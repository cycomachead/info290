not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
not
something
id
purchase
again
i
typically
enjoy
most
sixpoint
stuff
i
was
disappointed
in
sweet
action
unique
taste
but
not
for
me
the
worse
thing
ive
ever
tasted
worse
than
lambic
overall
very
much
a
light
american
pale
ale
or
an
overhopped
light
amber
very
good
summertime
beer
light
crisp
id
drink
it
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
seems
similar
to
madtrees
happy
amber
and
goose
island
honkers
ale
though
without
the
english
feeling
overall
not
exactly
my
preferred
type
of
beer
but
its
good
if
i
came
across
it
at
a
bar
id
probably
grab
a
can
and
have
them
pour
it
into
a
frosted
mug
simply
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
its
just
a
really
good
beer
kinda
hoppy
for
a
cream
ale
reviewing
because
outlier
this
cream
ale
is
superb
the
mouthfeel
really
stands
out
smell
is
citrusy
like
an
ipa
very
sessionable
and
a
really
refreshing
brew

i
like
it
had
it
on
draft
at
work
first
cream
ale
but
im
still
not
sure
if
its
a
true
representation
of
the
style
lightly
hoppy
sweet
and
smooth
very
balanced
and
drinkable
light
but
not
in
a
light
beer
way
need
to
drink
more
good
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
look
pours
with
a
nice
creamy
head
foam
dissipates
but
rings
on
the
surface
color
is
a
tan
honey
gold
smells
muted
hops
with
an
underlining
sweetness
taste
great
character
you
get
the
sweetness
blend
of
malt
and
hops
awesome
balance
feel
creamy
great
stuff
o
rare
that
a
beers
mouthfeel
stands
out
as
its
best
element
but
it
certainly
does
here
flavorwise
this
is
tasty
yet
average
but
overall
its
so
refreshing
ill
definitely
grab
more
to
sip
while
outside
during
the
summer
months
thought
it
was
like
an
apa
at
first
but
this
light
bodied
ale
is
deceivingly
complex
and
tasty
not
sure
what
a
cream
ale
is
or
what
category
to
put
this
in
but
its
pretty
good
sessionable
and
tasty
good
summer
beer
sweet
action
looks
good
smell
is
nothing
to
rave
about
but
not
bad
but
the
taste
a
little
hop
forward
with
an
amazing
honey
like
finish
w
just
a
little
sweetness
not
a
lot
smooth
and
coating
mouth
feel
perfect
carbonation
amazing
beer
its
actually
going
to
become
my
new
everyday
staple
sixpoint
makes
phenomenal
nectars
overall
this
is
going
to
end
up
in
the
regular
rotation
at
my
house

hhcccckkkk
pteh
o
pleasantly
surprised
not
big
on
cream
ales
but
i
like
this
one
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
lively
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
nice
with
sweet
flavors
coming
through
such
as
orange
and
banana
the
taste
was
much
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
still
well
balanced
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
refreshing
and
flavorful
beer
sixpoint
continues
to
impress
it
is
claimed
that
this
beer
is
a
cream
ale
i
missed
something
then
in
the
flavor
came
across
more
as
a
pale
then
a
cream
expected
it
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
in
its
flavor
very
smooth
excellent
for
this
style
of
beer
o
underwhelming
at
first
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
nearly
perfect
im
downing
my
third
since
starting
the
review
perhaps
its
just
me
but
the
hopforward
nature
of
this
one
isnt
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
cream
ale
this
beer
makes
me
think
that
i
still
dont
know
what
a
cream
ale
is
best
by
far
easy
drinking
with
notes
of
citrus
dancing
with
a
medium
touch
of
hops
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
solid
another
good
beer
from
sixpoint
o
while
it
may
be
difficult
to
place
this
beer
squarely
into
any
single
stylecategory
one
thing
remains
clear
regardless
of
what
you
consider
this
beer
consider
it
a
supremely
drinkable
example
smooth
light
and
very
refreshing
all
wrapped
up
in
a
lowabv
package
that
makes
this
beer
very
sessionable
recommended
brooklyn
at
bergn
made
great
first
impression
and
my
wife
never
wavered
i
decided
that
the
carbonation
was
tricking
me
into
thinking
that
it
was
distinctive
nose
is
lemony
and
hoppy
with
a
slight
note
of
chocolate
pours
slightly
hazed
dark
yellow
color
with
a
very
thin
light
airy
head
tastes
of
light
citrusy

with
the
hint
of
lemon

slight
bready

i
like
this

sessionable

oh
man
this

bought
from

by

this
beer
is
delicious
it
is
not
overly
hoppy
but
has
enough
to
balance
the
creamy
side
well
put
together
and
definitely
worth
drinking
hop
profile
of
the

but
with

and
more
of
the
creamy
great
job
sixpoint
overall
crisp
hoppy
and
satisfying
ale
hoppy
with
passionfruit
notes
lovely
as
bold
of
a
cream
ale
as
i
can
recall
i
love
this
thing
its
got
a
richer
and
bigger
malt
base
than
many
a
touch
of
caramel
color
to
the
mostly
clear
brew
the
head
is
white
and
long
lasting
and
the
nose
shows
some
serious
sweetness
i
get
honey
and
cereal
grain
with
maybe
some
milk
sugar
and
enough
hops
for
it
to
be
balanced
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
the
majority
of
the
sweetness
coming
up
front
i
love
the
bigger
malt
bill
it
does
so
much
for
the
flavors
here
and
really
takes
the
style
to
a
place
i
have
not
seen
it
go
before
the
bigger
body
i
think
also
helps
it
stand
out
from
the
crowd
carbonation
is
epic
and
im
left
wanting
more
and
more
of
this
beer
not
like
any
other
cream
ale
out
there
and
i
think
these
guys
have
done
an
expert
job
making
base
styles
unique
to
their
brewery
this
is
exceptional
on
all
counts
this
would
be
a
perfect
session
to
be
had
again
this
is
a
winner
i
love
this
and
its
nice
to
have
a
cream
ale
that
is
not
genny
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
and
a
staple
in
my
fridge
a
brew
thats
truly
pleasant
on
the
palate
a
sweet
malt
aroma
is
followed
by
a
blend
of
flavors
that
are
perfectly
balanced
fruity
sweet
and
bready
followed
by
herbs
and
spices
and
a
hops
bite
the
feel
is
quite
awesome
smooth
crisp
light
refreshing
and
delightfully
creamy
this
reminds
me
of
a
light
ipa
or
a
pale
ale
not
really
a
cream
ale
but
who
cares
its
still
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
its
very
enjoyable
ive
been
diggin
sixpoint
lately
o
what
a
great
beer
i
will
scoop
these
up
again
the
next
time
i
spot
them
overall
while
i
dont
necessarily
agree
with
the
cream
ale
status
its
an
irrelevant
issue
considering
this
is
delicious
clearly
this
beer
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
especially
in
a
weakened
state
of
mind
perhaps
a
fresh
taste
would
spark
new
views
but
with
this
little
sleep
its
just
not
the
refreshing
jolt
i
was
hoping
to
find
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
since
i
still
have
several
left
but
im
not
sure
that
i
would
offer
it
to
my
motherinlaw
all
in
all
solid
beer
with
a
strange
character
onot
a
bad
brew
at
all
well
balanced
and
tasty
as
well
sixpoint
does
a
good
job
with
the
brews
i
enjoyed
the
simplicity
of
this
one
with
the
good
taste
overall
excellent
sessionable
beer
would
drink
again
it
sort
of
tastes
like
a
cream
ale
crossed
with
a
fairly
hoppy
american
pale
ale
or
golden
ale
whatever
it
is
its
great
and
will
remind
you
of
why
you
love
beer
o
a
fantastic
balanced
beer
may
be
a
new
standard
favorite
pours
a
dark
orange
golden
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
bread
and
dough
vanilla
and
some
grassy
hops
flavor
is
similar
with
the
addition
of
some
orange
a
crisp
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
only
had
a
few
cream
ales
now
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
bunch
first
one
that
i
have
been
thoroughly
impressed
with
definitely
will
be
returning
to
this
one
a
great
option
when
seeking
a
sessionable
beer

the
beer
trails
off

after

up
with

the

consists

this
beer
smells
tastes
and
drinks
like
a
pale
im
not
exactly
sure
what
puts
it
into
the
cream
ale
category
accept
for
maybe
the
lack
of
a
malt
backbone
that
being
said
it
feels
intentional
while
drinking
it
not
like
just
an
under
done
pale
but
i
do
like
my
cream
ales
with
a
little
lactose
or
dextrose
which
this
seems
to
lack
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
slightly
fizzy
but
not
to
a
fault
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
from
this
style
this
beer
falls
into
the
different
but
not
bad
category
a
great
poolside
or
beach
option
when
looking
for
something
crisp
in
a
can
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
sixpoint
delivers
as
usual
to
it
does
indeed
taste
like
an
orange
creamsicle
but
it
has
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
back
end
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
well
put
together
too
sweet
to
be
an
apa
more
consistent
with
a
light
epa
with
higher
carbonation
level
that
makes
it
taste
crisper
honey
rolls
caramel
flavors
not
pronounced
but
qualities
of
both

creaminess
from
the
caramel
and
floral
sweetness

from
honey
rolls
i
could
drink
these
forever
another
very
good
brew
from
sixpoint
i
will
be
back
for
another
o
to
me
id
have
guessed
this
was
a
pale
ale
instead
of
a
cream
ale
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
sure
if
they
pegged
the
name
or
the
style
quite
right
continue
to
be
impressed
with
sixpoint
this
one
is
delicately
crafted
for
sure
hits
the
expectation
of
what
i
thought
a
cream

would
be
and
gives
me

of

sweet

is
a
great
quasisessionable
beer
even
when
its
past
its
prime
as
this
can
attests
drinks
like
a
hybrid
between
an
american
and
english
pale
ale
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
this
fresh
in
the
new
6x12oz
format
and
rereview
overall
this
has
been
described
as
a
cross
between
a
pale
ale
a
wheat
beer
and
a
cream
ale
its
that
hard
to
classify
but
who
cares
anyway
its
freaking
delicious
highly
recommended
you
wont
be
sorry
very
enjoyable
achieving
its
aims
of
a
sweet
and
bitter
balance
drinker
id
say
it
combined
the
best
of
both
beers
pours
clear
amber
with
a
ring
of
white
bubbles
on
the
nose
i
get
sweet
bready
malt
with
tropical
citrus
and
apples
plus
an
herbal
hop
presence
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
has
a
wider
array
of
fruit
blood
orange
apple
strawberry
apricot
along
with
that
same
sweet
bread
malt
it
doesnt
taste
like
any
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
nor
does
it
fit
into
any
known
category
but
man
is
it
tasty
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
a
medium
body
and
good
level
of
carbonation
average
but
drinkable
with
the
sweet
and
creamy
feel
being
a
highlight
for
me
the
main
problem
was
that
both
the
taste
the
smell
seemed
too
light
and
basic
for
me
ill
stick
with
bengali
tiger
over
this
one
every
time
sweet
action
is
an
old
friend
a
very
good
session
beer
that
defies
genre
thats
fine
by
me
as
the
result
is
a
distinctly
delicious
brew
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
definitely
at
the
top
of
its
style
one
could
drink
several
of
these
the
only
negative
may
be
the
price
point
at
9
99
for
416
oz
cans
this
one
will
be
part
of
my
regular
rotation
a
nice
beer
no
real
negative
comments
just
that
this
is
not
my
style
of
beer
i
want
maybe
a
little
more
cream
and
sweet
but
this
has
a
character
all
it
own
that
made
it
worthwhile
o
like
a
mediocre
extract
homebrew
aside
from
the
can
stating
this
was
dryhopped
there
was
no
indication
of
the
level
of
nastylooking
sediment
contained
within
hmmm
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
the
first
time
i
had
this
in
08
gonna
have
a
hard
time
recommending
this
one
cheers
a
solid
beer
the
cream
ale
doesnt
really
come
through
for
me
as
the
hopping
is
quite
high
for
that
style
but
it
works
nicely
on
the
whole
carbonation
seems
a
bit
fullon
sweet
action
has
a
reputation
of
balancing
the
bitterness
of
a
pale
ale
and
the
sweetness
of
cream
ale
and
it
does
just
that
a
great
beer
brewed
by
a
great
brewery
enjoyable
any
time
of
the
year
ive
always
loved
this
style
but
ive
never
really
enjoyed
a
single
example
ive
tried
so
far
lets
hope
this
sets
the
bar
anyway
it
pours
a
hazed
light
amber
hue
with
a
rather
fluffy
fluffy
three
finger
ever
present
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
nose
is
quite
feint
but
i
do
get
herbal
grassy
hops
along
with
barleyslight
vanilla
and
grainsthe
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
quite
satisfying
on
a
hot
night
like
tonight
but
the
tastes
are
not
up
to
par
its
just
grassy
herbal
hopsgrainsbarleycaramel
malts
and
the
finish
is
smooth
and
a
touch
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
and
overall
yeah
its
a
better
option
than
the
macro
on

aint

fresh
hops
very
nice
o
first
of
style
nice
surprise
easy
drinking
but
well
flavoursome
beer
although
in
the
hierarchy
of
beer
cream
ales
do
not
rank
highly
sweet
action
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
that
goes
well
with
unsophicated
but
beloved
american
fare
pizza
wings
brownies
bugers
and
fries

bought
one
of
the
six
packs
and
was
so
excited
to
drink
it
down
after
the
first
sip
proved
even
better
than
i
remember
it
i
ended
my
last
review
highlighting
the
balance
of
this
beer
but
ill
add
that
it
does
not
lack
character
and
i
think
sixpoints
beers
tend
to
improve
over
time
consciously
which
is
of
course
quite
commendable
kudos
yall
poured
to
a
sam
adams
glass
off
white
head
developed
very
frothy
with
mild
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
hazy
with
an
amber
to
gold
color
great
aroma
with
nice
hop
malt
notes
and
som
toffee
tasted
more
malty
with
caramel
notes
and
a
hint
of
cola
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
malty
lingering
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
cream
if
it
can
so
be
called
very
easy
to
drink
while
packing
a
lot
of
flavors
a
nice
change
up
from
a
typical
pale
def
worth
trying
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
didnt
really
like
it
perhaps
because
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
and
was
a
bit
too
bitter
for
a
cream
ale
and
had
a
little
bit
of
that
copper
penny
tang
that
you
can
find
in
esbs
after
having
this
a
few
times
now
though
i
find
myself
liking
it
the
metallic
note
and
the
hop
kick
perk
up
the
style
and
make
me
more
interested
in
having
more
than
one
a
fairly
pretty
beer
as
well
with
a
nice
copper
color
and
fine
head
and
creamy
enough
in
the
mouth
to
evince
the
style
an
interesting
twist
on
a
somewhat
boring
style
im
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
an
apa
wheat
or
cream
ale
but
it
is
always
delicious
there
is
a
zesty
orange
aroma
that
goes
along
with
pine
pale
ale
malt
up
front
in
the
mouth
creamy
with
a
bit
of
honey
cream
ale
either
way
you
slice
it
this
is
one
interesting
ride
that
is
delicious
when
fresh
overall
this
is
the
best
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
smooth
and
delicious
without
that
weird
almostcloying
flavor
well
balanced
and
perfect
for
any
time
of
the
year
o
a
nice
little
cream
ale
though
i
wish
the
flavors
separated
just
a
bit
more
really
good
for
the
style
though
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
and
can
even
see
it
being
a
staple
summer
beer
in
the
future
overall
decent
beer
sixpoint
is
winning
me
over
i
will
come
back
to
this
beer
at
some
point
ill
be
back
o
a
well
balanced
cream
ale
nice
hoppy
aroma
with
a
malty
flavor
and
a
smooth
lagerlike
finish
would
recommend
also
like
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
tallboys
o
nice
lager
with
much
more
flavor
than
most
i
enjoyed
this
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
i
think
it
has
lots
of
character
in
its
appearance
and
excitement
in
its
flavor
profile
sixpoint
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
names
because
it
is
always
turning
me
onto
styles
i
dont
normally
choose
i
feel
like
cream
ales
are
easy
to
find
but
good
cream
ales
are
not
that
easy
to
find
this
one
is
really
good
o
nice
simple
cream
ale
that
wont
let
u
put
the
glass
down
so
good
on
a
summer
day
the
best
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
this
one
was
dynamite
i
upped
this
upon
rereview
theres
more
going
on
in
this
beer
a
battle
between
sweet
barley
and
bitter
bitey
hops
it
gets
better
as
you
go
and
as
it
warms
deserves
a
try
o
the
mellow
but
well
balanced
flavor
is
interesting
and
the
dried
orange
hops
are
a
nice
character
but
it
turns
watery
as
it
starts
to
open
there
isnt
a
lot
of
other
depth
to
make
is
sessionable
o
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
the
highlights
here
for
me
i
would
definitely
have
another
o
very
good
flavor
behind
a
lightly
aromatic
beer
that
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
cream
ale
and
a
pa
o
strange
brew
this
uniquely
delicious
id
have
another
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
medium
orange
with
rocky
cream
colored
head
streaks
of
wet
lace
down
the
glass
smell
apricot
bread
slight
cattiness
taste
nectarine
juice
orange
peppery
caramel
snappy
grainy
creamy
very
active
carbonation
a
very
flavorful
version
of
the
style
nice
this
beer
wasnt
short
on
hops
at
all
and
the
hop
character
was
intense
but
without
oil
or
too
much
bitter
the
simcoe
never
got
catty
and
the
bread
while
sweet
never
outclassed
the
fruit
easy
to
see
why
sixpoint
was
1
at
the
nys
tap
festival
so
far
each
offering
is
unique
and
expertly
done
this
was
a
graceful
interpretation
of
a
cream
ale
that
drank
easily
and
with
a
little
panache
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
to
the
palate
o
enjoyable
overall
raul
would
do
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
his
first
option
bottom
line
you
could
drink
two
of
these
guys
in
18
minutes
easily
grab
some
overall
disappointed
it
is
an
ok
ipa
i
guess
but
not
what
i
wanted
should
have
read
there
website
if
you
want
a
cream
ale
dont
bother
overall
interested
brew
worth
a
try
for
sure
sixpoint
never
ceases
to
amaze
not
really
my
bag
but
true
to
style
and
quite
good
at
it
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
orange
with
a
slight
red
tint
with
a
froffy
head
smells
of
grassy
notes
that
dominate
the
beer
but
otherwise
pretty
bland
tastes
of
watery
light
grain
with
very
slight
hop
bite
not
very
many
different
flavors
beer
is
very
light
bodied
and
refreshing
goes
down
smooth
and
good
carbonation
overall
an
above
average
beer
o
i
see
why
this
is
ranked
so
high
ill
definitely
have
this
one
again
cheers
abort
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
cream
ale
as
listed
definitely
a
style
combo
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
type
of
style
i
liked
this
one
because
it
i
different
for
me
o
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
sixpoint
are
masters
at
the
dry
hop
all
of
their
beers
that
ive
tried
have
this
in
common
the
smell
on
this
one
was
incredible
especially
when
i
was
expecting
very
little
because
of
the
style
on
top
of
that
this
beer
had
a
lot
more
character
than
any
other
cream
ale
ive
had
strong
smell
of
orange
and
tangerine
fair
amount
of
carbonation
quite
like
an
orangina
but
not
that
sweet
i
like
it
well
enough
now
in
20
degree
weather
with
a
blizzard
bearing
down
but
it
seems
like
a
perfect
match
for
spring
and
summer
baseball
hot
dogs
and
freshly
mowed
grass
could
use
more
balance
in
the
flavour
tangy
and
drinkable
but
needs
more
depth
one
of
the
best
sessionable
american
beers
out
there
a
great
beer
from
sixpoint
i
had
a
tough
time
deciding
exactly
how
this
beer
should
be
classified
or
rated
but
my
feelings
and
my
rating
improved
with
each
sip
it
is
a
little
lighter
than
other
craft
brews
but
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
beer
in
its
own
way
and
a
good
introductory
beer
for
newer
fans
of
craft
beer
products
this
beer
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
that
is
heavy
on
crystal
malt
somewhat
tasty
but
the
victim
of
wrong
categorization
the
malt
is
way
too
big
for
a
cream
ale
as
is
the
alcohol
o
very
good
beer
here
the
extra
pop
of
hops
make
this
cream
ale
not
so
cream
ale
like
but
the
big
sweet
caramel
malt
is
so
nice
worth
looking
for
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
sixpoint
a
nicely
balanced
mix
of
hops
and
malts
first
cream
ale
in
a
while
so
i
wasnt
sure
how
much
id
like
it
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
brew
not
hard
to
get
down
at
all
i
e
not
too
sweet
or
overly
creamy
this
had
a
fair
amount
of
hops
but
it
wasnt
too
hopped
up
either
a
nice
light
drinker
for
late
night
or
a
summer
afternoon
pretty
enjoyable
o
this
brew
definitely
lived
up
to
the
balanced
billing
on
the
can
this
is
a
need
to
try
simply
one
of
the
most
balanced
brew
you
will
have
o
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
cream
ale
nice
and
full
of
flavor
they
hit
all
the
marks
with
fruity
yeast
esters
nice
hop
aroma
and
maltcorn
adjunct
properties
not
traditional
in
sense
but
a
damn
good
drinking
beer
for
all
seasons
perhaps
i
dont
know
what
a
good
cream
ale
is
or
just
dont
like
cream
ales
but
this
is
the
top
rated
cream
ale
on
ba
and
its
not
doing
much
for
me
she
looks
mighty
nice
a
bright
orange
body
and
healthy
white
foam
head
it
definitely
goes
down
easy
but
so
do
a
lot
of
other
more
flavorful
styles
bready
light
citrus
hops
dry
finish
sharp
carbonation
nothing
wrong
here
but
its
a
tough
style
to
really
run
back
to
good
stuff
o
this
beer
is
an
oxymoron
in
a
glass
its
very
complex
in
its
simplicity
part
wheat
ale
part
pale
ale
and
part
cream
ale
with
a
big
wallop
of
hops
on
paper
it
sounds
very
odd
and
busy
in
reality
it
works
rather
seamlessly
and
weaves
a
simple
progression
of
flavors
into
something
much
greater
than
the
sum
of
their
parts
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
but
in
the
end
it
all
translates
to
one
thing
a
simple
enjoyable
drinking
experience
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
im
also
amazed
at
how
fresh
this
still
tastes
even
toward
the
end
of
its
lifespan
is
this
what
cans
can
do
overall
probably
the
smoothest
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
tasty
and
very
drinkable
ill
definitely
have
this
again
if
i
run
across
it
smooth
light
complex
and
flavorful
this
is
not
your
typical
brew
it
holds
the
balance
between
flavor
and
refreshment
better
than
nearly
any
ale
i
have
come
across
didnt
see
having
a
third
cream
ale
today
but
at
least
this
one
is
a
bit
of
an
oddball
take
on
the
style
sort
of
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
grass
light
flowers
light
orange
rind
and
a
streak
of
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grass
and
wheat
really
strangling
out
everything
else
what
results
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
seems
a
touch
outofplace
and
detracts
from
the
proceedings
for
me
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
despite
the
bitterness
which
isnt
all
that
powerful
anyway
this
is
a
solid
cream
ale
it
may
not
be
all
that
indicative
of
the
style
but
its
enjoyable
enough
overall
im
sure
this
is
how
a
cream
ale
should
taste
this
definitely
isnt
a
genny
overall
this
was
a
tasty
one
and
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
sampled
this
year
it
might
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
but
i
thought
it
fit
perfectly
it
has
some
strong
flavors
so
id
probably
only
enjoy
one
and
move
on
to
something
else
but
its
a
great
way
to
start
the
evening
o
a
great
goto
beer
that
can
be
readily
found
year
round
nice
aroma
of
herbal
and
fruity
hops
very
well
balanced
between
malt
and
wheat
sweetness
and
bitterness
from
its

citric
aftertaste
gets
to
it
fairly
quick
mostly
orange
liked
this
beer
good
drinkability
with

o
wonderful
flavor
fruit
pepper
slight
bitterness
with
well

nothing

about

maybe
not
the
most
memorable
one
every
either
oits
a
great
beer
ive
had
this
a
lot
and
its
definitely
something
you
can
drink
over
and
over
again
and
might
be
even
better
out
of
the
can
its
a
pretty
unique
beer
too
doesnt
taste
like
other
cream
ales
ive
had
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
exceptional
nothing
really
stands
out
in
this
one
but
nothing
really
takes
away
either
o
nice
beer
complex
and
balanced
not
sure
what
style
i
would
have
put
this
in
if
i
had
to
classify
it
or
what
i
would
have
though
of
this
in
a
blind
taste
test
it
has
characteristics
of
an
ipa
but
more
malty
and
chewy
with
the
body
and
heft
of
a
cream
ale
an
easy
drinker
at
5
2
abv
to
boot
onever
would
have
thought
this
was
a
cream
ale
the
hops
do
not
balance
with
the
malt
which
was
the
main
drawback
to
me
overall
very
nice
brew
a
lot
of
unexpecteds
not
very
similar
to
any
other
beer
ive
tried
overall
it
was
great
and
tasty
with
a
real
nice
feel
and
high
drinkability
grab
a
can
and
enjoy
the
best
cream
ale
on
the
market
this
is
a
new
wave
cream
ale
and
its
a
game
changer
o
overall
i
like
it
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
intense
cream
ales
i
have
experienced
lightly
hoppy
another
winner
to
have
in
summertime
when
i
have
issues
finding
new
berliner
weisss
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
nothing
i
would
expect
from
a
cream
ale
at
all
this
is
more
like
how
a
hefeweisen
tastes
i
find
it
very
peculiar
that
this
would
be
identified
as
a
cream
ale
i
feel
like
some
other
category
would
suit
it
far
better
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
this
is
what
i
would
want
from
a
summer
ale
on
the
rare
occasions
that
im
in
the
mood
for
one
i
got
some
sweet
sweet
action
tonight
disclaimer
i
am
a
devoted
sixpoint
fan
i
like
their
philosophy
i
like
their
artwork
packaging
and
pint
cans
i
like
the
amazing
color
of
their
beers
and
i
like
drinking
them
sweet
action
was
no
exception
the
can
said
somthing
about
love
and
the
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
thats
exactly
what
this
cream
ale
is
a
perfect
balance
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue

back
to
the
question
is
sixpoints
cream
ale
considered
a
craft
beer
because
its
a
microbrewery
who
created
such
it
is
when
it
tastes
more

thought
i
would
be
able

drink
this
quicker

the
low

and
that
its

i
could
only
do
about
two
gulps
each
time
i
reached
for
the
glass
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
thats
the
way
it
is
for
me
this
was
a
great
beer
and
it
knocks
bengali

in
terms
of
just

theres
a
definite
grainy

the
the
taste

this
is
quite
nice
flavorful
but
light
really
refreshing
i
love
the
new
sixpoint
cans
but
sweet
action
is
still
not
my
favorite
brew
from
this
brewer
i
dont
know
how
this
defines
as
cream
ale
exactly
however
this
is
absolutely
delicious
and
brewed
to
great
standards
overall
great
session
beer
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
pours
a
hazy
shadowed
golden
pale
color
visibly
carbonated
with
a
huge
stiff
off
white
head
that
resists
fading
and
leaves
an
impressive
amount
of
belgian
lacing
behind
my
first
sense
of
the
nose
raised
a
crisp
pilsner
note
of
spice
followed
quickly
by
a
fruity
peach
the
mouth
is
creamy
smooth
nicely
carbonated
with
a
substantial
presence
to
the
body
full
flavored
nicely
balanced
spicy
peach
and
sweet
malts
clean
crisp
finish
to
the
mouth
while
the
taste
lingers
nicely
the

really
lends
to
the
overall
drinkability
found
these
4pk
cans
at
premier
gourmet
in
kenmore
ny
2
50
ea
or
9
50
for
the
pack
really
nice
offering
from
team
sixpoint
overall
with
a
name
like
sweet
action
i
was
hoping
for
the
malts
to
be
a
bit
more
obvious
and
have
more
character
i
had
one
prior
to
this
review
and
the
prominence
of
the
hops
made
me
think
it
was
skunked
though
its
short
stay
in
the
freezer
to
cool
it
down
probably
numbed
some
of
the
malt
flavors
the
one
at
proper
temperature
was
much
better
however
and
was
a
lot
more
palatable
i
can
see
this
being
an
excellent
afterdinner
beer
on
a
summer
evening
i
suggest
buying
this
beer
when
it
presents
itself
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
beer
seems
to
grow
on
me
after
a
while
some
interesting
flavors
here
worth
a
shot
overall
its
a
great
brew
combines
tons
of
different
flavors
and
qualities
with
nothing
dominating
but
everything
working
in
harmony
doesnt
quite
fit
into
a
cream
ale
category
id
put
this
as
a
cross
between
a
cream
ale
and
an
ipa
maybe
interesting
blend
of
malt
and
hop
flavor
profiles
both
are
fairly
prominent
brings
a
lot
of
different
things
to
the
table
and
certainly
worth
trying
o
i
think
sixpoint
once
described
this
as
a
halfipa
and
i
can
see
that
the
hops
are
prominent
for
the
style
whatever
that
is
but
not
like
in
an
ipa
i
can
drink
this
all
night
bill
sweet
acton
is
certainly
worth
a
try
drink
my
first
sixpoint
beer
very
tasty
and
balanced
its
creamy
but
turned
upside
down
id
like
more
of
this
also
more
from
them
this
is
gonna
be
one
of
my
goto
session
beers
this
summer
its
tasty
enough
to
put
under
the
flavor
microscope
while
still
being
drinkable
and
light
enough
to
pound
during
a
ballgame

with

this

wasnt

which
i
still
have
an
affinity
for

two

retention

a

amber
colored
beer
with
a

sweet
not
sweet
was
the
nose
which
was
grassy
minty
and
floral
cream
ale
just
got
schooled
yo
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
there
was
a
soft
as
opposed
to
sharp
bitterness
in
the
mouth
sweet
this
is
as
excited
about
a
canned
beer
as
i
have
been
in
a
while
finish
was
mildly
bitter
enough
to
sustain
a
hops
junkie
like
me
but
still
mild
enough
not
to
drive
off
the
uninitiated
will
this
be
going
into
my
cooler
does
my
main
man
sweet
sweetback
mistrust
the
man
yo
bring
it
on
for
me
though
ill
choose
another
still
cheers
to
sixpoint
this
beer
is
right
in
the
wheelhouse
for
almost
all
of
brooklyn
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
cream
ale
with
a
decidedly
unique
take
its
refreshing
and
the
16
oz
tallboy
is
a
format
to
die
for
a
semi
clear
golden
orange
with
about
an
inch
of
big
bubbly
head
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
in
the
nose
with
an
orange
rindearthy
hop
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
sweet
and
candied
malt
texture
a
good
balance
of
fruity
hop
with
a
sugary
malt
body
a
earthy
almost
piney
texture
finishes
it
off
but
the
creamy
sweetness
subdues
any
hop
bitterness
leaving
only
the
fruity
flavor
odoverall
i
tried
this
last
out
of
the
four
sixpoint
cans
available
in
my
area
bengali
righteous
crisp
this
one
is
my
second
favorite
behind
the
bengali
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
flavor
tucked
away
in
this
can
very
sessionable
great
for
the
warm
weather
overall
sixpoint
refuses
to
disappoint
with
the
cans
tastes
like
the
aroma
orange
marmalade
candied
tangerine
fresh
baked
bread
burnt
sugar
whole
grains
yeasty
on
the
finish
mouth
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
end
is
quick
and
slightly
dry
nice
back
porch
beer
overall
great
beer
for
almost
everyone
balanced
flavors
mean
that
hop
lovers
would
enjoy
it
enough
despite
its
malty
characteristics
and
vice
versa
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
brew
to
please
a
crowd
especially
during
a
party
this
would
be
a
great
route
to
go
sweet
action
has
a
light
caramel
sweetness
to
it
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
certainly
fullbodied
i
poured
this
can
at
fridge
temperature
but
didnt
find
too
many
additional
layers
of
flavor
as
it
warmed
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
creamy
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
though
i
wouldnt
necessarily
characterize
it
as
a
summer
beer
come
fall
assuming
these
are
still
available
in
boston
i
will
certainly
buy
another
fourpack
overall
rating
goes
up
here
because
this
is
incredibly
flavorful
for
a
small
beer
very
drinkable
balanced
damn
nice
a
cream
ale
i
dont
know
about
that
very
well
done
better
than
the
double
and
triple
actions
too
o
first
time
having
this
one
and
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
cream
ale
that
doesnt
really
attempt
to
be
anything
that
its
not
really
loved
the
balance
and
the
smoothness
in
this
one
pretty
delicious
and
i
havent
really
had
too
many
a
cream
ale
in
my
day
i
will
likely
be
revisiting
this
one
cheers
would
i
buy
more
of
it
definitely
great
beer
loved
all
16
oz
of
it
and
will
certainly
be
buying
more
cubes
this
is
a
beer
that
runs
right
up
the
middle
the
balance
is
really
something
the
clash
can
you
even
call
it
that
of
sweet
barley
and
bitter
hops
is
really
perfectly
matched
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
this
years
aprihop
very
quaffable
and
tasty
though
i
personally
prefer
the
crisp
o
overall
this
is
a
really
great
take
on
a
cream
ale
the
mouth
was
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
and
makes
me
feel
like
this
isnt
something
i
could
drink
all
night
long
without
getting
sick
of
it
but
to
have
a
pint
of
this
definitely
overall
none
of
the
flavors
stand
out
but
the
brew
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
o
just
a
great
product
from
sixpoint
and
their
canning
releases
are
a
win
for
me
there
are
woefully
few
top
shelf
cream
ales
and
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
great
summer
beer
d
duper
drinkable
the
flavors
stay
interesting
and
complex
enough
while
never
feeling
heavy
on
the
flip
side
it
also
avoids
feeling
empty
and
watered
down
o
this
is
unlike
most
cream
ales
i
have
had
before
interesting
for
a
newly
available
16
oz
can
as
a
serving
means
wouldnt
run
to
get
another
4
pack
but
look
forward
to
sharing
with
others
a
great
beer
great
refreshing
flavor
mouthfeel
and
aroma
just
a
really
great
beer
all
around
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
really
nice
white
head
good
retention
and
some
swell
lacing
good
so
far
the
nose
was
really
quite
faint
there
was
a
touch
of
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
pretty
tame
really
tame
in
fact
the
taste
countered
with
an
explosion
of
flavor
perfect
balance
between
light
breadygrainy
sweetness
and
floral
and
herbal
hops
nice
and
delicate
very
refreshing
best
cream
ale
by
far
the
feel
backed
that
up
it
was
nice
and
crisp
with
a
solidly
bitter
finish
really
well
done
enthusiastic
thumbs
up
sixpoint
the
beer
appears
transparent
and
orange
colored
with
a
good
sized
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
with
a
light
dose
of
malt
the
flavor
is
really
tasty
with
a
very
subtle
fruitiness
and
enjoyable
malt
flavors
this
is
by
far
the
best
cream
ale
i
have
ever
had
the
beer
finishes
with
a
healthy
amount
of
bitterness
more
so
than
expected
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
is
the
top
rated
cream
ale
o
quite
a
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
could
see
myself
going
through
a
twelve
pack
of
this
and
just
wanting
more
totally
diggin
this
beer
i
havent
had
it
in
so
long
got
a
very
hay
body
of
the
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
finger
depth
offwhite
head
in
a
nonic
pint
smells
very
hoppy
like
a
citrus
variety
grapefruity
and
the
taste
is
there
too
its
got
an
english
quality
to
it
in
the
malt
dept
more
bready
with
of
course
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
very
tasteful
and
refreshing
beer
i
cant
wait
to
see
it
in
a
can
overall
interesting
some
interesting
flavors
blended
well
nothing
too
heavy
little
sticky
on
the
finish
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
i
find
it
to
be
very
refreshing
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
but
the
mild
hop
flavor
balances
it
quite
nicely
i
like
this
one
and
i
would
try
it
again
for
sure
d
good
drinkability
a
nice
brew
to
revisit
in
the
summer
feel
is
smooth
a
quenching
due
to
the
excellent
hop
blend
medium
weight
and
a
mild
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
makes
this
a
top
drawer
session
ale
great
drinkability
with
this
brew
cant
even
taste
any
alcohol
in
it
and
at
a

this
feels
like
it
was
made
for
sessioning
it
isnt
very
complex
tastewise
but
its
balanced
wellmade
and
tasty
sixpoint
definitely
has
a
winner
here
glad
i
was
able
to
have
it
and
share
it
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
an
amalgamation
of
a
few
different
things
but
at
its
heart
is
a
moderately
hoppy
cream
ale
worth
a
shot
drinkability
the
first
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
and
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
definitely
strays
a
bit
from
other
beers
ive
had
ontap
and
this
is
something
i
would
enjoy
having
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
semimalty
the
flavors
are
all
really
subdued
there
is
an
odd
bitterness
to
this
beer
that
i
cant
tell
if
its
from
mild
hopping
or
over
extraction
i
guess
it
all
comes
together
into
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
blonde
by
a
long
shot
pours
a
copper
color
with
minimal
head
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
of
sweet
carmel
malts
faint
orangy
sweetness
and
musty
grassy
hops
taste
brings
a
somewhat
candied
fruity
sweet
backing
to
the
honey
and
carmel
tastes
but
lingering
is
a
somewhat
stale
grain
taste
hops
are
present
but
seem
to
enhance
the
sweetness
medium
bodied
yet
oily
and
chewy
very
lightly
carbonated
a
decent
beer
that
really
didnt
appeal
to
my
tastes
and
seems
more
agressive
than
its
classification
slightly
dry
hoppy
mediu
body
which
is
on
the
fuller
end
of
the
spectrum
creamy
with
hints
of
crisp
light
fruit
dry
piney
hops
pale
malt
biscuit
apple
pear
sweet
lactic
creaminess
and
a
dry
earthy
bitter
hop
finish
excellently
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
wasnt
expecteing
much
from
this
beer
but
other
than
the
aroma
i
really
enjoyed
it
recommended
drinkability
i
had
another
it
was
particularly
important
for
this
place
as
a
beerwingsports
bar
id
have
it
at
a
barbecue
for
me
personally
it
caught
on
fairly
quick
which
means
it
could
been
enjoyed
at
any
point
in
time
really
a
good
beer
would
like
try
it
in
bottled
form
cant
drink
tons
though
because
i
find
it
a
bit
too
sweet
seems
like
a
blend
of
very
strong
flavours
in
disarray
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
really
drinkable
for
me
anyway
hop
flavors
are
intense
and
quite
impressive
loads
of
flavor
without
a
ton
of
bitterness
i
would
think
this
has
to
be
consumed
fresh
for
maximum
enjoyment
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
rather
unique
offering
over
all
a
pretty
decent
blond
ale
not
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
but
its
easy
to
drink
and
is
pretty
refreshing
not
a
bad
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
dirty
blonde
with
dissipating
white
head
a
seductive
aroma
of
sweet
malt
candy
honey
and
wheat
characteristics
light
hop
flavors
of
citrus
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
center
and
finish
floral
notes
a
dab
of
honey
and
butter
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
malt
foundation
an
exceptionally
sessionable
ale
that
hits
the
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
malts
and
balances
it
with
hop
bitterness
better
than
trapeze
artist
sweet
action
dude
what
does
mine
say
sweet
action
pours
a
medium
gold
with
light
carbonation
and
a
perfect
dense
foamy
head
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
west
coast
hops
emanate
from
the
glass
almost
suggesting
a
sweet
taste
sensation
to
follow
but
alas
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
outstanding
moderate
to
generous
bitterness
slightly
off
dry
and
ultra
smooth
in
the
mouth
this
beer
reads
like
a
lighthearted
ipa
without
having
hopping
that
is
too
oversaturated
which
would
disable
the
insane
drinkability
factor
of
this
brew
fresh
and
satisfying
this
is
a
brew
that
must
be
sampled
given
the
opportunity
bravo
overall
very
delicious
and
too
easy
to
drink
down
quickly
1
of
the
best
ive
had
from
sixpoint
dquite
spicy
and
tasty
and
very
nice
summer
brew
i
have
been
impressed
with
sixpoint
beers
poured
a
clear
amber
orange
body
with
great
head
a
mild
smell
of
plain
hops
and
a
little
sweet
malt
a
medium
body
that
is
light
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
vanilla
sweet
malt
taste
as
it
goes
down
mild
hoppiness
and
the
brew
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
not
a
complex
beer
but
one
that
is
nice
to
relax
with
poured
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
very
thin
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
was
decidedly
sweet
orange
pineapple
with
some
maltiness
and
some
grassiness
the
sweetness
was
way
too
overpowering
in
the
flavor
like
overripe
pineapple
and
orange
with
a
dry
grassyherbal
finish
the
flavor
was
mitigated
somewhat
by
the
soft
thinbodied
mouthfeel
but
the
sweetness
was
just
over
the
top
not
much
balance
overall
it
tasted
like
a
thinbodied
doubleipa
with
huge
amounts
of
citrus
and
no
bitter
hop
balance
was
very
surprised
to
get
this
result
after
reading
all
of
the
stellar
reviews
and
awards
out
of

ill
give
it
a
second

this
beer
is
light
crisp
clean
and
very
drinkable
although
it
is
not
particularly
complex
it
is
well
made
and
tasty
im
certainly
ready
for
a
second
by
the
time
i
finish
and
i
wont
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
particularly
during
an
evening
of
dining
and
conversation
with
friends

this
beer
was
extremely
quaffable

a

i
remain

this

as
that

ive

as
a
beer
overall
its
somewhat

isnt

compete
with
any
great
beers
out

for
what
it
is
i
honestly
dont

can
do
better

down
incredibly
easily
and
would

well
with
a

foods

also
tasting
good
enough

this
is
something
id
want
to
have
a

at

i
would
consider
this

to

not

by

stopped
by
the
brewpub
for
a
beer
after
work
last
week
wanted
something
light
with
my

fries

with

this
is

an
approachable
beer
for
the
masses
and
a
good
one
to
pair
with
some
barbecue
fare
for
the
upcoming
warm
months
overall
i
dont
even
need
to
factor
out
my
preference
for
dark
beers
this
is
darn
good
if
you
are
looking
for
a
unique
beer
keep
looking
this
is
one
of
those
that
takes
a
known
set
of
characteristics
and
just
does
them
well
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
in
the
warm
weather
this
beer
simply
tastes
very
good
o
this
is
prolly
the
best
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
spotted
cow
sort
of
holds
the
standard
for
me
but
this
is
better
i
think
the
notes
are
subtle
but
they
are
there
it
makes
it
both
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
and
a
beer
that
is
worth
trying
for
the
biggest
beer
geek
overall
unfortunately
there
are
some
problems
with
this
beer
it
was
given
to
me
from
a
friend
so
not
sure
the
age
or
how
it
was
stored
other
than
the
problems
listed
above
if
fresh
this
could
be
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
would
give
another
try
with
a
fresher
bottle
again
my
pour
got
me
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
pale
light
lemonyellow
with
a
slight
haze
nose
smelled
strongly
of
grassy
noble
hops
i
love
truth
in
advertising
mouthfeel
was
soft
not
really
thin
nor
medium
but
more
like
softened
water
i
was
really
feeling
the
grassy
hops
on
the
tongue
and
wishing
that
more
cream
ales
especially
those
of
my
childhood
could
have
beenbe
like
this
finish
was
semidry
and
very
refreshing
this
would
be
a
wonderful
summer
beer
or
a
nice
break
on
a
day
of
heavy
drinking
if
only
they
would
put
this
in
cans
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
this
is
a
well
done
version
of
the
style
and
anyone
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
cream
ale
this
one
will
satisfy
it
o
easy
drinking
beer
very
crisp
and
clean
but
not
overly
impressive
would
definitely
drink
it
again
yet
would
want
something
with
more
flavor
if
im
sharing
good
grilling
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
aroma
was
very
subtle
not
much
there
at
all
smell
was
mostly
malty
sweetness
taste
was
balanced
nice
hop
flavor
with
a
little
malt
flavor
highly
carbonated
but
pretty
smooth
very
light
body
it
could
make
a
good
thirst
quenching
session
beer
but
its
still
just
average
o
overall
a
nice
beer
would
go
down
great
at
the
pool
overall
its
an
average
beer
nothing
amazing
but
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
if
i
wanted
something
to
quench
my
thirst
and
was
offered
this
i
would
not
turn
it
down
cheers
overall
the
most
solidly
average
beer
i
have
ever
had
better
than
a
macro
but
doesnt
really
bring
much
of
anything
to
the
table
o
carolina
blonde
is
certainly
not
a
terrible
beer
but
the
smell
and
aroma
keep
bringing
me
back
to
feeling
like
im
drinking
an
unfermented
carbonated
bottle
of
light
wort
maybe
its
aimed
to
the
masses
maybe
its
their
every
day
lawnmower
beer
all
i
know
is
in
the
end
foothills
carolina
blonde
is
a
refreshing
beer
to
kick
back
with
o
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
here
but
over
all
pretty
flat
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
good
almost
an
off
flavor
in
the
aroma
i
expected
a
little
more
malt
character
for
a
cream
ale
could
easily
pass
off
as
a
light
beer
overall
a
tasty
if
not
slightly
boring
blonde
ale
although
not
a
lot
is
going
on
i
couldnt
really
detect
any
off
flavors
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
worth
a
try
poured
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
looking
beer
with
a
golden
straw
hazy
look
apple
cider
quality
with
a
nice
2
finger
pillow
off
white
head
nose
was
of
orange
peel
citrus
biscuits
and
honey
not
overpowering
but
adequate
taste
was
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
nice
straw
citrus
hit
on
the
front
and
the
noble
hops
add
a
punch
to
the
end
not
over
the
top
hops
but
a
good
balance
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
again
not
overpowering
feel
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
on
the
front
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
to
add
to
the
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
blonde
with
nice
character
and
very
sessionable
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
which
was
a
distraction
for
me
good
blend
of
hops
and
citrus
notes
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
that
stands
out
as
spectacular
wouldnt
turn
one
down
and
the
low
price
helps
overall
a
pretty
basic
brew
that
was
more
like
a
light
beer
than
a
cream
ale
although
it
did
have
a
decent
bitter
undertone
to
it
served
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
weizen
glass
at
the
charlotte
airport
long
layover
pours
a
straw
gold
with
a
translucent
clarity
head
was
half
inch
rocky
and
bright
white
and
eventually
settled
into
a
solid
skim
nose
is
clean
and
somewhat
subdued
primarily
biscuity
malts
and
perhaps
some
citric
acid
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
there
is
more
of
a
cereal
grain
presence
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
overall
not
a
bad
american
blonde
a
decent
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
pairs
well
with
food
but
theres
nothing
overly
distinctive
about
this
offering
in
my
opinion
o
not
an
offensively
bad
beer
but
certainly
unremarkable
o
very
sessionable
but
nothing
outstanding
have
had
several
other
beers
from
foothills
that
i
have
enjoyed
more
than
this
one
seems
like
the
abv
for
this
beer
is
either
very
low
or
very
well
hidden
a
very
sessionable
beer
but
a
forgettable
beer
overall
overall
i
thought
this
was
rather
nice
for
a
nice
sessionable
blond
ale
i
had
not
ever
had
anything
from
carolina
before
but
it
was
nice
to
see
that
they
obviously
put
some
effort
into
what
they
do
this
was
definitely
a
quality
ale
and
something
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
especially
on
a
warm
day
trying
the
foothills
brewing
carolina
blonde
at
the
taste
of
carolina
at
the
b
concourse
in
charlotte
nc
airport
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
not
much
lacing
the
smell
includes
hints
of
lemon
and
barley
the
taste
bursts
with
a
tart
lemon
zing
the
malt
never
realy
kicks
in
to
balance
the
beer
teh
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
big
carbonation
overall
it
is
ok
would
be
great
for
the
summer
time
nice
strawberry
smell
good
taste
with
nice
a
strawberry
flavor
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
enough
drink
and
im
more
than
glad
to
finish
the
6
pack
but
if
you
hadnt
told
me
it
was
a
strawberry
beer
im
not
sure
id
have
realised
it
was
its
very
subtle
im
not
saying
that
id
like
it
to
taste
like
strawberry
syrup
but
if
somethings
gonna
call
itself
carolina
strawberry
id
expect
the
berry
taste
to
be
somewhat
more
prominent
than
it
is
in
this
beer

meh
it
is
a
darn
near
good
and
perfect
cream
ale
just
worth
a
try
pretty
tasty
sounding
beer
that
when
it
came
to
the
actual
taste
was
a
bit
flat
it
reminded
me
of
a
lager
and
i
couldnt
taste
any
of
the
creaminess
it
was
a
nice
easy
beer
though
so
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
it
on
a
summer
day
truly
one
of
a
kind
it
finishes
like
a
stella
without
the
taste
of
skunk
feel
is
5
because
it
nails
the
cream
moniker
not
something
you
find
in
a
lightweight
ale
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice

plus
foamy

which
does
leave
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky

behind
the
nose

malty
yeasty

sweet
the
taste
is
pretty
good
malty
nice

medium

with

overall
a
tasty
brew
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
started
down
the
road
to
becoming
a
beer
snob
aficionado
fond
memories
drinking
this
along
the
seashore
o
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
o
i
never
thought
id
be
blown
away
by
a
cream
ale
but
this
is
just
an
outstanding
easy
drinking
and
incredibly
well
balanced
beer
lots
of
nice
malt
sweetness
with
a
gentle
hop
bitterness
its
light
on
the
cream
but
still
enjoyable
subtle
flavors
and
aromas
but
quite
tasty
is
the
time
is
taken
to
appreciate
them
this
would
be
a
great

i
cant

over
the
smell
its
not

just
not
what
you
want

theres
no

that
id
buy
it
again
just
nothing
going
on
at

a
disappointment
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
a
decent
and
drinkable
cream
ale
the
nose
is
a
bit
corny
for
me
but
this
beer
is
definitely
headed
in
the
right
direction
this
is
an
ok
brew
but
it
reminds
me
of
nothing
about
a
cream
ale
drinkable
yes
but
unfortunately
not
that
memorable
either
o
a
very
mild
and
light
beer
that
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
i
like
them
a
little
more
potent
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
m
its
fairly
light
bodied
the
feel
is
great
and
it
shows
what
the
style
should
be
in
that
regard
its
very
soft
without
being
weak
light
and
downright
creamy
even
fluffy
but
with
a
light
crispness
all
the
way
though
if
the
crispness
gave
a
little
more
nip
all
the
way
this
is
perfect
as
it
is
its
what
you
want
a
beer
like
this
one
to
feel
like
o
this
is
very
unique
unlike
any
cream
ale
that
ive
ever
had
o
not
the
best
cream
ale
i
have
had
but
not
bad
overall
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
awhile
now
and
i
have
enjoyed
every
drop
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
the
body
was
also
fairly
typical
medium
clean
and
with
a
nicely
dry
finish
drier
than
a
lot
of
other
examples
which
seem
to
run
more
towards
the
sweet
side
drinkability
was
very
nice
the
22
went
down
easily
enough
although
id
much
rather
have
12oz
bottles
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
nothing
really
stands
out
either
good
or
bad
but
the
22oz
format
makes
it
doubtful
ill
grab
many
more
of
these
if
these
were
available
in12oz
bottles
id
throw
a
sixer
in
the
fridge
to
have
around
as
an
easy
drinking
everyday
brew
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
light
pleasant
and
in
keeping
with
the
style
but
i
dont
really
feel
the
need
to
revisit
this
one
delicious
could
drink
this
all
day
reviewing
from
notes
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
pelican
served
a
light
golden
color
with
white
head
carbonation
is
visible
rising
in
the
beer
dead
eventually
recedes
to
a
ring
in
my
glass
looks
generally
pleasing
for
a
summer
day
smell
is
floral
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
smooth
sweetness
then
i
get
some
citrus
and
floral
before
the
beer
finishes
with
dryness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
summer
day
beer
i
dont
think
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
i
could
have
considering
it
is
the
middle
of
winter
though
this
is
a
well
made
beer
i
dont
know
that
it
can
stand
up
well
compared
to
other
cream
ales
would
order
again
in
a
heart
beat
loved
it
o
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
more
like
boddingtons
or
one
of
the
other
cream
ales
i
have
had
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
as
the
other
pelican
beers
were
pretty
good
d
i
wish
is
was
warmer
out
very
drinkable
and
would
be
great
on
a
nice
warm
day
of
relaxing
a
sessionable
brew
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
summer
this
brew
is
highly
drinkable
and
is
a
rare
example
of
a
fine
moment
in
american
beer
history
this
is
my
first
cream
ale
and
while
not
my
new
favorite
beer
it
certainly
lives
up
to
the
credentials
of
what
a
cream
ale
ought
to
be
a
solid
brew
by
a
solid
brewery
drinkability
sessionable
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
goes
great
with
a
day
on
the
beach
near
the
brew
pub
overall
this
is
refreshing
nice
ale
it
is
nothing
amazing
but
it
is
nicely
done
ale
worth
trying
if
you
want
a
nice
light
ale
that
has
flavor
d
an
allaround
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
good
flavors
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
did
go
very
well
with
pizza
i
had
tonite
for
those
who
like
input
on
beerfood
pairings
d
light
and
refreshing
brew
that
goes
down
really
clean
and
well
very
good
summer
session
beer
4

this
is
the
highest
drinkability
ever
it
is
refreshing
filling
tasty
and
smooth
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
light
with
virtually
no
weight
at
all
to
it
solid
and
crispclean
flavors
and
feeling
very
moderate
abv
all
of
the
makings
of
a
great
sessionable
beer
this
would
be
great
in
the
warmer
summer
months
d
low
abv
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
itd
get
boring
after
awhile
but
its
very
well
done
definitely
drinakble
and
enjoyable
was
vey
excited
to
hear
that
sams
in
il
was
stocking
these
bombers
overall
impression
a
great
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
doublethis
or
imperialthat
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding
or
in
this
case
the
glass
when
rating
to
style
i
cant
help
but
score
this
so
highly
thoroughly
enjoyable
right
now
even
better
come
summertime
taste
is
good
but
still
a
bit
grainy
and
a
dry
finish
that
then
hits
with
a
sticky
sweetness
overall
the
taste
did
not
live
up
to
the
great
aroma
expectations
are
decieving
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
malty
the
taste
was
crisp
clean
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
it
is
nicely
carbonated
and
is
a
great
session
beer
for
the
summer
to
wash
down
a
burger
and
fries
drinkability
is
pretty
high
at
least
as
much
as
a
good
clean
larger
would
be
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
good
enough
to
wash
down
some
pizza
while
i
watch
football
d
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
from
pelican
but
not
bad
at
all
appearance
is
gold
in
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
smell
is
faint
with
light
malts
and
citrus
taste
is
light
with
malt
honey
and
orange
peel
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
and
carbonation
that
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
not
bad
for
an
ale
that
comes
close
to
a
more
refreshing
lager
drinkability
this
was
delicious
an
incredibly
tasty
lager
or
cream
ale
if
i
wanted
a
lager
id
grab
for
this
cream
ales
arent
for
everyone
they
are
not
very
complex
but
should
be
appreciated
as
soothing
and
relaxing
definately
a
drinking
beer
and
one
that
should
be
appreciated
more
anyway
i
did
genuinely
enjoy
my
misidentified
pint
of
kiwanda
cream
ale
it
was
clean
and
refreshing
and
delivered
a
smooth
malty
body
with
minimal
bittering
i
sensed
my
pint
was
tired
as
it
showed
no
head
or
lace
and
the
honeygold
clear
brew
was
low
on
carbonation
but
the
big
bready
aroma
was
enticing
and
this
was
an
easy
beer
to
drink
on
a
summers
day
on
the
beach
fortunately
i
managed
to
persuade
my
wife
to
switch
pints
at
the
halfway
mark
and
ended
up
with
some
full
sail
ipa
i
tried
not
to
think
about
the
our
closest
offering
to
your
standard
bud
label
but
he
was
right
its
certainly
much
better
but
im
not
that
big
of
a
fan
maybe
it
needs
to
be
warmer
this
is
the
gateway
beer
for
these
guys
and
it
is
not
bad
but
like
many
cream
ales
tends
to
be
low
on
big

on

beer

it

a
palate
of
lightly
sweet

and
a
touch
of

hops
are

lightly
citric
a
bit
hoppier
than
some
cream

but
thats
because
most
are
bland

wannabes
still
the

are
hardly
noteworthy
fruity

dominates
the
flavor
with
traces
of

that
linger
some
lactic

in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
solid
cream
ale
or
light
golden
ale
as
i
think
of
it
since
its
not
really
creamy
but
the
style
does
almost
nothing
to
excite
me
the
buttery
flavors
dominate
whatever
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bite
there
could
be
i
guess
pelican
wanted
to
make
a
light
lageresque
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
big
beers
a
cream

is
a
valid
compromise
if
you
dont
have

id
rather
reach
for

cream
ale
is
not
a
complex
brew
drinkable
and
interesting
prior
to
this
review
i
would
have
told
you
there
was
no
cream
ale
in
the
world
worth
paying
4
35
330ml
bottle
for
and
to
be
clear
im
still
telling
you
that
that
kind
of
change
can
buy
you
much
better
beer
and
by
the
same
token
similar
beers
can
be
had
at
much
more
reasonable
prices
then
again
who
am
i
to
tell
you
how
to
spend
your
money
not
your
typical
ca
looks
and
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
smell
is
surprisingly
thin
and
pilsnerlike
the
mouth
feel
might
be
the
main
strength
of
this
beer
due
to
an
interesting
combination
of
malts
disappointing
batch
from
mikkeller
my
expectations
were
perhaps
too
high
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
yellow
color
ale
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
cereal
notes
is
quite
tame
taste
is
also
pretty
tame
with
light
cereal
notes
and
smooth
finish
body
is
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
for
style
but
really
nothing
that
good
to
write
home
about
final
grade

an
a
i
suppose
its
not
surprising
that
mikkeller
has
managed
to
produce
one
of
the
most
impressive
cream
ales
ive
ever
had
in
my
8
years
on
this
site
and
its
a
good
thing
because
at
this
price
point
id
be
kind
of
annoyed
if
they
hadnt
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
theoretically
anyway
because
six
of
these
would
cost
like
25
dollars
id
say
that
this
is
worth
a
try
but
a
repeat
purchase
is
probably
out
of
the
question

d
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
and
bitter
ale
that
has
a
creamy
texture
the
aroma
was
standout
highlight
for
me
but
not
something
i
would
likely
revisit
at
the
price
overall
a
palate
cleanser
bright
tart
and
refreshing
but
the
finish
strays
to
metal
and
stone
frankly
not
an
amazing
taste
despite
the
vibrancy
i
feel
like
the
constraints
and
guides
of
this
style
make
it
a
hard
outlet
to
create
world
class
beers
nevertheless
i
feel
mikkeller
did
a
jgood
job
in
spite
of
that
in
create
a
flavourful
and
zesty
cream
ale
but
the
tart
mustiness
and
tough
balance
of
flavour
make
it
a
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
regularly
it
is
still
one
of
the
better
cream
ales
i
can
remember
having
enjoy
113011
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
nice
smooth
dry
to
tart
great
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightish
body
very
tasty
and
goes
down
all
too
easily
not
sure
how
true
this
is
to
style
i
suspect
the
original
cream
ales
were
less
hoppy
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
well
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
one
finger
thin
white
head
with
nice
lacing
some
subtle
citrus
hops
initially
on
the
nose
but
that
quickly
gives
way
to
hints
of
grass
lemon
and
a
bit
of
funk
and
bread
the
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
at
first
for
a
cream
ale
a
lot
more
bitterness
than
i
had
expected
but
as
it
warms
the
malt
emerges
and
balances
it
out
nicely
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
with
hints
of
lemon
corn
and
grass
the
mouthfeel
is
not
creamy
at
all
and
is
borderline
fizzy
big
initial
bitterness
that
yields
to
a
crisp
dry
subtly
sweet
finish
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
cream
ale
but
this
is
not
what
i
remembered
but
then
again
mikkeller
never
follows
the
norm
and
thats
why
i
love
them

notes

some
big
yeast
wafting
from
the
glass
a
bit
bready
lightly
floral
unique
to
any
cream
ale
ive
come
across
taste
is
more
along
the
lines
of
what
i
had
expected
grainer
malt
notes
and
solid
but
restrained
hopping
still
moderately
juicy
and
citrusy
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
with
some
yeast
medium
feel
and
excellent
drinkability
wish
i
could
have
access
to
this
year
round
a
well
assembled
cream
ale
would
love
to
see
this
head
to
head
with
sweet
action
d
very

nice
cream
ale
good

the
beer
is

perhaps
for

im
being
a
little
hard
on
this
one
for
a
cream
ale
its
up
there
give
it
a
shot
if
you
find
it
i
really
like
this
beer
but
the
name

is
only
slightly
ironic
well
done
to

this

it

not
quite
what
i

it
would
be
but
pleasant
nonetheless
this
isnt

that
i
will
reach
for
again
anytime
soon
yeah
not
an
offensive
beer
some
good
flavours
a

offbalance

fairly
enjoyable
wow
i
was
so
underwhelmed

the
look

the

add

review
while
the
label
has
two
machine
guns
counterposed
one
emits
hops
and
the
other
barley
emitting
from
the
barrel
this
is
definately
not
a
brew
from
mikkeller
that
i
have
heard
of
before
but
looks
most
interesting
it
comes
a
creamy
coloured
label
with
two
machine
guns
on
the
front
label
and
it
is
a
collabaration
between
mikkeller
and

that

to
the

for
a

still
nice

has

full

smooth
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
very
smooth
pale
malts
and
some
bitter
hops
that
is
smoothed
out
right
at
the
finish
to
take
away
a
little
of
the
bitterness
but
its
still
there
which
i
likeoverall
a
nice
brew
that
would
buy
again
and
would
like
to
see
some
more
examples
of
this
style
but
i
have
had
better
brews
from
mikkeller
great
beer
really
enjoyed
it
great
color
very
up
front
dry
malty
flavor
rough
over
the
pallet
evenly
hopped
with
a
great
nose
m
not
bad
enjoyable
but
kind
of
watery
despite
all
my
description
of
how
its
enjoyable
unchallenging
and
thats
a
good
thing
in
the
proper
circumstances
i
personally
like
more
chewy
beers
but
the
mouthfeel
for
this
one
matched
its
taste
overall
not
really
too
great
but
there
is
nothing
abominable
or
awful
about
it
its
just
so
forgettable
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
although
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
it
overall
liked
this
much
more
the
second
time
around
very
smooth
overall
i
would
say
this
is
not
another
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
i
would
say
an
ok
party
beer
overall
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
but
i
would
prefer
something
else
leaves
a
somewhat
unpleasant
film
in
the
mouth
drinkability
yeah
not
so
much
if
you
see
a
bottle
of
this
coming
your
way
run
for
your
life
the
only
thing
this
beer
and
other
weston
beers
has
going
for
it
is
the
artwork
on
the
packaginglabels
unfortunately
its
not
enough
to
save
this
wretched
brew
this
is
a
rather
bland
ale
as
far
as
taste
it
smells
horrible
like
something
turning
bad
and
the
only
good
thing
is
that
it
has
a
great
mouthfeelvery
full
and
thick
i
feel
this
is
the
best
beer
that
weston
has
put
out
so
far
that
being
said
its
overall
an
average
ale
dcould
kill
6
of
these
and
be
very
happy
very
easy
to
drink
light
and
crisp
i
tried
hard
to
get
this
beer
and
i
mostly
drank
three
bottles
but
i
had
to
throw
out
the
other
three
worse
than
no
beer
at
all
feel
is
smooth
enough
without
major
flaws
theres
a
slight
astringency
present
though
easy
enough
to
drink
seems
better
suited
for
warm
weather
not
much
complexity
but
its
decent
im
wondering
if
this
is
a
new
batch
considering
all
the
earlier
bad
reviews
much
more
full
in
body
than
earlier
bottlings
of
this
same
beer
from
prior
tastings
at
retail
overcarbonated
too
much
easy
to
drink
a
decent
summer
beer
but
not
much
more
than
if
the
temp
is
lower
than
85
degrees
not
one
to
get
again
but
interesting
d
not
sure
about
this
one
i
wasnt
really
impressed
from
pour
to
finish
not
that
its
terrible
just
not
my
style
not
sure
its
a
good
example
either
i
dont
like
weston
brewing
companys
omalleys
irish
style
cream
ale
its
an
insult
to
omalley
to
the
irish
and
to
cream
ales
in
general
good
thing
distribution
is
limited
i
very
rarely
get
this
down
on
a
beer
i
was
even
going
to
give
it
a
second
shot
and
purchase
a
new
six
pack
of
the
beer
thinking
maybe
something
goofy
had
happened
during
the
shipping
proces
or
at
the
market
where
i
picked
up
that
tainted
the
beer
in
conversation
with
my
buddy
a
couple
days
after
i
had
tried
this
beer
he
was
telling
me
about
a
new
beer
he
had
picked
up
at
the
package
store
which
he
thought
was
awful
it
turned
out
to
be
this
very
same
beer
not
repulsive
but
a
waste
too
bad
i
would
have
loved
to
continue
buying
from
a
local
brewery
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
dominates
a
small
presence
of
peet
and
a
small
bitter
a
bitter
yet
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
malty
and
sweet
easy
to
drink
and
mellow
flavors
are
light
but
effective
this
beers
pours
a
pale
strawcolored
yellow
with
a
white
monstrous
head
aroma
is
very
light
but
there
is
a
tart
sweetness
to
it
that
i
can
detect
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
hint
of
apple
but
not
at
all
tart
i
think
this
is
what
makes
this
beer
appealing
and
drinkable
there
is
some
creaminess
to
the
body
though
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
cream
ale
style
i
cant
make
any
comparisons
this
one
is
not
a
beer
that
id
go
out
and
seek
i
did
find
this
beer
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
d
an
odd
beer
even
for
a
cream
ale
light
bodied
creamy
easily
drinkable
and
fairly
refreshing
had
on
tap
at
the
iliki
cafe
served
in
a
pint
glass
clear
yellow
colot
not
really
that
impressive
massive
and
thick
head
with
a
consistancy
of
whipped
cream
points
lost
for
color
are
earned
back
with
the
head
it
glues
itself
to
the
glass
leaving
solid
stripes
with
each
sip
smell
is
not
very
noticable
slightly
lemony
and
biscuity
taste
is
also
very
light
but
picks
up
a
bit
more
grassy
notes
mouthfeel
is
of
course
very
creamy
in
fact
for
the
fist
half
of
it
its
like
eating
whipped
cream
this
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
even
if
there
sint
much
substance
behind
it
definately
a
session
beer
this
is
the
only
offering
from
the
weston
brewing
co
served
only
in
omalleys
irish
pub
in
weston
mo
as
of
today
the
beer
is
overall
unimpressive
served
on
nitro
the
carbonation
masks
the
taste
for
the
most
part
and
the
aroma
in
total
the
flavor
is
predominately
sweet
malts
and
some
light
grains
all
of
the
taste
is
found
in
the
frontend
of
the
beer
there
is
no
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
most
of
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
nitro
not
offensive
at
all
and
apparently
they
serve
a
bunch
of
it
but
most
bas
will
not
be
impressed
i
cant
drink
this
without
saying
that
someone
who
doesnt
like
this
beer
doesnt
like
cream
ales
have
always
been
an
average
cream
ale
fan
however
the
empire
version
with
nitro
on
tap
was
surprising
only
diff
i
gave
it
a
higher
rating
perhaps
the
best
cream
ale
i
have
encountered
on
the
nitro
tap
at
blue
tusk
it
pours
a
cascading
deep
honey
color
with
a
lavish
white
head
as
thick
as
they
come
perfect
ring
lacing
behind
in
my
schooner
after
every
sip
the
nose
is
rather
subtle
a
blend
of
malts
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
and
a
prominent
english
smelling
ale
yeast
i
feel
this
before
i
taste
it
smooth
and
refined
clean
and
bright
exceptional
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
just
a
peg
less
exciting
a
straightforward
light
malt
beer
very
fresh
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
a
beer
slight
sweetness
as
it
finishes
but
a
mute
bready
swallow
is
what
is
best
describes
this
brew
maybe
empires
best
offering
id
like
to
see
more
of
the
cream
ale
style
around
also
the
nitro
tap
is
the
absolutely
perfect
format
for
a
beer
like
this
great
all
year
round
one
of
my
new
favorite
syracuse
sessions
overall
if
only
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
mouthfeel
honestly
this
one
is
still
worth
trying
just
for
the
smooth
feeling
it
gives
but
alas
i
cant
get
past
that
weird
soapy
flavor
for
the
record
no
the
glass
was
not
dirty
with
soap
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
muggy
summer
day
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
cream
ale
nice
citrus
and
fruit
in
the
nose
and
very
malty
taste
with
an
amazing
mouthfeel
would
have
it
again
o
very
easy
drinker
could
pass
for
a
good
session
beer
nice
for
the
style
a
bit
more
flavor
would
have
brought
it
home
worth
a
try
o
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
is
really
creamy
and
it
goes
down
quite
easily
i
think
it
being
nitrotapped
really
enhanced
the
creaminess
it
isnt
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
very
sessionable
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
but
not
really
what
i
like
if
you
like
cream
ales
or
nitro
beers
you
should
try
it
empire
made
a
pretty
good
cream
ale
with
this
one
it
certainly
did
not
take
long
to
get
through
notes
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
american
cream
ale
to
me
where
something
like
genesee
cream
ale
falls
short
this
brew
covers
mouthfeel
then
flavor
and
brewing
them
well
i
wouldnt
have
expected
that
i
could
feel
this
way
about
a
cream
ale
smells
like
cream
soda
doesnt
taste
like
one
though
also
doesnt
taste
like
a
cider
kind
of
bland
and
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
its
a
cream
ale
with
apple
juice
and
thats
what
it
is
on
tap
pours
with
a
small
head
great
blend
between
cider
and
cream
ale
light
body
reminds
me
of
redds
sweet
caramel
apple
aroma
pretty
good
tasting
kind
of
tastes
like
spotted
cow
with
apples
slight
banana
flavors
as
well
not
up
there
with
new
glarus
apple
ale
but
would
drink
again
a
tasty
little
ale
that
i
had
higher
hopes
for
with
that
said
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
was
served
at
a
party
but
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
for
myself
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
sixpack
cream
ale
sounded
pleasant
although
i
have
scarcely
had
one
before
and
being
huge
fan
of
a
good
cider
i
figured
this
would
be
a
homerun
the
flavor
was
just
offputting
for
my
taste
the
applecider
was
overly
sweet
and
completely
unbalanced
with
the
ale
which
left
a
strange
aftertaste
i
ended
up
giving
4
of
the
6
bottles
to
friends
to
try
and
they
had
similar
feelings
however
we
agreed
this
would
be
a
great
ingredient
for
beerbread
not
bad
at
all
i
like
the
apple
upfront
and
the
malt
back
o
i
was
looking
for
ng
apple
ale
when
i
came
across
this
one
at
a
store
in
madison
the
sales
person
advised
me
this
was
the
superior
beer
im
going
to
have
to
disagree
and
while
ill
readily
admit
im
generally
a
critic
of
the
cream
ale
style
ill
also
say
this
beer
isnt
going
to
prove
me
wrong
either
drinkable
but
not
that
id
want
to
o
i
can
appreciate
what
the
brewer
is
going
for
here
but
as
far
as
apple
beers
are
concerned
i
guess
i
prefer
the
all
in
approach
like
new
glaruss
apple
ale
this
one
has
some
nice
cream
ale
qualities
but
the
apple
cider
incorporated
into
the
process
just
doesnt
work
for
me
i
found
it
pretty
interesting
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
i
was
hoping
for
even
so
it
was
worth
a
try
cheers
it
really
does
come
across
as
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
but
be
aware
before
you
consume
and
you
wont
get
something
you
werent
expecting
o
a
fun
beer
to
drink
to
change
things
up
sour
apples
taste
great
and
they
go
well
with
beer
top
to
bottom
not
the
most
impressive
beer
ive
ever
had
but
still
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
a
great
cream
ale
i
cant
help
but
think
of
spotted
cow
when
i
drink
this
it
is
literally
like
an
apple
flavored
spotted
cow
very
good
would
definitely
buy
again
moderate
to
low
carbonation
creamy
overall
a
rather
disappointing
beer
a
cool
concept
but
poorly
executed
pretty
bad
taste
with
a
worse
aftertaste
maybe
this
would
be
better
fresh
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
that
doesnt
really
stick
around
very
long
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
nice
light
apple
cider
like
aroma
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
but
it
just
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
apple
punch
to
it
the
mouthfeel
has
a
thin
body
lightly
carbonated
and
kind
of
watery
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
could
be
pretty
awesome
if
furthermore
could
just
kick
it
up
a
notch
in
the
flavors
i
would
drink
it
again
though
because
i
really
like
apple
ales
overall
the
flavor
will
be
off
putting
to
some
of
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
dry
ciders
or
with
those
who
dont
like
their
beers
with
fruity
flavoring
aside
from
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
cream
ale
it
drinks
like
a
cream
ale
should
beer
is
light
in
body
and
really
unimpressive
really
unimpressive
grainy
at
the
finish
light
and
appley
up
front
with
a
creaminess
to
the
whole
thing
this
was
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
this
is
also
a
style
i
dont
really
like
ive
had
much
better
cream
ales
though
this
was
a
big
disappointment
o
would
definitley
drink
this
one
again
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
amberyorange
color
actually
kind
of
reminiscent
of
a
lighter
apple
juice
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
but
some
little
carbonation
bubbles
here
and
there
didnt
get
too
much
from
the
aroma
possibly
because
i
was
mainly
smelling
the
cleaning
solution
of
the
glass
unless
that
actually
was
the
beer
but
sticking
my
nose
in
a
little
further
i
detected
just
a
bit
of
apple
sweetness
surely
more
juicelike
than
ciderlike
taste
was
moderately
decent
with
light
apples
sugar
and
pale
malts
i
didnt
really
get
much
of
a
cream
ale
feel
from
it
honestly
pretty
light
in
the
mouth
and
just
a
bit
filmy
decent
overall
and
fairly
drinkable
but
a
bit
bland
and
watery
for
me
my
aggressive
pour
netted
me
twoplus
fingers
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
there
was
no
need
to
lean
in
for
a
sniff
the
nose
was
like
having
bitten
into
a
red
delicious
color
was
a
beautiful
goldenamber
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
crisp
apple
tartness
on
the
tongue
the
label
read
cream
ale
brewed
with
apple
cider
but
the
apple
flavor
was
dominant
finish
was
crisp
and
dry
but
the
effervescence
lent
it
a
quality
that
ordinary
hard
cider
seems
to
lack
i
am
betting
that
the
abv
is
relatively
low
making
it
perfect
for
a
slow
autumn
afternoon
pours
a
clean
orangeish
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
like
a
mellow
apple
cider
in
the
taste
mellow
apple
cider
but
not
as
acidic
as
cider
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
cider
like
aftertaste
more
a
cider
than
a
beer
drinkability
solid
all
around
hybrid
style
that
i
hope
to
see
more
of
i
like
cider
and
a
decent
mass
produced
cream
ale
blend
these
two
styles
together
and
you
have
a
nice
mix
of
the
two
keep
it
going
solid
quality
overall
good
experience
d
this
and
the
new
glarus
apple
ale
wereare
pretty
interesting
i
liked
it
but
at
some
points
i
was
thinking
i
would
rather
just
have
a
cider
pours
a
golden
apple
juice
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
no
real
lacing
smells
like
apples
and
some
little
cream
beer
tastes
like
apple
cider
with
some
mild
cream
ale
mixed
in
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
non
beer
drinkers
will
like
it
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
collared
head
it
honestly
looks
like
apple
juice
sweet
apple
cider
aroma
in
the
nose
with
little
else
maybe
some
slight
spice
sweet
apple
flavor
upfront
wtih
some
tartness
some
cherry
flavors
as
well
this
beer
is
pretty
sweet
but
its
decent
for
a
fruit
beer
having
had
new
glarus
unplugged
apple
ale
today
i
would
say
this
is
an
ok
substitute
but
not
as
good
as
teh
ng
mediumlight
mouthfeel
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
sheets
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
do
not
remember
many
cream
ales
looking
as
good
as
this
one
aroma
is
a
combination
of
green
apples
and
cereal
malt
the
apple
juice
added
something
to
this
beer
it
is
well
represented
in
the
flavor
as
well
adds
an
interesting
tart
green
apple
flavor
that
compliments
the
otherwise
bland
and
uninteresting
malt
hop
bitterness
is
nonexistant
the
beer
may
be
just
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
the
style
otherwise
the
body
is
good
a
little
bit
more
body
than
what
is
typically
a
lighter
beer
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
especially
considering
the
high
abv
but
a
cream
ale
that
is
a
little
bit
more
interesting
than
most
d
a
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
light
and
has
a
good
flavor
but
really
how
much
apple
beer
can
a
person
take
for
me
i
am
only
going
to
have
one
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
slight
head
which
gives
way
to
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
fall
apples
and
a
hint
of
spices
not
a
hop
aroma
or
malt
aroma
around
though
but
the
smell
is
pleasant
the
taste
is
of
apple
cider
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
fall
spices
its
a
nice
flavor
no
beer
flavor
but
a
nice
mellow
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
i
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
a
very
easy
drink
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
great
beer
for
sitting
outside
in
slightly
chilly
weather
the
taste
is
of
apple
cider
but
i
dont
think
that
is
a
bad
thing
either
i
would
tell
anyone
not
to
purchase
this
it
really
isnt
that
good
maybe
girls
at
a
high
school
party
would
like
it
couldnt
see
myself
getting
this
again
apple
flavors
overwhelm
d
well
i
have
to
take
in
the
fact
that
it
was
a
high
price
on
the
mix
and
match
section
red
dot
so
a
sixer
will
be
around
1314
dollars
ouch
if
i
do
see
it
for
the
price
of
lancasters
beers
1011
dollars
i
would
pick
up
a
sixer
overall
a
refreshing
and
damn
6
2
really
smooth
for
the
abv
liked
it
d
this
beer
falls
short
on
all
accounts
it
needs
more
of
everything
just
onedimensional
and
boring
for
a
beer
that
has
the
potential
to
be
so
much
more
d
drinkable
enough
but
the
preponderance
of
apple
doesnt
make
me
want
to
have
another
one
there
isnt
a
lot
of
beer
to
be
had
in
fallen
apple
but
its
really
not
bad
it
is
different
enough
to
warrant
a
look
especially
if
you
like
appleflavored
drinks
purchased
from
blue
max
liquors
in
burnsville
mn
pours
a
clear
light
coppery
orange
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
falls
to
a
cap
aroma
is
of
clean
malt
and
faint
apple
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
smooth
malt
flavors
lead
to
just
a
hint
of
apple
in
the
finish
with
no
detectable
bitterness
very
refreshing
i
had
expected
this
to
be
overly
apple
flavored
and
syrupy
but
it
had
great
drinkability
and
gives
a
new
take
on
a
light
cream
ale
well
done
furthermore
a
decent
drinkable
ale
as
sessionable
as
any
6
2
ale
could
be
im
a
fan
of
apples
and
it
works
here
just
needs
some
slight
cleaning
up
if
it
didnt
have
the
musty
aroma
and
lesser
hints
of
it
in
the
taste
i
would
be
scoring
it
higher
worth
a
try
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
next
year
dhmmmi
thoughtwas
hoping
this
would
be
a
lot
better
than
what
is
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
this
is
more
of
a
boring
cream
ale
with
apple
not
an
apple
beer
i
think
i
will
use
the
rest
of
my
bottles
to
cook
pork
loins
in
overall
not
my
thing
but
my
girlfriend
loves
this
stuff
i
would
say
its
drinkable
only
since
its
not
real
strong
on
character
a
drinkable
beer
the
apple
doesnt
seem
to
really
fit
in
the
best
though
its
a
nice
attempt
but
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
d
not
something
i
will
pick
up
again
and
frankly
i
am
glad
i
just
grabbed
a
single
bottle
of
this
this
beer
is
probably
more
popular
with
casual
beer
drinkers
than
most
people
on
this
site
because
of
the
apples
and
cream
finish
regardless
some
improvements
are
needed
before
i
would
grab
this
beer
over
the
other
furthermore
offerings
light
bodied
and
moderate
carbonation
i
was
hoping
furthermore
would
crank
out
a
good
apple
ale
but
truthfully
it
felt
a
bit
muddled
and
while
the
apple
flavors
are
there
they
are
unrefined
and
harsh
on
that
note
i
find
most
apple
ales
to
be
pretty
substandard
so
that
is
no
surprise
to
me
you
want
a
fruit
beer
you
go
to
new
glarus
brewing
co
and
their
apple
ale
was
sublime
furthermore
brews
some
pretty
solid
craft
beer
that
has
impressed
me
more
often
than
not
fatty
boombalatty
is
da
bomb
fallen
apple
is
one
of
their
worst
efforts
and
needs
a
pretty
thorough
overhaul
before
id
consider
buying
it
again
new
glarus
unplugged
apple
ale
was
apple
beer
done
right
good
to
try
but
no
reason
to
get
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
a
fizzy
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
and
ripe
apples
the
taste
is
like
a
green
jolly
rancher
not
something
i
ever
wanted
to
taste
in
a
beer
it
get
stronger
in
the
finish
and
i
find
myself
fighting
it
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
i
cannot
get
past
this
beers
taste
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
now
maybe
that
was
an
expected
taste
or
like
i
said
it
was
a
bad
batch
i
understand
that
some
people
like
the
bittervinegar
taste
but
and
this
is
coming
from
a
cider
beer
fan
it
was
not
for
me
tastes
like
i
dont
know
really
is
this
supposed
to
be
a
beer
or
a
cider
checked
the
poster
up
across
the
bar
and
it
said
it
was
a
cream
ale
with
apple
added
to
it
so
i
guess
theres
that
but
if
you
had
told
me
it
was
a
cider
i
would
have
believed
you
unlike
other
apple
fruit
beers
like
ephemere
where
the
apple
tartness
is
balanced
against
the
spiciness
of
a
malt
or
yeast
profile
here
all
we
got
to
balance
some
surprisingly
tart
green
apples
is
a
tame
cream
ale
malt
profile
the
result
is
a
beer
thats
not
bad
tasting
really
but
its
a
little
too
bland
and
a
little
too
tart
worth
checking
out
albeit
nowhere
near
as
good
as
new
glarus
apple
as
that
is
an
apple
beer
this
is
a
beer
with
apple
d
i
decided
that
if
you
come
at
this
from
the
beer
angle
youll
probably
be
disappointed
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
hard
cider
this
is
great
it
has
a
very
fresh
cider
feel
with
just
enough
creaminess
from
the
beer
to
give
it
a
great
balance
d
you
could
drink
alot
of
these
theres
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
great
either
worth
trying
fallen
apple
pours
a
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
tight
light
khaki
colored
head
that
remained
throughout
consumption
the
aroma
consists
of
sweet
green
apples
the
malt
reminded
me
of
an
apple
kringle
crust
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
effervescent
this
is
a
very
dry
apple
ale
savory
and
almost
lending
itself
as
a
sipper
to
enjoy
and
contemplate
the
flavors
of
the
beer
its
light
and
crisp
almost
brutlike
apple
sweetness
is
combined
with
a
light
maltiness
to
find
and
enjoyable
autumn
ale
just
not
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
seemed
to
come
together
for
this
beer
i
am
disappointed
but
if
you
cant
get
enough
apple
juice
here
is
your
beer
of
choice
i
really
like
that
furthermore
is
doing
something
different
with
their
beers
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
that
not
a
nail
biter
but
interesting
special
thanks
to
asmokingoat
for
this
one
as
part
of
the
local
beer
and
glass
bif
drinkablility
is
good
this
is
little
more
than
apple
jiuce
with
a
bit
of
malt
this
works
well
but
does
not
lend
well
to
a
beer
d
too
much
corn
too
little
apple
for
my
tastes
if
you
are
going
to
go
fruity
go
over
the
top
like
belgian
red
this
was
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
go
for
again
it
was
hard
to
realy
get
into
this
one
if
you
have
friends
that
want
beer
but
normally
drink
wine
coolers
or
the
hard
lemonades
steer
them
towards
this
taste
has
a
bit
of
apple
tartness
a
flash
of
green
jolly
rancher
sweetness
before
the
corn
and
pale
malt
take
over
the
middle
and
aftertaste
feel
is
slightly
creamy
but
it
looks
filtered
without
much
yeast
to
give
it
added
body
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
long
cornymalty
aftertaste
one
bottle
was
manageable
but
this
wont
be
a
repeat
for
me
1
99
from
rileys
madison
d
this
beer
has
some
bright
fresh
apple
flavor
with
some
nice
cream
ale
qualities
flavors
are
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
sweet
and
simple
i
didnt
have
a
bad
experience
drinking
this
but
its
not
something
i
would
recomend
a
friend
to
spend
money
on
the
malt
body
was
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
but
did
like
the
spicey
notes
that
came
with
the
apple
flavor
id
weakly
recommend
it
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
single
of
this
only
1
49
down
the
drain
i
wasnt
really
paying
attention
with
this
beer
its
just
everywhere
i
turn
a
late
fall
release
and
when
my
wife
made
a
comment
about
it
i
decided
to
get
a
single
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
a
localized
woodchuck
version
of
cider
ale
turns
out
this
is
just
a
beer
with
apple
tendancies
cream
ale
is
a
decent
style
category
i
was
initially
disappointed
when
trying
this
because
i
was
geared
up
for
some
apple
cider
after
readjusting
my
expectations
i
was
still
disappointed
because
the
apple
flavor
isnt
very
forthcoming
very
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
drinkability
fine
drinkabilityoverall
another
solid
if
not
underwhelming
beer
from
furthermore
the
apple
is
present
but
restrained
as
was
the
pepper
in
their
knot
stock
i
like
what
theyre
trying
to
do
i
just
feel
all
of
their
beers
are
too
safe
its
hard
to
find
shelf
space
around
here
if
youre
not
going
to
do
something
to
garner
interest
best
of
luck
to
them
however
overall
pretty
much
an
above
average
beer
its
representative
of
the
style
but
its
a
style
thats
a
little
close
to
aal
for
me
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
this
type
of
beer
but
i
think
many
bas
would
probably
rather
pass
a
well
made
and
downright
slammable
cream
ale
from
ninkasi
clear
blonde
and
relatively
heady
about
an
inch
of
sudsy
white
foam
with
fine
retention
some
sweetness
to
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
a
bigger
grain
bill
than
so
many
of
the
lower
budget
creams
on
the
market
i
almost
taste
some
rice
in
this
or
some
other
rather
bland
starch
it
has
body
out
of
seemingly
nowhere
but
still
drinks
easy
with
bright
carbonation
and
a
cleaner
cereal
finish
my
only
real
critique
here
is
the
way
my
palate
stays
coated
after
the
swallow
some
thin
film
seems
to
cover
my
tongue
and
teeth
not
bad
tasting
or
anything
just
an
odd
feeling
for
such
a
light
style
of
beer
not
my
favorite
ninkasi
brew
so
far
but
a
more
than
serviceable
cream
ale
i
am
a
big
proponent
of
the
style
and
reckon
we
need
quite
a
few
more
available

the

down
smell

grain
and
some
sugary

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
grassy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
nice
overall
balance
with
a
good
malt
profile
the
body
was
the
expected
full
and
smooth
drinkability
was
very
nice
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
certainly
worth
your
time
if
you
ever
see
it

make
a
superior
adjunct
style
beer
nuptiale
is
better
than
i
expected
flavorful
yet
drinkable
its
a
decent
cream

taste
is
nice
fullbodied
creamy
toasty
grain
bread
apple
with
a
grassypeppery
bitterness
that
is
light
but
firm
it
is
great
a
firm
fullbodied
cream
ale
character
with
a
lot
of
flavour
and
wellrounded
with
a
hint
of
complexity
it
is
lightly
sweet
in
a
typical
cream
ale
way
but
has
a
light
hoppy
character
and
bitterness
to
back
it
up
and
round
it
out
its
great
with
food
and
overall
excellent
this
beer
is
really
hard
to
just
sip
it
really
invites
big
gulps
ive
never
had
a
cream
ale
before
and
i
must
guess
that
this
one
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
creamy
mouthfeel
as
promised
but
its
not
heavy
or
cloying
very
drinkable
a
solid
light
crisp
cream
ale
deftly
balanced
and
very
tasty
overall
i
like
this
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
memorable
just
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
d
very
refreshing
enjoyable
flavor
worth
drinking
overall
good
beer
for
a
warm
day
there
is
a
little
more
hop
flavor
in
this
one
compared
to
other
cream
ales
i
have
had
but
also
a
little
thinner
3
55
o
an
odd
flavor
is
enough
for
me
to
pass
on
this
one
next
time
overall
a
good
beer
fits
the
style
pretty
well
would
be
quite
nice
on
nitro
solid
summer
beer
quite
thirst
quenching
o
i
love
ninkasi
and
i
love
most
of
what
they
make
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
3

poured
somewhat
aggressively
into
my
standard
pint
glass
and
i
get
a
pretty
big
two
finger
head
the
head
is
completely
white
with
mostly
small
bubbles
some
big
ones
i
cant
tell
if
the
bubbles
look
creamy
or
soapy
prolly
more
on
the
creamy
side
though
for
sure
has
a
pillowy
look
to
it
as
well
though
the
head
is
giving
great
lacing
all
the
way
throughout
the
glass
frankly
im
impressed
with
how
long
this
head
is
sticking
around
i
doubt
it
will
be
here
forever
but
i
dont
really
expect
that
from
any
beer
but
a
nitro
beer
overall
its
hanging
in
here
pretty
well
the
body
is
just
slightly
darker
than
a
lager
slightly
lighter
than
a
pale
ale
nice
mix
between
the
two
somewhat
transparent
but
its
cold
enough
in
the
glass
and
slightly
dark
enough
that
i
cant
see
too
much
on
the
other
side
the
carbonation
looks
like
it
might
be
a
little
high
be
its
pretty
close
to
perfect
overall
this
beer
looks
really
really
nice
im
excited
the
smell
is
a
little
weird
for
me
on
one
hand
it
smells
creamy
smooth
and
tasty
but
on
the
other
hand
it
has
a
lemon
smell
that
almost
reminds
me
of
the
blue
moon
spring
seasonal
which
was
not
good
at
all
it
also
has
a
hint
of
those
kind
of
adjuncts
the
more
i
smell
this
beer
the
more
i
just
want
to
give
it
a
3
this
beer
barely
is
making
a
3
5
on
smell
not
too
impressed
with
the
smell
overall
not
a
bad
taste
though
on
this
beer
first
you
get
that
lemon
taste
that
i
was
talking
about
but
after
a
few
sips
it
just
blends
right
in
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
then
there
is
a
nice
nice
creamy
taste
to
this
beer
maybe
a
tiny
hop
bite
and
a
noticeable
but
not
at
all
overpowering
malt
note
the
balance
on
this
beer
is
done
very
well
im
really
impressed
with
the
malts
just
the
right
amount
not
too
much
but
not
too
little
perhaps
some
hidden
flavors
in
here
as
well
maybe
vanilla
vanilla
and
cream
do
go
together
well
so
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
its
not
the
most
amazing
beer
of
all
time
but
its
really
good
and
its
somewhat
unique
i
havent
had
too
many
cream
ales
but
from
what
i
can
remember
this
is
a
little
different
from
the
rest
the
taste
is
really
growing
on
me
it
just
keeps
getting
tastier
i
dont
think
its
going
to
get
much
higher
than
a
4
just
because
it
does
have
a
tiny
tiny
tiny
cheap
beer
taste
but
i
wont
count
the
possibility
out
overall
a
really
nice
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
cream
ale
perfect
carbonation
perfect
girth
on
the
body
excellent
drinkability
is
phenomenal
it
goes
down
super
easy
its
light
creamy
refreshing
and
best
of
all
tasty
overall
i
really
good
beer
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
this
good
when
i
smelled
it
but
it
really
came
through
overall
this
is
a
very
grainy
full
flavored
pale
ale
which
is
fantastic
but
i
have
to
judge
this
beer
as
its
name
and
style
represents
this
would
be
an
a
grade
pale
if
it
were
just
so
d
very
sessionable
but
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
still
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
prefer
more
flavorful
brews
but
this
is
worth
a
try
prefer
it
very
cold
it
helps
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
the
kick
must
end
up
coming
from
the
bourbon
barrels
possibly
its
a
good
all
night
beer
if
you
like
very
sweet
very
meh
and
had
a
weird
taste
on
teh
finish
it
was
ok
but
the
smoke
flavor
didnt
come
through
much
and
just
kind
of
made
this
one
taste
a
little
strange
good
stuff
id
have
another
of
these
smells
an
tastes
like
an
old
root
beer
that
was
left
in
a
hot
truck
during
the
summer
and
then
iced
down
wasnt
impressed
and
took
a
lot
to
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
my
dog
wouldnt
even
drink
it
not
good
dont
waste
your
money
i
love
root
beer
and
i
thought
i
would
try
it
out
i
thought
how
bad
could
hard
root
beer
be
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
have
dumped
two
down
the
sink
before
i
was
halfway
through
because
it
tastes
exactly
like
cough
medicine
dangerously
great
tasting
beer
at
5
and
testing
just
like
root
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
slight
root
beer
taste
but
has
a
wired
sour
taste
it
truly
tastes
like
root
beer
these
are
very
drinkable
i
drank
sprecher
regular
root
beer
10
years
ago
when
it
was
available
at
costco
down
here
in
tennessee
finding
this
alcoholic
version
is
a
real
treat
since
i
started
getting
back
into
root
beers
i
had
seen
this
on
the
shelf
numerous
times
but
always
passed
on
it
i
then
recevied
a
not
your
fathers
rootbeer
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
really
enjoyed
it
that
experience
prompted
me
to
give
this
one
a
try
and
i
am
glad
i
did
its
not
quite
as
good
as
not
your
fathers
but
pretty
close
tastes
just
like
root
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
could
have
used
some
more
head
on
it
for
sure
i
really
liked
it
had
a
real
natural
rootwood
refreshing
taste
a
little
thin
in
feel
and
couldnt
tell
there
was
alcohol
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
with
all
the
rave
for
not
your
fathers
root
beer
i
decided
id
give
this
one
a
go
lo
and
behold
tastes
just
like
root
beer
although
a
little
too
sweet
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
beer
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
beer
cannot
rave
about
it
enough
i
will
be
purchasing
more
for
sure
looks
and
smells
nice
tastes
like
someone
combined
crappy
beer
and
aw
never
again
tastes
like
root
beer
at
first
then
odd
after
taste
not
a
complex
of
traditional
tasting
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
tastes
like
a
damn
good
root
beer
which
i
would
think
was
the
goal
so
a
very
well
done
beer
in
that
regard
tastes
like
root
beer
but
it
has
an
odd
flavor
component
to
it
which
brings
it
rating
down
thought
this
would
be
a
twofer
hints
of
both
flavors
ultimately
disappointing
and
a
bit
strange
not
sure
what
to
do
with
the
last
three
bottles
the
taste
is
tangy
and
sweet
with
light
woody
root
combo
of
tastes
with
mild
alcohol
coming
through
as
it
finishes
with
a
slight
cinnamonspice
woodiness
with
a
yeastiness
that
detracts
but
pretty
good
considering
it
sounds
like
it
could
come
off
as
a
weak
root
beer
schnapps
malternative
i
consider
this
good
for
what
it
is
but
would
not
revisit
itnot
terrible
tastes
less
like
a
beer
more
like
spiked
root
beer
just
what
the
world
needs
a
5
abv
soda
i
love
it
with
a
dollop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
im
confused
is
this
beer
im
not
being
sarcastic
either
way
this
tastes
like
root
beer
thats
it
got
some
alcohol
noticeable
but
hardly
this
tastes
100
like
root
beer
easy
to
drink
and
not
bad
either
but
i
would
never
drink
this
if
i
wanted
a
beer
this
is
soda
an
aggressive
pour
produced
half
a
mug
of
tan
head
for
the
most
part
it
looks
and
smells
like
root
beer
the
smell
is
a
little
off
the
taste
is
similar
to
root
beer
it
starts
out
good
but
has
a
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
it
seems
undercarbonated
and
thin
overall
its
not
a
bad
attempt
at
hard
root
beer
i
would
try
it
again
and
may
try
a
float
with
it
its
pretty
much
a
malty
root
beer
soda
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
if
youre
looking
for
something
beyond
that
you
might
want
to
look
elsewhere
its
not
one
of
the
best
flavored
ales
ive
had
yet
the
root
beermalt
combo
was
enough
for
me
to
make
it
worth
the
cost
of
the
six
pack
sore
hers
root
beer
is
my
favorite
and
so
i
thought
would
try
the
hard
version
boy
was
this
a
mistake
what
good
smell
but
an
awful
taste
took
my
glass
of
it
and
poor
it
out
next
to
patio
was
very
disappointed
as
i
love
their
beers
and
pop
i
will
say
you
should
give
it
a
try
and
if
you
dump
it
youre
out
1
50
which
we
waste
more
on
other
things
we
try
5
minutes
laterupdate
yeah
this
is
definitely
making
me
feel
really
sick
i
have
to
throw
this
down
the
drain
there
is
something
wrong
in
this
something
seriously
wrong
somebody
get
me
a
twelve
pack
this
is
outstanding
overall
this
is
a
decent
cream
ale
easy
to
drink
but
kind
of
boring
probably
my
least
favorite
crow
peak
beer
canyon
cream
ale
pours
a
bright
straw
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
there
is
an
aroma
similar
to
garbage
that
has
been
sitting
in
the
hot
sun
for
a
while
the
taste
however
is
crisp
and
has
a
mellow
golden
malty
undertone
the
taste
is
watery
but
still
some
flavors
can
be
picked
out
overall
it
tastes
good
but
its
a
bit
weak
and
boring
overall
pleasant
surprise
after
a
12
hour
drive
from
jackson
wyoming
it
was
much
needed
and
i
wish
id
bought
more
canyon
cream
ale
is
a
true
summertime
beer
this
is
not
a
big
beer
by
any
means
it
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
hint
of
honey
the
taste
is
magnificent
especially
on
those
hot
summer
sodak
days
this
is
a
crow
peak
regular
one
of
the
few
beers
they
can
shared
this
gem
with
the
rb
crew
recently
the
beer
is
clear
and
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
brings
malt
yeast
corn
the
flavor
follows
suit
corn
and
malt
light
bodied
with
lingering
adjunct
flavors
eh
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
overall
interesting
tasty
very
drinkable
o
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
pretty
nice
lawnmower
beer
id
probably
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
grainier
and
drier
but
not
bad
nevertheless
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
a
buddy
brought
this
back
from
his
summer
trip
out
to
sd
the
beer
poured
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
head
initially
then
it
dissappeared
and
did
not
notice
any
lacing
the
smell
had
some
honey
and
mild
citrus
taste
was
ok
malt
and
a
little
citrus
mouthfeel
had
a
light
body
and
mild
carbonation
worth
a
try
sure
would
i
get
it
again
no
thanks
for
the
can
crow
peak
any
craft
beer
in
a
can
i
will
try
i
get
tired
of
taking
glass
to
recycle
aluminum
is
curb
side
and
i
can
store
more
in
the
beer
fridge
and
take
to
the
pool
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
wife
who
steers
clean
of
any
ipa
disappointed
ive
tried
the
11th
hour
ipa
and
pileodirt
porter
as
well
those
two
on
tap
and
in
can
im
about
to
head
out
to
school
in
rapids
city
so
i
plan
to
return
if
i
have
a
disappointing
outing
in
person
again
i
plan
to
address
this
with
the
bar
tender
hell
i
might
even
bring
some
beer
with
me
to
prove
a
point
o
really
a
nice
representation
for
the
style
i
really
only
have
some
homebrewed
versions
and
spotted
cow
for
comparison
this
is
right
up
there
with
spotted
cow
this
was
great
on
a
95
degree
day
d
this
is
what
craft
beers
answer
to
light
beers
should
be
feel
thin
with
decent
carbonation
o
very
nice
lighter
beer
to
quote
forest
gump
i
could
drink
about
a
million
and
a
half
of
these
nice
alternative
to
an
american
lager
something
for
those
who
arent
fans
of
bitter
brews
an
option
for
the
times
you
want
to
drink
a
lighter
ale
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
although
it
doesnt
quite
match
the
specifications
for
a
mainstream
cream
ale
mainly
clarity
some
aromatics
its
quite
a
nice
beer
in
its
own
right
and
i
dont
know
any
craft
brew
drinkers
who
are
too
into
clarity
quaffable
might
be
a
good
word
to
use
to
describe
it
hazy
golden
in
color
aroma
hints
of
yeast
bread
and
a
flour
tortilla
wheaty
bready
not
an
awful
beer
but
not
my
favorite
doesnt
pour
like
a
traditional
cream
ale
and
has
a
little
more
carbonation
than
you
would
normally
expect
from
a
cream
ale
great
taste
and
smooth
finish
absolutely
no
hop
but
leaves
a
subtle
buttery
aftertaste
good
beer
tasty
smooth
and
absolutely
no
hoppy
taste
could
use
a
higher
abv
but
hey
its
pretty
decent
serving
type
can
o
im
a
bit
mixed
on
this
one
the
flavor
is
enjoyable
and
its
slight
complexity
keeps
one
coming
back
for
more
however
the
weak
scent
and
what
i
would
call
bizarre
feel
are
turnoffs
perhaps
this
can
was
an
outlier
perhaps
these
are
the
desired
traits
of
the
style
im
not
sure
overall
though
its
not
too
bad
and
for
something
that
is
just
as
drinkable
as
a
bud
and
not
much
more
expensive
its
not
a
bad
deal
either
o
love
the
bottle
carried
this
one
thousands
of
miles
to
china
where
im
enjoying
it
near
the
end
of
summer
light
and
refreshing
would
pair
with
lots
of
foods
especially
pizza
hot
dogs
and
hamburgers
summer
fare
light
body
though
heavier
than
a
lager
lightish
effervescence
not
bad
but
nothing
to
recommend
it
either
o
a
decent
example
of
a
pretty
dismal
style
i
dont
really
understand
the
concept
of
craft
beer
and
adjunct
ingredients
a
craft
brewery
brewing
a
cream
ale
is
like
a
woman
getting
a
breast
reduction
it
just
doesnt
make
sense
and
quite
frankly
should
be
illegal
overall
not
terrible
but
i
would
not
ever
purchase
this
overall
maybe
i
am
harsh
on
these
because
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
to
me
a
cream
ale
should
be
creamy
and
most
usually
are
not
o
not
impressed
better
than
pbr
thats
about
it
c
was
in
jax
fro
a
monday
evening
football
game
and
stayed
at
the
hyatt
that
had
the
killer
whale
cream
ale
on
tap
the
beer
is
a
light
ale
brewed
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
poured
a
light
clear
golden
with
thin
white
head
the
smell
included
grain
and
barley
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
a
very
bready
taste
with
slight
hints
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
but
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
overall
is
was
a
decent
cream
ale
and
very
drinkable
o
drinkable
as
hell
if
at
the
right
price
poured
ontap
at
the
bold
city
brewery
the
beer
was
served
up
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellowgold
coloring
slightly
hazy
with
not
a
trace
of
head
there
is
a
slightly
sour
malty
aroma
with
some
slight
musty
overtones
round
and
smooth
bodied
yet
it
remains
light
in
mouth
the
beer
has
roastytoasty
flavors
with
a
smokey
and
roasted
aftertaste
smooth
finish
this
is
wellbodied
which
is
different
for
the
lager
taste
that
this
cream
ale
carries
with
it
interesting
brew
and
i
think
it
might
have
been
a
little
bit
better
out
of
the
growler
after
it
had
some
time
to
settle
and
warm
either
way
i
would
drink
it
if
i
have
to
have
a
light
beer
let
it
be
this
its
light
and
refreshing
and
actually
has
some
fruity
notes
and
no
off
flavors
this
beer
will
pair
with
those
lighter
meals
like
salads
that
imperials
wont
its
a
golden
color
with
a
high
carbonation
which
makes
this
a
nice
bubbly
delight
the
craft
beer
to
train
people
on
ddrinkability
of
this
beer
is
as
high
as
it
is
light
i
did
not
really
care
for
its
flavors
that
much
but
if
you
did
this
would
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
you
i
did
try
the
dukes
brown
ale
after
this
and
enjoyed
it
much
better
but
didnt
have
the
time
to
review
it
in
the
future
however
i
will
pass
on
this
one
nothing
really
in
the
way
of
enjoying
this
dry
and
crisp
in
the
finish
leaves
you
wanting
something
else
low
abv
makes
this
extremely
easy
to
drink
soft
creaminess
does
not
disappoint
d
well
tastes
and
drinks
like
bud
to
me
which
i
hate
some
since
i
hate
this
beer
not
much
to
say
other
that
so
long
d
quite
drinkable
as
expected
of
the
style
this
is
not
a
complex
or
interesting
beer
but
it
fills
a
niche
and
is
relatively
good
for
what
it
is
the
malt
character
could
be
a
bit
richer
and
the
acidity
is
kind
of
offputting
but
it
is
what
it
is
d
very
drinkable
little
aftertaste
d
4
0
10
for
a
1
gallon
growler
its
good
for
a
cream
ale
i
would
much
rather
drink
the
hefe
dukes
brown
or
ipa
which
will
be
my
growler
refills
in
the
future
d
it
goes
down
ok
but
has
a
twang
after
taste
i
did
not
think
it
was
that
great
its
decent
but
i
did
not
want
another
pours
to
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
head
dissipates
very
quickly
leaving
almost
no
lacing
tiny
particles
are
suspended
within
the
clear
gold
volume
odor
is
sour
and
lightly
skunky
the
taste
is
almost
identical
to
the
smell
flavors
other
than
sour
and
skunk
are
lacking
hearty
carbonation
gives
this
a
heavy
feel
when
swallowed
this
ones
a
belcher
i
would
compare
this
to
genessee
cream
alewhich
i
feel
exactly
the
same
way
about
priced
too
high

the
quality

the
aroma
it
was
ok
the
sales
associate
told
me
that
this
was
similar
to
spotted
cow
from
new
glarus
brewery
he
wasnt
even
close
i
could
only
drink
half
and
threw
the
rest
away
im
gonna
pawn
off
the
rest
of
my
6
pack
to
my
brothers
rjt
pours
a
slight
hazy
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
but
not
a
lot
a
good
amount
of
sediment
is
seen
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
of
some
sweet
citrus
and
grains
for
the
most
part
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
very
light
hoppy
finish
that
doesnt
last
more
than
a
few
seconds
goes
down
easy
overall
it
was
good
i
didnt
even
finish
the
bottle
yeah
its
better
than
bud
light
but
thats
about
it
the
rest
of
it
was
used
for
grilling
poured
a
clear
gold
and
12
head
that
vanished
almost
immediately
smells
like
budweiser
tastes
starts
off
slightly
sweet
and
a
hint
of
orangelemon
and
then
goes
slightly
bitterastringent
tastes
alot
like
budweiser
actually
maybe
a
little
more
intense
its
drinkable
wouldnt
say
pleasant
but
not
deeply
unpleasant
either
no
hint
of
creaminess
not
much
to
recommend
here
its
drinkable
but
not
that
good
of
an
example
of
the
style
overall
a
bit
harsh
around
the
edges
so
to
speak
exposed
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
slight
garbage
like
aroma
the
taste
is
mellow
and
creamy
with
hints
of
a
nice
spice
easy
to
drink
and
nice
full
body
for
a
cream
ale
overall
a
good
flavorful
cream
ale
good
full
flavors
and
enjoyable
o
decent
nonoffensive
cream
ale
o
just
a
disastrous
cream
ale
when
done
properly
its
a
lovely
style
but
this
is
just
no
horny
goat
exposed
2
55
o
vaguely
a
cream
ale
not
bad
but
for
the
style
a
bit
of
a
miss
didnt
even
know
horny
goat
was
available
down
here
so
i
picked
up
what
singles
i
could
to
give
them
a
try
beginning
with
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
mild
corn
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
progressing
flavorwise
from
sweet
almost
creamlike
notes
to
decidedly
wheaty
and
grainy
notes
to
a
sort
of
offfruity
territory
that
mars
an
awful
lot
of
decent
progress
up
to
that
point
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
cream
ale
at
best
one
that
hints
at
some
form
of
tastiness
before
wrenching
it
away
from
me
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
and
sit
back
for
more
than
one
the
taste
does
not
get
old
or
overwhelming
if
you
enjoy
cream
ales
such
as
spotted
cow
you
should
give
this
beer
a
try
also
if
you
have
friends
you
are
trying
to
convert
to
the
craft
side
this
would
make
a
great
transitional
beer
o
decent
beer
nothing
special
a
step
above
a
budweiser
this
was
a
complete
surprise
since
the
bottle
gives
no
clue
whats
inside
as
such
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
got
a
little
more
than
i
expected
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
but
it
is
a
well
made
brew
overall
a
pretty
lackluster
brew
the
tangy
note
and
astringency
detract
from
what
could
be
a
decent
beer
decent
cream
ale
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
the
horny
goat
line
would
be
a
suitable
session
ale
in
a
bar
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellow
inch
thick
head
quickly
shrinks
aroma
is
apricot
belgian
yeast
and
bread
taste
is
mild
and
watery
for
the
style
it
works
because
budweiser
and
miller
lite
at
my
other
options
otherwise
it
wouldnt
pretty
mediocre
o
a
decent
example
of
a
cream
ale
overall
a
really
good
session
beer
very
drinkable
similar
to
a
spotted
cow
but
better
overall
not
a
true
farmhouse
or
saison
as
the
style
suggests
a
basic
macro
type
beer
here
o
its
a
nice
idea
but
its
just
not
a
good
beer
it
looks
and
smells
nice
but
then
when
you
drink
it
its
grassy
and
just
an
odd
mouthfeel
ill
pass
o
again
another
feeble
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
it
probably
has
no
business
to
attempt
when
it
can
hardly
handle
the
basic
styles
you
can
probably
blind
taste
these
beers
and
struggle
to
define
style
if
you
cant
come
close
to
style
you
should
probably
leave
well
enough
alone
fairly
boring
limited
appeal
no
repeat
quality
exposed
yeah
as
another
leinenkugel
saison
im
not
sure
it
would
be
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
of
work
and
is
highly
drinkable
it
goes
down
even
easier
than
a
bmc
for
that
purpose
it
serves
however
dont
sit
down
looking
to
enjoy
something
complex
when
you
pour
this
because
in
that
regard
it
fails
once
all
is
said
and
extracted
i
could
definitely
leave
this
one
behind
horney
goat
well
im
horney
so
why
not
right
so
this
beer
has
a
good
solid
beer
taste
nothing
fancy
could
compare
it
to
bud
miller
genuine
etc
it
is
clear
golden
in
color
thin
white
head
minimum
lacing
very
drinkable
and
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
session
i
think
so
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
not
too
much
head
on
it
smell
is
pretty
faint
with
a
bit
of
wheaty
malt
and
some
citrus
taste
is
not
bad
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
decent
some
citrus
notes
pretty
smooth
beer
not
much
aftertaste
easy
drinking
beer
definitely
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
overall
a
very
boring
beer
probably
will
never
buy
it
or
trade
for
it
not
terrible
though
hmm
it
says
farmhouse
ale
but
this
alll
macro
lager
with
a
splash
of
american
wheat
beer
sorry
guys
its
an
easy
drinking
lawnmower
beer
but
not
even
close
to
the
style
d
not
bad
as
a
summer
wheat
brew
lawnmover
beer
not
great
mind
you
but
passable
as
a
saison
like
they
say
in
wallonia
fuggitaboutit
but
even
if
they
called
it
something
else
the
rating
would
not
jump
considerably
pours
a
lemony
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
head
light
aroma
consists
mostly
of
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
decent
carbonation
moderate
malty
front
when
cold
this
beer
has
a
snappy
hoppiness
to
it
as
is
warms
though
the
carbonation
softens
and
flavor
starts
to
turn
rather
bland
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
here
probably
my
least
favorite
from
the
horny
goat
stable
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
a
hazy
white
with
a
frothy
head
the
aroma
smells
of
pale
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
bland
there
is
a
faint
sweetness
that
comes
through
but
overall
nothing
is
standing
out
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
i
guess
you
could
consider
it
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
because
its
pretty
much
flavored
water
save
yourself
the
frustration
this
is
a
beer
for
frat
boys
that
want
to
laugh
like
idiots
at
the
labels
bad
i
cant
even
bring
myself
to
rate
this
swill
terrible
attempt
at
a
saison
my
god
its
plain
horrible
tasted
like
an
aborted
homebrew
this
was
a
absolute
drainpour
the
smell
is
sour
which
isnt
bad
but
the
taste
is
like
a
adjunctcorn
laced
lager
with
some
kind
of
funk
not
a
good
funk
mind
you
just
a
nasty
rotten
off
flavor
overall
this
is
a
modestly
enjoyable
beer
it
does
not
fit
the
style
much
but
goes
down
and
doesnt
make
me
regret
the
swallow
overall
its
the
kind
of
craft
beer
id
expect
to
find
in
a
college
town
purposefully
inoffensive
d
this
is
not
a
bad
summer
beer
but
again
it
certainly
does
not
fit
the
category
of
a
saison
and
thats
the
way
i
had
to
rate
it
i
could
drink
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
mowing
the
lawn
but
if
youre
expecting
a
saison
youll
be
disappointed
d
a
decent
beer
that
is
a
terrible
beer
when
it
comes
to
what
style
it
is
trying
to
be
if
it
were
simply
an
adjunct
lager
this
would
actually
receive
a
much
better
score
but
i
cannot
give
it
since
nothing
besides
the
appearance
reminds
me
of
a
saison
moderate
body
with
a
nice
carbonation
kick
with
each
sip
carbo
level
is
mediumhigh
now
the
flavor
is
a
conundrum
this
tastes
exactly
what
a
crisp
american
lager
would
taste
like
a
good
one
at
that
plenty
of
buttery
grains
in
the
mouth
some
light
citrus
and
a
light
pop
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
if
this
was
labeled
as
a
lager
i
would
rate
it
a
b
minimum
but
as
a
saison
this
is
way
off
i
can
taste
very
light
yeast
and
funk
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
so
faint
it
may
be
my
imagination
this
one
needs
some
work
or
at
least
a
restyling
d
lacking
of
allout
bad
in
every
regard
its
an
awful
saison
if
they
can
even
call
it
that
that
may
as
well
be
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
minimal
splash
of
real
flavor
this
beer
needs
some
serious
work
also
why
is
it
called
exposed
anyway
just
part
of
the
whole
gimmick
i
would
imagine
i
can
drink
it
fine
but
every
time
the
style
saison
pops
into
my
head
i
want
to
pour
it
out
pours
a
hazy
goldenyellow
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
hops
clove
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
tartness
associated
with
this
brew
tastes
of
tart
malt
sweet
malt
yeast
citrus
and
hops
overall
this
brew
is
very
sharp
and
tart
but
lacks
the
good
complex
flavors
and
quality
body
it
is
very
easy
drinking
though
so
that
is
a
plus
not
normally
associated
with
a
saison
pours
a
bright
but
faintly
hazey
sunshine
and
hay
color
quickly
receding
two
finger
head
down
to
a
nice
film
of
foam
pretty
good
bubbling
too
the
aroma
i
faint
toasted
malts
and
even
more
faint
spice
aroma
pretty
bland
smelling
overall
makes
me
think
of
an
attempt
at
spicing
up
a
blonde
ale
the
taste
is
a
weak
farm
house
spice
with
pilsner
malts
this
beer
seems
more
like
a
keller
bier
than
a
saison
liked
a
lightly
spiced
lager
very
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
fit
the
style
pours
a
light
yellow
very
transparent
color
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
very
faint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
once
again
very
faint
and
of
citrus
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
taste
and
smell
wise
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
moderately
high
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
below
average
there
is
nothing
there
to
bring
you
back
it
is
weak
for
a
farmhouse
ale
i
guess
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
only
since
its
not
overly
offensive
but
this
is
a
very
boring
average
beer
too
bad
this
beer
gets
so
much
hype
in
my
area
i
had
high
hopes
this
for
some
reason
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
sam
adams
summer
ale
its
not
quite
as
floral
or
wheaty
but
there
are
similarities
this
is
no
saison
and
thats
where
the
low
scores
come
in
what
it
is
is
an
easy
summertime
drinker
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
withing
seconds
into
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
aroma
is
like
most
generic
pseudo
craft
beer
lagers
the
is
a
very
faint
hint
of
spice
but
i
have
to
work
to
hard
to
find
it
that
it
isnt
enjoyable
the
taste
has
some
wheatiness
to
it
but
no
spice
it
is
quite
bland
too
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
the
brewerys
website
calls
this
beer
a
saison
so
i
listed
it
as
one
even
though
it
tastes
nothing
like
one
in
fact
this
is
the
worst
saison
ive
ever
had
perhaps
it
is
more
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
but
it
would
be
a
bad
one
of
those
too
i
will
certainly
never
drink
this
again
smell
and
taste
are
awful
the
concept
of
blending
cumin
lime
and
tequila
seems
like
a
good
idea
however
the
results
are
not
good
resulting
in
a
drain
pour
o
the
smell
really
kills
this
beer
for
me
maybe
its
better
when
its
fresh
on
tap
for
the
most
part
an
interesting
concept
that
doesnt
quite
work
out
in
reality
theres
no
pc
way
to
describe
it
you
know
that
very
distinct
currybody
odor
stank
some
of
your
favorite
711
owners
rock
liquefy
that
throw
more
salt
and
cumin
on
top
and
spike
in
bad
tequila
bam
el
murcielago
heavy
cumin
boozy
and
sweet
this
is
a
relatively
quite
sweet
beer
but
they
still
manage
to
give
quite
a
pleasant
burst
in
flavors
i
liked
this
one
enough
to
pick
up
a
20
growler
very
strong
tequila
and
lime
notes
as
well
as
what
felt
like
a
slight
saltiness
it
reminds
me
of
my
freshman
days
in
a
good
less
puke
filled
way
i
had
this
on
tap
at
cigar
city
in
a
snifter
a
very
unique
beer
it
has
a
nice
full
mf
in
my
opinion
the
tequila
come
out
big
time
this
is
a
sipper
and
you
really
can
only
drink
one
or
at
least
i
can
only
drink
one
as
the
cumin
and
tequila
are
very
strong
and
totally
mess
with
your
palette
on
tap
at
the
brewery
going
into
this
knowing
i
dislike
tequila
more
than
just
about
anything
but
had
to
try
it
pours
murky
brown
like
a
barleywine
with
a
small
khaki
head
aroma
is
a
horrendous
mix
of
tequila
and
vomit
and
nothing
else
seriously
smells
like
im
about
to
just
drink
a
straight
shot
of
jose
quervo
completely
awful
after
i
build
up
the
courage
to
take
a
sipand
let
my
gag
reflex
settlethe
beer
actually
surprised
me
a
bit
it
drinks
extremely
smooth
with
big
vanilla
notes
from
the
barrel
light
lime
but
barely
noticeable
lots
of
tequila
still
but
not
offputting
as
the
nose
and
some
caramelly
malts
to
back
this
up
actually
pretty
thick
bodied
for
a
cream
ale
and
its
needed
to
hold
up
to
the
barrels
i
couldnt
ever
drink
more
than
an
ounce
of
this
and
dont
ever
want
to
drink
it
again
though
i
cant
say
it
tastes
good
per
se
im
actually
extremely
impressed
that
ccb
was
able
to
meld
these
flavors
in
a
way
that
works
pretty
well
if
youre
a
tequila
lover
sure
youve
gotta
try
this
if
you
hate
tequila
you
wont
like
it
but
its
quite
the
experience
i
must
have
a
heightened
sensitivity
to
the
cumin
or
lime
or
both
literally
couldnt
take
another
sip
past
the
first
its
a
shame
because
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
its
ok
ccb
i
still
love
you
this
beer
is
rather
insane
cumin
is
more
intense
than
most
indian
dishes
i
have
had
huge
tequila
as
well
messy
better
when
it
warmed
down
easier
to
drink
taste
gets
used
to
drink
very
unique
pours
a
light
brownish
dark
red
color
with
offwhite
head
barrel
on
the
nose
some
whiskey
notes
with
vanilla
caramel
and
oak
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
some
sweetness
and
more
barrel
character
very
smooth
o
after
more
than
two
years
in
the
bottle
this
turned
out
pretty
nicely
a
nice
malty
sweet
beer
balanced
by
the
mild
spices
and
somewhat
muted
tequila
less
than
i
remember
when
fresh
i
didnt
get
any
lime
flavors
out
of
the
beer
at
this
point
overall
quite
enjoyable
all
3
5s
i
enjoyed
my
decent
sized
sample
but
i
think
everyone
else
that
tried
it
was
not
a
big
fan
tried
on
tap
at
dld
a
very
unique
beer
this
was
the
first
tequila
aged
beer
ive
had
the
aroma
is
interesting
and
the
pour
is
a
murky
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
the
cumin
and
the
lime
peels
really
provide
an
extra
something
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
overall
its
different
which
is
why
i
picked
it
up
wouldnt
drink
it
everyday
but
defiantly
worth
a
try
just
to
check
it
out
o
very
unique
beer
that
was
pretty
good
considering
all
the
wacky
ingredients
that
going
on
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tall
eggshell
head
smells
mostly
like
lime
very
mild
spices
and
very
little
almost
no
tequila
a
moderate
malt
aroma
and
sweetness
tastes
primarily
like
cumin
theres
a
nice
bit
of
lime
and
wood
a
hint
of
tequila
on
the
finish
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
as
well
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
i
was
surprised
how
prevalent
the
barrel
was
without
the
tequila
being
too
strong
i
think
i
would
have
another
one
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
limes
lime
zest
salt
wood
and
some
slight
tequila
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
pretty
astringent
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
what
it
is
and
an
interesting
concept
for
sure
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
but
tastes
more
like
a
beer
than
it
smells
theres
still
a
margarita
feel
with
hints
of
lime
salt
spice
and
a
heavy
tequila
presence
but
the
malt
and
yeast
notes
are
more
prevalent
also
theres
a
bit
more
of
a
barrel
presence
with
dry
oak
and
subtle
vanilla
slightly
bready
with
caramel
malt
but
the
salt
citrus
cumin
and
tequila
overpower
the
other
flavors
ive
only
had
one
other
tequila
ba
beer
beforezapata
bot
which
i
really
enjoyed
but
this
one
is
a
bit
heavy
handed
for
my
liking
an
interesting
experiment
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
had
during
the
2nd
annual
redneck
racin
tastin
while
tailgating
at
the
dirt
track
race
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bross242
for
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
noda
snifter
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
sweet
malt
pepper
lime
wood
sweet
alcohol
and
cumin
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cumin
sweet
alcohol
pepper
and
lime
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
holy
cumin
batman
i
am
a
big
fan
of
cumin
when
it
comes
to
cooking
and
this
brew
carries
this
aspect
over
into
liquid
form
all
of
the
other
aromas
and
flavors
going
on
here
definitely
make
a
statement
and
mix
really
well
with
the
cumin
aspect
which
was
definitely
the
star
of
the
show
this
brew
actually
made
me
quite
hungry
too
bad
i
didnt
give
in
like
the
others
at
the
dirt
track
and
eat
a
bologna
sandwich
you
guys
make
me
sad
oh
yeah
the
brew
try
this
thing
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
ring
rich
aromas
of
buttery
grain
tequila
caramel
and
coconut
really
nice
floridainspired
flavors
carry
through
to
the
taste
lots
of
coconut
tequila
sweet
malt
caramel
and
lime
peel
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
good
carbonation
somehow
this
beer
evokes
florida
perfectly
i
get
sunscreen
sand
palm
trees
and
coconuts
really
unique
and
interesting
damn
this
is
a
unique
beer
even
better
its
damn
good
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
my
half
of
the
bottle
is
vanishing
faster
than
the
plot
of
a
chick
flick
excellent
beer
from
an
excellent
brewery
thanks
again
mike
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
cumin
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
some
cedar
thrown
in
this
beer
is
completely
unique
and
i
have
never
smelled
anything
similar
to
it
the
flavor
is
also
unique
i
get
a
lot
of
agave
syrup
and
orange
notes
as
well
as
some
cream
sugar
and
cinnamon
there
is
a
ton
going
on
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
and
every
sip
brought
me
more
and
more
flavors
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
i
had
another
glass
i
would
come
up
with
even
more
characteristics
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
that
i
have
every
tried
the
aroma
is
a
little
offputting
but
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
expectations
from
the
aroma
im
not
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
and
flavorful
beer
although
i
dont
drink
tequila
anymore
too
many
bad
memories
this
is
surprisingly
nice
you
gotta
try
this
at
least
once
pours
a
moderate
goldenbrown
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
really
strong
tequila
and
wood
with
a
bit
of
lime
the
flavor
is
the
same
the
mouthfeel
is
the
same
this
is
tequila
plus
lime
through
and
through
and
i
was
not
a
big
fan
my
friend
came
straight
over
to
my
house
after
a
trip
to
tamps
this
weekend
while
he
was
there
he
visited
the
cigar
city
brewery
and
brought
many
variations
for
me
to
try
out
the
first
one
we
cracked
open
was
el
murcielago
this
beer
looks
about
like
any
other
i
have
had
it
was
a
darker
amber
color
the
smell
was
fairly
strong
you
can
easily
detect
a
coconut
scent
when
you
taste
the
beer
however
it
tastes
like
a
swallow
of
malibu
and
tequila
perhaps
some
people
like
their
beers
to
taste
like
liquor
i
however
do
not
i
actually
really
like
this
brewery
but
this
beer
is
not
for
me
o
i
bought
6
cases
after
i
tried
this
okay
kidding
seriously
though
it
smells
and
tastes
like
vagina
is
this
good
or
bad
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
you
roll
homies
very
unique
i
guess
i
could
have
given
the
tastesmell
of
vagina
a
4
5
but
not
really
sure
i
could
drink
pour
after
pour
of
it
maybe
im
not
all
man
drink
a
great
use
of
a
under
appreciated
barrel
i
liked
it
with
the
style
they
chose
i
live
in
minnesota
therefore
its
not
easy
to
come
by
spotted
cow
i
was
offered
this
beer
as
a
sub
for
the
illusive
brew
i
was
told
id
like
it
as
much
or
better
and
alas
i
was
not
lead
astray
a
lovely
cream
ale
indeed
overall
pretty
good
cream
ale
most
cream
ales
like
little
kings
or
spotted
cow
are
so
blah
that
you
dont
really
get
much
out
of
them
but
this
at
least
has
character
wisconsins
best
cream
ale
spotted
cow
is
way
overrated
do
yourself
a
favor
in
the
summer
pick
up
some
of
these
in
the
16oz
cans
not
bottles
chill
em
then
pour
em
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
real
nice
whoa
i
thought
this
a
really
serviceable
cream
ale
despite
its
low
scores
on
here
the
bottle
popped
open
and
the
beer
poured
clear
golden
with
some
body
into
my
glass
showing
a
solid
half
inch
of
lasting
white
head
with
decent
ring
lacing
as
i
sip
it
down
the
nose
is
sweet
and
fuller
bodied
rich
with
grain
character
fresh
and
bready
rustic
even
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
some
longer
lasting
sweetness
in
small
amount
and
the
slightest
grassy
hop
presence
in
the
finish
its
rather
basic
beer
simple
and
not
intended
to
be
challenging
but
it
tastes
real
nice
and
is
supremely
refreshing
carbonation
is
high
and
it
has
enough
body
to
satisfy
a
craft
beer
guy
in
addition
to
probably
being
quite
appealing
to
the
bmc
drinker
good
first
beer
from
these
guys
i
have
one
other
in
my
fridge
i
may
dip
into
tonight
nothing
great
not
worth
its
craft
beer
price
and
not
as
good
as
heavy
hitting
cream
ales
such
as
sunlight
or
spotted
cow
but
still
pretty
decent
imagine
if
naragansett
cost
twice
as
much
as
it
does
and
youd
have
this
beer
and
there
aint
nothing
wrong
with
that
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
hard
to
make
a
distinct
cream
ale
which
this
one
does
i
needed
more
cream
ales
in
my
life
and
down
my
gullet
so
i
grabbed
some
o
this
stuff
get
some
it
pours
a
clear
sallow
damn
is
this
shit
pale
topped
by
nearly
two
fingers
of
almost
glowingly
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
corn
wild
rice
vague
sweetness
and
a
tiny
touch
of
what
may
or
may
not
have
once
been
grass
the
taste
rebounds
a
bit
kicking
that
aforementioned
sweetness
up
a
notch
and
marrying
it
at
various
points
with
mild
flowers
and
even
milder
corn
it
may
not
sound
all
that
appetizing
but
it
really
aint
bad
just
not
all
that
great
either
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
feel
overall
this
could
have
been
a
decent
cream
ale
but
it
seems
as
though
mke
went
in
the
cheaper
direction
making
something
that
doesnt
even
stand
up
nicely
to
little
kings
or
genny
cream
yeah
its
not
really
bad
per
se
just
nothing
i
would
readily
call
good
as
claimed
the
flavor
is
malty
and
lightly
sweet
with
a
delicate
hint
of
spice
plenty
of
caramel
malts
and
very
faint
spicing
that
becomes
a
bit
more
obvious
in
the
aftertaste
on
tap
at
beechwood
bbq
like
grownup
cream
soda
malty
with
a
sneaky
hop
finish
really
outstanding
overall
this
is
the
first
american
cream
ale
i
have
had
and
it
is
pretty
darn
tasty
a
good
mix
of
flavours
with
a
great
feel
im
not
sure
it
would
do
well
specifically
as
a
summer
beer
here
as
it
is
just
far
too
hot
but
ill
definitely
take
one
every
now
and
then
any
time
of
year
burnt
amber
laced
off
white
foam
caramel
and
toasted
orange
hint
of
candied
ginger
deliciously
smooth
and
creamy
great
to
drink
waiting
new
years
party
o
nothing
super
special
but
not
a
bad
brew
very
good
summer
ale
i
see
now
that
its
categorized
as
a
cream
ale
and
thats
probably
what
made
it
so
goodthat
creamy
hint
that
makes
it
stand
out
rating
a
poured
out
of
a
can
nice
frothy
head
deep
amber
color
with
a
mild
aroma
of
ice
tea
and
some
spice
tastes
of
vanilla
ice
cream
or
maybe
even
a
root
beer
float
very
creamy
and
delicious
a
fabulous
summer
beer
this
would
pair
well
with
just
about
any
desert
interesting
beer
pours
nice
and
a
decent
head
aroma
and
taste
are
both
light
to
me
but
certain
flavors
dominate
the
malt
sweetnes
come
across
strong
and
there
is
maybe
a
touch
of
light
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
and
creamy
and
would
be
a
great
fall
beer
theres
a
maltforward
aroma
to
the
disappointment
of
someone
expecting
a
lighter
beer
for
the
summer
seasonal
same
with
the
flavorit
comes
across
with
a
taste
of
light
caramel
obscuring
a
hop
kick
which
would
lighten
the
beer
for
my
enjoyment
is
this
an
amber
ale
nevermind
i
read
its
labeled
a
cream
ale
still
too
heavy
in
my
opinion
it
felt
more
like
a
fall
drinker
even
in
foggy
san
francisco
deliciously
smooth
and
creamy
cream
soda
flavor
feels
full
but
not
heavy
thus
a
nice
warm
or
cold
weather
beer
for
my
taste
i
wish
i
could
have
this
more
light
amber
color
citrus
but
more
complex
than
some
summer
brews
with
notes
of
apricot
a
tad
sweet
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
in
finish
the
caramel
loosens
and
its
sweetness
begins
to
evaporate
all
this
leaves
a
honeycomb
structure
of
malted
milk
behind
with
a
creamy
and
semidry
closure
slight
mint
and
tea
leaf
peak
through
and
help
to
keep
the
beer
highly
drinkable
and
remarkably
refreshed
this
was
awesome
one
of
the
more
inventive
cream
ales
ive
ever
had
i
love
this
beer
very
wellbalanced
taste
what
beer
should
taste
like
to
my
way
of
thinking
not
too
bitter
not
too
malty
nothing
exotic
or
gimmicky
but
certainly
not
bland
and
not
watery
nice
body
just
right
some
people
say
its
a
bit
sweet
or
vanillay
but
id
emphasize
that
these
are
subtle
qualities
too
many
beers
go
to
extremes
these
days
like
its
a
contest
to
see
which
brewer
can
be
the
most
novel
the
most
interesting
this
beer
shows
how
good
it
can
be
to
be
in
the
mainstream
if
it
is
done
right
and
this
beer
does
everything
right
i
look
forward
to
another
of
these
and
more
from
this
brewer
wouldnt
call
this
a
staple
beer
but
its
worth
a
try
despite
having
a
richer
darker
malt
backbone
that
the
vast
majority
of
summer
seasonals
the
flavor
profile
is
not
heavy
actually
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
glut
of
pilsners
and
watered
down
pale
ales
that
litter
the
shelves
during
the
summer
o
would
make
a
good
summer
at
the
beach
beer
session
suitable
nothing
about
this
makes
it
a
treat
though
o
easy
drinking
slightly
sweet
summer
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
body
is
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
recedes
into
a
thin
layer
with
a
decent
ring
at
the
edge
some
watery
lacing
smells
very
malty
with
a
nice
cream
ale
character
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
complex
or
unique
tastes
malty
sweet
sort
of
cloying
at
the
finish
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
slightly
oily
feel
not
dry
at
all
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
cream
ale
but
nothing
that
is
cementing
this
to
my
brain
as
a
must
have
if
i
see
it
on
a
tap
seems
very
sessionable
and
it
comes
in
cans
perfect
for
summer
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
with
the
rather
modest
abv
refreshing
and
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
spring
or
summer
evening
not
a
bad
little
beer
drank
it
on
a
nice
evening
on
a
roof
top
bar
didnt
feel
like
the
beer
had
much
character
or
distinctive
flavor
never
had
a
cream
ale
before
to
my
knowledge
good
sensation
in
the
mouth
but
the
overall
taste
and
smell
isnt
anything
special
overall
for
a
summer
thirst
quenchersession
beer
it
is
very
good
in
cold
weather
it
would
probably
not
be
nearly
as
good
my
biggest
concern
with
summer
solstice
is
that
it
is
too
sweet
i
only
had
one
can
to
sample
but
the
sweetness
so
dominates
the
flavor
that
i
am
afraid
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
might
overwhelm
the
palate
overall
an
a
summer
beer
i
have
not
had
one
bad
beer
from
anderson
valley
and
this
beer
as
well
as
their
winter
solstice
i
look
forward
to
ever
summer
and
winter
but
if
you
have
not
had
this
beer
you
should
grab
a
six
pack
of
it
for
sure
cheers
taste
is
smooth
and
maltysweet
with
plenty
of
toasty
grain
flavors
this
is
an
easytodrink
beer
light
and
flavorful
a
solid
and
worthy
warm
weather
brew
one
of
my
first
craft
beer
loves
overall
not
bad
but
not
exceptional
it
general
fits
pretty
easily
inside
the
cream
ale
definition
even
if
its
an
above
average
version
of
the
style
o
outstanding
summer
brew
so
much
flavor
packed
into
this
one
but
stills
stays
super
refreshing
and
unique
i
picked
it
up
randomly
and
am
super
impressed
bolder
and
has
more
complexity
then
most
summer
beers
and
really
pushes
to
the
limits
of
this
category
great
beer
this
is
my
new
favorite
summer
beer
thanks
avb
o
really
nice
very
mellow
and
smooth
lots
of
depth
of
flavor
but
not
such
a
big
heavy
filling
beer
wish
i
found
this
summer
beer
before
summer
ended
o
refreshing
enough
on
a
warm
summers
day
but
lacks
the
crispness
and
complexity
i
enjoy
in
many
other
summer
seasonals
this
was
on
a
wicked
labor
day
pricing
of
3
99
at
tw
for
that
price
you
cant
go
wrong
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
aluminum
vessel
i
get
a
huge
waft
of
sweet
malt
and
a
very
fine
bubble
creamy
head
forms
pouring
into
my
trusty
sapp
this
brew
is
a
cloudy
bright
reddish
orange
with
a
very
creamy
orange
tan
head
on
the
taste
the
brew
is
very
light
and
smooth
no
evident
bitterness
just
enough
background
to
tone
down
the
sweet
maltiness
slightly
metallic
bready
and
very
refreshing
not
anything
i
would
have
paid
the
previous
9
99
a
sixer
asking
price
for
but
for
3
99
a
sixer
this
hits
the
spot
in
the
sofla
heat
overall
a
very
cool
take
on
a
summer
style
like
you
really
need
another
wheat
beer
4
19
overall
the
first
few
sips
throw
me
off
but
after
that
i
get
used
to
it
not
excited
enough
to
buy
it
again
but
it
was
nice
cant
complain
too
much
the
feel
is
slightly
summer
but
seems
to
be
full
and
creamy
and
could
even
translate
to
a
fall
edition
i
love
most
anderson
valley
beers
but
this
is
truly
special
o
my
favourite
summer
beer
so
far
this
is
really
well
balanced
and
not
overboard
on
the
fruitcitrus
notes
while
still
having
an
obvious
summery
refreshing
character
a
very
well
done
beer
for
the
style
pleasant
sweet
malts
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
overall
im
very
perplexed
by
this
beer
it
is
both
intriguing
and
ordinary
i
would
assume
this
beer
wouldnt
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
at
this
same
time
it
has
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
summery
beer
or
at
least
has
that
feel
to
it
in
a
way
it
reminds
me
of
bells
christmas
ale
its
a
scottish
ale
when
normally
breweries
go
with
something
like
a
spiced
ale
for
their
christmas
brew
i
enjoy
the
change
up
thinking
out
of
the
box
but
at
the
same
time
if
it
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
i
have
been
impressed
anderson
valleys
beer
and
will
continue
to
try
their
products
even
though
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
i
wish
beer
advocate
had
a
way
for
me
to
remind
myself
how
much
i
dislike
this
beer
without
me
skewing
the
overall
grade
problem
is
i
am
a
dummy
and
i
keep
ordering
this
beer
not
realizing
it
is
a
cream
ale
and
i
hate
cream
ales
for
what
its
worth
this
beer
seems
to
deliver
everything
this
type
of
beer
should
its
like
a
melted
down
carbonated
popsicle
although
without
the
glamor
this
review
is
to
remind
me
to
stop
ordering
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
solid
cream
ale
it
has
a
bit
more
body
than
others
i
have
tried
but
it
is
still
easily
drinkable
the
flavor
has
a
bit
more
depth
than
im
used
to
in
this
style
im
used
to
the
simple
cereal
grains
but
the
caramel
malts
and
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
i
suppose
is
very
welcomed
here
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
its
also
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
lighter
wheat
beer
offerings
that
flood
the
shelves
in
the
summer
o
a
summer
favorite
unlike
any
other
beer
cream
ale
or
not
this
beer
has
a
profile
of
its
own
while
i
can
understand
where
some
people
will
dislike
this
beer
i
love
its
complex
flavor
profile
and
superior
drinkability
o
refreshing
beer
a
cream
ale
which
is
one
ive
had
few
of
light
and
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
summer
evening
would
pair
well
with
lots
of
foods
as
it
has
very
general
flavour
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
with
apple
pie
or
light
summer
sandwiches
and
salads
overall
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
ever
had
reminds
me
of
a
score
candy
bar
overall
damn
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
love
the
caramel
and
spices
that
this
beer
possesses
and
the
creaminess
im
going
to
have
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
this
summer
maybe
more
than
a
few
so
many
people
love
this
stuff
i
thought
it
was
horrible
wish
i
had
my
3
back
disclaimer
this
is
my
first
cream
ale
and
my
first
review
the
aroma
exudes
a
nice
multigrain
and
honey
scent
with
the
flavors
following
suit
definitely
a
darker
color
to
the
body
from
what
im
familiar
with
from
other
cream
ales
but
still
a
very
malty
very
smooth
beer
wonderfully
balanced
with
superb
flavoring
throughout
overall
great
for
a
cream
ale
this
rating
is
for
the
genre
while
not
my
favorite
style
its
a
great
example
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
well
with
any
summer
outing
easy
to
have
a
few
cold
ones
of
these
and
not
be
bored
a
delicious
cream
ale
my
first
taste
after
drinking
a
porter
was
so
creamy
i
was
amazed
such
a
rich
taste
with
hints
of
fruit
particularly
orange
among
the
cream
it
could
be
that
i
was
inferring
the
taste
as
i
am
quite
fond
of
strawberries
and
oranges
with
cream
but
i
swear
that
this
is
the
most
creamy
beer
i
have
had
it
is
so
luxurious
but
so
sipable
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
slightly
nutty
taste
which
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
favorite
coffees
just
a
really
great
beer
i
am
always
fond
of
anderson
valley
i
am
not
very
experienced
in
creamy
beers
but
this
one
stood
out
among
the
others
i
have
had
i
would
say
that
this
is
among
some
of
the
greatest
beers
i
have
had
as
i
am
a
stout
and
porter
man
and
am
quite
often
disappointed
with
beers
that
arent
very
dark
this
beer
stood
out
just
a
very
good
beer
o
for
the
style
of
cream
ale
this
is
downright
delicious
had
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
hazy
copper
appearance
offwhite
head
with
a
darker
brownishtint
lazy
bit
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
somewhat
malty
nose
with
just
a
bit
of
spice
flavor
has
a
decent
crispness
but
the
beer
is
still
a
bit
heavy
which
i
guess
is
to
be
expected
from
a
cream
but
maybe
not
from
a
summer
seasonal
the
crispness
and
clean
finish
say
summer
but
the
weight
really
doesnt
overallid
buy
this
brew
again
it
is
a
solid
summer
brew
that
i
could
easily
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
interesting
for
its
style
overall
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
a
good
one
to
give
to
your
noncraft
friends
not
as
much
traditional
character
as
one
would
hope
but
overall
isnt
a
bad
brew
to
sip
on
considering
the
fact
that
summers
in
norcal
in
the
far
north
where
av
is
located
are
usually
pretty
chilly
rainy
and
misty
i
could
see
this
as
a
perfectly
enjoyable
beer
to
have
during
the
days
where
the
weather
becomes
mild
during
the
season
in
the
region
while
i
enjoyed
a
lot
of
the
sweetened
creamy
flavors
this
has
to
offer
the
bittered
flaky
finish
as
well
as
the
enormous
syrupy
sludgy
body
makes
this
one
something
that
i
patiently
sipped
on
id
pair
it
with
food
in
a
heartbeat
think
fruitglazed
butter
fried
lamb
with
sweet
potatoes
but
on
its
own
not
so
much
more
of
an
ambivalent
dessert
than
a
quaffable
summer
beer
overall
i
have
heard
people
say
this
is
like
cream
soda
for
adults
and
i
get
that
it
definitely
has
a
cream
soda
like
quality
and
it
comes
out
strongest
in
the
mouth
taste
the
nose
is
definitely
a
more
beerlike
aroma
its
not
unappealing
though
if
you
were
to
introduce
this
to
someone
all
in
all
an
easy
quality
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
something
sweeter
something
thats
a
bit
more
than
your
typical
summery
ales
this
would
be
a
great
starting
point
overall
this
was
such
a
great
beer
and
probably
the
best
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
through
and
through
the
scents
matched
up
with
the
taste
and
the
idea
behind
the
scents
matched
up
with
the
texture
summer
solstice
is
a
great
beer
for
the
warmer
months
when
you
want
to
get
away
from
ipasdipas
for
a
few
days
and
give
your
wrecked
palate
some
time
off
its
a
lighter
ale
but
with
good
flavor
aroma
has
wheaty
and
yeasty
notes
plus
a
firm
tone
of
honey
it
pours
a
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
wheat
head
looks
more
like
a
regular
ale
than
a
wheat
but
so
what
crisp
wheaty
malty
flavor
has
yeasty
and
honey
undertones
and
just
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
smooth
flavor
has
good
body
and
plenty
of
fizz
good
for
summer
hell
good
any
time
of
year
pours
a
rich
copper
amber
hue
with
medium
off
white
slowly
fading
creamy
head
aroma
and
taste
of
caramel
malt
some
wheat
and
light
spicy
notes
with
some
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
some
wheat
and
light
spiciness
and
some
bitter
notes
on
the
for
balance
overall
a
good
solid
summer
brew
poured
from
a
355ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
copper
colour
with
a
modest
head
not
a
lot
going
on
as
far
as
aromas
on
the
palate
theres
a
little
more
as
there
are
plenty
of
caramel
nutty
flavours
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
dry
finish
but
nothing
much
in
the
way
of
hops
that
we
can
detect
not
sure
why
this
is
called
summer
solstice
when
it
tastes
more
like
a
fall
beer
sort
of
along
the
lines
of
a
marzen
um
its
basically
a
watered
down
juice
drink
no
carbonation
nasty
off
flavors
ugh
nothing
is
going
good
for
this
beer
this
is
the
last
straw
for
me
and
anderson
valley
their
beers
all
suck
top
to
bottom
im
done
with
them
my
friends
have
all
praised
this
beer
very
highly
so
now
its
my
turn
to
give
it
a
critical
shot
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
copperbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
vanilla
cream
light
wheat
light
orange
glaze
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
sweeter
notes
unionizing
for
better
flavors
for
all
and
the
orange
being
joined
by
some
pineapple
and
red
apple
to
vainly
balance
out
the
sweetness
its
a
valiant
effort
though
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
deceptively
complex
highly
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
highlights
of
coming
summers
indeed
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
honey
colored
body
with
a
very
small
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
the
smell
is
sweet
some
vanilla
notes
come
through
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
up
front
i
get
a
vanilla
flavor
to
it
its
like
cream
soda
then
comes
a
nice
suttle
hop
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
good
nicely
carobonated
and
smooth
overall
this
is
defently
a
nice
summer
beer
would
taste
good
after
a
long
hot
day
at
work
overall
a
tasty
apwa
by
anderson
valley
i
enjoyed
the
honey
and
dark
fruit
flavours
as
it
neutralizes
the
wheat
flavours
the
aroma
is
a
tad
cloying
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
this
aspect
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
that
tastes
of
berries
and
figs
very
commendable
for
being
so
unique
id
most
likely
have
this
one
again
12
ounce
can
into
pint
glass
no
canning
date
pours
hazy
orange
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
orange
biscuit
toast
caramel
nuttiness
vanilla
grass
floral
light
chocolate
and
herbal
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
strength
taste
of
orange
biscuit
toast
nuttiness
caramel
vanilla
floral
grass
and
herbal
lingering
notes
of
citrus
toast
biscuit
caramel
nuttiness
vanilla
and
light
herbal
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
fairly
robust
flavors
with
nice
balance
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
and
lightly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
present
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
cream
ale
nice
amount
of
flavor
and
balance
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
really
enjoyable
i
would
have
it
again
from
notes
8
23
12
pours
an
amber
to
brown
color
the
head
is
good
at
pour
but
disappates
quickly
and
a
small
amount
remains
on
the
top
of
the
beer
and
the
rim
of
the
glass
for
a
while
no
lacing
is
present
smell
is
nondescript
with
a
hint
of
spices
and
sour
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
taste
is
light
with
a
hint
of
sour
from
citrus
orange
and
grapefruit
overall
easy
drinking
with
some
nice
flavors
one
to
give
a
go
if
you
have
a
chance
taste
it
isnt
a
complex
flavor
but
it
has
a
unique
sweet
dessert
type
taste
to
it
this
is
somewhat
unusual
but
i
do
like
it
overall
pleasantly
surprised
pours
a
clear
deep
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
thins
out
but
never
totally
disappears
there
is
a
touch
of
fruit
on
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
nothing
strong
but
sets
you
up
appropriately
sips
are
certainly
creamy
but
the
texture
might
get
dull
after
one
beers
worth
i
like
it
its
a
stand
out
in
the
summer
beer
crowd
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
as
refreshing
as
i
like
my
summer
beers
to
be
i
still
get
at
least
one
6
pack
a
season
though
o
an
interesting
summer
pint
its
rather
simple
but
thats
appropriate
for
a
warm
weather
quaff
unique
flavor
profile
at
work
here
but
it
all
meshes
well
i
enjoyed
it
o
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
coming
into
this
beer
and
overall
i
was
disappointed
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
id
try
it
again
but
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
id
go
for
first
before
having
one
of
these
again
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
was
a
little
impressed
with
it
i
also
thought
it
was
pretty
good
example
of
a
cream
ale
the
cream
ale
aspects
of
this
beer
showed
up
nicely
and
made
this
beer
pretty
true
to
style
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
went
down
really
smooth
and
it
had
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
this
would
make
a
good
warm
weather
beer
i
could
see
drinking
three
or
four
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
afternoon
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
this
beer
was
and
how
well
put
together
it
was
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
cant
think
of
anything
that
i
would
want
to
change
about
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
nicer
cream
ale
and
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
anderson
valley
makes
some
pretty
solid
beers
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
from
them
it
sure
is
close
my
gt
to
cream
ale
is
genny
cream
its
cheap
and
tastes
good
but
i
feel
that
this
beer
has
much
better
flavors
and
overall
is
better
a
cream
ale
but
till
anderson
valley
can
match
the
price
and
put
this
in
30
packs
i
will
still
be
keeping
the
genny
cream
on
hand
but
when
i
want
to
switch
it
up
with
a
better
tasting
cream
ale
i
will
go
with
this
beer
good
job
guys
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
your
beers
c
o
one
of
americas
great
beers
perfect
sweetness
and
abv
so
you
can
drink
23
and
feel
well
satisfied
and
light
o
a
very
drinkable
cream
ale
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
summer
ale
but
a
pleasant
surprise
cheers
not
what
i
expected
but
thats
often
a
good
thing
pretty
solid
for
the
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
bodied
the
nutty
and
vanilla
flavors
are
something
not
seen
much
in
a
seasonal
summer
brew
the
creamy
tastes
of
orangesicle
and
root
beer
quench
the
thirst
but
can
be
a
bit
sweet
wow
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
summer
beer
poured
this
expecting
light
hazy
citrus
instead
i
got
a
beer
poured
copper
amber
a
nice
white
head
and
a
slightly
sweet
nose
with
a
banana
walnut
quality
upon
tasting
it
wow
different
then
anything
ive
had
before
definite
caramel
notes
and
backing
great
sweet
fun
different
i
love
it
i
respect
them
quite
a
bit
for
using
a
beer
like
this
for
their
summer
beer
so
many
breweries
seem
to
do
slightly
different
takes
on
the
same
style
for
their
summer
beers
this
is
pretty
different
and
its
actually
pretty
tasty
at
that
ill
even
imagine
that
some
people
who
dont
typically
drink
beer
could
put
this
one
down
pours
toasted
amber
with
solid
cream
top
and
spotty
lace
smells
well
creamy
with
malts
and
soft
yeast
tones
and
a
lactose
tone
a
hint
of
light
florals
flavor
is
again
creamy
weird
how
milky
this
actually
tastes
cool
some
malts
and
a
slight
oxidation
kinda
sweet
full
bodied
with
light
carb
and
a
satiating
finish
nice
beer
i
love
the
summer
time
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
long
glass
unknown
freshness
date
this
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
smells
are
of
malts
cream
and
sugar
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
pretty
good
similar
to
a
cream
soda
but
with
alcohol
o
good
drinkable
summer
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
quite
easy
to
throw
a
few
of
these
down
drinks
more
like
a
common
ale
than
a
cream
ale
too
fruity
as
well
cream
ales
should
not
be
so
i
love
malty
and
summer
brews
this
is
excellent
a
must
purchase
every
year
makes
me
want
to
move
to
cali
this
stuff
is
awesome
it
is
so
good
crazy
my
goto
summer
brew
for
sure
now
this
this
is
a
cream
ale
i
say
a
nicely
rounded
soft
yet
full
malt
base
some
quirky
but
still
workable
side
flavours
and
an
almost
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
bahl
hornin
indeed
growler
to
pint
glass
good
looking
medium
brown
pour
with
lots
of
activity
and
a
subtle
off
white
1
finger
head
that
left
quickly
smell
is
heavy
carmel
on
the
front
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
not
overpowering
but
adequate
taste
followed
the
nose
with
the
big
carmel
note
on
the
front
which
gave
way
to
vanilla
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
tart
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
much
like
carmel
cola
with
the
heavy
carbonation
maybe
some
citrus
with
the
hops
on
the
end
but
faint
feel
was
pretty
thin
and
dry
overall
a
pretty
sessionable
ale
that
is
big
with
carmel
and
carbonation
not
too
complex
and
pretty
straight
forward
with
taste
an
interesting
style
for
me
and
i
would
hit
another
on
a
hot
day
flavors
increase
as
beer
warms
which
was
a
nice
touch
overall
very
enjoyable
august
2014had
a
can
and
enjoyed
it3
75
overall
one
of
the
more
impressive
summer
releases
ive
had
its
almost
as
though
its
cheated
by
exploiting
a
loophole
an
unusually
fullflavored
summer
ale
that
still
retains
a
nice
light
feel
will
buy
again
and
soon
may
be
one
of
my
goto
summer
brews
from
now
on
light
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
this
is
not
a
beer
id
get
again
hipster
cream
ale
from
ohio
is
better
o
a
really
tasty
beer
a
great
gateway
beer
that
most
anyone
can
enjoy
this
is
one
summer
seasonal
i
seek
out
every
year
drinking
this
like
there
is
no
tomorrow
an
awesome
summer
session
ale
and
a
really
unique
seasonal
aside
from
its
limited
release
time
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
o
for
the
style
this
was
really
nice
and
much
much
better
than
many
other
cream
ales
with
natural
flavors
that
ive
tried
overall
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
beer
advocate
and
noobies
alike
o
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
too
impressive
a
hell
of
a
cream
ale
perfect
for
slugging
back
recommended
4
0
ale
flavors
lager
smoothness
this
is
what
i
recommend
to
anyone
wanting
a
cream
ale
this
is
a
dry
beer
it
drys
my
mouth
even
before
swallowing
it
its
moderately
carbonated
with
a
body
that
is
a
bit
light
but
thats
expected
ill
give
it
points
for
being
refreshing
and
moderately
drinkable
but
its
not
session
able
o
ill
tell
you
a
secret
ive
got
a
guilty
pleasure
and
its
called
cream
ale
i
really
love
em
all
spring
and
summer
long
they
are
my
goto
fridge
suds
having
had
a
lot
of
them
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
no
off
flavors
or
adjunctlike
whispers
flowin
here
just
a
great
summer
seasonal
big
thumbs
up
ill
be
grabbing
more
of
this
before
the
leaves
start
falling
d
quaffable
and
sessionable
anderson
valley
really
hits
the
mark
with
this
summer
seasonal
espcially
when
i
find
that
much
of
the
competition
is
either
too
fruity
or
lacks
any
really
substance
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
this
brew
but
it
is
exactly
what
the
doctor
ordered
on
a
warm
lazy
summers
day
overall
i
was
really
disappointed
like
i
said
above
i
dont
know
if
i
had
an
older
can
or
a
bad
batch
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
again
because
the
reviews
of
this
beer
are
decent
and
i
think
ill
give
this
a
second
chance
the
taste
was
nothing
like
the
aroma
which
was
promising
the
finshing
profile
is
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
notes
not
a
bad
beer
overall
good
stuff
cheers
worth
a
try
o
this
beer
surprised
me
it
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
it
is
a
long
way
from
a
genny
cream
ale
this
is
very
easy
drinking
with
a
lot
of
flavor
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
vibrant
rubyhued
copper
coloring
with
a
thin
coat
of
filmy
white
head
the
head
clings
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
leaving
a
decent
coating
behind
aromas
are
blended
well
with
a
mild
malt
sweetness
and
slight
citrus
highlight
a
bit
roasty
on
the
nose
too
flavors
are
a
little
more
sweet
with
a
butterscotch
and
toffee
backbone
that
has
a
good
roasting
to
it
and
gets
highlighted
with
tart
citrus
notes
and
a
subtle
hops
spicing
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
creamy
with
a
peppery
hop
presence
at
the
very
end
to
clean
the
palate
the
finish
is
quick
and
crisp
with
a
slight
effervescence
to
it
very
tasty
tastemouthfeel
tastes
of
clean
fresh
muffins
with
the
aforementioned
fruits
having
a
great
influence
in
the
mix
without
being
syrupy
sweet
and
finishing
clean
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
ive
had
that
add
different
fruits
and
flavors
to
the
mix
didnt
even
realize
that
its
a
cream
ale
until
inputing
the
review
to
ba
2
in
my
anderson
valley
mixer
and
another
solid
entry
from
the
brewery
right
away
the
chocolate
and
cream
overwhelm
the
palate
the
hops
come
through
nicely
but
not
enough
for
me
to
truly
enjoy
it
a
nice
session
beer
though
perhaps
i
just
dont
quite
enjoy
the
style
cream
ale
notes
could
have
had
a
little
more
carbonation
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
dont
have
anything
to
do
as
you
will
get
happily
hammered
quickly
od
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
for
a
cream
ale
summer
would
suggest
dry
crisp
refreshing
to
me
and
this
is
none
of
these
i
suppose
this
is
what
it
would
be
like
if
i
tried
to
make
toffee
or
caramel
at
home
overdid
itfucked
up
and
licked
up
what
was
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
if
i
would
like
that
sort
of
thing
dark
orange
in
color
very
clear
and
no
head
mild
aromas
orange
marmalade
maybe
lightly
sweet
and
somewhat
creamy
subtle
spices
with
mild
carbonation
and
very
light
body
cant
say
it
is
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
it
isnt
bad
and
definitely
different
oavoid
like
the
plague
i
mean
if
your
not
really
into
beer
its
great
and
would
be
a
great
girly
beer
for
your
missus
but
its
not
for
me
the
sweetness
really
goes
to
the
next
level
with
no
hoppy
bitterness
noticeable
to
counteract
which
really
kills
it
for
me
good
cream
ale
but
as
far
as
summer
beers
go
ive
had
far
more
refreshing
and
enjoyable
avoid
was
looking
forward
to
this
but
it
is
a
super
sweet
soft
drink
like
beer
its
nose
has
bread
dried
fruit
and
some
caramel
the
taste
has
light
spices
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
along
with
some
bitterness
mf
is
medium
bodied
with
a
rather
dry
finish
an
alright
beer
but
certainly
nothing
special
imho
o
cream
ales
are
typically
not
that
interesting
but
this
one
is
well
worth
trying
o
a
very
good
cream
ale
mouthfeel
is
great
overall
this
is
good
beer
keeping
in
mind
that
its
brewed
for
hot
summer
months
and
therefore
the
flavors
are
purposefully
kept
light
despite
this
light
quality
the
flavors
are
quite
distinguished
and
delicious
and
the
beer
is
thankfully
not
overspiced
it
is
slightly
too
reminiscent
of
a
soft
drink
for
me
reminding
me
in
this
sense
of
a
weak
cross
between
a
dr
pepper
and
a
coke
but
is
most
certainly
better
fare
than
the
average
summer
seasonal
o
i
was
expecting
not
a
cream
ale
i
guess
i
should
have
checked
before
hand
a
bit
off
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
overall
as
good
as
a
cream
ale
can
be
for
my
taste
not
really
something
i
will
get
again
though
overall
drinkability
possibly
the
most
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
had
very
thirst
quenching
without
being
watery
or
boring
this
may
be
my
first
cream
ale
so
perhaps
i
should
really
dive
into
that
style
because
ill
love
it
if
this
foray
is
any
indication
poured
from
a

finger
of
head
that
dies
down
quickly
leaving
a
decent
film
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
bready
malty
up
front
some
sort
of
lingering
fruit
smell
in
the
background
subdued
spicy
hops
first
flavor
is
a
big
bready
blast
of
mellow
sweet
malt
flavors
are
very
light
fishes
with
a
light
dry
bitterness
lots
of
creamy
little
bubbles
on
the
tongue
kind
of
a
one
trick
malt
pony
but
tasty
nonetheless
this
brew
poured
out
with
a
slight
orange
color
pretty
interesting
actually
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
amount
of
citrus
notes
and
some
smooth
malt
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
sweet
hardly
any
hops
noticeable
in
this
brew
at
all
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
very
creamy
really
impressed
by
the
feel
of
this
brew
its
still
light
and
refreshing
also
overall
the
beer
isnt
bad
id
probably
drink
it
again
one
day
this
is
the
smoothest
and
all
around
best
cream
ale
i
have
ever
had
lichi
baby
more
akin
to
cream
soda
than
cream
ale
bright
copper
vanilla
stands
out
from
the
shockingly
low
level
of
ibus
sweetness
caramel
and
vanilla
become
cloying
at
the
end
the
last
thing
i
want
in
the
summer
is
something
this
sweet
but
fortunately
i
didnt
drink
it
when
it
was
100
degrees
outside
unique
but
the
single
can
i
purchased
will
be
my
last
o
glad
i
tried
this
beer
nothing
over
the
top
just
nice
balance
very
good
summer
ale
o
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
ways
to
break
into
the
cream
ale
category
and
i
was
quite
impressed
sitting
on
the
shelf
in
a
can
it
caught
my
eye
but
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
found
it
to
be
a
light
and
drinkable
ale
with
a
hint
of
brown
ale
and
a
bit
of
lager
thrown
in
there
it
wont
blow
you
away
with
complexity
but
its
a
quality
brew
that
will
definitely
find
its
place
in
your
fridge
regularly
during
the
summer
and
fall
cheers
o
smooth
enough
summer
beer
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
for
sure
this
will
be
a
nice
change
up
from
the
usual
apaipa
summer
rotation
next
year

nice

no

mouthfeel

a
very
good
session
beer
cloudy

surprisingly
good
summer
beer
very
creamy
with
some
pineappleish
flavors
almost

some

on
the
finish
smooth

the

half

cream
white
color
densely
solid
with
an
very
even
surface
settles
down
to

the

opaque
very
consistent
from

nose
does
have
a
strong

to
it
but
quickly
settles
down
into
more
vanilla
cream
fudge
orange
citrus
and
toffee
to
chocolate
notes
pepperiness
and
rye
bread
notes
bloom
as
it
warms
the
peach

scents
more
dense
than
expressive

fullbodied
the
creamy
mouth
texture
adds
volume
if
not
weight
per
se
easy
to
identify
the
vanilla
butterscotch
honey
elements
but
its
the
pepper
garden
herbs
tea
leaf
and
country
style
bread
which
gives
it
complexity
the
orange
creamsicle
pairs
well
with
pine
notes
the
carbonation
is
active
but
in
a
more
fluffy
than
tightly
woven
manner
what
deserves
credit
most
here
is
how
it
remains
true
to
its
category
but
doesnt
settle
for
simple
and
leaves
it
open
for
the
imbiber
to
just
groove
on
the
creamy
sweetness
or
follow
the
more
unique
elements
o
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
for
dessert
its
very
sweet
with
a
good
creamy
orange
flavor
this
beer
is
much
different
than
the
only
other
cream
ale
ive
had
that
was
full
of
adjuncts
good
to
know
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
beers
within
the
style
pours
a
translucent
amberhoney
color
with
pillowy
white
head
that
stacks
a
couple
inches
webby
lacing
the
nose
is
alright
some
light
hops
and
wheat
is
noticed
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
and
sweet
and
malty
in
the
end
very
drinkable
for
such
a
summer
day
some
toffee
is
noticed
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
yet
not
too
thick
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
def
good
for
a
warm
day
on
the
porch
overall
though
i
enjoy
this
taste
so
much
i
have
to
call
good
regardless
of
everything
else
not
my
favorite
too
sweet
for
me
i
would
have
liked
it
much
more
if
it
finished
dry
would
have
been
the
refreshing
summer
beer
that
i
was
looking
for
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
order
it
on
tap
or
pick
up
a
can
or
two
its
tasty
summer
sipping
i
love
that
more
brewers
are
embracing
this
style
this
is
one
of
about
a
dozen
cream
ales
i
tasted
in
julyaugust
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
ale
or
session
beer
the
low
abv
makes
drinking
a
sixer
of
this
very
possible
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
no
bitterness
on
the
end
but
an
overall
smooth
mouthfeel
and
some
creaminess
to
the
whole
beer
there
is
most
maltiness
to
the
beginning
and
the
middle
and
the
end
sort
of
disappears
i
dont
think
id
have
this
again
ill
continue
to
look
for
a
cream
ale
that
i
like
overall
totally
acceptable
for
a
cream
ale
but
this
heavy
corn
flavor
is
offputting
for
me
3
5
d
definitely
boring
but
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
enough
to
make
this
a
good
lawnmower
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
of
the
year
i
have
tried
i
am
in
love
i
plan
on
buy
several
more
to
store
and
drink
d
this
is
a
very
good
summer
drink
id
imagine
it
would
be
great
to
pour
over
some
ice
cream
and
make
a
float
oh
yeah
the
beer
is
copper
hued
with
a
thick
lasting
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
steady
effervescence
from
the
bottom
of
the
pint
the
aroma
is
sweet
smelling
with
malt
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
akin
to
cream
soda
i
happen
to
savor
a
cream
soda
on
occasion
so
im
rather
enjoying
this
brew
the
beer
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
and
smooth
on
the
palate
one
pint
is
sufficient
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
serving
though
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
i
would
have
it
again
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
its
really
nice
and
definitely
recommended
if
youre
interested
in
this
style
of
beer
i
drank
an
entire
can
responsibly
while
writing
this
review
thats
drinkability
it
was
not
particularly
complex
but
the
straightforward
caramel
sweet
malt
is
excellent
it
finishes
clean
to
make
it
good
for
summer
while
sweeter
and
fullerbodied
than
a
traditional
summer
beer
this
was
not
heavy
finished
clean
and
was
refreshing
it
may
not
be
an
after
i
just
mowed
the
yard
brew
but
absolutely
a
sitting
on
the
patio
having
some
bbq
brew
o
real
nice
for
this
style
a
beer
i
could
have
again
i
would
prefer
a
touch
lighter
for
a
summer
brew
but
this
is
a
good
clean
flavorful
malty
offering
o
i
thought
this
brew
was
alright
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
i
liked
the
mild
and
balancing
flavors
of
the
beer
especially
the
hint
of
vanilla
that
i
picked
up
for
me
i
wouldnt
mind
tossing
back
a
few
with
friends
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
worth
a
try
for
sure
though
cheers
o
a
mediocre
cream
ale
with
a
watery
body
and
cream
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
artificial
flavoring
although
not
i
wont
buy
this
again
i
dont
really
know
what
to
think
of
this
one
i
dont
dislike
it
but
i
would
definitely
be
more
inclined
to
drink
it
when
the
weather
is
a
bit
colder
rather
than
in
scorching
summer
heat
however
disregarding
seasonal
attributes
and
concentrating
more
on
style
this
beer
is
pretty
right
on
i
cant
ask
for
more
drinkability
easily
sessionable
not
complicated
enough
to
be
distracting
price
is
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
having
several
the
balance
is
surprisingly
high
though
for
the
1
5012oz
that
i
paid
for
it
would
definitely
buy
again
and
am
curious
even
as
to
how
it
would
go
with
barbecue
or
even
hamburgers
final
notes
excellent
session
beer
easy
on
the
budget
and
its
in
a
can
so
you
can
go
anywhere
with
it
what
more
could
you
want
out
of
a
good
summer
seasonal
oa
little
more
interesting
than
the
average
summer
fare
doesnt
do
it
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
it
pours
out
a
nice
deep
amber
color
crested
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
retention
is
alright
as
is
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
creamy
with
some
nice
caramel
malts
theres
also
what
smells
a
bit
like
peaches
or
apricots
the
taste
is
quite
good
its
quite
unique
for
a
summer
beer
since
it
isnt
lightbodied
but
still
very
refreshing
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
really
does
wonders
for
the
drinkability
caramel
malts
and
the
creamy
sweetness
are
the
frontrunners
it
does
have
quite
a
bit
of
a
cream
soda
taste
to
it
the
fruitiness
also
sticks
around
along
with
a
bit
of
spicing
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
very
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
a
unique
and
tasty
summer
brew
it
makes
for
something
unique
to
enjoy
during
the
dog
days
i
really
dig
this
beer
i
really
dig
that
it
is
in
cans
too
for
the
lack
of
use
of
hops
i
would
like
to
see
a
smaller
price
point
so
i
could
grab
about
48
of
these
bad
boys
for
camping
a
very
good
full
bodied
and
full
flavored
session
ale
12oz
can
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
decent
offwhite
head
some
lacing
an
somewhat
active
carbonation
aroma
of
caramel
bread
and
some
fruits
taste
is
sweet
with
some
light
bitterness
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruit
as
well
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
finish
is
smooth
this
is
a
pretty
flavorful
beer
with
some
substance
im
not
sure
its
a
thirst
quencher
though
as
i
feel
like
id
get
filled
up
easily
drinks
easy
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
you
average
cream
ale
had
better
but
this
will
work
on
a
hot
july
afternoon
true
to
its
name
this
mediumbodied
ale
is
velvety
and
creamyalmost
surprisingly
so
delicately
spiced
summer
solstice
also
possesses
a
refreshing
tanginess
with
subtle
citrus
notes
tangerine
maybe
in
the
background
a
short
quenching
and
gently
hoppy
finish
completes
the
experience
leaving
the
imbiber
with
a
soft
sweetness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
and
wellsuited
to
warmer
weather
great
aroma
totally
different
than
anything
ive
ever
smelled
out
of
beer
this
is
a
very
homey
feeling
beer
highly
recommended
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
having
it
on
tap
may
be
a
plus
the
flavors
are
fresh
and
lively
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
may
have
another
again
we
are
reminded
of
what
our
mothers
taught
us
never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
just
because
a
beer
looks
flavourful
and
maltrich
doesnt
mean
it
is
likewise
just
because
it
says
summer
on
the
label
doesnt
automatically
make
it
a
gratifyingly
refreshing
hot
weather
quencher
pretty
much
everything
this
beer
leads
you
to
believe
ends
in
disappointment
lighter
body
but
has
a
slight
creamy
feel
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
refreshing
but
i
think
it
is
certainly
different
than
most
summer
beers
i
like
it
poured
a
light
brown
with
a
nice
yellow
hue
with
a
very
large
off
white
creamy
head
that
had
very
nice
retention
and
produced
some
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
malty
of
a
cookie
like
malt
and
had
a
nice
dose
of
a
sweet
doughy
yeast
with
notes
of
caramel
and
dried
fruit
it
tasted
extremely
malty
a
bit
sweet
and
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
from
start
to
finish
with
a
nice
caramel
note
at
the
end
that
left
the
flavor
lingering
on
the
taste
buds
for
a
good
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
very
creamy
in
texture
with
a
nice
lively
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
say
the
name
is
perfect
it
is
most
likely
the
smoothest
most
refreshing
summer
beer
i
have
ever
had
costco
near
me
sells
a
24
pack
for
23
that
is
a
steal
d
tasty
and
easy
drinking
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
decided
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
in
cans
and
it
was
just
as
good
a
very
satisfying
drink
dthe
mouthfeel
feels
a
little
thin
with
the
flavor
profile
but
is
to
style
i
wouldnt
really
a
heavier
feel
in
a
summer
beer
anyways
this
is
a
decent
summer
brew
that
offers
something
a
little
more
than
the
usual
lackluster
uninteresting
summer
ales
o
very
drinkable
and
summer
like
in
its
taste
and
feel
definitely
drink
some
more
of
this
pours
a
clear
honey
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
thin
streaks
of
lace
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
some
funky
spice
the
smell
is
almost
like
gym
socks
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
spiciness
this
beer
has
a
lower
carbonation
level
with
a
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
can
see
being
a
good
choice
in
the
warm
summer
months
the
body
is
fairly
light
but
the
feel
is
creamy
enough
with
ample
bite
to
keep
it
away
from
watery
not
too
much
to
say
here
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
flavor
is
ok
o
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
but
the
fruitiness
and
mouthfeel
is
unique
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
im
glad
they
sell
6
pack
cans
perfect
for
camping
or
the
beach
this
pours
cloudy
dark
copper
and
has
a
very
small
amount
of
head
with
no
retention
or
lacing
this
is
a
very
sweet
beverage
that
barely
tastes
like
a
beer
its
big
boys
cream
soda
although
i
dont
reach
for
one
of
these
every
time
im
craving
a
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
as
something
different
and
refreshing
the
quality
is
top
notchmedium
smooth
body
and
very
drinkable
again
not
my
first
choice
but
for
the
style
this
has
to
be
an
a
o
this
is
a
crazy
easy
drinker
and
would
make
a
solid
session
beer
i
drank
it
on
a
96
degree
day
and
it
was
damn
refreshing
very
nice
the
heavy
body
makes
it
a
beer
i
wouldnt
categorize
as
a
summer
beer
but
that
also
differentiates
it
from
the
rest
in
its
category
not
a
light
beer
by
any
means
but
quite
tasty
this
was
my
choice
of
beer
when
it
came
to
camping
high
quality
light
and
refreshing
and
comes
in
a
can
how
can
you
lose
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
frothy
ecru
foam
surprisingly
dark
for
a
cream
ale
the
aromas
arent
much
of
anything
with
this
beer
but
the
mild
caramel
and
vanilla
are
a
rather
welcome
presence
in
the
nostrils
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
to
that
of
a
mix
between
an
amber
ale
and
a
cream
soda
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
sugary
cream
flavor
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
vanilla
on
the
palate
with
a
background
of
a
touch
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
well
creamy
its
hard
to
call
it
really
anything
else
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
one
which
i
will
surely
buy
as
often
as
the
chance
arises
o
a
different
brew
thats
for
sure
pretty
enjoyable
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
providing
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
brown
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
malty
taste
is
good
malts
sweet
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
complex
enough
but
mellow
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
moderately
carbonated
and
wetting
to
the
palate
overall
not
bad
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
examples
of
this
style
overall
at
first
i
thought
it
was
just
an
average
beer
but
after
it
warmed
up
a
little
bit
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweet
aspect
of
it
its
got
a
nice
taste
that
is
fairly
different
from
most
of
the
other
summer
beers
out
there
id
buy
it
again
and
would
say
its
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
nice
cream
ale
summer
or
otherwise
though
i
find
it
a
good
style
to
make
for
summer
this
beer
does
not
say
crema
cerveza
on
it
and
it
came
from
a
can
pours
out
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
smells
quite
malty
for
a
summer
beer
tastes
is
malty
too
nice
toasty
malts
with
a
clean
hop
aftertaste
also
has
a
bit
of
diacetyl
almost
buttery
biscuit
flavor
to
it
which
i
dont
count
as
a
flaw
or
is
that
vanilla
notes
beer
says
natural
flavor
added
this
is
an
odd
beer
for
summer
might
be
more
of
a
autumn
beer
if
i
had
to
place
it
in
a
season
however
it
is
hot
out
and
i
am
enjoying
it
at
least
it
isnt
too
heavy
or
anything
like
that
very
smooth
almost
creamy
tasting
with
not
too
much
carbonation
could
make
this
a
hit
at
a
bbq
with
some
burgers
or
brats
possibly
some
smokey
pork
too
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
definitely
better
than
genesee
cream
haha
liked
it
better
than
their
imperial
ipa
too
this
beer
is
interesting
but
doesnt
really
blow
me
away
it
seems
like
a
decent
summer
offering
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
mostly
white
with
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
cheese
yes
cheese
slightly
like
swiss
oh
good
lord
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
it
taste
like
watered
down
cream
soda
medium
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
not
that
great
to
say
the
least
im
not
sure
what
they
were
shooting
for
on
this
one
slightly
sweet
start
ends
with
a
linger
cream
soda
flavor
no
lace
but
some
head
retention
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
to
think
about
this
beer
it
smells
bad
and
doesnt
taste
like
beer
at
all
what
were
these
guys
trying
to
brew
light
and
lacking
in
flavor
easydrinking
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
summer
beers
id
choose
over
this
overall
this
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
odthis
is
clearly
a
different
take
on
what
a
summer
ale
should
be
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
incredibly
easy
to
drink
no
alcohol
burn
tastes
like
cream
soda
its
pretty
damn
good
i
thought
narragansett
summer
and
hop
sun
by
southern
tier
were
the
two
summer
brews
battling
it
out
for
my
summer
goto
this
brew
just
added
its
name
into
the
race
just
completely
different
than
most
summer
brews
good
time
o
a
good
cream
ale
that
id
have
every
once
in
a
while
overall
this
would
be
a
fantastic
session
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
the
avg
joe
with
some
good
tasting
and
easy
drinking
attributes
i
picked
up
a
can
of
this
one
last
week
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
and
i
am
enjoying
it
as
i
type
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
little
offwhite
head
aromas
of
citrus
vanilla
beans
and
light
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
and
good
with
flavors
of
vanilla
spice
and
orange
tastefaint
fruitiness
slightly
sweet
malt
note
very
creamy
and
refreshing
this
was
a
nice
surprise
from
the
usual
orangelemon
summer
offerings
that
are
everywhere
this
time
of
year
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
quite
sessionable
particularly
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
clear
mahogany
very
carbonation
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
i
didnt
really
get
too
much
aroma
but
what
i
could
detect
was
sweet
malts
honey
and
light
fruit
smooth
with
caramel
malts
butterscotch
orange
maraschino
cherries
sweet
but
not
sickeningly
sweet
balanced
out
with
some
organic
grassy
notes
and
a
tad
of
earth
little
to
no
hop
bitterness
detectable

and

and
very
drinkable

was
pretty
spicy
taste
was
mostly
sweet
malt
with
a
weird
spice
presence
smooth
and
easy
drinking
w
low
carbonation
kind
of
interesting
and
glad
i
tried
it
clear

of

earth

cinnamon
gingerbread
tastes
of
gingerbread
slight

toffee
vague
cocoa
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
residual
vanilla
sweetness
zapping
carbonation
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
peculiar
tasty
beer
that
is
not
that
refreshing
but
not
that
cloying
either
flavorful
and
beautifully
different
forgot
how
good
and
easy
drinking
this
beer
is
it
pours
a
really
nice
copper
color
not
alot
of
head
however
the
smell
is
definitely
sweet
and
the
cream
does
come
through
in
the
nose
alittle
bit
of
roastiness
as
well
and
the
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
as
it
smells
up
front
sweetness
but
not
cloying
with
a
taste
of
slightly
toasted
marshmallow
on
the
backend
great
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
not
too
thick
considering
it
says
its
a
cream
beer
having
this
one
in
cans
is
definitely
gonna
make
it
a
summer
time
thirst
quencher
solid
brew
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
adventurous
and
pretty
delicious

im
very
impressed
with
this
summer
session

tasty

ton
of
this
for
the
summer
especially
since

sweet

be
very
drinkable

of
curiosity
i
need
to

and

so

plus
the
overall

makes
me
thank
dave
from
heidelberg
for
the
sample
ill
take
it
o
a
very
good
cream
ale
great
earlylate
summer
quaffer
body
is
a
bit
much
for
massive
consumption
but
a
very
pleasant
experience
tastes
much
better
than
is
smells
creaminess
most
likely
coming
from
some
adjunct
like
corn
i
believe
pretty
sweet
flavor
surprisingly
viscus
mouthfeel
interesting
beer
i
can
safely
say
i
have
tasted
nothing
like
this
almost
cream
soda
like
interesting
doesnt
mean
great
its
just
a
highly
drinkable
not
so
expensive
summer
beer
i
could
really
see
this
pairing
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
or
for
a
bbq
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
this
beer
has
an
amazing
mouth
feel
and
is
extremely
drinkable
beware
anderson
valley
did
an
excellent
job
getting
the
vanilla
flavor
and
aroma
to
really
come
across
even
your
noncraft
beer
friends
are
going
to
like
this
one
i
wait
for
this
beer
every
summer
and
do
my
best
to
find
as
many
cases
as
possible
which
usually
isnt
much
unfortunately
for
my
other
friends
who
love
this
beer
if
you
do
buy
cases
i
have
found
that
the
taste
was
not
affected
even
10
months
after
purchase
i
dont
know
why
there
arent
more
cream
ales
as
tasty
as
this
one
then
again
is
that
possible
overall
these
cans
might
have
been
at
least
6
months
old
to
be
on
discount
but
thats
no
excuse
for
a
beer
having
no
flavor
it
wasnt
skunked
since
the
boon
amber
drank
great
but
was
really
disappointed
since
this
summer
solstice
is
the
exact
opposite
of
winter
watery
light
and
no
real
beer
notes
this
is
one
i
would
avoid
might
pawn
off
a
six
pack
to
my
brother
since
he
says
he
drinks
anything
keystone
overall
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
are
superior
and
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
at
the
same
price
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
have
very
often
nor
is
it
a
beer
where
i
would
drink
more
than
one
but
it
is
different
which
is
good
an
amber
in
color
ale
that
is
heavy
on
sweet
malts
and
is
flavored
with
vanilla
giving
it
a
cream
soda
like
after
taste
which
is
kind
of
fun
its
just
tasty
and
there
is
something
to
say
for
that
value
at
this
price
you
gotta
be
kidding
d
a
decent
brew
id
drink
another
it
does
it
does
taste
like
flat
vanilla
cream
soda
beer
i
liked
it
more
when
it
was
the
first
time
trying
it
but
then
again
ive
finished
the
sixer
had
this
at
fifty
brews
in
orlando
on
bottle
wow
this
was
a
great
surprise
pours
an
orange
amber
color
and
has
an
absolutely
amazing
citrus
cream
smell
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
at
first
but
balanced
by
back
end
flavors
this
beer
is
very
unique
not
quite
a
fruit
beer
or
a
cream
ale
i
would
recommend
this
is
a
must
try
and
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
when
the
seasonal
comes
back
in
stock
i
like
a
good
cream
ale
like
the
next
guy
but
when
the
cream
aspect
consists
of
some
overly
fake
tasting
vanilla
flavors
it
just
isnt
my
thing
i
could
see
this
being
pretty
accessible
for
newtocraft
beer
drinkers
but
i
look
for
something
a
little
more
substantial
in
my
summer
beers
as
there
was
just
too
much
sweetness
here
drinkability
pretty
interesting
brew
complex
or
variable
enough
to
keep
ones
curiosity
peaked
and
goodtasting
cream
ales
are
my
favorite
style
because
of
this
beer
alone
why
is
it
so
hard
for
other
brewers
to
make
a
decent
cream
ale
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
copper
colored
and
cloudy
kinda
orange
looking
the
beer
really
had
no
head
at
all
the
beer
was
a
delicious
caramelly
tasting
blend
that
was
very
good
but
odd
for
a
summer
beer
i
liked
it
very
much
and
will
buy
this
again
a
welcome
change
from
most
summer
styles
i
always
look
forward
to
it
it
says
cerveza
crema
so
you
know
what
to
expect
carmel
and
cream
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
so
i
think
of
it
as
desert
i
do
not
know
how
one
could
give
it
a
bad
rating
its
not
as
if
your
drinking
a
light
beer
you
should
know
what
to
expect
after
reading
the
bottle
true
its
not
my
favorite
style
being
a
socal
hop
guy
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
d
very
drinkable
but
also
rather
boring
an
malt
heavy
love
the
can
though
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
amber
copper
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
strong
scents
of
sweet
candied
malts
some
caramel
some
minor
fruity
notes
the
overwhelming
flavor
was
of
sugary
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
in
late
summer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
light
carbonation
the
smooth
body
works
really
well
with
the
smooth
flavor
overall
an
ok
beer
if
you
like
vanilla
and
cake
like
flavor
to
your
beer
i
dont
this
is
way
too
heavy
to
be
considered
a
summer
beer
though
drinkability
pretty
average
the
mouthfeel
has
its
drawbacks
but
i
wouldnt
throw
this
in
your
face
if
you
offered
it
to
me
on
a
hot
day
sadly
enough
this
turned
into
one
of
my
first
drainpours
i
have
had
in
a
while
this
is
quite
a
change
for
a
summer
offerings
malty
sweetness
prevails
yet
the
ale
never
becomes
cloying
even
as
the
ale
warms
this
is
similar
to
drinking
sweet
tea
on
a
hot
afternoon
in
the
deep
south
damn
this
beer
is
tasty
so
creamy
and
rich
smooth
and
silky
sweet
malt
lovers
dream
biscuity
and
caramel
malt
with
no
toastiness
just
a
mild
touch
of
bittering
hops
give
it
a
short
clean
finish
if
i
could
get
this
in
tx
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
are
you
listening
av
12
oz
can
poured
into
a
new
holand
pint
glass
dark
ruby
orange
color
with
a
quarter
inch
of
thick
creamy
head
that
disperses
rapidly
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
light
malt
almost
cardboard
esque
and
no
hop
presence
cream
and
amber
malt
flavors
make
this
beer
taste
identical
to
a
cream
soda
there
are
also
trace
notes
of
nuts
and
vanilla
in
the
background
taste
was
surprisingly
complex
it
really
does
have
a
creamy
texture
while
remaining
light
it
is
a
little
bit
silky
but
you
just
cant
put
your
finger
on
what
is
going
on
here
beyond
saying
someone
dropped
a
creamsicle
in
the
vat
missing
the
trademark
hopping
and
bitterness
of
most
of
their
beers
this
is
just
a
smooth
summer
ale
a
little
bit
of
honey
i
guess
d
as
i
said
its
tasty
and
light
with
a
low
abv
so
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
you
fancy
the
taste
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
flavor
profile
is
interesting
enough
yet
simple
which
makes
for
easy
consumption
the
abv
is
on
the
low
end
still
which
also
makes
it
more
sessionable
overall
a
decent
little
beer
d
only
one
at
a
time
fun
beer
on
occasion
though
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
not
too
thick
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
something
i
bought
on
a
whim
but
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
this
is
an
oddball
of
a
beer
that
almost
seems
out
of
season
but
i
can
definitely
see
knocking
a
few
of
these
back
in
the
hot
sun
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
this
beer
is
almost
like
a
low
gravity
dubbel
with
some
spice
and
a
lagerish
character
like
a
cream
soda
with
booze
reccomended
drinkable
yes
probably
though
i
wont
return
to
it
would
i
buy
more
of
it
sure
its
available
out
here
on
the
east
coast
and
a
great
canned
summer
brew
toffee
and
cream
soda
come
to
mind
in
the
first
sips
later
backed
by
a
lightly
nutty
husky
grain
light
toasted
malt
sweetness
and
a
mild
apple
astringency
sort
of
watery
with
a
sweet
slickness
bigger
on
flavor
than
body
still
a
couple
of
these
poolside
wouldnt
be
a
bad
option
a
good
crossover
craft
beer
i
had
this
on
draft
at
the
sunset
grill
on
a
recent
visit
to
boston
the
bartender
was
not
able
to
tell
me
the
style
and
called
it
a
light
ale
with
some
interesting
character
i
think
that
it
probably
wasnt
a
bad
description
for
this
beer
kind
of
a
coppergold
color
and
very
clear
especailly
for
a
summer
ale
good
flavor
interesting
character
overall
id
say
it
was
pretty
good
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
the
beer
pretty
nice
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
to
have
during
the
summer
months
as
it
does
a
good
job
of
cooling
you
down
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
a
good
cream
ale
some
flaws
but
we
have
to
open
our
minds
and
shake
our
hop
addictions
sometime
i
find
no
hops
here
this
is
a
real
easy
drinker
but
i
wonder
about
refreshment
so
smooth
and
unabrupt
im
not
sure
this
could
quench
me
in
succession
on
a
hot
day
1
or
2
and
id
be
done
no
knocks
here
once
again
another
good
brew
from
these
guys
yes
a
cream
soda
in
beer
form
but
nicely
done
if
a
little
underwhelming
could
use
more
carbonation
if
this
is
trying
to
be
a
summer
session
beer
as
is
neither
interesting
enough
nor
light
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
and
a
half
at
a
sitting
d
the
taste
has
you
calling
back
for
more
but
the
cream
side
of
things
this
is
not
a
beer
to
drink
a
session
of
good
for
summer
tastings
but
not
my
type
of
summer
slammer
cream
ale
is
a
strange
and
unorthadox
style
for
the
summertime
even
more
strange
is
that
i
enjoy
the
flavor
quite
a
bit
when
i
didnt
think
i
would
my
only
gripe
a
bit
pricey
for
a
summer
ale
if
you
ask
me
their
ipa
is
cheaper
and
with
a
much
higher
abv
should
be
in
the
8
00
range
not
10
00
picked
this
up
at
a
great
beer
store
tops
liquor
while
at
a
conference
in
phoenix
nice
clear
copperruby
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
head
and
minimal
lacing
kind
of
a
metalic
smell
almost
like
pennies
with
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
and
roses
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
name
very
reminiscent
of
shasta
cream
soda
lots
of
creamy
caramel
with
a
hint
of
peach
and
tea
very
light
smooth
creamy
mothfeel
good
drinkable
summer
beer
that
truly
surprised
me
edit
i
had
another
one
of
these
tonight
i
had
to
take
a
few
points
off
it
was
an
exciting
drink
but
the
second
time
around
after
the
novelty
wears
of
it
tastes
a
bit
more
tiney
this
has
got
to
be
the
most
unique
summer
seasonal
ive
tried
and
i
was
expecting
a
sweeter
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
sweetness
is
on
the
light
side
and
nicely
balanced
by
hops
an
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
not
very
glad
i
only
got
a
single
interesting
to
try
but
would
not
try
it
again
f
still
somewhat
sweet
a
little
syrupy
and
sticky
more
toasty
malts
lingering
with
creamy
malts
lots
of
creamy
flavors
lingering
perhaps
more
oats
i
think
i
get
a
touch
of
biscuit
as
well
on
the
finish
some
lingering
sticky
sweet
slight
syrupy
malts
that
gives
me
that
reminiscence
of
lager
again
a
little
strange
fruit
comes
through
as
well
flavorful
light
good
for
summer
but
the
flinty
taste
is
not
so
pleasant
after
a
while
still
id
have
it
again
give
it
another
shot
drinkability
personally
i
wouldnt
be
all
too
excited
to
down
this
one
more
than
on
the
odd
occasion
however
considering
what
these
beers
are
suppose
to
be
like
id
say
this
cream
ale
fills
the
a1
formula
out
pretty
nicely
d
this
is
my
first
cream
ale
very
smooth
goes
down
so
nicely
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
one
has
some
more
substance
than
most
cream
ales
and
is
a
decent
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
nearly
as
good
as
winter
solstice
but
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
either
i
guess
it
is
intriguing
to
mix
a
british
cream
beer
with
a
german
wheat
but
it
doesnt
really
work
for
me
i
know
this
beer
has
lots
of
fans
but
to
me
any
light
lager
would
do
better
at
a
bbq
this
beer
is
surprisingly
light
and
crisp
and
when
i
first
took
a
sip
i
immediately
thought
of
cream
soda
its
a
very
mellow
summer
beer
that
would
go
great
after
mowing
the
grass
or
while
bbqing
some
steaks
alcohol
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
but
the
taste
of
cream
and
vanilla
are
light
but
pleasing
ill
have
to
give
good
points
to
taste
and
drinkability
on
this
one
but
will
say
its
lacking
in
the
nose
significantly
could
be
the
can
though
p
as
for
the
drinkability
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
it
is
probably
the
easiest
drinking
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
i
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
and
stock
up
before
summer
ends
there
is
nothing
like
a
bbq
in
the
summer
with
a
bottle
of
this
d
i
cant
say
ive
had
too
many
cream
ales
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
enjoyable
a
nice
low
alcohol
beer
with
good
flavors
and
a
lightmedium
body
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
pink
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
very
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
and
strawberries
with
no
real
beer
characteristics
the
taste
is
much
the
same
but
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
would
drink
again
compared
to
other
cream
ales
ive
had
this
was
pretty
good
i
was
disappointed
with
the
head
on
the
beer
which
was
nonexistant
anybody
that
reads
my
reviews
knows
that
i
like
a
beer
with
a
big
frothing
head
anyway
i
did
like
the
nice
creamy
taste
with
the
light
malt
finish
definitely
would
classify
this
as
a
warm
weather
brew
it
warms
up
nicely
the
malt
and
sweetness
round
out
to
something
much
richer
and
more
pleasant
perhaps
my
palate
was
slow
in
recovering
from
the
preceding
ipa
the
creaminess
is
much
more
noticeable
about
halfway
through
notes
bbcsd0909danm
d
this
is
a
really
nice
cream
ale
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
one
id
grab
again
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
it
doesnt
quite
get
there
for
me
the
sweet
clean
and
fresh
malty
character
is
interesting
but
is
executed
better
on
other
avbc
beers
this
actually
reminded
me
of
a
boont
light
at
moments
probably
wont
be
in
my
fridge
again
anytime
soon
but
its
an
okay
beer
so
easy
to
drink
delicious
and
full
of
character
this
is
another
smashhit
from
anderson
valley
and
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
decent
drinkability
though
i
imagine
i
would
want
something
a
little
more
substantive
for
a
long
session
review
notes
taken
on
72909
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
im
more
of
a
david
lee
roth
guy
not
sammy
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
overly
drinkable
d
maybe
my
judgment
was
clouded
by
the
uniqueness
of
the
superfloral
aroma
but
i
definitely
was
able
to
throw
a
few
of
these
down
notesnot
an
offensive
beer
at
all
but
just
boring
dont
know
what
they
were
going
for
here
if
it
was
a
dull
creamy
light
bodied
amber
ale
they
did
it
drinkability
was
good
for
me
and
makes
me
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
sixer
and
not
a
single
d
slightly
lacking
in
the
drinkability
department
i
really
didnt
feel
inclined
to
finish
this
brew
youve
heard
of
dessert
wines
of
course
you
have
this
is
a
dessert
beer
definitely
not
a
standalone
beer
d
because
of
the
light
body
this
beer
goes
down
easy
it
wont
win
any
points
for
complexity
but
if
youre
a
malt
fan
this
is
sweet
and
satisfying
one
of
the
few
malt
beers
you
could
actually
stand
to
drink
in
the
heat
of
summer
as
a
side
note
after
having
half
the
12
oz
bottle
for
rating
i
asked
my
dad
if
he
wanted
to
finish
it
he
took
a
sip
and
by
the
look
on
his
face
that
was
a
no
needless
to
say
it
was
a
drainpour
also
there
was
no
date
i
wonder
based
on
all
the
positive
ratings
if
mine
was
way
too
old
full
and
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
bubbly
finish
very

good

for
on
a
hot
summer
day
nice
drinkability
on
this
one
it
nails
its
style
one
ill
return
to
on
two
counts
its
a
fantastic
beer
and
its
not
your
run
of
the
mill
summer
seasonal
type
beer
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
overall
impression
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
but
an
enjoyable
summertime
brew
drinkability
i
like
the
creamy
caramal
malt
taste
that
i
associate
more
with
a
ris
this
one
hits
the
style
guidelines
to
a
t
i
could
have
several
of
this
minimalt
bomb
the
head
produced
a
nice
fingers
worth
of
ecru
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
color
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
slight
sweetness
of
caramel
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
with
a
very
caramellike
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
slight
sweetness
giving
way
to
a
dryness
this
was
head
and
shoulders
above
the
crappy
malt
liquors
that
i
drank
today
i
almost
have
to
restrain
my
numbers
on
this
one
this
would
be
an
outstanding
beer
at
the
beach
d
very
drinkable
ill
have
another
notes
and
comments
wouldnt
order
this
beer
again
just
took
one
for
the
drinking
card
typical
bread
flavors
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
nice
deep
amber
that
is
crystal
clear
with
a
thing
foamy
head
smell
is
caramel
malts
cream
vanilla
and
lemon
juice
taste
is
a
wonderful
creamy
smooth
malty
vanilla
and
sugar
mouthfeel
is
good
really
thick
and
smooth
drinkability
is
fantastic

solstice
cerveza

pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thick
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
on
the
malty
end
of
the
scale
and
is
also
a
bit
fruity
malt
dominates
the
flavor
and
there
is
a
touch
of
fruit
here
too
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
as
is
appropriate
easy
drinking
worth
a
try
overall
a
nicely
done
brew
drinks
very
easily
and
possibly
the
best
cream
ale
ive
had
though
its
more
of
a
lager
than
a
cream
ale
in
my
opinion
certainly
worth
trying
and
very
sessionable
drinkability
very
tastes
great
goes
down
great
recommended
poured
into
my
trusty
dogfish
head
pint
a
medium
amber
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
while
drinking
a
mild
smell
of
candy
faint
hops
and
some
strong
malt
this
is
the
creamiest
beer
ive
ever
had
super
smooth
lots
of
lactose
and
almost
too
sweet
the
taste
is
the
best
part
it
does
definitely
taste
good
in
hot
weather
and
would
go
well
with
some
chirizo
tacos
nice
and
velvety
smooth
in
the
mouth
but
a
touch
sticky
low
alcohol
nice
weight
and
pleasant
taste
makes
this
a
good
choice
for
summer
parties

a

quite

not
generally

good
representation

a
cream
ale

little
on
the
side
of
being
too
sweet

the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
with
a

carry
it

the
alcohol
is
a

too
high
for
the
drinkability
d
very
goes
down
easy
ha

almost
drank
this
one
too
fast
great
sit

the

kind
of
beer
thirst
quenching
and
very
refreshing
redamber
in
color
it
was
poured
with
no
head
medium
carbonation
with
a
tinge
of
cloudiness
a
definite
caramel
nose
was
confirmed
by
the
first
sip
which
was
a
bit
on
the
cloying
side
no
hopping
to
speak
of
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
was
reminded
of
cheap
caramel
candy
the
finish
was
pedestrian
i
was
glad
to
finish
this
one
i
wont
be
having
another
not
the
typical
zesty
highly
carbonated
summer
beer
that
i
usually
expect
when
i
pick
one
of
these
up
but
nonetheless
pretty
tasty
and
something
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
after
a
good
bike
ride
or
hike
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
twofinger
head
and
some
lacing
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
some
tart
fruity
hops
lightbodied
and
smooth
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
go
down
has
a
lot
of
sweetnees
thanks
to
the
malts
mostly
caramel
and
has
some
tart
fruit
flavors
tucked
in
the
background
pear
rinds
apples
finishes
clean
definite
lawnmower
beer
that
is
enjoyable
over
a
macro
anyday
the
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
like
taffy
or
candied
fruits
there
is
a
ton
of
very
sweet
caramel
malts
the
distinct
vanilla
flavors
of
an
old
fashioned
cream
soda
some
apple
and
pear
flavors
the
beer
is
not
overly
carbonated
and
not
as
syrupy
thick
as
it
may
seem
by
appearances
the
beer
is
very
nice
very
interesting
and
refreshing
and
a
real
change
up
type
of
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
candied
fruit
type
experience
or
have
a
yen
for
an
old
fashioned
cream
soda
from
an
embossed
bottle
or
want
some
caramel
taffy
than
this
is
your
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
the
aftertaste
has
some
of
sweetness
lingering
lchaim
tmd
honey
and
spices
offer
contrasting
but
complementary
malts
and
hops
a
little
watery
at
moments
in
the
sip
light
body
drinks
like
a
lager
with
medium
carbonation
and
great
drinkability
ive
had
this
one
twice
now
and
there
is
definitely
metallic
note
upon
each
sip
caramel
sweetness
comes
out
with
warmth
this
beer
is
great
for
a
summer
day
but
also
worked
surprisingly
well
as
a
dessert
drink
i
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
this
6er
well
done
avbc
d
i
like
the
variation
of
a
summer
brew
something
different
i
was
expecting
a
wheat
type
of
beer
and
was
wonderfully
surprised
by
a
tasty
cream
ale
d
a
single
pint
or
maybe
a
couple
12
oz
bottles
but
no
more
than
that
the
label
says
that
it
is
ohso
drinkable
and
as
a
warm
weather
beer
i
disagree
feeling
this
beer
is
more
reserved
for
tasting
and
not
out
by
the
pool
in
warm
weather
as
this
is
noted
a
seasonal
beer
i
can
only
imagine
that
it
has
been
sitting
on
the
beer
store
shelves
for
quite
some
time
as
a
reviewer
below
mentioned
this
beer
may
have
mellowed
quite
a
bit
from
when
it
was
first
bottled
unfortunately
i
did
not
notice
a
date
ill
definitely
have
to
try
this
again
in
the
summer
pours
dark
amber
in
color
with
no
head
forming
on
the
pour
smell
is
slightly
spicy
and
very
fainlty
hopped
not
much
going
on
in
the
taste
some
fruity
flavors
very
weak
hops
this
is
a
pretty
weak
flavored
beer
very
muted
and
watered
down
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
ill
wait
for
the
winter
solstice
to
come
out
a
truly
wonderful
malty
refreshing
summer
beer
though
i
may
not
pony
up
the
dough
for
this
beer
with
any
great
regularity
i
certainly
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
bed
for
eating
crackers
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
one
all
summer
and
if
i
had
one
summer
beer
that
i
could
pick
this
would
be
the
one
excellent
job
from
anderson
valley
and
i
am
eager
to
search
out
the
winter
solstice
as
well
solid
refreshing
summer
brew
notes
from
91505
pretty
drinkable
rather
interesting
the
taste
is
again
mostly
unpasteurized
unfiltered
apple
juice
especially
up
front
however
it
has
a
light
toasty
bread
element
and
a
hint
of
burnt
buttery
caramel
its
faintly
sweet
with
otherwise
only
a
faint
apple
tartness
up
front
and
the
light
toasty
element
to
balance
it
really
is
very
subdued
in
flavour
and
rather
bland
but
pleasant
somewhat
interesting
in
the
character
that
it
has
and
drinkable
it
goes
pretty
well
with
food
i
only
had
one
bottle
and
can
imagine
giving
a
higher
rating
after
having
a
few
more
maybe
next
summer
think
scotch
ale
light
its
too
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
alone
i
believe
that
a
pungent
cheese
or
a
spiced
appetizer
im
thinking
something
with
dill
might
make
this
beer
more
palatable
not
sure
id
pay
the
price
on
too
many
occasions
though
twice
as
much
as
other
beers
of
equal
or
better
taste
a
great
beer
for
the
warm
weather
and
very
clean
considering
what
its
comprised
of
this
beer
is
made
for
sitting
up
in
mendocino
county
by
the
river
on
a
hot
day
and
watching
the
birds
play
in
the
water
slightly
sweet
dominated
by
light
and
toasty
caramel
malts
easy
to
drink
quickly
but
a
little
cloying
in
the
long
run
due
to
the
uncomplicated
flavor
profile
and
lack
of
bitterness
or
discernable
hop
character
best
way
to
have
this
would
probably
be
cold
on
a
hot
day
was
quite
surprised
at
the
color
texture
and
taste
of
this
summer
beer
it
drinks
very
nice
i
detected
a
great
amount
of
carmel
in
this
beer
as
it
sat
and
aged
a
bit
in
the
glass
a
rich
creamy
head
is
certainly
a
nice
component
of
this
beer
it
is
the
first
i
have
drank
from
anderson
valley
i
found
it
intriguing
enough
to
want
to
try
a
few
more
from
this
brewery
never
had
a
cream
ale
this
dark
and
its
pretty
enjoyable
smooth
and
creamy
with
some
decent
flavors

cloying
but
a
good

of
character
worth
a
try
for
sure
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
chestnut
with
a
creamy
head
and
some
scattered

the
aromas
are
very
light
but
there
is
a
light
nuttiness
and
creaminess
as
well
as
some
sweet

taste
is
likewise
nutty
creamy
a
touch
roasty
and
with
maybe
a
touch
of

to
see

beer
that
was

glimpses
of
ruby
verry
pretty
slight
head
that
holds
fairly
well
beer
looks
good
smell
hard
to
tell
some
malt
hint
of
fruit
taste
kind
of
average
with
again
hints
of
fruit
i
may
be
way
off
base
here
but
i
got
kind
of
a
hint
of
cough
medicinecherry
mouthfeel
a
little
less
than
average
carbed
wasnt
loving
the
feel
or
the
flavor
i
may
try
again
earlier
in
the
season
because
something
just
didnt
seem
right
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
and
heaven
knows
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
cream
ales
but
this
is
not
one
that
id
seek
out
just
too
average
to
my
palate
clear
copper
thin
dirty
white
head
lace
comes
in
sporadic
rings
smells
pretty
sweet
cream
ale
sweet
which
is
good
sweet
caramely
flavor
too
this
summer
solstice
is
actually
reminiscent
to
their
winter
solstice
in
the
candy
like
sweet
maltiness
only
its
held
in
check
here
a
little
more
really
a
nice
level
creamy
sweetness
here
hops
are
negligible
as
they
should
be
the
mouthfeel
you
guessed
it
creamy
lightly
carbonated
with
just
the
slightest
prick
of
co2
cant
find
any
fault
with
this
as
it
is
nice
beer
lightbodied
with
mediumcarbonation
easy
drinking
though
not
what
i
quite
would
look
for
in
a
summer
brew
caramel
was
a
bit
too
strong
in
aroma
and
flavor
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
beer
settled
with
a
dark
amber
appearance
and
a
thin
but
creamy
head
aromas
had
a
great
malty
spice
kick
to
it
that
was
incredibly
appetizing
overall
taste
was
creamy
and
malty
making
a
wicked
sweet
summer
drink
mouthfeel
helped
make
the
drink
creamy
but
i
felt
it
was
a
little
flat
texturewise
overall
a
tasty
treat
d
drank
like
a
sweet
amber
and
had
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
drinkability
factor
d
as
a
beer
it
has
its
good
points
but
in
the
end
i
just
found
it
mediocre
honestly
they
should
probably
drop
a
lot
of
the
hops
out
of
this
and
concentrate
on
the
malt
profile
of
this
beer
it
was
by
far
my
favourite
part
after
that
it
could
be
a
good
summer
refresher
but
right
now
for
me
the
malt
and
hop
flavours
conflict
instead
of
complementing
each
other
d
too
sweet
for
me
this
one
was
a
big
dissapointment
in
my
book
didnt
enjoy
it
at
all
d
nice
worth
a
try
and
worth
having
again
for
a
cream
or
brown
ale
this
is
enjoyable
this
beer
was
a
malty
mess
in
my
humble
opinoin
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
1
finger
offwhite
head
with
no
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
of
malt
some
biscuit
and
an
overall
off
scent
taste
is
the
same
malty
malty
malty
really
dont
notice
much
else
i
have
to
say
maybe
i
just
dont
get
this
one
i
dont
know
lower
carbonation
leaves
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
was
the
one
thing
i
didnt
mind
about
the
beer
it
did
go
down
smooth
overall
just
not
impressed
and
will
most
likely
not
revisit
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
grey
lodge
in
philly
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
definitely
worth
getting
my
growler
filled
with
it
poured
a
nice
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
was
consisted
of
candy
sugar
spices
hops
and
malts
the
taste
was
a
very
well
balanced
mix
of
the
candied
sugars
spices
malts
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
delicious
and
the
drinkability
was
very
easy
a
great
summer
beer
to
enjoy
anywhere
oelergud
full
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
thick
and
chewy
for
the
low
abv
and
lack
of
complexity
pretty
drinkable
pours
a
dark
brown
red
with
minimal
white
head
light
malty
aroma
with
minimal
sweetness
solid
malt
taste
with
hops
and
a
slightly
floral
aftertaste
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
a
nice
session
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
velvety
texture
is
punctuated
by
a
crisp
slightly
aggressive
introduction
that
livens
the
tip
of
the
tongue
slick
as
it
is
in
the
mouth
the
swallow
isnt
magical
as
it
might
seem
its
an
easy
drinkable
beer
that
could
absolutely
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
at
the
poker
table
assumed
by
the
name
summer
solstice
it
was
a
wheat
beer
and
that
was
entirely
incorrect
nonetheless
appearance
is
solid
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
leaves
alright
lacing
nose
is
quiet
toffee
malt
a
kind
of
smooth
butteriness
to
it
very
mild
taste
is
similar
very
mild
caramel
malt
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
killians
both
in
terms
of
taste
and
intensity
of
flavor
aka
mild
as
hell
light
spiciness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
i
had
to
search
for
it
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
very
mild
citrus
body
is
medium
a
little
thin
but
its
not
carrying
any
flavor
so
i
dont
really
care
overall
theres
just
no
point
to
drinking
this
one
decent
stuff
but
all
in
all
nothing
to
write
home
about
poured
a
deep
rich
amber
nice
headwith
decent
retentionand
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
breadand
malt
body
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
taste
is
bready
and
malted
sweet
and
smooth
from
start
to
finish
good
beer
but
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
and
really
the
vanilla
should
be
in
a
cup
of
tea
i
dont
ever
see
the
brew
being
refreshing
in
summer
on
any
other
time
of
year
first
drain
pour
in
recent
memory
mfd
interesting
texture
its
silky
and
very
drinkable
certainly
living
up
to
its
name
cerveza
crema
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
summer
months
personally
thinking
that
the
texture
and
slight
weight
doesnt
really
lend
itself
to
session
drinking
but
id
kick
off
an
evening
bbq
with
a
round
of
these
for
sure
overall
on
of
the
strangest
of
summer
beers
i
have
ever
had
ofr
sure
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
thats
for
sure
maybe
next
time
i
will
try
it
next
year
and
see
if
it
changes
any
12
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
medium
brown
with
a
thick
full
head
nose
of
sweet
malt
pink
popcorn
and
hint
of
spice

taste
of
kettle
corn
malt
and
slight
orange
body
is
semi
sweet
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
malts
kettle
corn
and
some
acidity
d
this
could
be
a
good
summer
beer
except
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
taste
this
one
is
drinkable
but
not
one
that
i
would
be
willing
to
drink
again
some
may
say
its
a
bit
intense
for
a
cream
but
its
right
up
my
alley
it
didnt
fit
the
cookie
cutter
standard
for
a
cream
and
im
giving
it
extra
points
for
that
dont
see
this
one
all
to
often
here
but
if
it
shows
up
ill
jump
on
a
6pack
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
piza
port
glass
nice
foam
retention
with
a
white
head
set
off
by
a
red
copperish
color
based
with
amber
the
smell
hints
at
light
sugar
and
spice
the
taste
reflects
creamy
vanilla
honey
malt
with
a
very
low
bitter
off
set
mouth
feel
is
light
with
a
pop
that
makes
it
an
easy
drinking
beer
drank
four
of
these
in
one
night
very
drinkable
mostly
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
something
extra
the
flavor
is
mostly
malty
but
there
is
a
good
balance
of
hop
spiciness
which
makes
it
just
a
little
bit
bolder
than
the
usual
light
summer
fare
but
just
light
enough
to
refresh
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
great
taste
that
keeps
me
interested
with
a
nice
aftertaste
but
the
whole
experience
is
lacking
a
little
for
the
complexity
of
the
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
depth
in
body
and
some
more
aromatic
qualities
a
cream
ale
with
some
attitude
a
definite
fruitinesspeaches
and
cream
though
the
finish
is
a
bit
odd
overall
on
the
very
sweet
side
though
quite
tasty
i
am
of
the
school
that
this
is
not
a
summer
beer
which
i
would
imagine
something
kolsch
rather
a
cream
soda
substitute
full
mouthfeel
d
a
sweet
ale
w
pleasant
malt
and
decent
drinkability
w
mild
spice
and
malty
goodness
a
good
choice
for
a
late
summer
seasonal
the
butterscotch
flavor
and
mediumlight
body
keep
it
going
down
smooth
like
a
iced
caramel
machiato
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
dark
red
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
head
the
last
didnt
last
longer
then
a
minute
except
for
a
very
small
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
smelled
slightly
sweet
almost
like
a
candied
orange
flavor
reminded
of
a
winter
seasonal
spicy
but
still
smooth
felt
great
in
the
mouth
nice
and
creamy
just
enough
to
coat
and
linger
inside
the
mouth
but
not
so
much
to
be
syrupy
left
a
touch
of
spicy
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
went
down
well
a
very
nice
very
unusual
beer
that
i
love
but
dont
expect
your
typical
summer
ale
this
is
heavier
and
sweeter
than
others
you
might
group
with
it
overall
a
good
summer
ale
when
i
think
summer
ale
i
think
of
a
beer
that
is
refreshing
like
lemonade
and
this
one
meets
that
criteria
i
dont
think
the
six
pack
will
last
much
longer
than
a
hour
or
two
this
beer
was
rather
light
and
sessionable
as
is
typically
the
case
with
summer
ales
the
lack
of
flavor
however
would
make
me
want
to
stop
drinking
this
after
only
a
few
worth
a
try
clear
rusty
orange
with
a
sticky
yellowish
head
the
aroma
is
faint
sweet
and
toasted
malts
sort
of
like
sugary
toffee
and
butterscotch
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
orange
nice
but
timid
a
slick
sweetness
stays
upfront
in
the
taste
and
works
well
with
some
spices
and
toasted
grains
its
a
pleasant
refreshing
blend
of
flavors
actually
its
reminding
me
a
little
of
candy
corn
which
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
it
sounds
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
becomes
more
interesting
and
pronounced
solid
smooth
mouthfeel
goes
down
nicely
this
is
a
quality
and
perhaps
more
importantly
different
no
lemon
and
wheat
summer
seasonal
drinkability
very
approachable
for
both
casual
drinkers
and
craft
fans
pricy
at
10
per
sixer
but
id
get
it
again
drinkability
is
good
nothing
really
present
to
make
this
hard
to
swallow
overall
a
summer
beer
that
carries
a
fresh
orange
taste
on
the
darker
side
which
makes
it
even
more
intriguing
very
cool
label
with
the
bears
with
antlers
and
sunglasses
cryptic
writing
under
the
capchipmunk
the
heelch
of
the
boont
steinbier
huh
hilarious
im
happy
with
this
one
except
the
price
11
996pk
in
hindsight
this
was
actually
fairly
similar
to
their
winter
solstice
no
coincidence
im
sure
this
was
a
ambercopper
color
darker
than
any
other
cream
ale
ive
encountered
with
an
incredibly
smooth
malt
profile
to
back
it
up
there
was
strong
spice
note
that
was
almost
fruity
and
earthy
it
was
a
touch
heavy
but
it
was
still
nice
to
drink
and
tasty
a
very
interesting
twist
for
a
summer
beer
a
dark
amber
hue
with
a
white
head
it
had
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
but
it
was
a
bit
faint
in
the
taste
it
was
a
sweet
malt
that
ended
with
a
gingerbread
cookie
aftertaste
interesting
but
a
bit
sweet
for
me
on
a
regular
basis
very
drinkable
and
a
typical
creme
ale
good
representation
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
copper
red
color
as
promised
with
a
decent
amount
of
heads
which
fades
to
a
consistent
coating
across
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
rather
balanced
malt
hops
and
spice
all
sort
of
meld
together
more
and
more
im
noticing
mouthfeel
before
flavor
it
is
a
bit
watery
but
rather
effervescent
and
pleasant
simultaneously
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
and
not
really
all
that
great
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
all
that
drinkable
and
i
dont
believe
ill
be
having
this
again
d
goes
down
smooth
a
very
interesting
beer
very
well
suited
for
the
summer
months
not
too
quaffable
for
a
hot
day
but
definately
good
to
try
one
gorgeous
ruby
redamber
color
two
finger
head
dissipates
leaving
a
ring
with
some
clouds
smell
is
faintly
creamy
and
malty
the
flavor
is
like
boont
light
caramel
vanilla
and
toffee
no
real
hop
presence
until
the
end
mouthfeel
is
satisfying
and
a
little
less
sticky
than
its
big
brother
anderson
valley
has
a
summer
beer
and
its
called
poleeko
gold
i
love
av
and
i
expected
more
from
this
than
watered
down
boont
good
session
brew
unexpected
and
not
very
much
something
i
might
go
for
on
hot
day
but
then
again
a
good
alternative
to
the
usual
summer
offerings
d
excellent
drinkability
definite
session
best
cream
ale
i
have
ever
had
fairly
drinkable
i
may
get
tired
of
this
brew
after
a
few
but
very
much
worth
trying
and
appreciating
overall
impression
drinks
like
iced
tea
easy
going
refreshing
fun
beer
its
a
shame
that
it
arrived
so
late
in
texas
were
closer
to
the
winter
solstice
than
the
summer
at
this
point
but
im
glad
to
see
it
anyway
a
nice
summer
ale
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
lasting
white
head
nose
is
of
citrusy
malts
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
sweet
maltiness
with
no
pronounced
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
as
the
name
implies
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
not
a
bad
effort
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
medium
heft
of
a
body
mild
in
alcoholic
content
yet
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
overall
impression
nice
beer
not
sure
about
it
as
a
summer
seasonal
though
i
guess
it
is
nice
to
have
a
bit
of
variety
out
there
but
this
is
a
bit
thicker
than
i
would
have
expected
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
its
nutty
with
caramel
overtones
and
a
nice
lingering
finish
would
definitely
drink
again
another
good
beer
from
anderson
valley
keep
up
the
good
work
i
only
had
a
couple
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
drank
another
one
if
available

just
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
appears
an
amber
color
cream
hued
head
quite
surprising
for
a
cream
ale
head
forms
thick
and
leaves
even
lacing
down
the
pint
glass
aroma
has
some
eviden
corn
and
cooked
veggies
with
mild
grassy
hop
character
and
caramel
malt
presence
as
well
taste
is
quality
nice
caramel
amber
malts
mix
of
corn
sweetness
light
grassy
hop
finish
very
tasty
and
not
overbearing
in
any
way
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
very
smooth
with
somewhat
notable
texture
drinkability
is
great
compared
to
my
past
experiences
with
the
style
but
anderson
valley
decided
to
add
some
specialty
malts
thank
the
beer
gods
this
pours
a
a
dark
orange
with
a
large
tan
head
the
smell
is
weakbut
i
could
make
out
an
earthy
floral
aroma
along
with
a
malt
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
creaminess
to
it
thats
nice
other
flavors
include
bread
yeast
sweet
malt
and
some
hop
bitterness
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
making
this
a
differentbut
good
beer
cheers
d
good
here
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
hammering
a
few
of
these
back
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
tea
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
sweet
bread
aromas
fruity
strawberry
vanilla
apple
and
caremel
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
the
flavor
presents
a
rather
curious
sour
malt
nuance
and
while
not
necessarily
unpleasant
neither
is
it
anticipated
what
ultimately
makes
it
drinkable
is
the
dry
crisp
turn
at
the
end
letting
the
palate
breathe
a
bit
after
the
acidic
foray
like
other
av
beers
this
one
too
will
disappear
from
my
fridge
but
unlike
the
others
this
one
will
take
some
time
longer
pours
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
displays
good
lacing
in
my
glass
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
some
caramel
and
pretty
much
no
bitterness
taste
is
thick
and
mouthfilling
with
the
malts
covering
the
mouth
and
going
down
really
smooth
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
a
little
heavy
for
summer
id
say
but
nonetheless
easily
sessionable
d
well
its
a
summer
beer
so
know
what
you
are
getting
bit
sweet
and
cloying
for
a
hot
day
not
refreshing
enough
i
prefer
its
winter
counterpart
much
more
this
beer
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
its
taste
is
also
sweet
with
aftertaste
of
caramel
candy
and
orange
rind
its
strong
in
carbonation
would
have
one
or
two
of
these
but
not
really
a
session
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
solid
brew
this
beer
poured
with
a
small
head
the
color
is
similar
to
a
rich
pale
ale
the
smell
is
fruity
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
goood
there
is
a
hoppiness
to
it
and
also
hints
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
probably
the
best
summer
type
beer
i
have
had
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
surprisingly
good
summer
quencher
just
like
the
back
label
describes
i
adore
the
nose
on
this
one
quite
a
lot
the
tartness
and
spice
flavor
reminds
me
of
petrus
christmas
ale
which
pleasantly
surprised
me
i
could
see
myself
polishing
off
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
ale
demonstrates
the
versatility
craftsmanship
and
quality
of
this
fine
brewery
a
good
ale
for
sure
though
this
is
a
unique
brew
i
dont
think
i
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
the
flavor
just
doesnt
say
beer
to
me
pours
a
light
brown
with
orange
highlights
topped
by
a
halfinch
of
creamy
white
head
that
disippates
in
about
a
minute
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
allspice
clove
and
vanilla
palate
is
a
medium
malt
profile
with
a
slight
metallic
tinge
and
a
hint
of
hops
accompanied
by
some
mellow
spices
mainly
vanilla
and
clove
body
is
actually
a
little
thicker
than
i
like
in
a
cream
ale
but
not
too
much
to
handle
a
tasty
brew
much
more
interesting
than
i
was
expecting
however
it
is
just
a
bit
too
heavy
to
be
the
summer
thirst
quencher
it
purports
to
be
d
tough
to
get
down
cuz
of
all
the
flavors
randomly
bombarding
your
tongue
drinkability
high
cheers
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
best
creme
ales
ive
had
a
fave
brewery
delivers
again
wow
what
a
fullbody
for
a
summer
beer
the
moutfeel
is
incredibly
creamy
and
full
and
i
could
not
imagine
having
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
the
taste
is
mild
english
malty
backbone
with
a
hint
of
fruity
hopiness
overall
there
is
not
much
here
very
easy
to
drink
beer
will
be
something
to
serve
on
warm
summer
days
and
drink
happily
beats
most
other
cerveza
style
brews
out
there
certainly
a
drinkable
light
cream
ale
could
have
used
a
bit
more
flavor
though
d
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
while
maintaining
more
flavor
than
typical
summers
brews
this
is
like
drinking
the
beer
version
of
a
cream
soda
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
great
after
a
hot
day
to
have
one
or
two
but
not
sure
about
its
session
beer
potential
ontap
at
coles
hazy
copper
with
a
moderate
but
dense
yellowednewsprint
head
much
darker
than
expected
aromas
are
very
subtle
but
what
i
pick
up
are
caramel
vanilla
and
sicklysweet
soured
malts
not
exactly
appetizing
but
interesting
nonetheless
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
in
a
cloying
or
overpowering
way
absolutely
no
hops
to
speak
of
yet
i
would
not
call
this
a
maltbomb
there
is
a
certain
nuttiness
and
that
same
bowlofwaterandbarleythatgotleftoutinthesuntoolong
characteristic
that
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
at
the
finish
there
is
a
distinctly
vanilla
creamsoda
flavor
that
brings
it
home
and
the
toasty
malt
aftertaste
ties
it
all
together
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
expected
but
still
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
make
you
pay
attention
creamy
as
well
of
course
super
drinkable
nice
summer
brew
cant
wait
to
pick
up
a
sixer
when
they
arrive
out
here
this
beer
pours
like
a
20
year
old
scotch
its
color
seems
to
give
it
more
gravity
then
is
possible
the
appearance
is
like
a
cousins
bbq
clear
with
a
hint
of
fog
on
the
way
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
well
let
me
just
say
that
it
reminds
me
of
the
honeymoon
that
i
have
yet
to
have
the
taste
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
kind
of
speak

themselves

my
taste
buds
screaming
for
more
buy
this
beer
drink
this
beer
as
often
as
you
can
it
is
worth
it
d
have
had
up
to
3
bottles
at
one
sitting
a
local
pub
had
it
on
tap
recently
and
my
wife
and
split
equally
a
60
oz
pitcher
between
us
quite
drinkable
though
after
a
while
the
allmaltnohop
character
tends
to
get
slightly
old
after
youve
had
30
oz
a
great
summer
beer
totally
refreshing
and
bursting
with
flavor
how
could
you
go
wrong
moderate
carbonation
mediumlight
bodied
good
alternative
to
the
always
refreshing
pilsener
or
hefeweizen
i
felt
this
was
a
great
blend
for
the
summer
im
excited
to
have
it
again
this
was
just
wonderful
it
was
delicious
smelled
great
and
was
really
easy
to
drink
i
will
look
for
this
again
ontap
pours
a
rich

good

body
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
taste
is
bready
and
malted
sweet
and
smooth
from
start
to
finish
good
beer
but
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
notes
its
ok
but
not
one
ill
pursue
it
has
some
cake
likeness
to
it
that
just
doesnt
fit
my
palate
overall
nothing
special
here
a
surprise
from
anderson
valley
a
beer
to
try
but
i
wont
be
drinking
again
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
you
could
quaff
a
6er
no
problem
and
cruise
thru
a
stiflingly
warm
sacramento
summer
in
style
i
hope
for
this
beers
sake
that
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
this
is
a
nice
summer
brew
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
crisp
and
dry
summer
offerings
not
quite
a
lawnmower
beer
its
more
of
a
beer
you
would
drink
in
the
warm
evning
after
the
mowing
is
done
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
wheat
pears
and
seems
to
have
some
toastiness
in
there
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
a
little
spicy
at
the
front
followed
by
some
sweetness
and
caramel
flavors
from
the
malt
toffee
comes
to
mind
quite
tasty
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
thanks
beerbeing
drinkability
and
notes

definitely
has
a
thicker
body
tan
a
lot
of
summer
beers
but
still
super
drinkable
for
my
second
homebrew
we
made
a
cream
ale
with
vanilla
that
was
nowhere
near
as
good
as
this
so
i
appreciate
this
beer
a
lot
notes
unusual
brew
very
sweet
and
velvetty
smooth
a
very
solid
and
tasty
beer
i
got
one
bottle
as
part
of
a
sampler
pack
and
have
not
been
able
to
find
this
wonderful
beer
since
it
pours
a
nice
reddishorange
color
with
a
thick
head
smell
is
sweet
a
little
caramel
or
sugar
and
vanilla
my
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
marshmallows
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
though
and
balanced
well
with
malty
undertones
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
a
great
cream
ale
one
i
wish
was
available
on
the
east
coast
drinkability
over
the
past
few
months
this
beer
has
become
a
staple
in
our
household
i
figured
by
now
i
should
write
a
review
on
one
of
my
favorite
daily
drinkers
this
beer
pairs
well
with
grilled
foods
fish
and
pasta
all
around
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
well
balanced
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
crisp
but
also
full
bodied
enough
to
pair
with
stronger
flavors
well
done
well
this
beer
is
an
example
of
that
it
is
such
an
easydrinking
smooth
nonaggressive
beer
that
you
could
down
a
six
pack
especially
in
the
hot
summer
months
for
which
it
is
intended
in
no
time
it
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
coppery
color
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
light
honeyed
or
caramel
sweetness
that
indicates
the
light
roastiness
of
the
malts
and
enough
hoppiness
not
much
to
keep
the
beer
balanced
and
the
finish
dry
enough
to
want
another
sip
this
is
your
dads
beer
only
better
i
for
one
like
it
note
this
would
be
a
great
brew
to
start
converting
a
macro
swill
drinker
kudos
to
anderson
valley
for
the
vision
and
the
skill
to
pull
off
a
true
original
a
summertime
cream
ale
that
is
at
once
flavorful
interesting
and
sessionable
if
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
in
avs
distribution
area
summer
solstice
cerveza
crema
would
have
a
permanent
place
in
my
refrigerator
very
well
done
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
summer
seasonal
next
summer
i
hope
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
decent
session
beer
and
is
a
good
choice
as
a
beer
that
is
interesting
tasting
yet
still
a
safe
bet
for
those
bud
swillin
friends
that
are
scared
of
those
dark
beers
drinkability
is
ok
a
little
too
much
though
for
a
summer
brew
seems
like
this
is
the
winter
solstice
thats
been
watered
down
considerably
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
small
head
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
nice
malty
spicy
scents
theres
a
nice
sweet
taste
malty
with
some
orange
notes
medium
body
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
when
i
first
took
a
sip
i
knew
this
is
a
totally
different
kind
of
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
to
at
least
try
it
once
but
im
sure
you
will
try
it
again
and
again
summer
solstice
is
a
nice
name
for
this
smooth
clear
copper
colored
ale
poured
a
slight
head
which
had
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
scent
was
sweet
and
spicy
light
fruits
such
as
apples
and
pears
drink
it
cold
the
slight

malty

not
in
an
icky
way
i
dont
consider
this
a
refreshing
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
brew
pick
some
up
the
taste
was
a
sourtart
apple
flavor
with
spices
and
hops
only
when
really
cold
did
i
get
this
taste
when
warming
in
the
glass
the
flavor
turned
to
an
uninteresting
spicey
sour
taste
with
not
much
flavor
you
have
to
drink
this
beer
cold
rusty
amber
darkespecially
for
a
summer

i
say
good

interesting

overall
lovely
i
may
venture
to
go
the
whole
hog
and
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
one
quite
the
tasty

superb

not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
summer
brew
a
bit
too
thick
and
creamy
malty
to
be
a
summer
session
beer
i
could
really
see
enjoying
this
more
on
a
cool
fall
afternoon
or
in
the
spring
after
drinking
imperial
stouts
and
barleywines
all
winter
this
is
not
as
boring
as
most
summer
beers
just
doesnt
fit
with
me
in
the
heat
this
beer
was
amazing
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
summer
beer
and
how
avb
makes
there
seasonals
usually
a
little
darker
and
with
a
lot
of
spices
this
beer
when
poured
into
a
glass
was
an
darker
amber
color
with
little
head
had
the
taste
of
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
keep
making
this
beer
drinkability
is
ok
not
bad
hell
never
having
a
cream
ale
before
it
might
be
the
best
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
style
i
dont
see
myself
trying
to
find
again
drinkable
i
suppose
i
can
really
see
this
being
a
good
picnic
beer
something
to
take
to
the
beach
with
the
hot
dogs
and
chips
i
had
two
nonbeer
drinkers
in
the
room
who
normally
find
my
ipas
or
strong
ales
much
too
aggressive
and
both
pronounced
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
so
it
may
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
people
unfamiliar
with
craft
brews
as
a
summer
type
thirst
quencher
this
would
be
a
good
one
you
wouldnt
think
so
after
pouring
it
but
its
so
damn
smooth
and
silky
drinkability
is
off
the
scale
this
is
one
damn
tasty
beer
assertive
in
all
respects
without
being
tiring
best
beer
i
has
tasted
all
year
this
one
cost
me
10
for
the
six
pack
and
it
is
worth
every
penny
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
one
finger
fizzylike
head
that
is
gone
pretty
quickly
leaving
no
lace
behindlighter
aromas
on
the
malty
side
a
touch
of
roastiness
and
some
nuts
in
there
as
well
malt
dominated
flavors
lightly
sweet
even
more
so
in
the
finish
pretty
grainy
and
lighter
in
the
mouthfeel
department
there
is
a
spice
in
this
brew
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
oniam
thinking
vanilla
the
more
i
drink
but
not
quite
sure
a
pretty
good
offering
and
highly
drinkable
good
for
the
summer
months
for
sure
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
is
sweet
with
a
light
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
sweet
and
creamy
it
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
some
light
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
great
also
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
excellent
beer
whats
not
to
like
it
goes
well
with
hot
or
cold
climates
a
good
drinker
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
summer
quaffer
i
took
no
time
at
all
polishing
off
the
single
i
bought
enjoyable
this
unique
creamy
and
lightly
sweet
copper
colored
ale
has
a
beautiful
longlasting
head
that
leaves
wide
splashes
and
streaks
of
lace
about
the
glass
its
charming
enticing
wonderful
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
strawberry
shortcake
and
its
perfectly
suited
for
a
summer
beer
in
the
mouth
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
creamy
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
the
just
lightly
tingles
the
tongue
the
flavor
delivers
a
sweet
bed
of
vanillacookielike
malt
that
has
just
a
hint
of
caramel
to
it
and
a
delicate
yeasty
fruitiness
thats
reminiscent
of
strawberries
its
lowlevel
bitterness
barely
appears
and
its
just
sweet
enough
to
satisfy
without
becoming
candyish
it
finishes
drying
with
some
residual
fruitiness
and
a
lingering
note
of
vanilla
simply
put
wonderful
this
beer
has
a
subtle
resemblance
to
its
cousin
winter
solstice
the
copper
coloring
and
tint
give
a
smell
of
wheaty
caramel
and
toasted
honey
the
taste
is
that
of
creamy
sweet
spicy
velvet
its
bit
heavier
than
the
usual
summer
brew
but
oh
so
drinkable
i
cant
think
of
anything
better
on
a
hot
lazy
summer
day
a
tasty
switch
from
the
usual
pale
summer
brews
possibly
my
new
favorite
anderson
valley
brew
as
it
boasts
all
of
the
good
things
of
an
esb
without
and
of
the
shortcomings
way
over
the
top
on
the
cream
soda
vanilla
taste
and
way
against
expectations
a
summer
seasonal
beer
shouldnt
be
this
dark
reading
the
title
i
think
a
light
cream
ale
like
a
creamy
mexicanstlye
lager
and
definitely
not
something
this
overpowering
in
taste
and
this
heavy
could
barely
get
this
down
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
my
first
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
like
drinking
the
beer
version
of
cream
soda
the
beer
is
fairly
light
on
the
palate
with
a
finish
that
has
a
carbonic
bite
to
it
i
really
do
like
the
soda
analogy
for
this
beer
i
am
reminded
of
both
a
light
rootbeer
and
a
cream
soda
caramel
popcorn
would
also
be
an
apt
flavor
analogy
i
am
really
curious
as
to
what
the
spices
were
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
definitely
and
interesting
beer
to
try
though
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
want
more
of
it
i
love
cream
soda
and
this
is
cream
soda
in
beer
form
appearance
is
nice
dark
copper
but
with
little
head
smell
is
malty
and
vanilla
inviting
taste
is
malt
nad
vanilla
very
smooth
with
slight
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
hint
of
dryness
in
the
finish
smooth
on
the
palate
good
drinkability
the
beer
evacuates
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
crystal
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
modest
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
evaporates
rather
quickly
leaving
a
fine
covering
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
hints
of
caramel
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
start
is
sweet
with
a
fair
to
middling
grain
presence
and
the
top
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
as
a
pleasant
acidity
with
the
hops
pleasing
in
their
spiciness
aftertaste

and
a
nice
beer

this
hot

ah
nice
kick
of

vanilla
upfront
encompassing
my

the
middle
brings
out
the
vanilla
even
more
by
being
balanced
out
against
a
black
peppery
hop
profile
and
some
soft
malt
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
powder

the
vanilla
is
all
played

read
boring

from

i
never
used
to
be
much
of
a
seasonal
summer
beer
fan
but
it
seems
more
breweries
these
days
have
been
able
to
strike
the
balance
between
flavor
drinkability
and
refreshment
than
ever
before
the
boonville
addition
is
certainly
one
of
them
drinkability
i
would
have
taken
this
brew
over
just
about
all
of
them
if
it
was
available
when
i
was
in
cancun
last
october
different
tasty
and
refreshing

buttery
and

quite
the
same
very
smooth
and
rich
i
tend
to
enjoy
these
pub
ales
more
than
the
next
guy
unless
that
guy
is
a
brit
or
irishman
fantastic
smooth
creamy
head
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
then
pub
ale
blah
reminded
me
on
genes
see
not
cool
the
downside
is
very
artificial
flavour
aspects
and
little
aroma
sweet
flavor
nice
bite
actually
recognizable
for
a
cream
ale
outstanding
cream
ale
almost
tastes
like
butterscotch
at
first
perfect
for
all
irish
holidays
dont
tell
your
friends
its
english
made
the
flavor
profile
is
reasonably
intense
not
complex
and
is
poorly
balanced
it
begins
with
a
nonsweet
caramel
note
that
is
almost
covered
by
grainy
undertones
the
middle
is
slightly
bitter
and
has
an
earthy
hop
flavor
that
seems
stale
the
finish
is
slightly
astringent
and
that
stale
hop
flavor
lingers
stale
hop
flavor
dominates
this
one
and
not
in
a
good
way
wexford
is
beyond
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
watching
this
beer
cascade
is
just
beautiful
definitely
a
new
favorite
beautiful
pour
light
brown
with
a
reddish
gold
hue
and
extremely
dense
creamy
head
which
is
to
be
expected
with
these
draft
pour
type
nitro
cans
reasonably
good
malt
nose
and
flavor
but
definitely
not
meant
to
overwhelm
anyones
palate
okay
well
say
bland
obviously
intended
to
be
a
pub
drink
that
can
be
knocked
back
for
a
while
at
5
this
is
a
little
more
substantial
than
some
other
similar
offerings
but
it
still
lacks
flavor
and
mouthfeel
disappointing
although
i
wasnt
expecting
much
to
begin
with
the
pour
and
nose
made
me
think
it
might
be
better
than
it
was
this
is
just
not
a
good
beer
i
cant
place
the
taste
that
it
reminds
me
of
just
kinda
sweet
watered
down
and
just
no
its
an
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
but
different
it
came
in
a
nice
can
i
like
the
cans
appearance
its
golden
in
color
with
very
little
head
i
might
have
kept
it
in
the
freezer
too
long
had
a
little
ice
roughy
an
hour
and
a
half
it
had
very
little
smell
taste
is
decent
expected
more
from
a
creme
ale
not
bad
though
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
i
used
to
drink
this
one
a
lot
but
it
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
much
as
it
did
10
years
ago
changing
palate
i
presume
it
tastes
nice
but
it
is
a
bit
too
bland
and
sweet
but
not
necessarily
with
a
big
drinkability
anyway
worth
trying
overall
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
bland
great
appearance
and
feel
but
the
flavor
needs
a
little
tweaking
love
how
this
nitrogen
pour
beer
goes
from
cloudy
white
to
a
golem
colored
beer
you
can
see
this
unpasteurized
beer
with
good
carbonation
a
good
half
inch
thick
head
of
foam
with
smalltightly
packed
carbonation
bubbles
light
cereal
grain
aroma
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
chalky
and
theres
a
sweetness
that
seems
out
of
place
in
the
beer
theres
a
faint
cereal
grain
flavor
that
diminishes
rapidly
the
memory
of
this
beer
is
better
than
this
i
love
this
beer
and
its
one
of
the
ones
i
keep
constantly
stocked
at
the
house
served
in
a
can
that
kept
the
beer
very
well
lets
out
a
satisfying
froth
and
hiss
when
opening
amber
in
color
a
very
smooth
beer
sweet
earthy
flavors
with
a
very
very
light
bite
at
the
very
end
when
swallowing
keeps
a
very
strong
frothy
head
for
a
long
time
during
drinking
the
exact
opposite
of
a
bitter
ipa
o
the
nitrocan
turns
an
ordinary
english
ale
into
an
interesting
beerone
that
has
a
particularly
pleasing
mouthfeel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
found
this
one
to
be
real
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
though
this
is
a
style
i
likely
enjoy
more
than
a
lot
of
other
folks
using
this
site
i
like
the
bitterness
towards
the
finish
that
lingers
pairs
well
with
snack
foods
while
watching
football
this
sunday
afternoon
just
not
much
here
to
talk
about
pretty
bland
the
wexford
irish
crème
ale
is
decent
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
u
s
based
beers
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
finger
thick
foamy
head
which
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
is
dull
with
english
noble
hops
being
present
the
taste
is
a
smooth
creamy
flare
with
not
a
lot
going
on
definite
malt
presents
with
some
hops
for
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
and
flat
overall
it
is
ok
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
huge
head
and
plenty
of
thick
lacing
nose
is
an
unpleasant
combination
of
dish
soap
and
sour
wood
flavor
is
bready
with
a
slight
hop
and
slight
hint
of
indistinct
sweetness
rubberlike
bittersweet
finish
overall
this
is
not
a
great
quaff
this
is
a
mild
beer
but
its
a
pleasant
one
with
structure
and
with
interest
its
also
extremely
accessible
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
yes
its
not
going
to
wow
you
with
flavour
but
for
what
is
presumably
a
pretty
massproduced
english
ale
theres
a
lot
to
like
this
is
a
decent
gateway
beer
and
in
my
opinion
better
than
the
typical
massproduced
offerings
it
has
enough
character
to
be
interesting
yet
is
reserved
enough
to
be
enjoyed
after
a
frustrating
day
of
work
o
not
a
good
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
it
but
then
again
it
might
be
nice
as
a
cold
pint
at
a
pub
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
rich
crystal
clear
caramel
coloring
with
a
great
cascade
on
the
pour
and
a
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
of
about
a
half
an
inch
that
doesnt
budge
aromas
of
buttercream
sweetness
and
roast
very
rich
flavors
are
light
and
roasty
on
a
thin
smooth
body
toasted
grain
and
subtle
creamy
sweet
blend
together
well
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
very
end
to
clean
everything
up
flavors
end
up
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
very
drinkable
tangy
sweet
aftertase
with
a
slightly
cloying
dry
finish
final
thoughts
im
a
huge
fan
of
boddingtons
pub
ale
but
for
some
reason
wexfords
nitrocan
irish
cream
ale
doesnt
do
the
trick
for
me
its
just
a
little
to
heavy
in
body
and
too
sweet
would
i
drink
it
again
eh
nope
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
rjt
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
dense
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
slight
caramel
and
a
metallic
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
but
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
its
best
aspect
is
the
appearance
in
my
opinion
pours
a
burnt
amber
color
with
a
handsome
crown
of
rich
delicate
irish
foam
thick
patches
of
lacing
cling
gracefully
to
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
but
clean
and
palatable
smelling
of
caramel
with
the
slightest
balance
of
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
slightly
acidic
reminiscent
of
apple
juice
laced
with
caramel
with
absolutely
no
carbonation
whatsoever
it
may
be
possible
that
ive
tasted
a
flatter
beer
but
nothing
comes
to
mind
offhand
mild
bitterness
can
be
detected
in
the
finish
but
the
whole
affair
is
far
from
what
id
consider
balanced
the
caramel
and
apple
juice
waver
back
and
forth
on
the
palate
with
little
else
to
wrest
ones
attention
the
presentation
of
this
brew
was
excellent
but
the
flat
onedimensional
flavor
just
doesnt
back
it
up
overall
it
is
lackluster
the
beer
has
a
somewhat
flat
taste
which
gives
it
a
lower
rating
from
me
if
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
stronger
i
think
i
would
enjoy
it
much
more
overall
the
taste
is
smooth
and
not
bitter
with
no
real
after
taste
or
lingering
effect
it
does
have
a
really
beautiful
red
color
to
it
which
gives
it
a
great
look
minus
any
real
head
at
all
overall
i
would
say
a
2
5
but
it
is
not
terrible
and
would
not
be
so
bad
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
i
couldnt
really
get
into
this
bottom
line
tasted
a
little
to
much
like
church
wine
for
me
almost
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
beer
by
the
end
of
it
o
i
couldnt
get
the
thoughts
of
creamy
apple
juice
out
of
my
mind
while
drinking
this
the
metallic
presence
was
definitely
a
turn
off
on
this
one
but
the
easy
drinkability
makes
this
a
decent
beer
o
i
docked
it
for
the
metallic
taste
i
got
in
early
sips
but
this
beer
is
actually
pretty
good
good
god
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
in
ages
and
im
thankful
i
havent
had
anything
nearly
as
bad
that
i
can
recall
in
recent
memory
the
beer
looks
awesome
but
it
tastes
like
a
malty
mess
with
minimal
bitter
tones
and
hardly
enough
hop
influence
its
just
bleh
nasty
this
one
is
going
down
the
drain
would
recommend
obviously
not
a
lifechanging
beer
however
it
is
very
sessionable
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
four
pack
of
this
while
outdoors
watching
some
sports
on
tv
or
even
just
chilling
with
friends
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
you
rave
about
just
the
kind
you
enjoy
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
o
i
probably
wouldnt
try
this
beer
again
but
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
and
the
joy
i
get
out
of
watching
the
bubbles
due
to
the
nitro
can
makes
up
for
its
mediocrity
o
keep
swirling
it
as
you
go
like
us
it
loses
a
lot
without
its
head
o
pretty
onedimensional
but
good
for
what
it
is
very
easy
and
fun
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
foamy
caramel
color
with
a
billowing
rolling
head
its
aroma
is
of
pineapple
with
a
hint
of
milk
the
flavor
has
notes
of
butterscotch
and
thick
heavy
cream
with
an
acidic
slightly
sour
finish
the
mouthfeel
it
thick
and
creamy
like
whipped
cream
wexford
irish
cream
ale
isnt
a
real
good
beer
not
recommended
3
5
d
not
a
big
fan
of
nitro
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
overall
a
super
creamy
and
decently
flavorful
ale
one
that
i
will
most
likely
enjoy
next
st
pattys
day
taste
it
has
that
creamy
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
fruits
and
a
slight
bitterness
the
creaminess
balances
out
any
bitterness
this
has
like
guinness
this
gives
the
impression
of
it
being
heavier
then
it
really
is
not
that
that
is
bad
if
you
cant
stand
a
nitro
can
stay
away
i
do
love
a
nice
ipa
and
this
is
the
exact
opposite
of
an
ipa
but
i
loved
it
but
isnt
that
the
great
thing
about
craft
beer
the
different
tastes
and
mouth
feels
that
span
the
spectrum
this
stuff
is
actually
pretty
descent
been
to
wexford
not
going
back
overall
not
bad
drinkable
no
harm
in
having
it
but
probably
wont
grab
another
one
in
the
future
this
doesnt
grab
my
attention
very
much
so
this
beer
is
far
from
profound
still
enjoyed
it
more
than
most
apparently
but
not
as
much
as
other
nitro
cans
such
as
youngs
chocolate
or
even
tetleys
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
this
kind
of
thing
could
use
more
carbonation
feels
a
bit
slick
fruity
slight
bitter
aftertaste
i
liked
this
fairly
well
thanks
to
the
nitro
the
pour
and
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
stoutlike
though
in
reality
much
lighter
bronzed
amber
in
color
cascading
nitrocarbonation
with
a
finger
of
creamy
white
head
when
all
settled
sweet
malts
in
the
nose
caramel
popcorn
taste
of
toasted
grains
corn
sweet
malts
light
notes
of
peach
and
apple
skin
giving
a
bitter
quality
with
a
definite
earthy
hoppiness
mid
to
endpalate
medium
mouthfeel
thickness
from
the
nitro
is
an
illusion
but
still
works
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
this
one
pours
a
very
murky
honey
cream
gold
in
color
that
eventually
settles
down
to
a
very
clear
and
rich
gold
in
color
the
aromas
consist
of
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
and
toffee
sweetness
its
pretty
appealing
the
flavors
are
very
watery
you
get
a
moderate
amount
of
sweet
toffee
esque
malt
with
an
ever
so
light
bitter
finish
the
watery
aspect
nitro
can
or
not
really
takes
away
from
the
potential
flavor
it
needs
to
be
fuller
in
body
and
perhaps
a
bit
richer
its
very
very
light
in
body
and
the
nitro
can
actually
takes
away
from
the
beer
it
started
off
pretty
well
then
quickly
went
downhill
i
can
see
how
drinking
it
would
be
easy
though
overall
not
too
shabby
flawed
like
the
dickens
but
that
is
ok
this
isnt
perfect
brew
a
bit
too
sweet
and
caramel
covered
for
a
traditional
bitter
if
you
can
see
past
that
point
youll
be
ok
with
this
one
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
most
people
not
a
bad
taste
great
mouth
feel
i
would
purchase
again
o
its
not
bad
but
i
think
that
there
are
better
nitro
beers
out
there
overall
drinkability
first
of
the
style
ive
had
i
believe
so
im
rating
as
a
beer
or
at
least
to
analogues
rather
than
in
the
specific
style
very
creamy
smooth
with
no
bite
or
sharpness
makes
a
great
desert
beer
i
like
the
flavor
it
has
some
mild
malt
and
light
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
the
main
flavor
influence
is
the
yeast
which
gives
a
slight
fruitiness
and
hint
of
caramel
the
overall
drinkability
is
good
as
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
pretty
average
for
the
style
o
cant
recommend
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
do
much
well
overall
im
not
impressed
im
always
happy
to
try
a
new
beer
especially
one
considered
a
classic
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
again
overall
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
i
find
myself
seeking
it
out
in
any
specialty
beer
store
i
normally
hate
nitrobeers
guinness
murphys
boddingtons
but
for
this
beer
i
couldnt
have
it
any
other
way
its
a
cream
ale
and
meant
to
be
enjoyed
that
way
as
pure
uncarbonated
heady
cream
body
is
creamy
and
full
oddly
bitter
grainy
and
harsh
some
sweetness
on
the
front
overall
weak
and
nasty
people
drink
this
beer
i
dont
like
it
at
all
opretty
good
i
have
only
had
a
few
cream
ales
and
i
do
enjoy
the
style
its
subtle
very
creamy
and
looks
delicious
enjoyable
brew
pass
this
beer
was
pretty
cool
i
loved
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
nitro
can
similar
to
a
guinness
the
pours
was
awesome
on
this
brew
it
was
just
like
watching
the
pour
of
any
other
nitro
brew
but
its
always
amazes
me
the
color
of
beer
is
a
light
copper
color
with
a
very
creamy
white
head
the
lacing
sticks
nicely
to
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
subtle
some
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
and
a
few
other
fresh
grains
the
taste
is
a
bit
weak
but
gives
off
a
good
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
it
worth
trying
i
think
im
glad
i
did
for
sure
o
although
a
nice
beer
i
found
this
ale
to
be
empty
on
flavor
but
full
on
mouthfeel
and
appearance
too
little
hop
flavorinvolvement
intriguing
was
the
fruit
notes
im
impressed
with
this
beer
great
dessert
beer
overall
i
am
afraid
this
one
was
a
disappointment
all
around
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
not
very
complex
either
i
can
certainly
drink
this
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
any
in
the
near
future
o
smells
nice
but
the
flavor
was
pretty
disappointing
dont
know
if
id
be
interested
in
having
this
again
thanks
to
illudiumq36
for
the
sample
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
youll
likely
enjoy
this
brew
the
nitrogen
infusion
really
makes
for
a
smooth
texture
and
soft
finish
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
this
to
be
an
all
that
drinkable
brew
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
something
that
would
go
well
with
a
heavy
dinner
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
outside
of
that
o
a
brew
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
and
may
try
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
in
a
pub
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
in
a
nitrocan
3
5
drinkability
overall
high
marks
for
appearance
but
what
lies
under
the
appearance
is
not
great
maybe
there
is
reason
this
recipe
from
1810
was
left
in
1810
it
didnt
quite
work
well
with
the
meal
i
had
porkchops
and
snappeas
but
maybe
with
the
right
meal
it
would
work
no
one
is
enough
i
cant
see
having
more
neat
to
try
for
the
appearance
and
the
fun
of
a
nitrocan
but
thats
it
poured
a
bubbley
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
on
it
aroma
is
not
real
strong
some
malt
maybe
some
honey
to
it
taste
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
very
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
didnt
really
care
for
it
light
bodied
beer
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
worth
a
try
on
st
paddys
day
but
i
probably
wont
look
for
it
again
d
super
simple
super
drinkable
almost
too
light
is
my
only
real
complaint
however
i
know
this
is
supposed
to
the
status
quo
as
far
as
english
bitters
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
prefer
this
to
anyother
in
this
style
that
ive
had
would
gladly
pick
up
regularly
overall
a
good
english
cream
ale
that
comes
from
ireland
i
dont
understand
the
decent
reviews
but
this
is
a
great
beer
to
try
ddespite
my
initial
reaction
i
did
finish
this
i
noticed
with
this
one
the
trick
is
to
drink
it
quickly
not
focusing
on
the
tastes
really
helps
this
flavor
its
actually
not
a
bad
drinker
d
i
suppose
sitting
around
one
could
fairly
easily
drink
several
of
these
although
its
not
one
to
really
sit
there
and
think
about
or
really
enjoy
i
have
3more
nitrocans
and
suppose
ill
finish
them
off
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
maybe
one
will
be
used
to
make
a
loaf
of
beer
bread
wow
this
beer
was
a
huge
disappointment
from
the
pour
what
a
beautiful
start
but
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
wont
be
going
back
very
soon
pours
a
clear
slightly
hazy
brownish
color
with
a
two
finger
nitro
can
head
and
leaveslittle
or
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
butteriness
the
taste
is
of
toastiness
and
caramel
malt
with
a
little
breadiness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
common
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
okay
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
it
and
its
an
easy
drink
but
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
want
more
either
d
i
prefer
a
more
quaffable
brew
in
this
style
there
are
more
flavorful
bitters
in
the
3
5
to
4
0
range
this
has
some
nostalgic
flair
for
me
so
i
appreciate
it
in
that
respect
that
said
its
an
enjoyable
smooth
beer
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
but
would
definitely
be
sessionable
id
really
like
to
try
it
on
cask
sometime
poured
from
can
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
dense
2
finger
white
head
that
results
in
a
thick
milky
lacing
the
nose
is
caramel
malt
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
caramel
cream
and
light
hops
full
creamy
body
not
much
going
on
in
this
one
but
an
easy
drinker
and
very
smooth
and
creamy
classic
irish
cream
ale
here
creamy
mouthfeel
as
expected
but
its
not
really
one
i
would
repeat
often
its
a
fine
line
for
me
when
it
comes
to
these
nitromellowed
beers
and
im
a
beer
drinker
who
usually
likes
less
carbonation
than
more
in
the
end
it
tastes
okay
but
the
delivery
of
the
taste
just
isnt
my
thing
worth
trying
anyway
no
doubt
440ml
widget
can
after
it
all
settles
down
it
is
a
plain
copper
coloured
ale
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
mainlly
malty
cereal
slightly
toasted
taste
i
rather
the
same
as
the
aroma
faint
toasted
cereal
like
maltiness
pretty
nice
on
the
palate
nothing
bad
slight
bitterness
at
then
end
overall
a
average
smooth
drinking
ale
i
was
very
disappointed
with
wexford
irish
cream
ale
this
beer
certainly
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
this
beer
poured
from
the
nitrocan
as
a
pale
yellowish
color
the
smell
is
inviting
but
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
smell
in
my
opinion
i
didnt
think
the
flavor
of
this
beer
offered
very
much
but
its
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
there
are
better
options
out
there
a
very
full
beer
taste
is
rather
simple
but
the
thickness
of
this
beer
and
good
balance
makes
it
a
solid
choice
d
this
is
a
good
session
beer
had
it
ontap
at
an
irish
pub
in
chicago
area
served
by
irish
and
british
bartenders
just
off
the
boat
back
in
1998
i
wanted
to
revisit
it
again
12
years
later
still
really
enjoy
this
brew
i
think
love
caffreys
over
this
but
this
is
a
close
2nd
definitely
a
beer
i
love
to
come
back
to
one
of
the
first
nonbmc
beers
i
ever
tried
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
absolutely
love
it
i
hope
to
drink
more
in
the
future
looks
a
smooth
dark
golden
color
with
a
beautiful
nitro
head
smells
of
caramel
and
heavy
cream
with
some
background
toasted
notes
plenty
of
lactose
and
coffee
notes
come
out
when
first
tasting
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
with
breakfast
food
lots
of
malts
and
a
bit
of
toasted
bread
at
the
end
hops
are
present
in
there
but
are
actually
quite
mild
feels
as
silky
smooth
as
you
could
expect
from
a
nitro
beer
borders
on
meal
in
a
can
but
some
of
that
could
be
the
heavy
meal
i
ate
with
it
would
still
make
a
fantastic
session
beer
aside
from
the
nitro
which
we
dont
mind
the
use
of
that
much
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
throw
this
against
a
plate
of
bangers
and
mash
heavenly
appearance
has
the
creamy
white
head
lifting
to
one
finger
thickness
giving
way
to
a
clear
copper
color
smell
is
light
with
caramel
sweetness
and
maybe
some
breadiness
taste
is
lightly
tinny
with
soft
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
medium
with
low
carbonation
that
makes
going
down
smooth
not
much
to
it
just
an
easy
going
creme
ale
pours
amber
with
a
reddish
tint
one
finger
of
nitrodriven
off
white
head
spicy
hops
dominate
the
nose
taste
seeks
briefly
to
start
with
a
malty

but
is
quickly
dominated
by
hop
bitterness
great
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
light
carbonation
drinkability
affected
within
a
very
short
time
as
the
edge
comes
off
all
qualities
of
the
brew
everything
nosetastemouthfeel
dulls
around
20
minutes
it
is
not
pricey
but
is
a
worthy
buy
drinkability
pretty
good
flavor
however
a
little
bit
lacking
in
the
hops
department
they
go
down
easy
enough
though
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
light
on
hops
or
more
appropriately
light
on
bitterness
the
lack
of
co2
in
nitro
beers
make
them
seem
less
bitter
quite
good
overall
a
let
down
in
the
most
important
part
taste
drinkable
but
not
great
overall
the
smell
and
appearance
were
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
was
underwhelming
worth
a
try
not
that
good
its
got
a
very
light
body
but
the
carbonation
from
the
nitro
is
fairly
nice
the
taste
is
really
odd
its
sweet
and
sharp
and
bready
i
guess
theres
a
bit
of
that
creaminess
to
it
but
its
fairly
covered
up
but
an
odd
alcohol
note
something
about
the
flavor
here
just
hits
me
wrong
it
is
just
an
average
beer
with
nothing
really
interesting
going
on
pretty
boring
and
not
very
appealing
d
deffinitly
a
session
if
found
at
a
decent
price
and
on
a
nitro
tap
this
ale
is
all
about
drinkability
while
a
bit
undistinguished
it
is
excellent
with
stereotypical
fried
pub
grub
i
guess
i
have
been
on
a
can
kick
of
late
decided
to
pick
up
some
of
this
the
other
night
can
has
the
widget
in
it
which
leads
to
a
nitro
like
pour
the
pour
produces
a
very
creamy
brew
with
a
thick
tan
head
of
foam
that
has
tiny
bubbles
after
the
cascade
up
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
slightly
muted
but
i
wonder
if
that
thick
head
is
blocking
a
lot
of
the
scents
from
reaching
my
nose
the
aroma
that
is
there
is
pale
malt
and
a
slight
fruit
scent
the
taste
is
good
just
also
seems
to
be
slightly
muted
malts
seem
to
be
the
most
noticeable
with
a
very
slight
hop
flavor
this
brew
drinks
quite
easily
just
for
me
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
character
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
very
creamy
as
you
would
expect
for
me
this
one
is
something
to
get
every
once
and
a
grey
moon
as
more
of
a
refresher
to
this
brew
d
tastes
good
cold
tastes
bad
warm
an
average
drinkability
rating
would
be
appropriate
i
suppose
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
a
bit
like
caramel
and
bread
there
is
also
yeast
and
some
grass
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
creamy
head
that
starts
out
nice
but
turns
out
to
be
thin
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
mild
bitterness
the
palate
is
smooth
from
the
nitro
widget
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
that
impressive
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
i
really
was
excited
about
it
when
i
bought
it
very
good
drinkability
its
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
it
goes
down
easy
good
session
beer
d
a
little
rough
at
first
but
this
beer
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
depending
on
my
mood
i
would
have
a
hard
time
having
more
than
two
in
a
single
sitting
d
went
down
like
water
much
better
st
paddys
choice
than
the
other
one
you
see
everywhere
conclusion
it
could
just
be
because
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
cream
ales
milk
stouts
etc
but
i
think
the
creamy
texture
and
taste
of
this
brew
is
totally
enchanting
recommended
b
d
one
of
the
worst
pints
ive
had
in
a
long
while
i
wasnt
able
to
finish
the
glass
and
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
im
not
keen
at
all
on
irish
brews
or
irish
style
brews
and
this
one
sure
isnt
anything
special
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
though
so
that
is
pretty
cool
obviously
nothing
special
but
sure
is
easy
to
drink
i
have
no
problem
at
all
with
this
easydrinking
beer
all
in
all
i
couldnt
have
been
more
pleased
with
this
beer
drinkability
overall
was
decent
at
2
something
a
can
i
will
steer
clear
for
awhile
but
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
can
while
approaching
march
so
you
know
at
the
very
least
i
had
a
fresh
sample
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
definitely
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
for
my
tastes
it
is
unique
though
this
is
a
type
i
will
probably
not
try
again
drinkability
i
wouldnt
refuse
to
drink
more
d
its
nothing
special
but
easy
to
pound
back
a
pint
i
dont
really
care
for
this
one
d
if
there
was
a
beer
to
drink
when
one
was
sick
this
would
be
a
good
one
it
is
a
joy
to
drink
and
soothes
the
mouth
and
throat
its
very
filling
though
so
drink
it
slowly
the
drinkability
is
certainly
high
i
could
pound
five
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
drinkability
is
a
marketing
slogan
for
bud
light
thus
not
an
indication
of
a
good
beer
rather
than
chilling
for
23
hours
as
recommended
i
just
stuck
it
in
the
freezer
for
15
minutes
on
this
hot
australian
day
my
first
thought
was
that
the
beer
should
be
colder
but
really
it
is
up
to
individual
choice
whether
you
prefer
the
full
flavour
or
the
refreshment
either
way
an
average
beer
that
i
probably
wouldnt
say
no
to
notes
watery
finishnot
really
creamy
at
all
and
it
just
seemed
to
be
a
bad
idea
from
the
start
not
a
good
beer
highly
drinkable
for
sure
drinkability
i
actually
find
this
quite
drinkable
its
general
inoffensiveness
would
make
it
a
pretty
good
session
beer
in
my
opinion
d
i
can
do
without
the
aroma
and
the
taste
is
really
lacking
i
probably
wont
reach
for
this
one
again
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
has
a
brown
color
with
a
slowly
decending
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
slightly
sweet
taste
is
mild
some
malt
and
hops
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
selection
at
all
the
mouthfeel
however
is
quite
good
it
is
creamy
smooth
and
still
decently
light
besides
having
kind
of
an
off
flavor
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
one
that
i
would
savor
any
flavor
from
but
if
im
putting
one
down
quick
its
not
bad
i
had
tried
a
few
cream
ales
before
this
and
this
isnt
making
the
top
of
my
charts
sorry
wexford
sweet
and
thickslightly
sour
in
the
swallow
light
hop
in
the
background
perhaps
the
best
cream
ale
ive
tastedreminds
me
of
a
british
mild
not
complex
but
tasty
d
pretty
good
i
guess
really
nothing
special
here
if
you
like
cream
stouts
and
dry
stouts
like
i
do
then
dont
expect
much
from
this
beer
i
could
have
drank
a
second
but
normally
i
would
reach
for
something
else
drinking
one
of
these
right
now
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
laid
to
my
lips
but
by
the
same
token
its
much
better
then
some
this
one
has
an
impresive
pour
coming
out
creamy
beige
with
a
growing
transpanrent
bronze
color
burried
beneath
the
suds
as
you
drink
it
you
notice
it
doesnt
have
alot
of
flavor
going
on
a
little
wheat
flavor
but
its
not
unplesant
overall
it
is
pretty
sudsy
smell
is
also
like
grain
fairly
good
to
drink
and
light
enough
to
multiples
of
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
it
seems
a
little
watered
down
it
has
some
malt
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
very
faint
bitterness
from
the
hops
overall
it
is
balanced
well
and
easy
drinking
but
the
initial
excitement
from
the
nitro
was
more
appealing
than
drinking
the
beer
overall
im
quite
happy
with
this
one
id
walked
past
these
cans
for
months
and
finally
decided
to
try
it
i
wasnt
disappointed
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
a
touch
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
creamy
the
finish
is
light
the
nitro
in
the
beer
is
a
little
too
much
it
thined
the
beer
out
too
much
it
is
an
okay
beer
d
i
felt
as
this
beer
got
a
lot
more
drinkable
with
each
subsequent
sip
after
you
are
introduced
to
the
initial
flavor
of
the
can
it
seems
to
disappear
or
i
just
got
used
to
it
so
i
guess
i
just
tasted
more
of
the
beer
as
i
got
accustomed
to
the
canny
taste
not
offensive
and
not
that
rich
so
a
few
of
these
could
be
enjoyed
if
so
inclined
i
however
am
not
nothing
else
about
this
beer
matches
the
bodacious
pour
and
appearance
no
real
aroma
just
a
hint
of
muffled
malt
flavor
is
odd
but
not
undrinkable
kind
of
burnt
tasting
almost
like
charred
cookies
a
hefty
bitterness
worsens
the
overall
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
was
good
and
smooth
if
you
can
separate
it
from
the
flavor
not
something
id
buy
again
but
luckily
i
didnt
pay
for
them
in
the
first
place
if
i
feel
the
need
for
nitro
cans
i
reach
for
old
speckled
hen
d
no
one
that
i
would
try
again
not
my
style
but
might
be
good
as
a
patio
beer
on
a
nice
day
outside
d
drink
by
necessity
only
the
widget
sounds
like
a
jet
engine
when
you
open
the
can
pour
is
the
only
nice
part
of
the
whole
thing
d
a
very
drinkable
if
you
stick
with
it
its
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
ok
this
one
may
have
been
on
the
shelf
a
bit
while
but
still
pleasant
and
id
sit
down
a
with
a
few
with
buddies
and
socialize
as
far
as
the
nitrocan
offering
it
leaves
more
to
be
desired
you
get
much
more
of
a
tinny
taste
up
front
which
really
detracts
from
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
it
also
feels
a
bit
thinner
than
the
nitrotap
version
it
is
still
a
good
beer
for
a
can
and
would
be
in
my
fridge
with
other
nitrocans
like
tetleys
or
boddingtons
but
it
really
cant
be
compared
with
the
nitrotap
version
the
nitrowidget
is
perhaps
one
of
the
best
beer
inventions
next
to
the
widemouth
for
chuggers
or
the
aire
vent
on
a
coors
who
pours
a
coors
or
any
other
american
macro
brew
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
creamy
but
still
light
and
refreshing
not
too
shabby
the
pour
from
a
nitro
can
makes
for
such
a
cool
visual
the
cascading
look
is
so
appealing
bone
white
head
is
totally
creamy
and
stays
around
for
the
entire
experience
faint
alcohol
smell
with
a
slight
sweetness
rounds
out
the
nose
taste
is
mild
with
a
slight
bitterness
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
thin
but
this
beer
is
supremely
drinkable
tastes
good
with
mild
carbonation
an
ideal
session
beer
recommended
it
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
the
nitro
can
helps
this
style
and
it
certainly
is
a
good
example
not
your
dads
genny
cream
ale
though
this
beer
poured
a
light
brown
with
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
creamy
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
biscuity
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
mild
malt
with
some
toffee
that
gives
way
to
some
mild
hops
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
to
start
off
with
thanks
to
the
nitro
widget
but
becomes
thinner
as
the
beer
sits
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
might
be
worth
grabbing
for
fans
of
the
style
flavorful
in
certain
aspects
but
a
but
bland
overall
d
not
memorable
in
anyway
shape
or
form
maybe
the
pour
and
appearance
not
bad
but
not
even
looking
forward
to
the
next
sip
easily
forgettable
drinkability
smooth
as
milk
but
thinner
body
a
good
spring
session
d
im
surprised
by
so
many
bad
reviews
of
this
beer
i
am
not
compelled
to
tell
all
my
friends
they
have
to
go
out
and
try
it
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
it
is
an
everyday
beer
refreshing
and
relaxing
to
drink
somebody
please
come
over
and
drink
these
last
two
cans
overall
i
keep
trying
to
get
into
draught
can
beers
but
i
just
cant
do
it
maybe
its
best
to
save
these
for
the
pub
conclusion
not
bad
but
there
are
way
way
better
english
style
pub
ales
out

i
like
this
beers
drinkability
and
character
not
a
good
session
beer
because
of
its
fullness
but
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
summer
night
after
dinner
sipper
wheres
the
cream
solid
though
a
little
more
rough
to
take
d
good
pub
hangout
brew
if
they
dont
have
anything
better
on
tap
i
personally
prefer
tetleys
if
i
am
going
to
go
along
these
lines
it
looks
like
albino
guiness
sort
of
a
copper
with
highlights
and
a
very
creamy
head
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
sugar
and
its
like
ireland
drifted
over
ran
into
belgium
the
taste
is
like
cocoa
with
a
slight
hop
note
kind
of
lacking
actually
the
mouthfeel
lacks
more
cream
cream
cream
and
flat
its
too
flat
to
be
drinkable
but
the
nice
flavor
is
the
saving
grace
it
poured
into
my
pint
glass
very
creamy
and
cloudy
it
goes
from
a
tan
color
to
almost
a
red
body
which
is
fun
to
watch
it
has
a
very
creamy
beige
head
that
is
smooth
and
milky
to
the
touch
it
has
a
strong
alcohol
aroma
with
some
malt
it
is
a
very
malty
beer
with
virtually
no
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
like
a
shake
overall
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
bitter
but
it
is
a
great
beer
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
seems
kind
of
average
mainly
due
to
its
style
it
simply
didnt
have
enough
character
to
keep
me
interested
if
i
had
to
pick
a
bingebeer
this
would
be
it
for
the
first
15
seconds
after
the
pour
it
is
feels
simply
ethereal
once
the
head
develops
it
remains
more
creamy
than
most
its
those
initial
few
moments
i
wish
i
could
experience
for
the
entirety
of
a
pint
the
flavor
never
crosses
the
idrathernotdrinkthis
barrier
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
draught
cans
ill
definitely
buy
wexfords
draught
again
d
mild
flavor
and
abv
but
the
best
thing
about
this
one
is
the
aroma
if
they
knock
back
12
packs
of
this
in
ireland
instead
of
bmc
then
a
slainte
joe
and
an
erin
go
im
right
there
with
ya
pours
an
amber
reddish
color
body
big
foamy
creamy
head
white
a
sweet
aroma
almost
fruity
similar
to
a
guinness
aroma
but
without
the
coffee
notes
watery
taste
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
grapefruity
creamy
mouthfeel
kinda
bland
bottom
line
nothing
exceptional
except
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
i
havent
encountered
in
many
other
beers
this
one
should
be
easy
to
come
across
too
popped
the
nitro
can
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
lots
of
thick
white
head
had
to
let
the
glass
settle
for
about
3
minutes
there
was
still
about
a
half
inch
of
thick
dense
head
on
top
once
settled
the
color
is
goldcopperorange
smell
is
somewhat
metallic
probably
from
the
can
taste
is
of
subdued
caramel
malts
with
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
quite
nice
drinkability
is
good
its
not
the
kind
of
brew
that
knocks
your
socks
off
with
great
flavor
and
complexity
definitely
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
buy
regularly
i
love
creamy
ales
i
love
nitro
pours
i
love
the
fact
that
the
thing
in
the
beer
can
that
creates
this
is
called
a
widget
i
love
watching
the
beer
swirl
around
and
generate
a
giant
fluffy
white
head
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
latte
than
a
lager
the
wexford
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
thick
offwhite
nitro
head
that
leaves
mild
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
i
sip
the
scent
is
sweet
mild
and
maybe
a
little
malty
the
first
thing
i
notice
isnt
taste
as
much
as
the
overall
feeling
this
beer
has
it
is
slippery
and
smooth
and
creamy
and
feels
like
dessert
it
tastes
very
mild
almost
buttery
i
heart
it
its
certainly
drinkable
but
in
a
somewhat
unremarkable
way
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
feel
a
need
to
do
so
again
anytime
soon
sampled
from
a
glass
out
of
the
draught
can
nice
cascading
that
leads
to
a
bright
amber
color
thick
full
head
with
strong
carbonation
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
faintly
malty
nothing
grand
mouthfeel
is
decent
albeit
i
little
thin
finish
is
crisp
and
smooth
good
flavor
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
malty
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
drinkable
but
very
common
d
ive
only
had
one
other
cream
ale
before
this
one
and
this
one
is
better
its
something
different
to
drink
worth
trying
sometime
for
something
new
pretty
average
all
around
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
but
in
the
end
it
isnt
all
that
memorable
notes
its
head
is
outstanding
creamy
and
smooth
with
an
interesting
flavor
that
i
like
a
little
bit
more
than
other
nitro
canned
beers
that
i
have
had
d
again
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
nothing
especially
noteworthy
but
still
quite
good
this
pours
a
light
brown
color
and
has
a
creamy
tan
head
due
to
the
nitro
can
the
nose
has
some
mild
neutral
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
quite
mild
there
are
sweet
malts
and
somewhat
stale
bitter
hops
the
body
is
light
and
goes
down
smooth
i
think
this
stuff
really
depends
on
the
gimicky
can
this
one
was
fine
and
at
5
close
to
a
session
type
brew
give
one
a
try
d
ok
drinkability
but
really
nothing
special
and
gets
boring
half
way
through
could
live
without
d
skip
it
drinkability
is
good
in
appearance
this
is
a
full
flavored
irish
ale
with
a
solid
head
in
texture
this
is
a
thin
and
watery
brew
with
a
less
than
satisfying
profile
the
flavors
come
up
a
bit
short
in
richness
while
the
aroma
remains
well
crafted
overall
a
decent
cream
ale
d
extremely
drinkable
another
great
social
beer
not
super
interesting
but
goes
down
way
too
easy
overall
a
mediocre
offering
but
very
little
flavor
i
can
scratch
this
1
off
my
mug
club
list
and
promptly
move
on
the
mouthfeel
is
less
the
stellar
its
not
very
creamy
despite
the
name
of
the
brew
but
it
is
nice
and
watery
and
kind
of
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
fine
carbonation
that
allows
you
to
get
it
down
quickly
which
is
a
good
thing
a
great
looking
beer
but
disappointing
in
the
long
run
definitely
fun
to
look
at
and
smooth
to
drink
its
an
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
i
think
in
a
true
pub
atmosphere
this
stuff
would
be
a
great
fun
to
session
and
slosh
around
its
irish
cream
ale
but
the
brewery
is
in
england
and
is
distributed
by
a
company
in
sc
this
is
one
lost
and
confused
beer
pours
an
orangeyamber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
guinness
like
offwhite
head
the
head
leaves
a
thick
coat
all
the
way
around
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
and
the
head
persists
until
the
last
sip
aroma
has
a
subtle
hop
character
and
a
little
bitterness
but
also
a
sweet
malty
aroma
taste
is
alright
there
is
a
malty
burst
of
caramel
and
maybe
some
other
flavors
i
cant
pinpoint
not
a
very
complex
brew
though
also
a
slight
metalic
feel
most
likely
from
the
can
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
it
is
still
and
very
creamy
but
very
appropriate
for
the
style
drinkability
is
high
due
to
low
alcohol
and
subtle
flavor
pours
the
classic
layered
look
from
the
nitro
faintly
cloudy
medium
amber
color
with
plentiful
dense
head
aromas
are
quite
mild
with
sweet
corn
husky
notes
dominating
a
note
reminiscent
or
reislings
is
also
there
slightly
winelike
an
exceptionally
clean
ale
flavors
are
very
smooth
really
no
hop
bitterness
a
faint
grassy
floral
feel
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
drinkable
for
basically
a
forgettable
ale
pours
great
an
excellent
cascading
form
that
leaves
great
head
and
lacing
and
has
a
nice
light
amber
color
has
an
odd
scent
though
a
very
well
mixed
malthop
scent
but
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
rotten
aroma
good
taste
a
nice
english
ale
but
it
has
a
bit
of
beef
jerkey
flavor
goes
down
nice
it
would
never
be
my
first
choice
but
i
would
not
turn
one
down
either
poured

fairly
appealing
straw

and

was
faint
and
mundane
some
light
malts
and
a
touch

taste
was
really
quite
bland
some
light
matlyness
with
only
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
good
very
creamy
due
to
the
nitro
but
seemed
flat
and
lifeless
drinkability
wasnt
all
that
good
this
was
ok
but
only
because
of
the
nitro
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
wouldnt
recommend
it
in
summary
this
ale
was
good
and
easilly
drinkable
its
higher
abc
will
have
a
greater
effect
than
some
other
nitro
cans
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
can
become
thin
after
a
bit
overall
decent
nothing
special
though
kilkenneys
remains
my
favorite
but
we
still
cant
get
that
in
the
states

thanks
kyoko
d
would
be
a
good
session
bitter
or
cream
ale
type
beer
i
could
see
buying
this
again
for
the
night
it
is
relatively
cheap
d
a
very
light
beer
could
be
drunk
as
a
thirst
quencher
nothing
to
write
home
about
pouring
a
nitro
can
is
always
an
experience
youll
come
out
with
a
very
creamy
thick
frothy
head
and
beneath
it
will
be
an
amber
beer
the
joy
is
in
watching
the
creamy
carbonation
make
its
way
up
to
the
top
after
that
the
show
is
over
and
what
youll
get
is
a
very
average
beer
that
really
laces
it
up
the
smell
is
malt
grain
maybe
some
buttery
notes
the
consistency
of
the
beer
is
quite
watery
and
the
creaminess
dissipates
quickly
there
isnt
much
cream
after
the
beer
settles
the
taste
is
part
tartish
hop
part
sour
malt
bordering
on
curdled
lactose
and
part
nutty
dryness
i
wont
be
trying
this
beer
again
anytime
soon
perhaps
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
pub
style
cask
conditioned
ales
and
maybe
this
one
is
trying
to
emulate
that
its
not
for
me
drinkability
much
to
my
dismay
this
beer
followed
the
exact
same
course
as
the
can
of
tetleys
i
had
recently
sure
it
looked
great
and
smelled
fine
but
in
both
cases
its
all
downhill
from
there
really
good
cream
ale
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
just
good
smooth
taste
really
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
average
and
uneventful
but
a
good
sessionable
beer
if
you
need
to
keep
up
with
some
other
people
for
whatever
reason
could
drink
a
bunch
but
i
would
eventually
get
sick
of
it
guiness
gets
a
slighly
higher
score
here
due
to
the
stronger
flavor
though
the
texture
is
the
same
or
better
not
bad
not
bad
overall
another
great
offering
from
greene
king
smooth
and
enjoyable
recommended
d
i
ending
up
dumping
the
last
3
or
4
ozs
of
this
brew
as
i
grew
tired
of
the
taste
a
very
flavorful
cream
stout
but
i
find
it
odd
that
it
is
an
irish
cream
stout
and
yet
its
brewed
in
england
it
has
an
excellent
pour
with
an
impressive
head
very
creamy
texture
and
very
golden
color
wonderfully
flavored
with
a
distinctive
sweet
note
to
it
derinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
whole
lot
there
drinks
very
easily
but
not
very
remarkable
not
recommended
boring
and
lacking
anything
that
would
really
keep
me
coming
back
overall
this
would
be
great
for
a
long
night
i
enjoyed
this
one
immenselyit
looked
greatpoured
very
welland
was
easy
drinking
the
only
problem
i
had
with
it
was
the
tastewhich
imho
was
bland
or
maybe
flat
would
be
a
better
word
i
would
love
to
try
it
againbut
at
11
dollars
for
a
4
pack
where
i
got
iti
am
forced
to
buy
it
sparingly
not
very
good
on
the
drinkability
scale
started
out
ok
and
seemed
to
get
worse
this
acutally
isnt
that
bad
for
a
cream
ale
the
nitro
seems
to
help
this
style
with
the
exception
of
the
metallic
aftertaste
its
not
bad
at
all
and
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
beer
here
too
dry
and
generally
boring
dont
understand
why
this
doesnt
have
a
higher
rating
on
the
beerometer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
huge
creamy
light
tan
head
mellow
aroma
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
taste
is
big
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
not
much
hoppiness
but
enough
to
balance
it
nicely
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
a
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
to
just
sip
on
and
enjoy
enjoyed
on
st
patttys
day
2006
in
honor
of
the
saint
and
the
snake
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
from
the
nitro
which
is
good
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
flat
as
hell
a
hint
of
carbonation
would
stimulate
the
palate
a
bit
and
set
this
beer
off
but
as
it
is
the
flatness
moreso
highlights
what
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
im
sure
it
will
work
well
in
a
half
half
with
something
more
bold
like
a
bigfoot
perhaps
but
on
its
own
i
am
not
a
big
fan
marginally
better
than
boddingtons
allinall
not
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
just
wish
it
was
creamier
like
a
petes
wanderlust
or
maybe
like
a
smooth
taste
of
irish
cream
ale
drinkers
might
like
this
but
then
again
i
guess
thats
what
you
can
expect
when
the
uk
brews
an
irish
traditional
ale
ouch
i
got
this
beer
on
tap
but
it
almost
seemed
more
like
a
cask
ale
it
was
fairly
flat
and
a
bit
warmer
than
normal
that
being
said
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
reddish
hues
in
it
the
aroma
has
strong
biscuity
smells
as
well
as
a
good
malty
background
there
are
no
detectable
hops
in
either
the
aroma
or
the
taste
what
the
taste
does
have
is
more
of
the
what
the
aroma
offers
sweet
malty
flavors
this
beer
is
actually
surprisingly
sweet
as
i
said
before
the
beer
had
very
light
body
and
a
flat
taste
but
im
not
sure
if
that
was
a
result
of
how
it
was
served
or
not
i
would
rate
the
drinkability
as
average
mostly
due
to
not
knowing
the
mouthfeel
better
this
beer
came
to
me
with
a
nice
nitrofed
stayput
head
it
was
a
tarnished
brassy
color
the
smell
was
a
beautiful
mix
of
sweet
musty
gran
herbal
hop
a
barely
dectable
yeastiness
the
taste
is
a
swirl
of
sturdy
honey
herbal
hop
and
malt
swetness
there
were
definatly
some
other
subtleties
there
but
i
was
a
little
to
destracted
to
pick
them
out
simple
but
damn
delicious
mouthfeel
was
of
course
dreamy
and
creamy
was
delicious
with
irish
root
soup
pretty
poundable
but
i
believe
id
want
to
move
on
after
a
couple
just
doesnt
hold
your
attention
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
session
this
style
any
day
and
this
one
is
particularly
tasty
d
interesting
for
a
few
but
not
my
choice
for
regular
or
longnight
drinking
cream
ale
is
right
the
head
looks
like
dessert
and
its
not
going
away
anytime
soon
not
much
to
smell
a
bit
like
cream
soda
rich
and
deep
with
a
bitter
dry
breakfast
tea
finish
if
you
are
already
a
fan
of
boddingtons
then
this
ale
is
right
in
that
ballpark
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
every
day
fore
feels
creamy
but
the
flavor
is
watery
light
fruitsapple
mostly
though
there
is
some
white
grapewith
a
bit
of
cereal
grains
finish
is
stale
and
unpleasant
not
anything
id
choose
to
drink
again
this
ale
pours
a
nice
bronze
amber
with
nice
mochacolored
dense
creamy
head
it
has
a
light
hoppy
aroma
and
it
goes
down
smooth
with
an
obvious
creamy
quality
and
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sharp
flavors
i
didnt
note
much
or
any
bitterness
though
that
may
just
be
my
palate
definitely
one
to
share
and
enjoy
with
friends
clean
slightly
sweet
aroma
copper
in
color
with
a
consistent
white
head
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
tart
with
a
balanced
bitterness
and
a
noble
hop
flavor
creamy
nitrous
infused
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
anytime
a
great
session
brew
id
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
around
3
00
a
can
at
my
local
i
love
it
pours
a
clear
clean
straw
with
a
fluffy
nitro
induced
head
aroma
is
faint
some
grassy
hops
are
present
taste
is
good
its
clean
slight
tart
taste
in
as
well
and
grassy
hops
again
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
on
the
thin
side
its
a
passable
session
beer
but
not
world
class
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
it
is
creamy
smooth
has
a
very
caramel
and
dark
fruit
taste
to
it
theres
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
backend
of
the
beer
unfortunately
the
flavor
isnt
all
too
complex
and
not
all
that
exciting
its
certainly
a
solid
beer
and
by
no
means
offensive
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
bit
thin
and
it
finishes
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
worth
a
try
its
just
not
overly
interesting
when
i
first
started
drinking
good
beer
this
is
one
of
the
first
i
bought
i
didnt
like
it
then
i
must
admit
it
doesnt
thrill
me
now
either
i
used
to
really
like
nitro
can
beers
while
my
opinion
has
changed
i
still
thin
they
pour
a
pretty
looking
glass
of
beer
this
is
no
exception
head
is
like
whipped
cream
that
stands
an
inch
tall
body
is
hazy
honey
and
caramel
nose
is
the
achilles
heel
at
first
i
can
smell
only
caramel
but
eventually
i
also
get
honey
sweetness
and
a
wisp
of
hops
i
wish
there
was
more
going
on
taste
wise
but
as
of
now
i
only
get
some
caramel
hops
and
a
bit
of
sugar
theres
a
weird
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
dislike
quite
a
bit
did
i
say
the
nose
was
the
achilles
heel
make
that
the
taste
and
mouth
too
mouth
is
sometimes
thick
and
sometimes
thin
and
watery
i
dont
have
plans
to
try
this
again
any
time
soon
good
beer
but
i
like
old
speckled
hen
a
little
more
but
still
very
good
beer
d
outstanding
easy
to
drink
flavor
is
simple
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
sessionable
and
a
natural
for
food
tastes
like
most
other
englishesque
ales
though
i
might
have
it
again
but
damned
if
im
buying
it
i
have
to
admit
im
a
sucker
for
nitro
cans
im
also
a
sucker
for
a
sexy
looking
beer
and
thus
im
a
fan
of
wexford
if
you
see
the
can
and
expect
a
guiness
style
beer
this
isnt
it
this
is
not
a
irish
stout
its
a
irish
cream
ale
and
its
damn
good
this
beer
is
smooth
very
drinkable
and
has
a
mild
yet
full
flavored
taste
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
its
a
very
high
quality
brew
i
just
love
nitrocan
beers
every
beer
should
be
in
a
nitrocan
beautiful
cascading
pour
with
a
thick
creamy
head
looks
like
a
golden
guinness
maybe
its
the
nitro
cartridge
but
it
even
smells
a
bit
like
guinness
as
well
however
the
taste
is
not
guinness
this
may
have
been
in
my
fridge
a
little
long
a
bit
of
a
mettle
taste
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
more
vibrant
here
as
well
too
much
so
for
the
5
0
abv
i
dont
i
think
i
like
this
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
watery
i
was
somewhat
dissapointed
by
this
brew
i
had
it
at
a
pub
ontap
the
other
day
and
at
first
glance
it
looked
apealing
i
could
barely
finish
the
pint
there
was
just
something
about
it
that
was
wrong
it
did
have
a
nice
malt
taste
but
other
than
that
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
and
the
finish
was
bitter
in
a
bad
way
youd
do
yourself
a
favor
by
having
a
better
cream
ale
drinkabilityslides
down
real
nice
drinkability
not
very
good
tasting
so
its
not
sessionable
never
really
cared
for
the
pressurized
widget
cans
because
it
leaves
a
certain
undesirable
taste
on
my
taste
buds
but
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
all
the
way
d
it
was
good
but
a
little
unusual
for
my
taste
i
may
try
one
again
sometime
just
to
see
what
i
think
of
it
at
a
later
time

is

well
if
you
like
it
that
way
a
little
light
on
the
hops
even
for
an
irish
cream
ale
but
aside
from
the
slick
finish
it
is
mild
and
drinkable
well
those
nitro
can
beers
are
really
impressive
in
appeareance
but
they
lose
in
their
lack
of
complexity
and
mildness
this
one
was
supposed
to
be
a
ultracreamy
beer
but
it
doesnt
work
the
nitrogen
gives
a
good
start
but
after
that
the
beer
shows
itself

i
absolutely
love
the
appearance
of
the
pour
produced
from
nitro
cans
and
this
beer
proves
no
different
however
it
is
just
lacking
on
taste
and
body
decent
but
nothing
there
that
makes
me
want
to
try
again

taste

the
same
a
blend

that
is

a

bland
the
mouthfeel
is
very
flat
with
little
carbination
in
the
beer
aside
from
the
nitro
head
while
i
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
outstanding
it
still
makes
a
good
session
beer
good
beer
but
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
but
osh
and
got
the
extra
beer
and
no
nitro
tab
d
high
you
could
pound
this
beer
very
easy
in
the
future
this
is
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
mroe
straight
outta
the
can
i
tasted
this
beer
right
out
of
the
fridge
after
over
8hrs
in
and
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
really
came
out
and
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
so
than
at
the
cooler
temp
can
says
serve
well
chilled
next
time
id
serve
slightly
chilled
drinkablilty
i
could
drink
many
of
these
very
good
beer
i
was
surprised
it
didnt
have
a
higher
average
rating
light
carbonation
on
this
can
its
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
very
easily
complimented
since
this
beer
has
almost
no
flavor
or
aroma
i
think
it
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
also
with
a
low
alcohol
content
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
not
much
to
this
beer
better
than
bud
though
poured
from
a
nitro
can
a
deep
golden
color
developes
after
the
nitrogen
settles
a
nice
thick
head
is
there
at
the
end
a
lite
citrusy
scent
is
there
at
first
followed
by
a
sweet
creamy
aroma
at
the
end
the
taste
is
what
one
would
expect
creamy
sweet
taste
a
touch
fruitiness
followed
by
a
hint
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
in
the
mouth
it
feels
slightly
rich
but
a
little
more
to
a
watery
feel
and
finishes
dry
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
taste
with
an
excellent
finish
makes
this
a
solid
beer
the
beer
pours
a
very
deep
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
thick
and
creamy
head
over
top
that
gives
no
sign
of
breaking
up
the
requisite
cascade
from
the
nitrogen
settles
quickly
and
leaves
a
brilliantly
clear
beer
i
really
like
the
fortitude
of
the
head
on
this
beer
its
almost
a
colloid
nose
is
light
caramel
and
cream
with
almost
a
hint
of
banana
very
mild
but
very
good
flavor
is
more
generically
fruity
than
the
nose
with
a
very
healthy
creamy
character
finishing
with
just
a
kiss
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
lingers
just
long
enough
to
let
me
know
its
there
the
feel
is
on
the
thicker
end
of
moderate
with
a
very
light
carbonation
as
expected
from
a
nitro
can
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
i
could
see
drinking
this
one
to
mix
things
up
from
time
to
time
as
the
abv
really
makes
it
something
to
session
but
there
is
enough
flavor
there
to
make
it
more
approachable
to
me
overall
if
i
wanted
something
pleasant
to
have
without
wanting
to
think
about
it
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
this
beer
was
a
lighter
colored
beer
there
was
a
creamy
head
as
is
typical
with
nitro
beers
there
was
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
smell
the
taste
had
subtle
notes
of
bourbon
in
it
i
asked
wcudwight
his
opinion
and
he
seconded
that
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
i
could
drink
these
again
but
i
would
not
make
a
habit
of
it
this
brew
has
a
bit
of
sentimental
value
for
me
it
reminds
me
of
sophomore
year
of
college
but
then
again
i
also
feel
like
i
shouldnt
appreciate
an
english
brew
that
claims
to
be
irish
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
it
again
if
available
although
it
might
not
be
my
first
choice
ah
say
what
you
will
about
nitro
it
makes
for
a
beautiful
pour
truly
a
sight
to
behold
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
creamy
head
from
a
one
pint
nitro
can
smell
is
on
the
malty
side
the
mouthfeel
is
luxurious
as
it
usually
is
with
nitro
taste
is
pretty
mild
malt
up
front
fading
to
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
not
much
of
one
though
very
sessionable
not
an
outstanding
beer
by
any
means
but
quite
drinkable
and
most
definitely
worth
a
try
unless
you
are
a
nitro
hater
of
course
i
think
nitro
beers
have
their
place
much
like
malt
liquor
and
belgian
ales
have
a
place
as
different
as
they
are
it
just
may
not
be
the
place
you
are
at
thin
creamy
taste
and
feel
smooth
malt
taste
that
pleases
my
mouth
with
every
sip
easy
going
down
with
an
amazingly
pleasant
palate
i
will
drink
this
almost
anytime
its
available
the
cascade
that
forms
when
this
brew
is
poured
is
excellent
it
posesses
a
thick
heavy
creamfilled
head
and
awesome
amberhue
the
taste
caught
me
a
little
offguard
though
as
it
was
certainly
more
english
in
taste
than
irish
another
look
at
the
can
revealed
that
this
greene
king
product
does
hail
from
england
although
the
name
suggests
someplace
greener
all
in
all
a
good
brew
left
me
a
little
heavy
at
the
end
though
its
a
good
thing
this
is
only
a
4pack
d
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
again
though
the
color
is
a
caramel
copper
head
is
typical
of
a
nitro
can
mediumsized
creamy
and
milky
white
the
retention
is
of
course
excellent
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
english
malt
a
bit
fruity
with
a
little
of
that
gassy
nitro
aroma
wexfords
taste
is
more
of
the
same
english
malt
sweet
and
mildly
fruity
a
note
of
honey
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
this
is
better
than
the
few
creams
ive
tried
before
and
is
certainly
easydrinking
but
then
again
this
isnt
that
great
and
not
worth
buying
again

with
a
frosty
white
head
that
holds
together
beautifully
in
a
thick
lace
lasting
until
the
last
gulp
the
soft
silky
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
the
first
thing
you
notice
followed
elegantly
by
a
subtle
vanilla
ice
creamirish
cream
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
finishing
with
an
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
a
shot
of
baileys
a
truly
unique
and
delicious
cream
ale
the
creamywatery
texture
and
grapefruit
metallicastringent
finish
would
limit
my
session
with
this
beer
i
was
really
excited
about
this
brew
damn
oh
well
i
guess
my
expectations
were
too
high
poured
out
to
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
constant
18
inch
creamy
head
nice
so
far
low
overall
carbonation
not
much
aroma
if
any
some
buttery
and
creamy
odors
but
not
much
taste
was
a
bit
too
rigid
for
what
i
would
call
a
good
cream
ale
flavors
of
caramel
nuts
and
some
malt
little
hops
very
smooth
mouthfeel
but
that
is
expected
when
discussing
this
style
i
guess
this
is
an
average
brew
at
best
but
some
thicker
mouthfeel
and
flavor
would
really
improve
this
brew
worth
a
try
a
little
light
on
taste
mellow
and
velvety
in
the
mouth
not
exciting
but
a
very
decent
drink
in
any
case
serve
this
one
cold
opinion
well
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
just
have
an
opinion
on
as
far
as
delivery
cleanlines
and
balance
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
decent
cream
ale
this
is
a
british
version
so
you
cant
open
this
beer
expecting
to
drink
a
genessee
the
british
malts
add
a
distinctive
caramelbutter
presence
that
is
typical
of
british
styles
it
is
not
my
personal
favorite
beer
but
i
dont
drink
too
many
of
the
british
styles
of
beer
its
worth
a
try
just
to
see
if
it
agrees
with
your
palate
goes
down
silky
smooth
but
almost
too
flat
and
thin
a
drinkable
brew
but
not
the
best
out
there
reddishamber
hue
pours
as
creamy
and
smooth
as
jessica
simpons
thighs
lightly
toasted
malt
aromas
with
delicate
hop
accents
follows
through
on
a
mediumbodied
palate
with
soft
malty
flavors
to
the
fore
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitters
on
the
finish
highly
drinkable
impression
flavors
are
fair
for
style
mouthfeel
is
worth
shelling
out
the
bucks
for
a
nitro
beer
not
a
bold
beer
so
enjoy
it
early
in
your
session
drinkability
8
99
for
a
4pack
of
cans
youre
kidding
me
right
not
worth
it
for
that
price
glad
i
got
to
sample
a
can
for
free
very
similar
to
boddingtons
but
a
touch
better
in
my
opinion
edit
the
more
i
drain
my
glass
the
more
i
can
taste
a
faint
touch
of
honey
its
there
in
the
smell
as
well
however
faint
overall
a
nice
brew
this
would
probably
be
great
if
it
were
just
in
a
normal
can
as
it
stands
it
is
merely
pretty
good
this
is
e
beer
i
drink
quite
a
bit
of
at
my
local
bar
it
pours
a
clear
amber
after
the
nitro
action
calms
down
with
a
nice
creamy
head
low
in
carbonation
it
needs
to
be
cold
its
incredibly
drinkable
very
smooth
and
creamy
it
lacks
much
complexity
slight
fruits
in
the
nose
for
me
but
nothing
amazing
i
enjoy
this
beer
when
im
just
sitting
at
the
bar
shooting
the
breeze
a
quality
standby
nitro
can
widget
and
all
a
hard
pour
elicits
the
expected
creamy
head
and
descending
bubbles
this
one
pours
hazy
light
amber
with
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
head
is
creamy
off
white
and
leaves
oodles
of
frothy
lacing
nose
is
nutty
and
malty
this
is
a
light
bodied
ale
watery
in
the
center
lightly
malty

of
maple

on
the

goes
down

and

with

hops
and
caramelized

grace
the
nose
up

a
thin
yet
satisfied
palate

the
nitro
takes
full
affect
via
the
decent
malt
flavorings
fresh
fruit
and
some
nutty
offerings
in
the
body
pretty
well
balanced
creamy
and
slick
hops
make
this
one
well
rounded
all
in
all
a
decent
cream
ale
feels
smooth
going
down
and
defitnatly
something
i
could
drink
many
of
in
a
row
in
fact
i
have
been
mouthfeel
creamy

feel
a
little
powdery
in
texture
i
admit
i
dislike
the
sensation
pint
nitrowidget
can
poured
a
butterscotch
gold
with
one
of
the
nicest
reverse
cascades
ive
seen
from
one
of
these
cans
aroma
was
sugary
flavors
were
all
of
a
sweet
variety
without
the
beer
being
overly
sweet
itself
caramel
brown
or
raw
cane
sugar
toasted
oatmeal
watery
in
the
moutfeel
but
this
is
always
the
case
with
a
nitro
can
pour
overall
the
beer
seemed
too
processed
pours
a
ripe
coppergold
with
thin
sticky
head
from
nitro
aroma
of
oaky
chardonnay
which
is
carried
over
into
the
flavor
to
marry
with
sweet
malts
and
an
ale
fruitiness
there
is
a
slight
sharpness
and
sourness
to
the
hops
which
is
typical
of
many
european
brews
the
beer
is
pleasantly
buttery
and
relatively
fullflavored
for
a
nitrogen
can
but
doesnt
do
much
to
excite
the
palate
or
other
senses
for
that
matter
perhaps
it
can
be
best
appreciated
as
an
exercise
in
restraint
prolonged
exposure
to
this
beer
will
add
to
its
appeal
i
e
the
more
you
drink
the
better
it
tastes
it
may
serve
well
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
meal
of
hearty
but
bland
lamb
stew
or
possibly
a
very
mild
cheese
or
perhaps
it
may
be
best
suited
to
soothe
the
stomach
after
a
round
of
jameson
another
decent
nitro
offering
that
again
raises
the
question
of
when
and
where
can
i
find
my
beloved
mansfield
ale
nitro
can
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
just
a
little
bit
of
head
there
is
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
a
little
light
some
caramel
aromas
the
tsate
is
malty
as
well
but
has
a
bit
of
fruitiness
to
it
theres
a
little
bit
of
hops
but
nothing
really
exciting
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
for
a
nitro
beer
and
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
too
just
needs
a
little
bit
more
in
the
taste
department
i
dont
like
widgets
but
this
brew
widget
and
all
was
better
than
most
i
probably
served
it
warmer
than
i
should
have
since
there
was
an
explosive
discharge
on
popping
the
can
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
the
usual
nitrogencorrupted
thick
foam
its
got
a
mild
subdued
aroma
thats
composed
of
a
bit
of
malt
and
fleeting
hop
smells
the
taste
is
creamy
buttery
sweet
and
full
of
caramel
flavors
nicely
balanced
with
a
hop
finish
its
surprisingly
good
given
the
disappointing
aroma
its
smooth
and
seems
a
little
thicker
than
other
nitrobrews
i
enjoyed
this
one
in
spite
of
myself
this
is
a
comfort
beer
it
is
not
challenging
enough
to
incite
conflict
but
it
is
personable
enough
to
welcome
companionship
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
tremendously
and
found
it
to
be
smooth
relaxing
and
highly
drinkable
oelergud
nitro
pint
light
copper
body
with
a
cream
colored
nitro
head
light
caramel
in
the
nose
a
tiny
bit
bready
some
butter
and
a
hint
of
tinny
hops
caramel
is
much
more
subdued
on
the
palate
than
it
is
in
the
nose
bread
is
more
prominent
here
as
are
the
hops
which
provide
surprising
flavor
and
bitterness
hops
are
a
little
bit
metallic
but
bitterness
is
firm
fruity
malt
yeast
aftertaste
isnt
really
scrubbed
away
because
the
carbonation
is
so
low
damn
nitro
all
in
all
a
nice
change
of
pace
kind
of
beer
this
had
a
great
cascading
action
yielding
a
big
white
head
once
the
beer
settled
down
it
was
a
light
amber
color
with
a
sweet
maltiness
on
the
nose
it
had
a
light
mouthfeel
very
creamy
on
the
tongue
with
a
mild
honey
taste
at
the
finish
it
also
left
behind
some
great
clinging
belgian
lace
for
some
reason
i
expected
good
things
from
wexford
irish
cream
ale
but
it
had
other
ideas
the
simple
unvarnished
truth
is
that
it
just
isnt
very
good
beer
poured
with
a
whipped
creamlike
head
with
a
pretty
standard
nitro
cascade
smells
only
lightly
of
malt
and
hops
but
this
beer
is
still
pretty
good
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
but
the
creamy
body
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
tastes
a
lot
like
a
nitro
hens
tooth
not
very
flavorful
but
still
good
pale
gold
body
with
a
very
nice
creamy
head
malty
aroma
with
little
hoppiness
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
strong
artificial
licorice
flavor
which
i
did
not
really
care
for
great
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
really
ruins
this
brew
i
got
sick
of
the
taste
pretty
quickly
probably
wont
drink
this
one
again
very
nice
light
pale
color
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
about
0
5
in
thick
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
fruitiness
the
taste
is
lightly
malty
has
a
nice
light
sweetness
to
it
along
with
a
nice
subtle
hop
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
for
sipping
while
sitting
in
the
sun
not
bad
by
any
means
but
being
a
little
bit
more
of
everything
would
have
made
it
much
better
light
copper
with
a
creamy
head
no
lacing
was
evident
smell
was
nondistinct
flavor
was
lightly
malty
with
no
distinct
qualities
on
the
start
or
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
and
as
with
the
taste
nondistinct
easy
enough
to
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
had
it
superwarm
out
of
a
can
crappy
creamy
shaving
foam
head
im
sick
of
these
nitro
beer
appearances
smooth
and
creamy
catpissy
mouthfeel
really
bland
and
sweet
aswell
typical
nitro
crap
bland
but
perhaps
it
didnt
help
that
it
was
a
little
warm
still
its
obviously
crap
clear
honeycoppery
hue
with
indefinite
bronze
influences
too
nitrogen
induced
creamy
offwhite
head
yes
the
cascading
affect
is
pleasant
to
look
at
but
the
widget
is
such
an
annoying
gimmick
anyway
the
head
settled
at
two
fingers
in
height
very
sturdy
the
retention
was
fantastic
the
subsequent
lacing
looked
liked
tattered
wallpaper
the
nose
is
uneventful
largely
clean
maybe
the
massive
head
is
filtering
the
aromas
or
not
there
is
some
sweetness
some
buttery
hints
and
a
faint
mineralmetal
twang
at
the
back
the
potency
is
very
poor
and
there
fails
to
be
a
request
to
quaff
the
palate
is
bearable
it
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
little
maltiness
in
the
middle
and
buttery
after
that
in
the
finish
an
indistinguishable
trace
of
hops
might
have
blipped
the
radar
maybe
not
the
aftertaste
is
mineraly
and
a
tad
muddled
i
am
not
that
well
versed
in
cream
ales
at
this
point
i
have
had
two
genesee
cream
ale
and
little
kings
cream
ale
thats
it
thats
the
list
wexford
is
better
but
the
competition
is
not
much
as
a
whole
the
palate
is
simplistic
that
is
polite
for
boring
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
nicely
creamy
but
it
does
fall
apart
at
the
end
a
touch
watery
too
typical
it
would
seem
for
a
nitrocan
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
it
is
not
awful
or
anything
it
is
just
pointless
i
picked
up
a
nitrocan
on
a
whim
in
iowa
city
it
was
a
dollar
at
a
grocery
store
not
worth
buying
if
you
ask
me
the
color
was
dark
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
was
on
the
mild
side
the
taste
was
mellow
and
a
little
citrusy
the
irish
malt
was
not
too
prominent
overall
it
was
a
smooth
beer
with
not
much
carbonation
and
it
was
not
very
bitter
or
sweet
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
i
didnt
find
much
to
recommend
it
except
it
probably
wouldnt
be
too
bad
with
a
heavy
meal
drinkability
goes
down
surprisingly
easy
not
something
id
necessarily
buy
a
sixer
of
but
a
pretty
nice
offering
nonetheless
the
beer
pours
a
perfect
gold
color
with
an
awesome
head
the
picture
perfect
beer
the
aroma
is
good
it
is
creamy
with
a
malty
scent
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
pale
and
creamy
with
a
real
irish
ale
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
perfect
carbonation
this
drinks
great
it
has
great
flavor
and
awesome
mouthfeel
finally
an
english
ale
i
like
btw
these
nitro
cans
tend
to
spew
when
opened
1
pint
nitro
can
with
widget
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
big
frothy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
several
minutes
foamy
lacing
all
over
the
pint
glass
floral
hops
jump
out
from
the
nosea
major
surprise
before
some
caramel
melds
in
i
dont
really
care
for
the
mouthfeel
its
really
smooth
but
seems
watered
down
and
all
the
carbonation
must
have
gone
to
the
head
taste
is
medium
malty
well
hopped
and
smooth
and
creamy
not
much
else
it
has
a
malty
finish
that
is
mostly
smooth
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
light
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
but
not
complex
enough
to
want
to
this
is
pure
nectar
to
my
tastebuds
epitome
of
a
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
until
i
fell
asleep
in
a
puddle
of
my
own
drool
with
a
hand
clasped
around
the
pint
that
finally
did
me
in
if
only
i
could
get
kilkenny
in
the
us
i
could
hold
my
own
personal
tasteoff
zum
wohl
the
taste
however
not
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
kinda
malty
not
too
hoppy
exceedingly
creamy
however
a
decent
ale
i
suppose
better
on
the
visuals
than
the
actual
taste
might
make
a
decent
brew
at
a
holiday
party
an
unappealing
milky
brown
color
quickly
gives
way
to
a
brilliant
copper
hue
that
is
topped
off
with
a
fingers
worth
of
light
beige
foam
that
endures
long
but
laces
little
smell
is
terribly
weak
with
mere
hints
of
crisp
grains
and
creamy
sweetness
this
is
a
cream
ale
to
be
sure
with
a
taste
and
texture
that
invokes
dairy
as
much
as
it
invokes
beer
grains
and
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
combine
for
a
taste
that
is
unsophisticated
but
probably
for
the
best
is
largely
overshadowed
by
the
striking
creaminess
its
smoothness
is
its
greatest
virtue
but
i
would
happily
trade
it
for
some
character
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
looks
slightly
watered
down
but
has
a
good
head
the
aroma
is
very
weak
but
a
little
metallic
aroma
is
present
and
it
is
a
little
bready
this
was
surprisingly
smooth
to
drink
but
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
character
it
is
a
little
bready
just
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
sweetness
comes
through
after
a
little
while
slight
metallic
taste
nothing
too
wonderful
here
but
it
is
pretty
smooth
most
didnt
seem
to
be
very
impressed
with
this
beer
but
i
really
thought
it
was
quite
good
just
as
the
name
says
it
is
indeed
quite
creamy
the
smell
seemed
light
but
pleasant
and
the
taste
although
indeed
creamy
was
mild
and
not
at
all
strong
in
fact
unlike
most
widget
can
beers
from
the
uk
this
one
seemed
almost
thirst
quenching
a
really
easy
beer
drink
wexford
is
nice
and
smooth
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
slim
nitro
head
another
brew
that
would
be
nothing
without
the
nitro
smooth
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
for
a
nitro
brew
this
mouthfeel
is
subpar
sweet
malts
and
weak
hops
dont
help
the
brew
too
much
i
will
not
recomend
this
beer
there
are
many
better
brews
out
there
although
anytime
you
pickup
64oz
of
beer
for
3
in
boston
you
feel
good
about
it

the
clover
honeycolored
beer
cascades
down
the
side
of

the
head
sticks
around
to
the
end
and
leaves

all
the
way
down
the

the
smell
is
bready
with
barely
detectable
hops
not
a
lot
is
happening
in
the
taste
either
a
bit
of
biscuit
is
noticeable
and
it
has
a
sweetness
that
becomes
more
pronounced
after
a
few
drinks
all
in
all
the
taste
is
pretty
uninspired
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
nice
and
it
does
go
down
well
its
not
a
terrible
choice
for
a
warm
day
but
better
choices
abound

impression
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
virtually
static
and
doesnt
change
appreciably
as
the
beer
breathes
lean
passably
dextrinous
in
mouthfeel
but
stagnant
and
lacking
any
vibrancy
that
would
otherwise
be
present
without
the
nitrogenation
finishes
with
a
brief
metallic
surge
followed
by
fading
cidery
sweetness
this
beer
tastes
flat
and
lifeless
yet
manages
to
sit
heavily
on
the
palate
even
boddingtons
has
more
overall
character
buying
a
four
pack
was
quite
a
mistake
yawn
inducing
at
best
given
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
good
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
after
the
third
swallow
a
beer
that
really
grew
on
me
this
is
a
very
creamy
ale
for
surepours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
great
creamysticky
headafter
that
it
loses
some
luster
slight
mineral
like
malty
aroma
but
not
much
there
taste
has
some
slight
malty
fruitiness
but
again
not
to
muchan
easy
drinker
and
nice
looking
but
nothing
in
betwwen
this
brew
poured
a
large
creamy
head
of
very
fine
white
bubbles
which
later
settled
to
a
small
head
and
a
transparent
amber
body
as
i
drank
from
my
mug
it
left
behind
a
most
excellent
clinging
vine
lacing
that
never
sagged
it
has
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
with
a
very
smooth
initial
taste
that
smoothly
finishes
it
has
a
very
warm
somewhat
chewy
flavor
of
malts
and
bread
this
beer
poured
a
large
invigorating
long
lasting
white
creamy
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
there
was
no
carbonation
observed
with
this
beer
the
nose
was
fruity
the
hue
of
this
beer
is
golden
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
thin
it
has
excellent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
it
has
a
mild
aftertaste
to
it
and
a
slight
bitterness
this
was
one
creamy
beer
hence
the
name
but
that
seemed
to
be
all
it
had
going
for
it
light
malt
taste
and
no
hops
detected
after
the
gorgeous
head
the
body
was
quite
thin
in
appearance
and
taste
it
finishes
with
a
candy
like
sweetness
this
might
be
a
good
after
dinner
beer
if
you
want
something
sweet
but
not
too
aggressive
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
is
somewhat
loose
and
watery
but
surprisingly
has
a
nice
retention
aroma
is
quite
faint
but
there
are
notes
of
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
buttermilk
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
no
doubt
due
to
the
nitro
can
that
turns
a
bit
thin
towards
the
end
as
with
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
bland
with
notes
of
caramelized
malts
and
fruit
with
only
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
a
decent
brew
but
fairly
boring
its
the
only
irish
cream
ale
i
was
found
so
theres
nothing
to
compare
this
to
copper
colored
with
an
offwhite
cascading
creamy
head
and
trails
of
lingering
lace
the
aroma
is
tealike
and
wet
mowed
lawn
the
mediumfull
malt
is
slightly
mealy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
tealike
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
well
proportioned
to
the
maltiness
slightly
metallic
and
a
trace
of
citrus
flavors
really
smooth
and
balanced
drinkability
the
nitro
widget
tries
to
raise
the
bar
for
this
rather
mediocre
beer
with
only
limited
success
the
nitro
device
is
better
applied
in
youngs
luxury
double
chocolate
stout
or
youngs
oatmeal
stout
overall
this
is
a
fairly
weak
uninteresting
beer
its
drinkable
but
really
why
a
nice
session
ale
pass
the
darts
and
what
did
you
say
about
me
sainted
mother
f
bottom
line
might
not
be
worth
a
premium
unless
your
enamored
with
the
widget
can
but
an
easydrinking
beautifullooking
beer
looks
good
and
its
easy
to
drink
but
thats
about
all
this
brew
has
going
for
it
i
hadnt
had
a
wexford
in
a
while
but
remembered
it
having
much
more
flavour
in
the
past
the
flavour
is
definitely
lacking
here
hints
of
caramel
and
maybe
a
bit
of
a
buttery
taste
but
at
times
i
felt
like
i
was
just
drinking
creamy
water
if
that
makes
any
sense
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
solid
head
that
lasts
as
expected
wa
nitro
its
very
creamy
but
not
overly
thick
not
a
bad
brew
but
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
silken
with
a
light
body
taste
begins
with
a
subtle
bavarian
wheat
phenolic
character
quickly
fades
into
a
metallic
note
and
ends
with
a
very
wet
soft
mildly
roasted
malt
finish
with
no
noticeable
hop
aroma
flavor
or
bitterness
very
drinkable
not
at
all
complex
meant
to
be
drank
in
mass
quantities
this
cream
ale
is
super
smooth
and
reeks
of
drink
me
all
night
quality
the
best
cream
ale
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
the
head
quite
creamy
in
texture
the
size
modest
and
the
lace
quite
fine
and
adequate
to
cover
the
glass
malt
aromas
dominate
the
slightly
sweet
nose
start
is
also
sweet
and
the
top
skeletal
finish
is
sparsely
hopped
little
if
any
carbonation
this
was
not
unexpected
due
to
the
style
dry
aftertaste
average
and
leaves
me
wanting
to
sample
that
great
big
bad
boy
barley
wine
in
the
fridge
hopefully
tonight
after
all
the
family
christmas
cheer
has
subsided
to
a
dull
roar
and
im
back
home

on
the
keys

not

as
some

some

in

some

than

from

nice

any

feel
and

no

and
good
with

i
paired
this
with
a
pork

with
carmel
apples
mashed
potatoes
and
vegetables
i
dont
think
it
stands

very
well

are
of
tradingcard
bubble

honey
warm

flavors
are
a
sweet
blend
of

tropical

honey
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
give
the
hedonistic
elements
a
little
thrust
and
shape
smooth
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
not
superimpressed
with
this
ale
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
though
the
nitrocans
down
here
can
go
through
hell
sometimes
it
wasnt
badbut
was
lacking
in
tastearoma
and
had
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
for
a
cream
ale
i
think
i
will
change
glasses
also
to
try
and
get
the
head
to
stay
up
a
little
longer
and
also
trap
a
little
nitrogen
i
think
that
may
have
contributed
to
the
watery
feel
once
the
nitrohead
has
settled
theres
a
clear
amber
body
topped
by
a
firmly
creamy
textured
and
creamywhite
colored
head
that
holds
extremely
well
but
leaves
no
lace
still
very
nice
to
look
at
throughout
the
pint
the
aroma
is
of
a
very
light
caramel
maltiness
and
some
rich
earthy
hops
the
bodys
is
light
and
the
carbonation
level
is
well
restricted
1
9
volumes
co2
giving
an
amazingly
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
softly
malty
and
fruity
throughout
the
palate
finishing
only
lightly
dry
and
barely
noticeable
with
a
long
lingering
maltiness
and
some
earthy
hops
although
some
might
argue
that
theres
not
enough
character
here
i
feel
it
makes
one
nice
sweet
creamy
pint
although
it
may
become
too
sweet
with
a
few
in
a
row
as
a
session
beer
hence
a
lower
drinkablility
nitro
can
adds
to
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
detracts
from
taste
a
decent
dose
of
bittering
hops
but
they
cant
hide
a
somewhat
cloying
dry
finish
not
a
beer
to
seek
out
very
similar
to
caffreys
in
appearance
and
taste
but
i
thought
this
was
slightly
better
very
creamy
with
a
longlasting

during
the

just
a

is
the

the

could
have
used

hops
to
better
balance
the

some
fruitiness
in
the
mix
a

to

great

just
not
a

cream
ales
are
not
a
style
that
will
turn
heads
but
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
like
o
drinkable
and
bright
an
easy
tipper
with
decent
balance
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grass
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grass
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
another
disappointment
from
sun
king
overall
a
45
because
of
its
consistency
in
taste
and
appearance
but
not
a
favorite
beer
for
most
people
i
am
sure
i
have
said
it
many
times
but
i
will
say
it
again
we
need
more
cream
ales
out
there
they
arent
all
going
to
be
world
class
but
its
a
nice
refreshing
drink
and
definitely
underrepresented
on
the
beer
scene
this
one
is
very
light
but
still
maintains
a
classic
frothy
mouthfeel
and
bright
carbonation
there
is
indeed
a
milky
sweetness
to
this
that
hints
at
cornlike
sugar
but
the
finish
is
still
clean
im
missing
a
little
body
here
and
also
some
balancing
hops
for
bitterness
but
i
really
like
the
drinkability
and
the
package
four
pack
of
pint
cans
a
very
good
dose
this
is
nothing
earth
shattering
but
it
is
a
useful
brew
good
blonde
beer
for
colder
weather
too
as
it
has
a
little
meat
to
it
despite
the
thinner
body
of
the
handful
of
beers
i
have
had
from
sun
king
this
is
not
the
highest
quality
but
one
of
the
ones
i
appreciate
the
most
let
cream
ales
live
on
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
non
persistent
creamy
white
head
which
receded
quickly
highly
carbonated
aroma
of
biscuits
bread
raw
donut
dought
yeast
taste
dominated
by
breadiness
some
biscuit
malt
no
bitterness
but
not
sweet
finished
somewhat
clean
high
carbonation
tingling
refreshing
quite
a
lingering
bready
aftertaste
this
beer
is
definitely
their
introductory
beer
or
for
people
that
are
not
into
strong
tasting
beer
the
appearance
was
a
clear
yellow
and
fizzy
had
about
two
fingers
worth
of
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
i
really
didnt
pick
up
much
on
a
smell
the
taste
was
just
ok
it
was
kind
of
bland
it
was
nice
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
it
was
pretty
smooth
but
it
definitely
isnt
the
quality
that
i
have
been
trying
recently
the
color
is
a
light
orange
to
a
yellow
the
smell
had
a
citrustype
of
feel
it
wasnt
anything
that
special
since
different
people
like
different
things
i
would
read
multiple
reviews
to
see
if
you
should
try
it
for
yourself
overall
was
let
down
id
rather
drink
gennese
cream
ale
seriously
poured
from
pint
can
to
pint
glass
how
convenient
nice
golden
yellow
with
bright
twofinger
head
that
runs
away
fairly
quickly
with
little
lacing
no
huge
aroma
smells
fresh
almost
like
sea
spray
very
smooth
on
the
palate
nothing
jumps
up
and
grabs
you
but
the
malt
is
probably
predominant
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
anything
no
hops
to
speak
of
this
reminds
me
of
listening
to
the
indy
500
in
the
garage
with
my
dad
in
the
early
70s
and
being
allowed
to
take
one
swig
of
his
beer
nice
not
the
greatest
i
ever
had
or
the
most
complex
but
would
definitely
buy
again
good
to
have
on
hand
to
serve
at
a
cookout
to
those
who
think
bud
light
is
good
beer
note
i
was
a
little
bit
surprised
by
this
it
was
better
then
i
expected
and
i
always
like
that
can
pours
a
clear
and
very
dark
golden
color
with
effectively
no
head
on
it
nose
has
some
corn
notes
to
it
and
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
traditional
lager
taste
is
actually
fairly
crisp
and
not
too
lagery
and
without
the
eerie
sweetness
i
feared
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
a
great
cream
ale
it
has
some
nice
flavors
that
all
blend
and
compliment
each
other
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
here
and
there
to
add
freshness
to
the
flavor
but
it
says
dry
making
it
very
sessionable
as
the
summer
heats
up
this
becomes
more
and
more
sessionable
not
a
particularly
memorable
beer
but
easy
to
drink
add
it
all
up
and
it
comes
out
to
be
an
average
brew
personal
rate
2
75
taste
is
expectedly
light
and
creamy
this
one
is
sooo
smooth
and
malty
but
very
drinkable
and
as
the
can
imparts
approachable
sunlight
cream
ale
wouldnt
turn
away
lifetime
macro
drinkers
but
has
plenty
of
easygoing
flavor
for
craft
nerds
too
a
solid
and
totally
sessionworthy
brew
here
not
too
complex
but
smooth
and
wellcrafted
to
style
o
very
solid
cream
ale
spotted
cow
is
a
touch
better
as
the
lager
flavor
profiles
come
out
a
little
more
in
this
beer
giving
a
sweetness
that
is
just
ok
oa
nice
light
session
beer
however
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
a
tad
too
light
to
my
tastes
light
to
medium
body
no
traces
of
alcohol
this
is
made
for
quaffing
which
is
no
problem
a
very
simple
beer
take
it
for
what
it
is
o
overall
decent
summer
beer
but
i
wont
get
this
one
for
the
price
overall
i
just
think
it
is
to
much
for
such
a
basic
beer
o
this
beer
lacks
creativity
and
really
has
no
place
in
the
craft
market
i
dont
understand
why
anyone
would
drink
this
if
there
was
a
0
for
the
5
categories
this
would
receive
0s
from
me
the
smell
uh
if
smell
is
were
the
majority
of
taste
comes
from
thats
diffidently
not
a
plus
here
appearance
not
what
i
think
any
beer
should
look
like
taste
none
the
only
taste
is
a
cringing
metallic
taste
palate
there
is
none
you
would
think
something
that
has
cream
in
the
title
would
have
some
body
however
this
is
pure
water
constancy
the
bjcp
defines
a
cream
ale
as
clean
wellattenuated
american
lawnmower
beer
and
id
say
sun
king
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
smooth
crisp
easydrinking
with
enough
subtle
malthop
flavor
to
keep
the
session
interesting
missing
out
on
brilliant
clarity
but
otherwise
not
much
these
guys
can
do
to
improve
o
terrific
session
beer
for
warmer
days
hope
to
get
this
one
again
decent
beer
for
style
goes
for
a
northwest
style
golden
ale
mouthfeel
is
the
biggest
step
up
it
has
all
of
the
light
characteristics
of
a
standard
lighter
body
ale
or
lager
but
it
actually
has
a
creamy
feel
to
it
extremely
drinkable
though
has
a
good
thing
going
here
i
like
this
and
glad
to
try
something
from
sun
king
not
the
best
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
thanks
huadog
for
the
sweet
extra
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
definetly
what
i
would
classify
as
a
bbq
beer
nothing
great
but
i
wouldnt
mind
kicking
back
with
several
of
these
thebeeralmanac
com
mouthfeel
light
body
slight
carbonation
with
a
malt
flavor
that
lingers
for
a
bit
then
dissipates
leaving
no
aftertaste
pours
a
yellow
color
with
very
good
clarity
1
finger
head
that
quickly
fades
and
leaves
nothing
behind
nose
has
some
hops
and
grains
present
but
nothing
more
taste
is
pretty
smooth
and
enjoyable
has
some
sourness
to
it
and
malts
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
decent
carbonation
from
the
tap
overall
a
decent
beer
exceptionaly
easy
drinking
beer
low
hops
make
it
a
great
everyday
beer
crisp
light
flavor
with
out
a
strong
after
taste
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
for
guests
watching
a
baseball
game
or
just
to
quench
your
thirst
on
those
hot
days
around
a
barbecue
it
is
a
step
above
adjunct
lagers
but
some
hops
could
of
made
this
a
much
more
interesting
beer
overy
good
example
of
the
style
would
try
again
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
thanks
to
jayblack
for
the
chance
to
revisit
in
the
can
o
to
me
this
is
the
essence
of
mediocrity
in
craft
beer
unimpressive
flavor
wrapped
in
the
shell
of
a
unique
style
sorry
guys
but
this
is
one
of
the
weaker
beers
ive
tasted
from
indianapolis
own
not
undrinkable
but
not
worth
seeking
out
o
super
drinkable
i
was
hesitant
to
crack
this
thinking
i
wouldnt
like
it
but
if
it
was
available
itd
be
a
go
to
summer
beer
best
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
o
a
nice
transition
beer
though
im
at
a
point
where
i
look
for
more
it
was
plenty
refreshing
and
i
could
see
myself
revisiting
on
a
very
warm
day
out
by
the
pool
as
this
isnt
overbearing
but
has
a
nice
abv
to
it
would
have
like
more
of
the
creamy
sweetness
though
the
velvety
feel
in
the
mouth
made
me
happy
i
tried
this
o
a
solid
beer
and
a
perfect
summer
dayknock
back
a
sixpack
kind
of
beer
would
definitely
drink
more
as
i
poured
this
beer
into
the
glass
it
looked
a
little
pale
to
me
as
i
drank
the
beer
it
tasted
just
as
bland
i
never
got
a
strong
enough
taste
with
the
4
that
i
drank
to
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
it
other
than
just
that
it
was
flavorless
there
was
a
little
creaminess
to
it
but
very
little
i
am
a
big
sun
king
fan
but
this
is
a
weaker
beer
of
theirs
overall
this
a
summer
beer
in
every
sense
of
the
word
not
very
complex
but
after
reading
the
can
i
dont
think
its
intended
to
be
like
it
says
a
nice
gateway
into
craft
beer
highly
drinkable
this
sprightly
ale
is
ideal
for
the
heat
of
mid
july
it
has
enough
flavor
and
character
to
keep
it
interesting
from
beginning
to
end
the
mouthfeel
was
interesting
rich
and
smooth
but
with
a
coarseness
in
the
carbonation
overall
nothing
really
stands
out
too
much
here
but
its
a
nice
smooth
refreshing
summer
type
cream
ale
much
better
session
option
than
a
mbc
on
a
hot
sunny
day
id
definitely
have
this
again
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
lawnmower
beer
very
light
and
crisp
but
still
actually
contains
flavor
o
this
beer
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
i
just
like
a
bit
more
flavour
in
by
brew
overall
a
decent
beer
good
for
summer
easy
drinking
but
it
was
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
expected
o
couldnt
quite
tell
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
a
bmc
very
disappointing
do
very
easy
drinking
refreshing
good
lawnmower
beer
thanks
again
dannyfrost
for
the
sun
king
o
not
terribly
interesting
but
not
much
wrong
with
it
either
o
good
cream
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
refreshing
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
definitely
has
good
drinkability
it
slides
down
the
throat
easily
and
is
definitely
a
thirstquencher
drinkability
is
not
good
not
a
drain
pour
just
a
flavorless
beer
i
will
try
to
enjoy
the
other
3
while
watching
some
basketballbaseball
game
drinkabililty
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
solid
cream
ale
light
and
a
better
alternative
than
macro
lagers
shiny
goldenyellow
color
lively
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
which
keeps
the
head
intact
smells
of
wholegrain
cereal
with
the
additions
of
wheat
and
oats
fermentation
twang
and
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
crispness
lays
into
the
lighter
but
slick
body
clean
and
grainy
with
a
dry
doughy
wholegrain
bready
flavor
hops
rest
a
modest
bitterness
on
the
palate
yet
are
big
enough
to
balance
drying
finish
has
a
clean
linger
of
grain
a
tasty
canned
treat
a
lunchtime
pounder
craft
tallboys
ftw
this
is
a
lighter
beer
that
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
drinkable
uhm
seriously
yes
quite
a
refreshing
beer
yet
still
has
enough
going
on
flavorwise
to
be
able
to
enjoy
reviewing
it
this
little
brewery
seems
to
do
all
the
little
things
right
and
is
making
some
tasty
nonextreme
styles
quite
well
from
what
i
can
tell
so
far
seek
this
one
out
if
you
can
get
it
you
get
more
bang
for
your
buck
alcohol
and
flavorsenjoyedbybeerdork
wise
with
most
any
other
craft
beer
offering
but
its
hard
to
match
sunlights
intense
taste
and
easy
drinking
would
gladly
pay
the
premium
to
drink
this
over
any
other
light
tasting
beer
in
the
warmer
months
please
distribute
this
more
widely
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
beer
which
is
one
thing
i
like
about
these
kinds
of
beers
worked
well
on
a
hot
day
at
the
bruery
sunlight
cream
ale
is
the
microbrewing
equivalent
of
insisting
that
picasso
paint
something
recognizable
just
to
prove
he
had
the
technical
skills
to
make
representational
art
artisinal
brewing
is
just
that
subjective
aesthetic
and
about
gathering
an
appreciative
audience
if
you
or
anyone
you
know
doubts
that
micro
brewers
can
handle
the
demands
of
brewing
a
light
tasty
satisfying
beer
give
them
one
of
these
and
then
pop
open
an
osiris
after
an
osiris
i
had
to
try
the
other
sun
king
canned
offering
and
while
it
is
a
technical
achievement
and
stand
out
for
its
precision
smoothness
and
execution
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
cream
ale
it
brings
back
memories
of
school
in
binghamton
new
york
eating
hot
wings
at
the
sportsmans
club
and
rathskeller
and
washing
down
the
franks
redhot
with
genny
gennesee
cream
ale
not
a
bad
memory
but
also
not
the
height
of
brewings
olympus
either
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
the
tall
boy
cans
will
keep
give
me
a
little
more
time
before
going
back
to
the
cooler
which
means
more
time
for
a
multitude
of
backyard
games
d
a
good
light
beer
to
mix
it
up
with
during
the
summer
months
crisp
and
dry
and
just
an
allaround
easy
to
drink
beer
my
initial
pour
netted
me
two
fingers
worth
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
fizzled
and
popped
its
way
out
of
existence
color
was
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
very
malty
sweet
and
adjunctfree
it
is
nice
to
smell
an
allmalt
beer
every
once
in
a
while
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
very
clean
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
would
be
curious
to
know
what
hops
were
used
since
its
bitterness
is
almost
nonexistent
finish
was
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
approachable
for
novice
craft
beer
drinkers
a
solid
candidate
for
the
cooler
on
the
way
to
the
beach
definitely
seek
this
out
d
my
first
reviewed
cream
ale
from
the
look
at
the
rest
of
the
scores
it
is
not
an
appreciated
or
well
liked
style
however
in
my
opinion
this
one
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
ones
worried
it
was
gonna
be
like
genese
cream
ale
however
i
think
its
much
more
complex
this
was
definitley
decent
for
a
cream
ale
with
a
little
more
a
hop
profile
to
it
which
helped
add
a
bit
more
flavor
and
crispness
not
sure
if
this
is
worth
the
same
10
per
4pack
price
as
the
osirus
but
its
still
a
good
one
to
keep
chilled
in
the
fridge
and
then
go
to
town
on
during
those
hot
summmer
months
for
all
of
my
distaste
for
the
cream
ale
genre
i
am
absolutely
100
all
my
heart
rooting
for
the
fellas
at
sun
king
so
if
youre
at
all
curious
about
their
canned
cream
ale
go
out
and
buy
some
theyre
definitely
on
to
something
im
upping
my
scores
after
trying
it
on
tap
with
a
fresher
pallet
it
was
fabulous
easily
the
best
cream
ive
ever
had
overall
this
would
be
a
very
nice
light
ale
if
it
wasnt
for
the
mustiness
dragging
it
down
there
really
isnt
anything
offensive
nor
is
there
anything
of
merit
im
not
even
sure
if
i
would
be
able
to
pick
this
out
in
a
blind
taste
test
vs
a
group
of
american
adjunct
lagers
overall
this
is
a
nice
intro
beer
for
people
first
getting
into
craft
its
good
for
warm
weather
but
i
believe
that
this
beer
is
best
out
of
a
can
im
a
fan
of
porters
stouts
and
ipas
but
sometimes
you
just
want
a
clean
crisp
beer
this
fit
the
bill
pretty
well
i
got
a
can
at
an
indianapolis
indians
game
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
foamy
head
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
good
clean
hop
finish
makes
this
a
great
summer
session
beer
i
usually
attend
two
or
three
indians
games
a
month
so
hopefully
they
continue
to
sell
this
the
osiris
pale
ale
and
the
victory
amber
pours
with
a
white
head
that
hangs
around
1
5
fingers
thick
its
light
golden
color
the
smell
is
of
light
malt
balanced
almost
perfectly
with
hop
aroma
the
first
sip
reflects
the
smell
exactly
light
malty
goodness
balanced
with
hops
have
to
say
that
this
is
hoppy
than
other
cream
ales
i
have
had
its
definetly
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
the
a
sunny
day
out
on
the
deck
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
big
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
untoasted
grain
and
mild
floral
hops
this
is
by
no
means
a
hoppy
beer
but
is
still
the
hoppiest
example
of
the
style
ive
encountered
light
grainy
flavors
with
a
splash
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
finishes
squeaky
clean
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
pours
a
very
nice
light
yellow
with
some
nice
head
and
lacing
very
competing
scents
between
the
malt
body
and
the
english
hops
fuggle
very
jerkyhop
flavor
with
the
hops
running
wild
over
the
malt
decent
malt
backbone
with
a
decent
sweetness
but
wouldve
been
better
with
less
hops
goes
down
fine
nothing
great
nothing
bad
pint
at
leonardos
pizza
in
gainesville
taking
hadley
on
a
tour
of
the
campus
and
then
to
see
a
christmas
carol
at
the
hippodrome
overall
my
impression
of
wild
night
is
summed
up
in
the
fact
that
i
will
continue
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
have
a
gallon
growler
from
swamphead
and
i
will
be
filling
it
frequently
with
this
o
best
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
on
tap
at
vellos
pours
yellow
with
creamy
heqd
very
light
colored
on
both
counts
sweet
honey
citrus
smell
flavor
is
sweet
but
light
malts
with
a
rather
dirty
lingering
dusty
finish
light
body
and
refreshing
as
a
whole
but
the
finish
takes
away
from
it
poured
light
yellow
probably
straw
colored
white
scanty
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
a
touch
of
corn
and
light
grains
with
a
hint
of
metallicness
pears
and
grass
but
all
of
this
is
extremely
light
flavor
is
very
hard
to
distinguish
rather
bland
and
not
much
to
the
beer
not
offensive
but
nothing
really
standing
out
either
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
session
beer
but
i
dont
even
think
it
falls
in
those
parameters
i
would
just
stick
to
their
big
nose
ipa
and
midnight
oil
stout
that
is
where
the
flavor
is
overall
these
cream
ales
always
taste
more
lagerlike
to
me
i
really
have
to
focus
to
get
the
cream
part
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
done
well
overall
a
nice
and
solid
beer
nothing
out
of
the
norm
though
on
tap
at
cigar
city
a
little
floral
honey
rather
plain
cream
ale
a
little
hallertau
hops
flavour
a
bit
of
honey
golden
colour
a
little
white
head
a
tad
meady
and
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
like
a
light
mead
i
would
rather
put
some
new
zealand
honey
in
hot
water
and
skip
the
carbonation
part
oswamp
head
ive
heard
much
about
them
but
im
guessing
this
isnt
their
top
beer
this
is
a
lawn
mower
beer
but
not
a
great
one
there
are
no
negative
tastes
but
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
either
ontap
at
the
tasting
room
amber
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
smell
is
pale
malt
cereal
grains
fairly
neutral
taste
is
grainy
mild
hopping
finishing
with
a
sugary
honey
sweetness
very
slight
rindy
hopping
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
featuring
the
honey
but
unfortunately
is
otherwise
boring
inoffensive
and
probably
useful
as
a
gateway
beer
wouldnt
expect
a
cream
ale
to
be
particularly
exciting
anyway
d
dumbed
down
version
of
the
style
id
try
any
other
swamphead
before
this
one
as
i
do
tend
to
enjoy
their
brews
drinkability
i
tried
this
at
the
kickbacks
swamphead
dinner
among
many
others
this
brewery
in
new
and
going
in
the
right
direction
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
catherines
passion
russian
imperial
stout
infused
with
organic
cocoa
nibs
and
midnight
oil
coffee
da
light
easy
drinking
quality
brew
all
of
the
swamphead
beers
i
feel
fit
in
to
this
catagory
accept
the
101010
that
guys
more
of
a
world
beater
but
wild
night
keeps
its
place
as
a
great
middle
of
the
road
drinking
option
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
refreshing
the
sweetness
and
thin
body
make
this
a
perfect
summer
beer
pretty
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
of
which
there
are
many
in
florida
d
a
good
beach
beer
perhaps
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
super
high
due
to
the
light
character
of
the
brew
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
sample
this
would
be
a
great
session
brew
sitting
by
the
pool
or
at
a
baseball
game
cant
wait
to
try
more
swamphead
skal
pours
a
rich
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malt
citrus
honey
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
malt
with
a
faint
honeylike
sweetness
citrus
and
a
nice
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
balancing
out
the
sweetness
very
nicely
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
a
beer
from
this
brewery
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
lineup
great
creamy
feel
that
they
were
going
for
unfortunately
they
forgot
the
rest
in
the
process
pours
a
thin
yellow
with
a
little
bit
of
fizz
the
scent
is
sweet
with
malt
and
almost
no
hop
scents
coming
through
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
interesting
with
a
thicker
style
cream
ale
that
had
a
very
mellow
flavor
easy
drinking
with
a
lot
of
substance
to
it
made
for
an
enjoyable
evening
with
this
beer
overall
some
of
the
advertising
copy
for
this
beer
mentions
that
its
good
for
duckpin
bowling
so
i
was
bound
to
like
it
as
a
lifelong
duckpinner
that
aside
its
really
a
terrific
everyday
session
beer
basic
enough
to
appeal
to
any
palate
crafty
enough
to
appeal
to
the
more
sophisticated
beerman
one
of
my
beers
of
choice
for
events
where
i
know
im
going
to
be
hosting
large
groups
because
its
cheap
and
reliable
too
this
beer
is
good
great
for
someone
just
getting
into
craft
beers
and
learning
the
styles
o
overall
a
solid
cream
ale
nothing
fancy
but
gets
the
job
done
overall
a
nice
and
clean
lager
nothing
mid
blowing
and
complex
but
solid
this
is
a
beer
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
i
would
not
turn
down
either

a

this
shows
more
character
than
most
versions
that
are
true
to
this
style
balance
and
drinkability
seem
to
be
the
prime
directives
here
both
of
which
they
nailed
based
on
having
three
great
past
beers
from
these
guys
im
sad
that
this
one
takes
me
aback
a
bit
its
refreshing
and
works
well
on
its
own
cold
and
maybe
paired
with
bar
food
but
its
simplified
with
bizarre
nuances
such
as
the
bittered
bite
at
the
finish
to
the
point
where
it
wouldnt
be
something
i
could
have
as
casually
as
i
wished
perhaps
its
too
toned
down
even
to
style
for
better
for
worse
it
definitely
lacks
the
charm
that
makes
their
summer
ale
highly
drinkable
too
bad
but
glad
i
could
try
it
i
like
to
compare
beers
to
metal
bands
if
the
naragansett
cream
ale
was
a
metal
band
it
would
be
killer

comwatchv9b6mpmd58y
overall
very
nice
take
on
the
cream
ale
style
a
little
smoother
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
is
all
i
see
missing
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
gold
a
nice
fingerwidth
of
white
froth
sits
on
top
decent
lace
left
behind
after
each
sip
the
aroma
is
grassy
slightly
floral
and
sweet
hay
lemon
good
carbonation
not
too
thin
but
definitely
an
easy
one
to
quaff
grassy
hops
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
but
there
is
a
slight
buttery
creaminess
that
smooths
the
edges
out
mild
bready
aftertaste
this
was
what
i
expected
it
to
be
a
nice
refreshing
tasty
ale
i
really
enjoy
what
these
guys
put
out
rjt
o
a
simple
great
beer
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
regularly
in
chicago
d
chuggable
pretty
good
stuff
considering
what
it
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
where
it
comes
from
etc
a
really
solid
cheap
beer
fills
the
pint
glass
beautifully
a
golden
body
with
a
two
finger
bone
white
cap
good
retention
with
some
clingy
lace
the
nose
is
of
cereallike
grains
and
some
bitter
earthy
hops
corn
sweetness
and
some
undercooked
bread
are
also
present
on
the
palate
corn
sweetness
and
undercooked
white
bread
lead
the
way
before
a
decent
hop
bitterness
helps
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
mid
palate
however
more
corncereal
grain
sweetness
comes
back
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
smooth
crisp
beer
with
a
drying
finish
a
pretty
good
cream
ale
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
with
a
pretty
excellent
price
point
o
not
too
much
to
say
on
this
one
tastes
like
a
normal
gansett
lager
but
with
more
malts
and
hops
that
said
its
a
nice
beer
especially
for
a
hot
day
not
sure
about
9
for
6
pints
though
id
rather
save
the
3
and
just
get
the
lager
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
have
again
found
this
on
the
cape
and
couldnt
resist
especially
when
i
say
it
was
now
made
by
the
rochester
brewing
company
price
point
didnt
hurt
under
6
00
for
a
six
of
pounder
cans
all
that
being
said
i
think
this
is
pretty
much
genny
cream
ale
in
a
different
package
ill
be
eager
to
do
a
side
by
side
taste
test
however
until
then
check
my
review
of
genny
cream
ale
for
this
ones
specifics
pours
golden
light
active
bubbles
good
head
of
remaining
foam
chalky
malty
nose
smooth
lagery
beer
taste
citrus
close
creamy
mouthfeel
mild
mannered
if
not
a
touch
sour
good
clean
fun
though
hardly
remarkable
o
a
really
well
done
cream
ale
way
to
take
a
simple
style
and
kick
it
up
a
notch
wish
more
brewers
would
experiament
with
this
style
perfect
for
a
warm
night
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
other
than
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
cookout
beer
that
can
be
consumed
one
after
another
pours
a
lightly
hazed
pale
straw
fizzy
faint
scent
brings
notes
of
white
bread
fresh
grain
taste
a
tad
more
strong
than
scent
lightly
bready
and
grainy
faint
grassy
hop
notes
nice
smooth
and
clean
body
with
some
heft
good
refreshing
beer
to
pair
with
the
bbq
we
were
eating
would
only
seek
out
as
a
bmc
alternative
as
its
scent
and
flavor
are
not
too
strong
pours
out
a
bubbly
golden
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
creamy
and
lightly
malty
the
taste
is
excellent
and
just
about
exactly
what
id
want
from
a
cream
ale
its
got
a
nice
creaminess
and
grainiess
but
its
got
the
right
amount
of
bitter
hops
to
stop
it
from
being
cloying
while
letting
the
cream
aspects
shine
through
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
briskly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
this
is
just
a
great
cream
ale
an
outstanding
example
of
a
macro
style
done
with
a
craft
level
of
care
first
impression
is
of
the
thinnish
body
but
the
lower
carbonation
gives
the
impression
of
a
richer
beer
than
it
is
good
hop
presence
this
is
a
good
beer
without
the
low
hop
typical
for
a
cream
ale
a
definite
move
up
from
the
lawn
mower
beer
category
i
didnt
hate
this
but
there
are
far
better
versions
of
the
style
o
overall
man
oh
man
ive
had
my
fair
share
of
cream
ales
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
this
really
really
is
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
session
beer
with
a
good
light
feel
to
it
great
summer
beer
its
better
on
the
warmer
side
which
will
bring
out
slight
fruit
to
the
finish
overall
drink
it
from
the
can
drink
it
from
the
glass
it
doesnt
matter
its
a
beer
for
drinking
en
masse
on
a
warm
day
i
plan
on
doing
this
routinely
poured
from
a
tallboy
into
a
true
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
crystal
clear
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
half
inch
of
light
fluffy
white
foam
that
slowly
settles
into
a
filmy
coating
and
laces
the
glass
as
you
drink
aromas
are
roasted
and
creamy
with
a
subtle
sweetness
that
compliments
the
biscuits
backbone
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
dark
almost
char
highlight
on
the
sweet
and
subtle
creamy
characteristics
toasted
grain
flavors
throughout
with
a
slight
sour
tang
to
it
the
body
is
light
and
smooth
until
the
end
when
the
carbonation
gets
the
best
of
the
beer
leaving
a
slight
sharp
finish
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
a
subtle
roasted
sweetness
that
remains
light
tasty
beer
o
a
good
tasting
and
sessionable
brew
with
enough
citrus
and
bittereness
to
keep
it
interesting
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
id
go
to
in
this
summerday
easydrinkin
low
abv
range
but
its
worth
checking
out
from
the
16
fl
oz
can
marked
04120431
sampled
on
april
20
2012
the
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
full
of
pale
malts
and
grain
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
the
emphasis
on
medium
and
it
is
also
smooth
the
taste
has
a
definite
grainy
character
but
it
is
not
offensive
there
is
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
a
delightful
cream
ale
supposedly
based
on
a
preprohibition
recipe
overall
drinkable
not
memorable
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
notes
well
its
very
light
and
decently
drinkable
it
will
do
very
well
on
a
very
warm
spring
or
summer
day
cheers
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
it
isnt
its
not
incredibly
awesome
but
its
for
sure
a
step
up
from
the
regular
gansett
lager
i
still
much
prefer
their
seasonals
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
is
an
ok
lawnmower
brew
but
not
one
i
will
repeat
it
is
back
to
wexford
for
me
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
sessionable
and
enjoyable
for
a
beer
company
that
i
remember
having
a
kind
of
bad
reputation
in
my
childhood
for
cheap
crappy
beer
i
was
surprised
and
happy
that
i
tried
it
o
would
be
o
k
on
a
scorching
hot
day
in
place
of
water
easy
to
drink
but
bland
and
rather
tasteless
not
horrible
but
not
memorable
either
an
american
macro
without
the
crap
no
gross
aftertaste
clean
it
is
boring
o
a
newengland
throwback
style
from
a
relative
throwback
brewery
gansett
cream
ale
is
the
5
abv
light
ale
for
the
macrolager
lover
in
your
life
i
can
see
sitting
on
a
boat
deck
sipping
away
on
it
in
the
summertime
waiting
for
my
reel
to
bob
in
the
water
might
as
well
save
a
few
bucks
run
with
the
lager
though
a
really
good
everyday
beer
when
you
just
want
something
tasty
and
drinkable
the
only
competitive
advantage
that
genesee
cream
ale
has
is
that
its
still
cheaper
than
narragansett
cream
ale
i
will
take
the
latter
though
because
its
easier
to
drink
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
real
easy
one
to
enjoy
ill
probably
keep
these
guys
on
hand
for
when
i
want
something
easy
to
enjoy
honestly
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
until
i
had
it
a
few
times
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
i
guess
i
like
this
about
as
much
as
narragansett
lager
sadly
its
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
seasonal
offerings
overall
it
is
worth
drinking
if
you
like
the
lager
and
want
something
just
a
bit
more
complex
other
than
that
i
would
pass
o
a
very
simple
cream
ale
that
has
nothing
offensive
going
on
but
for
that
matter
not
much
going
on
at
all
its
good
but
like
i
said
very
simple
and
plain
taste
starts
sweet
pale
citrus
bite
in
the
middle
with
crisp
bitterness
to
the
close
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
drinkability
is
easy
good
stuff
convenient
packaging
nice
price
classic
fall
back
brew
pours
clear
yet
darker
than
a
traditional
lagerlight
ale
foam
did
persist
and
lacing
was
solid
the
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
lemon
a
refreshing
tasting
ale
with
solid
carbination
a
mild
hop
and
smooth
this
is
an
above
average
everyday
lawnmower
beer
o
only
the
second
cream
ale
ive
had
other
than
genesee
cream
ale
and
this
beer
is
most
definitely
better
than
that
solid
lawnmower
style
for
hotter
days
overall
this
is
a
fine
lighter
beer
its
not
trying
to
be
something
great
it
doesnt
need
to
just
got
a
sixer
of
tallboys
for
8
dollars
pours
with
a
nice
frothy
head
no
spectacular
smell
to
speak
of
but
boy
oh
boy
what
a
great
mouthfeel
nice
and
creamy
flavor
is
pretty
good
seems
to
be
stuck
in
that
nonlight
beer
light
flavor
category
minimal
hop
bitterness
but
still
a
good
flavor
throughout
i
like
it
now
but
i
suspect
in
the
summer
ill
be
pounding
these
regularly
definitely
better
than
its
contemporaries
wexfords
genny
cream
bit
of
trivia
the
cans
are
made
in
new
york
but
the
draft
beer
is
produced
by
providences
trinity
brewhouse
im
eager
to
try
that
as
well
regardless
im
happy
for
creams
year
round
availability
very
creamy
in
your
mouth
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
snd
the
hops
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
real
nice
creamed
corn
and
hop
bitterness
flavor
this
is
old
school
cream
ale
from
back
when
i
was
young
not
a
hop
machine
but
a
really
flavorful
smooth
cream
ale
you
can
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
in
your
mouth
it
is
smooth
and
so
refreshing
and
finishes
with
a
nice
back
and
forth
sweet
and
bitter
taste
i
highly
recomend
trying
this
one
over
all
i
give
it
a
4
5
narragansett
sure
is
bringing
out
some
awesome
beers
you
can
just
picture
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
saturday
afternoon
16oz

14
inch
of
head
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
grains
malts
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
tastes
alot
like
the
narragansett
lager
but
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
hops
has
some
of
that
cream
ale
lactose
sweetness
to
it
light
mouthfeel
and
body
its
a
decent
beer
with
many
similarities
to
the
lager
not
the
best
of
gansetts
newest
line
of
beers
but
still
solid
and
worth
keeping
a
bunch
of
in
the
fridge
as
long
as
you
drink
it
cold
and
out
of
the
can
so
as
not
to
smell
the
off
aroma
i
can
see
this
being
good
summertime
swill
o
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
16oz

served

lovely
translucent

one
inch
tight
bright
white
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
consistent
skim
swaths
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
session
nose
is
very
subdued
light
grassy
notes
and
cereal
grains
tate
consistent
with
nose
however
a
noble
hops
presence
is
also
expressed
as
well
as
a
light
citrus
character
and
a
trace
of
something
metallic
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
that
leaves
a
residual
prickle
across
the
tongue
overall
a
really
solid
session
beer
at
a
great
price
i
can
see
adding
this
beer
to
my
budget
lineup
o
this
is
no
sweet
action
but
its
a
drinkable
enough
beer
and
will
presumably
go
down
pretty
easily
when
the
weather
is
warmer
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
and
crisp
golden
color
with
a
solid
foamy
white
head
probably
mediumhigh
carbonation
hoppier
in
both
aroma
and
taste
than
i
was
expecting
not
that
it
is
an
exceptionally
big
hop
presence
but
you
can
not
mistake
the
fact
that
it
is
there
nice
smooth
and
solid
hoppy
cream
ale
flavor
easy
drinking
really
a
great
session
ale
counter
point
to
their
standard
lager
will
definitely
be
purchasing
again
od
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
narragansett
they
will
never
blow
you
away
but
they
make
some
solid
stuff
this
is
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
it
is
not
a
slouch
i
could
see
this
being
a
brew
i
would
tote
around
especially
when
i
may
be
sharing
with
a
group
of
friends
who
arent
huge
craft
advocates
havent
had
many
cream
ales
but
this
is
a
pretty
decent
addition
to
their
lineup
not
much
of
a
head
light
colored
ale
lots
of
bubbles
nose
is
light
hoppy
creamy
pilsneresque
not
to
much
nose
though
very
nice
flavor
creamy
as
expected
lots
of
effervescence
big
bubbles
too
light
on
the
tongue
pilsner
type
hop
actually
off
you
had
told
me
this
was
a
lager
i
would
have
believed
you
easy
drinking
standard
as
far
as
cream
ale
is
concerned
reminds
me
of
when
we
used
to
drink
wexford
cream
ale
back
in
the
day
2003
solid
loved
this
beer
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
sipping
on
the
beach
trying
to
find
this
in
oregon
i
did
a
tasting
in
panama
and
everybody
loved
this
one
tastes
like
a
dry
cream
soda
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
fuller
bodied
than
a
cream
soda
which
would
make
this
a
nice
choice
when
you
want
to
fill
that
itch
the
vanilla
cream
notes
are
prevalent
this
isnt
very
light
tasting
refreshing
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
give
it
a
shot
aroma
is
a
little
offputting
but
the
taste
is
a
little
better
still
pretty
average
and
unremarkable
enjoyed
pretty
close
to
room
temp
probably
not
the
best
idea
this
beer
is
undeniably
very
smooth
and
creamy
smell
and
taste
wise
it
was
very
light
and
left
more
to
be
desired
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
but
as
of
my
first
impression
its
certainly
not
going
to
become
one
of
my
staples
very
creamy
tastes
way
better
than
it
smells
steady
even
flavor
tastes
exactly
like
it
should
and
as
i
hoped
it
would
has
nice
soap
sudsy
head
and
mild
hint
of
vanilla
goes
down
easy
and
i
dont
mind
it
as
a
session
beer
i
really
like
it
and
so
do
the
ladies
who
have
sampled
it
pretty
smooth
day
time
beer
nice
clear
golden
pour
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
to
set
a
palate
right
vanilla
is
the
main
flavor
and
finished
nicely
solid
if
your
a
cream
ale
enthusiast
smooth
and
refreshing
with
just
the
right
amount
of
vanilla
on
the
back
side
dark
gold
pour
hint
of
vanilla
at
the
end
of
the
sip
i
was
afraid
the
vanilla
would
be
overpowering
but
it
isnt
definite
recommend

b
easy
to
drink
this
is
quite
tasty
if
you
are
into
cream
soda
which
i
am
very
wellbalanced
light
to
medium
bodied
delicious
and
something
a
little
different
for
warmer
whether
beyond
the
session
ipas
wheat
beers
etc
overall
great
beer
if
you
like
a
sweet
beer
then
try
this
out
i
tried
this
because
it
seems
to
be
a
popular
item
where
i
work
and
ive
heard
good
things
about
mother
earth
brew
co
it
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
with
a
modest
head
the
smell
is
mild
and
pleasant
the
initial
aroma
is
faint
vanilla
that
gives
way
to
an
earthy
smell
i
cant
really
define
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
subtleyet
noticeablevanilla
flavor
the
taste
finishes
off
with
a
distinct
bready
characteristic
the
breadiness
in
the
aftertaste
is
unique
but
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
what
it
is
overall
this
is
a
solid
refreshing
beer
that
tastes
a
lot
like
cream
soda
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
if
you
need
a
break
from
some
of
more
robust
ales
out
there
in
fact
i
bought
this
cause
all
i
had
was
missions
dark
seas
imperial
stout
but
didnt
want
anything
heavy
overall
i
wish
the
vanilla
and
cream
were
more
pronounced
especially
on
the
nose
the
smell
is
very
earthy
and
grassy
and
unexpected
for
a
vanilla
cream
ale
this
is
an
extremely
malty
brew
almost
cloyingly
sweet
while
not
a
wow
brew
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
drink
again
especially
due
to
its
easy
availability
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
vanilla
the
candy
stick
that
comes
in
a
fun
dip
and
slight
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
vanilla
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
but
fairly
strong
vanilla
presence
all
around
poured
a
beautiful
deep
orangeamber
with
a
thin
ring
of
whit
head
it
looks
pretty
good
not
at
all
like
any
form
of
adjunct
lager
scent
is
very
sweet
with
heavy
notes
of
cream
maize
and
sweet
malt
its
a
simple
yet
pleasant
scent
like
a
cream
soda
or
vanilla
soda
flavor
follows
the
nose
very
sweet
heavy
sweet
cream
flavors
and
vanilla
laid
over
a
solid
backbone
of
sweet
malt
and
maybe
some
maize
adjuncts
with
a
moderate
level
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
that
balance
the
sweetness
the
end
of
the
sip
and
the
aftertaste
are
slightly
bitter
especially
for
the
beers
21
ibus
its
unique
has
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
bitter
and
the
vanilla
notes
are
excellent
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
it
drinks
smooth
and
creamy
as
it
should
quite
an
excellent
mouthfeel
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
has
a
nice
flavor
thats
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
balances
in
some
bitterness
it
has
a
pleasant
vanilla
heavy
scent
and
an
excellent
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
id
drink
this
one
again
cheers
overall
a
tasty
session
ale
not
sure
on
the
price
but
if
it
comes
in
around
5
for
a
bomber
then
well
worth
the
price
otherwise
not
really
worth
it
weird
time
of
year
to
release
this
one
in
the
bottle
definitely
more
of
a
springsummertime
allday
drinker
especially
at
5
2
abv
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
best
damn
for
6
50
label
printed
on
pretty
good
really
malty
with
a
slight
lager
taste
not
my
thing
but
alright
overall
creamy
texture
makes
it
so
easy
to
drink
but
still
has
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavors
to
keep
it
interesting
meh
not
a
fan
a
bit
off
overall
good
beer
light
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
complex
45
overall
i
still
need
more
cream
ales
on
my
resume
this
one
is
the
best
one
ive
had
yet
the
4
pack
o
pint
format
is
awesome
and
i
will
definately
be
purchasing
this
again
a
flavorful
vienna
cream
ale
a
definite
step
up
to
something
local
that
will
knock
boston
lager
or
a
karl
stauss
amber
off
its
perch
while
a
bit
too
heavy
to
session
this
hard
id
be
proud
hand
one
of
these
to
anyone
overall
this
was
my
favorite
beer
tasted
there
i
really
believe
that
hess
could
make
this
signature
beer
as
it
is
very
unique
for
what
san
diego
has
to
offer
pours
a
slightly
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
grain
and
some
slight
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
lively
carbonation
on
a
medium
body
makes
for
crisp
drinking
smooth
and
subtly
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
despite
the
carbonation
very
well
done
take
on
a
simple
classic
style
session
beer
hess
style
fortunately
this
is
nothing
like
any
mexican
beer
ive
had
more
rich
and
malty
than
youre
likely
to
encounter
with
a
burrito
at
first
sip
a
plain
malty
stew
that
needs
a
crisp
touch
grows
in
dimension
as
you
sip
lovely
amber
color
with
a
bigger
head
and
maybe
a
dose
of
shy
hops
this
could
be
the
ideal
american
amber
beer
still
its
quite
drinkable
and
clean
overall
an
interesting
mixture
of
characteristics
that
work
well
together
unlike
any
other
cream
ale
ive
had
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
light
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
smells
of
grains
and
malts
taste
is
similar
to
a
stout
without
any
intense
roasted
flavors
very
creamy
and
refreshing
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
to
be
expected
on
nitro
overall
pretty
good
sessionable
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
this
was
my
first
in
this
style
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
defiantly
enjoyed
it
overall
i
have
been
happy
with
everything
i
have
had
at
hess
grazias
vienna
cream
ale
is
no
exception
bring
home
a
growlerprowler
and
pull
it
out
of
the
fridge
5
mins
before
you
pour
you
will
like
it
o
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
good
lagers
to
me
are
generally
light
simple
refreshing
but
with
light
flavor
in
contrast
to
the
simple
part
this
beer
actually
has
a
lot
more
going
for
it
than
is
typical
but
is
still
smooth
and
refreshing
and
creamy
osolid
beer
overall
although
i
wish
the
initial
flavors
were
more
distinct
because
they
did
not
really
stand
out
to
me
i
cant
say
it
was
anything
more
than
an
average
beer
i
enjoyed
it
though
would
buy
a
growler
to
take
home
this
beer
got
me
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
o
great
beer
to
transition
a
non
craft
drinker
into
the
realm
of
great
beer
it
is
all
that
an
american
lager
should
be
but
usually
isnt
great
beer
for
what
it
is
about
as
good
of
a
cream
ale
as
you
can
get
imo
great
beer
too
bad
its
only
sold
in
georgia
smooth
through
and
through
and
it
has
a
really
nice
balance
of
hops
im
not
the
biggest
hopslover
out
there
so
im
definitely
biased
towards
this
creamy
ale
overall
its
a
pretty
standard
cream
ale
if
a
bit
sweet
and
a
little
heavyhanded
on
the
corn
flavor
still
pretty
drinkable
smooth
taste
only
sold
in
ga
cheers
didnt
really
feel
like
going
into
detail
basically
covered
the
main
points

this
offering
pours
up
a
pale
hazy
gold
with
a
one
finger
white
head
not
much
retention
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
fruity
taste
is
kind
of
apples
up
front
follwed
by
a
dry
yeasty
finish
mouthfeel
is
inoffensive
but
nothing
special
either
this
would
be
a
very
easy
beer
for
someone
who
is
not
used
to
craft
beer
it
is
fairly
weak
with
no
prominent
hop
profile
and
a
mild
taste
that
neither
delights
not
offends
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
wheat
hops
slight
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
cream
and
hint
of
pine
fits
the
style
of
a
cream
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
metallic
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
overall
better
aroma
than
body
or
blend
overall
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
beer
but
good
for
the
style
one
i
would
pick
up
on
occasion
if
it
were
available
near
me
o
creamy
refreshing
brew
light
and
easy
drinking
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
o
this
beer
tastes
similar
to
an
american
blonde
ale
but
has
a
creamier
mouthfeel
it
pours
a
pretty
solid
gold
color
more
golden
than
a
typical
aleslightly
above
average
looking
it
has
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
was
kind
of
weak
maybe
my
olfactory
is
off
the
taste
is
that
of
a
typical
summer
ale
of
decent
quality
but
has
a
kick
of
light
citrus
creamy
highly
drinkable
on
a
summer
day
or
any
time
really
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
a
lot
of
texture
but
if
you
want
a
refreshing
beer
that
isnt
a
crappy
light
beer
this
is
a
decent
pick
o
being
that
most
of
the
cream
ales
ive
had
have
been
trash
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
certainly
better
than
your
average
macro
excellent
ale
it
is
very
refreshing
as
the
bottle
says
it
has
smell
of
grain
and
hops
something
not
really
used
to
smelling
with
a
normal
ale
of
its
style
if
you
know
what
i
mean
anyway
it
has
an
excellent
taste
beautiful
balance
of
malts
and
hops
making
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
grand
finish
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
beach
trip
to
panama
city
being
from
georgia
i
had
to
try
it
the
look
of
this
bite
was
interesting
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
just
like
the
name
the
color
was
golden
with
good
head
the
taste
was
good
and
rich
and
the
feel
was
thick
like
a
beer
should
be
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
on
my
most
recent
trip
to
ga
this
became
my
go
to
after
work
beer
as
i
was
prepping
for
the
next
day
easy
drinking
and
this
would
definitely
go
in
to
my
go
to
poundable
beer
categories
enjoyed
while
at
the
brewery
in
athens
ga
single
finger
frothy
head
on
a
clear
and
golden
body
wheat
and
bread
aroma
mostly
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
refreshing
touch
of
noble
like
hops
greater
than
expected
for
a
cream
ale
very
drinkable
but
more
on
the
pilsner
side
than
cream
ale
side
which
is
fine
with
me
as
cream
ales
are
not
my
favorite
genre
o
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
grilling
but
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
beer
an
average
brew
o
this
one
is
a
step
up
from
bmcs
but
barely
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
6
pack
down
rather
quickly
but
its
overall
flavor
and
characteristics
are
easy
to
forget
i
probably
would
get
again
for
tail
gating
or
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
take
outside
with
you
on
a
hot
day
its
very
refreshing
and
when
serving
that
purpose
its
quite
good
as
a
session
beer
golden
ale
is
quite
nice
but
its
not
something
ill
reach
for
when
im
wanting
to
truly
taste
beer
there
are
just
not
enough
flavors
present
but
id
toss
a
6
pack
into
a
bucket
of
ice
and
take
to
the
lake
without
thinking
twice
d
a
decent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
what
i
prefer
but
when
you
have
to
have
a
brew
that
the
masses
will
enjoy
this
is
your
beer
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
its
a
good
example
it
is
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
i
liked
it
more
the
more
i
drank
it
had
this
with
two
friends
and
we
all
agreed
that
this
beer
was
a
little
odd
it
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
from
terrapin
and
i
was
nervous
to
try
more
for
fear
that
it
may
end
up
being
like
this
for
all
their
beers
the
label
said
golden
ale
so
i
was
expecting
something
like
a
belgian
style
and
when
i
found
out
this
was
a
cream
ale
it
was
clear
as
to
why
it
was
different
than
i
expected
even
after
knowing
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
d
a
nice
session
beer
but
just
not
for
me
d
very
easy
to
drink
nicely
balanced
good
summertime
beer
light
and
refreshing
has
a
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
little
haze
to
it
the
head
is
pretty
abundant
for
a
bottled
beer
and
has
a
clean
white
color
the
smell
is
quite
hoppy
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
also
extremely
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
subtle
hoppy
finish
notes
of
fruit
appear
on
every
level
of
smell
taste
and
finish
drinkability
is
exceptional
d
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
6er
in
a
sitting
it
is
pretty
sessionable
do
i
enjoy
the
flavors
not
so
much
but
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
d
this
is
a
great
session
brew
tasty
unoffensive
and
light
on
the
stomach
light
to
mid
body
beer
good
carbonation
refreshing
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
very
drinkable
with
a
very
approachable
character
carbonation
is
perfect
which
leaves
a
very
refreshing
crispness
behind
the
beer
geeks
will
certainly
say
that
it
is
middle
of
the
road
or
pedestrian
sure
but
we
need
beers
like
this
out
there
because
not
everyone
is
going
to
want
to
drink
a
beer
with
120
ibus
13
abv
and
aged
in
an
oak
barrel
for
six
months
odd
we
know
but
true
light
all
around
d
this
is
a
good
refreshing
beer
thats
helping
beat
this
georgia
summer
heat
right
now
worth
picking
up
to
try
very
drinkable
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
long
hot
summer
day
just
like
today
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
a
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
to
clean
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
fruit
in
the
taste
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
ale
with
small
hints
of
fruit
quite
clean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mildly
tart
with
zippy
carbonation
nice
mild
aromas
of
light
grains
and
fresh
hay
theres
a
bit
of
a
creamed
corn
element
i
dont
love
but
pleasant
enoughoverall
the
flavors
start
out
matching
up
with
the
nose
but
a
nice
toasty
element
creeps
in
and
theres
a
quick
nip
of
citrus
at
the
finish
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
finishes
pretty
cleanly
leaving
behind
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
sweetness
for
the
style
drinkability
really
no
reason
to
not
drink
this
all
day
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
if
youre
working
outside
or
at
a
bbq
and
will
be
outside
all
day
abv
is
very
manageable
and
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
a
decent
introcrossover
beer
for
macro
drinkers
not
enough
here
for
a
ba
lawnmower
beer
d
too
sweet
for
me
though
it
probably
pairs
well
not
a
lot
of
head
not
a
lot
of
lacing
a
very
pleasant
feel
to
the
beer
the
alcohol
doesnt
get
angry
if
lounging
in
your
mouth
for
a
few
seconds
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
exactly
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
not
unpleasant
d
the
bottle
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
about
being
a
drinkable
beer
for
when
you
are
active
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
especially
if
it
would
be
warm
outside
the
flavors
struck
me
of
a
pilsner
and
never
became
overly
complex
all
in
all
quite
drinkable
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
i
enjoyed
it
though
not
my
favorite
offering
by
terrapin
this
is
definitely
a
good
lawnmower
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
one
if
it
was
available
to
me
as
i
enjoyed
terrapins
other
offerings
much
more
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
ben
overall
honestly
this
is
my
least
favorite
offering
from
the
terrapin
brewer
it
is
their
stock
lawnmower
beer
a
beer
that
americans
could
like
but
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
it
comes
to
the
chosen
style
and
the
quality
of
ingredients
is
obvious
thanks
to
keith
for
sharing
i
often
say
beers
have
bready
flavor
but
this
tasted
like
straightup
fresh
sourdough
and
white
bread
it
drank
smooth
with
just
a
light
malt
tang
some
golden
beers
are
blandly
drinkable
but
this
beer
provides
both
lighty
toasted
malt
flavors
in
addition
to
being
highly
sessionable
worth
a
try
in
you
like
golden
ales
and
cream
ales
ya
gotta
throw
a
lighter
session
beer
out
there
if
your
arsenal
includes
the
big
hoppy
monster
rye
squared
and
imperial
stout
this
beer
tastes
good
for
what
its
intended
for
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
which
a
nice
balanced
taste
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
give
a
friend
or
family
member
who
isnt
quite
as
adventurous
a
beer
drinker
the
beer
pours
golden
in
color
with
an
average
head
and
aroma
since
its
not
hopped
to
the
tits
the
mouthfeel
is
where
it
should
be
for
a
golden
ale
effervescent
but
not
too
bubbly
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
a
nice
well
balanced
golden
ale
which
can
be
used
as
a
first
start
for
a
night
of
sampling
other
terrapin
beers
think
of
it
as
a
bobby
weir
opener
stranger
possibly
in
the
first
set
just
priming
the
pumps
for
a
killer
show
youll
know
after
2
or
3
of
these
youll
be
in
for
a
long
long
crazy
crazy
night
after
you
step
it
up
to
the
hoppy
monster
stout
or
rye
squared
good
stuff
from
terrapin
the
golden
ale
comes
across
as
advertised
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
id
say
doubt
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
but
id
take
it
over
a
macro
brew
anytime
knowing
the
quality
of
most
of
terrapins
other
offerings
and
the
comments
on
the
bottle
lol
i
imagine
this
is
exactly
what
they
were
shooting
for
when
they
created
it
pale
yellow
color
medium
head
head
dissipates
quickly
slightly
cloudy
smells
of
sweet
malt
not
much
if
any
hop
aroma
maybe
some
corn
clean
tasting
sweet
some
citrus
very
light
bitterness
at
the
end
crisp
clean
medium
body
high
carbonation
goes
down
easy
a
very
refreshing
beer
pours
a
foggy
yellow
gold
nice
creme
head
this
beer
seems
a
bit
sweet
to
me
not
sweet
like
a
fruit
beer
but
sweet
and
grainy
slightly
quite
malty
caramel
tones
are
there
too
feel
is
a
bit
thicker
on
liquid
might
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
but
it
is
good
enough
for
me
d
not
remarkably
tasteful
but
seems
like
a
great
session
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
yellow
straw
with
a
white
head
a
few
sniffs
of
this
prove
rather
unremarkable
sweet
corn
and
wheat
aroma
with
some
light
hops
also
apparent
flavor
matches
smell
faint
orange
and
lemon
character
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
smooth
full
body
for
a
lighter
beer
with
ample
but
not
excessive
carbonation
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
falls
into
the
upper
end
of
that
standard
golden
ale
category
intended
to
offer
a
conservative
playitsafe
alternative
to
bmc
beer
is
a
straw
hazy
yellow
color
the
smell
is
of
grains
and
barely
with
a
little
sweetness
at
the
back
the
taste
is
sweet
grains
with
a
little
malt
there
is
also
a
some
citrus
hop
flavor
at
the
end
to
make
it
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
good
you
could
drink
a
good
amount
and
drink
it
over
and
over
overall
not
bad
and
quite
drinkable
however
its
not
particularly
memorable
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
of
terrapins
otherwise
spectacular
lineup
3
5
d
somewhat
boring
but
goes
down
well
its
not
a
particularly
good
beer
but
its
not
really
offensive
so
it
would
be
easy
to
throw
back
several
it
has
something
like
a
corn
syrup
taste
that
bothers
me
poured
a
nice
bright
gold
color
with
a
pale
white
head
nose
has
notes
of
sweet
corn
a
subtle
herbal
hop
profile
and
malts
taste
has
a
definite
sweetness
to
it
it
has
a
crispness
hoppiness
to
it
unlike
a
cream
ale
if
you
can
actually
call
it
that
very
drinkable
but
for
the
style
its
a
bomb
but
for
a
great
tasting
brew
its
a
good
one
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
for
a
craft
brewery
to
put
out
it
could
function
both
as
training
wheel
beer
for
people
just
getting
into
beter
beer
or
a
sessional
beer
for
someone
who
enjoys
well
made
beer
overall
its
worth
a
try
or
two
its
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
overall
probably
would
not
bother
with
this
one
again
if
it
came
down
to
a
bmc
product
or
this
obviously
this
would
be
my
choice
there
is
just
enough
in
this
beer
to
put
it
a
step
above
d
enjoyable
to
drink
would
buy
more
i
love
terrapin
and
enjoy
visiting
their
brewery
mild
peppery
light
grainy
citrus
light
and
refreshing
golden
ale
is
perfectly
carbonated
far
from
the
perfect
session
beer
but
pleasant
drinking
nonetheless
so
bottom
line
this
really
aint
as
bad
as
all
that
overall
its
a
pretty
damned
drinkable
beer
ive
had
beers
like
this
before
and
after
one
or
two
they
start
to
become
a
little
stickier
in
the
mouth
than
i
like
but
i
think
there
may
be
just
enough
balance
here
to
keep
it
going
nice
d
great
the
smell
was
quite
the
turn
off
but
the
taste
is
nothing
bad
at
all
and
quite
smooth
and
relaxing
actually
great
beer
i
was
hoping
more
out
of
this
terrapin
brew
ive
had
it
a
ton
of
these
over
the
years
as
terrapin
is
one
of
the
few
constant
craft
brews
always
available
here
in
georgia
but
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
their
beers
but
when
its
95
degrees
outside
this
beer
is
a
thirst
quencher
for
sure
unremarkable
terrapin
makes
some
excellent
beers
but
this
one
didnt
excite
me
decent
beer
nothing
too
amazing
but
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
that
is
probably
what
terrapin
was
going
for
drinkability
probably
terrains
worst
beer
though
at
5
0
and
given
its
price
and
availability
at
many
bars
in
atlantaathens
i
cant
knock
the
drinkability
too
much
its
light
inoffensive
relatively
easygoing
and
actually
sort
of
flavorful
though
the
flavors
really
arent
my
cup
of
tea
beer
worth
trying
and
better
than
many
alternatives
at
many
shitty
dives
in
georgia
so
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
if
youre
ever
in
those
situations
m
d
medium
carbonation
but
about
right
for
the
overall
feel
a
little
prickly
but
not
too
much
of
a
sting
a
light
residual
feeling
leaves
a
note
of
flavour
behind
i
find
myself
leaning
towards
terrapins
more
extreme
or
experimental
stuff
but
this
is
fairly
solid
and
drinkable
clear
uncloudy
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
at
all
a
very
light
refreshing
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
grolschlike
skunkiness
going
on
a
decent
lawnmower
poolside
beer
did
the
job
while
i
was
in
the
sun
by
the
pool
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
here
or
much
to
bring
you
back
to
it
nothing
more
thanks
to
ugadawggug
for
the
opportunity
overall
very
good
sessionable
this
is
a
good
cream
ale
and
the
most
approachable
beer
that
terrapin
makes
for
noncraft
beer
folks
still
its
my
least
favorite
of
their
yearrounds
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
color
with
light
orange
tint
to
it
egg
shell
white
head
with
good
lacing
smells
slightly
hoppy
cascade
with
tinge
of
citrus
mediocre
nose
not
much
going
on
taste
is
on
the
lighter
side
slight
hoppy
bittnerness
maybe
citrus
not
much
going
on
cream
ales
are
not
really
my
favorite
style
thats
for
sure
but
this
is
a
pretty
decent
attempt
at
one
slightly
hopcentric
cream
ale
with
an
odd
bitterness
that
combats
the
german
malt
finish
maybe
a
little
too
carbonate
to
be
super
drinkable
but
a
good
brew
that
for
the
style
isnt
too
bad
pours
a
very
clear
golden
colored
body
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
very
dusty
pilsner
malty
aroma
nuttiness
too
grainy
wheaty
taste
musty
dustiness
some
nuttiness
okay
refreshing
not
my
style
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
a
big
bone
white
head
smells
of
malt
banana
light
fruit
some
yeast
and
some
bread
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
noticeable
hops
and
yeast
not
bad
similar
to
a
tripel
in
some
aspects
very
sessionable
beer
when
i
first
saw
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
from
maryland
much
to
my
surprise
its
a
georgia
brew
bottle
smell
is
kind
of
skunky
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
not
much
head
at
all
taste
is
steady
flat
bitter
hops
with
malty
sweet
middle
and
a
sugary
sweet
finish
a
little
more
hoppy
than
a
typical
cream
ale
but
thats
a
good
thing
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
carbonation
is
on
the
mark
i
would
guess
this
is
a
kind
of
beer
that
would
be
much
better
on
draught
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
wouldnt
pay
a
premium
for
this
over
genny
screamers
crystal
clear
light
gold
colour
with
a
frothy
bright
white
cap
lots
of
lacing
and
fair
head
retention
aromas
of
sweet
malts
cereal
grains
and
a
hint
of
fruity
esters
pretty
mild
though
the
flavour
was
kind
of
nice
more
sweet
malts
and
mild
fruitiness
just
a
bit
of
strawberry
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
was
present
throughout
for
a
cream
ale
its
quite
nice
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
carbonation
average
mild
dryness
no
complaints
here
its
a
very
nice
looking
beer
thats
pretty
refreshing
this
is
easy
as
hell
to
drink
but
i
dont
really
get
a
reason
to
go
back
to
this
beer
even
within
the
terrapin
lineup
md
medium
bodied
and
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
terrapin
makes
such
good
beers
id
be
hard
pressed
to
pick
this
one
up
when
their
other
stuff
is
sitting
next
to
it
on
the
shelf
best
by
3rd
week
of
jan
09
should
be
ok
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
with
zero
head
retention
or
lacing
not
great
smell
mildly
sweet

hmm
its

but
the
feel
doesnt
really
scream
cream

refreshing
but
thats
about
it
d
a
simple
brew
to
be
sure
but
better
than
other
cream
ales
ive
had
i
doubt
ill
get
this
again
but
for
certain
people
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
and
for
others
an
almost
perfect
gateway
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
alot
hmm
its
never
easy
to
review
certain
beers
i
feel
that
this
is
more
of
a
golden
ale
than
a
cream
ale
nevertheless
its
light
easy
to
drink
and
straightforward
that
alone
is
good
enough
to
earn
it
respect
in
my
book
i
can
always
use
a
beer
like
this
and
for
that
im
going
to
give
it
the
due
it
deserves
this
is
a
good
for
style
d
pretty
standard
fare
here
a
decent
light
beer
in
my
opinion
for
a
cream
ale
this
doesnt
stick
apart
from
a
gennessee
appears
a
pale
straw
golden
clear
offering
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
above
the
body
lacing
is
scarce
and
uneven
as
it
dwindles
aromatics
tart
creamed
corned

flavor
has
a
cereal
mix
of
creamy
corn
and
sweet
two
row
pale
malts
a
barely
noticeable
herbal
hop
mix
equates
to
a
mediocre
form
of
the
brew
known
as
terrapin
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
where
as
the
rest
of
their
brews
are
rather
heavy
hitters
id
much
rather
have
this
than
a
bmc
brew
but
that
doesnt
say
much
nice
opening
brew
drinkability
is
nice
a
refreshing
mix
of
malts
hops
and
adjuncts
as
a
cream
ale
this
brew
serves
its
purpose
with
some
hop
burps
between
sips
d
this
is
an
amazing
light
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
terrapin

a
nice
overall
beer
though
somewhat
bland
a
nice
cream
ale
dont
drink
enough
of
these
aroma
was
so
so
light
malt
sugar
and
a
hint
of
lemon
pour
was
a
nice
light
gold
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
left
quickly
and
lots
of
tiny
rising
bubbles
taste
was
crisp
and
refreshing
light
malt
with
some
biscuit
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
aftetaste
medium
carbonation
that
bites
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
bad
very
drinkable
would
make
a
good
summer
picnic
beer
drinkability
a
decent
easily
drinkable
beer
if
ultimately
unremarkable
a
very
good
tasting
cream
ale
thats
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
not
much
of
a
strong
taste
but
feels
great
in
the
mouth
light
refreshing
not
a
sipper
but
would
make
a
nice
summer
beer
the
smell
is
nothing
to
speak
of
the
taste
also
leaves
much
to
be
desired
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
crisp
this
is
an
average
or
so
beer
is
every
category
i
expect
more
out
of
spike
and
mike
as
i
love
most
of
their
other
beers
the
taste
is
very
nice
its
crisp
balacned
and
a
little
citrisy
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
overall
this
is
probably
in
the
bottom
half
of
my
favorite
terrapin
brews
but
its
still
a
solid
offering
worth
a
shot
easily
a
good
session
beer
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
the
start
is
a
little
sweet
and
crisp
the
middle
is
where
you
catch
a
little
lemon
and
then
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
the
bitterness
lingers
a
little
while
on
the
tongue
bottle
labeled
as
golden
ale
golden
colored
not
much
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruits
a
little
grainy
and
wheaty
smooth
sweet
citrus
fruity
flavor
with
some
hops
and
very
refreshing
lightbodied
and
clean
resembles
a
nice
summer
wheat
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
could
be
drinkable
if
you
like
this
sort
of
flavor
but
im
gonna
pass
a
good
beer
for
those
summer
days
very
malty
grainy
beer
if
you
like
cream
ales
you
will
probably
like
this
one
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
pale
and
vienna
malt
scent
its
a
bit
sweet
with
a
light
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
mildly
bitter
taste
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
mostly
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
crisp
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
despite
other
not
so
good
reviews
its
balanced
and
flavorful
an
easy
drinker
md
light
bodied
and
very
carbonated
very
drinkable
beer
lightmedium

and
refreshing
superb

d
extremely
drinkable
perhaps
my
new
golf
course
beer
very
nice
cream
ale
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
light
which
makes
it
a
beer
that
you
could
pound
down
several
of
but
overall
i
found
it
to
just
an
ordinary
beer
ive
been
on
a
lighter
beer
kick
lately
due
to
the
heat
in
ga
not
my
favorite
offering
from
terrapin
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
great
for
the
summertime
cookout
or
after
mowning
the
lawn
d
cream
ale
idk
whatever
not
very
complex
but
i
could
see
this
quenching
my
thirst
on
a
hot
day
d
a
shock
to
see
it
is
a
cream
ale
but
it
is
not
bad
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
good
session
brew
cheers
not
a
whole
lot
to
the
flavor
some
light
grassy
hops
and
pale
malts
with
a
twang
of
yeast
and
medicinal
powder
mouthfeel
delivers
a
crisp
and
clean
body
but
surprisingly
this
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
its
refreshing
promise
golden
ale
finishes
semidry
bubbly
and
thin
all
in
all
this
is
clearly
the
most
unimpressive
brew
of
terrapins
otherwise
stellar
lineup
the
beer
had
a
nice
straw
yellow
slightly
cloudy
appearance
to
it
it
had
a
white
light
head
to
it
that
dissipated
at
the
right
pace
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
light
malt
with
some
citrus
the
taste
was
lacking
for
me
i
got
the
malt
with
some
hints
of
citrus
that
provided
some
sweetness
but
it
really
lacked
a
lot
of
flavor
it
had
some
light
noticeable
carbonation
overall
the
beer
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
at
the
end
i
could
probably
drink
a
worse
on
a
hot
summer
day
so
i
might
reach
for
this
one
again
mainly
to
make
sure
that
the
first
tasting
was
not
just
way
off
d
drinkability
is
goodits
got
a
decent
taste
and
lighter
body
that
lends
itself
to
some
easy
quaffing
more
flavor
is
needed
for
the
drinkability
score
to
increase
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
definitely
a
solid

that
could
be
used
as

a

beer
but
a
little
too
heavy
more
spring
than

but
a
solid
brew
more
crispness
and
refreshment
would
come
from
a
lighter
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
cream
ales
out
there
md
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
bit
of
a
watery
finish
carbonation
is
relatively
light
the
combination
is
just
well
not
exciting
to
me
d
yes
because
there
isnt
any
flavour
d
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
is
pretty
soft

crisp

with
surprisingly
light
carbonation

a
light
somewhat
balancing

decent
for
what
it
is
t
surprisingly
thick
and
creamy
almost
too
much
so
like
the
aroma
this
is
has
a
very
strong
grain
taste
slightly
sour
and
fruity
this
isnt
bad
just
not
very
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
too
heavy
in
the
end
for
this
beer
overall
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
drinks
very
easy
not
the
best
cream
ale
but
i
could
see
sucking
a
few
down
on
a
steamy
summer
evening
in
the
south
d
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
also
not
one
that
i
would
actively
seek
out
as
my
first
cream
ale
sampling
i
am
not
entirely
impressed
with
the
style
drinkable
yes
but
not
something
that
i
want
to
try
again
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
but
what
there
was
smelled
pleasantly
of
malt
taste
was
very
solid
malt
nuts
a
bit
of
spice
all
very
mild
flavors
but
nicely
balanced
plenty
of
carbonation
intriguing
made
me
want
to
take
another
sip
and
before
i
knew
it
the
glass
was
gone
as
this
is
the
first
cream
ale
that
i
have
tried
perhaps
it
is
a
style
that
i
am
simply
not
that
fond
this
beer
is
intended
to
be
a
light
refreshing
warm
weather
brew
so
maybe
i
am
doing
it
a
disservice
by
having
one
in
the
middle
of
winter
all
of
that
being
said
there
just
seems
to
be
something
lacking
in
this
one
the
semisour
taste
is
sort
of
offputting
and
the
carbonation
is
over
the
top
for
me
i
probably
would
not
have
another
overall
not
a
memorable
beer
it
seemed
somewhat
average
or
below
average
to
me
there
are
certainly
worse
beers
but
there
are
definitely
better

very
refreshing
brew
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these

a
great
session
beer
these
would
taste
good
all
night
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
great
to
have
on
a
warm
day
i
drank
this
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
very
hot
central
florida
afternoon
i
poured
the
beer
from
the
bottle
into
a
frosted
mug
and
it
made
about
a
one
inch
head
that
held
pretty
well
excellent
aroma
light
and
crisp
taste
nice
after
taste
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
great
for
a
hot
afternoon
had
this
on
draught
at
the
emerald
coast
brew
fest
in
pensacola
fl
and
then
later
in
bottle
poured
nice
golden
color
with
decent
head
that
disipated
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
though
not
real
strong
taste
has
some
light
citrus
flavors
and
malt
but
is
not
very
strong
decent
warm
weather
beer
but
not
anywhere
near
the
quality
of
their
rye
ale
terrapin
golden
ale
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
mild
malt
and
maybe
just
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
light
bodied
there
is
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
flavor
but
mostly
malt
and
grain
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
decent
just
not
exciting
d
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
session
beer
more
or
less
right
on
for
a
cream
ale
although
i
am
not
sure
if
that
is
a
compliment
terrapin
can
and
usually
does
do
better
a
drinkable
golden
ale
was
intended
and
drinkable
it
is
indeed
d
amazingly
drinkable
yet
again
this
ale
stands
out
amongst
so
many
others
in
a
category
that
feels
like
wellworn
territory
terrapin
shines
the
complexity
and
balance
combined
make
for
a
quality
quaff
the
subtleties
of
this
beer
are
phenomenal
and
the
main
reason
for
being
rated
well
is
the
fact
that
it
asserts
itself
in
a
rather
mellow
category
pours
a
very
light
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
faint
aroma
produces
a
faint
grain
smell
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
more
grainy
malt
with
a
quick
faint
bite
from
the
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
highly
carbonated
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
a
rather
subpar
offering
from
a
very
good
brewery
i
expected
a
little
more
flavor
in
this
one
even
if
the
style
is
not
known
for
being
overly
flavorful
considering
the
high
price
of
this
brew
i
would
stick
with
the
macros
rather
than
this
offering
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
light
beer
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
decent
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
the
beer
shows
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
throughout
the
sample
the
smell
is
light
and
very
grainy
and
slightly
sourlike
a
boil
of
spent
grain
reminds
me
of
anchors
small
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
better
light
but
with
some
solid
flavor
the
spent
grain
taste
is
still
there
but
there
is
also
some
malt
underpinning
the
flavor
and
a
smidgen
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
if
a
not
quite
as
crisp
or
creamy
as
it
could
be
i
remember
this
beer
being
better
a
few
years
ago
but
then
again
i
used
to
drink
it
on
tap
i
generally
really
like
terrapin
beers
this
is
my
least
favorite
this
is
a
great
easy
to
drink
beer
this
is
my
new
favorite
summer
beer
it
doesnt
try
to
cram
flavor
down
your
throat
like
sunset
wheat
or
others
like
that
and
even
though
this
isnt
the
same
style
id
much
rather
have
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
great
brew
the
moderate
body
rolls
up
the
tongue
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
lightly
sweet
and
i
suppose
a
hint
on
the
creamy
side
more
than
the
crisp
side
sweetness
lingers
and
turns
to
a
light
hoppy
finish
this
one
is
not
too
bad
and
easily
drinkable
after
coming
in
after
moving
a
few
rocks
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
tight
bubbles
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma

sour
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
mild
and
a
bit
grainy
the
hop
flavor
is
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
light
id
say
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
could
be
quite
drinkable

but
as
far
as
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
are
ruined
by
the
bland
taste
a
cream
ale
well
as
the
name
implies
this
was
an
excellent
golden
ale
poured
a
clear
golden
pale
yellow
without
a
head
or
significant
lacing
there
was
some
very
nice
visible
carbonation
though
smell
was
light
crisp
and
clean
graing
and
bread
like
with
a
small
floral
aroma
mixed
in
but
very
strong
the
flavors
was
fantastic
for
outdoors
on
a
hot
day
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
one
will
really
cool
you
off
extremly
drinkable
could
put
these
down
all
night
overall
very
nice
light
summer
brew
that
i
could
enjoy
anytime
the
color
is
golden
and
clear
taste
is
nice
with
fruity
undertones
and
hardly
any
bitterness
texture
is
smooth
and
simple
this
is
a
beer
more
for
drinking
with
lunch
or
dinner
or
while
watching
a
sporting
event
or
yapping
at
a
party
than
for
serious
enjoyment
still
it
is
a
decent
brew
terrapin
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
a
cream
ale
never
would
have
thought
this
struck
me
as
a
nottooshabby
golden
as
the
name
implied
flavor
profile
was
very
lively
and
bright
with
a
hint
of
some
citrus
going
on
in
the
background
no
off
or
grainy
notes
with
a
smooth
finish
perhaps
a
bit
to
the
nondescript
side
but
this
would
be
a
pleasure
on
a
hot
day
the
six
i
bought
says
golden
ale
its
definately
not
consistant
with
a
cream
ale
fruity
smell
pineapple
lemon
hue
is
a
hazy
light
goldyellow
like
a
cheap
hefewidmerhummer
this
is
not
too
bad
but
its
not
too
good
either
first
one
goes
down
smooth
but
then
the
aftertaste
really
builds
up
and
its
an
unpleasant
sourness
the
initial
taste
is
good
though
light
airy
sweet
and
sour
with
alot
of
lemon
very
little
if
any
detectable
hops
overall
this
sits
right
where
it
should
between
excellent
craft
and
cheap
macro
as
the
price
dictates
i
paid
7
29
but
the
rhipa
was
better
and
the
same
price
im
not
sure
if
i
can
recommend
this
to
true
beer
drinkers
i
do
however
recommend
the
classic
city
beer
fest
which
is
more
or
less
headed
by
this
brewery
in
athens
overall
worth
a
try
a
good
session
beer
if
the
aftertaste
doesnt
bother
you
edit
i
just
now
read
that
this
is
a
cream
ale
and
that
it
typically
is
much
like
a
light
lager
i
guess
it
matches
style
well
but
im
keeping
my
ratings

golden
ales
having
low
malt
characteristics
need
a
little
more
hop
character
to
take
the
lead
this
beer
has
neither
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
am
not
expecting
anything
too
exciting
terrapin
rye
p
a
is
where
its
at
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
didnt
remind
me
of
a
cream
ale
more
of
an
adjunct
lager
corn
taste
and
nothing
too
special
maybe
good
on
a
hot
sunny
day
not
a
cold
october
evening
oh
well
still
glad
terrapin
is
here
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
drink
before
date
of
6507
pours
a
deep
goldlight
amber
with
a
less
than
1
finger
head
and
poor
lace
nice
sweet
malts
up
front
mixed
with
some
corn
aromas
a
little
bit
if
citrus
aroma
as
well
mixed
with
somwhat
spicy
hop
aroma
this
hass
got
some
really
nice
flavor
for
a
cream
ale
nice
sweet
malts
and
corn
flavors
up
front
with
a
decent
somewhat
citric
and
spicy
hop
flavor
full
bodied
for
an
cream
ale
smooth
and
creamy
and
easy
drinking
as
the
label
says
its
a
perfect
session
beer
and
although
i
dont
think
its
perfect
it
is
a
very
nice
cream
ale
by
no
means
great
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
with
a
slightly
offbeat
taste
if
you
like
cream
beer
and
i
do
its
worth
a
shot
poured
crystal
yellow
almost
no
carbonation
zero
head
or
lace
sweet
corn
malt
nose
with
dominant
grassy
and
grapefruit
hop
notes
rounded
corn
malts
in
the
mouth
a
touch
of
lingering
grass
hard
water
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
almost
no
flavor
in
this
beer
apart
from
adjunct
sweetness
and
the
finish
medium
oily
body
with
prickly
slow
carbonation
eh
why
would
i
want
to
drink
more
of
this
i
wouldnt
turn
this
brew
down
but
i
much
prefer
their
rye
pale
ale
overall
it
is
underwhelming
but
a
decent
session
beer
a
well
balanced
smooth
drinking
beer
that
is
well
suited
to
this
time
of
year
a
malty
but
very
balanced
taste
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
give
the
palate
equilibrium
the
finish
is
amazingly
clean
as
the
aftertaste
just
disappears
this
was
the
first
terrapin
product
ive
tried
but
it
certainly
wont
be
the
last
it
was
extremely
enjoyable
and
i
recommend
it
nice
golden
color
with
a
clear
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
no
lacing
herbal
aroma
flavor
starts
out
with
an
off
homebrew
taste
after
a
few
quaffs
this
clears
out
to
be
a
malty
full
flavor
with
mild
hops
to
balance
fairly
smooth
aftertaste
pleasant
straight
forward
ale
that
is
good
for
summer
quaffing
but
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
until
late
spring
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
descent
white
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
uninteresting
with
some
grainy
malt
notes
slight
cane
sugar
sweetness
and
some
light
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
with
grainy
malt
presence
some
cane
sugar
and
herbal
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
drinkability
is
good
a
drinkable
beer
but
unfortunately
not
an
interesting
one
poured
to
a
golden
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
aroma
was
hard
to
place
although
i
did
get
faint
hints
of
creamy
malt
taste
was
likewise
hard
to
distinguish
some
malt
some
hops
not
much
of
anything
sorry
but
nothing
special
about
this
one
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
drink
again
before
many
macros
but
well
after
many
other
beers
i
have
rated
poured
a
golden
straw
color
aroma
was
totally
lagerish
smelled
like
a
dortmund
nice
head
about
one
finger
thick
then
diminishes
leaving
a
nice
white
film
of
foam
the
taste
was
straight
lager
a
nice
froth
sweetens
the
brew
but
nothing
very
exciting
the
bottle
explains
their
alelager
combo
i
love
that
terrapin
is
a
successful
brewery
in
the
south
and
is
offering
up
great
brews
this
beer
is
perfect
to
cool
off
after
mowing
but
it
is
not
that
spectacular
quaffable
but
not
my
first
choice
cheers
drinkability
i
guess
this
is
designed
to
be
a
crossover
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
brew
that
i
find
compelling
d
not
bad
not
a
lot
going
on
i
knew
that
this
beer
wouldnt
come
close
to
ascending
the
heights
that
my
previous
terrapin
beer
company
beers
have
achieved
tbcs
hop
fetish
dovetails
perfectly
with
my
own
it
only
makes
sense
that
a
brewery
would
need
to
include
a
more
approachable
beer
in
their
lineup
in
order
to
appeal
to
all
comers
id
like
terrapin
cream
ale
to
come
out
of
its
shell
a
little
more
but
given
the
style
its
a
pretty
good
effort
thanks
to
timtheenchanta
for
the
tossin
taste
is
somewhat
strange
to
me
i
must
admit
i
have
never
had
a
cream
ale
before
and
dont
have
much
to
judge
on
it
has
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
not
too
light
or
heavy
just
about
right
the
carbonation
is
good
as
well
the
maltiness
is
definitely
apparent
in
this
beer
with
just
a
marginal
amount
of
hops
if
i
was
to
describe
this
beer
i
would
say
refreshing
which
is
strange
with
a
name
like
cream
ale
overall
its
not
a
terrible
beer
its
just
nothing
great
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
white
head
over
the
clear
light
golden
brew
head
holds
on
nicely
with
plenty
of
slow
fading
lace
aroma
is
pale
malts
with
lightly
fruity
hops
crispness
taste
is
similar
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
as
expected
for
the
style
another
nice
one
from
terrapin
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
nice
solid
dark
straw
color
with
a
half
finger
of
white
head
over
top
a
healthy
cascade
of
bubbles
is
boiling
up
through
the
moslty
clear
liquid
pretty
well
what
i
was
expecting
on
all
fronts
aroma
is
dominated
by
corn
character
with
a
very
mild
and
light
grainyness
its
very
clean
with
just
a
kiss
of
herbal
hop
burried
deep
in
there
its
pretty
one
dimensional
but
as
far
as
i
understand
this
style
is
not
very
aggressive
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
aroma
lots
of
corn
flavor
with
a
small
grainy
note
and
a
light
but
noticable
herbal
hop
that
really
adds
a
nice
dimension
to
this
brew
a
very
mild
and
clean
bitterness
clings
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
with
a
solid
moderate
carbonation
it
is
very
unobtrusive
and
without
anything
to
keep
me
from
finishing
this
bottle
im
enjoying
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
think
the
hopping
is
really
done
well
on
the
brew
less
would
keep
it
from
being
an
impact
on
the
flavor
and
more
would
definately
be
too
strong
i
think
this
one
is
a
winner
its
smooth
and
a
tad
creamy
nothing
thrilling
better
than
anything
youll
find
in
a
gas
station
around
here
though
the
beer
ia
a
light
amber
color
and
there
was
a
small
head
the
smell
is
similar
to
a
light
beer
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
thrown
in
the
taste
is
also
in
the
lighter
beer
style
the
taste
is
of
cheap
grain
but
without
the
general
tastelessness
of
a
mass
produced
beer
it
is
much
smoother
and
mellowed
out
the
mouthfeel
is
overall
pretty
smooth
there
is
a
lasting
light
beer
type
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
certainly
session
this
beer
terrapin
has
done
a
good
job
with
this
brew
this
is
by
far
the
worst
offering
from
an
excellent
brewer
i
dont
think
terrapin
brewed
this
with
the
beer
geek
in
mind
its
more
of
a
crossover
beer
for
the
bmc
drinkers
sampled
on
32306
purchased
in
a
mixed
six
pack
at
southern
market
in
myrtle
beach
contract
brewed
in
frederick
maryland
bright
gold
pour
with
small
wisp
of
a
head
and
slight
on
carbonation
nose
is
soapy
and
grassy
grassiness
carries
through
the
flavor
and
is
masking
the
malty
sweetness
which
is
lurking
crispness
arrives
in
the
body
and
through
out
the
finish
to
save
this
beverage
from
mediocrity
nice
for
style
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
film
and
a
little
lace
the
beer
smells
like
a
macro
with
less
rice
and
corn
and
more
barley
the
beer
tastes
mostly
malty
kind
of
similar
to
an
all
malt
lager
but
less
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
but
a
little
more
watery
than
is
to
be
desired
overall
its
a
good
crossover
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
all
in
all
good
beer
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
likely
to
make
anyones
top
ten
list
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
youre
sitting
down
to
watch
a
game
if
youre
not
quite
in
the
mood
for
a
light
lager
likely
also
a
good
crossover
beer
for
the
folk
used
to
drinking
fizzy
yellow
water
i
must
have
had
a
bad
bottle
of
this
or
perhaps
one
or
more
of
my
senses
were
off
or
not
condusive
to
rating
a
beer
the
first
time
i
rated
this
a
few
nights
ago
i
have
since
had
this
again
i
didnt
alter
my
ratings
of
a
s
t
m
d
too
much
but
it
was
a
little
more
pleasant
experience
the
second
go
round
the
colour
didnt
change
at
all
but
there
was
a
fluffy
white
head
approximately
a
fingers
thickness
which
surprisingly
remained
almost
throughout
consumption
it
had
a
little
different
mouthfeel
to
it
and
most
notably
there
was
much
more
smell
and
taste
present
this
time
more
sweet
malt
both
in
smell
and
taste
this
still
isnt
an
amazing
beer
by
any
stretch
but
i
do
have
kinder
words
for
it
after
trying
it
a
second
time
cheers
pours
an
almost
brilliantly
clear
bright
gold
color
it
is
topped
by
a
quickly
disappearing
pale
white
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
sweet
corn
a
subtle
herbal
hop
profile
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
toasty
malt
in
the
finish
the
taste
has
a
definite
sweet
corn
note
to
it
as
well
the
beer
is
quite
light
on
the
palate
and
the
finish
has
a
nice
level
of
astringent
bitterness
to
it
that
serves
as
an
offset
to
the
sweet
corn
note
there
is
actually
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
to
this
beer
and
it
really
does
help
to
keep
the
sweet
grain
character
in
check
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
sweaty
summer
day
the
first
sip
i
had
of
this
i
thought
it
was
shit
then
i
realized
the
potential
it
has
it
gives
me
a
good
beer
to
drink
after
my
first
couple
micros
on
friday
nights
rather
than
reverting
to
bud
select
or
coors
light
and
wanting
to
vomit
afterwards
pours
a
crystal
clear
honey
gold
with
a
single
lone
carbonation
stream
meandering
to
the
surface
the
head
is
bright
white
and
crackling
consisting
of
loosely
packed
medium
sized
bubbles
that
thins
down
to
a
dusting
of
fine
bubbles
the
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
very
clean
with
minimal
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
and
the
corn
is
prominent
finishes
with
a
gentle
hop
note
but
not
overly
distinctive
light
body
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
not
too
much
carbonation
tastes
a
more
like
an
american
macro
lager
perhaps
if
it
had
been
a
steamy
hot
summer
day
it
would
have
been
easier
to
overlook
the
shortcomings
a
smooth
tasty
beer
that
does
what
it
aspires
to
be
just
a
good
nonchallenging
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
an
excellent
choice
to
nudge
the
macro
drinker
in
your
group
towards
better
beer
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
if
i
was
in
atlanta
and
this
was
the
best
thing
available
next
to
heineken
i
would
pick
this
this
is
the
only
cream
ale
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
was
largely
unimpressed
pour
a
budweiser
charge
4
75
for
it
and
you
have
this
beer
the
smell
was
largely
of
macro
lager
grains
the
appearance
was
a
transparent
straw
yellow
with
a
one
inch
head
the
head
reduced
down
quickly
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
that
laced
very
little
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
good
carbonation
and
very
fizzy
the
taste
was
typical
macro
lager
grain
and
adjunct
i
did
think
that
drinking
three
or
four
at
a
sitting
would
be
easy
enough
but
why
would
you
want
to
this
is
a
very
drinkable
cream
ale
this
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
for
a
summer
evening
on
the
deck
tasted
122805
pass
on
this
offering
good
drinkability
but
wouldnt
drink
too
many
of
them
poor
quality
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
flourish
of
a
white
fizzy
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
appealing
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
adjunct
malt
biscuit
honey
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
palate
is
a
bit
subdued
with
light
malt
accompanying
some
mellow
hops
an
underlying
biscuity
character
provides
a
bit
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
a
very
good
cream
ale
does
what
it
ought
to
and
does
it
well
thanks
to
rajendra82
for
the
bottle
overall
this
is
an
innovative
approach
to
a
cream
ale
very
well
constructed
for
the
style
but
if
you
dont
like
cream
ales
you
might
want
to
pass
on
this
one
somewhat
refreshing
as
a
summer
ale
on
a
hot
day
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
try
this
brewerys
rye
pale
ale
for
a
real
treat
a
good
intro
beer
for
the
macro
drinker
or
a
micro
lover
who
just
wants
a
lighter
beer
the
real
advantage
this
beer
has
over
a
macro
is
that
it
has
flavor
wo
overdoing
it
with
the
corn
or
presenting
any
off
flavors
that
most
people
nearly
freeze
their
macros
to
get
rid
of
tastes
of
sweet
pale
malt
lightly
fruity
and
grassy
corny
finish
of
bitter
hops
bitter
to
balance
the
sweetness
creamy
up
front
with
a
crisp
finish
oh
boy
is
it
drinkable
dont
listen
to
the
naysayers
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
or
any
season
for
that
matter
12
ounce
bottle
label
says

co
in
md
no
freshness
dating
drinks
smooth
and
leaves
my
mouth
with
a
bit
of
a
sticky
feel
to
it
i
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
once
as
the
label
proclaims
like
sunshine
in
a
glass
never
will
i
have
to
revert
to
a
macro
again
ok
when
you
think
of
cream
ales
you
dont
really
think
of
much
and
the
truth
is
they
arent
really
much
terrapin
does
however
take
a
mediocre
or
worse
style
and
do
something
interesting
with
it
spike
is
obviously
a
fan
of
hops
and
this
beer
is
no
different
still
while
a
light
smooth
beer
like
this
could
quickly
become
unbalanced
by
hops
the
beer
only
has
just
enough
to
tease
you
and
still
keep
the
beer
balanced
more
than
i
expected
pours
smooth
with
full
carbonation
crisp
taste
with
the
finish
of
a
cream
ale
overall
good
beer
this
beer
is
very
smooth
some
cream
ales
are
too
sweet
this
one
is
just
right
it
has
a
heavier
taste
than
its
light
golden
color
would
suggest
it
has
no
bitter
qualities
at
all
and
a
fresh
after
taste
good
light
beer
great
dessert
beer
do
love
the
mouthfeel
though
pleasing
bright
finish
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
tart
great
summer
months
drinker
for
those
who
can
get
it
first
tried
this
in
asheville
liked
it
enough
to
buy
a
case
and
bring
it
home
will
be
sad
when
its
gone
and
will
search
for
it
again
my
opinion
is
most
us
breweries
havent
tried
a
hand
at
making
cream
ales
and
thus
many
americans
havent
come
to
enjoy
the
taste
too
bad
catawba
has
done
a
good
job
of
making
a
great
cream
ale
that
and
white
zombie
really
shows
this
brewery
is
going
in
the
right
direction
overall
3
25
well
its
a
cream
ale
about
run
of
the
mill
except
for
some
interesting
mild
phenolic
character
on
the
apalte
and
a
pretty
solid
mouthfeel
fortunately
i
like
cream
ales
its
not
my
favorite
thats
probably
sixpoint
sweet
action
but
its
not
horrible
and
does
have
a
thing
or
two
to
set
apart
from
the
others
ive
often
thought
that
you
could
do
some
interesting
things
with
a
beer
that
is
a
cream
ale
at
heart
but
using
saison
yeast
and
brett
however
thats
not
happening
here
still
in
my
completely
unprofessional
opinion
i
would
say
this
is
just
a
notbad
cream
ale
but
not
a
lot
more
it
is
what
it
is
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
would
pair
well
with
just
about
any
foods
not
as
creamy
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
but
it
is
still
a
good
selection
what
a
lovely
oddball
of
a
beer
brewed
with
wheat
corn
american
hops
and
free
range
yeast
while
none
of
those
ingredients
are
necessarily
new
to
the
cream
ale
style
the
addition
of
wheat
in
this
case
overpowers
whats
typically
a
much
cleaner
style
of
beer
however
while
its
missing
some
expected
largeresque
nuances
it
makes
up
for
this
with
its
uniqueness
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
the
smoothness
and
creaminess
exhibited
by
other
beers
in
the
style
i
am
glad
that
they
justified
the
use
of
corn
which
i
have
come
to
realize
is
el
diablo
when
it
comes
to
adjuncts
in
beer
i
have
had
so
many
silagelike
aals
as
part
of
the
canquest
tm
that
i
can
now
readily
identify
it
when
it
rears
its
ugly
smell
and
taste
again
stop
with
the
editorializing
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
which
is
like
getting
a
bakers
dozen
previous
reviewers
mentioned
the
discernible
lack
of
head
so
i
employed
the
inverted
glug
for
maximum
head
production
it
was
still
to
little
avail
as
i
had
a
brief
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
extremely
low
retention
bye
color
was
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
somewhere
around
escondido
ca
greg
koch
was
scoffing
at
me
nose
was
an
interesting
melange
of
scents
light
silage
i
agree
with
cresant
on
peaches
a
peppery
spiciness
perhaps
from
the
yeast
or
the
wheat
or
both
i
still
like
genny
cream
but
it
never
smelled
as
good
as
this
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
i
did
experience
the
silagelike
flavor
of
the
corn
more
strongly
on
the
tongue
but
i
was
still
getting
a
fruity
spiciness
also
finish
was
semidry
totally
refreshing
and
more
appropriate
for
a
hot
summers
day
btw
what
happened
to
spring
this
year
it
is
downright
chilly
okay
no
more

this

was

corn

and

much

somewhat
sweet
up

on

but
it
balances
out
somewhat
with

and
faint

hops
in
the
finish
not
bad
for
what
it
isits
good
for
doing
stuff
around
the
house
like
today
this
is
a
straightforward
and
simple
beer
but
has
no
flaws
and
is
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
i
wont
go
chasing
it
down
but
would
recommend
on
a
hot
day
and
am
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
thanks
to
the
guys
at
craftcans
com
who
sent
me
the
package
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
crisp
sweet
creamy
some
grains
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
this
is
a
refreshing
light
offering
that
was
perfect
on
this
hot
day
its
worth
checking
out
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
bodied
dense
and
zippy
in
the
mouth
but
a
little
slippery
and
smooth
in
the
finish
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
and
skunk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
slight
skunk
and
earthy
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
very
weak
the
earthy
aspect
i
picked
up
on
was
kind
of
nice
but
in
a
cream
ale
that
shouldnt
be
here
this
one
is
worth
trying
for
a
fan
of
the
style
or
a
ticker
but
once
and
done
is
good
enough
for
me
the
nose
is
fairly
crisp
and
clean
but
theres
a
fair
amount
of
honeyish
sweetness
to
this
beer
mild
notes
of
peach
and
apple
tastes
decent
enough
but
lacking
in
the
attenuation
department
definitely
could
stand
to
lose
some
of
the
residual
sweetness
and
to
gain
some
carbonation
a
little
heavy
and
sweet
on
the
palate
for
what
should
be
a
delicately
constructed
refreshing
style
easy
as
hell
to
drink
and
enjoyable
the
whole
time
dsolid
macrocrossover
brew
enough
flavour
to
hold
my
interest
and
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
the
beer
was
billed
as
a
farmhouse
ale
at
asheville
barleys
seemed
fair
for
the
style
with
a
few
american
twists
opened
with
a
witlike
color
but
with
less
haze
and
more
carbonated
aromas
of
light
malt
grain
blend
and
a
healthy
dose
of
estery
spices
tastes
of
light
malt
take
precedence
over
the
grains
but
contributing
residual
sweetness
that
lingered
a
little
too
long
hops
balance
the
malts
while
contributing
backgraound
spices
and
earthiness
finishes
a
bit
on
the
sweet
tart
side
body
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
low
alcohols
for
flavor
make
it
a
real
thirst
quencer
this
beer
would
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
a
macro
fan
the
beer
looked
like
a
macro
with
a
thin
head
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
light
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
for
the
style
the
drinkability
was
good
this
beer
could
be
sessioned
with
ease
overall
not
really
my
style
but
i
would
take
this
over
a
macro
or
your
average
lager

want
to
taste
nothing
but
vanilla
heres
your
beer
i
was
hoping
for
this
beer
to
have
a
nice
vanilla
taste
but
i
was
sadly
disappointed
theres
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
a
chemical
vanilla
taste
but
its
not
strong
at
all
actually
the
ale
had
more
of
a
bubble
gum
like
flavor
to
me
and
thats
not
something
i
really
seek
out
in
beer
light
golden
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
vanilla
and
creamy
malts
that
give
it
a
strange
skunky
sweet
smell
there
is
a
very
light
hint
of
vanilla
and
some
light
bitterness
but
overall
very
little
flavor
this
is
a
shame
because
i
tend
to
love
vanilla
but
so
far
no
luck
in
a
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
overly
flavorful
and
seems
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
taste
is
right
in
line
with
most
cream
ales
i
have
had
the
malts
are
light
and
grainy
at
best
there
is
something
about
cream
ales
that
give
it
a
unique
taste
apart
from
blonde
ales
they
seem
a
little
sweeter
with
a
fuller
body
the
vanilla
is
pleasant
if
a
little
on
the
light
side
it
a
fairly
well
done
beer
but
being
a
little
better
than
average
in
a
rather
uninspiring
style
category
isnt
going
to
garner
the
highest
rankings
unfortunately
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
and
if
i
was
looking
for
a
tasty
lightish
beer
this
would
do
nicely
for
this
to
be
a
vanilla
ale
it
tastes
just
like
any
cheap
beer
youd
buy
definitely
wouldnt
seek
outbuy
again
only
tasted
because
a
buddy
had
some
if
you
like
cheap
beer
i
guess
this
is
okay
the
name
is
pretty
deceiving
for
what
it
is
not
too
bad
actually
very
light
with
minimal
impact
but
highly
sessionable
and
unoffensive
good
thirstquencher
a
halfdecent
little
cream
ale
charming
in
its
own
little
way
for
those
who
like
their
ales
to
taste
like
sodas
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
vanilla
and
somewhat
creme
soda
like
in
the
taste
a
small
sweetness
and
a
small
vanilla
presence
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
vanilla
cream
soda
like
aftertaste
looks
like
a
pils
tastes
like
a
cream
soda
poured
into
a
lighter
ale
o
not
so
good
another
miss
from
thomas
creek
ive
not
been
impressed
with
anything
ive
tried
from
them
with
one
notable
exception
and
this
isnt
it
dont
buy
this
beer
its
not
good
nothing
about
it
works
i
had
to
chug
it
while
it
was
still
cool
because
i
knew
there
was
no
way
it
would
get
better
with
temperature
anderson
valley
summer
solstice
does
everything
this
beer
is
trying
to
do
but
with
a
million
times
more
aplomb
o
chris
described
this
as
a
dessert
beer
for
pussies
im
not
sure
that
i
entirely
agree
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
for
any
occasion
it
is
tolerable
but
there
are
too
many
other
options
that
are
vastly
superior
o
a
light
beer
with
a
twist
for
warm
days
but
other
than
the
vanilla
not
much
going
on
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
to
pint
glass
a
pretty
unassuming
pour
with
mild
golden
tones
and
a
quickly
disappearing
1
finger
head
smell
was
a
bit
timid
but
did
include
some
nice
vanilla
notes
and
some
root
beer
taste
was
up
front
vanilla
with
some
background
of
biscuit
malt
and
soda
didnt
pick
up
much
on
the
hop
end
feel
was
lightly
carbed
and
a
bit
on
the
weakwatery
side
overall
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
it
had
potential
with
the
vanilla
it
just
got
lost
in
the
shuffle
its
pretty
refreshing
and
sessionable
i
would
consider
it
a
bit
above
average
was
wanting
something
more
distinguished
and
bold
i
would
try
another
if
offered
o
refreshing
but
timid
this
idea
had
promise
i
like
the
underlying
cream
ale
i
would
probably
like
this
a
lot
more
if
the
vanilla
didnt
come
across
as
artificial
ultimately
this
is
a
nice
flavorfulforthestyle
refreshing
lighter
offering
that
will
help
you
through
some
of
the
warmer
days
ahead
o
doesnt
bear
much
resemblance
to
an
ale
to
me
much
closer
to
a
typical
american
adjunct
lager
not
much
here
i
would
want
to
revisit
obetter
than
i
expected
when
i
first
poured
this
one
and
i
may
even
try
it
again
overall
a
misleading
beer
which
is
very
drinkable
but
not
something
that
youd
savor
its
almost
a
funnel
beer
overall
this
beer
is
incomplete
ups
and
downs
but
i
guess
the
flavor
matters
most
and
it
is
decent
for
the
style
overall
impression
not
outright
terrible
but
this
isnt
all
that
impressive
maybe
a
decent
summer
beer
or
something
o
disappointing
and
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
lacked
in
vanilla
or
cream
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
again
the
taste
was
also
a
huge
let
down
vanilla
is
virtually
nonexistent
and
what
is
left
well
does
not
make
for
a
very
good
drinking
experience
no
matter
how
tempted
you
are
this
one
can
be
avoided
had
this
while
vacationing
in
south
carolina
pours
a
nice
light
color
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
taste
was
of
vanilla
mostly
but
subtle
honey
flavor
was
also
present
very
light
malt
character
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
well
rounded
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
the
one
thing
i
would
change
i
prefer
this
flavor
to
be
less
carbonated
the
one
i
had
was
almost
fizzy
other
than
that
its
a
pretty
good
brew
and
something
i
would
buy
again
given
the
chance
o
while
this
beer
does
have
some
flaws
its
still
pretty
enjoyable
o
not
a
bad
beer
the
vanilla
gives
it
a
nice
flavor
profile
even
though
i
am
not
a
huge
cream
soda
fan
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
though
the
cpj
o
while
the
vanilla
is
noticeable
there
really
isnt
anything
else
going
on
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
too
watered
down
which
hurt
this
brew
not
bad
but
nothing
memorable
pours
golden
with
a
relatively
thin
white
head
smells
like
frosted
breakfast
ceral
with
milk
and
a
splash
of
vanilla
tastes
like
diet
vanilla
cream
soda
i
think
the
light
hops
here
emulate
the
bitterness
of
the
artificial
sweetner
as
bad
as
that
sounds
its
not
terrible
extremely
creamy
and
the
vanilla
is
restrained
crackery
malt
makes
this
lighter
and
dryer
than
it
could
easily
be
interesting
enough
and
several
of
my
house
guests
liked
it
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
overall
the
addition
of
vanilla
is
a
nice
touch
i
am
not
sure
that
this
one
would
stand
out
without
the
vanilla
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
nitrogen
a
decent
beer
i
grabbed
this
one
soley
because
it
sounds
delicious
and
sounds
refreshing
i
havent
had
a
really
light
beer
in
forever
so
here
goes
nothing
it
poured
a
very
light
and
extremely
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
frothy
bright
white
head
it
smells
of
a
light
lager
with
the
slightest
hint
of
vanilla
the
lack
of
vanilla
is
actually
surprising
despite
being
an
extremely
light
style
in
the
first
place
as
it
warms
it
starts
to
open
up
a
little
bit
the
vanilla
is
a
little
more
apparent
the
flavor
too
is
disappointing
there
is
maybe
one
drop
of
vanilla
per
bottle
as
it
warms
the
vanilla
is
actually
apparent
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
but
it
is
very
subtle
this
is
a
cream
ale
yes
is
it
average
maybe
maybe
it
drinks
light
but
is
there
really
a
reason
to
go
back
for
another
sip
probably
not
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
i
keep
looking
for
vanilla
and
coming
up
short
skunk
taste
makes
the
drinkability
suffer
for
me
notes
not
a
bad
beer
and
what
you
would
expect
in
a
vanilla
cream
ale
definitely
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
cream
soda
not
a
lot
else
going
for
it
though
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
really
know
when
i
would
want
to
drink
it
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
snow
white
head
vanilla
and
pale
malts
in
the
nose
this
beer
tastes
like
cream
soda
with
noble
hop
bittering
light
bodied
and
fizzy
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
tcb
beers
ive
tried
so
far
and
im
not
sure
what
beer
drinker
would
enjoy
this
brew
forgettable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
even
if
it
is
a
little
farflung
from
the
typical
barleyhopswater
traditional
beers
being
brewed
out
there
its
like
the
cream
soda
version
of
a
beer
while
i
like
it
some
people
definitely
wont
still
its
definitely
worth
a
try
as
it
is
a
neat
little
field
trip
away
from
some
more
typical
beers
the
flavor
does
come
out
better
as
this
warms
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
pours
a
nice
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
a
minimal
amount
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
evident
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
a
slight
hop
hint
and
vanilla
the
flavor
of
this
beer
actually
came
in
three
stages
in
the
same
succession
first
you
would
get
a
very
light
hop
flavor
that
was
followed
by
a
note
of
vanilla
that
was
then
followed
by
a
note
of
cream
upon
swallowing
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
with
multiple
flavors
coming
in
as
the
sip
goes
along
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
from
thomas
creek
and
is
very
smooth
to
drink
and
enjoyable
worth
a
try
for
any
cream
ale
lover
poured
into
a
pint
glass
consumed
with
ronzonie
light
straw
gold
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
lightly
maltysweet
on
the
nose
smells
pilsnery
no
real
vanilla
aroma
to
speak
of
taste
is
light
crisp
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
flavor
midpalate
slightly
dry
and
refreshing
a
good
easy
drinking
ale
for
the
summer
season
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
mainly
of
wilting
lettuce
not
too
promising
it
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
rather
typical
fluffy
white
head
flavor
is
malty
a
bit
wan
not
what
i
expect
from
thomas
creek
i
have
enjoyed
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
that
i
have
tried
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
fizzy
about
average
overall
impression
would
prefer
the
vanilla
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
but
a
tasty
refreshing
brew
medium
light
body
feels
maybe
a
tad
over
carbonated
not
much
to
contemplate
with
this
one
just
an
easy
drinker
im
pretty
pleased
with
this
one
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
beer
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
sweet
goes
down
pretty
easy
decent
beer
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
but
has
a
nice
carbonation
bite
this
is
a
pretty
mild
basic
cream
ale
some
grassy
notes
mixed
with
a
slight
vanilla
sweetness
finishes
sweet
not
bad
pretty
refreshing
really
not
too
bad
but
not
great
i
just
happened
to
pick
it
up
because
i
was
one
short
in
my
sixpack
and
wanted
to
try
something
different
serving
type
bottle
on
tap
at
vintage
301
last
nightpoured
a
very
ight
lemony
yellow
with
a
tight
formed
12
finger
white
that
was
gone
quickly
faint
toasted
aromas
along
with
a
whiff
of
vanilla
but
its
quite
faint
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
and
went
down
smoothflavors
are
pretty
heavy
handed
vanilla
and
some
light
toastiness
almost
like
a
vanilla
wafer
eh
it
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
but
its
not
my
thing
drinkability
an
acceptable
generally
easydrinking
beer
but
for
me
the
gimmick
wears
a
bit
thin
halfway
through
the
bottle
overall
this
is
a
very
vanillae
beer
if
you
like
vanilla
get
this
beer
i
personally
thought
it
was
a
little
boring
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
into
a
sweet
beer
not
too
heavy
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
very
close
to
clear
with
just
a
faint
haze
the
beer
was
a
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
coarse
cap
of
white
bubbles
a
little
bit
of
stickage
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
light
aroma
overall
with
vanilla
front
and
center
some
cereal
grain
and
sugary
caramel
notes
were
in
the
background
taste
was
more
of
the
same
with
mild
bitterness
vanilla
and
sweetness
lingered
light
bodied
crisp
carbonation
decent
texture
a
drinkable
beer
fairly
refreshing
but
the
vanilla
didnt
have
much
to
play
with
even
though
the
vanilla
was
fairly
light
it
completely
dominated
the
flavour
and
aroma
not
bad
though
and
sort
of
interesting
overall
not
a
bad
light
outdoor
on
a
hot
day
type
of
beer
but
to
be
honest
i
have
had
better
still
though
not
a
bad
effort
and
i
would
not
be
terribly
opposed
to
trying
it
again
decent
effort
for
sure
note
a
visit
to
their
website
reveals
that
there
are
kent
goldings
and
fuggles
in
this
okay
id
believe
that
it
also
says
theres
cascade
in
here
as
well
how
much
one
cone
hadnt
had
this
one
in
a
while
but
remembered
its
quite
refreshing
served
a
nice
gold
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
aroma
was
some
sweet
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
a
nice
subtle
blend
of
vanilla
and
malt
the
beer
is
nice
and
light
with
a
refreshing
crisp
bite
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
youre
looking
for
summer
refreshment
hazy
lemon
yellow
appearance
huge
white
fluffy
head
that
hangs
around
a
long
while
a
thin
head
stays
on
the
beer
the
whole
time
with
good
sticky
lacing
decorating
the
glass
gracefully
sweet
grain
smell
theres
not
a
lot
of
vanilla
in
the
smell
like
i
had
suspected
but
still
a
great
smelling
beer
sweet
grain
taste
with
vanilla
coming
through
in
the
end
and
hints
of
lemon
shining
through
at
random
times
such
a
creamy
feel
to
it
with
a
sweet
citrus
palate
this
is
a
great
brew
from
a
brewery
on
the
way
up
finally
i
am
able
to
try
this
brew
while
on
vacation
in
tennessee
i
was
able
to
find
a
store
that
carried
this
as
a
fan
of
vanilla
beers
i
have
been
waiting
a
few
years
to
try
this
and
it
finally
happened
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
clear
straw
forming
a
good
1
inch
head
that
slowly
faded
the
aroma
is
an
interesting
mix
of
vanilla
and
what
smells
like
grain
the
taste
further
brings
out
a
grainy
character
but
also
plenty
of
vanilla
flavoring
along
with
a
balanced
hop
and
malt
presence
not
complex
but
still
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
low
abv
and
decent
flavor
make
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
while
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
flavored
beers
this
is
still
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
continuously
all
night
but
a
great
beer
to
start
the
night
with
or
in
between
the
heavybodied
brews
overall
well
worth
the
wait
imo
i
just
wish
this
was
available
in
texas
definitely
worth
seeking
out
on
future
outofstate
trips
pours
a
cloudy
darker
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
offwhite
head
some
islands
and
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
hoppy
some
hint
of
vanilla
some
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
some
hint
of
vanilla
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
medium
body
drinkable
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
would
be
great
for
the
hot
days
of
summer
overall
a
good
summer
beer
simple
but
easy
to
enjoy
drinkability
i
tried
this
one
at
a
beertasting
a
few
months
back
it
tasted
better
then
than
it
did
now
perhaps
it
was
the
environment
i
dont
think
id
buy
another
6pack
i
dont
think
this
is
something
ill
be
buying
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
original
and
worth
trying
gotta
say
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
drink
not
that
the
quality
was
all
that
great
but
i
appreciate
the
creativity
i
enjoyed
the
light
ale
flavors
with
the
mild
addition
of
vanilla
the
beer
takes
on
a
confectionatelike
sweetness
cotton
candyish
the
source
of
the
sweetness
is
questionable
until
the
vanilla
aromas
enter
the
ofactories
the
a
light
buttery
note
accompanies
the
light
fruity
estery
maltiness
tastes
much
the
same
as
expected
from
the
aromas
a
soft
sweetness
up
front
then
increasing
vanilla
flavors
toward
the
finish
the
beer
weakens
into
the
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
not
hop
diriven
with
the
higher
carbonation
the
beer
gets
very
creamsodalike
a
good
thing
but
it
just
doesnt
mean
its
a
quality
beer
ive
got
to
give
them
cool
points
though
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
the
flavors
were
a
little
too
strong
for
me
personally
the
appearance
and
smell
were
both
good
with
vanilla
dominating
the
nose
the
taste
was
strong
vanilla
bean
that
trumped
everything
else
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
drinkability
was
hampered
by
the
over
the
top
vanilla
flavor
this
beer
when
blended
with
their
doppelbock
was
much
smoother
and
balanced
i
would
recommend
blending
it
as
the
brewers
wife
suggested
when
i
sampled
it
drinkable
but
would
sour
after
a
while
not
one
im
likely
to
order
should
you
try
it
well
i
still
agree
with
my
notes
this
is
the
cream
soda
of
beers
make
of
that
what
you
will
maybe
the
brewery
should
swap
in
some
spicyfunky
belgian
yeast
that
combo
might
actually
work
as
is
i
cant
rightfully
enjoy
this
beer
its
too
sweet
too
onedimensional
too
bad
i
am
surprised
this
beer
is
as
good
as
it
is
yet
i
think
it
could
be
so
much
better
would
a
true
cream
ale
jell
with
vanilla
ill
never
know
thanks
timtheenchanta
for
the
bottle
thomas
creek
vanilla
cream
ale
smells
like
a
dream
each
time
i
raise
the
glass
to
my
lips
i
get
a
blast
of
sweet
vanilla
that
only
makes
the
flavor
that
follows
pale
in
comparison
this
is
still
a
good
little
drinker
but
it
could
be
amazing
if
the
mysteries
of
the
nose
could
be
unlocked
and
applied
to
the
palate
thanks
to
wolfgang
for
an
interesting
beer
drinkability
i
wasnt
expecting
much
when
i
bought
this
thinking
back
to
my
college
days
with
genny
cream
but
i
was
delightfully
surprised
at
the
uniquely
approachable
quality
of
this
brew
tasted
this
at
the
border
beer
bust
and
was
a
bit
surprised
it
was
one
the
beers
in
the
experimental
category
and
it
was
a
bit
like
drinking
a
cream
soda
without
most
of
the
sweetness
i
almost
scored
it
in
second
place
for
the
category
but
the
lightness
of
the
beer
let
it
fall
behind
excellent
flavor
the
vanilla
is
balanced
with
the
light
straw
malt
and
the
low
hopping
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
i
could
see
turning
on
nonbeer
drinkers
pretty
easily
with
this
beer
flaxen
colored
with
quite
a
bit
of
head
smells
sweet
and
bready
taste
is
a
mild
sweetness
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
from
start
to
finish
mouthful
is
light
with
a
very
slight
hoppy
finish
a
very
smooth
beer
and
easily
drinkable
made
me
have
a
gag
reflex
i
am
staying
away
from
this
one
overall
this
beer
serves
a
certain
market
segment
and
i
imagine
it
is
popular
with
those
who
dont
want
much
flavor
or
bite
not
as
good
as
little
king
overall
i
really
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
lighter
beers
that
have
a
good
amount
of
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
on
bitterness
or
sweetness
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
that
sacrifices
neither
hop
nor
grain
flavor
in
its
overall
construction
i
am
very
pleased
that
i
bought
this
and
i
will
be
picking
some
more
up
deep
yellow
in
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
touch
of
haze
poured
with
a
thick
fizzy
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
bready
malt
and
corn
aromas
aggressive
yet
soft
carbonation
uo
front
that
quickly
thinned
to
thin
watery
feel
bready
and
caramel
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
a
tangy
herbal
hop
bite
flavors
turn
bready
and
quickly
fade
to
the
end
finishes
thin
and
watery
with
a
bready

crisp
and

nothing
special
but
a
good
enough

mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
it
tasted
much
better
than
it
smelled
with
notes
of
biscuit
malt
corn
and
unfermented
sugars
i
was
immediately
put
in
mind
of
corn
bread
i
was
transported
to
boas
creek
where
we
used
to
go
fishing
and
take
cans
of
genny
cream
ale
to
cool
in
the
water
it
was
one
of
my
favorite
underage
beers
and
this
was
very
evocative
of
it
finish
was
semisweet
easy
drinking
and
a
definite
summer
cooler
stuffer
o
very
simple
and
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
subtle
creamy
sweetness
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
the
gives
up
pretty
quickly
except
around
the
circumference
of
the
perfect
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
with
initial
notes
of
cut
grass
grain
and
a
light
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
equally
mild
with
mostly
light
bread
and
slight
earthy
quality
it
lives
up
to
its
name
and
has
a
nice
creamy
feel
to
the
body
with
a
mild
bite
on
the
finish
all
in
all
a
good
lighter
flavored
beer
that
you
can
have
more
than
a
couple
of
o
not
really
much
to
write
home
about
first
hp
product
and
not
too
confidence
inducing
but
will
move
ahead
and
try
a
couple
more
this
week
i
am
not
sure
being
that
old
for
a
cream
ale
is
making
a
difference
but
while
enjoyable
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
compared
to
other
creams
ive
had
atmosphere
is
okay
light
really
nice
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
very
subtle
with
a
bit
of
a
soapy
character
bready
with
very
light
hops
and
citrus
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
overall
very
light
and
refreshing
if
your
looking
for
a
thirst
quencher
this
is
your
beer
when
i
first
saw

simplistic
appearance
o
slipstream
will
likely
slip
right
out
of
my
memory
bland
with
some
tannic
astringency
like
an
oversparged
homebrew
not
one
i
will
look
forward
too
i
will
probably
try
to
blend
and
see
if
it
can
be
helped
this
poured
a
nice
amber
colour
with
a
slightly
tan
head
the
nose
was
a
brown
sugar
caramel
maltiness
the
tongue
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
end
fairly
mild
carbonation
so
a
very
easy
drink
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
nice
beer
well
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
from
bottle
included
in
a
mixed
pack
pours
a
surprisingly
rich
dark
amber
with
white
head
that
makes
one
wonder
if
cream
ales
always
have
to
be
a
bit
tepid
looks
tasty
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
not
complex
but
inviting
nonetheless
the
first
sip
reveals
some
perfumy
vanilla
and
grassy
herbal
hop
notes
followed
by
some
sweet
caramel
faint
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
earthy
spice
that
recalls
potato
or
root
cellar
not
fruity
decent
englishstyle
hopping
for
a
cream
ale
pepper
and
gooseberry
coming
to
mind
and
the
mouthfeel
is
bang
on
velvety
smooth
and
melding
nicely
with
the
steadily
accruing
bitter
ashy
yet
almost
minty
finish
to
create
a
really
pleasant
session
experience
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
bubbly
head
with
ok
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
light
cereal
notes
and
dry
grain
is
ok
taste
is
dominated
by
grainy
notes
with
light
cereal
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
a
light
creamy
texture
quite
bland
and
not
even
something
i
would
drink
as
a
session
overall
an
enjoyable
cream
ale
by
phillips
its
one
of
the
better
representations
of
a
cream
ale
ive
sampled
in
a
while
too
many
socalled
cream
ales
canada
im
looking
right
at
you
dudes
fall
short
on
that
most
basic
of
tenets
they
just
dont
have
that
smooth
and
well
creamy
essence
of
bearing
a
characteristic
which
this
offering
obviously
does
not
lack
add
to
it
the
nice
english
bittering
hop
notes
and
we
have
quite
the
eminently
quaffable
bevy
i
wasnt
expecting
chocolate
but
then
again
i
never
know
what
to
expect
anymore
i
doubt
id
buy
a
6er
but
im
sure
the
3
in
my
mixer
will
get
drank
without
issues
d
while
this
cream
ale
had
some
interesting
flavors
to
offer
with
a
slightly
minty
hop
feel
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
just
isnt
my
thing
better
than
other
cream
ales
ive
tried
but
it
just
isnt
a
style
i
enjoy
nice
brew
from
phillips
nonetheless
an
above
average
cream
ale
in
fact
while
cream
ales
arent
a
type
i
try
often
i
must
admit
that
this
is
the
first
cream
ale
ive
had
that
actually
had
a
well
creamy
taste
that
i
enjoyed
its
was
delicious
and
i
would
try
it
again
for
sure
a
nice
smoothe
easy
drinking
taste
a
creamy
finish
i
can
appreciate
this
nice
malty
ale
that
works
as
a
counterpoint
to
the
hoppy
offerings
from
phillips
this
is
a
cream
ale
as
defined
by
bc
brewing
history
aka
the
british
mild
named
cream
ale
by
shaftebury
back
in
paul
and
tims
day
nice
mouthfeel
especially
on
tap
and
very
drinkable
with
food
the
hops
dont
really
come
out
to
play
much
as
it
is
rather
a
malt
forward
beer
phillips
slipstream
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
small
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
some
nice
nutty
toasted
malt
character
and
a
hint
of
damp
earthy
hops
the
dry
toasted
malt
character
leads
the
way
in
the
flavor
with
a
slight
fruitiness
in
the
finish
overall
the
beer
seems
a
bit
thin
but
has
plenty
of
flavor
for
a
cream
ale
if
you
like
cream
ales
this
is
decent
enough
but
compared
to
other
styles
this
is
bland
d
good
drinkability
the
taste
is
nice
and
complex
so
the
beer
doesnt
get
boring
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
their
summer
mixer
pack
for
sure
the
flavours
are
unique
and
provide
for
a
memorable
experience
mild
enough
that
its
easily
sessionable
strong
enough
that
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
cream
ale
smoothness
and
good
flavour
balance
a
good
brew
that
goes
down
easy
enough
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
its
slightly
creamy
in
terms
of
drinkability
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
here
overall
a
really
easy
drinking
simple
cream
ale
that
has
some
nice
flavours
to
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
chocolate
notes
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
no
problem
a
nice
effort
on
a
style
that
isnt
my
favourite
smooth
mouthfeel
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
nice
session
ale
great
for
a
night
at
the
local
on
tap
at
the
saratoga
city
tavern
33115
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
i
get
the
imperial
cream
ale
and
think
the
idea
is
cool
but
im
not
really
getting
the
coffee
other
than
a
bit
of
vegetative
aspect
i
think
the
concept
is
cool
and
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
i
think
its
a
rare
miss
from
carton
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
easy
drinking
way
too
sweet
for
my
liking
yeah
youd
fool
me
tastes
exactly
like
oversweetened
coffee
with
cream
head
even
looks
like
a
latte
its
a
novelty
but
a
good
one
really
doesnt
conform
to
any
category
cream
ale
warm
silky
coffee
stout
not
getting
enough
coffee
astringency
to
be
sure
and
edges
too
sweet
way
to
sweet
for
me
coffee
flavor
was
fun
though
thick
amber
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
cotton
candy
and
something
vegetal
no
coffee
coming
through
as
it
warms
alcohol
starts
to
pop
flavor
is
sweet
vanilla
taffy
wheres
the
coffee
thick
slick
a
little
cloying
cold
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
it
comes
out
as
it
warms
i
expected
a
novelty
beer
but
i
also
expected
coffee
i
got
the
former
and
not
the
latter
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
carton
beer
thus
far
i
prefer
the
pumpkin
scobeyville
cream
ale
which
seems
to
come
from
the
same
general
recipe
by
a
wide
margin
something
was
off
to
me
possibly
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
gotten
to
try
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
cream
and
coffee
the
taste
was
just
like
a
coffee
with
two
sugars
and
cream
i
still
dont
know
how
they
got
that
flavor
with
that
color
of
beer
still
scratching
my
head
over
this
one
overall
strong
like
me
the
way
i
like
it
drinkability
is
hindered
because
of
the
over
the
tops
sweetness
and
fullness
i
give
it
a
bump
up
for
originality
great
bitter
coffee
favor
and
smooth
very
odd
beer
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
since
it
is
just
such
a
strange
brew
overall
i
do
not
get
the
high
rating
however
it
is
not
bad
but
i
think
it
is
just
ok
the
coffee
and
cream
ale
style
do
not
play
well
together
in
my
opinion
the
smell
is
strange
and
has
little
coffee
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
left
nice
lacing
but
it
is
not
a
wellintegrated
beer
i
dont
understand
the
hype
here
it
would
be
a
solid
imperial
version
of
a
cream
ale
but
i
got
absolutely
no
coffee
from
the
aroma
or
the
taste
big
disappointment
considering
all
the
high
ratings
full
disclosure
im
from
nj
but
i
take
my
coffee
black
maybe
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
077xx
on
the
other
hand
the
coffee
flavor
is
so
odd
it
just
tastes
like
carbonated
coffee
almost
like
pop
like
carbonation
i
seriously
cant
figure
this
beer
out
it
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
hue
with
a
thin
band
around
the
shoulders
nose
expresses
light
toasted
malts
with
some
vegetal
coffee
notes
taste
is
a
bit
strange
coffee
but
lacking
the
full
body
and
malt
profile
usually
associated
with
coffee
beers
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
an
assertive
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
thing
just
not
really
feeling
the
imperial
cream
ale
thing
overtly
sweet
malty
and
hard
to
drink
it
lacks
carbonation
heavy
on
the
stomach
all
cream
and
no
coffee
its
like
a
malt
liquor
on
steroids
no
thanks
o
an
unusual
beer
and
hard
to
score
not
much
of
a
tostyle
cream
ale
too
strong
and
obviously
featuring
a
distinct
flavor
additive
but
the
cornbased
sweetness
and
alcohol
notes
bring
immediately
to
mind
genny
cream
ale
in
the
end
the
flavors
ultimately
dont
quite
gel
with
the
unique
sweetcoffee
profile
giving
way
to
cheap
corny
alcohol
notes
lower
abv
might
serve
this
brew
well
o
a
nice
novelty
beverage
but
not
something
that
would
ever
be
sessionable
shared
this
with
the
wife
and
both
agreed
a
full
pour
would
be
tough
to
finish
based
on
sweetness
too
sweet
for
my
liking
really
fun
beer
worth
grabbing
a
few
im
wondering
what
time
will
do
to
it
sometimes
a
beer
tries
to
do
a
lot
and
sometimes
a
beer
tries
to
focus
on
something
and
do
it
well
this
beer
focuses
on
doing
one
thing
well
on
paper
it
all
lends
toward
a
complex
experience
big
12
imperial
cream
ale
with
two
kinds
of
coffee
thrown
in
to
the
mix
the
look
is
golden
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
fades
and
leaves
small
spots
of
lacing
the
nose
nails
what
it
sets
out
for
its
regular
coffee
and
this
would
fool
me
for
the
real
thing
if
like
a
bit
more
punch
aromas
are
muted
but
whats
there
is
great
creamy
sweetness
up
front
gives
way
to
bittering
coffee
notes
and
a
blended
coffee
with
milk
and
two
sugar
taste
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
absolutely
nails
what
it
sets
out
to
do
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
some
slightly
dry
feel
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
fantastic
in
its
simplicity
the
color
flavors
and
aromas
all
work
to
achieve
that
experience
of
a
beer
that
represents
a
regular
coffee
overall
one
of
a
kind
and
just
awesome
the
roasty
coffee
really
balances
out
the
sweetness
its
definitely
not
cloying
and
i
like
sweet
beers
so
this
just
works
color
deceptive
sweet
milk
scent
dunkin
on
beer
super
creamy
and
sweet
coffee
hides
abv
well
leaves
me
wanting
more
coffee
great
nonetheless
this
beer
fits
the
bill
100
to
a
t
as
described
by
the
brewer
im
strictly
a
black
coffee
kinda
guy
but
this
was
still
very
enjoyable
from
the
nose
through
the
finish
well
done
and
a
must
for
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
coffee
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
foamy
white
head
that
fizzled
down
to
a
tiny
ring
minimal
lacing
in
the
nose
caramel
cremes
and
distant
coffee
booze
the
taste
was
really
pretty
bad
sickeningly
sweet
caramel
and
sour
cream
cake
batter
fusel
alcohol
sweet
corn
some
roast
but
any
coffee
in
this
was
really
an
afterthought
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
syrupy
with
a
body
like
a
halfflat
soda
the
high
abv
was
definitely
theremaybe
not
all
12
but
it
was
definitely
boozy
overall
this
was
a
revolting
mess
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
never
again
this
is
beer
nirvana
great
beer
real
smooth
creme
is
great
find
it
overall
comimg
into
this
brew
i
heard
good
things
and
had
high
hopes
overall
feelings
reveal
a
great
brew
delicious
coffee
beer
roasted
malts
sweet
flavors
everything
is
great
in
balance
would
totally
have
again
but
my
luck
and
timing
i
may
be
st
out
of
luck
i
will
be
searching
for
this
beer
again
i
will
recommend
to
everyone
and
again
will
search
for
more
of
this
delicious
brew
cheers
soda
this
is
a
very
good
coffee
brew
but
clocks
in
just
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
always
impresses
like
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
morning
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
so
tasty
rich
and
excellent
really
unique
beer
and
hides
its
12
exceptionally
well
not
usually
a
fan
of
carton
stuff
which
to
my
palate
can
be
overhopped
and
unbalanced
but
this
is
a
home
run
only
thing
i
disliked
was
that
the
finish
was
quite
sweet
it
definitely
evoked
the
last
sip
of
a
regular
coffee
but
i
thought
it
may
have
been
just
a
bit
too
much
overall
excellent
lives
up
to
the
name
except
its
a
good
cup
of
coffee
not
a
crappy
cup
of
coffee
im
loving
what
carton
is
doing
just
as
described
regular
coffee
in
a
beer
form
with
a
12
kick
o
really
good
beer
nailed
the
style
not
the
most
earthshattering
beer
ive
had
but
i
respect
the
buzz
and
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
it
is
a
big
brew
in
two
ways
a
hearty
12
abv
beer
and
a
strong
coffee
that
holds
up
to
the
milk
and
sugar
beware
of
the
sneaky
alcohol
content
as
a
coffee
beer
this
is
just
average
however
as
a
cream
ale
this
is
unbelievable
it
depends
on
how
you
categorize
it
but
as
its
listed
its
hard
to
say
this
beer
isnt
top
notch
really
just
average
all
around
i
completely
dont
understand
the
hype
on
this
one
but
more
power
to
carton
for
getting
another
beer
on
the
map
love
boat
beer
dearly
o
a
very
unique
beer
that
everyone
should
try
cup
of
coffee
in
a
can
and
its
delicious
this
beer
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
a
coffee
ale
should
be
i
dont
prefer
sugar
in
my
coffee
so
its
a
little
sweet
but
it
works
at
12abv
this
beer
isnt
boozy
at
all
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
has
the
chance
i
picked
up
a
growler
tonight
and
am
extremely
happy
about
it
very
unique
and
the
abv
is
more
hidden
than
almost
any
beer
i
have
ever
drank
great
mouth
feel
and
it
absolutely
tastes
like
a
heavy
cream
and
sugared
coffee
with
a
beautiful
honeyed
color
and
frothy
white
head
regular
coffee
is
certainly
very
inviting
its
got
a
sweet
and
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
citrus
a
hint
of
coffee
and
perhaps
even
some
light
hops
the
taste
is
very
bready
and
its
certainly
identifiable
as
a
cream
ale
however
the
genuine
coffee
flavor
definitely
comes
through
enough
to
make
it
very
unique
whats
crazy
is
that
its
so
soft
on
the
palate
and
the
large
abv
is
essentially
undetectable
very
dangerous
to
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
realize
the
magnitude
of
what
one
has
just
drank
but
truly
a
marvel
has
been
crafted
here
i
am
proud
that
this
was
made
in
my
home
state
a
must
try
if
you
can
obtain
it
an
extremely
unique
beer
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
buying
from
the
brewery
this
past
weekend
the
beer
has
an
orange
tint
to
it
that
doesnt
match
up
with
the
earthy
roasted
nose
that
is
accompanied
by
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthful
is
fantastic
and
has
more
carbonation
than
one
would
think
from
looking
at
the
beer
initially
it
envelopes
your
mouth
with
a
wonderful
sweetness
that
i
have
no
beer
to
compare
it
to
and
a
slight
roasty
bitterness
that
is
enjoyable
and
doesnt
linger
you
would
not
believe
this
is
12
if
you
were
not
informed
of
it
this
is
simply
a
great
beer
that
people
of
any
style
preference
would
be
inclined
to
enjoy
not
a
big
coffee
guy
so
take
that
into
rating
tmo
12
really
so
easy
drinking
im
shocked
the
brew
is
really
nice
it
takes
a
well
made
cream
ale
a
style
which
when
made
well
is
actually
rather
tasty
to
me
and
then
slams
it
with
a
soft
spice
forward
coffee
very
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
im
not
sure
i
understand
all
the
hype
surrounding
these
little
releases
but
i
did
enjoy
the
beer
very
much
syrupy
sweet
with
a
little
coffee
finish
o
another
great
original
beer
experience
a
must
try
can
become
a
classic
if
someone
just
handed
you
a
glass
of
this
you
would
think
it
was
a
dipa
based
on
color
and
head
though
there
is
minimal
if
any
lacing
but
one
whiff
and
that
classic
coffee
smell
takes
over
filling
the
nose
accompanied
by
a
slight
hint
of
sweetener
and
maybe
some
caramel
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
as
sweet
as
it
is
though
though
maybe
i
just
enjoy
my
regular
coffee
a
bit
more
on
the
roasted
side
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
stopping
just
short
of
cloying
but
the
carb
levels
are
perfect
cant
believe
this
is
12
abv
though
drinks
much
lower
than
that
unsurprisingly
short
finish
really
good
beer
would
love
to
try
on
tap
i
was
utterly
shocked
at
the
commanding
presence
of
coffee
in
this
beer
and
yet
it
was
not
roasty
at
all
like
you
get
from
founders
breakfast
stout
ballast
point
victory
at
sea
or
evolution
rise
up
instead
you
get
exactly
what
the
label
says
a
cream
ale
with
coffee
it
certainly
fooled
me
for
being
12
abv
if
you
asked
me
to
guess
i
would
probably
say
half
that
buy
as
much
of
this
as
you
can
despite
the
15
price
tag
for
a
4pack
your
taste
buds
will
thank
you
feel
is
rich
this
beer
is
flat
out
great
wish
carton
made
more
if
it
o
there
is
nothing
else
to
say
besides
commend
carton
on
this
beer
an
amazing
beer
that
litterally
tasted
like
a
regular
jersey
coffee
i
was
super
happy
i
got
this
and
very
pleased
with
the
outcome
of
this
beer
from
carton
good
lacing
all
the
way
down
pale
copper
hue
with
a
perfect
clarity
smells
of
fresh
cold
brewed
coffee
with
an
edge
of
toasted
malt
and
alcohol
mild
coffee
flavor
throughout
some
malt
sweetness
with
in
the
creamy
fullish
body
very
warming
alcohol
sweetness
lingers
and
so
does
the
coffee
flavor
in
the
end
this
does
taste
like
a
regular
coffee
with
a
kick
of
course
color
threw
me
off
a
bit
as
its
lighter
than
i
expected
i
like
it
when
a
brewery
can
surprise
me
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
12
you
bet
gingery
coffee
and
milk
flavor
plus
a
creamy
body
make
this
one
a
winner
in
my
book
odone
of
the
more
interesting
beers
from
the
ebf
a
perfect
beer
to
sample
i
dont
know
how
well
i
would
do
with
a
lot
more
of
it
it
sure
is
interesting
o
they
did
jersey
proud
with
this
beer
everyone
up
here
knows
what
a
regular
coffee
is
this
one
nails
that
description
coffee
with
creammilk
and
two
sugars
i
wish
my
coffee
each
morning
was
this
nice
my
fiance
was
skeptical
that
we
went
out
of
our
way
for
this
but
ordered
her
own
after
trying
mine
it
really
is
as
its
described
overall
this
tasted
like
a
smooth
iced
coffee
from
a
national
chain
except
its
a
beer
a
nj
cup
of
coffee
with
tons
of
sugar
and
cream
in
beer
form
wheres
my
pork
roll
and
cheese
an
interesting
coffee
brew
that
does
not
have
the
roasted
malt
and
dark
flavors
associated
with
chocolate
beers
it
tastes
more
like
a
coffee
syrup
drink

edit
and
now
its
in
cans
absolutely
incredible
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
felt
middle
of
the
road
ratings
were
the
only
appropriate
thing
to
give
this
as
i
feel
it
probably
is
doing
what
it
set
out
to
do
but
that
thing
is
so
odd
id
rather
no
longer
talk
about
this
beverage
this
beer
is
simply
not
my
taste
cream
ales
are
best
kept
light
and
crisp
this
beer
doesnt
have
enough
backbone
to
handle
the
booziness
one
of
the
worst
craft
beers
ive
had
recently
but
i
tend
not
to
like
imperial
pale
lagers
and
this
beer
is
a
close
cousin
to
those
styles
the
taste
comes
across
as
if
there
was
actual
cream
added
very
smooth
and
rich
decent
carbonation
even
if
the
richness
makes
it
seem
otherwise
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
o
a
cool
idea
but
im
not
sure
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
one
full
pint
of
those
as
enough
for
me
credit
for
going
for
it
in
a
style
rarely
seen
around
these
parts
but
the
flavor
is
not
my
bag
of
chips
o
a
decent
brew
points
for
creativity
not
your
normal
runofthemill
brew
cream
ales
an
alelager
hybrid
of
sorts
are
greatly
underrepresented
and
often
misunderstood
slumbrew
reminds
us
how
fun
the
style
can
be
with
their
dangerously
delicious
imperalized
interpretation
a
cold
lager
blended
with
a
warm
ale
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
the
complexity
and
sheer
drinkability
quickly
forgives
and
forgets
the
look
and
smell
are
pretty
good
seethrough
orangeish
body
with
twofinger
head
that
dies
quick
with
lace
patches
on
glass
and
a
mix
of
some
bitter
grainy
hops
and
malts
along
with
a
sugary
caramel
edge
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
just
didnt
come
through
as
well
for
me
thoughwho
knows
bad
tap
line
old
keg
there
is
a
creaminess
and
smoothness
to
the
beer
goes
down
easy
but
not
watery
mind
you
and
there
is
some
sweet
caramel
malt
but
its
either
not
enough
or
there
are
just
too
much
hops
because
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
grainy
sharp
and
a
little
bitter
with
a
very
dry
finish
maybe
the
abv
bled
in
a
little
or
my
beer
had
a
touch
of
metallic
taste
but
overall
id
say
the
sweetness
was
overpowered
for
a
good
but
not
great
beer
calling
this
beer
a
cream
ale
or
even
an
imperial
cream
ale
is
a
bit
misleading
as
it
bares
absolutely
no
resemblance
to
other
versions
of
the
style
that
i
have
sampled
regardless
my
better
half
really
impressed
me
if
you
appreciate
unique
beers
that
push
boundaries
then
definitely
give
this
a
shot
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
shade
of
copper
with
a
thick
white
head
there
are
visible
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
beer
some
lacing
is
left
behind
as
the
head
recedes
the
beer
smells
of
grain
caramel
and
grassy
and
woody
hop
notes
the
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
i
get
the
caramel
and
honey
flavors
up
front
the
grain
and
grassy
and
woody
hops
are
also
there
the
back
end
bitterness
is
there
and
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
slick
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
easily
this
is
a
very
good
beer

in

near

a
battle
more
than
balance
here
hops
and
malt
dont
seem
to
fully
mesh
together
for
me
and
while
it
is
not
a
chore
to
drink
it
certainly
is
not
a
bomber
id
get
on
my
own
ive
had
batches
that
were
sweeter
and
a
bit
more
palatable
o
its
not
bad
quite
simple
and
definitely
seems
to
defy
the
style
being
an
imperial
cream
ale
it
makes
sense
doesnt
taste
like
any
other
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
its
definitely
got
much
stronger
malt
and
hops
than
any
cream
ale
ive
tried
which
is
good
and
bad
i
suppose
stronger
sharper
flavors
but
loses
the
lightness
smoothness
and
the
plain
drinkable
simplicity
of
a
cream
ale
i
had
a
hard
time
scoring
this
one
and
waffled
quite
a
bit
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
fresh
clean
malt
profile
with
a
big
alcohol
heat
and
hop
bite
punch
in
the
finish
this
is
a
syrupy
sweet
yet
easy
to
drink
cream
ale
that
i
would
recommend
to
any
malt
head
o
very
different
not
bad
but
not
something
id
want
often
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
cream
ale
just
a
ton
of
vanill
and
cream
and
super
smooth
and
cream
and
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
it
again
the
beer
is
bright
orange
and
mostly
clear
sporting
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
on
the
tulip
the
aroma
brings
floral
notes
malt
cream
wow
the
cream
character
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
vanilla
and
cream
soda
notes
soft
and
smooth
on
the
palate
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
great
beer
for
people
you
know
who
arent
into
bitter
super
hoppy
beers
this
a
nice
gateway
beer
i
want
more
sadly
its
a
limited
release
and
probably
wont
be
around
for
a
while
so
get
it
while
you
can
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
special
not
creamy
as
i
expected
tastes
like
its
boozier
than
it
is
although
nice
malts
and
fairly
drinkable
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
a
lot
of
vanilla
and
some
grain
malts
taste
is
sweet
vanilla
upfront
that
faded
to
a
bit
of
grain
and
then
back
to
vanilla
nice
creamy
body
goes
down
well
pretty
solid
cream
ale
full
of
vanill
flavors
that
work
really
well
taste
starts
sweet
citrus
in
the
middle
with
a
strong
bitterness
through
the
close
alcohol
bite
lingers
after
the
swallow
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
just
about
what
i
would
expect
an
imperial
cream
ale
to
be
like
very
good
dont
see
too
many
examples
of
this
style
around
here
especially
an
imperialized
cream
ale
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
reminds
me
of
an
orange
creamcicle
nicely
balanced
with
no
dominating
flavor
overall
a
cool
concept
and
really
enjoyable
beer
i
kept
wanting
more
shared
the
22
o
its
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
of
theres
but
definitely
worthy
em
comin
sorry
but
this
is
just
not
a
good
beer
the
taste
doesnt
match
the
style
at
all
its
a
sweet
mess
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
copper
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
caramel
vanilla
malts
some
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
good
beer
on
this
hot
day
like
drinking
a
smoother
very
slightly
sweeter
wexler
on
tap
at
bar
louie
in
west
palm
beach
dark
amberred
color
with
no
head
i
assume
it
was
poured
poorly
smells
of
sweet
caramel
candy
it
tastes
like
a
dessert
unfortunately
i
had
this
after
an
ipa
so
i
fear
my
palette
may
have
been
wrecked
to
taste
this
well
i
tasted
a
strong
caramel
taste
with
a
malty
bread
note
midway
after
taste
is
pleasant
and
sweet
this
is
a
great
if
you
want
a
light
sweet
beer
pours
tan
with
frothy
head
minimal
lacing
smells
of
caramel
sugar
too
sweet
gentle
mouthfeel
is
you
can
tolerate
real
sweetness
not
terrible
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
it
almost
tasted
bitter
like
it
had
a
much
higher
abv
than
it
really
did
i
love
cream
soda
and
was
really
excited
to
try
this
but
i
like
the
idea
i
was
sold
on
the
idea
in
fact
but
the
beer
i
think
under
delivers
a
little
bit
this
time
it
doesnt
seem
a
whole
lot
like
a
cream
ale
as
a
base
beer
almost
amber
in
color
dark
to
say
the
least
for
the
style
almost
more
like
a
cream
soda
than
a
cream
ale
there
the
caramel
is
there
all
form
the
grain
i
think
but
its
sweet
and
rich
enough
the
nose
and
taste
mirror
each
other
rich
but
bubbly
and
there
is
an
obvious
vanilla
profile
to
it
i
think
it
may
even
be
brewed
with
vanilla
plenty
of
bubbles
but
the
sweetness
lingers
a
little
too
long
i
think
and
even
half
a
can
with
my
brother
drinking
the
other
half
was
enough
for
both
of
us
the
idea
rocks
but
this
needs
to
ferment
down
a
little
longer
if
they
let
it
climb
up
to
around
6
abv
i
think
it
would
be
a
radically
better
and
more
drinkable
brew
as
it
stands
its
a
novelty
and
little
else
that
might
be
harsh
it
probably
accomplished
its
stated
objective
but
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
just
the
same
i
had
this
beer
before
and
under
the
meal
20
oz
longhorn
porterhouse
and
i
must
say
i
liked
it
creamy
soft
and
a
little
sweetness
great
taste
for
a
beer
with
only
5
abv
tried
this
on
vacation
in
orlando
looks
good
tastes
ok
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
pretty
beer
that
smells
like
a
sweet
brown
ale
it
is
not
as
sweet
to
taste
as
it
smells
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
but
the
caramel
and
vanilla
are
prominent
slight
cloying
aftertaste
keeps
it
from
being
perfect
very
enjoyable
drinkable
in
all
seasons
o
very
tasty
beer
easy
drinking
makes
awesome
banana
nut
bread
my
rating
3
25
o
decent
dessert
beer
but
may
not
satisfy
for
long
as
a
session
ale
due
south
is
a
local
place
that
brews
a
good
selection
the
caramel
cream
ale
and
their
ipas
are
their
gotos
and
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
i
went
with
the
caramel
cream
it
was
excellent
great
balance
of
vanilla
and
caramel
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hopsminimal
for
this
beer
mixed
with
their
honey
wheat
it
was
even
better
my
only
criticism
if
you
can
really
call
it
that
is
that
it
does
not
seem
to
stay
carbonated
well
in
a
growler
recently
due
south
released
one
of
their
ipas
in
cans
and
i
am
hoping
the
caramel
cream
follows
suit
until
then
if
you
are
in
the
boynton
beach
area
this
place
is
definetly
worth
the
trip
poured
into
a
due
south
brewing
co
pint
glass
produced
small
head
for
this
dark
amber
beer
smell
was
vanilla
and
caramel
taste
was
vanilla
caramel
and
malt
reminded
me
of
a
good
amber
or
cream
ale
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
not
much
hop
flavor
mf
was
medium
with
low
carbonation
very
tasty
on
its
own
or
with
the
ribs
that
i
was
enjoying
had
another
as
its
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
lately
i
may
stop
by
the
brewery
as
its
close
to
where
i
live
ill
definitely
look
for
this
again
as
it
was
smooth
and
tasty
today
85
i
purchased
a
six
at
total
wine
they
just
got
it
in
stock
needless
to
say
i
can
hardly
wait
for
it
to
get
cold
carbonation
is
softmedium
body
is
medium
emphasizing
the
sweetness
i
cant
wait
to
get
out
to
the
brewery
and
try
it
from
the
source
o
another
solid
offering
from
due
south
when
i
asked
mike
at
the
tasting
bar
which
beer
best
represents
their
brewery
he
filled
my
growler
with
this
very
easy
drinking
yet
its
packing
plenty
of
flavor
for
a
low
abv
session
beer
a
must
try
for
cream
ale
addicts
like
myself
on
draft
at
due
south
for
their
grand
opening
had
heard
about
this
beer
from
prior
events
so
i
was
jazzed
to
try
this
one
slight
caramel
cream
notes
with
a
tad
bit
of
funk
heard
this
batch
may
have
been
sub
par
so
ill
give
due
south
a
break
here
will
definitely
try
again
though
was
not
crazy
about
this
beer
its
very
malty
not
my
thing
pours
a
golden
hue
with
little
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
basic
but
there
were
some
notes
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
taste
was
good
with
a
bright
beginning
and
a
semisweet
finish
not
very
complex
but
makes
for
a
nice
simple
drinking
beer
can
from
mrbarleywine
thanks
for
the
opportunity
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
light
amount
of
floaties
smallish
bubbly
white
head
slowly
dissipates
aroma
is
sweet
sugary
maltiness
mostly
with
light
sweet
orange
fruitiness
and
little
to
no

the
flavor
is
sugary
sweet
maltiness
with
hints
of
fruit
and
little
to
no
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
the
only
thing
cutting
through
the
massive
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
the
carbonic
acid
form
the
carbonation
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
something
to
drink
when
mowing
the
lawn
am
i
the
only
one
who
gets
a
lot
of
honey
notes
from
this
was
quite
enjoyable
quaffing
this
in
my
recliner
after
mowing
the
lawn
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
offered
to
me
again
hell
i
might
try
to
seek
out
a
6er
or
two
if
my
local
store
can
get
it
a
nice
solid
offering
from
grey
sail
looking
forward
to
checking
out
more
from
them
cheers
o
after
a
few
drinks
the
mineral
aftertaste
was
all
i
tasted
not
a
fan
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
its
extremely
quaffable
with
its
sweetness
level
and
agreeable
taste
a
person
could
knock
these
back
with
abandon
that
said
it
isnt
necessarily
an
amazing
beer
and
i
would
probably
like
it
better
if
it
was
a
little
more
balanced
in
taste
but
there
is
still
enough
positive
going
on
here
to
recommend
it
just
be
careful
when
you
pour
my
cans
all
overflowed
the
moment
i
popped
the
top
and
yours
may
do
the
same
overall
impression
a
refreshing
light
cream
ale
the
feel
of
this
beer
was
pretty
light
and
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
there
is
a
good
drinkable
feel
that
goes
down
easy
tastes
like
a
cross
between
an
amber
and
a
macrobrew
its
a
bit
watery
and
seemingly
thin
in
taste
but
theres
a
bit
of
cream
in
the
swallow
the
high
carbonation
makes
it
seem
lighter
than
it
really
is
short
aftertaste
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
nor
is
it
very
exciting
odi
genuinely
like
cream
ales
this
one
isnt
anything
spectacular
but
i
would
bring
this
to
a
get
together
know
my
friends
would
enjoy
it
and
so
would
i
very
sessionable
and
better
than
advertised
on
the
site
really
not
bad
for
a
cream
ale
and
fits
the
style
pretty
well
no
off
flavors
or
anything
that
turns
me
off
just
not
a
thing
i
would
personally
buy
a
lot
of
but
i
could
see
how
some
would
enjoy
this
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
a
little
thin
malts
are
nice
hops
are
soso
not
very
creamy
light
carbonation
somehow
refreshing
but
just
a
decent
tasting
beer
overall
decent
but
not
noteworthy
id
get
a
gansett
cream
ale
before
this
more
bang
and
less
buck
for
those
anyway
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
nothing
stands
out
as
particularly
excellent
but
there
is
nothing
glaringly
wrong
either
i
think
its
neutral
flavor
and
light
body
would
make
it
a
suitable
beer
to
pair
with
any
meal
where
you
want
the
taste

on
dinner

from

in

and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
went
with
my
soontobepatented
crack
inverted
glug
which
produced
two
shortlived
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
i
will
say
that
it
did
leave
some
beautiful
lacing
in
its
wake
however
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
a
very
slight
haze
but
just
enough
to
be
noticeable
this
had
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
to
the
nose
suggesting
an
allmalt
cream
ale
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
there
was
a
grassiness
to
the
hops
that
worked
well
with
the
malt
to
create
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
finish
was
semidry
and
very
refreshing
once
more
thanks
to
it
relatively
low
abv
i
can
easily
envision
myself
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
or
better
with
a
fresh
soft
pretzel
choosing
a
cream
ale
as
a
flagship
beer
for
a
new
brewery
seems
a
bit
odd
but
grey
sail
pulled
it
off
this
is
an
allaround
solid
beer
more
interesting
than
the
average
cream
ale
if
only
these
came
in
tallboys
enjoyed
with
dinner
at
trios
restaurant
in
narragansett
ri
this
brew
presents
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
giant
white
pile
of
foam
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
subtle
floral
lemon
blend
that
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
too
polite
perhaps
the
flavor
offers
a
biscuit
wheat
and
somewhat
watery
cabbage
sort
of
deal
kind
of
musty
skunky
a
papery
wheat
its
light
bodied
but
offers
a
nice
evenly
carbonated
feel
that
refreshes
and
finishes
with
a
dry
tongue
the
flavor
is
somewhat
unique
a
bit
perfumey
not
really
my
thing
but
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
worth
trying

i
dont

of
experience
or
depth
with
this
style
but
this
is
a
very
simple
and
drinkable
brew
without
much
complexity
an
easy
session
beer
for
the
summer
that
would
go
great
with
grilling
overall
this
is
a
style
often
ignored
by
brewers
so
its
nice
to
see
another
one
around
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beer
types
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
just
fine
o
not
a
remarkable
beer
but
it
is
quaffable

overall
its
nothing

worth
having
some
of
in
the
fridge
thanks
jonah
for
sending
this
and
allowing
me
to
be
the
first
nonrhode
islander
to
review
it
o
this
is
a
great
session
beer
comes
in
cans
as
well
the
draft
version
had
more
hop
character
but
even
so
this
is
solid
cream
ale
ill
be
drinking
this
on
the
beach
in
the
summer
and
loving
it
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
od
the
canned
version
is
worth
trying
fairly
hoppy
for
the
style
good
beer
to
go
along
with
bar
food
probably
wont
get
any
of
your
beernerd
friends
excited
price
is
steep
at
almost
9
for
a
six
pack
of
12
oz
compared
to
all
the
other
quality
choices
by
other
breweries
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
else
these
guys
have
to
offer
overall
however
im
pleased
that
this
will
be
the
flagship
brew
for
a
new
rhode
island
brewery
if
people
start
drinking
this
regularly
they
may
soon
realize
how
nasty
narragansett
is
overall
not
nearly
as
much
cinnamon
as
i
expected
overly
boozy
and
sweet
not
great
not
like
any
cream
ale
ive
ever
tasted
theres
not
a
lot
of
cinnamon
here
but
at
the
same
time
i
kind
of
imagine
that
if
you
mixed
and
ale
with
the
milk
leftover
from
a
bowl
of
cinnamon
toast
crunch
it
might
taste
like
this
not
something
id
drink
regularly
but
not
bad
at
all
pdubs
wrote
a
check
and
this
bottle
cashed
it
with
cinnamon
goodness
for
days
would
complain
because
its
not
crunchy
but
it
is
beer
after
all
pick
it
up
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
it
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
and
malty
but
nothing
like
the
description
would
lead
you
to
believe
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
thats
fairly
malty
the
ingredients
kind
of
lead
you
to
believe
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
rumchata
style
beer
but
comes
off
as
more
like
a
heavy
marzen
brew
nice
but
not
what
i
would
have
expected
from
the
label
another
pipeworks
kitchen
sink
beer
that
doesnt
work
think
more
white
russian
and
less
cream
ale
sweet
and
tasty
nonetheless

with

very
faint

presence

undetectable
taste
has
a
huge
big
sweetness
upfront
with
notes
of

and

huge
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
that
leaves
a
rubbing
alcohol
flavor
on
the
palate
moderately
carbonated
thick
and
sticky
not
sure
why
this
is
being
called
a
cream
ale
as
there
is
nothing
even
reminiscent
of
one
in
here
interesting
beer
smells
like
milk
approaching
its
expiration
with
some
cinnamon
cereal
soaking
in
it
tastes
like
cream
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
finishes
like
a
cream
soda
spiked
with
vodka
or

interesting
cream
ale
definitely
get
a
hint
of
cinnamon
that
comes
through
very
smooth
an
old
school
style
cream
ale
reminded
me
of
what
my
grandad
used
to
drink
in
the
summer
while
watching
the
phillies
it
poured
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
white
creamy
head
the
smell
was
a
classic
clean
hopped
odor
the
taste
was
very
good
it
has
light
refreshing
malty
and
smooth
taste
i
could
drink
these
all
summer
it
has
a
smooth
champagne
feel
going
on
its
like
a
miller
lite
or
a
budweiser
but
it
has
more
taste
to
it
i
go
for
more
bitter
beers
but
i
like
this
one
just
a
good
cream
ale
rated
on
style
drinkable
but
nothing
special
decent
aftertaste
light
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
great
clarity
light
sweetness
in
the
aroma
most
likely
from
the
additions
of
corn
and
sugar
with
floral
hops
coming
through
at
the
end
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
a
crisp
smooth
finish
light
in
body
and
a
breeze
to
drink
a
very
clean
ale
with
no
off
flavors
a
pleasant
easy
sipper

just
not
a
fan
of
this
style
o
great
session
brew
from
must
try
craft
brewer
not
sweet
action
but
a
good
2nd
place
in
category
overall
a
decent
and
easy
drinker
for
what
it
is
not
exactly
a
style
that
receives
a
lot
of
love
on
this
site
and
not
exactly
a
style
youd
think
of
having
on
a
cold
wintry
day
like
today
but
just
imaging
a
hot
steamy
august
with
a
can
in
your
hand
pure
refreshment
smells
and
looks
like
a
beer
id
have
in
college
nothing
much
happening
lack
of
taste
almost
smells
stale
not
a
fan
drank
out
of
glass
but
have
had
before
yellow
a
finger
of
head
little
carbonation
sweet
boozy
even
for
the
low
abv
there
is
alcohol
heat
a
little
bitter
but
subtle
hops
decent
malt
i
wish
it
had
more
carbonation
i
liked
it
but
wont
buy
again
for
a
bit
even
though
it
is
a
good
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
and
yes
since
you
asked
that
can
did
reach
me
by
way
of
the
incredible
woodychandler
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
kind
of
mild
some
grains
and
malts
are
present
taste
is
grains
bready
malts
a
bit
of
lemon
a
good
thirst
quencher
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
beer
and
probably
would
be
better
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
billowy
fluffy
white
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
bread
cereal
and
cornmeal
aromas
with
light
floral
and
metallic
notes
at
the
end
smooth
delicate
creamy
feel
with
a
light
crispness
near
the
end
bready
malt
and
corn
flavors
up
front
followed
by
light
tangy
herbal
hops
through
the
middle
herbal
bitterness
overtakes
the
sweet
bready
malt
at
the
end
as
this
finished
with
a
semidry
crispness
and
lingering
yeasty
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
overall
a
decently
easy
drinking
and
less
sweet
cream
ale
a
good
session
style
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
bit
fuller
in
character
than
you
might
expect
of
a
cream
ale
but
not
quite
a
blonde
ale
enjoyed
a
pint
on
tap
at
pjs
in
medford
slightly
hazy
light
amber
appearance
topped
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
like
a
wheat
soda
cracker
with
a
touch
of
toffee
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
caramel
on
the
finish
even
with
such
a
low

still
has
a
great
mouthfeel
with
enough
chewiness

give
it
some
character

would
call
this
a
pale
ale
and
is
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
easily
better
than
anything
bud
miller
or
coors
has
ever
put
out
id
drink
this
january
is
just
not
the
right
season
for
it
for
me
can
golden
body
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
thin
ring
of
white
head
aromas
are
pretty
muted
as
the
beer
is
quite
cold
grain
and
lightly
tart
apples
light
sweetness
finishing
with
a
meld
of
bittering
hops
and
fruity
sweetness
pretty
good

who
needs
natty
boh
when
you
got
this
a
big
thanks
to
the
incredible
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
some
citrus
taste
is
crisp
grapefruit
light
hops
refreshing
and
smooth
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
solid
brew
one
i
probably
would
have
enjoyed
more
in
the
summertime
i
love
hearing
the
crack
since
that
is
one
of
the
many
things
that
make
canned
beer
so
special
it
was
yet
another
brimful
can
and
to
celebrate
i
canducted
an
inverted
pour
my
efforts
created
two
foamy
fingers
of
soapy
bonewhite
head
that
fell
fairly
quickly
leaving
great
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
bright
sunshinelike
yellow
srm
4
and
by
bright
i
mean
nequality
clarity
nose
had
notes
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
and
my
mouth
was
watering
mouthfeel
was
medium
the
nose
really
translated
to
taste
in
this
case
it
had
a
light
grapefruit
bitterness
initially
followed
by
a
pineapple
sweetness
in
the
mouth
finish
was
semidry
not
really
sweet
enough
to
be
cansidered
otherwise
tis
was
a
great
summertime
beer
easy
drinking
and
one
that
i
could
have
used
this
afternoon
when
doing
yard
work
prost
i
wanted
to
like
this
locallybrewed
six
pack
of
cans
cleverly
marketed
for
the
independence
day
weekend
for
which
i
bought
it
i
had
delusions
of
sitting
shirtless
in
the
backyard
with
these
in
an
icy
cooler
by
my
side
but
it
tastes
like
an
inside
joke
of
lets
put
natty
boh
in
a
craft
can
and
see
how
it
goes
over
sour
only
grudgingly
drinkable
i
think
a
better
craft
salute
to
american

such
as

effervescent
this
comes
from
cold
spring
mn
so
it
didnt
travel
far
the
color
is
a
pale
clear
gold
with
very
little
carbonation
there
is
almost
no
smell
the
very
mild
taste
is
slightly
sweet
just
tangy
enough
to
make
the
mouth
water
but
not
withdraw
hint
of
lemon
slightly
bitter
edge
and
it
feels
creamy
i
added
a
thin
slice
of
lemon
partway
through
with
the
lemon
i
would
give
it
an
extra
half
point
especially
on
a
hot
day
it
could
be
crispermore
carbonated
very
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
decent
for
the
style
and
a
solid
companion
for
a

this

fits

pleasant

a

than
an

nothing
inspirational
fine
for

pale
yellow

with

fairly

some

faint

unassuming
wheat
grain
are
the
forefront
of
a
mild

its
not
offensive
in
any
way
and
has
a
fairly
clean

im
looking
for
other
things
to
say
about
it
it
seems
a
step
or
two
above
a
mass

adjunct

would
be
easy
to
swig
down
a
six
pack
right
now
in
november
in
mn
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
cheers
great
beer
for
an
easy
drink
a
beer
that
you
could
start
a
new
beer
drinker
on
creamy
and
a
nice
color
when
poured
out
a
beer
that
is
going
to
taste
better
on
tap
9
times
out
of
10
satisfying
and
perfect
with
food
3rd
street
has
a
nice
brew
here
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
ale
and
a
minnesota
brew
rise
to
the
top
is
good
no
doubt
about
it
read
the
other
reviews
i
agree
with
99
of
what
they
say
hey
i
live
within
a
stones
throw
of
the
brewery
and
am
proud
that
3rd
street
brewhouse
has
been
able
to
survive
while
others
have
taken
the
deep
6
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
style
of
cream
ales
long
before
i
was
an
experienced
beer
snob
scene
1979
beach
bum
w
bent
antenna
static
box
blaring
pop
am
and
a
cooler
filled
with
iced
ponies
of
blatz
light
cream
ale
beach
bum
me
now
that
was
a
tasty
beer
course
i
didnt
care
much
for
the
domestic
american
swill
passed
off
as
beer
back
in
those
days
so
this
beer
was
like
an
enlightening
premium
craft
at
the
time
it
beat
out
little
kings
by
a
long
shot
unfortunately
it
is
long
gone
now
the
cream
ale
style
is
suppose
to
be
a
category
that
i
would
basically
describe
as
lagered
ales
top
fermented
ales
that
are
cold
conditionedstored
i
think
it
is
a
category
any
homecraft
brewer
could
have
a
fun
and
creative
craft
with
that
said
rise
to
the
top
by
the
third
street
brewhouse
should
be
a
basis
for
a
continuation
of
exploring
this
style
but
not
an
end
result
i
only
have
blatz
light
cream
ale
and
little
kings
for
comparison
and
they
are
very
distant
memories
and
blatz
is
still
winning
the
memory
course
im
not
a
wheat
beer
fan
either
so
id
give
this
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
and
anyone
having
a
copycat
recipe
for
blatz
light
cream
ale
pop
it
to
me
will
ya
final
thoughts
pleased
with
this
one
took
a
chance
with
purchasing
such
a
light
beer
but
it
was
worth
it
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
will
be
checking
out
3rd
streets
other
offerings
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
probably
in
the
summer
though
as
it
is
currently
below
freezing
outside
its
light
and
pleasant
as
a
cream
ale
should
be
rating
for
the
style
its
good
but
not
much
better
than
the
cheaper
geneseesp
cream
ale
probably
tastes
a
bit
better
tho
overall
until
new
glarus
decides
to
bring
spotted
cow
to
minnesota
unlikely
this
is
probably
the
best
thing
were
going
to
get
its
got
a
couple
of
minor
kinks
but
its
easy
to
recommend
this
beer
due
to
its
drinkability
and
simple
flavor
since
this
is
my
first
beer
from
third
street
brewhouse
im
looking
forward
to
trying
out
more
of
their
brews
which
the
have
to
offer
o
ill
buy
this
again
its
good
and
i
love
finding
a
good
minnesota
beer
onothing
overly
complex
but
for
a
cream
ale
this
is
well
done
much
much
better
than
spotted
cow
if
you
want
to
draw
comparisons
thought
this
was
a
little
better
on
draft
but
still
a
decent
beer
out
of
the
bottle
o
its
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
cream
ales
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
o
super
cream
ale
that
a
nice
smooth
taste
highly
session
able
good
stuff
overall
not
bad
esp
for
a
summer
ale
yup
tastes
like
a
wellmade
cream
ale
which
is
odd
because
i
wonder
how
many
people
go
out
in
search
of
cream
ales
any
ways
its
crisp
and
light
with
a
mellow
bready
almost
yeasty
malt
character
thats
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
dough
and
freshbaked
break
theres
a
macrolike
touch
as
is
appropriate
with
the
sweet
dry
finish
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
likely
summer
crowdpleaser
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
for
the
style
very
subtle
flavors
but
whats
there
is
nice
another
light
style
to
try
in
this
hot
summer
i
get
corn
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
but
the
label
and
website
both
dont
mention
any
corn
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
and
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
overall
well
it
is
better
than
spotted
cow
which
is
the
most
massively
overhyped
beer
i
can
think
of
among
the
more
mainstream
beer
drinkers
easy
drinking
and
i
guess
it
is
a
strong
example
of
the
style
but
not
my
thing
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
bright
white
foam
that
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
bread
and
tangy
wheat
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
fits
that
style
nicely
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
considerably
stronger
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
nice
round
malty
flavors
that
really
make
the
thought
of
taking
another
sip
sound
appealing
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
cream
ale
that
i
can
see
myself
drinking
again
im
pretty
impressed
if
one
is
looking
for
big
and
complex
this
isnt
it
but
for
a
mild
beer
this
offers
very
satisfying
flavors
not
the
most
exciting
style
but
on
a
hot
day
these
go
down
so
nicely
maybe
this
will
be
minnesotas
spotted
cow
as
it
is
on
par
with
wisconsins
favorite
great
smooth
not
too
hoppy
caramel
like
aftertaste
love
this
beer
crappy
beer
boring
can
not
worth
it
overall
hats
off
to
you
newburgh
i
feel
fortunate
to
try
what
is
now
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
keep
up
the
good
work
i
could
pound
this
stuff
and
enjoy
the
flavor
at
the
same
time
great
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
i
have
gotten
a
few
growlers
of
it
already
and
plan
on
keeping
it
on
hand
at
all
times
newburgh
bc
is
doing
some
good
things
down
on
the
waterfront
a
few
gulps
in
very
impressive
the
balance
and
dryness
builds
up
the
drinkability
wheat
and
oat
add
the
element
of
creaminess
and
a
bit
of
depth
on
the
way
down
a
smaller
brew
but
being
all
malt
it
was
great
to
see
a
very
liberal
hand
for
hopping
here
cheers
to
newburgh
for
helping
redefine
this
style
16oz
tall
boys
would
be
a
treat
if
they
get
into
canning
definitely
drink
this
beer
thanks
to
the
incredible
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malty
taste
is
of
malts
clean
refreshing
a
touch
of
rye
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
as
advertised
is
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
the
crack
unleashed
a
fair
amount
of
foam
so
i
backed
off
and
allowed
things
to
settle
just
a
bit
before
proceeding
it
was
certainly
a
brimful
can
but
i
was
unsure
that
volume
was
the
root
cause
and
so
i
went
with
a
gentle
pour
this
was
the
right
idea
as
mounds
of
pillow
bonewhite
head
immediately
formed
and
threatened
to
overmount
the
edge
of
the
glass
i
was
left
with
just
over
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
as
a
result
color
was
a
murky
lemonadeyellow
srm
3
7
nose
had
a
grassiness
to
it
that
made
me
look
up
the
hops
varieties
being
used
bravo
was
the
aroma
hop
but
i
was
curious
to
see
what
apollo
was
going
to
do
to
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
effervescent
paving
the
way
for
the
riot
of
flavors
to
come
citrus
tropical
fruit
black
pepper
and
freshlymown
grass
all
came
to
mind
this
was
not
the
cream
ale
of
my
misspent
youth
lemme
tell
ya
great
lacing
began
to
form
and
cling
to
the
interior
of
my
glass
as
i
pondered
this
beer
the
finish
was
semidry
with
the
rye
providing
a
lingering
black
pepper
taste
that
stuck
in
the
back
of
my
throat
color
me
impressed
if
this
truly
fits
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
then
i
would
highly
recommend
loading
up
with
some
for
the
upcoming
summer
if
not
then
cansume
at
will
but
know
that
it
is
a
very
different
iteration
of
the
style
what
makes
this
a
cream
ale
i
have
no
idea
but
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
are
loving
this
brew
its
simple
easydrinking
and
good
c
body
is
light
high
carbonation
super
easy
drinking
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
creme
ale
and
deserves
a
very
high
score
done
overall
this
is
a
good
everyday
beer
and
it
seems
ideal
for
warm
weather
consumption
the
refreshing
character
and
more
easy
going
nature
make
it
a
good
choice
for
a
warm
summer
day
it
isnt
like
other
cream
ales
but
that
might
actually
be
a
good
thing
as
i
cannot
think
of
many
cream
ales
that
i
like
very
much
cheers
taste
shows
honeyed
grains
leading
the
charge
with
some
fruity
yeast
undertones
hops
are
light
on
flavor
and
aroma
but
definitely
have
a
touch
of
bittering
to
clean
things
up
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
well
done
it
has
a
sweet
side
but
is
certainly
not
cloying
and
finishes
dry
enough
carbonation
level
is
good
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
dang
good
rendition
of
the
style
problem
is
there
is
not
much
competition
for
it
ive
yet
to
have
a
spotted
cow
id
put
it
above
genessee
and
little
kings
by
a
mile
buy
a
notch
below
av
summer
solstice
fantastic
i
will
buy
more
and
i
look
forward
to
visiting
the
restaurant
o
will
buy
again
performs
as
advertised
certainly
not
the
next
pty
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
dirty
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
some
strong
banana
notes
as
well
as
some
cream
and
wheat
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
some
sweet
malt
and
a
lot
of
banana
and
wheat
a
handful
of
flavors
that
dont
really
go
well
together
overall
the
beer
tastes
like
a
mess
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
not
good
hopefully
the
brewery
will
improve
as
they
get
more
experience
o
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
cheap
beer
that
can
be
bought
in
large
quantities
its
definitely
better
than
some
of
the
other
lawnmower
beers
that
people
seem
to
love
so
much
seemingly
would
be
perfect
for
college
frat
parties
or
just
when
you
want
a
cheap
refreshing
beer
that
does
just
enough
to
be
decent
picked
up
just
because
of
the
stubby
bottles
and
cheap
price
clear
straw
super
pale
good
carbonation
taste
is
kind
of
boozy
for
some
reason
but
was
a
good
beer
perhaps
nostalgia
made
it
taste
for
me
slight
maltiness
followed
by
fruit
then
its
over
the
stubby
bottle
and
the
label
would
get
a
5
from
me
if
aesthetics
in
packaging
were
a
category
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
very
small
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
slight
sweet
finish
actually
very
smooth
with
a
good
taste
lots
of
poor
publicity
in
rochester
area
blind
tasting
confirms
its
a
great
beer
smooth
and
easy
to

smooth
and
creamy
but
still
refreshing
hood
wheat
smell
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
can
design
is
simple
and
cool
i
think
that
though
not
obviously
the
pinnacle
of
anything
this
beer
is
somewhat
iconic
it
is
underrated
cheap
and
fills
a
niche
that
some
people
believe
only
this
brand
can
it
is
a
classic
and
i
love
my
forest
green
simplicity
hey
it
genny
a
good
everyday
kind
of
beer
that
is
more
complex
and
tastes
better
than
a
lot
of
people
give
it
credit
for
nothing
mind
blowing
here
just
good
simple
beer
you
can
enjoy
at
a
excellent
price
overall
i
ordered
this
off
of
the
beer
list
under
your
daddys
beers
it
also
had
dixie
lonestar
and
iron
city
listed
it
was
a
nice
throw
back
to
my
teen
age
years
do
not
let
the
almighty
pluck
you
off
the
planet
before
getting
yourself
a
cream
ale
its
a
delightful
pint
nice
taste
and
enjoyable
end
had
not
had
in
along
time
good
smoothe
brew
not
bad
great
for
a
buck
this
is
an
old
beer
that
hasnt
changed
in
a
long
time
flattish
was
beer
of
last
resort
when
kids
and
is
now
i
was
weaned
on
this
beer
i
cant
help
but
love
it
not
a
beer
to
guzzle
or
to
get
a
buzz
on
too
heavy
but
great
to
enjoy
one
or
two
with
a
nice
stogie
or
by
itself
if
you
enjoy
a
that
smooth
yet
bitter
texture
basically
its
the
poor
mans
boddingtons
a
creamy
bitey
ale
at
a
bargain
price
very
good
cream
ale
the
best
cheep
beer
out
there
if
you
can
find
it
4
1
a
stark
white
thick
foam
with
great
retention
and
lacing
color
is
a
clear
sickly
yellow
sweet
corn
and
semblance
of
flavor
is
the
result
for
the
flavor
dept
very
watery
and
uninteresting
though
who
the
hell
could
chug
a
whole
monster
can
of
this
yup
its
pretty
okay
ive
had
worse
and
ive
had
better
cream
ales
dont
judge
where
have
you
been
genny
new
go
to
cheap
beer
when
taste
buds
need
a
break
easy
drinking
not
sure
wouldnt
like
it
many
years
ago
on

rare
that
dont
finish
a
beer
even
beers
i
dont
like
i
can
finishe
but
this
was
not
one
of
them
maybe
i
had
a
bad
can
it
tasted
metallic
and
very
amateurish
this
not
a
complex
beer
at
all
i
would
rather
drink
a
bud
than
take
another
sip
of
this

decent
tasting
beer
the
after
taste
irks
me
a
little
bit
a
real
winner
here
highly
recommended
o
a
classic
if
youre
from
anywhere
around
new
york
to
heck
with
nostalgia
the
grim
reality
of
why
its
been
a
quarter
of
a
century
between
purchases
struck
hard
it
is
a
great
25cent
beer
for
somebody
on
a
very
tight
budget
pbr
seems
to
fill
that
bill
with
those
darn
whippersnappers
today
but
this
stuff
just
cant
stand
on
its
own
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
taste
and
the
feel
the
nose
started
things
off
on
an
overly
adjuncty
cheap
foot
there
was
not
sweetness
or
creaminess
to
be
noted
with
little
else
of
anything
at
all
for
that
matter
the
flavoring
made
up
for
this
a
bit
but
it
was
overly
simplified
in
its
bittering
graininess
regardless
of
what
you
say
about
this
or
how
you
rate
it
this
is
a
rochester
staple
and
anyone
from
the
area
should
be
proud
to
toast
of
glass
of
it
from
time
to
time
have
been
disappointed
lately
with
the
new
can
exterior
graphic
design
makes
it
look
generic
or
something
purchased
at
a
dollar
store
although
the
great
taste
of
the
ale
beer
i
would
be
embarassed
to
ofer
it
to
a
friend
it
looks
soooo
cheap
the
can
is
pretty
cool
looking
too
i
would
drink
this
more
often
but
the
pricepoint
where
i
live
makes
it
not
worth
the
price
o
interesting
beer
it
looks
line
an
aal
not
much
smell
light
but
pleasant
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
finishes
dry
with
no
real
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
beer
i
care
to
try
again
bland
and
with
that
criteria
i
give
it
a
85100
in
the
pounder
beer
category
overall
not
bad
much
less
terrible
than
i
expected
just
a
touch
of
corn
and
dried
malt
extract
flavor
a
very
light
tinny
skunk
flavor
as
i
think
the
can
helps
and
overall
decent
malt
and
hop
flavors
surprised
as
hell
and
for
1
for
a
24oz
can
you
cant
beat
that
pours
a
clear
golden
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
cream
hint
of
hops
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
hint
of
rice
fits
the
style
of
a
cream
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
hint
of
cream
and
a
hint
of
ricecorn
overall
the
cream
aroma
and
body
are
weak
and
the
cornrice
flavor
is
prevalent
in
both
body
and
feel
i
reckon
this
is
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
poured
from
a
24oz
can
into
a
lager
glass
poured
like
absolute
shit
due
to
it
being
so
carbonated
and
from
a
huge
can
seriously
had
to
stop
and
continue
the
pour
multiple
times
because
it
kept
wanting
to
run
down
the
side
of
the
can
and
onto
my
jeans
anyway
pours
a
very
adjunct
like
medium
yellow
with
a
two
finger
bubbly
white
head
leaving
half
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
of
cooked
vegetables
rice
and
some
corn
adjunct
nothing
more
nothing
less
tasted
like
a
light
lager
and
almost
completely
follows
the
nose
this
beer
must
have
been
wrongly
marketed
as
a
cream
ale
because
it
has
no
characteristics
of
a
a
cream
ale
whatsoever
it
seriously
tastes
like
a
light
lager
without
the
artificial
metallic
aftertaste
also
the
beer
starts
to
taste
very
heavily
of
rubbing
alcohol
as
you
get
further
into
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
brings
nothing
additional
to
the
table
in
terms
of
anything
overall
the
beer
isnt
offensive
definitely
not
a
cream
ale
however
due
to
its
easy
drinkability
ill
give
it
a
slightly
higher
score
in
this
category
would
i
buy
it
again
no
notes
born
and
raised
in
rochester
area
this
beer
was
a
rite
of
passage
in
the
early
60s
had
to
try
it
again
didnt
think
it
was
as
strong
as
it
used
to
be
after
a
night
of
this
beer
you
were
very
aromatic
and
hung
over
not
bad
for
what
it
is
would
still
pound
a
couple
on
a
hot
day
down
at
hamlin
beach
state
park
not
to
be
kept
in
your
reefer
i
bought
this
can
from
my
local
bodega
i
choose
this
particular
beer
based
on
not
knowing
anything
about
it
pours
an
idyllic
macro
appearance
pale
yellow
soapy
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
isnt
bad
corn
malt
sweetness
and
a
faint
hop
presence
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
beyond
that
there
isnt
a
lot
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
otherwise
this
beer
would
be
a
little
thin
overall
if
i
had
1
50
for
a
beer
budget
this
would
not
be
a
bad
choice
at
all
not
in
any
way
offensive
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
of
corn
taste
is
nice
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
neutral
light
bitterness
pretty
straightforward
average
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
but
not
too
bad
overall
a
decent
beer
better
than
your
average
macro
o
my
go
to
beer
many
years
ago
as
a
student
living
in
upstate
ny
this
was
cheap
and
more
interesting
if
not
actually
better
than
the
dominant
products
from
ab
and
miller
many
years
later
this
is
not
particularly
interesting
or
complex
but
a
decent
lager
for
a
hot
day
above
average
for
the
price
point
even
here
in
the
south
3
25
easier
to
drink
than
a
malt
liquor
says
my
brother
decent
enough
cream
ale
worth
buying
if
you
find
it
cheap
enough
d
d
overall
this
is
actually
a
decent
cream
ale
i
call
it
refreshing
and
decently
tasty
using
overall
for
my
drinkability
score
this
rates
pretty
good
o
since
this
is
actually
my
first
cream
ale
i
dont
want
to
necessarily
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
this
is
the
best
for
its
style
but
i
will
say
that
this
is
very
good
if
evaluated
mainly
on
its
taste
i
would
have
this
again
price
point
99
for
a
24oz
can
pours
out
golden
with
minimal
head
that
fades
to
white
blotching
with
no
lacing
smells
of
faint
corn
cob
grain
husk
and
cooked
vegetables
taste
consists
of
malt
sweetness
grains
and
a
little
booze
tad
bit
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
and
refreshing
with
moderate
carbonation
nice
change
from
some
of
the
bigger
beers
out
there
overall
its
cheap
and
refreshing
not
much
else
going
on
here
overall
easy
drinker
and
light
definitely
a
light
summer
beer
to
substitute
for
bud
or
something
else
odecent
and
cheap
enough
to
maybe
make
this
a
goto
for
this
summer
much
liike
yuengling
was
for
me
last
summer
paid
99
with
no
tax
or
deposit
for
24
oz
can
on
military
post
in
new
england
it
was
a
sweet
deal
for
me
since
this
can
would
set
you
back
two
bucks
in
the
south
poured
from
can
down
the
side
of
pint
glass
purposely
left
no
remarkable
head
but
a
thin
lacing
remained
throughout
drinking
period
darker
than
your
average
lager
but
lighter
than
your
average
ale
smell
is
not
repelling
but
not
the
best
taste
is
bready
sweet
at
first
then
slightly
sour
definite
caramel
with
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
tons
of
bubbles
and
they
stick
around
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
pair
with
pizza
and
cheesy
foods
and
genny
definitely
got
the
price
right
rock
on
genny
overall
a
decent
brew
i
had
this
out
the
bottle
and
into
a
czech
pilsner
glass
cost
me
0
80
at
my
favorite
bottleshop
guntown
beer
if
you
are
in
the
market
for
a
drinkable
beer
for
a
price
that
will
virtually
not
affect
the
wallet
at
all
genesee
is
your
beer
hands
down
overall
this
is
only
the
second
cream
ale
ive
ever
tried
its
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
drink
on
it
all
night
but
its
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
little
kings
cream
ale
i
tried
that
stuff
was
great
o
better
than
expected
but
pretty
much
a
common
lager
for
some
reason
today
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
genesee
cream
wow
i
remember
my
old
man
and
his
best
friend
drinking
this
in
the
late
70s
early
80s
the
hunting
cabin
in
prattsville
ny
and
probably
the
prattsville
tavern
as
well
i
myself
hadnt
had
this
in
quite
some
time
and
picked
up
a
12
pack
today
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
most
drinkable
brews
i
have
had
no
nasty
aromas
or
after
tastes
to
be
had
and
maintains
a
thin
cream
like
head
throughout
its
thin
but
its
there
far
exceeds
any
offerings
from
bmc
good
jod
genesee
keep
it
up
p
s
our
thoughts
are
with
the
people
of
prattsville
ny
hope
to
see
you
all
soon
at
the
tavern
taste
is
blander
than
the
smell
typical
old
man
beer
tastes
like
your
uncles
breath
smells
its
sweet
and
grainy
as
old
man
beers
go
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
though
good
job
genesee
body
is
light
bordering
on
medium
it
attempts
a
creamy
finish
that
it
just
cant
seem
to
pull
off
with
that
said
it
is
certainly
thirst
quenching
and
not
unpleasant
in
the
mouth
at
all
not
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
o
for
a
more
macrobeer
this
is
better
than
most
but
still
not
something
that
i
would
consider
better
than
average
overall
certainly
not
the
best
cream
ale
that
i
have
experienced
and
certainly
not
the
worst
if
the
aromas
of
the
beer
were
better
it
would
be
a
huge
improvement
in
the
enjoyability
i
have
not
had
this
beer
since
college
in
the
early
to
mid
1990s
but
it
tasted
exactly
as
i
remembered
it
o
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
the
strongest
points
of
this
beer
the
taste
isnt
anything
special
but
then
again
isnt
overly
bad
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
picked
up
a
thirty
pack
for
15
for
my
brothers
birthday
because
he
is
a
cream
ale
fan
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
very
slow
still
resulted
in
a
four
finger
head
luckily
the
head
recedes
very
quickly
to
a
bright
white
foam
cap
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
the
cap
stuck
around
for
the
remainder
of
th
drink
and
left
behind
lacing
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
glass
the
body
of
the
beer
was
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
million
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
unfortunatly
this
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
smell
and
taste
were
like
someone
poured
cream
soda
over
corn
flakes
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
corn
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
to
thin
body
with
good
carbonation
creamy
feel
with
a
slight
hops
presence
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
cream
ale
worth
trying
o
a
pretty
average
cream
ale
across
the
board
it
goes
down
smooth
and
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
about
it
pretty
unimpressive
and
really
not
that
good
of
a
beer
not
quite
sure
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
had
in
a
bottle
perhaps
it
was
too
old
nonetheless
it
had
an
unbearable
sour
flavor
with
no
real
redeeming
quality
very
light
body
which
was
expected
but
the
flavor
missed
on
all
marks
its
too
bad
as
very
few
cream
ale
crafts
are
on
the
market
my
favorite
cheap
beer
12
for
30
not
as
clean
tasting
as
your
average
lager
has
some
taste
going
on
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
great
adjunct
beer
as
far
as
lawn
mower
brews
go
this
should
be
at
the
top
of
anyones
list
and
the
best
thing
about
it
is
the
price
is
truly
right
o
at
3
99
for
6
bottles
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
not
something
ill
buy
regularly
for
myself
but
it
has
its
place
in
a
party
setting
o
this
doesnt
really
compare
with
a
good
cream
ale
but
its
a
decent
example
for
the
1
99
price
for
a
22
oz
overall
for
its
price
and
style
a
good
brew
nothing
working
pining
over
but
a
good
session
beer
for
those
of
us
without
disposable
income
m
light
body
medium
carbonation
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
probably
not
something
i
would
knock
back
a
lot
of
but
certainly
something
to
change
the
pace
o
i
didnt
hate
it
at
a
dive
bar
with
no
other
beer
options
id
order
a
pint
of
genny
cream
ale
in
a
heartbeat
why
not
its
a
wny
tradition
the
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
but
it
definitely
feels
fuller
then
most
comparable
macros
overall
its
a
good
beer
when
compared
to
others
in
its
class
and
price
range
its
smooth
crisp
relatively
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
im
from
western
new
york
so
this
is
a
staple
in
many
of
my
friends
houses
still
im
always
happy
to
choose
this
one
out
of
their
fridge
before
any
other
macro
they
may
have
in
there
i
think
this
beer
compares
very
favorable
to
others
in
its
class
but
overall
i
recognize
that
its
not
really
going
to
compare
nearly
as
favorable
to
more
expensive
craft
versions
o
a
decent
inexpensive
adjunct
no
problem
grabbing
a
few
of
these
when
on
a
budget
o
more
of
the
same
from
genny
it
is
another
very
average
sweet
and
sticky
beer
o
moderate
cream
ale
and
for
the
price
a
good
beer
but
there
are
many
better
cream
ale
purchased
a
few
24
oz
cans
at
the
local
stopnsteal
for
99
apiece
plus
10
cents
deposit
cause
i
live
in
mi
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
to
report
its
color
and
smell
it
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
thick
foamy
head
and
decent
retention
and
lacing
honestly
it
smells
pretty
awful
do
yourself
a
favor
and
just
drink
it
out
of
the
can
as
with
the
genesee
ice
it
tastes
a
lot
better
out
of
the
can
conclusion
its
better
than
bud
miller
or
coors
lt
its
cheap
infinitely
drinkable
and
cheap
just
dont
pour
it
out
of
the
can
while
this
beer
is
nothing
special
per
se
i
do
appreciate
it
more
than
most
of
the
standard
lagers
and
cream
ales
out
there
it
is
very
crisp
clean
i
find
more
carbonated
than
average
but
seems
to
please
groups
of
people
that
try
it
its
definitely
worth
revisiting
if
you
want
something
in
this
vein
the
price
isnt
bad
either
cheers
o
a
good
cream
ale
in
fact
genny
screamers
have
been
a
around
in
my
family
for
a
long
long
time
drink
its
a
pretty
average
beer
but
doesnt
as
i
say
offend
me
or
make
me
want
to
pour
it
has
a
good
smooth
finish
genesee
cream
ale
is
my
first
venture
into
the
cream
ale
style
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
however
the
ale
is
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
for
it
in
terms
of
flavor
i
would
classify
this
as
a
beer
that
youd
drink
after
working
on
the
yard
all
afternoon
its
a
beer
that
sacrifices
taste
in
favor
of
being
refreshing
a
decent
change
up
from
macros
without
making
them
heavy
or
tough
to
drink
a
good
option
to
pound
many
of
and
get
drunk
without
drinking
a
totally
crappy
beer
at
first
glance
this
beer
looks
and
smells
iaverage
it
pours
a
light
creamy
color
with
a
bit
of
creamy
head
and
an
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
the
beer
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
goes
down
smoothly
a
very
worthy
effort
indeed
definitely
a
must
for
any
fan
of
cream
ales
o
not
bad
but
not
particularly
good
would
probably
be
a
good
intro
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
as
it
is
not
overpowering
in
any
aspect
overall
3
5
hey
its
genny
cream
what
were
you
looking
for
all
things
considered
not
so
bad
notes
ok
beer
not
quite
as
sweet
creamy
corny
flavored
as
some
cream
ales
more
like
a
sweet
light
lager
fruitiness
is
interesting
but
im
not
sure
exactly
whether
i
like
it
or
not
not
bad
for
a
very
cheap
beer
reviewed
from
notes
enjoyed
many
times
over
the
years
formally
reviewed
here
for
the
first
time
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
into
genesee
cream
ale
pilsner
glass
with
a
good
mix
of
carbonation
that
yields
a
decent
head
of
about
a
half
an
inch
to
an
inch
smell
of
corn
a
bit
of
yeast
and
general
sweetness
taste
is
good
and
clean
with
a
sweetness
of
corn
and
a
very
mild
ale
finish
coats
the
mouth
and
tongue
pretty
well
as
it
should
for
a
cream
style
ale
very
good
for
the
price
and
the
style
and
lately
has
replaced
pbr
and
even
lil
kings
cream
ale
as
my
go
to
cheapy
session
beer
to
have
on
hand
with
the
good
stuff
better
the
the
usual
bmc
suspects
i
wish
genesee
would
revert
back
to
the
old
school
design
from
the
late
70searly
80s
as
this
canbottle
design
reminds
me
more
of
a
soda
pop
can
then
a
beer
great
price
13
99
for
30
cans
bright
yeller
like
my
xterra
and
a
running
white
head
sweet
corn
and
a
little
sour
mash
in
the
nose
light
malts
and
some
hints
of
grains
are
all
there
is
to
it
but
truly
better
than
other
beers
ive
had
with
the
same
palate
i
could
pound
like
ten
of
these
for
smoothness
of
body
this
could
be
a
go
to
beer
games
beverage
nothing
huge
here
just
a
smooth
beer
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
beers
out
there
cheaper
around
here
than
a
lot
of
aals
and
way
better
too
ogood
but
not
great
could
be
an
easy
everyday
go
to
drink
o
this
would
be
my
go
to
beer
if
i
wanted
something
on
the
cheap
side
that
actually
tasted
like
more
than
watered
down
bmc
crap
overall
this
doesnt
even
taste
creamy
in
fact
it
taste
like
regular
genny
but
weaker
not
much
to
say
about
this
but
it
could
be
worse
i
suppose
im
from
upstate
new
york
and
went
to
college
near
rochester
so
genny
was
always
the
running
joke
of
what
a
cheap
beer
was
but
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
well
see
with
the
other
genny
beers
this
is
one
of
my
perennial
favorites
going
back
to
the
early
70s
nothing
like
a
couple
of
jennies
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
in
colora
very
pleasant
aroma
great
taste
a
more
than
one
beer
and
not
bad
even
straight
from
the
can
well
known
in
the
new
york
metro
area
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinkin
when
you
got
time
or
work
to
do
i
like
the
bottles
and
some
the
cans
but
the
best
is
draft
beer
creamers
the
guv
used
a
fill
jugs
of
draft
cream
ale
and
bringem
to
the
fire
station
in
caroga
they
tasted
good
but
next
morning
i
was
on
the
can
for
quiet
a
while
all
in
all
pretty
much
what
i
expected
but
not
worse
the
weirdest
thing
for
me
was
that
it
was
nearly
as
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
even
at
room
temp
which
kicks
the
rating
up
just
a
notch
in
my
book
plus
at
a
buck
for
a
24oz
can
its
barker
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
drinkable
flavor
is
fine
again
leadiff
sweetness
a
dry
finish
i
drank
the
whole
thing
but
i
doubt
i
would
bother
having
any
more
than
that
it
reminded
me
too
much
of
a
cheap
lager
and
not
like
a
thoughtful
beer
o
not
a
bad
upgrade
from
aal
and
bmc
but
nothing
special
this
tastes
similar
to
what
i
remember
having
as
a
youth
with
cans
floating
in
penns
creek
that
fisherman
anchored
with
rocks
the
grain
is
there
with
an
almost
bready
yeast
and
sweet
adjunct
flavor
in
the
background
not
too
high
like
cornpops
but
noticeable
and
it
seems
light
in
the
hops
department
which
is
standard
considering
this
is
the
american
immigrants
version
of
a
helles
more
or
less
the
taste
finishes
semidry
and
overall
i
was
satisfied
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
malt
flavor
and
some
adjunct
backing
it
up
vs
the
other
way
around
which
most
of
the
macro
variety
seem
to
be
overall
this
is
definitely
a
better
than
average
beer
that
is
hard
to
beat
for
the
price
there
is
nothing
here
that
is
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
different
taste
that
keeps
it
interesting
reviewers
note
just
say
no
to
twistoffs
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
nice
distinct
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
and
unbaked
bread
dough
taste
is
of
sweet
grains
and
corn
flakes
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
as
i
have
never
seen
this
anywhere
else
in
california
o
it
hits
the
spot
im
sure
ill
be
more
impressed
by
the
8pack
of
fancy
schmancy
brewery
ommegang
ales
i
bought
alongside
this
can
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
and
1
20
for
a
24
oz
can
is
a
steal
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
thea
roma
is
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
lemon
mixed
in
as
the
beer
gets
a
little
warmer
i
start
to
get
some
bubblegum
notes
similar
to
what
you
get
in
some
german
wheat
beers
the
flavor
doesnt
have
any
of
the
bubblegum
in
it
but
it
goes
have
a
lot
of
wheat
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
cream
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
rjt
overall
if
this
beer
had
a
bolder
flavor
and
milder
carbonation
it
would
be
a
decent
beer
this
however
is
a
little
weak
but
being
from
western
pa
originally
its
a
beer
i
seem
to
pick
up
at
least
once
a
year
notes
my
2nd
genesee
beer
today
this
is
substantially
better
than
genesee
beer
as
the
aroma
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
all
better
very
refreshing
a
real
summer
session
beer
at
the
price
this
would
be
the
beer
to
buy
on
a
budget
overall
not
bad
for
a
cheap
light
brew
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
sometimes
you
want
something
like
that
overall
this
is
a
simple
but
pleasant
beer
it
made
some
very
good
beercan
chicken
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
while
cooking
a
good
summertime
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
o
glad
i
tryed
it
its
not
nasty
but
not
great
either
o
nothing
special

overall
plain

not
as
good
as
i
remembered
from
the
1990s
but
still
a
respectable
effort
for
a
99
cent
tallboy
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
cream
ale
and
the
best
one
i
have
had
to
date
it
was
a
pretty
light
and
subtle
flavored
brew
that
had
awesome
drinkability
i
could
drink
more
then
a
couple
of
these
during
the
day
especially
during
a
couple
rounds
of
disc
golf
its
goes
down
smooth
and
is
quite
refreshing
which
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
even
though
this
is
a
cream
ale
and
not
an
adjunct
lager
i
still
feel
they
are
both
in
the
same
league
and
are
very
similar
and
when
comparing
this
with
the
macro
lagers
the
cream
ale
comes
out
on
top
all
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
nice
and
unoffensive
just
like
it
should
be
i
would
take
one
of
these
over
any
of
the
major
macros
any
day
of
the
week
i
would
buy
this
again
it
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
and
it
was
an
excellent
choice
for
beer
can
chicken
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
refreshing
and
sessionable
cream
ale
then
grab
a
genny
cream
after
buying
this
on
a
whim
for
beer
can
chicken
i
have
become
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
it
is
now

go

is

but
the

has
a
good
effect
while
this
beer
is
not
a
sample
of
something
i
would
give
to
special
beer
drinking
guests
i
would
keep
some
on
hand
in
the
hot
georgia
summer
days
when
i
had
to
venture
out
and
work
in
the
yard
and
for
the
price
this
beer
is
not
bad
at
all

its
fine

i
got
one
can
from
the

and
dont
have

more

is

really

it

that
quickly
dissolves
smells
of
sweet
roasted
vegetables
flavors
of
sweet
corn
and
fruit
nectar
decent
creamy
body
way
cheaper
than
a
macro
lager
and
more
enjoyable
to
drink
not
something
ill
be
having
very
often
but
ill
certainly
opt
for
it
over
an
adjunct
this
is
my
grandfathers
favorite
beer
hes
been
drinking
this
since
i
dont
know
when
anyway
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
some
head
that
fades
instantly
the
smell
is
a
little
sweet
mostly
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
decent
creaminess
to
it
but
nothing
too
over
the
top
here
the
mouthfeel
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
this
one
alive
the
beer
for
me
is
respectable
because
of
my
grandfather
he
drinks
it
so
i
drink
it
with
him
too
its
a
bonding
moment
with
genny
overall
not
a
bad
macro
certainly
better
than
any
bmc
product
pretty
good
quality
for
a
cheap
price
o
for
a
cheap
mainstream
beer
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
always
pick
up
14
a
30
rack
is
pretty
cheap
for
a
beer
that
absolutely
trumps
all
bud
miller
and
coors
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
is
usually
the
one
i
go
after
when
i
am
looking
for
cheap
beer
although
pbr
gets
me
sometimes
too
good
stuff
for
what
it
is
im
gonna
say
it
its
an
old
timer
ale
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
quickly
receding
head
lacing
slides
down
to
meet
the
beer
big
corn
smell
also
smells
very
lagery
the
taste
meets
it
there
and
if
i
werent
looking
at
that
can
id
guess
its
a
lager
now
that
i
look
at
the
can
it
claims
at
me
flavor
of
a
fine
ale
and
the
smoothness
of
a
premium
lager
i
cant
pinpoint
the
aleness
but
id
agree
it
drinks
like
a
lager
crisp
carbonation
light
body
what
you
would
call
an
outdoor
beer
i
gotta
say
im
not
big
on
it
knowing
what
else
is
out
there
in
the
category
overall
decent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
im
not
familiar
with
the
cream
ale
style
i
feel
like
ive
definitely
had
the
style
before
in
the
form
of
adjunct
lager
this
isnt
something
id
seek
out
but
its
a
nice
alternative
to
bmc
when
looking
to
drink
several
beers
over
the
course
of
a
hot
summer
day
i
liked
the
creaminess
and
its
definitely
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
say
that
its
a
top
tier
beer
or
anything
but
its
certainly
better
than
other
cheap
beers
at
this
price
point
i
mean
5
29
a
6
pack
odi
am
a
bit
torn
if
i
am
to
purchase
a
30pack
i
am
clearly
buying
some
rather
low
quality
beer
if
i
am
going
to
do
this
i
want
to
spend
as
little
money
as
possible
this
beer
is
very
inexpensive
but
i
have
trouble
drinking
several
of
these
the
flavor
seems
to
be
an
upgrade
from
the
rest
but
after
a
few
it
gets
much
harder
to
drink
i
could
conceivably
opt
to
purchase
a
more
watereddown
macro
because
i
will
at
least
be
able
to
drink
more
than
four
had
to
grab
a
second
bottle
o
this
after
the
one
i
was
gonna
try
was
nicked
by
my
girlfriend
after
she
demeaned
by
homebrewed
esb
the
nerve
of
some
people
right
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
stark
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
corn
and
a
touch
of
sweet
flowers
the
taste
bases
itself
on
this
successful
novel
but
the
director
went
too
damn
avantgarde
with
it
resulting
in
a
campy
hackerslike
hard
water
flavor
dousing
the
whole
production
and
a
sad
excuse
for
an
opening
pull
those
poor
investors
and
to
to
think
theyd
just
gotten
over
the
calamity
of
insidious
the
body
is
a
light
with
pretensions
of
heft
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
okay
cream
ale
but
that
hard
water
flavor
ruins
things
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
still
it
somehow
retains
a
good
amount
of
its
drinkability
so
though
i
dont
think
ill
be
grabbing
a
case
o
this
any
time
soon
i
wont
spit
on
someone
if
they
offer
it
to
me
later
on
genesee
cream
ale
is
a
typical
cheap
beer
in
every
way
it
has
a
typical
head
that
pours
thick
and
dissipates
quickly
it
smells
like
every
cheap
beer
that
ive
ever
smelled
smells
like
i
think
its
corn
and
grain
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
other
cheap
beers
because
it
does
taste
creamy
oddly
enough
i
dont
get
a
creamy
mouth
feel
just
a
typical
fizzy
bubbly
feel
overall
this
beer
is
average
its
drinkable
and
for
1
00
its
worth
a
try
genesees
cream
ale
from
24oz
can
into
standard
16oz
pint
pours
golden
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
smells
like
grains
corn
and
a
bit
of
musk
tastes
pretty
good
to
be
such
a
cheap
offering
light
malts
a
bit
of
steamed
veggies
corn
husks
and
a
strange
lactose
like
presense
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
mellow
as
the
can
indicates
almost
silky
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
will
get
a
few
more
to
have
around
hopefully
they
will
drop
these
in
30pk
12oz
cans
near
my
house
i
would
honestly
drop
my
milwaukees
best
ice
for
this
one
cheers
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
today
on
a
whim
16oz
cans
six
of
em
for
4
99
now
thats
value
ive
bought
7oz
bottles
for
more
than
that
anyhow
this
beer
is
one
of
the
first
that
my
dad
shared
with
me
many
many
years
ago
and
a
few
years
before
i
was
legal
pours
a
bright
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
cap
smells
like
creamed
corn
slightly
sweet
grainy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
taste
is
a
sweet
grainy
with
hints
of
apple
and
maybe
some
floral
hops
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
think
about
it
a
bit
waterycreamy
mouthfeel
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
certainly
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
nothing
really
offensive
either
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
golden
color
with
a
medium
head
smell
of
corn
and
cream
tastes
very
smooth
mouthful
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
drinkabilty
is
wonderful
a
6
99
a
six
pack
this
beer
is
a
really
good
steal
would
recommend
this
beer
for
you
average
joe
cant
go
wrong
with
a
24
ounce
can
for
95
cents
not
a
horrible
beer
and
far
from
the
worse
this
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
to
have
a
lot
of
with
friends
pours
a
typical
clear
amber
but
it
least
it
has
a
fairly
thick
and
somewhat
persistent
white
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
nothing
special
but
at
least
its
ok
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
just
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
nothing
special
but
still
enjoyable
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
fizzy
this
is
better
as
a
party
beer
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
meal
than
a
standalone
drink
but
its
still
all
right
cant
argue
with
the
drinkability
on
this
one
id
tear
these
up
in
the
summer
and
the
creamy
light
feel
makes
me
feel
less
guilty
about
drinking
something
like
this
from
the
16
fl
oz
can
no
335007
sampled
on
march
4
2011
the
pour
is
a
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
foamy
longlasting
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderate
in
malts
adjuncts
and
even
a
bit
of
yeast
but
low
in
hops
the
taste
has
this
slight
yeastiness
believe
it
or
not
with
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
during
the
finale
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
classic
macros
of
course
this
would
not
be
high
on
a
craft
beer
enthusiasts
want
list
but
it
refreshes
just
the
same
d
im
good
for
a
few
of
these
its
a
nice
change
once
in
a
while
esp
for
the
price
but
hard
to
get
through
more
than
a
few
with
out
becoming
bored
very
bored
this
beer
is
a
session
beer
in
my
book
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
its
notably
heavier
in
body
than
a
light
beer
and
about
the
same
compared
to
a
lager
only
it
has
some
depth
that
you
just
dont
get
out
of
the
big
three
and
in
in
other
macro
lagers
this
beer
is
the
only
cream
ale
that
ive
had
up
to
now
but
judging
by
my
impressions
from
it
this
is
a
style
for
me
ill
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
other
cream
ales
to
try
in
the
future
had
this
on
tap
at
anchor
bar
in
buffalo
comes
to
the
table
pale
yellow
without
any
head
whatsoever
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
watered
down
corn
syrup
i
think
surprisingly
high
carbonation
given
there
is
no
head
carbonation
this
high
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
get
the
beer
down
id
rather
most
macro
lagers
over
this
i
think
for
99
cents
a
can
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
values
going
seriously
why
are
people
making
a
big
fuss
over
big
flats
when
you
can
get
the
same
amount
of
genny
cream
for
the
same
price
for
the
style
and
the
price
this
is
honestly
an
exceptional
brew
poured
from
a
24
oz
aluminum
can
into
a
pint
glass
genesee
cream
ale
is
a
deep
goldenyellow
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
lightly
fruity
and
fairly
strong
with
adjuncts
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
lightly
fruity
with
a
maltadjunct
grain
finish
hops
only
to
balance
and
even
that
is
on
the
light
side
carbonation
is
creamy
but
the
beer
itself
is
incredibly
light
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
drinkable
beer
very
economical
too
this
24
oz
can
cost
me
99
slightly
above
average
drinkability
and
the
key
factor
here
is
15
dollar
30
geney
cream
cans
overall
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
for
what
it
is
its
not
half
bad
cheap
drinkable
and
i
guess
you
can
consider
it
local
i
would
go
for
one
of
these
again
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
say
a
coors
banquet
but
still
decent
has
a
bit
more
flavor
not
in
a
good
way
but
there
is
a
hint
of
cream
which
on
the
other
hand
is
nice
i
would
rank
it
better
than
bud
and
coors
light
for
sure
better
overall
taste
i
have
a
tradition
on
super
bowl
sunday
i
go
to
frank
and
teresas
anchor
bar
on
main
street
in
buffalo
to
pick
up
some
original
chicken
wings
while
waiting
for
my
order
i
enjoyed
a
nice
genny
cream
because
i
thought
it
would
make
the
experience
most
authentic
the
ale
had
a
very
pleasant
bright
yellow
appearance
its
bouquet
was
subtle
it
was
very
refreshing
to
drink
served
ice
cold
it
is
certainly
different
from
the
more
complex
beers
ive
been
samplind
lately
yet
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
i
like
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
taste
some
sweet
corn
some
hops
its
your
basic
mild
tasting
medium
strength
beer
i
enjoy
beer
of
this
general
style
just
as
long
as
they
dont
bite
me
back
and
after
downing
24
ozs
in
short
order
im
here
to
say
that
this
is
pretty
good
beer
you
can
do
better
but
its
nice
filler
i
think
i
would
call
this
an
below
average
beer
pouring
a
pale
golden
with
creamy
lacing
this
has
an
adjunct
scent
up
front
with
maybe
a
trace
of
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
and
sweeter
than
a
traditional
lager
but
lighter
in
body
than
most
ales
a
decent
if
unremarkable
middle
grounder
for
the
craft
beercurious
d
if
i
want
to
put
back
a
few
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
if
i
plan
on
having
a
long
night
i
also
light
to
support
locals
a
pretty
good
budget
beer
try
it
sometime
drinkability
where
can
i
pour
it
out
at
drinkable
dry
finish
thanks
again
santa
adam
for
a
brew
i
most
likely
would
have
never
bought
so
not
have
had
a
chance
to
try
i
poured
this
into
a
sam
adams
glass
and
was
greeted
with
a
great
three
finger
white
fluffy
head
on
top
of
a
clear
golden
yellow
body
i
got
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
coming
from
the
nose
with
a
light
floral
hop
note
there
as
well
it
was
sweet
and
crisp
in
my
mouth
with
a
light
bitter
finish
it
had
a
light
mouthfeel
and
great
carbonation
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
i
cold
have
had
a
few
more
for
the
price
i
see
on
six
packs
i
think
its
not
bad
but
i
like
narragansett
as
a
local
favorite
better
for
a
cheap
drinking
beer
notes
what
do
you
buy
when
all
the
good
beer
stores
are
closed
on
xmas
go
to
the
gas
station
this
is
better
than
your
basic
bmc
beer
but
is
very
reminiscent
of
it
drinkability
is
so
so
decent
refreshing
lager
i
think
but
its
certainly
not
one
i
would
revisit
value
youll
be
searching
for
a
long
time
to
find
a
beer
that
can
beat
this
one
for
four
bucks
a
six
pack
great
choice
when
youre
waitin
on
pay
day
great
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amount
of
co2
not
harsh
at
all
very
drinkable
one
of
the
easiest
40s
to
down
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
especially
if
i
can
find
it
on
tap
what
a
value
overall
the
first
sip
of
this
was
easily
the
worst
but
as
i
became
accustomed
to
the
flavors
i
found
it
to
be
quite
palatable
obviously
not
worth
seeking
out
but
not
a
terrible
beer
for
the
style
d
another
anodyne
thirst
quencher
but
then
it
is
a
cream
ale
both
similar
to
and
different
from
bmc
it
does
have
a
touch
more
flavor
both
in
amplitude
and
complexity
d
sure
listen
its
genesee
so
it
is
what
it
is
its
a
decent
beer
for
drinking
and
a
good
price
i
would
grab
one
way
before
budcoors
its
not
a
duvel
but
its
good
for
bbqs
it
brought
me
back
25
years
to
my
18
year
old
time
grabbing
em
out
of
my
fathers
frig
a
bit
more
body
and
sweetness
is
just
enough
to
push
it
past
bmc
standards
not
a
great
beer
or
a
style
exemplar
but
drinkable
when
its
there
d
look
i
am
a
local
guy
for
an
adjunct
macro
brew
that
is
produced
100
miles
west
i
can
run
with
genny
cream
not
bad
d
pretty
low
abv
so
it
is
session
able
but
not
that
much
going
on
not
bad
but
not
great
t
this
was
just
a
one
time
try
type
of
thing
i
probably
will
never
have
this
beer
again
not
to
much
taste
or
refreshing
for
the
price
of
this
beer
it
isnt
a
bad
choice
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
if
you
are
looking
for
something
differennt
to
your
normal
beer
and
are
short
on
cash
this
couod
be
a
alright
one
to
try
i
got
through
the
rest
of
the
can
without
any
problem
so
the
drinkability
is
there
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
if
given
limited
options
i
might
grab
this
again
the
price
is
certainly
right
the
mouthfeel
can
be
the
most
important
part
of
a
beer
and
this
beer
was
lacking
which
leads
to
what
i
think
causes
the
best
drinkability
if
you
can
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
its
drinkability
will
be
consistent
i
drank
it
quickly
wanting
nothing
more
then
to
get
it
out
of
the
glass
so
i
could
poor
a
sweetwater
ipa
i
really
enjoy
finding
a
cheap
beer
with
this
much
character
at
least
get
it
a
try
i
am
glad
i
did
feel
is
full
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
feel
of
sweetness
that
isnt
really
there
thus
the
creaminess
though
the
style
is
a
bit
aside
an
enjoyable
brew
actually
a
bit
sweet
when
flat
a
bit
of
intriging
grain
otherwise
pours
a
pale
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
decent
lacing
smells
creamy
and
malty
and
somewhat
old
tastes
of
cream
of
wheat
and
mild
malt
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
bought
this
because
24
ounce
cans
from
this
brewery
were
5
for
5
at
my
local
beer
store
for
the
price
you
really
cant
do
much
better
refreshing
beer
i
wont
fo
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
but
a
six
pack
is
wonderful
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
2
finger
head
and
leaving
nice
lacing
typical
american
adjunct
and
munich
helles
lager
appearance
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
some
fresh
grassy
notes
not
hop
aromas
maybe
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
nose
the
flavor
has
a
bitterness
that
doesnt
suggest
creaminess
to
me
overall
is
comparable
to
a
regular
american
adjunct
lager
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
blend
but
it
has
that
lager
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
what
this
beer
lacks
is
a
lightness
that
makes
this
easy
to
put
a
couple
away
may
e
its
from
the
ingredients
i
dont
know
but
i
do
like
this
better
than
the
typical
bmc
products
out
there
12oz
bottle
picked
up
in
a
mixed
sixer
from
total
wine
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
super
clear
pale
gold
with
a
small
white
head
on
top
wisps
of
lace
stick
behind
scents
of
butter
apples
and
honey
pretty
mellow
mouth
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
for
the
style
and
brewer
i
guess
thats
not
all
that
surprising
mild
carbonation
pretty
sweet
cream
ale
starts
out
with
a
bit
of
honey
pale
fruits
and
grains
low
bitterness
not
a
bad
beer
to
be
had
at
cookouts
or
campouts
or
even
some
tailgating
refreshing
simple
beer
md
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
much
like
water
but
its
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
as
most
adjunct
lagers
are
genesee
cream
ale
is
very
similar
to
pabst
blue
ribbon
in
my
opinion
both
beers
are
poked
fun
at
but
if
you
compare
them
to
the
standard
bmcs
they
are
clearly
better
and
even
cheaper
t
while
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
good
for
what
it
is
would
drink
this
over
bmc
any
day
glad
to
see
it
made
its
way
up
to
maine
d
wouldnt
reach
for
this
one
again
because
there
isnt
much
to
actually
enjoy
for
me
taste
is
light
creamy
grain
and
apple
with
grass
sweetish
with
a
slight
alelike
yeasty
zing
that
is
a
faint
hint
that
this
is
something
other
than
a
pale
lager
it
has
a
rather
creamy
frothy
feel
to
it
it
has
some
creamy
grain
aftertaste
though
light
though
simple
what
character
it
has
is
reasonably
firm
and
its
very
pleasant
for
a
cream
ale
it
is
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
will
be
retired
for
the
winter
d
you
can
pick
up
a
30
rack
of
this
for
the
same
price
as
a
four
pack
of
dfh
burton
baton
when
the
money
is
tight
this
beats
a
lot
of
cheap
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
not
a
stunner
by
any
means
but
certainly
not
terrible
thats
all
she
wrote
overall
for
a
quick
adjunct
its
not
the
worst
i
had
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
would
be
drinkable
all
in
all
this
is
a
dressedup
version
of
your
typical
macro
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
id
always
buy
it
over
the
macro
alternatives
skål
nostalgia
aside
this
isnt
a
particularly
good
beer
unless
its
cold
it
really
gets
dextriny
and
cloying
sweet
when
it
even
starts
to
settle
the
beer
has
a
really
processed
feel
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
doesnt
retain
at
all
the
beer
is
plenty
carbonated
with
a
nose
that
has
a
processed
corn
adjunct
aroma
some
malty
sweetness
and
some
herbal
grassy
qualities
interestingly
the
sharp
edges
in
the
nose
actually
level
out
and
it
becomes
quite
nice
once
it
settles
which
is
just
the
opposite
or
what
happens
with
its
taste
once
the
beer
warms
even
a
little
the
beer
takes
on
some
very
nasty
qualities
lots
of
dextriny
adjunct
processed
grainy
qualities
and
is
indicative
of
the
quality
or
lack
of
it
underlying
the
beer
drink
it
while
its
cold
same
goes
for
taste
what
i
like
about
this
that
the
adjunct
lagers
dont
have
is
a
crisper
flavor
that
is
the
malt
isnt
stale
the
corn
isnt
strong
a
light
flavor
all
around
with
a
touch
of
dryness
in
the
end
served
colder
this
one
would
be
ok
in
a
pinch
genesee
cream
ale
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
frothy
head
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
some
sweet
corn
like
maltiness
the
flavor
is
light
sweet
malt
with
some
faint
fruity
esters
that
linger
in
the
aftertaste
no
real
bitterness
or
hop
character
to
speak
of
overall
considering
the
price
of
the
beer
its
not
terrible
one
of
the
better
values
out
there
this
is
a
whaddyawant
kind
of
beer
yes
its
weak
but
its
got
a
little
flavor
it
is
what
it
is
ive
had
better
traditional
american
offerings
at
the
very
least
i
can
say
its
a
slight
alternative
to
typical
macro
lagers
but
only
veeery
slight
a
decent
barbecue
beer
one
to
put
away
a
few
of
if
theres
nothing
else
pours
pale
straw
yellow
with
virtually
no
lasting
head
medium
carbonation
aroma
smells
sweet
more
than
anything
else
with
hints
of
graininess
and
floral
hops
flavor
sweet
too
with
something
tasting
like
honey
dominating
with
hints
of
adjunct
and
malt
flavor
as
well
slight
amounts
of
floral
hops
and
grain
bitterness
on
the
finish
thin
to
medium
in
body
drinkable
but
meh
genny
creamthis
brew
goes
back
a
long
way
with
me
my
grandfather
used
to
drink
the
pony
cansbottles
when
i
was
a
kid
remeber
the
taste
well
just
had
one
last
night
for
first
time
in
maybe
20
years
you
know
not
bad
at
all
still
has
a
bit
of
an
distinct
creamy
flavor
and
feel
def
more
medium
bodied
that
a
typical
inexpensive
brew
for
4
50
a
sixpack
its
worth
a
try
plus
it
brought
back
some
fond
memories
and
thats
priceless
never
had
a
cream
ale
before
so
it
is
difficult
to
rate
to
style
does
have
a
similar
flavor
profile
of
an
adjunct
lager
although
this
is
certainly
better
than
bmc
however
looking
at
a
list
of
other
cream
ales
makes
me
think
there
are
going
to
be
many
others
better
than
this
in
the
category
well
a
hot
day
would
suit
this
fine
or
if
you
were
just
using
this
to
wash
down
food
i
will
take
this
any
day
of
the
week
over
bud
or
bud
light
flawed
a
bit
too
weak
and
some
elements
that
dont
really
work
but
still
no

boy
can
one
of
the
better
cheap
beers

can
get

not

for
the
price
you
pay
ive
seen
it
go
for
as
low
as
14
99
for
a
30rack
drinkability
is
certainly
there
that
doesnt
sacrifice
a
somewhat
prevalent
flavor
and
body
d
ya
know
its
not
as
horrendous
as
i
remember
it
perhaps
even
a
bit
above

as
far
as
run
of
the
mill
macro
beers
go
i
wont
be
buying
30
racks
of
genny
cream
ale
anytime
soon
but
i
may
look
for
a
can
the
next
time
im
at
a
college
party
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
even
though
it
is
not
the
best
i
have
had
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
and
as
we
all
know
the
more
you
drink
the
better
they
get
i
like
this
beer
just
not
a
favorite
its
pretty
drinkable
but
will
probably
not
pick
this
up
again
feeldrink
cream
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
great
drinkability
for
less
than
13
a
30pk
this
may
be
my
goto
cheap
beer
d
not
the
best
cream
ale
out
there
but
its
not
bad
i
dont
know
if
it
would
be
sessionable
or
not
though
d
one
of
the
classic
old
school
beers
not
very
exciting
but
not
off
putting
either
very
much
a
neither
here
nor
there
beer
in
my
book
i
found
a
sixer
of
this
at
whibey
beer
works
recently
and
had
to
buy
it
i
grew
up
on
genesee
beers
and
have
never
seen
them
west
of
the
mississippi
river
i
have
no
idea
how
this
beer
git
here
or
how
it
was
handled
im
mostly
entering
this
just
to
add
it
to
my
list
im
just
giving
an
average
score
until
i
try
a
fresh
one
on
my
next
trip
home
drinkability
gets
a
5
only
because
i
used
to
drink
so
much
of
this
stuff
ive
got
to
give
props
to
my
homie
notes
this
is
a
regional
beer
from
upstate
ny
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
and
although
it
wasnt
great
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
that
is
not
made
by
inbev
and
at
14
99
a
30
pack
it
wont
break
any
bank
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
i
bought
it
in
a
six
pack
of
16
ounce
cans
for
2
99
this
is
a
great
value
i
will
definitely
by
a
few
more
of
these
sixers
this
summer
ahh
the
1st
beer
i
got
drunk
on
in
the
early
80s
makes
me
wonder
why
i
stopped
drinking
it
a
good
stand
by
when
i
cant
get
some
micro
or
import
which
happens
a
lot
in
conneaut
ohio
smooth
easy
drinking
and
cheap
here
in
ohio
better
than
the
rest
of
the
bmc
corn
piss
that
is
out
there
good
to
see
genesee
got
its
name
back
always
ask
for
jenny
notes
this
is
along
the
lines
of
a
premium
adjunct
lager
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
arent
great
but
there
is
actually
some
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
also
helps
to
improve
it
overall
poured
to
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
color
is
clear
golden
yellow
dissimilar
from
most
macros
in
that
it
is
more
golden
than
the
typical
straw
yellow
smell
is
very
sweet
oddly
enough
the
taste
didnt
represent
the
sweet
smell
i
cant
believe
im
saying
this
but
you
can
actually
tell
hops
lies
within
this
beer
its
very
faint
but
still
there
great
feel
in
the
mouth
and
going
down
this
is
a
good
macro
cheers
cheers
i
would
say
the
reviews
about
this
beer
are
fairly
on
point
my
local
beer
distributor
has
it
on
sale
for
around
13
50
for
a
30
pack
so
you
really
cant
beat
that
me
being
21
years
old
the
man
working
there
always
says
im
too
young
for
genesse
cream
ale
and
that
gives
me
a
laugh
i
enjoy
everything
about
it
except
for
the
metallic
taste
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
but
for
the
price
i
would
put
up
with
a
lot
worse
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
i
remember
my
neighbor
drinking
while
growing
up
found
it
relatively
cheap
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
this
is
certainly
not
worth
the
beer
medals
it
claims
to
have
won
but
honestly
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
affordability
and
availability
make
this
beer
drinkable
but
not
very
good
drinkability
no
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
better
than
normal
adjuncts
though
although
still
grainy
and
a
bit
acrid
it
has
a
sweeter
aspect
in
the
finish
and
a
smoother
creamier
mouthfeel
compared
to
typical
widely
distributed
adjunct
lagers
because
of
this
the
drinkability
at
least
for
me
goes
op
a
few
notches
id
take
this
over
most
other
cheap
beers
any
day
d
i
dont
like
it
not
too
sure
ill
even
drink
this
whole
sixer
t
has
a
sourish
malt
taste
smooth
yet
has
some
carbonation
too
american
marcro
but
not
horrible
either
d
im
sure
there
are
many
who
session
the
genny
on
the
regular
but
theyre
also
likely
to
be
in
their
60s
and
70s
at
this
point
wont
do
any
harm
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
macro
guzzler
with
a
bit
of
street
cred
to
it
has
an
old
school
feel
and
a
modern
largely
inoffensive
chugging
lager
flavor
ive
had
it
in
a
bottle
wegmans
in
dewitt
ny
once
sold
12
pack
bottles
and
this
was
my
favourite
budget
beer
it
looks
like
your
average
macro
product
with
its
white
head
and
golden
body
and
may
smell
like
a
macro
but
its
got
a
sweet
sugar
cookie
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
usual
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
can
into
glass
even
with
a
slow
pour
it
yielded
4
fingers
of
foamy
head
lots
of
carbonated
bubbles
still
coming
to
the
top
basic
yellowgolden
beer
color
smells
of
corn
and
cooked
rice
smooth
flavor
nothing
really
sticks
out
but
basic
malted
brew
flavor
more
cornrice
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
somewhat
watery
very
drinkable
in
that
it
is
very
smooth
and
nothing
offensively
harsh
not
a
beer
id
go
far
and
wide
to
seek
out
but
if
it
was
this
over
any
other
macro
except
for
rainier
or
olympia
id
still
go
with
this
one
d
genny
cream
ale
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
budgetbrews
it
is
far
more
interesting
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
at
its
price
point
perfect
for
the
poor
college
crowd
d
if
i
am
going
to
put
down
a
bunch
of
light
beers
i
have
no
problem
grabbing
some
genny
over
some
bmc
there
probably
is
a
little
nostalgia
too
as
i
spent
some
time
in
wny
rachacha
its
deceptively
light
at
first
but
ends
up
having
more
character
that
youd
expect
from
a
macro
despite
being
full
of
adjuncts
flavor
and
almost
devoid
of
hops
this
is
a
good
standby
for
when
you
need
a
simple
beer
to
gulp
down
this
is
an
absolute
steal
at
about
7
per
12pack
its
a
staple
party
beer
but
its
also
satisfying
when
you
want
to
just
kick
back
its
a
sleeper
as
in
a
previous
review
i
agree
that
it
appeals
to
many
every
day
beer
drinkers
it
has
a
very
nice
head
with
an
exceptional
color
of
amber
goes
down
very
smooth
i
picked
up
a
30
pack
consumers
beer
depot
in
milwaukee
wish
i
would
have
purchased
3
or
4
11
99
i
remember
my
uncles
drinking
genny
cream
ale
when
i
was
a
kid
now
that
im
of
age
while
not
deep
has
a
lot
of
brightness
rye
and
country
brown
bread
pear
fruit
the
metallic
element
less
of
a
presence
here
even
as
it
warms

great
beer
to
have
on
hand
not
boring
no
lacing
at
all
smell
is
also
typicial
of
an
american
macro
the
budget
often
dictates
my
choice
at
sams
but
having
said
that
this
beer
was
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
i
went
into
this
brew
with
very
low
expectations
and
was
surprised
by
how
quickly
it
was
able
to
rise
to
unimpressive
status
appearance
is
golden
with
almost
no
head
little
to
no
lacing
is
apparent
as
you
force
down
this
incredibley
below
average
brew
the
finish
leaves
you
with
a
hollow
feeling
slightly
malty
taste
is
of
malts
with
some

5hard
to
believe
but
i
found
some
jenny
cream
here
near
seattle
and
in
a
bottle
so
i
had
to
buy
one
from
my
home
town
of
rochester
comes
one
of
the
few
american
origin
styles
with
a
foamy
white
head
has
a
lagery
aroma
goes
down
very
easily
but
its
better
than
all
the
other
macros
and
for
3

a

pack
you
really
cant
go

i
will
definately
purchase
this
again

the

very

the

was
much
sweeter
than
i
had

and
it
also
had
a

this

i
can
detect
some

with

the

this

is
a
bargain
when
its
around
ill
never
have
to
settle
for
an
overly
popular
macro
with
faint
citrusy
tinges
if
you
really
want
to
notice
them
the
taste
and
smell
are
very

maltiness
with
little
detectable
hops
and
a
pronounced

clean

d
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
but
would
not
buy
again
though
when
i
first
poured
it
i
thought
it
was
a
pilsner
drinkability
for
the
price
there
are
much
better
beers
but
if
it
was
cheap
and
i
was
broke
why
not
notes
blah
blah
blah
these
adjunct
tasting
brews
get
really
old
why
do
i
continue
to
buy
them
as
the
blues
brothers
would
say
im
on
a
mission
from

all

amen
it
doesnt
hurt
that
it
is
less

a

even
tho
the
ratings
here
on

do
not
favor
well
for
the
old
genny
i
myself
love
to
drink
them
for
the
price
and
think
it
was
time
i
wrote
a
favorable
review
in
her
defence
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
step
up
from
typical
mass
market
brews
but
only
a
small
step
this
is
my
favorite
im
poor
and
cant
afford
better
beer
laps
other
cheap
beers
by
miles
the
cream
ale
style
is
key
here
actually
its
better
than
i
expected
i
would
drink
this
in
a
pinch
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
a
weakness
for
this
beer
as
i
drank
way
too
much
of
it
as
a
young
juvenile
delinquent
it
really
isnt
that
bad
especially
when
compared
to
crap
like
bud
lite
miller
lite
etc
still
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
is
to
get
a
buzz
those
who
live
in
their
local
distribution
area
are
rather
fortunate
to
have
such
an
aboveaverage
beer
for
such
an
inexpensive
price
this
beer
hits
the
style
guidelines
pretty
well
i
think
its
under
appreciated
plus
its
usually
a
real
bargin
my
first
beer
from
high
falls
pours
out
to
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
and
higher
carbonation
some
notes
of
lacing
in
the
glass
not
much
smell
although
some
malt
and
light
hops
flavor
is
decent
some
corn
grain
malt
and
hops
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
overall
and
a
zesty
finish
mouthfeel
was
fair
good
carbonation
and
medium
light
body
better
than
average
drinkability
this
beer
would
go
good
with
a
hot
dog
or
bratwurst
during
a
football
game
and
for
the
price
its
a
deal
a
good
macro
made
cream
ale
ill
spare
the
blast
from
the
past
reminiscences
but
genny
cream
in
7
ounce
bottles
was
a
staple
from
my
younger
days
i
had
forgotten
what
it
tastes
like
for
all
i
know
though
the
flavor
has
been
monkeyed
around
with
several
times
over
the
years
in
any
case
this
is
an
inexpensive
get
what
you
pay
for
kind
of
beer
that
is
drinkable
in
a
pinch
no
one
buys
this
stuff
expecting

ale
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
monstrous
white
puffy
that
fell
to
a
thin
coating
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
taste
is
light
and
refeshing
with
a
slight
dryness
aftertaste
is
also
a
bit
dry
and
makes
you
want
more
easy
to
drink
not
at
all
bad
for
a
cheap
beer
this
beer
is
over
carbonated
and
overall
not
impressive
it
is
a
weak
attempt
at
a
cream
with
a
bland
flavor
and
definite
macro
impression
the
aroma
is
mediocre
with
a
grainy
presence
that
dominates
the
beer
as
a
whole
this
one
is
no
better
than
a
american
macro
from
st
louis
or
milwaukee
this
stuff
actually
isnt
bad
for
a
macro
im
not
gonna
lie
it
stayed
in
the
can
but
ill
make
an
educated
guess
at
the
appearance
light
golden
almost
yellow
color
way
too
many
bubbles
and
a
pretty
nonexistent
head
unless
youre
getting
it
from
a
keg
in
which
half
your
cup
would
be
a
foamy
mess
the
taste
actually
is
a
little
bit
creamy
which
i
like
its
not
just
beer
flavored
water
almost
but
not
quite
definately
some
adjuncts
in
there
however
mouthfeel
is
actually
fairly
medium
bodied
for
a
macro
decent
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
not
be
totally
offended
by
the
taste
definately
a
below
average
beers
but
when
you
place
it
next
to
something
like
bud
or
coors
this
one
would
be
my
pick
and
they
make
a
hell
of
a
projectile
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
musty
and
dry
yet
slightly
sweet
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
smooth
and
musty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
it
has
a
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
isnt
real
flashy
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
quite
enjoyable
genesee
cream
ale
is
a
pale
straw
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
head
is
a
little
below
average
in
size
and
fairly
creamy
aroma
is
pretty
weak
just
a
whiff
of
clean
sweetness
the
taste
is
average
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
grain
is
enough
to
keep
genesee
cream
from
sucking
still
this
is
an
uninteresting
beer
this
beer
fares
well
as
a
relatively
cheap
around

a

beer
that
has

this

against

of
the
world
any

the

is

it
is
pretty

smell
was
husky

taste
followed
with

mouthfeel
was

and

carbonated
drinkability
is

to
low
on
a
hot
day
maybe
but
for
enjoyment
not
a
good
choice
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
gold
color
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
thick
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
longer
than
i
would
expect
the
aroma
is
pretty
nonexistent
perhaps
a
hint
of
sweet
grain
character
smells
a
bit
like
honeysuckle
perhaps
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mainly
this
is
a
simple
light
brew
that
cleanses
my
palate
with
its
simplistic
sweet
grain
flavors
definitely
not
my
bag
though
it
is
a
touch
more
fruity
than
a
stander
american
lager
and
it
really
does
remind
me
of
honey
for
some
reason
dont
buy
this
beer
unless
you
want
some
sturdy
bottles
for
your
homebrew
i
havent
broke
one
yet
update
ugg
dont
buy
this
in
cans
it
tastes
like
ass
sure
the
bottles
costs
a
little
more
but
for
3
something
for
a
sixer
it
is
still
a
great
deal
after
one
of
these
i
got
a
splitting
headache
however
i
decided
it
might
be
a
good
way
to
restore
my
silverware
and
lo
and
behold
it
took
off
all
the
crap
that
had
collected
on
my
antique
spoons
basically
this
is
draino
i
am
halfway
through
my
second
and
it
is
the
most
godawful
experience
of
my
life
its
just
a
sad
sad
beer
it
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
reasonable
amount
of
white
creamy
head
that
is
mostly
gone
after
the
first
sip
a
little
lacing
early
not
much
to
speak
of
aromawise
except
for
a
slight
hint
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
little
more
than
what
youd
expect
from
a
cheapy
a
little
sweeter
with
a
hint
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
finish
is
short
maybe
a
little
dms
but
still
not
bad
taking
style
into
account
im
giving
above
average
marks
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
at
any
price
not
the
worst
thing
i
have
tried
but
it
would
hurt
my
pride
less
to
beg
a
stranger
for
an
extra
three
dollars
to
get
something
good
than
to
buy
this
beer
again
drinkability
well
its
better
than
any
megabrew
beer
ive
ever
had
but
sadly
that
aint
saying
much
they
could
go
a
long
way
with
this
beer
if
they
tried
lets
hope
they
do
try
and
soon
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
would
definately
quench
a
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
to
try
last
week
after
joking
with
an
old
law
school
friend
who
said
he
loved
it
back
in
college
from
the
bottle
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
freezerchilled
pint
glass
surprisingly
the
head
held
on
for
a
few
minutes
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
flavor
no
malt
or
hops
to
speak
of
and
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
unpleasant
overall
not
fantastic
but
not
the
total
swill
that
others
seem
to
think
it
is
overallsolid
a
slighly
different
beverage
than
what
most
are
used
to
it
gets
the
job
done
i
tend
to
prefer
my
beers
much
less
sweet
but
this
beer
was
satisfiably
adaquete
3
bucks
a
sixpack
like
all
other
genny
products
this
is
the
highest
rated
from
me
thus
far
a
tasty
not
too
expensive
everyday
type
of
beer
for
the
bjcp
style
cream
ale
id
honestly
expected
some
even
lighter
and
more
attenuated
however
its
a
prime
commercial
example
so
it
has
to
be
a
4
75
or
so
out
of
5
but
its
better
without
the
vodka
ahh
an
old
classic
revisited
after
many
years
pours
an
average
white
head
over
clear
pale
golden
liquid
sweet
malty
nose
with
a
spicy
yeast
subtleness
to
it
above
average
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
of
this
nature
flavors
of
of
soft
maltiness
light
yet
effective
hop
bitterness
less
of
an
adjuncty
taste
than
you
would
be
led
to
believe
in
a
lowpriced
beer
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
sweet
flourish
for
the
price
you
just
cannot
beat
it
miles
ahead
of
pbr
in
my
opinion
a
great
hot
weather
quencher
this
beer
if
given
proper
attention
could
be
better
as
it
is
it
is
just
a
notch
above
in
my
book
many
massproduced
american
beers
simply
because
of
the
unique
creaminess
and
refreshing
taste
i
suspect
the
draft
version
trumps
the
bottle
and
the
bottle
trumps
the
can
which
i
can
only
remember
as
awful
yeah
drinkablilty
is
average
if
you
drink
it
ice
cold
and
you
wanna
quick
drunk
but
why
buy
this
stuff
if
you
can
find
genny
red
lager
its
the
same
price
and
a
far
better
tasting
beer
where
the
hollande
1620
i
had
just
prior
to
this
was
surprisingly
malty
and
had
a
bit
going
for
it
this
is
paler
than
the
pale
lager
the
head
more
fleeting
and
the
flavor
weaker
theres
no
hop
presence
in
the
nose
or
flavor
skunked
or
not
and
the
malt
only
shows
up
early
on
as
a
dry
paperlike
flavor
not
exciting
at
all
but
then
again
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
either
by
the
way
make
sure
you
dont
have
any
important
meetings
the
next
day
farting
is
a
side
effect
of
this
beer
the
head
is
small
white
very
noisy
and
dies
quickly
beer
is
clear
yellowgold
the
smell
is
sweet
corny
fairly
malty
front
is
tart
a
little
grainsy
middle
is
thin
some
corny
maltiness
finish
is
corny
and
slightly
bitter
turning
cloying
with
a
slight
chemical
flare
its
not
bad
a
sweet
corny
common
beer
the
flavor
is
the
strongpoint
here
but
i
really
do
not
want
to
overstate
that
as
some
kind
of
substantial
asset
average
taste
in
this
case
is
in
no
way
enough
to
overcome
the
beers
other
decidedly
subpar
characteristics
the
sum
of
the
parts
makes
it
drinakable
sure
but
i
wonder
to
myself
why
bother
nostalgia
true
i
had
more
than
my
share
in
the
early
80s
but
ill
claim
youth
as
an
excuse
for
such
illadvised
indulgences
some
things
are
best
left
in
the
past
and
this
is
one
of
them
drinkability

a
notch
above
the
typical
american
macro
swill
in
my
book
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
bet
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
not
drink
this
all
night
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
but
not
many
as
i
said
the
more
i
drank
the
worse
it
tasted
i
bought
this
one
on
one
of
my
all
to
often
whims
of
cheap
beers
i
am
always
spending
like
5
a
bottle
for
some
good
stuff
so
its
good
to
take
a
break
and
get
some
really
cheap
stuff
this
was
8
for
a
30
pack
and
that
was
cheap
enough
for
me
the
appearance
was
pretty
basic
nothing
fantastic
a
little
head
but
died
down
fast
the
color
was
of
the
basic
yellow
strawish
variety
the
smell
was
faint
but
you
could
definately
detect
some
cream
to
it
the
taste
was
similar
but
you
cold
taste
some
alcohol
to
it
at
5
1
the
mouthfeel
was
the
same
as
any
other
macrobeer
so
nothing
great
drinkability
i
think
so
gimmie
some
mo
pours
a
plae
fizzy
golden
yellow
with
a
healthy
sized
bright
white
head
leaving
trickled
lacing
not
bad
just
average
in
appearance
aroma
contains
sweet
aroma
from
the
combonation
of
malt
and
adjuncts
that
arent
to
off
pretty
unoffensive
smell
going
on
some
lemon
grass
tones
are
also
there
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
but
nothing
stands
out
here
taste
contains
a
rolling
sweet
flavor
not
bad
just
light
in
flavor
mild
hop
bitterness
just
a
touch
better
than
most
macros
thats
all
i
can
say
about
it
no
off
flavors
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
thin
light
in
body
no
impressive
features
within
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
not
bad
just
cant
see
myself
ever
craving
for
this
beer
wouldnt
pass
one
just
not
worth
seeking
out
light
gold
color
small
head

is
slightly
sweet
a
light
bodied
ale
smooth
lighter

taste
slightly

full

mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is

clean
aftertaste
is
malty
and
slightly

a
light
and
refreshing
beer
taste
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
corny
almost
starchy
dry
enough
not
to
make
me
want
more
odd
creamy
finish
like
an
aw
cream
soda
gone
wrong
coats
my
mouth
and
wont
let
go
no
more
please
crystal
clear
golden
body
with
the
thinnest
of
white
heads
no
discernible
lace
effect
from
the
thin
layer
of
white
plenty
of
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
sense
of
caramel
when
warmer
the
taste
is
purely
malt
with
the
lightest
of
hops
adding
a
small
degree
of
balance
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
on
the
palate
smooth
and
creamy
feel
with
little
crispness
this
beer
is
one
that
helped
me
survive
college
and
of
course
a
weekend
visit
up
there
got
my
old
college
buddy
feeling
nostalgic
for
it
it
has
got
more
flavor
to
it
than
most
of
the
other
beers
we
consumed
in
school
it
poured
a
typical
pale
yellow
color
and
formed
little
head
but
what
of
it
was
a
bubbly
white
with
no
lace
left
as
it
vanished
an
aroma
of
hops
and
grain
were
present
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
grain
the
finish
had
a
slight
creaminess
to
it
that
was
probably
what
helped
it
to
be
our
beer
of
choice
back
in
college
drinkabilitynotes
overall
this
is
a
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
quite
pleasing
in
the
summer
season
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
and
bubbly
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
with
little
else
present
light
in
body
with
a
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
taste
is
also
mostly
sweet
malts
with
only
a
trace
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
a
very
onedimensional
brew
to
me
genny
strikes
me
as
a
beer
that
cant
make
up
its
mind
whether
its
an
ale
or
lager
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
but
the
sweetness
can
put
off
a
lot
of
people
it
seems
to
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
burgers
off
the
grill
preferably
with
cheese
and
bacon
overall
i
would
put
this
towards
the
top
of
cheap
beers
there
are
plenty
of
truly
nasty
beers
this
isnt
one
of
them
truthfully
its
best
suited
for
battering
fish
but
if
this
were
in
a
cooler
of
free
beer
with
other
american
macros
id
take
it
taste
is
generic
mild
mannered
adjunctadditives
heavy
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
bread
dough
slightly
sweet
i
guess
you
can
describe
the
flavor
as
being
creamy
but
that
might
be
a
preconception
hard
to
say
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
rather
low
i
think
it
helps
the
beer
a
lot
enough
already
with
fizzy
soda
like
carbonation
one
of
the
best
super
cheap
beers
highly
carbonated
goldamber
pour
settles
down
quickly
from
an
explove
frothy
head
to
a
coating
deflated
lace
smells
lightly
of
spice
and
lime
alcohol
alcohol
alcohol
i
wonder
its
leaded
the
melodramatic
wet
dog
flavor
stays
consistant
with
a
musky
crisp
taste
and
a
sandy
smarmy
finish
quite
a
bang
for
your
buck
another
beer
headed
to
the
dead
beer
file
so
one
last
review
before
its
ultimate
demise
at
least
for
me
the
pour
a
bright
gold
color
the
head
average
and
bright
white
as
it
decays
leaves
behind
a
thin
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
malt
sweet
and
fresh
sweet
malt
start
the
top
quite
thin
the
finish
as
weak
as
water
mild
carbonation
the
hops
scarce
aftertaste
dry
personally
a
total
loss
it
does
beat
dying
of
thirst
but
just
barely
its
better
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
much
smoother
and
creamier
and
it
has
a
lot
more
flavor
the
can
is
lacking
all
the
qualities
that
make
it
a
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
it
is
still
decent
and
you
can
throw
em
back
but
it
is
not
anything
special
bottom
line
definitely
a
better
alternative
than
the
standards
especially
on
draught
a
reliable
would
i
say
this
beer
is
wonderful
but
it
offers
far
more
character
than
the
basic
genesee
beer
it
finishes
slightly
sticky
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
without
any
real
dryness
but
thin
head
this
dissapated
quickly
this
was
highly
carbonated
and
a
rich
gold
color
hop
nose
was
good

overall

abv
unique
cream
style
ale
with
a
light
lager
taste
the
immediate
taste
is
reminiscent
of
has
cream
beer
taste
with
a
slight
compliment
of
lemon
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
below
average
and
the
smell
is
undesirable
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
go
outof
my
way
to
find
bottle
says
malt
beverage
with
natural
flavors
added
according
to
their
website
there
is
no
mention
of
fruit
or
spices
or
anything
other
than
grains
hops
water
and
yeast
involved
no
freshness
dating
either
pours
to
a
thin

lasting

with

is

almost

is
grainy
and
biscuity
with
a
slight

tinge
to
it
flavor
is
bland
and
weak
but
pleasant
enough
just
merely
better
than
a
light
macro
lager
finishes
super
dry
and
slightly
parching
mouthfeel
is
soso
overall
i
would
classify
this
beer
as
a
very
weak
but
drinkable
summer
lawnmower
brew
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
boring
light
ale
and
to
be
honest
id
be
very
pleased
to
homebrew
something
this
light
and
refreshing
and
technically
pure
honestly
id
take
a
schlafly
kolsch
or
boulevard
wheat
over
this
in
half
a
heartbeat
though
o
this
beer
has
a
great
summer
sessionable
beer
that
has
lots
of
nice
soft
flavors
that
support
the
lagered
noble
hops
flavor
that
is
dominant
easy
drinking
beer
that
maintains
some
flavor
would
go
down
nicely
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
doing
some
yardwork
very
faint
toastiness
from
the
malt
also
get
flavors
of
unmalted
barley
and
some
lactose
theres
some
adjuncty
tasting
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
palate
is
smooth
but
watery
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
uncomplicated
tail
or
no
i
could
never
get
my
kites
to
fly
all
that
long
man
i
had
a
kinda
sad
childhood
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
sweet
oats
not
unlike
a
sweetened
version
of
cheerios
or
some
other
cereal
and
a
hint
of
grass
the
taste
basically
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
vague
fruitiness
that
detracts
from
the
sweet
grainy
notes
that
have
been
forced
into
the
background
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
drying
finish
overall
a
generally
solid
beer
but
one
whose
surprise
and
oddball
fruitiness
keeps
it
from
achieving
anything
close
to
greatness

it

i
cant
put
a

on
a

one
for
this

but
seems
to
be
a
hot
item
in
st

o
im
no
cream
ale
expert
but
this
seems
to
be
a
very
representative
entry
for
the
style
just
a
little
watery
but
you
get
all
the
drinkability
of
a
bmc
without
the
awful
flavor
a
great
summer
lawnmower
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
cream
ale
it
is
better
than
most
cream
ales
that
ive
tried
o
nice
inoffensive
summer
ale
that
goes
down
easy
goes
best
with
bbq
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
ofallon
lineup
im
not
as
passionate
about
this
as
i
am
their
hemp
hop
rye
or
their
black
hemp
beers
still
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
thats
cheap
on
the
wallet
is
hard
to
pass
up
overall
a
nice
new
addition
to
the
ofallon
lineup
this
summer
ale
would
be
perfect
at
any
time
though
especially
during
the
warmer
months
would
pair
nicely
with
a
garlic
y

i
typically

in

one
it
works
good
beer
very
yeasty
in
a
good
way
extremely
light
and
refreshing
with
the
beer
closing
its
taste
a

belgian
style
cream
ale
finds
sure
favor
with
those
seeking
more
than
the
bland
industrial
brewers
offering
that
scour
the
market
lacking
much
flavor
kind
of
blah
overall
drinkability
this
one
throws
me
for
how
to
characterize
it
it
has
some
definite
belgian
style
flavor
notes
but
has
some
aspects
of
a
belgian
wit
and
im
not
sure
if
it
has
any
real
aspects
of
a
cream
ale
or
not
maybe
in
regard
to
the
mouthfeel
so
since
it
defies
easy
characterization
ill
just
say
that
as
a
beer
its
easily
drinkable
went
well
with
pork
tacos
and
salad
and
flavorful
enough
that
i
think
it
would
pair
with
a
wide
range
of
food
overall
its
a
definitely
above
average
beer
but
its
hard
to
rate
per
a
style
because
its
a
hybrid
not
a
review
please
ignore
i
could
see
a
few
tickers
liking
the
mixed
4
pack
from
camerons
but
i
doubt
id
buy
a
second
i
would
buy
a
fresh
bomber
of
their
ryepa
again
but
thats
about
it
o
ok
smooth
light
lager
like
not
wowing
me
got
it
in
a
camerons
mixed
pack
according
to
the
companys
web
site
cca
was
a
gold
medal
winner
at
the
canadian
brewing
awards
i
am
hoping
to
try
the
beer
again
as
i
may
of
had
an
off
batch
camerons
has
award
winning
beers
overall
a
bit
better
than
i
had
remembered
it
but
definitely
nothing
outstanding
holds
its
own
with
some
of
ontarios
other
brewers
in
the
style
but
not
anything
i
would
rush
out
again
the
main
purpose
behind
trying
the
pack
was
to
get
a
small
taste
of
the
rye
pale
ale
and
the
deviator
doppelbock
anyway
but
this
will
help
quaff
my
thirst
for
the
afternoon

to
a
very
light
bitterness
in
its
short
finish
i
think
this
tastes
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
lightbodied
with
an
abundance
of
soft
finely
textured
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
something
i
care
to
return
to
final
grade
3
35
a
b
m
there
is
a
short
little
bitter
ending
the
start
is
nice
but
also
minimal
not
as
intense
as
expected
od
not
for
me
something
just
gives
off
too
much
of
a
honey
note
and
takes
over
any
other
element
that
could
power
through
it
could
be
better
ho
hum
not
much
going
on
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
point
a
slighter
better
version
of
the
sleemans
cream
ale
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
true
cream
ale
not
the
mild
such
is
found
in
bc
fairly
boring
beer
in
that
it
really
never
excites
the
slight
apple
juice
flavour
is
there
on
the
finish
not
really
worth
buying
overall
personally
i
didnt
really
like
this
one
i
mean
its
definitely
not
a
drain
pour
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
higher
rated
american
craft
but
it
really
tastes
like
an
adjunct
macro
not
much
aromas
going
on
and
the
tastes
really
match
the
smell
as
well
just
a
lot
of
bready
malts
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
would
not
pick
this
one
up
again
and
probably
wouldnt
have
if
not
for
the
ocb
discovery
pack
another
very
drinkable
beer
from
camerons
though
maybe
a
bit
too
syrupy
this
one
plays
it
safe
and
would
go
over
well
in
many
casual
settings
camerons
seems
to
excel
at
making
beers
that
are
equal
parts
really
boring
and
very
drinkable
i
had
the
lager
right
before
this
and
i
found
the
experience
to
be
eerily
similar
overall
i
had
no
issues
with
this
beer
seems
like
a
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
and
although
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
im
happy
that
i
gave
it
a
try
it
was
better
than
the
muskoka
cream
ale
for
sure
ill
still
review
them
just
in
case
i
find
one
i
like
but
im
not
a
fan
of
cream
ales
and
this
one
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
this
is
so
bland
sweet
and
with
a
strange
adjunct
flavor
that
really
throws
the
whole
off
wont
get
again
dwell
there
is
nothing
controversial
here
why
couldnt
you
have
a
ton
of
these
it
does
have
a
creamy
mouthfeel
but
that
tomatoish
aroma
is
present
in
the
taste
finishes
creamy
and
a
bit
bitter
but
overall
not
a
winner
pours
a
pale
orange
colour
with
almost
no
headlacing
smells
of
strong
bready
malt
without
any
real
hop
aroma
flavour
is
quite
muted
some
sweetness
nothing
is
off
about
the
flavour
but
it
is
quite
mild
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
but
it
isnt
flat
pretty
much
on
style
for
a
cream
ale
but
a
pretty
uninteresting
one
not
a
fan
final
thoughts
camerons
seems
to
establish
itself
as
a
gateway
to
craft
beer
brewery
its
offerings
seem
to
be
geared
towards
macro
drinkers
who
want
something
different
both
this
offer
and
their
lager
are
superior
to
their
macro
counterparts
but
not
so
off
the
beaten
path
as
to
scare
away
nonbas
for
the
most
part
its
good
beer
for
the
average
person
although
not
your
average
ba
d
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
memorable
one
as
much
as
i
like
this
brewerys
cream
ale
and
i
really
really
do
i
dont
know
what
sense
it
makes
to
produce
both
this
and
their
lager
given
the
beers
are
so
similar
in
style
not
to
mention
they
only
release
4
offerings
in
total
they
obviously
do
what
they
do
well
but
id
like
to
see
this
brewer
put
his
talents
towards
tackling
a
wider
ranger
of
styles
surprisingly
decent
by
no
means
is
this
something
id
go
out
and
buy
again
i
only
got
it
because
i
needed
some
of
the
bottles
for
a
trade
but
it
has
made
me
reassess
my
stance
on
cream
ales
a
bit
and
recognise
that
theres
some
potential
there
camerons
cream
ale
went
down
very
easily
and
while
its
flavour
is
at
the
simpler
end
of
the
spectrum
it
seems
wellsuited
as
a
light
summer
quaff
this
is
a
pretty
typical
cream
ale
not
outstanding
but
true
to
the
style
if
you
like
cream
ales
give
it
a
try
similar
to
the
blonde
ale
and
california
common
the
cream
ale
falls
somewhere
in
between
a
lager
and
an
ale
the
genre
is
not
well
regarded
by
craft
drinkers
most
likely
because
it
lacks
bold
inyourface
flavours
for
the
style
though
this
beer
is
tasty
and
sessionable
and
thats
all
it
really
needs
to
be
a
moderately
aboveaverage
cream
ale
mostly
unmemorable
and
inoffensive
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
procure
but
adequate
if
there
are
no
better
options
read
swanky
expenseaccount
hotel
bar
and
what
the
hell
does
being
dimensional
mean
existent
here
right
now
pfft
d
quite
drinkable
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
nothing
too
special
but
a
nice
patio
beer
a
very
insipid
beer
along
the
lines
of
a
bmc
product
in
the
flavor
department
final
statement
better
than
the
dark
ale
bland
and
boring
and
really
not
much
better
than
some
of
the
better
macro
lagers
out
there
pale
yellow
with
a
small
fizzy
head
very
low
hop
presence
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavour
flavour
in
general
is
mild
bordering
on
weak
but
with
no
detectable
adjuncts
or
off
flavours
improves
slightly
at
warmer
temperatures
overcarbonated
notes
special
thanks
to
biegaman
for
the
sample
drinkability
is
ok
the
smell
is
throwing
me
off
but
the
taste
is
ok
overall
not
too
bad
but
not
too
great
either
3
5s
across
the
board
for
a
fairly
impressive
brew
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
cream
ale
and
you
havent
tried
camerons
you
should
go
out
now
and
do
so
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
still
worth
a
try
as
its
a
great
beer
in
its
own
right
regardless
of
style
this
poured
a
yelloworange
with
a
little
lacing
smell
is
unique
vegetable
aromas
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
slightly
vegetable
like
not
overly
carbonated
pretty
smooth
better
than
some
other
cream
ales
ive
had
in
the
past
this
beer
is
ok
id
have
another
if
offered
very
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
reduced
quickly
soft
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
faint
hops
mild
sweetness
and
the
low
bitterness
comes
out
a
bit
more
towards
the
end
theres
also
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
flavour
in
the
finish
low
carbonation
light
body
offdry
finish
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
wrong
with
the
beer
yet
nothing
really
interesting
either
i
found
this
to
be
to
close
in
flavours
to
the
macros
and
cannot
say
i
found
it
to
be
up
to
standard
for
a
cream
ale
i
do
prefer
sleemans
version
of
cream
ale
as
it
is
much
more
characterful
and
quenching
on
a
hot
day

dry
slight

my

some

too
i
must
have
gotten
a
badly
handled
case
from
the
lcbo
i
should
have
guessed
seeing
how
it
was
unchilled
on
the
shelf
looked
a
tad
too
hazey
and
the
cap
although
ample
didnt
stay
as
long
as
the
ones
i
had
on
tap
aroma
was
citrus
musty
earthy
with
some
malt
sweetness
sweet
malt
balanced
well
against
a
lemongrass
like
hopping
but
there
was
a
very
annoying
soapy
taste
that
played
out
as
a
sour
yeasty
taste
in
the
finish
i
think
i
got
some
spoiled
beer
will
rerate
at
a
later
date
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
whose
style
has
become
popularized
through
creemore
flagship
ok
pour
and
foam
was
a
bit
sweet
no
outstanding
flavour
ok
on
the
tongue
found
it
dried
the
mouth
and
felt
was
bits
of
yeast
aftertaste
fine
for
a
summer
day
a
cut
above
national
brands
taste
is
very
nice
almost
a
bittersweet
with
a
very
slight
lingering
moment
i
would
definetely
recomend
this
cream
ale
just
another
big
box
beer
with
0
diverse
taste
overall
a
small
step
up
from
domestic
lagers
but
only
marginally
better
than
the
likes
of
canadian
and
blue
which
is
pretty
much
what
this
beer
is
being
targeted
towards
pass
final
grade
3
24
a
c
sleeman
cream
ale
is
a
boring
utilitarian
macro
ale
i
will
drink
this
again
at
some
point
but
its
never
going
to
be
something
i
consume
regularly
im
starting
to
appreciate
this
one
more
in
my
old
age
i
used
to
be
a
honey
brown
guy
but
this
one
is
far
less
cloyingly
sweet
with
a
cleaner
flavour
than
the
original
draught
a
passable
macro
at
a
decent
price
point
i
like
to
stock
up
on
cans
of
this
when
it
goes
on
sale
as
its
something
mundane
that
i
can
leave
in
the
fridge
and
offer
to
visitors
that
prefer
the
regular
stuff
bottled
from
a
sleeman
mix
pack
5
a
passable
patiomacro
beer
and
the
price
is
right
pale
clear
w
a
white
head
aroma
is
kind
of
corny
vegetablelike
has
a
light
sweetness
light
body
creamy
average
carbonation
inoffensive
but
nothing
worthy
of
real
praise
overall
i
would
take
the
sleeman
silvercreek
over
this
at
least
that
was
refreshing
this
one
just
has
too
much
skunkiness
aka
she
man
cream
ale
aftertaste
is
not
surprisingly
a
little
more
bitter
but
still
very
refreshing
like
all
the
sleeman
beers
are
this
ranks
a
little
higher
than
the
original
sleeman
but
its
a
bit
of
a
downgrade
because
this
is
a
pretty
poor
cream
ale
but
a
good
pale
lager
they
should
just
market
it
as
that
o
pass
go
collect
and
move
on
nothing
worthy
here
from
a
flavour
profile
but
its
an
easy
drinking
macro
brew
thats
disguised
as
a
craft
ale
dont
be
fooled
owhat
i
kind
of
expected
not
a
great
cream
ale
but
hit
the
main
aspects
just
dont
burp
youll
get
than
nasty
funk
again
it
is
what
it
is
pedestrian
for
the
beer
geek
perhaps
but
comparable
to
the
slew
of
retro
lagers
that
are
available
now
within
the
american
cream
ale
style
this
one
ranks
high
we
envision
a
heaping
plate
of
chili
cheese
nachos
with
fried
jalapeño
ringsor
just
a
few
cold
ones
on
a
hot
summer
day
wow
cream
ale
64
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
something
that
would
totally
amaze
me
hahahahahaha
was
i
mistaken
honest
guys
this
is
no
rare
beer
by
any
means
it
excels
in
nothing
except
5
alcohol
i
just
got
back
from
panama
and
drank
every
panamanian
beer
i
could
and
would
rate
any
of
them
better
than
this
canadian
brew
sorry
if
the
truth
hurts
but
thats
the
way
it
is
gold
color
with
a
wispy
head
and
light
prickle
the
nose
is
like
malted
snow
my
wife
described
it
as
a
scent
that
reminded
her
of
the
vfw
on
bingo
night
creamy
attack
and
a
bold
flavor
of
cream
it
is
a
very
macrobrewesque
offering
except
that
perhaps
it
is
a
little
bit
more
bold
than
many
macrobrews
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
that
would
do
much
better
on
a
hot
day
than
any
other
time
nothing
spectacular
but
a
decent
session
beer
that
i
certainly
would
not
turn
away
drinkability
better
than
the
standard
mass
produced
beer
but
not
something
that
needs
to
be
drank
whenever
possible
this
beer
really
didnt
have
much
greatness
about
it
i
liked
it
the
least
of
all
in
the
mix
pack
mostly
bland
dark
malt
tones
nothing

in

a

beer
that
costs

a
six
pack
i
know
im
sounding
like
a
broken
record
with
this
one
but
i
would
rather
have
an
mgd
which
i
consider
having
superior
carbonation
and
at
least
tastes
and
smells
like
a
weak
pilsner
not
a
glass
of
white
wine
i
wont
spill
it
out
oh
no
since
i
could
use
it
to
wash
dishes
water
the
plants
or
at
the
very
least
its
like
5
abv
water
which
almost
sounds
like
fun
almost
the
feel
didnt
seem
to
match
the
taste
well
though
i
have
no
complaints
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
thick

smell
was
light
but
had
a
distinct
dustiness
to
it
rather
unflattering
taste
was
completely
unremarkable
nothing
there
really
left
a
slight
coat
in
my
mouth
i
felt
there
really
wasnt
anything
exciting
about
it
at
all
not
terrible
just
boring
the
mouthfeel
finishes
in
sort
of
the
same
way
as
a
cream
soda
which
is
sort
of
expected
but
its
thin
watery
and
bubbly
i
think
this
is
the
beer
stone
had
in

for
its
fizzy
yellow
beer
is
for
wussies
slogan
do
yourself
a
favor
and
skip

one

this
product
is
a
deception
cause
its
the

poured
a
12oz
bottle
into

chimay
chalice
this
is
a
really

not
that
wow
interesting
but
that
where
is
everything
interesting
there
is
barley
an
aroma
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
honestly
the
most
memorable
thing
is
the
carbonation
quite
a
bit
of
it
it
kind
of
tasted
like
a
toned
down
version
of
beer
mixed
with
alka

wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
not
too
good
of
smell
to
it
nothing
strong
just
a
regular

the
taste
wasnt
stong
to
it
and
was
slightly

i

it
was
a

months
past

5
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
has
that
green
apple
type
smell
which
is
quite
prominent
the
flavor
also
has
that
same
green
apple
thing
its
quite
grainy
with
a
little
touch
of
bitterness
toward
the
end
drinkability
worth
a
try
its
a
lot
like
a
light
lager
not
bad
overall
well
i
guess
ice
cold
its
not
to
badprobably
one
of
the
better
sleemans
its
worth
a
try
now
its
merely
okay
but
its
a
big
world
out
there
this
beer
was
not
good
every
time
i
cross
the
border
i
try
and
pick
up
a
taster
just
out
of
curiosity
i
should
quit
cause
theyve
been
nearly
overwhelmingly
bad
this
is
a
light
yellow
beer
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissolves
really
fast
nose
is
weak
mostly
grain
and
some
sweet
malt
flavor
is
honey
malt
and
candy
theres
nearly
no
hop
character
body
is
thin
i
guess
this
ones
alright
for
a
thin
quickly
poundable
beer
but
for
something
to
taste
look
elsewhere
i
have
to
confess
that
my
arm
was
twisted
when
i
drank
this
ale
i
was
offered
a
choice
between
heineken
molson
and
sleeman
sleeman
sounded
like
the
best
choice
at
the
time
but
after
drinking
it
i
think
i
should
have
chosen
molson
it
poured
in
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
lots
of
creamy
foam
and
smelling
sour
mixed
with
crackers
peaches
and
some
lemon
so
far
so
good
but
the
taste
had
a
weird
syrupy
sweetness
that
did
not
mix
well
with
the
strong
bread
note
on
top
of
that
i
found
it
to
be
watery
its
not
an
ale
that
i
can
recommend
d
this
isnt
bad
it
seems
to
be
fairly
standard
for
the
style
feel
is
watery
and
yet
a
bit
creamy
and
bubbly
in
the
background
overall
its
just
dully
really
bland
and
watery
nearly
flavorless
very
little
distinguishes
it
from
the
most
mediocre
of
american
macros
to
be
honest
i
didnt
expect
much
from
sleeman
cream
ale
64
i
can
hardly
be
blamed
though
since
these
guys
have
burned
me
in
the
past
the
brewerys
website
states
that
the
intention
was
to
combine
the
refreshing
taste
of
a
german
lager
with
the
distinctive
taste
of
an
english
ale
mission
accomplished
this
is
a
surprisingly
worthy
warm
weather
beer
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
colour
so
the
bottle
isnt
hiding
anything
with
a
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
thick
and
hoppy
maybe
too
hoppy
this
beer
has
way
too
much
carbonation
and
is
harsh
on
the
cheeks
the
taste
is
a
mishmash
of
varying
degrees
slightly
malty
slightly
grassy
slightly
awful
overall
the
properties
of
this
beer
are
rather
muted
and
i
think
the
flavor
is
too
sweet
although
i
will
say
it
was
very
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
final
statement
first
time
i
had
this
in
cans
the
bottles
are
better
because
leaving
them
in
the
clear
bottles
makes
you
feel
like
youre
drinking
something
refreshing
when
on
a
deck
in
the
summer
this
beer
is
my
favourite
sleeman
brew
because
its
easy
drinking
slightly
better
than
most
macros
and
a
crowd
pleaser
not
craft
but
not
too
bad
very
lean
tolerant
quenching
watered
down
sure
but
there
is
flavor
here
d
really
boring
but
i
guess
it
could
be
worse
i
should
get
my
mom
to
drink
better
beer
i
will
relax
and
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
however
i
cant
see
myself
pitching
another
7
50
towards
our
northern
neighbor
just
to
get
a
beer
that
has
a
cool
bottle
and
5
alcohol
sorry
received
a
six
pack
of
bottles
through
my
beer
club
poured
a
pale
amber
without
much
of
a
lasting
head
aroma
and
flavor
were
average
at
best
feels
like
a
light
lager
with
little
finish
this
is
not
an
impressive
ale
and
not
one
id
purchase
on
my
own
ended
up
giving
two
of
them
away
had
this
at
the
between
the
bluffs
beer
fest
served
with
a
little
head
and
less
lace
beery
bittersweet
aroma
with
traces
of
hops
and
malt
and
definite
corn
yellow
color
bland
but
thirst
quenching
so
some
hop
a
little
body
well
carbonated
clean
easy
drinking
slightly
bitter
finish
d
very
easy
to
drink
creamy
but
not
too
sweet
good
beer
to
travel
with
drinkable
but
forgettable
certainly
not
worth
the
import
price
if
i
were
in
canada
where
it
is
presumably
cheaper
it
could
pass
as
a
mindless
session
brew
color
is
pure
gold
aroma
is
sickly
sweet
but
its
not
bad
if
that
makes
any
sense
flavor
is
of
sweet
bread
with
hints
of
caramel
fair
amount
of
adjuncts
lighten
the
body
and
round
out
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
round
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
however
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
with
any
amount
of
hops
move
on
this
is
nearing
on
a
macrobrew
but
still
quality
for
now
stay
true
sleemans
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
leaves
a
small
trail
of
lace
behind
not
picking
up
much
while
smelling
seems
very
light
and
maybe
a
little
metallic
taste
is
light
to
moderate
and
there
is
definitely
that
metallic
hint
there
feels
bubbly
and
tingly
with
some
weight
to
it
average
beer
definitely
not
the
best
cream
ale
ive
had
in
my
opinion
its
just
an
average
to
above
average
beer
d
pretty
good
this
isnt
really
anything
special
but
its
really
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
guess
there
must
be
something
good
about
this
beer
and
its
the
mouthfeel
right
balance
of
carbonation
and
body
making
it
fairly
drinkable
if
you
dont
want
to
have
to
think
about
your
beer
i
must
stress
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
is
badunpleasant
per
se
however
im
having
difficulty
coming
up
with
anything
good
either
one
and
done
a
bottle
of
this
mysteriously
showed
up
in
my
beer
fridge
pours
a
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
or
lacing
smell
is
like
apple
cider
no
skunkiness
detected
the
apple
cider
follows
through
with
the
flavor
as
well
except
it
has
a
sour
note
to
it
tastes
more
like
a
sour
hard
cider
though
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
sails
in
on
the
tail
not
something
i
would
buy
in
the
future
in
fact
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
the
last
inch
or
so
was
a
drain
pour
drinkabilty
not
impressed
with
this
there
are
many
better
cream
ales
most
likely
served
at
your
local
brewpub
im
not
sure
what
the
difference
between
sleeman
cream
ale
and
sleeman
cream
ale
64
is
except
that
one
is
in
the
standard
sleeman
clear
bottle
and
the
other
is
in
brown
glass
it
pours
the
expected
clear
golden
body
and
creamy
white
head
retention
and
lacing
are
average
aroma
is
average
the
taste
is
average
in
fact
nothing
seems
to
stand
out
at
all
about
this
beer
it
has
a
very
generic
malt
and
hop
flavor
that
could
just
as
well
be
almost
any
americanstyle
lager
there
is
an
edge
to
it
however
and
perhaps
thats
because
its
an
ale
and
if
it
is
its
one
really
clean
ale
for
sure
there
is
more
bitterness
to
it
ill
give
it
that
but
its
still
below
pilsner
levels
i
guess
it
does
have
some
drinkability
to
it
though
if
you
look
at
it
as
being
unoffensive
and
quaffable
still
its
kind
of
boring
and
overall
unremarkable
the
pour
was
a
clear
golden
with
a
bright
white
foamy
head
the
settles
to
a
respectable
lace
aroma
was
to
be
expected
with
light
malt
corn
flavor
was
also
expected
with
the
same
light
malt
and
corn
however
i
was
also
picking
up
some
sweet
almost
fruity
flavors
that
i
didnt
exactly
know
what
to
make
of
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
average
for
this
style
overall
i
would
go
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
brew
but
it
is
worth
a
try
to
further
science
i
would
like
help
with
iding
the
sweet
flavors
ive
never
seen
this
brewery
at
the
store
i
work
at
total
wine
in
fort
myers
fl
but
i
was
certainly
up
for
trying
something
different
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
cocacola
glass
and
noted
its
golden
color
the
smell
is
mildly
of
strawberries
it
has
sort
of
a
creamy
low
carbonation
fruity
taste
that
finishes
ever
so
slightly
bitter
i
purchased
a
sample
pack
that
included
the
ipa
porter
and
pale
ale
which
i
all
have
yet
to
try
and
review
if
you
ever
come
across
this
beer
its
worth
a
taste
all
of
the
sleemans
beers
that
i
have
tried
are
just
the
same
watered
down
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
good
any
time
especially
on
a
hot
day
im
not
much
on
the
style
but
this
one
seems
like
a
good
representation
i
would
probably
have
it
again
d
awful
i
need
a
bud
or
corona
or
something
to
chase
this
one
yuck
d
sure
why
not
pleasantly
surprised
for
a
cream
ale
basically
i
dont
expect
much
from
the
style
so
compared
to
expectations
this
was
excellent
certainly
the
best
cream
ale
ive
had
taste
was
absolutely
not
creamy
i
dont
know
where
this
name
came
from
it
is
just
a
normal
blond
beer
and
not
even
a
very
good
one
it
is
mild
hoppy
and
has
some
malt
in
there
if
it
would
be
catagorized
as
a
blond
i
would
rate
it
higher
too
bad
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
frankly
i
dont
like
it
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
this
probably
wouldnt
be
bad
lawnmower
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
think
i
will
try
a
different
beer
next
time
originally
reviewed
april
9
2005
on
tap
at
the
gitchee
gumee
brewfest
2005
wow
this
is
one
of
the
most
putrid
beers
ive
ever
had
it
stinks
of
bad
fruit
and
must
tastes
bland
and
skunky
even
on
tap
extremely
watery
and
almost
painful
to
drink
one
of
the
four
selections
in
the
sleeman
selections
12
pack
distinctive
clear
sleeman
bottle
red
neck
label
pours
a
clear
orangeyellow
color
nice
creamy
white
head
although
it
is
a
fairly
short
stack
of
foam
there
is
good
stability
and
nice
lace
the
smell
is
grainy
with
a
bit
of
earthy
floral
grass
in
it
the
flavor
has
some
sweetness
there
is
the
typical
grains
and
a
slight
touch
of
skunk
from
the
clear
bottle
a
tiny
hint
of
metallic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
still
kind
of
thin
and
watery
good
but
not
great
all
sleeman
products
are
slightly
better
than
molsonlabatt
offerings
overall
score
is
still
not
recommended
there
are
lots
of
better
cream
ales
out
there
well
if
nothing
else
this
sure
as
heck
is
a
cream
ale
the
body
is
great
too
bad
its
too
darn
sweet
to
kick
back
more
than
one
at
a
time
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
my
drinking
buddy
that
i
taste
coffee
and
chocolate
in
every
dark
brew
and
high
alcohol
aftertaste
and
sour
squid
and
balsamic
vingear
or
some
such
foreign
thing
to
beer
in
every
thing
we
drink
i
guess
this
might
be
true
but
i
could
have
sworn
that
with
this
beer
i
tasted
the
grapeygrapeygrape
of
grolsch
in
here
and
something
akin
to
michelob
without
the
grimy
feel
of
a
lobotomy
my
heart
said
that
a
cream
ale
having
never
tasted
one
would
taste
like
a
milkshake
or
as
my
friend
suggested
a
creme
soda
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
typical
massproduced
beer
but
minus
the
playing
deck
of
cards
looking
label
and
a
heart
as
small
as
it
is
that
at
least
tries
to
sing
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
essentially
a
much
smoother
genny
cream
ale
this
one
is
drinkable
but
again
not
worth
picking
up
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
and
adjunct
scent
that
is
a
bit
sweet
along
with
a
dry
aroma
the
taste
is
average
also
it
has
a
very
dry
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
adjuncts
its
a
bit
sweet
on
the
way
down
but
finishes
dry
and
musty
the
mouthfeel
is
terrible
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
loads
of
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
for
the
scrap
heap
it
needs
more
malt
content
and
a
little
less
carbonation
pours
yellow
to
light
gold
sweet
corn
rice
smells
mix
with
a
sour
smell
taste
is
starchy
sweetness
with
a
little
skunkiness
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
at
the
finish
as
it
warms
the
starchy
sweetness
is
more
pronounced
very
little
body
to
speak
of
totally
clear
yellow
with
an
awfull
head
smells
of
grains
and
minerals
taste
is
mostly
just
crappy
malts
with
a
hint
of
sourness
and
minerals
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
just
foamy
water
overall
i
am
dissapointed
mostly
because
i
had
high
hopes
it
is
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
mouthfeel
very
light
for
any
so
called
ale
ive
had
this
was
not
a
good
intro
into
cream
ales
but
ill
continue
to
try
still
it
drinks
fairly
easily
and
could
appeal
to
some
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
a
minimum
white
soapy
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
funky
through
that
you
get
hints
of
rye
and
grain
small
amount
of
lemon
the
taste
is
light
and
smooth
it
is
light
refreshing
i
expected
more
if
to
pair
with
food
i
found
it
nice
with
a
good
chicken
caesar
salad
clean
and
drinkable
in
hot
sticky
summer
heat
not
a
beer
ill
look
for
in
twelve
packs
in
the
future
methinks
still
the
taste
partially
redeems
this
beer
although
its
still
resides
in
ordinary
city
another
in
the
series
of
beers
brewed
from
a
nearly
forgotten
little
black
book
of
preprohibition
family
recipies
do
you
sense
my
skepticism
without
doing
a
sidebyside
i
couldnt
be
sure
but
i
really
dont
know
that
this
is
much
different
if
any
from
the
regular
production
cream
ale
a
bit
tinny
and
tired
with
poorly
melded
flavors
the
end
result
is
both
harsh
and
boring
btw
im
not
sure
what
the
difference
is
between
this
being
the
cream
ale
64
and
the
regular
cream
ale

edit
tried
one
of
these
again
recently
thanx
to
my
friend
shawn
for
the
brew
and
i
think
it
was
definitely
better
still
not
great
but
not
as
harsh
as
in
the
past
mild
and
slightly
musty
aroma
of
malt
with
light
hops
pours
a
clear
bubbly
light
gold
with
a
small
diminishing
offwhite
head
flavor
is
decent
creamy
and
smooth
it
starts
off
mild
and
bland
and
ends
with
a
faint
hop
or
bitter
note
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
but
theres
nothing
particularly
good
about
it
either
slightly
above
average
at
best
pours
amber
clear
with
some
precipitating
carbonation
large
foamy
white
head
that
lingers
is
unfortunately
the
best
part
of
this
beer
unimpressive
nose
of
light
hops
with
some
citrus
typical
of
a
macro
lager
flavor
is
not
bad
but
not
good
mild
malts
and
hops
predominate
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
fairly
bubbly
but
anything
but
creamy

above
average
drinkability
this
is
a
typical
lawn
mowing
beer
marginally
better
than
your
typical
macro
lager
smooth
rich
and
creamy
very
nice
drinkable
beer
worth
a
try
dont
let
it
get
warm
it
definitely
needs
to
stay
cold
a
solid
beer
to
begin
a
session
looks
medium
straw
in
color
and
pours
a
white
cap
of
loose
bubbles
that
hold
for
a
little
while
smells
modestly
sweet
and
vegetable
like
faint
yeastiness
and
earthyness
tastes
lightly
sweet
and
corn
like
follows
up
with
a
powdery
sweetness
like
powdered
sugar
feels
slightly
slick
and
buttery
to
the
palate
light
body
that
remains
consistent
through
the
finishes
finishes
also
crisp
and
fresh
clear
light
golden
amber
thin
offwhite
lace
of
head
sweet
grainy
malt
aroma
some
floral
hops
as
well
sweet
maltiness
almost
like
marshmallows
dominates
the
flavour
mild
bitterness
and
medium
length
sweet
finish
slightly
creamy
texture
one
of
sleemans
better
offerings
and
a
good
beer
to
transition
friends
away
from
industrial
lagers
this
one
is
very
similar
to
little
kings
cream
ale
which
i
always
thought
was
a
made
up
style
apparently
its
not
it
is
very
grainy
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
has
the
same
oily
mouthfeel
as
the
aforementioned
cream
ale
along
with
the
creamy
aftertaste
there
are
no
fireworks
here
and
it
is
not
incredibly
drinkable
either
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
my
choices
were
extremely
limited
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
very
little
lace
aroma
was
a
bit
floral
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
second
sleeman
product
i
have
noticed
this
taste
was
a
sweet
front
and
a
fair
amount
of
hops
in
the
finish
nothing
terrible
in
fact
rather
good
mouthfeel
was
a
little
creamy
duh
and
the
abv
was
well
hidden
in
the
taste
this
is
a
good
swilling
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
word
sleeman
just
sounds
dirty
for
some
reason
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
was
gone
quickly
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
skunky
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
lightbodied
and
kind
of
fizzy
with
a
nondescript
flavor
bland
hops
and
vague
sweetness
here
and
there
is
about
it
the
finish
is
clean
bubbly
and
faintly
sweet
doesnt
do
much
for
me
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
pure
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
clean
aroma
with
a
slight
sweet
malt
and
floral
hop
and
mild
bready
yeast
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
is
also
clean
no
skunk
even
with
the
clear
bottle
there
is
a
nice
malt
flavor
hear
not
dominated
by
sweetness
and
not
dried
out
with
adjuncts
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
light
but
noticable
body
and
a
quick
finish
this
is
a
well
done
cream
ale
that
is
ideal
for
a
summer
barbecue
the
clear
bottle
is
a
mistake
imo
pours
a
crystal
clear
glod
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
and
ok
lace
a
timid
aroma
of
sweet
malt
that
is
mixed
with
some
riciness
as
a
cream
ale
its
ok
not
bad
flavor
for
such
a
macro
but
not
super
flavorful
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
that
has
a
bit
of
rice
added
followed
by
a
decent
hop
bitterness
that
balances
ok
finishes
dry
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
if
you
are
looking
for
something
better
than
average
as
a
macro
cream
ale
its
ok
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
am
i
missing
all
the
good
beer
in
canada
a
cheap
beer
to
drink
with
little
in
terms
of
satisfaction
why
drink
at
all
sweet
clean
malt
nose
very
carbonated
light
gold
tranparent
look
in
the
pint
glass
airy
pale
white
head
on
the
pour
this
head
dissapates
quickly
plainish
flat
malt
taste
on
the
tongue
there
is
some
sweetness
there
but
no
other
complexity
slight
cardboard
oxidized
finish
medium
mouth
not
a
future
purchase
again
for
frank
the
beer
after
is
escape
from
the
330ml
clear
bottle
resides
in
my
glass
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
smallish
bright
white
semicreamy
head
after
is
dissolution
the
lace
forms
a
thin
veil
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
fresh
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
light
top
is
thin
finish
is
modestly
carbonated
and
the
hops
run
of
the
mill
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
and
to
me
that
means
a
lot
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
ale
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
thats
disappearing
way
too
fast
i
can
already
smell
skunk
has
a
poured
the
beer
the
taste
is
quite
weak
with
a
mix
of
light
malt
and
a
weak
creamy
feeling
this
is
truly
a
bad
beer
could
be
a
bad
bottle
but
what
do
people
expect
with
clear
bottle
at
first
taste
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
bud
for
a
second
had
to
look
twice
at
the
top
label
to
make
sure
im
drinking
the
right
stuff
here
anyway
pours
out
a
pale
gold
color
with
some
carbonation
visible
smell
consisted
of
sweet
caramel
with
some
slight
hops
in
the
background
or
i
hope
those
were
hops
taste
wasnt
all
that
great
some
cream
can
be
tasted
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
quite
clean
to
my
disappointment
light
body
still
have
one
more
bottle
left
so
i
guess
ill
have
to
suck
it
up
and
drink
it
but
a
cream
ale
please
go
pick
up
some
rogue
cream
ale
and
see
what
a
real
cream
ale
is
supposed
to
be
very
grainy
and
proud
on
the
tongue
perfect
light
golden
color
and
strong
beer
taste
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
this
a
special
drink
and
unfortunately
all
styles
are
very
similar
i
include
the
cream
ale
honey
brown
lager
silver
creek
lager
and
original
dark
into
this
review
this
is
an
ok
beer
on
drinkability
theres
nothing
really
awful
about
it
but
theres
nothing
great
about
it
either
these
sleemans
offerings
are
totally
lame
dont
even
waste
your
time
on
these
adjunct
ridden
syrupy
sweet
beers
wow
that
word
describes
this
brew
best
smooth
flavor
and
very
refreshing
strong
notes
of
corn
and
a
hint
of
hops
short
lived
head
and
medium
carbonation
had
some
of
this
over
in
canada
and
was
pleased
to
find
its
now
available
state
side
worth
the
price
about
7
50
a
sixer
and
a
marked
step
up
from
what
one
would
expect
from
canadian
beers
highly
recommended
poured
a
crystal
clear
dark
straw
color
with
a
virtually
nonexistent
cap
that
refused
to
lace
and
only
formed
a
small
ring
highly
carbonated
aromas
of
boiled
hop
and
some
things
that
dont
belong
in
beer
like
corn
or
rice
or
cabbage
started
sharp
because
of
the
high
carbonation
light
malt
taste
some
astringic
hops
with
a
fizzy
mouth
feel
then
a
dry
watery
finish
not
really
much
better
than
labatts
50
just
marketing
and
packaging
differences
this
is
a
good
beer
for
frosh
belching
competitions
first
time
i
had
this
ale
thought
it
was
quite
good
the
ale
was
served
in
a
frosted
glass
the
cream
ale
held
a
head
through
out
the
glass
smell
very
light
mouthfeel
thin
for
a
cream
aledrinkability
after
a
couple
would
have
like
too
have
a
couple
more
but
no
the
wife
you
know
i
tried
this
once
and
it
taste
horrible
i
thought
that
maybe
it
was
skunked
so
i
tried
it
again
still
horrible
after
reading
other
reviews
i
think
it
just
might
be
the
beer
and
not
the
clear
bottle
why
well
this
beer
simply
smelled
and
tasted
pungent
pilsner
like
skunkiness
times
10
real
grainy
taste
in
the
mouth
and
some
residual
sweetness
strong
alcohol
flavor
which
is
weird
since
its
very
moderate
in
abv
a
slight
creaminess
in
the
middle
was
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
this
beer
not
recommended
drinkability
not
too
bad
overall
a
good
session
beer
but
lacking
in
anything
to
really
savor
this
is
a
drinkin
beer
that
is
the
equivalent
of
elevator
muzac
ok
because
of
creamy
tastemouthfeel
but
nowhere
near
a
creemore
dry
crisp
better
than
mediocre
national
brands
of
which
sleeman
is
now
3
oily
taste
with
cream
like
a
latte
ok
pour
dried
out
my
mouth
mates
ranked
it
about
the
same
or
a
tad
higher
cream
ales
are
an
underrated
style
id
like
to
see
more
local
brewers
try
their
hand
at
brewing
this
style
sleeman
products
have
just
recently
started
to
show
up
in
force
in
the
motown
area
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
offerings
not
a
bad
ale
this
light
amber
brew
came
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
minmal
lace
the
nose
is
light
a
gives
mostly
a
malt
sense
with
a
small
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
pleasant
if
not
overly
impressive
the
feel
is
creamy
and
medium
with
a
strong
crisp
finish
and
ending
dryness
drinkable
and
enjoyable
though
better
are
certainly
available
pours
out
a
golden
colour
with
a
head
that
disappears
nose
of
malt
hops
and
something
kinda
creamy
but
not
exactly
still
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
it
worked
well
with
a
light
lunch
ham
sandwich
and
chips
it
is
slightly
above
average
worth
having
around
when
there
is
extra
cash
one
thing
about
sleemans
is
that
they
make
their
beer
average
and
consistent
the
cream
ale
being
one
of
their
flagship
beers
holds
true
to
this
pours
out
of
the
classic
clear
embossed
bottle
why
clear
guys
a
clear
bright
golden
hue
snap
pop
fizzle
for
a
head
which
immediately
disappears
grainy
malt
on
the
nose
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
flavour
is
malty
crisp
with
a
small
finish
of
hops
pretty
straight
forward
nothing
unique
or
spectacular
about
it
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
oily
although
i
could
handle
this
as
a
session
beer
even
if
it
wouldnt
particularly
be
close
to
my
top
choice
as
one
but
its
pretty
good
as
an
average
beer
posing
as
a
cream
ale
notes
too
harsh
for
me
a
bit
boring
as
well

there
is
no
need
to
back
to
this
one
for
me
taste
fizzy
yet
creamy
not
exactly
round
but
its
not
a
lightbodied
beer
either
a
creamy
sweetness
with
some
graininess
neither
impressive
nor
offensive
will
not
purchase
again
flavor
is
sweet
malty
and
slightly
sugary
very
little
hop
presence
some
sweet
caramel
and
honey
flavors
body
is
light
with
rather
pleasant
carbonation
very
nice
mouthfeel
tasty
despite
its
initial
sweetness
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
but
id
drink
one
if
its
offered
clear
medium
gold
color
with
a
14
inch
pale
head
of
very
slight
duration
a
pretty
distinct
caramel
and
brown
sugar
malty
sweet
aroma
hinting
at
either
malt
complexity
or
cloying
properties
the
flavor
doesnt
cash
in
on
the
aroma
one
way
or
the
other
cane
sugar
and
a
slight
sense
of
flowery
honey
medium
carbonation
and
very
little
hop
sense
to
balance
drinkable
enough
i
suppose
but
the
sugar
water
in
the
hummingbird
feeder
might
be
almost
as
satisfying
still
as
a
cream
ale
an
ok
beer
here
i
was
expecting
a
craftbrewed
taste
but
got
something
that
just
marginally
tops
labatt
or
molson
underwhelming
light
clean
aroma
with
hints
of
grains
the
taste
is
unremarkable
somewhat
grainy
with
slightly
sweet
malts
present
only
deep
into
the
quaff
long
lasting
biscuity
aftertaste
some
minimal
hopping
actually
significantly
less
than
i
had
anticipated
the
so
called
creaminess
of
this
beer
is
very
much
absent
at
least
to
me
spectacular
in
its
ordinariness
in
the
mouth
its
a
cream
ale
smooth
creamy
light
and
refreshing
this
is
very
drinkable
though
unremarkable
i
didnt
find
it
overly
filling
but
then
i
just
had
the
one
bottle
f
had
this
in
a
can
while
on
a
fishing
trip
cans
are
much
more
convenient
in
the
outdoors
anyways
i
brought
my
glass
so
i
can
pour
it
while
at
lunch
wow
sleeman
from
a
can
smells
good
very
smooth
and
malty
scents
are
marching
up
my
nose
before
i
even
tilt
the
can
ahh
now
in
the
glass
hmm
good
head
amber
colour
similar
to
the
bottle
version
taste
huh
where
is
the
taste
i
can
smell
malt
why
cant
i
taste
it
this
was
bland
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
can
i
dont
know
mouthfeel
their
was
a
mouthfeel
it
was
too
unoffensive
to
leave
a
mouthfeel
i
give
it
a
higher
drinkability
rating
because
it
is
drinkable
like
diet
sprite
the
bottled
version
was
better
i
honestly
hope
i
just
had
a
bad
can
nevertheless
oneandahalf
thumbs
up
sure
beats
molson
canadian
i
like
sleemans
unique
bottles
but
i
wish
they
werent
clear
this
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
with
a
small
but
thick
head
touches
of
grain
and
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
pretty
reserved
though
theres
nothing
special
and
exciting
about
the
flavor
but
its
definitely
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
experience
its
a
great
alternative
to
the
macros
and
very
easy
to
drink
color
is
golden
yellow
sort
of
hazy
smells
sweet
and
light
of
maltyness
and
a
hint
of
hops
and
vanilla
taste
generally
the
same
as
the
smell
fairly
light
good
body
though
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
and
notes
of
slight
hop
and
vanilla
very
smooth
crisp
and
clean
coats
the
tongue
and
mouth
with
creamy
sweetness
not
bitter
in
the
least
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
this
stuff
highly
drinkable
with
a
burger
and
fries
or
for
picnics
and
outdoor
backyard
bbqs
very
good
cream
ale
go
sleemans
ya
got
a
winner
here
good
head
and
nice
lace
on
an
otherwise
unimpressive
beer
not
bad
mind
you
just
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
not
very
complex
but
very
smooth
typical
canadian
yeasty
aftertaste
better
than
average
and
the
best
of
the
sleeman
line
this
still
seems
a
bit
mainstream
not
much
hop
taste
not
much
hop
nose
this
is
very
light
beer
a
notch
above
the
macros
a
classic
the
seven
ounce
bottles
are
genius
they
go
down
so
quick
cream
ale
taste
is
a
good
wrinkle
on
60s70s
style
big
productions
beers
an
interesting
local
oddity
the
flavor
is
somewhat
interesting
but
it
isnt
a
great
beer
by
any
regard
some
lingering
creaminess
if
you
imagine
really
hard
pours
to
a
thick
white
head
that
makes
fish
eye
bubbles
and
pale
gold
color
aroma
is
sweet
corny
and
slightly
fruity
flavor
is
the
same
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tingly
pretty
decent
cream
ale
deviated
from
craft
a
little
bit
with
this
one
and
was
so
glad
that
i
did
was
blown
away
by
how
well
this
stood
up
to
other
beers
in
the
industry
today
this
retro
brand
still
has
it
and
believe
it
or
not
this
won
a
gabf
medal
in
the
past
bought
this
simply
because
my
mom
has
always
talked
about
having
little
kings
when
she
was
younger
but
it
was
turned
out
to
be
much
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
its
a
bit
light
on
the
taste
and
is
expectedly
light
in
color
and
feel
but
the
taste
isnt
bad
at
all
and
is
actually
quite
smooth
when
compared
to
most
of
the
other
noncraft
offerings
ive
had
ill
take
a
little
kings
everyday
you
know
occasionally
and
very
occasionally
i
like
to
deviate
from
the
craft
beer
i
love
so
much
for
a
little
refresher
course
about
why
i
spend
so
much
time
and
money
and
energy
on
this
passion
of
mine
and
its
beer
like
this
that
serves
that
purpose
so
well
classic
cheap
cream
ale
in
a
cute
little
package
its
got
a
mild
skunk
to
the
nose
but
other
than
that
is
an
extremely
passable
macro
tasting
brew
malty
enough
in
a
light
pils
sort
of
way
and
not
lacking
in
flavor
at
all
it
has
a
little
body
wonderfully
refreshing
carbonation
and
a
pretty
snappy
finish
a
fine
refresher
overall
its
honestly
not
very
good
but
its
also
not
all
that
bad
especially
when
judged
against
its
peers
what
it
doesnt
have
though
is
any
real
hop
profile
anything
unique
or
interesting
an
appreciable
yeast
character
or
any
capacity
to
hold
my
attention
or
inspire
me
in
any
way
whatsoever
craft
beer
has
and
does
at
least
most
of
those
things
most
of
the
time
and
thats
why
i
love
it
so
much
it
makes
me
think
and
it
makes
me
move
and
im
not
sure
what
i
would
be
mentally
or
physically
if
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
drank
all
the
time
i
dont
hate
it
i
am
actually
thankful
for
it
today
for
reminding
me
again
why
i
am
so
into
craft
beer
this
though
is
well
enough
crafted
that
i
just
might
buy
it
again
someday
this
certainly
is
easy
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
pretty
good
beer
to
start
with
all
and
all
as
good
as
i
remember
its
a
good
beer
nice
and
light
good
flavor
could
be
creamier
but
not
bad
for
the
price
ringa
ling
its
little
king
used
to
pour
em
down
back
in
the
day
still
one
of
the
better
cream
ales
hard
to
beat
that
7
ounce
treat
o
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
midafternoon
beer
for
the
holiday
surprised
that
it
had
no
skunkiness
to
it
since
it
comes
in
the
clear
green
bottle
overall
a
respectable
3
75
i
didnt
find
one
thing
offensive
about
this
brew
and
again
the
clean
finish
was
very
liked
by
yours
truly
overall
it
looks
like
your
typical
beer
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
it
was
o
k
but
not
my
style
of
brew
it
seems
like
this
beer
would
be
about
average
for
the
style
the
greats
are
significantly
better
and
the
terrible
ones
significantly
worse
little

cream
ale
brewed
by
hudepohlschoenling
brewing
co
this
brew
is
something
the
old
timers
talk
about
a
lot
so
i
had
to
try
it
out
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
5
and
it
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
this
brew
is
darker
than
your
american
style
lager
little
kings
has
a
small
white
head
that
goes
away
fast
now
keep
in
mind
this
beer
is
in
a
7
oz
bottle
the
smell
is
strong
and
bold
with
flavor
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
i
like
how
this
brew
is
bold
with
flavor
but
it
goes
down
crisp
and
refreshing
mouth
feel
is
good
this
brew
smooth
over
all
i
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
im
really
impressed
with
this
brew
i
will
get
this
again
overall
far
better
than
expected
a
quite
decent
little
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
now
that
i
have
tasted
it
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
i
was
a
little
skeptical
of
this
beer
coming
in
a
green
7
oz
bottle
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
wasnt
really
that
bad
o
nice
fruitiness
and
very
refreshing
nice
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
my
wife
who
likes
7oz
beers
o
a
cincinnati
classic
that
i
had
to
revisit
in
a
more
serious
light
its
not
bad
for
the
style
finishes
dry
like
its
light
lager
brethren
but
with
more
sweetness
up
front
yet
lacks
the
sugarsweetness
of
a
malt
liquor
and
thankfully
the
undercurrent
of
ethanol
this
is
an
light
beer
that
is
simple
but
unoffensive
o
well
its
a
cream
ale
pretty
simple
pretty
sweet
almost
too
sweet
no
bitterness
or
hop
flavors
at
all
it
appears
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
an
extrasweet
budweiser
o
gee
i
guess
my
tastes
have
changed
i
remember
this
being
so
flavorful
and
good
i
swear
i
could
taste
the
cream
that
makes
it
a
cream
ale
this
was
only
slightly
better
than
a
bmc
on
the
upside
my
wife
loved
it
she
went
crazy
for
it
wants
me
to
get
more
asap
haha
little
kings
werent
one
of
my
go
to
beers
back
in
the
70s
and
80s
although
robin
hood
cream
ale
was
always
a
treat
and
not
because
i
didnt
like
em
but
probably
because
the
bottles
were
too
small
for
my
beer
guzzling
tastes
well
if
the
current
edition
is
similar
to
those
old
days
than
i
can
say
this
is
a
decent
enough
ale
nothing
spectacular
per
se
flavorful
and
refreshing
enough
to
go
back
and
have
some
more
this
is
not
a
prime
example
of
this
beer
i
am
not
aware
of
too
many
places
they
go
through
it
fast
around
here
though
i
bought
it
to
have
a
traditional
cincinnati
beer
for
opening
day
i
can
say
straight
away
that
this
is
a
beer
that
i
think
anybody
could
drink
and
not
spit
out
in
disgust
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
beer
in
my
opinion
and
thats
the
reason
why
early
on
i
got
a
lot
of
a
vanillavodka
flavor
after
a
few
sips
i
pretty
much
tasted
nothing
and
there
was
no
bitterness
i
rate
it
as
highly
as
i
do
because
its
super
sessionable
drinkable
inoffensive
and
just
really
good
for
any
occasion
not
just
that
but
the
bottles
attractive
especially
id
think
for
the
female
drinkers
the
bottles
a
measly
7oz
this
is
a
light
very
sessionable
beer
that
can
replace
and
american
lager
theres
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
and
a
light
body
that
allows
you
to
put
away
several
of
these
little
bottles
overall
a
fairly
nonoffensive
although
below
average
cream
ale
the
sweetness
limits
drinkability
somewhat
but
i
could
see
having
a
few
every
once
in
awhile
this
is
a
sweet
beer
that
seems
like
a
macro
with
three
teaspoons
of
sugar
added
not
creamy
but
i
would
say
it
is
full
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
similar
to
the
aftertaste
of
cocacola
overall
autumn
or
spring
beer
that
is
almost
a
daily
drinker
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
disappears
within
seconds
leaving
very
feint
lacing
smell
is
strongly
of
butterscotch
which
is
perfect
for
me
seeing
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
flavorings
the
taste
somewhat
follows
the
smell
butterscotch
with
a
small
amount
of
adjunct
coming
through
though
the
butterscotch
stays
dominant
the
mouthfeel
was
really
the
only
thing
that
disappointed
me
about
this
beer
very
slight
notes
of
butterscotch
in
the
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
strong
cooked
corn
adjunct
flavor
and
a
strong
almost
unfathomable
metallic
taste
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
throat
though
the
butterscotch
somewhat
saves
the
mouthfeel
from
getting
a
very
low
rating
and
it
prevails
in
the
end
thebeeralmanac
com
average
mouthfeel
for
a
cream
ale
noticeably
thicker
than
a
pale
lager
but
pretty
insubstantial
for
an
ale
a
touch
too
slick
but
thats
nitpicking
overall
this
is
a
fine
cream
ale
it
has
flavor
which
always
helps
its
like
the
flavor
of
lean
you
never
knew
you
wanted
only
without
the
codeine
overall
i
was
a
little
skeptical
at
first
trying
a
cream
ale
turns
out
i
love
it
d
it
is
simple
small
and
pretty
good
tastings
5
5
and
7oz
a
good
session
beer
just
wish
it
came
in
a
bigger
bottle
the
crack
glug
produced
two
thick
foamy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
very
pretty
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
which
brightened
my
day
on
the
postsnowy
day
leading
up
to
hallowistmas
nose
was
very
sweet
almost
sugary
in
its
intensity
i
can
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
who
mentioned
pineapple
esters
in
his
review
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
sweet
canned
corn
taste
in
the
mouth
finish
was
still
very
sweet
and
i
began
to
fear
for
an
onset
of
diabetes
it
was
not
bad
but
it
just
was
not
my
cuppa
tea
overall
drinkability
hohum
overall
nothing
terribly
special
but
not
bad
either
quite
drinkable
though
its
there
and
its
gone
went
well
with
pulled
pork
bbq
and
i
suspect
it
would
be
good
with
a
lot
of
other
meat
and
grilled
dishes
o
this
was
okay
it
was
fun
to
try
once
but
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
for
this
one
overall
drinkability
decent
smooth
inoffensive
uninteresting
sort
of
bland
use
to
drink
these
all
the
time
in
highschool
then
they
disappeared
forever
and
was
i
ever
happy
to
see
them
again
not
necessarily
for
taste
but
because
of
memories
nothing
special
about
this
beer
as
far
as
anything
goes
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
half
a
finger
of
sudsy
head
that
is
gone
within
seconds
at
first
pour
the
beer
had
a
skunky
presence
about
it
luckily
that
went
away
after
opening
up
in
the
glass
from
here
on
out
both
nose
and
mouth
experience
the
same
thing
sweet
corn
and
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
grass
in
there
probably
the
skunk
i
smelt
during
the
pour
has
a
sweet
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
dryfinish
overall
worth
it
for
the
novelty
of
seven
oz
bottles
that
arent
over
priced
just
a
decent
sweet
grainy
beer
on
a
hot
day
reviewed
form
notes
enjoyed
many
times
over
the
years
reviewed
here
for
the
first
time
little
7oz
bottle
poured
into
pilsner
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
half
inch
head
funky
smell
of
sourdough
and
corn
with
a
bit
of
yeast
taste
isnt
funky
at
all
for
a
green
glass
bottle
however
it
does
have
a
distinctive
funky
smell
which
is
more
akin
to
an
american
adjunct
lager
then
a
cream
ale
but
the
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
good
mix
of
the
usual
corn
biscuity
sourdough
and
a
mellow
hop
in
there
as
well
not
as
creamy
as
genesees
cream
ale
but
smooth
and
very
drinkable
nonetheless
the
other
remarkable
thing
is
that
at
5
5
abv
over
the
course
of
blowing
through
the
7oz
bottles
in
a
session
the
alcohol
can
definitely
become
apparent
for
this
stinky
lil
lovely
that
is
always
great
with
pizza
ive
had
this
in
the
new
12oz
red
bull
like
cans
which
actually
is
a
little
more
cleaned
up
and
less
funky
but
not
nearly
as
enjoyable
as
the
green
glass
which
adds
funk
instead
of
skunk
but
only
in
the
smell
department
great
price
too
for
either
bottles
or
cans
hope
this
stays
in
production
again
for
years
to
come
a
lawnmower
beer
at
best
not
bad
but
nothing
memorable
either
curious
looking
beer
and
im
talking
about
the
bottle
pours
a
straw
yellow
very
clear
modest
offwhite
head
with
low
retention
and
lacing
very
subtle
nose
consisting
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
sweet
malty
cereal
flavor
a
bit
floral
nothing
really
stands
out
the
palate
is
light
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
thin
body
with
ample
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
for
the
most
part
this
is
like
drinking
carbonated
water
with
some
artificial
flavors
in
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
everything
in
the
nose
taste
and
feel
the
beer
is
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
it
smells
of
buttered
biscuits
and
sour
grain
the
taste
is
similar
with
grain
and
honey
butter
with
a
hint
of
cream
soda
this
beer
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
might
get
old
after
awhile
but
a
few
of
em
are
good
o
goes
down
easily
ok
taste
not
filling
low
kick
ok
representation
of
style
although
the
beer
wasnt
unpleasant
the
apple
flavoring
and
aftertaste
make
this
a
one
and
done
for
me
from
the
7
fl
oz
bottle
no
2741018180k
sampled
on
june
30
2011
the
label
looks
like
something
out
of
1950
it
has
a
pale
yellow
to
nearly
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
burst
of
white
fizzy
head
that
settles
down
in
seconds
green
bottle
skunkiness
rules
the
day
but
once
you
take
that
into
account
you
get
a
bready
malty
aroma
that
isnt
half
bad
the
body
is
waterytomedium
but
fits
the
style
the
taste
is
lightly
malted
but
mainly
bready
and
biscuity
with
a
slight
hop
bite
thrown
in
for
good
measure
i
paid
1
95
for
an
eight
pack
of
these
little
seven
ouncers
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
good
enough
for
the
beach
easy
to
hide
in
your
beach
bag
overall
a
tasty
cream
ale
not
an
overly
exciting
style
but
a
good
rendition
nonetheless
o
this
is
a
better
than
average
cream
ale
and
ill
be
certain
to
drink
more
than
a
few
this
summer
o
seems
to
be
a
decent
little
beer
taking
it
out
of
green
bottles
would
probably
help
but
i
would
not
continue
to
drink
this
at
1
a
bottle
8
per
8
pack
of
7
ounce
bottles
it
was
interesting
to
try
o
a
decent
little
beer
and
a
great
alternative
to
the
watered
down
mass
produced
ubiquitous
beers
rjt
taste
is
creamed
corn
mineral
light
grassiness
lightly
sweet
apple
cider
faint
tart
apple
zestiness
and
alight
cornapple
aftertaste
it
tend
slightly
to
the
sweeter
side
with
a
character
predominantly
of
lightly
sweet
zesty
apple
and
corn
that
said
it
has
an
enjoyable
firm
character
if
simple
and
light
poured
from
2
green
7
oz
bottles
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
could
be
those
dreaded
green
bottles
taste
also
has
a
bit
of
skunk
to
it
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
slightly
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
overall
due
to
its
size
i
cant
really
take
this
ale
seriously
to
me
it
seemed
more
like
a
party
favor
rather
then
a
refreshing
alcoholic
beverage
this
being
my
first
cream
ale
i
cant
say
i
was
too
impressed
with
it
perhaps
i
bought
a
skunked
batch
but
what
ever
the
case
i
dont
think
id
purchase
this
again
this
has
a
good
nonintrusive
taste
and
is
meant
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
but
is
it
worth
the
premium
when
you
could
buy
a
macro
that
isnt
all
that
different
flavor
wise
poured
from
a
7
oz
bottle
golden
yellow
smells
of
grain
and
corn
sort
of
sweet
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
very
refreshing
in
your
mouth
this
is
a
really
a
nice
retro
beer
and
i
have
finished
off
a
case
of
7
oz
bottles
in
three
days
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
very
nice
session
beer
and
very
enjoyable
give
it
a
try
it
sure
surprised
me
a
retro
brand
looking
for
another
heyday

white
lace
crackles
a
bit

stays

and
subtle
grassy
grain
light
fluffy
body
with
a
snappy
crispness
kiss
of
sweet
ness
to
start
with
cooked
veggies
and
a
bready
undertone
muted
hops
just
provide
a
balancing
bitterness
hint
of
alcohol
and
twang
of
fermented
grain
clean

it
is
what
it
is
a
nofrills
brewski
that
is
easy
to
put
down
if
youre
into

this
beer
also
told
us
that
it
should
be
paired
with
chili

the

its
smooth
syrupy

makes
this
an
enjoyable
drink
despite
the
lacking
flavor
profile
a
decent

brew
even
though
or
especially
because
you
have
to
drink
twice
as
many

this
beer
would
be
a
nice
thirst
quencher
during
a
hot

day
its
slightly
better
than
most

however
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
this

with
average
amount
of
head
and
carbonation
slightly
frothy
but
with
an
average
aroma
of
barley
hops
as
well
i
love
the
small
bottle
as
it
makes
this
more
drinkable
as
this
beer
would
probably
lose
its
appeal
in
a
12
oz
bottle
worth
a
try
man
this
was
interesting
um
i
am
at
a
loss
for
words
i
think
this
is
one
you
drink
from
a
bottle
anything
to
help
contain
the
smell
not
for
my
the
bottle
was
about
6
70
ounces
too
much
poured
a
clear
yellowamber
with
a
super
small
white
fizzy
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
and
had
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
grain
malts
a
grassy
hop
and
a
soapy
yeast
it
tasted
sweet
with
an
ever
so
light
hoppiness
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
creamy
yet
watery
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
a
very
light
brew
which
is
typical
of
cream
ales
but
have
to
say
it
is
quite
drinkable
yet
nothing
special
d
very
sessionable
ill
give
it
that
not
sure
ive
had
any
other
cream
ales
but
i
brewed
a
little
kings
clone
one
time
that
didnt
turn
out
good
so
i
recommend
to
just
buy
it
good
for
a
quick
beer
after
a
hot
dayreminds
me
of
the
old
styles
and
old
milwaukees
my
dad
used
to
drink
drinkability
if
it
tastes
awful
how
could
the
drinkability
be
any
better
i
did
drink
the
whole
bottle
7oz
but
if
you
gave
me
the
rest
of
my
life
i
would
not
want
to
finish
this
whole
8
pack
what
a
cute
wittwe
bottwe
it
pours
a
clear
pale
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
flowers
wheat
lemongrass
and
a
pinch
of
powdered
sugar
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
grass
flowers
light
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
cream
cheese
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
nice
little
cream
ale
well
worth
the
minuscule
price
tag
considering
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
poundable
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
when
you
want
something
very
light
served
at
refrigerator
temperature
color
is
a
bronzygolden
hue
smells
of
malt
and
subtly
wet
cardboard
could
be
very
slightly
skunky
which
makes
sense
given
the
green
glass
bottle
the
cream
in
this
ale
is
obvious
and
pleasant
most
of
the
reviews
of
this
beer
describe
this
as
an
unpleasant
brew
which
i
suspect
is
due
mostly
to
the
green
glass
bottles
given
proper
storage
this
is
probably
a
fun
different
beer
light
however
is
not
a
friend
the
small
bottles
7oz
are
a
good
choice
as
this
beer
should
be
consumed
quickly
after
pouring
d
not
i
had
a
few
threw
the
rest
of
the
case
away
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
active
sudsy
carbonation
but
a
seltzery
diminished
head
leaves
no
real
lace
of
which
to
speak
the
nose
is
of
creamed
corn
some
vanilla
and
light
plastic
notes
flavors
are
superficial
not
built
on
a
real
malt
base
rather
a
vanilla
flavoring
and
macro
corn
notes
the
finish
is
a
lingering
sweet
vanilla
not
bad
but
certainly
nothing
memorable
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
tiny
little
white
head
no
more
than
a
rim
and
absolutely
no
lacing
smells
of
creamed
corn
and
very
sweet
very
one
note
on
taste
sweet
and
a
lot
like
corn
with
a
little
balanced
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
drinkability
is
high
d
really
not
bad
you
wont
mistake
it
for
the
good
stuff
but
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
making
it
a
goto
cheap
beer
to
switch
things
up
and
knocking
back
a
few
cans
of
this
with
some
burgers
d
traditional
american
swill
better
than
bmc
but
still
very
similar
dsome
palates
may
appreciate
what
was
attempted
here
just
not
mine
glad
i
have
only
7oz
of
this
before
moving
on
the
something
better
i
hope
never
had
a
cream
beer
before
so
i
decided
to
grab
some
little
kings
and
give
it
a
shot
im
drinking
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
dont
know
how
much
head
and
etc
there
is
but
based
on
drinking
it
theres
not
much
head
lacing
etc
basically
this
beer
doesnt
need
a
review
it
just
needs
to
be
known
as
a
very
slightly
creamy
sweet
version
of
heineken
without
that
heiny
aftertaste
if
its
cheap
and
you
just
want
to
pound
some
beers
that
go
down
easily
and
stay
that
way
for
a
while
go
for
it
this
beer
is
presented
in
a
little
seven
ounce
green
bottle
the
dark
golden
beer
has
little
head
above
the
aroma
seems
to
exude
a
mixture
sweet
corn
and
malt
the
sweetness
intensifies
on
the
palate
with
similar
flavors
the
texture
is
almost
syrupy
it
finishes
with
nary
a
hint
of
bitterness
perhaps
the
size
of
the
bottle
portends
whats
inside
d
this
beer
was
clean
and
light
but
had
some
interesting
depth
to
the
flavors
that
were
there
it
went
down
smooth
and
didnt
really
have
one
flavor
that
overpowered
any
other
flavor
its
to
bad
it
was
a
7oz
bottle
as
i
could
have
drank
a
whole
12
oz
in
one
session
d
what
makes
this
a
cream
ale
no
cream
taste
and
not
really
creamy
on
the
palate
a
bit
too
sweet
with
very
little
to
no
character
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
there
are
a
veritable
ton
of
better
creations
out
there
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
with
a
very
light
almost
sweet
dry
aftertaste
its
hard
not
to
like
this
beer
more
but
then
again
i
like
beers
that
have
more
tastes
whether
that
of
roasted
malts
or
cascade
hops
or
being
aged
in
whiskey
casks
whatever
i
would
rather
have
just
more
of
something
from
this
beer
had
this
beer
just
to
try
not
to
impressed
as
there
was
nothing
special
although
it
came
in
a
70z
bottle
which
was
nice
and
very
cheap
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
beer
at
the
beach
the
cream
was
not
over
whelming
which
was
nice
even
though
i
was
not
to
overly
impressed
by
this
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
to
try
and
would
have
in
the
future
taste
makes
me
thankful
these
are
only
in
7
oz
bottles
grainy
adjuncts
with
a
decent
amount
of
ale
yeast
fruitiness
creamy
body
is
not
bad
and
is
pretty
well
done
for
the
style
it
is
drinkable
in
the
way
that
an
american
malt
liquor
can
be
when
the
need
strikes
a
bit
pricey
for
that
to
entice
me
to
purchase
an
8pack
anytime
soon
a
fotay
of
oe
800
can
do
the
trick
for
about
a
fifth
of
the
price
meh
not
impressed
but
didnt
have
too
much
problem
finishing
my
minibottle
ive
never
understood
how
cream
ale
didnt
become
americas
choice
beer
instead
of
the
adjunct
lager
this
beer
has
some
flavor
and
is
supremely
drinkable
the
carbonation
level
isnt
so
amped
up
that
it
hurts
when
you
drink
it
too
quickly
if
nothing
else
at
least
get
your
macro
loving
friends
to
switch
to
something
like
this
this
is
almost
dangerously
drinkable
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
though
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
havent
minded
drinking
this
8pack
even
a
little
bit
that
said
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
more
than
a
few
times
a
year
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
regularly
i
would
recommend
it
and
hope
that
you
get
to
try
one
that
is
as
fresh
as
this
one
i
am
drinking
now
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
good
head
decent
lacing
and
a
lot
of
bubbly
carbonation
very
sweet
lager
scent
with
a
slighlty
skunky
nose
decent
taste
a
very
sweet
creamy
malt
but
with
an
cloying
aftertaste
goes
down
quite
extremely
smooth
d
no
thanks
one
7oz
of
this
is
enough
for
me
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
im
not
enjoying
this
i
think
id
rather
drink
an
adjunct
lager
over
this
not
impressed
all
in
all
not
too
bad
for
the
style
ive
been
curious
about
this
one
for
awhile
admittedly
due
to
the
packaging
and
that
curiosity
is
now
satisfied
pours
a
cleanclear
golden
pale
yellow
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
white
head
very
little
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hop
note
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
a
hop
note
in
there
light
body
barely
drinkable
not
impressed
at
all
this
brew
showed
up
in
the
sls
here
in
layton
what
a
bunch
of
wasted
space
for
this
one
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
who
knows
i
might
d
it
is
ok
has
a
sort
of
standard
taste
and
is
somewhat
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
go
seek
it
out
though
nice
to
try
this
again
d
im
sure
if
i
was
able
to
get
a
fresh
hidden
from
the
light
bottle
it
would
be
better
but
probably
not
by
much
not
worth
it
i
had
some
little
kings
over
30
years
ago
and
was
not
impressed
my
opinion
had
changed
somewhat
during
the
intervening
years
while
not
a
great
beer
it
wasnt
that
bad
and
i
wouldnt
have
minded
guzzling
half
a
dozen
under
the
right
circumstances
skunky
aroma
at
first
becoming
grainy
and
musty
after
that
inoffensive
papery
grain
flavor
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
fairly
light
sort
of
crisp
but
still
a
bit
watery
vague
suggestion
of
sweet
apple
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
simple
and
easy
to
drink
in
a
nonintellectual
way
an
average
lawnmower
beer
overall
nothing
special
for
a
cream
ale
but
nothing
bad
or
offensive
either
just
because
the
size
is
interesting
i
would
buy
a
few
of
these
again
i
would
like
to
try
another
one
of
these
and
see
if
i
get
the
same
skunky
smell
because
without
that
i
could
see
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
its
a
good
little
beer
had
not
had
this
in
about
twentyfive
or
so
years
picked
up
an
eight
pack
to
see
if
it
might
bring
back
so
old
memories
it
did
most
of
them
not
to
bad
but
i
understood
why
it
had
been
so
long
to
sum
it
up
ill
call
this
one
a
mass
quantity
beer
as
compared
to
a
quality
brew
not
really
all
that
bad
but
its
amazing
the
stuff
i
used
to
put
away
as
compared
to
now
d
cheap
crappy
nostalgia
beer
even
genny
cream
is
a
bit
more
palatable
good
thing
it
was
only
7
oz
the
foam
was
white
in
color
bubbly
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
light
golden
yellow
with
hints
of
amber
the
smell
was
of
a
typical
american
pils
nice
ballance
of
hops
and
barley
the
taste
to
me
was
like
an
average
mainstream
pils
with
some
bitterness
and
small
undertones
of
wheat
and
lemon
mouthfeel
light
to
mediumbodied
drinkability
better
than
the
average
watered
down
beer
bottle
at
pprbsg09
thanks
to
beastiefan2k
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
pale
malt
flavor
of
light
corn
malt
some
bready
notes
and
sweet
fruits
actually
i
found
this
chill
and
drinkable
apparently
eugene
and
i
are
alone
in
thinking
this
d
overall
good
beer
for
nice
day
also
a
very
good
price
unless
these
come
complimentary
with
a
try
me
sticker
taped
to
the
back
of
a
bottle
of
wild
turkey
i
dont
think
im
game
enough
for
another
pale
golden
with
a
slight
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
settles
and
leaves
some
blotchy
lace
behind
toasted
sweet
corn
flakes
in
the
nose
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
very
little
hop
character
present
light
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
an
okay
beer
that
is
only
slightly
better
that
a
typical
macro
lager
got
this
in
a
trade
with
infestaxion
this
is
one
of
those
cult
beers
that
people
love
this
is
brewed
at
the
lion
in
wilkes
barre
pa
but
only
sold
in
the
midwest
poured
from
a
7
ounce
green
bottle
strangely
this
7
oz
is
actually
a
different
size
than
the
rolling
rock
7
oz
bottle
do
we
need
2
types
of
7
oz
beer
bottles
beer
poured
into
a
small
glass
yellow
color
with
small
head
the
beer
quickly
goes
flat
grainy
fruity
smell
you
can
smell
the
extra
alcohol
content
too
the
taste
reminds
me
of
beer
from
the
1980s
not
sure
if
the
beer
has
changed
or
i
am
just
not
drinking
the
cheapest
beer
around
these
days
drinkability
is
ok
nice
to
have
some
variety
out
there
when
i
drink
this
i
wonder
what
the
special
appeal
iswas
for
cream
ale
other
than
the
extra
kick
dont
see
it
small
white
head
clear
golden
yellow
and
very
active
carbonation
left
some
nice
lacing
sweet
and
malty
smelling
with
some
adjuncts
present
the
adjuncts
arent
as
offputting
here
as
they
are
in
macrolagers
adjuncts
seem
right
at
home
in
the
creamy
sweetness
pretty
tastey
stuff
but
its
not
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
d
you
could
hit
a
few
of
these
but
there
may
be
others
that
are
better
balanced
and
tastier
little
7
oz
bottle
of
green
my
whole
hand
wraps
around
it
it
halffilled
my
pint
glass
obviously
transparent
golden
yellow
color
with
a
tall
white
head
and
no
lacing
this
beer
kind
of
stinks
kind
of
mediciney
with
hints
of
straw
or
hay
and
sour
corn
tastes
like
cereal
grains
and
low
quality
ingredients
i
like
the
texture
however
kind
of
creamy
i
dont
like
the
bittersour
aftertaste
though
not
very
good
beer
im
glad
there
arent
5
more
ounces
to
be
honest
this
brew
pours
up
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
little
white
head
the
nose
is
grainy
with
pale
malts
and
subtle
hop
bittering
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
as
the
nose
but
a
tid
bit
sweeter
and
much
creamier
medium
bodied
low
carbo
a
clean
finish
a
pretty
solid
beer
now
i
know
why
them
yankees
love
this
beer
so
much
this
beer
actually
turned
out
to
be
fairly
well
brewed
and
is
easy
to
drink
id
prefer
this
to
many
american
lagers
an
amber
color
with
carbonation
bubbles
a
small
white
head
smell
is
corn
wheat
there
seems
to
be
a
floral
hint
and
a
hint
of
skunky
it
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
that
has
hints
of
skunk
with
corn
malt
and
hops
the
finish
is
short
lived
it
is
an
okay
beer
better
than
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
drinkable
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
is
well
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
i
drank
4
of
these
while
typing
this
review
a
rare
treat
reminiscent
of
some
hazy
college
days
little
kings
pack
some
power
and
are
very
drinkable
faint
skunky
aroma
not
offensive
at
all
medium
yellow
with
a
solid
white
head
creamy
to
the
palate
with
an
easy
finish
flavor
is
of
solid
creamy
malt
real
simple
but
its
good
d
i
used
to
drink
a
case
of
these
when
i
was
a
wee
lad
and
still
want
more
i
think
a
sixer
over
a
card
game
would
suffice
nowadays
this
beer
is
pure
nostalgia
for
me
its
like
comfort
food
thats
why
it
gets
a
4
5
for
drinkability
go
out
and
try
one
of
these
little
fellas
on
youll
see
they
have
a
nice
fit
poured
from
the
minibottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
yellowgolden
color
with
a
sparkling
white
head
and
a
stream
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
depths
of
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
distinct
sweetness
about
it
sort
of
a
vanillabanana
mixed
with
a
sweet
liquor
smell
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
corn
adjunct
to
it
but
other
than
that
a
slightly
sweet
maltyness
that
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
slightly
dry
finish
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
better
than
the
average
swill
for
sure
pours
a
clear
gloden
straw
hue
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
good
retention
and
light
spotty
lacing
lightstruck
aroma
with
background
pilsener
malt
slight
dms
aroma
and
a
hint
of
sulfer
yeast
sweet
pale
malt
and
mild
dextrins
upfront
with
some
sharp
pils
and
sweet
corn
notes
drying
aftertaste
with
a
suggestion
of
spicy
tettnanger
or
saaz
hop
flavor
despite
some
distracting
skunk
taste
this
shows
balanced
bitterness
with
a
genuine
preprohibition
pils
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
aids
this
effect
with
a
gentle
but
ample
carbonation
and
a
light
body
that
retains
some
sweetness
and
creamy
texture
goes
down
very
smooth
and
highly
quaffable
esecially
given
the
smaller
bottle
in
the
heat
of
summer
this
would
be
my
first
choice
for
lunch
out
on
the
patio
revisited
these
and
i
get
shit
tons
of
green
apple
have
never
noticed
this
much
in
any
beer
much
less
this
dominant
dont
recall
it
from
my
younger
days
drinking
this
either
not
that
i
was
paying
attention
almost
no
aroma
maybe
some
corn
and
green
apple
no
head
really
a
little
deeper
color
than
most
macros
first
time
out
of
hundreds
ive
poured
it
into
a
glass
best
cream
ale
is
from
sun
king
in
indiana
got
this
little
bottle
from
chris
and
drank
it
within
a
couple
of
weeks
of
being
shipped
to
dublin
it
was
not
too
full
of
flavor
but
poured
smooth
with
little
and
drank
easybasically
an
average
beer
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
it
is
rated
at
5
50
abv
and
i
dont
necessarily
taste
where
the
cream
ale
name
comes
from
but
i
would
drink
more
i
do
have
another
bottle
to
compare
this
first
one
toomaybe
i
will
drink
it
next
week
or
something
drinkability
sampled
for
posteritys
sake
not
my
kind
of
beer
though
i
would
buy
it
now
and
then
to
accomodate
the
swillmongers
i
basically
blasted
this
stuff
into
the
glass
and
i
got
no
head
at
all
its
flat
and
still
with
deep
yellow
body
bruised
apple
aroma
with
stale
hops
and
wet
paper
tastes
like
apple
juice
with
a
hop
pellet
in
it
very
one
dimensional
and
straight
forward
finishes
with
zero
carbonation
and
a
little
unpleasant
almost
as
nondescript
as
a
beer
can
be
ohh
my
hey
its
a
new
state
for
me
thanks
chris
straightup
pour
gives
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
light
bodied
and
light
carbonation
nose
is
a
faint
lemon
and
corn
starts
with
some
sweetness
mild
flavor
in
fact
hardly
any
flavor
not
worth
89
for
a
wussy
7
oz
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
no
creamy
aftertaste
like
i
would
expect
and
nothing
to
promp
me
to
buy
another
for
the
style
this
beer
is
average
on
the
palate
lightbodied
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
are
demonstrated
by
this
beer
and
that
seems
to
fit
the
stylistic
parameters
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
again
because
there
is
no
point
theres
nothing
special
to
this
beer
no
reason
to
drink
it
again
sure
its
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quite
smooth
and
very
easily
but
it
is
just
an
almost
average
beer
nothing
calls
me
back
to
this
beer
overall
a
beer
that
tastes
better
slugged
down
straight
from
the
bottle
because
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
change
from
decent
to
almost
bad
so
fast
i
didnt
find
it
very
drinkable
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
every
year
since
then
right
as
its
starting
to
get
warm
i
start
thinking
about
taking
another
trip
to
cedar
point
to
port
clinton
id
pay
most
of
my
own
way
now
of
course
but
itd
be
pretty
much
the
same
me
dad
sis
and
whatever
friends
we
want
to
bring
along
i
always
talk
about
it
to
whoever
is
around
when
the
idea
comes
into
my
head
they
always
agree
that
its
great
we
should
definitely
do
it
and
its
never
spoken
of
after
that
night
it
wouldnt
be
the
same
i
always
realize
that
when
i
sober
up
drinrkabilty
is
average
nothing
that
keeps
me
from
having
another
a
unique
beer
and
as
i
remember
it
when
i
last
had
it
10
years
ago
i
remember
i
used
to
stop
at
big
bear
on
my
way
home
from
work
when
i
was
in
college
and
pick
up
a
40
or
2
for
a
couple
of
bucks
time
hurries
on
taste
as
i
expected
is
allmalt
as
well
slightly
nutty
but
with
a
weird
and
unpleasant
sour
and
soapy
taste
is
that
supposed
to
be
the
bitters
whatever
it
is
its
wholly
unpleasant
thin
in
the
mouth
and
slightly
dry
going
down
yes
it
is
creamy
so
i
guess
the
description
fits
but
im
telling
ya
im
going
to
have
a
really
hard
time
choking
this
minibottle
down
ill
just
leave
it
to
the
ladies
beer
is
good
happy
surprise
diferent
little
beerings
if
poured
its
a
golden
color
with
a
flowing
white
head
with
light
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
scent
is
very
light
with
hints
of
grass
flavor
was
pretty
good
but
no
real
hops
that
stood
out
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
disappointing
by
my
standards
but
all
in
all
i
was
happy
to
relive
my
youth
i
drank
these
a
lot
growing
up
but
they
are
now
somewhat
rare
to
find
anymore
but
ive
matured
still
the
brews
main
appeal
for
me
is
that
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
the
taste
does
nothing
to
keep
one
from
having
yet
another
one
the
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
scores
still
seem
correct
but
if
youre
just
old
enough
or
not
quite
old
enough
to
buy
the
stuff
it
still
has
that
appeal
that
mystique
very
pale
yellow
in
colour
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
an
odd
soapbubbly
head
theres
a
strange
fruity
apple
perhaps
aroma
to
this
one
along
with
some
corn
notes
there
are
some
bready
malt
flavors
along
with
more
corn
very
thin
bodied
i
found
it
hard
to
finish
even
though
the
bottle
was
so
small
gernerally
yucky
this
is
a
green
8
ounce
bottle
brewed
for
schoenling
by
snyder
intl
brewing
group
of
frederick
md
i
think
sam
adams
bought
the
schoenling
cincinnatti
brewery
the
pour
is
a
dull
almost
cloudy
straw
to
gold
color
a
white
whisp
of
head
caps
it
off
the
aroma
is
soapy
grassy
sweet
malty
corny
not
exciting
flavor
is
sweet
and
grassy
almost
sweetener
type
sweet
the
body
leans
toward
the
syrupy
side
the
aftertaste
returns
to
the
grassiness
as
it
dries
up
just
a
run
of
the
mill
adjunct
brew
with
a
bit
more
flavor
drink
it
cold
i
dig
this
stuff
cool
bottle
cool
flavor
overall
a
very
cool
brew
had
a
pretty
golden
color
with
a
cloudlike
white
head
medium
carbonation
not
much
detected
when
smelled
only
natural
grassy
like
odors
and
even
those
were
quite
light
flavor
was
pretty
good
tasted
like
sweet
cream
corn
that
was
over
cooked
finish
was
kind
of
syrupy
and
slightly
overpowering
with
notes
of
artificial
sweetness
not
bad
though
i
like
to
have
this
brew
every
once
in
awhile
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
have
to
admit
despite
the
nostalgia
thing
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
little
7
ounce
bottle
i
didnt
really
get
much
either
but
i
do
think
more
highly
of
it
than
i
expected
to
even
though
im
glad
that
little
kings
is
still
being
brewed
i
doubt
that
id
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
maybe
once
a
year
if
i
felt
like
reliving
my
youth
okay
so
im
a
sentimental
liar
an
eight
pack
of
pony
bottles
what
we
used
to
call
splits
when
it
came
to
rolling
rocks
or
matts
premium
in
the
late
70s
dull
lessthangolden
color
head
struggles
very
low
and
then
vanishes
completely
very
little
lace
just
a
few
dots
on
one
side
of
a
pilsner
glass
vegetal
aromas
slightly
toffee
but
with
some
definite
traces
of
cooked
greens
light
body
average
carbonation
the
flavor
is
subdued
vaguely
sticky
and
bready
and
sweet
with
a
severe
lack
of
detectable
hops
seems
slightly
seltzery
in
the
close
but
also
seems
easy
going
with
its
light
sweetness
and
little
else
in
the
long
run
though
theres
really
not
much
of
anything
going
on
with
this
beer
the
beer
evacuates
the
stubby
green
bottle
a
limpid
gold
color
with
a
bright
white
modest
creamy
head
that
erodes
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
lace
to
obfuscate
the
glass
nose
is
crisp
and
clean
sweet
malt
dominates
start
is
sweet
and
pleasantly
malted
top
is
thin
in
its
feel
upon
the
palate
finish
is
benign
in
its
acidity
and
the
hops
light
in
their
spiciness
dry
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
7oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
medium
gold
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
that
dies
quickly
theres
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
has
a
bit
of
a
corn
smell
to
it
as
well
no
real
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
malty
and
corny
with
a
slight
burning
sensation
on
the
finish
the
body
is
actually
fairly
thick
the
drinkability
is
ok
as
well
really
needs
some
work
i
started
drinking
this
stuff
at
my
friends
bar
in
cleveland
oh
the
little
kings
lounge
they
were
almost
exclusive
in
their
carrying
of
the
beer
as
far
as
bars
in
the
city
went
doesnt
smell
the
best
but
its
small
size
7oz
makes
drinking
them
easy
the
fairly
potent
ac
5
5
tends
to
creep
up
on
you
after
an
8
pack
of
them
or
so
they
just
started
brewing
them
again
from
a
hiatus
of
a
couple
years
there
was
a
little
kings
red
that
was
around
years
ago
was
dumped
after
the
first
brewery
quit
brewing
them
and
the
rights
were
resold
to
another
company
not
recomended
awww
cmon
guys
this
may
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
a
good
clean
crisp
beer
that
goes
down
easy
i
used
to
buy
these
in
the
cute
little
7ounce
bottles
when
i
lived
in
denver
and
i
could
knock
down
ten
of
em
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
thats
what
made
them
so
easy
to
knock
off
and
with
those
nifty
little
bottles
they
never
go
flat
or
get
warm
i
wish
i
could
buy
them
where
i
now
live
in
arizona
i
found
a
sixer
of
this
in
tulsa
ok
and
i
had
never
heard
of
it
so
i
picked
it
up
however
these
were
12oz
bottles
not
the
7ozers
like
people
have
been
describing
anyway
i
was
kind
of
weary
of
this
beer
when
i
took
a
wiff
it
had
the
smell
of
a
40oz
of
oe
however
after
the
first
taste
i
knew
that
i
had
nothing
to
worry
about
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
i
usually
opt
for
the
darker
beers
but
i
will
drink
anything
however
this
was
suprising
the
appearance
was
light
with
a
white
head
that
left
some
lace
and
the
taste
was
nice
and
light
with
a
big
mouthfeel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
does
have
a
nice
creamy
feel
to
it
and
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
a
nice
creamy
beer
this
isnt
awful
but
i
sense
nothing
to
really
recommend
it
other
than
its
historical
relationship
to
the
old
cincinnati
breweries
a
review
down
the
line
from
masterbruewer
gives
a
great
historic
edge
to
understanding
this
little
brew
for
myself
i
picked
up
a
24
pk
for
10
99
a
deal
to
stock
up
with
it
poured
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
an
average
size
soft
white
head
carbonation
is
medium
but
it
still
fades
quickly
to
a
film
lace
is
not
to
be
found
the
aroma
is
mettalic
and
sulphury
the
taste
is
semisweet
corn
faint
tart
hop
and
faint
on
malt
an
aquired
taste
perhaps
but
not
all
that
bad
its
not
a
big
brewery
beer
but
a
little
bargain
attempt
at
best
a
perfect
novelty
beer
if
you
wanna
get
it
on
with
drunk
college
coeds
and
dont
mind
a
serious
headache
the
morning
after
they
will
drink
this
up
like
wildfire
plus
it
comes
in
a
cute
little
bottle
and
tastes
better
than
ommegang
aghhh
why
does
my
right
eye
hurt
acquired
via
trade
i
guess
when
i
was
afraid
that
i
would
never
see
a
bottle
of
little
kings
on
store
shelves
ever
again
i
figured
i
owed
it
to
the
ohio
brewing
community
to
at
least
try
it
needless
to
say
getting
through
the
seemingly
insubstantial
7oz
was
no
small
task
the
beer
pours
a
rather
bright
yellow
color
with
a
thin
and
quickly
dying
head
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
a
little
musty
but
there
are
some
hops
trying
to
make
their
presence
felt
the
body
is
weak
and
so
is
the
watery
hops
flavor
with
hints
of
sourness
here
and
there
the
finish
is
kind
of
the
last
gasp
in
this
little
guy
i
guess
on
some
level
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
just
not
a
good
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
dark
golden
colour
minimal
head
and
no
lace
an
adjuncty
sulphury
aroma
smells
cheap
mega
corn
taste
some
well
hidden
fruit
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
rough
and
gritty
not
really
creamy
at
all
drinkability
is
low
and
although
ill
polish
off
the
eight
pak
of
seven
ouncers
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
ever
again
this
is
a
poor
beer
this
beer
is
an
acquired
taste
but
highly
drinkable
when
you
know
what
to
expect
color
is
of
yellow
light
gold
close
to
pale
but
definately
not
clear
thin
white
head
of
loose
froth
fades
some
to
a
thin
haze
always
present
and
no
lace
smell
is
all
sweet
corn
and
not
much
else
maybe
a
hint
of
floralness
hard
to
get
past
the
sweetness
taste
is
more
sweetened
corn
and
grains
creamy
and
airy
frothed
malts
very
fresh
and
farmy
like
a
farmers
own
home
brew
with
the
ingredients
grown
in
his
fields
out
on
a
iowa
flat
in
that
fashion
it
has
a
quality
like
no
other
cream
ale
feel
is
a
light
delight
of
creamy
easyness
and
light
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
good
little
summer
drink
i
drank
this
beer
right
out
of
their
little
green
bottles
i
heard
about
this
beer
being
an
ohio
right
of
passage
for
up
and
coming
beer
drinkers
so
i
went
for
it
after
killing
about
5
from
an
8
pack
i
came
to
realized
that
they
werent
so
bad
as
long
as
they
remained
cold
which
was
easy
because
of
the
small
bottles
its
a
pungent
and
almost
skunky
beer
with
a
definite
grainy
corn
taste
or
some
other
adjuncts
they
went
down
pretty
easy
although
not
a
well
crafted
beer
i
liked
it
anyways
another
cincinnati
classic
a
real
survivor
from
the
golden
era
in
the
50s
this
little
gem
was
and
is
a
local
favorite
it
is
not
a
great
beer
on
any
account
but
its
creamy
sense
hop
presence
and
good
looking
gold
color
continue
to
make
it
a
choice
for
many
settings
dont
go
out
of
your
way
but
if
its
convenient
why
not
try
one
murky
light
golden
color
with
a
fastdissipating
head
no
lace
faint
carbonation
slightly
tangy
aroma
of
sweet
corn
with
some
alcohol
notes
taste
begins
with
pronounced
sweet
alcohol
flavors
and
cream
corn
flavors
towards
the
finish
a
little
bitter
hops
appear
overall
nothing
special
although
there
is
nothing
that
offends
for
the
fact
that
it
is
sold
in
a
eight
packs
of
seven
ounce
bottes
at
around
5
texas
i
would
say
its
a
poor
value
for
the
money
this
beer
has
been
hanging
around
the
back
of
beer
refer
for
several
months
it
has
been
cold
and
dark
but
that
has
not
helped
it
much
the
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
head
that
disappates
so
fast
that
you
better
not
blink
or
it
is
gone
the
smell
of
corn
is
stong
as
is
the
taste
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
someone
who
is
wanting
to
know
what
dms
corn
smells
and
tastes
like
the
beer
finishes
quite
sour
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
i
would
have
no
use
for
this
beer
except
as
an
example
of
what
a
beer
is
not
supposed
to
taste
like
colour
was
a
meddark
gold
with
limited
head
taste
was
bordering
on
a
mild
sweet
hops
evident
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
minor
after
taste
ah
the
little
bottle
of
little
kings
this
beer
has
a
light
citrus
taste
to
it
and
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
very
light
flavorwise
but
a
novelty
due
to
the
small
bottles
i
drank
these
while
standing
at
the
bbq
grilling
steaks
and
somewhat
enjoyed
it
little
kings
cream
ale
has
flavors
that
are
assertive
in
nature
the
flavor
that
is
asserted
the
most
is
a
strong
corn
like
sweet
that
would
take
some
time
getting
use
to
for
those
who
are
into
sweet
beer
little
kings
cream
ale
would
be
your
mug
of
beer
no
head
at
all
pale
strawish
golden
odd
nose
and
palate
creamysweet
skunkybitter
awful
on
all
accounts
thank
god
it
comes
in
7oz
bottles
because
anymore
would
have
been
a
chore
not
recommend
at
all
this
has
an
awful
smell
to
it
like
bad
b
o
body
odor
it
has
a
creamy
texture
and
a
sweetish
adjuncty
type
taste
the
taste
is
ok
but
the
smell
is
killing
me
everytime
i
take
a
drink
of
this
i
also
smell
some
alcohol
and
faint
hops
but
the
first
strong
smell
is
of
b
o
the
little
bottles
are
cool
and
at
one
time
i
thought
this
was
a
treat
to
find
not
any
more
genny
cream
ale
is
a
clear
step
up
from
this
this
beer
was
a
very
pale
yellow
color
and
formed
absolutely
no
head
an
aroma
of
grain
and
slightly
of
hops
a
flavor
of
grain
and
not
much
else
i
used
to
drink
little
kings
which
was
common
where
i
was
from
while
i
found
it
better
then
the
more
larger
macro
brews
it
still
is
not
high
on
my
list
clean
slightly
astringent
front
with
moderate
hops
showing
up
in
the
middle
and
holding
through
the
finish
ricecorn
adjunct
flavors
added
a
little
crispness
for
whatever
that
is
worth
very
light
minimal
taste
good
carbonation
really
nothing
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
solid
go
to
easy
drinking
summer
beer
really
enjoyed
this
flagship
from
the
wisconsin
brewery
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
before
very
refreshing
and
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
in
the
middle
of
summer
12oz

poured
into
shaker
pint

good
and
theres
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
crackers
grainy
malt
corn
a
little
lagery
fruit
and
a
hint
of

taste
is

corn
and
fruit
with
a
little
grassy
bitterness
on

mediumlight

abrupt

o
very
much
a
casual
afternoon

party
kind
of
beer
smooth
an
above
average
tailgate
beer
wish
it
was
sold
outside
wisconsin
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
masses
says
cream
ale
but
comes
across
like
a
lager
seems
to
me
more
malt
forward
has
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
that
coats
your
mouth
fairly
bland
other
than
that
over
all
not
bad
light
and
smooth
you
do
get
a
nice
ipa
taste
no
bitter
after
taste
wish
it
was
available
outside
of
wisconsin
this
beer
is
100
times
better
on
tap
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
surprised
by
the
overall
lightness
but
despite
the
lightness
there
was
still
plenty
of
flavor
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
i
thought
i
was
drinking
miller
lite
smooth
beer
with
no
bad
flavors
fantastic
beer
hard
to
find
but
well
worth
it
if
you
are
in
wisconsin
a
great
regular
beer
im
always
in
good
spirits
as
i
open
one
of
these
bottles
good
for
mass
consumption
even
better
at
a
bowling
alley
after
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
brew
is
a
staple
in
summer
sessionables
refreshing
ale
that
tastes
very
similar
to
a
lager
one
of
the
most
pleasant
beers
ive
smelled
lacking
in
anticipated
fruit
flavor
though
overall
b
cant
say
it
does
much
for
me
genesee
cream
ale
for
me
is
the
standard
for
cream
ale
new
glarus
version
is
pretty
much
the
same
other
than
maybe
a
little
head
retention
and
possibly
a
slightly
fuller
taste
than
the
geney
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
nothing
amazing
either
just
a
good
representation
of
a
nice
coiffing
summer
beer
that
i
happen
to
be
drinking
on
new
years
day
this
is
my
to
go
summer
beer
always
a
great
choice
nice
beer
for
a
hog
summer
day
after
cutting
the
grass
if
i
lived
in
wi
this
would
be
my
daily
its
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
right
away
solid
beer
bought
in

brought

poured
from

had
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
nice
creamy
head
with
good
lacing
sweet
aroma
mild
taste
subtle
flavors
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
overall
a
nice
cream
ale
with
a
low
abv
perfect
for
a
lunch
when
you
need
to
keep
working
in
the
afternoon
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
enjoyable
would
be
great
for
summer
nothing
overly
special
but
still
well
made
good
beer
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
me
o
easy
drinking
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
not
think
about
right
up
there
with
hamms
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
but
without
any
of
the
flaws
light
very
drinkable
this
beer
tasted
no
different
than
a
standard
aal
in
my
opinion
did
not
smell
or
taste
any
fruitiness
creaminess
or
corn
for
that
matter
this
is
my
favorite
cream
ale
centered
carbonation
smooth
from
start
to
finish
light
fizz
absolutely
enjoyable

on

can
only
draw
small
cream
notes
honestly
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
i
likely
could
not
tell
i
do
pull
orange
notes
taste
more
like
a
wheat
very
light
and
somewhat
forgettable
overall
this
is
the
perfect
cream
ale
as
far
as
i
know
does
a
really
well
job
of
taking
all
the
good
flavors
of
everything
and
combining
them
into
a
nice
light
and
flavorful
beer
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
among
noncraft
beer
enthusiasts
too
it
is
too
much
like
a
lager
for
my
tastes
but
i
did
enjoy
the
creaminess
i
picked
up
the
malt
with
very
little
hop
balance
though
the
malt
was
not
overpowering
by
any
means
meh
beer
pours
brilliant
and
yellow
with
a
white
head
carbonation
level
is
good
flavor
profile
is
very
clean
almost
like
a
lager
more
than
a
farmhouse
hops
are
subdued
as
are
the
grains
everything
in
harmony
beer
is
very
refreshing
this
is
more
of
what
i
would
imagine
a
farmhouse
to
have
been
like
back
in
the
day
more
refreshing
than
funky
a
nice
easy
going
wisconsin
farmhouse
ale
very
refreshing
nothing
flashy
4
25
overall
definitely
my
goto
beer
when
in
wisconsin
it
tastes
great
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
while
being
leaps
and
bounds
above
most
american
lagers
including
new
glarus
own
totally
naked
the
relatively
low
abv
also
allows
you
to
have
more
than
one
without
too
much
effect
for
a
wisconsite
spotted
cow
is
the
default
craft
beer
it
is
easy
pleasing
and
very
accessible
with
a
very
clean
flavor
while
this
is
rarely
any
beer
enthusiasts
favorite
beer
as
most
beer
enthusiasts
lean
towards
a
more
robust
style
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
provide
to
a
broad
audience
of
beer
enthusiasts
beer
drinkers
and
beer
novices
alike
discovered
this
by
accident
on
a
road
trip
to
wis
glad
i
did
love
this
beer
will
drink
it
any
chance
i
get
ive
always
thought
this
was
a
nice
gateway
beer
i
know
many
people
in
wisconsin
who
would
say
this
is
there
first
full
flavor
beer
overall
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
pours
like
a
normal
lager
golden
in
color
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
kind
of
yeasty
and
citrus
fruits
fairly
bitter
tasting
really
has
flavor
all
around
the
tongue
would
recommend
anyone
visiting
the
south
west
area
of
wisconsin
to
not
only
visit
the
new
glarus
brewery
but
also
the
town
itself
as
it
is
a
charming
swiss
like
town
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
light
and
delicious
a
good
anytime
beer
and
classic
wisconsin
it
is
easy
on
the
palate
and
has
wide
appeal
this
is
light
bodied
and
boasts
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
just
ok
per
style
no
thrills
forgetable
beer
but
serves
a
purpose
for
the
flavor
challenged
drinker
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
overall
this
used
to
be
a
beer
i
mocked
due
to
its
folkloreish
type
popularity
but
now
approaching
it
with
an
open
mind
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
is
such
a
popular
beer
by
the
masses
and
should
be
equally
popular
with
geeks
a
perfectly
executed
cream
ale
should
be
highly
drinkable
with
creamy
decadent
malts
and
a
splash
of
hops
which
is
exactly
what
the
cow
brings
no
longer
will
i
discredit
this
beer
because
everyone
loves
it
which
was
a
ridiculous
thing
to
do
in
the
first
place
but
instead
enjoy
it
often
for
its
truly
wonderful
characteristics
if
this
werent
in
a
new
glarus
bottle
id
assume
it
was
a
local
brew
like
grain
belt
a
little
darker
in
color
with
way
better
head
retention
the
lightness
and
malt
favor
of
the
corn
is
readily
apparent
and
drinks
as
such
i
kinda
hate
to
say
it
given
how
awesome
new
glarus
is
but
i
got
a
lot
of
high
lifepbr
similarities
from
this
one
appearance
is
awesome
but
falls
short
on
flavor
light
fruity
and
vey
and
drinkable
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
little
cloudiness
and
a
thin
head
great
beer
year
round
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
truly
well
put
together
beer
i
see
why
its
so
popular
in
wisconsin
4
20
overall
i
truly
can
understand
why
this
beer
is
the
staple
goto
beer
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
its
nothing
over
the
top
but
easily
any
bmc
drinker
could
switch
to
this
one
as
well
as
be
appreciated
by
craft
beer
nerds
as
well
i
wish
every
state
had
a
similar
fresh
local
goto
beer
of
this
caliber
makes
me
want
to
go
on
a
road
trip
to
cheesehead
country
pours
a
hazy
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
good
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
bread
for
the
most
part
with
a
hint
of
hops
more
going
on
with
the
taste
of
white
bread
with
some
malt
and
a
hint
of
floral
and
corn
perfect
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
with
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
a
good
brew
o
ba
calls
this
a
cream
ale

out

about
this

about

and
straight

nothing
stands
out
to
me
taste
on
this
one
is
good
it
might
not
be
complex
or
bursting
with
flavors
but
its
still
quite
good
its
sweet
like
the
smell
and
a
hint
of
fruityness
lingers
its
quite
refreshing
actually
if
this
one
were
available
in
my
area
i
would
drink
it
more
often
a
low
abv
and
refreshing
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
all
night
this
is
only
the
second
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
the
other
was
a
couple
years
ago
before
i
was
more
knowledgeable
so
i
would
like
to
try
some
others
to
see
how
they
compare

doesnt
look
good
in

is

decent
wheat
beer
or
cream
ale
and
they
go
down
easy
tastes
like
a
slightly
watered
down
hefeweizen
not
bad
for
the
style
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
low
alcohol
content
so
you
could
enjoy
more
than
one
easily
flavors
arent
over
the
top
nothing
harsh
about
this
one
it
drinks
easy
and
tastes
good
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
cloud
like
head
that
dissipates
to
an
ok
ring
the
smell
is
grass
and
hay
corn
and
malt
the
taste
is
the
same
its
creamy
and
grassy
lemon
malty
a
little
spice
and
hop
all
faint
though
this
is
their
signature
beer
but
i
can
think
of
others
from
ng
that
should
replace
this
one
again
in
earlier
reviews
ive
stated
ng
is
an
outstanding
brewery
with
many
fine
representations
of
styles
this
one
is
not
recommended
this
ones
significantly
better
on
tap
than
in
a
bottle
and
if
youre
in
just
about
any
bar
or
restaurant
in
wisconsin
theyll
have
it
on
tap
very
cloudy
closetoopaque
medium
amber
that
looks
a
lot
like
a
wheat
beer
grainy
flavor
with
just
a
bit
of
hoppiness
to
it
its
quite
heavy
and
not
a
beer
id
want
to
spend
a
whole
evening
with
that
said
if
the
choice
is
between
this
and
an
mgd
which
it
often
is
in
the
madison
area
this
is
the
one
to
get
in
a
heartbeat
not
one
of
new
glaruss
finest
but
a
decent
standby
ah
the
true
pride
of
wisconsin
poured
this
straw
colored
cloudy
beer
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
bit
of
fluffy
head
there
was
not
much
to
the
nose
mostly
meyer
lemon
if
anything
this
beer
is
the
king
of
subtlety
you
can
taste
that
belgiumy
wiess
bier
bananna
and
yeast
there
is
some
subtle
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
probably
drink
40
or
50
of
these
things
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
slam
you
taste
buds
with
a
one
two
punch
but
for
a
pleasing
warm
weather
sipper
that
your
mom
will
like
you
cant
go
wrong
d
its
quite
light
and
easy
drinking
but
ive
always
found
that
the
taste
has
worn
on
me
after
a
couple
pours
hazy
straw
yellow
with
fluffy
white
head
and
soapy
lacing
nose
sweet
corn
slightly
grassy
taste
creamy
malt
some
corn
lemon
and
hay
crisp
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
finishes
with
a
touch
of
hops
very
drinkable
not
a
complex
beer
but
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
only
complain
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
not
bad
but
when
i
visit
wisconsin
im
looking
for
a
diffrent
ng
brew
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
sweet
malt
and
banana
fits
the
style
of
a
cream
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
wheatcorn
sweet
malt
toffee
slight
yeast
cleanliness
and
some
banana
overall
a
smooth
good
blend
and
easy
drinkability
i
did
not
get
a
great
deal
of
cream
flavor
but
the
addition
of
corn
is
not
offputting
by
any
means
dgreat
session
really
really
tasty
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
drinkable
fairly
bland
i
could
put
down
a
couple
on
a
hot
day
d
definitely
an
easy
drinker
more
flavor
would
help
things
along
but
one
could
do
much
worse
than
spotted
cow
if
choosing
a
hotweather
session
ale
nice
medium
yellow
color
when
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
thick
head
it
very
light
beer
not
getting
much
aroma
nicely
carbonated
and
you
can
feel
it
bursting
on
the
tongue
has
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
as
well
which
may
sound
a
little
contradictory
but
you
will
understand
once
you
try
one
i
am
getting
a
bit
of
lemon
from
this
nice
for
summer
md
carbonated
light
bodied
feel
with
a
smooth
drinkable
finish
easily
drinkable
could
like
this

throughout
the

of
the

bubbly
dirty
white

aroma
is
sweet
grainy
and
yes
i
can
even
detect
a
little
of
that
corn
sweetness
not
much
though
a
little
musty
too
decent
aroma
overall
pretty
even
keeled
flavor
not
too
sweet
but
it
does
have
some
grain
sweetness
body
is
pretty
full
mediumfull
id
say
some
thirstquenching
qualities
decent
beer
but
new
glarus
has
so
much
more
to
offer
overall
this
is
not
a
very
complex
beer
just
doesnt
seem
to
by
my
style
i
wont
be
having
any
more
of
this
not
one
of
ng
best
offerings
d
highly
drinkable
great
summer
or
spring
beer
sessionable
a
decent
brew
would
work
well
with
almost
any
food
item
as
a
generic
beverage
a
style
that
i
think
is
overlooked
a
bit
nice
treat
but
nothing
to
strive
to
acquire
poured
from
bottle
in
to
standard
pint
yellow
in
color
champagne
like
carbonation
dances
up
from
base
smells
like
sweet
malty
goodness
not
bad
taste
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
of
things
but
no
complaints
overly
carbonated
in
the
mouth
almost
like
a
sprite
that
has
been
in
the
hot
truck
allday
i
know
thats
a
bad
comparison
as
the
sprite
would
be
flat
as
hell
but
it
feels
about
the
same
on
the
tounge
highly
drinkable
despite
its
poor
mouthfeel
i
must
say
far
better
than
any
bmc
out
there
while
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
really
of
note
here
a
good
summer
beer
one
youd
want
after
working
outside
on
a
hot
day
and
want
to
cool
down
with
a
beer
that
refreshes
but
isnt
too
heavy
overall
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
okay
the
flavors
up
front
a
great
but
fade
to
an
unfavorable
stale
sour
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
far
too
carbonated
for
me
to
enjoy
this
beer
edit
i
wrote
this
review
after
a
very
long
day
and
an
epic
quest
to
find
beer
after
having
a
few
more
i
dont
love
it
as
much
as
i
did
at
first
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
that
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
straw
colored
golden
with
a
finger
of
white
soapy
head
smell
is
banana
clovelike
similar
to
a
hefe
but
not
overpowering
like
a
lot
of
hefeweizens
are
the
taste
is
like
a
light
beer
should
be
like
a
good
tasting
macro
beer
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
much
thicker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
extremely
drinkable
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
this
would
be
my
go
to
beer
for
all
mass
consuming
eventsgolf
beer
pong
etc
my
first
beer
from
new
glarus
and
im
not
disappointed
d
an
excellent
warmweather
brew
light
and
refreshing
but
with
enough
complexity
and
flavor
to
entice
you
in
for
another
sip
poured
into
a
pub
glass
omg
this
is
an
amazing
beer
ohio
should
invade
wisconsin
just
to
get
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
is
vaguely
fruity
without
being
overpowering
the
way
leinenkugels
or
sam
adams
tends
to
be
this
might
be
the
mostt
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
i
accidentally
killed
the
bottle
within
about
fifteen
minutes
and
it
was
delicious
i
have
a
friend
in
wisconsin
and
i
definitely
just
gave
him
some
money
to
smuggle
me
back
a
case
a
very
easy
mouthfell
is
at
play
with
spotted
cow
as
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
help
work
the
beer
across
the
palate
because
of
the
mild
taste
of
the
beer
there
is
no
aftertaste
left
with
after
drinking
the
offering
and
the
beer
truly
does
serve
as
a
very
nice
session
beer
very
drinkable
and
smooth
dvery
sessionable
but
im
not
sure
why
you
would
want
to
since
this
there
really
isnt
much
here
d
if
i
could
get
every
keg
of
bmc
replaced
with
this
i
could
die
a
happy
man
d
i
dont
know
the
style
that
well
but
i
like
it
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
couple
of
these
tastes
like
a
fantastic
brew
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
real
nice
low
abv
thirst
quencher
this
is
a
fantastic
gateway
beer
and
is
quite
drinkable
i
dont
think
an
experienced
or
even
intermediate
ba
will
find
anything
new
from
this
beer
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
this
style
this
beer
is
easy
to
appreciate
is
well
done
and
is
ultimately
an
enjoyable
session
beer
very
drinkable
and
on
the
right
day
it
could
be
very
refreshing
ive
just
had
much
better
beers
from
new
galrus
im
a
little
surprised
this
is
their
flagship
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
just
average
to
me
drinkability
these
are
pretty
light
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
sixpack
good
beer
for
parties
or
tailgating
because
everyone
likes
it
and
its
easy
to
drink
pours
cloudy
light
yeloow
with
good
white
head
smell
grainy
malty
not
very
strong
taste
slight
banana
flavor
maltiness
it
is
not
bad
but
i
find
it
a
bit
boring
mouthfeel
is
much
better
though
it
is
rally
smooth
and
creamy
very
well
balanced
drinkability
is
good
edit
after
having
a
couple
more
ive
decided
that
im
not
as
keen
on
this
as
i
initially
judged
its
that
grainy
oversweetness
narsty
i
have
thus
dropped
the
smell
and
taste
by
half
a
point
from
my
original
review
had
this
one
before
in
a
bottle
and
wasnt
too
impressed
at
applebees
for
a
birthday
party
this
looked
like
the
best
thing
available
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
small
white
head
with
okay
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
sweet
with
lots
of
cereal
grain
along
with
fruitiness
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
the
hops
add
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
but
grain
and
fruitiness
are
still
the
dominant
flavors
strong
carbonation
that
doesnt
show
in
the
appearance
almost
too
bubbly
for
me
got
distracted
from
the
taste
pretty
drinkable
though
however
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
i
wouldnt
drink
a
ton
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
with
this
beer
for
me
everything
about
it
is
so
light
and
airy
its
not
bad
looking
but
its
very
light
mildly
hazy
the
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
tad
lemony
and
a
lot
of
light
malt
the
flavor
is
even
tamer
i
dont
hate
it
and
its
possible
that
this
beer
is
quite
good
very
fresh
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
have
preferred
it
served
a
bit
colder
and
its
certainly
not
difficult
to
drink
there
are
no
real
off
flavors
i
dont
know
if
corn
is
as
an
adjunct
grain
in
this
beer
but
it
has
a
similar
bland
favor
to
corn
d
very
high
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
tastes
a
lot
like
an
adjunct
lager
only
a
little
sweeter
and
some
strange
creamyness
recommended
at
least
once
or
when
drinking
quantity
maybe
i
was
just
really
in
the
mood
for
a
cream
ale
maybe
it
hit
the
spot
just
right
but
on
the
whole
i
found
this
one
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
and
a
few
funky
flavors
but
all
in
all
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
if
someone
wants
to
send
me
another
bottle
i
can
see
if
i
find
another
bottle
as
enjoyable
almost
no
head
after
a
few
seconds
even
the
ring
around
the
glass
is
weak
hazy
golden
body
nose
is
mild
to
boring
not
much
of
anything
coming
through
first
taste
was
mint
weird
heavily
carbonated
full
body
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavors
coming
out
not
much
to
really
pin
down
here
maybe
some
wheat
malts
drinkability
very
high
this
is
a
delicious
highly
redrinkable
brew
for
almost
any
occasion
beautiful
pour
golden
honey
color
with
cloudy
yeast
two
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
retention
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
wonderful
sweet
wheat
honey
orange
and
a
little
of
the
trademark
banana
in
every
wheat
ale
obviously
north
american
yeast
hardly
any
belgian
nose
that
you
typically
find
in
wheat
ales
but
then
again
new
glarus
has
always
been
good
at
breaking
traditions
first
taste
is
smooth
wheat
and
mild
yeast
not
quite
as
sweet
as
it
smells
but
certainly
not
dry
either
the
citrus
and
honey
come
out
after
a
moment
and
linger
just
a
little
bit
after
the
finish
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
body
wonderfully
smooth
full
and
balanced
flavor
and
just
allround
delicious
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
wheat
ale
so
far
this
is
not
my
style
of
beer
so
maybe
their
are
some
better
options
out
there
but
i
can
live
without
this
one
ever
again
d
in
the
summer
time
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
very
seasonable
beer
overall
impression
good
session
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
regularly
a
cream
ale
can
be
a
great
beer
see
cape
kiwanda
from
pelican
this
one
doesnt
rise
to
that
level
but
its
not
bad
at
all
this
isnt
the
most
complex
of
brews
for
sure
but
man
is
this
good
maybe
its
the
sentimental
value
to
me
but
i
love
this
beer
just
a
perfect
smooth
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
sweet
and
malty
flavor
with
just
the
faintest
of
bites
at
the
end
slight
bready
aftertaste
drinkable
i
submit
that
it
is
i
seriously
could
drink
this
daily
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
be
happy
this
is
the
quinticential

the
beer
that

brews
its
an
east
drinking
beer
great
for
the
newer
beer
drinkers
i
dont
see
the
appeal
anymore
but
for
oldtime
sakes
ill
have
one
it
pours
a
straw
yellow
smells
fruityish
with
a
little
off
smell
in
there
very
light
flavor
little
wheaty
tasting
not
alot
here
but
its
still
a
good
drinker
for
newbies
this
light
bodied
beer
has
a
creaminess
that
is
hidden
in
the
appearance
and
aroma
however
it
does
feel
pretty
good
in
my
mouth
if
it
werent
for
the
sweetness
i
would
find
this
beer
to
be
much
more
sessionable
all
in
all
not
a
bad
offering
from
new
glarus
and
in
wisconsin
this
is
available
at
literally
every
bargrocery
storegas
stationliquor
store
around
this
is
certainly
a
better
option
than
its
bmc
counterparts
drinkability
low
in
alcohol
and
reasonably
tastyaromatic
this
ones
an
interesting
beast
and
is
sort
of
hard
to
fit
into
any
sort
of
style
making
it
hard
to
therefore
you
know
rate
to
style
i
enjoyed
it
however
and
wouldnt
mind
living
in
an
area
where
this
was
the
idea
of
a
session
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
a
mild
cream
ale
or
if
you
are
just
looking
for
an
allaround
general
drinking
beer
d
i
really
dig
it
a
great
session
beer
im
liking
it
now
when
its
cold
out
but
i
would
love
to
drink
this
all
day
when
camping
or
hanging
out
also
a
great
great
gateway
beer
for
people
wanting
to
get
into
craft
beer
edit
i
forgot
one
thing
i
really
wanted
to
say
drinking
this
beer
from
time
to
time
is
a
good
thing
to
do
because
it
pays
the
bills
making
it
easier
for
new
glarus
to
brew
the
award
winning
beers
we
all
love
so
very
much
such
a
small
price
to
pay
d
the
smoothness
and
lower
alcohol
make
this
beer
drinkable
and
ideal
to
session
i
personally
was
not
too
enamoured
of
the
flavor
though
so
i
will
not
likely
have
this
one
again
new
glarus
really
didnt
impress
me
with
this
one
its
extremely
reminiscent
of
a
lager
i
havent
had
many
cream
ales
but
i
dont
recall
my
prior
experiences
being
similar
to
this
its
above
averaage
but
not
by
much
suffice
it
to
say
it
could
use
a
lot
of
work
in
all
areas
i
wouldnt
say
its
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
when
i
visited
milwaukee
about
six
months
ago
i
had
a
bloody
mary
at
some
random
bar
to
start
off
my
sunday
morning
they
made
it
with
a
mixture
of
about
half
mary
mix
half
spotted
cow
it
was
one
of
the
best
bloody
marys
ive
ever
had
ive
been
curious
to
what
the
beer
actually
tastes
like
on
its
own
ever
since
i
probably
enjoyed
the
bloody
mary
a
bit
more
than
the
beer
itself
but
either
way
itd
make
a
terrific
session
beer
i
view
this
as
a
refreshing
session
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
d
this
isnt
the
best
new
glarus
nor
the
tops
in
terms
of
cream
ales
dont
hate
it
dont
particularly
like
it
bottom
rung
cream
ale
glad
i
had
the
chance
this
is
a
terrific
brewery
noone
can
bat
a
thousand
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
just
a
bit
of
a
bright
white
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
after
pondering
the
aroma
for
what
seemed
about
20
minutes
it
finally
hit
me
hot
fresh
ground
corn
tortilla
chips
man
it
was
like
a
sledgehammer
upside
the
brain
i
knew
i
recognized
the
smell
i
just
couldnt
place
it
then
all
of
a
sudden
bam
this
beer
smells
like
corn
and
tastes
very
much
like
sweet
corn
there
was
almost
no
discernable
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
dry
i
would
rather
have
this
as
a
local
easy
drinker
then
the
bmc
stuff
we
get
around
here
this
could
very
easily
become
a
lawnmower
beer
if
it
was
locally
available
bottom
line
a
good
brew
here
nuff
said
d
this
is
a
nice
cream
ale
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
poured
a
little
on
the
yellowish
side
with
not
much
head
and
not
much
carbonation
very
sweet
smells
which
are
the
malts
kinda
like
homemade
bread
slightly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
the
aftertaste
of
a
little
hint
of
hops
in
there
this
is
a
beer
i
would
call
a
summer
brew
that
you
have
at
a
neighbors
barbecue
party
great
for
a
lawnmower
but
not
my
style
not
much
from
the
flavor
department
dvery
drinkable
a
flavor
profile
that
isnt
astounding
but
very
pleasurable
to
drink
have
had
many
spotted
cows
in
the
past
and
will
surely
have
it
again
in
the
future
when
im
in
wi
nice
easy
drinking
beer
well
done
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
probably
my
favorite
cream
ale
which
isnt
saying
much
overall
if
this
beer
is
available
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
take
this
any
day
over
the
millers
and
buds
of
the
world
just
because
this
is
new
glarus
most
recognized
beer
doesnt
mean
they
threw
a
bunch
of
crap
in
it
not
much
carbonation
light
to
mid
body
decent
beer
i
am
new
to
cream
ales
would
like
to
try
again
it
is
a
really
drinkable
ale
it
is
very
neutral
yet
not
a
watered
down
excuse
for
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
if
you
are
buying
for
a
large
group
and
unsure
of
their
tastes
d
quite
drinkable
a
nice
beer
but
fairly
bland
i
swear
this
tasted
better
the
last
time
i
had
this
perhaps
ill
come
back
to
this
review
and
amend
in
the
future
if
future
quaffs
are
different
thanks
to
my
wife
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
madison
for
me
i
had
this
on
draft
in
wisconsin
and
was
a
little
let
down
because
id
heard
good
things
about
spotted
cow
the
bottle
restores
my
faith
cream
ale
still
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
good
one
for
sure
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
freebie
pours
a
crisp
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
a
noticeable
amount
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
smooth
malt
kick
that
comes
through
stronger
in
the
finish
but
still
overall
a
little
on
the
bland
side
the
beer
is
certainly
crisp
and
refreshing
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
this
one
is
certainly
drinkable
but
id
take
a
lagunitas
sirius
over
this
one
any
day
edit
rereview
had
a
bottle
at
the
milwaukee
airport
1009
and
i
was
struck
by
just
how
creamy
and
perfect
the
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
is
the
fresh
subtle
flavor
fits
perfectly
i
have
upgraded
my
scoring
accordingly
d
honestly
ive
never
understood
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
in
wisconsin
never
been
a
fan
after
mulitple
sessions
its
time
to
put
this
cow
out
to
pasture
this
is
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
hop
centered
beer
drinking
if
you
are
looking
for
an
unpretentious
easy
to
drink
beer
this
one
fits
the
bill
overall
almost
like
a
lager
with
a
excellent
creamy
hop
edge
a
shame
we
cant
get
it
here
in
mi
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
no
lacing
light
malt
grass
and
sweet
fruit
aromas
toasted
malt
flavor
mixes
with
lemon
hops
with
a
slight
biscuit
flavor
medium
body
medium
carbonation
mouth
cleansing
with
a
nice
hop
finish
easy
drinking
yet
another
example
of
new
glarus
greatness
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
md
light
to
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
well
carbonated
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
a
solid
choice
to
spend
an
afternoon
relaxing
drinking
some
beer
but
nothing
that
blows
you
away
conclusion
this
is
my
first
experience
with
an
american
cream
ale
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
theres
not
that
much
to
it
i
think
it
would
do
nicely
washing
down
simple
fare
like
burgers
and
fries
but
might
be
even
better
for
introducing
your
bmc
friends
to
craft
brews
as
its
something
like
a
richer
fuller
and
more
robustly
flavored
american
macrolager
a
little
better
than
bmc
certainly
a
lot
worse
than
most
ngs
out
there
for
a
cream
ale
this
stuff
is
pretty
damn
good
i
havent
had
anything
from
new
glarus
yet
that
i
havent
enjoyed
the
flavor
is
welldesigned
and
tasty
without
being
overly
complex
a
light
lemon
meringue
note
floats
effortlessly
beside
a
backing
of
wheat
cream
and
allspice
very
tasty
for
a
cream
ale
and
the
mouthfeel
is
even
better
light
crisp
with
a
creamy
finish
that
lingers
and
brings
hints
of
lemon
peel
and
orange
creamsicle
perfectly
carbonated
too
new
glarus
continues
to
surpass
my
expectations
delivering
yet
again
a
phenomal
beer
from
a
lackluster
beer
style
when
compared
to
the
vast
sea
of
double
ipas
imperial
stouts
and
barleywines
great
job
d
flows
over
the
tongue
very
easily
leaving
a
very
nice
taste
behind
making
it
easy
to
have
more
d
this
would
make
a
wonderful
session
beer
the
flavors
are
good
but
not
too
in
your
face
pours
a
hazed
glowing
yellow
color
bright
white
head
fades
fast
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
beer
just
a
few
spots
of
lacing
left
behind
smell
is
sweet
lemon
wheat
slight
citrusy
hop
aroma
taste
is
tart
lemon
rind
hearty
wheat
taste
and
just
a
faint
hint
of
banana
in
there
too
crisp
and
refreshing
the
tartness
and
drying
effect
are
somewhat
intense
but
i
like
it
very
tasty
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
id
be
drinking
this
all
the
time
d
very
easy
drinking
the
drink
is
light
the
flavor
is
not
dominant
and
the
alcohol
is
manageable
no
wonder
its
in
every
pub
in
wi
it
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
pale
gold
in
color
hazy
with
a
disappointing
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
lemony
with
notes
of
the
wheat
malt
too
the
taste
is
similar
dominant
wheat
and
lemon
flavors
some
spices
i
cant
name
and
banana
which
i
noticed
more
as
time
went
on
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
a
little
watery
perhaps
it
went
down
easy
though
overall
its
a
good
summer
brew
d
very
drinkable
single
or
session
d
extremely
drinkable
beer
pours
a
superb
hazy
golden
color
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
would
guess
that
it
was
a
heffeweizen
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
behind
a
nice
enough
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
of
some
grainy
malts
and
some
fruitiness
taste
is
fruity
hints
of
apple
and
pear
slightly
spicy
a
nice
hop
undertone
that
doesnt
take
away
from
pale
malts
in
the
least
and
lots
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
medium
bodied
and
quite
delicious
i
have
not
been
disappointed
from
a
new
glarus
offering
yet
not
a
lot
going
on
but
it
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
i
dont
mind
it
as
something
light
and
a
little
different
md
a
bit
sweet
but
enjoyable
just
a
great
session
beer
right
abv
refreshing
fantastic
great
job
dan
drinkability
is
great
especially
on
a
hot
day
you
can
really
knock
them
back
great
crowd
pleaser
to
ease
people
into
the
craft
scene
pours
a
bright
hazy
fluorescent
yellow
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
that
lingers
quite
a
while
leaving
some
delicate
lacing
smell
is
dominated
by
the
light
sweet
malts
and
yeast
with
a
hint
of
hops
mainly
lemony
this
taste
almost
like
a
scaleddown
hefe
with
very
light
malts
and
sweet
grains
there
is
a
hint
of
lemony
hops
in
the
taste
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
a
little
creamy
with
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
fairly
sessionable
ale
that
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
drinkability
is
high
this
is
one
smooth
and
sessionable
cream
ale
nice
balance
of
hops
and
fruit
tones
good
body
and
flavor
the
mvp
beer
of
my
hotels
bar
p
d
seems
light
enough
to
session
but
maybe
a
tad
sweet
for
an
alldayer
the
body
is
light
which
is
spot
on
pun
intended
decent
carbonation
helps
accents
the
corny
and
hop
notes
overall
this
is
limited
with
some
noticeable
off
flavors
with
a
beer
that
is
hard
to
high
them
inoffensive
but
kind
of
boring
too
a
mild
ale
for
those
who
want
a
very
mild
ale
personally
i
need
more
flavor
dlight
and
quaffable
for
sure
a
definite
well
deserved
substitute
for
bmc
beers
i
certainly
would
not
mind
putting
a
few
of
these
back
during
warmer
times
but
not
as
a
all
year
long
brew
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
by
far
a
very
good
and
easy
drinking
brew
try
it
for
lunch
on
a
warm
day
prosit
mk
i
know
that
a
lot
of
folks
from
the
midwest
like
this
beer
and
swear
by
new
glarus
as
a
brewery
having
said
that
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
d
definitely
light
and
quaffable
this
is
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
that
is
nice
during
the
summer
months
this
sample
could
be
old
so
i
will
try
again
but
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
it
has
a
hidden
strength
that
catches
up
with
you
the
beer
is
so
drinkable
its
pretty
easy
to
have
that
extra
one
or
two
and
thats
a
good
thing
spotted
cow
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
12
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
predominantly
of
yeast
and
corn
taste
is
much
of
the
same
the
corn
is
noticeable
as
well
as
the
unfiltered
yeast
pretty
well
balanced
full
bodied
light
on
the
tongue
perhaps
a
little
under
carbonated
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
this
beer
does
no
special
tricks
it
is
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
is
a
great
beer
to
spend
an
afternoon
with
tasted
on
4508
a
great
goto
beer
good
gateway
for
macrodrinkers
and
its
one
of
my
favorites
for
hot
summer
days
it
strikes
a
balance
of
light
body
and
well
rounded
flavor
refreshing
and
pretty
tasty
i
cannot
remember
who
sent
this
my
way
but
thanks
unknown
ba
drinkability
is
good
this
is
not
a
strong
or
rich
brew
and
it
does
well
at
showing
the
cream
character
while
still
showcasing
malts
and
yeast
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
cheers
d
drinkability
scores
excellent
here
as
it
is
very
light
lower
alcohol
and
easily
drinkable
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
crossover
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
and
a
great
session
brew
for
beer
geeks
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
thats
probably
better
suited
to
summertime
temperatures
in
excess
of
ninety
degrees
its
not
often
you
see
a
cowthemed
beer
that
doesnt
turn
out
to
be
just
another
milk
stout
dan
easy
to
drink
brew
this
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
new
glarus
but
its
worth
sharing
with
friends
that
come
visit
regardless
of
the
level
of
discrimination
in
beer
taste
its
not
bad
tasting
but
its
got
a
big
defect
in
it
you
usually
only
see
this
in
lagers
but
cream
ale
is
so
light
to
begin
with
that
every
little
thing
will
be
accentuated
i
cant
really
recommend
it
unless
you
like
fruit
beers
in
that
case
you
might
like
this
one
spotted
cow
is
probably
new
glarus
most
popular
beer
its
a
good
intro
to
craft
beers
a
little
more
flavorful
than
the
macros
but
not
too
intense
to
scare
people
easy
drinking
and
tasty
over
all
a
good
really
tasty
beer
if
you
like
this
beer
you
should
really
try
a
full
on
hefe
weissen
a
below
average
cream
ale
thanks
to
deuane
for
the
sample
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
a
fantastic
lawnmower
beer
or
gateway
beer
its
still
tasty
enough
for
the
seasoned
beer
geek
too
d
its
drinkable
ill
give
it
that
its
very
tame
light
and
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
drinking
water
i
guess
it
would
be
a
decent
option
on
a
hot
summer
day
besides
that
skip
it
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
ligth
with
corn
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
light
malt
flavor
with
a
sweetness
mouth
feel
is
light
body
with
a
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
but
not
very
complex
spotted
cow
reminds
me
of
a
bigboned
pbr
nothing
to
mooo
about
but
if
it
was
available
in
boise
i
would
probably
still
pick
up
a
few
every
summer
just
to
have
around
when
i
wanted
something
quaffable
when
working
in
the
yard
light
to
medium
bodied
and
interesting
i
could
hit
this
one
pretty
hard
any
time
of
year
a
good
session
beer
and
recommended
to
anyone
trying
to
get
out
of
the
bmc
rut
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
and
fairly
minimal
in
the
hop
dept
very
yeasty
almost
reminded
me
of
some
type
of
belgian
yeast
strain
while
not
mindblowing
by
any
means
this
is
a
solid
chugger
recommended
perhaps
my
favorite
brew
been
drinking
it
for
years
and
its
every
bit
as
good
now
as
it
was
then
pours
a
lovely
cloudy
gold
and
smells
slightly
sweet
has
a
thick
flavor
and
feel
perhaps
hops
perhaps
corn
or
a
fine
mixture
of
the
two
slight
fruity
follow
goes
down
extremely
easily
very
very
smooth
have
yet
to
find
a
better
brew
works
any
day
of
the
year
and
with
any
foodsnack
truly
the
elixir
of
the
gods
nice
full
body
probably
helped
by
the
wheat
this
beer
is
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
that
we
try
to
keep
around
as
much
as
possible
my
wife
loves
this
stuff
d
i
cant
really
speak
for
cream
ales
but
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
good
either
it
has
nice
parts
to
it
but
as
a
whole
leaves
me
wanting
more
from
it
pretty
refreshing
in
a
sense
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beer
served
ontap
and
quite
warm
at
dicks
bar
and
grill
hudson
wi
overall
a
decent
session
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
all
the
flavors
are
pleasant
label
says
that
it
is
a
farmhouse
ale
but
this
isnt
a
saison
its
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
but
that
doesnt
fit
either
mouthfeel
is
average
to
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
i
say
it
is
spot
on
not
too
light
but
enough
body
to
make
this
feel
like
a
well
crafted
beer
im
not
too
fond
of
lagers
and
this
one
obviously
has
lager
qualities
but
blending
it
with
an
ale
gives
it
a
nice
body
that
i
feel
combines
two
great
aspects
from
both
types
of
beers
refreshing
taste
and
a
malt
body
to
back
it
up
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
cream
ales
but
this
is
the
most
interesting
one
i
have
ever
tasted
theres
a
nice
subtle
complexity
to
it
that
i
find
interesting
i
wish
more
brewers
would
try
this
overlooked
style
im
drinking
this
after
an
evening
jog
and
im
definitely
enjoying
it
it
would
also
make
a
great
crossover
beer
due
to
its
lack
of
any
aggressive
flavors
12

with

mildly

and

this
is
a
crisp
dry
offering
with
a
hoppy
finish
worthy
everyday
easy
drinking
ale
had
the
pleasure
of
getting
a
whole
bunch
of
brews
from
new
glarus
recently
so
i
have
been
working
my
way
down
the
line
and
this
was
the
next
one
up
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
cream
ales
but
i
figured
what
the
heck
and
decided
to
give
this
one
a
shot
it
poured
a
very
nice
cloudy
and
very
light
yellow
almost
a
white
color
a
large
three
finger
head
of
fizzy
white
lace
formed
on
top
and
then
it
faded
quickly
leaving
behind
just
minimal
lace
on
the
top
but
adequate
side
glass
lace
lots
of
visible
carbonation
was
apparent
the
aroma
was
very
light
and
somewhat
sweet
not
really
too
much
to
pick
up
maybe
some
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
bread
but
that
was
it
the
style
is
not
really
know
to
be
very
full
the
taste
was
very
light
and
refreshing
a
touch
of
yeast
or
light
fruit
graced
the
opening
of
a
very
carbonated
and
light
bodied
ale
this
was
more
refreshing
then
anything
and
it
served
that
purpose
well
a
somewhat
muted
taste
maybe
a
touch
of
sugar
and
almost
a
cola
like
flavor
in
the
back
overall
this
was
not
bad
as
i
mentioned
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
the
best
i
have
had
from
it
with
maybe
the
exception
of
the
terrapin
golden
ale
this
was
pretty
good
though
and
i
could
see
it
used
while
mowing
the
lawn
in
july
kind
of
thing
not
bad
and
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
no
visible
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
and
left
virtually
no
lacing
on
the
glass
there
really
isnt
much
of
a
scent
to
this
beer
i
pick
up
on
some
slight
citrus
scent
and
almost
a
slight
corn
but
a
very
weak
malt
scent
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
no
real
hop
flavoring
to
speak
of
but
i
can
pick
up
on
the
grain
and
lemony
sweetness
going
down
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
nice
and
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
it
is
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
the
drinkability
is
good
on
this
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
cookout
and
just
mowed

not
my

small
thin

this
settles

mild
overall

slightly

not
really
creamy
though
easy
to
put
back
a
couple
pints
having
these
drafts
it
felt
like
being
in
a
speakeasy
pours
a
medium
hazyyellowish
color
a
nice
light
creamy
head
that
starts
nice
but
thins
rather
quickly
faint
lacing
that
really
sticks
around
the
whole
glass
aroma
of
citrus
with
a
buttered
croissant
smell
very
inviting
and
intriguing
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
refreshing
also
possibly
a
little
lemon
zest
as
well
for
a
cream
ale
this
is
towards
the
top
of
the
list
a
rereview
from
having
this
on
tap
while
out
to
eat
a
nicer
establishment
maybe
my
tounge
is
getting
better
or
maybe
the
formula
changed
but
this
is
not
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
the
corn
was
over
bearing
the
taste
did
not
blend
well
with
my
food
on
its
own
it
is
still
a
good
beer
but
with
simple
food
that
should
blend
with
it
it
is
a
no
go
this
concludes
my
new
glarus
sampling
although
they
were
all
solid
beers
nothing
really
stood
out
except
the
bock
pale
golden
color
smells
light
and
sweet
tastes
light
with
a
sweet
finish
almost
like
bubblegum
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
bit
light
this
was
pleasant
enough
but
a
bit
watery
could
have
just
been
the
batch
on
tap
i
only
had
one
glass
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
not
a
bad
brew
12
oz
bottle
brought
to
me
by
a
friend
from
wisconsin
ive
never
tried
a
cream
ale
before
and
was
a
bit
taken
back
as
my
friends
and
i
joked
there
are
real
bits
of
cow
in
spotted
cow
smells
of
biscuit
and
cream
and
tastes
pretty
milky
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
velvety
but
it
was
a
bit
sweet
so
drinkability
was
brought
down
overall
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
thought
it
fit
the
category
well
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cream
so
i
cant
rate
it
too
high
straw
colored
with
good
head
that
holds
up
well
nothing
much
to
note
about
the
smell
can
tell
that
you
are
in
for
a
little
sweetness
a
summer
thirst
quencher
sweet
and
sour
with
no
after
taste
to
distract
you
sweetness
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
corn
just
enough
body
to
feel
like
you
are
drinking
something
decent
goes
down
fast
by
the
pitcher
packs
more
of
a
punch
than
i
expect
and
i
always
forget
makes
riding
bike
home
from
the
memorial
union
terrace
fun
after
work
on
friday
from
the
draught
i
bet
this
is
amazingly
good
beer
to
drink
when
its
on
sale
for
3
a
pint
d
this
isnt
all
bad
but
it
is
a
very
awkward
beer
its
sort
of
witlike
but
its
too
syrupy
sweet
and
heavy
it
needs
to
make
up
its
mind
and
be
a
vibrant
summer
quencher
or
a
yeasty
belgian
brew
its
not
really
either
but
it
did
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summers
day
so
its
not
terrible
cream
ales
are
a
complete
unknown
to
me
judging
from
this
one
id
call
them
extremely
drinkable
only
mildly
exciting
but
great
for
the
summer
and
generally
porchsittin
mellow
i
only
have
more
respect
for
new
glarus
thanks
to
this
beer
and
their
totally
naked
offering
because
what
theyre
doing
is
neither
pandering
to
extreme
gonzobeer
fiends
or
trying
to
garner
mainstream
appeal
they
just
do
it
for
the
love
of
the
craft
and
thats
why
even
their
least
remarkable
beers
come
out
winners
drinkability
is
excellent
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
but
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
d
a
solid
beer
easily
drank
multiple
times
during
the
night
this
is
a
great
anytime
of
the
year
beer
like
all
new
glaurus
brewery
beers
it
has
a
strong
flavor
taste
and
body
those
cheeseheads
know
their
beer
it
has
a
smooth
after
taste
that
sits
well
in
the
mouth
and
is
easy
to
down
in
summer
or
winter
i
was
also
impressed
that
it
tastes
equally
fresh
in
bottle
as
it
does
on
tap
that
is
great
aspect
of
this
brewery
crisp
and
quenching
all
you
really
want
out
of
a
cream
ale
good
stuff
taste
was
good
but
i
kept
wanting
more
from
it
good
flavors
but
only
threequarters
of
what
i
wanted
glad
it
was
a
gift
because
i
wouldnt
buy
again
drinkabilty
is
increased
by
the
lack
of
creamy
body
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
white
head
some
islands
and
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
yeasty
cloves
and
a
light
touch
of
spices
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
yeasty
medium
body
drinkable
a
good
session
brew
for
a
hot
day
recommended
got
in
a
trade
with
jeffkrenner
thanks
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
system
into
my
pint
glass
it
was
a
hazy
paleish
yellow
with
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
in
it
it
had
a
very
small
head
that
was
gone
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
malty
with
lemon
overtones
at
first
it
had
a
wet
grass
smell
like
a
lawnmower
beer
but
it
faded
good
aroma
for
a
summer
beer
the
taste
was
pretty
good
it
wont
knock
you
on
your
ass
with
flavor
but
it
does
go
down
smooth
would
make
a
great
session
beer
or
a
trainer
beer
for
you
macro
friends
overall
a
good
solid
session
beer
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
can
easily
get
your
hands
on
it
4
rrnah
t
y
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
bavarian
kellerbier
i
drank
so
much
of
in
germany
it
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
decent
head
that
diminished
but
did
not
entirely
disappear
it
had
an
aroma
of
corn
and
barley
with
a
slight
yeastinessmustiness
to
it
it
is
fairly
light
beer
with
a
slight
sweet
corn
flavor
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
its
also
the
best
beer
ive
used
for
parboiling
brats
before
grilling
them
i
was
anxious
to
try
this
as
i
was
at
a
crap
bar
on
some
lake
in
wisconsin
and
knew
there
was
only
bmc
there
when
i
saw
the
spotted
cow
sign
i
thought
it
was
a
tease
but
they
actually
served
this
at
this
fucking
shithole
bar
this
one
did
not
live
up
to
my
excitement
over
finding
a
new
glarus
brew
for
the
first
time
however
this
was
a
light
gold
in
color
and
just
a
tad
hazy
nose
was
very
subtle
some
sweet
doughy
malts
and
a
hint
of
buttery
corn
and
straw
taste
is
a
light
malt
sweetness
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
this
one
is
balanced
more
by
the
creamy
carbonation
light
and
lively
mouthfeel
drinkable
especially
when
your
only
other
options
are
bmc
and
jaegerbombs
bottle
courtesy
of
monger
poured
a
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
big
pure
white
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
corn
with
light
diacetyl
is
not
extremely
pleasant
taste
is
dominated
by
too
much
corn
with
a
light
buttery
note
which
is
again
unpleasant
body
is
pretty
full
for
the
style
with
some
great
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
that
i
had
from
this
otherwise
fine
brewery
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
perfect
summer
beer
d
very
drinkable
d
one
id
drink
again
seems
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
summerworthy
spotted
cow
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
cant
really
say
im
impressed
its
about
the
same
as
genessee
cream
ale
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
bland
its
hard
to
make
out
the
grains
or
any
concrete
flavor
you
know
on
a
hot
wisconsin
summer
day
this
would
probably
hit
the
spot
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
a
somewhat
murky
bright
sunshine
yellow
with
a
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
very
thin
layer
no
stickiness
no
legs
not
much
in
terms
of
holding
on
smell
is
very
fresh
clean
lemon
and
floral
odors
very
inviting
yeasty
notes
soft
flavors
on
the
tongue
of
biscuits
grass
and
mild
lemon
aftertaste
is
almost
not
even
there
but
has
a
weak
pale
malt
flavor
very
pleasing
mouthfeel
soft
medium
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
for
a
good
balance
in
the
mouth
i
could
put
a
lot
of
these
down
pretty
easily
i
gotta
trade
for
some
more
of
this
one
for
sure
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin
in
the
body
medium
to
light
in
carbonation
this
brew
is
almost
exactly
what
it
purports
to
be
an
easydrinking
lawnmower
brew
that
conjures
up
a
certain
nostalgia
for
the
rolling
hills
of
wisconsin
farmland
it
will
never
have
the
collectorsitemlets
trade
cachet
of
other
new
glarus
brews
and
it
doesnt
seek
it
this
is
a
brew
meant
to
buy
drink
and
enjoy
in
wisconsin
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
great
on
hot
days
when
ya
wanna
sit
outside
on
the
porch
and
have
a
couple
even
better
if
youre
out
boating
with
friends
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
have
a
cow
d
this
is
a
real
sessioner
light
on
alcohol
without
skimping
on
taste
the
beer
is
going
right
back
on
my
wants
list
ok
not
something
i
am
terribly
interested
in
drinking
more
of
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
are
looking
to
branch
from
the
mainstream
flood
of
commercial
beers
it
is
a
good
gateway
beer
for
maturing
connoisseurs
and
is
a
fan
favorite
of
even
the
most
particular
pallets
d
very
drinkable
perfectly
fit
the
nice
mildcool
spring
evening
while
i
was
enjoying
this
one
highly
regarded
among
both
my
older
and
younger
friends
spotted
cow
by
new
glarus
brewing
is
brewmaster
dan
careys
most
popular
beer
it
is
as
close
to
an
everymans
macrobrew
as
you
can
get
yet
this
fine
brew
has
a
tad
more
character
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
nice
head
and
a
lingering
white
lace
smell
is
fresh
and
lightly
hoppy
and
sweet
taste
is
crisp
lightly
refreshing
and
as
michael
jackson
likes
to
say
moreish
very
light
mouthfeel
but
there
is
slightly
more
there
than
the
watered
down
swill
that
is
consumed
by
the
clueless
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
thanks
nflmvp
for
another
new
ng
beer
to
try
drinkability
all
things
considered
despite
the
average
taste
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
elsewhere
thanks
to
jj21
for
this
sample
toasted
in
honor
of
the
birth
of
monkeyknifes
3rd
child
and
another
toast
in
the
hope
that
he
gets
four
or
more
consecutive
hours
of
sleep
sometime
between
now
and
the
end
of
may
took
from
the
fridge
and
poured
right
into
my
glass
poured
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
small
white
head
comprised
of
big
bubbles
head
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
barely
detectable
more
co2
bite
in
the
aroma
than
anything
else
taste
like
any
average
ale
not
bad
not
great
but
very
drinkable
this
ones
okay
par
at
best
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
deffinate
session
type
beer
would
be
very
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
high
protein
levels
in
the
corn
and
flaked
barley
give
this
a
nice
creamy
feel
while
the
carbonation
may
not
seem
active
to
the
eye
it
sure
does
pack
a
wallop
on
the
palate
sure
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
and
interesting
beer
ive
ever
drank
but
its
very
easy
to
consume
and
doesnt
offend
for
what
it
is
its
a
well
crafted
brew
and
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
they
use
all
local
ingredients
kudos
for
that
yet
again
thanks
to
my
fellow
johns
grocery
asshole
joe
try
if
you
can
it
will
be
worth
it
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
style
drinkability
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
just
not
a
very
exciting
style
excellent
replacement
for
macrolager
but
not
much
more
this
beer
has
become
quite
popular
in
wisconsin
and
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
a
small
brewer
who
does
make
some
very
high
quality
beers
reach
a
large
market
this
is
a
really
great
beer
i
tried
it
at
an
outback
restaurant
when
i
asked
for
whatever
local
microbrew
they
had
on
tap
much
to
my
suprise
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
very
versitile
in
taste
in
that
it
can
easily
go
with
a
good
meal
or
just
by
itself
summer
or
winter
it
is
too
bad
that
you
can
only
buy
it
in
wisconsin
so
if
you
happen
to
be
traveling
through
the
cheesehead
state
make
a
specific
point
to
buy
a
case
or
two
of
this
really
good
beer
would
beat
the
snot
out
of
corona
in
the
cooler
in
the
summer
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
just
a
slight
off
white
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
no
real
sustainable
head
there
was
a
slight
citrus
aroma
to
the
beer
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
mainly
of
citrus
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
tongue
and
wheat
overall
spotted
cow
is
an
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
but
is
not
overly
complex
d
nice
easy
drinking
beer
sessionable
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
about
half
an
inch
of
white
foam
smells
of
hay
sweet
corn
and
the
lightest
touch
of
grassy
hops
tastes
of
mild
bitter
hops
hints
of
citrus
and
then
comes
a
nice
maltiness
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
rather
light
in
the
mouth
but
it
wasnt
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
very
nice
i
would
really
like
to
revisit
this
beer
on
a
warm
late
spring
day
drinkability
not
one
i
thought
i
would
like
based
on
the
characteristics
of
the
style
but
this
is
as
usual
another
quality
beer
from
new
glarus
on
tap
at
diamond
daves
smelled
like
a
lager
actually
very
faint
aroma
anyway
hazy
greenyellow
color
actually
tasted
like
a
lager
also
i
could
not
detect
fruityness
vanilla
or
fun
there
was
some
corn
hints
it
is
a
beer
with
a
full
character
not
a
character
i
care
for
but
it
had
a
full
character
for
what
it
was
no
lacing
poured
out
an
orangegold
color
and
very
cloudy
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
feeding
a
stark
white
head
that
rapidly
diminishes
the
nose
is
very
sublte
a
touch
of
sourness
plays
with
lemon
and
hay
the
taste
has
sweet
corn
wheat
and
lemon
twist
with
a
small
amount
of
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
low
carbonation
with
a
quick
slightly
bitter
finish
received
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
trade
with
the
mighty
nflmvp
big
thanks
steve
i
really
like
the
brewers
claim
on
the
label
that
this
is
a
wisconsin
farmhouse
ale
seems
as
appropriate
an
appellation
as
any
for
a
cream
ale
brewed
with
corn
and
flaked
barley
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
an
active
shortlived
snow
white
head
nothing
too
complex
in
the
aroma
soured
bready
grains
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
scent
on
top
of
a
slightly
sweetsmelling
caramel
malt
quality
sort
of
like
an
uninspired
pale
ale
earthy
bready
flavors
become
apparent
at
first
sip
rounding
out
into
a
sweetish
malt
taste
punctuated
with
mildly
spicy
and
grassy
hops
candy
corn
and
vanilla
sweetness
arrives
at
the
finish
highlighting
the
sort
of
sticky
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
medium
body
seems
a
little
thick
for
the
flavor
profile
thereby
setting
back
the
drinkability
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
get
the
sense
that
it
pays
many
of
the
bills
so
that
we
can
enjoy
such
world
class
offerings
as
the
wisconsin
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
nothing
id
seek
out
again
but
certainly
happy
for
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
it
dits
good
but
different
to
my
palette
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
transition
beer
this
is
an
extremely
popular
beer
here
when
i
first
discovered
it
years
ago
i
was
truly
in
love
it
was
different
it
was
local
it
turned
me
on
to
other
crafted
brews
i
introduced
it
to
friends
and
family
and
they
were
also
blown
away
by
it
now
im
kind
of
sick
of
it
its
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
what
was
once
new
and
exciting
for
this
naive
beer
drinker
is
too
simple
for
me
now
however
this
will
forever
be
the
ambassador
of
crafted
brew
in
my
mind
man
up
this
brew
pours
a
clear
straw
color
the
head
is
twofingers
in
heigth
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
sparce
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
and
corn
the
taste
is
not
unlike
the
aroma
very
corny
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
is
somewhat
silky
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
dont
see
why
so
many
people
think
it
is
so
great
slainte
the
beer
is
good
drinkable
and
oh
so
cool
a
nice
one
to
slurp
down
after
mowing
the
lawn
tending
the
plants
outside
etc
when
in
madison
this
is
my
standby
beer
not
a
great
beer
and
probably
my
least
favorite
new
glarus
brew
but
a
wonderful
alternative
to
bmc
i
know
this
beer
gets
ripped
by
some
but
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
very
well
made
nothing
about
this
beer
screams
out
hey
look
at
me
some
fruit
but
mainly
a
bit
grainy
the
flavor
is
initially
a
tangy
but
overall
not
very
strong
at
all
taste
was
a
thin
mix
of
alcohol

my
first
impression
was
that
this
beer
is
a
wheat
the
nose
hints
of
wheat
it
has
a
light
cloudy
amber
color
and
it
tastes
like
a
wheat
not
as
intense
as
a
true
wheat
carbonation
is
light
starts
as
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
and
finishes
fairly
smooth
and
sweet
moderate
head
that
leaves
little
lace
the
brewer
has
barley
and
corn
in
it
so
i
dont
know
where
the
wheat
overtones
come
from
i
had
this
one
at
a
pub
last
weekend
while
i
was
in
milwaukee
it
came
to
me
with
a
hazy
orangishyellow
color
and
had
no
head
to
speak
of
that
kind
of
scared
me
as
i
drank
it
i
noticed
that
this
one
seemed
rather
light
in
body
i
gave
a
sip
to
one
of
my
buddies
who
hardly
ever
drinks
beer
and
its
michelob
light
when
he
does
and
he
said
it
was
light
my
other
buddy
had
a
sam
adams
i
tried
his
and
realized
that
the
sam
adams
was
much
thicker
and
tastier
than
the
spotted
cow
the
spotted
cow
had
an
estery
aroma
to
it
taste
was
predominately
wheat
malts
but
i
did
notice
corn
adjuncts
in
the
flavor
no
hops
to
speak
of
which
might
have
been
nice
the
finish
is
quite
good
with
a
bready
yeasty
kick
in
it
for
what
its
worth
this
beer
did
go
down
really
easy
and
i
could
easily
drink
another
one
and
more
after
that
it
wasnt
bad
but
not
really
my
style
slighly
hazy
but
not
really
cloudy
medium
yellow
illuminated
appearance
a
couple
of
small
chunks
nice
sheet
laces
yeasty
and
estery
aromas
just
suggestive
fresh
and
not
overwhelming
malting
is
straightforward
a
creamy
sweetness
with
an
underlying
stuffy
fruitiness
tending
toward
apricot
hops
are
minimal
at
best
the
mouthfeel
carries
on
and
finishes
the
flavor
profile
with
more
of
the
same
into
the
aftertaste
id
classify
as
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
pleasant
popular
but
pretty
sweet
and
unremarkable
id
give
session
status
to
this
widely
consumed
product
smell
is
light
clean
and
soft
malts
of
sweetness
with
a
dulling
floralness
of
hops
dotted
through
each
wiff
taste
is
clean
and
creamy
sweetness
of
softly
done
malts
kinda
frothy
grainyness
like
intensely
whipped
cream
malts
or
something
quite
a
appetizing
feel
but
it
doesnt
last
im
afraid
but
the
creamyness
stays
til
the
end
where
it
cleans
up
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
goes
dry
nice
and
easy
clean
and
creamy
little
drinker
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
with
decent
head
formation
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
fruitness
in
the
background
pleasant
and
unassuming
the
taste
is
likewise
sweet
and
malty
with
a
floral
hop
balance
overall
a
very
enjoyable
ale
that
is
also
a
very
good
session
beer
this
unfiltered
beer
looked
much
more
cloudy
in
the
12
ounce
brown
twistoff
bottle
than
it
did
once
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
bright
yellow
the
head
was
fluffy
white
and
not
long
lasting
but
it
left
a
little
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
malt
jumps
out
of
the
glass
and
fills
your
nose
what
a
joy
it
makes
the
anticipation
much
greater
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
aroma
a
sweet
maltiness
grabs
your
tongue
and
lingers
in
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
has
a
slight
creaminess
this
is
a
great
beer
for
pleasure
and
for
a
session
too
bad
my
friend
only
brought
me
one
damn
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
head
with
some
suspended
particles
floating
in
there
it
does
look
appetizing
in
the
glass
almost
sunshinelike
aroma
is
somewhat
yeasty
and
musty
the
taste
is
quite
good
there
is
alot
of
malt
here
which
lends
itself
to
a
slight
sweetness
i
detected
some
lemon
in
here
as
well
this
is
an
easy
to
drink

slightly
hazy
light
lemon

color
as
it
sets

frothy

as
it
evanesces
leaves
behind
a
silky
sheet
of

dominates

and
clean

the
senses

a
slightly
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
quick
fading
white
head
leaves
no

just
a
clingring
and
a
small
island
of
foam
in
the
center
of

no

tasting
with
understated
malts
and
hops
creating
a
light
citrus
taste
very
easy
to
drink
very
light
and
refreshing
this
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
in
the
summer
and
very
good
all
the
time
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
i
was
given
this
beer
by
a
friend
to
try
so
i
am
not
certain
as
to
its
age
clear
golden
color
with
minimal
carbonation
and
some
white
sediment
in
the
glass
the
smell
was
fruitysweet
with
slight
hops
undertones
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
fruity
with
malt
playing
more
of
a
role
without
much
carbonation
the
beer
flows
quite
smoothly
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
highly
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
although
not
my
favorite
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
new
glarus
its
somewhat
cloudy
pale
color
reminds
me
of
a
german
hefe
but
not
quite
the
smell
isnt
very
appealing
spotted
cow
has
a
grainy
aspect
due
to
the
addition
of
corn
in
the
brewing
process
which
creates
a
somewhat
prickly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
day
this
golden
bottle
conditioned
ale
is
quite
a
nice
surprise
the
golden
cloudy
color
due
to
suspended
yeast
gives
off
a
caskconditioned
hop
aroma
initially
ester
flavor
touches
the
palate
followed
by
a
small
smokey
lagerlike
musky
flavor
the
finish
is
light
and
sweet
a
nice
refreshing
ale
this
beer
poured
a
very
light
yellow
color
and
formed
a
very
nice
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
as
it
subsided
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
lightly
of
citrus
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
was
of
citrus
and
a
slight
bit
of
malt
and
hops
the
finish
was
light
and
a
touch
bitter
with
some
elements
of
the
carbonation
coming
into
play
while
not
the
best
representation
of
this
style
it
makes
a
good
summer
session
brew
this
would
be
the
perfect
keg
to
have
at
a
summer
gettogether
it
is
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
is
cloudy
bright
yellow
it
poured
charged
up
but
doesnt
taste
that
way
the
aroma
is
average
at
best
and
smells
a
bit
like
a
macro
corn
adjunct
the
taste
is
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
good
but
not
overbearing
maltiness
and
very
little
hop
bite
on
the
finish
slides
down
very
nicely
would
be
a
great
session
beer
i
like
this
i
dont
think
its
the
most
complex
or
greatest
tasting
beer
ever
made
but
it
is
nice
in
its
own
right
light
fruity
yet
largely
malt
aroma
also
a
grainy
bready
quality
to
it
yellowgold
and
mostly
clear
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
but
leaves
traces
after
each
drink
flavor
is
mild
overall
nothing
particularly
distintive
about
it
malt
taste
with
some
fruitiness
in
undertones
with
mild
hop
presence
in
bitterness
pretty
quick
finish
seems
refreshing
and
smooth
for
summer
but
in
an
ale
way
feels
fully
carbonated
yet
medium
to
thin
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
as
long
as
your
are
not
expecting
to
be
blown
away
the
beer
will
serve
its
purpose
it
a
fashionably
this
beer
is
getting
a
lot
more
popular
lately
in
the
central
wisconsin
area
and
i
am
gaining
a
growing
appreciation
of
the
new
glarus
brewing
company
a
very
smooth
beer
with
a
decent
golden
color
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
very
good
drinkability
if
you
make
it
to
wi
try
this
one
you
will
appreciate
it
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
it
looks
great
im
not
sure
what
a
cream
ale
should
look
like
but
this
one
is
appealing
in
a
tulip
glass
the
flavour
is
well
creamy
it
reminds
me
of
kilkenny
easy
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
and
the
faintest
hop
notes
this
is
a
quaffable
brew
that
would
match
up
nicely
with
a
steak
and
kidney
pie
enjoyable
to
drink
would
buy
again
or
try
on
tap
average
it
is
creamy
and
smooth
a
little
hop
in
the
finish
overall
its
not
a
bad
session
ale
but
nothing
i
would
say
to
be
outstanding
the
aroma
is
muted
and
the
body
is
mostly
grainy
with
a
slight
creaminess
thankfully
not
overbearing
and
a
bit
of
a
sharpness
so
it
remains
quite
drinkable
approachable
but
not
too
interesting
concluding
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
seriously
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
enjoy
o
very
appealing
well
balanced
brew
yes
it
reminds
me
of
cottage
country
though
ive
never
had
a
beer
in
cottage
country
though
i
grew
up
going
to
muskoka
in
the
summer
delicious
brew
fruity
dry
different
from
mainstream
brews
full
of
flavor
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
american
pub
glass
a
dark
gold
brew
just
grading
into
light
bronze
territory
with
around
two
fingers
of
resilient
beige
head
aroma
was
unexpected
and
compelling
mainly
tangy
english
hops
propped
up
by
doughy
sweet
malts
accompanied
by
some
fruity
yeast
esters
that
recall
pears
and
light
citrus
rind
taste
is
correspondingly
fruity
and
reasonably
sweet
with
a
bloodlike
metallic
tang
this
brewery
yields
some
nice
caramel
malt
flavors
and
these
shine
through
here
along
with
nutty
bakers
yeast
unripe
peach
grape
candy
pear
citrus
rind
and
toffee
brittle
the
sweet
malt
flavors
develop
nicely
as
the
beer
warms
up
light
bodied
and
creamy
as
the
style
designator
would
suggest
with
a
semiwet
finish
that
features
more
earthyspicy
hops
and
hints
of
toast
robust
flavors
for
a
cream
ale
and
starts
to
blur
the
boundary
between
this
style
and
an
amber
ale
i
like
my
session
options
less
sweet
than
this
but
recommended
nonetheless
mo
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
alright
but
definitely
too
fizzy
for
my
taste
against
a
lightbodied
malty
theme
and
a
wellattenuated
dryish
palate
this
ale
probably
was
filtered
and
reseeded
with
lager
yeasts
to
undergo
the
long
cold
lagering
process
hence
the
higher
attenuation
level
visàvis
the
malty
and
slightly
estery
flavours
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
all
in
all
this
ale
has
shown
some
decent
quality
and
flavour
integrity
o
decent
ale
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
very
low
carbonation
this
sort
of
goes
without
saying
but
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
o
its
close
to
average
but
has
just
enough
flavour
to
keep
it
semi
interesting
i
might
not
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
but
not
problem
having
it
included
as
part
of
a
mixer
would
also
make
a
decent
option
on
tap
overall
an
easy
drinking
cream
ale
by
muskoka
i
enjoyed
the
robust
flavours
in
this
brew
this
is
definitely
better
than
most
cream
ales
that
i
have
sampled
overall
im
not
to
impressed
but
then
again
cream
ales
are
not
my
favourite
i
find
it
overly
hopped
and
not
much
flavour
beyond
that
also
too
bad
my
first
ontario
microbrew
was
basically
a
west
coast
ale
overall
better
than
the
popular
cream
ales
ive
tried
from
my
province
o
a
great
light
choice
moderately
flavoured
not
overly
thin
a
good
everyday
choice
for
the
discerning
drinker
light
bodies
not
too
much
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
very
smooth
goes
down
nice
o
an
interesting
beer
flavourful
but
not
bold
and
aggressive
creamy
maltiness
the
bitterness
lasts
a
little
too
long
for
my
taste
a
decent
ale
good
with
fishn
chips
o
i
am
just
in
love
with
this
i
inhaled
a
six
pack
in
almost
one
sitting
i
just
love
this
its
sonething
i
could
drink
forever
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
this
would
be
great
for
one
of
those
hot
summer
days
overall
not
a
bad
revisit
but
nothing
outstanding
this
brewery
shines
with
their
newer
mad
tom
ipa
and
the
seasonal
releases
this
beer
was
one
of
the
original
lineup
mediorce
beers
they
produced
before
stepping
up
the
craft
experiments
recently
draft
had
a
good
amount
of
head
and
it
was
a
nice
amber
color
could
smell
a
little
bit
of
the
cream
but
it
was
the
tatse
where
the
cream
came
through
first
beer
from
muskoka
brewery
and
the
establishment
did
not
have
much
on
tap
i
rate
this
as
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
is
standing
out
to
me
oday
had
the
beer
a
coule
of
days
ago
good
to
add
a
new
beer
to
my
list
copperamber
colour
white
head
and
light
lace
smell
is
of
biscuity
and
cracker
like
malt
grainy
earthiness
some
lemony
scents
as
well
taste
is
of
biscuity
sweet
cracker
like
malt
light
hoppy
bitterness
follows
lemon
citrus
notes
aftertaste
is
biscuity
with
some
light
hop
as
well
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
lush
at
points
lightmedium
carbonation
good
feel
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
these
guys
make
much
more
interesting
options
that
i
would
pick
up
before
this
i
would
drink
this
again
if
offered
but
it
wont
see
much
time
in
my
fridge
o
a
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
session
beer
i
was
surprised
by
the
character
of
this
beer
i
had
low
expectations
going
in
but
found
this
to
be
a
nice
easydrinker
with
some
pleasant
english
qualities
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
afficionado
by
far
the
most
agreeable
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
highly
sessionable
and
enjoyable
all
around
normally
i
avoid
cream
ales
as
i
generally
find
them
bland
but
this
one
is
nothing
of
the
sort
and
is
definitely
something
ill
come
back
to
good
carbonation
and
drinkability
overall
not
outstanding
but
certainly
enjoyable
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
overall
easy
drinking
mildly
flavorfull
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
certainly
nothing
profound
in
the
beer
world
o
a
decent
cream
ale
that
is
certainly
sessionable
od
meh
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
after
the
rebranding
nothing
too
interesting
and
not
worth
the
2
65
it
cost
at
all
maybe
better
in
the
bottle
but
i
wasnt
willing
to
take
a
shot
on
the
whole
sixer
easy
to
drink
and
has
flavour
but
not
overly
flavourful
or
tasty
overall
this
is
a
beer
for
the
person
who
is
just
getting
into
craft
beers
the
one
who
is
used
to
drinking
bmc
all
day
because
this
is
not
far
off
from
an
adjunct
lager
or
something
along
those
lines
this
beer
does
not
really
have
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
any
aspect
the
smells
are
muted
although
a
lot
better
than
the
taste
and
speaking
of
the
tastes
they
are
so
one
dimensional
and
boring
this
beer
just
screams
fail
personally
didnt
enjoy
it
but
ill
chalk
that
one
up
to
having
my
taste
buds
spoiled
by
amazing
american
craft
more
citrus
notes
along
with
the
aforementioned
breadiness
through
and
through
with
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
medium
light
weight
on
the
palate
this
has
got
to
be
a
new
recipie
outstanding
for
a
cream
ale
top
tier
within
the
cream
ale
style
category
dpretty
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
and
its
a
great
choice
when
you
cant
decide
what
to
get
at
the
beer
store
d
this
wouldnt
be
hard
honestly
to
make
a
go
to
beer
for
something
reasonably
light
not
overpowering
flavor
wise
nor
carbonation
wise
this
would
be
a
very
good
example
of
a
starter
ale
for
someone
trying
to
expand
out
of
macro
lager
ill
probably
pick
this
up
again
sometime
drink
it
is
definitely
a
step
above
the
basic
adjunct
lager
but
its
nothing
spectacular
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
i
wish
i
could
buy
it
in
northern
illinois
saw
this
and
was
unfamiliar
with
it
so
i
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
a
go
and
although
not
a
bad
beer
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
soon
overall
this
is
clean
refreshing
beer
nothing
to
complex
but
has
some
decent
features
i
consider
this
a
good
mediocre
clear
and
orangeamber
with
an
inch
of
light
beige
foam
sticky
clumpy
lace
with
good
head
retention
looks
nice
very
mild
aroma
biscuity
malts
light
honey
with
a
hint
of
citrus
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
more
emphasis
but
not
a
lot
on
fruity
citrus
and
earthy
hops
malt
flavours
were
light
as
was
the
bitterness
texture
was
alright
medium
to
light
in
body
with
average
carbonation
decent
overall
but
quite
average
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
smooth
cream
ale
there
are
very
few
heavy
beers
i
enjoy
that
dont
feel
heavy
drinking
them
such
as
rickards
red
and
now
this
beer
is
one
of
them
this
one
will
be
in
my
fridge
as
one
of
my
go
to
regular
drinking
beers
d
pretty
tasty
nothing
completely
memorable
but
nothing
overly
offensive
it
came
out
a
copperorange
colour
with
nice
white
head
good
lacing
on
the
glass
i
immediately
smell
more
hops
than
i
remember
floral
hops
and
biscuit
malt
taste
has
good
level
of
bitterness
for
the
style
i
think
the
beer
has
gotten
a
lot
better
since
i
last
tried
this
nice
carbonation
level
good
drinkability
as
i
ordered
a
2nd
pint
right
away
generally
cream
ale
is
a
fancier
more
marketable
way
of
saying
plain
ordinary
featureless
beer
but
in
this
case
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
something
rather
distinct
while
i
appreciate
that
i
cant
say
that
it
terribly
worked
for
my
tastes
still
its
reassuring
to
know
that
this
brewery
takes
pride
in
offering
characterful
confident
quality
products
473ml
can
from
the
clarke
dundas
lcbo
pours
a
deep
amber
gold
with
a
thin
strip
of
bubbles
that
dissipates
to
nothing
despite
an
aggressive
pour
no
lacing
here
smell
is
brown
sugar
toasty
biscuit
toffee
sweetness
and
apple
pie
taste
is
pale
and
caramel
malts
mild
fruitiness
pear
skin
vaguely
spicy
and
bitter
hops
drying
chalky
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
side
of
medium
sorta
creamy
but
not
really
juicy
silkiness
with
a
subtle
hop
bite
midway
parched
finish
more
apple
on
the
cough
nothing
crazy
but
tasty
and
drinkable
enough
for
me
to
purchase
now
and
then
underrated
if
you
ask
me
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
i
mean
it
seems
torn
between
trying
to
be
a
flavorful
ale
and
a
more
generic
offering
id
be
willing
to
try
some
other
offerings
but
this
one
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
no
troubles
here
i
dont
know
how
much
this
comes
off
as
a
cream
ale
its
more
like
a
pretty
decent
pale
ale
leaning
towards
being
a
cream
ale
though
it
would
probably
be
quite
nice
on
nitrotap
id
be
happy
to
find
this
on
tap
somewhere
quite
similar
to
the
other
ocb
offerings
fairly
wellbrewed
but
lacking
in
character
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
pretty
uninteresting
hopefully
these
beers
converted
some
molson
labatt
and
sleeman
fans
away
from
macro
swill
and
onto
some
fresh
local
decently
made
brews
like
these
all
were
better
than
their
bigbrewery
counterparts
anyhow
it
pours
a
rich
amber
darker
than
i
had
expected
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
left
much
lacing
the
carbonation
is
quite
evident
in
the
beer
constantly
cascading
upwards
the
beers
nose
is
quite
light
with
an
earthy
undertone
and
no
hop
although
there
is
a
biscuity
malt
the
beer
tastes
of
the
malt
with
no
major
hop
character
with
a
little
sweetness
and
a
slightly
offputting
aftertaste
that
only
seems
to
linger
if
you
let
it
by
not
sipping
constantly
certainly
a
cream
ale
with
a
light
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
and
could
easily
be
a
sessionable
beer
libation
mediocre
in
all
ways
neither
impressive
nor
flawed
very
sessionable
as
there
is
no
serious
alcohol
or
flavor
presence
to
overwhelm
all
in
all
a
decent
cream
ale
which
is
normally
not
a
style
im
terribly
fond
of
not
something
ill
purchase
too
often
but
never
something
to
turn
down
very
sessionable
overall
a
pretty
straightforward
beer
i
could
see
it
being
decently
sessionable
for
someone
else
not
me
mouthfeel
smooth
lightly
creamy
and
refreshingly
watery
higher
carbonation
as
expected
for
a
cream
ale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
nice
cream
ale
and
im
not
a
big
cream
ale
fan
its
particularly
good
with
food
after
tasting
it
for
a
bit
i
tried
it
with
lunch
eggs
and
toast
and
was
quite
happy
with
the
result
the
beer
stood
up
to
the
food
and
complemented
it
nicely
i
probably
wont
search
it
out
but
id
happily
drink
this
again
its
worth
a
try
it
doesnt
suck
an
inoffensive
easydrinking
session
ale
with
a
pleasing
hop
kick
to
boot
in
the
ontario
tradition
of
mild
englishstyle
ales
awakened
to
the
possibilities
inherent
in
new
world
hops
light
bodied
and
spritzy

little
bit
on
the
watery
side
a
thirst
quencher
for
a
hot
summers
day
grain
and
hop
again
to
taste
but
without
the
metal
of
the
aroma
passably
good
could
stand
a
bit
more
presence
a
cut
above
a
macro
d
fairly
easy
drinking
well
balanced
and
decently
tasty

brew
pours

clear

thick
and

nothing
anyone

about

its
pretty
disappointing
in
terms
of
character
very
refreshing
simple
beer
i
tried
this
beer
on
april
30
2008
after
purchasing
an
assorted
6
pack
of
ontario
craft
brews
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
out
a
beautiful
translucent
rusty
red
colour
with
a
generous
offwhite
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
grainy
malt
with
some
hoppy
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
slightly
creamy
with
a
sour
feel
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
the
flavour
is
roasted
malt
some
grassy
malt
and
little
hoppy
bitterness
decent
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
too
carbonated
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
i
am
under
the
impression
that
this
brew
has
changed
a
couple
times
over
the
years
but
for
the
best
a
decent
cream
ale
for
sure
but
the
hefty
price
tag
might
turn
people
away
49
95
for
24
bottles
still
a
good
summertime
brew
and
worth
checking
out
bottle
from
the
lcbo
this
beer
did
not
live
up
to
my
hopes
both
the
pour
and
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
lager
its
a
golden
colour
with
a
very
minimal
white
head
while
the
aroma
is
a
subdued
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
grass
the
taste
too
be
frank
is
extremely
disappointing
all
i
can
taste
is
malt
and
grain
with
the
creaminess
only
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
texture
on
the
palate
but
a
beer
needs
a
lot
more
than
that
my
wife
tasted
it
and
agreed
saying
well
at
least
its
better
than
a
blue
or
canadian
unfortunately
thats
all
i
can
say
about
a
beer
i
really
wanted
to
like
overall
a
solid
offering
of
the
admittedly
few
cream
ales
ive
tried
this
one
is
a
favourite
of
mine
a
great
classic
pre50s
canadian
cream
ale
true
to
style
and
fresh
tasting
dark
gold
copper
with
a
white
pristine
head
however
the
foam
quickly
disipates
leaving
just
a
thin
ring
of
film
smells
a
bit
of
citrus
candy
bread
and
caramel
even
a
bit
of
golden
delicious
apples
interesting
taste
is
quite
simple
lightly
sweet
at
first
with
a
definite
malt
backbone
their
is
a
subdued
apple
and
lemon
tartness
with
some
caramel
sweetness
almost
a
candy
apple
flavour
finishes
slightly
earthy
and
bitter
the
finish
is
definitely
the
best
part
crisp
and
lighty
carbonated
making
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
session
beer
and
quite
nice
a
cottage
beer
notes
good
cream
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
very
straightforward
and
unadventurous
easy
to
drink
bottle
poured
a
yellowish
ale
with
a
nice
smooth
head
with
average
retention
creamy
palate
with
nice
floral
malt
and
low
hops
presence
body
is
slightly
above
average
overall
this
is
above
your
run
of
the
mills
ontario
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
isnt
a
great
beer
either
an
average
beer
but
likely
reformulated
since
these
early
reviews
smell
originally
malty
and
fruity
then
plain
after
warming
up
to
room
temperature
short
lived
head
creamy
and
malty
with
a
spot
of
fruit
ok
with
dinner
at
the
end
of
a
summer
day
in
search
of
a
truly
good
canadian
beer
i
was
delighted
to
see
a
sign
for
this
beer
as
i
was
passing
through
the
muskokas
the
search
goes
on
the
color
was
promising
a
nice
dark
copper
but
the
promise
wasnt
kept
this
inst
an
awful
drink
theres
just
nothing
worth
noting
about
it
not
much
of
a
smell
no
distinct
taste
just
another
boring
canadian
beer
eh
ok
colour
is
a
deep
golden
and
it
does
have
a
slight
glass
cling
however
modest
sorry
this
stuff
is
terrible
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
o
enjoyable
but
not
a
beer
to
rejoice
over
having
said
that
i
had
several
of
them
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
smell
is
full
of
malt
sweetness
with
light
citrus
orange
peel
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
with
hints
of
sweet
cream
from
the
malt
and
then
a
nice
bite
from
the
citrus
hops
well
balanced
and
easily
enjoyable
nothing
about
this
ale
jumps
out
at
you
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
ends
very
watery
almost
flat
one
and
done
for
me
overall
this
is
hot
weather
bear
and
lawnmower
beer
it
has
just
enough
tiny
peaks
of
distinctive
flavor
where
you
are
ok
with
it
as
you
go
thru
the
pint
terrific
structure
but
i
dont
buy
beer
to
just
look
at
it
had
half
the
pint
alone
then
had
the
rest
with
a
simple
grilled
burger
which
completely
dominated
the
beer
to
the
point
where
i
could
have
been
drinking
water
lacks
the
richness
of
a
true
cream
ale
and
intensity
of
flavor
but
nothing
you
will
hate
either
accept
it
if
offered
one
but
dont
seek
this
out
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
with
a
medium
lasting
white
head
aroma
and
taste
has
some
citrus
lemon
fruity
notes
biscuit
malt
yeast
with
some
citrus
floral
hops
notes
palate
is
nice
medium
body
crisp
with
lively
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
biscuit
malt
fruity
with
some
citrus
and
lemon
flavor
some
light
tartness
and
a
bit
of
spicy
citrus
floral
hops
for
balance
overall
a
good
crisp
and
refreshing
summer
style
ale
o
not
bad
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
there
are
better
out
there
but
its
worthy
of
a
glass
i
have
another
one
of
these
that
i
will
try
later
and
if
its
different
i
will
edit
my
review
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
dont
know
how
its
considered
a
cream
ale
though
it
has
the
texture
but
not
the
flavor
o
forgettable
like
um
cant
think
of
his
name
brown
hair
glasses
had
a
beard
he
definitely
had
a
beard
you
know
who
i
mean
anyway
hooker
is
capable
of
making
better
beer
than
this
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
over
anything
else
in
their
lineup
o
the
green
grape
white
vinous
character
is
a
bit
onesided
but
drinks
easy
overall
this
beer
isnt
good
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
really
dont
care
for
this
pours
with
three
finger
head
has
slight
skunky
aroma
and
taste
started
the
pour
down
the
side
and
the
color
looked
very
promising
until
the
head
started
to
form
takes
a
long
time
for
it
to
settle
leaving
a
slight
orange
tan
tint
to
the
head
i
liked
the
unfiltered
appearance
for
this
blonde
ale
100
beer
club
was
eager
to
try
and
left
disappointed
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
its
a
good
selection
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
one
doesnt
do
much
for
me
its
a
very
average
beer
in
all
categories
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
a
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
but
their
isnt
much
more
to
offer
its
a
shame
because
i
would
love
to
order
a
blonde
hooker
every
now
and
again
12oz
bottle
pours
a
semimurky
dark
yellow
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
aroma
is
tangy
with
some
breadiness
slight
bit
of
hops
taste
is
more
of
that
tangy
bread
flavor
small
amount
of
hop
flavor
hard
to
pick
up
on
too
much
else
since
the
tangy
flavor
dominates
hints
of
citrus
lightly
carbonated
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
overall
nothing
special
no
need
to
revisit
this
one
pours
a
hazy
yellow
mustard
color
small
head
fairly
good
lacing
has
a
sharp
start
taste
but
very
smooth
finish
a
full
bodied
beer
average
drinkability
would
probably
try
again
but
not
as
my
first
choice
for
what
this
is
its
not
bad
but
also
not
great
character
either
pours
a
very
very
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
immediately
recedes
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
anything
behind
the
nose
carries
a
very
light
amount
of
grain
and
straw
nothing
too
much
else
the
flavor
is
light
grain
and
straw
theres
a
touch
of
very
light
hopping
but
really
not
all
that
much
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
okay
d
well
this
one
is
hard
to
judge
it
has
almost
certainly
gone
bad
but
in
a
way
that
seems
to
have
made
it
better
than
it
probably
was
when
it
was
fresh
it
has
become
just
slightly
sour
and
the
herbal
spicy
hops
work
nicely
with
everything
else
i
know
that
this
isnt
what
a
blonde
ale
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
it
actually
makes
a
pretty
nice
farmhouse
ale
i
guess
my
conclusion
has
to
be
if
you
buy
thomas
hooker
blonde
age
it
for
a
while
and
it
will
turn
into
a
pretty
decent
saison
overall
an
all
right
beer
but
nothing
blowing
me
away
better
beers
for
the
price
but
a
decent
offering
for
the
blonde
cream
nonetheless
medium
effervescence
medium
body
leaning
fuller
some
vanilla
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
good
malthop
balance
a
decent
beer
hopefully
better
on
tap
nothing
makes
it
stand
out
it
looks
good
enough
at
first
glance
a
nice
golden
yet
thin
looking
pour
with
little
head
it
is
an
easy
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
lack
of
overall
taste
i
imagine
i
would
have
enjoyed
quaffing
this
down
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summers
day
it
is
crisp
and
light
cheers
golden
with
a
small
white
head
lagerish
smells
with
the
slightest
hint
of
vinegar
tastes
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
again
with
a
hint
of
vinegar
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
acid
very
thin
on
the
mouth
this
beer
is
very
different
while
it
tastes
like
a
lager
it
has
a
tingle
on
the
mouth
and
some
different
flavors
going
on
its
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
and
i
probably
wont
voluntarily
purchase
another
hm
its
usually
blonde
hooker
not
hooker
blonde
honestly
that
one
made
me
laugh
pretty
decently
when
i
thought
of
it
it
pours
a
bright
gold
with
an
intimation
of
haze
maybe
more
of
a
rumor
and
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
bright
corn
syrup
wheat
and
a
very
light
dash
of
coriander
the
taste
ramps
up
the
coriander
adding
some
lemon
zest
and
cardamom
while
maintaining
the
slight
wheatiness
and
keeping
the
corn
syrup
to
a
necessary
minimum
the
body
is
decidedly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
refreshing
feel
overall
a
nice
bit
o
summery
goodness
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
spritz
id
describe
this
as
a
floral
if
a
little
grainy
malt
flavor
theres
light
hop
providing
some
balance
particularly
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
however
is
brief
pours
a
spritzy
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
nice
cap
of
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
brings
a
suprising
amount
of
grassy
hops
with
notes
of
pale
straw
white
bread
taste
again
suprises
with
a
definite
grassy
and
earthy
hop
presence
over
the
pale
strawlike
backbone
hints
of
white
bread
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
level
a
nice
suprise
great
warm
weather
drinker
i
like
the
thomas
hooker
brand
and
these
guys
do
a
nice
job
this
blonde
ale
is
fairly
generic
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
d
semilight
it
does
have
a
noticeable
body
and
density
poured
an
orangish
golden
color
with
1
white
head
that
quickly
disapates
it
almost
smells
more
like
a
wheat
beer
but
not
exactly
the
taste
is
a
little
bready
with
slight
undertone
of
hops
kinda
bland
higher
carbonation
thin
mouthfeel
is
a
decent
summer
brew

standard
pint
glass
cloudy
yellow
body
thin
white
head
slight
smell
of
citrus
though
faint
to
the
point
of
nonexistence
taste
was
decent
for
a
blonde
ale
lightly
hopped
with
a
hint
of
citrus
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
but
not
really
watery
it
had
just
enough
body
for
a
blonde
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
or
while
eating
an
appetizer
like
i
was
easily
drinkable
d
a
nice
light
summer
beer
a
lot
of
bars
in
my
area
that
have
crap
on
tap
will
have
this
one
because
it
is
very
local
so
its
a
safe
goto
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
not
sweet
and
no
aftertaste
just
refreshingly
clean
d
not
bad
though
i
guess
i
dont
get
the
differences
between
a
cream
ale
and
a
blonde
ale
though
i
do
not
detect
any
hops
in
the
finish
so
perhaps
thats
why
this
is
a
cream
ale
a
very
approachable
beer
best
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
d
meh
not
my
favorite
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
might
be
even
better
poured
a
light
decently
carbonated
gold
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
very
thin
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
smell
was
decidedly
sweet
honey
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
confirmed
the
smell
with
little
hop
balance
and
a
finish
that
was
hard
to
characterize
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
carbonated
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
if
it
had
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
a
texture
to
match
d
very
high
especially
since
it
was
so
light
and
creamy
drinkability
was
good
theres
nothing
here
to
stop
you
from
sessioning
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
nice
cream
ale
just
enough
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
d
this
beer
was
a
bit
disappointing
definitely
a
step
up
from
your
typical
macro
lager
but
lacks
any
depth
of
flavor
on
tap
at
bdl
pours
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
smells
of
light
slightly
sweet
malt
followed
by
faint
floral
hops
without
much
else
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
again
light
grain
here
the
hops
barely
make
an
appearance
characterless
and
almost
flavorless
save
for
the
lingering
sweet
finish
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
even
if
its
not
harsh
and
incredibly
offensive
the
pervasive
blandness
gives
me
no
desire
to
drink
it
this
beer
sucks
definitely
drinkable
this
beer
had
good
taste
good
finish
and
was
a
nice
clean
ale
cream
ale
im
not
so
sure
of
that
descriptor
for
the
style
this
seems
like
a
pretty
standard
run
of
the
mill
blonde
ale
to
me
with
some
slight
deviations
it
pours
a
nice
reasonably
clear
blondish
golden
color
with
not
much
head
and
zero
lacing
the
nose
is
big
time
citrus
with
a
malty
under
belly
the
smell
is
nice
and
has
none
of
the
metallic
or
tinny
qualities
that
are
common
with
the
style
the
taste
has
a
very
slight
lemony
zing
at
the
front
end
but
this
segues
quite
nicely
into
a
more
malty
and
bready
almost
doughy
flavor
there
is
a
grassiness
to
the
beer
a
slight
lemony
and
spiced
bite
but
this
is
very
subtle
and
it
is
mollified
somewhat
by
the
honeyed
qualities
that
emerge
as
the
beer
settles
this
is
quite
a
smooth
blonde
ale
that
goes
down
easy
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
it
is
light
bodied
refreshing
reasonably
carbonated
nothing
overly
challenging
on
the
palate
and
a
good
summer
type
ale
when
the
weather
gets
steamy
drinkability
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
sessionable
lawn
mower
beer
a
refined
budweiser
that
is
more
tastyi
also
think
i
am
drinking
a
lager
i
like
more
complex
beers
but
this
is
good
for
the
style
drinkability
overall
on
a
almost
60
degree
day
in
new
england
this
beer
felt
like
it
was
painted
with
the
picture
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
on
a
warmer
day
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
aroma
is
very
fresh
of
sweet
hay
and
hops
flavor
has
mild
bitterness
but
is
above
all
else
drinkable
recommended
the
aroma
has
corn
plastic
yeast
dried
hay
and
fresh
cut
grass
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
really
thin
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
it
has
qualities
that
i
dont
like
but
somehow
it
manages
to
be
drinkable
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
with
a
white
head
weak
retention
a
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
dry
an
even
balance
of
pale
malt
and
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
similar
and
interesting
in
their
development
first
i
got
a
dry
grain
flavor
soon
followed
by
the
floral
hops
bitterness
and
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
almost
right
upon
each
other
the
balance
was
superb
the
body
was
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
lively
without
being
prickly
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
only
they
could
make
it
look
better
but
flavor
wise
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
very
sessionable
a
bright
gold
pour
with
a
frothy
but
short
lived
white
foam
nice
malty
nose
with
some
fruity
notes
and
some
hops
a
little
bit
of
hay
tastes
of
sweet
malts
honey
some
weak
hops
sweet
grains
creamy
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
thanks
for
the
bottle
john
i
had
this
on
tap
with
dinner
in
new
haven
the
beer
was
clear
golden
yellow
with
almost
no
head
maybe
a
couple
millimeters
worth
in
terms
of
smell
and
taste
this
beer
had
everything
i
expected
and
wanted
out
of
it
but
there
isnt
much
to
express
in
a
cream
ale
this
was
on
the
sweet
side
and
maltier
than
it
was
hoppy
just
an
easydrinking
craft
beer
thats
perfect
with
a
bbq
or
drinking
in
your
backyard
or
at
a
restaurant
in
new
haven
thomas
hooker
blonde
ale
is
listed
as
a
cream
ale
interesting
anywho
its
a
little
bland
and
boring
its
very
drinkable
and
all
but
just
lacks
on
the
taste
mostly
due
to
the
style
here
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
at
all
but
just
seems
a
bit
too
forgettable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
looselyformed
head
rises
quickly
and
fades
within
a
minute
a
few
spots
of
lacing
left
behind
slight
herbal
hop
aroma
grainybeery
smell
taste
is
decent
clean
malty
taste
slightly
grassytasting
hops
and
a
summerbeerlike
lemony
character
its
very
crisp
not
a
lot
of
lingering
bitterness
but
there
is
some
you
could
definitely
put
back
a
couple
of
these
in
the
summer
in
fact
right
or
wrong
i
think
id
buy
this
more
buy
d
notes
i
like
this
beer
very
sessionable
thought
it
is
kind
of
filling
quite
well
balanced
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
an
ale
has
a
clean
lager
character
d
good
beer
very
bright
and
refreshing
definitely
a
good
summer
pick
light
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
is
a
perfect
summertime
session
brew
d
probably
have
many
of
these
not
bad
in
and
of
itself
but
ide
prolly
go
for
soemthign
different
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
into
almost
nothingness
the
aroma
is
extraordinarily
faint
i
dont
really
pick
up
anything
at
least
i
dont
pick
up
any
negative
traits
the
taste
is
of
a
doughy
malt
and
some
grassy
hops
somewhat
similar
to
a
munich
lager
no
real
offputing
flavors
though
there
may
be
a
touch
of
cooked
veggie
flavor
but
it
is
very
light
th
feel
is
light
almost
moderate
with
nice
and
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
very
neutral
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
nevertheless
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
very
fresh
outdoorsy
aroma
floral
and
grain
it
tasted
sweet
a
little
bit
of
hops
influence
i
always
think
of
summer
beers
as
nice
session
beers
meant
to
be
enjoyed
on
hot
summer
days
and
this
one
fills
the
bill
d
this
beer
has
really
nice
fresh
flavors
and
a
good
balance
and
depth
to
them
it
went
down
really
smooth
and
fast
and
is
one
of
the
best
cream
ales
i
have
had
pours
a
very
clear
light
browndark
yellowgolden
color
with
little
head
aroma
matches
the
taste
nice
and
malty
with
good
hopping
good
sweetness
helps
make
this
beer
go
down
very
easily
i
only
had
one
but
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
on
a
warm
sunny
day
overall
this
was
not
bad
nothing
really
extraordinary
but
still
not
bad
at
all
i
would
take
one
in
a
pinch
but
would
not
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
still
a
solid
choice
and
one
that
you
really
cannot
go
wrong
with
overall
an
easy
drinking
blonde
ale
drinkability
is
good
a
good
match
for
the
delicious
pizza
as
a
lighter
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
to
start
off
the
night
with
and
then
work
your
way
towards
stronger
beers
later
in
the
evening
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
unless
there
werent
any
other
micro
taps
ive
had
a
couple
of
other
hooker
brews
but
i
think
this
the
red
and
pale
ales
are
ones
to
pass
up
pours
a
slightly
fogged
gold
nose
is
a
very
faint
fruit
tone
with
a
faint
odd
metallic
edge
flavor
is
kind
of
sweet
with
a
metallic
tone
that
hits
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
feels
good
on
the
mouth
and
its
a
nice
drinker
too
i
could
just
do
without
the
whole
metallic
side
of
it
very
easy
to
have
more
then
one
this
is
great
to
wash
down
picnic
fare
a
decent
offering
in
the
style
decent
as
a
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
in
the
summer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
like
a
hefeweizen
big
highly
carbonated
white
head
on
a
hard
pour
it
hangs
in
there
for
a
while
some
lacing
smell
not
much
tastes
like
a
slightly
more
crisp
and
hoppy
lager
not
a
bad
thirst
quencherlawnmower
beer
but
there
is
not
much
more
to
recommend
either
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
about
average
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
pleasant
tasting
enough
but
pretty
ordinary
i
do
not
generally
grab
a
blond
ale
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
it
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
bottle
courtesy
of
eclectic
thanks
again
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
while
at
poolside
last
evening
during
a
cookout
which
was
perfect
for
this
selection
not
one
of
my
first
choices
but
this
style
has
entices
me
every
so
often
color
was
cloudy
yellow
like
that
first
morning
piss
head
was
thin
and
broke
into
a
little
ring
that
maintained
throughout
spotty
lacing
not
coating
mouthfeel
was
not
what
i
imagined
for
this
style
alittle
more
carbonation
and
less
smooth
than
i
expected
taste
was
also
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
not
bad
but
was
expecting
more
this
to
me
is
like
the
good
looking
girl
with
the
soso
personality
would
pair
well
with
a
light
fair
not
bad
not
great
forgettable
but
not
regretable
not
bad
but
leaning
towards
lackluster
an
averageish
cream
ale
with
a
nice
touch
of
soft
citrus
not
bad
for
quenching
a
thirst
in
the
heat
of
summer
but
thats
about
it
i
have
had
this
and
the
ipa
from
hooker
and
living
in
ct
im
glad
to
have
found
something
local
that
i
can
really
get
behind
im
going
to
go
get
one
of
each
of
the
others
that
these
guys
make
because
i
expect
them
to
be
very
high
quality
reasonable
drinker
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
would
feel
comfortable
serving
it
to
those
who
have
a
preference
for
macros
but
want
to
let
their
hair
down
this
beer
poured
nicely
with
a
fair
head
and
little
carbonation
eventhough
there
was
a
fine
golden
color
the
body
was
bit
heavier
more
like
a
canadian
micro
cream
ale
the
taste
was
full
dry
with
just
a
bite
of
zest
although
some
get
an
aftertaste
i
did
not
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
is
suprising
in
the
taste
category
perfect
of
a
spring
day
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
12
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
semi
sweet
finish
its
dry
with
a
cream
ale
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
very
dry
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
this
is
a
very
dry
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
blonde
ale
it
has
little
character
and
is
very
much
middle
of
the
road
i
hope
the
other
hooker
brews
are
better
than
this
one
a
bit
cloudy
and
yellow
with
a
fair
white
head
you
can
smell
a
citrus
quality
pretty
quickly
a
slight
peppery
hint
too
that
seems
to
carry
over
into
the
first
mouthful
pretty
crisp
feel
with
a
doughyorange
taste
blondes
are
not
my
favorite
variety
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
this
one
had
that
tart
finish
that
seems
common
to
most
of
them
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
fairly
light
and
refreshing
while
maintaining
some
character
drinkability
could
definitely
quaff
a
few
of
these
while
sitting
on
the
beach
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
refreshing
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
this
is
a
perfect
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
it
definitely
fits
into
the
lawnmower
beer
category
this
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
think
this
would
make
an
excellent
summer
working
outside
beer
cold
crisp
clean
refreshing
but
wont
fry
your
tongue
or
have
you
laying
facefirst
in
the
kids
sandbox
could
also
pair
well
with
light
fare
such
as
salad
whitefish
chicken
etc
a
nice
find
and
a
beer
i
recommend
trying
and
enjoying
in
the
summer
heat
slightly
hazy
gold
in
the
pint
glass
with
consistent
fine
carbonation
smelled
metallic
which
was
a
real
turnoff
also
dough
honey
and
toast
i
couldnt
get
over
the
metal
which
was
also
present
in
the
taste
it
starts
sweet
gets
grainy
and
the
finish
is
metallic
and
dry
actually
the
dryness
of
the
finish
is
probably
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
this
beer
its
a
style
that
can
be
cloying
but
hookers
no
nonsense
where
that
goes
even
though
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
crap
for
either
a
blonde
or
a
cream
ale
i
could
certainly
put
a
couple
of
these
back
on
a
warm
day
due
to
the
light
body
and
the
dry
finish
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
white
fizzy
head
which
leaves
quickly
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
slight
hops
slight
grassy
wheat
some
grapefruit
and
slight
malts
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
slight
hoppymalty
nice
little
grapefruit
flavor
light
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
little
brew
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
to
straw
color
with
a
pure
white
head
which
laces
a
bit
the
smell
is
light
malts
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
light
floral
hoppiness
from
the
saaz
hops
the
taste
is
light
hops
with
a
touch
light
malty
base
the
beer
is
nearly
as
smooth
as
a
lager
but
retains
just
enough
malty
character
to
make
it
taste
like
a
true
ale
carbonation
is
high
but
right
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
provides
a
good
alternative
to
macro
lagers
good
beer
not
great
but
good
i
think
the
most
impressive
thing
about
the
thomas
hooker
blonde
is
its
cleanliness
you
know
that
its
an
ale
you
can
pick
that
up
in
the
nose
but
there
is
the
chance
that
it
could
be
a
lager
very
nice
and
its
balanced
so
often
blonde
ales
just
miss
the
mark
and
end
up
too
sweet
andor
malty
not
this
one
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
body
beneath
a
creamy
bright
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
better
than
average
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
displays
a
basic
grainy
and
strawlike
malt
with
some
grassy
and
lightly
floral
hops
in
the
back
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
crisp
the
flavor
offers
a
few
more
hops
still
grassy
and
floral
but
theyre
very
well
woven
into
the
overall
composition
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
and
the
maltiness
doesnt
stick
around
in
the
finish
its
very
firm
bitterness
balances
it
and
ushers
in
a
quick
dry
finish
with
just
a
swirl
of
shortlived
residual
floral
and
spicy
hops
cheers
clear
golden
corny
color
with
some
head
and
no
lacing
smells
malty
and
lightly
hoppy
nothing
deep
some
honey
in
there
too
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
more
of
a
hops
bite
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sudsy
verging
on
soapy
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
ice
cold
its
easy
to
down
a
few
of
them
however
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
macro
eww
not
much
to
chew
on
here
for
someone
looking
for
a
craft
brew
im
thinking
youre
better
off
saving
your
money
by
buying
some
molson
instead
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
with
minimal
head
smells
of
hops
with
mild
malt
some
creamy
notes
tastes
very
clean
after
taste
of
hops
with
a
spicey
character
odd
for
a
cream
ale
i
thought
but
tastey
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
beer
overall
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
d
easy
drinking
and
a
good
example
of
cream
ale
worth
a
try
from
thomas
hooker
i
cant
really
nail
this
one
down
dont
know
why
i
do
know
it
is
enjoyable
and
is
a
smooth
brew
on
a
hot
muggy
day
cheers
thomas
hooker
cream
ale
is
a
pleasant
brew
it
pours
from
the
bottle
an
ever
so
slightly
hazy
golden
color
the
head
does
not
last
long
but
this
is
no
major
loss
the
smell
is
malty
and
perhaps
also
a
bit
yeasty
the
taste
is
malty
sweetness
while
there
are
images
of
hops
on
the
bottle
lable
noticable
hops
bittering
is
absent
and
thankfully
so
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
pleasant
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
very
high
drinkability
goes
very
well
with
a
spicy
pepperoni
pizza
taste
is
a
light
toasty
malt
very
lightly
hopped
nutty
sweet
some
light
fruit
mouthfeel
is
medium
lighter
than
other
ale
styles
but
heavier
than
a
lager
drinkability
is
very
high
very
sessionable
somewhat
hoppy
but
not
too
much
it
went
down
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
overly
unique
but
tasty
and
pleasant
all
in
all
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
inoffensive
cream
ale
thats
a
pretty
good
fit
for
a
warm
day
and
a
group
of
beer
lovers
who
might
be
new
to
craft
beer
nothing
remarkable
here
just
a
solid
example
of
the
style
pours
a
pale
amber
with
minimal
head
the
nose
is
fresh
malts
and
a
slightly
burnt
sugar
smell
the
beer
tastes
very
smooth
with
a
creamy
nutty
sweetness
thats
really
the
only
taste
going
on
here
aside
from
a
brief
wash
of
hops
at
the
end
of
the
mouthful
theres
not
much
going
on
here
kind
of
boring
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
round
this
beer
would
be
drinkable
if
it
were
more
interesting
but
without
a
hook
whats
the
point
meh
d
smoothly
drinkable
a
good
party
beer

topped
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
of
small
bubbles
settles
fairly
quickly
to
smattering
of
dust
no
lacing
but
plenty
of
carbonation
streams
the
smell
is
fairly
clean
with
some
grassy
hops
relatively
light
little
in
the
way
of
malt
the
taste
is
a
touch
grainy
and
sweet
with
some
spicy
hops
interspersed
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
and
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
solidly
drinkable
beer
that
works
nothing
spectacular
but
a
great
beer
for
the
crossover
crowd

a
light

aroma
with
hints
of

coming
through
at
the
end
a
nice
creamy
taste
very
mellow
flavor
folowed
by
nice
clean
dry
hoppy
finish
light
in
the
mouth
maybe
a
little
watery
but
not
to
thin
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
the
light
creamy
taste
helps
one
mellow
out
quickly
you
can
sit
back
and
drink
several
in
one
sitting

a
decent
example
of
a
lighter
style
of
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
small
head
the
smell
is
a
very
strong
biscuit
scent
this
is
like
walking
into
a
bakery
the
taste
is
a
creamy
crisp
hoppy
beer
there
are
some
floral
and
malt
flavors
that
make
a
light
and
very
well
balanced
mf
this
is
a
good
summer
brew
i
could
go
for
another

a
good
intro
beer
to
an
impressive
brewery
hey
its
not
all
about
liberator
or
old
marley
its
ok
to
like
the
little
beers
had
this
one
after
i
tried
the
pale
ale
and
wish
i
had
reversed
my
sampling
order
this
awesome
brew
has
a
beautiful
color
and
appearance
with
a
classic
mediumtofull
body
and
great
driedfruit
flavors
throughout
fresh
buds
on
the
nose
round
out
all
of
the
excellent
characteristics
of
this
great
local
brew
the
flavor
is
the
standout
of
this
beer
sweet
good
carbonation
smooth
and
light
to
medium
bodied
i
could
drink
a
six
of
this
and
not
think
twice
it
would
make
a
great
summertime
beer
this
is
the
second
hooker
that
ive
had
ive
also
had
their
apa
and
its
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
first
its
still
good
though
dont
get
me
wrong
not
100
sure
if
id
want
to
get
this
again
though
if
you
havent
had
it
its
really
worth
a
try
its
interesting
overall
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
a
good
session
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
too
bad
its
starting
to
get
cold
here
in
ma
i
could
have
used
this
one
in
august
an
interestingly
simple
beer
that
i
surprisingly
like
a
lot
its
a
quality
summer
brew
and
ultra
drinkable
okay
but
i
cant
get
past
the
veggie
notes
and
blanket
of
blandness
that
seems
to
coat
my
palate
perhaps
this
bottle
is
not
as
fresh
as
i
thought
tough
to
tell
with
no
freshness

almost
bready
with
a
light

finish
crisp
and
smooth
with

goes
well
with
the
warm
weather
although
its
probably
a
decent
choice
any
time
of
year
a
good
little
hooker
this
blonde
and
a
good
trade
was
had
to
get
one
another
hoppy
cream
ale
not
sure
how
close
to
style
lines
this
one
might
be
but
not
bad
pours
a
notquiteclear
gold
with
a
slight
head
flavor
is
sweet
from
malts
but
has
a
nice
hop
kick
to
it
as
well
also
picking
up
tones
of
honey
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
not
as
heavy
and
creamy
as
the
few
other
cream
ales
i
have
tried
but
comes
across
as
moreorless
crisp
thanks
to
muddyfeet
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
excells
in
the
mouthfeel
silky

makes
it
very
drinkable
ontap
at
grants
in
west
hartford
ct
it
had
evaded
me
ontap
for
quite
some
time
so
i
was
happy
to
find
it
i
felt
it
might
has
been
served
a
bit
too
cold
though
yellowgolden
crystalline
body
with
a
thick
dense
bleached
white
head
that
laced
well
a
bit
of
sourdough
bread
on
the
nose
but
not
much
pleasant
but
not
impressive
the
taste
was
a
bit
weak
and
bland
for
my
liking
with
very
light
malting
and
a
bit
of
sharp
tang
however
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
and
creamy
crisp
and
acid
enough
too
very
drinkable
on
the
warm
summer
eve
too

almost
doughy
with

the
is
a
light
sweet
grassy
aroma
with
a
nice
hint
of
lemon
there
is
a
light
sting
of
bitterness
and
some
citrus
at
the
start
of
the
flavor
that
moves
to
a
smooth
malty
character
then
to
a
gentle
hop
on
the
finish
a
hint
of
pears
and
some
limelike
citrusy
tastes
adds
a
bit
of
balance
to
this
maltleaning
brew
smooth
and
freshing
the
mouthfeel
has
a
good
creamy
medium
body
that
flows
over
the
palate
ohso
smoothly
an
easily
drinkable
brew
that
would
be
great
in
the
summer
months
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
definetly
worth
your
time
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
bestowing
this
one
upon
me
thanks
to
pete
for
this
beer
it
pours
a
slightly
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
top
the
nose
is
slightly
grasseygrainey
witha
honey
sweetness
very
mellow
no
harshness
as
in
other
grainey
aromas
i
have
experienced
the
flavor
is
spot
on
to
the
nose
the
grainey
hits
first
followed
by
the
sweetness
that
moves
back
to
a
slgiht
grainey
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
overall
this
is
a
solid
blonde
refreshing
and
enjoyable
all
around
hooker
blonde
ale
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
that
doesnt
impress
with
bells
and
whistles
but
with
sheer
quality
cream
ales
will
never
be
among
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
along
with
rogue
honey
cream
ale
that
ive
had
and
just
might
be
in
my
regular
rotation
if
i
lived
in
the
constitution
state
thanks
to
far333
for
the
bottle
i
was
surpised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
cream
ale
but
i
checked
the
company
website
and
sure
enough
thats
what
it
is
a
wellcrafted
ale
so
often
it
seems
that
blonde
or
golden
ales
are
just
pale
ale
wannabes
aroma
was
very
fresh
and
a
little
grassy
poured
a
bright
gold
flavor
profile
was
nice
and
lively
bigger
malt
than
i
expected
with
a
full
but
not
heavy
mouthfeel
hops
were
well
balanced
a
little
sharp
and
lemony
would
be
a
great
session
ale
thanks
to
far333
for
the
sample
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
light
white
head
leaving
no
lace
aromas
are
a
mix
of
corn
and
toasted
malts
which
follows
with
light
hops
flavors
are
sweet
and
creamy
with
a
decent
dosage
of
sweet
corn
with
a
super
light
body
the
finish
is
crisp
and
somewhat
bitter
with
a
clean
hop
bite
though
this
brew
is
fairly
light
it
keeps
a
decent
body
with
its
creamy
flavors
overall
a
great
session
beer
that
to
me
would
make
a
great
opener
to
introducing
people
to
better
beer
a
nice
offering
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
white
head
above
the
polished
gold
brew
head
is
gone
in
a
flash
with
lacing
minimal
to
average
aroma
is
lightly
of
pale
malts
with
a
dash
of
hops
taste
is
follows
along
with
sweet
pale
malt
character
coupled
with
a
crisp
hops
bite
have
to
appreciate
lack
of
off
flavors
in
such
a
clean
brew
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
great
a
good
introduction
for
people
to
better
local
brews
a
flavorful
version
of
the
style
and
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
nothing
flashy
the
style
itself
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
but
this
version
is
actually
pleasant
and
a
bit
tasty
clear
light
gold
creamy
white
head
stays
for
a
bit
and
then
settles
leaving
a
tight
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
makes
me
think
of
a
vienna
lager
because
of
the
strong
honeygrain
combo
with
some
mustiness
i
get
from
some
lagers
flavor
starts
sweet
with
the
honey
accompanied
by
citrus
and
vanilla
in
just
the
right
balance
floral
and
spicy
hops
make
a
beautiful
show
bitterness
appears
and
creeps
in
but
still
leaves
it
on
the
sweet
side
medium
body
and
creamy
mouthfeel
very
pleasant
drinking
this
beer
is
damn
good
and
will
be
a
regular
of
mine
once
they
get
into
massachusetts
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
rises
to
a
half
inch
and
slooowly
settles
down
aroma
is
biscuity
malt
some
pear
and
butterscotch
and
a
faint
grassy
hop
line
flavor
is
chewy
with
light
sweet
malts
some
buttery
corn
and
a
light
cinammon
backbone
a
light
hoppy
tingle
finishes
it
off
and
a
roasted
corn
thing
lingers
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
and
thin
legs
of
lace
run
down
the
lenght
of
the
glass
i
could
drink
this
all
night
to
be
honest
a
perfect
example
of
a
session
brew
but
cream
ale
more
like
a
golden
ale
to
me
seek
and
drink
pours
a
gold
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
aromas
were
slight
but
well
balanced
malthops
tangy
crisp
refreshing
taste
well
balanced
decent
body
and
mouthfeel
mild
hop
finish
this
is
an
unnasuming
beer
that
was
intended
for
the
nonba
thanksgiving
guests
all
enjoyed
it
and
i
agree
this
would
make
a
good
session
or
quenching
beer
id
probably
get
this
again
the
next
time
i
go
to
the
restaurant
unless
they
have
a
new
beer
on
tap
the
beer
is
a
pale
golden
color
it
has
a
bit
of
a
head
to
it
not
too
much
in
the
aroma
department
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
whill
of
some
hops
body
is
about
medium
taste
is
a
bit
malty
but
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
no
real
bitterness
to
it
but
maybe
im
getting
numb
from
drinking
too
many
hop
devils
a
really
good
session
beer
overall
just
an
average
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
free
one
golden
light
light
yellow
sheet
of
white
atop
and
brillantly
clarified
smells
like
skunk
corn
grain
and
some
bits
of
soil
tastes
like
cheap
beer
stronger
than
a
coors
light
but
less
than
say
a
rolling
rock
simple
and
grainy
with
little
satisfying
merits
thin
and
moderately
carbed
with
a
wet
finish
that
lingers
longer
than
id
prefer
seems
like
a
decent
pairing
with
the
shitty
jack
in
the
box
i
have
beside
me
this
was
a
fine
refreshing
beer
never
great
but
usually
great
for
the
price
miller
finally
took
over
completely
it
seems
and
killed
it
it
doesnt
even
taste
similar
looks
like
its
brewed
in
milwaukee
nowhence
the
standard
brown
longnecks
and
even
the
cardboard
on
the
12
pack
is
now
that
really
thin
stuff
clearly
a
different
plant
they
also
added
milwaukee
wi
on
the
bottle
this
stuff
was
really
nasty
even
the
smell
immediately
it
just
smelled
like
cheap
beer
sad
what
the
heck
have
you
done
to
your
blue
boar
beer
i
have
never
been
much
of
a
beer
drinker
but
2
years
ago
my
daughter
introduced
me
to
your
green
bottle
blue
boar
i
loved
it
right
off
the
bat
and
have
been
buying
it
ever
since
i
tried
2
half
cases
of
the
brown
bottle
blue
boar
and
will
never
drink
it
again
and
neither
will
my
daughter
i
dont
like
the
heavy
taste
and
i
get
extremely
bloated
off
the
first
bottle
or
two
have
you
changed
the
recipe
to
try
a
new
and
improved
version
of
this
yuk
the
green
bottle
blue
boar
had
such
a
light
crisp
sparkling
taste
to
it
my
daughter
even
tried
a
switch
and
bait
taste
test
and
picked
out
the
brown
bottle
after
sipping
them
both
we
dont
like
it
sad
to
say
ill
be
trying
others
beers
till
i
come
across
something
similar
to
the
original
blue
boar
im
really
going
to
miss
you
sincerely
carla
dont
like
the
new
bottle
the
green
bottle
was
classic
blue
boar
and
they
switched
to
a
brown
longnecki
am
going
to
have
to
switch
o
sessionable
not
that
great
but
not
bad
update
with
about
two
inches
left
in
the
glass
lacing
starts
to
stick
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
love
blue
boar
but
lately
the
company
is
putting
private
reserve
bottles
with
the
blue
boar
label
not
right
herny
what
is
wrong
with
you
guys
i
have
bought
5
12
packs
recently
with
the
brown
bottles
with
the
blue
boar
label
its
not
blue
boar
its
private
reserve
come
on
you
guys
overall
hmm
i
enjoyed
this
more
on
a
hot
day
in
july
than
i
am
tonight
not
a
whole
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
with
this
beer
the
appearance
actually
turned
out
to
be
kinda
nice
the
lacing
was
slightly
patchy
in
some
areas
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
very
thick
on
top
of
that
it
followed
me
all
the
way
down
the
glass
which
is
very
nice
this
is
a
tough
one
because
the
body
wasnt
very
nice
at
all
but
the
head
wasnt
bad
at
all
and
the
lacing
was
very
nice
i
mean
its
riiight
in
between
a
3
5
and
4
damn
this
is
hard
ill
give
it
a
4
just
because
i
have
no
idea
what
type
of
beer
it
is
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hop
flavor
from
a
pale
ale
and
the
skunky
smell
was
a
definite
turn
off
but
i
didnt
dislike
the
beer
reminded
me
more
of
a
dutch
style
lager
called
heineken
than
an
irish
style
pale
ale
however
a
friend
of
mine
loves
this
stuff
so
to
each
their
own
this
is
an
ok
brew
the
main
thing
that
stands
out
the
most
is
the
biscuity
malt
flavor
it
is
fairly
nice
but
the
rest
of
the
brew
is
slightly
lacking
and
not
very
flavorful
the
body
was
light
and
crisp
drinkability
was
very
good
the
bottle
i
used
to
do
this
review
disappeared
very
quickly
good
thing
they
sell
these
in
sixers
i
was
able
to
crack
another
overall
not
a
special
beer
but
at
6
a
sixer
its
certainly
a
good
budget
choice
im
not
sure
why
this
is
listed
as
a
cream
ale
here
on
ba
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
straightup
pale
ale
to
me
not
worth
seeking
out
but
worth
trying
next
time
your
heading
over
to
your
macro
friends
place
maybe
you
can
make
a
new
craft
beer
lover
o
had
someone
handed
me
a
glass
of
this
and
asked
me
to
name
the
style
i
would
have
sworn
that
it
was
an
adjunct
lager
it
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
exactly
like
an
adjunct
as
an
adjunct
its
ok
as
an
irish
pale
ale
its
not
very
good
i
would
rename
this
brew
blue
bore
i
wont
be
buying
this
again

finish
little

then
boom
more

overall
decent
for
the

but
not
my
cup
of

drinkability
is
decent
if
this
wasnt
skunked
it
would
rank
higherbut
not
much
higher
ugh
for
nostalgia
purposes
only
for
me
its
not
blue
at
all
it
is
kind
of
a
boar
though
if
it
was
blue
then
its
appearance
would
be
much
more
appealing
but
this
is
a
nice
somewhat
citrustinged
beer
i
found
that
it
goes
great
with
a
meal
bison
burger
fries
and
just
has
a
pleasant
taste
overall
the
downside
here
is
that
it
has
a
low
alcohol
yet
it
is
a
little
filling
taste
i
dunno
its
probably
sympathy
or
something
but
this
stuff
just
became
an
acquired
taste
during
the
adolescent
years
had
it
again
recently
just
have
to
admit
its
not
that
good
but
you
know
thanks
for
the
memories
no
hops
or
malt
just
cheap
beer
wo
a
slick
ad
campaign
a
desireable
alternative
to
bmc
this
does
have
its
own
unique
taste
going
for
it
and
yes
there
is
taste
something
a
little
fruity
never
would
i
describe
this
as
a
cream
ale
pale
ale
cream
ale
adjunct
lager
too
much
nomenclature
confusion
over
essentially
a
thinly
disguised
macro
surprisingly
good
beer
although
its
bit
harder
to
find
these
days
it
has
a
distinct
aroma
almost
skunky
so
if
thats
your
thing
this
is
a
great
beer
for
you
not
much
head
and
rich
color
go
along
with
this
beer
a
good
beer
for
the
buck
but
if
you
can
i
recommend
weinhards
hefeweizen
over
this
dno
thank
you
this
is
easily
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
in
years
the
rest
is
going
down
the
drain
d
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
micromacro
beers
to
drink
it
is
a
nice
light
lager
that
has
had
slightly
more
effort
put
into
it
than
99
of
the
macros
out
there
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
great
for
parties
grills
anything
really
cheap
to
considering
the
taste
it
provides
drinkability
despite
its
relative
blandness
in
flavor
it
is
pretty
refreshing
the
taste
is
similar
being
mostly
light
slightly
toasty
grain
faint
hint
of
caramel
hint
of
mineral
lightly
spicey
leafygrassycitrusy
bitterness
that
just
dominates
the
finish
and
aftertaste
a
light
but
clear
citrusy
quality
almost
a
hint
of
grapefruit
is
present
by
the
finish
cant
write
any
more
right
now
cause
i
have
to
enjoy
this
with
a
cigar
overall
not
the
worst
pale
ale
sure
its
not
complicated
but
the
price
is
fairly
low
and
its
easy
to
drink
it
seems
like
it
would
make
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
i
can
certainly
imagine
picking
some
up
for
a
picnic
or
cookout
it
resulted
in
a
very
average
beer
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
to
classify
this
as
a
unique
experience
lest
that
be
construed
as
criticism
let
me
add
this
it
was
worth
the
buck
i
paid
for
it
pours
a
golden
body
with
small
white
head
with
okay
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
like
lemons
and
weak
hops
and
malts
tastes
about
the
same
fairly
tolerable
though
mouthfeel
is
about
standard
not
as
carbonated
as
i
would
like
overall
its
an
alright
cream
d
this
would
be
a
great
hot
day
beer
not
a
lot
of
anything
going
on
and
really
not
that
unpleasant
once
you
get
past
the
nose
id
really
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
or
from
a
brown
bottle
a
good
session
beer
taste
is
about
like
the
nose
with
a
decently
balanced
ale
comprised
of
mild
malts
tempered
sweetness
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
is
slightly
astringent
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
soft
overall
this
is
any
easy
drinking
well
balanced
ale
that
i
found
enjoyable
overall
there
is
a
powdery
mouth
feel
with
an
astringent
finish
there
is
also
carbonation
on
the
tongue
a
poorly
made
pale
ale
there
is
no
malt
character
or
a
lack
thereof
hops
appearance
is
a
light
golden
with
a
thin
quickly
disapating
head
smell
and
taste
has
a
slightly
sweet
honey
breadiness
and
lightly
hopped
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
carbonation
making
it
go
down
crisp
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
the
money
of
all
the
weingards
this
is
probably
my
favorite
in
my
opinion
henry
weinhards
blue
boar
lager
sorry
ale
is
a
slightly
higher
quality
alternative
to
bmc
the
suits
at
blitzweinhard
should
change
the
bottles
to
brown
glass
and
should
make
sure
the
price
stays
low

would

also
the

sez
pale

but
it
is
more
of
a
cream
ale
if
thats
what
you
want
to
call
it
palatable
but
not
my
favorite
of
their
brews
still
at
5
99
a
sixer
pretty
good
d
i
missed
the
cream
but
did
not
find
this
terrible
just
bland
it
didnt
have
enough
flavor
or
character
to
entice
me
to
try
it
again
drinkability
tasty
lighter
brew
good
session
choice
i
like
the
caramel
malt
coming
through
in
the
middle
but
the
hop
finish
could
be
better
the
yeast
produces
very
little
ale
fruitiness
and
i
think
this
gives
the
euro
lager
impression
i
think
this
still
has
enough
ale
identity
though
and
for
me
this
is
a
goodvery
drinkable
straight
from
the
bottle
after
workbarbeque
ale
doesnt
even
pass
as
mediocre
water
is
a
better
and
healthier
option
i
used
to
drink
beers
like
this
all
the
time
last
night
i
bought
a
six
pack
on
a
whim
and
had
a
few
was
it
always
this
bad
i
couldnt
believe
what
a
lack
of
flavor
this
beer
had
surely
its
not
a
pale
ale
like
the
label
says
it
tastes
more
like
a
cheap
lager
than
anything
there
was
no
real
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
just
a
drab
bitterness
like
chewing
on
a
clot
of
wool
years
ago
this
was
my
favorite
henrys
beer
as
i
recall
now
i
cant
even
remember
a
time
when
i
actually
wanted
to
drink
a
beer
like
this
not
much
going
on
here
fairly
basic
but
decent
for
the
price
of
10
for
a
12
pack
a
good
option
if
im
tight
on
cash
or
just
want
to
throw
back
a
few
easy
ones
well
this
is
an
ale
the
look
smell
and
taste
all
point
to
a
eurostyle
lager
but
who
knows
a
faintly
orange
body
with
a
very
short
lived
head
sit
rather
lacklusterly
in
my
glass
it
almost
reminds
me
of
sparkling
apple
cider
not
hard
in
that
way
but
with
less
visible
carbonation
the
taste
too
is
ciderlike
that
is
to
say
sweet
and
plainly
malty
with
hardly
any
hop
flavor
albeit
a
bit
a
spice
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
a
bit
too
crisp
at
first
but
quite
refreshing
with
a
long
wet
afterfeel
decent
drinkability
as
well
just
because
of
its
plainness
and
lack
of
offense
d
after
finding
out
that
this
was
a
cream
ale
and
not
a
pa
it
gave
it
a
better
ranking
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pas
not
to
bad
way
better
than
private
reserve
pours
a
five
finger
frothy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
pale
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
starts
boring
only
hints
of
malt
and
hops
doesnt
taste
like
any
of
the
irish
ales
ive
had
finish
is
clean
due
to
lack

yeilds
a

head
of

aromas
of

similar
taste
with
hints
of
grain
and
sweet
corn
not
sure
what
the
brewer
had
in
mind
with
this
one
mouthfeel
was
unexceptional
drinkability
is
average
at
best
thanks
to
dubbercody
for
providing
the
sample
this
was
one
of
my
staple
beers
before
the
great
micro
movement
and
i
still
like
it
a
good
summer
beer
and
quite
quaffable
this
is
a
very
difficult
beer
to
describe
its
drinkable
but
has
an
odd
taste
id
say
its
worth
a
try
just
to
experience
the
smell
and
taste
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
much
of
this
nor
have
it
very
often
but
it
is
a
definite
change
of
pace
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
when
im
out
of
money
by
far
the
cheapest
thing
i
drink
not
the
best
but
one
of
my
favorites
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
body
and
a
strong
skunk
like
dryness
to
it
the
pale
factor
is
about
the
best
part
its
very
light
so
it
makes
this
ok
beer
easy
to
choke
down
even
if
you
dont
like
it
the
best
thing
about
this
stuff
is
its
cheap
precisely
the
reason
i
bought
it
it
also
compares
favorably
to
most
other
options
i
saw
when
looking
for
crap
beer
at
the
store
today
still
this
is
for
nothing
more
than
dispassionate
consumption
while
staring
at
the
computer
or
the
tv
the
8
for
12
bottle
price
tag
of
this
brew
couldnt
be
beaten
at
the
critical
moment
at
the
supermarket
and
i
have
to
agree
w
the
previous
review
that
this
one
just
might
not
be
a
cream
ale
this
drinks
down
okay
but
only
if
your
standards
are
low
if
you
really
want
taste
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
as
i
said
not
even
near
a
decent
ale
steer
clear
unless
you
havent
got
the
dough
for
better
beer
or
just
dont
give
a
darn
this
beer
poured
a
yellow
color
with
little
head
that
falls
to
nothing
after
pouring
it
the
nose
was
skunked
awful
nasty
ass
skunked
beer
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
as
well
and
it
still
was
not
good
the
taste
was
pretty
much
not
there
it
was
kind
of
like
white
noise
for
my
tongue
the
beer
was
moderate
to
thin
eh
another
dumber
from
good
old
henry
i
dont
know
what
this
brewery
is
doing
but
its
not
good
i
have
one
more
to
try
from
there
and
im
scared
this
stuff
would
be
really
easy
to
drink
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
better
blue
boar
poured
a
very
medium
gold
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of

remains
slightly
on
the
glass
througout
the
beer
the
smell
is
very
funky
at
first
when
first
opening
bottle
you
will
get
the
wiff
when
poured
traces
remain
earth
tones
linger
with
traces
of
floral
notes
while
the
smell
and
appearance
are
less
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
slightly
better
a
perfect
blen
of
bitter
and
sweet
and
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
light
bodied
but
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
the
malt
beginning
is
sandwiched
by
hops
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
really
a
true
pale
ale
per
say
but
this
went
down
very
smooth
blue
boar
was
served
from
a
12
oz
green
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
pale
clear
golden
color
and
was
topped
by
a
thin
whitish
head
the
nose
was
strange
but
not
so
bad
a
combination
of
tortilla
chip
maltiness
and
a
slightly
skunky
and
spritzy
citric
hoppiness
the
taste
was
better
than
i
expected
it
would
be
citrictinged
cream
malts
a
following
zippy
lightly
acidic
citric
transistion
and
a
satisfying
mildly
bittered
citriccream
finish
the
body
was
adequately
full
and
the
carbonation
was
just
right
overall
a
pretty
tasty
and
well
done
beer

the

i
will
be

again
though
this

poured
with

evaporated
within
moments
of
landing
in
my

a

it

enjoy
more

i
never

now
i
know

weissbier
it
also
reminds
me
slightly
of
boulevards
hibiscus
gose
though
not
of
that
quality
is
this
brewed
with
lactobacillus
aroma
is
very
thin
weak
biscuit
malt
with
a
sour
note
that
suggests
lemon
vinegar
but
nothing
i
would
call
cherry
some
weak
fruity
hint
is
there
but
my
nose
does
not
recognize
it
as
cherry
black
or
otherwise
taste
is
tart
sweet
tarts
married
to
mineral
water
smothering
hints
of
biscuit
malt
honey
fruit
that
show
up
primarily
in
the
finish
i
can
imagine
a
little
cherry
here
afrertaste
is
rapidly
fading
mostly
fruity
tart
then
nothing
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
producing
a
prickly
bite
a
little
slick
dry
crisp
did
not
enjoy
very
sour
i
rate
this
beer
a
2
5
out
of
5
a
nice
surprising
tartness
and
a
great
mouth
feel
not
near
as
fruity
as
it
sounds
drinks
like
a
lager
the
black
cherry
is
not
overpowering
but
it
is
pronounced
good
beer
i
would
like
higher
abv
though
a
pretty
bland
beer
not
much
body
and
the
finish
is
lackluster
has
more
of
a
wheat
beer
character
than
a
cream
ale
and
the
tartness
from
the
cherries
weird
fermentation
is
pretty
kickin
kind
of
dry
and
very
tart
not
really
much
else
though
it
is
refreshing
though
ill
give
it
that
o
not
at
all
what
i
expected
when
i
opened
the
bottle
from
the
appearance
through
to
the
flavor
it
definitely
has
cherry
but
much
more
of
a
tart
sour
version
than
the
sweetness
i
thought
would
be
there
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
these
all
day
but
as
a
oneoff
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
another
weak
offering
from
erie
brewing
the
initial
rotting
cherry
odor
assaulted
my
nose
and
nearly
made
me
drop
the
bottle
fortunately
it
quickly
dispersed
leaving
behind
only
a
weak
cherry
odor
after
that
i
was
surprised
that
the
beer
actually
didnt
taste
completely
horrible
what
little
cherry
flavor
was
present
rapidly
gave
way
to
a
moderate
maltiness
the
lack
of
lacing
and
the
shortlived
fizzy
head
were
somewhat
disappointing
it
seems
a
shame
that
considering
the
proximity
of
erie
to
the
cherry
and
grape
growing
region
of
pa
no
cherries
were
harmed
making
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
has
been
revised
people
have
had
bad
bottles
or
ive
somehow
gotten
an
exceptionally
good
one
but
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
its
softly
fluffy
creamy
smooth
with
an
excellent
crispness
flowing
with
the
rolling
smoothness
just
the
right
note
of
dryness
cuts
through
the
sweet
preventing
any
cloying
feel
or
stickiness
the
flavor
is
as
expected
pretty
safe
with
slight
cherry
taste
that
adds
a
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
with
a
light
yeast
tanginess
and
mild
creamy
texture
of
malt
in
the
back
with
a
subtle
semi
dry
mild
finish
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
not
exceptional
but
it
did
exceed
my
expectations
worth
a
try
however
i
probably
will
not
purchase
it
again
i
poured
this
beer
and
it
has
a
light
rose
color
body
with
a
very
small
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
with
a
cherry
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overpouring
of
cherry
imo
it
coild
be
a
little
more
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
goes
down
easy
and
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
this
in
the
summer
overall
they
really
made
quite
a
good
fruit
beer
maybe
too
fruity
but
its
far
from
watery
and
has
enough
hop
balance
for
it
to
be
a
beer
i
would
get
it
again
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
black
cherries
and
breadygrainy
malt
i
think
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
full
of
breadygrainy
malt
and
sweet
cherries
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
surprisingly
creamy
it
has
good
soft
carbonation
which
helps
make
this
brew
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
solid
beer
overall
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down

a
single
well
im
surprised
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
cream
ale
what
its
the
very
definition
of
a
fruit
beer
the
black
cherry
is
on
the
front
and
back
and
everywhere
in
between
its
in
the
smell
and
its
all
around
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
tart
and
pretty
sweet
with
a
malt
body
that
reminds
you
that
this
is
a
beer
and
not
some
sort
of
a
wine
cooler
make
no
qualms
about
it
this
is
a
fruit
beer
its
not
a
beer
with
fruit
juice
added
it
tastes
like
fruit
juice
with
beer
added
take
that
as
you
will
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
one
was
enough
for
me
and
i
doubt
i
could
ever
have
more
than
two
in
a
session
the
dominance
of
the
cherry
makes
this
a
super
girly
beer
some
malt
lots
of
tart
and
sweet
cherries
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
its
far
from
great
fruit
beers
are
sometimes
difficult
to
get
right
with
this
beer
the
flavors
seem
a
tad
off
its
an
acceptable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
especially
on
a
steamy
hot
early
summer
afternoon
overall
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
light
enough
and
blend
well
in
the
cream
ale
style
refreshing
o
this
beer
definitely
feels
like
a
cream
ale
but
the
cherry
flavors
seem
artificial
and
not
strong
enough
this
concept
has
potential
i
like
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
and
the
cereal
grains
seem
spot
on
had
real
black
cherries
been
used
this
would
probably
be
a
hit
as
it
is
the
artificiality
of
the
cherry
flavoring
is
off
putting
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
overall
a
decent
and
refreshing
cherry
ale
just
dont
expect
a
lambic
or
kriek
not
really
a
cream
ale
either
o
overall
an
all
around
decent
beer
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
really
hoped
it
would
not
taste
like
a
cooler
which
it
does
not
to
me
has
a
beer
taste
and
feel
would
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
im
not
getting
any
cherry
from
it
finished
two
bottles
served
in
a
pint
glass
overall
pretty
disappointing
you
wont
be
dissipointed
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
there
isnt
as
much
cherry
flavour
but
maybe
thats
a
good
thing
its
got
shades
of
a
sour
beer
so
fans
of
that
style
might
enjoy
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
off
but
other
than
that
its
a
beer
worth
trying
once
overall
while
on
the
sweeter
side
this
was
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
one
that
is
good
on
a
summer
day
and
one
well
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
had
it
creamy
mouthfeel
sweet
biscuit
graininess
up
front
followed
by
a
subtle
floral
and
earthy
hop
presence
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
cherry
tartness
lingering
black
cherries
in
the
mouth
but
nothing
too
overbearing
nice
feeling
in
the
mouth
but
a
little
too
much
lingering
sweetness
also
its
a
little
boring
even
for
a
fruit
beer
which
usually
have
some
interesting
qualities
be
it
good
or
bad
overall
this
beer
isnt
perfect
but
im
partial
to
cherries
so
i
can
overlook
some
of
its
flaws
i
think
it
would
be
better
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
than
a
cream
ale
though
as
the
cream
ale
character
is
absolutely
buried
here
nicely
light
but
flavorful
fruited
beer
thats
neither
hitting
you
over
the
head
nor
taste
weak
artificial
a
quarter
inch
of
bright
white
fizz
settles
onto
a
bright
tangerine
colored
body
other
than
sweet
cherry
medicine
aromas
there
isnt
much
going
on
in
the
nose
once
more
the
sweet
cherry
overpowers
the
tastebuds
but
there
is
a
hint
of
some
citrus
from
hops
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
lacking
a
touch
overall
this
is
drinkable
if
you
like
a
dominate
cherry
flavor
if
not
grab
one
anyway
its
not
that
bad
overall
interesting
but
not
great
glad
i
tried
it
probably
wont
try
it
again
i
was
expecting
the
sweetness
to
come
through
more
in
the
taste
that
it
didnt
might
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
i
feared
this
beer
would
veer
into
cough
syrup
territory
but
its
quite
restrained
not
much
to
it
no
obvious
flaws
certainly
decent
enough
o
overall
this
beer
was
not
horrible
but
the
sweetness
was
just
too
much
for
me
derailed
black
cherry

a

amber
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
perhaps
a
bit
metallic
at
first
this
is
a
light
bodied
mildly
cherry
flavored
beer
not
particularly
good
and
doesnt
compare
particularly
well
to
other
fruit
flavored
beers
not
bad
for
what
it
is
they
threw
some
artificial
cherry
flavoring
into
a
cream
ale
a
popular
style
up
north
in
these
parts
with
gennys
cream
ale
and
other
canadian
versions
making
some
sales
this
is
a
niche
beer
for
those
that
like
this
style
and
it
actually
works
its
drinkable

a
nice
light
cream

base
mouthfeel
a
bit
strong
with
carbonation
a
bit
sweet
but
drinks
smooth
will
be
popular
with
the
ladies
in
closing
its
not
my
style
but
i
always
try
to
give
a
fair
shake
to
local
pa
beers
especially
one
like
erie
that
ive
been
drinking
since
ive
found
good
beer
o
easy
to
drink
but
also
not
exciting
to
drink
at
least
it
doesnt
suck
o
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
im
not
a
huge
sweet
beer
fan
so
its
just
a
bit
overboard
for
me
but
even
so
its
quite
good
i
think
they
balanced
it
pretty
well
with
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
this
is
the
second
chance
ive
tried
this
beer
first
time
the
bottle
was
obviously
old
it
gushed
out
the
bottle
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
and
did
not
smell
good
at
all
this
time
it
was
in
as
new
stock
so
i
jumped
on
the
chance
to
try
it
given
my
obscene
love
for
black
cherry
soda
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
mild
grainy
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
cherry
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
of
the
cherry
in
it
along
with
the
aformentioned
sweet
grainy
malts
theres
not
too
many
other
dimensions
in
here
its
a
pretty
simple
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
more
cherry
flavor
its
present
on
the
beginning
and
leaves
a
slight
lingering
flavor
but
for
a
black
cherry
ale

i
dont
really
know
what
to
say
aside
from
that
its
a
nice
rather
plain
beer
various
flavors
that
individually
arent
special
but
as
a
group
make
it
interesting
over
more
standardplain
beers
no
noticeable
maple
taste
to
me
aside
from
a
general
wood
taste
i
was
expecting
something
bolder
and
better
i
am
done
with
gib
beer
and
how
they
play
it
safe
however
i
do
enjoy
the
lions
gate
winter
ale
and
the
odd
brew
master
in
house
craft
beer
specials
hey
gib
time
to
step
it
up
this
beer
holds
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
it
has
recently
been
rebranded
as
maple
shack
cream
ale
but
i
prefer
the
reference
to
kits
beach
i
first
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
granville
tasting
room
many
years
ago
it
is
a
tasty
brew
nuts
caramel
and
maple
flavours
pop
up
there
is
little
hop
complexity
or
depth
overall
its
definitely
sessionable
and
one
of
the
few
beers
my
wife
will
drink
the
maple
character
is
the
unique
feature
in
this
session
ale
unfortunate
the
beer
itself
doesnt
do
the
best
job
of
acting
as
a
showcase
for
it
flavourful
base
hops
are
mostly
earthy
uk
varieties
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
a
great
style
watery
and
some
cheap
hallmarks
in
the
feel
not
particularly
interesting
or
balanced
pours
a
red
amber
with
a
few
fingers
of
light
caramel
colored
foam
aroma
is
sweetish
with
bready
pale
malts
and
light
toffeebrown
sugar
coming
to
the
fore
along
with
a
touch
of
sour
fruit
not
a
lot
of
maple
palate
is
mild
mellow
and
smooth
less
aggressive
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
pronounced
apple
flavor
along
with
a
whiff
of
citrus
and
some
herbal
notes
from
the
hops
i
assume
an
unassuming
caramel
sweetness
biscuit
and
hints
of
cardboard
and
booze
there
are
flaws
but
overall
drinkable
if
overrated
in
my
immediate
circle
you
know
who
you
are
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
amber
hue
with
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
apples
and
hint
of
maple
syrup
body
is
medium
creamy
and
smooth
taste
is
of
caramel
maple
syrup
and
hint
of
herbal
hops
finish
is
long
and
semidry
interesting
brew
final
thoughts
all
in
all
it
works
well
although
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
an
epic
implementation
of
maple
syrup
and
beer
maybe
if
somehow
the
malt
was
upped
and
the
metal
took
off
it
would
be
a
better
grade
still
think
its
pretty
good
though
and
worth
a
shot
im
discovering
granville
island
brewing
makes
decent
session
beers
this
cream
ale
pours
an
amber
colour
with
half
a
pinkies
worth
of
head
smells
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
faint
hint
of
maple
and
vanilla
tastes
a
bit
weaker
than
it
smells
i
was
hoping
for
more
maple
flavour
overall
a
decent
session
ale
that
i
could
see
pairing
or
cooking
with
bbq
ribs
overall
though
for
a
cream
ale
ive
had
much
better
and
again
if
you
put
a
flavor
on
the
bottle
and
i
cant
even
smell
or
taste
it
then
i
am
just
not
impressed
it
is
drinkable
though
ill
give
it
that
nice
looking
amber
beer
with
a
decent
head
that
lasted
a
couple
minutes
inviting
smell
with
a
good
smooth
taste
and
a
nice
malty
finish
i
found
the
maple
flavor
to
be
very
faint
yet
natural
tasting
would
definitely
buy
again
as
its
an
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer

in
the
mouth
good
on
the
tongue
the
smell
of
maple
is
present
and
then
the
taste
of
vanilla
and
caramel
are
present
for
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
this
is
the
first
maple
syrup
flavoured
beer
ive
had
that
actually
had
a
maple
taste
that
i
could
define
in
it
and
i
intend
to
find
it
again
in
the
future
overall
a
very
nice
offering
from
gib
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
maple
flavour
in
the
beer
but
pleased
that
the
maple
wasnt
over
kill
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
not
bad
if
its
cold
and
youre
thirsty
not
offensive
in
any
way
just
a
little
watery
for
me
good
and
very
sweet
cream
ale
something
you
should
try
at
least
once
on
tap
full
flavored
but
creamy
and
smooth
only
downfal
is
the
sweetness
could
prevent
you
from
drinking
all
night
but
a
good
beer
to
sample
d
yeah
i
think
i
will
pick
up
a
sixer
from
time
to
time
of
this
beer
its
good
enough
to
warrant
2
or
3
before
moving
on
as
i
could
see
my
palate
tiring
of
the
maple
flavor
but
it
is
refreshing
nonetheless
as
it
finishes
dry
and
without
a
real
lingering
aftertaste
good
job
lost
of
hype
behind
granville
being
back
in
alberta
decent
beers
and
something
different
d
the
maple
is
there
but
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
the
flavour
is
malt
weighted
feel
generally
matches
the
style
although
it
sits
a
little
heavy
despite
the
good
carbonation
but
all
in
all
a
good
attempt
at
mixing
two
canadian
stereotypes
d
this
is
a
tasty
maple
ale
with
flavours
that
are
present
but
not
overpowering
the
subtle
flavours
make
it
easily
sessionable
but
also
leave
you
faint
reminders
of
the
maple
presence
another
goto
ale
that
would
be
appreciated
by
most
cream
ale
fans
very
good
brew
happy
i
tried
it
it
recd
high
marks
from
others
around
the
table
too
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
this
one
again
i
dont
know
what
happened
to
the
overtly
sweet
but
generally
balanced
mapleflavoured
beer
that
i
used
to
enjoy
back
in
the
midoughts
try
saying
that
without
sounding
like
grandpa
simpson
its
strange
to
say
but
this
recently
revived
beer
needs
to
actually
be
sweeter
and
the
eponymous
flavour
needs
to
at
least
put
in
more
than
a
mere
cameo
however
im
hardly
surprised
at
the
current
overall
direction
of
this
brewerys
offerings
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
d
not
great
reminds
me
of
an
urmarzen
my
least
favorite
beer
couldnt
finish
this
one
i
poured
it
but
before
i
could
take
note
the
head
had
disappeared
okay
lets
call
it
no
head
the
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
the
nose
was
very
sweet
with
a
definite
maple
sugar
presence
mouthfeel
was
medium
at
best
with
very
little
carbonation
in
evidence
the
taste
on
the
tongue
was
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
as
one
might
expect
from
a
maple
beer
finish
was
sweet
but
tempered
by
a
slight
sourness
on
the
extreme
finish
not
my
bag
the
drinkability
ah
well
this
is
a
toughie
for
me
because
im
sure
that
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
my
girlfriends
who
arent
so
crazy
about
things
that
resemble
hops
barley
malt
or
hmmm
beer
for
myself
i
really
enjoyed
a
pint
for
its
individuality
but
i
could
never
finish
a
pitcher
of
this
not
a
bad
beer
but
1
maybe
2
is
enough
no
more
definately
worth
a
try
this
beer
had
more
of
a
hop
profile

though
not
assertive
by
any
means

than
i
was
anticipating
and
started
nicely
bitter
the
malt
kicked
in
and
turned
things
sweet
after
that
the
maple
taste
was
a
little
more
evident
but
not
overdone
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
and
not
as
creamy
as
it
could
have
been
nevertheless
one
could
easily
knock
a
few
of
these
back
if
its
to
your
liking
taste
isnt
really
unpleasant
a
nutty
malt
character
a
slight
acidity
and
a
little
bit
of
woody
earthiness
apples
caramel
pears
are
all
evident
a
pleasant
roasted
character
comes
through
more
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
the
maple
theres
really
very
little
in
the
way
of
bitterness
here
but
its
not
overly
sweet
either
to
its
credit
this
could
have
gone
a
bad
way
as
i
think
many
brewers
would
go
out
of
their
way
to
make
this
as
mapley
as
possible
instead
granville
island
takes
the
subtle
route
to
good
results
mouthfeel
is
very
british
maybe
a
bit
watery
but
certainly
not
overcarbonated
and
very
creamy
i
remember
having
a
lot
of
pints
of
this
when
i
lived
in
vancouver
back
before
i
was
a
ba
and
enjoying
it
coming
back
to
it
wasnt
really
a
terrible
disappointment
a
very
drinkable
cream
ale
and
does
well
in
the
style
nicely
done
i
am
warming
up
to
the
artful
use
of
honey
in
well
crafted
beers
it
works
drinkability
quaffable
this
one
gives
the
impression
that
it
is
meant
to
be
a
straightforward
and
easy
to
drink
beer
and
in
the
end
it
succeeds
at
it
worth
a
try
but
not
likely
to
rock
anyones
world
final
statement
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
this
beer
was
a
treat
and
i
highly
recommend
it
do
not
let
the
maple
label
convince
you
its
a
novelty
beer
it
has
lasting
power
i
can
easily
drink
these
regularly
i
had
this
bottle
in
the
fridge
for
the
last
five
months
and
lo
and
behold
it
improved
the
flavour
the
beer
dried
out
some
so
the
sweetness
was
all
but
gone
what
impressed
me
was
the
malt
structure
was
pretty
solid
imho
this
is
the
best
of
the
regular
gi
offerings
easy
drinking
flavourful
food
freiendly
and
well
structured
this
is
a
pretty
looking
beer
pours
a
small
light
tan
head
nice
lacing
as
for
smell
mostly
malt
with
the
maple
creeping
in
there
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
taste
is
quite
smooth
creamy
yes
malts
maple
is
very
evident
not
much
hops
though
a
little
sweet
but
in
a
good
way
carbonation
is
near
perfect
for
this
beer
it
feels
quite
nice
in
your
mouth
its
actually
pretty
good
something
different
from
the
average
pub
fare
around
vancouver
and
its
cheap
around
here
nothing
too
challenging
or
rewarding
here
though
a
nice
winter
beer
goes
well
with
a
nice
steak
ill
drink
it
again
taste
is
not
overly
sweet
a
bit
of
hops
balances
out
the
malts
and
the
maple
syrup
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
however
it
is
a
little
cloying
on
the
tongue
and
is
a
bit
thick
like
maple
syrup
not
bad
one
id
buy
again
but
only
when
the
mood
strikes
me
dvery
smooth
maple
hinted
beer
that
is
very
thirst
quenching
tetnanger
hops
stated
on
the
bottle
gave
it
more
depth
than
a
typical
cream
ale
not
very
exciting
but
tasty
enough
it
recalls
something
like
jw
dundees
honey
brown
or
some
gateway
beer
of
that
nature
not
challenging
on
the
palate
but
easy
enough
to
drink
a
decent
first
beer
from
the
province
of
british
columbia
sampled
ontap
at
the
gi
brewery
its
brownishred
with
a
smallish
head
the
maple
makes
its
presence
known
in
the
smell
but
is
not
overwhelming
hops
are
barely
detectable
in
the
smell
unfortunately
the
maple
becomes
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
taste
especially
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
it
seems
a
bit
thin
for
a
cream
ale
the
sweetness
detracts
from
the
drinkability
its
worthy
of
a
try
but
dont
expect
anything
spectacular
the
appearance
of
this
ale
is
superb
following
the
pour
there
is
a
small
though
healthylooking
head
which
recedes
to
a
creamy
thin
layer
which
in
my
opinion
looks
very
good
on
a
glass
of
britishstyle
ale
coppery
reddish
and
chestnut
colours
add
to
the
appearance
and
although
this
ale
is
clear
it
is
denseit
does
not
look
insubstantial
or
weak
the
aroma
is
malt
with
a
definite
sweetness
that
is
the
pure
canadian
maple
syrup
as
the
bottles
label
states
slight
as
well
although
it
seems
to
be
under
cover
however
the
taste
is
a
bit
burnt
up
front
and
i
think
ive
been
a
bit
too
hard
on
it
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
bold
and
hearty
ale
thanks
for
the
bottle
barry
o
the
every
mans
beer
for
knocking
around
when
some
crisp
refreshment
is
needed
coon
rock
doesnt
aim
to
impress
with
crazy
specialty
malts
or
hop
additions
its
just
a
simpleton
simple
tasty
and
refreshing
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
a
thin
white
fizzy
head
on
top
that
settling
into
a
scattered
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
and
minimal
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
grassy
smells
similar
to
some
german
lagers
out
there
not
typically
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
cream
ale
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
decent
graininess
to
it
the
finish
has
a
subtle
bitterness
to
it
but
nothing
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
easy
to
drink
and
moderately
refreshing
overall
its
a
decent
cream
ale
i
feel
that
it
should
be
so
grassy
though
it
should
be
more
sweet
on
the
nose
and
less
lagerlike
coon
rock
cream
ale
aint
too
shabby
at
all
its
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
pretty
good
coon
rock
is
certainly
more
viscous
and
lightly
carbed
than
one
might
expect
from
the
style
the
sugar
cookie
sweetness
is
quite
modest
though
and
the
light
vanilla
presence
sets
it
off
nicely
a
bit
of
juicy
citrus
midswallow
and
then
a
touch
tangy
a
touch
grainy
in
the
finish
a
better
than
average
cream
ale
poured
out
a
translucent
pilsner
straw
yellow
color
but
with
only
a
fizzle
of
weak
collar
for
a
head
no
lacing
smells
of
mineral
water
light
amounts
of
sweet
corn
perhaps
a
crystal
malt
not
sure
about
that
one
and
a
nice
accent
of
herbal
grassy
hops
flavor
is
like
the
nose
but
also
contains
a
medium
strength
bready
element
that
pleases
my
palate
lighter
bodied
but
not
watery
thank
goodness
well
carbonated
not
as
corny
as
spotted
cow
but
somewhat
more
barebones
minimalist
as
well
very
sessionable
beer
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
bright
white
head
aroma
was
corn
taste
was
very
similar
to
an
adjunct
lager
not
very
assertive
in
flavor
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
drinkability
very
high
overall
i
was
fairly
dissappointed
with
this
one
taste
was
too
much
like
a
bud
miller
coors
product
but
at
a
much
higher
price
these
types
of
beers
definitely
have
their
place
but
are
available
at
much
lower
cost
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
usually
in
a
6pack
it
is
one
of
the
decent
cream
ales
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
nice
cream
ale
its
not
boring
as
i
have
found
others
of
this
style
to
prove
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
and
if
i
knew
the
abv
it
might
even
fit
into
the
sessionable
realm
drinkabiliy
solid
for
the
style
but
i
couldnt
get
into
it
definitely
not
on
par
with
spotted
cow
served
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
white
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
the
nose
is
really
blank
with
a
very
mild
amount
of
light
bread
plus
some
very
faint
hops
taste
is
bread
with
a
very
mild
amount
of
bitterness
light
body
drinks
well
enough
but
nothing
special
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
color
was
a
somewhat
lighter
golden
yellow
smell
was
good
mouthfeel
was
good
unlike
my
last
cream
ale
this
one
had
a
more
distinctive
creamier
taste
to
it
i
paired
it
with
a
white
bean
chicken
chili
which
no
doubt
enhanced
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
still
not
as
enjoyable
at
the
old
blatz
light
cream
ale
from
a
decade
or
more
ago
but
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
light
creamy
taste
that
is
wellsuited
for
warmer
days
while
not
the
most
flavorful
cream
ale
ive
ever
had
this
wasnt
horrible
or
anything
either
easy
flavors
and
feel
here
making
for
a
mostly
pleasant
quaff
poured
with
a
nice
white
head
that
pretty
much
settle
down
to
a
light
cover
and
some
lace
color
is
a
crystal
clear
yellow
aroma
is
beery
malty
light
hop
a
bit
of
yeast
and
some
grain
flavors
the
same
but
more
sweet
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
id
like
it
better
if
it
werent
quite
as
sweet
slight
bitterness
in
finish
i
will
say
the
sweetness
is
short
lived
and
that
helps
could
do
worse
for
a
session
beer
done
of
the
best
cream
ales
i
have
encountered
very
well
done
and
enjoyable
to
drink
pours
a
crystal
clear
color
with
a
mild
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
breaddough
as
well
as
pine
notes
taste
is
of
hop
bitterness
followed
by
smooth
and
sweet
bread
and
honey
notes
excellent
mouthfeel
finishes
extremely
smooth
slightly
hazed
sun
yellow
body
it
glows
yellow
thin
bubbly
cap
of
dirty
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
malty
a
little
bready
almost
like
a
german
pilsner
kicked
down
one
notch
in
the
aroma
department
flavor
is
top
notch
for
the
style
a
cream
ale
that
has
some
substance
i
like
it
sweet
malty
tones
with
no
signs
of
corn
or
other
adjuncts
slight
hay
like
bitterness
lingering
after
the
taste
adds
another
dimension
and
alludes
to
a
slight
dry
impression
with
the
aftertaste
body
is
medium
to
mediumfull
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
nice
achievement
here
with
this
style
id
drink
it
often
if
it
were
available
around
here
mouthfeel
is
creamy
soft
but
full
very
drinkable
best
thing
about
it
could
have
several
must
be
around
4
5

believe
will
be
seeking
a
six
pack
next
time

with

high

overall
an
average
cream
ale
with
a

hurt
by
the
high
carbonation

d
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
the
carbonation
level
provides
for
a
good
balance
between
the
fruity
side
of
this
beer
and
the
maltgrain
side
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
corn
and
faint
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
the
corniest
of
any
beer
ive
ever
tried
it
is
a
sharp
lingering
flavor
that
simply
doesnt
work
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
i
cant
see
myself
ever
drinking
this
again
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
a
lighterthanlight
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
in
fact
this
beer
had
the
thickest
head
id
ever
seen
because
it
was
extremely
overcarbonated
i
didnt
even
pour
a
third
of
it
into
the
glass
without
the
foam
reaching
the
top
aroma
of
fruity
esters
and
lime
light
bodied
watery
taste
with
faint
malt
sweetness
hints
of
corn
and
minature
hop
aftertaste
once
most
of
the
carbonation
was
gone
and
i
could
actually
taste
this
beer
instead
of
the
bubbles
it
was
still
not
very
good
decidedly
average
and
reminiscent
of
takeyourpick
cheap
macro
lager
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
fairly
forgettable
hopefully
lake
louie
has
more
interesting
options
d
its
not
as
crisp
as
some
beers
in
the
same
style
but
its
a
clean
thirst
quencher
that
has
a
great
mouthfeel
that
lives
up
to
the
name
it
also
has
a
great
ability
to
deliver
a
good
flavor
consistently
until
the
last
drop
some
lower
abv
ales
of
this
style
can
start
to
taste
weak
and
watery
a
fine
brew
md
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
clean
well
carbonated
beer
an
incredible
easy
drinker
that
would
be
a
very
good
session
ale
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
prickly
along
the
tongue
with
sweetness
some
candy
corn
and
lemon
lingering
into
a
slick
dry
finish
d
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
beer
the
flavor
while
simple
has
some
nice
depth
and
a
good
balance
of
grain
and
hops
dcould
drink
this
cutting
the
lawn
as
many
have
said
definitely
not
a
go
to
beer
for
me
its
an
ok
beer
but
not
really
what
i
like
to
drink
the
taste
is
good
once
you
get
past
the
smell
and
appearance
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
tiny
filmy
white
head
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
peaty
light
malt
and
astringent
bitterness
the
flavor
is
corn
light
citrus
grassy
pepper
and
light
honey
abrupt
light
sweet
finish
light
bodied
creamy
texture
kind
of
a
mix
of
styles
imho
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
basic
brew
without
much
complexity
but
good
proportioning
could
be
a
bit
heavier
in
body
which
would
compliment
the
cream
and
malt
poured
a
light
straw
color
slight
scent
of
lemon
in
the
head
but
nothing
that
gets
me
excited
mild
carbination
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
cream
my
least
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
that
my
mouth
has
a
similar
taste
as
if
i
had
just
drank
a
macrobrewed
lager
my
first
beer
from
lake
louie
perhaps
not
the
best
intro
to
their
beers
this
beer
pours
slightly
hazy
not
a
big
deal
because
i
recommend
decanting
this
beer
into
a
glass
due
to
yeast
sediment
on
the
bottom
lightstraw
in
color
with
not
much
of
an
aroma
of
hops
or
malt
very
little
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
in
body
defnitely
a
summer
brew
way
more
palatable
than
the
genessee
cream
ale
i
had
earlier
tonight
probably
sessionable
but
not
interesting
enough
to
find
out
wont
be
trying
it
again
spotted
cow
is
better
in
my
opinion
the
beer
had
a
pleasant
enough
appearance
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
fairly
spritelike
head
aroma
was
rather
sweet
like
candy
sugar
and
that
was
the
primary
component
of
the
flavor
as
well
not
a
lot
of
hoppiness
or
maltiness
and
no
addon
flavors
like
fruitiness
chocolate
toffee
coffee
etc
mouthfeel
was
unremarkable
not
bad
i
finished
the
bottle
but
not
something
id
be
in
a
rush
to
have
again
d
easy
drinking
as
it
lacks
body
and
is
a
bit
thin
a
nice
summer
brew
to
suck
back
possibly
a
great
session
brew
while
sweating
in
the
sun
d
this
one
is
not
bad
but
does
not
stand
out
either
it
might
be
all
the
miller
and
busch
i
drank
in
college
but
i
just
do
not
care
for
any
beer
nowadays
that
has
a
big
corn
presence
this
just
isnt
my
style
of
beer
so
i
cant
say
much
about
getting
behind
this
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
3
12
white
head
over
the
clear
golden
brew
gave
it
some
time
for
things
to
settle
down
head
calms
to
a
meringey
inch
of
froth
with
sporadic
artful
lacing
aroma
is
defined
by
a
lightly
tart
and
fruity
essence
flavor
is
tart
and
bitter
with
little
to
no
pale
malts
character
at
all
mouthfeel
is
nowhere
near
as
smooth
as
i
look
for
cream
ales
to
be
with
drinkability
just
not
that
great
in
my
book
have
to
try
this
one
again
maybe
i
was
unlucky
with
a
bottle
this
time
single
bottle
purchased
at
rileys
and
consumed
in
madison
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
solid
testaceous
color
with
a
finger
of
white
compact
head
clarity
is
almost
perfect
and
there
is
an
enormous
cascade
of
bubbles
in
the
brew
taking
a
sniff
i
get
very
mild
aroma
in
this
one
there
is
a
light
corn
sweetness
very
faint
lemony
kiss
and
a
mild
husky
grain
im
really
having
to
work
to
get
any
arom
on
this
one
other
than
some
corn
sweetness
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
aroma
good
corn
and
husky
grain
flavors
though
not
offensive
and
abbrasive
huskyness
with
a
light
lemon
zest
on
the
finish
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
coming
in
the
finish
as
well
this
one
is
very
straitforward
but
there
is
nowhere
to
hide
any
flaws
much
of
what
i
expect
in
a
cream
ale
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
very
solid
moderate
carbonation
that
makes
this
one
very
lively
i
enjoy
the
way
the
bittering
hop
hits
late
in
the
finish
keeping
it
from
being
a
focus
but
letting
me
know
it
is
there
as
i
go
for
another
sip
this
is
a
fairly
simple
beer
in
my
mind
but
they
do
it
well
a
solid
cream
ale
a
summer
quencher
for
sure
to
be
enjoyed
when
ever
where
ever
within
the
dog
days
of
summer
gone
in
to
time
and
another
is
just
as
easy
to
down
even
though
ive
still
only
had
a
handful
of
their
offerings
i
dont
believe
that
ive
had
so
much
as
a
mediocre
lake
louie
beer
coon
rock
is
a
delicious
treat
and
deserves
much
wider
distribution
if
you
think
that
all
cream
ales
are
bland
and
uninteresting
theres
a
great
little
brewery
in
wisconsin
that
would
love
to
change
your
mind
drinkability
its
a
cream
ale
it
can
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
uf
nothing
special
butthe
masses
will
like
this
one
perhaps
this
is
louies
retirement
fund
who
knows
my
advise
is
to
skip
this
one
and
stick
with
the
scotch
aleor
the
porteror
thewellany
of
louies
other
beers
theyre
just
about
the
best
out
there
picked
this
up
on
the
way
out
of
madison
yesterday
a
64
ounce
growler
from
rileys
this
is
the
oddestlooking
beer
ive
ever
seen
almost
colorless
the
closest
thing
ive
seen
to
it
is
new
glaruss
totally
naked
though
it
looks
like
very
slightly
goldtinted
water
its
not
unattractive
it
has
excellent
lacing
and
bubble
action
really
doesnt
smell
like
much
at
all
taste
isnt
bold
by
any
means
but
subtlely
sweet
with
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
is
barely
there
at
all
coon
rapids
cream
ale
the
phantom
beer
64
ounce
growler
this
beer
pours
out
a
dull
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
bready
aroma
it
could
be
my
imagination
but
i
think
i
can
smell
the
corn
alcohol
becomes
noticable
in
the
nose
as
the
beer
warms
though
i
doubt
the
abv
is
very
high
biscuity
malt
flavor
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
although
this
is
not
a
very
hoppy
style
of
beer
i
think
this
beer
could
use
some
more
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
although
this
beer
is
sweet
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
just
as
a
beer
its
nothing
special
drinkability
was
high
even
dave
could
probably
session
this
one
all
night
another
winner
from
lake
louie
awesome
summer
quaffer
just
about
anyone
will
be
able
to
enjoy
this
one
