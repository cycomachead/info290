you

this
again
good

decent
apa
but
a

hard
to

malt

need
a

adjusting
interestingly
seems
like
a

with
a
sweeter

taste
appreciate
a

yeasty
taste
and
like
the
hoppy
ending

generally
at
times
a

rough
nice
color
thin

generic
flavor
meh
i
would
call
this
an
above
average
example
on
an
apa
it
is
darker
and
has
a
bit
more
hops
presence
than
i
usually
associate
with
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
being
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of

not
one
id
drink
a

of
bought
from

from

included

the

pale
ale
wish
i
had
more
than
6
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
i
had
it
in
a
gi
flight
pack
and
found
myself
wishing
i
had
more
than
three
found
it
to
be
better
than
its
average
and
am
not
generally
a
fan
of
pale
ale
deep
clear
amber
with
average
head
a
very
solid
strongish
pale
ale
with
good
balance
but
a
definitely
strong
hops
profile
i
would
have
called
it
an
ipa
overall
an
earthy
pale
ale
pretty
standard
would
probably
be
great
locally
on
tap
but
hasnt
traveled
well
down
to
texas
its
a
new
label
we
may
have
had
old
stock
dumped
on
us
a
fine
pale
ale
but
i
had
higher
hopes
its
caramel
colored
body
shows
me
right
away
that
this
thing
is
going
to
be
balanced
by
bigger
malts
until
maybe
too
high
a
level
and
i
was
right
although
the
look
is
nice
clear
and
bright
and
holding
over
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
less
exciting
certainly
less
sexy
the
grain
is
a
little
big
and
a
little
sweet
for
the
hops
and
even
without
an
english
yeast
profile
it
almost
tastes
like
an
english
pale
because
of
the
malts
and
more
bitterness
than
other
flavors
coming
from
the
hops
still
its
crispy
and
refreshing
and
not
sweet
in
the
taste
i
appreciate
that
part
but
i
want
a
little
more
out
of
my
hops
in
an
american
pale
than
this
beer
offers
more
bitter
and
grassy
than
anything
else
light
feel
is
nice
though
and
unexpected
for
the
color
this
drinks
real
easy
almost
watered
down
or
something
medium
carbonation
is
fine
overall
not
the
best
of
goose
island
here
but
their
larger
batch
stuff
so
rarely
is
impressive
anymore
still
i
always
buy
their
beer
when
i
see
it
too
much
good
beer
they
do
to
not
try
everything
a
solid
if
a
little
boring
session
right
here
ten
hills
pale
ale
brewed
by
goose
island
beer
co
with
an
abv
of
6
20
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
malts
and
hops
now
for
the
taste
it
is
bold
with
hops
you
pick
up
on
a
few
grains
and
malts
in
this
brew
ten
hills
pale
ale
has
a
decent
balance
to
it
if
you
do
not
like
hops
this
not
the
brew
for
you
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
with
flavor
but
this
ale
has
a
smooth
aftertaste
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
over
all
im
giving
ten
hills
pale
ale
a
solid
4
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
a
4
for
ten
hills
pale
ale
goose
island
beer
co
for
a
hoppy
beer
this
is
smooth
and
very
sessionable
ok
offering
from
goose
island
but
this
beer
fails
when
compared
to
other
beers
from
goose
a
decent
pale
ale
for
sure
i
just
tend
to
like
my
pales
ales
a
little
more
hop
forward
bordering
on
ipa
territory
at
first
i
was
thinking
i
wished
i
had
tried
this
one
before
committing
to
an
entire
6
pack
but
then
again
on
second
thought
the
drinkability
is
definitely
high
so
it
wont
be
a
chore
polishing
them
off
in
a
couple
days
taste
is
light
and
hippy
with
a
background
sweetness
nice
malt
balance
to
even
the
beer
out
and
make
solid
in
the
drinkability
category
clear
copper
pour
with
thin
clingy
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
and
plums
hop
flavor
starts
with
malt
becoming
apparent
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
lingering
semisweet
herbal
flavor
pretty
good
stuff
average
beer
from
gi
brewery
beers
seem
average
alright
goose
island
brews
great
beer
my
reviews
of
said
suds
are
consistently
positive
ten
hills
is
a
total
hang
out
pale
ale
smooth
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
finish
kinda
like
a
carbonated
tootsie
roll
and
if
you
eat
with
a
decently
spiced
chili
you
wont
go
wrong
good
balance
of
hops
n
malt
smooth
finish
not
that
i
was
beginning
to
develop
bmc
level
disregard
for
anything
not
bcbs
and
variants
from
gi
but
at
the
same
time
i
wasnt
setting
my
expectations
very
high
either
what
i
got
in
return
was
a
beauty
of
apa
from
its
near
perfect
lacing
and
deep
copper
to
the
floral
yet
a
dash
citrusy
nose
this
was
setting
up
to
be
a
nice
treat
taste
followed
the
nose
in
that
the
floral
nature
came
shining
through
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
maybe
a
tiny
blast
of
tart
trying
to
peak
through
the
otherwise
very
well
balanced
malt
profile
finally
no
cloying
sweetness
or
lingering
off
bitterness
in
an
amazingly
dry
finish
excuse
me
now
while
i
plan
my
trip
back
to
tw
to
get
more
of
these
seriously
nice
unexpected
awesomeness
from
gi
o
overall
good
although
nothing
necessarily
spectacular
id
drink
it
again
but
there
are
certainly
other
pale
ales
on
the
shelf
id
probably
pick
over
it
still
decent
malt
profile
and
i
could
see
putting
down
a
few
of
these
during
a
summer
bbq
a
pretty
decent
beer
pretty
balanced
not
over
hopped
pours
a
clear
copper

23
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of

malt
sweet
malt
hops
rye
and
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale

mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
rye
hops
hint
of
citrus
sweet

caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of

overall
good

decent

and
decent

o
an
okay
pale
ale
malts
are
right
there
with
the
hops
neither
one
overpowering
the
other
some
wheaty
character
come
through
in
the
ale
overall
a
decent
take
on
a
pale

nice
earthy
hops
upfront
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
backing
very
nice
bright
hoppy
taste
smells
of
citrus
and
pine
needles
smooth
and
flavorful
just
dances
on
your
tongue
deceptively
easy
to
drink
given
its
higher
abv
bottled
on
11614
i
thoughts
this
tasted
a
lot
like
deschutes
fresh
squeezed
ipa
another
one
of
my
favorites
wonderfully
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
fresh
tasting
pale
almost
an
ipa
in
flavor
nice
hoppy
flavor
and
a
little
boozy
for
6
2
i
like
it
not
bad
the
aroma
had
me
fairly
excited
at
first
but
the
malts
and
a
fair
sweetness
combine
to
distract
from
the
freshness
of
the
hops
solid
but
not
all
that
noteworthy
real
fun
pale
ale
very
solid
and
drinkable
and
delicious
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
easy
drinker
this
is
a
nice
balanced
pale
ale
not
overly
hoppy
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
slightly
bitter
a
nice
holiday
beer
the
malt
could
have
been
more
substantial
but
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitter
finish
to
this
offering
this
beer
is
not
retired
at
least
in
chicago
long
live
the
10
hills
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
malts
up
front
some
light
hops
drinks
almost
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
but
one
was
enough
for
me
i
hope
this
isnt
a
one
and
done
with
goose
island
a
very
pleasant
beer
nice
orangereddish
hue
with
a
good
amount
of
head
the
smell
was
very
grassy
with
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
subdued
with
the
hops
but
still
had
a
crisp
finish
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
fizzy
and
very
refreshing
hope
to
try
this
one
again
soon
if
possible
perhaps
my
tastebuds
dont
appreciate
pale
ales
and
ipas
properly
but
i
have
yet
to
find
one
of
either
category
that
i
like
they
taste
like
soapy
water
mixed
with
intolerably
bitter
hops
in
my
opinion
could
barely
finish
goose
islands
ten
hills
pale
ale
with
every
sip
becoming
harsher
and
harsher
in
terms
of
flavoring
perhaps
im
just
not
one
for
these
kinds
of
beers
however
i
can
at
least
appreciate
that
more
time
effort
and
labor
goes
into
these
than
your
average
macrobrew
as
usual
im
stuck
at
the
corner
of
admiration
and
recognition
rather
than
actual
appreciation
interestingly
i
get
a
bevy
of
hops
on
the
nose
but
those
are
not
what
i
get
in
the
taste
at
least
immediately
those
roasted
pale
malts
jump
in
first
and
then
the
hops
find
a
way
to
introduce
themselves
later
overall
a
really
nice
beer
i
wish
it
was
a
year
round
offering
o
malty
and
watery
not
a
good
combo
nice
caramel
hue
with
a
lace
of
thin
wispy
head
caramel
malt
aroma
under
a
piney
lupilin
and
lemon
the
flavor
is
easy
tea
leaf
malt
pine
lemon
and
a
resiny
hop
the
feel
is
carbonated
and
abrasive
thin
and
harsh
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
the
feel
is
simply
too
harsh
overall
very
good
beer
definatly
would
have
this
one
again
fee
medium
body
is
smooth
with
modestly
lively
carbonation
on
tap
at
district
13
in
hollywood
calif
which
is
worth
a
visit
to
help
fortify
you
against
the
dreadful
surroundings
notes
from
25
feb
2014
visit
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
could
even
be
described
as
light
as
it
seems
to
swing
back
and
forth
between
the
two
with
a
dry
crisp
feel
this
beer
drinks
similar
to
a
pilsner
in
my
defense
it
actually
was
my
day
off
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunrise
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
somewhat
mild
pine
sap
light
grass
light
flowers
and
mild
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
pine
kinda
blunt
but
still
mild
enough
to
the
point
that
it
doesnt
matter
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
little
pale
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
at
all
but
its
drinkable
otoo
malty
for
an
apa
needed
more
of
a
hop
presence
im
not
sure
how
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
but
i
was
intrigued
by
the
story
of
the
hops
involved
in
this
beer
the
result
is
indeed
interesting
but
its
not
very
special
beyond
that
worth
a
try
despite
being
only
brewed
once
its
still
around
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
huge
frothy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
leaving
stickies
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
earth
pine
and
sulfur
the
flavor
is
sweet
rich
caramel
and
toffee
with
just
enough
earthy
pine
to
provide
a
break
in
the
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
creamy
bubbly
mouthfeel
english
inspired
brew
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
carry
on
citizens
pours
amberhoney
colored
with
thick
foamy
head
that
persists
through
drinking
excellent
lacing
on
sides
of
glass
citrus
aroma
with
hints
of
apple
and
pine
very
hop
forward
taste
that
persists
through
drinking
the
taste
is
very
piney
but
you
can
discern
some
citrus
qualities
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
apa
i
have
had
but
is
definitely
one
i
would
drink
again
mouth
is
semithick
and
a
bit
slick
it
is
a
bit
too
much
abv
to
session
but
it
is
easy
to
throw
back
several
i
would
like
to
see
this
one
as
a
full
time
offering
o
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
it
will
never
replace
snpa
as
my
go
to
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
another
one
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
pale
ale
by
any
means
but
was
just
not
the
hop
profile
i
prefer
goose
island
makes
a
lot
of
good
beers
but
i
probably
will
not
but
this
one
again
overall
pretty
standard
pale
ale
more
british
than
american
easy
and
enjoyable
pours
a
copperorange
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lasted
through
the
drinking
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
various
hops
and
grains
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
slight
citrus
and
floral
coming
through
but
ends
with
a
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
seems
to
get
stronger
with
each
sip
ended
up
pouring
about
half
of
it
out
since
it
was
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
the
citrus
pine
hit
me
at
first
sip
but
subsequently
mellows
out
strong
after
taste
would
be
better
with
a
food
pairing
the
pale
ale
label
ignored
not
quite
the
bitterness
a
decent
taste
not
sure
if
i
would
like
to
drink
a
few
of
them
though
due
to
the
heavy
aftertaste
may
buy
again
next
year
its
very
one
dimensional
but
it
tastes
good
the
medium
body
holds
it
up
pretty
well
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
crispness
is
consistent
it
starts
off
with
a
smoothness
that
continues
most
of
the
way
but
fades
out
at
the
end
of
the
sip
pours
to
pint
glass
copper
orange
color
bit
of
caramel
malt
on
nose
well
balanced
flavor
this
bottle
is
about
2
5
month
old
and
the
hops
are
fresh
enough
but
i
think
even
fresher
this
mightve
been
more
hoppy
but
where
its
at
sits
well
with
me
fair
amt
of
dryness
overall
a
decent
refreshing
beer
i
enjoyed
the
malt
forward
flavor
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
that
wasnt
overpowering
a
decent
pale
ale
the
mix
of
malts
and
hops
seems
kind
of
even
at
least
not
leaning
towards
the
hops
which
i
would
prefer
turns
out
to
be
a
fairly
easy
drinker
though
kind
of
a
malty
sweetness
seems
to
dominate
the
ride
a
nice
drinker
though
nothing
really
memorable
i
think
ill
forget
about
this
one
within
the
next
say
12
hours
if
goose
island
did
as
well
it
wouldnt
hurt
either
overall
balanced
and
tasty
a
nice
pale
ale
paired
with
the
mozzarella
sticks
tasty
maybe
middle
of
the
road
but
it
has
a
really
nice
array
of
flavors
with
no
peaks
just
enjoyment
nice
beer
overall
this
is
like
you
are
eating
a
flower
my
wife
loves
it
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
its
different
and
thats
pretty
cool
the
fact
that
my
wife
enjoys
it
is
a
big
plus
for
me
that
way
when
i
come
into
the
house
with
a
bunch
of
beer
i
can
tell
her
some
of
it
is
for
here
and
point
to
the
goose
island
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
surprisingly
dry
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
taste
starts
with
caramel
malt
then
a
hint
of
orange
and
musty
grapefruit
followed
by
hearty
bread
and
herbal
hops
has
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
ruins
the
flavor
a
bit
feel
is
heavier
than
average
with
expected
carbonation
for
an
apa
fruity
and
malty
apa
good
for
a
change
from
more
citric
intense
apa
i
picked
up
a
single
to
try
on
224
bottled
on
date
was
3
months
old
112213
so
i
was
leary
that
it
would
be
stale
not
at
all
with
this
pale
ale
very
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
with
a
crisp
slight
bittering
hop
note
finish
no
citrus
or
pine
bomb
at
all
with
this
one
i
found
this
goose
island
pale
ale
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
would
like
to
try
one
fresher
to
see
if
is
more
noticeable
hop
flavorings
besides
the
finish
recommend
highly
o
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
a
solid
ipa
that
could
be
an
every
day
drinker
but
i
cant
say
i
would
search
it
out
there
are
many
beers
that
fall
into
this
bracket
these
days
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
bottle
112313
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lace
smell
is
cut
grass
biscuit
caramel
and
pine
taste
what
you
expect
from
the
nose
a
little
grapefruit
that
i
didnt
get
from
the
nose
body
is
medium
plenty
of
life
a
touch
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
solid
seems
more
like
a
bitter
goose
islands
beers
have
always
been
tasty
and
this
one
is
no
different
in
that
sense
its
a
bit
different
for
a
pale
ale
tho
refreshingly
so
i
picked
this
up
in
a
mixed
12
pack
but
id
buy
another
sixer
if
i
found
one
o
all
in
all
i
liked
this
pale
ale
it
has
a
nice
hop
character
and
id
recommend
trying
it
overall
ok
but
nothing
too
special
the
noble
hops
mixed
with
some
base
american
hops
seem
to
get
kinda
boring
doesnt
really
do
anything
wrong
but
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
in
any
direction
malts
are
ok
btu
not
great
either
it
is
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
big
bitterness
but
fairly
meh
nice
hop
flavor
throughout
easygoing
and
quaffable
i
was
disapointed
by
this
beer
for
two
reasons
first
there
were
no
citrus
hop
notes
as
stated
by
the
label
my
guess
is
what
little
were
there
to
begin
with
were
drown
out
by
the
over
powering
herbal
hop
notes
personally
when
i
go
for
a
apa
which
i
like
very
much
i
wish
to
have
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
hop
flavor
in
it
secondly
i
am
extremely
disapointed
to
see
this
beer
was
bottled
in
baaldwinsville
ny
when
named
for
a
classic
chicago
neighborhood
i
live
a
couple
hours
outside
the
city
i
would
expect
a
local
brewery
to
brew
a
local
beer

with
a
billowing
sticky
one

white
head

color
and
head
aromas
of
grassy
and
leafy

with
a

of

leafy
and
mildly
citric
hops
at
the
onset
of
the
palate
that
dont
really
lingerlight
sweetness
from
caramelbiscuit
malts
not
a
complex
apa
but
not
badi
would
have
liked
more
hop
complexity
but
again
not
bad
overall
theres
something
about
the
taste
and
aroma
that
i
cannot
identify
that
makes
me
not
care
for
this
beer
much
o
this
is
a
decent
apa
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
i
am
surprised
i
expected
more
from
goose
island
but
it
is
still
a
solid
apa
overall
not
a
bad
ale
but
i
dont
think
i
will
revisit
sorry
goose
island
if
only
it
didnt
smell
so
bad
more
interesting
than
the
honker
ale
not
sure
if
its
better
oa
well
welcomed
new
brew
will
buy
again
so
refreshing
bold
flavor
yet
smooth
going
down
you
can
chug
like
a
lighter
colorpale
beer
or
sip
like
browndarker
brews
the
taste
was
the
highlight
of
the
beer
packs
enough
pine
and
citrus
to
be
labeled
a
full
on
ipa
rather
than
pale
ale
the
addition
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
bready
tastes
make
this
a
unique
multilayered
beer
i
can
see
ten
hills
pale
ale
becoming
a
yearround
offering
overall
a
pretty
generic
pale
ale
from
gi
here
i
picked
up
a
bottle
to
fill
out
my
mixed
6
pack
seems
on
the
border
between
english
pale
and
american
palenot
malty
enough
for
epa
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
apa
so
pretty
generic
pours
rich
copper
dark
but
see
through
white
foam
atop
citrus
malt
grass
trees
all
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
light
spicy
hop
kick
which
fades
into
a
subtle
sweetness
fresh
tasting
bright
little
bitter
sticks
in
at
the
end
nice
pale
juicy
nice
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
so
the
other
bottles
i
have
wont
be
a
chore
to
finish
but
i
would
not
buy
another
lot
of
ten
hills
recommended
especially
if
you
get
a
great
deal
on
them
these
were
8
99
for
6
o
fairly
straighforward
for
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
more
aromatics
and
herbal
would
be
better
this
one
doesnt
really
resonate
with
me
they
should
stick
to
english
or
belgian
style
ales
taste
is
a
wellbalanced
mesh
of
malty
sweetness
and
citrus
hoppiness
the
finish
has
a
slightly
bitter
twist
on
the
back
of
the
palate
but
overall
this
is
a
superb
pale
ale
and
one
id
have
no
trouble
revisiting
again
crystal
clear
and
light
apricot
colored
with
ruddy
edges
and
a
low
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
low
aroma
of
apple
and
pear
some
biscuity
malt
flavor
of
bready
malt
subtle
hops
honey
firm
bitterness
some
lemon
and
pepper
grassy
notes
moderate
mouthfeel
not
too
full
decent
beer
overall
but
not
among
this
producers
best
o
while
i
dont
drink
much
goose
island
craft
beer
i
saw
limited
release
on
the
bottle
along
with
a
hops
from
elf
mountain
farms
seemed
interesting
turns
out
elk
mountain
farms
is
anheuserbuschs
hop
farm
another
example
of
a
macro
brewer
pretending
to
be
micro
i
should
have
know
better
noticed
that
this
is
brewed
in
baldwinsville
btwso
its
more
anheuserbusch
than
goose
island
probably
i
was
expecting
more
from
gi
kind
of
a
harsh
bitter
taste
like
hops
extract
maybe
good
body
color
head
retention
just
not
an
entirely
pleasant
taste
bottled
on
date
7
nov
2013
about
70
days
old
o
i
liked
this
apa
a
little
better
than
expected
o
my
favorite
beer
from
goose
island
great
hop
flavors
prevail
in
a
drinkable
clean
ale
not
a
favorite
but
solid
overall
easy
drinking
ale
nice
flavor
profile
and
a
beer
you
can
have
a
few
of
in
a
session
medium
body
with
a
blast
of
dry
sticky
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
and
caramel
malt
backbone
into
a
slightly
boozy
bone
dry
finish
surprisingly
hop
forward
with
resinous
bitterness
grassy
pine
needle
and
spruce
tip
countered
by
subtle
citrustropical
fruit
sweetness
and
a
caramel
malt
backbone
some
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
sweetness
cutting
through
the
bitterness
along
with
caramel
toffee
light
fruit
bread
and
biscuit
only
6
2
but
theres
noticeable
boozy
heat
in
the
finish
slightly
taking
away
from
the
hop
flavors
decently
balanced
with
nice
bitterness
but
its
a
touch
too
boozy
for
my
liking
and
could
use
a
stronger
citrustropical
fruit
character
mouthfeel
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
not
too
thin
not
too
heavy
just
the
right
place
right
in
the
middle
well
done
beer
by
goose
island
taste
was
more
malt
forward
very
lightly
bitter
and
grassy
with
a
dried
orange
peel
note
light
bodied
supple
feel
fairly
smooth
though
the
carb
level
is
noticeably
moderate
overall
it
seems
to
have
lost
some
hop
nuance
or
maybe
it
wasnt
very
assertive
to
begin
with
nothing
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
but
it
washed
down
thai
food
well
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
american
pale
ale
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
with
it
not
having
anything
that
sets
it
apart
from
all
the
other
average
american
pale
ales
that
seem
to
flood
the
market
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
clean
crisp
not
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
could
see
myself
getting
bored
with
it
so
i
think
one
would
be
my
limit
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
pretty
nice
and
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
kind
of
generic
hop
flavor
and
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
i
think
those
were
the
two
weakest
points
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
might
order
a
pint
to
go
with
food
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
stocking
up
on
this
limited
release
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
as
good
american
pale
ale
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
all
in
all
i
thought
this
this
beer
fell
right
in
the
middle
of
the
style
it
wasnt
bad
and
there
wasnt
anything
offensive
about
it
but
it
wasnt
memorable
to
me
and
it
didnt
have
anything
that
made
it
stand
out
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
was
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
overall
a
decent
apa
but
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
i
wanted
to
try
this
as
it
is
goose
islands
first
widely
distributed
new
beer
since
the
abinbev
takeover
certainly
not
bad
but
does
not
even
come
close
to
unseating
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
as
the
best
widely
available
cheap
apa
on
the
market
offers
a
good
introduction
to
hop
characters
to
beer
drinkers
who
may
not
be
used
to
it
o
this
is
like
a
very
tame
version
of
celebration
in
terms
of
the
malthops
balance
and
hops
used
drinkable
but
not
particularly
interesting
o
a
well
made
apa
not
necessarily
simple
but
not
overly
complex
either
just
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
easy
drinking
accessible
and
reasonably
priced
this
one
would
make
a
great
everyday
drinker
if
it
werent
a
limited
release
i
guess
im
not
too
crazy
about
this
one
but
i
appreciate
them
staying
true
to
the
style
not
bad
o
a
good
pale
ale
i
like
the
flavors
but
a
few
tweeks
here
and
there
would
make
it
even
better
goose
island
is
a
macro
brewery
that
is
as
good
at
faking
it
as
my
women
whenever
i
purchase
a
goose
island
product
i
feel
like
i
am
really
indulging
in
a
craft
brew
yet
they
technically
are
a
macro
brewery
in
lieu
of
ownership
nonetheless
this
beer
like
most
goose
island
products
really
pulls
it
off
the
appearance
is
a
dark
orange
that
leaves
decent
lacing
and
the
aroma
is
malty
and
bitter
just
like
the
taste
it
tastes
like
a
standard
i
p
a
stone
alaskan
ect
with
extra
malt
and
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
electric
and
yet
it
finishes
smooth
this
beer
is
not
up
to
par
with
honkers
or
sofie
but
if
you
are
craving
a
pale
ale
with
some
pronounced
bitterness
this
is
a
great
choice
as
the
price
is
definitely
fair
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
slight
nail
polish
remover
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
slight
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
odd
nail
polish
remover
aroma
that
thankfully
doesnt
come
across
in
the
taste
easy
drinking
ipa
i
would
have
again
ive
had
this
both
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
in
the
last
week
i
had
hoped
it
was
bad
draught
but
the
bottle
confirmed
that
this
beer
blows
it
is
so
bad
id
actually
like
my
money
back
i
have
5
more
in
my
fridge
if
anyone
wants
them
the
appearance
is
super
dark
for
a
pale
honestly
its
dark
even
for
a
stiff
ipa
the
taste
is
nothing
like
id
expect
pale
ale
is
a
real
stretch
in
name
this
is
a
poorly
flavored
ipa
no
fruit
pine
kind
of
spicy
but
overall
just
pretty
shitty
overall
disappointing
overall
by
no
means
a
standout
but
its
wellbalanced
and
pleasant
enough
for
what
it
is
o
not
too
bad
easy
to
drink
refreshing
paleipa
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
but
ie
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
not
a
bad
beer
some
great
fragrance
and
flavor
doesnt
seem
completely
balanced
but
its
worth
trying
overall
it
looks
and
smells
fantastic
but
that
only
gets
you
so
far
taste
is
what
brings
you
back
and
ten
hills
there
is
little
flavor
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
but
not
a
case
overall
decent
pale
ale
ive
had
better
goose
island
still
does
well
cheers
on
the
label
the
hops
are
noted
as
from
elk
mountain
farms
and
they
are
fairly
subtle
but
very
very
nice
the
bottle
also
says
limited
edition
so
it
may
be
hard
to
find
more
easy
to
drink
a
nice
straight
forward
apa
that
i
would
consider
buying
again
loved
the
way
this
started
but
flavors
toned
down
as
it
warmed
overall
this
is
a
great
cheap
smooth
balanced
pale
ale
not
one
for
people
who
want
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
but
more
for
those
who
want
more
balance
reminds
me
of
the
standard
brew
at
your
corner
pub
very
drinkable
beer
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
and
the
malt
is
restrained
enough
to
let
the
delicate
floral
hops
show
through
overall
another
solid
pale
ale
to
enter
the
american
market
solid
enough
but
probably
not
really
needed
o
a
good
apa
with
great
balance
and
good
drinkability
the
hopmalt
combo
works
very
well
and
helps
out
with
the
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
supporting
the
big
boys
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
an
apa
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
orange
fruit
and
biscuit
malt
body
is
medium
and
tangy
taste
is
of
citrusy
and
herbal
hops
biscuit
malt
and
ripe
fruit
finish
is
long
grapefruity
nice
easy
drinking
apa
very
malt
forward
with
a
surprisingly
full
body
generally
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
pale
ale
overall
pretty
good
and
easy
to
enjoy
has
a
sweet
citric
flavor
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
something
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
the
wheat
is
masked
under
all
the
fruits
and
sugars
throwing
the
balance
off
some
still
worth
a
drink
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
long
o
a
fine
american
pale
ale
with
an
exceptionally
well
balanced
malthop
profile
hops
make
themselves
known
but
are
not
gratingly
bitter
by
any
means
a
worthwhile
addition
to
the
goose
island
lineup
the
taste
is
very
good
lots
of
citrus
from
the
hops
with
a
mild
caramel
malt
flavor
which
adds
dimension
to
the
pinelike
hops
and
some
mild
alcohol
in
the
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
as
it
is
a
solid
stronger
pale
ale
not
quite
an
ipa
hop
wise
but
pretty
nice
balance
bottled
on
date
nov

2013
pours
a
deep
copper
amber
hue
with
a
big
khaki
light
tan
head
forms
fine
intricate
lacing
with
more
than
ample
head
retention
going
on
aroma
has
citrus
notes
with
a
hint
of
sourdough
bread
dig
deeper
and
i
get
some
earthy
pine
hop
notes
as
well
flavors
hit
middle
of
the
road
mainly
muddled
malts
with
an
earthy
pine
slightly
citric
hop
accent
not
quite
an
orchestra
of
hops
like
i
was
hoping
more
of
another
muddled
hard
to
pick
out
hop
character
by
the
way
this
batch
was
brewed
in
baldwinsville
ny
versus
in
chicago
at
least
the
labels
are
honest
ive
found
oktoberfests
and
harvests
brewed
and
bottled
at
both
locations
its
a
hoppy
beer
yet
its
hard
to
distinguish
the
cohesiveness
of
these
darker
caramel
malts
and
these
hops
from
elk
mountain
farms
definitely
solid
and
sessionable
and
will
be
shared
at
the
party
we
are
hosting
tomorrow
night
however
i
want
more
expressive
hops
in
my
pale
ales
especially
when
the
label
is
as
green
and
littered
with
as
many
hops
as
this
label
expresses
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
resinous
feel
with
ample
carbonation
yet
something
is
off
im
having
a
hard
time
expressing
what
it
is
i
dont
care
for
but
its
lacking
something
the
ten
hills
ipa
from
the
goose
is
decent
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
14
finger
thick
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
scent
to
me
is
floral
in
nature
almost
smell
bubblegum
the
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
and
is
more
of
a
pot
purri
flare
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
beer
nice
little
surprise
right
here
this
is
a
very
good
apa
interesting
hop
profile
similar
to
this
years
hop
trip
from
deschutes
but
not
quite
as
pungent
overall
this
brew
pushes
the
limits
of
an
apa
with
its
dark
color
and
dominating
hop
profile
i
think
this
brew
was
released
at
a
good
time
just
before
winter
with
cold
temperatures
i
want
my
brews
to
be
darker
and
more
flavorful
its
pleasant
to
drink
and
does
an
excellent
job
of
featuring
the
hops
my
only
critique
is
that
i
would
like
some
more
malt
flavor
to
balance
the
hops
poured
into
gi
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
nice
filtered
deep
gold
with
white
head
that
retains
nicely
and
leaves
dense
lacing
the
nose
has
some
earthy
hop
character
with
some
firm
pine
and
not
much
else
i
must
say
it
is
not
my
favorite
hop
profile
but
there
is
definitely
significant
hops
in
the
aroma
the
pine
comes
on
fairly
strong
on
the
flavor
and
has
a
strong
bitterness
by
midpalate
the
finish
leaves
some
malty
notes
with
caramel
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
light
body
overall
not
a
bad
12
pack
brew
from
gi
but
definitely
prefer
harvest
ale
or
honkers
to
this
goose
island
ten
hills
pale
ale
45
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
with
a
great
feel
nice
smooth
taste
profile
and
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
feel
i
would
like
to
see
this
made
an
average
release
instead
of
a
limited
rather
tasty
o
enjoyable
but
not
really
anything
special
interesting
combination
of
hops
with
the
herbal
notes
very
present
i
liked
it
but
im
not
sure
that
i
would
grab
it
again
as
there
are
many
others
more
interestingenjoyable
to
me
in
the
style
notes
very
nice
well
made
apa
with
its
own
contribution
to
the
style
i
like
it
o
a
nice
pale
ale
addition
to
the
shelves
maybe
more
to
my
liking
because
its
a
limited
release
and
shouldnt
turn
into
just
another
pale
ale
more
herbal
than
fruity
as
pales
go
but
very
satisfying
for
a
hop
hit
othe
balance
is
the
best
part
great
hops
taste
that
goes
to
a
dry
malt
finish
and
nothing
about
it
overpowering
dull
plain
and
virtually
tasteless
not
worth
my
time
to
write
a
full
review
very
nice
beer
the
heart
of
chicago
refreshing
and
a
no
bitter
aftertaste
nice
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
foam
that
dissipates
into
very
strong
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
tropical
fruits
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
strong
with
pine
and
biscuity
malts
very
strong
up
front
especially
for
such
a
low
abv
but
finishes
relatively
clean
and
crisp
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
high
carbonation
overall
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
judging
from
its
76
ba
score
well
worth
picking
up
enjoyable
gobbledygook
we
are
from
the
city
that
invented
the
skyscraper
we
constructed
our
urban
pale
ale
on
a
balanced
malt
backbone
so
the
citrus
hop
aroma
and
crisp
flavor
can
stand
tall
great
beer
has
everything
an
ipa
should
have
rjt
o
really
better
than
i
was
expectingl
a
good
session

4
0
crap
bland
as
they
come
dont
bother
there
are
far
better
pale
ales
out
there
this
is
below
average
i
usually
dont
like
ipas
since
they
are
too
hoppy
so
i
actually
liked
this
one
since
it
wasnt
as
strong
as
other
ipas
ive
tasted
o
middle
of
the
road
seems
to
be
an
attempt
at
gateway
beer
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
to
get
them
to
the
better
stuff
the
bottle
pops
with
an
assertive
burst
but
no
gushing
beer
pours
in
to
an
ipa
tulip
with
2
fingers
of
loose
white
foam
that
crackles
and
fizzes
away
without
wasting
any
time
a
little
picturesque
lacing
and
patches
of
foam
around
the
edges
are
all
that
remain
the
goldenorange
appearance
of
the
beer
shows
a
tremendous
degree
of
clarity
displaying
scores
of
tiny
bubbles
that
ascend
with
a
sense
of
urgency
a
mild
aroma
of
caramel
malts
biscuits
and
sweet
fruity
esters
paves
the
way
for
a
touch
of
sour
citrus
scent
tastes
of
toasted
grain
a
bit
of
sugar
and
some
slightly
dry
fruity
hops
compose
the
flavor
profile
theres
a
nice
biscuitlike
backbone
and
an
oddlyinteresting
lemon
candy
aftertaste
that
sticks
to
your
palate
the
slick
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
with
tame
carbonation
a
bit
surprising
given
the
audible
pop
that
announced
the
open
bottle
overall
this
doesnt
quite
come
together
in
a
cohesive
way
it
has
a
decently
complex
flavor
profile
but
the
lack
of
body
and
unbalanced
attributes
holds
this
one
back
worthy
of
a
sample
and
not
a
bad
effort
by
any
means
but
give
me
the
sierra
nevada
thats
right
next
to
it
in
the
beer
cooler
if
were
looking
for
a
pale
ale
chi
city
great
beer
awesome
the
aftertaste
is
more
hoppy
than
i
would
like
its
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
pale
clear
golden
small
white
head
this
is
a
drinkable
but
pedestrian
pale
ale
balanced
pale
malt
and
american
hops
medium
in
body
and
moderately
bitter
finish
this
is
a
good
brew
but
not
exceptional
solid
but
decent
at
best
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
definitely
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
feel
very
good
carbonation
but
overly
thin
body
o
something
about
this
that
i
dont
like
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
very
decent
pale
ale
nice
mild
hoppyness
and
citrusy
taste
you
can
usually
find
it
for
less
than
a
buck
a
bottle
also
better
than
a
stick
in
the
eye
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
unique
beers
are
listed
for
goose
island
so
of
course
all
of
them
cant
be
back
yard
rye
bourbon
county
or
madame
rose
right
well
this
one
feels
a
bit
corporate
like
a
reach
to
the
perimeters
of
craft
beer
rather
than
a
beer
for
those
at
the
center
i
appreciate
bringing
new
people
on
board
but
they
already
have
beer
for
that
this
is
a
dumbed
down
american
pale
pretty
tasty
actually
in
its
hop
profile
and
very
fresh
but
there
just
isnt
enough
of
it
its
like
the
flavor
is
great
but
the
part
that
makes
it
great
is
reduced
or
suppressed
or
just
a
flash
rather
than
a
presence
grassy
and
floral
and
summery
are
the
hops
very
mild
bitterness
and
an
irrelevant
grain
base
thats
clean
and
simple
without
much
structure
i
know
the
purpose
of
this
beer
and
i
can
appreciate
that
but
i
know
they
are
capable
of
making
better
beer
so
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
totally
pleasant
and
definitely
a
league
better
than
other
beers
that
will
share
its
contexts
overall
eh
its
okay
its
not
going
to
blow
anyones
socks
off
and
i
dont
think
thats
the
intent
its
a
fair
flavored
easy
drinking
beer
decent
barbeque
option
though
personally
id
pass
for
something
better
not
much
else
to
say
you
tolerate
it
because
it
is
one
of
the
better
options
at
wrigley
field
o
certainly
not
goose
islands
best
effort
an
uneven
beer
with
a
badly
thought
out
flavor
um
was
this
beer
filtered
through
barbed
wire
because
it
definitely
has
some
metallic
stuff
going
on
along
with
that
is
not
the
most
savory
of
hop
flavors
and
i
guess
some
malt
just
for
the
hell
of
it
as
it
warmed
up
or
maybes
rauls
dome
did
cuz
this
was
his
third
beer
it
mellowed
a
bit
but
no
amount
of
bubble
kush
could
chill
this
bad
boy
out
taste
is
bitter
lemon
fruit
peels
grass
hint
of
bitterness
with
light
grain
bread
crust
sweetness
balancing
bitter
well
but
with
bitterness
just
dominating
and
leaving
it
a
bit
dryish
hint
of
metal
not
a
bad
beer
i
realize
apas
no
longer
set
the
world
on
fire
but
beers
like
this
are
always
welcome
in
my
fridge
solid
pale
ale
not
too
hoppy
but
not
too
relaxed
much
appreciated
on
a
day
like
today
definitely
not
a
beer
for
every
day
or
everyone
but
very
awesome
in
its
own
way
overall
not
a
bad
beer
glad
i
tried
it
out
had
it
on
tap
at
the
local
bowling
alley
didnt
like
it
very
much
kind
of
boring
and
what
little
taste
there
was
wasnt
good
would
rather
drink
the
312
wheat
beer
tap
pours
clear
amber
with
offwhite
head
aroma
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
tastes
of
pine
hops
citrus
and
caramel
light
body
and
low
carbonation
decent
cheap
beer
had
it
with
mexican
tonight
the
taste
didnt
hang
in
your
mouth
after
took
a
drink
like
some
ales
so
it
didnt
interfere
with
the
taste
of
the
food
pours
a
medium
copper
color
a
nice
head
of
buttery
foam
has
a
somewhat
fruity
aroma
taste
is
very
pleasant
balanced
with
a
citrus
note
that
is
not
overwhelming
a
very
drinkable
beer
tasty
smooth
tastenice
and
balanced
between
hop
and
malt
very
dry
floral
notes
overall
good
beer
nothing
to
exciting
going
on
with
the
tase
or
aromatics
but
i
think
with
a
american
its
all
about
balance
and
this
is
good
not
great
burp
boring
o
not
an
interesting
beer
at
all
goose
islands
quality
continues
to
dive
im
highly
suspicious
about
watereddown
pseudocraft
beer
vibe
in
this
product
im
boycotting
goose
island
from
now
on
notes
i
like
this
pale
ale
for
it
light
hop
balance
and
harmony
of
flavors
i
dont
expect
pale
ales
to
be
ipa
want
to
be
hop
bombs
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
312
urban
pale
ale
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
isnt
too
much
of
an
aroma
the
taste
is
sweeter
some
floral
notes
but
no
bitterness
a
fruity
aftertaste
flat
feel
and
weaker
flavors
overall
its
a
very
weak
beer
but
no
offensive
flavors
taste
starts
out
with
the
caramel
malt
very
slick
tasting
right
away
that
almost
has
an
oily
feeling
but
that
doesnt
last
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
nothing
that
really
speaks
to
citrus
or
pine
carbonation
is
in
the
medium
range
and
helps
lend
a
decent
body
smells
nice
pleasant
hop
aroma
then
things
go
downhill
from
there
taste
of
onion
and
garlic
with
a
bad
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
my
second
attempt
with
this
beer
i
want
it
to
be
good
but
its
not
disappointed
i
have
to
add
more
words
here
because
beer
advocate
requires
it
blah
blah
blah
it
sucked
major
honey
and
melon
notes
a
soso
pale
ale
the
rest
a
somewhat
weak
beer
here
nothing
stands
out
or
is
noteworthy
just
a
pretty
mediocre
pale
ale
good
solid
beer
no
faults
no
problems
light
body
medium
carbonation
seems
a
little
more
vigorous
than
it
actually
is
okay
feel
overall
we
were
happy
to
see
an
addition
to
the
312
series
here
they
take
it
obviously
away
from
the
pale
wheatiness
of
the
original
giving
more
hops
and
pale
ambers
and
toast
for
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
lover
to
bite
into
the
malts
however
seem
rushed
allowing
for
much
more
infiltration
of
the
hops
and
of
curious
inherent
tropical
fruitiness
to
take
hold
erasing
the
strict
balance
from
the
grain
bill
we
are
certainly
being
strict
in
our
dissection
but
figured
that
the
lack
of
balance
was
the
most
notable
detriment
to
this
guy
the
flavor
tends
to
just
peter
out
without
much
to
bolster
or
keep
your
interest
we
hope
this
is
not
representative
of
what
is
to
come
from
the
new
goose
island
not
very
good
at
all
gotta
admit
i
like
this
one
its
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
with
all
the
attributes
of
a
good
balanced
pale
ale
malt
and
hops
are
blended
well
with
some
biscuit
bread
and
caramel
malt
mixed
nicely
with
some
crisp
bitter
hops
i
find
this
beer
refreshing
and
tasty
even
more
refreshing
in
that
its
not
caving
to
the
newfangled
trend
of
ridiculously
overhopping
everything
and
then
rating
it
really
high
because
its
chock
full
of
ridiculously
inappropriate
levels
of
hops
good
job
goose
island
on
making
a
pale
ale
thats
a
friggin
pale
ale
and
not
an
ipa
i
am
really
digging
that
my
beer
was
born
on
my
49th
birthday
and
so
i
am
going
with
an
aggro
pour
to
celebrate
i
netted
two
fingers
of
rocky
tawny
head
with
persistent
retention
as
the
result
beautiful
lacing
began
to
appear
as
it
fell
so
i
leaned
in
for
a
sniff
the
pine
and
grapefruitcitrus
nose
was
as
prevalent
as
any
aipa
and
my
mouth
was
watering
in
anticipation
color
was
a
gorgeous
deepgold
srm

with
nequality
clarity
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
the
unholy
trio
of
midas
mammon
and
croesus
suddenly
appeared
to
beg
for
a
sip
but
i
was
having
none
of
it
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
the
hops
were
much
more
prevalent
than
the
label
had
led
me
to
expect
apa
if
they
say
so
but
this
was
really
drinking
like
an
aipa
which
was
okay
by
me
actually
maybe
it
speaks
to
how
we
urban
dwellers
roll
we
need
more
hops
than
they
can
handle
in
those
little
soft
cities
finish
was
dry
and
i
suppose
that
it
could
have
been
as
dry
and
puckering
as
alum
were
it
not
for
their
purported
malt
backbone
all
i
ask
is
that
they
consider
putting
this
beer
in
a
can
an
inoffensive
beer
and
might
find
friends
among
those
who
think
bud
light
is
a
quality
beer
everyone
else
however
will
be
disappointed
in
this
one
its
light
and
refreshing
but
lacks
character
could
easily
be
a
sessionable
beer
but
there
are
plenty
available
that
offer
more
flavor

at

nothing

the
pale

are
noticeable
at

but
there
is
a
more
abrupt
citrus

character
with
the
flavors
of
cantaloupe
and
pineapple
ends
smooth
easy
drinking
for
a
bland
interpretation
of
the
style
its
drinkable
i
didnt
appreciate
the
soap
touch
which
i
think
after
having
a
second
is
from
a
general
blandness
more
than
a
defect
maybe
anyway
it
is
drinkable
it
does
have
some
balance
to
it
it
starts
off
sweetish
lands
bitterish
but
doesnt
really
come
together
okay
ive
gone
back
and
forth
on
the
overall
long
enough
to
say
it
hits
3
5
overall
but
im
really
trying
to
be
supportive
and
this
beer
is
making
me
work
at
it
ill
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
oa
boring
not
good
beer
expected
more
from
gi
this
beer
is
a
definite
pass
golden
color
with
good
clarity
weak
head
with
no
retention
and
minimal
lacing
clean
aims
just
mild
bread
gains
and
citric
hop
flavor
follows
the
nose
nothing
special
finishes
with
a
somewhat
harsh
soil
like
edge
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
and
somewhat
crisp
overall
mediocre
this
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
bitter
but
nothing
too
wild
the
taste
is
smooth
light
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
pretty
good
tasting
that
is
wellbalanced
and
leaves
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
not
the
best
pale
ale
in
the
world
but
it
sure
is
easy
drinking
overall
a
subdued
but
decent
light
brew
kind
of
more
like
a
english
bitter
than
apa
i
know
the
regular
gi
ipa
is
better
than
this
and
ill
bet
they
have
one
or
two
other
good
ones
but
these
312s
dont
give
them
any
cred
at
all
it
figures
that
ab
would
buy
them
mouthfeel
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
has
good
flavor
but
can
be
a
great
session
beer
i
think
an
ok
pale
ale
but
nothing
i
would
need
to
have
again
overall
boring
but
a
great
session
beer
to
watch
playoff
hockey
at
a
bar
i
had
4
of
them
and
felt
fine
as
the
abv
was
low
and
well
hidden
it
is
what
it
is
and
could
be
a
good
starter
craft
beer
for
the
masses
overall
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
underrated
this
is
a
solid
truetostyle
apa
that
is
meant
to
be
a
simple
flavorful
ale
without
blowing
your
tastebuds
out
in
one
way
or
another
comparable
to
snpa
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
detracts
too
much
to
really
make
the
beers
absolutely
comparable
to
each
other
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
cookouts
and
parties
if
you
cant
get
a
hold
of
snpa
and
you
want
a
relatively
inexpensive
easydrinking
pale
ale
the
copper
ale
is
a
tried
and
true
americanstyle
pale
ale
thats
not
afraid
to
tilt
slightly
in
the
favor
of
hops
rather
than
malt
but
thats
what
americans
do
to
craft
beer
and
thats
what
makes
this
ale
uniquely
of
the
midwest
but
commonly
of
domestic
pale
ale
o
a
wellbalanced
pale
ale
with
great
drinkability
the
nose
is
pretty
average
but
the
hops
do
stand
out
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
definitely
a
bit
more
robust
than
the
endless
ipa
worth
giving
a
go
o
average
beer
i
wont
get
another
though
it
is
a
very
good
beer
just
does
not
stand
out
upon
moving
to
chicago
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
was
recommended
to
try
everyone
i
talked
to
seemed
to
love
it
my
initial
reaction
was
that
it
didnt
have
much
taste
it
has
a
very
earthy
taste
to
it
that
of
wheat
and
hops
it
did
go
down
very
smoothly
but
overall
i
thought
it
was
just
okay
overall
not
real
complex
although
i
thought
the
aroma
was
going
to
be
a
good
start
pretty
boring
otherwise
not
my
favorite
pale
ale

overall

overall
a

some
will
find

boring
and
underwhelming
others
will
appreciate
the
approachability
some
pub
grub
and
a
pint
of
this
to
wash
it
down
is
a
match
made
in
heaven
a
definite
crossover
pale
ale
picked
up
this
one
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
to
try
as
i
have
really
liked
some
of
the
goose
island
stuff
so
here
we
go
pretty
good
looking
beer
but
a
little
pretty
for
my
taste
nice
smell
but
not
real
strong
not
bad
not
just
a
plain
pale
ale
with
good
not
great
flavor
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
i
will
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
o
meh
i
will
not
try
this
again
unless
im
handed
one
on
a
golf
course
bottle
picked
up
locally
and
enjoyed
from
a
goose
island
tulip
bottled
late
february
poured
a
transparent
orange
with
a
generous
frothy
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
an
earthy
malt
with
a
bit
of
grain
taste
to
match
no
questioning
if
this
could
be
an
ipa
this
is
a
pale
made
for
the
fan
of
the
malt
but
it
is
a
bit
grainy
too
decent
cross
over
brew
for
the
macro
fan
into
the
possibility
if
having
flavor
in
your
beer
probably
not
something
i
would
revisit
decent
session
brew
if
there
arent
other
options
malt
forward
with
a
hempy
hop
finish
this
beer
was
bland
and
unmemorable
the
best
that
i
can
say
for
it
was
that
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
didnt
have
any
offensive
or
overpowering
tastessmellsmouthfeel
which
i
find
to
be
the
case
with
most
macros
but
absolutely
nothing
about
it
stood
out
would
only
order
again
if
there
was
nothing
better
available
overall
this
is
pretty
much
like
its
yellow
312
counterpart
simple
decent
but
nothing
special
if
youre
looking
for
an
everyday
drinking
pale
ale
that
doesnt
pack
the
hop
punch
of
a
snpa
then
this
might
be
your
choice
o
you
wouldnt
guess
it
from
the
price
tag
or
the
quantity
of
it
in
stores
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
completely
unique
in
my
experience
combinations
of
flavors
and
even
if
there
is
no
subtlety
in
them
they
still
provide
more
than
enough
depth
whats
more
this
is
the
every
mans
beer
straight
from
the
bottle
you
will
still
get
all
of
the
nose
and
flavors
only
sacrificing
that
somewhat
confounding
but
amusing
syrupylooking
appearance
loved
it
at
first
sip
and
im
hoping
this
will
be
available
fresh
throughout
the
summer
urban
pale
ale
is
aromatic
and
flavorful
enough
to
drink
the
citrus
is
not
nearly
large
enough
to
support
the
very
malty
base
it
is
always
refreshing
to
get
a
beer
with
more
than
just
citrus
hops
happening
just
make
them
be
there
if
the
beer
is
supposed
to
have
them
pretty
nice
basic
pale
ale
its
got
that
familiar
goose
island
taste
malty
and
a
bit
dry
very
smooth
and
light
bodied
some
vegetable
crispness
a
mild
honey
dark
fruit

taste
it
has
a
bronze
color
fairly
clear
with
some
streams
of
bubbles
here
and
there
a
good
foamy
white
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
spiderweb
lacing
a
bit
of
a
white
wine
scent
to
it
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the
beer

streaks

there

on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
below
average
beer
with
subdued
aromas
and
a
metallic
flavor
that
isnt
all
that
pleasant
goose

312
urban
pale
ale
35
usually
i
quite
like
goose
islands
beers
so
upon
seeing
this
for
the
first
time
i
thought
id
give
it
a
whirl
its
drinkable
but
for
most
pale
ale
fans
like
myself
im
guessing
it
tastes
pretty
darn
bland
its
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
rather
thin
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
and
so
the
overall
impression
i
get
is
that
its
safe
i
e
for
those
who
dont
particularly
want
to
drink
a
pale
ale
in
the
first
place
and
dont
really
realize
what
they
might
be
missing
sorry
gi
its
fine
but
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
from
now
on
o
different
but
its
not
that
good
one
and
done
for
me
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
not
sure
where
they
were
going
with
this
gimick
but
it
wasnt
worth
the
effort
it
seems
to
be
more
of
an
inbevab
push
rather
than
a
more
crafty
goose
island
idea
to
me
pale
copper
hue
crystal
clear
completely
filtered
with
a
nice
off
white
head
forming
thick
leaves
behind
some
speckled
scattered
lacing
the
bottle
says
to
serve
it
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
check
aromatics
generic
hops
a
bit
of
citric
quality
maybe
some
floral
notes
but
just
dumbed
down
and
doesnt
really
jump
out
at
my
senses
flavor
clean
pale
malts
just
hints
of
labile
bitterness
from
a
tame
hop
profile
even
the
malt
profile
is
dead
on
arrival
all
carbonation
not
real
malt
breadiness
just
a
semi
sweet
crackerbiscuit
quality
residual
hop
bitterness
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
flavors
if
i
had
to
pick
some
descriptors
i
would
say
herbal
and
citrus
notes
very
dumbed
down
and
approachable
sold
at
a
speedway
gas
station
this
shouldnt
offend
any
of
the
masses
or
become
a
eureka
crossover
beer
for
too
many
mouthfeel
i
mentioned
the
unnatural
carbonation
please
send
us
some
goose
island
from
chicago
we
arent
that
far
in
ohio
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
just
a
bit
much
no
hop
oils
just
a
very
laid
back
rather
boring
stab
at
a
mainstay
pale
ale
overall
im
happy
to
have
a
rare
taste
of
bourbon
county
stout
or
barleywine
but
this
shouldnt
be
this
unassuming
o
not
one
i
would
pick
up
regularly
but
had
heard
it
was
inspired
by
green
line
pale
ale
so
i
needed
to
try
o
everything
in
this
beer
apart
from
the
aroma
natch
works
solidly
while
its
too
safe
to
be
a
great
pale
ale
it
thankfully
proves
that
i
can
still
enjoy
a
good
standard
pale
ale
from
time
to
time
as
far
as
middleoftheroad
daily
drinkers
go
this
is
quite
successful
i
thought
that
this
was
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
it
the
smell
was
full
of
the
wheat
that
is
in
the
original
312
but
with
a
little
bit
of
added
grapefruit
the
taste
delivered
more
of
the
same
it
was
about
what
i
expected
but
wasnt
boring
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
for
the
spring
and
was
happy
with
it
my
only
criticism
is
that
it
is
a
bit
of
a
dull
beer
but
i
thought
that
during
a
nice
spring
day
watching
the
snow
melt
there
are
worse
things
urban
pale
ale
is
brewed
with
amarillo
mt
hood
and
nugget
hops
giving
it
a
bright
crisp
pine
and
citrus
aroma
caramel
malt
gives
a
slightly
sweet
body
that
mingles
with
pine
and
grapefruit
hop
notes
in
the
taste
giving
it
good
overall
balance
and
high
drinkability
o
i
jokingly
told
someone
this
had
damnwell
better
taste
like
snpa
and
while
it
doesnt
exactly
its
definitely
on
that
same
plane
far
more
full
of
character
than
its
older
312
brother
and
proving
a
good
pale
ale
can

arent
loving

it

so
many

that
ive
had
over

off

i
am
surprised
and
disappointed
i
expected
the
best
from
founders
biscuit
goes
down
very
easily
but
the
dryness
was
too
much
and
took
away
from
the
taste
overall
the
flavors
seemed
a
bit
subdued
plus
the
slight
sourness
turned
me
off
a
bit
id
consider
this
to
be
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
apa
soneastjan

couldnt
ask
for
more
overall
this
is
a
tasty
i
probably
would
have
liked
this
beer
more
i
could
possibly
see
this
as
a
session
pale
ale
not
for
me
though
too
much
grapefruit
and
not
enough
of
anything
else
since
its
brewed
by
founders
it
turns
into
a
nice
light
lager
with
some
sweet
flavoring
not
what
founders
is
intending
for
but
turns
to
be
a
decent
tasting

the

could

been
more
hoppy

a

with

fizzed

did

the
smell
was
very
faint

only
some
hops

scents
the
taste
was
nice
with

grapefruit
and
some

it

nothing

a

good
for
those
that
dont

hopped
beer
was

not
usually
a

fan
but
this
was
fine
was
hoppy
but
not

but
nothing
thrilling
here
retains
an
aroma
consisting
of
resin
pine
grapefruit
and
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
flavor
reveals
deeply
toasted
malt
and
caramel
nutty
tones
at
the
base
with
a
moderately
bitter
finish
notes
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
add
complexity
hop
dominant
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
enough
malt
character
to
attract
the
nonhoppy
crowd

heavy

this
was
way
too
hoppy
for
me
though
admittedly
im
not
a
fan
of
really
hoppy
beers
those
that
enjoy
the
style
rave
about
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
for
me
overall
a
quite
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
nothing
crazy
out
of
the
ordinary
but
rather
tasty
none
the
less
ok
nothing
special
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
a
hoppy
beer
that
isnt
very
bitter
its
quite
nice
i
give
it
two
approving
thumbs
up
and
10
dollars
to
anyone
willing
to
get
me
some
o
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
this
beer
it
is
a
decent
pale
ale
it
is
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
it
does
not
stand
out
as
some
others
do
i
would
almost
call
it
am
amber
ale
based
on
appearance
o
a
solid
pale
ale
probably
not
as
wellflavored
as
when
fresh
but
still
very
drinkable

pleasant

not

i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
prefers
an
ipa
over
a
lager
o
nothing
mind
blowing
but
it
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops

backbone
the
aroma
seemed
to
be
faded

the

has
some
interesting

to
keep
it
from
being
onedimensional
o
flavor
is
perhaps
disappointing
after

its
still
a
great
beer
definitely
worth
a

drink
it
again

lovers
beer
normally
im
not
a

fan

overly
hoppy

unique

i
would
try
it
again
if
i
had

i
poured
this

poured

a
great
head
i
could
stack
it
2
inches
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
very
thick
and
creamy
the
beer
was
a
nice
amber
color
and
had
a
light
hop
smell
the
taste
was
nice
and
balanced
not
too
hoppy
nice
caramel
hit
very
pleasing
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
was
led
to
believe
a
whole
lot
more
about
the
greatness
of
this
offering
than
actually
came
to
pass
once
i
encountered
it
there
is
nothing
crisp
nor
overly
hoppy
about
it
blandness
is
the
best
word
i
have
to
proffer
which
makes
me
sad
by
the
same
token
the
marketing
and
my
introduction
to
it
perhaps
built
it
up
a
bit
too
much

a
very
good
beer

but
what
the

seemed
to
try
and
do
with
this
beer
was
make
a
sessionable
apa
with
a
big

profile

enough
to
satisfy

the

wish

were

all
in

a

an
impressive

like
to
drink
more

dark

pour
with
a
hazy
body
and
thick
medium
beige

smell
is
sweet
and
hoppymalt
balance
at
first
like
a
rich
amber
but
turns
metallic
after
a
bit
this
bottle
must
be
a
little
old
needs
a
touch
more
malt
in
the
taste
and
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
slight
metal
and
oxidation
in
the
taste
and
it
almost
turns
sour
as
it
sits
unbalanced
and
most
likey
unfresh
poured
a
deep
orange
almost
brown
and
very
cloudy
the
citrus
smell
was
very
noticeable
with
mostly
grapefruit
and
orange
coming
through
as
the
label
states
hazed
and
infused
with
hops
which
held
true
highly
drinkable
and
the
hops
were
the
main
characteristic
they
were
not
overwhelming
nice
enjoyable
beer
d
if
it
were
not
for
the
increased
bitterness
i
might
be
fooled
into
thinking
this
is
an
american
amber
ale
or
something
similar
so
while
this
is
a
decent
tasting
beer
it
does
not
seem
to
fit
withing
the
style
as
well
as
i
would
hope
for
an
apa
d
a
fairly
easy
drinker
with
a
distinct
dry
hopped
aroma
and
flavor
hops
possess
a
slight
burnt
quality
in
the
finish
but
overall
i
find
this
brew
to
be
a
tasty
one
overall
its
extremely
drinkable
in
part
because
the
flavor
is
not
all
that
strong
it
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
summer
evening
this
is
what
i
would
expect
if
koolaid
brought
out
a
beer
flavored
drink
mix
dont
get
me
wrong
it
isnt
bad
or
hideous
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
special
to
it
imho
ymmv
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
much
more
sessionable
than
your
average
ipa
or
dipa
while
still
satisfying
my
hop
fix
overall
one
of
my
go
tos
at
a
local
hangout
one
of
their
best
beers
on
the
menu
that
is
good
tasting
and
quite
sessionable
one
of
boulder
beer
companys
best
enjoyed
this
courtesy
of
barefootbrewer
pours
a
hazy
orangeycoppery
color
with
a
fantastic
thick
head
that
lasts
forever
aroma
is
very
hoppy
and
dominates
the
smell
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
the
hops
with
little
if
any
maltiness
coming
through
not
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
but
not
bad
for
the
hop
addict
lacing
was
pretty
good
as
was
mouthfeel
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
pours
a
nice
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
foamy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
has
a
hoppy
overtone
with
citrus
in
the
background
the
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
bitter
finish
but
not
over
the
top
at
all
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
it
has
a
nice
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
apa
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
selection
dont
get
hung
up
on
the
style
delicious
beer
without
the
extra
abv
definitely
a
great
session
selection
pours
with
a
mediumthin
head
pale
yellow
over
an
amber
body
hoppy
as
the
bottle
suggests
and
fairly
pleasant
my
main
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
too
sweet
and
the
sweetness
detracts
from
the
hop
flavor
the
smell
is
great
and
the
beer
remains
drinkable
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
d
very
drinkable
surpassed
expectations
very
good
session
beer
despite
my
smooth
librarian
aesthetic
i
wanted
to
loathe
this
beer
due
to
its
eyeball
murdering
label
ignoring
my
offended
artistic
sensibilities
i
tried
this
one
the
other
day
at
the
mellow
mushroom
and
found
it
to
be
rather
appealing
the
smell
and
taste
are
quite
grassy
and
actually
it
tasted
like
an
ipa
to
me
if
you
like
that
distinctive
hop
taste
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
although
it
doesnt
have
that
bitter
punch
to
it
that
i
enjoy
not
my
favorite
but
much
better
than
the
hippy
cheesey
label
suggests
md
carbonation
is
just
right
a
medium
to
light
body
drinkability
is
good
as
this
one
is
easy
to
go
down
and
low

nose

with

and

a
superb
apa
with
a
fairly
decent
hop
kick
to
it
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
not
very
high
alcohol
so
it
is
a
good
drinker
would
definitely
order
this
again
in
summation
i
would
definitely
reach
for
this
beer
again
if
i
saw
it
out
somewhere
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
a
nice
hoppy
ale
might
give
this
one
another
try
to
ensure
i
didnt
have
a
bad

something
didnt

nothing

just

mouthfeel
was
a

thin

still
pleasant
all
in

a

and
i
would

have

copped
a

from

for

first
sip
not
overly
impressed
its
got
some
bitterness
up
front
due
to
the
hops

the
finish
is
somewhat
lackluster
hints
of
spicy
citrusy
hops
come
through
as
it
warms
as
well
as
a
pale
malty
note
above
average
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
amazing
the
mediumthin
body
is
nicely
carbonated
bitter
at
times
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
and
refreshing
bite
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
sure
its
not
the
most
inyourface
flavor
rush
that
some
of
us
seek
but
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
and
price
for
that
matter
it
holds
its
own

i
was
surprised
that
there
wasnt
much
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
dry
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
boulder
d
the
hops
aroma
and
flavor
are
showcased
here
and
the
bitterness
is
tamed

it

does
a
good
job
of
balancing
with
the
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
worth
trying
overall
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
if
you
are
lloking
for
something
citrusy
worth
a
try
but
not
great
d
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
it
just
wasnt
very
good
i
tossed
it
after
about
13
if
it
comes
around
again
i
might
try
it
just
to
see
if
this
was
a
fluke
d
it
is
okay
except
a
little
bit
too
strong
of
an
ipa
for
my
tastes
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
im
getting
another
one
nuff
said
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
great
a
decent
beer
that
hangs
its
hat
on
hops
but
not
very
complex
in
any
other
aspect
12oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
gold
with
reasonable
head
that
looks
like
it
wants
to
stick
around
aroma
of
fantastic
fresh
floral
hops
even
though
this
particular
bottle
was
purchased
a
few
months
ago
flavour
has
nice
bitterness
with
good
flavouring
hops
although
i
think
the
beer
was
in
better
form
when
younger
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
filled
the
growler
at
local
beverage
distributor
tasted
in
frozen
pint
glass
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
head
a
really
nice
citrusy
hoppy
scent
nicely
carbonated
on
the
tongue
that
give
a
tingle
to
the
mouth
good
hoppy
taste
that
finishes
nicely
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
apas
ive
had
very
refreshing
and
a
nice
change
from
the
ordinary
pretty
good
overall
but
the
mouthfeel
kills
it
for
me
i
would
still
drink
this
again
id
definitely
buy
this
again
as
i
have
several
times
already
i
had
to
slow
down
to
review
this
beer
i
was
drinking
it
too
fast
overall
nothing
over
the
top
here
just
a
well
balanced
finely
crafted
american
pale
ale
it
fits
well
to
the
style
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
indeed
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
that
i
have
run
across
looking
forward
to
another
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
ballofflax
head
on
it
that
fades
to
a
scummy
protective
coating
aroma
is
fantastic
sweet
grassy
and
extremely
hoppy
i
would
buy
deodorant
in
that
smell
flavor
is
also
strong
grassy
hoppiness
up
front
followed
by
a
big
malty
mouthfeel
which
gradually
tails
off
and
recedes
pretty
quickly
a
very
nice
beer
and
reminds
me
of
a
bit
of
a
pale
imitation
of
some
of
our
big
midwestern
ipas
like
fff
bells
dark
horse
founders
etc
but
still
recommended
its
not
bad
but
its
more
of
a
once
and
a
while
type
pours
golden
to
amber
in
color
basic
bitter
citrus
hop
aroma
same
for
the
taste
quite
hoppy
in
a
citrus
almost
funky
overripe
sort
of
way
the
moutfeel
is
kind
of
heavy
and
sticky
a
bit
too
much
so
for
the
style
of
brew
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
out
of
a
crowd
pretty
decent
lots
of
hops
but
not
much
else
very
drinkable
good
abv
for
session
has
some
flaws
but
its
my
go
to
beer
for
just
relaxing
edit
i
am
shocked
this
isnt
rated
higher
i
think
people
must
be
expecting
an
ipa
whcih
this
is
not
it
still
provides
me
with
my
hop
fix
without
being
a
one
trick
pony
drinkability
the
sour
finish
is
hard
to
get
over
i
would
like
to
give
this
another
try
but
one
that
i
know
how
old
the
beer
is
maybe
closer
to
the
brewery
hmmmm
must
take
a
trip
to
denver
sometime
t
solid
session
beer
but
for
hopheads
only
so
good
i
needed
to
stay
for
a
second
almost
missed
my
flight
figures
it
would
be
the
one
time
united
flew
on
time
di
think
this
is
quite
good
for
such
an
unbalanced
beer
if
this
were
balanced
it
certainly
would
be
a
6
ipa
becasue
so
much
more
malt
would
be
necessary
to
balance
it
out
and
if
you
cut
back
the
hops
to
balance
it
out
well
then
it
just
wouldnt
be
the
same
so
for
a
nice
long
session
when
im
looking
for
hops
this
will
be
the
one
final
note
you
cant
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
and
you
cant
judge
a
beer
by
its
look
and
aroma
d
a
very
potent
brew
in
flavor
definitely
a
must
try
for
hop
fans
very
flavorful
and
juiced
up
w
crystal
and
centennial
hops
it
is
intense
and
is
a
beer
that
tastes
a
lot
bigger
than
it
is
i
could
drink
several
without
any
problem
very
quaffable
enjoyed
out
of
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
very
pleasant
hazy
orangey
copper
with
a
creamywhite
two
finger
shortlived
head
lacing
left
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
immediately
of
strong
hops
floral
and
spicy
i
could
smell
the
hops
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
bottle
taste
is
a
little
lacking
i
thought
there
would
be
more
hop
flavor
instead
i
was
hit
with
too
much
bitterness
and
not
enough
flavor
citrus
and
grassy
notes
but
not
a
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
slick
with
a
noticeably
astringent
aftertaste
very
smooth
but
the
bitterness
is
going
to
limit
me
to
1
or
2
at
a
time
overall
i
think
this
beers
bark
smell
is
worse
more
deceiving
than
its
bite
taste
i
liked
it
and
i
think
its
worth
a
try
but
im
going
to
try
their
other
ipa
next
time
mojo
ipa
d
as
i
mentioned
above
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
higher
ibu
amount
compared
to
other
apas
that
ive
had
and
they
are
my
favorite
style
id
recommend
this
beer
but
the
higher
than
normal
ibu
content
will
probably
limit
you
from
drinking
to
many
of
these
in
a
row
id
say
i
actually
liked
this
more
at
first
drink
than
later
on
the
wateryness
shows
up
more
later
and
the
neat
fruit
flavors
disappear
into
a
sort
of
bland
bitterness
as
the
beer
goes
on
its
by
no
means
bad
just
not
mindblowing
nice
orange
color
with
a
soap
bubble
foamy
off
white
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
inviting
looking
beer
smell
is
that
clasic
grapefruit
hops
smell
very
clean
smooth
and
inviting
taste
has
a
nice
citrus
burst
in
it
also
a
solid
malty
backbone
mostly
caramel
with
some
bready
notes
also
medium
body
and
a
mild
piney
finish
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
it
leans
a
little
toward
ipa
range
which
is
fine
with
me
but
might
surprise
some
looking
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
style
of
beer
one
might
say
that
is
busts
in
your
mouth
like
a
juicy
grapefruit
a
decent
apa
i
was
excited
by
the
pour
nice
glowing
orange
color
medium
bodied
head
and
some
whiffs
of
hoppiness
flavor
was
good
enough
some
floral
hops
not
too
flavorful
and
a
hint
of
malts
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
but
not
so
satisfying
not
a
bad
choice
but
it
lacked
flavor
and
real
character
almost
as
if
a
good
brew
was
made
then
watered
down
for
mass
production
though
id
still
try
another
boulder
in
the
future
d
damn
near
perfect
for
this
style
though
not
so
complex
a
beer
its
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
tasty
and
aromatic
hops
low
abv
what
more
do
you
want
i
could
sniff
those
hops
all
night
long
and
probably
be
satisfied
overall
a
true
hop
bomb
delivers
what
it
advertises
but
could
use
a
bit
more
balance
by
using
less
bittering
hops
while
maintaining
the
hop
flavor
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
a
good
choice
for
summer
sessions
and
refreshment
certainly
approachable
as
well
thanks
again
mark
for
this
well
made
and
tasty
ale
which
would
go
down
nicely
at
a
family
or
work
bbq
or
picnic
ill
be
looking
for
this
at
my
favorite
beer
stores
and
probably
soon
ppours
a
clean
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
in
the
nose
a
earthiness
and
grapefruity
hops
in
the
taste
a
fruity
sweetness
and
a
small
bitterness
very
smooth
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
aroma
and
taste
is
well
its
just
off
i
taste
raisins
but
not
in
a
rich
fruity
way
and
the
citrus
hops
seem
almost
in
contrast
bitterness
is
mild
just
right
and
bodycarbonation
are
spot
on
crisp
just
a
tad
oily
but
thin
and
smooth
enough
to
go
down
like
a
champ
but
the
hops
are
a
little
vegetal
and
this
odd
grapy
raisiny
sweetness
keeps
sticking
around
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
apa
its
distinct
enough
that
i
could
see
either
coming
around
on
it
or
it
clicking
for
some
people
and
really
loving
it
so
im
not
not
recommending
it
but
it
sure
doesnt
do
it
for
me
one
was
enough
although
i
went
back
for
another
to
confirm
my
feelings
id
drink
it
and
im
curious
to
try
on
tap
or
perhaps
in
a
state
closer
to
the
source
im
in
ma
at
the
moment
hazed
infused
was
a
darker
amber
color
and
hazy
it
had
a
beige
head
that
had
good
retention
and
lacing
citrus
hops
dominate
the
aroma
the
taste
was
full
of
hops
as
well
with
some
caramel
malt
to
balance
it
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
excellent
it
was
a
very
nice
pale
ale
this
is
not
a
onesizefitsallbeer
but
is
brew
that
seems
directly
aimed
at
pale
ale
fans
starts
with
a
hazy
deep
amber
appearance
then
moves
to
intense
floral
aroma
to
the
floral
fruity
hoppy
taste
very
drinkable
enjoyable
and
recommended
to
all
pale
ale
fans
despite
the
below
average
abv
overall
a
highly
drinkable
apa
hoppy
and
malty
well
balanced
just
a
little
watery
toward
the
end
but
still
quite
tasty
taste
hoppy
and
light
with
hints
of
citrus
apricot
grapefruit
some
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
comes
through
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
extremely
drinkable
because
of
the
low
abv
but
very
tasty
good
session
beer
edit
i
should
really
wait
till
i
finish
a
beer
before
casting
final
judgment
with
the
end
of
the
pint
glass
coming
i
notice
a
mouthfeel
and
taste
taking
a
hit
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
a
faint
mineral
astringency
become
more
prominent
and
the
beer
suffers
overall
mouthfeel
and
taste
scores
suffer
accordingly
went
well
with
some
veggie
enchiladas
but
doesnt
stand
well
on
its
own
in
the
end
a
tad
under
medium
bodied
just
a
bit
watery
nothing
major
to
complain
about
here
this
is
one
fine
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
i
got
more
than
i
deserved
this
is
a
top
notch
apa
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
actually
i
think
i
will
d
is
medium
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
taste
after
the
promosing
smell
however
it
still
wasnt
a
bad
beer
overall
a
very
good
apa
enjoyable
and
drinkable
recommended
a
pleasant
surprise
worth
getting
again
for
sure
a
solid
though
not
amazing
beer
a
bit
stingy
and
astringent
in
the
mouth
with
a
bitter
bite
to
the
finish
drinkability
is
fine
for
a
little
something
different
and
mild
potency
this
is
very
quaffable
and
suits
a
hot
climate
where
the
limited
hop
flavor
can
be
refreshing
this
strictly
a
hot
weather
beer
and
should
not
be
seriously
considered
an
american
pale
ale
this
could
be
a
hell
of
a
pale
ale
if
theyd
fix
the
watery
finish
made
it
just
needs
more
bittering
hops
pours
a
nice
red
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
white
frothy
head
as
it
dissolves
a
nice
lacing
resides
smell
is
fruity
hops
with
some
maltiness
which
is
rare
in
most
ipas
ive
had
taste
is
a
fully
citrusy
and
some
slight
bitterness
and
maltiness
pretty
solid
beer
overall
and
readily
available
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
nice
representation
of
style
and
of
the
best
apas
that
ive
had
i
could
drink
a
lot
these
its
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
all
evening
long
clear
amber
orange
with
a
solid
one
inch
head
which
was
white
the
smell
is
hoppy
fruity
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
chewy
hoppy
and
balanced
with
some
malt
some
fruity
notes
in
the
taste
mostly
citrus
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
stuff
and
i
like
the
low
abv
i
may
have
to
start
buying
this
in
sixers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
presents
as
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
this
is
a
very
aromatic
beer
hints
of
citrus
and
floral
are
immediately
present
upon
closer
inspection
there
are
hints
of
pine
the
hops
are
very
nicely
presented
in
the
taste
there
is
a
pinefloral
flavor
up
front
which
leads
into
a
grapefruit
like
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
this
one
was
great
huge
floral
hop
nose
showed
no
mercy
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
an
off
white
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lace
crisp
clean
flavors
tons
of
citrusy
hops
big
flavors
were
orange
tangerince
and
pineapple
hint
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
oin
the
back
overall
this
was
fantastic
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
or
be
able
to
get
it
locally
as
this
was
just
great
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
interesting
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
bbc
beers
and
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
unfortunately
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
heres
hoping
the
rest
of
the
lineup
is
more
interesting
found
this
on
tap
as
part
of
the
rock
bottom
brewpubs
sampler
in
the
minneapolis
airport
id
had
it
in
bottles
in
new
york
but
it
was
far
superior
here
as
the
name
indicates

this

goes
down
easy

a
session
for
summer
winter
whenever
recommended
on
tap
d
keep
this
one
coming
a
great
session
beer
at
less
than
5
abv
and
an
incredibly
fresh
crisp
taste
makes
this
a
perfect
summer
afternoon
brew
and
its
relatively
complex
hoppy
character
gives
it
enough
of
a
wallop
to
stand
on
its
own
regardless
of
thirstquenching
abilities
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
is
a
large
thick
creamy
head
the
stays
with
this
brew
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
floraland
earhty
hops
the
smells
really
setup
and
highlight
this
beer
the
taste
is
that
same
good
fruit
hop
smell
along
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
slick
hop
resin
oils
coat
the
mouth
and
dont
leave
bringing
down
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
for
me
a
create
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
nice
sunny
spring
day
thats
okay
because
the
taste
is
nice
very
smooth
light
hoppy
and
malty
finish
crystal
hops
arent
the
most
floral
if
i
remember
correctly
and
the
resulting
brew
isnt
as
floral
as
i
expected
very
pleasent
but
not
at
all
earth
shattering
solidly
good
drinkability
a
very
quaffable
pale
ale
not
hoppy
in
a
bitter
or
tongue
smackin
way
but
lots
of
good
hop
flavors
and
balance
great
beer
to
drink
all
night
long
i
prefer
hoppy
ales
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
initial
taste
is
pleasing
but
there
is
a
lingering
aftertaste
and
dry
mouth
feel
that
i
find
a
bit
unpleasant
this
is
definately
a
less
is
more
beer
one
bottle
is
enough
to
satisfy
even
the
most
die
hard
hop
heads
md
smooth
for
so
many
ibus
easy
down
just
needs
bit
more
flavored
balance
decent
body
a
nice
and
decent
beer
this
is
a
decent
dryhopped
ale
but
nothing
too
special
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rustic
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
a
head
that
doesnt
stay
to
long
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
not
much
though
smell
is
amazing
you
can
litterly
smell
the
taste
of
this
fine
brew
candy
smell
with
citrus
hops
this
is
one
fine
smellling
beverage
taste
is
also
pretty
good
for
the
big
hop
smell
it
has
a
slight
taste
of
bitterness
somewhat
malty
with
a
citrus
flair
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
weaker
ipa
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
my
first
time
with
a
boulder
beer
i
believe
we
recently
got
them
down
here
in
florida
i
will
be
visiting
this
one
more
often

the

noticably

a

and
has
a
sharp

of
a
finish

not
unenjoyable
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
little
beer
average
drinkability
overall
i
just
wasnt
impressed
but
its
decent
enough
that
i
would
revisit
and
see
if
its
any
better
a
different
time
and
place
may
improve
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
decent
apa
but
nothing
outstanding
give
it
a
go
if
youre
a
hophead
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side

this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
with

drinkability
this
is
a
great
apa
that
could
outshine
many
dipas
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
bigger
beer
without
the
alcohol
presence
it
gets
down
to
business
with
full
flavor
my
only
qualm
is
that
i
prefer
grapefruit
flavors
over
pine
i
would
certainly
have
this
whenever
available
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color

faded
down
to

and
refreshing
piney

citrus
and
peppery
crisp
and

hit
the
spot
perfectly
at
happy

on
a

this
is
good
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
into
pint
glass
with
one
finger

that
disappates
quickly
little
to
no

aroma
is
pine
hops
with
some
carmel
malts
and
citrus

taste
is
primarily
pine
hops
with
enough
malt
backbone
to
keep
the
bitters
down
finish
is
not
as
dry
as
i
would
expect
with
this
amount
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
which
is
nice
for
an
apa
good
apa
but
nothing
spectacular
d
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
think
its
slightly
underrated
should
more
towards
an
89
try
it
and
youll
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
easy
drinking
very
flavorful
firstclass
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
for
hop
head
it
is
light
and
dry
with
a
low
abv
very
sessionable
id
love
to
buy
it
in
a
grocery
store
drinkability
great
this
is
a
good
everyday
drinking
beer
without
the
hoppy
bit
pours
a
orange
amber
color
with
a
large
beige
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
to
just
cover
the
beer
but
with
some
nice
lacing
nice
fruity
citrus
aromas
with
the
piney
hops
coming
through
apples
oranges
and
orange
rind
with
some
toasted
malt
and
big
hop
flaver
nicely
balanced
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
good
session
beer
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
a
decent
session
beer
at
under
5
abv
and
a
pleasingly
hoppy
one
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
to
session
while
playing
a
game
of
pool
as
virtually
everyone
else
was
doing
in
far
west
when
i
was
there
not
an
overly
impressive
apa
but
not
terrible
id
like
to
have
a
bit
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
and
the
biscuityyeasty
maltiness
get
a
bit
tiring
i
was
really
unimpressed
with
you
and
doubt
i
will
be
going
for
a
round
two
sucks
since
i
have
another
in
the
fridge
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
goldencopper
color
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
bold
of
hops
wow
this
beer
is
very
hoppy
with
enough
malt
to
counteract
the
bitterness
it
ends
up
being
quite
flavorful
and
works
well
the
mouthfeel
is
full
this
is
a
delightful
ale

id
recommend
it
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
big
hopped
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
tasted
fantastic
happy
orange
tint
with
a
little
red
amber
color
pours
a
nice
3
finger
foamy
head
off
white
and
thick
the
head
stays
around
and
some
lacing
is
noticed
the
nose
is
amazing
it
smells
exactly
like
snipping
open
a
sealed
bag
of
hops
ill
decline
to
comment
on
the
flavor
i
suspect
light
or
heat
spoiling
at
some
point
it
was
very
bad
i
could
detect
a
recognizable
sweet
malty
finish
i
didnt
notice
any
serious
evidence
of
ipaesque
ibus
poured
a
deep
orange
almost
brown
and
very
cloudy
the
citrus
smell
was
very
noticeable
with
mostly
grapefruit
and
orange
coming
through
as
the
label
states
hazed
and
infused
with
hops
which
held
true
highly
drinkable
and
the
hops
were
the
main
characteristic
they
were
not
overwhelming
nice
enjoyable
beer
a
redtinged
orange
pour
donning
a
cap
of
offwhite
foam
that
laces
pretty
well
that
head
abetted
by
some
active
carbonation
helps
feed
the
aggressive
nose
on
this
one
no
surprise
that
hops
are
at
the
forefront
largely
citrus
by
some
floral
as
well
while
i
expected
the
hops
were
largely
masking
the
malts
the
taste
suggests
that
the
malts
are
lacking
in
general
while
that
imbalance
is
unfortunate
the
effect
is
moderated
by
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
relatively
light
in
body
the
hops
arent
clingy
or
astringent
but
that
doesnt
make
up
for
the
lack
of
a
decent
malt
base
reasonably
drinkable
but
not
particularly
inspiring
this
beer
had
a
fruity
taste
and
a
clrean
fresh
finish
can
see
eating
with
some
mexican
food
on
a
hot
day
d
highly
drinkable
if
you
are
a
hops
person
hops
do
not
overpower
but
neither
are
they
shy
d
the
abv
is
low
and
the
flavor
is
big
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
overall
not
too
bad
hazed
infused
pours
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
producing
a
nice
rich
and
frothy
head
the
body
is
orangish
and
slightly
hazy
not
as
hazy
as
i
thought
due
to
the
naming
of
this
brew
this
gives
off
strong
hop
aromas
to
include
a
vivid
piney
fragrance
the
taste
is
dominated
initially
dominated
by
hops
but
finishes
with
little
aftertaste
i
was
quite
surprised
i
dont
feel
this
brew
is
balanced
enough
and
probably
could
use
a
little
bit
more
malt
characteristics
drinkabilitynotes
my
buddy
in
fla
has
been
talking
this
one
up
for
a
while
now
so
my
broinlaw
in
denver
picks
one
up
for
me
for
xmas
a
decent
apa
but
nothing
really
to
get
excited
about
pretty
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
the
provides
the
underlying
caramelbrown
sugar
like
sweetness
that
is
topped
by
a
fairly
decent
hop
bitterness
aroma
was
not
what
i
usually
expect
from
a
dryhopped
beer
definitely
and
easy
drinker
or
session
beer
especially
at
4
8
abv
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
but
its
worth
a
try
the
beer
poured
rusty
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
went
away
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
it
smelled
alright
nothing
special
hops
for
sure
but
not
much
citrus
or
spice
taste
like
the
smell
was
average
kind
of
weak
even
for
a
apa
felt
a
little
thick
and
malty
in
my
mouth
finished
dry
which
is
important
for
a
pale
ale
i
could
and
did
finish
my
sixer
in
the
setting
a
solid
beer
tho
nothing
earth
shattering
the
lack
of
malt
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
and
crisp
brew
although
it
isnt
very
balanced
it
is
definitely
interesting
hazed
and
infused
is
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again

i

i
like

i
like

a

a

is
a

thin

finishes
a

any

at

brings

down
some
everything
aside
from
the
taste
is
as
i
remembered
it
taste
though
was
a
big
disappointment
a
pretty
decent
pale
session
worthy
and
worth
a
try
nothing

just
a

this
beer
was

in
a

at
the

house
smells
of

a
bite
of

the

mainly
of
hops

a

the

linger
in
the

and
into
the
third
taste
easy
drinking
for
an
apa
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
the
first
beer
that
ive
sat
down
and
reviewed
in
fc
the
past
hundred
or
so
ive
been
selfish
and
just
drank
for
enjoyment
id
drink
again
if
my
cousin
brings
it
over
again
the
thinner
side
of
medium
body
sort
suits
its
dominating
hops
lending
a
little
to
drinkability
which
is
quite
good
its
very
hoppy
but
not
harsh
in
the
slightest
really
quite
nice
even
if
it
is
more
on
the
ipa
side
of
things
i
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
i
got
this
brew
on
tap
at
tanks
taproom
in
tampa
fl
the
bartender
said
it
was
a
fast
seller
and
i
can
see
why
this
brew
had
a
nice
bit
of
fluffy
head
that
left
lots
of
fluffy
and
sticky
lace
but
did
have
high
retention
the
smell
was
the
only
aspect
that
was
less
than
good
it
was
just
weak
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
like
a
hops
explosion
in
your
mouth
very
drinkable
dont
drink
and
review
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
this
would
be
a
tasty
session
beer
id
like
to
try
it
as
fresh
as
possible
as
im
sure
that
would
improve
the
taste
it
does
leave
me
with
a
nice
hopburp
i
tried
this
while
visiting
boulder
at
illegal
petes
on
pearl
st
along
with
a
burrito
a
highly
recommended
combination
had
this
beer
on
tap
the
other
night
the
brew
had
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
beige
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aromas
of
this
brew
where
of
both
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
hops
gave
it
a
citrus
like
scent
that
was
more
dominant
but
played
nicely
with
the
malt
the
taste
was
nice
the
hops
where
not
over
baring
and
actually
where
not
overly
noticeable
till
the
middle
and
end
of
a
sip
the
malt
was
the
first
thing
that
i
was
able
to
notice
a
nice
sweet
caramel
flavor
that
was
a
great
start
to
this
beer
over
all
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
one
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
an
evening
with
first
offering
from
boulder
but
now
has
my
interest
and
will
look
for
more
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
on
a
hot
summer
day
great
taste
ballanced
and
with
a
lowaverage
abv
it
is
something
that
you
can
enjoy
many
of
without
killing
yourself
d
excellent
but
the
dry
hopped
acidity
can
become
a
bit
harsh
after
two
or
three
the
body
has
mid
to
light
feel
carbonation
is
somewhat
high
that
is
amplified
by
the
citrus
zing
from
the
hops
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
hops
in
all
of
us
youd
be
crazy
delusional
not
to
try
it
extremely
drinkable
offering
here
from
boulder
who
seldomly
dissapoints
this
is
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangish
copper
color
with
a
spotty
lace
smell
is
dominated
by
a
nice
array
of
fresh
citrusy
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
pine
as
well
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
hops
as
they
are
all
over
the
place
overall
this
is
not
a
terrible
apa
but
it
really
lacks
in
balance
if
it
had
a
little
more
of
a
malt
presence
it
would
take
this
brew
to
another
level
not
bad
just
not
something
i
will
likely
get
again
the
mouth
is
light
has
great
carbonation
but
is
a
bit
uneven
and
lacks
complexity
this
is
very
drinkable
maybe
good
as
a
refreshment
or
with
certain
foods
but
doesnt
offer
much
in
the
way
of
character
or
complexity
solid
for
summer
session
beer
next
time
i
had
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
it
really
hit
the
spot
taste
is
probably
more
like
a
4
but
the
drinkability
suffers
since
its
hit
or
miss
depending
on
your
mood
but
the
taste
yeah
it
was
hoppy
but
lacking
any
real
flavor
very
surprising
dry
and
tart
it
was
worth
a
try
and
would
have
another

if
offered
or
available
da
another
hoppy
wonder
note
i
hadnt
drank
this
beer
in
a
while
and
had
one
a
few
weeks
back
that
basically
tasted
liked
nothing
this
beer
came
from
a
fresh
case
and
is
outstanding
so
try
and
drink
this
one
fresh
mouthfeel

it

wow
the

just
jump

im

oh
it

so
right
on

heh
the

taste
is
extremely
forward
pretty
much
dominating
everything
nice
substantial
savory
pinetype
flavor
its
followed
up
by
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
nothing
else
hm
i
actually
like
the
minimal
bitterness
but
the
accompanying
malt
flavor
is
a
touch
cloying
should
be
a
little
drier
still
just
the
fact
that
i
get
to
smell
this
one
every
time
i
take
a
sip
is
its
saving
grace
yum
on
tap
at
brix
in
jacksonville
beach
a
clear
copper
colored
brew
with
a
small
offwhite
head
which
faded
rather
fast
beer
was
served
quite
cold
so
aroma
was
muted
flavor
was
a
pinecitrus
hop
for
the
most
part
with
enough
malt
to
balance
it
but
still
leave
it
in
the
hoplovers
camp
body
was
medium
as
was
the
carbonation
refreshing
and
slightly
drying
overall
a
very
drinkable
apa
which
sneaks
up
on
being
an
ipa
drinkability
while
i
guess
i
cant
fault
this
beer
too
much
for
trying
to
go
look
lk
at
me
i
have
to
acknowledge
the
big
blank
spot
when
it
comes
to
any
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
i
am
not
typically
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
and
tasting
this
reminded
me
why
i
dont
like
them
on
the
other
hand
if
you
like
bold
bitter
hoppy
beers
give
this
a
try
it
is
sure
to
give
your
tastebuds
a
kick
the
hops
had
more
countenance
in
the
aroma
and
feel
than
in
the
flavor
and
that
was
one
low
point
another
was
the
overall
thin
nature
in
the
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
the
lightness
makes
it
all
the
more
drinkable
because
what
is
there
is
actually
tasty
so
while
im
not
wowed
or
even
especially
impressed
i
will
say
that
id
have
it
again
if
it
was
the
best
available
d
you
can
quaff
this
down
still
hoping
for
a
bigger
flavor
profile
though
enjoyed
with
lunch
at
the
brewpub
started
with
a
normal
hazed
my
usual
here
but
then
found
out
they
had
it
on
cask
looks
a
bit
cloudier
than
usual
with
a
nice
solid
head
tons
of
lacing
as
it
drains
aroma
is
a
bit
more
subdued
but
still
nicely
balanced
and
hoppy
great
mouthfeel
as
youd
expect
nice
and
creamy
taste
is
very
well
balanced
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
d
very
enjoyable
id
have
another
nice
dry
hopping
lingering
malt
flavors
were
nice
id
say
this
is
more
of
an
ipa
considering
flavor
and
color
uf
d
would
be
a
good
beer
for
working
in
yard
thin
thirst
quenching
but
i
expected
more
from
the
ultra
cool
name
and
funky
tiedye
bottle
marketing
wins
again
a
bit
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
not
really
one
that
i
want
to
have
another
of
this
is
my
second
experience
with
this
beer
more
or
less
confirming
my
first
impression
overall
i
think
this
has
a
significant
hop
presence
by
most
standard
apa
guidlines
another
solid
offering
from
boulder
beer
company
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
id
say
a
six
pack
of
this
brew
would
be
perfect
for
a
night
with
two
or
three
other
different
six
packs
of
course
crux
extremely
enjoyable
dryhopped
apa
here
a
beer
id
like
to
say
hello
to
again
and
again
but
alas
it
aint
available
near
me
yet
i
could
drink
this
anytime
con
mucho
gusto
and
the
dbf
yearns
to
hold
this
beer
in
its
embrace
in
some
quantity
good
stuff
had
a
pint
at
the
union
jack
pub
in
broad
ripple
in
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudy
goldenhued
orange
very
appealing
color
short
half
finger
off

slowly
decomposed
into
a
light
ring
of

is
fresh
citrusy
hops

notes
slight

also
present
taste
is
hoppy
and

in
the
dryness
of
the

very
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
oily
on
the
tongue
light
on
cabonation
as
well
goes
down

and

off

drinkability
is
excellent
great
beer
to
relax
with
after
being
in
the
late
july
sun
d
perfect
session
beer
with
something
sweet
or
a
pungent
cheese
one
final
note
i
had
this
twice
in
the
same
night
once
on
tap
at
bombers
in
albany
and
once
from
a
bottle
at
home
the
basis
of
this
review
as
i
could
take
notes
at
home
i
thought
it
was
a
little
bit
better
from
the
tap
d
drinkable
this
brew
surprised
me
for
sure
pretty
tasty
on
tap
at
an
outdoor
cafe
in
boulder
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
its
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
semithick
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
piney
and
flowery
hops
with
a
healthy
malt
aroma
behind
the
hops
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
being
a
bit
more
subdued
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
bread
and
biscuit
flavors
can
be
detected
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
heavier
than
expected
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
outdoors
on
a
warm
weekend
day
nice
stuff
drinkabilitynotes
a
remarkably
wellcrafted
example
of
the
style
a
very
fine
apa
which
exceeded
my
expectations
actually
nice
to
find
a
new
apa
in
these
dipa
days
recommended
enjoy
thin
mouthfeel
very
little
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable
for
a
pale
ale
its
ok
and
i
might
reassess
my
thoughts
on
this
one
someday
but
for
now
im
glad
i
bought
the
single
bottle
a
nice
solid
red
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
leaves
little
lace
smell
is
more
muted
than
i
would
have
thought
there
is
plenty
of
hoplike
aromas
but
nothing
juice
alive
or
otherwise
standoutish
the
taste
has
a
slight
malt
flavor
that
is
eaten
up
by
a
bittering
that
tastes
soapy
there
is
some
citrus
and
fruityness
but
they
are
just
too
weak
ok
mouthfeel
and
it
could
serve
as
something
to
drink
but
not
really
desirable
overall
this
is
just
another
passonby
until
they
tweak
it
up
some
well
the
drinkablilty
depends
as
a
beer
soso
if
you
are
a
hop
addict
moreso
imo
this
is
overthetop
if
a
hop
liquor
existed
in
place
of
a
malt
liquor
this
would
be
it
overall
a
decent
offering
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
the
looking
glass
line
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
a
summer
evening
while
watching
the
sun
set
not
very
complex
but
if
youre
a
hophead
itll
do
in
a
pinch
in
todays
world
of
big
beers
this
guy
just
isnt
big
enough
but
its
worth
a
try
12
0z
bottle
pours
out
a
pumpkinorange
color
it
had
a
small
head
but
still
left
some
lacing
it
smelled
very
hoppy
the
hop
flavor
wasnt
as
strong
as
the
smell
it
tasted
a
little
bit
of
herbs
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
sharp
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
this
was
a
nice
brew
that
seemed
like
it
was
caught
in
the
middle
and
couldnt
decide
if
it
was
an
ipa
or
a
straight
up
pale
ale
i
think
it
leans
a
bit
toward
the
former
but
its
still
very
good
even
if
it
not
100
the
latter
as
touted
its
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
just
a
very
nice
allaround
beer
overal
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
recommended
for
hop
heads
and
nonhop
heads
alike
drinkability
suffers
from
being
too
sweet
and
too
little
carbonation
but
overall
not
bad
eh
not
a
standout
among
dryhopped
beers
not
bad
but
hazed
aspect
seems
more
gimmicky
than
anything
else
this
is
really
good
for
a
hophead
highly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
d
a
nicely
balanced
apa
that
would
see
some
rotation
if
i
werent
busy
trying
new
beers
all
the
time
man
what
a
letdown
after
the
smell
this
beer
needs
something
to
hold
it
all
together
this
could
be
so
much
better
it
probably
is
fresh
on
tap
but
this
didnt
really
impress
me
all
that
much
dthis
is
great
one
i
will
return
to
again
and
again
could
be
a
wonderful
session
beer
for
hop
lovers
poured
well
a
hazed
copper
with
a
tinge
of
orange
with
a
tight
but
thinner
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
quite
awhile
there
is
a
nice
herbalpiney
hop
profile
in
the
aroma
if
not
a
little
subtle
it
was
pleasant
i
dectected
a
touch
of
caramel
underneath
as
well
a
well
balanced
pale
with
the
piney
citric
hop
winning
out
by
a
narrow
margin
over
the
light
caramel
malt
backbone
i
think
a
real
quaffing
type
ale
flavorfullow
in
alc
and
well
balanced
if
you
happen
to
reach
for
sierra
nevada
when
you
want
a
pale
ale
then
this
might
not
be
for
you
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
pretty
juicy
almost
cran
apple
without
being
cloying
then
this
would
fit
the
bill
im
sure
this
must
appeal
to
many
but
im
not
that
crazy
about
this
one
hazy
burnt
orangecopper
beneath
a
creamy
white
head
trails
of
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
sides
bright
pine
and
spruce
aromas
along
with
lemon
grapefruit
and
floral
hop
resins
gritty
yet
bright
spruce
flavors
the
floral
hop
character
is
a
bit
coarse
which
allows
for
a
light
bitterness
followed
by
a
lemon
and
hop
resin
aftertatse
light
with
a
touch
of
coarseness
on
the
palate
mainly
just
a
light
oily
mouthfeel
nice
bright
flavors
drinks
well
out
of
the
bottle
worth
a
try
for
the
novelty
only
ogt
to
sample
a
little
of
this
at
a
tasting
so
i
bought
a
6
pack
very
hoppy
and
nice
and
crisp
i
thought
it
was
very
flavorfull
with
some
natural
hints
of
fruits
but
subtle
enough
not
to
drown
on
the
taste
all
in
all
in
you
like
a
pale
ale
i
would
say
try
it
this
was
one
of
the
first
hoppy
beers
i
ever
tasted
i
remember
sneaking
a
6pack
of
this
up
during
a
summer
church
retreat
when
i
was
15
i
struggled
through
each
bottle
as
i
definately
could
not
deal
with
the
hoppiness
now
i
find
it
a
little
too
subtle
deep
orange
gentle
yet
aromatic
hoppy
aroma
with
scents
of
pine
pineapple
cocunut
juice
orange
and
grapefruit
fruity
malt
body
providing
notes
of
butter
toffee
and
caramel
interesting
oily
hop
flavor
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
pine
i
usually
love
centennial
hopped
beer
but
not
this
particular
one
watery
texture
and
not
very
well
balanced
pours
a
slightly
dark
murky
color
good
lacing
and
retention
the
compliments
end
there
aroma
is
okay
hoppy
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
driven
out
by
mouthfeel
this
is
overcarbed
to
the
point
of
being
distracting
almost
a
very
sharp
note
body
is
hard
to
grasp
not
a
winner
in
my
book
drinkabilty
not
bad
would
have
it
again
on
tap
pours
a
rich
amber
thin
head
not
much
lace
smell
was
of
citrus
grapefruit
in
particular
very
inviting
body
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
taste
is
citrus
and
is
nicely
hopped
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
good
beer
try
one
soon
interesting
itll
be
too
heavy
handed
for
some
folks
but
fans
of
hops
will
love
it
taste
is
suprisingly
malty
as
the
hops
seem
to
struggle
to
come
through
with
a
citrussy
bite
at
the
end
starts
with
a
smooth
caramel
malt
undertone
which
leads
to
the
grapfruit
blast
of
a
finish
interesting
balance
in
this
pale
ale
amazingly
not
dominated
by
hops
decent
drinkability
in
this
well
carbonated
offering
nothing
special
but
worth
a
try
overall
drinkability
is
high
not
as
good
as
founders
dry
hop
but
still
worth
trying
if
you
can
pick
it
up
22
ounce
bomber
only
2
99
poured
a
nice
copper
color
wth
a
two
finger
head
more
of
an
ipa
taste
in
my
opinion
good
hop
aroma
and
flavor
up
front
nicely
balanced
with
malty
notes
finishes
crisp
less
aggresive
than
boulders
mojo
ipa
and
better
balanced
an
excellent
session
brew
bottom
line
heres
a
very
flavourful
apa
that
only
tips
the
scales
at
4
85abv
thus
making
it
a
good
candidate
for
a
session
beer
i
recommend
it
thie
brew
pours
a
hazy
deep
red
color
the
head
is
twofingers
in
hieght
fluffy
and
receds
very
slowly
into
thorough
lacing
this
is
a
great
looking
pale
ale
the
aroma
screams
of
centenial
hops
all
big
and
juicy
citrus
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
rather
mild
compared
to
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
mighty
fine
pale
ale
it
is
hard
to
believe
this
much
flavor
and
aroma
can
come
out
of
a
beer
that
is
only
4
85
abv
pours
a
hazy
copper
amber
with
a
thick
frothybubbly
head
with
a
good
lacing
mostly
all
the
way
down
the
glass
so
lots
of
malts
present
another
boulder
beer
that
is
just
what
a
beer
should
look
like
smells
of
lots
o
hops
piney
and
lots
of
citris
really
a
quite
smooth
beer
slightly
carbonated
i
thought
there
would
be
more
carbonation
and
while
i
would
have
liked
more
action
smooth
and
crisp
is
nice
taste
is
good
with
lots
of
hops
crisp
and
piney
and
citric
a
kind
of
apple
thing
going
the
malts
are
pretty
much
completely
disguised
so
much
hop
going
on
basically
i
like
this
beer
i
have
it
a
lot
and
while
its
not
the
most
refined
beer
out
there
id
have
this
one
most
any
day
meh
this
one
needs
some
balance
and
depth
if
you
just
want
to
taste
some
hops
go
ahead
bottoms
up
but
if
you
want
a
decent
beer
with
hop
character
malt
notes
and
something
interesting
going
on
tastewise
move
along
pours
a
light
copper
color
topped
by
a
small
creamy
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
very
long
aroma
is
very
citrusy
and
grapefruity
with
a
touch
of
piney
hops
palate
is
huge
on
the
hops
citrus
and
pine
balanced
nicely
by
some
light
caramel
malt
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
flavorful
beer
a
good
fruity
hoppy
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
hand
carried
back
from
albuquerque
i
purchased
a
mixed
six
of
boulder
beers
this
one
sounded
real
interesting
so
i
tried
it
first
true
to
the
label
it
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
color
really
nice
aroma
really
nice
hoppy
taste
somewhat
aggressive
hoppiness
as
would
be
expected
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
highly
this
beer
is
utterly
drinkable
the
fresh
green
feeling
is
so
conducive
to
rapid
swigging
very
nice
beer

i
find
myself
being
particularly
fond
of
this
beer
in
cans
the
low
alcohol
makes
it
ultra
drinkable
and
the
dry
hopped
amarillo
character
speaks
to
me
its
good
stuff
hey
first
timer
here
and
seeing
as
how
im
only
21
take
this
review
as
you
will
this
has
been
one
my
favorites
since
i
started
to
shop
over
at
trader
joes
it
has
a
very
nice
hoppy
aroma
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
and
it
gets
stronger
as
you
pour
the
taste
is
also
very
fresh
and
hoppy
it
is
like
someone
just
picked
the
hops
and
barley
and
tossed
them
in
the
brew
i
pickup
a
sixpack
of
this
every
time
i
try
a
new
brew
as
a
bonafied
backup
in
case
i
dont
like
my
new
selection
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
in
this
one
if
your
choose
to
pick
it
up
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
while
at
the
same
time
smooth
enough
to
be
very
drinkable
i
grabbed
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
6er
and
it
is
suprisingly
a
good
brew
the
stoner
label
is
a
little
cheesy
though
its
an
average
looking
beer
okay
i
dont
know
for
sure
if
that
matters
at
all
i
dont
usually
pour
this
beer
when
i
do
and
i
should
more
often
it
is
pungent
smells
more
than
a
little
like
marijuana
taste
is
really
remarkable
it
has
this
super
fresh
sweet
hoppy
thing
going
on
thats
accenter
with
corriander
like
explosiveness
its
like
a
cross
between
fresh
hops
and
great
indian
food
which
i
think
this
would
complement
really
nicely
overall
though
this
instense
flavor
isnt
so
intense
that
youre
not
tempted
to
grab
another
theres
nothning
unusual
about
how
quickly
i
reach
or
anything
memorable
about
how
it
feels
in
the
mouth
it
goes
down
good
ive
never
evaluated
the
after
effect
of
more
than
2
of
these
but
i
can
say
it
doesnt
go
to
the
head
too
quickly
tastes
really
fresh
and
drinkable
but
just
a
tad
too
hoppy
to
make
this
a
session
brew
on
my
regular
rotation
to
be
sure
very
interesting
apa
somehow
i
expected
more
hops
pours
brownish
red
and
has
an
intense
vegetable
quality
on
the
nose
normally
that
would
be
offensive
but
somehow
it
seems
to
work
here
at
first
it
smelled
like
broccoli
but
after
another
whiff
it
comes
off
like
an
asparagusavocado
mix
this
beer
drinks
real
easy
too
the
head
was
also
good
and
the
cascade
seemed
strong
enough
too
a
good
apa
worth
putting
on
your
list
drinkability
is
good
but
not
outstanding
it
is
a
shame
that
this
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
an
excellent
beer
to
show
the
difference
between
bittering
hops
and
aroma
hops
i
will
buy
this
again
every
now
and
then
just
for
the
smell
and
it
doesnt
taste
bad
either
in
my
opinion
buy
this
beer
to
experience
a
truly
unique
and
bold
aroma
that
single
aspect
is
worth
it
in
this
case
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
12
pillowy
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
amber
brew
head
lasts
very
nicely
with
heavy
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
pungent
green
hops
with
a
sweet
malt
undercurrent
taste
melds
the
seemingly
fresh
hops
character
with
the
biscuity
malts
almost
perfectly
dont
really
know
how
it
could
be
better
mouthfeel
is
supersmooth
and
drinkability
is
trememndous
as
well
a
great
one
here
oops
actually
put
this
under
the
mojo
but
this
was
the
beer
i
reviewed
heavy
session
that
night0
light
enough
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
but
with
enough
depth
to
keep
you
warm
on
a
cold
night
like
tonight
hazed
and
infused
grew
quickly
on
me
and
hasnt
quite
let
go
of
me
yet
just
like
the
lacing
on
the
top
of
the
glass
as
im
about
to
take
my
last
sip
out
of
my
pint
glass
the
best
features
of
an
ipa
a
dryhopped
beer
and
solid
craftmanship
are
evident
here
highly
recommended
had
a
few
more
bottles
and
really
enjoyed
it
great
hops
aroma
and
flavor
still
easy
to
drink
and
the
bitterness
doesnt
become
overpowering
great
for
young
and
developing
hopheads
good
session
beer
i
like
the
hops
but
a
little
too
pricey
around
these
parts
to
warrant
a
revist
pours
a
hazy
medium
orangecopper
with
a
small
foamy
offwhite
slowly
diminishing
head
good
thick
lacing
the
smell
is
fresh
hoppy
and
wonderful
citrus
and
spruce
balanced
by
a
moderate
doughy
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
a
bigtime
hopattack
it
has
an
initial
sting
of
firey
citrus
and
then
it
subsides
very
briefly
to
let
the
malts
add
their
2
cents
but
those
flavors
are
quickly
drowned
by
a
tidal
wave
of
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
but
then
something
goes
a
bit
off
late
on
the
finish
no
its
not
off
just
weak
i
think
its
just
too
far
out
of
balance
strange
because
the
smell
and
the
early
flavors
a
bit
more
balanced
than
the
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
i
think
this
beer
starts
out
like
a
topquality
beer
but
finishes
barely
above
average
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
this
on
tap
and
bottle
in
the
last
week
or
so
in
either
case
this
beer
was
damn
good
it
has
a
heavy
pretty
copper
color
but
is
also
really
well
hazy
it
has
a
decent
head
with
thin
lace
hops
are
balanced
and
boy
oh
boy
do
they
make
this
beer
id
love
to
have
a
mini
keg
of
this
for
tailgating
as
i
think
anyone
would
like
this
beer
this
is
a
very
dry
hop
citrus
beer
its
a
very
good
flavor
the
mf
is
a
little
light
for
my
tastebut
the
drinkability
is
very
good
if
i
see
this
again
i
will
buy
it
very
nice
beer
overall
id
be
glad
to
have
a
keg
of
this
at
home
and
proud
to
serve
it
any
any
group
event
i
found
this
an
excellent
beer
for
drinking
with
loads
of
flavour
and
amoderate
alcohol
content
recommended
this
beer
is
good
from
all
angles
it
has
a
heavy
copper
tone
and
a
slight
bit
of
ruby
red
on
the
pour
going
with
the
hazed
theme
the
beer
is
quite
murky
the
head
is
some
what
small
and
has
of
thin
lace
great
balance
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
the
dry
hops
scalp
your
mouth
in
a
good
way
there
even
brought
out
as
it
warms
up
i
think
the
hops
are
what
really
make
this
beer
the
medium
body
makes
this
beer
good
t
o
drink
for
all
seasons
drinkability
more
an
ipa
offshoot
than
a
pale
ale
still
a
good
drinking
beer
though
low
abv
makes
this
think
a
decent
session
brew
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
oily
though
it
remains
quite
drinkable
nice
looking
beer
that
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
good
head
retention
leaving
a
nice
splotchy
lacing
nose
is
of
malts
and
floral
hops
initial
taste
had
a
predominant
finish
of
the
sweeter
citrus
and
of
course
hops
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
thick
body
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
makes
for
a
very
nice
session
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
at
first
since
the
label
leads
you
to
believe
that
its
an
ipa
but
as
a
low
abv
apa
it
makes
a
really
nice
session
beer
hazed
and
infused
is
a
good
beer
i
have
had
it
both
off
the
tap
and
from
a
botle
it
is
remarkable
similar
from
both
serving
types
this
review
is
from
notes
about
a
bottle
it
pours
the
color
of
good
medium
maple
syrup
but
one
wiff
and
you
can
tell
it
does
not
taste
anything
like
syrup
the
nise
hits
you
with
deep
pine
and
grapfruit
which
carry
through
the
swalow
the
tast
is
so
srong
that
once
its
down
your
moth
feels
like
you
were
just
chewing
on
a
fresh
cascaid
hop
bud
nonetheless
it
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
my
only
comment
is
that
it
might
not
bee
a
great
beer
in
a
seires
of
tastings
buecause
its
taste
is
so
strong
it
compromises
your
pallet
this
is
one
of
those
throw
as
much
hops
at
them
as
we
can
american
apas
and
its
one
of
the
ones
that
work
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
nicely
refreshing
beer
that
amazingly
enough
it
doesnt
have
a
harsh
bitter
bite
on
the
back
of
the
throat
like
most
other
over
the
top
american
ipas
its
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
i
would
definitely
drink
one
again
smell
is
nothing
but
bubblegumcandylikegrapefruitoverlyhopped
greatness
this
is
my
kinda
beer
this
thing
is
supposed
to
be
a
pale
ale
well
if
its
a
pale
ale
then
i
play
guitar
in
pearl
jam
because
both
couldnt
be
further
from
the
truth
ok
maybe
its
a
bit
more
realistic
to
call
this
a
pale
ale
but
you
get
the
point
the
crystal
centennial
hops
shine
through
in
this
willy
wonkalike
creation
wellbalanced
it
is
not
but
who
cares
this
is
a
tribute
to
hops
and
amen
to
that
very
glad
i
didnt
pass
this
brew
by
oh
dear
thats
much
too
thin
theres
no
follow
through
here
yeah
theres
some
sourness
but
without
the
punch
this
has
the
malt
character
of
watery
grey
oatmeal
and
watery
cranberry
juice
bland
dammit
why
waste
ingredients
on
this
fake
keep
in
mind
that
if
there
were
a
fragrance
that
smelled
like
hops
i
would
buy
it
i
really
like
this
beer
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
small
white
head
that
retained
well
but
wasnt
enough
the
hops
aroma
of
this
beer
was
ridiculously
overpowering
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
bag
of
hops
awesome
the
taste
was
unbalanced
like
other
raters
have
said
and
could
use
some
more
malt
to
strengthen
it
overall
but
i
will
totally
buy
this
anytime
i
need
a
hop
fix
plus
the
lightthin
nature
of
the
beer
due
to
the
lack
of
malt
makes
it
easier
to
drink
lots
of
a
good
6
pack
hop
fest
drinkability
a
little
better
than
average
if
you
can
keep
it
from
spewing
overall
i
liked
it
i
wouldnt
complain
if
i
drank
it
again
okay
im
a
sap
i
really
like
this
beer
even
if
it
is
unbalanced
and
not
true
to
the
style
so
what
i
like
it
when
brewers
take
chances
that
result
in
something
special
still
this
is
close
enough
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
highly
hopped
apa
or
an
ipa
i
think
an
open
mind
and
a
love
of
hops
will
make
this
a
superior
beer
offering
in
my
home
d
this
beer
is
ok
but
not
real
complex
or
exciting
it
might
be
an
old
bottle
and
i
will
have
to
review
another
but
its
just
not
that
exciting
pours
a
hazy
if
you
can
believe
that
amber
with
a
big
rocky
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
lots
of
lace
this
is
a
pretty
attractive
beer
aroma
is
100
bitter
grapefruity
hops
the
flavor
is
not
harsh
as
the
nose
suggests
but
its
still
dominated
by
grapefruity
hops
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
pokes
through
but
is
quickly
slapped
down
nice
mouthfeel
and
reasonably
drinkable
but
i
find
the
overly
citric
hop
character
to
be
cloying
out
of
wack
for
a
pale
ale
but
i
suppose
it
makes
a
decent
hop
fix
if
thats
what
you
crave
this
review
is
based
on
a
12
oz
dark
brown
bottle
ive
recenly
purchased
i
also
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
was
a
lot
better
the
freshness
date
is
stamped
on
the
neck
but
it
is
barely
visible
i
only
found
it
after
looking
through
other
reviews
my
bottle
was
almost
a
year
old
so
this
probably
contributed
to
less
than
expected
experience
ill
keep
looking
for
a
fresher
bottle
but
for
now
this
review
stands
theres
a
background
sweetness
in
this
beer
with
a
following
of
hop
flavor
in
the
end
this
beer
is
very
dry
in
your
mouth
and
leave
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
not
the
most
enjoyable
not
bad
but
just
not
my
favorite
ipa
all
in
all
its
what
id
call
a
hopheadlight
beer
enough
hops
to
get
your
attention
but
not
overpowering
in
its
bitterness
or
possesing
a
hight
abv
however
it
makes
for
an
easydrinking
and
reasonably
good
session
beer
and
a
good
beer
to
expand
ones
hop
horizons
on
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
okay
a
little
watery
drinkability
eh
i
cant
see
myself
really
grabbing
another
one
of
these
its
a
decent
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
more
ipay
than
i
wanted
and
the
flavor
just
bombs
against
the
smell
but
hey
you
gotta
try
everything
once
this
beer
is
all
about
the
nose
the
dry
hopping
clearly
comes
through
its
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
bag
of
hops
the
taste
is
citrusy
and
piney
with
medium
bitterness
and
hardly
any
malt
feels
really
thin
in
the
mouth
but
is
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
too
hoppy
for
a
classic
apa
if
the
mojo
ipa
had
the
aroma
of
hazed
and
infused
it
would
be
a
top
ipa
overall
nicely
hopped
without
being
overpowering
and
theres
enough
maltiness
that
you
can
drink
a
few
moderately
thick
dense
light
cream
colored
head
fades
to
a
thin
coating
leaving
a
patch
sheet
of
lace
nice
juicy
citrus
hop
aroma
that
has
a
spicy
note
to
it
transparent
light
amber
colored
beer
is
a
bit
hazy
what
happened
it
smelled
so
good
there
is
barely
any
flavor
maybe
a
pinch
of
tea
flavored
hops
but
nothing
like
the
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
chewy
grapefruit
hop
flavor
that
fades
in
towards
the
end
but
by
then
its
too
late
moderately
light
body
and
its
really
fizzy
across
the
tongue
maybe
the
carbonation
is
stripping
away
the
flavor
ah
whatever
its
decent
but
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
after
the
first
glance
and
sniff
a
decent
good
looking
and
good
smelling
beer
a
good
hot
day
session
beer
crisp
and
very
drinkable
not
one
of
the
true
standouts
of
the
style
though
with
a
bit
of
an
unfinished
taste
to
it
pretty
good
pucker
from
the
hops
which
start
with
a
tad
of
citrus
and
end
piney
but
there
is
just
not
enough
of
it
inbetween
to
make
it
one
of
the
elite
impression
a
nice
summertime
beer
for
thirst
quenching
nice
beer
to
pick
up
along
the
way
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
as
always
drinkability
is
key
and
this
one
doesnt
lack
in
that
factor
availability
is
also
key
and
this
will
probably
be
the
last
bottle
of
beer
from
rockies
that
i
see
unless
they
start
getting
a
new
belgium
style
following
out
here
there
are
too
many
better
pales
out
there
for
me
to
make
much
effort
in
seeking
this
out
again
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
an
unimpressive
pale
ale
from
whats
turning
out
to
be
an
unimpressive
brewery
for
me
bland
and
boring
this
beer
looks
good
but
has
no
real
flavor
the
mojo
was
better
and
thats
not
saying
much
drinkability
well
since
it
isnt
overly
hoppy
or
too
oily
or
filling
i
could
see
how
someone
could
have
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
it
werent
for
the
taste
i
like
the
name
of
this
ale
and
i
like
the
beer
itself
though
i
can
foresee
that
others
wont
care
for
it
it
is
a
bit
unusual
all
the
goodness
of
hazed
infused
in
the
bottle
without
the
chunky
particles
i
experienced
in
the
bottle
which
i
suspected
had
a
bit
of
age
behind
it
nice
soft
lacing
lots
of
fresh
hop
aroma
without
the
traditional
cascades
other
than
a
bit
in
the
kettle
but
not
in
the
aroma
nicely
balanced
provided
a
rather
thin
body
wonderfully
balanced
and
drinkable
a
new
to
pa
sessioner
pale
ale
that
stands
up
amongst
the
best
of
em
the
secret
is
in

pours
out
a
clear
light

color
with
a
small

the
head
shrinks
away
leaving
a
slight
scattering
of
sticky
lace
fresh
hoppy
aroma
with
plenty
of
floral
and
citric
hops
a
bit
piney
and
solid
malt
backing
the
hops
up
flavor
starts
with
a
sweet
caramel
before
a
lighter
than
expected
citric
hop
bitterness
comes
in
the
nose
definitely
has
more
hop
presence
than
the
flavor
a
bit
weaker
than
i
like
but
still
tasty
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
goes
down
smooth
easy
drinking
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
thanks
to
secret
bunny
05
and
nvsblman
for
the
brew
bottom
line
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
if
it
were
readily
available
here
in
philly
why
dont
get
me
wrong
hopdevil
would
remain
a
staple
of
my
diet
and
i
would
still
purchase
it
in
mass
but
this
is
hoppy
and
much
much
lighter
than
the
devil
and
the
abv
is
lower
this
all
equates
to
being
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
without
leaving
me
feeling
like
i
ate
a
5
course
meal
very
nice
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
deck
and
a
session
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
notes
its
flavor
is
very
hoppy
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
it
is
very
nice
to
have
a
beer
dryhopped
with
something
besides
cascade
not
that
cascade
hops
are
bad
just
used
by
everyone
all
in
all
it
is
a
pretty
damn
good
apa
nice
and
hoppy
and
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
very
quaffable
this
would
be
a
good
everyday
beer
for
hopheads
there
are
betters
out
there
but
this
definitely
scratches
the
hop
itch
well
that
being
said
im
not
quite
sure
what
encouraged
me
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
but
i
did
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
pours
ambercopper
in
color
and
the
citrusy
smell
of
the
hops
hits
the
nose
with
just
enough
punch
to
push
you
to
tip
the
glass
the
flavor
is
that
of
an
apa
with
sweet
malt
and
a
citrus
bite
but
not
just
a
little
a
lot
of
hop
mmm
hops
id
buy
this
again
edit
as
one
of
my
other
fellow
reviewers
said
this
reminds
me
of
the
stickiest
of
the
icky
a
very
interesting
apa
part
of
the
looking
glass
series
of
specialty
beers
from
this
brewery
according
to
the
label
this
pours
a
mildly
hazed
amber
body
with
a
large
rocky
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
clingly
clumps
of
lace
are
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
all
hops
but
are
smooth
and
citrusy
mostly
fresh
peeled
orange
grassy
and
lemony
hop
notes
are
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
taste
underwhelms
with
orange
and
pink
grapefruity
hops
caramel
and
pale
malt
sweetness
is
very
understated
nothing
really
special
here
as
the
hops
and
malts
are
both
restrained
the
result
is
an
extremely
drinkable
and
well
balanced
ale
that
is
highly
sessionable
i
could
knock
down
several
of
these
if
i
were
thirsty
poured
a
rich
amber
honey
nice
color
with
a
short
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
cascading
whitewashed
lace
with
varing
sized
bubbles
the
flowery
hops
and
fruitsweet
filled
the
nose
ending
with
a
slight
bitter
perhaps
white
pine
the
taste
was
smooth
crisp
light
with
a
lot
of
hops
these
hops
are
more
aligned
with
the
nose
more
their
subtle
essence
flowery
versus
the
bitter
the
carbonation
and
dryness
rise
this
up
to
the
soft
palate
and
finishes
i
found
this
finish
a
bit
thin
and
just
prior
watery
once
the
mouthful
was
gone
there
was
no
palate
memory
of
the
first
23rds
of
the
taste
despite
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
i
appreciated
the
recommmendation
to
meet
this
subtleflowery
quality
of
hops
cloudy
copper
beer
with
a
typical
ipa
cream
colored
head
just
looks
right
however
a
nice
even
bitterness
that
is
somehow
rounded
out
by
the
malts
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
refreshing
to

wish
i
had
a

more
of
em
this
is
kind
of
a
biased
rating
because
it
wasnt
close

fresh
i
like
to
remember
what
i
have
had
so
i
gave
the
ratings

high

on

the
recedes

the

initially
i
smell
and
taste
the
hops
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
astringency
in
a
sip
or
two
i
am
accustomed
to
hops
and
the
malt
begins
to
shine
there
is
some
sweetness
and
toastiness
and
as
i
drain
the
glass
toasty
recedes
and
something
like
chocolate
takes
its
place
did
they
use
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
to
increase
color
tasted
like
a

heavy
piece

hopefully
the
just
oversparged
this
batch
very
drinkable
and
smooth
great
midwestern
ipa
smells
even
better
than
it
tastes
herbal
grassy
touch
of
citrus
and
fairly
bitter
and
resiny
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
good
ipanice
smooth
taste
overall
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
cascade
hops
were
the
sole
hops
used
in
this
beer
albeit
they
have
been
added
in
eleven
separate
additions
i
was
expecting
something
different
given
the
interesting
tropical
fruit
tones
in
any
event
quite
a
good
pale
ale
and
a
solid
flagship
beer
for
this
brewery
creamy
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
beers
nice
and
fragrant
with
decent
bite
but
not
overly
fruity
so
i
at
lease
can
session
this
beer
this
beer
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
ale
asylum
grew
so
fast
brownish
yellow
color
white
head
slight
flowery
smell
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
this
is
the
original
beer
that
got
me
into
hops
a
really
pleasant
almost
classic
pale
ale
that
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
in
its
heyday
theres
a
really
strong
grapefruit
and
orange
scent
that
is
mirrored
in
the
taste
the
malts
arent
strong
but
balance
out
the
citrus
well
this
and
the
light
but
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
make
it
an
easy
drinking
but
really
flavorful
apa
the
hopilicious
is
a
solid
ipa
the
beer
poured
a
clear
orange
with
white
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
scent
carried
fresh
hops
that
leans
towards
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
follows
the
nose
quite
well
it
does
have
a
more
bitter
than
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
could
be
sessioned
this
really
is
a
pinnacle
of
american
ipas
and
i
hope
that
ale
asylumwith
their
spectacular
new
facilitiesare
able
to
expand
their
microbrewed
gem
to
a
larger
crowd
overall
good
drinking
nice
and
hoppy
apa
not
mindblowingly
good
but
a
solid
buy
for
an
everyday
drinking
apa
the
look
and
smell
was
very
appealing
and
the
hops
shine
for
a
pale
ale
it
is
a
good
west

type
pale
ale
o
a
well
done
pale

theyve
found
a
way
to
keep
the
citrus
flavor
of
the
cascade
hops
while
limiting
the
bitterness
the
result
is
a
delicious
hoppy
brew
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
highly
recommended
4
o
really
dig
this
apa
id
get
it
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
i
absolutely
do
not
like
hops
however
i
have
heard
so
much
about
how
awesome
this
beer
is
the
brewery
is
28
miles
away
in
a
college
town
so
i
had
to
try
it
it
actually
has
a
very
smooth
taste
and
has
the
perfect
carbonation
i
still
dont
like
a
hoppy
beer
however
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
taste
and
isnt
all
that
bad
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
that
i
recommend
to
any
citrusy
hop
fan
overall
just
a
superb
pale
that
is
actually
a
pale
and
not
an
ipa
recommended
o
it
is
a
good
beer
and
good
when
viewed
as
an
apa
worth
finding
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
that
uses
cascade
hops
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
d
not
a
bad
beer
despite
being
too
malty
for
my
usual
fancies
i
drank
it
warmer
than
fridge
temperature
probably
would
have
liked
it
better
if
i
had
it
colder
o
bought
a
6pack
of
this
on
our
annual
fall
trip
to
wisconsin
for
apples
i
love
a
lot
of
hopforward
beers
but
this
one
was
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
tastes
still
not
a
bad
beer
overall
i
love
buying
this
by
the
box
of
12
and
ive
been
doing
so
for
years
a
great
allaround
bier
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
a
touch
of
malt
an
absolute
goto
tasty
overly
hopped
pale
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
leans
very
much
to
the
hoppy
side
with
lots
of
citrus
esters
but
doesnt
have
the
bitter
bite
of
an
ipa
a
nice
lighter
hoppy
option
o
a
tasty
ipa
with
loads
of
citrus
hop
flavour
easily
sessioned
and
well
worth
picking
up
i
could
take
down
a
6er
of
this
no
problem
o
the
flavors
arent
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
like
a
dumbeddown
daisy
cutter
a
solid
brew
that
i
could
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
on
a
hot
day
like
today
this
is
a
really
nice
really
drinkable
pale
ale
great
hop
aromas
clean
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
see
more
of
this
in
my
future
overall
happy
with
this
brew
nice
depth
and
good
flavor
will
have
to
try
some
other
products
from
asylum
o
ale
asylum
has
struck
gold
with
hopalicious
a
delicious
and
roundbodied
pale
with
a
great
aroma
and
inviting
appearance
the
flavor
lends
itself
very
well
to
a
richer
hoppy
session
beer
that
has
great
drinkability
it
has
a
nice
yellow
color
toward
brownish
it
has
a
nice
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
they
recently
moved
the
brewery
to
a
larger
facility
and
have
switched
from
the
stubby
bottle
to
long
necks
the
quality
is
still
a1
all
in
all
i
will
base
my
score
off
of
this
beer
i
do
not
review
beer
from
bad
batches
or
that
is
infected
as
it
is
not
fair
to
the
overall
score
overall
of
all
of
the
ale
asylum
beers
that
i
have
tried
ambergeddon
contorter
madtown
satisfaction
jacksin
this
is
my
favorite
light
mellow
feel
extremely
drinkable
with
grassy
green
hop
notes
and
sustained
bitter
orange
peel
in
the
aftertaste
easygoing
malt
character
that
isnt
overly
sweet
thankfully
the
composition
is
seamless
and
its
just
an
effortless
apa
to
drink
definitely
a
gateway
craft
beer
for
those
hopaverse
but
craftcurious
beer
drinkers
out
there
if
this
were
more
carbonated
it
would
change
the
beer
entirely
it
is
a
unique
hope
flavor
definitely
but
unfortunately
thats
all
this
beer
has
going
for
it
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
local
pale
ale
nice
hops
and
citrus
in
the
nose
though
it
wasnt
quite
as
strong
in
the
taste
easy
to
drink
and
would
have
it
again
though
i
enjoyed
some

this
is
a
fantasticly
easy
drinking
apa
its
got
fruity
hops
and
spicy
hops
ohmybock
this
is
a
good
brew
i
am
very
satisfied
with
the
flavor
and
the
balance
as
with
buying
in
a
growler
the
beer
needs
to
be
drank
sooner
rather
than
later
i
feel
i
lost
some
of
the
crispness
this
beer
had
to
offer
waiting
2
days
to
review
after
my
first
pint
di
had
some
of
this
fresh
and
it
was
remarkably
better
after
a
few
months
in
the
fridge
it
got
a
bit
oxidized
with
a
loss
of
hops
needless
to
say
this
a
nice
overall
example
of
a
micro
apa
dale
asylum
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
breweries
in
the
madison
area
and
i
will
buy
this
again
but
not
until
late
spring
when
it
would
better
match
the
climate
the
taste
is
enjoyable
and
the
body
is
not
altogether
lacking
but
between
the
two
there
is
some
imbalance
d
drinks
quite
well
i
had
enough
taste
buds
left
after
this
to
appreciate
either
another
one
or
my
dinner
pours
a
orangeish
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
grapefruity
hops
dominate
anything
else
in
the
taste
a
small
sticky
sweet
grapefruity
hop
small
but
effective
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
grapefruity
hop
aftertaste
nice
bitter
and
hops
easy
to
drink
pours
a
murky
sunset
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
two
finger
head
that
slowly
descends
to
a
frothy
layer
stickiness
is
damn
good
lots
of
lacing
on
the
sides
smell
is
of
fresh
pine
and
the
slightest
bit
of
citrus
some
caramel
malt
and
some
dirty
earthlike
aromas
tickle
the
nose
as
well
pretty
dry
smell
overall
but
not
in
a
bad
way
taste
is
a
slick
pine
flavor
with
some
sweet
malt
as
well
the
sweetness
seems
to
over
power
the
hops
a
bit
aftertaste
is
white
bread
like
with
a
lingering
grassy
flavor
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
i
figured
this
would
be
a
bit
hoppier
by
the
name
but
it
still
doesnt
disappoint
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
ambergeddon
one
of
these
days
pours
a
honeygolden
hue
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
a
eggshell
white
crown
very
few
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
this
beer
and
the
crown
is
slowly
diminishing
the
aroma
is
exquisite
its
soft
yet
strong
with
a
blend
of
floral
and
citrus
and
a
touch
of
malt
underneath
as
i
let
the
beer
warm
up
a
little
the
flavor
becomes
much
more
pronounces
there
is
a
nice
hoppyness
to
this
beer
but
it
fades
a
bit
too
quickly
the
body
is
somewhat
light
and
the
finish
is
dry
mouthfeel
is
less
than
average
and
drinkability
is
also
average
this
was
my
first
ale
asylum
beer
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
flavor
than
i
got
still
a
decent
beer
overall
this
beer
was
a
letdown
i
hesitate
to
use
stronger
language
and
was
just
another
in
a
line
of
beers
trying
to
be
hoppy
for
the
simple
sake
of
being
hoppy
with
nothing
else
to
offer
fellow
ipa
apa
dipa
drinkers
avoid
this
one
if
you
can
some
might
clamor
for
more
malt
assertion
but
thats
not
what
this
is
about
its
like
an
ipalight
juicy
as
hell
but
stripped
of
untoward
bitterness
and
showcasing
boringold
cascades
in
a
new
light
for
those
suffering
burnout
of
said
hop
this
is
a
revitalizer
it
was
for
me
this
brew
is
pretty
darn
good
though
not
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
odd
for
a
pale
ale
i
like
this
much
but
wish
maybe
a
bit
more
balance
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
i
think
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
not
look
for
anything
else
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
that
ive
had
this
beer
should
satisfy
any
hophead
went
and
purchased
a
six
of
bottles
the
next
day
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
good
blast
of
bubbles
goes
down
easy
and
is
quite
refreshing
as
a
good
apa
should
be
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
could
easily
have
a
few
more
a
tasty
cascade
bomb
of
an
apa
that
also
does
a
good
job
of
packing
in
the
hops
without
much
bitterness
maybe
just
needs
a
little
more
in
the
malt
department
though
check
this
one
out
if
you
are
in
the
madison
area
you
need
to
stop
by
ale
asylum
and
sample
this
beer
very
good
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
that
lingering
bitterness
is
not
as
pleasent
as
other
ipas
its
good
but
not
great
this
golden
ale
is
very
solid
though
maybe
a
little
light
colored
for
an
apa
but
has
a
bigclean
head
that
lingers
on
top
hoppy
nose
with
big
citrus
but
a
little
bit
grassy
underneath
light
sweet
body
with
the
ipa
level
hops
i
think
a
real
hop
head
beer
hops
for
me
are
a
bit
overboard
for
the
base
of
the
beer
but
truly
accent
the
hops
and
lives
up
to
the
name
if
it
s
what
you
want
and
lovedrink
up
i
enjoyed
the
three
i
drank
over
the
course
of
my
fantasy
football
draft
d
solid
pale
ale
enjoyable
sweet
toasty
hoppy
and
excellently
drinkable
i
could
be
fond
of
this
glad
i
grabbed
a
6pack
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
nonic
this
was
a
clear
orangecopper
in
color
nutty
flowery
and
citric
in
the
nose
a
hint
of
something
else
as
well
maybe
honeyed
buttered
biscuits
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
taste
is
a
light
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
a
lighter
than
expected
hop
bitterness
light
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
not
sure
about
the
abv
but
it
must
be
in
the
45
range
that
along
with
the
interesting
nose
makes
the
drinkability
just
ok
these
guys
are
new
will
give
them
time
to
work
out
the
kinks
very
fine
mouthfeel
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
that
accentuates
the
malt
that
is
there

mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
mildly
sweet
yeasty
a
bit
tart
of
the
citrus
notes
appearance
is
a
hazy
pineapple
juice
color
with
minimal
head
that
clung
to
the
side
of
my
glass
aroma
was
very
fruity
it
smelled
like
peaches
to
me
taste
was
also
very
fruity
i
got
more
peach
and
apricot
it
was
very
good
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
with
very
fine
carbonation
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
d
too
dry
for
my
tastes
i
think
i
would
have
liked
some
sweetness
to
balance
out
all
the
dryness
i
thought
with
all
the
caramel
in
the
nose
it
would
have
been
a
bit
maltier
this
apa
pours
a
cloudy
golden
in
to
my
mug
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
nicely
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
high
cascade
hops
there
is
absolutely
no
mistaking
what
is
in
the
beer
an
in
your
face
citrusy
cascade
bonanza
any
malt
aroma
is
very
low
maybe
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
through
the
roof
with
hop
flavor
very
fresh
grapefruitlike
citrus
hop
flavor
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
nicely
done
at
a
moderately
to
moderatelyhigh
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
rather
clean
and
as
advertised
strikingly
less
than
what
the
smell
would
lead
on
the
finish
leaves
just
enough
hop
flavor
on
the
palate
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
is
overwhelming
the
carbonation
is
medium
as
is
the
body
and
the
drinkability
despite
the
intensity
of
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
is
rather
high
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
i
think
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
the
hops
are
in
your
face
without
lingering
to
the
point
where
it
is
over
done
the
lower
hop
bitterness
than
one
might
expect
i
think
keeps
the
beer
from
being
out
of
control
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
a
fresh
american
citrusy
hop
flavor
and
aroma
like
opening
a
bag
of
fresh
whole
leaf
flower
cascades
hopalicious
delivers
a
bright
resinous
and
citrusy
hop
nose
the
body
is
a
hazy
goldenamber
beneath
a
creamy
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
patchy
walls
of
spotty
lace
in
its
wake
the
cascade
hops
continue
into
the
flavor
with
resinous
notes
of
citrus
grapefruit
lemon
pineapple
and
pine
over
a
lightly
caramelish
and
just
slighty
biscuity
malt
base
the
bitterness
is
well
balanced
and
it
finishes
dry
and
subtly
acidic
with
some
lingering
notes
of
piney
and
grassy
hops
quite
nice
an
impressive
apa
that
takes
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
of
an
ipa
and
jams
it
into
a
standard
strength
ale
very
west

drinkable

of

lemon
but
not
sweet
at
all
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
not
too
thin
and
goes
down
smoothly
with
some
tingly
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
d
this
beer
has
big
juicy
hops
and
the
ginger
is
a
perfect
amount
to
give
the
hops
a
twist
but
not
being
a
ginger
dominated
beer
whenever
i
am
in
madtown
again
this
will
be
the
first
beer
i
seek
out
drinkability
pretty
good
despite
the
bitterness
a
rather
interesting
and
unique
brew
that
suffers
from
one
deep
flaw

a
complete
lack
of
finish
otherwise
hopalisious
stands
on
its
own
bright
orange
amber
with
a
thin
creamy
white
head
this
brew
looks
just
great
the
aroma
is
strongly
citric
and
obviously
cascade
flavor
is
uniquely
nectarine
skins
subtlety
bitter
without
any
of
the
pine
or
juniper
that
sometimes
comes
with
oodles
of
cascade
hops
this
beer
is
nearly
perfectly
balanced
it
has
immense
citric
flavor
without
more
than
a
slight
bitterness
and
yet
i
am
not
entirely
happy
this
is
because
the
front
offers
a
perfect
medley
of
citrus
while
the
finish
offers
nil
this
beer
dies
after
the
each
sip
and
that
is
simply
unforgivable
in
an
apa
strong
potential
and
otherwise
magnificent
but
still
lacking
any
finish
a
nice
example
of
the
style
id
drink
it
again
this
beer
is
amazing
true
greatness

i
popped
the
cap
and
began
a
very
gentle
pour
as
i
was
simply
unsure
of
what
was
going
to
happen
would
the
hops
have
fallen
off
and
settled
in
the
kick
the
only
was
to
really
know
was
to
initiate
things
there
were
some
lees
becoming
visible
so
i
backed
off
and
left
them
in
the
bottle
i
then
employed
the
bartenders
trick
to
get
a
finger
of
tawny
head
that
quickly
fell
back
to

left

overall
not
bad
but
i
will
accept
the
more
readily
available
sierra
pale
ale
i
was
really
expecting
a
hop
bomb
but
this
is
actually
really
nice
definitely
hoppy
but
surprisingly
restrained
on
the
lingering
bitterness
richer
and
darker
than
a
typical
pale
ale
lovely
velvety
yet
surprisingly
heavy
mouthfeel
and
pours
with
a
foamy
head
that
resembles
softbeaten
egg
whites
in
a
good
way
im
neither
a
pale
ale
nor
hoplover
but
this
is
a
nice
departure
from
typical
apas
o
given
the
quality
of
pale
ales
both
sn
and
fff
make
this
is
a
big
disappointment
an
okay
beer
but
very
unremarkable

b
o
great
beer
cant
wait
to
try
zombie
dust
and
other
3f
originals
uncomplicated
but
well
balanced
light
and
easy
drinking
not
bad
o
an
average
apa
maybe
hey
didmt
pick
my
favorite
malts
but
its
dssapintgm
overall
more
of
an
english
style
than
american
but
pretty
content
with
this
beer
o
this
one
is
okay
honestly
i
like
both
these
guys
individual
pale
ales
better
than
this
one
just
a
bit
underwhelming
o
a
pretty
tasty
solid
american
pale
ale
in
every
respect
although
not
as
hoppy
as
many
had
with
dinner
last
night
i
liked
the
tropical
hopping
but
the
malt
bill
was
a
little
off
pours
a

a

still
very

all
around
medium
body
and
carbonation
yes
i
know
i
should
have
had
this
68
weeks

didnt

nice
piney

along
with
the
signature
sn
clean

definitely
more
malt
than
hop
but
there
was
a
nice
even
bitterness
i
did
not
dislike
my
beer
camp
experience
would
it
have
been
better
6
weeks
ago
probably
it
must
be
a
well
made
brew
if
it
is
still
enjoyable
a
bit
beyond
the
optimal
dates
still
the
first
fff
i
have
seen
around
these
parts
light
refreshing
moutfeel
nailed
the
crispness
etc
i
am
def
going
to
pursue
beer
camp
next
time
around
was
expecting
a
little
more
because
of
the
three
floyds
collaboration
however
the
hops
likely
faded
well
past
their
peak
of
freshness
a
tad
disappointed
because
this
beer
doesnt
exactly
wow
me
but
its
such
a
well
balanced
and
well
brewed
pale
ale
that
if
this
were
a
regular
beer
by
any
other
brewery
it
would
find
itself
in
my
rotation
quite
often
pours
a
clear
copper
color
14

slight

and
slight

and

the

of
an

with

overall
weak

decent

decent

good

good

o
very
nice
pale
ale
a
lot
going
on
o
not
a
big
fan
here
an
unbalanced
apa
with
some
glaring
flaws
one
of
the
weakest
of
the
beer
camp
12
pack
good
beer
has
three
floyds
hop
characteristics
with
sierra
nevada
consistency
not
that
three
floyds
doesnt
also
have
great
consistency
as
a
pale
ale
fan
i
would
keep
this
in
the
fridge
always
if
it
was
available
sn
and
3f
team
up
to
make
a
great
pale
ale
what
a
surprise
oa
decent
beer
but
could
have
been
so
much
better
given
the
breweries
involved
and
the
style
tastecitrus
hops
toasted
malt
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
overall
an
excellence
pale
ale
o
like
another
reviewer
said
this
was
a
combination
of
alpha
king
and
sn
pale
ale
i
longed
for
more
king
and
less
chico
nothing
stellar
just
ok
pours
a
mostly
clear
copper
hue
with
a
quarter
inch
of
head
pine
hop
citrus
alcohol
aroma
taste
is
sub
par
especially
with
the
two
breweries
involved
messy
flavors
do
not
coalesce
odd
and
offputting
next
the
beer
pours
a
significant
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
film
on
top
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
brownish
amber
color
the
beer
smell
has
a
strong
hop
and
malt
notes
the
hops
are
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
has
a
grassy
and
citrusy
and
earthy
note
the
malts
have
a
caramel
note
that
dominates
but
mixes
well
with
the
earthy
hop
notes
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
mixing
with
an
earthy
and
bitter
hop
taste
also
there
is
a
slight
citrus
taste
surrounding
the
bitter
hops
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
but
on
the
heavier
side
overall
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
to
me
this
tastes
like
snpa
and
alpha
king
perhaps
6535
respectively
and
i
love
both
of
those
beers
imo
the
mission
was
carried
out
with
reasonable
success
some
of
the
flavors
arent
quite
as
smooth
as
those
two
but
it
is
quite
good
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
an
american
pale
ale
good
balance
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
presence
a
little
mild
but
very
nice
and
smooth
d
chico
king
tastes
impeccably
like
the
blending
of
sn
pale
ale
and
three
floyds
alpha
king
and
i
must
say
the
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
here
bravo
with
this
one
as
well
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
overall
surprisingly
malty
as
many
others
have
said
for
these
two
powerhouse
breweries
age
is
clearly
a
factor
but
it
is
a
very
forgettable
apa
the
flavor
has
a
nicely
rounded
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
straw
and
some
melon
notes
as
well
as
a
kiss
of
strawberry
on
the
end
finished
dry
leaving
me
wanting
more
o
well
balanced
quite
drinkable
but
not
really
anything
super
special
standard
pale
ale
here
nothing
more
nothing
less
nice
and
drinkable
very
refreshing
but
unfortunately
very
forgettable
no
aspect
of
the
beer
stands
out
at
all
and
if
it
was
a
general
release
there
would
be
nothing
bringing
me
back
to
buy
more
bottle
poured
a
copper
color
ale
with
a
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
citrus
hoppy
notes
with
some
sweet
malty
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
dominated
by
some
citrusy
notes
with
medium
bitterness
and
not
as
much
floral
notes
as
expected
malt
backbone
is
bigger
than
i
had
anticipated
with
some
residual
sugar
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
good
drinkability
but
hops
punch
is
not
as
dominant
as
i
would
have
expected
overall
meh
overall
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
overall
this
was
ok
but
way
too
earth
dry
and
rustic
for
me
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
pale
ale
bordering
on
ipa
by
stats
and
flavor
but
having
more
of
the
sweetness
and
body
i
associate
with
pale
ale
perfect
balance
for
my
palate
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
in
the
past
year
outside
of
toppling
goliaths
pseudo
sue
totally
forgettable
beer
i
expected
more
from
this
collaboration
crisp
and
refreshing
throughout
short
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
beer
solid
but
not
exceptional
apa
this
is
a
solid
american
pale
ale
nothing
really
stands
out
and
that
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
suppose
the
issue
i
have
here
is
that
i
expected
more
from
the
collaboration
i
would
definitely
choose
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
a
3
floyds
alpha
king
over
this
how
could
a
beer
with
such
hop
character
only
have
45
ibus
very
nice
head
tight
foam
with
lace
that
coated
the
entire
glass
on
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
like
most
of
the
other
brews
in
the
years
collection
this
offering
isnt
short
on
malt
bright
and
clear
cleansing
to
the
palate
wishing
i
could
buy
a
case
of
this
fine
brew
pretty
good
but
id
honestly
rather
take
a
regular
sierra
nevada
two
plus
fingers
worth
of
crisp
airy
light
khaki
colored
frothy
goodness
comprised
of
big
chunky
bubbles
excellent
retention
the
top
of
the
froth
turns
a
much
more
rocky
as
it
settles
a
bit
the
color
is
a
medium
bronze
with
a
slight
green
apple
hue
when
back
lit
a
moderate
bit
of
small
bubbled
slightly
quick
paced
carbonation
rises
throughout
a
good
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
overall
a
really
nice
looking
brew
a
rich
warm
bready
biscuit
aroma
some
light
caramel
notes
as
well
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
but
not
much
more
the
palate
is
much
more
of
the
same
a
big
assertive
malty
base
tempered
by
only
a
slight
bit
of
hops
im
a
big
fan
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
big
and
chewy
fills
and
coats
the
mouth
evenly
each
sip
is
enjoyable
overall
this
one
is
a
rock
solid
apa
im
not
12
way
through
the
beer
camp
across
america
collection
and
this
one
is
the
leader
in
the
club
house
at
this
point
a
very
nice
job
by
sierra
nevada
and
three
floyds
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
with
regularity
if
it
were
available
by
itself
year
round
the
taste
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
with
mild
citrus
and
slightly
leafy
quality
mixed
with
a
slight
caramel
taste
from
the
malt
and
light
biscuit
accent
w
mild
dry
bitter
herbal
element
but
not
quite
grassy
with
resinous
aspect
in
the
hoppy
dry
finish
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
pale
but
not
meeting
expectations
either
considering
the
two
breweries
that
collaborated
on
this
it
is
almost
like
a
mild
pliny
nice
but
not
outstandingcould
have
used
more
hop
aromaflavor
decent
but
nowhere
near
what
i
was
hoping
for
aroma
of
cascade
hops
makes
this
smell
like
a
super
version
of
snpa
on
the
surface
along
with
a
touch
of
onionshallot
with
warming
taste
follows
but
is
a
bit
drier
than
expected
and
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
offers
a
full
yet
dry
finish
firmly
carbonated
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
abv
is
well
hidden
even
with
the
dryness
giving
the
beer
a
slightly
chalky
feel
old
school
with
some
new
hops
overall
hard
to
truly
judge
this
3
month
old
bottle
but
it
didnt
hit
our
area
until
it
was
10
months
old
i
dont
pretend
to
know
the
logistical
struggles
with
release
a
variety
pack
with
12
different
bottles
but
i
tend
to
believe
these
hoppy
beers
should
have
been
brewed
closer
to
release
time
3
80
one
of
the
few
beers
i
simply
couldnt
finish
im
assuming
i
had
a
bad
bottle
because
if
not
this
wasnt
good
did
not
like
the
aroma
or
flavor
and
what
favor
it
had
was
very
muted
overall
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
keeps
turning
out
winners
overall
quite
dull
unexciting
and
almost
nonexistent
hop
flavor
just
malty
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
its
not
bad
really
but
its
not
that
good
either
whats
the
deal
with
the
carbonic
mineral
flavor
in
every
single
one
of
these
beer
camp
offerings
this
year
meh
glass
shaker
pint
overall
alpha
king
has
far
superior
aromatics
and
sn
pale
ale
has
a
far
superior
mouthfeel
built
to
survive
the
time
it
was
going
to
take
to
get
this
to
market
i
do
think
it
would
pair
quite
well
with
a
bit
sweet
plate
of
bbq
ribs
but
not
having
fun
drinking
it
on
its
own
would
much
rather
have
one
of
the
two
flagships
this
is
based
on
overall
a
quite
thick
and
hearty
pale
ale
lots
of
malt
in
this
one
with
a
rather
big
flavor
at
only
6
5
abv
not
bad
but
somewhat
over
malty
and
thick
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
shaker
pint
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
grassy
and
citrus
hops
flavor
is
citrus
lightly
piney
hops
with
a
bit
of
resin
caramel
malt
with
some
biscuit
finishes
with
interesting
light
fruit
juice
mixed
with
citrus
hops
and
biscuit
malt
medium
bodied
with
hints
of
creaminess
quite
malty
for
a
pale
ale
and
with
the
moderately
dark
copper
color
more
in
an
amber
ale
territory
hops
are
muted
but
have
a
good
mixture
of
flavors
i
really
liked
the
finish
with
the
combination
of
light
fruit
and
hop
flavors
o
far
from
a
hop
bomb
but
it
is
an
apa
after
all
the
malt
levels
keep
away
any
lingering
bitterness
but
never
gets
anywhere
close
to
being
overly
sweet
quite
mild
actually
definitely
not
what
youd
expect
from
this
collaboration
but
its
still
a
solid
pale
ale
overall
ok
but
not
great
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malt
for
a
pale
hops
are
ok
but
not
great
and
blended
together
are
also
ok
but
not
great
for
a
pale
again
both
great
breweries
and
make
great
beers
but
again
and
again
and
again
collaborations
dont
work
o
a
nice
pale
ale
that
is
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
a
tasty
easydrinkin
pale
ale
i
think
that
this
beer
would
have
been
better
canned
or
served
on
tap
in
order
to
give
the
hop
bouquet
a
boost
pours
like
a
pale
ale
should
with
a
copper
hue
and
a
thin
rising
head
the
aroma
is
rather
plain
but
decent
enough
with
light
pine
tea
leaves
malt
and
some
floral
scents
the
flavor
is
stronger
on
the
barley
malt
notes
light
roasted
nut
then
a
more
hop
finish
of
pine
and
whole
cone
better
than
average
but
below
expectation
from
sn
and
3f
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
classic
pale
ale
with
nice
flavor
but
with
sierra
nevada
and
three
floyds
making
it
i
was
very
excited
and
expected
some
serious
hop
zing
that
would
be
a
cross
between
a
zombie
dust
and
sn
pale
ale
instead
its
more
like
a
bass
ale
sigh
d
so
far
my
least
favorite
from
the
variety
pack
just
muddied
hop
flavor
and
too
much
caramel
in
my
opinion
im
not
sure
why
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
pleasantly
as
most
pale
ales
an
aftertaste
of
spoiled
fruit
with
the
heel
of
dark
loaf
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
the
beer
camp
2014
boxed
set
purchased
in
san
diego
early
august
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
being
that
it
was
a
collaboration
between
the
makers
of
snpa
and
zombie
dust
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hops
blast
slightly
disappointed
that
these
two
breweries
calloborated
and
came
up
short
of
expectations
nothing
bad
or
overly
good
about
this
beer
average
pale
ale
o
typical
sn
ipa
which
is
a
compliment
when
fresh
worth
trying
though
served
in
a
pint
glass
part
of
the
beer
camp
compilation
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
three
floyds
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
amount
of
white
head
has
some
west
coast
hops
on
the
nose
grapefruit
galore
but
still
has
that
sn
malt
backbone
flavor
profile
is
almost
the
same
way
dry
citruspiney
hops
a
nice
malt
profile
solid
mouthfeel
but
here
is
my
problem
with
this
brew
im
a
huge
fff
fan
because
they
hop
the
living
sht
out
of
their
beer
so
when
i
was
fff
i
totally
expected
a
hop
forward
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
high
in
alpha
hops
but
i
would
never
guess
never
ever
that
this
is
a
fff
brew
i
feel
like
sn
is
just
holding
them
down
here
that
being
said
its
a
solid
pale
ale
and
will
hold
me
over
till
my
next
beer
trade
where
i
can
get
some
real
fff
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
for
sure
it
is
a
one
two
punch
of
hops
and
malts
but
always
stays
thoroughly
hoppy
like
a
sierra
nevada
should
raise
it
up
overall
my
least
favorite
beer
camp
so
far
hoppy
unexciting
amber
people
can
be
quick
to
call
pale
ales
an
ipa
however
this
is
a
prime
example
in
my
mind
of
the
true
difference
between
the
two
its
a
wonderful
beer
with
bright
floral
and
fruity
notes
the
balance
between
hops
and
malts
is
very
present
in
this
beer
i
get
strong
notes
of
citrus
and
fruit
with
a
wonderful
flavor
of
fresh
herbs
and
malt
to
round
it
out
this
beer
is
bold
without
a
doubt
but
it
achieves
it
without
throwing
loads
of
hops
in
there
it
adds
wonderful
bright
fruit
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
robust
malts
to
give
it
a
confident
body
i
really
love
this
beer
a
nice
beer
but
one
that
is
such
a
typical
example
of
an
american
ipa
i
know
they
call
it
a
pale
but
cmon
now
that
im
having
a
hard
time
finding
something
to
say
about
it

drink
it
overall
a

but
well
below
my
expectations
given
the
breweries
involved
and
the
description
on
the
label
each
brewery
is
capable
of
producing
better
apas
on
their
own
than
this
particular
offering
off
to
an
unspectacular
start
at

least
favorite
in
beer
camp
series
really
disappointed
that
these
two
great
apa
brewers
did
not
come
up
with
something
better
i
would
rather
drink
a
snpa
or
alpha
king
both
are
better
beers
by
a
mile
way
to
malty
for
an
apa
which
pretty
much
muted
the
hops
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
but
to
be
honest
i
think
both
sierra
nevada
and
three
floyds
both
brew
much
better
pale
ales
then
this
collaboration
o
it
takes
a
similar
track
as
alpha
king
well
balanced
with
a
fat
malt
body
and
an
equally
bold
hop
contribution
its
not
as
captivating
as
alpha
king
but
its
a
good
bigboned
american
pale
ale
o
a
nice
pale
nothing
special
but
certainly
worth
the
drinking
o
overall
i
wouldve
hoped
for
a
bigger
hop
assault
on
a
pale
ale
collab
with
fff
none
the
less
a
tasty
pale
even
though
2
5
months
old
at
this
point
and
these
cases
hit
town
last
week
i
would
expect
the
hop
tohold
on
if
it
was
there
über
fresh
tastes
more
like
a
sierra
nevada
brew
than
a
fff
brew
happy
to
have
tried
but
not
really
that
memorable
for
a
collab
between
these
two
titans
o
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
for
a
pale
ale
and
has
lots
of
flavors
from
the
hops
without
hardly
any
associated
bitterness
the
verdict
very
good
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
very
solid
and
well
balanced
theres
nothing
spectacular
here
but
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
a
good
beer
should
be
not
a
lot
of
love
for
this
one
it
seems
and
off
the
first
sip
i
can
certainly
see
why
the
hop
character
seems
muted
for
whatever
reason
and
a
lot
of
malts
seem
to
show
it
seems
almost
nutty
its
just
a
mix
that
doesnt
work
i
was
hoping
that
the
negativity
that
some
people
were
harboring
towards
beer
camp
and
this
beer
would
end
up
being
misfounded
unfortunately
the
general
consensus
seems
to
fit
the
reality
of
the
situation
really
just
a
masterful
pale
ale
not
sure
why
they
emphasize
these
are
hoppy
breweries
on
the
bottle
and
then
deliver
excellent
balance
but
the
beer
is
great
ofor
an
american
pale
that
clocks
in
at
6
5
from
these
two
apa
master
breweries
i
am
disappointed
i
do
give
some
points
for
going
in
a
direction
nobody
probably
saw
coming
though
overall
pretty
good
id
buy
this
if
it
was
a
permanent
offering
worth
a
try
not
sure
why
the
low
scores
to
be
honest
overall
a
decent
well
crafted
beer
but
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
i
also
picked
up
some
stale
flavors
o
a
very
nice
pale
ale
o
great
for
a
pale
ale
these
are
starting
to
run
together
though
pours
out
a
deep
amber
with
a
thinnish
head
aroma
is
strong
with
toasty
malts
and
citrus
hops
kind
of
a
toast
bomb
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
also
big
on
toastiness
not
into
that
i
pick
up
some
good
caramel
malts
nice
citrus
hops
fruity
esters
the
toast
is
still
a
little
overbearing
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
but
this
is
no
snpa
cant
improve
upon
perfection
nothing
particularly
mind
blowing
but
certainly
a
delicious
beer
for
the
pale
ale
style
overall
not
what
i
expected
but
really
nice
wellbalanced
and
interesting
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
hops
from
the
labels
description
but
its
still
a
damn
good
quaff
o
if
this
were
a
yeararound
or
even
a
seasonal

pop

nothing

looking

most
to
this

this

agood
beer
but
nothing
about
it
is
over
the
top
or
special
its
soild
maybe
because
the

i
picked

this
whole
case
is
recommended
so
far
o
an
alright
beer
overall

nothing
really
stands
out
about
it

are

a

i
found

slow
drinking

for
me
at

very
drinkable
pale

not
all
that
special
nothing
really
stands
out
in
is
character
to
set
it
apart
from
the
masses
of
pale
ales
in
the
market
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
but
i
would
probably
be
thinking
about
what
i
could
have
had
instead
that
would
be
more
enjoyablememorable
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
i
just
like
my
big
hoppy
beers
within
weeks
of
the
package
date
not
months
despite
early
signs
of
aging
effecting
the
beer
its
still
super
well
made
but
nothing
like
any
of
the
hoppy
offerings
from
3fs
including
their
trademark
alpha
king
pale
ale
overall
really
interesting
berry
flavor
will
have
to
see
if
this
is
what
everyone
else
is
getting
too
it
is
subtle
but
interesting
i
like
the
bready
notes
with
the
berry
o
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
nothing
offensive
but
it
doesnt
bring
anything
particularly
interesting
to
the
table
its
neither
snpa
or
alpha
king
but
i
interpret
this
to
be
a
strange
amalgamation
of
the
two
it
works
alright
but
not
in
a
particularly
outstanding
way
o
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
disappointinglackluster
i
had
higher
expectations
for
the
collaboration
between
these
two
excellent
breweries
overall
i
can
see
why
this
is
getting
a
mixed
reaction
as
i
am
sure
many
were
expecting
a
very
hop
forward
pale
ale
it
almost
drinks
like
an
english
pale
ale
light
floral
hops
backed
up
by
rich
nutty
maltiness
overall
i
have
to
be
honest
when
i
saw
that
3
floyds
and
sierra
nevada
were
collaborating
i
was
extremely
excited
this
beer
is
pretty
disappointing
due
to
the
extremely
high
expectations
i
had
it
would
have
undoubtedly
been
better
if
it
were
a
little
fresher
come
on
sierra
nevada
you
should
have
brewed
the
hoppier
collaborations
right
before
packaging
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
that
isnt
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
liked
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
youre
not
missing
much
if
you
give
this
one
a
pass
taste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
but
with
an
unexpected
caramel
malt
foundation
as
well
i
get
a
hint
somehow
too
of
a
ryelike
spice
underneath
it
all
overall
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
one
id
bet
would
be
vastly
different
if
tasted
a
bit
fresher
the
hop
aroma
is
not
really
there
but
the
basic
classic
american
pale
and
hop
angle
hits
the
palate
solidly
not
mindblowing

decent
and
simple
balance

im
left
slightly

by
this
one
on
the
one
hand
its
a
very
good
beer
with
nice
balance
solid
flavors
and
good
presentation
on
the
other
hand
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
modern
pale
ale
in
fact
this
reminds
me
a
good
bit
of
an
amber
or
even
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
not
assertively
hopped
with
a
relatively
mild
flavor
profile
for
the
apa
style
in
short
i
just
dont
think
this
quite
fits
into
the
apa
category
at
least
not
when
you
consider
modern
examples
like
fat
heads
trail
head
or
three
floyds
zombie
dust
a
good
beer
overall
but
as
maltforward
as
it
is
its
more
of
an
antiquated
example
of
the
style
o
a
fine
apa
worth
seeking
out
if
not
quite
as
stellar
or
hoppy
as

the

are
a

very

and
almost
perfectly
suited
for
a
pale
ale
orange
notes
also
predominate
in
the
taste
but
certainly
not
in
an
overpowering
fashion
with
very
subtle

flavors

not

i
call
this

extremely
well
done
if
this
were
a
generally
available
brew
it
would
definitely
be
among
my
go
to
pale
ales
o
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
but
not
the
hop
bomb
i
originally
expected
has
the
maltiness
of

a
way

not

goes

while
it
is
nice
to
see
so
someone
go
against
the
citrus
trend
its
not

the
appearance
is
amazing
but
i
think
it
falls
short
afterwards
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
one
but
unlikely
to
get
another
its
maltydry
finish
is
toasty
and
lightly
modestly
bitter
carrying
the
balance
of
english
bitter
but
with
american
ingredients
we
have
become
accustomed
to
american
pale
ale
having
a
slight
nod
to
the
hops
more
resembling
ipa
however
this
collaboration
remains
malty
quite
unlike
each
brewery
involved
o
decent
brew
i
enjoyed
it
this
was
the
3
floyds
collaboration
but
it
seemed
to
have
more
of
the
characteristics
of
what
i
would
expect
from
a
sn
release
o
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
then
again
most
3
floyds
beers
ive
had
are
curveballs
this
brew
has
a
unique
blend
of
earthy
spicy
and
savory
hops
flavors
paired
with
a
hearty
malt
bill
that
is
reminiscent
of
english
pale
ales
the
hops
were
especially
surprising
and
reminded
me
a
bit
of
what
i
remember
arctic
panzer
wolf
tasting
like
overall
just
meh
i
feel
that
a
sierra
nevadafff
collab
should
have
been
primo
and
this
isnt
12

pours
slightly
cloudy
bright

with

that
reduces
to
a

that
lingers

sweetness
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
a
very
clean
pale
ale
easy
drinking
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
a
very
average
beer
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12pack
served
in
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
and
bready
malt
nuts
and
some
light
earthyherbal
hops
it
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
light
fruitiness
noticeable
to
me
its
more
malty
than
hoppy
maltier
than
i
expect
for
a
pale
ale
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
moderate
carbonation
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
nice
to
try
once
anyway
very
drinkable
beer
but
very
forgettable
as
well
after
the
sip
the
palate
isnt
left
with
much
to
remember
o
not
bad
but
in
terms
of
being
billed
as
a
hoppy
pale
ale
it
didnt
seem
to
follow
up
on
that
promise
a
very
balanced
pale
maybe
a
little
weighed
down
by
the
abv
good
but
not
great
a
have
heard
so
much
about
three
floyds
but
i
will
have
to
say
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
someone
said
an
english
style
pale
ale
thats
about
right
bass
maybe
the
carbonation
on
this
one
was
a
bit
flat
and
there
was
virtually
no
aroma
in
the
smell
more
malt
than
hop
forward
i
have
had
a
few
pale
ales
lately
that
have
done
very
little
for
me
i
can
say
that
this
one
is
right
in
line
maybe
i
just
dont
care
for
this
style
this
was
my
first
one
and
out
of
the
pack
because
i
had
heard
so
much
about
three
floyds
and
i
am
sure
this
is
not
as
representative
as
their
original
stuff
but
this
beer
was
a
solid
alright
it
wasnt
great
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
on
the
the
next
one
o
if
they
billed
this
as
an
english
ipa
i
would
score
it
higher
but
as
a
pale
ale
it
falls
short
the
hop
bill
is
a
little
dates
and
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sweeter
crystal
or
caramel
malt
in
pales
pours
a
more
cloudy
amberhoney
colored
with
finger
width
foamy
head
there
is
a
small
amount
of
head
retention
and
lacing
mild
hoppy
apple
aroma
grassy
hops
hit
you
at
first
taste
you
get
a
heavy
bitterness
followed
by
a
malty
taste
at
the
very
end
there
is
a
nice
touch
to
the
bitter
aftertaste
with
hints
of
apple
it
seems
to
be
a
well
balanced
beer
and
one
i
would
definitely
be
up
to
purchasing
if
it
was
a
full
time
beer
from
sn
o
so
it
did
not
really
meet
expectations
for
a
collaborative
pale
ale
from
perhaps
the
two
breweries
who
make
the
style
best
it
is
refreshing
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
balanced
although
it
might
be
a
little
too
soft
on
the
hops
with
them
really
only
being
prominent
on
the
finish
the
taste
begins
as
it
smells
with
a
good
roasted
malt
presence
and
moderate
sweetness
that
is
displaced
by
the
bitter
hop
bite
at
the
end
the
hops
are
not
floral
they
are
earthy
all
around
so
review
is
subject
to
review
pours
an
amber
hue
with
a
full
head
that
trails
down
the
glass
the
smell
had
a
ton
of
different
fruits
in
the
nose
orange
and
lemon
were
there
but
so
was
banana
and
pineapple
the
taste
was
also
really
nice
with
those
fruit
flavors
mingling
nicely
with
the
toasted
flavor
from
the
malt
overall
it
made
for
an
interesting
pale
ale
with
a
smooth
middle
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
also
nice
light
but
not
too
thin
definitely
a
fan
poured
a
very
nice
deep
cloudy
amber
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
receded
to
a
cap
of
white
leaving
copious
amounts
of
lacing
down
the
glass
a
very
nice
looking
pale
ale
scents
of
yeasty
white
bread
at
first
giving
way
to
tropical
fruit
mostly
light
pineapplelike
aromas
orange
flesh
orange
peel
a
bit
of
overripe
fruit
and
some
pale
malt
in
the
background
the
overall
impression
of
the
aroma
is
light
but
layered
with
fruity
and
malty
aromas
dominating
nice
though
not
as
good
as
expected
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
balanced
hop
bitterness
with
notes
of
pine
resin
toasty
and
sweet
pale
malt
flavors
and
citrus
peel
the
middle
opens
with
more
citrus
peel
flavors
some
floral
and
earthy
hop
notes
hints
of
pine
resin
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
finish
is
mediumdry
with
notes
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
citrus
peel
hints
of
pine
resin
some
floral
and
earthy
hop
flavors
and
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
with
a
very
light
alcohol
presence
a
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
flavor
profile
with
an
abundance
of
fruity
and
resinous
flavors
leaning
more
towards
citrus
peel
and
pine
resin
but
balanced
with
some
faint
floral
and
earthy
flavors
and
a
bit
of
malt
quite
nice
though
a
bit
one
note
overall
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
slightly
slick
feel
quite
easy
to
drink
and
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
that
reminds
me
a
great
deal
of
sierra
nevadas
classic
the
3
floyds
influence
is
hard
to
discern
however
and
overall
it
does
just
feel
like
a
slightly
different
take
on
snpa
its
not
palate
obliterating
like
dreadnaught
but
shit
its
not
meant
to
be
to
me
its
riffing
on
sierra
nevadas
classic
granddaddy
status
especially
considering
the
name
this
is
a
retro
early
80s
pale
ale
that
would
have
blown
any
of
us
away
back
then
yet
another
mediocre
beer
ive
now
gone
through
a
quarter
of
the
box
and
havent
had
a
good
one
yet
another
beer
i
really
liked
from
the
box
although
it
may
not
be
the
most
challenging
style
i
dont
think
that
was
the
intention
with
any
of
these
beers
its
a
very
hoppy
amber
tinted
pine
forward
pale
ale
which
i
could
happily
drink
ten
of
in
a
sitting
and
not
think
twice
about
it
wish
it
was
a
regular
release
for
that
reason
crystal
clear
but
ambery
for
a
pale
ale
some
nice
special
red
malt
in
here
or
something
giving
it
this
glowing
color
bubbles
are
everywhere
fast
paced
but
not
hurried
collecting
into
a
half
inch
of
white
head
pine
and
bitterness
in
the
nose
a
lot
like
sierra
nevadas
normal
pale
ale
in
that
regard
but
its
a
lot
more
vibrantly
hoppy
in
the
taste
where
the
pine
needle
complexion
really
comes
out
i
liked
this
as
it
warmed
too
malt
balance
shows
up
more
readily
and
the
carbonation
never
dissipates
out
of
suspension
which
i
always
appreciate
good
to
the
last
drop
again
not
supposed
to
be
a
real
mind
bender
i
dont
think
its
for
outside
summer
drinking
and
appreciating
without
requiring
any
sort
of
cognitive
dissertation
on
it
for
it
to
be
understood
and
admired
i
hope
to
see
this
one
come
around
again
great
use
of
some
classic
west
coast
hopping
o
what
happened
here
big
dissappointment
for
me
not
the
king
of
alpha
hops
citrus
herbal
hop

prevent
that

much

a
nice
anytime
pale
ale
mild
refreshing
and
not
too
hoppy
great
pale
ale
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
any
day
of
the
year
but
if
you
want
a
strong
hoppy
beer
then
move
on
to
their
torpedo
extra
ipa
the
pale
ales
are
good
but
should
be
reserved
for
those
days
when
you
want
to
switch
it
up
fruity
taste
a
real
session
ale
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
shaker
the
beer
is
a
clear
orange
gold
with
a
decent
amount
of
sediment
floating
around
in
it
and
is
topped
by
a
floating
soapy
white
head
that
has
a
light
retention
and
a
light
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bright
tropical
and
citrus
note
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
a
subtle
bread
toast
undertone
the
taste
is
a
balanced
medium
bittersweet
the
texture
is
oily
with
a
foamy
carbonation
to
help
it
go
down
smooth
the
medium
body
is
flavored
much
like
the
aroma
citrus
pineapple
mango
and
pine
it
finishes
with
a
waxy
bitter
grapefruit
and
pine
that
turns
lightly
cloying
and
astringent
but
mostly
clean
with
an
aftertaste
of
bread
toast
the
first
thing
i
did
on
my
21st
birthday
was
skateboard
down
to
the
store
and
buy
a
12
pack
of
these
sipped
on
them
the
whole
day
these
beers
taste
great
you
have
to
try
them
excellent
full
flavored
beer
very
easy
to
drink
strangely
i
was
disappointed
reviews
are
so
positive
but
alas
not
one
i
would
try
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
was
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
the
craft
scene
theres
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
that
hasnt
been
said
a
million
times
since
its
creation
in
1980
if
for
some
reason
you
havent
tried
this
staple
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
6
pack
pretty
solid
and
tasty
beer
better
a
bit
colder
and
became
less
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
it
was
ok
but
honestly
a
tad
bit
disappointing
after
reading
all
the
reviews
and
having
other
sierra
nevada
beers
dont
see
myself
trying
again
nice
smooth
pale
ale
drink
enjoyed
it
very
much
with
some
italian
food
wasnt
too
overpowering
but
yet
refreshing
definitely
try
it
agian
overall
its
easy
to
see
why
this
beer
is
the
best
selling
pale
ale
in
the
country
its
very
clean
drinkable
and
friendly
to
those
who
are
new
to
hops
if
you
like
this
try
its
big
brother
torpedo
extra
ipa
when
i
let
the
funk
out
it
always
includes
george
clinton
as
far
as
beer
is
concerned
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
right
there
with
gc
right
after
the
pineyester
grapefruitcitrus
forward
taste
and
feel
of
this
brew
youll
be
looking
up
flashlight
on
youtube
drank
my
first
in
the
80s
and
appreciate
it
more
now
readily
available
get
you
some
of
that
soon
there
is
yeast
in
the
bottle
look
hard
at
the
bottom
and
you
will
find
it
impressive
that
they
can
bottle
condition
and
leave
eight
yeast
cells
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
beer
transcends
time
get
ye
some
a
great
hopped
up
copper
beer
fruity
floral
and
flavourful
when
im
in
the
us
i
really
enjoy
this
beverage
perhaps
my
favourite
pale
ale
of
all
time
or
at
this
time
delicious
brew
here
looking
forward
to
throwing
a
couple
of
these
back
come
summertime
pours
two
fingers
of
light
tan
fluffy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
clear
light
amber
and
orange
some
small
particles
floating
around
zesty
spicy
smell
of
pine
floral
background
with
citrus
notes
from
cascade
hops
semisour
citrus
flavors
like
lemon
with
pine
lingering
more
on
finish
bitterness
is
right
about
what
i
would
expect
in
a
pale
straightforward
and
not
too
complex
but
quite
refreshing
good
carbonation
and
stays
on
front
and
middle
of
tongue
for
half
a
minute
or
so
acidity
seems
slightly
off
balance
compared
to
lighter
side
of
a
medium
body
feel
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
foam
expands
and
dances
around
mouth
even
with
a
small
sip
overall
a
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
perhaps
not
the
pinnacle
but
a
highly
recommended
goto
easy
drinking
and
easy
to
find
at
a
good
price
about
1
per
beer
even
in
a
six
pack
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
refreshing
however
for
me
personally
this
is
not
the
beer
id
want
to
consume
everyday
or
in
large
quantities
the
taste
really
subtracts
from
the
drinkability
and
i
really
do
enjoy
drinking
my
beer
whenever
i
think
of
pale
ale
i
think
of
this
great
beer
for
any
occasion
the
gold
standard
for
apa
overall
super
refreshing
beer
one
of
the
best
sessionable
beers
i
have
tried
however
its
obviously
not
as
flavorful
of
a
beer
as
an
ipa
and
feels
a
bit
watery
on
the
palate
this
is
expected
for
the
style
i
would
pair
this
with
a
nice
juicy
slice
of
watermelon
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
gets
a
92
5100
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
theres
basically
nothing
belowaverage
here
or
even
anything
average
for
that
matterwith
the
exception
of
the
sometimesfunky
smell
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
this
one
even
the
smell
isnt
that
much
of
a
downside
which
is
saying
a
lot
considering
just
how
sensitive
i
am
to
bad
smells
as
in
if
something
smells
really
bad
to
me
i
cant
bring
myself
to
eat
it
i
can
see
how
this
was
so
many
peoples
wow
beer
can
taste
like
this
beer
way
back
in
the
day
when
craft
beer
was
a
much
smaller
chunk
of
the
market
than
it
is
today
im
glad
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
fresher
sixpack
of
this
one
after
trying
an
old
one
in
a
restaurant
once
although
i
dont
mind
the
old
version
either
it
is
definitely
better
with
only
2
or
3
months
of
age
on
it
rather
than
10
or
11
xd
excellent
balanced
pale
ale
not
too
this
not
too
that
just
right
my
favorite
pale
ale
pours
a
perfect
amber
colour
with
a
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smell
is
not
overly
strong
hops
with
a
pine
aroma
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
above
average
for
a
west
coast
american
pale
ale
not
over
powering
hops
and
maybe
a
little
citrus
spiciness
to
go
with
it
great
malt
balance
aftertaste
may
be
a
little
grassy
great
mouthfeel
if
you
want
to
introduce
someone
for
the
first
time
to
a
great
apa
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
start
this
is
my
old
friend
very
very
good
go
to
pa
always
taste
good
good
beer
the
first
time
i
tried
it
very
nice
pale
ale
enjoy
this
all
the
time
an
old
classic
always
happy
to
have
this
beer
a
classic
pine
taste
a
goto
beer
that
isnt
boring
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
goes
with
just
about
everything
on
draught
at
the
bier
markt
i
remember
drinking
this
many
years
ago
preba
and
thinking
how
agressive
the
hops
were
it
was
definitely
one
of
the
beers
that
turned
me
towards
the
light
i
think
it
is
a
true
testiment
to
the
craft
beer
world
in
general
that
now
snpa
is
just
a
standard
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
nice
hop
profile
dangerously
sessionable
beautiful
pale
appearance
looks
very
clean
and
clear
small
non
foamy
head
quickly
fades
relative
to
how
great
of
an
ale
this
is
the
smell
isnt
too
huge
pretty
standard
piney
scent
taste
is
up
front
with
hint
of
roasty
malt
but
dominated
by
cascade
hoppiness
refreshing
breadycracker
and
maybe
slight
skunk
finish
but
hardly
detectable
oil
and
resin
mouthfeel
very
spritzy
and
carbonated
which
really
really
works
for
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
the
live
long
day
bottle
of
pale
ale
drank
pours
clear
orange
copper
small
white
head
smells
of
biscuit
cracker
malts
slight
spicy
hops
tastes
malty
on
front
with
warming
hop
bitterness
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
fantastic
finish
obviously
i
have
had
many
snpas
in
the
past
and
in
fact
i
would
say
sierra
nevada
was
my
gateway
into
craft
beer
but
im
just
now
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
myself
sierra
nevada
really
fits
the
bill
setting
the
bar
for
other
apas
with
a
beautiful
lustrous
amber
hue
and
twofinger
bubbly
white
head
the
lacing
sustains
throughout
the
aroma
is
floral
and
citrus
with
the
hops
coming
through
nicely
and
the
taste
is
not
harsh
at
all
just
enough
bitterness
to
tease
the
tongue
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
not
overpowering
ive
always
admired
the
balance
in
this
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
but
present
overall
this
is
a
standard
for
apas
a
really
solid
brew
drank
this
right
after
the
sa
rebel
and
loved
this
even
more
looked
and
smelled
amazing
had
even
more
citrusy
flavors
than
the
previously
mentioned
rebel
i
think
these
end
up
my
gateway
beer
to
loving
all
sorts
of
ipas
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
thick
cap
of
foamy
offwhite
head
amazing
retention
the
aroma
is
light
with
mild
pine
hops
notes
and
hints
of
yeast
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
also
mild
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
with
pine
spice
and
floral
notes
and
a
nice
bready
quality
from
the
malt
bill
there
is
a
solid
carbonation
to
it
and
a
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
as
far
as
big
craft
beers
go
this
is
definitely
not
as
good
as
sam
adams
but
its
fine
and
ill
order
one
in
a
bar
or
restaurant
if
theres
nothing
better
overall
truly
perfect
brewed
to
a
perfection
love
sierra
nevada
i
have
been
enjoying
this
classic
for
over
20
years
and
i
think
it
is
still
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
one
everyone
should
try
it
tastes
kinda
watery
i
didnt
care
for
it
not
bad
but
nothing
special
too
plain
great
everyday
drinking
beer
smell
is
really
floral
but
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
this
beer
will
turn
an
average
drinker
onto
stronger
hoppier
craft
brews
its
an
accesible
staple
apa
wow
a
new
american
classic
if
your
on
here
and
have
not
had
one
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
thin
lacing
ample
carbonation
and
streaky
clinging
lacing
mild
pungent
hop
scent
with
a
grainy
earthy
undertone
dont
sense
much
of
a
citrus
aroma
medium
bodied
feel
carbonation
gives
it
some
bite
some
hop
bitterness
but
also
an
earthy
taste
and
an
occasional
sweet
undertone
a
very
balanced
beer
this
is
the
true
embodiment
of
an
american
pale
ale
i
would
choose
it
over
many
average
ipas
but
not
over
the
better
ones

pretty
with

color
with
a
thick

continuously
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
unfortunately
not
much
in
the
way
of
an
aroma
mostly
just
yeastiness
smells
like
a
lager
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
though
with
nice
piney
and
citrusy
flavors
for
a
cheap
canned
pale
ale
its
always
been
one
of
the
most
accessible
and
cheap
beers
that
actually
tastes
good
the
feel
is
crisp
and
smooth
overall
a
nice
solid
beer
for
anytime
drinking
not
much
fanfare
or
excitement
but
a
solid
drink
12
oz

poured
into
a

almost
no

first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
light
copper
color
she
looks
beautiful
as
the
slight
carbonation
bubbles
to
the
top
as
with
some
of
the
lighter
pale
ales
its
a
little
difficult
to
pick
up
a
smell
at
first
eventually
you
can
pick
up
the
citrusy
yeast
smell
though
its
rather
light
its
got
great
drinkability
and
at
7

is
a
great
value

another

i
would
picking
this
one
up
if
you
havent
already
sierra
nevada
is
pretty
much
the
original
microbrew
and
the
pale
ale
has
earned
itself
as
a
staple
in
their
lineup
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
for
hop
lovers
as
it
has
enough
hops
to
satisfy
ipa
fans
but
with
a
lower
alcohol
content
so
you
can
drink
these
all
day
world
class
well
not
in

world
look
honey

very

by

very

overall
it
was
ok
the
standard
by
which
all
others
are
judged
i
try
and
seek
this
one
out
in
the
sn
variety
packs
to
ensure
i
get
it
fresh
excellent
example
of
what
an
american
pale

should
be

enjoy
the
mild

great

in

this
is
an
artful
example
of
how
the
sum
of
a
beers
parts
can
be
much
greater
than
the
whole
or
in
this
case
the
whole
cone

this
one
is
easy
to
quaff
and
entices
you
to
take
the
next
sip
they
dont
call
it
a
stylistic
standard
because
its
ordinary
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
overall
what
a
great
fantastic
awesome
american
pale
ale
so
beautifully
balanced
and
so
delicious
definitely
my
go
to
pale
ale
when
a
wider
selection
of
craft
beers
is
limited
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
perfect
balance
of
citrus
fruits
pine
and
earthy
flavor
with
just
the
right
bite
probably
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
great
taste
nice
bite
to
it
and
smoother
than
other
pale
ales
ive
had
this
is
the
type
of
beer
other
pale
ales
should
strive
to
be
so
im
definitely
not
a
apa
aficionado
but
as
far
as
they
go
this
pioneer
of
the
style
is
good
slightly
cloudy
caramel
color
almost
no
head
theres
a
hint
of
a
smoky
aroma
like
most
pale
ales
starts
with
a
citrusy
flavor
which
gives
way
to
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
kind
of
a
woody
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
great
beer
not
sure
how
else
to
rate
my
favorite
beer
my
go
to
beer
in
a
pinch
balanced
with
nice
hop
aroma
balanced
crisp
brew
solid
taste
clean
crisp
delicious
pale
ale
there
are
some
better
but
for
price
complexity
and
pure
deliciousness
this
is
a
great
go
to
ale
its
moderate
abv
makes
it
fairly
sessionable
so
this
is
great
at
parties
and
other
gatherings
a
very
nice
very
clean
beer
no
off
flavors
nice
and
simple
without
any
bling
hop
flavor
slightly
more
than
other
pale
ales
ive
had
very
smooth
overall
a
sweetbitter
pale
ale
with
great
balance
a
benchmark
for
the
style
clear
and
right
to
the
point
a
nicely
done
pale
ale
just
bitter
enough
and
trends
more
toward
the
traditional
ipa
profile
great
drinkability
and
a
california
standard
balanced
tasty
o

this
is
a
beer
you
could
transition
someone
from
bmc
to
craft
with
it
has
a
mild
taste
but
is
slightly
more
complex
with
a
little
more
bitter
bite
than
a
standard
aal
most
of
the
sierra
nevada
stuff
i
try
i
really
love
this
i
only
like
i
just
feel
the
beer
is
too
neutral
no
risks
no
malty
backbone
barely
above
bmc
average
beer
ok
taste
wouldnt
buy
again
need
to
buy
more
often
great
beer
o
would
definitely
drink
again
this
may
be
my
new
go
to
ipa
on
tap
at
a
local
spot
i
usually
really
like
pale
ales
but
this
one
just
didnt
seem
to
hit
the
mark
with
me
had
great
smell
but
the
taste
seemed
to
fall
short
maybe
its
just
an
old
keg
maybe
it
was
too
cold
im
not
sure
i
just
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
not
much
to
say
about
this
that
hasnt
been
said
this
is
a
timeless
classic
super
well
rounded
clean
finish
and
the
sierra
nevada
hoppy
twist
that
is
to
be
expected
from
them
always
has
a
place
in
my
fridge
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
tears
it
always
satisfies
still
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
the
most
consistent
and
consistently
available
pale
ale
around
a
solid
brew
ive
been
going
to
for
a
long
time
light
clear
golden
amber
substantial
lace
aromas
of
malt
and
biscuit
and
a
wee
hint
of
citrus
citrusy
hops
are
the
first
flavor
out
of
the
gate
followed
by
a
mediumbodied
biscuity
malty
foundation
mixed
with
wellplaced
hoppy
bitterness
which
gets
handed
the
reins
holds
them
for
a
remarkably
long
time
after
the
swallow
o
i
totally
understand
the
hype
its
a
solid
refreshing
brew
there
are
some
that
turn
their
noses
up
but
i
think
its
grand
very
drinkable
which
is
a
good
thing
sometimes
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
that
ive
had
extremely
tasty
and
fragrant
i
am
fortunate
to
have
had
this
one
on
tap
unfortunately
sierra
nevada
doesnt
distribute
to
new
brunswick
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
can
access
it
light
hoppy
taste
smooth
and
good
flavor
id
drink
it
again
v
good
value
not
enough
taste
or
feel
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
with
the
citrus
flavors
great
beer
to
enjoy

in
the
rather
long
after
taste
amber
in
color
citrus
smell
and
taste
a
good
beer
for
its
availability
not
my
favorite
but
an
excellent
always
available
brew
excellent
pale
ale
a
regular
in
the
kegerator
refreshing
and
not
overly
hoppy
all
around
great
brew
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
this
is
the
hop
heads
equivalent
of
bud
light
an
everyday
beer
bursting
with
flavor
and
quality
extremely
accessible
my
go

beer
wonderful
for
all
occasions
overall
great
go
to
apa
crisp
dry
and
moderately
bitter
grains
pine
and
citrus
hop
character
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
crisp
dry
and
moderately
bitter
grains
pine
and
floral
hop
character
a
true
classic
after
i
tasted
this
i
went
back
and
got
a
case
of
this
bitter
foul
and
completely
unrewarding
this
beer
sets
the
standard
overall
hard
to
be
impartial
here
ive
been
drinking
this
as
a
standby
for
over
20
years
along
with
summit
epa
and
great
northern
porter
though
pales
and
ipas
have
come
a
long
long
way
this
is
still
so
enjoyable
sn
pale
ale
is
an
icon
for
good
reason
when
it
comes
to
apas
its
my
go
to
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
beers
to
cook
with
the
only
reason
i
dont
rank
this
higher
is
because
sometimes
ill
get
a
particularly
bitter
one
but
ive
had
enough
outstanding
ones
to
know
that
this
is
a
really
good
beer
this
is
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
craft
beers
it
has
a
great
amber
color
for
the
pale
ale
style
of
brewing
an
inviting
floral
citrus
aroma
and
an
upfront
hoppiness
that
fades
at
just
the
right
time
to
a
malty
backbone
leaving
a
great
balanced
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
with
a
moderately
creamy
mouth
feel
all
in
all
a
great
beer
one
that
i
would
buy
again
anytime
not
to
mention
that
this
beer
is
a
classic
in
the
craft
beer
industry
and
certainly
brought
more
awareness
to
craft
brewing
in
the
nineties
o
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
one
word
it
would
be
inoffensive
which
makes
it
i
suppose
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
not
as
hop
forward
as
an
ipa
which
is
the
point
i
always
say
this
is
my
least
favorite
sierra
nevada
beer
but
despite
that

the

one
of
the
first
crafts
i
recall
consuming
along
with
torpedo
and
boston
lager
i
dont
drink
this
nearly
as
much
since
my

has
developed

very
lush
and
full
now
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
fantastic
chilled
and
still
pretty
darn
delicious
at
room
temp
or
warmer
so
take
one
to
the
river
and
enjoygabrielvaughnmay

id
prefer
it
just
s
smidgen
lighter
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
a
refreshing
blend
of
subtler
west
coast
hops
and
light
caramel
malts
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
almost
as
distinctive
as
the
nose
there
is
a
reason
that
this
has
been
one
of
the
most
popular
and
benchmark
ales
in
the
realm
of
craft
beers
its
a
good
and
consistent
apa
worth
trying
and
respecting

the

you
all
expect

this

just

me
this
beer
is
my
new

i
just
had
one
bottle
from
a
sample
case
of
many
that
i
received
for
my
birthday
and
damn
i
just
found
my
new
favorite
my
old
favorite
was
newcastle
but
now
i
think
i
found
my
true
love
i
havent
checked
the
price
of
this
beer

this
remains

overall
this
is
a
classic
pale
ale
that
still
holds
up
today
readily
available
and
affordable
and
quite
easy
to
drink
always
a
solid
choice
to
have
on
hand
o
such
a
great
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
neither
the
super
hopbomb
american
ipadipa
nor
the
maltshake
english
pale
ale
its
really
the
best
of
both
worlds
achieving
a
balance
i
wish
more
american
pale
ales
went
for
its
in
my
top
10
of
goto
beers
when
in
doubt
this
one
is
guaranteed
to
hit
the
spot
everytime
and
that
in
itself
deserves
a
5
across
the
board
and
yes
it
is
that
damn
good
the
classic
and
still
a
champion
30
years
later
this
one
never
gets
tiring
overall
this
is
my
first
review
here
overall
its
a
great
beer
has
a
nice
bite
i
personally
like
maltier
brews
and
had
to
give
this
a
few
tries
before
really
appreciating
it
right
now
im
thinking
of
having
a
second
one
plan
on
having
some
other
pale
ales
so
i
can
compare
o
there
are
others
out
there
with
more
craftsmanship
and
more
interesting
offerings
too
for
a
beer
than
can
be
had
so
readily
its
still
a
great
one
very
sessionable
brew
fairly
balanced
but
leans
slightly
toward
the
bitterhoppy
side
b
just
the
right
amount
of
lacing
and
the
right
amount
of
head
the
color
is
a
perfect
golden
color
with
little
carbonation
lingering
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
subtle
not
too
strong
not
too
weakjust
right
surpassed
only
by
deschutes
mirror
pond
pale
ale
sierra
nevadas
offering
is
still
the
benchmark
of
what
a
great
pale
ale
is
the
epitome
of
balance
and
nuance
drastically
simple
and
overwhelmingly
pure
sierra
nevadas
use
of
whole
hop
leaf
allows
all
of
the
flavors
and
aroma
to
shine
through
highlighting
the
best
part
of
a
good
beer
the
sublime
hop
flavor
which
this
beer
has
plenty
of
delicious
and
a
great
anytime
beer
my
favorite
pale
ale
hands
down
no
other
like
it
overall
its
solid
maybe
not
the
best
but
solid
serving
type
bottlepint
glass
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
off
white
head
which
dissipated
surprisingly
quickly
and
had
only
some
lacing
appearance
was
a
light
amber
with
a
slight
haze
aroma
was
light
and
of
malt
and
grain
taste
had
hints
of
caramel
grain
and
a
sweetness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
full
and
nice
with
a
clean
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
absolutely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
honestly
can
go
good
with
anything
but
you
are
better
off
enjoying
this
beer
by
itself
it
has
so
much
too
offer
such
great
combination
between
the
yeast
and
malts
making
this
an
outstanding
brew
you
can
put
this
on
my
list
of
top
beers
overallfor
a
beer
that
everyone
can
get
just
about
anywhere
this
is
a
no
brainer
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
still
lives
up
to
what
it
was
10
years
ago
price
is
among
the
cheapest
for
any
craft
offering
if
you
have
few
options
in
beer
this
is
the
one
to
get
4
25
o
the
touchtstone
of
the
apa
style
and
an
ideal
gateway
beer
into
the
craft
brew
world
o
very
very
good
sierra
nevada
is
a
staple
in
the
beer
world
i
believe
this
was
the
first
apa
i
ever
had
it
maintains
high
status
whenever
unsure
a
sierra
nevada
brew
will
not
steer
you
wrong
one
of
my
favorite
pas
something
i
always
keep
on
stock
and
this
is
enjoyed
by
everybody
ive
had
sierra
nevada
pale
out
of
the
bottle
and
on
draft
plenty
but
from
a
can
and
poured
into
a
glass
is
phenomenal
even
straight
from
the
can
is
great
everything
about
this
experience
is
fantastic
from
the
lacing
on
the
glass
to
the
creamier
fuller
bodied
mouthful
this
summer
i
will
be
drinking
plenty
of
this
this
beer
is
what
i
compare
all
other
pale
ales
by
a
great
blend
of
flavors
and
qualities
makes
it
one
of
the
best
an
extremely
obnoxious
brew
way
overpowered
on
flavor
and
alcohol
content
the
alcohol
content
alone
will
give
this
brew
many
tall
reviews
but
if
your
looking
for
drinkability
this
is
not
your
beer
this
is
definitely
an
aquired
taste
hair
on
the
chest
types
haha
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
pale
ale
guy
but
i
do
enjoy
them
from
time
to
time
this
one
was
just
not
doing
it
for
me
when
i
wanted
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
will
most
likely
revisit
this
one
as
it
is
not
hard
to
come
by
but
until
then
these
are
my
thoughts
on
it
o
a
really
good
beer
right
on
par
with
most
of
sns
offerings
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
for
me
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
strong
but
it
was
not
overpowering
i
would
recommend
this
its
fairly
drinkable
and
would
be
a
good
every
day
beer
im
not
usually
a
pale
ale
fan
but
this
was
sone
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
very
floral
aroma
and
light
citrusy
appearance
the
smell
was
floral
and
citrusy
there
was
a
strong
lemon
flavor
at
first
but
the
finish
is
earthy
and
reminiscent
of
a
freshly
laid
bed
of
pine
straw
it
has
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
smooth
id
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
with
some
spicy
indian
food
overall
a
very
nice
ale
bitterness
is
present
in
a
light
style
refreshing
beer
too
o
this
is
a
very
worthwhile
beer
an
everyday
kind
of
brew
that
isnt
that
way
because
its
easy
to
drink
some
big
and
bold
flavors
are
here
it
just
doesnt
have
the
best
balance
this
is
my
go
to
beer
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
about
two
fingers
worth
on
head
on
it
has
a
great
hop
and
floral
smell
to
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
nice
lacing
taste
of
hops
citrus
and
floral
notes
has
a
nice
dry
finish
to
it
all
in
all
just
a
great
beer
this
pours
a
tan
golden
color
with
light
foam
aroma
has
orange
and
orange
zest
in
waves
atop
of
it
the
flavor
is
lightly
piney
and
citrusy
and
finishes
dry
an
easy
drinker
and
a
delicious
one
at
that
pours
a
golden
honey
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
nice
and
bready
paired
with
some
nice
citric
and
just
a
touch
of
some
floral
flavor
followed
suit
with
a
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
medium
body
active
overall
a
solid
brew
not
ever
a
beer
i
seek
but
a
beer
that
is
perfectly
enjoyable
when
i
do
drink
o
a
classic
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
and
my
go
to
every
day
drinker
when
a
12
pack
cost
13
nothing
over
the
top
but
a
great
beer
non
the
less
hot
damn
now
thats
an
american
pale
ale
thanks
to
my
buddy
colin
for
presenting
this
awesome
beer
on
a
craft
beer
tasting
night
at
his
house
normally
we
cannot
get
this
beer
in
alberta
but
due
to
the
fact
that
vancouver
hosted
the
olympics
in
2010
and
sierra
nevada
was
a
sponsor
of
their
alpine
ski
team
he
was
able
to
pick
up
a
bottle
from
a
liquor
store
in
bc
it
poured
a
nice
ruby
with
immediate
hop
aroma
but
underlying
and
very
pleasant
caramel
malt
the
lacing
could
not
have
been
better
and
it
just
tasted
awesome
i
immediately
understood
why
sierra
nevada
is
considered
one
of
the
worlds
best
beer
producers
and
at
the
forefront
of
the
craft
beer
movement
if
beers
like
this
could
catch
on
to
the
mainstream
we
would
never
see
budweiser
in
another
bar
unless
it
was
the
original
czech
pilsner
othis
is
a
good
bear
no
matter
how
many
times
i
try
it
the
hops
are
aggressive
but
balanced
enough
to
keep
this
from
becoming
onedimensional
in
terms
of
taste
per
availability
unit
if
there
is
such
a
thing
or
taste
per
dollar
there
are
not
many
beers
out
there
that
top
this
one
faults
are
minor
and
include
a
slightly
off
appearance
and
underwhelming
mouthfeel
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
3
55
this
may
be
the
best
non
bmc
beer
that
is
just
about
universally
available
it
pours
up
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
not
much
retention
and
lots
of
sticky
delicate
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
pine
resin
and
citrus
taste
follows
the
nose
there
is
a
nice
grapefruitiness
follwed
by
a
spicy
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
love
this
stuff
overall
a
great
goto
beer
that
i
drink
occasionally
its
available
everywhere
and
i
use
it
to
woo
bmc
drinkers
into
the
craft
world
sometimes
i
havent
found
a
sierra
nevada
product
i
wasnt
fond
of
yet
and
this
is
their
bread
and
butter
beer
if
you
have
not
tried
it
get
some
o
a
solid
american
style
pale
ale
that
is
widely
available
drink
on
the
colder
side
and
this
is
a
wonderfully
refreshing
beer
regardless
of
it
all
i
gave
it
an
above
average
rating
because
it
was
quite
enjoyable
and
goes
well
with
many
foods
this
beer
is
a
very
slightly
hazed
orange
color
with
a
a
large
off
white
head
the
beer
itself
is
quite
hop
forward
for
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
very
light
malt
character
of
breaddy
notes
and
sugar
the
hops
are
the
main
attraction
fresh
citrus
fruits
pineapple
mango
oranges
there
is
also
a
nice
bit
of
pine
a
very
sharp
and
crisp
hop
character
the
amount
of
hop
flavor
considering
the
bitterness
is
impressive
a
medium
bodied
beer
a
world
class
pale
ale
considering
the
price
and
availability
of
this
beer
noting
really
comes
close
overall
i
was
going
to
bash
the
guy
below
for
giving
this
a
lower
score
but
its
kind
of
true
its
a
beginner
ipa
that
plays
off
like
a
pale
ale
damn
tasty
regardless
smell
and
taste
of
water
and
hops
i
like
it
nice
and
bitter
probley
one
of
the
most
consistant
pale
ales
around
very
good
and
drinkable
even
for
beginers
it
is
close
to
a
lager
with
hopier
traits
a
nice
beer
that
is
enexpensive
and
to
watch
a
football
game
with
not
so
heavy
just
smooth
and
good
o
i
usually
dink
more
malty
beers
so
im
not
well
acquainted
with
this
style
yet
overall
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
overall
a
tasty
and
balanced
pale
ale
a
good
easy
drinker
o
this
is
just
a
great
example
of
the
pale
ale
style
theres
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
but
its
just
the
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
fact
that
its
so
cheap
and
widely
available
definitely
adds
points
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
thats
available
everywhere
overall
just
one
outstanding
beer
this
is
certainly
a
goto
apa
when
youre
looking
for
something
to
sit
back
relax
and
drink
a
bunch
of
you
can
certainly
toss
these
back
all
day
great
drinkability
tons
of
flavor
also
a
great
beer
for
introducing
people
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
namely
hopforward
beers
as
it
has
a
large
hop
presence
but
is
relatively
mild
and
far
from
overpowering
especially
to
a
new
palate
this
is
apa
done
simple
and
done
right
this
is
an
average
pale
ale
not
bad
just
average
the
mix
of
flavors
that
i
am
used
to
smelling
and
tasting
with
this
style
are
not
present
it
is
a
well
put
together
brew
but
i
believe
sierra
nevada
could
do
better
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
decent
head
and
light
lacing
the
nose
carries
citrus
and
resinous
pine
it
has
a
mediumlight
mouthfeel
the
palate
is
first
hit
by
citrus
and
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
and
that
bottle
conditioned
yeastiness
that
i
have
come
to
love
from
sierra
nevada
as
you
drink
it
the
flavors
develop
more
and
more
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
was
far
from
dissapointed
a
fantastic
beer
perfect
yet
unassuming
like
a
fender
stratocaster
refreshing
and
boldflavored
highly
recommended
would
rate
this
as
a
very
well
brewed
transition
beer
that
would
be
suitable
for
those
overwhelmed
by
other
craft
apas
medium
body
and
carbonation
good
smoothness
in
the
draft
version
an
excellent
choice
on
a
night
trapped
in
a
shitkickin
bmc
bar
thankful
for
this
option
doesnt
fire
up
the
imagination
and
palate
the
way
it
did
20
odd
years
ago
but
still
a
reliable
and
satisfying
drinker
o
i
will
drink
this
beer
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
well
not
really
but
i
now
know
when
i
want
something
that
is
not
too
heavy
or
too
punchy
with
flavor
this
beer
will
do
the
trick
very
tasty
refreshing
overall
refreshing
summer
beer
great
citrus
hops
balanced
o
i
absolutely
live
this
beer
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
truly
amazing
a
classic
craft
beer
o
the
pine
definitely
overwhelmed
all
of
the
other
flavros
but
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
an
outstanding
pale
ale
in
the
crowded
pale
ale
style
snpa
stands
out
o
its
described
as
a
classic
for
a
reason
great
beer
for
a
ridiculously
great
price
if
you
want
to
start
someone
into
craft
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
to
try
could
easily
go
be
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
superb
this
pale
ale
well
deserves
the
praise
that
it
receives
plenty
of
flavour
yet
so
drinkable
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
it
errs
on
the
sweet
side
yet
this
is
offset
by
bittering
hops
and
fruityresinous
aroma
hard
to
fault
really
a
brilliant
beer
add
this
to
your
musttry
list
final
thoughts
no
complaints
here
a
standard
in
apas
would
i
drink
it
again
most
likely
although
i
rarely
seek
out
apas
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
have
in
any
fridge
the
balance
of
the
hops
and
malt
is
right
on
the
flavours
are
very
unique
and
well
designed
i
love
this
beer
and
should
be
visiting
it
more
often
than
i
do
this
is
the
one
single
beer
that
got
me
into
better
beer
its
an
all
time
classic
that
i
will
continue
to
spring
for
overall
this
is
the
apa
i
use
as
a
yardstick
to
measure
all
others
snpa
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
and
this
sample
did
not
disappoint
i
liked
this
beer
had
it
with
a
cheese
steak
sandwich
and
it
really
went
well
with
it
i
will
buy
some
and
keep
in
the
fridge
wow
decent
beer
in
a
can
price
goes
down
value
goes
up
takes
up
less
space
and
is
lighter
to
carry
i
thought
i
would
hate
good
beer
in
a
can
but
since
pale
ale
has
always
been
a
go
to
decent
beer
for
any
occasion
its
fitting
that
its
now
available
in
a
can
and
yes
im
drinking
it
straight
from
the
can
there
is
something
about
the
hole
in
a
can
that
aerates
the
beer
and
gives
it
a
novel
texture
and
taste
which
i
must
admit
i
enjoy
as
long
as
these
stay
a
good
bit
cheaper
than
the
bottled
pale
ale
i
think
i
will
buy
these
many
times
over
no
need
reviewing
the
flavor
of
one
of
americas
most
common
craft
ales
o
basically
and
excellent
light
pale
ale
for
those
who
arent
really
into
hardcore
overbearing
ipas
that
dominate
the
top
beers
lists
on
this
site
grab
one
or
6
o
its
hard
to
be
objective
at
this
point
having
had
it
so
many
times
and
having
tasted
this
exact
same
flavor
profile
in
every
sierra
nevada
brew
that
being
said
theres
a
reason
that
its
a
classic
it
brings
big
flavors
but
keeps
them
balanced
the
hops
are
tasty
and
it
goes
down
smooth
o
a
refreshing
malty
and
citrusy
beer
nothing
overboard
or
special
but
you
cant
go
wrong
for
an
apa
a
great
drink
for
any
occasion
comments
i
think
this
is
a
great
american
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
i
first
had
this
back
in
the
early
90s
and
ill
give
credit
to
it
for
getting
me
started
and
hooked
on
craft
beer
still
a
solid
beer
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
beers
at
the
store
down
the
street
a
great
tailgate
brew
but
an
average
pale
its
nice
but
way
over
produced
you
cant
taste
any
love
its
a
goto
when
theres
nothing
else
i
love
the
mouthfeel
i
love
how
english
malt
feels
honestly
its
so
slick
and
drinkable
yet
still
hoppy
enough
to
fill
a
hop
fix
on
a
budget
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
an
orangecopper
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
sparse
white
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
citrus
sweet
and
herbal
spicing
on
a
roasty
caramel
backbone
the
beer
is
smooth
and
crisp
in
mouth
thanks
to
the
carbonation
and
the
hops
bitterness
flavors
are
roasted
caramel
and
a
touch
of
smoke
in
the
backbone
supporting
a
resiny
bitter
hops
profile
that
highlights
alongside
a
citrus
blend
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
very
well
balanced
with
a
bitter
slightly
drying
aftertaste
that
again
showcases
some
of
the
herbal
highlights
smooth
drying
finish
with
some
of
the
bitter
and
spice
left
to
linger
until
the
next
sip
as
i
said
of
the
former
draught
style
this
brew
is
a
staple
of
the
apa
style
very
tasty
and
very
sessionable
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
the
bottle
says
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
a
completely
natural
ale
there
are
no
additives
only
the
finest
malted
barley
whole
hops
brewers
yeast
and
crystalclear
water
the
fine
layer
of
yeast
in
each
bottle
is
a
result
of
the
traditional
bottleconditioning
process
that
produces
carbonation
naturally
overall
a
good
quality
american
pale
ale
that
is
only
let
down
by
its
lack
of
body
good
for
a
6pack
but
i
dont
think
it
will
be
joining
my
list
of
regular
beers
a
classic
american
pale
ale
and
one
of
my
standards
still
better
than
many
of
the
new
to
market
american
pale
ales
solid
in
appearance
nose
and
taste
one
of
the
best
gateway
beers
for
those
trying
to
get
off
of
bland
and
boring
adjunct
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
a
trusted
outstanding
ale
that
i
can
find
nearly
anywhere
in
the
country
and
never
leaves
me
wishing
i
had
chosen
something
else
paired
today
with
a
sharp
cheddar
and
more
muted
farmers
cheese
you
just
cant
go
wrong
with
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
overall
this
is
undoubtedly
worth
every
bit
of
praise
it
gets
if
i
had
the
choice
between
this
and
their
torpedo
though
id
probably
go
with
the
torpedo
this
is
probably
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
be
warned
though
if
youre
used
to
your
pale
ales
being
meh
and
uninteresting
youll
be
surprised
when
you
take
a
sip
of
this
o
if
you
ever
want
to
have
a
big
party
with
good
quality
beer
for
a
great
price
this
is
it
it
is
a
very
delicious
beer
that
i
would
like
to
see
in
my
fridge
often
snpa
is
nothing
out
of
this
world
it
is
simply
a
very
good
beer
however
in
terms
of
availability
price
and
sessionability
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
pleasantly
hoppy
malt
and
hops
are
wellbalanced
in
this
offering
the
finish
is
dry
and
mildly
bitter
the
quintessential
west
coast
pale
ale
a
classic
that
is
always
a
solid
if
not
extraordinary
choice
i
first
tried
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
but
it
was
skunked
in
fact
i
had
a
string
of
skunked
sn
brews
last
week
i
bought
it
again
deciding
to
give
it
another
chance
saturday
i
drank
3
of
them
and
though
it
wasnt
skunked
i
wasnt
impressed
an
off
bitterness
and
not
much
else
perhaps
my
taste
was
off
because
tonight
i
finally
see
what
everyone
is
talking
about
a
wellrounded
fullflavored
brew
a
greatt
summer
ale
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
o
this
is
of
course
a
classic
and
a
staple
pale
ale
its
reputation
is
very
much
wellearned
as
its
a
delicious
hoppy
refreshing
beer
thats
pretty
much
perfect
as
an
everyday
pleasure
just
the
crack
seemed
to
release
a
lot
of
hops
aroma
into
the
room
the
inverted
glug
really
made
it
seem
as
though
i
had
sprayed
hops
air
freshener
and
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
that
my
mouth
was
not
watering
i
was
looking
at
a
massive
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
french
vanillacolored
head
with
excellent
retention
when
i
was
done
with
my
pour
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
full
of
pine
hops
and
now
i
was
starting
to
drool
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
slightly
viscous
and
the
hops
were
soft
not
overpowering
as
in
some
many
aipas
the
melding
of
the
hops
with
the
malt
was
very
pleasant
and
caused
me
to
think
back
to
the
mid1980s
when
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
i
remember
thinking
that
it
was
too
bitter
but
now
it
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
this
jonesin
hophead
finish
was
semidry
and
both
pleasant
and
refreshing
i
am
so
excited
to
see
it
being
canned
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
anyones
cooler
under
any
circumstances
believe
the
hype
poured
from
22oz
bottle
golden
color
with
finger
of
off
white
head
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
citrus
and
grass
hop
aroma
taste
is
sweet
grapefruit
at
first
slightly
thin
and
watery
feel
then
turns
a
bit
dry
and
bitter
lemon
peel
flavor
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
tasty
pale
ale
oa
nice
solid
pale
ale
with
great
flavor
and
balance
wide
availability
makes
this
a
nice
standard
ale
i
drink
it
with
steamer
clams
and
sauteed
oysters
heaven
next
will
be
sauteed
scallops
i
need
54
more
characters
to
post
so
takes
notes
from
the
original
english
pale
but
quite
american
with
a
tad
more
bright
crisp
citrus
and
a
bit
more
mild
toasty
grain
i
dont
think
it
gets
better
per
dollar
in
the
us
snpa
is
the
gateway
you
could
make
the
argument
that
this
is
a
borderline
ipa
in
terms
of
stylistic
components
its
not
quite
a
simple
pale
ale
pounder
and
not
quite
an
ipa
sipper
but
its
a
little
of
both
o
the
beer
that
started
it
all
i
got
away
from
it
for
many
years
and
this
reminds
me
why
good
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
flavor
im
looking
for
to
each
their
own
a
great
gateway
brew
for
any
novice
craft
beer
drinker
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
point
to
this
as
an
intro
craft
beer
it
has
lots
of
the
elements
of
more
extreme
beers
but
all
in
moderation
and
gently
executed
a
very
restrained
beer
and
thats
what
makes
it
so
good
i
was
prepared
to
be
underwhelmed
but
i
wasnt
draft
poured
a
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
aroma
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
is
well
balanced
against
some
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
base
taste
is
also
a
wonderfully
mix
of
floral
hops
notes
from
west
coast
hops
with
nice
line
and
citrus
notes
though
they
are
never
overwhelming
malt
base
is
not
too
sweet
and
well
balanced
against
the
hops
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
this
si
one
staple
that
i
will
never
get
tired
of
o
the
classic
quintessential
american
pale
ale
the
inventor
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
well
balanced
drinkable
ales
on
the
market
perfect
for
getting
that
friend
into
craft
beer
mouthfeel
identical
to
bottle
and
draught
i
have
always
thought
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
was
quite
good
from
the
bottle
but
then
i
tried
it
from
the
can
and
found
the
flavor
far
superior
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
market
for
its
price
and
it
is
easy
to
find
very
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
with
grapefruit
lemon
and
piney
notes
and
lots
of
small
bubbles
just
enough
malt
to
counter
any
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
this
is
a
hopforward
crisp
refreshing
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
solid
one
to
buy
when
the
selection
is
limited
and
if
you
want
to
pair
with
nice
hot
sandwich
more
like
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
24
0z
a
serving
is
just
right
there
is
a
reason
why
this
beer
has
risen
to
dominance
in
the
apa
field
sierra
nevada
is
known
for
its
hops
and
this
pale
ale
has
a
really
wonderful
hoppy
aroma
the
amber
body
and
frothy
head
are
quite
appealing
as
well
tastewise
its
a
blast
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
pine
follwed
by
an
extremely
mellowing
dose
of
malts
in
many
regards
it
tastes
like
the
label
green
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
ive
found
that
it
is
not
an
everytime
beer
as
a
result
o
i
cant
think
of
many
nyc
bodegas
that
dont
stock
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
coupled
with
the
quality
of
the
beer
that
makes
it
one
of
my
gotos
overall
well
balanced
with
moderate
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
a
great
session
beer
at
5
6
abv
this
is
not
a
west
coast
ipa
but
it
is
a
classic
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
beer
has
absolutely
perfect
balance
as
well
as
awesome
drinkability
highly
enjoyable
still
i
was
perhaps
expecting
something
more
impressive
from
a
beer
that
is
famous
as
a
benchmark
for
its
style
overall
this
is
what
i
call
my
go
to
ipa
even
though
the
i
is
missing
in
the
name
ample
availability
its
characteristics
are
just
slightly
below
world
class
ipas
pliny
the
elder
for
example
great
drinkability
a
little
short
on
balance
and
feel
at
5
6
abv
i
enjoy
this
one
again
and
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
its
a
classic
version
of
the
style
and
probably
the
benchmark
for
all
other
versions
sure
there
are
newer
beers
in
the
style
i
like
better
but
sometimes
revisiting
a
classic
is
just
as
enjoyable
o
still
a
solid
brew
after
all
these
years
even
better
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
d
this
screams
session
it
doesnt
scream
out
as
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
always
solid
i
actually
feel
that
i
rate
it
to
low
because
it
is
most
likely
the
standard
to
compare
to
o
are
there
better
pale
ales
out
there
probably
yet
have
they
been
this
consistent
for
this
long
a
period
probably
not
forgot
how
easy
to
drink
this
is
and
just
what
a
good
solid
beer
it
is
just
a
classy
beer
as
it
is
o
honestly
this
is
the
standard
for
me
as
far
as
american
pale
ales
go
maybe
not
a
perfect
or
ideal
beer
but
i
have
yet
to
find
another
pale
ale
that
is
consistently
as
good
as
this
o
great
standard
classic
beer
one
to
measure
others
against
quite
happy
that
this
is
available
almost
everywhere
great
price
great
taste
a
great
american
pale
ale
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
overall
a
great
standby
that
is
widely
distributed
the
perfect
intro
to
craft
beer
as
i
know
it
got
me
into
them
not
sure
if
it
has
toned
down
since
the
days
when
there
was
sediment
in
the
bottle
but
isnt
as
impressive
as
it
used
to
be
o
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
everyday
beer
this
beer
is
a
solid
fail
safe
if
i
dont
like
the
selection
still
cant
believe
it
took
me
over
two
years
to
final
post
a
review
overall
bud
used
to
be
my
go
to
beer
snpa
is
my
new
steady
wow
shocked
not
to
have
a
review
of
this
one
on
the
books
brew
pours
a
classic
transparent
orange
with
a
few
fingers
of
foamy
head
and
chunky
lacing
smells
of
a
hoppy
pale
ale
borderline
ipa
nice
malt
balance
flavor
follows
suit
this
beer
is
the
gold
standard
for
pale
sle
in
my
opinion
you
can
funds
it
just
about
everywhere
and
even
bmc
drinkers
are
usually
excited
when
this
one
appears
in
the
cooler
drinks
like
a
gem
always
a
pleasure
and
never
a
let
down
snpa
sets
the
bar
high
o
an
excellent
display
of
aroma
and
bold
yet
delicate
hops
great
drinkability
and
flavors
that
leave
you
wanting
more
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
o
an
alltimer
and
one
that
defines
the
pale
ale
category
d
solid
for
style
one
of
the
classics
nice
summer
session
brew
o
i
will
be
buying
this
again
no
doubt
this
beer
is
good
while
not
being
overly
complicated
its
a
simple
go
to
beer
thanks
sierra
nevada
o
my
gateway
craft
beer
ive
been
drinking
this
on
and
off
for
about
15
years
a
special
beer
with
a
classic
flavor
that
is
refreshing
in
the
warm
weather
and
satisfies
completely
othis
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
tap
from
a
bottle
in
a
glass
now
in
a
can
i
have
not
tried
it
from
a
can
yet
but
i
will
soon
this
was
one
of
the
first
brews
that
introduced
me
to
the
microbeer
world
years
ago
it
complements
any
type
of
food
you
want
drink
it
cheers
ive
prolly
drank
more
snpa
than
any
other
craft
beer
this
is
and
will
continue
to
be
my
staple
session
beer
even
more
so
now
that
it
comes
in
cans
i
love
this
beer
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
any
trip
into
a
bar
with
this
on
tap
and
it
is
a
must
have
for
at
least
one
pint
i
have
always
been
a
pale
ale
kinda
dude
and
this
one
really
sets
the
bar
for
me
a
perfect
gateway
beer
for
anyone
that
wants
to
get
into
craft
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
receded
to
a
white
ring
leaving
ample
lacing
pretty
nice
very
true
to
style
scents
of
pine
citruszest
slight
orange
biscuitlike
malt
and
floral
hop
notes
a
nice
balanced
aroma
profile
of
hops
and
malt
neither
overwhelming
the
other
very
well
executed
and
pleasant
flavors
of
sweet
malt
including
caramel
and
toffee
and
some
bready
nutty
flavors
a
moderate
level
of
hop
bitterness
with
floral
pine
resin
and
citrus
zest
hop
flavors
the
citrus
zest
comes
through
more
on
the
finish
the
finish
is
dry
with
an
almost
woody
flavor
mingled
with
citrus
zest
and
pine
aftertaste
it
woody
and
modestly
bitter
a
very
good
balanced
flavor
profiling
combining
hops
and
malt
with
neither
outshining
the
other
very
good
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderatelight
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
right
body
for
a
good
session
ale
overall
this
is
a
classic
craft
beer
its
balanced
in
aroma
and
flavor
both
of
which
are
very
well
executed
in
their
constituent
elements
the
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
contributes
to
the
beers
drinkability
and
combines
with
the
flavor
and
aroma
to
make
a
classic
session
ale
one
of
the
best
easily
available
craft
beers
out
there
o
great
citrus
flavor
with
perfectly
balanced
sweet
and
bitter
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
i
like
to
keep
it
in
the
fridge
regularly
highly
recommended
for
anyone
trying
to
break
into
ipas
the
world
of
cascade
goodness
a
nice
overall
america
pale
ale
without
being
too
hoppy
for
the
average
beer
drinking
but
giving
everyone
a
nice
crafted
beer
also
the
perfect
beer
for
a
bbq
i
completely
love
the
new
can
option
and
i
think
they
should
just
eliminate
bottles
they
are
lighter
easier
to
carry
sunlight
resistant
nonbreakable
and
they
fit
better
in
the
fridge
theyre
also
more
ecofriendly
simply
a
great
example
of
pale
ale
as
the
world
has
known
or
willl
know
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
that
ive
drank
many
times
before
but
somehow
never
reviewed
overall
this
is
one
of
americas
great
originals
and
it
is
still
top
class
today
as
someone
that
appreciates
originality
it
is
hard
not
to
mention
this
as
one
of
americas
greatest
beers
it
balances
flavor
with
drinkability
like
no
other
beer
in
the
world
it
is
the
quintessential
pale
ale
a
true
american
brewing
achievement
o
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
snpa
its
good
on
a
warm
summer
day
a
cold
winter
night
with
steaks
eggs
cereal
mowing
the
lawn
right
from
the
can
into
a
glass
however
you
drink
its
one
of
my
go
to
beers
and
i
always
have
a
few
in
my
fridge
original
review
on
10192010
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
apa
for
everyone
to
enjoy
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
it
features
a
fantastic
amber
colour
a
somewhat
grassy
aroma
and
complemented
with
a
bitter
but
sweet
taste
it
feels
like
this
has
a
lot
going
on
in
terms
of
its
taste
body
and
aroma
in
terms
of
drinking
this
beer
has
sipping
qualities
a
very
easy
to
drink
yet
rewarding
and
complex
beer
i
would
absolutely
suggest
you
pick
this
up
if
you
get
a
chance
i
know
its
quite
well
established
in
the
usa
but
it
seems
to
be
picking
up
over
in
the
uk
today
if
you
spot
it
give
it
a
shot
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
look
for
this
when
i
dine
out
love
it
with
mexican
food
overall
this
is
definitely
the
baseline
for
the
apa
style
nice
balance
without
ever
overdoing
it
loses
a
little
in
the
long
run
with
the
drying
hop
profile
but
solid
and
always
worth
keeping
around
o
nicely
balanced
beer
with
an
obvious
lean
towards
the
bitterness
very
good
american
pale
ale
o
overall
a
really
good
beer
clean
crisp
refreshing
enough
hops
to
keep
you
interested
but
not
overly
bitter
all
around
good
apa
extra
points
for
being
fairly
cheap
and
available
nearly
everywhere
o
this
set
the
standard
for
the
style
and
is
still
one
of
the
best
very
well
made
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
o
everything
you
want
in
an
american
pale
quite
simply
a
style
defining
genuine
craft
classic
priced
right
and
can
be
found
anywhere
from
a
giant
liquor
store
to
your
local
roadside
gas
station
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
of
piney
citrusy
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
undertone
taste
is
initially
faintly
sweet
biscuitlike
maltiness
upfront
crisp
piney
grapefruitlike
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
somehwat
chewy
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
amber
beer
good
head
retension
lace
fresh
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
nice
pale
malt
background
finish
is
clean
and
dry
balanced
refreshing
very
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
i
could
probably
just
as
easily
give
this
all
5s
as
all
4s
it
so
perfectly
defines
the
style
the
pale
ale
that
is
the
standard
to
which
many
are
judged
sierra
nevada
really
puts
out
a
good
consistent
product
that
being
said
i
remember
being
floored
by
this
pale
ale
when
i
first
got
into
craft
it
was
like
a
mini
ipa
but
times
and
tastes
have
shifted
a
good
always
available
starter
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
overall
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
beers
i
will
never
ever
in
my
life
turn
down
a
snpa
the
quintessential
gateway
craft
beer
perhaps
i
know
it
was
one
of
my
first
and
still
holds
up
even
after
drinking
ridiculous
double
ipas
and
imperial
stouts
one
of
the
best
cheap
craft
brew
options
an
excellent
brew
for
pairing
with
food
i
must
say
thoroughly
enjoyed
with
some
homeprepared
belgian
endive
smoked
salmon
boats
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
pop
to
it
it
was
kinda
fizzy
to
me
but
it
had
a
good
hoppiness
to
it
and
it
was
a
little
less
pale
than
other
pale
ales
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
think
its
damn
good
beer
maybe
if
the
taste
wasnt
as
strong
on
the
hops
id
like
it
better
o
this
is
solid
nothing
that
youd
go
far
out
of
your
way
to
seek
out
but
a
sixer
of
cans
watching
the
water
for
dolphins
cant
be
beat
o
above
average
pale
ale
from
sierra
nevada
it
seems
like
it
is
lacking
in
the
smell
department
the
crisp
finish
and
great
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
make
it
a
decent
beer
and
coupled
with
relatively
low
abv
it
is
a
good
sessionable
craft
brew
o
one
of
the
early
craft
beers
that
i
was
introduced
to
and
enjoyed
this
beer
is
a
classic
introductory
craft
beer
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
over
the
last
15
years
and
likely
will
continue
to
get
it
as
an
everyday
kind
of
beer
overall
generally
i
like
beers
with
a
bit
more
flavor
and
aroma
but
this
is
a
fine
and
sessionable
beer
o
one
of
my
go
to
beers
now
that
sierra
is
canning
their
beers
ill
be
drinking
this
at
the
beach
all
summer
overall
very
drinkable
fantastic
one
of
my
favorites
a
bit
lacking
in
the
aroma
department
its
hard
to
beat
a
snpa
on
a
warm
spring
day
especially
a
really
fresh
one
bursting
with
grapefruit
flower
pollen
and
spicy
white
pepper
notes
clean
dry
and
drinkable
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
sugar
to
balance
out
the
ibus
i
can
see
a
12
pack
of
cans
being
a
springsummer
staple
in
my
fridge
kudos
to
sierra
nevada
for
jumping
on
the
can
trend
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
bunch
of
times
and
i
always
felt
that
the
bottles
felt
off
i
am
probably
crazy
but
i
think
the
can
format
improves
this
beer
its
a
classic
pours
slightly
hazy
and
golden
with
an
abundant
lingering
offwhite
head
as
the
head
dissipates
plenty
of
sticking
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
from
the
malt
and
also
has
aromas
of
citrus
and
pine
from
the
hops
the
flavors
up
front
are
pine
and
citrus
theres
also
some
malt
sweetness
in
the
flavor
the
flavors
are
very
wellbalanced
the
body
is
medium
and
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
pale
ale
is
perfect
for
any
occasion
and
is
a
great
way
to
introduce
someone
to
the
pale
ale
style
overall
probably
my
favourite
beer
to
session
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
and
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
my
go
to
pale
ale
that
i
was
happy
to
finally
try
on
tap
not
saying
id
never
drink
again
it
is
decent
but
just
idk
somethings
missing
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
lingers
around
a
bit
and
forms
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
citrus
consistent
with
cascade
hops
the
taste
is
an
excellent
balance
of
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
pa
overall
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
my
focus
would
be
on
hefeweizens
and
belgian
strong
ales
but
this
has
definitely
got
me
wanting
more
pas
and
ipas
as
well
as
more
sierra
nevada
in
general
highly
recommended
and
would
make
a
great
summer
relaxation
beer
great
taste
and
complexity
but
highly
drinkable
for
what
its
worth
it
has
a
pretty
nice
grassy
taste
and
smell
if
youre
a
real
hophead
this
wont
do
the
trick
but
i
personally
like
it
when
im
looking
for
a
lower
alcohol
beer
without
stepping
all
the
way
down
to
something
like
god
forbid
a
light
lager
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
am
highly
impressed
and
as
i
have
said
this
beer
deserves
its
reputation
i
could
drink
this
in
the
middle
of
winter
in
front
of
the
fire
at
a
summertime
bbq
tailgating
at
arrowhead
whatever
very
sessionable
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
o
a
classic
a
really
simple
and
clean
pale
ale
that
is
highly
approachable
in
the
future
this
will
probably
be
my
go
to
canned
beer
wow
i
love
this
in
canned
form
as
i
swear
this
is
the
freshest
tasting
that
ive
ever
had
this
beer
and
that
includes
on
draft
as
well
just
crisp
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
as
can
be
and
now
super
portable
as
well
ill
be
drinking
plenty
this
summer
overall
never
been
a
huge
sn
pa
guy
and
truth
be
told
i
thought
i
was
going
to
give
it
a
lower
rating
than
i
have
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
profile
too
much
pine
hop
in
the
mix
and
the
balance
is
skewed
toward
hop
for
sure
light
hop
bitterness
with
hoppy
flavors
of
pine
and
spice
complimented
by
a
touch
of
malt
what
i
want
in
a
pale
ale
i
think
the
end
result
adds
up
to
more
than
the
individual
aspects
hence
my
overall
rating
being
higher
than
the
other
ratings
overall
excellent
brew
the
gold
standard
for
the
american
pale
ale
category
and
i
personally
think
the
cans
make
it
better
seems
fresher
than
bottles
have
ever
been
overall
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
its
my
go
to
beer
when
theres
nothing
else
better
or
dont
know
what
to
get
a
very
balanced
apa
and
a
perfect
beer
to
represent
the
style
overall
a
overall
its
a
classic
and
something
you
can
always
rely
on
pours
a
nice
deep
honey
color
with
very
thick
and
lasting
head
high
carbonation
is
present
at
first
but
dissipates
fairly
quickly
nice
smooth
taste
with
a
light
hint
of
apple
ends
with
slightly
bitter
taste
on
tongue
and
back
of
throat
very
good
and
high
drinkability
overall
a
time
tested
recipe
thats
hard
to
dismiss
great
all
around
flavor
profile
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
malts
to
appeal
to
the
masses
one
of
several
gateway
craft
beers
that
has
led
many
folks
down
the
road
to
hopheadness
we
love
that
its
in
cans
and
well
certainly
be
pulling
a
lot
of
these
out
of
the
cooler
in
the
months
ahead
this
is
about
as
fresh
as
ive
ever
had
snpa
and
yet
i
remember
the
bottles
ive
had
in
the
past
having
a
more
robust
hop
flavor
will
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
bottle
vs
can
drinkability
probably
the
best
mass
market
apa
that
ive
seen
dont
get
me
wrong
zombie
dust
is
the
best
apa
ive
ever
tasted
but
its
not
exactly
mass
market
well
balanced
but
quite
hopforward
an
excellent
session
beer
that
ill
drink
and
serve
again
and
again
it
has
an
excellent
price
point
and
its
easy
to
drink
whats
not
to
like
dark
golden
color
with
marginal
head
and
decent
lacing
very
good
fruity
hoppy
aroma
that
lasts
flavor
is
deliciously
hoppy
with
spicy
note
with
a
good
malt
balance
quite
smooth
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
alcohol
content
good
mouthfeel
good
for
almost
any
occasion
classic
american
pale
ale
huge
cascade
aroma
and
flavoring
hops
of
cascade
and
perle
blended
perfectly
to
make
this
citrusyflowery
beer
melt
wonderfully
with
slighly
more
hop
bitternes
than
usually
found
in
similar
type
ales
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
and
easy
drinkability
a
good
pale
ale
by
sierra
nevada
somehow
i
had
always
passed
by
this
popular
treasure
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
tried
it
not
my
favorite
of
pale
ales
but
can
most
definately
have
a
seat
next
to
the
best
o
ive
been
looking
forward
to
having
this
beer
in
a
can
for
a
while
and
it
does
not
disappoint
the
cans
look
great
and
the
contents
taste
especially
vibrant
and
fresh
ov
while
far
from
the
greatest
beer
it
invites
itself
as
a
sexy
destination
for
novice
beer
drinkers
converting
to
the
wonderful
world
of
craft
the
combination
of
a
beautiful
bitter
flavor
fulfillment
and
economic
price
point
makes
the
beer
a
great
full
time
option
it
becomes
the
beer
of
choice
once
you
realize
many
bmc
choices
are
not
that
much
cheaper
than
what
sierra
nevada
has
to
offer
being
a
hop
head
you
wouldnt
think
this
would
be
up
my
alley
but
i
do
concede
to
perfect
flavor
when
it
warrants
it
and
this
one
does
just
that
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
subtle
notes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
sweet
piney
hops
the
taste
is
the
golden
standard
of
american
pale
ales
crisp
and
drinkable
yet
full
bodied
and
bold
drinkablility
is
great
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
overall
i
was
stepping
outside
my
zone
on
this
one
i
am
trying
to
be
objective
and
keep
my
mental
filters
clean
ok
i
know
others
love
this
beer
but
for
me
it
was
average
or
slightly
above
at
best
i
bought
a
12
pack
but
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
repeat
the
purchase
it
is
always
quite
possible
my
taste
buds
are
burnt
out
very
solid
pale
ale
pours
a
beautiful
golden
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
of
citrus
floral
hops
and
fresh
malt
flavor
has
notes
of
sweet
pale
malt
grapefruitfloral
and
fruity
hops
with
great
malt
balance
a
slight
touch
of
pine
pleasant
aftertaste
of
fresh
sweet
wort
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
round

sometimes
you
just
want
a
beer
that
doesnt
require
a
highmaintenance
analysis
of
its
flavor
profile
but
doesnt
taste
like
a
shitty
macro
sierra
pale
is
your
answer
tasty
enough
to
be
appreciated
humble
enough
to
have
three
or
four
in
a
row
having
it
again
reminded
me
to
keep
having
more
i
have
a
hard
time
really
finding
anything
wrong
with
it
yeeep
this
is
basically
a
tamed
version
of
sn
torpedo
i
personally
feel
this
beer
sets
that
standards
for
all
pale
ales
othis
is
a
great
beer
to
bridge
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
readily

this
beer
is
decently
priced
as
well

without
blowing
your
face
off
i
tried
this
beer
in
athens
georgia
because
i
had
heard
good
things
about
it
the
overall
look
was
great
and
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
was
good
but
its
just
the
taste
of
pale
ales
i
cant
get
past
im
more
into
dark
roast
or
cream
tasting
beers
not
knocking
this
beer
at
all
its
just
more
for
pale
ale
drinkers
a
craft
classic
always
good
to
revisit
if
youve
never
had
shame
on
you
o
i
have
been
on
an
imperial
beer
kick
so
this
was
a
big
switchup
for
me
it
doesnt
have
the
big
aromatics
and
robust
flavor
of
the
ipas
that
i
like
but
it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
with
a
fresh
clean
flavor
i
tried
my
best
to
judge
it
by
the
style
and
not
so
much
my
preference
it
wasnt
a
mindblowing
experience
but
it
didnt
suck
i
would
drink
it
again
light
refreshing
but
featuring
lots
of
taste
and
hops
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
the
first
non
macro
beers
i
encountered
with
wide
distribution
and
near
cheap
pricing
incredible
quality
given
the
amount
they
ship
the
gateway
beer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
fairly
high
drinkability
but
a
bit
too
bitter
to
be
prime
if
only
the
hops
came
through
a
bit
stronger
o
ive
had
this
many
times
previously
without
thinking
much
about
it
it
does
hold
up
well
during
evaluation
and
deserves
its
place
in
the
pantheon
of
craft
beer
its
refreshing
cleantasting
crisp
etc
all
the
things
the
bmc
offerings
have
promised
but
has
so
much
more
substance
and
flavor
its
a
dependable
solid
goto
beer
that
is
ubiquitous
and
a
terrific
value
to
boot
it
delivers
a
great
deal
for
its
modest
5

abv
i
can
understand
how
it
has
earned
a
reputation
as
a
gateway
craft
brew
like
ng
spotted
cow
has
become
more
recently
for
so
many
in
wi
one
could
be
perfectly
content
drinking
nothing
else
o
solid
ipa
id
drink
this
anytime
o
this
is
an
incredibly
crafted
pale
ale
with
great
drinkability
its
one
of
the
superior
examples
of
the
style
available
and
a
classic
bottom
line
it
should
be
tried
by
all
ill
make
no
claim
that
i
am
currently
an
acolyte
of
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
ill
tell
you
a
secret
though
i
hated
it
when
i
first
had
it
in
college
i
was
into
nutty
watery
beers
read
newcastle
and
this
tasted
like
soap
to
me
i
didnt
always
get
along
with
hoppy
flavors
it
seems
now
i
cant
imagine
a
better
stand
by
go
to
beer
in
a
jam
thank
you
sierra
nevada
for
making
such
a
palatable
robust
ale
that
is
available
nearly
anywhere
that
a
boring
tasteless
inbev
product
is
served
cheers
o
the
quintessential
pale
ale
the
one
i
bring
to
all
the
parties
and
enjoy
quietly
at
home
the
almost
light
body
keeps
it
very
drinkable
and
the
malt
qualities
keep
the
palate
fresh
to
taste
the
next
one
smells
like
beer
nothing
overpowering
the
taste
is
clean
and
balanced
with
med
to
higher
carbonation
and
good
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
hop
lingering
this
beer
is
easy
to
find
and
a
solid
option
for
any
occasion
i
will
continue
buy
and
enjoy
this
offering
as
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
o
a
very
nice
beer
well
rounded
and
delicious
a
decent
beer
at
a
decent
price
o
this
is
an
american
standard
in
the
craft
beer
world
always
there
at
the
bar
to
save
you
from
the
tasteless
macros
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
introduced
me
to
the
craft
world
and
it
remains
one
of
my
favorites
note
felt
a
little
flat
but
didnt
effect
taste
o
this
is
a
classic
beer
ive
had
it
a
bunch
of
times
but
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
it
is
one
of
those
beers
you
could
drink
all
day
because
it
tasty
and
well
balanced
to
date
i
have
consumed
more
of
this
beer
than
any
other
craft
beer
by
a
long
shot
its
a
simple
go
to
beer
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
this
beer
is
what
really
got
me
into
craft
beer
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
very
good
this
pale
can
be
found
at
any
grocery
storegas
station
o
a
really
solid
beer
there
is
a
reason
it
is
held
in
such
a
high
regard
it
is
an
incredible
session
beer
one
of
the
best
hopforward
session
beers
around
for
the
price
o
very
easy
drinking
time
for
another
o
a
simple
brew
that
taste
good
ogreat
lasting
hop
flavor
just
a
great
apa
from
a
great
american
brewery
go
and
buy
this
right
now
my
go
to
beer
when
a
local
craft
ipa
or
pale
ale
is
not
on
tap
hoppy
without
being
overly
so
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
an
aftertaste
the
aroma
is
just
like
i
always
thought
a
proper
beer
would
smell
like
certainly
the
best
mass
marketed
pale
ale
this
side
of
30
west
similar
to
pte
still
argued
the
best
of
its
respective
style
even
though
created
years
and
years
back
snpa
wayyyy
back
further
than
pte
but
you
get
the
picture
there
has
been
plenty
of
time
to
improve
upon
the
style
but
hard
to
improve
upon
the
benchmark
o
the
quintessential
west
coast
brew
one
of
the
very
original
this
is
my
go
to
in
bars
that
dont
have
a
great
selection
of
beer
the
taste
follows
very
nicely
the
hops
arent
over
powering
at
all
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
definitely
worth
the
price
sierra
nevada
always
gets
it
right
its
a
classic
still
worth
returning
to
very
drinkable
too
overall
this
is
what
a
beer
should
be
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
two
of
these
a
day
for
the
next
month
and
not
getting
a
bit
tired
of
it
moderation
is
difficult
with
beer
this
good
midwest
supplies
sells
a
clone
homebrew
kit
for
this
and
im
very
tempted
to
buy
it
and
see
how
that
goes
very
drinkable
the
hoppy
but
fairly
sweet
taste
and
classic
ale
mouthfeel
bring
the
bottom
of
the
glass
all
too
quickly
this
beer
was
exceedingly
good
for
the
style
probably
among
the
very
best
american
beers
ever
produced
and
maybe
the
best
apa
period
seems
like
i
taste
something
different
each
time
which
is
a
testament
to
their
recipe
the
ingredients
and
their
qc
procedures
taste
is
complex
a
basket
of
hops
and
it
hits
the
pale
ale
spot
every
time
one
of
a
kind
and
worth
its
cost
o
possible
the
best
pale
ale
there
is
as
a
side
note
i
somehow
i
remember
this
tasting
much
more
full
on
tap
serving
type
bottle
o
i
visited
this
brewery
in
the
late
80s
and
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
anyone
who
loves
hops
will
find
this
beer
pleasent
always
a
good
choice
fairly
widly
available
and
affordable
i
highly
enjoyed
the
beer
and
regret
having
waited
all
this
time
to
finally
try
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
if
you
want
something
easy
drinking
and
cheap
on
a
hot
day
dont
pass
this
one
up
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
orange
yellow
with
a
1
inch
fluffy
white
head
with
beautiful
lace
smell
is
pine
tangerine
biscuit
and
grass
taste
is
all
of
that
a
little
pucker
of
grapefruit
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
perfect
plenty
of
carbonation
not
overly
dry
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
legend
really
another
one
of
the
beers
that
was
a
step
in
our
quest
to
beer
snobbery
this
beer
is
over
a
100
days
old
and
still
drinking
well
o
i
am
a
fan
boy
of
this
beer
before
i
became
a
beer
geek
this
beer
was
so
bitter
i
couldnt
drink
it
now
its
probably
the
beer
ive
drank
the
most
over
the
years
despite
never
reviewing
it
until
now
this
is
the
archetype
of
the
style
and
an
amazing
beer
at
that
cheers
overall
if
you
like
grapefruit
youll
love
this
overall
im
not
a
fan
because
there
isnt
much
hops
personal
preference
this
was
my
introduction
to
sierra
nevada
and
i
have
to
say
despite
the
overall
lackluster
taste
i
have
been
introduced
to
a
brewery
that
has
much
better
beers
i
just
wish
i
had
bought
torpedo
first
as
this
to
me
is
far
too
similar
to
the
standard
macrobrews
available
perhaps
if
i
ever
have
friends
who
need
a
beer
to
drink
while
over
at
my
house
this
will
be
my
choice
brew
but
otherwise
this
one
wont
be
gracing
my
fridge
again
great
sessionable
beer
ive
been
on
a
stout
and
belgian
kick
lately
this
is
a
welcome
beer
to
break
what
may
have
otherwise
become
monotonous
i
saw
on
beer
advocate
that
this
was
an
a
so
i
was
pretty
excited
after
tasting
it
i
really
couldnt
see
why
i
also
judge
beers
quite
a
bit
on
the
balance
of
alcohol
i
want
it
to
be
there
but
not
so
obvious
this
beer
did
not
mask
its
alcohol
very
mask
it
alcohol
very
well
making
it
less
enjoyable
for
me
personally
especially
considering
it
was
only
5
6
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
better
stuff
out
there
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
o
it
is
like
a
good
old
friend
that
you
can
lose
touch
with
but
always
come
back
to
and
appreciate
delicious
hall
of
famer
o
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
tap
and
bottle
i
recommend
this
beer
o
a
good
affordable
session
beer
nothing
special
but
a
solid
american
pale
ale
overall
an
excellent
pale
ale
citrusy
and
delicious
overall
a
very
pleasing
pale
ale
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
sharp
effervescence
in
the
front
dry
finish
astringent
hops
mellow
in
the
aftertaste
but
remain
the
main
ingredient
warming
didnt
improve
this
one
quite
the
opposite
sadly
this
is
a
pale
ale
more
in
name
than
in
the
glass
drinks
like
a
good
lager
should
too
bad
it
isnt
labeled
as
one
nice
bright
orange
lots
of
fizz
and
foam
even
before
i
got
it
into
the
glass
i
could
smell
something
fruity
and
wonderful
tastes
of
sweet
tangerine
and
pineapple
mildmoderate
bitter
hop
flavour
it
tastes
like
dogfish
60
minute
but
a
little
different
soft
easy
drinking
it
is
close
to
an
ipa
style
beer
but
not
quite
so
bitter
o
a
quality
apa
deserving
of
its
reputation
as
true
to
style
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
and
one
that
really
turned
me
on
to
the
craft
beer
scene
a
few
years
ago
when
i
first
tried
it
its
still
just
as
god
as
i
remember
one
of
my
go
to
beers
for
sure
o
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
it
is
not
complex
but
is
very
good
would
certainly
recommend
note
live
review
o
3

sierra
nevada
pale
ale
got
my
hands
on
one
usually
i
like
to
have
a
few
before
i
do
a
review
but
one
will
have
to
do
the
sierra
nevada
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
aggressive
carbonation
the
slightly
offwhite
head
is
thick
even
and
lasts
to
the
end
without
a
lot
of
lasing
of
the
glass
flowery
hops
are
big
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
flavor
under
the
hop
flavor
there
a
subtle
undertones
of
malt
and
the
finish
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
in
a
good
way
the
sierra
nevada
is
a
solid
offering
that
a
beer
drinker
or
any
style
will
appreciate
glorious
if
you
dont
like
this
classic
beer
then
you
dont
like
classic
beer
taste
was
more
pine
some
grapefruit
but
while
this
may
imply
a
more
ipastyle
flavor
profile
sn
pale
ales
bountiful
malts
give
this
hops
character
a
superb
sense
of
balance
exceptional
for
the
style
and
a
superior
beer
highly
recommended
o
ive
had
this
beer
hundreds
of
times
and
have
never
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
so
i
figured
that
now
that
i
have
a
12
pack
in
my
fridge
now
would
be
the
best
opportunity
love
this
brew
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
highly
sessionable
and
just
overall
delicious
just
too
damn
good
and
such
high
quality
sierra
nevada
never
stop
making
beer
please
o
this
is
a
nice
solid
apa
but
nothing
spectacular
the
taste
is
simply
not
as
bold
as
i
would
like
this
could
easily
beer
a
session
beer
o
this
is
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
the
classic
for
the
style
the
taste
was
quite
alright
had
the
bitterness
for
sure
and
the
citrus
i
smelled
came
thru
in
the
taste
aswell
i
dont
really
have
too
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
then
its
good
to
try
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
and
again
great
light
golden
amber
color
great
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
readily
available
what
is
not
to
like
about
this
great
pale
ale
i
have
tasted
many
limited
editions
of
pale
ale
that
pale
in
comparison
to
this
fine
brew
its
about
time
i
reviewed
this
brew
i
cant
even
count
how
many
times
i
have
had
this
beer
it
has
been
my
goto
beer
all
through
college
and
even
today
it
consistantly
tastes
great
never
disapointed
that
i
bought
it
i
dont
think
i
need
to
go
into
all
the
characteristics
here
we
have
all
had
it
if
you
havent
ever
had
this
before
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
get
one
for
me
it
was
probably
the
beer
that
got
me
into
the
world
of
hoppy
style
beers
and
craft
brewing
would
love
to
visit
chico
one
day
o
this
is
my
go
to
session
beer
and
is
good
with
anything
i
love
pairing
it
with
food
hanging
with
friends
or
just
when
i
am
bored
o
its
a
craft
beer
classic
for
a
reason
people
all
the
refreshment
youd
expect
from
a
pale
lager
but
far
more
satisfying
to
drink
insane
drinkability
well
priced
very
easy
to
find
and
a
fantastic
gateway
beer
for
newbs
whats
not
to
like
the
sierra
nevada
flagship
brew
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
straight
pale
ale
but
a
delicious
beer
nonetheless
a
complex
and
robust
hop
nose
is
enticing
and
the
balanced
flavor
medium
body
and
effervescent
carbonation
make
this
a
staple
in
most
good
bars
this
is
much
hoppier
than
other
american
pale
ales
but
is
not
heavy
as
some
can
be
it
is
highly
drinkable
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
and
an
extraordinary
crispness
the
colder
the
better
350ml
bottle
poured
into
peroni
glass
foamy
head
but
i
couldnt
quite
gauge
it
because
of
the
glass
pale
copper
colour
clear
english
hops
aroma
possibly
cascade
tasted
hints
of
bananas
and
gummi
bears
very
nice
balanced
bitterness
goes
down
so
well
great
mouthfull
lots
of
character
top
beer
this
is
the
base
that
all
other
pale
ales
get
judged
to
o
a
modern
classic
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
beer
has
a
stunning
appearance
and
a
tempting
scent
with
a
pleasant
initial
taste
and
mouthfeel
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
apa
i
usually
only
drink
this
beer
if
im
in
a
bar
with
no
other
craft
on
tap
i
used
to
be
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
think
they
changed
their
formula
several
years
ago
it
is
still
a
good
beer
but
not
what
it
once
was
it
obviously
didnt
hurt
their
sales
but
if
you
are
looking
for
great
beers
check
out
some
of
their
limited
releases
and
seasonals
appearance
is
a
great
copper
tone
with
two
fingers
of
head
smells
like
west
coast
hops
all
the
way
have
always
loved
this
beer
in
bottles
but
i
think
on
tap
is
a
new
fav
lots
of
pine
and
grapefruit
noted
mouth
is
dry
and
a
easy
drinker
slick
and
wet
on
the
palate
overall
top
five
pales
in
the
american
market
imo
if
you
have
not
hade
this
on
tap
i
say
try
it
to
tell
the
difference
between
the
bottle
and
the
tap
just
fantastic
cheers
overall
this
is
the
classic
example
of
what
an
american
pale
ale
should
be
balanced
and
full
of
hop
flavor
superb
from
what
i
remember
of
the
pale
ales
that
i
tried
before
i
began
reviewing
on
ba
this
one
is
special
it
is
very
drinkable
as
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
a
row
also
if
the
hoppy
beers
are
not
your
thing
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
start
yourself
acquiring
that
taste
you
can
slowly
work
your
way
up
to
trying
more
hoppy
beers
mouthfeel
is
rich
crisp
and
provides
a
good
hops
bite
within
an
overall
balanced
apa
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
that
is
available
everywhere
to
be
enjoyed
like
old
rasputin
the
wide
distribution
should
have
no
bearing
on
how
good
these
beers
are
overall
this
is
an
absolute
staple
to
the
craft
beer
world
was
one
of
my
first
true
craft
beers
it
holds
a
sentimental
place
in
my
heart
on
my
palate
excellent
pale
ale
sorry
sweetwater
must
say
they
have
you
beat
in
this
department
this
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
bite
of
hops
in
the
finish
it
has
a
great
flavor
with
a
orange
rind
punch
i
really
like
this
pale
ale
it
is
very
light
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
clean
finish
very
good
brew
would
recommend
anyone
try
it
overall
this
is
everything
a
pale
ale
should
be
kept
within
its
limits
but
loaded
with
character
o
snpa
is
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
the
forerunner
of
the
style
is
the
absolute
best
no
but
after
years
of
challengers
coming
forward
snpa
still
stands
its
ground
refusing
to
budge
an
inch
that
this
is
so
affordable
and
so
easily
attainable
makes
it
easy
to
forget
how
good
of
a
beer
this
really
is
not
bad
at
all
o
its
very
hard
to
argue
the
quality
of
this
with
the
price
point
when
people
ask
about
the
first
craft
beer
they
should
try
i
usually
steer
them
towards
this
its
not
extreme
by
any
means
yet
is
solid
its
a
well
constructed
ale
o
great
beer
also
easy
to
find
could
drink
this
regularly
o
would
be
an
amazing
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
not
to
radical
in
any
one
direction
overall
a
very
drinkable
well
executed
pale
ale
everything
is
well
balanced
for
the
style
just
damn
good
o
literally
the
best
session
beer
for
a
hop
head
overall
the
flavor
the
price
the
avaibilty
you
cant
beat
this
beer
its
a
simple
beer
theres
nothing
special
about
the
flavors
its
just
a
straight
up
pale
ale
made
very
well
not
a
bad
way
to
get
a
hop
fix
without
getting
smashed
this
is
about
the
best
thing
i
could
find
on
the
vegas
strip
pretty
solid
stuff
though
not
the
end
all
and
be
all
pale
ale
like
everyone
claims
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
mug
right
now
the
head
started
out
thick
but
quickly
faded
nice
color
has
a
mild
citrushoppy
smell
there
is
very
little
carbonation
i
am
not
really
into
having
sediment
on
the
bottom
but
i
will
manage
has
a
mild
bitterness
for
taste
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
gathering
or
as
some
would
say
a
kick
back
overall
good
beer
more
on
the
bitter
side
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
for
myself
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
o
there
is
a
reason
this
is
one
of
the
top
selling
beers
in
the
us
it
was
the
first
american
pale
ale
in
the
world
and
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
i
dont
drink
this
as
often
as
a
should
and
it
is
so
good
out
of
the
bottle
kegs
are
co2
conditioned
best
pale
hands
down
i
honestly
dont
know
if
there
is
a
better
beer
that
gets
the
distribution
this
one
sees
next
time
you
have
a
buddy
reaching
for
a
bmc
hand
him
one
of
these
instead
i
doubt
hell
ever
go
back
cheers
six
pack
pier
lq
overall
an
impressive
4
55
highly
recommended
and
a
fine
beer
to
enjoy
year
round
thebeeralmanac
com
for
me
this
beer
was
becoming
mythical
so
much
good
written
about
it
but
i
couldnt
find
it
in
australia
finally
i
came
across
it
at
the
excellent
leura
cellars
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
overall
great
example
of
what
a
apa
should
be
in
my
opinion
its
so
well
balanced
and
rich
and
you
cant
really
expect
vast
creative
intrepretations
of
an
apa
so
i
really
cant
fault
it
for
not
having
a
unique
over
the
top
gimmick
tecnique
ingridient
or
flavour
its
an
apa
and
its
a
darn
good
example
thank
you
sierra
nevada
brewing
co
o
darn
good
beer
to
enjoy
while
doing
darn
near
anything
this
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
which
leaves
behind
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
a
little
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
initially
of
piney
hop
flavors
a
hint
of
grapefruit
and
some
caramel
there
is
some
bitter
afterflavors
but
this
is
very
crisp
and
not
as
fatiguing
as
a
super
hopped
ipa
which
i
love
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
but
full
of
bitterness
and
flavor
its
also
one
of
the
cheapest
craft
beers
to
buy
so
whats
not
to
love
the
beers
viscosity
is
slightly
on
the
light
side
which
means
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
does
not
make
much
of
it
self
while
in
the
mouth
there
is
enough
support
to
make
me
feel
i
am
drinking
a
high
quality
product
if
i
were
to
make
a
variant
i
would
try
perhaps
a
saison
yeast
at
lower
temperatures
if
the
hops
are
not
to
be
touched
overall
if
theres
a
pale
ale
out
there
better
than
this
id
like
to
know
o
a
good
pale
with
just
enough
bitterness
and
dryness
but
still
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
o
the
highlight
for
me
was
the
floral
and
grassy
hops
they
smell
and
taste
great
this
beer
also
looks
very
nice
in
the
glass
i
thought
it
was
a
little
less
smooth
than
anchor
liberty
ale
overall
one
of
the
finest
offerings
from
sierra
nevada
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
something
that
tops
torpedo
and
celebration
but
this
ranks
up
there
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
try
for
even
casual
beer
drinkers
highly
drinkable
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
it
will
not
disappoint
even
the
most
mainstream
beer
lover
4
cant
believe
for
how
many
times
i
had
this
i
never
reviewed
amber
hue
nice
foamy
off
white
head
nose
is
full
of
cascade
and
caramel
balance
a
tad
to
the
bitter
side
tasteful
citrus
and
caramel
meld
well
sure
there
are
better
apas
but
none
of
them
are
the
benchmark
that
sierra
nevadas
is
cost
at
20
is
a
little
more
than
your
usual
sixpack
is
one
small
factor
detracting
from
its
appeal
o
for
my
first
review
of
an
apa
or
ipa
for
that
matter
it
was
a
good
experience
not
too
much
on
the
hop
side
to
scare
me
away
from
more
bitter
beers
but
enough
to
give
me
a
taste
makes
me
excited
to
try
more
sierra
nevada
brews
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
fairly
decent
head
and
good
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
floral
hops
citrus
and
pine
good
hop
bitterness
maybe
a
bit
much
for
just
a
pale
ale
to
me
its
almost
borderline
ipa
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
d
highly
drinkable
making
this
an
extremely
sessionable
ale
bold
robust
flavors
for
a
pale
ale
everything
seems
to
work
well
together
an
all
around
great
beer
o
a
great
and
refreshing
beer
not
over
the
top
an
anyway
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
i
would
call
it
a
gateway
beer
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
there
was
one
offensive
smell
in
the
beer
within
the
malt
i
smelled
mildew
o
whats
not
to
like
about
drinking
fruity
flowery
beer
a
delicious
beer
that
is
somehow
available
to
me
locally
in
the
uk
which
i
will
be
buying
regularly
love
it
overall
a
classic
topnotch
american
pale
ale
really
defines
the
style
readily
available
just
about
everywhere
and
a
safe
haven
for
craft
beer
fans
when
out
and
about
love
the
interplay
of
bready
and
mildly
sweet
malt
and
piney
hops
o
a
very
tasty
and
sessionable
pale
but
i
do
have
to
say
that
the
torpedo
blows
this
out
of
the
water
was
amazed
to
see
that
id
never
reviewed
this
beer
despite
having
consumed
it
for
the
last
15
years
or
so
still
holds
up
as
a
great
hop
forward
beer
everything
is
perfectly
in
balance
and
oh
so
drinkable
overall
a
fantastic
drink
great
on
a
scorching
summers
day
like
today
o
this
is
my
first
review
and
im
still
acquiring
a
nose
and
palate
for
these
beers
ive
always
drank
more
flavorful
beer
than
your
average
consumer
and
always
leaned
toward
the
darker
smokier
brews
but
this
may
be
my
current
favorite
how
well
balanced
it
is
and
again
the
mouthfeel
puts
it
over
the
top
heres
to
americas
pale
ale
notes
so
many
american
pale
ales
aim
for
this
sierra
nevada
gets
there
well
balanced
enough
malt
to
anchor
the
hops
enough
hops
to
refresh
and
delight
like
the
other
sierra
nevada
beers
i
have
tried
this
one
says
quality
overall
drinkability
good
balanced
beer
balanced
but
not
boring
drink
this
one
on
a
fairly
regular
basis
mostly
on
tap
but
sometimes
bottled
good
thing
that
it
is
widely
available
the
color
is
always
consistent
aroma
could
almost
be
trademarked
taste
of
the
hops
is
well
balanced
by
any
residual
maltiness
very
approachable
good
anytime
o
a
very
nice
and
stable
apa
an
easily
drinkable
session
beer
i
suspect
that
it
would
be
a
great
choice
paired
with
lots
of
different
tasty
types
of
food
as
well
excellent
session
brew
this
is
the
brew
that
started
my
love
for
craft
beer
so
i
have
to
give
a
big
thank
you
for
opening
up
my
beer
virginity
and
thrusting
me
into
a
world
of
delicious
brews
i
picked
up
a
12
pack
and
popped
open
a
bottle
my
initial
reaction
was
that
it
had
no
nose
and
tasted
like
a
watered
down
ipa
the
second
bottle
i
let
sit
in
the
glass
and
warm
up
a
bit
what
a
difference
nice
understated
citric
nose
inviting
amber
gold
color
with
a
nice
head
and
lace
taste
is
grapefruit
and
pine
not
too
in
your
face
but
that
was
expected
with
an
abv
of
5
6
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
was
the
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
harsh
and
over
bubbly
that
said
i
still
would
enjoy
this
again
and
again
ive
had
a
few
in
the
past
and
will
no
doubt
have
a
few
more
in
the
future
o
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
that
is
extremely
well
balanced
drinkable
and
would
be
a
good
pairing
for
many
foods
o
the
classic
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
this
is
just
a
damn
good
beer
it
is
not
trying
to
be
anything
that
its
not
and
it
is
simple
and
up
front
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
and
years
and
finally
got
around
to
actually
adding
my
two
cents
here
and
it
will
stand
the
test
of
time
and
always
be
a
classic
12oz
bottle
served
at
53
degrees
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
bright
translucent
copper
with
a
half
inch
loose
creamy
bone
white
head
head
disperses
into
a
broken
slick
nose
is
very
subdued
but
expresses
a
light
caramel
malt
character
as
well
as
an
earthy
hops
presence
taste
follows
nose
with
that
addition
of
a
mild
citrus
character
that
intersperses
itself
through
the
flavor
profile
moutfeel
is
light
in
body
with
an
assertive
carbonation
that
lightly
burns
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
im
out
and
the
beer
list
is
limited
solid
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
a
classic
served
on
tap
at
a
local
restaurant
the
beer
i
received
had
no
head
and
neither
i
nor
my
wife
could
detect
any
aroma
the
taste
was
more
on
the
hops
side
with
a
hint
of
malt
overall
it
was
a
crisp
light
beer
with
no
after
taste
that
goes
well
with
a
burger
except
for
the
lack
of
any
aroma
this
was
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
with
good
golden
color
and
a
refreshing
taste
o
great
apa
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
staples
of
craft
beer
definitely
worth
all
of
the
love
and
hype
pours
an
orangish
golden
color
with
a
half
in
head
smells
very
earthy
has
a
bit
of
old
sock
smell
about
it
hops
are
very
noticeable
as
well
as
a
bit
of
citrus
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
lot
of
earthiness
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
not
a
very
complex
brew
but
good
this
is
a
bit
over
carbonated
for
me
but
very
satisfying
overall
this
is
a
good
everyday
beer
or
good
session
beer
overall
an
american
classic
enough
said
this
is
always
be
one
of
the
go
to
beers
for
me
this
is
the
poster
child
for
american
pale
ales
the
poster
child
may
not
always
be
the
absolute
best
but
it
is
definitely
the
one
that
gives
an
accessible
entry
into
the
subtleties
of
craft
beer
appreciation
overall
not
bad
definitely
on
the
drybitter
side
of
the
style
very
crisp
and
refreshing
could
have
done
without
the
diacetyl
the
citrus
flavor
really
is
the
highlight
in
this
one
i
know
this
is
the
classic
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
but
in
the
midwest
it
becomes
oxidized
on
the
retail
shelves
and
doesnt
hold
up
well
ive
had
one
six
pack
i
really
enjoyed
nice
piney
floral
aroma
dry
finish
bitter
spicey
taste
i
usually
wont
buy
unless
i
know
its
fresh
because
i
get
a
cardboardoxidized
taste
that
i
cant
overcome
and
usually
throw
the
rest
out
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
comes
as
pine
and
lemon
the
taste
first
off
is
malt
then
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
comes
through
neither
flavor
is
overpowering
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
easy
drinking
overall
a
good
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
anchor
offerings
for
flavour
but
this
is
even
more
drinkable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
the
flavors
are
complex
and
well
balanced
neither
malts
nor
hops
dominate
the
flavor
profile
as
all
of
the
flavors
meld
nicely
to
create
a
refreshing
beer
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
pale
you
could
refer
to
it
as
old
reliable
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
deserves
respects
as
one
of
the
originals
i
had
it
some
years
ago
before
my
palate
really
developed
and
i
didnt
care
for
it
but
it
really
sits
well
now
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
it
is
sierra
nevadas
flagship
beer
and
probably
the
beer
i
drink
the
most
because
i
buy
it
in
bulk
i
always
have
a
case
of
it
at
my
house
highly
recommended
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
drinkable
pale
ales
it
has
a
nice
tanorange
coloring
but
a
mild
and
pleasant
taste
and
smell
you
really
cannot
go
wrong
drinking
this
beer
and
i
loved
it
years
ago
when
it
was
more
difficult
to
find
better
alternatives
it
is
better
than
most
of
the
competition
but
ale
lovers
will
want
to
explore
other
offerings
if
available
o
mmm
this
stuff
really
doesnt
wow
me
in
the
slightest
lcpa
beats
it
at
its
own
game
imo
and
ive
had
several
better
local
examples
like
pacific
ale
and
harts
house
pale
ale
very
average
on
the
whole
means
just
a
solid
one
we
all
started
w
this
i
poured
a
twelve
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
backed
by
natural
light
revealed
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
a
floral
nose
well
balanced
malt
to
bitterness
on
the
tongue
good
carbonation
and
lacing
very
delicious
i
would
drink
this
beer
anytime
with
anyone
all
in
all
a
classic
pale
ale
from
sierra
nevada
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
one
note
the
first
bottle
i
had
i
drank
pretty
quickly
on
a
hot
day
and
wasnt
impressed
at
all
the
next
one
was
allowed
to
warm
up
a
tad
and
the
aroma
and
flavors
were
dramatically
improved
dont
drink
your
pale
ales
straight
out
of
the
fridge
or
you
wont
taste
anything
o
this
was
my
first
beer
ever
and
because
of
that
i
will
always
appreciate
it
i
rarely
order
when
out
at
beer
bars
but
the
nice
thing
is
it
is
usually
on
tap
at
most
dive
bars
so
this
is
my
go
to
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
generally
easy
to
acquire
it
could
be
hoppier
in
my
opinion
i
had
a
case
of
this
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
for
months
after
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
opened
my
eyes
to
the
joys
of
drinking
pale
ales
and
ipas
still
me
go
to
at
sports
bars
that
are
riddled
with
bmcs
one
of
my
favorite
beers
great
balance
throughout
and
hardly
any
weaknesses
o
this
is
thee
american
pale
ale
with
good
reason
easy
drinking
juicy
and
refreshing
hop
forward
yet
incredibly
balanced
this
has
always
been
a
great
gotobeer
this
is
the
best
example
of
what
an
apa
should
taste
like
dvery
easy
drinking
and
a
great
summer
beer
for
when
you
dont
necessarily
want
a
beer
thats
gonna
blow
your
socks
off
i
wish
they
had
a
more
discernible
dating
system
so
i
could
know
if
this
is
two
or
eight
months
old
deep
golden
bronze
with
a
2
finger
head
and
a
solid
retention
strong
floral
hops
fill
the
nose
a
nice
smooth
malt
back
bone
tons
of
lemon
citrus
piny
very
sticky
and
resin
smelling
the
taste
is
just
about
the
same
extreme
floral
flavors
so
appetizing
big
hops
big
citrus
big
bitter
zest
light
on
the
feel
crisp
refreshing
perfect
for
anytime
of
the
year
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
the
perfect
apa
m
had
good
effervescence
but
knew
when
to
quit
aka
had
good
level
of
carbonation
i
can
appreciate
the
bottle
conditioned
style
impressive
for
a
bigger
microbrewery
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
o
the
standardbearer
for
the
apa
and
for
good
reason
great
looking
and
smelling
with
above
average
characteristics
all
around
overall
while
i
prefer
the
more
hoppier
varieties
that
sierra
nevada
has
to
offer
this
beer
is
nevertheless
a
classic
in
craft
brewing
that
deserves
all
the
praise
its
received
it
may
be
gentle
on
the
mouth
yet
is
flavorful
on
the
taste
buds
a
great
pick
o
somehow
i
always
seem
to
overlook
how
good
this
beer
actually
is
the
leader
of
the
craft
beer
movement
for
a
reason
this
should
be
in
every
craft
lovers
fridge
truly
a
beer
that
is
standing
the
test
of
time
its
only
been
downgraded
here
because
of
so
many
new
amazing
beers
that
have
no
doubt
spawned
from
what
is
snpa
imo
never
dissapoints
would
definitely
never
turn
one
down
again
just
cant
say
enough
kind
of
funny
that
i
have
not
reviewed
this
one
yet
i
guess
when
you
are
always
trying
to
seek
out
new
beers
you
forget
about
the
everyday
beers
out
there
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
after
it
dissipates
it
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
thin
froth
on
the
top
slight
pine
and
dried
hop
leaf
aromas
with
a
bit
of
estery
fruit
in
the
malt
nicely
balanced
malt
and
hops
with
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
due
to
the
bottle
conditioning
a
nice
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
makes
its
presence
known
but
is
not
overpowering
funny
how
tastes
can
change
when
i
was
younger
and
new
to
beer
this
beer
seemed
so
bitter
to
me
now
after
years
of
drinking
what
seems
to
be
hoppier
and
hoppier
beers
this
one
barely
registers
to
me
this
beer
is
important
in
the
same
way
that
beers
like
sam
adams
boston
lager
are
important
they
were
pioneers
in
the
craft
beer
scene
they
are
good
benchmarks
for
the
style
and
maybe
more
importantly
they
turn
new
beer
drinkers
on
to
craft
beer
a
great
american
pale
ale
o
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
years
but
damn
i
missed
it
a
seriously
fine
apa
o
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
and
one
that
you
could
drink
as
a
session
if
not
for
the
5
6
abv
a
good
bet
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
pale
ale
good
quality
to
price
ratio
too
inevitable
inescapable
all
but
perfect
o
not
an
overly
exceptional
pale
ale
but
they
are
on
to
something
at
the
sierra
nevada
brewery
recommended
so
easy
to
take
for
granted
and
at
this
point
it
shouldnt
wow
anybody
but
theres
a
reason
why
this
was
the
keg
beer
at
my
wedding
celebration
for
balance
taste
and
accessibility
a
classic
not
a
wow
beer
but
one
you
could
drink
all
night
not
many
pales
you
can
say
that
about
i
suspect
most
are
too
heavily
hopped
notes
yeast
in
bottle
a
top
fermenter
and
is
pretty
active
and
can
be
cultured
pretty
easily
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
for
12
99
a
twelve
it
is
a
no
brainer
if
you
are
nervous
about
trying
pales
this
one
will
win
you
over
and
get
you
started
o
not
a
bad
beer
lots
of
good
flavors
and
the
mouth
feel
was
great
went
down
very
smooth
overall
i
find
it
hard
to
knock
this
beer
it
may
not
be
the
most
interesting
beer
ever
aka
the
next
best
thing
but
it
is
a
great
introduction
to
high
quality
craft
beer
i
will
definitely
be
using
pale
ale
to
introduce
my
friends
to
craft
brew
everyone
had
had
this
beer
which
validates
its
reputation
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
one
if
the
best
apas
this
is
such
a
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
have
a
pint
every
day
of
the
week
and
not
get
tired
of
it
o
solid
go
to
beer
light
and
hoppy
plus
available
year
round
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
but
good
o
impressed
by
the
ending
of
the
product
glad
i
gave
it
a
second
round
othe
hop
lovers
gateway
drug
o
a
great
all
around
beer
one
that
i
could
drink
at
any
time
a
good
pale
ale
had
to
have
something
to
drink
while
playing
pool
so
i
figured
id
revisit
this
old
classic
and
finally
review
the
damn
thing
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
flowers
lemon
peel
orange
rind
and
very
light
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
more
citrusy
hops
gaining
in
potency
a
bit
balancing
out
the
earthier
ones
pretty
nicely
all
while
the
toffee
doesnt
give
much
ground
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
one
that
deserves
the
status
it
holds
overall
this
beer
is
a
staply
amongst
bas
for
a
reason
buy
it
by
the
case
pours
a
brilliant
amber
not
very
pale
for
the
classic
apa
incredibly
balanced
taste
and
highly
drinkable
the
citrusy
sweetness
and
bitter
hops
seem
to
balance
each
other
perfectly
so
much
going
on
flavorwise
yet
nothing
overpowers
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
beer
and
while
its
no
longer
a
ridiculously
flavorful
beer
to
me
compared
to
some
its
still
a
really
good
one
and
a
great
example
of
its
style
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
some
good
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
of
citrus
lemon
mostly
taste
follows
smell
hints
of
lemon
and
hearty
hops
finishes
mildly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
good
not
a
heavy
beer
really
but
somewhat
strong
from
the
hops
a
nice
pale
ale
that
cycles
with
dales
in
my
fridge
when
i
want
one
o
a
great
tasting
session
pale
ale
i
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
come
back
and
try
this
again
but
im
glad
i
did
pours
a
copper
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
nice
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
zest
hops
there
is
a
slightly
soapy
taste
i
am
getting
as
well
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
is
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
slight
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
and
pretty
much
available
everywhere
in
a
pinch
when
there
are
no
other
good
beers
on
the
menu
o
great
beer
a
definite
regular
in
the
lineup
o
this
knocked
out
yuengling
as
my
goto
beer
an
instant
favorite
overall
this
isnt
bad
nothing
i
would
be
excited
to
drink
again
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
ever
turn
down
nothing
great
but
pretty
good
food
match
hearty
food
would
suit
this
brew
well
roast
game
birds
and
salad
with
a
celeriac
puree
and
vinaigrette
mmmm
for
me
sierra
nevada
has
yet
to
brew
a
bad
beer
cant
wait
till
they
open
their
asheville
brewery
closer
to
home
i
have
heard
this
beer
referred
to
as
the
benchmark
american
pale
ale
i
think
it
deserves
that
title
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
simple
but
not
to
a
fault
instead
its
simplicity
sort
of
makes
it
more
lovable
its
just
a
good
beer
good
night
america
t
medium
body
balanced
flavour
good
bitternes
on
the
aftertaste
long
lasting
end
this
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
an
orange
tinge
to
it
the
smell
is
pine
and
citrus
hops
with
a
subtle
malt
backbone
the
flavor
is
floral
and
slightly
hoppy
with
the
malts
coming
through
mid
sip
the
beer
is
not
to
bitter
and
has
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
i
know
many
of
us
are
beer
fanatics
but
something
is
to
be
said
of
beers
that
can
both
please
the
bud
light
drinkers
and
the
beer
snobs
this
beer
is
not
the
best
in
its
category
but
it
is
a
staple
amongst
beer
drinkers
and
is
as
good
bottled
as
on
draft
which
is
not
always
the
case
it
has
an
initial
sharp
flavor
that
fades
quickly
so
as
too
not
be
overly
offensive
a
solid
overall
beer
overall
great
american
pale
ale
highly
recommended
unfortunately
ìll
have
to
travel
abroad
to
try
it
again
o
this
is
an
example
of
a
solid
american
pale
ale
that
has
everything
nicely
balanced
one
cant
go
wrong
buying
this
truly
excellent
beer
overall
its
a
good
beer
its
affordable
available
and
tasty
this
is
my
go
too
beer
if
were
having
people
over
for
a
party
because
i
can
grab
a
bunch
for
guest
and
myself
its
also
often
the
only
craft
beer
at
a
bmc
bar
besides
sa
and
i
dont
always
want
a
lager
bottle
poured
into
a
traditional
nonic
pint
glass
two
fingers
of
foam
on
the
pour
lacing
as
i
drink
it
great
aromas
of
grapefruit
and
other
floral
hops
very
smooth
taste
the
malt
and
the
bitterness
blend
very
well
together
the
finish
is
quick
and
clean
that
makes
you
seem
more
thirsty
as
you
drink
very
balanced
great
beer
m
it
is
medium
complex
almost
not
sweetness
at
the
beginning
and
then
fast
turns
into
bitter
and
hard
bitter
with
long
ending
that
leaves
a
medium
nice
sensation
pours
a
slightly
hazed
depending
on
temperature
copper
color
with
anywhere
between
12
and
3
fingers
of
frothy
white
head
grainy
aroma
with
a
certain
caramel
smoothness
underlain
smooth
malts
in
the
taste
grains
balanced
by
crisp
nonthreatening
hoppiness
and
just
a
implication
of
citrus
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
easily
drinkable
the
classic
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
i
remember
sitting
at
the
keystone
pub
when
i
ordered
my
first
one
back
in
2007
it
was
probably
one
of
my
first
pale
ales
i
cant
recall
having
one
prior
to
it
anyway
it
pours
out
as
a
lightly
hazed
yellowish
gold
color
the
head
is
strong
and
leaves
a
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
hop
aroms
on
it
mixed
with
some
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
good
bitterness
to
it
with
a
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
when
it
comes
to
the
mouthfeel
its
a
highly
drinkable
beer
its
got
a
good
body
to
it
and
its
not
overly
heavy
overall
this
beer
is
worth
checking
out
if
you
havent
already
its
a
pioneer
pale
ale
it
really
holds
its
own
again
many
competitors
o
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
a
snpa
it
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
like
today
i
can
and
plan
on
drinking
this
all
day
o
one
of
my
favorite
if
not
the
favorite
commercial
larger
brewery
pale
ales
keep
up
the
great
work
sn
overall
great
beer
my
2nd
time
out
of
the
bottle
however
had
many
on
tap
strongly
suggest
you
seek
that
experience
out
if
you
have
access
i
whole
heartedly
recommend
this
beer
to
me
it
is
to
pale
ale
as
sam
adams
is
to
american
lager
something
combining
just
enough
originality
with
tradition
and
just
enough
mass
market
appeal
with
craft
street
cred
highly
recommended
cower
in
shame
budweiser
this
is
americas
real
king
of
beers
overall
a
solid
beer
and
the
gold
standard
of
rating
pale
ale
this
is
a
ok
crafted
pale
ale
although
its
got
quite
a
dry
bitter
hop
bite
to
it
that
makes
it
hard
on
the
pallet
and
not
easy
to
repeat
samplings
not
nearly
as
well
craftedbalanced
as
the
sn
torpedo
ipa
this
apa
could
be
smoother
and
a
little
more
refreshing
it
has
some
positive
flavoring
notes
but
seems
a
little
off
balanced
with
bitter
hops
and
takes
some
effort
to
get
down
the
full
12
oz
i
go
to
this
a
few
times
a
year
because
its
so
common
but
its
usually
a
1
and
done
sampling
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
pale
ale
this
beer
actually
took
away
my
craft
beer
virginity
almost
10
years
ago
finally
got
around
to
writing
a
review
thank
you
to
bierkraft
for
getting
me
a
six
before
i
deploy
difinitely
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
appearance
is
a
rich
dark
golden
with
mild
head
and
mild
lacing
smell
is
the
sn
hop
presences
i
have
grown
to
love
nice
and
floral
and
piney
taste
is
fairly
complex
for
a
pale
ale
floral
citrusy
a
little
spicey
or
peppery
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
west
coast
or
american
pale
ale
and
what
makes
me
proud
to
be
an
american
othe
best
intro
beer
to
newbies
the
safest
bet
to
get
at
a
bar
when
there
isnt
a
craft
option
a
better
choice
than
boston
lager
a
solid
beer
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
o
the
best
american
pale
that
is
readily
available
both
at
home
and
in
barsrestaurants
o
this
is
my
favorite
beer
great
anytime
of
the
year
o
a
refreshing
classic
and
one
of
my
summertime

was
wonderful
as
it
hung
to
the
glass
during
the
entire
pint
aroma
of
some
citrus
malt
with
some
floral
tones
mixed
in
taste
was
very
nice
malt
breadbiscuit
a
touch
of
honey
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
one
of
the
brews
that
got
me
hooked
on
craft
ill
revisit
this
one
again
and
again
sn
pale
ale
is
one
of
the
classic
of
american
craft
brewing
these
days
its
probably
overshadowed
by
bigger
bolder
beers
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
wellmade
craft
beer
that
has
withstood
the
test
of
time
this
is
one
to
seek
out
overall
would
definitly
drink
this
again
as
it
is
allways
welcome
in
my
glass
never
have
i
seen
this
in
24
oz
bottles
in
pa
bought
all
they
had
in
stock
in
a
small
lakeside
store
in
ohio
its
like
drinking
a
good
beer
and
bonus
heres
another
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
is
quite
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
delicious
try
it
overall
i
must
say
that
i
really
couldnt
find
anything
wrong
with
this
brew
it
was
tasty
looked
really
good
and
had
me
coming
back
for
more
i
was
really
happy
to
find
this
at
the
gas
station
next
to
my
place
too
i
really
cant
think
of
a
better
pale
ale
off
the
top
of
my
head
get
it
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
this
has
been
my
favorite
beer
since
1994
and
is
the
reason
i
started
exploring
craft
beers
a
very
high
recommendation
as
this
beer
is
consistently
good
and
always
enjoyable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
its
a
very
smooth
beer
that
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
in
fact
i
think
ill
have
one
right
now
this
is
the
true
american
pale
ale
sure
there
may
be
better
american
pales
out
there
but
this
is
the
stepping
stone
for
all
others
this
is
the
grandfather
and
the
one
they
are
all
compared
to
just
a
very
clean
refreshing
ale
that
looks
undisturbed
and
clings
to
the
palate
in
the
smoothest
fashion
that
makes
you
question
were
another
one
is
i
love
this
brew
and
look
for
it
everytime
i
am
at
dinner
d
this
was
one
of
my
first
beers
that
i
had
after
getting
into
beer
in
general
and
has
only
gotten
better
for
me
over
time
there
is
no
food
this
doesnt
go
with
either
thumbs
up
if
you
like
their
signature
malt
youll
be
pleased
otherwise
there
isnt
a
lot
here
to
hold
your
interest
compared
to
the
dozens
of
superior
examples
of
the
style
like
fat
tire
its
a
good
alternative
to
bmc
at
bars
with
poor
selections
or
beergeekfree
parties
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorites
not
too
hoppy
and
with
a
nice
blend
of
malts
a
great
go
to
beer
if
ales
are
your
thing
overall
good
beer
no
wonder
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
drinks
light
a
light
ipa
rather
than
an
apa
and
thats
definitely
a
good
thing
since
apas
typically
leave
me
wanting
more
if
you
havent
gotten
around
to
this
beer
yet
what
are
you
waiting
for
cheers
o
i
cant
believe
this
beer
only
cost
me
16
for
a
12pack
you
can
hardly
find
buds
for
that
cheap
certainly
a
great
deal
like
i
mentioned
before
though
i
did
have
high
standards
for
this
beer
now
im
not
going
to
say
i
was
disappointed
because
i
wasnt
in
fact
after
having
this
beer
i
find
myself
wishing
we
had
more
breweries
like
sierra
nevada
all
in
all
this
is
a
clear
example
of
sns
willingness
to
create
the
best
beer
from
whatever
ingredients
they
have
and
then
putting
it
in
the
same
price
range
as
many
highlycommercial
counterparts
i
can
certainly
respect
a
brand
like
that
in
the
future
though
ill
pay
the
extra
couple
bucks
and
get
their
torpedo
extra
india
pale
ale
if
im
looking
for
a
pa
with
a
great
price
tag
cheers
o
a
true
classic
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
the
palate
is
left
completely
cleansed
after
each
sip
and
ready
for
another
the
hops
dominate
with
just
enough
yeasty
goodness
to
balance
it
out
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
in
their
beerdrinking
career
as
it
warms
im
getting
some
more
tastes
from
the
hops
other
than
just
the
orange
fruitiness
i
can
taste
some
tea
and
herbal
flavors
as
well
which
tastes
excellent
perfect
craft
session
beer
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
you
can
definitely
tell
why
just
by
the
first
sip
of
this
incredible
pale
ale
o
this
has
always
been
a
fantastic
and
historic
beer
dunno
why
but
this
one
is
a
little
off
will
admit
to
inflating
the
scores
a
hare
based
on
my
previous
experiences
with
the
beer
o
this
isnt
the
most
drinkable
pale
ale
youll
come
across
due
to
the
dry
bitterness
but
its
still
excellent
one
of
the
seminal
american
craft
beers
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
doesnt
disappoint
pours
from
the
bottle
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
the
smell
is
pine
and
resin
the
taste
is
great
a
really
wonderful
session
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
my
introduction
to
great
craft
beer
still
a
winner
o
this
being
one
of
my
first
reviews
i
had
to
do
one
of
my
old
standbys
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
o
a
very
good
go
to
beer
and
just
short
of
exemplary
for
the
style
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
when
youre
looking
for
something
to
session
on
the
other
hand
this
is
not
going
to
not
your
socks
off
in
any
way
just
good
stuff
all
around
obviously
this
beer
is
a
classic
it
is
widely
available
and
worth
returning
to
every
so
often
even
though
i
worship
the
hop
i
usually
like
my
unimperial
pale
ales
a
bit
more
balanced
than
this
one
still
it
tastes
darn
good
overall
great
very
drinkable
refreshing
flavorful
exactly
what
i
want
from
a
sessionable
pale
ale
this
along
with
anchor
steam
is
a
nobrainer
as
far
as
quality
widely
accessible
brews
that
exemplifies
american
craft
brewing
beautiful
overalli
can
see
myself
50
years
from
now
still
enjoying
this
beer
it
goes
great
with
food
too
i
do
my
grading
to
style
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
pale
ale
i
would
drink
this
next
to
a
buddy
drinking
a
pliny
and
i
would
be
completely
satisfied
o
great
craft
beer
that
is
readily
available
highly
recommended
do
drinkability
on
this
is
awesome
right
up
there
with
the
best
flavordrinkability
ratio
there
is
a
gateway
drug
is
there
ever
was
one
the
color
smell
and
taste
dont
disappoint
this
an
american
west
coast
pale
ale
and
it
is
wonderful
it
is
very
bitter
yet
quite
drinkable
it
goes
well
with
appetizers
a
meal
or
as
a
session
beer
it
is
perfect
on
a
hot
day
to
quench
a
big
thirst
it
has
so
much
flavor
body
and
smoothness
for
a
pale
ale
its
still
one
of
the
all
time
great
craft
beers
summary
reasonably
priced
with
smooth
and
stimulating
flavor
and
texture
o
great
beer
for
spring
summer
or
fall
not
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
but
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
enjoyable
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
as
a
stepping
stone
into
pale
ales
o
pretty
straightforward
brew
but
definitley
above
average
for
the
syle
a
good
one
to
always
have
on
hand
the
only
craft
beer
at
the
restaurant
that
is
closest
to
my
home
i
usually
go
for
the
martinis
at
this
place
but
my
resurrected
love
of
beer
caused
me
to
ask
what
was
available
tender
reaches
into
the
recesses
of
the
fridge
and
pulls
this
one
out
buried
behind
the
dismal
and
prolific
adjuncts
of
the
world
in
all
the
years
ive
been
drinking
beer
ive
never
had
this
one
before
and
now
im
wondering
what
the
hell
took
me
so
long
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
highly
drinkable
and
just
tasty
overall
nice
light
and
crisp
body
on
this
one
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
on
this
one
though
overall
a
solid
brew
that
ive
had
countless
times
really
a
good
brew
that
ill
continue
to
buy
easy
to
forget
how
good
this
beer
actually
is
superbly
balanced
but
hopped
enough
to
shame
some
lesser
ipas
glad
this
is
in
all
50
states
and
around
the
world
o
sierra
nevada
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
im
not
looking
to
spend
too
much
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
be
something
it
isnt
make
sure
to
look
at
the
date
if
youre
buying
a
12
or
24
pack
the
fresher
the
better
one
of
the
best
allaround
beers
out
there
and
one
that
i
will
always
accept
willingly
when
offered
one
that
apparently
got
a
lot
of
people
into
craft
beers
me
included
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
one
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
this
is
perfectly
done
and
very
well
balanced
might
be
too
hoppy
for
some
but
for
me
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
a
perfect
session
beer
among
my
noncraft
drinking
friends
this
seems
to
be
a
favorite
just
the
same
so
the
beer
is
really
offering
something
for
everyone
solid
beer
drunkability
solid
american
pale
ale
it
is
a
good
stand
by
because
it
is
pretty
easy
to
get
ahold
of
nation
wide
however
i
endorse
drinkin
local
beer
so
i
must
say
that
this
would
taste
even
better
if
i
were
sippin
it
fresh
in
chico
cali
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
holds
up
well
despite
being
such
an
early
example
of
craft
brewing
my
only
complaint
is
a
lack
of
complexity
with
the
hops
so
dominant
o
d
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
that
is
not
mind
blowing
in
any
way
but
its
very
good
and
very
drinkable
and
i
find
it
to
be
rather
sessionable
a
great
beer
year
round
for
sure
o
just
a
great
beer
imo
perfect
example
of
the
apa
style
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
and
am
impressed
by
how
enjoyable
and
interesting
it
is
made
better
because
i
can
find
it
anywhere
i
cant
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
review
this
beer
ive
only
been
drinking
it
forever
decent
pour
honey
amber
with
a
white
head
that
actually
creates
lacing
surprising
as
i
usually
drink
this
out
of
the
bottle
aroma
is
kinda
hoppy
i
guess
more
bitter
and
grassy
and
vegitile
the
flavor
is
of
pale
malt
and
grassy
whole
leaf
hops
some
herbacious
taste
and
a
mite
of
floral
woody
hops
regular
body
nothing
special
overall
it
is
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
period
o
pretty
standard
pale
ale
the
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
that
first
greet
your
mouth
hide
the
nice
malt
and
hop
flavors
that
come
through
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
decent
pale
ale
wont
be
grabbing
six
packs
of
this
any
time
soon
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
a
lot
of
other
pale
ales
and
the
finish
is
a
good
dry
as
mentioned
earlier
carbonation
is
at
the
right
level
as
well
drinkability
is
phenomenal
as
the
flavors
arent
too
strong
but
arent
pushovers
either
and
the
finish
is
easy
and
dry
readily
available
and
really
good
is
an
awesome
combination
overall
a
very
tasty
ale
with
a
very
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
o
a
great
pale
ale
pretty
dry
and
straightforward
this
is
definitely
a
favorite
apa
overall
very
hoppy
pale
but
as
a
hophead
i
like
it
i
give
this
a
thumbs
up
go
grab
one
for
yourself
and
give
it
a
go
overall
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
go
to
beers
is
it
mind
blowing
no
but
is
it
delicious
absolutly
it
is
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
slight
stickiness
on
the
lips
overall
its
good
but
not
what
i
would
consider
the
be
all
and
end
all
for
apas
i
prefer
great
lakes
burning
river
and
deschutes
mirror
pond
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
i
can
enjoy
this
beer
all
year
long
the
appearance
is
on
par
with
most
other
pale
ales
however
the
taste
is
in
my
opinion
much
better
this
beer
is
always
seems
fresh
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
bold
taste
if
you
are
someone
that
like
sweeter
beers
this
may
not
be
the
one
for
you
if
you
are
looking
to
try
a
good
pale
ale
to
get
introduced
to
the
style
then
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
youll
be
hooked
pours
an
appealing
amberorange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
not
alot
of
hop
on
the
nose
but
a
nice
malty
ale
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
bitter
level
on
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
makes
this
beer
the
hops
were
used
as
a
bittering
agent
here
and
i
dont
offer
much
on
the
nose
or
taste
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
making
this
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
good
for
a
couple
cold
ones
this
is
a
great
drink
for
a
hot
sunny
summer
day
overall
while
not
my
start
this
beer
was
the
beer
that
launched
a
thousand
beer
nerds
probably
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
by
now
crisp
clean
and
very
much
an
antithesis
to
other
fizzy
yellowish
water
that
for
most
craft
lovers
came
before
snpa
not
my
favorite
apa
but
after
having
so
many
in
the
style
sierra
nevada
still
holds
its
own
after
so
many
years
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
beer
i
can
no
longer
go
to
the
package
store
without
picking
up
some
sierra
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
strong
but
enough
going
on
to
bring
me
back
for
a
few
more
nicely
complex
without
overpowering
overall
much
more
refreshing
than
i
was
expecting
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
best
outside
on
a
hot
day
or
after
a
long
day
of
work
a
solid
offering
that
i
would
buy
again
hey
even
after
all
this
time
you
still
got
the
goods
love
ya
i
really
like
the
flavors
in
this
uncomplicated
but
still
compelling
will
surely
buy
it
again
d
a
very
common
very
well
made
apa
i
would
imagine
just
about
every
user
on
this
site
has
had
this
one
at
one
point
not
my
all
time
favorite
apa
but
definitely
an
american
classic
found
a
bottle
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
about
2
months
after
i
bought
the
twelver
same
great
taste
as
that
day
slightly
bitter
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
not
a
beer
to
have
more
than
3
or
four
at
a
time
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
when
im
relaxing
with
some
friends
definitely
a
go
to
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
has
always
been
a
go
to
beer
and
i
dont
ever
see
that
changing
overall
probably
one
of
the
most
sessionable
craft
beers
i
have
yet
to
come
across
i
could
drink
this
all
day
again
a
classic
its
a
consistent
wellmade
pale
hoppy
enough
and
very
satisfying
i
didnt
have
many
choices
today
but
i
had
this
one
good
old
friend
available
t
citrus
hops
and
a
lot
of
biscuity
malt
a
little
lemon
and
grapefruit
in
there
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
just
not
my
favorite
one
of
my
go
to
beers
as
its
readily
available
very
affordable
and
very
balanced
to
me
a
stronger
presence
than
traditional
english
pale
ales
so
as
a
representation
of
the
style
i
like
it
the
body
fits
but
the
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
more
depth
drinkable
but
not
overly
enthused
about
the
next
mouthful
the
feel

that

this

drinkability
has
been
switched

this
is
a
welcome
change
in
my

this

i
always
enjoy

serves
as
the

for
this
beer
one
of
the
best
apas
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
classic
american
beer
that
helped
save
beer
here
in
america
you
can
not
go
wrong
by
falling
back
to
this
american
classic
d
from
reading
other
reviews
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
profile
with
this
beer
so
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
in
that
aspect
but
thats
not
to
say
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
if
this
was
available
in
canada
i
would
probably
keep
this
stocked
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
absolutely
a
worthy
beer
and
not
terribly
hard
to
find
either
sierra
nevadas
staple
beer
and
great
for
those
that
love
the
moderately
bitter
pale
ales
md
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
low
dextrin
could
use
more
body
to
finish
a
bit
stronger
a
bit
watery
very
drinkable
and
could
be
a
staple
drinkin
beer
drinkability
really
disappointed
here
had
hopes
of
making
this
a
goto
apa
due
to
price
availablity
ive
had
much
better
just
too
many
floaters
and
not
enough
flavor
for
a
pa
ill
pass
next
time
the
original
american
pale
ale
does
not
fail
to
please
this
is
a
great
beer
with
incredible
drinkability
while
still
packing
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
and
nuance
into
what
can
be
a
relatively
boring
style
love
it
a
nice
hop
infused
pale
ale
golden
amber
poured
with
a
huge
head
from
my
24
oz
bottle
nice
tones
of
malt
with
a
hop
twist
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
it
taste
better
right
from
the
bottle
light
and
crisp
all
the
way
through
i
can
see
why
this
is
their
flagship
beer
i
love
it
if
i
had
to
pick
one
beer
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
might
possibly
be
it
cheers
crisp
flavor
and
fresh
smell
work
well
with
the
carbonation
and
lower
serving
temperature
sure
its
a
little
stronger
than
your
typical
english
ale
but
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
summer
or
winter
whether
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
refresher
or
a
warmer
snpa
always
works
edit
having
this
again
and
had
to
knock
it
down
a
bit
on
aroma
and
overall
since
overall
is
no
longer
drinkability
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
those
who
dont
who
drink
mostly
pilsners
and
light
beers
d
this
is
such
an
easy
drinker
love
the
flavor
and
drinkability
will
get
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
sure
notes
on
20110617
i
had
this
sidebyside
with
an
orval
it
was
fun
to
compare
and
contrast
these
two
fine
beers
for
a
daytoday
brew
id
prefer
the
snpa
overall
this
is
mine
and
most
people
who
like
good
beers
go
to
beer
when
we
cant
find
anything
else
at
a
bar
you
can
almost
guarantee
they
will
have
snpa
even
when
their
are
other
beers
ill
get
this
one
its
also
the
beer
you
can
buy
a
case
of
year
round
and
relax
to
at
home
after
a
hard
day
at
work
thank
you
snpa
i
also
owe
a
lot
to
sierra
nevada
and
this
beer
in
particular
to
introducing
me
to
the
world
of
high
quality
craft
beer
as
a
student
in
chico
i
was
introduced
to
this
beer
very
early
and
it
became
my
most
loyal
study
partner
shortly
after
cheers
cheers
d
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
goes
down
nice
and
easy
and
wont
get
you
too
messed
up
too
fast
good
allaround
beer
that
is
widely
available
and
well
priced
notes
highly
recommended
i
have
come
back
to
the
pale
ale
after
it
was
a
staple
in
my
fridge
a
few
years
ago
i
love
this
beer
and
will
drink
many
times
in
the
future
the
cpj
go
get
some
i
bet
you
will
thank
me
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
on
it
smelled
like
hops
not
a
lot
else
taste
was
very
good
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
good
light
mouthfeel
very
drainable
beer
this
is
my
first
time
trying
it
but
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
light
in
body
and
very
crisp
the
medium
carbonation
helps
out
in
the
mouth
feel
the
alcohol
isnt
to
high
and
the
flavor
is
just
right
to
make
this
a
damn
drinkable
brew
this
is
one
of
the
best
allaround
beers
ive
had
it
is
the
perfect
representation
of
a
pale
ale
perfect
malthop
balance
and
an
overall
fantastic
flavor
not
a
weak
ale
but
not
too
strong
either
this
flagship
of
sierra
nevada
is
everything
an
american
craft
brew
should
be
a
goto
beer
in
my
house
d
im
not
sure
you
can
get
much
more
drinkable
than
this
this
is
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
its
delicious
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
perfect
session
ale
always
a
solid
beer
however
many
more
interesting
beers
are
out
there
for
the
finding
drinkability
usually
excellent
although
occasionally
im
in
the
mood
for
something
else
the
granddaddy
of
craft
beers
my
first
whatisthis
beer
moment
when
i
had
some
in
the
late
80s
it
is
no
longer
a
pioneer
or
a
wow
by
craft
beer
standards
but
it
has
held
up
remarkably
well
as
a
mild
versatile
enjoyable
pale
ale
pours
a
sunny
reddish
gold
with
a
slight
quickfalling
head
and
lively
carbonation
from
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
malty
with
a
little
bread
and
caramel
and
a
whiff
of
citrusy
hops
the
flavor
seems
almost
quaint
in
this
day
of
punishing
citrus
hops
but
it
is
clean
crisp
slightly
malty
with
a
restrained
dose
of
citrus
hops
and
a
mellow
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
a
little
prickly
pours
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
large
3
finger
head
lacing
is
ok
but
honestly
this
looks
like
almost
any
beer
similar
to
this
no
really
stong
smells
but
what
is
there
is
a
bready
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
pine
the
taste
is
more
bready
malt
at
first
but
after
a
while
it
just
overbears
your
taste
buds
and
it
becomes
a
very
bland
malt
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
too
prickly
for
more
liking
and
really
brings
down
the
drinkability
after
a
while
it
is
ok
for
what
it
is
but
not
a
great
craft
beer
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
my
go
to
it
has
a
great
taste
and
is
easy
to
get
anywhere
for
the
reasonable
price
i
have
had
this
on
draught
as
well
and
its
even
better
if
you
are
an
ale
fan
this
is
one
to
try
or
retry
i
would
like
to
try
and
make
my
own
personal
brew
similar
to
this
one
i
find
this
beer
to
be
close
to
an
ipa
its
fairly
hoppy
but
also
rather
sweet
and
buttery
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
i
suppose
that
interpretation
of
this
is
subject
to
the
tasters
palate
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
ill
close
with
what
others
before
me
have
stated
its
a
very
good
apa
its
also
definately
worth
trying
if
you
havent
done
so
before
snpa
is
medium
body
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
with
an
abv
slightly
too
high
to
justify
it
as
a
session
beer
sierra
nevada
pale
is
one
of
the
quintessential
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
brews
d
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
apa
can
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
and
would
want
to
have
had
many
times
and
will
have
many
times
again
before
having
this
i
was
aware
of
its
reputation
and
had
previously
tried
the
wonderful
spring
summer
and
winter
seasonals
even
though
i
had
some
expieriance
under
my
belt
it
still
shocked
me
super
well
balanced
perfect
light
use
of
hops
and
malts
really
refreshing
i
really
wish
i
had
tried
this
earlier
i
gave
the
appearance
and
smell
a
4
5
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
4
because
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
it
unlike
the
taste
and
what
have
you
it
doesnt
matter
what
it
looks
or
tastes
like
everything
else
makes
up
for
it
go
out
and
buy
you
a
case
cant
wait
to
try
torpedo
im
afraid
i
may
have
done
irreversible
damage
to
my
taste
buds
by
a
constant
thrashing
of
west
coast
ipas
so
i
must
admit
this
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
it
lacks
what
i
personally
look
for
in
a
beer
which
is
a
lot
of
flavor
every
time
i
take
a
drink
the
first
few
sips
were
good
and
then
it
started
to
get
a
little
bland
on
me
but
with
all
that
said
this
is
a
terrific
apa
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
representation
of
the
style
despite
the
uncertainty
of
truly
liking
the
taste
of
the
beer
and
the
okay
mouth
feel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
crisp
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
go
down
4
5
d
an
excellent
hopcentric
pale
ale
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
through
and
through
nothing
remarkable
on
any
front
except
that
it
borders
at
least
in
taste
on
the
mild
side
of
ipa
i
get
very
limited
malts
from
this
if
im
in
the
mood
for
hops
and
need
something
light
this
is
a
no
brainer
more
often
than
not
when
i
look
to
a
pale
ale
however
i
want
something
a
little
more
balanced
i
got
a
six
pack
and
had
four
without
even
realizing
snpa
is
the
beer
an
amazing
pale
ale
one
of
its
greatest
characters
is
how
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
ingredients
are
it
does
lack
real
bite
that
im
looking
for
even
as
pales
are
considered
great
beer
and
will
be
buying
this
one
again
id
be
seriously
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
a
keg
of
this
beer
d
this
is
as
drinkable
as
any
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
really
a
firstrate
beer
i
will
keep
this
in
my
fridge
verdict
defintely
a
tasty
and
delicious
beer
when
im
just
in
the
mood
to
have
a
beer
in
general
this
is
what
i
reach
for
i
have
had
it
several
times
bottled
and
on
tap
having
drank
this
out
of
the
bottle
i
cant
say
much
for
appearance
but
the
beer
did
give
a
nice
scent
the
taste
was
great
it
was
you
average
high
quality
hoppy
taste
however
it
went
down
and
finished
incredibly
smooth
i
watched
a
youtube
review
from
the
real
ale
guide
and
i
have
to
agree
with
his
almost
warning
to
watch
out
because
you
can
easily
drink
these
down
fast
its
that
good
of
a
beer
it
has
its
bitterness
but
wonderful
finishing
flavor
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
pours
a
beautiful
golden
amber
with
just
a
bit
of
sediment
that
sinks
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
generous
3
finger
head
with
lots
of
sticky
white
lacing
the
smell
consists
of
malty
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
very
balanced
some
biscuit
and
grassy
floral
notes
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
the
hops
flavor
topping
the
malt
as
it
should
grassy
and
floral
taste
without
having
too
much
bitterness
this
brew
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
balanced
pale
ale
medium
mouthfeel
with
just
a
touch
of
chewiness
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
what
an
american
pale
ale
should
be
d
its
my
go
to
beer
always
a
12pk
available
in
the
fridge
good
for
spring
and
summer
or
anytime
really
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
a
classic
pale
ale
and
an
excellent
session
brew
i
dont
know
how
many
times
ive
had
this
but
finally
time
to
review
it
had
this
at
a
mexican
bar
somewhere
in
napa
at
happy
hour
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
a
finger
of
white
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
hops
with
some
sweet
caramel
flavour
has
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
it
obviously
a
classic
pale
ale
overall
i
like
this
beer
id
say
if
youre
looking
for
a
standard
pale
ale
or
beer
in
general
this
would
be
a
go
to
for
me
however
i
feel
like
its
lacking
in
complexity
maybe
im
just
used
to
other
styles
very
solid
apa
that
is
now
a
staple
in
my
beer
diet
as
it
is
a
great
value
and
easily
available
dgood
drinking
beer
and
sold
company
d
decent
apa
frankly
some
are
better
but
some
are
worse
where
choices
might
be
limited
this
would
be
a
solid
choice
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
pine
and
pine
hops
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
pine
pine
hops
and
nutmeg
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
as
i
said
before
this
was
my
gateway
drug
my
palate
is
a
lot
different
now
than
it
was
this
brew
wasnt
overly
great
but
i
can
see
why
i
started
out
drinking
this
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
it
is
just
that
the
nutmeg
i
got
on
the
followthrough
is
in
nowayshapeorform
one
of
my
favorites
still
one
of
the
easiest
to
find
and
better
tasting
pale
ales
out
there
in
my
opinion
d
highly
drinkable
easy
and
enjoyable
d
good
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
this
is
overall
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
by
far
ill
definitely
be
drinking
it
again
appearance
when
poured
in
a
glass
nice
head
after
pouring
had
a
golden
brown
color
smell
had
a
nice
aroma
that
was
a
bold
fragrance
of
hopps
taste
bold
taste
something
with
a
high
hint
of
hopps
mouthfeel
the
first
taste
this
beer
started
on
the
bold
side
of
a
strong
beer
but
the
follow
up
taste
mellow
out
making
it
very
enjoyable
drinkability
a
very
great
beer
for
this
last
comment
its
refreshing
and
mellows
out
the
more
you
drink
drinkability
this
is
really
one
of
those
allday
everyday
kind
of
beers
with
the
nice
flavors
that
dont
wreck
your
palate
and
a
pretty
doable
abv
that
clocks
in
below
6
this
beer
drinks
great
for
a
relativly
affordable
and
accessable
beverage
at
5
6
abv
it
is
perfect
for
me
to
drink
a
few
anytime
and
goes
great
with
most
meals
this
was
may
first
american
pale
ale
of
of
its
style
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
brew
before
and
it
defiantly
lived
up
to
what
ive
heard
drinkability
despite
the
poor
appearance
which
i
chalk
up
to
the
serving
glass
and
not
the
beer
this
beer
is
an
allaround
good
one
went
very
well
with
the
meal
angus
burger
sliders
and
garlic
green
beans
and
i
could
see
this
going
very
well
with
many
others
very
tasty
beer
which
i
could
have
another
and
another
of
with
little
complaint
a
classic
and
pioneer
in
craft
beer
usually
poured
out
of
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
or
on
tap
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
cloudiness
aroma
has
the
cascade
hops
up
front
bringing
out
that
nice
floral
undertone
there
also
seems
to
be
a
little
orange
present
in
this
also
the
flavor
is
what
i
would
consider
to
be
probably
the
true
american
pale
ale
the
malts
are
present
up
front
along
with
their
counterpart
hops
nice
and
refreshing
following
behind
these
two
ingredients
would
have
to
be
that
orange
i
smelled
earlier
there
is
also
a
little
pepper
and
floral
in
the
back
end
leaves
a
bitter
and
refreshing
taste
in
the
end
good
classic
beer
again
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
never
a
let
down
pours
a
clear
crisp
orange
amber
with
huge
foamy
off
white
head
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
good
carbonation

light
bready
malts
barley
faint
light
citrus
of

a
creamy
pale
taste
is
wonderful
never
have
i
tasted
so
much
flavour
in
a
plae
ale
big
on
a
malt
backbone
but
balanced
well
from
the
barley
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
tasty
and
drinkable

not

fan

i
may
get
sick
of
it
after
a
few
a
beer
i
do
not
shy
from
buying
frequently
one
of
my
top
10
pale
ales
d
an
extremely
drinkable
classic
apa
would
work
extremely
well
as
a

plenty
of

pine
and

are
also

i
could

several
more

330
ml

colour
with
a
thin
head
with
not
much

and
not
much

smell
of
hops
something
like
cheese
rind
and
pine
medium
boyd
it
holds
well
in
the
mouth
where
i
feel
hops
citrus
spices
pepper
and
caramel
its
the
first
sierra
nevada
i
have
a
chance
to
taste
and
i
can
say
im
not
dissappointed
at
all
i
wouldnt
mind
to
drink
some
of
them
any
day
im
have
always
lov
ed
this
beer
but
hadnt
had
one
in
ages
just
picked
up
a
sixer
and
am
remembering
why
i
am
so
fond
of
sierra
nevada
nice
orangetan
body
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
and
taste
are
a
wondeful
balance
of
gentle
hops
and
solid
malts
this
is
still
the
best
apa
for
me
its
not
too
viscous
and
not
too
thin
and
the
taste
lingers
just
long
enough
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
i
have
many
times
its
a
classic
for
a
reason
this
is
a
solid
allaround
allamerican
pale
ale
pours
a
subdued
light
orange
and
had
some
decent
lacing
smelled
of
some
hops
but
pretty
silent
in
the
smell
department
tasted
of
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
a
great
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
great
unpretentious
and
drinkable
apa
overall
great
beer
i
feel
bad
drinking
this
with
5
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
also
spotted
on
draught
at
allbarone
in
canary
wharf
london
d
incredibly
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
refreshing
very
tasty
perhaps
the
best
widely
available
beer
around
d
the
quintessential
apa
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
many
others
rate
this
beer
very
highly
and
i
quite
agree
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
or
simply
a
great
beverage
of
any
type
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
savor
but
not
so
much
it
needs
to
be
chewed
i
could
sip
this
and
luxuriate
in
each
sip
or
quaff
this
to
quench
my
thirst
from
heat
or
exertion
or
both
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
and
if
you
have
never
tried
it
you
gotta
get
your
hands
on
one
soon
d
i
can
have
one
and
be
happy
or
down
a
couple
and
savour
the
flavour
a
great
session
brew
d
extremely
drinkable
and
affordable
why
drink
bud
or

this
is
around

my
millerlol
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
that
i
normally
always
have
in
the
fridge
for
the
price
you
cant
really
beat
it
pretty
drinkable
and
worth
having
again

very
drinkable
the

abv
makes
it
just
low
enough
in
alcohol
to
drink
for
longer
periods
of
time
a
classic
go
to
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
decent
goto
brew
but
it
isnt
great
in
quantity
because
it
really
seems
to
dry
the
palate
quite
a
bit
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
craftwise
i
feel
like
there
should
be
a
sixth
rating
category
for
this
beer
nostalgia
if
i
could
id
certainly
give
it
a
5
here
i
see
this
beer
often
in
various
beer
stores
so
i
figured
it
has
to
be
okno
way
it
can
be
bad
for
that
price
righti
just
bought
a
sixer
just
in
case
it
backfired
and
im
glad
i
did
appearance
looked
good
to
mesmelled
of
casual
ale
now
being
that
is
was
out
of
a
green
bottle
i
figured
it
might
taste
a
little
tartyskunkylittle
did
i
know
my
first
gulp
i
was
shocked
i
thought
it
may
have
gone
bad
or
a
bad
batch
dude
this
stuff
tasted
rotton
didnt
get
better
as
drinking
went
on
neither
every
gulp
was
a
bad
experiancei
was
confused
why
it
is
so
highly
reviewed
i
was
sure
it
was
a
bad
batchso
some
time
later
im
at
this
bar
and
had
it
on
tap
i
figured
id
give
it
a
second
chance
bad
move
even
worse
second
time
cause
i
paid
4
bucks
for
one
anyway
long
story
short
drinkability
a
zero
d
distinctive
american
refreshing
and
complex
enough
to
spark
your
interest
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
is
an
old
stand
by
its
ontap
everywhere
so
the
ace
in
the
hole
factor
is
a
plus
i
like
that
it
is
well
rounded
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
have
a
few
of
this
time
around
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
with
two
fingers
of
head
the
retention
isnt
as
good
as
celebration
but
still
pretty
good
the
color
is
orangecopper
i
smell
hops
malt
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
is
a
good
amount
of
hop
presence
for
a
pale
ale
great
body
to
this
beer
and
the
balance
of
hops
and
malts
makes
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
all
night
paired
with
some
great
music
d
would
create
some
mighty
fine
beer
goggles
d
very
drinkable
pale
i
like
that
a
beer
like
this
is
so
incredibly
popular
my
go
to
beer
when
the
pickings
are
not
right
you
cant
go
wrong
with
sierra
nevada
they
just
dont
make
bad
beers
will
find
in
most
stores
or
bars
even
places
that
typically
just
sell
bud
or
coors
in
my
opinion
its
what
all
pale
ales
are
judged
against
poured
into
a
english
pint
sized
bass
glass
nice
looking
ale
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
creamy
textured
tan
collar
head
retained
well
floral
hop
bouquet
with
an
earthy
mustiness
on
the
nose
tastes
floral
and
herbal
up
front
not
too
hoppy
some
graininess
balances
it
out
with
a
nice
malt
presense
not
shy
with
hops
but
not
too
hoppy
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
them
feels
oily
slick
going
down
resiny
hoppy
oil
and
has
a
fullish
creamy
medium
body
just
a
little
bite
from
carbonation
but
for
the
most
part
quite
smooth
drinkability
spot
on
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
american
pale
all
credit
is
due
for
this
old
soldier
who
helped
lead
the
initial
charge
but
in
comparison
to
current
competition
somewhat
uninspiring
dit
doesnt
get
any
worse
than
the
initial
taste
but
it
doesnt
get
any
better
ive
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
beer
but
i
was
really
let
down
this
is
nothing
special
and
doesnt
beat
the
other
commonly
found
beers
pale
ales
are
not
my
preference
but
from
an
objective
point
of
view
i
can
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
it
is
not
overly
hoppy
or
bitter
as
many
others
tend
to
be
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
id
certainly
have
another
could
drink
this
most
of
the
night
till
i
needed

great
beer
snpa
is
classic
i
used
to
drink
it
all
of
the
time
but
there
are
still
a
number
of
pale
ales
i
perfer
still
this
is
a
beer
that
everyone
must
try
at
least
once
to
all
my
nor
cal
friends
be
thankful
for
this
amazingly
cheap
satisfying
beer
to
everyone
who
has
to
stretch
to
find
it
do
it
and
enjoy
its
a
good
goto
pale
ale
but
isnt
my
favorite
however
quality
wise
its
right
up
there
and
quite
worthy
12oz

pours
a
slightly
cloudy
medium
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
good
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
hops
malt
cereal
and
a
slight
citrus
taste
is
a
crisp
hop
taste
with
a
nice
amount
of
grains
to
it
good
amount
of
malt
flavor
as
well
orange
peel
finish
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
drinkable
beers
around
decided
to
order
an
old
reliable
and
try
this
one
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
pours
a
beautiful
superclear
deep
gold
with
a
thick
very
sticky
offwhite
head
smells
like
hoppy
and
malty
goodness
excellent
malt
on
this
one
tight
and
sweet
suitable
for
the
moderate
and
excellent
hop
bitterness
very
good
balance
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
important
best
american
beers
drinkability
too
bitter
for
me
not
balanced
will
not
try
again
might
not
even
finish
the
whole
bottle
this
is
comparable
to
the
other
exceptional
pale
ales
out
there
highly
recommended
if
you
are
a
fan
of
these
ales
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
yellow
with
a
hint
of
orange
big
foamy
white
head
that
takes
until
the
last
few
mouthfuls
to
disappear
lots
of
sticky
lacings
taste
and
aroma
is
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
hops
creamy
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
this
5
gallon
keg
is
not
gonna
last
long
thanks
sierra
nevada
never
bothered
to
review
this
beer
considering
every
place
everywhere
has
it
so
i
always
just
tell
myself
ill
do
it
next
time
well
its
finally
next
time
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
mediumlarge
white
head
that
slowly
gets
smaller
but
hangs
around
for
a
while
smell
is
a
mellow
wellbalanced
citrus
hop
scent
with
a
tad
bit
of
yeast
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
just
as
well
balanced
with
a
nice
balancing
of
the
hops
and
malts
this
beer
is
definitely
my
goto
beer
at
restaurants
simply
because
every
place
has
it
one
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
to
it
but
nothing
even
close
to
the
bite
an
ipa
should
have
good
representation
of
an
american
pale
ale
drinkability
is
very
high
d
really
really
easy
drinker
definitely
a
good
to
staple
beer
here
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
and
it
is
easy
to
find
taste
though
is
much
improved
with
a
very
good
bread
finish
that
is
subtle
really
good
finish
on
this
beer
giving
just
enough
hops
and
maltbreadbiscuity
chew
to
feel
decent
easily
drinkable
with
a
good
mouthfeel
that
isnt
too
wet
and
is
considerably
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
pours
into
a
golden
colored
brew
that
has
a
white
head
with
excellent
retention
decent
carbonation
and
very
very
good
lacing
that
clings
nicely
to
the
side
of
my
beer
mug
the
smell
is
of
citrus
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
is
a
citrus
taste
at
first
followed
by
some
malts
and
hops
it
has
a
citrus
after
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
creamy
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
crisp
clean
finish
this
crisp
clean
finish
also
makes
the
beer
a
nice
drinkable
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
does
have
a
nice
hoppy
finish
to
it
and
it
is
worth
trying
for
those
that
like
this
style
of
beer
however
a
better
beer
to
try
in
this
style
is
michigan

mackinac
pale

12
oz

with
a
nice
foamy
long

with
some

is
grapefruit
spicy

with
a
long
dry
pleasant
finish
medium
crisp

just
great
everywhere
available
pale
ale
my
default
choice
for
a
refreshing
bitter
ale
when
im
not
inclined
to
experiment
d
very
drinkable
on
any
occasion
deasily
a
session
beer
that
goes
well
with
every
situation
most
certainly
will
buy
again
drinkability
is
fairly
high
this
beer
tastes
better
than
your
average
macrobrew
but
its
not
a
knockout
punch
overall
a
definite
session
beer
but
one
that
might
not
be
worth
sessioning
due
to
the
general
lack
of
character
what
can
i
say
this
is
the
classic
apa
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
smells
and
tastes
like
the
classic
brew
that
it
is
loads
of
pine
and
grapefruit
with
a
dry
malt
profile
that
threatens
to
run
away
and
hide
altogether
before
returning
with
some
light
sweetness
midswallow
a
hefty
bitterness
that
really
makes
this
a
borderline
ipa
and
the
hoppy
superior
of
many
brews
labeled
as
such
finishes
a
little
juicy
a
little
sticky
and
with
a
distinct
longing
for
another
sip
great
beer
serving
type
bottle
in
my
book
this
is
one
of
the
classic
american
craft
beers
simple
enough
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
masses
yet
creative
enough
to
stay
interesting
this
was
one
of
my
early
craft
beers
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
favorite
for
hoppy
beer
lovers
and
still
drinkable
for
those
that
are
malt
fans
very
well
balance
makes
this
beer
top
notch
5
6
abv
make
this
a
bit
high
to
be
sessionable
but
the
whole
package
is
so
darned
smooth
that
id
be
tempted
to
put
these
away
one
after
another
its
relative
lowcost
and
highavailability
for
a
craft
brew
only
sweetens
the
deal
it
might
be
the
most
wellbalanced
brew
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
fours
across
the
board
cheers
drinkability
very
drinkable
ale
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
whether
they
are
hop
heads
or
not
overall
a
classic
brew
and
a
mainstay
for
any
refrigerator
its
not
the
most
memorable
beer
but
it
is
definitely
not
forgettable
in
my
opinion
snpa
is
and
always
will
be
the
beer
that
defines
this
genre
a
clean
drinking
brew
nice
hop
kick
and
malt
backbone
good
one
to
open
drink
and
repeat
a
very
nice
ale
that
compares
to
anchors
liberty
ale
not
over
powering
but
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
has
a
soft
smooth
amber
color
and
a
slightly
spicy
taste
a
nice
ale
that
goes
down
nice
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
average
head
i
like
this
one
very
much
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
quality
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
for
just
about
everyone
dont
dismiss
this
just
because
its
been
around
forever
and
so
many
great
beers
have
been
produced
since
its
release
to
me
its
amazing
its
remained
so
consistently
great
with
such
a
wide
distribution
long

drinkability
im
not
a
fan
of
this
pale
ale
the
review
for
this
beer
has
been
done
with
the
last
beer
from
my
six
pack
typically
a
six
pack
in
my
frige
barely
lasts
four
days
but
this
beer
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
over
two
weeks
the
off
flavor
of
the
pickle
is
a
huge
turn
off
this
beer
is
also
trying
to
be
too
much
for
a
pale
ale
m
and
d
very
drinkable
good
all
around
mouthfeel
carbonation
hoppy
aftertaste
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
excellent
all
around
beer
for
any
occasion
relatively
inexpensive
good
easy
to
find
solid
mouthfeel
appropriate
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
to
have
this
so
regularly
as
an
option
in
most
all
areas
i
travel
pours
golden
amber
with
a
nice
white
creamy
long
lasting
head
aroma
of
floral
hops
citrus
taste
is
hops
some
citrus
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
med
body
with
good
carbonation
nicely
balanced
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
pale
ale
went
great
with
the
burger
d
nice
beer
to
have
its
a
very
clean
crisp
beer
id
even
call
it
refreshing
its
nice
to
see
a
good
craft
beer
that
is
widely
available
had
in
bottle
and
maybe
its
just
me
but
it
was
much
more
bitter
than
i
expected
the
bite
didnt
seem
to
be
as
balanced
as
others
here
have
mentioned
i
tried
three
to
be
sure
but
on
my
palate
it
was
less
than
satisfactory
pours
great
looks
great
but
reminds
me
too
much
of
heineken
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
would
try
again
or
maybe
i
can
find
it
on
draft
to
be
sure
drinkability
having
another
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
yellow
hints
and
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
pine
hops
and
a
gingerbread
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
same
as
the
aroma
a
bit
more
abrasive
on
the
hops
but
backed
nicely
with
sweet
malt
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfel
with
a
small
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
a
bigger
hop
for
a
pale
but
basic
and
good
a
legendary
beer
in
my
book
if
someone
wants
to
know
what
us
beer
really
tastes
like
aka
the
brits
aussies
belgians
koreans
whoever
give
them
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
draft
version
of
sierra
nevada
i
tried
the
bottle
version
a
year
ago
and
i
wasnt
very
impressed
i
thought
it
was
too
bitter
and
almost
tasteless
this
however
was
the
perfect
balance
of
bitterness
and
hoppiness
in
my
opinion
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
an
overall
b
drinkability
major
props
to
spinrsx
for
his
selection
and
giving
me
this
beer
he
was
right
this
is
a
tremendous
session
beer
offers
everything
youd
expect
in
a
apa
and
more
pretty
much
this
beer
is
classy
please
try
it
if
you
havent
yet
you
might
finish
it
quicker
then
you
think
i
could
drink
this
nonstop
this
is
just
a
tremendous
american
pale
ale
the
beer
world
has
changed
a
lot
since
it
was
introduced
back
in
the
early
80s
and
i
suppose
i
can
understand
it
if
some
people
feel
that
snpa
has
been
surpassed
by
hoppier
more
sensationalistic
brews
but
damn
this
tastes
amazing
sierra
nevada
changed
the
brewing
world
and
this
is
the
beer
that
did
it
if
you
cant
dig
it
its
your
loss
time
to
review
one
of
the
greatgreat
granddaddies
of
craft
brewage
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
4
glorious
fingers
of
spongy
white
head
that
recedes
pretty
quickly
niiice
lacing
though
nice
golden
amber
color
smells
so
familiar
cascade
in
the
house
floral
citrus
classic
full
bodied
floral
and
medium
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
skunk
dry
finish
good
carbonation
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
planet
d
something
about
this
beer
makes
me
want
another
12
oz
just
isnt
enough
of
this
goodness
an
easily
drinkable
beer
in
any
situation
all
of
the
flavors
are
very
up
front
making
for
a
beer
that
can
be
truly
enjoyed
without
lots
of
thought
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
a
beer
that
i
consistently
buy
it
is
affordable
easily
available
and
tasty
this
beer
is
chocked
full
of
grapefruity
cascade
hops
in
the
aroma
and
taste
i
also
smell
some
caramel
and
toasted
grain
in
the
nose
the
malt
contribution
is
pretty
limited
though
there
is
a
little
doughy
sweetness
but
the
beer
finishes
pretty
clean
and
dry
the
beer
has
a
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
and
has
enough
mouthfeel
carry
the
flavor
and
make
for
a
good
drink
this
beer
holds
up
to
the
best
of
them
and
actually
is
in
the
winners
circle
of
the
best
of
them
pours
a
maple
extremely
clear
brown
with
a
nice
thick
head
smells
like
it
tastes
fresh
cascade
hops
and
lots
of
them
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
appearance
suggests
still
on
the
light
side
nice
carbonation
this
beer
is
how
sierra
nevada
took
over
pours
a
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
pretty
sticky
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
is
all
about
the
american
c
hops
with
some
excellent
citrus
notes
throughout
the
taste
is
slightlybitter
citrus
hops
with
a
very
mild
malt
presence
in
the
background
not
excessively
bitter
but
does
the
job
right
drinkability
is
really
high
as
this
is
perhaps
the
most
classic
of
all
the
craft
beers
drink
could
have
had
more
than
1
i
tell
you
that
too
bad
for
the
1hr
half
drive
home
and
the
fact
there
was
none
left
may
have
to
run
to
the
store
to
pick
one
up
mediumbodymedium
carbed
mouthfeel
high
drinkability
score
easily
a
session
type
of
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
its
not
too
much
money
great
stuff
havent
had
it
in
months
i
think
i
need
to
get
some
more
d
could
definitely
knock
back
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
a
very
solid
tasty
beer
wish
i
had
tried
this
beer
sooner
seems
like
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
nice
chicken
or
fish
dinner
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
is
a
fantastic
highquality
brew
d
infinitely
drinkable
absolutely
delicious
for
my
first
pale
ale
im
very
impressed
not
only
is
this
an
american
classic
but
its
a
good
way
to
get
into
craft
brews
definitely
going
to
go
for
it
again
pours
a
dark
golden
hue
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
bit
of
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
a
mellow
slightly
hoppy
deliciousness
its
body
is
on
the
light
side
and
its
drinkability
has
been
proven
time
and
again
not
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
but
one
of
the
best
and
at
its
price
and
availability
it
really
cant
be
beat
an
american
classic
poured
into
a
standard
ale
glass
this
time
it
was
the
twenty
four
ounce
version
quite
good
for
an
extended
sitting
the
inimitable
resiny
pine
character
of
this
ale
also
serves
to
remind
me
that
it
tastes
as
good
as
its
aroma
the
yeast
strain
works
magic
and
i
have
heard
the
legend
that
this
strain
originally
came
from
ballantine
who
knows
all
i
know
is
this
remains
the
yearround
flagship
brand
of
sierra
nevada
and
rightfully
so
even
though
is
pretty
cold
out
and
is
in
mid
oct
its
still
a
good
choice
if
your
looking
for
a
light
tasting
pale
ale
not
bad
at
all
d
this
has
and
always
will
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
is
both
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
and
californian
beer
as
well
as
sierras
best
beer
obviously
all
my
opinions
i
love
the
simplicity
of
it
the
straight
forwardness
and
that
it
has
a
similar
taste
to
all
the
other
sierra
beers
but
is
the
one
that
really
stands
out
among
the
rest
also
i
love
that
its
nearly
everywhereits
my
go
to
beer
when
im
at
a
bar
or
restaurant
with
a
limited
selection
a
great
alternative
to
the
macro
tripe
these
places
often
have
to
offer
pretty
good
beer
ive
had
this
many
times
before
but
just
decided
to
rate
it
while
enjoying
a
6pack
during
a
football
game
definitely
a
good
beer
for
any
sort
of
occasion
this
is
probably
the
best
widely
available
pale
ale
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
that
can
be
found
just
about
anywhere
highly
recommended
poured
it
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
cast
a
golden
orange
brew
with
a
full
beige
crown
full
body
nice
carbonation
hops
citrus
fruits
pine
and
caramel
on
the
palate
is
fairly
the
same
as
on
the
aroma
crisp
refreshing
starts
up
a
little
dryish
but
then
the
hops
and
malts
are
loose
and
they
linger
on
until
the
aftertaste
in
which
the
malts
subside
and
they
get
replaced
by
a
hoopy
fruity
aftertatse
nice
drinkability
and
superb
balance
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
fairly
average
d
easy
to
drink
and
good
all
around
beer
has
everything
i
expect
for
a
beer
but
not
much
more
still
for
the
price
and
availability
this
beer
is
more
or
less
the
craft
beer
drinkers
lifeboat
id
have
to
say
that
all
things
considered
this
is
my
favorite
beer
no
matter
what
else
is
in
my
fridge
there
is
always
at
least
a
few
sierra
nevada
pale
ales
lurking
in
amongst
them
drinkability
very
good
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
pints
24
oz
is
perfect
but
doesnt
that
often
define
a
well
crafted
beverage
very
good
pale
ale
a
nice
solid
little
brew
to
have
with
a
meal
drink
well
my
friends
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
basically
always
in
stock
fairly
cheap
perfect
if
you
dont
want
to
drop
a
lot
of
cash
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
easy
to
drink
overall
my
favorite
beer
hand
down
i
try
to
drink
this
beer
as
much
as
possible
absolutely
love
it
this
beer
is
perfect
an
insanely
drinkable
beer
and
a
staple
in
my
regular
line
up
i
get
the
impression
that
this
is
a
slightly
older
bottle
as
there
is
usually
more
of
a
hop
presence
will
need
to
be
reviewed
again
when
i
know
im
drinking
a
fresher
bottle
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
sturdy
cream
colored
cap
small
streams
of
bubbles
and
good
retention
head
eventually
recedes
in
a
rain
drop
type
of
pattern
to
form
a
thin
layer
of
foam
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
peaches
and
apricots
with
a
sturdy
caramel
malt
backbone
the
flavor
is
almost
identical
to
the
aroma
grapefruit
up
front
with
soft
peach
and
apricot
as
the
caramel
malt
comes
through
in
the
middle
before
a
moderately
bitter
finish
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
spot
on
this
is
highly
drinkable
a
nice
balance
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
winning
out
to
not
overly
assault
the
palate
a
staple
in
the
beer
landscape
the
appearance
is
clear
and
pale
gold
when
poured
it
has
a
nice
creamy
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
citrusy
and
piney
it
also
has
some
lingering
herbal
notes
that
add
to
the
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
and
smooth
hss
great
taste
and
easy
drinkability
this
is
a
very
solid
pale
ale
pretty
much
sets
the
standard
pours
darker
than
i
expected
for
a
pale
ale
its
a
transparent
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
very
crisp
and
fresh
smelling
taste
is
great
starts
with
citrus
and
pine
hops
followed
by
understated
sweet
malts
i
know
its
bitter
but
it
doesnt
taste
that
bitter
quite
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
perfect
carbonation
is
just
right
too
i
usually
buy
12oz
bottles
when
i
try
beers
today
i
got
the
large
bottle
i
think
it
was
24oz
and
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
market
and
the
reason
sierra
nevada
has
been
around
30
years
a
very
approachable
pale
ale
for
newbies
i
like
cascade
hops
and
their
floralcitrus
notes
top
of
my
list
for
a
very
accessible
apas
easy
to
find
always
very
much
enjoyed
affordable
8
per
sixer
excellent
apa
and
a
steal
at
the
always
consistent
affordable
pric
in
time
you
may
develop
a
palate
for
extra
bitter
beers
like
snpa
however
let
me
reiterate
that
this
beer
should
be
avoided
when
youre
starting
to
try
out
different
varieties
of
beer
happy
drinking
i
have
had
sierra
nevada
before
and
they
continue
to
impress
me
definitely
a
brewery
that
i
am
glad
to
find
is
popular
theres
nothing
like
a
good
pale
ale
and
i
would
consider
this
beer
to
be
the
original
american
pale
ale
it
has
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
great
head
retention
and
a
very
balanced
hoppy
kick
also
the
malt
comes
through
quite
nicely
and
isnt
overrun
by
the
hops
a
great
session
brew
d
i
like
this
beer
and
its
widely
stocked
so
its
easy
to
get
so
you
dont
have
to
settle
for
one
of
the
big
boys
over
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
oh
hell
yeah
not
a
hop
bomb
perfect
gateway
beer
for
a
noncraft
drinker
super
easy
drinking
great
beer
dthe
most
drinkable
in
my
opinion
their
other
brews
never
disappoint
either
but
this
one
just
seems
to
be
an
american
classic
i
love
going
to
the
brewery
in
chico
too
always
great
surprises
on
tap
mouthfeeldrinkability
slightlyheavierthanlight
body
with
nice
carbonation
drinkable
beer
that
has
more
flavor
than
a
lot
of
the
crap
you
will
find
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
one
of
the
founding
american
craft
beers
very
flavorful
and
balanced
beer
a
really
good
apa
a
solid
goto
beer
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
one
although
its
not
particularly
exciting
in
many
ways
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
beer
and
i
always
seem
to
have
some
in
my
beer
fridge
just
a
terrific
go
to
beer
i
pulled
some
out
today
to
watch
the
colts
game
and
figured
that
i
would
check
out
how
i
reviewed
it
to
see
how
my
opinion
of
it
had
changed
and
to
my
surprise
i
had
never
taken
the
time
to
review
this
great
beer
cant
go
wrong
with
snpa
this
beer
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
and
i
often
use
it
to
introduce
beer
drinkers
to
real
craft
beers
usually
with
great
results
this
beer
rightfully
deserves
its
status
as
one
of
americas
craft
beer
ambassadors
i
used
to
be
a
great
fan
of
bass
pale
ale
but
now
i
have
a
new
favorite
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
really
good
apa
m
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
lack
of
carbonation
6
pack
for
6
99
at
the
local
gas
station
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
smells
of
hops
and
some
citrus
very
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
aste
is
very
complex
with
some
bittering
but
not
extremly
hoppy
you
dont
realize
how
strong
this
beer
is
until
youve
had
23
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
but
finally
decided
to
review
it
sn
pale
ale
is
usually
the
go
to
beer
when
i
go
to
said
gas
station
the
only
other
good
beer
they
offer
is
bridgeport
hop
czar
o
it
all
started
here
for
me
and
it
will
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
not
perfect
but
so
inviting
to
a
wide
range
of
palates
there
is
a
reason
they
are
so
highly
regarded
the
predominant
taste
is
not
surprisingly
citrusfloral
hoppiness
however
they
are
not
among
the
strongest
ive
tasted
in
this
style
of
beer
theyre
at
a
pretty
medium
level
of
bitterness
throughout
the
swallow
theres
a
creamy
malt
presence
that
sits
under
the
hoppiness
the
taste
of
this
beer
doesnt
really
change
for
me
from
initial
taste
to
after
the
swallow
citrus
hops
with
an
undercurrent
of
malt
and
thats
it
but
it
certainly
works
its
drinkable
and
thats
part
of
why
this
beer
is
considered
one
of
the
best
examples
of
apas
on
the
market
tastesugared
ruby
red
grapefruit
leafy
hop
bite
creamy
buttered
biscuit
and
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
to
the
finish
very
flavorful
and
well
balanced
pale
that
drinks
like
an
ipa
the
definitive
american
pale
ale
a
must
for
all
craft
beer
lovers
a
classic
has
to
be
one
of
my
favoret
pale
ales
i
have
ever
drank
the
taste
is
great
you
could
really
taste
the
hopps
and
taste
so
good
nice
and
cold
this
makes
me
want
to
go
to
711
and
buy
a
6
pack
lol
theres
nothing
like
drinking
a
sierra
nevada
in
a
open
glass
just
go
pick
on
up
youll
end
up
really
liking
them
bright
floral
notes
extremely
drinkable
and
among
micros
probably
the
cadillac
of
its
type
the
taste
and
mouth
are
beyond
compare
the
folks
at
sierra
nevada
have
this
as
their
flagship
brew
for
a
reason
for
anyone
who
has
not
experienced
this
it
is
absolutely
highly
recommended
overall
a
classic
goto
american
pale
ale
often
considered
the
archetype
of
apas
while
its
definitely
not
the
only
good
apa
out
there
its
still
one
of
the
better
ones
and
one
of
many
great
offerings
from
sn
if
you
like
this
one
try
sn
torpedo
too
sierra
nevada
appears
transparent
yellowish
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
that
completely
coats
the
glass
in
lacing
a
well
balanced
brew
with
hop
flavors
in
the
forefront
really
drinkable
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
the
carbonation
level
is
spot
on
the
flavor
is
simple
but
well
done
i
have
has
this
beer
all
over
the
country
and
found
it
to
be
very
consistent
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
around
when
you
want
something
light
and
dont
want
to
pillage
your
cellar
drinkability
is
fairly
high
feel
this
is
a
pretty
nicely
balanced
brew
the
further
down
the
glass
it
gets
the
better
i
think
this
beer
tastes
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
bubbly
orange
with
a
thin
barely
there
head
aroma
was
the
same
crisp
citrus
hops
i
expect
in
a
sierra
nevada
brew
along
with
some
crisp
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
smooth
and
refreshing
this
one
certainly
lives
up
to
its
status
as
a
textbook
american
pale
ale
forgot
how
awesome
this
guy
was
a
paipa
hybrid
in
my
book
havent
had
one
of
these
in
a
while
but
am
very
glad
i
went
back
for
some
more
absolutely
one
of
the
most
important
beers
period
never
a
bad
choice
never
reluctant
to
drink
it
either
this
is
the
pale
ale
that
all
other
pale
ales
are
graded
against
i
have
yet
to
find
one
better
also
good
when
i
dont
want
to
break
the
bank
but
want
something
consistently
tasty
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
a
heavy
brew
refreshing
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
around
a
campfire
or
while
watching
a
football
game
good
example
of
an
american
unfiltered
pale
ale
very
drinkable
d
id
buy
6ers
of
this
stuff
every
weekend
if
it
were
available
ill
be
sure
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
because
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
nicely
balanced
hop
malt
combination
and
very
smooth
d
very
nice
could
drink
these
all
day
good
body
with
good
medium
carbonation
and
a
relatively
drinkable
beer
at
places
without
great
selection
of
brews
this
and
blue
moon
are
the
standouts
of
the
widely
available
beers
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
just
want
a
nice
flavorful
beer
drinks
like
a
standby
to
this
longtime
drinker
firsttime
reviewer
snpa
is
a
classic
thats
dependable
when
craft
beer
is
scarce
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
can
drink
many
off
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
with
a
nice
foamy
rocky
thick
white
head
that
slowly
receded
and
left
nice
lacing
the
length
of
the
beer
the
color
is
a
nice
clean
light
amber
with
small
trace
of
yeasty
sediment
smellis
of
toasty
biscuity
malt
with
a
strong
citrusy
grass
like
hop
ovetone
taste
is
sweet
biscuit
malt
up
front
with
clean
citrus
hop
and
fuit
with
a
nice
clean
dry
finish
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
and
very
smooth
drinikability
is
very
high
on
this
beer
this
is
my
go
to
beer
during
the
summer
months
great
apa
very
nicely
balanced
beer
very
drinkable
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
ive
been
drinking
this
for
years
and
have
always
marvelled
at
how
such
a
widely
available
beer
can
be
so
consistently
tasty
but
it
is
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
which
really
capture
me
that
citrus
chewy
oily
hoppy
quality
once
the
beer
hits
the
tongue
never
fails
to
activate
even
the
most
stubborn
taste
buds
sure
it
isnt
a
240
hour
ipa
but
the
balanced
lingering
bitterness
and
reasonable
alcohol
gives
the
brewer
no
where
to
hide
faults
just
as
well
that
ive
never
found
any
worth
mentioning
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
is
hard
to
have
just
one
so
easy
to
find
and
enjoy
and
so
rewarding
the
consensus
is
growing
but
i
still
dont
think
it
gets
the
respect
it
deserves
drinkability
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
its
easy
to
drink
tastes
great
feels
great
and
its
just
a
fantastic
standard
i
love
this
beer
when
i
go
to
the
beer
store
to
buy
beer
and
i
cant
make
a
decision
i
always
pick
this
it
does
what
i
want
in
the
right
amounts
kind
of
a
fighter
this
baby
so
drinkable
yet
so
direct
a
statement
neither
overdone
nor
cheap
god
bless
sierra
nevada
perhaps
the
most
solid
brewery
in
all
the
world
unstoppable
beautiful
ale
will
definitively
get
it
again
d
quite
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
pale
ale
from
the
boys
at
chico
a
big
improvement
on
their
porter
i
just
had
also
i
appreciate
this
beer
more
than
when
i
first
tried
it
about
5
years
ago
like
their
porter
it
is
still
lacking
somewhat
in
the
aromapalate
departments
but
would
take
this
offering
over
the
porter
bottle
nice
golden
slightly
orange
color
with
white
head
citrus
particularly
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
aroma
loaded
with
fresh
hops
flavor
spicey
that
good
bitter
smack
finish
i
used
to
prefer
darker
beers
to
american
pale
ales
but
this
beer
is
the
one
that
changed
my
mind
this
beer
goes
great
with
crawfish
and
pizza
id
buy
this
baby
over
and
over
again
as
an
everyday
drinker
no
doubt
about
it
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
tasty
while
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
highly
hopped
beers
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
does
have
a
fairly
high
bitterness
but
its
not
unpleasant
and
the
hops
give
a
nice
pine
woody
flavor
but
doesnt
become
overpowering
i
could
see
this
beer
being
perfect
for
a
camping
or
canoe
trip
golden
amber
colour
is
inviting
with
some
really
interesting
citrus
aromas
very
well
balanced
the
hops
arent
overdone
which
makes
it
easily
drinkable
but
still
interesting
enough
to
savour
fair
amount
of
carbonation
gives
a
zesty
feel
a
renowned
american
ipa
for
good
reason
i
found
this
beer
to
be
super
bitter
i
do
like
beers
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
this
definitely
seemed
overpowering
it
wasnt
as
crisp
as
i
expected
and
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
in
combination
with
the
beer
i
traded
it
for
something
new
and
couldnt
finish
the
first
one
golden
amber
with
thin
offwhite
head
crystal
clear
leaving
lots
of
lacing
nose
of
earthy
woodsy
skunky
deliciousness
palate
is
crisp
and
bitter
right
off
the
bat
woody
hops
piney
but
not
a
lot
of
citrus
some
pink
grapefruit
or
grapefruit
zest
anyway
bitter
bitter
bitter
but
somehow
insanely
drinkable
can
drink
this
all
night
i
think
its
because
its
so
clear
sure
its
not
a
hard
to
find
or
hopped
up
monster
but
anyone
looking
into
geeting
into
craft
beer
or
just
chilling
having
a
nice
regular
craft
brew
can
do
no
wrong
here
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
big
sticky
yeasty
head
has
strong
citrus
and
floral
hop
smells
with
yeasty
smells
too
mmm
strong
hopforward
ale
with
sweet
notes
strong
carbonation
in
this
moderate
bodied
beer
i
drink
tons
of
this
poop
its
great
finger
and
a
half
white
head
medium
dissipation
with
above
average
lacing
clear
amber
body
multiple
streams
of
carbonation
pretty
big
hop
presence
in
the
nose
floral
a
a
bit
of
citrus
and
resin
significant
hop
bill
balanced
by
caramelcrystal
malts
taste
mirrors
nose
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
hoppy
apas
youll
find
bordering
the
ipa
category
smooth
clean
mouthfeel
with
good
effervescence
a
hint
of
stickiness
tres
drinkable
my
buddy
called
this
beer
ubiquitous
and
for
good
reason
a
standby
whenever
you
travel
you
know
this
is
gonna
taste
good
recommended
12
ounce
bottle
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
maybe
the
one
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
10
years
ago
or
so
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
nice
fizzy
white
head
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
aroma
is
light
citrus
and
grassy
hops
with
some
nice
caramel
malts
in
the
background
first
taste
is
both
familiar
yet
arresting
at
the
same
time
just
a
brilliant
brew
theres
this
great
oily
and
piney
hop
character
in
the
body
and
in
the
finish
thats
played
out
perfectly
by
the
sweetness
in
the
malt
body
wonderful
semisweet
finish
ive
been
getting
back
into
pale
ales
recently
and
this
beer
is
probably
the
perfect
example
of
what
im
looking
for
in
the
style
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
tasting
it
again
for
the
first
time
ive
fallen
back
in
love
with
it
all
over
again
everything
in
this
brew
is
finetuned
to
perfection
there
is
definitely
a
reason
its
so
widely
seen
as
the
standardbearer
for
pale
ales
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
great
session
brew
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
followed
quickly
by
a
mild
grapefruit
bitterness
nothing
too
assertive
but
wellbalanced
light
and
easydrinking
the
hop
profile
wasnt
quite
as
lemony
as
sierras
summerfest
but
this
one
was
equally
suited
to
a
summer
evening
the
body
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
id
actually
prefer
a
little
more
carbonation
but
this
is
certainly
respectable
prost
theres
a
reason
this
beer
is
the
benchmark
for
the
style
totally
smashes
the
old
world
definition
of
pale
ale
a
surprisingly
good
beer
when
it
sits
ive
had
this
before
and
it
wasnt
so
promising
this
has
been
sitting
around
for
about
six
month
and
spread
the
hop
range
nice
citrus
not
astringent
but
a
nice
mild
apple
and
grape
along
with
the
floral
clean
palate
in
the
finish
although
the
carbonation
is
sufficent
the
malt
is
too
lean
for
the
yeast
quality
and
it
has
a
fingernail
yeast
flavor
although
its
extremely
easy
to
find
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
feel
it
has
incredible
potential
for
food
pairings
i
would
pair
this
with
seafood
and
some
chicken
dishes
summary
this
is
the
one
beer
that
really
got
me
into
american
craft
beer
absolutely
one
of
my
favorite
ales
this
beer
provides
really
fine
balance
between
the
malts
and
ends
with
great
hop
bitterness
everything
one
would
want
in
an
ale
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
american
pale
ale
an
extrememly

drinkability
the
beautiful
golden
color
with
an
intimidating
head
and
the
complex
flavors
presented
in
the
taste
create
an
absolutely
excellent
pale
ale
this
will
be
kept
in
my
fridge
as
often
as
it
is
sold
d
with
or
wo
food
this
is
the
classic
american
you
cant
go
wrong
with
because
of
its
versatility
with
different
cuisines
and
crisp
refreshing
drinkability
i
am
reviewing
this
at
a
party
this
has
a
a
nice
cascade
hop
smell
with
a
nice
pale
malt
back
end
citrusy
and
spicy
orange
peels
and

good
solid
amber
colr
decent
heas
great
on
a
summer
day
its
a
good
beer
with
good
drinkability
all
around
solid
the
quintessential
example
of
an
apa
snpa
is
simple
yet
brilliant
and
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
in
general
the
perfect
pale
ale
for
a
hophead
as
well
as
a
great
stepping
stone
to
the
world
of
hoppy
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
good
very
balanced
pale
ale
and
one
that
i
enjoy
drinking
in
a
number
of
situations
a
classic
of
american
craft
brewing
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
a
great
example
of
the
style
would
be
a
terrific
goto
beer
if
we
would
ever
get
this
in
ontario
that
is
great
pick
up
drinkability
is
okay
for
me
maybe
i
was
spoiled
by
having
nugget
nectar
first
but
the
bitterness
was
just
a
bit
unbalanced
at
least
in
my
admittedly
inexperienced
opinion
it
was
by
no
means
overpowering
just
a
little
too
present
in
the
taste
without
much
else
complexity
one
is
all
id
think
id
have
in
a
given
night
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
a
nice
light
summer
drinker
i
love
big
beers
but
if
i
had
to
drink
a
light
style
this
one
might
be
a
way
to
go
good
to
try
if
you
can
bought
a
fresh
12pack
at
the
grocer
store
so
felt
was
a
fair
time
to
finally
review
this
ale
definitely
a
classic
beer
which
for
me
defines
the
pale
ale
style
the
beer
looks
like
a
pale
golden
color
pours
out
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
effervescence
nice
thick
head
and
clinging
lace
from
the
abundance
of
american
hops
there
is
always
some
residual
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
from
the
bottle
fermentation
i
like
this
and
i
try
to
swirl
it
into
my
glass
smells
like
well
hops
and
some
biscuity
maltiness
and
despite
the
strong
presence
of
hops
i
feel
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
to
introduce
the
beer
neophytes
to
the
greatness
of
hops
and
fortunately
is
widely
available
everywhere
god
bless
america
just
new
to
the
beer
market
my
brother
inlaw
bought
me
a
six
pack
of
the
pale
ale
to
try
out
by
far
some
of
the
best
beer
ive
tried
ive
tried
a
few
pale
ales
but
none
quitt
as
good
as
this
brew
would
like
to
try
more
of
the
sierra
nevada
brewing
co
beer
would
highly
reccomand
this
beer
an
allaround
winner
pale
ale
d
i
didnt
have
enough
to
really
tell
on
drinkability
but
i
do
know
that
it
didnt
fill
me
at
all
that
combined
with
5
6
abv
and
i
would
imagine
this
is
a
great
session
beer
if
youre
used
to
the
hops
dthis
is
a
great
alternative
for
fans
of
ipas
who
are
also
looking
to
lower
their
alcohol
intake
carbohydrates
and
calories
while
holding
onto
some
of
the
attributes
that
make
ipas
such
flavorful
beers
its
becoming
increasingly
easy
to
find
across
the
country
which
makes
it
a
beer
staple
for
those
living
in
fringe
areas
with
limited
choice
or
traveling
by
vehicle
i
purchase
a
lot
of
different
quality
beers
over
the
course
of
the
year
but
this
has
become
in
a
sense
my
house
beer
i
would
not
only
buy
it
again
but
have
been
doing
so
for
some
time
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
apas
and
great
for
being
available
anywhere
d
want
hops
but
dont
feel
like
dropping
a
tenspot
on
a
bomber
of
some
tonguewalloping
ultralimited
imperial
this
is
your
fix
always
a
classic
and
available
in
the
average
grocery
stores
of
just
about
every
town
of
any
significance
nowadays
for
me
this
beer
was
bearable
for
about
half
a
glass
and
after
that
i
had
to
struggle
to
drink
it
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
classic
beer
always
enjoyed
d
its
definately
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
one
of
my
choices
for
a
session
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
isnt
familiar
with
pale
ales
or
is
used
to
american
macros
but
its
also
enjoyable
for
a
seasoned
pale
ale
vet
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
great
bottle
conditioned
carbonation
good
hop
presence
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
overdone
this
is
the
beer
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
wanted
to
try
a
pale
ale
for
the
first
time
the
hops
is
a
little
mild
for
my
taste
however
the
smoothness
and
quality
keeps
me
going
back
this
is
just
a
well
put
together
beer
d
very
drinkable
a
midpoint
between
a
session
and
an
ipa
id
reccomend
it
to
timid
macrodrinkers
and
pale
ale
enthusiastes
alike
d
a
decent
choice
for
a
session
beer
and
a
good
choice
for
a
keg
during
a
summer
cookout
i
know
ill
recommend
this
to
any
casual
beer
drinker
not
something
that
amazes
me
by
any
means
but
a
solid
pale
ale
to
be
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
but
not
overly
heavy
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
slightly
below
average
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
goes
down
so
easily
and
is
something
ill
go
back
to
again
and
again
always
a
good
buy
and
so
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
if
i
find
it
in
the
midst
of
the
other
normal
inrestaurantbeers
i
will
drink
it
gladly
enjoy
t
d
its
a
great
standard
for
pale
ale
and
a
bar
for
new
breweries
to
try
and
reach
drinkability
this
is
supposedly
a
classic
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
but
its
a
tad
too
acidic
compared
to
others
ive
had
its
good
but
its
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
d
the
quality
of
this
beer
is
undeniable
sierra
nevada
has
done
a
great
job
of
finding
the
best
and
freshest
ingredients
and
it
shows
its
approaching
on
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
i
imagine
fans
of
hopforward
beers
love
it
in
any
case
its
completely
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
for
any
occasion
overall
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
pretty
good
nothing
spectacular
there
are
definitely
better
ipas
out
there
but
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
d
a
very
solid
brew
and
super
easy
to
drink
i
dont
think
there
is
really
anything
i
can
say
about
this
one
that
hasnt
alredy
been
said
d
such
a
smooth
malty
beverage
you
can
pound
these
all
night
long
one
of
my
favourite
american
pale
ales
highly
recommended
if
i
could
improve
this
beer
and
i
wouldnt
really
try
i
would
like
the
head
to
last
longer
and
lace
better
i
would
prefer
a
more
robust
color
but
arent
those
incredibly
minor
wishes
taste
aroma
mouthfeel
thats
where
the
actions
at
and
thats
where
this
beer
excels
faint
citrus
hop
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
sweet
refreshing
malt
and
the
hops
come
back
around
for
the
finish
to
complete
the
cycle
the
malts
are
top
notch
and
makes
the
beer
incredibly
well
balanced
drinkable
and
well
done
a
classic
american
pale
ale
this
is
sierra
nevadas
flagship
beer
for
a
reason
it
can
be
a
session
beer
or
an
accompaniment
to
a
gourmet
meal
or
pizza
or
burgers
overall
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
im
at
a
barrestaurant
when
they
dont
have
more
intriguing
options
available
this
is
probably
the
best
widely
available
beer
in
america
sierra
nevada
never
disappoints
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
summer
it
always
seems
to
leave
me
feeling
refreshed
but
then
reels
me
back
in
for
a
sip
seconds
later
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
so
crisp
and
flavorful
that
it
goes
down
easily
however
the
primary
properties
of
the
brew
citruspine
notes
make
it
so
it
cant
be
dunked
all
at
once
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
scratch
that
its
the
primary
apa
out
there
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
brew
to
share
with
others
dazzling
in
entering
the
craft
beer
world
im
not
the
first
to
say
that
of
course
carbonation
level
is
good
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
not
much
i
can
say
that
already
hasnt
been
said
a
classic
pleasantly
hopped
pale
ale
that
is
easily
among
the
best
of
its
kind
one
of
the
best
most
legendary
session
beers
im
not
worthy
to
pass
judgment
on
this
ale
which
has
long
stood
as
a
symbol
of
uniquely
american
craft
brewing
let
me
just
add
my
note
of
appreciation
for
this
fine
and
delicious
drink
d
nicely
balanced
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
ipa
is
probably
my
least
liked
beer
style
gasp
however
the
notoverly
bitter
nature
of
sn
pale
alr
made
it
fairly
drinkable
for
me
especially
in
these
hot
summer
days
this
is
a
staple
of
the
ipa
style
nothing
bland
but
nothing
over
the
top
i
most
likely
wont
buy
it
again
due
to
my
style
preferences
but
i
wont
turn
one
down
o
i
highly
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
actually
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
wont
say
what
age
but
now
that
i
actually
know
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
i
can
appreciate
everything
that
is
going
on
with
it
only
suggestions
for
improving
this
beer
based
upon
style
guidelines
would
be
more
in
the
mouthfeel
possibly
more
malt
characterpresence
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
obviously
an
american
classic
ironically
not
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beer
but
a
very
respectable
brew
d
can
drink
this
all
night
thirst
quenching
except
it
makes
you
thirsty
for
another
one
rip
enjoy
d
this
is
a
classic
pale
ale
thats
still
quite
good
it
has
lots
of
hops
but
is
also
decently
balanced
with
malt
it
has
nice
body
too
and
is
easy
to
drink
not
super
exciting
but
solid
in
every
facet
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easily
drinkable
beer
i
really
like
it
this
brew
is
perfect
for
spring
and
summer
the
smell
is
the
prominent
aspect
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
i
found
that
this
ale
is
very
upfront
with
the
hops
and
keep
them
kicking
throughout
the
entire
beer
and
well
after
each
draught
however
the
medium
body
and
crisp
finish
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
on
a
summer
day
quite
delicious
d
superb
expertly
crafted
balanced
brew
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
lots
of
flavour
not
too
heavy
or
bitter
without
this
beer
the
craft
beer
worldwide
might
not
be
where
it
is
today
to
many
of
us
beer
geeks
this
may
not
bring
the
excitement
of
an
imperial
ipa
but
it
is
a
damn
solid
beer
even
though
it
isnt
technically
sessionable
this
would
make
a
good
all
nighter
d
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
actually
one
of
the
first
micro
brews
i
have
ever
drank
about
a
year
ago
and
oh
what
a
journey
it
has
been
dstill
a
great
beer
after
9
months
or
so
on
the
shelf
im
sure
its
better
fresh
but
it
was
still
very
enjoyable
a
staple
beer
in
anybodys
beer
fridge
snpa
is
a
great
accomplishment
plus
it
was
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
ever
drank
years
before
i
would
drink
another
craft
beer
and
its
shaped
my
view
of
beer
i
have
no
idea
how
to
rate
it
because
its
essentially
my
yardstick
for
every
apa
ipa
and
dipa
that
ive
ever
tried
anyway
its
a
darkened
amber
color
with
a
wonderfully
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
piney
hops
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
starts
sweet
and
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
mostly
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
slickness
in
the
aftertaste
the
finish
has
a
healthy
dose
of
hop
bitterness
for
an
apa
this
beer
is
an
absolute
classic
d
6
of
these
will
not
make
it
through
the
night
in
my
fridge
drinkability
an
american
classic
that
i
could
session
a
nice
and
light
beer
that
is
perfect
for
outdoorsy
activities
its
availability
is
a
great
upside
its
my
go
to
beer
if
all
my
other
choices
are
bmcs
drinkability
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
good
flavor
not
overly
complex
but
well
crafted
d
again
great
smooth
beer
thats
readily
available
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
sit
around
and
drink
a
sixer
beer
this
is
my
go
to
when
looking
for
a
relatively
cheap
beer
that
i
can
drink
all
day
while
the
abv
is
not
technically
in
the
session
beer
category
its
one
beer
i
tend
to
session
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
is
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
the
best
widely
available
beer
on
the
market
d
not
something
ill
have
every
day
but
the
not
bad
for
a
pale
ale
wanted
to
try
this
since
it
got
such
a
high
average
review
on
here
but
not
a
beer
ill
keep
stocked
in
the
beer
fridge
it
had
been
awhile
since
ive
had
one
of
these
and
my
memory
was
better
than
the
bottle
i
just
tasted
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
trying
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
doubt
i
doubt
anything
has
changed
at
the
brewery
beer
looked
goldencopper
colored
with
a
white
head
and
nice
lacework
on
the
glass
it
had
a
resiny
pinelike
aroma
the
hop
bitterness
was
lacking
and
it
tasted
more
sweet
than
usual
not
as
dry
as
i
remember
this
beer
was
balanced
in
a
bad
way
it
normally
finishes
more
dry
maybe
the
bottleconditioning
never
took
off
on
this
batch
or
this
bottle
ill
try
again
soon
tons
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
always
enjoyable
o
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
they
dont
lie
on
the
label
when
it
says
purest
ingredients
and
finest
quality
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
picked
up
on
a
whim
and
really
enjoyed
i
would
definitely
pick
up
another
sixer
in
the
future
im
finishing
this
review
so
i
can
start
on
my
second
sierra
nevada
cheers
notes
from
growing
up
in
ca
sierra
nevada
has
always
been
near
the
top
of
my
list
as
far
as
breweries
its
impressive
to
see
how
much
theyve
grown
and
good
on
them
for
continuing
to
make
great
beer
on
such
a
large
scale
overall
an
outstanding
beer
that
you
would
not
want
to
miss
a
great
considerably
bitter
beer
that
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
youd
get
tired
of
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
i
noticed
to
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
after
i
read
that
it
was
bottle
conditioned
on
the
label
it
has
a
nice
golden
hue
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
the
malt
comes
through
as
i
drink
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
aroma
there
is
the
malt
backbone
with
some
hops
i
guess
im
just
so
used
to
ipas
and
dipas
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
i
put
it
right
up
there
behind
burning
river
as
far
as
apas
go
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
although
not
my
favorite
of
this
type
i
can
see
why
it
is
so
popular
nice
balance
of
hops
abv
aroma
mouthfeel
etc
overall
a
great
beer
and
definitely
something
i
would
not
turn
down
if
given
the
chance
d
the
balanced
body
sets
this
one
up
for
great
drinkability
a
classic
pale
d
an
excellent
pale
ale
this
is
pretty
close
to
being
a
session
beer
imo
i
could
easily
slug
back
a
sixer
in
a
night
a
great
all
round
example
of
this
style
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
full
head
and
good
carbonation
the
aroma
seems
to
hint
of
herbal
with
citrus
the
taste
is
crisp
and
bitter
up
front
with
a
trace
of
citrus
the
feel
is
creamy
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
and
finishes
dry
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
and
one
of
my
default
brews
when
i
want
something
comfortable
not
overpowering
d
very
frequently
this
is
the
best
option
in
the
house
restaurants
ballgames
nonbeer
festivals
concerts
etc
for
that
reason
alone
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
you
should
learn
to
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
one
finger
of
fluffy
head
that
lingers
a
long
time
great
hoppy
aroma
with
some
sweet
malt
notes
in
the
background
the
hop
aroma
is
crisp
and
piney
taste
starts
out
right
up
front
with
a
nice
medium
body
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
before
the
hops
just
blow
everything
else
away
while
bitter
it
is
in
no
way
harsh
or
unpleasant
helped
out
by
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
crispness
that
really
brings
the
flavor
out
and
intensifies
the
aroma
finish
is
lingering
with
a
earthy
bitterness
one
of
my
favorite
pales
pale
copper
in
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
head
which
is
retained
nicely
leaving
good
lacing
smells
of
hops
for
sure
plenty
of
citrus
and
pine
notes
which
a
touch
of
caramel
maltiness
in
the
background
tastes
about
the
same
great
hop
profile
with
mostly
pine
notes
caramel
and
bready
malts
come
through
nicely
making
for
a
balanced
easy
to
drink
ale
dthis
pale
ale
is
delicious
from
a
beautiful
pour
to
a
great
finish
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
i
didnt
try
this
for
a
long
time
and
now
regret
that
at
2
99
a
bomber
im
gonna
be
drinking
alot
more
of
this
d
i
could
drink
this
in
a
pinch
or
out
of
convince
purely
out
of
convince
this
is
a
large
supply
in
my
basement
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
citrus
notes
and
also
a
noticeable
caramel
presence
from
the
malt
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
but
balanced
out
with
some
malt
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
citrus
is
there
too
but
not
as
much
as
there
is
in
the
nose
lots
of
carbonation
too
very
clean
crisp
finish
and
very
drinkable
d
well
its
my
go
to
regular
bar
beer
its
so
available
easy
to
enjoy
its
got
tons
of
flavor
and
cheap
whats
not
to
like
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
and
despite
being
a
top
tier
brew
i
can
find
this
in
amongst
even
the
crappiest
of
bars
and
i
go
to
town
d
as
always
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
a
great
choice
for
most
any
occasion
a
great
pale
ale
and
deserves
great
recognition
pick
a
case
up
overall
arguably
this
beer
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
big
three
beers
that
facilitates
the
conversion
of
great
number
of
budmillercoors
drinkers
into
craft
drinkers
the
other
two
being
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
guinness
draught
i
wonder
how
many
hoppy
apas
and
ipas
exist
today
because
of
the
success
of
this
beer
regardless
it
is
a
reliable
widespread
wellcrafted
pale
ale
that
can
be
used
as
a
benchmark
to
rate
others
against
this
beer
promotes
beer
advocacy
and
on
that
note
it
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
know
this
craft
beer
has
gained
a
followig
while
i
would
not
rave
about
it
if
you
find
it
cheap
try
it
thumbs
up
d
a
great
go
to
west
coast
style
apa
done
as
right
as
you
can
get
crisp
refreshing
but
with
enough
kick
and
caramel
malt
to
balance
it
all
out
every
time
i
have
one
i
want
another
one
that
certainly
defines
drinkability
between
this
and
anchor
liberty
they
really
imo
set
the
standard
for
what
an
apa
should
be
this
is
my
favorite
session
beer
not
too
heavy
and
its
crisp
and
refreshing
properties
makes
this
a
dangerous
beer
to
have
around
in
cases
they
just
keep
going
down
and
down
old
standby
very
reasonably
priced
and
great
taste
will
always
have
a
spot
in
my
fridge
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
fall
in
love
with
its
medium
bodied
nature
lends
itself
to
great
sessions
as
does
its
low
abv
of
5
6
as
compared
to
other
hoppy
pale
ales
and
ipas
a
great
beer
overall
and
i
highly
recommend
picking
up
a
six
or
twelve
to
enjoy
during
the
coming
summer
months
great
drinkability
on
this
one
another
good
beer
to
session
d
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
apa
this
is
a
beer
i
use
as
a
gateway
beer
for
nonmicro
drinking
friends
to
get
them
into
craft
beers
clear
and
copper
pour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
hops
are
certainly
apparent
but
pretty
tame
scent
mostly
dominated
by
citrus
specifically
orange
peel
you
also
get
some
sweet
caramel
malt
aromas
its
pretty
refreshing
a
nice
session
beer
for
sure
the
citrus
hops
are
most
noticeable
just
as
in
the
scent
caramel
bready
malts
come
in
toward
the
back
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
my
favorite
beer
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
realize
this
and
the
reasons
for
this
statement
are
long
and
boring
i
say
this
is
my
favorite
beer
on
the
basis
of
aesthetic
economic
and
contextual
terms
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
one
really
works
for
me
i
went
with
this
for
the
first
of
my
5
gallon
shell
series
and
i
was
happy
i
did
sierra
nevada
has
a
wide
appeal
to
people
i
wont
order
this
at
every
bar
i
go
to
but
ill
drink
it
again
the
first
time
i
drank
this
beer
uc
davis
keg
party
in
93
i
was
a
senior
in
high
school
and
i
hated
it
i
asked
the
party
host
if
he
washed
his
cups
because
the
beer
tasted
like
it
had
soap
in
it
what
a
noob
very
eazy
and
likeable
drinkability
overall
very
good
drinks
a
bit
below
its
abv
its
simply
a
very
solid
beer
with
some
slight
additional
bitterness
and
citrus
overtones
this
beer
is
hard
not
to
like
unless
theres
a
component
of
it
that
youre
allergic
to
goes
great
with
all
sorts
of
summer
food
fare
but
has
enough
backbone
to
justify
just
drinking
it
because
you
like
it
quintessential
apa
and
a
great
brew
overall
its
a
really
well
crafted
beer
and
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
ever
had
perfectly
drinkable
for
all
year
round
but
i
like
to
drink
this
spring
and
summer
and
maybe
some
fall
but
not
as
much
during
the
fall
this
is
an
apa
i
really
like
to
be
better
it
could
possibly
have
a
little
more
maltiness
but
good
for
both
drinking
and
to
spicy
food
d
exceptional
indeed
a
great
beer
for
drinking
sharing
and
enjoying
especially
nice
in
warm
weather
or
after
a
long
day
highly
recommended
d
very
enjoyable
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
d
a
beer
to
savor
a
six
pack
would
do
me
just
fine
the
perfect
sessionable
apa
sns
flagship
is
just
that
for
a
reason
its
a
great
one
to
keep
in
the
fridge
when
you
need
a
comfort
beer
after
trying
out
doubletriple
ipas
etc
great
stuff
orange
colored
with
a
slight
head
when
poured
into
my
glass
i
like
the
smell
of
citrus
and
obvious
hop
action
the
taste
is
just
alright
to
me
though
i
like
pales
and
ipas
for
that
matter
but
this
one
just
didnt
hit
it
home
for
me
on
taste
i
feel
like
there
was
something
off
or
just
something
in
it
that
i
didnt
like
anyways
a
good
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
someday
down
the
road
good
looking
beer
hazy
copper
tone
with
orange
hues
big
fluffy
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
smells
good
floral
citric
and
a
little
soapy
has
a
strong
hop
bite
with
a
mild
grapefruit
flavor
nice
clean
dry
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
from
the
medium
body
and
soft
carbonation
very
drinkable
to
say
the
least
lovely
beer
and
is
usually
a
goto
beer
at
alot
of
chain
joints
very
solid
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
a
long
time
this
is
definitely
gonna
be
in
my
top
5
when
im
looking
for
a
six
pack
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
quickly
recedes
and
leaves
spotty
touches
of
lace
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
bready
and
is
dominated
by
floral
citrus
hops
theres
a
light
touch
of
caramel
malt
in
the
taste
but
this
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
citrus
hop
lasting
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
its
a
fairly
drinkable
and
refreshing
ale
heres
to
the
brew
that
is
the
gateway
for
many
of
us
craft
beer
geeks
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
hops
with
a
lot
of
orange
notes
the
flavor
is
orange
and
other
citrus
with
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
high
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
an
american
classic
that
never
disappoints
d
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
them
and
i
will
considering
it
was
on
sale
for
12
for
a
12
pack
deliciously
refreshing
pale
ale
perfect
beer
for
warming
weather
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
one
of
these
a
standardbearer
for
the
american
craft
beer
industry
and
always
a
reliable
goto
beer
for
pretty
much
any
situation
helps
bridge
the
gap
for
all
types
of
beer
drinkers
bottom
line
is
if
you
want
a
quality
pale
ale
this
is
your
man
the
craft
scene
is
flooded
with
pas
now
and
i
fear
this
one
is
often
taken
for
granted
but
i
still
use
this
beer
as
a
benchmark
when
judging
other
pale
ales
including
the
ones
that
i
brew
myself
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
enjoy
this
brew
very
much
its
always
a
good
standby
i
like
that
they
put
it
in
a
bomber
for
a
cheaper
price
more
incentive
to
buy
even
tho
im
really
paying
more
for
less
solid
brew
from
s
n
finger
plus
of
white
foam
medium
sized
bubbles
pop
here
and
there
slight
retention
settles
into
a
thin
layer
across
the
surface
not
much
stickiness
in
the
lacing
coppery
orange
to
yellow
in
hue
hazy
lighter
and
more
transparent
around
the
rims
the
herbal
hops
get
out
in
front
of
the
pack
in
the
nose
the
white
grapefruit
orange
pith
follows
behind
grainy
with
a
spicy
edge
more
lactose
than
florality
or
maltiness
sheer
activity
seems
to
be
its
strongest
aspect
mediumbodied
plus
here
its
relative
lack
of
movement
gives
it
more
gravitas
sweet
touch
to
the
orange
grapefruit
citrus
floral
dimension
a
bit
stunted
malts
undistinguished
smooth
things
texturally
but
dont
add
much
flavor
light
brown
sugar
peach
apricot
fruit
demure
the
bitter
residue
left
behind
through
the
finish
actually
gets
you
thirsting
for
more
never
as
good
as
when
you
remembered
it
as
a
kid
but
not
bad
either
d
a
superb
example
of
the
style
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
not
overly
bitter
malty
or
dry
but
just
right
always
a
great
summer
apa
in
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
if
you
enjoy
strong
hopsbitter
ales
i
tend
to
prefer
lagunitas
pale
ale
in
this
category
however
great
beer
another
hit
from
sierra
nevada
a
bright
brownishgold
color
with
a
small
purewhite
head
retention
is
lacking
with
only
the
finest
amount
of
lace
it
takes
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
to
get
some
head
aromas
are
faint
but
pleasant
nonetheless
ditto
that
on
the
flavor
you
get
what
youd
expect
basically
but
in
small
amounts
with
a
good
balance
between
fruit
bitterness
and
pine
with
some
herbal
hop
notes
and
just
enough
malt
to
hold
everything
together
the
body
is
mediumish
and
the
feel
is
slightly
undercarbonated
the
thing
that
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
that
its
balanced
exceptionally
well
but
it
isnt
going
to
knock
anyones
socks
off
i
really
wanted
more
out
of
it
particularly
from
the
hops
this
is
definitely
brewed
with
the
larger
market
in
mind
that
being
said
its
not
bad
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
at
all
and
i
think
its
a
good
training
wheel
pale
ale
but
fans
of
more
flavorful
styles
of
pales
will
be
well
suited
to
look
elsewhere
poured
into
a
pint
glass
orangy
golden
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
light
mango
smell
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
fairly
light
body
citrusy
with
a
light
piney
hop
awesome
example
of
an
ultradrinkable
pale
ale
good
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
probably
falls
within
your
definition
of
session
beer
if
not
dont
nag
and
is
easy
to
drink
d
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
very
drikable
great
session
beer
solid
very
drinkable
beer
especially
sitting
at
5
6
this
makes
it
almost
a
poor
mans
ipa
d
a
lovely
beer
that
went
down
very
well
had
i
had
a
second
bottle
i
would
probably
save
it
for
another
night
i
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
this
brew
it
is
a
true
pale
ale
and
tries
to
be
no
more
wellcrafted
and
just
what
i
hoped
it
would
taste
like
this
is
as
im
sure
it
was
for
many
others
a
beer
that
starter
my
path
to
quality
beer
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
west
coast
apa
and
is
probably
one
of
the
most
widely
distributed
micros
on
the
planet
this
is
the
beer
you
turn
to
when
you
are
at
a
bar
looking
for
what
they
have
on
tap
budlight
miller
light

really
id
rather
hook
up
with
the
larger
oneeyed

and
half
sized

at
the
other
end
of
the
bar
sn
pale
ale
thank
god
my
savior
when
you
say
micro
or
craft
beer
to
the
general
person
this
is
what
they
think
of
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
good
front
runner
for
craft
beer
it
has
a
good
hop
profile
a
decent
body
and
overall
its
a
respectable
beer
i
will
not
turn
it
down
at
a
party
and
i
will
not
frown
on
a
guy
who
brings
a
6er
to
a
party
good
beer
great
brew
co
mouthfeel
smooth
crisp
with
a
medium
body
notes
really
nice
hoppy
beer
with
lots
of
flavors
but
not
overly
hopped
great
widely
available
hoppy
beer
great
beer
to
have
for
everyday
drinking
had
my
fifth
sn
pale
ale
tonight
thought
id
have
another
for
reviewing
purposes
and
same
as
always
it
goes
down
very
smooth
very
clean
light
hops
aroma
with
a
piney
finish
taste
even
though
i
love
this
beer
i
do
think
its
an
extremely
drinkable
all
around
beer
just
a
bit
hyped
maybe
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
looked
like
a
traditional
pale
ale
with
not
a
very
large
head
it
had
a
hoppy
smell
that
was
pleasent
it
had
a
very
dry
and
hoppy
taste
exactly
what
you
would
want
out
of
a
pale
ale
it
didnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
and
was
easy
to
drink
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
deffently
worth
trying
and
enjoying
more
then
once
drinkability
i
want
an
other
one
value
considering
you
can
get
this
beer
at
most
fern
bars
and
lots
of
gas
stations
this
widely
available
brew
is
hard
to
deny
as
being
a
serious
bargain
at
under
ten
bucks
a
six
pack
sierra
nevada
apa
is
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
is
a
classic
beer
that
will
never
get
old
d
top
flight
here
i
can
drink
45
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
batting
an
eye
pours
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
pretty
white
head
mmm
cant
beat
northern
cali
hops
dank
nose
is
dominated
by
sweet
and
citrusy
pine
hops
tastes
is
mildly
tartsweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
bite
finish
that
is
very
welcomed
with
the
sweet
high
carbonation
medium
body
the
perfect
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
because
it
is
practically
an
ipa
taste
is
very
creamy
crisp
and
smooth
very
hopy
for
a
ale
ale
but
its
really
an
amazing
beer
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
developed
a
nice
white
head
that
went
down
to
a
creamy
lace
that
sticks
around
it
has
a
clear
honey
like
color
smell
is
slightly
citrusy
with
a
little
spice
initial
taste
is
citrus
with
good
hops
turns
into
a
nutty
biscuity
taste
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
of
malt
very
well
balanced
this
one
has
high
drinkability
its
february
now
but
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
notes
i
had
one
of
these
with
some
asiago
jack
and
cheddar
on
sweetish
bready
biscuits
the
combo
was
fantastic
d
at
5
6
there
is
very
little
alcohol
burn
as
it
goes
down
notes
for
some
reason
i
remember
that
this
same
exact
beer
tasted
a
lot
less
hoppy
and
bitter
when
i
had
it
this
past
weekend
one
big
difference
is
that
i
did
not
pour
it
into
a
glass
last
time
but
this
time
i
did
it
is
amazing
how
much
the
drinking
receptacle
can
change
the
experience
of
the
beer
i
much
preferred
this
beer
in
the
bottle
the
bitter
hops
were
more
balanced
by
the
malts
d
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
wanted
to
review
it
to
make
sure
it
was
as
good
as
i
remember
it
it
definitely
is
this
is
an
excellently
crafted
well
balanced
beer
that
still
deserves
high
recognition
rjt
notes
a
very
good
pale
ale
that
definitely
finds
its
place
under
an
ipa
it
doesnt
try
to
be
an
ipa
like
some
do
it
looks
amazing
and
tastes
good
just
a
solid
beer
dwell
done
pale
ale
this
was
the
beer
that
got
me
started
into
craft
brews
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
brings
a
nice
balance
of
pale
malts
and
citrusy
hops
notes
theres
not
much
i
can
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
been
said
already
this
is
a
classic
pale
ale
and
if
you
like
hops
or
are
trying
to
get
into
the
hoppier
stuff
this
one
should
be
on
your
list
classic
in
every
way
i
had
this
on
tap
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
fresh
from
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
as
is
drinkability
d
refreshing
and
very
very
drinkable
all
this
is
relative
however
snpa
is
so
far
ahead
of
the
light
yellow
upbiquitous
mainstream
american
beers
and
in
fact
way
ahead
of
the
top
european
imported
lagers
and
its
american
and
available
so
go
for
it
ill
continue
to
find
this
beer
underrated
but
look
forward
to
trying
some
other
sn
to
see
what
all
the
hubbub
is
about
d
very
good
i
could
drink
a
case
of
this
common
as
water
stateside
but
very
difficult
to
come
by
on
this
side
of
the
border
tastes
pretty
much
like
my
favorite
local
hoppedup
pale
ale
full
moon
so
i
cant
help
but
like
it
a
lot
i
think
they
did
it
perfectly
any
more
or
less
could
have
taken
this
down
a
notch
or
two
probably
one
of
the
most
underrated
beers
simply
because
it
is
so
readily
available
but
definitely
a
topnotch
apa
d
a
great
session
beer
easily
drinkable
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
for
quite
a
long
time
and
is
still
high
on
the
list
as
its
readily
available
drinkability
this
is
the
most
sessionable
and
consistant
pale
ale
out
there
its
one
on
its
own
and
every
other
pale
ale
should
strive
to
compete
with
this
one
because
its
setting
the
bar
very
high
body
lightmedium
on
the
palate
lighter
on
the
finish
notes
while
im
not
too
big
a
fan
of
the
style
or
of
this
particular
brew
it
is
a
very
welcome
and
reliable
presence
in
otherwise
mediocre
menus
out
there
years
ago
i
used
to
go
quite
a
bit
to
it
in
run
of
the
mill
corner
stores
that
would
offer
something
to
stay
away
from
the
macros
and
in
a
way
this
is
one
of
a
handful
of
beers
that
really
got
me
initiated
in
the
us
craft
offerings
although
lately
it
is
barely
ever
in
my
fridge
it
remains
solid
and
pleasing
quite
a
nice
beer
a
good
solid
all
night
drinker
d
very
sessionable
bitterness
stands
out
as
almost
being
offensive
the
apa
style
is
not
something
im
accustomed
to
which
may
have
put
me
off
a
bit
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
classic
d
i
typically
reserve
pale
ales
for
midflight
but
this
one
might
be
the
exception
goes
great
with
normal
foods
and
isnt
as
heavy
as
it
seems
for
a
pale
ale
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
fair
amount
without
the
palet
going
crazy
around
40
ibus
so
its
just
in
that
range
where
its
not
too
much
to
notice
on
a
busy
night
4
55
as
im
sure
it
would
be
refreshing
in
the
heat
snpa
is
a
great
beer
maybe
even
exceptional
bet
these
reviews
were
a
lot
better
before
it
became
so
popular
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
tried
this
out
at
band
practice
last
week
and
it
seemed
to
go
down
pretty
well
it
is
probably
even
better
with
a
burger
outdoors
in
the
summer
drinkability
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ever
keep
coming
back
for
more
im
not
a
hophead
and
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
its
bitter
without
being
bitter
this
is
one
ill
be
coming
back
to
all
i
can
say
is
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
due
to
the
dry
clean
finish
as
everyone
on
here
seems
to
say
this
beer
is
on
tap
at
many
bars
and
is
a
great
choice
when
you
dont
have
the
wide
craft
beer
selection
a
very
sessionable
brew
this
beers
light
body
and
creamy
finish
have
me
looking
for
more
this
is
only
my
second
brew
from
sn
and
i
was
a
bit
gunshy
so
shy
in
fact
that
not
until
a
neighbor
gave
me
this
one
did
i
venture
forth
the
first
was
bigfoot
which
was
not
a
welcome
brew
as
it
was
more
like
biting
into
a
grapefruit
rind
then
getting
punched
in
the
back
of
the
head
this
beer
is
much
more
reasonable
and
im
now
willing
to
try
more
from
sn
there
is
almost
always
at
least
a
few
bottles
of
snpa
in
my
fridge
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
can
drink
these
all
night
long
i
love
them
tasted
at
caesars
palace
in
vegas
couldnt
see
the
appearance
because
i
drink
from
the
bottle
but
the
logo
had
some
hops
and
a
landscape
smell
perfumed
with
hops
and
some
apple
honey
and
toffee
tasted
floral
and
pine
hops
together
with
pineapple
and
peach
scents
mouthfeel
dry
bittersweet
with
a
bitter
finish
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
very
good
i
drank
while
playing
slots
this
is
a
versatile
enjoyable
brew
thats
not
a
challenge
to
drink
nor
too
heavy
on
the
stomach
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
from
a
perfect
5
is
the
sticky
bitter
finish
that
lingers
just
a
bit
long
i
feel
like
i
need
to
wash
my
mouth
out
with
something
less
sticky
and
lingering
sure
well
phrase
it
that
way
otherwise
very
good
d
very
enjoyable
my
friend
says
its
bitter
but
i
dont
think
so
at
all
a
great
starting
point
for
american
craft
beesr
a
great
anytime
beer
worthy
of
its
place
in
the
american
craft
beer
pantheon
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
many
ways
not
only
would
i
like
another
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
past
and
im
sure
ill
be
having
it
again
it
goes
nicely
as
a
counterpoint
to
lightly
spiced
foods
and
is
a
nice
allaround
beer
while
there
are
other
apas
out
there
id
not
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
a
nice
drinkable
pale
ale
to
have
on
any
occasion
a
quintessential
apa
while
it
is
maltier
than
expected
it
ticks
all
the
boxes
even
if
it
isnt
spectacular
it
could
have
more
hop
aroma
and
flavour
to
help
carry
the
beer
to
greater
heights
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
pale
ale
very
drinkable
beer
great
choice
since
it
is
a
pretty
popular
this
is
usually
my
go
to
beer
at
a
place
with
not
the
best
selection
i
used
to
overlook
this
beer
but
i
give
it
my
respect
d
one
of
my
favorite
pas
now
that
ive
been
able
to
try
it
not
too
hard
hitting
and
but
wonderfully
flavorful
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
beer
this
should
be
the
standard
when
it
comes
to
bottles
at
parties
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
and
nice
streams
of
carbonation
it
has
a
citrusy
and
hoppy
nose
the
flavor
is
pretty
similar
and
stays
consistent
with
a
light
bitter
citrus
pine
hop
notewith
some
malty
almost
bready
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
an
average
medium
body
in
a
very
pleasant
way
it
is
a
nice
standard
pale
ale
that
makes
itself
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
with
its
classic
simplicity
a
very
drinkable
classic
tasting
american
pale
ale
a
wonderful
staple
session
beer
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
years
ago
and
its
still
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
session
beer
it
has
a
nice
punch
of
cascade
hops
that
give
it
a
nice
floral
bouquet
and
clean
almost
grassy
taste
without
being
overbearing
the
moderate
alcohol
content
and
light
malt
flavor
makes
this
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
wear
on
the
palate
like
heavier
or
hoppier
beers
also
this
beer
pairs
well
with
almost
any
food
but
beef
or
spicy
barbecue
seem
the
most
appropriate
snpa
smells
of
citric
hops
taste
is
pretty
hopforward
with
citrus
and
pine
not
much
detected
from
the
malts
bitter
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
for
the
style
and
abv
pretty
highly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
not
too
bitter
or
having
any
other
characteristics
that
would
prevent
more
consumption
pours
a
clear
light
copperblonde
color
with
a
light
and
lacy
white
head
through
the
glass
you
can
see
the
high
carbonation
levels
as
bubbles
float
to
the
surface
and
send
out
a
noseful
of
citrus
hops
aroma
the
drink
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
generous
helping
of
citrus
hops
overpower
the
slight
hints
of
complementing
malt
the
body
is
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
it
finishes
with
a
smooth
reminder
of
the
citrus
bitterness
and
fades
out
slowly
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
knocks
this
down
for
me
a
bit
i
think
but
the
taste
is
light
and
nice
i
remember
not
liking
this
beer
before
i
got
into
craft
beers
and
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
try
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
for
me
sn
pale
ale
and
brooklyn
lager
are
the
two
beers
that
you
can
always
find
in
my
fridge
d
drinkable
because
of
the
light
bodied
and
enjoyable
because
of
the
simplicity
however
nothing
to
really
think
about
here
and
therefore
not
as
enjoyable
as
it
could
be
for
me
overall
there
may
be
better
american
pale
ales
out
there
but
i
havent
had
one
thanks
to
sierra
nevada
along
with
samuel
adams
i
never
have
the
fear
of
not
being
able
to
find
good
beer
you
can
pick
this
stuff
up
at
just
about
any
place
that
sells
alcohol
its
a
good
feeling
darkish
orange
with
some
yeast
from
bottleconditioning
nicely
balancedjust
enough
hops
to
notice
them
but
leaves
plenty
of
room
for
a
nice
fruitycitrusy
background
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
and
should
appeal
to
most
beer
drinkers
im
impressed
with
this
beer
great
flavor
but
not
too
much
for
the
palate
to
handle
i
could
definetly
enjoy
six
of
these
and
never
lose
interest
bravo
on
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
chilled
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
ample
offwhite
head
malt
citrus
notes
super
refreshing
beer
robust
grassy
hop
taste
with
hints
of
citrus
a
solid
malt
backbone
evens
things
out
and
gives
this
a
medium
body
a
classic
d
it
bears
repeating
very
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
standard
in
so
many
bars
in
the
us
and
theres
a
reason
why
almost
anyone
could
drink
this
and
enjoy
it
and
enjoy
five
of
them
in
one
sitting
this
is
definately
one
of
those
beers
that
we
see
most
of
the
time
in
australia
but
for
some
reason
i
havnt
seen
it
on
our
shelves
for
the
last
few
months
or
even
longer
so
was
stoked
to
see
it
againit
pours
a
very
nice
bright
orange
with
some
amber
highlights
and
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
that
leaves
a
frothy
two
finger
head
with
lacing
everywhere
a
very
impressive
looking
beerand
it
doesnt
stop
there
the
aroma
is
piney
sweet
malty
coated
hops
and
very
inviting
indeedit
has
a
nice
creamy
full
mouthfeel
with
a
taste
of
the
perfect
same
balance
that
is
one
on
the
nose
with
caramel
malts
firstly
followed
by
the
finish
which
is
nice
and
light
with
a
subtle
touch
of
fruitypiney
hops
and
no
hint
of
its
abv
on
my
palettethis
is
definately
a
beer
that
i
always
enjoy
everytime
i
drink
it
and
to
be
honest
is
probably
better
than
the
last
time
i
tasted
and
will
be
buying
again
without
a
doubt
d
finish
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
could
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
tastes
but
probably
my
favorite
go
to
beer
the
quintessential
pale
ale
in
the
united
states
and
as
with
so
many
other
american
beer
drinkers
my
introduction
to
good
beer
back
in
the
early
1990s
many
have
been
brewed
since
with
varying
strengths
and
weaknesses
but
the
original
snpa
has
not
lost
its
shine
i
particularly
like
this
beer
not
just
because
it
is
my
favorite
style
but
because
of
its
exceptional
drinkability
the
bitterness
of
the
overall
hop
character
is
not
too
overpowering
for
the
light
citrusy
taste
yet
it
still
lets
you
know
that
it
is
a
pale
ale
and
as
far
as
citrusy
character
goes
i
feel
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
utilizers
of
the
cascade
hop
the
aroma
is
one
of
the
traits
i
love
best
about
this
brew
but
enough
writing
i
need
to
drink
more
of
this
beer
and
i
cant
do
that
while
typing
d
highly
drinkable
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
for
a
fairly
hoppy
beer
alcohol
is
wellhidden
d
always
a
great
drinkthe
apa
that
sets
the
bar
for
all
others
sessions
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
session
beer
this
beer
is
alright
it
tastes
like
a
textbook
definition
of
an
american
pale
ale
personallly
i
think
it
is
so
boring
i
could
die
well
brewed
i
guess
this
just
isnt
my
style
i
love
the
hop
and
malt
forward
brews
by
sierra
nevada
but
their
flagship
puts
me
to
sleep
nothing
against
balanced
beers
im
just
not
crazy
about
this
one
its
just
so
boring
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
pours
a
clean
cut
golden
amber
dark
rosy
color
that
is
very
inviting
and
crispy
head
is
off
white
and
sticks
and
laces
and
emits
aromas
of
sticky
hops
roasty
and
clean
malts
pine
trees
nectarines
and
ripe
plums
taste
is
balanced
and
fair
honest
and
fairly
bitter
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
alright
as
well
drinkability
easily
a
session
beer
a
6
pack
on
any
evening
would
be
an
absolute
treat
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
apa
along
with
being
a
classic
d
a
pleasantly
drinkable
pale
ale
one
that
doesnt
skimp
on
the
hops
snpa
is
an
ale
best
served
fresh
ontap
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
reliable
accesible
beers
out
there
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
d
goes
down
very
easy
not
being
a
hop
head
this
is
a
brew
i
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
without
feeling
like
my
palette
has
been
violated
always
my
first
choice
when
in
bmc
country
as
it
is
available
almost
everywhere
but
its
a
lot
more
than
just
a
fall
back
beer
d
very
easydrinking
this
beer
is
not
the
most
complex
apa
but
its
very
drinkerfriendly
i
downed
the
24oz
bottle
in
no
time
provided
im
nowhere
near
being
a
guzzlelover
so
it
definitely
deserves
a
round
of
applause
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
quenches
the
thirst
as
a
good
pale
ale
ought
to
king
of
the
style
and
it
keeps
its
chops
d
a
goto
beer
and
very
available
you
shouldnt
have
to
travel
too
far
to
find
a
snpa
six
pack
if
you
do
someones
not
doing
their
job
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
half
a
case
of
in
a
night
but
its
definitely
a
solid
beer
i
would
buy
time
and
time
again

thankful
to

notes
a
full
flavored
session
beer
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
definitely
one
of
the
best
apas
out
there
in
terms
of
availability
pretty
common
so
youll
find
this
relatively
easily
pours
a
nice
golden
color
aroma
is
of
hops
and
wheat
with
some
light
citrus
taste
matches
aroma
also
has
a
slightly
stronger
carbonation
mouthfeel
great
beer
to
start
someone
off
with
not
many
apas
really
stand
up
to
this
american
classic
and
yes
i
do
believe
it
has
earned
the
title
american
classic
as
it
is
actually
starting
to
stand
out
against
the
macros
price
availability
taste
and
drinkability
are
the
reasons
why
this
is
apa
around
great
gateway
beer
not
really
an
apa
guy
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
nice
change
from
the
rips
and
porters
i
usually
drink
nice
beer
overall
nothing
really
special
though
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
the
best
widelyavailable
beer
ive
had
its
a
pleasure
to
find
it
on
the
menu
at
a
restaurant
with
a
poor
selection
it
also
would
serve
very
well
as
an
everyday
beer
d
very
very
drinkable
too
drinkable
d
easy
to
drink
the
hoppiness
might
offend
the
palates
of
some
people
but
those
who
appreciate
the
taste
will
love
this
beer
a
bit
disappointing
at
first
in
smell
and
appearance
but
taste
feel
and
drinkability
make
this
an
all
around
decent
beer
it
had
a
light
crisp
medium
bitterness
with
a
light
feel
on
the
tongue
nice
drinkable
beer
this
one
could
carry
you
through
the
evening
easily
this
was
a
whole
different
experience
on
tap
my
review
of
the
bottle
came
out
to
a
b
however
it
may
have
been
an
old
bottle
because
on
tap
this
was
much
more
like
the
classic
apa
it
claims
to
be
very
hoppy
piney
and
citrusy
in
the
nose
nice
sheets
of
lace
left
on
the
pint
glass
but
disappear
after
a
few
minutes
great
color
to
the
beer
and
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
hoppy
with
crisp
fruit
and
pine
showing
their
muscles
very
drinkable
and
very
nicely
done
i
must
say
it
was
a
totally
different
experience
on
tap
overall
its
too
bitter
and
sour
and
not
enough
malt
to
balance
hop
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
bit
lacking
the
flavors
it
does
have
taste
stale
as
it
warms
it
releases
more
of
a
maltysweet
aroma
but
there
still
isnt
much
more
than
bitterness
on
the
palate
if
someone
offered
me
another
id
take
it
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
there
is
a
lot
of
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
from
the
hops
there
isnt
much
to
speak
of
in
the
front
or
perhaps
i
am
just
distracted
by
the
hop
bitterness
drinkability
high
one
of
my
favorite
stand
by
beers
that
is
readily
available
nearly
everywhere
poured
into
a
beer
glass
which
produced
a
nice
foamy
nice
head
and
a
nice
nutty
brown
colour
it
had
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
about
it
which
did
not
disappoint
as
i
drank
it
a
balanced
hoppyness
lingers
nicely
on
the
palate
a
beer
i
could
drink
over
and
over
and
makes
me
wish
i
could
get
a
beer
this
good
this
cheap
in
canada
sigh
overall
this
beers
reputation
as
the
old
faithful
of
apas
is
warranted
hopforward
beers
such
as
apas
and
ipas
arent
exactly
my
thing
but
if
im
craving
an
apa
this
comes
to
mind
i
remember
having
this
beer
once
before
i
was
really
into
craft
beer
at
that
time
it
was
quite
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
to
enjoy
it
now
i
clearly
see
why
its
a
benchmark
for
apas
excellent
beer
but
not
my
style
d
a
good
beer
and
still
a
special
one
to
me
at
the
time
it
was
the
most
unique
beer
in
the
conference
center
that
i
stayed
as
for
drinkability
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
anytime
i
go
a
few
weeks
without
having
one
the
next
time
i
am
reminded
what
a
quality
beer
this
is
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
the
american
standard
that
all
other
apas
will
be
judged
by
in
my
book
very
tasty
overall
a
decent
brew
not
more
not
less
will
not
refuse
one
in
the
future
pours
a
golden
into
a
standard
pint
glass
some
head
which
dissipates
with
time
nothing
remarkable
or
unique
about
this
smell
perhaps
a
bit
floral
taste
is
somewhat
piney
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
perhaps
citrus
some
hops
not
overwhelming
though
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
some
moderate
carbonation
very
smooth
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
while
perhaps
not
a
session
beer
this
one
begs
for
you
to
drink
more
and
pairs
very
nicely
with
food
i
recently
had
a
bottle
with
a
bleu
cheese
encrusted
steak
sandwich
which
was
absolutely
divine
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
and
making
it
vanish
within
a
single
night
edit
1214
after
multiple
experiences
with
this
im
upping
the
drinkability
on
this
to
a
5
from
4
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
few
brews
im
willing
to
buy
6
packs
of
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
to
gulp
down
when
you
are
hot
sweaty
perfect
with
a
variety
of
foods
as
it
compliments
but
does
not
over
power
your
food
crisp
flavorful
then
a
wonderful
faint
bitterness
on
the
finish
cheers
poured
into
a
twelve
ounce
mug
it
has
a
deep
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
big
three
finger
head
the
head
is
still
there
after
the
beer
is
long
gone
great
smell
i
love
that
herbal
pine
and
grapefruit
west
cost
smell
this
beer
is
a
true
masterpiece
im
not
going
to
waste
time
describing
the
taste
other
than
to
say
its
as
close
to
perfect
beer
flavor
as
humanly
possible
all
the
flavors
are
absolutlely
right
on
balanced
in
exactly
the
right
way
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
enough
to
be
satisfying
but
not
too
heavy
to
fill
you
up
it
is
scary
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
i
could
go
on
and
on
to
sum
it
up
its
a
once
in
a
lifetime
creation
that
actually
surpasses
the
hype
i
love
it
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ever
period
yes
the
5
6
abv
technically
disqualifies
it
from
the
session
beer
category
but
i
find
myself
making
a
session
out
of
snpa
way
too
often
the
flavors
are
just
solid
without
being
overpowering
making
this
a
great
beer
to
have
a
few
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
pretty
much
has
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
and
likely
always
will
was
a
very
nice
golden
amber
with
an
almost
2
inch
foamy
head
head
stayed
for
most
of
the
glass
and
stuck
to
it
nicely
was
a
very
wellbalanced
brew
very
hoppy
aroma
as
well
as
taste
but
not
too
overwhelming
where
i
couldnt
drink
this
regularly
probably
the
best
apa
ive
had
to
date
drinkability
not
like
what
i
remember
no
cigarette
butts
this
time
a
very
good
brew
for
a
meal
in
the
sierra
nevadas
its
true
to
a
style
which
is
not
my
favorite
one
of
the
few
beers
i
actually
buy
often
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
american
pale
ales
a
classic
drinking
the
beer
out
of
an
american
pint
glass
the
slightly
cloudy
offgolden
bottle
conditioned
beer
forms
a
nice
off
white
head
the
head
eventually
gives
way
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
while
the
small
carbonation
bubbles
jet
to
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
gives
you
a
tease
of
hops
but
mostly
the
malty
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
nose
the
first
sip
gives
way
to
that
sweet
initial
taste
then
its
quickly
balanced
by
the
floral
hops
finishing
with
a
faint
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
target
which
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
perfect
for
complimenting
bar
food
pizza
wings
poppers
burgers
its
also
a
great
everyday
beer
which
should
occupy
any
american
pale
ale
lovers
beer
fridge
or
beer
meister
a
great
beer
for
anyone
who
loves
a
nice
flavorful
but
not
over
the
top
american
pale
ale
overall
a
great
pale
ale
a
classic
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
yes
could
stay
with
this
all
night
md
very
drinkable
with
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
that
you
can
get
pretty
much
anywhere
this
was
pleasant
overall
this
is
definitely
classic
brew
that
i
havent
had
in
at
least
a
year
but
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
theres
definitely
a
reason
that
so
many
people
drink
this
when
they
are
starting
to
get
into
craft
brews
great
beer
for
just
that
reason
gave
it
a
5
on
drinkability
could
and
have
made
this
beer
a
all
night
session
beer
love
it
md
very
easy
to
drink
totally
approachable
for
a
newcomer
to
craft
beers
but
still
enjoyable
for
seasoned
tasters
as
close
as
an
apa
can
come
to
ipa
in
hop
smell
flavor
and
bitterness
overall
the
draft
version
exceededs
the
bottle
by
a
mile
an
extremely
drinkable
apa
that
i
will
continue
coming
back
to
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
smell
is
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
similar
the
citrus
and
cascade
hops
are
really
noticeable
but
its
not
really
bitter
theres
a
slight
hint
of
spice
here
quite
drinkable
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
a
great
drinking
beer
with
some
extraordinary
drinkability
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
drink
mowing
the
lawn
or
out
on
the
town
nothing
complex
or
mysterious
just
a
good
honest
pale
ale
cheers
can
and
will
drink
anytime
always
in
my
fridge
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
amberorange
color
with
a
very
good
carbonation
presence
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
pine
and
citrus
from
the
getgo
but
you
can
also
detect
some
biscuit
and
malt
in
there
as
well
the
taste
reveals
why
so
few
people
have
been
able
to
duplicate
this
pale
ales
success
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavor
gives
way
to
maltiness
which
then
gives
way
to
a
dry
finish
nice
mediumbodied
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
great
dry
finish
this
beer
defines
session
pale
ale
dvery
very
drinkable
a
great
session
brew
to
be
sure
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
golden
orange
color
the
smell
consists
of
fruit
with
a
bit
of
a
pine
twist
the
taste
is
great
it
starts
off
very
fruity
with
a
hint
of
malts
but
mostly
hops
hops
hops
i
love
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
lightly
carbonated
and
a
bit
buttery
since
it
has
a
light
alcohol
rating
a
could
drink
a
good
amout
of
these
before
i
get
too
buzzed
between
this
ale
and
boulavard
pale
ale
theyre
the
beers
i
can
always
count
on
for
a
great
hop
tastesmell
when
there
is
nothing
else
good
in
stock
these
two
are
my
fallback
beere
between
the
great
taste
and
smooth
hoppy
finish
this
one
is
a
winner
which
is
why
its
one
of
the
industry
standards
when
it
comes
to
american
pale
ales
by
the
time
i
got
the
glass
the
head
was
very
thin
which
was
a
disappointment
the
body
was
brownish
orange
with
a
lot
of
playful
bubbliness
nice
nose
a
lot
of
grape
and
citrus
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
and
yeast
ah
the
taste
was
multi
dimensional
with
a
sharp
zesty
bite
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
robust
hop
bitterness
more
than
average
for
a
pale
ale
a
lot
of
carbonation
there
with
a
light
palate
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
yet
flavorful
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
may
just
make
my
top
15
or
so
only
time
will
tell
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
beer
this
is
the
beer
me
and
my
buddies
go
to
beer
if
nothing
else
is
available
very
nice
beer
to
have
while
working
on
the
cars
or
relaxing
on
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
football
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
i
think
after
that
my
taste
buds
would
be
a
little
worn
out
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
massproduced
beers
out
there
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
decent
taste
the
classic
american
pale
ale
as
great
as
its
always
been
the
mouthfeel
is
too
dry
and
very
flat
so
hmmm
the
fruity
esters
are
not
too
penetrant
but
there
are
no
earwax
hops
in
it
this
is
truly
a
classic
american
ale
by
a
classic
american
brewery
and
as
i
said
straightaway
in
my
opinion
the
classic
american
pale
ale
d
wonderful
sessionable
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
when
people
talk
about
apa
balance
this
is
what
their
talking
about
this
is
my
go
to
case
of
pale
ale
so
tasty
drinkability
i
was
pretty
let
down
by
this
one
i
was
hoping
that
this
cask
conditioned
snpa
would
showcase
the
beers
malt
profile
and
while
it
did
bring
the
malt
side
into
the
spotlight
i
feel
like
this
beers
shortcomings
were
just
exposed
i
didnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
but
given
my
time
constraints
that
night
this
felt
like
a
waste
oh
well
now
i
know
nice
beer
to
drink
on
labor
day
while
im
relaxing
its
all
preaty
close
to
the
same
as
the
torpedo
but
not
as
strong
of
a
taste
but
not
weak
very
well
balanced
i
can
see
myself
easly
drinking
alot
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
would
buy
this
agian
for
sure
this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
very
available
too
my
local
safeway
carries
it
pours
a
golden
amber
and
you
can
immediately
smell
the
citrusgrapefruit
scent
tastes
like
grapefruit
too
a
little
sweetness
but
not
too
much
a
litle
carbonation
but
not
too
much
a
little
malt
but
not
too
much
overall
it
would
be
really
hard
to
improve
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
and
very
drinkable
when
i
want
a
lighter
flavored
beer
this
is
the
one
i
go
for
d
extremely
drinkable
with
perfect
balance
and
surprising
depth
one
of
the
most
flavorful
american
pale
ales
ive
had
in
the
mouth
it
feels
clean
and
filling
and
crisp
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
have
work
to
do
overall
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
has
a
tinge
more
hops
which
is
aok
in
my
book
and
the
citrus
really
brings
it
all
together
pale
ales
are
not
my
thing
but
this
thing
definitely
does
what
its
supposed
to
do
its
a
nice
switch
up
from
the
malt
bombs
which
dominate
my
life
a
good
gateway
craftbeer
d
this
beer
is
my
go
to
pale
and
well
my
go
to
beer
if
nothing
else
is
around
i
always
come
back
to
this
beer
even
after
i
drink
myself
to
death
on
hopbombs
or
extreme
maltbombs
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
always
does
the
trick
would
recommend
to
everyone
great
gateway
beer
into
the
craft
world
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
snpa
i
dont
drink
it
much
since
we
have
a
good
local
apa
in
summit
but
the
6er
was
on
sale
so
i
picked
up
some
nicely
balanced
nothing
too
exciting
these
days
but
would
have
been
amazing
20
years
ago
d
very
drinkable
the
right
mix
of
hops
and
malt
allowing
many
of
these
to
be
put
away
in
a
single
sitting
this
goes
down
so
easy
i
regret
not
drinking
lots
more
of
this
ill
have
to
work
on
that
drinkability
well
at
5
6
its
drinkable
but
also
kind
of
dull
and
not
too
great
and
the
alcohol
is
actually
more
present
than
ive
had
in
a
few
beers
almost
double
its
abv
ive
had
it
better
in
the
past
but
the
flavors
are
just
a
little
too
mild
for
my
mood
and
wanted
just
a
tad
more
from
it
the
nose
is
a
balance
of
subtle
grapefruit
and
apple
slice
with
gentle
biscuit
malt
and
a
slight
hoppy
resin
flavor
is
wellbalanced
with
bitterness
offset
by
gentle
malt
which
is
boosted
by
the
smooth
mouthfeel
as
this
pale
ale
warms
the
bitterness
subsides
leaving
the
smooth
relatively
thick
mouthfeel
for
a
pale
ale
in
memory
very
balanced
drinkable
pale
ale
which
has
become
a
staple
to
keep
in
stock
for
myself
and
to
share
with
visitors
who
may
or
may
not
be
craft
brew
drinkers
this
beer
goes
great
with
everything
from
mowing
the
lawn
to
drinking
at
the
beach
to
camping
to
partying
with
best
session
beer
taste
a
slight
malt
sweetness
that
is
complimented
nicely
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
isnt
overpowering
in
anyway
it
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
those
who
have
not
tried
anything
from
the
dark
side
i
also
had
this
beer
over
seafood
provencal
and
it
went
well
together
classic
snpa
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
its
a
solid
staple
beer
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
and
a
perfect
and
likely
crossover
beer
5i
enjoy
it
and
im
god
overall
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
or
party
beer
its
got
a
nice
kicky
abv
but
not
too
much
to
ruin
a
good
session
not
on
par
with
say
alpha
king
though
d
very
high
at
5
6
abv
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
enjoy
them
d
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
be
a
solid
summer
beer
edit
ive
had
this
at
various
bars
on
tap
and
it
doesnt
come
close
to
the
experiences
ive
had
with
the
bottled
version
so
take
what
you
want
from
that
the
beer
pours
a
nice
but
small
head
it
is
a
nice
clear
yellow
color
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
it
smells
slightly
of
citrus
like
hops
and
like
quality
malt
the
taste
is
pleasantly
hoppy
there
is
a
bit
of
good
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
which
taste
citrusy
over
all
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
on
the
market
t
m
d
high
hop
flavor
with
low
malt
character
to
allow
the
hop
flavor
to
come
through
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
smooth
finish
with
complex
hop
citrus
and
flowery
notes
very
drinkable
and
perfect
for
any
occasion
one
of
the
only
2
beers
that
i
allowed
at
my
wedding
drinkability
fantastic
something
i
could
definitely
drink
on
a
regular
basis
d
good
beer
unfair
to
compare
with
an
ipa
if
you
are
expecting
more
hops
actually
got
better
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
finally
got
a
hold
of
one
of
these
a
little
hard
to
come
by
round
these
parts
happy
to
say
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
soft
grapefruity
citrus
nose
with
lovely
itching
bitterness
that
fills
the
mouth
a
sturdy
caramel
malt
backbone
as
well
in
perfect
balance
with
the
hop
flavours
carbonation
malt
hops
bitterness
all
in
line
wish
it
was
more
availableand
cheaper
overall
a
classic
beer
very
tasty
and
drinkable
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
a
pretty
clear
and
pretty
lively
golden
ale
with
a
thin
white
film
that
leaves
good
lacing
it
has
a
simple
and
assertive
hoppy
aroma
like
grapefruit
peel
its
mediumlight
bodied
smooth
and
lively
with
a
crisp
finish
it
has
a
classic
flavor
with
a
prominent
cascade
taste
its
perfectly
balanced
with
the
malt
which
has
a
hint
of
caramel
this
is
the
definitive
american
pale
ale
against
which
all
others
are
compared
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
taste
is
hops
some
bitterness
a
bit
of
malts
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
tried
this
before
and
was
unimpressed
but
now
i
found
it
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
light
carbonation
that
gives
room
in
a
complimentary
way
the
feel
is
off
its
just
that
this
pale
ale
is
not
about
texture
a
classic
beer
one
of
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
on
the
beer
market
if
you
havent
had
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
yet
go
get
one
if
this
was
unfiltered
it
would
bring
this
up
to
a
new
level
in
my
book
poured
from
a
tap
into
a
pint
glass
its
a
nice
evenly
colored
beer
with
a
good
head
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
slight
pine
the
taste
is
flowery
with
a
finish
of
minor
hops
a
beer
that
goes
down
well
and
also
is
a
nice
spacer
in
between
some
big
ipas
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
made
for
drinking
more
than
one
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
i
seem
to
always
go
back
to
it
when
i
am
out
due
to
its
wide
availability
and
overall
good
quality
pours
a
golden
amber
color
the
aroma
is
of
a
malt
backbone
smells
of
bread
and
a
citrus
and
floral
hop
over
the
top
the
taste
is
of
a
good
floral
and
citrus
hop
top
coat
however
not
overly
bitter
with
a
malt
bread
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
pale
ale
the
hop
taste
isnt
as
bitter
as
other
pale
ales
making
it
more
drinkable
than
most
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
have
a
great
sessionable
pale
ale
that
is
always
a
solid
choice
my
favorite
standby
pale
ale
a
great
west
coast
hoppy
pale
ale
love
them
cascade
hops
one
of
my
gateway
craft
beers
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
this
pale
ale
is
the
ultimate
for
its
style
and
can
be
best
appreciated
after
laying
off
hoppier
beers
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
perfect
and
the
look
taste
and
drinkability
is
great
any
time
of
year
or
in
any
situation
good
copper
color
amazing
aroma
of
hops
try
after
drinking
a
lot
of
lighter
beers
very
drinkable
beer
that
turns
into
a
six
pack
really
quick
it
has
a
medium
body
and
doesnt
offend
the
palete
da
good
apa
somewhat
overrated
in
my
opinion
very
easy
drinking
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
but
i
like
to
drink
apas
cold
and
in
large
gulps
to
quench
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
overall
a
nice
hoppy
brew
with
a
workhorse
feel
definitely
destined
to
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
a
solid
pale
ale
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
humid
day
like
today
d
this
is
a
great
beer
and
if
you
havnt
had
it
get
get
yourself
to
the
nearst
store
that
sells
it
and
buy
it
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
would
defintely
purchase
again
hv
poured
as
a
dark
amber
with
a
one
inch
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
the
smell
was
citrusy
the
taste
was
grapefruit
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
like
an
ipa
light
but
without
being
bitter
feel
was
light
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
for
the
tongue
to
play
with
very
drinkable
the
number
one
asset
of
this
beer
overall
i
liked
the
taste
and
i
will
enjoy
again
and
again
reminded
me
of
a
lager
not
in
taste
but
its
ability
to
quench
a
thirst
in
reflection
this
may
be
my
new
standby
brand
for
times
when
i
dont
have
a
great
selection
to
choose
from
displacing
sam
adams
boston
lager
i
despise
hoppy
beers
and
this
was
a
pale
ale
that
won
me
over
a
very
wellbalanced
drinkable
and
flavorful
brew
and
a
pioneer
brand
in
american
microbrewing
to
top
it
all
off
this
is
a
real
easy
drinker
and
with
its
wide
distribution
it
is
a
go
to
for
when
the
options
are
this
and
bmc
if
this
is
what
defines
and
apa
im
ok
with
it
overall
this
is
the
top
american
pale
ale
in
my
book
it
represents
the
style
to
a
tee
and
is
unmatched
by
most
apas
the
taste
is
very
easy
to
drink
there
are
definite
leafy
hops
nothing
too
resinous
or
too
oily
or
too
nouvelle
here
just
solid
and
honest
leafy
hop
there
is
enough
bready
malts
and
a
biscuity
backbone
to
balance
out
the
hop
to
make
it
very
complementary
there
are
some
drying
notes
some
sharper
citrusy
spice
flavors
in
the
beer
too
maybe
a
slight
touch
of
clove
the
beer
is
drier
than
i
remember
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
mild
there
is
a
lingering
hoppy
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
medium
bodied
not
too
thick
not
cloying
very
refreshing
very
solid
there
may
be
a
touch
of
orange
rind
lurking
underneath
as
well
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
very
enjoyable
lchaim
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
a
session
beer
for
craft
brew
lovers
its
one
of
the
hoppiest
commercially
available
beers
on
the
market
and
thats
what
distinguishes
it
in
my
mind
if
you
are
a
pale
ale
lover
its
just
a
matter
of
time
before
youre
tipping
back
on
thicker
ipas
and
porters
overall
a
great
beer
to
use
to
introduce
your
macro
friends
to
craft
and
a
solid
staple
to
fall
back
on
if
you
need
a
relatively
cheap
and
sessionable
craft
brew
unlikely
ill
keep
this
a
staple
in
the
fridge
but
certainly
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
easy
drinking
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
its
a
hoppy
devil
of
a
pale
ale
this
taste
like
your
typical
pale
ale
light
hops
and
citrus
with
a
bitter
end
o
this
is
a
good
go
to
beer
where
faced
with
a
limited
selection
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
friday
night
pizza
pours
a
pretty
shade
of
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
aroma
of
hops
and
some
citrus
light
fruity
flavor
with
a
decent
hop
kick
that
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
not
overwhelmingly
crisp
and
well
balanced
with
a
good
mouth
feel
my
tastes
tend
to
lean
more
to
stouts
but
this
beer
is
going
to
make
me
spend
more
time
exploring
pas
and
ipas
i
think
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
very
easy
to
throw
back
a
bunch
of
these
and
very
refreshing
good
pairing
with
food
or
separate
like
i
said
a
standard
nothing
megaspectacular
but
a
worthy
option
anytime
d
i
love
this
beer
great
price
great
flavor
i
can
drink
this
all
night
an
be
happy
md
a
nice
mediumfull
body
to
this
one
very
clean
and
smooth
as
ive
noted
and
very
drinkable
a
great
summertime
beer
no
doubt
this
beer
is
the
money
maker
with
good
reason
definite
session
beer
right
here
widely
available
and
consistent
d
very
drinkablecould
have
serveral
in
a
session
drinkability
hell
yeah
this
may
be
the
prototypical
apa
but
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
maybe
because
it
straddles
the
apaipa
line
closer
than
most
d
give
me
a
twelve
pack
of
this
and
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
will
be
happy
long
after
the
sun
sets
one
of
the
most
drinkable
craft
beers
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
tastey
and
good
amount
of
alcohol
would
definitely
go
for
a
session
of
this
anyway
it
poured
a
nice
reddish
amber
into
a
pint
glass
with
only
a
slight
head
the
hops
kick
is
nice
but
not
wuite
enough
for
me
there
is
the
regular
citrus
notes
and
the
biting
aftertaste
associated
with
the
style
i
could
and
have
drink
a
dozen
basically
thank
you
sierra
nevada
for
showing
me
the
light
d
so
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
summer
beer
notes
great
beer
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
so
my
review
might
be
a
little
one
sided
would
recommend
this
beer
and
would
buy
again
wish
i
had
more
then
one
of
these
guys
laying
around
great
beer
must
try
very
drinkable
very
balanced
a
classic
that
is
a
staple
in
any
beer
lovers
fridge
i
havent
drank
this
enough
over
the
years
drinks
well
year
round
any
occasion
if
you
spent
much
time
here
at
all
you
already
know
as
i
learned
this
is
a
great
beer
for
those
who
want
to
try
something
good
but
might
not
be
able
to
handle
an
ipa
or
imperial
stout
pours
a
cloudy
peach
body
with
a
big
white
head
fruity
hops
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
orange
caramel
malt
and
spicy
citrus
hops
meet
seamlessly
in
the
classic
apa
good
hop
flavor
moderate
bitterness
excellent
balance
snpa
is
creamy
on
the
finish
with
high
carbonation
snpa
is
the
beer
that
defines
sierra
nevada
and
is
one
of
the
most
historic
and
influential
beers
in
craft
beers
meteoric
rise
as
the
number
of
quality
american
breweries
has
exploded
this
beer
may
not
be
as
greatly
superior
or
unique
as
it
once
was
but
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
that
serves
as
the
model
against
which
all
apas
can
be
judged
despite
all
of
the
challenges
imposed
by
the
serving
i
enjoyed
sn
pa
and
will
look
for
it
again
and
uodate
my
review
d
the
beer
that
launced
a
thousand
hoppedup
west
coast
pale
ales
nonetheless
its
position
as
the
best
beer
available
at
the
average
bar
is
pretty
much
unassailable
i
always
pass
the
24
ounce
bootle
when
i
grocery
shop
and
today
i
finally
decided
to
buy
one
and
see
what
it
was
like
i
have
become
a
huge
fan
of
the
torpedo
and
i
wanted
to
branch
out
and
see
what
else
they
offered
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
for
better
or
worse
i
have
become
a
huge
hop
fan
therefore
the
hoppier
the
beer
the
better
but
this
is
just
as
good
as
any
of
those
hop
bombs
i
see
this
beer
alot
when
i
go
out
to
chain
restaurants
and
i
am
excited
to
now
have
another
beverage
option
when
i
eat
at
those
places
this
will
make
it
into
my
regular
rotation
when
i
need
a
break
from
the
stronger
presence
beers
d
my
fist
craft
beer
and
always
a
standby
when
out
at
a
bar
or
restaurant
you
can
almost
never
go
wrong
with
snpa
this
is
a
very
earthy
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
to
drink
i
havent
tried
many
sierra
nevada
beers
but
im
looking
forward
to
more
makes
for
a
wonderful
summer
beer
i
used
to
love
this
beer
but
boy
do
times
change
it
is
still
a
solid
beer
but
if
this
is
the
gateway
beer
i
think
the
craft
party
might
lose
some
after
trying
this
sierra
nevada
is
one
of
the
beers
that
turned
me
onto
beer
it
has
such
welldefined
characteristics
it
nearly
defines
or
possibly
actually
defines
the
style
of
american
pale
ale
the
refreshing
drinkability
and
not
in
the
miller
lite
sense
either
meshes
so
well
with
the
malt
and
hop
to
yield
something
that
has
become
a
classic
it
seems
that
with
sierra
nevada
you
really
can
not
go
wrong
the
same
can
be
said
for
their
pale
ale
clear
no
sedament
not
that
i
mind
that
and
good
taste
this
is
definatley
one
of
my
fall
back
beers
on
sunday
night
at
11

i

to
travel

nothing
bad
either
and
was
even
turned
off
on
other
apas
and
one
i
will
definitely
get
again
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
drinking
several
of
way
better
than
expected
the
body
was
light
and
the
beer
was
very
refreshing
maybe
slightly
over
carbonated
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
session
beers
ever
created

golden
small

throughout
smelled
slightly

this

flavor
was
not

intense
as
i
recall
but
carried
a
nice
pleasant

bitterness
otherwise
balanced
drank
cleanly

nice

taste
is
a
quick
burst
of

followed
by

dry
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
as
its
very
drinkable
surprisingly
hoppy
for
an

more
like
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
a
quality
beer
nonetheless
poured
into

poured
12
inch
of
bright
white
head
that
left
a
medium
amount
of
lacing
bright

orangedeep
yellow
color
not
much
malt
in
the
nose
but
solid
hop
presence
flavor
matches
aroma
closely
the
lack
of
body
is
noticed
right
away
very
drinkable
but
the
flavors
becomes
unnoticeable
quickly
this
is
a
solid
goto
beer
that
never
lets
you
down
but
rarely
thrills
the
drinker
i
have
long
maintained
that
due
to
the
prominence
of
hops
and
lack
of
malt
body
this
should
be
called
an
ipa
not
a
pale
ale
i
seem
to
be
in
a
very
small
minority
in
this
view
a
straw
colored
yellow
thick
pillowy
head
with
lacing
streaming
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
a
less
hoppy
smell
than
i
remember
in
past
tastings
taste
is
quite
crisp
with
a
strong
malt
profile
to
balance
the
hops
the
hops
really
give
a
good
clean
bitterness
towards
the
end
but
not
overwhelming
light
clear
orange
pouring
from
the
bottle
and
in
the
glass
fizzy
appearance
with
a
light
head
no
haze
at
all
piney
hops
in
the
nose
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
with
just
a
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
this
is
just
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
definitely
the
standard
by
which
pale
ales
should
be
judged
liked
everything
about
this
beer
except
the
flavor
and
it
goes
without
saying
i
wouldnt
or
couldnt
attempt
this
ever
again
it
definitely
isnt
as
exciting
and
hoppy
as
some
other
pale
ales
but
it
is
always
consistent
and
that
counts
for
something
overall
as
far
as
apas
go
this
is
one
i
could
sit
down
with
more
so
than
the
others
ive
had
not
too
bitter
but
represents
the
style
well
d
a
refreshing
brew
that
is
delightfully
simple
as
stated
earlier
the
bitterness
is
initially
pleasant
however
it
seemed
to
wear
on
me
after
awhile
nonetheless
the
taste
was
still
pleasing
very
drinkable
and
would
definitely
have
another
to
refresh
would
have
liked
something
a
bit
more
interesting
but
overall
very
drinkable
d
i
loved
this
beer
and
i
cant
believe
i
only
have
one
i
am
drinking
it
at
a
fairly
warm
temperate
of
55
and
it
is
going
down
way
to
fast
still
maybe
a
little
too
light
this
beer
would
still
be
incredible
to
drink
for
taste
as
well
as
quenching
my
thirst
after
a
strenuous
activity
like
i
said
before
this
beer
could
be
stronger
i
feel
as
though
i
could
drink
it
in
3
sips
and
not
be
satisfied
after
just
one
that
being
said
i
wish
i
could
drink
3
more
right
now
i
love
this
beer
overall
its
quite
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
its
worth
trying
out
if
you
dont
have
any
craft
beer
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
light
body
no
warmth
no
creaminess
slight
carbonic
bite
due
to
high
carbonation
with
little
malt
drinkability
why
not
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
the
taps
have
no
other
macros
available
or
micros
for
that
matter
its
also
the
goto
beer
when
all
other
stores
are
out
of
the
loop
by
all
means
an
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
never
disappoints
i
often
look
over
this
beer
at
the
store
while
searching
for
something
else
but
then
once
i
get
home
a
pour
this
beautiful
concoction
into
a
welcoming
glass
i
realize
the
reliable
snpa
will
always
be
inviting
when
i
call
her
name
really
solid
pale
ale
decent
atmosphere
not
a
very
complex
flavor
but
good
for
hopheads
does
have
a
bit
of
a
metallic
feel
but
good
drinkability
highly
drinkable
refreshing
tasty
overall
why
have
i
not
picked
this
up
before
i
guess
because
of
its
widespread
availability
i
didnt
take
it
to
be
a
good
craft
brew
at
a
price
thats
only
slightly
higher
than
bmcs
for
a
sixer
this
is
one
deal
thats
hard
to
give
up
very
solid
beer
i
love
this
beer
it
was
my
gateway
beer
to
craft
beer
and
i
regard
it
as
a
quintessesntial
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
it
absolutely
sets
the
standard
drinkability
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
not
sure
why
as
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
hops
nikki
very
drinkable
but
not
my
favorites
not
exactly
what
i
call
fuul
flavored
kinda
mild
for
me
but
decent
none
the
less
light
honey
amber
with
some
suspended
yeast
particles
patchy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
decent
thin
collar
of
foam
leaving
fine
lace
down
the
glass
smells
like
fresh
leafy
cascade
hops
with
mild
citrus
notes
and
doughy
yeast
tastes
mild
and
hoppy
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
that
smoothes
it
out
nicely
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
the
old
standby
for
a
reason
its
really
good
greatclassic
beer
i
have
had
this
pale
ale
many
times
and
just
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
it
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
immediate
aroma
that
i
detect
is
a
floralpiney
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
smooth
with
acceptable
bitterness
and
subtle
malt
characteristics
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
finish
i
could
drink
these
through
out
the
evening
and
be
very
satisfied
not
an
overly
hopped
or
sweet
apa
this
is
a
great
beer
a
dark
orange
pour
with
a
nice
12
head
s
hoppy
citrus
t
distinctly
sierra
taste
hoppy
bite
with
a
citrusy
flavor
very
crisp
and
that
sierra
bite
m
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
just
the
right
blend
of
hops
and
citrus
d
i
could
easily
sit
through
a
sixer
in
a
night
or
steadily
drink
them
at
the
bar
overall
enjoyable
one
i
wont
hesitate
to
pick
up
from
time
to
time
for
sure
good
drinking
crisp
and
balanced
hops
and
malt
in
that
livey
fresh
style
that
i
find
typical
of
californian
beers
highly
carbonated
but
not
innapropriate
makes
me
want
to
mow
a
lawn
great
for
introducing
people
to
the
style
i
am
going
to
introduce
my
father
to
apas
with
a
bottle
of
sierra
nevada
tonight
d
by
style
one
of
the
best
crisp
refreshing
with
a
great
malting
and
true
to
style
case
worthy
by
all
means
a
go
to
for
that
summer
picnic
to
quench
the
thirst
with
a
citrusy
blast
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
an
apa
obviously
no
one
needs
me
to
tell
them
that
a
fine
rock
band
beer
too
i
would
never
ever
feel
bad
about
this
being
in
my
fridge
drinkability
overall
an
excellent
beer
kind
of
the
staple
for
its
kind
probably
one
of
the
most
available
craft
beers
out
there
d
the
crispness
ultimately
wins
out
over
what
im
perceiving
as
thinness
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
just
slightly
high
on
the
abv
to
be
a
session
beer
i
suppose
but
still
one
of
which
id
have
a
few
in
a
row
given
its
availability
this
ought
to
be
a
staple
for
any
beer
drinker
to
keep
on
hand
or
at
least
an
excellent
fallback
option
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
good
beer
that
is
eaasy
to
find
could
be
a
daily
drinker
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
i
usually
prefer
highly
bitter
ipas
but
if
i
wanted
something
with
bitterness
that
was
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
d
this
one
is
a
classic
and
with
is
relatively
easy
to
find
at
most
bars
and
some
restaurants
even
in
mississippi
i
always
have
a
few
of
these
either
in
the
cabinet
or
in
the
fridge
a
goto
pale
ale
always
good
always
available
pours
clear
copper
with
a
short
white
head
clean
fresh
floral
hop
aroma
with
shrap
crystal
malt
taste
is
representative
of
the
aroma
citrus
hops
taking
a
back
seat
to
the
tangier
malt
would
rather
drink
an
alesmith
brew
but
im
not
going
to
whine
if
this
is
my
only
option
overall
a
solid
beer
and
definitely
a
goto
choice
when
at
a
restaurant
with
otherwise
only
crappy
macros
a
classic
of
the
style
sometimes
i
forget
how
good
these
old
reliables
really
are
d
i
really
like
this
beer
hoppy
with
a
nice
full
body
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
with
a
good
off
white
head
that
does
not
last
very
long
very
fine
bubbles
throughout
the
smell
is
floral
and
citrusy
fantastic
bitter
hop
taste
but
not
too
overpowering
dry
finish
with
hoppy
aftertaste
very
drinkable
ale
pours
a
bit
darker
than
expected
looks
wonderful
smells
hoppy
with
hints
of
citrus
fruit
taste
is
malty
very
citrusy
crisp
incredibly
easy
to
drink
this
gets
me
excited
for
sierra
nevadas
ipa
really
complete
excellent
tasting
beer
thats
unbelievably
easy
to
drink
alevel
beer
didnt
notice
too
much
of
a
difference
from
the
bottle
to
be
honest
ah
sn
pale
ale
what
can
you
say
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
between
hops
and
caramel
appearance
is
light
copper
with
a
white
head
flavor
is
hoppy
and
balanced
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
hoppy
finishing
clean
overall
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
i
drink
this
beer
every
chance
i
get
d
its
hard
to
have
this
much
flavor
at

this
is
one
you
can
enjoy

so
remember
next
time
your

a
sierra

good
beer

its
a
no
brainer
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
dry
feel
to
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
d

for
me
i
can
find
this
anywhere
and
i
can
drink
this
anytime
drinkability
very
very
drinkable

that
is
clean
and
refreshing
the
pour
is

the

is
bitter
and
dry
overall
very
good
pale

although
i
will
have
to
say
that
is
pale
ale
has
an
assault
on
your
palate
drinkability
a
good
drinkable
beer
allaround
definitely
something
ill
go
for
in
the
future
might
be
something
ill
have
around
for
parties
cant
believe
i
passed
on
this
beer
for
so
long
drinkability
a
solid
pale
ale
by
sierra
nevada
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
beer
noobs
or
beer
advocates
in
general
peace
out
d
very
drinkable
ale
not
too
hoppy
and
a
rather
smooth
brew
my
first
advice
to
myself
if
and
when
i
start
homebrewing
is
to
break
into
sierra
nevada
after
hours
and
steal
all
their
ingredients
im
positive
my
beer
will
be
stunning
if
i
do
even
if
i
end
up
microwaving
it
and
stirring
the
wort
in
an
unwashed
kettle
in
which
i
cooked
beef
stew
three
days
ago
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
from
sn
that
will
continue
to
get
praise
behind
celebration
ale
this
is
the
best
dose
of
good
hops
ive
had
in
a
while
a
creeper
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
in
my
book
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
decent
head
with
little
retention
and
little
lacing
smells
strongly
of
hops
fits
the
pale
ale
style
quite
nicely
strong
bitterness
of
hops
with
average
carbonation
could
have
a
little
more
flavor
but
overall
very
good
beer
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
pretty
headand
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
pleasant
hoppy
aroma
like
walking
the
smell
of
a
christmas
tree
the
beer
is
crisp
with
mild
pine
accents
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
mild
piney
aftertaste
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
this
is
the
apa
all
others
should
be
compared
to
overall
a
very
well
rounded
beer
and
one
of
the
ones
that
got
me
interested
in
craft
brews
d
i
do
not
think
of
myself
as
a
hophead
and
read
that
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
ipas
i
certainly
get
the
bitter
flavor
but
enjoyed
the
fruitiness
i
assume
the
bitter
aftertaste
is
what
the
hopheads
enjoy
this
was
a
an
enjoyable
beer
and
certainly
can
be
followed
by
a
few
more
i
can
see
this
one
catching
up
to
you
after
a
few
d
great
beer
all
around
we
just
finished
off
a
keg
of
this
and
we
might
need
to
get
another
not
really
an
aftertaste
with
perfect
carbonation
reviewed

bottle
pours
amber
with
a
small
white

of

not
that
it
smells
like
soap
just
the
flowery
notes
of
some

taste
of

some
spices
an
excellent

the
best
beer
on
tap
at
lots
of
places
that
otherwise
offer
very
little
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
has
to
be
the
top
american
ale
to
start
off
on
if
your
getting
into
craft
beer
i
wont
leave
this
behind
either
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
i
could
find
myself
enjoying
35
of
these
on
any
occasion
i
cant
get
over
those
dry
citruspine
notes
and
that
dominate
hop
bitterness
nice
and
rich
the
flavors
marry
so
well
together
very
decently
priced
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
everyone
must
try
this
even
if
you
must
seek
to
find
believe
me
its
worth
it
cheers
on
tap
the
taste
is
really
rather
bland
with
just
some
hops
mostly
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
plus
a
light
grain
quality
that
mostly
takes
over
in
the
end
the
brew
pours
with
about
a
finger
of
good
persistent
head
which
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
color
is
a
rich
golden
hue
which
is
a
bit
pale
due
to
the
unfiltered
suspended
particles
taste
is
clean
crisp
and
fresh
with
a
definite
hop
character
malts
are
subdued
but
lend
some
balance
to
the
flavor
taste
does
finish
with
touch
of
dryness
mouthfeel
is
light
which
equates
with
a
high
drinkability
and
the
carbonation
is
just
about
right
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
really
good
mouthfeel
not
overcarbonated
which
is
often
the
biggest
turn
off
for
me
in
a
pale
ale
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
because
its
a
rather
solid
brew
with
an
unashamed
hop
presence
another
great
beer
from
snbc
and
one
of
my
standby
apas
clear
bronze
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
that
lasts
a
bit
a
little
lacing
a
nice
floralcitrus
hop
aromaa
little
spice
flavor
is
citrus
hopspine
and
a
caramel
malt
backbone
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
big
hop
pale
alevery
drinkable
and
enjoyable
medium
bodied
smooth
feel
nicely
carbonated
quite
frankly
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
apa
i
usually
pass
it
up
in
the
store
in
search
of
anything
new
or
different
but
im
glad
i
snagged
a
sixer
tonight
d
super
high
my
goto
beer
and
breakfest
drink
of
choice
i
had
this
while
eating
mexican
food
it
really
went
well
with
the
spice
hot
nachos
i
enjoyed
the
beer
this
time
so
much
so
that
i
had
two
el
gordo
glasses
22ounce
and
got
to
take
home
to
sierra
nevada
logo
glasses
one
to
always
have
in
the
fridge
also
the
perfect
beer
with
which
to
turn
macro
drinkers
on
the
the
good
stuff
citrusy
aroma
with
some
slight
hop
bitterness
taste
is
similar
crisp
and
refreshing
with
slightly
sweet
citrus
notes
ending
with
alcohol
warmth
and
hop
bitterness
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
as
it
should
be
a
wonderful
apa
however
i
dont
if
it
is
the
best
although
it
may
be
considered
a
classic
d
this
beer
has
some
serious
drinkability
it
has
a
really
good
flavor
that
is
not
overpowering
but
is
smooth
and
refreshing
great
beer
first
time
trying
it
but
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
sometime
should
be
on
everyones
list
of
a
beer
to
try
at
least
once
sierra
nevada
is
rightfully
regarded
as
the
grandfather
of
the
american
craft
beer
revolution
their
pale
ale
was
particularly
inspirational
for
a
generation
of
craft
brewers
that
were
now
reinventing
old
world
styles
and
hopping
at
levels
previously
unheard
of
all
hail
it
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
light
copperbronze
color
with
a
one
finger
head
it
has
a
pleasing
citrus
hoppy
aroma
that
i
really
like
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
am
i
tasting
orange
in
this
beer
finishes
dry
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
wow
im
impressed
with
this
beers
nice
flavor
may
be
the
perfect
better
beer
for
newbies
due
to
the
decent
amount
of
hops
and
easy
drinkability
a
fine
apa
which
seems
to
be
available
in
many
walmarts
and
winn
dixies
across
alabama
pours
golden
amber
with
a
tight
beige
head
that
falls
to
a
nice
lace
nose
is
pine
with
biscuty
malt
then
follows
to
a
slight
citrus
hops
are
spicy
fruity
and
floral
while
the
cascade
bitterness
lasts
throughout
the
tasting
to
the
back
of
the
throat
with
easy
carbonation
so
many
flavors
in
this
brew
and
is
so
drinkable
the
granddaddy
of
pas
never
fails
this
one
is
especially
fresh
and
bright
tasting
likely
due
to
the
foottraffic
hog
island
receives
keep
rolling
those
kegs
overall
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
there
or
in
the
absence
of
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
am
not
going
to
seek
it
out
i
suppose
i
am
not
quite
as
impressed
as
i
should
be
given
its
reputation
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
easily
sessionable
refreshing
very
nice
carbonation
and
a
very
nice
piney
aftertaste
due
to
the
overall
availability
of
this
beer
it
has
become
my
session
beer
of
choice
as
of
late
i
can
get
it
at
any
liquorgrocery
store
and
a
good
majority
of
bars
around
here
carry
it
as
well
d
awesome
great
for
watching
a
game
and
relaxing
after
a
long
kayaking
trip
the
classic
pale
ale
i
have
had
this
may
times
before
but
i
just
had
one
last
night
and
it
reminded
me
how
much
i
really
like
it
i
had
it
on
tap
and
it
pours
with
a
beautiful
head
nice
deep
golden
color
with
nice
fulffy
white
head
the
scent
is
very
strong
with
the
hops
but
the
taste
is
balanced
when
you
drink
it
its
a
great
hot
day
beer
or
for
tailgating
it
can
be
used
in
alot
of
diffrent
recipes
and
goes
great
with
a
wide
variety
of
food
this
isnt
the
best
beer
on
the
market
but
proably
the
best
american
pale
ale
i
love
the
drinkablity
and
i
will
continue
to
drnk
this
when
i
have
the
chance
to
overall
a
solid
standby
beer
one
i
dont
mind
having
around
at
all
times
one
good
pale
poured
a
orange
color
with
a
fingerwidth
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
as
you
drink
scent
is
surprisingly
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
thought
lots
of
fruit
and
a
woodygrassy
aroma
i
couldnt
place
palate
is
crisp
clean
and
very
dry
not
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
pales
and
ipas
you
get
a
slight
hop
burn
on
the
tongue
but
its
balanced
enough
to
let
the
grapefruit
and
spices
come
through
perhaps
the
definition
of
sessionable
in
my
opinion
refreshing
even
more
so
when
thinking
about
having
a
few
of
these
after
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
made
me
realize
that
i
love
hops
i
remember
being
13
and
going
to
my
yuppie
aunt
and
uncles
house
for
holidays
and
they
would
always
have
this
in
the
fridge
needless
to
say
it
was
love
at
first
sip
piney
hops
on
the
tongue
too
bit
of
malt
in
the
back
goes
down
well
classic
beer
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
session
beers
imo
d
a
classic
ale
and
it
had
been
way
too
long
since
i
had
one
on
tap
easily
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
drinkability
not
too
heavy
relatively
low
abv
and
tastes
fine
could
go
through
a
few
with
ease
highly
drinkable
and
very
well
balanced
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
is
a
perfect
session
beer
and
would
make
a
superb
entry
into
the
world
of
craft
brew
for
any
of
the
uninitiated
it
has
a
really
nice
balance
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
in
fact
i
was
recently
talking
with
a
friend
of
mine
about
what
beer
we
would
choose
if
we
could
have
an
unlimited
supply
of
only
one
beer
for
consumption
while
trapped
on
a
desert
island
this
was
my
choice
dsessionable
and
refreshing
love
this
beer
because
it
is
everywhere
d
never
really
cared
for
their
stuff
this
is
overated
but
drinkable
i
just
associate
it
with
the
90s
when
you
would
ask
people
if
they
were
into
good
beer
and
they
would
say
they
loved
sierra
nevada
decent
but
better
stuff
out
there
for
half
the
price
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
before
but
never
reviewed
it
now
that
its
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
it
i
figured
id
get
to
reviewing
now
i
remember
why
i
used
to
buy
it
all
the
time
time
to
get
more
another
great
job
from
sierra
nevada
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer
by
these
guys
all
are
solid
get
some
if
you
never
had
it
overall
this
will
continue
to
sit
near
the
top
of
my
favorite
beers
a
good
beer
for
a
lovely
sunny
fall
day
this
is
a
great
apa
i
usually
go
to
ipas
but
this
ale
is
good
enough
to
stand
up
to
some
of
the
best
pours
nice
decent
head
nice
nose
lots
of
hop
character
not
usually
found
in
this
style
of
ale
very
nicely
bitter
finish
there
is
no
way
not
to
like
this
ale
it
tastes
great
is
very
drinkable
and
is
very
friendly
on
the
wallet
when
you
compare
it
to
ipas
and
dipas
every
product
ive
tried
from
this
family
of
beer
and
ales
has
been
superb
id
say
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
this
being
my
second
one
tonight
actually
it
goes
down
smooth
and
tasty
friends
of
mine
all
found
it
to
their
liking
when
i
let
them
taste
it
as
well
over
the
last
month
i
have
chosen
mainly
imported
beers
that
get
great
grades
on
this
very
site
this
pale
ale
did
not
disappoint
my
goodness
i
have
tasted
way
harsher
pale
ales
d
a
nice
pale
ale
pretty
much
the
definition
of
the
style
solid
and
a
worthy
of
a
staple
very
drinkable
and
a
good
ale
all
around
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
a
12
pack
in
the
fridge
pretty
regularly
what
else
am
i
supposed
to
say
to
fill
up
250
characters
the
beers
great
go
try
it
took
me
a
while
to
finally
try
this
one
but
i
did
it
and
found
a
great
drinkable
beer
has
a
unique
characteristic
taste
to
it
that
must
be
from
different
types
of
hops
no
usually
used
on
the
east
coast
its
crisp
refreshing
very
well
balanced
if
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
this
is
an
exceedingly
drinkable
beer
in
fact
i
plan
on
finishing
my
six
pack
in
the
next
few
hours
as
i
enjoy
the
afternoon
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
craft
beers
out
there
full
of
flavor
and
pretty
unoffensive
a
great
standby
d
nice
interplay
of
hop
bite
and
sweetness
flavours
not
overpowering
and
this
makes
for
a
sessionable
yet
interesting
ale
a
winner
this
is
probably
many
bas
gateway
beer
this
wasnt
my
first
craft
brew
but
it
was
about
my
favorite
great
beer
that
should
be
shared
with
as
many
people
as
possible
dthis
one
has
given
me
many
a
headache
which
earns
it
a
5
in
drinkability
d
very
high
all
day
with
any
food
d
this
makes
for
a
perfect
goto
beer
it
is
also
a
hoppier
version
of
a
pale
ale
but
the
increased
hops
works
well
in
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
staples
when
i
am
out
at
bars
without
much
variety
always
a
good
choice
this
is
the
pale
ale
most
breweries
try
to
replicate
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
foamy
one
finger
head
that
leaves
some
nice
thick
heavy
lace
smell
is
pretty
malty
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
hop
smell
in
the
nose
but
the
malt
was
overwhelming
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
goes
down
very
well
a
nice
balance
with
the
hop
and
the
malt
not
overpowering
but
a
nice
solid
flavor
of
earth
and
citrus
i
have
had
this
beer
alot
and
have
never
reviewed
it
this
is
a
classic
that
should
be
in
everyones
beer
refrig
truly
an
amazing
product
from
an
amzing
brewer
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
session
beer
if
i
have
ever
had
one
what
with
the
generally
low
abv
comparatively
and
the
tastiness
i
am
looking
forward
to
making
the
original
recipe
that
you
can
find
in
papazians
book
this
light
amber
brew
throws
out
dense
white
head
that
creates
a
nice
lacing
throughout
the
entire
beer
there
is
a
wonderful
blast
of
hops
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
follows
this
same
trend
great
hop
character
with
a
fantastic
understated
bitterness
underlying
malt
is
sufficient
pretty
clean
tasting
for
an
ale
this
is
one
that
is
good
to
go
all
night
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
it
has
the
requisite
bite
pale
color
low
abv
but
its
a
bit
more
obvious
less
refined
that
the
class
of
the
apa
field
but
a
good
beer
to
go
sip
around
a
bonfire
on
a
warm
fall
night
which
is
what
i
will
be
doing
in
roughly
five
minutes
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
i
just
think
it
is
over
rated
a
bit
lots
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
not
much
malt
balance
if
that
is
your
thing
then
its
all
good
its
not
mine
though
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
as
a
fall
back
when
nothing
else
good
was
around
i
was
eating
various
cheese
cubes
and
mashed
potatoes
but
this
would
have
been
good
on
its
own
i
think
good
beer
this
was
one
of
my
first
beers
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
great
pale
ale
md
medium
bodied
easily
drinkable
hops
are
a
little
strong
for
an
apa
but
i
consider
that
a
good
thing
poured
to
my
pint
glass
from
12oz
bottle
cloudy
amber
color
with
good
carbonation
and
nice
head
smells
of
nutscitrus
hops
alittle
sweet
malts
tastes
of
pine
and
hops
and
malts
top
it
off
lightmedium
body
this
has
a
good
drinkability
beer
that
is
readily
available
id
get
this
again
overall
this
is
very
nice
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
very
drinkable
overall
thanks
to
the
lowish
abv
something
i
could
actually
drink
all
night
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
floral
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
grapefruit
and
a
slight
sourness
the
aftertaste
is
nicely
sour
and
bitter
a
good
brew
3
5
d
a
bit
onedimensional
but
can
be
worth
having
two
during
a
session
the
wide
availability
means
it
can
on
occassion
save
you
from
having
something
very
bad
at
a
bar
or
restaurant
drinkability
very
high
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
my
go
to
at
bars
with
a
dubious
beer
menu
what
a
great
solid
beer
clean
and
refreshing
for
any
season
a
real
drinker
here
which
is
scary
classic
apa
all
the
way
it
isnt
the
best
pale
ale
on
the
planet
but
it
is
timeless
and
tasty
i
would
gladly
shell
out
my
money
for
this
brew
anytime
good
stuff
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
medium
yelloworange
color
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
almost
all
hops
with
some
pine
and
citrus
flavor
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
bitter
spicy
hops
very
well
balanced
good
pale
ale
finishes
astringent
and
dry
on
tongue
an
easy
goto
beer
when
the
best
beer
you
can
get
within
an
hour
drive
is
sn
or
rogue
drinkability
for
me
is
decenthowever
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
prefer
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
for
a
relatively
higher
hopped
beer
this
beer
does
alright
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
really
like
to
drink
a
few
when
i
choose
to
drink
them
a
great
standby
beer
when
i
cant
decide
on
anything
d
this
is
pretty
refreshing
beer
good
for
hot
afternoons
i
would
excitedly
have
it
again
this
is
the
standard
for
american
pale
ales
and
what
they
all
should
try
to
live
up
to
a
great
thirst
quencher
and
summer
beer
this
one
is
going
on
regular
rotation
in
my
fridge
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
only
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
big
on
citrus
hops
with
grapefruit
up
front
and
a
hint
of
pine
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
with
a
big
citrus
hop
bite
up
front
before
giving
way
to
the
malt
backbone
there
is
a
little
pine
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fresh
and
clean
with
good
carbonation
but
a
tad
light
for
my
liking
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
mainstream
beers
out
there
and
one
that
i
order
frequently
when
theres
not
a
lot
else
available
good
stuff
on
tap
out
of
the
bottle
i
always
enjoy
this
beer
copper
color
with
moderate
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
a
bit
floral
nicely
hopped
with
grapefruit
moderate
bitterness
and
some
sweet
malt
for
a
nicely
balanced
beer
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
probably
easy
to
find
for
most
people
strong
hoppy
aroma
with
a
floral
hint
copper
color
pours
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
shows
great
retention
delicate
bubbles
leave
good
lacing
too
medium
bodied
and
bitter
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
smooth
and
refreshing
the
light
carbonation
makes
you
want
to
savor
it
and
swish
it
around
in
your
mouth
this
is
a
good
beer
you
can
see
why
its
their
flagship
and
you
could
easily
drink
it
all
night
pretty
amazing
how
sn
can
brew
so
much
of
this
and
keep
the
quality
this
high
prost
d
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
had
had
one
of
these
a
great
pale
ale
but
not
as
great
as
i
remembered
i
think
that
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
4th
of
july
picnic
or
a
baseball
game
highly
drinkable
well
worth
seeking
out
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
session
beer
as
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
sixpack
in
a
sitting
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
at
5
6
abv
but
definitely
not
overwhelming
very
strong
hop
flavor
a
great
ale
i
got
a
six
pack
of
this
from
my
dad
for
my
21st
birthday
up
there
with
samuel
adams
as
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
beers
i
usually
like
the
european
imports
myself
but
this
beer
can
give
them
competition
d
i
bought
a
12
pack
for
the
dmb
concert
and
they
went
down
smooth
and
very
easy
flavorful
and
easy
to
put
down
as
a
summer
beer
very
good
brew
can
drink
plenty
of
these
quite
the
find
this
one
wasrecommended
by
the
waiter
at
the
sheraton
restaraunt
just
outside
disneylanda
medium
amber
colorwith
a
bubbly
creamy
off
white
head
that
left
some
sticky
lacinga
great
scent
of
citrussome
pinenice
hoppy
aroma
to
it
taste
was
a
great
blend
of
hops
and
malts
also
hinted
of
citrus
some
grapefruit
and
very
nice
spicy
touch
to
it
medium
mouthfeel
to
this
one
all
going
down
rather
nicelycant
get
this
one
in
my
areawill
try
this
one
again
next
time
i
come
across
itvery
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
probably
my
favorite
casual
drinker
i
can
always
finish
off
the
night
with
one
of
these
i
love
the
taste
not
extreme
but
there
is
definitely
something
going
on
with
every
sip
excellent
taste
and
drinkability
im
not
blown
away
by
the
smell
or
appearance
so
much
but
then
again
for
me
its
a
casual
drinker
and
i
always
recommend
it
and
honestly
i
want
just
as
much
out
of
a
casual
drink
than
anything
else
it
has
to
taste
good
and
this
pale
ale
definitely
does
d
pretty
decent
personally
i
found
several
other
pales
more
drinkable
but
this
is
a
good
stand
by
and
usually
readily
available
overall
good
stuff
d
it
doesnt
get
much
more
drinkable
then
this
hop
heads
appreciate
it
and
even
those
just
starting
to
get
into
hops
can
find
it
flavorful
good
to
introduce
to
friends
thta
dont
regularly
get
good
beer
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
20
years
i
have
tried
so
many
other
beers
all
over
the
spectrum
all
over
the
world
i
always
cant
wait
to
get
back
to
my
home
in
n
california
to
have
a
couple
contrary
to
the
beer
tasting
advice
i
like
them
iced
since
i
met
my
wife
ten
years
ago
there
has
only
been
a
couple
of
times
we
have
been
without
overall
if
you
havent
tried
this
try
it
but
really
who
hasnt
its
a
little
better
on
tap
than
what
ive
had
from
the
bottle
looks
prettier
and
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
subdued
and
crisper
definitely
worth
a
try
on
tap
if
youve
only
had
it
from
a
bottle
if
youve
never
tried
it
then
definitely
try
it
be
it
from
a
tap
or
from
a
bottle
recommended
definitely
a
nice
surprise
i
had
a
feeling
this
ale
would
be
good
but
not
this
good
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
decent
creamy
head
and
an
abundance
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
highly
hopped
with
a
nice
malt
scent
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
filling
with
an
unbelievably
smooth
crisp
finish
the
flavor
is
the
perfect
balance
of
bittering
hops
and
malts
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
great
standard
for
the
pale
ale
style
and
an
exceptional
example
golden
in
colour
great
clarity
for
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
and
an
ample
white
head
big
hop
aroma
up
front
tangerines
and
rockmelons
with
the
malt
peeking
through
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
firm
hop
slap
up
front
with
all
the
fruitiness
of
the
aroma
which
gives
way
to
a
wonderfully
round
bready
malt
flavour
the
bitterness
is
well
balanced
and
gives
a
crisp
end
to
the
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
middle
to
thin
with
the
carbonation
just
a
bit
high
for
my
liking
this
combines
with
the
relatively
high
abv
to
inhibit
the
drinkability
for
me
this
beer
comes
with
quite
a
reputation
and
im
happy
to
say
it
lives
up
to
it
a
great
example
of
an
apa
able
to
showcase
the
hops
whilst
allowing
the
malt
to
shine
through
too
maybe
im
become
too
much
of
a
snob
but
i
cant
say
that
this
is
a
beer
to
seek
out
clearly
its
everywhere
so
nobody
really
needs
to
put
any
effort
into
it
if
this
is
on
tap
and
not
much
else
is
then
enjoy
if
youre
at
a
place
with
500
beers
you
might
want
to
try
something
a
bit
more
interesting
this
beer
pours
a
nice
semi
cloudy
amber
with
beautiful
carbonation
in
it
with
atleast
two
fingers
of
head
the
smell
is
mild
of
nuts
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
smoothe
of
a
nice
well
balanced
pale
ale
you
can
not
compare
this
beer
to
alpha
king
pale
ale
but
it
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
i
was
worried
about
the
mouthfeel
since
the
carbonation
looked
high
but
you
barely
notice
it
when
you
drink
it
and
its
an
incredibly
smoothe
beer
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
nothing
about
it
would
slow
you
down
well
done
and
i
look
forward
to
more
d
really
good
brew
for
a
majorly
produced
micro
it
really
does
deliver
and
really
impressed
me
for
the
amount
of
beer
they
pump
out
sierra
nevada
is
about
10
bucks
a
sixer
here
and
i
tend
to
stay
away
from
it
because
i
can
get
some
good
brews
for
about
2
bucks
less
around
here
sill
this
is
a
good
beer
and
my
opinions
are
changing
this
was
actually
one
of
my
first
beers
in
the
craft
brew
realm
some
15
years
ago
i
saw
it
on
tap
a
local
hangout
and
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
ive
been
drinking
it
ever
since
so
i
figured
i
might
as
well
put
in
my
two
cents
its
a
great
looking
beer
with
a
good
sized
head
that
laces
down
the
glass
as
the
beer
is
finished
what
i
love
most
is
the
smell
of
this
pale
ale
with
its
pinycitrusy
hop
aroma
balanced
with
malt
goodness
this
taste
is
usually
great
though
there
are
times
where
i
noticed
pronounced
differences
in
the
beer
from
batch
to
batch
ive
found
that
this
beer
can
be
quite
variable
in
aroma
and
taste
usually
it
hits
the
spot
perfectly
i
had
it
with
sliced
bbq
beef
brisket
at
joeys
in
pomona
and
it
complimented
and
held
up
quite
nicely
the
smokiness
and
tangy
sweetness
of
the
bbq
sauce
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
notes
the
drinkability
deserves
the
tag
that
bud
light
uses
superior
drinkability
session
beer
for
sure
and
a
beer
more
than
worthy
of
stocking
up
on
for
the
summer
months
good
brew
a
nice
copper
colored
body
with
a
small
short
lived
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
has
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
with
some
bready
malt
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
the
hops
and
a
malt
profile
that
supports
the
flavors
nicely
has
a
lively
carbonation
that
leaves
a
crisp
finish
a
apa
that
can
found
at
most
places
and
a
worthy
goto
beer
dthough
not
a
knockout
in
flavor
the
clean
finish
makes
it
easy
to
keep
sipping
the
brew
blended
well
with
my
meal
and
i
had
no
problems
downing
24oz
in
a
sitting
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
that
could
definitely
be
sessioned
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
sierra
nevada
drinkability
well
balanced
but
the
hops
make
it
just
a
few
before
im
ready
for
a
change
pours
a
very
nice
copper
color
with
nice
head
and
good
lacing
it
has
a
nice
scent
slightly
floral
and
hoppy
but
its
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
expected
nice
taste
it
had
excellent
american
and
english
virtues
with
a
nice
hoppiness
both
citrus
and
slightly
beef
jerkyish
with
a
mellow
bitter
aftertaste
goes
down
fine
a
good
pale
ale
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
as
well
as
a
legend
in
the
craft
category
i
can
remember
trying
this
beer
for
the
first
time
about
11
yrs
ago
and
although
at
the
time
i
found
it
to
be
extremely
hoppy
times
have
changed
but
i
also
found
it
to
be
a
tremendous
all
around
beer
d
not
as
great
of
an
apa
as
others
i
have
had
but
definitely
a
respectable
apa
that
can
be
enjoyed
almost
anytime
would
make
a
great
session
beer
unless
they
water
down
this
beer
it
will
always
be
one
of
my
default
beers
a
welcome
beer
ill
always
come
back
to
overall
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
apa
d
the
classic
apa
this
is
solid
in
every
aspect
of
the
style
ive
been
drinking
this
one
for
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
cheers
a
true
american
classic
the
american
craft
beer
movement
owes
this
beer
a
debt
of
gratitude
one
im
more
than
happy
to
repay
now
and
again
by
draining
a
glass
damn
thats
a
good
beer
the
initial
hopattack
wipes
all
other
tastes
from
the
palate
clearing
its
way
like
an
invading
army
the
fresh
crisp
taste
that
follows
is
one
welcomed
aftershock
this
beer
also
features
a
characteristic
that
is
hard
to
find
in
most
others
its
highly
drinkable
over
a
period
of
time
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
never
loses
its
allure
throughout
a
day
or
for
that
matter
day
after
day
this
is
a
great
go
to
beer
whether
youre
entertaining
others
on
a
holiday
or
just
want
something
to
sip
on
during
the
nba
finals
every
swig
leaves
you
wanting
more
of
the
bitter
yet
fresh
and
satisfying
taste
of
this
beer
its
very
consistent
and
the
alcoholic
punch
isnt
a
bad
repercussion
either
so
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
great
brew
possibly
the
best
american
pale
ale
there
is
i
cant
help
but
to
feel
patriotic
when
i
enjoy
this
craft
classic
i
would
join
a
local
militia
and
defend
this
country
solely
for
its
heroic
efforts
devoted
when
brewing
this
precedent
for
american
pale
ales
light
on
the
malt
perfectly
overflexed
with
hop
bitterness
this
beer
boasts
balance
touch
of
dessert
bread
met
by
clean
citrus
bitterness
pure
perfection
when
following
the
criteria
for
what
an
american
pale
should
be
i
would
present
this
hop
cake
at
any
close
friends
birthday
definitely
a
recomendation
for
any
beer
drinker
making
the
transition
from
tastless
massproduced
heartless
garbage
drinker
to
craft
brew
enthusiast
america
once
again
a
shining
beacon
of
light
in
the
world
of
beer
at
best
this
is
a
beautifal
song
to
the
hop
i
cracked
the
top
and
the
hops
jumped
from
the
bottel
to
my
nose
i
poured
into
a
glass
and
was
happy
to
see
the
purfict
hue
for
a
pale
ther
was
a
great
start
to
the
beer
kind
of
sweet
and
lightley
carobanated
then
the
hops
overpower
the
grain
thay
hit
hard
and
after
you
swallo
the
bitterness
fades
to
a
fregrant
spring
day
flavor
start
to
finish
the
purfict
after
work
take
into
the
shower
with
you
beer
overall
a
well
rounded
pale
ale
to
be
honest
i
expected
a
more
powerful
west
coast
hop
presence
but
theyve
saved
that
craft
for
other
brews
i
believe
this
to
be
an
excellent
introductory
beer
to
those
just
learning
to
appreciate
hops
nice
apa
not
overly
hoppy
balanced
with
taste
of
some
pine
some
citrus
flavor
is
not
overpowering
like
some
in
this
class
cascade
hops
add
some
distinction
to
the
taste
am
waiting
to
go
to
my
local
watering
hole
to
try
this
on
tap
as
they
just
started
serving
this
beer
overall
very
drinkable
indeed
just
a
great
classic
pale
ale
if
there
werent
so
many
thousands
of
other
beers
to
try
i
would
be
picking
these
up
all
the
freaking
time
drinkability
is
outstanding
i
often
find
myself
drinking
more
sierra
nevadas
just
so
that
i
can
go
out
and
buy
more
sierra
nevadas
all
in
all
a
very
good
apa
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
a
classic
american
pale
ale
it
may
not
be
the
best
pale
ale
in
america
but
its
still
very
good
and
it
stands
as
a
benchmark
to
the
american
pale
ale
style
the
citrus
hop
profile
and
the
malty
backbone
make
this
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
i
just
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
hop
flavor
as
opposed
to
the
bottled
beer
absolutly
no
harshness
to
the
hops
at
all
the
caramel
malts
were
well
balanced
to
the
hops
very
very
good
beer
when
served
draft
highly
recommended
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
when
we
stopped
into
tcs
lounge
late
night
this
past
friday
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
large
white
head
forming
pumpkin
orange
color
smell
was
a
bit
tingly
with
lots
of
hops
present
taste
is
awesome
as
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
pale
ale
hoppy
smooth
crisp
with
a
bite
you
cant
go
wrong
if
this
is
all
they
have
for
decent
beer
youll
find
this
stuff
everywhere
its
a
treat
or
its
a
last
resort
oddly
enough
even
dive
bars
carry
it
that
said
its
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
so
i
never
really
order
more
that
one
of
these
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
a
yardstick
in
the
craft
beer
world
with
good
reason
d
very
drinkable
session
beer
taste
and
smell
dont
blow
me
out
of
the
water
so
im
ranking
this
lower
than
if
they
were
really
exciting
solid
yellow
in
color
with
white
head
it
smells
moderately
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
spice
tastes
moderately
of
hops
and
citrus
a
teeny
bit
of
malt
and
has
a
strong
amount
of
carbonation
just
a
damn
solid
american
pale
ale
that
i
tend
to
take
for
granted
until
i
find
myself
in
a
jam
and
i
learn
to
appreciate
it
all
over
again
although
heavy
on
the
hops
and
citrus
this
beer
is
quite
simply
excellent
for
many
different
foods
climates
and
occasions
and
quite
possibly
is
the
reference
beer
for
the
american
pale
ale
style
love
it
drinkability
one
of
those
perfect
chillout
highly
drinkable
beers
nothing
you
have
to
think
about
but
with
plenty
of
taste
and
substance
t
smooth
medium
bodied
malty
biscuit
body
with
a
earthy
flavor
grain
and
floral
hops
citrus
rind
finish
amazingly
refreshing
and
drinkable
nice
clean
sharp
hop
bitterness
at
first
then
a
malt
smoothness
takes
over
and
then
it
goes
dry
and
sharp
hop
bitterness
for
the
finish
an
exceptional
apa
in
fact
i
think
it
to
be
the
quintesential
apa
in
every
respect
for
a
bigquasiregionalsemicraft
brewery
i
love
the
consisitance
in
the
quality
fair
pricingvalue
and
good
flavors
i
think
this
is
a
benchmark
beer
when
i
think
apa
i
think
sierra

pale
ale
there
may
be
some
better
out
there
but
not
many
and
never
as

this
is

color
with
an
off
white
head
light
sweet
citrusy
smell
with
pine
in
the
background
slightly
hoppy
balance
taste
with
the
smells
in
the
background
some
orange
taste
nice
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
renowned
for
its
quality
and
rightly
so
of
beers
recognized
by
non
beer
people
it
is
the
best
this
is
one
of
my
regular
brews
along
with
sweetgrass
so
maybe
i
under
rate
it
its
a
great
ale
i
like
it
because
its
somewhat
hoppypiney
buy
some
and
drink
it
great
pour
the
thing
that
i
like
the
best
about
this
particular
brew
is
that
its
a
good
drink
but
available
nearly
everywhere
out
here
i
got
this
one
at
hooligans
in
pocatello
idaho
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
out
there
nice
flavor
and
nice
balanced
complexity
this
is
a
great
beer
for
any
type
of
drinker
and
does
not
disappoint
highly
recommended
this
is
the
staple
of
the
frisbee
cricut
always
availabe
once
i
showed
up
to
a
tournament
this
weekend
my
friend
had
one
right
away
for
me
i
would
always
take
a
6
pack
of
sierra
nevada
when
i
would
go
on
the
road
to
a
tournament
anyways
the
look
of
the
beer
has
a
dark
amber
color
little
foam
that
disappears
quickly
smells
of
hops
and
some
fruit
good
smell
overall
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
and
fruity
excellent
taste
the
feel
is
smooth
with
carbonation
good
wetness
the
drinkability
is
very
good
with
an
extra
sweetness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
snappy
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
not
to
heavy
in
the
stomach
i
can
and
have
drunk
way
to
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
very
easy
drinker
an
exceptional
world
classic
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
but
still
smooth
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
a
very
refreshing
pale
ale
very
smooth
light
refreshing
medium
bodied
with
an
exceptionally
drinkability
one
the
quintessential
american
style
pale
ales
and
a
wonderful
beer
quaffing
beer
that
reminds
you
of
when
you
first
discovered
good
beer
could
be
had
this
beer
reminds
me
of
some
other
brewers
ipas
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
really
nicely
balanced
and
very
refreshing
folks
from
the
states
come
to
australia
and
often
compare
little
creatures
pale
ale
to
snpa
and
im
glad
i
can
now
do
the
same
it
would
be
great
to
drink
snpa
all
the
time
but
i
dont
think
im
really
missing
out
given
i
have
critters
here
in
australia
to
fill
the
gap
i
think
this
beer
has
it
all
taste
drinkability
and
its
affordable
a
perennial
favorite
id
prefer
more
malt
balance
this
brews
one
note
short
of
a
chord
a
little
more
hoptomalt
harmony
and
id
be
dancing
d
one
of
my
favorite
beers
goes
down
so
well
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
well
gotta
say
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
guy
definitely
the
one
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
and
still
a
win
over
most
of
the
stuff
out
there
pours
a
delicious
deep
amber
color
with
a
colossal
head
that
leaves
outstanding
lacing
seriously
this
beer
looks
amazing
nose
is
solid
maltier
than
i
remembered
but
lots
of
swirling
citrus
and
light
floral
hops
as
well
taste
is
likewise
strong
and
delicious
lots
of
caramel
malt
balanced
nicely
with
the
mildly
spicy
grapefruit
hops
feel
is
good
medium
body
with
solid
carbonation
really
an
excellent
beer
might
have
to
switch
to
these
more
often
if
prices
keep
going
up
like
they
are
d
i
cant
stop
give
me
a
case
a
light
hoppy
aroma
with
notable
floral
and
citrus
segues
to
a
great
taste
and
a
very
pleasant
finish
this
is
one
of
the
most
consistent
brews
ive
experienced
be
it
in
the
bottle
or
on
tap
no
more
twistoffs
though
as
they
went
to
pry
off
tops
a
year
or
so
back
so
dont
forget
the
opener
light
orange
appearance
with
a
white
head
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
flowery
hops
citrus
and
yeast
taste
is
bitter
at
first
then
rather
sweet
and
again
citrusymuch
like
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
crisp
rather
carbonated
at
first
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
ive
been
drinking
it
for
years
and
its
consistently
great
this
is
just
about
the
best
apa
out
there
in
my
estimation
drinkability
is
outstanding
two
or
three
or
these
is
a
great
night
along
with
bells
two
hearted
this
beer
defines
the
gold
standard
for
pale
ales
d
despite
its
strong
floral
hops
and
relatively
high
bitterness
its
a
great
beer
anytime
and
thankfully
available
nearly
everywhere
a
goto
beer
anytime
taste
is
perhaps
a
little
insipid
but
with
lots
of
bitterness
aftertaste
is
very
smooth
bitter
and
the
mouthfheel
is
excellent
goes
down
very
easily
d
definitely
a
solid
session
beer
here
nice
hop
flavors
light
bodied
low
abv
easy
drinking
for
sure
d
great
session
beer
pairs
well
with
texmex
food
overall
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
but
i
still
prefer
little
creatures
pale
ale
have
had
this
numerous
times
and
i
was
at
a
bar
and
got
a
draft
and
had
a
pen
on
me
so
i
wrote
a
review
a
rich
copper
hue
with
a
onefinger
mountain
head
that
dies
so
slowly
leaving
a
lace
ring
down
the
entire
glass
a
hop
smell
is
prevelant
floral
and
citrus
with
some
malts
in
there
and
a
light
alcohol
smell
fullbodied
and
creamy
delicious
with
a
coffeebread
malt
taste
on
the
back
blended
with
some
hops
for
a
semidry
backbite
has
a
citric
taste
going
down
before
the
like
orange
and
maybe
lemon
maybe
and
some
sweetness
in
it
like
theres
caramel
or
honey
in
it
a
quintessential
microbrew
to
be
enjoyed
by
everyone
pours
up
good
looking
golden
brown
nice
white
head
definite
hop
spicyness
in
the
nose
also
some
subtle
malt
theres
a
little
bit
of
citrusy
hop
smell
too
also
taste
of
hop
bitterness
for
sure
pretty
light
bodied
medium
carbo
easy
drinking
great
session
pale
d
easy
drinking
brew
now
if
i
can
just
find
lagunitas
ipa
down
here
ill
be
such
a
happy
camper
d
this
beer
drank
pretty
good
dont
it
its
refreshing
wellbalanced
and
lightthis
is
a
great
session
apa
its
got
a
nice
balance
of
hop
bitternesstang
with
malt
sweetness
and
is
a
safe
choice
i
could
definitely
kick
a
few
of
these
back
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
to
finish
the
beer
is
highly
refreshing
and
has
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
would
pair
nicely
with
a
sweet
dessert
my
personal
favorite
pairing
is
new
york
style
cheesecake
dvery
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
them
on
a
regular
basis
d
this
is
very
drinkable
but
on
a
happy
stomach
this
could
cause
problems
if
you
havent
eaten
drinkability
hops
are
a
bit
much
for
a
session
beer
but
two
will
do
you
just
fine
throwing
horseshoes
over
at
my
neighbors
i
was
able
to
sample
three
beers
one
right
after
the
other
good
opportunity
for
comparison
as
horseshoes
is
always
a
multiple
beer
event
anyway
the
three
included
my
old
stand
by
sweetwater
420
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
and
sweetwater
ipa
in
my
estimation
the
sweetwater
ipa
was
the
far
superior
of
the
three
better
flavor
and
drinkability
i
was
struck
by
how
similar
the
420
and
the
sierra
nevada
tasted
however
i
think
i
would
slightly
give
the
nod
to
the
sierra
nevada
its
taste
is
better
than
average
with
hoppiness
and
sweet
malt
balanced
some
cloying
straw
taste
that
is
also
in
the
420
but
not
so
much
interesting
that
before
i
started
sampling
widely
from
other
beers
recently
i
didnt
notice
the
straw
flavor
in
420
it
was
my
favorite
beer
now
i
would
be
pretty
loathe
to
go
back
to
it
luckily
sweetwaters
ipa
is
so
good
that
i
can
still
give
my
business
to
that
local
brewery
highly
recommended
i
could
sit
here
and
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
gold
color
mediumsize
white
head
little
bit
of
lacing
mostly
malt
aroma
a
little
bit
of
citrus
the
citrus
comes
through
more
in
the
taste
and
i
think
it
intensifies
in
your
mouth
a
little
bit
of
malt
in
the
taste
also
classic
apa
i
remember
this
being
the
first
true
real
beer
ever
tasting
appearence
is
golden
copper
with
champange
like
carbonation
rising
to
a
thin
bubbley
head
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
grapefruit
with
grass
malt
like
undertones
alchole
soaked
all
wheat
bread
is
present
as
well
taste
is
crisp
dry
citrus
flowers
grapefruit
and
bready
great
beer
will
never
pass
it
up
d
drinks
good
but
the
grapefruit
is
too
much
for
me
to
pound
this
beer
down
md
a
rather
light
and
dry
brew
carbonation
is
fine
but
brisk
and
the
brew
has
a
smooth
disposition
a
fantastic
beverage
but
i
might
have
considered
it
an
ipa
especially
if
you
like
hops
grab
one
of
these
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
a
great
beer
to
have
with
burgers
and
steaks
this
is
my
goto
when
available
and
there
is
nothing
new
for
me
to
try
readily
available
in
most
of
my
local
grocery
stores
i
have
no
good
excuse
not
to
keep
this
fine
brew
in
my
fridge
though
my
rating
scale
might
not
specifically
reflect
my
love
for
this
beer
i
have
to
say
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
kind
of
pricey
depending
where
youre
at
but
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
youre
into
pale
ales
pick
it
up
you
will
not
be
disappointed
the
aroma
is
mostly
hop
which
is
reflected
in
the
flavor
as
well
astringent
and
dry
with
a
below
average
body
highly
carbonated
good
aftertaste
of
strong
hop
bitterness
d
this
is
one
of
those
classic
beers
that
cant
be
duplicated
and
will
forever
mesmerize
drinkers
because
of
its
great
nature
and
pleasing
taste
d
quite
drinkable
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
weak
but
it
is
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
excellent
hop
character
especially
in
the
aroma
this
beer
is
so
much
fucking
better
out
of
the
bottle
the
fruity
flavours
come
out
where
the
co2
hinders
it
out
of
the
tap
the
mouth
on
this
is
one
of
hoppy
goodness
the
backend
is
a
bit
bitter
but
not
overdone
i
hear
the
fresh
pale
ale
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
is
phenomenal
this
will
be
my
goto
beer
for
quite
some
time
i
imagine
this
beer
was
the
one
that
opened
the
door
to
the
craft
brewing
scene
for
me
being
an
irishman
i
was
raised
on
certain
beers
and
this
opened
my
eyes
and
i
still
go
back
to
it
every
now
and
again
in
the
heat
of
summer
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
as
much
as
ill
get
crucified
for
suggesting
it
an
ex
girlfriend
of
mine
used
to
love
it
with
a
lemon
wedge
and
it
adds
a
great
extra
level
of
refreshment
drinkability
a
classic
pale
ale
very
drinkable
nothing
to
complain
about
here
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
probably
the
most
solid
of
the
mainstream
offerings
you
can
get
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
and
i
frequently
pick
this
stuff
up
ok
i
drink
this
beer
more
than
i
drink
any
other
so
yeah
i
could
be
considered
a
fan
but
whatever
this
beer
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
to
me
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
solidarity
in
a
pale
ale
pours
a
light
amber
smell
is
citrus
and
floral
with
pine
man
does
this
beer
taste
good
its
perfect
for
a
pale
ale
the
taste
is
a
sweetbut
not
too
sweet
malt
but
then
the
hops
have
their
say
awesome
hop
bitter
the
lacing
is
awesome
its
like
drooping
rings
abv
is
5
6
so
its
easy
to
slam
a
6
pack
pretty
much
perfect
for
a
pale
ale
on
drinkability
i
mean
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
and
its
really
easy
to
find
they
did
some
serious
work
on
this
recipe
an
extremely
awesome
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
if
you
dont
like
this
pale
ale
then
you
just
dont
like
pale
ale
i
like
it
with
extra
sharp
cheddar
cheese
overall
if
i
had
to
choose
3
beers
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
could
very
well
be
one
of
them
flavor
is
dry
and
bitter
its
sporting
some
citrus
mild
spice
and
has
decent
medium
malt
body
dominant
hopbitter
rather
than
sweet
its
not
a
thick
chewy
beer
but
there
is
plenty
of
meat
to
separate
it
from
imposters
theres
a
little
grain
on
the
finish
aftertaste
is
grainy
dry
and
pleasant
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
pours
a
clear
ambery
orange
with
nice
white
frothy
head
smell
is
west
coast
hoppage
with
some
spice
taste
is
quite
good
with
wonderful
west
coast
hoppiness
i
have
some
sorry
ass
ipas
alaskan
with
less
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
than
snpa
some
good
spice
in
the
taste
as
well
certainly
a
staple
pale
ale
round
these
parts
and
imo
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
this
is
always
a
go
to
when
you
have
to
run
in
and
run
out
of
the
store
great
beer
had
never
had
anything
from
sierra
nevada
before
although
ive
seen
it
often
this
great
pale
makes
me
want
to
definitely
check
out
some
of
their
other
styles
notes
this
is
my
default
beer
if
i
find
it
on
tap
and
the
other
choices
are
not
satisfactory
it
is
very
consistent
and
interesting
moderate
mouth
feel
and
bready
maltiness
taste
adding
balance
and
enjoyment
in
the
glass
it
is
a
very
pretty
clear
goldencopper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
bright
and
floral
with
hops
some
citrus
in
there
too
with
a
bit
of
caramel
underneath
the
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
caramel
up
with
and
them
the
grapefruity
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
shows
up
and
is
fantastic
there
are
also
some
bready
flavors
in
there
and
while
the
beer
warmed
up
i
think
i
tasted
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
underneath
there
is
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
never
get
between
me
and
a
snpa
do
you
hear
me
never
mouthfeeldrinkability
well
carbonated
but
slick
and
smooth
enough
to
really
enjoy
the
texture
complements
the
bright
hops
and
subtle
malts
letting
the
flavors
emerge
fully
one
of
the
most
accessible
yet
thoroughly
satisfying
beers
with
that
beautiful
west
coast
hop
kick
a
great
offering
this
was
one
of
the
first
craft
brews
i
ever
had
i
remember
thinking
how
strong
it
was
at
the
time
lets
see
how
it
treats
me
now
pours
a
clear
copper
with
an
off
white
twofinger
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
smells
of
hops
with
a
tinge
of
citrus
and
pine
in
the
background
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
i
remember
which
is
not
surprising
in
fact
its
not
strong
at
all
but
very
drinkable
the
citrusy
hops
are
mellowed
out
with
the
malts
and
a
bit
of
biscuity
goodness
theres
a
fruity
essence
apparent
as
well
and
a
subtle
sweetness
comes
forth
after
a
while
very
smooth
with
not
much
carbonation
going
on
great
balance
of
taste
and
drinkability
theres
a
reason
this
one
is
so
popular
d
a
great
pale
and
a
great
session
beer
nothing
betther
than
having
a
case
of
this
stuff
while
you
are
tending
to
the
bbq
you
can
easily
drink
quite
a
few
so
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
this
all
day
long
love
it
the
original
i
dont
think
i
appreciate
the
hop
character
and
bitterness
as
much
as
i
used
to
when
i
was
just
a
virgin
but
for
some
reason
this
is
not
as
distinctive
as
it
used
to
be
but
still
a
very
good
brew
like
classic
rock
you
can
do
it
over
and
over
again
and
it
is
still
great
incredibly
smooth
with
low
carbonation
almost
creamy
its
a
fantastic
drinking
beer
and
could
easily
become
a
great
session
beer
here
in
oz
if
the
price
was
a
bit
cheaper
what
else
can
one
say
but
almost
true
perfection
not
too
much
carbonation
excellent
aroma
color
threw
me
off
at
first
but
love
is
blind
the
citrusy
notes
finishes
clean
off
the
palate
beer
not
quite
the
same
in
the
bottle
i
would
strongly
urge
everyone
to
try
this
at
least
once
or
twice
oh
why
stop
there
comes
in
kegs
too
d
excellent
example
of
a
pale
ale
poured
a
slightly
darker
amber
color
had
a
perfect
head
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
great
with
a
lot
of
hops
and
citrus
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hops
but
i
have
been
on
quite
an
ipa
binge
recently
so
maybe
i
was
affected
by
this
that
said
the
general
taste
was
pleasant
and
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
pale
ale
it
poured
a
brownishorange
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
descent
lacing
down
the
glass
its
nose
was
full
of
esters
a
flowery
citrus
scent
with
grassy
undertones
its
taste
was
mild
which
made
for
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
taste
is
much
like
its
nose
primarily
floral
up
front
with
some
spicy
and
citrus
flavors
in
back
hops
were
definitely
present
but
not
overpowering
very
crisp
and
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
this
beer
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
smells
of
hops
and
standard
grains
a
familiar
flavor
the
hops
come
to
the
forefront
of
this
really
balanced
beer
has
a
sweet
finish
this
was
one
of
my
first
micros
early
90s
when
i
found
guinness
first
introduction
to
hops
definately
gets
a
bump
in
review
from
nostalgia
a
highly
drinkable
beer
d
this
was
my
standby
beer
for
at
least
a
couple
years
running
but
its
been
a
year
or
so
since
ive
had
it
and
i
remember
why
i
liked
it
just
an
excellent
american
pale
ale
definitely
recommend
it
overall
an
absolute
staple
in
my
fridge
beer
the
way
beer
should
be
easy
and
flavorful
highly
recommended
d
not
too
shabby
i
think
with
a
bit
less
carbonation
the
smoothness
would
temp
me
to
quaff
down
a
couple
more
of
these
things
i
have
really
enjoyed
the
sn
pale
ale
for
a
while
now
and
have
finally
had
the
chance
to
rate
it
nice
job
a
great
beer
to
try
and
clone
as
far
as
homebrewing
goes
the
color
of
this
brew
is
a
beautiful
merger
of
gold
and
orange
the
exuded
scents
are
an
aromatic
bouquet
of
floral
hops
lime
orange
and
pine
needles
carbonated
and
nimble
on
the
palate
the
presence
of
hops
is
noticeable
throughout
a
slight
sweet
and
bready
character
provides
a
nice
balance
to
the
hops
the
beer
finishes
with
dry
bitterness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pleasing
and
enjoyable
beer
one
for
any
occasion
nice
fluffy
white
head
is
strong
and
laces
very
nicely
pours
golden
yeasty
odor
but
the
hops
are
present
very
mild
and
no
bitterness
fruity
very
dry
beer
not
a
complicated
taste
at
all
basic
but
boring
goes
easy
and
has
a
malty
aftertaste
recommended
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
want
that
pale
ale
taste
without
the
extra
hops
of
an
ipa
beautiful
amberred
color
and
nice
thick
white
head
impressive
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
my
favorite
characteristic
drinkable
not
a
bad
standby
apa
mfd
clean
and
refreshing
taste
lots
of
bubbles
and
pleanty
of
dry
flavor
a
classic
american
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
out
there
if
you
havent
tried
this
classic
get
out
there
and
find
one
this
is
a
good
beer
if
pale
ale
is
your
thing
it
has
a
heck
of
a
white
foamy
head
on
top
of
a
knox
blocks
colored
liquid
it
smells
heavily
of
hops
its
taste
is
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
feel
is
a
bit
oily
and
a
medium
bodied
beer
im
not
big
on
pale
ales
but
this
isnt
bad
and
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
the
classic
american
pale
ale
and
i
respect
it
and
dig
it
a
pleasure
to
consume
anytime
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
with
appropriate
levels
of
carbonation
just
as
it
should
be
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
and
have
just
sat
around
and
drank
this
all
day
and
night
this
is
a
classic
staple
of
this
style
of
beer
and
ill
always
be
coming
back
to
it
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
it
may
be
my
new
lawnmower
beer
this
summer
d
this
guy
was
very
drinkable
and
i
would
love
to
get
this
guy
again
d
fantastic
with
a
nice
steak
or
pasta
dinner
easily
could
be
a
daily
favorite
this
one
is
easily
consumed
and
is
nice
and
crisp
i
drank
it
on
its
own
but
will
try
again
with
mexican
food
maybe
highly
recommended
for
the
style
drinkability
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
drink
one
after
the
other
d
this
may
be
the
epitome
of
the
apa
and
is
a
great
example
for
the
style
i
poured
one
12
fl
oz
bottle
into
my
trusty
tasting
snifter
and
almost
immediately
smelled
the
aroma
of
hops
this
is
definitely
a
more
aggressively
hopped
a
p
a
there
was
a
short
head
only
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
which
eventually
subsided
the
color
was
a
beautiful
amber
gold
as
mentioned
before
the
nose
was
sharp
with
hops
and
also
a
yeasty
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
bold
for
an
american
pale
ale
you
can
tell
that
the
good
brewers
at
sierra
nevada
take
their
time
crafting
this
offering
ill
have
to
remember
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
next
time
im
out
at
the
beer
distributor
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
its
been
around
for
a
good
while
and
ive
enjoyed
it
for
a
long
time
but
not
untill
recently
have
i
actually
savored
every
aspect
of
beer
ive
just
recently
started
tasting
beer
for
what
it
really
is
delicious
id
rank
sierra
nevada
as
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
for
the
casual
drinker
anyone
whom
enjoys
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
a
slight
bitebitterness
will
enjoy
this
beer
it
delivers
a
nice
pour
with
a
head
that
dissipates
to
generous
lacing
golden
brown
in
apperance
with
an
aroma
of
floral
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
pine
and
finishes
clean
ordering
a
second
of
these
to
wash
down
a
lousy
fish
sandwich
for
lunch
today
was
not
only
necessary
but
quite
enjoyable
far
from
the
boldest
pale
ale
but
solid
and
quite
tasty
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
think
it
is
perfect
for
the
style
i
always
try
and
keep
a
few
of
these
around
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
tend
to
go
a
little
slower
on
hoppy
styles
of
beer
but
this
one
had
me
reaching
for
another
this
ale
has
good
drinkability
and
could
go
well
with
seafood
or
other
light
tasting
dishes
aroma
is
moderate
pine
hops
with
light
molasses
malts
pour
yields
a
small
frothy
barely
offwhite
head
with
fair
lacing
the
color
is
a
golden
honey
taste
is
fruity
at
first
followed
by
moderate
bitterness
not
watery
at
all
light
to
medium
body
slightly
over
carbonated
quite
possibly
the
king
of
common
beers
overall
very
solid
this
is
a
very
good
flagship
beer
for
sierra
nevada
and
i
should
try
more
of
their
offerings
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
celebration
ale
overall
a
crisp
and
hoppy
pale
ale
good
hop
mix
for
aroma
complex
and
intriguing
it
draws
you
into
a
sip
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
a
well
crafted
ale
drinkability
is
superb
this
is
a
definite
go
to
beer
for
me
and
its
good
that
perhaps
the
most
easilyavailable
american
pale
ale
is
such
a
classic
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
and
a
good
dinner
party
beer
cheers
dvery
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
great
beer
that
is
very
well
balanced
also
hops
isnt
too
strong
so
most
of
my
friends
will
drink
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
hops
and
malt
the
taste
was
the
samewith
a
bitter
after
taste
overall
this
beer
met
my
expectations
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
beer
on
draft
at
ufc
73
in
sacramento
lovely
amberish
color
with
just
a
little
white
head
smell
is
a
great
fruity
fresh
hoppy
scent
taste
is
medium
hoppy
up
front
followed
by
a
malty
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
very
nice
finish
great
beer
overall
with
lots
of
flavor
and
a
nice
finish
and
much
better
than
i
expected
i
really
liked
this
one
mouthfeel
drinkability
excellent
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
no
tart
or
sour
aftertaste
i
always
try
to
have
at
least
a
sixer
of
these
in
the
fridge
at
a
time
oveall
this
is
a
great
beer
one
i
consider
the
measuring
stick
for
american
pale
ales
highly
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
one
of
those
beers
where
after
you
have
had
two
you
just
have
to
finish
the
whole
six
pack
as
many
have
already
said
its
a
benchmark
for
the
apa
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
apa
or
ipa
people
who
do
not
like
massive
doses
of
hop
goodness
should
beware
but
you
probably
knew
that
already
pours
a
really
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
has
some
average
lacing
smell
is
good
hoppy
with
a
nice
malty
undertoe
taste
is
good
has
a
stronger
alcohol
flavor
than
one
would
expect
the
hop
flavor
is
piney
and
citrusy
aftertaste
is
kinda
malty
good
beer
all
around
i
really
like
this
beer
its
been
my
standard
for
several
years
now
my
wife
also
loves
it
its
one
of
the
few
bottled
beers
that
really
retain
its
hop
flavor
and
aroma
and
if
thats
not
enough
i
can
get
it
at
my
local
target
for
11
99
12
pack
its
cheaper
than
most
of
the
crap
beers
they
sell
go
figure
i
havent
had
a
sierra
nevada
brew
in
a
while
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
w
a
decent
head
which
dissipated
a
bit
quick
leaving
a
decent
lacing
in
my
pint
glass
a
hoppy
smell
mostly
a
piney
citrus
w
some
malt
and
slight
fruitiness
in
the
nose
a
nice
crisp
hop
flavor
initially
with
some
bready
malts
in
the
mix
great
malthop
balance
a
light
semidry
mouthfeel
w
a
decent
amount
of
co2
lets
the
flavor
stay
around
just
long
enough
an
excellent
beer
in
fact
i
think
it
was
the
original
apa
and
set
the
style
example
and
at
5
6
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
drinkability
if
you
have
too
many
of
these
it
sits
like
a
rock
in
your
digestive
tract
however
its
dry
profile
lets
it
go
well
with
many
foods
and
its
always
fun
to
enjoy
one
or
two
during
a
ballgame
hopheads
can
mellow
a
bit
with
this
sturdy
but
never
overbearing
ale
while
some
may
just
relish
the
bitterness
they
rarely
get
with
other
shoddily
crafted
pales
sierra
nevada
and
dogfish
head
really
turned
me
on
to
hops
but
you
just
dont
see
dfh
ontap
too
many
places
around
here
thank
goodness
for
sierra
nevada
had
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
deep
copper
color
with
slight
cloudiness
and
nice
one
finger
head
smells
of
slight
hop
presence
but
soft
first
sip
is
smooth
decent
hop
presence
but
balanced
well
with
the
malts
i
would
say
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
nothing
overdone
more
kick
than
most
pale
ales
though
good
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
had
a
good
feel
like
some
people
say
good
with
food
as
its
pretty
damn
crisp
but
it
leaves
me
with
too
much
of
a
fruit
peel
aftertaste
to
enjoy
reminds
me
a
lot
of
gin
in
that
way
finished
a
bit
harsh
too
d
more
please
cold
warm
out
of
the
glassware
or
out
of
the
bottle
i
like
this
one
a
lot
d
very
drinkable
and
compliments
a
meal
very
nicely
perhaps
not
completely
sessionable
but
its
tempting
d
definitely
a
winner
this
is
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
micro
brewing
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
goes
well
with
most
foods
and
is
one
of
my
standard
everyday
beers
might
be
a
bit
more
bitter
than
batches
ive
had
in
the
past
still
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
my
favorite
pale
ale
at
this
time
if
i
were
only
allowed
one
beer
for
all
time
i
guess
this
would
be
it
for
an
everyday
craft
beer
it
is
at
the
top
of
the
pedestal
of
apas
drinkability
once
i
conquered
my
fears
of
cascade
hops
it
became
a
standard
though
i
still
prefer
stones
only
just
this
beer
makes
me
feel
nostalgic
it
was
one
of
the
two
or
three
brews
that
really
got
me
hooked
on
better
beer
i
remember
back
then
being
impressed
by
the
hoppiness
of
it
but
now
after
being
exposed
to
a
whole
new
world
of
beers
i
am
struck
by
the
balance
in
the
ingredients
it
is
a
supremely
drinkable
classic
of
an
american
craft
beer
if
sierra
nevada
would
only
put
some
kind
of
freshness
dating
on
their
bottles
i
would
keep
this
one
around
much
more
often
pours
out
with
a
golden
brown
hue
some
head
not
a
hard
pour
and
pretty
continuous
bubbling
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
pine
and
hops
its
somewhat
floral
too
with
a
slight
fruity
sweetness
the
taste
starts
bitter
and
ends
bitter
with
a
little
sweetness
in
between
after
a
while
it
makes
me
think
of
apples
a
little
bit
it
feels
fresh
and
clean
with
a
mild
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
nothing
offensive
in
the
end
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
although
every
time
ive
had
it
ive
never
been
as
excited
as
some
be
are
about
it
im
not
yearning
for
more
when
im
done
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
yet
encountered
that
actually
has
a
really
great
taste
with
the
abv
toward
the
lower
end
and
the
excellent
representation
of
an
american
pale
ale
this
is
one
to
grab
for
longer
sessions
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
bronze
color
with
a
ton
of
yeast
floaters
decent
carb
no
lacing
it
had
a
small
beige
head
that
settled
into
a
partial
film
the
aroma
was
floral
and
hoppy
with
a
grassy
malt
smell
as
well
something
in
there
didnt
sit
right
though
it
also
appeared
in
the
taste
it
was
a
weird
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
usually
dont
find
in
paipas
i
love
a
good
bitter
paipa
bite
but
that
weird
aftertaste
really
hurt
this
one
i
got
as
a
single
so
possible
that
its
a
bad
sample
so
will
try
again
but
for
now
i
cant
really
recommend
one
and
done
d
one
of
the
great
pale
ales
a
true
american
craft
ale
a
classic
apa
a
brilliant
goldenamber
hue
flows
from
the
bottle
to
create
a
snappy
fingers
width
head
that
fizzles
out
a
bit
quick
not
much
lacing
or
stickage
either
wafts
of
clean
malt
hang
out
behind
a
citrusy
and
slightly
piny
hop
aroma
clean
hop
bitterness
with
a
slight
sweetness
are
followed
up
by
a
dry
finish
a
well
balanced
session
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
has
a
little
too
much
co2
and
pops
without
much
of
a
creamy
or
lucious
texture
id
been
worried
for
sometime
that
sierra
nevada
was
becoming
to
mainstream
but
it
appears
that
even
though
more
mass
markets
are
carrying
their
beer
they
are
still
able
to
produce
a
quality
product
i
liked
this
one
of
course
beer
always
tastes
better
when
you
finish
skiing
i
did
have
this
beer
with
rocklette
when
i
was
in
utah
it
happens
to
be
my
3rd
favorite
beer
behind
the
heffe
and
the
bass
that
i
drank
but
i
always
have
enjoyed
sn
beers
in
the
past
so
i
could
not
go
wrong
d
not
much
new
to
say
about
this
one
an
american
brew
classic
and
probably
the
most
popular
micro
in
the
country
also
a
good
option
for
a
beer
on
draft
since
its
widely
available
on
tap
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
tastes
pretty
good
it
is
available
pretty
much
everywhere
which
is
great
because
i
will
reach
for
this
over
any
bmc
any
day
it
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
it
is
also
one
of
the
quintessential
training
wheel
beers
for
most
people
that
i
know
dgood
i
could
have
several
at
which
point
i
wold
have
to
switch
to
something
with
more
hops
poured
orange
amber
with
a
half
inch
head
decent
lacing
and
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
aroma
was
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
just
right
for
a
pale
ale
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
with
a
clean
dry
finish
good
mouthfeel
carbonation
was
bright
and
sparkling
very
drinkable
a
good
pairing
with
bar
food
overall
i
think
this
beer
company
gets
way
too
much
attention
for
something
that
doesnt
taste
very
good
by
beer
standards
another
great
classic
brew
from
a
company
that
ive
really
taken
a
liking
too
a
copper
colored
beer
poured
with
an
impressive
head
that
receded
after
a
bit
smell
is
very
dry
and
biscuity
the
taste
is
solid
a
good
example
of
the
style
with
caramel
and
bready
overtones
mouthfeel
is
equally
good
and
with
an
easy
drinkability
this
is
a
classic
american
brew
their
celebration
ale
was
great
and
this
somewhat
reminds
me
of
it
with
a
lower
alcohol
percentage
a
good
clean
crisp
taste
definitely
recommended
a
little
high
in
the
abv
department
but
i
have
no
trouble
drinking
6
of
these
d
very
high
definitely
one
to
always
have
in
the
fridge
alongside
the
others
the
first
thing
you
get
when
opening
a
bottle
of
sn
pale
ale
is
a
huge
dose
of
cirtusy
hoppy
goodness
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
has
a
nice
pale
amber
color
with
a
small
whiteish
head
again
the
smell
is
dominated
by
citrus
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
strong
hop
dominance
but
a
nice
malt
backbone
moth
feel
is
slightly
watery
very
drinkable
all
in
all
it
is
a
great
beer
that
you
can
find
almost
anywhere
in
my
experience
drinkability
a
nice
dinner
or
stay
home
and
chill
beer
d
sessionable
as
anything
really
not
anything
somebody
can
say
bad
about
sierra
nevada
pale
i
really
dont
buy
it
much
anymore
unless
i
am
at
a
gas
station
and
this
is
the
only
micro
they
have
but
writing
a
review
makes
me
think
about
just
how
quintessential
this
brew
is
a
classic
if
there
ever
was
one
drinkability
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
thats
readily
available
and
generally
easy
on
the
wallet
drinkability
classic
american
ale
great
session
choice
very
refreshing
and
goes
with
everything
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
seeing
that
it
is
one
of
my
faves
i
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
so
bottoms
up
d
this
is
one
of
my
standards
because
as
i
mentioned
its
so
easy
to
get
just
about
anywhere
a
great
summer
beer
because
its
light
and
not
too
dry
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
sure
beats
the
usual
restaurant
selection
d
this
one
is
more
hoppy
than
other
pale
ales
but
if
you
like
hops
this
is
a
good
beer
or
if
your
moving
into
ipas
nice
clear
pale
golden
brew
with
a
big
head
as
a
result
of
an
aggressive
pour
thin
head
remains
on
top
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
wonderful
smell
of
spicy
hops
and
malt
starts
out
strong
and
bitter
from
the
hops
and
then
smooths
out
with
some
maltiness
and
finishes
very
dry
and
hoppy
what
a
wonderful
brew
hard
to
say
american
pale
ale
and
not
think
of
this
beer
nice
crisp
hoppy
smell
taste
nice
and
bitter
but
with
a
woody
hint
very
drinkable
and
very
bubbly
the
whole
time
head
retention
is
not
the
best
legs
stream
long
for
awhile
though
taste
very
smooth
bitter
and
woody
eceptional
beer
would
be
able
to
drink
all
day
long
and
have
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
poured
from
a
bottle
its
orange
with
a
fingerwidth
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
as
you
drink
scent
is
surprisingly
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
thought
lots
of
fruit
and
a
woodygrassy
aroma
i
couldnt
place
palate
is
crisp
clean
and
very
dry
not
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
pales
and
ipas
you
get
a
slight
hop
burn
on
the
tongue
but
its
balanced
enough
to
let
the
grapefruit
and
spices
come
through
this
is
a
laid
back
pale
smooth
mild
and
highly
drinkable
different
and
good
light
and
dry
version
of
a
pale
ale
d
i
think
one
of
the
most
drinkable
readily
available
beers
on
the
market
as
of
right
now
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
as
is
the
carbonation
and
it
finishes
dry
and
has
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
for
some
time
still
one
of
my
favourites
of
the
style
and
one
i
frequent
often
it
is
that
good
a
good
beer
from
a
company
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
d
i
could
easily
drink
two
or
there
before
starting
to
feel
full
although
this
is
a
very
filling
beer
d
excellent
session
beer
that
has
a
perfect
balance
beer
after
beer
this
beer
is
positioned
between
a
lighter
hopped
pale
ale
and
a
hoppier
ipa
in
my
opinion
i
typically
shy
away
from
pale
ales
as
many
are
bland
and
not
hoppy
enough
this
is
an
exception
for
sure
dvery
drinkable
at
all
times
really
but
especially
when
out
a
eaterybarect
and
nothing
else
is
avaliblea
great
standby
a
classic
good
drinkability
with
a
shot
of
bitterness
i
recommend
this
beer
im
not
a
hop
head
by
any
means
whatsoever
but
i
found
this
drink
really
enjoyable
and
look
forward
to
my
next
encounter
hopefully
on
a
warm
day
just
after
ive
mowed
the
lawn
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
golden
white
head
that
doesnt
dissolve
too
quickly
very
smooth
a
good
ipa
rone
that
has
the
bitter
taste
that
usually
is
associated
with
the
ipa
without
leaving
a
bad
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
actually
a
little
bit
of
a
tart
taste
too
which
i
almost
want
to
say
is
a
hint
of
lemon
or
at
least
tastes
like
it
actually
has
a
lot
of
citrusy
undertones
in
general
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
especially
if
you
enjoy
ipas
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
with
all
the
great
characteristics
that
have
made
this
craft
beer
a
staple
of
good
beers
for
as
lons
as
it
has
been
around
this
is
one
excellent
pale
ale
a
very
nice
amber
pour
with
an
amber
colored
head
the
head
has
a
nice
thickness
that
goes
down
slowly
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
a
nice
american
pale
ale
the
aroma
is
really
nice
with
a
good
mesh
of
hops
and
malt
that
prove
to
make
a
nice
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
exceptional
nice
amount
of
hops
that
give
it
a
bitter
but
light
flavor
the
malt
is
blended
exceptionally
with
the
hops
and
a
nice
fruity
undetone
finishes
nice
and
clean
the
aftertaste
is
beautiful
and
the
carbonation
blends
the
whole
beer
very
well
very
drinkable
if
you
like
pale
ales
try
this
beer
very
good
overall
this
beer
is
the
reason
why
i
am
now
an
aspiring
beer
geek
it
made
me
crossover
from
the
massproduced
garbage
i
used
to
drink
so
much
in
college
now
as
i
try
a
multitude
of
other
great
craft
brews
this
beer
is
still
there
i
compare
it
to
the
original
3
episodes
of
star
wars
i
can
experience
it
over
and
over
again
and
never
be
let
down
in
the
end
it
will
always
bring
me
happiness
all
i
can
say
is
wow
ive
been
drinkin
many
different
beers
for
the
past
few
years
i
havnt
settled
on
one
yet
but
then
i
come
across
this
masterpiece
starting
with
the
first
popping
of
the
cap
the
smell
overwhelmes
my
senses
then
i
pour
slowly
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
an
offbalanced
orange
and
the
carbonation
going
straight
to
the
top
im
watching
as
im
typing
and
the
head
still
seems
to
be
growing
one
sip
two
sip
its
a
wonderful
brew
my
top
3
for
sure
one
ill
be
running
to
for
years
to
come
excellent
good
taste
color
smell
and
i
could
and
have
drank
these
all
day
long
i
liked
this
beer
when
i
first
started
exploring
more
exotic
beers
and
im
never
disappointed
when
i
return
to
it
the
price
availability
and
complexity
almost
perfumy
aspects
are
a
winwin
combination
and
help
to
explain
why
it
has
steadily
been
growing
in
marketshare
it
is
the
quintissential
citrucy
apa
that
all
must
be
compared
to
my
overall
favorite
every
day
beer
although
dales
is
starting
to
give
it
some
competition
overall
this
beer
dissapoints
in
most
categorys
although
if
i
had
to
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
finally
reviewing
after
several
tastings
both
in
bottle
and
on
tap
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
thick
almost
rocky
head
nice
smell
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
pine
taste
is
good
not
great
though
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
leaning
towards
the
hop
side
moderate
carbonation
leaves
a
crisp
and
light
feeling
in
the
mouth
with
a
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
and
has
a
good
flavor
do
to
the
hop
presence
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
an
amazing
one
due
to
its
availability
definitely
worth
drinking
over
most
other
beers
commonly
found
on
tap
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
thin
but
has
lots
of
flavor
when
a
place
has
very
few
taps
this
is
usually
the
best
they
have
to
offer
out
of
your
everyday
beers
of
high
quality
this
is
the
one
that
i
would
buy
most
often
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
west
coast
pale
example
well
worth
each
sip
this
went
great
w
my
roast
duckling
entree
this
is
my
go
to
brew
being
from
al
where
the
beer
selection
is
ass
i
can
usually
muster
up
a
six
pack
of
good
ole
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
almost
everywhere
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
from
its
amber
pour
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
to
its
crip
finish
this
beer
never
disappoints
i
am
reviewing
it
from
a
12oz
bottle
serving
but
i
will
say
that
it
is
even
more
glorious
on
draft
d
although
it
doesnt
pack
nearly
as
much
punch
as
i
had
expected
it
is
still
very
tasty
i
may
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
had
on
tap
at
a
local
texas
roadhouse
nice
12
inch
head
which
stayed
most
of
the
glass
couldnt
tell
much
from
the
aroma
since
i
just
fired
down
half
a
rack
o
ribs
golden
dark
color
also
looked
nice
definite
hops
bitterness
but
not
as
strong
as
some
all
in
all
a
nice
alternative
to
the
typical
bmc
offering
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
west
coast
pale
example
well
worth
each
sip
this
went
great
w
my
roast
duckling
entree
mouthfeel
is
very
good
carbonation
hits
just
right
and
among
pale
ales
its
extremely
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
ales
and
its
still
a
terrific
standby
one
of
americas
classics
i
can
remember
buying
a
case
of
this
stuff
a
year
and
some
change
ago
and
being
very
overwhelmed
by
the
bitterness
now
it
is
a
shadow
of
its
self
in
my
eyes
see
what
time
doesthis
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
if
there
wasnt
any
other
type
of
craft
beer
there
not
because
it
sucks
but
just
because
its
not
moving
me
anymore
there
are
plenty
of
hoppier
beers
out
there
that
overpower
this
i
dont
know
how
to
say
that
without
dogging
the
beer
looks
decent
enough
smells
like
rind
the
malt
instead
of
light
and
crisp
tastes
bready
and
doesnt
serve
to
balance
the
hops
the
beer
is
way
overhopped
tasting
of
acrid
pine
needles
the
bitterness
is
obnoxious
and
the
beer
isnt
refreshing
or
balanced
horribly
overrated
just
like
everything
else
from
sierra
nevada
the
aroma
is
floral
fresh
and
is
very
inviting
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
first
sip
is
a
little
bitter
for
an
apa
but
it
finished
crisp
and
very
smooth
almost
creamy
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
with
medium
carbination
and
the
finish
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
get
in
trouble
with
this
easy
drinking
pale
ale
great
representation
of
the
style
and
just
a
good
beer
pours
a
not
surprisingly
pale
yellowish
amber
with
a
nice
head
floral
and
pine
scent
which
blends
into
floral
hop
and
pine
taste
overtones
this
is
one
of
the
benchmark
pale
ales
and
it
stands
up
well
on
a
price
per
taste
ratio
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
but
does
have
a
nice
blend
of
party
affordability
and
taste
the
prototypical
pale
ale
that
everyone
should
have
in
their
fridge
is
it
beer
thirty
yet
d
gone
already
need
i
say
more
good
beer
for
the
summer
time
at
packs
more
a
punch
than
a
lot
of
the
widely
distributed
microbrews
second
tasting
and
i
although
many
of
the
other
characteristics
are
still
relevant
here
the
taste
was
much
different
im
not
sure
if
it
was
the
batch
or
what
but
this
brew
was
much
more
flavorful
than
my
first
tasting
the
most
notable
difference
is
the
powerful
grapefruit
and
citrus
taste
my
original
review
stated
that
i
could
not
taste
the
hints
of
those
flavors
but
perhaps
it
was
too
cold
the
first
time
around
to
add
to
my
initial
review
amazing
flavor
of
grapefruits
and
citrus
and
a
bit
wild
for
an
american
pale
ale
but
very
delicious
nonetheless
pours
a
beautifully
clear
deep
amber
with
a
two
finger
tightly
packed
head
lacing
is
always
left
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
piney
and
hoppy
with
the
cascade
hops
overpowering
the
aroma
with
its
citrusey
notes
taste
is
very
hoppy
but
balanced
well
with
toasted
malts
hints
of
caramel
and
toffe
are
noted
but
mostly
an
herbal
hoppy
presence
and
a
strong
orangegrapefruit
flavor
exceptionally
mouth
filling
but
easy
drinking
despite
the
slightly
higher
than
average
abv
it
is
remarkably
easy
drinking
perhaps
the
most
wellcrafted
pale
ale
made
in
the
usa
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
overall
i
consider
this
a
good
representation
of
the
style
with
the
availability
as
it
is
it
isnt
something
i
need
to
seek
out
but
its
a
good
goto
beer
especially
when
options
may
run
thin
d
uh
yeah
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
and
its
definitely
my
go
to
beer
when
im
lookin
for
a
bullseye
right
up
there
with
old
speckled
hen
and
sam
adams
boston
lager
nice
drink
after
a
dinner
not
a
really
beer
for
a
lot
i
would
soon
for
this
one
have
really
come
to
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
in
recent
months
one
of
the
best
i
have
access
to
d
pretty
good
overall
i
had
this
in
a
blind
tasting
with
liberty
ale
and
hopalicious
ale
asylum
it
came
in
third
not
bad
but
not
life
altering
crisp
and
light

more
aromatic
and
an

here
is
the
template
for

still
tastes
great
after
all
these
years
if
its
not
broke
goes
great
with
spicey

bbq
burgers
pizza
indian
and
seafood
dishes
also
pair
well
one
of
many
fine
sierra
nevada
beers
and
a
brewery
thats
a
source
of
pride
for
american
brewing
d
an
excellent
apa
that
i
will
definitely
buy
again
highly
drinkable
and
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
even
at
the
5
6
abv
the
taste
starts
of
with
some
citrus
malt
and
has
a
great
dry
bitter
finish
i
would
have
this
in
my
fridge
often
if
only
it
were
more
readily
available
to
me
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
strong
hops
avoid
this
beer
i
do
agree
with
the
comment
about
this
being
budweiser
with
hops
if
you
want
a
great
microbrew
pale
ale
without
huge
amounts
of
hops
i
recommend
dogfish
head
amber
ale
or
fat
tire
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
beer
and
always
will
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
great
white
head
smells
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
very
well
balanced
sweet
malt
with
a
good
use
of
bittering
and
aroma
hops
one
of
the
best
interpretations
of
the
american
pale
ale
out
there
the
version
on
tap
isnt
quite
as
good
likely
due
to
this
version
being
bottle
conditioned
light
amber
in
color
with
little
head
and
mild
tracing
this
a
delectable
brew
for
sure
has
a
solid
but
not
overpowering
hop
smell
starts
bitter
but
the
bitterness
doesnt
linger
it
becomes
sweet
and
finishes
smooth
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
especially
good
on
a
warm
summer
day
for
every
great
beer
in
america
there
are
1000
poor
excuses
for
beer
sn
pale
ale
is
the
perfect
beer
at
the
perfect
price
available
everywhere
we
all
look
at
the
lists
of
great
beers
and
hope
we
can
run
across
a
few
when
were
lucky
sn
pale
ale
is
easy
to
find
easy
to
share
and
easy
to
enjoy
kudos
to
sierra
nevada
for
providing
us
with
this
america
classic
i
dont
think
ive
ever
sessioned
this
beer
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
the
carbonation
sneaks
up
and
i
tend
to
feel
full
after
a
couple
a
very
nice
choice
in
the
style
great
beer
to
go
with
a
sandwich
a
solid
choice
to
always
keep
on
hand
if
you
like
your
taste
buds
treat
them
to
one
of
these
overall
a
very
goodeasily
found
brew
ive
tried
to
be
kind
because
im
just
not
used
to
drinking
hoppy
beer
but
am
trying
to
expand
my
horizons
i
can
see
where
the
hopheads
would
like
this
one
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
drinkability
is
quite
high
due
to
the
nearly
perfect
balance
what
can
i
say
simply
a
classic
and
my
first
beer
experience
period
and
one
that
has
converted
countless
not
my
favorite
pale
but
it
will
always
have
a
soft
spot
with
me
because
of
the
memories
d
very
drinkable
this
was
the
first
pale
ale
i
ever
really
started
drinking
frequently
which
led
to
my
love
of
the
ipa
and
dipa
style
highly
recommended
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
on
all
subsequent
tastings
i
dont
think
snpa
is
as
good
as
lcpa
it
is
the
benchmark
beer
of
its
style
and
very
drinkable
with
pleasant
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
however
it
lacks
the
fresh
hoppy
character
of
the
best
beers
american
pale
ales
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
no
bottling
date
on
a
hard
pour
it
has
a
nice
white
head
clear
goldenyellow
color
great
retention
soft
aromas
and
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
malt
and
honey
finishes
cleanly
with
a
brush
of
the
hops
tastes
travel
well
lightbodied
mouthfeel
continuous
carbonation
adds
to
the
head
although
it
doesnt
bite
the
tongue
not
the
most
powerful
flavors
but
a
wellbalanced
session
beer
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
drinkability
decent
beer
best
i
could
find
at
game
day
nothing
special
im
sure
that
ill
have
more
wouldnt
turn
one
down
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
generous
fluffy
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
cascade
hoppiness
flavor
is
citrusy
but
is
ultimately
nicely
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malt
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
that
has
become
available
everywhere
drinkability
is
very
high
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
this
ontap
at
union
hall
in
brooklyn
the
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
not
really
much
to
the
smell
besides
the
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
slighly
malty
and
a
bit
bitter
pale
ales
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
was
enjoyable
not
sure
if
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
one
time
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
bitter
ones
overall
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
very
hoppy
and
very
good
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
it
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
after
seeing
the
ratings
and
that
it
was
readily
available
at
a
good
price
in
my
area
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
was
disappointed
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
it
was
a
good
beer
crisp
and
clean
but
there
was
nothing
special
about
it
i
smelled
some
hops
but
not
what
i
would
have
expected
and
i
tasted
hops
but
nothing
like
i
would
expect
from
something
with
the
words
pale
and
ale
in
the
name
i
would
but
it
again
only
for
a
social
gathering
the
budweiser
crowd
would
not
be
put
off
but
the
beer
drinkers
would
find
something
drinkable
in
the
refrigerator
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
only
delicious
in
every
way
but
balanced
nonfilling
and
crisp
a
delightful
brew
to
enjoy
d
very
tasty
not
harsh
in
any
way
so
it
disappears
very
quickly
too
often
this
is
the
only
really
good
beer
in
okc
sports
bars
so
its
gotten
me
quite
a
few
psu
losses
of
course
its
even
better
in
celebration
always
a
good
choice
even
when
the
bar
has
a
decent
selection
d
a
very
nice
beer
and
something
you
could
start
someone
down
the
path
to
good
beer
with
not
all
that
expensive
either
me
however
i
would
rather
be
drinking
great
lakes
burning
river
if
im
looking
for
a
well
priced
pale
ale
a
fairly
thin
looking
golden
brew
with
a
thin
head
and
a
solid
white
lace
a
yeasty
lemon
aroma
with
evidence
of
hops
my
first
taste
reveals
an
aqueous
grapefruit
and
hops
combination
somewhat
tangy
but
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
mildly
complex
and
a
very
nice
choice
despite
its
relative
accessibility
always
enjoyable
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
thick
sticky
head
aroma
is
mostly
citrusy
hops
with
some
pale
malt
in
the
background
flavor
is
certainly
focused
on
hops
but
remains
fairly
balanced
more
citrusy
grapefruit
flavor
with
a
rounded
bitterness
that
complements
the
slightly
sweet
maltiness
ive
had
less
hoppy
ipas
but
style
is
much
less
important
than
deliciousness
d
i
find
it
very
drinkable
but
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
those
nw
cascade
hops
youll
hate
it
so
ill
have
to
give
it
a
slightly
marginal
rating
but
as
i
said
i
love
it
this
is
a
great
summer
and
fall
beer
and
cheap
enough
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
if
youre
on
a
budget
ive
also
heard
it
mentioned
that
this
beer
brought
the
pale
ale
style
to
america
and
shows
off
the
cascade
hop
variety
beautifully
drinkability
definately
my
session
beer
at
the
bar
with
5
6
alcohol
cont
its
rather
high
for
a
beer
you
can
easily
find
in
a
grocery
store
for
a
college
party
get
something
cheaper
at
79
dollars
around
here
it
can
be
pricey
for
those
of
us
in
a
pinch
but
when
i
want
something
good
and
cant
get
my
ass
to
the
bev
cent
this
is
my
choice
cant
go
wrong
with
sierra
nevada
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
large
foamy
offwhite
head
that
dies
down
quickly
to
a
thin
but
solid
chunky
layer
light

aroma
is
pale
malts

dough
cookie
biscuit

and
spicy
piney

a
touch

mouthfeel
is
fizzy
tangy
with
a

buttery

and
spicy
resin
hops
with
a
distant

rich
nutty

in
the
finish
bittersweet
leafy
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
good
on
draft
or
in
the
bottle
it
is
better
cold
it
loses
some
of
its
kick
when
it
gets
warmer
i
can
really
taste
the
hoppy
flavor
come
through
in
the
draft
it
has
a
citrus
flavor
that
blends
to
a
barkynutty
taste
try
it
on
draft
the
wholesome
balanced
taste
is
well
complimented
by
the
smooth
medium
body
again
balance
comes
to
mind
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
im
wishing
i
had
another
very
refreshing
very
versatile
i
could
see
this
beer
pairing
well
with
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
foods
pretty
much
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
theres
hardly
any
denying
that
there
may
be
better
examples
out
there
but
no
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
embodies
the
characteristics
of
a
classic
apa
like
this
one
always
a
great
fallback
beer
to
boot
as
many
places
with
soso
beer
selections
will
have
this
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
you
obviously
need
to
do
so
drinkability
a
solid
ale
could
have
this
again
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
where
the
bottle
is
much
better
than
the
tap
the
layer
of
brewers
yeast
from
the
bottle
really
adds
to
the
appearance
the
aroma
between
draft
and
bottle
are
about
the
same
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
from
the
bottle
version
tops
the
draft
the
hopflavor
comes
through
much
better
in
the
bottle
its
hard
not
to
praisethis
beer
i
have
enjoyed
it
for
years
yet
have
never
written
a
review
when
i
need
a
break
from
ipas
imperial
and
double
ipas
there
is
nothing
like
a
sierra
nevada
its
one
of
the
original
micros
and
incredibly
convenient
since
its
sold
almost
everywhere
a
session
beer
she
be
das
a
beer
lover
this
is
one
you
are
always
happy
with
the
brewery
may
have
gotten
bigger
but
it
has
done
the
trick
for
me
for
years
plus
you
get
many
non
beer
lovers
to
go
over
the
line
with
this
in
the
past
this
beer
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
very
good
looking
beer
great
for
the
summer
although
a
little
strong
for
any
kind
of
a
session
beer
orange
rhine
comes
to
mind
in
the
aroma
and
taste
as
well
but
floral
and
earthy
scents
are
predominate
bitter
in
the
finish
but
not
overpowering
bready
buiscuty
malts
show
up
first
on
the
palate
then
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
later
great
drinking
beer
anytime
of
the
year
mild
enough
but
too
many
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
so
be
careful
just
a
great
beer
pours
a
goldencopper
color
thick
head
that
reduces
to
lace
smell
is
light
to
me
some
piney
hops
and
grass
is
all
i
detect
i
taste
citrus
first
followed
by
malt
sweetness
then
piney
hops
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
oil
to
the
mouthfeel
nice
and
highly
drinkable
a
classic
from
a
great
brewery
d
very
good
low
in
alcohol
excellent
taste
makes
for
a
great
drinkability
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
american
hops
it
is
inexpensive
and
available
almost
anywhere
so
i
often
pick
it
up
and
know
i
will
have
an
enjoyable
experience
i
cant
help
thinking
it
was
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
in
the
united
states
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
from
the
bottle
if
a
little
too
strong
for
a
session
beer
nice
clear
golden
color
just
a
hint
of
haze
nice
hints
of
citrus
maybe
lemon
somewhat
light
taste
hoppiness
is
subtle
not
alot
of
carbonation
just
like
i
like
it
its
a
really
good
pale
ale
i
thought
it
was
pretty
smooth
not
much
of
a
aftertaste
it
may
just
be
the
familiar
nature
of
the
beer
but
it
seems
better
than
the
scores
ive
given
its
components
would
suggest
appearance
has
a
light
orange
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
is
a
light
hop
and
malt
taste
is
biscuty
with
light
citrus
tones
with
a
good
hop
bite
that
leaves
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
a
well
done
beer
but
i
also
wouldnt
consider
it
a
session
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
wellrounded
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
as
expected
but
not
more
than
expected
which
is
why
i
rated
it
straight
4s
since
it
meets
all
my
expectations
i
feel
that
it
is
probably
one
of
the
more
established
apas
available
as
it
is
not
trying
to
be
anything
it
shouldnt
be
great
beer
notes
this
beer
is
a
staple
of
craft
brewing
probably
the
single
most
common
craft
beer
youll
find
on
the
west
coast
its
a
solid
pale
ale
nothing
incredible
and
a
bit
overrated
in
my
opinioin
but
nonetheless
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
decent
gateway
into
craft
beer
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
was
a
nice
orangeamber
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
cirtus
hops
and
some
light
malt
the
taste
was
more
hops
than
malt
with
a
little
bitterness
and
hoppy
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkabilty
was
very
good
its
a
good
tasting
easy
to
find
apa
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
has
a
strong
floral
hoppy
smell
to
it
it
smells
how
i
expect
an
apa
so
smell
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
piney
taste
and
ends
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
compared
to
other
pale
ales
that
ive
tried
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
if
i
was
back
home
in
cali
but
its
pretty
expensive
out
here
in
guam
d
i
held
this
beer
up
against
alpha
king
because
i
wanted
to
know
the
differences
and
boy
are
they
evident
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
very
solid
beer
and
one
that
i
will
always
come
back
to
poured
a
sparkling
clear
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
faded
a
bit
too
quickly
not
much
hops
in
the
nose
but
smells
of
apricot
peach
and
cereal
which
matches
the
sweet
malty
taste
oooo
an
assertive
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
lingers
and
prickles
the
tongue
this
is
an
awesome
american
pale
ale
that
paved
the
way
for
the
rest
thanks
sierra
nevada
for
showing
us
the
light
d
this
is
a
very
good
apa
it
almost
has
the
hop
power
of
an
ipa
great
malt
flavor
too
thank
goodness
that
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
so
readily
available
in
bottles
and
on
tap
it
is
often
the
only
beer
that
interests
me
in
places
where
most
patrons
want
the
usual
suspects

to

inch
thick
foamy
beige
head
that
slowy
fades
away
leaving
some
good
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
full
of
orange
and
citrus
hops
along
with
some
light
caramel
notes
the
flavor
is
a
very
crisp
gragefruit
and
orange
that
bites
your
tounge
on
impact
the
bitterness
is
very
quick
and
agreeable
excellent
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
flavor
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
light
dose
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
well
done
pale
ale
that
is
widely
available
in
most
restaurants
and
bars
if
the
beer
list
is
limited
you
cant
go
wrong
choosing
this
one
d
a
session
beer
all
the
way
nothing
over
the
top
crazy
and
that
is
what
makes
it
good
worth
a
try
this
is
a
great
everyday
beer
always
worth
the
price
to
grab
a
half
rack
of
sierra
nevada
for
the
weekend
consistant
and
clean
nice
and
hoppy
with
good
flavor
balence
and
highly
drinkable
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
for
a

as
close
to

the

this
beers
taste
explains
the
american
classic
reverence
i
have
heard
other
beer
drinkers
offer
although
i
dont
like
piling
ales
on
top
of
each
other
in
one
sitting
a
six
of
this
beer
will
do
for
a
spring
evening
gathering
bottom
line
is
that
its
overall
a
very
acceptable
ale
i
reccomend
this
to
anyone
just
to
try
its
worth
it
very
drinkable
the
sierra
nevada
beers
are
extremely
good
i
like
this
one
as
far
as
ales
go
but
i
prefer
lagersporter
typical
of
sierra
nevada
is
good
lacing
nice
standing
head
and
a
damn
good
beer
sierra
nevada
is
right
up
there
with
sam
adams
definately
shouldnt
be
overlooked
in
a
sea
of
beers
at
a
huge
liqour
store
this
is
a
pale
ale
done
just
right
this
is
a
beer
ive
had
a
bunch
of
times
but
never
reviewed
but
i
w
had
it
last
night
and
wanted
to
put
it
up
i
love
it
because
its
so
readily
available
relatively
cheap
and
comes
from
what
isnt
really
a
micro
brew
beer
but
stands
up
really
well
it
has
a
great
hop
burst
of
flavor
with
some
grapefruit
in
it
a
solid
body
of
malt
and
a
great
smoothness
that
does
a
great
job
of
showing
a
great
smooth
hoppy
beer
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
while
not
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
it
is
nonetheless
one
of
my
favorites
why
very
good
taste
especially
considering
its
wide
availability
and
relatively
low
price
for
what
it
is
and
especially
coming
from
what
is
essentially
a
macrobrewer
its
damn
good
it
has
a
permanent
space
in
my
fridge
well
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
tried
and
seeing
as
how
i
graduated
college
on
friday
52507
and
i
celebated
with
a
few
of
these
i
might
as
well
review
it
here
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
macro
produced
beer
available
and
it
is
macroproduced
cheers
to
sn
for
making
such
a
quality
product
so
available
and
drinkable
for
the
masses
snpa
is
like
a
delicious
budweiser
it
is
available
everywhere
just
about
everyone
can
enjoy
this
and
even
beer
geeks
like
us
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
i
can
sit
and
sip
or
drink
to
get
drunk
and
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
will
always
be
in
my
fridge
good
stuff
smooth
pale
ale
that
can
be
enjoyed
over
the
evening
in
several
bottles
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
be
consumed
multiple
times
throughout
the
night
in
the
end
i
consider
this
one
to
be
a
totally
refreshing
totally
sessionable
and
totally
american
brew
12oz
bottle
of
a
classic
beer
which
i
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
light
orange
yellow
and
clear
the
head
is
a
frothy
white
cloud
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
i
also
detect
a
perfume
quality
the
taste
is
crisp
and
also
has
elements
of
perfume
very
balanced
and
the
drink
ability
is
awesome
i
could
easily
put
down
a
sixer
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
sometimes
i
do
drink
this
beer
all
day
session
session
session
a
nice
pale
very
well
hopped
may
have
to
start
keeping
this
in
the
fridge
d
good
beer
but
not
great
for
session
and
not
interesting
enough
for
repeat
tasting
really
good
for
d
very
drinkable
understandable
why
this
has
the
reputation
it
does
and
is
a
staple
in
so
many
beer
fridges
i
really
enjoyed
rediscovering
it
and
will
make
it
a
point
to
drink
more
often
recommended
as
a
solid
flavorful
sessionable
everyday
beer
thanks
elizabeth
for
picking
it
up
i
still
remember
the
first
time
i
encountered
this
beer
many
many
years
ago
in
california
i
knew
right
then
that
my
days
of
drinking
miller
coors
and
ab
products
were
over
forever
for
that
i
will
always
be
grateful
just
an
excellent
beer
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
theres
a
faint
aroma
of
hops
and
not
much
else
the
beer
tastes
kind
of
hoppy
at
first
but
then
fades
into
a
sweet
malty
backbone
from
what
i
gather
about
pale
ales
they
should
never
be
too
hoppy
or
too
malty
this
one
is
well
balanced
but
i
would
think
that
it
would
taste
better
straight
from
a
tap
drinkability
drinkable
would
not
turn
down
if
offered
for
free
i
needed
food
to
fight
off
the
bitterness
not
too
happy
with
this
one
the
now
widely
available
classic
and
one
of
my
first
pale
ales
this
helped
start
me
on
my
road
to
better
beers
i
managed
to
talk
the
manager
of
my
local
dive
bar
into
getting
this
on
tap
so
now
i
have
something
to
drink
when
im
at
that
shithole
playing
golden
tee
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
small
creamy
head
light
caramel
malts
and
citric
floral
hops
in
the
nose
all
of
which
are
subtle
aromas
to
me
now
but
they
were
huge
some
time
ago
light
caramel
malt
sweetness
at
the
start
well
balanced
out
by
a
decent
hop
bitterness
slightly
sour
and
crisp
finish
lightmedium
in
body
and
very
sesionable
im
glad
this
is
now
widely
available
but
selling
to
the
evil
empire
of
retailers
walmart
scares
me
for
some
reason
d
this
is
really
drinkable
and
im
glad
i
had
it
i
will
have
it
again
snpa
is
a
true
american
classic
this
brew
is
crisp
refreshing
and
damn
tasty
i
dont
really
buy
this
beer
much
and
every
time
i
do
i
wonder
why
a
nice
offering
when
on
tap
for
a
night
of
drinking
id
take
blue
moon
the
aftertaste
is
less
pronounced
nice
example
of
the
apa
style
the
hops
are
a
little
out
front
very
drinkale
beer
actually
have
had
many
sessions
with
this
beer
have
not
had
this
in
awhile
wonderful
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
heavy
at
all
great
session
brew
not
sure
why
i
always
looked
over
this
one
when
i
saw
it
ontap
but
that
wont
happen
as
often
now
poured
a
beautiful
clear
rich
golden
color
with
a
14
inch
off
white
head
and
frothy
lacing
down
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
has
a
real
nice
scent
of
grapefruit
and
floral
hops
tastes
good
you
get
a
real
nice
citrus
flavor
with
barley
malt
and
a
floral
hop
finish
this
beer
is
really
light
smooth
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
for
those
beginning
their
hop
journey
i
think
it
would
be
great
on
a
nice
summer
day
drinkability
i
have
to
say
this
brew
just
impresses
me
the
more
and
more
pale
ales
i
drink
i
find
the
catagory
to
not
be
overly
impressive
but
this
one
of
the
originals
still
stands
out
as
one
of
the
elite
and
makes
for
an
excellent
brew
with
a
spicey
meal
i
especially
like
the
aftertaste
and
the
bitterness
gives
it
a
nice
kick
the
grapefruit
flavor
i
can
deal
with
but
its
a
bit
strong
im
fine
with
just
one
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
5
6
abv
really
propels
this
to
a
session
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
allaround
beers
especially
for
a
session
i
expect
that
most
here
have
tried
this
if
you
havent
you
must
d
a
good
everyday
beer
a
perfect
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
very
solid
apa
definitely
a
paragon
of
the
style
recommended
it
goes
well
with
many
dishes
and
is
welcome
for
many
different
events
final
statement
wow
this
is
different
from
the
pale
ales
ive
tried
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
very
impressed
with
this
west
coast
pale
ale
highly
recommend
whats
to
say
that
hasnt
been
said
its
a
westcoast
classic
with
its
own
unique
beat
typical
of
american
styles
it
leans
towards
the
hoppy
profile
with
a
grapefruitcitrus
aroma
from
draft
it
has
a
creamy
feel
thats
good
to
the
last
drop
im
glad
to
hear
from
casual
beer
drinkers
that
this
is
on
thier
list
for
thier
favorite
beers
so
it
has
appeal
for
everyone
a
decent
apa
if
you
like
the
grapefruit
thing
12oz
bottle
of
a
classic
beer
which
i
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
light
orange
yellow
and
clear
the
head
is
a
frothy
white
cloud
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
i
also
detect
a
perfume
quality
the
taste
is
crisp
and
also
has
elements
of
perfume
very
balanced
and
the
drinkability
is
awesome
i
could
easily
put
down
a
sixer
pours
a
copper
color
into
pint
glass
with
off
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
floral
hops
and
malts
taste
is
an
intricate
blend
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
some
carmel
malts
and
a
biscuit
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
every
sip
begs
for
another
excellent
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
i
believe
this
is
the
standard
to
judge
all
apas
against
it
is
a
very
good
but
not
spectacular
apa
that
is
readily
available
goes
well
with
pizza
or
barbeque
and
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
is
5
6
i
would
love
to
see
more
of
the
sierra
nevada
products
available
in
bottles
not
too
sure
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
something
smoother
perhaps
certainly
not
the
young
dry
tinny
flavours
which
i
found
i
will
try
another
in
the
summer
maybe
to
see
if
the
warmer
weather
helps
me
see
its
characteristics
in
a
better
light
m
good
carbonation
refreshing
not
too
thin
but
probably
less
than
medium
yes
this
really
is
a
classic
pale
ale
and
worthy
of
its
reputation
this
is
a
great
beer
its
very
smooth
and
goes
down
smooth
there
is
a
definate
taste
of
hops
with
a
finish
of
hopbitterness
however
the
bitter
finish
is
by
no
means
overpowering
there
is
a
semi
complex
flavor
profile
but
still
simple
enough
for
someone
new
to
pale
ales
a
great
first
pale
ale
but
one
that
you
will
come
back
to
great
pale
ale
and
great
beer
must
try
overall
this
beer
is
one
that
i
often
overlook
it
is
not
anything
special
but
i
think
i
should
give
it
the
attention
it
deserves
in
the
future
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
nice
sticky
foam
head
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
with
a
little
grapefruit
and
something
that
comes
across
as
bready
the
taste
is
a
little
different
than
i
would
expect
from
the
aroma
light
biscuity
malt
with
hints
of
the
citrus
hops
followed
by
a
pleasant
but
neutral
flavored
bittering
it
has
a
clean
finish
and
very
good
drinkability
i
have
sessioned
this
brew
quite
a
few
times
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
apa
and
is
always
reliable
and
tasty
not
hard
to
see
why
this
one
is
a
classic
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
lots
of
character
in
this
one
i
have
not
had
this
on
tap
in
a
long
time
very
good
brew
that
is
without
a
doubt
a
classic
pale
ale
pretty
much
all
hops
awesome
hop
bitterness
that
finishes
off
the
complex
citrusy
hop
flavors
be
sure
to
try
this
one
on
a
clean
palatte
to
give
it
full
justice
a
very
pleasant
beer
color
is
an
absolutely
gorgeous
golden
amber
that
promises
an
excellent
brew
aroma
is
hoppy
and
pleasant
flavor
is
hoppy
with
some
bitterness
not
much
on
complexity
but
nice
smooth
and
tingly
it
works
by
itself
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
meal
recommended
overall
this
is
the
beer
that
really
introduced
the
pale
ale
to
america
and
theres
no
wonder
why
it
is
held
in
such
high
regards
snpa
is
an
ale
everyone
should
experience
both
as
a
great
brew
and
as
a
vanguard
of
the
american
microbrew
revolution
overall
this
is
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
mostly
for
its
balance
i
do
enjoy
ipas
from
time
to
time
too
especially
bridgeport
and
other
pacific
nw
beers
but
for
apas
this
beer
is
something
else
taste
has
some
hops
wheaty
bread
notes
and
a
bit
of
sour
mash
and
metal
not
amazingly
good
by
any
means
but
a
cut
above
most
grocery
store
beers
feels
a
bit
too
dry
but
leaves
a
good
bubbly
bite
along
with
a
decent
lingering
aftertaste
of
hops
it
drinks
well
enough
but
doesnt
have
enough
hops
or
depth
for
me
this
beer
is
simply
one
of
the
best
in
its
class
it
is
a
delicious
american
pale
ale
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
tastes
very
good
the
hop
taste
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
one
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
with
no
regrets
another
thing
that
is
good
about
this
beer
is
the
price
it
is
very
affordable
for
its
style
cheers
always
an
enjoyable
beer
for
me
and
i
always
reach
for
this
one
when
i
want
an
apa
darn
tasty
nice
gold
orange
color
off
white
one
inch
head
held
fairly
well
with
a
moderate
lacing
smell
is
apple
peach
lemon
citrus
i
catch
a
bit
of
each
taste
bready
malt
with
hint
of
caramel
up
front
and
lemongrass
citrus
finish
but
without
that
bitter
rind
taste
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
ok
easy
drinker
good
session
beer
taste
is
like
what
that
sip
went
down
so
fast
and
easy
that
i
have
to
have
another
then
maybe
another
it
strikes
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
thats
forsure
theres
nothing
outlandish
here
just
a
very
clean
citric
flavour
and
lots
of
earthy
bittering
hop
character
the
nutty
malt
is
just
enough
to
balance
things
out
theres
a
very
mild
caramellike
sweetness
in
the
background
but
nothing
cloying
to
be
sure
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
and
pleasing
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
but
not
obnoxious
and
the
body
is
just
perfect
for
the
style
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
finish
is
dry
drinkability
this
is
almost
the
definition
of
drinkable
perfect
for
any
time
of
the
year
and
if
i
could
buy
it
in
canada
it
just
might
be
a
constant
in
my
fridge
doesnt
disappoint
pours
clear
and
golden
with
foamy
head
about
12
which
quickly
dissipates
leaving
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
citrusy
hops
and
toasty
malt
medium
body
with
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beerseasy
to
drink
with
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
and
available
at
most
all
barsdistributors
in
the
area
i
remember
years
back
when
i
first
tried
snpa
thinking
how
great
it
was
and
it
would
make
me
pucker
then
being
introduced
to
ipas
and
doubles
i
kind
of
forgot
about
sierra
probally
the
beer
responsible
for
my
neverending
hop
quest
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
old
faithful
if
im
ever
stranded
on
a
desert
island
and
am
given
the
opportunity
to
choose
one
and
only
one
beer
to
live
with
for
the
rest
of
my
days
sn
pale
ale
has
to
be
on
the
candidate
list
is
it
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
well
no
but
it
is
perhaps
the
best
every
day
beer
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
like
a
fishtank
full
and
never
get
tired
of
it
it
has
the
pentultimate
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
an
awesome
bouquet
of
well
everything
if
some
day
i
ever
have
the
guts
it
takes
to
start
my
own
brewery
i
only
hope
my
flagship
brew
is
as
good
as
this
or
if
i
start
my
dream
tavern
some
day
there
will
always
be
a
tap
reserved
for
sn
pale
ale
overall
a
very
good
session
beer
a
good
standard
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
very
enjoyable
great
beer
for
burgers
or
munchies
poured
a
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
left
some
nice
lacing
as
i
drank
it
the
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malts
a
bit
metallic
a
bit
of
grapefruit
in
the
taste
hops
are
not
too
pronounced
but
provide
a
lovely
flavor
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
balance
the
ale
perhaps
the
best
balance
of
flavorful
hops
and
solid
malt
presence
it
is
well
carbonated
as
apparent
by
the
numerous
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
flavorful
hoppy
sweetness
if
that
makes
sense
this
is
an
extremly
drinkable
and
flavorful
apa
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
leaves
some
nice
lacing
too
aromas
of
fresh
hops
citrus
some
malt
flavor
has
a
nice
malt
presence
which
i
enjoyed
along
with
the
refreshing
citric
hop
bite
some
hints
of
caramel
as
well
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
a
great
classic
snpa
is
just
a
solid
apa
a
classic
american
pale
ale
my
bottle
was
a
bit
old
so
i
think
some
of
the
hop
character
faded
with
time
the
measuring
stick
period
considering
this
beer
is
distibuted
more
widely
than
many
other
beers
rated
on
this
site
id
say
its
pretty
darn
consistent
this
being
said
i
still
gave
it
a
strict
review
i
have
always
respected
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
over
many
others
of
its
style
its
one
you
can
come
back
to
and
one
that
you
can
find
more
easily
than
the
rest
nice
american
pale
ale
good
good
stuff
this
is
truly
a
fantastic
brew
we
are
lucky
to
see
this
across
the
country
at
selected
grocers
the
nose
is
grassy
of
hops
and
sweet
of
semisweet
chocolate
the
beer
pours
a
amber
color
with
lots
of
small
bubbles
but
the
beer
is
carbonated
perfectly
the
taste
starts
with
the
grapefruit
and
then
graduates
to
some
beautiful
malted
goodness
with
some
roastedness
to
it
this
is
where
the
sweetness
and
richnesschocolatyness
and
some
other
palate
cleaning
bitterness
of
late
hops
balance
things
out
exceptional
especially
for
its
availability
for

is

a

id
say
it
blows
away
most
nearly
all
the

on

support
well
made
domestic
brews
like
this
ill
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
favorite
mug
as
expected
from
the
style
pour
produced
small
head
which
left
behind
little
lacing
dark
golden
color
seemed
just
a
bit
hazy
but
still
appealing
got
a
nice
aroma
of
piney
hops
but
not
overpowering
smooth
enjoyable
flavor
i
liked
this
beer
even
though
i
prefer
a
darker
beer
with
a
more
prounced
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
carbonated
a
nice
balanced
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
the
flavor
is
very
solid
the
hops
dont
overpower
the
balance
as
is
the
case
with
some
apas
but
are
noticeable
and
distinguished
it
is
balanced
by
a
malt
backbone
for
a
smooth
enjoyable
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
too
carbonated
and
smooth
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
apas
out
there
for
my
money
d
highly
drinkable
good
beer
to
have
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
hoppy
but
nothing
to
overwhelm
you
something
i
always
have
around
a
very
easily
drinkable
pale
ale
reliable
standby
to
have
at
any
bar
wow
the
hefty
malt
backbone
with
the
tangy
citrus
notes
went
down
perfect
the
head
was
a
good
two
fingers
and
had
some
lacing
down
the
whole
glass
the
flowery
and
musty
earthtones
from
the
hops
really
cool
down
the
spicy
salsa
thanks
to
garrett
oliver
for
that
suggestion
who
needs
a
bad
beer
with
a
lime
i
really
do
need
to
try
this
stuff
on
tap
one
of
these
days
this
is
what
a
good
pale
ale
should
be
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
orange
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
all
hops
with
slight
citrus
the
taste
is
mostly
hops
creating
a
very
nice
citrus
flavor
with
very
little
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
this
is
just
a
great
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
session
beer
definitely
try
this
one
d
one
of

beers

high
sessionability
overall
this
is
a
good
apa
it
defined
the
style
way
back
when
and
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
clearly
one
of
americas
finest
beers
everyone
should
be
able
to
find
it
and
should
drink
it
in
this
category
i
also
enjoy

which
is
slightly
more
popular
in
the
midwest
d
i
can
drink
it
but
there
are
many

better
beers
out
there
the
best
thing
i
can

about

is
that

you
live

it

in

way

is
it
boring
however

pretty
much
just
stinky

still
find
the

to
be
obtrusive

beer
pours
an

gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
in
to
a
thick
film
that
lasts
and
laces
the
whole
way
down
the
beer
the
smell
hits
you
initially
with
the
aroma
of
the
hops
first
of
all
the
distict
floral
and
citrus
flavors
that
are
so
common
there
is
also
a
hint
of
some
lightly
toasted
pale
malts
the
taste
is
also
fantastic
the
hops
are
obviously
the
focus
of
the
beer
but
this
does
not
prevent
the
beer
from
preventing
some
delightful
sweet
and
toasted
malts
again
the
normal
floralcitrus
hops
are
most
prevalent
but
once
the
beer
is
tasted
the
citrus
flavor
seems
to
dominate
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
well
with
some
nice
thickness
there
is
also
a
welcome
dimension
of
bitterness
associated
with
this
beer
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
one
and
have
to
give
it
a
5
on
drinkability
this
is
one
i
will
come
back
to
again

again

if
it

drink
this

beer

lots
of

favorite
stuff
is
usually
too
precious
to
bust
out
every

to

this

has
become

of
the

of

american

it
just

taste
is

lighter
than
you
would
expect
from
a
dark
beer
well
balanced
between
the
biscuity

and
the
sharp
hop
bite
a
true
american
classic
d
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
easy
to
drink
pairs
well
with
most
foods
and
works
fabulously
as
a
session
beer
drinkability
at
5
6
it
is
not
exactly
a
session
beer
but
it
goes
down
very
easy
drinkability
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
even
with
all
the
hop
flavor
im
picking
up
due
to
the
fact
that
the
hops
enhance
the
experience
rather
than
pummelling
the
tastebuds
a
great
all
around
drinkable
beer
great
with
food
or
by
itself
very
drinkable
an
allaround
great
beer
i
see
why
this
is
such
a
staple
of
the
beer
drinking
world
apas
may
not
be
my
favorite
but
within
the
style
this
is
hard
to
beat
a
refreshing
brew
with
light
body
and
light
carbonation
very
drinkable
not
outstanding
for
any
reason
but
good
opinion
this
beer
is
a
staple
of
any
american
beer
aficionados
diet
it
is
pretty
readily
available
and
tastes
good
this
makes
it
common
at
beer
gatherings
the
beer
overall
is
really
drinkable
even
if
you
arent
a
hophead
like
myself
here
in
houston
it
goes
great
with
some
bbq
at
the
local
park
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
what
a
great
beer
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
it
does
not
have
all
the
characteristics
that
i
truly
enjoy
but
its
balance
is
so
good
its
incredible
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
followed
by
a
fruity
but
not
over
powering
body
finished
by
a
slight
pine
ending
tops
in
its
class
next
time
fishing
with
the
old
man
im
taking
some
of
these
along
hell
appreciate
it
after
the
last
outing
with
a
halfer
of
pabst
nose
is
malty
and
a
bit
yeasty
with
some
nice
floral
hops
coming
through
pours
a
wonderful
amber
with
a
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
and
appearance
combine
to
make
this
a
most
enticing
libation
first
sip
starts
with
some
pleasant
sweet
maltiness
and
finishes
with
enough
lingering
hop
spicy
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
medium
to
full
bodied
for
a
pale
ale
and
coats
the
mouth
nicely
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
im
glad
its
becoming
so
widely
available
i
tend
to
like
hoppy
beers
as
opposed
to
less
hoppy
beers
so
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
it
is
pale
actually
a
light
to
medium
amber
color
it
has
a
perfect
hop
aroma
and
taste
balance
one
can
definitely
feel
the
small
bite
of
the
hop
bitterness
which
i
absolutely
love
a
very
drinkable
beer
anytime
of
the
year
and
on
any
occasion
i
personally
prefer
drinking
this
beer
with
a
bacon
chesse
chicken
sandwich
and
fries
while
watching
any
kind
of
sporting
event
preferable
college
football
a
great
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
which
is
what
i
do
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
it
is
so
versatile
and
pairs
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
can
be
enjoyed
by
itself
either
in
a
pub
with
a
large
crowd
of
people
or
as
an
after
work
relaxant
the
amount
of
hop
bitterness
turns
off
some
people
though
pours
a
slightly
hazed
amber
with
a
modest
head
that
recedes
to
leave
a
nice
lacing
that
lasts
through
the
glass
mild
but
slightly
raw
hop
aroma
flavor
is
highly
hopped
floral
with
citric
overtones
hop
bitterness
is
definitely
up
there
but
a
nice
doughy
malt
backbone
keeps
it
all
together
super
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easily
drinkable
being
one
of
the
very
few
truly
well
known
craft
beers
it
commands
respect
from
american
bas
this
is
what
run
of
the
mill
pale
ales
should
be
imitating
good
stuff
again
a
good
drinkable
standby
micro
kinda
like
seeing
a
friendly
face
in
a
crowd
of
macro
strangers
poured
a
bright
golden
orange
haze
with
a
little
white
head
that
tended
to
cling
to
the
glass
smelled
of
very
strong
hops
some
floral
notes
and
some
citric
scents
aswell
tasted
nice
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
very
mild
malty
crispness
i
found
it
a
little
on
the
bitter
hop
side
but
in
an
enjoyable
way
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
ended
up
buy
another
round
of
it
so
i
would
definatly
reccomend
this
beer
i
do
recall
now
having
the
sierra
nevada
comped
on
my
stay
at
ballys
in
vegas
which
was
a
plus
kind
of
like
the
drunken
irishman
that
will
beat
the
hell
out
of
the
frat
boy
that
gets
out
of
line
the
beer
was
mediumbodied
and
drinkable
and
altogether
an
american
classic
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
today
creamy
but
grainy
flavorful
but
plain
smooth
but
cloying
maybe
this
is
a
bad
one
but
theres
some
saving
grace
due
to
it
being
a
style
that
can
handle
adversityit
does
i
do
find
it
better
ontap
though
i
had
one
at
teds
buffalo
grill
in
nashville
and
found
the
quality
muchimproved
over
the
bottled
variety
unfortunately
ive
never
found
a
place
in
alabama
that
serves
it
ontap
so
i
am
unable
to
test
this
hypothesis
in
a
reasonable
manner
hops
very
apparent
at
first
with
bitter
taste
as
beer
began
to
warm
a
malty
taste
kicked
in
that
balanced
out
the
beer
nicely
medium
body
that
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
and
one
of
my
favorites
that
is
readily
available
pours
yellow
golden
from
a
24
fluid
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
of
piney
hops
with
with
some
sweetness
head
develops
into
1
head
and
then
goes
away
within
a
minute
or
two
sip
reveals
a
piney
hops
flavor
with
some
bitterness
if
held
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
hops
seems
to
dominate
here
a
very
solid
beer
that
you
can
find
in
many
run
of
the
mill
places
not
citrusy
hops
flavor
still
a
pale
ale
without
running
into
the
ipa
category
some
slight
sweetness
too
appearance
is
a
cloudy
orange
with
white
foam
and
clinging
lace
aroma
is
floral
hops
green
leaves
and
lemon
blossoms
there
are
some
barley
and
malt
notes
too
initial
taste
caresses
the
tongue
with
silky
smooth
crackers
and
malt
balanced
by
dry
hoppiness
ethanol
fumes
work
through
the
sweet
grapefruit
hops
and
brown
sugar
good
beer
taste
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
can
get
a
bit
musky
cardboard
in
the
nose
but
the
hops
eventually
kick
its
ass
i
find
this
beer
highly
drinkable
at
5
9abv
and
a
taste
that
doesnt
make
you
want
to
switch
beers
drinkability
i
love
drinking
this
beer
it
has
never
failed
me
a
great
standard
for
the
american
pale
ale
it
is
a
wonderful
everyday
beer
for
myself
wow
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
one
of
these
and
i
forgot
how
much
i
liked
them
a
healthy
2
finger
head
that
retains
well
best
i
can
describe
the
color
is
a
hazy
orangey
gold
good
lacing
too
at
first
the
smell
is
primarily
of
hops
and
citrus
but
as
this
delight
warms
a
little
i
pick
up
a
toasted
grain
smell
the
taste
hits
the
tounge
bitter
and
hoppy
but
finishes
with
a
nice
and
balanced
sweet
malt
flavor
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
to
buy
by
the
case
i
have
yet
to
meet
someone
who
doesnt
like
this
beer
except
my
girlfriend
who
says
all
beer
tastes
the
same
some
of
the
other
sierra
nevada
stuff
is
a
little
hoppy
for
my
liking
but
this
one
is
scrumtrulecently
balanced
as
apas
go
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
out
there
assertive
but
not
ipalike
5
6
abv
a
great
representation
of
the
style
golden
with
a
tinge
of
amber
hoppy
aromas
of
grass
and
mild
citrus
some
grainy
malt
flavors
combine
with
notes
of
citrus
hops
and
white
grape
skin
assertive
but
not
overpowering
black
peppery
bitterness
not
watery
but
surprisingly
muted
this
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
but
ive
had
a
few
more
interesting
apas
than
this
one
great
taste
high
drinkability
decent
abv
widespread
availability
and
reasonable
sticker
price
make
this
one
a
winner
on
all
fronts
nice
copper
to
amber
color
very
clear
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
it
had
an
aroma
of
grapefruit
rind
very
pronounced
and
a
more
subtle
hop
flower
and
grass
aroma
backed
by
mild
caramel
on
the
finish
the
taste
has
the
citrushop
up
front
with
the
hop
flower
coming
across
subtly
the
caramel
is
very
light
on
the
finish
very
smooth
and
light
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
this
is
another
beer
that
began
the
journey
for
me
to
advocacy
it
will
always
be
a
standard
i
measure
other
apas
against
drinkability
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
my
porch
on
a
nice
day
drinkability
fantastic
session
beer
here
i
like
to
factor
cost
into
the
drinkability
equation
sometimes
and
snpa
comes
out
a
winner
for
that
reason
alone
i
love
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
it
was
the
first
craft
brew
i
ever
had
at
the
tender
age
of
16
at
the
time
it
was
a
bit
much
but
i
liked
it
it
took
me
a
few
years
before
i
really
discovered
the
style
its
still
good
fortunately
8
years
later
and
more
readily
available
this
is
my
benchmark
for
american
pale
ales
and
im
sure
im
not
alone
the
session
beer
to
end
all
session
beers
you
can
find
it
anywhere
it
tastes
great
and
it
goes
down
like
water
i
really
like
snbcs
beers
but
this
one
didnt
do
anything
for
me
poured
out
to
a
golden
color
with
decent
carbonation
odors
of
spices
were
most
present
and
were
slightly
overpowering
taste
was
complex
as
im
sure
thats
what
they
were
going
for
flavors
of
bitterness
floral
notes
and
hops
were
present
finished
with
a
smooth
yet
strong
bitter
aftertaste
in
no
way
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
better
apas
still
worth
a
try
overall
i
was
left
feeling
cheated
when
i
poured
it
with
no
head
although
it
is
much
stronger
tasteing
to
me
i
am
beginning
to
realize
what
everyone
wants
in
a
beer
the
beer
is
of
exceptional
quality
overall
the
american
pale
ale
i
find
myself
really
enjoying
this
beers
balance
after
getting
tired
of
the
extreme
ipas
well
decided
to
buy
some
again
got
introduce
to
it
back
around
97
in
ca
one
of
the
first
micros
ive
had
ive
always
liked
the
pale
ale
over
the
stout
and
porter
the
color
is
golden
brown
and
a
mild
taste
goes
down
very
easy
with
a
great
after
taste
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
pale
ale
highly
recommended
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
an
obvious
choice
for
a
sessional
brew
this
beer
goes
back
nice
and
smooth
basically
the
standard
by
which
a
good
pale
ale
should
be
compared
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
sierra
pale
ale
is
what
i
consider
a
great
beer
for
those
lazy
afternoons
lounging
around
the
house
the
pleasant
aroma
with
hints
of
yeast
and
hops
are
pleasing
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
very
apparent
and
it
is
obvious
the
care
is
put
into
this
drink
that
has
always
been
the
lasting
characteristic
of
this
beer
is
freshness
and
quality
it
is
a
beer
that
i
know
i
can
reach
for
at
anytime
and
throughly
enjoy
impression
absolutely
refreshing
a
bold
and
exciting
beer
one
that
can
be
drank
from
sunup
to
sundown
and
any
time
of
the
year
one
to
stock
the
fridge
with
edit
trying
to
calibrate
my
scores
having
trouble
keeping
it
all
internally
consistent
note
if
you
have
tried
this
beer
and
didnt
like
it
give
it
another
chance
already
sierra
nevada
distributes
aggressively
and
is
botttle
conditioned
and
some
unworthy
distributers
and
retailersgas
stations
supermarkets
etc
sometimes
store
it
warm
for
long
periods
of
time
ive
gotten
a
couple
of
brews
that
were
quite
well
lets
just
say
they
had
seen
better
days
so
pick
it
up
at
a
reputable
retailer
or
try
it
on
tap
im
sure
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
is
a
standard
among
american
pale
ales
and
i
always
enjoy
it
in
fact
i
have
not
had
a
bad
sierra
nevada
brew
if
you
havent
had
it
have
it
if
you
havent
had
it
in
a
while
go
get
some
good
session
stuff
pours
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
is
floral
piney
hops
with
a
grainy
malt
background
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
floral
and
resiny
hops
taste
that
gives
way
to
a
grainy
bready
malt
flavor
and
ends
in
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
a
pretty
standard
pale
ale
but
nonetheless
an
original
as
it
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
to
become
widely
available
sierra
nevada
is
a
nice
old
familiar
beer
that
is
thankfully
found
at
many
a
restaurant
serving
mainstream
swill
pours
a
lovely
amber
with
a
thick
finger
and
a
half
of
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
citric
and
piney
hops
with
a
definite
malt
presence
behind
flavor
is
close
to
the
nose
with
grapefruit
and
lemons
coming
through
and
a
strong
malt
backbone
simple
but
good
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
ligght
medium
side
and
the
medium
carbonation
is
just
right
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
widely
available
and
i
always
drink
when
there
are
no
better
micros
present
all
i
can
say
is
its
a
pity
you
cant
just
head
down
your
local
in
australia
and
pick
this
up
whenever
you
like
coz
its
a
pearler
of
a
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
fine
bead
of
carbonation
and
a
fantastic
assertive
citric
aroma
that
comes
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
a
carbonic
bite
then
smooth
smooth
bready
malt
flavors
accented
by
grapefruity
hops
followed
by
a
clean
bitterness
that
has
me
wanting
more
of
the
stuff
this
is
a
classic
quenching
pale
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
the
wonderfully
hoppy
character
of
this
beer
come
out
more
when
just
slightly
chilled
the
bottle
im
having
now
is
probably
just
a
bit
too
chilly
but
the
previous
bottle
was
just
perfect
this
is
an
old
favorite
and
possibly
my
1
summer
beer
would
i
buy
it
again
heck
yeah
a
classic
of
the
style
and
one
that
is
a
much
welcomed
fallback
when
the
only
other
choices
are
macros
or
skunky
imports
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
appropriate
for
all
seasons
as
it
is
heavily
hopped
and
malty
enough
to
stand
up
to
a
hearty
meal
though
fresh
and
crisp
enough
to
accompany
your
picnic
or
ballgame
medium
carmel
color
and
a
tamed
head
make
this
pale
ale
a
charming
pint
indeed
i
remember
there
was
a
time
when
the
sight
of
the
green
snpa
tap
handle
at
a
pub
was
enough
to
excite
me
i
guess
those
days
are
long
past
ill
choose
to
remember
this
beer
from
past
experiences
which
were
always
good
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
has
lead
us
all
down
the
path
of
beer
rightiousness
although
our
palates
have
grown
we
should
all
give
this
beer
its
due
and
proper
served
on
tap
medium
amber
color
head
quickly
disappeared
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smelled
slightly
malty
to
me
taste
was
very
good
i
liked
the
bite
on
the
tip
on
my
tongue
and
very
nice
bitterness
on
the
back
kinda
like
grapefruit
very
ful
feeling
in
my
mouth
great
drinkability
ill
buy
again
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
years
ago
but
it
has
been
a
long
time
the
beer
is
darker
than
i
remember
with
a
copper
amber
color
and
lots
of
carbonation
hop
aroma
is
strong
with
a
faint
smell
of
fresh
lettuce
taste
is
of
that
typical
sierra
nevada
malted
barley
a
strong
hop
flavor
for
an
apa
and
orange
rind
which
i
dont
remember
from
the
past
taste
is
good
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
a
true
classic
apa
in
my
opinion
a
very
respectable
apa
red
gold
body
with
a
1
white
head
honeyish
malt
with
very
mild
spice
in
the
nose
the
flavor
has
smooth
malt
at
the
start
followed
by
an
excellent
balance
of
hops
towards
the
end
the
hops
come
across
better
with
more
sips
gotta
love
the
balance
nothing
is
overstated
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
very
carbonated
and
it
has
a
refreshing
effect
i
wonder
about
the
drinkability
while
it
would
be
great
to
have
one
or
two
and
they
would
be
a
very
drinkable
one
or
two
having
much
more
than
that
would
be
over
doing
it
for
me
poured
a
bright
orange
color
with
robust
head
that
reduced
to
minimal
white
lacing
has
a
nice
hoppy
smell
without
being
overpowering
the
taste
has
a
pleasant
hoppiness
that
fells
great
in
the
mouth
leaves
a
nice
dryness
that
makes
me
want
more
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
that
would
be
a
good
session
beer
i
was
very
happy
when
i
first
seen
this
beer
make
it
to
my
store
shelves
this
beer
imo
sets
the
the
standard
for
all
other
pale
ales
you
can
review
my
complete
and
detailed
review
of
this
beer
at
httppilgrimspub
blogspot
com200712tastingnotes
html
its
just
that
easy
to
drink
simple
yet
elegant
its
nice
to
know
there
will
always
beer
a
beer
like
this
to
fall
back
on
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
had
a
couple
with
dinner
and
i
think
a
couple
more
are
on
deck
for
the
evening
at
least
drinkability
i
believe
this
is
the
first
5
i
have
ever
given
just
a
perfect
beer
to
drink
i
was
wrong
in
a
previous
review
this
is
the
apa
by
which
to
judge
all
other
apas
helping
this
beer
out
is
that
it
is
available
practically
all
over
i
have
seen
it
in
gas
stations
purchased
a
six
for
5
99
practically
a
steal
this
is
the
standard
pale
ale
i
suppose
one
of
my
favorites
w00t
snpa
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
light
white
head
and
has
a
nice
faint
citrus
aroma
tipping
back
the
bottle
and
taking
a
sip
i
find
a
nice
crisp
bite
and
while
the
flavor
is
good
its
not
remarkable
ive
had
better
ive
had
worse
good
not
great
its
a
tasty
brew
and
id
certainly
be
willing
to
buy
more
but
this
just
isnt
a
standout
in
my
book
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
too
special
here
pours
a
dark
golden
translucence
with
a
large
head
very
hoppy
smelling
with
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
taste
is
actually
quite
bitter
much
like
an
i
p
a
all
in
all
a
good
session
brew
and
an
one
of
my
favorite
choices
when
i
have
to
shop
at
the
grocery
store
and
cant
make
it
to
my
local
bottle
shop
so
what
upmakes
this
apa
the
answer
seems
obvious
all
them
west
coast
hops
thats
the
flavor
primarily
and
the
malt
could
only
get
in
the
way
if
it
were
to
present
itself
any
more
strongly
we
dont
want
any
of
those
stinky
esthery
sweet
flavors
coming
through
to
ruin
our
nice
green
resiny
american
hop
experience
drinkability
great
i
drank
three
pints
and
it
did
not
leave
me
bloated
like
other
filling
beers
bring
another
it
goes
down
smooth
both
when
drank
slowly
and
quickly
highly
recommended
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
sierra
nevada
beers
my
choice
of
beer
when
at
a
bar
with
mostly
a
commercial
beer
selection
perfect
session
beer
this
pale
ale
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
floral
hops
aroma
with
some
maltiness
poking
through
the
hops
the
taste
was
malty
but
with
a
very
large
dose
of
flowery
floral
hops
and
bitter
hops
especially
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
the
body
was
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
feel
the
fruity
and
floral
hops
lingered
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
very
nice
pale
ale
and
one
can
see
why
it
is
considered
a
classic
in
the
american
pale
ale
style
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
get
around
to
reviewing
it
i
am
going
to
have
to
remember
to
drink
this
one
more
often
or
at
least
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
on
tap
at
a
local
wing
joint
almost
as
tasty
as
from
the
bottle
but
i
feel
like
the
hops
dont
show
up
quite
as
well
on
tap
still
very
drinkable
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
and
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
most
of
the
taps
at
typical
bars
in
socal
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
imho
sets
the
bar
for
west
coast
pas
if
you
like
liberty
ale
or
two
hearted
give
this
one
a
try
very
clear
amber
colour
topped
by
a
thin
lace
of
white
head
moderate
retention
and
stickage
the
aroma
consists
of
floral
citrus
and
spicy
hops
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
grain
the
flavour
is
balanced
on
the
hoppy
bitter
side
mild
sweetness
with
some
maltiness
but
mostly
citrus
and
spicy
hops
with
a
dominating
bitterness
dry
finish
with
a
firm
bitterness
medium
body
and
carbonation
slightly
crisp
and
acidic
from
the
carbonation
but
without
having
a
coarse
texture
this
is
a
great
session
beer
clean
and
full
of
flavour
nothing
shabby
about
this
beer
a
great
example
of
an
apa
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
regardless
of
the
time
of
year
not
as
interesting
or
shocking
a
beer
as
it
was
15
years
ago
back
when
many
of
us
had
never
had
an
american
beer
that
was
decent
tasting
but
its
still
an
emminently
drinkable
beer
and
an
excellent
session
pa
nose
is
delicate
having
a
lot
of
hoparome
thats
mostly
citrussy
some
maltnotes
and
a
nice
yeastesterpallet
mixed
beautifully
together
taste
is
very
smotth
but
still
fresh
malts
pils
and
munich
litle
sweetish
before
going
into
that
citrussytaste
and
aftertaste
again
mouthfeel
is
great
probably
as
good
as
it
was
fresh
but
cause
of
the
age
exp
date
310105
is
freed
from
any
edges
if
there
ever
were
drinkability
is
good
only
negatively
influenced
by
the
enormous
price
of
4
eur
for
a
350
ml
botle
keep
these
around
for
session
they
are
a
sure
hit
nice
apa
but
honestly
this
is
a
pretty
standard
brew
within
the
constraints
of
the
style
very
drinkable
however
this
ale
is
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
dense
mostly
diminishing
head
with
little
lacing
early
the
aroma
is
more
malty
than
i
remembered
but
still
very
nice
its
also
a
bit
piney
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
marvelous
a
wonderful
balance
of
bready
maltiness
and
bittering
hops
the
hops
are
noticeable
right
off
the
bat
but
still
rather
mellow
but
the
bitterness
picks
up
a
bit
toward
the
finish
and
theres
a
slightly
grapey
taste
in
there
the
finish
is
crisp
medium
in
length
but
just
so
damned
easydrinking
i
think
its
sweeter
on
tap
than
from
bottle
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
out
there
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
tough
on
the
senses
the
hops
are
too
much
for
me
i
had
to
rate
it
a
little
above
average
because
it
has
a
respectable
power
and
bite
had
this
before
of
course
but
never
rated
it
read
a
lot
of
other
reviews
kinda
surprised
by
my
appraisal
of
it
perfect
amber
orange
pour
head
and
lacing
somewhat
poor
old
beer
many
people
wrote
of
the
hop
intensity
but
i
didnt
notice
that
much

my
notes
say
a
lite
hop
tang
with
nice
dry
aftertaste
lite
spicy
thoughout
very
good
overall
taste

will
have
to
find
it
on
tap
and
have
another
glass
or
two
the
hops
are
stinging
when
you
first
drink
the
brew
almost
as
if
the
beer
is
too
cold
and
it
is
chilling
your
tongue
there
is
a
very
smooth
creamy
and
bread
laden
malt
undertone
that
holds
up
well
the
hops
tip
the
balance
scale
on
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
profile
citric
floral
hops
finish
giving
a
slightly
acidic
and
dry
feeling
very
well
crafted
and
worth
a
few
this
beer
is
the
standard
of
all
other
apa
brews
that
have
followed
had
this
many
times
but
never
reviewed
it
here
goes
it
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
filled
with
american
hops
citrus
and
grass
not
much
else
the
flavor
has
a
nice
caramel
backing
and
then
follows
with
the
citrus
hops
this
is
a
solid
apa
nothing
wrong
at
all
drinkability
is
good
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
bottle
many
a
time
in
the
past
but
i
finally
decided
to
order
it
on
tap
at
my
favorite
bar
earlier
tonight
this
is
a
stunning
apa
out
of
the
bottle
but
out
of
the
tap
its
frickin
exceptional
it
pours
to
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
frothy
white
head
that
stays
for
most
of
the
pint
the
smell
seemed
somewhat
subdued
though
i
have
somewhat
of
a
nasal
cold
this
didnt
kill
my
judgement
however
as
i
could
still
smell
the
wonderfull
citrusyhop
smell
also
the
retroolfaction
was
actually
improved
somewhat
as
the
odors
seemed
to
get
caught
up
in
all
the
mucuous
from
the
cold
i
will
definately
be
revisiting
this
from
the
tap
wherever
available
particularly
if
there
is
nothing
new
to
try
though
the
bar
i
had
this
at
the
sanctuary
still
has
quite
an
enourmous
selection
of
beers
that
i
havent
tried
and
like
always
i
could
drink
snpa
all
night
from
tap
or
bottle
12
oz
bottle
conditioned
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
golden
orange
into
the
imperial
pint
glass
with
a
3
finger
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
and
a
thin
blanket
of
foam
couldnt
resist
pouring
the
yeast
into
the
glass
has
a
floralmetallicgrassycitrus
smell
flavors
are
a
hop
spiciness
up
front
with
a
lasting
bitterness
some
floralcitrus
notes
lemon
and
grains
with
the
malts
getting
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
along
with
a
bit
of
yeast
the
carbonation
is
crisp
at
first
but
becomes
smooth
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
pale
ale
with
a
wide
enough
distribution
that
you
can
always
rely
on
it
to
satisfy
your
hop
craving
ugghhh
sierra
nevada
makes
some
damn
fine
beers
bigfoot
is
still
my
all
time
favorite
beer
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
from
now
on
this
pours
pale
as
expected
with
a
thin
head
if
youre
light
on
the
pour
the
taste
is
a
bit
overcitrusy
for
my
tastes
and
i
much
prefer
the
sn
porter
and
stout
to
this
but
it
still
holds
its
own
the
smell
is
rather
nondescript
although
it
hints
to
the
taste
this
is
a
better
compliment
to
lighter
foods
than
the
porter
or
stout
are
and
its
the
only
sn
available
at
the
albertsons
which
is
close
to
me
the
closest
liquor
store
is
45
minutes
away
but
i
still
catch
it
on
the
way
back
from
university
so
i
keep
coming
back
to
it
a
sometimes
thin
sometimes
thick
depending
on
age
i
suspect
layer
of
sediment
dwells
on
the
bottom
due
to
bottle
conditioning
which
encourages
a
light
pour
enjoyable
but
certainly
not
the
best
sn
offering
ahh
the
classic
pale
ale
the
taste
of
this
brings
back
good
memories
this
beer
goes
so
well
with
any
meal
especially
pizza
mmm
anything
by
sierra
nevada
is
always
welcome
in
my
pint
glass
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
has
a
very
hazy
orange
color
to
it
you
can
see
the
particals
of
yeast
from
the
bottle
conditioning
the
head
is
fairly
large
and
settles
to
a
sticky
lace
around
the
glass
smells
hoppy
with
a
little
grain
bitter
spice
citrusmalts
and
pine
dominate
the
flavor
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
i
think
it
is
the
perfect
session
beer
in
my
opinion
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
truely
a
classic
american
beer
sierra
nevadas
flagship
and
a
good
one
at
that
this
should
be
the
standard
by
which
other
apas
are
judged
this
is
the
lay
of
the
land
someone
order
the
pizza
nice
golden
brew
which
while
it
has
a
dissapointing
head
the
lacing
is
quite
nice
the
smell
is
strong
and
carries
through
the
classic
ale
aromas
hops
dominating
them
all
on
tasting
the
first
impression
is
sharply
that
of
the
hops
which
slowly
blends
to
a
vanilla
creamy
sweetness
with
a
very
even
mouth
feel
the
after
taste
is
a
twang
of
sharp
hops
tempered
by
smooth
cream
all
over
a
very
drinkable
ale
the
level
of
hops
may
put
off
some
people
but
it
is
very
well
rounded
and
masterfully
crafted
a
good
beer
drinkers
beer
great
for
sharing
with
your
friends
and
a
good
introduction
to
master
crafted
ales
clear
color
is
a
light
reddishgolden
on
tap
it
seems
darker
to
me
though
the
head
is
white
and
dissipates
a
bit
rapidly
the
aroma
is
clean
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
and
a
nice
citrusy
hop
smell
the
flavor
is
crisp
clean
with
a
slightly
sweet
malty
base
followed
by
a
piney
resinous
hop
note
and
a
solid
bitterness
several
years
ago
this
was
the
hoppiest
beer
i
had
regularly
since
then
its
hoppiness
has
been
surpassed
by
others
but
i
dont
think
any
beer
is
as
well
balanced
and
compliemented
as
this
one
this
is
a
great
beer
and
delicious
half
of
my
homebrews
are
apa
style
because
i
liked
it
so
much
sn
apa
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
love
the
floral
cascade
hops
and
plenty
of
them
tasty
and
quaffable
classic
if
not
the
origional
american
pale
ale
i
seem
to
remember
liking
this
more
5
years
ago
tho
have
i
changed
or
the
beer
possibly
both
bitter
and
sweet
blend
perfectly
and
then
comes
the
somewhat
prickly
alcohol
and
a
large
bitterness
in
the
aftetaste
together
with
spicy
traces
goddamn
im
damned
impressed
with
snpa
this
time
around
for
about
the
past
two
years
ive
only
had
it
as
my
fallback
beer
when
at
restaurants
and
its
usually
been
served
way
too
cold
usually
in
one
of
those
frosted
tulippilsner
glasses
drinking
it
now
at
the
proper
temperature
so
that
i
can
actually
taste
it
its
way
more
nuanced
than
id
thought
when
ice
cold
all
that
i
was
able
to
taste
were
prominent
citrus
hops
now
that
its
warmed
up
i
can
taste
the
depth
of
bready
malt
and
the
hops
seem
to
be
in
perfect
complimenting
balance
this
beer
mustve
blow
peoples
minds
when
it
hit
the
market
back
in
the
80s
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
classic
apa
that
stands
the
taste
of
time
simple
and
solid
nothing
unique
but
still
a
great
session
brew
i
love
chico
a
fun
school
and
a
awesome
beer
this
beer
can
be
found
almost
anywhere
and
it
never
fails
to
come
correct
it
is
much
better
on
tap
on
tap
i
would
have
given
it
all
5s
lets
get
to
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
the
nose
is
complex
pretty
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
great
hoppy
and
spicy
taste
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
beer
this
beer
will
be
around
for
a
long
time
i
really
like
it
with
spicy
food
and
pizza
the
taste
was
great
very
well
balanced
with
a
good
bitterness
that
hits
you
and
then
slowly
fades
into
some
maltiness
with
a
possible
hint
of
citrus
the
smoothness
and
body
of
this
beer
is
incredible
and
it
has
a
very
light
carbonation
all
making
for
a
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
for
hours
this
beer
poured
a
dark
gold
amber
into
the
glass
leaving
a
decentsized
head
it
smelled
hoppy
but
it
wasnt
totally
overpowering
the
taste
was
smooth
and
crisp
leaving
a
slight
aftertaste
that
disappeared
quickly
after
the
initial
hop
hit
on
the
tongue
subsequent
sips
proved
pretty
refreshing
it
felt
somewhat
bitter
on
my
tongue
but
the
bitterness
contributed
to
the
compexity
of
the
flavors
i
was
tasting
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
many
of
these
in
succession
but
this
was
a
good
dinner
beer
i
had
it
with
somewhat
spicy
food
and
it
went
pretty
well
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
it
with
salads
or
other
types
of
entrees
very
fresh
tasting
but
with
a
disappointingly
onedimensional
flavor
profile
lots
of
tasty
grapefruit
hop
flavor
but
no
malts
or
additional
complexity
in
sight
this
sample
just
didnt
measure
up
to
the
bottled
versions
ive
had
big
white
head
with
good
retention
leaves
me
with
strong
lace
the
light
with
a
mix
of
grain
and
hops
mmmm
balance
i
like
balance
in
my
pale
ales
expecially
in
something
i
will
be
drinking
alot
of
which
this
one
is
good
for
easy
on
the
carbonation
and
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
final
thought
its
been
over
two
years
since
i
drank
a
snpa
but
i
am
glad
i
refounded
this
relationship
that
will
continue
for
quite
some
time
this
nice
beer
pours
a
copper
colour
with
a
not
so
big
head
the
head
reduces
slowly
leaving
just
a
ring
of
foam
it
has
a
fruity
and
hoppy
smell
with
some
hints
of
malt
quite
strong
in
carbonation
but
it
is
balanced
the
taste
is
malty
and
smooth
and
you
can
feel
lots
of
fruity
hops
in
the
aftertaste
you
also
get
alot
of
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
a
really
nice
pale
ale
that
i
also
have
tasted
on
tap
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
american
pale
ales
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
one
of
the
best
massmarket
beers
out
there
and
can
please
beer
geeks
and
beer
newbies
drinkability
fairly
cheap
and
widely
available
a
staple
of
the
apa
style
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
have
ontap
in
the
area
since
most
of
them
have
it
you
could
drink
this
all
night
long
if
you
wanted
to
and
youd
enjoy
it
a
nice
micro
pale
ale
from
a
notsomicro
american
brewer
on
the
whole
one
may
call
this
a
nice
beer
notes
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
its
the
beer
that
brought
me
into
the
realm
of
beer
advocacy
this
is
the
gateway
drug
of
good
beer
furthermore
its
an
incredible
fallback
beer
if
youre
at
a
a
moderate
to
nice
bar
in
california
chances
are
they
have
this
beer
in
bottles
so
even
if
they
fail
to
have
anything
incredible
you
can
usually
get
this
beer
its
akin
to
having
to
drive
your
cadillac
while
your
mercedes
is
in
the
shop
this
is
a
great
fallback
here
where
i
live
it
can
be
found
no
matter
where
you
are
this
beer
was
my
first
introduction
to
hops
drinkability
for
some
reason
i
get
worn
out
on
this
beer
when
i
drink
it
too
often
for
me
its
maybe
a
12
pack
a
year
a
great
pale
ale
but
one
to
be
consumed
only
on
occasion
for
me
a
good
pick
though
while
it
doesnt
live
up
to
expectations
this
beer
will
always
hold
a
special
place
with
me
and
warrant
the
occasional
purchase
its
decently
balanced
and
a
good
transition
to
the
wonderful
world
of
american
pale
ales
although
i
dont
live
there
now
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
beer
i
lived
in
northern
california
i
have
to
wonder
if
freshness
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
perceived
dropoff
in
quality
in
this
review
beer
pours
a
light
amber
that
is
something
slightly
less
than
brillantly
clear
white
head
sits
on
top
smell
is
of
citrusy
hops
taste
of
beer
is
of
cascade
hops
with
a
slight
malt
background
finish
is
all
hops
slight
hint
of
mineraly
water
very
drinkable
and
smooth
beer
with
a
nice
body
definatley
a
session
beer
great
beer
although
i
have
to
admit
i
expected
a
little
more
when
i
heard
this
was
the
prototypical
apa
i
guess
i
was
expected
the
best
apa
ever
but
ive
had
a
few
i
liked
better
taste
is
nicely
hopped
very
full
and
complete
citric
hop
tastes
finish
the
sip
appropriately
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
slow
sipping
at
a
bar
or
at
home
thankfully
this
is
available
almost
everywhere
i
have
nothing
more
to
add
that
hasnt
been
said
numerous
times
already
it
has
a
pleasant
hoppyfruitymalty
aroma
that
screams
drink
me
its
flavor
is
very
much
balanced
between
a
hoppy
bite
and
a
malty
sweetness
if
a
bit
thin
for
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
finish
that
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
it
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
a
highly
drinkable
pale
at
5
6
abv
a
safety
beer
you
can
find
everywhere
and
drink
all
night
never
a
let
down
drinkability
is
nice
but
ive
never
gone
totally
nuts
for
it
quenches
thirst
very
well
and
takes
the
edge
off
if
i
need
a
good
hop
fix
though
overall
a
nice
beer
that
is
a
good
fallback
for
me
if
i
cant
find
anything
else
sampled
at
the
sophisticated
otter
in
johnson
city
tn
my
snpa
came
out
a
clear
slightly
reddish
gold
under
a
very
thin
white
head
that
lingered
well
and
left
very
good
lace
subdued
flowery
hops
greet
the
nose
while
the
mouth
is
met
by
a
very
pricky
mediumbodied
sensation
smooth
malt
contends
with
distinctive
flowery
hoppiness
right
from
the
start
with
the
hops
winning
out
in
the
end
theres
a
very
nice
bite
in
the
finish
followed
by
a
good
lingering
bitterness
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
a
solid
standby
brew
cant
go
wrong
here
very
nicely
done
tastes
just
as
good
today
as
it
did
some
twenty
plus
years
ago
think
about
it
you
hopheads
are
spoiled
and
your
tastebuds
are
burned
out
snpa
is
the
king
of
pale
ales
if
you
want
to
convert
a
macro
drinker
start
here
taste
is
very
nice
crisp
and
clean
with
a
mix
of
some
fruity
maltiness
followed
by
a
very
nice
classic
hoppiness
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
has
excellent
drinkability
a
classic
that
still
taste
as
good
now
as
the
first
time
i
ever
had
it
overall
a
great
pale
ale
this
is
a
solid
beer
actually
it
seems
to
serve
sometimes
as
a
crossover
beer
its
widely
available
a
lot
of
people
know
about
it
but
yet
its
very
good
unlike
a
lot
of
popular
brews
appears
a
vibrant
orangy
amber
color
with
a
typical
head
and
lacing
for
a
pale
ale
fruity
hops
abound
in
the
nose
taste
is
of
course
hoppy
which
is
good
a
bit
citrusy
and
tangy
but
what
makes
this
beer
great
is
that
theres
an
excellent
balance
of
sweet
malts
in
there
as
well
feels
smooth
and
creamy
a
supereasy
beer
to
drink
bueno
taste
was
citrus
tangy
and
reminiscent
of
mangos
very
sweet
but
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
left
an
astringent
feel
on
the
palate
in
a
good
way
very
tasty
a
classic
apa
finishes
dry
smooth
moderate
mouthfeel
quaffable
as
hell
edit
im
downgrading
this
one
to
all
4s
not
because
its
not
a
good
beer
but
because
theres
a
specific
taste
in
there
that
i
dont
quite
like
perhaps
its
metallic
but
it
detracts
a
bit
from
the
overall
drinkability
the
color
is
a
nice
amber
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
stays
for
awhile
and
leaves
good
lacing
down
the
glass
light
hop
smell
bitter
yet
offset
well
by
the
malts
a
smooth
citrusy
taste
thats
well
balanced
and
refreshing
yeah
it
doesnt
pack
a
lot
of
punch
but
its
not
supposed
to
you
could
certainly
argue
that
its
not
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
but
its
still
a
really
good
really
drinkable
beer
especially
since
you
can
find
one
just
about
anywhere
these
days
considering
that
the
default
tap
at
many
bars
is
budweiser
or
coors
thank
god
much
different
than
i
remember
and
different
than
what
i
had
ontap
at
sierra
nevada
brewery
this
is
the
3rd
bottle
that
has
tasted
this
way
ill
chalk
it
up
to
a
more
refined
palate
but
this
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
anymore
considered
a
classic
american
pale
ale
in
many
circles
way
to
bready
and
cheesy
i
would
pick
nearly
any
pale
ale
over
this
boston
ale
is
a
much
better
massproduced
alternative
if
you
have
to
drink
this
drink
it
icecold
it
gets
nasty
warm
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
an
excellent
smell
i
drank
one
with
a
steak
on
saturday
night
and
the
combination
was
awsome
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
well
worth
the
money
some
of
my
other
recomendations
for
ales
try
redhooks
ipa
or
summit
epa
clear
orange
amber
with
beautiful
lucious
foamy
yellowtan
head
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
and
bready
malt
very
nice
array
of
interchanging
flavors
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
with
a
bitter
and
nutty
aftertaste
wonderful
malt
backing
a
nice
quality
like
other
sierra
nevada
beers
ive
had
medium
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
i
had
a
few
of
these
very
nice
brew
this
was
a
great
pale
ale
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
had
it
straight
off
the
tap
in
a
pint
glass
had
a
little
bit
of
an
amberish
color
to
it
although
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
it
tastes
very
similar
to
the
rock
bottom
brewerys
potomac
pale
ale
my
last
review
sierra
nevada
however
is
definitely
in
my
top
five
of
favorite
pale
ales
poured
a
light
amber
clear
color
with
a
continuous
stream
of
bubbles
seemingly
feeding
a
tiny
creamy
white
head
nose
is
citrus
and
cascase
with
a
sour
grainy
thing
happening
taste
is
citrus
up
front
tangy
and
slightly
fruity
in
the
middle
bitter
and
dry
for
the
finish
very
balanced
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
medium
to
light
great
stuff
from
a
big
producer
the
classic
american
pale
ale
the
flavor
has
a
mild
sweet
malt
profile
with
touches
of
cascade
hops
a
soft
nuttiness
is
also
present
but
not
in
an
overpowering
or
oily
fashion
the
beer
is
smooth
and
certainly
suitable
as
a
daily
drinker
served
at
infields
chicago
loop
good
to
see
this
stylesetting
beer
at
more
places
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
pours
an
appealing
amber
body
under
a
thin
pale
ale
head
originally
had
a
mild
taste
but
i
felt
that
i
was
tasting
the
glass
more
maybe
it
wasnt
rinsed
correctly
but
the
fine
balance
of
hop
and
malt
came
through
definite
northwestern
hop
profile
with
spice
bitterness
and
a
light
fruity
touch
a
good
toasty
malt
blend
thats
just
a
little
sticky
on
the
palate
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
and
a
little
alcohol
warmth
to
enjoy
afterward
not
extreme
by
any
means
but
an
excellent
session
beer
well
i
finally
got
around
to
this
american
classic
it
wasnt
bad
it
wasnt
great
above
par
in
every
category
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
cant
really
say
anything
about
this
that
hasnt
been
said
before
good
for
the
style
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
must
try
for
any
connoisseur
of
the
cold
ones
it
poured
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
it
smelled
of
hops
and
malt
its
taste
was
clean
and
sharp
with
a
malt
start
and
a
hop
finish
it
was
light
and
dry
in
the
mouth
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
ill
be
searching
for
this
is
a
standard
nowadays
a
true
american
beer
and
style
to
boot
this
baby
is
dangerously
drinkable
make
sure
you
pick
up
enough
to
satisfy
your
thirst
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
this
is
the
best
apa
around
and
quite
honestly
my
favorite
domestic
beer
pours
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
smells
of
those
wonderful
cascade
hops
how
i
love
them
the
taste
is
smooth
and
hoppy
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
any
day
for
that
matter
this
is
what
beer
should
be
one
of
the
first
nonmacro
american
beers
i
ever
had
back
years
ago
its
been
over
a
year
since
i
last
had
this
one
so
lets
see
where
this
takes
us
the
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
about
one
finger
of
head
that
falls
quickly
the
nose
is
hops
and
more
hops
just
what
i
want
in
a
good
apa
theres
some
floral
and
some
citrus
in
the
hop
character
it
just
comes
together
and
smells
good
i
guess
i
have
come
along
since
i
last
sampled
this
beer
the
hop
character
is
nicely
balanced
with
sweet
malts
just
a
good
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
hop
carry
through
in
the
flavor
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
the
beer
is
not
too
thick
or
too
thin
in
my
mouth
nice
all
around
this
is
an
easy
session
beer
im
glad
i
revisited
it
after
taking
some
time
off
from
it
just
a
good
offering
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
with
subtle
carbonation
thanks
to
the
bottle
conditioning
i
suppose
this
beer
is
excessively
drinkable
and
as
good
as
i
imagined
thank
god
they
sell
it
in
western
canada
this
one
came
served
to
me
from
the
bar
in
a
mason
jar
yep
ah
well
its
a
treat
to
find
some
halfway
decent
draught
offerings
in
my
little
town
filled
to
the
brim
of
a
16oz
mason
jar
so
not
much
head
to
speak
of
although
there
is
a
sturdy
layer
of
foam
on
top
of
the
rubyhued
amber
body
the
scent
was
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
with
a
hefty
dollop
of
cascade
hops
piney
and
grapefruit
the
taste
was
really
nice
seemed
to
be
really
fresh
resinous
hops
with
enough
malt
presence
to
back
it
adequately
mouthfeel
was
about
mediumlight
and
makes
the
beer
really
refreshing
this
beer
had
more
hop
presence
than
a
local
ipa
i
was
having
afterwards
so
i
ended
up
returning
to
it
when
i
had
it
this
time
it
just
really
seemed
to
be
pushing
pale
ale
into
ipa
territory
delicious
and
as
ever
a
real
goto
beer
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
started
on
my
quest
for
better
beer
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
its
only
fitting
that
it
would
be
my
first
one
to
review
i
just
bought
a
sixer
of
this
poured
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
thick
lighttan
head
with
alot
of
rising
bubbles
malts
and
hops
with
some
lemon
are
very
noticable
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
with
strong
hops
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
strong
and
malty
coating
the
tongue
with
its
hoppy
aftertaste
i
will
definately
buy
this
beer
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
pale
ale
other
than
that
its
really
nothing
special
nice
hops
but
not
fantastic
not
something
to
go
for
if
youre
looking
for
the
unique
brew
its
good
but
nothing
spectacular
pours
a
golden
amber
colored
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
cascade
hop
aroma
and
some
muted
caramelly
malt
notes
too
not
particularly
bad
in
any
sense
but
nothing
to
email
home
about
either
i
feel
this
brew
shines
in
its
drinkability
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
beer
and
maybe
im
being
a
little
sentimental
but
its
good
its
good
so
revisit
some
old
standbys
every
now
and
then
good
carbonation
lacking
a
bit
in
malt
complexity
and
thin
in
the
middle
but
cascades
are
good
16oz
pint
glass
presentation
hardly
a
head
but
what
was
present
was
a
white
film
over
a
dark
amber
brew
with
no
lacing
light
pale
malt
aroma
coupled
with
a
bit
of
hops
with
the
flavor
carrying
on
where
the
nose
left
off
and
an
overall
acceptable
feel
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
excellent
drinkability
wellbalanced
means
easy
to
drink
frequently
slightly
hazed
orange
with
a
off
white
to
beige
head
capping
off
the
top
malt
crisp
citrus
and
hops
bleed
aroma
into
the
nose
with
refreshing
ease
malt
hits
the
tastebuds
first
but
are
doomed
to
a
quick
end
by
the
tidal
of
hops
caramel
soon
joins
and
smooths
out
the
rest
of
the
drink
very
nicely
balanced
the
entire
drink
shalaqs
the
mouth
with
great
malt
and
hops
ill
have
this
again
overall
im
not
too
impressed
i
was
expecting
more
fruity
notes
to
balance
the
bitterness
i
can
respect
what
this
beer
has
done
for
the
microbrewery
business
but
ive
never
been
able
to
get
into
it
pours
out
a
ambercopper
color
with
a
pretty
decent
offwhite
head
strong
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
and
much
better
than
average
head
retention
put
this
beer
among
the
top
smell
is
a
category
i
always
struggle
with
having
said
that
i
do
detect
some
hops
and
citrus
notes
possibly
some
malt
in
there
as
well
overall
a
pleasant
smell
taste
is
well
above
average
strong
hop
bitterness
balanced
by
a
sweet
maltiness
and
some
citrus
flavors
though
not
overly
complex
i
feel
this
is
still
a
very
delicate
balance
that
makes
it
a
very
good
beer
true
to
the
style
it
finishes
with
strong
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
well
light
and
crisp
without
being
over
carbonated
or
too
thin
i
consider
this
a
very
strong
offering
worthy
of
a
special
occasion
or
everyday
consumption
alike
definitely
a
beer
that
any
craft
beer
lover
should
try
maybe
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
was
recently
converted
from
macros
but
i
wouldnt
make
this
one
part
of
such
a
program
too
early
due
to
the
bitterness
very
drinkable
nice
balanced
hoppy
pale
ale
the
beer
disembogues
the
stubby
brown
12ounce
bottle
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
the
head
portly
and
off
white
in
color
with
the
left
over
lace
a
fine
velum
like
sheet
that
obscures
the
glass
oh
what
a
wonderful
nose
malt
citrus
crisp
hop
floral
and
just
plain
sniffable
with
the
start
rich
in
malt
and
somewhat
sweet
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
determined
acidity
the
hops
wonderfully
spicy
and
the
aftertaste
desert
bone
dry
sorry
old
friend
if
i
have
ignored
you
lately
it
was
not
intentional
overall
definitely
solid
beer
this
one
has
long
been
one
of
my
mainstay
beers
i
can
find
it
almost
anywhere
i
go
and
pretty
cheaply
at
that
furthermore
its
a
great
session
brew
i
can
and
have
had
many
of
these
throughout
the
night
and
i
often
feel
like
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
it
this
was
truly
the
brew
that
got
me
started
on
good
craft
beer
and
to
this
day
its
still
a
favorite
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
about
an
inch
thick
aromas
are
of
citrus
and
bitter
hops
with
a
bit
of
doughy
bread
malt
for
flavor
this
beer
has
it
all
initially
this
beer
shows
off
a
barrage
of
hops
some
citrusy
some
piney
a
just
a
little
that
provide
some
nice
bitterness
somewhere
in
between
all
of
it
some
bread
and
dough
like
malts
sneak
their
way
in
to
provide
a
perfect
balance
but
just
as
the
malts
appear
the
hops
come
back
into
the
picture
to
finish
this
beer
in
perfect
pale
ale
fashion
leaving
just
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
make
you
crave
another
sip
the
body
of
this
beer
is
nice
and
light
with
a
crisp
carbonation
very
well
balanced
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
tried
several
other
sierra
nevada
products
this
day
and
this
by
far
the
best
one
not
heavy
but
not
light
just
right
i
bought
a
six
pack
to
acquire
a
taste
and
ended
up
forking
out
120
to
put
on
a
half
highly
recommended
pours
a
deep
but
clear
and
consistent
golden
brown
aroma
is
pleasant
with
slight
flowery
undertones
taste
is
clean
but
not
without
flavor
and
the
hops
are
generous
but
not
overpowering
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
producing
a
round
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
a
clear
example
of
a
classic
pale
ale
without
overreaching
in
complexity
after
a
break
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
quite
a
bit
lately
and
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
with
it
all
over
again
its
a
classic
in
the
light
caramel
citrusy
hops
vein
but
what
i
am
struck
with
is
just
how
elegant
this
beer
has
become
residual
sweetness
bitterness
malt
and
hops
in
the
nose
its
all
in
perfect
proportion
this
is
a
real
quality
apa
this
is
a
definite
beer
to
pick
up
again
wonderful
pale
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
one
i
wasnt
surprised
when
consumer
reports
rated
it
the
best
overall
beer
based
on
taste
and
cost
of
course
since
they
couldnt
review
every
beer
out
there
people
might
not
agree
but
they
arent
way
off
base
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
with
strong
hop
flavor
but
none
of
the
disagreeable
bitterness
and
overpined
flavor
of
some
pale
ales
drinkability
excessively
so
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
this
is
known
as
the
epitome
of
an
american
pale
ale
as
well
it
should
it
has
a
nice
appearance
in
the
glass
with
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
color
the
lace
sticks
around
until
i
finish
the
beer
the
smell
is
citrusy
and
so
is
the
taste
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
hopiness
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
citrus
flavor
this
is
overall
a
very
versatile
beer
it
is
great
in
the
summer
and
the
winter
it
is
great
with
or
without
food
it
is
without
a
doubt
a
pleasure
to
drink
there
is
a
real
nice
crisp
and
clean
character
to
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
i
expected
more
from
this
pale
ale
perhaps
it
was
the
batch
that
was
the
problem
pours
light
amber
smells
a
lot
of
hops
and
alcohol
kinda
skunky
tastes
rather
bitter
with
a
generous
portion
of
hops
alcohol
and
skunk
that
stays
with
your
tongue
until
your
next
sip
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
this
is
a
wonder
beer
that
is
available
all
over
frequently
quite
cheaply
i
got
my
current
12pk
for
7
99
came
in
a
pint
glass
a
nice
golden
color
blend
in
with
some
amber
tones
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
wished
there
was
more
carbonation
in
this
beer
but
it
had
to
do
smell
was
quite
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
some
citrus
undertones
with
some
grain
in
the
background
were
there
as
well
taste
was
mostly
hops
as
well
some
undertones
of
malts
can
be
tasted
as
well
in
the
middle
and
into
the
aftertaste
finally
i
know
what
the
fuss
is
about
for
this
beer
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
out
there
espeically
ontap
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
reviewed
this
beer
yet
as
i
have
had
it
many
times
what
makes
this
a
touchstone
among
so
many
beerlovers
it
is
the
blend
between
easy
drinking
and
hoppy
complexity
this
beer
has
lots
of
interesting
nuances
for
the
sipper
but
goes
well
with
food
and
mowing
the
grass
along
with
liberty
ale
by
anchor
steam
this
beer
helped
define
the
american
pale
ale
what
also
is
a
bonus
is
the
availibility
of
this
beer
even
in
gas
stations
and
supermarkets
considering
how
often
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
ive
upgraded
the
drinkability
score
significantly
as
well
as
the
mouthfeel
those
fine
bubbles
are
very
lagerlike
and
do
a
good
job
of
refreshing
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
pours
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
good
lacings
throughout
smells
light
fresh
and
a
little
hoppy
a
hint
of
alcohol
of
you
really
get
your
schnozz
in
there
and
sniff
pretty
bland
tasting
i
think
but
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
citrusy
sweetness
its
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
great
for
a
cookout
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
good
session
beer
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
unless
they
punch
me
in
the
face
which
i
guess
is
not
the
definition
of
pale
ales
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
brew
to
all
as
the
nose
indicated
this
is
mostly
hops
nice
and
fresh
strong
floralherbal
quality
but
malts
are
there
very
well
balanced
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
easy
to
see
why
this
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
gateway
beer
into
craft
beverages
i
gave
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
a
4
0
because
lets
face
it
this
is
the
staple
of
craft
beers
chances
are
this
is
where
you
started
when
it
all
began
the
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
amber
the
head
is
a
sight
to
see
ivory
white
and
the
lacing
is
impecable
the
smell
is
that
of
a
nice
spring
air
fresh
cascade
hops
with
slight
caramel
hints
a
citrusfloral
that
brings
character
the
taste
is
a
orchestrated
mix
of
malt
sweetness
and
fruit
aftertones
the
hop
bitterness
is
just
enough
to
appreciate
the
sweetness
hints
of
lemonorange
zest
and
fresh
rasberries
linger
in
the
buds
the
roasted
malt
will
show
its
power
in
the
end
this
is
a
medium
bodied
pale
ale
and
has
that
nice
crisp
but
smooth
refreshing
flavor
you
need
in
a
nice
pale
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
you
can
have
a
12
pack
a
day
of
these
yes
they
are
that
good
snpa
is
like
the
don
corleone
of
beers
it
is
the
godfather
alot
of
people
are
starting
to
put
down
sn
because
they
are
becoming
too
big
with
a
big
hit
of
cascade
hops
even
though
this
is
a
wellhopped

forgotten
what

beer
it
really
is
the
beer
poured
a
deep
golden
with
a
firm
tan
head
the
head
faded
fast
and
is
probably
the
least
impressive
aspect
of
this
beer
the
aroma
of
hops
comes
through
but
with
each
sip
the
smell
of
the
malt
gets
stronger
what
a
joy
the
hops
on
the
tongue
are
not
overpowering
and
the
chocolaty
which
hints
of
the
hops
and
malt
contained
within
the
taste
is
nice
on
both
the
palate
and

both

it

the

that
this

a

a
definite
plus
in
my
scorebook
a
strong
hop
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
classic
citrusy
scents
of
american
hop
varieties
the

flavors
in
the
beer
are
more
subtle
slightly
citrusy
its
path
having
been
laid
by
the
popularity
of
the

have
a

nothing

this
is
quite

the
hop
levels
are
subdued
for
a
pale

but
rather
well
balanced
with
a

sweetness
and
the

i
guess
i
need
to
brush
up
on
my
beer
nomenclature
i
thought
i
knew
what
a
pale
ale
was
but
obviously
im
out
of
sync
this
being
in
the
english
style
is
pushing
my
low
hoppiness
tolerance
its
bearable
but
a
suffrage
since
rnh
offers
sipping
i
should
have
looked
before
i
leapt
found
myself
neck
deep
in
what
might
be
the
longest
pint
of
my
life
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
orange
color
with
a
3
finger
high
white
head
when
poured
into
a
stemmed
beer
tasting
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
funky
the
beer
is
an
excellent
blend
of
hops
and
malt
very
piny
bitter
on
the
finish
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
poured
a
copperamber
with
a
modest
head
and
decent
lace
retention
for
me
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
malt
grain
and
a
tiny
hint
of
honey
the
taste
was
a
bit
surprising
for
me
in
that
it
features
a
heavier
than
normal
emphasis
on
hops
as
compared
to
other
pale
ales
ive
had
indeed
the
slightly
intense
citric
grapefruit
hop
taste
and
dry
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
remind
me
more
of
an
ipa
that
i
did
not
detect
as
much
of
a
malt
backbone
or
sweet
flavor
to
balance
out
the
hops
is
the
only
minor
quibble
i
have
with
this
one
no
complaints
about
feel
lively
carbonation
is
crisp
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
a
solid
brew
o
goes
down
easily
overall
more
malty
than
a
typical
american
pale
ale
but
more
american
hop
flavoraroma
than
a
british
pale
ale
so
the
overall
impression
is
a
cross
between
an
english
and
american
pale
ale
nicely
done
bought
in
dublin
ireland
not
overly
fond
of
this
beer
lacking
in
bodymouthfeel
for
me
with
nothing
that
would
drive
me
back
for
another
nice
hoppy
flavor
well
rounded
taste
bottle
i
remember
one
session
when
i
was
captivated
now
it
seems
a
little
too
heavily
malted
the
carbonation
at
the
end
distracting
and
the
aftertaste
is
metallic
overall
great
look
great
flavor
if
it
had
even
the
slightest
bit
more
carbonation
in
would
have
ranked
higher
for
me

in
all

than
i
was
expecting
from
a

is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
malty
introduction
and
the
hops
take
over
in
a
drying
way
medium
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
but
never
reaches
the
level
of
wow
at
any
point
i
prefer
a
brighter
and
hoppier
apathis
one
uses
the
heavy
hand
on
the
malt
for

taste

subtle
flavor
was
a
pretty
standard
pale

well

but
also
kind
of
boring
flavor
wise
o
a

seems
more
english
at
first
but
the
bitterness
from

becomes
more
prominent
later

ok
i
guess
if
theres
nothing
else
around
to
drink
this
is
not
my
idea
of
a
pale
ale
first
of
all
its
fizzy
if
i
want
fizzy
i
will
drink
a
coke
thank
you
fizzy
really
is
a
turnoff
in
craft
brews
this
ale
is
grossly
overrated
by
this
site
so
far
overall
a
good
beer
not
something
that
wowed
me
o
overall
a
good
brew
id
definitely
have
another
one
o
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
while
still
be
a
touch
more
flavorful
than
other
apas
certainly
this
one
was
well
ahead
of
its
time
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
o
a
drinkable
pale
ale
that
has
a
decent
amount
of
character
there
is
a
nice
grapefruit
punch
up
front
followed
by
round
full
malt
backbone
that
coats
the
mouth
and
lands
in
the
back
a
very
solid
pale
ale
with
a
nice
play
of
citrus
hops
and
bread
malt
notes
best
pale
ale
ive
had
yet
quite
possibly
o
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
with
a
near
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
o
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
smuttynose
amazes
me
time

time
again
with
their
ability
to
brew
every
beer
to

i
have

liquid
brewed
by
smuttynose
that
i
do
not
enjoy
the
overall
packaging
of
their
brews
are
very
attractive
and
keep
me
wanting
to
try
all
of
their
creations
o
a
tasty
and
wellmade
pale
ale
that
hits
all
the
points
you
want

shoals
pale

taste
is

a
superb
pale

thats

wellhopped
and
better
than
many
ipas
out
there
id
easily
pick
this
up

o
another
good
brew
from
smuttynose
i
think
they
are
climbing
up
my
list
a
def
top
5
brewery
that
i
will
try
any
beer
from
overall
a
refreshing
pale
ale
that
is
a
solid
goto
on
a
summer
day
o
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
nothing
crazy
but
well
above
average
id
drink
this
again
drinkaility
this
is
one
that
ill
enjoy
drinking
but
i
just
have
had
too
many
others
that
id
prefer
over
this
one
founders
for
one
sierra
nevada
or
oskar
blues
are
all
apas
that
id
do
again
before
i
come
back
to
this
beer
to
me
this
beer
is
like
stone
pale
ale
its
good
and
ill
come
back
to
it
but
id
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
o
a
balanced
pale
ale
that
leaves
nothing
to
the
imagination
very
straightforward
brewing
if
i
wanted
a
sixpack
of
something
from
smuttynose
it
would
definitely
be
finestkind
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
tasty
lawnmower
beer
ill
file
this
under

hot
days
only
lighter
medium

slightly

crisp

fairly

hops

resiny
theres
a
kind
of
salty
taste
as
well
lingers
dry
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
and
a
bitter
mouth
coating
this
is
a
heavy
and
full
bodied
pale
ale
whose
bitterness
is
not
for
the
weak
drinks
more
and
more
bitter
i
actually
gave
up
this
is
one
of
better
pale
ales
i
have
tasted
usually
pale
ales
can
be
lackluster
in
their
aroma
and
taste
and
the
finish
is
usually
too
carbonated
in
this
ale
there
is
a
balance
of
hops
malt
fruit
and
crispness
o
overall
a
good
not
great
beer
this
is
a
nice
choice
if
you
like
hops
but
not
the
sometimes
overwhelming
hoppy
bitterness
that
some
pale
ales
have
or
for
someone
trying
a
pale
ale
for
the
first
time
everything
from
smuttynose
is
a
must
try
and
could
become
a
fave
for
you

more
as

this
beer
is
light

its
retains
a
slight
foamy
head
all
the
way
down
to
the
last
sip
it
also
leaves
nice
legs
down
the
side
of
the
glass
maybe
a
wine
term
but
what
ever
the
beer
leaves
a
warm
toasty
feel
in
your
head
and
down
the
back
of
your
neck
i
think
an
excellent
blend
of
good
brewery
craftsmanship
coupled
with
a
consistent
taste
from
every
bottle
oddly
enough
i
have
had
to
specifically
ask
my
local
grocer
to
stock
this
beer
i
asked
the
folks
at
smuttynose
to
help
and
they
went
to
work
and
got
me
in
touch
with
the
local
distributor
who
in
turn
made
sure
my
grocer
had
a

all

pale
ale
is
a
true
go
to
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
as
long
as
you
have

than
expected
for
the
style
hit
of
acidity
on

finishes
dry
with
a
faint

very
nicely

and

than
the
typical

clear

with
a
small
white

that
sank
to
a
ringlet
decent
aroma
good
balance
of
citrusy

basic
and

smell
and
taste
on
the
palate
sweet
malts
crisp
citrus
hops
toasted
grains
not
much
else
to
say
lightmedium
body
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
a
fairly
bitter
brew
with
enough
malt
to
bridge
the
gap
between
initial
hop
fruitiness
and
final
bitterness
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
and
the
flavoring
hops
are
kind
of
fleeting
othis
is
pretty
good
first
beer
ive
had
by
smuttynose
and
its
pretty
good
nothing
exceptional
but
still
good
balanced
as
it
could
possibly
be
lots
of
movement
from
grapefruit
and
tangerine
to
increasing
dryness
with
big
pine
notes
ultra
dry
and
piney
finish
tastes
outstanding
but
could
become
a
bit
much
if
you
are
planning
on
sessioning
solid
pale
ale
english
or
american
thats
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
slightly
different
take
on
an
american
pale
ale
thanks
to
the
oak
aspect
but
a
good
one
to
say
the
least
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
see
it
a
good
interputation
of
the
style
but
not
smooth
and
soft
as
one
might
find
in
an
english
ipa
mf
is
very
mediumlight
quaffable
a
clean
nice
bitterness
a
solid
brew
notes
hands
down
the
best
new
to
me
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
stunner
balanced
drinkable
tasty
this
rivals
many
brewed
in
england
ales
and
will
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
o
a
wellmade
balanced
tasty
apa
that
is
now
my
goto
for
the
style
in
new
england
unless
im
in
the
mood
for
hops
thatll
be
maine
beers
mo
interesting
pale
ale
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
over
other
smuttynose
stuff
but
certainly
quite
drinkable
and
worth
having
again
o
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
seems
to
fit
much
more
into
the
english
style
than
american
plenty
of
flavor
and
balance
to
keep
wanting
to
drink
more
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
pretty
great
more
flavor
and
complexity
than
i
was
expecting
a
few
of
these
would
make
for
a
good
night
o
only
have
one
and
enjoyed
it
i
would
try
it
again
first
brew
by
smuttynose
will
also
make
me
look
there
way
if
i
see
another
style
i
like
stoutish
o
once
again
this
beer
doesnt
come
across
as
a
pale
ale
at
all
its
much
better
such
a
good
5

overall
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
that
has
been
in
my
fridge
many
times
and
will
be
there
many
more
pretty
unsurprising
apa
but
very
well
done
i
will
have
to
pick
more
of
this
up
it
makes
for
a
very
good
summer
pour
o
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
sessionable
beer
nothing
really
exciting
as
far
as
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
go
but
just
a
pretty
solid
beer
id
like
to
see
more
hops
from
a
pale
ale
but
theyre
definitely
still
there
as
i
said
before
great
session
beer
o
very
good
apa
good
clean
crisp
beer
really
like
it
nothing
bad
to
say
o
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
even
if
it
did
expire
i
would
have
this
again
o
overall
decent
pale
ale
a
bit
too
malt
forward
and
toasty
but
to
be
fair
this
one
is
a
bit
too
aged
will
try
again
fresh
and
revisit
almost
more
brown
or
marzen
then
pale
ale
with
all
these
malts
missing
the
hop
that
i
expect
from
a
pale
ale
good
brew
very
enjoyablesessionable
in
some
aspects
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
amber
ale
definitely
a
standby
pale
ale
for
me
i
appreciate
the
balance
and
that
its
not
a
hop
bomb
while
still
producing
some
nice
varying
hop
flavor
easy
drinking
tasty
good
price
great
6pack
purchase
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
could
easily
become
a
staple
beer
in
my
household
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
o
enjoyed
this
one
very
drinkable
grassy
bitterness
but
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
make
it
interesting
would
definitely
drink
again
o
this
is
a
very
solid
pale
ale
and
should
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
this
is
a
decent
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
fruity
notes
cherries
and
dark
fruits
that
one
usually
doesnt
find
in
this
style
its
good
but
honestly
id
go
for
a
different
apa
if
given
a
choice
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
copper
amber
tone
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
flowery
hops
but
not
that
strong
and
it
is
not
as
prevalent
of
other
pale
ales
tastes
of
sweet
hops
and
light
malt
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
but
enough
hops
to
have
some
great
taste
beer
is
carbonated
rightly
and
beer
is
balanced
for
a
pale
ale
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
decent
pale
ale
o
this
beer
is
packed
with
lots
of
malty
and
hoppy
flavors
but
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
also
very
sessionable
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
still
a
little
light
as
far
as
overall
impact
o
a
fine
pale
ale
although
there
is
nothing
really
distinct
about
it
this
is
more
malt
forward
than
other
pale
ales
ive
tried
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
it
has
high
drinkability
and
a
good
flavor
i
tried
this
beer
in
early
2008
and
it
was
a
drain
pour
in
2011
i
finally
tried
it
again
while
i
did
finish
the
beer
i
still
taste
too
much
grass
and
salt
i
dont
understand
it
as
i
really
have
enjoyed
everything
else
i
have
had
from
smutty
another
pretty
solid
brew
from
smuttynose
copper
color
pour
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
powerful
citrus
character
in
the
aroma
with
grapefruit
being
very
present
taste
is
very
similar
citrus
with
malt
and
bitterness
coming
through
a
very
nice
pale
ale
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
bone
white
head
that
displays
great
retention
and
lace
smells
of

earth

and
a
hint
of

up

with
a
hint
of

from
the
hops
cut
through
the
sweetness
nicely
medium
body
with

amount
of
carbonation
and
a
resinous
mineral
water
mouthfeel
very
nicely
balanced
english
style
pale
ale
great
for
what
it
is
but
boring
to
the
palette
ive
been
working
on
wrecking
for
the
last
few
years
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
apa
good
flavor
without
too
much
alcohol
notes
gives
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
a
real
run
for
its
money
and
i
really
cant
say
enough
about
that
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
that
is
very
drinkable
solid
apa
for
sure
overall
solid
pale
ale
would
get
this
again
o
good
stuff
i
was
surprised
to
see
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
before
and
now
im
disappointed
that
i
hadnt
93
a
great
pale
ale
so
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
overall
i
think
this
pale
is
a
little
maltier
than
it
needs
to
be
dial
that
back
a
bit
and
let
that
citrus
really
take
over
meh
i
feel
awfully
nit
picky
what
a
great
pale
it
isnt
quite
a
clear
but
looks
good
in
the
glass
the
taste
and
aftertaste
both
have
that
funkiness
that
i
dont
like
this
is
generally
a
good
brewery
but
this
one
is
not
excellent
like
some
of
their
others
this
is
a
refreshing
pale
ale
with
prickly
carbonation
enjoyable
light
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
solid
offering
but
not
my
favorite
from
these
guys
i
usually
just
go
with
finest
kind
but
this
does
the
trick
nice
beer
perfect
for
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
football
its
filling
too
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
finished
smooth
easy
to
drink
ohad
about
a
year
ago
and
thought
it
was
a
great
apa
and
it
still
is
not
the
best
out
there
but
a
a
great
go
to
overall
i
tend
to
like
my
apas
on
the
dry
side
but
this
one
with
its
sweetness
and
balance
is
very
enjoyable
as
well
its
a
solid
apa
and
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
or
a
more
neutral
pairing
with
dinner
appearance
is
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
cloud
to
it
smell
is
right
hoppy
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
nice
this
beer
leave
the
mouth
well
and
has
the
right
hop
for
a
pale
ale
taste
is
well
good
for
this
style
of
beer
they
got
it
right
your
standard
pale
ale
over
all
we
like
this
and
feel
it
is
the
right
beer
for
some
good
wings
overall
it
doesnt
wow
and
its
a
little
bland
there
is
an
initial
burst
of
flavor
but
it
dies
quickly
not
terrible
but
not
good
either
like
i
said
right
down
the
middle
amber
not
pale
this
is
an
okay
pale
ale
with
maybe
too
many
acidic
earthy
and
metallic
elements
thinking
about
it
if
this
was
labeled
as
an
english
pale
ale
i
wouldve
approached
it
differently
and
perhaps
given
it
another
rating
altogether
overall
a
fine
pale
ale
no
wowfactor
but
relatively
tasty
and
enjoyable
might
not
necessarily
seek
it
out
but
would
be
more
than
up
for
a
revisit
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
drink
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
smuttynose
beers
i
have
tried
and
this
one
is
as
good
as
the
others
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
good
tastes
and
flavors
a
wellbalanced
apa
hoppy
but
not
too
much
so
aroma
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
but
its
wellbalanced
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
jeopardize
that
body
could
be
thinned
just
a
bit
for
the
styles
sake
though
im
happy
with
it
as
is
overall
very
drinkable
o
didnt
expect
a
lot
from
this
but
for
a
low
abv
low
price
pale
ale
its
one
of
the
best
i
can
recall
a
bit
hoppier
than
your
typical
pa
and
nothing
wrong
with
that
a
beer
drinkers
pale
ale
cheers
o
good
pale
ale
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
solid
brew
that
hangs
in
there
with
the
best
overall
this
is
a
pretty
meh
beer
for
me
totally
decent
but
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
this
beer
looked
great
but
i
felt
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
a
bit
too
much
earthy
hops
i
think
this
is
personal
taste
though
i
liked
the
full
sail
pale
ale
slightly
better
o
very
enjoyable
beer
will
definitely
drink
another
the
smuttynose
shoals
pale
ale
reminds
me
alot
of
sierra
nevadas
fresh
hop
ale
the
appearance
is
only
lacking
in
teh
head
department
very
thin
white
in
color
the
color
is
a
rich
amber
and
thebeer
is
clear
the
smell
is
of
hops
that
leans
more
towards
pine
than
citrus
guessing
casscade
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
a
fresh
hop
that
is
balanced
by
malt
tyhe
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
coud
drink
a
fair
amount
o
a
bit
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
but
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
unique
apa
really
questions
the
style
but
a
good
beer
for
sure
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
poured
ontap
at
the
portsmouth
brewery
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
bright
copper
coloring
very
light
with
a
thin
white
head
that
clings
very
well
the
nose
is
caramel
malt
but
light
with
a
steady
dry
hopped
background
the
flavor
is
grapefruit
sweet
with
pepper
and
oregano
spicy
hops
throughout
great
blend
into
an
aftertaste
of
citrus
and
a
clean
smooth
finish
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
head
that
fades
after
a
couple
of
minutes
but
leaves
a
good
lacing
smell
is
bready
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
with
an
underlying
sweetness
taste
is
my
favorite
part
herevery
crisp
bite
with
a
good
bitterness
and
some
faint
floral
notes
balanced
very
well
lots
of
carbonation
but
finishes
smoothly
overall
a
very
strong
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
will
have
again
taste
starts
off
with
a
caramel
malt
base
followed
by
a
variety
of
fruit
notes
bit
of
apple
maybe
a
pear
followed
by
some
orange
and
grapefruit
tones
which
is
finished
off
with
some
grassy
hops
fair
amount
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
winds
up
with
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
i
would
be
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
lived
up
there
in
new
england
if
i
were
an
east
coast
guy
this
would
easily
make
it
into
my
rotation
o
im
not
a
big
hops
guy
but
i
would
have
to
say
this
one
was
pretty
balanced
abv
was
good
so
you
could
session
this
one
worth
looking
for
if
you
like
the
style
taste
bread
and
caramel
malt
but
not
too
sweet
with
substantial
bitterness
and
a

overall
a
complete
surprise
a
beer
that
comes
off
on
the
nose
as
a
solid
ipa
but
surprises
you
with
its
malt
and
pale
ale
power
the
force
is
strong
with
this
one
this
is
a
very
impressive
pale
ale
overall
a
decent
solid
beer
poured
into
a
deschutes
pint
glass
the
body
appears
much
darker
than
expected
it
is
a
murky
brownamber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
frothy
offwhite
head
that
seems
to
last
forever
long
strands
of
wet
lacing
cling
to
the
edge
of
the
glass
it
looks
much
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
a
pale
but
that
makes
it
slightly
more
intriguing
smell
is
of
typical
pale
ale
scents
grass
straw
hay
some
floral
hops
faint
citrus
mostly
lemon
touch
of
orange
taste
is
similar
with
the
grassy
notes
taking
the
forefront
along
with
some
other
grains
wheat
hay
a
smooth
malt
makes
up
the
middle
and
it
finishes
with
the
hop
flavor
mouth
is
smooth
throughout
the
carbonation
and
hops
lightening
the
body
a
bit
overall
id
probably
reach
for
a
slightly
lighter
pale
were
i
in
the
sun
but
for
a
shade
sipper
this
one
certainly
does
the
trick
m
crisp
and
light
bodied
carbonation
at
a
good
level
nice
aftertaste
final
thoughts
i
love
this
one
its
very
simplistic
but
it
is
done
in
such
a
great
way
it
seems
to
take
ques
from
both
british
style
pa
and
american
style
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
o
another
good
yearround
brew
from
smuttynose
a
little
more
malty
than
most
other
apas
but
still
pretty
tasty
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
a
nice
off
white

citrusy
earthy
hops
fill
the
nose
with

malt
and
citrusy
piney
hops
palate
is
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
malt
some
yeastiness
followed
by
citrusy
earthy
hops
and
light
fruity
ending
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
decent
pale
that
in
the
end
ends
up
working
but
it
has
its
moments
that
concerned
me
a
bit
o
its
definitely
tasty
with
some
nice
muted
hop
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
crazy
about
the
aroma
above
average
beer
o
not
a
bad
outing
but
there
are
beaches
out
there
with
warmer
sand
and
better
views
so
to
speak
this
is
an
amazingly
balanced
pale
ale
the
hop
bite
really
keeps
things
interesting
but
doesnt
go
overboard
you
can
really
taste
the
bready
malts
and
caramel
malts
when
you
breathe
out
of
your
nose
on
the
aftertaste
the
hop
bite
sticks
around
for
a
bit
as
well
although
straight
forward
its
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
its
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
best
pale
ales
and
definitely
makes
the
top
3
for
me
although
ive
had
pale
ales
that
taste
very
hoppy
this
one
has
a
very
nice
rich
malt
taste
reminiscent
of
like
i
said
the
samuel
adams
boston
lager
but
with
more
of
a
floral
bitter
hop
bite
excellent
beer

great
session
beer
will
be
picking
this
up
for
beach
pool
days
for
sure
had
this
on
tap
at
ciao
2
in
robinson
a
small
italian
cafe
known
for
a
nice
small
beer
selection
and
a
3
dollar
draft
happy
hora
this
place
has
a
beer
on
draft
called
412
ale
the
local
area
code
brewed
by
smuttynose
ive
had
shoals
in
the
past
and
this
is
definitely
a
reissue
of
that
same
beer
with
a
new
label
which
is
fine
by
me
i
dont
see
the
shoals
pale
ale
locally
very
often
so
thats
fine
plus
its
really
drinking
great
on
tap
a
pale
copper
hue
with
an
off
white
cream
head
forms
fine
even
lacing
mild
fruity
nose
with
herbal
mild
citric
hops
a
very
nice
baked
breadiness
going
on
with
each
sip
solid
sipper
for
any
occasion
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
slight
trace
of
hop
oils
finishes
with
a
mild
welcoming
bitterness
overall
quality
beverage
that
i
will
try
every
time
im
there
and
if
i
can
get
it
in
sixers
better
yet
pours
a
clear
shiny
amber
color
with
no
foam
or
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
citrus
with
a
hint
of
dough
the
flavor
has
caramel
grapefruit
and
roasted
malt
notes
it
beging
with
malt
sweetness
and
is
followed
by
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
smuttynose
shoals
pale
ale
is
an
ok
beer
not
recommended
overall
its
a
decent
pale
ale
but
unmemorable
it
just
gets
lost
in
the
mix
when
i
have
so
many
top
notch
pales
locally
daisy
cutter
alpha
king
zombie
dust
moon
man
i
suppose
i
prefer
a
more
hop
forward
pale
as
well
o
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
and
sessionable
awesomeness
overall
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
it
is
good
for
a
hot
lemoore
afternoon
thanks
to
inlimbo77
for
this
nice
beer
o
its
not
too
complex
but
is
drinkable
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
outstanding
either
impressions
ill
recommend
this
one
to
my
drinking
buddies
and
next
time
we
have
a
tasting
that
is
centered
on
pale
ales
ill
definitely
bring
this
one
along
i
guess
i
need
to
study
up
on
the
differences
between
an
american
pa
and
an
english
pa
because
in
my
opinion
this
definitely
seems
like
it
takes
aim
at
the
british
al
in
all
a
very
good
beer
though
pours
a
beautiful
amber
generous
head
and
lacing
smell
is
not
overly
strong
but
has
nice
hints
of
citrus
pine
and
grass
smell
and
taste
is
clean
and
balanced
not
too
bitter
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
pleasant
hops
bitter
and
offsetting
malty
balance
very
drinkable
nothing
screams
out
just
a
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
with
subtle
nuances
yummy
would
definitely
buy
again
overallnot
very
impressed
with
this
or
the
finest
kind
drinkable
but
ehh
cheers
odi
like
this
beer
it
perplexes
me
there
are
a
few
aspects
of
this
beer
that
are
hard
to
describe
as
a
whole
i
really
like
this
beer
its
sessionable
but
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
i
will
likely
buy
another
sixpack
in
order
to
further
dissect
the
flavor
profile
found
in
shoals
pale
ale
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
as
hoppy
as
some
but
it
still
showcases
the
hops
flavors
that
define
the
american
version
of
the
style
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
big
bubble
head
that
dissipates
quickly
down
to
some
small
puddles
a
lot
of
sweet
bread
and
biscuit
in
the
nose
some
white
wheat
as
well
a
resinous
hop
aroma
that
is
sharp
over
the
body
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
coming
out
of
a
growler
i
get
a
lot
of
the
malt
at
first
some
of
the
biscuit
but
mainly
a
medium
bodied
carameltoffee
flavor
a
quick
transition
to
a
pineresin
texture
that
is
dry
but
because
of
the
relatively
heavy
malt
body
it
balances
out
my
pour
resulted
in
just
better
than
a
finger
of
thick
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
smelled
nicely
of
piney
hops
and
i
wonder
if
anyone
has
considered
hops
potpourri
or
air
freshener
there
was
also
an
underlying
caramel
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
justright
amount
of
hops
for
before
bedtime
it
made
me
want
to
go
inside
the
samuel
haley
house
on
smuttynose
island
look
for
a
bed
that
would
be
just
right
not
too
hard
and
not
too
soft
and
lie
down
the
lacing
in
the
glass
was
nothing
short
of
beautiful
as
i
drank
it
was
maybe
a
little
more
malty
than
the
brewer
had
intended
best
before
march
2011
but
i
was
satisfied
with
the
intermingling
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
soft
smooth
eminently
drinkable
and
zzzz
aroma
is
light
nice
little
notes
of
citrus
hints
of
apple
pears
light
grasses
and
a
smooth
even
flavor
or
light
fruity
yeast
as
i
take
the
first
sip
i
get
the
clean
crisp
flavor
right
off
the
bat
really
nicely
done
clean
and
light
hops
a
good
strain
of
yeast
and
very
nice
carbonation
all
lead
to
a
solid
pale
overall
a
halfway
decent
pale
ale
nothing
too
impressive
and
something
seems
a
bit
off
at
times
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
excellent
malt
and
hop
balance
here
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
very
well
the
hop
profile
while
a
bit
simple
is
really
nice
a
very
solid
and
sessionable
beer
from
smuttynose
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
good
beer
give
it
a
go
o
a
decent
pale
i
could
drink
throughout
an
evening
not
the
most
spectacular
and
it
has
its
shortcomings
but
it
has
enough
flavor
at
least
up
front
and
goes
down
easy
o
ill
get
it
again
not
much
of
a
selection
within
a
5
minute
drive
of
me
but
i
found
this
all
aloneno
other
smuttynose
selection
at
a
place
ive
never
been
to
before
overall
a
pretty
decent
apa
nothing
groundbreaking
just
a
good
clean
well
made
apa
recommended
drinkability
the
smell
was
a
little
offputting
with
its
power
but
once
i
started
drinking
it
everything
began
to
mellow
out
overall
pretty
interesting
and
tasty
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
has
a
great
scent
of
matlts
and
hops
first
comes
the
malts
when
you
taste
it
then
the
hops
its
an
awkward
effect
it
seems
that
after
you
swallow
the
beer
that
there
becomes
a
growing
hops
taste
on
your
tounge
not
something
that
is
going
to
appeal
to
everyone
but
thoe
who
love
pale
ales
and
hops
with
enjoy
this
one
a
decent
american
pale
ale
but
only
slightly
above
average
ostraight
forward
but
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
sierra
nevadas
and
victorys
of
the
pale
ale
world
o
a
crisp
and
refreshing
hopforward
pale
ale
in
more
of
an
english
style
than
american
i
find
the
flavor
profile
very
well
balanced
decent
bitterness
and
hop
presence
thats
well
balanced
with
clean
toasted
malt
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
combat
the
hop
bitterness
a
great
summer
sessionable
thirstquenching
refreshing
alcoholic
beverage
a
good
hoppy
pale
ale
that
has
differing
hop
flavors
a
good
beer
all
around
overall
this
beer
is
great
and
i
would
order
it
in
a
bar
or
suggest
it
to
a
friend
who
is
getting
into
craft
d
very
good
go
to
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
enough
it
has
a
bit
of
a
presence
to
it
thickness
wise
but
is
highly
carbonated
which
works
with
the
prickliness
the
drinkability
is
also
quite
good
a
solid
pale
ale
thats
a
lot
closer
to
the
english
style
than
the
american
my
bottle
still
had
five
months
out
on
the
freshness
date
so
its
surely
fresh
enough
at
only
5
abv
this
beer
is
relatively
light
but
packs
plenty
of
flavors
nice
crisp
but
slightly
wet
mouthfeel
leaving
you
wanting
more
overall
a
simple
straight
forward
easy
drinking
apa
d
definitely
drinkable
the
only
factor
that
would
hinder
it
would
be
the
lingering
sticky
bitterness
i
like
my
pale
ales
to
smack
you
in
the
tongue
and
then
retreat
the
cowards
that
they
are
also
malt
bill
is
a
bit
boring
still
an
all
around
decent
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
apas
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
high
on
the
list
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
the
taste
is
pale
with
a
large
amount
of
crystal
malt
taste
and
finishes
sweet
and
slight
bitter
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
a
full
session
with
a
darker
amberbrownish
color
hurtin
head
retention
but
otherwise
looking
very
appetizing
judging
by
the
nose
i
feel
like
this
beer
has
american
hops
with
an
u
k
yeast
stain
malty
sweet
and
bitter
with
yeasty
finish
maybe
slightly
oxidized
not
the
least
bit
scorching
like
an
ipa
might
seem
smooth
but
powerful
bitterness
i
like
that
they
have
bottle
conditioning
good
beer
nice
for
a
good
session
a
really
solid
pale
ale
very
dry
and
bitter
quite
different
from
snpa
but
very
enjoyable
da
really
easy
drinking
nice
pale
thats
nicely
balanced
between
the
bitterness
and
malts
d
definitely
drinkable
could
be
a
session
beer
the
salt
factor
could
be
a
distraction
but
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
pleasant
enough
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
piney
and
citrusy
hops
upfront
along
with
a
strong
caramel
and
toasted
bread
maltiness
as
well
as
some
fruity
esters
and
a
trace
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
with
citrusy
and
piney
hops
in
the
forefront
along
with
some
caramel
fruity
esters
toasted
bread
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
not
particularly
complex
but
executed
flawlessly
bought
a
six
pack
from
table
and
vine
slight
ambercolor
to
a
general
copper
look
to
the
drink
heavy
patching
on
the
sides
i
could
sense
a
tangy
citrus
aroma
but
it
seemed
a
little
subtle
decently
bitter
taste
to
a
balanced
hoppy
taste
pretty
light
and
crisp
to
me
very
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
apa
drinkability
is
very
good
i
like
the
biscuity
notes
this
is
from
a
bottle
that
is
good
until
feb
11
and
is
being
consumed
on
2
9

into
a
pint
glass
this
holds
a
murky
and
heavy
orangeamber
color
that
would
soon
border
into
brown
nose
carries
a
hop
aroma
between
moderate
and
strong
with
a
nice
anonymous
mix
of
well
blended
citrus
upfront
theres
a
sweet
and
sour
bright
bitter
hop
feel
that
glides
over
the
palate
into
an
almost
creamy
malt
feel
into
a
deep
resonating
aftertaste
of
hops
thats
generously
supported
by
a
robust
malt
backbone
cheers
to
an
apa
with
some
extra
kick
revisited
with
no
need
for
rating

in
feb
2012
drinkability
was
average
for
me
as
it
went
down
pretty
easy
but
the
flavor
just
didnt
blow
me
away
a
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
poured
from
th
bottle
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
plenty
of
head
retention
with
foam
sticky
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
had
a
dark
color
for
an
apa
and
a
very
earthy
finish
the
first
sip
is
quite
hoppy
but
is
slightly
sweet
on
the
way
down
this
a
great
session
or
sipping
brew
well
worth
picking
up
a
six
pack
i
have
to
put
shoals
pale
ale
in
an
elite
group
with
the
very
best
pale
ales
i
am
so
happy
we
get
a
great
selection
of
smuttynose
beers
here
in
atlanta
the
taste
starts
with
some
nice
caramel
toasted
bread
and
spicey
orange
hops
teh
middle
has
the
hops
turn
into
a
faint
tropical
fruit
you
can
really
feel
the
carbination
well
in
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
but
more
slick
on
the
lingering
finish
a
nice
session
apa
from
nh
a
good
choice
for
summer
as
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
d
not
all
that
bad
but
not
great
either
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
here
drinkability
balanced
easydrinking
i
like
it
moreover
there
are
some
flaws
keeping
it
from
being
betterthanaverage
since
smuttynose
hasnt
even
been
around
il
long
enough
for
me
to
get
a
bottle
past
its
prime
ill
assume
its
the
beer
and
not
my
specific
bottle
head
disappears
quickly
has
a
fairly
dark
amber
color
with
a
malty
slightly
sweet
smell
the
taste
follows
the
smell
more
malty
than
hoppy
i
remember
really
liking
this
beer
on
tap
a
few
years
ago
at
a
restaurant
in
cape
cod
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
a
good
not
great
beer
with
low
alcohol
you
could
have
many
of
these
but
i
prefer
dividing
my
time
with
the
other
beers
in
the
mix12
this
came
with
pale
ales
in
my
experience
are
not
bursting
with
taste
so
this
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
pours
an
off
white
2
finger
head
fairly
clear
dark
golden
color
darker
than
i
expected
for
a
pale
ale
smells
faintly
of
some
grassy
hops
a
touch
of
caramel
tastes
some
malt
sweetness
up
front
with
a
transition
to
a
strong
earthiness
grassy
and
some
graininess
the
finish
has
some
lingering
bitterness
which
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
medium
carbing
medium
body
with
a
good
bit
of
creaminess
in
each
sip
1
80
a
single
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
nice
flavors
and
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
wasnt
nearly
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
the
popular
apas
but
the
balty
flavors
it
brought
instead
were
pretty
nice
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
very
solid
every
day
beer
i
would
actually
prefer
over
some
higher
abv
pale
ales
which
are
fantastic
but
not
suited
for
many
like
celebration
ale
d
high
level
of
drinkability
here
great
apa
overall
a
drinkable
but
not
great
apa
surprisingly
metallic
and
musty
pretty
decent
session
style
pale
ale
drinkability
very
drinkable
light
and
quite
refreshing
i
wanted
to
taste
a
little
more
body
after
the
nose
started
so
promising
but
in
the
end
still
a
very
good
brew
drinkability
going
into
this
beer
i
thought
this
would
be
just
another
boring
apa
but
boy
was
wrong
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
while
not
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
its
worth
a
shot
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
apa
it
was
full
of
flavor
and
well
balanced
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
d
great
drinkability
this
is
a
great
great
great
pale
ale
will
be
getting
this
again
in
the
future
many
a
time
just
so
true
to
the
style
and
it
doesnt
get
much
better
done
than
this
im
impressed
pours
an
opaque
copper
color
with
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
mild
hops
citrus
and
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
underwhelming
mild
hop
taste
and
finishes
with
a
malty
backbone
the
taste
does
not
linger
though
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
i
like
this
beer
but
it
does
not
compare
in
my
book
to
sierra
nevada
12
oz
bottle
pours
copper
somewhat
on
a
darker
side
of
pale
ales
with
a
lasting
offwhite
head
aroma
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
citrus
piney
hops
some
sweet
malt
in
the
background
light
to
medium
tangy
body
long
dry
bitter
finish
nothing
is
wrong
with
this
brew
but
personally
i
prefer
a
little
more
balance
in
my
pale
ales
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
so
far
its
been
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
theres
alot
of
taste
packed
into
this
little
5
abv
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
several
of
these
before
getting
sick
of
them
check
this
one
out
if
you
havnt
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
strong
with
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
hops
more
than
most
pale
ales
no
real
malt
balance
to
speak
of
feels
medium
bodied
and
bitter
in
the
mouth
and
has
below
average
drinkability
overall
a
good
pale
ale
for
serious
hop
heads
otherwise
very
mediocre
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
because
i
love
the
portsmouth
area
i
wasnt
disappointed
i
poured
from
a
bottle
a
dark
amber
beer
with
a
big
light
tan
head
that
stays
for
the
first
several
sips
or
gulps
the
smell
was
sweet
with
good
balanced
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
also
somewaht
sweeter
than
expected
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
keep
it
in
stock
for
those
lazy
winter
evenings
by
the
woodstove
drinkability
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
warm
summer
evening
great
pale
ale
well
something
made
me
buy
a
six
of
this
brew
over
the
past
weekend
after
years
of
ignoring
it
glad
i
did
this
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
one
inch
head
that
fades
to
a
lasting
cap
nose
is
a
nice
mild
malty
bready
hop
mix
where
this
brew
shines
is
taste
really
good
competes
with
sierra
nevada
in
my
book
and
thats
high
praise
perfect
blend
of
hoppy
bitterness
malt
and
some
bready
yeast
flavors
none
over
the
topvery
harmonious
an
excellent
drinking
pale
ale
that
should
not
be
passed
over
glad
to
see
smuttynose
at
my
local
store
this
one
i
know
is
fresh
cause
chicagoland
just
started
carrying
the
brand
pours
out
a
deep
kinda
dark
copper
color
with
a
thinning
but
still
thick
head
the
beer
is
also
slightly
cloudy
and
i
like
that
sort
of
thing
anyways
the
smell
is
really
nice
of
almost
resiney
citrusy
spicy
hop
goodness
i
cannot
wait
to
taste
this
beer
yes
it
even
smells
dry
hopped
wow
first
impression
is
very
hoppy
yet
smooth
and
balanced
the
aftertaste
also
has
like
that
second
layer
of
alpha
acid
hops
making
it
quite
threedimensional
but
gosh
the
malt
base
keeps
it
together
with
vague
toastyness
and
this
beer
is
remarkably
well
crafted
an
astonishing
pale
ale
ranks
up
there
with
classics
like
sierra
nevada
nice
lacing
all
around
my
glass
moutfeel
is
smooth
as
well
not
overly
carbonated
not
too
thick
just
right
soo
this
one
vaguely
reminds
me
of
snpa
but
in
fact
smoother
and
more
complex
hop
taste
i
could
imagine
this
being
a
delicious
beer
with
hot
wings
spicey
indian
food
you
name
it
i
look
forward
to
being
able
to
enjoy
more
of
this
beer
in
the
not
too
distant
future
and
will
seek
out
more
of
their
offerings
at
the
store
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
january
2011
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
some
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
some
hops
taste
has
a
bit
of
a
hop
flavor
to
it
some
caramel
and
malts
slight
bitterness
pretty
decent
pale
ale
not
too
much
of
a
taste
or
flavor
of
hops
but
a
nice
caramel
flavor
pours
amber
with
a
bit
of
a
light
head
and
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
out
some
pale
malts
as
well
as
some
light
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
taste
really
combines
the
citrus
hop
flavors
and
pale
malt
quite
well
really
befitting
of
a
good
apa
good
bitterness
and
a
nice
body
drinkability
is
high
and
on
par
with
some
of
the
better
east
coast
apas
drink
an
above
average
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
tasted
still
worth
seeking
out
d
this
is
an
all
around
great
apa
not
too
hoppy
but
just
enough
and
the
malt
presence
is
good
i
feel
that
for
the
high
quality
in
flavors
and
overall
intensity
there
should
be
a
bit
more
abv
in
this
beer
but
sessioning
this
one
would
be
easier
the
way
it
is
d
this
one
scores
high
on
drinkability
if
it
where
available
in
mo
i
would
be
looking
for
it
often
i
quite
enjoy
it
excellent
pale
ale
enough
hops
to
give
the
mouth
a
pleasant
taste
and
not
too
much
to
make
it
cloying
the
taste
has
chocolate
notes
to
it
carbonation
is
not
high
but
it
is
very
smooth
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
experience
the
malt
and
hops
work
perfect
and
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
apa
and
definitely
worth
a
try
it
kind
of
feels
like
finest
kind
lite
and
that
certainly
isnt
a
bad
thing
cheers
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
slightly
murky
dark
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
crisp
citrus
hops
and
pale
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
crisp
citrus
hops
in
front
of
sweet
pale
malts
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
crisp
with
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
numerous
hop
heavy
pale
ales
available
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
this
brewery
definite
repeater
great
flavors
neither
the
malt
nor
hops
are
overwhelming
and
this
beer
definitely
wont
bore
you
and
at
the
same
time
it
wont
fatigue
your
tongue
its
a
good
sessionable
beer
making
it
great
for
a
warm
weather
bbq
or
with
pizza
this
is
a
really
good
goto
beer
for
craft
beer
enthusiasts
and
also
a
good
full
flavor
beer
to
introduce
your
friends
to
who
dont
drink
much
besides
the
big
brands
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
around
right
up
there
with
whales
tale
in
my
book
and
a
favorite
standby
of
mine
this
pale
is
a
dark
reddish
copper
color
with
just
sturdy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thing
layer
that
leaves
fine
webbing
inside
the
glass
the
smell
is
has
pine
and
grapefruit
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
caramelized
crackery
malt
aroma
the
beer
is
assertively
bitter
with
a
resinous
spruce
bitterness
that
dominates
followed
by
a
bready
sweetness
and
finishing
with
an
pleasant
astringent
grapefruit
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
carbonation
appropriated
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
enjoyable
even
as
it
warms
up
a
great
sessionable
beer
now
one
of
my
top
pale
ales
and
one
of
my
top
offerings
from
smuttynose
that
ive
tried
so
far
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
definatly
worth
a
try
notes
for
me
this
is
a
well
done
pale
ale
d
its
a
decent
apa
the
hint
of
fruit
can
make
it
or
break
it
for
people
though
it
really
is
faint
kind
of
turned
me
off
overall
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
apa
probably
my
next
favorite
after
sierra
nevadas
offering
wellputtogether
goodlooking
and
feels
good
going
down
now
if
i
can
just
find
a
woman
with
similar
qualities
haha
another
solid
one
from
smuttynose
these
dudes
dont
disappoint
flavor
follows
with
that
wood
character
found
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
dry
leaves
malt
is
simple
full
flavored
an
the
focus
of
the
flavor
of
this
beer
with
some
really
nice
dark
fruit
tones
bitterness
is
solid
and
brings
a
slight
fruity
hop
flavor
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
with
solid
carbonation
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
englishamerican
pale
ales
really
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
american
style
is
that
is
above
2
5
abv
mmmmm
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
i
generally
like
the
less
malty
americanstyle
pale
ales
but
this
bad
boy
may
sway
me
to
the
darker
side
this
is
very
hoppy
too
which
is
a
plus
for
me
but
not
a
surprise
since
it
is
coming
from
the
brewer
of
my
favorite
ipa
drinkability
great
american
pale
ale
smuttynose
sure
knows
how
to
make
fantastic
beers
the
hop
presence
tastes
similar
to
their
ipa
but
that
doesnt
detract
from
this
beer
at
all
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
excellent
drinkability
a
wellcrafted
apa
that
tips
the
scale
towards
the
hoppy
side
definitely
worth
a
shot
seek
it
out
pours

a
small
cap

with
touches
of

balanced
a
nice
bitter
and

solid
presence
of
dried
grain
and
light

lighter

a
decent

this
beer
pours
a
murky
deep
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
nice
spotty

you
could
see
the

bubbles
dancing
in
this
beer
crisp
feel
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
goes
down
nice
and
easy
highly
sessionable
beer
d
a
great
tasting
beer
perfect
balance
and
verry
refreshing
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
just
the
slightest
bit
darker
than
i
expected
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
overly
dark
goldenamber
color
with
slight
haze
from
particles
inside
an
offwhite
trying
to
by
orange
head
appears
and
hangs
out
around
the
edges
for
the
entire
beverage
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
lacing
to
this
though
just
around
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
good
cascade
hops
dominate
the
nose
at
first
citrus
and
floral
aromas
you
can
also
tell
by
the
smell
that
it
is
well
malted
pale
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
outstanding
perfectly
balanced
malthop
combination
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
roasted
and
id
say
caramelized
malts
the
distinct
hop
flavors
follow
a
slightly
bitter
citrusy
taste
that
complement
each
other
perfectly
this
pale
ale
can
easily
be
drank
all
year
round
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
medium
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
feel
the
start
of
sweetness
and
the
bitter
finish
feels
clean
this
beer
is
close
to
as
drinkable
as
can
be
without
being
perfect
as
mentioned
earlier
its
a
year
round
drinkable
pale
ale
a
good
introduction
on
what
pale
ales
should
be
like
a
home
run
by
smuttynose
in
my
opinion
pours
a
slightly
copper
orange
offwhite
sticky
head
smell
is
invigorating
like
an
ocean
breeze
but
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
taste
is
grapefruit
pulp
almost
chewy
with
a
nice
earthy
backdrop
the
citrus
permeates
the
finish
finishes
fizzy
and
dry
darn
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
d
great
for
a
beer
after
work
or
with
the
guys
not
one
you
drink
too
much
of
but
great
for
any
time
one
of
the
better
heads
on
a
pale
ale
hoppier
than
most
of
its
variety
good
amount
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
hop
that
to
start
turns
sweet
caramel
malt
that
finishes
smooth
but
once
you
think
the
beer
is
done
with
you
comes
back
with
a
little
dryness
great
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
nothing
particularly
outstanding
or
unique
just
a
wellcrafted
ale
nice
pour
on
this
beer
major
head
comes
down
after
a
bit
turns
into
a
light
lacing
around
the
top
of
the
glass
dark
brown
light
brown
beer
tastes
very
light
similar
to
most
pale
ales
but
has
the
brown
color
and
malt
flavor
to
more
of
a
degree
than
i
have
had
in
a
pale
ale
a
welcome
change
in
that
i
thought
the
beer
had
good
flavor
a
little
something
extra
added
to
it
still
has
the
bitter
taste
mostly
at
the
finish
goes
down
smooth
tastes
almost
sweet
at
the
beginning
as
you
are
drinking
then
finishes
bitter
i
like
the
balance
i
like
the
different
flavors
that
come
out
as
you
drink
it
all
in
all
very
good
definitely
something
you
could
have
a
fair
share
of
and
still
be
ok
nice
offering
body
drinkability
fully
inline
with
the
style
leaving
very
tasty
pale
which
can
be
drunken
in
abundance
looking
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
keep
trying
this
brewery
but
im
disappointed
every
time
ive
mostly
tried
various
pale
ales
and
i
just
find
them
very
bitter
with
an
unpleasant
aspiriny
aftertaste
maybe
its
just
me
and
something
with
my
palate
because
im
clearly
in
the
minority
here
lots
of
people
seem
to
love
their
beer
im
just
not
one
of
them
need
to
move
on
and
try
something
new
now
cheers
nice
beer
really
well
crafted
flavorful
and
classic
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
so
far
its
not
crazy
hoppy
smelling
like
some
and
its
not
super
bitter
like
some
pale
ales
that
border
ipas
im
about
to
have
this
with
a
cheeseburger
and
fries
and
im
pumped
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
low
abv
along
with
a
nice
hop
profile
and
great
taste
make
this
an
easily
sessionable
beer
very
good
apa
worth
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
beer
is
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
there
are
many
other
things
id
rather
get
from
nh
especially
from
smuttynose
but
no
major
complaints
here
d
a
nice
refreshing
pale
ale
on
the
more
hoppy
end
of
things
tastea
bit
fruity
with
a
citrusrind
bitterness
throughout
tasty
and
snappy
with
a
nice
hoppy
backbone
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
goto
pale
ale
to
keep
in
the
fridge
three
bottles
of
this
come
as
part
of
the
variety
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
copper
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
definitely
can
notice
the
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
quite
good
for
it
stays
true
to
the
style
theres
a
nice
dose
of
hops
but
also
just
enough
malt
in
the
background
to
balance
things
out
just
enough
hops
to
notice
but
not
enough
to
overpower
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
with
only
an
abv
of
5
its
quite
drinkable
a
top
notch
apa
right
up
there
with
the
classics
of
the
style
d
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
i
wish
i
would
have
noticed
more
in
the
nose
d
very
drinkable
for
a
apa
not
quite
a
sipper
but
a
good
session
apa
nice
hazy
orange
taste
is
a
perfect
mix
of
hop
and
maltvery
earthy
hop
character
and
biscuit
malt
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
just
about
the
perfect
amount
drinkability
is
extremely
high
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
apas
i
would
easily
keep
several
of
these
on
hand
very
versatile
i
could
see
myself
turning
to
this
beer
and
some
mlb
games
on
warm
summer
evenings
overall
an
outstanding
session
brew
from
an
outstanding
ne
brewery
d
very
solid
apa
overall
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
in
the
fridge
definitely
one
id
ble
glad
to
cross
paths
with
again
but
not
sure
id
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
hunt
it
down

head

both
pretty
good
aroma
is
pine

citrusy
hops
and
some
caramel

taste
is
much
hoppier
compared
to
the
aroma
the
brew
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
like
pine
and
citrusy
hops
and
some
grainbready
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
its
enjoyable
to
drink
and
not
a
bad
choice
for
an
occasional
session
beer
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
but
ill
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
in
the
future
i
think
its
a
good
sessionable
apa
drinkability
a
good
apa
but
nothing
that
puts
it
in
the
upper
echelon
of
pale
ales
md
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
a
bit
biting
with
the
heavy
bitterness
this
isnt
a
particularly
drinkable
pale
ale
but
its
well
on
its
way
to
an
ipa
medium
bodied
fairly
strong
effervescence
up
front
dry
finish
with
a
strong
hop
aftertaste
knock
on
taste
due
to
lack
of
any
complexity
knock
on
smell
due
to
mustycardboard
notes
though
the
balance
was
good
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
too
ipa
for
me
d
solid
apa
there
are
others
i
would
go
to
first
just
missing
something
else
either
more
citrus
hops
or
slightly
sweeter
malt
a
very
solid
pale
ale
that
holds
more
malt
flavor
think
amber
ales
than
expected
and
with
an
aggressive
and
sometimes
bitey
bitterness
that
seems
slightly
out
of
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
still
deserving
of
high
marks
thanks
stiggs
d
exceedingly
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
guys
all
night
d
tasty
for
a
hop
lover
but
a
little
unbalanced
on
the
hop
side
more
like
a
light
ipa
a
great
pale
ale
in
my
book
should
have
the
best
of
both
ends
and
this
one
falls
short
in
the
grain
aisle
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
could
find
myself
straying
to
england
or
the
west
siiiide
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
interesting
to
me
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
dated
may
2010
and
sampled
on
january
14
2010
this
is
one
of
the
staple
brews
of
my
homestate
brewery
smuttynose
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
it
has
a
rich
aroma
balanced
with
a
little
barley
malts
and
an
upped
dosage
of
hops
the
taste
has
a
tart
cleanliness
about
it
with
a
mild
but
obvious
hoppy
ingredient
it
warms
the
insides
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
bottle
was
a
few
months
past
its
best
by
date
so
i
think
it
may
have
been
past
its
prime
i
think
this
beer
could
be
better
than
the
example
i
had
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
poured
16
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
got
a
1
finger
head
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
an
earthy
musty
kind
of
scent
taste
is
upfront
with
the
a
peppery
hop
note
the
slowly
fades
into
a
slight
malty
aftertaste
i
am
more
a
fan
of
citrusypiney
hops
so
that
is
why
it
did
not
score
so
well
with
me
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
six
pack
did
not
last
very
long
between
my
wife
and
i
notes
this
beer
has
some
good
qualities
notably
its
appearance
the
flavors
are
good
just
not
super
bold
or
anything
as
a
pale
ale
it
will
obviously
not
be
as
punchy
as
an
ipa
but
some
aspects
just
fall
a
little
short
of
excellent
very
average
drinkability
the
extent
of
the
bittering
is
a
bit
offputting
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
closer
to
that
of
an
ipa
than
an
apa
and
the
taste
is
like
a
light
ipa
as
well
dominant
hops
flavor
with
slight
malt
finish
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
typical
of
the
style
from
smuttynose
as
they
normally
seem
to
make
great
beers
without
trying
to
reinvent
the
wheel
drinkability
malty
apa
thats
not
afraid
to
expose
its
hoppier
side
crisp
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
id
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
d
nice
session
pale
ale
drink
is
excellent
a
well
balanced
beer
pale
ale
and
certainly
could
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
for
a
dry
beer
this
is
certainly
a
great
pick
a
fairly
drinkable
pale
ale
this
is
a
solid
but
not
exceedingly
interesting
beer
good
to
have
around
but
there
are
others
id
probably
be
more
inclined
to
go
for
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
as
my
favorite
pale
ale
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
good

this
beer

for

easy

d

very
easy
to

this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
night
and
several
of
them
quite
floral
and
very
satisfying
my
first
smuttynose
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
in
the
near
future
hopefully
t
very
bitter
but
with
limited
other
flavor
by
comparison
the
only
other
taste
i
got
was
a
burnt
smokey
flavor
md
mouthfeel
is
right

love
to
try
this

the
flavors
might
get
to
you
after
a
while
or
not
another
notch
on
the
smuttynose

more
english

overhopped
american
apas

pale

is
a
malty
pale
ale
thats
not
completely
shy
of
hops
a
better
choice
for
those
who
like
malty
beers
rather
then
hop
heads
a
great
staple
of
the

bill
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
to
anyone
who
likes
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
solid
stuff
here
i
really
enjoyed
this
pale
ale
from
the
folks
at
smuttynose
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
wellbalanced
d
wonderful
alot
of
flavor
but
not
too
much
that
you
couldnt
session
this
i
could
drink
aton
of
these
went
down
super
easily
i
will
be
buying
again

earthy

overall
a
decent

but
more
in
the
style
of
an
english
than
an
american
this
is
very
drinkable
even
though
it
has
as
much
hop
bitterness
as
a
number
of
ipas
ive
tried
perhaps
a
bit
more
than
i
prefer
in
a
pale
ale
but
very
good
nonetheless
as
it
is
an
artfully
made
beer
bought
this
as
part
of
the
smuttynose
variety
pack
not
a
loser
in
that
bunch
one
of
my
favorite
mixed
12s
i
have
access
to
this
pours

nice
orangeamber

nice
fluffy
head
to
it
moderate

nice
subtle
hop
aroma
with
some
bready
smells
as
well
this
beer
has
an
amazing
mouthfeel
and
perfect
body
to
it
just
smacks
you
right
on
on
the
tongue
and
is
well
balanced
nice
malt
backbone
and
a
kiss
of
hops
as
it
goes
down
smooth
super
drinkable
and
a
great
session
beer
highly
recommended
along
with
other
smutty
offerings
this
beer
poured
a
redtinted
amber
with
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
mostly
some
piney
hops
id
guess
cascade
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
good
malt
that
balances
the
piney
hops
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
great
version
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
smuttynose
beers
that
ive
tried
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
top
pas
on
the
market
d
highly
drinkable
and
packed
with
flavor
another
great
offering
from
smuttynose
d
not
overly
complex
and
well
balanced
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
has
a
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
which
makes
the
beer
drink
easy
di
can
drink
this
very
easily
d
like
most
beers
that
i
cant
get
around
here
i
would
love
to
drink
this
if
it
was
a
choice
good
all
around
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
wants
a
crisp
pale
ale
flavor
is
quite
good
id
put
this
up
against
sierra
nevada
any
day
in
the
pale
ale
category
and
chances
are
the
smutty
would
win
it
has
a
deeper
hop
profile
some
sweet
spice
and
a
slight
yeastiness
thanks
to
more
permeable
filtration
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
but
this
thing
goes
down
so
smooth
and
with
as
much
flavor
packed
in
there
as
possible
one
of
the
best
pales
in
new
england
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
balanced
with
lively
citrus
and
herbal
hop
notes
and
strong
malty
caramel
notes
the
taste
has
everything
the
aroma
does
with
the
addition
of
a
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
apa
it
has
every
good
thing
an
apa
can
have
and
all
in
ample
amounts
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
a
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
pale
ale
balance
is
spot
on
but
each
sips
retains
enough
hoppiness
to
keep
the
beer
interesting
d
oh
yes
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
very
nice
balance
with
plenty
of
malts
and
also
a
touch
of
bitter
finish
which
gives
it
a
nice
balance
could
picture
this
being
a
very
nice
summer
barbeque
beer
certainly
and
enjoyable
flavorful
beer
worth
trying
again
drinkability
recommended
as
a
quality
quaffable
pale
ale
d
another
really
good
really
flavorful
craft
brew
from
smuttynose
damn
i
wish
they
were
available
in
oregon
theyre
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
on
either
coast
or
anywhere
in
between
at
this
point
d
good
for
one
or
two
but
a
complete
session
would
be
out
of
the
question
i
would
recommend
other
apas
over
shoals
but
smuttynose
has
a
good
arsenal
of
beers
should
not
be
too
worried
about
it
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
very
complex
pale
ale
that
drinks
easily
one
sip
leads
to
another
and
another
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
all
night
as
there
is
just
enough
malt
to
temper
the
bitterness
and
create
a
balanced
beer
and
the
hops
play
back
and
forth
off
of
each
other
just
long
enough
to
demand
attention
but
not
so
long
as
to
be
unpleasant
redish
amber
with
light
carbonation
and
a
decent
white
head
smells
of
grass
and
some
citrus
hops
as
well
as
a
slight
whiff
of
malt
taste
is
very
malty
with
lots
of
grassy
hops
and
a
caramel
toastyness
that
reminds
me
more
of
an
esb
than
a
pale
ale
definitely
an
english
style
al
firmly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
medium
it
goes
down
easy
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
beers
that
i
would
rather
be
quaffing
right
now
d
4
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
normally
pass
over
for
something
more
balanced
or
flavorful
but
at
5
its
a
reasonable
sessioner
d
refreshing
and
downright
delicious
a
wonderful
session
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
more
of
the
shoals
to
help
wind
down
after
a
long
day
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
for
1
75
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
and
appears
a
clear
golden
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
bone
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
grains
grassy
earthy
hops
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
rather
drinkable
with
a
dry
finish
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
hops
gave
it
a
flavor
that
just
doesnt
rub
me
the
right
way
it
has
a
decent
flavor
its
worth
trying
sometime

lingers

the
aftertaste
a
chewy
medium

with
medium
carbonation
and
sessionable
abv
a
pleasant
warming
apa
strongly
recommend
trying
this
one
drinkability
is
exceptional
and
is
something
i
can
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
freezing
winter
one
this
is
another
great
session
beer
from
smuttynose
the
hops
and
malts
play
together
very
well
and
create
great
balance
this
has
something
that
everyone
will
like
the
finish
was
a
little
bit
too
bitter
for
me
but
overall
a
very
nice
brew
exceptionally
drinkable
overall
a
nice
american
pale
refreshing
enough
although
i
would
have
to
say
the
diacetyl
flavors
made
the
beer
taste
slightly
off
also
i
think
te
hops
were
a
little
too
grassy
although
bjcp
says
its
wrong
i
still
liked
the
beer
this
is
a
unique
pale
ale
i
like
pale
ales
with
a
tad
more
balance
with
malt
flavors
but
this
is
a
interesting
pale
ale
i
would
like
to
take
a
fresher
shoals
pale
ale
perhaps
one
on
draft
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
another
winner
for
smuttynose
brewing
company
the
beer
has
a
good
mix
of
flavor
and
session
that
makes
this
one
easy
to
revisit
taste
is
slightly
toasty
malt
at
the
front
with
piney
hops
emerging
alongside
a
slightly
bitter
breadcrusty
malt
note
that
eventually
gives
way
to
a
long
fairly
bitter
lingering
resiny
hop
note
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
fairly
balanced
and
different
though
the
hops
linger
a
bit
too
long
for
the
flavor
profile
in
my
opinion
decent
body
not
overcarbonated
a
good
drinkable
apa
that
i
could
easily
session
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
smuttynose
labels
this
as
an
interpretation
of
an
english
style
i
think
i
was
looking
for
more
of
an
epa
and
this
is
much
more
of
the
apa
as
labeled
above
not
particularly
smooth
but
certainly
full
flavor
the
combination
of
cascade
and
chinook
hops
arent
exactly
my
bag
of
tea
but
its
definitely
worth
a
swallow
if
thats
what
youre
into
one
of
the
better
bottled
apas
out
there
imho
great
appearance
with
lasting
head
and
lacing
from
top
to
bottom
hoppy
aroma
packed
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
that
of
hops
lots
of
citrusmainly
grapefruit
really
this
tastes
like
a
toned
down
version
of
smuttynoses
great
ipa
except
the
shoals
pale
is
much
more
sessionable
and
does
so
without
feeling
weak
how
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
has
higher
scores
on
here
is
perplexing
as
i
dont
feel
it
tastes
half
as
good
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
pours
copper
colored
with
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
lots
o
malts
and
floral
hops
not
sure
what
kind
of
hops
these
are
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
pine
needles
or
grapefruit
to
me
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
wellbalanced
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
deepish
copper
color
with
some
good
initial
head
and
a
bit
of
decent
lasting
lacing
good
scent
very
hoppy
nice
slight
citrus
aroma
with
it
wafts
up
nicely
if
not
as
strong
as
it
could
be
good
taste
a
little
unbalanced
nice
hops
some
good
american
citrus
tones
but
an
odd
almost
english
hoppiness
too
an
odd
mixture
goes
down
fine
if
not
great
a
good
apa
d
im
surprised
that
this
one
is
only
5
abv
this
one
is
packed
with
flavor
but
the
low
abv
keeps
it
pretty
damn
drinkable
and
would
make
for
a
nice
session
brew
this
will
definitely
be
one
of
my
goto
beers
in
the
future
highly
recommended
the
website
says
this
is
their
version
of
the
esb
um
ok
i
dont
see
it
boys
i
actually
wouldnt
mind
if
they
scaled
back
the
hops
a
bit
on
this
one
now
that
they
have
their
fantastic
ipa
and
this
is
no
longer
the
hop
bomb
to
todays
tastes
it
was
when
introduced
one
thing
smuttynose
seems
to
lack
in
their
arsenalwhich
is
formidableis
a
truly
balanced
ale
americans
can
do
it
i
just
know
itcf
sierra
nevadas
esb
there
is
something
nearly
perfect
about
this
bottling
i
dont
know
why
it
seems
like
a
sam
adams
taken
to
perfection
need
to
revisit
that
one
and
compare
d
a
bit
disappointing
the
hop
aroma
is
ok
but
the
flavor
is
bland
and
the
bitterness
is
quite
soapy
there
is
enough
malt
present
to
help
keep
it
balanced
but
it
is
too
dark
for
an
apa
and
despite
its
darkness
it
is
not
complex
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
d
very
fine
pale
ale
that
has
great
flavor
and
easy
drinking
written
all
over
it
can
easily
have
this
as
a
session
beer
nice
fresh
flavor
will
not
dissapoint
beer
lovers
of
all
varieties
d
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
but
its
not
what
i
expect
from
smutty
the
nose
and
feel
could
definitely
be
built
up
a
bit
the
look
and
taste
are
spot
on
and
make
this
a
nice
drinker
easy
to
crush
a
sixer
of
this
but
i
see
it
sitting
a
bit
heavy
without
the
bubbly
carbonation
though
not
bad
though
i
could
drink
this
beer
daily
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
session
brew
excellent
job
by
smuttynose
i
have
come
to
expect
nothing
less
a
style
that
unfortunately
gets
botched
by
too
many
brewer
as
a
weak
thin
effort
is
done
quite
well
by
smutty
a
good
pale
ale
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
quite
tasty
dr
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
easy
d
meh
overall
i
am
not
impressed
with
shoals
pale
ale
the
hops
arent
my
cup
of
tea
to
begin
with
but
beyond
that
the
brew
finishes
too
harsh
and
bitter
when
im
thining
of
a
nice
quaffable
pale
ale
carbonation
is
entirely
too
high
as
well
d
very
very
drinkable
goes
down
easily
and
very
easy
to
drink
alot
of
overall
this
brew
falls
into
the
ok
category
for
me
it
falls
just
short
in
every
category
for
my
taste
buds
while
i
would
say
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
brew
the
odd
aftertaste
would
cause
me
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
giving
this
one
a
go
worth
a
shot
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
this
one
looks
great
but
just
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
in
my
opinion
not
much
of
a
malt
presence
and
what
is
there
gets
overwhelmed
by
an
overly
blunt
hop
presence
and
some
off
flavors
pleasingly
thick
white
head
with
strong
lacing
semiopaque
copper
to
orangebrown
in
color
draws
in
light
well
kind
of
blunt

the
hops
arent

aggressive
as

has
a
very
mild
hoppiness
and
a
light
caramel
sweetness
and
not

else
really
nothing
special

great
color
and
very
refreshing
taste
not
much
of
a
smell
but
very
light
and
good
drinkable
bottle
has
a
nice
design
too
if
it
didnt
have
the
off
flavor
in
the
finish
this
would
be
quite
a
good
brew
indeed
very
mild
but
very
good
pale
ale
not
super
hoppy
or
super
malty
very
well
made
beer
very
boring
beer
not
very
hoppy
or
flavorful
would
buy
these
for
a
large
gathering
if
youre
having
a
lot
of
people
for
a
bbq
or
want
a
decent
beer
thats
not
a
light
beer
pours
a
dark
clear
golden
color
with
average
head
and
damn
nice
clingy
lacing
aroma
is
light
with
touches
of
malt
and
some
citrusy
hops
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
this
beer
is
very
light
and
subdued
the
maltiness
seems
to
be
more
of
the
hero
here
but
some
of
the
hops
and
a
small
amount
of
citrus
do
come
out
this
was
not
what
i
expected
from
a
pale
ale
but
not
too
bad
27
home
bottle
decent
shiner
offering
somewhat
strong
but
a
bit
bland
for
an
pale
ale
better
than
their
standard
offerings
and
would
have
again
if
given
the
chance
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
decent
malts
decent

a

would

if
categorized

i
dont

ill
come
back
to
this
one
anytime
soon
holds
its
own
the
top
tier
pale

shiner
didnt
fail
with
its
pale
ale
should
be
a
safe
bet
for
almost
anyone
craft
drinkers
will
appreciate
that
its
smooth
and
has
solid
flavor
and
people
used
to
fizzy
north
american
brews
will
appreciate
that
its
not
too
terribly
strong
pours
a
pretty
reddishorange
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
foamycreamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
sheet
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
which
surprised
me
actually
the
aroma
is
of
malts
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
but
was
pretty
smooth
and
went
down
easy
unlike
many
pale
ales
just
a
very
slight
taste
of
hops
for
the
finish
but
was
gone
in
a
few
seconds
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
very
tasty
and
really
liked
this
one
picked
up
one
of
spoetzls
mixed
six
pack
and
this
was
included
poured
out
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
decent
offwhite
head
with
nice
lacing
the
color
was
a
dark
amber
or
light
brown
slight
aroma
mostly
of
malt
the
taste
is
pleasant
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
and
very
slight
hops
taste
according
to
the
label
they
use
munich
malts
and
u
s
golding
bravo
hops
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
pale
ale
light
fine
for
the
times
you
dont
want
a
strongly
flavored
ale
its
definitely
not
retired
i
have
seen
it
in
all
the
mixed
six
packs
from
spoetzl
two
things
1
this
pale
ale
is
not
retired
and
2
it
is
actually
a
quality
pale
ale
well
done
shiner
overall
this
beer
was
okay
its
not
going
to
be
a
goto
beer
or
anything
like
that
but
it
was
good
id
much
rather
have
a
shiner
than
something
like
coors
or
miller
or
anything
like
that
i
drank
this
beer
straight
out
of
the
glass
bottle
in
the
end
this
beer
is
just
an
average
at
best
or
slightly
above
average
beer
o
nothing
great
about
this
beer
might
be
why
its
retired
easy
drinker
and
nothing
complex
about
it
floral
for
texas
or
apa
more
going
on
that
the
current
crop
of
reviews
reveals
worth
a
try
all
made
in
shiner
tx
pretty
weak
pale
ale
not
very
hoppy
taste
at
all
and
no
real
hints
of
citrus
or
anything
else
smoothdrinking
but
i
like
my
ipa
stronger
with
a
heavier
hoppy
flavor
typical
of
a
shiner
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
nice
caramel
mix
with
pale
malt
nothing
groundbreaking
here
a
solid
slightly
above
average
apa
that
is
easy
to
drink
lots
of
caramel
flavor
very
little
hop
id
say
this
is
too
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
rich

lowly
carbonated

overall
an
ok
take
on
an

pale
ale
what
happened
when
while
the
lady
was
gardening
she
bent
over
to
pull
up
some
carrots
that
a
rabbit
had
already
set
its
sights
on
she
got
a
wild
hare
up
her
ass
i
simply
unscrewed
the
top
on
mine
and
held
it
upside
down
by
its
back
legs
in
order
to
skin
it
it
tried
to
rabbit
on
me
but
i
am
wise
to
those
sorts
of
tricks
so
i
held
tightly
to
its
tail
until
it
settled
down
the
pseudocascade
formed
three
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
that
slowly
fell
leaving
behind
some
great
lacing
color
was

deep

mediocre
i
generally
like
shiner
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
bitter
hops
is
all
that
is
here
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
golden
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
two
fingers
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
its
pretty
good
looking
though
with
maybe
a
bit
too
much
head
formation
scents
of
bready
malt
light
fruity
esters
reminiscent
of
apple
light
notes
of
tangerine
flesh
and
a
light
level
of
floral
and
grassy
hop
aromas
malty
and
delicate
with
a
low
level
of
hop
aromas
and
a
moderate
level
of
fruity
esters
overall
far
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
than
an
american
flavor
begins
with
notes
of
bready
biscuity
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
mediumlight
floral
hop
flavors
this
moves
into
a
slightly
drier
yet
still
lightly
sweet
middle
with
a
moderate
level
of
floral
hop
flavor
a
touch
of
applelike
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
finish
lightly
dry
with
moderate
flavors
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
a
light
touch
of
apple
and
a
bit
of
orange
peel
aftertaste
is
dry
with
notes
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
and
biscuity
malt
the
flavor
profile
is
balanced
and
not
overly
hoppy
with
flavors
most
resembling
an
english
pale
or
an
older
style
american
not
groundbreaking
but
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
nicely
drinkable
and
true
to
style
overall
this
is
a
serviceable
pale
ale
its
balanced
in
flavor
and
aroma
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
not
the
hoppiest
or
the
most
experimental
american
pale
around
nor
is
it
the
best
simple
pale
ale
but
its
good
in
its
own
way
appearance
darker
than
i
am
used
to
for
a
pale
ale
pleasant
amber
color
with
a
nice
fingerworth
of
head
smell
not
much
to
it
for
me
some
malts
and
grains
and
some
hops
as
well
tastemouthfeel
kind
of
fruitycitrusy
with
a
definite
presence
of
hops
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
ipas
and
this
one
to
me
was
moodle
of
the
road
overall
it
was
tasty
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
my
impression
is
that
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
nothing
negative
in
it
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
that
it
seems
a
touch
watered
down
like
it
is
close
to
being
very
flavorful
then
they
got
a
bit
timid
and
scaled
it
back
had
they
just
allowed
the
flavors
to
fully
emerge
this
would
have
been
a
standout
still
it
is
pleasant
enough
and
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
clear
light
amber
pour
with
a
small
head
and
light
carbonation
nice
grainy
aroma
flavor
is
pretty
basic
with
a
bit
of
sweet
and
bready
malt
backed
by
a
light
grassy
hop
bitterness
with
just
a
hint
of
grapefruit
crisp
finish
very
basic
not
bad
but
nothing
stands
out
to
make
me
want
another
i
really
did
not
like
this
one
upon
reading
reviews
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
i
love
fruity
beers
but
i
got
no
fruit
flavor
what
so
ever
i
was
very
disappointed
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
looked
exactly
how
a
beer
is
supposed
to
look
nice
amber
color
taste
at
first
was
kind
of
rotton
but
it
got
to
tasting
a
bit
bitter
after
that
i
just
did
not
care
for
it
at
all
i
finished
it
out
of
obligation
not
to
waste
it
honestly
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
an
ok
beer
overall
but
there
are
several
other
choices
in
the
style
that
are
better
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
decent
sized
but
short
lived
off
white
head
aromas
of
bread
and
light
caramel
maltiness
with
hints
of
fruit
and
earthy
hops
the
flavor
holds
more
earthy
hop
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggested
backed
up
by
a
solid
bready
caramel
malt
base
and
lots
of
sugary
fruitiness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
pale
ale
but
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
nothing
flawed
but
a
bit
boring
cheers
my
favorite
of
the
shiner
series
recently
released
in
ct
nice
hazy
yellow
color
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
hop
to
it
and
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
lot
of
pine
notes
and
a
very
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
for
a
pale
ale
but
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
notes
nice
label
retro
deep
golden
light
amber
in
color
creamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
better
than
average
lacing
aroma
of
malt
and
hop
gently
sweet
bready
slightly
caramelish
malt
and
leafygrassyfloral
hops
quite
english
in
nature
hopwise
not
what
i
think
of
as
american
and
european
in
malt
but
again
not
american
overall
balanced
a
bit
too
far
towards
sweet
malt
the
hops
are
nice
pleasantly
floral
against
the
sweetbready
malt
easygoing
basic
pale
ale
thats
got
enough
to
satisfy
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
i
would
seek
out
again
purchased
as
part
of
a
variety
six
pack
for
about

this
was
a
good
beer
nothing
too
outstanding
but
also
nothing
very
awful
a
very
good
ale
for
a
pretty
good
price
too
overall
not
perfectly
balanced
but
a
decent
and
enjoyable
ale
pours
a
beautiful
redish
amber
pillowy
head
two
finger
plus
settles
to
an
attractive
short
head
with
impressive
lacing
not
much
noticeable
about
the
aroma
pretty
neutral
clean
taste
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
nicely
hopped
clean
crisp
finish
silky
smooth
on
the
palette
very
pleasing
mouth
feel
a
good
ale
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
o
i
understand
why
other
people
dont
rate
this
highly
because
its
not
trendy
in
the
pale
ale
style
its
subdued
its
wet
with
a
hint
of
dryness
its
quite
good
if
youre
not
looking
for
the
modern
big
pale
ale
its
good
but
mellow
for
the
style
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
very
good
mix
of
flavors
and
very
well
balance
worth
looking
for
o
too
sweet
tastes
sugared
up
or
flavored
but
not
to
the
point
of
undrinkability
definitely
a
gateway
beer
at
best
for
theres
more
sweet
here
than
anything
and
next
to
no
hop
presence
almost
more
of
a
bad
imitation
of
an
english
pale
than
anything
like
an
american
pale
overall
not
bad
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
ive
done
my
share
of
bashing
on
shiner
we
all
have
but
ive
had
three
solid
beers
from
them
lately
so
it
time
for
reassessment
yeah
this
pale
ale
isnt
zombie
dust
but
its
pretty
darn
good
clear
amber
tinted
pale
beer
with
a
passable
white
head
the
nose
is
citrusy
hops
light
and
fruity
with
very
little
bitter
slightly
richer
malt
profile
gives
some
body
the
hops
really
shine
in
the
flavor
really
citrusy
lemons
and
limes
even
its
quite
a
nice
surprise
malt
supports
it
with
a
touch
of
english
sweetness
but
the
finish
is
clean
almost
like
a
lager
a
delicious
combination
highly
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
shiner
brand
brews
ive
gotten
into
a
six
of
this
on
a
hot
day
would
be
enjoyable
work
time
to
give
shine
another
chance
folks
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
medicinal
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
yeast
and
earthy
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
but
the
yeast
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
somewhat
dominate
things
in
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
a
bit
of
fruit
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
coming
first
mild
bitterness
strong
malt
backbone
at
the
finish
a
touch
of
fruit
is
there
as
well
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
its
a
light
ale
lacks
any
strong
flavors
which
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
i
am
typically
quick
to
judge
but
have
learned
when
tasting
beer
to
give
the
chosen
brew
a
chance
to
grow
on
me
shiner
wild
hare
pale
ale
did
just
that
at
first
taste
i
was
slightly
taken
back
by
the
strong
citrus
and
harsh
hops
but
in
the
end
this
beer
shined
as
a
wellbalanced
beer
perfect
for
the
fall

overall
a
good
session
beer
tasty
with
good
balance
carry
on
citizens
c
enjoyable
pale
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
one
too
sweet
and
not
enough
hops
is
a
death
knell
for
me
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
definitely
has
flavor
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
once
the
beer
warmed
up
the
floral
and
piney
flavors
that
are
often
found
in
ipas
became
much
more
present
i
wish
the
carbonation
wasnt
so
strong
and
that
the
head
was
more
consistent
but
other
then
that
it
was
enjoyable
the
lacing
did
not
stay
throughout
the
whole
time
and
the
beer
eventually
looked
like
i
had
some
apple
juice
in
my
glass
o
overall
a
basic
but
refreshing
pale
ale
with
some
minor
flaws
not
bad
overall
i
will
never
drink
this
again
shiner
wild
hare
pale
may
as
the
brewery
advertises
have
assertive
aromas
and
hoppy
brightness
to
drinkers
that
have
only
ever
known
commercial
lagers
but
anyone
whos
accustomed
to
truer
better
brewed
examples
of
the
style
will
find
it
unsatisfying
and
lackluster
that
was
my
impression
anyhow
not
something
i
care
to
drink
again
this
is
quite
a
nice
apa
from
the
shiner
brand
it
may
not
be
an
intensely
hoppy
apa
that
everyone
loves
to
rave
about
but
this
is
a
solid
highly
drinkable
flavorful
balanced
beer
that
has
just
enough
hop
character
to
keep
you
interested
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
this
is
a
beer
i
could
definitely
knock
back
sourcing
purchased
at
heb
in
texas
in
july
of
2013
for

notes
and

carbonation
on
the
palate
finishes
with

yeasty
light
floral

with

an
good
session

not
a
bad
apa
however
i
havent
had
many
and
my
rating
may
change
as
i
find
better
ones
out
there
i
did
enjoy
this
and
shiner
was
surprisingly
unafraid
to
let
their
hop
characteristics
shine
through
strong
here

overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pale

quite
pleasant
in
flavor
and
balance
but
lacking
in
some
aspects
an
enjoyable
offering
pretty
uninspiring
apa
would
work
in
a
pinch
but
truly
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
am
not
sure
what
the
problem
is
with
this
beer
the
people
who
wrote
the
labels
never
drank
it
or
the
people
who
make
it
dont
know
how
to
brew
it
claims
to
be
a
classic
american
pale
ale
with
a
golden
color
i
will
have
to
recheck
the
color
but
it
seems
more
medium
to
dark
amber
than
golden
from
memory
and
classic
pale
ale
no
it
has
a
yeasty
sourness
to
it
that
i
do
not
associate
with
a
classic
pale
ale
now
you
call
it
a
saisson
and
all
the
foo
foo
belgian
snobs
will
give
it
a
4
5
maybe
that
is
just
showing
my
anti
saisson
snobbishness
anyway
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
can
handle
the
sourness
and
it
could
be
a
great
bargain
as
the
people
truly
looking
for
a
classic
american
pale
ale
stay
away
and
shiner
cuts
the
price
to
sell
the
stuff
of
course
if
the
people
at
shiner
really
cant
keep
the
yeasties
out
of
their
ale
when
they
want
to
youll
just
be
taking
your
chances
with
this
if
you
like
hops
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
first
impression
is
a
very
floral
aromatic
hop
aroma
that
is
counterbalanced
by
a
much
more
restrained
maltiness
nice
amber
color
and
head
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
kudos
to
spoetzl
for
brewing
a
beer
that
delivers
on
hop
flavor
without
the
overkill
of
many
ipas
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
wasnt
overall
crazy
about
the
flavor
of
the
hop
profile
pours
a
hazy
orangish
brown
with
a
medium
off
white
head
aromas
of
molasses
and
grain
taste
begins
with
some
plums
then
some
oatmeal
and
a
slightly
salty
earthy
finish
decent
mouthfeel
overall
a
below
average
pale
ale
one
of
shiners
weaker
offerings
imo
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
light
copperbrass
color
with
a
thin
quick
to
fade
white
head
atop
a
decent
shot
of
floral
hops
mixed
with
some
caramelbiscuit
malts
with
neither
winning
out
over
the
other
the
hops
dont
show
much
presence
on
the
palate
with
mainly
lithly
toasted
biscuit
malt
flavors
the
feel
is
pretty
light
and
ho
hum
eh
it
goes
down
easy
but
there
are
better
no
brainer
beers
to
be
had
out
there
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
well
retaining
white
head
that
leaves
some
good
lace
on
the
pint
aroma
of
caramel
and
floral
hop
in
the
taste
light
caramel
and
bitter
earthy
hops
a
little
bread
and
then
finishes
with
a
grassy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
a
bit
watery
carbonation
is
good
overall
this
is
about
average
for
an
american
pale
par
for
the
course
overall
im
sort
of
impressed
what
it
lacks
in
aroma
and
body
is
quickly
made
up
by
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
quenchabilitybitterness
for
a
shiner
product
it
exceeded
my
expectations
and
certainly
has
a
wild
hair
sic
this
pours
a
semicloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
aroma
has
a
weak
scent
of
grains
and
yeast
that
is
overtaken
by
the
smell
of
hops
the
taste
is
kind
of
unique
for
a
pale
ale
as
it
has
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
to
the
hops
drinks
a
little
more
like
a
spiced
beer
than
a
pale
ale
to
me
drinkable

fairly
decent

the

the

were
too
much
of
a
secondary
feature
for
an
american
pale

drinkability
it
is
a
decent
brew
and
offers
a
nice
spiciness
however
that
is
really
not
what
i
expect
from
this
style
a
malty
sweetness
odd
flavor
for
a
apa
in
a
good
way
if
this
was
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
have
thought
i
was
drinking
a
wheat
beer
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
to
heavy
mouth
feel
it
had
a
slightly
dry
sweet
orange
finnish
i
would
have
another
its
not
bad
at
all
i
could
buy
a
sixer
of
it
and
drink
them
all
without
complaint
i
dont
think
its
world
class
but
its
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
a
good
effort
hopefully
spoetzl
will
keep
trying
new
and
bolder
beers
over
time
overall
for
a
pale
ale
its
very
malty
almost
to
a
fault
but
there
isnt
any
particularly
bad
about
it
at
the
very
least
its
worth
checking
out
but
be
prepared
for
a
decent
but
imbalanced
flavor
i
could
go
for
a
dish
of
wild
hare
about
now
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
light
bo
and
i
checked
its
not
mine
biscuit
and
funky
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
minus
the
bo
of
course
with
a
slightly
more
pronounced
orange
character
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
an
uninspired
pale
its
not
really
bad
per
se
but
its
not
very
good
either
average
at
best
had
this
on
tap
at
a
casino
not
a
bad
looking
beer
at
all
but
average
in
smell
and
taste
had
a
nice
head
on
it
with
very
little
lacing
the
flavor
was
kind
of
a
generic
pale
ale
for
me
but
most
brews
from
this
brewer
all
seem
like
a
good
idea
that
someone
just
stopped
short
on
it
was
free
so
i
wont
complain
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
myself
rjt
o
this
is
an
okay
pale
ale
it
is
an
inexpensive
brew
with
the
potential
to
be
a
gateway
beer
overall
drinkability
for
a
beer
from
texas
this
is
not
a
beer
to
drink
cold
or
at
least
not
for
me
anyway
cold
its
offputting
the
smell
and
the
taste
made
me
think
it
was
way
past
due
but
as
it
warmed
up
more
of
its
charm
came
out
it
grew
on
me
but
i
think
that
was
because
it
was
so
bad
at
first
and
as
it
got
better
i
did
a
bit
of
oh
thank
god
i
wont
have
to
drainpour
this
its
not
so
bad
after
all
but
thats
not
a
good
way
to
start
a
beer
its
not
your
typical
apa
once
warm
its
just
above
average
but
before
that
its
a
beer
to
avoid
i
do
wonder
if
this
beer
is
a
bit
old
but
no
way
of
knowing
so
overall
its
just
okay
if
warm
drinkability
one
is
enough
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
am
very
impressed

tiankfully

to
the
beer
this
could
have
been
more

as
a

beer
it
suffices
only
lovers
of
shiner
or
this
style
should
give
it
a
go
wild
hare
may
not
be
the
most
flavorful
american
pale
ale
but
it
really
isnt
bad
and
i
am
convinced
that
most
people
will
find
that
it
does
meet
their
minimum
standards
it
is
priced
lower
than
most
apa
also
and
is
widely
available
for
a
craft

semi

try
it

if
youre
used
to
drinking
standard

like
budweiser
or
coors
i
like
blue

and
sierra

pale

and
this
one
is
on
par
with
those
brews
anything
from
shiner
is
good
a

brew
its
an

not
an

even
for
that
it

it

brew
may
be
biased
poured
a
coppery

tone
with
a
smallish
white

get
something
of

coming
off
this
one
in

to
the

claims
there
is
both

the
amlt
characteristics
are
more

than
i
would
have
thought
i
probably
had
built
up
in

it
wasnt

great
the

pond
i
revisited
in

was

when
in

you
gotta
go

have

overall
this
is
a

big

not

a
pretty

dont

theres

faint
i
struggled
to
pick
anything
up
maybe
like
orange
juice
not
quite
a
fresh
citrus
smell
but
more
like
a
juiced
concentrate
scent
tastes
similar
with
a
faint
orange
juice
flavor
which
is
lost
under
a
malt
bill
more
towards
an
amber
ale
felt
like
this
was
a
pretty
onedimensional
brew
insert
wild
hare
replaced
by
a
tame
bunny
joke
here
overall
this
is
an
average
pale
ale
a
bit
more
flavor
could
have
done
wonders
for
it
but
it
is
honestly
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
still
a
decent
cheap
beer
for
summer
days
and
i
see
it
has
a
modest
abv
so
thats
not
so
bad
o
to
be
quite
honest
im
confused
on
why
spoetzl
mirrored
great
divides
labeling
and
design
the
beer
is
not
all
that
wild
and
im
disappointed
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
above
average
pale
ale
that
fell
somewhere
between
the
english
and
american
styles
but
was
still
pretty
flavorful
and
very
easy
drinking
this
bottled
tasted
pretty
fresh
which
i
think
was
key
to
my
overall
enjoyment
of
it
id
definitely
have
another
o
decent
but
pretty
one
dimensional
flavors
are
subtle
and
not
overly
impressive
i
really
expected
more
from
this
but
it
seems
to
come
off
as
cheap
o
shiners
wild
hare
is
certainly
not
something
id
have
the
dog
fetch
but
its
also
not
offensive
the
oddities
in
the
aroma
seem
to
disappear
but
the
flavor
is
quite
candidly
weak
in
hoppiness
something
shiner
cant
afford
to
have
going
on
with
the
strong
competition
in
the
market
refreshing
nonetheless
wild
hare
would
make
for
a
good
lawnmower
beer
just
a
little
beefier
than
the
standard
lager
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
solid
brew
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
tastes
just
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
it
does
in
the
glass
so
perfect
for
parties
with
no
proper
glassware
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
light
copper
with
an
eggshell
colored
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
there
is
a
citrus
smell
due
to
the
hops
the
aroma
is
fairly
mild
but
pleasant
the
flavor
is
sweet
from
the
malts
the
hop
flavors
add
some
bitterness
as
well
as
some
citrus
the
aftertaste
is
not
strong
theres
a
metallic
taste
that
is
almost
typical
of
shiner
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
solid
effort
from
shiner
heres
to
103
years
o
not
bad
for
their
first
apa
easy
enough
to
drink
the
six
pack
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
there
was
a
mineral
presence
like
i
pick
up
in
samuel
smith
beers
maybe
from
the
water
used
i
went
into
this
with
high
hopes
for
some
reason
it
wasnt
as
good
as
id
hoped
everything
happens
right
of
the
top
and
then
just
washes
out
clear
orange
thin
white
head
that
leaves
sparse
patches
of
lace
prominent
bread
crust
malt
with
a
kiss
of
caramel
orange
peel
and
herbs
form
the
light
hop
profile
clean
and
crisp
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
shiner
an
easy
drinking
ale
with
broad
appeal
o
decent
pale
ale
maybe
a
higher
rating
than
it
deserves
when
compared
to
world
class
ales
but
a
step
up
from
the
regular
shiner
lineup
overall
one
of
the
better
ones
from
shiner
in
a
while
despite
not
living
up
to
the
style
but
shiner
bock
is
one
of
my
favs
despite
its
own
shortcomings
ill
get
this
again
o
overall
it
is
not
bad
i
guess
its
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
if
i
wasnt
from
texas
and
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
spoetzl
brewery
i
would
not
be
happy
with
my
purchase
the
beer
pours
a
medium
orangeamber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
quite
floral
with
some
bread
notes
also
mixed
in
i
also
get
some
orange
citrus
and
perfume
notes
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
full
of
bread
and
toffee
with
some
floral
and
perfume
notes
the
beer
has
very
little
bitterness
and
the
floral
notes
are
quite
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
could
taste
malt
and
spice
with
a
nicely
balanced
hop
finish
i
have
tried
most
of
shiners
offerings
and
this
may
be
their
most
flavorful
to
date
this
pale
ale
is
very
easy
to
drink
yet
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
i
would
not
say
this
is
among
the
very
best
among
this
type
i
have
tried
but
shiner
has
a
good
effort
with
wild
hare
pale
ale
refreshing
with
a
good
light
body
and
carbonation
balanced
and
drinkable
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
bread
and
caramel
malts
light
hops
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
okay
better
than
most
shiner
products
but
less
than
many
apa
caramel
light
hops
bread
malts
overall
a
nice
session
or
lawn
mower
beer
but
a
pretty
timid
apa
glad
to
see
shiner
trying
seasonals
and
experimenting
a
bit
but
they
dont
stray
too
far
from
the
shallow
end
of
the
pool
nothing
wrong
here
just
doesnt
wow
me
much
lightmedium
bodied
medium
carbonation
just
a
little
dryness
in
the
palate
tastes
like
barely
competent
homebrew
overall
this
is
a
very
unremarkable
beer
im
a
p1
of
shiner
bock
my
goto
on
the
golf
course
but
wild
hare
comes
up
a
little
empty
for
me
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
particularly
memorable
either
id
drink
another
if
offered
but
im
not
going
in
search
of
another
bottle
either
mf
a
nice
moderate
body
and
the
heavy
carbonation
lets
the
flavors
as
bad
as
they
may
be
linger
for
a
little
while
so
overall
its
pretty
decent
id
buy
this
beer
on
occasion
and
ill
be
looking
forward
to
their
next
adventure
too
o
after
the
reviews
and
word
of
mouth
i
was
greatly
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
call
it
a
nice
effort
by
shiner
and
a
welcome
new
direction
in
pale
ales
the
mouthfeel
gets
it
a
little
bit
right
with
finally
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
combined
with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
a
mild
bodied
texture
you
have
a
forgettable
session
beer
i
wish
there
was
more
to
this
but
overall
its
a
drinkable
disappointment
happy
to
see
it
as
it
might
push
more
mundane
beer
drinkers
towards
superior
beverages
but
overall
its
a
pass
what
is
with
the
fruity
yeast
going
on
here
it
is
the
red
delicious
of
the
apple
world
milly
mushy
and
makes
you
want
to
throw
it
at
a
car
i
know
it
is
shiners
first
ale
and
all
but
really
did
you
have
to
let
the
yeast
run
this
rampant
the
bitterness
is
there
but
where
is
the
hop
flavor
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
nice
moderately
priced
beer
to
quaff
on
through
the
summer
months
here
no
that
will
not
be
happening
this
is
a
bad
example
of
a
pale
ale
reminds
me
of
the
saranac
lineup
i
had
over
the
holidays
o
very
easy
going
ipa
ive
seen
and
heard
people
judge
it
like
a
commercial
ipa
but
i
appreciate
the
sentiment
to
step
outside
the
box
for
a
typically
german
brewing
company
i
would
liken
it
most
to
the
analogy
of
molsonbudweisersierra
nevada
ipawild
hare
there
is
obviously
a
difference
but
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
one
way
or
the
other
o
my
roommate
brought
this
home
and
i
thought
that
maybe
shiner
was
going
to
make
something
a
little
more
craft
but
then
i
poured
the
bottle
into
the
glass
will
not
be
buying
ever
glad
i
didnt
this
time
my
full
review

if
youre
someone
who
enjoys
pale
ales
you
wont
think
much
of
this
beer
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
hoppy
and
complex
than
your
miller
high
life
this
is
the
beer
for
you
goldenbrown
in
appearance
with
a
good
2
finger
head
after
pour
with
excellent
lacing
you
can
definitely
smell
the
hops
with
tones
of
floral
and
citrus
its
pretty
mellow
but
you
get
a
nice
bite
and
hoppy
character
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
overall
excited
about
shiners
first
pale
ale
it
seems
that
shiner
is
starting
to
get
more
creative
and
coming
out
with
more
complex
beers
but
overall
this
is
an
epic
failure
solid
shiner
solid
pretty
honey
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
afloat
on
top
what
a
beeeewteefull
smell
of
hoppiness
no
too
much
not
too
little
but
right
on
the
money
for
a
pale
ale
goldilocks
just
enough
malty
backbone
mixed
with
the
citrusy
im
sick
of
hearingcitrusy
but
it
applies
here
sturdy
mouthfeel
wo
feeling
like
your
drinking
cotton
balls
mostly
clean
finish
with
a
little
syrupy
residue
but
its
fine
just
fine
i
like
it
shiner
now
go
fix
your
bock
thank
you
shiner
overall
this
is
typical
spoetzl
all
hype
and
no
delivery
i
was
told
that
this
is
gunna
be
one
of
their
best
beers
yet
and
i
have
yet
to
find
one
i
really
like
there
is
just
way
too
much
malt
and
sweetness
oh
stone

how
things
have
changed
o
this
was
a
good
beer
it
was
expensive
but
it
was
obvious
they
really
took
their
time
you
want
to
impress
somebody
with
a
good
pale
ale
this
is
a
top
contender
imo
cheers
i
havent
drank
this
in
years
but
its
impending
cancellation
spurred
me
to
revisit
amber
color
good
head
aroma
is
pretty
nice
a
bready
maltiness
that
almost
seems
english
until
you
taste
it
more
malt
in
the
flavor
and
a
crisp
slight
hop
touch
this
is
my
go
to
beer
very
flavorful
and
crisp
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
anytime
in
matter
of
fact
if
you
want
a
good
beer
look
no
further
maybe
i
just
wasnt
expecting
these
flavors
in
a
pale
ale
but
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
the
first
i
have
had
in
a
while
that
i
know
i
wont
buy
again
i
might
try
the
2

when
it
comes
out
to
see
how
stone

flavors
and
very

to

a
very

offering
really
amazing
pale
ale
i
could
drink
this
all
day
took
me
a
few
sips
to
really
get
into
the
taste
because
im
more
of
a
hop
head
but
i
really
like
it
o
a
nice
hoppy
yet
balanced
pale
ale
ideal
for
ipa
drinkers
who
want
a
slightly
more
sessionable
option
almost
no
smell
at
all
great
steady
everyday
pale
ale
overall
i
am
impressed
by
how
malt
forward
this
is
especially
compared
to
the
rest
of
stones
offerings
anyone
who
is
fond
of
maltforward
amber
ales
will
love
this
balanced
pale
ale
not
like
an
apa
that
is
more
like
an
ipa
but
with
less
body
it
is
maltier
but
still
bitter
and
spicer
they
kept
their
original
recipe
almost
20
years
ago
and
those
were
different
times
that
said
it
is
not
that
tamed
compared
to
old
school
an
odd
beer
for
stone
you
think
theyd
want
to
make
the
hoppiest
pale
ale
of
all
time
but
instead
they
made
what
might
be
the
maltiest
those
tricksters
this
is
a
nice
mellow
sessionable
pale
ale
much
more
in
the
english
style
than
in
the
super
hoppy
american
style
which
was
a
surprise
considering
stones
other
stuff
overall
mmmm
good
apa
by
a
stellar
company
what
more
could
one
ask
for
dark
amber
tan
head
not
a
fan
of
the
mild
body
mixed
with
cough
syrup
taste
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
its
a
stone
but
wouldnt
order
it
again
flavor
follows
smell
more
medium
malt
and
perhaps
more
hops
than
the
average
apa
overall
a
really
good
pale
ale
nice
flavor
i
would
drink
this
often
overall
very
thick
spicy
chewy
reminds
me
of
a
rogue
beer
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
amber
body
with
a
half
finger
of
offwhite
head
golden
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
nice
trickle
of
bubbles
a
very
good
looking
pale
ale
scents
of
pine
resin
wet
earthy
herbal
hops
floral
jasminelike
hops
a
hint
of
tangerine
a
bit
of
pale
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
in
the
background
a
nice
hop
forward
aroma
that
leans
less
towards
citrus
and
more
to
resiny
floral
and
earthy
aromas
with
a
nice
balancing
malt
flavor
begins
with
notes
of
pine
resin
and
earthy
herbal
hops
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
low
level
of
malt
sweetness
this
moves
into
a
more
bitter
middle
with
notes
of
pine
resin
earthy
herbal
hops
floral
hops
hints
of
grapefruit
peel
and
a
touch
of
pale

a
good
hop
forward
flavor
profile
that
uses
its
light
malt
presence
to
keep
the
flavor
from
becoming
too
bitter
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
very
nice
and
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
its
hoppy
yet
not
overly
so
aromatic
flavor
and
smooth
its
a
nice
simple
drinking
experience
and
quite
good
mind
you
im
just
not
that
fond
of
hops
so
this
may
appeal
to
those
that
are
go
figure
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
with
well
hidden
alcohol
it
is
flavorful
and
must
have
been
pretty
intense
when
it
was
initially
released
though
there
are
a
lot
of
very
flavorful
beers
in
the
apa
style
now
available
and
this
one
is
not
quite
as
intense
as
some
of
the
newer
entrants
medium
carbonation
and
goes
down
very
smooth
there
are
better
american
pales
but
this
is
just
good
enough
that
ill
likely
try
it
again
i
like
the
grain
notes
it
almost
has
an
anchor
steam
feel
with
the
toasted
grain
taste
mouthfeel
enjoyable
o
balanced
feel
and
taste
not
over
powering
in
any
way
but
still
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
character
something
to
drink
when
im
tired
of
ipas
o
pale
ales
in
all
honesty
are
not
my
style
i
prefer
much
brasher
flavors
that
favor
one
side
rather
than
being
perfectly
balanced
even
with
that
being
said
stone
with
their
pale
ale
delivers
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
that
proves
that
not
all
of
their
beers
will
send
the
faint
of
heart
cowering
away
with
their
tail
between
their
legs
a
wonderfully
balanced
brew
that
drinks
extremely
easily
as
has
become
a
topcontender
for
my
summertime
session
choice
i
look
forward
to
spending
many
nights
with
friends
on
my
couch
a
bottle
of
this
in
my
glass
and
the
phillies
on
my
tube
far
more
malty
than
anticipated
and
the
hop
character
lacks
typical
west
coast
flavoring
the
bitterness
is
spoton
for
stone
which
doesnt
jive
with
my
palate
love
the
malt
character
and
flavoring
hops
were
decent
but
too
bitter
for
me
nice
drinkable
pale
ale
crisp
and
refreshing
i
was
expecting
more
hops
from
the
folks
over
at
stone
that
being
said
this
brew
is
delecious
outstanding
color
a
deep
copperamberish
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
head
on
this
beer
is
outstanding
very
much
like
that
on
sierra
nevadas
celebration
ale
i
prefer
this
to
stones
ipa
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bit
more
complex
and
balanced
with
the
malts
coming
through
and
not
so
hop
dominated
very
nice
overall
this
hit
the
spot
and
delivered
on
expectations
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
sediment
adds
to
the
appearance
and
flavor
similar
to
ipa
but
not
there
yet
as
it
should
be
i
would
definitely
have
again
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass

nice
pour
into
pint
glass
fairly
dark
in
color
amber
brown
lots
of
floating

unfiltered
look
fluffy
head
nice
sticky
lacing
good

on

some
juicy
citrus
and
grapefruity
hops
good
bite
in
the
finish
well
rounded
good
texture
light
but
full
juicy
pretty
delicious
o
have
not
had
this
since
i
started
drinking
craft
over
two
years
ago
its
a
very
solid
sessionable
pale
ale
offering
and
one
i
would
revisit
in
the
future
a
wonder
must
try
a
favorite
this
apa
from
stone
pours
a
rich
copper
amber
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
few
minutes
and
resolves
to
a
gentle
white
film
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
well
balanced
between
malty
sweet
and
hoppy
bitter
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
very
very
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
no
particular
notes
sticking
out
just
smooth
enjoyable
well
crafted
beer
this
is
not
like
the
in
your
face
beers
i
have
come
to
love
and
expect
from
stone
but
it
us
an
incredibly
well
made
and
crafted
ale
one
of
the
best
apas
iive
had
o
ill
try
it
again
within
the
freshness
window
and
rereview
as
is
far
from
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
light
for
stone
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
intro
to
stone
but
for
those
not
as
fond
of
bold
hops
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
but
i
expected
something
hoppier
from
stone
i
would
how
far
out
they
date
this
beer
if
it
started
any
hoppier
o
realized
this
one
was
past
the
date
after
the
tasting
still
drinkable
although
not
at
all
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
also
a
worthwhile
experience
to
blindly
compare
fresh
and
not
so
fresh
pale
ales
to
hone
ones
palate
im
a
lot
better
about
checking
dates
now
overall
pretty
standard
pale
ala
was
expecting
more
hops
from
these
guys
but
wondering
where
they
went
when
compared
with
beers
in
their
portfolio
not
maybe
the
best
purchase
now
i
have
seen
the
date
and
has
not
kept
as
well
as
its
higher
abv
brothers
i
have
tried
solid
o
a
subtle
pale
ale
that
has
a
good
balance
of
flavor
o
a
really
good
pale
ale
nothing
really
blows
you
away
but
its
just
good
all
around
o
i
will
probably
buy
this
one
again
it
really
surprised
me
though
because
i
wasnt
expecting
the
hops
to
come
through
like
they
do
i
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
much
at
first
but
the
more
i
drink
it
its
quite
good
not
as
balanced
as
it
probably
could
be
but
i
think
thats
the
style
that
stone
was
going
for
with
this
one
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
little
bite
i
recommend
oh
and
the
bottles
are
pretty
sweet
too
this
beer
is
unbalanced
and
i
would
not
drink
it
unless
it
was
the
last
beer
in
the
planet
overall
this
is
a
delicious
pale
ale
that
has
substance
nuance
and
flavorful
hoppiness
while
i
like
that
it
is
comfortable
being
a
pale
ale
better
examples
of
the
style
are
more
creative
here
we
have
another
west
coast
pale
that
doesnt
have
enough
balance
to
make
it
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
much
better
examples
of
the
style
exist
bells
twohearted
and
three
floyds
zombie
dust
to
name
a
few
overall
drinkability
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
beer
full
flavored
and
loaded
with
good
aroma
i
could
drink
another
one
easily
if
i
had
one
went
great
with
food
mexican
bean
salsa
polenta
casserole
and
i
know
it
would
be
good
all
by
itself
i
agree
with
the
back
of
the
bottle
probably
exceedingly
bold
for
its
day
but
not
mega
hoppy
by
todays
standards
that
being
said
really
well
done
and
still
a
very
good
beer
that
accentuates
the
hops
but
isnt
excessively
bitter
well
done
o
a
classic
modern
american
style
pale
ale
in
that
it
is
on
the
whole
more
hop
than
malt
dominated
some
balance
but
it
is
the
hops
which
stand
out
extremely
sessionable
you
do
want
more
after
its
gone
wondering
if
the
low
marks
and
references
to
maltiness
in
some
reviews
here
are
the
result
of
aged
bottles
not
my
experience
at
all
a
decent
beer
nothing
unpleasant
but
not
necessarily
anything
exciting
either
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
its
not
hard
to
drink
just
doesnt
look
or
taste
like
a
pale
ale
from
california
o
not
necessarily
spectacular
in
my
opinion
but
about
as
solid
as
an
apa
gets
not
as
bold
as
i
am
accustomed
to
with
stone
but
a
sure
fire
go
to
brew
when
you
want
something
for
any
occasion
without
breaking
the
bank
the
balance
and
consistency
of
this
one
should
not
be
overlooked
well
done
overall
definitely
a
solid
beer
good
for
beginners
in
the
hoppy
ale
world
unfortunately
and
this
is
my
opinion
it
does
not
stand
out
among
lots
of
other
similar
pale
ales
bordering
forgettable
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
stones
best
selling
brand
look
foward
to
getting
a
6
pack
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
for
a
pale
ale
it
was
far
too
malty
and
the
hops
were
metallic
tasting
in
an
unpleasant
way
check
it

an

tinged

with
an
off
white
head
tons
of
caramel
on
the
nose
backed
up
with
spicy

a
hint
of

tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
tons
of
caramel
malty
goodness
with
overtones
of
earthy
hops
and
a
citrus

bitterness
softly
bringing
it
all
together
pretty
thick
mouthfeel
for
an
apa
in
part
because
of
the
sweetness
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
easy
drinking
and
probably
my
favorite
stone
offering
so
far
this
is
one
of
the
original
stone
beers
and
its
still
impressive
overall
this
is
a
great
apa
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
a
very
rich
yet
complex
taste
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
o
i
like
it
overall
solid
apa
must
try
it
will
be
more
amenable
to
those
who
like
a
stronger
malt
bill
but
it
is
not
without
its
hop
charm
o
very
solid
but
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
apa
o
nice
pale
ale
without
being
in
your
face
hoppy
overall
a
decent
hoppy
pale
ale
i
would
never
pick
it
over
an
ipa
though
overall
4
0
as
far
as
grades
go
this
is
an
excellent
i
e
4
0
pale
ale
it
is
not
i
assume
an
indian
pale
ale
this
means
the
level
of
hops
is
not
equal
to
that
which
british
brewers
introduced
to
keep
beer
fresh
on
the
way
to
the
indian
colonies
interestingly
i
take
this
as
a
less
hopped
ipa
which
is
obviously
just
a
pa
regardless
this
brew
is
a
workhorse
it
is
fabulous
with
food
but
is
a
sessionable
beer
that
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
another
highly
recommended
and
relatively
cheap
9
for
a
six
overall
a
solid
apa
from
stone
less
inyourface
than
many
of
their
beers
which
i
appreciate
isnt
this
the
standard
by
which
all
other
american
pale
ales
should
be
measured
theyve
been
making
this
recipe
since
july
1996
according
to
wording
on
the
bottle
which
is
to
say
for
eons
considering
the
fast
changing
american
craft
beer
market
nice
caramel
malt
flavors
are
the
sweet
to
the
bitter
of
this
hop
heavy
ale
o
another
excellent
stone
brew
as
double
bastard
is
arrogant
bastards
big
brother
id
be
inclined
to
consider
this
its
little
brother
has
a
lot
of
the
same
flavors
just
on
a
lower
level
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
appreciates
an
ale
with
lots
going
on
overall
i
would
say
this
may
be
a
benchmark
for
the
pale
ale
category
alongside
sierra
nevadas
classic
green
label
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
stone
think
of
this
as
their
light
ipa
all
the
flavor
and
awesomeness
but
in
a
more
sessionable
variety
as
usual
stone
uses
quality
ingredients
in
terms
of
both
malt
and
hops
to
make
one
of
their
most
balanced
beers
while
stone
ipa
is
distributed
across
the
country
stone
pale
ale
continues
to
have
more
of
a
niche
following
which
is
fine
by
me
nice
pale
ale
solid
flavor
and
good
balance
this
one
is
a
clear
and
copper
colored
brew
the
head
is
white
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
smell
is
clean
and
balanced
with
both
malt
and
hop
qualities
herbal
and
earthy
in
aroma
some
underlying
stone
fruit
m
the
taste
is
more
assertive
bitter
ans
strong
on
the
dry
side
but
lots
of
malt
flavor
hop
resin
and
flavor
is
prominent
throughout
full
body
and
satisfying
overall
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
brew
always
makes
me
happy
as
i
dont
have
it
as
often
as
other
pale
ales
clear
burning
orange
in
body
with
offwhite
fluffy
head
that
lasts
aroma
of
citrus
dry
grass
bready
caramel
notes
tastes
of
biscuits
dry
grass
evolves
into
citrus
notes
mild
bitterness
finishes
it
up
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
thick
and
chewy
a
stone
offering
that
has
history
mild
flavor
profile
for
modern
times
but
still
a
good
easy
drinkin
brew
drinkability
i
will
definitely
buy
a
fresher
bottle
in
the
future
but
this
old
one
was
still
pretty
good
high
c
overall
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
on
its
a
straight
up
pale
ale
cant
lose
with
this
one
stone
pale
ale
3
55
this
offering
pours
up
a
deep
goldmedium
amber
with
a
small
half
finger
head
no
real
retention
and
bits
of
lacing
the
nose
is
kind
of
pine
bread
and
citrus
taste
is
a
very
sweet
almost
apple
juice
flavor
on
the
initial
sip
giving
way
to
a
grapefruitiness
and
finally
a
spicy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
this
is
a
good
one
maybe
not
the
best
ever
but
solid
a
nicely
hopped
apa
a
bit
restrained
for
stone
but
its
appreciated
here
drinkable
and
still
carries
that
distinct
stone
finish
i
need
to
remember
to
drink
this
as
a
go
to
apa
a
great
american
pale
ale
this
is
by
all
means
a
go
to
while
not
as
outrageous
as
some
of
stones
other
beers
this
shows
that
they
can
indeed
make
a
very
good
standard
ale
o
just
average
may
be
due
to
the
date
of
the
bottle
but
the
major
notes
on
this
one
are
malts
and
more
malts
its
not
bad
but
not
sure
id
seek
out
a
freshie
o
an
average
pale
ale
nothing
really
stood
out
with
it
but
nothing
really
offended
the
senses
o
this
is
a
simple
malty
pale
ale
big
simplicity
makes
this
one
a
goto
when
you
want
something
simple
and
clean
with
refinement
o
one
of
the
best
examples
of
californian
apa
there
is
a
good
session
or
pairing
beer
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
caramel
side
with
a
darker
color
than
other
apas
i
think
its
wonderful
and
has
unique
character
o
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
which
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
first
california
microbrews
which
will
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
refrigerator
a
brew
that
pairs
well
with
almost
any
food
and
is
also
a
great
session
beer
appearance
is
leaning
more
amber
than
expected
finger
thick
head
on
a
10
oz
pour
eggshell
colored
good
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
closer
to
an
arrogant
bastard
bitter
taste
is
milder
than
expected
given
the
profile
to
this
point
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
bolder
than
many
and
still
solid
o
not
the
most
exciting
beer
or
even
the
most
exciting
pale
ale
easily
drinkable
and
moderately
tasty
but
nothing
too
special
i
bought
this
beer
because
i
realized
i
hadnt
had
it
in
a
while
i
didnt
realize
that
i
had
failed
to
ever
review
it
on
ba
its
actually
pretty
odd
pale
ale
for
stone
in
the
sense
that
it
is
balanced
and
not
particularly
hoppy
it
is
absurdly
drinkable
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
good
brew
i
would
have
this
one
again
solid
pale
ale
something
easy
to
drink
when
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
beer
might
even
be
safe
to
call
this
a
session
beer
at
only
5
4
abv
i
know
ive
done
it
before
o
leaning
toward
the
side
of
an
ipa
this
pale
ale
is
one
of
the
more
common
stones
that
you
can
find
regardless
it
is
a
good
start
point
for
getting
into
the
stone
variety
and
a
very
good
pale
ale
o
overall
i
got
this
beer
on
clearance
for
5
a
six
pack
id
say
its
one
of
the
best
5
ive
ever
spent
its
a
delicious
offering
from
stone
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
drinkability
i
like
this
best
because
of
the
cedar
notes
overall
a
very
serious
take
on
a
pale
ale
normally
i
think
of
them
as
a
light
crisp
ipa
but
this
ones
doesnt
hold
back
sweet
clean
malts
citrusy
piney
a
little
caramel
fruity
slight
drybitter
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
soft
carbonation
if
you
havent
had
stones
pale
ale
you
are
really
missing
something
special
this
beer
is
not
your
typical
pale
ale
it
is
more
malty
than
most
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
great
brown
color
lasting
head
and
a
nice
malty
yet
very
well
balanced
flavor
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
rest
if
you
dont
like
bitterhoppy
beer
and
stay
away
from
pale
ales
do
not
ignore
this
beer
it
is
not
hoppy
by
any
means
and
yet
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
overly
sweet
or
malty
either
stones
pale
ale
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
you
will
enjoy
over
and
over
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
american
pale
ale
it
had
a
medium
hop
fruit
flavor
that
was
not
over
powering
light
amber
in
color
with
a
clean
crisp
pour
a
nice
mild
pale
ale
from
stone
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
have
not
tasted
a
beer
i
didnt
like
come
out
of
this
north
county
san
diego
brewery
all
around
great
brew
overall
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
as
hoppy
as
other
pales
and
really
its
pricy
between
1114
99
ive
seen
this
for
a
6pack
its
worth
a
drink
but
there
are
better
pales
out
there
and
cheaper
also
o
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
that
i
can
drink
again
but
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
better
i
think
overall
i
wanna
like
this
beer
but
i
cant
the
soapy
character
present
is
just
too
much
to
overlook
outside
the
soapiness
there
are
real
positive
qualities
but
not
enough
to
save
it
from
mediocrity
its
drinkable
but
not
something
id
prefer
to
drink
candidate
for
a
rereview
maybe
i
just
wasnt
in
the
right
mood
for
a
pale
its
average
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
stone
chalky
and
dry
but
otherwise
very
easy
to
drink
with
adequate
malt
and
bitterness
the
price
tag
will
keep
me
from
buying
more
not
my
favorite
pale
by
a
mile
but
i
give
it
points
for
being
different
than
expected
taste
is
a
lot
of
bubblegum
for
some
reason
initial
citric
sweetness
dry
herbal
hoppiness
and
coarse
dry
mouthfeel
soapy
and
bubblegum
flavors
linger
not
digging
this
one
bit
offflavors
seem
to
settle
out
with
a
couple
more
sips
but
the
flavors
dont
meld
together
any
better
whats
up
with
this
one
tough
to
finish
overall
very
drinkable
but
there
are
others
out
there
which
i
prefer
much
more
stone
blesses
their
own
name
vowing
that
there
are
no
foreign
adulterants
within
the
liquid
drink
if
you
ask
me
id
rather
drink
water
final
thoughts
ive
only
had
a
few
of
the
offerings
from
stone
and
while
i
cant
say
that
this
is
their
best
it
is
definitely
a
good
take
on
the
style
and
memorable
doa
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
darker
than
most
pale
ales
with
a
big
billowy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
scents
are
a
very
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
bread
the
taste
is
more
maltforward
than
the
the
scent
implies
and
more
so
than
many
other
pale
ales
bready
and
earthy
with
a
slight
floral
hops
bitterness
to
provide
balance
good
mouthfeel
for
the
style
not
the
best
product
offered
by
stone
nor
the
best
pale
ale
available
but
still
enjoyable
at
the
grill
at
the
torrey
pines
lodge
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
but
not
particularly
outstanding
a
good
representative
of
the
style
with
stones
individuality
coming
through
in
a
much
less
subtle
way
than
normal
the
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
heavy
cap
of
white
foam
the
aroma
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
and
invites
you
in
the
beer
lays
down
easy
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
a
heavy
hand
of
bitter
citrus
hops
highly
drinkable
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
o
another
good
brew
by
stone
easily
drinkable
and
went
down
smooth
overall
its
an
uppermedium
priced
beer
thats
well
worth
it
if
youre
an
apa
fan
prefer
this
over
a
lot
of
the
more
intense
stone
varieties
if
im
honest
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
beer
arrives
a
crystal
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
1
5
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
mild
but
approachable
with
earthy
hop
character
along
with
a
gentle
pale
2row
malt
base
according
to
the
tour
guide
only
2
malts
used
2row
and
crystal
60
not
sure
he
wouldnt
confirm
the
flavor
is
nice
and
easy
drinking
the
hops
again
are
a
little
earhty
in
character
with
the
malt
base
providing
a
pleasant
flavor
mildly
bitter
very
approachable
lighter
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pale
amazing
that
when
it
was
introduced
it
was
a
hop
bomb
of
sorts
and
now
that
seems
to
be
the
norm
a
trendsetter
m
i
think
this
was
well
blended
the
beer
was
a
little
oily
feeling
pretty
clean
finish
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
but
it
could
some
more
hops
pours
copper
with
one
finger
white
head
aroma
is
nicely
floral
with
a
nice
citrus
and
strong
malt
backbone
bittersweet
finish
with
the
hops
follows
an
up
front
sweetness
toffee
biscuits
fruits
hint
of
citrus
and
mango
easy
drinking
medium
carbonation
slightly
resiny
good
example
of
the
style
nice
beer
good
balance
good
craft
pours
an
dark
orange
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
and
above
avearge
lacing
smell
is
heavy
grapefruit
citrus
and
biscuit
taste
is
not
very
complex
but
pleasent
with
malt
sweetness
and
fruitiness
backed
by
a
grapefruit
bitternss
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
drinkability
this
meets
my
expectations
of
a
pale
ale
rather
well
while
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
it
is
still
a
balanced
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
beers
from
stone
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
them
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
forms
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
spotty
lacing
throughout
floral
hop
aroma
with
some
pale
bready
malts
in
the
background
taste
is
similar
with
full
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
nice
hopped
finish
seems
pretty
balanced
medium
bodied
at
first
a
very
nice
looking
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
was
not
one
id
come
to
expect
from
a
pale
ale
somewhat
off
smelling
to
me
but
clean
and
fresh
when
the
beer
actually
hit
my
tongue
for
the
first
time
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
the
result
its
not
the
actual
taste
that
put
me
off
but
rather
the
strange
lingering
bitterness
that
felt
bland
and
unpleasant
it
just
worked
to
mask
all
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
which
if
i
could
taste
im
sure
it
would
be
great
i
love
stone
brewery
and
will
always
continue
to
buy
from
them
but
this
is
one
you
will
not
find
me
buying
again
any
time
soon
othis
is
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
exceptional
nothing
stands
out
except
the
awesome
smell
but
one
i
could
never
turn
down
and
could
enjoy
anytime
of
the
year
o
very
nice
an
easy
drinker
with
full
flavor
and
a
tasteful
hop
level
id
even
pull
the
hops
back
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
if
possible
and
then
call
it
super
o
a
very
nice
straightforward
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
copper
ale
with
a
sheet
of
white
foam
and
excellent
clarity
leaving
some
decent
lace
a
somewhat
spicy
smell
with
an
unusually
english
malt
profile
from
this
brewery
there
some
aromas
of
prune
and
citrus
flavor
is
malty
with
again
spicy
hops
and
a
good
english
almost
high
end
esb
malt
character
really
nice
flavor
just
not
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
an
offdry
finish
nice
pale
ale
really
dig
the
take
not
all
flashy
like
some
of
todays
offerings
o
wow
this
was
the
first
time
ive
had
stones
pale
ale
and
i
was
expecting
a
beer
that
barely
qualifies
as
a
pale
but
they
were
surprisingly
even
in
creating
this
beer
theres
no
harshness
to
it
at
all
itd
be
perfect
with
practically
any
meal
the
finish
is
clean
and
delicious
this
beer
is
a
beauty
o
very
easily
drinkable
wasnt
expecting
the
perfumy
and
floral
hop
presence
though
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
there
wasnt
more
hop
flavor
to
this
the
malt
just
seemed
to
overwhelm
the
hops
that
were
there
a
solid
apa
though
poured
into
a
glass
tumbler
pours
a
medium
redorange
amber
a
half
finger
fine
slightly
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
light
film
aroma
of
herbal
hops
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
of
bready
and
caramel
malts
and
hops
finishes
with
malt
and
herbal
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
not
as
hop
forward
as
other
stone
brews
but
appropriate
for
the
style
a
nice
pale
ale
o
a
very
solid
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
pale
ale
not
much
else
to
say
o
about
as
good
as
a
pale
ale
can
get
in
my
opinion
well
balanced
hoppy
smooth
o
ill
admit
i
am
not
a
hop
fan
this
is
one
of
stones
year
around
beers
this
beer
is
good
it
pours
a
darker
than
most
pale
ales
amber
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
leaves
near
perfect
lacing
the
smell
has
a
very
sweet
butterscotch
and
fruity
smell
it
reminds
me
of
fermenting
apples
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
at
fist
and
flows
into
a
small
bite
of
hops
with
some
faint
bitterness
that
lasts
briefly
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
more
creamy
than
crisp
but
thats
not
to
say
it
is
lacking
any
carbonation
i
will
definatly
be
picking
this
one
up
in
my
next
mixed
six
pack
i
grab
cheers
when
reviewing
this
one
has
to
dismiss
any
other
stone
beers
they
have
had
before
especially
of
they
are
lovers
of
the
hop
as
i
am
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
trusty
affligem
chalice
i
love
the
appearance
a
bit
darker
than
a
pale
ale
but
a
beautiful
two
finger
head
and
a
deep
orange
nose
is
nice
malts
and
slight
grassy
piney
no
definitely
not
a
ruination
but
i
can
enjoy
a
beer
afterwards
without
having
to
bump
up
the
ibu
nice
mix
of
british
pa
and
california
pa
malty
with
a
eccentric
piney
aftertaste
light
to
medium
bodied
with
the
enduring
oily
hops
overall
an
excellent
pale
ale
definitely
great
for
a
sunny
afternoon
session
without
killing
you
for
the
evening
cheers
copper
pour
with
a
nice
head
sweet
smell
of
fruit
and
pine
nice
hoppy
piney
bitterness
that
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
malt
flavor
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
but
i
wasnt
as
blown
away
with
it
as
i
thought
i
would
be
i
made
the
mistake
of
trying
their
ipa
before
having
their
pale
ale
will
definitely
try
again
love
the
burnt
red
orange
appearance
and
hoppy
caramel
nose
it
gives
off
this
beer
is
refinely
refreshing
while
at
the
same
time
tasting
like
caramel
hops
together
all
the
way
through
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
which
makes
each
sip
easy
to
drink
despite
the
bitter
character
gotta
be
inthe
mood
for
some
hops
when
you
drink
this
because
after
each
drink
i
can
taste
the
bitterness
not
a
bad
thing
ive
been
impressed
with
the
stone
brewing
company
thus
far
and
look
forward
to
having
more
of
their
stable
of
beers
a
cool
pale
ale
i
view
this
one
as
sort
of
a
hybrid
between
the
english
and
the
american
pales
pours
rather
red
for
a
pale
ale
big
fluffy
head
too
smells
like
english
malts
and
caramel
but
also
a
very
robust
oily
hop
vibe
flavor
is
hops
prominently
in
the
american
vein
but
dusty
english
malts
in
the
body
love
this
mix
almost
an
ipa
but
more
going
on
here
highly
rated
for
a
reason
mouthfeel
is
good
a
little
heavy
than
most
pale
ales
a
sixpack
might
be
a
stretch
but
i
like
a
good
challenge
pricey
but
a
nice
example
of
what
a
pale
ale
can
still
offer
thanks
for
this
one
stone
the
best
part
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
was
the
smell
the
hard
work
that
the
people
at
stone
brewing
company
put
into
this
beers
creation
is
most
evident
in
the
complexity
of
the
smell
of
this
ale
from
when
it
is
freshly
poured
till
the
final
sip
sampled
from
a
standard
pint
glass
not
bad
but
imperfect
the
malt
and
hops
are
quite
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
fruity
aroma
however
the
hop
flavour
seems
attenuated
possibly
by
age
also
the
harsh
background
bitterness
detracts
from
the
overall
character
a
decent
american
pale
ale
but
not
outstanding
o
wow
great
nose
and
perfectly
balanced
add
its
drinkability
excellent
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
nice
head
smells
hoppy
with
earthiness
and
florals
the
hops
assert
their
presence
in
the
flavor
with
a
distinct
mild
level
of
bitterness
piney
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
there
balanced
but
this
has
always
felt
to
me
as
a
nonhophead
to
be
a
hop
forward
pale
ale
but
i
like
it
its
assertive
but
not
too
strong
this
was
one
of
my
first
american
pale
ales
and
remains
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
this
isnt
a
beer
i
go
to
all
that
often
but
usually
once
a
year
i
do
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
a
6er
of
this
and
always
enjoy
it
overall
very
nice
pale
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
stone
brewing
definitely
worth
buying
again
overall
smooth
and
flavorful
a
great
example
of
an
apa
easy
to
drink
with
a
lot
of
subtle
flavor
that
i
look
for
in
lower
gravity
beers
hops
are
apologetically
west
coast
in
character
without
being
overpowering
might
not
be
my
favorite
offering
of
stone
and
definitely
not
what
i
would
personally
consider
to
be
a
representative
example
of
the
west
coast
apa
style
although
that
doesnt
matter
as
theyve
pulled
off
the
beer
they
intended
to
make
here
it
is
a
good
quality
product
that
is
sure
to
be
a
crowd
pleaser
to
those
that
couldnt
stand
arrogant
bastard
as
well
as
other
intense
products
by
stone
not
sure
why
they
consider
this
to
be
one
of
their
flagship
beers
when
theyre
so
renowned
for
their
hops
and
crazy
recipes
but
it
still
stands
as
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
a
try
othe
classic
good
beer
not
great
in
my
opinion
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
taste
gotta
say
i
was
expecting
more
hops
in
stones
pale
ale
sierra
nevada
has
more
hop
character
in
their
pa
than
stone
which
kinda
made
sense
when
i
compare
sns
torpedo
to
stones
ipa
i
think
they
like
to
make
the
hop
presence
a
little
more
subtle
than
most
in
escondido
the
hops
really
come
out
in
the
mouthfeel
and
bitter
aftertaste
the
prominent
malt
presence
makes
this
a
well
balanced
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
a
solid
beer
ill
pick
this
up
when
im
looking
for
a
bit
more
malt
in
my
pale
ale
o
love
stone
and
their
brews
another
a
in
my
book
not
too
much
going
in
the
beer
but
plenty
to
be
a
great
brew
pours
a
copper
color
w
a
one
finger
off
white
head
massive
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
somewhat
hazy
in
appearance
the
nose
is
caramel
hops
malt
and
some
floral
notes
a
little
on
the
weak
side
but
improves
with
warming
the
taste
is
fairly
pleasant
with
the
hops
really
coming
out
to
balance
the
malt
not
bitter
at
all
w
a
smooth
aftertaste
i
can
see
putting
several
of
these
down
after
mowing
the
grass
or
any
other
summer
activity
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
cheers
rjt
o
i
think
this
bottle
may
be
past
its
drink
by
date
cannot
read
on
bottle
would
like
to
try
this
beer
fresh
and
compare
this
is
an
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
mild
and
simple
but
its
clean
balanced
and
delicious
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
but
can
come
off
as
an
ipa
at
least
for
me
anyway
i
think
the
bitterness
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
little
bit
this
drinks
kinda
like
an
english
pale
nice
to
see
an
american
pale
ale
thats
not
a
hop
bomb
now
and
then
easy
drinking
but
a
little
bland
to
me
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
auburn
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
piney
hops
taste
is
a
hop
bomb
significant
bitterness
throughout
no
balance
to
speak
of
feels
medium
bodied
and
very
bitter
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
taste
is
great
malt
with
subtle
hops
and
a
mild
bitterness
medium
body
with
minimum
carbonation
o
a
good
pale
ale
with
ecent
flavor
and
balance
good
with
many
foods
oi
like
this
one
a
lot
stone
sure
knows
how
to
make
a
good
brewski
totally
seeing
myself
indulging
myself
with
more
stone
in
the
future
had
this
recently
and
was
a
bit
surprised
not
that
it
was
bad
just
that
i
wasnt
surprised
by
it
on
the
upside
it
had
a
darker
pale
ale
appearance
with
decent
head
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
wasnt
that
much
nose
to
it
certainly
not
a
overally
hoppy
pale
ale
it
tasted
good
fine
in
the
mouthfeel
area
and
overall
good
stone
pale
ale
is
quite
good
lots
going
on
with
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
nice
offwhite
head
that
is
lacing
like
a
vicky
secret
model
the
smell
includes
fresh
hops
and
pine
the
taste
is
a
brilliant
combo
of
hops
and
malt
the
hops
keep
the
beer
crisp
the
malt
enought
to
balance
the
hops
and
kept
the
beer
creamy
the
mouthfell
is
good
not
over
powering
with
the
nice
5
4
abv
session
definite
possibility
overall
a
very
good
beer
try
it
excellent
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
o
a
really
nice
pale
ale
that
has
a
nice
balance
of
hop
flavors
and
malt
i
have
this
on
tap
a
few
times
and
this
was
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
on
tap
but
still
a
really
solid
pale
ale
o
a
quite
good
pale
ale
verges
on
being
a
hoppy
amber
ale
worth
a
shot
all
in
all
it
is
good
beer
and
i
expect
stone
not
to
be
shy
about
the
hops
as
it
is
their
trade
mark
but
honestly
this
is
so
close
to
an
ipa
just
slightly
smoother
and
sweeter
i
would
actually
call
it
an
ipa
light
rather
than
an
apa
or
maybe
it
is
a
hoppy
amber
a
really
nice
well
balanced
pale
ale
with
great
hop
character
a
solid
beer
from
stone
stones
pale
ale
sticks
to
the
style
with
accuracy
though
is
a
bit
unchallenging
the
potency
of
their
arrogant
bastard
does
not
seem
to
imply
that
they
mean
to
follow
this
with
every
release
still
a
morethanadequate
apa
though
i
will
probably
stick
to
others
in
the
future
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
from
stone
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
d
a
nice
apa
clean
and
is
quite
bitter
that
being
said
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
more
malt
character
mslight
cream
very
hearty
yet
goes
done
really
smooth
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
pale
malt
front
light
and
fruity
with
some
citrus
and
grapefruit
notes
from
the
hops
finishes
bitter
but
nothing
too
intense
o
a
little
too
bitter
on
the
finish
for
my
taste
but
still
pretty
good
i
liked
the
hazed
infused
slightly
better
overrall
not
a
bad
choice
by
any
means
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
apas
and
certainly
not
worth
raving
about
that
said
its
still
probably
better
than
the
majority
of
apas
on
the
shelf
o
pretty
unremarkable
but
easy
to
get
down
and
can
make
a
session
of
it
if
you
want
nothing
id
ever
seak
out
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
not
as
good
as
i
thought
from
before
rating
a
lot
of
good
beers
since
will
do
that
o
too
bitter
for
me
per
the
style
but
perhaps
this
is
due
to
me
being
three
weeks
past
the
best
by
date
id
be
willing
to
give
this
one
another
go
with
a
fresher
bottle
picked
up
in
a
mix
n
match
sixer
obviously
it
was
available
due
to
age
o
not
an
overly
aggressive
pale
but
a
good
solid
pale
ale
o
minimalistic
pale
ale
from
a
complex
brewery
most
simple
and
toned
down
of
their
brews
ive
had
yet
should
be
a
great
introduction
for
a
transition
into
craft
brewery
bright
red
copper
quite
clear
with
a
huge
frothy
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
or
yeasty
character
in
there
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
the
main
players
being
the
hops
maybe
more
floral
flavors
than
what
is
found
in
other
west
coast
pale
ales
and
ipas
but
regardless
the
focus
of
the
beer
is
clear
the
malt
is
in
there
as
well
but
only
for
support
of
the
hops
and
seems
to
be
mainly
comprised
of
just
typical
caramel
malts
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
more
well
rounded
this
beer
has
a
moderate
body
and
carbonation
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
puckering
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
to
me
the
apa
style
should
yield
beers
that
are
good
for
a
session
and
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
fit
that
bill
it
appears
that
other
reviewers
are
finding
more
malt
than
i
do
could
have
something
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
beers
i
have
they
are
getting
close
to
the
best
by
date
overall
a
nice
specimen
a
very
drinkable
beer
like
most
things
stone
makes
this
was
one
of
the
last
widelyavailable
brews
from
stone
that
i
tried
nothing
mindblowing
but
a
solid
pale
ale
nonetheless
o
very
flavorful
very
good
pale
ale
as
per
usual
with
stone
good
but
not
something
i
could
have
often
do
besides
the
look
i
found
it
mostly
dull
and
uninteresting
as
a
whole
easy
drinking
though
yes
made
me
burp
a
lot
and
i
like
that
like
all
stone
beers
this
is
very
good
but
this
one
is
sort
of
heavy
and
lacking
the
sophistication
i
would
expect
from
the
style
drink
one
of
the
1st
pales
and
1st
craft
beers
i
had
before
venturing
out
great
balance
and
hop
note
right
where
it
should
be
as
a
small
pale
with
some
nice
flavors
overall
nicely
done
draught
cambridge
house
this
one
poured
a
slightly
orangishamber
color
there
was
a
decent
offwhite
head
on
it
that
left
some
lacing
decent
but
slightly
lighter
aroma
mainly
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
good
also
nice
malt
body
with
no
sweetness
a
bit
of
piney
hops
with
maybe
a
bit
of
grapefruit
not
overly
bitter
just
a
real
nice
apa
o
very
please
with
stones
apa
was
most
surprised
by
the
character
of
the
hops
medium
amber
with
a
thick
clingy
head
smell
is
subdued
malt
and
mild
hop
aroma
taste
is
much
more
aggressive
nice
and
malty
on
the
front
with
a
quick
punch
of
fruity
hops
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
back
end
lots
of
bright
hops
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
sticky
with
medium
carbonation
delicious
stone
is
just
brilliant
at
making
these
great
hoppy
ales
and
ipas
i
could
down
several
of
these
o
great
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
one
of
my
current
all
time
favorites
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
close
to
perfect
for
the
style
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
nice
break
from
the
american
style
probably
wont
be
a
new
goto
beer
but
id
be
happy
to
have
it
again
o
stone
brewing
co
knows
what
they
are
and
how
to
appeal
to
peoples
taste
good
beer
to
keep
around
here
m
seems
to
improve
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
but
overall
pretty
smooth
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
copper
color
slight
haze
nice
off
white
thick
head
which
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
slight
hop
smell
seems
odd
to
me
to
have
a
stone
without
the
in
your
face
hops
medium
light
feel
the
taste
is
pretty
good
tasty
caramel
malty
goodness
some
hop
bite
on
the
way
down
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
i
could
see
me
putting
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
session
o
a
solid
drinker
and
a
hoppy
pale
ale
fairly
sessionable
for
hop
heads
ill
have
it
again
the
most
relaxed
easy
drinking
stone
brew
out
there
good
beer
when
you
would
like
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
id
call
this
a
gateway
beer
a
must
drink
i
will
try
not
to
use
relatively
three
times
in
the
next
review
bottle
poured
into
a
surly
nonic
glass
a
nice
caramel
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
off
whtie
head
the
aroma
is
rather
light
but
i
get
ntoes
of
toast
and
tropical
fruit
maybe
pineapple
or
mango
also
caramel
medium
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
and
light
brown
sugar
upfront
with
a
nice
hop
bitter
kick
in
the
middle
head
leaves
some
lace
as
it
settles
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
no
notice
of
the
abv
some
bitterness
lingers
draught
at
our
hotel
in
san
diego
pours
clear
copper
color
with
tan
head
moderate
carbonation
aroma
is
heavy
malts
citrus
and
resin
taste
is
semisweet
with
some
moderate
bittering
hops
thin
and
a
bit
watery
its
has
an
oily
texture
ok
beer
o
an
awesome
pale
ale
great
drinkability
and
balance
might
be
my
new
go
to
beer
wish
it
was
a
bit
cheaper
though
i
put
this
exceptional
beer
right
there
with
victory
prima
pils
i
just
love
the
quality
comming
from
america
these
days
this
beer
has
a
burnt
dark
chocolate
hop
flavor
that
will
make
your
tongue
twist
and
curl
around
every
drop
it
is
intuitively
obvious
to
the
beer
loving
taste
bud
that
this
is
one
fine
quality
beer
the
fermentation
and
aroma
are
superior
to
other
beers
the
after
taste
runs
away
too
quickly
making
one
chase
after
that
perfect
flavor
yum
publix
mix
a
6
pack
purchase
is
how
i
stumbled
upon
this
beauty
4
were
throw
aways
one
was
good
and
this
one
was
life
changing
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
strong
looking
head
on
it
the
lacing
is
pretty
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
and
a
light
malt
aroma
in
there
too
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
for
a
stone
brew
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
bad
but
still
overall
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
stone
brew
stone
is
all
you
have
to
say
on
this
one
ive
never
had
a
stone
beer
that
i
didnt
like
or
wouldnt
be
happy
to
drink
anytime
anywhere
it
was
ok
good
promise
with
initial
bitterness
and
balance
of
malts
but
it
wares
off
and
falls
a
little
flat
it
fits
the
style
of
a
pale
but
i
think
some
of
stones
other
offerings
are
far
superior
a
very
good
beer
if
it
were
available
fresh
in
australia
at
american
prices
this
would
be
a
regular
purchase
for
me
not
a
session
beer
its
too
flavoursome
for
that
but
i
would
happily
drink
a
couple
in
a
sitting
doverall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
apa
had
enough
going
on
that
made
me
want
more
i
loved
the
hop
profile
and
how
well
everything
was
balanced
a
nice
apa
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
quite
refreshing
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
it
is
a
decent
lawnmowing
beer
but
most
other
stone
beers
are
much
better
only
pick
this
up
if
it
is
on
sale
o
really
good
beer
unusually
constructed
for
a
west
coast
apa
on
the
take
home
scale
i
would
take
home
a
six
pack
reviewed
on
5122011
taste
is
skillfully
balanced
with
some
bitter
qualities
maybe
some
sour
grapefruit
alongside
darker
malts
that
add
a
sweet
quality
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
drunkability
definitely
a
malt
forward
pale
ale
i
like
it
could
go
with
food
or
by
itself
o
this
has
really
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
6pack
of
these
in
a
night
it
has
great
flavor
and
goes
down
very
easy
this
is
a
great
apa
and
i
recommend
trying
it
i
will
continue
to
purchase
these
cheers
not
my
personal
favorite
take
on
the
style
but
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
none
the
less
very
appealing
to
both
malt
and
hop
lovers
has
almost
a
hoppy
brown
ale
characteristic
closer
to
a
little
arrogant
bastard
rather
than
the
ipa
in
my
opinion
very
sessionable
i
just
dont
get
the
price
point
here
i
mean
i
am
a
local
to
stonebrew
yet
i
can
get
a
6er
of
lagunitas
ipa
or
nb
ranger
ipa
for
cheaper
than
their
pale
explain
that
logic
d
definitely
would
go
back
to
this
pale
ale
as
it
has
all
the
qualities
i
like
in
the
style
great
color
great
lacing
and
hops
to
write
home
about
not
as
good
as
it
is
on
draft
wouldnt
really
spend
10
bucks
on
a
sixer
taste
is
excellent
example
of
a
classic
west
coast
style
apa
with
excellent
body
character
depth
balance
and
complexity
it
has
spicypeppery
grapefruitpine
bitterness
with
caramel
and
toasty
sweetness
juicy
yeastiness
not
bad
but
something
in
the
flavor
is
contributing
a
vegetal
note
which
just
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
might
be
the
hops
might
be
a
yeast
byproduct
dms
maybe
but
i
dont
really
like
it
not
my
favorite
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
finish
bitter
hops
with
heavy
malt
o
if
i
were
looking
for
an
ipa
i
would
have
been
wowed
as
a
pale
ale
not
so
much
a
great
brew
in
the
wrong
classification
overall
awesome
beer
loved
it
was
a
well
balanced
tasting
beer
that
went
down
vey
easy
o
i
knew
stone
could
do
it
actually
no
i
didnt
i
honestly
thought
this
was
going
to
be
another
cascade
tongue
bruiser
but
in
this
case
it
was
good
to
be
wrong
a
very
solid
session
beer
in
the
mold
of
brooklyn
lager
and
sierra
nevada
pale
id
drink
this
again
and
again
at
the
zoo
and
elsewhere
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
but
nothing
mind
blowing
it
is
rather
pricey
at
11
a
sixer
acceptable
out
of
the
bottle
as
it
is
on
the
tap
sort
of
the
smaller
younger
brother
though
o
easy
drinking
pale
ale
almost
too
easy
as
i
got
it
to
have
with
my
food
but
the
beer
is
half
gone
but
no
food
d
something
of
an
anomaly
from
stonea
maltcentric
beer
in
the
english
style
im
not
in
love
with
it
but
it
was
ok
for
what
it
was
o
great
pale
ale
that
is
american
but
still
brings
honor
to
the
good
maltcentric
english
styles
this
is
an
autumn
ale
leafy
and
woody
its
not
hard
to
drink
this
ale
make
sure
you
are
a
malt
head
as
this
beer
was
much
more
of
a
barley
based
drink
than
i
expected
the
hops
could
be
brought
up
a
notch
its
a
good
session
beer
but
not
as
finely
balanced
as
the
california
classic
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
overall
i
like
it
would
still
rather
have
an
ipa
over
an
apa
any
day
but
i
would
never
complain
about
it
lovely
brew
here
go
grab
one
for
yourself
and
check
it
out
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
had
complex
yet
very
drinkable
slightly
bitter
but
the
sweet
core
keeps
it
well
balanced
this
beer
actually
improves
my
opinion
of
stone
more
than
all
the
extreme
beers
making
a
mouthwrenching
ipa
or
strong
ale
is
easier
than
the
subtle
balance
needed
for
this
apa
it
was
relatively
thin
and
silky
and
it
left
a
pleasant
oily
texture
in
my
mouth

a
malt
background
and
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
and
beer
is
very
smooth
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
i
cannot
consider
it
among
their
top
offerings

this

a

that
i
think
would
be
better
suited
to
go
with
some

of

than
by

5the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
goes
down
well
this
was
not
the
best
stone
beer
i
have
ever
had
by
any
means
and
it
may
be
one
of
the
lesser
beers
that
stone
makes
but
overall
not
bad

similar
to

with

roastiness
with

on

i
will

wow
just
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
its
a
shame
i
havent
found
any
stone
in
columbia
but
when
i
get
back
im
scouring
the
town
a
great
apa
enjoyed
at
my
place
restaurant
in
newtown
ct
this
one
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
very
healthy
offwhite
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
mild
pine
hop
with
a
vague
banana
nut
malt
very
mild
but
nice
the
flavor
is
also
mild
but
it
brings
a
light
citrus
bite
and
crispy
bread
with
some
quiet
caramel
underpinnings
this
not
a
sweet
treat
of
an
apa
its
pretty
acidic
sort
of
spicey
a
bit
dry
i
do
pick
up
some
more
general
fruitiness
and
banana
as
i
get
near
the
end
its
on
the
aqueous
side
fairly
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
if
the
taste
suits
you
it
was
a
little
dissapointing
to
me
considering
its
from
stone
not
memorable
or
compelling
but
certainly
an
ok
option
and
worth
a
try
d
well
balanced
pale
ale
nice
and
smooth
d
when
i
think
of
my
ideal
pale
aleipa
flavors
it
always
somehow
goes
back
to
stone
ipa
and
barrelhouse
cumberland
pale
ale
the
dry
crisp
hoppy
sierra
nevadaesque
ones
have
their
place
and
time
but
these
british
influenced
toffee
sweet
versions
really
do
it
for
me
stone
pale
ale
fits
that
bill
and
hopefully
will
be
making
a
regular
appearance
from
now
on
stone
pale
ale
is
a
slightly
hazy
lively
reddish
light
amber
ale
with
a
fluffy
waxy
lumpy
yellowish
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
grassy
aroma
with
some
light
malt
here
are
notes
of
bread
and
pineapple
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
lively
on
the
tongue
he
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
its
well
balanced
not
very
bitter
but
quite
hoppy
its
bright
and
fruity
with
notes
of
tropical
fruit
pineapple
and
tangerine
its
a
refreshing
session
ale
poured
to
a
nice
head
that
hung
around
for
a
little
while
head
was
tan
in
color
ale
itself
was
light
brown
in
color
had
a
slight
hop
smell
along
with
malt
and
a
slight
sweet
caramel
smell
all
and
all
very
light
tasted
verylight
also
nothing
really
overpowering
just
of
malt
hops
and
maybe
bread
had
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
and
left
that
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
felt
thin
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
good
i
dont
think
i
would
like
to
make
a
session
beer
out
of
this
one
to
dry
for
me
body
seems
a
bit
thin
its
smooth
in
in
the
mouth
light
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
this
ones
very
drinkable
good
flavor
but
it
lacks
a
little
in
some
other
categories
a
bit
more
wellrounded
would
have
made
it
excellent
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
giant
tan
frothy
head
the
head
is
very
large
with
great
lacing
that
lasts
the
smell
is
pungent
with
bread
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
hearty
for
a
pale
ale
with
bread
yeastsweet
maltcitrus
and
bitter
hops
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
very
well
this
is
a
flavor
filled
pale
ale
that
should
be
tried
by
all
cheers
this
has
mild
prickliness
and
is
wetting
to
the
palate
overall
a
pretty
well
balanced
pa
and
not
overly
hoppy
but
enough
to
keep
every
sip
interesting
d
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
and
if
i
was
going
to
knock
back
a
few
of
something
light
and
refreshing
this
could
be
a
go
to
brew
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
drinkability
is
high
there
is
an
acidic
finish
i
dont
want
to
say
bitter
its
relatively
mild
there
is
a
hint
of
some
nutty
character
overall
really
mild
the
acid
in
the
back
makes
this
beer
has
somewhat
of
an
odd
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
good
apa
great
drinkability
the
balance
again
makes
this
beer
medium
body
somewhat
creamy
easy
to
drink
and
good
to
but
ill
stick
with
other
stone
products
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
feels
like
it
may
be
lacking
in
body
just
a
little
this
still
comes
out
very
good
and
sessionable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
stone
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
would
go
very
well
with
a
piece
of
white
fish
or
poultry
very
simple
and
taste
very
good
i
will
for
sure
buy
this
again
and
or
order
it
if
ever
on
tap
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
could
almost
pass
for
a
lager
the
look
is
much
better
than
the
overall
taste
but
still
a
beer
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
a
good
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
has
a
creamy
feel
it
was
a
10
6pack
and
as
i
was
pouring
that
2nd
bottle
down
the
drain
it
felt
as
if
the
mostly
naked
hellboytype
character
silkscreened
onto
the
bottle
was
staring
at
me
and
saying
sucker
mfd
good
body
ample
carbonation
quite
drinkable
in
my
opinion
not
stones
best
beer
but
much
better
than
most
other
pale
ales
ive
tried
to
date
overall
unremarkable
compared
to
other
apas
and
to
other
stone
beers
worth
a
try
and
i
will
probably
get
it
again
the
next
time
i
am
looking
to
get
smashed
on
craft
beer
but
will
probably
not
drink
another
one
by
itself
d
gotta
give
stone
some
credit
for
their
unique
take
on
the
classic
pale
ale
but
this
really
didnt
resonate
with
me
the
hop
combo
created
an
odd
overly
resin
flavor
im
surprised
i
finally
found
a
stone
that
i
didnt
like
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
this
one
caramel
suggestions
throughout
entire
beer
hops
show
up
to
the
party
to
support
the
good
time
a
nice
example
of
an
apa
but
a
bit
too
pricey
imho
i
would
rather
drink
sierra
any
day
and
save
3
on
the
six
pack
i
am
pretty
new
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
most
of
my
life
i
have
drank
the
light
yellow
watery
fizzy
canned
beers
that
are
made
in
a
vat
the
size
of
rhode
island
that
get
berated
on
this
website
i
still
like
cheap
watery
beer
all
i
know
is
i
love
beer
and
this
is
what
i
want
my
beer
to
taste
like
sweet
and
herbal
citrusy
with
tons
of
pine
up
front
balanced
beutifully
with
just
the
right
smack
of
bitterness
its
plenty
hoppy
but
not
goofy
hoppy
its
just
great
beer
flavor
fantastic
drinkablility
i
just
wish
it
was
twoforone
at
the
tavern
like
my
light
yellow
fizzy
watery
crap
oh
well
the
beer
is
smooth
refreshing
with
some
caramel
flavors
some
graininess
underneath
a
touch
of
taut
and
citrusy
hop
to
add
some
zest
on
the
back
end
the
beer
is
creamy
a
bit
oily
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
acerbic
linger
into
the
finish
and
the
leafy
hop
dries
things
up
enough
to
make
this
interesting
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
the
citrus
acerbicness
is
actually
quite
nice
the
way
it
plays
off
the
grainy
malts
underneath
this
is
a
nice
beer
all
the
way
around
im
suprised
i
havent
tried
it
before
but
it
is
the
type
of
beer
you
see
quite
often
in
the
cooler
but
just
assume
youve
had
it
before
lchaim
full
and
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
tasty
and
drinkable
good
pale
ale
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
skin
the
aroma
was
lightly
malt
little
more
the
taste
was
on
the
weak
side
too
there
was
some
citrus
and
a
little
sugary
sweet
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
barely
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
session
beer
not
what
i
expected
from
stone
more
like
the
offering
from
a
lower
tier
brewery
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
there
is
some
nice
caramel
notes
with
ample
grapefruit
and
a
little
pine
the
taste
is
just
as
balanced
as
the
aroma
with
the
same
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
apa
but
nothing
spectacular
i
could
however
probably
session
this
and
thoroughly
enjoy
the
session
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
hoppier
than
the
style
average
more
ipalike
poured
not
so
pale
with
a
rich
amber
body
and
a
frothy
white
head
with
some
retention
and
a
few
spots
of
lace
restrained
aroma
of
grapefruit
berries
and
sweet
malt
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
dialled
back
ipa
nicely
balanced
taste
with
the
hops
more
toned
down
than
youd
expect
from
stone
some
good
sweet
malt
light
floral
notes
and
candied
grapefruit
certainly
an
easy
drinker
medium
body
and
carb
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
rather
sweet
for
my
taste
especially
in
this
style
im
sure
this
would
be
great
paired
with
something
unctuous
like
a
steak
or
bacon
taste
the
malt
is
a
kind
of
biscuity
hops
are
rather
laid
back
which
is
unusual
and
refreshing
to
see
from
a
californian
brewer
medium
hop
bitterness
this
is
one
you
can
definitely
enjoy
with
a
burger
at
lunch
without
feeling
too
sluggish
after
im
glad
this
one
was
kept
under
6
instead
of
making
a
beefy
pale
ale
like
dales
perfect
lunchtime
hamburger
beer
nice
malty
pale
ale
definitely
a
session
beer
d
a
damn
fine
apa
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
a
good
choice
if
it
were
local
id
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
about
the
citrusgrapefruit
hops
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
the
caramel
malts
and
the
citrus
hops
not
overpowered
in
either
respect
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
d
very
drinkable
pale
ale
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
smell
of
a
fresh
spring
meadow
wet
grassy
marsh
citrus
tones
were
subdued
as
were
the
hops
when
tasted
i
found
an
intense
bitter
shot
with
a
sharp
edge
followed
by
very
pronounced
malt
and
a
long
dry
finish
very
refreshing
clean
drinking
lightly
hopped
and
lighter
in
body
as
well
yet
everything
a
pale
ale
should
be
this
is
a
good
example
of
where
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
score
high
as
it
all
comes
together
quite
well
simple
and
understated
wish
i
bought
more
d
great
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
a
slight
roasted
malt
taste
mixed
with
hops
sweet
caramel
and
it
has
a
hint
of
spice
as
well
as
a
grainy
or
earthy
touch
to
it
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
while
it
might
not
be
a
very
hoppy
pale
ale
or
have
the
abv
punch
of
other
stone
brews
its
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
and
i
suggest
picking
up
a
six
pack
very
hop
forward
for
a
pale
ale
crisp
floral
citrus
hops
with
lots
of
lemon
peel
grapefruit
and
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
the
malt
presence
is
pretty
prominent
for
the
style
as
well
crisp
and
quaffable
with
a
slight
pine
dry
hoppy
finish
drinkability
a
lighter
pale
ale
with
avg
abv
its
not
a
bad
beer
deff
worth
a
try
drinkability
goes
down
as
easy
as
most
pale
ales
but
is
a
surefire
step
down
for
stone
considering
it
doesnt
pack
a
big
punch
imo
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
was
expecting
a
more
hoppy
offering
from
stone
but
they
nailed
this
one
anyhow
drinkability
while
not
my
all
time
favorite
apa
as
the
bros
stated
this
is
stones
pay
the
bills
beer
it
really
is
suited
for
all
tastes
its
not
a
bad
one
either
as
far
as
pale
ales
goes
this
is
very
balanced
and
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
bland
way
its
not
over
hopped
or
too
intense
a
great
overall
beer
the
beer
that
showed
me
the
light
once
again
brightens
up
my
day
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
earthy
malt
hops
and
slight
grain
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
hops
sweet
malt
slight
smokey
flavor
and
slight
grain
overall
not
a
hop
bomb
of
a
pale
ale
but
instead
a
rather
good
blend
the
smokeygrain
flavor
nicely
offsets
the
dryness
of
the
hops
better
than
average
apa
worth
a
try
p
s
my
first
ever
stone
brew
and
im
rather
pleased
i
think
i
will
have
to
drink
a
few
more
of
these
before
i
really
have
a
handle
on
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
its
quite
good
but
a
bit
richer
than
other
pale
ales
im
used
to
i
have
an
idea
once
im
used
to
it
it
will
be
quite
drinkable
indeed
i
liked
it
at
least
as
a
session
beer
it
certainly
doesnt
have
the
character
of
other
stone
brews
but
shows
some
admirable
restraint
and
it
would
be
easy
to
knock
a
few
of
these
back
on
a
hot
sunny
day
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
with
lots
of
taste
d
pretty
good
might
buy
again
but
then
again
i
might
not
nothing
to
complain
about
though
to
be
honest
spending
11
for
6
of
these
is
hard
when
6
snpas
is
only
9
but
it
wasnt
money
wasted
i
drank
this
along
with
a
smuttynose
shoals
pale
ale
as
a
comparison
next
let
me
say
this
iswas
the
first
stone
brew
that
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
next
to
no
head
retention
and
no
lacing
malt
was
cloying
especially
when
sampled
back
to
back
with
the
shoals
the
stone
had
a
koolaid
sweetness
to
the
malt
and
was
less
hoppy
then
the
smutty
and
didnt
balance
out
as
nicely
the
stone
was
all
sweetness
with
no
bitterness
maybe
an
old
bottle
not
a
typical
stone
brew
doesnt
live
up
to
the
scores
here
imho
especially
when
compared
directly
to
other
apas
excellent
lightmedium
bodied
stone
quafable
d
this
is
a
nice

beer
from
stone

it
their

its

well
its
pretty
good
if
not
ever
so
slightly
underwhelming
it
had
a
different
earthy
flavor
characteristic
with
a
nice
roasted
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
winter
warmers
the
appearance
was
definitely
better
than
allot
of
apas
ive
had
and
one
could
probably
drink
23
pints
of
this
tasty
brew
i
think
i
would
have
appreciated
a
slightly
fuller
more
slick
of
a
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
sessionable
very
tasty
cheers
d
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
stone
has
a
reputation
for
massively
hopping
their
beers
but
this
was
less
hoppy
than
expected
the
sweet
malts
provided
a
strong
base
and
the
hops
were
pleasantly
bitter
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hoppiness
but
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
one
that
i
would
gladly
session
d
this
is
a
stone
that
can
be
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
drink
up
very
mild
and
very
easy
drinking
will
have
again
got
to
love
stones
bottle
my
gf
asked
if
i
was
drinking
the
devils
beer
the
appearance
is
red
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
smell
is
oakish
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
rather
bitter
for
a
pale
ale
but
is
very
smooth
drinking
this
is
a
quality
beer
great
for
the
style
and
relatively
cheap
poured
from
bottle
into
an
ale
glass
2
fingers
of
slightly
tan
foam
with
pretty
lacing
good
clear
and
definitive
amber
appearance
smells
like
you
want
beer
to
smell
like
malty
with
hint
of
hops
and
vegatable
smells
taste
roasted
grain
and
some
chocolate
undertone
it
fills
the
mouth
with
flavor
and
feels
full
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
long
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
i
first
drank
it
in
sd
a
while
back
and
buy
it
whenever
i
find
it
available
a
pleasant
sweet
roasted
malt
taste
races
across
the
palate
followed
quickly
by
a
nice
balancing
of
hops
finishing
with
a
slightly
bitter
hoppiness
left
in
mouth
a
very
balanced
beer
the
malt
lingers
while
the
hops
take
over
never
losing
either
flavor
a
medium
body
matched
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
make
this
a
very
good
beer
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
to
introduce
people
to
craft
beer
with
drinkability
this
is
an
exceptionally
blended
apa
the
hops
and
malt
just
dance
with
each
other
very
sessionable
especially
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
stones
better
offerings
this
one
pours
an
orange
copper
color
that
is
closer
to
what
youd
expect
from
a
red
ale
a
half
inch
of
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
tastes
primarily
of
malt
with
a
moderate
does
of
citrus
in
there
leans
closer
to
a
red
ale
in
flavor
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
and
the
flavor
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
carbonation
is
just
right
and
this
is
very
drinkable
a
solid
pale
ale
but
nothing
extraordinary
well
balanced
d
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
one
of
the
most
flavorful
brews
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
tried
single
from
westover
market
arlington
va
d
all
in
all
another
good
brew
by
stone
but
nothing
too
special
still
beats
the
hell
out
of
most
of
the
apas
out
there
this
is
a
very
drinkable
very
balanced
pale
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
had
drinkability
i
just
grabbed
this
out
of
the
fridge
after
cutting
the
lawn
and
im
glad
i
did
ive
never
bought
this
before
because
ive
always
gone
for
stones
bigger
offerings
this
is
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
and
it
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
else
a
real
nice
apa
d
overall
great
beer
to
drink
and
have
a
lot
of
recommended
d
wellbalanced
with
some
nice
flavors
going
on
im
generally
not
too
huge
on
pale
ales
but
this
is
a
solid
offering
and
could
definitely
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
probably
the
mildest
of
the
stone
brews
that
ive
tried
but
another
good
one
nonetheless
drinkability
easily
sessionable
as
the
alcohol
is
mild
and
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
great
with
a
light
bbq
or
simply
having
a
few
just
not
something
i
would
open
on
a
special
occasion
as
the
hops
just
arent
strong
enough
to
be
my
cup
of
tea
d
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
ale
in
this
case
not
really
bad
but
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
may
buy
one
more
down
the
road
to
see
if
this
was
a
old
batch
but
would
much
rather
have
a
dales
pale
snpa
or
many
other
pas
before
this
one
have
had
this
on
many
occassions
but
most
recently
at
the
flying
saucer
houston
review
from
notes
taken
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appears
a
orangebrown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
very
fruity
in
the
aroma
with
lots
of
citrus
combined
with
caramel
toffee
and
other
frutis
i
cant
tell
all
mixed
together
starts
of
with
malty
sweetnes
and
ends
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitter
finish
awesome
pale
ale
a
recommended
simple
pale
ale
thats
well
constructed
and
smooth
had
this
in
a
bottle
at
grechs
millbrook
inn
in
pond
eddy
ny
not
too
much
head
smell
was
fairly
light
with
caramel
notes
tasted
similar
almost
gingery
but
light
and
watery
very
lightly
hopped
decent
ale
would
make
a
good
session
beer
not
overwhelming
easy
drinking
a
good
session
beer
for
those
that
prefer
a
dry
pale
ale
pours
coppery
with
a
good
fluffy
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
if
anything
woody
like
the
freshly
cut
branch
of
a
sapling
theres
a
little
pale
malt
in
there
with
some
earthy
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
bready
and
slightly
woody
with
floral
and
earthy
hops
the
one
thing
that
is
unmistakably
stone
is
the
sharp
bitter
bite
at
the
end
that
speaks
of
the
brewerys
strong
touch
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
robust
and
thick
though
not
viscous
in
the
least
could
drink
it
for
a
while
delicious
stuff
this
and
their
ipa
are
my
go
to
beers
great
beer
stone
an
excellent
beer
a
staple
for
pale
ales
for
sure
d
a
very
good
pale
ale
indeed
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
most
likely
in
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
single
give
it
a
try
theres
not
much
to
take
away
from
this
ones
drink
ability
it
certainly
ought
to
be
tried
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
amber
with
a
hint
of
orange
nice
thick
head
of
foam
this
beer
has
a
nice
nose
and
a
very
interesting
taste
a
great
balance
between
the
sweet
and
bitter
a
lot
of
pales
make
the
mistake
and
have
way
too
much
of
a
malt
taste
but
not
this
just
enough
all
in
all
a
great
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
ill
definately
go
back
to
taste
is
of
oats
malt
grain
some
caramel
a
little
bit
of
cheerios
earth
and
roasted
nuts
ends
a
little
dry
and
a
little
bitter
purchased
from
rays
liquors
in
wauwatosa
wi
poured
bright
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
i
detected
a
faint
hop
aroma
lightbodied
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
tasted
a
very
mild
sweetness
and
small
hop
aftertaste
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
and
i
could
drink
2
or
3
in
a
row
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
but
one
i
might
buy
again
great
beer
servered
from
a
tap
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
small
head
and
decent
lacing
strong
citrus
hops
smell
very
well
balanced
beer
great
hop
taste
very
smooth
with
medium
body
great
overall
beer
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
for
around
2
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
bone
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
orange
lemon
followed
by
lightly
toasted
grains
and
spicy
caramel
malt
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
with
a
crisp
finish
a
decent
go
to
pale
ale
d
it
is
a
good
meaty
american
apa
i
am
so
used
to
a
chock
full
hop
brews
from
stone
brewing
this
is
a
nice
and
tasty
change
drinkability
great
everyday
beer
ill
add
it
to
the
rotation
the
abv
is
ok
for
the
style
unfortunately
the
price
is
more
than
snpa
and
even
more
than
torpedo
in
most
stores
as
a
result
im
going
to
have
to
go
with
torpedo
as
the
better
beer
unless
im
in
a
session
drinking
sitation
bye
pumpkin
colored
amazing
frothy
head
i
would
have
expected
more
hops
out
of
this
beer
but
its
really
mild
and
subdued
empahsis
on
the
malt
toasted
caramel
with
floral
hops
toffee
brown
sugar
and
orange
all
in
one
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
from
california
theres
actually
malt
in
this
one
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
dense
white
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
a
nice
grassy
hop
aroma
also
some
sweet
malt
aromas
mostly
hops
up
front
both
grassy
and
citrus
hop
flavors
there
is
also
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
that
comes
through
not
as
strong
in
the
hops
as
an
ipa
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
there
is
a
good
bitterness
to
the
finish
and
it
lingers
for
a
while
good
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
accentuates
its
maltiness
rather
any
significant
hop
character
had
a
pint
of
this
tonight
at
a
local
pizza
joint
but
this
isnt
my
first
time
its
pretty
ok
and
not
too
memorable
i
liked
its
dark
amber
color
and
moderately
malty
and
hoppy
smell
the
taste
is
mild
at
most
and
characterized
by
its
sweet
malt
profile
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
ive
had
better
that
offer
a
richer
drinking
experience
sierra
nevada
comes
to
mind
still
an
above
average
beer
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
but
will
suffice
when
options
are
limited
drinkability
very
drinkable
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
have
a
few
of
these
d
this
is
all
i
drink
at
padre
games
just
wanted
to
see
how
it
was
in
bottle
i
like
this
beer
and
i
think
its
a
choice
pale
ale
but
coming
from
stone
id
expect
something
bolder
hoppier
andor
more
asskicking
but
this
came
with
so
much
sweetness
im
thinking
the
gargoyle
on
the
bottle
needs
a
tutu
and
a
training
bra
drinkability
solid
in
this
department
for
sure
the
wellbalanced
nature
lends
itself
to
easy
drinking
and
the
moderate
abv
makes
it
borderline
sessionable
poured
a
nice
copperred
with
three
finger
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
malts
mostly
with
citrus
overtones
same
goes
for
taste
citrusy
with
a
malty
flavor
with
hops
being
on
the
backburner
for
this
one
very
smooth
and
light
for
a
stone
brew
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
for
me
but
its
not
bad
easily
could
be
a
session
brew
had
this
on
tap
with
bbq
nice
look
with
a
good
head
smell
was
decent
taste
was
crisp
with
some
hops
and
a
hint
of
fruit
malty
very
good
mouth
feel
does
not
leave
a
cotton
mouth
feel
not
too
filling
good
with
food
this
beer
is
deceptive
as
it
can
creep
up
on
you
in
terms
of
alcohol
first
beer
i
liked
from
this
brewery
which
is
good
cause
i
like
to
support
ca
brews
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
redtinged
copper
color
with
a
massive
fluffy
threefinger
head
the
smell
is
some
caramel
malt
with
some
fragrant
floral
and
leafy
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
toffeecaramel
malt
sweetness
that
gradually
fades
into
some
wellbalanced
hops
with
some
floral
and
slightly
piney
and
well
as
citrusy
character
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
oily
with
some
subdued
carbonation
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
for
the
amount
of
hops
it
uses
a
testament
to
the
ability
of
a
good
beer
to
balance
out
the
hops
and
the
malt
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
musttry
for
anyone
interested
in
it
good
pale
not
over
hopped
and
nicely
balanced
d
this
is
a
big
difference
from
ruination
i
really
enjoyed
the
malt
dominance
in
this
pale
ale
another
great
stone
brew
d
overall
a
nice
working
man
brew
from
a
killer
brewing
company
beer
is
very
enjoyable
i
tuned
my
brain
to
hops
this
trip
and
hvent
been
disappointed
so
far
im
almost
tired
of
giving
stone
constant
validation
for
making
kickass
beer
thats
just
something
ive
come
to
expect
of
them
i
think
their
pale
ale
speaks
volumes
for
the
brewery
which
promotes
itself
on
making
big
and
bold
products
the
fact
that
they
can
still
offer
something
mild
and
balanced
proves
the
brewer
is
just
as
talented
as
he
is
arrogant
heavy
balanced
flavors
with
nice
lightness
low
abv
means
i
can
drink
lots
of
these
unobtrusive
no
extreme
flavors
to
clash
with
d
lots
of
malts
and
a
tease
of
hop
to
make
this
easy
to
kick
back
a
few
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
creamy
graywhitish
head
good
lacing
and
seems
to
last
very
mild
aroma
some
nuttiness
maybe
some
dark
grapes
fizzy
smooth
not
creamy
some
nutiness
some
balance
some
dustiness
mild
some
kind
of
fruit
in
tne
taste
but
not
dark
fruit
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
hoppiness
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
floral
hops
but
it
was
not
too
strong
the
taste
started
off
with
a
malty
sweetness
which
was
in
great
balance
with
the
hops
had
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
very
easy
drinking
well
balanced
pale
ale
a
great
session
beer
imo
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
ok
lacing
is
good
the
aroma
is
very
nice
it
smells
like
bready
malt
citrusy
orange
and
grassy
hops
and
also
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
bready
malt
and
some
piney
hops
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
in
this
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
choice
as
a
session
beer
as
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
it
has
plenty
of
taste
and
its
not
too
high
in
abv
so
you
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
id
definitely
buy
this
again
its
a
good
quality
classic
beer
overall
good
but
i
dont
think
it
compares
to
sierra
nevada
in
this
category
fairly
drinkable
though
hazy
redamber
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
off
white
head
with
low
retention
nose
smells
of
fruity
citrus
hops
with
orange
and
light
floral
notes
tastes
of
citrusy
hops
with
sweet
malty
background
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
fairly
high
carbonation
another
beer
i
couldnt
have
more
than
a
few
of
given
the
high
carbonation
i
have
a
noticably
fresher
sample
look
and
aroma
are
about
the
same
but
i
can
detect
more
of
a
flavorful
hop
presense
nothing
outrageous
but
it
does
blend
better
with
the
malt
the
feel
definitely
has
more
carbonation
perhaps
a
perfect
amount
not
too
fizzy
or
soft
drinks
very
nice
good
balance
i
was
not
let
down
by
stones
version
of
a
pale
ale
this
was
excellent
and
very
drinkable
i
was
expecting
it
to
have
too
much
of
one
flavor
but
didnt
definitely
worth
the
money
this
is
something
i
will
drink
again
in
the
near
future
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
apa
and
its
incredibly
wellbalanced
surprisingly
so
for
a
stone
offering
in
fact
im
impressed
but
not
blown
away
still
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
anytime
overall
is
a
good
light
highly
drinkable
apa
would
recommend
to
people
just
getting
into
beers
with
generous
amounts
of
hops
poured
fresh
growler
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
transferred
into
a
smaller
form
killer
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
are
noticed
first
followed
by
some
of
that
w
c
hops
gulp
very
mild
and
sweet
on
the
intake
frothy
as
well
little
thickness
makes
for
some
great
aftertaste
drinkability
is
favorable
for
a
pale
ale
the
combination
of
the
maltiness
and
the
hops
are
perfectly
portioned
embracing
for
those
who
find
hoppy
beer
overwhelming
this
is
a
stellar
sunshine
beer
in
my
opinion
stone
never
disappoints
and
for
that
this
one
comes
recommended
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
overall
though
there
are
of
course
better
ones
out
there
at
around
the
same
price
for
a
six
pack
id
just
as
well
go
with
their
ipa
though
cheers
d
off
the
chart
this
is
a
great
beer
and
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
i
must
admit
i
have
a
cultlike
devotion
to
the
stone
brewery
i
love
their
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
a
little
pricey
around
my
way
but
a
good
pale
ale
overall
not
quite
your
prototypical
pale
ale
dales
pale
ale
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
good
sweeter
and
more
complex
than
most
pale
ales
notes
of
caramel
and
toasted
sweetness
citrusy
hops
taste
is
very
chewy
with
multilayered
flavors
starting
with
big
malts
right
up
front
with
very
vibrant
hops
kicking
in
midpalate
and
electrifying
it
and
then
a
long
oily
finish
with
an
evergreen
hop
profile
that
makes
me
think
of
gin
very
round
and
balanced
this
beer
reaffirms
stones
status
as
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
the
west
coast
seems
a
bit
closer
to
an
esb
than
a
pale
nice
either
way
though
future
outlook
excellent
session
beer
that
i
would
certainly
never
avoid
next
time
heavy
relatively
mindless
drinking
is
afoot
this
will
be
a
consideration
beer
is
a
beautiful
semitransparent
dark
ambercopper
color
with
a
good
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
only
brief
lacing
particularly
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
loved
the
aromas
in
this
beer
initially
sweet
malts
balanced
out
with
hops
taste
is
similar
at
first
a
long
sip
featured
brief
malts
at
the
beginning
ending
in
bitter
grainy
hops
this
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
smooth
on
the
palate
coating
my
whole
mouth
with
bitter
residues
the
only
downside
for
me
here
was
that
after
the
first
or
second
sip
the
hops
started
to
take
over
completely
making
the
beer
more
unbalanced
and
less
flavorful
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
overall
though
this
is
a
strong
an
ale
as
i
would
expect
from
stone
id
easily
recommend
it
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
and
understated
beer
from
stone
and
the
drinkability
is
high
as
there
is
nothing
overthetop
about
this
one
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
very
good
beer
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
that
wont
knock
you
out
with
strong
flavors
or
alcohol
highly
recommended
as
an
everyday
drinker
this
is
very
drinkable
for
me
and
makes
a
good
session
beer
ill
have
another
please
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
for
me
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
sn
celebration
and
hopslam
so
it
was
nice
to
have
a
beer
with
less
bite
light
orangebrown
in
color
fully
transparent
has
minimal
bubble
beads
but
the
average
sized
head
lingers
well
with
a
fine
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
but
not
excessively
so
more
roast
to
it
than
sweet
caramel
slips
you
wheat
and
grain
not
fruity
nor
spicy
perhaps
a
trace
of
lemon
peel
relaxed
and
streamlined
rather
than
aggressive
light
to
mediumbodied
same
basic
profile
in
the
mouth
of
hops
grains
wheat
and
bitters
mild
citrus
tones
dry
mouth
feel
with
the
carbonation
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
flavors
gossamer
caramel
to
coffee
hard
candy
flavors
succinct
finish
doesnt
appear
short
just
ends
on
a
dime
d
i
could
definitely
kick
back
a
few
of
these
alcohol
content
isnt
too
high
a
decent
brew
overall
drinkability
not
fast
a
slow
drinking
pale
ale
not
as
great
as
other
stone
beers
but
not
disappointing
drinkability
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
wasnt
nearly
as
full
as
i
would
have
expected
i
might
try
another
bottle
at
some
point
just
to
make
sure
my
palates
not
off
but
my
comments
seem
to
be
in
line
with
most
of
the
reviews
great
drinking
apa
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
due
to
the
balance
in
the
brew
and
the
relatively
low
abv
this
is
a
good
choice
for
a
session
brew
quite
a
good
pale
ale
lacked
the
body
i
usually
think
of
in
a
pale
ale
but
still
quite
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
reddishcopper
in
color
with
almost
two
fingers
of
creamy
almost
pillowy
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
good
aroma
touch
subdued
but
with
a
solid
citrus
hop
presence
but
a
fair
amount
of
toasty
bready
malt
taste
is
fairly
good
as
well
starts
out
moderately
hoppy
with
a
fair
amount
of
toastybready
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
citrus
hop
flavor
builds
and
soon
overwhelms
the
malt
as
a
very
solid
bitterness
becomes
evident
clean
fermentation
character
lingering
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
pretty
solid
apa
and
would
probably
go
over
pretty
well
with
just
about
anyone
drinkability
stone
knows
how
to
brew
beer
like
i
said
this
is
my
first
stone
and
it
wont
be
my
last
ive
read
that
their
other
selections
are
more
kickinthebutt
hoppy
but
this
one
was
very
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
bitter
sweetness
finish
is
quenching
yum
slick
and
easy
to
drinksession
pours
a
pleasant
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
light
hop
smell
with
some
bread
taste
is
much
breadier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
little
bit
of
lemon
spice
minimal
malt
backbone
good
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
one
as
well
overall
this
is
a
great
session
beer
to
sip
on
whether
at
home
or
at
a
tailgate
a
solid
beer
from
stone
and
quite
sessionable
reddish
brown
pourwith
a
huge
light
tan
head
that
slowly
went
down
to
a
thin
ring
and
stayed
till
the
end
a
nice
subtle
hop
aromawith
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
of
hopsmaltand
bread
dough
with
the
amount
of
malt
here
you
would
expect
it
to
be
sweeter
but
instead
it
has
just
a
nice
dry
hop
finishand
i
think
i
detected
a
slight
alcohol
taste
at
the
end
very
good
will
buy
again
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
stone
pale
ale
wheres
the
hops
definitely
slanted
towards
the
malt
and
its
easy
to
see
why
sierra
nevada
pa
is
the
standard
decent
enough
but
its
easy
to
get
lost
in
the
wash
of
american
pale
ales
and
this
one
gets
lost
in
the
wash
not
worth
the
price
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
some
time
but
have
been
prevented
by
its
limited
availablility
in
my
area
i
understand
that
this
is
their
flagship
beer
and
it
is
indeed
a
good
one
it
exhibits
many
of
the
characteristics
of
their
bigger
badder
siblings
in
a
much
more
subdued
way
this
is
one
that
i
would
recommend
to
some
of
my
friends
new
to
better
beer
or
who
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
stone
product
i
also
would
definately
buy
a
case
of
this
to
have
in
the
house
when
not
in
the
mood
for
ruination
or
a
bastard

is
it
different
this
time
around
or
is
it
the
taster
i
dont
know
but
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
more
of
everything
in
this
beer
than
i
remember
very
nice
and
i
hope
what
i
taste
this
evening
is
what
i
taste
next
time
very
balanced
and
light
on
the
palate
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
one
of
the
top
apas
that
i
have
tasted
d
very
drinkable
beer
solid
pale
ale
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
put
a
lot
of
this
back
very
drinkable
the
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
cereal
and
citrus
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
bitter
but
balanced
with
caramel
the
palate
is
smooth
but
not
thick
overall
its
a
good
session
beer
without
being
a
tremendous
beer
still
a
good
solid
drinking
beer
any
day
d
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavors
for
me
arent
preferable
they
are
just
average
and
interesting
so
i
wouldnt
have
drank
much
more
than
the
one
i
had
i
like
pale
ale
and
i
like
this
beer
pours
clear
copper
with
a
medium
white
head
cascade
hop
and
crystal
malt
aroma
with
some
caramel
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
the
taste
more
hops
and
malt
than
the
others
with
a
tart
aftertaste
this
can
be
inconsistent
sometimes
being
a
bit
tangy
and
others
sweet
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
might
be
a
very
good
beer
to
provide
as
an
intro
to
the
craft
beer
world
and
i
dont
mean
that
to
slight
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
smells
great
lots
of
light
fruity
flowery
aroma
pours
a
copperamber
with
a
bubbly
head
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sierra
nevadas
brew
lots
of
light
fruit
citrus
apricot
some
peach
lots
of
malt
only
a
bit
of
hops
very
good
stuff
here
weird
to
come
away
from
a
stone
beer
and
not
be
blown
away
but
ive
had
better
pale
ales
although
theres
hardly
anything
to
feel
let
down
about
either
crisp
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkable
enough
though
i
might
not
want
several
good
beer
all
around
d
enjoyable
perfect
for
having
with
a
meal
in
the
afternoon
as
a
preamble
to
some
heavier
stuff
waiting
in
the
wings
overall
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
however
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
it
a
lot
because
of
its
high
price
here
in
florida

a
sixpack
id
rather
spend
my
money
on
stones
exceptional
beers
stone
pale
ale
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
nice
if
not
particularly
aggresive
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
are
evident
there
is
a
toasted
malt
quality
to
the
flavor
which
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
hops
first
time
ive
seen
this
in
oregon
as
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
i
had
to
try
this
one
pours
full
amber
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
minimal
lacings
aroma
is
quite
bold
caramel
and
floral
hops
this
is
a
restrained
pa
from
a
company
best
known
for
their
big
hop
beers
actually
i
think
the
hops
seem
less
bold
because
of
the
large
amount
of
tasty
malts
in
this
brew
anyway
i
appreciate
the
balance
of
this
beer
thanks
stone
for
making
a
well
rounded
very
drinkable
apa
i
just
wish
its
price
was
closer
to
deschutes
mirror
pond
ah
well
there
is
shipping
and
distance
to
big
added
i
live
about
120
miles
from
bend
and
more
like
1000
mi
to
escondido
the
town
which
was
the
butt
of
fred
sanfords
jokes
on
many
occassions
d
very
high
the
price
is
the
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
out
of
the
mainstream
very
drinkable
beer
that
needs
to
sit
for
a
few
minutes
to
be
appreciated
i
would
definitely
buy
this
regularly
if
it
were
a
little
cheaper
but
at
what
i
paid
for
it
ill
be
sticking
to
laughing
dog
as
my
regular
goto
pale
ale
d
very
much
i
like
the
way
stone
has
interpreted
this
style
especially
since
it
is
so
misinterpreted
in
the
united
states
appears
a
ruddy
copper
colour
with
two
fingers
of
pockmarked
white
head
which
disappears
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
slightly
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
cereal
grain
malt
with
a
light
pine
hop
essence
there
is
an
aboveaverage
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
quick
finish
this
is
the
mildest
product
from
stone
that
ive
had
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
still
fullbodied
and
sessionable
i
would
imagine
whats
this
a
basic
pale
ale
by
stone
well
knowing
this
would
be
good
based
on
never
having
a
mediocre
brew
from
these
guys
i
didnt
hesitate
on
getting
this
one
anything
but
basic
this
apa
excells
all
of
my
expectations
aroma
is
incredibly
malty
well
backed
by
some
calm
hops
beautiful
pour
rich
color
large
head
that
sticks
around
and
thick
lacing
the
huge
malt
is
easily
felt
this
is
thick
and
full
for
this
style
fantastic
taste
still
cant
believe
how
malty
this
one
is
the
hops
are
very
mellow
well
received
although
not
expected
considering
this
brewers
appetite
for
extremes
all
around
great
brew
very
drinkable
could
make
a
wonderful
session
beer
nice
offering
from
stone
not
my
favorite
but
still
a
great
beer
it
seems
clear
that
they
pulled
back
a
bit
on
the
hops
for
this
one
perhaps
trying
to
appeal
to
larger
audience
overall
the
balance
is
still
very
good
with
a
great
hop
highlight
cheers
to
stone
carbonation
was
good
it
was
a
solid
beer
not
as
special
as
other
stone
offerings
maybe
this
was
lowered
a
little
though
due
to
higher
expectations
of
stone
beers
i
would
drink
this
one
again
but
there
would
be
a
lot
more
in
front
of
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
a
frothy
and
not
too
persistent
head
aroma
is
strong
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
leaning
towards
malt
flavor
is
surprisingly
hoppy
but
not
quite
like
an
ipa
malt
and
hops
contribute
equally
to
the
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
texture
is
smooth
and
delightful
drinkability
easily
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
totally
refreshing
i
dont
often
go
for
apas
but
this
one
is
worth
a
revisit
stone
comes
to
maine
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
it
had
a
floral
aroma
nice
piney
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
malt
presence
assertive
without
being
intrusive
nice
drinkable
beer
will
buy
more
of
these
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
also
a
pretty
good
gateway
beer
because
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
this
will
become
a
regular
golden
pale
color
from
the
tap
served
in
apint
glass
with
a
small
white
frothy
head
tastes
of
a
faint
caramel
sweetness
does
have
some
mild
hops
but
not
bitter
a
bit
thin
on
the
backbone
kind
of
bland
but
went
very
well
with
pizza
would
be
a
great
choice
as
a
session
beer
with
most
any
meal
yet
another
friggin
great
beer
from
stone
this
is
a
wellbalanced
session
oriented
type
brew
very
tasty
smells
nice
but
needs
some
work
in
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
arenas
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
was
readily
available
in
central
wisconsin
it
is
nice
to
see
this
brewery
has
made
its
way
into
the
state
even
though
i
need
to
travel
almost
three
hours
to
get
a
six
pack
i
will
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
my
friends
ill
also
make
sure
they
get
their
own
because
this
sixer
is
mine
d
great
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
pours
a
nice
dark
nutty
color
with
very
little
head
smells
delicious
like
a
tasty
beer
maybe
a
hint
of
cloves
it
has
a
long
strong
hoppy
finish
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
complaining
stone
makes
some
good
beer
and
their
pale
ale
is
no
exception
theres
an
enjoyable
toastiness
with
a
bright
enough
hop
presence
to
keep
this
beer
flowing
thanks
for
the
sample
justin
d
this
is
a
good
session
beer
always
nice
to
throw
this
back
and
always
willing
had
it
again
a
year
later
with
a
bottle
i
had
saved
stored
fantastically
the
malt
really
came
out
and
the
nose
had
hints
of
pineapple
plum
and
watermelon
even
simple
very
low
alcohol
but
quite
broad
for
the
form
on
the
hefty
side
of
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
stones
pale
ale
is
a
fine
version
of
the
style
and
extremely
drinkable
nice
and
crisp
but
a
bit
watery
medium
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
good
session
brew
very
good
apa
that
i
will
visit
again
pours
orange
amber
with
a
fairly
short
head
that
fades
quickly
to
almost
nothing
smells
a
bit
of
juicyfruit
light
citrus
wax
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
similar
quite
juicy
and
with
quite
a
bit
of
malt
lack
the
graininess
that
is
sometimes
found
in
pale
ales
fairly
lightly
hopped
and
the
sweet
malt
more
than
balances
against
the
light
citrusy
hops
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
notes
no
let
down
here
not
at
their
best
herebut
simply
well
done
d
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
ones
worth
trying
definitely
not
stones
best
but
it
is
a
drinkable
pale
ale
and
among
their
most
sessionable
selections
deep
copper
amber
in
color
with
a
medium
head
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
down
the
glass
good
smell
that
is
leaning
more
toward
the
malt
than
anything
not
something
i
expected
from
a
stone
beer
toasted
caramel
toffee
and
a
subtle
fruit
lingering
in
the
nose
some
citrusy
hops
are
present
but
in
no
way
overpower
the
malt
upon
the
first
taste
it
seems
to
be
the
same
old
story
toasted
caramel
brown
sugar
toffee
a
light
toasted
bread
and
grain
fruit
is
still
present
the
hops
come
through
a
little
stronger
than
the
nose
may
have
suggested
though
not
until
you
get
toward
the
finish
they
provide
a
solid
bitterness
and
good
balance
to
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
good
but
and
balanced
as
well
never
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
just
in
between
the
two
could
have
used
a
touch
more
carbonation
but
otherwise
a
nice
feel
to
it
just
a
bit
too
full
textured
to
consider
it
a
sessionable
pale
ale
two
pints
would
be
my
limit
big
on
the
flavor
and
on
the
malt
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
not
enough
to
return
to
it
often
drinkability
great
love
it
the
beer
had
a
nice
amber
appearance
with
a
great
cream
head
smell
was
slightly
fruity
but
with
a
distinct
hopsy
sense
to
it
something
was
a
little
off
for
me
but
not
a
bad
smell
whatever
reservations
i
had
about
to
smell
were
put
to
bed
by
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
great
taste
stone
pale
ale
is
a
quality
pale
ale
man
i
love
stone
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
gorgeous
creamy
head
nose
is
fruity
and
sweet
tastes
like
stone
what
can
i
say
it
just
tastes
great
perfect
balance
probably
the
least
aggressive
stone
ive
had
a
little
more
accessible
to
multiple
bottles
in
one
sitting
i
may
like
more
carbonation
but
the
beer
is
great
either
way
this
and
sierra

my
favorite
pale

doubt

with

some

of
cascade
hops
with
some
caramel

also
discernable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
some
dominating
cascade
hops
which
provide
a
citrusy
and
bitter
taste
full
body
with
some
average
carbonation
good
but
drinkability
good
have
been
better
too
full
too
be
a
session
beer
and
too
light
in
terms
of
hops
to
be
truly
interesting
d
given
the
5
4
abv
and
the
fact
that
the
bitterness
isnt
overthetop
for
the
style
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
d
one
of
the
best
session
beers
i
can
think
of
extremely
well
balanced
not

intense

crisp

some
earthy
citrus

and
sweet

the
taste
was
a
decent
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
crisp
citrus
hops
the
beer
was
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
with
decent

would
certainly
make
a

and

a
great
session
beer
very
well
done
stone
is
fast
becoming
yet
another
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
they
really
seem
to
know
what
theyre
doing
when
it
comes
to
producing
the
amber
nectar
this
one
is
no
exception
a
finelooking
beer
with
a
good
head
that
gives
off
plenty
of
citrus
notes
plus
a
hint
of
bready
yeastiness
a
nice
balance
on
the
tongue
which
wont
scare
off
those
who
dont
like
anything
too
bitter
but
theres
a
very
nice
hoppy
finish
as
it
slides
down
the
back
of
the
throat
it
would
be
very
easy
to
knock
these
back
all
night
medium
bodied
the
hops
give
this
one
a
strong
rubyred
grapefruit
flavor
with
a
hint
of
malt
to
balance
it
out
leaves
thick
sticky
lacing
as
you
drink
good
mouthfeel
quite
balanced
and
tasty
not
the
boldest
of
beers
but
execution
is
exceptional
poured
with
a
nice
frothy
textured
head
and
lots
of
lace
nice
amber
color
mild
hop
with
some
malt
nose
hop
flavor
is
remarkably
muted
not
bad
but
nothing
special
a
surprise
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
the
stone
balanced
clean
pleasant
finish
very
drinkable
although
it
doesnt
hold
up
as
it
warms
better
than
most
pale
ales
ive
tried
its
similar
to
a
lot
of
others
but
the
execution
is
a
step
above
picked
this
one
up
at
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
va
copperamber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
and
some
really
nice
lacing
aroma
is

and
some
floral
hops
not
strong
but
decent
caramel
malty
flavor
a
little
bit
grainy
floral
with
a
citrus
hop
bite
very
well
balanced
a
solid
beer
but
i
expect
nothing
less
from
stone
pours
a
hazy

with
a
small
beige

is
very
hoppy
with

andlight
cocoa
finishes
abruptly
and
nicely
bitter
medium

a
more
normally
bittered
beer
from
stone
d
definitely
drinkable
not
at
the
absolute
top
of
my
pale
ale
chart
but
solid
nonetheless
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
that
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
aging
i
love
hops
but
this
interpretation
of
a
pale
is
arguably
has
just
a
bit
too
much
hop
bitterness
still
a
very
solid
pale
ale
very
rich
and
with
a
reasonable
abv

could
easily
have
a

of
these

this

fades
into
a
delicate

will

very
drinkable
light
enough
for
a
hot

character
enough
for
any
casual
drinking
not
an
especially
unique
beer
but
a
very
wellmade
example
of
a
americanstyled
pale
ale
overall
youll
be
sorry
if
you
buy
only
one
bottle
had
a
bottle
3
months
shy
of
its
best
by
date
strongly
bitter
flavor
in
a
grapefruit
rind
kind
of
way
with
hints
of
arrogant
bastard
in
the
finish
not
balanced
enough
to
be
sessionable
quite
aggressive
enjoyable
still
would
give
it
a
4
25
as
a
had
great
hop
flavor
without
encroaching
on
an
ipa
in
terms
of
bitterness
like
some
pale
ales
do
great
malt
profile
to
boot
until
now
i
had
only
had
big
beers
from
stone
so
i
was
surprised
at
how
subdued
the
hops
are
in
this
pale
ale
it
is
pretty
simple
but
very
drinkable
very
quaffable
overall
stone
pale
ale
is
another
solid
beer
from
this
outstanding
brewery
recommended
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
nice
balance
and
body
to
it
complex
without
being
off
the
charts
a
terrific
session
beer
it
was
a
little
darker
and
thicker
than
i
expected
for
a
pale
ale
but
it
still
worked
quite
well
standard
sessionable
pale
ale
very
drinkable
and
will
seek
out
as
standard
bold
flavor
very
malty
and
bready
dried
citrus
rindpeels
moderately
fullbodied
spicy
hop
finish
adds
an
element
of
complexity
along
with
a
tealike
quality
dry
somewhat
bitter
finish
that
kept
me
going
back
for
another
sip
very
balanced
and
integrated
flavors
pretty
enjoyable
and
session
worthy
the
taste
nice
malty
mouthfeel
then
the
hops
come
and
spice
up
the
finish
this
beer
has
more
malt
and
mouthfeel
than
fat
tire
and
they
call
that
a
amber
ale
cheers
to
stone
even
if
this
is
there
bottom
of
the
line
entry
level
beer
this
just
shows
there
runt
is
better
than
most
brews
best
offering
o
very
very
good
beer
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
gives
it
a
great
character
and
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
one
was
even
better
than
i
was
expecting
poured
a
reddish
colour
with
an
eggshell
coloured
head
reminded
me
of
hopdevil
actually
smell
was
nice
with
a
candy
sweetness
and
an
equal
measure
of
floral
hops
taste
was
terrific
due
to
the
fact
that
the
hops
were
turned
down
quite
a
bit
they
were
there
and
certainly
noticeable
but
not
quite
so
in
your
face
over
the
top
as
seems
to
be
the
way
any
micro
pale
ale
is
these
days
this
was
a
very
flavourful
pale
ale
with
a
pleasant
smell
and
easy
to
drink
what
more
do
you
need
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
about
the
weight
i
would
expect
considering
the
style
dazzlingly
drinkable
i
cant
wait
for
stone
to
be
available
in
ga
this
will
be
a
frequent
purchase
delicious
and
not
quite
so
assertive
wonderful
i
can
do
a
couple
of
these
and
thats
it
tough
food
match
too
a
sold
well
built
beer
but
has
some
oddities
nothing
bad
strong
recommendation
but
not
the
polished
product
youd
expect
poured
a
pretty
amber
orange
with
a
huge
frothy
tan
head
there
isnt
that
much
carbonation
clinging
to
the
glass
some
nice
lacing
is
beginning
to
develop
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
fruity
and
quite
malty
same
goes
for
the
taste
the
hops
certainly
take
the
back
seat
in
this
stone
ale
its
certainly
not
a
very
complex
brew
but
its
nice
i
could
see
it
being
a
good
session
brew
the
feel
is
slick
and
moderate
very
drinkable
but
may
get
boring
after
a
few
d
very
good
here
the
abv
is
appropriate
for
sessions
and
this
is
indeed
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
good
beer
to
quaff
all
night
long
drinkability
is
highoften
gets
lost
for
me
when
presented
with
a
bigger
stone
beerhowever
a
very
solid
beer
overall
an
exceptionally
enjoyable
beer
the
arrogant
bastard
which
i
love
is
enjoyable
in
a
challenging
sense
like
climbing
up
a
mountain
the
pale
ale
is
enjoyable
like
spending
a
day
at
the
beach
delicious
d
pretty
mild
for
a
west
coast
pale
real
euro
in
terms
of
hops
and
flavor
intensity
d
drinks
well
but
its
almost
too
sweet
to
have
too
much
of
the
alcohol
is
a
little
high
but
bearable
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
too
many
of
these
but
its
still
pretty
good
and
ill
buy
it
again
this
one
is
drinkable
despite
that
metallic
taste
and
at
5
4
abv
it
qualifies
as
a
session
ale
i
expected
more
from
stone
as
this
is
the
flagship
but
it
is
worth
trying
nice
malt
sweetness
quite
balanced
given
stones
usual
mo
when
it
comes
to
hops
might
mark
the
taste
down
a
bit
but
the
drinkability
up
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
a
drinkable
pale
ale
but
not
my
favorite
and
definitely
the
weakest
offering
i
have
had
from
stone
this
may
be
a
sin
but
i
think
this
one
is
better
at
fridge
temp
than
at
cellar
temp
d
drinkability
is
damm
good
and
tasty
and
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
sweetnspicy
drink
that
is
case
worthy
by
all
means
and
one
i
could
enjoy
all
night
d
not
a
greatmust
have
beer
but
could
be
a
session
beer
depending
on
the
occasion
i
liked
it
not
my
favorite
as
i
tend
more
towards
ipas
but
this
is
a
good
brew
for
friends
who
arent
the
hophead
i
am
i
love
stone
bottles
i
dont
know
if
youll
find
it
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
but
every
so
often
ill
grab
a
sixer
when
im
in
the
mood
recommend
especially
when
grilling
a
bit
sweet
for
a
stand
alone
session
brew
notes
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
nice
one
none
the
less
and
pretty
drinkable
stone
never
lets
me
down
d
another
great
brew
from
stone
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
overall
a
wonderful
beer
one
of
my
favorite
session
ales
that
i
can
find
at
most
of
my
local
liquor
stores
also
a
great
introductory
craft

the

it
smelled
like
a
good

its

was
a
nice
smooth
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
mild

hops
it
was
watery

a

overall
well
crafted
pale
ale
great
balance
of
toasted
maltiness
and
fresh
hoppiness
i
initially
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
little
on
the
hoppybitter
side
stone
beers
tend
to
be
hop
bombs
but
alas
this
pale
ale
is
quite
remarkably
balanced
smell
is
of
malts
and
light
hoppyness
slight
citrus
taste
is
hoppy
with
again
a
light
pineycitrus
taste
bubbles
are
present
but
not
obnoxious
well
balanced
and
great
finish
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
was
shocked
that
i
had
never
reviewed
it
d
a
good
sessionable
pale
nothing
too
fancy
going
on
here
just
a
solid
brew
very
strong
flavors
and
mouthfeel
full
and
tasty
lots
of
drinkability
in
this
one
pours
a
light
cinnamon
brown
with
an
amazing
3
finger
light
tan
head
smells
like
like
sweet
dough
and
floral
hops
taste
is
a
shock
for
such
a
small
beer
first
tastes
like
peaches
in
a
caramel
glaze
with
brown
sugar
mixed
in
follows
with
nice
hops
and
a
grainy
finish
very
impressive
mouthfeel
is
oh
so
smoth
with
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
carbination
drinkability
is
a
very
good
definately
would
drink
a
six
of
this
with
no
problem
stone
does
it
again
brilliant
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
nice
sticky
lacing
forms
rings
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
slowly
dwindles
surprisingly
unhoppy
for
a
stone
beer
both
in
nose
and
flavor
malt
is
toasty
caramely
and
well
balanced
against
the
citrus
hops
unexpected
but
welcome
restraint
extremely
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
low
alcohol
smooth
mouthfeel
and
balance
definitely
drinkable
and
would
recommend
my
favorite
apa
my
standby
fall
back
ale
great
balanced
copper
colored
pale
ale
this
brew
pours
great
with
good
head
retention
very
drinkable
with
sweet
caramel
malts
followed
up
with
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
and
a
semidry
clean
finish
just
a
great
standard
that
i
use
to
measure
other
apas
and
always
seem
to
grab
for
a
stone
pale
ale
over
most
of
the
other
some
times
bigger
more
flavorful
beers
in
the
fridge
great
bluecollar
kinda
beer
a
pretty
complex
but
untamed
hop
profile
makes
for
an
interesting
decidedly
westcoast
pale
ale
recommended
this
could
easily
be
my
regular
drinking
beer
there
is
nothing
extreme
or
special
about
this
but
it
is
full
flavored
and
complex
the
stone
pale
ale
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
foam
head
and
some
occasional
lacing
the
aromas
was
a
malty
caramel
which
was
mmm
good
the
taste
was
balanced
between
the
piney
hoppiness
and
the
malt
finish
in
the
mouth
there
was
a
good
bitterness
that
stayed
on
the
tongue
for
a
good
while
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
weak
carb
sweet
with
some
citrus
character
weak
hop
flavor
caramel
is
present
thin
in
body
too
not
really
impressed
with
this
one
cant
recommend
it
just
an
average
session
ale
pretty
good
for
stone
not
one
of
their
best
though
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
or
what
because
it
was
a
single
bottle
purchase
in
a
mixed
6pack
in
a
store
but
this
just
isnt
good
it
doesnt
taste
bad
necessarily
but
just
very
bland
boring
and
oddly
balanced
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
unless
someone
else
buys
it
because
i
dont
want
to
make
the
same
mistake
twice
if
its
not
just
the
bottle
a
disappointment
from
stone
overall
345
reviews
as
of
this
tasting
i
will
say
that
apas
are
not
a
style
i
buy
often
and
this
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
at
a
party
last
week
i
expected
a
hoppier
than
anything
beer
based
on
other
stone
offerings
but
to
my
surprise
this
was
a
wonderfully
balanced
nice
modest
hopped
beautiful
looking
beer
murky
deep
amber
color
with
medium
offwhite
semilasting
head
smell
is
fairly
mild
lightly
hopped
and
more
heavily
scented
from
the
caramel
sweetness
than
anything
definitely
a
sweeter
pale
with
light
almost
blandish
hop
notes
and
a
slight
burnt
caramel
bittersweetness
somewhat
rich
for
a
pale
and
reminded
me
much
more
of
an
esb
than
any
pale
ive
had
before
could
have
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
for
it
decent
beer
malty

with

clear

with

minimal

diacetylbutterscotch
and
caramel
notes
and
a
mellow
bitterness
effervescent
palate
semicreamy
mothfeel
with
a
nicely
lingering
finish
and
aftertaste
this
pale
ale
poured
a
light
copper
hue
with
just
the
slightest
trace
of
haze
and
a
very
thin
head
that
is
gone
after
one
sip
smells
of
hop
resin
and
pale
malt
taste
is
awesome
balanced
crisp
simple
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
want
to
drink
with
lunch
or
with
dinner
in
front
of
the
tv
session
beer
with
good
flavor
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
look
for
complex
flavors
although
they
might
be
there
carbonation
is
right
on
really
a
shame
about
the
lack
of
head
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
good
intro
into
the
pale
ale
style
nice
coppercolored
beer
with
a
moderate
white
head
pleasing
malty
aroma
with
a
sweet
sort
of
quality
to
go
along
with
the
hopped
scent
very
good
taste
nice
balance
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
i
detect
a
slight
fruity
presence
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
a
lot
of
times
with
pale
ales
or
ipas
theres
one
overpowering
flavor
usually
pine
tree
or
hops
but
this
beer
has
an
excellence
proportion
of
flavors
very
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
looking
amberred
color
slightly
cloudy
nice
head
cream
colored
long
lasting
good
aroma
seems
to
startr
out
with
some
piney
hops
then
smooth
out
with
malt
nice
balanced
beer
tastewise
also
decent
hop
bite
but
also
very
smooth
what
a
nice
lingering
flavor
this
definitely
may
be
the
perfect
session
beer
once
again
not
let
down
by
stone
at
all
it
amazes
me
that
even
stones
standard
fare
is
so
good
they
deserve
the
reputation
theyve
garnered
for
themselves
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
at
5
4
it
is
relatively
sessionable
i
could
drink
a
couple
bombers
in
a
night
if
i
wasnt
driving
this
is
another
winner
from
stone
darker
gold
color
nice
frothy
head
smells
of
malts
and
hops
but
with
a
stinging
alcohol
undertone
tastes
heavenly
the
malts
and
hops
are
well
balanced
and
unlike
other
pale
ales
this
one
seems
to
focus
more
on
the
maltshops
rather
than
additional
flavors
there
are
some
dark
fruits
and
herbal
hints
but
a
nice
lacing
the
whole
glass
through
taste
was
a
fascinating
balance
of
floralfruity
hops
why
drink
this
when
i
could
have
an
ipa
perhaps
its
just
me
though
a
decent
beer
slightly
bready
undertones
and
a
clean
tartslightly
acidic

good
balance
as
well
as

545this
is
one
of
the
ultimate
session
beers
in
my
opinion
on
tap
it
is
especially
smoothe
and
crisp
it
poured
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
not
much
head
because
the
bartender
filled
up
the
pint
to
the
brim
right
off
the
bat
i
could
smell
the
scent
of
floral
hops
and
a
slight
spice
that
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
was
very
good
and
reminded
me
a
bit
of
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
with
a
much
more
balanced
floral
hop
character
and
a
nice
malt
flavor
as
well
seeing
as
how
most
good
bars
around
town
have
this
on
tap

demonic
many
ipas
wish
they
were
this
hoppy
and
this
good
im
about
ready
to
give
up
all
beers
other
than
those
from
my
fab
five
breweries
and
each
beer
from
stone
puts
me
a
step
closer
to
that
day
aaronhaug

i
expected
all
stone
brewing
ales
to
be
totally
dominating
and
ruthless
this
on
the
other
hand
was
beautiful
and
poetic
say
sierra
nevadas
pale
nicely
done
please
atlagerheadsapr
01
it
seems
a
bit
odd
ive
not
had
one
of
these
fine
pale
ales
in
almost
seven
moths
somewhat
hazed
copper
color
with
a
thinnish
but
surprisingly
persistant
head
leaves
a
great
lace
down
the
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
and
citric
with
a
caramel
sweetness
underlying
malt
sweetness
hits
you
up
front
in
the
mouth
as
well
and
is
noticeable
throughout
the
beer
contributing
a
nice
nutty
flavor
the
dominate
taste
however
is
still
the
slightly
acidic
citric
flavors
of
the
hops
they
also
give
the
beer
a
pleasant
oily
smoothness
the
beer
feels
mediumbodied
finishes
dry
and
leaves
you
with
a
nice
fruitysweet
aftertaste
with
lingering
hints
of
hop
bitterness
this
is
probably
more
hoppy
than
the
average
pale
ale
but
this
isnt
an
ipa
or
ruination
theres
a
good
deal
going
on
here
besides
the
hops
and
this
is
a
good
thing
extremely
drinkable
and
pleasant
its
copper
with
a
big
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
noticeably
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
especially
compared
to
other
west
coast
apas
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
with
the
hops
beating
out
the
malt
by
a
length
or
two
im
starting
to
think
that
its
tough
to
make
an
apa
that
really
stands
apart
from
the
pack
this
one
is
better
than
most
but
its
not
a
knockout
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
after
trying
some
of
stones
bigger
beers
like
ruination
double
bastard
and
the
russian
imperial
stout
this
one
seems
tame
by
comparison
i
found
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
to
be
rather
subdued
more
malt
character
than
the
typical
apa
but
still
not
a
bad
brew
a
good
intro
to
the
stone
line
one
of
if
not
the
best
pale
out
there
yum
a
big
thanks
to
murph
for
sending
this
my
way
slightly
hazy
very
deep
reddish
ambercopper
in
color
with
a
creamy
bonewhite
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
limited
but
offers
some
light
fruit
berries
citrus
and
a
mild
caramel
note
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
and
gentle
carbonation
that
leaves
it
surprisingly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
lightly
sweet
and
fruity
reveals
some
biscuity
caramel
malt
and
bright
citrusy
hops
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
sweet
fruity
citrus
maltiness
well
balanced
the
bitterness
is
appropriate
for
the
style
but
notoverdone
and
the
maltiness
tight
carbonation
are
exquisite
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
i
was
expecting
something
more
full
throttle
from
stones
but
then
it
occured
to
me
of
course
they
have
a
more
straightforward
beer
its
their
flagship
and
they
do
make
the
smoked
porter
as
well
and
i
actually
loved
it
because
it
wasnt
abusively
hoppy
if
it
was
what
would
be
the
point
of
having
all
of
their
other
more
aggressive
beers
this
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
from
stone
wellrounded
fruity
and
highly
drinkable
pours
lighter
than
the
levitation
and
not
the
big
hop
aroma
right
off
the
bat
fair
head
that
fades
quickly
but
laces
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
malt
hop
mix
at
the
end
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
more
hops
would
have
made
it
a
little
more
thirst
quenching
again
a
nice
offering
from
stone
the
fourth
stone
beer
i
have
reviewed
the
4
empty
bomber
bottles
now
take
pride
of
place
in
my
kitchen
this
is

apparently

i
cant
think
why
beautiful
offwhite
head
that
stays
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lace
when
it
does
go
down
orangecopper
color
fruity
and
citrus
aromas
take
charge
of
the
nose
specifically
a
tangerinelike
aroma
with
a
taste
comes
more
fruity
hop
bitterness
that
is
just
a
notch
above
the
biscuitlike
malt
flavors
that
accompany
it
fruity
in
the
front
and
bitter
in
the
back
leaves
the
characteristic
rindlike
bitterness
on
the
edges
of
your
tongue
definitely
aimed
at
the
hophead
but
still
wellbalanced
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
great
tasting
beer
full
of
smooth
flavor
one
would
expect
from
a
solid
pale
ale
very
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
maybe
a
little
more
hop
but
who
cares
if
this
were
a
massmarketed
beer
it
would
be
a
top
five
seller
soft
spicyhusky
hop
aroma
orangish
with
a
soft
creamy

nice
mellow
creamy
mouthfeel
some
nice

very
drinkable
thirst
quenching
sweet
maltiness
one
of
if
not
the
best
tasting
pale
ales
ive
had
my
first
stone
experience
is
a
grand
one
a
nice
amber
with
orange
highlights
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
very
nice
herbal
and
grapefruit
tones
in
the
aroma
really
nice
maltiness
in
this
pale
ale
a
caramel
maltiness
i
think
a
good
bitterness
too
i
usually
prefer
highly
hopped
pale
ales
but
this
doesnt
seem
overly
hopped
and
i
love
it
this
is
probably
the
best
balanced
pale
ale
ive
had
excellent
notes
a
richly
hopped
brew
that
takes
pride
in
the
west
coast
style
definite
good
drinking
here
for
a
seasoned
hop
head
might
be
a
bit
too
much
for
someone
that
wants
a
balanced
pale
ale
i
thought
id
give
this
a
try
snce
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
brewerys
products
on
the
second
sip
the
taste
was
empty
almost
watery
i
think
i
might
have
a
bad
batch
although
there
was
decent
head
retention
and
lace
on
my
glass
i
might
take
it
back
and
exchange
it
the
good
sip
featured
a
nice
hoppy
tang
though
it
did
taste
similar
to
other
west
oast
ales
all
in
all
nothing
special
and
a
bit
of
a
letdown
still
excellent
but
lacking
that
hop
pop
i
rated
this
as
the
earlier
tasting
of
this
beer
my
advice
look
for
this
early
next
year
and
drink
it
fast
fresh
and
taste
pours
from
the
tap
at
mcnellies
okc
a
dark
copper
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
it
dissipates
fairly
soon
leaving
moderate
lacing
as
several
others
have
said
there
is
very
little
aroma
maybe
theres
a
hint
of
bread
but
its
probably
more
in
my
mind
than
my
nose
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouth
is
nice
and
creamy
maybe
theres
something
wrong
with
the
tap
because
this
tastes
more
like
a
hoppy
brown
than
a
pale
ale
its
not
bad
but
rather
unremarkable
overall
my
top
two
in
fresh
hop
beers
i
still
think
founders
harvest
edges
this
on
out
in
flavor
and
aroma

a
small
margin

this
one
is
definitely

off

coming
from
a
bottle
titled

this
did
not
smack

to
be

is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
like
how
the
hops
are
not
overly
juicy
but
not
overly
bitter
or
harsh
either
the

darker

i
expected
with
almost
no

the
taste
is
predominated
by
caramel
malt
flavors
with
some
floral
and
bitter
notes
contributed
by
the
hops
not
bad
but
i
wouldve
liked
to
see
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
be
a
bit
more
delicate
to
let
the
fresh
hops
shine
through
not
the
easiest
6ish
pale
to
throw
back
but
if
youre
craving
dank
hops
with
a
lighter
maltbackbone
this
might
hit
the
spot
overall
one
of
the
better
fresh
hop
ipas
ive
sampled
to
date
and
at
a
great
price
point
its
likely
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
soon
overall
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
interesting
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
the
body
is
medium
with
some
heft
and
depth
to
it
revealing
a
couple
layers
on
the
tongue
as
it
rolls
smoothly
over
almost
silky
without
giving
up
a
strong
crispness
all
the
way
from
beginning
to
end
overall
i
cant
say
this
is
the
best
wet
hop
ale
ive
had
but
its
a
very
good
one
and
much
easier
to
obtain
than
some
of
my
favorites
as
such
i
will
slot
this
into
the
list
of
seasonal
beers
i
must
procure
when
they
come
out
each
year
overall
its
alright
but
i
cant
say
its
above
85
overall
maybe
the
date
has
something
to
do
with
it

but
one
that
could
use
maybe
just
a
little
more
hop
bite
othis
isnt
a
bad
ale
but
when
compared
to
other
fresh
hops
ales
it
comes
up
a
little
short
best
by
date
of
30
december
makes
me
think
this
bottle
is
just
past
its
prime
will
have
to
try
it
again
next
year
o
it
is
definitely
a
big
fresh
hop

those
dusty
dank

brew
i
bought
this
about
a
week
from
the

which
was
dec
30
so
freshness
was

im
sure
fresh
this
would
be
a
good

not

then
followed

a
sound
beer
that
is
well

those
that
desire
a

hoppy
brew
the
pours
a
creamy
and
frothy
head
that
dissipates
quickly

still
leaves
some
foam
around
the
edges
and
clings
to
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
reddish
tinge
the
beer
has
a
stronger
malt
smell
than
expected
but
the
hop
smell
is
not
too
diminished
the
hops
have
a
wet
grassy
smell
to
them
and
slight
notes
of
pine
resin
as
well
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
a
much
maltier
presence
the
hops
are
much
more
bitter
and
a
wet
grassy
taste
than
the
smell
but
still
have
slight
notes
of
pine
the
malt
is
stronger
than
the
smell
and
only
slightly
offset
the
hops
with
a
sweet
malt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
on
the
heavy
side
with
biting

the
feel
is
smooth
bordering
on
velvety
an
dis
quite
refreshing
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
with
wet
hops
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
each
year
o
a
good
beer
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
just
a
little
more
hop
tones
especially
in
the
taste
than
what
i
got
lightly
carbonated
good
color
that
is
an
amber
golden
smell
is
a
very
pleasant
hoppy
odor
that
teases
the
taste
buds
minimal
floral
hints
a
real
earthy
simple
scent
the
taste
is
equally
simple
and
straight
forward
just
as
i
expected
from
the
name
the
hoppy
bitterness
is
not
compounded
by
further
complexities
a
delightful
beer
that
is
deserving
of
the
name
fresh
hops
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
o
not
terrible
but
theres
something
either
in
the
execution
or
unique
to
this
bottle
that
puts
the
balance
out
of
whack
overall
a
pretty
fresh
tasting
apa
you
get
a
nice
burst
of
hops
but
it
finishes
sort
of
empty
once
the
hops
hit
the
palate
they
are
gone
not
too
long
after
and
there
isnt
much
left
to
it
i
like
brews
with
a
little
more
bite
with
a
solid
aftertaste
its
still
a
solid
brew
from
great
divide
and
i
would
definitely
dig
into
another
bottle
o
an
exceptionally
easydrinking
fresh
hop
ale
however
i
still
prefer
the
much
cheaper
sn
hemispheres
so
will
probably
not
pay
8
for
this
again
when
i
can
get
either
of
those
for
5
plus
you
get
3
ounces
more
with
the
sns
poured
a
orangish
golden
hue
with
one
finger
head
that
left
a
lace
ring
around
the
glass
fresh
floral
grassy
citric
hop
smell
with
touch
of
sweet
caramel
and
biscuits
the
slightly
breadiness
and
sweet
caramel
malt
add
balance
and
fullness
not
quite
chewey
but
definitely
not
thing
to
a
mostly
floralgrassy
citric
hop
beer
that
isnt
sharp
or
biting
but
still
packs
a
punch
this
is
as
close
as
it
seems
one
can
get
to
a
hoppy
ipa
or
even
dipa
without
making
the
hops
so
dominant
that
everything
else
is
just
outside
the
lines
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
beer
well
i
am
so
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
last
years
release
in
fact
i
kept
coming
across
a
similar
very
astringent
grassy
note
in
many
of
their
beers
that
threw
me
off
not
the
case
here
this
is
a
great
wethopped
beer
with
all
the
right
resiny
oily
hoppy
goodness
well
done
great
divide
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
ipaapa
style
o
stupid
beer
i
say
that
because
theres
a
lot
missing
here
aroma
is
good
for
sure
but
the
taste
is
unbalanced
too
much
malt
and
this
diacetyl
problem
keeps
persisting
with
almost
every
great
divide
beer
ive
had
in
recent
times
overallvery
nice
beer
strong
layered
aromas
are
my
favorite
part
i
wouldve
preferred
a
longer
finish
but
i
can
forgive
for
this
solid
beer
oanother
great
fresh
hop
beer
the
fresh
hops
are
showcased
nearly
as
well
in
an
apa
as
oppose
to
an
ipa
but
still
a
yummy
and
very
affordable
beer
beer
is
mediumlight
to
medium
in
body
which
is
surprisingly
thin
for
the
abv
and
style
of
beer
carbonation
is
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
of
foamy
14
smooth
12
and
watery
14
sensations
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
i
like
the
balance
in
great
divide
fresh
hop
as
it
makes
for
a
versatile
beer
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
bill
when
it
comes
to
the
fresh
hop
aiipa
style
though
a
very
good
nicely
balanced
apa
but
not
really
worth
the
price
per
fl
oz
in
bomber
format
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
citrus
and
pine
on
the
nose
subtle
nothing
overpowering
starts
with
a
grassy
earthiness
slightly
bitter
but
without
that
ipa
bite
sweet
malt
comes
in
midpalate
that
balances
the
hop
bitterness
perfectly
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
fresh
hop
pale
well
crafted
and
balanced
another
quality
beer
from
great
divide
o
for
7
99bomber
this
is
a
good
pickup
i
would
buy
another
in
thr
future
i
would
pair
it
with
some
sort
of
roasted
lamb
or
a
cut
of
primerib
and
some
seasonal
veggies
kudos
to
great
divide
for
a
tasty
beer
o
this
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
that
is
superbly
light
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
very
smooth
it
covers
the
palate
and
very
enjoyable
my
only
complaint
about
this
brew
is
i
wish
more
of
the
hop
dank
sweetness
and
pine
notes
would
have
come
through
i
understand
this
brew
is
not
meant
to
be
the
boldest
ipa
great
divide
went
for
balance
and
i
must
say
they
got
very
close
to
perfect
i
just
wish
more
smell
was
present
if
you
served
this
to
me
with
any
other
ipa
this
would
not
stand
out
until
i
tasted
it
however
this
is
a
very
nice
balanced
ipa
probably
the
best
ive
had
in
the
taste
category
and
is
a
variety
break
from
the
darker
heavier
brews
in
the
autumn
season
cheers
overall
this
is
everything
a
wethop
ale
should
be
plus
some
big
bright
hop
character
and
some
an
excellent
malt
backbone
just
damn
tasty
get
it
up
and
get
it
good
o
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
with
lots
of
fresh
grain
and
hop
flower
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
bitter
finish
a
good
fresh
hop
apa
overall
a
very
good
fresh
hopped
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
style
very
grassy
and
juicy
with
a
nice
smooth
medium
body
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
drink
malts
are
raw
and
earthy
and
i
expected
a
bit
more
boldness
from
a
fresh
hop
beer
we
cant
forget
that
this
is
only
a
pale
ale
so
it
competes
well
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
great
lots
of
hopy
oils
and
a
medium
body
gives
this
a
moderate
sticky
thickness
carbonation
is
mild
and
gives
it
a
soft
feel
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
earthy
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
fresh
hop
profile
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
what
i
was
expecting
pours
a
deep
gold
with
thick
white
foam
good
carbonation
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
head
recedes
back
to
an
easy
half
inch
of
thick
foam
lots
of
pine
and
dank
resin
on
the
nose
some
bread
a
touch
of
citrus
and
grass
flavors
follow
the
nose
bready
malt
backbone
just
enough
to
support
the
hops
that
dominate
the
flavor
i
get
thick
resinous
pine
hops
with
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
great
hop
presence
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
dry
yet
oily
and
sticky
from
the
hops
overall
out
of
the
fresh
hopped
beers
this
year
this
is
hands
down
the
best
cheers
one
amazing
beer
definately
will
have
again
o
the
relatively
light
body
showcases
the
hops
wonderfully
they
are
certainly
in
the
foreground
but
by
no
means
overpowering
or
overly
bitter
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
no
complaints
to
be
had
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
later
edit
discussed
this
with
a
couple
of
friends
and
they
are
confirming
that
the
october
batches
are
selling
for
huge
discounts
on
both
keg
and
bottle
dont
let
the
hype
on
fresh
sway
you
the
16bbl
costs
me
40
which
is
a
screaming
deal
on
any
ipa
of
quality
i
hear
the
former
1213
bombers
are
going
for
34
which
again
is
a
heck
of
a
deal
on
a
marvelous
beer
o
wonderful
do
try
it
overall
far
from
the
best
fresh
hop
ales
but
i
believe
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
pale
ale
fresh
hopped
ales
i
ever
drank
pity
it
cost
1013
dollars
fresh
or
i
would
love
to
get
it
again
if
you
see
it
now
discounted
for
as
cheap
as
i
got
it
give
it
a
try
o
a
nice
apa
with
good
bitterness
that
isnt
overly
obtrusive
or
complicated

tap

zero

transcribed
notes
from
11132012
tasting
very
great
and
intense
hop
flavor
and
extremely
hop
forward
flavored
beer
pretty
high
bitterness
really
great
flavor
relatively
light
beer
with
a
lasting
bitter
dry
finish
im
a
fan
and
im
just
getting
to
like
ipas
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
almost
crisp
with
a
medium
body
light
zesty
carbonation
and
a
bitter
finish
which
was
on
the
light
bitter
side
full
of
fresh
piney
and
citrus
hops
with
a
nice
balanced
mix
of
bready
malts
and
juicy
hop
sweetness
a
top
notch
pale
ale
that
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
great
on
its
own
or
paired
with
food
overall
it
was
fantastic
very
easy
to
drink
and
really
smooth
o
probably
one
of
the
best
fresh
hop
ales
ive
had
its
about
two
months
old
so
i
imagine
this
was
orgasmic
when
fresh
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
to
date
overall
this
beer
works
as
a
fine
ipa
a
clean
example
not
complex
in
my
opinion
but
wellmade
nonetheless
until
i
try
some
of
this
brewerys
acclaimed
stouts
a
couple
of
which
im
still
aging
a
bit
this
is
about
my
favorite
beer
of
theirs
to
date
overall
a
good
apa
but
a
little
too
average
even
with
it
being
fresh
hopped
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
here
that
really
sticks
out
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
the
thousands
like
it
out
there
i
had
big
expectations
given
the
experiences
with
great
divide
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
nothing
stood
out
as
far
as
complexity
with
aroma
or
flavor
maybe
i
had
an
off
bottle
overall
this
is
excellent
beer
and
its
amazing
to
see
what
great
divide
can
do
to
a
pale
ale
the
difference
between
this
and
a
standard
offering
in
the
style
is
akin
to
the
difference
between
michelangelo
and
a
talented
high
school
student
the
sheer
variety
and
potency
of
flavors
in
here
is
impressive
made
all
the
more
so
by
the
light
abv
and
the
midrange
ibus
well
worth
trying
o
a
nice
fresh
hop
pale
ale
that
went
well
with
the
spicy
chinese
food
i
was
eating
id
have
this
again
and
im
looking
forward
to
having
it
on
draft
i
enjoyed
this
years
founders
harvest
ale
better
though
pours
clear
copper
with
minimal
head
aroma
slams
with
grassy
piney
hops
taste
follows
with
this
one
highlighting
the
hops
foe
sure
interestingly
there
is
a
massive
malt
backbone
to
this
and
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
grapefruit
and
aromatic
hops
excellent
pale
with
medium
carbonation
and
slick
palate
malty
sweetness
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
up
good
stuff
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
golden
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
spice
and
spicy
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
citrus
citrus
hop
and
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
the
hoppiness
aspect
going
on
here
really
carried
on
throughout
the
entire
glass
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
flavor
was
fairly
well
balanced
and
inviting
if
i
hadnt
been
on
a
ticking
spree
this
day
i
likely
would
have
had
a
full
pint
of
this
one
without
hesitation
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
have
not
done
so
before
pours
clear
golden
with
a
effervescent
white
head
flavor
and
aroma
matched
each
other
quite
well
offering
some
nice
bright
floral
and
grassy
hops
on
top
of
a
sweet
crackery
malt
belly
a
lighter
active
mouthfeel
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
try
would
happily
drink
again
o
one
of
the
better
fresh
hop
beers
out
there
wish
i
could
have
had
this
closer
to
the
bottling
date
but
its
held
up
well
after
more
than
a
month
in
the
bottle
and
a
trip
across
the
country
a
very
solid
beer
right
up
there
in
the
fresh
hop
brews
this
year
o
one
of
the
better
fresh
hop
beers
ive
had
it
really
hits
that
wet
fresh
dank
note
but
its
rounded
out
well
with
a
floral
hop
backing
excellent
brew
would
certainly
like
to
have
it
again
and
again
pours
beautiful
coppergold
with
nice
inch
of
white
foam
nose
is
bold
grassy
funkiness
some
citrus
peel
and
melon
are
detected
as
well
the
flavor
definitely
picks
up
that
dank
grassiness
in
a
big
overwhelming
way
there
is
some
fruitiness
in
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
imo
it
drinks
heavy
for
what
i
would
classify
an
apa
ultimately
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
lacked
nothing
in
terms
of
flavor
but
the
flavor
just
didnt
work
on
my
palate
far
too
one
dimensional
with
a
dank
mulchiness
that
struggled
to
achieve
any
complexity
o
havent
had
this
one
in
a
while
but
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
cant
ask
for
much
more
in
a
pale
ale
except
maybe
that
it
be
sold
in
6packs
rather
than
a
bomber
guess
you
cant
always
get
what
you
want
this
is
one
of
gds
best
beers
overall
a
well
done
tasty
beer
love
the
1
2
punch
of
hops
then
malts
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
good
price
easy
enough
to
find
worth
the
purchase
for
sure
drink
i
will
say
i
am
usually
excited
for
gd
beers
although
besides
the
yeti
lineup
my
fervor
is
waining
for
some
other
beers
in
the
series
may
have
to
try
to
land
things
in
the
12oz
size
before
going
22oz
probably
wont
have
this
one
next
year
this
pale
ale
is
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
a
modest
white
ring
of
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
comes
on
with
skunky
grass
hop
and
deep
grape
wheat
for
a
pale
ale
its
nice
enough
for
sure
the
flavor
is
mellow
toasted
ryewheat
and
soft
lemon
grass
hops
very
crisp
feeling
with
medium
to
near
light
body
frisky
carbonation
for
an
edgey
hop
brew
very
refreshing
and
tasty
o
a
solid
fresh
hop
ale
a
more
floral
hop
profile
then
the
usual
from
gd
i
can
really
feel
the
freshness
in
this
beer
good
stuff
o
overall
an
excellent
wet
hop
ale
i
cant
tell
what
time
of
hops
were
used
but
very
delicious
lots
of
bubbles
run
throuigh
the
body
of
this
orange
colored
brew
a
creamy
inch
thick
head
sits
on
top
and
retains
very
well
the

is
fresh

unmatched
d
as
stated
above
the
beer
seems
smoother
as
you
drink
more
of
it
if
you
combine
that
with
the
fact
that
its
not
very
filling
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
as
long
as
youre
down
with
the
hop
taste
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
at
a
time
since
i
only
have
the
one
22
oz
bottle
but
im
sure
i
could
put
away
a
decent
amount
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
for
beginners
i
find
it
a
bit
stronger
than
other
beers
that
ive
had
of
this
style
hazed
orange
thin
tight
ivroy
white
head
good
retention
and
intricate
lace
properties
great
aroma
of
fresh
hops
orange
marmalade
based
malt
derivatives
and
grassy
pungent
hop
oils
this
all
follows
through
on
the
buds
bright
citric
hop
tones
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
grassy
very
fresh
tasting
even
though
this
is
months
old
malt
provides
a
solid
backbone
and
is
toffeeish
and
caramelly
in
nature
some
of
that
marmalade
character
comes
through
as
well
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
yet
another
nice
accomplishment
by
great
divide
they
have
been
impressing
the
hell
out
of
me
over
the
past
year
or
so
pours
a
hazy
amber
possible
hop
haze
with
a
nice
thick
beige
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
just
jumps
out
at
you
with
huge
juicy
citrus
and
floral
hops
some
sweet
caramel
toasted
bread
fruity
esters
and
a
hint
of
ethanol
the
taste
starts
off
with
an
agressive
hoppiness
citrusy
and
floral
very
fresh
and
green
tasting
followed
by
a
caramel
sweetness
fruity
esters
and
toasted
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
excellent
an
excellent
apa
just
bursting
with
fresh
hop
flavor
and
a
crisp
finish
that
balances
the
beer
well
something
to
seek
out
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
medium
smooth
clean
good
balance
keeps
this
from
being
too
harsh
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
few
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
tatsing
brew
at
times
its
almost
like
having
a
mouthfull
of
fresh
hop
cones
id
been
enthusiastically
seeking
out
this
beer
for
a
while
ever
since
i
heard
it
was
coming
out
i
like
great
divides
stuff
and
im
glad
to
say
it
was
worth
the
effort
to
get
a
bottle
an
impressive
showcase
for
this
years
delicious
pacific
northwest
hop
crop
im
hoping
they
make
this
an
annual
thing
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
off
the
conditioning
tank
i
bet
its
heavenly
met
my
expectations
only
wish
it
was
a
tad
more
drinkable
for
a
pale
ale
could
have
dropped
to
5
or
so
and
still
kicked
ass
recommended
for
fans
of
hoppy
beers
just
dont
go
in
expecting
nectar
of
hop
juice
spritzer
this
is
an
apa
to
treasure
one
of
the
most
drinkable
very
hoppy
beers
ive
ever
had
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
complex
malt
scent
that
is
comprised
of
pale
carapils
and
bisquit
malts
it
has
a
nice
bisquity
aroma
that
balances
well
with
the
hops
the
hop
aroma
is
very
nice
it
has
a
grassy
hop
scent
that
is
bitter
and
rich
but
not
over
the
top
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
well
balanced
attack
of
malt
and
hops
it
has
a
light
crystal
and
bisquit
malt
flavor
along
with
a
bitter
citrus
hop
finish
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
has
tremendous
mouthfeel
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
near
perfect
beer
i
like
everything
about
it
just
another
great
beer
from
great
divide
cheers2beers
drinkability
very
very
easy
drinking
this
bomber
wont
last
long
smooth
fresh
and
delicious
clear
light
orange
brew
nearly
white
one
finger
head
on
the
pour
left
only
a
single
bubble
layer
on
top
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
strong
with
fresh
hops
mostly
citrus
grapefruit
with
some
pine
simple
but
really
pungent
taste
is
strong
with
pine
hops
with
a
little
citrus
and
grassy
hops
in
the
back
not
overly
bitter
though
even
though
there
is
a
hearty
dose
of
hops
fairly
balanced
but
the
hops
are
the
main
focus
here
and
nothing
overly
malty
comes
out
to
me
mouthfeel
is
good
typical
of
a
decent
pale
ale
drinkability
is
really
good
crisp
and
refreshing
and
not
overbearing
with
the
flavor
or
the
alcohol
level
definately
worth
a
shot
tastes
of
fresh
herbal
hops
soem
bitterness
here
but
not
overwhelming
more
fresh
and
floral
than
bitingly
bitter
some
nice
fruity
malt
to
back
it
up
hops
stick
to
the
mouth
but
the
beer
is
fairly
light
otherwise
nice
stuff
drinkability
not
sure
i
could
session
a
six
pack
of
this
because
of
the
sweetness
but
its
damn
well
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
right
up
there
with
alpha
king
borderline
ipa
d
the
drinkability
was
good
not
my
favorite
great
divide
beer
but
a
good
one
none
the
less
put
this
cloudy
sort
of
muddy
looking
beer
bam
right
in
the
kisser
huge
grassy
fresh
hops
greet
the
nose
and
then
beat
on
your
toungue
when
you
take
quaff
big
hops
for
a
pale
ale
the
hop
bitterness
makes
this
a
lip
smacker
and
taste
bud
killa
a
damn
fine
beer
from
a
damn
fine
brewery
the
beer
dispenses
from
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
a
luminous
golden
amber
color
with
a
moderate
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
erodes
leaving
a
fine
coating
of
lace
to
surround
the
glass
nose
has
pleasant
hop
floral
aroma
backed
buy
sweet
malt
start
is
slightly
sweet
the
top
middling
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
mildly
acidic
with
nice
hop
spiciness
dry
aftertaste
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
great
divide
a
long
time
favorite
brewery
fairly
drinkable
the
finish
is
rough
at
first
but
i
was
craving
it
by
the
end
still
this
wasnt
up
to
par
with
the
other
hop
harvest
beers
ive
tried
this
year
founders
sierra
nevada
hats
off
to
great
divide
for
trying
something
fresh
feel
is
about
medium
a
bit
parching
in
its
bitterness
and
dryness
but
stays
the
coursecoarse
and
keeps
a
very
teetering
balance
that
could
fold
either
side
into
too
much
pine
andor
too
much
parchness
that
said
for
no
other
reason
then
this
its
damn
drinkable
it
keeps
a
nice
clean
profile
overall
while
grabbing
hold
with
woody
citrus
tinted
bitterness
and
maintains
a
doughy
little
malt
backing
while
doing
it
some
sweetness
finds
its
way
in
around
the
corners
in
the
middle
and
very
very
late
after
the
finish
which
in
turn
helps
this
become
quite
a
fun
ride
to
drink
down
after
finally
sitting
down
with
this
one
it
seemed
a
bit
more
woody
then
the
others
ive
had
in
the
past
month
or
so
a
little
more
clean
snappy
crisp
and
citric
and
this
bottle
would
have
nailed
it
much
like
previous
bottles
another
bottle
or
two
and
another
review
may
be
in
order
copper
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
ok
head
but
some
great
lacing
on
the
glass
huge
hop
aromavery
fresh
as
the
name
implies
not
as
citrusy
as
some
pale
ales
but
very
fresh
cut
grass
like
nice
big
hop
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
doesnt
have
the
over
hopped
astringency
of
other
us
pales
good
bodynice
clean
finish
considering
how
hoppy
it
is
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
really
well
done
us
pale
ale
great
divide
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
us
brewer
thanks
a
bunch
to
mushroomcloud
for
the
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
2005
great
divide
has
been
a
multiyear
roll
of
brilliantly
brewed
beers
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
reddishorange
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
rocky
and
white
lacing
coats
the
glass
all
over
the
place
the
aroma
is
amazing
it
is
as
if
this
beer
climbed
a
mountain
and
screamed
citrusy
hops
absolutely
breathtaking
this
just
might
be
the
best
smelling
beer
i
have
drank
to
date
the
taste
is
all
that
a
pale
ale
should
be
and
more
but
not
so
much
more
that
it
infringes
on
ipa
territory
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
flavor
but
there
are
also
nots
of
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
mediumthick
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
oh
so
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
by
far
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
if
only
hops
could
be
harvested
year
round
overall
impression
massively
drinkable
enough
balance
to
really
let
me
enjoy
hop
goodness
a
very
well
crafted
beer
i
recommend
it
finally
found
this
in
atlanta
i
really
the
fresh
hop
beers
when
i
can
get
them
the
aroma
was
only
moderately
hoppy
with
distinctive
grass
and
citrus
rocky
offwhite
head
wit
excellent
lacing
that
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
initial
flavor
was
moderately
bitter
with
a
light
sweet
short
finish
carbonation
was
quite
flat
this
was
a
good
but
not
great
beer
as
far
as
fresh
hop
beers
go
this
is
the
best
ive
had
for
a
while
amber
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
and
good
head
retention
not
much
of
a
surprise
with
the
aroma
the
chops
are
huge
with
this
one
loads
of
pine
resin
orange
and
grapefruit
with
some
minor
floral
and
grassy
notes
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
malt
presence
and
a
bit
of
a
peppery
note
but
really
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
with
more
citrus
pine
and
some
green
hop
cone
flavors
its
fairly
heavy
in
the
mouth
too
not
really
all
that
balanced
or
complex
but
if
you
like
hops
this
is
the
beer
for
you
this
is
generally
a
good
beer
i
like
the
aggressive
hoppiness
but
i
just
dont
get
much
out
of
the
taste
the
color
is
copper
with
a
large
offwhite
head
retention
is
very
good
the
aroma
is
solely
of
strong
delicious
citrissy
hop
smell
taste
is
more
of
the
same
very
flavorful
yet
at
the
same
time
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
because
the
flavor
wasnt
much
different
than
standard
dryhopped
apas
freshness
was
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
noticeable
in
the
flavor
bitterness
was
moderate
okay
this
is
a
great
apa
but
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
as
exemplary
as
most
other
reviewers
appearance
copper
amber

with
a
fine

off
white
cream

leaves
wide
bands
of

evenly
down
my
duvel
chalice
as
the
head
floats
above
the
rim
aroma
great
pine
cone
and
citrus
hop
aromatics
also
packs
some
floral
tones
mixed
with
a
sugary
slightly
fruit
malt
base
that
pair
well
with
the
grassiness
of
the
hop
additions
taste
hop
bitterness
very
welcoming
grapefruit
and
grassy
hop
flavors
are
streaking
across
the
palate
semi
sweet
bready
notes
help
balance
finishes
with
a
touch
of
caramelized
citrus
peels
that
reminds
me
of
well
done
orange
chicken
from
a
chinese
restaurant
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
slight
oily
texture
from
the
lucious
loads
of
wet
hops
used
may
be
the
best
pale
ale
ive
tasted
yet
drinkability
22oz
is
effortless
loads
of
flavor
very
refreshing
brew
great
divide
has
found
a
friend
in
the
hop
22
ounce
bottle
great
divide
fresh
hop
ale
pours
out
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
creamy
looking
head
pungent
resiny
hop
aroma
biscuit
malt
flavor
with
lots
of
hop
flavor
not
as
bitter
as
an
ipa
but
this
beer
certainly
has
as
much
hop
flavor
as
almost
any
ipa
grapefruit
hop
flavors
the
malt
is
there
but
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
hop
flavor
soft
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
prefer
the
titan
ipa
i
am
really
enjoying
these
fresh
hopped
brews
popping
up
in
our
area
another
solid
offering
from
great
divide
drinkability
good
i
found
myself
drinking
this
like
it
was
the
last
beer
on
earth
and
had
to
remind
myself
to
slow
up
and
enjoy
it
no
problems
very
fresh
very
crisp
very
well
engineered
normally
i
would
pass
up
a
pale
ale
for
an
ipa
but
this
was
a
rewarding
experience
that
any
hop
enthusiast
would
enjoy
im
gonna
call
this
one
an
i
p
ale
ale
witty
huh
because
this
beer
really
defies
categorization
hoppy
and
citrusy
like
an
i
p
a
but
with
the
rich
finish
of
a
superior
pale
ale
all
the
fresh
wet
hops
they
use
in
this
brew
lend
a
remarkably
fresh
taste
right
out
of
the
bottle
a
bit
spendy
at
almost
7
00
for
a
22ounce
bomber
but
this
babys
worth
it
drinkability
notes

its
hard
to
find
a
flaw
in
this
beer
its
just
really
good
it
has
more
hop
flavor
than
most
ipas
with
less
bitterness
this
is
my
first
wet
hopped
beer
and
if
this
is
any
indication
i
should
search
out
more
immediately
another
gem
from
great
divide
i
need
to
go
buy
a
few
more
of
these
22
ounce
bottle
the
mouth
starts
out
moderate
but
it
seems
to
hit
a
blank
spot
and
thin
out
towards
the
finish
interesting
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
interested
past
one
or
two
more
servings
still
i
dont
mind
it
but
i
would
consider
using
a
different
hop
varietal
to
brew
with
next
september
overall
impression
great
example
of
what
you
can
do
with
fresh
hops
definitely
another
quality
offering
hopefully
this
will
be
an
annual
event
drinkability
i
like
the
fresh
hop
style
i
think
this
is
my
3rd
or
4th
and
they
are
always
delicious
the
way
they
bring
out
the
flavors
of
the
hop
but
not
piling
it
on
like
ipas
not
that
that
is
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
good
example
fresh
hop
pale
ale
reminds
me
a
little
of
the
silver
creek
ipa
i
had
a
couple
weeks
ago
in
that
its
darker
than
the
average
pa
yet
still
quite
hoppy
great
divide
definitely
didnt
skimp
on
the
maltsthis
is
no
hop
bomband
there
are
definitely
some
lowlevel
chocolate
notes
floating
around
underneath
the
fresh
hop
smack
as
cokes
noted
the
hop
flavor
is
huge
but
the
bittering
is
controlled
to
the
point
that
you
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
bombers
in
quick
succession
great
beer
extraordinaily
drinkable
i
must
go
find
some
more
of
these
at
6
a
pop
theyre
quite
a
steal
as
are
most
of
this
brewerys
products
as
a
caveat
this
either
has
some
variation
or
needs
to
drunk
very
fresh
as
the
last
two
bottles
ive
had
were
weaker
hopwise
and
while
still
solid
generallly
disappointing
in
comparison
to
my
initial
euphoria
extremely
drinkable
strong
hop
flavor
up
front
balanced
by
a
good
maltiness
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
think
it
leans
more
toward
an
ipa
this
should
be
an
all
year
treat
thanks
to
coal
train
liquors
for
carrying
it
excellent
offering
from
great
divide
if
you
are
into
hops
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
great
hop
flavor
but
its
also
nicely
balanced
pours
a
solid
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
solid
coating
over
the
brew
leaves
a
touch
of
lace
as
the
head
falls
nose
is
all
about
the
hops
sweet
citrusy
hops
touches
of
caramel
malt
are
there
but
its
mostly
hops
flavor
is
very
hoppy
as
well
sweet
citrusy
as
well
as
a
solid
caramel
malt
backbone
light
bitterness
clings
to
the
finish
but
not
offensive
at
all
along
with
a
very
raw
hop
flavor
similar
to
taking
hops
right
off
the
bine
and
tasting
the
flowers
very
tasty
beer
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
to
moderatehigh
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
beer
as
far
as
an
apa
goes
this
really
is
really
drinkable
flavors
are
really
well
melded
nothing
to
complaing
about
drinkability
is
great
too
bad
this
is
a
seasonal
i
wish
this
would
replace
their
denver
pale
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
the
one
complaint
i
have
with
this
beer
seems
to
lack
carbonation
almost
altogether
other
than
that
the
palate
is
quite
refreshing
in
conclusion
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
bomber
is
not
enough
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
fits
right
in
with
gds
other
brews
wellmade
intensely
deep
and
flavorful
this
is
a
rather
aggressive
apa
but
a
name
only
does
so
much
extremely
drinkable
for
one
bomber
much
more
than
that
and
my
taste
buds
will
be
gone
another
very
welldone
beer
in
the
great
divide
bomber
series
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
very
very
soon
for
sure
oberonoct

vibrant
hop
character
is
really
nice
and
this
beer
is
still
fairly
smooth
without
that
intense
grassy
character
i
have
had
in
other
fresh
hop
beers
gueuzedudeoct

good
but
interesting
a
lot
of
flavor
up
front
going
down
watery
and
not
very
much
there
i
still
like
this
beer
might
be
too
watery
for
most
pale
ale
fans
not
great
but
definitely
not
bad
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
cheers
i
found
a
nice
apa
in
what
can
often
be
a
beer
desert
kansas
great
looking
can
this
beer
had
a
very
crisp
taste
i
was
honestly
shocked
i
didnt
anticipate
a
good
beer
i
did
not
take
this
beer
seriously
because
of
the
can
and
print
but
it
is
a
quality
beer
i
nice
ale
not
overly
hoppy
but
not
bland
either
a
good
balance
great
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
be
grabbing
one
of
these
or
two
more
of
these
during
the
summer
time
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
well
for
a
smooth
pale
ale
this
and
sierra
nevada
pale
ales
are
my
favorites
wish
they
came
in
a
6
pack
though
since
they
are
so
enjoyable
hey
i
love
this
beer
and
i
drink
it
from
a
glass
very
simple
description
big
assertive
hop
attack
mellows
out
quickly
and
has
an
authentic
maltiness
thats
really
yummy
its
got
some
nice
malts
giving
it
a
orange
color
and
great
flavor
theres
room
for
a
little
more
complexity
to
this
beer
maybe
more
nose
but
is
it
needed
this
would
be
my
everyday
drinker
if
i
could
buy
it
out
here
in

very
drinkable
great
can

but
what
was
inside
just
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
way
to
malty
in
my
opinion
s
citrus
floral

and
grass
t

maltiness
grass
light
citrus
bready
f

light

and
light
pine
aftertaste
overall
a
good
one
fairly
aggressive
for
a
pale
ale
but
thats
not
uncommon
anymore
so
there
you
have
it
t
bread
malt
forward
bright
citric
lime
peel
and
grass
very
clean
tasting
bitterness
slightly
piercing
but
mild
and
mute
doesnt
get
in
way
of
other
tropical
notespapayawhich
is
also
understated
lots
of
grass
and
hay
but
when
in
kansas
use
whats
around
pours
a
cloudy
gold
from
the
can
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
smells
of
malt
and
citrus
the
taste
combines
biscuits
citrus
and
pine
and
had
a
little
more
hoppy
bitterness
than
i
would
have
expected
medium
mouth
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
it
lingers
on
the
tongue
im
really
enjoying
this
and
its
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
tallgrass
well
done
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
pour
a
pint
and
enjoy
the
hoppy
bitterness
to
the
end
o
a
pretty
good
beer
but
way
to
minerally
bitter
maybe
just
a
less
than
optimal
match
for
the
lightmedium
crystal
malt
contribution
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
like
a
more
mellow
hops
presence
and
a
more
rounded
maltiness
in
my
apas
poured
from
a
pint
can
with
a
drink
by
date

a

tulip
pours
a
semi
hazy
golden
yellowish
orange
with
one
finger
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
spotty
lacing
left
behind
as
i
sip
smells
a
bit
like
a
wit
style
beer
with
some
spicy
herbal
hop
notes
the
taste
falls
a
little
flat
for
my
preferences
leaning
more
towards
a
strong
malt
backbone
and
not
enough
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
right
to
style
for
this
pale
nice
clean
finish
with
a
slight
hop
bite
i
wouldve
rated
this
one
higher
but
the
store
owner
informed
me
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
hoppy
pale
ale
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
feels
a
little
subdued
but
it
took
some
warmth
for
this
to
show
its
potential
light
and
pleasant
to
drink
good
hop
flavor
good
malt
flavor
its
hard
to
remember
nowadays
that
american
pale
ales
probably
should
taste
like
this
this
beer
is
a
very
easy
drinking
well
balanced
brew
a
hint
of
sweetness
is
very
well
balanced
out
a
touch
on
the
cloudy
side
but
overall
good
coloring
pleasent
yet
not
overwelming
smell
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
me
want
another
one
right
away
a
great
sitting
by
the
pool
beer
fruity
yes
so
galaxy
hops
on
display
but
too
sticky
and
sweet
on
top
of
it
drinks
a
lot
heavier
than
5
2
on
tap
at
bernies
in
waukesha
wi
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
mild
with
wheat
citrus
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
smooth
mellow
and
delicious
this
makes
for
quite
a
mean
tasting
pale
ale
another
must
try
smooth
beer
from
tallgrass
o
this
is
a
nice
to
sip
pale
ale
rich
golden
colored
massive
tightly
knit
off
white
head
thats
easily
an
inch
thick
brussels
lacing
great
clarity
aroma
of
vegetal
galaxy
hops
the
flavor
is
fairly
bitter
and
prominently
features
the
vegetal
galaxy
hops
the
fade
is
light
malt
with
a
hint
of
galaxy
hops
the
mouth
is
dry
and
somewhat
chalky
a
wee
bit
on
the
malty
side
but
an
easydrinking
and
tasty
pale
ale
from
tallgrass
i
love
the
artwork
on
the
can
who
knows
what
8bit
has
to
do
with
this
beer
underpowered
it
isnt
but
its
certainly
memorable
ill
definitely
buy
again
enjoy
overall
a
good
pale
ale
that
has
the
bitterness
of
an
ipa
if
i
could
change
anything
i
would
up
the
aroma
and
decrease
the
upfront
bitterness
in
the
flavor
just
a
bit
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
especially
at
the
price
point
anyhow
8bits
got
that
classic
orangish
cloudy
look
which
is
classic
ipa
its
hoppy
but
not
over
the
top
its
full
flavored
and
intense
and
again
without
being
over
bearing
i
really
really
love
this
beer
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
persists
forever
before
leaving
tons
of
sticky
lace
tropical
fruit
and
pine
resin
mixed
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
make
up
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
bread
and
a
hint
of
caramel
with
bits
of
resin
and
grapefruit
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
resinous
mouthfeel
decent
pale
ale
i
could
drink
this
8bit
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
large
frothy
lacing
head
there
is
a
nice
mellow
hop
aroma
with
some
sweet
notes
the
taste
has
a
nice
full
hoppyfloral
taste
and
finishes
with
a
sweet
flavor
rather
balanced
good
full
flavors
nice
carbonation
overall
its
a
very
full
yet
balanced
pale
ale
overall
real
fun
hints
at
some
slight
large
qualities
but
is
a
playful
easy
drinker
i
like
the
biscuity
angle
on
this
with
some
faint
hinting
hop
forward
quality
o
you
better
believe
im
picking
up
a
pack
of
these
on
my
next
run
outstanding
member
of
the
pale
ale
family
even
better
than
some
of
the
top
dogs
like
sierra
nevada
and
boulevard
highly
recommended
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
my
first
experience
with
tallgrass
ill
have
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
of
their
cans
overall
drinkability
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
more
tallgrass
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
pale
ale
its
not
bad
by
a
long
shot
but
it
does
seem
one
dimensional
and
lacks
any
wow
factor
its
a
nice
light
ale
thatd
be
nice
in
the
summer
though
o
overall
this
is
a
good
balanced
coiffing
session
beer
o
you
can
call
it
a
hoppy
pale
ale
but
everythings
balanced
enough
that
even
someone
whos
not
into
hops
can
appreciate
it
overall
another
really
solid
brew
from
tallgrass
ethos
is
better
but
this
is
a
real
solid
american
pale
ale
that
id
drink
again
16oz
can
hazed
copper
with
a
fluffy
and
slightly
offwhite
colored
head
thick
sticky
lacing
down
the
sides
smells
floral
and
citric
with
some
underlying
herbal
notes
sweet
grains
along
the
back
taste
is
similar
with
a
crisp
and
refreshing
hop
bite
that
spreads
herbal
flavors
and
pine
out
an
underlying
grainy
sweetness
help
keep
the
hops
honest
earthy
bitterness
sticks
to
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
creamy
on
the
palate
with
some
light
crispness
that
tingles
the
tongue
this
was
a
nice
apa
with
lots
of
fresh
hop
flavors
wrapped
up
in
a
quite
drinkable
package
love
the
can
graphic
as
well
i
would
like
to
rerate
this
because
i
believe
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
considering
the
good
flavors
before
the
fatal
flaw
seek
this
out
i
only
wish
it
came
in
bottles
so
i
could
save
the
label
it
has
a
nicely
understated
aroma
thats
citrusy
with
a
light
spice
by
itself
the
aroma
isnt
much
but
the
flavor
is
just
fantasticits
light
crisp
and
hoppy
with
a
lemony
lime
zest
and
a
touch
of
pineapple
with
a
hint
of
resin
backed
by
a
gentle
malt
that
keeps
the
hops
in
check
finishes
clean
and
clear
its
good
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
tasting
beers
ive
had
definitely
worth
the
try
pick
it
up
if
you
can
overall
i
loved
this
great
example
of
a
very
bright
and
hoppy
apa
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
have
never
seen
this
side
of
galaxy
hops
before
much
less
palate
attacking
and
drying
then
i
remember
previously
well
done
with
this
one
tallgrass
o
satisfying
enjoyable
not
mindbending
but
very
well
done
considering
the
abv
would
have
it
again
for
sure
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
citrus
a
good
introduction
to
hoppy
style
of
beers
overall
outstanding
aroma
and
powerful
taste
lacking
slightly
in
appearance
but
truly
memorable
artwork
atari
would
be
proud
no
matter
how
sleek
the
newer
ones
may
look
therell
always
be
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
the
old
8bit
games
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amberbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
orange
peel
light
flowers
and
a
twinge
of
flaky
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
brighter
veins
of
grass
and
orange
peel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
nothing
earthshattering
but
definitely
something
im
happy
to
have
available
around
here
now
3rd
can
of
the
four
pack
i
drank
the
first
2
straight
from

to
formally
review
this
one
it
has
a

color
frothy

excellent
head
retention
aromas
are
grass
grapefruit

pine
nice
balanced
complexity
body
is

creamy
but
resiny
bitterness
lingers
some
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
out
of
the
can
or
from
a
glass
its
a
solid
apa
either
way
you
drink
it
tallgrass
8bit
pale
ale
45
overall
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
that
offers
a
bigger
malt
presence
then
most
of
the
pale
ale
out
there
today
extra
points
for
a
sweet
can
im
beginning
an
escapade
back
into
brews
in
cans
that
is
becoming
the
rage
with
brewing
companies
recently
some
despite
my
optimism
with
beer
are
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
this
on
the
other
hand
was
astonishing
for
being
an
pa
from
a
can
smooth
refreshing
and
an
aromatic
head
with
thin
lace
being
that
i
tried
this
on
a
whim
from
a
local
bar
my
doubts
about
the
up
and
coming
microcan
race
have
been
subsided
for
the
time
being
due
to
this
beer
mad
props
to
this
pa
and
all
other
brews
to
come
from
tallgrass
this
is
an
experience
im
a
malthead
so
this
is
high
praise
from
me
pours
to
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
stays
thick
and
leaves
ample
but
erratic
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
fruity
hops
and
toasty
munich
malt
flavor
gets
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
with
a
complex
blend
of
malts
and
tangy
hops
playing
well
together
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
canned
apas
you
could
hope
to
get
your
hands
on
o
a
nice
canned
pale
ale
with
galaxy
hops
that
i
enjoy
point
brewery
wi
just
came
out
with
their
beyond
the
pale
ipa
and
i
dont
even
know
if
i
could
distinguish
these
2
apart
in
a
blind
taste
test
if
you
get
point
try
it
out
o
1up
for
tallgrass
from
8bits
awesome
retro
design
to
its
hopforward
aroma
and
flavor
this
brew
is
nicely
balanced
for
an
easy
drinking
pale
that
packs
a
punch
of
flavor
a
basic
pale
ale
with
a
light
body
average
hoppiness
and
nice
carbonation
the
8bit
has
a
decent
malt
character
to
it
but
beyond
that
a
pretty
limited
flavor
profile
the
hops
here
are
pretty
subdued
a
little
citrusy
but
generally
came
across
as
pretty
flat
to
me
with
little
immediate
bite
or
depth
of
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
an
average
american
style
pale
ale
with
a
can
thats
more
intriguing
than
the
contents
o
im
glad
i
dont
have
to
drink
this
as
my
local
apa

the

not

quite

bit
definitely
one
of
the
top
tallgrass
brews
and
one
i
will
definitely
drink
again
in
the
future
i
do
like
the
artwork
though
but
other
than
that
i
just
cant
get
into
this
one
well
this
is
certainly
a
good
pale
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
up
there
i
love
that
it
is
in
cans
i
beleive
it

keep

of
grass
overall
great
appearance
blend
good
body
and
aroma
the
beer
pours
from
the
tap
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
modest
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
floral
and
citrus
hops
there
is
a
distinct
character
here
which
may
be
due
to
the
heavy
dose
of
galaxy
hops
i
dont
quite
know
how
to
describe
it
other
than
bitter
fruit
more
melon
than
orchard
fruit
this
character
continues
onto
the
palate
a
slight
caramel
aspect
provides
some
balance
but
again
the
unique
hops
character
dominates
i
dont
know
if
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
that
tastes
quite
like
this
a
pleasant
offering
from
the
folks
at
tallgrass
o
could
have
something
nice
here
add
more
hops
one
of
the
few
microbrews
i
have
had
in
a
can
first
in
a
long
time
to
be
honest
it
was
the
artwork
of
the
can
that
made
me
buy
this
beer
reminded
me
of
my
childhood
playing
8
bit
video
games
smell
is
appearance
are
great
has
a
nice
hop
fragrance
and
a
decent
golden
color
however
the
taste
is
very
metallic
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
this
beer
is
a
let
down
to
be
honest
it
has
a
very
solid
aroma
and
it
looks
appetizing
but
it
certainly
falls
short
cheers
d
good
not
great
too
much
hop
bitterness
distracts
from
some
of
the
pleasant
hop
flavor
plenty
of
malt
also
distracts
in
a
way
that
i
find
unpleasant
stylistically
to
me
this
drinks
more
like
an
english
bitter
than
an
apa
o
a
solid
pale
ale
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
often
if
i
could
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
some
earthy
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
o
an
excellent
apa
for
sure
very
balanced
and
drinkable
hoppiness
is
a
nice
addition
and
bitterness
isnt
weak
either
just
mild
enough
to
be
an
apa
tasty
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
great
drinkability
is
superb
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlevel
carbonation
creating
a
crisp
and
modestly
soft
mouthfeel
closes
dryly
as
one
would
expect
with
the
substantial
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
easy
drinking
pale
with
some
great
hops
did
i
mention
the
kick
ass
can
ya
i
am
a
total
geek
o
very
nice
hop
forward
beer
malt
strikes
a
touch
of
balance
but
showcases
hops
very
well
beautiful
looking
beer
as
well
a
very
solid
beer
wonderful
hop
aroma
nice
malty
sweetness
tone
down
the
ibus
from
40
to
maybe
30
and
its
a
more
balance
and
soft
pale
ale
that
you
could
tear
through
all
evening
im
liking
it
but
this
is
totally
a
one
beer
an
evening
drink
for
me
8bit
is
a
genuine
and
gracefull
pale
ale
that
is
characterful
enough
to
appease
the
most
demanding
hop
heads
but
also
smooth
enough
to
capture
the
taste
buds
of
novices
alike
id
be
happy
to
keep
a
six
pack
of
these
in
my
stable
anytime
i
seem
to
be
a
fan
of
galaxy
hops
and
8bit
has
become
a
fridge
favorite
over
the
summer
a
pale
ale
with
big
hops
and
flavor
neither
of
which
are
subtle
so
these
tallboys
are
great
to
feed
that
pesky
hop
demon
that
often
growls
for
more
final
thoughts
given
how
robust
it
is
ill
have
to
give
this
one
a
thumbs
up
on
sale
at
7
99
a
four
pack
of
16
ounce
cans
its
a
good
deal
if
they
focus
in
the
hop
character
a
little
more
and
balance
the
flavors
itll
be
a
real
winner
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
this
has
the
profile
of
daisy
cutter
but
lacks
the
quality
i
was
excited
to
try
it
glad
i
did
but
will
be
unlikely
to
purchase
again
o
while
it
might
not
be
among
the
top
tier
pales
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
tallgrass
love
the
16oz
can
which
is
great
for
outdoor
activities
this
is
a
really
nice
and
smooth
pale
ale
and
the
citrus
hops
really
kick
in
as
the
beer
warms
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
now
by
far
one
my
favorite
pale
ales
plus
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
tall
boy
cans
is
a
huge
bonus
props
to
tallgrass
they
continue
to
wow
me
with
their
beers
taste
is
big
on
both
flavoring
and
bittering
hops
with
a
light
malt
base
the
flavor
profile
definitely
showcases
the
galaxy
hop
but
maybe
is
a
tad
onedimensional
the
more
i
drink
these
smash
or
single
hop
beers
the
more
i
appreciate
a
solid
well
conceived
hop
schedule
or
maybe
im
just
not
a
huge
galaxy
fan
either
way
i
find
this
beer
to
be
just
average
tasting
cheers
o
this
beer
seems
quite
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
and
is
packed
with
interesting
hop
flavors
it
is
very
enjoyable
overall
i
want
to
thank
timmyj21
for
this
extra
smell
is
not
my
thing
but
after
finishing
this
16oz
can
i
am
kind
of
a
believer
on
this
one
pick
it
up
if
you
get
the
chance
good
solid
drinker
will
go
well
with
my
lunch
of
very
fine
ground
beer
grilled
to
perfection
and
corn
on
the
cob
mmmmm
o
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
great
sessionable
beer
and
one
that
i
would
get
again
and
recommend
to
others
to
give
a
try
refreshing
and
very
nice
summer
beer
notes
solid
pale
ale
not
quite
in
the
top
echelon
but
it
is
a
very
good
one
i
really
like
galaxy
hops
and
they
were
definitely
present
here
although
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
with
how
much
floralherbal
hop
flavor
was
also
present
overall
it
is
a
winner
although
not
quite
on
the
level
of
the
amazing
usually
limited
distribution
pale
ales
grab
some
for
the
summer
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
ive
been
buying
it
regularly
it
really
works
out
well
for
the
hot
summer
days
when
you
dont
want
some
thing
thats
too
heavy
a
tasty
thirst
quenching
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
its
the
strong
suit
of
this
beer
some
more
hops
with
this
feel
would
make
this
a
really
nice
pale
as
is
its
really
quaffable
and
was
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
after
a
long
afternoon
in
the
sun
a
good
attempt
with
a
nice
feel
that
could
fill
in
as
a
golf
bag
4
pack
in
a
pinch
drinkability
at
first
i
was
a
little
disappointed
however
it
is
growing
on
me
i
like
it
more
and
more
with
each
sip
it
definitely
makes
up
for
the
three
and
a
half
minutes
of
my
life
i
wasted
watching
the
beers
youtube
video
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
making
each
sip
crisp
and
refreshing
the
low
alcohol
content
crisp
refreshing
feel
and
subtle
and
wellbalanced
flavoring
make
this
an
excellent
session
beer
though
a
tad
on
the
expensive
side
o
i
love
galaxy
hops
and
it
really
adds
a
great
character
to
brews
i
will
be
doing
a
blind
comparison
between
this
and
arrowhead
from
marshall
to
see
which
i
like
better
this
is
one
refreshing
crisp
beer
that
is
a
all
around
great
beverage
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
and
interesting
at
that
the
use
of
galaxy
hops
brings
something
new
and
different
to
the
beer
ironic
considering
the
retro
name
smells
and
tastes
very
tropical
papaya
passionfruit
and
mango
with
a
mostly
sweet
malt
presence
accompanied
with
some
onion
garlic
garnishes
and
medium
levels
of
floral
bouquet
once
the
glass
was
allowed
to
warm
up
some
towards
room
temp
crisply
carbonated
medium
body
and
the
finish
adds
a
peppery
hop
aspect
that
complements
the
tropical
fruit
salad
quite
nicely
still
if
you
dont
like
your
pale
ales
sweet
and
fruity
you
most
certainly
wont
like
this
one
it
can
get
cloying
if
you
dont
take
your
time
properly
with
it
this
galaxy
hop
is
both
unique
and
pleasant
to
the
palate
i
like
the
bitter
dominance
of
the
beer
the
lack
of
malty
sweetness
i
still
think
this
reminds
me
alot
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
perhaps
thats
why
i
am
digging
it
recommended
o
easily
an
above
average
pale
ale
i
would
gladly
recommend
loved
the
can
art
too
very
delicious
beer
definitely
a
hit
from
tallgrass
overall
good
packaging
great
taste
sessionable
very
goodlooking
what
isnt
to
like
about
this
brew
i
actually
drank
my
first
one
straight
out
of
the
can
and
liked
it
so
much
i
decided
to
actually
pour
another
one
and
review
it
i
didnt
have
any
intention
of
reviewing
a
beer
tonight
but
this
one
was
just
too
good
excellent
job
by
tallgrass
probably
one
of
my
new
favorite
apas
out
there
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
hop
action
out
of
this
beer
especially
considering
its
galaxy
hopped
but
there
is
just
the
slightest
hint
of
that
juicy
tropical
fruit
that
galaxy
is
known
for
and
i
only
think
i
picked
up
on
it
because
i
was
searching
for
it
otherwise
its
a
decent
drinker
took
some
to
a
bbq
and
it
was
simplistic
enough
to
not
scare
away
the
bmc
drinkers
and
it
seemed
to
pair
with
all
of
the
food
just
fine
overall
8bit
pale
ale
is
an
easy
drink
with
an
interesting
mix
of
hop
flavors
thanks
to
our
little
green
friends
from
new
zealand
if
they
made
more
of
an
impression
on
the
palate
and
the
nose
the
beer
would
have
made
a
much
greater
impression
with
me
overall
the
beer
did
take
me
back
to
the
day
the
atari
2600
was
released
and
thats
a
great
memory
i
enjoyed
my
apa
and
found
it
to
be
an
easy
drinking
and
was
looking
for
the
malt
flavor
to
be
more
noticable
i
may
even
make
a
cheddar
soup
with
this
great
job
tallgrass
this
is
my
favorite
brew
from
these
guys
go
atari
nes
and
sega
nice
light
smooth
easy
drinker
still
lots
of
flavor
cant
go
wrong
here
probably
wont
blow
beer
nerds
away
but
i
could
drink
this
guy
all
day
long
cool
can
bright
gold
with
big
swamp
bubbles
of
white
foam
pour
carefully
or
expect
a
clump
of
beerclouding
yeast
to
plop
into
the
glass
i
was
expecting
to
be
blasted
by
galaxy
hops
but
instead
find
a
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
lightly
grainy
malt
with
a
biscuit
note
stands
about
evenly
with
the
citrus
and
melon
from
the
galaxy
all
around
solid
and
fairly
unique
not
to
mention
it
comes
in
cans
which
are
great
for
warm
weather
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bobby91w
for
sending
this
one
my
way
in
a
recent
trade
as
an
extra
ive
heard
good
things
so
lets
do
this
served
from
can
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
remained
throughout
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
wild
onion
onion
hop
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
onion
hop
spicy
hop
earth
wild
onion
and
subtle
orange
zest
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
brew
really
shocked
me
as
far
as
all
of
the
elements
going
on
in
it
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
tonedback
gubna
in
a
way
only
in
pale
ale
form
this
is
definitely
a
good
thing
incase
you
were
wondering
the
aromas
coming
off
of
this
thing
smelled
intense
enough
to
be
an
ipa
but
still
delicate
enough
to
give
the
hint
that
it
is
a
pale
ale
really
well
done
on
this
aspect
the
flavor
was
quite
nice
and
refreshing
as
well
with
a
little
bit
of
spicy
hoppiness
biting
you
on
the
followthrough
definitely
worth
your
time
seeking
this
one
out
to
try
at
least
once
im
glad
that
i
did
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
the
head
was
a
little
fizzy
and
white
didnt
leave
much
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
with
some
malts
shining
through
the
taste
was
on
the
bitter
side
nothing
too
strong
like
an
ipa
would
be
there
was
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
beginning
of
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
has
a
pretty
sharp
feeling
carbonation
to
it
overall
the
beer
is
drinkable
its
not
something
that
really
impressed
me
but
its
decent
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
great
apa
i
would
buy
this
again
iif
some
of
my
go
tos
were
not
availible
first
off
i
gotta
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
coolest
cans
ive
seen
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowish
gold
dense
white
heads
that
retains
as
a
thin
coating
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
starts
with
lemon
and
grass
with
a
bit
of
bread
coming
through
as
it
progresses
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
caramel
sweetness
the
hops
balance
out
the
sweetness
with
a
swift
bitter
finish
of
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
with
some
similarities
to
daisy
cutter
the
galaxy
hops
dont
shine
through
like
i
was
hoping
but
then
again
i
dont
know
how
fresh
this
can
is
nice
apa
in
a
cool
looking
can
love
the
galaxy
hops
and
they
really
let
them
shine
the
yeast
is
recognizable
from
the
rest
of
the
line
up
very
good
overall
the
citrus
really
comes
out
when
warm
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
orange
color
the
head
is
a
massive
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
inch
cap
of
bright
white
foam
this
is
one
handsome
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
of
stone
fruit
passion
fruit
tangerines
and
flower
bed
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
aroma
and
it
is
also
quite
strong
for
the
size
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
a
bit
drier
than
the
aroma
leads
on
but
i
am
really
liking
that
there
is
ample
passion
fruit
and
stone
fruit
with
some
nice
floral
notes
rounding
out
the
back
end
the
malt
is
present
but
soft
it
supports
the
hops
well
and
really
lets
them
shine
there
is
a
nice
assertive
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
it
is
well
integrated
into
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
drank
i
cant
see
how
this
beer
could
possibly
be
improved
on
it
is
sure
to
become
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
picked
up
a
4
pack
nice
looking
can
to
this
old
atari
fan
this
is
a
good
quality
drinkable
pale
ale
the
hops
seem
more
pilsnerlike
than
citrusy
but
that
doesnt
detract
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
dryness
good
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
easily
approachable
a
well
rounded
brew
without
much
wow
factory
beyond
the
fact
that
it
is
easily
drinkable
it
boasts
just
enough
hop
flavoring
to
keep
me
interested
throughout
the
duration
i
could
see
myself
firing
back
a
few
of
these
effortlessly
in
the
summer
not
bad
thanks
jason
pretty
good
apa
very
nice
citrus
notes
with
a
good
malt
backbone
solid
brew
i
have
been
experimenting
with
fruity
alcopops
of
late
for
reasons
unbeknown
even
to
me
i
hate
when
my
brain
starts
keeping
secrets
but
one
whiff
of
this
fruity
little
gem
and
i
knew
i
was
back
where
i
belong
the
crack
glug
was
unremarkable
and
the
pour
produced
just
over
a
finger
of
fluffy
bone
white
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
hazy
orangishyellow
suggesting
a
nonfiltering
good
and
b
cancanditioning
better
the
nose
was
tropical
fruity
and
i
cheated
and
looked
at
a
descriptor
for
galaxy
hops
which
mentioned
passionfruit
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ever
ate
it
or
smelled
it
so
i
feel
partially
unqualified
to
comment
it
was
definitely
fruity
on
the
nose
however
and
in
a
natural
not
chemicallyadded
esters
way
it
seemed
to
just
open
up
like
a
flower
on
my
tongue
i
got
an
initial
sweet
fruitiness
followed
by
a
rush
of
grapefruit
yow
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
cooler
for
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
feb
annually
for
something
like
this
i
am
planning
a
trip
to
the
beach
this
summer
with
the
stated
intent
of
getting
me
and
everyone
around
me
krunked
this
will
help
yo
im
licking
my
lips
like
pacman
you
hear
finish
was
a
reminder
of
why
i
became
a
hophead
in
the
first
place
fruity
partially
dry
with
the
citrus
hops
yummy
in
my
mouth
and
tummy
i
am
hereby
giving
notice
the
canquest
tm
is
back
nice
mouthfeel
its
lightly
sweet
and
wet
with
a
soft
carbonation
tingle
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
apa
with
a
few
tweaks
it
could
enter
into
the
conversation
of
some
of
the
midwestplains
best
apas
overall
easy
drinking
easily
sessionable
will
have
to
seek
out
a
fresher
sample
to
compare
as
it
seems
to
be
lacking
the
distinctive
tropicalcitrus
notes
of
galaxy
hops
but
is
still
solid
and
well
put
together
thanks
again
to
cpolking
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
floral
some
malts
as
well
taste
is
a
good
hopmalt
balance
a
light
citrus
flavor
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
good
flavor
for
a
pale
alestarts
out
with
a
slight
sweetness
from
the
malt
but
quickly
gives
way
to
a
fleshy
fruit
note
from
the
hops
and
a
lingering
but
not
overpowering
grassypiny
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
and
the
body
is
nearperfection
crisp
wellcarbonated
juicy
mediumthin
body
everything
i
want
in
a
pale
ale
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
from
tallgrass
easy
drinking
on
a
warm
austin
spring
afternoon
o
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
and
with
big
flavor
works
very
nicely
for
the
abv
and
will
be
a
go
to
during
the
summer
for
me
with
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
really
good
melding
of
flavors
and
a
great
look
at
galaxy
hops
the
can
art
isnt
bad
either
this
thing
isnt
pushing
the
envelope
in
any
respects
but
the
galaxy
hops
definitely
make
this
a
somewhat
unique
pale
in
my
mind
its
tasty
smells
good
and
its
very
drinkable
making
this
a
fantastic
summer
beer
o
another
nice
beer
from
tallgrass
i
can
never
get
enough
hoppy
canned
beersso
thanks
tallgrass
o
pretty
unimpressive
pale
ale
the
flavor
and
aroma
just
arnt
there
would
not
buy
again
an
enjoyable
and
slightly
unique
pale
ale
definately
worth
a
try
and
i
certainly
will
buy
it
occasionally
theres
a
strong
possibility
this
is
the
best
beer
yet
from
tallgrass
really
enjoyable
its
a
tasty
treat
win
load
up
the
flavor
in
this
easily
sessionable
beer
o
not
a
particularly
good
pale
ale
the
veggie
flavors
are
a
bit
distracting
and
detrimental
to
the
beer
as
a
whole
i
love
the
can
though
overall
i
dont
like
this
beer
it
is
more
bitter
than
the
taste
would
suggest
there
should
be
much
more
flavor
here
i
just
dont
get
this
beer
i
even
like
galaxy
hops
so
i
expected
much
more
from
this
beer
o
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
its
very
drinkable
and
the
hop
presence
doesnt
overwhelm
you
like
the
bigger
abv
beers
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
american
pale
ale
hops
are
nicely
sharp
and
crisp
and
the
malts
add
a
nice
bready
taste
i
should
buy
more
tallgrass
because
its
good
stuff
this
brew
is
no
exception
the
use
of
the
hops
is
just
lovely
restrained
gives
the
beer
a
gorgeous
profile
excellent
beer
that
ill
grab
again
hope
it
keeps
coming
through
fresh
golden
yellow
pour
with
generous
amounts
of
head
smells
of
pilsner
malt
honey
citrus
lemon
floral
hops
tastes
bitter
up
front
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
a
bit
of
honey
flavor
and
grassy
medium
body
and
well
carbonated
lacing
stayed
til
the
end
of
the
glass
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
ale
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
apa
which
is
right
up
my
alley
also
awesome
artwork
on
the
can
o
really
solid
and
refreshing
beer
nice
hop
characteristics
without
being
as
pungent
and
in
your
face
as
the
big
ipadipas
i
usually
gravitate
towards
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
lemon
with
biscuit
malt
aftertaste
finishes
dry
not
a
completely
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
combination
of
flavors
either
guess
im
not
a
big
fan
of
galaxy
hops
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
ill
be
honest
i
bought
it
because
the
can
is
pretty
cool
a
tad
too
unbalanced
if
there
were
just
a
hint
of
more
malts
it
would
be
really
good
overall
this
is
a
very
good
apa
is
it
my
favorite
probably
not
but
there
are
a
lot
of
good
apas
out
there
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
one
certainly
can
hang
up
there
with
some
of
the
top
rated
ones
though
thank
you
very
much
to
timmyj21
for
this
as
an
extra
in
our
recent
trade
o
great
drinkability
may
be
my
new
go
too
summer
session
beer
love
the
lower
abv
the
can
design
is
pretty
damn
sweet
too
good
summer
beer
wasnt
looking
for
anything
spectacular
and
didnt
get
it
but
i
would
go
back
to
8bit
for
schizzle
i
was
almost
sold
by
the
look
and
the
smell
but
the
taste
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
smells
like
delicious
hops
tastes
like
undelicious
hops
dont
plan
on
drinking
too
much
of
this
notes
moderate
in
body
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
flavor
is
intense
but
finishes
extremely
clean
8bit
is
a
very
easytodrink
brew
and
quite
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
tallgrass
offerings
thus
far
16oz
can
served
in
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
fine
bubbled
white
head
lots
of
tropical
fruit
in
the
aroma
very
fragrant
a
little
bready
malt
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
as
bitter
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
but
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
bit
of
drying
mouth
pucker
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
overall
one
sip
and
youll
know
that
tallgrass
has
a
winner
with
their
8bit
pale
ale
its
light
on
the
palate
with
a
lot
of
great
flavor
and
a
crisp
finish
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bite
to
be
super
refreshing
and
draw
you
back
in
for
more
this
could
be
a
go
to
beer
as
the
weather
begins
to
warm
excellent
work
tallgrass
o
very
session
able
very
tasty
with
hops
and
slight
malts
creamy
finish
very
good
overall
pretty
good
i
could
certainly
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
good
balance
of
flavors
and
a
well
hopped
pale
ale
for
hop
heads
like
me
overall
nice
apa
that
actually
manages
to
be
original
in
a
category
that
is
usually
pretty
straightforward
i
hope
this
raises
awareness
and
sales
for
tallgrass
who
while
hit
or
miss
in
my
opinion
definitely
hit
at
least
a
triple
with
this
one
a
hop
forward
pale
ale
with
some
unique
hop
flavor
kind
of
between
a
pale
and
an
ipa
maybe
closer
to
the
latter
this
will
make
a
nice
warm
weather
drinker
mouth
feel
light
mouth
feel
not
heavily
carbonated
overall
the
label
says
a
hoprocketed
pale
ale
which
is
a
good
description
a
definite
on
my
must
buy
again
list
now
to
find
it
on
tap
o
this
is
a
really
good
pale
ale
tallgrass
keeps
getting
better
and
better
with
each
new
brew
really
good
beer
little
lighter
han
an
ipa
but
one
of
tropical
flavor
good
warm
weather
beer
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
deep
yellow
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
rocky
foam
smell
is
of
hops
buscuits
and
pine
maybe
some
hints
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
taste
is
very
hoppy
closer
to
a
ipa
style
not
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
pronounced
pine
and
hop
notes
at
the
beginning
fading
to
a
very
watery
lemon
taste
mouth
feel
is
very
little
carbonation
with
a
very
oily
feeling
not
very
good
overall
a
little
disappointed
based
on
the
ba
score
there
a
lot
better
pale
ales
out
there
final
thoughts
this
is
a
hopped
up
ipa
thats
pretending
it
is
a
regular
pale
ale
its
like
hopitcal
illusion
gone
horribly
wrong
i
probably
would
have
been
a
bit
more
charitable
to
this
one
if
it
was
labelled
an
ipa
but
not
largely
so
it
is
a
beer
that
hits
the
wrong
buttons
for
me
fresh
canned
2242015
poors
out
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
white
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
strong
pine
some
orange
a
little
sweet
caramel
malt
slight
grass
a
little
dankness
and
orange
pungent
in
the
end
taste
is
strong
orange
then
pine
sweet
caramel
little
spicy
medium
bitterness
dry
almost
watery
finish
and
a
lemon
pith
finished
flavor
real
easy
drinker
and
highly
recommended
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
slightly
different
taste
then
others
i
have
had
for
some
reason
it
is
a
hard
beer
to
put
down
and
it
goes
down
really
easy
this
doesnt
rival
isnt
quite
people
are
people
or
hungry
like
the
wolf
but
what
invasion
ever
reaches
that
level
this
is
more
like
save
a
prayer
and
hey
who
wouldnt
want
that
a
very
nice
pale
ale
cloudy
orange
body
with
some
hints
of
amber
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
sits
on
top
really
abnormally
large
head
on
a
normal
pour
aroma
is
very
tropical
lots
of
pineapple
mango
and
some
toasted
malt
aromas
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
tropical
fruity
hop
flavors
with
a
solid
toasty
malt
backbone
carbonation
is
a
bit
off
as
noticed
by
the
huge
head
somewhat
fizzy
and
just
slightly
off
doesnt
take
much
away
from
the
overall
impression
but
is
a
little
strange
can
poured
into
shaker
pint
at
the
condo
in

with

and

overtones
later

barely
resiny

overall
a
strong
ipa
it
is
enjoyable
and
i
will
drink
this
again
found
this
in
a
cruise
and
thought
it
was
the
best
beer
on
the
boat
great
for
warm
weather
and
very
citrus
and
smooth
poured
from
can
into
tapered
pint
glass
cloudy
yellow
color
with
3in
of
head
slowly
dissipating
to
1
in
malty
smooth
at
the
beginning
with
a
nice
crisp
orange
aftertaste
its
incredibly
smooth
with
a
perfect
mouthfeel
of
light
carbonation
to
give
the
tongue
a
tingle
spicy
resinous
hop
nose
with
citrus
and
some
other
fruit
pours
copper
amber
with
a
slight
chill
haze
under
a
2
offwhite
foam
cap
that
descends
to
about
a
quarter
its
original
size
its
very
lacy
it
enters
with
big
fruit
sweetened
with
light
caramel
over
graham
cracker
leading
to
a
very
pleasant
hop
bitter
accent
on
the
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
very
good
beer
with
one
of
the
biggest
orange
twangs
of
any
beer
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
very
mild
carbonation
a
slick
almost
watery
feel
across
the
tongue
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
sweet
malty
aftertaste
that
is
similar
to
the
finish
of
orange
juice
but
with
some
toasted
wheat
bread
in
it
overall
a
good
slightly
above
average
pale
ale
that
id
like
to
try
fresher
since
this
one
was
3
months
old
i
was
hoping
for
more
hops
from
cigar
city
but
this
was
a
good
beer
and
in
line
with
the
style
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
nice
lasting
head
lacing
nose
is
light
citrus
with
mild
hops
taste
is
very
clean
citrusy
with
hints
of
honey
biscuit
has
a
very
pleasant
sweet

that
lingers
throughout
a
very
drinkable

o

tropical

outdoorsy
woodsy

good

presence
great
flavors
for
a
5
pale
and
super
drinkable
i
feel
some
are
underwhelmed
by
this
one
simply
because
pale
ales
of
this
par
are
standard
now
all
i
can
say
is
keep
em
comin
yet
another
apa
that
comes
across
as
an
ipa
but
retaining
enough
body
to
set
it
apart
think
dales
vice
snpa
definitely
not
a
session
ipa
but
definitely
a
beer
that
knows
that
hops
are
the
strong
point
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
ever
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
apa
especially
coming
from
cigar
city
which
btw
is
my
first
beer
from
cigar
city
i
think
some
of
it
was
that
it
was
canned
in
0ctober
and
i
am
drinking
it
in
january
but
i
didnt
realize
the
canned
on
date
until
i
was
back
to
texas
maybe
ill
be
able
to
try
this
fresh
at
a
later
date
and
write
a
new
review
to
sum
up
its
a
basic
wellmade
american
pale
ale
with
a
heftier
malt
side
than
you
might
normally
find
think
sierra
nevada
my
rating
4
25
overall
a
really
good
pale
ale
the
piney
hops
were
right
on
target
for
my
taste
i
could
use
a
little
more
malty
balance
but
none
the
less
a
good
beer
t
light
caramel
and
sweet
bread
lime
peel
papaya
cling
peaches
roselle
and
persimmon
o
very
nice
beer
definitely
1
dimensional
but
what
it
does
it
does
very
well
o
invasion
is
on
the
hoppy
side
but
still
a
very
good
apa
and
a
very
good
beer
in
general
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
tried
wish
i
could
get
this

overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
citrustropical
hops
and
moderate
pale
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
excellent
pale
ale
crisp
and
refreshingly
hoppy
with
a
tropical
citrusy
going
on
that
is
the
type
of
apa
i
usually
fall
in
love
i
could
session
this
the
whole
day
it
does
remind
of
jai
alai
but
easier
o
a
great
session
beer
different
from
many
pale
ales
out
there
due
to
the
vivaciousness
of
the
hops
and
dryness
of
the
malt
worth
checking
out
this
will
have
a
regular
rotation
in
my
fridge
rock
solid
pale
ale
low
bitterness
very
fruity
hop
character
like
lots
of
centennial
or
nz
hops
without
the
funkiness
pretty
bready
finish
wish
it
were
drier
but
all
told
really
great
throw
it
back
pale
ale
cant
imagine
this
beer
selling
badly
pleasing
hopped
up
pale
resins
and
pine
early
then
some
soft
tropical
fruit
in
the
finish
nice
o
a
very
good
session
beer
id
lean
it
more
towards
an
ipa
considering
the
high
hop
bitterness
but
the
moderate
alcohol
level
helps
it
fit
in
the
pale
ale
category
on
my
5th
6pack
this
year
man
this
stuff
is
good
and
at
a
great
price
of
only
8
a
pack
i
find
it
to
be
very
flavorful
and
hoppy
love
this
stuff
serving
type
can
rjt
reminiscent
of
my
favorite
year
round
cigar
city
brew
jai
alai
the
citrus
especially
grapefruit
notes
in
the
hops
for
notable
for
both
the
nose
and
taste
very
fresh
flavor
and
a
beer
for
that
would
be
well
suited
for
those
who
are
not
hopheads
certainly
a
good
option
for
a
session
beer
for
those
interested
in
that
sort
of
thing
this
is
a
very
good
apa
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
at
5
this
is
a
good
day
drinking
beer
good
job
4
this
smells
great
but
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
which
is
disappointing
this
is
a
great
every
day
kind
of
beer
its
been
my
goto
beer
if
im
at
the
bbq
or
out
of
a
boat
its
almost
like
a
jai
alai

grapefruit
pith
o
daisy
cutter
is
exceptional
with
the
level
of
intense
flavor
its
punching
at
it
tastes
like
something
twice
its
size
a
world
class
pale
ale
in
a
can
and
i
hope
i
can
get
ahold
of
more
of
this
in
the
future
its
probably
a
good
thing
for
the
sake
of
my
bank
account
and
marriage
that
i
cant
get
this
beer
locally
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
probabaly
the
best
pale
ale
in
terms
of
a
session
beer
its
perfect
in
all
aspects
all
hail
the
daisy
cutter
draft
into
tulip
glass
medium
cloudy
golden
color
nice
1
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
sticky
lacing
outstanding
aroma
heavy
with
grapefruit
and
pine
very
promising
mouthfeel
and
taste
slightly
underwhelmed
probably
just
because
the
aroma
was
so
good
if
i
could
get
this
regularly
it
would
make
a
near
ideal
session
beer
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
a
solid
pale
ale
love
it
o
i
really
like
this
half
acre
the
store
is
a
blast
good
stuff
2515
finley
dunnes
draft
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
ipa
somewhat
strong
but
not
overpowering
the
beer
went
down
easy
and
smooth
i
liked
the
distinct
taste
and
will
definitely
order
down
the
road
o
4
25
definitely
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
thanks
to
the
always
generous
curiousmonk
the
high
drinkability
is
easily
the
highlight
of
this
beer
and
while
the
flavor
might
not
blow
you
away
its
no
slouch
either
very
well
balanced
and
one
id
certainly
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
im
buying
a
riding
lawnmower
o
this
is
pretty
good
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
its
lighter
flavor
makes
it
seem
like
you
could
drink
several
pints
of
this
at
a
bar
id
definitely
grab
this
if
i
were
out
and
wanted
something
light
its
alright
i
dont
get
the
hype
for
it
i
prefer
boat
beer
by
a
mile
o
pretty
good
but
i
dont
see
why
it
has
as
high
a
score
as
it
does
these
guys
really
need
to
put
some
freshness
dates
on
their
cans
since
i
have
no
idea
if
this
is
the
beer
at
its
best
or
not
i
think
i
got
an
old
can
cant
find
a
date
but
its
just
very
dull
and
watered
down
barely
any
hop
character
and
the
malts
actually
star
but
still
not
anything
special
hoping
i
get
the
chance
to
try
this
fresh
as
i
know
its
going
to
be
great
from
a
can
at
least
2
months
old
great
nose
and
even
better
taste
still
hoppy
and
almost
a
perfect
malt
balance
will
seek
out
again
from
can
first
serving
i
poured
into
glass
while
my
second
serving
i
drank
from
can
i
prefer
drinking
from
the
can
overall
i
always
pick
up
some
of
this
when
im
in
range
distinctive
taste
profile
that
really
hits
some
of
my
favorite
notes
weak
flavor
makes
no
statement
this
is
a
bona
fide
chicago
favorite
hop
forward
apa
with
citrusfloral
notes
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
great
bitter
finish
that
lingers
on
the
tastebuds
one
of
my
go
to
beers
o
a
chicago
staple
and
for
good
reason
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
outstanding
beer
drink
local
poured
at
poor
phils
oak
park
il
juicy
and
balanced
to
the
t
had
a
can
from
have
fives
owner
o
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
quick
ip
trade
and
really
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
it
this
is
definitely
a
great
pale
ale
an
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
pales
ive
had
really
enjoyed
the
drinkablity
of
it
if
i
lived
in
their
distribution
i
would
certainly
have
this
in
my
rotation
i
thought
maybe
there
was
a
touch
of
citra
in
here
given
i
think
it
smells
a
bit
like
zombie
dust
but
all
info
online
seems
to
say
its
warrior
centennial
simcoe
amarillo
and
columbus
maybe
the
combo
of
centennial
and
amarillo
and
simcoe
is
giving
me
that
juicy
friut
hop
aroma
guess
im
not
getting
any
better
at
the
identifying
hop
thing
tried
it
again
to
confirm
my
initial
take
only
from
a
can
this
time
same
impression
this
beer
is
just
not
for
me
very
earthy
and
hoppy
ipa
not
sure
if
it
was
just
the
can
i
had
but
this
one
had
a
sour
taste
i
was
expecting
a
hoptacular
blow
out
but
it
didnt
deliver
o
a
nice
pale
ale
from
half
acre
nothing
really
special
but
nothing
bad
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
a
safe
bet
for
an
always
satisfying
beer
very
good
balanced
brew
that
was
an
extra
i
received
on

its
nevertheless

finger
rises

sticks

brew
aromas
is

floral
hops
pretty

bitterness
up

on

reminds

of
dandelion
brews
i
have
had
in

hop
flavors
trail
off
a
little
quickly
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
west

very
drinkable
light
body
with

got
some
of
this
in

for
pseudo

poured
with

really
nice
looking
cloudy
straw
slightly
orange
body
fresh
citrus
aroma
some
earthy
smell
too
taste
is

very
bitter
but
still
nice
and
juicy
like
eating
fresh
grapefruit
very
weak
tasting
pale
ale
with
good
hop
bitterness
guess
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
an
ipa
o
great
pale
ale
flavorful
for
5
but
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
after
all
of
the
hype
its
no
zd
or
pseudosue
but
i
prefer
this
to
sns
pale
and
coupling
the
aspects
of
affordability
and
availability
this
is
a
hightier
american
pale
that
deserves
attention
from
any
beer
appreciator
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
overall
very
nice
loved
the
smell
and
taste
fairly
hopforward
but
not
over
the
top
it
is
a
terrific
beer
which
is
great
because
id
had
it
on
my
wishlist
for
a
couple
of
years
somehow
i
made
4
or
5
trips
to
chicago
last
year
without
finding
it
not
at
binnys
nor
in
a
restaurant
clean
hoppy
sessionable
with
great
results
overall
really
great
hop
character
and
nicely
wellbalanced
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
o
not
as
sharp
and
tight
as
ive
grown
accustomed
to
but
still
a
standout
punchy
apa
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
definitely
want
to
trade
for
this
and
drink
more
pours
a
hazy
but
brightish
light
copper
medium
head
with
solid
lacing
so
darn
smooth
and
enjoyable
balanced
and
refreshing
with
great
aftertaste
no
where
near
the
bite
or
the
complexity
of
daisy
cutters
brethren
god
hates
astronauts
but
at
5
2
should
be
obvious
recommended
pours
a
clear
gold
color
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
hint
of
earthy
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
alcohol
slight
floral
hops
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
bitterness
is
too
prevalent
for
my
preference
tastes
of
earthy
malt
citrus
hops
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
yeast
overall
good
appearance
earthy
malt
dominates
both
aroma
and
body
otherwise
average
pale
ale
this
was
on
my
wants
list
for
far
too
long
and
i
am
happy
to
say
it
lived
up
to
my
high
expectations
beautiful
color
nice
head
with
lots
of
sticky
retention
the
nose
told
me
i
would
love
this
beer
and
i
did
amazing
fresh
hoppy
flavor
and
excellent
dank
aftertaste
love
it
generally
very
wellintegrated
with
medium
body
but
theres
a
hint
of
aqueousness
on
the
finish
d
very
drinkable
nice
brew
no
overpowering
bitterness
from
hops
more
of
a
malt
presence
than
zd
like
bread
and
biscuits
does
not
seem
to
showcase
a
particular
hop
like
other
apas
just
an
extremely
all
around
well
made
beer
more
even
keeled
than
zd
and
overall
a
better
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
hopforward
american
pale
ale
im
glad
a
bartender
at
a
local
pub
brought
two
pintsized
cans
back
from
his
trip
to
chicago
for
me
more
my
next
time
through
il
this
is
my
goto
beer
whenever
i
need
something
dependable
so
crisp
and
smooth
lightbodied
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
good
for
any
season
theres
not
many
pale
ales
out
there
that
can
compete
with
this
even
better
is
the
brewery
is
right
up
the
street
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
out
there
daisy
cutter
offers
big
hops
from
another
perspective
rather
than
a
fruit
bomb
it
goes
floral
in
fact
i
cannot
think
of
another
pale
ale
or
ipa
that
is
more
clearly
dedicated
to
exploring
this
aspect
of
hop
esters
as
such
it
is
an
innovative
and
delicious
alternative
and
one
i
seek
out
when
i
am
in
the
chicago
area
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
and
its
local
which
is
great
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
sitting
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
love
this
brew
poured
a
cloudy
honey
with
a
quarter
inch
foamy
head
foamy
lacing
mild
fruit
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
mildly
of
fruit
maybe
some
mango
a
bitter
finish
this
beer
felt
weak
to
me
with
an
odd
seltzerlike
mouthfeel
a
decent
ale
but
nothing
special
considering
the
high
ratings
one
i
could
take
or
leave
in
the
future
m
absolutely
fantastic
all
pales
should
strive
for
this
medium
bodied
or
less
maybe
decently
carbonated
incredibly
drinkable
and
crisp
can
from
kevin
thanks
pours
golden
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
and
one

aroma
pale

some
light
honey
sweetness
flavor
follows
with
lots
of
grassiness
and
hay
dry
very
light
malt
sweetness
maybe
a
bit
of
citrus
very
light
bodied
goes
down
super
easy
with
a
dry
finish
and
lots
of
carbonation
good
stuff
wish
i
could
get
this
fresh
all
the
time
must
be
great
to
have
out
on
the
lakes
i
went
to
the
taste
of
randolph
in
chicago
yesterday
nice
warm
day
the
beer
was
served
cold
in
a
can
and
i
poured
it
into
a
plastic
cup
it
poured
nicely
and
looked
wonderful
then
it
tasted
great
this
was
a
perfect
beer
for
the
weather

and
herbal
in
the
taste
more
citrusy
tropical

solid

daisy

is
an
apt
name
for
this

and
resinous
with
a
dry
hop
bite
and
biscuity
malt

medium
smoother

overall
this
is
a
classic
pale
ale
better
than
most
ipas
o
a
solid
repeat
drinker
and
arguably
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
coming
out
of
chicago
proper
found
a

week
old
case
of
16
oz
cans
a
bounds
in
warrington

go
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
i
say
that
with
fff
zombie

which
are
both
bordering
on

a
tad
weak
at
the

only
5
2
percent
really
really
good
stuff
after
hearing
from
friends
in
the
midwest
just
how
great
this
beer
is
i
was
finally
able
to
try
some
for
myself
and
thanks
to
one
of
the
rising
stars
of
the
craft
beer
community
i
was
able
to
buy
it
locally

pittston
whatever
get
there
soon
if
youre
in

this
beer
is
just
fantastic
its
everything
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
crisp
clean
refreshing
with
a
touch
of
fruit
notes
at
the
end
i
poured
the
16oz
can
into
a
snifter
and
sat
on
my
deck
enjoying
the
evening
a
perfect
beer
for
summer
or
anytime
o
always
a
favorite
apa
of
mine
nice
to
finally
review
it
even
though
ive
had
it
multiple
times
o
you
could
mistake
it
for
an
ipa
lots
of
fresh
flavor
notes
scored
this
from
my
wifes
trip
to
schaumburg
overall
it
is
a
great
example
of
an
apa
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
really
nice
flavor
again
west

what
seems
to
be
rye
malts
and
a
very
mild
yeast
character
well
balanced
easy
drinker
slightly
bready
slightly
bitter
just
an
all
around
great
pale
ale
id
buy
often
if
it
was
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
overall
an
incredible
apa
easily
one
of
my
top
3
overall
the
incredible
aroma
and
flavor
are
rounded
out
by
a
supreme
drinkability
at
5
2
it
wont
knock
you
out
and
i
could
easily
drink
three
of
these
without
feeling
fatigued
in
both
sobriety
and
palate
a
fantastic
apa
that
i
highly
recommend
everyone
try
will
be
a
goto
offering
for
me
whenever
im
home
in
il
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
in
a
while
showcasing
a
nice
hop
bill
yet
keeping
all
of
the
drinkability
of
the
style
unfortunately
my
only
can
would
gladly
buy
again
if
given
the
chance
overall
a
tasty
and
impressive
pale
ale
lots
of
taste
and
hop
character
without
leaving
anything
out
a
good
intro
to
half
acre
and
lives
up
to
everything
it
should
solid
pale
ale
i
tend
to
prefer
fruitier
hop
flavorsaromas
than
stood
out
from
this
which
was
more
of
a
bittering
hop
but
it
was
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
by
any
stretch
i
will
certainly
have
this
beer
again
id
love
to
try
the
double
daisy
cutter
if
i
can
ever
find
it
in
philadelphia
overall
4
25
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
better
than
snpa
as
far
as
i
can
rememeber
better
than
mirror
pond
and
yes
better
than
zombie
dust
by
a
fair
margin
if
you
ask
me
im
surprised
this
isnt
rated
significantly
higher
od
quite
a
hoppy
pale
ale
nice
stuff
but
a
little
plain
hop
flavour
could
be
cleaned
up
a
bit
otherwise
i
enjoyed
the
pint
not
terribly
drinkable
o
a
nice
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
the
best
session
beer
ive
had
very
light
in
the
mouth
but
full
in
flavor
crisp
and
clean
amazingly
well
done
o
very
well
done
i
want
to
try
the
other
offerings
now
its
a
crushable
pale
ale
that
to
a
lot
of
people
could
be
considered
an
ipa
a
great
flagship
beer
for
any
brewery
daisy
cutter
is
an
impressive
and
wellcrafted
pale
ale
the
estery
aromas
and
flowers
explode
from
this
one
with
citrusy
notes
and
bready
malts
left
in
the
aftermath
great
beer
find
this
one
o
a
very
solid
pale
ale
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
fruity
though
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
desirable
and
will
seek
out
again
very
much
ipa
notes
but
with
a
lighter
body
of
a
pale
ale
great
session
hoppy
beer
o
stellar
pale
ale
bonus
points
for
the
pounder
can
now
if
only
i
had
regular
access
to
this
total
4150
not
as
fruity
as
i
would
like
but
overall
a
well
done
five
hopped
up
craft
very
straight
forward
pale
ale
with
no
frills
except
the
aroma
is
sensational
hop
lovers
dreamcant
even
begin
to
imagine
what
the
double
is
like
overall
really
delicious
really
excellent
pale
ale
lovely
hop
character
super
aromatic
but
also
super
drinkable
not
only
could
i
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
simply
smelling
this
beer
i
could
also
drink
it
all
day
overall
very
nice
pale
juicy
and
hop
forward
without
being
too
bitter
but
is
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
first
time
it
showed
up
in
my
area
and
i
think
i
will
be
getting
more
o
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
like
galactic
double
daisy
cutter
a
bit
more
but
this
is
incredibly
easy
drinking
would
be
great
in
the
warm
summer
months
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
appearance
is
a
light
copper
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
that
left
some
frothy
lace
behind
the
nose
is
nicely
hoppy
this
offering
has
some
fizziness
that
becomes
noticeable
as
one
begins
sipping
on
it
the
body
is
light
and
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
a
pleasing
hop
finish
this
is
a
bit
lighter
in
body
than
the
best
apas
but
it
would
certainly
be
something
perfect
to
knock
back
in
mass
quantities
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
down
a
dozen
of
these
o
very
good
pale
ale
will
definitely
be
picking
some
up
the
next
time
im
around
chicago
could
see
myself
enjoying
on
manyasummer
days
i
was
blessed
to
hook
up
with
a
cigar
smoking
buddy
traded
some
cigars
for
this
beer
a
whole
four
pack
to
be
exact
it
pours
a
perfect
copper
slightly
hazed
glowing
orange
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
aroma
has
floral
citrus
hop
notes
with
ample
malt
fresh
sliced
bread
as
it
warms
up
more
orange
slices
with
a
bit
of
crush
aspirin
and
orange
zest
makes
its
way
into
my
nares
a
good
combo
with
the
ample
tame
sweetness
of
the
balancing
malt
character
flavor
wise
it
hits
the
palate
with
enough
hops
to
keep
this
hop
head
interested
great
citrus
zest
bitterness
floral
notes
with
a
sweet
honey
biscuit
malt
to
bring
it
home
into
a
balance
hops
shine
through
to
the
finish
nice
bone
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
ample
smooth
natural
carbonation
cans
are
the
way
to
go
for
these
guys
overall
drinkability
is
great
sessionable
crazy
good
stuff
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
i
shared
one
can
drank
two
on
arrival
and
saved
one
for
a
review
it
went
so
fast
overall
a
great
apa
with
a
huge
hoppy
profile
and
a
lower
sessionable
abv
definitely
a
beer
to
sit
pack
and
have
a
few
if
you
love
hops
then
this
is
the
pale
ale
for
you
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hops
this
is
an
excellent
beer
hops
do
not
just
dominate
they
overwhelm
this
brew
really
should
have
been
labeled
an
ipa
as
it
is
far
hoppier
than
most
ipas
if
you
favor
more
balanced
beers
you
probably
will
not
like
this
beer
even
though
it
is
well
made
o
a
bit
tart
and
very
flavorful
a
nice
allaround
pale
ale
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
great
white
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
the
smell
is
unique
slightly
citrusy
but
really
grassyweedy
i
swear
i
smell
dope
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
that
citrusweedy
hop
flavor
this
is
a
great
highly
quaffable
and
rather
unique
tasting
pale
ale
a
lot
drier
but
more
powerful
than
most
o
a
great
pale
ale
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
this
one
overall
a
real
treat
of
a
pale
ale
a
beer
you
could
drink
all
day
and
night
and
never
get
sick
of
very
recommended
o
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
some
great
pale
ales
this
summer
moon
man
odd
side
cpa
zombie
dust
and
this
beer
belongs
right
in
that
mix
i
am
fortunate
to
have
gotten
a
four
pack
in
chicago
unfortunately
like
the
others
mentioned
this
is
not
available
in
ohio
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
but
it
was
spot
on
with
good
carbonation
it
was
clean
crisp
and
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
like
i
said
above
one
of
the
best
o
im
not
much
of
a
pale
ale
fan
but
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
brew
fresh
i
can
think
of
very
few
things
id
rather
have
on
an
easygoing
afternoon
this
beer
is
wonderfully
drinkable
i
am
really
a
fan
of
the
hop
selection
for
this
although
maybe
its
just
a
little
too
bitter
id
definitely
drink
this
again
though
and
would
probably
keep
it
onhand
if
i
had
regular
access
to
it
o
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
its
light
and
extremely
drinkable
but
is
also
loaded
with
flavor
its
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
im
so
pumped
that
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
thanks
a
ton
jared
very
clean
and
very
nicely
balanced
bright
flavors
on
the
palate
the
hops
are
nicely
displayed
without
being
over
the
top
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
fresh
can
poured
into
a
plastic
glass
looks
to
have
a
sticky
white
lacing
just
a
bit
cloudy
with
dark
golden
color
and
lots
of
bubbles
aroma
is
typical
ipa
hop
profile
is
a
bit
grassy
with
pine
and
a
hint
of
citrus
bready
malt
the
malt
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
to
the
hops
taste
is
nearly
identical
to
the
aroma
hoppy
first
with
a
malty
body
and
finishes
pretty
quickly
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
resins
finish
high
carbonation
low
alcohol
presence
overall
a
solid
ipa
but
nothing
jumps
out
with
this
beer
o
overall
a
good
drinking
pale
with
a
higher
edge
of
hoppiness
and
malt
depth
with
sparkling
carbonation
gives
this
added
appeal
touch
of
lingering
flowery
hop
dryness
on
the
close
feels
closer
to
a
ipa
standards
crisp
and
very
good
rating
procured
at
a
trader
joes
north
of
downtown
chicago
near
the
botanic
gardens
in
a
four
pack
of
pint
cans
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
maybe
the
best
ive
had
from
chicago
it
has
a
rather
large
hop
nose
english
in
some
ways
more
bitter
than
dank
or
fruity
there
is
also
a
soft
floral
element
that
comes
across
like
the
flowers
on
the
can
are
actually
in
the
can
polleny
and
springtimey
and
gloriously
grassy
good
malt
balance
english
and
american
mixed
lighter
than
it
seems
with
a
fresh
cut
hay
and
rising
bread
complexion
the
flavor
is
the
best
parts
of
the
nose
more
hoppy
than
i
first
though
super
different
from
the
standard
and
expertly
made
the
quality
of
this
beer
is
most
apparent
in
the
feel
though
which
is
creamy
without
being
heavy
bubbly
without
being
aggressive
and
clean
without
being
immaculate
its
really
fantastic
beer
and
an
exceptional
introduction
to
half
acre
beer
the
floral
finish
and
the
bright
hops
and
diverse
malt
unification
make
this
a
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
in
upstate
new
york
where
i
am
spending
this
summer
or
in
denver
where
i
live
this
would
be
an
everyday
brew
for
me
tastefeel
and
with
the
taste
and
feel
its
the
same
old
song
and
dance
and
i
love
that
i
enjoyed
the
smell
a
lot
and
the
taste
gave
me
the
same
thing
a
lot
of
floral
flavors
on
the
front
turn
to
some
semisweet
malts
and
then
theres
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
pretty
dry
finish
that
i
just
really
enjoy
its
hard
to
stop
sipping
this
beer
as
its
truly
outstanding
worthy
of
the
hype
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
looking
forward
to
future
beers
from
half
acre
o
i
loved
this
one
another
apa
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
overall
as
a
disclaimer
i
am
still
learning
to
appreciate
this
style
this
beer
goes
well
with
food
as
it
is
not
too
strong
and
the
hoppiness
is
not
at
all
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
very
drinkable
o
excellent
i
had
heard
good
things
and
mostly
they
were
on
the
money
good
citrus
and
floral
punch
but
the
sweetness
and
maltyness
surprised
me
a
nice
surprise
it
was
top
notch
for
the
style
maybe
the
perfect
beer
to
have
while
lounging
in
the
sun
and
my
personal
2
american
pale
ale
overall
really
good
beer
from
the
moment
you
open
it
is
exactly
what
you
expect
from
the
nose
which
is
a
good
thing
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
but
it
didnt
knock
me
off
my
feet
highly
drinkable
tasty
and
extremely
flavorful
pale
ale
what
else
can
you
say
if
this
were
available
near
me
it
would
definitely
be
one
of
my
goto
beers
given
the
fact
that
it
drinks
as
easy
as
water
and
its
only
5
2
abv
plus
i
love
beers
that
come
in
16
oz
cans
if
youre
a
pale
ale
fan
get
you
some
daisy
cutter
right
away
this
is
my
first
experience
with
half
acre
beer
company
daisy
cutter
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
while
its
not
quite
the
best
american
pale
ale
on
the
planet
it
is
a
fine
one
its
very
tasty
wellbalanced
and
accomplished
in
just
about
every
aspect
its
definitely
worth
seeking
out
thanks
chris
definitely
a
strong
offering
from
a
new
brewery
to
me
im
now
pissed
i
didnt
know
about
them
sooner
when
i
was
in
chicago
or
else
i
wouldve
made
sure
to
visit
the
brewery
oh
well
next
time
o
overall
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
one
its
a
good
beer
but
personally
i
prefer
my
apa
on
the
hoppier
side
of
the
spectrum
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
i
dont
think
itd
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
even
if
it
was
available
locally
poured
a
copper
color
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
produced
a
nice
bright
white
head
the
head
dissipated
momentarily
leaving
lacing
along
the
rim
of
the
glass
on
detects
a
good
hop
profile
in
the
aroma
with
notes
of
grass
and
citrus
fruit
the
aroma
allows
the
drinker
to
know
immediately
that
this
is
a
pale
ale
on
the
initial
taste
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
strikes
me
the
most
the
carbonation
is
less
than
abrasive
allowing
the
smoothness
to
shine
in
the
initial
taste
one
detects
lemon
grass
orange
rind
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
as
the
taste
hades
to
the
back
of
the
throat
the
lemon
is
most
apparent
with
the
other
notes
fading
to
the
sides
it
is
a
hot
day
and
i
do
find
this
to
be
an
easy
drinker
the
taste
itself
does
not
strike
me
as
being
particularly
complex
in
the
big
picture
this
is
a
subtle
and
smooth
pale
ale
light
oragne
color
11
5
white
head
has
a
bitter
herb
aroma
daisys
maybe
im
looking
at
the
can
too
much
which
is
awesome
some
grassiness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
pretty
smooth
going
down
leaves
a
touch
of
lingering
bitterness
golden
orange
hazy
a
half
inch
of
chunky
foam
that
laces
nicely
waves
of
tangerine
lemon
zest
grapefruit
rind
and
fresh
pine
on
the
nose
very
nice
taste
is
delicate
orange
citrus
lightly
grassy
and
light
maltiness
lightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
soft
carbonation
this
smells
like
a
million
bucks
but
the
taste
doesnt
reach
the
same
heights
decent
overall
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
gold
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
persists
forever
leaving
lots
of
stickies
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aromas
of
grapefruit
pineapple
and
a
hint
of
earth
and
flowers
dominate
the
aroma
allowing
a
light
bready
malt
to
barely
peak
through
the
flavor
is
bready
and
honey
like
malt
underneath
a
solid
base
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
firm
hop
bitterness
is
never
harsh
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
wow
thats
a
fantastic
pale
ale
right
there
ill
generally
go
into
bat
for
little
creatures
at
its
best
as
a
very
good
pale
ale
but
this
leaves
it
well
in
the
shade
superbly
drinkable
amazing
to
smell
and
looks
a
treat
nice
hop
fix
wish
we
had
something
in
australia
that
comes
close
mf
light
to
medium
bodied
gave
me
a
coated
feeling
get
it
my
children
get
it
good
o
pretty
dull
honestly
i
feel
left
hanging
i
keep
waiting
for
the
burst
of
flavor
and
every
sip
i
am
let
down
this
flowerygrassdirt
taste
is
just
not
appealing
aside
from
the
look
i
would
not
talk
highly
of
this
d
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
generous
dose
of
hops
added
to
the
mix
but
enough
malty
goodness
to
bring
it
back
down
to
earth
flavorful
but
balanced
and
tasty
ill
admit
im
not
a
big
time
hophead
but
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
o
so
drinkable
and
delicious
great
at
giving
you
a
hop
fix
too
this
beer
smells
fantastic
but
tastes
onedimensional
bitter
very
bitter
and
nothing
else
its
like
they
mixed
water
and
bitterness
together
and
didnt
add
anything
else
i
say
bitterness
and
not
hops
because
there
are
different
hops
out
there
with
various
flavor
characteristics
this
is
one
of
few
beers
i
actively
avoid
drinking
low
b
o
great
pale
ale
very
refreshing
and
good
flavors
no
wonder
its
called
daisy
cutter
would
be
great
on
a
summers
day
oi
really
enjoyed
tallgrass
8bit
ipa
for
many
of
the
reasons
i
enjoy
daisy
cutter
this
beer
just
executes
better
on
apart
every
level
keep
on
growing
half
acre
this
beer
should
be
in
all
50
states
what
a
great
pale
ale
hits
all
the
high
points
of
this
stye
light
fruity
and
nicely
hopped
great
summer
beer
o
a
great
summer
beer
a
lawnmower
beer
if
you
will
that
you
can
session
and
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
as
hell
a
little
too
onedimensional
to
be
great
but
it
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
and
im
a
fan
overall
drinkability
extra
points
for
apt
name
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
was
very
very
good
served
in
a
plastic
cup
pint
st
patricks
day
weekend
at
the
temple
bar
in
chicago
good
aroma
off
a
one
inch
head
very
bright
and
clean
that
surprises
you
off
the
first
drink
with
a
what
was
that
mouthfeel
floral
grassy
and
grapefruit
in
the
best
possible
way
i
will
say
that
i
liked
the
first
pint
better
than
the
second
and
third
but
will
definitely
drink
this
one
any
time
i
find
it
i
am
just
close
enough
to
chicago
that
i
will
try
to
hunt
down
the
cans
o
another
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
here
in
ma
would
easily
be
a
regular
in
the
warmer
months
for
the
beach
and
boat
and
drank
straight
from
the
can
of
course
i
would
like
to
thank
my
good
friend
vince
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
great
american
pale
ale
i
found
it
hard
to
put
this
beer
down
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
could
find
it
in
my
part
of
the
country
overall
if
this
had
been
released
in
the
late
70s
or
early
80s
it
would
have
been
labelled
an
ipa
for
sure
despite
the
bitterness
level
it
has
a
greater
perceived
bitterness
due
to
the
malt
balance
but
times
have
changed
this
reminds
me
of
a
super
ampedup
version
of
another
wellknown
pale
ale
its
not
as
refined
to
be
sure
but
it
makes
up
for
that
in
presence
or
should
i
just
say
in
your
face
character
its
the
modern
day
version
of
an
american
pale
ale
worth
trying
overall
what
a
great
drinkable
apa
i
could
put
down
a
4
pack
of
pint
cans
without
a
problem
the
body
is
limited
i
would
like
to
see
more
balance
here
carbonation
is
good
overall
a
very
nice
hop
up
front
character
that
rivals
legitimate
ipas
but
would
like
to
see
more
balance
from
the
bittering
hops
and
maltiness
pours
a
cloudy
bright
orange
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
a
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
nice
thick
lacing
nice
carbonation
coming
off
the
glass
how
a
pale
ale
should
look
smells
of
tons
of
floral
notes
some
resinous
dank
qualities
grapefruit
a
soapy
quality
to
it
some
juicy
fruits
like
pineapple
do
get
some
bread
and
grain
as
well
from
the
malt
taste
starts
with
some
resinous
yet
juicy
qualities
from
the
hops
such
as
grapefruit
just
tons
of
floral
almost
a
perfumelike
flavor
then
the
middle
brings
some
balance
with
wheat
notes
grain
and
carmel
get
some
qualities
here
that
may
suggest
some
to
say
it
is
watered
down
but
i
disagree
the
finish
is
more
of
the
prominent
floral
qualities
of
the
hops

a
fairly
hazy
orange
with
just
a
dusting
of
tangerine
along
the
edges
when
the
beer
is

there
are
about

of

sitting

the

after
the

it
just

apex

spotty

lots

not

the
flavor
has
a
little
bit
of
bready

up

along
with
a

mild

appropriate
bitterness
the
hoppy
finish
just
screams
centennial
hops
which
arent
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
bitter
grapefruit
flavor
not
entirely
pleasant
and
theres
a
little
bit
of
grassiness
as
well
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
just
a
little
bit
of
firmness
to
it
the
carbonation
is
a
little
bubbly
though
if
i
was
being
picky
i
would
say
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
so
daisy
cutters
a
solid
pale
ale
but
given
that
its
not
distributed
anywhere
near
me
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
some
more
overall
in
my
opinion
what
a
easy
drinking
apa
be
straightforward
awesome
citrus
hops
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
darling
of
an
american
pale
ale
an
absolute
delight
to
drink
lots
of
flavor
and
it
all
melds
together
perfectly
without
weighing
the
beer
down
nice
packaging
too
i
really
dig
the
tallboy
cans
if
they
could
make
it
a
six
pack
of
tallboys
and
keep
it
fairly
priced
a
la
the
narragansett
seasonals
theyd
make
a
killing
half
acre
if
you
guys
are
ever
looking
to
expand
distribution
do
not
hesitate
to
come
to
ma
if
i
were
the
only
one
buying
this
beer
id
still
keep
you
in
business
i
really
enjoyed
this
guy
love
the
layering
of
flavors
from
the
hops
this
is
welcome
in
my
glass
anytime
another
beer
courtesy
of
cpolking
and
his
recent
package
thanks
man
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
big
on
hops
lots
of
citrus
taste
is
hoppy
up
front
tart
a
good
bit
of
citrus
a
malt
balance
is
present
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
quality
brew
worth
seeking
out
enjoyed
at
the
hyatt
regency
ohare
red
bar
this
pale
ale
shows
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
healthy
white
foam
and
good
lacing
to
boot
the
aroma
brings
pronounced
grasscitrus
hops
and
nuttyearthy
malt
very
nice
and
pleasantly
hoppy
for
a
pale
the
flavor
is
a
clean
grass
hop
with
a
lemony
edge
over
mild
bready
caramel
malt
light
but
not
watery
at
all
with
a
very
sessionable
but
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
very
nice
and
probably
something
that
will
please
anyone
that
is
tolerable
of
hops
overall
an
excellent
pale
ale
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
good
balance
between
hop
flavor
and
bittering
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
brewery
is
very
good
as
well
great
beer
o
a
brilliantly
complex
and
flavorful
apa
its
different
but
good
mouthfeel
is
slightly
off
but
otherwise
topnotch
definitely
one
of
the
best
session
ales
you
can
get
in
the
chicago
area
great
tasting
excellent
smelling
pale
this
is
a
really
nice
pale
ale
the
addition
of
the
sweet
fruit
like
pineapple
is
well
balanced
with
the
citrus
fruits
i
would
look
for
this
again
i
had
this
on
st
patricks
day
2012
at
a
bar
in
downtown
chicago
out
of
a
plastic
cup
nonetheless
still
was
delicious
a
surprise
find
to
be
sure
wish
i
could
have
another
overall
great
flavours
in
a
nice
ballance
but
mild
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
and
more
lived
up
to
my
expectations
which
is
always
nice
m
did
i
mention
stunning
fresh
this
pale
ale
laps
most
if
not
all
others
nicely
done
o
with
half
acre
mostly
daisy
cutter
being
new
to
pa
im
wondering
if
the
keg
had
been
sitting
a
little
bit
i
understand
this
is
an
apa
but
other
reviews
and
people
suggest
there
is
more
citrus
flavors
when
this
one
is
fresh
overall
better
yes
but
its
also
a
classic
hoppy
pale
ale
for
the
hop
heads
not
so
much
driven
to
this
one
but
things
could
be
far
worse
drinkability
cheers
to
half
acre
for
getting
so
much
out
of
5
2
a
ton
of
hop
character
in
this
one
and
it
definitely
seems
to
be
what
they
do
best
this
would
have
paired
wonderfully
with
some
sharp
cheddar
and
can
imagine
it
being
a
really
great
thirst
quencher
ipa
overall
i
waited
to
write
this
review
as
i
was
finishing
up
this
beer
i
was
excited
through
most
of
it
but
maybe
as
it
warmed
the
taste
of
a
pale
ale
was
really
starting
to
show
i
guess
im
more
of
a
hop
head
than
this
beer
has
to
offer
but
it
was
still
a
very
well
made
beer
ranks
up
high
for
me
for
a
pale
cost
9
99
for
a
four
pack
o
i
doubt
a
distributor
would
enter
a
market
with
a
perishable
product
with
questionable
freshness
but
i
cant
even
imagine
this
beer
was
at
its
peak
this
beer
was
just
tapped
minutes
before
my
serving
and
the
keg
basically
came
off
of
the
truck
sooo
i
guess
ill
have
to
revisit
this
down
the
road
d
good
sessionable
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
its
nice
4443
543
93
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
first
half
acre
brew
ive
had
i
will
seek
out
more
i
guess
its
only
5
2
abv
but
otherwise
im
surprised
this
isnt
considered
an
ipa
even
then
i
prefer
my
pale
ales
with
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
very
nice
to
see
a
session
beer
with
this
kind
of
flavor
o
very
grassyfloral
rather
than
citrusypiney
reading
the
other
reviews
i
see
a
lot
of
mentions
of
strong
citrus
notes
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
i
dont
really
get
that
and
ive
had
dc
many
times
ontap
and
in
the
can
still
decent
overall
this
is
a
great
apa
i
believe
i
said
that
three
floyds
zombie
dust
was
one
of
the
best
apas
i
had
ever
tried
in
my
review
of
it
daisy
cutter
might
just
be
better
than
that
then
again
they
both
shine
in
their
different
ways
if
you
enjoy
pale
ales
this
is
definitely
one
that
you
should
try
o
very
fresh
with
a
unique
hop
profile
a
beer
for
hopheads
crack
a
can
and
chill
o
well
done
pale
ale
taste
is
great
and
easy
enough
to
drink
all
day
kudos
to
half
acre
quality
brew
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
recently
great
stuff
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
or
so
of
white
head
moderate
retention
and
lacing
aroma
was
pretty
light
scents
of
pale
malts
grass
and
floral
hops
biscuity
taste
grainy
balanced
well
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
pretty
basic
and
pretty
typical
of
the
style
lightmedium
mouthfeel
pretty
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
overall
drinkable
is
an
understatement
daisy
cutter
is
excellently
balanced
and
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
it
has
tons
of
aroma
but
a
mellow
flavor
every
apa
should
be
like
this
this
is
top
tier
for
the
style
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
well
liked
but
its
not
quite
my
ideal
hop
profile
though
im
glad
that
my
buddy
brought
2
for
me
when
he
came
back
to
visit
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
ever
to
be
quite
honest
this
is
almost
to
the
point
of
an
ipa
in
terms
of
the
hop
character
but
it
was
great
no
matter
what
you
call
it
i
am
always
impressed
when
a
brewery
can
pack
this
much
flavor
into
a
sessionable
beer
and
always
bonus
points
for
being
in
a
16
oz
can
o
a
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
everything
is
balanced
nicely
and
is
quite
refreshing
actually
o
this
was
surprisingly
not
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
loved
it
out
of
the
can
probably
wouldnt
pay
for
this
again
o
a
great
beer
walks
the
line
between
pale
ale
and
ipa
very
well
im
definitely
a
big
fan
o
its
a
good
pale
its
not
my
usual
style
but
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
so
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
i
figured
id
try
it
wouldnt
order
it
again
but
if
you
like
pales
or
just
arent
a
hop
head
go
for
it
that
said
get
zombie
dust
if
you
can
because
its
in
a
different
league
of
apas
o
one
of
my
favorite
ipa
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
try
it
truly
is
my
go
to
ipa
and
lucky
enough
enough
to
be
local
that
it
ca
be
would
def
recommend
it
overall
a
solid
apa
probably
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
daisy
cutter
can
stand
up
to
a
lot
ipas
out
there
and
its
something
id
like
to
have
on
tap
next
time
im
in
the
windy
city
pours
an
attractive
amber
color
with
good
cap
of
white
froth
decent
lacing
scent
contains
strong
floral
notes
along
with
solid
grapefruit
splashes
of
pine
and
tropical
fruits
and
a
faint
hints
of
sweet
malt
ive
had
dipas
that
have
a
weaker
nose
taste
continues
with
the
strong
hop
presence
grapefruity
and
floral
hops
the
star
splashes
of
other
citrus
light
tropical
fruits
and
a
malt
base
that
is
firm
enough
to
let
itself
be
known
without
being
too
powerful
medium
bodied
lightly
dry
finish
fantastic
pale
ale
that
is
a
class
leader
and
more
potent
in
scent
and
taste
than
many
ipas
p
s
it
smells
so
good
smell
it
just
smell
it
mmm
that
was
nice
right
all
in
all
a
good
beer
i
just
wish
i
could
remember
the
name
of
the
place
i
bought
it
overall
alright
but
there
are
a
couple
dozen
ipas
id
rather
have
on
tap
the
hint
of
citric
apple
was
quite
interesting
but
in
the
end
it
wasnt
enough
to
wow
me
perhaps
the
keg
wasnt
the
freshest
id
like
to
give
this
one
another
go
in
the
future
45
moutfeel
is
nice
for
the
style
and
plenty
thick
carbonation
is
great
overall
a
great
beer
and
im
really
happy
i
got
to
try
this
o
a
solid
ipa
from
half
acre
that
ranks
up
there
with
surly
and
the
floyds
as
some
of
the
best
ipas
in
the
midwest
and
country
definitely
an
easy
drinker
with
a
ton
of
flavor
verdict
really
solid
pale
ale
great
for
almost
any
scenario
wonderful
aroma
nice
flavors
one
ive
been
known
to
enjoy
many
of
in
a
singe
night
gfunk
o
its
a
very
solid
pale
ale
and
one
id
seek
out
again
if
it
was
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
really
enjoyed
this
a
nice
change
up
for
me
as
i
drink
a
lot
of
huma
lupa
licious
and
other
ipas
i
see
this
as
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
not
too
heavy
but
full
of
flavor
very
easy
going
and
very
drinkable
we
have
a
winner
this
is
an
american
pale
ale
it
looks
unbelievable
for
the
style
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
massive
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
wow
the
nose
is
hops
citrus
grapefruit
orange
and
a
little
pine
really
pleasant
the
taste
is
like
an
ipa
the
only
way
i
can
tell
its
not
is
the
pale
malt
flavor
great
bitterness
flavor
etc
i
just
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
this
is
an
apa
feel
is
medium
with
excellent
carbonation
bitterness
and
a
nice
dry
finish
the
malt
sees
action
in
the
feel
too
but
in
the
background
overall
i
could
sit
and
drink
several
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
it
fantastic
example
of
the
style
maybe
the
best
ive
had
highly
recommended
cheers
pours
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
half
finger
of
snow
white
head
pretty
good
retention
and
nice
swaths
of
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
lots
of
tropical
fruit
mango
orange
and
biscuity
malt
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
though
they
dont
pack
as
much
punch
in
the
taste
unfortunately
taste
is
more
biscuity
pale
malt
and
some
clean
nonbitter
orange
flavor
with
very
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
mediumlight
carbonation
and
body
pretty
smooth
overall
really
drinkable
and
tasty
only
complaint
is
that
id
like
to
see
a
little
more
hop
flavor
i
will
drink
this
again
when
the
weather
dictates
o
an
amazing
amount
of
flavor
packed
into
a
fairly
low
abv
probably
the
best
apa
out
there
fantastic
balance
and
a
hoplovers
dream
also
kudos
for
the
can
definitely
kept
the
hop
profile
as
fresh
as
possible
if
possible
acquire
as
much
of
this
as
you
can
overall
a
full
flavored
pale
ale
at
5
2
yes
please
great
beer
here
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
again
during
the
warmer
months
oa
refreshing
pale
ale
for
drinking
on
a
nice
summer
day
i
for
one
hope
daisy
cutter
is
available
in
cases
when
the
summertime
approachessorry
chicago
burbs
philly
should
come
first
so
i
can
buy
a
whole
lot
of
it
this
is
a
all
day
type
of
beer
that
i
could
drink
in
mounds
o
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
that
packs
in
a
lot
of
hop
flavors
for
5
2
i
would
like
a
little
more
complexity
but
its
still
quite
good
o
a
real
nice
pale
ale
in
fact
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
were
around
more
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
belongs
with
the
best
of
them
nice
beer
and
welcome
to
pa
the
only
real
issue
that
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
the
bitterness
is
far
too
assertive
for
the
delicate
hop
flavors
that
come
through
in
the
aroma
they
are
drowned
out
overall
this
is
a
very
good
take
on
a
pale
ale
but
it
could
stand
to
improve
a
bit
yet
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
apa
at
5
2
abv
it
still
packs
a
big
flavor
wallop
tastes
like
it
smells
upfront
but
things
gets
a
little
watery
and
thin
near
the
back
end
the
malt
is
nice
and
sweet
biscuity
and
grassy
and
the
hop
profile
is
a
nice
midwestern
blend
of
citrus
and
fruit
but
like
i
said
the
back
end
is
a
little
thin
outstanding
flavour
and
in
a
can
great
bitterness
very
lacey
floral
yes
it
smells
like
a
flower
store
in
the
background
ultimate
beer
after
a
large
amount
of
taking
care
of
the
garden
thanks
tom
smooth
i
would
drink
this
regularly
and
convert
others
to
the
charms
of
craft
beer
o
because
its
an
apa
im
giving
the
daisy
cutter
the
bump
up
here
there
are
better
examples
zombie
dust
dc
brau
public
troegs
perpetual
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
daisy
cutter
isnt
a
fine
entry
an
enjoyable
apa
with
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
a
very
flavorful
beer
especially
when
considering
that
it
is
only
5
2
strongly
dry
hopped
a
fantastic
session
beer
that
would
go
great
with
seafood
very
nice
o
i
found
this
pretty
refreshing
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
on
a
cold
winter
day
in
wisconsin
having
said
that
the
fairly
low
abv
and
refreshing
qualities
would
make
it
a
pretty
easy
drinker
while
hitting
the
links
in
the
summer
this
was
pretty
good
overall
this
is
and
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
i
always
get
some
when
im
near
chicago
had
this
again
today
to
make
sure
something
wasnt
wrong
with
my
palate
its
just
not
a
great
beer
flavor
profile
is
flat
and
singular
without
much
attempt
at
balance
or
a
journey
of
flavors
along
the
palate
pours
a
hint
darker
than
straw
yellow
with
a
1
5
finger
head
that
laces
well
a
really
enjoyable
nose
with
light
fruity
and
citrus
hop
aromas
with
malty
biscuit
and
sweet
bread
notes
underneath
it
all
the
body
of
the
beer
has
an
enjoyable
light
fruity
happiness
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
that
builds
over
time
earthy
notes
play
through
later
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
and
watery
at
first
the
only
downfall
of
this
beer
really
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
i
am
glad
i
got
two
of
worth
seeking
out
as
an
easy
drinker
as
always
a
great
pale
ale
brings
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
really
good
feel
too
overall
mighty
fine
pale
ale
from
good
ole
chitown
overall
an
exceptional
easy
drinking
apa
daisy
cutter
is
a
great
go
to
beer
that
i
ought
to
always
have
in
my
beer
fridge
it
satiates
ones
hop
fix
quite
well
im
also
glad
that
half
acre
decided
to
use
16
oz
cans
seems
appropriate
for
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
resinous
hop
oils
and
a
blast
of
bitter
earthy
pine
needle
flavor
up
front
that
is
countered
by
the
sweet
citrus
and
pale
malt
notes
slightly
spicy
with
some
earthy
grass
followed
by
hints
of
pineapple
orange
and
grapefruit
before
being
rounded
out
by
the
biscuity
malt
character
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
o
for
a
pale
ale
this
packs
a
punch
i
know
from
experience
this
is
a
sessionable
ale
but
can
also
leave
your
tongue
a
dry
mess
if
youre
in
chicago
you
cant
pass
up
a
daisy
cutter
o
very
very
nice
drinkable
beer
if
this
was
closer
to
me
it
might
just
beat
out
mirror
pond
as
my
go
to
summer
bbq
beverage
love
it
trying
the
half
acre
daisy
cutter
pale
ale
i
have
read
reviews
and
comments
that
declare
this
beer
to
be
as
good
if
not
better
than
zombie
dust
by
3floyds
i
say
not
even
close
however
this
is
a
tasty
beer
the
beer
pours
yellowish
copper
with
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
slightly
the
smell
includes
grapfruit
and
clove
with
waffes
of
pine
the
taste
is
bitter
slight
floral
notes
to
start
followed
by
a
grapfruity
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
lighter
in
body
minumal
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
no
where
near
the
z
dust
worth
a
try
o
i
love
this
beer
its
great
ontap
and
great
from
a
can
apa
ipa
whatever
this
thing
is
its
delicious
i
would
drink
this
one
again
and
again
cheers
to
matt
for
sharing
have
been
enjoying
this
beer
since
i
have
been
in
chicago
great
go
to
ipa
apa
whatever
they
are
calling
it
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
which
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
i
usually
get
more
lacing
out
of
this
beer
aroma
is
big
piney
citrusy
grapefruit
very
clean
crisp
and
light
flavors
are
spot
on
grapefruit
up
front
good
clean
piney
bitterness
but
not
overly
bitter
there
is
a
bit
of
balance
from
the
malt
but
really
this
one
is
a
great
hoppy
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
but
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
enjoyable
available
beer
ill
definitely
miss
it
when
i
no
longer
live
in
chicago
overall
really
enjoyed
the
citrus
and
hops
almost
just
like
an
ipa
good
brew
cheers
overall
its
damn
near
an
ipa
but
just
light
enough
to
still
hold
its
own
as
an
apa
maybe
a
shift
from
bittering
to
aromatics
would
do
this
well
but
its
a
hell
of
a
beer
anyway
16oz
can
thanks
to
spdkilz
appreciate
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
yellow
spotty
swiss
cheese
head
smells
a
little
bit
hoppy
but
not
much
else
taste
is
hops
but
feels
like
it
might
be
a
little
over
the
hill
not
bad
at
all
just
feels
a
bit
faded
the
low
abv
and
light
body
make
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
id
like
to
revisit
this
again
with
a
known
fresh
sample
to
see
how
it
fares
overall
just
a
ton
of
flavor
here
for
a
5
2
apa
not
just
a
hoppy
apa
this
beer
has
some
unique
elements
that
make
it
well
worth
seeking
out
16
oz
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
short
lived
head
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
a
ring
or
lacing
aroma
is
mild
tropical
fruit
with
some
grain
flavor
is
mild
mild
mild
with
subtle
grains
some
fruitiness
and
very
little
bitterness
low
carbonation
and
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
summertime
lawn
mower
golf
day
type
of
beer
when
youd
like
to
throw
back
a
few
without
getting
too
buzzed
overall
this
is
a
tasty
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
style
thats
loaded
with
hop
character
massively
drinkable
and
it
looks
great
in
the
glass
too
despite
all
this
tastes
alot
bigger
than
the
abv
suggest
one
of
my
favorites
thanks
to
the
half
acre
cycling
team
for
sharing
this
beer
this
beer
vanishes
in
my
presence
very
quickly
bought
a
4
pack
of
pint
cans
good
stuff
considering
my
past
experience
of
canned
beer
cheap
this
beer
really
stands
out
love
the
name
and
the
taste
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
brand
even
if
its
9
a
4
pack
beautiful
lacing
full
mouthful
smooth
for
pa
a
very
nice
pale
ale
here
maybe
not
alpha
king
or
fresh
hop
pale
ale
awesome
but
very
good
nonetheless
do
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
reputation
showing
heaps
of
floral
qualities
it
proves
to
be
palatefriendly
although
the
understated
malt
bill
doesnt
promise
to
stand
up
to
much
in
the
way
of
food
in
the
final
tally
this
beer
might
be
more
rightfully
categorized
as
an
americanhopped
blond
ale
than
an
american
pale
ale
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
pale
ale
im
liking
that
its
5
2
and
sold
in
16
oz
cans
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
it
would
probably
be
my
go
to
session
beer
the
smell
was
really
great
but
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
fell
a
bit
short
of
my
expectations
still
some
very
good
stuff
a
pretty
solid
apa
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
beer
spread
farther
out
of
chicago
its
beers
like
this
that
make
the
pale
ale
style
grow
on
me
in
the
past
i
was
never
happy
with
the
ones
ive
tried
since
they
never
seemed
to
strike
any
balance
with
the
hops
and
malt
daisy
cutter
break
the
mold
delivers
wonderful
hop
flavors
reminding
you
its
not
an
ipa
but
enough
to
give
it
that
kick
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
pale
ale
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
like
to
have
a
nice
3
or
4
beer
session
with
this
beer
d
very
comparable
to
fff
alpha
king
i
dont
love
it
but
its
respectable
and
i
enjoy
that
its
a
true
local
brew
o
in
your
face
hops
and
a
decent
base
make
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
the
other
week
and
i
think
it
was
even
better
then
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
random
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
tropical
fruits
grapefruit
juice
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
malt
grapefruittropical
fruits
and
some
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
this
beer
is
on
the
border
between
apa
and
ipa
it
is
very
hoppy
in
flavour
and
aroma
but
not
very
bitter
o
this
beer
skirts
that
apaipa
boundary
as
many
apa
contemporary
examples
do
these
days
and
it
skirts
the
boundary
well
overall
impression
very
awesome
apa
the
malts
compliment
the
hops
perfectly
and
has
a
great
amount
of
body
to
the
brew
i
will
be
looking
for
more
from
half
acre
when
im
up
north
this
coming
month
you
will
have
to
try
this
one
for
yourself
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
white
1
finger
head
smell
is
huge
with
this
lots
of
fruits
with
hints
of
caramel
hops
and
floral
notes
really
good
smelling
beer
fruits
and
hops
also
make
up
the
taste
some
floral
notes
as
well
taste
is
amazing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
taste
is
so
delicious
if
only
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
o
what
i
would
expect
from
this
great
brewery
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
definitely
a
treat
any
time
of
year
but
makes
me
picture
a
fresh
summer
afternoon
if
you
live
close
enough
for
daisy
cutter
to
be
your
goto
session
hop
fix
you
are
a
lucky
individual
overall
one
of
the
drier
apas
ive
had
but
still
very
well
done
gotta
appreciate
an
welldone
brew
in
a
can
i
do
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
maltiness
even
in
an
apa
but
still
recommend
this
one
overall
an
outstanding
pale
ale
that
hop
heads
can
rejoice
over
o
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
just
really
didnt
bring
the
hops
like
i
think
it
should
all
in
all
an
easy
drinking
apa
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
3
5
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
its
very
drinkable
and
quite
flavorful
it
just
needs
more
body
to
be
excellent
d
i
really
like
this
beer
the
smooth
malt
notes
blend
well
with
the
floral
hops
used
in
this
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
perhaps
my
favorite
apa
so
far
i
live
in
chicago
south
suburbs
and
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
overall
pretty
nice
beer
from
half
acres
incredibly
drinkable
highly
recommended
i
recommend
this
highly
it
is
one
of
the
best
pales
available
for
sure
overall
great
summer
beer
glad
i
can
get
this
whenever
i
want
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
my
favorite
apa
the
only
major
drawbacks
are
the
color
and
clarity
but
the
head
and
lacing
more
than
make
up
for
it
a
great
pale
ale
this
is
as
hoppy
as
some
midwest
ipas
and
dipas
a
remarkable
pale
i
cant
wait
to
get
home
and
crack
my
last
can
of
this
o
to
be
honest
the
flavor
profilemalt
profile
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
hopped
up
lager
albeit
not
that
clean
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
the
hop
flavor
didnt
completely
transfer
over
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
in
both
depth
and
intensity
except
for
bitterness
still
pretty
good
but
almost
seems
way
too
bitter
and
hoppy
to
be
considered
an
apa
and
not
an
ipa
odreceived
this
from
a
cool
dude
along
with
a
gumballhead
i
loved
them
both
how
can
i
choose
a
favorite
between
the
two
this
beer
is
great
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
available
to
me
just
a
great
beer
and
i
love
it
in
the
16
oz
cans
o
this
is
a
super
drinkable
beer
that
id
like
to
try
again
i
find
myself
sipping
it
a
bit
faster
than
i
probably
should
the
smells
and
flavors
in
this
beer
are
really
nice
and
like
i
said
before
there
is
something
oddly
familiar
with
this
beer
almost
nostalgic
but
i
cant
seem
to
place
it
nice
work
half
acre
o
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
daisy
cutter
this
time
to
chicago
the
topshelf
aroma
and
smooth
balanced
caramel
maltiness
and
west
coast
hoppiness
with
a
healthy
bit
of
herbal
flavor
make
it
a
superb
example
of
the
style
if
they
moved
the
carbonation
down
a
notch
or
two
to
make
it
a
bit
more
drinkable
this
would
a
top
10
or
20
beer
for
me
o
delightful
beer
you
just
have
to
know
youre
not
getting
yourself
into
a
hoppy
bitter
beer
need
to
try
the
double
now
d
overall
daisy
cutter
isnt
quite
as
nuanced
as
alpha
king
but
its
still
a
masterful
apa
that
delivers
all
of
the
hop
goodness
and
sessionability
that
one
can
expect
from
the
style
a
benchmark
pale
ale
o
this
had
a
great
taste
more
malty
than
your
regular
pale
ale
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
on
draft
was
a
real
treat
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
large
three
finger
head
into
my
ccb
pint
glass
aroma
of
crazy
bold
hops
both
pine
and
citrus
taste
follows
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
malts
to
the
palate
great
allaround
pale
ale
the
boarders
on
ipa
if
i
lived
in
chicago
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
great
brew
received
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
from
an
awesome
ba
in
illinois
ive
already
had
the
galactic
double
daisy
cutter
so
i
was
curious
to
see
how
this
one
would
fare
daisy
cutter
pours
a
translucent
straw
hue
with
a
very
thin
crown
while
theres
little
head
to
speak
of
the
beer
does
leave
behind
some
thin
lacing
as
it
recedes
the
nose
is
really
muted
there
really
isnt
anything
of
note
that
reaches
out
and
punches
you
in
the
face
unlike
the
galactic
variety
the
taste
however
is
marvelous
this
is
a
really
smooth
mellow
mildly
hopped
beer
that
you
could
session
the
daylights
out
of
this
would
definitely
be
one
of
my
go
to
beers
if
i
lived
anywhere
near
half
acre
overall
this
is
a
marvelous
beer
great
tasting
doesnt
scorch
the
taste
buds
smooth
and
next
no
zero
bitterness
on
the
back
end
of
a
sip
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
hasnt
had
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
a
half
acre
beer
this
beer
is
curious
but
not
super
impressive
im
wondering
what
everyone
else
finds
so
amazing
about
it
as
its
not
doing
it
for
me
its
like
half
an
ipa
but
that
ipa
part
is
only
okay
and
the
other
half
is
pretty
bland
some
grapefruit
hops
not
a
whole
lot
else
overall
this
is
everything
an
apa
should
be
hops
and
malts
in
good
measure
with
a
ton
of
character
drinkability
is
incredible
bonus
points
for
rocking
the
tallboy
overall
at
times
the
taste
of
this
beer
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
sixpoint
beers
ive
had
recently
which
are
also
in
16oz
can
format
its
got
a
nice
balance
and
although
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavour
it
still
remains
highly
drinkable
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
this
has
been
my
everyday
beer
for
two
weeks
since
back
home
in
chicago
i
am
going
to
miss
this
greatly
back
in
nyc
where
i
cannot
find
a
sessionable
brew
that
meets
my
hopsintensity
minimums
i
never
find
myself
thinking
this
is
alright
but
man
i
need
a
real
6
5
apv
ipa
this
beer
is
proof
that
a
low
alcohol
beer
can
satisfy
a
strong
ipa
loving
hophead
bravo
half
acre
you
have
created
a
pale
ale
masterpiece
golden
color
very
cheery
slight
haze
fluffy
white
foam
sits
atop
very
rocky
head
lingers
aromas
are
of
light
hop
very
simple
pleasant
flavor
is
very
clean
and
crisp
decent
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
hops
lend
a
citrusy
finish
with
a
dry
light
bitterness
solid
brew
i
can
see
why
everyone
likes
this
one
so
much
overall
my
first
half
acre
beer
and
it
did
not
dissapoint
all
i
have
to
say
is
great
hops
forward
session
beer
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
clean
and
refreshing
pale
awesome
beer
and
a
great
example
of
what
the
style
can
be
o
no
complains
a
very
solid
pale
ale
with
a
low
abv
like
this
i
could
definitely
do
some
damage
to
a
few
of
these
o
a
solid
hopforward
apa
my
kind
of
apa
that
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
decent
amount
of
citrus
flavor
but
only
hints
of
bitterness
great
choice
to
drink
outside
in
the
heat
of
summer
while
not
as
elite
as
alpha
king
i
will
definitely
keep
some
of
these
on
hand
during
the
summer
hope
nothing
but
the
best
for
half
acre
in
the
future
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
if
i
had
access
to
it
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
perfect
summer
beer
and
a
great
beer
overall
always
looking
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
hop
forward
pale
ales
out
there
might
even
classify
this
as
an
ipa
along
similar
lines
with
alpha
king
would
love
it
if
it
was
a
little
more
medium
bodied
but
still
a
solid
brew
overall
a
great
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
try
it
if
you
can
overall
its
a
good
beer
not
worth
the
hype
if
i
had
regular
access
to
it
i
dont
honestly
know
if
it
would
be
something
i
would
buy
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
o
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
out
of
a
can
extremely
refreshing
the
hop
intensity
is
perfect
fantastically
balanced
you
should
definitely
try
this
beer
i
first
had
this
beer
while
visiting
chicago
last
year
and
i
have
been
searching
for
it
ever
since
o
pretty
good
i
liked
how
balanced
this
one
was
it
was
just
a
touch
too
thin
in
the
feel
but
still
a
great
hoppy
pale
ale
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
ontap
some
day
o
very
good
beer
its
not
as
good
as
i
expected
o
this
is
my
definition
of
a
perfect
american
pale
ale
refreshing
as
hell
but
still
enough
hop
character
and
malt
backbone
to
hold
my
interest
i
think
this
knocks
off
alpha
king
for
me
which
i
had
as
an
ipa
in
my
book
anyway
o
this
one
certainly
lives
up
to
its
reputation
and
i
hope
to
grab
lots
more
of
this
stuff
when
i
go
back
to
chicago
to
visit
family
o
an
excellent
apa
ipa
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
amazing
so
crisp
and
wonderful
for
a
hot
summer
day
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
great
balance
and
level
of
bitterness
for
an
apa
certainly
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
on
the
planet
one
of
the
most
easy
drinking
beers
i
have
ever
had
at
only
5
2
it
would
be
a
cinch
to
go
through
several
of
these
i
would
drink
this
regularly
and
year
round
if
i
could
absolutely
terrific
an
expertly
crafted
pale
ale
daisy
cutter
maintains
a
great
balance
between
just
enough
hop
bitterness
and
some
pleasant
fruit
notes
feel
makes
it
really
refreshing
and
inifinitely
drinkable
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
it
had
a
good
deal
of
flavor
with
a
refreshing
dry
clean
finish
perfect
for
a
hot
day
awesome
pale
ale
really
drinkable
wish
this
was
distributed
in
my
area
o
overal
i
really
enjoy
this
pale
ale
ive
had
it
a
few
times
before
theres
only
one
snpa
though
another
favorite
newtome
brewery
thanks
baron
this
beer
is
all
smoke
no
fire
looks
and
smells
great
tastes
like
a
watery
beginners
homebrew
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
pound
on
hot
days
but
not
at
the
price
they
sell
it
for
half
acre
does
make
some
other
pretty
good
beers
but
skip
this
one
if
you
like
you
beer
with
a
hint
of
substance
a
good
pale
ale
hoppy
in
a
distinct
grassyfloral
way
but
still
balanced
o
very
tasty
pale
ale
and
one
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
thanks
to
my
buddy
michael
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
fantastic
american
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
so
far
overall
a
decent
experience
and
the
generosity
of
its
origin
is
appreciated
but
i
wouldnt
run
to
this
again
because
of
the
mysterious
olive
taste
if
this
were
available
in
texas
it
would
be
a
go
to
pale
ale
to
help
fight
the
heat
my
1st
try
at
a
half
acre
beer
but
hopefully
not
my
last
i
was
really
happy
to
get
to
try
this
unexpectedly
aromatic
and
strong
flavored
for
a
pale
ale
definitely
a
sort
of
burntgrain
and
flower
petal
daisys
actually
came
to
mind
perhaps
the
power
of
suggestion
smell
in
the
nose
that
came
off
as
something
earthy
and
savory
with
a
tad
of
floral
like
sweetness
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
but
a
lot
of
concentration
on
a
strong
wheatiness
with
the
nose
playing
a
supporting
role
overall
this
was
very
potent
and
very
interesting
for
a
pale
ale
and
made
me
excited
for
the
prospect
of
double
also
big
props
for
making
such
a
good
outofacan
beer
i
lovw
this
beer
i
cant
say
ive
had
an
american
pale
ale
that
is
as
well
balanced
as
this
its
my
recent
beer
crush
i
am
fortunate
to
be
living
in
chicago
now
and
have
ready
access
to
it
this
weekend
i
will
be
sure
to
introduce
on
on
my
friends
from
cincinnati
to
it
when
he
visits
o
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
all
afternoon
light
and
zesty
with
a
complex
range
of
flavors
yet
simple
to
drink
and
easy
to
enjoy
i
will
probably
start
recommending
this
especially
to
friends
of
mine
who
arent
exactly
craft
beer
drinkers
this
might
be
the
best
example
proving
that
great
beer
can
come
in
a
can
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
i
wont
be
driving
to
chicago
for
it
but
if
i
find
it
in
passing
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
another
pack
of
these
had
one
of
these
over
the
weekend
at
my
friends
house
who
just
got
back
from
il
light
gold
color
not
much
head
some
lacing
the
smell
is
fresh
hops
citrus
gentle
malt
really
alive
and
aggressive
the
taste
is
light
crisp
and
packed
with
juicy
hops
really
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
loved
this
one
doverall
this
is
a
fabulous
apa
i
dont
drink
apas
alot
but
in
the
summer
i
could
see
me
grabing
and
drinking
a
few
of
these
after
mowin
the
lawn
or
take
a
few
of
these
on
a
camping
trip
def
try
this
apa
if
u
get
the
chance
theres
little
wonder
as
to
why
half
acre
has
made
this
their
flagship
beer
they
havent
reinvented
the
wheel
nay
theyve
just
made
the
ride
that
much
smoother
the
mouthfeel
is
satisfyingly
mediumbodied
the
extrasweet
malt
in
this
beer
doesnt
translate
to
a
thick
mouthfeel
half
acre
has
wisely
brewed
this
beer
in
such
a
way
that
it
focuses
on
balance
and
refreshment
overall
this
is
an
above
average
pale
ale
for
some
palates
this
might
score
a
4
0
or
4
5
very
easily
the
malt
profile
here
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
cant
deny
that
the
beer
just
works
overall
i
love
me
some
nice
craft
cans
and
this
does
not
disappoint
i
wish
this
was
distributed
in
my
county
as
i
would
probably
have
it
in
regular
rotation
good
stuff
half
acre
o
great
brew
i
never
thought
id
crave
more
of
a
pale
ale
but
damn
drinking
this
in
the
sun
makes
me
wish
i
had
easy
access
i
would
make
this
a
daily
summer
drinker
were
it
possible
overall
score
is
reflective
of
its
insanely
refreshing
and
satisfying
nature
really
tasty
and
gretare
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
o
have
had
this
many
times
and
is
a
great
local
apa
its
a
good
introduction
for
someone
who
is
not
a
huge
hophead
since
it
has
some
bitter
hop
presence
but
is
well
balanced
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
sharing
this
one
the
other
night
at
his
place
poured
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
light
tan
head
aromas
of
biscuit
hops
and
pine
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
and
drinkable
with
flavors
of
biscuit
hops
and
pine
drinkable
to
a
fault
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
boston
night
while
not
a
game
changer
daisy
cutter
is
a
choice
summer
beer
as
the
temperature
rises
this
week
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
working
my
way
through
these
cans
pretty
quickly
needless
to
say
i
loved
this
one
note
to
other
brewers
out
there
make
more
super
hoppy
apas
ill
drink
all
of
them
yum
very
unique
drinkable
and
moreish
this
poured
a
rich
cloudy
glowing
orange
with
a
strong
2
finger
head
that
is
leaving
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
similar
to
alpha
king
with
hints
of
a
little
zombie
dust
pure
delicious
the
taste
is
a
nice
mellow
citrus
hop
upfront
and
a
nice
lighter
body
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
flavorful
the
whole
way
through
a
good
mellow
consistent
tingle
from
start
to
finish
on
the
sip
overall
its
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
and
i
could
drink
tons
more
if
i
had
it
now
to
find
double
daisy
cutter
o
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
a
bit
more
hops
and
less
maltiness
than
most
really
fresh
and
delicious
this
one
goes
down
so
easy
that
you
could
drink
all
day
this
is
a
pale
ale
that
wants
to
be
an
ipa
o
this
beer
gives
the
impression
that
the
brewers
got
exactly
what
it
wanted
to
get
out
of
it
a
very
well
planned
aromatic
and
balanced
pale
ale
very
aromatic
bold
and
yet
refreshing
o
i
really
enjoy
this
pale
ale
the
hops
along
with
the
lingering
taste
create
a
drinkable
pale
ale
full
of
flavor
as
far
as
a
session
pale
ale
goes
this
is
a
great
choice
nice
hop
character
with
soothing
malt
backbone
not
much
more
i
could
ask
for
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
this
would
be
on
the
grocery
list
each
week
if
i
lived
in
chicago
overall
i
would
say
this
is
probably
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
awesome
juicy
flavors
moderate
level
of
alcohol
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
by
the
growler
if
possible
pours
golden
in
my
snifter
with
a
nice
big
cap
of
white
head
aromatic
citrus
and
maybe
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
dominate
the
nose
a
really
good
smelling
apa
and
definitely
a
notch
above
most
the
taste
is
really
nice
subtle
citrus
and
spicy
grassy
hops
come
out
in
big
fashion
for
an
apa
good
but
drinkable
primarily
citrusflavored
bitterness
malt
way
in
the
back
really
nice
good
light
mouthfeel
with
strong
carbonation
overall
this
is
my
second
favorite
apa
as
of
this
writing
behind
hoppy
birthday
from
alpine
does
not
remind
me
of
most
pale
ales
i
have
had
but
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
buy
freely
i
could
see
a
lot
of
this
being
consumed
on
the
river
good
beer
in
general
overall
its
a
good
pale
ale
and
a
great
one
to
have
on
a
hot
day
o
easy
drinking
onpoint
for
the
style
drink
plain
and
simple
i
want
more
i
am
suprised
this
is
not
higher
rated
it
was
super
tasty
and
good
o
a
good
pale
ale
but
probably
should
be
a
classified
as
an
ipa
perfect
summer
beer
wish
i
had
more
othis
is
the
most
hoppy
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
that
said
it
doesnt
live
up
to
what
i
was
hoping
for
this
is
a
good
not
great
example
of
the
style
no
letdown
here
this
one
is
worthy
of
its
current
high
rating
on
ba
o
nice
light
and
crisp
this
one
is
a
good
way
to
go
when
youre
just
looking
for
either
a
good
way
to
start
the
night
or
a
peaceful
way
to
end
it
it
is
very
mellow
for
sure
and
that
is
what
i
like
most
about
it
it
could
use
a
bit
more
fizz
to
make
it
more
universal
could
really
fit
any
mood
then
but
as
is
it
is
more
of
a
special
time
kinda
beer
a
good
way
to
wind
down
the
especially
stressful
days
o
a
fine
beer
that
i
morn
the
fact
that
i
can
not
get
it
anywhere
but
chicago
drank
it
on
tap
during
my
last
visit
and
brought
several
cans
home
to
relive
the
joy
more
of
an
ipa
than
apa
that
danky
hop
taste
drew
me
in
and
held
me
would
gladly
pay
the
price
if
it
were
to
arrive
locally
by
that
i
mean
philadelphia
d
the
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
the
hop
assault
is
what
i
would
expect
from
an
ipa
rather
than
a
pale
ale
o
while
i
dont
think
this
beer
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
was
quite
good
well
balanced
and
very
mild
perfect
lawnmower
beer
if
it
were
local
id
buy
some
from
time
to
time
but
wont
go
through
the
hassle
of
trading
for
it
o
this
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
i
am
normally
not
too
big
on
ipas
and
dipas
but
this
beer
just
really
opened
my
eyes
to
the
style
and
its
also
the
perfect
lawn
mowing
beer
bought
a
4
pack
this
weekend
when
i
went
to
chicago
pours
a
golden
murky
brownish
orange
small
fluffy
head
with
decent
lacing
smelled
very
citrusy
and
hoppy
out
of
the
can
but
lost
a
bit
of
the
nose
once
it
was
in
the
glass
citrusy
with
nicely
balanced
hops
slightly
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
nice
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonated
after
being
told
by
numerous
people
that
i
had
to
pick
this
up
while
in
chicago
i
just
cant
see
what
all
the
hype
was
about
its
a
nice
pale
ale
but
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
price
or
the
hype
still
a
refreshing
beer
that
i
would
try
on
occasion
if
it
were
available
i
feel
like
i
just
shot
a
blank
and
killed
myself
from
the
blast
o
this
can
was
built
for
the
summer
and
to
date
is
the
best
apa
ive
had
love
it
hazy
strawberry
blonde
with
a
big
soapy
head
of
bone
colored
foam
that
lasts
a
while
and
leaves
scraps
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
dank
smelling
hop
notes
hit
me
in
the
face
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
can
open
citrus
pine
tar
and
grapefruit
rind
come
to
mind
delicious
and
hoppy
with
a
trim
pale
malt
backbone
to
just
balance
medium
bodied
with
scrubbing
carbonation
and
a
hop
oily
finish
daisy
cutter
delivers
in
a
big
way
for
a
session
beer
big
brash
hop
flavor
with
a
sessionable
abv
great
beer
o
at
5
2abv
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
you
can
throw
a
few
back
and
not
sacrifice
on
flavor
if
i
lived
in
the
area
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
pours
a
light
relatively
clear
honey
straw
color
with
a
massive
rocky
foam
off
white
head
thick
clumps
of
lacing
cover
the
glass
and
persist
as
a
cap
throughout
the
beer
aroma
is
heavy
on
pale
and
bready
malts
with
strong
lemon
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
bready
and
biscuit
dominate
the
body
before
a
subtle
lemon
zest
and
rind
hop
flavor
blends
into
the
finish
this
is
quickly
subsumed
by
a
dry
malt
and
grain
takes
over
and
lingers
throughout
the
remainder
creamy
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
bottle
or
can
ive
never
understood
the
love
for
this
beer
pleasant
and
slightly
above
average
but
a
lot
of
locals
do
this
just
as
well
and
this
isnt
remotely
close
to
edward
or
hoppy
birthday
o
this
is
a
quality
apa
definitely
recommended
to
others
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
a
hard
pour
results
in
four
fingers
of
fluffy
white
foam
the
head
recedes
leaving
a
white
coaster
atop
the
hazy
amber
colored
beer
the
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
and
biscuity
malt
smells
great
the
taste
showcases
the
hop
bill
with
notes
of
orange
and
grapefruit
predominating
a
pale
malt
backbone
provides
the
perfect
backdrop
to
the
bitter
hop
forward
character
of
this
apa
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
prickly
level
of
carbonation
which
is
perfect
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
overly
hoppy
pale
ale
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
super
refreshing
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
if
it
was
available
in
socal
recommended
o
man
a
quick
favorite
a
soon
to
be
summertime
staple
what
could
make
a
man
want
to
crack
open
a
beer
at
1130am
this
stuff
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
cant
wait
for
more
taste
does
not
follow
the
aroma
the
taste
is
heavier
on
grass
and
there
is
a
smoky
flavor
too
none
of
the
juiciness
from
the
scent
disappointing
still
good
but
good
because
its
interesting
not
because
its
amazing
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
very
easy
drinking
crisop
and
refreshing
o
i
think
this
is
the
best
american
pale
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
i
could
easily
crush
6
or
7
if
these
in
a
session
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
boarder
line
bw
apa
and
ipa
but
as
i
always
say
this
is
a
line
that
is
meant
to
be
blurred
if
i
could
get
this
in
philly
it
would
be
my
go
to
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
and
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
their
brews
in
my
area
and
will
always
enjoy
them
when
in

cheers
d
i
like
it
its
a
good
tall
boy
to
put
back
that
wont
smash
you
up
too
fierce
like
an
ipa
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
a
burger
or
in
a
hammock
maybe
both
it
definitely
has
a
summer
feeling
to
it
overall
its
a
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
that
i
can
definitely
enjoy
can
in

of

sticks
to
the

nicely

strong
aroma
followed
with
a
citrus
punch
in
the
front
leading
into

followed
by
a
nice
level
of
bitterness
for
a
pale
ale
keeping
it
from
the

level
smooth
not
overly
sharp
carbonation
alittle
thiner
then
most
pales
that
ive
had
overall
a
very
well
balanced
pale
nice
hop
level
wo
pushing
it
in
the
ipa
category
lighter
side
of
medium
body
with
lively
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
earthy
flavor
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
for
me
but
a
good
beer
anyway
this
is
an
incredible
beer
i
usually
drink
this
in
the
pint
cans
but
also
pick
up
a
growler
of
it
now
and
then
the
initial
pour
is
beautiful
from
the
amberorange
rich
color
and
a
full
rich
head
to
the
opaquecloudy
appearance
a
refreshing
citrus
grapefruit
flavor
hits
you
first
a
great
hopness
that
is
also
balanced
with
a
cleancrisp
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
humble
neighborhood
brewery
please
all
heed
my
review
and
find
this
beer
o
well
balanced
and
something
you
can
certainly
have
more
than
one
of
between
this
and
gossamer
i
cant
see
anytime
when
i
couldnt
drink
some
half
acre
love
this
stuff
o
good
great
hops
decent
bitterness
nice
hoppy
finish
decent
malt
balance
and
screw
this
glass
im
finishing
this
out
of
the
can
well
balanced
with
ripe
crisp
carbonation
bready
biscuity
malts
lead
into
a
biting
middle
of
earthy
hops
and
pine
and
then
finishes
with
citrusy
hops
of
grapefruit
lemon
berry
and
sweet
tarts
dry
and
refreshing
not
overly
bitter
but
just
right
great
food
beer
this
is
a
very
solid
apa
and
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
out
of
a
can
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
that
compares
would
be
dales
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
i
also
especially
like
the
16oz
can
format
i
really
wish
this
made
it
out
to
oregon
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
from
the
can
both
are
very
good
i
would
recommend
this
pale
ale
to
all
tap
poured
a
hazy
glowy
orangey
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
and
fresh
grapefruit
notes
with
loads
of
aromatic
notes
is
just
about
perfect
taste
is
also
dominated
by
huge
notes
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
hops
with
a
dry
caramel
malt
base
that
doesnt
overshadow
the
hops
profile
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
one
of
the
best
ipa
that
i
had
the
chance
to
taste
recently
overall
i
gotta
say
this
thing
is
pretty
damn
good
and
will
definintely
make
a
point
to
seek
out
again
declicious
overall
excellent
beer
i
am
definately
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
if
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
live
in
an
area
this
is
distributed
in
i
would
seek
it
out
as
a
go
to
session
beer
well
made
do
thirst
quenching
the
visualaroma
stole
the
show
for
me
on
this
one
after
the
initial
hop
blast
this
pale
ale
seemed
kind
of
bland
would
be
a
good
one
in
the
summer
oloved
it
crisp
and
hoppy
with
a
satisfying
finish
abv
is
low
enough
that
a
second
one
was
an
easy
decision
great
work
by
the
brew
team
at
half
acre
this
is
a
pass
for
sure
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
even
i
dont
see
what
people
see
in
this
beer
based
on
the
smell
youd
think
it
was
a
winner
i
was
foiled
a
16oz
can
poured
into
my
adnams
imperial
tumbler
thanks
to
captinredbeard
for
tossing
this
my
way
appears
a
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
good
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
the
head
has
good
staying
power
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
citrus
fruits
such
as
orange
grapefruit
and
lemon
mildly
resinous
pine
crackers
a
touch
of
floral
perfume
the
malt
certainly
plays
second
fiddle
here
prickly
carbonation
with
a
clean
bitter
finish
a
bit
slick
thanks
again
corey
o
this
is
a
supremely
solid
beer
one
that
i
welcome
at
every
opportunity
o
this
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
if
available
locally
goes
does
easy
and
with
a
lower
abv
you
can
drink
a
few
of
these
and
still
function
daisy
cutter
lived
up
to
the
hype
that
i
had
built
up
for
it
which
i
cant
say
for
some
beers
thank
you
doug
thank
you
adam
for
shipping
me
this
want
i
poured
the
can
into
a
sam
adams
glass
it
gave
off
a
wonderful
big
white
head
that
sat
on
top
of
a
clear
golden
colored
elixir
the
hop
presence
hits
you
first
in
the
nose
you
get
a
ton
of
citrus
and
resin
character
coming
right
at
you
not
much
in
the
way
of
malts
at
all
in
the
taste
it
reminded
me
of
an
ipa
so
i
think
if
you
are
looking
for
a
balanced
brew
this
isnt
for
you
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
i
highly
recommend
it
it
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
so
was
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
to
me
this
would
be
a
great
summer
bbq
brew
if
it
was
local
and
available
that
is
drinkability
superb
brew
i
am
now
kicking
myself
for
not
hauling
back
more
of
it
and
other
half
acre
brews
all
that
trunk
space
wasted
taste
is
light
and
floral
with
earthy
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
a
very
mild
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
of
a
yeast
flavor
like
bread
dough
very
refreshing
but
wouldnt
mind
it
being
a
little
more
bitter
this
one
is
all
about
hop
flavor
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
citrus
hops
in
the
taste
pine
like
hops
and
a
dry
balanced
malt
a
hop
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
pine
hop
in
the
the
aftertaste
big
hops
for
a
pale
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
16oz
can
drinkability
very
complex
bold
flavor
would
complimented
a
meal
of
grilled
meats
well
i
would
consider
this
an
excellent
beer
for
a
cookout
but
only
for
the
beginning
of
the
evening
a
bit
to
bold
for
a
long
session
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
some
lace
on
the
way
down
on
the
nose
there
is
a
huge
grapefruit
note
with
bits
of
pine
resin
underneath
it
im
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
malt
backbone
except
for
a
little
bit
of
bread
in
the
mouth
the
grapefruit
and
resin
are
puckeringly
and
pleasantly
bitter
with
some
dry
bread
coming
in
underneath
the
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
pretty
long
with
the
pine
and
citric
bitterness
sticking
around
for
a
while
this
is
highly
drinkable
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
to
bring
to
parties
and
it
gets
a
little
extra
credit
for
coming
in
an
awesome
form
factor
the
pint
can
so
glad
to
have
discovered
this
now
that
i
wont
be
buying
honkers
for
a
session
brew
anymore
good
work
half
acre
overall
this
is
a
nicely
hopped
pale
ale
that
is
tasty
and
refreshing
at
5
2
abv
it
is
sessionable
and
one
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
drinker
for
a
hot
summer
day
dif
i
could
get
this
in
the
area
it
would
be
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
in
the
spring
and
summer
it
is
very
refreshing
clean
and
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
example
of
how
a
classic
and
relatively
basic
style
can
be
truly
elegant
in
flavor
and
aroma
o
very
nice
pale
ale
reminiscent
of
drifter
andor
moon
man
which
happen
to
be
two
of
my
favorite
apas
i
would
drink
this
as
my
goto
replacement
for
gumballhead
if
i
lived
in
chicago
mouthfeeloverall
the
body
is
very
light
and
it
has
pretty
high
carbonation
not
the
smoothest
drinking
by
any
stretch
and
i
also
think
the
lightness
retracts
from
the
taste
a
bit
as
well
it
drops
off
the
palate
pretty
quickly
this
is
the
biggest
detractor
for
this
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
though
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
its
definitely
hopforward
but
it
also
has
a
malt
presence
as
well
something
id
love
to
have
again
overall
4
5
this
quickly
became
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
after
just
trying
it
a
few
days
ago
i
definitely
would
put
it
in
the
same
class
as
alpha
king
but
maybe
just
behind
it
like
firestone
walker
mission
st
pale
o
i
had
really
high
expectations
for
this
beer
it
didnt
quite
meet
them
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
beers
drinkability
is
probably
its
best
asset
making
it
a
clear
choice
for
session
or
warm
weather
drinking
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
punch
in
the
taste
department
o
solid
pale
ale
nice
bittnerness
that
isnt
over
powering
very
surprised
by
this
brew
o
if
someone
is
specifically
looking
for
a
bitter
hop
kick
this
beer
is
for
them
personally
i
like
hops
but
the
resin
character
in
this
one
would
only
get
me
through
one
glass
and
maybe
not
even
that
harsh
is
an
easy
word
to
apply
here
but
it
doesnt
quite
hit
that
stage
though
it
might
in
a
second
pint
o
well
i
guess
i
have
an
excuse
to
drive
to
chicago
now
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
thats
kept
in
cans
so
i
can
take
it
to
the
beach
certainly
underrated
by
the
rest
of
the
beer
drinking
world
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
5
2
beer
check
this
one
out
if
given
the
opportunity
more
a
sessionable
ipa
than
an
apa
this
gem
defies
easy
categorization
but
is
so
very
worth
seeking
out
if
the
price
point
was
a
little
lower
this
would
never
leave
my
fridge
d
really
solid
pale
ale
reminds
me
a
lot
of
alpha
king
which
is
a
huge
complement
big
american
pale
ale
all
the
way
big
thanks
to
yeahnatenelson
for
sending
this
guy
as
an
extra
next
time
i
head
up
to
chicago
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
immediately
carbonation
is
good
but
mouthfeel
can
seem
a
bit
thin
at
times
for
my
liking
i
could
certainly
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
summer
if
it
were
readily
available
and
a
bit
cheaper
from
what
i
understand
overall
it
is
a
really
good
pale
ale
with
enough
hops
to
keep
me
satisfied
and
coming
back
for
more
at
9
00
a
fourpack
i
would
choose
a
six
pack
of
beer
that
falls
more
squarely
into
the
slot
as
a
pa
or
an
ipa
for
the
same
price
very
sessionable
ale
from
a
local
brewer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
had
never
heard
of
it
so
thanks
again
bay01
for
the
opportunity
to
try
overall
i
felt
this
beer
was
just
teasing
me
i
wanted
more
but
then
this
is
only
an
apa
not
an
ipa
i
can
not
wait
to
try
more
half
acre
beers
overall
a
great
refreshing
hop
forward
pale
ale
if
i
could
find
this
locally
i
would
get
this
beer
regularly
o
hands
down
one
of
the
best
session
beers
on
the
market
i
could
kick
back
with
a
case
of
this
stuff
every
weekend
this
one
drinks
and
feels
like
an
american
ipa
but
earns
its
apa
classification
with
ease
dont
be
shy
in
seeking
half
acres
daisy
cutter
out
its
good
drinking
my
glass
is
empty
and
i
desperately
want
to
open
another
one
nice
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
pale
ale
with
excellent
bitterness
initially
but
finishes
with
only
light
herbal
notes
in
your
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
as
expected
from
a
5
2
abv
beer
would
probably
drink
this
all
the
time
as
this
would
go
well
with
any
meal
or
to
enjoy
several
of
them
as
a
session
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
highly
carbonated
it
still
feels
good
though
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
i
wish
were
locally
available
because
id
be
drinking
it
all
summer
im
not
sure
if
this
is
worth
going
to
great
length
to
get
but
it
sure
is
delicious
the
mouthfeel
isnt
particularly
thick
but
is
just
right
for
the
style
carbonation
is
very
high
adding
a
nice
aspect
to
the
feel
overall
this
was
a
decent
pale
ale
but
ive
had
others
locally
that
are
just
as
good
so
i
probably
wont
make
an
effort
to
find
any
more
of
this
one
but
if
it
were
available
locally
i
could
see
myself
picking
it
up
again
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
but
not
impressive
i
had
pretty
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
found
it
to
be
an
average
representation
of
the
style
an
ok
beer
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
especially
considering
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
with
the
giant
head
i
expected
harsher
carbonation
but
it
works
well
probably
perfect
for
the
can
but
i
prefer
my
pale
ales
with
lighter
carbonation
finishes
quite
dry
almost
reaching
for
water
would
definitely
be
awesome
in
the
summer
and
super
drinkable
edit
782011
had
some
more
of
this
that
is
very
fresh
and
although
i
agree
with
a
lot
of
my
original
review
i
might
bump
it
up
a
bit
in
overall
it
really
is
a
solid
pale
ale
and
worth
seeking
out
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
such
a
great
flavor
profile
for
only
a
5
2
abv
had
5
pints
the
other
night
while
playing
top
golf
and
left
yearning
for
more
d
immensely
drinkable
and
its
good
stuff
id
certainly
have
it
again
d
downed
the
pint
can
with
ease
could
drink
these
all
night
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
relatively
low
abv
delicious
taste
and
just
the
right
bite
i
am
looking
for
this
one
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
pale
ale
with
a
great
hoppy
nose
felt
like
i
could
drink
a
few
cans
of
this
and
gladly
would
glad
to
have
another
can
of
this
and
would
trade
for
more
in
the
future
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
d
this
is
fantastic
i
wish
it
was
available
on
the
east
coast
the
fact
that
its
in
cans
makes
it
that
much
more
awesome
i
want
more
stat
if
i
had
regular
access
to
it
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
the
beach
or
the
golf
course
not
a
high
alcoholic
content
beer
so
its
very
sessionable
the
cpj
md
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
clean
overall
i
like
it
no
knowledge
of
can
date
so
unsure
if
the
muted
flavor
is
from
age
or
not
16oz
can
courtesy
of
jcnd9803
pours
hazy
copper
with
2
finger
offwhite
head
getting
some
aroma
of
spicepepper
cardboard
unripened
melon
and
perhaps
some
lemon
taste
has
some
breadbiscuit
from
the
malt
not
very
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
thin
bodied
and
somewhat
watery
balanced
finish
between
the
bready
malt
and
hop
bitterness
not
a
great
beer
but
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
and
i
think
it
would
grow
on
me
as
the
sesssion
progressed
dvery
drinkable
taste
gone
in
no
time
d
the
drinkability
is
good
because
of
the
wateriness
of
it
overall
this
is
not
that
great
in
comparison
to
may
of
the
other
canned
pale
ales
based
on
the
color
and
alcohol
content
it
should
have
more
flavor
overall
i
really
dont
see
how
could
one
do
a
better
interpretation
of
an
american
pale
ale
at
first
when
smelling
it
i
thought
it
would
be
more
in
the
ipa
ballpark
but
the
really
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
makes
it
a
perfect
summer
brew
very
refreshing
this
was
poured
from
a
16oz
can
it
poured
a
beautiful
and
rich
golden
honey
yellow
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
it
was
moderately
cloudy
it
smelled
of
light
piny
hops
with
a
light
and
honeylike
sweet
malt
backbone
the
flavors
consisted
of
very
clean
piny
hops
and
light
honey
the
balance
is
excellent
it
is
insanely
smooth
and
has
a
superb
mellow
finish
it
draws
you
back
in
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
id
even
say
its
better
than
alpha
king
daisy
cutter
built
me
up
yet
failed
to
knock
me
down
its
refreshing
and
drinkable
enough
just
a
little
disappointing
after
the
crazygood
aroma
and
beautimous
appearance
a
good
session
brew
from
half
acre
pretty
drinkable
most
of
this
was
gone
before
i
noticed
the
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
the
only
thing
that
slow
me
down
edit
in
the
past
few
months
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
have
fallen
in
love
my
favorite
apa
hands
down
the
zesty
bitter
asprinlike
sourness
just
wreck
the
palate
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
the
apa
that
has
killed
the
style
for
me
i
feel
lucky
having
this
so
available
poured
from
a
16oz
can
into
my
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
is
powerful
and
piney
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
totally
lacking
there
is
almost
now
flavor
with
just
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
the
moutfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
only
so
so
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
i
went
into
this
one
with
high
expectations
due
to
the
reputation
that
this
beer
carries
and
was
totally
let
down
its
an
ok
beer
but
if
it
ever
made
its
way
to
ma
i
would
likely
not
by
any
pours
a
hazy
tan
with
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
fresh
floral
and
citrusy
hops
well
balanced
by
sweet
malts
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
here
body
a
bit
thin
decent
finish
of
bitter
hops
nice
pale
ale
good
session
beer
go
get
one
try
it
for
yourself
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
light
bodied
a
very
light
and
springy
beer
that
makes
me
feel
like
im
floating
on
a
flower
bed
the
delicious
hop
finish
is
what
makes
this
beer
really
shine
once
the
glass
was
placed
in
front
of
me
i
was
greeted
to
a
nice
sunny
orange
glowing
cup
of
pale
ale
the
color
looked
very
appealing
to
me
and
being
only
a
block
away
from
the
half
acre
brewery
i
could
only
assume
it
was
pretty
fresh
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
a
treat
on
the
nose
i
could
pick
out
the
piney
hop
goodness
and
some
other
fresh
smelling
tones
it
reminded
me
of
a
crisp
spring
morning
taking
a
drink
of
this
beer
i
could
definitely
taste
the
pine
hops
and
some
other
floral
ingredients
and
boy
did
they
taste
good
it
reminded
me
of
an
ipa
with
a
little
less
bitterness
and
more
of
a
earthy
fresh
crisp
kick
the
mouth
feel
was
also
very
appealing
to
me
it
was
pretty
carbonated
and
felt
good
on
the
palate
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
many
times
my
standard
pour
at
the
local
bar
pours
a
nice
orange
color
but
a
bit
cloudier
than
id
like
for
the
style
aroma
is
great
pine
and
hop
and
citrus
flavor
is
also
outstanding
citrus
comes
through
up
front
and
finishes
dry
and
with
just
the
right
punch
of
bitterness
feels
light
with
a
refreshing
level
carbonation
infinitely
drinkable
as
i
have
certainly
put
down
quite
a
few
in
one
sitting
many
times
great
job
half
acre
half
acre
has
done
it
again
having
tried
about
five
or
six
of
their
brews
this
one
takes
the
cake
its
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
compared
to
some
of
the
hoppier
ipas
out
there
a
very
little
bit
of
sweetness
brings
out
some
of
the
character
of
the
hops
including
a
tropicalcitrus
and
pine
flavor
that
are
perfectly
balanced
with
the
bitterness
this
is
quite
simply
my
ipa
of
choice
had
i
bought
this
in
cans
i
surely
would
have
had
another
but
at
5
a
pop
on
tap
i
had
to
settle
for
just
one
today
i
am
planning
a
brewery
tour
soon
though
so
it
wont
be
long
before
i
get
my
second
helping
of
this
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
poured
a
bright
golden
orange
with
a
couple
fingers
of
dense
head
that
retains
beautifully
great
lacing
as
well
nose
was
unreal
some
tropical
and
floral
notes
coming
out
the
wazoo
mango
sweet
fruits
with
some
lighter
pine
notes
some
citrus
in
there
as
well
great
hops
with
a
sense
of
a
warmer
gentler
sweetness
to
all
of
this
taste
is
right
there
with
the
nose
mango
and
clementine
kick
this
one
off
smooth
with
a
ton
of
tropical
fruits
good
clean
bitterness
and
a
solid
finish
full
mouthfeel
and
a
great
feel
overall
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
makes
me
a
sad
panda
not
having
access
to
this
regularly
up
there
with
alpha
king
in
terms
of
favourite
pale
ales
atmosphere
is
good
nice
hue
and
this
brew
gives
great
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
too
nose
is
full
and
floral
flavor
is
not
complex
but
if
you
like
pales
this
will
do
it
kind
of
a
purist
brew
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
a
very
aromatic
pale
ale
that
i
would
drink
in
warmer
climates
i
doubt
itll
be
available
again
up
here
hence
the
review
great
beer
highly
recommend
drinkability
damn
quaffable
this
is
yes
i
know
its
too
high
abv
my
kind
of
session
beer
extremely
flavorful
not
a
huge
abv
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
could
put
a
couple
pints
of
this
down
no
problem
cant
wait
to
stock
up
on
this
when
i
get
home
this
summer
very
dry
citrus
front
with
bubbly
fresh
pineapples
and
mango
very
high
carbonation
that
scrubs
your
palate
on
every
sip
and
i
am
loving
every
second
of
it
rounding
out
the
middle
there
is
alfalfa
grass
earth
and
soft
bready
notes
which
balance
the
whole
package
in
the
finish
i
am
pulling
out
orange
marmalade
and
no
heat
alcohol
which
makes
this
super
drinkable
and
delicious
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
not
something
i
will
try
and
track
down
again
though
if
it
was
easily
available
to
me
i
would
love
this
tubing
down
the
river
in
the
summer
powerfully
smooth
but
with
toastyhoppy
dryness
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
three
floyds
alpha
king
but
wit
a
crisper
cleaner
body
and
less
sweet
a
respectable
compliment
to
say
the
least
d
outstanding
love
it
very
sad
i
cant
make
it
a
regular
come
to
nyc
guys
i
prefer
my
beers
a
bit
more
assertive
and
this
one
is
just
too
subtle
for
me
love
the
smell
but
let
down
by
the
taste
even
so
i
want
half
acre
to
be
wildly
successful
im
glad
theyre
doing
what
they
do
in
chicago
and
hope
they
keep
doing
it
otherwise
how
would
i
get
my
double
daisy
cutter
yum
d
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
my
palate
tiring
good
balance
for
such
hoppy
goodness
on
tap
at
hunt
club
11411
poured
a
pale
and
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
an
ok
head
aroma
not
really
that
impressive
not
much
to
it
nothing
that
really
stands
out
theres
something
objectionable
on
the
tongue
ive
been
drinking
aclass
exceptionally
balanced
beers
all
night
and
there
is
something
about
this
one
that
offends
oh
im
so
sorry
to
have
a
not
great
review
on
a
local
brand
i
even
rated
it
a
little
bit
higher
for
proximity
to
my
house
sorry
guys
this
is
quaffable
but
just
isnt
that
solid
drinkability
highly
drinkable
a
very
solid
beer
drinkability
very
nice
drinking
beer
that
i
would
definitely
make
a
regular
if
i
was
in
the
distribution
area
d
very
drinkable
nothing
stopping
or
limiting
my
enjoyment
of
this
one
at
all
too
bad
i
cant
buy
it
in
the
northern
suburbs
i
think
it
would
be
my
go
to
beer
highly
drinkable
even
in
an
irish
bar
d
ill
drink
more
of
this
its
not
my
favorite
apa
but
it
is
a
good
beer
oldschool
microbrew
style
here
fresh
and
raw
with
more
than
enough
flavor
to
go
around
surpassing
the
benchmark
this
one
has
great
character
depth
balance
and
flavor
and
one
beer
that
is
completely
and
perfectly
drinkable
overall
a
really
nice
pale
ale
i
wish
was
available
around
here
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
here
yet
it
still
remains
incredibly
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
d
great
one
of
the
more
memorable
pales
ive
had
i
enjoyed
how
soft
and
smooth
the
beer
went
down
while
still
giving
up
the
flavors
which
make
it
so
unique
well
done
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
hops
for
an
apa
and
the
nose
is
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
dont
offer
enough
to
really
set
this
beer
apart
maybe
a
fresh
pint
ontap
turns
things
up
a
notch
or
two
4
0
d
i
really
like
the
hops
but
im
not
a
bit
fan
of
the
yeastiness
i
can
definitely
see
how
so
many
people
like
this
though
definitely
worth
a
drink
to
get
to
the
raw
dank
and
mouthpuckering
hops
tasted
from
a
can
that
i
grabbed
at
the
half
acre
brewery
pours
clear
orange
with
with
a
thick
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
leaving
a
solid
lace
nose
is
aromatic
citrus
hops
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
citrus
is
actually
very
enjoyable
with
fresh
orange
grapefruit
and
lemon
the
beer
is
undoubtedly
bitter
from
the
hops
but
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
along
with
all
of
the
different
citrus
flavors
that
were
also
in
the
nose
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
grapefruit
finish
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
no
i
dont
give
a
flying
monkey
crack
what
the
abv
is
that
id
love
to
have
hanging
around
delighted
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
looking
forward
to
some
more
half
acre
stuff
d
this
is
a
truly
wonderfully
crafted
slightly
unique
bold
and
overall
killer
beer
loads
of
flavor
a
perfect
amount
of
balance
all
in
a
small
package
crisp
refreshing
good
in
summer
or
winter
easily
the
best
apa
ive
had
to
date
one
that
all
others
will
be
judged
against
kudos
to
half
acre
for
this
one
edit
i
see
that
i
seemed
to
have
liked
it
even
better
from
the
can
keeps
those
cans
coming
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
understand
why
it
receives
all
the
attention
not
quite
in
the
top
tier
but
it
doesnt
have
far
to
go
worth
a
shot
wonderful
apa
that
is
easily
drinkable
all
night
wish
this
was
distributed
wider
but
thanks
to
various
trading
partners
to
hook
me
up
delicious
must
try
d
goes
down
very
easy
very
tasty
mild
kick
not
very
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
this
could
possibly
be
my
new
favorite
apa
which
i
of
course
cant
get
here
this
is
a
solid
american
pale
ale
there
is
a
great
showcase
of
assertive
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
perfect
blend
of
flavors
its
not
overly
bitter
and
is
extremely
refreshing
would
love
to
see
this
distributed
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
drinkability
i
did
not
remember
this
being
as
enjoyable
as
it
was
definitely
something
i
will
come
back
to
frequently
so
easy
to
drink
d
really
good
apa
very
crisp
and
very
fresh
easy
to
drink
and
knock
back
a
few
of
these
easily
as
good
if
not
better
than
the
best
aussie
apa
pours
a
hazy
sunset
color
with
a
dense
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
rings
of
dense
foamy
lace
intense
aroma
of
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
that
almost
has
a
smokiness
to
it
that
adds
so
much
to
the
smell
taste
is
consistent
with
the
smell
but
the
smokiness
doesnt
make
an
appearance
until
the
aftertaste
creating
a
very
cool
effect
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
weak
for
my
tastes
and
is
the
only
fault
i
can
find
with
this
brew
ive
been
on
a
bit
of
a
pale
ale
bent
lately
and
was
starting
to
get
sick
of
them
but
daisy
cutter
has
definitely
piqued
my
interest
again
easy
to
drink
but
not
blown
away
by
it
an
a
beer
but
mostly
on
aesthetics
versus
flavor
would
happily
try
it
again
drinkability
very
easy
and
refreshing
not
a
shabby
pale
ale
by
any
standards
were
this
available
in
my
corner
of
the
world
id
probably
have
another
the
only
beer
i
can
think
of
wishing
to
have
on
tap
at
all
times
besides
this
beer
for
regular
drinking
would
be
furious
maybe
pliny
if
i
was
feeling
like
a
higher
abv
d
easy
drinking
5
2
abv
love
this
beer
more
when
im
not
being
critical
of
it
easy
drinking
and
lemongrassy
sure
very
drinkable
and
a
great
apa
wish
this
was
readily
available
as
i
can
see
myself
keeping
this
one
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
very
good
this
low
alcohol
ale
is
packed
with
flavor
and
is
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
a
very
very
strange
animal
not
a
classic
pale
ale
in
the
slightest
i
could
have
done
with
a
toned
down
earthgrass
presence
and
more
citrus
d
high
no
problem
polishing
off
the
16
oz
can
could
have
had
another
overall
i
think
with
a
touch
more
body
this
could
be
an
allstar
beer
would
love
to
try
the
double
daisy
hop
lovers
dream
in
this
can
the
hopheads
lawnmower
beer
truly
a
great
sessioner
its
a
mark
of
american
innovation
i
think
that
a
beer
so
hop
forward
so
beautifully
bitter
can
be
seen
as
a
session
ale
in
the
craft
beer
revolution
we
wont
accept
mediocrity
in
the
session
ale
heres
to
daisy
cutting
drinkability
so
far
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
that
was
made
here
in
chicago
and
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
a
half
acre
beer
great
beer
and
very
refreshing
i
hope
everything
from
half
acre
is
as
good
as
this
or
better
i
want
to
like
this
beer
much
more
than
i
do
it
certainly
has
potential
but
it
just
is
not
exciting
me
while
not
being
exciting
it
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
decent
apa
d
this
isnt
your
normal
pale
ale
big
flavors
but
not
overly
done
i
had
been
hearing
about
this
beer
for
a
while
now
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
overall
an
easy
drinker
good
and
tasty
the
burps
taste
good
too
overall
for
me
this
beer
needs
more
than
just
hops
and
hops
is
all
i
get
from
this
beer
one
can
of
this
beer
is
all
the
bitterness
i
can
handle
tonight
m
good
carbonation
and
body
d
the
citrusy
hop
profile
and
biscuity
malt
character
do
wonders
for
the
drinkability
if
this
wasnt
my
last
daisy
cutter
id
be
having
5
more
after
it
the
lack
of
bitter
and
perfect
carbonation
easily
score
the
55
not
my
favorite
but
id
have
it
again
goes
down
smooth
and
readily
available
in
my
area
also
they
came
in
pints
which
i
wish
all
beers
did
because
bombers
can
be
too
much
and
12
oz
is
never
quite
enough

a
us
palecomes
off
as
a
double
good
solid
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
once
again
a
ton
of
flavor
in
a
5
2
package
yummy
d
i
would
certainly
be
drinking
this
frequently
if
it
were
local
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
id
put
it
right
there
up
against
the
big
boys
of
the
ipa
and
dipa
universe
absolutely
world
class
im
literally
hurt
right
now
that
i
cant
buy
this
locally
changed
my
life
man
get
this
shit
the
dankest
beer
ever
strong
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
up
front
grassy
herbal
citrusy
hops
that
overall
create
a
spicy
gently
numbing
bitterness
light
biscuit
and
fruit
malt
make
a
subdued
showing
but
provide
enough
base
to
make
this
beer
work
hop
flavors
become
more
resinous
in
the
bitter
dry
finish
moderate
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
very
appetizing
and
eminently
drinkable
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
cant
taste
any
alcohol
which
doesnt
really
surprise
me
at
all
with
the
abundance
of
flavor
pretty
easy
to
session
but
its
also
surprisingly
malty
as
well
as
hoppy
so
its
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
a
lot
of
the
west
coast
style
pales
really
an
excellent
beer
though
and
perhaps
the
best
pale
i
have
had
besides
rr
parking
violation
terrific
apa
wish
it
were
available
to
me
here
in
mn
because
this
could
quite
possibly
be
my
replacement
go
to
did
have
another
no
problem
very
drinkable
beer
with
big
flavor
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
light
the
hops
are
not
coating
but
dont
need
to
be
this
is
an
aggressive
hop
bomb
treat
the
beer
disappeared
far
too
fast
a
solid
drinkable
pale
ale
with
balanced
flavor
the
16
oz
cans
are
a
plus
as
well
d
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
and
my
new
benchmark
for
an
apa
worth
seeking
out
you
can
easily
drink
this
beer
in
succession
its
goes
down
smooth
but
its
got
big
flavor
i
was
very
excited
to
get
this
from
bauermc
in
the
hoppy
summer
to
you
bif
i
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
pour
is
hazy
gold
with
a
massive
sticky
3
finger
white
head
lots
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
on
the
nose
it
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
the
citrus
is
perfedtly
balanced
and
it
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
really
lingers
the
beer
has
a
ton
of
flavor
for
a
5
abv
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
poured
into
a
true
pint
glass
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
huge
threefinger
foamy
white
head
with
some
very
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
some
malt
notes
citrus
slight
pine
notes
the
taste
is
hoppy
slightly
sweet
malty
very
nice
citrus
notes
and
some
pines
medium
body
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
apa
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
this
is
also
my
first
from
this
brewery
thanks
chris
drinkability
wow
i
wish
this
as
offered
here
super
smooth
and
a
doable
abv
for
a
couple
if
you
have
this
on
tap
at
your
local
watering
hole
it
must
suck
going
to
bars
without
it
received
a
4
pack
from
darwensi
thanks
man
i
loved
the
dd
cutter
so
i
was
looking
fwd
to
trying
this
pours
a
nice
bright
orange
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
pillow
on
top
leaves
really
nice
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
tropical
fruit
mango
pineapple
and
hint
of
lemon
very
nice
indeed
for
a
pale
ale
taste
is
fairly
hop
forward
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
in
there
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
it
does
seem
a
bit
thin
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
as
it
warms
up
i
guess
that
is
my
only
complaint
highly
drinkable
for
sure
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
while
sitting
on
the
beach
in
cape
may
nj
i
already
asked
darwensi
to
send
me
more
well
done
half
acre
recommended
d
this
is
highly
drinkable
i
could
see
this
as
a
year
round
goto
it
is
just
packed
full
of
hop
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
d
despite
some
of
the
problems
i
have
with
this
beer
i
still
found
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
eh
a
really
thoughtful
extra
and
i
was
stoked
to
receive
it
its
just
not
what
i
expected
overall
by
far
the
best
apa
ive
had
i
would
love
to
drink
this
regularly
hopefully
this
can
doesnt
hurt
as
much
as
its
namesake
bomb
it
pours
a
thoroughly
hazy
light
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
heavy
hoppy
notes
running
the
gamut
from
pine
to
ruby
red
grapefruit
to
even
the
onions
that
made
gubna
a
hardship
for
some
a
slightly
syrupy
caramel
undertow
flows
beneath
the
hoppy
ice
above
the
taste
is
fairly
hoppy
on
its
own
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
smell
behind
this
veil
o
hops
recline
some
light
toffee
light
sweet
caramel
cotton
candy
and
some
slight
florals
the
body
is
fairly
light
though
bordering
on
the
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
finish
tending
toward
the
dry
overall
a
very
solid
apa
but
i
think
it
falls
a
little
short
of
the
hype
presented
to
me
beforehand
still
very
good
but
not
that
good
d
very
good
drinker
a
couple
of
these
would
be
nice
by
a
bonfire
especially
straight
outta
the
can
this
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
golden
orange
color
with
a
puffy
white
finger
off
foam
that
has
some
nice
head
retention
on
it
the
aroma
is
hops
possibly
cascade
i
dont
know
if
i
can
say
anything
else
because
in
all
honesty
it
all
that
i
really
smell
the
hops
do
however
provide
a
delicious
floral
and
citrus
aroma
that
is
unmistakable
the
taste
is
surprisingly
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
had
anticipated
but
there
is
a
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
instead
there
is
a
quite
obvious
earthy
mineral
taste
to
the
beer
which
can
be
tasted
even
more
so
than
the
malts
the
citrus
flavors
of
the
hops
are
palpable
as
well
i
must
be
honest
for
something
that
sounded
so
powerfully
destructive
as
this
its
quite
light
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
there
is
an
overall
herbal
tea
style
taste
to
it
which
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
i
suppose
enhances
the
flavor
of
the
hops
as
well
as
the
aroma
a
quite
enjoyable
pale
ale
this
is
from
someone
who
really
doesnt
like
the
flavor
of
hops
i
must
say
props
to
the
local
stuff
i
wish
i
could
get
this
at
home
in
philadelphia
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
in
about
the
same
range
as
fresh
snpa
but
with
a
slightly
cleaner
finish
yet
another
solid
canned
craft
beer
d
holly
cow
what
an
amazing
apa
once
i
smelled
this
beer
i
thought
i
was
drinking
an
ipa
amazing
amount
of
hops
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
yields
hazy
copperish
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
dwindles
a
bit
into
a
thing
layer
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
hops
with
fruity
tropical
notes
piney
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
hoppier
taste
than
what
i
had
imagined
but
wow
what
a
knock
out
fresh
hops
start
to
finish
with
pale
malts
this
is
great
mouthfeel
is
on
point
but
a
little
heavier
than
i
imagined
the
drinkability
of
this
is
perfect
i
could
drink
this
all
day
provided
by
dirtylou
accompanied
us
on
our
roadtrip
and
then
smuggled
back
to
va
d
this
would
be
a
session
beer
for
me
if
it
were
available
great
everyday
drinker
in
a
can
that
lets
you
take
it
to
more
places
it
is
not
often
you
are
blown
away
by
a
pale
ale
but
more
people
should
be
seeking
this
out
thanks
for
the
trade
guys
nose
nose
nose
such
a
nice
mixed
hoppy
nose
this
is
good
stuff
a
light
resiny
mouthfeel
that
sticks
all
over
the
appearance
is
pretty
average
but
the
taste
is
a
nice
beer
more
hops
in
the
nose
than
the
palate
which
is
a
unique
touch
a
really
nice
effort
d
very
easy
drinker
nice
sweet
flavored
and
not
over
powering
in
the
hops
department
enough
to
make
a
great
first
impression
big
thanks
to
albgarza
for
this
got
a
four
pack
in
a
trade
from
him
so
i
will
be
having
this
brew
again
and
of
course
i
recommend
it
drinkability
is
incredible
great
summer
beer
and
at
5
2
could
drink
these
all
day
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
but
appropriate
overall
this
beer
isnt
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
clean
sessionable
beer
with
subtle
hop
flavor
that
keeps
you
reaching
for
the
glass
then
look
no
further
more
than
half
way
through
my
glass
i
need
to
write
more
and
stop
pausing
constantly
to
take
a
sip
really
a
super
drinkable
beer
as
proclaimed
by
the
steadily
decreasing
level
in
my
glass
it
has
a
medium
feel
with
a
very
modest
level
of
carbonation
that
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
and
well
rounded
overall
there
are
many
pale
ales
indian
included
that
could
take
a
lesson
from
the
hop
character
included
in
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
i
could
have
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
could
drink
this
all
day
definitely
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
had
thanks
to
bauermj
for
this
awesome
extra
16oz
can
into
a
hopus
tulip
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
a
few
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
some
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
just
slightly
overpowering
the
citrus
hop
backbone
very
nice
balance
the
beer
is
very
light
smooth
and
quite
refreshing
with
perfect
carbonation
this
is
an
absolutely
incredible
pale
ale
dare
i
say
the
best
ive
ever
had
if
this
were
available
here
in
nc
it
would
be
a
mainstay
in
my
beer
fridge
for
sure
can
and
tap
have
heard
and
read
good
things
about
this
brew
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
it
bought
a
4
pack
of
it
in
chicago
only
to
find
it
on
tap
at
the
hotel
i
was
staying
at
total
score
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
orangeyellow
color
with
a
tight
little
1
finger
head
the
aroma
that
i
get
is
mostly
of
citrus
hops
and
rind
the
taste
can
easily
be
described
as
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
nice
hops
presence
up
front
that
transitions
to
the
malt
backbone
this
to
me
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
goldenish
pour
with
small
head
good
retention
and
great
lacing
excellent
nose
of
citrusy
and
floral
hop
character
not
super
pungent
but
enough
to
keep
me
interested
good
hop
flavor
malts
in
the
background
to
a
medium
bitterness
with
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
hoppy
for
a
typical
pale
ale
perhaps
but
not
too
overly
hopped
such
that
its
not
approachable
or
too
much
to
pair
with
everyday
food
supremely
drinkable
and
a
great
pale
ale
love
the
pint
cans
i
would
buy
this
buy
the
case
if
i
could
get
it
locally
my
only
complaint
with
this
one
is
that
ryan
didnt
tape
his
growler
up
and
much
of
the
carbonation
has
run
out
of
the
bottle
on
me
i
can
live
with
that
because
even
with
less
carbonation
than
it
should
have
the
beer
still
tastes
amazing
d
this
beer
is
a
great
summer
ale
if
i
lived
closer
to
half
acre
i
would
enjoy
getting
some
cans
of
it
for
a
cubs
game
i
would
imagine
this
tastes
refreshing
from
the
tap
to
the
glass
but
overall
very
enjoyable
thanks
hosp
for
the
can
very
drinkable
an
outstanding
flagship
beer
that
needs
to
make
its
way
to
nc
stat
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
balances
the
taste
of
hops
and
grain
very
well
its
also
light
and
very
refreshing
a
good
summer
beer
thanks
nate
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
now
and
it
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
this
would
definitely
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
in
my
local
store
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
half
acres
other
offerings
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
a
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
its
good
definitely
the
bitterness
in
the
back
is
interesting
and
not
overpowering
but
assertive
and
dominant
there
is
some
graininess
to
it
highly
drinkable
good
hop
flavors
in
the
midpalate
im
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
i
picked
it
up
form
the
fridge
and
it
seems
pretty
fresh
a
good
lighter
beer
that
is
sweet
and
hoppy
enough
to
impress
even
the
strong
ipadipa
lovers
though
10
for
a
4pack
seems
unreasonable
for
this
one
flavors
of
orange
and
grapefruit
floral
hops
and
a
little
dry
crackery
malt
meet
the
tongue
first
with
grapefruit
and
pine
lingering
in
the
finish
only
mildly
bitter
and
fairly
dry
damn
near
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
refreshing
but
extremely
flavorful
i
need
to
track
down
a
few
cans
of
this
overall
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
its
an
unusual
flavor
profile
but
quite
good
this
is
a
great
apa
this
would
probably
be
a
great
ipa
if
it
were
classified
as
one
especially
when
considering
the
relatively
low
abv
very
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
great
body
and
carbonation
make
this
an
overall
wonderful
pale
ale
that
definitely
borders
towards
an
ipa
an
easy
candidate
for
summer
sessions
and
lazy
days
at
the
beach
so
glad
to
have
half
acre
join
the
ranks
of
chicago
brewers
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
it
paired
well
with
my
wild
salmon
burger
d
great
canned
beer
seems
spot
on
for
the
style
wish
this
were
local
id
purchase
it
frequently
cheers
drinkability
is
unreal
so
drinkable
everything
you
could
want
in
a
pale
ale
d
a
solid
pale
ale
with
everything
going
for
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
but
10
for
a
4pk
of
cans
is
a
tad
steep
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
beer
dvery
refreshing
beer
that
drinks
pretty
easily
the
only
thing
i
would
probably
change
about
this
beer
would
be
to
amp
up
the
aroma
hops
a
great
ipa
masquerading
as
a
pale
ale
in
the
west
coast
style
but
not
quite
something
like
alpha
king
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
apa
not
the
biggest
one
out
there
but
i
would
not
want
to
exchange
the
pleasant
flavors
for
more
alcohol
and
thickness
d
very
good
pa
imo
half
acre
just
needs
to
start
distributing
alittle
further
south
great
brewery
with
cool
staff
also
would
like
to
comment
on
there
in
house
soda
tasteing
had
a
cucumber
thyme
and
jalapeno
soda
that
was
oddly
refreshing
d
i
wish
i
had
more
than
two
cans
of
this
this
seems
like
the
best
beer
to
have
after
a
long
day
of
work
which
i
am
doing
now
slightly
muted
golden
translucent
color
body
below
soapy
white
head
that
has
moderate
staying
power
smell
is
very
nice
a
balanced
blend
of
citrus
pine
and
floral
hop
aromas
with
just
a
little
emphasis
on
grapefruit
citrus
at
the
front
end
of
each
sip
is
a
bold
hop
bitterness
followed
by
just
enough
of
a
little
biscuity
malt
for
balance
the
finish
is
crisp
and
bitter
and
leaves
a
trace
of
floral
flavor
behind
to
invite
a
second
sip
body
is
light
and
thin
surprising
for
such
a
flavorful
apa
daisy
cutter
strikes
a
great
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkability
ill
be
keeping
these
around
for
many
a
summer
bbq
while
it
lacked
just
a
bit
of
the
punch
that
the
fresh
growler
i
had
previously
consumed
of
this
had
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
one
of
thee
best
american
pale
ales
out
on
the
market
right
now
growler
can
bottle
anyway
you
it
this
is
just
a
tremendously
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
quaff
fantastic
stuff
body
is
a
bit
thin
which
is
my
only
complaint
low
abv
and
excellent
flavor
make
this
very
drinkable
you
cant
help
but
like
this
beer
everything
feels
like
it
was
done
on
purpose
the
crispness
the
sharpness
were
done
really
well
why
cant
i
get
this
in
indiana
geez
its
not
like
it
wouldnt
sell
dthis
is
a
good
overall
beer
especially
if
you
want
to
sit
back
relax
and
throw
back
a
few
or
more
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
and
more
slick
than
i
would
like
could
stand
a
bit
more
depth
starts
out
a
bit
harsh
on
the
bitterness
scale
but
this
mellows
out
towards
the
end
some
light
peppery
spiciness
present
citrus
notes
noted
not
a
bad
beer
i
expected
more
but
still
great
styling
for
an
apa
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
perfect
for
a
hot
day
in
july
d
excellent
this
is
a
light
super
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
favor
profile
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
but
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
wish
we
could
get
this
around
here
drinkability
overall
this
has
such
a
nice
low
abv
that
it
really
is
a
great
session
style
ipa
i
have
to
get
some
more
of
this
shit
d
this
was
really
good
i
had
heard
about
daisy
cutter
and
it
did
not
disappoint
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
feel
like
some
pale
ales
may
as
well
be
ipas
this
on
the
other
hand
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
just
how
i
think
a
pale
ale
should
be
great
stuff
drinkability
very
nice
huge
flavor
sub6
abv
very
manageable
bitterness
strengths
lie
in
all
the
right
places
and
no
noticeable
weakness
d
well
my
can
is
nearly
gone
and
i
feel
like
i
just
opened
it
not
as
hoppy
as
i
remember
but
very
well
balanced
and
an
all
around
great
beer
something
to
be
sought
out
for
sure
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
tight
head
smell
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
pine
and
nuts
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
fairly
malty
as
well
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
refreshing
and
leaves
me
always
wanting
to
take
a
sip
this
beer
truly
is
great
and
so
has
great
repeat
drinkability
being
only
5
2
light
and
crisp
pours
a
gorgeous
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
is
full
and
fluffy
as
the
head
slowly
diminishes
i
take
a
sniff
im
so
blown
away
by
this
ale
never
had
so
much
hops
hit
my
nostrils
in
a
pale
ale
even
most
ipas
dont
have
such
a
strong
hop
scent
very
impressive
this
smell
is
out
of
this
world
the
taste
is
just
as
amazing
very
strong
hop
presence
with
very
little
malt
characteristics
absolutely
breathtaking
clean
and
crisp
with
lovely
citrus
fruits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
lemon
orange
grapefruit
and
a
tiny
bit
of
melon
this
is
the
most
complex
and
flavorful
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
better
than
a
handful
of
ipas
ive
had
and
ive
had
many
absolutely
amazing
beer
great
job
well
done
libation
very
good
all
around
and
better
canned
than
the
bottled
versions
ive
had
hats
off
to
half
acre
or
taking
the
step
toward
increased
sustainability
and
a
great
way
to
deliver
their
beer
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
lemonyellow
like
raw
honey
nose
was
very
grapefruitcitrusy
mmmm
hops
good
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pronounced
citrus
hops
bite
goddam
the
finish
was
puckeringly
dry
like
i
had
just
bitten
into
a
grapefruit
at
breakfast
man
this
was
pretty
intense
for
being
called
an
american
pale
ale
the
combined
relatively
low
abv
and
intense
flavor
make
it
a
definite
cooler
candidate
if
only
i
could
get
some
more
8
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
fantastic
apa
nice
mix
of
citrus
hops
and
malt
reminds
me
a
bit
of
alpha
king
not
as
hoppy
but
thats
a
good
thing
highly
recommended
poured
hazy
amber
color
with
an
average
frothy
white
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
sour
citrus
hop
aroma
medium
body
with
a
slick
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
bitter
flavor
with
a
medium
bitter
finish
of
moderate
duration
solid
drinkable
brew
to
me
this
blurred
the
lines
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
it
was
a
golden
amber
color
with
good
head
retention
and
excellent
lacing
smell
was
preety
hop
heavy
but
excellent
citusy
hops
are
the
dominant
flavor
and
despite
the
big
hop
profile
the
beer
is
not
overly
bitter
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
great
to
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sticky
but
good
feel
the
flavor
is
of
grapefruit
rind
and
juicy
flesh
with
accompanying
notes
of
pine
and
orange
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
shows
no
real
sign
of
malt
except
for
a
whisper
of
biscuit
character
bitterness
is
at
a
pleasant
moderate
level
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
sticky
and
crisp
carbonation
is
at
an
upper
moderate
level
this
is
a
very
good
hoppy
pale
ale
highly
recommended
excellent
stuff
and
extremely
drinkable
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
drinkable
it
becomes
d
very
smooth
and
refreshing
could
drink
this
one
any
day
would
love
to
have
this
available
down
here
this
beer
would
work
to
have
several
while
watching
a
game
or
on
a
a
patio
while
still
being
interesting
enough
to
sip
for
a
while
this
is
likely
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
very
well
done
and
im
glad
that
this
is
my
first
offering
from
half
acre
this
was
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
expected
it
seemed
a
little
aggressive
for
a
pale
ale
but
was
still
quite
enjoyable
tasted
like
apricot
and
grapefruit
once
i
got
started
this
went
down
pretty
easily
i
would
certainly
order
this
again
d
intresting
pale
ale
but
a
great
offering
from
half
acre
liked
the
beer
all
around
send
me
some
more
peter
dthis
is
quite
a
tasty
and
hoppy
pale
ale
very
nice
drink
and
very
enjoyable
little
thin
in
boddy
but
i
dont
want
to
split
hairs
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
i
wish
this
was
local
to
boston
would
definitely
be
a
staple
for
me
among
my
favorite
pale
ales
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
super
smooth
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
with
some
pretty
cool
character
thanks
alex
d
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
ever
to
be
quite
honest
this
is
almost
to
the
point
of
an
ipa
in
terms
of
the
hop
character
but
it
was
great
no
matter
what
you
call
it
dry
and
hoppy
thats
what
it
has
going
on
very
little
malt
character
just
enough
to
keep
the
beverage
off
the
tea
shelf
hop
flavor
is
nice
good
bitterness
for
an
apa
and
some
prickly
grapefruit
the
hop
enhances
what
sweetness
is
already
there
from
the
malt
bill
its
certainly
unique
although
i
cant
say
i
was
overly
impressed
for
something
that
is
rated
so
high
here
would
give
it
another
shot
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
a
strange
goose
but
a
nice
beer
to
have
after
a
long
run
the
weedy
character
is
weird
but
looking
past
that
its
got
some
great
drinkability
to
it
and
my
glass
doesnt
last
long
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
thanks
again
eric
goes
great
with
food
or
just
a
glass
try
it
a
very
tasty
apa
but
not
hitting
me
as
particularly
vibrant
or
fresh
i
can
tell
there
is
promise
there
and
i
regret
not
getting
a
draught
when
i
had
the
chance
at
the
bottom
lounge
d
almost
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
by
flavor
profile
although
alcohol
level
is
fairly
low
at
5
2
keeping
this
more
in
line
with
the
apa
style
very
full
flavored
beer
tons
of
hops
and
plenty
of
malt
presence
malt
is
not
typical
not
much
in
the
caramelly
flavors
way
more
towards
the
dry
biscuity
malt
flavors
which
serves
this
beer
really
well
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
without
any
complaints
for
a
beer
with
this
much
flavor
especially
hop
flavor
it
is
extremely
easy
drinking
tastes
great
and
the
alcohol
is
on
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
for
craft
beers
a
winning
combination
for
sessionability
d
i
thought
the
grassy
hops
wouldnt
get
to
me
at
first
but
after
a
while
im
wondering
why
this
was
so
acclaimed
its
a
middleoftheroad
pale
ale
thats
not
all
that
impressive
not
something
new
really
and
definitely
not
worth
searching
hard
for
its
still
drinkable
nonetheless
medium
bodied
perfectly
carbonated
soft
plush
texture
this
beer
is
ridiculously
drinkable
as
good
of
a
hoppy
pale
ale
as
ive
ever
tasted
quality
stuff
overall
a
bit
of
a
let
down
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
remember
it
being
much
better
now
i
know
never
buy
this
in
bottle
form
maybe
the
cans
will
translate
better
d
a
drinkable
and
well
balanced
pale
ale
this
beer
has
a
level
of
hop
character
that
nearly
pushes
it
into
the
ipa
category
especially
the
fresh
powdery
hop
aromas
however
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
restrained
bitterness
and
nice
malt
balance
very
good
and
quite
sessionable
by
american
standards
give
me
this
all
night
long
for
a
beer
to
have
this
much
flavor
at
such
a
low
abv
is
amazing
outstanding
apa
and
a
must
try
my
only
regret
is
not
picking
up
more
of
this
as
a
pale
this
beer
has
a
backbone
and
bite
that
often
is
lacking
in
the
breed
this
comes
at
the
expense
of
balance
and
malt
underpinnings
this
is
a
pale
for
hopheads
its
brighter
than
most
ipas
and
lacks
some
of
the
sometimes
cloying
piny
viscosity
of
bigger
ipas
this
is
a
good
thing
as
march
fades
and
the
promise
of
april
and
spring
is
around
the
corner
a
very
nice
summer
beer
d
excellent
hoppy
pinch
and
super
balance
wrapped
inside
a
sessionworthy
strength
pale
ales
arent
usually
something
i
go
to
crazy
over
but
this
is
certainly
a
fine
one
id
really
like
to
have
again
well
played
half
acre
well
played
drinkability
quite
drinkable
the
body
and
the
hop
character
join
forces
to
make
a
beer
thats
very
refreshing
you
can
certainly
have
several
of
these
in
succession
without
a
lineup
change
all
in
all
its
an
exceptional
pale
ale
d
extremely
drinkable
both
in
the
sense
of
flavor
and
abv
an
ipa
drinkers
pale
ale
with
lots
of
hop
bite
i
personally
prefer
more
caramel
malt
for
balance
but
thats
just
me
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
will
drink
again
for
sure
the
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
piney
hops
with
some
other
hop
flavors
the
flavor
is
medium
bitterness
and
some
pine
and
orangecitrus
hops
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
a
great
hoppy
american
pale
ale
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
soft
malt
support
to
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
the
bitterness
just
overpowers
everything
i
think
it
is
still
stuck
in
my
tongue
pours
a
cloudy
rich
honey
color
with
a
good
finger
of
snowy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
sticky
trail
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
smells
a
very
flowery
and
slightly
citrus
hoppy
aroma
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
that
really
improves
as
it
warms
up
which
seems
very
rare
for
the
style
grass
with
a
gently
bitterness
to
it
medium
body
with
a
creamy
yet
easy
bite
to
it
that
is
balanced
well
with
the
carbonation
loved
it
more
and
more
as
it
got
further
into
it
and
could
definitely
see
me
drinking
more
of
these
d
drinkability
is
pretty
high
here
this
is
a
brew
i
could
session
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
brew
its
hitting
the
spot
after
a
long
day
at
work
i
would
really
like
to
have
this
one
on
tap
skal
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
1
beige
head
above
the
clear
golden
amber
brew
pillowy
head
lasts
great
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
green
fresh
hops
taste
starts
with
pale
maltiness
quickly
heads
toward
citrus
in
the
middle
and
closes
moderately
bitter
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
maybe
a
little
gassy
with
good
drinkability
nice
one
that
caught
me
off
guard
d
low
alcohol
great
taste
nothing
overpowering
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
just
a
great
apa
i
dont
know
that
i
have
had
a
better
one
ever
half
acre
making
some
great
beers
for
a
great
city
with
all
of
this
the
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
light
backed
by
the
light
sweetness
i
am
reminded
distinctly
of
moscato
dasti
wine
if
only
for
a
minute
in
the
finish
wonderful
i
would
like
to
see
more
body
though
overall
that
is
one
of
my
only
gripes
here
awesome
d
drinkability
is
superb
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
the
5
2
abv
and
killing
a
bomber
is
no
problem
at
all
its
a
fantastic
goto
session
beer
and
is
totally
worthy
of
the
buzz
that
is
going
around
d
not
as
good
as
a
few
days
old
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
still
damn
tasty
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
find
it
on
tap
on
tap
at
state
and
lake
pours
a
super
hazy
orange
juice
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
great
hoppy
aroma
on
this
one
plenty
of
citrus
namely
orange
lemon
and
grapefruit
with
a
light
herbal
quality
taste
is
fantastic
nice
and
hoppy
bitter
orange
and
grapefruit
come
out
again
semisweet
pale
malts
dry
grassy
finish
medium
body
this
is
a
fantastic
hopped
up
pale
ale
with
low
abv
that
keeps
its
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
bitterness
yum
i
will
be
drinking
several
of
these
over
the
weekend
overall
i
was
surprised
as
i
wasnt
expecing
much
this
is
an
incredible
session
beer
that
will
be
added
to
my
staple
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
its
a
very
good
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
its
nice
to
have
something
so
flavorful
and
only
5
abv
for
a
change
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
side
note
i
wish
half
acre
dated
their
bottles
the
first
bottle
of
daisy
cutter
i
tried
had
an
awful
stale
cardboard
taste
the
only
reason
i
purchased
another
was
because
of
the
great
reviews
it
received
here
pours
a
nice
caramelamber
with
a
very
nice
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
smell
is
loads
of
citrus
with
plenty
of
orange
and
grapefruit
some
pine
in
there
as
well
great
bitterness
to
this
one
and
just
absolutely
outstanding
flavor
for
an
american
pale
alenext
to
columbus
pale
from
town
hall
probably
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
with
absolutely
outstanding
drinkability
man
i
miss
chicago
conclusion
this
apa
is
very
pleasant
on
the
nose
but
is
slightly
less
exciting
on
the
palate
it
represents
the
style
well
with
the
exception
of
an
overly
dry
grip
on
the
tongue
and
a
dry
finish
d
highly
drinkable
and
highly
enjoyable
d
an
extremely
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
next
time
im
home
i
plan
to
go
pick
up
a
growler
from
the
brewery
and
bathe
in
it
d
great
abv
and
very
drinkable
this
would
be
right
up
there
alpha
kings
apa
greatness
conclusion
awesome
when
it
comes
to
beers
brimming
with
hops
usually
im
into
dipas
pliny
hopslam
and
double
crooked
tree
are
my
favs
but
this
is
packed
with
hop
flavor
yet
remains
drinkable
enough
to
have
a
few
in
a
setting
what
a
great
beer
ill
have
to
search
out
more
from
this
brewery
this
is
right
up
there
with
southern
tiers
hop
sun
d
im
sure
the
ontap
version
of
daisy
cutter
is
even
better
than
from
the
bottle
drinkable
to
the
point
that
im
actually
stopping
by
the
brewery
after
work
tomorrow
to
pick
up
more
of
it
d
very
tasty
goes
down
extremely
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
an
entire
evening
d
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
excellent
im
glad
i
now
have
a
growler
from
half
acre
as
i
am
going
to
have
to
get
fills
of
this
from
time
to
time
definitely
worth
checking
out
its
just
a
great
bear
i
want
to
drink
tons
of
it
would
be
great
with
some
chicken
or
turkey
very
drinkable
they
need
to
get
this
stuff
into
sixers
asap
pretty
decent
looking
beer
vibrant
golden
color
and
a
inch
or
so
of
frothy
head
with
ok
retention
citrus
and
floral
hops
hit
the
nose
with
very
faint
malt
presence
strangely
the
taste
doesnt
exactly
follow
the
smell
the
hops
are
more
herbal
and
earthy
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
malt
character
i
can
still
pick
out
some
grapefruit
but
not
to
the
degree
i
found
it
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
i
dont
mind
that
at
all
drinkability
is
a
strong
point
as
it
is
5
2
abv
and
not
at
all
heavebodied
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
and
pair
well
with
seafood
glad
i
tried
this
but
probably
wont
be
back
until
summer
and
ive
worn
myself
out
on
wheat
beers
and
lighter
lagers
overall
i
do
not
how
this
really
could
have
been
improved
on
it
was
just
amazing
straight
forward
hop
bomb
in
a
5
percent
package
just
wow
everything
i
wanted
it
to
be
and
more
i
would
have
this
hooked
up
in
my
house
every
day
seek
it
out
its
up
there
with
any
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
received
this
as
a
christmas
present
from
a
friend
of
mine
who
lives
in
chicago
he
went
to
the
beer
store
and
asked
the
guy
for
some
advice
he
recommended
this
and
said
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
apas
around
i
must
say
that
he
is
absolutley
correct
this
is
a
great
tasting
apa
and
i
am
very
upset
that
i
cant
get
this
where
i
live
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
having
in
all
sorts
of
places
thanks
brian
d
very
much
like
a
little
brother
of
founders
double
trouble
tasty
and
easy
drinking
yu
ummm
good
beer
solid
beer
straightforward
pale
ale
poured
with
a
nice
white
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
earthy
rotting
hay
hoppy
and
enticing
flavors
the
same
but
lots
more
a
tiny
bit
of
citrus
which
for
me
is
passable
very
good
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
pleasant
and
super
easy
to
have
another
swig
session
beer
for
sure
job
well
done
this
is
my
favorite
pale
ale
with
alpha
king
and
this
chicago
has
surprisingly
emerged
as
a
real
destination
for
this
style
goose
island
need
not
try
when
there
are
such
options
now
this
needs
to
get
into
sixers
fast
so
that
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
more
widely
i
will
finish
the
growler
by
the
end
of
the
night
and
not
be
the
slightest
bit
bored
tremendous
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
top
100
worthy
in
my
mind
a
very
sessionable
apa
bomber
not
a
problem
for
a
sunday
afternoon
hope
to
make
this
one
of
my
regulars
i
loved
this
beer
as
it
packs
a
ton
of
hoppy
bitterness
into
a
lightbodied
and
super
drinkable
pale
ale
i
would
stock
my
fridge
with
this
if
i
had
access
outstanding
d
this
is
an
great
everyday
beer
something
you
could
enjoy
from
the
day
until
the
night
16
barrel
from
the
brewery
store
one
day
after
brewing
never
pass
up
daisy
cutter
if
you
find
it
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
at
5
this
is
way
too
easy
to
drink
and
is
becoming
one
of
my
go
to
beers
whenever
i
see
it
on
draft
in
the
city
i
am
expecting
great
things
from
half
acre
going
forward
because
they
have
delivered
an
awesome
pale
ale
the
first
sip
reveals
that
half
acre
is
taking
this
style
as
far
as
it
can
go
before
people
just
start
calling
your
beer
an
ipa
if
you
find
ipas
too
hoppy
this
beer
will
not
provide
you
shelter
vigorous
and
complex
hop
notes
dominate
the
grass
and
pine
launch
the
opening
salvo
on
your
taste
buds
followed
by
grapefruit
and
raw
hop
bitterness
just
when
you
think
that
the
beer
might
fall
into
an
inappropriately
bitter
finish
a
light
lemon
tang
coupled
with
some
biscuity
malt
notes
restores
order
and
balance
with
that
slight
detour
daisy
cutter
actually
manages
a
refreshing
finish
truly
a
worldclass
apa
this
is
a
top
notch
and
very
sessionable
pale
ale
that
ill
be
revisiting
as
frequently
as
possible
the
mouth
is
a
nice
combination
of
silky
oily
the
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
hope
to
see
this
on
tap
at
more
outlets
well
done
guys
my
first
offering
from
half
acre
and
it
didnt
disappoint
im
glad
that
binnys
has
a
bunch
of
these
on
the
shelves
because
ill
certainly
be
going
back
for
more
very
drinkable
pretty
light
lower
abv
lots
of
hops
but
there
will
be
no
problem
putting
down
the
bomber
i
have
thanks
again
to
rudylaw
for
this
beer
hv
2010
standard
growler
no
carbonation
issues
solid
mouthfeel
what
weve
come
to
expect
from
half
acre
a
chicago
classic
d
very
sessionable
and
would
100
recommend
like
the
name
of
the
brew
implies
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
a
hard
day
at
work
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
this
if
it
was
easily
available
another
solid
brew
from
half
acre
looking
forward
to
more
from
them
d
this
is
an
impressive
beer
and
is
the
only
beer
in
the
apa
style
which
i
could
say
could
rival
ak
really
an
amazing
beer
one
which
i
could
easily
drink
all
night
long
the
only
issue
i
have
with
it
is
that
is
not
more
readily
available
drinkability
great
a
perfect
perfect
summer
ale
a
dollar
off
the
price
tag
and
id
make
this
my
go
to
from
june
august
now
to
try
some
on
tap
watch
out
alpha
king
we
have
a
new
crown
in
town
daisy
cutter
is
one
of
my
best
beer
finds
of
the
last
couple
months
and
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
come
across
if
you
run
across
this
on
tap
make
sure
to
grab
two
pints
the
first
will
disappear
before
you
know
it
quite
good
via
16
oz
can
as
well
very
dryish
and
crisp
highly
aromatic
of
us
hops
maybe
the
biggest
hoppiest
nose
on
any
apa
ive
had
im
probably
not
going
to
seek
it
out
again
but
its
definitely
good
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
pint
glass
the
beer
wasa
little
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
2finger
head
that
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
nice
hops
aromas
just
the
way
i
like
american
pale
ales
some
light
citrus
more
orange
than
grapefruit
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
light
and
citrusy
not
inyourface
with
flavors
but
an
easy
drinking
hoppy
quencher
ill
look
for
it
in
bottles
next
time
im
in
chicago
thanks
dave
couldnt
go
wrong
a
golden
orange
with
a
nose
of
straight
pine
sap
and
a
billowing
head
of
a
nice
foam
white
with
lace
palate
is
very
crisp
not
to
much
malt
to
back
it
in
thickness
a
clear
sparkling
beer
grassy
and
well
piney
simple
and
sweet
wonderful
when
fresh
and
i
dont
want
to
say
it
but
i
can
see
where
they
got
the
name
the
hops
are
crisp
and
the
a
bitter
grassy
finish
doesnt
resemble
dandelion
greens
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
from
half
acre
brewing
be
warned
though
it
is
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
which
i
enjoy
the
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
light
bodied
well
carbonated
nothing
overbearing
i
drank
an
entire
bomber
and
really
wanted
more
apa
yea
whatever
i
really
wish
i
could
have
gotten
more
detailed
with
the
review
but
all
i
can
taste
are
freshly
picked
barely
ripe
green
hop
petals
with
a
tangy
lemon
finish
pretty
damned
near
perfect
the
regional
influence
is
definitely
there
as
this
could
easily
be
the
single
ipa
that
three
floyds
never
got
around
to
brewing
think
gumballhead
with
extra
ibus
minus
the
wheat
yea
im
going
to
be
that
annoying
homer
who
gives
his
local
beer
an
a
after
trying
it
only
once
shoot
me
d
awesome
we
first
had
this
on
draft
at
hopleaf
and
we
were
really
taken
with
this
beer
so
far
im
very
impressed
with
the
beer
theyve
been
turning
out
of
their
new
brewery
notes
this
is
the
most
enjoyable
american
pale
ale
that
ive
had
in
a
while
perhaps
due
to
the
freshness
of
the
beer
the
brewery
is
less
than
two
miles
from
the
bar
but
im
wagering
that
its
the
craft
of
the
brewer
im
tasting
ill
probably
grab
another
pint
after
this
and
pick
up
a
six
pack
when
i
see
it
this
is
another
newer
local
brewery
and
i
want
to
see
what
else
they
have
to
offer
in
the
future
good
job
half
acre
i
am
copying
these
notes
over
from
ratebeer
it
does
not
require
as
long
of
review
i
tasted
this
some
time
ago
so
i
cant
add
anything
a
great
pale
ale
i
doubt
this
would
really
make
it
to
may
though
at
least
for
my
preferences
as
it
is
the
fresh
hop
character
that
makes
this
beer
so
interesting
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
this
beer
is
served
below
53f
that
the
hop
character
wouldnt
be
nearly
so
expressive
and
the
light
body
could
come
off
as
being
too
light
sampled
near
60f
though
it
is
quite
nice
especially
once
you
knock
out
the
excess
carbonation
good
solid
apa
id
expect
nothing
less
from
this
brewery
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
with
a
great
blend
of
hops
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
in
my
case
a
great
to
cool
off
with
after
working
on
the
car
most
of
the
afternoon
overall
this
beer
is
solid
not
quite
an
ipa
but
still
having
a
nice
hop
profile
could
be
a
bit
fresher
not
quite
balanced
enough
and
as
i
said
before
seems
a
bit
messy
and
directionless
almost
went
for
too
much
here
but
not
bad
very
drinkable
and
good
for
everyday
drinking
or
with
friends
an
alright
seasonal
rjt
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
very
pleasurable
to
drink
i
dont
think
it
really
brings
anything
new
to
the
plate
that
being
said
i
would
buy
it
again
since
it
is
a
solid
beer
for
a
good
price
drinkability
this
is
definitely
not
as
zesty
or
citrusy
as
i
expected
the
earthy
and
grassy
hops
dominate
which
imparts
a
completely
different
character
though
it
is
fitting
it
is
still
drinkable
and
decent
solid
pale
ale
darker
than
most
examples
of
the
style
tasty
and
drinkable
nonetheless
poured
this
apa
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
pale
amber
color
produced
an
average
white
head
average
retention
and
it
left
an
average
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
baked
bread
citric
lemon
white
pepper
and
pears
medium
bodied
very
smooth
there
was
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
balanced
well
with
white
pepper
herbal
hops
overall
decent

bitterness

ok
good

well
rounded
nice
unusual
apa
oi
really
like
sorachi
ace
hops
the
lemon
flavors
they
impart
if
nice
and
this
a
good
example
the
verdict
good
beer
this
seasonal
is
just
right
for
a
warm
spring
day
especially
after
a
long
hike
well
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
and
between
sweet
and
bitter
overall
pretty
average
beer
not
a
ton
of
flavor
and
slightly
watery
it
get
a
little
more
citric
as
it
warms
dig
is
a
pretty
decent
little
beer
o
pretty
tastey
and
easy
to
drink
but
is
more
like
an
american
amber
than
a
pale
ale
was
looking
forward
to
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
because
i
purchased
a
few
oz
and
wanted
to
see
their
flavor
and
aroma
profile
but
in
this
beer
i
only
detect
hop
bitterness
and
little
else
i
have
no
problem
drinking
this
but
would
rather
buy
a
12
pack
of
alaskan
amber
for
less
money
and
drink
that
pretty
refreshing
really
does
remind
me
of
a
somewhat
lighter
version
of
fat
tire
with
a
bit
more
hops
more
drinkablesessionable
than
fat
tire
in
my
opinion
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
but
pretty
average
to
me
12

lightly
creamy
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel

is
nice

very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
damn
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
hop
flavor
with
good
malt
balance
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
oi
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
brew
the
flavors
are
kind
of
timid
especially
the
hops
which
you
would
think
would
put
on
more
of
a
show
perhaps
i
am
too
spoiled
by
pale
ales
in
the
sierra
nevada
style
but
even
if
new
belgium
was
going
for
the
more
subtle
belgian
style
pale
they
could
have
giving
this
a
little
more
flavor
firepower
more
of
an
amber
than
a
pale
ale
i
thought
that
the
hop
profile
would
be
much
brighter
in
both
aroma
and
taste
underwhelming
spring
offering
bring
back
mighty
arrow
please
oits
a
different
apa
its
not
hoppy
whatsoever
in
fact
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
red
ale
really
or
even
a
red
lager
its
tasty
though
and
super
easy
to
drink
o
solid
and
worth
a
shot
but
i
probably
wont
dig
this
one
again
as
there
are
just
better
options
in
this
class
the
taste
is
sweet
toasted
bread
from
the
malts
and
a
nice
lemony
flavor
that
has
some
nice
bitterness
form
the
hops
i
thought
this
was
a
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
spring
i
could
enjoy
this
on
a
cold
day
or
on
a
warm
day
in
the
sun
perfect
for
spring
although
theres
nothing
special
about
this
one
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
its
a
very
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
apa
overall
not
my
favorite
nb
but
its
really
not
too
bad
its
easy
drinking
and
straightforward
the
sorachi
ace
hop
offers
a
different
spin
on
the
commonplace
pale
ale
everything
in
this
beer
is
really
subtle
and
refined
its
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
its
refreshing
and
clean
id
try
it
again
on
draft
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
do
tend
to
like
my
pale
ales
with
more
fruit
esters
but
if
you
like
the
west
coast
style
hoppy
ipas
but
want
something
lighter
this
will
definitely
fit
the
bill
recommended
not
bad
but
not
really
special
reminds
me
of
a
higher
quality
amber
ale
not
really
all
that
different
from
fat
tire
honestly
low
c
overall
i
bought
this
while
seeking
out
new
and
available
bottled
versions
of
nelson
sauvinhopped
beers
and
i
am
glad
i
did
decent
price
for
a
case
alcohol
shows
through
a
little
more
than
id
like
and
its
lacking
in
hop
flavor
otherwise
its
alright
definitely
not
my
favorite
nb
or
my
favorite
pale
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
for
an
easy
drinking
pale
hoppy
enough
to
meet
your
hop
desires
yet
super
easy
to
drink
definitely
will
visit
this
one
again
o
nice
for
the
style
above
average
but
not
top
of
the
class
pours
a
dark
shiny
copper
orange
with
strong
persistent
hilly
head
lovely
nose
is
mild
some
bitter
notes
some
malt
overall
clean
cold
and
inviting
taste
is
well
balanced
refreshing
well
integrated
malt
notes
bitterness
entering
slightly
later
again
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
quick
and
refreshing
carbonation
assertive
but
not
scrubbing
a
really
nice
pa
id
be
happy
to
drink
at
times
would
be
low
in
the
habit
forming
area
though
a
well
done
pale
ale
enjoyed
seeing
some
different
hop
varieties
used
than
the
standard
offerings
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
not
bad
o
as
far
as
american
pale
ales
go
this
one
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
that
does
bring
a
fairly
unique
flavor
but
not
to
an
overwhelming
level
that
said
this
beer
is
super
drinkable
very
smooth
and
a
solid
choice
for
just
relaxing
socializing
and
enjoying
the
long
overdue
days
of
spring
overall
a
very
nice
summerspring
beer
its
light
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
that
being
said
the
hops
take
a
back
seat
more
than
i
would
like
for
a
pale
ale
cant
complete
with
sessionable
beers
for
drinkability
for
the
time
its
released
in
my
opinion
but
still
one
of
the
better
bottled
pale
ales
for
the
season
pours
a
nice
copper
amber
having
light
head
and
lace
nose
is
soft
with
sweetened
light
cereal
from
the
malt
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
also
light
almost
dulling
the
malt
and
hops
nothing
really
stands
out
a
medium
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
overall
nothing
complex
but
a
fair
brew
that
deserves
a
try
ontap
at
the
brewery
in
fort
collins
i
also
had
it
numerous
times
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
around
colorado
pours
bright
copper
broad
spectrum
of
nice
hop
flavor
earthy
minty
slightly
citric
a
hint
of
melon
and
pine
bready
grainy
malt
with
some
caramel
sweetness
nicely
done
the
hops
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
and
vibrant
but
this
definitely
captures
the
feeling
of
a
spring
day
in
colorado
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
noticeable
but
soft
carbonation
that
creates
a
very
smooth
flowing
mouthfeel
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
be
desirable
i
think
it
would
express
the
hop
combinations
in
the
beer
a
bit
more
which
is
needed
here
o
the
flavor
profiles
in
this
were
not
my
favorite
a
decent
ipa
but
not
one
ill
have
again
o
a
sessionable
amber
with
some
interesting
hop
notes
probably
originating
from
the
sorachi
ace
aroma
has
died
greatly
in
this
dated
but
refrigerated
sample
get
it
fresh
ive
had
this
many
times
from
the
bottle
but
i
finally
had
it
on
tap
at
the
pantry
on
32213
and
it
just
reaffirms
how
much
more
i
like
draft
beer
this
poured
a
deep
amber
color
like
tree
sap
with
almost
no
light
penetration
the
head
was
generous
puffed
up
and
the
color
of
fresh
pizza
dough
leaving
great
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
much
westcoast
hop
resins
and
oily
citrus
fruits
there
was
lots
of
lemon
zing
and
some
grass
notes
as
well
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
made
a
good
show
on
the
palate
it
was
a
good
medium
mouthfeel
with
that
zing
and
crisp
finish
the
taste
was
pretty
sweet
again
like
lemons
and
maybe
some
oranges
with
a
good
strong
bittering
finish
overall
a
very
good
showing
of
a
true
american
pale
nice
choice
for
a
spring
seasonal
ill
probably
get
some
more
before
its
too
late
o
nice
easy
drinking
pale
ale
maybe
a
little
overly
dank
but
i
cant
complain
about
much

a
decent
option
when
looking
for
a
straightforward
pale
ale
that
doesnt
douse
you
in
hops
or
at
least
not
pungent
hops
not
much
in
the
way
of
distinguishing
malt
flavors
a
decent
option
to
have
but
nothing
that
is
going
to
make
me
rush
out
for
a
second
purchase
standard
fare
for
the
most
part
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
this
is
one
of
the
fruitiest
apas
that
i
have
encountered
and
it
doesnt
even
involve
fruit
its
an
interesting
twist
to
the
style
and
i
like
it
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
orange
with
a
light
tan
head
and
some
lace
the
nose
has
some
doughy
bread
very
light
grain
hint
of
peppery
spice
faint
citrus
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
to
a
t
very
doughy
with
a
light
hop
strong
carbonation
and
soft
body
light
and
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
well
balanced
ale

drinkable
cheers
new
belgium
overall
drinkability
i
think
new
belgium
has
something
here
they
need
to
balance
things
out
a
bit
first
served
from
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
globe
poured
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
caramel
and
pine
resin
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
pine
earth
and
earthy
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
this
was
actually
quite
a
surprise
if
i
am
honest
the
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
were
really
quite
well
balanced
and
intense
even
the
earthy
character
on
this
one
tied
in
really
nicely
into
the
rest
of
the
things
going
on
here
quite
refreshing
as
well
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
or
need
a
lawnmower
beer
overall
kind
of
like
a
fat
tire
meets
a
sn
pale
ale
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
english
ipa
than
a
apa
still
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
a
shot
date
on
bottle
03jun12
bottle
to
a
nonic
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
head
dissappears
quickly
aroma
is
faint
light
grass
and
bread
flavor
is
mild
citrus
light
caramel
and
something
sour
that
i
cant
place
but
do
not
like
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
over
carbonated
sorry
to
say
this
beer
will
not
be
bought
again
not
a
very
good
pale
ale
it
not
a
showy
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
any
reason
to
be
its
refreshing
and
balanced
and
remains
a
good
quality
product
i
really
hope
that
this
isnt
a
seasonal
beer
as
its
fantastic
if
it
remains
as
such
ill
be
looking
forward
to
getting
some
around
this
time
of
the
year
not
a
bad
beer
for
summer
days
it
is
refreshing
it
just
lacks
character
in
pretty
much
all
aspects
o
i
am
a
fan
of
these
sorachi
hops
i
like
the
light
lemony
flavor
that
it
brings
to
the
beer
to
over
the
malt
backbone
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
if
not
all
that
interesting
or
different
good
thing
its
only
5
6
because
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
is
a
light
burnt
bronze
color
it
has
medium
carbonation
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
semi
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
but
eventually
thins
out
into
a
fine
layer
of
welcoming
bubbles
theres
some
pretty
good
lacing
too
the
aroma
is
a
bit
bland
but
citrus
fruits
like
lemon
and
mild
grapefruit
come
through
the
malts
are
present
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
its
nice
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
it
really
warms
up
your
mouth
theres
a
slight
alcohol
taste
as
you
swallow
its
slightly
bitter
over
all
and
become
a
little
sweeter
in
the
aftertaste
this
ale
has
a
medium
body
to
it
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
with
good
bitterness
and
nice
hop
profile
nice
to
see
that
nbb
can
do
something
with
hops
that
i
like
overall
the
key
here
is
balance
very
mellow
and
drinkable
insanely
so
nicely
complex
but
not
so
much
that
you
wouldnt
want
a
dozen
of
these
in
your
fridge
at
all
times
nice
drinking
beer
with
tons
of
potential
o
was
not
expecting
very
much
at
ale
from
this
pale
ale
and
so
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
i
really
enjoyed
how
nice
and
sweet
this
pale
ale
was
im
happy
that
new
belgium
didnt
decide
to
join
in
on
the
hop
madness
that
seems
to
be
going
around
and
try
jamming
this
pale
ale
full
of
ibus
like
a
lot
of
the
other
brewerys
are
doing
right
now
with
there
apas
ipas
ans
iipas
that
being
said
though
this
pale
ale
definitely
doesnt
leave
you
particularly
wanting
in
that
category
either
i
really
like
how
unique
this
pale
ale
is
its
definitely
one
worth
remembering
its
mildness
coupled
with
its
low
abv
make
this
beer
incredibly
sessionable
i
could
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
while
doing
some
work
outdoors
while
hop
heads
may
want
to
reach
for
something
a
bit
more
their
style
anyone
who
considers
themselves
an
all
around
beer
lover
should
give
this
beer
a
shot
overall
a
nice
seasonal
effort
by
new
belgium
that
makes
it
standout
just
enough
from
other
breweries
spring
releases
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
great
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
with
a
lemony
spring
zest
flavor
thrown
in
will
probably
pick
up
some
bottles
to
see
how
those
are
drinking
on
tap
at
our
den
iupui
campus
pours
a
nice
decent
midcopper
semigolden
very
bright
with
some
very
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
nice
sweet
scent
bright
and
colorful
in
the
nose
with
a
nice
hit
of
hop
bitterness
hard
to
discern
some
citrus
and
some
floral
but
its
light
nice
flavors
with
a
wonderful
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
easy
bitterness
at
the
end
with
some
slight
citrus
and
slight
floral
goes
down
very
easy
a
smooth
and
light
spring
pale
ale
overall
great
seasonal
glad
i
picked
this
up
overall
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
in
6
words
itd
be
fat
tire
with
a
hop
kick
very
good
beer
maybe
my
new
favorite
from
nb
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
really
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
this
beer
had
great
balance
and
was
very
true
to
style
with
just
enough
hops
for
the
style
it
had
very
good
drinkability
it
went
down
way
faster
then
i
expected
it
was
refreshing
and
crisp
it
wasnt
filling
and
the
flavors
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
would
be
perfectly
fine
with
drinking
a
six
pack
throughout
the
day
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
just
about
everything
with
the
balance
being
one
of
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
fact
that
i
cant
buy
it
in
michigan
if
i
could
it
might
be
one
of
my
go
to
american
pale
ales
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
if
i
was
somewhere
where
new
belgium
was
sold
but
since
they
arent
available
in
michigan
i
doubt
i
will
be
having
it
again
any
time
soon
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
and
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
american
pale
ales
new
belgium
came
though
with
one
damn
good
american
pale
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
just
wish
i
could
buy
it
at
the
store
good
job
guys
you
are
one
solid
brewing
company
and
with
beers
as
good
this
you
can
be
sure
that
i
am
more
than
willing
to
try
more
of
your
different
brews
when
comparing
this
beer
to
their
mighty
arrow
pale
ale
this
beer
comes
out
on
top
in
every
aspect
and
that
makes
dig
a
better
american
pale
ale
this
is
a
good
american
pale
ale
that
could
have
been
improved
with
a
more
aggresive
hop
presence
this
was
not
up
to
par
with
former
spring
offering
mighty
arrow
wow
this
is
a
great
apa
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
foamy
billowy
thick
golden
tan
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
good
lace
color
is
a
very
clear
orange
amber
with
some
nice
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
hop
caramel
earth
spent
grist
a
little
fruit
and
citrus
flavors
much
like
nose
very
well
balanced
with
the
bitter
sweet
and
tang
just
right
body
is
just
right
for
this
beer
a
few
round
high
points
from
hop
and
acid
full
mouth
finish
is
like
flavor
quite
short
and
extremely
satisfying
yet
ready
for
more
very
well
done
overall
a
crisp
fruity
very
refreshing
lighter
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
to
match
the
japaneseusanew
zealand
combination
of
hops
o
an
okay
pale
ale
but
not
balanced
enough
from
the
hop
perspective
drinkable
and
pleasant
but
just
not
quite
enoughh
of
what
i
like
in
my
apa
drink
after
reading
the
hop
additions
on
this
one
i
had
higher
hopes
just
didnt
work
for
me
it
was
a
bit
cold
in
so
cal
today
so
might
have
been
the
wrong
choice
body
is
about
perfect
for
the
style
very
easy
drinking
nice
pale
ale
hmmm
its
pretty
good
i
would
definitely
never
turn
one
of
these
down
though
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
or
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
take
this
review
with
a
tiny
grain
of
salt
it
was
my
first
of
the
night
after
a
long
day
of
hiking
in
zion
national
park
but
this
one
is
good
i
do
like
it
still
an
easy
drinking
warm
weather
beer
but
certainly
not
the
apa
id
recommend
to
friends
doa
d
disappointed
in
this
one
this
should
be
a
nice
bold
hop
combo
but
it
never
appears
smell
is
mild
vague
dried
citrus
peel
and
light
hop
earthiness
light
grains
taste
is
similar
a
thin
flash
of
hop
character
fades
into
a
watery
and
malt
forward
middle
and
an
earthy
aftertaste
body
is
thin
and
somewhat
bland
drinkable
but
not
assertive
at
all
seeing
as
this
was
just
released
for
the
season
it
should
be
fresh
and
therefore
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
cheers
note
having
had
a
6pack
of
these
one
bottle
had
a
bit
of
diacetyl
which
wasnt
really
present
in
the
others
not
sure
how
common
that
is
but
56
were
just
fine
overall
a
refreshing
light
and
easytosession
beer
for
the
warm
months
enjoyable
overall
fairly
decent
brew
remind
me
more
of
an
english
pa
than
an
american
pa
very
mild
on
the
hop
bitterness
and
taste
but
overall
a
very
solid
drinkable
brew
great
medium
body
and
very
smooth
biscuit
malt
underneath
bitter
herbal
and
drying
hops
the
flavor
is
not
mind
blowing
but
it
is
refreshing
and
i
will
have
another
beer
is
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
after
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
the
finish
of
hte
beer
is
solventy
and
strong
the
midpalate
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
and
dry
earthy
it
is
the
finish
that
bothers
me
the
most
could
have
been
really
good
but
this
wont
be
a
repeat
for
me
overall
wasnt
bad
but
id
say
it
was
more
garden
variety
reminded
me
a
little
like
sierra
nevadas
torpedo
ipa
but
with
a
little
less
punch
or
zing
lighter
bodied
an
active
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
watery
more
lawnmower
beer
than
sn
pale
clear
and
golden
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
tulip
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
offering
some
dank
hops
floral
scents
pine
toast
biscuits
a
balanced
flavor
perhaps
a
hit
grainy
and
bready
for
the
style
not
great
but
drinkable
light
bodied
and
suitable
for
a
spring
day
on
the
deck
this
is
a
high
quality
great
tasting
beer
that
can
satisfy
an
ipa
craving
the
hops
are
way
more
fruitier
and
less
piney
than
anything
ive
had
before
i
love
this
beer
o
not
bad
at
all
not
what
i
expected
but
its
a
tart
suprise
definitly
sessionalbe
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
tasted
great
and
looked
great
as
well
i
highly
recommend
it
o
not
a
bad
apa
but
not
stellar
the
fruits
really
come
out
in
the
taste
after
the
beer
warms
considerably
i
like
somersault
much
better
as
far
as
the
new
belgium
seasonals
go
overall
a
brew
with
a
refreshing
citrusy
fruity
taste
and
had
a
really
nice
springtime
feel
to
it
t
nonsweet
savory
very
bitter
cracker
and
barley
flavors
come
out
quite
a
dry
beer
a
bit
too
much
for
my
taste
malt
is
underplayed
new
belgium
dig
pale
ale
new
belgium
has
made
it
big
because
of
fat
tire
fat
tire
is
not
a
bad
brew
my
theory
on
its
success
is
that
is
has
a
catchy
name
these
days
it
takes
more
than
a
good
product
to
hit
it
big
branding
is
key
so
where
did
new
belgium
come
up
with
dig
as
a
name
for
a
beer
it
is
pretty
poor
anyway
dig
despite
poor
branding
is
not
a
bad
effort
from
a
drinkability
standpoint
amber
in
color
thin
but
persistent
head
but
not
much
in
the
aroma
column
get
things
started
smooth
experience
going
down
almost
a
dry
feeling
with
very
little
aftertaste
flavor
is
a
balance
between
malt
and
subtle
hops
from
start
to
finish
one
never
gets
in
from
of
the
other
in
the
end
the
dig
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
no
outstanding
qualities
but
no
shortcomings
other
than
an
odd
name
d
drinkable
and
well
crafted
it
has
a
light
touch
without
being
bland
not
focused
on
the
hops
the
malt
is
the
primary
player
here
but
there
is
enough
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
keep
it
balanced
o
mild
mannered
in
the
glass
its
cordial
without
being
bombastic
oi
am
tempering
this
review
with
3
0
ratings
as
a
benefit
of
the
doubt
perspective
maybe
its
me
i
just
didnt
get
this
beer
and
i
wanted
to
d
very
drinkable
nice
apa
featuring
neslon
hops
good
hop
profile
and
balance
bright
amber
in
the
tall
goblet
excellent
foam
retention
and
lacing
fresh
scent
of
clover
or
alfalfa
im
not
sold
on
this
particular
flavor
combo
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
education
value
modestly
bitter
but
it
creeps
up
in
the
aftertaste
from
the
12
oz
bottle
o
a
very
easy
going
pale
ale
good
for
anyone
and
still
a
world
class
beer
a
clear
golden
orange
in
color
smells
of
freshly
cut
melon
taste
is
predominately
passion
fruit
with
some
caramel
and
citrus
a
bit
of
woody
hops
in
the
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
overal
a
solid
pale
ale
super
fresh
and
worthy
of
the
new
belgium
name

o
i
dont
know
what
to
think
the
diacetylbutterscotch
flavor
is
so
apparent
i
feel
like
it
must
be
some
kind
of
mistake
it
doesnt
really
make
the
beer
any
harder
to
drink
though
and
it
actually
kind
of
works
out
to
be
an
interesting
and
almost
pleasant
character
in
the
beer
but
still
its
distracting
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
foamy
head
mild
scent
of
hops
and
malts
overall
has
a
crisp
and
clean
taste
that
delivers
the
perfect
blend
of
malts
and
hops
some
bready
citrus
tones
mixed
in
with
bitterness
slightly
dry
finish
a
well
made
refreshing
beer
to
get
you
in
the
mood
for
spring
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
nice
but
really
notable
in
any
area
the
body
was
decent
and
smooth
the
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
went
down
quickly
and
easily
overall
a
nice
inoffensive
brew
that
really
doesnt
do
anything
to
make
you
notice
it
worth
a
shot
as
your
spring
chore
beer
it
is
an
easy
drinker
light
refreshing
but
to
me
at
least
not
overly
memorable
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
bright
medium
orange
amber
slight
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
random
bubbles
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
mild
pleasant
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
hops
flavor
is
dry
bisquit
malt
grassy
hops
and
light
citrus
finishes
with
dry
slightly
medicinal
hops
a
bit
dark
colored
for
a
pale
ale
but
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
more
robust
than
an
average
pale
ale
light
bodied
but
appropriate
for
the
style
a
nice
pale
ale
that
leans
towards
an
amber
ale
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hops
hint
of
citrus
cops
slight
earthy
malt
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
overall
well
balanced
between
hop
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
not
a
strong
body
but
it
is
not
weak
either
this
definitely
fits
into
the
new
belgium
lineup
of
brews
tasty
a
nice
little
pale
ale
as
temperatures
rise
and
the
days
grow
longer
o
not
bad
nothing
really
stands
out
aside
from
the
fact
that
is
drinkable
an
refreshing
i
liked
this
offering
its
a
neat
take
on
a
spring
seasonal
for
people
who
get
sick
of
all
the
bocks
and
barleywines
this
was
just
average
at
best
for
me
which
is
saying
something
consider
how
most
of
the
other
new
belgiums
ive
tried
d
its
a
fresh
pale
thats
fairly
easy
drinking
and
definitely
a
good
foundation
though
its
too
simple
with
some
work
it
could
be
a
great
beer
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
fine
representation
of
an
apa
that
beer
drinkers
not
beer
nerds
can
appreciate
o
a
decent
pale
really
not
too
much
to
comment
on
for
me
its
certainly
not
shouting
to
be
noticed
i
have
had
other
beers
with
sorachi
ace
that
had
a
more
noticeable
lemon
character
that
i
would
like
to
see
here
also
the
aroma
is
minimal
some
of
these
issues
could
have
to
do
with
warm
storage
on
the
shelf
andor
age
o
a
very
nicely
balanced
brew
lots
of
grassy
hops
lemon
type
flavors
sweet
malt
and
spice
thumbs
up
jumping
on
the
new
hops
here
some
say
they
take
some
getting
used
though
i
disagree
it
is
like
spicing
your
food
either
some
go
well
together
and
others
you
have
to
be
more
subtle
with
i
understand
what
new
belgium
was
trying
to
accomplish
but
the
hopping
misses
the
mark
for
me
a
little
bit
still
a
decent
quaff
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
apa
grapefruit
and
caramel
notes
take
much
of
the
flavor
but
the
beer
still
feels
fairly
easy
drinking
it
isnt
the
best
apa
i
have
had
but
it
certainly
is
a
nice
brew
o
looks
like
this
is
new
belgiums
new

good

well
made
id
like
to
see
this

quite

middle

pale
ale
glad
i
got
to
try
ontap
o
not
bad
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
o
i
think
this
is
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
that
id
enjoy
any
day
of
the
year
theres
nothing
that
wowed
me
but
its
affordable
drinkable
and
refreshing
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
definitely
worth

before

this
pours
a

with

off

which
leaves
a

the
smell
is
slightly
of
hops
a

most

bready

the
feel

the
taste
is

than
i
was
hoping
the

malts
take
the
centerstage
with
a
mild
esb

bite
its
okay
for
an
english
pale
ale
though
overall
pretty
okay
or
did
i
say
that
already
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
quite
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
as
well
as
some
grass
from
the
hops
and
some
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
pine
and
orange
citrus
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
grass
and
some
biscuit
malt
the
bitterness
is
very
low
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
a
nice
balanced
pale
ale
spring
refreshment
but
with
how
early
in
the
year
it
comes
out
feb
the
extra
malt
layers
are
nice
good
beer
d
wow
this
is
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
great
complexity
however
subtle
from
the
use
of
several
different
hop
varietals
as
far
as
tasty
quaffable
apas
are
concerned
put
this
one
on
your
list
this
is
a
copper
auburn
colored
brew
theres
a
pleasing
hoppy
aroma
with
some
zesty
citrus
notes
and
a
dominant
grassy
smell
flavor
is
big
citrus
mostly
orange
with
some
lemonygrapefruit
notes
with
some
hints
of
soft
peach
followed
by
a
nice
finish
not
much
of
a
malt
profile
to
speak
of
really
but
with
a
brew
this
tasty
and
full
flavored
im
not
going
to
complain
ill
certainly
be
picking
up
more
of
these
overall
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
bitters
in
the
finish
but
not
terribly
disappointed
not
terribly
impressed
either
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
if
offered
id
gladly
take
one
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
too
bad
it
wont
be
around
all
summer
it
is
very
good
d
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
nice
lemon
zest
flavor
and
well
balanced
by
the
malts
feels
a
little
chewy
for
some
reason
but
wetting
to
the
palate
this
is
a
good
outdoorsy
kind
of
beer
this
is
an
odd
apa
the
malt
character
is
off
putting
the
burnt
toast
notes
are
unusual
otherwise
this
is
an
alright
refreshing
beer
i
probably
will
avoid
this
in
the
future
id
call
this
one
of
those
seasonals
you
wish
they
would
make
yearround
but
with
new
belgiums
lineup
as
it
is
this
one
might
not
even
bear
mentioning
good
pickup
this
spring
either
way
new
belgium
brewing
company
is
trying
out
a
new
rotating
seasonal
line
usually
3
years
as
a
seasonal
then
a
new
brew
will
replace
it
this
go
round
mighty
arrow
pale
ale
was
replaced
by
dig
pale
ale
dig
pours
a
light
copper
almost
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
provides
a
lot
of
lacing
a
bouquet
of
hop
aromas
dominate
the
nose
with
whiffs
of
tropical
fruit
grapefruit
and
lemon
all
very
noticeable
very
little
malt
flavors
are
detectable
on
the
pallet
with
the
bolder
notes
going
towards
lemon
orange
and
passion
fruit
hoppiness
before
a
dry
finish
this
medium
carbonation
and
bodied
ale
use
some
newer
hop
strains
sorachi
ace
and
nelson
sauvin
creating
some
new
and
unique
flavors
o
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
that
its
clearly
an
american
pale
with
the
characteristic
cascade
aromas
but
theres
more
complexity
to
it
with
the
other
hop
utilization
its
got
more
bite
than
many
pales
and
could
be
considered
a
wanna
be
ipa
maybe
new
belgium
set
out
to
build
a
complex
ipa
but
settled
with
this
jr
version
and
slapped
on
the
pale
label
or
not
theyre
pros
after
all
finishes
drier
than
some
of
the
easier
drinking
pale
ales
but
i
still
like
it
in
my
opinion
this
beer
will
be
a
good
companion
for
summer
bbqs
o
pretty
good
stuff
this
stuff
is
going
to
replace
my
fat
tire
purchases
while
its
available
overall
somewhat
interesting
in
taste
when
one
considers
whats
hinted
at
on
the
label
the
taste
itself
is
ok
an
odd
blend
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
and
even
still
tanginess
on
the
palate
its
a
step
up
with
what
seems
to
be
a
deliberately
understated
bitterness
with
enough
hop
flavor
to
gently
prod
my
tastebuds
the
chalky
character
is
reduced
and
theres
more
lemon
peach
and
even
some
floral
characteristics
present
bitterness
is
mediumlow
and
the
hop
flavor
is
quite
nice
in
the
mix
sweeter
flavors
with
honey
toast
and
a
little
caramel
are
noticeable
but
arent
prominent
right
now
drying
on
finish
with
a
refreshing
bitterness
this
is
quite
nice
on
the
palate
almost
overcarbonated
this
has
a
mild
carbonic
acid
bite
especially
on
the
finish
while
the
bitterness
is
low
it
does
have
a
nice
snap
to
it
apart
from
that
however
there
isnt
much
i
can
say
in
a
particularly
positive
light
as
this
beer
is
just
bland
decent
id
drink
it
if
offered
but
i
doubt
ill
seek
this
out
again
bottle
poured
into
glass
light
amber
in
appearance
some
head
let
is
warm
up
a
bit
to
open
nose
is
very
peachy
pine
and
some
citrus
taste
is
more
bitter
than
expected
and
stays
with
you
some
lacing
average
pale
ale
not
sure
i
dig
it
well
this
beer
sure
is
interesting
i
love
sorachi
ace
hops
and
i
love
nelson
sauvin
hops
but
the
combination
along
with
a
few
others
leaves
me
scratching
my
head
im
not
sure
that
im
totally
on
board
with
this
one
but
its
intriguing
enough
that
id
be
happy
to
have
another
notes
sorachi
ace
and
nelson
sauvin
hops
this
is
my
first
beer
brewed
with
these
hops
that
i
know
of
i
enjoyed
them
quite
a
bit
nice
new
beer
by
nb
wouldnt
want
to
see
mighty
arrow
replaced
but
this
is
a
unique
pale
ale
that
i
will
look
forward
to
having
again
overall
a
solid
apa
at
a
pretty
good
price
for
a
six
pack
i
always
like
trying
the
new
nb
beers
and
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
yeah
fool
i
did
just
drop
an
obscure
90s
music
reference
thought
you
knew
wait
make
that
three
quite
nice
thumbs
up
indeed
not
sure
i
will
pick
this
up
again
this
season
but
will
look
forward
to
trying
it
when
it
comes
out
again
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
at
a
steady
pace
scent
is
a
nice
blend
or
citrus
and
earthy
hop
aromas
with
a
nice
kick
of
malt
more
citrusy
as
this
beer
warms
taste
is
first
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
then
immediately
i
get
some
lovely
bitter
hop
flavors
lemon
grapefruit
and
pine
as
well
finishes
with
a
smooth
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
im
really
digging
this
seasonal
get
it
not
bad
here
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
as
spring
seasonals
go
this
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
bright
and
citrusy
crisp
and
fresh
exactly
what
youd
want
on
a
spring
afternoon
watching
the
flowers
bloom
medium
body
lively
carbonation
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
a
light
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
lots
of
citrus
aromas
to
this
one
heavy
on
the
lemon
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
juice
some
floral
and
pine
notes
in
the
background
as
well
lots
of
toasted
bread
throughout
tastes
quite
heavy
on
the
lemon
there
is
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
just
a
hint
of
grapefruit
a
light
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
a
solid
bready
malt
flavor
pours
a
dark
clear
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
surprisingly
hoppy
taste
is
grassy
and
citrus
hops
with
a
heavy
bready
malt
backbone
and
a
hint
of
diacetyl
the
label
describes
it
as
earthy
which
is
a
pretty
good
adjective
has
that
dank
kinda
flavor
fully
medium
bodied
there
was
some
kind
of
funky
lingering
aftertaste
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
or
a
description
on
but
it
wasnt
good
really
liked
this
at
first
but
that
funky
aftertaste
just
took
away
too
much
for
me
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
really
more
the
smell
of
an
ipa
or
at
least
an
extra
pale
ale
but
the
taste
was
far
more
chill
with
lots
of
malt
and
only
light
hops
nice
abv
for
the
taste
flavor
might
be
a
bit
weak
but
then
again
this
is
a
pale
ale
and
not
an
ipa
very
high
drinkability
an
awesome
beer
i
think
it
is
better
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
o
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
but
they
just
dont
seem
to
combine
well
for
me
good
but
just
not
compelling
for
me
do
this
new
pale
ale
boasts
of
some
impressive
hop
cultivars
while
their
inclusion
is
evident
the
entire
beer
seems
like
something
of
a
compromise
it
is
a
decent
apa
not
really
better
than
mighty
arrow
which
preceded
itjust
different
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
malthop
combo
but
i
think
it
will
grow
on
me
as
i
get
through
the
bottles
a
pretty
basic
american
pale
its
decent
but
nothing
special
overall
this
has
that
traditional
new
belgium
hoppy
taste
but
its
really
good
i
do
like
the
crisp
applecaramel
malt
taste
best
apa
offering
ive
run
into
in
a
long
time
such
a
shame
that
its
only
a
seasonal
overall
surprisingly
light
in
the
hop
department
but
then
again
the
diacetyl
was
also
a
rather
unexpected
encounter
leaving
me
to
wonder
if
this
particular
batch
was
off
or
if
this
is
indeed
what
they
had
intended
o
nothing
special
but
an
easy
drinker
modest
hopping
decent
earthy
lemon
hop
hop
notes
relatively
clean
finish
o
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
with
the
mainstreamification
of
fat
tire
i
tend
to
forget
that
new
belgium
does
a
lot
of
great
beers
ill
definitely
be
reaching
for
this
beer
again
its
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
pleasantly
bitter
beer
ive
had
since
i
started
this
enjoying
my
beer
thing
this
is
not
a
deep
beer
but
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
tasty
ale
with
pilsner
qualities
nice
refreshing
ale
this
will
be
great
as
a
summer
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
nice
copper
color
nice
head
fruity
crisp
smell
in
fact
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
its
best
attribute
the
taste
however
is
another
story
i
would
describe
it
best
as
a
bitterdry
variation
of
fat
tire
not
a
very
balanced
beer
disappointing
to
me
since
mighty
arrow
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
seasonals
overall
i
like
the
use
of
sorachi
hops
otherwise
its
your
usually
new
belgium
six
pack
offering
simple
and
highly
drinkable
but
nothing
to
blow
me
away
i
enjoyed
mighty
arrow
and
i
dont
think
this
can
replace
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
you
could
also
say
bronze
with
a
thumbs
width
white
head
the
head
though
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
and
within
a
couple
minutes
at
most
its
vanished
leaving
behind
a
spotty
coating
on
the
surface
with
majority
of
the
remains
around
the
edges
wonderful
aroma
initial
hit
of
some
sweet
but
bright
lemon
rind
following
behind
that
is
the
sweet
tropical
fruits
and
caramel
malt
as
it
warms
the
sweet
layer
becomes
the
dominant
aroma
i
wish
the
aroma
could
have
been
a
little
bigger
and
bolder
but
it
is
still
mighty
fine
flavor
is
awesome
though
again
i
wish
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
assertive
and
smacked
you
in
the
face
sweet
tropical
fruity
some
peach
and
a
touch
of
prickly
bitterness
a
little
pepper
and
hop
bitterness
lingers
very
nice
and
well
balanced
a
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
bunch
of
carbonation
it
needs
the
carbonation
though
not
sure
it
needs
as
much
as
it
has
not
that
big
a
deal
though
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
much
fantastic
and
my
first
new
belgium
sixpack
offering
that
i
have
been
genuinely
pleased
with
i
tried
a
bunch
of
stuff
i
didnt
care
a
heck
of
a
lot
for
some
were
decent
but
average
others
just
plain
no
good
but
it
was
all
worth
it
to
get
to
this
great
seasonal
i
look
forward
to
drinking
a
bunch
of
this
during
its
release
o
meh
just
another
in
a
long
line
of
mediocre
spring
seasonals
its
not
terrible
just
not
all
that
great
though
either
dig
pale
ale
from
new
belgium
is
another
fine
creation
the
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
with
white
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
the
smell
included
citrus
and
peach
the
taste
was
a
bit
bitter
with
peach
at
the
front
and
grapefruit
in
the
end
decent
malt
balance
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
ale
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
there
is
a
belgium
sugar
twang
at
the
end
which
i
am
not
fond
of
i
hope
this
didnt
replace
might
arrow
clear
amber
color
under
a
persistent
bubbly
head
that
leaves
behind
abundant
lace
zesty
resinous
nose
leafy
citrus
oil
light
grain
and
a
touch
of
cattiness
fresh
oily
hop
flavor
earthy
lemon
stone
fruit
sweetness
some
buttery
malt
definitely
has
a
certain
dankness
going
on
mediumlight
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
a
quality
refreshing
spring
seasonal
they
seem
to
be
switching
up
the
seasonal
selections
all
the
time
but
this
ones
a
keeper
a
spring
seasonal
that
has
been
out
for
a
few
weeks
in
early
feb
seems
kinda
oddbut
heh
i
picked
it
up
anyway
poured
into
a
standard
pint
a
clear
copper
with
a
frothy
12
finger
white
head
atop
lemony
aromas
with
some
caramel
sweetnessnot
overly
assertive
but
not
bad
drunken
apricots
and
caramel
sweetness
on
the
palate
the
light
sweetness
makes
me
wanna
grab
morethe
hop
profile
is
not
big
but
plays
a
big
role
in
bringing
everything
together
in
this
beer
iam
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sorachi
ace
hop
but
it
goes
well
with
the
other
hops
in
this
beera
very
good
sessionable
ale
here
although
the
alcohol
is
a
little
high
for
that
title
o
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
i
like
the
choice
of
hops
in
this
one
o
while
this
beer
seems
almost
more
like
a
straight
up
ipa
than
an
apa
it
is
sweet
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
was
at
least
10x
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
totally
welcome
that
also
at
only
5
6
i
could
easily
pop
a
few
of
these
oa
very
very
good
beer
for
the
springtime
indeed
o
great
brew
really
liking
this
one
o
better
than
average
apa
could
drink
a
few
in
a
row
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
fresh
cut
grass
the
taste
is
nicely
hoppy
with
good
balancing
malt
there
is
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
nothing
overboard
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
watery
texture
and
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
new
belgium
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
subjectively
i
find
it
rather
forgettable
in
the
taste
department
its
like
a
half
and
half
of
fat
tire
and
sn
pale
ale
overall
this
pale
ale
is
good
but
i
do
not
like
the
peppery
musty
quality
of
this
drink
it
almost
imparts
a
phenolic
quality
to
this
beer
otherwise
it
is
well
done
o
overall
a
nice
seasonal
offering
from
new
belgium
very
refreshing
and
makes
me
wish
there
wasnt
snow
in
the
ground
o
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
well
done
again
new
belgium
amber
and
pretty
clear
decent

and

smell
is
quite
malty
with
a
little
citrus
fruit
and
spice
subdued
but
nice
taste
is
far
more
bold
than
youd
think
it
would
be
from
the
smell
earthy
malts
are
plentiful
balanced
with
a
bit
of
citrus
some
crispy
hops
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
body
is
pretty
light
and
well
carbonated
with
just
a
touch
of
bite
its
a
rather
pleasant
beer
to
drink
i
like
that
its
not
heavily
over
the
top
with
nb
instead
just
producing
a
solid
tasty
apa
for
this
seasonal
i
would
certainly
drink
this
one
again
new
belgium
does
beautiful
things
with
these
less
common
hops
i
love
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
and
the
sorachi
ace
add
a
great
spicy
note
coppery
pour
with
an
inch
of

it

sweet
clean
and

taste

caramelnutty
sweet
but
crisp
and
clean
due
to
generous
carbonation
and
hop
not
bitter
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
interesting
beer
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
pretty
solid
pale
that
is
fine
on
its
own
but
wouldnt
hold
up
with
most
of
the
classicsstandards
of
the
style
this
is
one
impressive
beer
i
love
the
maltiness
along
with
the
nice
bitterness
to
balance
it
off
new
belgium
really
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
o
phenominal
spring
pale
ale
can
see
myself
going
through
a
case
of
this
before
nb
moves
on
to
the
next
seasonal
in
the
end
i
like
it
and
i
dont
i
feel
like
with
the
seasonal
beers
new
belgium
is
always
holding
back
everything
seems
to
be
in
a
pale
ale
sort
of
mold
not
too
strong
a
little
hoppy
appealing
to
everyone
i
like
the
nelson
sauvin
hop
alot
and
when
i
get
a
note
of
it
it
really
wows
but
unfortuantely
it
isnt
intense
enough
and
gets
lost
in
the
mix
mostly
i
would
guess
this
time
next
year
nb
will
be
coming
out
with
yet
again
something
different
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
awesome
beer
give
it
a
shot
and
check
your
prejudice
before
you
pour
nb
is
pumping
out
some
super
high
quality
stuff
right
now
do
you
see
where
im
going
with
this
one
o
overall
a
perfect
springtime
brew
clean
delicious
and
fresh
basically
its
fat
tire
with
a
slightly
different
hop
schedule
nb
seems
to
be
getting
away
from
their
original
belgium
focus
we
get
new
seasonals
each
year
that
are
difficult
to
tell
apart
id
love
to
see
them
bring
back
the
great
porch
swing
single
from
the
late
90s
as
a
spring
seasonal
oh
well
pours
a
golden
on
copper
ale
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
and
excellent
clarity
smells
fruity
with
pineapple
mango
cherry
sweet
and
a
nice
sweet
and
english
malt
profile
it
tastes
sweet
and
candy
like
with
the
hops
im
really
surprisedintrigued
with
how
they
get
such
a
sweet
beer
with
the
hops
and
the
hops
are
obviously
fruity
and
tropical
the
mouth
is
thin
with
moderate
on
hi
carb
and
a
forgettable
finish
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
its
fun
but
easy
o
its
a
fine
beer
it
actually
isnt
all
that
different
than
fat
tire
on
the
whole
its
ok
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
and
goes
down
so
pleasantly
overall
this
is
a
perfect
spring
time
beer
and
involves
some
great
flavors
however
its
not
even
spring
yet
and
its
really
crappy
outside
by
the
time
its
nice
enough
outside
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
hops
will
have
fallen
off
into
the
distance
other
than
that
qualm
great
beer
o
new
belgium
makes
another
solid
beer
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
it
is
a
perfect
sit
around
and
do
nothing
beer
i
am
glad
this
is
a
new
seasonal
overall
i
like
the
use
of
the
sorachi
ace
and
nelson
sauvin
hops
the
typical
new
belgium
biscuit
flavor
annoys
me
slightly
but
ultimately
the
beer
works
quite
well
and
is
refreshing
slightly
better
than
the
previous
seasonal
mighty
arrow
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
the
other
day
as
it
was
new
to
the
shelves
and
found
myself
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
latest
new
belgium
offering
the
complimentary
mix
of
hop
varietals
here
really
bounced
each
other
nicely
and
just
gave
this
a
flavorful
crispness
that
really
made
this
an
easy
drinking
quencher
im
going
to
be
grabbing
a
full
sixer
of
this
its
darn
tasty
stuff
overall
this
was
really
enjoyable
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
while
not
being
overly
bitter
very
drinkable
i
am
a
big
fan
of
nb
and
this
doesnt
disappoint
balance
is
the
word
for
this
pale
ale
i
must
say
the
new
belgium
brewery
has
failed
to
disappoint
me
yet
they
are
damn
good
at
this
i
think
i
found
a
pale
ale
that
is
as
delicious
as
liberty
ale
foamy
creamy
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
citrus
smell
is
outrageous
some
earthyness
as
well
as
a
hint
if
biscuit
the
taste
is
exacty
how
it
smells
grapefruit
lemon
zest
and
maybe
a
but
of
peach
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
solid
brew
by
new
belgium

1
a
tasty
fruity
pale
ale
and
a
great
spring
beer
light
and
refreshing
but
full
of
fruit
and
well
balanced
i
love
me
some
nelson
sauvin
hops
and
the
sorachi
ace
contributes
nice
subtle
citrus
zest
notes
i
feel
like
theres
something
missing
that
keeps
me
from
rating
it
higher
complexity
maybe
but
it
is
good
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
i
like
how
this
beer
is
different
than
most
pales
and
sets
itself
apart
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
revisit
but
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
overall
a
very
nicely
balanced
beautiful
boquet
of
hops
nice
aroma
and
flavor
balance
easy
to
drink
great
beer
overall
this
is
an
average
pale
ale
i
wish
that
it
was
more
hop
forward
i
feel
like
that
would
have
given
it
a
nudge
in
the
right
direction
to
take
it
to
above
average
im
sitting
in
my
back
yard
on
a
beautiful
day
and
it
definitely
is
the
right
beer
for
the
situation
very
easy
drinking
and
very
sessionable
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
sixer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
1
inch
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
nice
tight
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
tropical
fruits
citrus
zest
grapefruit
and
some
earthy
herbal
hops
taste
is
of
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
zest
up
front
with
a
malt
backbone
the
aftertaste
has
a
mild
herbal
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
that
has
a
nice
smell
and
taste
very
drinkable
stuff
overall
who
cares
about
the
look
or
the
nose
when
the
flavor
is
there
this
is
solid
pale
ale
that
is
reasonably
priced
and
very
sessionable
well
done
nb
taste
shows
some
well
balanced
use
of
malt
and
hops
but
thats
not
what
i
want
here
dammit
the
yeast
here
is
most
assuredly
the
same
as
used
in
fat
tire
it
has
the
same
nutty
creaminess
to
it
which
is
fine
but
the
malts
are
too
prominent
for
me
its
baffling
really
new
belgium
certainly
is
not
afraid
to
throw
out
plenty
of
hops
ranger
2
below
snow
day
etc
so
i
am
surprised
at
this
one
its
not
bad
by
any
means
i
just
think
they
could
have
showcased
the
zesty
lemony
sorachi
hops
better
with
a
cleaner
more
lightly
malted
beer
oh
well
fun
to
have
once
but
i
am
on
the
fence
whether
or
not
i
would
buy
a
whole
sixer
leaning
towards
not
light
orange
pour
with
a
twofinger
cream
head
but
minimal
lacing
smells
like
orange
peel
and
musty
malts
the
taste
has
more
hops
and
more
fruitorange
and
lemon
zest
too
much
grapefruit
biscuit
malt
but
also
a
very
bitter
grassy
quality
which
kind
of
ruins
it
for
me
it
drinks
well
otherwise
on
the
light
end
and
wellcarbonated
but
i
just
didnt
like
the
flavor
profile
enough
to
go
for
this
one
again
damn
this
drinks
so
easy
clearly
one
of
the
better
hop
forward
beers
ive
had
from
new
belgium
having
said
that
i
really
dig
pun
intended
belgo
too
dig
would
be
a
nice
summer
time
brew
fat
into
the
dog
days
a
top
rung
apa
to
me
yeah
this
is
a
textbook
3
certainly
dont
feel
like
i
wasted
my
money
but
there
are
far
better
uses
for
it
in
the
future
o
it
is
fresh
and
springlike
so
dig
will
make
a
great
seasonal
a
little
cold
out
right
now
but
i
can
envision
myself
sitting
out
on
my
back
porch
after
a
day
of
work
sipping
on
this
and
watching
my
garden
grow
overall
45
tettering
here
i
think
the
grapefruit
flavor
is
a
bit
much
but
its
very
refreshing
which
is
what
it
aims
to
be
i
will
enjoy
this
as
a
light
alternative
to
double
ipas
and
belgian
beers
o
tasty
and
drinkable
i
like
this
one
like
i
enjoy
hoptober
in
the
fall
this
is
a
winner
for
nb
will
drink
more
this
winter
and
enjoy
it
even
more
this
spring
a
well
crafted
brew
here
me
thinks
cant
tell
you
why
im
so
jazzed
to
try
out
the
new
new
belgium
seasonal
but
i
kinda
am
it
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
something
about
this
beer
strikes
me
as
unusually
goodlooking
the
nose
comprises
sparkling
lemon
zest
light
peach
light
caramel
and
a
touch
of
minty
pine
needle
if
some
of
these
were
a
bit
stronger
this
would
smell
damn
pleasant
as
it
is
it
aint
close
to
bad
the
taste
halts
the
love
train
bringing
notes
of
orange
peel
grapefruit
rind
in
both
cases
the
white
part
only
along
with
a
lick
of
the
unwashed
outside
light
caramel
light
pine
resin
and
bitter
chlorophyllladen
grass
im
gonna
assume
the
sorachi
hops
ruined
things
as
usual
but
its
not
normally
like
this
when
they
do
what
with
the
sharp
bitterness
and
all
i
got
nothin
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nicelooking
and
smelling
beer
but
one
that
falls
apart
in
the
flavor
department
still
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
and
i
wouldnt
necessarily
turn
down
a
free
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
i
am
a
whore
for
sorachi
ace
hops
ever
since
brooklyns
introduction
i
sleeze
for
this
hop
profile
this
one
smells
like
tropical
compost
decaying
mangos
banannas
and
citrus
fruit
not
like
flies
all
over
the
shop
but
just
past
ripe
really
nectary
flavor
is
more
lemony
from
the
hops
bitter
to
a
degree
but
not
an
bitter
bomb
this
brew
is
extraordinary
super
super
drinkable
with
a
lighter
body
and
a
crisp
finish
one
of
my
favorite
new
belgium
beers
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
one
and
its
food
pairings
but
ill
just
say
this
is
a
must
try
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
indeed
one
of
the
better
nb
brews
ive
enjoyed
in
a
while
good
stuff
overall
with
good
taste
and
good
drinkability
ill
buy
it
again
cant
say
i
wont
miss
mighty
arrow
though
aroma
is
a
very
heady
mix
of
juicy
red
grapefruit
blended
with
lemonade
and
a
background
structure
of
spicyherbal
hop
aroma
blended
well
of
appropriate
mildness
for
the
pale
ale
category
biscuity
malt
scent
is
hard
to
pick
up
on
until
the
brew
has
a
chance
to
warm
up
somewhat
has
a
transparent
coppery
amber
color
and
a
two
finger
soap
detergent
texture
of
a
head
with
nickelsized
loops
of
lacing
left
behind
with
each
sip
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
white
pepper
and
saazlike
crisp
spiciness
emphasis
than
somehow
manages
to
visit
every
kind
of
hopping
flavor
profile
in
rapid
succession
except
for
tropical
fruit
and
pine
resin
all
at
an
appropriately
gentle
level
for
a
pale
ale
and
balanced
with
a
bready
malt
im
impressed
with
the
high
level
of
flavor
complexity
considering
how
restrained
and
subtle
it
is
texture
is
mediumlight
well
carbonated
zippy
and
crisp
across
the
tongue
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
it
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
had
my
first
peeper
at
when
pigs
fly
in
kittery
me
on
tap
about
5
years
ago
when
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
at
trader
joes
i
buy
it
constently
it
is
as
solid
as
an
apa
gets
cant
rank
it
higher
than
a
4
because
i
just
like
my
ipa
along
with
the
rest
of
em
on
tap
hazy
yellow
aromas
of
lemongrass
wheat
spice
the
flavors
match
lightbodied
crisp
with
a
bit
of
spice
simple
but
well
made
tasty
very
good
a
clean
and
refreshing
ale
with
citrus
and
fruity
notes
overall
an
very
good
american
pale
its
refreshing
bright
and
easy
drinking
i
wish
the
citrus
would
pop
a
bit
more
as
the
earthy
hops
are
a
bit
over
powering
still
a
solid
pale
ale
and
im
always
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
pick
one
up
i
feel
like
im
not
doing
this
beer
justice
is
been
in
the
bottle
almost
6
months
so
it
was
a
little
malt
forward
but
still
being
out
of
date
it
was
pretty
good
props
to
maine
light
and
refreshing
with
an
extremely
clean
aftertaste
characteristic
of
maine
beer
co
not
their
hoppiest
beer
but
its
one
of
the
better
ales
ive
had
o
this
is
a
great
apa
great
flavors
decent
complexity
and
very
clean
tasting
absolutely
fantastic
on
tap
in
portland
had
previously
in
bottle
which
was
bettee
maybe
old
draft
or
line
come
on
ri
ra
beautiful
golden
straw
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
holds
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
grassy
minimal
fruit
taste
is
nice
and
clean
grassy
not
much
fruit
but
piney
resin
on
the
back
end
lingers
nicely
ive
enjoyed
peeper
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
beer
id
recommend
anything
that
these
guys
bottle
i
think
this
is
a
perfect
gateway
beer
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
good
beers
its
just
better
than
most
beers
without
being
abrasive
at
all
and
without
using
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
just
pleasant
hop
flavors
with
a
hint
of
bready
malt
overall
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
i
should
have
gotten
another
bottle
of
titan
porter
poured
from
bottle
bottled
1118
consumed
111
to
tulip
glass
straw
to
light
gold
color
with
average
size
head
1
inch
froth
head
which
quickly
diminishes
and
slightly
hazy
body
from
bottle
conditioning
fruity
aroma
with
grainy
bready
malt
similar
to
a
munich
helles
hops
come
through
with
citric
notes
of
lime
and
earthy
tones
underneath
there
are
additional
notes
of
cinnamon
slight
clove
golden
raisins
and
moscato
grape
sweetness
the
body
comes
off
as
light
and
dry
with
lively
carbonation
flavor
profile
is
balanced
not
overly
sweet
but
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
lingering
on
the
palate
not
as
hoppy
as
mo
or
their
other
beers
but
perfectly
balanced
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
nice
dry
crisp
finish
makes
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malts
this
is
what
all
other
pale
ales
should
aspire
to
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
a
while
i
thought
it
would
be
lighter
than
it
turned
out
to
be
loaded
with
hops
it
almost
crosses
into
ipa
territory
a
nice
hoppy
offering
but
a
notch
below
the
incredible
mo
and
lunch
cloudy
straw
colored
with
decent
head
and
moderate
carbonation
sweetness
citrus
lemongrass
aroma
strong
lemon
lemongrass
flavor
the
citrus
overpowers
the
other
flavors
o
awesome
stuff
very
hoppy
apa
but
superbly
crafted
thank
goodness
for
american
breweries
not
caring
much
for
categories
mouthfeel
is
light
and
good
overall
drinkable
tasty
but
not
very
special
get
a
chance
try
the
wet
peeper
novare
res
portland
me
overall
a
nice
light
apa
that
taste
a
little
less
fruit
than
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
dry
earthy
woody
hop
bite
than
a
the
fruity
juicy
one
i
get
with
their
other
hoppy
brews
pleasant
floral
aroma
along
with
some
citrusy
hops
and
lightly
toasted
grain
in
the
nose
tasted
of
a
good
blend
of
sweet
bitter
and
herbal
hops
up
front
eventually
subdued
by
a
light
malty
flavor
like
a
salt
less
cracker
for
me
but
ive
seen
others
describe
it
as
shortbread
ends
well
with
the
taste
of
citrus
again
really
nicely
blended
here
very
smooth
medium
bodied
apa
at
three
penny
taproom
in
montpelier
at
the
same
sitting
with
an
edward
completely
solid
apa
would
definitely
have
again
makes
me
really
curious
about
their
other
stuff
well
wroth
trying
4
25
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hops
hint
of
pepper
hint
of
floral
and
a
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hops
hint
of
yeast
hint
of
alcohol
hint
of
floral
and
a
hint
of
pine
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
overall
this
is
a
great
lightbodied
apa
with
subtle
but
delicious
flavor
definitely
worth
trying
to
get
overall
just
excellent
great
beer
good
flavor
but
a
bit
lighter
on
the
palate
than
i
was
expecting
a
little
thin
bodied
and
quite
dry
but
this
one
has
a
really
pleasant
well
balanced
hoppy
finish
not
very
bitter
at
all
but
just
enough
for
the
overall
lightness
of
the
malt
grassy
and
lemony
with
a
bit
of
a
peppery
herbal
tint
the
malt
is
pretty
unremarkable
very
clean
and
unobtrusive
clearly
intended
to
showcase
hops
without
getting
in
the
way
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
peppery
flavor
im
getting
it
really
shares
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
a
witbier
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
a
strangely
peppery
tingle
in
the
finish
its
a
really
wellmade
beer
and
something
id
want
to
drink
while
relaxing
on
the
beach
in
the
middle
of
summer
not
the
cheapest
beer
at
6
a
bottle
but
it
is
good
artistry
is
usually
expensive
quality
beer
right
here
its
not
often
one
ill
pick
up
but
i
enjoy
it
when
i
do
o
an
enjoyable
satisfying
pale
thats
more
tropical
and
refreshing
than
your
typical
apa
bright
bold
and
definitely
worth
a
purchase
if
you
havent
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
a
fresh
maine
beer
co
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
your
best
to
do
so
bottled
on
9214
easily
the
freshest
beer
ive
had
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
think
i
understand
the
whole
drink
fresh
thing
the
beer
itself
was
quite
good
very
clean
and
balanced
and
lightly
carbonated
but
the
flavor
surely
due
to
how
recently
it
was
bottled
was
really
bright
and
pronounced
very
impressive
will
have
to
get
more
of
this
sooner
than
later
o
good
very
clean
beer
there
is
not
much
that
i
dislike
from
the
maine
beer
company
theyre
putting
out
some
great
beers
its
smooth
and
bitter
finish
washes
the
thirst
from
the
palate
with
a
dry
character
of
citrus
peel
light
tangy
acidity
and
faint
hopderived
tannic
character
clean
to
the
point
where
light
seltzertype
mineral
flavors
reveal
themselves
just
ahead
of
an
aid
also
from
alcohol
dryness
serving
type
bottle
rather
have
another
one
but
a
good
beer
o
if
this
were
an
easily
available
beer
i
would
choose
this
over
most
any
session
ipa
on
the
market
right
now
easy
drinking
with
all
the
hop
character
of
an
ipa
excellent
brew
very
smooth
a
little
bit
creamy
with
a
very
nice
carb
o
i
like
it
i
liked
lunch
better
overall
a
superior
apa
o
excellent
brew
well
rounded
on
all
accounts
in
scent
flavor
and
body
bought
in
columbia
sc
at
whole
foods
drank
in
pensacola
fl
overall
plenty
of
good
things
going
on
here
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
from
maine
right
at
their
three
month
mark
not
really
showing
many
signs
of
being
too
old
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
maine
to
date
o
solid
ale
i
know
this
is
the
trademark
beer
from
maine
beer
co
and
having
reviewed
some
of
their
other
beers
i
expected
a
bit
more
very
drinkable
very
simple
and
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
jump
on
peeper
its
very
fresh
and
crisp
meets
the
criteria
for
an
ale
but
seems
pretty
flavorless
to
me
o
just
a
solid
beeron
the
hoppier
side
for
a
pale
ale
but
it
still
has
subtlety
and
nuance
in
its
delivery
o
this
beer
is
better
than
expected
maine
beer
co
has
not
let
me
down
yet
excellent
beer
and
brewer
my
love
affair
with
this
brewery
continues
with
this
light
hazy
yellow
offering
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
and
topped
with
a
copious
amount
of
creamy
white
head
that
may
have
left
some
of
the
most
intricate
lacing
ive
seen
on
a
beer
glass
extending
all
the
way
from
top
to
bottom
aroma
is
sublime
very
hopforward
with
a
hint
of
crackerlike
malt
lemon
lime
grapefruit
and
a
little
tropical
guava
perhaps
along
with
a
rock
candylike
sweet
undercurrent
was
hoping
the
taste
would
match
this
assertive
aroma
but
alas
this
is
one
of
those
times
where
the
aroma
drives
much
of
the
pleasurable
experience
that
is
drinking
this
beer
not
that
the
taste
is
poor
far
from
it
quite
dry
and
crisp
though
with
little
of
the
caramel
malt
flavor
prominent
in
this
brewerys
ipas
this
being
replaced
by
dry
crackers
sourdough
crust
and
a
whiff
of
grainy
tannins
hop
flavor
translates
to
me
as
unsweetened
lemonlime
soda
an
effect
heightened
by
the
intense
carbonation
still
struck
by
how
dry
this
is
with
some
minerals
apparent
in
the
green
nearleafy
finish
lovely
aroma
and
crisp
mouthfeel
would
bring
me
back
yet
another
winner
from
maine
its
been
a
while
since
ive
tried
this
many
beers
from
a
brewery
and
all
of
them
have
been
great
i
hope
we
get
some
new
ones
to
try
in
the
near
future
overall
just
a
stellar
apa
i
know
its
not
as
reputed
as
some
other
hopforward
takes
on
the
style
or
even
other
beers
in
the
same
style
category
from
this
very
brewery
but
it
is
certainly
just
as
worthy
of
being
highly
regarded
both
for
its
style
and
as
a
standalone
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
and
again
especially
during
the
ho
t
summer
months
overall
a
spoton
american
pale
ale
with
a
nice
wellrounded
balance
of
hops
and
malts
a
lovely
beer
with
nice
crisp
floral
and
citrus
notes
and
a
snappy
finish
while
retaining
a
general
lightness
pours
a
hazy
dark
straw
color
with
a
snow
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
snappy
floral
and
herbal
aromas
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
a
touch
of
orange
citrus
very
integrated
with
balanced
flavors
that
play
off
each
other
nicely
the
citrus
comes
through
but
herbal
and
floral
throughout
with
a
fairly
long
somewhat
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
and
sustains
your
interest
excellent
beer
pour
is
a
light
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
white
head
very
nicely
balanced
nose
very
clean
grain
bill
up
front
bready
and
lightly
doughy
hop
balance
adds
a
strong
hop
punch
a
good
bit
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
resiny
hop
taste
is
also
very
balanced
the
grain
bill
is
nicely
done
bready
and
just
a
touch
of
dough
malt
gets
a
touch
sweet
moving
into
a
citrusy
hop
a
hint
of
herbal
hop
and
a
faint
pepper
in
the
back
body
is
lighter
a
touch
slick
and
has
an
assertive
carbonation
would
have
preferred
pleasant
and
resinous
pine
another
pretty
tasty
and
dry
pale
ale
from
this
brewery
i
like
a
nice
crisp
finish
to
make
me
pine
heh
for
another
swig
and
maine
beers
seem
to
have
that
in
spades
hoppy
crackery
and
easy
as
sin
to
drink
now
what
the
hell
is
a
peeper
in
the
context
of
this
offering
nothing
is
proffered
as
such
on
the
label
light
golden
appearance
very
light
but
visible
head
upon
pouring
it
was
much
less
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
and
left
a
slight
soapy
after
taste
that
i
wasnt
too
fond
if
poured
from
a
1
pint
9fl
oz
bottle
this
beer
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
o
really
good
lighter
than
most
apas
both
in
color
and
body
hazy
golden

big
fluffy
head
looks
like
beer
looks
in
an
ad
subtle
nose
of
hops
and
malt
prickly
carbonation
with
a
lighter
body
nice
crisp
flavors
the
finish
was
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
or
particularly
long
lasting
not
a
massive
hoppy
beer
that
beer
geeks
generally
rave
about
but
still
very
solid
very
quaffable
beer
o
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
tried
in
a
while
very
well
done
and
definitely
drinkable
goldenyellow
color
with
a
gentle
foamy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
general
ring
along
the
edge
nice
hoppy
aroma
of
citrus
tastes
of
grapefruit
and
the
biting
hop
bitterness
is
present
on
the
tongue
too
good
carbonation
and
quite
delightful
to
drink
hits
the
spot
pours
a
hazy

with
hints
of
amber
and
a
finger
head
with
good
retention
smells
of
wheat
and
hops
both
conservatively
taste
picks
up
with
a
slight
lemon
mixed
with
a
great
balance
of

and

this
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
enjoyable

fine

had
this
fresh
under
two
weeks
pours
into
pint
glass
fairly
light
golden
in
color
big
bubbly
white
head
its
a
great
hoppy
pale
juicy
and
smooth
really
refreshing
lot
of
sweet
citrus
and
lime
peel
coming
forth
over
all
a
great
beer
worth
a
try
for
pale
ale
or
ipa
lovers
i
got
this
beer
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
i
had
never
heard
of
this
company
before
and
was
pretty
excited
to
try
it
it
did
not
disappoint
nice
crisp
hoppy
taste
although
i
am
a
fan
of
hoppier
beer
this
one
was
mild
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
of
them
now
if
only
i
had
a
few
of
them
overall
delicious
like
a
light
but
fulltasting
lagerlike
loved
it
wish
i
had
more
a
very
strong
offering
that
doesnt
deviate
too
much
into
the
unknown
the
nose
is
very
hoppy
for
the
style
the
hop
bitterness
is
evident
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
it
does
not
taste
as
potent
as
the
nose
would
indicate
the
taste
is
lighter
and
dryer
than
most
highlevel
apas
this
is
more
akin
to
the
substyle
generally
known
as
a
session
ipa
than
a
classic
apa
id
definitely
prefer
to
drink
this
in
the
baking
heat
of
the
summer
than
in
the
waning
days
of
winter
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
with
its
toasted
biscuit
character
and
floral
citrus
hop
finish
it
is
highly
appealing
now
but
i
bet
it
would
be
nicer
on
a
hot
day
it
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
intensely
hoppy
with
spice
grass
florals
and
light
tropical
fruit
maybe
a
hint
of
bread
the
flavor
is
dry
with
a
spicy
hop
kick
lots
of
grassy
florals
and
big
citrus
character
crackery
malts
near
the
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
hop
forward
apa
pepper
ale
is
a
super
enjoyable
beer
that
even
when
drunk
slightly
outside
of
the
brewerys
recommended
90
days
from
bottling
window
shame
on
me
is
brimming
with
pleasant
hoppiness
to
think
that
not
too
long
ago
these
two
brothers
were
brewing
in
their
garage
robbing
the
world
of
their
talents
how
dare
they
deprive
us
of
such
greatness
i
bought
two
bottles
for
5
99
each
and
although
they
werent
ridiculously
fresh
its
always
dependable
and
is
a
great
value
500ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
head
that
didnt
linger
long
but
did
leave
some
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
some
floral
citrus
and
musky
notes
the
taste
is
good
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
not
overdone
some
citrus
malts
are
fairly
well
hidden
with
no
sweetness
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
crisp
a
very
nice
apa
prost
arguably
overpriced
for
regular
consumption
but
too
good
to
pass
on
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
lightly
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
nose
is
very
subdued
and
lacking
in
aroma
taste
is
dry
hops
with
some
light
crisp
malt
profiles
the
malt
disappears
and
becomes
more
dry
wheat
and
hops
very
simple
not
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
beer
is
ridiculously
drinkable
just
not
a
very
memorable
pale
ale
i
would
take
a
daisy
cutter
over
this
any
day
this
is
the
first
maine
beer
that
hasnt
wowd
me
o
great
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
am
not
a
big
apa
guy
but
i
can
recognize
exceptional
work
when
i
see
it
glad
to
have
maine
brewing
in
chicago
o
quality
wellbalanced
apa
definitely
recommend
a
try
overall
this
is
a
really
good
american
ale
great
fresh
unaggressive
hop
flavors
that
are
balanced
out
with
a
medium
body
and
tied
together
with
a
dry
finish
o
another
excellent
beer
from
maine
beer
id
drink
a
lot
more
of
it
if
it
wasnt
twice
the
price
it
should
be
for
comparable
products
moderate
bitterness
very
light
and
airy
feel
earthy
herbal
green
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
bitter
greens
light
citrus
peel
pale
malt
flavors
quite
drinkable
and
clean
overall
a
very
nice
apa
a
classic
some
might
say
though
a
tad
pricey
for
what
it
is
o
light
orange
and
malt
forward
getting
a
bit
old
but
still
solid
tasted
this
again
the
one
difference
i
picked
up
from
the
last
time
was
that
i
thought
this
ale
was
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
then
i
remembered
still
a
very
sound
clean
crisp
beer
overall
a
decent
apa
from
a
great
young
brewery
for
the
price
point
probably
not
worth
drinking
on
the
reg
but
go
ahead
and
give
it
a
try
if
only
once
an
excellent
brew
for
washing
down
some
maine
seafood
had
a
fried
seafood
platter
with
this
review
but
had
a
nice
classy
paella
with
this
beer
the
night
before
very
hopforward
so
the
grains
take
a
secondary
position
to
things
but
its
all
good
a
first
rate
satisfying
thirst
quenching
ale
this
is
a
very
light
5
5
abv
ale
packed
full
of
hops
but
balanced
quite
well
the
flavors
come
in
waves
overall
theyre
a
little
bright
for
me
it
almost
comes
across
as
hoppy
seltzer
water
especially
as
you
let
it
linger
in
your
mouth
longer
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
i
imagine
pale
gold
with
maybe
just
a
touch
of
orange
around
the
edges
bright
white
fluffy
head
some
strings
of
lace
and
very
nice
retention
smell
is
quite
refreshing
and
mouthwatering
happy
in
general
grassy
brisk
floral
and
a
little
stinky
too
smells
a
little
bit
wild
farmhouse
taste
is
dry
brisk
peppery
floral
herbal
dank
and
citrus
rindy
mouthfeel
is
dry
tingly
juicy
and
resinous
overall
pretty
good
stuff
i
would
think
best
on
a
hot
summer
day
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
on
the
first
pour
with
a
lovely
sudsy
white
head
fresh
clean
oily
citrus
hop
aroma
flowery
with
a
waft
of
cereal
grain
a
little
more
bitterness
upfront
than
expected
but
the
following
hoppiness
is
very
nice
again
super
oily
and
zesty
lemon
light
grapefruit
melon
perfumey
floral
notes
and
grass
light
slick
and
crisp
with
a
long
bitterness
a
good
textbook
apa
that
while
full
of
hop
flavor
doesnt
try
to
be
an
ipa
too
bad
i
only
had
the
one
small
bottle
and
it
was
as
bit
pricy
because
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
peeper
is
another
fine
brew
from
the
guys
over
at
maine
brewing
its
a
highly
sessionable
and
unique
take
on
the
style
ive
found
everything
ive
so
far
had
from
maine
to
be
expertly
crafted
i
would
certainly
drink
more
of
this
is
i
ever
come
across
it
on
shelves
jon
overall
very
solid
brew
from
mbc
which
i
am
most
definitely
going
to
drink
again
in
my
opinion
more
farmhouse
than
apa
great
complexity
and
spice
profile
taste
is
piney
at
first
blush
with
mild
bitterness
medium
feel
bubbles
play
on
the
tongue
a
little
the
malt
balances
against
the
hops
with
a
feeling
more
dry
than
i
was
expecting
some
spots
where
must
and
yeast
contrast
against
the
citrus
i
want
to
say
i
sense
a
bit
of
spice
something
in
here
feels
a
bit
belgian
in
that
way
cant
pin
it
down
my
palate
might
be
giving
me
a
false
positive
here
but
i
keep
getting
that
taste
of
light
spice
anyway
this
dries
out
a
little
on
the
aftertaste
it
seems
to
feel
both
light
and
then
not
in
the
same
moment
intriguing
and
it
keeps
me
sipping
to
see
whats
next
the
citrus
hits
and
then
pulls
back
perhaps
a
bit
of
green
apple
this
is
a
beer
that
does
a
lot
without
seeming
to
work
at
it
its
put
together
well
and
very
solid
all
around
several
pale
ales
want
to
play
like
ipa
and
hit
you
hard
but
not
this
one
its
a
really
nice
and
id
be
happy
to
have
it
again
the
price
being
1
or
2
dollars
less
than
other
mbc
bottles
gives
better
odds
for
a
return
engagement
o
this
is
a
more
hopforward
apa
that
focuses
more
on
citrus
flavors
from
what
i
perceived
the
beer
shows
restraint
and
is
not
overly
bitter
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
not
something
id
rush
out
to
get
poured
a
fresh
bottle
into
a
large
monic
glass
its
a
bit
too
light
in
color
but
the
head
is
thick
and
white
with
some
lacing
it
smells
a
bit
funky
like
a
saison
or
something
with
brett
the
taste
is
a
winner
solid
and
strong
bubbly
and
smooth
overall
one
of
my
favorites
simple
and
perfect
a
good
hoppy
pale
ale
that
is
quite
drinkable
i
keep
changing
reviews
on
this
beer
seems
better
on
tap
more
so
than
normal
beers
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
around
to
reviewing
peeper
because
every
time
i
picked
one
up
my
left
coast
buddies
wanted
it
in
in
their
box
this
is
another
solid
effort
from
mbc
and
one
that
is
almost
always
in
stock
nice
and
fresh
this
bottle
was
3
weeks
old
completely
worth
your
time
to
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
maine
beer
co
scores
again
22
oz

very
nice

peace
this
beer
is
a
really
good
american
ale
the
color
was
golden
red
the
taste
was
very
smooth
i
really
enjoy
the
mellow
tastes
of
the
maine
beer
companies
beers
this
is
a
great
ale
this
beer
has
a
great
smell
it
is
nice
to
have
an
ale
with
as
much
taste
t
because
of
the
age
tastes
almost
more
like
a
pilsner
at
this
point
but
its
still
really
good
grassy
and
peppery
hops
floral
notes
rosewater
caramel
and
bready

clean

with
notes
of
pine
and

pepper
7
for
500
ml
bottle
o
not
quite
the
citrus
thriller
that
mo
is
but
peeper
is
a
totally
different
beer
and
a
pretty
flawless
one
its
refined
ungodly
drinkable
and
interesting
from
the
first
sip
until
the
last
with
an
unlimited
budget
this
is
the
ideal
summer
beer
and
right
up
there
with
the
best
apas
available
today
o
great
hoppy
beer
lots
of
well
put
together
hop
flavors
easy
to
drink
enjoyed
this
one
alot
o
the
beer
that
turned
me
onto
mbc
and
it
still
holds
up
for
me
today
this
is
what
american
pale
ale
should
be
another
absolute
gem
from
vermont
this
time
a
bottle
shop
and
actually
a
beer
from
maine
not
vermont
itself
but
man
i
wish
i
could
get
these
ales
out
west
vermonters
dont
know
how
good
they
have
it
with
distro
and
the
like
or
maybe
they
do
in
any
event
this
is
a
real
special
beer
spring
seasonal
im
guessing
by
the
name
it
pours
a
light
frothy
honey
color
with
sexy
lace
along
my
goblet
sides
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
really
fresh
big
bright
hops
ranging
from
vegetative
to
grassy
to
floral
to
citric
and
finally
brisk
and
bitter
its
almost
the
full
spectrum
and
its
a
joy
to
drink
a
beer
this
easy
down
and
packed
with
flavor
malt
is
in
supporting
roles
only
crackery
backbone
nothing
more
the
hops
are
light
but
pungent
at
the
same
time
loosely
acidic
with
some
springtime
thawing
sort
of
quality
this
is
a
major
refresher
with
a
very
light
body
a
creamy
but
well
carbonated
feel
and
a
cruisy
5
5
abv
there
is
very
little
to
critique
about
this
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
in
years
the
east
coasters
are
onto
something
here
with
the
mighty
hop
flower
o
a
very
balanced
apa
which
is
definitely
a
good
thing
some
apas
these
day
are
just
ipas
in
disguise
not
so
with
peeper
great
fruity
hop
flavors
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
match
this
beer
is
almost
without
fault
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
od
good
tasty
and
drinkable
a
light
sessiontype
ale
for
summer
lots
of
hop
flavour
pours
a
murky
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
bright
citrus
aroma
and
flavor
overall
a
super
tasty
and
refreshing
hopbomb
pale
ale
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
downtoearth
and
serious
flavoring
we
all
get
so
used
to
the
flavor
bombs
like
zombie
dust
and
come
to
expect
everything
else
to
stylistically
match
that
type
of
take
here
we
are
taken
in
a
bit
of
a
different
direction
things
are
kept
close
to
home
and
earthy
with
the
malts
bold
and
dark
enough
to
hold
against
the
bittering
bite
and
grit
of
the
hops
through
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
fruit
and
yeast
help
to
smooth
things
out
around
the
edges
making
for
a
highly
drinkable
highly
approachable
american
pale
o
not
overly
complex
by
any
means
but
incredibly
drinkable
nice
bright
hops
flavors
with
just
enough
malt
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
ov
a
decent
pale
ale
but
ive
had
better
from
maine
beer
this
one
seemed
kind
of
vanilla
compared
to
their
other
brews
you
could
certainly
down
45
of
these
on
a
warm
day
but
if
you
want
just
one
to
really
tempt
and
excite
you
palate
their
other
beers
like
mo
and
lunch
are
better
suited
for
the
job
o
a
good
but
forgettable
apa
o
this
is
quite
good
i
must
say
but
i
have
to
dock
points
here
simply
put
its
priced
like
an
import
without
any
significant
standout
qualities
to
justify
it
6500ml
is
a
hard
sell
for
something
not
really
far
off
from
snpa
the
increased
level
of
refinement
and
subtlety
compared
to
its
peers
might
make
it
a
worthwhile
purchase
to
some
though
overall
this
is
a
perfect
spring
summer
brew
it
really
works
well
on
a
nice
day
i
am
sure
it
would
be
good
on
any
day
but
it
stood
out
particularly
in
a
warm
sunny
environment
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
soapy
like
bubbles
and
lots
of
lace
grainy
malts
first
hit
me
and
then
a
citric
and
clove
like
spice
with
bitter
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweet
yeast
in
the
aroma
beer
is
lightbodied
smooth
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
that
i
wasnt
expecting
and
balances
a
dry
grainy
bread
like
malt
with
some
citric
flavored
hops
and
spice
one
of
those
simple
beers
that
you
enjoy
every
drink
and
can
keep
on
drinking
what
a
great
refreshing
hoppy
brew
with
tons
of
character
to
enjoy
very
easydrinking
by
itself
and
im
sure
it
would
pair
nicely
with
a
wide
range
of
dishes
a
nice
simple
but
artfully
crafted
pale
ale
cheers
overall
very
nice
beer
that
rewards
the
observant
drinker
no
over
the
top
qualities
but
lots
of
aspects
that
meld
together
while
remaining
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
was
a
nice
pale
ale
but
really
nothing
special
it
had
a
simple
scent
and
taste
and
a
decent
body
it
had
a
smooth
finish
and
was
easy
to
drink
meh
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
the
trade
summer
quencher
of
an
apa
the
lemon
character
makes
this
stand
out
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
man
it
would
be
sweet
to
pop
one
of
these
out
on
the
deck
this
summer
i
will
be
revisiting
this
again
for
sure
its
a
great
apa
certainly
worth
seeking
out
whenever
you
can
since
its
definitely
not
one
to
pass
up
o
a
unique
pale
ale
with
a
big
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
presence
and
an
almost
equally
strong
spicy
and
fruity
yeastfermentation
character
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
could
be
classified
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
thats
been
made
with
american
hops
wonderful
pale
ale
having
trouble
sipping
this
slowly
enough
to
make
it
last
a
bit
longer
i
like
to
give
a
shout
out
to
my
good
friend
del
who
gave
me
this
beer
this
nice
refreshing
hoppy
apa
i
could
see
this
as
a
nice
summer
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
if
only
i
got
it
in
my
state
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
offering
a
touch
of
fresh
hops
citrus
flowery
hops
watery
body
very
light
and
quaffable
a
fine
choice
for
warmer
weather
fresh
hops
and
a
healthy
bitterness
gain
strength
in
the
finish
a
very
tasty
brew
i
cant
understand
why
the
individual
bottles
of
this
are
so
expensive
while
this
is
certainly
tasty
i
simply
dont
understand
the
8
price
tag
ive
seen
in
the
dc
metro
area
thats
more
expensive
than
a
bottle
of
bourbon
county
brand
stout
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
nothing
particularly
special
or
noteworthy
that
justifies
the
exhorbitant
price
o
ive
got
to
say
im
pretty
disappointed
not
a
disgusting
beer
but
doesnt
hit
the
right
apa
notes
for
me
what
happened
to
the
hops
doubt
it
was
an
issue
of
old
beer
since
it
was
on
tap
and
maine
beer
is
brand
new
to
ct
o
little
watery
but
the
beer
is
well
balanced
nice
hops
malt
complexity
will
hopefully
get
again
overall
pretty
solid
apa
that
i
have
enjoyed
plenty
of
times
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
still
a
good
beer
overall
4
5
call
it
personal
bias
but
to
me
this
is
what
most
american
pale
ales
should
be
like
light
crisp
dry
lemoncitrusy
and
absurdly
crushable
if
thats
a
thing
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
want
to
drink
out
of
tallboy
cans
all
summer
long
without
getting
trashed
amazing
so
refreshing
and
awesome
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
pale
hoppy
beers
light
and
bright
sessionish
beers
i
know
its
over
5
abv
relax
crisp
american
ales
or
just
life
in
general
thanks
bob
o
an
enjoyable
easydrinking
beer
quite
good
in
every
aspect
but
somewhat
unremarkable
especially
given
the
price
point
after
this
experience
ill
definitely
be
checking
out
some
other
maine
beer
co
offerings
it
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
big
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
the
best
pale
ale
next
to
maine
beer
co
mo
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
didnt
thrill
me
all
that
much
not
really
offputting
it
was
just
a
little
thin
and
kind
of
unexciting
i
may
try
it
again
some
time
just
to
see
if
my
taste
buds
were
off
but
this
is
not
something
ill
seek
that
actively
still
maine
is
a
decent
brewery
so
theproblem
may
be
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
overall
this
is
nice
its
light
and
the
bitterness
really
lingers
producing
a
clean
finish

overall
a
fairly

it
definatly
has

going
for
it
id
really
like
to
revisit
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
another
worthy
beer
from
maine
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
this
was
a
crisp
totally
enjoyable
session
pale
ale
worth
the
price
and
a
beer
i
searched
for
to
bring
home
this
beer
hit
the
mark
for
a
flavor
profile
that
works
for
my
pallet
just
enough
bitterness
and
a
pleasing
mouth
feel
and
aroma
this
is
a
very
impressive
ipa
i
recommend
trying
a
bottle
or
draft
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
that
is
always
worth
coming
back
to
o
this
is
my
first
try
at
maine
beer
comp
im
quite
impressed
i
look
forward
to
trying
thier
other
styles
as
well
as
getting
this
one
a
second
time
like
i
always
tell
people
i
drink
with
the
way
to
know
if
it
is
quality
is
if
you
would
buy
it
again
o
damn
what
a
great
pale
ale
however
i
have
some
problems
over
the
fact
that
they
dont
6
packize
this
o
a
solid
apa
easydrinking
but
with
good
hop
flavors
o
a
real
disappointment
i
paid
how
much
for
this
a
medium
body
highly
carbonated
delicious
nectar
of
the
gods
do
not
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
im
looking
at
my
bottle
and
its
from
october
were
in
january
now
i
cant
believe
the
hops
are
still
this
awesome
this
far
along
i
honestly
cant
even
imagine
what
this
is
like
fresh
then
my
pour
got
me
a
onefinger
cap
of
rocky
eggshellwhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
hazy
sunshineyellow
that
really
stood
out
at
this
late
hour
nose
smelled
like
freshbaked
lemon
bread
yeasty
zesty
bready
all
of
the
above
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
lemon
zest
flavor
immediate
on
the
tongue
it
really
did
taste
like
lemon
bread
something
that
i
have
not
baked
in
many
years
i
used
to
have
aspirations
of
becoming
a
chef
but
my
navy
recruiter
talked
me
out
of
the
kitchen
and
while
i
know
how
to
cook
i
rarely
do
so
finish
was
semidry
with
the
lemony
flavor
allowing
the
malt
a
chance
to
bring
some
sweetness
to
the
whole
affair
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
wonderful
summer
beer
and
if
the
opportunity
to
revisit
it
during
the
summer
presents
itself
i
may
do
just
that
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
that
being
said
theyll
never
blow
you
away
but
are
there
to
deliver
time
time
again
overall
maine
beer
is
killing
it
and
this
is
another
great
beer
how
do
i
get
more
of
this
poured
from
a
big
bottle
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
bottle
marked
101212
so
its
still
relatively
fresh
poured
it
painfully
slow
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
yeast
as
per
the
bottle
pours
clear
and
yellow
with
a
nice
head
carbonation
is
great
very
effervescent
crisp
hops
hit
you
first
with
a
clean
finish
an
excellent
pale
ale
that
is
quite
drinkable
no
bad
aftertaste
wish
i
could
taste
it
fresher
id
imagine
itd
naturally
be
hoppier
seems
to
be
a
much
more
well
rounded
beer
compared
to
the
zoe
this
is
a
heck
of
a
pale
ale
it
comes
across
as
a
strongly
dryhopped
apa
in
the
vein
of
those
by
three
floyds
i
really
like
the
variety
in
the
hops
with
a
bunch
of
different
aromas
coming
through
in
nearlyequal
parts
a
fantastic
beer
imo
overall
very
tasty
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
thats
well
balanced
and
easy
to
enjoy
delicious
get
some
o
not
a
bad
pale
ale
at
all
itd
be
even
better
with
some
more
body
as
it
is
the
thinness
prevents
it
from
being
really
great
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
citrusy
pale
ale
very
mild
on
the
bitterness
while
still
displaying
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
and
character
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
drink
i
enjoyed
this
it
was
a
little
old
almost
to
the
end
of
its
best
by
but
still
really
flavorful
a
good
bit
of
spicy
hops
with
a
good
lemon
background
flavor
and
a
good
bite
behind
it
oan
awesome
highly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
pale
ale
its
not
always
available
in
southeast
pa
so
when
i
see
it
i
grab
it
d
dammit
this
stuff
is
dangerously
drinkable
seriously
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
find
it
drink
it
drink
it
fresh
please
poured
into
an

stuck

glue
to

as
it
settled
ever
so
slowly
into

frothy

with

a
toasted

a
easy
drinking
dryer
apa
with
good
hopsmaybe
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
but
still
solid
mbc
brews
have
been
all
the
rage
since
their
start
they
are
quite
expensive
beers
retailing
around
5
per
16
9
ounce
bottle
so
i
generally
do
not
buy
them
however
mbc
beers
often
can
be
sourced
locally
on
tap
for
the
same
price
and
they
are
very
tasty
peeper
is
actually
quite
pale
similar
to
a
lager
the
smell
is
florally
hoppy
dominate
as
is
the
taste
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
as
it
is
a
very
sessionable
and
smooth
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mdfb79
for
this
one
as
a
part
of
the
birthday
bif
enjoyed
this
one
while
watching
my
georgia
tech
yellow
jackets
take
on
the
dawgs
during
rivalry
saturday
served
from
bottle
into
a
coast
willi
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
pine
pine
hop
spice
spicy
hop
grass
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
pine
pine
hop
fruit
hop
earth
earth
hop
and
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
while
this
one
had
a
lot
going
on
in
it
it
really
managed
to
stay
pretty
well
balanced
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
flavor
was
fairly
light
and
crisp
which
made
it
really
easy
to
drink
and
rather
refreshing
really
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
give
this
one
a
try
and
i
hope
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
as
well
o
a
solid
apa
from
a
promising
brewery
very
balanced
and
refreshing
not
my
favorite
from
this
style
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
light
and
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
slow
forming
lacing
behind
fruity
and
sweet
smell
nice
gold
color
with
an
unfiltered
but
sturdy
look
taste
is
unexpectedly
mild
with
quick
receding
fruit
and
honey
and
bitter
flavor
expecting
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
is
surprisingly
light
and
crisp
this
would
be
an
excellent
and
refreshing
ale
for
summer
weather
or
generally
to
quench
your
thirst
o
a
highly
sessionable
great
summertime
apa
seems
almost
clinical
in
its
approach
delicious
refreshing
and
with
any
luck
and
proper
distribution
will
be
one
of
my
gotos
after
the
long
boston
winter
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ever
had
i
shared
it
with
a
friend
at
the
fenix
in
phoenixville
pa
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
with
hints
of
citrus
and
zest
the
fruit
flavors
were
almost
inconspicuous
as
they
blended
nicely
with
the
pale
ale
flavors
and
pinch
of
pepper
its
very
smooth
yet
has
great
carbonation
and
head
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
better
than
this
o
a
great
beer
perfect
for
the
spring
and
summer
time
very
refreshing
o
a
very
nice
pale
ale
the
hop
profile
is
tasty
and
balanced
very
drinkable
i
finished
the
pint
almost
without
realizing
it
simply
put
amazing
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
it
definitely
fits
the
dry
type
of
apa
with
complex
but
subtle
combination
of
hops
and
malt
flavors
beer
tastes
similar
to
the
scent
with
a
well
thought
out
progression
of
flavor
starts
with
a
bready
malt
it
quickly
gives
way
to
a
hoppy
flavor
that
doesnt
slam
your
taste
buds
the
hops
begin
with
a
grapefruit
flavor
and
gives
way
to
a
spicy
piny
sharp
finish
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
all
around
fantastic
beer
great
east
coast
version
of
a
widely
available
style
poured
into
a
wine
glass
with
the
yeast
golden
yellow
with
a
solid
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
excellent
fine
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
a
jazzy
pop
on
the
tongue
smell
is
citrusy
grass
spices
and
some
pine
citrus
is
forward
on
the
flavor
with
other
spices
and
the
mild
flavor
hops
little
malt
presence
this
is
a
great
beer
a
bit
pricy
at
5
99
for
16
9
oz
but
well
worth
a
try
o
this
is
something
i
would
like
to
revisit
in
the
warmer
months
as
it
seems
like
its
a
great
thirst
quencher
i
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
substance
to
it
but
overall
it
is
an
interesting
and
very
drinkable
apa
it
seems
to
me
that
most
american
brewers
even
the
not
so
highly
regarded
ones
have
mastered
the
apa
in
my
experience
its
pretty
tough
to
find
a
really
horrible
apa
from
a
brewer
in
the
states
but
something
like
peeper
shows
you
just
how
bars
can
always
be
raised
o
this
was
a
nice
local
apa
nothing
amazing
but
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
definitely
above
your
average
apa
nice
floral
and
lemon
tones
that
come
out
at
over
5bottle
im
not
sure
if
id
get
this
all
the
time
when
i
can
get
the
same
size
bottles
from
jacks
abby
which
are
almost
half
the
price
i
do
realize
jacks
abby
is
a
little
bit
more
local
i
would
drink
this
again
and
i
recommend
trying
it
out
o
very
tasty
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
very
refreshing
pale
ales
in
general
a
lot
of
them
can
be
kinda
boring
if
you
ask
me
not
this
one
lots
of
bold
flavors
combined
with
a
balanced
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
a
sessionable
brew
with
plenty
to
chew
on
found
on
tap
at
grumpy
doyles
in
reading
ma
this
a
clean
golden
color
with
a
respectable
white
head
and
decent
lacing
served
in
a
tall
stemmed
bowl
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
bread
and
herbal
hop
pleasant
and
delicate
the
flavor
brings
more
bready
wheat
less
skunk
and
more
light
floral
hop
with
a
hint
of
citrus
brightness
its
medium
light
bodied
with
a
delicate
carbonation
and
fresh
feel
very
classy
and
highly
drinkable
overall

i
think
the
world
of
peeper
it
is
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
and
perhaps
only
second
to
hill
farmsteads
edward
pale
ale
craft
beer
drinkers
seek
out
this
beer
for
a
good
reason
because
its
freaking
awesome
anyone
whos
looking
for
a
highly
flavorful
hoppy
beer
thats
mellow
in
the
alcohol
department
5
5
abv
should
pick
up
a
couple
of
bottles
now
o
very
drinkable
but
this
combination
of
flavors
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
fault
in
this
one
though
as
mbc
clearly
put
some
love
into
this
probably
worth
the
effort
to
track
some
of
this
down
even
if
you
only
try
it
once
golden
orange
with
a
voluminous
white
head
great
density
to
it
with
solid
retention
and
lace
fruity
nose
some
mango
and
lighter
fleshed
fruits
some
pine
and
a
gentle
spiciness
similar
on
the
palate
some
tropical
notes
moderate
to
high
bitterness
sweet
gentle
caramelized
flavours
over
pale
malts
light
pinecedar
flavours
similar
to
what
i
get
from
a
red
racer
ipa
lighter
medium
body
low
carbonation
super
drinkable
and
while
pretty
simple
all
around
this
is
something
id
drink
indefinitely
overall
wow
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
that
good
what
an
refreashing
earthy
beer
the
price
was
just
right
too
noticed
that
many
people
were
paying
up
around
710
the
beverage
places
i
have
been
it
had
been
priced
around
45
i
paid
5
for
mine
overall
delicious
a
very
very
sessionable
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
until
the
sediment
came
out
of
the
bottle
then
the
beer
changed
to
more
of
a
grayish
color
the
head
was
white
and
leaves
a
thin
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
malty
aromas
and
some
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
the
flavors
of
lemon
upfront
and
finishes
with
a
malt
base
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
and
a
decent
carbonation
overall
this
beer
wasnt
as
impressive
as
i
expected
it
to
be
it
was
good
but
not
great
in
my
opinion
o
i
should
just
move
up
north
i
could
drink
this
heady
and
gandhi
bot
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
not
need
or
anything
else
the
first
thing
i
think
of
when
i
taste
this
is
fruity
trix
it
has
a
lemony
orange
taste
from
the
hops
with
citrus
zest
and
slightly
herbal
grassy
sweet
tinge
with
mild
pepper
note
in
the
back
with
very
juicy
lemon
and
pepper
type
cohesion
i
loved
this
as
it
was
refreshing
on
a
hot
90
day
and
the
hop
flavor
is
so
fresh
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
only
wished
i
had
tried
this
sooner
drinkability
pretty
solid
i
wonder
how
it
would
have
tasted
fresh
but
at
5
5
abv
i
cant
see
it
would
be
too
onerous
to
toss
one
of
these
back
quicker
in
an
effort
to
intensity
those
flavors
the
procedural
aspects
are
all
spot
on
either
objectively
the
appearance
or
in
context
the
mouthfeel
and
this
is
one
id
love
to
try
on
tap
during
a
hot
summer
day
in
virginia
does
maine
get
this
hot
overall
this
was
an
extremely
tasty
pale
ale
and
highly
drinkable
it
was
so
good
that
i
had
4
of
them
in
one
sitting
so
this
was
a
session
beer
for
me
and
one
i
highly
recommend
a
great
beer
thats
in
the
same
class
as
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
overall
really
love
drinking
maine
beer
companys
offerings
this
is
my
third
maine
beer
company
brew
that
i
have
been
fortunate
to
try
but
its
not
the
best
zoe
is
still
the
best
and
zoe
is
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
medium
full
body
decent
carbonation
drinks
really
nicely
with
a
refreshing
cooling
feel
this
is
one
of
the
better
apas
out
there
right
now
along
with
daisy
cutter
edward
and
zombie
dust
o
great
beer
in
every
aspect
love
what
the
brewery
represents
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
in
the
future
comes
recommended
incredible
structure
to
the
white
head
on
this
it
leaves
shelves
of
lacing
behind
as
it
chases
the
clear
amber
beer
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
right
away
you
get
the
hops
in
the
nose
very
juicy
with
ripe
citrus
with
an
underpinning
of
pine
and
some
cracker
for
substance
the
hop
profile
in
the
taste
is
a
little
different
starting
off
with
fresh
pine
with
the
citrus
backed
off
a
bunch
and
then
a
tropical
essence
coming
through
in
the
wash
the
malts
dont
come
off
as
sweet
in
the
taste
but
are
more
forceful
in
their
biscuity
flavor
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
giving
it
a
crisp
snap
on
the
first
sip
and
id
call
this
beer
refreshing
if
not
for
the
long
bitter
aftertaste
excellent
effort
from
down
east
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
brewery
out
of
portland
mild
easy
drinking
hoppy
beer
a
nice
citrus
taste
amarillo
cascade
and
centennial
foamy
head
lacey
could
not
finish
the
entire
bottle
with
john
but
i
kept
the
rest
for
cooking
middling
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
more
aroma
would
help
the
experience
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
is
quite
amazing
with
light
sweet
cereal
notes
also
detectable
taste
is
a
superb
mix
between
some
floral
hops
notes
mix
in
with
some
notes
of
light
cereal
mix
of
citrus
and
floral
hoppy
notes
is
just
about
perfect
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
guess
the
east
coast
breweries
are
not
catching
up
on
west
coast
brewery
about
adding
hops
into
beer
being
more
then
just
about
bitterness
o
i
really
like
this
brew
my
first
from
the
maine
beer
folks
and
an
unexpected
treat
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
with
an
intense
foamy
white
head
that
kept
its
integrity
throughout
drinking
the
nose
definitely
screams
hops
but
no
specific
notes
in
particular
i
think
the
beer
leaned
more
towards
citrusy
hops
but
it
wasnt
like
a
tropical
fruit
storm
in
your
nose
the
taste
was
similar
and
although
the
beer
thoroughly
bathed
your
palate
in
bitter
hoppiness
it
wasnt
unpleasant
it
was
highly
drinkable
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
about
this
beer
considering
how
easily
it
went
down
this
beer
is
great
and
definitely
worth
trying
although
bottles
arent
easily
available
on
shelves
still
overall
not
a
very
satisfying
beer
for
me
not
terribly
offensive
better
the
second
time
around
the
first
time
was
almost
undrinkable
but
for
nine
dollars
certainly
not
a
bargain
by
any
means
regardless
i
am
still
looking
forward
to
lunch
o
a
solid
beer
not
overwhelmingly
awesome
but
definitely
good
o
this
is
the
beer
you
want
on
a
hot
day
a
very
refreshing
brew
but
damn
do
i
want
this
to
be
an
ipa
so
very
badly
but
thats
what
lunch
is
for
as
a
pale
ale
its
pretty
good
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
is
the
way
beer
was
meant
to
be
fresh
and
alive
it
has
so
much
more
character
when
its
conditioned
properly
i
also
have
a
fresh
bottle
just
a
few
weeks
old
there
are
so
many
subtle
nuances
to
it
that
it
really
keeps
you
interested
throughout
the
entire
serving
and
it
doesnt
hurt
that
its
remarkably
wellbalanced
and
superbly
drinkable
impeccably
brewed
i
havent
had
a
beer
thats
excited
me
so
much
in
years
literally
and
for
it
to
be
simply
an
american
pale
ale
and
not
something
exotic
really
says
something
absolutely
delicious
overall
based
on
the
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
in
all
aspects
i
felt
like
it
was
a
bit
watereddown
i
am
a
big
fan
of
drinkable
beers
but
not
at
the
sacrifice
of
flavor
hoping
the
bottle
of
lunch
i
picked
up
is
more
enjoyable
notes
consumed
on
562012
at
house
of
1000
beers
o
nice
pale
ale
more
of
a
mild
pale
with
the
hops
being
a
little
more
subdue
compared
to
the
style
o
very
refreshing
and
tasty
apa
a
good
hoppy
brew
and
the
crispness
and
drinakability
make
it
a
perfect
summer
sessioner
o
very
nice
beer
well
crafted
and
delicious
at
8
per
bottle
its
a
steep
price
so
i
wont
be
buying
again
but
it
was
worth
it
once
cloudy
unfiltered
light
brown
equals
not
that
appetizing
very
light
on
the
aroma
spice
earth
some
grapefruit
but
very
mild
this
is
less
than
a
month
old
flavor
is
very
muted
slightly
bitter
and
very
watery
taste
with
little
hop
bite
not
the
best
go
with
a
fresh
lunch
instead
7
is
a
lot
for
this
beer
a
plethora
of
alternatives
o
im
liking
the
hops
in
peeper
a
lot
better
than
mo
great
hop
profile
with
only
a
little
bitterness
o
again
quite
complex
fairly
fairly
easy
to
drink
overall
perfectly
average
for
sure
a
drinkable
light
apa
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
a
great
sessionable
pale
ale
that
would
have
even
a
antihopper
excited
had
this
on
tap
at
pony
bar
in
nyc
and
this
is
an
absolute
must
have
worthy
of
seeking
out
on
tap
up
front
it
has
a
citrusy
bite
to
it
peaks
to
a
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
not
unlike
pliny
and
finishes
sweet
but
not
crazy
sweet
not
the
most
balanced
pale
ale
but
if
you
enjoy
your
hops
its
a
real
joy
to
drink
love
maines
stuff
cant
wait
to
have
more
from
them
east
coast
pas
all
day
baby
coming
out
of
the
bottle
peeper
looks
the
color
of
a
berliner
weisse
appearing
whitishgolden
gliding
in
the
glass
a
dirty
looking
amberish
orange
that
cleans
up
when
the
whole
bottle
is
poured
leaving
a
dirty
bronze
color
and
white
foam
all
around
the
glass
smell
is
very
fresh
20
days
old
with
bright
citrusy
hops
with
some
faint
pine
and
some
sweet
backing
malt
but
not
much
a
very
pleasant
smeller
taste
is
str8
up
pale
ale
with
big
citrus
taste
and
a
light
body
pale
is
the
word
feel
is
light
as
mentionedwith
a
nice
hop
bite
that
comes
and
goes
at
5
5
if
this
came
in
6
packs
this
would
be
a
no
brainer
overall
worth
trying
on
the
warm
side
o
an
excellent
choice
of
a
beer
good
for
style
and
good
for
me
however
this
could
be
close
to
an
aipa
overall
a
wonderful
pale
ale
that
would
surely
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
locally
this
is
yet
another
spectacular
brew
from
mbc
poured
into
a
victory
shaker
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
that
retained
and
laced
well
light
crisp
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malts
crisp
clean
taste
honeysweet
malts
grassy
pithy
orange
and
lemon
notes
yet
not
very
bitter
at
all
in
fact
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
light
in
body
yet
full
of
flavor
in
perfect
balance
for
the
style
almost
too
drinkable
if
that
were
possible
very
nice
beer
overall
and
along
with
their
lunch
ipa
really
puts
mbc
on
the
map
a
damn
fine
pale
ale
disguised
as
an
ipa
i
really
enjoyed
this
an
extremely
well
crafted
delicate
balanced
brew
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
little
bit
and
leaves
some
lace
nose
is
crisp
and
clean
scents
of
citrusy
hops
flowery
hops
and
grassyearthy
hops
meld
with
a
crackery
mildly
sweet
toasty
breadlike
malt
character
taste
is
all
about
balance
the
earthy
grassy
orangey
hop
character
harmonizes
with
the
crackertoast
qualities
of
the
malt
and
it
seems
effortless
like
it
was
meant
to
be
crisp
dry
smooth
medium
body
balance
throughout
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
back
end
as
well
as
a
taste
of
pepper
and
what
seems
maybe
to
be
a
slight
yeasty
note
another
very
well
done
refined
beer
from
maine
beer
o
its
a
good
beer
not
blown
away
but
an
aboveaverage
apa
overall
is
fantastic
love
this
beer
and
its
readily
available
around
here
the
only
problem
is
the
5
49
price
d
very
drinkable
nice
balanced
american
pale
ale
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
malt
profile
that
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
hops
pours
a
pale
lemonade
shaded
yellow
with
an
absolutely
huge
bright
white
head
leaves
huge
chunks
of
lace
on
the
glass
nice
clean
crisp
hoppy
aroma
grapefruit
lemon
zest
honeydew
and
a
bit
grassy
just
a
perfect
flavor
profile
for
the
style
light
crisp
fresh
clean
extremely
drinkable
but
packs
a
huge
punch
nice
citrus
zesty
start
mixed
in
with
some
sweeter
citrus
notes
as
well
a
simple
sweet
malt
backbone
before
a
clean
semibitter
grassy
and
piney
finish
bring
the
beer
full
circle
finishes
dry
and
clean
but
doesnt
leave
your
mouth
dry
even
so
you
absolutely
need
to
take
another
sip
flawless
cohesion
of
the
flavor
profile
moves
on
from
one
note
to
another
perfectly
just
so
well
done
that
describing
the
flavors
doesnt
do
the
beer
justice
its
just
perfectly
crafted
for
the
style
without
question
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
o
solid
pale
id
get
it
again
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
definitely
recommended
and
will
drink
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
bright
lemon
yellow
coloring
with
a
thin
uneven
filmy
white
covering
aromas
are
lemon
and
grapefruit
citrus
with
some
subtle
dry
spicy
hops
flavors
are
tangy
and
peppery
with
a
more
blended
citrus
component
of
lemon
orange
and
grapefruit
to
balance
the
green
robust
and
peppery
hops
bitter
backbone
is
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
and
the
body
remains
light
and
crisp
with
a
steady
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
citrus
sweet
almost
effervescent
with
the
resiny
bitter
hops
cleaning
the
palate
crisp
slightly
drying
finish
cleans
the
palate
completely
in
between
drinks
refreshing
decent
brew
and
apa
but
not
one
i
would
go
to
maybe
better
on
tap
or
fresh
o
very
tasty
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
having
many
more
assuming
that
i
am
able
to
continue
to
find
it
at
the
local
bottle
shops
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
very
refreshing
d
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
ale
that
is
loaded
with
character
and
flavor
there
are
lots
of
good
things
going
on
with
the
maine
beer
company
offering
another
great
beer
from
maine
beer
co
and
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
lunch
or
zoe
again
sometime
soon
wow
what
a
wonderful
pale
ale
i
had
been
sitting
on
this
for
awhile
but
should
have
had
it
sooner
superbowl
sunday
is
the
day
and
it
lives
up
to
hype
the
game
was
unable
to
achieve
it
pours
a
vibrant
golden
color
and
leave
a
bit
of
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
sessionable
ale
and
i
see
myself
have
a
few
of
these
this
summer
for
a
treat
looking
forward
to
trying
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
there
is
a
finger
of
white
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
good
retention
and
it
leaves
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
behind
clinging
to
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
pale
malt
to
it
there
is
a
pretty
big
citrus
aroma
that
comes
out
right
away
there
are
some
aromas
of
fruit
and
it
also
has
a
nice
hop
presence
to
it
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
pale
malt
and
a
nice
bit
of
citrus
there
is
a
really
nice
hop
presence
that
comes
through
and
adds
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
there
is
a
little
bit
of
tropical
fruit
flavor
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
a
toasted
malt
flavor
as
well
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
citrus
and
hop
bitterness
behind
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
it
has
a
really
nice
feel
to
it
it
starts
out
with
some
subtle
malt
sweetness
and
fruitiness
then
there
is
a
nice
bit
go
citrus
and
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
behind
in
the
finish
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
has
a
really
nice
flavor
and
it
is
just
a
really
easy
going
beer
overall
i
think
it
is
a
great
beer
as
well
as
a
great
representation
of
the
style
the
hop
presence
here
is
wonderful
for
a
pale
ale
as
is
the
citrus
flavor
i
just
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
recommend
trying
it
out
overall
this
is
what
an
apa
should
be
amazingly
balanced
clear
crisp
aromas
and
flavours
everything
is
how
it
should
be
d
so
refreshing
and
just
what
i
wanted
in
a
pale
ale
very
balanced
and
goes
a
step
above
for
this
style
so
clean
and
fresh
this
should
be
sought
out
o
a
well
crafted
drinkable
apa
the
flavor
and
look
of
this
one
are
somewhat
unique
but
unless
i
saw
a
fresh
case
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottled
date
122012
pours
a
yellow
orange
with
a
3
inch
white
fluffy
head
that
laces
the
glass
amazingly
smell
is
earthy
grass
pineapple
lemon
and
apricot

like
that
lemon
grass
and
apricot
dominate
body
is
good
size
for
the
abv
lots
of
life
lush
and
great
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
overall
very
good
beer
this
will
be
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
very
hot
day
in
the
summer
good
refreshing
beer
this
would
pair
great
with
some
spicy
food
happy
i
picked
this
one
up
i
will
be
picking
this
one
up
next
trip
do
this
one
surprised
me
not
quite
on
the
level
of
daisy
cutter
but
ranks
very
high
in
my
book
for
an
apa
thanks
for
to
pete27lax
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
the
brew
is
goo
well
made
apa
that
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
and
more
refreshing
side
excellent
intro
beer
for
some
people
looking
to
experience
a
hoppier
selection
with
out
destroying
the
palette
oone
of
the
better
apas
with
nice
balance
and
flavor
d
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
definitely
a
freshness
issue
however
still
good
after
many
a
month
i
can
only
imagine
a
fresh
peeper
overall
really
like
what
mbc
has
done
here
some
nice
twists
and
turns
throughout
the
experience
would
recommend
this
overall
its
a
good
beer
a
little
different
than
most
pale
ales
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
apas
i
have
tried
light
enough
to
session
and
delicious
enough
to
enjoy
all
day
maine
beer
company
has
pleased
me
once
again
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
and
a
nice
introduction
to
the
maine
beer
company
overall
an
easy
drinking
pale
that
was
solid
but
unspectacular
this
sort
to
bummed
me
out
a
bit
as
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
maybe
im
used
the
more
malt
and
body
from
drinking
mostly
ipas
lately
thus
this
felt
thin
i
dont
know
but
for
sure
ill
try
it
again
some
time
o
this
is
actually
quite
good
and
i
bet
if
it
were
fresh
it
would
be
phenomenal
o
extremely
easy
drinking
the
hop
profile
is
right
on
outstanding
apa
im
so
glad
i
tried
this
again
i
now
want
to
try
more
maine
beer
company
beers
now
if
you
can
get
it
give
peeper
a
try
just
dont
forget
about
it
4
5
o
this
is
more
of
a
sour
than
an
apa
in
my
opinion
and
not
a
very
good
one
at
that
taste
light
on
its
feet
pleasant
decent
enough
hopping
cascade
i
suspect
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
on
the
east
coast
probably
the
best
wouldnt
say
theres
any
caramel
tones
its
really
a
palexpa
that
delivers
on
the
pale
i
nice
light
taudry
affair
this
pepper
ale
is
poured
entire
bottle
into
large
pilsner
glass
getting
a
murky
diarrhea
color
and
a
finger
of
bleached
cotton
white
head
with
a
careful
pour
nose
is
pure
grapefruit
and
pine
with
a
passing
sweet
malt
a
beautiful
snow
cap
of
head
remains
after
5
minutes
malts
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
taste
is
bitter
hops
some
citrus
not
getting
any
malt
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
medium
so
the
malts
must
be
at
work
but
the
flavor
is
carefully
concealed
by
the
delicious
hops
at
5
5
i
would
session
the
living
snot
out
of
this
beer
if
it
were
more
readily
available
love
love
love
this
beer
bottom
line
is
that
it
is
delicious
and
i
want
more
tasty
pale
ale
but
could
use
some
more
hops
in
the
nose
and
the
bodys
a
bit
thin
and
watery
o
very
flavorful
and
wellbalanced
its
a
little
pricey
here
in
pa
but
its
a
very
green
company
with
1
going
to
environmental
nonprofits
its
certainly
good
enough
for
me
to
seek
it
out
again
and
look
for
other
beers
from
this
company
tip
of
the
hat
to
matt
capone
for
turning
me
on
to
this
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
ale
with
a
kaleidoscope
of
hop
flavor
and
scent
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
beer
from
maine
beer
company
picked
up
a
couple
bottles
in
portland
this
past
summer
pours
crystal
clear
almost
a
pils
color
with
a
nice
sustained
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
beautiful
fruity
scents
the
beer
is
balanced
for
bitterness
with
a
citrusy
hop
profile
leave
a
lacy
print
of
the
glass
it
goes
down
cleanly
so
easy
to
drink
that
it
is
scary
and
is
never
cloying
an
excellent
beer
that
is
excellent
o
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
its
the
second
from
maine
beer
co
ive
had
this
week
both
have
wowed
me
for
a
pale
ale
this
was
different
than
most
ive
ever
had
before
far
exceeds
my
expectations
of
what
a
pale
ale
should
deliver
overall
this
beer
is
one
that
ill
be
certain
to
look
for
the
next
time
im
at
the
packie
this
reminds
me
of
a
professional
really
good
version
of
a
single
malt
single
hop
pale
ale
i
made
last
year
with
simply
american
2row
and
cascade
hop
pellets
the
hops
are
fresh
here
and
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
m
whats
there
not
to
like
crisp
hops
that
leave
plenty
of
citrus
behind
balancing
biscuit
a
small
alcohol
price
tag
a
very
well
done
ale
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
though
m
smooth
with
little
carbonation
fantastic
maltiness
lingers
on
the
palate
one
of
the
finer
pas
ive
had
verdict
lovely
pale
ale
from
maine
beer
company
its
my
first
beer
from
them
and
i
must
say
it
hit
the
mark
cant
wait
to
try
their
zoe
and
lunch
try
this
if
you
see
it
overall
its
a
nice
drink
but
im
not
impressed
i
bought
it
because
i
thought
that
the
label
said
pepper
not
peeper
a
little
disappointing
in
that
respect
many
thanks
to
shanepb
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
i
am
loving
the
appearance
of
this
bottle
very
pteesque

simplistic
label
very

maine
has
really
impressed
me
so
far
now
i
just
need
to
get
my
hands
on
some
lunch
o
great
pale
ale
made
me
wish
it
was
summer
so
i
can
could
drink
a
glass
on
the
deck
manning
the
grill
overall
a
very
sessionable
refreshing
ale
ive
recently
been
on
a
big
beer
kick
so
this
one
was
a
great
change
of
pace
looking
forward
to
trying
others
from
mbc
o
a
very
nice
pale
ale
that
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got
to
try
really
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
these
guys
bold
aromatics
with
floral
and
citrus
notes
really
sticking
out
here
caramel
malts
are
nice
and
sweet
and
balance
out
the
pungent
hop
bouquet
taste
is
an
upfront
hop
attack
quite
bold
for
an
apa
sweet
malts
balance
out
nicely
with
a
bready
or
biscuit
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
around
the
edges
overall
a
well
made
beer
with
a
pleasing
look
and
agood
taste
i
look
forward
to
simpling
other
products
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
o
fantastic
very
simple
ale
but
worthy
of
accolades
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
delicious
beer
it
was
a
pleasure
drinking
it
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
full
of
delicious
flavors
sure
to
please
both
craft
and
casual
beer
drinkers
alike
the
aftertaste
might
be
slightly
too
heavy
on
the
bitter
hops
but
the
main
mouthful
is
pleasing
and
delicious
going
down
smooth
and
the
delightful
fruit
flavors
remain
even
after
several
mouthfuls
recommended
full
and
even
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
that
is
initially
soft
but
finishes
tingly
thanks
again
chris
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
smooth
feel
that
contains
a
light
level
of
carbonation
well
balanced
crisp
and
very
easy
drinking
more
hop
favoring
than
bitterness
which
is
very
enjoyable
and
made
this
brew
really
stand
out
for
me
i
would
have
no
problems
throwing
a
couple
of
these
back
if
given
the
opportunity
big
thumbs
up
here
glad
to
see
this
brewery
on
our
shelves
in
pa
now
this
beer
is
a
darker
shade
of
hazy
orange
with
a
big
white
fluffy
head
that
recedes
to
a
nice
film
on
the
top
leaving
a
little
bit
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
citrus
forward
with
oranges
and
grapefruit
at
the
forefront
there
is
also
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
maybe
swinging
a
bit
farther
to
the
sweet
malty
side
than
i
would
usually
prefer
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
and
lots
of
grapefruit
citrus
hops
along
with
a
big
malty
caramel
backbone
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
very
nice
carbonation
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
pleasant
beer
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
try
a
bottle
thanks
ciachef1212
overall
this
has
a
greater
hop
profile
which
i
prefer
than
most
apas
a
more
balanced
apa
is
a
good
thing
too
though
this
is
a
very
nice
apa
worth
trying
d
had
higher
hopes
still
pretty
tasty
beer
o
i
enjoyed
peeper
numerous
times
this
summer
and
know
that
this
bottle
was
quite
muted
by
its
age
will
taste
again
with
fresh
bottle
next
summer
90100
o
a
nicely
crafted
light
crisp
and
slightly
more
hopcentric
pale
blonde
ale
than
true
apa
although
id
like
a
little
more
malt
character
and
body
this
is
a
nice
springsummer
apa
or
palate
cleanser
at
a
very
quaffable
5
5
abv
id
get
it
again
in
the
spring
o
a
very
fresh
tasting
pale
ale
with
a
strong
floral
hop
character
with
malt
depth
without
much
sweetness
tasty
refreshing
balanced
and
not
overly
aggressive
as
id
expect
from
a
top
tier
pale
ale
pours
a
bright
and
lightly
hazed
golden
amber
fantastic
dense
cap
of
froth
great
sticky
rings
of
lacing
around
the
glass
scent
brings
a
great
combination
of
hops
equal
parts
floral
and
spicy
backed
by
grapefruit
and
pine
notes
malts
are
light
but
give
off
a
fresh
bready
and
lightly
sweet
profile
taste
again
is
hop
forward
very
unique
blend
which
again
has
floral
and
spicy
notes
before
the
more
familiar
for
the
style
grapefruit
and
pine
pop
up
malts
are
quite
light
in
flavor
and
body
and
are
lightly
sweet
medium
bodied
lacking
a
bit
in
heft
and
quite
bubbly
and
dry
a
very
good
apa
o
another
great
main
offering
a
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
brew
it
is
hard
to
put
this
down
once
you
start
drinking
it
so
many
apas
try
to
be
ipas
this
one
doesnt
rather
it
stays
true
to
style
and
does
an
excellent
job
of
exemplifying
the
style
not
sure
how
well
distributed
this
is
but
if
you
can
get
your
mitts
on
one
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
with
slight
alcolhol
vapors
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
taste
a
bit
hoppy
for
an
apa
more
like
an
ipa
but
its
truly
delicious
malty
hops
with
a
touch
of
fruit
undertones
its
a
great
great
brew
easy
drinker
but
filled
with
taste
this
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
a
nice
beer
with
a
light
mouthfeel
with
no
big
citrus
hops
in
most
other
pales
very
unique
and
think
this
would
be
a
great
warm
weather
beer

medium
body
very
chewy
and
silky
moderate
carbonation
an
outstanding
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
overall
a
solid
brew
that
could
easily
be
shared
or
consumed
as
a
session
beer
im
happy
to
have
tried
something
from
a
small
producer
in
maine
o
a
great
brew
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
have
seen
here
great
taste
and
yet
so
clean
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
the
maine
beer
co
d
really
easy
to
drink
this
has
held
up
surprisingly
well
considering
its
nearly
three
months
old
id
really
like
to
try
this
closer
to
the
source
but
i
liked
it
in
its
current
state
quite
a
bit
the
taste
is
not
a
letdown
a
soft
carbontion
reveals
a
fresh
fresh
hop
flavor
not
bitter
and
not
overwhelming
perfect
the
malt
is
present
but
never
to
much
very
nice
pours
a
dark
straw
yellow
with
an
ample
white
head
the
nose
is
dry
and
biscuity
a
bit
hoppy
and
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
rather
odd
actually
theres
a
very
dry
hoppiness
and
again
a
bit
of
biscuit
malt
theres
a
bit
of
graininess
the
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
leaves
a
substantial
amount
of
dry
bitterness
on
the
tongue
some
of
which
is
unpleasant
good
carbonation
certainly
this
has
more
impact
than
a
normal
pale
ale
but
it
doesnt
really
work
for
me
dry
and
sterile
almost
medicinal
hoppiness
with
only
a
hint
of
biscuity
malt
sweetness
doesnt
balance
in
my
eyes
the
taste
here
is
lightly
hoppy
almost
like
a
weak
ipa
it
really
pops
on
the
tongue
also
rather
effervescent
it
almost
has
the
characteristics
of
a
hoppy
champagne
definitely
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
the
hype
i
have
heard
about
this
beer
is
well
worth
it
if
you
can
find
it
definitely
pick
it
up
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
nothing
to
crazy
going
on
but
a
nice
old
school
taste
and
feel
throughout
the
imbibing
experience
after
having
zoe
honestly
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
solid
but
would
prefer
a
little
less
malt
for
the
style
and
nothing
overly
special
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
brownish
tint
lots
of
foamy
white
head
really
not
a
pretty
beer
at
all
smells
hoppy
but
in
a
really
enjoyable
way
lemon
and
fresh
grass
on
the
nose
tastes
bitter
and
lemony
im
not
sure
if
there
is
actual
lemon
zest
or
something
in
this
but
the
bitterness
seems
to
be
from
something
other
than
the
hops
maybe
im
wrong
feels
strong
for
5
5
percent
the
carbonation
is
great
though
and
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
that
balances
the
bitter
overall
decent
it
grows
on
me
as
i
drink
it
but
not
something
that
stands
out
to
me
as
a
favourite
md
light
to
medium
body
carbonation
is
slightly
high
but
overall
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
excellent
drinkability
although
the
bitterness
was
slightly
off
balance
for
me
i
know
many
people
would
feel
it
isnt
high
enough
a
really
good
drinking
beer
o
really
a
solid
pale
ale
so
far
ive
been
impressed
with
the
maine
beer
co
offerings
ive
tried
like
lunch
and
zoe
the
focus
here
seems
to
be
on
balance
and
quality
rather
than
something
that
could
be
described
as
exciting
many
props
to
maine
beer
co
for
this
peeper
is
certainly
not
mindblowing
but
its
remarkably
welldone
o
i
can
practically
visualize
the
tipping
of
their
brewer
caps
towards
the
west
coast
hoppy
styles
while
giving
it
a
local
twist
for
my
first
maine
beer
co
beer
this
was
exceptional
i
really
cant
wait
to
give
more
of
their
beers
a
swirl
as
i
would
rank
this
among
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
id
love
to
have
this
super
fresh
for
a
bigger
swing
in
the
flavor
transition
i
love
when
i
get
a
beer
at
this
abv
that
drinks
like
a
fine
ipa
nothing
is
overwhelming
about
this
pale
ale
its
also
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
pale
ales
very
pleasant
and
gulpable
brew
pours
a
hazy
golden
pale
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
twofinger
plus
creamy
white
head
and
leaves
a
very
nice
thick
creamy
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
some
nice
malt
notes
citrus
note
the
taste
is
hoppy
slightly
sweet
little
malt
note
nice
little
touch
of
citrus
medium
body
with
a
very
nice
drybitter
finish
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
im
liking
what
ive
had
so
far
from
this
brewery
thanks
bill
overall
this
is
a
perfect
pale
ale
nice
mild
sweet
pale
malt
backbone
for
ample
citrus
and
pine
hops
a
great
pale
ale
is
hard
to
master
but
maine
brewing
has
it
down
highly
recommended
overall
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
i
think
i
would
prefer
it
as
an
ipa
with
the
same
hop
profile
but
a
very
good
pale
ale
o
i
only
have
great
things
to
say
about
this
beer
zombie
dust
is
still
the
better
pale
ale
but
this
is
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
for
ibu
flavor
and
overall
profile
which
i
respect
love
this
beer
and
would
kill
for
this
in
local
market
definitely
gonna
make
me
seek
out
lunch
now
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
apa
hops
are
well
featured
but
not
overdone
malts
are
there
and
are
subtle
i
am
not
disappointed
by
any
of
these
maine
beer
co
brews
o
i
wish
i
would
have
been
able
to
consume
the
whole
bottle
this
was
a
refreshing
hoppy
yet
balanced
pale
ale
this
was
a
great
way
to
start
my
day
thanks
deuane
o
a
nice
beer
when
you
want
hops
but
dont
very
drinlable
overall
well
this
needs
to
come
at
6
packs
in
at
a
cheaper
price
because
its
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
tasty
american
pale
that
really
resembles
an
ipa
at
points
props
on
the
hops
pours
a
lovely
hazy
orangishgold
with
a
very
generous
three
finger
crown
that
clings
to
every
single
bit
of
glass
it
can
as
it
recedes
down
the
depths
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
subtle
light
hops
with
some
real
nice
and
balanced
citrus
notes
unlike
some
other
apas
ive
had
this
doesnt
try
to
pose
as
an
ipa
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
with
some
light
hops
and
a
nice
upfront
citrus
profile
this
is
so
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
it
leaves
the
tongue
with
a
tinge
of
creaminess
and
some
lingering
citrus
its
not
at
all
bitter
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
the
epitome
of
the
type
of
beer
that
i
could
drink
regularly
without
ever
tiring
next
lunch
overall
an
outstanding
apa
one
of
the
best
ive
had
highly
recommended
this
is
a
really
hoppy
smelling
but
easy
tasting
pale
ale
the
hop
character
comes
through
strong
in
the
nose
but
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
mellow
the
finish
is
light
along
with
the
body
of
the
beer
this
is
an
ipa
in
a
pale
ales
body
an
it
works
suprisingly
well
great
beer
from
the
northeast
overall
peeper
may
be
the
only
pale
ale
that
i
have
had
to
date
that
i
enjoy
it
is
an
excellent
beer
on
all
fronts
this
beer
exceeded
all
of
my
expectations
and
that
is
not
something
that
happens
too
often
this
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
gold
color
with
a
huge
meringue
like
white
head
of
small
bubbles
the
head
retained
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
nice
lacing
was
left
behind
the
nose
is
delightfully
citric
with
bits
of
orange
tangerine
lime
yeast
and
dust
the
taste
is
pleasantly
mild
and
bitter
with
soft
floral
notes
citrus
peel
and
orvalesque
yeast
notes
light
to
medium
in
body
with
very
high
aggressive
carbonation
so
aggressive
in
fact
it
takes
away
some
of
the
subtleties
of
this
beer
it
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
certainly
recommend
and
wish
i
had
greater
access
too
overall
this
is
the
hoppiest
pale
ale
ive
ever
hadbites
like
an
ipa
and
thats
a
great
thing
these
guys
did
a
great
job
with
this
brew
o
really
a
great
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
wish
i
had
another
right
now
even
though
this
is
nearly
5
months
old
i
think
its
very
fresh
tasting
o
a
truly
nice
and
refreshing
ale
that
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
florida
summer
day
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
and
manages
to
bring
the
hops
without
crossing
over
the
ipa
line
the
look
alone
puts
this
among
my
recent
favorites
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
the
smell
is
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
almost
no
malt
presence
the
flavor
is
hoppy
and
the
flavor
pops
in
your
mouth
with
citrus
piney
and
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
and
carbonated
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
avilable
second
to
edaward
and
up
there
with
alpha
king
mmmm
its
a
bright
crisp
pale
ale
with
a
herbal
pine
and
lemon
and
then
a
clean
juicy
grapefruit
finish
the
bitterness
approaches
an
ipa
and
probably
surpasses
a
few
lesser
one
but
the
body
still
on
the
more
drinkable
side
of
the
style
its
certainly
lighter
than
snpa
for
example
id
love
to
take
care
of
a
few
bottles
of
this
so
it
goes
with
the
taste
its
a
great
flavor
but
not
quite
apa
style
im
being
picky
some
floral
and
overripe
apple
citrus
green
pine
nice
bite
to
it
crisp
and
clean
easily
quaffable
at
5
5
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
have
as
a
regular
drink
its
a
mowing
the
lawn
beer
after
a
hard
day
of
work
i
would
pop
this
brew
open
to
refresh
myself
and
relax
while
i
watch
an
arsenal
game
which
is
an
oxymoron
because
if
you
watch
arsenal
play
its
hardly
relaxing
at
all
but
i
digress
this
beer
is
great
it
has
a
respectable
drinkability
that
would
put
commercial
beers
to
shame
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
clearish
straw
color
with
a
dirty
white
head
started
off
with
about
2
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
layer
it
clung
fairly
well
aroma
was
a
fruity
sweet
with
a
delicate
hop
undertone
reminded
me
of
a
fresh
melon
taste
was
smooth
and
fairly
clean
slightly
flowery
once
again
seemed
to
finish
as
a
clean
melon
flavor
nice
and
delicate
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
seemed
a
tad
over
carbonated
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
coated
nicely
for
the
style
overall
a
pretty
awesome
beer
not
my
style
of
choice
but
a
very
nice
well
balanced
palette
pleaser
d
very
drinkable
and
certainly
a
sessionable
albeit
a
bit
pricey
pale
ale
good
things
are
happening
on
industrial
way
in
portland
me
cheers
o
ive
had
two
beers
from
maine
beer
company
now
and
no
doubt
in
my
mind
they
are
the
alpine
of
the
east
coast
ive
come
to
love
beer
through
the
company
of
my
brother
so
i
was
charmed
by
the
story
of
their
brewery
too
rock
on
guys
if
your
beer
is
this
good
after
being
bottled
and
sent
to
me
8
days
through
the
heat
in
a
truck
i
cant
even
imagine
how
good
it
is
at
the
source
figured
id
give
this
a
try
heard
good
things
about
it
poured
into
my
df
head
pint
glass
one
finger
white
kinda
rocky
head
amber
gold
color
that
is
rather
transparent
sheeting
along
the
side
of
the
glass
i
sip
from
the
aroma
is
of
malts
married
with
slightly
citrusy
hops
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
too
the
flavor
is
more
pale
ale
then
many
pale
ales
ive
head
that
is
to
say
balance
balance
of
bitter
and
malty
biscuit
like
quality
a
bit
of
citrus
and
grass
makes
an
apperance
in
the
flavor
clean
plan
yeast
flavor
a
bitter
and
clean
finish
what
more
is
there
to
say
well
carbed
round
mouthfeel
a
good
pale
ale
period
nothing
about
this
beer
is
average
or
above
average
its
good
period
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
is
significantly
more
westcoastlike
than
most
ive
had
from
the
ne
area
well
worth
a
shot
a
tad
dry
but
not
completely
highly
carbonated
but
really
smooth
and
a
nice
mediumlight
body
make
this
a
nice
beer
quite
quaffable
and
almost
sessionable
if
only
i
could
buy
this
locally
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
its
definitely
a
good
choice
during
the
summer
months
pours
a
hazy
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
aroma
is
of
fresh
grassy
hops
with
some
secondary
herbal
spicy
and
bready
notes
this
pale
ale
is
hopforward
with
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
which
leaves
the
finish
slightly
sweet
with
a
balancing
bitterness
notes
of
mint
and
black
tea
linger
in
the
finish
its
fairly
fullbodied
with
a
great
creaminess
carbonation
is
spoton
overall
a
beefedup
pale
ale
an
excellent
apa
perfect
for
hot
summer
day
o
this
is
an
apa
i
would
not
hesitate
to
revisit
it
is
just
a
really
solid
all
around
beer
there
is
a
also
grains
coming
through
pepper
and
grass
mf
if
fairly
light
with
a
good
balance
to
it
it
is
a
fairly
sweet
apa
but
not
too
much
so
if
you
have
not
tried
this
already
and
come
across
pick
it
up
light
bodied
with
some
decent
carbonation
to
keep
the
beer
refreshing
solid
session
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
better
than
average
pale
ale
but
not
my
ideal
i
certainly
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
but
wont
be
on
the
lookout
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
in
this
day
where
only
big
burn
your
mouth
ipas
or
roast
you
out
stouts
are
getting
big
love
it
is
great
to
find
a
beer
like
this
very
impressed
o
a
very
drinkable
apa
excellent
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
simply
an
awesome
summer
beer
it
pours
a
nice
honey
color
with
the
perfect
size
head
the
taste
is
right
on
and
there
is
a
pleasant
herbal
after
taste
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
herbal
undertones
this
smell
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
this
is
definitely
going
to
make
me
try
more
from
the
maine
beer
company
well
done
very
drinkable
nice
for
summer
time
a
very
good
apa
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
the
yeast
is
a
bit
chalky
which
is
the
beers
only
down
point
glad
i
found
this
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
orange
and
lemon
with
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
a
nice
bready
malt
balanced
with
the
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
great
drinker
i
look
forward
to
more
from
maine
beer
co
overall
a
nice
beer
definitely
will
try
more
of
their
other
offerings
its
hard
to
complain
although
slightly
more
than
id
rather
pay
for
something
that
is
just
good
its
how
this
style
should
be
but
nothing
special
while
it
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
more
famous
ipas
of
late
the
ale
had
an
an
unusual
power
of
staying
on
target
with
its
taste
all
the
way
through
it
was
a
grand
beer
that
i
should
make
more
notes
about
as
i
will
be
looking
for
more
overall
a
very
good
if
slightly
outside
of
the
box
apa
peeper
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
layers
of
complexities
into
a
seemingly
straightforward
package
well
done
peeper
ale
has
a
striking
amount
of
head
and
lace
and
has
a
summerworthy
drinkability
overall
its
enjoyable
but
feels
more
pils
than
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
great
lightly
medium
with
not
much
of
a
carbonated
feel
smooth
and
crisp
overall
peeper
ale
is
a
solid
beer
but
is
just
missing
a
lot
in
where
it
matters
the
taste
everything
is
basically
amazing
except
for
this
one
crucial
aspect
im
sure
its
just
an
anomaly
im
actually
gratified
to
even
find
this
beer
here
in
ny
hopefully
bottles
of
lunch
and
zoe
will
also
find
their
way
here
nice
light
and
crisp
feel
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
my
favorite
pale
ale
glad
to
see
it
locally
on
tap
definite
summer
dryness
o
overall
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
isnt
too
crazy
on
flavor
a
nice
example
of
the
style
o
this
beer
was
a
wonderful
try
at
the
style
while
almost
there
it
did
have
a
little
bit
of
flaw
that
seemed
to
come
out
in
the
front
abv
is
right
in
line
with
others
of
this
nature
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
pints
of
but
this
one
was
one
and
while
i
enjoyed
it
would
not
go
for
another
just
a
few
tweeks
for
me
and
i
would
love
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
eight
finest
tasting
pales
i
have
tried
it
is
a
cleanly
flavored
and
astoundingly
easy
drinking
treat
o
a
great
beer
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
not
overly
assertive
from
the
hops
and
the
lack
of
a
caramel
malt
base
made
this
a
truly
unique
apa
pours
a
dull
hazy
straw
color
with
a
bright
white
morang
like
head
its
visual
appeal
is
the
weakest
facet
lots
of
nice
hops
in
the
nose
leafy
and
grassy
very
nice
not
as
much
hop
flavor
but
its
apparent
with
a
fine
grain
finish
clean
and
crisp
without
a
noticeable
malt
presence
the
hop
profile
of
this
pale
ale
is
a
lot
stronger
than
most
of
your
run
of
the
mill
maine
micro
ipas
great
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
bodied
dry
finish
easy
drinkin
good
quality
stuff
o
this
is
not
a
straight
up
pale
ale
but
it
is
a
quality
product
and
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
dipas
with
a
strong
grapefruit
presence
than
this
is
definitely
a
pale
ale
for
you
been
hearing
some
good
things
about
this
brew
hope
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
orange
zest
light
pine
mild
caramel
and
a
splash
of
honey
the
taste
follows
this
same
formula
along
with
some
nice
honeydew
and
cantaloupe
bits
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
apa
definitely
living
up
to
all
of
the
good
words
get
some
yet
another
fine
effort
from
the
talented
folks
at
the
maine
beer
co
o
this
one
doesnt
distribute
in
my
area
so
i
do
see
myself
drinking
this
anytime
soon
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
watery
for
my
liking
but
everything
else
is
well
done
i
might
pick
this
up
if
i
saw
it
but
i
would
like
to
try
other
maine
beer
co
beers
first
quite
tasty
ale
more
lemony
hops
some
peppery
spice
quite
dry
in
the
mouth
bright
and
flavorful
highly
enjoyable
and
well
worth
seeking
out
a
very
pleasant
suprise
from
a
brewery
i
did
not
know
much
about
i
want
to
learn
more
and
drink
more
of
their
brews
o
a
great
apa
though
slightly
held
back
by
its
mouthfeel
overall
very
enjoyable
and
packed
with
flavor
considering
pale
ales
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
i
tried
to
judge
it
for
what
it
is
but
obviously
personal
tastes
are
subjective
peeper
ale
hits
a
lot
of
great
qualities
most
other
apas
fail
to
but
still
comes
up
short
in
some
areas
wow
way
to
go
maine
id
drink
this
all
the
time
o
this
is
the
perfect
sessionable
5
5
beer
that
would
go
with
pretty
much
any
meal
event
location
occasion
session
etc
one
of
the
more
smooth
and
drinkable
examples
ive
come
across
thanks
again
michael
for
passing
this
gem
along
to
me
update
after
buying
a
case
of
the
october
2011
batch
i
am
blown
away
by
this
beer
possibly
the
best
pale
ale
on
the
market
right
now
it
blew
away
victory
headwaters
which
i
always
thought
of
as
a
very
good
beer
i
have
to
do
a
large
blind
pale
ale
tasting
one
of
these
days
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
i
gave
the
2nd
half
of
this
beer
to
my
wife
she
didnt
care
for
it
either
o
k
im
at
a
loss
here
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
hop
forward
beer
and
the
body
of
a
lager
im
going
to
take
a
wild
guess
and
say
its
one
of
those
imperial
pilseners
wrong
its
a
maine
beer
company
peeper
ale
apa
o
overall
for
a
american
pale
ale
this
one
is
up
there
great
feel
and
is
light
and
crisp
has
some
destinctive
hop
notes
that
are
well
blended
with
a
decent
malt
backing
a
very
creative
take
on
a
pale
ale
that
should
be
tried
light
bodied
and
quaffable
a
very
nice
and
hoppy
pale
ale
pours
a
dark
hazy
amber
color
with
34
in
finely
carbonated
light
tan
head
and
excellent
retention
of
strong
lacing
aroma
is
citrusy
hoppylemons
sweet
berry
like
some
hops
with
a
hint
of
grass
and
spices
taste
is
dry
lemony
grassy
lightly
hoppy
very
refreshing
o
a
really
nice
simple
pale
ale
really
enjoy
the
grassiness
of
the
hops
there
is
no
biting
bitterness
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace

on
the

pours
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
small
head
lots
of
lacing
great
hoppy
citrus
aroma
with
tropical
fruit
notes
taste
is
bready
and
slightly
citrusy
with
a
bitter
finish
lemon
and
orange
peel
flavors
a
bit
floral
highly
drinkable
pretty
crisp
but
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bite
to
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
and
worth
grabbing
again
for
sure
peeper
works
really
well
an
is
it
an
apa
or
an
ipa
type
of
critter
walking
that
fine
line
alongside
alpha
king
and
arnold
although
zoe
seems
to
get
the
most
attention
im
not
sure
but
what
this
isnt
more
deserving
highly
recommended
o
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
but
work
well
with
the
lighter
body
i
could
see
putting
a
few
back
on
a
nice
summer
day
and
not
get
tired
of
it
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
give
this
a
try
o
i
like
this
beer
has
good
character
overall
im
leaning
towards
calling
this
a
cold
weather
apa
seems
a
bit
heavy
and
lacking
a
certain
something
a
livelinesss
crispness
not
sure
exactly
what
it
is
but
it
is
lacking
something
for
me
still
a
very
solid
pale
ale
and
worthy
of
seeking
out
i
will
easily
have
this
again
i
just
dont
see
myself
making
a
special
trip
or
buying
a
case
of
this
not
an
every
day
sorta
beer
for
me
thats
all
500ml
bottle
manufactured
on

in

and
a
kiss
of
citric

closer
to
light
with
a
lively

the
citrus
nicely
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
along
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
before
culminating
in
a
pleasant
crisp
finish
what
can
i
say
this
is
just
an
all
around
solid
apa
with
lots
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
is
just
what
i
remember
it
being
a
flavorful
hopforward
apa
with
just
the
right
balance
of
bitterness
and
maltiness
for
my
liking
do
soooo
drinkable
a
great
springsummer
pale
ale
that
hits
the
spot
perfectly
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
expected
more
hop
flavor
given
the
aromas
but
came
out
quite
light
decent
effort
thought
it
was
a
bit
older
but
bottled
a
month
ago
might
be
tj
handling
will
try
again
overall
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
breezy
summer
day
i
will
have
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
d
what
a
homerun
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
so
satisfying
so
smooth
so
drinkable
so
tasty
and
above
all
refreshing
its
like
a
gulp
of
water
after
a
pickup
game
o
a
very
solid
hoppy
apa
while
not
in
the
class
of
daisy
cutter
it
is
enjoyably
drinkable
and
worth
trying
overall
great
apa
which
is
something
i
seldom
say
i
can
see
myself
drinking
one
of
these
every
day
during
the
sweltering
summer
months
all
8
of
them
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
i
oculd
easily
drink
all
day
and
not
get
bored
wont
wow
you
and
its
not
over
the
top
but
is
an
appropriate
apa
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
i
will
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
in
ct
d
this
is
a
good
session
ale
goes
down
clean
crisp
and
pretty
smooth
but
the
bitters
are
immediately
overshadowed
by
the
malty
backbone
of
this
beer
wouldve
liked
to
have
the
bitter
stick
around
a
little
longer
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
has
a
nice
feel
on
the
palate
moderate
to
low
carbonation
on
the
palate
just
enough
to
brighten
the
beer
great
hop
flavor
in
the
midpalate
with
some
moderate
bitterness
at
the
back
the
finish
is
clean
and
not
dry
wet
finish
with
no
aftertaste
easy
drinking
obtainable
flavorful
hoppy
beer
great
fruitiness
in
the
midpalate
every
thing
is
appropriately
leveled
and
balanced
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
drinkability
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
but
i
do
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
an
apa
with
a
light
body
with
a
hop
profile
that
comes
and
goes
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
solid
beer
really
nice
citrus
hoppiness
and
very
refreshing
on
the
palate
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
love
the
juicy
citrus
hop
character
good
stuff
o
this
is
surprisingly
balanced
given
the
aggresive
hop
profile
but
overall
this
is
one
fine
brew
and
one
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
would
definately
have
again
skal
pours
a
very
cloudyhazy
yellowbronze
thick
offwhite
bubbly
head
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
slight
citrus
and
some
caramelsweet
malts
flavor
is
of
faint
toffeecaramel
malts
and
some
earthypiney
hops
bigger
hop
profile
than
i
expected
for
being
an
apa
very
well
carbonated
with
a
prickly
mouth
feel
rather
dry
with
a
grassyherbal
finish
overall
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
until
i
pass
out
because
this
movie
really
sucks
o
pretty
decent
for
a
spring
seasonal
beer
certainly
appreciable
for
a
beer
at
5
5
o
a
very
nice
pleasant
beer
nothing
too
offensive
about
it
and
the
hop
profile
was
great
definitely
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
hopforward
pales
ive
had
in
a
while
fantastic
to
drink
on
a
hot
afternoon
like
this
one
pours
a
nice
peach
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
the
nose
brings
slight
tropical
hop
notes
plus
a
bit
of
light
citrus
characteristics
there
is
a
touch
of
malt
lingering
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
along
with
same
lines
as
the
nose
but
with
a
nice
bitterness
coming
through
good
amount
of
tropical
notes
as
well
some
light
mango
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
really
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
packing
in
a
bunch
of
flavor
im
guessing
maine
again
based
on
the
bottle
shape
it
goes
down
easy
probably
about
5
abv
and
gets
better
with
every
sip
drinkability
is
solid
this
is
a
mild
brew
in
flavor
and
abv
but
has
a
potent
aroma
which
is
really
interesting
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
big
ipas
im
accustomed
to
although
this
one
could
potentially
be
a
phenomenal
big
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
of
moderate
i
was
kind
of
bored
by
this
one
i
see
this
beer
priced
67
definitely
not
worth
the
money
especially
just
for
a
500ml
bottle
overall
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
tiny
little
brewery
from
maine
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
beer
still
surprised
me
it
is
hoppy
and
has
a
big
bite
but
at
the
same
time
it
feels
very
light
at
5
5
this
would
not
be
a
bad
session
beer
for
a
guy
whos
used
to
69
very
good
beer
drink
it
with
dinner
sort
of
wish
i
had
a
growler
of
this
though
perhaps
the
bottleconditioning
is
contributing
to
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
ale
very
well
executed
example
of
the
style
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
them
the
cpj
d
this
is
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
i
give
two
schlitz
for
peeper
ale
well
balanced
delicious
and
easy
drinking
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
will
definitely
be
trying
more
from
these
brothers
bottle
appearance
smell
taste
all
seemed
well
thought
out
an
all
around
pleasant
package
and
an
easy
recommendation
ill
be
picking
up
another
next
time
i
run
out
and
make
sure
to
have
a
backup
in
my
fridge
for
the
upcoming
springsummer
months
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
well
crafted
and
well
balanced
this
is
well
worth
enjoying
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
for
a
hop
head
accustomed
to
normally
drinking
bigger
stuff
just
got
my
second
one
of
these
in
the
story
bif
for
best
story
great
bif
and
once
again
great
beer
id
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
tastes
great
and
reminds
me
of
what
i
like
about
the
apa
style
its
a
sure
sign
of
quality
beer
when
you
taste
something
as
good
as
this
one
excellent
great
job
highly
drinkable
session
worthy
only
5
5
percent
abv
drinkability
is
great
easy
drinking
very
enjoyable
you
think
perhaps
a
fizzy
beer
is
coming
but
it
isnt
good
stuff
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
little
apa
here
and
while
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
little
more
malt
activity
in
the
taste
that
crisp
yet
smooth
body
really
delivers
here
this
was
my
first
experience
with
this
new
small
batch
brewery
and
im
anxious
to
try
out
more
from
them
the
pour
makes
a
hefty
one
inch
head
to
top
off
the
slightly
hazy
light
orange
color
citrus
hoppy
notes
but
yet
some
sweetness
in
the
aroma
taste
is
an
enjoyable
not
too
bitey
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
id
like
a
bit
more
bulk
very
drinkable
however
the
price
pushes
me
to
something
else
if
im
having
more
than
one
drinkability
is
out
of
this
world
there
is
nothing
better
then
finding
a
low
abv
full
flavored
beer
that
you
could
drink
all
day
and
every
day
this
is
one
of
those
beers
for
me
no
its
not
a
super
complex
barrel
aged
brew
but
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
i
can
taste
that
in
every
sip
i
take
all
in
all
bravo
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
if
you
like
awesome
session
brews
then
this
will
be
right
up
your
alley
even
if
you
enjoy
big
beers
you
may
enjoy
the
refreshing
nature
of
this
brew
definitely
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
good
work
guys
d
great
drinker
in
the
manner
of
pliny
the
elder
but
with
less
alchohol
content
i
call
this
a
very
friedly
ale
that
makes
you
want
more
than
one
solid
pale
ale
more
rustic
in
flavor
than
the
nose
suggests
biscuit
and
cereal
malts
with
piney
herbal
hops
nice
bitterness
through
the
middle
and
finish
some
stone
fruit
on
the
far
finish
with
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
as
well
bitterness
finish
is
long
nice
pale
heard
great
things
about
this
company
exceeded
expectations
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
i
have
had
i
look
forward
to
more
offerings
from
mbc
nicely
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
not
quite
exciting
but
a
solid
effort
none
the
less
most
definitely
worth
buying
i
was
actually
quite
impressed
with
this
and
overall
it
makes
me
lament
the
lack
of
session
beers
in
the
northwest
this
is
an
excellent
find
spicy
pungent
but
roundcornered
aroma
with
a
touch
of
oranges
and
honeysuckle
a
spicy
edgy
notoverly
hopped
taste
of
citrus
and
dull
pine
with
a
razorsharp
body
that
will
cut
right
through
everything
from
burger
grease
to
curry
with
its
modest
abv
this
will
be
a
great
addition
to
a
summer
afternoon
nice
job
what
a
winner
here
tiny
brewery
with
a
fantastic
product
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
try
this
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
good
american
pale
ale
nothing
special
drinks
amazing
i
used
the
word
delicate
a
few
times
to
describe
this
beer
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
it
must
have
taken
a
delicate
touch
to
brew
a
beer
this
balanced
and
tasty
exceptional
drinkability
22oz
were
gone
before
i
knew
it
and
i
wanted
more
of
it
light
enough
to
have
multiple
pints
and
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
an
interesting
beer
very
homebrew
like
in
its
rustic
like
qualities
mostly
grassy
very
little
citrus
the
taste
is
a
bit
tilted
towards
the
bittering
hop
although
the
malts
are
thick
enough
and
full
bodied
enough
to
keep
things
in
check
the
piney
hop
gives
way
a
bit
to
additional
coloration
in
the
orange
blossom
family
i
appreciate
the
low
abv
of
this
beer
its
a
medium
bodied
affair
bottle
conditioned
carbonated
enough
and
quite
good
the
bittering
lingers
just
a
bit
into
the
aftertaste
but
doesnt
hang
on
interminably
either
this
nano
brewery
is
a
pleasant
surprise
ill
come
back
for
more
means
of
extras
as
much
as
possible
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
fluffy
white
head
that
takes
its
time
receding
smells
of
citrus
lemons
and
tart
orange
abound
with
hints
of
bread
and
mineral
water
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
pine
and
citrus
mixed
with
a
bready
lightly
caramel
malt
base
finish
is
quite
dry
with
a
lingering
citrusy
hop
bite
medium
level
of
carbonation
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
resinous
mouthfeel
wow
i
am
rather
impressed
with
this
beer
i
find
it
a
tad
thin
but
otherwise
this
is
a
fantastic
flavorful
easy
drinker
this
one
does
straddle
the
line
between
apa
and
ipa
if
i
didnt
have
to
travel
to
another
state
to
get
this
i
might
drink
this
a
lot
more
often
by
my
estimation
a
little
more
ipa
than
pale
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
more
as
i
drank
it
if
someone
offered
me
a
bottle
id
have
it
again
but
id
not
search
it
out
as
im
not
a
huge
apa
fan
a
really
good
pale
ale
with
a
unique
flavor
fresh
and
clean
and
environmentally
friendly
too
big
thumbs
up
to
whoever
makes
and
runs
this
brewing
company
goes
down
a
little
too
easily
new
england
is
really
putting
out
some
excellent
hoppy
beers
as
of
late
price
is
a
bummer
500ml
is
a
great
serving
size
for
this
beer
but
id
much
rather
see
this
in
a
6pack
d
wow
just
wow
a
definate
session
beer
here
as
this
goes
down
incredibly
easy
could
gulp
this
stuff
back
in
one
fell
swoop
need
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
d
moderately
high
a
bit
pricey
but
one
ill
def
be
buying
more
of
scarily
drinkable

great

almost

this
maker
has
an
incredible
environmental
and
social
conscience
using
sustainable
energy
local
farm
products
and
giving
a

of
profits
to

causes
you
can
feel
good
about
drinking
this
beer
taste
starts
with
pale
malts
goes
moderately
citrus
in
the
middle
then
comes
on
with
some
bitterness
that
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
nice
brew
d
very
good
drinkability
this
might
be
the
quintessential
pale
ale
the
initial
sip
has
a
solid
pale
malt
base
it
has
a
good
body
without
being
too
rich
the
carbonation
is
fine
almost
prickly
the
swallow
is
bitter
but
not
unbalanced
lots
of
pepper
to
the
finish
the
aftertaste
lasts
a
long
time
this
tasting
reminds
me
of
the
first
time
i
tried
a
sierra

peeper
ale
pours
out
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
big
rocky
head
pouring
out
the
contents
at
the
bottom
of

gives
the
beer
a
slightly
more
hazed
color
than
before
grass
and
lemon
come
through
immediately
in
the
nose
along
with
a
bit
of
chamomile

extremely
interesting

yeast
sourdough
bread
grass
pepper
and
lemon
rind
all
come
to
mind
all
of
these
are
in
the
background
almost
ghostly
tasting
if
that
makes
any
sense
mouthfeel
is
stellar
coming
off
light
yet
full
of
complexities
drinkability
is
great
though
i
recommend
taking
your
time
with
this
one
to
see
how
it
changes
as
it
warms
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
interesting
brews
to
hit
shelves
here
in
a
long
time
for
fans
of
straight
up
apa
this
should
be
sought
out
a
great
representation
of
an
apa
pronounced
citrus
hop
character
but
balanced
with
a
clean
malt
presence
pours
and
retains
a
frothy
white
head
finishes
with
pleasant
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
if
you
can
find
it
its
definitely
worth
a
try

a

with
a
heavy
dose
of
citrus

balanced
with
some
lighter
malts
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
impressive
smallbatch
ale
to
be
had
by

one
of
the
most
interesting
pale
ales
out
there
different
in
that
the
complexities
ask
the
taste
buds
to
work
hard
but
the
beer
manages
to
stay
quaffable
at
the
same
time
drinkability
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
disappearing
quickly
from
my
glass
a
nice
flavorful
though
albeit
mellow
beer
that
is
damn
good
supremely
drinkable
great
beer

the

drinkability

it
was
a
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
definitely
a
very
nice
apa
overall
but
leaning
towards
the
ipa
side
of
the
style
the
hoppiness
was
nicely
done
as
well
thank
you
dan
and
thank
you
guys
at
maine
beer
for
keeping
it
real
and
honest
your
worldview
mirrors
my
own
and
for
that
i
truly
respect
you
d
polished
the
bottle
off
easily
good
drinker
d
it
needs
some
more
malt
backbone
perhaps
a
bit
of
pils
for
balancing
sweetness
good
hop
level
for
a
nicely
drinkable
pale
ale
my
question
is
with
how
much
sediment
is
in
this
how
can
they
even
say
pouring
completely
would
be
ok
sure
its
good
for
you
but
its
pure
yeast
taste
and
cloudier
than
the
darkest
gray
sky
it
takes
away
from
the
beer
in
my
opinion
please
note
this
i
just
want
to
mention
first
that
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
it
mentions
that
this
is
bottle
conditioned
with
live
yeast
it
says
serve
in
a
glass
with
or
without
a
complete
pour
i
choose
not
to
do
a
complete
pour
and
i
am
glad
i
choose
that
i
poured
the
sediment
in
a
separate
glass
and
saw
a
muddy
brown
liquid
something
i
would
not
want
to
drink
very
tasty
and
despite
the
overcarbonation
its
still
a
good
drinker
thoroughly
balanced
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
given
its
name
and
its
aromas
this
is
a
fantastic
spring
beer
but
is
equally
enjoyable
on
a
rainy
day
in
fall
except
now
its
raining
fresh
hops
which
is
unfortunately
not
covered
on
my
rental
insurance
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
as
its
alternatively
called
peeper
ale
is
a
nice
spring
apa
while
not
mindblowing
its
simple
clean
and
has
some
character
just
as
maine

seems
to
the

the
best
one
i
have
ever
had
look

taste
were

solid
feel
was
as
many
have
described
somewhat
light
the
finish
was
interesting
dry
with
an
almost
peppery
aftertaste
overall
i
thought
it
was
just
okay
poured
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
disapated
fairly
quickly
i
was
pleased
with
the
decent
lacing
unfortunately
though
i
was
disappointed
with
the
smell
i
couldnt
grasp
what
it
was
exactly
but
was
unpleasing
to
me
fourtunetly
that
smell
did
not
carry
over
to
the
taste
which
i
found
quite
pleasing
with
sweet
citrus
flavors
that
finished
with
sutle
hints
of
pine
slightly
dry
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
the
flavor
was
spot
on
this
beer
is
really
really
good
the
bouquet
is
plentiful
taste
has
a
great
start
and
better
finish
my
first
from
this
brewery
wont
be
my
last
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
i
will
probably
never
buy
it
again
due
to
the
price
i
feel
like
i
should
try
everything
from
maine
beer
company
once
but
unless
it
becomes
more
affordable
i
likely
wont
buy
it
again
which
is
a
shame
because
they
make
excellent
product
its
deep
its
rich
its
complex
but
it
has
the
lighter
body
and
bite
of
a
pale
ale
compared
to
an
ipa
it
holds
a
great
mix
of
hop
notes
with
spicy
and
biting
dry
bitterness
topped
with
floral
and
tropical
fruit
juice
plus
a
citrus
punch
its
just
impressive
how
much
variety
of
hop
flavors
this
beer
covers
go
enjoy
a
bottle
even
for
a
pale
ale
its
a
sipper
big
head
somewhat
hoppy
and
lightbodied
for
the
style
which
is
to
my
liking
the
hop
flavors
are
complex
and
forward
without
being
too
bitter
finishes
dry
lightbodied
with
a
perfect
pale
ale
punch
but
remember
its
only
play
fighting
here
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
because
nobody
likes
being
knocked
out
all
the
time
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
very
drinkable
clean
and
crisp
it
lives
up
to
its
wine
like
bottling
and
packaging
the
color
is
almost
champagne
like
and
i
think
it
would
pair
with
many
foods
my
only
hesitation
about
this
beer
is
that
in
it
might
not
have
a
strong
enough
taste
for
a
beer
drinkers
on
this
forum
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
this
is
a
better
version
of
sn
pale
ale
its
also
more
expensive
i
have
not
had
any
of
the
bigger
more
popular
maine
ales
but
if
this
is
any
indication
its
a
solid
brewery
and
one
i
would
like
to
try
more
offerings
from
overall
very
impressive
pale
ale
has
many
shared
characteristics
to
beers
like
the
chainbreaker
but
arguably
better
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
tassstyyyyyeeehh
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
herbal
grassy
piney
and
a
bit
dank
the
taste
is
earthy
dirty
hoppy
and
pretty
delicious
a
nice
slightly
toasty
malt
character
adds
a
nice
depth
of
vague
sweetness
dusty
yeast
and
dry
and
smooth
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
chewy
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
5
month
old
bottle
still
solid
probably
better
fresh
mouthfeel
perfectly
on
point
carbonation
medium
and
a
solid
medium
body
that
is
a
little
thicker
than
youd
expect
from
a
pale
ale
albeit
one
higher
in
abv
than
apa
normally
weighs
in
at
the
dryness
in
the
finish
is
exquisite
perfect
balance
love
the
grapfruite
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
damn
drank
a
pint
on
tap
at
moxy
in
portsmouth
nh
well
balanced
flavor
and
great
finish
i
cant
think
of
a
more
appealing
pale
ale
than
this
one
beautiful
translucent
orange
color
lovely
citrus
nose
crisp
and
very
pleasantly
drying
on
the
tongue
malts
are
very
subdued
both
in
flavor
and
aroma
but
in
a
good
way
maine
brewing
really
knows
what
theyre
doing
and
i
applaud
their
restraint
as
far
as
not
trying
to
make
every
imaginable
style
of
beer
drink
this
pale
ale
fresh
overall
i
just
cant
stop
drinking
this
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
regularly
picked
up
two
single
bottles
dated
1028
have
had
this
beer
several
times
but
just
now
appreciating
how
damn
good
it
is
when
super
fresh
subtle
delicate
nuanced
and
many
other
adjectives
that
escape
my
buzzed
brain
at
the
moment
just
killed
the
second
one
still
dont
love
their
prices
but
this
is
super
high
end
apa
o
about
near
as
perfect
so
you
get
for
a
lower
abv
pale
ale
very
clean
dry
orange
on
the
tongue
and
very
light
in
the
mouth
it
looks
great
it
smells
great
it
tastes
great
find
if
drink
it
beware
of
bottle
dates
at
two
months
this
beer
is
shockingly
bland
on
citrus
falls
off
quick
under
a
month
you
will
just
sit
there
dumbfounded
o
the
astringency
of
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
but
thats
my
only
complaint
its
refreshing
has
a
solid
body
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
kudos
mbc
o
definitely
quite
good
but
i
feel
like
its
not
as
good
as
the
price
should
reflect
my
favorite
pale
ale
by
far
these
guys
certainly
know
how
to
brew
northern
new
england
is
really
experiencing
a
brewing
renaissance
after
decades
of
buttery
ringwood
sameness
two
thumbs
up
i
think
this
is
excellent
and
is
underrated
great
new
england
apa
unfiltered
deliciousness
this
might
be
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
great
beer
i
love
having
this
beer
on
tap
and
bottle
is
great
as
well
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
nice
and
smooth
the
percentage
of
alcohol
at
6
is
perfect
if
u
havent
had
this
beer
try
to
get
a
hold
of
it
probably
the
best
apa
in
new
england
or
ever
really
i
know
something
that
is
6
abv
isnt
an
ideal
session
beer
but
damn
me
if
i
dont
want
to
try
if
i
were
to
encounter
this
ontap
at
one
of
my
locals
id
probably
stick
with
it
all
night
which
is
sad
because
this
is
an
every
day
pale
ale
this
is
a
vision
of
what
day
to
day
fresh
beer
can
be
delicate
flavors
masterfully
put
together
a
pleasure
to
drink
provided
its
fresh
and
plentiful
im
not
chasing
the
delivery
truck
around
to
get
a
chance
to
taste
this
but
im
loving
the
hell
out
of
the
fresh
bottle
i
lucked
into
why
not
just
sell
every
drop
of
this
fast
fresh
local
a
great
pale
ale
with
understated
malts
and
an
assertive
hoppiness
this
is
really
well
made
and
definitely
tasty
but
as
with
other
maine
beers
i
feel
like
it
could
be
a
bit
bolder
i
know
im
quibbling
it
is
great
best
pale
ive
had
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
it
knocked
my
socks
off
incredibly
crisp
refreshing
hoppy
and
super
drinkable
final
score
3

o
amazing
apa
from
mbc
while
peeper
is
a
great
beer
this
one
is
just
so
much
better
in
my
opinion
i
wish
i
could
get
these
beers
in
tn
overall
this
beer
is
a
flagship
pale
ale
nothing
too
aggressive
in
the
way
of
hops
but
good
balance
flavor
overall
bought
at
beverage
baron
in
barre
vt
dated
726
hazy
orange
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
any
decent
ipa
it
has
a
huge
citrusy
smell
that
hit
me
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
the
taste
followed
albiet
a
hair
more
bitter
then
i
was
expecting
if
it
was
just
a
bit
more
balanced
less
bitter
it
could
be
as
good
as
lawsons
sip
of
sunshine
it
was
bright
sunny
citrusy
with
a
dry
finish
that
wants
to
be
followed
with
more
it
says
6
but
it
packed
a
pretty
good
punch
too
perhaps
because
it
goes
down
so
easily
cheers
damn
ok
so
this
is
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
maine
brewing
always
kills
it
but
this
time
its
ridiculous
this
is
on
par
if
not
better
than
three
floyds
zombie
dust
actually
screw
it
this
is
better
great
hoppy
taste
with
an
awesome
citrus
afternote
grapefruit
or
tangerine
cant
really
tell
95
is
good
but
sorely
underrated
for
this
beer
just
go
get
it
and
youll
agree
with
me
again
damn
overall
better
than
the
other
pale
ales
i
have
had
from
maine
beer
but
still
fair
from
my
list
of
top
pale
ales
the
taste
come
off
with
too
much
earthiness
along
with
a
hop
profile
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
that
said
it
is
refreshing
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
maine
beer
company
again
with
some
of
the
best
hoppy
beers
around
big
bright
orange
hue
big
white
head
and
huge
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
big
citrus
nose
orange
dominated
slightly
tropical
taste
starts
off
with
some
biscuit
notes
grapefruit
and
orange
through
mid
palate
and
finishes
bitter
and
piney
big
bright
explosion
of
carbonation
medium
body
and
slightly
dry
finish
classic
american
pale
ale
and
one
of
the
best
overall
mo
is
a
beer
to
seek
out
savor
and
enjoy
a
perfectly
executed
complex
flavorful
ale
with
moderate
alcohol
the
real
deal
o
crazy
good
pale
ale
and
easily
eclipses
my
favorite
from
founders
great
example
of
the
style
o
really
solid
beer
probably
my
favorite
from
maine
beer
overall
a
good
brew
but
i
will
not
be
purchasing
more
maine
beer
company
beers
unless
the
prices
in
my
area
come
down
7
99
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
is
highway
robbery
i
can
get
a
sixer
of
sierra
nevada
for
the
same
price
and
this
really
doesnt
taste
any
better
o
this
was
an
excellent
apa
that
was
a
bit
pine
heavy
in
the
profile
but
so
well
balanced
it
is
mostly
golden
in
color
and
pours
with
a
thin
lacey
head
with
a
mild
dank
hoppy
flavor
as
with
most
maine
beer
co
beers
the
fresher
the
better
so
be
mindful
of
the
stampedon
production
date
after
90
days
the
quality
does
suffer
and
that
would
certainly
be
a
waste
of
an
extremely
well
crafted
ale
cheers
o
i
look
at
a
lot
of
these
reviews
and
the
one
thing
i
can
say
is
complaining
about
the
price
is
such
a
cop
out
for
giving
a
beer
this
good
a
low
grade
this
beer
is
not
meant
to
be
bought
by
the
dozen
and
sessioned
all
night
long
its
7
a
bottle
thats
the
equivalent
of
some
cheep
wine
buy
the
beer
and
enjoy
it
o
another
well
made
brew
from
maine
beer
company
barely
a
false
note
with
this
one
overall
this
is
a
solid
impression
of
the
style
but
not
one
i
would
actively
seek
m
this
beers
weakness
as
its
very
carbonated
overall
mbc
does
it
again
this
is
damn
near
a
perfect
pale
ale
so
goodand
this
bottle
was
38
days
old
i
can
only
imagine
how
glorious
it
would
be
ultrafresh
combines
a
very
fragrant
hop
aroma
with
a
complex
flavour
and
a
highly
sessionable
profile
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
no
complaints
taste
has
lots
of
complexies
smooth
green
fruits
citrus
and
florals
with
pine
and
earthy
undertones
carbonation
felt
on
the
low
side
but
it
really
helped
the
hops
come
through
comes
highly
recommended
delightful
beer
and
shows
excellent
character
as
it
warms

thanks
to
my
bro
john
for
sharing
the
spoils
of
his
travels
highly
reccomend
super
drinkable
and
a
great
clean
mouth
feel
not
overly
hoppy
and
not
the
typical
tropical
fruit
bomb
every
other
brewery
is
pushing
out
these
days
at
around
6
abv
you
can
have
a
few
and
not
be
disturbing
the
neighbors
enjoyed
this
one
sitting
by
the
campfire
on
a
cool
night
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
overall
another
fantastic
offering
from
mbc
would
never
hesitate
to
try
an
offering
from
these
guys
seek
it
out
d
highly
drinkable
though
i
was
disappointed
that
the
sweeter
fruit
notes
did
not
translate
through
to
the
taste
its
extremely
fresh
crisp
which
seems
to
be
the
trend
with
mbc
beers
cheers
maine
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
i
cant
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
try
any
of
their
beers
this
one
lives
up
to
the
small
amount
of
hype
built
around
it
cant
wait
to
have
lunch
one
day
poured
a
cloudy
gold
body
maybe
orange
with
slow
dying
one
finger
head
and
lace
all
down
glass
a
wonderfully
wet
citric
hop
aroma
with
touches
of
sweetness
smooth
slightly
grainy
with
something
akin
to
crackers
for
a
dryness
that
passes
the
tongue
on
each
sip
flavors
are
bitter
yet
juicy
hops
and
there
are
some
tropical
fruits
and
a
touch
of
sugary
sweetness
but
for
most
part
this
is
a
hoppy
dry
beer
overall
an
awesome
apa
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
very
westcoast
even
more
so
than
a
lot
of
westcoast
beers
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
hophead
looking
for
a
fix
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
overall
a
tasty
american
pale
ale
that
delivers
on
quality
flavour
i
can
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summers
day
very
flavorful
very
hoppy
in
a
pine
and
grapefruit
way
nice
mellow
brew
very
nice
a
little
bit
of
the
simcoecat
pee
in
the
smell
but
its
not
bad
the
flavor
imparts
the
same
but
its
not
bad
not
getting
the
sweet
aroma
i
first
had
in
the
taste
and
that
aroma
has
long
since
subsided
lemon
bottled
31114
although
the
packaging
might
not
be
the
most
eyecatching
or
engaging
but
within
is
a
great
beer
a
light
gold
color
with
a
thin
head
yet
the
smell
was
fantastic
with
hop
and
citrus
notes
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
even
better
with
well
defined
notes
of
hop
through
out
with
great
flavors
of
lemon
peel
banana
and
i
tasted
notes
of
elderberry
although
those
i
was
with
said
they
didnt
agree
one
of
my
favorite
kinds
of
beer
simple
yet
excellently
crafted
it
was
a
little
thin
for
me
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
and
would
definitely
recommend
a
very
recent
arrival
to
mercurial
calgary
in
april
four
beers
from
this
maine
brewery
have
appeared
in
my
fridge
thanks
to
a
headsup
from
my
favorite
neighborhood
beer
dealer
wordemupg
cheers
brother
this
is
only
round
one
and
frankly
things
might
have
already
plateaued
based
on
how
fing
tasty
this
pale
ale
is
a
somewhat
cloudy
yellow
with
orange
and
red
tints
featuring
a
lively
pour
with
a
soapy
white
head
managing
to
fill
much
of
my
shaker
pint
glass
phenomenal
head
retention
stuff
sits
there
like
a
milkshake
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
and
redolent
with
a
hoppy
spice
i
get
lychee
and
white
grape
mango
orange
faint
pineapple
kind
of
a
gummy
worms
effect
presumably
from
the
crystal
malts
an
absolutely
masterpiece
on
the
palate
with
uberclean
yeast
pine
grapefruit
rind
peaches
and
some
weedy
and
catty
notes
all
in
a
wellintegrated
interplay
bitter
but
very
clean
faint
onion
and
pepper
apparent
from
the
ipalevel
hopping
regime
but
with
nothing
sticking
out
in
an
unpleasant
fashion
toasty
caramel
malts
provide
the
backbone
and
the
finish
is
leafy
and
a
tad
woody
with
more
citrus
rind
and
tropical
ghost
notes
lingering
until
the
end
this
could
be
the
best
american
pale
ale
ive
had
to
date
a
hopcentric
brew
but
with
sublime
malt
balance
and
nary
a
flaw
to
be
found
as
far
as
apas
go
this
is
perfect
appearance
is
a
hazy
khaki
orange
smells
amazing
big
time
citrus
orange
peel
and
lemon
in
particular
a
bit
of
pineapple
as
well
taste
is
slightly
hop
forward
and
heavy
on
the
citrus
but
mellow
and
refreshing
enough
to
remind
you
that
this
isnt
an
ipa
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
and
it
isnt
close
as
wonderful
as
maines
lunch
is
i
think
i
like
mo
a
little
bit
better
i
was
pretty
stoked
to
see
this
brewery
in
alberta
and
my
first
experience
was
a
good
one
im
looking
forward
to
the
other
3
i
have
in
my
fridge
serving
type
bottle
nice
gold
body
bit
cloudy
with
awesome
lacing
smell
is
real
nice
grassy
floral
and
hoppy
lush
citrus
fruit
in
the
flavor
really
explodes
in
the
palate
very
creamy
strong
body
nice
balance
of
sweet
fruit
and
citrus
bitterness
a
real
winner
a
very
well
rendered
american
pale
ale
the
hops
definitely
in
charge
but
they
dont
abuse
the
power
theyre
much
more
about
the
flavour
than
any
bitterness
chip
on
their
collective
shoulders
pretty
tasty
other
than
the
highend
single
serving
price
around
here
i
could
see
enjoying
a
number
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
i
know
a
session
with
a
6
abv
brew
blasphemy
very
nice
apa
from
maine
beer
company
great
pale
ale
from
maine
served
on
tap
at
millers
pub
pours
a
orangeish
gold
with
slight
haze
white
head
forms
and
retains
a
collar
some
lacing
present
the
nose
is
heavenly
loads
of
tropical
notes
mango
flesh
peach
and
pineapple
this
is
backed
by
some
pine
and
resin
as
well
as
mild
malty
notes
the
taste
is
hop
forward
with
moderate
bitterness
and
an
emphasis
on
tropical
fruits
there
is
not
much
body
or
malt
backbone
which
works
to
make
this
brew
light
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
high
carbonation
overall
a
very
well
crafted
pale
with
an
excellent
hop
profile
check
it
out
o
a
fantastic
ipa
balanced
complex
and
simply
delicious
overall
another
great
beer
from
a
fantastic
brewery
o
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
from
a
great
brewer
no
match
for
some
of
their
other
brews
but
i
would
offer
this
as
a
decent
entry
apa
to
a
new
craft
drinker
to
see
if
they
appreciate
the
smell
and
fruityfloral
tastes
that
are
present
in
many
ipas
that
pack
a
more
bitter
punch
if
i
felt
they
were
worth
the
cost
bought
most
of
the
beers
that
maine
beer
co
was
offering
this
past
fall
with
plans
to
do
a
tasting
with
six
of
my
ba
buddies
but
i
wound
up
drinking
them
all
with
a
couple
of
my
beer
buddies
who
attended
my
annual
new
years
party
tasted
peeper
ale
another
one
zoe
mean
ole
tom
king
titus
lil
one
lunch
and
mo
lunch
and
mo
were
two
of
the
eight
maine
beer
co
beers
that
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
tasting
mo
did
not
disappoint
me
in
any
way
outstanding
is
where
i
rated
it
and
it
was
all
of
that
pours
a
slightly
hazey
golden
color
with
a
couple
fingers
of
thick
sudzy
head
and
leaves
breat
lacing
as
it
falls
mo
has
a
great
hop
blast
of
a
nose
with
lots
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
other
tropical
fruit
pine
resin
and
some
floral
notes
the
taste
follows
suite
and
this
apa
drinks
almost
like
an
ipa
with
big
juicy
fruit
pine
and
spicy
hop
notes
but
with
a
nice
bready
malt
backbone
with
a
clean
dry
finish
the
body
is
full
but
light
on
the
palate
and
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
making
mo
light
and
refreshing
really
well
done
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
with
an
inch
of
white
head
the
head
fades
leaving
behind
tons
of
lacing
reeks
of
citrusy
hops
awesome
crisp
and
refreshing
with
malt
and
hops
in
near
perfect
balance
an
awesome
brew
the
only
problem
with
the
maine
beers
is
that
they
arent
cheap
and
they
run
in
and
out
of
availability
but
thats
what
happens
when
you
make
something
special
in
a
finite
amount
cant
believe
i
never
reviewed
this
beer
until
now
superfresh
bottle
2
weeks
old
damn
nice
balance
is
struck
here
by
maine
the
hops
are
super
fresh
and
fairly
pungent
but
it
all
rounds
out
in
the
end
this
is
what
hoppier
apas
should
be
like
great
hop
flavors
with
balance
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
a
miniipa
in
my
opinion
just
a
great
pale
ale
o
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
wish
i
was
out
at
a
baseball
game
with
a
glass
of
this
in
hand
it
would
make
for
a
perfect
experience
different
kind
of
pale
ale
as
it
behaves
like
spritzy
soda
water
but
with
strong
hoppiness
the
hops
are
light
and
earthy
with
pine
rose
petal
flower
spring
like
airy
tastes
with
an
easy
caramel
malt
sweetness
quenching
and
easy
this
is
different
but
delicious

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
and
following
flavor
the
nose
right
from
the
start
gave
freshness
and
cleanliness
that
is
hard
to
come
by
although
the
taste
rushes
in
rather
abruptly
it
too
gave
a
spice
and
ease
of
sip
that
followed
rather
well
this
is
the
last
of
the
maine
beer
company
heavy
hitters
for
us
to
sample
and
it
was
certainly
no
disappointment
compared
to
lunch
and
zoe
however
we
did
find
this
guy
to
sip
back
a
bit
easier
and
flow
a
touch
lighter
while
this
can
be
attributable
to
stylistic
differences
it
detracts
nothing
from
the
overall
sentiment
of
flavor
and
forward
punch
this
beer
has
to
offer
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
their
best
most
consistently
drinkable
to
date
atmosphere
is
really
nice
great
persistent
head
and
some
very
persistent
lacing
nose
is
hoppy
with
a
slight
balance
of
sweet
resin
hoppy
bitterness
rules
the
day
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
pours
a
large
frothy
head
cresting
around
three
fingers
of
eggshell
white
foam
very
whipped
up
and
airy
lots
of
dimpling
across
the
surface
the
retention
is
soso
the
lacing
is
comprised
of
a
few
razor
thin
but
very
long
streaks
the
liquid
is
a
pleasing
light
orange
with
a
mild
metallic
sheen
quite
clear
and
pretty
slight
yellowing
at
the
rims
plenty
of
fat
bubbles
no
beads
all
randomly
dispersed
the
nose
has
a
certain
purity
to
it
milled
grains
sour
mixed
white
citrus
spoonful
of
honey
pine
cone
not
very
sappy
minimal
herbaceousness
soft
cocoa
maltiness
needs
to
warm
to
really
release
the
peach
yellow
apple
apricot
fruit
scents
fullbodied
in
fact
a
little
too
broad
shouldered
as
it
tends
to
progress
slowly
through
the
palate
here
its
much
more
floral
and
the
white
to
pink
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
a
bigger
overall
element
the
fluffy
carbonation
helps
relieve
some
weight
and
create
lift
and
mouth
perfume
the
sweetness
of
the
apricot
peach
pear
fruit
takes
hold
with
force
some
peppery
notes
but
the
graininess
lost
a
bit
otherwise
does
a
good
job
of
masking
the
total
sweetness
and
making
it
a
blended
experience
versus
bunch
of
soloists
jockeying
for
position
overall
i
could
drink
this
by
the
pint
any
afternoon
doesnt
ever
really
live
up
to
its
own
aroma
but
its
still
excellent
o
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
but
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
better
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
fresher
bottle
date
was
102213
ill
update
my
rating
if
need
be
prost
o
i
like
the
smell
a
lot
and
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
i
like
that
it
is
not
very
bitter
but
the
piney
taste
is
pretty
strong
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
a
flavor
i
would
seek
out
but
it
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
piney
taste
without
the
bitter
which
seems
a
bit
unusual
pours
dark
gold
thick
big
bubbled
white
foam
over
one
inch
high
pine
nose
grassy
too
smooth
mellow
malt
flavor
hop
held
in
check
perfectly
balanced
and
absolutely
delicious
simple
but
great
a
bit
more
grapefruit
citrus
citra
and
this
could
be
even
better
but
wont
complain
got
this
bottle
from
bay
ridge
in
annapolis
well
past
its
prime
most
likely
with
a
7313
born
on
date
drinking
1414
the
maine
beer
stuff
was
this
old
everywhere
i
went
in
md
while
visiting
so
i
figured
i
would
take
a
chance
anyway
pours
a
slightly
hazy
apricot
color
with
a
massive
fluffy
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
zesty
earthy
hops
alongside
some
citrus
and
a
big
sweet
toffeecaramel
malt
bill
just
smelling
this
i
have
to
assume
it
isnt
fresh
enough
to
enjoy
as
intended
so
ill
tick
for
now
and
rerate
another
time
with
a
fresh
one
flavor
begins
with
some
light
grass
a
good
bit
of
lemon
zest
grapefruit
and
ending
with
some
sweet
toffee
even
with
this
age
the
beer
is
light
and
zesty
on
the
palate
i
will
have
to
try
this
fresh
because
it
must
be
glorious
hops
are
a
bit
on
the
stale
side
and
the
malt
bill
is
taking
over
a
bit
goes
down
easy
with
medium
high
carbonation
nicely
crafted
beer
now
someone
trade
me
a
fresh
one
nye
bottle
share
at
proof
courtesy
of
masterson
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazy
yellow
orange
healthy
amount
of
white
head
with
a
very
thick
collar
both
of
which
lasted
pretty
dang
well
aroma
is
floral
slightly
sweet
malt
good
amount
of
sweet
citrus
mediumlight
body
and
same
carbonation
taste
is
overly
floral
some
pine
again
with
the
citrusy
hops
the
balance
in
the
nose
is
not
there
on
the
tongue
o
real
good
stuff
its
not
too
complex
but
is
so
smooth
and
clean
i
feel
healthier
just
drinking
this
d
a
little
hard
to
describe
like
an
elegant
refined
pale
ale
all
the
hop
flavor
without
over
the
top
bitterness
or
sweetness
excellent
overall
another
very
good
and
really
hoppy
beer
from
this
brewer
a
tad
pricey
but
you
can
tell
that
there
are
some
quality
ingredients
being
used
it
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
the
founders
all
day
ipa
solid
beer
even
at
7
49
per
o
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
else
maine
brewing
puts
out
but
for
6
a
bottle
i
suppose
i
was
expecting
more
but
it
is
one
solid
pale
ale

you

i
could
go
through
a
pint
of
this
in
a
few
minutes
without
trying
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
well
rounded
great
pale
ale
o
super
pysched
this
beer
has
come
to
chicago
my
best
friend
has
a
great
trading
partner
who
lives
in
maine
so
ive
had
a
few
maine
bee
co
brews
and
they
have
all
been
solid
i
love
clear
date
stamping
on
the
bottle
and
the
additional
recommendation
of
number
of
days
to
best
enough
the
beer
by
purchased
on
112
bot
said
drink
within
32days
of
1022
everything
is
correct
with
this
pale
ale
love
the
flavors
of
citrus
and
pine
with
the
additional
notes
of
spice
andor
herbal
andor
floral
the
6
abv
is
perfect
and
in
the
right
portion
with
a
17oz
bottle
and
its
a
clean
and
refreshing
beer
to
drink
i
know
this
statement
might
be
challenging
but
i
had
a
fresh
pliny
the
elder
a
week
ago
and
i
think
the
brews
from
maine
bc
are
on
par
with
the
wc
powerhouse
overall
a
great
easy
drinking
pale
that
is
certainly
overpriced
but
definitely
enjoyed
o
impeccable
american
pale
ale
excellent
complexity
and
balance
just
awesome
overall
this
really
shows
what
a
pale
ale
can
taste
like
certainly
doesnt
have
the
ibus
of
an
ipa
but
the
hop
flavor
shines
a
must
try
by
anyone
even
those
who
normally
shy
away
from
hoppier
beers
bottled
on
7302013
consumed
about
95
days
after
a
bit
beyond
the
recommended
time
frame
regardless
i
cant
find
a
single
flaw
with
this
bitter
exotic
fruit
flavored
pale
ale
absolutely
love
it
will
definitely
try
it
again
when
i
can
find
it
fresher
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
white
head
great
head
retention
that
leaves
a
thin
blanket
of
lacing
good
amount
of
carbonation
coming
off
the
glass
smells
of
more
citrus
fruits
up
front
like
grapefruit
and
orange
then
beneath
that
there
are
some
tropical
fruits
like
pineapple
and
mango
as
well
as
a
tiny
hint
of
pine
and
floral
the
malt
imparts
a
sweet
breadiness
note
that
makes
the
fruit
aromas
seem
more
juicier
taste
is
outstanding
reminds
me
of
a
hill
farmstead
beer
starts
with
hefty
doses
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
orange
notes
the
the
middle
brings
a
crackery
bready
sweet
malt
presence
that
balances
quite
nice
with
the
increasing
bitter
yet
juicy
grapefruit
also
starting
to
get
tropical
fruit
notes
as
well
the
finish
brings
more
juicy
tropical
fruit
notes
like
pineapple
also
getting
more
juicy
grapefruit
and
a
good
amount
of
pine
definitely
detect
the
red
wheat
on
the
finish
as
well
getting
almost
like
a
bubblegum
flavor
bitter
but
not
as
aggressive
as
you
might
expect
inyourface
yet
delicate
from
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
as
well
as
the
clean
finish
medium
body
with
a
creamy
and
oily
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
perfect
as
it
refreshes
the
beer
and
cleanses
the
palate
which
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
ive
had
a
lot
of
amazing
pale
ales
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
those
glad
they
are
in
chicago
now
d
a
very
nice
pale
ale
really
dig
the
500ml
format
too
as
its
the
perfect
amount
for
one
serving
of
this
brew
really
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
is
held
in
check
its
really
nice
to
see
this
brewery
distributing
to
chicago
o
no
singular
element
of
this
blows
the
mind
but
in
the
same
way
that
lunch
or
sculpin
work
continuing
to
drink
it
will
reveal
a
very
elegant
refined
example
of
a
style
thats
mainly
reliant
on
brute
force
still
this
is
a
lot
of
money
for
a
simple
pale
ale
even
one
as
good
as
this
o
a
well
balanced
fresh
apa
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
pale
ale
love
how
much
hop
character
it
has
without
being
too
bitter
this
is
the
first
beer
from
maine
beer
co
to
land
in
il
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
lunch
im
a
big
fan
of
this
format
16
9
oz
500ml
as
opposed
to
bombers
although
not
a
big
fan
of
the
price
point
6
99
but
i
can
appreciate
they
are
a
member
of
1
for
the
planet
o
lovely
beer
price
is
a
bit
steep
though
for
what
is
ultimately
a
pretty
simple
pale
ale
o
another
great
ipa
and
a
go
to
were
it
not
for
the
high
prices
o
an
excellent
beer
from
maine
beer
co
happy
to
have
gotten
a
fresh
one
would
definitely
seek
out
again
although
it
is
a
little
pricey
clear
brilliant
gold
topped
with
a
huge
lumpy
white
head
of
thick
froth
sheets
of
lacing
big
fruity
hop
aromas
burst
from
the
glass
zesty
grapefruit
pineapple
and
pine
resin
over
a
little
sugar
cookie
malt
very
hoppy
and
fresh
flavor
like
a
pale
ale
should
have
much
like
peeper
things
start
out
oily
juicy
zesty
grapefruit
flowery
hops
resin
great
apa
flavor
ultra
drinkable
soft
yet
crisp
one
little
bottle
to
split
with
my
wife
is
not
enough
color
is
pale
gold
and
a
little
tangerine
orange
head
is
bright
white
and
foamy
nice
splotchy
lace
and
good
head
retention
aroma
is
loaded
with
juicy
grapefruit
some
pine
flowers
leaves
and
generally
tropical
like
peeper
a
mouthwatering
aroma
but
bigger
taste
is
fruity
tropical
zesty
grapefruity
piney
and
a
weeee
bit
herbal
mmmm
texture
is
grittylikeresiny
mixed
in
slickness
really
good
stuff
o
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
pale
ale
it
wasnt
very
complex
or
anything
but
it
was
a
good
tasting
beer
that
was
enjoyable
to
drink
in
the
pale
ale
realm
this
one
felt
on
the
lighter
side
of
both
bitterness
and
body
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
some
of
the
malt
in
there
but
it
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
served
in
a
16oz
pint
glass
at
the
pourhouse
westmont
nj
mo
isnt
as
complex
or
enjoyable
as
lunch
but
with
that
said
its
still
a
really
well
made
ipa
the
grapefruit
is
large
and
incharge
while
the
tight
grassy
bitterness
is
something
i
dont
come
across
very
often
in
ipas
if
youre
looking
for
something
bitter
and
easy
drinking
get
you
some
mo
overall
clean
and
crisp
pretty
much
what
i
expected
if
a
bit
dry
maine
has
a
good
setup
look
forward
to
trying
more
in
the
future
cheers
overall
this
bottle
is
a
couple
of
months
old
and
from
reading
the
other
reviews
i
suspect
the
hop
profile
on
this
one
fades
rather
quickly
a
very
nice
beer
but
i
am
not
digging
it
like
some
others
who
conceivably
had
a
fresher
example
pours
into
a
standard
pint
a
dull
medium
golden
with
a
large
blooming
white
headmaybe
a
little
over
carbonation
issue
juicy
grapefruit
in
the
nose
with
a
little
grassiness
as
wellnot
much
malt
profile
just
juicy
hops
maybe
the
best
hop
profile
of
any
standard
pale
i
have
had
flavorwisefresh
grapefruit
and
grassy
flavors
with
a
dryer
base
making
for
just
hoppy
goodness
a
tad
sharp
in
the
mouth
but
man
this
is
just
a
hopped
up
flavor
punch
of
an
apa
wow
o
solid
apa
that
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
leaves
you
wanting
more
with
every
sip
another
well
done
beer
by
this
brewery
which
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
despite
the
prices
mo
will
become
a
summer
staple
for
me
for
as
long
as
maine
beer
company
continues
to
send
it
my
direction
the
beer
is
golden
to
yellow
with
a
mild
haze
and
a
huge
white
frothy
head
the
aroma
brings
some
zesty
citrus
floral
notes
pine
a
light
sweetness
hop
forward
and
refreshing
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
big
floral
and
citrus
notes
oranges
and
lemons
with
a
touch
of
bitter
pine
finishing
dry
a
wonderful
pale
ale
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
6
99
per
500
ml
bottle
when
a
beer
of
this
ilk
should
be
912
per
sixer
for
that
reason
alone
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
as
tasty
as
it
is
nice
pale
ale
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
one
out
as
i
dont
enjoy
it
that
much
more
than
pale
ales
that
are
more
accessible
to
me
great
extra
thanks
buddy
tons
of
great
fresh
hop
aroma
great
crisp
clean
flavor
hopefully
going
to
get
some
super
fresh
from
the
brewery
soon
t
slightly
bitter
hoppy
and
all
that
good
stuff
tastes
a
lot
like
a
refined
ipa
rather
than
a
pale
ale
i
also
detect
some
qualities
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
that
are
usually
common
in
dipas
and
at
only
6
and
easily
sessionable
im
in
heaven
regardless
of
abv
this
is
a
gem
anything
above
93
rating
on
ba
usually
is
do
try
it
if
you
have
a
chance
as
im
finishing
this
glass
a
waitress
brought
another
beer
along
the
same
style
to
sample
i
can
already
tell
this
is
going
to
be
a
bumpy
ride
thick
rich
body
for
a
pale
ale
good
carbonation
a
little
sticky
but
the
medium
plays
it
down
a
bit
in
a
good
way
for
balance
citrus
peels
with
a
faint
touch
of
tobacco
earthy
meets
bright
citrus
fruits
with
a
solid
sweet
malt
backbone
throughout
simple
and
subtle
yet
packed
with
flavor
slowly
building
bitterness
but
balanced
by
a
lingering
malt
sweetness
quite
the
pale
ale
but
like
everything
else
maine
its
just
a
tease
a
beer
is
rather
have
in
a
6
id
even
pay
stone
4
pack
prices
for
their
stuff
o
decent
pale
ale
had
high
expectations
but
was
mostly
disappointed
in
the
end
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
has
some
staying
power
lots
of
lacing
very
citrusy
on
the
nose
redolent
of
grapefruit
and
tangerines
mild
sweet
malt
notes
in
background
subtle
sweetness
with
some
citrusy
hops
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
some
bitterness
finishes
bitter
but
not
overly
so
malty
sweetness
provides
the
right
amount
of
balance
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
a
well
crafted
balanced
pale
ale
that
is
almost
hoppy
enough
to
be
an
ipa
another
great
beer
from
maine
o
an
outstanding
american
pale
that
is
almost
nothing
but
a
showcase
for
strong
citrus
hops
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
very
enjoyable
grapefruit
character
this
was
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
thanks
guy
in
the
liquor
store
that
i
made
small
talk
with
for
recommending
this
beer
for
a
labor
day
treat
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottled
on
70913
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
sticky
white
billowy
head
that
leaves
behind
amazing
lace
smell
is
tangerine
mango
pineapple
and
earthy
hops
taste
is
all
about
citrus
and
a
little
grapefruit
in
the
finish
that
lingers
a
bit
body
is
medium
for
the
style
nice
amount
of
life
a
little
dry
and
great
drinkability
very
nice
beer
as
you
would
expect
from
this
company
o
a
great
session
ale
perfect
for
the
summer
resiny
taste
and
great
lacing
the
malt
and
body
here
is
very
nice
and
belies
its
relatively
light
color
biscuity
and
a
bit
chewy
perfect
carbonation
level
coats
the
palate
hype
be
damned
this
backs
it
up
better
than
expected
im
going
to
shut
up
and
enjoy
the
rest
even
better
than
lunch
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
made
in
maine
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
an
orange
glow
the
head
isnt
much
white
and
airy
but
not
lasting
real
long
the
nose
is
like
fresh
pineapple
juice
not
bitter
at
all
real
tropical
and
real
fresh
reminds
me
of
hill
farmstead
or
lawsons
stuff
east
coast
and
hoppy
but
more
than
high
alcohol
oily
dankness
its
insane
how
good
this
is
a
veritable
fruit
punch
of
hop
flavors
lemon
and
grapefruit
too
i
love
the
intensity
of
it
while
staying
not
too
bitter
jazzy
carbonation
clean
finish
and
feel
as
good
as
any
american
pale
on
the
market
i
think
the
lightness
is
what
impresses
me
most
i
could
drink
this
forever
and
my
10
ounce
pour
just
isnt
enough
all
beers
on
at
maine
beer
company
were
tasty
great
examples
of
their
respective
styles
but
this
to
me
was
the
pick
of
the
litter
already
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
whenever
i
may
be
so
lucky
a
true
gem
a
very
hoppy
nose
and
great
beer
it
was
a
very
welcomed
surprise
as
we
do
not
get
many
maine
beers
down
this
way
it
held
up
well
to
other
beers
as
well
as
i
had
just
come
from
an
ipa
tasting
this
beer
vanquished
the
ones
i
had
just
tried
and
set
up
shop
on
my
palate
the
taste
also
had
a
good
hop
flavor
although
the
roasted
malts
were
a
but
more
forward
in
the
taste
than
on
the
nose
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
o
a
nice
pale
ale
hoppy
but
balanced
22
oz
bottle
pours
hazygolden
with
long
lasting
foamy
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
biscuit
malt
and
orange
marmalade
body
is
medium
and
tangy
citrusy
floral
hops
biscuit
malt
yeast
and
ripe
fruit
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
bitter
delicious
brew
not
digging
this
one
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
very
enjoyable
really
good
and
quite
unique
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
tag
though
but
worth
trying
mo
is
a
great
pale
ale
yet
again
another
great
beer
from
the
maine
beer
company
i
am
surprised
this
beer
and
others
from
this
brewery
are
not
rated
higher
it
had
a
great
pale
ale
taste
smooth
and
hopi
is
a
great
combination
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
crisp
and
there
is
alot
of
piney
hop
resin
t
starts
with
a
nice
crisp
piny
hop
bite
then
brings
some
pepper
and
grapefruit
rind
a
really
great
pale
7
for
500
ml
bottle
o
a
very
good
pale
but
the
malt
could
come
through
in
the
nose
and
mouth
yep
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
refreshing
enough
for
a
hot
day
the
only
negative
is
the
price
but
i
would
buy
this
one
again
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
another
one
that
walks
a
thin
line
between
american
pale
ale
and
ipa
but
im
really
liking
it
no
matter
how
you
classify
it
i
highly
recommend
checking
it
out
ps
just
drank
the
dregs
which
allegedly
included
the
bottle
conditioning
yeast
and
it
was
really
smooth
nice
going
maine
brewers
overall
a
delicious
apa
refreshing
o
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
very
happy
with
it
low
alcohol
content
which
means
its
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
can
see
enjoying
this
next
to
the
ocean
or
pool
i
will
absolutely
buy
this
again
and
im
very
lucky
to
have
it
close
to
me
now
but
will
seek
it
out
when
i
move
this
is
unreal
for
a
pale
ale
ive
never
had
zombie
dust
but
the
bar
has
just
been
raised
yet
again
my
girlfriend
and
i
we
love
mo
i
absolutely
wouldve
brought
more
than
one
bottle
home
from
that
total
wine
in
fair
fax
virginia
only
they
didnt
have
more
than
one
heres
hoping
i
stumble
upon
a
bounty
of
this
particular
brew
for
someone
who
is
not
big
on
american
pale
ales
id
stock
the
fridge
with
this
all
summer
i
couldnt
imagine
getting
sick
of
this
o
a
solid
west
coast
style
pale
ale
o
4
overall
this
is
only
the
second
beer
ive
tried
from
maine
beer
company
and
it
definitely
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
it
was
ok
but
definitely
not
something
ill
rush
to
try
again
ill
take
snpa
over
this
all
day
500ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
rather
large
fizzy
head
on
it
that
lingered
a
bit
and
left
some
lacing
it
has
a
nice
nose
a
lot
is
going
on
there
get
some
apricot
spices
pine
notes
as
the
main
players
the
taste
is
very
good
just
a
hint
of
the
apricot
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
good
malt
body
behind
it
with
no
sweetness
coming
through
glad
to
see
their
beers
making
it
past
the
borders
now
slightly
hazes
faint
apricot
colored
with
a
firm
head
of
tight
foam
that
lingers
long
and
settles
out
slowly
inviting
aroma
of
citrus
and
honey
some
pine
flavor
matches
the
nose
very
citrusy
full
of
tangerine
and
melon
hints
of
mint
sappy
pine
grapefruit
rind
and
honey
finishes
dry
pine
and
orange
rind
itch
lingers
great
beer
pretty
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
verdict
a
damn
fine
apa
from
maine
beer
company
bright
vibrant
with
a
great
earthy
balance
its
clean
simple
and
refreshing
yet
easily
satisfies
any
hop
craving
o
very
tasty
goes
down
extremely
easy
not
too
filling
decent
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
whole
evening
pours
a
nice
straw
color
a
bit
hazy
with
a
solid
head
great
looking
beer
the
smell
is
not
even
close
to
over
powering
but
its
nice
just
a
light
citrusy
hop
smell
classic
american
pale
ale
the
taste
is
nice
too
but
the
citrusy
side
of
the
hops
is
muted
a
bit
and
instead
you
get
more
bitterness
that
i
would
expect
in
a
beer
of
this
style
still
its
a
great
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
fine
all
in
all
a
very
nice
apa
it
actually
reminds
me
of
founders
all
day
but
its
more
bitter
has
less
hop
aroma
and
taste
and
it
costs
about
3
times
as
much
thats
why
even
though
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
beer
again
i
probably
wont
o
very
very
well
done
yet
another
offering
from
mbc
that
impresses
me
o
it
has
something
of
a
similar
feel
as
a
heady
topper
but
more
reserved
very
refreshing
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
grapefruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
very
nice
citrus
aromas
and
flavors
nice
honey
colored
ale
with
a
solid
persistent
quilt
of
soapy
whites
atop
nose
is
pretty
simple
some
resin
some
pine
some
grapfruit
pith
and
light
english
malting
taste
follows
suite
with
some
decent
bitterness
a
good
resiny
piney
pnwey
character
and
a
sweet
tea
malt
backbone
tastes
more
english
aggressive
than
apa
to
me
but
i
dig
medium
bodied
with
fluffy
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
not
sure
what
the
price
is
on
this
but
on
tap
at
average
prices
id
probably
slam
a
good
several
annually
with
one
night
probably
being
pretty
top
heavy
poured
cloudy
lemony
orange
with
a
frothy
head
of
soft
foam
that
would
not
go
away
fell
to
some
crags
and
great
lace
nose
was
pine
sweet
citrus
tangerine
candy
sugar
toffee
malt
and
a
little
pepper
a
little
soap
too
taste
was
juicy
citrus
grapefruit
rinds
and
pithy
lemon
a
tad
astringent
and
peppery
nutty
toasted
malt
and
finished
with
lots
of
floral
dry
and
bitter
and
somewhat
thin
it
was
worth
trying
and
i
liked
it
but
not
as
much
as
everyone
else
m
medium
body
sticky
moderate
carbonation
o
a
welldone
apa
a
workingmans
beer
nothing
to
fancy
just
wellmade
suitable
for
bars
bbqs
and
boating
and
all
forms
of
outdoor
action
o
excellent
o
this
is
a
fantastic
wellcrafted
citrusy
apa
with
ipas
and
dipas
being
all
the
rage
right
now
this
should
not
be
overlooked
after
smelling
mo
i
was
really
excited
for
what
was
about
to
follow
unfortunately
both
the
flavor
profile
and
the
mouthfeel
were
quite
disappointing
loved
this
one
will
have
mo
again
tap
poured
a
light
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
consists
of
citrus
notes
with
some
floral
hoppy
notes
also
perceptible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
citrus
notes
with
some
floral
hoppy
notes
and
some
citrus
notes
with
lightly
sweet
nondescript
malt
base
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
really
like
the
take
on
this
one
with
nice
floral
aroma
notes
and
limited
bitterness
o
a
wonderfully
light
and
flavorful
pale
ale
that
has
exceptional
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
as
i
would
work
it
into
my
summer
rotation
of
daisy
cutter
and
zombie
dust
overall
drinkability
is
great
on
this
one
a
nice
light
apa
to
drink
as
the
day
cools
off
the
nose
smells
like
a
fruit
salad
and
the
citrus
hops
are
a
real
thirst
quencher
however
the
hops
arent
too
heavy
handed
and
the
malt
backs
them
up
quite
nicely
this
is
one
to
go
after
this
summer
overall
a
spectacular
brew
one
of
the
best
apas
there
out
very
nice
to
be
able
to
try
one
ov
a
rather
exceptionally
flavourful
beer
where
you
can
taste
each
little
nuance
throughout
the
enjoyment
of
it
a
superb
effort
from
maine
beer
please
send
more
beer
to
nj
thanks

this
is
a
very
solid
pale
ale
though
i
admit
i
was
expecting
something
much
more
lush
and
juicybut
whats
in
the
glass
is
crisp
grassy
dry
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
the
aroma
is
fantastic
and
to
be
honest
thats
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
palate
but
at
least
with
this
bottle
thats
not
the
case
but
yknow
what
still
pretty
tasty
o
awesome
pale
ale
for
sure
ive
yet
to
experience
a
bad
beer
by
maine
brewing
co
on
tap
pours
a
burnt
golden
orange
in
the
glass
with
a
finger
of
brightwhite
head
this
stay
smooth
and
creamy
looking
leaving
back
a
robust
smattering
of
lacing
behind
smells
fresh
and
floral
with
a
little
dankness
and
pine
mixed
in
lot
of
juicy
tropical
fruit
notes
taste
has
a
zesty
grapefruit
bitterness
with
a
resinous
finish
sticky
notes
of
fruit
herbal
flavors
and
neutral
malt
sweetness
do
a
tremendous
job
of
balancing
and
adding
extra
flavor
to
this
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
firm
and
sharp
feel
in
the
mouth
which
is
undercut
by
just
the
right
amount
of
creaminess
this
was
really
nice
an
apa
with
a
good
bit
of
aggressive
to
it
yet
was
still
extremely
well
balanced
with
those
tropical
passion
fruit
flavors
in
particular
really
standing
out
well
worth
checking
out
cheers
overall
what
a
great
brew
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
would
100
recommend
this
would
be
absolutely
amazing
for
a
summer
cookout
or
something
or
whenever
you
want
to
feel
like
you
are
at
one
i
have
to
give
this
beer
high
drinkability
marks
because
its
light
bodied
easily
drinkable
and
filled
with
great
flavors
i
got
this
beer
in
a
trade
so
im
not
quite
sure
of
the
price
would
i
drink
it
again
i
sure
would
this
is
my
second
maine
beer
co
beer
and
ive
been
very
impressed
with
both
of
them
the
ones
i
had
make
me
want
to
try
their
other
offerings
i
like
the
beer
and
its
the
fresh
hops
this
is
what
this
beer
is
about
like
many
other
american
beers
it
focuses
too
much
on
the
great
hops
this
country
produces
and
forgets
about
balance
or
modesty
learn
from
the
belgiums

o
great
apa
just
wish
it
didnt
cost
so
much
or
else
id
be
drinking
this
throughout
the
summer

thanks
to
drewshal9
for
this
one
overall
tasty
a
nice
apa
flavourful
yet
fairly
mild
looks
good
on
the
pour
nice
citrus
nose
good
punch
on
the
mouth
in
a
refined
way
thats
how
i
would
define
this
beer
refined
its
not
overdoing
it
just
for
the
sake
of
things
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
and
biting
but
overall
a
very
nice
drinker
o
at
first
the
nose
made
me
think
of
american
ipa
but
it
is
truly
a
properly
ampedup
apa
finding
that
many
of
the
top
ranked
new
england
brews
worth
trying
simply
arent
available
in
a
six
pack
but
that
doesnt
mean
they
arent
worth
the
price
tag
if
the
bottom
line
is
quality
overall
a
balmy
hop
bomb
that
lulls
the
palate
to
sleep
with
the
dulling
body
there
is
some
very
good
balance
in
this
easy
drinking
brew
i
recommend
this
to
pair
with
many
other
beers
maine
beer
puts
out
many
quality
brews
this
is
definitely
among
them
o
overall
a
6
pale
ale
i
guess
some
would
consider
it
an
ipa
the
balance
light
body
and
drinkablility
definitely
say
pale
ale
and
a
damn
good
one
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
hoppy
and
light
refreshing
and
smooth
not
bitterness
excellent
pale
ale
right
up
there
with
the
big
boys
from
three
floyds
that
ive
had
even
right
at
the
brink
of
the
bestby
date
this
is
fantastic
overall
4
75
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
but
its
really
more
of
an
ipa
still
really
good
under
that
style
not
much
to
detract
from
this
one
gotta
pick
this
one
up
if
you
havent
yet
not
sure
what
took
me
so
long
well
worth
the
steep
price
tag
very
dry
aromatic
and
refreshing
this
would
be
an
ideal
apa
for
the
summer
months
looking
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
maine
beer
company
4
week
old
bottle
from
wineworks
aroma
is
fresh
pine
grass
and
a
lemon
zest
pours
opaque
and
golden
with
a
huge
foamy
head
taste
is
delightful
with
citrus
notes
grass
and
a
slight
pine
underneath
mouthfeel
was
a
little
muddled
and
busy
but
the
hops
shine
through
overall
this
was
wonderful
and
tasty
love
it
taste
is
similar
very
cleans
refreshing
but
with
a
very
complex
hop
favor
begins
with
a
resinous
quality
and
turns
over
to
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
the
malt
is
not
complex
but
provides
a
wonderful
bread
like
background
tying
it
all
together
very
drinkable
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
yet
a
creamy
impression
very
enjoyable
and
much
appreciated
beer
o
a
spectacular
pale
ale
it
emphasizes
what
an
apa
should
its
isnt
so
intense
that
you
think
it
should
be
an
ipa
like
dales
can
be
some
times
and
it
is
perfectly
balanced
and
very
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
no
question
man
does
this
do
down
easy
really
need
to
find
me
some
lunch
note
bottled
on
12814
and
drank
on
21314
so
it
was
super
fresh
maybe
not
quite
up
there
with
zombie
dust
and
boneafide
but
nevertheless
this
is
an
excellent
well
made
pale
ale
i
just
wish
it
were
available
where
i
live
o
good
stuff
well
executed
i
appreciate
the
lack
of
bitterness
this
succeeds
as
a
moderately
hoppy
pa
and
does
well
with
food
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
the
label
the
way
it
looks
the
way
it
tastes
this
is
an
expertly
crafted
pale
ale
a
bit
of
a
larger
malt
backbone
could
really
give
this
beer
some
incredible
balance
and
bump
it
up
to
world
class
but
this
was
meant
to
be
a
hoppy
beer
and
maine
beer
co
has
succeeded
in
creating
such
i
could
drink
this
every
day

a
all
round
well
done
pale
ale
recommend
a
bottle
maybe
a
little
too
expensive
for
bulk
purchases
a
solid
pale
ale
id
really
like
to
revisit
this
super
fresh
because
im
betting
its
something
magical
look
forward
to
more
from
maine
o
what
a
sublime
beer
flavors
and
aromas
are
bright
and
balanced
powerful
yet
subdued
this
sets
a
new
mark
for
pale
ales

d
would
really
like
to
try
this
fresher
but
was
still
impressed
with
the
taste
profile
and
dynamic
aroma
maybe
not
their
best
offering
but
that
being
said
an
excellent
addition
to
the
maine
beer
co
family
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
like
all
maine
beer
co
beers
make
sure
you
check
the
bottled
daye
before
buying
their
stuff
in
nyc
or
it
might
be
months
old
this
one
holds
up
much
better
than
23
month
old
bottles
of
peeper
and
zoe
but
i
get
the
feeling
this
could
be
great
if
you
got
it
super
fresh
still
a
lot
of
nice
fruit
and
citrus
and
something
id
certainly
revisit
if
i
saw
a
fresh
bottleit
on
tap
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
beer
but
i
think
their
peeper
ale
is
the
better
of
the
two
my
main
problem
with
mo
is
that
the
flavor
comes
on
too
strongly
o
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
was
crafted
right
overall
easy
to
drink
a
good
american
pale
ale
tone
down
the
lemoncitrus
aroma
and
flavor
just
a
slight
bit
and
this
beer
would
be
excellent
from
the
simplistic
label
to
the
smell
all
the
way
to
the
last
drop
this
is
a
wonderful
experience
i
think
this
beer
will
become
a
legend
people
will
find
out
about
it
and
make
this
a
mecca
for
beer
drinkers
great
beer
thanks
again
to
crabbicus
for
this
o
a
very
nice
wellconstructed
apa
easy
drinker
o
what
a
fantastic
pale
ale
but
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
such
a
solid
brewery
a
great
pale
ale
this
is
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
and
damn
well
worth
the
wait
seems
like
a
very
basic
recipe
but
is
perfectly
executed
no
off
flavors
everything
tastes
extremely
fresh
o
a
fine
very
tasty
and
balanced
pale
ale
the
aroma
suggests
more
of
a
hop
presence
than
the
taste
delivers
but
its
still
quite
good
got
this
as
an
extra
from
a
generous
ba
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
orange
color
large
white
head
i
also
see
a
lot
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
this
bottle
this
bottle
is
definitely
unfiltered
and
bottleconditioned
scent
is
wow
blown
away
by
this
aroma
very
reminiscent
of
the
hoppy
beers
im
familiar
with
in
santa
rosa
awesome
tropical
aromas
i
actually
pick
up
mangos
in
this
one
along
with
grapefruit
honeydew
pineapple
and
orange
peel
not
an
ounce
of
maltiness
does
the
east
side
know
what
theyre
doing
now
taste
is
just
as
great
by
far
one
of
the
most
flavorful
and
tasty
pale
ales
in
the
same
family
as
daisy
cutter
row
2
hoppy
birthday
zombie
dust
and
happy
hops
the
flavors
are
spot
on
from
the
nose
no
overwhelming
maltiness
amazing
hop
flavors
with
the
right
amount
of
citrus
pine
and
bitterness
i
love
when
such
a
sessionable
beer
packs
such
a
flavor
punch
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
drinkability
is
crazy
high
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
but
im
onto
them
theyre
smart
they
realize
the
success
of
russian
river
and
theyre
using
them
as
a
model
simple
labels
500ml
bottles
emphasize
the
drink
now
aspect
and
make
the
beer
taste
damn
good
much
respect
for
maine
beer
company
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
beers
from
them
and
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
stuff
out
medium
bodied
with
dry
sticky
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
and
pale
malts
into
a
dry
finish
theres
a
decent
amount
of
tropicalcitrus
sweetness
but
it
isnt
as
prominent
as
the
nose
suggests
more
of
an
earthyfloral
character
than
expected
overpowering
hints
of
pineapple
orange
peel
and
grapefruit
decent
malt
backbone
but
it
doesnt
hinder
the
hop
flavors
giving
off
hints
of
biscuit
and
cracker
well
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
for
my
taste
pours
orange
bodied
with
a
lasting
bubbly
off
white
head
great
smell
grapefruit
and
oranges
smooth
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
creamy
very
tasty
orange
creamy
good
hoppyness
the
proof
is
in
the
taste
and
this
is
an
excellent
american
pale
from
capones
restaurant
add
more
pine
body
and
aroma
and
youll
have
something
almost
identical
to
pliny
the
elder
d
wow
this
is
some
good
shit
highly
fruity
very
drinkable
wouldnt
hate
more
a
lot
more
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
takes
forever
to
recede
and
leaves
lots
of
stickies
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aromas
of
citrus
fill
the
air
as
soon
as
i
tilt
the
bottle
toward
the
glass
pine
and
resin
with
a
hint
of
bread
round
out
the
nose
quite
nicely
the
flavor
is
light
bread
cracker
and
a
hint
of
seltzer
water
with
a
nice
pine
and
grapefruit
flavor
going
on
theres
a
solid
shot
of
bitterness
in
this
one
im
guessing
because
the
body
is
a
bit
light
to
stand
up
to
the
massive
hopping
here
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
watery
and
resinous
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
nice
pale
ale
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
especially
with
the
heavy
dose
of
hops
in
here
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
moderate
carbonation
very
good
beer
overall
the
hoppiness
was
really
nice
especially
the
juicy
tropical
notes
very
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
great
apa
overall
o
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
worth
trying
finally
can
buy
mbc
near
me
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
beers
and
be
able
to
buy
this
again
drink
just
a
very
good
beer
right
on
par
with
zd
and
hoppy
birthday
in
the
hoppy
pale
ale
category
super
refreshing
would
love
more
of
this
the
hops
are
a
little
clashy
on
the
palate
there
is
simultaneously
a
strong
fruity
hoppy
sense
with
this
other
pine
hop
flavors
they
dont
play
well
really
well
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
id
ditch
the
pine
hops
and
just
make
a
second
pale
ale
with
those
hops
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
moderately
bitter
at
the
back
a
good
beer
minimal
malt
character
no
sweetness
id
have
this
again
especially
on
draft
o
a
fine
beer
that
i
think
is
benefiting
from
the
freshness
under
3
weeks
since
bottling
delicious
with
a
lot
of
hops
aroma
and
flavor
with
relatively
low
bitterness
and
ample
maltiness
to
support
the
pleasant
hoppiness
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
dry
hopping
with
amarillo
centennial
and
simcoe
i
would
guess
by
the
bright
nose
and
flavor
great
job
maine
beer
i
like
this
one
even
better
than
peeper
which
was
also
quite
good
this
is
probably
one
of
my
top
5
apas
drinks
very
much
like
an
extra
pale
ale
because
it
is
very
light
but
with
more
layered
hoppiness
o
way
hopped
up
for
a
pale
ale
and
i
love
it
the
hop
presence
is
something
you
would
encounter
in
an
ipa
or
with
some
higher
alcohol
beers
lighter
bodied
crisp
and
at
6
i
could
drink
these
all
day
hop
heads
seek
this
one
out
o
a
really
nice
pale
ale
very
light
and
drinkable
with
some
really
nice
hop
flavors
going
on
so
far
i
havent
had
a
single
beer
from
maine
beer
co
that
i
havent
really
enjoyed
o
goes
does
easy
very
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
perhaps
a
bit
hoppier
than
typical
apas
though
works
really
well
for
this
beer
overall
a
great
brew
glad
i
finally
opened
this
one
mediumlight
body
medium
carbonation
smooth
feel
drinks
just
about
perfect
for
this
style
very
impressive
these
guys
are
doing
excellent
really
topnotch
work
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
effervescent
yet
it
is
soft
enough
on
the
tongue
to
not
distract
and
help
move
the
flavors
across
the
tongue
the
6
abv
is
very
well
integrated
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
again
i
can
only
image
that
this
brew
is
pretty
awesome
the
fresher
it
is
since
this
is
the
freshest
i
have
been
able
to
get
one
i
can
only
call
it
as
it
is
it
is
good
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
no
questions
asked
if
it
was
fresher
than
3
months
old
of
course
overall
what
a
spectacular
brew
maine
beer
company
needs
to
keep
it
up
all
the
beers
from
them
so
far
have
wowed
me
in
being
some
of
the
best
so
far
definatly
will
have
this
one
again
full
frontal
flavor
bud
assault
from
the
hops
but
it
cleans
up
just
enough
to
keep
from
drying
out
the
palate
from
the
bitterness
loaded
with
pinecitrus
hops
more
than
enough
to
sate
the
hop
fiend
a
decent
pale
ale
that
is
well
worth
checking
out
fresh
that
is
if
you
read
the
bottle
it
certainly
shows
but
the
carbonation
bothers
me
then
again
it
could
just
be
me
and
not
the
beer
itself
another
solid
offering
from
mbc
o
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
but
i
wish
the
taste
and
feel
were
on
par
with
the
smell
really
this
seems
to
compete
with
most
nonwest
coast
ipas
to
me
worth
buying
if
you
come
across
it
body
sits
a
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
cap
with
a
good
amount
of
clinging
lace
some
small
sip
marks
inside
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
undercooked
biscuits
and
light
earth
with
some
tropical
fruits
over
top
the
hops
seemed
a
little
overpowered
by
the
malt
like
they
are
struggling
for
a
little
bit
of
the
spotlight
on
the
palate
tropical
fruits
pineapple
papaya
and
mango
make
a
run
early
before
a
sweeping
rush
of
biscuity
malt
and
soft
earth
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
lightly
sweet
from
the
tropical
fruits
this
is
a
nice
apa
wellbalanced
highly
drinkable
and
even
though
this
is
6
i
could
drink
this
all
day
an
incredible
apa
maine
beer
co
really
knows
what
theyre
doing
with
their
hoppy
beers
this
along
with
peeper
are
some
of
the
best
examples
of
what
a
pale
ale
can
be
pours
a
very
nice
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
onefinger
plus
white
creamy
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
slight
malt
blend
citrus
and
some
pine
notes
the
taste
is
very
nice
hoppy
a
little
malts
thrown
in
nice
citrus
and
slight
pine
note
medium
body
with
a
nice
drybitter
finish
overall
a
very
nice
brew
o
another
job
well
done
by
maine
beer
company
some
might
find
the
8
expensive
for
the
bottle
but
i
find
it
well
worth
it
i
think
its
somewhat
similar
to
the
peeper
ale
and
would
like
to
do
a
tasting
side
by
side
to
find
those
subtle
differences
pick
this
up
if
you
can
o
its
a
solid
beer
that
is
just
not
worth
5
for
a
16
9
ounce
bottle
when
zombie
dust
can
be
had
for
1012
for
a
six
pack
still
a
good
oneoff
buy
and
recommended
to
try
once
for
an
interesting
hop
medley
the
only
knock
on
this
beer
was
that
its
expensive
around
8
for
a
16
oz
bottle
but
after
the
last
sip
it
justified
the
price
as
this
was
an
excellent
beer
maine
beer
company
is
3
for
3
in
my
book
with
all
3
beers
that
ive
tried
from
this
brewer
have
been
excellent
a
very
high
recommendation
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
bright
crystal
clear
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
bright
white
filmy
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
resiny
bitter
pungent
green
hops
with
piney
overtones
smells
delicious
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
bitter
overtone
that
is
undercut
by
a
citrus
and
bready
backbone
both
lemon
zest
and
buttery
biscuit
support
the
heavy
dose
of
hops
character
that
quickly
gives
way
to
an
effervescent
light
crisp
aftertaste
the
flavors
are
so
huge
initially
that
it
almost
seems
like
it
disappears
on
the
backend
clean
crisp
finish
makes
this
beer
an
incredibly
easy
drinker
nicely
put
together
but
a
little
abrupt
on
the
ending
the
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
nice
big
creamy
head
that
pusses
down
to
a
rocky
fingers
width
leaving
slight
spots
and
clouds
of
sticky
lacing
the
beer
is
hazy
and
torrential
with
bubbles
of
carbonation
racing
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
beer
smells
fat
and
juicy
it
is
drizzling
with
citrus
mango
pine
and
slight
pineapple
there
is
a
great
buttery
biscuit
smell
lying
below
the
fruity
hops
and
giving
the
beer
a
great
body
this
smell
is
very
enticing
the
beer
tastes
like
a
mellower
version
of
the
smell
but
its
a
little
disappointing
the
initial
sip
dances
with
some
of
those
wonderful
hops
but
rushes
away
quickly
and
is
replaced
by
vegetal
bitters
the
taste
overall
is
bitter
and
average
there
is
a
great
bitter
taste
at
the
middle
with
a
little
stale
biscuit
taste
that
lasts
in
the
mouth
and
reminds
me
of
a
bitter
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
velvety
sitting
quite
nicely
on
the
tongue
and
leaving
the
mouth
with
a
nice
skim
of
saliva
and
a
little
dry
the
only
problem
is
the
earthy
almost
vegetal
bitter
aftertaste
that
tingles
through
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
apa
that
is
hurt
by
its
aftertaste
the
smell
is
to
die
for
and
might
be
my
new
favorite
smell
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
follow
up
this
is
another
good
offering
from
maine
beer
company
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
ones
ive
tried
to
be
fair
i
must
admit
that
apas
are
not
my
favorite
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
smell
and
continues
the
excellence
that
this
nanobrewery
has
developed
very
drinkable
beer
i
can
see
this
pairing
well
with
food
although
i
didnt
here
my
only
beef
is
that
this
seems
very
familiar
this
beer
is
in
a
good
high
tier
but
is
very
similar
to
others
i
dont
know
if
i
could
pick
it
out
from
some
similar
brew
it
lacks
that
unique
edge
that
makes
you
say
thats
a
maine
beer
co
brew
i
know
im
nitpicking
overall
these
brewers
have
put
together
another
great
beer
a
real
winner
try
this
pours
a
dirtywater
yellowish
orange
with
an
absolutely
huge
bright
white
head
head
sticks
around
and
peter
norths
the
glass
on
the
way
down
aroma
of
fresh
citrus
hops
and
plenty
of
them
orange
lemon
and
grapefruit
also
a
nice
sweet
subtle
malt
aroma
very
refreshing
smell
this
brewery
never
disappoints
perfect
true
to
the
style
hoppy
pale
ale
nice
range
of
hop
flavors
bursts
of
grapefruit
orange
nice
lemongrass
kick
really
mild
pine
notes
and
a
nice
sweet
malt
no
one
huge
flavor
but
perfection
perfect
blend
of
flavors
perfect
cohesion
very
light
crisp
but
packs
a
huge
flavor
punch
while
still
being
light
grab
a
bunch
of
these
and
enjoy
great
flavor
big
drinkability

cloudy
orange
color
with
an
inch
of
fluffy
white

some

fantastic
whiff

the
flavor
is
just
as
the
aroma

and
orange

followed
by
tropical
fruits
mango
and
pineapple
most
nnotably
nice

slightly

overall
amazing
pale
ale
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
more
one
day
these
guys
will
brew
a
crappy
beer
until
then
ill
continue
to
enjoy
whatever
they
put
into
bottles
this
one
is
a
bit
less
prickly
and
spicy
than
their
peeper
ale
but
is
no
less
refreshing
enough
hops
to
put
it
at
the
edge
of
my
liking
but
also
enough
fruity
orangeylemony
to
make
it
worth
my
while
and
the
fizz
and
the
puffy
white
head
take
two
they
sell
out
quickly
light
body
with
a
refreshing
effervescence
very
easy
to
drink
even
if
the
abv
is
on
the
higher
range
for
a
pale
ale
another
nice
beer
from
maine
beer
company
o
this
beer
has
lots
of
hoppy
aromas
and
flavors
like
an
ipa
but
is
very
to
drink
since
it
is
an
apa
o
this
beer
is
incredibly
enjoyable
a
delicious
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
very
enticing
wonderful
tropical
hops
i
found
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
strong
in
abv
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
enjoyable
sitting
back
and
having
a
couple
of
these
overall
almost
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
apa
but
still
another
delicious
mbc
brew
worth
checking
out
as
interesting
beer
to
compare
with
lunch
m
surprisingly
light
bodied
maybe
inching
to
medium
but
really
refreshing
and
light
bottle
o
excellent
pale
ale
here
from
mbc
its
very
refreshing
and
balanced
and
just
a
really
delicious
and
quality
made
brew
much
like
the
other
offerings
from
these
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
mbc
the
big
thing
though
very
low
bitterness
with
all
the
hop
flavor
all
the
beers
ive
had
from
mbc
have
been
outstanding
and
this
is
no
expection
o
another
solid
offering
from
mbc
if
the
flavor
profile
had
been
as
intense
as
the
aroma
it
would
have
been
a
real
winner
ok
overall
but
not
the
greatest
especially
with
some
really
nice
pale
ales
being
made
out
there
these
days
overall
really
great
apa
and
mbc
continues
to
impress
me
seek
out
again
for
sure
serving
type
bottle
mo
pours
an
opaque
orange
it
actually
looks
just
like
orange
juice
but
for
the
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
thats
sitting
atop
the
beer
theres
both
solid
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
of
dank
bitter
grapefruit
peel
an
aroma
a
typically
associate
with
centennial
hops
the
flavor
displays
a
brief
bit
of
bready
malts
at
the
open
before
a
very
snappy
bitterness
comes
along
the
close
tastes
of
grapefruit
peel
but
also
the
pith
which
ends
up
giving
the
beer
a
slightly
unpleasant
close
the
body
is
a
tad
chewy
and
the
carbonation
dull
but
both
are
super
close
to
being
right
on
the
money
mo
is
right
at
the
upper
end
of
the
apa
category
trending
towards
an
ipa
and
its
just
an
alright
version
of
the
style
i
definitely
prefer
peeper
from
mbc
overall
a
refreshing
flavorful
and
very
tasty
pale
ale
i
could
drink
this
all
day
another
hit
from
maine
beer
co
who
continues
to
impress
my
biggest
criticism
would
be
that
they
tend
to
be
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
overall
maine
beer
company
is
all
about
fantastic
bottle
conditioned
beers
mo
and
zoe
are
without
a
doubt
my
favorites
honestly
they
are
tied
for
1st
place
lunch
is
pretty
good
too
but
this
apa
definately
beat
out
lunch
as
the
better
beer
in
my
opinion
i
wish
that
maine
beer
company
was
available
to
me
as
a
local
beer
o
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
had
remarkably
tropical
with
great
balancing
hops
this
beer
is
sessionable
and
full
of
flavor
its
not
lunch
but
it
is
very
tasty
i
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
this
definitely
shares
some
qualities
with
peeper
and
lunch
but
mo
is
clearly
its
own
beer
its
aggressively
dry
hopped
yet
not
very
bitter
and
actually
pretty
mellow
i
typically
love
this
approach
to
the
style
but
mo
has
a
few
offflavors
regardless
its
still
great
taste
fractional
crystalcaramel
malt
solid
hopping
not
bracing
bitterness
solid
body
but
not
an
in
your
face
kind
of
way
really
good
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
get
old
nice
and
delicate
breadiness
that
is
subtle
allowing
the
hops
to
come
across
minorly
grassy
and
grapefruity
pretty
dry
throughout
another
winner
as
far
as
im
concerned
from
the
maine
brewing
company
o
stands
up
against
all
pas
and
most
ipas
keep
em
comin
maine
beer
company
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
i
kind
of
expected
more
from
this
as
peeper
zoe
and
lunch
are
amazing
beers
this
one
is
a
little
overcarbonated
and
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
to
it
its
a
good
beer
but
a
few
tweaks
away
from
being
a
great
beer
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
racing
skyward
and
a
very
healthy
eggshell
colored
head
and
an
undeniable
wall
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
beautiful
delicate
floralcitrus
combo
and
a
touch
of
biscuit
simple
and
classy
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
bready
but
continues
to
offer
a
brisk
herbal
citrus
medley
lemon
and
toasted
grains
floral
edges
perhaps
a
bit
of
oak
this
is
a
solid
but
light
bodied
brew
with
a
tingly
lively
feel
very
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable

picnic

not
quite
as

was
nice
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
very
nice
beer
tasty
and
solidly
built
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
warm
weathre
refresher
beer
with
outstanding
characteristics
solid
proof
that
a
fine
flavored
beer
does
not
have
to
be
a
flavor
steamroller
nor
does
its
abv
content
have
to
be
a
flashing
neon
sign
mouthfeel
nice
and
light
carbonation
good
this
is
wonderfully
complex
for
such
an
easydrinking
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
scream
about
since
the
hops
take
center
stage
on
this
beer
im
not
exactly
sure
if
this
is
really
a
pale
ale
im
just
wondering
if
this
is
closer
to
an
ipa
no
worries
i
would
have
this
again
taste

similar
to
the
aroma
the
grapefruit
citruys
hops
taste
the

things
over
a

decent

body
is
almost
right
sadly
i
think
all
the
carbonation
disappeared
in
the
head
since
it

out

but
a
really
well
done
straight
up
no

pale
ale
o
im
mad
at
myself
because
i
bout
this
beer
about
a
month
and
a
half
ago
and
stuck
it
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
i
entirely
forgot
what
it
was
and
thought
it
was
a
stout
so
i
just
kinda
kept
letting
it
go
i
wish
i
had
drank
it
sooner
so
that
it
was
even
fresher
that
being
said
it
drinks
quite
nicely
and
has
a
nice
taste
maine
beer
co
has
once
again
come
through
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
far
and
away
better
pale
ale
than
peeper
seek
this
one
out
and
you
wont
be
sorry
overall
another
really
nice
offering
from
maine
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
have
another
very
creamy
taste
hoppy
and
malty
well
balanced
and
worth
every
penny
i
love
mbc
they
have
to
be
one
of
my
fav
brewers
they
are
consistantly
good
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
another
solid
offering
from
mbc
in
western
portland
good
to
see
that
so
many
amazing
brews
are
made
at
5
breweries
in
such
a
small
industrial
area
will
be
looking
forward
to
more
of
this
in
the
future
this
was
a
hoppy
but
not
overly
hoppy
beer
very
pleasant
to
drink
overall
this
has
a
uniqueness
about
it
that
warrants
a
tasting
definitely
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
o
a
great
pale
ale
overall
though
definitely
more
of
an
ipa
still
it
smells
great
and
tastes
good
as
well
o
just
too
dry
for
me
the
malt
bill
seems
emaciated
o
this
is
tasty
hops
could
be
a
little
more
assertive
in
the
taste
but
its
still
refined
smells
awesome
big
hops
citrus
pine
but
mostly
citrus
nice
dry
malt
cracker
flavor
to
back
up
the
bitter
this
beer
is
awesome
might
be
my
new
fav
pale
ale
overall
not
bad
def
not
their
best
beer
so
far
its
more
like
an
amber
than
apa
with
the
amount
of
malty
flavors
in
it
esp
the
reddish
toasty
malts
the
hops
arent
quite
what
i
was
expecting
either
but
all
in
all
a
decent
tasty
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
on
tap
and
see
if
it
changes
like
peeper
did

light
edit
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
just
1
month
old
anod
it
couldnt
have
been
more
bland
and
boring
the
aroma
was
non
existent
and
the
flavor
practically
vanished
at
the
first
hint
of
any
flavor
highly
dissapointing
i
have
to
dock
points
for
inconsistency
too
bad
because
the
first
bottle
was
so
good
i
felt
taken
the
second
time
around
given
the
price
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
overall
mbc
has
another
topnotch
hoppy
beer
with
mo
fills
the
slot
nicely
in
between
peeper
and
lunch
the
nose
carries
some
faint
tropical
fruits
and
a
bit
of
citrus
light
mango
just
a
touch
of
pale
malt
lingering
in
the
background
for
some
depth
the
flavor
has
the
same
elements
with
a
bit
of
orange
peel
sneaking
in
nice
and
light
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a

through

mo
is

a
nice
two
finger
head
with
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
has
a
very
lovely
hop
aroma
with
some
stellar
citrus
and
pine
the
taste
is
just
sublime
seriously
mbc
knows
what
its
doing
excellent
balance
of
all
components
across
the
board
the
mouthfeel
too
is
slick
as
hell
this
could
easily
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
these
guys
have
going
on
this
may
be
better
than
both
lunch
and
zoe
to
me
incredible
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
the
amount
of
hops
and
6
abv
this
is
borderline
ipa
territory
i
suppose
its
whatever
the
brewer
calls
it
but
if
i
had
it
blind
id
call
it
an
ipa
either
way
its
a
great
example
of
a
clean
hoppy
beer
that
could
be
a
mess
if
it
wasnt
done
properly
o
decent
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
extra
points
for
local
and
1
for
the
planet
very
good
beer
and
maybe
the
best
ive
had
from
maine
so
far
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
overall
this
was
a
great
apa
i
have
been
impressed
2
out
of
2
times
with
this
brewery
their
hoppy
stuff
is
legit
very
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
this
is
right
up
there
with
th
apas
for
me
taste
is
sweet
pale
malts
to
start
citrus
in
the
middle
with
ample
pine
through
the
close
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
price
is
somewhat
prohibitive
for
an
apa
but
if
i
dont
think
about
when
im
drinking
its
so
good
that
its
all
worth
it
o
i
dont
know
how
maine
beer
keeps
doing
it
but
they
do
this
is
a
borderline
ipa
but
focused
better
on
balance
and
drinkability
flavors
compliment
each
other
wonderfully
and
makes
this
another
great
addition
to
their
lineup
this
one
falls
somewhere
between
lunch
and
peeper
and
fits
in
perfectly
o
definitely
recommend
this
one
too
good
to
pass
up
for
the
price
ive
had
apas
twice
the
price
that
were
a
quarter
as
good
definitely
a
score
for
mbc
well
done
maine
beer
co
overall
a
really
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
with
some
great
citrus
hop
notes
the
hops
are
really
delicate
and
offer
some
great
flavors
and
aromas
another
great
beer
from
maine
beer
it
seems
everything
they
is
quality
and
top
notch
for
the
style
even
if
its
just
a
pale
ale
o
another
fantastic
offering
from
maine
beer
company
definitely
up
their
with
my
favorites
by
them
oa
solid
pale
ale
that
compliments
their
line
nicely
o
this
is
the
third
beer
ive
had
from
maine
beer
co
and
its
my
favorite
so
far
definitely
seems
like
itd
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
nicer
warmer
weather
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
one
id
pick
up
again
great
brew
all
around
zoe
is
still
the
class
of
this
brewery
with
a
similar
hop
profile
plus
a
wicked
spicy
bite
that
makes
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
mo
is
a
solid
pale
to
be
reckoned
with
however
id
love
to
see
this
sucker
in
cans
some
day
nose
is
phenomenal
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
i
remember
it
being
a
pale
ale
i
could
drink
until
the
end
of
my
days
one
of
the
top
23
best
smelling
beers
i
have
come
across
serving
type
bottle
update
70513
had
this
a
few
times
since
theyve
really
dialed
this
one
in
hop
flavor
to
bitterness
ratio
has
improved
taste
score
upped
overall
i
love
this
aggressively
dryhopped
apa
thing
maine
beer
co
kills
it
great
balance
and
one
hell
of
a
nose
if
they
keep
this
kind
of
stuff
up
itll
disappear
faster
than
lunch
and
thats
saying
something
o
this
is
a
delicious
pale
ale
kinda
seems
like
an
ipa
to
me
but
whatever
you
want
to
call
this
it
is
delicious
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
a
seriously
hoppy
pale
ale
o
overall
this
beer
is
well
oh
my
god
is
it
good
great
tropical
aspects
that
just
scream
fresh
really
worth
picking
up
if
one
has
the
chance
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
but
i
expect
a
lot
more
from
mbc
a
pretty
underwhelming
offering
when
compared
to
the
quality
of
peeper
zoe
and
lunch
slight
fruitiness
initially
dry
bitterness
takes
over
quickly
and
is
particularly
tingly
on
the
tongue
exceptionally
long
bitter
aftertaste
the
body
leans
on
the
richer
side
while
the
carbonation
is
as
expected
i
am
just
blown
away
by
how
good
this
brewery
makes
beer
just
another
solid
offering
regardless
of
mouthfeel
real
good
stuff
here
mbc
is
really
hitting
home
runs
with
their
hop
forward
beers
i
need
six
packs
very
delicious
drink
fresh
overall
this
is
great
stuff
especially
for
mainenew
england
where
everything
is
heavy
on
the
malt
pick
up
a
bottle
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
quite
hoppy
this
beer
flirts
with
ipa
status
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
zombie
dust
excellent
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
buy
a
case
before
it
sells
out
a
must
have
5
0
always
excited
to
try
anything
new
from
the
guys
at
mbc
this
one
pours
a
very
vibrant
gold
very
clear
huge
rocky
head
lively
and
screaming
fresh
very
hoppy
in
the
nose
lots
of
green
pine
some
citrus
herby
flavor
is
indeed
very
hoppy
but
this
beer
remains
balanced
lots
of
bright
hops
herbal
and
grassy
and
pine
again
woodsy
light
doughy
malts
and
a
definite
crispness
this
beer
is
super
light
on
the
palate
for
having
so
much
flavor
very
airy
and
quaffable
definitely
along
the
same
lines
as
peeper
and
lunch
but
a
testament
the
brewery
that
they
can
pull
off
such
a
variety
of
hoppy
light
colored
beers
that
all
have
their
own
identity
curious
to
see
if
this
makes
it
into
the
regular
rotation
or
is
just
a
seasonal
oneoff
always
a
delicious
fresh
well
made
beer
from
maine
i
like
this
beer
although
similar
it
is
distinctly
different
than
peeper
this
is
hoppier
than
a
lot
of
pale
ales
its
close
to
an
ipa
fans
of
mbc
wont
be
disappointed
with
this
new
product
if
youve
enjoyed
their
other
offerings
i
recommend
you
give
mo
a
shot
as
well
o
the
extreme
care
and
hard
work
shown
by
the
brewery
is
evident
yet
again
in
this
newest
beer
not
sure
if
this
is
a
onetime
deal
or
if
they
will
release
more
though
this
is
a
lot
like
peeper
only
a
little
maltier
in
the
taste
very
easy
to
drink
and
evenly
priced
with
the
rest
of
the
lineup
this
reminds
me
of
a
session
ipa
very
little
malt
character
which
is
different
from
most
pale
ales
this
is
a
pineyhoppy
and
slight
tropical
fruit
pale
ale
a
finger
and
a
half
worth
of
of
pale
light
khaki
colored
crisp
slightly
airy
forth
that
displays
decent
retention
once
receded
there
is
a
full
thick
veil
of
lacing
and
a
surprisingly
thick
collar
this
one
is
110
translucent
the
color
is
a
medium
gold
with
vibrant
orange
undertones
a
moderate
bit
of
varying
paced
carbonation
rises
randomly
throughout
a
good
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
session
proceeds
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
slightly
dank
its
a
strong
all
malt
aroma
dominated
by
bread
crust
and
graham
crackers
perhaps
some
very
faint
hints
of
toffee
and
orange
zest
as
well
the
aroma
was
a
good
indicator
of
flavor
in
addition
to
the
strong
malt
base
that
was
expected
there
is
also
a
distinctive
hoppiness
and
a
slight
metallic
presence
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
dense
and
sits
heavy
on
the
tongue
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
a
text
book
american
pale
ale
nothing
off
putting
but
nothing
overly
memorable
either
just
a
rock
solid
offering
which
should
come
as
no
surprise
from
lagunitas
pours
a
light
orange
dark
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
was
really
nice
with
scents
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
as
well
as
some
pine
the
taste
was
good
as
well
mixing
the
hops
up
front
with
a
nice
amount
of
malt
to
mellow
out
into
a
very
clean
finish
very
happy
with
this
one
bottle
poured
into
a
wine
glass
citrus
biscuit
hop

and
flavors
good
carbonation
have
not
had
this
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
one
month
old
bottle
laggy
does
not
make
a
bad
brew
imo
but
this
one
is
just
ok
very
easy
drinking
for
what
its
worth
light

average

and
a
little

wouldnt
drink
again
unless
options
limited
very
average
you
cant
go
wrong
with
new
dogtown
pale

not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
vs
the
ipa
which
is
roughly
the
same
abv
and
ibus
hop
stoopid
lite
some
people
have
said
i
could
get
down
with
that
its
also
soft
and
way
drinkable
the
only
way
in
fact
that
it
actually
resembles
an
apa
might
take
this
over
the
ipa
which
could
be
the
point

thin

like

with
a
heavy

and
dry

but
being
a
pale

and
not
a

i
think
it

tropical

floral
the
taste
has
that

quality

a
little
woody

added

a

the

isnt

of
an

that
or
ive
drank
too
many

tonight
before
trying
this
i
dig
it
with
lagunitas
it
seems
you
cant
go
wrong
with
any
of
their
offerings
curious
to
see
how
the
bros
to
rate
it
above
average

double

nice
tastes

super
tropical

nice

bitter
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
to
drink
with
tons
of
flavor
but
still
easy
drinking
for
the
pale

style
of
the

well
done

solid

that
i
would
revisit
but
this
is
on
the
lower
end
of
lagunitas
ipa
offerings
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
and
i
was
really
impressed
by
its
look
the
taste
was
surprisingly
complex
and
it
held
its
own
all
the
way
to
the
end
a
solid
effort
from
lagunitas
taste
nice
hop
taste
yet
balanced
enough
not
to
let
it
get
to

overall
pretty
nice

almost
gives

my
fourth

review
lagunitas
really
nails
the
ipapa

types
great

strong

maybe
some

i
loved
the

very
strong
you
can
tell
whats
coming
a
mile
away
the
color
is
an

very
enticing
give
it
a
shot
if
you
have
a
chance
you
just
cant
go
wrong
with
lagunitas
when
it
comes
to
nailing
a
style
good
apa
has
that
signature
lagunitas
backbone
with
all
the
typical
hoppiness
toned
down
a
few
notches
hits
the
category
well
overall
4
255
one
of
the
best
standard
apas
ive
had
lighter
in
body
than
snpa
but
still
big
on
the
flavor
without
being
too
overthetop
for
the
style
would
highly
recommend
brilliant
clarity
frothy
ivory
head
that
lingers
aroma
is
dominated
by
pine
earthy
and
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
flavor
lacks
a
bit
in
comparison
fairly
bitter
dominant
in
the
finish
malt
is
somewhat
bready
but
those
bittering
hops
kill
the
taste
for
me
citrus
eventually
comes
out
but
the
bitterness
overwhelms
o
good
quality
pale
ale
with
nice
flavors
o
honestly
i
was
expecting
more
here
lagintas
normally
has
very
solid
offerings
but
this
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
im
wondering
if
this
keg
was
a
touch
old
maybe
i
will
revisit
this
one
at
a
later
date
its
an
excellent
american
pale
ale
o
very
good
pale
ale
unlike
many
of
the
other
lagunitas
offering
ive
had
this
one
has
more
of
a
bitter
hop
presence
versus
the
booming
maltiness
im
used
to
from
them
this
one
actually
kicks
more
than
some
garbage
ipas
it
is
somewhat
understated
in
the
sense
of
intensity
sort
of
like
dales
pale
ale
and
could
pretty
much
be
considered
an
ipa
pours

crystal
clear

looks

like
loads
of

type
of

you
can
imagine

taste
is
definitely
big

hops
grapefruitlemon
being
the
primary
if
u
dont
like
hitter
hops
this
is
not
your
beer
carbonation
level
is
fairly
high
but
it
works
with
the
flavors
overall
im
impressed
lagunitas
brews
some
high
quality
pale
ales
if
u
like
hops
this
is
a
good
one
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
but
if
youre
a
big

you
might
like
it
more

i

the
flavor
profile
is
a
complex
blend
of
hop
flavor
that
leaves
the
sweet
biscuit
in
the
background
it
begins
as
a
tropical
blend
with
grapefruit
in
the
forefront
then
flows
into
a

bitterness
as
the
bitterness
subsides
a

evolves
that
highlights
the
orange

component
the

is
tart
with
a
burst

an
outstanding
well

overall
an

for
a
good
bit
damn
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
bright
citrusfloral
hops
and
moderate
pale
malt
sweetness
with
a
nice
maltbitterness
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
smooth
crisp
and
moderately
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
bright
citrusfloral
hops
and
pale
malt
sweetness
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
so
its
not
sessionable
and
not
an
occasion
beer
so
i
dont
see
it
getting
any
space
in
my
fridge
anytime
soon
its
really
a
notch
below
the
sculpin
and
stones
ruination
ipa
imo
its
not
even
in
the
same
universe
as
the
enjoy
by
hohum
lets
assault
our
palate
with
hops
could
be
quite
nice
if
we
actually
had
atleast
a
trace
of
malt
overall
i
know
this
stuff
is
beloved
but
im
kind
of
lukewarm
on
it
its
very
average
the
dominant
flavors
dont
appeal
to
me
which
is
kind
of
a
dealbreaker
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
modest
amount
of
malt
supporting
a
pretty
hop
forward
flavor
with
slight
spice
and
pine
and
gentle
tangy
zesty
citrus
which
makes
for
a
mostly
balanced
taste
in
general
with
some
mild
sweetness
as
it
finishes
there
is
a
mild
alcohol
note
in
the
taste
which
adds
to
the
slight
bite
of
bitter
hops
which
are
almost
grapefruitlike
overall
i
think
this
is
decent
for
what
it
is
a
stronger
west
coast
style
pale
practically
an
ipa
but
a
nice
malt
balance
explains
the
pale
label
imo
overall
drinkability
a
very
hoppy
beer
but
not
a
bitter
hop
wallop
strong
emphasis
on
aroma
hops
with
this
one
with
a
simple
hop
flavor
profile
well
crafted
and
well
done
interestingly
though
due
to
the
dryness
and
weaker
malt
backbone
i
find
one
is
enough
its
strong
flavor
wears
out
my
palate
such
that
i
dont
want
another
one
right
away
another
one
later
on
but
not
one
right
now
overall
this
is
a
very
good
apa
one
of
my
favorites
overall
goddamn
wonderful
one
of
if
not
the
best
pa
on
the
market
o
worth
a
try
not
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
but
drinkable
and
tasty
taste
starts
with
grapefruit
and
orange
rind
then
stale
bread
and
caramel
malts
with
a
light
bready
rindy
floral
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
heavier
than
average
with
a
bit
above
average
carbonation
a
bit
grainy
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
12914
o
i
hope
to
be
able
to
find
this
stuff
again
it
could
develop
into
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
smooth
and
crisp
yet
packs
plenty
of
flavor
both
hoppy
and
malty
quite
complex
for
a
pale
ale
highly
recommended
as
a
fan
of
lagunitas
s
ipas
i
was
quite
excited
to
try
their
apa
it
did
not
dissappoint
this
ale
pours
a
hazy
yellow
copper
color
with
a
generous
and
lasting
white
frothy
head
it
sips
very
clean
and
light
given
the
abv
and
the
style
of
beer
the
aromas
are
citrusy
and
hoppy
at
first
giving
way
to
a
malty
sweetness
flavors
follow
suit
with
a
beginning
of
pine
and
citrus
as
a
result
of
the
hops
giving
way
to
a
sweet
malt
and
yest
note
and
resolving
back
to
the
bitterness
of
hops
on
the
finish
im
even
getting
some
notes
of
coffee
surprising
for
an
ale
of
this
lightness
as
with
all
the
lagunitas
products
this
is
a
quality
crafted
beer
and
one
that
i
could
enjoy
frequently
and
in
ample
amounts
overall
a
stellar
american
pale
ale
from
lagunitas
nice
level
of
bitterness
complemented
by
the
bready
malts
make
this
a
true
example
of
the
style
a
decent
pale
ale
would
like
more
hoppiness
and
less
grainy
flavors
o
this
is
a
real
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
respectable
drinkability
tons
of
floral
piney
aftertaste
that
i
enjoy
makes
me
want
another
one
maybe
i
will
o
i
had
another
one
of
these
beers
later
that
night
and
it
definitely
grew
on
me
definitely
a
pale
ale
i
would
gladly
recommend
and
drink
again
long
live
lagunitas
final
thoughts
a
decent
apa
but
not
something
id
seek
out
a
little
average
where
that
category
is
concerned
but
supplies
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
things
interesting
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
ontap
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
just
a
bit
beyond
sessionable
definitely
is
an
ipa
and
not
a
pale
ale
definitely
try
it
if
you
have
the
opportunity
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
o
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
had
so
far
i
love
bold
beer
this
fits
the
bill
nice
pale
ale
great
session
brew
pours
a
touch
hazy
medium
gold
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
to
light
foamy
nebulous
and
marginal
lace
aroma
is
bready
crackery
malt
with
lots
of
grapefruit
to
counter
and
a
hint
of
mineral
water
the
flavor
is
pretty
straight
forward
light
hints
of
sugary
sweetness
and
oyster
crackers
with
plenty
of
citrusy
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
pine
to
skew
this
one
towards
that
hoppy
side
of
the
road
firm
hop
bitterness
keeps
the
palette
awake
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
resinous
mouthfeel
very
nice
pale
ale
nothing
horribly
complex
but
with
an
old
school
feel
and
drinkability
i
could
get
into
a
few
of
these
the
lagunitas
new
dogtown
pale
ale
really
impressed
me
i
dont
usually
pick
a
pale
ale
as
i
would
prefer
an
ipa
but
i
found
the
dogtown
pale
ale
a
creamy
and
smooth
pale
ale
that
i
drank
easily
it
had
an
amber
pour
with
a
creamy
head
and
good
hop
aroma
it
had
that
signature
lagunitas
hop
flavor
with
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
to
keep
it
balanced
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
lagunitas
and
one
i
would
definitely
keep
on
hand
o
fantastic
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
these
no
problem
ill
come
back
again
overall
really
nice
beer
packs
quite
a
punch
and
has
a
hop
bite
mixed
with
some
nice
malts
to
make
a
balanced
beer
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
worth
trying
for
sure
a
really
tasty
pale
ale
nothing
particularly
unique
but
the
clean
crisp
flavors
are
very
well
done
bright
hop
notes
upfront
are
well
balanced
with
the
malt
pours
light
apricot
with
a
1
finger
foamy
white
head
lagunitas
never
disappoints
in
the
appearance
department
very
tropical
aroma
pineapple
and
mango
being
the
biggest
notes
hints
of
bready
malt
is
there
but
very
light
the
tropical
notes
continue
in
the
taste
i
cant
remember
a
pale
ale
this
tropical
more
of
a
malt
backbone
in
the
taste
then
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
medium
bodied
but
still
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
parts
of
this
beer
is
the
dirt
cheap
price
not
dirt
cheap
but
you
cant
beat
8
99
a
sixer
of
craft
beer
if
this
ever
moves
to
the
cincy
area
i
would
have
it
in
my
fridge
everyday
overall
this
is
a
real
nice
drinkable
well
balanced
brew
by
lagunitas
pretty
hoppy
but
balanced
well
to
make
it
very
drinkable
almost
sessionable
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
few
of
if
i
ever
see
this
on
tap
id
totally
get
it
again
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
much
prefer
peeper
as
an
apa
but
this
isnt
a
bad
deal
for
the
price
around
9
50
for
a
sixer
it
smells
great
i
just
wish
its
flavor
matched
its
nose
a
bit
more
o
not
as
bold
as
many
pale
ales
but
sometimes
thats
a
good
thing
as
components
besides
the
hops
get
to
shine
overall
very
good
apa
highly
drinkable
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
good
bitterness
that
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
slick
resin
rather
than
the
dryness
associated
with
high
hopped
beers
o
well
im
not
a
fan
of
ipas
or
any
beer
with
overt
amount
of
hops
which
is
most
of
lagunitas
stuff
i
bought
it
cause
it
was
cheap
but
well
i
shouldnt
have
since
i
dont
like
these
kinds
of
beers
none
the
less
for
hop
lovers
this
would
be
a
beer
you
would
like
to
try
a
tasty
pale
ale
poured
from
bottle
into
new
belgium
tulip
golden
slightly
orange
color
with
thick
2
finger
foamy
head
grainy
piney
hop
aroma
taste
is
crisp
piney
hop
nice
malt
balance
and
an
almost
fruity
hop
finish
its
light
and
balanced
but
aggressively
hopped
really
nice
apa
actually
always
underestimated
this
one
but
its
a
great
brew
i
will
likely
get
again
a
good
apa
the
hop
presence
resembles
an
ipa
and
adds
some
nice
citrus
grapefruit
and
pine
flavors
the
malt
is
picked
up
in
the
nose
but
is
less
dominant
in
the
taste
although
it
gives
it
a
bready
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
with
the
thickness
and
carbonation
but
is
somewhat
oily
overall
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
going
down
easy
and
with
enough
hop
flavor
to
make
the
beer
enjoyable
for
an
ipa
fan
but
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
complexity
still
its
worth
trying
o
tone
down
the
graininess
and
you
have
a
serious
contender
for
best
pale
ale
i
am
impressed
by
this
offering
while
its
not
to
the
level
of
sucks
or
lil
sumpin
sumpin
its
a
very
good
very
balanced
take
on
the
style
othis
is
a
pretty
tasty
hopforward
apa
the
smell
is
particularly
inviting
with
a
nice
balance
of
mildly
sweet
citrus
flavors
and
sharper
drier
notes
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
harsh
and
rough
around
the
edges
but
not
terrible
by
any
means
this
is
a
solid
easy
to
drink
brew
for
everyday
drinking
o
outstanding
pale
ale
lagunitas
is
flat
out
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
and
this
apa
is
exactly
what
youd
want
in
a
pale
lighter
on
the
body
refreshing
crisp
and
bright
i
could
down
a
ton
of
these
so
delicious
second
best
pale
ale
ever
made
ridiculously
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
and
i
love
that
close
to
lagunitas
ipa
without
any
hint
of
bitterness
so
glad
fresno
started
carrying
this
gem
more
expensive
than
the
ipa
here
but
worth
every
penny
very
refreshing
12oz
brown
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
mostly
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
left
streaks
on
the
glass
the
beer
is
full
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
aroma
and
flavors
with
citrus
rind
bitterness
on
the
after
taste
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
a
few
very
good
overall
overall
its
a
damn
fine
quality
beer
not
that
i
would
expect
anything
less
from
lagunitas
overall
solid
pale
ale
which
ive
had
before
and
will
be
another
go
to
beer
for
me
definitely
worth
a
try
a
hops
forward
apa
that
pours
cloudy
amber
with
decent
foam
aroma
is
pineapple
grapefruit
subdued
pale
malt
woodsy
hops
taste
is
citrus
grapefruit
orange
wellrounded
sweetness
with
little
overt
carameltoffee
some
herbal
nettle
or
rosemary
notes
perhaps
a
hint
of
gooseberry
or
current
as
things
progress
crisp
and
refreshing
some
subtle
white
pepper
heatspice
kind
of
an
archetypal
apa
on
the
hoppy
end
of
the
apa
spectrum
not
earthshattering
but
certainly
not
bad
either
would
drink
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
hot
summer
afternoon
if
not
in
the
mood
for
a
more
classic
sessional
i
continue
to
really
enjoy
everything
lagunitas
does
particularly
the
less
subtle
stuff
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
im
not
sure
if
this
really
reflects
the
recent
wave
of
west
coast
apas
but
it
has
some
nice
hoppy
notes
its
not
the
best
of
its
style
or
the
best
thing
from
lagunitas
but
i
might
be
getting
this
again
o
overall
a
simple
but
wellmade
pale
ale
if
you
like
them
hoppy
then
you
should
try
the
new
dogtown
o
this
pale
ale
reminds
me
of
snpa
citsidyhopforward
for
a
pale
very
good
overall
o
found
it
in
chiangmai
loving
it
for
its
scent
taste
and
american
flavour
rare
find
in
these
parts
takes
me
back
to
travels
in
the
us
would
pair
well
with
spicy
food
but
is
great
by
itself
o
ill
have
to
get
more
of
this
to
try
fully
carbonated
because
it
was
so
good
another
winner
from
luganitas
grade
b
overall
this
is
one
of
the
few
american
pale
ales
i
like
make
that
love
another
winner
from
lagunitas
which
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
they
do
hops
right
although
this
brew
is
not
listed
as
sessionable
i
believe
it
is
the
most
sessionable
a
p
a
i
have
had
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
for
the
summer
or
really
anytime
super
session
beer
that
also
carries
a
pretty
high
abv
this
is
a
great
burger
beer
that
would
be
awesome
to
bring
to
any
bbq
or
to
have
on
draft
with
some
wings
and
fries
o
a
good
pale
ale
but
left
me
wanting
more
im
a
big
fan
of
lagunitas
and
this
is
another
solid
beer
i
have
been
leaning
towards
hoppy
pales
over
ipas
lately
because
of
the
finess
you
get
in
the
flavor
i
just
recently
got
to
try
zd
for
the
first
time
and
had
high
hopes
but
alas
it
was
all
bitter
an
little
flavor
this
is
just
the
opposite
all
hop
flavor
no
bitterness
i
hope
i
can
keep
getting
this
around
here
fresh
perfect
summer
and
almost
perfect
pale
pours
splendid
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
tall
head
of
foam
that
fell
ever
so
slowly
to
some
sticky
craggy
lacing
classic
copper
orange
color
and
clear
nose
was
dry
and
the
perfect
blend
of
leafy
hops
and
pale
malt
a
little
grapefruit
and
a
little
soap
the
malt
in
the
nose
gives
a
promise
of
sweetness
thats
luscious
and
provocative
taste
is
herbal
generous
with
hops
hay
and
silky
with
citrus
that
wasnt
overbearing
the
malt
backbone
was
aggressive
and
evoked
some
honey
sweetness
while
standing
up
strong
against
the
bitter
hop
oily
resin
this
was
a
full
bodied
and
boisterous
pale
ale
that
was
clean
thirst
quenching
and
had
a
depth
of
flavor
that
was
solid
and
satisfying
excellent
hoppy
pale
ale
certainly
not
as
hoppy
or
heavy
as
an
ipa
but
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
im
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
or
that
i
dont
enjoy
more
often
o
awesome
pale
ale
from
lagunitas
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
o
more
like
a
straight
up
ipa
but
whos
keeping
score
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
o
nice
drinking
pale
ale
rjt
o
a
fine
american
pale
ale
but
im
not
sure
it
stands
out
from
the
other
american
pale
ales
ive
had
the
color
that
bleeds
just
every
so
slightly
toward
peach
is
unique
and
the
orange
smell
is
cool
very
similar
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
which
aint
a
bad
thing
at
all
the
brew
pours
a
clear
ambergold
and
is
capped
by
a
modestly
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
pale
malt
aromas
and
a
touch
of
caramel
and
honey
add
a
sweetness
to
the
citrus
and
floral
notes
that
dominate
the
nose
slightly
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
provide
the
sweet
flavors
that
balance
the
leafy
and
citrus
hop
flavors
very
well
balanced
new
dogtown
is
medium
bodied
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
would
definitely
have
it
again
very
nice
golden
color
nice
head
that
fades
quickly
lacing
on
the
glass
strong
smell
of
grapefruit
citrus
and
pine
on
the
front
end
fades
to
a
gentle
sweet
malt
back
nice
mouthfeel
with
good
bitterness
and
carbonation
that
both
linger
overall
a
really
nice
pale
ale
perfect
on
a
warm
afternoon
overall
this
is
an
incredible
and
fantastic
beer
it
has
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
slightly
more
than
the

west

pale

medium
strenghted
body
and
feel
to
the
brew
a
little
on
the
fizzy
side
but
pleasant
enough
and
easy
to
drink
passing
alcatraz
as
i
drank
the
beer
made
it
even
better
m
smooth
and
quaffable
o
lost
in
sucksamania
is
this
rocksolid
pale
ale
yes
it
tastes
like
many
other
hoppy
offerings
from
lagunitas
but
when
theyre
all
really
goodtofantastic
who
cares
a
great
lunch
beer
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
other
lagunitas
beers
ive
had
bold
hop
character
all
the
way
through
i
dont
detect
much
malt
balance
in
this
pale
ale
with
all
the
ipas
these
guys
produce
i
guess
i
was
expecting
an
even
balanced
and
more
hops
subdued
and
malty
pale
ale
either
way
gotta
love
lagunitas
gonna
try
their

next

this
definitely
falls
under
the
extreme
category
if
you
like
sucking
hop
pellets
youll
like
this
beer
o
overall
it
was
pretty
damn
good
although
it
tried
to
be
a
maximus
however
it
failed
a
damn
fine
pale
one
of
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
and
a
definite
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
any
time
it
was
so
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
that
i
had
2
so
fast
that
i
had
to
slow
down
a
very
high
recommendation
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
overall
first
time
having
this
beer
and
am
impressed
lagunitas
makes
some
good
hoppy
beers
would
love
to
try
another
one
fresher

overall
this

comes

with
great
balance
and
passes
with
flying
colors
unique
maybe
my
favorite
yearround
pale
ale
on
the
market
today
b
o
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
a
new
craft
beer
drinker
and
show
how
a
basic
beer
can
be
very
enjoyable

to

i
think
i
cant

smell
because
there
is
smoking
allowed
in
this
bar
will
have
to
revisit
taste
is
similar
to
other
lagunitas
offerings
but
less
flowerycreamy
than
sumpin
ale
and
obviously
less
bitter
than
the
ipa
still
its
sweet
and
malty
and
very
good
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
biting
but
also
not
terribly
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
overall
new
dogtown
pale
ale
is
very
nice
really
enjoy
the
brewery
and
this
fits
nicely
with
other
offerings
cheers
this
is
another
great
lagunitas
beer
very
hopy
and
tasty
o
a
good
pale
but
not
great
its
really
threading
the
line
with
an
ipa
but
not
quite
there
id
rather
go
with
the
ipa
o
just
malty
enough
to
keep
this
from
being
an
ipa
a
damn
good
pa
thats
enjoyable
to
drink
glad
i
bought
a
6pack
the
epitome
of
the
style

a

between
some

with
some

and

notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
good
but
not
as
hopcentric
as
i
was
expecting
knowing
the
brewer
other
offerings
serving
type
bottle
oa
nice
solid
flavorful
pale
ale
and
a
good
value
revisited
in
june
2013
with
a
most
likely
2013
bottle
o
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
as
this
drinks
like
a
4
beer
than
the
6
2
that
it
is
very
nice
aromas
and
flavors
of
grapefruitcitrus
hops
o
an
aggressive
beast
of
an
apa
this
one
delivers
on
both
the
malts
and
hops
maintaining
a
very
flavorful
balance
throughout
not
very
bitter
but
it
shouldnt
be
with
this
amount
of
flavors
absolutely
worth
trying
o
pale
hoppytouch
pretty
balanced
huge
fan
of
lagunitas
here
and
this
left
me
a
little
underwhelmed
that
said
this
is
a
well
hopped
pale
and
supremely
drinkable
just
not
my
favorite
o
overall
worth
a
try
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
but
i
might
drink
it
again
if
i
see
it
a
very
hop
dominated
american
pale
ale
id
like
to
throw
in
an
indian
as
well
o
a
very
refreshing
american
pale
ale
with
a
fantastic
smell
and
awesome
aroma
o
really
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
the
style
i
feel
like
there
is
some
bias
since
i
am
an
ipa
fan
really
great
ill
look
for
this
again
this
pours
a
light
goldenamber
color
with
a
ruddy
orange
hue
there
is
some
light
foaming
and
an
upfront
assertive
grassy
hop
aroma
the
flavor
comes
across
as
green
grassy
and
hoppyjust
what
id
expectwith
a
piney
bite
and
a
dry
finish
nicely
bodied
tasty
and
smooth
hoppy
pale
ales
yum
very
easy
drinker
so
nicely
balanced
of
a
drink
this
one
may
have
had
a
bit
of
age
but
still
was
nice
medium
bodied
but
fuller
than
expected
with
a
great
balance
of
dry
bitterness
citrustropical
fruit
and
pale
malt
dry
and
bitter
up
front
with
some
grassy
pine
flavor
countered
by
orange
rind
grapefruit
and
mango
subtle
malt
backbone
but
just
enough
to
balance
things
out
easy
drinking
and
very
flavorful
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
o
i
really
really
love
this
beer
its
pretty
bitter
up
front
so
i
think
hopheads
will
appreciate
it
but
its
also
nice
and
balanced
for
beer
drinkers
like
me
who
prefer
a
nutty
malty
ales
highly
recommend
this
one
o
this
is
an
excellent
vision
of
a
very
hoppy
apa
just
enough
malt
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
bitter
a
fine
session
ale
that
will
never
get
boring
this
is
a
very
flavorful
apa
its
bready
malty
and
full
of
hops
the
citrusy
floral
hop
character
lends
great
balance
and
drinkability
to
this
pale
ale
ill
definitely
have
this
again
well
done
lagunitas
clear
goldenorange
with
a
slim
frothy
looking
white
head
fairly
light
but
lovely
fresh
hoppy
aroma
sweet

and
citrus
tasty
oily
floral
and
orange
rind
flavor
solidly
bitter
with
some
sweet
grain
and
subtle
biscuit
to
back
up
the
hops
medium
bodied
pretty
crisp
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
satisfying
overall
definitely
a
very
flavorful
and
bright
pale
ale
i
like
this
because
the
citrus
stands
out
more
than
the
other
flavors
and
the
finish
is
very
crisp
and
dry
6
2
abv
makes
this
nearly
sessionable
a
great
apa
to
knock
back
on
a
hot
summer
night
like
i
am
right
now
another
excellent
lagunitas
offering
o
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
out
there
highly
recommended
surprisingly
good
great
balance
perfect
bitterness
very
good
on
the
patio
during
an
arizona
spring
day
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
unknown
bottled
date
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
foamy
off
white
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
pine
hops
and
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
mouth
coating
hop
resin
the
taste
is
pretty
good
closer
to
an
ipa
which
i
really
liked
nice
amount
of
bitterness
good
earthy
flavor
with
a
nice
caramel
backbone
life
is
uncertain
dont
sip
did
i
mention
the
nice
head
its
another
great
lagunitas
product
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
and
again
overall
a
simple
pale
ale
that
ends
up
being
as
balanced
as
i
would
prefer
them
not
too
malty
and
only
slightly
hoppier
than
usual
a
solid
product
it
seems
like
they
can
only
make
ipas
over
at
lagunitas
but
i
cant
complain
o
enjoyable
for
sure
would
probably
choose
lil
sumpin
sumpin
over
this
9
times
outta
10
however
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
combines
the
drinkability
of
a
pale
ale
with
the
scorching
hop
bitterness
of
an
ipa
another
nice
lagunitas
offering
pours
a
clear

with

slowly
settles
leaving
a

bottled
10
days
ago
this
might
be
a
new
goto
once
their
east
coast
distribution
picks
back
up
an
ipa
but
different
from
lagunitas
ipa
both
are
quite
good
this
brew
pours
a
nice
full
bodied
golden
color
the
head
has
been
sticking
around
for
a
good
amount
of
time
it
is
a
creamy
off
white
the
smell
is
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
but
i
am
likeing
it
a
bunch
there
is
the
slight
malt
with
a
strong
hop
overtone
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
some
pale
ales
but
it
has
something
different
that
i
really
enjoy
it
is
like
the
little
brother
to
the
lagunitas
imperial
red
ale
there
is
a
sense
of
grapefruit
tingles
the
tounge
there
is
freshness
that
reminds
me
of
the
smell
givin
off
from
a
fresh
tomato
plant
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
with
some
thickness
as
it
moves
through
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
take
on
the
style
and
will
go
back
to
this
one
plenty
of
times
opretty
good
beer
very
straightforward
i
could
enjoy
this
any
time
nothing
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
though
o
good
beer
its
not
great
but
i
suggest
trying
it
atleast
once
it
has
a
high
abv
for
a
apa
6
2
its
very
drinkable
and
has
nice
flavors
in
there
id
say
its
just
about
average
as
far
as
apas
go
verdict
a
decent
pale
ale
its
definitely
not
lagunitas
best
effort
but
still
a
solid
brew
i
do
have
some
high
expectations
when
it
comes
to
their
hoppy
beers
with
the
successes
of
lagunitas
sucks
maximus
and
hop
stoopid
and
this
does
fall
a
bit
short
but
a
great
beer
for
someone
getting
into
craft
o
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
the
nose
but
all
in
all
its
still
tasty
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
again
o
one
great
apa
glad
it
is
back
and
better
than
ever
o
i
will
never
apologize
for
being
a
beer
geek
i
love
trying
out
new
beers
every
week
and
either
liking
loving
or
severely
disliking
them
this
is
a
beer
i
like
its
packaged
with
good
looks
enough
smells
to
keep
your
interest
a
taste
that
fools
you
a
little
but
works
itself
out
in
the
end
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
suck
and
gives
the
drinker
an
overall
feeling
of
satisfaction
first
for
having
made
a
smart
purchase
and
second
for
having
enjoyed
a
pretty
good
beer
how
was
that
for
a
runon
sentence
sorry
ms
littman
i
promise
to
do
better
next
time
overall
b
if
you
around
it
get
dis
o
i
am
a
big
lill
sumpin
sumpin
fan
and
i
was
scared
to
try
this
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
lagunitas
taproom
and
really
enjoyed
it
and
later
bought
a
six
pack
its
a
very
solid
pale
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
like
lagunitas
on
tap
a
lot
better
than
in
bottles
after
trying
this
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
i
guess
i
was
secretly
hoping
for
something
a
bit
better
since
its
lagunitas
but
id
have
it
again
o
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
before
and
enjoyed
it
as
a
refreshing
flavorful
but
still
light
brew
sitting
down
to
review
i
found
myself
longing
for
a
more
hop
forward
approach
wished
it
followed
the
nose
a
bit
more
and
a
little
more
substance
in
the
body
but
then
isnt
that
asking
a
little
too
much
of
the
style
this
is
not
an
ipa
although
the
nose
teases
you
into
thinking
it
may
be
so
overall
a
good
pale
imo
poured
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
less
than
one
fingers
worth
of
head
that
quickly
dissipated
a
strong
aroma
of
citrus
and
hints
of
banana
this
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
with
a
refreshing
hop
character
the
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
despite
the
lack
of
head
retention
overall
the
his
a
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
color
is
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
is
quite
persistent
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
too
i
have
to
give
it
an
extra
half
point
for
appearance
since
i
loled
at
the
label
citrus
hop
scents
are
nice
but
a
bit
faded
and
weak
hops
are
a
bit
subdued
in
the
flavor
as
well
there
is
a
floral
bitterness
that
provides
a
slight
balance
to
the
malts
typical
mouthfeel
not
bad
overall
word
to
the
wise
if
youre
out
of
californiatap
range
make
sure
you
try
a
fresh
bottle
this
style
and
this
brew
especially
go
downhill
quickly
should
you
not
obtain
the
freshest
possible
overall
i
am
kind
of
disappointed
that
i
cant
find
this
locally
since
i
needed
to
order
this
from
halftime
beverage
com
but
at
least
i
can
find
the
ipa
not
bad
big
flavor
o
very
good
pale
ale
new
dogtown
pale
ale
looks
like
a
pale
a
light
golden
color
mixed
in
with
some
faint
yellow
and
orange
a
nice
amount
of
foam
on
top
that
left
some
stains
smell
is
fairly
simple
and
light
faint
aroma
hops
with
earth
and
a
mild
backing
in
malt
profile
a
nice
array
of
light
citrus
hits
the
nostrils
with
light
grapefruit
papaya
etc
taste
is
a
laid
back
pale
ale
pale
malt
with
a
earthy
taste
and
light
citrus
with
grapefruit
mango
etc
slight
pine
just
light
tropics
and
light
malt
thats
the
name
of
the
game
when
it
comes
to
the
pales
feel
is
light
smooth
with
a
mild
bittering
that
leaves
instantly
comes
and
goes
leaving
dogtown
to
be
easy
drinking
without
killing
ye
old
palate
i
could
drink
this
all
day
given
the
chance
o
a
good
drinking
beer
that
i
can
drink
one
after
another
nothing
special
just
plain
good
o
lagunitas
does
it
again
with
this
fantastic
pale
ale
id
like
to
complement
it
with
an
orange
wedge
and
see
how
it
does
i
hope
i
get
to
try
this
again
overall
this
is
a
delicious
pale
ale
on
the
verge
of
being
an
ipa
very
refreshing
overall
a
great
choice
highly
recommended
o
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
cheers
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
taste
except
for
the
extreme
hops
o
good
but
misses
the
boat
on
the
balance
that
i
treasure
in
an
apa
i
e
sierra
nevada
victory
headwaters
id
have
it
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
o
dont
consider
this
beer
if
you
are
new
to
beer
drinking
it
is
very
hard
to
drink
and
tastes
horrible
peppery
spicy
but
bright
with
fruit
characters
and
really
nicely
balanced
its
a
pretty
complete
beerits
hard
to
see
how
it
could
be
improved
this
is
the
rare
sort
of
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
by
the
sixpack
overall
good
pales
but
it
is
ipa
strength
ipa
bitterness
its
an
ipa
in
fact
it
is
pretty
much
indistinguishable
from
lagunitas
ipa
solid
beer
but
it
feels
like
they
brewed
it
twice
and
slapped
two
different
labels
on
it
lagunitas
should
drop
either
their
apa
or
ipa
and
use
that
spot
to
release
something
else
regularly
o
i
feel
this
beer
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
its
got
a
lot
more
hops
and
bitterness
than
i
expected
to
it
overall
a
hop
forward
pale
ale
but
not
too
dominating
i
would
prefer
more
malt
backbone
on
this
o
a
solid
pale
ale
with
a
noticeable
malt
backbone
me
likey
a
solid

a

slightly

pale

is
what
i
have
here
not

but
nothing
to
write

about

if
your
desire
for

is
light
thin
bland
flavorless
weak
drain
pour
sometimes
im
surprised
by
beer
and
this
is
one
of
those
times
i
generally
dont
expect
anything
much
from
a
pale
ale
that
is
available
year
round
but
this
beer
impressed
me
i
originally
bought
this
beer
because
it
was
on
sale
and
i
think
firestone
puts
out
some
pretty
good
beers
the
beer
pours
like
any
number
of
pale
ales
but
the
flavor
is
exceptional
this
beer
balances
malt
and
hops
in
a
way
that
really
lets
the
hops
shine
through
without
being
overpowering
some
people
might
find
this
beer
too
hoppy
but
this
is
where
i
find
that
this
beer
really
separates
itself
from
other
pale
ales
while
maintaining
similar
bitterness
characteristics
to
similar
apas
this
beer
has
exquisite
subtle
floral
hop
aromas
and
flavors
that
really
make
this
beer
enjoyable
for
every
single
sip
this
is
a
beer
you
can
sip
in
while
working
in
the
yard
yet
it
still
has
bold
flavor
profiles
that
will
satisfy
your
hopfoward
palate
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
this
beer
up
when
its
on
sale
or
featured
in
a
mixed
12pack
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
very
very
drinkable
not
bitter
and
very
delicious
overall
it
is
a
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
apa
thats
a
winner
here
where
the
weather
is
usually
warm
to
hot
its
not
spectacular
but
it
is
quite
good
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
pale

great
bouquet

to

there
is
a

has
no

seems
to
have
some

not

so
am
disappointed
in
the

i
am
not

i
may

some
light

floral

taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
more
robust
and
with
just
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
with
nice
carbonation
bite
overall
for
a
session
beer
this
was
ok
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
and
a
very
solid
session
beer
and
has
become
one
of
my
go
to
session
beers
o
bold
bright
cleanashell
and
to
the
point
excellent
drinking
that
packs
a
punch
on
the
palate
but
is
deceptively
light
another
winner
from
fw
overall
okay
not
enough
malt
not
enough
hop
aroma
its
like
a
less
balanced
version
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
i
would
rather
drink
one
union
jack
than
two
of
these
another
boring
run
of
the
mill
ipa
the
market
is
becoming
oversaturated
with
pale
ales
and
firestone
is
no
exception
there
is
nothing
memorable
about
this
beer
and
honestly
if
i
hadnt
found
an
old
napkin
from
the
bar
i
wrote
this
down
on
i
wouldnt
have
even
remembered
it
it
is
plain
in
all
senses
of
the
word
and
there
is
nothing
memorable
about
this
beer
except
that
it
is
not
terrible
the
king
of
the
mediocre
category
if
there
ever
were
rating
b
its
not
out
of
control
but
a
very
very
nice
effort
all
the
way
nice
flavor
crisp
clean
hop
finish
overall
excellent
apa
they
crammed
a
lot
of
nicely
balanced
flavor
into
just
a
4
8
abv
brew
and
maybe
more
impressive
is
the
body
which
seems
bigger
than
it
really
is
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
good
beer
enjoyable
refreshing
good
body
and
nice
balance
not
strong
not
hoppy
light
if
that
makes
sense
easy
to
drink
not
the
strongest
of
pale
ales
in
terms
of
flavor
but
one
that
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
pours
a
very
thin
head
and
its
lighter
than
expected
in
color
i
would
happily
drink
it
again
but
it
will
not
be
given
priority
over
other
better
apas
that
can
be
purchased
in
my
area
o
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
is
somewhat
drinkable
even
though
it
tastes
pretty
hoppy
there
is
not
that
biscuit
or
bread
taste
you
want
with
a
pale
ale
and
instead
we
were
given
the
modern
taste
of
ales
with
a
hoppy
body
and
aftertaste
and
no
balance
of
malts
a
drink
with
this
much
distinction
combined
with
its
subtlety
is
rare
in
my
experience
a
true
showcase
for
what
hops
in
the
right
hands
can
do
for
a
brew

as

firestone
walkers
pale
31
pours
a
rich
pale
color
with
an
appropriate
carbonation
it
has
the
strong
aroma
of
turkish
delights

those
of
you
who
have
tried
these
tasty
and
gooey
little
sugar
cubes
that
also
radiates
sugar
white
rose
and
perhaps
underripe
apricots
the
first
sip
comes
with
a
head
that
wont
quit
and
a
particularly
artificial
flavor
that
comes
with
lowend
canned
beers
like
pbr
albeit
this
flavor
is
light
a
larger
mouthful
reveals
a
weak
body
with
a
mouthfeel
like
many
other
light
beers
the
flavor
is
the
sweet
and
bitter
you
would
expect
from
a
pale
ale
that
disappears
quickly
the
aftertaste
however
is
this
beers
saving
grace
this
lingering
flavor
is
that
of
light
and
summer
sweetened
hops
and
some
malt
that
brings
you
to
have
another
and
yet
another
sip
this
beer
is
nothing
to
call
home
about
but
certainly
not
at
all
bad
very
approachable
and
drinkable
pale
ale
theyre
not
trying
to
break
the
mold
and
the
low
abv
is
rather
obvious
in
how
it
tastes
a
very
easy
if
not
basic
drinker
o
good
beer
at
best
not
the
best
firestone
offering
would
not
revisit
but
might
be
slightly
above
average
o
what
a
great
drinkable
summer
beer
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
more
often
o
honestly
not
a
bad
apa
the
appearance
and
aroma
is
pretty
meh
but
the
taste
is
nice
surprisingly
decent
hop
character
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
crisp
and
refreshing
sessionable
for
sure
pretty
much
the
very
definition
of
an
apa
in
my
opinion
gritty
bitterness
with
a
floral
touch
nice
citrusy
notes
of
lemon
and
pith
faint
pine
kiss
of
white
grape
maybe
very
dry
effervescent
finish
with
seltzery
bubbles
appropriate
lighter
feel
and
ease
for
drinking
solid
and
fresh
interestingly
the
sweet
caramel
malts
make
way
to
a
slightly
peppery
hop
note
there
is
a
modest
hop
bite
at
the
end
that
reminded
me
of
something
like
pepper
it
was
definitely
not
spicy
but
there
you
have
it
overall
an
above
average
sweeter
apa
with
california
style
hopping
above
average
for
a
pale
ale
if
i
wanted
a
pale
ale
i
would
certainly
reach
for
this
overall
a
pleasant
pale
ale
and
representative
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
gold
body
with
a
frothy
head
and
decent
retention
very
grassy
hops
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
has
a
vegetal
quality
that
im
not
too
fond
of
lemony
and
soapy
as
well
but
not
a
fan
of
this
one
very
much
simple
but
enjoyable
apa
that
provides
a
nice
mix
of
cascade
citrus
with
some
spicy
floral
hops
as
well
crisp
and
refreshing
oa
bit
disappointing
i
was
able
to
put
down
my
pint
very
quickly
though
because
none
of
the
flavors
were
actually
off
putting
o
solid
solid
solid
for
style
i
am
wholly
unsure
of
the
freshness
given
the
date
on
the
bottle
but
it
seems
to
hold
its
own
quite
well
clearly
an
entrylevel
beer
with
no
palate
whack
but
thats
ok
too
o
not
bad
just
dont
get
the
wow
factor
most
important
test
i
feel
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
nice
not
must
have
o
this
pale
is
somewhat
of
a
tightrope
walk
but
a
successful
one
great
balance
as
the
hops
have
plenty
of
bitter
bite
but
share
the
spotlight
with
a
substantial
malt
body
whats
more
impressive
is
that
a
somewhat
larger
bodied
pale
like
this
can
still
be
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
despite
that
bit
of
extra
heft
balance
really
is
the
key
to
drinkability
o
a
good
solid
if
not
particularly
exciting
pale
ale
would
pick
union
jack
over
this
at
a
similar
price
point
myself
but
those
who
dislike
hop
bite
in
their
beer
would
likely
prefer
this
or
dba
which
i
reviewed
yesterday
this
is
more
an
american
pale
than
dba
but
i
might
pick
31
over
dba
as
a
summer
refresher
if
it
were
available
then
overall
pretty
much
as
pale
as
it
going
to
be
short
simple
and
enjoyable
i
dont
review
beers
often
but
when
i
do
its
because
they
really
really
stand
out
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
overall
pretty
nice
nice
hops
just
enough
malts
very
drinkable
and
tasty
very
drinkable
beer
great
beer
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
goes
down
with
ease
nice
session
beer
quite
dry
in
the
long
and
hoppy
finish
worth
a
try
osolid
pale
ale
o
this
is
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
32oz
growler
from
the
bowery
whole
foods
pours
a
clear
light
orange
color
with
a
12
inch
of
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
orange
with
some
malts
and
hints
of
tropical
fruits
the
taste
is
some
bitter
orange
peel
floral
hops
and
malts
slightly
bready
a
tad
watery
malt
finish
with
more
floral
notes
as
well
as
some
orange
peel
light
mouthfeel
but
its
expected
considering
the
low
abv
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
that
would
be
great
for
summer
hoping
this
gets
canned
one
day
overall
one
of
the
more
flavorful
lower
abv
pales
i
have
had
in
awhile
id
buy
it
again
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
here
for
a
goto
session
ale
west
coast
style
unfortunately
pale
31
doesnt
really
deliver
when
i
think
of
how
this
could
be
better
i
imagine
something
by
sierra
nevada
i
think
that
beer
would
combine
a
better
malt
balance
more
superb
mouthfeel
and
sharper
bitterness
this
is
decent
but
im
hoping
for
better
luck
next
time
overall
while
not
a
union
or
double
jack
in
flavor
potency
this
modest
brew
packs
tons
of
flavor
into
a
mere
4
9
abv
really
this
is
a
very
balanced
brew
at
a
more
modest
abv
with
a
great
flavor
profile
and
a
wonderful
drinkability
fantastic
for
the
style
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
receded
to
a
white
ring
leaving
no
lacing
it
looks
okay
but
not
as
good
as
some
scents
of
citruszest
pine
resin
grapefruit
and
faint
hints
of
floral
hops
and
malt
a
bit
more
hopforward
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
with
more
citrus
grapefruit
and
pine
very
good
but
not
as
balanced
as
sierra
nevadas
flavor
begins
with
a
moderate
level
of
hops
with
bitter
citruszest
grapefruit
and
pine
dominating
these
flavors
stick
around
throughout
the
sip
towards
the
middle
a
bit
more
floral
hop
flavors
come
through
in
the
background
but
not
heavily
malt
is
present
though
on
the
breadier
grainer
side
not
much
sweet
caramel
or
toffee
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
finish
is
dry
with
citruszest
grapefruit
and
pine
resin
dominating
aftertaste
is
bitter
with
a
grainy
malt
flavor
pretty
good
more
hop
forward
and
less
balanced
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
certainly
doesnt
hurt
the
flavor
profile
it
just
makes
it
a
different
take
on
a
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
semidrying
a
bit
less
smooth
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
more
of
an
ipa
mouthfeel
but
not
bad
to
drink
at
all
it
makes
you
want
to
drink
another
sip
right
after
you
finish
overall
this
is
another
good
american
pale
ale
while
not
as
balanced
as
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
it
has
a
good
aroma
and
flavor
profile
that
balance
more
towards
the
hopforward
side
of
things
while
still
keeping
a
sessionable
abv
and
providing
a
good
drinking
experience
from
the
mouthfeel
i
recommend
it
o
good
refreshing
beer
but
for
me
not
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
torpedo
i
could
give
it
a
shot
again
but
under
different
environment
in
a
warm
saturday
right
after
lunch
i
prefer
the
malt
flavor
of
this
a
bit
more
less
munich
i
believe
than
snpa
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
great
everyday
drinker
the
verdict
very
good
about
as
hoppy
as
a
pale
ale
could
get
without
crossing
into
ipa
category
and
much
hoppier
than
a
lot
of
cheap
offbrand
ipas
without
their
nasty
bitterness
another
winning
brew
from
firestone
im
not
a
fan
of
hops
and
this
beer
is
a
little
hopy
but
for
a
person
that
does
not
like
hops
its
actually
pretty
good
the
bitterness
is
controlled
a
little
much
on
the
carbonation
but
overall
another
finer
from
firestone
this
is
by
know
means
a
light
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
lots
to
enjoy
overall
a
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
take
on
this
great
style
and
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
for
a
4
8
beer
i
would
gladly
order
this
again
with
food
or
to
take
home
to
crack
open
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
wont
knock
me
on
my
ass
unfortunately
its
not
too
common
in
my
local
market
otherwise
id
likely
find
myself
drinking
it
quite
a
bit
on
draft
at
taphouse
in
seattle
worried
they
have
me
the
wrong
beer
poured
cloudy
yellow
with
a
bit
of
head
in
a
pint
glass
aroma
of
some
citrus
and
yeast
funk
flavor
follows
with
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
bad
wheat
beer
or
hefe
dirty
wheat
finish
bits
of
citrus
and
banana
a
touch
of
sweet
citrus
hops
light
mouthfeel
whatever
this
was
it
was
not
good
and
i
cant
imagine
my
favorite
brewery
fw
would
try
to
pass
this
off
as
a
pale
ale
blegh
will
have
to
try
again
when
i
visit
the
west
coast
overall
solid
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
something
to
keep
in
mind
when
you
want
a
pale
ale
with
a
little
more
of
a
malt
bill
certainly
wont
be
confused
with
an
ipa
like
some
pale
ales
overall
this
was
good
but
not
great
pours
golden
colored
and
clear
with
a
small
foamy
head
that
retains
a
small
amount
of
lacing
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
strong
apple
aroma
with
underlying
citrus
tones
mixture
of
apple
and
citrus
tastes
nice
balanced
hops
taste
that
hits
you
midway
through
bitter
taste
that
retains
on
your
tongue
when
done
not
too
bitter
though
hops
are
moderate
perhaps
a
little
stronger
than
most
pale
ales
but
not
quite
as
strong
as
most
ipas
overall
a
very
good
beer
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
session
beers
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
for
sure
aroma
is
zesty
floral
lemonyherbal
and
very
hoppy
in
the
taste
grapefruit
orange
and
nectarine
fruityness
are
apparent
from
the
dry
hopale
yeast
combo
a
bit
of
lemon
candy
and
pine
are
in
effect
as
well
mellow
bitterness
on
a
pale
salt
water
toffee
like
malt
notes
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
semi
crisp
overall
this
is
an
interesting
pale
ale
id
give
it
another
go
easily
ov
a
decent
brew
but
certainly
nothing
that
is
going
to
wow
you
seems
like
this
was
made
to
be
a
simple
sessionable
pale
ale
with
a
kiss
of
hops
on
it
if
so
then
nicely
done
however
if
someone
just
shoved
a
glass
in
my
hand
and
said
taste
this
without
knowing
what
it
was
or
is
supposed
to
be
id
probably
just
say
its
nice
or
its
good
and
not
add
anything
to
it
o
better
than
i
was
expecting
an
interesting
hop
profile
well
hidden
alcohol
and
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
super
easy
to
drink
but
still
very
flavorful
nothing
very
unique
just
another
well
puttogether
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
firestone
walker
excellent
if
i
can
get
this
year
round
this
will
be
my
new
standard
bearer
for
the
style
i
am
so
glad
this
is
available
on
draught
at
the
better
beer
bars
bring
on
the
six
packs
nothing
is
over
barring
and
all
in
perfect
balance
which
is
something
most
pale
ales
now
lack
and
i
would
expect
no
less
from
this
brewery
let
alone
the
great
sessionable
abv
very
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
simultaneously
a
very
satisfying
and
unsatisfying
beer
the
lighter
body
subtle
hop
flavors
and
lighter
malt
character
leave
the
palate
constantly
wanting
just
a
touch
more
but
on
the
other
hand
you
can
have
more
at
4
9
this
is
a
tasty
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
o
sweet
and
light
with
a
nice
subtle
citrus
hop
punch
overall
the
flavor
is
great
and
the
abv
makes
it
session
able
or
chug
able
if
only
i
could
find
this
by
the
case
great
tasting
pale
ale
o
good
pale
for
sure
the
bitterness
from
the
dry
hopping
holds
it
back
from
being
totally
sessionable
but
you
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
light
bodied
and
clean
with
ample
carbonation
this
beer
is
great
of
session
beer
you
will
ever
find
it
was
wonderful
balance
with
some
nice
hop
presence
without
being
too
bitter
overall
initially
the
beer
comes
of
somewhat
light
its
character
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
it
acclimates
outside
the
bottle
a
charming
brew
a
bit
light
on
the
malt
for
a
apa
this
is
almost
like
a
light
ipa
very
drinkable
really
liked
this
one
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
leans
sweet
it
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
o
good
beer
not
great
but
good
i
would
like
this
much
more
if
there
were
either
more
hop
flavor
or
less
hop
bitterness
and
i
feel
like
theyve
missed
the
balance
with
this
one
that
said
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
and
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
in
the
future
o
a
pretty
underrated
pale
ale
id
put
this
ahead
of
sierra
nevada
any
day
but
the
price
point
is
a
tad
high
recommended
go
now
and
get
it
go
now
and
get
it
good
i
think
this
is
a
nice
summerpool
pale
ale
well
balanced
with
low
abv
means
you
can
have
quite
a
few
in
a
sitting
and
maintain
a
little
pricey
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
sessionable
pale
aler
with
a
good
hop
profile
look
no
further
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
this
style
in
the
end
i
prefer
the
sweetness
and
juiciness
that
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
has
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
11152012
pours
lightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice

with

overall
this
is
damn
good
session
pale
ale
very
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
no
complaints
at
all
really
enjoyed
this
one
nothing
particularly
outstanding
but
an
easy
drinking
well
done
apa
hoppy
upfront
but
well
balanced
overall
c
update
my
feelings
on
this
beer
have
not
changed
but
my
interpretation
of
the
rating
scale
has
consequently
i
have
adjusted
my
points
to
what
i
feel
it
truly
deserves
i
think
that
a
little
over
five
times
out
of
ten
id
grab
this
over
sierra
nevada
if
given
the
choice
all
other
things
being
equal
its
that
good
o
amazing
session
beer
that
should
be
used
as
a
benchmark
to
evaluate
all
other
pales
o
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
highly
quaffable
i
could
order
this
again
and
again
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
bubbly
golden
amber
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
grassy
hops
light
citrus
biscuit
malt
finishes
with
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
as
expected
from
the
style
flavor
is
light
but
well
balanced
an
enjoyable
refreshing
pale
ale
after
drinking
some
hefty
darker
strong
ales
and
stouts
the
last
week
its
nice
to
sit
back
and
watch
active
carbonation
in
a
nicely
made
light
golden
beer
o
a
fantastic
apa
and
one
of
my
go
tos
i
would
easily
put
this
up
there
with
3
floyds
zombie
dust
and
an
underrated
beer
on
ba
for
sure
d
id
like
to
think
that
i
got
an
old
bottle
but
its
barely
a
month
old
just
a
poor
example
of
the
style
its
easy
to
drink
but
theres
really
nothing
going
on
wont
be
having
this
again
o
a
flawless
easy
drinking
light
pale
ale
with
a
pleasant
flavor
very
pale
with
copper
color
and
clear
head
retention
is
great
big
rocky
head
that
laces
very
well
for
the
style
lemon
and
grapefruit
dominate
the
nose
with
floral
notes
and
slight
biscuit
flavor
is
lemony
and
bright
with
a
lot
of
orange
flavor
to
start
as
well
fades
to
overcooked
biscuit
and
slight
a
tartness
then
floral
hops
which
are
not
heavy
handed
bitterness
comes
on
gradually
but
its
definitely
noticeable
feel
is
middling
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
one
tasted
especially
fresh
i
could
drink
this
all
day
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
ale
at
a
low
abv
o
i
really
like
this
pale
ale
it
looked
phenomenal
and
tasted
really
good
too
overall
45
pale
31
has
a
lot
going
for
it
easydrinking
refreshing
and
very
flavorful
given
its
abv
not
too
expensive
for
a
sixer
at
least
by
chicago
standards10
99
for
a
sixpack
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
hopforward
beer
that
they
want
to
session
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
for
the
purpose
probably
even
better
in
the
summer
all
the
rest
have
31
and
seem
to
be
getting
drunker
by
the
day
wow
sorry
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
if
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
bright
grapefruit
zest
light
orange
zest
light
honey
and
a
bristling
of
pine
needles
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
citrus
blending
together
into
a
tasty
little
tropical
smoothie
the
parts
indistinguishable
from
the
whole
in
a
good
way
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
highly
drinkable
and
even
more
highly
enjoyable
good
times
o
good
not
great
get
it
if
you
can
but
there
are
better
pale
ales
out
there
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
fresh
malt
flavor
that
grows
to
over
take
the
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
it
would
be
nice
to
try
this
on
cask
to
see
if
more
nuances
come
out
after
reviewing
this
beer
i
went
to
fwbcs
website
i
am
very
surprised
to
see
the
hops
are
fuggle
cascade
centennial
and
chinook
some
of
my
favorites
this
is
why
i
love
beer
so
many
different
ways
to
accentuate
flavors

nothing

o

dry

pale
with

great

and
great
feel
the
pour
and
the
nose
left
some
to
be
desired
but
a
repeat
pick
pale
for
sure
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
it
is
a
little
high
on
the
hop
scale
for
the
style
maybe
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
a
refreshing
beer
with
good
balance
and
taste
allaround
nothing
earthshattering
or
innovative
per
se
just
a
darn
fine
beer
overall
seems
to
be
a
very
light
pa
not
offensive
to
someone
like
me
who
rarely
enjoys
hoppy
beer
but
likely
not
enjoyable
to
someone
who
does
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
very
good
on
this
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
massive
fresh
citrus
hop
aroma
the
smell
of
the
beer
seems
very
fresh
bright
and
lively
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
bitter
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
there
are
fruity
notes
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
to
it
overall
this
one
is
very
good
it
pushes
the
boundaries
of
being
an
apa
and
ipa
this
beer
could
go
either
way
i
think
its
very
good
though
regardless
hands
down
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
unlike
most
pale
ales
this
beer
has
the
clean
crisp
feel
and
appearance
of
a
lager
the
hoppiness
of
a
mild
ipa
and
the
most
incredible
hoppy
aroma
you
will
get
from
a
bottled
beer
along
with
the
intense
sweet
floral
aroma
the
dry
hopped
finish
creates
a
superbly
delicious
dry
aftertaste
besides
the
hops
the
beer
is
low
in
maltiness
yet
has
a
nice
light
bready
flavor
the
low
4
9
alcohol
content
will
allow
you
to
enjoy
more
than
one
on
a
work
night
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
refreshing
and
crisp
on
the
palate
really
easy
drinking
excellent
hop
profile
i
easily
took
down
2
pints
and
could
have
enjoyed
another
without
trouble
i
need
to
remember
to
buy
some
of
this
for
next
summer
this
would
be
perfect
for
backyard
barbecues
and
sunny
summer
afternoons
o
firestone
does
it
again
another
amazing
beer
that
seems
to
fit
the
style
perfectly
very
drinkable
pale
ale
that
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
pilsner
the
taste
is
really
crisp
hoppy
and
a
little
sweetness
at
the
end
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
medium
body
with
a
really
nice
bitterness
i
can
really
understand
why
the
took
gold
at
the
world
beer
cup
these
guys
know
how
to
brew
good
beer
overall
really
high
marks
all
around
i
think
they
nailed
it
and
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
beer
cheers
o
very
enjoyable
with
really
good
flavors
and
aromas
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
bitterness
of
the
hops
o
great
pale
ale
highly
recommended
for
the
style
highly
drinkable
and
sufficiently
hoppy
would
have
again
o
a
pretty
well
put
together
pale
ale
but
a
but
on
the
hoppyfloral
side
whereas
i
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
malt
forward
but
still
a
decent
beer
overall
the
one
i
had
to
sample
was
icy
cold
and
it
stands
up
very
well
to
the
chill
with
its
fragrance
and
crisp
flavor
its
one
beer
to
chill
when
you
want
a
cold
one
from
the
12
oz
bottle
i
am
getting
to
be
a
firestone
fan
firestone
walker
pale
31
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
goldenrod
darkening
towards
orange
when
the
beers
less
well
lit
a
light
dusting
of
white
foam
caps
the
beer
but
doesnt
provide
much
opportunity
for
either
head
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
has
a
nice
floral
aroma
offset
by
some
juicy
grapefruit
notes
it
doesnt
quite
jump
out
if
the
glass
as
much
as
it
could
though
the
flavor
is
fantastic
just
about
perfectly
balanced
for
a
pale
ale
theres
a
solid
foundation
of
caramel
sweetness
right
up
front
the
bitterness
that
comes
through
is
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
definitely
stays
short
of
ipa
level
intensity
the
hoppy
close
is
that
classic
floral
citrus
grapefruit
flavor
if
i
had
to
nitpick
i
would
say
that
the
finish
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
intensevibrant
but
its
pretty
close
the
body
is
nice
a
little
bit
solid
while
not
becoming
too
heavy
for
a
sub
5abv
beer
the
carbonation
is
definitely
a
touch
muted
though
pale
31
is
another
reminder
that
i
should
consider
myself
lucky
to
have
firestone
walker
readily
available
locally
this
is
as
other
people
have
mentioned
like
a
miniature
or
junior
union
jack
it
has
the
same
or
similar
hop
profile
but
with
a
light
body
to
it
my
only
knock
bottle
poured
into
glass
overall
an
exceptionally
hoppy
apa
i
enjoyed
it
but
maybe
a
bit
overdone
o
this
ale
is
a
great
thing
impressive
hop
flavours
the
spotlight
is
on
the
hops
the
dry
hopping
gives
it
a
flavour
that
is
not
present
with
traditional
hop
use
great
stuff
o
truly
a
session
beer
for
the
hop
inclined
not
even
5

an

of

carbonation
to
keep

its
not
as

as
one
may
expect
from
a
pale

for
me
that
makes
it
a
refreshing
take
on
the
style
its
a
simple
but
marvelously
executed
beer
a
great
anytime
pale
ale
i
was
initially
concerned
when
i
popped
the
cap
and
foam
began
to
slowly
seep
up
through
the
neck
but
it
stopped
shortly
thereafter
and
allowed
me
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
i
ended
up
with
a
finger
of
french
vanillacolored
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
very
pinelike
and
my
mouth
began
to
water
in
anticipation
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
hops
were
immediate
upon
making
contact
with
my
tongue
man
this
was
pretty
intense
for
an
apa
but
i
was
not
complaining
believe
me
finish
was
pleasantly
dry
and
the
malt
even
made
an
appearance
lots
of
sticky
lacing
was
in
evidence
as
i
finished
the
glass
o
this
is
a
very
pleasant
refreshing
and
tasty
apa
lots
of
bright
flavors
and
aromas
very
juicy
and
crisp
good
as
a
session
brew
solid
oi
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
their
more
popular
dba
and
more
then
sierra
nevada
its
highly
sessionable
and
its
a
surprise
the
low
abv
ill
have
another
doa
o
really
nice
offering
but
nothing
special
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
3

heres
a
nice
little
easygoing
pale
ale
i
had
this
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
funky
buddha
berliner
weisses
to
go
on
served
in
a
shaker
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
delightful
puff
of
white
head
that
sank
quite
a
bit
but
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
way
down
not
much
in
the
aroma
from
what
i
could
perceive
anyway
light
toasted
grains
floral
hops
pretty
standard
stuff
taste
of
sweet
biscuity
malts
nicely
balanced
by
fresh
floral
hops
slight
citrus
notes
light
crisp
basic
light
body
and
easily
drinkable
o
love
the
dank
resiny
pine
and
floral
notes
that
are
written
all
over
this
beer
made
its
way
up
with
some
of
the
best
and
its
readily
available
solid
4
all
the
way
across
overall
a
wellcrafted
take
on
the
style
its
no
double
barrel
ale
but
it
carries
the
same
level
of
balance
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
firestone
walker
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
some
pine
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
herbalpine
hops
and
some
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
with
a
nice
balanced
malt
and
hop
flavor
that
is
easy
drinking
o
drank
this
way
too
fast
overall
its
a
perfect
light
summer
hoppy
session
ale
not
overwhelming
in
any
category
just
plain
solid
i
am
actually
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
beer
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
unlike
anything
ive
encountered
from
firestone
walker
and
i
approve
i
hope
this
starts
to
show
up
on
the
east
coast
because
i
would
drink
this
often
overall
a
highly
drinkable
balanced
pale
ale
expertly
brewed
but
i
prefer
them
a
bit
hoppier
taste
is
nice
dryish
orangebread
crust
with
spicy
peppery
citrusy
bitterness
jammy
citrus
and
spicy
bitterness
its
nice
wellmade
and
nicely
integrated
as
firestone
walker
beers
seem
always
to
be
but
not
great
and
a
bit
to
utterly
west
coast
for
my
tastes
94
overall
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
well
balanced
though
a
bit
safe
nothing
here
that
makes
the
brew
stand
out
but
its
a
quality
allaround
product
this
pale
ale
really
benefits
from
the
barrel
characteristics
as
they
make
it
subtly
complex
as
it
warms
big
interesting
hop
character
dry
and
my
current
favorite
pale
ale
fantastic
overall
this
will
likely
be
my
new
go
to
pa
because
of
how
well
its
put
together
not
mindblowing
or
distinct
by
any
means
yet
an
all
together
spot
on
pa
the
light
body
is
easydrinking
and
certainly
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
only
slightly
fizzy
making
this
beer
crisp
and
easyswallowed
a
bright
refreshing
drink
o
solid
pale
ale
the
hop
and
malt
flavors
are
rather
subtle
but
work
together
well
its
just
an
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
fairly
light
in
body
with
carbonation
high
enough
to
make
this
foam
up
gently
on
the
palate
the
result
is
a
pillowy
mouthfeel
which
suits
the
beer
fairly
well
finish
is
semidry
o
overall
i
felt
it
was
a
good
pale
ale
could
be
better
but
definitely
not
bad
o
this
is
an
a
pale
ale
for
me
not
up
there
with
zombie
dust
or
headwaters
but
very
good
carbonation
was
crisp
body
pretty
light
and
the
finish
was
short
and
dry
tasty
but
not
exactly
exceptional
or
memorable
for
me
perhaps
a
little
unexciting
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
it
has
never
tasted
the
same
each
time
fortunately
this
time
out
of
the
tap
it
suited
my
taste
better
than
any
other
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
distinct
citrus
bouquet
no
head
at
all
but
this
is
likely
the
bar
tenders
choice
in
the
way
she
poured
to
fit
as
much
beer
in
the
pint
as
possible
an
easily
discernible
citrus
up
front
with
an
alternating
citrus
and
less
present
pine
at
the
finish
a
wellbalanced
grain
and
hop
concoction
an
excellent
example
of
a
pale
ale
a
competitor
for
sierra
nevada
as
a
go
to
quintessential
american
pale
ale
well
crafted
pale
exceptional
balance
albeit
very
simple
and
mild
very
drinkable
a
good
craft
entry
beer
note
my
bottle
did
not
have
a
31
on
it
it
just
said
pale
o
a
middleofthepack
pa
o
very
drinkable
pale
light
and
refreshing
great
citrus
and
juicy
hops
for
a
low
abv
pale
it
has
good
complexity
i
recognize
its
very
good
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
id
always
reach
for
a
dales
instead
above
average
though
decent
pale
ale
if
a
bit
boring
pours
a
nice
looking
honey
color
crystal
clear
with
a
2
inch
white
head
that
lazes
around
the
whole
time
smells
like
a
beer
period
flavor
is
light
and
citrusy
with
a
crystal
and
pale
malt
body
mouthfeel
is
fine
well
carbonated
and
crisp
good
pale
ale
but
nothing
special
on
the
lighter
side
very
sessionable
especially
at
the
low
abv
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
good
west
coast
styled
pale
ale
great
maltiness
with
a
definite
hop
profile
oa
good
pa
pretty
tame
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
like
i
said
i
would
gladly
session
with
this
during
the
summer
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
in
fact
its
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
its
on
par
with
stones
pale
ale
which
is
a
beer
i
cant
help
to
compare
hoppy
pale
ales
to
this
beer
is
excellent
and
i
wish
firestone
was
in
my
area
but
sadly
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
utah
pours
a
light
golden
color
theres
a
nice
inviting
hop
aroma
to
this
its
sweeter
than
i
remember
with
a
crisp
finish
not
as
hoppy
as
expectedor
remembered
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
tasty
pale
ale
buti
almost
hate
to
say
it
but
i
prefer
the
mission
st
ale
over
this
light
to
medium
body
great
tasting
pale
ale
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
a
great
refreshing
summer
beer
and
a
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
o
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
similar
to
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
although
with
less
abv
and
calories
which
is
pretty
impressive
great
session
beer
eerily
close
to
the
trader

can

light
mouthfeel
rather
thin
overall
a
decent
beer
certainly
sessionable
but
not
something
id
typically
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
this
is
a
california
style
apa
and
i
couldnt
find
any
info
about
that
style
maybe
a
hoppy
steam
beer
i
thought
this
beer
pretty
good
even
with
the
lighter
taste
could
be
a
session
or
yard
beer
perhaps
for
me
this
beer
is
a
tweener
it
tries
to
be
hoppy
like
an
apa
but
also
tries
to
be
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
like
an
english
pale
ale
its
tasty
but
if
i
wanted
something
more
hopforward
id
go
with
snpa
or
liberty
ale
and
if
i
wanted
something
smoother
or
more
sessionable
id
go
with
an
englishstyle

alcohol
it
has
a
good
bite
of
bitterness
to
it
and
the
hop
profile
is
more
in
vein
of
an
ipa
though
probably
more
drinkable
to
the
average
beer
drinker
i
think
beers
like
this
are
really
important
for
the
craft
beer
market
a
mid
priced
6
pack
that
is
quite
drinkable
and
could
possibly
win
over
some
drinkers
of
more
commercial
beers
taste
wise
i
feel
like
this
tastes
like
a
very
mild
ipa
and
because
i
love
ipas
i
think
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
stronger

is
more
of
the
same
but
this
is
not
an
ipa
it
feels
lighter
in
body
and
so
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
found
my
new
go
to
pale
ale
because
this
has
less
alcohol
than
sierra
nevada
and
i
might
just
prefer
the

great
stuff
t
hard

kind
of
taste
some
people
may
like
it
but
not
me
not
much
sweetness
i
will
say
on
the
bitter
side
i
liked
this
one
even
following
union
jack
and
double
union
jack
this
one
was
assertive
and
tasty
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
on
the
dry
side
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
really
drink
a
few
of
as
its
lighter
in
body
but
full
of
flavor
they
call
it
a
california

i
would
like
to
make
it

easy

thats
just
aggressive
enough
to
remind
me
that
im
drinking
a
intentionally
restrained
beer
i
love
that
this
isnt
an
ipa
labeled
as
a
pale
ale
and
that
its
actually
true
to
style
not
overly
bitter
or
hopped
up
beyond
belief
very
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
and
an
exemplary
example
of
what
a
session
beer
can
be
when
made
well
incidentally
this
is
my
second
fw
beer
im
starting
off
with
their
easytofind
ones
and
ive
been
very
impressed
with
both
while
this
one
wont
go
down
as
my
favorite
pale
ale
i
like
it
i
would
still
take
a
sierra
nevada
or
something
over
it
but
this
one
is
a
good
choice
if
you
prefer
more
of
the
pineyspicy
flavors
in
your
pale
ale
over
the
citrus
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
tasty
but
clean
pale
ale
thats
not
to
robust
or
strong
but
very
satisfying
i
can
see
really
sucking
down
a
bunch
of
this
at
a
party
this
immediately
became
my
all

favorite
apa

this

i
liked

great
session
beer
my
last
review
contained
a
bit
of
a
diatribe
about
bottle
shape
and
label
design
so
i
think
that
ill
continue
that
this
doesnt
really
have
much
to
do
with
my
enjoymentreview
of
the
beer
i
like
firestones
packaging
its
pleasantly
understated
compared
to
most
beer
labeling
the
label
is
interesting
but
not
crazy
the
bottle
has
sort
of
a
classic
look
i
like
that
they
maintain
their
design
across
most
of
their
beers
i
dont
love
firestone
beers
but
i
like
that
they
dont
use
each
new
beer
has
an
opportunity
for
a
new
label
design
sometimes
that
works
but
not
many
other
craft
beer
companies
admittedly
firestone
is
rather
large
now
and
probably
has
a
lot
more
budget
for
marketing
have
such
a
solid
consistent
look
theres
something
classy
about
such
an
understated
look
d
the
dry
crisp
mouthfeel
mixed
with
good
carbonation
makes
this
very
drinkable
if
this
was
readily
available
in
my
area
id
seek
it
out
for
a
night
out
at
friends
drinkability
almost
like
a
lite
pale
ale
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
enjoy
it
but
your
average
coors
light
drinker
could
suck
a
pale
31
down
without
complaining
about
the
bitterness
i
know
many
hold
this
up
as
one
of
the
great
pale
ales
and
im
inclined
to
agree
when
you
consider
the
whole
package
it
holds
nearly
the
same
depth
of
hop
flavor
as
sierra
nevada
but
with
a
lighter
body
its
much
more
drinkable
the
malts
have
a
light
bready
malt
taste
thats
matched
first
by
piney
citrus
hops
and
then
later
a
spicy
longlasting
aftertaste
how
this
beer
drinks
actually
reminds
me
of
a
good
english
bitter
for
the
ability
to
hold
complex
flavors
in
a
light
and
highly
sessionable
beer
the
aroma
was
fairly
subdued
i
got
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
nose
with
a
peach
focus
the
taste
was
clean
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
it
was
moderate
to
well
carbonated
with
a
tad
bit
of
bite
at
the
end
of
the
drink
definitely
a
session
beer
that
would
be
a
good
barbeque
brew
in
the
summer
overall
not
bad
but
could
of
used
a
bit
of
more
hop
presence
in
the
beer
good
pale
ale
with
complex
flavors
but
not
really
great
i
think
i
would
still
take
a
regular
old
sierra
nevada
over
this
or
the
regular
firestone
drinkability
is
great
great
balance
nice
malt
and
hop
character
both
coming
through
strong
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
the
time
good
stuff
d
if
i
lived
out
west
this
would
be
a
go
to
session
beer
good
bitterness
but
not
so
much
that
i
wont
be
able
to
taste
my
next
beer
not
like
snpa
which
can
tend
to
overload
the
palate
i
wish
we
could
get
an
apa
like
this
in
new
england
drinkability
is
great
and
is
easily
this
beers
strong
suit
this
beer
is
not
going
to
wow
you
at
all
but
its
quite
tasty
yet
light
enough
to
be
very
sessionable
seems
like
a
hybrid
pale
that
is
part
british
and
part
american
will
be
a
great
one
to
grab
during
our
warm
summers
here
in
northern
california
i
hope
this
stays
around
my
local
liquor
shop
for

ill
be

to

i
like

its

for

would
go

with

something
as
there
is

to
it

standalone
is

is

i
would

this
if

is
an
ok
repersentation
od
a
pale
ale
solid
apa
across
the
board
and
definitely
has
the
california
vibe
to
it
will
make
a
return
in
my
fridge
as
often
as
i
can
find
it
got
this
one
on
tap
on
my
recent
trip
to
anaheimat
tony
romasvery
nice
butterscotch
color
to
it
with
a
slight
tan
head
and
mild
lacing
nose
was
of
floral
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
and
mild
hops
taste
was
mild
fruitpeach
tinge
to
itvery
mild
bitterness
all
going
down
rather
easilykinda
watery
but
enjoyablevery
lite
and
mild
mouthfeeloverallquite
a
nice
brew
and
worth
another
shot
the
color
when
poured
was
of
an
amber
golden
yellow
with
a
little
foam
that
clinged
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
pine
with
a
hint
of
floral
after
notes
the
taste
was
between
an
ipa
and
a
pale
ale
nice
balance
of
bitterness
and
smoothness
on
the
aftertaste
also
you
can
taste
beside
the
hops
the
malts
with
a
slight
floral
and
a
touch
of
spices
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
an
almost
nonexistent
white
head
i
can
taste
some
citrus
flavors
this
beer
is
much
lighter
than
i
expected
and
it
goes
down
like
water
certainly
not
bad
but
not
much
going
on
here
and
not
what
i
expected
this
was
a
nice
golded
colored
brew
with
a
pleasent
hop
character
i
had
this
on
a
very
hot
day
with
a
barbeque
diner
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
a
nice
warm
weather
session
beer
low
abv
and
a
nice
clean
hop
flavor
yeah
this
worked
d
for
4
6
this
goes
down
easy
but
im
not
sure
how
many
more
id
want
12oz
bottle
gold
color
with
a
firm
white
head
hoppy
and
bright
aroma
with
some
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
light
and
drinkable
but
with
a
nice
hoppiness
and
medium
bitter
finish
im
still
not
sure
if
they
actually
changed
the
recipe
from
the
old
pale
ale
but
the
samples
that
i
have
had
do
seem
hoppier
and
more
flavorful
than
the
old
stuff
not
as
big
as
a
traditional
nontraditional
west
coast
apa
which
is
to
say
balanced
and
drinkable
might
be
a
good
gateway
beer
with
which
to
lure
the
beerlovertobe
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
ipa
errr
pale
ale
definitely
recommended
very
smooth
and
drinkable
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
stoudts
apa
but
i
think
this
one
might
even
be
a
little
better
pale
31
is
light
goldamber
with
a
thin
white
lace
light
aromas
of
citrus
zest
and
a
wisp
of
grain
squeeky
clean
pale
malt
flavors
with
snappy
bittering
a
little
cereal
grain
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
middle
but
quickly
fades
to
a
quenching
dry
finish
thin
but
vibrant
and
bubbly
on
the
palate
fairly
long
clean
finish
with
some
herbal
hops
and
mineral
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
pleasant
and
very
clean
pale
ale
good
for
quaffing
but
not
terribly
exciting
drinkable
but
not
interesting
enough
for
a
long
session
i
agree
with
overlord
on
this
one
not
my
style
of
pale
ale
at
all
pours
an
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
the
best
part
was
the
smell
nice
floral
and
hop
aroma
with
some
biscuit
and
caramel
undertones
hits
the
palatte
with
a
one
liner
hop
profile
which
just
happens
to
be
one
that
i
do
not
enjoy
the
malt
and
biscuit
come
in
last
to
clean
it
up
but
is
still
unbalanced
and
doesnt
leave
me
happy
an
ok
pale
ale
but
much
better
out
there
mouthfeel
was
okay
bubbly
appropriate
for
the
pale
ale
style
a
nice
little
pale
ale
thats
expensive
for
the
style
but
good
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
it
had
a
medium
body
the
finish
was
relatively
short
with
bitterness
and
citrus
lasting
on
the
tongue
nicely
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
may
be
a
turnoff
to
some
here
flavor
is
straight
pale
ale
malts
are
bready
and
finish
dry
hops
are
floral
and
a
bit
piney
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
that
it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
dry
finish
that
makes
this
beer
even
more
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
exemplary
drinkability
is
high
drinkability
this
stuff
goes
down
ridiculously
easy
its
gone
before
you
know
it
the
ideal
session
beer
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
little
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
and
pine
hops
mixed
with
malt
it
tasted
like
copper
hops
balanced
evenly
with
malt
it
was
pretty
thick
and
oily
with
a
little
carbonation
and
had
a
very
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
pale
ale
but
nothing
too
special
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
really
a
very
nicely
down
pale
with
very
little
errors
at
all
lots
of
nice
flavors
with
a
good
balance
between
bready
and
cereal
like
malts
and
the
light
floral
hops
very
nicely
balanced
i
would
have
loved
to
have
had
a
few
more
of
these
as
well
definitely
a
high
quality
session
ale
and
something
that
i
do
not
think
i
would
ever
turn
down
light
clear
amber
pour
with
a
fading
white
head
smell
is
very
sweet
hops
fresh
and
vibrant
at
first
followed
soon
by
a
bit
of
metal
a
bit
thin
overall
and
i
get
a
flavor
of
tea
in
this
one
quite
a
bit
along
with
some
light
honey
like
malt
good
carbonation
and
while
not
offensive
pretty
average
and
needs
more
of
a
strong
malt
backing
to
shine
decent
d
nice
balance
easy
to
drink
big
piney
hop
aroma
when
first
poured
malt
became
apparent
as
hop
aroma
settled
down
clear
goldenamber
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
and
minimal
lacing
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
malty
slight
sweetness
and
caramel
overtones
nicely
balanced
by
hop
bitterness
and
a
mellow
hop
flavor
mediumlight
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
a
fairly
long
finish
a
good
hybrid
of
british
and
american
pale
ale
styles
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
light
pale
and
bisquit
malt
scent
along
with
mild
hop
aroma
and
a
light
oak
barrel
presence
the
aroma
is
quite
complex
and
highly
enticing
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
thin
pale
and
bisquit
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
bitter
with
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
the
barrel
taste
really
covers
up
the
simple
yet
refreshing
pale
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
its
got
an
interesting
flavor
palate
but
i
could
kill
a
sixer
of
these
easy
d
this
is
a
really
good
pale
up
there
with
anchor
and
alpha
king
possibly
the
best
made
in
ca
d
very
drinkable
beer
could
session
this
one
all
night
if
only
given
the
chance
back
home
worth
a
try
by
all
means
tasty
session
beer
moderately
bitter
finish
very
enjoyable
d
the
abv
is
perfect
as
is
the
flavor
this
is
a
solid
apa
great
taste
and
fantastic
hop
profile
fantastic
and
i
live
directly
in
the
middle
of
the
two
breweries
great
stuff
i
cant
believe
my
first
rating
of
this
sessionable
serviceable
drinkable
pale
floral
and
citrus
and
malty
aroma
light
colour
with
shortlasting
foam
tasty
and
citrus
hops
comcommitant
with
aggressive
carbonation
medium
or
less
body
slight
better
than
average
pale
average
beer
overall
d
it
was
so
good
i
wish
i
had
two
more
great
trade
brad
thanks
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
get
it
that
fresh
on
this
coast
it
makes
me
want
to
move
to
cali
an
interesting
beer
there
are
not
many
like
it
and
that
appeals
to
me
something
i
would
definitely
have
in
my
stock
ready
to
go
for
the
right
meal
the
site
says
asian
pan
but
it
seems
like
it
would
go
good
with
other
things
as
well
drinkability
its
okay
not
great
pretty
much
like
all
of
firestones
beers
all
pale
should
taste
this
good
worth
checking
out
but
i
am
sure
most
of
you
already
have
flavor
is
grainy
malt
and
husk
with
a
bit
of
white
grape
and
again
floral
hops
coming
through
an
easy
drinker
not
very
complex
but
well
crafted
the
body
was
a
little
thin
but
it
is
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
hoppy
pale
ale
but
its
not
an
ipa
which
i
was
pleased
to
be
the
case
too
often
a
brewery
will
over
hop
its
standard
pale
ale
and
it
just
comes
across
as
an
ipa
this
one
does
not
and
clearly
holds
its
ground
in
the
pale
ale
category
it
is
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
and
is
loaded
with
balanced
flavour
this
was
a
nice
first
sampling
for
me
from
the
firestone
walker
folks
a
very
nice
example
of
a
lessaggressive
american
pale
ale
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
strikes
me
as
a
good
warmweather
beer
and
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
cold
deli
sandwich
and
potato
chips
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
washing
the
car
this
would
also
be
a
good
intro
beer
for
converting
a
bmc
drinker
to
craft
beer
pours
a
clear
light
copper
hue
with
a
white
fluffy
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
quickly
to
a
thin
lacing
stickiness
is
very
spotty
here
and
there
very
mild
sweet
citrus
hop
odor
with
a
wonderful
carameltoffee
malt
blend
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
in
general
ive
experienced
by
far
the
best
smelling
pale
ale
such
a
unique
yet
pleasing
beer
to
put
your
nose
up
to
taste
is
amazing
as
well
once
again
mild
on
the
hops
but
clearly
there
citrus
hops
on
the
tongue
but
then
the
delicious
vanilla
malt
flavor
takes
combined
with
a
pepperyspice
flavor
aftertaste
is
very
smooth
and
pleasant
sweet
toffee
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
could
very
possibly
be
a
session
ale
at
4
6
abv
get
you
hands
on
this
if
you
can
thanks
for
thinking
of
me
my
brother
two
bottoms
up
thanks
to
hustlemuscle
for
sharing
the
beer
does
not
look
like
i
expected
it
is
light
reddish
gold
with
almost
no
head
ive
never
seen
a
pale
pale
ale
really
but
here
it
is
the
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
rose
hips
pine
resin
and
green
tea
with
a
sweet
note
underlying
it
all
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
again
floral
the
hops
dominate
but
not
too
hoppy
the
aftertaste
is
completely
dominated
by
hops
the
beer
is
refreshing
but
a
bit
astringent
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
despite
its
appearance
the
carbonation
adds
to
the
crisp
taste
to
make
this
a
very
refreshing
brew
indeed
the
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
content
puts
this
one
into
the
realm
of
session
beer
and
the
crispness
reminds
me
of
a
dry
cider
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
good
primer
on
what
aroma
hops
are
i
need
to
find
a
beer
newby
to
use
this
as
a
lesson
thanks
to
intriqken
for
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
smallish
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
breads
and
citrus
hops
very
nice
taste
is
tasty
sweet
malts
up
front
followed
by
pleasant
citrus
and
a
good
hop
finish
to
cleanse
the
palate
perfect
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
excellent
apa
very
refreshing
im
going
to
try
to
make
a
batch
of
home
brew
like
this
i
hope
its
as
good
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
color
has
a
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
wonderful
bouquet
of
citrusy
hops
the
flavor
is
citrusy
as
well
and
is
remarkably
pleasant
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
there
is
a
little
bit
of
crystal
malt
flavor
that
completes
this
ale
if
you
like
apa
style
this
is
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
great
beer
overall
striking
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
fizzes
out
pretty
fast
the
smell
is
rich
yet
hoppy
and
crisp
flavor
is
simple
enough
but
as
with
all
firestone
beers
incredibly
executed
light
sweet
malt
strikes
immediately
followed
by
a
brilliant
splash
of
hops
that
lingers
seductively
on
the
palate
i
feel
the
oakiness
in
their
beers
more
than
taste
and
it
feels
damn
good
drinkability
is
superb
great
drinkability
its
gone
before
you
know
it
after
the
disappointment
of
the
double
barrel
this
is
an
improvement
drinkability
very
drinkable
crisp
flavors
finishes
smooth
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
a
very
quenching
and
refreshing
beer
drinkability
i
think
the
crisp
flavors
in
the
bottled
version
make
this
beer
more
drinkable
than
the
sweet
malty
draft
offering
citrus
hop
notes
coupled
with
resiny
pine
flavors
fruit
notes
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
then
the
pine
flavors
toasted
grains
and
biscuit
flavors
round
out
the
malt
profiles
light
with
a
slight
slickness
in
the
finish
just
an
all
around
easy
drinking
pale
ale
good
example
of
the
style
perfect
for
a
session
brew
with
an
abv
lower
then
5
drinkability
what
a
nice
apa
superbly
balanced
and
a
low
abv
to
boot
a
little
too
much
chalkiness
on
the
finish
but
good
body
and
carbonation
otherwise
not
earthshattering
but
i
rather
liked
this
beer
exceptional
drinkability
and
not
something
to
overpower
food
or
shortcircuit
your
palate
a
really
wellmade
mild
ale
in
my
estimation
d
enjoyable
dont
know
about
sessionable
paired
well
with
my
whole
grain
portzels
balance
is
awesome
memorable
pale
if
not
one
of
my
faves
smell
and
taste
set
this
apa
apart
from
others
i
crave
a
hop
flower
aroma
in
my
pales
and
this
beer
delivers
big
time
ive
had
2ipas
with
less
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
very
crisp
delivering
hop
bitterness
with
a
slightly
nutty
finish
highly
drinkable
definitely
firestones
best
widely
available
offering
d
good
drinkability
smooth
pale
ale
that
would
be
easy
to
session
d
easily
drinkable
nothing
bad
about
this
one
a
sessionable
lighttasting
smooth
pale
ale
worthy
of
a
try
not
remotely
an
extreme
or
overthetop
beer
the
kind
of
nicely
made
craft
beer
that
you
could
spend
an
afternoon
with
especially
if
you
like
that
hop
crispness
my
favorite

oh

p
s
jim
cibak
we
miss
you
over
here
in
3fs
land
d
it
is
a
average
pale
ale
i
like
the
more
on
the
hoppy
side
but
it
is
not
bad
really
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
there
are
a

better

price

you

good

decent

profile
with

would

glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
harry
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
the
only
drawback
i
can
see
with
this
beer
would
be
that
you
might
look
for
something
with
a
little
bit
more
of
a
kick
to
it
overall
its
an
excellent
representation
of
style
while
at
the
same
time
keeping
the
beer
lighter
than
most
apas
poured
this
beer
into
a
tasting
glass
the
head
is
a
nice
creamy
white
lacing
with
beautiful
tiny
bubbles
and
amber
color
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
subtle
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
clean
crisp
and
hoppy
i
really
love
this
style
of
beer
the
drinkabililty
of
this
is
off
the
charts
in
college
ucsb
i
have
many
a
fuzzy
night
due
to
the
drinkabililty
of
this
beer
great
beer
oily
mouthfeel
but
very
clean
and
crisp
low
abv
and
excellent
balance
make
this
a
very
drinkable
apa
that
i
could
easily
session
not
a
particularly
special
brew
but
nonetheless
a
solid
offering
i
wouldnt
turn
down
nice
balance
with
this
pale
ale
and
solid
hop
aroma
but
the
thing
that
gets
me
about
this
beer
is
the
4
6
alcohol
for
some
reason
i
actually
expected
this
beer
to
be
at
least
5
but
still
easy
to
drink
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
close
nice
straw
color
without
that
much
of
a
head
great
one
to
try
out
much
like
another
firestone
beer
i
have
enjoyed
a
year
back
the
taste
is
great
refreshing
hoppy
and
just
slightly
sweet
you
need
to
like
hops
to
enjoy
this
but
ill
take
this
and
its
relatively
low
abv
4
6
any
day
over
swill
at
the
local
5
and
dime
notes
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
firestone
its
kind
of
funny
in
that
their
flagship
beer
the
double
barrell
is
the
only
one
i
found
to
be
not
to
my
liking
this
pale
ale
is
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
bbq
or
even
some
italian
dishes
fit
nicely
refreshing
and
with
some
depth
of
character
for
the
style
this
beer
is
great
highly
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
very
good
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
with
nice
citrus
and
herbal
notes
grapefruit
flavors
are
nicely
backed
up
by
some
mildly
sweet
malts
low
alcohol
presence
makes
this
one
a
nice
candidate
for
a
session
beer
this
may
be
the
ultimate
in
session
beers
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
drinkability
everyone
should
put
this
on
there
want
list
right
now
its
that
drinkable
i
will
pick
up
another
six
pack
of
this
soon
and
drink
it
in
the
shade
overlooking
the
pool
easy
too
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
better
than
i
was
expecting
d
very
drinkable
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
my
first
firestone
brew
will
buy
others
if
the
liquor
store
carries
them
overall
probably
my
favorite
pale
ale
im
not
too
fond
of
pale
ales
or
strongly
hoporiented
beers
in
general
but
this
has
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
doesnt
overpower
probably
not
the
best
choice
for
hoplovers
but
everyone
else
take
note
ill
have
another
please
the
west
is
blessed
with
many
fine
american
pale
ales
and
firestone
has
got
to
be
one
of
them
it
looks
like
your
classic
pale
ale
with
an
light
orange
crystal
clear
appearance
and
a
smell
of
fresh
pine
firestone
pale
ale
gives
you
a
dose
of
that
west
coast
feel
primarily
with
its
cascade
hops
it
is
crisp
has
a
nice
carbonated
bite
to
it
and
is
refreshing
thanks
len
d
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
just
a
relaxing
easy
beer
that
doesnt
make
my
head
spin
this
beer
looks
nice
pours
a
perfectly
transparent
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
and
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
for
an
apa
smell
is
nice
lots
of
hops
on
the
nose
more
than
normal
for
the
style
also
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
there
too
reminds
me
of
a
toned
down
ipa
taste
is
also
very
nice
hoppy
up
front
leading
the
way
to
a
roasted
malt
flavor
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
also
very
good
for
a
low
abv
beer
firestone
has
done
a
nice
job
here
nice
somewhat
darker
gold
color
im
suprised
as
to
how
clear
it
is
decent
hop
aromavery
very
fresh
citrus
whoa
great
hop
flavor
not
a
trace
of
bitterness
just
straight
ahead
hop
flavor
malty
backbone
is
balanced
very
well
some
lingering
sweetness
excellent
body
for
the
style
and
the
low
abv
very
very
drinkable
with
the
low
abv
this
could
go
on
all
night
damn
i
wish
i
could
get
this
one
locally
one
of
the
best
us
pales
i
have
had
ever
drinkability
because
of
its
low
abv
and
subtle
flavors
sessioning
and
drinking
would
be
very
easy
thanks
to
zorro
for
the
bottle
firestones
pale
ale
was
a
surprise
for
me
im
not
a
big
pale
ale
fan
to
start
with
plus
id
see
this
one
everywhere
in
all
the
liquor
stores
and
even
grocery
stores
so
i
figured
it
was
gonna
be
just
another
bland
ol
pale
yeah
i
know
i
know
its
a
terrible
way
to
judge
but
boy
was
i
pleasantly
surprised
it
had
a
wonderfully
smooth
feel
but
quite
lively
taste
nice
blend
of
favors
im
not
gonna
rush
out
to
buy
more
when
theres
so
many
other
beers
i
prefer
over
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
their
other
brews
have
impressed
me
too
hooray
for
firestone
smells
of
florally
hops
tastes
is
hoppy
thats
not
too
overpowering
keeps
in
balance
overall
for
this
style
the
hops
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
however
it
is
still
tasty
some
strange
aftertastes
linger
perhaps
because
of
the
barrelling
but
maybe
not
overall
a
pleasent
brew
worth
trying
received
from
zorro
in
bcg
bif
bottled
on
date
of
101105
is
printed
on
the
bottle
underrated
i
think
the
beer
is
a
gold
color
and
only
has
a
wispy
pale
draught
head
this
beer
has
an
incredible
fresh
hop
aroma
i
get
notes
of
apricots
some
peach
and
of
course
some
of
the
typical
citrus
notes
the
aroma
is
just
quite
striking
and
i
really
like
the
mix
of
fruit
character
that
the
hops
evoke
here
the
taste
is
pretty
light
and
refreshing
and
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
that
really
helps
to
accentuate
the
fruity
flavors
from
the
hops
the
hop
character
is
definitely
dominated
by
a
fresh
fruity
character
that
is
most
evocative
of
peaches
and
apricots
this
is
really
quite
nice
slightly
cloudy
decent
white
head
light
coppergold
in
color
the
aroma
is
rather
nice
though
i
get
mostly
malt
just
a
trace
of
a
fruitypiney
blend
probably
hops
and
esters
it
doesnt
knock
me
out
but
the
maltiness
is
good
the
flavor
is
great
absolutely
tremendous
a
delicious
rich
grainy
maltiness
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
notes
followed
by
a
clean
bitterness
that
compliments
the
flavor
very
well
this
is
clearly
a
pale
ale
although
its
balance
seems
tilted
toward
the
malt
a
little
more
than
normal
i
think
this
is
awesome
drinkability
well
i
got
a
single
and
im
going
slowly
and
i
wont
buy
this
in
bottles
again
its
just
too
watery
smell
just
isnt
enough
to
sell
a
beer
no
matter
how
great
the
nose
is
poured
a
golden
applejuice
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
12
offwhite
head
the
aroma
was
exceptional
i
could
smell
it
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
and
it
just
got
better
when
i
poured
it
in
my
glass
aromas
of
pine
and
citrus
a
wonderfully
fresh
and
hoppy
smell
the
taste
is
relatively
mellow
and
smooth
it
may
smell
like
a
hopbomb
but
its
actually
a
very
balanced
beer
definitely
a
pale
ale
and
not
an
ipa
or
a
typically
overly
bitter
west
coast
pale
ale
yes
a
generalization
but
often
true
in
my
opinion
while
mellow
the
taste
is
actually
quite
full
and
rich
its
initially
mildly
sweet
with
a
grassy
flavor
followed
by
a
malty
middle
with
hints
of
lemon
peel
the
finish
lingers
with
a
mild
bitterness
earthy
woody
and
rootlike
flavors
a
beer
thats
very
drinkable
and
can
simply
be
enjoyed
but
take
some
time
to
notice
the
subtle
complexities
of
this
wellcrafted
brew
notes
i
read
this
one
is
fermented
in
oak
barrels
but
i
didnt
really
pick
up
on
this
characteristic
in
my
samples
its
very
subtle
but
a
nice
touch
likely
why
this
ipa
tastes
as
complex
as
it
does
worth
trying
overall
this
beer
was
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
flavor
but
it
was
simply
too
thin
for
my
tastes
still
because
of
that
makes
for
a
surprisingly
good
session
brew
4
6
this
is
a
nice
golden
color
that
poured
a
good
two
finger
head
that
has
sustained
quite
well
nose
is
of
citrusy
malts
taste
reminds
me
of
an
esb
as
it
has
a
stronger
malt
presence
than
anticipated
at
the
start
and
finishes
with
a
nice
citrusy
floral
hop
with
the
malts
still
present
mouthfeel
is
ok
decently
carbonated
and
heavy
enough
for
the
style
drinkability
is
near
perfect
for
a
session
this
makes
for
a
great
tail
gate
brew
uf
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
chill
hazed
honey
amber
body
with
an
offwhite
head
that
rises
about
one
centimeter
and
stays
there
good
patch
lacing
effect
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
with
inviting
esters
of
orange
tangerine
and
grapefruit
malty
caramel
is
in
the
background
and
there
is
a
hint
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
barrel
fermentation
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
crisp
moderate
carbonation
taste
features
juicy
citrusy
hops
with
orange
and
grapefruit
lending
a
soft
bitterness
caramel
and
toffee
notes
serve
up
a
pleasant
malt
balance
a
hint
of
oaky
vanilla
adds
a
nice
touch
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
lingering
grapefruit
hops
bitterness
that
is
soft
and
mild
very
nicely
balanced
and
rather
tasty
abv
is
under
5
so
this
one
would
make
an
exceptional
session
ale
very
nice
beer
one
that
i
would
recommend
for
anyone
who
likes
hops
or
someone
who
has
just
gotten
into
hops
and
does
not
want
to
be
blown
totally
away
its
ok
dog
drinkability
is
above
average
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
the
taste
is
nice
and
its
not
filling
ok
just
noticed
i
have
already
reviewed
this
one
similar
to
sierra
nevada
but
better
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
mouthfeel
is
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
as
the
taste
will
sit
nicely
on
the
tongue
allowing
you
to
savor
the
beer
the
taste
itself
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
that
complements
the
hops
real
well
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
white
foamy
longlasting
head
smell
is
of
pinescented
hops
has
a
nice
dry
hops
taste
that
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
dry
tsate
left
in
my
mouth
encouraged
additional
tasting
very
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
firestone
pale
ale
is
pretty
good
beer
that
would
benefit
from
a
slightly
more
assertive
nature
having
said
that
theres
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
a
pale
ale
that
doesnt
feel
like
blurring
the
distinction
between
an
apa
and
an
ipa
in
the
end
i
like
this
one
more
than
the
final
score
would
indicate
and
im
certain
that
id
drink
a
lot
of
it
if
it
was
brewed
locally
drinkability
coming
in
at
4
60
abv
i
could
do
this
all
day
almost
everyday
i
still
find
this
drinkable
and
better
than
the
macrobrew
alternatives
but
will
not
be
something
worth
shipping
across
the
country
for
others
to
try
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
pretty
much
a
standard
american
pale
ale
felt
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
overall
not
too
bad
i
liked
the
citrus
quality
in
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
it
had
a
medium
body
the
finish
was
relatively
short
with
bitterness
and
citrus
lasting
on
the
tongue
nicely
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
may
be
a
turnoff
to
some
here
sample
comes
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
light
copper
color
and
makes
about
an
inch
worth
of
fine
white
bubbly
head
smells
well
hopped
fruity
spicy
flavor
is
not
too
bitter
slightly
sweet
hops
make
a
slight
tartness
come
through
its
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
quite
drinkable
stuff
a
nice
session
beer
ive
now
tried
all
the
firestone
beers
that
i
have
seen
in
stores
this
pale
ale
poured
a
deep
gold
head
retention
was
so
so
but
my
glass
was
thick
with
lace
rings
sharp
aroma
of
hop
and
grain
inviting
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
solid
malt
base
lightly
hopped
i
did
detect
a
note
of
sweetness
like
others
have
mentioned
it
didnt
bother
me
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
this
is
a
drinkable
decent
beer
the
average
ratings
for
firestone
beers
seem
to
me
mostly
well
under
four
i
think
theyre
better
than
that
i
cant
say
id
be
eager
to
reach
for
another
one
of
these
it
just
seemed
to
wander
around
too
much
trying
to
figure
out
whether
it
should
be
hoppy
or
malty
in
the
end
firestone
pale
ale
remained
indecisive
and
only
a
mediocre
brew
very
drinkable
i
suspect
that
this
will
be
an
easy
and
very
pleasant
session
beer
if
you
dont
mind
a
bit
of
sweetness
i
will
buy
more
and
test
that
theory
personally
the
beer
as
it
pours
from
the
bottle
presents
an
unambiguous
copper
color
the
head
modest
in
size
and
the
color
a
beauteous
light
tan
it
vanishes
quite
quickly
leaving
a
fair
sheet
of
lace
behind
a
sturdy
hop
aroma
upfront
and
a
candy
like
sweetness
fresh
crisp
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
this
nose
start
is
overly
sweet
the
top
thin
to
medium
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
leniently
acidic
the
hops
perky
in
their
spicy
bite
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
a
nice
session
beer
me
thinks
but
does
seem
a
bit
too
sweet
but
nothing
i
cant
live
with
notes
label
reads
this
distinctive
pale
ale
boasts
a
bright
elegant
texture
with
hints
of
toffee
and
a
medium
malt
character
fermantation
in
individual
60
gallon
american
oak
barrels
imparts
soft
smoky
nuances
a
suggestion
of
vanilla
and
additional
complexity
to
the
flavor
profile
not
sure
a
la
bunnyhop
that
i
experienced
all
of
this
but
still
found
firestone
pa
to
be
a
gentle
tasty
session
pale
ale
nonetheless
would
happily
drink
this
again
light

this
tasty
offering
pours
forth
a
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
giving
way
to
a
thinner
lace
the
aroma
is
decidedly
malty
with
strong
caramel
tones
and
subtle
hints
of
roast
and
chocolate
the
initial
flavor
is
of
a
quick
malt
pushed
aside
by
a
light
floral
hop
spice
toffee
and
mellow
chocolate
notes
flow
through
and
finish
everything
off
nicely
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
copperorange
creamy
white
thick
head
i
think
it
had
some
kind
of
reaction
with
the
prior
beer
from
the
glass
because
it
was
the
thickest
head
i
had
ever
seen
without
dropping
the
bottle
before
opening
anyway
i
let
it
rest
and
it
eventually
dissipated
to
a
reasonable
level
but
not
completely
i
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
hops
are
evident
too
bitter
for
some
but
probably
not
bitter
enough
for
a
hophead
because
there
is
a
definite
malt
character
if
its
side
by
side
with
snpa
ill
take
the
firestone
every
time
this
beer
pours
a
clear
slight
reddishh
golden
color

a

offwhite
head
the
mouthfeel
is

the

hops
fuggles
cascade
centennial

chinook
a
nice
beer
i
like
the
hops
and
bitterness
but
it
may
be
a
bit
onedimensional
for
some
nonhopheads
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
golden
copper
color
and
almost
no
head
not
much
aroma
to
wet
your
appetite
and
has
what
i
think
is
a
hint
of
vanilla
i
may
well
be
wrong
on
that
good
mouthfeel
and
imo
could
use
a
little
more
hops
and
also
alcohol
kick
but
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
well

really
nice
beer
this
was
my
first
hill
farmstead
beer
maybe
i
was
expecting
unicorns
with
rainbows
shooting
out
of
them
but
this
didnt
totally
blow
me
away
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
did
not
overwhelm
me
amazingly
flavorful
for
the
abv
sessionable
and
satisfying
on
tap
at
the
worthy
burger
despite
living
in
neighboring
nh
ive
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
this
a
cloudy
pumpkin
pour
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
died
down
quickly
but
left
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
an
almost
smokey
hoppiness
on
the
nose
big
herbal
fruity
hop
flavor
how
did
they
pack
all
that
in
an
pale
ale
a
strong
bitter
pop
especially
late
the
carbonation
seems
right
on
and
there
is
a
creaminess
to
this
one
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
often
forgot
i
wasnt
drinking
an
ipa
because
it
left
me
wanting
nothing
more
like
some
apas
can
with
the
possible
exception
of
zombie
dust
boy
would
i
love
to
test
them
sidebyside
this
is
easily
the
best
apa
ive
tasted
edward
took
the
top
spot
for
apas
for
me
i
love
the
stoneface
and
peeper
but
have
to
put
this
higher
in
the
pecking
order
of
apas
i
feel
bad
had
this
after
an
abner
and
didnt
get
to
really
clean
out
my
taste
buds
before
this
one
at
a
low
5
with
the
flavor
you
get
outstanding
efb
just
has
the
magic
touch
but
like
all
their
brews
just
so
hard
to
get
your
hands
on
which
in
my
opinion
goes
to
my
sense
of
feel
hazy
opague
amber
orange
much
like
abner
and
similar
fruitiness
but
with
a
much
much
lighter
mouthfeel
unlike
any
other
pale
ales
that
ive
had
and
very
very
very
crushable
and
enjoyable
nose
of
any
and
all
citrus
fruits
particularly
orange
and
mango
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
as
its
so
light
in
texture
yet
rustic
and
flavorful
this
is
a
all
day
on
a
boat
in
the
hot
sun
kind
of
beer
at
5
2
and
one
of
the
best
pales
ive
ever
had
id
put
the
fort
point
pales
from
trillium
ahead
of
this
but
otherwise
its
right
up
there
nice
smooth
taste
hint
of
fruit
not
too
much
similar
to
a
tired
hands
brew
o
this
is
one
kick
ass
pale
ale
probably
the
best
i
have
ever
had
there
is
a
reason
this
is
the
grandaddy
of
hf
it
is
deserving
everything
you
want
in
a
pale
ale
and
even
more
this
beer
is
a
thing
of
beauty
awesome
it
was
kind
of
flat
that
day
a
little
too
hazy
for
a
pale
and
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
for
a
pale
but
a
great
beer
i
feel
like
i
would
have
given
a
higher
rating
if
this
was
classified
as
an
american
ipa
straight
up
orange
colored
beer
with
a
big
off
white
head
even
out
of
the
growler
aroma
is
like
a
floral
bouquet
with
light
citrus
and
pine
malts
hold
up
well
nice
delicate
mix
flavor
is
sweet
and
sharply
citrus
initially
twhen
turns
to
spicy
and
herbal
a
lot
of
deliciousness
to
take
in
texture
is
smooth
but
loaded
with
prickly
carbonation
subtle
dryness
and
slight
hop
resin
grittiness
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
a
growler
of
its
got
a
distinct
hill
farmstead
taste
to
it
very
fresh
hoppy
herbal
and
spicy
a
very
likable
beer
very
solid
beer
but
again
hill
farmstead
has
better
ones
at
three
penny
taproom
in
montpelier
this
is
the
standard
for
an
apa
growler

beautiful
color
with
firm
head
moderate
citrus
aroma
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
for
an
apa
enjoyed
immensely
on
tap
at
the
brewery
aromas
of
clean
grapefruit
citrus
pine
white
peach
full
growing

with
a
really
nice

is
really
full
with
a
moderate

of
it
in
my
glass
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
very
long
time
hill
farmstead
makes
absurdly
clean
beers
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
the
cleanest
which
really
shines
in
an
american
pale
ale
worth
the
drive
wow
super
drinkable
light
crisp
and
citrusy
superb
edward
is
just
about
the
perfect
pale

need
to
drink
more
of
it

drink
it
side
by
side
with
trillium
fort
point
and
zombie
dust
to
say
which
one
i
like
the
best
but
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
any
of
those
three
apas
if
you
can
get
some
of
this
please
do
so
i
cant
imagine
you
would
be
disappointed
absolutely
delicious
smooth
smells
great
tastes
better
worth
the
wait
o
really
enjoyed
the
refreshing
nature
of
the
citrus
and
light
feel
which
accompanied
by
the
5
2
abv
provides
a
great
experience
beyond
that
first
beer
just
awesome
this
pale
ale
is
no
doubt
world
class
smooth
and
balanced
a
great
start
to
those
who
are
looking

piney
and
full
of

thx
to
k0iz
for
the
pickup
o
easily
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
ive
had
it
has
more
hop
flavor
than
most
ipas
but
with
a
great
balance
of
bitterness
and
malt
it
is
a
lot
more
dry
than
it
is
sweet
but
i
think
its
a
perfect
balance
of
sugar
crazy
good
crisp
finish
with
a
really
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
ostrong
showing
here
easy
to
see
why
this
breweries
beers
are
in
such
high
demand
overall
this
is
almost
like
pseudosue
with
a
more
prodominent
peachy

as
expected
edward
is
an
excellent
hoppy
beer
brewed
by

great
beer

to
try
more
from
this
brewery
big
slightly
off

provides
ample

sticks
big
citrus
orange
grapefruit
and
pine
in
the
nose
taste
follows
with
citrus
mainly
orange
and
a
piney
resinous
finish
that
is
quite
bitter
for
a
pale
ale
slick
mouthfeel
coats
the
palate
then
in
a
flash
goes
away
clean
with
a
drying
bitter
finish
ipa
like
medium
body
is
nice
overall
an
amazing
pale
ale
that
delivers
ipa
mouthfeel
and
big
flavor
pours
a
nice
yellow
pale
color
it
is
a
bit
cloudy
doesnt
have
much
foam
although
a
head
was
formed
but
dissipated
quickly
aroma
is
of
distinct
hops
taste
is
hoppy
great
for
those
that
are
not
looking
for
a
piney
ipa
this
growler
tasted
a
bit
watery
mouth
feel
is
light
he
pour
is
a
reddish
orange
gold
with
a
thinner
white
head
that
leaves
a
beautiful
lace
on
the
brewery
tulip
the
aroma
is
incredible
citrusy
hops
with
a
grapefruit
character
and
a
tropical
fruitiness
to
it
maybe
a
light
piny
sensation
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
so
similar
the
hoppiness
is
heavy
but
there
isnt
a
overbearing
bitterness
the
fruitiness
and
light
sweetness
at
the
end
is
delightful
the
mouth
feel
is
almost
perfect
and
the
dryness
at
the
end
is
outstanding
for
an
apa
not
sure
why
this
is
considered
a
pale
ale
so
darn
hoppy
it
really
should
be
an
ipa
but
really
that
doesnt
matter
what
does
matter
is
this
beers
awesomeness
taste
is
out
of
this
world
fruity
with
notes
of
mango
citrus
and
even
some
strawberry
piney
bitter
and
dank
as
well
and
so
drinkable
its
scary
try
this
stuff

what
an

tastes
like
a
westcoast
ipa
hill
farmstead
is
totally
living
up
to
the
hype
hops
o
great
as
a
top
flight
american
pale
ale
or
dipa
deliciously
citrusy
with
85
ibus
to
let
you
know
it
means
business
a
new
favorite
for
sure
another
reaffirmation
that
it
was
worth
all
the
extra
driving
3
hours
round
trip
from
waitsfield
and
line
standing
an
hour
and
a
quarter
which
i
understand
is
about
half
of
normal
for
a
saturday
and
money

5
75

liters
or
about
5
50
per
12
ounces
including
19
for

to
get
hill
farmstead
brews
edwards
relatively
low
abv
could
make
it
the
best
session
pale
ale
in
existence
poured
the
color
of
grapefruit
juice
golden
hazy
and
with
a
slight
orange
blush
on
it
fat
creamy
head
of
white
foam
that
lasted
well
and
left
lace
this
beer
smells
floral
and
fruity
lovely
light
citrus
pineapple
and
mango
for
intense
sweetness
earthy
pine
that
is
not
heavy
and
does
not
stand
out
past
the
other
scents
the
malt
on
this
nose
is
a
light
sweet
perfume
so
wonderful
how
all
hills
beer
has
this
quality
of
lightness
both
in
the
nose
and
in
the
drink
i
think
if
i
had
to
summarize
hills
trademark
as
a
brewer
i
would
do
it
like
this
he
is
trying
to
put
the
hops
in
the
beer
and
leave
them
on
the
vine
at
the
same
time
he
has
a
way
with
hops
and
in
this
beer
they
are
so
fruity
and
yet
so
light
on
the
palate
thats
his
other
trademark
the
light
malt
that
is
so
light
its
like
the
beer
wants
to
just
float
out
of
the
glass
crisp
light
sweetness
like
a
floral
nectar
a
bit
of
light
sweet
cracker
that
has
exactly
the
perfect
balance
the
beer
has
a
resonance
rather
than
an
aftertaste
and
its
light
floral
and
fruitiness
as
the
beer
warms
some
sweet
grass
and
pine
comes
forward
and
this
is
just
a
lovely
beer
notes
bottled
on
4914
and
drank
on
the
suggest
serve
by
date
of
41714
served
from
a
2l
hf
growler
o
very
drinkable
with
subtle
flavors
and
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malt
that
being
said
there
are
probably
half
a
dozen
beers
as
good
as
this
that
i
could
buy
off
the
shelf
or
trade
for
much
more
easily
o
just
another
hit
via
the
genius
that
is
hill
farmstead
fresh
from
the
growler
filled
today
always
get
edward
whenever
i
can
on
tap
in
vt
have
never
gotten
a
growler
to
bring
home
always
overlook
it
because
of
the
great
double
ipas
poured
in
my
hf
tulip
murky
bright
gold
nice
two
finger
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
great
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
so
fresh
juicy
citrus
mostly
small
amount
of
grassy
pine
the
taste
is
very
crisp
lots
of
orange
flavor
upfront
very
light
and
refreshing
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
but
not
huge
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
oedward
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
who
am
i
kidding
anything
those
guys
do
up
on
the
farm
is
unbelievable
a
wonderful
beer
though
a
bit
overshadowed
by
other
hill
farmstead
brews
ooverall
an
awesome
apa
a
must
get
the
first
hill
farmstead
beer
ive
tried
am
looking
forward
to
many
more
extremely
flavorful
and
hoppy
pale
ale
great
golden
pale
color
fantastic
hop
aroma
of
citrus
has
a
better
hop
profile
than
most
generic
ipas
on
the
market
if
i
had
to
choose
one
beer
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
think
edward
would
be
it
revisited
on
tap
multiple
times
on
my
recent
vermont
pilgrimage
during
the
week
of
2112014
new
thoughts
on
this
beer
having
had
multiple
of
highly
acclaimed
american
pale
ales
such
as
zombie
dust
pseudosue
etc
and
having
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
this
at
least
8
times
since
the
first
growler
i
split
back
in
september
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
so
complex
that
each
time
i
taste
it
theres
something
different
that
stands
out
that
was
previously
in
the
background
it
has
citrus
passion
fruit
mango
floral
pine
hop
characters
in
there
most
of
the
time
citrus
and
passion
fruit
stands
out
but
other
times
the
floral
and
pine
stands
out
it
just
seems
to
depend
on
how
youre
feeling
that
day
and
either
way
the
delicious
malt
backbone
provides
just
enough
sweetness
along
with
the
fantastic
hf
mouthfeel
to
make
drinking
this
a
real
treat
its
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
is
flavourful
and
almost
juicy
and
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
no
matter
where
i
am
in
my
day
or
my
life
its
by
far
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
more
or
less
perfect
growler
nose
is
stronger
citrus
orange
and
peach
taste
also
has
more
hops
some
citrus
and
some
fresh
fruity
green
notes
still
well
balanced
grain
clean
and
fresh
bitterness
is
a
touch
less
than
i
remember
real
orangey
seriously
it
smells
like
someone
peeled
a
clementine
but
no
its
just
this
beer
sweet
orange
aromas
great
light
mouthfeel
with
enough
body
to
keep
it
interesting
but
not
get
heavy
after
drinking
a
pint
of
it
i
dont
know
if
i
could
only
drink
this
beer
for
eternity
theres
no
pine
or
resin
to
kick
me
in
the
teeth
but
for
a
night
a
week
i
could
really
dig
this
in
the
springtime
sun
serving
type
growler
this
is
a
colorful
apa
that
does
great
justice
to
an
oft
overlooked
style
about
as
perfect
as
a
beer
can
be
in
my
eyes
such
a
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
pale
ale
refreshing
and
easy
if
i
had
to
pick
one
beer
to
have
forever
just
so
incredibly
drinkable
great
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
beside
the
heady
once
i
went
to
waterbury
vermont
this
beer
fills
your
mouth
with
a
nice
hoppy
taste
tasted
very
very
fresh
hill
farmstead
mastered
brewing
beers
this
beer
is
right
on
point
i
believe
its
a
american
pale
ale
but
it
punches
you
in
the
face
like
a
double
ipa
what
more
can
be
said
and
quite
frankly
droning
on
for
more
than
140
characters
in
this
day
and
age
is
droll
unreal
smell
wants
to
be
an
ipa
bitter
aftertaste
great
to
look
at
day
old
growler
2l
is
just
enough
for
my
wife
and
i
to
share
on
a
cold
new
england
fall
night
pours
a
light
orangy
color
hazy
and
with
a
modest
creamy
head
the
smell
is
citrusy
hops
not
overpowering
but
solid
and
nice
the
taste
follows
suit
citrus
hoppiness
a
touch
of
malt
but
then
the
hops
turn
up
at
the
end
with
a
parting
shot
of
orange
peel
goodness
mouthfeel
is
magical
god
i
wish
i
knew
how
hf
creates
the
silky
smooth
body
that
they
do
even
in
this
very
low
abv
apa
overall
a
very
solid
apa
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
i
love
the
5
2
abv
of
this
brew
so
drinkable
85
ibus
are
a
lot
for
an
apa
but
the
malts
hold
their
own
excellent
wish
there
was
better
access
to
more
of
the
hill
farmstead
products
o
best
apa
i
have
tried
surprised
it
was
not
an
ipa
highly
recommended
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
scentbut
interesting
in
its
own
ways
it
begins
somewhat
thin
but
rounds
out
nicely
developing
to
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
initially
a
nondescript
bitterness
that
gives
midway
through
to
the
bread
like
malt
flavor
finishes
with
an
agressive
hop
bitterness
a
little
disappointing
that
some
of
the
wonderful
scent
does
not
carry
through
as
well
into
the
flavor
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
o
very
mediocre
it
had
promise
based
on
the
smell
and
look
but
the
taste
is
so
underwhelming
onedimensional
that
i
am
completely
unable
to
understand
why
this
beer
is
more
wellrated
than
so
many
other
quality
beers
overall
edward
is
a
solid
beer
but
compared
to
other
hill
farmstead
offerings
what
is
enlightenment
the
single
hop
citra
grassroots
legitimacy
ipa
or
abner
just
to
name
a
few
that
i
enjoy
more
i
feel
that
edward
is
overrated

hazed
apricot

with
a
frothy
dense
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
heavy
lace
from
the
first
encounter
this
uniquely
flavorful
and
balanced
pale
really
showed
off
how
great
a
typically
simple
style
can
be
if
crafted
properly
lots
of
tropical
citrusy
hop
character
with
a
lovely
presence
softened
by
notes
of
herbal

the

edward
is
a
perfectly
crafted
beer
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
have
had
mostly
on
tap
at
farmhouse
tap
grill
few
other
places
might
have
it
in
burlington
this
is
the
best
american
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
hands
down
it
makes
me
think
of
a
cloistered
european
unfiltered
marzens
perfection
if
i
could
only
drink
one
american
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
i
really
just
cant
get
over
how
amazing
it
is
it
was
shockingly
good
on
the
first
sip
and
many
rounds
later
still
just
as
amazing
tap
at
the
moll
household
thanks
to

gorgeous

the
essential

sweet
cream
butter
going
on
in
the
nose
along
with
fresh
biscuit
oh
there
is
a
ton
of
dank
hops
but
the
malt
character
is
more
impressive
as
always
taste
is
very
quenching
soft
biscuity
sourdough
light
fruitiness
like
cantaloupe
and
peach
grassy
herbal
hops
come
to
balance
so
nice
to
have
a
zero
astringency
zero
abrasive
zero
specialty

stickiness
apa
hill

has
this
style
on
lockdown
and
should
write

nice

easy

apa
thank
doesnt
compromise
on
taste
had
it
with
the
boys
at
three
penny
pub
in
montpelier
served
in
a
narrow
hills
farmstead
glass
my
first
experience
with
hills
did
not
disappoint
it
was
one
ofif
not
the
best
pale
ales
that
ive
ever
tasted
reminded
me
of
maine
brewing
mo
which
is
a
great
thing
started
and
ended
smooth
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
o
im
beginning
to
understand
why
these
beers
are
rated
so
highly
however
i
cant
help
but
notice
that
while
everything
i
tried
on
this
recent
trip
has
been
delicious
it
has
also
been
relatively
one
dimensional
id
love
to
try
some
other
non
ipaapa
styles
overall
incredible
beer
that
even
though
its
called
american
pale
ale
might
actually
be
a
hybrid
of
apa
and
ipa
not
quite
hoppy
enough
to
be
an
ipa
but
in
my
own
opinion
not
quite
round
and
generous
enough
to
be
an
apa
still
im
glad
i
still
have
a
couple
glasses
of
this
where
that
came
from
ill
enjoy
every
last
drop
of
it
very
good
potentially
excellent
even
if
i
hadnt
been
so
spoiled
lately
o
not
the
super
juicy
tropical
nose
i
have
been
accustomed
with
hf
beers
it
could
be
entirely
possible
i
hold
hf
at
higher
level
bc
nose
is
very
very
good
juicy
hops
do
explode
in
mouth
little
more
piney
than
expected
from
a
pale
ale
it
does
come
close
buy
zd
still
holds
the
crown
o
very
impressed
great
session
beer
well
balanced
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
a
treat
very
well
done
easy
to
drink
loads
of
hop
flavor
without
a
ton
of
bitterness
great
malt
backing
very
drinkable
this
is
to
be
expected
from
hill
farmstead
having
had
it
recently
as
well
i
prefer
what
is
enlightenment
as
far
as
their
pale
ales
go
but
this
is
certainly
very
good
by
all
means
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
piney
the
taste
is
sweet
yet
very
bold
it
has
a
smooth
feel
that
hangs
around
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
beer
is
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
very
thick
white
head
this
beer
is
all
that
it
is
cracked
up
to
be
very
nice
this
guy
can
brew
o
delicious
edward
achieves
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
massive
hoppy
nose
and
an
enticing
appearance
ov
as
with
susan
this
is
a
very
solid
and
high
quality
beer
that
i
would
drink
regularly
if
i
was
able
to
do
so
however
this
beer
also
didnt
blow
my
mind
and
while
i
think
its
very
good
to
me
its
not
quite
world
class
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
m
medium
bodied
lingering
bitterness
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
explosion
on
the
nose
and
the
wonderfully
interwoven
realism
of
the
farms
wellwater
as
in
some
of
their
other
hoppy
beers
this
plays
an
integral
part
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavoring
giving
a
certain
genuine
brush
to
it
and
making
the
grain
and
oily
hoppiness
that
much
more
close
wholesome
and
real
the
hops
through
the
flavoring
here
were
insanely
flavorful
juicy
and
authentic
giving
the
illusion
that
one
was
literally
sucking
on
a
thin
slice
of
dripping
wet
grapefruit
again
this
mixed
with
the
exquisite
base
components
making
for
yet
another
memorable
thoughtful
and
deliberate
beer
with
true
character

smelling
huge

also
orange

a
little

theres
a
slight
amount

as
well
the
taste
is
almost
perfection
its
everything
i
want
a
pale
ale
to
be
the
malts
and
hops
are
completely
balanced
with
an
unrivaled
lingering
finish
the
pale
malt
is
wonderful
all
the
citrus
is
still
there
as
it
was
on
the
nose
and
the
fruity
citrusy
hops
are
just
enough
without
going
too
far
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
and
it
the
head
is
retained
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of

it
would
be
tough

loads

another
winner
from
this
brewer
i
would
certainly
put
this
beer
up
there
amongst
the
worlds
best
apas
not
the
prototype
of
a
pliny

close
and
a
pleasant

from

a
fruity

strong
citrus
notes
flavor
started
off
with
a
hoppy
flavor
but
sweet
hops
with
a
bit
of
a
orangy
profile
felt
great
in
the
mouth
just
a
bit
of
cling
to
the
insides
a
tad
too
much
kick
on
the
tongue
for
my
liking
overall
a
great
beer
easily
accessible
for
most
people
but
refined
enough
to
enthusiasts
to
enjoy

i
mean
what
more
can
you
do
to
a
pale
ale
this
destroys
zombie
dust
in
my
mind
wow
is
this
good
it
pours
a
glorious
hazy
orange
color
with
an
inch
of
cool
whip
looking
head
the
nose
is
amazing
pine
and
lemon
and
grapefruit
intensely
hopped
but
freakishly
drinkable
the
malts
provide
just
enough
backbone
and
the
yeast
that
was
used
clearly
fermented
every
last
sugar
in
this
thing
its
dry
and
clean
and
bitter
and
superbly
well
carbonated
and
somehow
very
light
and
sessionable
despite
its
packed
in
flavor
this
is
a
beer
drinkers
pale
ale
brilliantly
hopped
literally
like
nothing
else
ive
ever
encountered
the
craftsmanship
here
is
unrivaled
what
was
missing
in
the
hill
farmstead
saisons
is
captured
here
i
desire
no
more
in
a
pale
ale
and
i
think
that
i
have
found
the
one
i
am
made
to
drink
like
when
i
saw
buddy
guy
play
guitar
for
the
first
time
i
knew
talent
and
showmanship
had
reached
their
pinnacle
this
is
that
same
peak
in
an
american
pale
ale
it
is
not
equaled
by
any
ive
ever
had
and
i
doubt
if
it
will
be
world
class
and
then
some
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
sessioning
hoppy
beers
verdict
a
very
nice
pale
ale
from
hill
farmstead
quite
drinkable
nice
hop
profile
without
being
an
aggressively
hopped
and
bitter
pale
ale
its
not
in
the
same
league
as
what
is
enlightenment
but
this
is
a
fine
ale
that
i
would
love
to
drink
regularly
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
up
there
with
zombie
dust
and
blue
lobsters
gold
claw
o
my
favorite
pale
ale
hill
farmstead
is
my
favorite
brewery
for
a
reason
and
its
no
surprise
that
their
standard
brew
hits
all
the
right
notes
edward
is
simply
a
classic
big
citrus
aroma
of
tangerine
and
grapefruit
citric
with
a
green
undercurrent
bitter
grapefruit
pith
and
resiny
pine
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
light
carb
level
my
personal
jury
is
still
out
if
this
is
any
better
than
zombie
dust
flavour
packed
and
satisfying
pale
ale
but
for
my
palate
it
pushes
the
bitterness
to
the
point
that
drinkability
is
slightly
impaired
overall
it
took
me
two
glasses
to
really
appreciate
the
majesty
of
this
beer
its
everything
i
want
in
a
pale
ale
and
just
about
perfect
overall
hill
farmstead
never
disappoints
this
is
a
great
spring
and
summer
brew
refreshing
and
light
for
its
style
cheers
on
tap
at
farmhouse
tap
and
grill
pours
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
maybe
tangerine
the
taste
is
bitter
apricots
with
nice
tropical
fruits
grapefruit
notes
as
well
nice
bitterness
with
a
good
amount
of
fruity
hop
flavor
dry
and
resinous
this
is
a
pale
ale
with
a
lot
of
fruity
and
hoppy
that
rivals
most
ipas
overall
its
bitter
hoppy
and
drinkable
glad
i
got
to
try
it
fantastic
pale
ale
worth
seeking
out
od
a
pretty
nice
pale
ale
seems
pretty
heavy
with
that
bright
lovley
fresh
citrus
flavour
and
its
really
thirst
quenching
and
complex
really
well
made
to
the
point
and
tasty
very
drinkable
too
a
good
one
overall
a
great
version
of
hopforward
pale
ale
the
piney
hop
flavor
is
very
dominant
and
surprisingly
strong
for
such
a
light
ale
a
great
session
ale
for
hoplovers
o
a
nice
citrusytropical
pale
goes
down
so
easy
amazing
beer
experiences
like
this
are
what
its
all
about
o
very
nice
pale
now
that
ive
had
a
good
amount
of
hf
hoppy
stuff
this
is
definitely
up
there
once
again
palesipas
have
always
been
a
summer
thing
to
me
and
this
is
another
one
i
could
drink
all
summer
way
too
kill
it
again
shaun
o
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
flavor
was
a
bit
onenote
and
the
harsh
bitterness
in
the
finish
really
hurts
drinkability
i
cant
really
imagine
that
id
want
to
drink
more
than
a
single
pint
of
this
smells
lovely
though
i
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
hop
and
vine
in
portland
oregon
they
did
a
beer
exchange
with
some
vermont
breweries
and
got
like
20
different
beers
i
had
edward
in
a
12
oz
glass
and
i
must
say
it
was
very
smooth
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
hops
yet
was
not
at
all
overpowering
there
was
a
little
foam
when
poured
but
that
quickly
dissipated
it
poured
a
nice
light
orange
color
and
smelled
very
nice
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
and
several
shades
darker
than
society
and
solitude
6
i
just
reviewed
that
beer
and
that
is
why
i
am
comparing
them
in
color
the
beer
also
pours
with
a
big
rocky
egg
shell
white
head
of
varying
sized
bubbles
which
leaves
sticky
fat
strings
on
the
glass
as
it
mellows
into
a
fingers
width
head
in
body
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
haze
like
most
hoppy
beers
from
hill
farmstead
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
juicy
citrus
hops
with
touches
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
solid
backbone
of
pine
the
malt
is
present
as
a
light
spicy
bread
and
sweet
caramel
that
melds
nicely
with
the
hill
farmstead
ale
yeasts
breadiness
this
is
a
nice
smell
that
highlights
the
hops
while
still
giving
a
good
light
malt
character
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bitter
sweet
with
a
slight
acidity
from
the
hops
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
juicy
hops
featuring
sweet
orange
and
tangerine
flavors
with
touches
of
tropical
fruit
before
it
blossoms
into
grapefruit
bitter
pine
and
then
aspirin
flavors
that
properly
bite
beneath
the
bitters
rise
a
nice
malt
character
that
is
slightly
caramelly
and
mellow
it
also
features
a
slight
spice
grain
flavor
the
finish
is
surprisingly
long
and
returns
to
the
beginnings
juicy
hop
flavors
only
now
with
a
solid
cereal
caramel
flavor
that
is
mellow
and
warming
on
the
throat
the
aftertaste
brings
the
bitters
back
to
the
tongue
with
lingering
whiffs
of
cereal
malts
in
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
medium
light
and
creamy
in
body
with
a
beautiful
fluffy
carbonation
that
im
coming
to
expect
from
hill
farmstead
the
mouth
is
left
bitterdry
but
wet
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
from
the
hop
acids
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
of
those
i
have
tried
mo
from
the
maine
beer
company
is
a
little
behind
it
though
i
think
mo
had
a
better
nose
but
this
beer
handles
its
bitters
beautifully
and
melds
them
into
the
malts
so
that
each
has
its
turn
to
shine
on
the
palate
its
taste
definitely
surpasses
mo
and
that
is
where
it
counts
this
is
another
beautiful
beer
from
hill
farmstead
try
this
beer
hill
farmsteads
flagship
for
good
reason
i
could
drink
this
all
day
most
definitely
a
top
notch
ale
made
with
a
thoughtful
selection
of
hops
ale
malt
and
well
water
from
the
hill
farm
very
inviting
and
for
those
that
appreciate
a
moderate
amount
of
bitterness
it
is
a
great
choice
those
expecting
a
wallop
to
the
palate
might
feel
let
down
on
that
front
but
there
is
no
denying
the
quality
and
the
high
level
of
craft
to
produce
this
complex
and
delicious
vermont
ale
o
probably
not
a
fair
review
of
this
beer
growler
is
3
weeks
old
but
not
sure
if
i
will
ever
get
to
try
it
again
surprised
how
much
head
it
still
poured
but
i
think
the
aroma
and
taste
suffered
from
the
age
the
smell
isnt
too
overwhelming
however
i
can
pick
up
on
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
with
grapefruit
and
subtle
lemon
and
orange
reminds
me
of
a
toned
down
galaxy
i
would
say
more
prominent
citrus
notes
and
a
bit
of
subtle
tropical
fruit
in
the
background
the
hops
are
lightly
floral
but
still
very
juicy
and
i
can
still
get
some
risinous
tastes
but
not
too
overwhelming
taste
is
very
well
balanced
juicy
and
fruity
hops
come
at
you
with
grapefruit
tangerine
and
a
little
lemon
i
can
notice
the
malt
however
its
in
the
background
and
doesnt
take
away
from
the
hoppy
pa
nature
of
the
brew
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
is
the
key
for
this
pa
however
the
hops
are
certainly
brought
to
the
forefront
which
is
what
i
would
want
out
of
an
pa
of
this
nature
i
prefer
dipas
above
all
else
however
i
loved
this
hf
brew
and
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
anyone
dont
let
the
apa
style
fool
you
it
still
has
tons
of
excellent
hoppy
character
o
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
if
i
could
strays
away
from
the
in
your
face
imperial
approach
and
is
just
a
nice
medium
presentation
of
hops

the

the

expresses
citrus
and
floral
notes
slightly
grassy
and
delicate
with
some
biscuity
aromas
towards
the

taste
follows

however
more
of
an
earthygrassy
character
comes
out
in
the
flavor
profile
with
the
citrus
notes
lingering
lightly
and
some
hops
bittering
in
the
background
theres
also
a
trace
of
wet
cardboard
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
pleasant
palate
cleansing
carbonation
overall
an
immensely
quaffable
american
pale
ale
that
is
a
hallmark
of
the
style
in
my
humble
opinion
edward
was
a
nice
and
smooth
apa
i
even
bought
a
growler
of
it
and
a
bottle
of
florence
magnificent
beer
o
another
well
made
hoppy
beer
from
hill
they
really
know
how
to
do
these
beers
well
tons
of
hop
flavor
excellent
balance
smooth
and
easy
to
quaff
a
bunch
of
this
if
it
was
more
plentiful
this
would
probably
be
in
my
fridge
all
of
the
time
o
very
solid
pale
ale
good
hop
presence
good
balance
very
drinkable
i
had
this
beer
at
the
farmhouse
in
burlington
vt
it
is
a
local
favorite
and
every
time
i
visit
i
end
up
drinking
at
least
one
the
edward
tastes
more
like
a
ipa
with
low
abv
which
really
brings
out
the
character
of
the
hops
it
is
aromatic
delicious
and
you
should
get
it
if
you
have
the
chance
a
burlington
vt
classic
edward
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
the
glass
laced
this
beer
definitely
showcases
the
hops
the
aroma
is
of
pine
and
grapefruit
the
flavor
is
goes
along
and
one
gets
the
citrus
first
followed
by
the
piney
essences
there
is
almost
a
resiny
flavor
from
the
hops
the
bitterness
lingers
for
a
little
bit
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
before
fading
away
slowly
this
beer
is
light
and
mildly
bubbly
leaving
just
a
hint
of
stickiness
after
the
swallow
overall
edward
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
on
the
hoppier
end
of
the
spectrum
owhat
an
apa
not
as
good
as
zombie
dust
but
great
none
the
less
the
balance
is
great
i
rated
this
beer
pretty
high
because
its
good
more
so
because
its
good
and
my
wife
likes
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
bone
white
head
that
persists
forever
wow
that
aroma
has
got
lots
of
hops
in
it
for
a
pale
ale
juicy
citrus
and
pine
with
a
hint
of
green
onion
and
a
touch
of
bready
malt
make
for
a
wonderful
smelling
beer
the
flavor
is
loaded
with
pine
and
citrus
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
to
back
it
up
flavorful
bitterness
but
never
harsh
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bready
resinous
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
little
beer
that
at
times
feel
more
like
and
ipa
but
its
so
damn
good
im
not
going
to
quibble
of
stylistic
designations
o
4
5
a
flavorful
pale
ale
that
drinks
like
an
ipa
without
the
higher
abv
hits
the
spot
nicely
executed
something
is
familiar
between
the
three
hoppy
hf
beers
ive
tried
but
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
im
not
sure
if
its
the
malt
the
water
my
guess
or
a
particular
hop
i
dont
think
this
is
it
but
the
three
hf
beers
all
have
a
similar
taste
that
i
really
like
and
isnt
like
many
other
beers
its
very
slight
but
since
hf
beers
are
few
and
far
between
for
me
im
really
taking
the
time
to
analyze
each
one
im
interested
to
see
if
this
carries
over
into
the
saisons
that
are
next
up
o
most
excellent
o
my
first
and
certainly
not
last
beer
from
hill
farmstead
as
i
can
already
tell
the
hype
is
real
a
nearly
perfect
version
of
the
style
and
a
great
utilization
of
all
the
characteristics
of
hops
that
beer
lovers
cherish
you
can
taste
all
the
ingredients
and
differentiate
them
as
unique
to
this
brewery
incredible
stuff
a
very
solid
pale
ale
pales
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
hf
hoppy
offerings
but
still
a
pale
ale
id
be
glad
to
order
anytime
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
with
smooth
but
clean
carbonation
elegant
and
totally
drinkable
one
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
a
perfect
candidate
for
a
session
american
style
not
as
exciting
as
the
hf
ipas
perhaps
but
more
of
an
everyday
drinker
to
be
sure
o
an
amazing
pale
ale
loads
of
hoppy
citrus
goodness
excellent
all
the
way
through
awesome
right
where
modern
pale
ales
should
be
hoppy
but
balanced
nicely
by
malt
and
yeast
would
probably
buy
a
12pack
of
this
biweekly
if
i
could
i
can
dream
overall
an
amazing
apa
that
sets
the
standard
as
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
goto
beer
update
reading
more
reviews
it
sounds
like
i
would
really
like
zombie

ill
ask
three

if
they
can
get
some
of
that
o
russian
rivers
row
2
alpines
hoppy
birthday
and
three
floyds
zombie
dust
are
probably
the
most
popular
pale
ales
on
ba
right
now
this
and
hill
farmsteads
citra
should
be
in
the
conversation
as
well
superlative
for
the
style
i
feel
almost
like
a
broken
record
saying
how
good
hill
farmsteads
hoppy
beers
are
but
when
its
true
o
most
excellent
beer
looks
like
a
homebrew
poured
from

into
tall

a

real

perhaps
not

drawn
to
it
but
its
quite
a
unique
pale

by
these

and
a

edward
is
a
superior
american
pale
ale
its
delicious
aroma
its
exceptionally
wellbalanced
fruity
hop
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
and
its
outofthisworld

make
it
a
true
standout
among
not
only
beers
of
its
style
category
but
among
all
the
beers
in
the
wide
world
of
beerdom
now
edward
may
not
be
the
most
unusual
or
soughtafter
of
shaun
hills
fermented
creations
but
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
best
and
makes
a
great
introduction
to
his
other
beers
bravo
hill
farmstead
o
this
was
a
very
nice
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorites
the
only
one
i
would
say
is
maybe
a
little
bit
better
that
ive
had
is
row
2hill
56
has
a
very
nice
hop
taste
for
a
pale
ale
and
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
citrus
hops
and
caramelpale
malts
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
definitely
recommend
trying
it
if
you
get
the
chance
a
very
good
apa
about
on
par
with
daisy
cutter
in
my
book
zombie
dust
still
reigns
supreme
i
love
being
surprised
by
an
apa
brewers
in
the
us
have
mastered
the
style
and
even
the
efforts
from
mediocre
breweries
are
usually
nice
enough
hill
farmsteads
edward
focuses
on
freshness
to
make
a
quenching
apa
with
very
little
of
the
resinous
bitterness
that
sometimes
blurs
the
lines
between
this
style
and
aipas

awesome

i
thought
it
was
very
robust
for
an
ipa
before
i
read
the
menu
and
found
out
it
was
an
apa
in
the
end
i
felt
the
beer
to
be
a
really
subtle
affair
unique
and
immensely
satisfying
it
rewards
careful
attention
yet
also
hits
the
spot
if
you
just
need
a
good
soulsatisfying
pale
alethe
hallmark
of
a
great
beer
this
is
a
med
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
worth
checkin
out
i
would
have
this
again
if
presented
with
the
opportunity
had
this
at
the
blue
dog
and
was
quite
good
m
light
to
medium
body
a
touch
water
at
times
but
some
good
hop
stickiness
helped
to
bring
up
the
mouth
feel
light
carbonation
o
i
could
drink
this
all
day
another
excellent
beer
from
hill
farmstead
am
i
surprised
no
and
thats
a
great
thing
o
good
but
for
my
preference
its
overly
bitter
with
no
sweetness
as
a
counterpoint
that
being
said
i
did
enjoy
it
would
have
it
again
taste
continues
the
tangerine
presence
for
me
an
initial
sweetness
which
promptly
cedes
the
baton
to
the
juicy
fruitiness
closes
with
a
sedate
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
pine
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
good
another
thirstquenching
brew
here
from
hill
farmstead
d
excellent
american
pale
ale
im
convinced
that
the
folks
at
hill
farmstead
are
amongst
the
top
brewers
in
the
entire
world
exceptional
flavor
and
depth
all
weighing
in
at
5
2
abv
i
was
impressed
with
the
depth
of
the
hop
profile
and
how
damn
balanced
this
is
a
good
sturdy
apa
without
the
sticky
caramel
of
others
in
the
style
i
didnt
even
know
what
type
of
beer
edward
was
when
i
seen
it
i
seen
hill
famstead
and
assumed
it
was
an
ipa
i
was
surprised
after
the
first
sip
just
how
bready
and
crisp
this
bad
boy
was
very
impressive
style
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
there
is
a
medium
body
to
this
beer
that
seems
to
glide
through
your
palate
a
well
made
beer
considering
my
evening
consisted
of
enjoying
a
fresh
growler
of
this
beer
while
alternatively
having
my
week
old
twins
asleep
on
my
lap
id
say
life
is
pretty
good
cost
7
for
a
750
ml
growler
or
15
for
a
2
liter
growler
plus
the
deposit
a
very
nice
straightforward
classic
incredibly
drinkable
pale
ale
overall
a
truly
exceptional
beer
and
with
a
fresh
keg
like
this
holy
shit
drinkable
beyond
belief
delicious
an
american
treasure
i
could
session
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
pause
every
couple
minutes
just
to
say
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
and
very
cloudy
apricot
orange
in
color
with
a
one
finger
soapy
head
the
nose
is
essentially
clean
citrusy
hops
through
and
through
there
is
orange
and
tangerine
everywhere
its
citrusy
chaos
haha
the
flavors
too
are
100
citrusy
hops
i
cant
get
away
from
minute
maid
its
hard
really
hard
to
pick
out
anything
else
so
i
cant
say
the
nose
or
flavors
are
incredibly
complex
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
moderately
dry
it
has
nice
flavor
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
it
is
just
that
its
an
all
out
orange
assault
on
your
senses
without
much
depth
this
is
a
fantasticly
well
balanced
beer
not
too
hoppy
not
too
malty

easy

drink

i
just
wish
you
could
get
this
easier
in
bottles
also
but
since
that
probably
isnt
going
to
happen
ill
have
to
enjoy
it
on
tap
when
i
see
it
around
town
this
was
my
first
hill
farmstead
beer
and
i
want
to
try
them
all
now
if
this
is
any
indication
of
how
they
brew
i
want
more
now
o
just
a
fantastic
pale
ale
if
you
were
to
make
zombie
dust
more
bitter
and
flavorful
you
would
end
up
with
edward
very
similar
notes
and
flavors
just
a
bit
more
pronounced
absolutely
wonderful
easily
my
favorite
pale
ale
ive
tried
to
date
this
had
a
wonderful
mouth
feel
and
the
flavors
were
so
prominent
citrusy
and
juicy
which
is
just
what
i
like
great
stuff
once
again
from
hill
farmstead
overall
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
bar
none
simple
fresh
hoppy
and
really
flavorful
easy
to
drink
and
complex
i
have
had
this
four
or
five
times
without
reviewing
it
and
every
time
i
enjoy
it
immensely
definitely
deserving
of
its
reputation
o
unbelievable
pale
ale
from
hill
farmstead
the
bitter
and
sweet
flavors
of
citrus
and
pine
made
this
one
heck
of
a
brew
now
i
see
what
all
the
excitement
is
about
for

than
a
standard
pale
regardless
its
delicious
hoppy
and
bitter
excellent
take
on
the
style
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
want
to
see
it
everywhere
and
drink
it
all
the
time
o
wow
this
is
my
first
hill
farmstead
after
the
february
18th
2012
release
and
its
amazing
absolutely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
a
overall
a
superior
hop
forward
apa
really
solid
pale
ale
nice
balance
4
on
tap
cloudy
pinkish
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
huge
and
hoppy
with
grapefruit
dominant
a
little
pine
and
not
much
maltiness
amazing
flavor
hop
forward
with
enormous
grapefruit
really
intense
some
pine
and
just
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
big
resinous
hoppy
palate
with
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
great
overall
if
this
was
readily
available
this
would
be
my
goto
pale
ale
it
raises
the
bar
for
the
style
o
enjoyable
to
smell
enjoyable
to
taste
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
pale
it
has
great
aroma
bitterness
and
taste
while
staying
unbelievably
drinkable
this
one
gets
an
a
well
done
shaun
hill
o
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
maybe
my
favorite
beer
ever
with
this
amount
of
flavor
and
hop
aroma
at
5
2
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
haunts
my
dreams
o
a
great
brew
close
to
flower
power
but
doesnt
drink
quite
as
fresh
or
bright
still
awesome
one
of
the
best
tasting
pale
ales
i
have
had
like
an
ipa
with
no
detectable
alcohol
flavor
i
thought
the
beer
could
use
some
more
carbonation
but
it
wasnt
a
big
deal
great
complex
flavors
and
very
nicely
balanced
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
o
has
overtaken
zombie
dust
as
my
favorite
pale
ale
this
brewery
is
really
making
me
take
notice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
and
a
fantastic
apa
at
5
2
it
still
had
enough
hoppy
flavors
to
match
or
beat
a
lot
of
dipas
extremely
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
for
the
style
and
abv
just
a
great
beer
overall
o
this
may
be
my
second
favorite
pale
ale
behind
zombie
dust
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
for
being
just
over
5
i
could
have
easily
drank
the
whole
growler
myself
o
goes
down
easy
quite
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
the
flavors
on
the
palate
are
enjoyable
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
nose
would
suggest
while
present
in
copious
amounts
the
hop
flavor
seems
slightly
dulled
and
dare
i
say
a
little
oxidized
as
with
the
nose
the
flavor
leans
heavily
on
the
fruity
hops
mango
clementines
and
grapefruit
lend
plenty
of
flavor
and
the
bitterness
is
low
the
cascade
dry
hop
character
is
particularly
noticeable
the
malt
character
is
clean
crackerlike
mildly
doughy
and
unobtrusive
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
hop
flavor
particularly
the
citrus
and
a
mildly
resiny
and
gorgeous
bitterness
light
in
body
with
soft
gentle
carbonation
thats
perfect
for
the
style
this
beer
is
extremely
enjoyable
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
have
a
feeling
this
batch
is
just
a
touch
old
easily
one
of
the
best
east
coast
pale
ales
ive
had
as
of
late
ridiculously
fruity
nose
of
pineapple
grapefruit
and
passion
fruit
initially
thought
there
were
galaxy
hops
involved
but
the
profile
on
the
hill
farmstead
site
claims
otherwise
tastes
similar
to
a
citrusforward
ipa
ala
flower
power
but
the
5
2
abv
means
you
can
easily
drain
multiple
pints
without
wanting
to
fall
over
it
almost
feels
like
cheating
magnifique
this
beer
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazy
golden
copper
color
it
has
a
nice
finger
of
white
head
on
it
the
head
has
good
retention
and
it
leaves
behind
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
smells
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
there
are
some
tropical
fruit
aromas
here
as
well
as
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
has
a
nice
citrus
flavor
with
some
caramel
in
background
there
is
a
nice
hop
flavor
that
gives
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
pineapple
and
other
tropical
fruit
flavors
the
finish
leaves
some
fruit
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
lingering
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
here
with
some
nice
fruity
sweetness
that
gives
it
nice
balance
this
has
really
good
drinkability
i
would
have
no
problem
downing
a
bunch
of
glasses
of
this
throughout
an
evening
overall
i
think
it
is
a
really
nice
solid
pale
ale
the
hop
presence
is
really
nice
as
are
the
tropical
fruit
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
out
i
dont
think
youll
be
disappointed
o
great
smell
great
bitterness
and
taste
all
qualities
in
this
beer
you
would
expect
from
an
ipa
rather
than
a
pale
ale
so
smooth
and
so
drinkable
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
hf
had
st
the
good
life
arrived
super
cloudy
in
a
point
glass
los
unfiltered
and
peach
in
color
smells
like
classic
pale
ale
but
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
quite
nice
a
bit
grapefruit
flavored
nice
unfiltered
feel
medium
to
light
bodied
very
easy
drinker
why
yes
i
will
have
another
very
hoppy
and
strong
for
a
pale
ale
good
drinking
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
on
tap
at
armsby
abbey
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
moderate
creamy
white
head
smells
of
tropical
fruit
and
honey
not
heavy
on
pine
and
citrus
taste
is
clean
hoppy
goodness
with
just
enough
biscuit
to
balance
smooth
and
creamy
from
the
tap
wish
this
was
available
regularly
in
my
area
this
is
like
an
ipa
light
or
a
session
ipa
it
tastes
great
and
works
if
youre
looking
for
the
hf
hop
profile
without
a
stronger
beer
on
my
rare
chances
to
get
hf
beers
though
im
more
apt
to
try
something
bigger
this
beer
was
the
4th
and
last
to
run
out
at
the
caponesevent
m
clean
and
hoppy
edward
doesnt
skimp
on
the
hops
from
the
first
sniff
to
the
last
sip
i
was
in
love
too
bad
no
growler
fills
really
delicious
and
a
pretty
incredible
beer
given
the
abv
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
summer
staple
if
hill
farmstead
does
indeed
make
its
way
to
boston
pours
a
hazed
golden
orange
with
stiff
and
fluffy
cap
of
white
foam
long
lasting
and
great
lacing
scent
is
of
juicy
and
fruity
hops
with
grapefruit
tangerine
and
pineapple
the
stars
perfect
levels
of
biscuity
malt
sweetness
in
the
backbone
taste
follows
the
amazing
scent
fruity
and
juicy
full
flavored
this
is
a
pale
ale
stronger
than
many
ipas
without
being
overly
bitter
medium
bodied
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
great
carbonation
hands
down
the
best
pale
ale
on
the
market
a
great
intro
to
the
brewery
a
few
days
before
the
full
visit
overall
just
awesome
great
hops
nice
soft
smooth
malt
great
tropical
fruits
without
the
big
oily
resinous
kick
not
super
hoppy
or
super
bitter
and
malts
are
not
only
kept
in
check
but
have
a
really
nice
flavor
addition
with
that
silky
smooth
malt
kick
i
wish
i
knew
how
they
did
it
o
overall
this
was
insanely
good
so
juicy
and
tropical
to
quote
a
film
i
want
to
freeze
this
in
winter
and
skate
on
it
then
thaw
it
in
summer
and
drink
it
what
a
great
pale
ale
the
freshness
is
unreal
balance
flavor
and
feel
well
done
edward
pours
a
nearly
solid
opaque
orange
with
a
thin
bit
of
white
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
that
little
head
is
definitely
spunky
it
sticks
around
longer
than
i
would
have
expected
but
it
only
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
absolutely
wonderful
dank
with
grapefruit
pineapple
and
orange
aromas
forget
ipas
this
bad
boy
is
more
pungent
than
some
imperial
ipas
that
ive
had
theres
a
brief
flash
of
cracker
maltiness
at
the
front
of
each
sip
before
some
but
not
all
of
the
hoppy
goodness
hinted
at
by
aroma
is
delivered
theres
also
a
bit
of
an
off
aftertaste
that
i
usually
associate
with
simcoe
hops
that
lingers
for
a
second
after
each
sip
the
body
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
appropriate
for
the
style
yet
still
sturdy
enough
not
to
be
completely
overrun
by
the
hops
the
carbonation
is
just
a
little
off
though
the
beer
falls
dull
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
back
of
my
palate
still
though
edward
is
one
of
the
better
american
pale
ales
ive
had
and
an
excellent
choice
for
someone
who
wants
a
serious
hop
fix
within
a
lower
abv
beer
one
of
the
better
apa
that
ive
ever
consumed
overall
a
solid
apa
bitter
and
easy
drinking
actually
sits
a
bit
too
bitter
on
the
finish
and
it
impacts
the
general
flavor
on
subsequent
sips
incredibly
drinkable
regardless
welldone
this
is
the
best
of
the
hf
beers
ive
had
hands
down
you
cant
do
much
better
than
this
beautiful
in
its
simplicity
o
as
far
as
apas
go
this
one
is
really
hard
to
beat
its
amongst
the
class
of
alpine
hoppy
birthday
and
russian
river
parking
violation
my
two
favorites
its
good
out
of
a
growler
but
ontap
its
at
the
top
of
its
class
if
youre
in
chicago
come
on
by
for
a
pint
while
it
lasts
this
beer
ours
a
light
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
good
off
white
head
the
smell
is
earthy
and
citrusy
with
almost
not
malt
presence
nice
and
dry
just
the
way
i
like
it
the
taste
is
dy
hoppy
citryusy
and
wonderful
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbed
and
light
boddied
i
wish
hill
farmsead
distributed
to
mass
maybe
someday
they
will
overall
another
hill
farmstead
beer
where
the
citrus
just
jumps
if
all
hops
jumped
like
this
i
could
turn
into
a
hop
head
this
certainly
tastes
more
like
a
well
crafted
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
it
may
be
my
favorite
pale
ale
this
is
a
bitter
beer
but
not
overly
so
just
really
flavorful
growler
compliments
of
gluglouburp
thanks
again
dany
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
average
white
head
and
soapy
lacing
nose
resinous
pine
white
and
pink
grapefruit
rinds
and
sweet
tropical
fruits
just
an
amazing
hop
assult
to
the
nostrils
taste
light
bodied
cookie
dough
followed
by
a
juicy
and
dank
wave
of
hops
finishes
very
crisp
and
dry
to
the
pallete
although
with
just
a
touch
of
sweet
creaminess
great
stuff
o
overall
sometimes
a
sublime
work
of
art
is
not
enjoyable
but
is
disturbing
i
am
being
poetic
here
but
i
did
not
love
the
experience
of
drinking
this
beer
yet
i
know
it
was
something
unusual
and
special
the
bone
dry
bitterness
of
this
would
keep
me
from
actively
seeking
it
out
so
ill
give
it
a
4
but
this
is
a
really
memorable
and
intense
beer
this
pushes
the
limit
of
a
pale
ale
and
is
fresh
and
vibrant
tasting
the
smell
is
truly
exceptional
this
is
my
first
hill
farmstead
tasting
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
of
their
higher
apv
offerings
odthis
and
abner
were
so
delicious
hill
farmstead
has
such
a
cool
this
going
on
at
their
farm
i
could
drink
this
and
be
happy
for
my
whole
life
such
a
bold
stylish
apa
vermont
is
killing
it
d
supreme
the
reasonably
low
abv
exceptional
body
aesthetic
beauty
and
superb
taste
and
smell
make
this
one
of
the
best
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
imagine
it
owes
some
of
its
greatness
to
its
freshness
but
either
way
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
wonderfully
hoppy
bitter
and
flavorful
without
having
some
of
the
dehydrating
characteristics
of
some
ipas
and
apas
and
would
make
a
great
allnight
beer
at
the
anniversary
party
and
in
the
three
growler
fills
ive
had
edward
is
the
beer
i
keep
coming
back
to
at
hill
farmstead
i
dream
of
one
day
having
a
bierkeller
with
old
shelves
stocked
full
of
beer
around
an
old
oak
table
and
a
keg
of
edward
at
hand
this
is
a
pale
ale
really
the
quantity
of
hops
in
this
brew
and
the
overall
complexity
would
have
me
believe
that
this
is
an
ipa
or
even
perhaps
a
double
ipa
impressive
to
say
the
least
and
despite
that
conversation
i
will
use
my
words
to
order
this
any
future
time
its
on
tap
in
english
its
a
beautiful
beer
but
perhaps
not
worth
dirty
trousers
its
hard
to
make
a
good
pale
these
days
everyone
is
making
double
triple
quadruple
ipas
i
like
edward
though
he
is
a
good
dude
pales
arent
usually
my
thing
the
hops
are
heavier
than
id
expected
im
sure
edward
is
very
nice
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
hang
around
with
him
for
more
than
a
pint
were
different
people
o
nice
and
sessionable
i
plan
on
killing
the
rest
of
this
growler
tonight
o
simply
put
this
is
a
very
good
beer
easily
drinkable
well
balanced
flavorful
and
aromatic
in
my
opinion
as
apas
go
they
are
either
good
or
mediocre
there
is
no
inbetween
this
is
good
damn
good
this
pours
as
most
pale
ales
would
a
golden
body
with
a
white
foam
topper
the
aroma
is
of
many
many
hop
varietals
that
i
dare
not
have
my
nose
try
and
decipher
them
all
all
i
can
say
is
citrus
and
flowers
work
so
well
together
whilst
smelling
this
beer
the
flavor
is
quite
tasty
as
well
its
good
for
its
style
and
the
malt
body
accents
the
perfectly
added
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
delicious
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
more
people
should
have
the
grand
opportunity
to
be
graced
with
what
is
clearly
one
of
the
top
5
of
its
style
o
this
is
an
awesome
and
drinkable
apa
it
features
a
nice
presentation
of
tropical
smelling
hops
worth
a
try
and
the
gang
bang
enjoyment
begins
here
it
pours
a
cloudy
amberstraw
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
lemon
zest
mango
papaya
light
pine
light
caramel
and
light
vanilla
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grapefruit
peel
orange
peel
pine
lemon
peel
dark
greens
grass
and
flowers
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
kinda
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
good
apa
one
where
a
seeming
lack
of
balance
does
not
hurt
it
all
too
much
at
all
damn
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
whenever
i
wanted
to
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
dry
bitter
hops
that
linger
over
the
sweet
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
notes
and
pale
malt
backbone
info
a
spicy
dry
finish
very
good
balance
of
bitter
dry
and
sweet
notes
hints
of
oily
pine
mango
pineapple
and
straw
with
biscuit
and
graham
cracker
malt
notes
a
bit
watered
down
but
still
plenty
hoppy
without
being
one
dimensional
very
easy
to
drink
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
stuff
comes
highly
recommended
overall
a
revelation
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
in
northern
new
england
but
between
this
guy
and
maine
beers
peeper
the
landscape
of
the
american
pale
ale
is
being
changed
im
not
sure
theres
a
better
apa
than
edward
out
there
today
pours
a
hazy
yellow
orange
coor
with
a
white
head
leaving
some
good
lacing
nose
jumps
out
pretty
well
with
all
sort
of
citrus
bitter
grapefruit
with
a
little
dankness
and
some
biscuity
character
taste
opens
up
immediately
with
hops
grapefruit
at
first
but
i
also
get
some
mango
and
orange
coming
through
too
malt
is
almost
not
even
present
save
for
the
faintest
bit
of
bread
hidden
beneath
all
the
hops
a
touch
heftier
than
light
bodied
with
a
little
under
medium
carbonation
levels
i
fill
up
a
growler
with
this
regularly
if
i
could
nice
light
body
on
the
feel
with
good
soft
carbonation
overall
a
well
made
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
with
enjoyable
flavors
clear
and
pale
like
an
ale
clean
and
hoppy
deliciousness
with
tangerine
sexy
i
suppose
this
is
the
product
of
their
style
of
hop
additions
leave
no
wort
behind
a
little
bit
of
malt
character
but
not
much
body
overall
leaving
behind
a
clean
and
hoppy
beer
pretty
tasty
glad
to
share
it
with
some
good
folks
overall
its
good
not
a
great
pale
ale
overall
an
excellent
hoppy
pale
i
could
drink
this
all
night
medium
body
and
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
crazy
drinkability
on
this
and
solid
flavor
i
could
easily
plow
through
a
growler
with
a
friend
during
the
summer
months
o
very
drinkable
and
quite
quenching
edward
is
definitely
a
beer
that
you
get
by
the
growlerfull
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
is
just
an
amazingly
good
pale
ale
for
a
hop
head
just
lovely
wow
this
is
exceptional
i
could
drink
this
stuff
like
crazy
probably
the
best
pa
ive
had
the
most
dry
hopped
beer
i
think
ive
ever
had
straight
out
of
the
tap
it
smells
like
hop
pellets
had
a
whole
twenty
liter
keg
with
some
buddies
over
a
weekend
orange
with
nice
sticky
head
that
wouldnt
go
away
nose
opened
up
to
pine
cannibus
and
a
thick
orange
mango
note
the
nose
is
very
much
so
that
but
the
beer
itself
is
so
light
and
refreshing
it
sort
of
designs
the
palate
for
the
hops
as
a
very
delicate
matter
this
feels
like
a
belgian
table
beer
in
spirit
and
the
american
craft
hopping
palate
is
light
and
effervescent
and
nice
and
floral
a
fruit
that
is
sent
dry
with
hops
but
not
bitter
the
beer
is
dry
but
its
not
one
dimensional
there
are
subtle
hints
of
citrus
in
this
rainbow
of
hops
all
expressed
once
your
nose
is
attuned
to
its
glory
the
first
apa
i
could
have
everyday
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mikesgroove
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
had
during
hobo
tasting
5
while
sitting
inside
rj
rockers
served
from
growler
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
murky
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
bone
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
very
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
and
citrus
hop
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
the
citrus
aspect
on
this
one
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
i
really
like
citrus
in
my
beer
no
not
like
the
citrus
people
like
in
their
blue
moons
so
this
one
was
a
nobrainer
for
me
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
just
hate
mike
left
me
with
a
half
a
growler
of
this
at
rockers
when
he
left
i
blame
this
growler
for
getting
me
drunk
that
night
by
the
way
an
absolute
must
try
appearance
is
burnt
orange
with
a
thick
one
finger
head
taking
in
the
aroma
of
edward
is
small
event
in
itself
this
apa
is
beautifully
fragrant
with
citrus
hops
grass
some
other
elements
as
well
its
taste
includes
more
of
the
hops
pineapple
grape
pine
mf
is
medium
with
a
bitterness
as
well
as
lemon
in
the
end
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
overall
wonderful
pale
ale
i
walked
3
miles
in
brooklyn
just
to
taste
this
beer
and
it
was
well
worth
the
journey
exact
type
of
beer
id
like
to
spend
all
day
drinking
in
the
summer
4
0
d
i
have
doubts
that
labeling
this
a
apa
is
appropriate
but
i
dont
doubt
that
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
as
i
got
through
half
a
growler
very
quickly
the
hop
flavor
is
good
but
the
impressive
aspect
is
how
clean
the
yeast
is
not
the
most
complex
of
brews
but
worth
a
drink
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
beat
apa
ive
ever
had
this
growler
will
not
last
long
and
i
will
be
extremely
sad
when
its
gone
this
is
excellent
and
well
worth
seeking
out
skal
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
hoppy
but
without
being
too
bitter
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
what
a
great
base
beer
this
would
be
for
just
about
anything
you
wanted
to
do
it
is
a
solid
apa
and
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
pints
of
edward
overall
this
was
a
simply
amazing
beer
that
really
just
has
to
be
tried
i
have
ephraim
in
the
fridge
cannot
wait
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
apa
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
along
with
alpha
king
lots
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
at
5
2
abv
its
insanely
drinkable
i
felt
like
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
finishing
a
growler
by
myself
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
medium
bodied
smooth
and
juicy
this
is
a
beer
that
is
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
sessionable
and
quaffable
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
worthy
of
sipping
slowly
and
contemplating
and
with
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
than
many
ipas
and
some
double
ipas
at
only
5
alchohol
id
say
that
is
the
definition
of
perfect
drinkability
edit
011313
changing
this
score
to
my
first
perfect
5s
because
this
is
perfect
orange
colored
slightly
cloudy
with
weak
white
head
strong
hoppy
notes
in
the
smell
definitely
more
ipaish
than
pale
like
fruity
and
slightly
piney
smells
are
very
fruity
like
a
fresh
sculpin
light
and
refreshing
grapefruit
undertones
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
wow
the
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
id
hardly
call
it
a
pale
ale
but
who
cares
this
is
delicious
all
time
great
beer
need
to
get
my
ass
to
vt
d
pretty
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
the
strong
hop
punch
was
very
nice
as
was
the
lower
abv
but
the
chewy
feel
brought
it
down
a
notch
still
very
drinkable
tho
o
tried
this
again
and
the
descriptors
are
similar
but
the
beer
is
far
better
great
hop
profile
on
this
apa
very
tasty
it
does
have
a
home
brew
character
to
it
but
its
damn
delious
pours
a
very
hazy
light
apricot
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
the
nose
simply
explodes
with
hoppy
notes
ranging
from
tropical
to
citrus
with
a
bit
of
floral
and
pine
in
there
for
good
measure
simply
a
cornucopia
of
all
that
hops
can
do
to
a
beer
the
taste
drives
this
up
to
the
next
levelsimply
aweinspiring
wow
so
good
there
really
isnt
any
hint
at
all
of
malt
other
than
that
it
adds
a
bit
of
a
base
so
the
beers
not
too
thin
it
is
quite
dry
however
dry
finish
with
a
very
resiny
bitter
finish
so
much
flavor
in
a
5
2
pale
ale
i
simply
love
this
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
long
long
time
d
this
was
my
first
offering
from
hill
farmstead
and
i
was
very
impressed
im
excited
to
try
more
from
them
this
apa
was
nicely
hopped
with
an
earthy
flavor
profile
big
thanks
to
sean
for
hooking
this
one
up
at
growlerfest
part
one
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
tumbler
a
pale
orange
with
a
small
off
white
bubbly
head
that
sits
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
grassy
hop
aroma
with
a
straw
like
malt
very
subtle
and
clean
taste
is
hoppy
and
bitter
very
grassy
some
grapefruit
malty
bread
crust
some
biscuit
malts
not
too
sweet
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
kind
of
watery
a
very
solid
apa
this
one
is
very
drinkable
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
vegetal
hoppinessgrassy
at
times
with
mild
taste
of
green
herbal
acidic
hops
which
gives
the
impression
of
some
tealike
astringency
the
hops
have
a
spiciness
w
slight
peppery
heat
and
there
is
mild
sweetness
from
the
malt
w
a
faint
citrus
element
as
it
finishes
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
but
it
straddles
the
line
between
ipa
and
american
pale
it
has
the
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
but
lacks
the
malt
and
alcohol
so
it
comes
off
as
more
bitter
and
yet
still
is
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
hard
to
rate
it
higher
since
it
is
flavorful
but
seems
slightly
out
of
place
in
the
traditional
american
pale
category
d
really
good
brew
this
would
be
a
perfect
postworkout
beer
for
me
good
stuff
i
would
drink
regularly
if
i
have
the
chance
d
crushable
its
a
very
good
hoppy
pale
ale
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
daisy
cutter
or
parking
violation
but
thered
be
no
shame
in
having
this
as
your
local
pale
would
will
have
again
when
i
go
to
vermont
id
have
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
people
seem
to
love
this
beer
and
ive
heard
great
things
about
hill
farmstead
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
other
hill
beers
but
this
one
really
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
what
am
i
missing
d
drinks
very
quickly
because
of
the
fantastic
malt
and
hop
balance
in
the
flavor
which
ends
in
a
fair
amount
of
bitter
this
is
a
ballsy
pale
ale
could
easily
be
construed
as
an
ipa
thanks
to
the
huge
range
of
tasty
hops
cheers
taste
is
complex
american
pale
ale
that
stands
out
with
any
ive
had
great
hop
finish
md
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
leaves
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
extremely
easy
drinking
would
love
to
have
this
in
my
fridge
as
a
go
to
beer
great
overall
although
at
85
ibus
come
on
this
is
an
ipa
or
at
least
something
other
than
a
pale
ale
although
im
not
sure
the
appropriate
style
even
exists
havent
had
a
lot
of
farmstead
yet
and
this
one
clearly
stands
out
against
the
harlan
for
me
i
look
forward
to
the
fear
trembling
baconsausage
also
gave
me
thanks
again
tucker
d
yes
this
is
one
of
the
best
sessionish
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
i
would
love
to
see
the
hop
schedule
on
this
beer
my
first
beer
from
them
and
hopefully
not
my
last
very
drinkable
and
definitely
a
good
session
beer
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
though
my
personal
preference
because
it
kinda
kills
your
palatetongue
from
the
abundance
of
hop
bitterness
a
real
tasty
offering
to
have
just
one
pint
of
though
crisp
and
refreshing
with
light
bitterness
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
have
in
recent
memory
d
i
could
drink
this
as
a
daily
brew
at
5
2
this
is
a
beer
that
would
be
a
regular
go
to
if
it
was
more
available
purchased
this
at
the
brewery
as
many
others
have
said
it
is
so
tasty
with
a
perfect
carbonation
and
overall
drinkability
that
this
would
be
my
absolute
standard
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
i
feel
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
over
power
you
it
comes
at
you
in
a
subtle
classy
way
with
a
very
fine
appreciation
of
how
to
deliver
the
taste
of
an
ipa
without
overpowering
your
mouth
shaun
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
has
made
what
i
feel
is
by
far
the
best
session
ipa
out
there
from
my
tasting
notes
on
tap
at
the
black
door
in
montpelier
vt
im
surprised
this
is
listed
as
a
pale
ale
because
everything
about
this
beer
made
it
seem
like
a
highquality
unique
american
ipa
the
floral
nose
is
exceptional
with
a
twofinger
head
and
lacing
that
lingers
for
quite
some
time
taste
is
delicious
and
sesionable
good
hoppy
bite
up
front
though
not
as
hopforward
as
a
west
coast
ipa
but
very
smooth
with
a
mild
creamy
aftertaste
likely
aided
by
the
residual
lacing
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
am
very
excited
to
try
some
more
offerings
from
hill
farmstead
crickets
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
malt
based
beverage
if
i
had
easy
access
i
would
have
it
regularly
an
excellent
pale
ale
this
beer
is
so
hard
not
to
drink
it
has
that
inescapable
moreishness
that
the
english
apparently
say
my
staple
beer
from
now
on
whenever
i
can
get
it
a
full
flavored
hop
profile
great
balance
the
sugary
feel
of
the
malts
really
makes
this
work
and
a
smooth
drinking
body
really
set
this
apart
big
time
from
your
everyday
pale
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
id
have
to
say
that
this
was
probably
a
top
three
apa
for
me
this
would
be
a
hoppy
goto
for
sure
if
i
was
local
to
it
another
great
offering
here
from
this
new
brewery
edward
is
a
darker
shade
than
a
normal
pale
ale
not
to
say
that
he
is
not
normal
but
the
color
resembles
a
light
shade
of
brown
with
amber
while
a
mass
of
white
foam
is
up
top
kinda
sticky
lace
smell
is
hop
laden
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
a
touch
of
pine
small
malts
sweetness
as
well
taste
is
good
i
had
two
pints
and
i
hardly
repeat
myself
semi
citrus
grapefruit
and
pine
with
a
small
sweet
candi
like
maltiness
feel
is
bold
somewhat
bitter
and
nicely
carbed
this
is
easy
drinking
here
with
low
alcohol
and
enough
ummmphh
to
make
you
come
back
for
more
nice
pale
moderate
fruit
ample
malt
counter
balancing
a
gritty
hoppy
finish
tight
flavorful
and
enjoyable
id
love
to
be
able
to
order
another
and
another
very
nice
ipa
overall
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
had
a
pale
ale
quite
like
this
in
more
than
2000
reviews
and
its
damn
good
find
this
beer
this
beer
is
about
as
perfect
as
they
get
seek
it
out
id
like
to
have
access
to
this
brew
on
a
daily
basis
very
tasty
and
quaffable
lovely
hopjuice
might
be
the
best
vermont
beer
ive
tried
in
my
séjour
here
shared
the
growler
with
a
bunch
of
wine
drinkers
and
suprisingly
to
me
at
least
they
all
liked
it
top
notch
id
obviously
like
some
details
to
be
different
more
crazy
floral
hoppiness
but
thats
just
me
objectively
this
is
a
close
to
perfect
beer
very
drinkable
and
definitely
a
good
session
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
with
light
bitterness
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
an
apa
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
great
for
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
nice
work
shaun
edward
arrives
at
my
table
an
ever
so
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
it
is
dressed
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
with
a
wonderful
frothy
white
head
the
head
has
slightly
above
average
retention
but
leaves
some
of
the
prettiest
lace
i
have
ever
seen
perfectly
chronicling
the
volume
of
every
sip
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
wonderfully
fruity
with
a
nice
citrusy
c
hop
vibe
as
well
as
some
bright
grassiness
i
also
catch
a
hint
of
bready
malt
in
there
the
taste
is
killer
with
plenty
of
citrusy
grapefruit

complex
brew
one
of
my
favorites
smooth
delivery
the
hops
and
citrus
are
an
excellent
blend
had
fresh
out
of
the
bottle
the
sweetness
from
the
tropical
fruits
come
through
and
a
larger
note
from
the
grapefruit
the
citra
really
shines
here
great
beer
enjoyed
at
hunahpus
day
2015
at
cigar
city
brewery
in
tampa
have
you
had
a
beer
with
citra
hops
well
this
is
a
good
example
generally
cloudy
which
warrants
a
demerit
but
flavor
and
aroma
are
strong
lives
up
to
the
hype
thanks
to
justin
for
sending
this
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
aroma
bursts
with
pineapple
mango
apricot
and
especially
grapefruit
taste
is
an
explosion
of
the
same
carries
a
bitter
bite
all
the
way
through
amazing
beer
considering
the
low
abv
great
beer
when
i
can
find
it
poured
from
22oz
bottle
pale
orange
largely
clear
foam
settles
to
nice
film
smell
is
amazing
grapefruit
piney
bit
of
apricot
and
mango
taste
follows
suit
with
citrus
and
mango
mild
malt
on
back
end
fading
crisp
and
clean
feel
carbonation
is
spot
on
lives
up
to
the
hypemy
clear
standout
from
a
pale
ale
tasting
that
included
other
tg
offerings
and
those
from
other
breweries
wish
i
could
drink
this
much
more
often
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
solid
and
flavorful
but
nothing
particularly
remarkable
for
a
light
and
tasty
pale
ale
its
hard
to
top
this
lots
of
similarities
to
kern
river
brewing
citra
double
ipa
chase
this
one
and
get
as
many
as
you
can
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
wish
the
aroma
was
more
like
the
taste
hopefully
the
beer
i
drank
was
from
a
bad
batch
im
a
fan
of
a
citrus
beer
but
this
was
horrible
ive
only
poured
two
beers
down
the
drain
because
i
couldnt
finish
them
and
this
was
one
of
them
the
other
beer
i
poured
down
the
drain
was
a
strong
german
eisbock
the
first
drink
of
this
beer
wasnt
horrible
grapefruit
grapefruit
grapefruit
and
some
more
grapefruit
there
was
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
on
the
first
drink
but
nothing
crazy
as
i
continued
drinking
this
beer
the
grapefruit
was
becoming
so
intense
and
obnoxious
it
wasnt
enjoyable
at
all
the
aftertaste
was
very
funky
and
long
lasting
i
have
no
idea
how
this
beer
is
ranked
100
i
bought
two
bottles
to
share
with
two
of
my
friends
and
neither
of
them
could
finish
it
as
well
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
was
a
total
failure
in
my
book
its
hard
to
say
because
this
is
a
loved
beer
by
many
but
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
drank
im
going
to
give
it
another
shot
maybe
in
the
brewery
tastes
of
wet
grass
guava
and
almost
too
ripe
cantaloupe
not
bad
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
a
big
grapefruity
citrusy
apa
the
beer
this
one
reminded
me
most
of
is
sculpin
if
you
want
a
pale
ale
that
tastes
like
a
sculpin
get
this
perhaps
the
best
apa
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
finger
of
white
head
huge
aroma
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
resin
tastes
of
grapefruit
oranges
mango
and
evergreen
this
is
super
juicy
medium
light
mouth
with
good
carbonation
its
not
your
typical
pale
ale
but
its
great
my
general
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
either
older
or
may
have
some
sort
of
issue
because
my
experience
isnt
jiving
with
any
of
the
other
reviews
i
have
read
after
typing
most
of
this
it
reminds
me
of
a
zombie
dust
that
is
3
or
4
months
old
just
kind
of
flat
someone
else
even
noted
that
it
pours
clear
mine
looks
like
a
hefe
very
good
but
my
gut
feeling
is
something
isnt
right
leaves
that
ive
never
been
able
to
place
but
its
fkn
great
i
digress
bottom
line
drink
it
its
good
this
is
one
of
the
best
citra
beers
around
oi
would
love
for
this
beer
to
be
available
to
everyone
all
the
time
but
for
now
ill
take
it
any
time
i
can
get
it
hazy
golden
orange
smell
busting
of
mango
pineapple
taste
cantaloupe
citrus
banana
very
little
dankness
or
bitterness
but
it
does
have
that
grassy
after
taste
that
ive
noticed
in
other
toppling
goliath
beer
top
notch
beer
such
a
balanced
apa
never
a
let
down
o
a
fantastic
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
that
nevertheless
i
found
a
bit
on
the
thin
and
session
ale
side
for
my
liking
an
excellent
example
in
a
class
full
of
excellent
examples
my
meager
but
growing
knowledge
of
proper
beer
tasting
limits
me
its
amazing
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
sure
wow
better
than
zd
in
my
opinion
absolutely
loved
the
mangocitrus
on
this
one
will
be
trading
for
this
again
soon
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
o
great
beer
maybe
even
reason
enough
to
go
to
iowa
just
not
understanding
the
hype
this
is
very
average
this
is
probably
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
shared
this
last
night
during
superbowl
party
and
it
was
great
after
couple
drinks
of
this
really
got
the
mango
flavor
hope
to
enjoy
again
soon
overall
we
are
ecstatic
to
finally
be
able
to
report
the
findings
from
our
expedition
to
observe
this
whaleerrrdinosaur
in
its
natural
habitat
what
an
experience
in
all
seriousness
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
that
deserves
all
the
hype
it
gets
for
us
it
doesnt
quite
dethrone
the
likes
of
zombie
dust
in
the
area
of
the
american
pale
ale
but
it
comes
damn
close
from
the
first
whiff
through
that
first
sip
you
are
wrapped
up
in
a
world
of
insanely
juicy
dripping
wet
citric
hoppiness
that
offers
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
to
the
last
drop
if
anything
the
mild
lightness
of
feel
held
the
beer
back
from
being
the
best
most
invigoratingly
flavorful
experience
it
could
have
been
but
here
were
just
talking
about
why
it
isnt
perfect
fives
across
the
board
nit
picking
if
you
will
we
obviously
had
to
pick
up
a
growler
of
this
gal
and
savored
it
as
incredibly
hard
as
that
was
over
the
next
couple
of
days
on
our
journey
across
the
frozen
midwest
pseudosue
is
the
best
weve
tasted
from
toppling
goliath
and
an
absolute
musttry
overall
sue
is
a
great
beer
worth
the
hype
im
not
sure
delicious
but
very
simple
minimal
malt
backbone
for
an
apa
tgs
light
speed
is
better
in
my
opinion
like
a
delicious
fresh
adult
grapefruit
juice
light
and
refreshing
m
reminiscent
of
standing
in
line
at
hill
farmstead
with
a
few
tasters
you
could
throw
this
right
in
the
middle
of
the
taster
and
be
none
the
wiser
perfect
resinous
without
being
sticky
and
bitter
lingers
with
sweet
floral
hops
a
good
beer
no
doubt
but
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
current
rep
it
has
or
if
this
is
really
worthy
of
even
being
a
bomber
beer
would
love
this
in
12oz
for
fishing
or
pool
poured
from
a
bottle
at
a
beer
share
clear
golden
color
not
one
bit
of
haze
aroma
is
wheat
straw
lemon
zest
the
hops
were
not
as
apparent
but
this
is
a
well
balance
pale
ale
it
has
a
crisp
taste
to
it
with
some
sweetness
reminiscent
of
honey
and
melon
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
not
quite
the
hop
bomb
like
i
have
had
in
the
past
it
was
something
different
for
me
beer
is
really
balanced
but
i
think
it
mutes
the
hop
flavors
a
tad
too
much
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
nice
half
finger
frothy
white
head
lemon
zest
pineapple
wet
hops
and
a
good
dose
of
dank
in
the
nose
the
flavors
bring
in
very
similar
qualities
of
three
floyds
zombe
dust
perhaps
a
hybrid
of
once
again
three
floyds
alpha
king
and
alpine
nelson
based
on
their
underlying
effects
burst
of
dank
hops
orange
melon
and
some
honey
sweetness
from
the
malts
to
balances
this
beer
out
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
finish
which
brings
this
a
bit
more
closer
to
an
ipa
rather
than
a
pale
ale
in
addition
to
the
creaminess
there
is
a
medium
body
to
this
overall
a
very
fine
pale
ale
if
not
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
more
balanced
than
a
straight
citra
monster
crisp
floral
beginning
followed
by
mango
passion
fruit
and
orange
opened
up
as
it
warmed
as
in
my
opinion
the
tap
room
serves
everything
a
bit
too
cold
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
available
right
here
in
eastern
iowa
great
with
the
single
hop
citra
delicious
and
always
hits
the
spot
i
prefer
it
on
a
clean
tap
but
the
the
22oz
bombers
are
just
as
good
incredible
amazing
how
much
flavor
is
packed
into
this
relatively
light
bodied
and
low
abv
beer
super
luscious
in
the
mouth
a
mango
citra
dream
instant
top

pale
ale
along
with
trillium
galaxy
dry
hopped

julius
did
a
sidebyside
blind
tasting
against
zd
this
is
the
zombie
killer
dankidy
dankidy
with
a
sweet
finish
this
is
my
go
to
apa
great
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
if
you
can
find
it
o
oh
how
ive
waited
to
drink
this
apa
ill
stop
short
of
saying
its
the
best
blindfold
me
and
im
pretty
sure
born
yesterday
will
triumph
but
this
beer
warrants
the
accolades
it
gets
this
is
easy
drinking
tastiness
that
shows
a
deft
hand
in
the
fermentor
not
bitter
by
any
regard
but
booming
with
hop
character
i
love
citra
hops
but
i
just
didnt
really
get
them
in
this
beer
it
was
mostly
wheat
flavor
throughout
great
citra
smell
just
didnt
come
through
to
the
palate
overall
an
excellent
brew
a
lot
of
flavors
crammed
in
there
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
light
orange
tint
smells
of
grapefruit
sweet
malts
tastes
of
grapefruit
bready
sweet
malts
honey
and
floral
mediumfull
body
and
med
carbonation
for
a
pale
ale
there
was
no
shortage
of
flavor
excellent
beer
an
i
will
trade
for
it
again
great
great
beer
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
winner
just
like
the
blackhawks
4
0
over
the
maple
leafs
well
done
on
both
counts
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
the
mango
and
citra
hops
come
thru
so
incredibly
well
and
they
work
together
in
this
way
id
never
imagine
truly
incredibleinteresting
taste
smells
like
papaya
tangerine
bitterness
is
low
to
moderate
with
layered
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
super
juicy
would
bang
again
very
good
apa
tastes
similar
to
their
other
pales
ive
had
golden
nugget
light
speed
nice
crisp
ale
with
hints
of
fruit
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
is
worth
the
ratings
it
has
received
i
think
i
liked
the
zd
just
a
bit
more
but
barely
had
i
not
drank
them
one
after
another
they
would
probably
have
blown
my
mind
and
truly
my
mind
is
blow
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
these
beers
one
after
another
and
both
be
fresh
i
have
to
give
a
big
thank
you
to
my
trader
friend
from
iowa
who
got
these
to
me
cheers
man
top
notch
beer
no
doubt
if
you
can
find
it
get
it
if
this
is
the
future
for
the
american
pale
ale
then
theres
hope
for
its
survival
after
all
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
nice
hoppy
ale
smells
like
a
tropical
paradise
taste
of
light
pine
with
lots
of
tropical
fruit
slightly
sweet
this
is
pretty
good
a
nice
showcase
of
citra
hops
and
its
definitely
well
crafted
fantastic
love
the
balance
of
citrus
and
hops
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
not
quite
zombie
dust
but
great
in
its
own
right
great
use
of
citra
and
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
youll
find
tg
seems
to
not
be
able
to
miss
on
anything
they
brew
the
hype
is
real
on
this
one
unreal
pale
ale
tons
of
flavor
and
super
drinkable
obviously
o
this
was
definitely
a
treat
i
had
high
expectations
and
the
beer
certainly
delivered
what
i
wanted
this
was
the
most
enjoyable
single
hopped
beer
ive
had
to
date
highly
recommended
and
you
wont
be
diasappointed
citra
is
one
hell
of
a
hop
and
tg
blended
it
smoothly
with
their
malt
choice
stone
fruit
and
ripe
melon
magnificent
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
zombie
dust
total
4250
one
of
the
best
apas
that
i
have
ever
tasted
a
notch
above
zombie
dust
tg
definitely
deserves
high
praise
for
the
second
best
apa
out
there
awesome
apa
beautiful
beer
aroma
is
full
of
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
taste
is
very
smooth
lots
fruit
citrus
and
some
earthy
hop
notes
with
slight
hints
of
malt
backing
it
all
up
no
bitterness
at
all
this
is
a
beer
that
is
sure
to
please
newbs
to
hoppy
beers
and
seasoned
beer
drinkers
if
i
had
access
to
it
id
by
it
all
the
time
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
had
o

very
distinctive
hops
full

incredibly
well
done
bright
golden
color
very
little

bright
tropical
fruit
aroma
if
they
made
a
car
air
freshener
based
on
the
aroma
id
buy
it
taste
is
fantastic
mango
and
similar
tropical
fruits
a
little
pineapple
not
bitter
at
all
very
clean
and
smooth
extremely
drinkable
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
judge
others
of
the
same
style
by
you
go
out
o
of
your
way
for
a
beer
like
this
as
previously
stated
i
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
and
i
assume
the
hop
esters
would
be
much
more
pronounced
and
contribute
to
a
much
better
beer
and
sequentially
a
better
rating
with
that
said
im
fortunate
to
have
tried
this
o
this
definitely
caught
me
by
surprise
i
would
guzzle
it
if
i
could
pick
up
a
case
locally
overall
i
would
100
recommend
this
to
anyone
anyone
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
had
i
will
seek
it
out
again
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
edit
as
this
beer
warms
it
is
getting
more
vegetal
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
not
sure
if
this
is
normal
or
if
i
have
a
bad
bottle
not
undrinkable
but
not
great
either
3
75
rating
id
say
that
psuedosue
has
taken
the
place
as
my
all
time
favorite
pale
ale
the
tropical
fruityness
combined
with
its
extreme
drinkability
and
complexity
make
for
a
near
perfect
pale
ale
wish
i
had
access
to
this
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
over
the
top
but
found
a
really
well
balanced
mellow
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
acidity
from
the
hops
being
mellowed
by
the
malt
additions
an
outstanding
beer
obvoiusly
though
its
hard
to
think
of
this
as
an
apa
whatever
this
is
terrific
stuff
very
very
impressive
just
fyi
my
first
55
beer
o
a
fantastic
pale
ale
balanced
like
one
in
the
bitterness
department
but
with
way
more
aroma
and
flavor
from
the
hops
the
vegetal
character
i
was
getting
is
the
only
thing
i
didnt
care
for
in
the
beer
i
would
have
liked
to
have
known
the
bottling
date
on
this
thing
too
it
was
from
a
cooler
and
i
drank
it
the
same
day
i
got
it
not
sure
i
could
have
drank
it
fresher
hopefully
that
vegetal
flavor
isnt
the
norm
o
it
is
a
great
pale
ale
it
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
a
big
thank
you
to
fargrow
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
overall
definitely
see
why
this
scores
so
highly
a
very
welcome
addition
to
wi
one
of
the
best
apas
on
the
market

beer
from
tg
thanks
mykey120
for
the
opportunity
7
for
22
oz
bottle
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
not
only
my
favorite
beer
of
the
year
alongside
many
others
but
this
one
has
just
been
an
incredible
staple
all
year
long
it
has
all
of
the
beer
components
nailed
the
citra
hop
really
shines
in
this
beer
the
wonderful
marriage
of
subtle
sweetness
and
a
citrusy
punch
gives
this
beer
great
balance
notes
of
citrus
and
cantaloupe
just
make
this
beer
sing
this
is
world
class
this
time
i
bought
a
bomber
that
was
freshly
delivered
today
night
and
day
awesome
fresh
hop
smell
the
taste
is
so
much
better
too
when
i
had
it
on
tap
the
first
time
at
bbq
brickhouse
it
had
a
lemon
pledge
taste
now
its
just
nice
citrusy
greatness
my
biggest
want
finally
goes
down
the
ol
gullet
pours
a
slightly
hazed
yellowyorange
color
with
a
tight
white
head
soft
lacing
aroma
is
very
unique
i
got
a
big
whiff
of
garlic
and
green
onion
along
with
some
mossy
aromas
and
a
bit
of
cattiness
melon
and
mango
as
well
i
know
this
is
citra
but
in
the
nose
the
hop
comes
off
differently
and
i
love
it
the
flavor
legit
blew
me
away
each
sip
made
me
say
wow
even
louder
the
green
onion
and
garlic
and
cat
and
hemp
is
more
subdued
than
the
nose
instead
i
get
a
huge
rush
of
tropical
fruit
ive
had
plenty
of
citra
brews
but
this
one
is
very
distinguished
it
has
lots
of
tropical
fruit
but
the
flavor
of
honeydew
melon
is
so
damn
rich
very
grassy
i
also
got
a
minty
flavor
that
put
this
one
over
the
top
for
me
unlike
any
other
citra
brew
i
have
tried
the
body
is
just
hovering
around
medium
the
carbonation
is
lively
the
bitterness
isnt
too
bold
but
it
pricks
up
quickly
i
have
had
a
few
from
toppling
goliath
and
all
i
have
tasted
have
been
phenomenal
this
one
exceeded
my
ridiculously
lofty
expectations
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
enjoyed
via
bottle
113014
had
two
pints
on
draft
at
a
tasting
in
milwaukee
at
the
sugar
maple
spectacular
i
would
love
to
do
a
blind
tasting
with
zd
from
fff
as
these
are
my
current
1
and
2
apas
this
beer
belongs
in
the
category
of
crisp
hoppy
mildly
fruity
and
justenoughmalt
to
balance
it
along
with
mbc
a
more
interesting
version
of
lunch
lawsons
sos
and
hf
pas
bravo
overall
pretty
much
a
masterpiece
of
brewing
o
everything
you
could
reasonably
expect
from
an
apa
a
masterpiece
of
brewing
this
is
a
beer
you
would
take
to
a
desert
island
with
no
intention
of
returning
the
perfect
pale
ale
if
you
ask
me
definitely
one
of
the
best
allcitra
apas
out
there
remarkably
well
balanced
and
very
very
tasty
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
aroma
and
flavor
balance
out
quite
nicely
but
i
wish
there
was
less
of
a
dirt
presence
in
both
t
yeah
its
over
this
beer
is
ridiculous
tons
of
mango
and
pineapple
upfront
with
some
insanely
smooth
malts
blanketing
everything
pink
grapefruit
flesh
a
flash
of
pine
and
resin
and
then
a
smooth
finish
with
pine
and
mango
the
finish
lingers
forever
but
never
leaves
you
with
any
kind
of
bitterness
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
beer
is
transparent
and
golden
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
big
aroma
of
pine
trees
resin

grapefruit
melon
lovely
super
smooth
on
the

with

elegant
silky

finish
tropical
fruit
and

really
fresh
and
delicious
super
easy
to
drink
with
very
little

its
not

for

but
i
really

this

even
close

with
an

also
a

the

there
seems
to
be

low

this
was
tasted
headtohead
with
zombie

which
i
still
prefer
sue
did
not
seem
as
well

still
a
great
beer
however
o
ive
had
beers
with

hops
but
not
beers
with
mango
flavor
hops
tasty
unique
awesome
drinkability
maybe
a

i
wouldnt
put
this
on
the
same
level
as
hoppy
birthday
zd
or
daisy
cutter
but
would
put
it
on
that
second
tier
of
great
hoppy
pale
ales
with
some
stuff
ive
had
from
trillium
hf
and
tired

a

crazy
easy

oh
my
lord
i
got
goosebumps
when
this
first
hit
my
lips
expected
this
to
be
very
good
but
maybe
not
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
i
was
wrongthis
is
essentially
perfect
i
dont
know
where
to
knock
any
points
off
at
all
lives
up
to
its
reputation
and
to
me
is
better
than
the
other
hugely
heralded
citra
hopped
pale
ale
mango
and
minty
dank
herbs
compliment
each
other
so
well
and
this
drinks
way
to
easily
i
could
kick
a
keg
of
this
overall
yeah
this
guy
is
the
real
deal
i
didnt
think
id
enjoy
anything
in
this
style
more
than
heady
but
this
is
it
just
absolutely
incredible
i
tend
to
rate
my
beers
a
little
higher
but
a
perfect
score
in
all
sections
still
isnt
something
i
would
normally
give
out
the
hype
is
real
o
this
is
my
first
tg
brew
and
i
am
already
a
huge
fan
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
with
only
zombie
dust
coming
close
i
think
this
beer
has
better
flavor
than
zombie
dust
but
not
quite
as
good
of
an
aroma
i
can
only
hope
that
toppling
goliath
will
distribute
to
omaha
ne
sometime
soon
overall
i
have
some
in
my
fridge
to
share
with
friends
who
have
yet
to
try
this
but
its
just
so
good
that
i
might
have
a
few
to
myself
this
is
a
beer
everyone
should
try
citra
hops
are
my
favorite
and
this
is
my
favorite
citra
beer
so
far
o
good
dipa
however
the
strong
canteloupe
flavor
can
get
a
little
overwhelming
overall
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
just
an
outstanding
beer
it
reminds
me
of
zd
in
the
way
the
fruit
is
so
aggressive
without
kicking
into
that
level
of
pungency
and
bitterness
that
you
get
from
an
ipa
its
one
of
those
beers
for
which
the
taste
is
so
refreshing
that
its
easy
to
take
big
draws
out
of
the
glass
because
it
almost
gives
the
impression
that
its
quenching
your
thirst
im
halfway
tempted
to
sit
on
my
second
bottle
for
a
month
or
so
to
see
if
the
opacity
nose
and
taste
change
significantly
as
its
not
often
that
ive
gotten
a
hopforward
ale
that
was
this
fresh
i
say
halfway
tempted
because
its
so
good
that
i
doubt
im
going
to
have
that
kind
of
willpower
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
great
aroma
of
citrus
pineapple
and
grapefruit
hits
you
right
from
the
start
you
also
get
a
hint
of
pine
the
hype
for
this
beer
is
well
deserved
tg
did
an
amazing
job
with
this
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
production
increase
the
only
drawback
is
the
availability
an
really
smooth
ipa
very
little
bitterness
with
great
citrus
and
mango
overtones
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
very
aromatic
smell
i
loved
the
taste
of
it
and
enjoyed
it
more
than
other
well
liked
ipas
like
pliny
and
heady
the
only
bad
part
is
its
not
available
in
california
yes
zd
still
has
the
nose
but
pseudosue
in
every
other
catagory
what
an
amazing
and
unique
apa
have
had
this
brew
twicw
now
once
outside
when
it
was
19
degrees
on
black
fridayamazing
the
other
day
at
a
bottle
share
with
some
whalesstill
amazing
o
a
killer
apa
my
favorite
to
date
definitely
deserving
of
the
hype
this
beer
is
knock
your
socks
off
tropical
hops
mangocitrus
and
all
things
tropical
jump
out
of
the
glass
the
pour
is
a
gorgeous
golden
hue
nice
lacing
lingers
on
the
surface
taste
follows
smell
to
a
t
tropical
hop
bomb
and
i
love
it
tg
absolutely
kills
it
with
pseudo
sue
only
regret
is
i
am
out
and
have
no
access
to
it
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
that
ive
tried
certainly
among
the
upper
crust
of
citra
single
hopped
brews
out
there
very
worthy
this
is
one
of
the
two
or
three
truly
special
apas
that
id
actually
drink
regularly
if
i
had
access
to
it
drink
i
will
say
the
debate
will
rage
i
still
like
zd
better
but
this
is
pretty
good
for
coming
out
of
iowa
overall
i
possibly
could
be
biased
but
this
is
better
than
zd
through
and
through
ive
also
had
it
ontap
many
times
and
even
more
amazing
in
that
fashion
best
pale
ale
somebody
put
hop
pellets
in
a
blender
this
has
a
stupid
amount
of
flavor
for
a
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
this
more
or
less
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
lives
up
to
the
hype
buy
it
talk
about
it
drink
it
tell
others
a
very
tasty
beverage
bravo
to
toppling
goliath
for
the
ability
to
produce
large
batches
with
an
exceptionally
high
level
of
quality
throughout
this
bomber
was
thoroughly
delicious
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
and
eminently
crushable
would
love
to
revisit
this
one
again
and
again
exceptionally
high
on
my
recommendation
list
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
the
flavors
are
nothing
new
really
but
very
enjoyable
and
well
made
much
less
bready
than
zombie
dust
overall
this
is
an
incredible
beer
that
totally
exceeded
my
high
expectations
perfect
use
of
hops
without
going
too
far
its
amazing
how
much
hop
flavor
they
put
in
here
while
maintaining
balance
and
drinkability
i
would
consider
this
a
benchmark
pale
ale
huge
thanks
to
roostor07
for
including
this
as
an
extra
im
so
glad
i
got
to
try
it
a
great
show
of
citra
hops
a
hoppy
pale
ale
for
sure
not
harsh
though
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bite
a
very
enjoyable
apa
overall
zombie
killer
for
sure
pleasant
aroma
not
overpowering
not
too
bitter
well
done
pa
over
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
im
always
excited
when
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
seriously
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
overall
maybe
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
super
solid
and
one
to
look
out
for
overall
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
if
you
have
a
chance
you
must
get
this
beer
bottom
line
pure
awesome
this
is
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
its
that
good
looks
gorgeous
in
the
glass
a
completely
hazy
body
color
is
bananaorange
frothy
head
major
lacing
with
chunks
excellent
retention
hits
all
the
notes
aroma
is
of
strong
citrus
lemon
floral
and
mangoes
flavor
is
outstanding
real
lush
mango
lemon
rind
plump
citurs
fruit
juicy
refreshing
creamy
so
very
good
tastes
like
real
hop
fruit
near
perfect
think
if
the
aroma
was
a
bit
more
powerful
i
would
have
a
5
on
my
hands
o
not
sure
if
its
the
bottle
i
got
or
this
is
actually
how
it
is
but
after
smelling
this
beer
i
was
let
down
the
aroma
is
just
so
amazing
but
didnt
drink
as
well
as
the
smell
was
kinda
let
down
on
the
hype
an
extremely
clean
drinking
beer
and
holds
even
more
fruits
than
zombie
dust
an
also
citra
single
hopped
pale
ale
bottle
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
consists
of
tropical
fruits
with
light
citrus
notes
with
great
floral
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
huge
fresh
tropical
fruits
notes
with
light
citrus
notes
and
some
very
limited
bitterness
some
residual
sugar
is
perceptible
with
light
malt
presence
body
is
full
for
style
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
worldclass
pale
ale
for
sure
this
is
easily
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
it
is
incredible
how
tg
is
able
to
pack
so
much
flavor
into
a
6
apa
i
definitely
will
be
stocking
up
on
this
one
whenever
possible
o
a
great
beer
well
done
toppling
goliath
the
hop
malt
balance
is
great
i
dont
believe
that
this
should
be
considered
an
ipa
at
7
and
the
decently
sized
body
to
the
beer
this
is
not
a
pale
ale
o
this
is
very
good
but
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
low
due
to
the
relatively
high
sweetness
and
the
muddled
flavors
that
emerge
as
this
warms
holy
smokes
this
was
an
unreal
apa
this
beer
proves
that
not
everything
needs
to
be
double
or
imperial
to
be
outstanding
easily
the
best
apa
ive
had
the
pour
is
inviting
with
a
deep
golden
body
and
foamy
head
the
smell
jumps
out
of
the
glass
as
sweet
citrus
orange
juice
and
five
alive
the
best
way
to
describe
the
taste
is
like
squirt
with
tang
added
to
it
its
just
that
juicy
and
sweet
the
only
critique
id
have
is
that
the
sweetness
would
hold
me
to
2
glasses
or
the
22
oz
bomber
nothing
wrong
with
that
at
all
but
i
just
couldnt
throw
these
back
all
day
welcome
to
the
party
raul
i
think
i
just
may
welcome
myself
indeed
muted
taste
no
hop
punch
no
bitterness

o
gives
zd
a
run
for
its
money
this
is
one
hell
of
a
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
year
round
brew
that
in
my
opinion
makes
for
an
exceptional
springsummer
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
sun
out
on
the
deckporch
i
am
extremely
impressed
with
this
single
hopped
brew
goes
to
show
that
a
lot
of
the
time
simpler
is
better
o
the
perfect
apa
wonderful
o
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
i
really
wish
this
was
more
accessible
o
very
very
well
made
pale
ale
definitely
my
favorite
pale
ale
ive
had
so
smooth
and
sweet
hops
mix
so
well
with
the
malt
so
delicious
its
a
pure
citra

tropical
i
honestly
drank
this
so
quick
i
couldnt
get
a
fair
assessment
by
the
time
i
went
back
for
another
pour
it
was
already
out
surprisingly
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
slight
bitter
bite
o
the
best
thing
since
sliced
bread
if
toppling
goliath
considers
this
a
pale
ale
then
i
dont
want
to
know
what
an
ipa
is
some
of
the
best
use
of
citra
in
a
beer
ive
had
to
date
this
really
blew
me
away
thanks
again
paul
tasty
as
hell
drinkable
as
hell
a
superb
pale
ale
its
a
legit
pale
ale
its
not
an
ipa
labeled
a
pale
ale
it
is
a
real
deal
hoppy
pale
ale
really
complex
and
a
showcase
of
the
citra
hops
worth
seeking
out
king
sue
takes
the
cake
but
it
may
be
the
best
dipa
ever
brewed
b
a
nice
dry
finish
that
kept
me
wanting
to
go
back
in
for
more
solid
offering
from
decorah
i
will
search
out
again
this
year
o
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
apa
it
has
everything
i
love
in
these
hopped
up
apas
i
would
say
this
is
in
my
top
3
along
with
zombie
dust
and
edward
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
regular
basis
o
this
to
me
is
the
end
all
be
all
of
the
apa
category
just
hits
a
5
in
every
category
absolutely
awesome
and
so
happy
i
had
the
chance
to
get
a
bottle
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
this
one
out
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
very
strong
and
smells
of
tropical
fruits
and
citrus
the
taste
follows
the
nose
i
didnt
pick
up
much
bitterness
if
any
at
all
very
smooth
and
delicious
my
favorite
pale
ale
ive
every
had
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
o
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
i
love
the
mix
of
citrus
and
melon
aromas
and
flavors
lots
of
complex
hop
notes
without
being
overly
bitter
or
a
palatewrecker
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
would
love
to
have
it
available
on
a
regular
basis
it
is
that
good
onice
pale
ale
with
flavors
reminiscent
of
ht
pseudosue
is
a
flat
out
showcase
of
what
the
citra
hop
can
achieve
its
tropical
piney
and
dank
the
best
of
most
varietals
in
one
the
mild
malt
base
allows
that
character
to
shine
a
competitor
to
zombie
dust
i
suppose
all
i
know
is
that
they
both
fucking
rule
overall
i
may
have
found
my
favorite
pale
ale
though
for
every
moment
there
can
be
a
different
beer
to
bring
you
to
that
bliss
always
seeked
by
the
hardcore
beer
geek
this
will
go
in
the
books
as
one
of
the
best
pales
ive
had
along
with
zombie
dust
row
2
hill
56
and
hoppy
birthday
o
a
very
good
apa
up
there
with
zd
o
really
blown
away
by
just
how
good
this
is
perfect
execution
of
what
apas
across
the
world
hope
to
grow
up
to
be
bravo
tg
i
need
more
toppling
goliath
in
my
life
this
is
the
first
one
by
them
ive
tried
and
im
hungry
for
more
o
amazing
beer
well
balanced
and
incredibly
enjoyable
to
drink
drinks
like
the
most
flavorful
session
beer
ever
its
this
wonderful
middle
of
the
road
ipa
that
excels
at
balance
like
if
pliny
the
elder
and
zombie
dust
had
a
citra
hops
love
child
i
will
admit
that
i
am
very
partial
to
citra
hops
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
to
showcase
why
oa
bit
off
on
the
appearance
but
overall
exemplary
for
the
style
pseudosue
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
good
amount
of
white
foamy
head
nose
is
tropical
and
has
some
notes
of
earthy
piney
hops
the
nose
is
actually
lighter
than
i
expected
but
this
is
a
pale
ale
not
an
ipa
so
i
guess
that
makes
sense
however
the
taste
is
definitely
hops
galore
super
tropical
fruity
goodness
i
personally
love
the
citra
hop
as
is
and
toppling
goliath
has
done
something
truly
wonderful
with
it
here
this
one
has
a
very
nice
soft
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
beer
from
tg
and
if
the
others
are
anywhere
near
as
good
as
sue
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
o
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
immensely
drinkable
well
balanced
with
excellent
hop
flavor
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
offerings
in
the
tg
lineup
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
would
recommend
anyone
who
can
get
this
to
try
it
pour
is
hazy
peach
with
thin
white
head
nose
is
huge
extremely
hop
forward
faint
malt
base
with
tons
of
citrus
peach
and
grapefruit
taste
is
insanely
hoppy
malt
base
just
holds
balance
with
a
touch
of
slightly
doughy
grain
the
hops
are
the
focus
huge
citrus
and
grapefruit
with
notes
of
fuzzy
peach
skin
and
faint
bitterness
through
the
well
carbonated
finish
on
a
light
airy
body
great
stuff
reminds
of
brighter
heady
o
delectable
not
many
words
are
necessary
to
describe
how
great
this
beer
is
well
done
toppling
goliath
they
are
a
small
brewery
now
but
they
are
absolutely
well
on
their
way
to
topple
goliath
or
at
least
millercoors
and
anheuser
busch
o
this
beer
should
be
a
serious
contender
for
best
in
category
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
t
g
has
to
offer
i
will
try
to
get
my
hands
on
this
whenever
possible
prost
overall
a
really
great
take
on
a
apa
more
like
a
west
coast
ipa
with
a
huge
tropical
fruit
presence
pours
out
a
little
light
orange
very
translucent
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
little
retention
and
some
lacing
sure
there
will
be
some
nice
lacing
as
the
beer
goes
down
smell
is
really
fruity
definitely
some
grapefruit
guava
orange
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
taste
is
better
than
i
remember
the
last
time
i
had
it
on
tap
seems
to
have
all
i
found
in
the
nose
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
more
quava
and
sweet
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
for
the
style
to
be
sure
which
is
nice
overall
i
think
i
got
a
bad
pour
before
from
the
tap
or
had
too
high
expectations
because
i
really
love
this
beer
this
time
around
o
delicious
apa
delicious
beer
if
you
come
across
this
one
dont
miss
it
a
brilliant
pale
ale
showing
the
delicacy
and
also
the
versatility
of
the
citra
hop
mostly
clear
bright
sunny
color
here
inch
of
white
head
with
great
lacing
the
nose
is
citra
hops
all
the
way
citrusy
and
a
little
acidic
with
pineapple
and
passion
fruit
esters
happening
all
over
the
place
what
this
beer
shows
me
in
one
sip
is
that
the
citra
hop
can
be
used
successfully
for
bittering
as
well
as
all
its
normal
floral
and
tropical
aromatic
and
flavoring
attributes
there
is
some
solid
bitterness
here
in
pseudosue
which
works
awesome
with
the
late
kettle
flavors
of
this
hop
its
really
good
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
honestly
came
in
a
little
less
impressive
than
the
zeelander
from
toppling
goliath
which
is
the
single
hop
nelson
sauvin
ipa
this
has
more
bitterness
and
heft
to
it
but
still
sings
with
unique
hop
flavor
i
just
adore
it
fuller
bodied
than
zeelander
but
rather
easy
drinking
still
carbonated
softly
but
its
plenty
here
this
is
an
art
form
and
toppling
goliath
now
has
to
be
in
the
conversation
about
best
users
of
hops
in
the
country
this
is
superior
beer
clean
golden
color
allowed
a
brilliant
bright
white
foam
to
sit
atop
nose
and
tongue
perceive
the
same
elements
of
perfumes
flowers
musky
cannabis
leaf
earthy
floral
tones
and
whole
hop
cone
this
is
very
dry
very
crisp
and
super
easy
to
drink
my
palate
seems
to
have
found
this
differently
than
so
many
others
but
i
see
why
there
is
a
buzz
as
its
big
bold
and
daring
poured
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
light
gold
orange
with
a
short
head
the
nose
of
this
beer
smells
so
juicy
it
will
make
you
salivate
when
you
sniff
citrus
and
mango
are
slapping
you
in
the
face
the
taste
is
mostly
to
me
floral
and
fruity
with
a
bite
at
the
finish
allinall
one
of
my
new
favorites
in
hoppy
beers
i
think
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
citra
hop
because
of
this
serving
type
bottle
overall
another
great
gift
from
pintofbrown
really
love
this
pale
ale
the
nose
of
this
has
me
really
falling
in
love
with
hoppy
brews
cheers
overall
a
really
enjoyable
pale
ale
its
nice
to
see
brewers
take
this
style
seriously
even
though
they
must
realize
that
many
beer
geeks
would
pass
this
by
without
a
second
thought
while
reaching
for
an
ipa
or
iipa
never
realizing
what
theyre
missing
kind
of
makes
me
wonder
if
i
should
be
exploring
more
pale
ales
myself
o
amazing
beer
easily
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
i
am
so
glad
toppling
goliath
brewpub
is
on
my
way
back
and
forth
from
mn
to
iowa
city
love
this
beer
and
this
brewery
taste
and
feel
amazing
citrus
sweetness
and
leads
into
a
smooth
and
sweet
malt
profile
barely
bitter
and
great
aftertaste
a
weird
apa
very
fruity
yet
hoppy
lots
of
mango
some
other
citrus
smells
and
flavors
in
there
as
well
it
seems
fairly
watery
that
may
seem
like
sacrelige
for
those
who
love
this
beer
and
not
as
much
head
smooth
but
not
as
smooth
as
other
apas
like
the
sierra
nevada
torpedo
overall
a
great
apa
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
fantastic
up
there
with
zombie
dust
or
almost
gumball
head
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
great
hop
profile
wonderful
one
of
the
better
apas
out
there
a
regular
growler
rotation
staple
for
me
single
hop
really
lets
you
experience
citra
very
clean
brew
that
has
citrus
and
dankness
on
the
nose
and
tongue
foam
is
bright
white
with
some
lacing
and
moderate
retention
an
all
day
drinker
a
joyful
pale
ale
a
tasty
thing
with
plenty
of
citrusy
zest
to
keep
the
tongue
happy
this
is
the
best
pure
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
not
made
by
hill
farmstead
excellent
all
the
way
around
o
quite
a
complex
brew
given
the
abv
very
tasty
have
a
bottle
of
sosus
in
the
fridge
which
will
be
opened
soon
with
hopefully
the
same
delight
just
a
touch
rough
around
the
edges
but
bursting
with
flavor
love
this
im
gonna
make
this
easy
its
really
damn
good
it
reminds
me
of
super
fresh
zombie
dust
worth
the
hype
glad
i
had
a
brother
in
law
who
picked
me
up
a
growler
of
this
great
beer
on
his
trip
through
iowa
seak
it
out
for
sure
im
assuming
like
most
apaipas
drink
it
fresh
overall
fruity
with
a
slight
bitterness
great
aroma
very
drinkable
defiantly
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
more
i
drank
the
growler
over
2
days
and
thought
i
might
like
it
more
the
2nd
time
around
but
i
had
exactly
the
same
thoughts
the
next
day
i
dont
get
the
hype
around
it
at
all
this
was
my
first
tg
beer
and
ill
still
seek
out
others
though
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
with
its
dry
finish
and
fruity
flavor
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
very
easy
and
in
a
hurry
pours
a
lovely
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
good
retention
lots
of
suspended
floaters
throughout
good
lacing
amazing
aroma
tropical
grapefruit
dank
hops
herbal
faint
pepper
spice
peach
some
sweet
malt
notes
lots
going
on
in
the
nose
palate
is
as
complex
as
the
nose
slight
resin
bitterness
followed
by
subtle
malt
in
the
middle
finishes
bitter
and
dry
light
bodied
with
great
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
extremely
well
crafted
pale
an
outstanding
display
of
the
citra
hop
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
i
figured
it
would
be
comparable
to
zombie
dust
but
somehow
its
a
completely
different
beast
it
reminds
me
of
peach
tea
in
the
best
possible
way
the
fruit
flavors
are
somehow
unique
from
all
the
other
citra
hopped
beers
track
this
one
down
and
enjoy
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
overall
this
is
the
best
apa
ive
had
to
date
and
it
contends
w
the
top
dipas
out
there
o
hell
of
an
apa
one
of
the
very
best
ive
ever
had
i
think
the
only
competition
for
this
brew
is
zombie
dust
but
im
honestly
unsure
if
this
can
overcome
the
zombie
king
i
think
this
has
a
better
aroma
than
zombie
dust
but
the
drinkability
and
smoothness
suffers
in
comparison
razor
close
but
i
dont
want
to
take
anything
away
from
this
brew
it
is
top
notch
and
highlights
citra
wonderfully
great
dry
crackery
malt
backs
it
up
just
right
excellent
craftsmanship
medium
body
lightly
creamy
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
complementing
the
delicate
tropical
flavors
finish
is
one
if
the
best
ive
had
in
a
pale
ale
or
otherwise
very
mild
bitterness
and
mangos
all
the
way
delicious
from
start
to
finish
now
i
just
wish
it
were
regularly
available
poured
into
tulip
glass
i
think
i
smelled
it
for
at
least
5
minutes
before
tasting
just
an
amazing
combination
of
grapefruit
lemon
pineapple
pours
a
hazy
orange
almost
looked
like
orange
juice
half
inch
of
creamy
head
with
incredible
lacing
taste
was
a
sweet
hoppy
combo
with
a
nice
malty
finish
its
obvious
why
this
is
such
a
highly
sought
after
brew
this
is
an
excellent
beer
leaning
more
towards
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
in
hoppiness
but
as
refreshing
and
sessionable
as
any
pale
ale
could
hope
to
be
thanks
to
omensetter
for
sending
me
this
pours
an
unclear
orange
with
a
fine
white
head
nice
lacing
that
lasted
and
lasted
aroma
is
so
completely
floral
and
citrus
hops
very
lovely
taste
has
sweet
pine
bitter
citrus
and
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
malt
back
very
well
balanced
much
more
so
than
the
aroma
would
lead
to
believe
finished
medium
long
and
heavier
to
the
sweet
side
than
the
bitter
but
with
some
of
each
m
light
bodied
too
light
its
fantastic
but
i
had
a
few
sips
paused
went
back
to
resume
the
review
and
its
seriously
almost
watery
on
the
bright
side
ridiculously
easy
to
put
down
still
leaves
behind
a
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
oddly
enough
ideal
carbonation
overall
a
fasteasy
drinker
this
poured
out
as
a
murky
looking
orange
color
with
some
yellow
highlight
zero
clarity
on
this
beer
the
head
is
white
and
leaves
a
nice
thin
retention
with
plenty
of
sticky
clumps
of
lacing
the
smell
is
incredible
fruity
and
slightly
floral
citrus
and
melon
aromas
fill
the
air
just
from
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
no
need
to
even
smell
it
from
the
glass
the
taste
is
about
as
amazing
as
the
smell
beautifully
balanced
sweetness
mixed
with
some
piney
hop
resin
with
juicy
fruits
filling
in
the
gaps
the
mouthfeel
is
about
as
smooth
and
drinkable
as
ive
ever
had
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
overall
its
fantastic
i
am
thrilled
to
have
drank
this
beer
in
my
honest
opinion
this
could
be
a
zombie
killer
if
you
know
what
i
mean
definitely
worth
seeking
out
i
will
probably
try
to
get
more
of
this
one
in
the
future
its
outstanding
overall
awesome
apa
that
really
pushes
the
envelope
of
what
an
apa
can
be
this
dogs
zombie
dust
but
imo
is
just
shy
of
sosus
however
slightly
different
style
and
i
am
more
of
a
dipa
kinda
guy
overall
this
is
ridiculously
good
very
few
breweries
make
a
pale
ale
anywhere
near
as
good
as
this
o
really
juicy
and
drinkable
just
about
as
good
as
any
citra
pale
ale
ive
had
serving
type
on
tap
fresh
keg
just
reaffirms
my
belief
that
the
hazy
debrisridden
ipas
are
the
best
o
really
drinkable
and
delicious
showcase
of
citra
this
isnt
the
zombie
dust
killer
that
everyone
says
it
is
but
its
still
a
delicious
beer
that
i
would
have
at
any
opportunity
o
holy
tropical
fruit
very
tasty
and
fruity
ipa
o
ive
had
zd
as
a
6er
its
great
this
happens
to
carry
across
the
palate
even
better
its
so
good
that
a
noncraft
drinker
would
love
this
and
not
realize
that
they
just
drank
one
of
the
best
beers
in
world
thanks
tg
this
is
a
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
true
hop
bomb
without
being
a
dipa
overall
a
superb
pale
reminds
me
a
lot
of
russian
rivers
row
2
that
one
was
more
bitter
this
was
a
bit
more
sweet
but
thats
a
hell
of
a
comparison
for
a
newcomer
from
iowa
in
fact
this
might
be
better
top
notch
and
legit
stuff
cost
7
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
this
stuff
is
very
good
damn
good
and
drinkable
to
the
nth
degree
while
ive
definitely
had
a
fair
share
of
slightly
more
enjoyable
pale
ales
this
one
is
valiant
enough
to
join
the
best
of
the
best
club
i
enjoyed
this
only
slightly
less
than
what
is
enlightenment
and
they
are
reasonably
similar
beers
when
your
brew
gets
compared
to
something
from
hill
farmstead
well
that
in
itself
is
a
damn
good
testament
to
how
good
your
beer
is
decanted
into
a
tg
black
logo
goblet
also
thanks
to
dan
pristine
clarity
nice
orangeamber
color
with
a
firm
cap
of
foamy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
on
this
was
truly
out
of
this
world
i
got
a
blast
of
fresh
tropical
fruits
from
across
the
room
didnt
even
have
to
hold
it
to
my
nose
im
actually
kind
of
skeptical
that
this
was
exclusively
citra
as
ive
never
gotten
quite
an
intense
nose
from
that
hop
by
itself
but
yeah
pineapple
mango
orange
grass
twinge
of
ammonia
whatever
the
case
excellent
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
blasting
or
intense
but
pretty
much
more
on
line
for
a
good
apa
more
citrusy
orange
blossom
caramel
malt
sweetness
good
balance
low
bitterness
with
a
more
lowkey
tropical
fruit
profile
medium
body
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
i
prefer
a
little
acidic
twist
in
my
apa
but
this
didnt
really
have
that
with
the
malt
profile
coming
out
more
and
providing
more
of
a
balance
and
toning
down
the
hop
profile
a
bit
very
nice
overall
not
really
uberextraordinary
for
the
style
but
still
quite
good
thanks
to
duffman929
for
going
out
of
his
way
to
grab
this
one
appearance
is
clear
gold
with
white
head
and
decent
retention
aroma
is
citrilicious
with
bright
tropical
fruit
mango
and
a
bit
of
grain
in
the
back
taste
is
bright
and
fruity
with
light
bitterness
and
mild
gain
all
of
the
aromatic
hops
are
there
and
provide
nice
juicy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
delicious
brew
well
worth
the
seeking
mouthfeel
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
soft
carbonation
yeah
this
is
a
good
one
o
great
apa
rivals
zombie
dust
for
the
best
in
the
style
i
have
encountered
i
wish
this
was
more
accessible
for
me
definitely
would
drink
this
regularly
if
able
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
this
is
a
nicely
made
beer
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
i
can
safely
say
this
is
my
favorite
single
ipaapa
there
are
some
double
ipas
that
i
am
rather
fond
of
including
tgs
sosus
but
for
an
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
this
might
be
as
good
as
it
gets
cheers
appearance
was
golden
in
color
but
got
much
hazier
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
taste
was
clean
tropical
nectarine
refreshing
not
much
piney
taste
at
all
just
on
the
nose
barely
no
bitterness
either
just
a
tropical
nectarine
explosion
in
your
mouth
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
was
a
negative
thing
very
good
pale
ale
glad
to
try
something
by
tg
a
nice
change
up
from
the
west
coast
style
apa
thanks
socalkicks
overall
one
of
the
top
pale
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
thanks
again
steasy66
you
the
man
first
of
all
i
have
to
thank
my
new
ba
friend
mnbuffalo
for
sending
me
this
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
disappears
right
in
front
of
my
eyes
its
so
good
that
ill
take
a
sip
here
another
sip
there
and
before
i
knew
it
the
bottle
was
emptied
out
would
i
drink
it
again
oh
yeah
more
more
o
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
tg
is
doing
some
sick
stuff
in
iowa
got
to
get
back
home
for
these
guys
o
really
nice
citra
hop
pale
ale
as
one
would
expect
full
of
citrusy
grapefruit
flavors
and
a
big
hit
of
pine
flavors
are
dense
with
hops
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
im
not
quite
as
enamored
as
the
masses
but
this
is
a
beer
that
one
could
enjoy
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
contemplating
life
or
postmarathon
versatile
handsdown
excellent
overall
this
beer
is
incredible
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
had
get
some
of
this
o
this
was
a
fantastic
apa
and
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
and
easily
stands
up
against
some
of
the
top
apas
out
there
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
apa
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
one
of
the
hop
varietals
used
in
it
im
guessing
it
might
have
been
simcoe
that
being
said
it
was
a
great
apa
and
if
you
loved
sosus
you
will
love
this
cheers
o
all
foolin
around
aside
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
clark
and
toppling
goliath
are
doing
some
really
great
things
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
this
one
is
very
easy
to
handle
by
yourself
big
citrus
punch
that
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
summer
day
nice
clean
finish
that
doesnt
leave
the
taste
buds
burnt
out
scrumtrulescent
really
is
the
only
word
to
describe
this
beer
d
good
stuff
on
the
whole
but
actually
a
bit
understated
for
my
tastes
the
zeelander
which
i
preferred
had
more
crackle
and
intensity
still
id
happily
order
a
pint
or
two
of
this
if
it
was
locally
available
not
an
a
but
a
solid
a
in
my
book
overall
its
a
very
delicious
and
hoppy
with
a
lot
of
drinkability
overall
this
felt
like
a
good
hefe
more
than
an
apa
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
cannot
say
it
was
great
but
it
was
worth
going
out
of
the
way
to
try
i
cant
say
i
wont
stop
exploring
this
brewery
though
wow
i
think
citra
hop
has
finally
been
showcased
in
all
its
beauty
and
potential
zombie
dust
is
very
good
but
has
way
too
much
batch
variation
this
beer
has
been
consistently
a
remarkable
brew
and
i
salute
toppling
goliath
for
that
brew
on
brothers
verdict
a
tremendous
apa
from
toppling
goliath
the
flavors
are
balanced
so
well
the
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
and
really
lets
the
beer
shine
this
really
is
one
of
the
premier
citra
hopped
beers
out
there
and
any
and
all
comparisons
to
zombie
dust
are
well
warranted
as
a
side
note
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
value
as
well
a
6
bomber
at
the
brewery
with
no
bottle
limits
unheard
of
especially
the
night
before
a
big
releasekentucky
brunch
release
this
beer
also
edges
out
sosus
as
the
best
hoppy
beer
that
tg
brews
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
for
a
long
time
i
thought
it
was
an
ipa
i
recently
had
it
at
the
tg
taproom
in
decorah
and
fresh
its
even
better
hazy
pale
in
color
huge
citra
flavor
lots
of
hops
cirtus
pine
it
is
a
great
beer
i
have
it
listed
as
one
of
my
favorites
yep
better
than
zombie
dust
i
am
lucky
enough
to
live
less
than
20
miles
from
the
tap
room
drinking
this
beer
fresh
mixed
with
their
golden
nugget
affectionately
known
as
sues
nuggets
is
alcohol
bliss
do
this
beer
is
representative
of
toppling
goliaths
talent
for
channeling
aggressive
dryhopped
qualities
while
also
looking
like
one
of
their
pale
ales
unfortunately
a
bit
edgier
than
three
floyds
zombie
dust
citra
hops
border
on
bold
here
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
the
delicious
but
docile
cultivar
it
is
also
true
to
the
form
of
the
brewer
in
that
is
shows
no
yeast
character
which
seems
to
be
one
of
the
most
unifying
features
across
the
toppling
goliath
portfolio
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
not
the
best
but
still
high
on
my
favorite
list
imo
this
is
pretty
apples
and
oranges
when
compared
with
zd
the
nose
is
the
only
thing
that
really
reminds
me
of
it
the
malt
bill
is
clearly
different
though
and
not
as
refined
i
also
think
the
citra
character
whill
amazing
is
a
little
muted
o
i
was
really
pleased
with
naughty
temple
and
pseudosue
only
served
to
raise
my
expectations
for
toppling
goliath
this
is
an
amazing
beer
no
doubts
about
it
you
see
it
you
buy
it
very
likely
the
best
straight
pale
ale
ive
had
o
a
really
nice
tropical
pale
ale
extremely
fruity
and
sweet
perfectly
suited
for
a
warm
summer
daynight
really
drinkable
too
could
easily
have
several
of
these
overall
probably
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
this
is
astonishingly
delicious
and
a
perfect
representation
of
citra
hops
m
light
body
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
truly
enjoyable
pale
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
find
zombie
dust
to
be
a
better
showcase
of
the
citra
hops
but
unlike
zombie
dust
pseudosue
has
quite
a
bit
more
balance
that
makes
it
simultaneously
sweet
and
bitter
as
well
as
making
it
quite
quaffable
because
im
not
mouthpuckering
after
each
swallow
so
basically
its
a
bit
less
intense
but
is
more
balanced
and
drinkable
if
tg
starts
regularly
producing
this
in
six
packs
i
may
have
to
make
this
a
regular
session
beer
o
very
glad
i
was
able
to
buy
some
bottles
of
this
because
of
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
i
look
forward
to
buying
more
as
it
becomes
available
nice
work
tg
a
little
brewery
in
iowa
that
is
making
a
big
splash
with
the
beer
they
are
producing
overall
i
wonder
if
i
have
a
bad
bottlebatch
of
this
based
on
looking
at
other
reviews
praising
how
closely
the
taste
followed
the
nose
if
it
had
done
so
this
would
be
a
beer
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
as
it
is
it
is
a
good
apa
but
certainly
not
among
the
best
out
there
many
people
seem
to
want
to
compare
this
to
zombie
dust
both
being
pale
ales
that
focus
on
citra
hops
and
while
there
are
similarities
zombie
dust
this
is
not
still
for
5
a
bomber
one
cannot
go
wrong
with
giving
this
beer
a
shot
16

jesus
what
a
stunner
of
a
beer
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
from
the
first
bottling
run
hazy
gold
and
orange
a
dash
of
white
foam
and
good
lacing
juicy
stanky
aromas
float
from
the
glass
cattiness
mints
and
mangoes
jump
out
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
lots
of
spearmint
citrus
tropicalia
and
herbs
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
wet
and
full
overall
an
absolute
winner
from
the
new
school
of
american
pale
ale
this
is
a
really
topnotch
heavily
dryhopped
pale
ale
big
citra
hops
in
the
nose
but
theres
more
to
it
than
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
forms
a
perfect
stage
for
those
hops
with
a
lightly
dry
feel
and
a
mildly
sweet
base
reminds
me
a
lot
of
zombie
dust
and
thats
a
big
compliment
an
incredibly
tasty
sessionable
pale
ale
still
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
apas
going
highly
recommend
it
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangegold
color
the
head
isb
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
lots
of
passion
fruit
tangerine
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
even
has
a
pleasant
impression
of
fruity
acidity
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
light
and
hazy
looks
hoppy
alright
hoppy
somewhat
herbal
nose
fruit
blast
on
the
palate
with
all
sorts
of
tropical
notes
there
light
and
crisp
without
being
watery
excellent
drinkability
and
loads
of
character
a
good
fin
beer
make
that
great
the
citra
hop
is
responsible
for
turning
a
non
hop
head
into
a
guy
who
can
really
appreciate
the
great
aroma
and
taste
of
nonbittering
hops
heard
great
things
about
the
brews
from
toppling
goliath
so
jumped
on
the
chance
to
pick
up
a
growler
of
this
single
hop
citra
apa
the
first
pour
from
the
growler
into
a
pint
glass
is
colored
golden
with
an
orange
hue
with
a
slight
haze
present
tiny
bubbles
merge
into
a
finger
of
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
a
skim
layer
while
sticking
to
the
glass
nicely
aromas
of
the
citra
pop
out
of
this
brew
grapefruit
pineapple
and
mango
on
top
of
a
clean
crisp
malt
bill
taste
is
big
time
citraespecially
the
tropical
fruit
character
hits
me
upfront
with
a
hint
of
evergreen
than
followed
up
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
sweetness
ending
with
a
crisp
slight
bitterness
that
quickly
cleans
up
inviting
the
next
drink
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
with
0
alcohol
bite
super
drinkable
this
is
like
candy
yepi
love
citra
hops
a
super
brew
this
would
likely
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
easily
get
it
my
recommendation
you
dont
necessarily
have
to
wait
for
the
bottles
to
arrive
hopefully
2
months
bars
and
restaurants
around
cedar
rapids
and
iowa
city
continually
have
tg
brews
on
tap
or
make
the
trip
to
decorah
and
get
it
as
fresh
as
you
can
these
guys
are
the
real
deal
fairly
easy
drinking
very
good
beer
if
this
is
any
indication
of
how
good
toppling
g
is
like
i
need
to
try
more
from
them
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
a
very
nice
pale
ale
this
really
highlights
the
citra
hop
profile
ill
definitely
enjoy
this
again
previously
had
it
at
a
4
8
it
is
now
a
5
served
with
a
huge
fluffy
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
startlingly
fresh
hop
reminiscent
of
weed
plus
some
sweet
malt
citrus
resin
flavors
much
like
nose
bitterness
stands
out
just
enough
malt
and
carbonic
tang
to
balance
for
a
kick
butt
ipa
body
and
carbbonation
are
faultless
finiish
is
like
flavor
long
and
drrikable
v
nicely
done
toppling
goliath
got
the
best
qualities
out
of
the
citra
hop
all
the
great
flavor
without
the
harshness
that
i
object
to
in
this
hop
variety
just
wish
they
used
a
little
sweeter
malt
bill
to
give
a
little
balance
o
i
love
this
apa
the
floral
hops
tropical
flavor
and
richness
make
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
and
another
spoton
offering
from
toppling
goliath
im
very
excited
about
this
brewery
a
stupendous
apa
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
really
tastes
excellently
like
it
smells
only
bending
more
toward
the
fruity
end
than
the
bitter
the
result
is
a
very
sweet
ipa
thats
very
interesting
and
refreshing
but
could
have
been
just
a
bit
more
balanced
overall
i
didnt
care
for
many
other
patrons
had
pints
after
the
tasting
just
cant
get
over
the
ammonia
i
tastesmell
in
the
beer
o
this
is
an
awesome
pale
ale
ive
had
nothing
like
this
before
this
is
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
could
easily
drink
this
with
a
brunch
or
would
be
lovely
on
the
porch
in
the
summer
toppling
goliath
has
a
real
winner
here
tropical
citrusy
pungent
but
not
too
aggressive
mango
grapefruit
dank
green
hops
mesh
with
lush
fresh
fruit
notes
in
the
aroma
some
light
resiny
bitterness
is
balanced
with
a
subtle
pale
malt
presence
in
the
middle
big
on
citrus
and
tropical
mango
notes
light
bodied
quenching
and
very
tasty
i
could
have
sat
there
and
drank
this
all
day
pretty
much
the
epitome
of
a
hopheads
summer
session
beer
second
favorite
after
golden
nugget
please
put
this
in
sixpacks
guys
new
favorite
for
me
great
refreshing
rye
o
plenty
of
flavor
from
this
pale
ale
with
a
nice
kick
from
the
rye
addition
while
i
get
rye
notes
this
was
just
an
everyday
pale
ale
this
is
the
least
rye
tasting
rye
brew
ive
had
however
i
really
like
it
the
floral
smell
introduces
a
floral
and
honey
taste
leaving
an
oily
and
slightly
bitter
after
taste
as
a
pale
ale
its
great
its
an
every
day
drinker
but
not
at
2
25
per
bottle
at
the
store
id
drink
it
again
o
a
solid
pale
ale
i
have
been
passing
this
one
up
in
the
beer
store
and
im
sorry
ive
waited
so
long
to
give
it
a
shot
a
new
go
to
pale
ale
one
of
the
terrapin
staples
and
one
of
the
firsts
beers
to
bring
rye
into
my
world
back
in
the
day
so
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
it
used
to
be
real
intense
on
the
rye
but
i
think
the
rest
of
the
industry
has
caught
up
to
the
point
where
this
seems
almost
light
in
that
regard
a
nice
hoppy
pale
and
the
rye
gives
it
a
lot
of
earthen
character
definitely
distinct
although
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
spicy
which
is
what
we
usually
use
to
describe
the
contribution
of
rye
its
more
of
its
synergy
with
the
hops
that
makes
this
one
unique
its
balanced
like
most
terrapin
beers
meaning
in
this
instance
that
the
hops
and
the
grain
are
both
flavorful
all
the
way
through
not
like
a
malty
front
end
and
a
hoppy
finish
its
not
like
that
at
all
the
beer
is
just
a
tad
sweet
and
the
hops
are
a
little
generic
to
me
you
know
c
varietal
stuff
but
the
composition
of
the
whole
is
excellent
and
a
landmark
really
not
my
favorite
terrapin
beer
at
all
but
one
of
the
ones
i
respect
the
most
my
first
go
to
pale
ale
that
i
still
enjoy
from
time
to
time
something
about
the
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
just
isnt
working
for
my
tastes
a
little
sweet
upfront
with
alot
of
earthy
and
black
pepper
flavors
if
that
is
what
im
tasting
and
a
crisp
slight
bitter
finish
ive
had
several
rye
based
beers
and
none
have
the
smelltastes
im
picking
up
in
this
one
many
other
pale
ales
and
lighter
rye
based
beers
id
prefer
over
this
one
while
it
may
not
be
some
all
star
beer
that
people
rave
about
this
is
one
beer
that
i
could
drink
any
day
pretty
well
balanced
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
hops
and
craft
beer
solid

drinkable

some
citrus
on

follows
onto
the

finishes
with

spice
very
nice
just
a
good
amount
of
hop
bit
but
enough
caramel

to
round
it
out
the
fuck

the
tick
rating
the
label
states
the

original
and
features
a
banjo
playing
terrapin
a
la
the
grateful
dead
the
ale
is
very
good
but
hardly
original
or
distinct
the
rye
does
give
it
a
little
extra
flavor
sometimes
missing
in
other
mild
lowhopped
pale
ales
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
complex
but
doesnt
fall
apart
which
helps
it
to
stand
out
color
and
lacing
taste
is
bland
skunk
adjunct
not
an
old
bottle
btw
drink
by
1214
it
tastes
like
a
citrusy
apa
with
a
rye
twist
not
otherwise
just
to
spice
things
up
a
bit
though
it
increases
through
out
the
degustation
really
well
crafted
beer
that
is
worth
trying
overall
pretty
good
great
color
a
nice
dry
flavor
i
would
order
this
again
a
nice
copper
hued
ale
with
a
sticky
white
head
and
good
lacing
smells
like
rye
biscuit
and
citrus
taste
is
nice
starts
off
with
citrus
flavors
something
between
lemon
and
orange
then
as
the
rye
comes
on
the
taste
is
of
apple
and
then
the
spicy
rye
which
lingers
afterward
nice
beer
very
solid
if
you
like
rye
seek
this
one
out
if
you
dig
ryes
and
ipas
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
i
dont
happen
to
be
fond
of
either
so
the
score
i
gave
must
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
love
ryes
and
this
pale
ale
did
not
dissapoint
great
balance
rye
comes
through
well
very
smooth
and
on
the
lighter
side
for
some
of
the
rye
beers
ive
had
love
reds
too
and
they
seem
to
share
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
i
liked
it
and
i
am
not
a
hophead
tropical
fruit
peach
and
citrus
up
front
with
some
rye
spice
following
close
behind
pretty
full
body
for
the
style
and
more
sweetness
than
is
typical
in
an
apa
this
is
my
last
bottle
of
the
sixer
and
ive
also
noted
some
bitter
metallic
offnotes
at
times
sort
of
coppery
but
for
the
most
part
its
just
pleasantly
juicy
and
hoppy
although
a
bit
big
in
body
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
o
overall
a
rather
lovely
pale
ale
good
and
reliable
this
could
be
a
new
go
to
summer
bbq
pale
ale
taste
is
a
little
grapefruit
and
lemon
giving
way
to
a
thin
watery
middle
malt
is
elusive
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
and
taste
is
light
a
decent
beer
but
lacking
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
decent
but
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
sharp
with
rye
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
starts
with
a
full
rye
malt
taste
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
coming
out
in
the
sweetness
of
the
middle
followed
quickly
by
a
nicely
bitter
hops
finish
the
feel
is
robust
and
wet
giving
it
a
liquid
bread
quality
that
i
like
in
a
malty
rye
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
rye
ale
with
a
lot
of
malt
and
nice
use
of
the
hops
to
compliment
those
qualities
rjt
decent
feel
with
said
texture
which
segues
to
a
citrus
hop
close
spice
fruit
and
then
a
neutral
sweetness
to
finish
malt
depth
again
comes
across
as
more
english
in
style
but
easy
drinking
pale
ale
nonetheless
o
a
decent
session
beer
less
hoppy
than
some
of
terrapins
other
hop
bombs
o
given
time
a
bunch
of
pleasant
aromas
and
flavors
present
themselves
love
rye
beers
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
a
quite
easy
drinking
and
still
very
tasty
rye
brew
that
is
blended
nicely
with
sweet
spice
and
crisp
flavors
which
really
make
for
an
easy
drinker
definitely
a
good
brew
but
kinda
on
the
average
level
recommended
o
given
time
a
bunch
of
pleasant
aromas
and
flavors
present
themselves
however
they
dont
quite
explode
like
they
beg
to
allinall
quite
6pack
worthy
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
have
again
the
flavours
dont
work
that
well
together
nice
little
session
ale
lot
of
the
citrusy
hop
with
the
spicy
and
dryness
of
rye
low
abv
but
lot
of
flavor
almost
in
ipa
territory
without
being
overly
bitter
discounted
not
100
fresh
but
look
forward
to
the
next
fresh
batch
and
will
try
to
pick
some
up
then
a
good
goto
session
beer
hard
to
find
where
i
live
every
time
i
go
south
of
the
masondixon
line
i
make
a
stop
at

only
34

terrapin
rye
pale
ale
wins
a
taste
off
over
cricket
hill
american
ale
but
both
are
surprisingly
good
original
and
worth
trying
not
nearly
the
tingle
and
the
lively
pine
freshness
of
a
dales
pale
honestly
after
a
couple
of
these
last
night
i
wondered
why
i
found
the
flavor
overall
too
light
supposing
i
was
used
to
my
more
hoppy
preference
of
ipa
there
is
grain
but
not
the
ultimate
delivery
of
grain
i
would
have
rather
it
came
across
more
robust
yet
this
evening
as
i
returned
from
work
not
really
looking
forward
to
polishing
off
another
bite
of
it
i
found
instead
it
wasnt
so
bad

different
o
a
good
beer
but
needs
a
bit
of
refining
notes
very
much
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
terrapin
can
do
better
than
this
true
i
might
be
too
keen
on
the
rye
and
the
softness
here
is
not
to
my
palate
but
even
as
a
pale
ale
it
feels
pretty
nondescript
and
generic
i
tried
this
first
socially
on
tap
in
atlanta
a
while
back
and
had
not
much
of
a
memory
of
it
so
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
try
it
again
but
sometimes
things
are
better
left
in
those
bland
memories
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
smells
mostly
of
sweet
caramel
and
pine
not
a
very
aromatic
brew
but
it
smells
nice
taste
is
more
of
the
same
sweet
malts
balance
out
the
pine
pretty
light
tasting
beer
with
good
carbonation
overall
very
pleasant
apa
perfect
lawnmower
beer
well
balanced
and
tasty
definitely
a
good
value
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
and
well
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
down
south
or
up
north
if
you
can
find
it
ive
heard
that
terrapin
tends
to
be
a
sloppy
brewery
and
this
beer
leads
me
to
believe
that
it
is
probably
true
good
in
conception
but
the
execution
leaves
something
to
be
desired
what
can
i
say
a
wonderful
pale
ale
with
a
twist
of
rye
grain
yet
balanced
satisfied
customer
o
high
drinkability
making
it
a
fantastic
session
beer
i
go
back
to
this
one
over
and
over
cheers
the
color
is
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
14
rich
white
head
the
smell
was
a
grassy
like
a
meadow
and
floral
hops
with
some
sweetness
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
sweet
rye
malts
slight
pine
tones
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
there
is
a
little
peppery
background
the
brew
is
effervescent
and
easy
drinking
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
not
overly
memorable
but
certainly
worthy
a
nice
twist
on
the
pale
ale
with
the
rye
malt
not
much
hops
to
it
but
it
is
very
easy
drinking
o
refreshing
and
good
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
taste
is
nice
and
the
rye
is
a
good
addition
to
a
solid
apa
would
drink
again
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
well
crafted
theres
decent
complexity
and
the
balance
is
pretty
good
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
and
ill
buy
it
again
in
the
future
i
like
the
way
the
rye
works
with
the
rest
of
the
recipe
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
apa
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
that
demonstrates
balance
overall
this
beer
is
as
good
as
it
was
3
years
ago
when
i
was
down
in
georgia
for
work
for
my
old
job
happy
that
i
scored
a
bottle
but
disappointed
that
i
only
got
one
a
great
rye
pa
and
wish
they
would
make
a
rye
ipa
might
have
to
go
south
to
get
another
bottle
there
arent
a
lot
of
rye
beers
on
the
market
that
i
have
found
but
this
is
surely
the
best
of
those
that
i
have
cheers
o
decent
beer
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
went
to
j
clydes
in
birmingham
as
established
on
beer
advocate
and
first
beer
i
tried
was
the
terrapin
rye
pale
ale
the
beer
was
a
decent
copperamber
brew
with
limited
white
head
which
casued
me
to
downgrade
the
beer
slightly
the
aromas
are
awesome
rye
bread
fresh
oily
hops
a
few
spicy
hop
notes
and
some
citrus
fruits
are
present
as
well
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
very
well
integrated
there
is
definately
an
excelent
blend
of
flavors
going
on
here
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
simply
awesome
a
very
interesting
ryepa
definitely
recommed
o
this
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
but
hits
the
style
pretty
well
for
a
rye
the
hops
arent
very
present
but
it
goes
down
smooth
o
a
very
easy
drinking
apa
the
rye
gives
it
a
nice
little
twist
good
goto
rye
beer
its
a
nice
beer
definitely
more
complex
than
i
expected
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
recognize
the
rye
o
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
away
and
the
taste
just
urges
you
to
crack
open
another
one
like
i
stated
earlier
i
dont
normally
like
pas
but
i
would
buy
this
again
o
decent
but
off
too
light
on
the
hops
and
even
the
rye
is
not
overly
apparent
drinkability
is
good
but
i
probably
wouldnt
revisit
another
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
sweet
floral
hop
aroma
rye
and
hops
combine
in
the
taste
to
make
a
bitter
but
pleasant
experience
followed
by
a
sweet
finish
while
this
a
fairly
serviceable
pale
ale
its
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
i
wouldnt
tell
you
not
to
pick
it
up
d
this
drinks
quite
nicely
87
overall
this
beer
has
a
great
flavor
profile
that
is
rich
deep
and
multifaceted
great
for
the
summer
in
my
opinion
and
it
is
a
perfect
balance
of
all
aspects
that
make
a
beer
great
in
flavor
and
drinkability
it
doesnt
have
the
bright
hoppiness
of
some
ipas
nor
the
brassy
bottom
end
hoppiness
of
most
dipas
but
a
good
middle
range
mellow
yet
forceful
satisfying
flavors
that
are
hitting
the
spot
right
now
overall
decent
ryepale
ale
without
much
hops
nicely
drinkable
sessionable
o
eh
i
usually
enjoy
rye
beers
but
this
one
leaves
me
a
little
disappointed
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
given
me
a
new
appreciation
for
rye
beers
i
would
certainly
try
this
one
again
o
decent
beer
its
a
nice
twist
on
a
typical
apa
if
it
were
available
in
my
distribution
area
id
pick
up
a
six
pack
every
so
often
rye
pale
ales
are
interesting
enough
a
bit
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
but
easy
enough
to
drink
as
usual
i
appreciate
terrapins
effort
overall
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
too
remarkable
either
thanks
again
jacob
o
a
good
but
not
great
beer
worth
trying
for
sure
but
in
a
market
flooded
with
apas
it
isnt
one
that
i
buy
all
that
often
o
not
great
but
very
much
what
i
wanted
in
this
summer
moment
light
drying
and
very
enjoyable
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
most
of
the
way
down
it
smells
citrusy
and
resiney
it
has
a
nice
hop
bite
at
first
but
settles
quickly
back
into
a
malty
and
bready
ending
a
classic
beer
in
the
south
that
can
be
had
at
any
time
of
the
year
one
to
have
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
o
a
great
tasting
brew
and
has
given
me
a
new
appreciation
for
rye
beers
thanks
to
sam
for
bringing
this
back
to
louisiana
from
birmingham
al
all
in
all
pretty
damn
drinkable
and
an
impressive
brew
the
rye
seems
to
show
through
well
despite
only
being
10
of
the
bill
but
im
not
complaining
delicious
overall
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again

golden
yellow
in
color
with
an
orange
hue
and

few
sticky
lacings
on
the

bready

fresh

with
refreshing

nice
balance
of
bready
malt
and
light
lemon
hop
from
beginning
through
the
middle
the
rye
malt
flavors
come
through
toward
the
end
and
lead
to
a
dry
bitter
finish
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
pours
an
orange

with
a
fluffy
bone
white
cap
retention
was
soso
with
some
delicate
lace
strewn
about
the
aroma
was
of
spicy
rye
and
grapefruit
with
a
bed
of
caramel
malt
there
is
a
nice
balance
here
as
the
rye
lends
a
perfect
amount
of
spice
and
dryness
while
the
hops
deliver
grapefruit
and
orange
flavors
and
a
mild
bitterness
the
malt
holds
its
own
keeping
the
hops
from
stealing
the
show
easily
drinkable
medium
body
with
a
dry
mildly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
solid
rye
pale
ale
nothing
too
extremea
straightforward
example
of
the
style
done
pretty
well
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
wish
it
was
distributed
in
wisconsin
id
definitely
drink
it
again
overall
still
loving
all
the
beers
i
have
tried
from
terrapin
beer
co
great
summer
session
beer
this
beer
isnt
a
hop
bomb
but
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
touch
of
spice
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
at
one
sitting
appears
a
transparent
medium
gold
with
light
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
to
make
a
small
white
head
fades
into
a
small
white
cap
and
rich
collar
rings
of
spotty
lacing
are
left
around
the
glass
smell
is
of
citrusy
grapefruit
orange
grain
and
a
touch
of
rye
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aromas
with
citrusy
hops
breaking
through
to
liven
things
up
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
citrusy
juicy
chewy
balanced
nicely
with
a
dry
finish
i
was
hoping
for
more
rye
but
this
is
a
good
all
around
brew
do
easy
to
drink
and
a
nicer
light
beer
well
brewed
but
not
standing
out
enough
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
nice
looking
brew
a
good
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
pretty
hoppy
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
overall
i
find
the
rye
squared
to
be
much
better
than
this
one
all
in
all
this
one
was
just
a
little
light
for
me
othis
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
its
crisp
clear
and
a
great
brew
o
this
is
a
nice
rye
pale
ale
4
flavor
becomes
quite
malty
and
even
sweeter
as
the
beer
warms
grainy
tannins
in
the
finish
not
overly
pleasant
ones
balanced
but
not
overly
impressive
the
body
was
nice
and
crisp
with
the
finish
being
dry
and
clean
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
sweetness
drinkability
was
very
good
this
would
be
a
regular
for
me
if
it
were
local
here
overall
a
very
good
beer
worth
trying
when
you
can
get
one
ooverall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
apa
its
definitely
not
exciting
in
any
aspect
but
it
is
smooth
and
decent
to
drink
when
you
have
something
else
to
occupy
you
while
you
drink
it
i
would
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
apa
right
now
and
it
is
quite
sessionable
cheers
this
is
a
very
good
apa
very
good
drinking
sessionable
brew
that
looks
and
tastes
great
i
havent
tried
a
lot
of
terrapins
brews
yet
but
terrapin
has
been
a
winner
in
my
book
so
far
very
good
stuff
this
is
a
very
thin
beer
not
the
worst
thing
for
a
pale
ale
but
it
could
use
a
touch
more
body
finish
is
quite
dry
with
some
spicy
rye
leftover
after
every
sip
nice
beer
just
doesnt
quite
hit
in
the
flavor
department
o
a
great
rye
apa
that
is
hard
to
compare
because
there
really
are
not
that
many
out
there
a
great
go
to
and
very
sessionable
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
weak
hops
malts
everything
are
understated
they
are
there
and
the
rye
is
identifiable
and
its
well
balanced
just
not
particularly
flavorful
o
wellcrafted
apa
a
very
dependable
like
certainly
above
average
and
recommended
overall
potential
session
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
and
taste
d
i
think
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
as
good
as
you
could
hope
for
its
one
that
i
could
enjoy
sipping
all
night
long
i
think
it
would
make
a
remarkable
pairing
with
a
good
cigar
and
i
believe
i
have
one
in
mind
for
the
second
bottle
which
i
will
be
opening
forthwith
man
i
love
having
a
midweek
afternoon
off
this
is
something
i
will
likely
keep
on
hand
it
wont
take
the
place
of
the
hoppier
beers
that
are
my
first
zymurgological
passion
but
will
certainly
fill
in
nicely
on
a
lazy
afternoon
like
today
overall
still
not
too
bad
you
could
do
worse
but
you
sure
could
do
a
bit
better
d
this
beer
is
a
subtle
and
understated
yet
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
that
features
rye
qualities
in
favorable
and
appropriate
measures
while
more
maltfocused
flavors
are
kept
very
near
to
perfect
balance
this
is
a
beer
that
may
grow
on
the
drinker
with
each
successive
sipit
seemed
to
be
worthy
of
a
3
0
tops
at
first
but
it
kept
being
promoted
drinkability
at
first
i
thought
that
this
might
be
an
allnight
beer
on
further
reflection
though
id
say
that
one
or
two
would
be
my
limit
it
was
a
nice
brew
worth
the
cost
and
id
drink
it
again
and
recommend
it
to
friends
but
i
probably
wouldnt
serve
it
at
a
social
gathering
since
its
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
a
drinking
beer
im
confused
by
the
labels
the
terrapin
is
almost
a
teenage
mutant
ninja
but
dressed
as
executioner
on
hopsecutioner
here
the
countryboy
terrapin
of
the
rye
ale
marketing
is
a
little
off
to
me
but
what
do
i
know
im
not
from
georgia
but
just
passing
through
atlanta
label
reports
the
beer
was
brewed
at
flying
dog
very
good
a
tad
malty
but
good
overall
would
love
to
try
this
fresher
d
overall
a
great
session
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
convert
your
friends
to
craft
beer
very
newbie
friendly
but
still
damn
tasty
if
you
ask
me
cheers
to
millerbuffoon
for
hooking
me
up
im
craving
another
one
of
these
but
i
only
have
one
left
so
im
going
to
save
it
for
another
night
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
overall
but
nothing
special
the
rye
character
adds
interest
but
id
like
to
see
the
hops
come
through
a
little
more
assertively
i
would
go
out
and
seek
it
again
coming
off
the
cruise
ship
this
was
a
great
alternative
to
bud
light
by
three
pl
in
a
key
west
bar
this
pours
orange
and
has
some
sediment
the
head
is
one
finger
with
champagnelike
bubbles
it
goes
away
rather
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
really
unique
because
of
the
rye
the
whole
feel
of
this
beer
is
different
than
any
other
pale
ale
that
ive
had
which
makes
it
interesting
the
toasted
barely
flavor
is
replaced
by
a
bitter
sweet
rye
flavor
it
still
has
hop
presence
and
a
nice
mild
bite
that
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
which
isnt
so
unlike
other
pale
ales
that
ive
tasted
it
has
a
lighter
body
and
is
something
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
d
nice
balanced
beer
with
a
midrange
abv
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
summer
fall
or
spring
really
refreshing
with
a
clean
finish
great
drinkability
quite
an
easily
drinkable
beer
d
this
beer
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
which
at
times
in
the
industry
seems
to
be
a
miss
a
nice
lower
abv
seems
to
be
what
this
beer
is
i
could
drink
many
of
these
over
and
over
without
killing
my
palate
mthis
is
a
crisp
beer
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
seriously
interesting
taste
this
beer
breaths
a
lot
of
life
into
the
pale
ale
world
a
blast
to
drink
just
how
rye
whiskey
adds
spiciness
fruitiness
and
body
to
a
bourbon
the
rye
in
this
brew
really
rounds
out
the
typical
lean
pale
ale
style
and
makes
for
a
juicy
malty
and
very
tasty
brew
it
pours
a
brilliant
orangeamber
with
a
white
head
which
left
rather
quickly
and
has
a
rich
aroma
of
peach
pie
orange
and
pink
grapefruit
subdued
hops
on
the
nose
the
palate
is
bright
with
flavors
of
canteloupe
and
the
creamy
fruity
rye
character
adding
a
nice
bump
of
body
and
complexity
the
presentation
is
overall
round
while
the
finish
is
short
with
hints
of
apricots
and
honey
poured
ontap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
jacksonville
fl
the
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
and
serves
a
hazy
orangecopper
color
with
a
thin
dense
white
foamy
head
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
grain
and
hops
on
the
nose
but
very
subtle
the
flavor
is
grainy
but
with
a
heavy
dose
of
hops
very
well
balanced
flavors
tasting
almost
like
a
hopped
amber
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
with
a
crispness
from
the
carbonation
the
finish
is
quick
with
a
little
hop
residue
in
mouth
and
a
sweet
and
hoppy
afteratste
tasty
drinkability
the
hops
are
just
too
dry
and
dehydrating
not
refreshing
at
all
if
one
likes
lots
of
hops
this
beer
will
be
well
appreciated
otherwise
avoid
light
bodied
but
with
a
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
that
pricks
at
the
tongue
this
might
be
fairly
drinkable
pale
ale
if
not
for
the
metallic
aftertaste
and
carbonation
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
a
wonderful
brew
to
enjoy
in
the
great
city
of
atlanta
on
a
warm
summer
day
rye
is
something
of
an
afterthought
in
the
citrusy
and
toasty
nose
but
its
a
surprisingly
assertive
yet
complementary
flavor
crisp
and
toasty
with
a
refreshing
and
juicy
jolt
of
citrus
the
rye
gains
steam
as
it
warms
but
never
approaches
dominance
a
nice
take
on
the
apa
crisp
and
refreshing
but
with
a
challenging
element
easy
recommendation
drinking
wise
the
pale
ale
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
hoppy
or
not
hoppy
is
the
question
refreshing
i
bet
this
would
be
a
great
one
in
hot
weather
which
we
are
definitely
not
experiencing
in
february
in
new
hampshire
quite
nice
just
the
same
single
twelveounced
purchased
from
buy
rite
on
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
great
stuff
refreshing
and
satisfying
with
strong
rye
nuances
malts
and
hops
both
evident
with
notes
of
amber
grains
bread
butter
and
honey
mediumbodied
complex
and
flavorful
copperamber
hue
with
a
fullbodied
head
good
stuff
recommended
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
definitely
fell
short
of
my
expectations
i
come
from
the
land
of
reds
rye
where
rye
pales
are
delightfully
refreshing
and
packed
with
flavor
this
is
good
but
doesnt
even
compare
solid
brew
great
spin
on
an
apa
with
some
nice
rye
mixed
in
could
definitely
have
a
few
more
of
these
terrapin
rye
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
laces
nicely
smells
of
rye
hops
apricots
and
orange
peel
just
a
fantastic
rye
taste
that
doesnt
thinout
or
dissipate
as
so
many
others
do
the
rye
lingers
on
the
palate
and
is
a
delight
on
a
hot
day
carbonation
is
notably
more
pronounced
than
the
winter
brews
ive
been
enjoying
and
im
glad
for
it
goes
well
with
a
sunny
day
i
usually
have
a
one
beer
limit
but
this
stuff
always
tempts
me
to
drink
another
wellbalanced
and
very
nice
indeed
d
good
bre
with
interesting
and
delicious
flavors
that
are
well
represented
i
like
the
rye
malt
profile
and
the
smooth
hops
in
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
beer
is
a
too
watery
to
be
truly
great
if
it
were
less
watery
with
a
better
head
it
would
be
an
all
time
favorite
color
is
a
nice
golden
orange
much
like
an
iced
tea
very
little
head
after
pouring
citrus
scents
are
prominent
in
the
aroma
perhaps
leaning
toward
orange
hops
are
at
the
forefront
of
the
taste
but
not
overpowering
i
couldnt
pick
up
any
rye
taste
carbonation
was
just
right
a
very
enjoyable
ale
drinkability
goes
down
fairly
smooth
nice
kick
back
and
drink
beer
as
some
one
that
loves
pale
ales
this
is
still
quite
enjoyable
definitely
a
b
this
could
be
sooo
good
with
a
little
tweak
pours
a
nice
light
and
golden
color
with
a
moderate
amount
of
white
head
that
forms
up
at
first
then
sticks
around
and
provides
some
decent
lacing
smell
is
quite
grainy
some
hay
and
grass
notes
that
i
can
make
out
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
and
some
slight
slight
grapefruit
the
taste
is
what
makes
this
beer
it
starts
out
with
a
mild
and
bready
malt
sweetness
that
is
quite
dry
in
character
followed
by
a
touch
of
that
rye
spicy
kick
blended
in
with
a
bit
of
grainynuttiness
with
a
nice
and
balanced
piney
and
citrusy
hop
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
dry
finish
nothing
too
fancy
with
this
beer
but
definitely
sessionable
d
this
is
a
solid
goto
its
flavorful
widely
available
and
reasonably
priced
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
overall
is
a
nice
rye
pale
d
very
drinkable
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
pours
a
slightly
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
rye
and
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
and
maybe
some
grapefruit
tastes
like
a
little
malt
and
then
loads
of
bittering
hops
and
a
little
rye
bite
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
has
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
d
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
well
constructed
ale
not
afraid
in
the
least
to
say
this
one
impressed
me
id
love
to
drink
another
again
in
spring
i
just
felt
caged
drinking
it
in
an
ice
storm
i
would
absolutely
purchase
this
beer
again
and
it
would
pare
well
with
spicy
foods
especially
chicken
and
even
bbq
drinkabilty
this
was
an
easy
to
drink
brew
well
balanced
just
enough
hops
for
a
pale
ale
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
a
very
hoppy
nose
this
beer
was
pretty
tastyi
love
the
rye
taste
in
any
beer
and
this
beer
starts
with
some
grapefruitpine
hops
before
the
spicy
rye
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
pepper
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
i
didnt
think
the
hops
quite
stood
up
to
the
ryeit
seemed
a
little
unbalanced
to
mebut
it
was
definitely
an
excellent
american
pale
ale
a
really
tasty
take
on
the
style
this
ale
poured
a
light
copper
color
and
a
finger
of
white
head
leaving
a
lace
ring
on
my
pint
glass
some
faint
floral
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
but
getting
alot
more
malt
aromas
than
expected
not
really
picking
up
any
rye
scents
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
some
sweeter
malts
upfront
that
are
accompanied
with
the
aforementioned
hops
with
somewhat
spicy
rye
malt
finish
medium
bodied
with
proper
carbonation
drinkabilty
at
first
sip
i
would
have
thought
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
any
one
sitting
but
the
more
i
savored
it
the
more
i
realized
that
one
or
two
would
be
more
in
my
drinking
range
the
use
of
rye
makes
this
an
interesting
take
on
a
pale
ale
and
would
certainly
drink
another
if
only
i
had
another
not
my
finest
beeroem
but
it
works
after
having
a
few
that
evening
nicely
drinkable
though
just
a
hair
on
the
bitterprickly
side
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
book
all
and
all
a
good
beer
nothing
worth
seeking
out
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
presence
up
front
that
is
quickly
countered
by
a
sweet
caramel
rye
malt
backbone
nicely
balanced
with
hints
of
grass
straw
and
nut
dry
bitter
hop
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
though
the
rye
is
not
quite
as
pronounced
as
i
was
hoping
id
get
it
again
overall
carbonation
definitely
needs
ramped
up
because
right
after
this
one
i
had
terrapin
hopsecutioner
and
no
carbonation
problems
in
that
beer
i
dont
think
rye
beers
are
for
everyone
but
this
one
grew
on
me
would
have
again
d
i
like
the
idea
of
this
beer
i
think
a
bit
more
rye
presence
and
more
carbonation
would
have
moved
this
beer
up
quite
a
bit
for
me
this
being
said
the
strong
hop
character
may
be
the
reason
that
the
rye
didnt
show
through
d
a
very
sessionable
american
pale
ale
quite
refreshing
the
rye
adds
a
certain
complexity
that
will
keeps
this
terrapin
offering
that
i
will
gladly
revisit
on
occasion
above
average
but
far
from
world
class
this
is
just
a
solid
all
around
brew
high
drinkability
one
is
definitely
not
enough
but
thats
all
that
i
have
very
impressive
for
a
bottle
pale
ale
i
really
like
this
better
than
i
can
remember
it
served
fresh
on
tap
kind
of
odd
drinkability
try
as
i
might
i
cant
find
a
reason
to
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
anything
special
d
very
high
drinkability
one
is
definitely
not
enough
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
golden
tones
a
light
head
is
reduced
to
a
fresh
collar
smell
is
hops
and
malt
a
little
spice
and
bread
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
light
hops
in
the
tone
of
grapefruitslight
mango
and
floral
its
followed
by
a
wisp
of
rye
mixed
in
with
some
caramel
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
tasty
with
just
the
right
carbonation
this
is
a
great
and
slightly
different
pa
loved
the
rye
although
slight
amount
in
the
mix
with
the
hops
and
malts
try
this
on
for
sure
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
spice
in
the
finish
and
it
just
lingers
on
the
tongue
this
really
hits
the
spot
d
one
of
the
most
unique
pale
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
if
youre
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
this
may
not
be
your
brew
however
it
would
be
tough
to
argue
that
this
is
your
average
runofthemill
drinker
im
really
looking
forward
to
getting
more
of
these
this
could
be
a
staple
beer
for
me
its
drinkable
and
simple
on
top
of
being
delicious
overall
i
was
kinda
disappointed
with
this
just
tasted
watered
down
and
flavorless
sorry
terrapin
i
still
love
ya
overall
the
best
local
atlanta
beer
that
i
have
had
and
i
will
get
some
more
to
continue
taste
testing
d
a
nice
sessionable
pale
ale
hops
could
be
played
up
a
bit
more
but
the
rye
keeps
it
interesting
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
quite
tasty
if
this
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
it
would
be
outstanding
but
even
with
a
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
disappointed
a
bit
it
is
still
a
very
solid
apa
the
beer
is
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
carbonation
you
can
taste
but
fades
away
leaving
the
hops
i
found
the
beer
very
drinkable
i
will
buy
again
pours
a
nice
light
goldencopper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
down
some
citrus
hops
as
well
as
a
bit
of
rye
spice
the
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
a
good
deal
of
citrus
and
hints
of
pine
a
bit
spicy
nice
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
levels
and
some
nice
zest
drinks
quite
well
a
really
nice
hot
weather
brew
excellent
season
drinker
one
of
my
goto
beers
it
is
their
use
of
hops
that
makes
this
so
good
it
is
well
balanced
and
drinkable
moreish
the
alcohol
level
is
not
out
of
drinkability
range
either
it
just
qualifies
for
session
status
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
rye
beers
in
the
future
tasted
from
bottle
obtained
in
a
trade
pours
light
orange
with
a
faint
hint
of
amber
also
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
fairly
heavy
lace
the
nose
is
floral
hops
and
citrus
including
lemon
and
orange
there
are
also
some
nice
malt
notes
i
typically
enjoy
ryebased
beers
the
beer
is
fairly
simple
up
front
displaying
some
of
the
fruitier
citrus
notes
well
and
then
moving
into
some
nice
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
then
that
awesome
rye
malt
kicks
in
and
melds
nicely
with
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
body
and
carbonation
are
fairly
light
with
a
nice
finish
that
balances
malt
and
hops
very
well
d
eh
basically
a
standard
albeit
slightly
bland
apa
with
a
kiss
of
rye
light
bodied
to
the
point
of
almost
being
a
chore
after
a
full
glass
d
a
good
beer
refreshing
with
a
light
citrus
crispness
db
a
well
balanced
easy
going
beer
the
label
kind
of
goes
with
the
beer
in
a
way
relaxing
and
smooth
a
beer
with
a
nice
malt
and
hop
presence
that
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
this
is
a
very
solid
pale
but
not
alot
of
risks
i
would
have
preferred
just
a
bit
more
body
this
is
a
very
good
apa
and
the
rye
is
pulled
off
nicely
id
certainly
be
up
for
trying
it
again
d
overall
an
average
rye
pa
drinkable
but
not
real
memorable
the
beer
pours
absolutely
translucent
and
its
darker
than
tangerine
but
not
quite
a
true
orange
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
foam
rise
up
but
disappear
a
little
too
quickly
lacing
is
solid
though
as
i
make
my
way
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
equal
parts
bready
malts
spicy
and
floral
english
type
hops
guessed
ekg
were
in
the
mix
before
checking
terrapins
site
and
that
distinct
sharp
spiciness
i
always
get
from
beers
that
include
rye
malt
its
a
little
weak
though
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
im
having
a
really
hard
time
finding
the
amarillo
that
rye
pale
ale
was
supposedly
dry
hopped
with
a
nice
crack
of
hop
bite
from
the
magnum
marks
the
transition
from
the
definitely
present
malt
sweetness
to
the
aforementioned
hop
and
rye
flavors
the
body
is
nice
a
little
bit
richer
than
i
might
have
anticipated
but
it
works
with
this
beer
carbonation
is
a
little
too
highprickly
for
my
tastes
but
the
key
word
there
is
little
a
solid
presence
balances
out
the
hops
and
rye
and
makes
this
a
greatly
sessionable
beer
solid
offering
from
terrapin
though
ive
seen
them
do
better
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
thin
veil
of
white
head
that
goes
fast
a
vague
aroma
of
hops
citrus
wet
grass
and
a
hop
spiciness
a
pleasant
drink
light
hops
citrus
grass
some
spice
a
strange
rye
characteristic
towards
the
end
and
then
vague
lemon
afterthoughts
light
in
body
and
in
carbonation
a
light
pale
ale
that
sprinkles
some
great
flavors
across
the
palate
but
some
weird
notes
as
well
if
you
see
this
ontap
buy
it
what
a
perfect
college
football
session
choice
this
would
be
im
not
a
huge
pale
ale
drinker
but
a
friend
of
mine
gave
me
a
bottle
yesterday
a
typical
copper
pale
ale
with
bubbles
from
being
force
carbonated
s
i
was
suprized
to
find
some
bready
malty
aroma
balancing
the
hops
as
apposed
to
most
apas
that
just
smell
like
cascade
hop
soda
real
nice
full
nose
t
again
it
had
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
lots
of
nice
bready
rye
and
tastey
hop
fruit
and
spice
not
to
much
bitterness
either
just
what
an
apa
should
be
malty
without
being
rich
hoppy
without
being
bitter
m
a
little
thin
but
nice
and
drinkable
d
perfectly
quaffable
apears
a
sorta
hazy
orange
golden
color
with
nice
white
head
12
thick
that
leaves
a
decent
lacing
the
two
expected
aromas
rye
and
hops
are
definitely
in
there
the
flavor
is
rye
with
a
little
hops
bit
but
still
very
well
balanced
medium
carbonation
and
body
pretty
drinkable
all
around
decent
beer
overall
delivers
on
exactly
what
it
promises
a
pale
ale
made
with
rye
clean
crisp
just
enough
bitterness
to
make
it
complex
but
not
overthetop
or
an
ipa
an
easily
overlooked
but
solid
offering
from
terrapin
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
a
comparible
to
founders
rye
pale
and
it
just
does
not
compare
it
is
a
fairly
average
beer
the
hops
are
mild
and
the
rye
is
very
mild
it
pours
a
soft
golden
color
with
a
light
head
it
is
light
in
body
and
easy
to
drink
but
light
in
flavor
and
hops
as
well
id
tag
it
as
a
safe
beer
to
serve
when
entertaining
da
pretty
nice
beer
thats
easy
drinking
but
still
interesting
the
rye
is
pretty
perceivable
but
i
think
id
like
it
to
have
just
a
little
more
hop
flavor
bottle
pours
a
very
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
along
with
smelling
sweet
this
is
an
intersing
american
pale
ale
more
malty
in
my
opinion
that
hoppy
well
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
not
really
sure
what
role
the
rye
plays
or
if
i
really
can
taste
it
all
that
much
but
i
will
say
that
i
am
enjoying
this
one
decent
bitter
hop
ending
d
a
very
good
and
refreshing
beer
and
would
definately
drink
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
small
but
clingy
head
aromas
are
interesting
theres
definitely
a
hop
element
on
the
nose
but
the
dominant
trait
is
remeniscent
of
a
woodpile
toffee
notes
are
also
there
on
the
palate
im
getting
strong
flavors
of
toasted
english
muffins
and
some
toffee
finishes
quick
and
clean
with
a
light
hint
of
lingering
malts
that
dash
of
malted
rye
makes
a
world
of
difference
and
makes
this
an
exceptially
satisfying
pale
ale
i
really
love
this
brew
it
pours
to
a
nice
dark
golden
color
it
smells
grain
and
hops
the
hops
being
the
main
thing
that
rings
out
to
me
excellent
tasting
beer
with
a
light
bodied
mouth
feel
which
maks
for
superior
drinkability
i
would
defintley
advise
trying
the
rye
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
really
good
rye
pale
ale
ive
really
enjoyed
the
terrapin
beers
that
i
found
on
my
trip
to
nc
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
a
bite
of
stern
carbonation
levels
off
into
surprising
smoothness
leaving
only
a
strong
bitterness
d
an
ok
pale
i
just
didnt
enjoy
how
the
malts
turned
sour
halfway
through
fairly
sessionable
drinkabilitythis
is
a
very
pleasant

i
really
like
this
beer
had
it
on

a
couple
of
times

i
was
down

would
love
some
more
of
this
served

pours
golden

the
flavor
was
of

wheat
nutty
with
a
subtle
hop
followthrough
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
was
not
my
favorite
from
terrapin
it
was
very
refreshing
in
flavor
it
needs
a
more
refined
ryewheat
flavor
to
standout
in
my
opinion
however
this
is
a
very
nice
brew

brew
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
the
next
time
i
come
across
it
overall
there
is
just
something
about
rye
that
i
dont
care
for
although
i
can
easily
drink
this
and
could
have
another
it
leaves
such
a
dryness
on
my
tongue
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
too
many
in
a
night
that
being
said
its
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
quite
drinkable
might
pick
up
a
full
case
of
this
some
time
more
body
than
we
expected
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
this
beer
has
character
to
it
and
shows
that
it
is
not
one
of
your
runofthemill
boring
pale
ales
d
a
great
blend
and
fusion
of
rye
and
hops
delivers
a
very
quaffable
and
sharply
tuned
pale
that
satisfies
all
you
hop
and
ryemalt
needs
rolled
into
one
highly
drinkable
six
pack
recommended
and
very
interesting
indeed
overall
better
than
it
sounds
pours
a
honey
straw
color
with
a
small
tight
white
head
that
settles
into
a
light
cap
on
the
light
side
for
a
apa
the
aroma
is
of
a
floral
and
grassy
hop
to
go
along
with
a
lemony
caramel
malt
quite
pale
the
taste
is
of
a
dry
bready
pale
malt
with
notes
of
honey
and
lemon
the
hops
dont
seem
to
stand
out
in
the
flavor
a
bit
grassy
but
that
is
about
it
the
feel
is
moderate
with
tingly
carbonation
finishes
a
tad
dry
and
astringent
a
solid
apa
nothing
fantastic
actually
it
has
a
nice
malt
body
but
needs
a
touch
more
of
a
flavorful
hop
profile
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
probably
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
good
flavor
combined
with
a
good
presentation
leave
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
liked
it
d
not
a
bad
beer
just
my
least
favorite
of
this
style
that
ive
had
i
wish
the
rye
was
highlightedshowcased
more
the
bark
is
better
than
the
bite
to
be
sure
i
really
enjoy
a
alpine
nelson
or
sixpoint
righteous
rye
for
this
style
more
aggressive
with
the
rye
d
with
crisp
and
very
clean
malts
dominating
the
beer
this
one
would
be
one
of
the
first
beers
i
reach
for
if
im
looking
to
polish
of
a
full
6er
in

d

very
sessionable

understated
in
its
flavor
not
tiring
to
the
tastebuds
but
still
flavorful
and
refreshing
this
brew
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
slim
head
nearly
no
lace
the
aroma
is
nice
however
with
a
very
breadlike
malt
and
grain
character
moderate
rye
aroma
with
a
gristlike
graininess
in
the
background
earthy
scents
with
a
hint
of
breadcrust
and
an
omnipresent
herbal
hop
scent
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
a
decidedly
bitter
finish
the
bitterness
really
kicks
in
by
the
midtaste
and
lingers
long
after
the

for

pretty
good
but
the
nose
is
not

awesome
as
most
apas
but
is
very
drinkable
just
not
memorable
its
taken
me
far
too
long
to
try
this
stuff
so
lucky
me
that
beelows
just
happened
to
tap
this
one
as
their
three
floyds
rotator
recently
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cantaloupe
bright
grapefruit
white
grape
honey
peach
and
passion
fruit
feel
the
fruit
salad
the
taste
takes
a
slightly
different
path
opting
for
grapefruit
zest
mild
orange
peel
light
greens
and
mild
honeyladen
biscuit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
pretty
durn
nice
pale
ale
though
the
smell
writes
a
bombastic
check
the
only
good
flavors
cant
quite
cash
that
being
said
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
plenty
more
of
these
if
given
the
opportunity
the
aroma
is
incredible
beautiful
apricot
soft
sweetness
beautiful
hops
lovely
so
much
fruit
sour
fruit
this
is
also
the
taste
sweet
lightly
sour
apricot
a
little
dry
with
a
brief
aftertaste
incredible
pale
ale
not
bad
for
a
session
but
i
expect
more
from
fff
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
mouthwatering
session
ale
that
pours
light
drinks
light
but
has
excellent
flavor
mouthfeel
and
a
wonderful
noseslightly
complex
for
the
style
but
still
straightforward
o
they
were
already
the
kings
of
american
pale
ales
and
have
added
a
very
good
session
ale
to
go
along
with
the
gushing
flavor
giants
they
already
have
they
continue
to
evolve
into
the
best
there
is
and
if
they
can
get
their
beer
into
all
their
markets
on
a
more
regular
basis
i
wouldnt
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
them
but
as
of
right
now
there
just
isnt
enough
or
even
close
to
enough
fff
hitting
our
shelves
like
there
was
2
years

everything
3

does
is

poured
from

this
is

beer
to
me
it
didnt
taste
anything
like
it
smelled
the
carmellike
back
end
and
aftertaste
on
this
beer
put
me
in
mind
of
country
boys
galaxy
pale
ale
which
i
didnt
like
at
all
im
not
saying
this
beer
is
bad
but
i
can
see
similarities
regarding
the
hop
and
malt
profiles
this
beer
is
much
more
balanced
and
wellrounded
and
while
im
a
huge
fan
of
3f
ill
probabaly
pass
on
this
beer
in
the
future
unless
its
all
i
can
get
three
floyds
yumyum

decently
hoppy
brew
with
a

it

easy
drinker

burgers
and
wings
what
more
can
you
ask
for
overall
another

product
not
as
overly
hoppy
as

on

not
your

apa
for
sure
but
a
nice
offering
for
a
change
of
pace
had
it
on
tap
at
kumas
in
chicago
not
impressed
bizarre
malty
breadlike
aftertaste
takes
away
from
the
hop
profile
almost
tasted
like
it
came
from
a
bad
tap
line
not
the
best
offering
from
the
usually
stellar
3
floyds
i
have
a
feeling
youll
be
able
to
find
this
one
in
stores
easily
not
so
much
everything
else
they
make
worst
of
their
everyday
offerings
but
still
a
good
beer
felt
like
this
was
the
best
grain
bill
in
a
fffs
hoppy
beer
not
as
hoppy
or
with
the
body
of
zd
but
a
great
pale
ale
nice
levels
on
this
one
a
very
good
session
beer
for
the
hoplovers
this
is
some
pretty
good
beer
i
thought
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
fff
i
think
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
unique
fruity
character
in
the
aroma
and
tase
you
will
love
it
it
was
all
fruit
through
and
through
and
i
thought
there
was
just
enough
malt
to
let
it
stay
present
but
over
not
overpower
reminded
me
of
a
fruit
stripe
stick
of
gum
but
in
a
good
way
just
overall
not
a
fan
thought
this
one
missed
its
mark
and
to
hear
its
taking
over
for
pride
n
joy
as
a
year
round
i
think
is
silly
this
one
had
a
strange
sweetness
that
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
had
at
chicago
s
local
option
on
tap
clear
golden
pour
with
a
white
head
delicious
grapefruit
undertones
overall
the
overall
profile
is
that
of
a
weakened
apa
i
will
take
regular
over
unleaded
great
taste
i
felt
better
than

within

pale
nice
golden
hue
on

forward
feel
beer
is
lacking
flavor
is
off
not
bad
a
little
bit
light
for
my
high
abv
taste
buds
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
alright
everything
is
inline
just
not
for
winter
drinking
especially
drinking
right
after
a
on
the
wings
of
armageddon
like
zombie
dust
light
even
better
aroma
than
zombie
dust
very
sessionable
great
with
ramen
if
this
beer
was
accessible
in
california
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
regularly
especially
in
the
summer
months
light
on
the
palate
without
compromising
flavor
no
cloying
sweetness
or
heaviness
just
a
crisp
drinkable
ale
from
3
floyds
not
the
best
pa
ive
had
but
pretty
awesome
none
the
less
excellent
example
of
the
style
nice
citruspine
aroma
which
is
borne
out
in
the
taste
though
the
hops
are
very
forward
this
beer
has
an
excellent
malty
body
that
balances
the
beer
beautifully
no
excessive
bitterness
just
a
delicious
very
drinkable
beer
if
this
was
available
where
i
live
it
would
be
in
the
regular
rotation
nice
add
on
to
the
bottle
line
three
floyds
its
goodgreat
if
i
werent
judging
it
against
three
floyds
illustrious
lineupbut
i
am
still
not
sure
it
justifies
removing
the
very
underrated
pride
joy
from
the
regular
rotation
well
see
ive
got
three
more
sixes
in
my
case
so
theres
ample
volume
to
further
ascertain
taste
tangy
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
with
a
spicy
bitter
feel
i
also
get
some
toffee
malts
clinging
on
underneath
but
this
ones
really
all
about
the
hops
proprietary
hops
here
mean
a
new
strain
maybe
its
definitely
a
unique
take
on
an
american
session
ale
or
american
pale
ale
hops
fiends
rejoice
here
is
another
winner
from
3f
overall
another
damn
good
apa
from
3f
o
more
than
a
light
beer
with
hops
it
has
body
o
a
great
apa
not
as
good
as
alpha
king
but
still
good
nonetheless

overall
good

i
really
dig

something
about
it
feels
a
little
not
pc
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
notpc
its
just
an
interesting
design
and
id
love
to
hear
the
story
behind
it
im
thinking
it
involves
several
beers
and
maybe
some
doobies
16
oz
pint
on
draft
at
the
brewery
o
good
beer
and
fun
to
try
but
if
im

its
going
to
be

golden

creamy

nicely

citrus
hoppy

another
strong
addition
to
the
three
floyds
lineup
will
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
delicious
this
stuff
is
like
juicy
fruit
in
your
mouth
mildly
bitter
little
malty
but
so
easy
drinking
this
is
now
my
favorite
session
cant
think
of
anything
i
would
change
just
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
pale
offering
from
three
floyds
they
obviously
specialize
in
this
style
of
beer
and
here
you
are
gifted
a
nicely
tropical
fruity
and
airy
beverage
the
hop
to
malt
balance
was
well
maintained
although
the
grain
bill
seemed
to
push
back
a
bit
more
than
your
typical
apa
yumyum
however
is
certainly
not
their
best
by
any
means
but
the
juiciness
is
unmistakable
one
oddity
that
we
did
happen
to
note
was
this
buttery
popcorn
seed
aroma
and
flavoring
this
added
a
curious
slick
oily
dirtiness
to
both
of
those
aspects
of
the
beer
tending
to
ruddy
it
up
a
bit
into
what
we
would
coin
as
a
farmhouse
pale
ale
if
we
could
it
is
just
that
dirty
and
grassy
giving
this
very
organic
and
very
downhome
feel
to
it
a
bit
weak
and
thin
this
is
a
truly
amazing
pale
ale
a
friend
of
mine
went
for
a
hike
near
golden
and
found
some
hops
growing
wild
being
the
prolific
homebrewer
he
is
he
brewed
a
number
of
beers
with
the
hops
but
neither
of
us
could
identify
them
they
has
a
chili
pepper
nose
a
cantaloupe
melon
character
and
a
pineapple
even
peanutty
vibe
its
so
weird
that
all
his
beers
got
tasted
this
week
and
this
thing
fell
into
my
lap
i
swear
the
hops
are
the
same
maybe
its
not
a
new
varietal
at
all
but
a
rediscovered
old
wild
vine
thats
sure
what
it
feels
like
brassy
hazy
beer
killer
carbonation
and
head
and
a
nose
that
does
absolutely
no
justice
to
how
interesting
these
hops
are
its
juicy
and
has
note
of
melon
and
lemon
cream
and
indeed
that
faint
chili
pepper
character
i
dont
know
what
this
hops
is
but
i
need
more
of
it
my
only
critique
of
this
beer
is
its
label
calling
it
a
session
ale
i
mean
it
is
i
would
drink
ten
of
these
if
i
had
them
tonight
but
i
consider
a
session
ale
under
5
abv
thats
my
line
self
declared
but
i
stand
by
it
its
just
a
pale
ale
but
its
not
just
a
pale
ale
as
vibrant
and
unique
as
any
hoppy
beer
going
right
now
this
is
absolutely
brilliant
thanks
to
claystation
for
giving
me
this
but
im
afraid
he
doesnt
realize
what
he
has
given
up
this
is
killer
really
really
good
someone
tell
me
more
about
the
hops
blueberry
light
caramel
strawberry
pine
light
wheat
light
honey
taste
is
similarly
mild
plenty
of
pale
malt
to
back
up
the
citrus
and
floral
hop
notes
doesnt
really
seem
characteristic
of
fff
but
is
definitely
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
light
bodied
and
smooth
kind
of
sad
to
lose
pride
joy
for
this
to
be
honest
o
an
easily
drinkable
flavor
forward
apa
ill
miss
pride
joy
which
was
more
reserved
but
this
is
a
distinctive
three
floyds
brew
a
huge
beer
that
still
things
balanced
tried
this
at
haymarket
it
was
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
pale
ale
overall
theres
alot
i
think
is
very
outstanding
about
this
brew
the
appearance
the
aroma
and
the
way
if
feels
on
my
palate
yet
the
flavor
isnt
bringing
anything
new
to
me
is
it
balanced
yes
very
its
just
a
bit
laggish
and
lacking
the
brightness
that
i
get
in
the
aroma
dont
think
im
bashing
this
brew
far
from
it
i
was
just
expecting
maybe
too
much
from
this
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
brew
is
worthy
nowadays
theres
a
slew
of
beers
in
all
parts
of
the
world
being
made
with
galaxies
full
of
new
hop
varieties
in
the
last
couple
weeks
alone
ive
come
across
beers
featuring
hop
breeds
i
cant
even
pronounce
produced
in
scotland
germany
and
canada
and
truthfully
yumyum
doesnt
stand
out
among
them
as
anything
especially
noteworthy
but
if
were
talking
hoppy
beers
theres
still
few
better
breweries
than
three
floyds
and
arguably
no
better
producer
nation
than
america
o
wow
well
done
not
zd
but
really
holds
its
own
against
many
apas
and
ipas
a
lovely
crushable
beer
i
liked
it
more
than
i
thought
was
thinking
a
light
bodied
hop
bomb
instead
i
got
a
sweet
well
balanced
pale
ale
a
dull
shade
of
orange
yellow
in
color
forms
a
moderate
sized
fluffy
offtan
colored
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
rather
pungent
and
hopforward
aroma
is
mostly
citrus
and
citrus
zest
with
an
underlying
fruitiness
the
taste
follows
up
on
the
aroma
there
is
a
mild
caramel
back
bone
neither
sweet
nor
dry
then
there
is
some
tropical
fruit
along
with
bright
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
to
round
things
out
medium
bodied
mild
to
medium
bitterness
appropriate
carbonation
another
fine
apa
from
fff
that
has
no
chance
of
staying
on
the
shelves
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
09302014
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
a
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
floral
and
citrusy
grapefruit
tropical
fruit
hops
and
some
breadygrainy
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
melon
and
orange
peel
noticeable
the
brew
has
a
nice
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
smooth
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
thought
this
was
good
certainly
worth
picking
up
if
you
come
across
some
2
19
a
single
bottle
tmo
really
smooth
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
a
nice
hop
presence
but
no
doubt
a
pale
ale
a
little
less
aggressive
than
a
zombie
dust
but
still
has
a
nice
hop
the
sweet
biscuity
malt
balances
it
all
out
to
make
one
hell
of
a
session
pale
truth
in
advertising
this
beer
is
yum
yum
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
great
session
ale
if
you
want
fuller
flavor
from
your
pales
you
might
look
towards
snpa
or
alpha
king
but
i
like
this
quite
a
lot
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
i
cant
emphasize
that
enough
and
it
is
worlds
better
than
pride
and
joy
bottled
a
week
ago
so
should
be
fresh
resin
dank
marijuana
and
catty
hops
dominate
with
a
soft
tropical
fruit
aroma
underneath
notes
of
mango
and
pineapple
accompany
zesty
grapefruit
and
lemon
tons
of
hop
aroma
flavor
reveals
fruity
hops
at
the
base
becoming
resiny
and
lightly
bitter
in
the
finish
soft
mango
and
orange
zest
accompany
light
grapefruit
tartness
i
like
that
the
fruity
hop
character
dominates
most
session
ales
are
too
bitter
and
resiny
for
my
palate
get
it
drink
it
savor
it
yep
balanced
until
deep
within
its
finish
the
ales
bitterness
is
smooth
and
softly
of
spruce
and
botanical
grasses
and
herbs
a
crisp
clean
and
clear
exit
from
the
palate
ensures
a
high
rate
of
refreshment
from
the
mediumlight
ale
yet
a
suggestion
of
buttered
and
salted
graham
cracker
is
peculiarly
satisfying
this
is
a
nice
unique
take
on
the
style
its
different
from
alot
of
fffs
hoppy
beers
but
still
showcases
what
they
can
do
with
hops
nice
brew
another
in
the
line
of
heavily
hopped
pale
ales
although
not
nearly
as
extreme
as
some
california
examples
looks
beautiful
with
plenty
of
head
on
the
pour
and
copious
lace
golden
amber
with
a
fair
amount
of
haze
aroma
and
taste
speak
to
the
hops
while
the
malt
backbone
is
solid
enough
the
tropical
hops
are
what
catch
your
attention
perhaps
not
as
in
your
face
as
a
typical
west
coast
ipa
yum
yum
is
hops
first
and
malt
second
where
it
is
more
pale
ale
than
ipa
the
finish
is
less
bitter
and
more
short
lived
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
and
the
body
is
medium
fruity
and
piney
hops
dominate
near
medium
bitterness
overall
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
this
one
again
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
try
it
pours
straw
golden
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
big
fluffy
2
finger
white
head
that
retains
nicely
smell
has
a
really
fresh
hop
aroma
with
notes
of
herbal
hops
fresh
melon
and
hints
of
strawberry
and
blueberry
aromas
taste
follows
the
nose
with
more
herbal
hops
melon
and
berry
flavors
and
a
pretty
big
herbal
hop
bitterness
very
light
grain
flavor
lets
the
hops
shine
mouthfeel
is
crisp
refreshing
then
persistently
bitter
well
after
the
swallow
it
took
me
4
of
these
before
i
really
enjoyed
it
separate
occasions
not
sure
why
but
the
5th
and
6th
were
super
tasty
o
this
says
session
ale
on
the
bottle
but
to
me
it
was
better
than
most
of
the
other
session
ipas
ive
had
it
definitely
drinks
like
a
very
hop
forward
apa
ill
miss
pride
and
joy
being
easily
accessible
but
this
was
a
very
tasty
substitute
yum
yum
o
shoulda
gotten
another
pint
of
zd
instead
of
this
this
one
was
a
letdown
for
a
3floyds
hoppy
beer
i
like
this
better
than
all
day
but
not
other
stuff
like
go
to
or
daytime
i
love
the
folks
at
fff
that
said
not
every
beer
they
make
is
a
winner
folks
if
any
other
brewery
made
this
beer
theyd
be
lucky
if
it
made
it
to
an
80
overall
and
you
guys
arent
fooling
anyone
5
5
is
only
session
beer
if
youre
an
alcoholic
verdict
a
very
nice
session
ale
from
three
floyds
not
quite
as
rounded
and
thorough
as
others
on
the
market
boulevards
session
ale
still
rings
the
truest
for
me
as
a
session
ipa
but
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
last
remnants
of
summer
crisp
refreshing
and
light
but
bitter
and
hoppy
to
satisfy
i
think
that
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
here
but
ill
have
no
issues
crushing
this
6
pack
over
the
weekend
o
an
other
awesome
beer
from
fff
has
a
great
sweetness
that
is
well
balanced
by
the
hops
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
o
one
of
the
top
23
session
ipas
ive
had
enjoyable
at
5
5
this
is
on
the
higher
side
of
a
session
abv
something
like
a
passion
fruit
smell
in
the
nose
is
my
first
take
backed
up
by
some
citrus
mango
and
faint
lemon
but
i
almost
get
something
like
grape
in
it
too
taste
has
some
bitterness
abiding
the
ride
down
some
tartness
and
pucker
from
the
hopping
that
is
loosely
balanced
by
the
malt
and
backed
up
with
a
nice
bite
of
bitterness
a
nice
break
from
what
we
have
come
to
expect
and
probably
will
go
down
as
an
excellent
summer
drinker
and
yum
yum
does
its
job
well
of
being
a
sessionable
beer
that
very
unfortunately
does
not
list
its
abv
on
the
packaging
at
5
5
or
whatever
it
actually
is
its
not
exactly
a
true
session
ale
of
the
kind
you
can
keep
the
glass
running
at
half
full
for
the
day
but
its
pretty
tasty
and
worthy
of
some
dead
animal
perched
in
between
some
bread
and
for
getting
a
shine
on
with
and
yes
the
label
art
work
is
top
notch
and
hilarious
for
a
refreshing
pale
ale
this
beer
packs
a
hoppy
citrus
punch
that
is
not
overly
abusive
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
hopthirst
quenching
bitterness
thats
hard
to
beat
this
isnt
zombie
dust
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
earth
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
simple
in
my
opinion
golden
orangeish
slight
haze
and
a
decent
head
smells
like
a
straight
up
midwest
ipa
rounded
biscuit
malt
alpha
hops
tastes
sweet
sharp
and
spicy
strange
hop
profile
not
quite
like
anything
ive
had
round
thick
back
end
o
i
really
like
this
beer
but
not
quite
as
much
as
zombie
dust
or
alpha
king
overall
fantastic
session
pale
ale
very
similar
hops
to
zombie
dust
i
was
just
happy
this
was
still
on
draft
when
i
got
there
bright
golden
body
with
a
two
finger
white
foamy
head
theres
a
bit
of
sweet
citrus
on
the
nose
but
it
really
isnt
too
pungeant
the
taste
is
explosive
sweet
and
bitter
citrus
peel
and
citrus
juice
i
had
to
ask
if
my
tastebuds
were
correct
and
indeed
they
confirmed
that
this
is
mosaic
hopped
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
slick
with
a
little
resin
the
malt
is
there
for
balance
but
it
really
steers
clear
to
me
its
all
about
showcasing
mosaic
hops
and
that
was
certainly
done
i
still
like
annica
a
little
better
but
im
very
happy
to
see
a
sessionable
apa
use
of
this
hop
well
done
floyds
well
done
o
really
nice
new
pale
ale
by
three
floyds
looking
forward
to
seeing
if
they
decide
to
start
putting
this
into
six
packs
tried
this
at
the
brew
pub
more
akin
to
zombie
dust
i
hope
they
keep
this
one
around
and
start
bottling
it
because
i
was
blown
away
better
than
gumball
head
pride
n
joy
and
jinx
proof
another
amazing
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
it
has
joined
the
elites
such
as
apw
permanent
funeral
zd
and
alpha
king
in
terms
of
ales
pours
nice
has
a
distinct
smell
not
bad
bit
not
great
nice
head
but
doesnt
last
i
like
it
has
its
own
unique
appel
i
would
steer
clear
of
this
one
trust
me
youll
be
able
to
live
without
it
so
the
american
mild
ale
is
a
new
concept
is
that
basically
a
more
malt
driven
session
beer
logically
i
would
say
so
but
this
isnt
that
its
hoppy
as
heck
more
of
an
american
pale
than
anything
else
so
a
little
weird
to
tackle
conceptually
although
especially
easy
to
drink
down
clear
in
looks
but
rather
copper
or
amber
or
brass
colored
for
a
pale
mild
ale
its
not
english
in
any
way
and
even
though
they
make
the
distinction
its
sort
of
weird
to
think
about
what
a
mild
ale
is
outside
of
that
context
bright
hoppiness
not
dissimilar
to
other
beers
that
these
guys
make
its
bitter
and
clean
too
malty
but
light
a
bunch
of
fun
contradictions
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
average
by
three
floyds
standards
and
not
way
off
from
a
light
american
pale
ale
with
decent
balance
cool
beer
a
slugger
from
the
bottle
but
not
where
some
of
the
others
are
i
dont
think
in
terms
of
being
one
of
a
kind
so
mild
ales
should
honor
their
namesake
but
this
one
is
a
little
bit
too
mild
overall
bright
crisp
effervescent
and
quaffable
but
there
isnt
much
flavor
to
be
found
in
this
beer
completely
flat
characters
with
both
the
malt
and
hops
brilliant
packaging
as
always
though
o
this
beer
is
aptly
described
as
a
mild
its
not
anything
the
least
of
all
is
impressive
not
sure
why
they
bothered
making
it
this
is
a
really
good
easy
drinking
beer
really
smooth
and
refreshing
but
with
a
lot
of
mild
complex
flavors
fruity
mild
very
drinkable
f
3
75
good
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
nothing
blowing
me
away
but
solid
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
a
good
more
session
style
brew
just
a
beautiful
lite
beer
ogreat
session
ale
but
somewhat
pricey
this
one
will
be
missed
overall
not
bad
eric
o
an
excellent
beer
by
fff
another
winner
to
say
the
least
first
real
go
at
a
fff
brew
on
tap
at
our
somewhat
local
pourhouse
vintage
estate
this
was
bright
crisp
and
refreshing
poured
a
nice
amber
hue
with
some
longlasting
white
head
some
fruity
and
floral
hops
on
the
nose
and
crisp
bitterness
and
just
enough
sweet
malty
goodness
to
balance
it
all
out
nice
choice
for
a
lower
abv
pale
especially
good
when
looking
after
3
kids
on
the
ride
home
cant
wait
to
try
more
fff
a
light
and
sessionable
easy
drinking
beer
o
id
call
this
a
good
and
drinkable
session
ale
pretty
decent
mild
pale
ale
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
three
floyds
beer
had
it
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
bowling
green
almost
a
session
beer
reasonably
low
booziness
and
some
pretty
good
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hops
grassy

pours
a
goldish
yellow
good
color
not
bad
serving
type
bottle
easy
drinker
taste
very
similar
to
zombie
dust
very
similar
its
just
much
more
mild
for
that
reason
i
love
this
one
zombies
lil
bro
is
fitting
enjoy
nice
citrus
nose
to
this
one
nicely
drinkable
but
a
little
thin
glad
i
finally
got
to
have
this
one
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
around
in
summer
months
nice
caramel
color
but
very
light
smell
that
doesnt
tell
you
much
mild
ale
is
very
correct
pretty
mild
flavor
that
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
sure
what
the
fuss
is
about
good
beer
for
a
mild
ale
a
little
heavy
on
the
fizziness
which
stuck
around
on
the
mouth
for
a
bit
well
carbonated
with
a
much
more
hearty
feel
and
flavour
than
some
sessions
a
good
mix
of
juicy
fruit
and
citrus
zest
hops
with
a
moderate
yeast
and
malt
base
but
it
mostly
comes
in
as
a
bright
hoppy
session
ale
begging
to
be
paired
its
food
o
not
sure
what
to
expect
as
i
cracked
the
top
on
this
one
but
hey
its
3floyds
so
i
neednt
worry
definitely
a
session
beer
light
summery
and
citrusy
smooth
o
very
solid
traditional
pale
ale
hoppy
but
smooth
this
is
not
a
hop
bomb
overall
really
nice
bitter
mild
tastes
like
some
earthy
american
type
hop
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
copper
to
light
brown
in
color
i
see
a
half
inch
of
tightly
knit
off
white
head
theres
some
haziness
within
the
beer
and
plenty
of
lacing
on
my
glass
bready
malt
aroma
with
a
gentle
touch
of
fairly
neutral
aroma
hops
i
definitely
taste
light
bready
grains
in
the
front
of
the
palate
and
i
get
a
floral
hop
finish
with
a
bready
grain
aftertaste
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
yet
moderately
carbonated
pours
a
murky
dark
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
dank
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
slight
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
can
be
boring
at
times
but
it
is
what
it
is
its
a
mild
ale
so
its
not
going
to
be
an
overwhelming
experience
the
craftsmanship
is
impressive
and
its
perfect
for
the
warm
weather
it
makes
a
nice
session
ale
overall
definitely
a
session
beer
very
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
six
pack
of
these
while
at
a
backyard
party
or
something
makes
me
hungry
for
some
barbecue
date
41614
overall
another
great
beer
by
fff
and
one
that
i
think
is
sometimes
overlooked
this
one
is
comparable
in
quality
and
taste
to
snpa
though
this
one
has
a
slightly
thinner
body
in
my
opinion
and
is
just
slightly
darker
would
recommend
especially
for
those
beginning
to
explore
the
hoppier
sides
of
craft
beer
overall
glad
i
chose
this
over
robert
and
alpha
will
pick
up
more
when
available
more
hoppy
than
expected
in
flavoring
though
a
metallic
note
surfaces
late
bitterness
is
a
bit
high
for
my
liking
very
sessionable
beer
but
the
hop
flavoring
isnt
my
favorite
lime
overpowers
pride
and
joy
is
described
as
a
mild
ale
and
it
seems
quite
telling
as
its
good
in
all
areas
but
is
as
described
mild
from
the
lightly
colored
body
to
the
mild
hop
aroma
to
the
balance
of
malt
and
floral
hops
this
is
mild
in
all
counts
probably
could
call
it
a
sessionable
pale
ale
but
all
in
all
its
tasty
and
easy
taste
is
very
nice
very
wellrounded
how
do
they
make
such
great
brew
why
doesnt
everybody
follow
this
format
is
it
just
a
race
to
find
the
next
novelty
this
isnt
as
stand
out
as
the
zombie
dust
but
its
good
dang
good
creamy
white
head
nice
soap
on
the
sides
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
perfect
i
just
tried
three
floyds
this
week
everything
has
been
great
the
beer
scene
is
maturing
o
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
another
great
brew
from
3
floyds
o
not
the
largest
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
piques
my
interest
with
its
larger
emphasis
on
the
malts
though
the
hops
have
certainly
not
been
forgotten
o
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
a
really
nice
wellbalanced
session
candidate
goes
down
supersmooth
and
easy
very
easy
to
like
that
said
its
nothing
special
just
very
good
at
being
what
it
is
which
is
just
an
easydrinking
thirst
quencher
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
though
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
this
may
be
my
favorite
fff
ale
and
i
have
had
most
of
them
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
it
is
a
sessionable
version
of
an
apa
solid
esb
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
examples
of
esbs
out
there
but
this
is
otherwise
a
nice
sessionable
and
drinkable
take
on
the
style
from
three
floyds
overall
3floyds
accomplished
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
with
this
one
recommended
o
immensely
drinkable
but
mild
i
suppose
is
a
relative
thing
it
makes
for
the
most
subtle
beer
ive
had
from
three
floyds
but
its
hops
and
citrus
make
it
a
far
bolder
statement
than
some
strong
ales
ive
had
o
a
good
beer
i
liked
it
and
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
a
very
nice
sessionable
pale
ale
some
what
muted
hop
flavor
but
enough
to
get
your
attention
and
accentuate
the
experience
nice
citrus
flavors
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
not
overwhelming
in
any
of
the
flavor
characteristics
perfect
segway
into
the
bigger
pales
and
ipas
overall
a
great
session
beer
very
attractive
appearance
and
an
excellent
full
aroma
refreshing
and
crisp
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
do
bring
out
a
bit
of
thinness
to
it
though
pours
amber
with
a
1finger
off
white
head
some
real
good
citrus
notes
on
the
nose
orange
and
lemon
are
the
main
culprits
with
a
thin
sugary
malt
backbone
pretty
good
for
such
a
small
brew
the
taste
is
very
good
as
well
lots
of
citrus
and
tropical
notes
its
also
very
balanced
the
malt
picks
up
right
after
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
light
this
could
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
as
far
as
session
beers
goes
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
except
for
the
price
of
course
and
the
fact
that
i
have
to
drive
40
mins
away
to
maybe
find
it
other
than
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
had
notes
thanks
tom
for
this
one
its
a
very
good
apa
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
a
solid
beer
but
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
three
floyds
its
appearance
is
probably
its
biggest
drawback
just
a
murky
unappealing
color
i
have
trouble
detecting
a
distinct
smell
but
the
feel
and
taste
are
satisfying
tastes
a
lot
better
than
it
looks
a
tame
but
nicely
balanced
beer
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
have
loved
20
years
ago
when
i
was
transitioning
from
rolling
rock
to
craft
beer
its
also
the
kind
of
beer
id
serve
my
friends
who
think
heineken
is
classy
but
are
afraid
of
craft
beer
i
had
one
for
the
pride
and
one
for
the
joy
during
dinner
i
had
another
for
the
just
in
case
it
felt
left
out

i
really
like
pride
joy
granted
i
havent
had
many
mild
ales
so
i
may
have
graded
this
a
bit
high
perfect
beer
to
sip
on
this
hot
summer
day
azurescensjun
25
but
sad
the
high
point
is
the
nose
as
id
rather
drink
a
pale
than
sit
and
smell
it
and
id
want
to
drink
lots
of
them
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
here
and
there
with
a
nice
deep
copper
penny
color
the
nose
does
subtle
attacks
of
citrus
and
brings
thoughts
of
how
good
the
taste
will
be
the
taste

it
seems
to
be
lacking
a

profile
that
i
recall
all
i
get
on
the
flavor

a
bit
of

and
then
it
just
kind
of
leaves
a
bitter
taste
on

the
feel
is
nice

i

its
easy

let

it

a

a
sessionable
ale
brewed
with
american
hops
the
beer
is
a
solid
amber
with
little
head
and
aroma
there
is
just
a
twinge
of
tangerine
aroma
rather
mild
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
is
rather
strong
the
aftertaste
also
leads
to
a
dry
mouthfeel
with
no
really
detectable
carbonation
and
a
relatively
smooth
feel
overall
enough
malt
to
keep
the
nubes
from
spitting
it
out
d
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
and
the
first
one
did
the
same
thing
with
fizzing
over
out
of
the
bottle
if
you
can
get
throught
all
the
fizziness
its
a
good
solid
beer
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
for
a
while
the
carbonation
really
ruins
this
beer
for
me
i
have
to
wait
for
it
to
setlle
down
to
really
get
the
taste
of
it
when
i
open
a
beer
i
want
to
drink
it
right
now
and
not
wait
20
min
d
drinkability
really
after
tasting
this
beer
you
will
want
more
it
is
deffinetly
worth
the
long
drive
to
get
it
for
me
d
the
lower
abv
on
this
beer
makes
it
closer
to
a
session
beer
this
is
a
gem
in
the
3
floyds
portfolio
that
doesnt
get
too
much
recognition
a
perfect
jump
into
the
world
of
3
floyds
were
not
normal
mentality
d
pretty
good
prettay
prettay
there
is
little
aroma
and
mild
flavor
which
is
not
a
fault
per
se
for
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
too
however
i
am
sure
that
theres
a
way
to
do
whatever
this
beer
does
and
yet
not
cross
the
4
abv
mark
great
session
beer
i
would
be
lucky
to
have
access
to
this
everyday
it
has
a
pretty
good
drinkability
with
light
crisp
ale
flavors
light
malty
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
the
only
thing
taking
away
is
the
lingering
hop
resins
with
fresh
hop
flavors
which
taste
great
but
take
a
bit
away
from
drinkability
d
not
half
the
beer
that
alpha
king
and
gumballhead
are
its
always
puzzled
me
why
fff
picked
this
one
as
part
of
their
standard
lineup
why
not
black
sun
thats
different
still
2nd
class
fff
is
better
than
a
game
efforts
from
most
breweries
very
high
if
im
bringing
a
6pack
to
a
party
this
might
be
it
great
taste
aroma
mouthfeel
a
perfect
drink
for
any
occasion
d
i
dont
know
how
i
feel
about
this
maybe
i
was
too
hard
on
pj
it
is
almost
like
alpha
king
is
pride
joys
smoking
hot
older
sister
although
pride
joy
is
still
attractive
tasty
it
isnt
up
to
par
with
alpha
king
making
a
good
beer
seem
inferior
when
in
fact
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
as
mentioned
above
on
a
hot
humid
summer
afternoon
in
downtown
chicago
i
really
couldnt
ask
for
anything
more
especially
right
before
heading
back
into
the
office
for
a
few
last
hours
of
work
for
the
week
it
is
a
lighter
feeling
beer
but
does
not
lack
in
the
flavor
department
at
all
three
floyds
as
usual
does
it
again
the
bottle
calls
this
beer
a
mild
ale
and
ba
labels
it
as
an
apa
i
am
more
inclined
to
classify
it
as
the
latter
this
is
a
well
crafted
easy
to
drink
beer
that
fits
right
in
with
the
three
floyds
style
very
good
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
not
readily
available
in
my
area
thanks
nate
d
great
session
beer
a
good
one
for
those
prefer
to
not
go
hop
heavy
all
night
classic
mild
taste
for
a
smooth
finish
and
an
all
around
good
experience
d
crisp
and
refreshing
i
plan
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
for
my
next
party
if
i
can
find
it
no
ohio
distribution
so
hopefully
i
can
find
it
in
ky
or
in
d
a
nice
ale
some
nice
citrus
in
the
smell
and
a
decent
taste
would
try
again
cheers
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
ever
tried
by
fff
poured
from
bottle
into
a
12
oz
stein
pours
a
hazy
caramel
colour
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lasted
forever
has
a
nice
hoppy
yeasty
smell
with
big
hints
of
citrus
has
a
nice
bitter
taste
backed
by
a
strong
yeasty
bread
finish
drinks
great
flavorful
all
the
way
through
especially
towards
the
end
as
it
warmed
a
great
introduction
to
fff
d
good
solid
beer
anytime
i
get
a
pick
six
would
always
put
one
of
these
in
for
the
price
anytime
you
come
over
ill
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
d
this
is
a
delicious
apa
very
light
yet
flavorful
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
the
mouth
and
it
could
have
had
a
better
head
but
this
doesnt
take
away
from
its
drinkability
too
much
if
this
beer
was
local
id
buy
it
often
d
for
an
apa
this
is
stands
out
as
full
of
flavor
without
destroying
your
taste
buds
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
i
would
have
said
sessionable
without
advance
knowledge
of
the
abv
d
really
nice
sessionable
almost
session
strength
beer
milds
arent
my
thing
but
this
is
good
id
have
one
again
if
no
more
flavorful
beers
were
available
this
would
be
my
2nd
beer
from
three
floyds
im
trying
got
some
good
ones
as
extras
in
a
trade
pours
a
nice
golenamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
very
appealing
with
its
lovely
hop
scent
not
as
appealing
as
alpha
king
was
though
but
unique
in
its
own
way
not
as
malty
as
alpha
king
but
more
of
a
west
coast
style
apa
a
bit
of
a
piney
scent
as
well
the
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
possibly
some
unamerican
hops
used
in
this
one
i
get
a
taste
in
this
beer
that
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
so
i
could
figure
out
what
it
is
it
is
pretty
delicious
though
not
as
hoppy
as
its
scent
but
definitely
got
somethin
special
goin
on
here
possibly
some
sort
of
herbs
and
spices
its
gonna
bug
me
for
the
rest
of
the
night
now
wondering
what
that
flavor
is
that
im
getting
mouthfeel
is
okayt
and
drinkability
is
very
high
im
very
happy
with
this
beer
but
frustrated
at
the
same
time
d
very
easy
to
drink
while
still
staying
fullflavored
and
bitter
at
6
5
an
easy
and
great
ale
flavor
is
a
lot
better
while
is
starts
watery
it
follows
with
a
wave
of
hops
and
citrus
fruit
the
hops
are
very
nice
only
slightly
malty
and
a
light
crisp
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
high
for
the
style
its
a
nice
drinker
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
i
could
drink
this
all
damn
day
its
got
a
nice
balance
to
it
its
also
flavorful
but
refreshing
and
there
is
no
noticable
alcohol
character
contributing
here
despite
it
being
6
5
mild
or
not
its
a
damn
fine
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
all
around
for
this
category
to
what
i
have
had
to
date
near
perfect
balance
makes
me
wish
i
could
get
fff
in
ohio
and
also
makes
me
want
to
take
a
drive
to
indiana
right
now
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
apa
with
no
overwhelming
bitterness
but
great
flavor
very
nicely
balanced
and
very
summerlike
mild
ale
d
perfect
a
perfect

this
is
another
fff
brew
that
would
be
a
staple
for
me
all
summer
long
i
couldnt
agree
more
having
sampled
6
other
3fs
offerings
id
like
to
add
that
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
session
beer
that
can
accompany
most
foods
ill
definitely
pick
up
a
case
the
next
time
i

definitly
a

reminds

with

overall
a
very

beer
well
balanced
in
almost
every
way
d
good
drinkability
and
one
that
is
light
and
mild
enough
to
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
without
being
overwhelmed
a
clean
finish
highlights
this
drink
drinkability
is
good
tasty
little
beer
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
certainly
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
just
wish
this
had
a
better
mouthfeel
three
floyds
classifies
this
beer
as
a
mild
ale
yet
it
is
listed
on
beeradvocate
as
a
pale
ale
interesting
as
a
mild
ale
it
is
quite
a
hoppy
and
flavorful
rendition
but
as
a
pale
ale
it
is
a
bit
thin
on
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
if
given
a
choice
i
would
unquestionable
reach
for
the
other
three
floyds
pale
ale
this
is
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
to
date
simply
amazing
for
its
style
maybe
more
of
an
american
version
of
an
english
mild
the
abv
is
a
little
high
as
well
but
definitely
sessionable
recommended
drinkability
like
a
baby
alpha
king
this
one
a
solid
and
drinkable
if
not
mindblowing
beer
with
a
very
reasonable
abv
i
can
see
putting
away
a
sixer
of
this
one
on
the
patio
on
a
warm
spring
day
fairly
easily
if
a
i
had
a
patio
or
b
i
lived
anywhere
where
3fs
was
distributed
as
neither
of
those
are
true
im
going
to
just
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
with
a
nice
array
of
balanced
flavors
nothing
over
the
top
about
this
beer
from
a
brewery
known
for
going
over
the
top
recommended
good
hopped
taste
blending
well
with
the
malt
with
the
hops
somewhat
in
control
of
the
flavor
with
a
rather
sour
finishwell
done
good
mouthfeel
creamy
with
a
slightly
bitter
bite
from
the
hops
yet
this
is
really
more
smooth
this
is
just
as
advertiseda
session
brew
one
easy
to
down
and
i
had
three
after
dinner
while
playing
board
games
with
the
family
just
an
excellent
apa
session
the
living
hell
out
of
this
dan
interesting
pale
ale
to
say
the
least
i
really
have
not
come
across
a
hop
character
so
lemony
it
manages
to
push
across
some
big
flavours
without
relying
on
alcohol
strength
overal
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinker
a
solid
nottoocomplex
beer
d
what
happened
to
my
glass
it
was
full
a
minute
ago
too
bad
this
is
as
big
as
a
bud
heavy
is
bud
a
session
beer
i
forget
does
a
session
beer
equate
to
a
pounding
chugfest
beer
i
mean
i
suppose
any
beer
could
be
chugged
if
you
had
the
will
power
but
i
digress
d
a
curious
beer
for
sure
not
a
mild
ale
but
not
quite
an
apa
either
kinda
ipaish
but
not
quite
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
fruity
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
taste
profile
but
having
said
that
i
found
myself
downing
3
of
these
suckers
tonight
and
enjoyed
them
can
i
hear
someone
say
session
beer
you
cant
deny
that
3f
brew
a
fine
beer
drinkability
mouthfeel
very
good
beer
overall
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
the
carbonation
is
very
light
d
the
sweetness
is
why
i
gave
it
an
avg
drinkability
this
one
needs
to
be
nurtured
and
for
me
was
just
a
little
on
the
harder
side
to
drink
because
of
the
sweetness
gave
it
avg
because
i
figured
it
could
just
be
me
dan
english
mild
turned
on
its

bring

dfor
a

of

yes
but
with
the
wacky
uncompromising

of

floyds

i
could
see
this
giving
me
a
surprise
hangover

other
of

drinkability
so
great
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
session
beer
for
people
who
like
good
beer
i
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
but
please
start
distributing
again
in
ohio
md
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
and
clean
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
but
overall
a
very
good
feel
pours
a
amberish
orange
in
color
decent
head
forms
on
the
pour
smell
is
light
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
the
fff
hopping
not
a
whole
lot
of
the
hops
coming
through
in
the
taste
the
malts
and
a
bit
of
carameltoffee
as
well
decent
mild
and
easy
drinking
d
its
a
decent
beer
for
everyday
use
but
i
prefer
alpha
king
over
this
one
d
solid
session
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
the
mild
kick
leaves
you
safe
having
several
unfortunately
i
cant
get
several
out
here
but
if
i
could
i
surely
would
another
fff
winner
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
a
good
balance
with
some
sweetness
good
carbonation
overall
i
think
that
this
is
under
rated
for
an
apa
a
great
beer
and
easy
to
drink
yummy
poured
to
a
two
fingered
offwhite
head
head
settled
to
about
18
inch
and
hung
around
the
rest
of
the
glass
had
some
good
lacing
that
lefts
its
mark
with
every
swallow
ale
was
brownish
yellow
in
color
smelled
of
pine
citrus
and
malt
tasted
of
hopped
pine
and
citrus
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
may
of
had
too
much
carbonation
when
opened
foam
from
the
ale
came
out
of
the
bottle
i
dont
see
that
happening
very
often
all
and
all
a
very
good
ale
glass
was
trashed
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
these
thats
what
i
want
to
see
at
the
end
of
the
glass
there
was
still
some
nice
foam
at
the
bottom
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
citrus
grapefruity
hops
in
the
taste
citrus
grapefruity
hops
and
a
small
sweet
malt
a
small
hop
but
mainly
smooth
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
grapefruity
hop
in
the
aftertaste
big
hops
for
a
session
nice
and
easy
its
the
little
brother
of
alpha
king
and
just
as
sessionable
very
solid
beer
to
begin
converting
someone
into
a
hophead
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
smells
great
and
tastes
great
i
could
very
easily
drink
lots
of
these
an
beer
that
is
easy
to
drip
down
the
hatch
the
color
is
a
light
tanorange
and
looks
slightly
clear
the
aroma
has
little
distinct
notes
and
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
this
beers
flavor
is
very
subtle
and
balanced
the
light
texture
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
does
not
have
a
major
impact
with
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
more
than
one
of
d
meh
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
it
wasnt
that
i
disliked
it
i
just
had
higher
hopes
from
a
three
floyds
beer
ill
try
it
again
it
i
can
find
it
on
tap
but
not
until
then
and
then
for
just
a
sec
as
i
was
listening
to
some
bluegrass
the
folks
were
playing
there
if
this
is
somewhere
between
the
session
mild
and
the
hoppy
crazy
apa
how
awesome
is
that
how
easy
to
drink
yet
supremely
enjoyable
i
approve
pours
a
bright
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
very
small
bubbly
head
that
subsides
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
nice
balace
of
hops
citrus
and
floral
and
a
bready
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
initially
a
blast
of
light
citrus
mainly
lemon
zest
and
oranges
this
gives
way
to
some
caramel
and
sweet
bready
malts
before
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
super
refreshing
with
a
very
crisp
clean
finish
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
pale
ale
and
would
make
a
good
summer
staple
more
sips
in
and
im
finding
this
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
not
too
thin
and
the
carbonation
i
think
is
on
the
light
side
nice
pineycitric
finish
that
leaves
a
pleasing
aftertaste
quite
good
stuff
and
like
i
said
easy
drinking
and
the
head
retention
and
lacing
were
more
than
adequate
very
nice
brew
overall
and
1
that
ill
enjoy
again
because
i
have
2
more
bottles
thanks
to
jeff
received
as
a
very
generous
extra
from
bgramer
thanks
brendan
poured
a
translucent
copperamber
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
good
head
retention
that
eventually
settled
into
a
quarterinch
consistent
cap
bands
of
sticky
concentric
half
moon
rings
of
lacing
present
during
the
session
scent
of
hops
and
a
mild
citrus
essence
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
light
biscuity
quality
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
slight
burn
across
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
some
hops
bitterness
at
the
back
nice
brew
actually
reminded
me
of
a
more
subdued
version
of
roxy
rolles
this
beer
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
the
majority
of
the
smell
seems
to
be
citrus
the
taste
is
nice
with
a
mixture
of
citrus
and
malts
the
ale
seems
a
little
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
not
the
most
pleasant
mouthfeel
minus
the
carbonation
and
this
would
be
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
overall
though
a
very
nice
mixture
of
flavors
and
something
i
will
certainly
drink
again
recommended
d
very
drinkable
and
tasty
enough
to
keep
you
interested
hopefully
fff
comes
back
to
ohio
so
i
can
take
this
tailgating
and
whatnot
okay
but
a
bit
strange
its
not
a
strong
flavored
beer
and
while
its
not
simple
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
now
if
this
was
six
or
seven
bucks
a
six
pack
id
get
it
all
the
time
but
i
have
a
hunch
it
isnt
its
drinkability
is
its
best
characteristic
a
drinkability
a
well
crafted
masterpiece
of
a
mild
ale
it
has
wonderful
balance
and
such
an
array
of
flavors
for
a
beer
of
this
type
i
cant
say
enough
about
3fffs
their
beers
are
always
of
the
highest
caliber
and
are
friggin
delicious
i
could
drink
this
beer
any
time
of
day
and
any
time
of
year
best
session
beer
ever
seriously
d
this
would
make
a
great
hot
weather
beach
beer
or
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
for
someone
who
is
still
afraid
of
killer
hop
bitterness
a
good
beer
to
use
if
you
want
to
wean
someone
off
of
miller
beers
update
been
drinking
this
fairly
regularly
i
now
call
it
dreadnaught
lite
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
bone
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
into
a
thin
white
ring
smelled
great
lots
of
hops
and
citrus
notes
that
give
way
to
a
freshly
baked
bread
aroma
taste
like
an
ipa
but
with
a
little
more
malt
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
hops
note
that
disappears
as
quick
as
the
swallow
good
clean
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
could
drink
several
over
a
night
at
the
lake
or
sitting
on
the
back
porch
on
a
warm
alabama
night
d
excellent
drinkability
its
been
years
since
ive
had
this
and
id
forgotten
how
tasty
and
sessionable
this
beer
is
perfect
for
the
summer
drinkability
i
could
definitely
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
this
would
be
one
of
my
goto
beers
notes
thanks
to
dyan
for
this
one
i
could
get
used
to
drinking
this
fff
stuff
d
this
is
now
my
favorite
mild
ale
it
is
so
damn
drinkable
that
i
have
vowed
to
stop
drinking
water
from
now
on
i
am
not
going
to
file
a
beerspy
report
just
stay
the
hell
away
from
this
beer
d
oh
boy
im
glad
i
have
another
3
of
these
puppies
d
a
really
nice
beer
makes
me
want
to
make
a
mild
so
that
i
can
enjoy
something
like
this
more
often
prolly
be
a
good
dry
hop
fix
in
these
rough
times
if
all
you
want
is
a
nice
dry
hop
scent
and
juiciness
nearly
gushes
from
the
bottle
pouring
a
clear
medium
ambercaramel
color
and
massive
offwhite
head
aromas
are
characteristic
fff
lots
of
citrusy
resiny
hops
a
bit
of
toasty
malts
are
noted
not
quite
biscuity
but
with
a
caramel
like
toasted
character
on
the
palate
the
hops
have
nearly
dissapeared
and
the
malts
while
not
overly
characterful
like
they
should
be
in
a
mild
take
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
interestingly
this
beer
is
way
over
carbonated
to
giving
you
quite
a
bite
and
drying
the
finish
out
too
much
i
dont
think
its
infected
but
theres
something
seriously
wrong
with
the
carbonation
level
given
that
it
really
hurts
the
drinkability

very

flavorful
sessionable
ale
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
but
this
one
grew
on
me
big
time
we
had
this
from
the
cask
at
cellar
temperature
at
the
map
room
not
even
at
the
fff
have
we
had
this
version
it
is
a
pale
chestnut
color
with
very
little
head
not
surprising
really
aroma
was
very
muted
to
my
mind
the
beer
was
veering
towards
oxidation
there
was
a
hint
of
flatness
about
the
taste
surrounded
by
a
endless
highalcohol
beers
it
can
be
something
of
a
relief
to
drink
a
lighter
style
this
is
redolent
of
a
ligher
english
bitter
muted
hop
bitterness
and
quite
dry
it
is
very
accessible
and
drinkable
even
if
it
doesnt
leave
a
pronounced
mark
d
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
would
be
nice
on
a
summer
day
very
sessionable
alpha
kings
little
brother
hard
not
to
drink
alot
of
these
hazy
light
amber
color
with
goldencopper
hues
fluffy
white
head
becomes
offwhite
as
it
dissipates
how
strange
aromas
of
leafy
hops
wood
oil
sap
fresh
dough
and
biscuit
dough
the
flavors
reprise
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
marmalade
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
just
a
tad
lighter
than
medium
body
finish
of
yeast
dough
and
citrus
peel
its
funny
how
an
american
interpretation
of
a
british
mild
comes
out
as
a
standard
profile
for
an
american
pale
ale
a
damn
good
one
though
allinall
a
tasty
easy
to
drink
sessionable
beer
that
id
love
to
have
again
another
mild
beer
based
on
the
english
style
a
nice
refreshing
change
to
the
bigger
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
cloudy
orange
honey
colored
with
a
soapy
sudsy
head
smell
is
uniquesly
fruity
tangerine
strikes
me
most
very
fresh
smelling
but
slighty
subdued
strengthed
nose
overall
taste
has
hints
of
orange
with
mild
bittersweet
hops
quite
carbonated
but
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
to
go
along
and
resultedy
tastes
a
bit
weak
and
slightly
bland
what
flavor
there
is
is
nice
and
is
unique
as
far
as
ambers
go
good
effort
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
bottle
of
this
that
i
knew
for
a
fact
was
fresh
i
wouldnt
change
anything
about
this
beer
except
that
i
would
increase
its
availability
in
the
washington
d
c
area
thanks
to
sephiroth
for
the
fff
beers
anyhoo
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
with
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
sweet
citrustropical
fruit
aromas
are
abundant
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
is
followed
by
a
sweet
light
citrus
type
hop
flavor
that
gets
balanced
out
by
a
malty
finishing
kick
the
flavor
is
pretty
crisp
and
clean
though
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
want
more
nice
the
first
6pk
i
tried
was
very
foamy
excessively
so
i
assumed
this
was
not
typical
so
sometime
later
i
bought
a
second
6
but
with
the
same
results
explosively
foamy
i
like
plenty
of
head
so
this
is
an
odd
complaint
for
me
retention
was
poor
smell
and
taste
average
at
best
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
this
and
watery
in
my
opinion
american
pale
ale
ipa
and
imperial
stouts
are
my
favourite
styles
there
are
much
better
apas
to
choose
from
if
it
were
not
for
that
funky
smell
this
beer
would
have
gotten
a
fantastic
review
but
i
just
could
not
get
past
it
thanks
joe1510
for
the
chance
to
revisit
this
in
the
bottle
d
i
wish
that
this
was
available
here
seems
like
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
having
to
trade
for
it
basically
makes
that
impossible
though
let
me
know
if
you
have
a
case
you
want
to
get
rid
of
drinkability
is
high
and
in
the
session
range
at
5abv
this
is
a
classic
apa
more
so
that
the
more
hopforward
alpha
king
apa
with
great
malt
presence
and
no
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
body
another
great
beer
from
fff
not
three
floyds
best
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
would
drink
again
but
a
six
pack
probably
would
only
cost
three
dollars
more
than
one
bottle
does
here
in
california
recommended
for
fans
of
easy
to
drink
pale
ales
slightly
hazy
light
amberorange
white
head
with
okay
retention
and
lace
nose
was
light
hops
and
malt
orangy
w
faint
sweet
bread
taste
was
a
well
balanced
malthop
mesh
with
a
medium
body
and
a
slight
slight
bitter
finish
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
all
night
it
goes
really
well
with
tons
of
foods
a
really
exceptional
session
beer
ive
got
to
give
it
to
these
guys
and
im
sure
they
hear
it
all
the
time
but
they
make
fantastic
beers
i
hope
they
never
get
too
big
for
their
britches
like
a
lot
of
other
brewers
but
i
hope
they
start
sending
their
stuff
to
the
east
coast
as
well
gogo
3fs
pride
joy
is
another
good
beer
from
three
floyds
although
alpha
king
is
what
i
usually
pick
up
in
6pack
form
pride
joy
is
more
on
the
sessionable
side
and
enjoyable
as
well
three
floyds
does
some
good
things
when
it
comes
to
hops
just
noticed
that
this
beer
has
an
ibu
rating
of
29
i
find
this
fascinating
because
i
perceive
it
as
being
more
bitter
than
dipas
with
five
times
the
ibu
rating
this
beer
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
forever
nice

finger

tastes
excellent
balance
of

nice
and
bitter
but
citrusy
as
well
as
malty
have
also
had
it
on
draft
at
the
brew
pub
great
beer
all
around
pours
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
fantastic
head
and
lacing
it
has
an
excellent
hoppy
and
slightly
floral
scent
absolutely
wonderful
taste
a
great
pale
ale
that
has
an
excellent
hoppy
taste
with
some
nice
butterscotch
tones
which
is
followed
by
a
very
mellow
bitter
aftertaste
goes
down
fine
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
my
tastes
all
in
all
though
another
excellent
winner
from
3f
pours
goldenorange
amber
nose
is
strong
pine
hops
flavor
is
just
the
same
bitter
salty
hops
that
stay
consistent
but
arent
so
salty
that
it
just
messes
the
whole
experience
up
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
nice
liquid
feel
overall
a
good
drink
the
salt
could
stand
to
be
a
wee
bit
lower
i
think
but
still
a
good
brew
mellow
and
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
very
well
balanced
and
slickjuicy
in
texture
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
and
underrated
apas
out
there
in
my
opinion
also
one
of
the
best
session
beers
i
can
think
of
due
to
its
lower
abv
and
flavorful
well
balanced
nature
drinkability
though
light
in
alcohol
its
anything
but
mild
nicely
flavorful
with
a
high
drinkability
d
good
beer
drinkability
good
smooth
beer
with
a
low
abv
this
is
not
a
big
beer
and
is
a
welcome
change
from
some
of
the
overpowering
beers
that
are
out
there
you
would
be
able
to
have
several
of
these
in
an
evening
if
you
desired
and
not
feel
the
affects
good
session
beer
dthough
all
the
excitement
of
this
one
is
in
the
nose
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
ale
it
is
quite
mild
which
makes
it
much
easier
to
drink
or
even
session
ill
pick
up
this
one
againif
i
ever
find
fff
again
pours
golden
with
a
large
creme
head
on
top
almost
the
same
color
as
gumballhead
but
maybe
a
slight
bit
more
orange
could
use
some
more
carbonation
taste
has
some
good
citrus
stuff
happening
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
after
a
few
minutes
the
head
dissipates
goes
pretty
well
with
a
mesquite
turkey
bacon
cheddar
gouda
and
dill
pickle
sandwich
and
some
creedence
a
decent
beer
but
one
of
the
weaker
three
floyds
beers
the
gumballhead
is
better
in
every
way
except
for
the
head
d
rather
dry
but
this
beer
is
really
refreshing
and
the
spicy
bitterness
is
awesome
pours
a
foggy
rich
amber
hue
with
a
chunky
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
dies
down
to
almost
nothing
but
it
doesnt
disappear
without
leaving
its
mark
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
interesting
kind
of
musty
earth
hop
aroma
with
a
strange
malt
scent
blended
in
light
citrus
is
hidden
in
the
nose
as
well
good
caramel
malt
presence
up
front
on
the
tongue
a
mild
citrus
sweetness
arises
midway
and
contributes
to
the
lemongrass
aftertaste
close
to
a
medium
body
with
an
aggressive
carbonation
nothing
special
but
a
good
one
to
experience
hazy
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
nose
was
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
also
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
sugary
malts
some
earthy
tones
keep
it
fairly
mild
crisp
and
refreshing
medium
body
good
example
of
an
american
mild
ale
hoppy
but
in
good
balance
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
very
well
balanced
with
almost
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
in
the
flavour
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
great
depth
to
the
hops
too
keeping
things
interesting
this
one
seems
like
itd
be
fantastic
on
cask
definitely
recommended
wow
very
solid
offering
and
my
first
of
hopefully
many
3fs
offerings
the
color
is
a
dull
gold
with
a
bit
of
copper
mixed
in
cloudy
from
the
yeast
sediment
which
i
dont
mind
at
allbring
on
the
bcomplex
vitamins
the
smell
is
mostly
fruity
hops
with
some
caramel
malt
and
maybe
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
taste
is
hops
with
the
malt
there
in
the
back
doesnt
doesnt
really
break
through
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
low
with
some
lively
carbonation
my
only
complaint
is
that
there
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
but
not
much
drinkability
is
pretty
awesome
i
love
this
as
a
session
beer
a
great
apa
not
even
close
to
a
mild
though
but
who
cares
i
guess
it
just
counts
as
a
mild
next
to
their
other
rididiculous
brews
man
thats
a
good
beer
sessionable
flavorful
characterful
but
arent
milds
as
the
bottle
suggests
supposed
to
be
a
light
brown
ale
this
beer
is
far
from
being
a
mild
but
would
make
a
great
extra
pale
ale
somewhere
between
a
copper
and
golden
color
with
a
thin
starkwhite
head
formation
and
retention
the
flavors
are
dominated
by
an
english
hop
aroma
earthy
grassy
and
with
a
medium
malt
character
that
struggles
to
counter
the
hops
the
malt
flavors
take
on
viennatype
flavors
and
come
across
pleasant
and
light
body
is
quite
light
slight
of
thin
but
make
the
beer
very
easy
to
drink
finishes
with
a
light
caramel
taste
and
strong
hop
bittering
good
stuff
again
by
three
floyds
man
we
need
some
three
floyds
distribution
in
mn
please
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
yet
another
very
good
beer
from
3f
i
could
certainly
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
an
evening
the
biggest
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
selecting
this
beer
if
it
ever
comes
back
to
my
area
is
that
i
would
prefer
alpha
king
above
it
and
any
place
around
here
that
would
have
pride
joy
would
most
likely
have
alpha
king
as
well
pour
is
a
foggy
orange
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
finger
of
head
that
takes
its
time
disappearing
nose
is
like
some
crazy
fruity
candy
extravaganza
a
mix
of
fruity
hops
and
sweet
caramel
delicious
aromas
taste
is
fairly
similar
fruity
hops
segue
nicely
into
delicious
candy
malt
lighter
hops
show
up
at
the
back
end
that
hoppy
bitterness
increases
a
touch
as
the
beer
goes
on
medium
almost
creamy
body
to
this
one
with
excellent
carbonation
i
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
my
first
three
floyds
and
one
id
have
again
except
for
if
the
alpha
king
was
available
flavor
mainly
with
citrusy
hops
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
well
balanced
not
at
all
overly
hopped
its
slightly
dry
but
no
in
a
bad
way
this
is
a
great
session
brew
and
if
its
ever
available
in
missouri
i
will
make
sure
to
keep
my
fridge
stock
with
a
few
sixers
of
pride
joy
high
on
the
drinkability
curve
pours
a
golden
hue
with
an
aggressively
rapid
forming
rapid
descending
two
fingers
of
foam
aromas
of
grassy
pine
grapefruit
lemon
hops
as
well
as
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
some
biscuit
malts
and
some
pine
and
citrus
flavored
hops
in
the
finish
good
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
very
good
mild
ale
that
one
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
row
large
tight
foam
with
a
fair
amount
of
staying
power
clear
nicely
carbonated
russett
appearance
i
love
the
floral
aromatics
that
beckon
me
to
take
large
pulls
bitter
and
not
as
tasty
as
it
smells
it
is
a
solid
apa
mediumbodied
this
almost
has
a
bit
too
much
of
a
soapy
finish
but
it
easy
drinking
nonetheless
this
is
a
beer
for
those
of
us
who
like
the
tongue
to
be
challenged
by
flavor
but
not
have
our
asses
kicked
with
alcohol
recommended
drinkability
great
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
i
think
it
borders
on
the
apaipa
borderline
but
i
would
take
it
over
either
almost
every
time
so
hoppy
so
balance
so
terrific
dextremely
drinkable
great
bear
and
a
fine
welcome
to
the
midwest
all
hail
the
men
and
women
of
3
floyds
this
truly
should
be
one
of
their
pride
and
joys
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
better
3
floyds
offerings
i
like
hops
and
all
but
their
brews
often
take
it
to
the
extreme
this
one
is
more
middle
of
the
road
recommended
i
was
expecting
a
boring
beer
but
this
definitely
delivered
a
nice
session
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
munster
nice
golden
color
with
a
small
but
longlasting
head
great
citrus
hop
aroma
nice
whitebread
malt
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
playing
off
each
other
nice
balance
a
crisp
medium
body
that
would
have
worked
well
into
a
long
session
if
i
didnt
have
to
get
back
on
the
road
fairly
quickly
this
is
proof
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
extreme
to
be
well
done
and
noticeably
so
this
actually
reminded
me
of
a
muted
version
of
the
fff
alpha
king
which
i
really
enjoyed
although
not
as
good
fff
did
not
disappoint
with
this
beer
overall
i
was
very
much
impressed
here
it
just
was
soo
smooth
and
light
you
could
drink
it
forever
and
not
even
know
if
i
was
around
it
more
it
would
stock
my
fridge
constantly
just
a
good
no
great
beer
i
avoided
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
because
i
assumed
it
would
be
overly
malty
like
english
milds
tend
to
be
i
should
have
known
better
this
is
an
american
interpretation
excellent
session
beer
for
the
warm
weather
with
low
alcohol
unfortunately
no
freshness
date
on
bottle
i
highly
recommend
this
one
d
an
amazingly
drinkable
ale
a
great
session
beer
it
would
be
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
and
hard
to
find
in
my
area
allaround
a
great
smaller
beer
from
3
floyds
they
continue
to
amaze
now
only
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
that
elusive
dark
lord
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
a
massive
white
foam
head
in
fact
i
think
the
head
is
still
forming
im
lucky
the
beer
did
not
foam
over
i
had
to
repour
several
times
because
of
the
continuously
mounting
head
smell
is
citrus
and
hoppy
but
not
as
much
as
alpha
king
taste
is
citrus
and
hoppy
with
a
slight
alcohol
taste
limited
carbonation
in
this
one
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
and
not
as
powerful
as
alpha
king
a
nice
beer
from
three
floyds
cant
really
say
that
ive
really
been
a
big
english
dark
mild
ale
drinker
and
thus
have
a
basis
for
comparison
but
as
i
began
i
dont
think
one
would
recognize
this
beer
as
of
style
but
i
dont
hold
their
phenomenal
gumballhead
against
them
because
they
decided
to
play
with
hops
so
i
dont
here
either
would
gladly
quaff
a
pint
from
the
tap
but
with
that
much
hop
flavor
theres
something
about
a
bracing
bitter
edge
not
necessarily
a
big
one
that
is
appealing
and
id
rather
reach
for
a
beer
that
has
one
if
im
looking
for
this
much
hop
flavor
it
smells
like
a
sticky
malt
and
nicely
balanced
soft
pine
aroma
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
and
smooth
the
flavor
and
the
smell
are
quite
similar
sweet
and
full
flavored
with
a
hint
of
lemon
that
i
missed
in
the
nose
quite
drinkable
and
at
5
abv
is
a
real
good
session
beer
really
enjoyed
this
one
got
as
an
extra
in
trade
with
czoch75
thanks
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
little
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
had
a
good
head
that
settled
into
a
wispy
film
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
citric
hops
with
malts
in
the
back
i
agree
with
others
that
it
reminds
you
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
mild
ale
the
taste
was
pretty
good
and
tastes
like
a
slightly
watered
down
pale
ale
it
doesnt
have
a
real
standout
taste
but
is
a
good
session
beer
when
you
want
a
little
more
flavor
than
a
standard
session
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carby
good
mix
overall
a
good
average
beer
that
is
worth
trying
not
avail
here
so
wont
be
a
player
in
my
rotation
but
if
avail
it
would
be
worth
a
6ixer
or
two
every
year
for
variety

5
rb
t
y
finally
the
drinkability
this
is
an
outstanding
ale
that
deserves
nothing
less
than
exceptional
status
it
is
very
pleasing
indeed
and
to
say
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
would
not
do
it
credit
pride
and
joy
lives
up
to
its
name
well
done
three
floyds
outstanding
pale
ale
if
judged
for
truth
to
style
i
would
be
forced
to
give
terrible
marks
but
judged
on
merit
and
flavor
a
terrific
and
sessionable
mild
ale
that
brings
the
hops
without
any
negative
aftertaste
my
addiction
to
hops
notwithstanding
nearly
anyone
who
has
tasted
this
one
can
agree
that
this
one
tastes
amazing
truly
the
alpha
kings
pale
ale
kin
without
the
american
pale
ale
stigma
d
i
guess
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
would
prefer
the
company
of
better
pale
ales
taste
is
very
mellow
with
some
bready
notes
holding
up
the
vanilla
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
pine
in
there
as
well
liquorice
herbal
mandarin
orange
and
a
little
lemon
sourness
to
round
it
off
more
complex
than
the
average
mild
ale
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
carbonation
isnt
overbearing
in
the
mouth
slightly
drying
finish
but
not
extremely
so
this
is
drinkable
to
a
t
my
final
verdict
on
this
is
that
its
much
like
a
watered
down
alpha
king
it
has
a
lot
of
the
same
flavours
but
theyre
much
more
muted
a
well
made
ale
but
it
dosent
take
it
to
the
next
level
thats
what
the
rest
of
the
three
floyds
lineup
is
for
on
tap
served
in
a
pint
glass
fffs
version
of
a
session
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
little
haziness
still
has
the
great
hop
aroma
you
have
come
to
expect
extremely
drinkable
aromas
of
very
light
hops
and
some
citrus
light
body
with
a
very
quick
bitter
finish
nice
lightly
smokey
hoppy
finish
a
nice
little
beer
from
three
floyds
d
3f
never
disappoints
and
this
was
a
nice
brew
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
never
would
have
guessed
english
dark
mild
ale
for
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
milds
are
typically
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
would
be
good
for
a
long
poker
night
when
you
dont
want
to
get
too
loaded
overall
an
excellent
and
supremely
drinkable
ale
from
what
i
read
not
a
traditional
mild
ale
but
who
cares
this
may
very
well
be
one
of
those
desert
island
beers
i
only
wish
i
had
access
thanks
to
czoch75
taste
is
bitter
hoppy
and
fruity
with
citric
and
resinous
earthy
notes
there
is
a
light
malt
backbone
but
that
is
pushed
away
by
the
hops
and
body
is
quite
thin
the
beer
is
very
dry
which
make
the
beer
appear
even
more
bitter
the
carbonation
is
smooth
little
gas
bubbles
feel
nice
on
the
tongue
in
the
end
i
get
some
sort
of
sweetness
although
the
beer
is
dry
it
is
evident
that
they
didnt
add
alot
of
malt
to
the
bill
from
the
sheer
carbonation
the
co2
throat
burn
cuts
the
drinkabliity
back
a
hair

i
said
they
pulled
it
off

for

this

a

beer
so
im
not
surprised
at
all
its
good
tasty
and
sessionable
i
think
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
id
definitely
drink
it
again
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
a
nice
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
foam
the
foam
was
mainly
micro
with
a
few
larger
but
a
good
head
non

less
the
smell
had
hints
of
pine
but
is
faint
at
best
the
taste
is
remarkable
sparkles
on
the
tongue
throughout
each
sip
very
similar
to
a
single
orgin
coffee
from
el
salvador
the
citrus
resembles
more
of
a
quaint
grapefruit
or
a
tangerine
than
a
lemon
but
really
sizzles
on
the
tongue
the
glass
looks
great
throughout
drinking
bubbles
from
the
bottom
and
lacing
continues
until
the
end
i
really
like
this
beer
i
have
been
liking
a
lot
of
area
beers
lately
three
floyds
and
two
brothers
are
two
of
the
best
brewers
i
have
found
in
a
while
this
would
make
an
excellent
refreshing
summer
session
beer
watery
yet
dry
with
nicely
balanced
malt
and
hop
flavour
a
tasty
and
refershing
approachable
yet
interesting
brew
wish
i
had
more
pride
joy
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
slight
tint
of
amber
to
it
it
had
half
an
inch
in
height
head
of
white
fizzy
bubbles
that
quickly
fizzled
away
into
in
to
a
few
clear
bubbles
along
the
edge
of
the
beer
and
no
lace
around
the
glass
not
even
white
bubbles
acting
as
the
lace
that
would
have
been
better
than
nothing
at
all
very
disappointing
appearance
the
smell
was
no
better
than
the
appearance
to
get
the
slightest
aroma
to
emerge
i
had
to
swirl
the
beer
around
for
a
couple
of
minutes
for
anything
to
come
out
even
then
it
wasnt
that
good
the
aroma
was
that
of
citrus
hops
a
lemon
peel
toasted
malts
and
a
pinch
of
english
toffee
in
the
back
to
get
a
whiff
of
the
toffee
you
really
need
to
stick
your
nose
into
it
and
even
then
you
might
not
catch
it
where
it
matters
most
of
all
is
where
this
beer
finally
came
out
the
taste
was
mild
and
slightly
dry
with
a
slice
of
grapefruit
toasted
malts
a
few
more
citrus
fruits
and
with
a
mild
punch
of
bitter
citrus
hops
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
yet
it
had
a
nice
aftertaste
of
dry
roasted
bitter
citrus
hops
i
noticed
that
toward
the
end
of
the
mouthfeel
it
got
somewhat
watery
not
too
watery
but
i
still
noticed
it
was
there
they
label
this
as
a
classic
session
ale
i
guess
you
could
make
this
a
reasonably
priced
three
floyds
session
ale
but
i
wouldnt
i
didnt
care
for
it
that
much
a
three
floyds
beer
that
can
be
easily
passed
up
for
some
of
their
other
offerings
this
is
called
a
mild
ale
but
is
similar
to
a
lot
of
ipas
ive
had
drink
up
update
have
had
this
many
times
since
i
wish
they
made
this
a
seasonal
less
of
it
so
they
could
make
more
of
other
stuff
like
zombie
dust
not
one
of
their
better
offerings
i
poured
this
slightly
aged
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lace
clear
amber
color
tinged
with
brown
aroma
is
a
fruity
hoppiness
with
some
hints
of
citrus
some
maltiness
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
certainly
very
drinkable
flavors
about
the
same
as
aroma
just
more
intense
relatively
short
hoppy
finish
sort
of
pale
ale
like
in
taste
and
smell
a
little
bit
maltier
and
much
more
balanced
than
an
average
pale
ale
though
this
beer
is
very
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
crazy
balance
i
cant
stop
sipping
this
beer
go
and
try
it
but
expect
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
mild
sort
of
mislabeled
d
the
beer
is
very
inviting
showing
off
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
that
never
overpowers
the
delicate
malt
body
poured
into
a
glass
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
littl
ehead
and
no
lace
smell
is
big
and
hoppy
floral
and
citrus
hops
come
to
mind
taste
is
amzing
for
the
strong
smell
of
hops
this
brew
is
kind
of
soft
and
mellow
with
big
carbonation
and
little
bitterness
awesome
offering
from
the
floyds
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
good
make
one
hell
of
a
warm
summer
brew
as
far
as
true
to
style
would
hardly
call
it
lightly
hoppy
except
for
a
fff
brew
anyway
very
enjoyable
would
probably
rate
higher
but
cant
get
over
the
style
its
stuck
in
thanks
go
to
merlin48
for
this
fine
sample
pours
a
sunny
amber
orange
with
a
pleasant
eggshell
head
with
some
lacing
after
each
sip
plus
a
few
jubilant
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
rounded
out
this
beer
nicely
the
aroma
was
of
fresh
pine
flower
stems
medium
citrus
and
some
toasty
malts
the
taste
was
a
perfect
reflection
of
the
aroma
sprucey
hops
with
some
citrus
in
the
middle
mixed
with
the
toasted
wheat
bread
in
the
middle
and
finished
with
the
floral
spicey
hops
medium
bitterness
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
great
after
owrk
beer
very
sessionable
probably
my
favorite
english
dark
mild
ale
pours
a
nice
orange
very
big
hopscitrus
aroma
taste
is
primarily
pine
resin
with
much
less
citrus
than
in
the
aroma
hops
give
nice
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
pucker
body
is
rather
thin
which
is
okay
at
this
abv
nice
lighter
alternative
to
alpha
king
very
citrusy
hoppy
and
pleasant
aroma
orange
hue
initially
stong
hop
bitterness
quickly
smoothed
out
by
a
nice
citrusy
and
malty
flavor
which
dissipates
quickly
i
could
drink
this
beer
just
for
the
aroma
alone
but
im
also
encouraged
by
its
flavor
overall
an
excellent
beer
ill
try
this
one
again
very
drinkable
a
little
heavy
to
be
a
lawnmower
ale
more
suited
for
the
fall
jeez
3fs
knows
what
there
doing
when
they
use
hops
a
solid
warm
weather
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
hops
cheers
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
colored
head
that
dissolves
quickly
and
leaves
a
slight
film
on
top
the
aroma
starts
witha
piney
earthy
scent
that
mellows
out
to
sweet
malt
fragrance
the
flavor
comes
out
with
that
malty
mellow
flavo
that
rolls
on
the
palate
then
as
it
reaches
the
end
a
slight
smack
of
bitterness
mostly
citrusy
hits
the
palate
a
thin
to
medium
feel
leaving
a
dry
finish
everything
about
this
beer
makes
want
it
to
be
good
to
great
but
it
does
not
reach
that
expectation
the
hops
seem
off
kilter
like
it
is
trying
to
be
the
antmild
mild
it
is
still
better
than
alot
of
other
beers
out
there
d
excellent
selection
and
makes
for
the
perfect
session
beer
if
i
ever
see
a
six
pack
ill
definitely
pick
one
up
d
an
intereseting
brew
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
warm
weather
brew
not
the
first
beer
i
would
reach
for
though
id
like
to
see
a
better
balance
between
malt
and
hops
the
hops
feel
a
little
overpowering
in
this
context
d
it
isnt
anything
offensive
but
its
not
trying
to
be
it
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
mild
ale
i
think
they
hit
what
they
were
going
for
poured
my
pride
joy
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
to
a
clear
brilliant
amber
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
head
was
gone
in
a
flash
but
left
some
lacing
the
smell
hit
me
the
second
i
opened
the
bottle
strong
floral
hops
something
sweet
in
there
as
well
it
had
me
taking
deep
wiffs
with
every
drink
taste
was
hops
muted
with
malt
the
word
mild
came
to
mind
and
according
to
the
name
it
should
have
it
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
not
bad
pretty
thick
and
chewy
yet
not
over
bearing
finishing
dry
and
crisp
i
plan
to
finish
my
six
pack
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
short
rocky
white
head
the
foam
settles
quickly
and
shows
just
a
little
stickage
piney
hops
hit
the
nose
first
followed
by
light
grapefruit
in
the
background
i
was
initially
surprised
but
then
i
thought
three
floyds
and
it
all
made
sense
theres
some
toasty
malt
there
too
but
its
overshadowed
by
the
hops
moderate
bitterness
with
plenty
of
hop
flavour
grassy
piney
citrusy
but
its
not
overwhelming
quite
refreshing
actually
malt
sweetness
and
caramel
flavour
is
subdued
and
theres
a
bit
of
hop
spiciness
towards
the
end
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
decent
texture
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
a
beer
id
always
keep
in
the
fridge
if
i
had
access
to
it
cheers
not
really
that
inspiring
or
in
the
spirit
of
the
project
its
fizzy
hopwater
with
some
malt
afterthoughts
d
a
perfect
hop
popsicle
for
sessioning
i
will
buy
sixers
of
this
stuff
regularly
the
mouth
is
light
and
seems
to
lack
carbonation
and
life
its
drinkable
and
mild
by
design
and
is
certainly
a
solid
session
beer
but
lacks
the
flair
expected
from
three
floyds
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
mostly
grapefruit
taste
is
citrus
up
front
with
again
grapefruit
coming
through
there
is
also
a
slight
malty
sweetness
and
toastiness
towards
the
middle
then
finishing
off
with
more
hops
pretty
light
bodied
ale
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
sure
and
would
make
a
nice
session
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
this
is
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
dont
purchase
if
you
want
a
dark
mild
drinkability
very
a
deep
gold
in
color
with
hints
of
copper
and
a
small
whitish
head
aroma
is
subtle
with
a
light
blend
of
pilsnerlike
saaz
and
more
piney
cascade
hops
but
a
very
light
touch
of
the
latter
in
the
mouth
the
hops
take
a
more
balanced
position
alongside
smoother
light
malts
which
alternately
bite
and
soothe
the
tongue
insanely
drinkable
even
more
than
my
goto
session
beer
sam
adams
boston
lager
this
is
a
keeper
for
a
lazy
spring
and
summer
days
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
definitely
gets
some
drinkability
points
the
friend
that
brought
this
back
for
me
said
that
he
tasted
a
soapy
flavor
and
now
that
i
sit
here
thinking
about
that
i
get
a
little
soapy
tast
as
well
good
beer
though
and
will
definitely
seek
out
again
recieved
this

from

5
finger

tons
of
nice
lacing
around
and
inside
the
glass
scents
of
hops
citrus
grapefruit
and
slight
malts
the
taste
is
hoppy
sweetmalty
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
medium
body
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
a
ipa
with
a
twist
way
to
go
3fs
medium
to
full
bodied
a
nice
maltiness
here
to
support
the
big
ass
hop
flavors
so
damned
drinkable
if
it
were
available
here
it
would
always
be
in
my
fridge
sure
it
isnt
a
straight
up
mild
but
its
three
floyds
so
expect
in
your
face
flavor
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
becomes
slightly
more
interesting
as
it
warms
up
buttery
smooth
mouthfeel
really
saves
this
brew
for
me
because
otherwise
this
one
is
about
average
a
toned
down
ipa
and
yeah
its
not
like
an
english
mild
three
floyds
least
crazy
beer
is
just
plain
good
very
accessible
and
drinkable
and
still
plenty
hoppy
extremely
drinkable
beer
they
live
up
to
being
their
selfproclaimed
sessionable
beer
id
get
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
good
this
would
be
an
easy
non
offensive
beer
to
drink
throughout
an
evening
very
nice
fruity
spicy
hop
aroma
taste
is
balanced
and
follows
the
smell
fruity
citric
hops
are
present
in
just
the
right
amount
mild
yet
flavorful
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
vaguely
carbonated
but
lets
the
flavors
take
center
stage
an
easy
drinker
and
what
i
would
consider
training
wheels
to
3fs
bigger
brews
well
done
i
would
say
this
is
one
pleasant
beer
i
had
a
chicken
sandwich
with
it
and
it
really
worked
well
with
it
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
one
drinkability
is
great
cuz
its
not
overly
strong
and
it
has
one
hell
of
a
hoppy
ipaish
flavor
a
bit
thin
but
i
like
it
anyways
i
really
like
this
one
and
will
be
buying
it
again
eventually
got
this
at
local
liquor
store
poured
in
to
my
tumbler
a
nice
musty
coppery
orange
the
head
is
not
very
thick
or
showy
it
dissipates
fast
and
lingers
as
a
thin
cloud
on
top
smells
of
piney
aromatic
hops
medium
sweet
and
bitter
malts
some
hints
of
honey
caramel
brown
sugar
banana
and
grapefruit
taste
is
crisp
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
accents
and
bitey
grapefruit
like
bitterness
toward
the
finish
the
after
taste
is
nice
lingers
medium
long
for
me
this
beer
is
an
on
or
off
beer
some
times
when
i
try
to
session
with
this
it
works
but
then
other
times
the
balance
just
doesnt
work
for
me
how
ever
more
often
than
not
i
truly
enjoy
this
beers
fruity
bitter
flavor
this
beer
was
more
like
an
apa
than
a
mild
ale
according
to
ba
descriptions
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
with
plenty
of
character
would
love
as
an
everyday
beer
but
those
3f
distribution
issues
update
just
got
another
batch
for
this
year
and
it
is
a
little
fresher
still
dry
in
the
finish
but
the
citrus
aspect
seems
a
little
more
prominent
than
what
i
remember
so
happy
i
was
able
to
snag
a
couple
cases
of
this
before
it
was
gone
in
my
area
totally
quaffable
in
every
sense
for
my
money
the
classic
american
session
mild
outstanding
drinkability
technically
the
alcohol
is
slightly
to
high
for
the
style
but
i
am
not
complaining
this
is
one
mild
and
tasty
ale
very
very
sessionable
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
am
a
little
thrown
off
by
the
word
mild
written
on
the
label
but
that
is
ok
because
it
is
a
good
beer
i
would
like
the
carbonation
to
be
a
bit
more
to
make
it
a
bit
more
drinkable
right
now
there
is
a
syrupy
edge
to
it
that
would
be
minimized
by
increased
carbonation
other
than
this
it
is
a
drinkable
pale
ale
d
there
really
isnt
much
mild
about
this
beer
unless
you
are
comparing
it
to
other
3f
beers
much
closer
to
an
american
pale
ale

malt
presence
to
be
found
taste
is
also
mainly
hops
but
the
malt
combines
to
present
an
enjoyable
brew
the
finish
balances
the
hops
and
malt
nicely
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
did
not
taste
ilke
an
english
dark
mild
ale
but
i
did
enjoy
it
drinkability
if
dreadnaught
is
too
much
for
you
this
is
your
brew
mild
enough
to
please
almost
everyone
yet
distinctive
enough
to
stand
out
of
the
crowd
overall
im
a
three
floyds
fanboy
but
then
again
isnt
everybody
these
days
i
was
back
before
they
were
on
the
radar
when
i
could
buy
this
beer
and
other
three
floyds
offerings
at
dz
six
pack
and
dogz
in
regent
square
the
swissvale
neighborhood
in
pittsburgh
d
drinkable
as
they
come
definitely
mild
and
refreshing
a
true
session
beer
cloudy
but
vibrant
medium
amber
with
a
1
cm
slightly
offwhite
creamy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thick
tenacious
film
smell
is
of
citric
hops
foremost
supported
by
herbal
tea
light
grain
pear
and
a
touch
of
leather
more
citrus
in
the
taste
a
little
stronger
but
still
far
from
overpowering
accompanied
by
a
moderate
bready
malt
presence
it
has
a
mediumthin
body
lightly
crisp
yet
fairly
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
this
beer
is
super
easydrinking
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
but
still
remaining
a
great
session
beer
very
nicely
done
one
of
the
better
mild
ales
out
there
thanks
for
the
bottle
hero27
drinkability
p
j
is
the
perfect
definition
of
a
session
beer
low
abv
crisp
and
dry
plenty
of
hoppiness
in
the
beginning
to
give
it
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
to
the
point
where
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
would
burn
out
your
taste
buds
make
a
point
to
seek
this
out
and
enjoy
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
i
like
to
drink
this
one
between
ipas
or
stouts
to
reset
the
palate
very
drinkable
and
tasty
i
think
when
compared
to
some
of
the
simply
spectacular
beers
made
by
3floyds
e
g
dreadnaught
this
beer
might
be
something
of
a
letdown
but
to
put
it
in
perspective
if
this
was
labeled
as
another
brewers
product
i
would
make
a
point
of
trying
everything
that
brewery
made
it
is
an
excellent
beer
i
am
glad
to
have
this
brewery
close
because
this
is
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
anytime
medium
bodied
light
effervescence
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
give
this
brew
a
nice
texture
on
the
palate
a
hoppyfloralcitrusy
aftertaste
completes
this
offering
overall
a
enjoyable
beer
from
the
floyds
i
love
this
beer
i
can
easily
down
12
of
these
in
one
night
as
for
the
folks
that
complain
about
it
not
being
a
true
english
mild
go
pick
up
a
sixer
of
fullers
esb
and
have
a
great
time
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
version
anyday
after
all
its
three
floyds
meaning
its
not
normal
just
what
their
six
packs
tell
you
drinkability
easy
to
drink
a
wonderful
allaround
session
beer
and
another
winner
from
fff
i
can
only
see
to
get
this
and
robert
the
bruce
regularly
while
im
in
des
moines
this
summer
so
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
plenty
of
this
one
of
the
most
satisfying
and
easily
drinkable
beers
i
know
my
favorite
by
far
of
the
three
floyds
regular
beers
as
for
being
a
mild
i
belive
fff
are
employing
the
old
english
tradition
in
which
mild
and
bitter
were
relative
terms
used
to
describe
each
particular
brewerys
offerings
and
compared
to
alpha
king
this
baby
is
mild
uf
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
with
a
little
white
head
that
drops
away
over
time
some
citrus
hops
are
in
effect
on
the
nose
the
taste
follows
it
with
some
more
american
citrus
hops
refreshing
and
not
too
thick
on
the
mouth
with
mild
carbonation
a
little
malt
grain
underneath
it
all
overall
seems
an
awful
lot
like
an
apa
tasty
but
not
the
english
dark
mild
i
was
expecting
this
beer
is
a
nice
version
of
a
mildly
hopped
apa
i
dont
know
why
it
is
in
the
english
dark
mild
catagory
however
it
is
a
great
session
brew
i
plan
to
work
this
into
my
regular
rotation
for
summer
note
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
a
mild
ale
this
is
fff
and
it
is
not
normal
a
great
beer
overall
but
mislabled
in
style
d
nice
and
not
overpowering
could
easily
be
a
session
brew
but
today
the
alcohol
hit
be
a
little
bit
for
some
reason
d
session
session
session
everything
youd
expect
from
a
mild
a
nice
pleasant
flavor
with
some
quenching
capabilities
and
a
clean
finish
thanks
mabz
for
this
great
beer
overall
a
very
wonderfully
smelling
delicious
session
brew
ill
definitely
have
to
stock
up
on
this
for
grilling
season
would
love
to
see
how
guests
react
to
this
easygoing
ale
drinkability
this
is
easy
going
down
and
a
good
beer
i
would
have
several
more
in
any
one
sitting
overall
impression
not
all
that
sessionable
not
at
all
a
mild
either
way
too
overhopped
i
guess
i
should
try
the
bottled
version
to
see
if
the
hops
are
muted
any
further
can
three
floyds
make
a
beer
without
overhopping
it
not
bad
but
it
seems
these
are
the
only
kinds
of
beers
they
can
make
worth
a
try
got
to
knock
off
a
few
points
just
bc
its
so
far
off
this
is
my
first
beer
from
three
floyds
provided
to
me
by
fugazme
it
pours
up
a
crystal
clear
honey
gold
color
nice
head
up
to
two
fingers
and
falls
quickly
down
to
a
cap
on
the
beer
minimal
lacing
with
this
one
the
smell
is
faint
sweet
and
grainy
with
some
hop
background
the
taste
is
nice
a
refreshing
sweet
taste
up
front
fruity
with
strawberries
the
middle
leaves
way
to
more
of
a
tangy
citrus
zest
the
finish
hits
you
with
a
nice
mild
hop
kick
not
bad
a
very
solid
offering
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
full
and
creamy
with
a
tingle
of
trapped
carbonation
on
the
tounge
and
cheek
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
sans
hop
kick
this
is
mass
marketable
with
the
hop
kick
it
makes
for
a
sessionable
beer
destine
for
garage
fridges
the
ba
world
over
or
at
least
in
the
midwest
check
it
out
if
you
can
verdict
its
not
revolutionary
but
its
ohsodrinkable
this
practically
screams
session
beer
body
is
lightish
with
pretty
standard
carbonation
defintely
cant
complain
mouthfeel
is
right
on
target
leading
to
a
very
drinkable
hoppy
brew
d
this
is
a
great
hoppy
session
beer
the
big
hops
are
all
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
and
they
play
well
with
the
malt
that
comes
through
the
bittering
hops
stay
in
the
background
only
to
add
a
nice
finish
to
this
beer
all
the
flavors
are
distinct
and
fresh
giving
good
complexity
under
5abv
wellbuilt
and
well
handled
this
is
an
inspired
beer
the
fresher
the
better
for
this
gem
this
is
the
type
of
session
beer
ive
been
looking
for
its
complexity
and
flavor
at
4
8
blows
my
mind
this
would
be
my
lawnmower
beer
if
i
had
to
choose
one
so
flavorful
and
balanced
even
though
ive
only
had
two
the
robert
the
bruce
scottish
is
also
available
here
in
jersey
of
3
floyds
offerings
i
love
what
they
bring
to
the
table
nice
mix
of
hops
a
full
citrus
flavor
and
aroma
and
a
finely
crafted
easily
drinkable
set
of
brews
cheers
to
the
hoosier
states
finest
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
floral
hops
with
a
good
malt
presence
balance
between
the
floral
hops
and
the
semisweet
malt
is
very
interesting
the
above
average
body
is
also
very
enjoyable
if
i
were
to
rate
this
per
the
style
i
would
probably
rate
this
very
low
because
this
hoppy
beer
does
not
remind
me
of
a
mild
or
a
bitter
but
since
im
rating
this
solely
on
what
i
tasted
i
can
say
that
without
being
a
great
beer
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
12
oz
bottleconditioned
served
in
a
nonic
it
pours
a
hazed
caramelbronze
wtih
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
it
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
citricpiney
hops
tastes
kinda
like
a
pale
ale
but
without
as
full
of
a
body
but
its
still
smooth
and
it
has
that
american
citric
grapefruit
hop
character
with
some
leafy
bitterness
overall
not
very
mild
in
any
respect
except
the
alcohol
content
and
im
fairly
sure
its
not
what
an
english
mild
should
be
even
though
this
is
my
first
example
of
the
style
it
is
however
very
sessionable
as
they
mention
on
the
bottle
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
expensive
to
make
it
a
regular
session
ale
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
it
is
one
of
three
floyds
lesser
offerings
imho
however
there
is
nothing
mild
or
english
about
it
it
is
highly
drinkable
in
fact
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
was
dissapointed
by
the
thin
mouthfeel
the
beer
does
have
the
toffeemalt
thing
going
on
but
it
is
dwarfed
by
the
strong
citrusy
hop
profile
i
could
definitely
imagine
throwing
back
many
of
these
on
a
summer
day
for
it
is
definitely
better
than
the
majority
of
summer
ales
on
the
market
this
beer
poured
a
bright
and
clear
amber
to
copper
color
topped
by
a
light
fluffy
eggwhite
head
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
up
front
punch
of
hops
in
the
aroma
columbus
with
a
nice
malty
back
of
toffee
the
taste
is
very
citrusy
up
front
the
grapefruit
rind
from
the
hops
melds
well
with
the
malt
in
the
form
of
dark
carmel
to
provide
a
pleasant
flavor
the
finish
is
all
hops
its
amazing
that
this
beer
passes
as
a
mild
its
more
of
an
ipa
of
course
all
3f
beers
go
over
the
top
on
the
hops
but
i
do
enjoy
them
the
mouth
feel
is
slick
and
refreshing
great
drinkability
wonderful
beer
and
quite
drinkable
at
less
than
5
abv
crisp
and
clean
lightbodied
and
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
bit
of
malty
sweetness
then
a
hoppy
aftertaste
ridiculously
drinkable
nothing
that
blows
you
away
but
a
very
enjoyable
brew
the
craft
beer
lovers
lawnmower
beer
soft
amber
color
with
loads
of
lacing
and
a
thick
head
intense
carbonation
aromas
of
white
grapes
spices
hops
and
caramel
slightly
offbalance
with
minimal
hops
but
still
tastey
a
semisweet
toasted
flavor
dominates
although
it
is
somewhat
subtle
good
mouthfeel
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
mild
for
continued
drinking
i
would
want
more
flavors
ahhh
spring
when
a
bas
mind
turns
away
from
the
warming
darkness
of
doppelbocks
and
imperial
stouts
and
towards
the
subtle
wonder
of
lighter
hoppier
beers
pride
and
joy
embodies
the
best
traits
of
a
first
day
of
spring
beer
it
is
a
pleasant
bronze
whose
nose
is
just
a
whiff
of
hops
then
the
first
sip
gently
massages
your
tongue
with
mild
english
hops
and
a
light
friendly
maltiness
ahhhh
sitting
on
my
porch
drinkin
a
beer
is
there
anything
finer
not
a
mild
ale
at
all
really
this
is
definately
a
pale
ale
just
a
pretty
damn
good
balanced
session
beer
drinkability
is
high
this
is
so
approachable
and
major
props
to
3f
for
applying
craft
skills
to
a
lowalcohol
lowerflavor
ale
that
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
but
instead
is
a
masterpiece
of
delicate
flavors
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
american
version
of
a
british
mild
i
guess
it
is
mild
and
the
lighter
color
and
hop
focus
are
american
but
whats
british
about
it
just
call
it
an
american
mild
and
it
is
set
dark
clear
orange
color
with
medium
carbonation
present
and
a
small
offwhite
head
fairly
hoppy
smells
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
seemingly
present
in
most
of
three
floyds
beers
interesting
tastes
of
caramel
malts
and
bits
of
a
maltier
or
nuttier
malts
strange
brew
that
i
cannot
place
it
seems
to
be
following
an
english
style
but
the
hops
really
throw
me
for
a
loop
there
is
a
hoppiness
that
leans
toward
a
pale
ale
but
then
again
it
is
a
bit
maltier
sweet
tangy
tastes
are
very
appealing
and
this
is
quite
a
good
session
brew
the
aftertaste
is
on
the
dry
side
and
still
hoppy
citrus
overall
a
pleasing
beer
that
three
floyds
makes
here
this
would
probably
be
a
great
spring
morning
beer
drinkabilitynotes
an
interesting
interpretation
of
a
familiar
style
quite
drinkable
and
presumably
a
hopheads
delight
i
dont
think
this
is
necessarily
true
to
the
mild
ale
style
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
aftertaste
is
a
bit
biting
and
dry
but
this
beer
has
a
good
full
mouthfeel
and
i
may
not
be
able
to
save
the
other
one
to
take
home
this
nifty
little
brew
pours
a
nice
sort
of
orange
copper
tone
on
the
amber
colour
scale
it
was
aggressively
poured
to
form
a
head
that
was
not
a
lasting
feature
i
do
have
a
small
foamy
cap
currently
poised
on
top
of
my
beer
it
looks
like
it
is
planning
to
stick
around
and
it
is
also
giving
off
some
decent
lace
the
nose
holds
a
nice
juicy
hop
character
smells
predominantly
of
lemon
the
malt
character
is
overshadowed
by
this
hop
influence
as
both
are
mild
as
expected
with
the
malt
being
more
contained
off
the
sniff
the
hop
character
is
much
more
active
it
smells
really
pleasing
i
couldnt
imagine
anyone
not
enjoying
a
little
whiff
of
this
one
the
taste
is
so
easy
this
really
is
a
perfect
sessioner
it
has
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
and
the
lemony
citrus
of
hops
but
on
a
more
universally
appealing
scale
a
bit
of
yeasty
influence
rides
along
with
the
lightly
proportioned
malt
backdrop
i
can
easily
envision
driving
around
on
a
riding
lawnmower
in
the
heat
with
a
glass
of
this
in
my
hand
my
mom
might
even
enjoy
it
mild
is
a
perfect
description
and
style
classification
it
is
hard
not
to
love
this
even
if
bigger
beers
are
your
favorite
implement
in
the
arsenal
just
right
thanks
to
fellow
ba
unclejimbo
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
appearance
slightly
cloudy
orange
amber
cream
colored
head
disappeared
quickly
and
i
have
no
head
left
bubbles
on
the
bottom
of
my
glass
rise
slowly
smell
prominent
malt
but
some
earthy
notes
i
am
also
picking
up
low
grapefruity
hop
notes
taste
the
earthy
note
i
picked
up
on
earlier
is
at
the
front
again
followed
by
low
malt
and
a
trickle
of
citrusy
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
the
best
feature
small
tickly
carbonation
not
too
thin
drinkability
not
as
much
a
gotta
get
that
again
brew
as
the
abv
promised
imo
d
i
need
a
barrel
of
this
on
tap
at
home
after
this
i
truly
understand
the
meaning
of
a
session
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
come
back
for
more
the
next
day
awesome
brew
that
needs
to
be
tried
i
cannot
believe
how
many
times
i
have
walked
by
this
on
the
shelves
it
will
become
a
future
staple
in
my
fridge
a
very
poundable
brew
obviously
has
session
written
all
over
it
when
i
think
of
mild
i
think
more
dark
and
less
hoppy
but
this
is
a
delicious
beer
no
matter
what
malt
and
hops
of
this
one
work
very
well
together
orangish
hue
with
about
a
finger
of
head
some
sticky
lacing
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
some
grassy
hops
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
pretty
well
balanced
flavor
the
hops
stand
out
just
a
bit
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
this
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
if
it
was
available
to
me
all
the
time
i
would
have
called
this
a
classic
pilsner
knid
of
similar
to
prima
pils
from
victory
but
ba
calls
it
an
english
dark
mild
i
cant
tell
whats
what
anymore
this
mild
ale
poured
a
clear
coppery
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
and
clung
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
a
little
bit
the
smell
was
nicely
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
as
well
and
nice
crystal
malt
with
a
note
of
caramel
the
taste
was
mildly
malty
crystal
malt
with
a
good
hoppiness
only
mildly
bitter
together
with
a
light
fruitiness
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
hoppiness
lingered
this
was
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
mild
i
want
more
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
illinois
to
get
it
i
would
drink
this
all
of
the
time
although
its
a
stretch
to
call
this
an
english
mild
it
is
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
drinkable
3
drink
minimum
mouthfeel
is
average
pretty
carbonated
but
smooth
enough
to
not
stop
drinking
just
a
little
less
bitter
and
citrusy
and
a
little
more
malt
and
this
beer
would
be
superb
in
my
opinion
as
it
is
now
it
is
a
great
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
not
quite
as
crisp
as
it
could
be
overall
impression
outstanding
session
beer
hops
on
top
make
pop
hop
wish
it
was
local
id
drink
it
all
the
time
thanks
again
to
rick
for
carting
back
a
bottle
from
the
heartland
this
one
is
great
tasting
and
highly
drinkable
its
a
touch
overlysweet
at
times
or
id
have
bumped
the
drinkablility
score
up
a
touch
more
definitely
worth
a
try
could
be
a
new
style
american
mild
sorry
for
the
low
score
but
this
is
not
a
mild
this
is
definately
a
pale
ale
or
an
ipa
or
something
in
that
family
it
is
an
excellent
well
made
beer
but
not
a
mild
the
pour
is
bright
copper
color
with
a
full
white
head
and
lace
on
the
glass
nice
ahint
of
malt
introduces
the
flavor
before
the
hop
assault
starts
the
beer
is
crisp
and
very
dry
and
dries
out
even
more
in
the
finish
a
nice
pale
ale
definitely
not
to
style
as
a
mild
ale
but
still
a
damn
fine
beer
to
drink
definitely
a
three
floyds
brew
with
lots
of
potent
hops
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
but
it
cleared
quite
nicely
though
not
much
of
a
head
but
some
nice
carbonation
that
gives
this
beer
a
nice
medium
feeling
body
low
abv
would
make
this
a
great
session
beer0but
be
aware
of
the
hops
because
it
might
throw
those
taste
buds
for
a
bit
of
a
loop
nose
is
hops
and
the
deep
woods
of
maine
think
wet
wood
flavor
is
at
first
malty
but
with
a
nice
plump
hop
bite
throughout
this
beer
lots
of
overrripe
citrus
rinds
around
this
beer
as
well
12
oz
bottle
tones
of
pungant
hops
very
little
malt
character
pour
pale
with
an
orangebrown
hue
very
little
head
and
no
lace
massive
hop
flavor
but
still
no
real
malt
present
super
bitter
kind
of
makes
me
cringe
to
swallow
light
body
pretty
puckering
not
real
easy
to
drink
by
far
my
least
favorite
3f
brew
im
sure
glad
the
rest
are
pretty
great
i
hate
to
pan
any
beer
but
i
feel
that
in
this
case
i
have
to
reading
the
beer
style
description
this
beer
by
no
means
is
a
mild
ale
i
think
this
beer
would
be
better
off
as
a
ipa
instead
extremely
hoppy
for
a
mild
ale
and
not
as
dark
as
i
thought
it
should
be
a
bit
thin
in
body
and
a
little
too
much
floral
in
the
nose
sorry
three
floyds
i
think
you
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
drinkability
this
could
certainly
turn
into
a
session
beer
as
its
not
loaded
with
malt
or
hops
has
enough
taste
to
not
overwhelm
the
palate
and
also
doesnt
have
a
high
abv
it
would
probably
go
well
with
a
meal
too
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
buy
it
again
shhh
this
is
really
nothing
like
a
british
mild
despite
the
way
the
brewer
describes
the
beer
dont
tell
anyone
because
then
they
might
change
the
recipe
which
would
be
ashame
this
beer
has
an
enjoyable
distinct
orange
smell
and
a
good
hops
kick
to
balance
the
citrus
and
sweet
tastes
the
hops
also
have
a
little
bit
of
a
husky
taste
maybe
its
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
im
just
focused
on
the
nice
lacing
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
suprisingly
strong
for
such
a
small
beer
sweet
and
citrusy
it
is
quite
pleasant
taste
is
kind
of
hoppy
but
very
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
overall
this
is
an
alright
brew
i
could
see
this
being
the
perfect
beer
to
have
with
lunch
while
at
work
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
nothing
spectacular
but
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
was
such
that
i
would
gladly
have
another
a
mild
alewell
not
so
sure
about
thatpours
a
rich
copper
with
a
nice
white

leaves

mild
aromas
going
on
here
pineyresiny
hop
with
slight
caramel
malt
note
in
the
background
a
tad
watery
mouthfeel
but
not
to
thin
mild
flavors
for
three
floyds
i
suppose
lightly
sweet
and
caramelly
but
that
pineyresiny
american
hop
presence
is
there
make
this
well
balanced
and
oh
so
quaffable
i
could
drink
this
ale
all
day
has
nice
flavors
and
ind
goes
down
like
watera
traditional
mild
no
but
a
damn
good
american
style
mild
oh
hell
yeah
drinkability
even
with
the
watery
aspect
its
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
in
the
future
quite
a
good
session
beer
as
well
i
would
assume
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
very
little
head
and
carbonation
all
i
can
smell
is
the
hops
man
is
it
strong
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
very
bitter
with
mild
malt
flavor
too
bitter
for
me
i
didnt
think
a
english
dark
mild
would
ever
be
this
bitter
drinkability
would
be
higher
but
the
bitterness
is
too
much
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
have
this
again
beer
is
good
happy
beering
nice
sticky
head
atop
this
amber
sea
of
hoppiness
mild
yes
hoppy
yes
i
cant
righly
say
if
its
too
hoppy
or
just
right
in
the
mild
department
definitley
hoppy
characteristics
up
front
lip
smacking
hops
as
a
matter
of
fact
sweet
with
matching
hop
bitterness
a
nice
little
brew
from
indiana
this
is
quite
drinkable
a
nice
beer
to
have
about
the
house
for
any
old
situation
this
one
is
very
hoppy
taste
of
floral
hops
hints
of
grapefruit
or
orange
peel
lightly
fruity
malt
very
crisp
and
a
long
lingering
bitterness
bitterness
is
very
persistent
not
a
traditonal
mild
not
with
all
those
hops
dominating
but
it
is
tasty
and
at
less
than
5
it
would
make
a
serviceable
session
beer
copper
in
colour
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
and
prodigious
aromas
of
malt
brioche
orangelemon
and
pine
clean
malty
flavor
with
noticeable
hops
on
the
mid
and
finish
not
at
all
heavy
but
clean
smooth
and
delicious
perhaps
a
touch
aggressive
for
a
mild
but
i
guess
in
relation
the
the
average
3
floyds
brew
this
is
a
mild
after
all
a
serviceable
bitter
and
we
dont
need
boldness
and
high
alcohol
to
clean
the
palate
crisp
good
carbonation
florl

and
lemonade
a
changeup

be
fooled
by
the
numbers
in

of
the
bold

to
me
to
be

lots

also
in
the
taste
but
still
seemed
to
much
floral
hops
for
a
mild

still
a
nice
medium
bodied
summer
brew
to
go
along
with
the
bbqing
big
fluffy
head
and
copper
in

this
smells
of
carmalized

hops
the
taste
has
tons
of

notes
of
banana
big

to
this
brew
with
loads
of
flavor
that
keeps
delivering
hop
blast

blast
from
start

this
body
is
deep
it
keeps
filling
the
palate
with
all
of

pine
coats
your

like

excellent

i
personally
dont

a

is
more
of
the
carry
over
from
the
aroma
citric
zing
with
a
noticeable

that
helps
this
one
end
clean
and

dry
its
a
strange
tiwst
on
a
mild
to
be
sure
not
reserved
but
not
over
the
top
decent
mouthfeel
and
very
very
drinkable
is
this
a
mild
according
to
3f
it
is
maybe
a
candidate
for
conversion
of
the
masses
a
great
summer
mild
ale
who
are
they
trying
to
kid
its
a
flavorful
pale
ale
or
solid
ipa
with
as
much
flavor
this
brew
has
but
theyre
right
about
it
being
a
great

thirst

yet
to
disappoint
this
is
my
first
of
4
three
floyds
that
my
brother
brought
me
from
indiana
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
these
for
a
while
now
pours
a
cloudy

with
a
minimal

that
dissipates
quickly
wonderful
hops
citrus
smell
is
this
a
mild
ale
or
an

hops
bitterness
dominates
up
front
but
is
balanced
nicely
smooth
finish
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
of
this
if
this
is
what
three
floyds
has
to
offer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
hop
bitterness
is
perfect
and
along
with
the
medium
light
mouth
feel
supported
by
moderate
carbonation
this
could
be
the
perfect
session
beer
for
baseball
coaches
or
anyone
looking
for
a
quality
thirst
quencher
very
tasty
and
quaffable
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
also
has
an
intense
hop
aroma
that
really
makes
this
beer
it
is
well
balanced
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
solid
malt
core
that
lays
a
base
for
the
hops
in
the
taste
and
finish
it
is
quite
bitter
but
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
brew
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
good
aroma
another
solid
beer
from
three
floyds
this
is
not
exactly
the
standard
for
englis
dark
mild
not
at
all
what
you
might
expect
from
the
name
however
three
floyds
is
the
brewer
that
calls
alpha
king
only
a
pale
ale
not
an
ipa
so
its
not
terrible
surprising
to
find
that
their
mild
smells
of
grapefruit
whatever
this
may
not
be
classicly
to
style
but
it
is
a
damn
fine
beer

the

of
spicy
and
fruity
hops
immediately
the
beer
tastes
skinny
there
is
definitely
a
caramel
malt
flavor
behind
the
hops
that
seems
to
linger
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
very
refreshing
with
a
nice
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
wonderful
example
of
a
an
english
mild
with
an
american
twist
the
word
mild
on
the
label
is
somewhat
misleading
well
mild
in
comparison
maybe
pours

mainly
bitter

taste
is
of

with
some

characteristics
citrus

with
a
moderate

very
drinkable
this
is
probably
my
favorite
social
beer
because
i
can
have
a
few
of
them
and
enjoy
every
pint
without
being
completely
blasted

if
i
like

a
full
boquet
of

spicey
and
citrusy
mouthwatering
the
flavor
is
lighter
than
the
aroma
leads
you
to
belive
it
starts
with
a
nice
citrusy

character
with
mild

in
the
middle
and

smoothly
with
the

the

aroma
may
scare
some
but
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
hoppy
yes
but
not
agressively
so
drinkable
hell
yeah
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
very
likable
that
is
a
deadly
combination
i
purchased
one
bottle
one
bottle
idiot
in
iowa
city
ia
in
the
future
this
will
be
a
sixpack
purchase
i
recommend
this
beer
buy
some
before
i
buy
it
all
this
is
an
american
pale
ale
and
a
damn
fine
one
or
perhaps
what
a
small
beer
made
from
dreadnaughts
sloppy
seconds
might
taste
like
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed

38

is
citrusy
yet
piney
with
a
light
undercurrent
of

taste
starts
with
pale
malt
sweetness
giving
way
to
the
pine
and
citrus
notes
of
the
hops
well
balanced
with
a
lean
ot
the
hops
but
not
to
its
detriment
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
a
beer
made
to
session
nice
to
see
an
what
should
be
classified
an
american
mild
probably
more
hops
character
here
than
the
uk
would
expect
check
it
out
if
you
can
pours

sparkling
golden
color
with
a
small

fizzy

is
citric
definitely
grapefruit
classic
cascade
nose
taste
is
of
slight
caramel
the
malt
backbone
is
not
very
large
but
stands
up
to
balance
out
the
citric
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
but
very
drinkable
english
nah
drinkable
hell
yea
this
is
the
epitome
of
session
i
really
recommend
giving
this
a
try
even
though
this
in
my
opinion
is
more
of
an
apa
than
an
english
mild
it
is
darn
good
extremely
drinkable
now
if
i
could
just
get
this
from
a
cask
pours
a
pale
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
very
floral
and
spicy
aroma
slightly
smoky
taste
is
of
citric
hops
and
pine
resin
mellowing
out
and
sweetening
as
it
warms
feels
thin
and
oily
on
the
palate
but
not
offensive
in
the
least
this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
is
hoppy
enough
to
be
an
ipa
theres
nothing
like
waking
up
with
nothing
to
do
on
a
saturday
morning
im
beginning
the
day
with
a
nice
session
mild
or
so
it
says
on
the
bottle
this
beer
is
no
mild
it
might
even
pass
for
an
ipa
pours

good
carbonation
lively
body
very
hoppy
aroma
with
notes
of
citric
grapefruit
and
theres
a
nutty
yeast
note
in
there
as
well
taste
has
more
citric
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
the
grapefruit
goes
away
sweet
english
toffee
and
lightly
roasted
nuts
underneath
the
initial
alpha
acid
assault
finish
is
dry
and
lingering
in
hop
bitterness
but
its
soft
as
well
very
sessionable
but
the
malt
doesnt
quite
hold
up
enough
and
the
hops
are
more
bittering
than
flavoring
still
really
really
easy
drinking
stuff
thanks
craig
the
taste
is
as
the
smell
prescribed
i
think
i
have
found
me
a
new
favorite
session
beer
and
ill
be
damned
if
i
dont
convince
my
friends
of
the
same
at
an
abv
of
under
5
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
will
definitely
do
so
in
the
future
i
cant
believe
i
have
passed
this
up
so
many
times
so
why
are
you
still
reading
this
when
you
could
be
out
buying
some
more
beer
to
supplement
your
beer
fridge
ng
sampled
from
the
beer
engine
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
my
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
i
saw
the
board
saying
this
was
on
the
engine
when
i
was
there
how
did
it
take
me
3
beers
into
the
night
to
see
that
this
was
there
it
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
full
of
large
bubbles
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
a
nice
blend
of
grapefruity
hop
and
a
slight
chewy
bubblygum
it
was
slightly
crisp
but
smelld
divine
cask
conditioning
this
beer
took
it
to
places
that
i
didnt
know
existed
the
flavor
was
mellow
a
great
blend
of
the
grapefruit
hop
and
the
caramel
sweetness
this
is
what
i
will
hold
all
mild
ales
up
against
in
flavor
it
was
mild
yet
so
full
of
flavor
the
feel
was
so
smooth
and
silky
with
just
a
bare
minimum
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
true
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
fantastic
im
not
sure
there
is
anything
they
can
do
withthe
flavor
to
make
it
better
i
can
only
hope
that
next
time
i
am
there
they
have
the
alpha
king
on
cask
smooth
and
ohso
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
so
easily
if
you
think
pride
joy
is
a
good
session
ale
out
of
the
bottle
just
try
it
on
cask
and
be
blown
away
this
one
could
be
drank
all
night
long
with
no
problem
simply
a
great
beer
by
three
floyds
made
even
better
on
cask
highly
recommended
carbonation
out
the
yingyang
it
hits
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
kills
alot
of
flavors
as
well
as
teh
temperature
served
chilled
hurt
this
one
a
bit
i
think
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
light
body
definitely
a
nice
springsummer
brew
id
like
to
say
i
liked
this
one
but
i
would
be
a
liar
ive
had
better
this
is
a
mild
ale
with
3floyds
hop
profile
its
not
a
hop
monster
its
a
very
solid
brew
to
quaff
when
you
dont
want
alot
of
alcohol
an
extremely
tasty
brew
that
could
make
a
fine
session
beer
although
it
is
a
tad
pricey
im
buying
it
again
this
ale
is
not
mild
by
most
standards
if
anything
this
is
just
a
lighter
version
of
their
alpha
king
the
taste
is
very
good
as
i
stated
before
it
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
semiregular
basis
good
for
parties
etc
not
only
for
the
taste
but
the
label
artwork
is
a
conversation
starter
as
is
all
artwork
on
three
floyds
bottles
12
ounce
bottle
the
only
thing
mild
about
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
the
aroma
is
pure
hops
of
course
it
says
as
much
on
the
label
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
and
a
beer
that
really
has
no
style
when
i
think
mild
as
the
flavor
is
very
interesting
but
not
overblown
gavagedec
12
so
this
level
of
pacnw
hops
on
the
nose
tells
me
this
isnt
a
typical
mild
drinking
this
beer
leaves
me
a
little
bewildered
i
love
hops
just
as
much
as
the
next
guy
it
will
satisfy
your
craving
for
hops
and
you
can
sip
on
it
forever
without
getting
out
of
hand
but
i
wish
that
there
was
some
of
that
malty
complexity
that
one
gets
from
a
traditional
mild
ale
in
the
end
though
this
beer
does
taste
quite
good

but
still
another
great
beer
from
the
floyds
i
agree
with
their
desciption
on
the
bottle
that
this
is
a
great
session
beer
as
the
flavor
combines
for
a
nice
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
very
good

beautifully
blended

great
color
and

a
number
one
choice
to
me
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
amber
very
well
balanced
between
hop
and
malt
although
a
tad
maltier
to
my
palette
very
good
but
cant
believe
it
goes
for
20
a
sixer
probably
one
of
the
best
balanced
apas
ive
had
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
little
sumpin
sumpin
with
the
strong

smell
and
taste
this
is
a
tiny
bit
more
toned
down
and
refined
though
very
good
apa
would
probably
be
one
of
my
gotos
if
it
were
readily
available
this
is
bland
and
boring
nothing
special
wow
thats
unique
for

thanks
to

for
sending
this
to
me
a
american
pale
ale
with
slight
caramel
sweetness
balanced
by
aggressive
citrus
hoppiness
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
find
yourself
not
able
to
put
down
because
the
flavors
become
more
complex
as
you
drink
the
beer
my
first
beer
from
3
floyds
and
i
can
always
tell
i
will
now
be
apart
of
their
cult
following
acquired
a
fresher
bottle
for
my
second
tasting
of
this
3
floyds
gem
bumping
my
initial
rating
up
by
13
from
4
13
to
4
26
possibly
the
best
flagship
out
there
wish
i
could
read
the
bottled
on
date
i
can
see
2015
but
could
be
anywhere
from
a
month
to
a
month
and
a
half
old
the
beer
doesnt
hold
up
that
well
it
seems
alpha
king
is
a
great
beer
it
delivers
what
you
would
expect
from
a
well
crafted
apa
the
aromas
are
bananas
and
the
taste
is
complex
enjoy
it
on
tap
delicious
with
hints
of
caramel
hop
spices
was
and
a
brown
sugar
apple
sweetness
i
really
liked
this
beer
love
the
little
bitter

taste
great
beer
by
3
floyds
o
unfortunately
im
in
ohio
and
this
is
not
available
at
any
of
the
stores
i
frequent
or
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
unavailable
outside
of
bars
but
i
would
but
this
regularly
if
it
was
easily
available
a
fine
experience
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
topped
by
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
nose
is
aromatic
earthypiney
hops
but
not
smashing
in
your
face
quite
a
reserved
hop
profile
that
mixes
well
into
the
malty
sweetness
the
beer
drink
with
a
malt
sweetness
upfront
which
quickly
transitions
into
modestly
bitter
and
flavorful
hops
that
linger
its
well
carbonated
has
balanced
malthop
character
a
pleasant
aftertaste
minimal
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
bready
yeast
this
is
a
pretty
crushable
beer
balanced
and
with
good
availability
id
definitely
recommend
outstanding
pale
ale
bursting
with
flavor
in
a
somewhat
aggressivelyhopped
fashion
way
to
hoppy
for
my
taste
seems
overly
bitter
tried
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
a

poured
into
a

remind
me
of
a
not

strong
variant

dust
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
drinks
easy
enough
for
me
to
go
through
a
six
pack
but
packs
enough
flavor
to
keep
it

was

i

i
feel
that
for

three

good
stuff
i
wish
i
could
get
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
rather
than
having
to
beg
for
a
trade
had
on
tap
in
indy
overall
great
apa
wish
i
could
get
this
back
east
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
the
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
are
so
well
balanced
that
it
remains
incredibly
drinkable

still
being

personally
find

equally

from
a

on

yes
please
salute
had
on

was
very
good
after
reading
several
reviews
about
how
this
beer
can
be
difficult
to
find
i
suppose
i
should
be
grateful
that
it
is
so
plentiful
in
my
town
north
of
indy
i
have
this
a
few
times
a
month
on
draft
and
it
is
always
excellent
perhaps
the
best
balanced
apa
ive
had
aggressively
hopped
with
fantastic
citrus
and
caramel
at
the
same
time
one
of
so
many
great
three
floyds
offerings
believe
it
or
not
this
one
can
be
had
for
3
a
pint
or
less
yearround
at
two
bars
in
my
town
very
tasty

definitely
worthy
of
its

a
subtle

poured
into

glass
slightly

and
absolutely
zero
floaties
most
refreshing
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
overall
underwhelmed
a
little
very
nice
but
i
am
glad
i
didnt
seek
this
out
it
was
just
in
the
fridge
at
my
local
whole
foods
given
the
2
or
3
premium
compared
to
similar
pale
ales
i
dont
think
this
is
worth
it
but
if
i
ever
saw
it
on
tap
i
would
have
again
on
draft
i
cant
quite
understand
the
hype
that
surrounds
this
beer
thin
weak
and
onenoted
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
overall
with
tons
of
great
flavors
and
a
nice
hop
blend
this
is
renowned
for
a
reason
it
is
very
good
more
like
a
american
ipa
very
complex
with
great
ipa
characters
looks
beautiful
feels
beautiful
deep
amber
almost
brown
with
plenty
of
head
and
sticky
lace
the
likes
of
which
are
unexpected
outside
of
the
draft
world
creamy
smooth
medium
low
carbonation
and
medium
high

gives
it
a
big

and
very
soft

decently
balanced

a
nice
inbetween
all

and
dipas
wouldnt
call
it
intense
aroma
though
more
understated
and
consistent
with
the
flavor
o
i
love
that
this
is
a
fairly
highhop
flavorbitterness
beer
that
also
really
accentuates
the
malt
which
is
very
flavorful
without
being
overly
sweet
i
think
its
equally
fit
for
summer
bbqs
and
late
fall
campfires
really
excellent
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
a
good
solid
goto
beer
since
it
is
easily
available
year
round
in
wisconsin
pours
a
light
amber
color
good
floral
smell
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
o
now
that
ive
had
2
years
to
get
over
the
three
floyds
hype
try
many
different
other
pale
ales
from
across
the
country
revisiting
their
flagship
beer
on
a
whim
was
a
great
decision
this
is
a
very
complex
but
balanced
pale
ale
with
quite
a
bit
of
great
fruity
flavours
slightly
expensive
at
126pack
but
then
again
the
quality
of
this
beer
is
just
as
good
as
the
ones
youd
have
to
buy
in
bombers
and
is
still
a
better
deal

a
lot
of
great
beers
people
forget
about
this
one
o
one
of
my
favorites
and
you
can
get
it
just
by
asking
from
my
home
town
area
great
beer
overall
fantastic
super
hoppy
it
does
what
it
set
out
to
do
fantastically

i
know
this
is
not
an
ipa
but
you
sure
would
think
it
was
when
you
first
put
it
to
your
lips
very
bold
and
has
a
very
distinctive
one
of
my
new
favorites
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
great
flavor
without
the
typical
hoppy
pale
bite
very
full
and
enjoyable
light
brown
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
haziness
theres
a
good
inch
thick
tightly
knit
layer
of
khaki
colored
head
brussels
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
cereal
grains
the
flavor
is
a
bold
burst
of
cereal
grains
and
subtle
hops
that
blend
to
give
it
almost
a
copper
like
bitterness
theres
a
slightly
chalky
note
in
the
mouth
o
exquisite
par
excellence
three
floyds
you
are
king
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
settled
slowly
to
a
creamy
collar
and
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
bread
biscuits
and
caramel
along
with
some
floral
spicy
hops
the
taste
follows
suit
with
again
a
really
nice
balance
the
malt
presents
as
nice
and
toasty
some
bread
and
sweet
caramel
the
hops
were
difficult
for
me
to
tweeze
out
and
presented
more
as
those
great
west
coast
spicy
and
floral
bouquet
it
has
a
easy
drinking
body
yet
is
still
round
and
creamy
with
enough
carb
to
lighten
but
not
too
much
overall
i
was
impressed
with
the
balance
fff
achieves
with
this
brew
and
the
depth
of
flavor
considering
its
lowish
abv
overall
a
welldeserved
knockout
4
5
for
alpha
king
pale
ale
from
three
floyds
brewing
co
brewpub
this
had
enough
bite
to
taste
and
went
away
as
i
finished
the
sips
the
clean
finish
made
this
very
refreshing
i
will
undeniably
buy
this
brew
again
overall
perhaps
a
bit
more
british
than
american
in
style
but
packed
with
plenty
of
fresh
citrus
hop
goodness
o
another
great
pale
from
fff
cheers
kristine
and
brian
so
is
it
a
balanced
ipa
that
makes
the
perfect
ale
or
is
it
a
hop
forward
pale
ale
regardless
this
could
be
the
epitome
of
american
ale
period
o
straightup
bitter
and
hoppy
beer
that
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
taste
is
amazing
malty
for
sure
but
still
well
balanced
with
all
kinds
of
hops
bitterness
this
is
the
best
tasting
pale
ale
ever
the
aftertaste
is
sad
because
the
ale
is
going
away
otherwise
it
too
is
sublime
with
malts
and
hops
staying
on
the
tongue
for
a
long
time
it
tastes
as
though
the
alcohol
would
preclude
you
from
drinking
more
than
one
but
i
think
i
could
do
several
of
these
and
be
in
heaven
so
i
will
try
to
get
more
but
alas
they
are
rare
and
in
demand
rightfully
so
perfect
end
to
the
day
o
love
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
when
first
tried
with
its
relative
easy
availability
at
least
here
in
illinois
close
to
the
indiana
border
and
excellent
balance
of
hoppyfruity
flavor
this
will
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
for
all
occasions
not
innovative
but
does
everything
right
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
really
well
drinkable
and
a
great
accompaniment
to
lots
of
food
mouthfeel
is
attractive
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
classic
ipa
overall
i
could
see
why
this
brewery
is
quite
good
for
an
extreme
pale
ale
it
flourishes
and
i
would
consider
picking
up
more
offerings
especially
if
they
started
using
the
12oz
format
more
often
very
solid
ipa
smooth
mouthfeel
and
hoppy
taste
with
a
subtle
background
maltiness
pleasant
hoppy
aroma
gives
an
even
strong
taste
of
hops
while
not
being
overly
bitter
definitely
very
drinkable
as
a
daily
beer
think
this
would
supplant
furious
as
my
goto
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
o
overall
its
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
easy
drinking
tasty
and
easier
to
get
than
most
other
3
floyds
o
an
incredibly
balanced
and
smooth
pale
ale
i
was
shocked
my
how
impressive
and
strong
the
malt
character
was
on
this
beer
it
laid
a
great
foundation
for
all
the
hop
character
o
this
beer
has
a
very
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hopsyou
get
a
lot
of
the
citrusy
aromas
and
flavors
with
only
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
very
good
craft
beer
i
would
certainly
share
this
among
those
who
love
their
hoppy
bitter
beer
not
flashy
just
pretty
delicious
o
was
kinda
excited
to
try
my
first
3f
offering
but
alpha
king
is
a
boring
beer
just
not
fun
to
me
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
about
i
wont
be
back
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
better
beer
but
was
slightly
disappointed
slight
head
and
not
much
if
any
residual
lacing
the
aroma
was
nice
slight
citrus
but
not
much
else
flavor
was
nothing
special
a
generic
ipa
maybe
the
batch
was
old
seemed
to
taste
a
little
mediciney
at
the
finish
this
is
a
solid
beer
o
overall
this
is
good
smooth
and
delicious
the
hops
arent
over
powering
and
the
hops
blend
really
with
the
malt
not
the
best
pale
ale
but
very
good
oi
have
always
wanted
an
alpha
king
finally
got
the
goahead
on
this
one
i
found
it
to
be
an
above
average
ipapale
ale
hybrid
but
not
much
more
than
that
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
really
appreciated
trying
after
looking
for
it
during
my
travels
over
the
last
couple
of
years
definitely
one
i
wish
i
had
easier
access
to
and
that
i
could
enjoy
more
readily
highly
recommend
and
definitely
in
my
top
100
of
all
time
o
really
nice
good
hop
presence
and
balanced
by
malts
but
if
ive
gone
out
of
my
way
enough
to
find
it
there
will
probably
be
its
better
version
zombie
dust
available
too
very
smooth
very
decent
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
my
first
three
floyds
thank
you
to
mike
for
the
opportunity
overall
a
very
good
beer
no
date
on
the
bottle
which
sucks
but
very
very
good
o
good
but
not
extraordinary
maybe
i
just
dont
like
pale
ales
that
much
but
being
a
3floyds
brew
i
had
to
try
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
but
not
up
there
with
the
top
beers
ive
had
crisp
and
enjoyable
though
o
it
looked
and
at
first
smelled
so
good
the
taste
was
a
bit
odd
but
ok
perhaps
an
old
bottle
no
date
info
anywhere
i
could
find
and
dating
beer
does
not
list
any
info
on
how
to
find
it
if
it
is
there
somewhere
none
of
the
fruitiness
a
pale
ale
ought
to
at
least
hint
at
smashing
pale
ale
i
think
the
best
ive
tried
thanks
to
beerjesus
for
this
throw
in
rating
4

zombie
heads
i
havent
been
disappointed
by
a
three
floyds
brew
yet
great
flagship
brew
i
love
the
citrus
hops
that
fffs
uses
the
hops
are
similar
to
that
of
zombie
dust
and
gumballhead
but
this
one
has
more
notes
of
pine
this
one
doesnt
have
quite
as
crisp
of
a
finish
as
those
two
still
an
awesome
beer
and
will
drink
it
anywhere
its
available
o
this
is
my
second
beer
form
three
floyds
and
again
i
am
extremely
impressed
zombie
dust
was
the
first
and
this
one
isnt
far
behind
alpha
king
in
a
very
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
and
one
i
highly
recommend
unfortunately
i
only
have
the
one
o
great
beer
overall
have
yet
to
hate
a
beer
from
three
floyds
another
must
try
beer
pours
a
robust
copper
color
with
about
a
fingers
breadth
of
offwhite
almost
ivory
colored
head
comprised
of
mediumsized
bubbles
respectable
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
and
earthen
hop
cones
a
bit
of
pine
sap
some
wet
earth
and
orange
citrus
it
tastes
similar
but
with
a
greater
emphasis
on
the
orange
citrus
a
bit
of
lemon
rind
and
grapefruit
come
through
as
well
earthen
notes
including
grass
and
pine
are
more
predominant
than
the
spicy
character
that
was
notable
on
the
nose
hint
of
caramel
malt
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
but
rich
in
carbonation
with
a
nearly
effervescent
quality
finish
is
wet
and
refreshing
but
doesnt
linger
longer
than
wanted
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
while
commendable
it
lacks
a
certain
depth
that
some
other
toptier
examples
may
provide
seeming
somewhat
onedimensional
still
this
only
adds
to
the
drinkability
as
it
prevents
it
from
becoming
too
filling
or
overwhelming
in
that
regard
great
success
here
overall
by
far
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
4
5
o
somewhat
rough
and
abrupt
in
the
hops
department
at
times
but
the
body
and
mouthfeel
go
a
long
way
to
promote
drinkability
in
the
end
its
a
crushable
pale
capable
of
delivering
quite
a
hop
fix
and
it
really
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
o
i
find
this
beer
a
pleasure
but
not
always
an
easy
one
though
other
three
floyds
might
represent
a
finer
example
of
what
beer
can
be
this
is
a
pretty
clear
statement
of
what
a
three
floyds
beer
is
strong
almost
brutish
an
explosion
of
flavor
i
enjoy
the
contrasts
and
think
the
beer
represents
a
very
successful
statement
of
how
big
and
robust
a
beer
can
be
below
7
abv
this
is
another
quality
pale
ale
from
fffs
lots
of
flavor
yet
enough
balance
to
allow
you
to
drink
a
few
of
them
o
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorites
big
flavors
on
both
sides
of
the
spectrum
but
they
manage
to
find
a
perfect
balance
o
perfect
apa
id
be
happy
if
more
breweries
cloned
alpha
king
has
an
exquisite
combination
of
maltspinehops
and
citrus
for
a
wonderful
apa
highly
recommended
its
no
wonder
that
many
beeradvocaters
if
thats
a
word
admire
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
appearancetypical
pale
ale
color
but
with
very
nice
lacing
and
head
retention
its
got
the
hop
presence
of
an
ipa
but
is
labeled
as
an
apa
the
smell
is
not
outstanding
at
all
and
while
the
hop
profile
really
is
quite
nice
the
onedimensional
malt
character
oversweet
caramel
contributes
an
odd
and
unappreciated
balance
to
all
of
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
the
strong
suit
heredespite
all
of
the
supersweet
caramel
flavors
its
not
sticky
and
the
thickness
and
carbonation
are
near
spoton
while
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
i
cant
say
it
quite
lives
up
to
its
hype

is
sweet

and
bitter
peach
tropical
fruit
and
fresh

flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
the
hops
seem
to
be
an
afterthought
upon
the
first
sip
merely
there
to
balance
the
classic
carmel
malt
flavor
but
man
do
they
slowly
creep
up
to
dominate
the
palate
with
earthy
bitterness
and
stone
fruit
that
lingers
well
after
the
malt
gives
way
in
the
overall

can

would
be

sick
to
leave
this
behind
nothing
pretentious
or
screaming
out
look
at
me
fantastic
american
pale
ale
and
one
from
fff
to
pull
the
trigger
on
overall
excellent

with
everything
that
should
be
there
citrusy
slightly

plenty

quaff
o
i
live
within
a
few
hours
of
3
floyds
and
sadly
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
of
theirs
that
i
have
tried
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
zombie
dust
and
i
plan
to
make
a
trip
to
the
brewery
i
think
the
hype
about
3
floyds
is
legit
prost
arguably
the
best
pale
ale
in
the
world
at
least
of
the
american
variety
of
pales
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
zombie
dust
and
with
that
so
hard
to
get
even
with
me
living
in
indiana
this
will
be
my
new
go
to
beer
overall
holy
shit
im
impressed
this
might
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
o
one
of
the
best
pale

ive
ever
had
very
well

fantastic
of
all
the
three
floyds
pales
this
really
stands
out
balanced
restrained
yet
full
and
satisfying
its
a
little
dark
for
a
pale
but
thats
where
any
criticism
ends

overall
for
a
pale

this
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
o
an
outstanding
pale
ale
wish
more
beers
tasted
like
this
o
this
my
first
three
floyds
offering
and
felt
i
should
go
with
this
one
as
it
is
their
flagship
beer
amazing
balance
of
not
being
too
hoppy
for
a
lighter
bodied
apa
overall
beautiful
hop
flavor
aroma
and
taste
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
its
both
big
and
highly
drinkable
i
have
trouble
categorizing
it
as
an
apa
because
of
its
explosive
aroma
and
flavors
its
extreme
hoppiness
ten
years
ago
this
was
moderately
priced
beer
but
as
three
floyds
has
grown
in
renown
the
price
has
gone
up
and
it
can
be
hard
to
find
even
here
is
chicago
at
old
prices
it
was
my
everyday
beer
now
its
a
treat
ah
the
old
days
o
overall
it
did
not
quite
meet
the
hype
but
the
hype
was
very
difficult
to
meet
still
a
fantastic
ipa
doesnt
hold
a
torch
to
zd
imo
but
not
much
does
definitely
more
citrus
focused
than
zd
killer
apa
no
doubt
my
first
ever
three
floyds
on
tap
its
not
something
you
forget
overall
this
is
one
loaded
pale
ale
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
full
of
wonderful
hop
notes
and
a
distinct
malt
profile
very
bitter
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
unpleasant
certainly
one
of
the
better
pales
out
there
highly
recommended
poured
from
tap
into
nonic
pint
at
the
brewery
deep
caramel
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
piney
hop
and
sweet
caramel
aroma
taste
is
bitter
hops
with
some
sweet
caramel
finish
for
me
the
bitterness
is
just
too
much
its
actually
way
too
bitter
for
my
likes
which
is
the
norm
for
fff
huge
malt
and
bitter
profile
and
lots
of
people
like
that
just
not
me
good
brew
for
sure
i
just
dont
get
the
hype
on
this
one
m
medium
bodied
o
outstanding
this
one
lives
up
to
its
hype
by
all
means
im
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
that
i
got
two
bottles
of
it
lives
up
to
expectations
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
hint
of
red
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
head
after
a
pretty
normal
pour
really
a
nice
looking
beer
getting
hints
of
bread
biscuit
a
bit
of
carmel
and
some
piney
hops
off
this
one
kind
of
underwhelmed
on
the
aroma
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
though
tons
of
hop
presence
from
the
first
sip
nice
resiney
pine
base
with
citrus
fruit
overtones
also
getting
some
peach
through
on
this
one
the
malt
comes
through
less
in
the
flavor
than
on
the
nose
but
the
same
flavors
are
there
good
caarbonation
medium
mouthfeel
overall
great
beer
i
enjoyed
the
hop
presence
in
this
apa
and
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
it
isnt
exactly
to
style
but
what
fff
brew
is
overall
good
beer
big
bitterness
for
a
pale
good
display
of
hops
its
loaded
up
it
gets
rather
one
dimensional
as
it
warms
behind
the
bitterness
i
thought
at
least
would
have
it
again
for
sure
though
its
a
simple
and
elegant
pale
ale
with
loads
of
hops
in
the
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
bittering
its
a
very
well
balanced
brew
with
the
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
the
beer
did
not
blow
my
socks
off
but
is
quite
good
o
this
is
a
perfect
beer
there
is
really
nothing
to
improve
other
then
to
use
different
styles
of
hops
to
give
a
different
pallet
i
wish
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
in
ohio
because
it
would
be
my
go
to
bee
ive
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
this
beer
and
it
did
not
disappoint
fresh
bright
aroma
zesty
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
spicy
bitterness
on
the
back
end
malt
bill
was
perfect
for
the
amount
of
hops
used
well
crafted
and
highly
enjoyed
o
excellent
i
had
my
first
alpha
king
immediately
after
an
excellent
odd
side
ales
cpa
and
suspected
it
might
pale
excuse
me
by
comparison
well
its
different
but
similar
in
both
sensory
properties
and
quality
glad
i
have
5
more
reviewed

this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
blurs
the
lines
between
and
apa
and
an
ipa
but
i
have
no
problem
calling
this
is
an
apa
well
done
from
the
bottle
into
a
funky
buddha
snifter
i
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
its
super
hoppy
but
with
a
bit
of
balance
to
it
its
very
dark
for
a
pale
nice
23
finger
head
great
retention
and
lacing
very
citrusy
taste
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
smell
a
very
good
pale
not
in
my
top
10
but
still
very
good
thanks

an

but
pretty
close
the
carbonation
is

overall
this
might
be
the
finest
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
out
there
great
work
3floyds
o
a
great
ale
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
drink
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
have
finally
reviewed
it
o
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
ipas
from
my
area
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
i
like
it
more
every
time
i
try
another
ipa
from
the
next
up
and
coming
brewery
3f
knows
apas
and
there
is
a
reason
this
is
almost
always
in
my
fridge
o
a
nice
balanced
apa
at
times
it
is
close
to
a
hoppy
amber
and
borders
on
being
a
balanced
ipa
i
am
not
a
huge
hophead
in
fact
i
dont
like
most
ipas
this
is
an
apa
but
i
do
like
this
one
the
smell
of
hops
is
a
bit
thick
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
to
hoppy
for
me
but
thats
the
style
it
absolutely
represents
the
style
well
there
are
times
when
im
in
a
hoppy
mood
i
usually
turn
to
an
imperial
stout
but
those
are
quite
heavy
this
is
a
little
lighter
a
bit
more
drinkable
i
could
have
another
very
drinkable
very
good
beer
alpha
king
is
the
flag
ship
beer
for
three
floyds
as
a
result
it
needs
to
be
a
solid
tasting
beer
and
it
is
it
is
a
bit
cloudy
but
it
has
a
very
hoppy
taste
that
is
common
in
many
of
the
three
floyds
beers
if
i
was
at
a
party
and
that
was
among
a
variety
of
other
beers
i
would
grab
it
first
followed
by
a
zombie
dust
the
only
problems
with
the
beer
are
the
price
around
12
a
six
pack
and
availability
nice
apa
would
buy
more
if
it
was
dated
o
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
hoppy
beer
the
bitterness
is
smooth
and
round
with
lots
of
aroma
but
there
is
still
a
malt
flavor
that
make
it
interesting
an
old
favorite
overall
a
wellbalanced
pale
with
a
great
flavor
profile
and
fine
drinkability
this
one
did
not
disappoint
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
west
coast
hoppy
pales
imo
o
this
serves
as
my
standard
for
a
pale
ale
there
are
a
few
better
but
manymany
that
are
worse
of
course
it
is
better
fresh
but
can
hold
up
over
time
i
love
the
complex
balance
of
hops
citrusy
and
resiny
i
would
keep
this
in
the
fridge
247
if
always
available
i
see
a
6er
here
and
there
a
few
times
a
year
o
i
was
not
disappointed
with
this
one
the
lightish
body
and
delicate
carbonation
makes
this
one
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
very
good
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
style
good
mix
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
a
nice
biscuity
caramel
malt
presence
overall
the
hoppiest
apa
ive
had
and
makes
it
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
a
great
beer
none
the
less
i
love
the
citrus
hops
and
the
nice
sweetness
the
malt
perfect
if
you
dont
like
overly
bitter
ipas
but
would
like
a
more
citrushoppy
pale
ale
being
from
indiana
im
a
little
biased
but
seems
like
it
should
be
the
best
apa
in
the
country
i
could
drink
these
for
ever
overall
i
think
this
should
be
classified
as
an
ipa
i
dont
normally
like
ipas
but
this
was
good
o
wow
so
complete
and
balabced
flavorful
and
drinkable
spot
on
abv
and
ibus
the
one
thing
that
i
dont
like
the
buttugly
label
petty
i
know
crisp
and
refreshing
creamy
head
very
pleasant
longlasting
finish
neither
the
hop
character
or
the
body
overpower
one
another
it
is
also
quite
thirstquenching
this
is
a
rare
apa
that
would
be
appropriate
for
a
winter
or
summer
session
one
of
the
finest
offerings
from
three
floyds
thought
this
beer
was
good
but
a
little
on
the
meh
side
as
far
as
my
expectations
go
had
high
hopes
as
ive
absolutely
loved
everything
ive
tried
from
three
floyds
so
far
especially
since
this
is
their
flagship
beer
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
was
definitely
a
good
pale
ale
however
onedimentional
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
verdict
a
pretty
standard
apa
from
three
floyds
and
its
no
wonder
why
theyve
been
making
this
for
over
16
years
its
crisp
its
refreshing
its
hoppy
without
being
abrasive
and
most
of
all
its
clean
and
balanced
o
really
disappointing
o
hoppier
than
most
apas
but
quite
enjoyable
a
standard
for
the
style
if
there
were
no
lable
i
would
have
assumed
this
one
were
an
ipa
this
is
probably
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
nice
creamy
amber
with
a
very
intense
hop
character
the
best
i
can
find
for
this
style
if
you
can
find
it
i
highly
recommend
it
since
its
in
my
home
state
we
have
pride
in
our
indiana
brewer
and
brewpub
a
flavorful
apa
that
does
not
end
the
night
the
taste
is
more
of
an
ipa
then
pale
ale
very
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
around
needs
to
come
to
ohio
more
o
cleans
out
the
palate
while
remaining
easy
to
put
back
i
would
have
this
any
time
and
im
really
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
on
tap
its
strange
how
good
three
floyds
is
with
apa
and
yet
their
dipas
are
at
best
average
o
impressed
by
this
beer
especially
for
the
price
it
is
nicely
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
will
make
you
happy
very
good
this
is
a
great
apa
but
like
most
three
floyds
pale
ales
this
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
it
has
a
great
amount
of
hops
but
the
amount
of
malt
makes
this
easy
to
drink
and
really
balances
it
out
a
tad
overhyped
but
great
worth
trying
what
perhaps
may
be
the
most
normal
of
easy
to
find
fff
offerings
its
still
quite
different
from
pale
ales
that
im
used
to
this
isnt
your
cascadefocused
pale
ale
here
the
maltiness
is
very
hearty
and
combined
with
the
very
pleasant
range
of
hops
its
far
more
juicy
and
zesty
as
a
result
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
balanced
nature
could
make
this
the
goto
pale
ale
in
my
fridge
yearround
if
i
could
only
get
this
out
west
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
least
o
ill
keep
it
in
my
back
pocket
but
if
you
have
never
had
it
then
pick
up
a
6
pack
and
give
it
a
go
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
could
throw
back
a
few
with
ease
if
the
time
were
right
sadly
i
notice
i
am
in
ga
and
this
is
outside
of
their
distribution
my
first
3f
beer
and
it
was
excellent
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
from
day
one
alpha
king
was
a
classic
and
deserving
halloffamer
its
by
far
the
2nd
best
american
pale
ale
ever
produced
imo
and
im
sure
everyone
knows
who
make
the
1
apa
yep
fff
hold
both
of
those
1
and
2
spots
in
my
book
simply
remarkable
what
they
do
with
alpha
king
and
zombie
dust
both
are
clear
cut
winners
and
both
a
must
try
if
you
have
access
to
this
then
you
should
be
enjoying
it
its
top
shelf
good
i
just
wish
wed
get
the
bottles
of
this
on
a
regular
basis
here
at
home
ill
buy
this
anytime
i
see
it
a
well
balanced
world
class
apa
thats
ridiculously
tasty
and
fulfilling
indeed
fff
brewing
a
liquid
like
alpha
king
pure
class
pure
genius
o
excellent
apa
if
i
could
get
this
around
here
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
and
as
a
side
note
three
floyds
bottle
artwork
really
jumps
out
at
you
truly
a
great
beer
o
honestly
too
much
caramel
malt
and
too
big
of
a
beer
for
the
claimed
style
its
a
somewhat
above
average
ipa
i
think
but
fff
misses
the
target
here
b
ive
always
liked
the
label
art
no
freshness
date
but
my
store
just
got
it
in
so
ill
assume
its
fresh
i
love
the
look
of
this
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
darker
then
your
average
pale
ale
or
ipa
amber
with
some
caramel
color
hazy
nice
head
and
lacing
dont
get
me
wrong
it
has
plenty
of
hops
up
front
but
this
thing
is
well
balanced
and
the
very
last
taste
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
is
toasty
malts
this
is
damn
good
beer
i
love
how
the
citrus
hop
flavor
up
front
is
balanced
and
nearly
taken
over
by
malt
hate
to
use
the
malt
backbone
cliché
but
its
really
appropriate
here
it
takes
a
hell
of
a
malt
backbone
to
even
out
these
hops
times
change
fast
this
used
to
be
seen
as
a
real
hop
bomb
of
a
pale
aleipa
but
now
that
job
is
left
up
to
its
brother
zombie
dust
meanwhile
this
one
is
becoming
a
classic
o
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
is
nicely
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
keeps
my
interest
through
out
the
glass
very
nice
too
bad
i
had
only
one
i
think
i
will
have
to
pursue
more
of
this
o
a
very
nice
pale
ale
refreshing
also
tasty
and
well
balanced
a
great
apa
a
lot
more
flavor
here
than
most
offerings
in
the
style
which
is
typical
for
3f
have
had
this
before
but
just
had
it
again
and
it
is
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
if
you
are
an
apa
person
or
an
ipa
person
i
still
think
youll
love
this
beer
floral
hops
and
balanced
sweetness
great
finish
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
it
dont
pass
it
up
upon
drinking
first
comes
a
very
hoppy
front
more
in
the
standard
of
an
american
ipa
with
a
good
finish
i
keep
forgetting
this
is
suppose
to
be
a
pale
ale
but
it
sure
doesnt
feel
like
one
this
is
quite
an
okay
drink
but
nothing
here
i
would
desperately
want
to
have
for
an
apa
o
glad
to
have
finally
been
able
to
try
a
three
floyds
brew
not
to
mention
their
flagship
beer
this
one
definitely
delivers
full
flavor
for
a
pale
ale
and
almost
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
with
its
characteristics
even
though
this
seems
to
be
a
huge
pale
ale
it
delivers
and
definitely
does
not
disappoint
keep
it
up
fff
oh
i
wish
i
had
another
one
real
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
more
of
an
ipa
to
me
very
red
in
color
not
quite
amber
but
definitely
moving
in
that
direction
with
a
big
rich
tan
head
that
doesnt
fade
at
all
bold
hop
aromas
are
just
blasting
out
of
this
with
equal
parts
forest
and
fruit
grove
definitely
some
higher
alpha
acid
varieties
this
beer
seems
by
the
smell
to
be
very
appropriately
named
the
flavor
actually
does
find
some
malt
balance
despite
the
intense
hopping
there
is
a
sweeter
yet
dry
american
caramel
malt
going
on
which
holds
up
the
hops
quite
well
plenty
of
citrus
bitterness
in
the
finish
too
not
lemony
but
equally
pungent
there
is
also
a
sort
of
woody
character
to
this
that
i
sometimes
find
in
hoppy
beers
not
like
its
been
oaked
but
like
its
made
in
part
from
freshly
milled
timber
in
any
event
the
finish
is
about
an
7
on
a
10
point
bitter
scale
strong
but
not
overbearing
nice
mouthfeel
too
maybe
a
little
dense
for
the
style
but
this
is
a
style
thats
constantly
in
flux
anyways
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
decent
abv
make
this
about
the
perfect
6pack
beer
in
my
mind
one
of
my
first
few
beers
from
the
much
hyped
three
floyds
and
it
did
not
disappoint
although
i
can
think
of
several
american
pales
that
are
every
bit
as
good
as
the
alpha
king
here
still
fantastic
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
has
a
strong
citrus
smell
followed
by
a
fresh
hoppy
scent
it
rolls
down
the
palette
intoxicating
and
bursting
with
flavor
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
a
glass
from
a
cask
at
three
floyds
brew
pub
and
the
flavors
are
more
present
than
on
the
tap
or
in
the
bottle
dont
expect
to
like
any
lite
beer
after
this
gem
d
very
wish
i
had
more
right
now
o
this
is
a
little
too
sour
for
my
taste
but
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
ipas
than
i
am
of
pale
ales
its
a
good
hoppy
ale
im
still
new
to
the
world
of
ipas
or
big
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
is
actually
enjoyable
to
drink
unlike
some
o
nice
paleipa
closer
to
two
hearted
than
sierra
pale
nice
caramel
and
citrus
with
good
amount
of
pine
bitterness
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
fairly
dense
bubbly
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
smell
s
orange
pine
bready
lemon
taste
starts
with
sweet
malt
that
makes
way
for
citrus
fruits
and
tropical
fruits
some
caramel
earthy
sweet
hop
profile
nice
grainy
backbone
overall
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
amazing
balance
of
malt
and
hops
a
beer
anyone
can
love
but
still
has
a
distinct
profile
d
absurdly
drinkable
id
definitely
get
it
again
if
i
was
so
lucky
my
second
beer
from
three
floyds
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
very
good
beer
picked
up
one
of
these
at
the
new
whole
foods
in
kildeer
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
a
very
appealing
dark
golden
color
bordering
on
a
red
a
nice
thin
head
carrying
through
a
different
oily
texture
in
the
mouth
smooth
and
bold
hop
flavor
to
start
and
finishes
smooth
very
solid
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
overall
a
pretty
tasty
hopstrong
pale
ale
not
quite
an
amazing
beer
id
like
a
bit
more
citrus
but
another
solid
from
a
brewery
that
should
expand
to
michigan
now
that
they
have
added
ohio
great
stuff
had
on
cask
yesterday
at
the
fff
brewpub
10
oz
pour
into
a
nonic
pint
amber
colored
with
a
beautiful
whitish
head
that
laced
the
whole
way
down
smooth
mouthfeel
almost
undercarbed
hops
are
almost
understated
yet
balanced
making
alpha
king
an
easy
drinker
compared
to
zombie
dust
one
of
my
favorite
regular
bottlings
from
fff
a
treat
to
have
on
cask
overall
allaround
great
pale
ale
if
you
can
call
it
that
and
a
very
fitting
flagship
beer
for
3
floyds
even
better
when
you
consider
the
35
price
tag
on
a
case
directly
from
the
brewery
overall
i
give
this
one
a
3
55
it
not
bad
but
it
is
a
weird
brew
and
i
felt
that
it
needed
more
definition
a
nice
tasty
concoction
of
malt
and
hops
heavy
on
both
and
not
holding
back
from
much
doesnt
taste
much
like
an
apa
rather
i
think
this
one
is
more
deserving
of
a
malty
ipa
title
either
way
its
pretty
drinkable
and
goes
down
easily
maybe
a
tad
overrated
in
my
opinion
but
good
nonetheless
tastefeel
just
an
awesome
beer
the
most
dominant
flavor
that
i
get
is
of
a
quality
caramel
malt
on
the
start
the
finish
is
super
clean
and
offers
a
burst
of
fresh
hops
not
only
is
this
beer
pretty
much
perfectly
balanced
it
has
an
outstanding
flavor
theres
virtually
no
aftertaste
which
makes
me
want
to
keep
going
back
for
another
sip
alpha
kings
a
worthy
flagship
beer
at
three
floyds
and
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
overall
i
can
only
hope
that
they
ship
this
stuff
to
michigan
some
day
soon
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
kind
of
a
three
floyds
forgotten
gem
here
the
flagship
beer
that
we
dont
have
too
often
we
forget
how
good
it
actually
is
the
hops
are
balanced
absolutely
perfect
with
a
slight
citrus
aftertaste
the
6
66
abv
is
also
a
nice
touch
from
the
boys
and
girl
over
at
three
floyds
just
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
just
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
ipas
so
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
something
i
normally
drink
but
the
intense
hop
aroma
and
great
balance
make
this
a
winner
overall
good
balance
in
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
floral
notes
started
to
appeared
in
both
aroma
and
taste
very
nice
malt
characters
it
was
little
odd
at
first
overall
alpha
king
is
a
tasty
brew
raul
was
tripping
more
than
a
year
later
raul
dipped
in
again
and
he
is
well
into
this
thang
bottom
line
great
beer
period
this
one
wins
just
by
a
little
in
comparison
to
zombie
dust
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
at
first
slightly
fizzy
then
softly
foamy
as
it
moves
across
the
palate
closes
quite
dry
with
modest
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
the
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
color
the
smell
is
fruity
with
hops
the
usual
fff
hoppy
smell
it
has
a
fruity
taste
at
first
then
followed
by
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
bitterness
then
dissipates
and
you
want
more
slight
carmel
overall
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
notes
4411
pours
a
lustrous
orange
with
a
shiny
white
cap
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
hops
with
bright
orangetangerine
and
freshly
cut
grass
notes
taking
the
forefront
however
theres
a
nicely
doughy
caramel
malt
backbone
holding
up
that
hoppiness
this
beer
definitely
straddles
the
line
between
apa
and
ipa
the
taste
is
also
much
bigger
than
your
average
apa
it
has
marvelous
balance
starting
with
malt
sweetness
and
smoothly
transitioning
to
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
very
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
has
a
round
full
feel
that
never
gets
too
heavy
flavor
fills
your
mouth
with
each
sip
but
it
finishes
clean
light
and
in
need
of
another
quaff
o
finally
reviewed
after
drinking
on
tap
previously
and
in
bottle
several
times
on
cask
seemed
to
really
accentuate
the
carbonation
it
was
really
smooth
this
beer
is
always
available
but
when
i
saw
it
on
cask
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
well
worth
it
and
as
three
floyds
everyday
beer
its
always
a
good
solid
option
all
in
all
hop
forward
not
overly
sensational
from
an
olfactory
perspective
biting
hops
taste
with
a
malty
finish
and
great
mouthfeel
i
was
debating
with
how
it
compares
to
others
i
like
on
par
with
sculpin
but
different
not
as
sessionable
as
dogfish
60
or
lagunitas
but
an
excellent
ipa
three
floyds
alpha
king
3
55
this
ale
is
considered
a
flagship
for
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
nation
and
it
seems
to
hold
true
for
a
nonimperial
style
this
pours
a
golden
amber
theres
an
orange
marmalade
aroma
and
a
bready
toasted
biscuit
note
which
contrasts
with
the
hop
aroma
i
find
a
similar
orange
marmalade
flavor
thats
dryly
bitter
with
pine
and
orange
peel
on
it
nicely
carbonated
with
a
bitterness
that
lasts
pours
deep
clear
amber
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
huge
floral
grapefruit
first
taste
is
pine
hops
with
a
tinge
of
grapefruit
even
more
malt
than
expected
beautiful
fruit
flavor
without
much
bitter
citrus
and
caramel
malts
grapefruits
but
not
bitter
yum
medium
slick
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
easy
drinking
solid
beer
but
will
have
to
check
out
zombie
dust
now
this
thing
is
awesome
a
total
must
have
a
perfectly
balanced
pale
ale
yummy
caramel
malts
delicious
citrus
hops
fluffs
up
so
nicely
on
the
palate
cant
believe
im
here
at
the
brew
pub
one
ff
the
tap
is
all
i
need
this
would
go
so
well
with
a
round
of
disc
golf
having
a
bit
of
a
beergasm
a
right
fine
pale
ale
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
with
a
good
bit
of
bitter
hoppyness
balanced
by
sweet
malts
while
i
wont
yearn
for
more
i
wont
turn
any
away
either
o
this
is
an
extremely
wellbalanced
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
hop
sweetbitterness
and
the
perfect
malt
combination
great
mouthfeel
extremely
welldone
o
excellent
apa
that
i
could
drink
everyday
if
this
is
something
that
you
have
never
had
it
is
a
must
try
it
is
the
standard
for
the
style
this
pours
a
semicloudy
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
scents
of
hops
with
hints
of
grains
and
citrus
the
taste
starts
off
as
a
bold
rich
pale
ale
and
than
finishes
with
an
extra
amount
of
crisp
bitterness
this
is
about
as
perfect
of
a
pale
ale
as
ive
ever
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
poured
this
brew
and
received
a
warm
amber
colored
body
with
about
a
12
fingers
worth
of
an
off
white
head
that
left
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
earthy
telltale
of
warrior
hops
mixed
with
hints
of
citrus
the
flavor
punched
your
palate
immediately
with
a
solid
blast
of
bitterness
followed
by
some
earthy
hop
flavors
and
toasted
malt
the
body
was
light
to
medium
and
left
your
mouth
dry
afterwards
overall
across
the
board
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
i
live
in
an
area
where
some
effort
is
need
to
obtain
this
brew
but
worth
it
every
time
it
is
unfair
to
compare
other
apa
against
this
beer
since
it
is
simply
so
much
different
then
other
of
its
style
o
ive
waited
years
to
try
this
beer
it
met
and
exceeded
my
expectations
hands
down
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
had
i
loved
everything
about
it
including
the
awesome
artwork
on
the
bottles
and
6pk
carrier
this
would
easily
be
my
go
to
apa
if
i
was
in
the
region
i
purchased
these
in
o
perfect
balance
great
mouthfeel
hard
to
find
any
faults
with
this
beer
i
suggest
everyone
try
it
very
smooth
hoppy
but
less
hoppy
then
zombie
dust
tatse
way
better
then
pride
and
joy
a
mild
pale
ale
but
not
to
mild
malty
and
bitter
describes
this
pale
ale
also
a
light
hint
of
citrus
hops
but
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
have
this
once
in
a
while
but
gumball
and
zombie
are
still
there
best
beers
on
the
market
oa
tasty
pale
ale
with
a
nice
malt
presence
and
good
hop
balance
easy
drinking
overall
better
than
your
typical
pale
ale
it
just
has
that
extra
magic
in
the
hops
sessionable
and
tasty
alpha
king
pours
a
deep
redamber
color
with
nice
creamy
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
pungent
hops
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
its
got
a
nice
medium
body
with
just
enough
malt
to
keep
the
hops
in
check
but
the
hops
really
do
want
kick
your
ass
its
got
nice
zippy
bit
bite
on
the
back
end
alpha
king
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
and
a
for
sure
go
to
big
thanks
to
brew33
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
out
one
love
o
obviously
not
as
impressive
of
a
hop
profile
as
zombie
dust
but
its
still
very
satisfying
definitely
wins
points
for
balance
and
overall
smoothness
o
a
really
good
pale
ale
if
this
was
around
my
area
of
living
it
would
be
a
staple
alongside
snpa
overall
its
nothing
phenomenal
or
revolutionary
but
its
a
damn
good
drinking
beer
o
this
is
such
an
amazing
pale
ale
and
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
3f
sure
loves
using
their
hops
in
pale
ales
but
i
personally
think
that
is
whats
amazing
about
this
beer
this
beer
though
isnt
near
as
good
as
zombie
dust
overall
an
excellent
stuff
from
3floyds
my
second
beer
from
them
first
one
was
at
the
pub
on
tap
the
name
of
which
i
do
not
seem
to
remember
it
was
an
ipa
as
well
highly
recommended
maybe
my
bottle
wasnt
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
and
like
many
three
flours
beers
id
love
to
revisit
them
down
the
line
but
this
one
hit
me
with
a
tantalizing
blast
of
hoppy
aromas
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
of
the
bottle
and
unfortunately
went
down
hill
from
there
i
found
it
overly
sweet
more
assertively
bitter
than
flavorfully
hopped
and
drinking
bigger
than
it
should
lacks
subtlety
of
any
kind
and
has
more
alcohol
presence
than
id
like
both
characteristics
ive
encountered
before
with
this
brewery
s
beers
not
bad
but
i
clearly
am
in
the
minority
here
in
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
this
this
is
the
beer
that
got
it
all
started
for
me
i
love
this
beer
from
the
grapefruit
hoppy
taste
to
the
citrus
smell
this
beer
is
my
kryptonite
i
cant
go
into
the
brew
pub
or
local
shop
and
not
walk
out
with
a
six
pack
of
this
seek
it
out
this
beer
is
a
gem
o
i
stopped
at
a
small
bottle
shop
in
porter
in
and
picked
up
3
varieties
of
fff
and
not
a
single
one
has
disappointed
so
far
this
is
no
exception
a
must
try
final
thoughts
i
like
this
one
as
an
ipa
good
hop
character
and
a
balanced
malt
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
got
to
finish
the
sixpack
at
least
overalls
love
it
an
epic
example
of
the
style
savor
every
sip
if
not
readily
available
in
your
area
3
floyds
has
my
absolute
favorite
labelsmarketing
as
well
o
a
hoppy
interpretation
of
a
pale
ale
which
is
fine
by
me
but
zd
is
better
overall
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
so
good
pours

never

alpha

is
definitely
good
very
hoppy

strong

ak
is
best
at

for

wash
it

although
i
would
think
this
is
more
an
ipa
myself
the
citrus
and
caramel
malt
are
balanced
very
well
which
makes
this
a
beer
you
can
have
quite
a
few
of
without
destroying
your
taste

my
favorite
six

from

just
a

yep
yep
the
good
ol
days
when
doozies
like
this
were
legitimately
distributed
to
pa
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
pleasantly
hoppy
aroma
with
lots
of
citrus
and
pale
malts
delightfully
light
on
the
palate
with
a
great
balance
of
light
sweet
malts
and
crisp
citrus
hops
finishes
crisp
and
just
dry
enough
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
seems
like
more
of
an
ipa
than
and
apa
but
tasty
nonetheless
one
of
my
goto
brews
for
a
hop
fix
the
mouthfeel
does
fall
a
little
short
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
put
this
over
the
top
for
me
even
with
a
slightly
dull
feel
to
it
alpha
king
is
an
easytodrink
beer
with
a
touch
of
complexity
and
it
does
a
nice
job
straddling
the
apaipa
border
i
have
6
other
3f
beers
to
try
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks
in
the
fridge
gonna
do
1
a
day
to
really
enjoy
them
im
guessing
this
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
for
me
and
this
brewery
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
as
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppier
beer
and
this
definitely
fit
the
bill
especially
for
style
i
was
also
impressed
with
how
thick
this
beer
was
for
the
style
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
pale
ale
can
be
if
i
could
get
this
regular
i
would
be
a
very
happy
man
but
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
out
o
fffs
alpha
king
is
one
hell
of
a
nice
apa
i
had
no
idea
it
was
packing
6
5
abv
as
the
alcohol
isnt
detectable
i
could
easily
put
a
sixer
of
this
back
in
a
sitting
highly
recommended
the
balance
of
flavors
is
spoton
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
flavors
are
not
very
complex
but
are
well
balanced
will
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
again
o
like
i
said
this
is
my
goto
beer
so
this
is
the
one
im
all
about
i
love
just
about
everything
about
this
one
is
this
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
yes
yes
i
think
it
just
may
well
be
damned
tasty
aromatic
and
beautiful
to
look
at
and
its
going
down
oh
so
fast
will
do
my
best
to
savor
the
rest
of
the
6pack
since
it
may
be
some
time
before
i
can
try
this
again
this
is
an
apa
i
could
enjoy
every
day
for
a
couple
of
years
or
so
if
i
could
get
it
every
day
it
might
replace
sierra
nevada
as
my
every
day
beer
or
every
other
day
beer
a
rubyamber
color
with
good
ivory
lace
this
beer
looks
good
smells
good
and
taste
like
citrus
and
fresh
hops
good
day
this
pours
cloudy
amber
and
has
nice
fluffy
head
and
good
lacing
there
are
a
lot
of
notable
hops
on
the
nose
surprising
for
a
pale
ale
the
amount
of
malt
is
also
outstanding
but
not
surprising
once
youve
seen
the
dark
color
this
pale
ale
is
delicious
and
crisp
there
isnt
quite
the
hop
presence
that
would
be
in
an
ipa
but
the
balance
of
strong
bitterness
and
heavy
malty
sweetness
packs
a
powerful
yet
sessionable
flavor
combo
the
body
is
fairly
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
but
again
easy
to
drink
o
id
say
this
is
the
quintessential
american
pale
ale
but
its
more
of
an
ipa
by
style
i
dont
care
what
it
is
its
good
in
a
sea
of
breweries
with
hype
surrounding
them
fff
is
truly
not
a
pretender
this
is
their
flagship
beer
and
boy
does
it
ever
represent
what
they
stand
for
big
hops
big
malt
big
beers
and
shattering
of
style
guidelines
fff
always
does
what
they
want
to
and
other
breweries
try
to
emulate
or
jealously
choose
to
ignore
what
theyre
doing
bow
down
this
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
sticky
off
white
head
that
hangs
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
piney
and
floral
and
it
sticks
in
your
nose
this
beer
smells
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
wonderful
pine
flavor
up
front
followed
by
some
nice
hop
bitterness
and
a
well
rounded
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
resinous
well
carbonated
feel
overall
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
m
mouthfeel
is
a
creaminess
and
then
the
bite
at
the
end
leaves
the
palate
dry
and
wanting
a
nother
drink
but
not
parched
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
low
in
alcohol
content
which
makes
this
a
dangerous
beer
to
fall
in
love
with
but
its
got
such
a
good
aftertaste
i
will
drink
until
i
cant
drink
no
more
plus
the
logo
is
sick
sick
and
creepy
this
is
a
great
beer
and
not
what
you
expect
from
a
beer
made
right
here
in
the
hoosier
state
funny
thing
is
their
dark
lord
is
oftentimes
voted
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
its
also
nearly
impossible
to
get
im
not
sure
if
the
hop
character
worked
for
me
its
a
great
beer
but
i
feel
like
some
hybrids
like
oscar
were
more
of
a
mix
as
opposed
to
being
for
hopheads
i
liked
it
but
i
feel
like
if
youre
looking
for
the
feel
of
an
apa
with
the
mouthfeel
of
ipa
its
not
for
you
fff
has
a
signature
hop
in
most
of
their
beers
which
is
great
just
something
about
this
beer
its
not
an
a
beer
to
me
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
i
wish
i
could
get
this
one
regularly
overall
its
a
good
beer
much
move
enjoyable
than
dreadnaught
o
great
pale
ale
could
not
find
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
and
i
suspect
its
just
a
little
past
its
prime
but
still
a
great
example
of
an
apa
would
like
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
slightly
different
apa
o
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
indeed
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
ooverall
this
is
a
great
apa
that
borderlines
an
ipa
im
not
sure
where
the
line
is
drawn
on
this
one
its
definitely
a
tasty
beer
that
would
be
a
go
to
of
mine
if
more
readily
available
in
my
area
the
tastes
are
strong
and
definitely
form
a
lasting
impression
on
your
palate
it
goes
down
way
too
quickly
o
for
a
style
i
usually
do
not
enjoy
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
in
this
style
a
great
summer
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
a
session
d
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
the
hop
aroma
minus
the
alcohol
and
bite
of
a
full
ipa
d
a
solid
sessionable
brew
extremely
drinkable
very
nice
for
style
which
seems
to
be
closer
to
an
ipa
as
numerous
people
have
already
said
enjoyed
this
prior
to
grilling
burgers
thanks
kris
o
drinks
very
easily
i
may
have
gotten
an
old
bottle
in
a
trade
seems
like
this
is
a
hit
for
certain
beer
drinkers
but
for
those
with
my
tastes
its
best
to
avoid
overall
its
just
a
wacky
piney
taste
that
somehow
seems
shouldnt
be
in
any
drink
o
as
scores
of
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
this
would
be
more
aptly
deemed
an
ipa
but
thats
not
all
too
bad
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
brew
has
earned
such
acclaim
it
is
quite
enjoyable
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
it
is
lacking
what
every
ipa
should
have
a
big
frothy
meringuelike
head
despite
this
error
alpha
king
remains
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
come
across
worthless
information
to
this
review
years
ago
when
this
was
easier
to
get
here
in
pa
i
used
to
buy
this
and
it
was
one
of
the
beers
that
turned
me
severely
steered
me
in
the
direction
of
hoppy
beers
i
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
and
wallet
for
this
beer
its
one
i
will
never
grow
tired
of
its
a
first
class
beer
dover
this
is
an
exceptional
apa
almost
an
ipa
for
me
love
the
flavors
and
balance
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
try
it
its
super
tasty
enough
with
the
analysis
this
is
one
of
hell
of
beer
a
job
well
done
by
three
floyds
recommended
o
when
drinking
this
i
was
expecting
a
fuller
version
of
their
pride
and
joy
ale
what
i
got
was
a
fruitier
brew
with
more
distinct
flavors
all
things
considered
though
i
cant
say
that
i
think
its
a
better
beer
its
about
on
par
with
pj
the
nonsessionable
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
session
brews
great
stuff
i
usually
prefer
the
more
hoppy
apas
but
this
is
just
awesome
overall
a
fantastic
apa
might
be
the
best
one
ive
had
oi
usually
prefer
the
more
hoppy
pales
but
this
offers
something
new
it
does
the
style
well
overall
a
very
good
beer
though
im
usually
more
of
an
ipa
guy
delicious
would
drink
again
o
d
excellent
beer
it
lives
up
to
its
reputation
o
buy
this
beer
trade
for
this
beer
drool
o
good
beer
pushes
the
line
between
styles
but
very
drinkable
this
is
my
deserted
island
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
yet
i
havent
been
exposed
to
many
apas
in
general
but
this
just
became
my
1
on
my
list
thanks
mark
the
drinkability
was
pleasant
and
such
great
characteristics
with
this
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
trying
new
styles
or
need
a
good
apa
havent
seen
this
one
around
st
louis
before
and
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
a
cousin
out
of
town
who
gets
good
beer
in
indiana
cheers
mark
o
good
always
a
great
treat
to
try
some
three
floyds
beers
being
so
far
from
them
hope
to
see
their
brewery
some
day
othis
is
a
nice
wellbuilt
and
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
green
hoppy
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
overpower
except
for
maybe
being
a
little
overly
bitter
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
super
hoppy
beers
but
when
i
get
a
craving
for
some
hops
this
one
is
on
my
short
list
o
i
prefer
my
pale
ales
to
be
a
little
more
stripped
down
and
simplistic
with
subtle
nuances
again
with
the
snpa
this
is
trying
a
little
too
hard
to
be
great
and
forgets
to
be
good
first
25
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
solid
lasting
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
beer
is
a
very
deep
copper
red
aroma
has
strong
citruspine
notes
with
some
evidence
of
herbal
tea
in
the
background
taste
also
has
floral
hoppy
notes
with
an
understated
burnt
caramel
presence
as
well
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
thin
overall
a
very
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
another
winner
from
fff
this
reminded
me
more
of
an
ipa
in
the
nose
though
the
hops
and
malts
did
balance
out
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
a
very
well
done
apa
overall
love
this
beer
pours
a
perfect
darkishgolden
and
smells
of
awesome
grapefruityness
the
hops
really
stand
out
as
in
most
3
floyds
beers
head
was
1
5
and
laced
fairly
nicely
along
the
glass
this
might
be
my
favorite
overall
beer
and
its
quite
drinkable
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
ccb
pint
glass
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
not
a
bad
lookin
beer
at
all
aroma
of
crazy
hops
with
some
malts
is
this
an
ipa
taste
follows
the
nose
but
with
a
little
more
balance
of
hops
and
malts
finishes
with
tangy
hops
on
the
tongue
the
is
a
really
good
beer
its
one
of
those
pales
like
dales
pale
ale
that
borders
on
an
ipa
o
ive
had
ipas
that
dont
deliver
what
this
beer
does
really
a
spectacular
example
of
what
is
possible
in
an
apa
alpha
king
does
seem
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
true
apa
i
aint
complaining
because
thats
just
my
game
i
will
be
looking
for
a
clone
to
brew
and
if
you
know
me
you
know
that
is
the
ultimate
compliment
well
done
fff
maybe
my
expectations
were
just
too
high
here
for
a
brew
titled
the
alpha
king
as
far
as
hops
go
this
one
is
definitely
not
the
king
maybe
back
in
the
day
this
was
considered
hoppy
overall
a
decent
brew
but
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malt
flavors
and
aromas
for
the
hops
to
really
shine
in
my
opinion
perhaps
one
i
will
not
be
seeking
out
again
any
time
soon
with
the
many
other
options
these
days
glad
to
have
tried
though
overall
its
just
an
ok
pale
ale
not
bad
just
not
great
if
you
have
the
option
of
buying
a
daisy
cutter
and
i
know
this
isnt
really
a
fair
option
to
many
buy
the
dc
daisy
cutter
is
by
far
a
top
example
of
the
apa
style
and
has
a
certain
crispness
to
it
that
alpha
king
cant
boast
thanks
again
to
sean9689
for
an
excellent
beer
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
when
i
am
in
the
distro
area
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
light
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
with
some
refreshing
bubbles
that
cleanly
remove
the
bitterness
after
your
taste
buds
are
done
with
it
a
solid
example
of
a
well
made
pale
ale
a
very
pleasantly
dry
and
bitter
finish
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
reasonable
abv
that
makes
it
very
difficult
not
to
knock
back
all
six
of
my
stock
at
one
sitting
all
in
all
a
tasty
beer
that
holds
interest
not
my
idea
of
an
apa
but
well
worth
checking
out
just
the
same
overall
im
probably
underrating
this
to
be
fair
its
pretty
good
d
easy
to
drink
and
quite
affordable
ill
have
another
glass
check
this
one
out
if
you
havnt
already
i
think
i
liked
it
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
a
fantastic
beer
from
an
awesome
brewery
poured
a
copper
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
beige
head
on
it
lots
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
great
smelling
beer
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
good
hop
flavor
with
some
citrus
notes
as
well
pretty
well
balanced
beer
easy
to
drink
light
mouthfeel
this
beer
went
down
really
smooth
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
it
in
the
future
a
damn
crisp
and
tasty
hop
forward
ale
that
i
would
argue
doesnt
quite
fit
the
category
it
is
placed
in
that
aside
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
back
home
drink
ability
is
good
and
overall
a
wicked
tasty
apa
there
has
yet
to
be
a
day
when
this
wouldnt
bring
a
smile
to
my
face
just
an
amazing
beer
and
beyond
worthy
of
the
reviews
copper
amber
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
a
bit
of
sweet
maltiness
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
tropical
fruit
and
pine
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
mildly
sweet
malts
and
floral
hops
low
carbonation
and
body
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
exceptional
first
review
its
about
time
notes
alpha
king
is
brewed
with
centennial
cascade
and
warrior
hops
and
is
one
of
3
floyds
flagship
brews
ive
seen
a
sixer
of
this
at
pretty
much
every
citywide
and
belmont
in
the
area
as
well
as
martins
supermarket
o
excellent
pale
ale
thought
it
wouldnt
be
hoppy
enough
for
my
liking
but
it
definitely
hit
the
spot
cheers
overall
im
sad
i
only
bought
one
of
these
but
i
would
definitely
seek
this
one
out
actively
again
a
great
citrus
pale
ale
that
i
could
enjoy
any
time
of
the
year
o
pretty
good
pale
ale
but
im
underwhelmed
though
i
had
high
expectations
not
something
id
search
out
again
but
nice
to
try
once
hope
my
bottle
was
fresh
and
an
accurate
representation
of
this
beer
overall
this
is
absolutely
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
three
floyds
works
such
wonderously
hoppy
magic
that
really
raises
the
bar
for
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
day
oamazing
get
this
if
you
can
no
way
this
is
just
a
pale
ale
cause
it
kicks
all
other
pale
ale
asses
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
rough
ended
as
mentioned
in
the
taste
but
overall
its
a
crisp
and
juicy
beer
this
isnt
its
strong
point
but
i
think
it
traded
this
for
the
taste
and
nose
drinkability
is
quite
good
on
the
other
hand
as
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
only
slightly
harsh
at
the
end
i
think
i
get
the
fervor
around
this
brewery
after
having
this
and
some
of
their
other
beers
everything
is
phenomenal
ive
been
on
ba
for
over
a
year
now
and
have
had
several
alpha
kings
in
an
effort
to
temper
my
bias
ive
tried
several
other
apas
to
compare
honestly
they
dont
measure
up
its
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
truly
am
fortunate
living
in
indiana
if
you
can
buy
it
do
so
if
not
buddy
up
with
someone
and
trade
for
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
apa
alpha
king
has
it
all
lots
of
citrus
hops
and
a
great
malt
backbone
three
floyds
has
done
a
great
job
crafting
this
brew
highly
recommended
for
the
style
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
very
good
beer
similar
to
others
out
there
though
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
would
have
liked
a
stronger
presence
of
the
citrus
in
the
finish
though
the
sweetness
you
get
as
it
all
washes
away
made
this
a
great
beer
to
start
the
night
with
very
good
this
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
nice
tight
one
finger
head
that
faces
down
to
a
collar
and
leaves
good
lace
behind
on
the
nose
are
earthy
caramel
malts
that
i
dont
remember
being
around
before
but
on
top
of
that
is
a
huge
orange
peel
and
other
citrus
note
assortment
in
the
mouth
is
more
of
the
same
maybe
with
the
caramel
hanging
back
a
bit
further
and
the
orange
peel
mixed
with
some
dirtiness
really
a
great
hop
profile
thats
a
little
different
than
the
centennial
bombs
im
most
familiar
with
like
twohearted
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
with
a
big
bitter
finish
it
goes
down
really
fast
and
my
two
bottles
were
gone
quickly
one
of
the
great
fake
session
brews
of
the
upper
midwest
at
least
those
that
ive
had
experience
with
and
something
of
a
highwater
mark
for
pale
ales
a
good
draft
when
i
put
it
in
the
pond
of
pale
ales
i
rate
it
towards
the
top
yet
the
hoppiness
almost
warrants
it
being
amongst
ipas
in
which
case
id
put
it
towards
the
middle
of
its
peers
how
you
review
it
depends
on
if
you
wanna
group
it
with
the
labels
title
or
your
or
your
palates
conclusion
this
is
a
great
anytime
brew
its
perfect
for
just
about
any
occasion
and
a
good
beer
to
kick
off
spring
drinkability
full
of
hop
flavor
but
doesnt
pack
the
bitter
whallop
of
an
ipa
or
iipa
very
wellbalanced
from
the
perspective
of
someone
who
likes
a
hoppier
apa
highly
sessionable
and
highly
recommended
one
of
my
new
goto
beers
in
indy
my
new
home
town
what
a
great
surprise
this
was
thanks
to
claaark13
for
sending
this
extra
my
way
he
was
the
second
mid
westerner
to
send
this
to
me
as
an
extra
must
be
rough
having
this
one
cluttering
the
shelves
at
the
local
bottle
shop
served
from
a
bottle
in
to
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
ambery
coppery
color
lacing
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
all
the
way
down
and
lives
on
when
the
beer
is
gone
theres
a
nice
citrus
smack
to
the
scent
that
carries
on
to
the
taste
theres
a
bitter
sour
grapefruit
taste
that
hits
me
pretty
hard
as
well
that
seems
to
make
the
alcohol
feel
a
littler
higher
to
my
mouth
than
rated
that
bitter
bite
kept
going
thru
the
whole
glass
and
one
or
two
would
be
enough
for
me
in
an
evening
d
not
as
drinkable
as
id
hoped
a
really
well
balanced
beer
here
very
sessionable
in
this
guys
opinion
i
found
this
beer
very
amiable
and
incredibly
drinkable
the
best
three
floyds
offering
i
have
had
to
date
and
i
think
i
have
to
include
dark
lord
in
that
statement
as
well
drink
and
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
very
good
easy
drinking
yet
packs
the
flavor
you
want
yet
keeps
the
abv
to
a
drinkmorethanthree
level
highly
recommended
d
very
drinkable
well
balanced
the
malts
and
breadywoody
taste
mixed
with
the
hops
and
the
piney
taste
makes
this
brew
excellent
highly
recommend
this
one
taste
is
quite
bitter
lots
more
harsh
flavors
rather
than
the
light
fruitiness
that
the
nose
implied
there
is
a
pretty
strong
graininess
that
takes
the
flavor
down
a
bit
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
and
smooth
d
easy
to
drink
but
really
surprised
me
not
really
a
pale
ale
but
still
really
good
i
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
d
this
is
different
it
is
really
sweet
to
start
and
hoppy
on
the
finish
i
love
the
smell
i
think
i
need
to
do
some
more
research
drinking
on
this
one
d
i
could
down
multiple
pints
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
glad
i
had
this
great
beer
on
tap
my
first
beer
from
three
floyds
did
not
disappoint
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
brews
alpha
king
would
constantly
be
in
my
fridge
if
i
had
access
to
it
the
mouth
is
full
and
very
thick
for
the
style
while
the
head
hangs
around
and
leaves
nice
spots
and
legs
of
lace
around
the
glass
just
an
overall
fantastic
beer
that
does
everything
right
and
will
sorely
be
missed
heavybodied
alpha
king
is
a
big
and
assertive
brew
for
ipalovers
though
its
categorized
as
an
american
pale
ale
and
a
definite
winner
ill
be
drinking
more
of
these
drinkability
good
a
nice
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
few
will
drink
this
again
soon
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
fingers
worth
of
off
white
head
quite
a
bit
of
grapefruit
hops
in
the
nose
just
a
little
bready
malt
mixed
in
taste
is
similar
with
the
malt
coming
forward
more
to
balance
the
hops
almost
perfectly
theres
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
its
not
overpowering
at
all
carbonation
is
perfect
theres
a
nice
a
residual
hop
resin
that
coats
the
palate
after
every
sip
body
may
be
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
style
which
keeps
drinkability
down
a
bit
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
overall
for
an
apa
but
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
d
this
is
a
really
nice
apa
nice
and
hop
forward
like
i
like
them
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
not
sure
if
its
something
id
trade
for
again
but
would
be
more
than
happy
to
knock
back
a
few
more
this
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
good
size
head
that
lasted
through
out
the
beer
there
is
a
strong
hoppy
and
grapfruit
aroma
there
is
a
strong
hoppy
taste
but
it
lacks
that
bite
that
some
pale
ales
have
also
a
bitter
grapefruit
like
taste
is
detectable
not
very
carbonated
and
could
use
some
more
carbonation
overall
a
reallly
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
cheers
to
the
alpha
king
overall
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
however
the
taste
puts
me
off
a
bit
wish
there
were
less
early
bittering
hops
to
prevent
such
severe
dryness
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
and
am
likely
to
pick
some
up
again
in
the
future
drinkability
very
good
drinking
beer
that
i
would
buy
the
hell
out
of
it
were
readily
available
to
me
another
good
brew
from
three
floyds
i
was
very
impressed
d
a
good
staple
session
apa
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
but
not
a
bad
one
to
try
d
drinkability
is
moderate
as
i
look
back
on
the
notes
i
describe
it
as
inoffensive
but
not
very
inspired
or
worth
seeking
out
a
standby
in
three
floyds
rotation
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
find
something
comparable
in
local
shelves
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
medium
bodied
and
very
hop
forward
for
the
style
with
a
blast
of
bitter
earthy
hops
that
are
countered
by
sweet
citrus
presence
and
a
subtle
malt
backbone
hints
of
pine
needle
grapefruit
citrus
peel
mango
and
pineapple
as
well
as
a
subtle
biscuitgraham
cracker
flavor
that
provides
nice
balance
this
beer
is
much
closer
to
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
with
lots
of
oily
resinous
hop
flavor
and
a
nice
dry
finish
complex
well
balanced
and
extremely
quaffable
recommended
okay
there
is
not
much
i
can
add
to
the
reviews
already
given
this
is
a
great
apa
i
give
it
4s
to
4
5s
across
the
board
its
an
a
beer
if
you
can
find
it
drink
it
watch
dating
however
i
really
liked
it
and
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
one
bottle
from
the
store
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
id
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
is
a
session
but
i
will
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
beers
great
beer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
hints
of
brown
in
the
middle
quick
head
leaving
decent
lacing
it
has
a
musty
orange
bitterness
smell
with
lemon
citrus
taste
is
very
bitter
a
very
good
hop
bomb
powerful
orange
and
grapefruit
with
grassy
undertones
this
beer
leaves
a
tackiness
in
your
mouth
with
some
malty
sugar
stick
a
good
beer
and
i
would
definitely
like
more
d
really
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
massive
thanks
to
aasher
for
this
as
an
extra
in
a
past
inperson
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
yelloworange
with
a
two
and
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
citrus
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
chocolate
citrus
and
citrus
hop
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
excellent
brew
very
well
balanced
and
complex
not
too
much
missing
on
this
one
if
you
havent
tried
this
before
get
off
your
ass
or
trade
for
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
not
one
to
drink
many
of
but
one
to
savor
and
make
last
a
while
d
extremely
drinkable
had
no
problem
finishing
most
of
a
growler
by
myself
the
finish
leads
me
to
keep
drinking
more
and
more
theres
nothing
too
special
about
it
but
when
i
finish
my
glass
i
realize
how
good
it
was
and
pour
another
id
definitely
like
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
of
the
better
american
pale
ales
ive
had
holding
its
own
with
a
lot
of
ipas
d
phenomenal
apa
for
the
hopheads
had
this
beer
on
draft
in
chicago
and
it
tastes
just
as
good
down
here
out
of
the
bottle
would
love
to
have
access
to
three
floyds
pours
a
beautiful
amber
gold
with
a
ton
of
white
head
the
head
hangs
out
for
ever
and
there
is
beautiful
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
hoppy
and
malty
smells
as
hoppy
as
any
ipa
ive
had
some
light
citrus
and
piney
hints
on
the
nose
tastes
very
balanced
between
a
solid
malt
profile
and
some
great
hops
pine
and
citrus
on
the
tongue
a
bit
of
grapefruit
as
well
very
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
a
top
notch
brew
this
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
fell
in
love
with
and
sometimes
i
forget
about
this
beer
however
it
never
disappoints
well
done
da
damn
fine
midwest
apa
masquerading
as
a
west
coast
ipa
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
so
far
d
pretty
damn
high
admittedly
im
biasedi
cut
my
craft
beer
teeth
on
alpha
king
and
gumballhead
but
this
brew
really
is
tops
in
the
10six
pack
chicago
market
it
trumps
many
other
beers
in
the
style
for
sure
great
hop
and
malt
complexity
for
an
acceptable
price
d
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
hits
the
malthop
balance
just
right
which
isnt
easy
to
do
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
body
to
the
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
d
a
very
drinable
beer
not
something
im
reaching
for
first
in
the
fridge
but
definitely
a
old
standby
that
i
could
always
rely
on
bummed
out
that
fff
doesnt
distribute
to
ohio
that
needs
to
happen
again
this
is
one
to
savor
the
cpj
big
american
pale
ale
a
hop
lovers
cult
beer
and
three
floyds
flagship
beer
i
understand
is
brewed
with
centennial
cascade
and
warrior
hops
pours
a
reddish
amberdark
copper
hue
not
much
going
on
with
the
nose
but
pick
up
a
little
citrus
aroma
taste
a
bold
citrus
hop
character
mouthability
was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
drinks
down
smooth
and
dangerously
a
close
second
best
pale
ale
i
ever
had
next
to
stone
pale
ale
i
really
wish
three
floyds
would
start
dating
their
bottles
so
i
would
be
able
to
fully
vouch
the
freshness
of
a
3f
beer
d
this
is
one
wicked
pale
ale
drinking
it
again
after
so
many
months
i
am
reminded
why
i
love
this
beer
so
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
its
a
little
subdued
from
its
age
i
will
update
when
i
get
a
fresher
batch
d
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
an
ecru
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
mainly
of
hop
characteristics
such
as
grapefruit
and
floral
notes
there
are
some
hints
on
the
nose
of
caramel
but
they
arent
too
strong
the
taste
is
interesting
as
it
is
a
combination
of
hop
fruitiness
and
a
slight
nutty
background
the
pale
malt
is
still
rather
hidden
behind
both
of
those
flavors
the
mouthfeel
has
some
bitterness
that
youd
assume
with
an
ipa
but
its
still
quite
a
drinkable
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
an
apa
d
this
glass
went
down
fast
lets
hope
fff
starts
distributing
across
ohio
again
soon
somewhat
disappointed
ive
heard
such
great
things
about
this
beer
but
im
finding
it
to
be
kind
of
blah
im
on
the
third
of
a
six
pack
so
it
isnt
just
one
bad
bottle
fff
needs
to
start
bottle
dating
especially
for
these
hoppy
brews
not
sure
if
this
is
old
or
what
i
had
a
friend
bring
this
back
from
indiana
for
me
but
based
on
this
experience
i
will
not
try
this
beer
again
until
the
fff
starts
dating
bottles
d
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
thanks
to
fff
and
their
lack
of
dating
but
its
damn
good
not
as
hoppy
as
snpa
but
very
easy
to
drink
i
wonder
how
this
would
taste
on
draught
the
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
i
can
see
why
this
is
ranked
so
highly
d
staple
session
beer
that
ill
need
to
get
some
of
my
ipaavid
friends
to
try
i
think
theyd
be
quite
surprised
that
its
a
pale
ale
considering
the
amount
of
that
bitterness
overall
a
really
impressive
american
pale
ale
certainly
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
style
the
really
strong
hop
character
is
definitely
the
emphasis
here
and
this
beers
biggest
strength
ontap
at
bar
deville
hard
to
go
wrong
with
3fs
great
pour
from
the
bartender
rich
amber
color
with
a
hoppy
but
balanced
nose
what
a
great
beer
will
do
a
bottle
review
sometime
too
try
it
for
yourself
if
you
can
find
it
i
go
out
sometimes
even
when
i
feel
like
kicking
back
and
watching
a
movie
to
drink
this
ontap
because
6
packs
are
so
hard
to
find
even
though
this
brewery
is
not
far
from
chicago
light
to
medium
in
the
feel
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
quite
a
bold
herbal
hop
character
with
toasty
caramel
to
offset
the
bitterness
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
that
is
easy
drinking
d
really
good
i
am
starting
to
think
that
ipas
are
all
really
drinkable
but
the
flavor
on
this
one
keeps
it
apart
from
the
rest
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
but
ive
had
other
apas
that
i
enjoy
more
i
sucked
this
one
down
for
some
reason
i
like
this
better
the
second
time
around
it
helps
to
go
into
it
not
expecting
a
pale
ale
d
i
could
drink
an
infinite
amount
of
this
beer
and
continue
to
be
happy
and
curiously
engaged
had
on
tap
at
pazzos
in
lexington
came
to
me
a
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
lingered
for
a
good
amount
of
time
and
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
fresh
hops
citrus
lemon
and
perhaps
some
tropical
fruit
taste
was
just
what
i
expected
fresh
citrus
hops
with
a
good
bready
malt
backbone
and
a
great
zesty
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
almost
creamy
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
brings
out
the
hops
in
this
beer
even
more
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
great
session
beer
by
three
floyds
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
brew
it
would
be
awesome
if
i
had
access
this
would
be
a
regular
6
pack
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
definitely
give
this
a
try
for
a
very
well
done
session
brew
definitely
worth
hunting
really
nice
pale
ale
d
although
this
is
an
excellent
apa
i
wouldnt
say
that
its
especially
easy
to
drink
its
a
big
apa
with
more
body
than
most
which
makes
it
a
sipper
but
id
say
sipping
is
very
easy
to
do
i
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
but
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
it
and
may
had
ended
it
there
if
another
one
was
in
the
fridge
lower
drinkability
doesnt
take
away
from
its
quality
however
and
id
love
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
d
im
finding
this
very
drinkable
and
even
at
the
abv
i
can
see
myself
having
several
in
a
sitting
this
is
more
hop
forward
than
many
beers
in
the
style
and
im
loving
it
for
that
this
is
a
solid
apa
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
along
side
sierra
nevada
dales
pale
ale
too
bad
is
not
sold
in
california
d
very
good
pale
ale
good
session
beer
terrifiic
smell
it
seems
like
its
trying
to
get
as
close
to
being
an
ipa
without
crossing
the
line
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
d
i
down
a
sixer
wo
thinking
and
the
draft
pints
go
down
as
smooth
im
really
impressed
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
think
it
is
clearly
falling
into
the
ipa
style
guidelines
much
too
big
to
be
a
pale
ale
fantastic
i
would
like
to
try
others
from
this
brewery
d
alpha
king
was
who
i
thought
it
was
this
is
the
best
apa
on
the
planet
there
are
so
many
flavors
and
balance
in
the
brew
its
definitely
sessionable
and
tasty
i
swear
if
this
brewery
could
ever
get
to
syracuse
i
would
drink
mountains
of
this
stuff
i
will
get
to
munster
somehow
this
summer
dthis
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
really
works
well
as
a
session
for
someone
like
me
who
loves
hops
this
is
an
apa
on
steroids
this
is
an
amazing
session
beer
if
you
are
a
hop
head
so
much
hop
flavor
and
aroma
in
a
nice
drinkable
package
this
is
only
the
third
fff
beer
i
have
tried
and
so
far
they
are
three
for
three
probably
one
of
the
best
american
pales
that
i
have
ever
had
delicious
must
try
there
is
no
date
printed
on
the
bottle
but
its
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
good
six
months
perhaps
the
hop
aromas
would
be
more
overpowering
in
a
fresher
example
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
overall
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
overall
for
an
apa
but
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
best
pale
ale
in
the
world
one
of
my
favorite
apas
hits
the
palate
just
right
d
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
6
5
abv
is
a
tad
high
to
be
truly
sessionable
however
it
wouldnt
be
difficult
in
the
least
for
me
to
polish
off
a
sixer
of
this
on
my
own
drink
i
want
more
i
have
to
get
more
every
beer
drinker
should
have
this
apa
one
of
my
top
3
beers
since
i
first
tried
it
3
years
ago
d
very
good
two
pints
or
so
would
be
fine
all
in
all
this
is
another
great
beer
from
the
guys
at
fff
overall
this
beer
is
great
highly
recommended
as
mentioned
it
tastes
like
a
beefed
up
pride
and
joy
a
little
more
hop
presence
which
is
great
i
definitely
would
choose
this
over
the
pride
and
joy
if
both
are
available
this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
white
head
this
beer
has
a
great
citrus
hop
aroma
to
it
the
flavor
is
fairly
strong
with
citrus
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
a
lingering
citrus
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
im
not
sure
how
this
is
classified
as
just
a
pale
ale
but
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
at
over
6
im
sure
i
could
get
in
trouble
with
a
few
of
these
the
citrus
is
bright
and
fresh
and
the
malt
is
quite
tasty
d
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
so
i
could
try
to
session
it
this
brew
pour
a
beautiful
orangeamber
color
with
a
great
head
it
definitely
smells
of
hops
and
citrus
hops
are
much
more
subtle
than
i
expected
as
the
smell
is
much
stronger
than
the
taste
perhaps
the
most
refreshing
pale
ale
ive
ever
tried
initial
citrus
and
hop
flavor
dominate
as
i
drink
with
an
ever
so
slight
sweetness
and
a
mild
bitterness
kicks
in
as
it
goes
down
a
perfect
balance
of
bittering
flavor
and
aroma
hops
are
used
in
this
brew
lacing
is
evident
all
the
way
down
to
my
last
sip
tastes
like
it
should
be
around
4
to
5
abv
but
is
6
5
longer
i
love
how
close
it
is
to
an
ipa
and
stradles
the
line
but
the
malt
just
holds
it
back
enough
i
wish
i
had
a
steady
supply
of
this
beer
so
i
could
experiment
more
but
alas
it
cant
be
true
ive
just
begun
experimenting
with
three
floyds
beers
but
this
one
certainly
helps
point
me
in
the
right
direction
d
excellent
beer
wish
everyone
had
access
to
this
one
hard
to
drink
just
one
but
its
all
i
got
enough
said
juicy
grainy
biscuity
malts
citrusy
sweet
fruity
hops
nice
color
not
much
head
but
not
bad
at
all
amazing
overall
a
great
session
beer
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
of
any
style
cant
believe
how
much
flavor
this
has
for
an
apa
almost
an
ipa
but
not
quite
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
little
chewy
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
solid
flavor
even
with
the
higher
abv
for
the
style
everything
meshes
well
d
very
pleasant
taste
make
this
beer
one
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
very
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
and
the
hoppymalty
split
is
somewhat
confusing
beer
hides
its
alcohol
level
of
the
bigger
hoppier
pale
ales
dales
etc
i
think
this
is
definitely
best
in
class
slightly
too
malt
focused
for
my
tastes
overall
definitely
closer
to
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
but
the
malty
sweetness
does
pull
it
a
little
closer
to
style
its
a
big
tasty
brew
nonetheless
and
a
great
choice
for
a
flagship
beer

the

looks

then
you

the
taste
does
not

at

the
hops
carrying
through

a

nice

it
tasted
like
apricot
and

nope
the
foam
resides
quickly
after
giving
a
good
show
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
proceeds
to
lace
the
glass
as
i
continue
to
drink
the
smell
has
a
certain
fruit
characteristic
to
it
and
makes
alpha

smell
kind
of
bitter
its
very
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
actually
in
its
smell
and
grapefruit
flavor
is
initially
rather
tangy
with
hop
oils
and
citrus
and
then
mellows
with
a
maltier
finish
this
is
pretty
tasty
id
love
to
have
this
as
a
session
beer
d
really
goes
down
smoothly

very

pretty

not
as
bitter
as
many
ipas

to
get

i
could

drinking

cheers
thanks
again
dan
along
with
southern
star
pinebelt
palethis
is
probably
my
favorite
apa
poured
three
floyds
alpha
king
pale
ale
into
glass
and
first
noticed
its
nice
citrus
smell
hints
of
grapefruit
which
is
different
and
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
head
i
do
believe
i
noticed
the
grapefruit
in
the
taste
as
well
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
would
like
to
try
again
d
very
flavorful
yet
well
balanced
this
was
my
first
taste
of
anything
from
three
floyds
and
it
didnt
disappoint
alpha
king
is
superb
it
has
supplanted
schlafly
dryhopped
apa
as
my
favorite
beer
in
the
style
it
has
tremendous
hop
flavor
enough
that
i
would
take
an
alpha
king
over
a
number
of
fine
ipas
this
beer
makes
me
weep
bitter
tears
over
the
fact
that
three
floyds
does
not
ship
to
missouri
as
of
yet
notes
definitely
a
beer
for
hop
lovers
one
of
the
hoppiest
although
most
balanced
ales
i
have
had
reminds
me
of
sweetwater
420
but
with
much
better
balance
with
the
malts
a
go
to
for
a
hop
fix
this
one
can
quench
your
hop
thirst
with
a
unique
and
well
balanced
mix
of
hops
d
well
i
only
bought
2
but
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
i
found
this
on
tap
at
a
hidden
gem
of
a
beer
bar
30
minutes
out
of
town
lucky
me
it
pours
a
rich
amber
orange
color
with
two
inches
of
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
spectacular
hops
are
at
the
forefront
but
sweet
malt
and
citrus
fruit
are
major
players
as
well
then
i
take
a
sip
i
took
a
double
take
after
i
swallowed
this
tastes
much
more
like
an
ipa
then
just
a
pale
ale
the
flavor
is
very
hoppy
but
not
a
hop
bomb
at
all
the
malt
is
well
balanced
with
the
hops
making
for
a
super
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
orange
peel
soursweetness
that
comes
out
as
well
the
mouhfeel
is
awfully
pleasant
medium
body
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
this
is
a
top
beer
on
my
list
i
spent
the
entire
night
enjoying
one
after
another
i
will
be
visiting
my
this
bar
again
a
30
minute
drive
is
nothing
to
enjoy
a
drink
with
the
king
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
d
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
wish
that
i
didnt
have
to
trade
for
it
if
it
was
distributed
in
my
area
it
would
absolutely
be
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
and
again
im
imagining
this
flowing
directly
from
the
tap
at
the
brewhouse
in
munster
into
my
20
oz
imperial
glass
on
a
hot
day
one
day
one
day
all
in
all
this
is
a
better
beer
than
i
may
have
indicated
in
this
review
i
seem
to
have
fixated
on
one
perceived
flaw
that
shaped
my
overall
interpretation
of
the
beer
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
from
time
to
time
pours
dark
amber
with
a
respectable
head
a
good
citrus
aroma
strong
but
not
overbearing
the
taste
was
a
sweet
grapefruit
and
i
had
no
bitter
aftertaste
excellent
feel
is
smooth
with
a
nice
body
for
an
apa
i
could
drink
a
half
dozen
of
them
everything
good
about
an
ipa
but
kept
none
of
the
bad
my
first
taste
of
a
3floyds
effort
im
impressed
drinkability
is
high
the
flavors
are
just
strong
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
and
the
abv
allows
you
to
pound
these
beers
but
not
be
abliterated
after
a
six
pack
of
them
in
one
night
the
drinkability
of
theses
pale
is
outstanding
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
6er
of
these
in
a
night
if
i
had
regular
access
to
this
beer
i
had
trouble
not
drinking
this
too
fast
while
trying
to
take
tasting
notes
get
some
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
with
good
carbonation
had
this
as
part
of
a
tasting
session
with
a
buddy
a
while
back
poured
an
amber
color
with
white
foamy
head
that
left
decent
lacing
smelled
of
citrus
hops
malt
and
caramel
tasted
of
earthy
hops
malt
and
caramel
smooth
but
slightly
overcarbed
could
drink
more
overall
this
pale
ale
is
great
i
think
it
is
really
hard
for
a
brewer
to
brew
a
pale
ale
that
tastes
very
good
but
fff
did
a
great
job
this
one
went
fast
and
even
the
family
enjoyed
a
few
samples
this
is
an
ipa
at
its
core
but
incedibly
drinkable
its
sweet
but
hoppy
and
bitter
served
in
a
pint
glass
redorange
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
super
fine
carbonation
bubbles
smell
is
a
blast
of
pacific
northwest
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
caramel
malt
piney
citrus
hops
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
super
creamy
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
an
excellent
apa
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
though
but
it
doesnt
matter
what
the
classification
its
great
a
very
well
crafted
beer
medium
to
slightly
heavy
bodied
with
the
rich
malty
backbone
the
light
carbonation
is
a
nice
touch
somewhat
reminds
me
of
a
light
barleywine
i
really
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
that
12
of
these
in
anyone
setting
the
aforementioned
metallic
aspect
builds
to
a
point
where
it
becomes
cumbersome
and
annoying
i
just
wish
it
step
out
of
the
way
and
leave
this
otherwise
well
crafted
beer
alone
drinkability
so
high
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
good
whenever
wherever
and
with
anything
i
realize
three
floyds
take
on
most
of
their
beers
is
hoppier
than
traditionally
done
but
they
do
hops
very
well
possibly
best
cask
at
clark
street
ale
house
in
chicago
surprisingly
dark
amber
pour
with
a
cream
colored
head
piney
hops
dominate
the
aroma
of
coarse
but
some
malt
also
taste
has
some
nice
caramel
covered
apple
citrus
and
the
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
just
enough
carbonation
hand
pull
helps
this
of
coarse
finish
is
not
overly
bitter
not
a
frequenter
of
pales
but
this
is
the
best
american
pale
ive
had
three
floyds
hop
heavy
style
obviously
works
well
with
this
d
again
one
of
those
beers
that
pisses
me
off
i
cannot
simply
go
to
a
store
to
get
probably
the
single
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
both
the
bottled
and
tap
versions
are
excellent
with
both
showing
slightly
different
characteristics
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
but
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
tickle
the
mouth
well
done
flavor
is
slightly
bitter
at
first
sip
but
this
gives
way
to
a
big
malty
caramel
sweetness
that
finishes
with
a
grapefruit
punch
this
is
much
sweeter
than
i
though
it
would
be
but
i
like
it
i
like
it
alot
dang
fine
brew
i
want
more
of
this
d
very
good
i
could
enjoy
a
nice
evening
with
a
few
of
these
good
brew
here
just
brilliant
tasting
notes
from
23
jun
2009
d
this
is
quite
a
beer
but
i
wish
it
was
fresher
i
dont
know
if
i
would
consider
this
an
apa
i
think
it
is
more
bordering
on
an
ipa
however
i
know
i
really
like
it
no
matter
what
style
they
call
it
drinkability
very
high
the
incredible
balance
and
dryness
combine
to
make
a
very
drinkable
beer
start
a
big
meal
with
this
brew
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
taste
always
seems
to
let
me
down
but
its
still
a
great
beer
sometimes
i
need
a
reminder
of
why
its
great
living
in
indiana
simply
an
outstanding
pale
ale
d
a
very
drinkable
apa
that
goes
well
on
a
nice
warm
day
or
any
day
for
that
matter
taste
very
nice
citrus
taste
with
strong
hoppiness
but
not
an
overpowering
amount
which
i
really
enjoy
for
that
reason
very
aromatic
take
on
the
apa
lots
of
citrus
hop
aroma
but
still
had
some
caramel
malt
character
a
light
amber
appearance
with
good
head
retention
good
clean
hop
flavor
with
a
good
balance
with
the
malt
tasted
as
part
of
a
sampler
so
it
was
less
hoppy
than
the
ipa
but
still
had
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
the
bitterness
didnt
linger
and
finished
clean
had
a
good
mouthfeel
carbonation
was
just
right
even
with
the
hops
68
ibus
it
was
not
overly
astringent
and
was
very
refreshing
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
definitely
their
flagship
beer
its
not
to
style
but
its
a
damn
fine
brew
d
this
is
a
tasty
pale
ale
i
wanted
another
pint
of
this
brew
right
away
d
very
drinkable
for
such
powerful
flavors
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
its
awesomely
hoppy
and
it
has
a
nice
dry
finish
it
tastes
a
lot
stronger
than
the
6
abv
or
the
pale
ale
title
would
have
suggested
this
beer
was
great
d
yeah
its
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
a
lot
going
on
for
a
6
brew
my
first
three
floyds
beer
is
a
good
one
but
is
this
going
to
be
enough
to
take
the
title
of
being
the
best
in
the
t
u
i
only
two
more
beers
left
well

bottle
one
of
the
hoppiest
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
pours
a
darker
ambercopper
color
with
small
white
head
aromas
are
more
malt
focused
with
only
minor
amounts
of
hops
great
balance
on
the
palate
between
hop
and
maltiness
the
flavors
are
rich
but
not
overpowering
with
the
hop
profile
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
a
pale
ale
but
thats
fffs
style
i
wish
i
lived
closer
to
this
stuff
a
very
good
beer
d
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
be
content
not
sure
if
this
is
one
id
pick
up
a
sixer
of
but
id
grab
a
pint
when
im
out
to
dinner
or
out
with
friends
anytime
really
glad
to
have
gotten
this
if
it
was
readily
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
ill
be
sure
to
get
some
again
a
very
impressive
pale
ale
or
ipa
or
dipa
whatever
you
want
to
classify
it
elite
in
class
and
execution
this
is
a
very
good
apa
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
tried
edit
2011
still
not
terribly
impressed
there
is
an
unexpected
nuttiness
to
this
beer
also
the
appearance
is
not
the
best
head
dissipates
so
quickly
decidedly
thin
i
know
this
one
is
fresh
so
this
beer
is
definitively
not
my
cup
of
tea
my
first
impression
of
fffs
and
a
good
one
maybe
a
little
misclassified
but
im
never
disappointed
by
a
good
hoppy
beer
had
this
for
the
first
time
on
tap
at
dld
and
just
had
to
pick
some
up
because
i
like
it
so
much
pours
a
very
nice
copper
almost
reddish
orange
color
that
looks
really
nice
has
about
a
one
finger
white
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
to
long
and
leaves
little
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
piney
hops
grapefruit
and
caramel
pretty
good
smell
to
it
taste
is
really
great
piney
bitter
about
halfway
through
but
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
some
other
beers
which
is
good
in
this
particular
beer
also
their
is
fruit
in
there
as
well
grapefruit
overall
the
taste
is
great
and
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
very
drinkable
as
well
not
a
low
abv
but
not
high
either
i
could
drink
this
all
night
for
sure
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
straddles
the
line
between
a
pale
ale
and
ipa
and
does
it
quite
nicely
a
fine
brew
indeed
thanks
dan
draught
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
black
with
a
dense
tan
head
the
aroma
is
super
chocolate
powered
leaning
a
little
toward
the
dark
side
but
still
milky
and
creamy
the
flavor
takes
that
and
adds
in
a
roasted
bitterness
that
doesnt
completely
blend
but
works
out
alright
the
body
is
a
little
thin
but
pretty
smooth
this
is
a
really
nice
smelling
beer
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
to
back
it
up
but
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
dont
seem
to
gel
as
well
as
they
could
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
but
i
think
its
lacking
in
a
few
departments
overall
impression
its
ok
but
disappointing
as
i
was
expecting
a
hopheads
delight
and
instead
got
a
very
sweet
and
flattish
brew
older
bottle
maybe
if
i
get
a
chance
to
try
it
again
and
have
a
different
experience
ill
adjust
my
reviewratings
accordingly
m
d
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
wonderful
mouthfeel
on
this
one
making
it
extremely
drinkable
will
satisfy
your
hop
fix
but
backs
it
up
with
the
smooth
malt
to
turn
this
one
into
a
great
session
beer
wish
this
was
readily
accessible
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
with
light
carbonation
for
a
beer
this
pleasantly
bitter
it
is
so
round
so
smooth
three
floyds
always
kills
me
in
the
mouthfeelcarbonation
departmentsomething
that
i
think
gets
overlooked
in
favor
of
their
hopcentric
approach
to
many
styles
i
could
drink
this
a
lot
unfortunately
i
can
find
good
apas
for
less
moneyim
looking
at
you
snpa
and
lake
louie
arena
premium
regardless
this
is
a
well
put
together
brew
that
pushes
the
limits
of
hop
hearty
american
pale
ales
i
could
guzzle
down
quite
a
few
of
these
there
delicious
d
a
quite
astonishing
apa
considering
the
amount
of
hop
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
one
it
could
easily
go
head
to
head
with
an
ipa
and
despite
all
of
the
hops
it
still
feels
well
balanced
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
through
the
roof
this
beer
is
excellent
has
great
flavor
is
refreshing
and
has
a
decently
low

i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
and
anywhere
overall
for
a
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
a
more
hop
profile
as
this
was
more
a
light
barleywine
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
deep
copper
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
sticky
creamy
light
ecru
foam
the
head
leaves
a
moderate
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
as
i
sip
my
way
to
the
bottom
smells
and
tastes
of
fresh
fruity
citrus
such
as
lemon
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
sweet
caramel
glazed
biscuits
and
a
welcome
bitterness
a
few
notches
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
this
is
probably
epic
on
cask
d
yes
definitely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
sessionable
for
sure
but
enjoyable
one
at
a
time
a
great
place
to
start
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
is
well
balanced
the
flavors
complement
each
other
nicely
and
are
definitely
highlighted
by
the
carbonation
and
smoothness
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orangegold
with
a
light
offwhite
head
head
doesnt
last
for
long
it
was
a
wuss
pour
so
chalk
that
up
to
me
the
cap
sticks
around
a
while
though
great
lacing
the
nose
is
citrusy
and
has
a
fresh
hoppy
aroma
but
its
not
a
hop
bomb
in
addition
to
the
hop
flavor
theres
good
malt
backing
and
as
a
result
this
is
pretty
balanced
its
smooth
and
drinkable
totally
surprised
by
this
one
i
had
heard
it
was
good
but
i
didnt
quite
understand
how
good
it
is
thought
it
would
be
an
underwhelming
runofthemill
apa
shame
on
me
for
doubting
fff
i
had
this
on
tap
and
that
tasted
better
i
ended
up
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
and
taking
it
home
with
me
really
i
was
kind
of
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
alot
darker
and
alot
more
like
an
ipa
than
i
expected
in
fact
my
friend
sampled
the
beer
and
remarked
by
calling
it
a
halfipa
and
i
think
that
nails
this
beer
on
the
head
not
that
it
was
bad
i
was
just
expecting
this
beer
to
have
more
of
a
malt
profile
to
better
balance
the
play
on
hops
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
one
i
would
have
again
one
of
the
best
im
trying
to
keep
this
review
simple
this
beer
just
kicks
ass
but
dont
take
my
word
for
it
go
out
and
get
some
and
see
for
youreself
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
brews
ever
made
do
not
miss
this
one
three
floyds
is
fast
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
gumballhead
dreadnaught
miloko
plus
etc
and
im
so
happy
to
have
regular
access
to
all
their
beers
my
mother
lives
minutes
from
three
floyds
and
i
visit
her
often
to
help
with
household
chores
this
three
floyds
offering
is
no
different
this
is
what
beer
should
taste
like
if
you
can
trade
for
this
beer
i
say
go
for
it
an
absolutely
fabulous
apa
possibly
the
best
i
have
yet
to
try
d
i
find
this
beer
to
be
an
fantastic
everyday
drinker
fff
has
never
steered
me
in
a
terrible
direction
i
could
easily
and
have
many
times
before
drink
a
sixer
of
this
brew
d
easy
to
kick
back

rich

some
might
push
this
beer
into
the
ipa
category
but
i
believe
its
right
where
it
belongs
as
a
pale
ale
its
darker
than
most
ipas
and
while
yes
it
is
very
hoppy
its
not
super
bitter
or
dry
it
really
has

i

this
is
a

representation
of
an

it
has
a
good
hop
component
without
being
harsh

a
nice

character
to
create
balance
for
the
strong

the
beer
has
amazing
layers
of
flavor
and

the
fact
that
this
beer
is
also
so
drinkable
makes
it
a
nice

on

one

the
better
pale

hazy
orangetinted
deep
amber
color
pours
with
a
one
finger
orangetinted
head
that
shortly
collapses
to
a
collar
leaves
a
fairly
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
contains
piney
and
citrusy
hops
delicately
sweetened
by
malt
a
hint
of
mango
can
also
be
found
the
taste
offers
caramel
and
pale
malt
sweetness
that
balances
the
bitterness
while
it
lasts
the
piney
and
citrusy
hops
detected
in
the
nose
dominate
the
taste
with
a
strong
hop
bite
a
hint
of
peach
in
the
background
bitterness
builds
into
the
finish
with
the
hops
becoming
crisp
and
herbal
body
is
medium
beer
feels
slick
on
the
tongue
malt
could
be
a
bit
more
chewy
though
overall
its
a
delicious
beer
that
left
me
wanting
more
d
a
bit
potent
but
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
gets
better
setting
in
your
glass
and
getting
warmer
but
is
really
good
super
chilled
as
well
overall
this
is
an
excellent
american
pale
ale
marred
only
by
poor
head
retention
this
is
an
incredible
apa
and
quickly
became
one
of
my
favorites
enjoy
d
very
high
delicious
d
supremely
drinkable
i
could
have
one
of
these
every
day
the
only
problem
is
of
course
that
three
floyds
does
not
distribute
to
socal
an
excellent
apa
worth
seeking
out
overall
top
shelf
apa
this
beer
walks
the
line
of
ipa
and
pa
as
far
as
hoppiness
goes
a
bit
heavier
on
flavors
than
most
apas
like
thats
a
problem
but
is
still
pretty
much
as
drinkable
as
them
outsanding
drinkability
im
very
glad
i
have
many
more
of
these
drinkability
i
wish
this
was
more
plentiful
in
my
area
this
beer
is
uber
drinkable
and
is
a
fantastic
complex
beer
that
will
not
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
taste
the
same
everytime
that
is
not
because
its
inconsistent
between
brewings
but
rather
because
the
taste
will
conjur
up
different
memories
and
imagery
everytime
its
that
good
d
the
greatest
apa
that
ive
tried
so
far
its
just
a
shame
i
cant
get
it
very
often
an
american
craft
brewing
classic
this
is
definitely
an
ipa
in
pale
ale
clothing
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
a
little
bit
chewy
carobnation
is
very
subdued
and
overall
its
very
smooth
and
almost
too
easy
to
drink
awesome

served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
orange
almost
brown
color
a
thick
tight
two

offwhite
head
formed
with
a
rather
easy
pour
awesome
nose
on
this
one
very
bitter
hop
aroma
grapefruit
pine
pineapple
with
a
nice
balancing
malt
aroma
to
it
taste
was
more
of
the
same
piney
hops
mild
citrus
fruit
notes
and
somewhat
grainy
very
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
mild
carbonation
and
some
well
hidden
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
thick
and
pleasant
drinkability
was
great
an
easy
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
got
in
a
care
package
from
my
now
favorite
brotherinlaw
along
with
dreadnaught
and
expedition
stout
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
system
was
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
few
bits
of
yeast
floating
in
there
had
a
decent
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
film
with
good
lacing
the
smell
was
very
hoppy
and
citric
either
grapefruit
or
tangering
really
had
more
of
a
ipa
smell
than
an
apa
as
mentioned
in
other
reviews
definitely
set
the
table
for
what
to
expect
the
taste
was
also
really
good
and
more
along
an
ipa
than
apa
line
good
hops
good
citric
but
had
a
slightly
too
bitter
finish
for
me
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
recommend
trying
4
rb
t
y
personally
i
think
dreadnaught
kicks
this
ones
ass
in
taste
this
is
still
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
pale
ale
though
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
dark
ambercopper
color
with
a
minimal
tan
head
that
faded
slowly
leaving
a
bit
of
light
lace
the
aroma
is
something
to
behold
it
consisted
of
grapefruit
peach
and
roasted
malt
just
a
beautiful
big
citrusfloral
hop
experience
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
nice
hop
bitterness
balanced
out
by
the
roasted
malts
and
some
citrus
sweetness
the
beer
has
minimal
carbonation
with
a
medium
to
fullbody
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
a
must
try
from
three
floyds
pours
a
somewhat
murky
burnt
copper
with
a
very
generous
two
fingered
off
white
head
that
takes
a
good
while
to
die
down
to
a
nice
lacing
stickiness
is
very
good
stays
all
over
smell
has
alot
of
grapefuit
pine
and
floral
aromas
in
the
nose
extremely
crisp
odor
flavor
is
so
balanced
starts
off
with
the
grapefruit
then
the
pale
malt
comes
through
and
blances
it
out
so
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
so
clean
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
amazing
this
is
a
pale
ale
im
thinking
more
like
an
ipa
but
who
cares
about
labels
this
beer
is
amazing
d
this
truly
is
an
outstanding
tasting
apa
i
was
surprised
at
the
lackluster
appearance
but
maybe
that
was
a
fluke

overall
come
on
its
3
floyds
you
know
it
has
to
be
great
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
it
pushes
the
edge
for
ipas
it
has
enough
hops
to
push
it
on
the
verge
of
a
dipa
without
going
too
far
the
taste
is
wonderful
and
they
go
down
sooo
smootly
i
proclaim
this
beer
sessionable
and
great
great
drinkability
here
but
like
most
pale
ales
in
my
diet
these
days
a
couple
in
a
row
may
be
the
max
quite
decent
i
could
enjoy
23
of
these
before
the
taste
buds
need
a
break
from
being
worked
so
hard
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
17
bottles
one
day
but
for
now
this
will
do
just
fine
unfortunately
for
alpha
king
i
drank
this
right
after
i
had
my
first
bells
two
hearted
its
very
difficult
to
go
from
a
tremendous
ipa
like
that
to
a
pale
ale
since
i
love
the
hops
i
was
disappointed
in
the
taste
of
alpha
king
in
retrospect
it
was
probably
much
better
than
i
realized
and
actually
stood
up
well
for
being
an
apa
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
this
should
be
a
solid
offering
but
why
drink
pale
ales
when
you
can
drink
ipas
bright
and
refreshing
but
retaining
some
nice
body
with
natural
carbonation
a
great
pairing
with
fish
or
chicken
on
the
grill
this
summer
another
success
from
the
fine
folks
at
three
floyds
this
beer
is
really
good
i
wish
i
had
another
d
to
me
this
is
just
about
as
close
to
perfection
as
you
can
get
in
an
apa
perfectly
balance
between
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
this
is
so
good
it
should
be
illegal
the
best
part
of
the
fff
label
is
the
little
map
alpha
king
appears
rusty
copper
a
thin
cap
of
foam
quickly
dwindles
to
nothing
no
lacing
smell
is
floral
hops
and
some
sugary
malts
a
very
subtle
blend
taste
is
a
spicy
hop
blast
some
piney
ether
as
well
just
enough
sweetness
to
temper
the
hops
a
touch
of
full
sweetness
gets
cleaned
up
by
a
great
full
hop
blast
extremely
drinkable
refreshing
even
born
on
date
who
the
hell
knows
pours
out
a
cloudy
copper
with
minimal
head
some
soapy
lacing
smell
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
some
fading
hops
taste
quite
spritzy
which
surprised
me
given
the
lack
of
head
grassy
hops
with
a
soapy
aftertaste
malt
is
solid
tobacco
and
solid
caramel
flavours
its
quite
tasty
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
maybe
its
the
age
i
cant
imagine
i
have
a
bottle
at
its
peak
of
freshness
first
time
trying
so
i
risked
the
purchase
in
my
excitement
not
knowing
its
age
the
hops
are
there
just
in
weird
muted
kind
of
way
given
the
rep
of
fff
i
was
expecting
more
truthfully
pass
the
snpa
as
this
pale
ale
doesnt
match
the
benchmark
classic
american
pale
that
is
sierra
nevada
i
would
love
a
chance
to
try
fresh
on
tap
or
bottle
until
they
date
these
suckers
i
cant
cut
any
slack
d
i
think
it
is
very
tasty
hops
come
through
very
nice
but
it
doesnt
totally
cut
out
the
malt
body
overall
a
great
apa
that
is
almost
sessionable
bottle
poured
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
pale
orange
in
color
with
minimal
head
that
leaves
no
lace
on
the
glass
this
could
be
brought
on
because
the
glass
was
cold
as
hell
smell
is
wonderful
citrus
smelling
with
a
nice
grass
and
weed
in
there
reminds
me
of
being
in
the
mountains
in
spring
time
taste
is
very
amazing
with
a
nice
light
crip
bitterness
of
weed
citrus
fruits
maybe
a
not
ripe
honeybelle
simply
awesome
and
a
damn
fine
tasting
pale
ale
this
is
one
fine
offering
and
it
gets
better
each
and
every
time
i
drink
one
of
these
masterpieces
d
a
nice
quick
session
worthy
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
ever
to
non
hop
heads
because
i
dont
like
hops
for
the
sake
of
hops
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
another
thanks
goes
to
czoch75
for
a
sixer
that
was
included
in
a
trade
man
i
loved
this
via
bottle
but
ontap
this
shit
is
even
better
deep
orange
amber
in
color
with
slightly
more
clarity
than
the
bottled
version
the
freshness
from
drinking
it
at
the
3f
pub
took
this
over
the
top
for
me
even
via
bottle
this
has
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
cannot
be
denied
leaving
globs
of
lacing
even
after
the
beer
is
gone
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
nose
with
nice
rich
bready
malts
mixed
in
subtle
floral
and
pine
notes
as
well
along
with
some
caramel
and
honey
nice
amount
of
sweetness
at
the
front
and
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
clearing
it
out
leading
to
a
long
complex
crispbitter
finish
medium
in
body
this
beer
just
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
more
almost
drinks
like
a
dipa
but
at
6
you
can
have
several
of
these
this
is
a
musttry
beer
if
you
ever
have
the
misfortune
of
being
in
munster
go
get
this
stuff
fresh
and
when
youre
done
inhale
the
bouqet
left
behindan
absolute
grapefruit
bomb
remains
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
final
statement
this
is
hop
bomb
there
should
be
a
warning
on
the
label
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
its
a
delicious
apa
suitable
for
hop
heads
such
as
myself
id
love
to
have
regular
access
to
this
one
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
would
be
happy
to
have
this
one
as
a
regular
drinker
alpha
king
pale
ale
was
an
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
quite
a
bit
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
all
about
the
hops
fresh
and
fruity
citrus
hops
just
begging
to
be
tasted
the
taste
was
also
very
hoppy
and
delicious
with
a
good
malt
base
to
keep
some
balance
the
bitterness
was
not
as
intense
as
you
would
expect
with
all
of
the
hops
the
finish
was
dry
and
bitter
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
excellent
its
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
that
ive
tried
and
i
highly
recommend
it
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
i
broke
down
and
ordered
a
sixer
from
archer
liquors
in
chicago
very
cool
looking
bottle
with
the
king
himself
featured
on
the
front
the
beer
poured
a
dark
orange
with
a
very
good
head
the
smell
was
so
amazing
fresh
hops
permeated
my
nose
and
reminded
me
of
grass
herbs
and
flowers
the
taste
matched
up
very
nicely
with
hops
really
shining
through
wow
believe
the
hype
i
think
this
was
better
than
dreadnaught
this
probably
ties
with
deschutes
hop
trip
for
my
favorite
pale
ale
outstanding
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
to
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
with
ease
overall
its
a
great
beer
it
actually
seems
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
typical
apa
either
way
its
a
fantastic
beer
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
this
beer
easily
flows
down
the
throat
alpha
king
is
medium
bodied
and
feels
great
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
something
i
would
most
definitely
buy
again
that
is
if
i
can
ever
find
it
again
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
apas
ive
ever
had
feels
a
bit
thin
for
an
ipa
which
is
why
this
is
a
pa
good
drinking
wish
i
had
another
cool
label
drank
from
an
alesmith
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
amberish
color
with
a
thick
and
rocky
tan
head
looked
fairly
translucent
with
some
suspended
particles
great
smells
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
light
pineyness
as
well
smells
refreshing
and
very
clean
bready
malt
smell
thrown
in
too
bittering
hop
up
front
along
with
a
caramel
and
bready
taste
this
is
an
excellent
drinker
mouthfeel
on
lighter
side
and
bubbly
head
retained
until
the
end
of
the
glass
finished
with
just
enough
bitterness
drinkability
is
great
with
this
one
and
i
only
wish
i
could
find
it
local
for
9
a
sixer
like
some
people
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
into
a
pint
glass
big
2
finger
head
that
is
quite
luxurious
and
creamy
the
head
has
staying
power
too
and
leaves
some
insane
lacing
the
nose
is
heavy
on
pine
some
grapefruit
and
slight
flowery
note
very
balanced
flavor
hops
up
frontmalt
on
the
back
some
definite
citrus
in
between
really
nice
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
for
this
style
well
carbonated
refreshing
and
a
little
on
a
creamy
side
this
is
an
easy
drinkin
all
night
beer
i
could
easily
have
another
and
another
5
after
that
highly
recommended
the
body
is
an
almost
caramel
color
or
reddish
brown
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
to
create
a
cover
just
slightly
over
the
top
of
the
beer
leaving
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
hops
and
a
rather
large
malt
sweetness
which
is
basically
a
nondescript
fruity
flavor
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
nicely
big
citrus
hops
flavor
with
a
fruity
malt
backbone
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
that
gives
way
to
a
long
dry
finish
very
nice
beer
to
drink
could
be
a
little
thinner
for
the
style
giving
it
a
more
refreshing
hot
day
beer
character
overall
a
very
tasty
and
wellbalanced
brew
i
wish
i
could
buy
it
here
in
michigan
its
not
intensely
bitter
but
the
hops
are
very
prominent
this
beer
definately
blurs
the
line
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
very
murky
amber
colored
body
with
a
white
head
that
stood
for
a
while
there
were
flooties
in
the
beerim
assuming
they
where
yeast
citrusy
hop
smellhopsthis
is
a
hoppy
tasting
beer
but
there
is
somthing
blocking
the
hops
it
seems
like
there
shielded
slick
mouthful
and
very
easy
going
down
good
beer
but
lacing
somthing
i
thought
it
would
have
been
more
but
it
just
lacks
something
good
though
i
will
have
again
drinkability
the
ale
is
quite
drinkable
and
in
my
mind
a
restrained
version
of
dreadnaught
a
fantastically
hopped
american
pale
ale
with
the
smooth
mouthfeel
to
make
it
sessionable
12oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
hazy
amber
color
with
very
little
head
and
just
a
few
specks
of
lace
smells
mostly
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
fresh
bitter
hops
up
front
then
is
followed
by
a
bit
of
yeast
and
malts
towards
the
end
the
feel
is
light
to
medium
and
has
a
little
stickiness
to
it
this
brew
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
extra
yeast
they
put
in
the
bottle
d
tasty
and
easy
drinking
i
think
that
i
prefer
this
on
draft
but
either
way
this
makes
a
great
session
brew
in
all
honesty
i
drank
two
bottles
of
this
beer
during
the
course
of
the
review
because
it
is
just
that
good
i
really
hope
this
bottle
is
an
outlier
and
that
a
typical
bottle
of
this
isnt
as
flat
as
mine
because
it
brings
down
an
otherwise
tasty
beer
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
all
beers
deserve
a
second
chance
d
love
it
my
only
qualm
was
the
lack
of
quaffability
of
it
i
really
hate
to
buy
into
hype
but
damn
it
this
is
good
stuff
highly
recommended
d
this
is
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
has
been
my
goto
beer
for
yaers
but
this
one
is
less
bitter
and
has
a
much
more
complex
and
soothing
flavor
too
bad
ill
probably
never
see
this
beer
on
tap
in
california
let
alone
matching
the
overwhelming
availability
of
snpa
good
job
three
floyds
now
please
bring
it
to
missouri
so
i
can
help
out
the
environment
by
not
driving
to
illinois
to
purchase
this
beer
d
a
muscular
in
your
face
hoppy
pale
ale
if
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
i
would
say
it
was
an
ipa
that
being
said
it
grew
on
me
ill
get
it
again
when
i
am
back
in
ohio
too
bad
3f
does
not
get
out
to
massachusetts
very
good
ale
overall
definately
one
of
my
favorites
exceptional
beer
drink
one
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
bottom
line
this
pale
rocks
if
you
love
hops
i
think
its
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
but
i
love
it
in
spite
of
that
i
know
for
a
fact
i
would
buy
this
alll
the
time
if
i
could
poured
a
cloudy
burnt
amber
with
no
real
large
head
what
was
there
faded
quickly
but
left
a
film
of
gooey
drippy
lace
skimming
on
the
top
lots
of
eddys
and
swirls
rounding
about
on
it
deep
dripping
lace
down
the
glass
and
a
bit
of
a
bubble
stream
coming
up
from
the
bottom
smell
was
big
and
strong
big
citrus
players
here
lots
of
orange
and
grapefruit
very
sweet
smell
like
orange
sherbert
or
candy
very
nice
and
plesing
to
the
nose
smells
like
it
will
be
a
winner
taste
struck
me
as
odd
after
all
the
sugary
itrus
in
the
smell
none
really
came
through
in
the
taste
there
was
a
strong
bitter
hop
presence
providing
lots
of
ibus
however
it
was
more
of
a
pineresiney
type
of
hops
rather
then
the
sweet
candy
orange
that
came
through
at
first
nice
and
crisp
clean
very
dry
and
long
lingering
finish
leaving
a
taste
of
burntor
raosted
pine
for
several
minutes
after
a
sip
goes
down
very
smooth
and
clean
not
overally
carbonated
and
not
syrupy
either
a
nice
ipa
and
a
good
call
from
three
floyds
md
smooth
and
highly
palatable
with
a
manageable
bitterness
nice
mouthcoat
and
easy
down
carbonation
all
in
all
a
great
apa
probably
one
of
if
not
the
best
ive
had
to
date
d
very
fine
apa
with
interesting
herbalspicy
notes
in
the
taste
not
the
best
ive
had
but
it
is
very
good
thick
cloudy
orangebrown
color
with
a
big
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
smells
like
fruit
preserves
orange
juice
hops
herbs
caramel
tastes
like
herbal
tea
natural
fruit
juices
cherry
orange
grapefruit
peach
tons
of
hops
but
theyre
nicely
blended
with
bread
and
malt
flavors
this
is
complex
which
is
something
i
dont
normally
associate
with
the
style
robust
in
the
mouth
but
very
smooth
and
very
refreshing
this
could
be
guzzled
by
the
gallon
the
only
obstacle
being
the
abv
drinkability
near
perfect
and
thats
all
there
is
to
it
and
it
dont
taste
too
bad
neither
hoppy
as
hell
but
if
you
didnt
know
that
then
you
didnt
look
up
alpha
acids
on
wikipedia
before
you
bought
this
beer
and
youre
getting
what
you
deserve
it
tastes
like
citrus
grass
and
mounds
of
bittering
hops
yes
its
another
americanstyle
hop
bomb
but
three
floyds
has
taken
a
singleminded
style
and
just
nailed
it
completely
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
strong
carbonation
that
complements
the
hop
profile
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
bunch
of
these
hell
i
just
did
poured
into
a
flute
amber
with
orange
and
red
hues
large
head
rose
and
fell
slowly
small
bubbled
head
fell
and
left
lacing
on
the
sides
i
smell
oranges
and
grapefruits
definate
c
hops
same
taste
as
aroma
hits
you
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
adds
to
a
very
satisfying
complexity
tastes
somewhere
between
an
ipa
and
a
pale
ale
enjoyed
it

and
i
couldnt
pass
it
up

dubious
light

the
smell
was

there
was
a
touch
of

in

as
well
the
taste
was
bitter
hops
and
some
citrusy
hops
balanced
by
a
good

the

both

this

too
hoppy
to

it

it
does

really
noticeable
in

a

barely
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick

quite

very

probably
just
a

the

after
a

minutes
this
smells
hoppy

sweet
and
smoothat
first
but
is
followed
by
a
hoppy
bite
this
tastes
good
and
not
overly
hoppy
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
want
too
many
at
once
though
this
is
certainly
something
to
try
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
there
was
a
great
amount
of
lace
present
on
the
glass
throughout
smells
somewhat
grassy
and
herbal
along
with
citrusy
taste
is
sweet
upfront
then
with
an
intense
bitterness
citrusy
bitterness
very
sticky
wonderful
good
mouthfeel
this
may
not
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
for
a
session
but
it
sure
did
hit
the
spot
when
i
am
looking
for
some
hops
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
to
me
it
almost
seems
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
plae
but
whatever
it
is
dont
pass
this
one
up
the
thing
is
i
remember
this
being
even
better
on
tap
the
freshness
was
overwhelming
to
me
at
the
time
i
will
have
to
rereview
once
i
get
this
on
tap
again
amber

with
a
little
lingering
head
and
nice

smell

taste
is
a

blend
of
hops
and
malts
notes
of
citrus
bitter
hoppiness
that
doesnt
take
over
the
beer
but
works
very
well
sweet
clean
taste
that
leaves
a
crisp
aftertaste
of
citrus
hops
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
adores
hops
excellent
pale
ale
thanks
to
jahnoth
for
the
trade
this
poured
a
murky
auburn
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
quite
a
while
ring
lacing
was
there
until
the
last
dram
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
surprising
as
thats
where
i
sense
the
first
inkling
of
the
nice
malt
going
on
here
the
nose
is
all
about
grapefruit
tangerine
and
spruce
halfway
through
it
still
looks
like
southern
iced
tea
in
an
oldtimey
pitcher
the
taste
is
memorable
ive
forgotten
how
long
its
been
since
ive
had
such
a
perfect
blend
of
subdued
sweet
caramel
taste
teased
by
such
a
wonderful
sour
grapefruit
and
bitter
mandarin
orange
hop
balance
this
one
seems
like
a
happy
marriage
of
an
excellent
north
american
esb
with
a
westcoast
double
ipa
extraordinary
pours
an
amber
color
quite
clear
except
for
a
few
large
floaties
forms
a
thin
beige
head
that
does
not
stick
around
too
long
an
immediate
aroma
of
american
hops
wafts
from
my
glass
notes
of
lychee
grapefruit
other
citrus
fruits
are
in
the
nose
it
smells
slightly
sweet
nectar
like
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
here
as
well
ooh
quite
bitter
this
beer
finishes
with
a
drying
intense
bitterness
overall
this
beer
is
only
slightly
sweet
it
has
a
light
body
is
focused
entirely
on
the
hop
component
the
hops
are
over
the
top
but
perhaps
it
is
missing
some
hop
flavor
there
is
lots
of
bitterness
but
it
feels
like
it
is
missing
some
balancing
hop
nectar
flavor
underlying
the
hop
attack
there
seems
to
be
some
nuttiness
as
well
as
some
caramel
notes
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hop
attack
not
much
malt
here
so
if
you
dont
like
hops
stay
away
luckily
i
do
like
hops
so
this
beer
is
just
fine
perhaps
a
bit
too
unbalanced
for
an
everyday
drinking
beer
but
every
once
in
a
while
is
nice
i
was
extremely
impressed
with
this
pale
ale
i
like
the
idea
of
dropping
the
india
moniker
the
nose
is
great
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
coupled
with
a
sweet
malt
profile
the
head
is
white
and
thin
but
leaves
a
decent
lacing
the
color
is
orange
with
lots
of
red
highlights
the
taste
is
extremely
balanced
the
hops
are
quite
present
but
they
seem
to
be
just
right
this
isnt
an
imperial
ipa
just
a
wellhopped
pale
ale
there
are
some
grapefruit
notes
alongside
some
hints
of
pine
these
are
balanced
by
a
taste
of
toast
or
a
biscuit
flavor
that
balances
the
hops
very
well
the
abv
is
warming
as
you
move
through
the
beer
the
finish
is
very
clean
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
the
aroma
is
slightly
grassy
slightly
citrusy
but
not
overbearing
the
taste
is
a
very
satisfying
mixture
of
bucolic
malt
flavors
very
traditional
british
tasting
combined
with
the
nice
firmness
of
the
hop
flavor
it
makes
for
a
great
beer
its
a
tad
high
in
abv
for
a
pale
but
you
dont
sense
this
when
drinking
and
its
very
drinkable
fairly
easy
to
drink
you
gotta
try
this
one
even
if
you
dont
consider
yourself
a
hophead
clear
copperamber
in
color
with
a
good
frothy
head
that
dissipates
very
slowly
huge
grapefuity
aroma
that
i
think
has
some
pine
notes
i
have
a
hard
time
distinguishing
pine
notes
medium
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
the
everpresent
malt
backbone
which
is
most
noticeable
at
the
start
is
pretty
overshadowed
by
hops
after
midswallow
the
finish
is
citrusy
and
grapefuity
with
an
aftertaste
that
lasts
for
a
long
while
as
a
pale
ale
i
think
ive
had
some
ipas
with
less
hops
than
alpha
king
nonetheless
its
a
great
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
and
very
well
balanced
this
one
would
make
for
a
nice
session
brew
alpha
king
almost
reminds
me
of
a
very
mild
dreadnaught
medium
body
soft
mouthfeel
and
tingly
carbonation
i
could
and
have
drink
this
beer
all
night
i
highly
recommend
this
one
ive
had
it
bottled
as
well
as
on
tap
if
youre
ever
out
one
night
and
see
this
on
tap
yeah
order
it
up
all
in
all
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
huge
white
head
which
leaves
trails
all
along
the
glass
a
nice
chewy
almost
toasty
malt
attempts
to
hold
its
own
against
citrus
hop
attack
hop
profile
is
wonderful
the
flavors
make
mouth
happy
this
is
an
incredible
beer
which
i
wish
were
available
in
vermont
or
even
new
england
at
large
alpha
king
does
seem
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
true
pale
ale
i
could
definitely
make
this
a
regular
in
my
rotation
if
it
was
more
available
i
plan
to
pick
up
a
couple
of
fresh
sixers
at
the
brewery
next
week
imho
alpha
king
sets
the
standard
for
american
pale
ales
burnt
copper
with
a
foamy
white
head
which
recedes
yet
remains
ever
present
spectacular
lacing
pungent
grapefruit
aroma
carbonation
is
a
perfect
level
silky
smooth
lightly
sweet
fruity
malts
hold
up
to
a
powerful
hoppiness
that
is
never
too
bitter
highly
drinkable
this
was
the
beer
that
got
me
started
years
back
and
i
will
always
have
a
special
place
for
it
in
my
heart
love
it
served
from
a
12oz
bottle
from
a
6
pack
i
picked
up
in
indy
a
few
weeks
ago
ive
been
dying
to
try
some
of
the
3
floyds
beers
and
i
have
not
been
disappointed
in
the
least
the
alpha
king
pours
out
a
subdued
orangelight
copper
color
topped
with
a
healthy
head
thats
just
a
bit
off
white
the
carbonation
in
my
alpha
king
was
very
present
not
lacking
at
all
as
i
have
heard
some
say
in
the
past
aroma
is
a
curious
blend
of
grapefruit
citrus
and
pine
resiny
hops
with
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
malt
creeping
in
taste
is
very
boldly
hoppy
but
surprisingly
malty
as
well
much
more
balanced
than
i
expected
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
blends
well
into
a
caramely
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
piney
hop
flavor
is
left
of
the
back
of
your
tongue
with
the
nice
crisp
finish
very
drinkable
ipa
well
crafted
wow
this
really
took
me
by
surprise
i
was
picking
up
a
barrel
of
brooklyn
lager
for
thanksgiving
and
i
decided
to
get
something
for
myself
to
cover
the
few
days
before
i
grabbed
an
expensive
6
of
victory
storm
king
and
this
because
i
remembered
the
three
floyds
name
damn
this
is
great
beer
pale
ale
my
ass
maybe
because
most
others
pale
in
comparison
the
appearance
was
a
burnt
amber
color
with
a
nice
deep
tan
head
lacing
throughout
the
entire
pint
all
the
way
down
the
smell
was
floral
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
good
things
to
come
bam
the
taste
just
smacked
me
in
the
face
flowers
a
little
grassy
but
very
bright
with
a
serious
bite
im
writing
this
after
my
second
bottle
if
i
start
the
review
the
same
sitting
or
day
i
can
tell
its
a
winner
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
crisp
with
a
slight
citrus
twang
but
definitely
not
that
syrupy
taste
that
sometimes
lingers
this
lingered
on
for
a
good
long
while
some
of
the
maltiness
crept
back
in
on
the
tale
end
i
believe
this
is
very
drinkable
because
ive
already
decided
to
start
my
2
beer
a
weekday
limit
tomorrow
this
is
right
up
there
with
hop
devil
i
know
ipa
category
but
similar
in
character
i
will
ab
these
one
of
these
days
drinkability
a
great
beer
hoppier
than
most
pale
ales
but
who
cares
a
staple
in
my
fridge
seek
this
one
out
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
didnt
kick
me
out
of
my
shoes
but
it
is
good
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
imho
with
a
decent
punch
to
it
ah
the
firstborn
child
of
nick
cos
not
normal
brewing
philosophy
its
almost
damning
with
faint
praise
not
to
call
it
an
ipa
in
which
case
itd
rate
second
to
3fs
own
dreadnaught
at
our
homebrew
club
meeting
at
the
brewery
it
felt
as
though
we
were
swimming
on
the
uss
entire
hop
production
for
the
year
tangy
citrus
hop
flavor
will
give
you
a
buzz
long
before
the
alcohol
can
work
its
magic
an
inspiration
to
every
amateur
or
pro
brewer
to
go
big
or
go
home
i
have
no
idea
why
the
bottle
was
so
full
and
the
carbonation
so
low
but
alpha
king
is
an
old
favorite
and
highly
recommended
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
by
flavor
alcohol
content
and
mouthfeel
i
could
throw
this
down
easy
yet
it
is
good
enough
to
be
slowly
savored
a
toned
down
little
cousin
of
the
vaunted
dreadnaught
just
a
decent
all
around
pale
ale
deep
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
smell
was
judiciously
garnished
with
piney
hops
as
if
the
brewers
merely
dropped
dripping
hop
cones
into
the
boil
to
me
it
was
a
somewhat
raw
unrefined
smell
that
was
not
balanced
exceptionally
well
by
any
malts
taste
was
very
true
to
style
with
more
hops
although
a
tad
on
the
citrus
side
in
the
taste
with
a
cracker
like
malt
taste
and
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
punch
much
more
alcoholic
than
expected
for
a
pale
ale
so
this
is
not
what
you
would
call
a
session
beer
but
a
nice
way
to
mix
things
up
and
kick
your
taste
buds
around
a
bit
the
unrefined
hops
make
it
something
to
drink
towards
the
end
of
the
night
when
you
are
ready
to
not
taste
anything
else
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
bronze
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
hints
at
pineapple
and
grapefruit
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
as
well
a
very
full
smell
the
taste
starts
a
little
sweet
and
malty
but
ends
with
a
fury
of
hops
this
brew
reminds
me
of
burning
river
because
both
are
pale
ales
that
have
lots
of
ipa
characteristics
the
body
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
for
a
pale
ale
the
drinkability
is
really
good
for
a
7
25
brew
a
fantastic
pale
that
works
anytime
appearance
pours
a
copper
amber
tone
with
a
nice
sized
off
white
cream
hued
head
leaves
nice
appeasing
rings
of
lacing
not
bad
at
all
aroma
first
thing
that
hits
me
is
the
grapefruit
like
citrus
hop
tone
with
a
rich
malty
barley
presence
this
beer
is
a
big
pale
ale
at
about
7abv
i
think
this
one
smells
absolutely
wonderful
taste
rich
balance
between
the
full
hop
bitterness
some
pine
cone
like
and
earthy
tones
available
to
the
palate
the
juicy
robust
malt
backbone
also
is
here
teasing
the
taste
buds
just
so
good
mouthfeel
medium
body
not
sticky
but
texture
just
enough
to
let
the
sweet
maltiness
and
hop
oils
run
across
the
palate
with
some
consistency
drinkability
freaking
amazin
so
damn
drinkable
perfect
with
a
sixer
and
a
ball
game
on
the
tube
just
one
of
those
beers
i
personally
love
the
dreadnaught
but
this
is
so
damn
good
and
palatable
for
a
flagship
beer
they
better
never
touch
the
recipe
tawnygolden
brown
hue
slightly
offwhite
head
about
a
finger
in
size
the
head
lasted
for
a
moment
faded
to
a
tight
cap
that
lasted
throughout
consumption
laced
very
well
damn
lovely
nose
hoppy
acidic
bold
grapefruit
hints
of
pine
very
distant
caramel
malt
powerful
this
is
the
alpha
king
of
all
pale
ales
the
bitterness
is
not
as
assertive
as
the
bouquet
would
indicate
it
is
might
tasty
though
oh
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
bitter
the
maltiness
plays
more
that
a
secondary
roll
id
say
the
relationship
of
malt
and
hops
is
4060
yes
the
hops
steal
the
show
grapefruit
rinds
acidic
zesty
vaguely
piney
flowery
too
savor
this
one
its
hoppy
enjoyment
and
complexities
only
seem
to
grow
better
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
helps
produce
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
so
easy
to
drink
youd
never
realize
how
high
the
abv
is
i
snagged
a
sixpack
in
des
moines
now
i
wish
i
bought
more
recommended
a
stuporous
deep
copper
color
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
adorned
by
a
massive
and
semicreamy
off
white
head
and
after
dissipating
the
resultant
lace
a
velum
like
sheet
conceals
the
glass
perfectly
the
hops
produce
a
marvelous
floral
aroma
at
the
front
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
fresh
crisp
ending
to
the
nose
with
a
semisweet
malt
start
and
the
middle
a
moderate
feel
on
the
taste
buds
finish
is
lenient
in
acidity
with
the
hops
dynamic
in
their
spiciness
wow
they
make
your
whole
sensory
system
sit
up
and
take
notice
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
ranks
in
my
top
ten
all
time
favorite
pale
ale
category
need
to
get
another
order
in
for
this
magnificent
beer
hazy
orangebrown
body
almost
iced
tealike
topped
by
a
sticky
chunky
head
no
missing
the
big
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
mild
but
noticeable
hints
of
banana
esters
im
not
talking
about
hefeweizen
but
theyre
there
great
hop
taste
and
bitterness
which
is
kinda
implied
by
a
name
like
alpha
king
usually
with
a
hopping
like
this
one
would
expect
to
find
a
sticky
malt
body
but
remember
this
is
a
pale
ale
not
an
ipa
the
malt
provides
precarious
balance
to
the
big
hop
flavor
and
assertive
bitterness
the
hop
flavor
is
rather
complex
and
changes
throughout
the
mouthfuls
there
is
a
little
apple
late
in
the
finish
looking
back
on
this
brew
it
seems
like
this
is
about
as
close
to
a
big
homebrewed
pa
as
you
are
going
to
find
out
there
with
the
hops
haze
and
esters
this
is
one
beer
i
wish
would
come
to
the
garden
state
12oz
bottle
fresh
from
the
brewery
beautiful
copper
colored
ale
with
a
thick
frothy
head
big
piney
citrusy
hoppy
aroma
which
smells
like
a
good
amount
of
cascade
but
i
could
be
wrong
none
the
less
fantasticly
hopped
smooth
body
with
a
bitter
slightly
dry
finish
terrific
flavor
with
nice
blend
of
malts
and
hops
a
bitter
pale
but
fantastic
and
nearly
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
delicate
lacing
wish
i
had
more
of
this
ohhh
me
gusta
esta
cervesa
its
very
good
the
nose
and
taste
screams
hops
hops
hops
malt
malt
malt
in
that
order
huge
grapefruit
bitterness
that
the
malt
attempts
to
balance
but
has
a
hard
time
doing
so
however
it
has
a
nice
maltiness
that
isnt
lost
to
the
hops
the
head
was
a
bit
small
and
the
carbonation
was
low
but
i
think
this
was
good
as
an
overcarbonated
hoppy
beer
tends
to
burn
ones
tongue
pretty
good
lightly
turbid
dark
copper
hue
topped
by
a
solid
stiff
cream
white
head
that
leaves
steadfast
belgian
lace
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
pronounced
pink
grapefruit
with
sprinkled
with
hints
of
acidic
lemon
zest
overshadowed
non
descript
light
lovibond
caramel
malt
tapers
the
pungency
slightly
and
couples
with
understated
hints
of
pine
to
lend
a
sweet
sappy
spruce
counterpart
to
the
dominant
citrus
character
obviously
hop
driven
and
very
welcoming
aromawise
brusque
snap
of
simple
caramel
sweetness
initially
in
flavor
is
nearly
overrun
by
a
barbed
yet
agreeable
melange
of
grapefruit
flesh
and
barely
burnt
biscuit
a
suggestion
of
candied
lemon
surfaces
mid
palate
along
with
rounding
hints
of
toffee
and
manages
to
facilitate
a
lingering
rich
nearly
balancing
malt
presence
a
balmy
grassy
dry
hop
derived
component
surfaces
late
and
extends
the
lemony
citrus
theme
in
a
fresh
lemongrass
like
nature
a
bit
skimpy
in
body
to
support
the
pervasive
hop
character
but
certainly
passably
dextrinous
in
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
deceptively
light
and
balanced
mix
of
clean
hop
bitterness
and
stately
caramel
sweetness
alpha
king
is
a
unique
and
highly
enjoyable
american
brew
its
overall
flavor
profile
precariously
teeters
between
an
american
pale
and
a
northwest
ipa
but
manages
to
find
balance
the
quintessential
sugared
grapeftuit
impression
is
there
but
never
becomes
cloying
reminescent
of
a
hop
ottin
liberty
ale
hybrid
superlatively
drinkable
and
ominously
so
at
that
medium
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
hoppy
and
malty
a
medium
bodied
pale
ale
nice
citrusy
floral
hops
balanced
by
sweet
crystal
malts
great
malt
and
hops
flavors
that
are
different
and
distinct
yet
still
well
balanced
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
kind
of
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
very
nice
beer
this
one
pours
out
a
copper
color
with
a
good
sized
slightlylessthanwhite
head
on
top
great
lace
trail
one
wiff
of
this
gardenlike
beer
will
smack
you
with
hops
with
a
touch
of
ginger
scent
in
there
as
for
the
taste
it
is
completly
dominated
by
a
kick
of
hops
spicy
hops
not
much
else
to
say
except
that
if
you
like
hops
this
is
a
good
one
to
seek
out
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
and
little
lacing
on
the
glass
tons
of
floaty
stuff
in
the
glass
almost
scary
how
much
there
is
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
grassy
and
citrus
smell
the
flavor
was
mostly
hops
with
some
grass
and
citrus
tastes
thrown
in
just
like
in
the
aroma
the
finish
is
you
guessed
it
hops
not
a
bad
beer
not
the
easiest
drink
but
i
may
have
another
sometime
down
the
road
that
massive
whack
of
hops
is
what
gets
you
yeah
the
body
is
really
good
heck
7
3
percent
alcohol
and
alcohol
never
shows
up
in
the
taste
profile
its
bitter
but
not
massively
so
and
while
others
have
noted
some
sweetness
i
never
noticed
it
give
me
this
over
arrogant
bastard
any
day
im
impressed
with
this
beer
as
much
as
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
like
it
hop
heads
rejoice
this
one
will
dominate
you
and
make
you
beg
for
more
of
those
delicious
flowering
cones
hops
hops
and
more
hops
are
in
the
aroma
predominate
in
the
taste
and
are
present
in
the
finish
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
you
may
expect
very
smooth
and
luxurious
mouthfeel
i
love
this
beer
i
dare
say
on
par
with
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
and
then
some
recommended
this
beer
poured
amberorange
colored
that
was
clear
and
well
carbonated
it
created
a
creamy
beige
colored
foam
that
lasted
the
whole
way
to
the
last
sip
and
more
the
consistency
of
the
foam
was
watery
as
it
moved
fairly
well
thick
sticky
and
creamy
it
created
a
sheet
like
lace
on
the
sides
to
about
way
down
the
glass
then
slowly
broke
into
a
spotted
lace
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aromas
were
dominated
by
hops
fresh
just
harvested
then
aromas
of
grass
citrus
grapefruit
pine
trees
and
sap
and
some
malt
soon
began
to
mix
in
to
the
nose
of
the
beer
the
flavors
that
rolled
over
my
tongue
were
also
dominated
by
hops
tastes
of
dry
hops
fresh
hops
pine
needles
floral
hops
fresh
grass
citrus
fruit
grapefruit
and
some
malt
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
was
mainly
of
hops
some
citrus
some
fresh
with
malt
tones
but
light
semi
dry
appeal
and
not
overly
bitter
the
body
was
on
the
light
to
medium
side
i
did
notice
that
as
i
came
to
the
finish
and
the
beer
was
allowed
to
warm
it
became
thicker
and
the
malt
flavors
seemed
to
become
more
pronounced
this
is
a
really
good
pale
ale
good
flavors
and
very
pleasing
to
the
senses
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
brewed
in

perhaps
my
experience
with
this
pale
ale
was
the
result
of
perfect
lining
up
of
the
planets
but
i
cant
remember
drinking
a
better
tasting
pale
ale
in
a
long
time
originally
sampled
on
5
october
2002
alpha
king
has
a
beautiful
citrus
hop
aroma
along
with
a
nice
bitter
taste
w
a
clean
finish
it
is
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
apa
in
my
opinion
its
a
very
good
session
beer
id
rather
have
dreadnaught
but
if
you
want
to
drink
a
few
this
is
a
better
choice
update
i
believe
three
floyds
has
given
up
having
schell
bottle
their
beer
i
like
the
new
batch
better
the
head
is
stronger
and
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
balanced
i
wish
they
would
send
their
strong
beers
to
iowa
a
top
shelf
brewer
well
this
sure
is
one
great
looking
beer
the
head
came
up
three
full
fingers
and
lingered
like
crazy
creating
super
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
the
body
is
crystal
clear
dark
amber
topped
by
the
ivory
head
mentioned
above
great
nose
that
gives
off
plenty
of
hops
aromas
and
hints
of
the
malt
body
the
taste
is
about
hops
citrusy
and
floral
in
the
main
with
great
rind
and
grapefruit
accents
plenty
of
great
bitterness
it
lingers
on
the
palate
like
some
great
oily
lotion
to
leave
a
creamy
sense
to
remind
you
of
the
great
taste
youve
just
experienced
full
body
and
ultra
creamy
feel
make
this
an
exceptionally
fine
flavorfest
i
will
be
finding
another
of
these
and
revisiting
this
beer
pours
a
dark
coppery
color
nice
foamy
white
head
lacing
on
glass
as
head
dissipates
lacing
persists
as
beer
is
consumed
as
does
a
very
thin
head
a
very
attractive
beer
smells
of
citrus
and
hops
not
overpowering
but
very
pleasant
decent
taste
hoppy
with
a
citrus
overtone
a
nice
feel
not
very
heavy
readily
drunk
a
good
overall
beer
this
bees
is
defiantly
the
king
of
pale
ales
in
my
book
the
wonderful
golden
copper
color
and
thick
creamy
head
delighted
me
at
the
start
the
smell
was
rich
and
floral
from
perfect
dry
hopping
the
taste
was
excellent
a
complex
blend
of
grains
balanced
with
hoppy
floral
esters
and
bitterness
balanced
this
beer
beautifully
starts
out
smooth
and
sweet
becoming
bitter
and
piney
with
a
citrus
middle
and
a
tart
floral
finish
hail
the
king
tasted
this
beer
at
the
blind
tigers
three
floyds
event
cheers
to
mjr
for
the
blockbuster
pours
with
an
amber
color
grapefruit
comes
through
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
as
well
its
labeled
a
pale
ale
but
i
might
go
as
far
as
to
call
it
an
ipa
its
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
wonderful
hop
character
i
hope
i
find
more
of
it
around
here
a
very
good
ipa
this
is
very
nice
from
the
pour
a
good
copper
color
from
the
outset
a
nice
head
that
fades
to
a
lace
after
a
while
a
great
aroma
of
hops
and
some
spice
this
beer
offers
a
great
flavor
from
the
first
sip
to
the
very
last
the
hops
are
so
wellutilized
this
is
a
solid
ipa
prost
i
ordered
this
beer
at
restaurant
a
couple
nights
ago
already
knowing
that
it
received
high
ratings
but
i
had
no
clue
that
it
was
going
to
be
this
dang
good
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
thick
rocky
white
head
the
head
retains
itself
for
the
entire
duration
leaving
a
thin
lace
splattered
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
about
hops
lots
and
lots
of
hops
light
citrus
aromas
where
also
detected
the
tastenuthin
but
hops
it
seemed
as
though
i
tasted
a
different
type
of
hops
each
time
i
took
a
drink
but
wheres
the
7
3
alcohol
its
hidden
exceptionally
well
there
was
an
intense
amount
of
bitterness
left
in
my
mouth
but
i
didnt
mind
i
was
in
love
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
will
i
buy
this
one
again
hell
yeah
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
the
smell
is
sweet
maltiness
with
citrus
notes
the
taste
has
a
malty
start
finishing
with
grapefruit
hops
overall
a
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
that
seems
to
hide
its
relatively
hight
alcohol
percentage
well
drinkability
very
very
easy
to
drink
the
blend
of
the
flavors
coupled
with
the
dryness
on
the
tongue
make
for
an
excellent
beer
cheers
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
ale
they
call
this
an
ipa
cant
wait
to
try
three
floyds
ipa
if
this
is
the
pale
ale
from
alpha
king

i
would
dearly
love
to
try
their
i
p
a
my
first
caskconditioned
beer
the
head
was
large
and
fluffy
and
the
aroma
was
strong
of
citrus
and
fruits
the
balance
was
amazing
a
sweet
malty
mouthfeel
among
the
strong
citrus
hoppy
domination
the
hop
flavor
sticks
around
past
the
very
dry
and
crisp
finish
what
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
with
such
a
dry
and
crisp
finish
is
that
a
trait
of
caskconditioned
not
the
slightest
hint
of
the
7
3
abv
at
all
this
beer
just
came
damn
close
to
two
hearted
ale
as
my
favorite
pale
ale
the
labeling
on
the
sixpack
caught
my
with
the
crazy
looking
king

it
to
begin
withpoured

in

dark

citrus

smell
and
a
really

the

is

and
a

the
hop
flavor
stays
on
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
i
like
hoppy

and
the

is
a
nice
bonus

the

you
have
to
be
kidding
me
not
even
the
least
bit
noticable
in
taste
highly
drinkable
but
watch
out
or
this
will
hit
you
like
a
hammer
to
the
head
a
great
pale

drinkability
very
high
the
incredible
balance
and
dryness
combine
to
make
a
very
drinkable
beer
start
a
big

with
this

holy

what
a

huge
citrus

leading
to
a
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
wellbodied
ale
the
intense
spicy

profile
is
awesome
with
an
aggressive
but
not
oppressive
bitter
bite
up
onnear
the
top
of
the
line
bottle
numbered
02142
which
i
presume
means
the
142nd
day
of
2002
does
anyone
know
if
i
am
right
says
brewed
in
new

cokes
tells
me
its
contract
brewed
by

despite
being
6
months
old
still
in
fine
shape
spooky

excellent

sensationally
fruity
aroma
taste
is
quite
good
rich
caramel
malts
buttressed
by
grapefruit
hops
instead
of
bittering
the

bolster
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
interesting
effect
kind
of
like
sierra

pale

crossed
with
magic
hat

but
sweeter
than
both
those
beers
topnotch
mouthfeel
creamy
frothy
and
just
a
hint
of
rawness
this
should
appeal
to
not
only
the
hophead
but
the
fruit
beer
fan
as
well
as
middle
of
the
road
drinkers
looking
for
adventure
a
fun
beer
to
drink
but
too
fruity
and
zesty
to
be
a
session
pick
7
3
is
that
for
real
yikes
three
floyds
is
new
to
me
and
definitely
one
i
will
keep
my
eye
on
god
bless
this
current
wave
of
intrepid
new
us
microbrewers
i
was
born
at
the
right
time
i
must
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
pours
to
an
amberorangish
color
with
an
offwhite
creamy
head
it
also
has
a
slight
hazy
appearance
to
it
alpha
king
has
a
very
hoppy
citrusy
nose
probably
from
the
possible
use
of
cascade
hops
the
citrus
aroma
reminds
me
of
lemon
zest
the
beer
has
a
nice
hoppy
citrus
flavor
as
well
and
finishes
dry
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
when
i
want
a
nice
hoppy
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
pale
average
appearance
not
alot
stands
out
there
is
an
above
average
hop
presence
but
it
seems
to
fade
into
thin
air
as
you
drink
slight
white
head
overall
a
slightly
above
average
pale
ale
nose
of
citrus
and
spruce
over
a
hint
of
malt
the
flavor
it
starts
out
ok
but
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
a
medicinal
herbal
note
kicks
in
that
i
cant
get
my
tastebuds
around
i
found
it
slightly
offputting
but
can
appreicate
that
it
makes
it
different
from
other
apas
out
there
decent
balance
otherwise
good
bit
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
or
second
choice
the
appearance
isnt
too
much
color
of
one
of
the
lighter
shades
of
leather
with
an
offwhite
head
that
was
neither
large
nor
long
lasting
nose
is
malty
with
hops
that
are
dominated
by
the
christmas
treelike
over
the
citrus
but
both
are
present
flavor
is
surprisingly
thick
malt
for
a
pale
beer
with
a
nice
balance
with
the
hops
kind
of
a
slick
mouthfeel
but
not
as
slimy
as
some
a
fresh
one
you
might
also
be
blown
away
as
a
hoosier
ive
got
to
give
it
up
for
my
favorite
beer
brewed
in
indiana
this
pours
a
deep
copperorange
color
smells
of
citrus
and
floral
aspects
has
a
huge
hop
flavor
lots
of
cascades
i
presume
and
should
qualify
as
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
however
this
is
a
three
floyds
brew
and
as
they
say
were
not
normal
regardless
this
is
a
great
ale
cant
believe
this
is
brewed
and
bottled
at
schell
in
new
ulm
what
a
serious
and
bold
beer
cloudy
hazy
burnt
orange
color
nice

that
sticks
hops
explosion
in

nose
a
citric
dynamite
blast
tastes
awesome
bitter
alpha
hop
madness
in
the
mouth
is
meakly
balanced
by
a
caramel
malt
body
it
is
slightly
thin
in
mouthfeel
but
the
hop
party
doesnt
let
you
worry
about
that
hits
the
spot
after
a
hot
day
in
the
sun

this

that
left
some
nice

a
slight

it
the
flavor
had
hops
and
malt
with
a
sweet

not

sweet

caramel
taste
it
has
a
medium
body
and
finish
not
as
dry
of
a

as
their
pride
and
joy

a
good
beer

strong

you
all
the

of
mine

with
a
nice

on

there

a

grapefruit
highly

i
can
not
detect
the

abv
overall
and
enjoyable
pale

i
think
this
brew
leans
more
to
being
an

a
pale

even
more
beautiful
than

one

pale

seems
more
in

with
an

if
you
ask
me

changing
to

and
long

a
very
satisfying
beer
to
the
hophead
and
nonhophead
i
would
hope
very
good
without
being
heavybodied
well
made
n
b
wow
according
to
other
reviews
this
is
big
in
alcohol
but
youd
not
know
it
man
what
a
good
beer
a
nicely
hopped
apa
not
an
ipa
that
pours
out
to
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
slight
head
initial
taste
of
citrus
and
caramel
with
a
big
dose
of
hops
on
the
finish
this
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevadas
pale
with
a
heavier
dose
of
hops
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
does
the
american
pale
ale
style
proud
i
am
definitely
happy
that
i
went
and
bought
this
beer
pours
a
pale
orangeyamber
color
with
a
nice
head
on
it
and
a
clinging
lace
floral
hops
and
yeast
in
the
nose
this
beer
starts
off
all
hops
but
as
i
keep
sipping
it
i
get
more
and
more
malt
that
really
balances
this
brew
very
nicely
lots
of
bready
yeast
flavor
as
well
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
kick
ass
beer
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
of
it
nice
amber
color
good
head
that
left
some
lace
on
the
glass
too
much
yeast
floating
around
the
yeast
didnt
bother
me
while
drinking
but
it
wasnt
a
very
appetising
sp
sight
grapefruit
and
floral
hops
dominate
the
ohsowonderful
aroma
pretty
damn
hoppy
for
an
apa
really
closer
to
ipa
wonderful
bitterness
in
this
beer
its
a
must
for
hopheads
nice
thick
mouthfeel
this
ale
truly
is
meat
drink
and
cloth
its
all
one
needs
in
life
at
7
abv
this
is
a
pretty
damn
drinkable
beer
hazy
orange
tinted
amber
color
frothy
white
head
a
bit
of
a
pungent
hop
scent
an
oily
hop
taste
present
quite
bitter
more
like
an
ipa
though
an
average
pale
ale
tastes
more
like
a
britishstyle
pale
ale
to
me
american
styles
have
more
of
a
floral
and
herbal
aroma
reminiscent
of
the
nw
hop
varieties
to
me
this
one
doesnt
possess
that
characteristic
i
see
im
not
in
agreement
with
most
on
this
beer
but
sn
summit
and
big
sky
are
a
lot
better
in
my
opinion
ahhh
now
this
is
what
an
apa
is
supposed
to
be
golden
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
floral
aroma
and
knockyouonyourass
grapefruity
hoppiness
delightful
now
i
am
a
huge
sierra
nevada
fan
but
this
definitely
tops
their
pale
ale
nicely
done
as
someone
who
loves
american
hop
flavor
but
thinks
that
lemon
tones
in
wheat
beers
are
sour
i
was
a
little
worried
that
the
label
was
in
tropical
colors
and
promised
citrus
one
short
sip
later
my
fears
were
allayed
were
talking
grapefruit
hops
this
is
a
truly
good
american
pale
and
i
can
echo
the
grapefruit
comments
of
venom
and
others
yes
better
than
sierra
nevada
to
me
only
the
similar
but
even
more
hopped
summit
extra
pale
is
a
better
example
of
this
style
in
my
opinion
certainly
smokes
more
wellknown
apa
examples
like
sierra
nevada
pick
some
up
you
will
not
be
disappointed
nice
herbal
nose
and
fruity
malt
palate
especially
towards
the
back
where
some
real
juicy
flavors
come
through
hop
flavor
is
mellow
but
the
bitterness
is
solid
not
the
cleanest
pale
ale
but
its
really
well
rounded
and
has
a
deliciously
plush
mouthfeel
a
damn
fine
beer
they
use
this
as
the
base
for
the
alpha
king
challenge
held
annually
during
the
great
american
beer
festival
at
falling
rock
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
beautiful
rocky
head
great
citrus
aroma
unfiltered
copper
color
awesome
hop
finish
nice
malt
balance
hops
had
a
great
citrus
aroma
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
the
citrus
did
show
up
in
the
finish
which
seemed
a
little
on
the
harsh
quininelike
side
notes
well
built
and
one
of
the
best
ales
in
the
us
hop
character
is
above
the
rest
a
must
buy
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
mainly
sold
by
the
keg
clearly
not
one
to
pass
by
aggressively
hopped
with
a
complex
bitterness
that
just
keeps
growing
pine
citrus
and
resin
flavirs
are
pronounced
while
the
malt
takes
the
back
seat
o
a
great
take
on
a
pale
ale
and
i
would
seek
this
out
again
i
cant
put
this
ahead
of
hoppy
birthday
just
because
of
my
love
for
ipas
but
this
is
definitely
in
the
top
3
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
this
is
an
outstanding
pale
ale
definitely
one
of
the
best
but
not
thee
best
imo
until
i
try
pseudosue
this
just
explodes
with
hop
flavor
and
finishes
with
honey
and
i
want
to
say
toffeecaramel
not
as
piney
as
some
of
the
west
coast
ipas
i
am
use
to
but
i
like
this
flavor
profile
much
more
only
complaint
here
is
the
nose
which
is
definitely
lacking
although
something
i
can
live
without
i
had
been
wanting
to
get
my
hands
on
this
for
a
while
and
i
was
worried
my
anticipation
would
lead
to
a
classic
case
of
unmet
expectations
nope
i
waited
until
the
last
bottle
of
my
6pack
to
review
it
as
i
didnt
want
to
let
my
initial
euphoria
influence
my
rating
unjustly
pale
ale
ipa
call
it
whatever
you
want
this
beer
is
a
work
of
art
in
every
way
i
wanted
to
find
a
reason
not
to
rate
it
a
5
but
id
have
been
lying
to
myself
good
but
nothing
special
the
label
art
definitely
outdoes
the
quality
of
the
brew
for
me
love
the
name
and
love
the
design
sadly
do
not
love
the
beer
definitely
something
you
need
to
try
once
tho
one
of
my
favorite
apas
and
easy
to
get
with
a
little
bit
of
work
here
in
indiana
i
had
this
on
tap
at
three
floyds
and
it
is
the
real
deal
heaven
in
a
bottle
my
absolute
favorite
lucky
to
live
in
a
city
where
its
not
impossible
to
find
with
a
little
digging
and
a
connection
or
two
if
youve
never
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
zombie
do
what
youve
got
to
do
to
get
your
hands
on
some
you
wont
be
disappointed
amazing
my
tongue
loved
this
beer
i
just
want
more
and
more
its
so
good
on
draft
finally
able
to
get
a
hold
of
this
beer
great
citra
hop
aroma
and
good
flavor
glad
i
got
a
six
pack
dont
let
the
hype
tell
you
that
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
ever
made
but
also
make
no
mistake
that
this
is
a
good
beer
and
maybe
a
great
one
i
think
its
telling
that
if
i
could
just
walk
into
a
liquor
store
and
pick
this
up
on
the
regular
i
would
especially
in
the
summer
months
exceptional
balance
this
beer
will
dominate
you
and
ruin
your
future
i
have
had
this
3x
now
and
just
have
never
been
impressed
with
it
they
suck
getting
this
out
to
us
but
it
is
top
shelf
but
there
are
a
ton
of
great
beers
sorry
3
floyds
but
unless
you
start
taking
care
of
your
fans
im
out
whats
the
big
deal
i
think
miller
lite
tastes
better
great
color
crisp
taste
just
an
amazing
pale
ale
damn
good
beer
all
around
real
sharp
and
crisp
need
to
try
a
bunch
more
to
get
a
good
handle
on
this
beer
will
be
getting
more
did
not
taste
or
smell
like
psuedo
sue
at
all
clean
fresh
look
with
a
very
distinct
aroma
its
not
my
favorite
smell
but
its
a
definite
branding
of
the
beer
it
makes
it
special
and
very
unique
the
initial
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
unique
and
natural
its
bold
and
direct
and
demands
my
attention
i
dont
know
that
i
trust
it
but
i
believe
it
its
not
my
usual
taste
for
beer
but
i
damn
well
appreciate
it
much
like
my
boss
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
a
leader
and
knows
what
its
doing
o
really
amazing
the
aroma
knocked
me
off
my
feet
wasnt
expecting
that
very
solid
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
sixer
overall
a
top
3
beer
in
my
books
may
even
be
a
bargain
compared
to
most
6pack
of
this
quality
a
really
good
pale
ale
maybe
overrated
but
certainly
strong
all
around
beer
none
the
less
draft
pour
into
tulip
medium
amber
with
light
chill
haze
delicious
west
coast
character
with
excellent
balance
between
aroma
and
flavor
also
excellent
balance
with
the
bitterness
and
the
malt
nice
lingering
bitter
finish
excellent
ipa
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
although
i
think
it
may
not
be
so
popular
if
it
were
readily
available
it
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
is
hoppy
enough
for
hopheads
yet
balanced
and
smooth
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
but
too
damn
rare
i
will
definitely
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
im
not
a
pale
ale
fan
but
with
all
the
hype
around
this
beer
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
delicious
piney
ctrus
smell
upon
opening
the
bottle
poured
into
an
oversized
tulip
glass
with
head
less
than
1
quickly
turning
to
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
initial
taste
is
of
light
fruit
with
a
refreshing
lager
swallow
overall
i
give
this
brew
a
4
the
highest
in
the
category
for
me
wasnt
all
that
impressed
thought
that
sue
was
quit
a
bit
better
very
easy
drinking
apa
i
think
this
beer
really
appeals
to
the
standard
craft
beer
drinker
and
i
can
see
where
the
beer
geeks
view
this
as
overhyped
in
the
end
it
is
a
great
beer
regardless
of
standards
bottle
date
31215
opened
the
bottle
was
slapped
in
the
face
with
the
smell
poured
the
glass
the
smell
punched
me
in
the
nose
wow
what
a
smell
filled
the
whole
room
delicious
best
pale
ale
out
there
really
showcases
the
citrus
hops
well
while
being
unbelievable
drinkable
honestly
cant
get
enough
of
anything
fff
bottled
on
39
4
days
ago
outstanding
pale
ale
big
beer
that
stays
in
its
style
recommendation
one
of
those
legendary
beers
that
every
craft
beer
fan
needs
to
try
at
least
once
in
my
opinion
it
falls
off
after
6
weeks
so
drink
it
fresh
on
draft
at
fff
brewpub
poured
into
nonic
pint
coppery
with
a
finger
of
white
head
smells
like
ripe
mango
and
pine
resin
crisp
carbonation
outstanding
ill
take
one
of
these
anytime
a
friend
of
mine
share
a
bottle
of
zombie
dust
with
me
this
past
week
very
good
choice
here
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
would
definitely
refer
it
to
others
very
smooth
and
very
hoppy
i
actually
love
the
name
of
the
beer
and
the
feel
of
the
bottles
wrapping
looking
for
more
of
zombie
dust
received
in
trade
bottled
late
january
poured
into
snifter
great
beer
definitely
get
the
whole
pale
ale
vs
ipa
debate
this
tastes
like
a
hoppy
light
pale
ale
to
me
doesnt
have
the
weight
or
sharpness
of
an
ipa
that
being
said
this
is
friggin
awesome
in
the
top
20
on
the
250
list
is
probably
overrated
but
this
is
a
terrific
beer
similar
to
knee
deep
citra
extra
pale
ale
tons
of
flavor
great
smell
super
smooth
overhyped
nah
coming
from
the
east
coast
and
sitting
down
at
3
floyds
for
a
night
of
pints
has
been
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
beertravelled
life
zombie
dust
was
the
beer
i
was
most
excited
for
and
it
was
even
better
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
and
looking
back
at
the
considerably
low
abv
for
a
beer
with
that
much
flavour
im
even
more
astounded
the
only
beer
that
excited
me
more
was
permanent
funeral
wow
a
hopforward
pale
ale
very
welldone
to
say
the
least
great
choice
if
you
want
a
hoppy
brew
that
is
on
the
border
of
an
apa
and
an
ipa
its
a
great
beer
but
it
is
overrated
i
agree
with
the
fellow
who
said
that
the
label
is
better
than
the
beer
a
tad
bit
overrated
i
think
the
label
design
is
actually
better
than
the
beer
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
beer
that
is
overrated
because
it
comes
from
a
trusted
brewery
love
3
floyds
but
theres
no
way
that
this
brew
deserves
a
top
15
spot
it
is
a
shame
the
name
is
zombie
dust
because
the
second
coming
would
be
more
appropriate
the
name
aside
it
is
a
fine
beer
that
deserves
the
high
ratings
a
true
beauty
overall
i
was
dissapointed
with
all
the
great
ratings
i
ws
expecting
something
exceptional
it
is
cloudy
and
very
citrousy
it
is
a
good
beer
but
be
ready
to
pucker
up
on
some
excessive
hops
if
i
was
to
rate
this
for
what
it
is
a
pale
it
would
rank
up
their
at
the
top
but
it
reminds
me
so
much
like
a
iipa
in
which
i
think
it
is
above
average
i
think
it
is
overrated
i
had
the
privilege
to
try
some
of
their
other
brews
in
which
i
thought
were
outstanding
3f
is
a
world
class
brewery
just
dont
get
the
hype
on
the
dust
very
hard
to
find
this
beer
poured
from
bottle
great
mouth
feel
wow
took
two
years
to
find
it
finally
tried
it
and
definitely
like
it
very
good
indiana
beer
12
oz
bottle
that
my
friend
brought
back
from
his
trip
to
indiana
poured
into
a
snifter
in
a
league
of
its
own
as
a
pale
ale
as
the
hoppy
citrusy
goodness
makes
it
better
than
some
ipas
this
beer
is
great
but
prefer
it
fresh
being
on
the
lower
end
of
the
abv
spectrum
feel
it
drops
off
from
being
world
class
down
rite
amazing
beer
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
nice
hop
note
at
the
beginning
with
a
sweet
subtle
honey
finish
ive
been
trying
to
find
it
again
for
almost
a
month
now
might
just
drive
the
5
hours
to
get
some
more
a
great
every
day
beer
awesome
floral
bouquet
with
a
taste
to
match
the
depth
of
a
dipa
in
a
6
2
ale
big
rich
floral
and
citrus
fruit
yet
its
clean
and
clear
get
this
when
you
want
something
to
sip
without
a
huge
alcohol
punch
damn
just
a
bit
too
much
citrus
for
my
liking
very
good
beer
but
highly
overrated
there
are
dozens
of
equally
good
ipas
including
better
ones
from
3
floyds
great
beer
no
complaints
here
at
all
except
i
now
live
too
far
away
to
get
one
of
the
balanced
burrz
i
love
to
love
great
bitterness
balanced
by
the
fresh
and
sweet
if
you
like
hoppy
beer
this
is
a
one
if
your
not
sure
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
hoppy
upfront
taste
but
clean
on
the
back
end
o
this
beer
is
quite
good
but
its
not
crazy
good
like
the
hype
implies
if
you
can
find
it
definitely
grab
some
but
dont
go
nuts
trying
to
find
it
beautiful
citra
hops
but
there
are
better
citra
beers
awesome
beer
not
sure
how
this
is
a
apa
and
not
an
ipa
still
love
it
even
if
its
overpriced
very
good
if
you
can
find
it
legit
midwest
sippin
great
beer

get
love
it
my
absolute
favorite
beer
right
now
ttt
rocks
so
great
fruity
juicy
hops
awesome
one
if
not
the
best

great
hops
and

fantastic

theres

to

that
really
hits
the
mark
had
a
pint
on

at
local
bar
not
much
carbonation
or
foam
smooth
mouth
feel
very
easy
to
drink
bubble
gun
aroma
and
taste
so
well
balanced
nothing
stands
out
not
an
interesting
beer
but
a
very
good
one
ill
be
upfront
and
honest
it
might
not
be
that
much
better
than
sierra
nevada
more
fruity
bitterness
disappears
more
quickly
but
for
the
price
and
lack
of
abundance
is
it
really
worth
it
that
being
said
super
solid
throughout
likely
sits
in
my
top
5
for
beers
i
rate
it
higher
than
sierra
nevada
sure
but
im
not
sure
that
makes
it
better
m
typical
pale
ale
mouthfeel
nothing
of
note
here
interestingly
enough
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
to
date
i
had
to
get
it
in
a
trade
wonderful
tasty
this
beer
fresh
has
so
much
zest
and
bite
from
the
hops
its
awesome
really
crisp
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
hops
arent
overbearing
and
balanced
out
well
with
citrus
flavor
for
a
hoppy
beer
its
a
good
one
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
on
point
its
good
it
has
all
the
familiar
characteristics
of
an
ipa
but
brought
down
and
not
losing
any
of
the
flavor
its
full
beautiful
and
balanced
to
perfection
a
wonder
apa
a
step
above
the
space
station
or
other
apa
offerings
from
fff
sought
this
out
while
in
indianapolis
success
and
bliss
this
is
a
very
good
beer
great
beer
got
a
plug
on
nbcs
chicago
fire
tv
show
one
of
the
characters
went
to
the
fridge
for
a
beer
and
pulled
out
a
zombie
dust
damn
near
perfect
of
you
love
piney
resincoated
american
ipa
makes
the
top
5
of
the
style
to
me
and
the
rest
of
beer
guzzling
north
america
id
like
it
more
if
i
wasnt
allergic
to
overly
hoppy
beers
its
very
good
i
dont
believe
it
is
overhyped
nor
are
most
beers
but
its
a
very
good
ipa
lots
of
tropical
fruits
crisp
dry
and
tasty
its
good
but
after
having
had
so
many
other
ipas
ive
realized
that
the
grass
is
always
greener
when
hearing
about
beers
from
across
the
river
zombie
dust
never
fails
to
disappoint
this
beer
pours
golden
with
an
appetizing
haze
the
aroma
hits
you
with
a
burst
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
chopped
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
satisfyingly
medium
bodied
with
a
lively
fizz
and
a
depth
of
taste
that
awakens
your
tongue
there
is
a
je
ne
sais
quoi
here
something
that
drives
both
hopheads
and
casual
beer
drinkers
alike
to
go
wild
over
this
beer
i
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
bold
but
not
overpowering
hopping
and
the
incredible
gush
of
tropical
fruit
that
sets
this
apart
v
the
value
is
good
because
if
youve
got
it
in
your
hands
you
probably
had
to
work
for
it
thus
youre
probably
willing
to
pay
whatever
price
tag
is
on
it
seriously
though
it
is
worth
every
penny
lived
up
to
the
hype
had
on
tap
at
the
3
floyds
brewpub
a
very
great
tasting
beer
when
fresh
this
may
be
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
damn
good
beer
how
a
pale
ale
should
taste
fantastic
but
its
not
as
good
as
pseudo
sue
have
only
ever
had
this
one
from
bottles
so
it
was
nice
to
try
it
on
tap
great
use
of
citra
the
nose
really
pops
but
the
mouthful
may
be
the
best
thing
here
from
almost
the
start
to
almost
the
end
there
is
a
constant
somehow
smooth
yet
biting
bitterness
that
keeps
you
wondering
when
it
is
going
to
give
out
and
it
keeps
on
going
delicious
like
the
el
dorado
of
beer
best
beer
on
the
planet
prove
me
wrong
working
on
getting
some
heady
topper
to
see
if
it
can
meet
the
hype
tastes
sharply
of
peppery
and
slightly
fruity
hops
with
marked
astringent
tannic
tealeaf
flavors
however
the
hop
flavors
are
not
as
defined
as
in
space
station
middle
finger
for
instance

everything
about

it
was
the
second
beer
i
had
had
from
three
floyds
and
has
been
the
best
to
date
followed
by
their
blackheart
this
pale
has
a
unique
taste
thats
almost
hard

i
would
go
into

if
i
could
only
get

75had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
beer
multiple
times
throughout
the
past
3
years
or
so
but
this
review
is
based
on
when
i
got
my
zd
cherry
popped
it
was
poured
into
a
small
taster
glass
from
the
bottle
and
i
could
smell
an
intense
passionfruit
aroma
before
i
even
picked
the
glass
up
from
the
countertop
the
nose
on
this
thing
absolutely
blew
my
mind
huge
amounts
of
juicy
tropical
fruit
amazingness
the
flavor
was
the
same
and
led
me
to
believe
that
some
sort
of
actual
fruit
was
added
to
this
beer

was
so
excited
when
my
beer
guy
produced
an
under
the
counter
bottle
of
this
highly
rated
apa
pours
a
cloudy
orange
tan
with
a
slight
head
that
quickly
turns
to
a
thick
off
white
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
the
ale
the
nose
is
deep
and
malty
sweet
but
not
bitter
with
the
hoppiness
normally
found
in
a
pale
ale
there
is
pine
and
grass
notes
but
not
much
citrus
on
the
nose
it
sips
clean
with
a
pleasant
mouth
coating
effect
not
bitter
but
not
sweet
either
rather
balanced
and
very
pleasant
the
tongue
is
malty
and
rich
with
a
tangy
bitterness
on
the
start
and
an
unexpected
sweetness
on
the
finish
the
balanced
flavor
lasts
long
after
the
ale
is
gone
the
flavors
of
this
ale
are
astoundingly
balanced

thats
the
best
beer
in

experience
i
think
shes

dust
is
a
beer
i
never

tired
of
every

i
have
one
it
continues
to
be

i
cant
recommend
this
beer
highly
enough
its
been
tough
to
find
over
the
last
7
or
8
months
though
i
had
to
go
to
the
brewery
to
pick
this
up
and
it
was
flying
out
of
the
door
my
perfect
beer
first
3
floyds
appearance
and
smell
are
consistently
great
zombie
dust
takes
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
beyond
their
other
great
beers
i
love
bitter
beers
with
little
sweetness
zd
has
a
consistent
taste
from
start
to
finish
it
is
also
one
of
the
only
beers
that
tastes
the
same
whenever
i
have
it
o
this
beer
deserves
any
praise
that
it
gets
honestly
the
best
of
the
pale
ale
category
excluding
the
i
by
miles
i
would
drink
this
all
day
and
would
probably
eat
someones
brains
if
it
meant
getting
this

im
not
a
hop
head
but
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
bitterness
pushes
more
to
an
ipa
vs
apa
to
me
but
who
cares
glad
to
have
it
fresh
too
i
had
my
first
pliny
the
elder
recently
and
i
didnt
see
the
hype
this
is
worth
it

of

sometimes
a

the

zombie

is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
its
for
damn
sure
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
massive
flavor
for
its
abv
and
throws
out
notes
you
only
get
with
the
best
double
ipas
in
the
world
a
remarkable
feat
if
you
ask
me
its
as
of
a
session
dreadnaught
as
youll
ever
find
i
just
cant
get
over
how
stunning
this
ale
is
and
the
pure
genius
crafted
into
this
for
me
dreadnaught
is
the
worlds
best
double
ipa
and
this
is
of
the
same
breed
i
will
buy
this
every
single
time
i
see
itim
hoping
its
often
it
lives
far
beyond
any
hype
youve
read
or
heard
one
of
the
brews
with
big
expectations
ive
had
and
fulfilled
all
those
expectations
by
blowing

and

much
take

the

treat
nothing
here
that
i
havent
had
before
zombie
dust
is
undoubtedly
excellent
beer
im
honestly
shocked
at
how
much
flavor
it
has
the
hop
flavor
really
drives
it
into
a
class
of
its
own
this
really
is
the
best
american
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
wow
find
some
overall
great
apaipa
with
huge
drinkability
i
could
see
a
six
of
this
is
easily
being
done
in
one
night
but
i
would
like
to
drink
one
a
night
through
the
holidays
great
first
beer
to
any
night
overall
a
fantastic
alei
hate
hearing
about
how
good
a
beer
is
before
i
try
it
as
the
case
here
but
this
brew
lives
up
to
the
hypethe
potent
citrus
flavor
is
balanced
superbly
by
pale
malts
that
could
exist
on
their
own
and
create
a
fantastic
tasteits
vibrant
and
light
making
it
ultra
drinkablei
could
easily
kill
a
sixer
while
playing
poker
or
hanging
out
with
friendshighly
recommended
this
will
be
an
ale
youll
remember55
overall
its
easy
to
see
why
this
wicked
pale
ale
is
always
in
such
high
demand
currently
at
7
in
beeradvocates
top
250
beers
this
is
truly
a
marvel
a
big
bold
flavorful
pale
ale
gushing
with
pungent
fruity
hops
it
manages
to
be
complex
yet
extremely
smooth
and
wellbalanced
theres
really
nothing
i
would
change
about
this
beer
it
may
technically
be
labeled
an
american
pale
ale
but
for
me
it
is
the
quintessential
ipa
it
also
has
one
of
the
best
names
and
label
art
of
any
craft
beer
out
there
a
beauty
to
behold
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
complex
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
the
hop
presence
is
certainly
there
but
its
well
balanced
with
the
citrus
flavors
and
malt

i
like
this
a
lot
but
hoped
the
taste
mimicked
the
smell
and
it
never
fulfilled
that
for
me
othis
is
a
fantastic
beer
ive
lived
45
minutes
from
the
brewery
for
10
years
and
have
just
now
found
this
picked
up
a
case
tonight
after
having
it
on
tap
last
weekend
if
you
dont
have
it
trade
for
it
if
you
have
it
relish
it
if
you
can
trade
it
share
an
additional
note
on
availability
if
you
live
in
the
southern
indianalouisville
ky
area
you
can
find
some
bottles
at
bridge
liquors
in
new
albany
in
they
limit
you
to
two
bottles
but
at
least
they
have
it
their
major
competitor
in
clarksville
in
has
this
ale
listed
as
in
stock
even
as
i
write
this
but
at
3
pm
today
they
were
sold
out
o
pale
ale
with
great
feel
drinkability
and
the
flavor
of
a
ipaiipa
really
good
stuff
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
sure
great
brew
o
easily
the
most
complex
apa
ive
tasted
really
solid
hop
flavor
profile
with
some
nice
malts
to
back
it
up
if
i
could
get
easily
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
overall
this
is
probably
a
fresh
bottle
but
its
been
4
months
since
i
had
it
fresh
at
the
pub
which
blew
my
mind
and
took
home
a
case
which
ive
enjoyed
very
much
i
think
my
palates
evolved
quite
a
bit
with
all
the
imperial
stouts
and
dipas
ive
had
recently
beers
with
more
malt
backbone
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
i
dont
care
if
ba
calls
it
an
apa
that
showcases
the
citra
hops
and
what
it
can
do
given
a
minimal
malt
backbone
honestly
after
having
had
more
apasipas
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
think
a
lot
of
it
is
branding
this
beer
didnt
sell
well
when
it
was
known
as
cenotaph
limited
distribution
almost
but
not
quite
brewpub
only
and
an
otherwise
excellent
beer
regardless
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
so
i
cant
take
too
much
away
from
it
o
way
above
the
norm
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
up
there
with
head
hunter
white
rajah
for
us
ohioians
but
this
is
like
liquid
gold
for
us
as
well
for
the
limit
that
is
in
ohio
it
is
that
good
and
there
is
a
reason
why
this
is
13
on
the
list
its
that
good
and
everybody
backs
it
as
that
overall
a
very
nice
apa
from
3f
just
wish
i
had
access
to
more
it
is
high
quality
outstanding
hop
aroma
and
flavor
have
this
hophead
in
headoverheels
love
cries
out
for
a
spicy
food
pairing
a
must
try
for
all
hop
lovers
embrace
the
undead
personal
rate
4
75
i
can
see
why
this
brew
ranks
as
the
1
apa
its
extremely
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
superbly
gentle
carbonation
that
never
feels
fizzy
but
still
manages
to
foam
the
beer
up
on
the
palate
the
result
is
a
smooth
foamy
mouthfeel
thats
as
enjoyable
as
the
aromas
and
flavors
closes
quite
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
across
the
palate
which
invites
taking
another
sip
12
ounce
bottle
this
just
came
to
the
store
yesterday
afternoon
so
im
hoping
its
a
fresh
batch
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
that
stays
around
for
a
very
long
time
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
it
smells
mostly
like
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
mango
tropical
fruits
along
with
pine
hops
orange
peel
and
some
light
bready
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
floralearthy
hops
noticeable
and
a
nice
lingering
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
sticky
but
also
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
know
id
buy
this
again
if
i
came
across
it
10
99
a
six
pack
and
worth
every
penny
the
craftsmanship
to
this
beer
is
second
to
none
its
an
extremely
well
done
beer
i
dont
look
at
it
is
as
the
end
all
be
all
of
ipas
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
the
way
this
beer
is
crafted
makes
it
an
automatic
winner
its
a
definitely
a
magical
treat
that
i
would
enjoy
anytime
extremely
well
done
o
easy
drinking
flavorful
apa
that
pushes
the
limits
and
its
all
about
the
taste
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
six
pack
of
this
id
heard
so
many
positive
things
about
it
so
im
quite
excited
to
finally
be
able
to
review
this
it
has
a
dark
honey
pour
very
slightly
cloudy
with
a
thin
foam
head
and
very
fine
lacing
scent
of
grapefruit
pine
earthiness
and
more
mellow
citrus
so
far
nothing
particularly
out
of
the
ordinary
upon
first
sip
i
figure
out
what
its
all
about
extremely
well
balanced
combination
of
hops
and
malts
that
continue
to
mellow
out
in
the
aftertaste
i
taste
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
too
a
really
fantastic
brew
mouthfeel
is
perfect
light
carbonation
and
a
certain
heaviness
to
it
highly
recommended
o
great
beer
and
ever
greater
on
cask
easy
drinking
definitely
grab
a
couple
of
glasses
if
they
have
it
especially
for
only
5
for
an
imperial
pint
the
nose
on
this
is
even
better
than
normal
and
as
per
usual
its
flavor
packed
o
i
am
so
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
only
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
hopefully
i
will
land
more
in
a
trade
soon
zd
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
hoppy
beers
i
have
tried
and
easily
stands
up
beside
pliny
and
heady
at
this
point
i
am
unable
to
decide
which
i
like
better
but
zombie
dust
is
magnificent
thanks
to
tim
from
the
beer
club
for
bringing
me
a
six
pack
today
at
work
poured
into
my
dfh
pint
glass
beautiful
hazy
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
that
give
way
to
some
decent
lacing
i
could
smell
it
from
across
my
desk
when
i
poured
it
the
wonderful
fruity
notes
from
the
citra
hops
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
laughing
dog
citra
hop
ale
they
did
for
capital
ale
houses
10th
anniversary
i
wish
it
were
winter
we
could
make
it
into
ice
blocks
and
skate
on
it
and
then
melt
it
in
the
spring
time
and
drink
it
yeah
wish
i
had
more
than
a
sixer
o
one
of
my
top
5
ipas
of
all
time
definitely
should
grab
this
one
if
you
can
overall
this
is
a
great
hoppy
pale
ale
it
leans
more
of
an
ipa
tons
of
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
zombie
dust
and
something
i
will
happily
have
again
overall
easily
the
best
pale
ive
ever
had
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
late
springearly
fall
all
the
extras
with
this
beer
are
nice
as
well
great
bottle
design
and
name
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
very
enjoyable
apa
great
job
three
floyds
finally
received
some
more
of
this
after
putting
it
off
for
so
long
thanks
mcain04
i
was
afraid
this
time
around
that
it
wouldnt
be
as
good
i
was
worried
that
maybe
i
had
hyped
it
up
to
myself
before
and
that
i
was
overrating
it
bigtime
i
was
scared
that
my
palate
had
changed
and
zombie
dust
would
no
longer
be
the
same
sweet
nectar
i
fell
in
love
with
the
first
time
around
luckily
all
of
my
worries
were
wiped
away
the
second
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
took
a
nice
whiff
and
had
another
sip
this
stuff
is
simply
amazing
so
perfectly
balanced
and
so
insanely
drinkable
all
things
considered
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
had
been
trying
to
get
for
sometime
and
finally
accomplished
it
over
the
summer
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
wanted
to
savor
these
over
a
few
night
but
had
3
one
night
and
3
the
next
o
a
damn
good
beer
however
i
believe
it
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
i
feel
like
the
pine
overwhelmed
the
citrus
flavors
but
it
is
three
floyds
they
love
their
bitter
hops
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
stands
up
to
its
reputation
ive
recently
had
dreadknaught
and
apocalypse
cow
and
while
both
of
those
have
significantly
more
heat
zombie
dust
takes
the
cake
with
balance
flavor
and
pale
ale
ipa
perfection
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
to
date
and
being
a
hophead
something
i
can
honestly
session
if
only
i
had
cases
of
this
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
small
snifter
no
bottle
dating
orange
marmalade
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
white
head
moderate
retention
oily
clear
lacing
clearly
loaded
with
hops
aroma
dominated
by
apricot
hoppy
goodness
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
hiding
behind
it
taste
obviously
has
a
nice
biting
bitterness
to
it
the
hops
are
citrussy
and
once
again
apricot
stands
out
with
some
grapefruit
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
around
though
it
should
really
be
classified
as
an
ipa
cheers
deserve
a
worldclass
rating
i
cant
believe
i
lasted
this
long
without
this
beer
o
really
stellar
sessionable
pale
ale
the
flavors
are
what
i
want
in
a
hop
forward
beer
all
the
time
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
hope
to
get
some
more
sometime
soon
fff
is
a
great
brewery
and
zd
is
an
amazing
beer
i
have
yet
to
have
this
on
tap
but
will
continue
to
look
highly
recommended
brew
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
this
is
my
favorite
pale
ale
probably
the
best
pale
ale
far
as
taste
and
balance
goes
i
love
the
citrus
that
offsets
the
dryness
its
not
overly
bitter
that
its
smacks
you
or
ruins
your
tastebuds
for
the
night
its
a
really
balanced
and
really
refreshing
pale
ale
glad
im
so
close
to
the
brewery
so
i
can
get
this
stuff
whenever
available
if
you
have
the
oppertunity
dont
hesitate
taste
is
lovely
citrustangy
and
hoppy
with
a
firm
and
heavy
malt
foundation
still
the
taste
is
predominantly
hops
and
this
premium
pale
ale
is
absolutely
a
winner
in
my
book
id
repeatedly
purchase
if
i
could
find
this
anywhere
all
in
all
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
anytime
doesnt
amtter
if
you
sittin
in
tha
garage
with
a
few
friends
or
at
the
pub
on
a
cold
winter
day
a
overall
a
good
beer
that
in
my
opinion
tastes
very
similar
to
pliny
the
elder
sessionable
as
hell
and
tasty
to
boot
would
drink
again
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
my
favorite
bartender
here
in
fort
wayne
in
suggested
it
to
me
and
boy
was
he
right
this
is
a
new
level
for
ipas
and
honestly
the
new
standard
ive
been
drinking
beer
for
awhile
now
and
honestly
this
is
the
best
ipa
ive
had
yet
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
taste
this
direct
from
the
tap
i
highly
suggest
it
medium
body
medium
somewhat
lively
carbonation
but
retains
a
level
of
creamy
smoothness
as
well
terrific
mouthfeel
and
simply
terrific
overall
does
a
lovely
job
of
balancing
intricate
hoppy
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
the
latter
never
overwhelms
the
tastiest
aspects
of
the
beer
thanks
to
mjmoser
for
a
handful
of
ridiculously
fresh
bottles
really
good
stuff
not
the
life
event
i
was
hoping
for
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
masterfully
crafted
by
one
of
the
best
really
stands
alone
in
quality
a
tremendously
tremendous
craft
pours
golden
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
with
bit
of
a
sweet
bready
malt
underbelly
a
very
nice
sweet
and
juicy
flavor
of
some
tropical
and
citric
fruits
less
malt
presence
in
the
flavor
than
was
in
the
aroma
a
nice
medium
active
body
overall
awesome
awesome
awesome
awesome
beer
tops
the
list
of
apas
for
me
wish
i
had
consistent
access
to
this
overall
this
was
well
worth
the
hype
had
a
friend
ship
me
two
bottles
and
he
advised
i
drink
them
quick
the
citrus
hops
are
awesome
and
this
beer
really
makes
me
wish
i
could
just
go
to
indiana
and
taste
it
off
tap
o
an
excellent
beer
and
example
of
the
apa
style
three
floyds
has
nailed
it
o
this
beer
is
just
simply
great
i
would
really
like
to
experience
another
american
pale
ale
that
can
battle
up
to
the
zombie
dust
prefectly
balance
very
american
flavor
forward
craft
beer
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
great
foamy
white
head
pine
grapefruit
mango
nice
grass
notes
caramel
and
lemon
on
the
nose
grapefruit
lemon
pine
orange
caramel
very
smooth
malt
character
with
a
great
hop
bite
medium
on
the
palate
with
a
balanced
malt
and
pine
citrus
finish
overall
great
beer
amazing
for
the
style
and
i
could
drink
probably
20
in
a
session
although
maybe
not
at
over
6
ok
not
sure
about
this
one
cant
see
any
date
on
the
bottle
so
going
to
go
with
this
would
be
happy
to
give
it
another
shot
but
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
first
try
o
i
really
like
it
but
it
pains
me
to
review
it
in
this
state
given
the
circumstances
on
the
plus
side
i
could
really
see
this
being
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
fresh
so
needless
to
say
ill
be
on
the
hunt
for
fresh
bottles
of
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
tropical
mango
papaya
maybe
a
touch
of
a
fruit
cocktail
syrup
a
bit
of
grapefruit
as
well
taste
follows
the
nose
mostly
with
the
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
the
tropics
theres
also
a
really
nice
caramelly
malt
note
on
the
finish
that
wasnt
too
noticeable
on
the
nose
ends
with
some
really
pleasant
bitterness
that
invites
you
to
take
another
drink
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
extremely
refreshing
the
beer
absolutely
lives
up
to
the
hype
has
enough
complexity
and
intensity
to
keep
it
interesting
while
being
refreshing
enough
to
quaff
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
given
the
pedestal
my
beer
friends
puts
this
beer
upon
i
was
a
initially
underwhelmed
when
i
finally
had
a
full
pint
in
front
of
me
the
beer
was
surprisingly
clear
and
lacking
in
the
nice
creamy
head
i
was
expecting
the
first
fruity
citrusy
whiff
put
those
fears
to
bed
however
delicious
hoppy
goodness
with
bits
of
orange
peel
the
taste
follows
with
a
nice
hop
punch
and
tastes
of
grapefruit
just
awesome
this
embodies
the
smooth
fruity
ipaaipas
that
i
love
really
great
stuff
that
is
not
to
be
missed
if
you
have
the
opportunity
o
a
beer
that
crosses
the
boundaries
between
apa
and
ipa
who
really
cares
though
as
long
as
it
tastes
good
this
beer
definitely
tastes
good
wish
i
had
easy
access
to
this
as
a
year
round
staple
in
my
fridge
3
floyds
does
excellent
hoppy
beers
and
zombie
dust
is
no
exception
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
do
not
live
in
the
distro
are
for
zd
but
if
i
did
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
will
buy
this
beer
whenever
i
have
the
opportunity
o
i
like
it
i
really
do
but
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
definitely
will
get
again
but
im
not
going
to
make
it
a
priority
though
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
for
sure
o
is
this
the
best
pale
ale
on
earth
no
question
this
goes
without
saying
but
its
a
lot
better
on
tap
had
a
few
bottles
after
this
and
wasnt
the
same
5
o
an
enjoyable
apa
that
is
firmly
in
the
ipa
or
session
ipa
territory
if
we
call
it
a
session
ipa
its
the
best
ive
had
of
the
class
to
date
will
have
to
check
my
rating
on
all
day
ipa
big
thanks
to
warnerry
for
the
bottle
i
would
love
another
and
will
buy
6
next
time
i
see
it
theres
really
no
denying
that
is
an
exceptional
apa
its
got
3fs
flair
for
sure
and
nearly
on
par
with
alpha
king
aroma
is
an
a
tons
of
big
juicy
tropical
citrus
fruits
subtle
pine
and
vibrant
florals
more
tropical
fruit
here
than
usual
3fs
its
so
hop
fruity
but
balanced
with
sweeter
melon
fruit
caramel
and
cereal
grains
the
pour
is
decent
semitranslucent
with
a
golden
body
and
fluffy
creamy
starch
white
head
the
body
is
lightmedium
for
a
3fs
product
big
on
flavor
though
not
quite
perfectly
balanced
less
of
the
great
tropical
fruit
compared
to
the
nose
but
more
lemon
grass
strawberry
and
melon
starburst
candy
also
caramel
and
malted
cereal
with
some
light
soapy
qualities
finish
lingers
very
well
with
more
florals
and
citrus
i
definitely
liked
alot
but
maybe
not
quite
on
par
with
alpha
king
though
that
is
definitely
debatable
appearance
is
a
light
bronzehoney
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
creamylooking
head
the
smell
is
of
grapefruits
and
oranges
and
the
infamous
citra
hop
the
only
hop
this
brew
is
made
with
refreshing
taste
follows
the
nose
absolutely
refreshing
clean
crisp
citrus
fruit
taste
with
more
pineapple
orange
and
an
alcohol
sweetness
coming
into
play
as
it
warms
clean
smooth
almost
milky
mouthfeel
plenty
of
carbonation
keeps
it
light
and
highly
drinkable
the
hype
is
real
on
this
and
in
my
opinion
it
truly
is
the
best
apa
on
the
market
just
swung
by
the
brewery
again
to
pick
up
another
case
of
24
too
good
to
pass
up
poured
into
a
teiku
glass
very
nice
orange
color
with
a
soft
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
outstanding
all
of
the
whiffs
for
what
comes
next
citrus
galore
grapefruit
orange
lemon
zest
and
you
get
a
bit
of
balance
with
some
apricot
and
mango
notes
the
finish
is
nice
and
soft
carbonation
is
medium
fantastic
beer
there
are
some
lucky
folks
who
live
near
this
brewery
i
cant
say
that
its
better
than
pliny
off
what
im
having
here
its
dipa
vs
apa
and
apples
vs
oranges
but
its
a
good
beer
ill
have
to
try
it
on
bottles
one
day
o
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
was
very
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
try
ontap
it
drinks
right
on
the
edge
of
apaipa
styles
but
feels
more
like
a
hefty
apa
than
a
light
ipa
although
neither
of
those
would
be
wrong
a
superb
beer
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
it
was
brewed
exclusively
with
citra
need
to
try
brewing
one
of
those
soon
thanks
redliner8
i
have
yet
to
have
a
fff
that
wasnt
near
or
at
the
top
of
its
class
i
cant
drive
past
munster
without
stopping
it
is
an
illness
believe
in
this
beer
fff
has
changed
everything
again
do
this
beer
shines
through
the
effective
application
of
citra
dry
hopping
with
qualities
that
are
usually
reserved
for
draft
only
releases
that
briefly
see
the
light
of
day
at
the
nations
better
beer
bars
if
it
were
an
ipa
the
smell
would
be
questionable
as
an
apa
it
is
satisfactory
its
appeal
is
mighty
because
the
brewer
was
not
tempted
to
overreach
and
strive
for
a
high
gravity
monster
like
some
other
of
the
best
hops
delivery
vehicles
around
this
beer
is
better
for
being
a
mere
pale
ale
overall
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
hadif
not
the
best
m
great
bite
from
carbonation
quite
a
light
body
overall
more
so
than
most
apas
even
its
refreshing
and
resinous
at
once
the
clean
leave
is
again
amazing
oa
delicious
pale
ae
with
great
flavor
a
great
every
day
beer
part
of
my
problem
is
this
style
of
beer
i
cannot
make
a
unbiased
opinion
without
the
conflict
of
complaining
that
it
is
simply
way
too
hoppy
i
tried
the
beer
while
helping
a
friend
make
some
home
brew
during
a
slightly
chilly
day
the
beer
did
hit
the
spot
but
it
just
isnt
up
my
alley
if
you
have
an
insatiable
craving
for
more
hops
this
is
a
great
beer
for
you
i
prefer
a
much
more
malty
beer
with
hops
to
help
balance
it
out
do
very
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
5
of
these
overall
this
is
a
solidly
made
apa
4
0
o
i
give
it
a
5
over
all
because
even
if
i
have
4
5s
in
the
judging
scaled
this
beer
works
so
well
as
a
whole
that
it
deserves
a
5
fff
has
really
nailed
the
apa
and
i
would
consider
this
to
be
probably
the
best
apaipawhatever
hoppy
beer
out
there
pliny
the
elder
fans
if
you
havent
tried
this
get
ready
for
a
contender
o
ive
been
drinking
3f
beers
since
2006
but
to
me
this
blows
away
any
other
beer
they
have
made
it
easily
replaces
hopslam
as
my
favorite
all
around
beer
the
only
problem
is
that
as
it
moves
up
the
charts
it
is
becoming
nearly
impossible
to
get
even
at
the
brewery
except
on
draft
overall
this
is
the
finest
beer
on
earth
at
6
4
its
pushing
the
upper
limits
of
what
you
can
realistically
call
an
apa
but
it
doesnt
matter
what
a
beer
is
categorized
as
when
it
tastes
like
this
probably
one
of
the
best
apaipas
ive
ever
had
i
have
had
it
dozens
of
times
on
tap
and
out
of
the
bottle
and
neither
disappoint
a
light
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
of
citrus
hops
dominates
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
rich
citrus
hop
balance
perfectly
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
malt
to
make
one
of
the
tastiest
pale
ales
in
the
world
this
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
world
class
apa
or
slightly
less
hoppy
ipa
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
3
floyds
and
in
bottle
it
doesnt
disappoint
in
either
format
pours
off
golden
color
with
off
white
head
aroma
is
fantastic
dank
resinous
hops
dominate
the
nose
medium
mouthfeel
flavor
is
intensely
bitter
with
some
citrus
and
some
dank
taste
just
awesome

my

thinks
it
smells
like
caramelized

with
meat
not
necessarily
bad
it
certainly
is
not
just
a
citrusfloral
hop
aroma
i
would
place
the
nose
more
at
something
like
tamarind
or
other
meaty
asian
fruit
we
are
not
as
familiar
with
as
it
warms
it
gains
more
starchy
character
and
sweet
potatoes
in
general
the
nose
starts
off
explosive
and
mellow
out
so
no
reason
i
see
to
let
this
decant
like
most
beers
taste
has
a
nice
biscuity
quality
to
stave
off
astringency
huge
orange
juice
ultra
quenching
malt
character
with
mild
pineapple
like
alcohol
and
meaty
fruits
like
jackfruit

with
decent
amounts
of
butterscotch
richness
i
get

hot
damn
this
is
good
ive
now
had
about
three
bottles
of
this
over
the
past
few

and
the
palate
gets
super
quenching
small

acidity
citrus

whoa
like

category
demolition
right
here
forget
about
topping
this
ever
well
maybe
fresh

peeper
perhaps
a
little
boozy
for
the

but
who
cares
would
be
dangerous
as
a

cheers
o
really
solid
pale
ale
from
the
mid
west
digging
it
and
im
use
to
these
west
coast
hop
bombs
o
wow
this
was
really
good
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
im
not
sure
i
would
go
through
the
headache
to
get
more
but
it
does
almost
make
me
wish
that
i
lived
in
indiana
again
o
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
this
beer
current
trends
are
definitely
going
towards
bigger
and
better
while
zombie
dust
is
not
an
exception
to
this
it
is
a
pretty
strong
apa
it
does
highlight
that
fact
that
there
are
still
amazing
beers
that
arent
9
abv
and
120
ibus
moreys
bottom
line
this
was
sent
to
me
in
a
trade
he
said
that
he
picked
it
up
15
minutes
after
it
was
bottled
its
about
a
week
old
now
so
this
is
obviously
a
fresh
sample
it
ranks
up
there
with
pliny
heady
imo
the
lingering
bitterness
is
a
very
welcome
attribute
hope
to
have
this
one
again
cheers
oh
my
gosh
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
with
ease
of
drinking
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
but
then
everything
i
have
had
from
three
floyds
has
been
awesome
worth
the
hype
beautiful
color
incredible
smell
hops
and
malt
and
hops
and
malt
just
an
incredible
nose
it
tastes
like
liquid
gold
and
the
gold
coats
your
tongue
with
so
many
complex
flavors
this
is
a
top
american
beer
three
floyds
is
incredible
and
zombie
dust
fantatstic
o
a
great
citra
hops
beer
simple
all
over
but
nicely
made
i
would
like
to
do
a
tasting
of
all
these
top
ipas
sometime
to
see
how
they
stack
up
against
each
other
there
are
so
many
similarities
it
is
hard
when
they
are
not
tasted
together
o
this
really
is
a
nice
beer
but
perhaps
it
wasnt
as
fresh
as
it
could
have
been
i
will
seek
this
out
again
to
make
sure
i
give
it
a
fair
shot
but
to
me
citra
is
a
way
better
example
of
this
hop
o
this
beer
is
nearly
perfection
for
the
category
only
reason
i
say
nearly
perfection
is
because
i
dont
believe
anything
is
perfect
but
this
is
damn
close
one
of
my
top
5
beers
of
all
time
o
awesome
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
day
it
gets
more
harsh
as
it
warms
i
prefer
it
ice
cold
overall
even
though
i
only
live
about
30
minutes
from
three
floyds
i
for
some
reason
did
not
make
the
trip
out
there
to
get
me
some
of
this
sweet
nectar
until
about
2
weeks
ago
it
is
absolute
perfection
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
oh
who
the
hell
am
i
kidding
its
perfect
any
time
heady
topper
is
better
sorry
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
great
job
a
must
drink
beer
overall
it
wasnt
really
what
i
expected
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
however
i
really
didnt
find
it
to
be
as
full
on
hoppy
as
their
alpha
king
i
think
i
actually
prefer
it
over
zombie
dust
granted
i
only
had
6
oz
of
the
dust
so
i
really
need
to
enjoy
a
few
more
before
awarding
it
the
silver
medal

review
1
overall
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
beer
always
a
joy
to
drink
this
o
i
dont
get
the
hype
here
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
am
by
no
means
blown
away
i
definitely
thought
alpha
king
was
better
and
to
me
it
remains
the
standard
of
the
style
this
one
was
good
but
nothing
special
maybe
shipping
in
the
warm
weather
hurt
this
one
but
i
think
that
may
be
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
i
get
the
majority
of
my
reviewed
beers
from
shipped
trades
and
usually
dont
notice
ill
effects
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
if
it
were
a
local
but
not
something
id
seek
out
or
trade
for
again
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
o
a
number
of
damn
fine
pale
ales
out
there
this
one
may
be
a
bit
past
its
prime
given
its
age
of
three
months
fresh
from
the
brewery
the
day
of
bottling
but
i
am
not
sure
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
fantastic
presentation
of
the
citra
hops
but
a
beer
like
this
could
use
a
tad
more
head
and
carbonation
in
my
option
but
we
all
like
something
different
take
away
some
of
the
pine
resin
on
the
back
end
and
this
one
would
hit
my
personal
sweet
spot
dead
on
overall
an
excellent
brew
one
of
my
20
ipas
for
sure
o
probably
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
beers
it
just
such
a
nice
taste
and
body
and
finishes
so
smooth
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
with
and
enjoy
on
any
occasion
o
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hypeplain
and
simple
excellent
smell
extremely
tasty
high
drinkability
love
the
tropical
notes
to
this
one
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
of
this
style
o
a
pretty
brilliant
success
and
a
truly
good
apa
i
received
a
6
pack
and
ill
be
happy
to
share
it
with
multiple
friends
theres
some
excellent
hop
characteristics
throughout
on
this
but
my
oh
my
if
only
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
nose
best
aroma
ever
from
a
glass
here
with
superb
hop
bouquet
of
perfection
aromatic
nirvana
for
me
sweet
grapefruit
and
pine
as
well
in
there
and
if
somehow
in
a
tropical
way
the
tastefollows
suit
nice
nice
drinkability
finishes
crisp
and
bitter
with
a
very
appealing
lingering
hop
flavor
i
guess
i
really
favor
citra
hops
im
trying
to
pinpoint
any
slight
shortcoming
here
but
im
already
at
the
last
sip
and
havent
come
up
with
anything
even
though
the
malt
backbone
was
nice
it
was
backstage
of
the
hop
florality
new
word
and
i
like
it
that
way
im
biased
toward
anything
ipa
dipa
and
aipa
is
the
least
visited
of
the
style
for
me
but
of
the
ones
ive
tried
this
does
it
superb
easily
in
my
top
3
ever
im
onlysorry
i
cant
purchase
it

for

seek
it

loving

i
was
happy
to
run
into
a
guy
at
my
local
beer
stop
that
was
looking
to
trade
these
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
is
worth
trading
for
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
just
wish
fff
extended
their
distribution
to
the
east
coast
instead
of
planning
their
new
brewery
in
europe
the

this
beer
is
bitter
no
doubt
but
i
love
that
it
doesnt
linger
in
any
harsh
manner
the
finish
is
short
which
i
like
and
dont
like
at
the
same
time
i
like
that
it
keeps
me
sipping
or
gulping
more
and
more
but
i
dont
like
that
my
glass
is
soon
empty
unable
to
be
filled
with
this
blessed
brew
again
more
zd
please
the
beer
pours
a
light
rusty
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
the
beers
nose
is
incredibly
dank
and
defines
a
crisp
citra
hoppiness
however
there
is
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
which
makes
a
huge
impression
on
the
beers
taste
and
mouthfeel
thankfully
the
abrasively
bitter
hops
didnt
melt
off
my
eyebrows
and
taste
buds
because
the
mouth
watering
bitterdry
finish
makes
this
beer
something
special
i
would
easily
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
actually
have
trouble
not
finishing
it
within
5
minutes
after
opening
get
your
hands
on
some
and
thanks
pellinore1
for
the
hookup
this
has
a
huge
floral
hop
character
with
some
spicy
citrusy
notes
as
well
its
incredibly
hoppy
incredibly
drinkable
and
very
smooth
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles

more
trades
for
this
stuff
o
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
its
hard
not
hard
to
brew
a
pale
ale
but
theyre
made
a
truly
great
pale
ale
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
orange
hues
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
great
retention
and
abundant
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
extremely
fragant
with
the
smell
of
citrus
rind
freshly
cut
grass
and
orange
blossoms
on
the
nose
opens
with
pleasant
citrus
tangy
to
slighly
bitter
a
very
light
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
finishes
dry
crisp
and
clean
with
citrus
rind
and
a
touch
of
pine
and
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
an
very
refreshing
apa
which
shows
a
surprising
amount
of
complexity
for
a
brew
that
uses
only
citra
hops
o
ready
for
the
apocalypse
best
pale
ale
ive
had
truly
worth
all
the
hype
excuse
me
i
have
to
pop
a
few
walkers
in
the
cranium
now
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
and
much
better
than
alpha
king
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
will
have
it
again
if
given
the
opportunity
to
do
so
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
absolutely
fantastic
this
is
one
hoppy
beer
for
sure
its
almost
like
sticking
your
nose
right
in
a
bag
of
hop
pellets
tropical
fruits
and
citrus
are
the
stars
of
the
show
the
taste
is
also
absolutely
fantastic
its
seriously
a
hop
assault
of
the
first
order
the
relatively
low
abv
keeps
the
malt
profile
to
the
absolute
minimum
theres
just
a
bit
of
pale
slightly
biscuity
malts
if
you
can
cut
through
the
hops
letting
the
brilliant
citra
hops
shine
through
orange
and
grapefruit
come
out
big
on
the
flavor
leaving
the
tropical
aspects
to
more
of
a
backing
flavor
either
way
its
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
leaves
the
kind
of
dryness
thats
really
quite
similar
to
biting
into
a
hop
pellet
just
on
a
much
smaller
scale
theres
that
much
hops
in
here
guys
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
overall
this
is
the
king
of
pale
alesipas
for
the
hophead
superb
in
every
way
o
this
is
a
flawless
beer
absolutely
fantastic
overall
yes
this
is
very
good
didnt
quite
live
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
probably
because
people
talked
it
up
soooo
much
similar
to
many
american
ipas
ive
had
beyond
that
not
quite
sure
its
worth
all
the
fuss
it
has
received
its
delicious
but
theres
nothing
especially
unique
or
different
here
o
overall
if
you
have
a
chance
to
pick
this
up
definitely
give
it
a
try
most
people
absolutely
love
it
but
personally
i
think
there
are
better
ipas
on
the
shelf
that
you
dont
have
to
hunt
down
to
find
overall
i
see
the
hype
and
glad
that
a
pub
across
the
street
from
me
has
this
on
tap
i
seriously
love
this
beer
i
really
reminds
me
of
pliny
the
elder
with
all
the
hop
oil
and
bitterness
denfintly
a
must
have
so
much
i
think
i
will
have
a
3rd
just
cause
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
i
have
had
many
ipas
that
are
not
as
hoppy
as
this
pale
ale
but
this
beer
is
extremely
well
balanced
the
flavors
are
spot
on
and
this
is
probably
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
thanks
again
to
shrode21
for
the
trade
this
stuff
rocks
now
can
i
copy
this
with
my
homebrewing
skills
but
is
this
the
best
thing
ever
brewed
in
the
history
of
mankind
dont
think
so
come
on
its
a
pale
ale
get
over
it
o
just
a
fabulous
apa
although
truthbetold
it
is
more
ipa
than
apa
great
great
stuff
unfortunately
for
me
when
i
went
to
order
my
second
pint
with
dinner
the
waiter
told
me
id
my
first
glass
killed
their
keg
a
well
at
least
i
got
to
taste
it
fresh
ontap
less
than
2hours
from
the
brewery
there
was
no
gushing
when
i
removed
the
cap
but
there
was
a
finger
of
thick
tawny
head
by
the
time
that
i
finished
with
the
pour
color
was
an
ohsoslightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
was
rich
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
in
abundance
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
with
a
citrus
intensity
on
the
tongue
that
killed
off
all
of
the
weak
taste
buds
that
got
in
its
way
i
felt
like
the
fellow
in
the
old
maxell
tape
commercial
blown
back
in
my
seat
by
the
intensity
of
the
experience
the
finish
was
literally
breathtaking
i
really
felt
as
though
my
breath
had
been
taken
away
for
a
second
or
two
after
the
swallow
the
next
thing
to
hit
was
the
intensity
of
its
dryness
as
i
tried
to
catch
my
breath
the
hops
were
toying
with
me
to
see
if
i
measured
up
and
i
was
doing
my
best
to
rise
to
the
challenge
i
suppose
that
my
loss
means
that
i
will
be
transformed
into
a
zombie
at
some
point
but
if
a
transformation
must
take
place
better
in
my
mind
to
be
a
zombie
this
way
than
a
cyberperson
via
a
minhas
product
o
this
is
my
favorite
new
brew
i
had
read
great
things
about
this
beer
for
5
years
and
have
been
waiting
patiently
to
get
my
hands
on
it
anytime
anyone
wants
to
trade
this
beer
to
me
i
will
not
turn
it
down
what
a
great
combination
of
hops
and
grain
i
continue
to
be
amazed
as
i
drink
this
beer
i
love
this
stuff
if
i
lived
in
the
area
would
be
spending
a
lot
of
time
at
fff
great
beer
that
i
am
very
grateful
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
insane
drinkability
everything
you
love
about
your
favorite
dipas
but
at
6
4
what
a
great
idea
overall
again
get
some
of
this
fresh
if
you
can
nothing
like
it
my
favorites
of
this
style
in
san
diego
are
hoppy
birthday
and
new
millenium
from
alpine
beer
company
but
they
have
nothing
on
zd
if
this
was
on
the
shelf
here
along
with
pliny
sculpin
any
of
our
stuff
id
pull
the
zd
every
time
thanks
very
much
to
ba
apocalypsezombie
for
beering
me
this
gem
surprised
its
marketed
as
an
american
pale
ale
and
not
an
ipa
or
even
a
double
overall
a
wonderful
showcase
of
the
citra
hop
its
easy
to
see
why
three
floyds
has
struck
a
chord
with
this
beer
o
overall
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
another
one
of
these
this
is
my
first
fff
beer
and
i
am
very
pleased
overall
this
is
my
first
beer
from
three
floyds
and
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
try
it
out
since
it
wasnt
available
in
minnesota
i
have
to
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
3
floyds
o
amazing
drinkability
best
pale
ale
ive
had
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
though
it
is
borderline
ipa
to
me
i
have
to
give
this
beer
5s
all
the
way
across
there
is
nothing
that
compares
to
this
beer
in
the
apa
style
the
smell
is
unbelievable
with
grapefruit
mango
and
other
tropical
fruits
following
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
much
on
point
excellent
citrus
flavors
with
a
nice
crisp
citra
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
best
apa
ive
ever
had
and
best
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
three
floyds
it
is
a
golden
color
with
a
strong
floral
and
citrus
aroma
taste
is
loaded
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
a
nice
orange
flavor
and
without
a
strong
alcohol
presence
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
and
delicious
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
no
head
head
never
developed
as
a
consequence
of
the
care
taken
in
the
pour
by
the
attendant
incidentally
it
was
nice
to
see
that
the
3
floyds
staff
were
just
as
cheerful
as
ever
sarcasm
even
as
guests
of
firestonewalker
after
having
been
invited
to
their
beer
festival
the
3
floyds
staff
were
lifeless
provided
no
information
about
their
beers
and
couldnt
even
muster
a
smile
or
spare
a
youre
welcome
anyway
back
to
zombie
dust
the
beer
has
a
glorious
floral
bouquet
with
just
a
hint
of
peat
the
mouthfeel
which
enjoys
a
decent
balance
of
carbonation
is
good
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
grapefruit
forward
with
notes
of
peat
a
good
effort
overall
this
beer
rocks
and
im
leaving
it
on
my
wants
list
on
tap
at
the
three
floyds
smell
is
strong
and
crisp
glorious
hops
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
glad
i
got
to
have
it
on
cask
everything
is
so
strong
and
pronounced
i
cant
think
of
one
thing
id
change
about
this
beer
i
wish
fff
distributed
to
ct
this
might
be
my
favorite
beer
no
carb
room
temp
hell
yeah
adds
so
much
to
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
from
the
bottle
smells
like
a
pure
hop
liquid
from
the
bottle
maybe
the
best
smelling
beer
ever
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
smell
but
still
great
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
even
with
all
the
hop
flavor
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
while
working
in
the
sun
great
beer
here
by
far
my
favorite
three
floyds
i
have
tried
o
its
and
apa
bordering
on
an
ipa
if
you
ask
me
its
a
fantastic
example
of
either
style
big
thanks
goes
out
to
pmoney
for
sending
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
glassware
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
smokestack
tulip
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
citrus
citrus
hop
pine
and
pine
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
earth
and
pine
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
holy
refreshing
as
crap
batman
i
had
this
one
back
when
it
was
called
cenotaph
and
figured
i
would
have
to
revisit
it
now
that
it
is
bottled
and
i
am
quite
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
do
so
the
balance
on
this
one
made
it
quite
easy
to
drink
and
quite
nice
to
smell
as
well
i
actually
found
myself
taking
huge
mouthfuls
of
this
brew
rather
than
sipping
on
it
not
sure
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
bad
thing
but
i
definitely
didnt
mind
still
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
ive
had
get
this
on
your
palate
nose
up
front
of
pineapple
and
orange
zest
the
taste
is
citrusy
sweet
with
tangerines
fading
into
lemon
and
finishing
with
slightly
grapefruit
notes
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
for
me
pales
are
usually
too
mellow
and
bland
but
this
guy
could
stack
up
to
any
ipa
just
without
the
bitter
bite
o
this
is
a
tropical
hop
bomb
its
not
nearly
as
citrusy
and
hoppy
in
the
taste
compared
with
whats
in
the
aroma
but
its
good
stuff
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
moderate
body
the
beer
finishes
quite
dry
but
with
no
lingering
flavors
its
just
dry
while
this
is
a
good
beer
i
believe
it
is
overhyped
a
bit
o
a
great
beer
overall
with
the
best
aroma
of
any
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
unfortunately
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
match
the
aroma
and
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
but
its
still
a
fantastic
beer
o
not
a
bad
apa
this
beer
smells
great
but
the
taste
doesnt
line
up
i
prefer
the
readily
available
alpha
king
to
this
for
a
citra
bomb
there
are
better
options
many
thanks
to
rochefort10nh
for
the
trade
pours
a
nice
dark
straw
color
slightly
amber
incredible
nose
to
this
beer
when
its
fresh
beautiful
citrus
fruit
and
floral
notes
with
some
sweetness
kind
of
like
a
nice
mountain
breeze
i
could
almost
just
sit
here
all
day
and
smell
the
nose
had
i
not
then
tasted
how
ridiculously
good
this
beer
is
next
the
taste
is
so
well
balanced
with
the
hops
it
makes
this
by
far
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
bitter
but
not
to
bitter
the
malts
are
a
slight
caramel
mixed
wonderfully
with
citrus
notes
of
the
hops
just
an
incredible
example
of
the
pale
ale
category
poured
a
nice
strawberry
blonde
with
maple
tones
huge
hop
floral
nose
tropical
fruits
grassyherbal
notes
grapefruit
rinds
very
light
malt
background
the
grassyherbal
bitterness
dominates
the
flavor
however
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
the
fruits
regardless
a
nicely
made
pale
ale
o
hands
down
the
best
apa
ive
had
and
easily
in
my
top
5
beers
of
all
it
lives
up
to
the
reputation
and
at
35case
i
dont
think
id
buy
much
else
if
i
lived
near
fff
recieved
in
a
trade
with
chicago
john
thanks
buddy
for
the
ample
stash
of
zd
after
reading
so
much
love
for
zd
i
am
stoked
to
finally
sit
down
and
sip
a
few
poured
into
a
tulip
maybe
the
best
looking
brew
i
have
seen
sunset
orange
with
super
thick
sticky
two
finger
bright
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
leaving
beautiful
lacing
the
nose
maybe
as
good
or
better
than
kerns
citra
i
can
just
happily
sit
here
and
smell
this
for
hours
tropically
dense
from
the
citra
amazing
the
flavor
profile
is
citrusy
sweet
balanced
and
a
tad
bitter
from
the
60
ibu
perfect
the
mouth
is
crisp
clean
and
medium
weighted
perfect
for
this
holiday
weekend
at
the
shore
if
there
is
perfection
then
zd
is
it
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
sadly
not
available
on
the
west
coast
happily
sitting
with
two
six
packs
to
enjoy
over
the
next
couple
weeks
bravo
3
floyds
the
hype
is
more
than
justified
this
is
a
nice
apa
that
is
very
drinkable
but
there
are
better
american
pales
out
there
and
for
all
the
hype
this
beer
gets
i
was
thoroughly
disappointed
really
nice
hoppy
nose
and
good
bitterness
but
the
mouth
feel
and
finish
disappoint
this
hoppy
pale
ale
fan
in
the
end
slightly
above
average
85pt
beer
ive
had
zombie
dust
a
number
of
times
now
a
few
times
on
tap
and
i
always
pick
up
a
couple
six
packs
when
they
have
it
at
the
brewpub
while
im
traveling
through
poured
from
the
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
a
clear
dark
yellow
color
with
a
nice
crew
color
head
the
smell
is
citrus
and
earthy
almost
like
grassy
and
wheat
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
i
love
citra
hops
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
is
a
stand
up
ipa
id
take
it
every
time
oa
wonderful
beer
looking
forward
to
moving
out
to
indiana
and
being
able
to
have
this
year
round
m
clean
and
hoppy
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hoppiness
orange
zest
and
bold
citrus
standing
out
against
the
surprising
malt
side
im
afraid
that
ill
finish
off
this
six
pack
one
one
fell
swoop
overall
this
is
one
hyped
ale
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
no
doubt
of
the
west
coast
style
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
very
unique
beer
it
is
much
hopier
than
any
apa
i
have
had
but
it
is
also
much
more
balanced
than
any
west
coast
ipa
the
bitterness
is
very
smooth
but
the
hop
flavor
is
extraordinarily
large
a
trend
that
has
been
occurring
more
and
more
as
time
goes
on
a
fantastic
ale
no
doubt
in
my
mind
i
would
always
keep
this
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
on
tap
at
macnivens
for
craft
beer
week
poured
a
very
nice
middeep
copper
with
fantastic
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
as
it
went
down
very
nice
scent
a
wonderful
citrus
bitter
hoppiness
with
a
good
malt
sweetness
underneath
great
flavors
a
nice
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
wonderfully
citrus
and
slight
floral
hop
finish
that
stays
on
the
tongue
for
a
nice
bit
wonderfully
smooth
as
well
o
great
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
was
skeptical
at
first
being
that
ive
never
had
a
apa
ive
really
liked
before
except
hoppy
birthday
but
this
gives
the
apa
category
a
good
name
im
not
writing
zd
off
and
im
not
hating
on
them
in
fact
if
offered
i
will
try
again
im
not
scared
off
of
this
one
just
a
little
perplexed
by
the
hype
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
very
easy
drinking
if
made
readily
available
to
me
i
would
drink
this
regularly
and
in
excessive
quantities
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
white
head
modest
head
and
good
lacing
nose
is
all
citra
mango
peach
apricot
and
the
pittiness
of
these
fruits
really
comes
through
sweet
malt
and
some
pine
on
the
back
end
fantastic
consistency
as
soon
as
this
touched
my
lips
more
peach
and
mango
pit
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
brilliant
mouthfeel
fairly
full
with
some
consistency
and
something
that
i
think
should
really
be
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
moderate
bitterness
and
easily
consumed
a
toptier
apa
o
what
to
say
really
this
is
an
ipa
in
pale
ales
clothing
i
suppose
given
its
6
2
abv
its
given
a
pass
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
regardless
of
what
the
style
is
you
can
have
your
elite
dipas
this
apa
puts
them
to
shame
the
best
pale
ale
in
the
world
o
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
anything
is
perfect
but
i
simply
cant
bring
myself
to
give
this
beer
anything
less
then
a
perfect
score
this
is
my
first
perfect
5
rating
after
almost
200
reviews
and
i
dont
see
myself
giving
another
at
least
for
a
long
time
everything
about
this
beer
is
incredible
the
price
the
taste
the
feel
the
label
art
the
availability
well
not
for
most
of
us
but
at
least
its
guaranteed
fresh
for
a
hop
forward
pale
ale
this
beer
may
just
be
perfect
as
advertised
awesome
o
seriously
awesome
ipa
citra
hops
at
their
finest
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
there
is
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
this
beer
and
it
more
than
lives
up
to
it
trade
for
it
buy
it
just
make
sure
you
get
your
hands
on
this
wonderful
brew
ov
what
a
great
apa
probably
more
of
an
ipa
given
just
how
hop
forward
this
beer
is
i
wish
there
could
be
a
case
of
this
in
my
fridge
year
round
o
gonna
have
to
go
back
and
rerank
those
that
i
put
close
to
this
one
i
am
putting
it
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
i
could
drink
it
all
day
yet
it
has
a
powerful
punch
that
lets
me
know
i
am
drinking
real
beer
d
fits
the
bill
perfectly
this
is
how
i
have
always
imagined
what
my
ideal
pale
ale
is
a
great
profile
and
just
a
pure
overall
enjoyment
factor
i
have
never
been
a
huge
three
floyds
fanboy
but
this
might
be
their
crowning
acheivement
at
the
same
time
it
has
been
a
long
long
long
time
since
a
pale
ale
has
really
impressed
me
like
this
one
has
poured
into
a
nonic
a
clear
medium
golden
with
a
large
fluffy
white
crown
that
settled
very
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
a
big
shot
of
grapefruit
hops
hits
ya
in
the
nose
along
with
some
overripe
tangerinea
sweetish
biscuit
malt
is
noticable
as
well
a
healthy
dose
of
citric
hops
over
top
of
sweet
biscuit
on
the
palatemore
fruity
hops
than
bitter
a
great
pale
aleit
has
a
huge
dose
of
hops
but
its
actually
a
pretty
rounded
palate
oif
there
is
a
perfect
session
beer
for
hop
heads
this
is
it
its
strong
aggressive
and
multifaceted
while
still
being
easy
to
drink
pretty
awesome
stuff
i
only
wish
it
was
in
colorado
overall
looking
forward
to
tracking
down
more
of
this
beer
okay
lets
be
honest
this
isnt
a
pale
ale
right
its
so
hopped
up
id
easily
consider
this
an
india
pale
ale
the
profile
is
akin
to
the
classic
west
coast
style
with
its
big
juicy
tropical
fruit
notes
the
hops
are
kept
in
check
but
its
certainly
over
the
top
for
a
pale
ale
because
its
not
in
style
in
my
opinion
i
knocked
the
overall
down
a
bit
still
its
a
damn
tasty
beer
boy
i
thought
their
alpha
king
was
the
beallendall
of
apas
and
then
i
try
this
wow
amazing
beer
redefines
the
style
probably
the
hoppiest
apa
ive
ever
had
fantastic
o
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
every
sip
made
me
smile
its
rare
when
a
beer
is
everything
you
thought
it
would
be
but
fff
has
done
it
before
cue
gumballhead
rabbid
rabbit
etc
now
im
wondering
if
the
dark
lord
in
my
fridge
will
live
up
to
the
hypeat
any
rate
im
much
more
confident
now
that
it
will
i
need
to
take
a
trip
to
munster
asap
o
i
am
very
happy
that
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
on
my
way
into
chicago
i
wish
i
lived
closer
to
the
brewery
so
i
could
spoil
myself
like
this
more
often
oh
well
makes
it
that
much
more
special
i
would
def
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
can
get
it
o
this
was
a
good
beer
however
i
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
its
hype
it
tasted
good
i
just
thought
it
had
a
little
bit
too
much
of
a
sugary
taste
and
not
a
ton
of
flavor
for
a
highly
ranked
beer
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
one
of
my
least
favorites
on
the
top
100
list
that
being
said
i
enjoy
drinking
it
as
a
beer
in
a
6pack
its
definitely
worth
it
but
i
dont
think
it
is
necessarily
a
must
try
although
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
get
the
chance
putting
it
in
12oz
bottles
and
charging
35
dollars
for
a
case
is
awesome
fff
nice
to
see
you
price
something
reasonably
on
occasion
3
o
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
highly
regarded
brew
i
would
put
this
up
against
any
of
the
highly
rated
ipas
out
there
superb
from
the
bottle
poured
into
a
bells
tulip
perfect
50th
review
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenrod
color
with
a
12
inch
talk
head
in
my
tulip
pint
head
is
cream
colored
and
rather
dense
pretty
decent
retention
wow
aroma
is
fantastic
citra
hops
come
through
strong
and
sharp
in
my
nose
i
could
smell
this
all
day
bit
of
pine
lotta
citrus
taste
is
mellowed
and
more
appropriate
for
an
apa
though
you
wont
hear
me
complaining
i
taste
citrus
sweetes
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
and
get
a
resonant
pine
bitterness
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
an
apa
mediumlight
body
with
carbonation
enough
to
liven
the
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
its
unfortunate
this
isnt
sold
out
here
in
oregonwashington
zombie
dust
has
set
the
bar
for
apas
the
citra
hop
aroma
and
flavor
profile
is
unmatched
tropical
fruity
bitter
and
balanced
to
near
perfection
world
class
stuff
and
a
must
try
overall
world
class
is
exactly
what
this
beer
is
dont
know
if
apa
is
the
best
label
for
it
but
fff
delivers
on
all
levels
with
zombie
dust
will
definitely
seek
again
excellent
beer
all
around
and
worthy
of
the
praise
o
a
very
strong
pale
ale
fits
style
well
a
little
hoppier
than
expected
but
im
learning
3floyds
tend
to
roll
that
way
glad
i
got
a
six
pack
at
the
brewpub
will
definetly
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
o
many
american
pale
ales
straddle
the
thin
line
between
apaipa
to
me
this
beer
has
crossed
over
and
sits
pretty
firmly
in
ipa
territory
not
that
im
complaining
though
they
can
call
it
whatever
they
want
as
long
as
its
still
a
damn
good
beer
very
high
marks
for
this
one
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
seek
it
out
and
drink
it
o
after
trying
a
3
month
old
version
this
less
than
a
month
old
version
is
beautiful
though
the
taste
could
still
be
improved
pours
a
lovely
golden
orange
color
with
a
touch
of
copper
medium
cap
of
bubbly
white
froth
good
sticky
lacing
bright
but
lightly
hazed
scent
brings
big
whiffs
of
pungent
grapefruit
some
pine
resin
and
a
good
blend
of
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
mouthwatering
lightly
sugary
sweet
and
modest
detection
of
light
caramelized
malts
taste
is
not
as
bold
or
as
devastating
as
the
scent
had
me
fearing
but
this
is
a
pale
ale
strong
bitter
grapefruit
notes
followed
by
more
citrus
and
tropical
notes
fruits
come
across
as
more
rind
than
juice
sweet
in
a
juicy
way
with
a
touch
of
lightly
caramelized
malts
bitter
lightly
drying
on
the
palate
good
body
overall
a
very
enjoyable
apa
with
strong
flavor
and
scent
notes
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
but
not
the
best
my
first
beer
purchase
on
ebay
and
man
was
it
worth
it
a
dark
gold
pour
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
resinious
citrus
hop
smell
hits
you
immediately
flavor
is
grapefruit
mango
and
lemons
very
tasty
brew
with
the
enough
malt
to
round
it
out
would
love
to
have
at
my
disposal
overall
best
apa
ive
had
if
the
bitterness
were
a
bit
more
dominant
theres
enough
hop
flavor
to
push
the
ipa
envelope
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
pineapple
and
apricot
notes
as
well
as
some
bread
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
i
get
a
ton
of
hop
characteristics
including
a
lot
of
pine
orange
and
resin
notes
there
is
also
a
good
bit
of
bread
and
biscuit
malt
and
the
bitterness
level
is
low
to
medium
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
great
beer
wish
it
was
distributed
locally
o
very
good
pale
ale
but
just
a
touch
too
grassy
upfront
for
me
cpolking
comes
through
big
time
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
brownish
orange
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
tropical
fruits
hops
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
fruits
citrisy
hoppy
some
bitterness
a
good
malt
balance
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
top
notch
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
stuff
is
great
right
down
the
line
i
wish
i
had
this
sort
of
brew
to
put
in
my
regular
rotation
around
here
for
now
im
going
to
thank
the
most
awesome
rutager
for
sending
me
a
bottle
o
so
glad
i
finally
got
a
hold
of
some
of
this
one
very
complex
pale
ale
i
wish
this
was
available
locally
overall
really
enjoyable
love
the
hops
this
is
the
most
wonderful
glass
of
beer
i
have
ever
enjoyed
everything
thing
about
it
is
perfect
nice
smell
of
hops
and
citrus
but
nothing
too
overpowering
hops
are
very
flowery
and
crisp
with
notes
of
grass
and
caramel
completely
wellbalanced
here
in
chicago
it
is
hard
to
find
sixpacks
even
at
topnotch
bars
its
full
of
hop
character
but
light
and
not
boozy
its
big
but
its
true
to
a
pale
ale
root
even
at
6
2
it
has
a
light
sessionable
very
low
sensing
abv
quality
it
is
stupidly
drinkable
i
could
go
through
this
six
pack
i
swear
with
joy
in
under
an
hour
but
i
must
control
myself
just
flat
out
amazing
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
most
of
the
flavors
come
from
hops
but
somehow
this
is
not
overly
hoppy
just
delicious
mouthfeel
really
nice
well
carbed
but
not
prickly
insanely
drinkable
easy
to
see
what
all
the
fuzz
is
about
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
only
had
one
bottle
to
try
great
smell
of
hops
and
citrus
nice
one
finger
head
that
lasted
taste
like
heaven
in
a
bottle
had
a
surly
furious
the
other
day
and
this
one
ranks
just
as
well
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
great
tasting
pale
ale
o
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
very
much
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
if
i
had
to
choose
one
beer
that
i
would
have
everyday
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
o
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
deserves
this
incredible
ranking
if
i
were
stuck
on
a
desert
island
and
had
one
beer
to
drink
forever
this
would
be
it
period
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
there
is
nothing
lacking
in
this
beer
and
im
just
blown
away
at
how
the
hops
fit
perfectly
the
aromatics
on
this
beer
are
staggering
simply
nothing
else
like
it
every
citrus
fruit
you
can
imagine
and
a
bit
of
pineapple
nice
sticky
lacing
as
well
taste
is
phenomenal
love
this
on
tap
really
pleased
the
bottle
holds
up
just
as
well
a
very
light
flavorful
pale
ale
but
without
the
bitterness
of
most
ipas
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
planted
firmly
between
typical
ipas
and
typical
apas
i
like
it
it
does
the
same
disappearing
act
that
gumballhead
does
where
the
beer
simply
vanishes
from
my
mouth
leaving
little
trace
of
its
passing
goes
down
easy
like
a
pale
ale
should
smooth
moderately
carbonated
and
refreshing
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
am
lucky
to
live
45
minutes
from
the
brewery
as
this
is
difficult
to
find
8
75
per
sixer
at
the
brewpub
and
twice
the
price
at
local
stores
when
you
can
find
it
overall
there
is
nothing
i
dont
love
about
this
beer
call
me
a
fanboy
if
put
on
a
desert
island
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
not
overly
light
as
to
feel
like
water
but
not
so
heavy
as
to
feel
weighed
down
its
the
perfect
balance
and
could
only
dream
of
having
this
offered
down
the
street
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
one
resembles
gumballhead
i
did
not
have
sidebyside
but
on
different
days
the
bitterness
and
the
lacking
malt
to
support
it
are
what
make
these
beers
good
to
try
but
not
must
haves
to
acquire
again
overall
very
nice
ipa
wait
apa
okay
anyways
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
that
recede
to
a
nice
tight
white
cap
as
is
expected
tons
of
citra
hops
on
the
nose
really
bright
citrus
fruits
and
just
a
touch
of
dankness
no
real
malt
presence
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
tons
of
hops
all
over
the
place
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bitterness
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
could
have
easily
downed
a
6
pack
if
i
had
it
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
just
a
touch
more
maltiness
on
the
taste
to
balance
out
the
hops
as
it
is
it
came
off
just
a
bit
harsh
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
hophead
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
arrives
a
pale
orange
color
mostly
clear
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
an
explosion
of
citra
hops
in
your
face
awesome
a
large
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
character
with
a
hint
of
pine
couldnt
possibly
be
better
the
flavor
follows
suit
terrific
its
hard
to
think
this
isnt
an
ipa
with
the
hop
character
again
the
citra
hops
explode
on
your
palette
medium
bitter
with
a
large
tropical
fruit
mango
grapefruit
pine
tone
again
i
am
not
sure
how
this
could
improve
the
light
malt
base
provides
enough
sweetness
to
balance
this
out
well
finishes
with
a
lingering
citrus
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
more
and
more
and
more
highly
recommended
othis
is
my
first
solo
fff
offering
besides
a
few
of
their
collaborations
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
i
want
this
beer
all
the
time
and
am
jealous
of
everyone
that
can
i
will
trade
for
this
whenever
possible
or
i
could
just
move
there
awesome
beer
o
probably
a
new
favorite
pale
i
even
love
the
taste
of
my
beer
burps
met
my
high
expectations
o
probably
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
although
i
feel
like
3f
is
stretching
the
category
a
bit
as
its
pretty
much
an
ipa
having
a
fresh
bottle
certainly
renewed
my
faith
in
the
citra
hop
o
this
is
a
stellar
beer
i
loved
it
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
i
still
love
it
today
i
think
it
actually
gets
way
better
as
it
warms
a
great
apa
all
the
way
around
cheers
to
fff
if
you
have
a
favorite
ipa
or
a
favorite
pa
you
have
to
give
this
a
shot
and
by
the
way
its
ok
to
give
it
5s
across
the
board
i
think
this
should
be
the
benchmark
o
its
hard
to
look
at
you
and
say
you
arent
perfect
im
not
entirely
sure
this
is
what
an
american
pale
ale
is
supposed
to
taste
like
either
though
this
is
a
good
citra
forward
apaipa
not
much
else
to
say
verdict
massive
triumph
from
three
floyds
i
dont
think
there
is
a
better
pale
ale
in
the
world
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
a
strong
double
ipa
while
having
almost
none
of
the
bitterness
or
alcohol
and
remains
exceptionally
drinkable
this
is
one
to
stock
up
on
whenever
it
gets
released
which
is
not
often
enough
d
very
drinkable
really
great
hop
profile
for
an
apa
the
citrus
flavors
are
nice
and
strong
throughout
and
have
some
good
complexity
overall
delicious
its
an
ipa
really
who
are
we
kidding
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
ipas
too
the
best
pale
ale
by
far
sorry
peeper
big
thanks
to
rutager
o
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
is
one
of
the
finest
apa
or
ipa
if
you
want
to
make
that
argument
in
all
the
land
powerful
citrus
aromas
and
a
great
grapefruit
flavor
undoubtedly
from
all
of
those
citrus
hops
if
this
were
available
in
my
area
it
would
unquestionably
be
my
goto
hopfix
midabv
beer
a
place
currently
reserved
for
perpetual
ipa
and
evo
lot
no
3
ipa
you
dont
need
me
to
recommend
it
to
know
you
shoudl
drink
this
if
you
can
get
it
love
it
overall
a
winsome
hop
character
for
a
very
nice
apa
this
is
easily
my
new
favorite
apa
the
nose
is
definitely
the
high
point
for
me
but
its
really
just
all
around
great
highly
recommended
o
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
its
an
apa
on
the
verge
of
being
an
ipa
low
abv
with
complex
but
balanced
characteristics
crisp
and
refreshing
a
showcase
for
citra
hops
and
wellcrafted
ale
well
above
the
norm
overall
what
a
nice
surprise
this
was
beers
like
this
are
why
i
dont
need
session
beers
only
2
more
abv
but
busting
at
the
seems
with
flavor
another
great
offering
from
fff
5
this
is
why
i
drink
beer
o
one
of
the
best
apas
i
have
ever
had
period
o
yeah
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
want
more
o
to
have
this
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
in
a
standard
apaipa
is
really
outstanding
would
i
trade
my
cellar
for
this
stuff
absolutely
not
however
i
would
never
turn
one
down
this
is
a
great
beer
o
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
that
disappears
from
the
glass
delicious
and
very
very
drinkable
fff
might
have
just
redefined
the
style
here
get
it
if
you
can
o
an
awesome
beer
easily
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
super
drinkable
this
is
a
hop
heads
perfect
beer
o
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
o
really
nice
and
drinkable
enjoyable
and
refreshing
probably
not
my
absolute
favorite
for
an
apa
but
right
up
there
definitely
a
good
pale
ale
thanks

off

with
nice
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin

some
decent

on
the

aromas
of
huge
mango
pineapple
grapefruit
tangerine
light

taste

and
herbal

nice
amount

on

with
lingering
notes

herbal
and
tropical

for
a
bit
great

balance
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
medium

with
a
nice
slightly
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
noticed
at
all
in
the
taste
or
finish
overall
this
is
an
mind
blowing
pale
ale
tons
of
great
hop
flavor
and
balance
you
would
think
this
was
an
ipa
o
really
enjoying
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
intense
aroma
and
taste
but
easily
drinkable
if
i
had
more
than
this
one
bottle
id
happily
pop
open
another
o
its
definitely
a
good
apa
and
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
disagree
that
its
the
best
in
class
however
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
flavorwise
coming
off
kbs
day
perhaps
my
pallate
has
gotten
a
little
spoiled
ill
come
back
to
this
review
over
the
next
four
bottles
i
have
overall
this
is
the
finest
apa
on
the
planet
no
gripes
here
o
the
smell
didnt
win
me
over
all
that
much
smelled
like
a
standard
ipa
and
then
i
tasted
the
delightfulness
that
is
zombie
dust
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
hot
days
like
today
great
flavor
great
mouthfeel
pours
a
ruddy
orange
with
a
dense
white
head
the
smell
is
sharp
and
tangy
with
a
lot
of
meyer
lemon
notes
as
well
as
something
herbal
and
something
a
little
bready
as
well
the
taste
is
again
heavy
on
the
citrus
tang
with
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
to
keep
things
balanced
its
highly
carbonated
but
very
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
totally
blown
away
by
this
beer
fantastic
clarity
with
a
golden
orange
glow
outstanding
balance
of
sweetness
and
dryness
with
a
pungent
and
puckering
grapefruit
hops
kick
that
is
assertive
yet
not
overpowering
some
malt
sweetness
creeps
in
toward
the
finish
very
clean
drinks
much
much
bigger
than
6
2
abv
this
ranks
in
my
top
favorite
beers
poured
cool
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
a
yellowbrown
color
clear
with
a
healthy
white
cover
that
settles
to
a
stubborn
thin
blanket
lacing
is
equally
stalwart
the
bouquet
of
citrus
hops
is
instantly
delivered
upon
opening
the
bottle
floral
biscuit
near
cherry
blossoms
over
delicate
grain
very
nice
and
such
a
pleasure
when
risking
the
often
too
tame
genre
of
pale
ales
the
flavor
brings
an
interesting
combination
of
floral
grain
with
a
grassy
finish
after
the
tongue
has
a
couple
moments
to
contemplate
this
you
get
more
of
the
citrus
back
and
it
ultimately
presents
a
fine
sweet
but
reasonably
balanced
hop
refreshment
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
near
slick
feel
and
fairly
delicate
carbonation
that
crescendos
to
a
mild
froth
in
your
mouth
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
entry
for
the
pale
ale
world
i
knew
there
was
a
reason
i
was
determined
to
bring
home
some
three
floyds
with
me
from
chicago
last
week
a
great
beer
but
voraciously
overhyped
overall
doesnt
hurt
that
i
picked
up
this
bottle
at
the
brewpub
today
so
it
is
super
fresh
just
about
the
best
thing
i
have
ever
tasted
that
has
emerged
from
a
fermenter
o
a
beautiful
pale
ale
that
is
for
sure
and
i
wish
that
all
my
beers
this
summer
would
taste
the
same
overall
an
excellent
beer
hops
are
very
aromatic
but
not
overwhelming
in
the
taste
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
as
much
flavour
packed
into
a
6
2
drop
as
many
ipas
pack
into
9
massive
drinkabilty
an
impressive
coup
o
very
good
pale
ale
really
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
more
hop
flavor
cheers
moving
to
an
always
want
overall
wow
an
outstanding
pale
pale
ale
that
i
would
definitely
stack
up
against
any
standard
ipa
and
quite
a
few
dipas
there
really
isnt
anything
pale
about
this
brew
bravo
fff
this
beer
is
incredible
drinkable
every
day
without
getting
boring
but
awesome
enough
to
be
a
special
occasion
brew
i
will
absolutely
seek
this
beer
out
again
and
highly
recommend
that
you
do
as
well
this
is
a
very
special
beer
this
is
easily
the
best
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
could
easily
hold
its
own
against
some
outstanding
ipas
as
well
it
is
hoppy
and
complex
enough
for
a
seasoned
craft
beer
drinker
which
i
still
aspire
to
be
yet
easydrinking
and
accessible
enough
for
a
more
casual
drinker
i
think
its
a
nearly
perfect
apa
and
an
absolute
masterpiece
of
a
beer
i
wish
we
could
buy
it
here
its
not
going
to
be
one
of
my
favourites
as
im
much
more
of
a
fan
of
malts
than
hops
but
its
a
really
good
beer
o
this
really
is
remarkable
it
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
the
limits
brewers
will
push
ive
been
assaulted
by
citra
yet
my
palate
is
fried
for
the
night
m
medium
body
slightly
creamy
light
to
moderate
carbonation
resiny
palate
through
and
through
this
citric
flavor
bomb
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
worth
drinking
a
few
at
a
time
but
not
too
many
for
me
my
palate
would
be
overwhelmed
with
citrus
for
weeks
an
intense
hop
experience
it
is
good
but
not
great
as
expectations
led
me
to
believe
i
like
my
pale
ales
just
a
little
more
balanced
than
this
but
it
sure
was
fun
to
try
overall
wow
if
i
have
a
better
beer
in
2012
then
i
will
be
a
lucky
man
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
pale
ale
style
for
me
id
rather
drink
this
than
any
india
pale
ale
the
only
hoppy
beer
that
i
would
reach
for
before
this
that
ive
had
honestly
is
pliny
the
elder
zombie
dust
absolutely
brings
iipa
flavor
into
the
best
malt
package
possible
for
my
palate
this
is
a
dream
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
wish
i
could
drink
this
every
day
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
fantastic
with
huge
tropical
fruit
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
also
very
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
forward
with
a
citrus
zest
finish
the
bitterness
on
the
palate
is
fairly
mild
and
sticks
around
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
simply
a
fantastic
beer
that
beautifully
displays
the
citra
hops
in
aroma
and
flavor
i
am
very
happy
that
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
would
consider
buying
again
and
again
if
it
was
distributed
near
me
o
this
is
the
best
apaipa
ive
ever
had
ive
had
better
dipas
and
i
really
dont
like
to
give
out
perfect
5s
which
is
why
this
is
staying
below
that
level
for
the
style
which
is
very
key
here
it
is
mindblowing
to
get
a
better
hop
forward
beer
than
this
in
my
opinion
youd
need
to
have
a
top
notch
dipa
like
heady
topper
pte
or
another
fff
brew
dreadnaught
its
really
some
spectacular
stuff
i
really
wasnt
expecting
an
apa
to
be
this
great
but
im
so
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
receive
this
in
a
trade
its
too
bad
i
only
have
a
few
left
because
id
drink
this
all
the
time
gets
a
5
overall
because
i
think
for
the
style
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
received
a
bottle
in
trade
from
dabubs
and
one
from
dwbrews
thanks
guys
bright
orange
color
a
little
lace
this
had
a
not
bad
a
very
hoppy
smell
like
fruit
smelled
good
flavor
was
more
hops
fuzzy
peaches
actually
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
an
ipa
but
i
would
say
it
was
very
one
dimensional
and
so
i
probably
wouldnt
revisit
it
still
i
was
very
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
for
an
apa
this
is
a
good
beer
on
the
other
hand
it
amazes
me
the
way
this
beer
is
impossible
for
many
people
to
find
as
far
as
being
an
apa
there
is
nothing
particularly
unique
or
special
it
is
a
little
above
average
i
like
dales
pale
ale
an
daisy
cutter
but
this
one
just
has
an
extra
edge
of
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
complex
flavor
to
make
it
unique
in
this
style
overall
an
excellant
example
of
the
style
and
one
im
happy
to
review
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
was
with
heady
topper
and
abner
so
my
tastebuds
were
fried
and
didnt
give
it
a
fair
shake
if
you
dig
citra
hops
than
this
ones
for
you
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
apas
to
date
nice
job
o
this
was
really
frickn
good
i
could
drink
this
anytime
but
id
love
to
have
a
nice
stash
of
it
for
the
summer
cheers
if
this
were
available
to
me
yearround
id
always
have
some
on
hand
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
three
floyds
only
produces
a
limited
amount
and
the
supply
frequently
gets
exhausted
so
if
you
see
it
buy
it
it
gets
sold
out
all
the
time
for
good
reason
best
beer
ever
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
arguabley
will
ever
have
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
this
style
seems
to
fall
by
the
wayside
these
days
as
ipa
is
quite
similar
to
apa
and
also
seems
quite
fashionable
this
apa
as
well
as
the
floyds
flagship
brew
are
both
spectacular
examples
of
how
uniquely
the
style
can
be
expressed
to
show
contrast
to
the
ipa
and
in
quite
delicious
fashion
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
dance
with
this
one
d
this
is
what
an
apa
should
taste
like
smooth
malt
flavor
and
heavy
citrus
hop
overtones
what
more
could
you
ask
for
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
great
full
flavors
and
aroma
profile
while
a
pale
ale
it
is
not
because
in
my
opinion
a
pale
ale
shouldnt
be
over
6
abv
it
is
a
great
ipa
or
just
a
great
beer
in
general
dangerously
drinkable
and
full
flavored
glad
i
was
able
to
track
down
a
6pack
for
myself
do
i
need
to
have
it
again
no
do
i
hope
i
have
the
chance
yes
of
course
definitely
recommended
though
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
but
not
the
best
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
on
tap
before
giving
final
judgement
though
as
the
aromas
and
flavors
seem
to
indicate
the
possibility
of
greatness
pours
a
nice
orange
color
in
my
tulip
glass
with
an
off
white
head
good
lacing
on
my
glass
the
nose
has
a
very
nice
citrus
vibe
to
it
along
with
caramel
malt
amazing
taste
to
this
brew
hops
pine
w
a
nice
malt
backbone
really
incredible
flavor
for
a
pale
ale
feel
is
medium
w
a
nice
hops
bite
overall
an
another
amazing
fff
brew
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
yellow
straw
with
foam
which
falls
rather
quickly
to
a
mirror
of
the
same
smells
like
citra
grapefruit
citrus
more
citrus
not
at
all
this
smells
like
band
aids
and
onions
wow
god
awful
then
the
flavor
is
brutalized
as
well
bitter
astringent
nasty
body
is
fine
beyond
my
clinching
jaw
this
beer
is
ruined
for
me
wtf
happened
to
this
bottle
thanks
rfraga77
you
as
always
are
the
man
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
there
is
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
this
beer
finishes
dry
a
very
good
pale
ale
which
i
recommend
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
4
5
im
the
first
to
admit
that
i
am
a
three
floyds
junkie
but
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
1010
o
i
first
enjoyed
this
beer
at
dld
2011
and
was
blown
away
todate
i
continue
to
be
amazed
at
how
simply
awesome
it
is
so
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
not
too
overpowering
in
any
aspects
but
articulate
allaround
bravo
three
floyds
on
another
great
beer
overall
this
is
my
stranded
on
an
island
beer
for
sure
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
nuff
said
o
was
worried
with
the
hype
behind
this
beer
i
wouldnt
be
as
impressed
as
others
though
i
was
wrong
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
sampled
on
tap
at
the
3
floyds
pub
in
313
this
beer
was
every
bit
as
good
on
tap
and
as
with
the
bottled
version
is
a
beer
i
would
order
all
the
time
if
it
were
only
available
where
i
live
o
awesome
pale
ale
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
enjoyed
on
tap
at
hopleaf
in
chicago
february
9
looked
like
almost
everyone
in
the
bar
was
enjoying
it
as
well
pours
a
deep
amber
with
great
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
pine
and
intense
citrus
grapefruit
mango
lemon
are
all
there
to
overwhelm
the
olfactory
taste
is
full
of
juicy
fruity
and
piney
hops
with
a
substantial
malty
backdrop
mouthfeel
is
resinous
and
sticky
with
dry
finish
as
noted
elsewhere
a
beer
of
this
description
seems
like
it
should
be
classified
as
an
ipa
whatever
you
call
it
though
it
is
magically
delicious
o
this
beer
is
a
revelation
i
went
into
this
beer
thinking
itd
just
be
an
ipa
with
an
apa
label
on
it
i
was
wrong
it
is
very
much
an
apa
with
a
more
hopforward
profile
but
retaining
not
only
a
balance
with
the
malt
but
also
a
strong
and
flavorful
malt
presence
overall
overall
not
really
sure
why
you
cant
call
this
one
an
ipa
in
any
case
this
is
one
of
the
best
selfdescribed
apas
i
can
remember
drinking
totally
drinkable
flavorful
hop
profile
and
thirstquenching
overall
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
more
please
no
doubt
about
it
the
mouth
feel
is
big
its
sticky
viscous
and
chewy
carbonation
is
mild
and
the
finish
isnt
as
dry
as
many
its
considered
a
pale
ale
but
drink
it
fresh
and
youll
consider
it
delicious
its
nearly
as
ominous
as
its
label
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
really
really
with
three
floyds
would
come
to
ma
so
i
can
drink
this
stuff
weekly
the
cimmerian
sabertooth
berserker
of
the
apa
world
3floyds
does
things
with
hops
that
is
just
on
a
completely
different
level
and
theyve
struck
gold
again
with
zombie
dust
pours
a
chilled
golden
orange
with
a
slow
stream
of
carbonation
supporting
an
initially
thick
cream
head
fades
to
a
thin
layer
with
extensive
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
is
green
fresh
and
raw
citrus
rind
grapefruit
pulp
mild
pine
and
light
caramel
malt
not
quite
as
aromatic
as
some
of
the
hf
apas
but
very
well
balanced
and
nuanced
medium
thick
chewy
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
wet
thin
finish
strong
biscuit
malt
and
earthy
body
with
resiny
and
pulpy
citrus
hops
buttering
the
finish
an
exceptional
citrusy
apa
but
a
little
too
much
alcohol
presence
for
the
style
and
not
quite
hoppy
birthday
or
edward
regardless
i
will
seek
this
out
every
time
it
is
released
thanks

pours
a
clear
darker
shade
of
goldorange
with
a
sparse
head
nose
is
juicy
citrus
pulp
grapefruit
rind
light
pine
resin
takes
the
really
juicy
hop
qualities
of
dreadnaught
and
alpha
king
dialed
down
a
bit
but
still
honed
in
mouth
is
sharply
bitter
throughout
super
brightly
hopped
washes
of
grapefruit
rind
with
some
nice
malt
underneath
dry
and
bitter
but
complex
with
really
pleasant
citrus
tones
takes
me
back
to
the
days
when
i
could
actually
get
three
floyds
ipas
need
more
of
this
o
wow
this
is
probably
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
i
was
expecting
something
à
la
sierra
nevada
which
i
like
but
this
is
so
much
better
very
well
balanced
between
hop
and
malt
very
approachable
and
not
overly
bitter
would
be
a
great
intro
to
craft
beer
as
well
as
a
special
treat
for
the
seasoned
ba
highly
recommend
this
is
my
first
experience
with
three
floyds
and
damn
im
impressed
o
fantastic
apa
from
fff
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
may
very
well
leave
alpha
king
in
the
dust
with
this
one
great
pale
ale
that
drinks
very
similar
to
an
ipa
phenomenal
treat
yourself
not
quite
as
good
as
hoppy
birthday
or
parking
violation
but
this
is
very
very
close
exceptional
especially
when
this
fresh
highly
recommended
overall
superb
among
the
very
best
if
not
the
best
apa
out
there
i
was
wondering
if
someone
would
be
able
to
pull
off
such
a
bold
apa
but
three
floyds
did
simply
delicious
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
chance
to
drink
my
new
favorite
fff
beer
taking
alpha
kings
spot
reminded
me
of
a
single
american
ipa
but
not
overly
hoppy
one
of
the
best
of
all
time
mouthfeel
creamy
full
astringent
no
alcohol
heat
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
didnt
really
find
anything
too
incredibly
special
about
it
i
enjoy
most
of
the
beers
this
brewery
puts
out
but
all
the
hype
ive
heard
about
zombie
dust
just
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
cheers
o
top
notch
apa
loved
it
o
the
american
ipa
best
of
class
done
three
floyds
strength
seems
to
be
in
the
ipa
realm
and
this
is
yet
another
jewel
in
their
crown
as
one
of
the
kings
of
midwest
ipa
power
o
i
fing
love
this
beer
i
wish
3
floyds
was
distributed
on
the
west
coast
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
tangy
and
sweet
not
as
much
like
a
normal
ipa
but
still
very
goo
i
would
suggest
everyone
try
this
at
least
once
d
the
sweet
but
delicate
flavors
combined
with
great
smell
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
one
of
my
new
favorite
ipas
or
pale
ales
super
drinkable
and
doesnt
leave
much
room
for
improvement
overall
a
delicious
beer
that
has
a
fantastic
balance
of
flavours
it
really
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
apa
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
better
made
flying
monkeys
smashbomb
ipa
worth
seeking
out
and
id
drink
it
again
anytime
overall
an
instant
favorite
its
one
of
those
beers
that
give
you
an
involuntaryuncontrollable
smile
with
the
first
taste
its
flavor
is
super
complex
for
the
super
beer
geek
but
subtledelicate
enough
to
be
enjoyed
by
any
beer
drinker
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
because
i
would
buy
a
keg
this
beer
leaves
all
others
apas
in
its
dust
dust
get
it
its
actually
very
balanced
a
sticky
honey
malt
is
highlighted
by
a
good
bit
of
fruity
hops
grapefruit
lemon
zest
and
nice
touch
of
orange
peel
a
nice
bittering
presence
is
actually
a
lot
less
than
the
nose
leads
you
to
believe
but
thats
actually
a
very
good
thing
slightly
metallic
sits
very
light
and
all
the
flavors
fade
away
leaving
the
hints
of
bitter
and
metal
ogoing
according
to
style
i
find
it
to
be
much
more
hop
centered
than
an
apa
but
as
an
ipa
i
would
rate
higher
overall
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
well
balanced
fairly
complex
the
citrushop
notes
are
very
fresh
very
high
drinkability
o
superb
no
other
way
to
describe
it
a
sublime
example
of
citra
hops
that
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
highly
recommended
and
and
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
beer
year
round
phenomenal
o
now
i
see
what
all
the
hypes
about
one
of
my
new
top
5
ipas
for
sure
definitely
cannot
improve
anymore
o
fantastic
my
favorite
apa
love
it
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
releases
over
the
past
several
years
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
beyond
most
highly
recommend
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
got
from
ummagum
many
thanks
rotation
if
available
near
me
it
would
be
a
constant
presence
in
my
fridge
and
probably
would
get
a
keg
if
available
hy
mouthfeel
is
great
easy
drinking
i
really
wish
this
was
distributed
overall
this
is
simply
outstanding
believe
the
hype
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
new
to
the
review
thing
so
this
wont
be
overwrought
thanks
to
tsauce2
for
the
extra
thrown
in
with
a
trade
possibly
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
citra
hops
very
fruity
nose
and
taste
with
almost
no
hop
bitterness
lovely
fruity
hop
flavor
didnt
even
know
how
much
of
a
gem
this
one
is
until
the
first
scent
of
the
aroma
phenomenal
overall
a
great
apa
from
a
world
class
brewery
cheers
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
lots
of
grapefruit
and
hops
with
little
accompaning
bitterness
and
a
suprisingly
dry
finish
very
happy
i
tried
this
beer
overall
great
beer
i
would
drink
this
throughout
summer
if
i
lived
near
fff
one
thing
though
why
do
fff
bottle
their
huge
ipas
like
apocalypse
cow
in
bombers
and
their
refreshing
pale
ale
in
a
355ml
overall
yup
hype
is
on
point
tons
of
flavor
but
nothing
overbearing
surprisingly
balanced
and
incredibly
drinkable
also
citra
singlehop
has
to
be
once
of
the
best
ideas
on
the
market
bonus
points
overall
an
outstanding
beer
overall
a
great
example
of
an
ipa
with
a
little
extra
kick
of
pepper
or
something
i
will
have
to
get
some
more
to
try
to
pin
point
the
unigue
taste
of
this
beer
that
seperates
it
from
the
rest
overall
a
phenomenal
display
of
what
a
pale
ale
can
be
like
with
the
citra
hop
a
softer
touch
to
it
than
the
sn
torpedo
citra
or
kern
river
much
less
in
the
malt
department
to
let
it
stand
out
it
just
has
a
more
flowery
and
delicate
aura
to
it
here
big
points
for
keeping
the
bitterness
down
and
the
hop
mouthfeel
very
high
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
an
apricot
golden
orange
hue
with
a
bright
chunky
head
just
barely
off
white
in
color
fine
even
lacing
lines
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dwindles
down
aroma
has
a
super
citrus
grapefruit
nose
hints
of
crushed
aspirin
tropical
fruit
with
a
underlying
biscuit
malt
character
flavor
is
crazy
with
citra
hops
bringing
out
tropical
fruit
marmalade
its
pretty
awesome
nothing
else
like
this
creates
the
same
flavor
bitter
citrus
peel
pineapple
notes
and
a
mellow
biscuit
malt
sweetness
matches
the
bitterness
i
keep
getting
a
really
green
peppermint
tone
in
both
the
nose
and
the
flavor
crazy
but
it
works
with
the
beers
flavor
the
palate
is
coated
with
hop
oils
ample
carbonation
rolls
everything
perfectly
across
with
each
sip
overall
a
classic
pale
ale
that
could
be
most
breweries
ipa
really
unleashes
the
perfect
wave
of
citra
hops
equating
into
a
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
we
all
wish
was
more
readily
available
thanks
to
the
great
trader
ryan
aka
schlais
out
of
minnesota
for
this
early
christmas
gift
golden
yellow
solid
white
head
lots
of
tropical
fruit
very
fragrant
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
pineapple
mango
grapefruit
carbonation
is
smooth
solid
easy
drinking
american
pale
i
had
no
problem
putting
away
several
pints
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
apa
this
is
right
up
there
with
dreadnaught
in
my
favorite
fff
beers
good
beer
but
heavy
in
the
grapefruit
department
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
aroma
is
hop
malt
fresh
cut
grass
wet
grain
caramel
flavors
the
same
along
with
carbonic
tang
that
accents
the
hop
finish
is
like
flavor
has
lots
of
length
and
is
satisfying
good
stuff
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
two
finger
head
nice
lacing
good
looking
beer
aroma
of
citra
hops
citrus
fruits
especially
grapefruit
taste
follows
nose
malts
present
to
back
up
hop
bitterness
but
still
allow
the
hops
to
shine
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
little
alcohol
presence
pours
a
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
whitish
1
14
finger
head
the
smell
is
amazing
nice
floral
hoppy
smell
thats
very
clean
i
smell
a
slight
grape
in
the
background
very
nice
very
nice
mouth
feel
with
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
not
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
would
love
to
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
o
hard
to
describe
this
one
its
not
a
super
hoppy
dipa
or
a
big
roasty
ris
its
just
right
it
has
to
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
just
smooth
clean
with
some
nice
citrus
and
enough
malt
backbone
to
balance
it
out
i
thought
alpha
king
was
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
but
i
think
fff
has
broken
their
own
highwater
mark
o
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
were
it
readily
available
just
an
outstanding
apa
from
start
to
finish
so
packed
with
flavor
at
a
relatively
low
6
2
the
interplay
between
sweet
citrus
and
bitter
resin
plays
out
very
nicely
just
fantastic
awesome
beer
all
i
can
really
say
is
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
you
really
should
it
is
probably
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
overall
i
prefer
this
to
a
sn
pale
ale
as
my
favorite
the
only
drawback
is
it
is
not
as
widely
available
as
the
sn
i
highly
recommend
seeking
this
out
o
very
nice
hoppy
beer
more
like
an
ipa
delicious
though
overall
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
its
nice
to
have
a
rare
top
50
beer
thats
reasonably
priced
too
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
thanks
again
to
kalvarez
for
the
trade
will
be
happily
drinking
this
over
the
next
2
weeks
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
displays
great
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
citrus
pine
and
resin
mostly
with
hints
of
green
onion
and
garlic
if
there
is
malt
in
here
i
cant
find
it
taste
is
citrus
pine
resin
and
green
onion
with
maybe
some
bits
of
bready
malt
if
i
squint
a
bit
long
lingering
onion
hop
bite
in
the
finish
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sharp
resinous
mouthfeel
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
brew
but
to
call
this
a
pale
ale
is
quite
a
stretch
we
could
safely
call
this
an
ipa
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
ipa
overall
this
is
one
of
the
top
apas
ive
had
it
walks
the
line
between
an
apa
and
an
ipa
very
well
and
for
as
wonderfully
hoppy
as
it
smells
and
tastes
i
dont
know
that
it
can
be
beat
good
reason
why
its
the
number
1
rated
apa
at
the
moment
had
again
recently
and
i
had
to
up
my
score
from
4
0
to
4
5
its
just
that
damn
good
though
i
think
i
prefer
alpha
king
just
slightly
to
zd
its
still
wonderful
ozombie
dust
is
an
awesome
beer
great
art
good
price
and
tastes
nice
it
is
probably
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
but
i
found
the
bitterness
to
be
overly
accentuated
just
as
good
on
tap
5
months
later
at
the
maproom
is
this
really
a
pale
ale
well
im
blown
away
i
initially
reviewed
this
assuming
that
it
was
an
ipa
and
the
hop
profile
certainly
reflects
that
this
is
by
far
the
hoppiest
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
and
im
sure
it
would
be
bombastic
on
tap
a
must
try
o
very
good
beer
to
drink
i
wish
i
could
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
anytime
the
one
bottle
left
me
wanting
more
hope
they
start
making
more
and
distribute
it
thanks
evan
for
the
beer
o
i
really
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
or
from
a
growler
perhaps
when
i
visit
chicago
in
a
few
days
ill
get
my
chance
nearly
flawless
overall
this
is
much
more
hopped
than
i
would
expect
an
apa
to
be
i
think
this
is
more
aptly
labled
an
ipa
regardless
of
how
its
labeled
however
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
that
deserves
recognition
make
any
and
all
efforts
to
acquire
this
one
if
you
enjoy
hops
overall
despite
the
pathetic
excuse
for
a
head
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
definitely
not
a
huge
fan
of
citra
hops
but
the
malt
base
was
strong
enough
to
keep
the
soapy
notes
that
citra
hops
are
so
well
known
for
in
check
obviously
not
worth
all
the
exaggerated
press
it
gets
on
here
but
one
to
check
out
if
you
get
the
chance
would
drink
again
definitely
worth
the
3f
zomer
i
traded
for
it
thanks
again
claaark13
o
hands
down
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
i
could
go
through
cases
of
this
stuff
amazing
overall
a
world
class
pale
ale
that
brings
any
hop
lover
to
tears
amazing
o
interesting
the
aroma
is
very
enticing
but
the
citrus
hop
flavor
just
isnt
strong
enough
for
me
the
bitterness
is
there
but
i
was
hoping
to
taste
those
delicious
citrus
hop
aromas
i
smelled
this
is
a
solid
apa
for
sure
but
its
not
world
class
imo
just
got
this
in
a
trade
thanks
whitemomba
the
second
i
popped
the
cap
on
this
beer
my
nostrils
got
hit
with
a
huge
whiff
of
hops
pours
a
slightlyhazy
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
heavy
with
the
citra
hops
lovely
citra
aroma
with
a
bit
of
pine
and
somewhat
earthy
notes
taste
just
has
so
much
hoppy
goodness
going
on
its
ridiculous
i
havent
had
alpha
king
in
a
long
time
but
i
remember
thinking
the
same
thing
how
do
they
get
such
intense
hop
profile
into
a
pale
ale
great
citra
hop
flavors
with
lovely
citrus
fruit
and
just
the
slightest
hint
of
malt
not
sure
if
this
is
a
fresh
hop
ale
but
it
sure
tastes
like
one
an
allcitra
fresh
hop
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
somewhat
resiny
with
a
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
i
would
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
alpha
king
and
daisy
cutter
to
see
who
gets
crowned
supreme
pale
ale
o
a
delicious
take
on
the
style
that
drinks
really
well
flavorful
and
unique
highly
recommended
simply
amazing
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
has
a
great
mouthfeel
for
an
american
pale
ale
the
body
is
refreshing
and
easydrinking
without
being
sticky
or
coating
the
carbonation
is
only
barely
noticeable
and
is
probably
doing
more
in
the
background
than
i
can
give
it
credit
for
great
pale
ale
that
seems
more
along
the
lines
of
a
ipa
this
is
probably
the
best
apa
ive
tasted
the
citra
hops
are
certainly
the
dominant
player
and
it
works
really
well
excellent
beer
o
without
a
doubt
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
another
thumbs
up
for
3
fff
overall
this
and
dreadnaught
and
bourbonvanilla
bean
dark
lord
could
be
the
only
3
beers
i
take
to
a
desert
island
and
id
be
just
fine
i
just
love
fff
i
may
be
biased
as
they
got
me
into
craft
beer
but
they
just
know
how
to
make
beer
right
on
o
very
good
and
true
to
style
malts
and
hops
are
blended
very
well
together
and
provide
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
lot
of
hops
o
probably
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
definitely
errs
on
the
side
of
ipa
but
truly
fantastic
i
expected
this
to
lose
some
of
its
pizazz
as
im
not
sure
how
old
this
one
was
at
least
a
couple
months
but
it
didnt
truly
fantastic
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
new
belgium
glass
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
dark
golden
brew
with
a
2inch
white
head
which
lasted
lacing
was
spotty
but
lasted
throughout
the
nose
was
the
resinous
and
the
lemony
hopcentered
smell
you
would
expect
from
the
citra
the
taste
was
dry
lemon
orange
and
mango
grassiness
pine
but
there
were
tones
of
some
nice
malt
notes
and
grain
as
well
i
loved
the
healthy
carbonation
and
some
nice
bitterness
at
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
what
a
wonderful
surprise
this
beer
was
i
just
wish
i
could
get
more
o
i
consider
myself
lucky
to
have
some
good
apas
in
this
part
of
the
world
with
lc
and
stone
and
wood
pacific
ale
but
this
beer
blows
the
heck
out
of
anything
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
my
bar
has
been
daisy
cutter
and
lc
but
this
was
mind
numbing
well
balanced
and
put
together
more
taunting
was
the
logo
just
staring
at
me
and
taunting
me
with
those
eyes
all
this
from
a
single
hop
apa
sick
just
sick
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
aromatous
pale
ale
which
stays
true
to
the
pale
ale
genre
in
the
taste
d
very
nice
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
full
blown
ipa
but
the
flavor
profile
is
subtle
and
balanced
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
hands
down
the
best
beer
i
have
had
this
year
amazing
first
beer
of
the
tasting
and
we
were
proclaiming
this
as
beer
of
the
night
and
beer
of
the
year
all
in
one
hard
as
it
is
to
believe
that
there
might
be
a
better
pale
ale
than
alpha
king
on
the
market
let
alone
one
from
the
same
brewery
zombie
dust
delivers
against
all
the
hype
update
2
im
not
sure
if
this
was
me
or
fff
but
over
the
past
year
or
so
ive
not
really
been
happy
with
zd
and
ive
had
it
a
lot
the
taste
really
went
downhill
so
i
need
to
dock
this
a
few
points
for
inconsistency
shout
out
to
rc0032
for
some
of
these
first
off
the
label
art
is
sic
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
very
elequent
and
ravishing
pint
glass
shows
a
trasparent
active
orange
topped
off
with
a
soapy
1
inch
head
my
friends
head
looked
much
better
than
mine
anyway
immediately
a
rush
of
sweet
fruits
and
hop
greatness
in
the
nose
pineapples
oranges
mango
sweetness
citrus
son
fresh
hops
come
through
and
are
very
pungent
pale
biscut
malt
intertwined
the
taste
follows
the
nose
of
amazing
citrus
filled
beer
fruity
and
limp
wristed
oily
hop
feel
leaves
a
fresh
tracked
bitterness
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
smooth
and
not
very
prickly
for
the
style
overall
3
floyds
has
been
a
rollercoaster
ride
for
expectations
and
this
one
was
on
point
i
love
the
citrus
involved
and
complexity
it
brings
to
compliment
the
bitterness
well
done
3
floyds
all
the
talk
is
justified
in
my
eyes
this
one
sets
itself
apart
from
the
field
in
apas
o
really
a
great
beer
the
worst
part
about
this
beer
is
i
finished
it
way
too
quick
and
i
want
more
and
i
cannot
get
it
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
o
this
is
a
really
great
apa
thanks
to
madarab55
for
sharing
this
one
o
an
absolutely
wonderful
beer
heather
and
i
were
lucky
enough
to
have
tried
this
back
in
the
cenotaph
days
and
have
had
it
as
zombie
dust
on
draft
and
out
of
the
bottle
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
this
would
totally
be
our
go
to
if
it
wasnt
so
difficult
to
find
right
now
overall
i
wanted
this
beer
to
not
be
good
with
all
of
the
hype
this
beer
is
like
the
yankees
or
the
lakers
you
want
to
hate
them
but
all
they
do
is
win
just
like
zombie
dust
amazing
simply
amazing
an
awesome
beer
all
around
citra
hop
my
new
personal
favorite
thanks
to
this
beer
it
just
seems
to
have
every
kind
of
hop
flavor
juicy
being
the
key
word
i
like
to
use
to
describe
this
hop
definatly
super
sessionable
any
hop
head
could
easily
down
6
packs
of
this
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
white
as
snow
foamy
head
it
has
a
wonderful
hoppy
nose
with
some
citrus
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
remarkable
being
the
apa
that
it
is
taste
is
just
a
party
in
your
mouth
with
citrus
hops
sweet
and
some
kind
of
nw
woods
kinda
thing
finish
lingers
with
sweet
which
would
make
this
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
anything
from
bbq
to
fish
super
great
apa
this
coming
from
a
kid
who
grew
up
in
stl
and
cut
his
teeth
on
ab
beers
arent
they
all
the
exact
same
with
some
food
coloring
d
really
solid
apa
they
werent
stringy
on
the
hops
with
this
one
as
the
citra
really
shines
in
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
track
some
down
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
i
gave
it
a
5
on
smell
and
that
cant
be
emphasized
enough
the
citra
hop
smell
from
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
grow
citra
hops
the
taste
is
right
up
there
as
well
a
very
solid
pale
ale
from
three
floyds
and
has
probably
surpassed
alpha
king
for
me
which
is
no
small
feat
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
from
the
bottle
which
was
definitely
more
carbonated
but
what
beer
isnt
better
from
the
tap
o
my
first
fff
beer
honestly
id
drink
this
all
day
nothing
really
standoutish
about
it
but
its
so
easy
drinking
and
has
enough
flavor
that
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
by
the
case
as
a
hop
vessel
this
beer
is
all
5s
id
love
a
nice
flavorful
malt
backbone
as
exemplified
in
fresh
nebco
gold
stock
ale
to
push
it
over
the
top
but
as
is
im
pretty
in
love
with
this
beer
murky
looking
damp
pale
amber
with
some
orange
tone
half
a
finger
of
head
sticky
lacing
in
my
tulip
aroma
is
plentiful
citrus
tropical
fruits
and
some
passion
fruit
just
an
amazing
scent
the
beer
has
a
great
pale
base
but
man
does
the
hop
flavor
pop
crisp
and
citrus
like
hop
flavor
that
carries
through
the
beer
tropical
fruit
flavors
mango
pinapple
passion
fruit
the
massive
hop
presence
creates
just
a
hint
of
cloyingness
typical
pale
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
this
really
is
one
of
the
top
pales
ive
had
i
drank
this
bottle
while
watching
one
of
the
penultimate
episodes
of
the
most
recent
season
of
breaking
bad
suffice
it
to
say
zombie
dust
is
becoming
my
blue
sky
i
want
to
drink
this
on
tap
and
from
growlers
im
not
sure
i
could
ask
for
more
tastewise
from
an
apa
overall
another
winner
here
very
tastylight
and
drinkable
great
single
hop
apa
citra
hops
are
amazing
i
would
definately
recommend
d
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
little
assertive
hop
character
to
go
along
with
that
refreshing
spritzy
quality
o
very
good
beer
i
did
not
think
that
3f
possessed
the
restraint
to
so
delicately
craft
a
beer
like
this
truely
an
apa
but
this
is
not
suggested
by
the
nose
big
hops
but
when
you
drink
this
beer
is
balanced
and
mellow
yet
still
hoppy
well
done
cant
wait
for
this
beer
to
gravitate
to
the
central
part
of
our
state
three
floyds
has
a
magical
hop
garden
that
is
unmatched
this
beer
is
ridiculous
it
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
auburn
in
color
with
a
slight
white
lacing
around
the
snifter
the
aromas
are
other
worldly
the
citra
hops
are
both
insane
and
perfect
this
beer
is
so
ridiculously
aromatic
that
it
haunts
your
dreams
the
flavor
too
citra
overload
with
some
orange
zest
light
pine
slight
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
its
exceptional
the
detection
of
alcohol
is
the
only
knock
i
have
on
this
beer
this
beer
should
be
knighted
nominated
for
saint
hood
it
drinks
light
in
body
and
is
both
kickass
and
sessionable
at
the
same
time
i
drank
two
beers
multiple
times
at
dark
lord
day
pliny
and
zombie
dust
i
had
four
of
these
at
darkness
day
i
drank
six
of
these
throughout
the
day
at
the
fff
anniversary
party
this
beer
is
just
ridiculously
awesome
i
cant
get
enough
three
floyds
masters
pale
ales
like
no
other
edit
had
this
alone
tonight
bottle
was
maybe
90
days
old
i
loved
it
definitely
a
5
for
taste
changed
my
review
to
reflect
my
new
feelings
dry
finish
really
full
and
enjoyable
beer
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
i
cannot
say
enough
about
what
a
great
beer
this
is
i
look
forward
to
try
it
in
the
bottle
i
can
pretty
confidently
say
that
not
only
is
this
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
had
but
probably
my
new
favorite
beer
in
the
ipapale
ale
category
that
three
floyds
produces
i
used
to
think
daisy
cutter
was
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
but
this
one
beats
it
and
beats
it
solidly
it
helps
that
my
favorite
hop
being
citra
is
used
in
this
one
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
beer
when
i
was
at
the
party
and
look
forward
to
getting
as
much
as
people
will
trade
me
if
anyone
reads
this
and
wants
to
do
a
trade
hit
me
up
and
i
will
definitely
make
it
worth
your
while
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
am
over
it
i
have
heard
such
great
things
about
this
apa
that
maybe
it
coming
from
fff
i
was
expecting
an
ipa
profile
like
alpha
king
maybe
im
being
way
too
hard
on
fff
because
i
expected
that
rambling
i
may
be
the
point
is
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
hold
fff
to
an
ultra
high
standard
like
i
do
then
you
will
be
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
being
said
i
am
happy
thanks
to
timmyj21
for
this
extra
thanks
to
janderson91
for
this
one
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
orange
with
a
light
tan
head
and
some
large
bubbles
sitting
on
top
the
nose
has
a
light
grain
profile
a
touch
of
doughy
malt
citric
bite
and
notes
of
mango
the
flavor
follows
the
same
path
but
a
bit
fruitier
and
more
integrated
the
grain
and
dough
malt
balance
pretty
nicely
on
the
assertive
fruity
hop
flavors
of
citrus
and
other
tropical
fruits
the
bitterness
is
assertive
but
not
overpowering
on
medium
body
with
a
clean
semi
dry
finish
another
solid
hoppy
offering
from
fff
if
only
they
could
get
sugars
eaten
in
their
stouts
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
an
american
pale
ale
aggressively
hopped
with
a
wonderful
fruity
hop
character
superdrinkable
o
amazing
pale
ale
pushes
the
boundaries
of
the
style
for
sure
o
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
probably
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
just
wish
the
nose
didnt
lead
me
on
as
much
if
i
could
have
it
daily
i
would
this
is
a
terrific
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
around
overall
its
the
ruby
red
tangerine
of
beers
very
tastey
great
crisp
finish
cheers
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
apa
strong
and
well
flavored
after
all
the
commotion
this
beer
has
caused
in
the
forums
for
the
past
year
or
so
its
definitely
good
and
i
drink
it
all
the
time
probably
because
of
convenience
but
still
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
o
this
stuff
deserves
the
hype
great
beer
o
this
was
my
first
try
of
a
fff
offering
and
i
am
thouroughly
impressed
i
think
i
just
found
my
favorite
apa
a
must
try
beer
12
oz
bottle
from
woodchopper
pours
a
honey
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
fades
to
spotty
lace
the
nose
on
this
one
is
off
the
charts
full
of
orange
mango
and
apricot
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
nice
balance
of
lingering
yet
mild
bitterness
very
nice
and
id
love
to
sit
down
and
have
2
or
3
of
these
but
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
alpha
king
id
go
with
with
the
king
o
a
great
pale
ale
drinks
much
more
like
an
ipa
minus
the
honey
o
this
is
quite
good
overall
i
think
it
is
a
bit
heavy
overall
and
cant
believe
im
saying
this
maybe
a
bit
oversaturated
on
the
hop
flavors
probably
just
a
particular
aspect
which
i
associate
with
armpits
glad
to
try
this
one
dont
think
its
really
an
apa
its
a
good
ipa
for
me
worth
seeking
out
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
either
this
is
very
good
i
would
even
call
it
great
in
the
sense
that
it
seems
like
it
is
going
to
be
one
of
those
ipas
with
the
mislabeled
pa
on
it
based
on
the
smell
but
the
flavor
isnt
too
hop
forward
just
really
nice
and
balanced
overall
as
a
hophead
i
love
any
version
of
this
beer
it
is
even
better
on
cask
and
i
am
slowly
realizing
i
might
be
a
cask
ipa
fanatic
overall
sessionable
great
tasting
hoppy
brew
bright
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
with
good
lacing
and
good
duration
aroma
is
very
citrus
hop
forward
kind
of
juicy
grapefruit
clementine
tangerine
very
nice
flavor
is
clean
nice
citrus
hops
with
similar
citrus
notes
as
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
ok
could
be
a
touch
drier
and
there
is
not
enough
carbonation
for
me
overall
its
a
damn
good
beer
great
offering
by
fff
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
regardless
of
style
im
unsure
if
ive
been
so
taken
aback
by
any
beers
quite
this
much
lately
worth
the
accolades
it
gets
and
then
some
if
this
was
available
near
me
id
have
a
case
tomorrow
55
o
pretty
tasty
crazed
because
its
3fff
glad
i
got
to
try
one
thanks
a
lot
kyle
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
i
love
citra
hops
so
this
was
right
up
my
alley
it
was
so
juicy
and
bright
and
so
drinkable
at
the
same
time
i
loved
it
overall
and
only
wish
i
could
buy
it
more
easily
this
another
beer
that
actually
lives
up
to
the
hype
this
is
so
ridiculously
good
i
would
keep
this
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
if
i
could
get
more
of
it
cheers
to
rmalinowski4
for
sending
me
two
bottles
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
attain
this
brew
because
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
get
in
pa
great
offering
from
fff
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
as
good
or
better
than
the
other
apas
out
there
zombie
dust
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
year
certainly
my
favorite
pale
ale
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
just
explosive
without
being
overwhelming
dangerously
drinkable
there
would
not
be
an
issue
putting
down
a
fair
amount
in
a
night
flat
out
awesome
beer
od
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
still
cant
find
the
words
to
express
how
good
this
is
three
floyds
is
dead
on
with
this
one
yeah
i
just
dropped
that
lame
pun
o
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
the
citra
hops
aroma
and
taste
profile
are
outstanding
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
and
descent
lacing
intense
smells
of
pinecitrus
grapefruit
grass
taste
is
top
notch
with
hops
in
the
forefront
and
some
malts
great
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
this
is
really
easy
drinking
amazing
how
great
the
balance
is
this
is
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
o
this
was
a
very
hypedup
beer
from
the
beginning
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
approachable
nature
of
zombie
dust
warrants
the
fanfare
its
reception
drinkability
and
subsequent
market
availability
is
reminiscent
of
its
fff
comrade
gumballhead
in
fact
while
i
was
drinking
this
i
felt
as
if
i
was
drinking
the
zombie
offspring
of
hopslam
and
gumballhead
dangerously
enjoyablei
feel
like
i
could
definitely
enjoy
six
of
these
in
a
session
overall
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
im
not
a
hundred
percent
sure
its
a
pa
o
overall
this
beer
is
exceptional
the
aroma
is
a
thing
of
beauty
that
fills
the
room
and
gets
you
excited
for
your
first
sip
then
once
that
first
sip
is
taken
you
wondering
how
they
made
the
complex
smells
and
flavors
blend
into
a
perfect
balance
this
beer
is
great
example
of
an
american
pale
three
floyds
take
a
bow
thanks
any
for
the
great
extra
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
nice
orangish
color
with
a
silky
beige
head
lots
of
lace
incredible
nose
a
huge
bouquet
of
fresh
hops
backed
by
a
nice
bready
malt
profile
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
finish
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
another
great
beer
from
three
floyds
o
really
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
flavor
and
aroma
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
beer
very
refreshing
and
a
pure
delight
to
drink
this
is
a
balanced
beer
that
does
not
disappoint
the
look
of
the
beer
is
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
pine
and
grass
tastes
of
pine
and
citris
with
subtle
grapefruit
well
balanced
i
could
crush
this
beer
all
day
it
is
a
nice
bodied
beer
that
has
a
strong
hoppy
finish
and
a
nice
lingering
taste
once
again
this
is
my
favorite
beer
until
my
next
favorite
beer
lol
that
said
three
floyds
does
good
work
o
this
is
definitely
a
solid
offering
would
get
this
regularly
if
i
could
had
2
pints
it
was
so
refreshing
the
uber
extra
pale
ale
well
hop
and
cloudy
very
dry
hopped
and
a
bit
nougat
sweet
fruit
english
yeast
cloudy
yellow
with
a
nice
protein
sticky
head
a
bit
exotic
and
a
bit
power
house
resilient
hops
mid
west
favorite
due
to
the
fact
that
it
avoids
the
usual
core
hoping
of
amarillo
centennial
or
cascade
there
for
differentiating
it
a
nice
accent
and
unique
local
note
but
also
a
very
solid
national
beer
to
seek
out
have
it
on
tap
though
i
imagine
its
not
that
gold
in
the
bottle
after
about
1
month
i
dont
think
i
need
to
say
anything
else
just
an
amazing
drinkin
beer
from
fff
tons
of
complexity
yet
something
you
could
just
kick
back
with
highly
recommended
o
take
the
best
from
gumballhead
and
daisy
cutter
and
you
have
zombie
dust
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
its
rad
gold
to
amber
apa
with
a
full
head
that
falls
to
a
rounded
lace
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
menu
says
50
ibus
but
it
packs
a
much
bigger
punch
grassy
earthy
nose
that
sings
of
hops
light
fruit
and
bitterness
up
front
on
top
of
caramel
sweetness
not
a
big
beer
but
doesnt
taste
light
or
watery
at
alljust
not
heavy
smallish
beer
that
showcases
the
hop
bite
for
those
with
a
zombie
like
craving
for
hops
overall
hands
down
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
rarely
do
i
give
out
a
5
0
score
but
this
one
deserves
it
try
it
and
youll
agree
with
me
overall
holy
shit
i
didnt
think
an
apa
could
taste
so
awesome
so
much
fresh
tropical
fruit
and
awesome
hops
like
all
the
best
parts
of
the
hops
got
together
and
replicated
until
they
couldnt
anymore
and
this
is
the
byproduct
bravo
3f
bravo
medium
bodied
with
a
light
bit
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
quite
nice
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
type
this
i
now
only
have
a
couple
of
ounces
left
in
my
glass
damn
this
is
good
overall
no
surprise
another
great
beer
from
3floyds
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
i
would
definitely
seek
this
one
out
but
would
need
restraint
its
very
very
drinkable
drink
just
a
very
good
beer
three
floyds
makes
some
great
beer
dl
excluded
i
think
i
am
biased
being
in
so
cal
with
bt
anyway
kevin
thank
you
sir
amazing
beer
super
tasty
fresh
and
vibrant
o
very
aromatic
and
flavorful
brew
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
worth
repeating
do
a
refreshing
beer
with
high
drinkability
wide
appeal
on
this
one
its
a
fantastic
introduction
to
the
world
of
craft
brewing
for
your
nonbeergeek
friends
cant
wait
for
the
day
when
fff
starts
shipping
to
nyc
o
im
going
to
say
that
this
is
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
cheers
dark
lord
bless
three
floyds
sometimes
their
schtick
of
huge
malt
forward
beer
doesnt
really
work
for
me
but
this
thing
is
great
is
this
the
best
american
pale
ale
too
soon
to
say
surely
but
zombie
dust
makes
a
compelling
case
ugh
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
my
remaining
one
if
only
every
apa
could
be
this
good
this
is
phenomenal
well
done
fff
overall
really
good
beer
with
high
drinkability
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
fff
doing
what
they
do
best
making
great
ales
this
is
now
one
of
my
go
to
beers
im
so
freaking
glad
i
picked
this
up
during
a
visit
to
three
floyds
they
better
keep
this
one
on
their
roster
as
a
permanent
deal
seek
it
out
overall
the
best
pale
ale
around
o
this
is
an
awesome
pale
ale
the
proportion
of
the
flavors
is
amazing
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
that
i
could
see
drinking
a
six
pack
with
no
problem
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
orange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
lingers
smell
is
full
of
grapefruit
some
pine
aromas
as
well
as
hops
are
also
present
a
truly
great
smelling
beer
taste
is
spot
on
nice
sweetness
with
fruits
and
a
bitter
backbone
i
could
drink
so
many
of
these
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
i
loved
this
i
would
buy
this
every
day
if
available
around
me
i
suppose
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
for
the
abv
but
a
great
brew
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
say
silly
things
like
id
trade
for
this
beer
just
so
i
could
dump
it
on
my
head
the
perfect
beer
for
an
afternoon
spent
watching
football
i
could
session
these
things
all
day
im
really
glad
i
liked
this
one
so
much
too
since
a
lot
of
fff
brews
have
been
letting
me
down
lately
great
apa
perhaps
my
favorite
will
try
to
find
in
bottle
overall
it
is
exceptional
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
everything
in
great
harmony
and
balance
very
easy
to
drinkcrave
o
wow
an
overall
great
beer
that
was
well
worth
the
drive
kudos
to
my
friend
kevin
who
suggested
the
detour
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
this
wonderful
apa
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
pours
nicely
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
very
fluffy
head
it
smells
floral
and
strong
this
brew
has
an
interesting
taste
it
is
more
like
an
ipa
those
looking
for
a
more
mellow
apa
should
stay
away
but
it
is
quite
complex
the
flavors
accentuate
flowers
and
grapefruit
at
first
and
then
finish
with
a
strong
ipalike
bitterness
it
is
a
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
also
very
unique
it
is
almost
creamy
like
warm
milk
with
slight
carbonation
and
it
somehow
works
pretty
well
a
nice
job
on
this
one
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
probably
the
best
ipa
ive
ever
tried
yes
i
know
its
technically
an
apa
but
semantics
be
damned
this
tastes
like
one
hell
of
a
delicious
ipa
if
you
see
a
fresh
one
buy
it
immediately
if
you
can
try
this
beer
within
1
week
of
bottling
you
will
not
regret
the
effort
extremely
full
flavors
excellent
balance
and
very
easydrinking
wish
i
could
get
it
more
often
overall
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
and
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
wish
this
had
distro
in
washington
so
much
this
is
from
the
serving
type
bottle
hopefully
it
starts
hitting
the
market
in
force
although
i
bet
this
one
fades
very
quickly
amazing
pale
ale
o
ill
definitely
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
its
crazy
good
really
like
the
low
abv
as
i
can
see
myself
kicking
back
quite
a
few
of
these
a
very
nice
apa
the
taste
has
just
the
right
amount
of
everything
its
hoppy
enough
to
let
you
know
care
went
into
the
hop
profile
yet
sweet
and
slightly
earthy
at
the
same
time
the
citrus
from
the
nose
doesnt
betray
the
palate
i
wouldnt
call
it
rich
but
rather
drinkable
i
could
certainly
make
a
six
pack
enjoyably
last
through
a
full
sunday
of
football
i
havent
had
many
apas
and
maybe
this
is
setting
the
bar
high
but
the
balance
is
exactly
what
i
wish
i
found
in
more
ipas
llet
this
be
a
lesson
to
all
you
kids
out
there
if
youre
gonna
review
a
beer
do
it
right
the
first
few
times
i
had
this
i
thought
it
was
real
good
but
i
was
in
no
state
to
pass
final
judgment
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
on
a
different
occasion
with
a
clean
palate
i
would
pick
up
daisy
cutter
before
this
if
they
were
side
by
side
but
this
is
fff
so
its
worth
a
grab
as
well
o
great
pale
ale
chalk
up
another
great
ale
for
fff
cheers
overall
damn
near
perfect
apa
i
wish
the
abv
was
slightly
lower
but
otherwise
the
flavors
are
near
perfect
had
it
again
tonight
must
be
super
fresh
i
would
give
it
a
5
on
smell
taste
and
overall
damn
fine
beer
overall
a
very
nice
brew
by
three
floyds
if
it
was
more
available
to
me
i
would
probably
drink
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
of
it
mouthfeeloverall
between
light
and
medium
bodied
with
nice
fine
carbonation
a
bit
fuller
than
many
pale
ales
out
there
overall
the
best
example
of
this
style
ive
tried
really
reminds
me
somewhat
of
gumballhead
as
far
as
hop
character
but
unlike
that
beer
this
has
a
nice
malted
barley
presence
to
balance
that
wheat
doesnt
provide
very
impressed
overall
another
awesome
effort
from
three
floyds
what
did
you
expect
thanks
to
immobilisme
for
the
bottle
d
very
nice
apa
strong
flavors
but
not
over
powering
nicely
carbonated
medium
body
sweet
hop
lingering
aftertaste
love
the
relatively
low
abv
which
allows
for
a
few
more
tastings
really
cant
overstate
this
fact
as
to
me
having
a
session
ipaapa
of
this
caliber
shows
the
artistry
of
the
brewers
and
their
ability
to
create
such
a
fine
brew
and
not
need
to
jack
up
the
alcohol
giving
additional
weight
to
the
above
facts
tips
this
brew
into
the
rarified
air
of
exceptional
o
very
good
brew
the
citra
hops
really
shine
good
fff
brew
oh
and
the
label
is
pure
badass
really
good
not
a
daisy
cutter
classic
but
very
very
good
taste
is
citrus
and
sweet
tropical
fruit
very
fresh
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
smooth
sweet
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
really
good
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
nose
combined
with
the
citrus
and
hemp
flavors
are
remeniscent
of
a
good
ipa
the
nice
biscuity
malt
bill
smooths
things
out
and
the
creamy
feel
make
this
a
refreshing
insanely
drinkable
brew
id
have
this
regularly
if
it
was
available
in
cali
recommended
poured
into
a
pint
glass
great
golden
color
the
aroma
showed
citrusgrapefruit
and
the
taste
was
a
light
malty
background
and
fantastic
hoppy
taste
easily
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
as
im
a
sucker
for
hops
would
love
to
see
more
pales
go
towards
this
style
overall
impression
simply
fantastic
this
was
tough
to
compare
to
alpha
king
but
have
to
say
i
enjoy
this
one
more
from
memory
will
be
looking
back
my
alpha
king
review
and
seeing
how
it
compares
this
one
definitely
had
some
malt
aromaflavor
that
helped
balance
out
the
taste
and
make
more
characteristics
happen
will
be
getting
this
one
again
and
hopefully
in
a
6pack
or
more
o
4
o
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
outstanding
overall
this
was
a
great
apa
very
drinkble
and
very
fresh
i
opened
this
up
and
knew
i
would
enjoy
it
this
stuff
is
legit
get
some
of
this
now
thanks
to
rjhami
for
the
reminder
to
stop
in
munster
to
pick
up
this
excellent
example
of
a
pale
ale
overallgreat
citrus
nose
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
and
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
smell
great
beer
o
a
pretty
awesome
apa
if
not
one
of
the
best
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
5
a
pint
iirc
o
i
never
even
had
a
desire
to
try
this
even
though
i
saw
thread
after
thread
iso
it
but
now
that
i
have
im
completely
blown
away
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
that
went
down
real
easy
for
me
the
massive
hop
flavors
and
aroma
may
indicate
that
this
beer
could
be
classified
as
an
ipa
but
who
really
cares
what
the
style
is
because
it
was
delicious
thanks
to
my
friend
justin
for
hooking
me
up
with
some
kick
ass
three
floyds
straight
from
the
brewery
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
as
it
was
ridiculously
smooth
and
outstanding
overall
an
absolute
session
beer
for
me
that
i
could
drink
anytime
and
all
the
time
o
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
its
more
like
an
ipa
really
fruity
and
hoppy
balanced
and
extremely
easy
drinking
this
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
really
impressed
light
body
with
a
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
thats
perfect
for
the
style
while
not
quite
a
light
abv
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
very
nice
beer
o
if
you
could
breed
gumballhead
and
apocalypse
cow
this
would
be
the
offspring
bravo
three
floyds
bravo
o
ive
been
a
little
hard
on
fff
in
the
past
their
dipas
just
havent
really
done
it
for
me
but
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
theyve
managed
to
pack
a
lot
of
the
aspects
that
i
enjoy
in
an
ipadipa
into
an
apa
i
love
it
and
ill
be
trading
for
as
much
as
i
can
manage
in
the
future
o
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
like
a
tropical
hop
paradise
kudos
to
three
floyds
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
had
from
them
and
now
i
am
so
glad
they
are
back
in
ohio
to
be
fair
i
do
not
care
for
really
hoppy
beers
if
you
want
a
real
craft
beer
from
fff
try
ragnarok
not
bad
but
just
too
much
hops
to
malt
ratio
for
my
taste
buds
seems
after
12
years
it
will
age
like
fine
wine
if
you
like
hops
offer
me
a
trade
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
hop
head
will
love
it
the
hops
are
on
parade
in
ways
the
are
both
bold
and
subtile
three
floyds
is
not
available
in
my
area
i
will
be
looking
for
more
excuses
for
road
trips
o
an
exceptional
beer
it
would
be
very
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
several
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
i
definitely
want
to
try
to
get
some
more
of
these
at
some
point
in
the
future
o
a
great
pale
ale
standard
to
high
on
the
bitter
factor
its
a
little
one
dimensional
in
flavor
but
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
verrry
good
think
straight
citrus
ill
have
again
if
i
can
find
it
o
goes
down
easy
very
tasty
not
too
filling
decent
kick
a
bit
more
ipa
than
apa
but
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
would
absolutely
hit
up
all
the
time
overall
while
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
whether
this
one
could
live
up
to
all
the
hype
it
turned
out
to
be
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
another
extremely
welldone
showing
by
three
floyds
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
bottle
of
this
one
and
this
is
a
much
shorter
review
than
normal
because
im
headed
up
to
vermont
to
compare
this
to
hill
farmsteads
edward
theyre
in
the
same
league
this
is
by
far
the
best
ipa
i
have
ever
had
i
was
excited
to
learn
that
three
floyd
started
to
bottle
it
although
it
is
a
rare
find
i
got
my
hands
on
some
at
whole
foods
in
chicago
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
stemless
wine
glass
to
appreciate
the
foggy
golden
color
and
offers
a
heavy
mango
aroma
with
hints
of
pineapple
floral
and
miscellaneous
citrus
scents
the
first
sip
bites
your
tongue
with
the
sting
of
hops
like
other
ipas
however
the
aftertaste
doesnt
linger
it
finishes
clean
leaving
a
delightful
taste
behind
the
carbonation
floats
down
the
side
and
reflects
the
light
to
shimmer
it
such
a
way
that
it
looks
like
it
could
be
zombie
dust
it
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
offers
interesting
comic
artwork
by
tim
seeley
i
highly
recommend
if
you
can
find
it
overall
this
is
the
craziest
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
its
hard
not
to
call
it
an
ipa
easily
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
drunk
thanks
to
a
buddy
for
a
bottle
of
this
pours
mostly
a
clear
orange
with
a
very
slight
haze
to
it
with
fluffy
white
head
tastes
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
nice
crisp
bitterness
and
it
provides
hop
burps
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
thanks
again
carleton
o
amazing
apa
and
probably
my
current
favorite
beer
not
a
huge
fff
fan
i
know
weird
right
but
this
one
is
certainly
a
winner
go
find
this
right
now
and
drink
til
your
heart
is
content
12
oz
bottle
generous
extra
from
dougofthefuture
thanks
doug
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
wonderful
huge
mango
light
pineapple
light
grapefruit
and
some
light
honey
this
is
definitely
a
citra
hopped
beer
the
initial
taste
is
some
sweet
mango
that
goes
into
a
light
breadiness
with
a
bit
of
pineapple
the
finish
has
some
biscuit
more
mango
as
well
as
a
light
bitterness
light
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
relatively
low
carbonation
great
beer
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
drink
this
regularly
othis
was
an
amazing
offering
from
fff
it
reminds
me
honestly
of
gumball
head
this
would
be
my
everyday
goto
pale
ale
if
it
were
accessible
to
me
fantastic
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
haze
with
a
big
sticky
off
white
head
the
lacing
on
this
one
is
sticky
and
hangs
around
smell
is
an
absolute
knockout
huge
pineapple
grapefruit
tangerine
notes
citrus
goodness
just
dominates
the
aroma
i
feel
like
im
at
an
outdoor
farmers
market
selling
only
tropical
fruit
taste
is
only
a
slight
notch
below
the
smell
with
the
bulk
of
that
citrus
hitting
you
square
in
the
palate
the
tail
end
of
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
grass
included
with
the
citrus
mouthfeel
is
solid
though
a
bit
dryer
at
the
end
than
i
expected
this
beer
really
goes
down
easy
though
this
is
another
winner
from
three
floyds
and
one
that
i
will
always
have
on
my
wants
list
o
overall
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
the
hype
around
this
beer
is
justified
and
this
comment
will
lead
to
that
hype
but
this
one
really
will
not
disappoint
although
this
is
an
apa
it
hangs
with
pliny
sculpin
abner
etc
without
question
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
definitely
dont
miss
out
4
5
o
well
this
is
interesting
not
like
anything
ive
ever
really
tasted
before
and
a
really
fresh
take
on
the
style
for
me
i
really
like
the
change
of
pace
the
disparity
between
the
nose
and
taste
is
a
little
bit
confusing
but
thats
about
the
only
complaint
i
have
o
good
stuff
the
smell
was
unbelievable
and
tasts
although
wasnt
anything
like
the
nose
was
still
good
edit
had
on
tap
at
fff
and
bumped
scored
a
bit
was
45444
give
me
this
oracle
and
2009
founders
harvest
ale
every
day
please
o
this
will
be
my
regular
drinker
im
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
and
this
one
tastes
wonderful
drinks
easily
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
denser
than
it
seems
from
the
sweet
taste
leaves
a
great
sticky
film
in
my
mouth
overall
wow
i
literally
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
every
day
three
floyds
never
disappoints
this
one
is
just
so
drinkable
perfect
beer
for
warm
weather
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
o
i
always
try
to
make
sure
i
dont
gush
on
a
beer
when
i
try
to
give
it
a
review
but
this
one
really
just
makes
me
happy
i
always
want
to
leave
room
for
another
beer
to
come
along
and
blow
me
out
of
the
water
but
you
also
have
to
pay
your
respects
when
you
have
a
beer
that
does
just
that
this
one
has
rocked
me
to
the
core
and
i
cant
believe
what
a
sensory
experience
this
is
its
a
pale
ale
with
an
infectious
personality
and
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
called
zombie
dust
if
i
had
enough
of
it
with
me
id
drink
this
till
i
was
a
zombie
myself
put
this
on
your
wants
and
get
a
full
pack
i
have
to
admit
i
think
this
is
better
than
hoppy
birthday
sorry
alpine
its
the
juiciness
i
still
love
the
pine
nutty
malt
on
hoppy
birthday
but
damn
this
juiciness
o
this
can
satisfy
as
a
warm
weather
having
a
few
beer
or
as
a
sipperthe
flavors
are
much
bigger
than
the
abv
would
suggest
this
is
the
only
beer
gumball
is
close
that
i
can
just
drink
over
and
over
and
over
and
not
tire
of
it
its
all
i
want
to
drink
and
i
have
been
struggling
to
consume
some
of
the
other
standbys
in
my
beer
fridge
o
all
i
can
say
is
wow
blown
away
easily
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
its
like
an
ipa
with
out
the
bitterness
or
sweetness
hops
shine
through
without
wrecking
your
palate
truly
an
amazing
well
crafted
beer
one
day
i
hope
to
brew
the
equal
of
this
beer
until
then
we
have
zombie
dust
from
fff
to
drink
get
this
if
you
can
it
is
staggeringly
delicious
o
really
the
most
complex
and
delicious
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
not
too
hopped
heavy
or
malty
just
balance
in
its
purest
sense
i
need
to
get
my
hands
on
a
case
of
this
stuff
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
good
like
i
previously
stated
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
overall
great
stuff
about
as
good
as
hoppy
pale
ales
get
i
love
the
zombie
dust
the
cpj
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
like
i
said
the
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
nose
but
thats
mostly
because
this
is
such
a
nice
smelling
beer
well
done
3
floyds
i
actually
prefer
this
to
dreadnaught
huge
fan
of
this
very
hoppy
very
drinkable
pale
ale
o
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
of
the
year
or
one
of
the
highest
i
have
ranked
this
year
i
wish
this
was
distributed
into
my
market
or
i
could
obtain
a
keg
of
this
stuff
because
i
would
only
drink
this
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recommend
picking
some
up
o
a
wonderful
apa
like
alpha
king
its
hard
to
call
this
just
an
apa
but
whatever
it
is
its
damn
tasty
speaking
of
alpha
king
id
love
to
try
this
head
to
head
with
fresh
alpha
king
o
im
trying
to
not
go
overboard
but
this
might
become
one
of
my
favorites
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
this
time
may
weather
my
opinion
but
right
now
i
highly
recommend
this
overall
worth
that
hype
and
man
do
i
love
this
aftertaste
of
grapefruit
its
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
very
tasty
the
hops
are
the
main
attraction
but
are
mellowed
by
the
wheat
and
malt
profile
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
just
a
wonderful
apa
this
is
all
hops
just
stunning
i
want
more
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
much
like
most
of
what
ive
had
from
three
floyds
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
i
originally
wanted
this
beer
for
the
kickass
artwork
but
after
getting
my
hands
on
it
i
think
this
might
just
be
one
of
the
best
allaround
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
refreshing
complex
and
very
drinkable
it
has
everything
youd
ever
want
from
the
style
skål
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
not
quite
as
much
as
my
another
chicagoarea
pale
ale
the
supreme
reign
of
daisy
cutter
continues
its
a
shame
too
since
ill
be
able
to
pick
this
up
locally
o
overall
this
is
my
favorite
apa
ive
had
big
and
flavorful
yet
easy
to
drink
a
thanks
carelton
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
light
gold
color
with
a
small
but
noticeable
head
that
went
away
quickly
the
smell
is
out
of
this
world
reminds
me
of
gumball
head
on
steroids
the
same
fruity
notes
come
out
in
both
with
this
i
get
more
floral
tones
than
with
the
gumball
head
but
very
similar
once
i
got
past
the
formalities
and
actually
got
to
taste
it
what
i
got
in
the
smell
carried
over
to
the
taste
as
far
as
it
being
similar
to
gumball
head
this
beer
to
me
is
a
heavier
more
tasty
version
it
i
enjoy
drinking
this
and
could
see
myself
drinking
multiple
of
these
this
has
a
very
good
mouthfeel
and
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
overall
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
fff
beer
but
that
puts
it
into
the
top
10
of
all
beers
4

o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
bitter
hops
but
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
the
bitterness
that
lingers
is
easily
combated
with
another
drink
overall
i
am
in
love
this
may
be
a
new
goto
on
hot
days
and
certainly
is
a
step
above
alpha
king
blasphemous
go
try
it
out
i
cant
wait
for
the
bottles
to
appear
o
a
really
wellcrafted
beer
very
interesting
bringing
things
to
the
table
ive
never
encountered
before
in
this
style
in
a
tasteful
and
tasty
manner
great
beer
tastes
as
sweet
as
it
smells
big
juicy
tropical
hops
explode
on
the
palette
a
slight
bitterness
hits
at
the
end
and
slowly
builds
into
a
full
presence
smooth
and
creamy
feel
but
could
probably
be
a
bit
more
lively
in
the
mouth
overall
a
fantastic
apa
but
i
still
think
i
would
take
daisy
cutter
over
it
most
days
of
the
week
o
three
floyds
packs
a

carbonation
is
a

lower
than
i
wouldve
liked
but
this
beer
is
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
probably
because
its
a
great
ipa
marketed
as
an
apa
considerably
better
than
hf
citra
and
kr
citra
imo
ive
sampled
both
fresh
from
a
just
tapped
keg
and
opened
growler
could
not
recommend
this
beer
more
get
it
as
soon
as
you
can
this
is
one
outstanding
apa
overall
i
must
start
by
saying
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
hypetrain
time
and
time
again
i
am
let
down
because
i
let
hype
tell
me
that
x
beer
will
be
insanely
amazing
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
easily
i
think
three
floyds
raised
the
bar
on
this
style
for
sure
definitely
gotta
grab
some
of
this
if
you
are
given
the
chance
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic

between

then
also
skunky

the
good
ones
had

its
a
world
class
beer
billed
as
an
extra
pale

i
like
that
style
a
little
dryer

seems
more
like
an

or
stronger
spectrum
pale
goldenyellow
translucent

subtle

i
get
a

mostly

forward
ill
drink
it
again
very
pleasant
and
outstanding
apa
it
has
its
own
character
superbly
balanced
for
hop
heads
not
cloying
and
hoppy
and
crisp
that
is
definitely
a
6pack
beer
to
have
it
in
every
season
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
seasonal
though
i
prefer
some
other
odell
brews
a
little
more
not
sure
its
really
that
much
different
than
5
barrel
or
even
their
ipa
but
once
again
ill
drink
it
if
its
out
there
harder
to
find
than
most
of
their
other
beers
as
well
but
worth
a
look
overall
a
delicious
and
very
refreshing
pale
ale
among
my
favorites
in
this
style
lots
of
citrus
hops
and
high
abv
could
easily
pass
for
an
ipa
flavor
dominated
by
hops
would
expect
more
balance
from
an
apa
overall
tastywill
definitely
buy
again
turbid
golden
body
with
resinous
floating
particles
creamy
tan
head
floral
and
caramel
malt
nose
and
flavors
pretty
solid
not
a
ton
of
depth
but
very
crisp
and
pretty
tasty
great
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
beer
definitely
one
that
im
going
to
include
in
my
take
home
sixer
overall
get
it
whilst
you
can
because
its
not
gonna
hang
around
anyone
with
even
a
passing
interest
in
any
kind
of
pale
ale
really
should
give
it
a
blast
probably
the
best
thing
ive
tasted
in
months
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
i
really
liked
their
5
barrel
pale
ale
but
this
is
even
better
bravo
odells
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
no
obvious
notice
of
alcohol
i
really
like
this
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
o
best
pale
ale
i
have
had
in
awhile
almost
ipaish
get
some
overall
a
really
good
take
on
a
apa
very
good
taste
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
a
nice
malt
backing
one
of
the
better
hop
forward
versions
of
the
style
im
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
have
been
with
most
beers
from
this
world
class
brewery
the
fruity
floral
character
and
light
but
not
too
light
body
seem
just
right
for
a
hot
texas
day
this
is
certainly
a
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
each
and
every
summer
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
golden
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
offers
herbal
and
floral
notes
with
grass
and
light
pine
medium
bitterness
throughout
grassy
and
even
tart
some
biscuit
malt
in
support
zesty
and
tangy
pretty
tasty

tasted
june

a
very
tasty
and
quaff
able
beverage
that
makes
it
easy
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
very
nice
pale
o
probably
my
favorite
pale
ale
not
super
bold
flavors
but
enough
to
keep
this
interesting
yet
highly
drinkable
ive
been
very
impressed
with
odell
since
theyve
made
it
to
texas
overall
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
youre
going
to
find
pours
out
a
pale
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
hops
smell
strongly
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
a
bit
of
guava
tastes
of
bready
malt
sweetness
and
loads
of
fruity
hops
the
fruitiness
goes
well
with
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
rather
full
with
a
lightly
prickly
carbonation
this
is
delicious
a
really
good
pale
ale
this
is
loose
leafs
bigger
brother
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
with
a
more
pronounced
pinysoapy
flavor
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
i
do
think
i
like
loose
leaf
just
a
bit
more
though
this
is
no
less
of
an
enjoyable
beer
o
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
a
kind
its
got
good
citrus
notes
and
the
bitter
bite
is
there
but
very
manageable
tastes
good
and
id
have
no
problem
drinking
this
all
the
time
but
i
can
name
20
other
american
ipas
just
as
good
or
better
one
of
the
best
beers
from
odell
im
counting
the
days
till
the
new
batch
comes
out
its
one
of
the
great
summer
time
drinkers
with
the
heavy
hop
taste
but
a
light
easy
drinking
finish
it
should
be
back
in
stores
over
the
next
couple
of
months
texas
is
in
for
a
great
surprise
this
summer
welcome
to
the
big
show
smell
is
still
as
robust
as
ever
for
an
ipa
reminds
me
of
jai
alai
but
a
touch
more
palatable
worth
trying
o
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
extra
pale
ale
it
is
not
as
big
in
hop
bitterness
as
i
thought
that
it
would
be
but
it
is
tasty
and
delicious
i
would
buy
it
again
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
decent
head
and
some
really
nice
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
piney
with
citrus
and
honey
yeasty
tone
bittered
with
a
crisp
hop
and
diverse
citrus
sweetened
with
honey
and
balanced
with
a
little
fresh
tea
leaf
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
this
was
a
great
beer
and
in
my
opinion
is
spot
on
for
the
style
while
remaining
unique
and
interesting
not
overly
complex
just
very
well
done
i
also
prefer
these
brews
in
a
very
frosted
mug
pint
size
which
at
happy
hours
is
3
50
per
pint
i
was
looking
for
a
go
to
pale
ale
after
moving
away
from
the
coast
and
had
exceptionally
high
expectations
that
this
would
be
it
after
my
first
foray
with
it
this
summer
i
thought
it
might
fill
the
role
but
it
would
be
a
couple
of
months
before
i
saw
it
at
the
shop
again
with
that
six
pack
i
was
initially
underwhelmed
disappointed
is
actually
a
more
appropriate
term
for
how
i
felt
and
thought
it
was
back
to
the
drawing
board
but
about
halfway
through
the
magic
was
recovered
i
dont
know
why
it
seemed
so
drastically
different
to
me
from
the
first
to
the
second
half
of
that
six
pack
but
im
now
firmly
back
in
the
camp
of
loving
it
thought
honestly
not
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
from
a
brewery
i
am
only
now
learning
to
appreciate
sad
it
took
me
this
long
to
discover
them
but
glad
im
getting
to
now
its
hard
to
pick
up
on
certain
flavors
but
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
the
hops
used
are
more
leaning
towards
floralfruity
which
work
very
well
with
the
grains
used
for
the
malt
if
youre
into
sweeter
pale
ales
this
is
for
you
i
usually
prefer
mine
with
a
more
hop
forward
profile
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
nothing
worthwhile
as
well
a
good
sipper
for
a
couple
overall
very
drinkable
but
still
holds
my
interest
poured
into
a
goblet
yellowamber
color
with
a
nice
looking
head
that
had
some
staying
power
aroma
was
extremely
pilsnerlike
i
thought
and
while
i
like
a
good
pilsner
here
and
there
i
didnt
buy
a
pilsner
and
was
therefore
a
little
thrown
by
the
zingy
grass
and
breadiness
i
should
mention
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
pale
ales
though
i
do
like
sns
of
course
who
doesnt
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
hoppiness
given
the
story
about
st
lupulin
tending
to
his
hops
and
the
hop
field
design
on
the
label
and
there
is
some
but
its
not
really
up
front
in
fact
this
beer
is
just
so
balanced
just
so
medium
across
the
board
medium
body
medium
hops
medium
malt
that
it
was
hard
for
me
to
identify
this
beers
particular
character
i
mean
wheres
the
hook
whats
the
angle
here
very
drinkable
and
you
could
probably
drink
these
all
day
long
and
not
get
tired
of
them
though
the
6
abv
kind
of
excludes
it
from
a
sessionable
as
well
good
but
just
confused
as
to
where
they
were
going
with
this
otonight
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
st
lupulin
from
the
bottle
i
have
had
on
tap
multiple
times
prior
to
this
and
enjoyed
it
more
and
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
not
terribly
impressed
the
smell
was
balanced
but
just
ok

thing
in
my
opinion
they
call
it
an
extra
pale
ale
d
i
would
struggle
to
give
this
anything
other
than
an
average
score
there
is
nothing
particularly
dislikeable
about
the
beer
but
by
the
same
token
nothing
to
get
excited
about
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
one
to
turn
down
thanks
to
the
nonbrewing
friend
who
brought
it
over
to
a
home
brew
tasting
o
a
tasty
apa
with
some
unique
characteristics
making
for
a
pleasureable
experience
easily
drinkable
and
certainly
sessionable
i
could
drink
a
6er
of
this
stuff
any
day
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
beers
o
considering
that
its
an
old
bottle
it
is
quite
balanced
and
flavorful
good
complexity
will
look
forward
to
tasting
it
again
next
summer
damn
very
nice
highly
drinkable
if
i
had
another
id
crack
it
right
now
light
body
and
sweet
malt
perfectly
balanced
with
a
hefty
dose
of
aromaticbitter
hops
too
bad
its
a
bit
pricey
over
here
otherwise
id
make
this
a
regular
purchase
a
must
try
for
the
uninitiated
like
their
ipa
not
huge
not
chest
beating
but
firm
and
strong
with
so
much
character
and
development
another
total
winner
from
odell
an
almost
genre
defining
american
pale
ale
has
all
the
complex
hop
characteristics
you
look
for
but
also
has
something
all
of
its
own
a
jazzy
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
despite
the
higer
abv
make
this
a
magical
back
porch
session
there
are
hop
flavors
in
this
beer
that
i
have
never
tasted
in
another
brew
it
somehow
gets
to
the
essence
of
hops
without
being
major
bitter
its
just
a
real
treat
bravo
odell
overall
this
beer
is
delightful
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
next
year
odell
lupulin
pale
ale
this
seasonal
from
odell
has
a
rich
golden
body
topped
with
a
pillowy
head
and
a
great
aroma
to
drawn
in
slowly
it
is
very
smooth
almost
a
luxurious
feel
to
it
with
flavor
that
is
full
but
well
balanced
nice
malt
tone
throughout
with
great
hop
flavors
coming
and
going
but
no
bitter
or
bite
the
lupulin
is
an
extraordinary
pale
ale
congrats
to
the
folks
at
odell
o
good
starter
beer
for
those
who
arent
quite
acclimated
to
hop
bombs
more
hoppy
than
an
epa
but
not
quite
up
to
ipa
standards
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
compromise
the
bartender
mentioned
that
this
was
a
very
popular
beer
and
i
guess
i
can
see
that
its
got
enough
flavor
to
appeal
to
most
beer
geeks
but
is
not
so
intensely
flavored
that
it
will
shock
any
macro
drinker
in
the
mood
for
something
with
a
bit
more
flavor
however
for
me
id
take
a
snpa
over
this
beer
every
time
super
hoppy
and
tasty
pale
ale
nearly
ipa
territory
a
real
treat
to
get
a
chance
to
try
this
oa
great
hop
forward
pale
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
my
favorite
beer
from
odell
o
excellent
pale
ale
not
for
the
feint
of
heart
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
and
certainly
more
earthy
than
any
other
ive
had
but
well
crafted
complex
and
has
a
sensational
mouthfeel
0
this
brew
is
way
to
good
its
the
perfect
beer
for
summer
its
perfect
for
after
going
for
a
bike
ride
or
for
sitting
by
the
beach
i
wish
this
wasnt
a
seasonal
and
was
year
round
a
very
nice
beer
i
bought
this
in
kansas
city
and
wish
i
could
get
more
the
first
to
last
swallow
is
crisp
and
refreshing
as
expected
from
an
extra
pale
ale
the
hops
are
mild
hops
but
there
are
lots
of
them
a
hint
of
sweetness
almost
red
aleish
clean
aftertaste
fetching
label
provides
an
eyetaste
of
whats
inside
perfect
for
après
mountain
bike
exhaustion
overall
impression
very
refreshing
but
not
enough
hop
or
flavor
for
me
this
style
is
usually
very
hoppy
and
this
brew
would
be
perfect
if
it
had
more
of
this
love
odell
brewing
but
fell
short
on
this
one
for
me
thanks
chugalug06
for
the
extra
in
the
trade
overall
a
real
solid
pale
ale
simply
put
this
is
a
nice
beer
although
probably
not
sessionable
6
5
it
drinks
kind
of
like
a
session
beer
this
could
be
dangerous
on
a
hot
day
while
certainly
solid
i
think
that
this
might
have
a
bit
of
age
on
it
as
this
just
lacked
that
fresh
brightness
that
so
many
other
reviews
seem
to
mention
this
was
still
well
flavored
and
balanced
and
an
overall
refreshing
quaff
though
im
going
to
be
seeking
this
one
out
on
draft
when
im
in
idaho
next
month
as
this
really
showed
some
potential
overall
i
think
this
one
stands
up
to
most
american
ipas
brewed
in
the
us
this
has
such
a
bright
and
refreshing
taste
and
mouth
it
should
be
enjoyed
by
the
sixer
all
summer
long
highly
recommended
summer
or
not
o
another
great
beer
from
odell
great
representation
of
the
style
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
many
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
extememly
satisfying
when
youre
looking
for
a
pale
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
that
doesnt
burn
you
out
wish
this
was
available
year
round
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
but
what
is
there
is
delicioius
a
really
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
bit
on
the
carbonated
side
but
not
too
bad
the
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
in
the
flavor
odells
offering
is
spot
on
a
great
apa
like
a
good
little
apa
this
approaches
but
does
not
dare
to
meet
the
ipa
boundaries
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
a
welcome
respite
for
various
parts
of
my
palate
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
i
really
like
it
a
lot
it
pours
an
averagesized
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
and
laces
the
glass
a
little
bit
sweetened
citrus
is
what
i
smell
most
in
the
aroma
every
beer
i
really
like
balances
its
hops
and
malt
and
has
a
flavor
that
makes
it
stand
out
in
a
pleasant
and
hardtodescribe
way
this
is
one
of
those
beers
its
sweeter
than
most
of
my
favorite
beers
the
hops
are
both
sharp
and
soft
at
the
same
time
the
aftertaste
is
strong
but
clean
o
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
refreshing
and
can
go
well
with
a
lot
of
things
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
tasted
a
week
after
id
undergone
sinus
surgery
so
my
sense
of
smell
was
a
little
wonky
id
been
through
a
string
of
aggressively
hoppy
beers
lagunitas
lucky
13
two
bro
hop
juice
hop
ottin
and
this
was
a
nice
break
hoppy
but
not
too
hoppy
cheers
overall
good
but
not
a
trendsetter
for
the
style
we
sampled
this
one
at
the
odell
taproom
with
some
friends
a
few
saturdays
ago
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
bubbly
white
foam
great
floralfruity
hop
aromas
somewhat
grassy
bubblegum
on
the
palaet
this
one
was
light
bodied
with
flavors
of
fruity
hops
pears
and
malt
final
notes
this
is
a
great
beer
and
easily
one
of
the
best
summer
seasonals
ive
had
bordering
on
ipa
territory
but
retains
the
refreshment
and
lighter
character
of
the
apa
style
good
utility
beer
overall
a
fantastic
summer
beer
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
odell
they
are
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
awesome
seasonal
ale
from
odell
great
job
once
again
odell
i
could
drink
this
one
all
summer
long
lots
of
feel
and
body
to
this
one
its
slick
off
the
bat
and
turns
slightly
chalky
through
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
mild
but
certainly
ample
odell
does
it
again
o
if
there
was
an
extra
pale
ale
category
this
is
the
winer
in
my
opinion
a
great
summer
brew
because
it
is
light
but
still
carries
some
hop
presence
o
one
of
if
not
the
best
summer
seasonal
brew
ive
had
so
tasty
crisp
and
different
from
most
of
the
ipas
out
there
it
isnt
overdone
with
grapefruit
very
good
beer
especially
for
the
style
i
will
buy
this
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
expected
with
a
crisp
floral
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
earthy
notes
into
a
dry
finish
earthy
pine
grass
and
straw
countered
by
some
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
d
a
pretty
inoffensive
pale
ale
from
odell
id
have
it
again
in
a
pinch
but
its
nothing
terribly
exciting
pours
a
semiclear
orangeyellow
color
with
a
12
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
distinct
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
citrus
zest
with
a
noticeable
soapy
aroma
taste
is
of
malt
and
citrus
zest
and
floral
hops
again
with
a
slightly
soapy
flavor
like
the
smell
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
though
as
odell
isnt
distributed
to
ca
o
an
above
average
beer
just
expected
a
bit
more
from
this
one
o
very
impressed
i
could
easily
see
this
becoming
one
of
my
regulars
in
the
fridge
12oz
bottle
from
total
wine
desert
ridge
pours
clear
golden
color
with
offwhite
head
light
carbonation
aroma
has
grapefruit
lemon
resin
and
some
dank
aromas
taste
has
some
bitterness
but
is
mostly
malty
like
fat
tire
medium
bodied
with
chunky
texture
bitter
finish
not
a
fan
of
this
att
all
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
on
this
site
its
like
a
hoppy
version
of
fat
tire
d
very
good
worth
a
second
or
third
try
overall
this
is
an
insanely
refreshing
brew
with
some
superb
hop
aromatics
a
very
solid
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
it
had
some
very
nice
hoppy
notes
to
it
but
the
malt
came
through
with
some
nice
balancing
flavors
very
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
of
the
style
d
well
balanced
and
very
easy
drinking
nice
summer
beer
o
a
pleasant
drinker
that
i
would
recommend
dr
a
wonderful
summer
ale
it
obscures
its
abv
very
well
quite
delightful
but
dont
make
the
mistake
of
buying
it
in
ireland
when
youre
from
the
state
its
brewed
in
oops
oi
think
this
is
a
great
seasonal
beer
just
got
done
doing
yard
work
in
85
degree
weather
and
this
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
i
would
say
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
an
american
pale
good
for
a
session
beer
i
was
really
expecting
a
bright
sunny
hop
profile
just
short
of
odell
ipa
a
bit
taken
a
back
this
comes
off
a
more
balanced
and
earthy
dry
hopped
english
pale
ale
with
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
slightly
shifted
towards
the
hops
resinous
hop
oil
feel
was
as
good
as
advertised
drinkability
another
quality
hoppy
beer
from
odell
much
better
than
the
typical
apa
d
very
high
pass
me
another
would
definitely
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
could
overall
a
excellent
straightforward
hoppy
and
very
drinkable
apa
recommended
very
crisp
and
extremely
light
in
the
mouth
easy
to
go
through
a
bottle
without
really
realizing
it
light
to
medium
body
with
bright
flavors
the
carbonation
level
adds
to
make
it
a
really
refreshing
drink
as
it
is
a
summer
seasonal
in
the
end
due
to
this
being
a
seasonal
beer
from
may
to
septemberoctober
it
really
fits
in
with
the
early
summer
feeling
its
one
to
mow
the
lawn
with
so
you
can
further
pull
out
the
plant
smells
and
tastes
that
are
hiding
under
all
the
hops
i
would
love
to
sip
this
while
walking
through
fresh
cut
grass
that
crisp
tangy
smell
permeating
the
last
of
the
early
afternoon
humidity
cannot
stress
this
enough
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
top
notch
drinkability
unique
feeling
to
the
bitterness
that
i
like
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
complex
enough
to
make
it
worth
thinking
about
while
you
drink
it
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
you
will
need
to
like
a
dominant
hop
focus
though
light
and
quaffable
with
a
robust
hop
character
that
keeps
this
hop
head
coming
back
for
more
toasted
malt
up
front
dry
hoppy
bitterness
follows
with
flavors
of
lemon
orange
rind
and
light
pine
very
mildly
sweet
biscuit
and
fruit
malt
notes
settle
in
citrus
and
pine
hoppiness
steals
the
show
though
the
dry
zesty
hop
btterness
almost
takes
on
a
floral
herbalness
light
tropical
fruit
shows
up
in
the
lingering
mostly
bitter
finish
moderate
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
feel
due
partly
to
mild
carbonation
a
nice
very
dry
and
refreshing
apa
that
really
shows
off
the
citrus
hops
but
in
a
not
overly
bitter
and
heavyhanded
way
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
nice
two
fingered
head
that
is
leaving
a
beautiful
rings
behind
nose
is
light
floral
hops
taste
is
a
nicely
balanced
between
a
solid
malt
backbone
finishing
with
a
decent
citrus
hop
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
satisfying
drinkability
is
good
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
several
can
be
enjoyed
at
one
sitting
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
with
some
nice
heft
that
is
very
enjoyable
another
fine
effort
from
my
favorite
colorado
brewer
overall
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
solid
playfully
light
and
sweetened
showcase
of
a
style
i
usually
avoid
a
solid
drinker
of
a
pale
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
cheers
nice
carbonation
crisp
clean
light
to
medium
bodied
a
nice
drinkable
beer
which
i
would
gladly
buy
and
drink
again
great
to
see
odell
now
being
sold
in
mn
a
new
brewer
for
me
to
try
thanks
to
the
muddy
pig
in
st
paul
mn
at
6
5
and
46
ibus
this
dry
hopped
extra
pale
ale
looks
a
bit
hazy
and
golden
amber
colored
with
a
fair
head
with
a
fantastic
sheet
of
lace
the
aroma
says
pine
and
sweet
floral
hops
with
that
likable
skunk
to
it
very
alluring
and
somewhat
unique
the
taste
buds
grab
onto
this
enjoyable
pissy
hop
that
so
nicely
combines
citrus
floral
edges
and
a
hint
of
pine
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
the
feel
is
lightly
peppery
and
crisp
very
refreshing
while
delivery
plenty
of
bright
hop
satisfaction
it
has
a
bit
of
biscuit
clove
that
becomes
obvious
as
you
go
i
liked
this
and
would
consider
this
a
definite
candidate
for
hop
session
beer
of
the
month
a
happy
introduction
to
odell
from
fort
collins
co
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangered
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
screams
centennial
hops
there
is
a
ton
of
citrus
with
some
grapefruit
and
pine
resin
the
malt
is
kept
way
in
the
background
this
area
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bells
two
hearted
ale
the
taste
is
of
a
lot
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
there
is
still
a
very
nice
hops
presence
but
it
is
moderated
by
some
nice
pale
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
will
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
in
the
future
drinkability
is
the
key
for
this
style
st
lupulin
isnt
a
bad
one
but
its
a
little
too
mild
for
me
extradrinkable
this
hopforward
epa
i
might
choose
this
over
a
summit
epa
but
wouldnt
pick
one
over
an
ipa
thats
me
though
very
nice
epa
suitable
for
many
occasions
nice
pale
with
a
solid
hop
kick
but
little
else
d
this
might
be
my
perfect
summer
beer
loads
of
hops
in
a
refreshing
dry
finish
this
beer
is
a
session
beer
for
those
who
love
big
hop
aromas
and
flavors
overall
a
very
nice
apa
that
had
a

be

intro

newbies
juts
like
snpa
is

for
this

light

and
lack
of

keeps
this
from
being
an
ipa
top
10
apa
for
sure
its
a
decent
enjoyable
beer
but
given
the
price
of
it
here
as
an
import
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
poured
a
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
kinda
soapy
with
really
faint
hops
and
had
more
of
a
hop
character
there
was
also
slight
wheat
and
citrus
notes
up
front
malts
dominate
the
taste
very
little
hop
bitterness
and
very
little
citurs
wheat
flavors
the
beer
was
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
that
had
slight
hop
bitterness
but
was
crisp
on
the
finish
i
think
the
brew
was
a
little
old
cause
it
was
more
maltier
than
it
was
hoppy
but
then
again
it
was
only
a
pale
ale
it
atill
drank
quite
welll
and
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
bite
12
ounce
bottle
great
to
see
st
lupulin
back
on

shelves
odell
always
has
terrific
bottle
art
but
i
think
this
one
is
exceptional
with
the
glass
of
beer
formed
by
the
negative
space
in
the
picture
pours
a
nice
light
gold
amber
with
a
ful
inch
head
the
consistency
of
quality
dish
soap
incredibly
resinous
nose
with
plenty
of
hop
aroma
pine
grass
and
some
grapefruit
abounds
hops
are
present
throughout
the
beer
theres
pine
and
grass
up
front
with
some
surprising
bitterness
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
before
finishing
with
citrus
fruit
theres
no
real
complexity
here
though
theres
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
thisis
is
a
beer
thats
very
straightforward
on
the
palate
and
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing

this

just

just

slainte
d
incredible
it
is
complex
yet
refreshing
with
a
delicious
hoppy
flavor
that
really
lives
up
the
extra
pale
ale
moniker
given
to
it
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
one
that
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
throughout
the
summer
crisp
hoppy
bite
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
earthy
pine
and
resin
malts
are
restrained
but
bring
enough
balance
to
even
out
all
the
hoppiness
body
is
bubbly
and
light
on
the
palate
and
finishes
clean
and
hoppy
odell
knows
how
to
brew
solid
drinkable
beers
and
st
lupulin
is
no
exception
recommended
drinks
like
a
day
spent
watching
the
clouds
like
those
puffy
wanderers
st
lupulin
becomes
complex
upon
deeper
contemplation
with
flavors
evoking
images
of
flowers
and
sunshine
its
a
fantastic
beer
for

one
from

nothing

a

for

a

definitely
enjoyable
and
something

the

this

is

i
could

drinkability
this
beer
was
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
the
wheat
colored
brownish
beer
created
a
fair
amount
of
foam
yet
reduced
to
low
amounts
of
lacing
giving
off
the
evidence
of
not
having
tons
of
hops
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
great
sweater
amounts
of
malts
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
an
equal
amounts
of
hops
and
malts
with
a
fair
flavoring
coriander
this
is
a
great
anytime
beer
they
are
advertising
it
as
a
seasonal
and
thats
too
bad
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
d
wow
one
of
the
easiest
hoppy
beers
ive
had
to
drink
not
overly
bitter
and
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
great
summer
seasonal
and
really
a
nice
beer
makes
me
wonder
if
an
xpa
should
be
a
classification
not
quite
a
pale
ale
but
not
quite
an
ipa
trough
the
roof
sessionability
i
sure
hope
this
stays
in
the
rotation
one
of
the
better
apas
not
including
aipas
calling
themselves
apas
out
there
imho
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
if
odell
chose
to
make
this
a
yearround
offering
they
could
ship
a
few
cases
out
to
kansas
every
month
to
a
very
happy
home
and
palate
odells
knows
how
to
make
an
enjoyable
beer
and
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
crisp
and
refreshing
borderline
ipa
but
not
too
overwhelming
on
the
abv
to
be
hard
to
put
down
a
few
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
wateriness
in
the
middle
was
the
only
thing
getting
in
the
way
of
my
enjoyment
definitely
worth
a
revisit
d
from
the
title
of
the
beer
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
tad
more
hoppy
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
nothing
that
really
smacks
me
over
the
head
and
amazes
me
but
drinkable
and
would
have
another
odells
makes
great
beer
bottle

a
clear
light

with

thick

very
hoppy
with
lots

is
slightly
more
mellow
with
tropical
fruits
and
citrus

pretty
hoppy
for
an
apa
it
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
very
delicious
d
this
is
a
really
good
apa
i
took
a
sixer
of
it
to
a
barbeque
and
found
it
to
be
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
great
apa
definitely
a
must
try
the
beer
is
suprisingly
light
for
the
amount
of
flavor
it
packs
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
ill
pay
it
though
carbonated
a
bit
to
much
but
not
to
distract
drinks
incredibly
easy
for
a
good
summer
seasonal
another
great
beer
from
odell
drinkability
just
another
hoppy
bitter
apa
that
i
dont
think
ill
visit
that
often
i
ask
the
singular
most
important
question
comparing
this
to
the
draft
version
wheres
the
malt
na
26x
a
quality
seasonal
from
the
folks
at
odell
im
always
a
sucker
for
a
citrusy
ipa
what
a
fantastic
year
for
colorado
beer
keep
em
coming
boys
dextremely
enjoyable
and
definitely
sessionable
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavors
didnt
come
together
well
enough
for
me
d
extremely
drinkable
especially
at
6
5
a
wonderful
new
release
from
odells
my
new
favorite
summer
brew
well
done
dabsolutely
delightful
a
great
summer
beer
good
for
those
not
looking
for
bitter
but
still
want
refreshing
will
be
picking
up
at
least
another
2
six
packs
cost
is
not
terribly
low
though
at
10
99
yet
well
worth
it
in
my
opinion
especially
compared
to
other
6
packs
in
that
price
range
around
here
first
off
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
beer
is
a
little
too
expensive
at
10
a
sixer
but
that
is
the
nature
of
beer
prices
these
days
very
nice
transparent
orange
color
kind
of
looks
like
the
ipa
but
doesnt
have
the
same
level
of
lacing
to
it
the
smell
is
quite
nice
and
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
like
straight
hop
oil
the
taste
is
good
slightly
bitter
finish
a
little
citrus
lemon
specifically
this
is
a
very
nice
extra
pale
ale
and
i
would
be
buying
it
on
the
regular
if
it
were
more
competitively
priced
sadly
this
will
be
like
the
red
ale
for
me
once
in
a
blue
moon
this
is
an
incredible
summer
session
beer
if
you
can
get
this
get
it
a
familiar
sweet
smell
of
odells
hop
profile
a
bit
of
maltiness
in
there
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
combined
with
the
sweetness
of
the
hops
and
malt
and
creates
a
good
balance
not
the
bite
of
their
ipa
which
i
love
and
which
makes
this
a
bit
more
drinkable
once
again
odells
has
produced
an
incredibly
balanced
and
quality
beer
i
am
lucky
that
i
live
in
ftc
d
very
good
drinkability
has
a
very
nice
hop
profile
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
solid
new
seasonal
offering
from
odell
they
have
yet
to
let
me
down
overall
its
another
great
beer
from
odell
and
an
outstanding
summer
seasonal
had
on
draft
this
time
always
a
good
choice
other
time
ive
had
in
can
i
had
high
expectations
opening
up
a
can
of
this
stuff
it
was
recommended
to
me
because
i
wanted
to
try
a
new
pale
ale
its
very
boring
and
leaves
a
strange
taste
in
your
mouth
with
that
said
i
would
still
drink
it
over
alot
of
other
shit
the
wife
snarled
at
the
can
but
ended
up
loving
it
there
you
have
it

in

tastes
a

metallic
feel
and
foams
up
somewhat
in

overall
i
love
this
pale
ale
it
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
fell
in
love
with
years
ago
and
this
is
the
first
ive
had
it
in
a
long
time
though
its
not
as
complex
as
it
probably
could
be
it
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorites
an

ones
ive
had

i
was
honestly
going
into
this
beer
already
disapointed
because
2
of
my
3
previously
tried
out
of
a
make
your
own
6pack
were
very
disapointing
1
was
another
well
known
pale
ale
from
another
craft
beer
giant
the
other
was
a
canned
beer
boy
was
i
surprised
this
is
a
good
beer
pours
an
orangegold
body
with
a
mountain
of
frothy
foam
the
smell
was
floral
and
piny
with
some
citrus
the
taste
reflects
this
with
the
addition
of
some
sweet
malts
overall
a
delicious
beer
that
i
definitely
see
myself
drinking
in
the
future
but
with
that
said
there
are
a
few
critiques
firstly
i
felt
there
was
too
much
bitterness
with
not
enough
hop
flavor
if
that
makes
sense
like
there
was
a
lot
of
just
generic
bitterness
with
not
too
much
distinct
hop
flavors
secondly
the
packaging
needs
to
be
updated
although
i
got
only

use

they
look

you

this

put
some
in

chug
it

one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary

very
good
holy

this
beer
is
underrated
the
perfect
beer
with

pale
ale
has
a
smooth
taste
that
gets
some
hops
towards
the
end
but
it
is
blended
wonderfully
so
it
isnt
at
all
harsh
drank
it
straight
from
the

solid
stuff
good

good
pale
ale
would
drink
it
again
heard
it
was
a
good
beer
but
wasnt
impressed
when
i
tried
it
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
reasonably
priced
at
3
99
its
almost
an
ipa
with
the
hop
profile
i
prefer
sn
pale
ale
but
this
was
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
pale
ale
or
ipa
pours

balanced
with

citrus

pith
hop
bitterness
only
slight
deviation
from
start
to
finish
but
bitterness
becomes
high
octane
immediately
after
the

dominates
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
clean
silky
smooth
drying
in
the
aftertaste
a
simple
straightforward
ipa
that
is
called
a
pale
ale
a
rich
pale
ale
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
one
of
those
beers
that
really
makes
sense
in
a
can
ive
been
a
fan
of
oskar
blues
but
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
great
beer
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
day
or
until
i
pass
out
one
of
my
gotos
great
pale
ale
with
enough
ibus
to
be
considered
an
ipa
easy
drinking
but
full
of
flavor
slightly
piney
with
citrus
very
solid
deep
amber
colored
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
leaves
brussels
lacing
delicate
aroma
of
piney
hops
takes
a
backseat
in
comparison
to
the
toasted
nutty
accented
malt
the
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
light
to
nutty
malt
flavor
and
the
gentle
piney
hop
note
the
body
is
lightvery
smoothand
very
dry
a
colorado
classic
dales
pale
is
still
great
o
pleasant
refreshing
not
filling
not
amazing
but
very
drinkable
could
be
considered
a
minimalist
ipa
outstanding
my
favorite
pale
this
was
served
in
a
19
ounce
can
believe
it
or
not
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
made
a
decent
head
it
is
reasonably
hopped
but
not
as
hop
heavy
as
many
ipas
or
apas
for
that
matter
i
would
buy
it
again
especially
if
i
can
find
that
extra
large
can
all
american
pale
ale
not
much
else
to
say
other
then
if
you
dont
like
it
at
first
give
it
a
second
chance
if
you
still
dont
like
it
after
that
clearly
your
taste
buds
cant
handle
the
bitter
bomb
this
beer
is
my
woman
and
is
session
beer
first
time
i
had
it
i
wasnt
a
fan
but
as
i
got
more
and
more
i
kept
coming
back
this
aint
your
average
pale
ale
its
bong
bong
ill
drink
this
anytime
anywhere
if
you
havent
got
this
yet
and
you
like
hops
you
are
missing
out
on
life
oskar
blues
never
lets
down
with
their
3d
beers
in
a
can
buy
it
shotgun
one
enjoy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
tasting
blind
theres
no
way
i
would
know
it
was
a
pale
instead
of
an
ipa
love
those
centennial
hops
some
things
in
common
with
hoppy
ambers
even
including
a
little
rough
edge
glad
these
guys
started
distributing
to
mn
last
summer
very
nice
addition
an
incredebly
tasty
and
hoppy
american
pale
ale
i
really
like
the
drinkability
of
it
pours
with
a
two
fingers
of
mottle
white
head
roasted
malt
and
citrus
notes
starts
sweet
and
finishes
bitter
very
drinkable
very
fruity
yet
very
hoppy
not
weak
this
certainly
wasnt
strong
by
any
stretch
either
the
alcohol
gave
this
a
bit
of
warming
but
didnt
detract
from
the
range
of
flavors
that
this
packed
this
was
a
classic
textbook
example
of
what
an
american
pale
ale
should
be
while
not
falling
prey
to
the
arms
race
that
so
many
west
coast
counterparts
of
this
fall
victim
to
its
a
good
thing
that
this
beer
is
available
yearround
as
it
can
be
enjoyed
and
would
fit
well
in
any
season
complex
balanced
and
true
to
style
this
is
an
apa
that
deserves
a
higher
rating
than
what
it
has
on
here
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
white
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
really
nice
with
some
sweet
notes
in
the
beginning
and
then
a
lot
of
pine
from
the
hops
coming
through
in
the
end
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
scent
with
sweet
malt
in
the
beginning
and
a
crisp
finish
a
very
well
balanced
beer
another
go
to
favorite
i
love
cans
what
can
i
say
its
gotten
more
consistant
holds
up
better
from
nc
opposed
to
co
product
in
my
opinion
great
beer
malty
wo
being
too
sticky
perfect
hop
bitterness
to
balance
i
like
sucking
down
a
few
dales
great
beer
with
a
nice
alcohol
content
for
a
breskie
lil
to
hoppy
unless
they
produce
a
hoppier
one
for
me
personally
23
of
them
is
enough
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
swilled
more
than
four
of
them
at
a
sitting
always
an
occasional
go
too
though
fer
sure
cheers
apparently
i
liked
it
enough
to
snap
a
picture
of
it
on
my
phone
too
bad
i
tried
it
after
a
long
night
out
on
the
town
pint
enjoyed
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
orangeyellow
amber
with
a
finger
of
light
beige
foam
incredibly
fruity
nose
all
kinds
of
things
going
on
including
orange
mango
peach
strawberry
kiwi
guava
all
blending
together
to
yield
a
gummy
bear
effect
wonderful
hop
aroma
than
can
keep
up
with
many
fullfledged
ipas
palate
was
more
classically
pale
ale
however
assuming
one
can
truly
split
hairs
like
this
a
smooth
caramel
backbone
with
the
hops
still
bold
but
not
aggressive
everything
wellintegrated
to
yield
a
pleasant
but
mellow
grapefruit
floral
and
tropical
fruit
melody
mouthfeel
slightly
oily
and
smooth
moderate
body
and
carbonation
finishes
quite
dry
almost
woody
bitterness
is
notable
great
concoction
this
even
if
the
nose
does
trump
the
palate
by
a
wide
margin
solid
pale
ale
and
i
dont
care
for
pale
ales
i
was
very
excited
to
give
the
spirit
go
shouldve
realized
that
my
excitement
stemmed
from
the
recommendations
of
my
west
coast
hophead
friends
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
sierra
nevada
in
fact
lately
i
am
a
fan
of
chesapeake
pale
ale
from
alewerks
excellent
flavor
usually
affordable
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
after
receiving
a
free
shirt
from
them
the
other
day
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
im
encouraged
to
try
more
oscar

beers
fun
redwhiteblue

good
heavy

start
with
the
substantial
hops
coming
through
about
halfway
into
the
sip
strong
citrus
dominates
the
palate
until
the
swallow
then
a
crisp
slightly
bitter
finish
very
quaffable
a
strong
go
to
apa
with
more
hops
than
average
solid
pale
ale
best
out
of
a
can
honestly
o
pretty
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
one
great
apa
good
pale
ale
but
not
my
favorite
alcohol
could
be
better
hidden
i
get
a
little
spice
in
the
taste
i
enjoy
that
tasty
malt
backbone
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
the
nose
is
mostly
orange
citrus
with
tropical
notes
theres
a
good
presence
of
caramel
malt
too
the
flavor
is
nice
very
big
malt
presence
but
its
balanced
with
strong
hops
there
is
something
peppery
and
a
strong
taffy
flavor
balance
is
the
name
of
the
game
nice
thick
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
i
consider
this
more
of
an
ipa
honestly
this
brew
is
all
about
the
hops
i
would
recommend
if
you
are
into
big
hops
o
very
solid
beer
surprised
that
i
never
had
it
until
now
dales
is
the
biggest
seller
for
oskar
blues
and
as
a
hoppy
apa
that
most
people
think
of
when
they
think
of
a
craft
beer
i
see
why
its
just
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
i
certainly
enjoy
one
now
and
then
im
just
not
quite
as
enthused
about
this
one
as
most
people
i
know
though
i
would
get
this
brew
again
overall
a
4
for
dales
pale
ale
oskar
blues
grill
brew
i
may
buy
this
brew
again
my
go
too
hoppy
beer
overall
a
well
crafted
apa
with
a
nice
punch
from
the
grassy
hops
and
caramalt
sweetness
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
long
time
want
o
favorite
pale
ale
so
far
nothing
beats
the
sticky
pinyness
that
this
beer
has
potent
hops
potent
malts
good
if
you
want
a
beer
to
punch
you
in
the
face
in
a
can
and
usually
midrange
pricewise
an
above
average
pale
pucker
up
because
this
is
one
strong
can
of
brew
the
hard
htting
hops
and
powerful
finish
make
is
a
really
fun
drink
the
top
of
the
can
lets
you
know
what
you
are
in
for
as
you
kick
this
one
back
they
got
this
one
right

really
smooth
for
the

and
for
being
a
pale

nice

when
poured
can

taste
resides
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
moving
to

upper
palate
on
swallow
aftertaste
minimal
little
lingering
head
seems
to

quickly
clean
taste

would
buy
again
pairs
well
with
a
tobacco
vape
blend
like
axioms
honeysuckle
tobacco
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
ive
seen
this
all
over
in
cans
but
never
ventured
try
it
this
is
not
quite
a
revelation
but
it
does
make
me
pinch
myself
for
my
trepidation
nice
copper
color
staunch
head
wa
lacing
that
indicates
a
respect
in
the
process
not
much
aroma
but
a
very
full
balanced
flavor
this
is
pretty
much
my
level
of
hop
tolerence
but
i
dont
mind
it
one
bit
now
to
find
a
singular
can
to
complete
the
research
this
is
my
go
to
beer
great
caramel
color
with
a
nice
sized
head
the
smell
is
just
what
an
ipa
should
smell
like
unlike
southern
tier
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
its
also
now
available
in
target
which
makes
going
there
a
little
bit
better
pack
it
in
and
pack
it
out
cod

pours
a
clear
almost
medium
amber
with
a
nice
dark
ruby
tint
tremendous
head
with
excellent
lacing
and
retention
very
nice
nose
of
tropical
citrus
hops
over
a
pine
and
light
caramel
background
medium
body
with
an
almost
slick
texture
above
average
carbonation
with
a
nice
effervescent
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
blend
of
hop
flavors
found
in
the
nose
then
rapidly
flows
to
a
pine
focused
hop
bitterness
over
a
slightly
tart
note
as
the
bitterness
fades
a
light
caramel
sweetness
emerges
in
the
effervescent
finish
a
tart
pine
bitterness
with
hints
of
spice
lingers
not
a
professional
but
pretty
darn
close
cheers
fellers
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
i
wish
was
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
says
pale
ale
but
voluminously
hopped
mutha
of
a
pale
ale
on
the
top
of
the
can
is
more
accurate
check
this
out
if
you
like
tossing
up
the
differences
between
sierra
nevada
and
siera
nevada
torpedo
o
not
what
i
expected
in
fact
much
better
than
i
expected
hoppy
and
complexity
mix
to
create
a
wonderful
flavor
profile
and
the
texture
compliments
the
taste
very
well
rjt
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
these
while
grabbing
some
of
my
my
go
to
old
chub
also
a
big
fan
of
ten
fidy
and
not
sure
why
i
have
never
had
this
one
but
had
to
give
it
a
go
outstanding
looking
beer
with
an
excellent
nose
clean
and
i
fresh
disappointed
with
the
taste
it
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
quite
the
level
of
other
oskar
blues
offerings
o
pretty
darn
good
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
but
still
good
taste
more
on
the
ipa
range
but
excellent
nonetheless
i
really
like
the
smooth
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
and
will
buy
again
at
6
5
abv
and
over
200
cals
will
not
be
drinking
and
pounding
but
great
for
a
shorter
nite
of
drinking
o
not
a
terribly
exciting
malt
profile
more
hop
forward
nice
hop
flavor
but
not
overly
complex
a
good
malt
backbone
and
a
very
nice
simple
hop
profile
it
seems
like
a
one
trick
pony
but
its
a
really
good
trick
definitely
a
great
beer
to
cool
down
with
o
hoppier
than
expected
and
really
almost
more
of
an
ipa
to
me
apart
from
not
being
that
bitter
i
hope
the
berry
flavor
im
getting
isnt
from
some
shandy
or
something
they
had
on
the
line
before
an
excellent
well
balanced
apa
has
floral
notes
balanced
with
apple
cinnamon
malt
and
some
lemony
overtones
lacing
very
nice
with
good
head
retention
good
hop
to
malt
balance
easy
drinking
session
ale
taught
me
that
canned
beer
need
not
taste
bad
my
example
was
brewed
in
brevard
nc
fresh
one
of
the
best
session
apa
beers
on
the
expensive
side
for
what
it
is
id
drink
this
ale
again
offends
in
no
area
i
scored
a
19
5
oz
can
at
pinocchios
in
media
dated
6232014
so
its
pretty
fresh
that
having
been
said
ive
noticed
a
few
differences
between
the
19
5
and
12
oz
cans
first
of
all
it
has
a
darker
complexion
not
much
darker
but
enough
to
be
noticable
second
it
smells
richer
like
theres
a
little
more
to
it
then
the
12
oz
version
third
my
wife
and
i
split
a
can
so
we
each
got
about
10
oz
and
it
had
considerably
more
kick
to
it
than
a
12
oz
can
finally
there
was
way
more
malt
and
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
the
12
oz
version
i
could
see
a
couple
of
my
i
dont
like
ipa
friends
drinking
this
and
enjoying
it
very
good
all
around
and
if
i
could
get
it
here
regularly
for
less
than
5
a
can
this
would
be
my
goto
beer
instead
of
the
12
oz
cans
or
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
overall
a
really
fine
yearround
american
ipa
not
a
pale
ale
or
session
beer
for
my
taste
one
can
is
more
than
enough
for
me
kind
of
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
pale
ale
but
this
is
a
bit
heavier
and
not
in
a
good
way
its
like
they
were
trying
too
hard
not
to
be
too
light
the
6
5
is
a
nice
perk
would
drink
again
not
a
bad
flavor
occasionally
o
a
forgetful
pale
ale
needs
more
malt
to
balance
the
hops
not
really
tasty
the
date
shown
said
it
was
pretty
fresh
so
not
sure
why
it
was
so
average
many
other
beers
out
there
so
may
as
well
skip
this
one
solid
brew
that
is
worth
keeping
in
the
fridge
though
perhaps
not
as
hypeworthy
as
those
from
co
think
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
pours
dark

head
retention
is
good
with
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
side
of
the
glass
has
a
citrusy
resin
aroma
malty
excellent
malty
backbone
to
this
beer
starts
with
a
moderate
resin
like
hoppy
taste
followed
by
an
very
smooth
malty
citrus
taste
good
amount
of
bitter
aftertaste
follows
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
hops
and
malts
are
well
balanced
o
if
you
want
a
more
east
coast
style
ipa
this
is
a
good
starter
the
abv
is
not
too
high
and
the
bitterness
is
in
check
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
pine
or
floral
notes
in
the
taste
they
are
in
the
nose
it
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
and
you
could
easily
enjoy
several
on
a
hot
day
i
know
a
lot
of
bas
say
this
is
an
ipa
but
i
dont
think
so
its
perfectly
balanced
between
sweet
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
its
light
and
highly
drinkable
its
been
my
brew
on
many
fishing
and
camping
trips
solid
all
around
m
medium
carbonation
finishes
medium
dry
it
smells
like
any
other
normal
beer
but
the
taste
is
so
terrible
almost
like
it
has
a
vicious
metallic
bite
to
it
very
very
hard
to
go
down
would
not
buy
for
myself
would
not
recommend
to
friends
just
just
dont
this
apa
pours
a
copper
amber
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
average
lacing
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
notes
of
pine
herbs
and
citrus
there
is
also
a
sweet
caramely
malt
backbone
the
mouth
is
the
perfect
balance
of
sticky
and
light
and
easy
drinking
the
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
blend
of
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
all
in
all
a
very
easy
to
drink
well
made
apa
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tulip
pours
a
deep
red
amber
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
foam
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
retention
i
picked
up
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
piney
hop
goodness
tastes
fairly
boozy
in
a
delightful
way
lots
of
nice
hoppy
piney
notes
that
leave
me
wondering
where
the
boundaries
of
ipas
and
apas
are
drawn
very
rich
mouthfeel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
that
balances
everything
just
right
i
love
this
beer
o
a
decent
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
giant
can
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
your
buck
you
just
cant
go
wrong
for
this
price
and
the
style
this
is
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
this
tastes
great
feels
great
refreshing
any
time
of
year
o
this
works
for
me
i
would
drink
this
over
other
similar
pale
ales
that
i
think
are
attemping
the
same
thing
sierra
nevada
is
the
comparison
right
now
having
grown
up
in
northern
california
ill
tell
you
that
this
blows
it
away
not
that
clean
and
citrusy
pale
you
might
want
a
little
unrefined
even
but
sometimes
that
malt
backing
is
a
good
thing
a
nice
beer
overall
if
this
was
labeled
an
ipa
i
wouldnt
have
thought
twice
about
it
which
is
why
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
apas
and
i
think
is
one
of
the
better
readily
available
beers
in
the
style
also
light
on
the
wallet
being
found
on
sale
regularly
for
around
2628
a
case
in
my
area
which
makes
for
a
great
goto
its
full
bodied
and
the
flavor
is
balanced
cant
go
wrong
with
a
dales
flavor
bready
malts
nicely
balancing
the
cirtus
rind
and
grapefruit
of
the
hops
there
is
some
toasted
bread
flavor
caramel
nicely
crafted
ale
on
tap
with
a
table
full
of
bbq
poured
from
a
can
with
a
nice
head
and
a
golden
brown
sugar
color
fruity
hops
on
the
nose
but
the
fruit
is
more
subdued
with
the
initial
taste
well
balanced
with
malt
notes
and
a
subdued
bitterness
an
enjoyable
brew
final
grade
4
17
an
excellent
a
dales
pale
ale
is
a
testament
to
the
superiority
of
the
can
this
particular
one
is
over
8
months
old
and
still
drinking
supremely
well
its
a
heftier
apa
at
6
5
but
its
still
a
very
solid
hoppy
sessionish
ale
and
a
brew
that
i
plan
to
try
fresh
at
some
point
in
the
future
no
one
satisfies
the
hopheads
better
than
our
neighbours
to
the
south
and
this
is
one
of
the
benchmarks
in
its
style
for
good
reason
o
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
very
easy
drinking
and
definetly
recommended
odales
pale
ale
should
be
the
go
to
beer
for
any
occasion
it
should
replace
all
bmc
brews
as
americas
flagship
beer
i
can
see
and
understand
if
dales
is
someones
favorite
beer
and
it
gives
impetus
for
all
breweries
to
offer
canned
versions
of
their
flagship
brews
because
freshness
is
unmatched
in
a
can
great
apa
pours
a
23
finger
head
has
a
very
citrisy
and
hoppy
smell
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
an
average
at
best
beer
but
boy
was
i
wrong
i
grabbed
a
6
pack
at
my
local
beer
distributor
guy
behind
the
counter
knows
me
pretty
well
and
asked
me
if
i
was
sure
i
wanted
to
buy
this
after
getting
home
and
cracking
open
a
can
after
dinner
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
was
surprised
at
how
well
it
poured
lots
of
lacing
and
a
great
orangeamber
color
once
i
took
a
sip
i
couldnt
believe
what
i
had
just
drank
this
beer
came
out
of
a
can
before
i
knew
it
the
glass
was
empty
and
i
had
a
smile
on
my
face
overall
a
really
solid
apa
i
get
the
cult
following
definitely
going
to
take
this
one
hiking
had
this
brew
awhile
ago
was
the
second
beer
ive
ever
had
pretty
much
became
the
reason
i
decided
to
learn
more
about
craft
beer
so
glad
i
got
to
start
out
with
a
great
tasting
solid
beer
i
got
to
experience
this
great
tasting
pleasent
and
enjoyable
beer
at
the
friendly
spot
ice
house
in
san
antonio
texas
it
pours
hazey
yellow
with
thin
white
laces
running
to
the
finger
width
head
it
has
a
real
strong
hop
tatste
for
being
a
pale
ale
not
to
over
bearing
though
goes
down
smooth
leaves
your
palte
dry
wanting
more
i
think
it
is
a
halloween
party
in
the
can
becuase
taste
like
a
ipa
in
a
pale
ales
costume
poured
from
the
can
it
has
a
golden
orange
color
body
with
small
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
hops
the
taste
is
straight
hop
forward
then
towards
the
back
it
has
a
little
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
leaves
a
little
hop
aftertaste
overall
it
is
a
good
pale
ale
man
they
nailed
it
this
is
really
something
special
the
pour
is
a
hazy
golden
almost
like
a
hefeweissen
beautiful
white
head
aroma
is
fresh
hops
the
taste
is
just
wonderful
it
starts
sweet
and
just
when
you
think
this
beer
will
be
too
sweet
the
hops
kick
but
not
overpowering
the
after
taste
is
heaven
a
perfect
balance
of
malty
sweetness
and
hop
dryness
this
tastes
like
a
really
really
good
homebrew
that
is
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
any
beer
o
i
had
a
shorty
at
the
yard
house
in
lynfield
ma
thought
this
beer
was
very
good
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
dark
yellowlight
orange
the
head
lingers
in
the
pitcher
and
laces
but
fails
to
do
so
in
the
glass
i
couldnt
pick
up
too
much
aroma
because
i
had
this
at
a
bar
that
allows
smoking
i
picked
up
some
sweetness
along
with
pine
and
citrus
it
tastes
slightly
sweet
upfront
followed
by
a
piney
and
fruity
bitterness
that
lingers
its
really
bitter
for
a
pale
ale
almost
borderline
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
its
not
outstanding
but
it
is
good
o
the
perfect
little
pale
ale
no
wonder
its
so
popular
great
for
any
occasion
an
easy
drinker
ooverall
a
solid
pale
ale
a
go
to
everyday
beer
for
me
this
is
so
good
beer
i
keep
coming
back
over
and
over
again
great
beer
this
was
my
beer
for
the
super
bowl
this
year
after
four
it
made
my
motherinlaw
much
more
tolerable
its
a
solid
pale
ale
most
american
pales
seem
to
overhop
in
an
attempt
to
leach
off
the
popularity
of
their
cooler
brother
ipa
dales
pale
ale
seems
to
stay
true
to
the
style
and
for
that
im
thankful
final
thoughts
living
in
mn
means
that
summit
epa
is
the
standard
that
all
other
pale
ales
are
judged
against
dales
pale
ale
is
the
first
of
the
style
ive
tasted
that
is
comparable
to
summit
epa
the
great
balance
of
flavors
in
dales
pale
ale
makes
it
one
to
remember
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
a
solid
pale
ale
i
get
hints
of
something
really
good
but
they
battle
with
or
give
way
to
less
enjoyable
elements
tastelightly
toasted
maltfruity
hopswhite
grapefruit
bitterness
that
carries
to
the
finish
nice
flavor
and
balance
tasty
and
portable
o
definitely
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
tasty
but
again
more
tropical
fruit
would
be
better
definitely
recommended
o
i
have
eyed
this
beer
for
a
while
now
but
always
passed
on
it
because
of
the
can
found
a
single
so
i
bit
im
kind
of
underwhelmed
unfortunately
it
has
a
taste
that
doesnt
agree
with
me
in
trying
to
be
fair
it
is
balanced
nicely
and
easy
to
drink
ill
probably
pass
on
this
beer
in
the
future
there
are
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
because
its
the
first
time
ive
seen
it
in
indiana
and
ive
heard
lots
about
it
but
i
just
dont
care
for
it
its
not
bad
but
its
not
really
good
either
just
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
that
thousands
of
breweries
seem
to
make
nothing
special
o
a
great
apa
with
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
one
of
my
favorite
goto
pale
ales
and
the
blind
score
reflects
and
solidifies
that
for
me
out
of
a
total
of
14
pale
ales
in
the
blind
tasting
this
brew
tied
for
1st
with
4
others
on
my
list
and
ended
up
at
2nd
on
the
collaborative
list
perfect
for
around
the
campfire
ultimately
i
liked
this
beer
and
would
consider
getting
it
again
when
looking
for
a
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
staple
goto
when
cans
are
the
required
derigour
with
all
the
other
cans
available
now
this
is
the
one
i
know
i
will
find
along
side
yeungling
cans
if
this
is
out
when
all
there
is
available
is
substandard
canned
swill
otherwise
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
but
with
no
outlandish
tricks
like
crazy
amounts
of
hops
or
alcohol
good
stuff
even
if
it
is
rather
potent
by
pale
ale
standards
snpa
this
is
not
looks
ok
though
a
more
persistent
head
would
be
nice
the
aroma
and
flavour
beat
your
senses
into
submission
with
a
huge
pine
overdose
while
the
malt
takes
a
backseat
decent
body
but
enhanced
carbonation
would
improve
the
texture
a
beer
that
wont
be
ignored
definitely
one
for
the
hopheads
worth
sampling
if
you
chance
across
it
i
got
hooked
on
dales
pale
ale
by
a
neighbor
who
let
me
try
some
at
a
party
ive
always
been
a
hop
head
and
dales
fits
the
bill
perfectly
the
bitterness
hoppiness
isnt
overwhelming
but
yet
theres
still
a
good
bite
and
lightness
to
it
i
also
love
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
cans
it
brings
back
fond
memories
as
a
kid
when
i
would
sneak
sips
of
my
parents
canned
beer
o
a
damn
good
pale
ale
its
very
different
for
a
pale
ale
but
its
great
o
a
solid
pale
ale
goes
down
fast
o
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
which
has
a
very
well
balanced
out
taste
characters
very
good
to
have
with
a
couple
of
buddies
or
when
youre
looking
to
relax
i
like
it
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
quite
nice
this
is
a
style
that
its
easy
to
get
mediocre
with
theres
a
lot
of
okay
american
pale
ales
out
there
while
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
timeless
classic
or
anything
this
is
certainly
better
than
okay
i
get
this
in
the
can
often
from
the
brevard
nc
brewery
not
colorado
different
water
so
this
review
surmises
the
beer
across
multiple
tastings
as
with
many
apas
it
is
best
when
fresher
recently
i
have
been
getting
it
as
fresh
as
one
week
and
as
old
as
1
5
months

heady
topper
it
is
not
on
that
level
but
that
is
a
hard
level
to
achieve
and
i
rate
this
beer
consistantly
just
below
them
i
highly
recommend
especially
when
fresh
check
the
date
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
o
this
is
an
awesome
apa
if
this
was
sold
in
case
form
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
full
time
super
session
able
and
refreshing
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
fresh
i
really
cant
think
of
a
pale
ale
that
i
have
enjoyed
more
d
go
for
it
good
stuff
nice
flavor
rewarding
buzz
all
good
here
solid
pale
ale
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
great
to
bring
tailgating
or
to
outdoor
events
etc
drinks
well
out
of
the
can
as
well
tried
a
sixpack
on
my
sons
recommendation
against
my
better
judgement
this
is
a
very
bitter
metallictasting
brew
there
are
strong
hints
of
pine
and
frankly
my
first
instinct
was
to
spit
our
the
first
sip
this
is
typically
a
very
high
priced
beer
although
i
found
it
at
my
grocery
store
substantially
discounted
i
remember
liking
this
better
in
years
past
wish
the
flavoring
hops
were
more
prevalent
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
light
amber
color
clear
with
minimal
head
very
nice
hoppy
aroma
some
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
this
brew
has
a
very
balanced
flavor
profile
but
it
has
a
generous
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
some
nice
piney
notes
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
its
just
thick
enough
to
keep
you
drinking
it
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
that
was
hard
to
put
down
i
finished
it
pretty
quick
and
i
think
i
will
crack
another
ogood
beer
i
bought
a
mixed
12
pack
looking
forward
to
the
rest
decent
tasting
pale
ale
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
when
in
the
mood
although
i
did
find
the
11
99
price
tag
for
a
6
pack
of
12
ounce
cans
a
bit
much
a
person
can
find
pale
ales
equal
to
this
one
or
better
from
a
variety
of
brewers
for
under
ten
bucks
in
any
liquor
store
o
good
example
of
an
apa
no
complaints
o
this
is
a
fantastically
drinkable
beer
the
body
carbonation
and
clean
hop
flavor
never
get
old
oskar
blues
can
do
no
wrong
overall
a
very
unexpected
different
tasting
ale
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
its
one
id
drink
often
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
ingredients
were
combined
to
make
a
unique
and
damn
addictive
flavor
i
will
be
having
this
beer
many
more
times
to
come
there
are
lots
of
hops
in
this
one
that
pushes
it
on
the
verge
of
ipa
territory
dales
pale
ale
maintains
a
nice
hop
presence
while
staying
fresh
and
highly
satisfying
definitely
a
pale
ale
for
a
hop
head
and
maybe
too
much
hops
for
someone
looking
for
a
milder
pale
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
canned
beer
or
no
canned
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
cheers
overall
a
nice
pale
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
nicely
balanced
goes
down
smooth
tastes
good
an
outstanding
beer
probably
the
best
american
pale
ale
ive
tried
to
date
great
balance
between
the
sweet
caramel
malts
and
the
hop
filled
pine
and
tropical
fruit
notes
that
are
backed
up
with
a
solid
bitter
finish
one
that
did
not
disappoint
in
the
slightest
o
a
great
big
pale
ale
poured
into
a
mug
cause
its
all
i
had
frothy
head
with
a
copper
color
aroma
is
almost
stale
adjunct
maybe
a
result
of
the
mug
flavor
is
without
much
bitter
and
slightly
watered
down
malt
flavor
and
a
tinge
of
hops
didnt
finish
clean
medium
carbonation
session
beer
mouthfeel
ill
have
to
rerate
when
i
have
something
other
than
a
penguin
christmas
mug
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
pa
and
a
likely
goto
for
a
regular
fridge
stock
o
a
very
hoppy
apa
almost
so
much
that
its
probably
closer
to
an
ipa
but
man
is
this
well
put
together
basically
a
good
ipa
with
the
acidity
dialed
down
and
the
malts
dialed
up
all
the
components
compliment
each
other
nicely
i
could
easily
finish
a
sixer
of
this
and
not
get
tired
of
it
great
beer
to
have
with
friends
overall
a
welcome
change
from
the
west
coast
hop
bombs
im
used
to
running
into
but
not
a
beer
im
overly
enthusiastic
about
this
is
a
good
brew
and
makes
for
a
great
every
day
beer
its
neither
as
complicated
nor
satisfying
as
the
more
complex
apas
or
ipas
but
its
very
smooth
and
drinkable
serving
type
can
o
not
being
a
big
apa
drinker
i
found
this
quite
good
if
unexceptional
it
was
fullerfeeling
and
maltier
than
i
expected
and
i
found
this
to
be
favorable
for
me
utilitarian
recommended
without
reservation
or
hesitation
despite
the
packaging
bought
a
sixer
a
week
ago
and
i
keep
rerating
this
in
an
upward
direction
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
in
fact
for
a
apa
this
one
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
which
is
something
i
didnt
expect
but
is
growing
on
me
in
a
blind
taste
test
id
probably
label
this
an
ipa
compares
well
to
bells

great
beer
definitely
one
for
anyone
getting
into
craft
beers
to
try
its
a
great
example
of
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
pours
pure
apricot
with
a
thin
off
white
head
some
nice
orange
and
light
lemon
on
the
nose
some
slight
bready
malts
coming
in
behind
the
citrus
very
citrusy
for
a
pale
ale
smells
more
like
a
ipa
taste
is
on
the
lighter
side
the
citrus
is
faint
but
there
the
bready
malts
seem
stronger
then
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
light
very
very
drinkable
for
me
this
sits
just
above
the
middle
of
the
pack
of
craft
pale
ales
i
would
still
take
snpa
over
this
but
not
by
a
lot
its
just
fine
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
american
ipa
bonus
points
to
oskar
blues
for
cooking
up
one
of
these
thats
crystal
clear
i
mean
its
glass
man
and
thats
cool
but
in
the
current
craft
brew
scene
here
in
america
i
not
only
cant
say
anything
about
this
brew
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
other
coney
brews
its
simply
way
too
alcoholic
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
if
this
is
an
american
pale
ale
then
start
calling
me

with

is

goes

overall
a
very
good
beer
cool
can
i
would
rather
support
a
smaller
brewery
any
day
of
the
week
i
would
drink
this
again
but
id
know
what
i
was
getting
into
next
time
maybe
if
my
perspective
was
different
id
have
a
different
experience
plus
i
suck
at
golf
tons
of
flavor
but
easygoing
and
enjoyable
easily
found
almost
anywhere
but
nothing
to
be
ignored
quite
hoppy
for
an
apa
but
leaps
and
bounds
above
many
of
the
mediocre
ipas
out
there
a
great
beer
and
a
great
value
overall
this
is
a
highly
satisfying
and
refreshing
hoppy
pale
ale
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
sunny
day
it
lacks
the
range
of
hop
character
that
you
might
get
out
of
an
ipa
or
other
pale
ales
but
it
does
well
with
what
it
has
drinking
out
of
the
stovepipe
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
that
i
enjoy
with
regularity
its
a
bit
like
a
homecoming
for
me
and
i
enjoy
the
hoppy
inflexion
that
comes
with
each
swig
this
is
the
prototypical
colorado
ale
you
will
not
be
disappointed
unless
you
hate
hops
another
brew
ive
been
keen
to
try
and
it
pours
a
golden
copper
hue
with
a
billowing
four
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
citruspine
and
candy
and
to
be
honest
its
quite
subdued
to
what
i
was
expectingthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
caramel
candypiney
bitter
hopsvalencia
oranges
and
finished
with
a
light
citrus
bitterness
and
overall
its
very
sessionable
for
a
pale
ale
of
6
5
and
id
drink
it
again
cheers
the
feel
is
satisfying
light
moderately
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
a
fabulous
example
of
the
pale
ale
style
and
well
worth
the
experience
o
easy
drinking
solid
pale
ale
had
in
a
can
recently
they
just
came
to
michigan
in
march
dales
pale
ale
poured
burnished
copper
gold
in
color
and
stood
atop
a
nice
standing
and
lasting
foam
a
wonderful
sharp
citrus
nose
assertive
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
a
fully
attenuated
dry
finish
cheers
overall
not
very
bad
for
a
can
beer
at
all
its
hard
to
release
the
stigma
associated
with
the
can
but
this
is
good
beer
when
poured
into
a
glass
crisp
and
drinkable
solid
beer
i
feel
it
has
a
lot
of
similarities
to
a
lighter
ipa
less
sticky
more
grassy
a
lot
like
zombie
dust
or
daisy
cutter
overall
well
rounded
pale
ale
that
provides
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
cant
understand
why
its
not
rated
higher
than
it
is
this
is
definitely
a
pale
ale
to
seek
out
in
my
book
o
i
loved
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
i
went
out
the
next
day
and
bought
a
6
pack
of
it
which
i
rarely
buy
anything
aside
from
singles
now
a
days
i
recommend
it
especially
if
you
can
enjoy
2
weeks
old
cant
wait
to
try
oskar
blues
other
offerings
i
love
this
drink
it
tasts
more
like
an
ipa
but
ive
come
to
appreciate
that
some
apas
have
that
extra
hoppiness
that
can
lead
to
that
insistinction
is
that
really
a
word
its
extremely
well
balanced
fresh
and
i
cant
believe
that
it
comes
in
a
can
ive
had
both
tap
and
can
its
sweet
bitter
flavourful
and
the
same
in
a
can
or
draught
dpa
is
a
safe
choice
for
any
beer
advocate
and
should
not
be
missed
this
was
a
tremendous
hopped
up
pale
ale
that
is
not
the
usual
fare
it
was
fruity
and
bold
but
had
a
smooth
and
graceful
malt
easy
to
drink
and
really
made
you
wonder
if
this
was
an
ipa
had
a
winning
flavor
profile
that
did
not
try
to
clutter
the
palate
and
had
a
nice
mineral
quality
as
well
well
done
o
nothing
objectionable
but
this
isnt
doing
much
to
excite
me
hop
aroma
is
lower
than
id
like
and
the
alcohol
presence
should
be
lower
for
an
apa
although
the
listed
abv
is
actually
out
of
the
style
guidelines
slightly
overall
its
acceptable
but
if
im
in
the
mood
for
an
apa
i
cant
see
grabbing
cans
of
this
over
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
drinkability
hmm
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
my
definitive
pale
ale
and
i
think
it
will
retain
the
crown
i
like
dales
hoppiness
but
think
it
is
too
aggressive
i
think
dales
is
more
of
an
ipa
semantics
aside
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
o
a
solid
pale
ale
lots
of
hops
almost
at
an
ipa
level
pretty
refreshing
too
nothing
im
rushing
to
the
store
to
buy
again
but
its
a
quality
brew
while
not
my
top
rated
pale
ale
its
one
of
the
classic
solid
yearround
offerings
in
the
style
that
could
easily
be
stocked
up
on
the
hop
profile
is
actually
more
aggressive
than
expected
and
the
malty
sweetness
is
pretty
robust
for
what
it
is
it
lacks
consistency
in
the
body
and
aroma
but
it
is
undeniably
tasty
for
what
it
is
other
than
this
ive
only
had
ten
fidy
but
i
really
hope
i
can
find
more
spare
cans
from
the
brewery
because
im
definitely
interested
thus
far
in
moving
on
from
their
flagship
and
trying
other
brews
of
theirs
very
decent
citric
and
bitter
apa
the
taste
is
more
hop
forward
than
malt
forward
but
both
play
off
each
other
in
a
delightful
way
to
give
this
a
fine
balanced
ale
this
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
likable
and
its
in
a
can
so
you
can
take
it
to
the
beach
enjoy
one
today
overall
pretty
solid
and
favorite
apa
for
most
people
and
myself
for
many
years
i
will
be
enjoying
more
of
these
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
its
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
smooth
i
wouldnt
really
consider
this
a
pale
ale
by
no
means
its
darker
in
nature
and
it
tastes
and
behaves
like
an
ipa
style
beer
its
a
great
summer
beer
i
am
definitely
going
to
buy
this
one
again
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
regularly
for
close
to
three
years
now
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
served
cold
its
light
enough
to
be
relaxing
on
its
own
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
the
hops
really
come
out
making
it
a
nice
accompaniment
to
plenty
of
meals
spicy
asian
barbeque
or
texmex
taste
is
pleasantly
hopped
with
citrus
and
pine
notes
dominating
yet
without
any
element
of
bitterness
if
this
brew
is
anything
its
wellbalanced
delicious
sessionable
and
a
classic
beer
ill
seek
out
again
o
i
am
new
to
this
style
and
i
know
people
love
this
beer
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
you
get
the
hops
but
they
are
tainted
and
transformed
into
this
weird
taste
by
the
pale
part
of
it
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
but
it
just
tastes
like
a
bad
ipa
whose
hops
have
changed
their
flavor
i
know
it
isnt
an
ipa
but
that
is
what
it
reminds
me
of
overall
a
great
quaffable
ipa
considering
the
abv
really
could
be
sessionable
a
great
warm
weather
beer
poured
from
a
355ml
can
pours
a
bright
clear
orangish
gold
for
an
american
pale
ale
the
nose
is
surprisingly
muted
not
a
lot
going
on
though
it
may
have
been
a
little
on
the
cold
side
at
the
time
of
the
tasting
tempting
flavours
of
orange
tropical
fruits
and
malt
dominate
the
palate
this
is
a
nicely
complex
but
very
drinkable
beer
in
spite
of
the
highish
alcohol
o
not
a
ton
going
here
but
no

this
is
kind
of
a
benchmark
apa
in
a
lot
of
ways
except
that
its
more
like
ipa
strength
but
in
terms
of
feel
appearance
smell
and
taste
its
good
to
very
solid
in
every
respect
this
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
a
classic
craft
apa
for
years

oz
can
great
beachcampingpicnic
beer
o
this
was
the
first
offering
from
oskar
blues
i
have
tried
and
i
think
its
a
nice
pale
ale
this
style
kind
of
seems
a
bit
old
for
me
as
my
first
craft
brew
i
really
appreciated
was
summit
epa
and
this
is
very
comparable
to
epa
and
it
kind
of
brings
me
back
to
mn
drinking
summit
whenever
i
crave
summit
i
will
go
straight
to
dale
cheers
oone
of
the
better
apas
blurs
the
line
between
an
apa
and
an
ipa
as
the
can
says
one
voluminously
hopped
mutha
agreed
it
is
very
hopped
for
an
apa
but
it
would
be
a
great
summer
day
brew
the
dale
that
i
found
at
my
local
liquor
store
was
in
a
tall
boy
so
i
highly
recommend
you
seek
them
out
if
you
can
this
pale
ale
is
worth
it
a
great
all
around
brew
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
blurs
the
apaipa
line
o
wether
you
want
to
call
it
a
traditional
pale
ale
or
an
ipa
aside
this
is
just
a
damn
good
brew
nothing
else
really
needs
to
be
said
i
would
highly
recommend
it
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
will
definitely
be
revisiting
it
very
soon
cheers
the
beer
is
wonderfully
balanced
not
really
something
i
would
absolutely
consider
a
pale
ale
like
sierra
nevada
pale
or
southern
tier
live
because
it
lacks
that
refreshing
light
drinkability
however
instead
it
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
with
big
malt
backbone
pushing
towards
firestone
union
jack
quite
a
lovely
beer
overall
i
would
call
this
an
ipa
before
a
pale
ale
but
thats
just
me
great
beer
from
oskar
blues
never
dissapointed
i
would
reccomend
this
to
basically
any
craft
beer
drinker
as
hop
heads
will
enjoy
the
complex
hop
character
an
earthy
bitterness
combined
with
subtle
grapefruit
notes
i
prefer
it
out
of
the
can
as
i
do
with
most
oskar
blues
beers
o
you
know
you
have
something
pretty
good
on
your
hands
when
19
2
oz
seems
like
the
right
size
for
this
one
word
of
warning
though
this
one
might
be
too
bitter
for
newbs
teacolored
ale
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
retains
well
aromas
of
faint
citrus
and
sweet
bread
with
hints
of
berry
flavors
of
sweet
fruit
and
bread
with
a
slight
citrus
rind
tartness
has
a
really
complex
and
wellbalanced
profile
i
can
certainly
understand
all
the
hype
behind
this
brew
overall
drinkabiity
seems
like
this
is
a
cult
classic
so
i
was
glad
to
find
this
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
12oz
can
its
a
deep
golden
ale
topped
with
a
frothy
ivory
colored
head
holds
great
retention
and
leaves
thick
chunky
lacing
aromas
are
floral
hops
bready
malt
citric
caramel
a
bit
tropical
tastes
are
bready
caramel
pungent
grapefruit
and
pine
nice
mouthfeel
here
with
a
smooth
creaminess
while
being
medium
bodied
overall
solid
apa
and
holds
a
bit
of
nostalgia
for
me
as
i
highly
sought
after
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
before
it
was
available
in
il
the
appearance
was
an
ambergold
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
with
a
foamy
head
when
poured
the
smell
definitely
had
some
hops
to
it
and
smelled
of
citrus
with
a
touch
of
pine
the
taste
overall
was
ok
to
me
it
had
a
very
strong
hop
taste
so
it
was
a
little
overwhelming
to
me
reminds
me
a
lot
of
snpa
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
probably
give
this
a
slight
edge
over
that
taste
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
american
pale
ale
highly
drinkable
6
5
abv
is
well
hidden
very
delicious
beer
o
a
solid
beer
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
between
the
aggressive
hopping
and
the
intense
bready
malts
i
would
almost
say
that
they
overdid
it
if
they
really
want
to
call
this
a
pale
ale
definitely
a
big
beer
and
it
goes
down
easily
overall
a
decent
apa
goes
hard
on
the
side
of
malt
for
an
apa
but
is
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
canned
beer
flavors
are
a
straightforward
good
really
good
the
delicate
balance
of
hops
and
malt
backbone
are
nicely
achieved
and
the
citruspiney
characteristics
are
certainly
present
in
both
the
initial
flavors
and
the
aftertaste
dales
pale
ale
should
satisfy
apa
fans
that
appreciate
a
snappy
hop
presence
and
at
the
10
six
pack
price
point
it
is
a
solid
value
well
worthy
of
trying
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
beautiful
light
orange
color
with
a
good
fingerwidth
of
head
that
hangs
around
great
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
well
the
smell
is
very
gentle
just
a
hint
of
citrus
and
hops
taste
is
much
more
assertive
great
citrus
flavors
and
a
decent
hit
of
hops
really
nice
and
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
so
glad
michigan
has
this
now
this
is
the
first
can
of
this
i
have
ever
had
ive
had
samples
on
numerous
occasions
and
i
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
its
a
solid
apa
it
slowly
loses
some
of
its
charm
over
the
course
of
19
2
ounces
but
i
still
think
it
would
be
good
with
food
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
maybe
i
just
got
an
incredibly
fresh
batch
of
this
but
my
god
this
is
one
of
the
ten
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
drank
this
after
a
large
bottle
of
hennepin
another
personal
favorite
and
this
beer
blew
it
out
of
the
water
let
me
just
put
it
this
way
i
stopped
posting
on
ba
about
2
5
years
ago
because
i
just
kinda
got
bored
of
it
this
beer
inspired
me
to
come
back
and
post
a
review
between
this
and
the
alsoexceptional
fat
tire
shift
pale
lager
i
am
quickly
becoming
a
canned
beer
convert
if
you
see
it
try
it
o
very
solid
apa
that
i
could
drink
all
day
this
is
a
nice
one
to
keep
in
the
fridge
i
like
it
and
im
stoked
that
oskar
blues
has
entered
our
market
but
id
have
a
hard
time
buying
this
again
when
its
17
a
6er
im
grooving
on
it
but
id
take
red
racer
or
lagunitas
sucks
for
the
same
price
taste
was
better
than
aroma
led
me
to
believe
very
nice
body
with
slight
caramel
sweetness
but
not
too
much
and
not
in
the
finish
wish
i
could
get
in
indy
overall
again
i
love
oscar
blues
so
i
think
im
going
to
try
this
one
again
i
really
got
a
bit
of
a
different
flavor
profile
than
some
of
the
other
reviews
that
i
saw
on
here
it
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
other
pale
ales
i
enjoy
more
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
the
first
sip
is
almost
overbearing
because
it
shocked
me
with
all
the
citrus
flavor
after
that
i
knew
what
to
expect
and
it
was
really
good
although
not
a
session
beer
im
going
to
love
drinking
this
occasionally
overall
luckily
this
beer
is
so
readily
available
i
dismissed
it
as
average
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
after
having
it
on
tap
and
a
few
more
cans
it
has
become
a
top
tier
well
brewed
pale
ale
easy
choice
for
when
i
want
something
in
a
can
full
bodied
and
smooth
concealing
the
strength
and
kick
very
hoppy
so
very
hoppy
a
very
good
and
enjoyable
drink
for
really
kicking
back
year
round
cans
keep
it
cold
and
it
is
best
served
very
cold
red
ipas
seem
the
best
in
my
experience
and
this
one
embodies
that
rule
love
it
o
this
is
one
of
the
more
tasty
pale
ales
ive
had
in
awhile
nice
bready
malt
character
with
a
decent
hop
profile
o
very
wellrounded
brew
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
great
and
feels
great
going
down
a
must
try
especially
for
fans
of
apas
nice
beer
strong
hoppy
finish
this
stuff
is
way
too
easy
to
drink
even
though
it
could
have
been
served
a
smidgeon
colder
my
mistake
very
good
o
this
is
a
really
solid
pale
as
opposed
to
other
pales
that
are
bland
and
unremarkable
this
one
has
character
great
malt
profile
bolder
that
normal
hops
somewhat
slick
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
if
this
was
readily
available
to
me
i
think
it
would
be
my
go
to
session
brew
overall
comes
across
as
a
more
oily
and
bitter
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
many
claim
this
is
more
like
an
ipa
but
despite
the
bitterness
the
more
grainy
and
sweet
malts
keep
this
in
pale
ale
territory
o
perhaps
the
most
ubiquitous
canned
craft
brew
and
for
good
reason
its
crispness
and
citrusy
hop
bite
make
it
a
refreshing
quaff
that
hits
the
spot
especially
well
in
those
bbqoutdoor
roles
not
the
deepest
apa
and
a
bit
aggressive
but
in
the
end
thats
what
makes
this
beer
work
this
beer
is
light
and
crisp
but
still
hoppy
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
this
beer
has
been
around
for
what
seems
like
forever
now
but
its
stood
the
test
of
time
oskar
blues
is
the
original
canned
craft
beer
at
first
it
seemed
like
that
they
were
just
a
novelty
beer
beer
that
doesnt
suck
in
a
can

it
wasnt
that
smooth
because
it
was
a
little
overly
bitter
but
with
a
couple
adjustments
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
session
pale
ale
this
made
for
a
nice

impression

quite

a

im
starting

like
the

at

it

reminds

not

definitely
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
carbonation
is
lacking
i
could
see
myself
bringing
this
on
camping
trips
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
new
canned
sierra
nevada
torpedos
certainly
not
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
i
judge
on
style
and
this
isnt
close
to
being
a
pale
ale
its
an
ipa
and
would
get
higher
marks
from
me
if
it
were
called
one
nice
bitter
hoppy
ipa
though
if
someone
else
buys
i
might
try
a
third
but
id
prefer
an
adjunct
lager
over
this
slosh
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
just
not
a
pale

to
me
to
big
on
the

flavor
biscuity
piney
citrusy
aromas
spring
out
of
this
deep
gold
pale
ale
for
a
pale
ale
its
pretty
darn
hoppy
and
coats
the
mouth
a
little
bit
the
full
body
and
medium
low
carbonation
make
give
it
a
rich
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
this
is
hop
forward
but
smooth
with
just
enough
malt
behind
it
pretty
good
although
more
of
an
ipa
to
me
than
a
pale
ale
tasty
mouthfeel
is
good
light
body
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
and
a
good
amount
of
hop
resin
definitely
a
good
pale
ale
its
not
alpha
king
but
a
good
one
to
drink
great
pale
ale
to
take
outdoors
indoors
school
work
wherever
will
definitely
grab
some
again

this

despite

savor
this
one
as
the
lingering

keep
you

of
this

one
of
which
i
will
have
again
and
again
overall
beer
in

i
love
this
stuff
my
favorite
pale

some
might
say
the
hops

hefty

the
malt
and
yeast
arent
slouches
either
i

offsets

overall
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
at
times
i
taste
strange
malty
notes
in
there
that
remind
me
vaguely
of
old
chub
which
i
dont
like
very
much
and
it
kind
of
bother
me
but
usually
i
just
taste
great
clean
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
oseems
to
be
just
a
little
bit
light
on
the
flavor
i
remember
having
this
one
a
few
years
ago
and
thinking
it
was
better
perhaps
just
a
bad
batch
addendum
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
this
beer
advertises
itself
as
voluminously
hopped
and
yet
it
wasnt
extremely
hoppy
i
checked
the
bottom
of
the
can
and
sure
enough
the
one
i
got
was
about
8
months
old
which
makes
me
wonder
if
id
like
it
less
if
it
were
fresh
im
really
not
a
hophead
so
probably
going
to
have
to
find
a
fresher
can
and
give
it
a
whirl
a
refreshing
pale
ale
the
hops
and
alcohol
make
it
hard
to
imagine
drinking
a
too
many
of
these
but
it
is
still
a
tasty
beer
the
hop
aftertaste
is
very
pleasant
a
truly
great
beer
without
excess
how
often
do
you
find
that
if
you
see
someone
drinking
this
after
an
afternoon
working
outside
you
know
they
know
good
beer
so
good
i
want
another
pours
of
clear
dark
orange
with
a
white
head
goos
amount
of
lacing
and
carbonation
aroma
of
malty
sweetness
and
minimal
citrus
hops
is
also
present
taste
is
strong
caramel
malt
with
well
balanced
light
hop
finish
less
bitter
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
ive
had
pales
i
prefer
to
this
however
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
cans
but
to
me
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
the
bitter
american
i
had
earlier
tonight
o
this
was
good
but
not
great
i
guess
its
cool
that
its
in
a
can
makes
for
a
great
golf
buddy
o
i
can
see
why
this
has
such
a
strong
reputation
but
overall
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
o
id
agree
with
others
that
i
seems
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
but
either
way
it
is
awesome
and
a
great
beer
for
most
any
occassion
o
id
consider
this
a
well
balanced
ipa
rather
than
a
hopped
pale
ale
but
whatever
its
a
good
beer
one
of
the
better
flagshipeveryday
beers
out
there
a
bit
pricey
in
mass
for
what
it
is
but
a
good
beer
highly
recommended
not
bad
but
if
i
had
a
choice
i
would
drink
something
else
o
color
me
impressed
im
not
really
a
hops
guy
but
can
wade
in
out
to
pale
ale
depth
this
one
is
surprisingly
nice
i
love
the
way
the
hops
pop
in
to
say
hi
and
then
dart
out
its
neat
because
its
not
just
a
taste
its
a
little
event
i
love
when
a
beer
does
something
active
like
that
it
puts
it
on
my
memorably
interesting
list
with
a
little
more
malt
character
id
be
totally
onboard
ov
honestly
how
is
this
not
an
ipa
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
character
and
body
the
bitter
hops
will
delight
and
you
will
drink
any
and
all
i
place
in
front
of
you
enjoy
each
one
as
it
is
poured
cheers
o
an
impressive
balanced
pale

extremely
drinkable

i
only
wish
i
had
a
few
more
on
hand
overall
love
it
great
session
beer
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
but
could
use
a
bit
more
fizz
the
body
is
spot
on
for
the
style
but
the
carbonation
could
use
a
bit
of
work
the
swallow
is
rather
weak
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
ipa
while
not
having
read
up
on
the
beer
prior
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
much
more
mild
hop
flavor
and
something
on
the
sweeter
ale
side
so
when
i
got
my
first
experience
of
the
smell
and
taste
it
really
struck
me
off
guard
but
in
a
very
good
way
its
a
good
brew
to
go
for
m
light
body
moderate
carbonation
medium
bodied
its
definitely
a
creamy
beer
the
carbonation
feels
a
little
weak
and
only
bites
the
tongue
when
you
hold
onto
your
sip
for
a
few
extra
seconds
but
its
present
enough
to
maintain
continuity
beer
coats
the
tongue
well
and
finishes
dry
hazy

a
fluffy
creamy
beige
head
subtle
aroma
of
creamy
caramelly
and
grainy
malt

mild

zest
and
grapefruit
hop
oils
the
caramel
grain
breadiness
and
and
light
cookie
elements
tend
to
be
a
bit
more
dominate
the
body
is
relatively
moderate
a
little
light
and
easy
drinking
with
molderate
to
active
carbonation
the
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
mild

im

what
a

might
taste
like
in

this
is
in

o
an

in

for
tailgaiting

whatever
its

othis
is

had
this

and
the
quality

overall
a
pretty

this

not

i
have

that
just
did

as

very
great
beer
by
these
guys
and
i
will
never
say
no
to
this
one
if
its
not
the
best
canned

in

which
one
is

i
rate
it

with
a
finish
of
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
if
you
like
a
hoppy
kick
to
your
drinking
experience
overall
an
excellent
pale
ale
which
gives
a
good
accounting
of
itself
and
is
balanced
without
becoming
too
hop
forward
overall
well
put
together
beer
but
just
right
when
you
drink
it
sometimes
i
feel
like
just
inhaling
the
glass
not
you
starter
beer
if
you
just
started
drinking
but
definitely
your
keeper
to
keep
an
above
average
beer
in
your
fridge
for
the
right
price
salud
overall
impression
a
very
hoppy
brew
but
can
tell
the
malts
had
a
part
in
here
too
at
first
i
didnt
realize
this
was
from
oskar
blues
but
what
would
you
know
another
great
brew
i
also
thought
it
was
only
a
pale
ale
and
so
had
a
higher
rating
in
the
back
of
my
head
but
now
that
i
know
the
truth
well
its
still
awesome
recommend
o
a
good
pale
ale
not
the
best
one
out
there
but
it
gets
the
job
done
and
compares
pretty
well
to
most
a
very
good
pale
ale
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
a
solid
drinker
overall
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
think
its
a
little
bit
over
priced
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
my
gold
standard
of
daisy
cutter
crystal
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
lingers
has
that
traditional
apa
blast
of
crispy
citrus
hops
spicy
bitter
flavor
with
a
medium
sour
finish
which
lingers
a
little
longer
than
id
like
i
can
sense
a
mild
maltiness
in
the
beginning
not
as
refreshing
as
others
id
had
of
this
style
the
sour
taste
does
fade
after
awhile
to
make
it
more
enjoyable
overall
a
really
nice
standard
ipa
and
well
worth
the
visit
o
i
enjoy
this
well
worth
the
9
for
a
6
pack
when
fresh
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
went
through
two
in
an
hour
be
careful
though
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
o
i
feel
i
tried
dales
pale
too
late
in
my
beer
experiences
although
it
is
hop
forward
which
i
love
in
a
session
pale
ale
it
is
not
the
combination
of
hops
that
are
my
favorite
still
an
epic
classic
that
people
love
o
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
perhaps
too
hoppy
for
some
as
an
apa
but
this
is
always
my
first
choice
for
a
summer
bbq
beer
bright
and
hoppy
but
not
too
aggressive
also
the
can
rocks
keep
it
up
ob
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
ever
consumed
drinkable
enjoyable
and
likely
to
find
wide
appeal
recommended
will
definitely
drink
again
oskar
blues
flagship
brew
now
widely
proliferated
this
beer
pours
a
thick
amber
honey
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
lasts
smells
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
but
has
a
defined
malt
strength
that
i
guess
qualifies
it
taste
is
quite
hoppy
too
crisp
and
satisfying
has
a
pine
and
cut
grass
earthiness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
smooth
but
the
heavier
body
can
be
filling
this
is
a
versatile
beer
and
a
good
every
day
drinker
but
i
find
it
works
particularly
well
with
spicy
foods
of
the
southwest
smooth
pour
richer
color
tone
than
expected
reddish
gold
lasting
white
fluffy
head
with
lacing
moderately
hoppy
and
citrusy
scent
nice
hoppy
taste
well
balanced
and
extremely
crispy
with
light
to
medium
body
and
good
bitterness
lingering
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
especially
for
the
price
and
the
classic
can
look
o
perfect
session
beer
always
great
to
grab
in
a
pinch
my
favorite
beer
in
a
can
a
tremendous

and
drinking

at

abv
this
one
is
a
great
session
brew
that
makes
it
a
standout
apa
great
stuff
here
nabbed
a
can
in
jfk
waiting
for
a
flight
brew
had
a
soft
almost
chestnut
orange
look
with
a
thin
frothy
white
head
lacing
looked
sticky
smelled
of
subtle
pale
ale
with
a
kick
of
wheat
and
orange
peel
easy
drinker
with
a
really
nice
hop
presence
medium
feel
with
a
subtle
bitter
ending
one
of
the
ultimates
when
it
comes
to
pale
ales
dr
drinkable
and
pleasant
but
far
from
exemplary
o
what
can
i
say
been
drinking
this
for
a
few
years
will
continue
to
do
so
great
beer
to
help
introduce
folks
to
ipas
from
a
great
brewery
to
introduce
folks
into
craft
beer
in
general
o
its
been
at
least
two
years
since
i
tried
this
one
and
it
was
about
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
cheers
o
overall
nothing
crazy
pretty
simple
flavors
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
super
drinkablerefreshing
not
a
beer
i
would
wow
anyone
with
but
a
solid
session
ipa
see
why
hop
heads
like
this
so
much
sorry
to
say
i
didnt
drink
not
on
par
with
snpa
or
some
of
the
other
classics
still
a
good
canned
option
for
those
in
need
in
a
pinch
or
for
the
right
event
i
am
reaching
for
dales
o
wow
perfectly
fine
beer
if
they
didnt
say
apa
it
would
be
an
ipa
for
me
watch
out
these
will
sneak
up
on
you
so
good
its
easy
to
have
three
or
four
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
strong
enough
hops
to
keep
a
hophead
like
me
content
but
not
overly
so
where
youre
questioning
whether
or
not
it
should
be
classified
an
ipa
overall
my
wifes
uncle
offered
me
this
beer
3
years
ago
after
the
first
sip
i
said
wow
where
did
you
get
this
at
since
then
ive
been
picking
up
a
case
of
dales
more
often
than
any
other
craft
beer
not
only
is
this
a
great
tasting
ipa
it
comes
in
cans
and
is
priced
right
which
makes
it
a
great
value
o
this
is
very
refreshing
and
it
is
well
balanced
nothing
is
over
the
top
very
easy
to
drink
even
if
it
lacks
a
great
pale
ale
flavorful
kick
underrated
beer
well
balanced
slightly
sweet
but
dry
just
the
right
carbonation
very
well
done
all
around
maybe
theyre
onto
somthing
with
the
can
as
well
torn
between
4
0
and
4
5
overall
id
call
it
an
ipa
but
a
good
standard
beer
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
deep
vibrant
yellowcopper
coloring
with
a
one
inch
thick
frothy
foamy
head
that
settles
quickly
into
a
film
covering
that
also
coats
the
glass
fairly
well
good
heavy
nose
of
hops
with
a
resiny
and
tangy
character
and
some
light
citrus
and
malt
blending
flavors
are
hop
forward
with
a
peppery
and
basil
spicing
which
is
balanced
by
a
buttery
and
toffeelike
malt
as
well
as
a
slight
citrus
highlight
very
well
blended
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
sweet
and
resiny
hops
bitterness
with
a
slight
cloying
effect
to
it
slick
somewhat
lingering
finish
with
a
slow
steady
withdrawal
that
dries
evenly
and
subtly
good
solid
brew

overall
get
a
case
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
expected
this
is
a
nice
and
fairly
refreshing
ipa
nothing
earthshattering
but
certainly
pleasant
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
really
nice
and
full
flavoured
pale
ale
nice
taste
in
both
the
malts
and
hops
the
dales
pale
ale
pours
amber
looking
haze
with
a
small
head
not
much
carbonation
which
is
pretty
normal
for
the
style
not
much
in
the
way
of
nose
even
as
it
warms
up
it
tastes
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
than
an
american
not
much
in
the
way
of
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
goes
down
easy
middle
of
the
road
pale
for
me
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
hefty
head
that
lingers
o
i
like
where
this
beer
is
coming
from
but
the
execution
is
just
a
hair
off
pretty
damn
tasty
still
great
example
of
drinkable
canned
craft
pours
a
golden
honey
color
with
a
two
finger
head
and
great
lacing
aroma
of
crazy
hops
citrus
and
pine
all
up
in
my
grill
in
the
best
way
possible
taste
follows
the
nose
this
is
a
great
tasty
easy
drinking
canned
beer
i
love
it
i
buy
it
by
the
case
transparent
honeyamber
with
eggshell
colored
craggy
two
finger
head
minor
lacing
only
nice
carbonation
creamy
texture
intense
toffee
malt
scent
combined
with
piney
resin
pitch
and
citrus
oils
on
tasting
i
am
surprised
this
is
called
an
apa
by
my
tastebuds
this
brew
sits
smack
on
the
borderline
between
my
definition
of
an
apa
and
ipa
in
bittering
taste
follows
the
nose
but
also
includes
a
modicum
of
simcoe
onionyness
that
i
didnt
smell
in
the
nose
not
a
deadly
large
amount
mind
you
but
just
the
right
amount
in
a
sane
dose
that
stays
delicious
really
delicious
and
full
of
bold
flavor
in
both
malts
and
hops
i
only
ever
revisit
about
25
of
the
brews
that
i
try
for
the
first
time
and
i
am
pretty
sure
that
this
one
will
be
getting
a
repeat
visit
in
the
future
so
take
that
as
a
recommendation
i
just
wish
more
of
that
flavor
was
represented
in
the
nose
if
i
were
to
nitpick
it
d
this
beer
really
delivers
in
terms
of
flavor
the
can
might
make
it
good
to
introduce
good
beers
to
skeptics
oskar
blues
hasnt
failed
to
impress
me
yet
overallvery
hoppy
pale
ale
almost
an
ipa
pretty
good
but
have
had
better
pale
ales
that
are
easy
to
get
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
pale
ale
and
a
great
session
beer
its
a
solid
apa
typical
of
the
style
not
better
and
not
worse
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
if
its
the
best
choice
at
the
time
edit
having
another
one
of
these
tonight
straight
from
the
can
something
about
the
can
helps
this
beer
out
maybe
its
the
suprise
factor
or
its
still
familiar
i
like
it
better
from
the
can
rather
than
the
pouring
but
still
agree
with
the
rest
well
even
for
a
guy
who
doesnt
like
pale
ales
this
was
good
it
did
seem
a
bit
more
bitter
than
standard
pale
ales
and
ive
heard
a
troubled
classification
of
this
beer
but
judging
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
good
easily
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
the
style
very
solid
balanced
apa
probably
my
favorite
apa
that
ive
had
to
date
poured
from
a
can
into
a
snifter
grassy
sweet
aroma
golden
apearance
slight
head
that
remains
to
thinly
lace
the
top
head
is
eggshell
to
tan
taste
is
that
of
citrus
hops
and
slightly
fruity
palate
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
better
on
tap
or
straight
from
the
can
o
a
very
nice
pale
ale
with
a
great
deal
of
flavor
this
brewery
is
helping
me
overcome
my
selfimposed
longstanding
prejudice
against
canned
beers
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
again
o
a
canned
staple
love
this
beer
and
commonly
keep
it
stocked
in
the
fridge
o
very
drinkable
i
like
the
crispness
and
hop
that
this
pale
brings
poured

pours
a
orange
red
with
a
1
inch
sticky
white
head
tons
of
lacing
smell
pine
orange
and
grass
taste
all
of
that
maybe
a
little
bolder
then
the
nose
very
refreshing
but
large
body
for
the
style
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
going
i
would
drink
this
summer
fall
winter
or
spring
the
deep
orange
color
is
darker
than
i
would
have
expected
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
complex
with
a
combination
of
caramel
sweetness
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
much
more
onedimensional
with
strong
notes
of
pine
and
grapefruit
making
the
flavor
bigger
and
bitterer
than
many
pale
ales
the
bitterness
builds
which
can
make
it
tough
to
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
overall
flavorful
and
a
great
option
among
canned
beers
overall
a
very
nice
apa
almost
sessionable
but
a
little
high
in
alcohol
to
have
more
than
two
or
three
at
a
sitting
bitterness
isnt
palate
fatiguing
a
freshing
beer
for
6
5
percent
and
a
firm
bitterness
for
my
records
can
purchased
in
mix
6
at
plw
unknown
price
overall
i
expected
more
from
what
everyone
told
me
about
this
beer
still
a
good
beer
to
drink
though
seemed
like
an
ipa
and
pale
ale
mix
to
me
cheers
skål
o
awesome
beer
loved
drinking
everyone
of
them
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
lately
super
refreshing
and
almost
crossing
the
line
into
ipa
territory
keeps
me
wanting
more
o
love
this
beer
this
particular
batch
seemed
more
hop
forward
and
less
balanced
than
i
remember
apa
is
my
favorite
type
of
beer
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
go
if
youve
never
had
one
this
might
be
the
most
enjoyable
beer
ive
had
all
summer
pours
a
mild
pale
gold
not
a
huge
head
but
its
there
scent
is
not
huge
but
smell
some
light
citrus
and
pine
resins
taste
is
mild
slightly
sweet
citrus
and
bitter
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
dry
overall
really
nice
apa
o
the
complete
product
is
more
than
its
sums
why
well
its
a
really
good
and
pleasurable
apa
that
balances
very
well
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
the
volumeintensity
in
each
category
is
moderate
but
never
light
or
weak
from
this
standpoint
its
a
terrific
american
pale
ale
overall
drinkability
the
more
i
have
this
beer
the
more
i
like
it
i
could
have
several
of
these
but
since
i
had
to
get
back
to
work
later
and
they
were
7
each
at
this
restaurant
i
thought
i
should
abstain
so
very
drinkable
and
it
pairs
well
with
food
overall
this
is
just
a
finely
balanced
smooth
and
flavorful
apa
especially
if
you
like
hops
and
i
would
think
that
even
if
you
didnt
you
may
still
like
it
very
good
and
i
can
only
hope
someday
6
packs
of
it
show
up
in
my
part
of
oh
d
a
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
good
hops
and
nice
sweetness
combine
to
make
this
a
very
tasty
brew
overall
an
awesome
pale
ale
so
so
good
the
taste
was
all
right
it
was
hoppy
but
theres
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
unique
about
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
just
fine
i
just
realized
that
this
is
probably
not
suited
for
tubing
but
maybe
around
campfire
if
you
want
to
really
take
your
time
drinking
a
pale
ale
very
amber
in
color
the
foamy
offwhite
head
was
comprised
of
mediumlarge
bubbles
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
and
floral
with
a
bit
of
plum
the
taste
is
hoppy
malty
and
resiny
with
a
tad
of
citrus
and
caramel
the
beer
is
fairly
balanced
but
might
be
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
bitter
but
satisfying
the
beer
seems
to
almost
border
on
an
american
amber
the
packaging
was
deceiving
i
would
encourage
oskar
blues
to
hire
a
marketing
company
a
little
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
but
damn
delicious
and
in
a
can
its
perfect
for
the
pool
or
tailgate
great
beer
great
hop
and
malt
character
well
balanced
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
oskar
blues
and
dales
is
one
of
my
favorites
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
drink
would
make
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
nice
creamy
feel
and
good
apa
hop
flavor
highly
recommended
to
others
pours
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
faint
malt
aromas
quickly
usurped
by
the
hop
bouquet
the
hops
are
fragrant
and
come
close
to
a
ipa
for
hoppiness
the
taste
definitely
does
not
disappoint
smooth
malty
sweetness
perfectly
balanced
by
the
bittering
hops
hop
flavor
is
evident
as
well
medium

with
a
very
smooth

clean
really
well
done
a
good
pale
ale
though
admittedly
a
little
disappointing
after
falling
head
over
heels
in
love
with
oskar
blues
ten
fidy
definitely
a
favorite
beer
and
it
comes
in
a
can
too
o
dales
pale
ale
is
easy
to
recommend
for
no
glass
situations
when
one
needs
canned
beer
and
wants
one
that
is
hoppy
o
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
it
is
indeed
a
voluminously
hopped
motha
of
an
apa
not
quite
an
ipa
it
is
less
bitter
while
still
very
flavorful
with
hops
this
is
a
pale
ale
that
beer
lovers
can
adore
but
that
wont
scare
off
newcomers
as
much
as
an
ipa
might
delicious
and
refreshing
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
poured
a
nice
rich
attractive
amber
color
with
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
nice
hoppy
aroma
this
was
a
very
nicely
balance
pale
ale
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
were
perfect
this
was
easy
drinking
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
in
a
sitting
i
think
i
have
a
new
favorite
pale
ale
had
this
yesterday
at
the
idle
rich
pub
here
in
dallas
and
its
pretty
much
the
draft
version
only
as
a
cask
again
it
is
pa
defined
serveed
with
a
creamy
thick
medium
sized
head
that
just
sat
there
lots
of
lace
great
mouth
feel
chewy
hops
that
are
perfectly
matched
to
the
malt
and
carbonation
style
exceedingly
well
balanced
did
notice
a
hint
of
butterscotch
in
there
but
it
was
fleeting
nice
easy
finish
dales
pale
is
hoppy
but
balanced
theres
a
hop
bite
to
this
beer
complemented
by
a
malt
backbone
full
bodied
and
slightly
chewy
not
sure
how
well
it
hews
to
the
style
as
i
think
of
my
pale
ales
as
being
more
crisp
and
floral
but
im
not
complaining
this
american
pale
ale
is
so
balanced
that
is
only
the
word
to
describe
this
beer
goes
down
easy
with
a
clean
finish
it
is
really
a
no
brainier
if
you
are
looking
for
an
apa
for
any
occasion
then
look
no
further
and
the
best
part
is
it
is
in
a
can
love
it
did
i
mention
it
was
balanced
haha
pick
a
six
pack
up
if
you
see
ever
see
it
sharp
effervescence
up
front
with
a
dry
finish
medium
body
and
a
somewhat
full
carbonation
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
this
brew
is
really
an
ipa
and
not
a
pale
ale
higher
marks
if
labeled
as
such
overall
a
very
good
beer
definitely
need
to
try
if
you
like
pale
ale
or
ipa
on
the
soft
side
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
great
beer
and
love
picking
this
up
when
i
visit
my
brother
if
i
could
get
this
beer
more
easily
this
one
would
always
be
in
my
fridge
really
enjoy
this
apa
and
it
taste
great
overall
this
would
be
a
good
pale
and
one
i
would
keep
in
the
fridge
if
it
was
a
little
less
expensive
i
will
stick
with
lagunitas
new
dogtown
pale
instead

ending
with
a
good

for

whoa
for
minute
there
a
i
thought
was
drinking
an
ipa
seems
a
bit
dark
and
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
but
overall
a
fairly
good
drinkable
brew
o
not
really
an
american
pale
ale
but
a
great
ipa
i
guess
that
this
ones
become
a
minor
classic
over
the
last
several
years
and
theres
a
reason
why
its
a
well
made
apa
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
the
craft
beer
lovers
happy
but
still
approachable
enough
to
bring
new
drinkers
in
as
well
and
its
in
a
can
this
is
solid
stuff
here
that
i
would
never
turn
down
as
a
gateway
beer
this
beer
probably
does
very
well
while
the
qualities
of
this
beer
are
not
what
i
typically
care
for
in
an
apa
i
can
not
deny
that
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
that
is
so
well
executed
for
what
it
is
that
i
cant
help
but
score
it
higher
than
i
normally
would
recommended
especially
if
fresh
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
can
unfortunately
my
cans
about
2
months
old
the
color
is
a
nearly
clear
copper
the
head
drops
fast
but
leaves
lacing
all
around
the
glass
not
much
hop
aroma
coming
at
me
smells
sweet
tastes
sweet
as
well
but
not
in
a
bad
way
theres
a
little
bit
of
pineynessresin
going
on
to
balance
out
the
malt
and
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
but
even
at
2
months
olds
this
is
very
good
i
could
drink
these
all
day
one
of
the
best
session
beers
around
and
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
odales
pale
ale
was
not
a
bad
beer
my
sample
could
have
been
younger
but
overall
the
beer
was
a
flavorful
session
pale
ale
that
had
a
sweet
front
that
was
backed
by
a
solid
but
balanced
bitterness
o
quite
possibly
the
best
apa
ive
had
to
date
overall
while
i
find
the
beers
slogan
rather
overblown
the
beer
itself
is
quite
good
and
just
might
change
your
mind
about
beer
in
cans
o
6
packs
12
packs
it
doesnt
matter
its
a
beer
that
easily
stocks
ones
fridge
an
every
day
can
that
should
be
in
your
fridge
perfect
for
fishing
watching
tv
grilling
or
hangin
with
the
friends
its
a
beer
that
fits
in
your
hand
well
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
with
the
taste
complexity
of
a
sipping
beer
and
a
lack
of
heaviness
so
that
you
could
have
more
than
one
excellent
deliciousness
kudos
to
oskar
blues
for
making
such
an
enjoyable
hoppy
brew
in
such
a
dads
beerlooking
can
pound
for
pound
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
consumed
in
terms
of
sheer
drinkability
and
cost
my
wife
and
i
enjoyed
this
so
much
we
picked
up
two
extra
six
packs
to
replace
the
first
sixer
we
demolished
in
the
hotel
great
brew
final
thoughts
this
is
a
nice
ipa
if
only
it
was
an
ipa
this
is
too
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
i
am
well
aware
that
apas
are
more
hop
forward
this
is
over
done
imo
i
love
pas
but
this
one
is
really
just
like
a
light
bodied
ipa
ive
had
ipas
that
were
much
less
hoppy
also
the
body
is
too
light
for
a
pa
close
to
watery
not
happy
with
this
one
as
a
apa
great
looks
good
nose
but
it
stops
there
for
me
if
they
want
to
remarket
it
as
a
ipa
and
fixed
the
body
id
buy
it
again
the
color
was
a
nice
copperish
color
with
a
white
head
which
left
good
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
with
every
sip
the
smell
was
mostly
of
hops
with
a
little
caramel
malts
in
the
back
the
feel
was
medium
to
light
with
lots
of
hop
resin
coating
the
taste
was
great
even
better
than
i
remember
and
i
remember
it
being
good
you
get
a
little
caramel
malts
up
front
but
a
load
of
bitter
pine
hops
on
the
way
down
and
a
nice
hoppy
lingering
after
taste
this
stuff
is
excellent
i
actually
prefer
this
over
both
of
their
actual
official
ipas
heck
it
might
even
be
my
favorite
oskar
product
excellent
beer
enjoy
has
a
huge
hop
character
once
poured
from
the
can
and
has
a
wonderful
pine
hop
aroma
very
drinkable
and
much
less
carbonated
that
i
was
expecting
but
it
didnt
take
away
from
the
beer
at
all
i
would
be
quick
to
move
this
to
the
ipa
category
but
it
also
a
very
solid
pale
ale
as
well
it
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
small
white
head
light
and
fruity
hop
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
coming
through
though
not
overly
sweet
the
hoppiness
is
readily
apparent
but
not
overtly
bitter
and
perfectly
in
balance
with
the
malt
ive
heard
this
considered
as
more
of
an
ipa
though
im
not
getting
that
the
malt
backbone
is
typical
for
the
style
with
just
a
touch
more
hops
than
most
other
apas
nice
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
for
the
style
as
well
overall
this
is
a
great
rendition
of
the
american
ipa
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
apa
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
possibly
sessionable
most
apas
i
could
not
drink
more
than
1
and
then
the
final
14th
is
forced
down
nicely
crafted
and
a
good
example
of
an
apa
to
export
to
rest
of
world
to
see
what
were
doing
well
here
in
the
us
of
a
overall
really
good
pale
ale
maybe
my
favorite
pale
ale
a
must
try
overall
a
wonderfully
creative
and
fullflavored
american
beer
good
beer
but
dales
pale
has
too
heavy
of
a
mouthfeel
for
it
to
be
a
pale
while
it
is
a
bit
too
malt
forward
for
me
to
consider
it
an
ipa
style
classification
issues
aside
i
really
do
like
this
beer
because
of
its
wellbalanced
character
and
its
earthy
flavors
i
also
love
the
fact
that
it
is
in
a
can
because
this
is
a
great
camping
beer
can
that
be
the
name
of
its
style
o
i
love
the
fact
that
there
is
a
good
pale
ale
i
can
get
that
comes
in
a
can
a
great
tailgating
beer
no
longer
are
you
stuck
drinking
monotonous
macro
canned
beer
typically
found
at
most
tailgates
and
summer
parties
thank
you
oskar
blues
where
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
the
most
is
on
a
hot
hot
day
sitting
around
a
fire
cooking
foord
and
throwing
a
frisbee
o
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
the
juicy
hop
combo
is
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
unreal
o
very
sessionable
good
flavor
good
balance
nice
feel
pretty
damn
drinkable
definitely
pioneering
the
can
revolution
serving
type
can
overall
this
was
enjoyable
although
i
prefer
a
couple
of
local
favorites
alpha
king
and
daisy
cutter
this
beer
hits
all
the
right
notes
when
it
comes
to
apaipa
taste
there
is
robust
hop
flavor
almost
imperceptibly
but
finely
balanced
by
a
slight
caramel
of
the
malts
it
has
a
fantastic
hop
aftertaste
with
a
great
spectrum
of
flavors
lingering
on
the
palate
big
flavor
onslaught
and
nice
complexity
make
this
a
standout
as
im
sure
others
would
say
its
quite
similar
to
sierra
nevada
pa
but
with
a
bit
more
hoppiness
that
makes
for
an
outstanding
beer
poured
from
a
can
into
a
dales
pale
ale
pint
glass
picked
up
from
the
brewery
amberorange
color
with
2fb
of
white
head
that
dissipates
with
some
lacing
floral
scent
malty
with
piney
hop
flavors
with
residual
bitterness
this
has
been
my
go
to
pale
ale
for
the
last
year
and
have
tried
others
available
in
my
area
but
still
coming
back
o
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
but
not
sure
id
seek
this
out
year
round
this
beer
is
really
impressive
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
sturdy
looking
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
really
good
too
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
really
good
hop
quality
to
it
there
is
a
little
malt
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
also
this
beer
could
almost
be
an
ipa
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
dry
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
was
expective
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
but
i
was
happy
that
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
did
very
enjoyable
brew
othe
can
is
a
great
vessel
for
this
beer
it
is
fresh
hop
filled
and
balanced
excelent
beer
a
very
nice
beer
it
has
what
i
like
in
a
pale
ale
color
strong
aromas
and
good
hop
bitterness
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
it
was
only
available
in
my
area
good
solid
well
hopped
american
pale
in
a
can
the
can
version
has
more
carbonation
as
you
can
pour
more
as
you
like
seems
to
be
more
of
an
ipa
with
the
seriously
resiny
taste
sharp
an
increasingly
harsh
bitterness
but
if
thats
your
style
this
is
fullbodied
and
straightforward
edit
had
a
lot
of
these
since
my
initial
review
yes
it
really
is
an
ipa
still
very
balanced
definitely
hoppy
but
not
an
overwhelming
bitter
bomb
easy
drinking
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
minimal
sweetness
just
good
clean
drinkin
fun
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
oskar
blues
also
loving
the
can
this
may
just
become
my
new
goto
beer
for
future
summer
outings
d
not
bad
at
all
good
example
of
an
apa
and
kudos
to
ob
for
keeping
it
canned
ooverall
this
a
solid
apa
easy
drinking
and
i
really
love
the
portability
of
the
cans
its
not
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
its
pretty
damn
good
despite
the
beers
lingering
bitterness
this
beer
is
made
with
quality
and
dignity
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
unintentionally
patriotic
beers
with
a
red
blue
white
and
silver
can
so
its
probably
quite
appropriate
at
any
memorial
day
4th
of
july
party
i
think
the
price
is
key
to
buying
this
beer
a
second
time
and
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
friends
and
family
pours

hazy
amber
color

fingers
of
cream
colored

sits
briefly
the
nose
is
faint
and
has
a
bit
of
hops
and
yeast
to
it
but
not
much
more
thankfully
the
taste
is
much
different
a
tasty
balance
of
bitter
citrus
pine
and
malt
ensues
a
nice
honey
taste
is
offered
with
the
malt
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
that
os
crisp
overall
damn
good
pale
ale
and
glad
i
have
more
to
drink
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
white

fresh

aroma
taste
is
an
aggressive
bitter
piney
hop
flavor
up
front
that
transitions
to
a
malt
accented
finish
some
tingly
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
borders
on
an
ipa
but
i
love
it
what
a
great
pale
ale
pours
clear
orangeycopper
aroma
is
fruity
with
hops
standing
out
moderate
to
high
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
nice
hop
vs

balance
easy
drinking
and
great
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
favorited
american
pale
ales
that
is
always
stocked
in
my
fridge
and
i
am
very
discriminating
when
it
comes
to
fridge
space
i
love
cans
dales
pale
ale
going
to
give
this
one
the
shortcut
of
reviews
looks
amazing
smells
decent
tastes
is
so
good
so
good
so
good
great
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
beer
is
really
good
always
available
always
good
its
pretty
badass
that
it
comes
in
a
can
too
will
definitely
be
getting
more
had
plenty
of
dales
before
but
never
like
this
felt
like
a
real
treat
really
dug
it
overall
great
beer
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
o
well
worth
a
try
here
has
some
great
refreshing
taste
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
can
see
this
in
a
cooler
at
the
beach
or
on
a
boat
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
out
there
add
that
its
in
a
can
only
makes
it
more
appealing
can
pours
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
large
long
lasting
foamy
white
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
piney
hops
and
biscuit
malt
medium
smooth
body
citrus
fruit
piney
hops
dominate
the
palate
with
sweet
biscuit
malt
provides
some
balance
the
finish
is
long
and
hoppy
at
6
5
abv
i
would
say
it
is
mild
soft
ipa
overall
its
pretty
good
better
than
i
was
expecting
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
these
in
the
future
overall
dales
is
my
go
to
pale
ale
and
i
pick
some
up
anytime
in
hudson
opinion
overall
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
it
pretty
much
has
all
of
the
elements
you
expect
lots
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
bitter
finish
and
there
is
some
malt
to
partake
in
too
i
imagine
that
this
would
be
a
different
beer
if
the
carbonation
was
at
least
twice
what
it
is
for
this
example
so
on
tap
it
would
be
a
different
experience
and
i
may
try
it
someday
as
it
is
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
the
sixpack
but
i
will
probably
stick
to
others
if
i
just
want
to
enjoy
a
pale
ale
overall
a
great
beer
to
take
on
a
hike
or
camping
i
love
what
oskar
blues
is
doing
by
making
great
beer
portable
o
well
i
must
say
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
poured
from
a
can
this
is
just
a
very
solid
beer
and
would
be
a
great
one
for
outdoor
trips
or
tailgates
really
really
am
enjoying
it
o
an
extremely
sessionable
pale
ale
not
quite
as
intense
as
an
ipa
but
it
is
a
stand
out
for
the
style
if
i
were
offered
this
or
sierra
nevada
i
would
demand
a
dales
pale
ale
fantastic
for
a
canned
beer
this
one
shows
that
canning
is
a
great
way
to
package
beer
and
top
notch
beers
are
no
exception
this
is
the
best
fishin
beer
i
have
found
in
cans
yet
o
this
is
a
terrific
example
of
a
pale
ale
maybe
the
best
ive
had
if
you
like
hoppier
than
usual
beers
for
the
style
dales
is
something
that
you
should
seek
out
do
this
may
be
one
of
the
biggest
and
most
extreme
apas
currently
in
production
the
flavor
profile
comes
across
as
a
multiwave
assault
on
the
palate
but
really
isnt
very
enjoyable
it
seems
like
a
maltforward
ale
until
the
finish
when
harsh
bitterness
sets
inmaking
it
seem
like
a
bit
of
a
mess
o
i
would
be
tickled
silly
to
pack
these
out
for
golf
or
some
other
outdoor
activity
taste
is
smooth
a
bit
hoppy
and
full
of
flavor
it
just
didnt
have
quite
as
much
character
ontap
than
i
usually
find
in
the
can
interesting
still
very
good
o
a
very
nice
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
brew
not
the
most
in
your
face
pale
out
there
but
it
would
be
great
on
many
occasions
if
i
could
get
this
locally
it
would
probably
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
o
a
solid
pale
probably
doesnt
beat
out
sierra
nevada
or
some
of
the
other
greats
in
the
style
for
me
but
still
a
worthy
beer
overall
solid
pickup
thanks
to
spinrsx
who
told
me
to
buy
it
would
def
stock
this
and
would
me
a
great
session
beer
little
more
bitterness
than
snpa
but
very
good
o
definitely
hoppier
than
a
normal
pale
ale
so
for
me
at
least
it
is
a
little
bit
less
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
abv
is
also
uite
high
for
a
pale
ale
so
you
need
to
be
careful
with
this
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
low
head
and
moderate
lacing
fairly
clear
orange
ipa
color
smell
is
certainly
of
good
hops
pleasant
and
tropical
flavor
is
outstanding
balance
of
pine
sweet
tropical
fruit
and
a
light
bready
character
pleasant
bitterness
and
mellow
vibes
mouthfeel
is
medium
although
this
beer
carries
itself
and
doesnt
leave
me
hanging
this
is
really
once
of
the
best
sipas
that
ive
ever
had
this
pours
hazy
pale
orange
and
has
big
chunky
head
and
good
retention
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
some
hops
as
well
this
taste
is
well
rounded
bitter
and
sweet
with
a
high
malt
presence
there
is
a
nice
bitter
bite
to
this
as
well
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
with
a
medium
body
very
good
i
have
also
rated
this
beer
from
draft
and
i
thought
it
was
a
little
more
hoppy
probably
better
overall
from
the
draft
overall
i
love
the
sweet
malts
and
the
way
they
balance
with
the
hops
to
make
such
a
nice
ale
i
give
a
thumbs
up
too
this
one
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
o
pours
a
toffee
brown
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hops
on
the
nose
hops
up
front
with
distinctive
citrus
and
pine
notes
sweet
malts
and
caramel
following
finishes
dry
and
crisp
with
a
little
bitterness
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
dales
pale
poured
an
orangeamber
hue
right
off
the
bat
you
could
smell
the
hops
very
strong
hints
of
pine
needles
and
maybe
even
some
sort
of
fruit
a
very
strong
hop
bitterness
for
beginning
to
end
the
hops
even
some
to
intensify
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
american
pale
ales
that
ive
ever
had
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
any
apa
lovers
out
there
overall
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
other
ones
and
has
an
overbearing
aftertaste
it
might
work
well
with
a
food
pairing
but
by
itself
not
so
much
unless
youre
really
in
the
mood
for
a
lingering
hop
assault
osolid
brew
i
would
definitely
buy
this
if
it
was
available
to
me
thanks
to
boralyl
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
o
more
of
an
ipa

a
pale

good

from

m
at

abv
i
would
almost
consider
this
an
ipa
but
the
bitterness
and
hops
are
not
overwhelming
enough
to
do
this
i
think
this
beer
blurs
the
line
between
apa
and
american
ipa
overall
a
nice
beer
notes
this
is
another
solid
pale
medium
bodied
and
flavorful
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
something
tells
me
that
when
oskar
blues
brews
their
beer
they
have
food
and
pairing
in
mind
this
one
would
accompany
just
about
anything
this
is
one
of
the
best

ive
had

on

overall
a
great
refreshing
beer
that
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
it
sets
the
bar
very
high
for
canned
beers
bold
and
bitter
in
the
taste
lots
of
hops
and
sharply
bitter
this
beer
is
no
slouch
slight
fruitiness
of
oranges
in
the
background
but
all
of
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
hoppy
bitterness
its
by
no
means
balanced
and
could
almost
be
considered
an
ipa
but
the
boldness
of
the
flavoring
makes
it
work
the
hop
taste
sticks
around
for
a
while
after
the
sip
making
your
palate
surrender
to
the
bitterness
more
than
solid
but
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
guys
in
one
sitting
very
heavy
on
the
bitterness
making
it
hard
for
your
mouth
to
keep
up
with
it
still
one
of
if
not
my
number
1
goto
pale
ale
very
creamy
mouthfeel
thats
crisp
and
full
on
carbonation
yet
enjoyable
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
a
very
good
feel
overall
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
middle
of
the
road
as
far
as
a
style
but
very
above
average
in
taste
a
really
nice
beer
that
is
to
me
the
best
session
can
beer
ive
consistently
had
especially
since
it
is
perfect
year
round
in
any
setting
nice
looking
can
leads
to
a
nice
appearance
score
the
nose
was
faint
hops
not
much
came
through
the
can
though
regardless
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
and
drinkability
the
light
hop
profile
mixes
perfectly
with
a
light
male
sweetness
to
create
a
distinctly
quaffable
pale
ale
that
is
both
hoppy
but
also
as
drinkable
as
a
light
lager
the
hops
are
faintly
citrusy
with
some
bitterness
that
doesnt
go
overboard
good
carbonation
and
an
easy
mouthfeel
im
very
impressed
ob
now
as
pale
ales
go
this
is
about
the
opposite
of
a
beer
like
hoppy
birthday
from
alpine
which
is
a
feat
as
a
low
abv
hop
bomb
this
is
more
about
sitting
around
the
camp
fire
with
a
few
brews
and
as
that
it
is
a
winner
d
excellent
my
goto
summer
time
beer
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
no
body
makes
a
better
canned
beer
than
oskar
blues
overall
i
can
see
myself
buying
another
case
of
it
since
its
around
the
3032
mark
i
love
how
hoppy
this
beer
is
and
it
even
drinks
great
months
after
its
canned
on
date
pretty
much
the
best
pale
ale
thats
like
an
ipa
in
a
can
around
my
neck
of
the
woods
great
beer
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
color
is
good
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
just
didnt
pop
maybe
i
worked
myself
up
for
this
too
much
before
drinking
found
this
beer
to
be
like
many
other
average
ipas
with
just
a
little
more
flavor
but
an
excellent
pour
coming
from
a
can
good
stuff
its
a
bit
big
for
a
pale
ale
but
i
would
say
above
average
and
well
worth
trying
then
buying
again
final
thought
i
love
you
osker
blues
overall
excellent
beer
proves
that
good
things
can
come
in
a
can
hoppier
maltier
and
higher
abv
than
your
standard
pale
ale
i
personally
would
classify
this
as
an
ipa
i
strongly
suggest
this
to
anybody
that
loves
ipas
and
wants
a
pale
ale
that
taste
just
like
one
the
rich
tasting
astringent
hops
really
shine
through
in
this
beer
the
sweetness
does
take
a
back
seat
but
if
it
didnt
have
any
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
then
this
would
really
be
even
more
bitter
than
it
is
an
exceptional
beer
by
oskar
blues
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
simple
pale
ale
in
a
can
a
nice
alternative
to
pbr
etc
for
an
outdoor
event
picnic
etc
i
like
it
its
not
wowing
me
but
its
a
good
tasty
pale
ale
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
i
can
imagine
it
tasting
much
better
fresh
on
tap
i
will
surely
buy
this
again
for
the
right
outdoor
situation
o
this
beer
does
everything
it
supposed
to
do
it
holds
true
to
its
style
and
its
in
a
can
i
want
to
go
camping
with
dales
vey
soon
o
for
hop
lover
this
a
dream
of
a
pale
ale
great
hopiness
nice
citrus
and
pine
flavors
that
you
expect
in
an
ipa
yet
clean
and
sessionable
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
on
any
given
day
not
to
mention
its
awesome
for
throwing
in
the
back
pack
for
a
snowboard
session
or
packing
in
the
cooler
for
fishing
on
the
boat
medium
body
and
carbonation
bitterness
bitterness
bitterness
in
the
best
possible
hop
kind
of
way
o
hit
the
spot
a
solid
balanced
hopped
pale
ale
not
as
complex
as
what
i
typically
go
for
and
i
would
not
seek
it
out
just
to
have
it
given
choices
but
i
would
gladly
accept
it
when
offered
and
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
very
drinkable
and
it
comes
in
a
cool
can
poured
a
nice
copper
orange
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
and
some
light
lacing
smell
is
citrus
with
the
hops
coming
through
taste
is
very
good
great
bitter
hop
flavor
almost
tastes
closer
to
an
ipa
either
way
its
delicious
went
down
really
smooth
great
light
bodied
beer
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
it
will
definitely
purchase
again
o
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
no
alpha
kong
but
very
tasty
very
pleasantly
surprised
of
course
why
would
i
be
they
do
make
the
ten
fidy
worth
trying
but
not
a
must
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
and
it
lived
up
to
my
internal
hype
very
nice
and
a
fresher
example
would
probably
have
been
great
o
nice
brew
and
fairly
drinkable
this
is
also
another
new
option
popping
up
in
shops
here
in
nh
while
i
enjoyed
it
ill
likely
stick
to
some
locals
o
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
enjoy
and
extremely
well
balanced
none
of
the
flavors
in
particular
stand
out
or
are
extremely
special
in
their
own
way
but
thats
what
is
making
this
become
more
and
more
of
a
staple
in
my
fridge
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
lasting
head
smells
very
hoppy
and
bitter
the
taste
is
hoppy
very
bitter
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
of
the
end
hops
stay
arounf
the
paletee
for
a
while
overall
a
very
apa
ejoyed
this
one
and
would
get
it
again
so
i
am
in
new
hampshire
for
the
great
bay
half
marathon
its
the
night
before
a
race
and
why
not
drink
some
ok
alot
of
the
local
beer
sitting
at
the
portsmouth
brewering
co
and
ordered
a
dales
thinking
it
was
local
not
from
colorado
still
quite
tasty
this
beer
has
was
copper
in
color
with
thin
white
head
and
great
lace
the
smell
has
a
subtle
pinecitrus
this
beer
has
a
piney
taste
that
tickles
the
tongue
that
has
a
nice
balance
in
maltyness
the
smell
funnels
into
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
light
abv
leads
to
this
beer
being
a
session
certainly
worth
a
taste
although
i
would
have
liked
more
of
the
hops
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
to
have
come
through
in
the
taste
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
might
be
a
slightly
old
can
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
with
more
flavor
than
a
macrobrew
id
say
its
worth
checking
out
overall
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
most
highly
touted
pale
ales
in
the
country
this
is
a
pale
ale
that
is
strictly
for
the
hop
heads
but
if
you
can
handle
the
hops
you
can
also
handle
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
beers
12oz

orange

with
a

not
nearly
as
dry
as
most
u
s
pales
this
one
refreshes
the
palate
while
delivering
lots
of
hop
goodness
in
that
regard
it
reminds
of
bells
two
hearted
ale
overall
dales
would
be
my
standby
session
beer
if
it
was
available
in
ontario
a
delicious
and
easy
drinking
apa
o
very
nice
brew
drinks
more
like
a
5
5
abv
than
a
6
5
ive
had
dales
before
and
remember
enjoying
it
much
more
this
experience
revealed
the
beer
to
be
far
too
soapy
and
bitter
overall
not
my
cup
of
ipa
o
a
really
nice
flavorful
canned
ale
here
alot
more
flavor
than
your
standard
pale
ale
this
beer
has
a
nice
complexity
about
it
while
maintaining
high
drinkability
nice
combo
darkerside
of
the
caramel
spectrum
as
far
as
pas
go
sweet
malt
dank
hops
on

mmm
nice

finished
from
floral
hops
a

thin
to

um
yeah
nice
pa
they
put
together
not
sure
what
my
overall
score
is
but
my
drinkability
is
a
solid

im
not
a
pale
ale
drinker
and
this
one
is
a
typical
reason
why
its
completely
neutral
in
my
mouth
oskar
blues
does
amazing
beer
and
this
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
my
mouth
i
might
be
able
to
enjoy
it
with
a
steak
on
a
patio
on
a
summer
day
but
i
think
i
could
also
enjoy
a
lot
better
one
than
this
let
this
be
one
of
the
last
beers
you
have
from
them
the
color
is
the
amber
youd
expect
and
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
with
some
faint
malt
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
foundation
i
dont
find
much
complexity
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
the
drinkability
is
damn
good
a
very
balanced
wellmade
brewski
this
was
my
first
experience
w
oskar
blues
and
i
wasnt
let
down
i
do
want
to
try
this
one
again
one
day
much
fresher
once
again
this
is
an
ipa
not
a
pale
ale
very
refreshing
brew
drinkability
i
can
put
it
down
but
im
not
super
enthusiastic
about
this
beer
i
would
never
turn
one
down
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
i
highly
recommend
this
ale
for
any
occasion
overall
i
really
really
like
this
one
and
its
become
a
warm
weather
go
to
beer
for
me
the
feel
is
good
nice
light
body
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
around
one
that
i
can
keep
in
the
fridge
and
share
with
company
medium
body
consistent
with
the
style
but
with
a
large
hop
punch
d
its
drinkable
but
because
i
kept
being
reminded
of
a
watered
down
taste
it
didnt
exactly
make
me
want
to
imediately
crack
another
man
o
man
if
they
just
could
amp
this
brew
up
a
bit
and
make
each
ingredient
pop
a
little
more
it
could
be
a
great
brew
seems
flat
uninspiring
and
bland
moreys
bottom
line
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
its
tasty
too
its
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
advertised
imo
though
not
sure
how
old
this
can
was
but
its
definitely
good
the
beer
had
a
lighter
feel
good
carbonation
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
one
of
the
better
apas
that
i
have
had
and
one
that
i
will
go
to
again
my
goto
beer
in
a
can
not
overpowering
or
impressive
in
anyway
but
a
great
american
pale
ale
none
the
less
a
great
beer
for
those
looking
to
expand
their
palate
from
the
big
3
orangecopper
with
a
thick
frothy
head
very
cloudy
and
lots
of
lacing
plenty
of
citrus
mixes
with
pine
and
a
hint
of
light
malt
in
the
aroma
both
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
are
more
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
but
not
exactly
at
first
the
beer
seems
rather
light
bodied
with
a
quick
rush
of
acidic
citrus
earthy
pine
and
floral
hops
a
subdued
malty
sweetness
then
joins
in
but
then
is
once
very
hoppy
the
flavors
are
excellent
and
the
there
is
a
slightly
dry
and
yet
someone
creamy
finish
a
great
beer
but
alittle
high
in
abv
for
a
pale
ale
also
its
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
would
expect
from
the
style
but
its
not
exactly
an
ipa
either
a
very
good
beer
that
doesnt
need
to
be
classified
by
any
particular
style
the
cpj
a
very
good
one
from
ob
my
alabama
friends
are
baffled
that
such
tastes
came
from
a
can
keep
it
up
oskar
blues
had
a
can
of
this
last
night
at
little
big
burger
in
portland
or
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
a
very
good
beer
especially
for
beer
in
a
can
its
hoppy
but
not
bitter
at
all
and
has
a
sweet
finish
all
in
all
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
at
6
5
abv
its
got
a
nice
kick
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
considering
the
can
d
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
bring
these
out
on
the
golf
course
great
flavor
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
high
to
session
more
than
a
couple
or
three
love
the
screen
on
the
back
of
the
can
so
co
a
quality
brew
for
sure
i
would
and
will
drink
it
again
but
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
canned
competition
in
the
rocky
mountain
west
an
all
around
contender
for
sure
pours
a
bright
orange
colour
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
as
the
head
dissipates
some
lacing
on
the
glass
nice
citrus
hops
with
a
very
nice
breadycaramel
malt
balance
some
bitterness
in
the
flavour
nice
sweetness
to
the
beer
very
balanced
pale
ale
this
could
easily
be
an
everyday
or
dinner
beer
smooth
mouthfeel
a
good
if
not
great
session
beer
understandable
why
dales
has
become
the
standard
for
canned
craft
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
pale
ale
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
smell
gets
you
right
from
get
go
and
sucks
you
into
this
experience
that
will
not
soon
be
forgotten
not
as
good
as
burning
river
pale
ale
but
more
readily
available
for
me
which
is
a
win
in
my
books
a
very
drinkable
pale
not
very
sessionable
but
then
again
session
beers
and
packing
it
in
dont
really
match
well
done
pretty
hop
forward
for
a
pale
ale
which
is
fine
with
me
good
flavors
would
have
liked
to
have
less
carbonation
notes
this
one
is
a
straight
forward
american
pale
ale
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
to
it
cheers
a
dry
finish
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
i
edit
this
review
after
my
fourth
dales
pale
ale
because
man
this
really
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
fantastic
ive
been
on
a
pale
ale
kick
lately
and
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
dales
its
really
good
but
i
dont
know
if
it
10
996pk
good
beer
geeks
love
this
stuff
is
it
cause
for
a
pale
ale
itll
kick
your
ass
is
this
an
imperial
pa
is
it
an
esb
whatever
the
nose
is
not
super
amazing
but
the
balance
is
what
makes
this
not
an
ipa
is
how
quickly
the
malts
roll
under
the
hops
when
you
take
a
sip
the
buttery
malt
swirls
with
the
hops
in
your
mouth
just
right
its
hard
to
get
such
a
nice
balance
at
6
5
this
is
a
well
thought
out
pale
ale
if
you
ask
me
id
call
this
an
esb
pretty
good
pale
ale
it
seemed
more
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
to
me
due
to
the
strength
of
some
of
the
flavors
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
very
bitter
right
from
the
start
i
wasnt
expecting
that
i
dont
ususally
drink
from
cans
but
i
had
to
try
this
ten
bucks
for
a
six
pack
of
cans
seems
a
bit
steep
especially
since
there
isnt
too
much
special
about
this
beer
but
after
the
first
one
went
down
it
wasnt
as
bitter
as
the
first
add
a
frosty
mug
and
your
good
to
go
great
drink
ability
a
rather
hoppy
pale
and
i
really
like
em
that
way
for
me
ya
cant
go
wrong
with
a
can
of
dales
drinkability
is
very
good
cans
make
it
more
portable
than
many
good
craft
beers
this
one
is
a
winner
d
good
stuff
a
goto
canned
beer
packs
some
kick
so
drink
in
moderation
but
doesnt
command
the
respect
of
gordon
very
pleasant
poured
into
my
fw
pint
glass
from
the
can
instant
beautiful
white
head
about
one
finger
high
that
recedes
to
good
lacing
around
the
glass
and
a
thin
white
ring
color
is
golden
to
a
slight
orange
that
you
can
see
all
the
way
through
looks
like
a
damn
good
apa
or
ipa
depending
on
how
you
consider
your
ipas
smells
of
fresh
resinous
and
piney
hops
not
much
in
the
way
of
citrus
or
anything
of
that
sort
some
sweet
malt
and
grainy
barley
characteristics
also
show
through
to
balance
the
nose
upfront
is
more
bitterness
than
i
had
expected
this
leads
me
to
feel
that
this
is
more
of
an
ipa
then
an
apa
as
the
hops
seem
to
weight
a
bit
more
heavily
in
my
mouth
and
in
the
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
makes
me
immediately
want
another
one
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
at
6
5
percent
i
could
probably
go
all
night
with
them
i
was
impressed
with
this
brew
as
i
dont
shoot
to
hard
to
get
pale
ales
compared
to
the
other
available
brews
around
dhmmm
this
is
good
the
whole
way
through
it
goes
down
so
quickly
this
is
the
first
apa
that
i
truly
enjoyed
ill
be
telling
my
friends
about
this
one
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
good
balance
of
flavors
and
a
twist
of
peach
to
make
this
one
unique
d
this
is
my
favorite
drinkable
beer
its
my
favorite
session
beer
all
around
a
very
solid
choice
using
astmd
helps
me
think
about
a
beer
but
im
getting
to
the
point
where
i
might
stop
using
it
and
i
might
comment
less
on
the
drinkability
d
pretty
goof
if
your
an
ipa
drinker
or
a
pale
ale
drinker
try
it
out
d
an
easily
drinkable
apa
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
great
go
to
pale
o
a
tasty
pale
ale
i
love
that
its
in
a
can
i
can
take
this
beer
to
the
park
or
to
the
beach
with
no
problem
at
all
its
well
rounded
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
friend
i
play
cards
with
brought
these
about
a
month
ago
and
convinced
me
to
try
one
glad
i
did
i
have
since
had
ol
chub
and
ten
fidy
very
drinkable
great
hoppy
bitter
pale
in
a
can
ready
to
go
also
great
on
tap
deviant
dales
is
even
better
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
it
is
very
solid
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
ive
had
it
when
i
bought
it
from
somewhere
that
doesnt
rotate
their
stock
enough
and
its
not
very
good
but
fresh
this
beer
is
great
its
pretty
cool
to
be
able
to
review
this
beer
on
tap
from
my
own
set
up
at
my
buddies
house
d
mellow
smooth
and
easily
consumable
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
its
in
a
can
light
golden
yellow
pour
with
an
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
with
a
nice
presnce
of
hops
to
go
along
with
it
the
flavor
is
good
just
like
the
aroma
malt
and
hops
it
leaves
a
nice
pleasant
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
the
glass
ended
up
having
some
nice
lacing
on
it
tasty
overall
a
decent
apa
but
nothing
special
there
are
definitely
much
better
apas
out
there
so
i
wouldnt
search
this
one
out
and
id
probably
go
with
something
else
most
of
the
time
pours
a
nice
farily
clear
pale
golden
color
a
modest
half
finger
white
head
initial
smell
is
a
good
amount
of
canibus
then
some
citrus
maybe
some
rubber
band
taste
is
initialy
neutral
then
to
some
sweetness
quite
a
bit
of
earthiness
some
canibus
again
in
the
taste
some
lingering
earthy
bitterness
on
the
finish
quite
complex
overall
medium
bodied
medium
carbing
goes
down
fairly
well
1
75
a
single
d
very
drinkable
but
the
higher
than
most
pale
ales
abv
might
take
its
toll
as
will
the
resiny
hoppiness
of
this
brew
65
ibus
wow
pretty
big
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
very
easy
drink
i
could
go
all
evening
with
this
brew
its
abv
isnt
to
high
so
almost
anyone
can
enjoy
its
as
big
as
a
pale
ale
can
be
while
still
being
a
pale
ale
another
great
brew
by
oskar
blues
and
brewery
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
many
of
these
especially
with
the
cans
that
is
if
i
wanted
too
overall
impression
solid
pale
ale
in
spite
of
the
distracting
booziness
while
they
finished
the
deed
i
readied
the
cans
for
the
great
consumption
they
arrived
back
at
the
training
site
and
were
greeted
with
a
pair
of
cracks
mmm
straight
out
the
can
proper
serving
vessel
if
you
ask
me
too
bitter
for
my
man
nate
but
jeannette
crushed
the
other
can
while
i
finished
mine
savoring
the
floral
and
citrus
the
brush
of
grainy
malt
and
the
bitter
spine
a
damn
fine
brew
and
the
perfect
time
for
a
safety
break
d
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
more
or
less
d
considering
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
glass
wasnt
particularly
enjoyable
at
least
i
could
spend
the
first
8
ounces
trying
to
decide
if
it
really
was
butter
i
was
smelling
not
particularly
recommended
though
based
on
the
large
number
of
positive
reviews
here
it
may
be
worth
checking
out
this
one
is
basic
buy
it
for
times
when
you
are
not
really
interested
in
focusing
on
the
beer
and
value
drinkability
over
depth
of
flavors
a
solid
basic
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
that
has
its
place
ill
buy
more
again
for
events
just
not
for
home
drinkingrelaxing
overall
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
or
this
beer
to
push
any
envelopes
d
a
beer
you
could
have
34
of
and
not
blink
an
eye
although
not
a
true
session
beer
due
to
the
abv
being
above
5
but
i
could
see
drinking
these
one
after
another
froth
turns
to
a
dusting
of
white
lace
all
the
way
down
bright
copper
color
has
a
nice
sparkle
in
the
light
quick
nose
blitz
of
citric
and
pine
from
the
hops
with
some
maltiness
and
fruit
in
the
back
smoothness
drops
on
the
palate
quickly
and
then
the
other
shoe
drops
with
a
crest
of
hops
that
rides
strong
with
bitterness
and
citric
earthy
mint
and
pine
flavors
that
push
hard
against
a
bready
caramel
malt
alcohol
kicks
in
late
with
some
warmth
and
fruitiness
blurring
the
lines
of
pale
ale
and
ipa
such
an
amazing
canned
beer
pours
a
bright
tarnished
bronze
color
pour
produces
a
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
nose
is
a
bit
faint
some
light
malts
and
fruity
hops
taste
is
not
so
faint
sweet
malts
up
front
then
some
american
hops
that
tangle
well
with
a
grainy
finish
a
bit
hoppy
for
an
apa
though
that
is
my
preference
it
might
not
be
for
everyone
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
not
overdone
might
not
be
my
new
go
to
but
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
at
some
point
surprised
by
the
english
ale
characteristics
of
this
very
enjoyable
canned
beer
with
its
autumnal
amber
cloudyunfiltered
posture
and
compact
almost
casklike
creamyfoamy
offwhite
head
and
thick
bands
of
lace
and
its
relaxed
smooth
quasiviscous
malty
body
this
thing
drinks
similar
to
a
british
cask
ale
sulfates
added
could
be
the
malts
but
wouldnt
be
shocked
if
the
hops
have
much
to
do
with
the
sugarsweetness
in
the
smell
backed
up
and
perhaps
surpassed
by
the
fruitpunch
juicy
hops
a
toasted
bent
to
the
light
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
nutty
in
the
back
but
once
again
the
hops
rule
here
only
marginally
bitter
a
predominantly
orange
citrus
tone
throughout
but
finishes
decidedly
lemony
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
with
only
a
trace
of
carb
sizzle
in
spite
of
a
few
hearty
braps
happy
that
the
levelpotency
of
hops
didnt
detract
from
indulging
in
a
good
swill
or
two
however
considering
the
englishcask
feel
id
be
curious
to
try
this
with
the
hops
toned
down
a
tad
a
pleasant
pa
indeed
notes
still
a
goto
when
im
looking
for
something
a
bit
lighter
ontap
at
3
a
pint
at
tryst
why
not
drink
ability
is
really
nice
on
this
light
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
despite
the
decent
amount
of
abv
with
a
6
5
if
this
was
on
tap
at
my
local
bar
id
stick
with
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
that
doesnt
try
to
push
the
envelope
its
a
well
balanced
mellow
brew
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
light
session
or
pairing
with
poultry
ive
always
liked
dales
and
i
like
the
ontap
version
even
better
dgreat
pale
ale
will
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
decent
beer
not
what
i
look
for
in
an
apa
but
gets
the
job
done
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
half
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
nicely
as
you
drink
aroma
is
fairly
weak
but
has
hints
of
fruity
hops
and
some
malty
sweetness
taste
consists
of
strong
fruity
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
but
doesnt
have
any
bad
aftertastes
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
minimal
amounts
of
spotty
head
and
lacing
scent
brings
a
pleseant
fresh
grassy
and
citrus
hop
profile
touch
of
pine
and
noticeable
clean
malts
taste
follows
scent
the
hops
are
fairly
firm
and
aggressive
for
the
style
more
grass
and
pine
touch
of
citrus
malt
is
clean
and
not
overly
sweet
some
charachteristics
of
straw
medium
bodied
higher
carbonation
but
minimal
head
a
nice
flavorful
pale
ale
right
up
with
sierra
in
terms
of
construction
d
pretty
good
this
beer
overall
reminds
me
of
snpa
a
good
beer
with
no
qualities
that
really
stand
out
to
me
perfect
choice
to
go
with
if
you
feel
like
downing
a
sixpack
and
watching
some
football
12oz
can
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
some
lacing
aromas
of
hops
sweet
caramel
and
grains
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
mild
hop
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
bread
and
caramel
flavors
slight
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
with
a
lot
of
flavor
to
it
drinkable
and
tasty
worth
buying
again
d
it
nice
and
drinkable
it
wouldnt
necessarily
be
my
first
choice
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
d
all
day
kind
of
beer
right
here
this
is
pretty
much
what
it
would
taste
like
if
you
actually
tapped
the
rockies
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
smallish
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
citric
hops
with
some
faint
malt
and
fruit
very
hoppy
hop
bitterness
hits
the
palate
first
and
comes
through
again
in
the
finish
taste
is
almost
completely
floral
hops
malts
try
to
poke
through
but
get
smashed
back
down
by
the
hops
decent
mouthfeel
pops
around
in
the
mouth
a
lighter
medium
body
the
perfect
level
of
bitterness
coupled
with
the
body
makes
this
one
very
easily
drinkable
d
goes
down
smooth
and
fast
for
6
5
great
beer
especially
to
have
on
draught
at
home
d
a
bit
hefty
as
a
pale
but
then
i
think
they
market
more
to
the
west
coast
with
its
caramelly
malts
relatively
rich
body
higher
abv
and
bordering
on
aggressive
hops
this
is
distinctly
strong
apa
style
pale
even
trending
toward
ipa
territory
many
pales
are
total
session
beers
this
one
is
sort
of
heading
in
the
other
direction
all
said
and
done
it
is
very
good
though
also
i
drank
this
out
of
a
glass
and
must
admit
its
better
straight
out
of
the
can
i
think
you
lose
some
carbination
and
overall
yeast
and
hop
flavor
by
pouring
into
glass
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
for
just
sitting
around
drinking
or
to
pair
with
spicy
foods
its
versatile
and
delicious
highly
recommended
dgreat
this
beer
is
a
sessionable
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
perfect
for
a
hot
day
in
miami
i
imagine
that
this
is
perfect
with
a
good
juicy
burger
or
so
if
you
havent
tried
it
do
it
now
d
nice
and
drinkable
apa
nothing
to
wild
going
on
but
a
good
solid
thirst
quenching
brew
pours
a
flat
medium
amber
color
with
a
with
a
big
frothy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
floralcitric
hops
on
the
palate
light
and
refreshing
at
first
although
the
sweetness
begins
to
bog
this
one
down
about
halfway
through
hoppy
and
good
but
this
beer
would
probably
be
enjoyed
more
if
i
didnt
have
it
from
a
can
color
is
pale
with
good
but
a
little
fizzy
head
aroma
is
hoppy
not
like
sierra
nevada
but
pretty
good
hops
none
the
less
the
flavor
is
a
little
bitter
but
in
general
a
good
clean
and
complex
flavor
i
knew
from
the
getgo
it
was
going
to
be
hard
for
this
pale
ale
to
live
up
to
all
its
hype
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
good
pour
and
crisp
aroma
of
hops
citrus
honey
and
earthy
tones
light
body
with
good
balance
of
carbonation
hops
and
citrus
dokay
beer
i
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
for
sure
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
might
camp
with
it
not
very
complex
but
thirst
quenching
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
plan
on
drinking
a
lot
more
if
it
i
also
want
to
try
the
rest
of
this
brewers
lineup
for
sure
worth
seeking
out
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
carbonation
a
little
on
the
low
side
given
my
underwhelmed
response
to
this
beer
im
obviously
not
going
to
consider
it
hugely
drinkable
not
terrible
by
any
means
just
not
my
particular
cup
of
tea
nice
beer
my
roommates
are
raving
about
it
but
i
am
not
as
impressed
as
them
d
very
drinkable
good
solid
goto
beer
d
first
beer
on
a
postexam
night
and
it
tastes
great
this
is
a
great
looking
a
tasting
pale
ale
that
ill
pick
up
again
if
i
see
it
the
drinkability
is
high
mostly
because
this
is
one
of
the
two
or
three
goto
beers
for
lugging
along
to
a
summer
bbq
or
camping
trip
despite
the
abv
4
or
5
of
these
go
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
awesome
and
just
mild
enough
to
session
d
one
of
the
best
beers
youll
have
from
a
can
4
0
overall
a
nice
surprise
out
of
the
can
hops
are
big
and
smooth
creamy
malts
balance
well
sweet
notes
take
back
seat
alcohol
presense
gave
it
more
of
a
dipa
feel
worth
a
try
pours
a
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
pretty
good
lacing
the
nose
is
straight
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
only
a
bit
of
light
bread
in
the
background
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
hoppy
and
has
a
mild
malty
character
good
body
with
a
bit
of
dryness
and
nice
carbonation
drinks
quite
well
and
is
a
great
all
around
beer
in
fact
one
through
which
ive
introduced
quite
a
few
people
to
craft
this
beer
has
a
perfect
weight
and
feel
in
the
mouth
what
id
call
a
soft
bitternes
coats
the
palate
a
very
smooth
finish
and
a
delicious
hoppy
taste
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
it
its
just
what
youd
want
from
an
american
pale
ale
this
is
my
first
canned
craft
beer
and
wont
be
my
last
the
can
is
a
great
way
to
store
beer
and
i
just
wish
more
craft
brewers
would
use
it
i
mean
come
on
in
terms
of
space
taken
up
you
can
fit
two
cans
where
one
bottle
goes
we
all
pour
into
glasses
anyway
bring
on
the
cans
an
easy
to
drink
beer
not
a
pale
ale
but
pretty
boring
it
pours
up
thick
for
a
pale
ale
reddish
orange
hue
with
a
good
2
finger
sticky
head
smells
of
citrus
and
crisp
mouth
feel
is
a
good
medium
body
not
to
thick
and
def
not
thin
its
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
pale
ales
so
that
may
be
why
i
enjoy
it
so
much
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
overall
not
sure
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
dales
pale
ale
its
an
awesome
beer
and
it
just
happens
to
be
on
a
can
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
more
often
d
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
around
great
balance
hopped
to
perfection
nothing
showy
or
flashy
just
straight
up
good
drinkability
is
quite
good
on
my
first
sip
of
this
beer
it
seems
too
thick
and
syrupy
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
but
by
the
time
im
halfway
through
im
enjoying
the
hop
flavors
a
lot
and
it
goes
down
easily
i
think
i
just
expect
a
more
carbonated
crisper
beer
since
it
comes
from
a
can
i
suppose
there
are
better
hoppy
beers
for
a
cheap
price
around
here
though
overall
its
a
decent
beer
d
i
like
dales
but
this
bitter
lemon
rindy
thing
going
on
is
making
we
want
to
switch
what
im
drinking
bottom
line
if
you
like
a
hoppiermorebitterthannormal
pale
this
is
for
you
d
not
a
bad
choice
the
can
made
me
curious
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
very
well
rounded
as
much
as
possible
apa
great
beer
especially
that
it
comes
in
a
canto
me
it
tasted
like
a
more
hopped
up
version
of
sweetwater
420i
think
the
can
preserves
the
tastethe
malt
character
was
greatdef
had
great
hop
presence
as
well
the
lively
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
body
make
this
a
really
bright
beer
but
with
outstanding
aromatics
and
flavor
oskar
blues
your
in
the
winners
seat
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
copper
body
with
a
fingerwidth
dense
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
remains
nicely
laced
aroma
is
loaded
with
sweet
citrus
hops
big
rich
malt
profile
as
well
flavor
is
similar
lots
of
floral
citrus
hops
and
caramels
light
toasted
caramel
comes
through
in
the
finish
lingering
taste
of
resiny
moderate
pine
and
citrus
very
fresh
tasting
palate
is
medium
bodied
and
extremely
well
balanced
overall
this
is
what
an
apa
should
taste
like
fantastic
pours
a
nice
light
orangeamber
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
solid
lacing
and
retention
good
citrus
aroma
good
hops
in
this
apa
sweet
grapefruit
and
orange
hops
to
start
a
little
bready
and
caramel
malt
thrown
in
next
before
a
grassy
and
piney
hop
finish
good
flavor
sweetness
balances
out
the
intense
hop
profile
for
an
apa
super
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
this
also
bears
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
canned
craft
beer
that
i
ever
drank
i
am
pretty
sure
this
might
be
the
best
camping
beer
ever
though
i
reserve
the
right
to
change
that
assertion
after
i
get
my
hands
on
some
surley
not
a
bad
beer
not
just
one
that
i
personally
love
good
for
those
who
love
their
very
hoppy
beer
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
this
beer
is
sunset
gold
in
color
the
aroma
is
malt
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
loaded
with
citrus
hops
and
has
a
solid
malt
core
the
citrus
fades
to
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
this
is
a
good
everyday
drinker
this
is
more
citrusy
than
other
pale
ales
ive
had
i
like
it
i
feel
as
i
should
be
drinking
this
from
an
aluminum
cup
in
order
to
preserve
the
can
experience
solid
apa
very
close
to
an
ipa
in
my
book
a
good
stand
by
to
have
in
the
fridge
this
would
be
one
great
little
beer
if
only
it
werent
so
high
in
abv
think
about
it
its
in
cans
so
you
can
carry
it
to
sporting
events
the
pool
hiking
etc
who
wants
to
get
that
drunk
while
doing
physical
activities
that
said
the
taste
and
aroma
is
terrific
the
hopiness
spot
on
i
think
this
should
be
labeled
an
ipa
instead
of
pale
ale
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
excellent
id
definitely
drink
this
again
clearly
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
drinkability
for
a
hop
lover
easy
drinking
enjoyable
back
to
back
pounding
is
encouraged
understandably
not
everyone
wants
to
drink
a
12rack
of
hoppy
beer
something
i
plan
on
having
at
my
house
often
for
steelers
games
or
a
night
cap
if
hops
aint
your
thing
then
look
elsewhere
for
a
daily
drinker
great
beer
one
i
come
back
to
on
the
reg
splitting
a
sixer
with
my
dad
tonight
this
first
one
im
drinking
with
some
stacys
pita
chips
and
hummus
nice
balance
the
second
two
will
be
at
dinner
baby
green
salad
with
cranberries
feta
and
walnuts
fellas
dont
knock
it
til
ya
try
it
chicken
breasts
off
the
grill
and
sweet
potato
fries
for
the
main
dish
a
hearty
meal
with
a
hearty
complimentary
beer
dales
pale
ale
phenomenal
12
ounce
can
as
part
of
my
gabf
denver
haul
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
believe
dales
pale
ale
was
one
of
if
not
the
first
craft
canned
beer
pours
a
reddish
hue
with
a
small
fizzy
head
about
a
half
inch
tall
some
lacing
on
this
one
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
caramel
malt
sweetness
it
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
that
could
be
my
nose
and
not
necessarily
a
flaw
light
syrupy
body
good
carbonation
better
bitterness
huge
caramel
toffee
malt
sweetness
is
present
in
this
one
this
is
quite
good
buckets
of
resinous
hops
coat
the
mouth
leaving
behind
a
sticky
residue
malt
sweetness
chases
the
hops
down
the
back
of
the
throat
they
cant
get
rid
of
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
though
i
got
this
can
of
dales
about
two
weeks
ago
so
its
a
bit
old
and
im
sure
the
hop
character
would
be
even
more
pronounced
had
i
drank
it
sooner
still
its
a
very
solid
example
of
the
pale
ale
style
and
quite
enjoyable
i
could
drink
about
3
or
4
of
these
on
a
night
and
go
home
happy
of
the
apas
ive
had
this
is
one
of
the
best
because
i
love
the
malt
character
it
has
without
sacrificing
the
hops
almost
like
a
lighter
version

minute
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
on
cask
at
the
sebago
brewpub
in
scarborough
me
as
part
of
their
full
moon
cask
night
this
review
is
based
off
of
a
halfpint
pour
the
beer
is
colored
light
copper
with
orange
notes
there
is
a
big
offwhite
soapy
head
as
it
settles
there
is
decent
patchy
lace
it
has
a
warm
hoppy
aroma
that
is
both
earthy
and
citruslike
i
taste
light
malts
at
first
but
the
big
hops
come
in
quickly
they
are
oily
and
bitter
it
has
a
great
pale
ale
flavor
the
beer
is
served
at
cellar
temperature
which
i
think
helps
it
a
lot
i
wouldnt
want
this
one
too
cold
it
possesses
a
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
a
small
coat
is
left
on
my
tongue
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
my
second
glass
of
the
evening
its
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
caramel
sweetness
and
grapefruit
hops
dominate
with
a
long
pleasantly
bitter
and
tangy
finish
if
youd
told
me
this
was
an
ipa
i
wouldnt
have
batted
an
eye
whatever
the
classification
this
brew
is
flavorful
and
easydrinking
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
i
appreciate
how
balanced
it
is
pretty
much
the
standard
i
hold
all
pale
ales
too
its
awesome
to
have
cans
i
take
this
to
any
outdoor
endeavor
and
theres
nothing
better
than
sipping
a
dales
in
the
wilderness
i
dont
really
revel
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
its
good
but
not
excellent
on
my
pallate
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
its
pretty
much
clear
of
imperfections
which
is
seemingly
even
more
amazing
considering
the
negative
stereotypes
about
beer
in
a
can
overall
impressive
but
nothing
to
rage
about
in
my
book
salud
dales
hasnt
been
something
ive
sought
out
but
im
tempted
to
try
it
in
their
typical
can
form
now
after
being
impressed
by
their
limited
cask
offering
really
smooth
and
sessionable
this
is
a
great
beer
to
take
hiking
or
to
the
beach
and
it
may
throw
a
few
people
for
a
loop
when
they
taste
how
good
canned
beer
can
be
a
little
too
sharply
hopped
to
rank
it
among
the
best
in
the
style
for
drinkability
but
its
a
darn
good
beer
overall
not
quite
sure
what
a
rocky
mountain
pale
ale
is
but
apparently
this
is
one
6
5
abv
makes
me
think
its
not
a
shy
beer
by
any
means
barely
heard
a
sound
when
i
opened
the
can
which
made
me
think
it
may
have
been
flat
but
it
produced
a
small
froth
poured
from
the
can
it
has
a
nice
white
head
on
it
that
slowly
shrinks
down
leaving
minimal
lacing
not
much
stuck
to
the
glass
beyond
the
initial
layer
actually
honey
colored
hint
of
dry
crackers
in
the
aroma
balanced
aroma
of
some
grain
and
hops
tastes
hoppier
than
it
smells
seems
a
bit
off
balance
to
me
though
im
admittedly
not
a
hophead
light
bodied
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
this
is
something
i
probably
couldnt
make
a
session
out
of
but
sometimes
im
looking
for
that
lasting
hop
flavor
it
really
has
more
hop
flavor
than
actual
bitterness
late
hopping
could
be
the
reason
my
biggest
issue
is
the
discrepancy
between
balance
in
flavor
and
aroma
decent
beer
medium
bodied
smooth
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
will
need
to
pick
this
up
more
often
d
really
drinkable
really
good
beer
and
because
its
in
a
can
perfect
for
tailgating
new
favorite
pale
ale
d
very
drinkable
i
always
grab
a
sixer
of
this
when
i
go
fishing
it
is
bitter
up
front
yet
smoothe
in
the
back
there
is
a
lingering
citrus
bitterness
a
nice
taste
but
not
as
good
on
the
mouthfeel
i
could
still
drink
this
all
day
and
into
the
night
one
of
my
favs
drinkability
super
tasty
and
enjoyable
man
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
there
are
few
pale
ales
i
enjoy
this
much
other
pales
pale
before
dales
i
dig
it
i
dig
ob
too
my
thinking
is
this
if
canning
saves
them
so
much
cash
on
their
end
then
why
as
consumers
as
we
paying
in
at
such
a
high
price
point
overall
id
say
that
for
camping
or
other
outdoor
activities
theres
no
contest
this
is
number
one
its
a
frontrunner
in
other
contexts
too
my
only
hangup
is
that
the
grocery
store
wanted
10
for
a
sixer
knock
off
two
or
three
bucks
and
this
might
just
be
my
pale
ale
of
choice
id
have
to
reserve
judgement
on
that
until
i
try
this
back
to
back
with
stone
pale
drinkability
is
good
too
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
can
it
comes
in
if
you
are
going
somewhere
you
cant
take
a
bottle
i
always
go
looking
for
a
sixer
of
dales
notes
it
seems
dales
has
kept
this
creation
in
a
can
to
make
it
unique
and
that
it
is
in
fact
it
might
be
the
king
of
cans
but
still
it
might
lie
in
that
no
mans
land
where
its
an
above
average
beer
but
not
quite
good
enough
to
justify
the
price
two
dollars
cheaper
a
6pack
i
might
make
an
evening
of
it
mfd
mildly
heavy
on
the
feel
but
an
excellent
session
beer
no
problem
finishing
a
6pk
with
friends
it
is
always
fun
drinking
a
solid
beer
out
of
a
can
a
perfect
camping
beer
for
someone
who
wants
a
decent
beer
while
conserving
space
d
yes
please
upset
i
only
have
one
more
can
tasty
and
wonderful
pretty
orange
color
with
little
but
nice
head
left
some
great
lacing
nose
and
taste
were
both
all
grapefruity
hop
fantasticness
for
me
there
is
definitely
a
caramel
sweetness
in
the
malt
but
it
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
and
that
is
definitely
the
way
i
would
have
to
characterize
this
one
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
an
ipa
but
i
guess
dales
india
pale
ale
doesnt
have
the
same
ring
to
it
in
fact
its
bitter
hoppiness
is
enough
to
make
me
only
want
a
couple
dales
in
one
sitting
great
stuff
from
oskar
blues
as
almost
all
of
their
brews
are
but
i
wish
they
could
cut
the
prices
a
bit
still
a
phenomenal
beer
worth
the
money
and
definitely
one
with
a
cult
following
pours
from
the
12
oz
can
a
light
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
settles
into
a
thick
collar
lively
carbonation
but
not
overcarbonated
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
doughy
malt
with
a
light
touch
of
hops
1st
sip
brings
a
mighty
wallop
of
piney
grapefruity
hops
with
a
slight
hint
of
bready
slightly
sweet
malt
to
provide
balance
the
flavor
is
sort
of
opposite
of
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
falls
right
down
the
middle
not
heavy
or
watery
the
bitter
hops
coat
the
tongue
for
a
good
while
after
the
swallow
and
theres
a
nice
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
see
no
problem
with
sessioning
these
during
the
upcoming
football
season
overall
a
fine
apa
quite
worthy
of
the
praise
recognition
it
has
received
oskar
blues
is
quickly
making
its
way
onto
my
list
of
favorite
breweries
d
i
could
drink
this
every
day
if
i
didnt
appreciate
the
variety
of
all
the
other
good
beer
in
the
world
even
if
i
was
only
drinking
oskar
blues
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
would
peg
this
as
one
of
the
best
tasting
and
sessionable
pale
ales
out
there
at
6
5
abv
its
no
slouch
but
one
could
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
just
because
its
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
have
retried
several
times
and
every
time
i
like
the
beer
even
more
flavors
blend
quite
well
easy
to
drink
but
still
hoppy
and
bold
one
of
the
best
canned
brews
this
is
a
big
apa
its
one
of
my
favs
but
i
think
if
you
scoring
based
on
style
it
takes
a
few
hits
its
probably
much
closer
to
an
ipa
but
even
then
i
wouldnt
score
it
through
the
roof
balanced
maybe
too
much
so
this
would
be
close
to
perfect
if
the
malt
dialed
back
a
bit
great
sessionable
beer
that
might
be
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
score
910
dales
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
pairs
decent
with
most
foods
and
activities
usually
fairly
priced
one
of
my
favorites
overall
not
great
gotta
try
it
again
though
to
confirm
that
nose
to
be
fair
pours
a
light
amber
body
with
a
big
white
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
smells
sweet
and
nutty
but
with
a
big
resin
and
grapefruit
hop
presence
borders
on
an
ipa
smell
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
oily
and
drying
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
lingering
malts
with
a
piney
taste
in
the
aftertaste
too
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
too
but
it
loses
points
for
being
a
bit
too
drying
in
my
opinion
regardless
im
pretty
satisfied
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
if
i
saw
it
and
wanted
a
pale
ale
edit
i
wanted
to
revisit
this
review
slightly
bumped
up
nose
an
taste
after
going
through
a
couple
sixes
of
dales
this
summer
i
really
came
to
love
it
great
out
of
the
can
perfect
compromise
beer
taste
wise
just
damn
good
may
knock
sierra
out
if
1st
for
my
favorite
us
pale
ale
thats
something
drinkability
is
variable
on
this
one
as
some
one
who
appreciates
portable
canned
beer
ive
developed
a
dales
pale
drinkability
scale
5
when
drinking
in
a
canoe

a
beach

its

d
well
having
a
hop
bomb
in
a
can
with
some
malt
character
is
good
by
me
ive
taken
a
few
of
these
on
a
long
summer
hike
in
the
woods
and
cooled
them
off
in
the
stream
for
an
endofday
treat
works
for
me
d
nothing
offensive
but
nbot
much
reason
to
return
in
my
opinion
other
than
the
can
factor
not
sure
why
it
took
me
song
long
to
get
to
this
one
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
the
head
recedes
into
a
patchy
layer
on
top
leaving
decent
lacing
smells
of
lightly
toasted
and
rustic
pale
malts
with
floral
hops
and
hints
of
buttery
diacetyl
tastes
similar
to
how
it
smells
pale
malts
that
have
a
certain
graininess
in
the
flavor
are
joined
by
herbal
and
mild
citrus
hop
flavors
midway
through
the
sip
as
the
beer
warms
the
same
butteriness
that
is
exhibited
in
the
smell
enters
the
flavor
profile
however
its
not
intense
enough
to
be
debilitating
and
may
even
help
pull
the
flavors
together
the
ending
is
mildly
bitter
overall
dales
is
a
winner
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
your
an
ipa
kind
of
person
dales
is
not
far
from
an
ipa
you
need
to
give
it
a
try
its
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
apas
however
i
wouldnt
say
its
too
high
up
there
ah
dales
pale
ale
i
was
introduced
to
this
beer
about
6
years
ago
at
the
brewgrass
festival
in
asheville
nc
and
it
quickly
became
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
pale
ales
i
love
that
it
comes
in
a
can
makes
it
very
easy
to
take
great
beer
with
you
to
the
beach
the
lake
camping
roadtrips
you
name
it
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
which
can
get
you
in
trouble
with
the
6
5
abv
the
hops
could
be
a
little
more
present
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
that
i
like
the
sweetness
that
comes
through
as
well
very
well
balanced
this
is
just
one
of
the
great
offerings
from
oskar
blues
and
a
beer
that
should
be
sought
out
by
all
who
enjoy
this
style
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
as
well
crisp
carbonation
makes
the
creamy
medium
body
feel
light
and
finish
clean
overall
this
is
quite
good
just
not
a
knockout
punch
d
just
finished
my
3rd
and
looking
at
my
4th
really
easy
to
drink
as
long
as
you
love
west
coast
ipas
you
should
enjoy
this
sessionable
beer
beer
is
smooth
with
a
lot
of
late
bitterness
and
a
mild
grainy
aftertaste
its
kind
of
sweet
up
front
it
finishes
nicely
but
overall
its
too
sweet
for
me
dability
pretty
high
if
a
hop
lover
hop
character
is
strong
but
the
beer
is
clean
and
not
overpowering
the
6
5
abv
surprises
me
slightly
didnt
realize
this
while
drinking
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
it
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
apa
category
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
low
head
opens
up
with
a
scent
of
hops
honey
and
oranges
and
tastes
about
the
same
lighter
flavor
than
expected
based
on
smell
taste
doesnt
linger
on
for
too
long
pairing
it
nicely
with
whatever
is
for
dinner
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
for
some
reason
when
i
drink
it
i
really
want
bacon
and
cheddar
just
sayin
d
great
balance
and
clean
flavors
provide
for
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
my
only
wish
is
that
the
abv
were
a
tad
lower
d
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
actual
ipa
than
a
pale
well
balanced
with
great
range
of
flavors
packed
into
this
can
drinkability
very
pleasant
apa
with
dynamic
flavor
not
particurlarly
strong
in
any
area
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
not
necessarily
my
first
choice
in
this
style
but
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
a
nice
beer
for
an
outdoor
occasion
but
by
no
means
a
go
to
dthis
brew
is
now
my
favorite
apa
not
one
to
jump
up
and
down
about
imho
but
a
nice
brew
havent
had
a
bad
oskar
blues
yet
great
mouthfeel
fairly
thin
to
make
it
easy
to
drink
but
by
no
means
watery
high
carbonation
makes
it
feel
thicker
richer
than
it
is
so
it
isnt
filling
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
goes
down
very
easily
nice
beer
awesome
stuff
from
ob
here
dpa
is
almost
a
pale
ale
in
name
only
in
certain
respects
as
the
huge
flavor
and
almost
overdose
of
hops
create
a
pretty
unique
brew
once
again
its
tough
to
miss
with
ob
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
since
ive
had
plenty
over
the
past
couple
of
years
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
with
a
short
but
persistent
cap
of
eggshell
bubbles
mostly
fine
yet
a
few
soapy
ones
are
scattered
around
thick
sticky
lace
big
citrus
in
the
aroma
grapefruit
and
oranges
sugary
and
juicy
slightly
sharp
cotton
candy
moderate
bitterness
not
as
assertive
as
some
bigger
pale
ales
malt
plays
more
of
a
role
in
the
flavour
giving
it
a
grainy
edge
with
some
caramel
and
toasty
sweetness
hops
remained
citrusy
but
were
much
more
restrained
than
in
the
aroma
lingering
dry
bitterness
with
an
herbal
and
grassy
edge
medium
bodied
with
creamy
carbonation
nice
texture
solid
overall
the
aroma
is
a
little
more
impressive
than
the
flavour
but
it
all
holds
together
nicely
cantacular
d
highly
drinkable
and
the
can
makes
it
drinkable
everywhere
you
cant
take
a
bottle
more
please
lucky
i
have
half
a
box
left
overall
this
is
a
very
flavorful
pale
ale
that
is
a
bit
different
than
many
american
examples
of
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
quite
smooth
and
would
like
to
drink
it
again
its
almost
unfair
to
compare
this
to
other
pale
ales
out
there
its
bigger
in
almost
every
sense
and
hopheads
are
sure
to
put
this
a
notch
above
the
likes
of
sierra
nevada
full
sail
and
some
of
the
other
standard
apas
i
am
choosing
to
rate
it
as
something
between
an
apa
and
ipa
and
as
such
it
is
still
a
damn
fine
beer
now
if
only
we
could
get
this
in
oklahoma
d
easy
going
down
and
enjoyable
this
one
is
a
tasty
pale
ale
that
one
can
enjoy
for
a
whole
evening
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
guy
on
tap
in
a
city
thats
not
very
microfriendly
would
like
to
have
ontap
and
fromcan
side
by
side
d
dales
pale
ale
is
an
incredible
brew
while
it
not
only
exemplifies
the
american
version
of
a
pale
ale
the
brew
also
capitalizes
on
being
a
drinkable
brew
the
hopped
up
flavor
is
not
only
notable
it
also
is
tastyy
enough
to
keep
going
down
the
can
is
a
novelty
and
i
believe
oskar
blues
has
become
the
first
mover
in
a
canned
movement
of
craft
that
is
about
to
blow
up
summary
i
was
able
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
one
it
is
a
very
tasty
ale
i
will
buy
this
one
again
if
i
get
the
chance
p
s
i
dont
think
i
had
the
budget
for
an
award
but
you
get
the
idea
a
big
american
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
but
id
rank
it
pretty
high
in
the
pantheon
id
say
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
this
is
a
rich
and
delicious
brew
d
this
might
not
be
the
most
complex
or
best
example
of
an
apa
but
this
drinks
so
well
i
had
two
in
about
10
minutes
im
ashamed
of
myself
overallsolid
solid
solid
beer
one
of
the
best
from
a
can
ive
had
like
the
hops
and
the
flavor
drikability
this
was
a
really
good
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
i
need
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
it
thanks
to

is
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
after
drinking
this
brew
aroma
is
pine
and
citrusy
grapefruit
hops
taste
is
mostly
pine
and
citrusy
hops
along
with
some
sweet
and
bready
malt
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
a
lingering
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
too
bad
this
isnt
available
in
ohio
because
id
buy
it
whenever
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
apa
if
it
was
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
brew
for
years
now
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
in
it
at
all
poured
a
copper
orange
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
light
yellowish
head
that
maintains
a
thin
cap
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
mild
floral
orange
aroma
but
not
citrusy
buttery
aromas
and
feel
well
balanced
malt
and
hop
flavor
with
neither
overtaking
the
other
and
delayed
hoppy
finish
that
doesnt
linger
very
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
very
nice
beer
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
in
oh
and
will
buy
again
d
not
my
first
choice
for
a
pale
ale
i
look
for
something
that
finishes
crisp
and
dry
appearance
is
very
typical
of
the
style
pale
copperorange
color
with
a
soapy
head
that
sticks
has
a
nice
fresh
nose
to
it
lots
of
bright
citrus
scents
that
smell
very
refreshing
taste
is
dominated
by
grapefruit
flavour
from
the
hops
leaving
very
little
room
for
the
malts
or
any
other
depth
of
flavor
still
pretty
tasty
though
perhaps
leaning
more
towards
the
ipa
spectrum
in
flavour
and
strength
a
solid
pale
ale
and
a
worthy
choice
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
pale
ale
it
is
well
balanced
with
a
slight
lean
to
the
hops
portion
it
seems
to
be
somewhere
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
with
an
abv
of
6
5
can
get
you
in
trouble
quickly
if
your
not
careful
the
mouth
feel
is
right
with
the
drinkability
with
enough
boldness
to
make
it
substantial
yet
not
overwhelming
so
that
you
can
have
a
few
oskar
blues
has
impressed
me
with
their
lineup
time
after
time
mmmm
cheers
this
is
by
far
not
the
first
time
i
have
sat
down
to
dales
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
drink
this
one
from
a
can
most
of
the
time
today
however
i
have
poured
this
one
into
one
of
my
pint
glasses
i
do
from
time
to
time
get
dale
into
a
glass
but
the
fact
is
i
enjoy
this
one
near
the
grill
straight
from
the
can
when
poured
dale
takes
a
soapy
topped
head
of
a
near
white
resting
atop
of
what
reminds
me
of
my
grandmothers
sun
tea
the
smell
of
hops
piny
grassy
and
full
of
citric
delight
is
much
more
present
when
not
from
the
can
the
hop
bitterness
and
aromas
are
aplenty
so
feel
free
and
drink
from
the
can
if
you
are
so
inclined
by
convenience
caramel
and
grapefruit
combine
with
ease
sweet
grain
reminds
you
that
this
is
no
light
pale
ale
this
is
dale
the
finish
is
bitter
hops
with
light
caramel
and
grain
the
medium
body
compliments
the
medium
carbonation
this
pale
ale
has
america
written
all
over
it
drinkability
this
beer
has
quite
a
personality
very
drinkable
a
top
tier
american
pale
ale
very
drinkable
im
definitely
gonna
have
plenty
of
this
on
hand
for
fourth
of
july
with
the
red
white
and
blue
color
scheme
and
great
drinkability
drinkability
highly
sessionable
very
good
will
buy
this
in
the
future
good
drinker
from
start
to
finish
so
easy
to
have
another
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
made
in
a
can
i
love
ob
very
smooth
beer
this
stuff
goes
down
like
nectar
medium
bodied
like
an
ipa
perfect
beer
for
summer
activities
i
wish
i
would
have
stocked
up
on
this
while
on
vacation
oskar
blues
needs
to
distribute
to
oklahoma
cmon
we
border
you
it
is
so
great
to
see
canned
craft
beer
in
the
us
as
this
is
a
normal
thing
for
bc
beer
drinkers
opened
up
a
couple
of
these
watching
the
waves
on
the
coast
on
the
olympic
peninsula
poured
into
plastic
glasses
surprised
and
happy
about
the
great
brewery
smell
on
the
nose
and
the
goodly
amount
of
hops
used
in
the
beer
lots
of
complexity
and
still
great
drinkability
for
a
fairly
high
abv
pale
ale
much
more
fragrant
beer
than
say
sierra
nevada
and
is
still
a
bench
mark
beer
in
the
rise
of
canned
craft
beer
scary
drinkability
i
had
no
idea
the
alcohol
content
was
so
high
on
this
very
very
sessionable
a
great
brew
its
scary
that
a
beer
at
6
5
is
this
smooth
refreshing
and
sessionable
cheers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
though
it
is
nothing
outstanding
i
am
impressed
as
i
was
leery
to
believe
a
decent
beer
could
be
found
in
cans

the
flavour
has
also
loads
of
hops
but
they
are
fairly
well
balanced
with
the
malts
there
is
a
substantial
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
long
aftertaste
with
piney
and
grapefruity
notes
wanted
to
try
dales
pale
ale
after
checking
ba
although
i
was
weary
of
the
can
i
found
my
summer
beer
much
to
my
surprise
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
is
everything
that
i
enjoy
in
an
apa
good

finish
every
bit
as
good
as
any
apa
served

i
love
the

on
this
one
and
the

makes
it
soo
much
better
this
is
such
a
great
beer
to
bring
fisbee

solid

easy

another
winner
from
oskar
blues
quite
nice
and
very
drinkable
its
a
remarkably
full
flavored
brew
with
a
strong
kick
goes
down
easier
than
most
6
5
beers
voluminously
hopped
mutha
as
the
can
states
its
a
bit
over
priced
but
a
solid
staple
for
a
strong
flavored
beer
fan
i
particularly
appreciate
the
smooth
drinkability
that
includes
a
hoppy
bite
and
an
appropriately
malty
finish
i
also
must
mention
the
cans
dont
take
away
from
the
flavor
and
add
to
the
experience
if
you
like
this
beer
and
also
really
like
hops
try
the
gordon
it
is
most
delicious
in
the
glass
you
get
to
notice
the
pale
orangecopper
color
and
2
fingers
of
white
head
the
lacing
is
what
really
impresses
me
with
this
beer
like
rings
on
a
tree
this
beers
lace
tells
the
story
of
how
it
was
consumed
the
big
ring
at
the
start
is
that
first
big
sip
to
let
the
beer
overwhelm
me
and
make
its
mark
the
several
smaller
rings
are
the
tasting
sips
in
which
i
played
with
it
a
little
and
tried
to
concentrate
on
each
individual
aspect
of
the
brew
then
theres
the
spotty
midsection
in
which
i
got
distracted
by
my
3
year
old
carrying
around
a
bottle
of
dark
lord
and
in
the
time
it
took
to
put
it
away
he
stole
a
sip
so
in
his
own
words
with
a
giant
smile
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
lit
up
like
christmas
morning
mmmm
d
loved
this
beer
best
in
a
can
i
have
had
very
drinkable
ive
been
really
impressed
with
the
lineup
from
oskar
blues
too
bad
it
is
such
a
pain
in
the
ass
for
me
to
obtain
these
cans
in
nyc
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
beer
for
summer
in
or
out
of
the
can
overall
seems
like
caramel
and
malt
rich
ipa
without
the
hopping
levels
or
dry
hops
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
for
being
so
big
and
rich
if
you
like
a
sweeter
pale
ale
this
is
a
good
one
to
dry
for
me
the
drinkability
suffered
some
still
very
tasty
this
has
been
an
old
standby
for
me
over
the
past
few
years
im
very
glad
that
this
is
widely
available
here
in
mass
ob
has
done
it
again
d
overall
a
pale
ale
that
doesnt
disappoint
the
can
makes
it
taste
really
fresh
too
in
spite
of
the
overt
hoppiness
it
isnt
very
bitter
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
that
it
reminds
me
of
the
rockies
with
its
cool
dry
outdoorsy
qualities
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
as
being
sessionable
its
surprisingly
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
and
is
rather
flavorful
good
pale
ale
with
a
kick
of
hops
to
get
you
excited
a
little
more
hop
and
this
is
an
ipa
a
very
solid
pale
ale
from
ob
the
flavor
is
very
much
standard
apa
but
the
abv
is
reaching
into
ipa
alcohol
isnt
apparent
but
it
dings
the
drinkability
lacks
the
crispness
of
some
apas
like
for
instance
new
belgiums
mighty
arrow
but
another
respectable
oskar
blues
offering
nonetheless
a
very
pleasing
combination
of
flavor
feel
and
drinkability
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
by
the
case
and
just
drink
a
bunch
at
a
party
or
something
its
a
fun
beer
and
a
bunch
of
empty
cans
lying
around
probably
looks
awesome
too
d
though
not
remarkable
in
general
this
is
something
that
is
easy
to
down
a
bunch
of
overall
ill
drink
this
again
as
an
impulse
buy
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
a
solid
beer
from
beginning
to
end
and
easily
sessionable
overall
this
thing
could
be
called
an
ipa
its
hoppy
and
has
a
rather
high
6
5
abv
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
for
7
999
00
bucks
a
sixer
i
can
find
beers
that
i
would
rather
buy
and
drink
but
i
am
glad
i
got
around
to
trying
my
first
oskar
blues
beer
d
this
is
definitely
a
quaffable
brew
and
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
recently
d
a
well
made
drinkable
apa
solid
brew
thats
good
for
anytime
but
ideally
its
a
good
summer
quencher
highly
recommended
to
hop
heads
and
fans
of
apas
in
general
d
a
very
good
pale
ale
perhaps
my
favorite
that
ive
tried
thus
far
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
drinking
a
whole
bunch
is
availability
and
the
touch
of
lingering
bitternessdryness
almost
exceptional
p
d
i
cant
say
sessionable
considering
the
abv
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
one
that
ill
want
to
have
in
my
fridge
at
any
given
time
and
a
beer
that
i
feel
could
convert
some
bmc
drinkers
to
quality
craft
ale
in
a
can
nice
amber
color
with
short
creamy
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
citrus
and
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
its
somewhat
bitter
on
the
tongue
but
has
surprisingly
little
flavor
for
how
heavy
it
is
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
cant
say
id
buy
it
again
or
that
im
particularly
stoked
about
the
remaining
5
cans
maybe
my
opinion
will
change
after
a
couple
more
amber
color
shortlived
head
and
lacing
very
faint
smell
light
malt
and
bitter
hops
though
the
smell
is
very
weak
for
the
style
bitter
hops
dominate
the
taste
with
a
with
a
bit
of
lighter
malt
to
balance
it
out
but
the
taste
is
primarily
hoppy
and
a
very
nice
hop
taste
hop
taste
is
a
combination
of
moderate
carbonation
and
bitter
hops
both
combining
effects
while
remaining
smooth
and
drinkable
the
almost
overwhelming
hop
presence
without
having
a
strong
lasting
aftertaste
of
the
hops
allows
it
to
be
drinkable
although
not
as
much
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
a
bit
less
hoppy
great
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
hops
but
a
bit
onedimensional
otherwise
very
drinkable
not
too
exciting
but
its
still
one
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
d
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
hop
intensity
but
it
is
very
nicely
balanced
and
very
flavorful
overall
the
best
apa
that
i
have
ever
had
if
you
have
not
gotten
a
chance
to
have
dales
or
any
other
ob
then
you
need
to
seek
it
out
a
great
beer
for
cold
late
nights
hot
mountain
bike
rides
anything
easy
drinking
pale
a
bit
high
on
the
abv
to
session
but
still
good
stuff
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
drinkability
is
good
i
love
the
bitter
hops
out
of
a
can
this
is
a
great
beer
and
never
thought
i
would
be
able
to
taste
a
hoppy
beer
like
this
out
of
a
can
its
too
bad
i
live
in
louisiana
and
i
got
this
in
tx
i
would
drink
this
more
often
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
taste
is
like
it
smells
quite
a
hop
bomb
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
however
just
a
little
to
hoppy
for
my
taste
f
finishes
pretty
dry
and
plenty
bitter
lingering
spicy
hops
combine
with
a
slight
pine
and
citrus
as
well
as
some
earthy
chewy
hop
flavors
that
stick
around
for
a
while
the
bitterness
builds
a
bit
but
doesnt
get
overwhelming
overall
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
on
the
bitter
side
but
still
lighter
for
a
good
summer
drink
mouthdrink
mouth
is
decent
with
the
mild
carbonation
it
was
actually
kind
of
difficult
to
finish
the
whole
sixer
theres
something
a
bit
off
here
d
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
apa
that
is
not
watery
and
has
a
good
taste
balance
and
a
pretty
unnoticeable
alcohol
content
d
good
subdued
hops
wonderful
balance
and
a
great
malt
backdrop
this
is
certainly
a
sessionable
beer
just
watch
its
higher
6
5
abv
d
i
will
most
definitely
be
picking
more
of
these
up
overall
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
definitely
not
one
that
i
feel
is
a
top
five
i
would
drink
again
but
probably
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
if
there
was
slightly
less
bitterness
and
more
in
the
aroma
from
the
hops
this
one
could
be
great
a
really
nice
pale
ale
bordering
on
being
an
ipa
i
really
like
the
hop
combo
used
in
this
beer
very
juicy
while
still
bringing
the
bitterness
the
malt
profile
matched
beautifully
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
beer
that
does
a
lot
of
things
really
good
but
nothing
great
a
fine
example
of
a
pale
ale
that
id
gladly
have
again
availability
permitting
the
lack
of
aroma
is
the
biggest
issue
but
really
may
be
all
the
more
reason
to
enjoy
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
in
a
can
from
the
can
notes
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
one
and
crafts
cans
are
now
expanding
quite
a
bit
this
one
remains
iconic
in
that
regard
and
is
a
fairly
reliable
and
pleasing
apa
d
wow
its
amazing
how
the
taste
is
preserved
in
a
can
certainly
worth
saving
this
six
pack
of
cans
incredible
would
definitely
drink
again
great
beer
i
really
want
to
talk
abotu
it
but
i
dont
have
the
time
right
now
please
let
me
just
post
my
ratings
yes
overall
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
beer
in
a
can
at
least
so
far
as
far
as
flavor
and
smell
is
concerned
this
pale
ale
is
top
notch
deceptively
impressive
after
bypassing
its
loud
and
old
school
label
this
beer
is
of
high
quality
and
is
intended
for
slow
paced
day
drinking
when
ice
cold
another
fine
export
from
the
great
state
of
colorado
and
worth
a
try
whenever
stumbled
upon
in
random
bars
harder
to
find
then
youd
think
so
grab
it
while
you
can
this
is
an
all
time
favorite
for
those
looking
for
great
aroma
and
taste
from
classic
pale
ale
d
a
good
pale
ale
easily
drinkable
but
with
all
of
the
chatter
about
this
one
i
must
admit
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
it
would
have
certainly
appreciated
a
heavier
hop
nose
very
good
beer
in
all
worthwhile
session
alternative
d
it
does
not
drink
like
a
6
5
abv
beer
i
drank
a
few
while
working
in
the
yard
and
found
it
very
refreshing
d
great
session
beer
glad
to
finally
get
a
chance
to
review
it
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
here
a
nice
light
body
and
not
a
super
high
abv
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
go
to
beers
from
now
on
great
to
keep
around
the
house
and
doesnt
take
up
to
much
room
in
the
fridge
wow
a
great
ipa
in
a
can
i
love
the
versatility
and
the
simple
logo
i
think
us
bas
have
a
bit
of
a
complex
sometimes
we
never
have
fit
in
we
have
never
been
that
guy
who
could
bring
a
case
of
beer
to
a
party
and
sit
back
knowing
that
you
hold
something
awesome
in
your
hands
this
is
the
beer
that
can
allow
us
to
do
that
everywhere
bottles
cant
go
dales
pale
ale
is
there
for
us
i
can
never
possibly
think
about
having
another
adventurous
camping
trip
without
a
6
pack
of
dales
pale
ale
by
my
side
thank
you
dale
for
making
life
more
awesome
this
mediumbodied
brew
tastes
of
cereal
grains
with
a
fair
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
throughout
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
of
alcohol
pretty
easily
drinkable
tremendous
for
the
style
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
some
white
head
decent
retention
smells
largely
of
citrus
hops
with
some
caramel
backbone
as
well
tastes
like
a
classic
apa
reminds
me
of
a
better
sn
big
leafy
and
herbal
hops
on
top
of
a
pronounced
caramel
malt
backbone
a
baby
barleywine
here
to
some
degree
mf
is
medium
with
some
creaminessfullness
great
drinkability
an
archetype
of
session
beer
to
me
d
the
bite
keeps
it
from
being
higher
but
still
not
a
bad
choice
and
paired
well
with
habanero
cheetos
which
somehow
made
it
an
even
more
enjoyable
experience
i
bet
this
score
wont
come
out
like
i
want
it
to
i
really
really
love
this
beer
they
nail
it
on
the
taste
i
really
dont
care
that
much
about
how
it
looks
or
feels
in
my
mouth
this
stuff
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
clear
amber
yellow
with
a
thick
head
that
lingers
smells
pretty
hoppy
and
alcoholic
taste
is
similar
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
hops
its
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
ok
but
for
me
not
too
drinkable
im
not
a
hoppy
person
but
if
you
are
this
one
is
well
made
and
tasty
just
not
my
taste
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
in
a
can
makes
it
a
must
for
camping
and
outdoor
events
oskar
river
brewing
has
a
monopoly
on
my
cooler
when
i
hit
the
great
outdoors
d
awesome
you
can
drink
just
one
or
two
by
itself
with
a
meal
during
a
ski
trip
on
the
mountain
have
done
this
numerous
times
by
stowing
it
in
my
backpack
or
you
can
go
on
a
bender
and
drink
a
whole
bunch
value
pretty
decent
at
ten
bucks
a
sixer
dthis
is
extremely
drinkable
just
a
tad
too
much
bitterness
at
the
finish
to
be
perfectly
drinkable
for
a
pale
ale
the
hop
presence
is
fantastic
in
the
nose
and
slightly
lesser
in
the
taste
d
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
grab
my
fifth
slice
of
sicilian
pizza
notes
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
had
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
oskar
blues
this
has
amazing
appearance
and
awesome
drinkability
the
flavors
are
just
so
juicy
pours
a
deep
and
rich
burnt
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
retreats
quickly
the
nose
tingling
aromas
of
cirtus
and
pine
erupt
from
the
pour
wonderful
tingly
carbonation
is
a
great
accent
to
this
bold
apa
the
mouthfeel
is
substantive
in
that
there
are
no
watery
moments
and
similarly
there
is
no
slick
or
syrupy
aspect
to
the
drink
the
hop
bitterness
attacks
the
entire
tongue
and
pallet
leaving
no
taste
bud
untouched
i
have
an
affinity
for
canned
beers
that
pack
a
hop
punch
they
give
me
a
great
opportunity
to
drink
beer
for
breakfast
while
fishing
camping
etc
oskar
blues
does
a
great
job
on
this
brew
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
with
its
drinkability
ie
its
relatively
modest
abv
for
its
style
overall
i
didnt
think
this
gained
a
whole
lot
from
the
dryhopping
and
cask
conditioning
a
very
solid
beer
thats
worth
a
try
however
its
served
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
that
ive
had
so
far
anybody
that
enjoys
a
hoppy
beer
will
definitely
appreciate
this
one
oskar
blues
has
yet
to
let
me
down
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
brews
drinkability
this
is
in
no
way
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
too
aggressive
on
the
hops
and
soap
like
taste
they
bring
to
the
show
just
not
something
i
personally
would
be
willing
to
kill
a
whole
6pack
of
overall
i
loved
this
beer
i
would
rate
it
among
the
top
american
ales
i
have
tried
this
beer
is
growing
on
me
as
i
drink
it
i
am
liking
it
more
as
it
warms
slightly
the
citrus
and
fruit
flavors
show
a
little
more
decent
brew
d
flavor
makes
for
easy
drinking
as
does
the
abv
i
like
this
beer
very
much
and
think
it
makes
a
good
transition
beer
for
non
craft
beer
drinkers
clear
copper
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
citrus
peel
and
caramel
a
healthy
dose
of
caramel
malt
is
well
balanced
with
some
fresh
floral
hop
seasoning
and
candied
orange
rind
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
top
notch
apa
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
really
good
pale
ale
i
love
the
big
hop
aroma
and
flavor
combined
with
the
carmel
sweet
malt
i
could
easily
kill
several
of
these
i
have
loved
every
oskar
blues
beer
ive
had
and
they
have
made
their
way
into
my
top
3
favorite
breweries
recommended
if
you
like
pale
ales
with
an
ipa
feel
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
one
that
i
revisit
quite
often
another
solid
beer
from
oskar
blues
recommended
d
a
nice
apa
thats
a
little
on
the
hopheavy
side
but
still
quite
nice
its
interesting
to
drink
something
this
good
out
of
a
can
i
am
still
hesitant
to
try
it
in
a
can
based
on
some
of
the
other
reviews
that
i
have
read
calling
out
the
metallic
flavor
the
color
was
nice
and
copper
in
tone
the
head
was
a
bit
weak
and
soapy
aroma
had
some
nice
caramel
and
a
light
malty
toastiness
clean
taste
and
lively
with
carbonation
it
had
a
nice
hoppy
bite
to
it
im
happy
to
see
good
beers
being
packaged
in
cans
they
recycle
well
and
save
these
beer
from
destructive
uv
rays
just
shake
your
boots
and
let
it
all
get
loose
a
medium
body
this
one
goes
great
with
food
d
drinks
nicely
goes
great
with
the
pizza
im
eating
a
nice
lunchtime
brew
has
a
nice
brightcopper
color
and
a
loose
offwhite
head
that
bubbles
away
happily
and
quickly
a
decent
floral
nose
is
mellowed
by
strong
caramel
and
a
light
malty
toastiness
that
is
quite
appealing
very
clean
taste
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
hoppy
bite
that
is
pulled
along
by
strong
malts
dont
be
fooled
by
the
blather
on
the
can
this
is
definitely
not
a
voluminously
hopped
mutha
of
a
pale
ale
its
hoppy
but
within
reason
and
well
balanced
so
as
not
to
be
offensive
the
staff
at
oskar
have
clearly
been
reading
too
much
puffery
on
bottles
from
stone
and
rogue
well
worth
a
try
gives
canned
beer
a
good
name
d
this
is
a
nice
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
pale
i
would
love
for
this
to
be
locally
available
to
me
one
of
the
best
canned
beers
i
have
ever
had
definitely
will
try
this
again
if
i
get
a
chance
had
to
import
this
to
korea
but
was
well
worth
the
extra
shipping
costs
poured
it
into
a
wine
glass
and
it
gave
me
a
nice
lacing
and
approx
1
inch
of
foamy
heady
the
smell
is
great
a
little
fruity
and
hoppy
the
colour
is
a
coppery
hue
with
a
abv
of
6
5
you
can
certainly
enjoy
a
short
session
of
23
this
beer
was
surprisingly
hoppy
to
me
for
a
pale
ale
but
very
flavorful
and
pleasing
nonetheless
its
my
first
craft
beer
from
a
can
with
the
exception
of
a
couple
nitrocan
stouts
i
didnt
have
lower
expectations
because
of
it
and
was
looking
forward
to
see
if
it
made
a
difference
none
that
i
could
see
give
this
one
a
shot
the
feel
of
this
beer
light
to
medium
with
some
carbonation
that
is
pretty
light
it
also
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
smooth
even
if
it
is
pretty
hoppy
d
this
is
a
session
beer
just
a
great
all
around
apa
i
could
drink
this
everyday
unlike
many
other
heavier
beers
however
this
is
no
macrobrewery
drink
it
has
complex
undertones
to
the
taste
that
make
everything
come
together
has
anyone
ever
asked
you
if
you
could
only
drink
one
beer
the
rest
of
your
life
what
would
it
be
me
and
my
fellow
liquor
store
employees
have
found
ourselves
talking
about
things
you
cant
even
imagine
and
not
surprisingly
this
question
has
been
brought
up
on
first
reaction
you
would
shout
out
some
world
class
beer
like
founders
kentucky
breakfast
stout
or
fffs
dark
lord
but
all
the
time
for
the
rest
of
my
life
those
are
desserts
and
should
be
treated
as
such
i
think
my
answer
would
be
a
benchmark
ipa
like
founders
centennial
or
dogfish
90
minute
but
when
this
beauty
appeared
in
a
thank
you
four
pack
i
received
for
covering
a
shift
an
eyebrow
was
definitely
skewed
i
brushed
it
off
as
just
a
funny
beer
with
a
funny
name
like
horse
piss
for
petes
sake
its
in
a
can
ahh
but
thats
part
of
the
beauty
my
friend
now
that
this
ham
in
a
can
has
been
discovered
i
wouldnt
recommend
camping
without
it
i
have
a
friend
from
pennsylvania
who
i
have
running
this
stuff
across
the
border
like
its
shwill
this
is
my
desert
island
beer
try
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
almost
could
make
this
my
session
beer
but
sadly
i
cant
get
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
everyone
who
wants
to
know
what
a
great
pale
ale
tastes
like
d
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
a
nice
option
for
the
golf
course
that
does
not
allow
bottles
oskar
blues
dales
pale
ale
is
a
cloudy
light
amber
ale
with
a
soft
fluffy
yellowwhite
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
huge
hoppy
aroma
thats
floral
and
grassy
a
little
sweet
with
a
note
of
lemon
or
lemongrass
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
crisp
finish
he
hops
leave
the
tongue
a
little
scratchy
heres
prenty
of
bitter
fruity
grassy
hop
flavor
theres
a
peppery
alcohol
flavor
at
the
finish
its
on
the
powerful
end
of
the
session
ale
spectrum
if
i
wouldve
tasted
this
ten
years
ago
i
wouldve
called
it
an
ipa
from
notesfairly
clear
amberorange
color
however
it
wasnt
until
my
second
that
i
actually
poured
into
a
glass
it
was
quite
an
experience
to
pull
the
tab
on
a
can
and
be
greeted
with
that
citrus
hops
with
a
hint
of
pine
theres
also
some
bready
malts
taste
is
quite
comparable
to
the
scent
really
well
balanced
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
still
have
to
put
burning
river
at
the
top
i
tend
to
like
the
hop
forward
versions
so
that
appeals
to
me
with
this
beer
i
just
cant
get
over
the
oddity
of
a
canned
beer
tasting
so
good
first
impression
from
tasting
is
how
full
and
fluffy
it
feels
not
much
in
carbonation
but
still
very
lively
nice
sweet
mix
of
a
peppery
hop
bite
and
honey
in
the
flavor
upfront
the
malt
backbone
takes
the
bite
off
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
pulling
the
brew
together
for
a
warming
feeling
and
a
mellow
somewhat
wood
aged
spice
drinkability
this
is
a
wellmade
drinkable
beer
that
ill
be
having
more
of
in
the
future
a
crisp
golden
orange
color
pours
out
of
the
can
while
a
pearly
white
head
develops
into
a
nice
1
inch
topping
one
sip
and
lacing
is
already
beginning
the
head
is
quite
frothy
for
an
apa
grapefruit
and
lemon
are
prevalent
on
the
nose
with
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
considering
how
it
is
full
of
taste
and
not
overly
expensive
taste
is
rich
and
tangy
with
a
nice
bitterness
from
the
hops
very
citrusy
and
full
of
grapefruit
the
bitterness
sits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
the
citrus
dances
around
the
front
the
hint
of
malts
gets
this
beer
down
quite
smoothly
very
delicious
nice
mouthfeel
on
this
apa
as
well
nice
and
crisp
has
a
smooth
backbone
as
well
that
settles
down
the
crispness
from
carbonation
goes
down
easy
provides
huge
amounts
of
aromas
and
tastes
great
beer
all
in
all
and
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
is
the
new
go
to
for
hoppy
beers
that
are
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
similar
to
sn
torpedo
great
with
wings
i
bet
and
spicy
foods
and
love
the
can
presentation
md
crisp
light
medium
body
with
excellent
carbonation
not
too
dry
and
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
would
be
fantastic
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
just
as
delicious
in
the
dead
of
winter
amber
body
with
a
creamy
caramel
head
nice
clumpy
ringlets
of
lace
are
left
as
the
head
shrinks
multi
grain
sweet
bread
caramel
coated
green
apples
and
nice
hop
presence
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
but
not
great
spruce
and
pine
character
like
frsh
cut
tree
limbs
bitter
pale
malt
and
light
pink
under
ripened
grapefruit
with
dried
orange
peel
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
sudsy
rolls
over
the
tongue
nicely
dry
but
not
over
done
not
as
good
as
hoped
for
but
better
than
average
d
a
pretty
big
pale
ale
daddy
like
very
drinkable
im
ready
for
sessions
gonna
pop
me
another
can
now
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
if
your
can
wasnt
adjatated
like
mine
is
the
smell
this
beer
smells
like
hoppy
taste
is
extremely
hoppy
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
foamy
with
a
metalic
bite
from
the
can
i
have
to
admit
it
is
a
pleasent
taste
would
drink
again
i
have
tried
this
several
times
and
rarely
found
one
that
didnt
taste
exactly
like
the
can
it
was
poured
from
an
ipa
is
my
favorite
beer
and
i
see
promise
in
this
one
but
they
need
to
bottle
it
vice
the
can
that
is
how
this
beer
has
to
acquire
the
metallic
taste
otherwise
it
has
a
future
this
really
is
a
session
beer
for
a
hophead
like
me
one
time
i
looked
down
after
a
night
of
hanging
out
and
was
quite
surprised
to
see
5
or
6
empty
cans
in
front
of
me
not
even
my
favorite
oskar
blues
brew
gordon
is
top
notch
but
a
solid
choice
typical
hopdriven
pale
ale
but
nothing
too
special
12
oz
can
to
glass
copper
color
a
bit
darker
than
what
ive
seen
for
this
style
nose
was
good
fresh
hop
smell
pretty
mellow
flavors
nothing
too
crazy
or
exciting
in
either
malt
or
hops
overall
decent
wellmade
but
not
sure
id
recommend
this
the
best
beer
i
think
ive
ever
had
a
dark
golden
color
with
an
ambitious
head
for
a
pale
ale
it
carries
a
prominent
chop
aroma
the
taste
delivers
that
hoppy
flavor
but
it
is
followed
immediately
with
a
sweet
finish
that
perfectly
balances
it
delicious
m
this
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
no
alcohol
or
fizz
d
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
other
than
a
bitterness
good
pale
ale
has
some
unique
characteristics
compared
to
others
but
all
work
well
together
not
a
favorite
of
mine
for
the
style
but
good
for
something
a
little
different
but
still
in
the
same
style
at
its
core
overpriced
but
worth
a
try
without
a
doubt
overall
a
standardbearer
for
hopheads
not
offthewall
but
a
good
tasting
pale
comes
off
very
similar
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
and
thats
a
damn
good
thing
this
another
great
example
of
very
good
beer
that
comes
in
a
can
i
really
look
forward
to
the
days
when
craftbrewers
line
oskar
blues
start
spending
more
on
their
ingredients
and
less
on
bottles
and
shipping
i
hope
its
not
too
far
away
d
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
not
overly
hoppy
nor
malty
but
a
good
balance
of
the
two
i
avoided
this
beer
for
a
long
time
soley
because
it
was
in
a
can
i
am
now
ashamed
of
myself
this
so
far
the
best
american
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
will
base
all
apas
in
the
future
on
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
day
everyday
good
flavor
and
crispness
makes
this
a
good
all
around
beer
for
the
beer
aficionado
or
a
first
time
craft
drinker
overall
decent
not
something
i
would
go
nuts
about
overall
very
good
on
draft
ill
be
filling
up
my
growler
with
this
as
long
as
its
around
seeing
as
six
packs
are
approaching
910
dollars
anyway
for
the
good
stuff
you
may
as
well
find
somewhere
to
fill
your
jug
up
910
dollars
for
about
5
pints
of
a
good
draft
beer
such
as
this
is
a
deal
and
a
half
im
intrigued
how
it
translates
in
the
can
if
you
are
camping
somewhere
and
glass
bottles
are
prohibited
this
is
the
perfect
choice
d
good
apa
very
sessionable
and
the
cans
are
easy
to
work
with
as
opposed
to
bottles
proof
that
good
beer
can
be
in
a
can
d
like
i
said
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
its
got
a
dry
bitter
kick
to
the
finish
that
lowers
its
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
its
a
wellcrafted
and
balanced
pale
im
also
happy
for
the
sunblocking
can
it
comes
in
d
very
nice
sessionable
beer
mmm
very
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
almost
an
ipa
for
an
apa
but
very
fresh
and
tasty
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
in
a
while
a
refreshing
take
on
a
regular
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
and
refreshing
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
would
be
a
possibility
for
a
session
beer
but
can
be
a
little
pricey
compared
to
others
but
overall
quite
nice
the
can
says
something
about
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
no
lie
i
just
dont
care
for
the
kind
of
hops
used
the
aroma
is
of
a
pine
forest
and
the
taste
is
exactly
the
same
chewing
on
pine
needles
as
a
pale
ale
i
think
it
is
to
hoppy
i
wouldnt
enjoy
more
than
one
found
two
six
packs
at
the
grocery
store
so
glad
i
did
appearace
is
dark
orange
copper
amber
a
little
cloudy
looks
and
smells
like
an
ipa
nice
two
inch
head
beutiful
lacing
the
look
is
kind
of
a
moot
point
because
this
will
be
consumed
directly
from
the
can
harsh
hop
presance
in
a
good
way
this
has
to
be
very
close
to
an
ipa
juicy
oily
hops
bludgen
your
tounge
i
love
this
beer
it
has
even
more
hoppy
goodness
than
stone
or
sierra
nevadas
versions
more
of
a
creamy
complex
mouth
feel
too
at
close
to
7
abv
it
is
almost
too
drinkable
i
just
love
how
it
tastes
i
really
love
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
cool
red
and
blue
redneck
looking
can
i
love
cans
up
there
with
my
favorites
great
beer
drinkability
i
wish
this
was
something
that
i
could
get
my
hands
on
all
the
time
the
smell
and
taste
are
great
and
its
very
refreshing
this
would
definitely
be
a
goto
pale
for
me
da
good
apa
very
easy
drinking
i
would
readily
drink
this
again
this
would
make
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
the
deep
orange
color
is
always
darker
than
i
expect
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
complex
with
a
combination
of
caramel
sweetness
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
much
more
onedimensional
with
the
hops
driving
the
party
the
flavor
is
bigger
and
bitterer
than
many
pale
ales
with
strong
notes
of
pine
and
grapefruit
the
bitterness
builds
which
can
make
it
tough
to
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
i
learned
this
when
i
chose
dales
as
my
preferred
can
to
drink
on
the
beach
this
summer
overall
very
flavorful
and
a
great
option
among
canned
beers
but
not
one
of
the
first
pale
ales
i
would
reach
for
draught
at
pizzeria
paradiso
in
dupont
circle
clear
amber
with
a
medium
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
black
pepper
and
lemon
flavor
is
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
subtle
hoppy
bitterness
and
the
malt
not
over
the
tops
as
some
american
ipas
are
nicely
done
d
drinkable
and
interesting
md
perfect
carbonation
on
this
beer
helps
give
it
a
frothy
mouth
and
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
better
pales
ive
had
this
beer
is
light
enough
to
request
more
than
a
12
oz
but
not
so
light
that
you
think
you
are
drinking
water
i
could
easily
drink
a
12
pack
without
knowing
it
drinkability
a
little
strong
for
your
sessionable
pale
alebut
plenty
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
i
like
this
beer
overall
a
great
pale
ale
with
a
good
malt
character
and
strong
hops
flavor
without
overpowering
the
balance
dales
pale
ale
is
very
drinkable
with
an
assertive
hop
character
this
is
definitely
a
good
pale
ale
to
have
around
even
though
it
can
be
somewhat
pricier
than
other
pale
ales
that
i
would
consider
to
be
of
more
or
less
comparable
quality
at
any
rate
this
is
a
good
option
when
i
want
to
switch
things
up
feel
and
drinkability
this
one
as
aforementioned
is
soft
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
soft
and
delicate
not
prickly
the
beer
goes
down
real
smooth
body
is
full
and
the
flavor
just
lingersmalt
gives
way
to
hops
and
they
just
sit
there
on
the
palate
the
next
sip
is
perfectly
balanced
sweetness
hits
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
youve
still
got
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
there
from
the
previous
sip
excellent
beer
be
sure
to
buy
this
if
you
find
it
drinkability
it
has
the
flavor
to
make
me
want
more
and
is
not
too
heavy
or
overpowering
to
put
me
off
i
really
enjoyed
this
pale
ale
d
a
decent
pa
but
not
a
standout
food
pairings
poultry
good
with
earthy
nutty
and
tangy
cheeses
also
salads
that
have
nuts
and
a
citrusy
dressing
in
them
d
nice
pale
ale
that
is
very
much
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
or
to
pair
with
typical
american
pub
fare
d
fantasticly
sessionable
pale
ale
that
is
a
staple
buy
when
i
go
to
a
market
its
sold
in
top
notch
beer
pours
a
pretty
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
1
5
finger
head
that
is
decently
creamy
but
resides
fairly
quickly
nice
thick
lacing
is
left
as
i
drink
this
one
down
smells
mostly
malty
to
me
with
a
hop
piney
backbone
a
decent
balance
but
i
pick
up
mostly
pale
malts
the
smell
is
certainly
deceiving
to
the
taste
it
is
a
bit
weak
not
much
going
on
i
guess
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
a
huge
kick
of
malts
to
start
off
perfectly
balanced
by
a
blast
of
hops
in
the
after
taste
i
feel
like
there
is
only
one
hop
used
here
and
lots
of
it
it
kicks
you
in
the
mouth
in
the
aftertaste
the
can
is
not
lying
about
it
being
hoppy
some
sweetness
can
be
detected
on
the
palatte
asides
from
the
malts
a
good
kind
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
creamyness
and
a
huge
coat
of
hops
left
on
the
tongue
no
alcohol
taste
but
a
tiny
bit
of
warming
in
this
one
drinkability
is
good
here
good
taste
and
the
price
for
it
is
not
bad
the
only
thing
i
am
worried
about
is
the
hop
backbone
overtaking
the
palette
if
i
have
a
few
of
these
other
than
that
no
off
flavors
or
over
alcohol
will
kill
this
one
maybe
ill
buy
this
one
if
i
want
an
overly
hopped
pale
ale
for
a
decent
price
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
made
more
portable
by
being
in
a
can
i
can
now
say
that
have
gotten
over
the
stigma
of
a
craft
beer
being
in
a
can

taste
at
first
is

with
some

then
a
bitterness
creeps
up
that
reminds
me
of
biting
into
an

biscuity
finish

for

find
it
a

harsh
without
a

there
to
balance
it
out
quite
malty
for
an
american
pale
medium
bodied
with
a
comparatively
high
carbonation
decent
stuff
though
i
am
fairly
surprised
that
this
has
so
much
bitterness
without
an
equal

also
at
how
malty

one

there

the
aroma

flavor

hit

though
its
definitely
hoppy

a
pale

a
very

its
a
satisfying

drinkable
beer
im
trying
it

and
definitely
prefer
this
beer
excellent
stuff
i
like
the
cans
j
d
on

i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
maybe
even
more
so
than
out
of
the
can
d
drinkable
beer
and
also
amazing
coming
from
a
can
not
the
best
but
a
good
beer
to
have
around
nicely
drinkable
well
balanced
flavorful
though
a
bit
brash
for
an
apa
in
my
eyes
i
would
certainly
take
one
without
hesitating
but
its
just
bigger
than
most
apas
ive
had
and
that
can
be
good
and
bad
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
above
average
but
not
over
the
top
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
a
little
to
malty
for
the
style
i
much
prefer
a
lighter
body
and
stronger
hop
profile
in
my
pale
ales
skal
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
if
not
my
favorite
pale
ales
simply
put
i
had
a
craving
for
this
beer
this
week
the
six
pack
i
bought
though
nearly
10
50
and
a
bit
dated
at
nearly
3
plus
months
didnt
disappoint
is
it
the
can
or
kudos
to
my
local
shop
for
keeping
it
refrigerated
anyway
an
aggressive
pour
leaves
a
two
finger
head
that
leaves
satisfying
amounts
of
lace
by
the
third
pint
the
malt
is
caramel
and
sweet
but
the
hop
profile
is
where
this
beer
just
shines
it
is
balanced
the
almost
brown
sugar
malt
base
is
perfectly
matched
with
the
tangy
citrusy
hoppiness
disappears
dangerously
fast
from
my
standard
pint

is

with
some
decent

down

it
smells

taste
is
just
that
it
starts
with
a

roasted

taste
and
then
finishes
with
the
citrisy

floral
hops
the
balance
of
those

is
pretty
good

not
the
best
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
not

carbonated

its
in

quite
malty

grapefruity
hops
a
small
bitter
in

this
beer
has
a
drying
effect
in

which
to
a

is
nice
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
wonderful

act

the
pine
and
floral
balanced
with
a
solid
malt
base

had
this
beer
on
a
nonhyped
recomendation
of
a
liquor
store
owner
on
my
visit
to
the
carolinas
id
never
even
heard
of
it
before
then
so
with
a
nice
balance
of
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
bonus
points
for
using
updated
can
technology
to
enhance
freshness
and
portability
i
have
purchased
a
case
and
a
half
of
this
stuff
because
it
flies
off
the
shelves
at
my
local
store
noticed
some
consistency
variations
between
canned
batches
but
that
is
not
enough
to
save
the
production
its
whats
in

with

a
bit
of

taste
is
my
only
complaint
other
tha
that
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
great
on
its

utterly
unbelievable
for
a

it
above

opinion

my

in

grapefruit
and
pineapple
as
well
as
hints
at
some

freshness
this
was
balanced
out
very
nicely
with
hints
at
grain

flavors
i
actually
detected
a

of

away

this

could
see
myself
easily
drinking
a
few
of
these
hoppy
and
flavorful
citrus
this
is
the
ideal

the
balance
between
the

character
was
spot
on
for
my
preference
the
use
of
munich
made
it
interesting
and
the
firm
bitterness
is
something
i
dont
usually
find
in
the

category
a
wellhopped
citric
delight
packs
a

of
flavor
for
a
low

a
really
nice
surprise
i
really
enjoyed
it
founders
all
day
used
to
be
my
session
beer
but
boat
kills
it
in
every
way
imaginable
it
has
the
crisp
bite
of
all
day
but
while
ad
kind
of
falls
off
after
the
initial
flavor
boat
finishes
so
clean
youll
swear
youre
drinking
a
much
higher
abv
brew
simply
outstanding
offering
from
carton
the
taste
iis
tangy
with
lemony
hop
element
and
subtle
acicidty
in

taste
with

citrus
golden
grapefruitlike
punch
with
somewhat
herbal
hop
quality
and
grassy
aspect
with
a
light
astringency
level
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
better
than
most
beers
of
this
style
but
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
a
bit
too
assertive
bitterness

for
the

pushed
to

the

throughout
just
great
clean

and
crushable
get
it
drink
it
and
then
drink
more
another
great
offering
from
carton
nice
session
apa
not
bursting
with
nose
or
taste
but
you
can
only
expect
so
much
from
this
style
very
drinkable
good
carbonation
refreshing
overall
nice
session
im
not
a
boat
person
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
dry
land
too
overall
pretty
good
stuff
kind
of
straddles
the
line
between
a
pale
ale
and
session
ipa
so
if
that
sounds
like
youre
thing
then
you
should
check
this
one
out
along
with
new
glarus
spotted
cow
a
goto
for
a
sessionable
beer
definite
bonus
for
the
pounder
cans
doesnt
smell
like
much
doesnt
taste
like
much
i
guess
its
okay
if
you
want
something
sort
of
watery
on
a
hot
day
but
theres
much
more
flavorful
beers
to
be
had
in
the
session
beer
arena
the
body
was
just
a
bit
on
the
light
side
of
medium
which
would
be
a
good
thing
for
an
allday
drinker
of
a
beer
drinkability
was
excellent
the
beer
was
gone
far
too
quickly
leaving
me
wanting
more
overall
a
very
fine
beer
a
must
try
and
one
worthy
of
repeated
drinks
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
from
a
session
beer
incredibly
flavorful
o
though
it
has
me
wanting
more
overall
flavor
just
like
with
other
session
ipas
this
one
certainly
beats
out
most
of
the
others
ive
had
if
i
lived
in
nj
i
would
happily
buy
this
for
any
outdoor
activity
definitely
a
cool
beer
full
and
flavorful
oa
good
easy
drinking
session
ale
loved
this
beer
super
easy
to
drink
with
a
ton
of
flavor
but
balanced
i
will
be
all
over
this
one
again
o
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
from
carton
this
is
a
local
brewery
for
me
and
proud
that
it
comes
from
nj
very
well
balanced
beer
and
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
great
flavors
overall
this
beer
is
total
genius
light
but
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
extremely
refreshing
and
would
pair
well
with
a
ton
of
foods
fantastic
anytime
but
especially
in
the
warm
weather
aroma
was
great
but
in
the
end
the
beer
drinks
a
bit
unbalanced
with
the
heavy
bitterness
and
lack
of
malt
backbone
though
i
dont
dislike
it
a
very
firm
session
ale
3

o
fantastic
powerful
flavor
profile
relative
to
the
body
this
is
a
great
session
if
you
want
something
with
big
flavor

overall
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
i
like
boating
and
i
can
now
confirm
that
i
like
cartons
boat
beer
next
i
gotta
drink
this
beer
out
on
the
fishing
boat
on
a
hot
day
love
that
this
beer
is
canned
carlton
makes
a
good
beer
its
a
little
hoppier
than
i
would
have
expected
a
session
beer
to
be
but
its
not
overly
bitter
no
complaints
here
with
a
beer
that
has
35
ibus
o
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
not
a
lot
going
on
flavorwise
an
outstanding
session
that
drank
even
better
on
the
cape
may
beach
its
very
refreshing
the
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
southern
tier
live
or
bitter
american
a
very
light
malt
pale
ale
with
tons
of
citrus
hops
this
is
one
of
the
most
wellcrafted
beers
ive
ever
had
its
the
perfect
combination
of
powerful
flavor
with
a
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
carton
brewing
nailed
this
one
perfect
summer
session
ale
prefer
it
to
monkey
chased
the
weasel
cans
but
both
are
delicious
cant
wait
to
try
cartons
077xx
dipa
overall
another
well
done
session
brew
that
fits
summertime
i
could
have
used
a
touch
of
brighter
hops
on
the
taste
but
everything
else
was
top
notch
a
really
well
executed
beer
o
a
nice
example
of
a
session
ipa
emphasizing
the
aroma
and
bitterness
more
than
the
malt
i
like
it
i
had
it
the
next
day
while
writing
this
review
sidebyside
with
a
fat
heads
sunshine
daydream
which
i
liked
more
but
it
is
4
9
abv
and
this
is
4
2
abv
so
its
not
a
headtohead
comparison
id
say
in
this
abv
range
and
session
ipa
style
it
competes
well
with
the
best
of
them
can
from
trade
as
an
extra
thanks

is
light
pale

with
a
nice

some

some
juiciness
pretty

ther
german
influence
is
definitely
there
and
it
is
almost

hopped
up

extremely
clean

truly
dig
this
beer
you
will
too
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
your
hands
on
some
o
its
different
from
a
session
ipa
it
has
unique
flavors
a
slight
german
influence
lots
of
bitterness
and
a
tart
note
drinkability
is
very
good
o
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
summer
go
to
for
me
the
malt
bill
mouthfeel
and
bright
hop
character
come
together
perfectly
to
create
an
amazing
session
brew
well
done
overall
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
pushed
the
boundaries
of
a
pale
ale
just
a
little
bit
and
in
a
good
way
some
grassiness
which
i
often
find
to
be
bad
works
for
this
beer
first
brew
ive
tried
from
carton
and
im
impressed
hope
to
see
cans
available
in
my
area
very
well
done
brew
easy
to
drink
but
still
robust
in
flavor
and
aroma
as
far
as
session
ipas
go
this
is
tiptops
on
par
with
stone
go
to
i
was
sad
when
it
was
gone
poured
half
the
tall
boy
in
a
nonic
pint
and
drank
the
other
half
from
the
can
before
cracking
this
open
i
had
been
drinking
a
couple
of
mos
and
was
thinking
this
session
ale
wouldnt
stand
up
oh
my
buddha
was
i
wrong
this
is
the
most
flavorful
and
aromatic
table
brew
ive
ever
had
im
so
taken
back
by
how
flavorful
this
is
i
cant
write
a
proper
review
sorry
founders
all
day
your
spot
in
my
fridge
is
reserved
for
this
jersey
girl
overall
a
tasty
über
hoppy
session
ipa
o
excellent
session
ale
i
was
so
stoked
when
i
seen
this
was
on
the
board
at
ho1kb
legit
stuff
boat
simple
as
it
gets
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
tall
boy
i
get
a
grapefruit
hop
waft
almost
west
coastlike
but
wait
this
is
east
coast
pours
to
a
bright
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
good
semi
bitter
hoppiness
right
off
the
bat
very
similar
in
taste
to
an
esb
taste
continues
with
a
balanced
middle
then
a
semi
bitter
aftertaste
not
a
bad
brew
simple
as
the
name
states
potentially
a
session
brew
as
well
as
it
packs
good
flavor
for
a
4
2
ac
for
what
it
is
it
is
decent
and
not
at
all
offensive
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
at
times
it
feels
a
little
watery
but
its
to
be
expected
i
suppose
overall
easy
drinking
and
something
i
could
effortlessly
put
down
as
it
gets
warmer
out
odi
have
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
it
did
not
disappoint
i
wish
it
was
distributed
in
my
area
because
i
would
buy
these
all
the
time
o
overall
a
crazy
amount
of
aroma
flavor
hops
and
malt
depth
for
a
4
2abv
beer
that
only
claims
35ibus
which
drinks
light
years
beyond
the
alcohol
feels
alot
bigger
in
perception
the
hops
are
potent
american
citrus
flowery
hops
advertised
as
a
session
ipa
labeld
a
apa
this
brings
a
ton
of
respect
for
the
session
5abv
then
most
beers
much
bigger
the
bitterness
and
flavor
aspect
is
very
strong
and
good
seemingly
getting
stronger
as
the
drink
goes
on
kegcase
worthy
a
session
that
drinks
like
a
strongly
hopped
ipa
if
this
is
a
session
then
im
sold
small
bubbly
head
fades
rather
quickly

is
very
dry

with
accents
of

bitter
dry

mostly
dry

a
strong
bitter
grapefruit
with
a
long
bitter
and
dry
finish
malts
are
cracker
and
white
bread
perfectly
in
the
background
the
beer
is
super
light
and
so
easy
to
drink
the
bitter
aftertaste
gives
heft
to
the
beer
its
really
nice
just
so
easy
to
put
down
ointeresting
beer
good
flavors
that
have
some
suggestion
of
a
kolsch
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
really
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
is
the
can
i
would
have
never
bought
it
without
trishs
recommendation
id
be
interested
to
see
how
other
folks
feel
about
this
particular
brew
visit
the
carton
brewery
when
near
07716
poured
a
little
into
a
glass
just
to
see
the
bod
pours
a
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
white
film
of
head
smells
of
moss
grapefruit
mild
sweet
honey
tastes
of
grapefruit
wet
grass
hop
bitterness
jumps
in
and
beats
up
the
palate
and
the
beer
finished
mostly
clean
with
light
sweetness
lingering
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
great
easydrinking
beer
a
goto
for
all
occasions
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
love
it
and
i
think
most
who
try
it
would
i
however
am
unsure
if
it
supports
the
price
i
will
have
to
evaluate
further
and
compare
to
similar
brews
this
is
by
far
the
hoppiest
apa
ive
had
16oz

dissipates

tropical

evident
off

in

theres
a
hint
of

followed
by
a
slight

some

the

off

not

overall
a
great
session
apa
although
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
on

a

is
that

a

fizzy

very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
enjoying
a
few
i
like
the
move
by
some
breweries
to
offer
lower
alcohol
beers
that
are
full
on
flavor
but
they
can
be
difficult
to
make
with
less
to
hide
behind
hazy
goldenyellow
pour
with
a
small
bubbly

that
fizzled
down

pretty
surprising
blast
of
hops
in
the

citrusy
piney
crisp
for
a
4
2
brew
this
really
had
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
hop
profile
almost
pushed
it
into
ipa
territory
imo
citrus
pith
lemon
and
orange
pine
needles
floral
notes
crisp
bitterness
that
didnt
turn
foul
in
the
aftertaste
body
was
lightmedium
mouthfeel
was
snappy
and
dry
carbonation
was
moderate
simple
and
flavorful
i
could
see
this
being
an
everyday
beer
medium
body
wih
tight
carbonation
and
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
that
lingers
over
the
pale
malts
into
a
dry
finish
bitter
and
spicy
with
grassy
hops
and
pine
needle
along
with
pepper
and
corianders
this
is
countered
by
a
pale
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
bread
yeast
biscuit
and
light
fruit
kind
of
tame
and
flavors
seem
a
bit
off
to
me
feels
more
like
a
belgian
goldenpale
ale
with
zesty
spice
and
bland
hop
character
a
lot
of
people
whos
palates
i
trust
really
like
this
beer
so
id
like
to
give
it
another
try
at
some
point
but
my
first
impression
isnt
a
very
good
one
it
has
a
hoppy
grapefruit
aroma
it
has
a
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
blast
of
hops
going
down
your
throat
just
a
great
overall
beer
overall
a
fantastic
pale
ale
in
its
own
right
especially
if
you
like
your
pale
ales
on
the
juicy
citrusy
side
when
you
factor
in
that
its
only
4
2
abv
it
becomes
even
betterboat
beer
is
a
fitting
name
because
this
seems
like
the
perfect
beer
to
bring
out
on
the
boat
to
relax
o
if
this
were
more
readily
available
it
would
be
my
go
to
session
ale
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
popular
all
day
ipa
from
founders
with
the
cult
following
kane
has
in
nj
carton
deserves
almost
as
much
love
as
they
are
not
too
far
behind
incredible
beer
ive
always
been
one
for
the
american
pale
ale
and
now
their
is
a
suitable
replacement
to
my
lifetime
love
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
at
first
it
looks
like
a
cloudy
golden
bluemoonish
swill
but
my
mind
is
completely
switched
away
from
the
look
of
the
beer
centimeters
before
i
press
the
glass
against
my
lips
the
aroma
punches
your
nostrils
with
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
completely
refreshing
and
hoppy
im
just
happy
to
have
this
at
my
local
watering
hole
rerated
this
beer
is
amazing
period
this
past
month
they
made
that
happen
with
their
boat
beer
i
always
enjoyed
boat
beer
but
it
was
never
my
first
pick
i
would
always
go
home
with
a
sally
of
something
else
never
the
less
i
was
really
excited
to
purchase
my
two
case
limit
and
get
to
drinking
so
glad
i
did
boat
out
of
a
can
is
simply
amazing
it
has
become
my
favorite
beer
hands
down
i
wouldnt
just
be
saying
that
i
have
a
steady
supply
of
heady
topper
but
this
takes
the
cake
boat
is
king
the
cans
themselves
are
really
awesome
as
well
when
they
are
available
dont
hesitate
head
over
and
grab
them
but
expect
to
be
standing
in
line
right
behind
me
i
have
had
many
session
beers
and
one
that
blows
me
away
every
time
is
boat
it
gives
you
strong
ipa
flavor
that
keeps
you
coming
back
pint
after
pint
or
in
my
case
can
after
can
a
must
try
and
rivals
some
of
the
best
like
day
time
from
lagunitas
and
all
day
from
founders
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
probably
the
best
in
jersey
once
they
start
canning
and
growing
a
bit
watch
out
world
o
enjoyable
id
certainly
order
this
again
without
hesitation
a
super
tasty
beer
for
being
such
a
low
abv
still
has
great
hoppyness
and
it
is
super
crisp
one
of
my
new
favorite
summer
session
beers
the
smell
is
great
it
has
this
very
aromatic
quality
to
it
carton
has
made
another

overall
a
nice
session
ipa
very
refreshing
o
overall
the
flavors
and
smells
of
this
beer
intensify
as
it
warms
up
there
is
a
really
pleasant
hop
profile
to
this
beer
that
i
find
really
enjoyable
this
one
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
i
will
be
gladly
having
it
again
the
next
time
i
come
across
it
this
one
was
served
in
a
chilled
dos
equis
pint
glass
at
the
firewaters
in
the
basement
of
the
tropicana
on
the
ac
boardwalk
not
exactly
the
most
optimal
verssel
in
which
to
present
this
beer
but
despite
this
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
it
is
lighter
in
complexion
than
most
ipas
but
it
comes
off
with
a
most
agreeable
citrusy
mouthfeel
a
solid
white
head
maintains
throughout
sippery
an
exceptional
hop
profile
lingers
after
every
sip
a
very
good
beer
nice
to
find
in
such
a
beer
wasteland
asatlantic
city
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
session
beer
nicely
hopped
without
hitting
you
over
the
head
just
plain
smooth
and
easy
to
put
back
while
delivering
that
hop
punch
you
seek
this
is
a
unique
and
refreshing
beer
and
my
first
from
carton
brewing
thumbs
up
for
creativity
and
following
through
in
executing
a
fullbodied
sessionable
beer
eager
to
try
more
from
them
overall
the
low
abv
makes
this
the
most
poundable
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
close
to
kane
overhead
in
that
regard
m
mouth
puckering
hoppy
goodness
with
you
wanting
nothing
more
than
another
sip
and
with
a
modest
abv
of
4
4
go
ahead
and
have
some
more
this
is
without
question
my
favorite
session
beer
aroma
and
flavor
is
will
make
anyone
a
fan
of
hoppy
citrusforward
beers
seek
this
one
out
very
well
done
o
this
is
extremely
flavorful
for
such
a
lightbodied
beer
if
you
like
lots
of
hop
flavors
it
could
be
sessionable
given
the
low
alcohol
content
first
sip
surprisingly
choppy
thought
it
was
an
ipa
before
i
read
sstyle
here
citrus
flavor
dominates
and
this
finishes
extremely
dry
a
very
nice
surprise
but
dont
think
it
matches
apartment
style
good
beer
nonetheless
a
tasty
easy
drinking
sessionable
pale
ale
grab
a
growler
for
a
hot
summer
day
cheers
o
i
love
this
stuff
easily
the
best
session
ipa
session
pale
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
that
ive
ever
had
go
to
is
pretty
damn
good
too
but
i
think
the
sweetness
of
it
almost
gets
in
the
way
of
things
boat
is
simple
not
too
hoppy
where
you
get
worn
out
but
hoppy
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
over
a
session
great
beer
appearance
is
yellow
slightly
orange
with
a
bright
white
head
its
nose
is
pine
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
of
the
boat
ale
is
easy
sweet
a
good
dose
of
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
first
time
trying
anything
from
carton
a
pretty
good
beer
o
overall
my
second
beer
from
carton
and
another
winner
a
very
hoppy
but
easy
to
drink
apa
bordering
ipa
and
lots
of
nice
citrus
hops
and
orange
while
i
think
i
prefer
077xx
to
this
this
might
be
a
little
easier
to
have
a
few
of
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
o
very
good
session
beer
nice
and
relaxing
probably
my
favorite
nj
beer
and
definitely
my
favorite
nj
beer
under
5
abv
kudos
to
carton
brewing
they
have
this
beer
on
tap
at
trinity
restaurant
in
keyport
nj
it
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
leaving
behind
faint
lacing
on
the
glass
its
arromatics
are
comprised
of
a
yeast
and
citrus
undertones
its
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
carbonated
but
it
does
not
hurt
the
complex
subtle
flavors
of
this
excellent
session
beer
overall
worthy
of
a
try
due
to
its
uniqueness
updated
review
for
their
canned
version
first
batch
have
had
it
on
tap
growler
at
the
brewery
and
now
in
can
form
love
this
beer
finish
is
dry
and
thin
with
a
fittingly
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
well
made
besides
this
beer
and
some
pale
ales
ive
homebrewed
there
isnt
much
else
like
it
id
like
to
see
more
it
could
be
a
touch
drier
and
crisper
in
the
finish
but
overall
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
growing
monmouthocean
county
beer
scene
i
look
forward
to
getting
growlers
of
this
to
bring
to
the
beach
in
the
summer
thanks
joe
owhat
a
great
beer
i
will
buying
more
and
more
of
this
carton
boat
pours
a
very
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
the
head
lazily
makes
its
way
down
the
glass
leaving
plenty
of
nice
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
a
wonderfully
fruity
citrus
bomb
its
redolent
of
amarillo
hops
and
surprisingly
pungent
it
actually
took
a
little
bit
of
effort
for
me
to
pull
my
nose
out
of
the
glass
and
get
down
to
drinking
theres
a
bit
of
cracker
malt
sweetness
leading
things
off
before
all
those
hops
from
the
nose
come
barreling
through
all
the
grapefruit
and
mango
promised
by
the
nose
is
delivered
but
the
bit
of
bitterness
that
floats
through
midpalate
is
just
a
touch
oversized
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
bodied
with
a
subtly
bubbly
carbonation
cartons
boat
is
a
very
welcome
addition
to
the
local
scene
especially
at
5
a
pint
as
this
mashup
of
a
kolsch
and
apa
is
a
mostly
successful
one
10222011
this
is
certainly
a
beer
that
will
convince
you
that
you
can
brew
a
complex
beer
without
all
of
the
extra
alcohol
overall
an
incredible
beer
i
wish
that
they
would
bottle
or
can
this
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
the
summer
my
biggest
issue
with
beer
was
the
cloudiness
until
i
realized
that
this
beer
had
been
inappropriately
categorized
by
whoever
added
it
as
a
kolsch
thats
been
changed
and
i
guess
an
apa
is
closer
the
color
is
nice
and
light
and
the
head
is
pretty
high
and
frothy
looking
forward
to
seeing
boat
on
tap
at
the
atlantic
highlands
yacht
club
nicely
done
o
i
like
it
3
floyds
has
never
let
me
down
and
this
is
no
exception
top
notch
apa
overall
very
well
rounded
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
down
if
it
were
available
in
a
6
pack
and
i
was
in
the
three
floyds
distro
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
feel
like
its
strangely
similar
to
yum
yum
maybe
its
the
a
certain
type
of
hops
the
two
share
or
something
but
i
enjoyed
yum
yum
and
i
enjoyed
this
this
one
had
a
bit
of
the
same
funky
taste
which
i
didnt
care
for
not
sure
what
specific
ingredient
or
brewing
technique
attributes
to
this
but
if
anyone
knows
what
type
of
hops
ssmf
yum
yum
and
alpha
king
are
made
with
id
be
curious
to
know
while
this
is
good
im
not
sure
i
could
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
another
3f
pa
in
a
blind
taste
test
an
exceptional
apa
fruity
but
balanced
and
hoppy
well
done
once
again
3f
much
more
mellow
than
either
zd
or
alpha
king
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
this
is
possibly
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
it
pours
nicely
with
a
light
orangeish
color
and
a
light
head
the
smell
is
citrus
hops
with
a
little
pine
the
taste
is
not
as
hoppy
or
overwhelming
as
other
brews
by
3
floyds
like
zombie
dust
its
citrusy
with
a
slight
hop
at
first
followed
by
a
clean
malt
flavor
dont
be
scared
or
turned
away
by
the
price
tag
it
is
well
worth
it
overall
another
good
fff
this
ones
strength
is
balance
and
feel
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
thick
one
inch
head
smell
is
a
hop
forward
nice
citrus
zest
and
notes
of
tropical
fruit
very
mellow
start
nice
mouthfeel
with
sweeter
tropical
hop
notes
nice
malt
ballance
with
very
little
residing
bitterness
a
very
easy
going
well
balanced
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
had
on
tap
at
the
constant
spring
to
me
this
is
a
cross
of
yumyum
and
alpha
king
solid
beer
from
the
floyds
o
not
quite
as
hop
forward
as
zombie
dust
but
in
the
same
tier
of
quality
just
another
damn
great
apa
from
fff
its
absolutely
ridiculous
the
way
these
guys
do
beer
space
station
middle
finger
is
one
i
hope
gets
bottled
every
year
ill
buy
it
every
time
i
see
it
its
just
another
great
brew
from
the
guys
who
do
them
best
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
apa
this
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
daynight
pours
a
golden
hue
in
color
with
a
firm
white
head
that
stays
in
hand
for
the
first
few
sips
this
is
unmistakably
a
three
floyds
apa
has
that
often
present
blend
of
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
good
maltiness
on
the
back
end
and
a
full
hop
flavor
with
tropical
fruit
on
the
nose
excellent
blend
of
bitterness
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
and
a
slight
sweetness
to
balance
everything
goes
right
with
this
beer
and
at
6
i
feel
it
would
be
no
stretch
to
enjoy
a
22oz
of
this
one
too
glass
imperial
pint
apricots
and
tree
sap
for
days
o
very
nice
beer
not
permanent
funeral
but
very
awesome
tastes
great
smells
nice
looks
good
good
mouthfeel
like
it
and
will
get
it
again
pretty
good
beer
has
some
sour
notes
to
it
worth
a
try
for
sure
delicous
never
would
have
guessed
abv
was
only
6
0
drinks
much
more
like
a
heavybodied
ipa
just
a
fairly
average
pale
ale
nothing
remarkably
good
or
bad
about
it
o
another
good
pale
ale
from
3
fs
i
wont
search
for
this
one
but
would
gladly
pick
one
up
if
its
available
prost
clean
drinking
apa
nothing
too
notable
going
on
would
drink
again
overall
like
i
just
said
this
drinks
like
a
much
bigger
beer
than
it
actually
is
i
would
be
very
happy
if
every
6
hoppy
beer
felt
and
tasted
like
this
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
body
with
a
thick
beige
creamy
head
that
last
and
last
there
is
a
full
herbal
unripe
citrus
aroma
even
during
the
pour
the
taste
has
more
spicy
hop
flavor
with
some
nice
big
green
herbal
flavor
and
a
green
citrus
pith
finish
although
it
is
not
bitter
or
even
pungent
for
the
most
part
there
is
some
tropical
fruit
notes
as
it
opens
and
a
lime
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
the
creamy
mouthfeel
has
a
hop
boosting
crisp
fizz
this
has
nice
full
hops
that
are
big
but
not
punishing
very
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
delicious
golden
orange
with
a
nice
creamy
head
wonderful
hoppy
smell
extremely
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
great
finish
three
floyds
beers
seem
to
have
a
dance
between
the
hops
and
malt
tastes
and
neither
is
overbearing
but
work
well
together
great
beer
o
a
wellmade
beer
would
have
again
o
solid
interesting
citrus
hop
with
hints
of
lemon
but
nothing
remarkable
r
ottos
pours
a
dull
golden
orange
color
attractive
head
its
thick
and
white
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
strongly
hoppy
i
get
a
bunch
of
melon
notes
its
also
clearly
very
citrusy
i
get
a
bit
of
minty
hops
too
there
is
also
a
light
cookie
sweetness
the
flavor
births
a
lot
of
unique
hoppy
descriptors
in
my
mind
i
get
the
citrus
and
melon
right
away
i
also
get
the
mint
and
a
hard
to
describe
earthy
flavor
id
like
to
know
what
hops
are
being
used
here
as
it
warms
i
get
more
sweetness
grain
and
candied
citrus
character
hops
also
taste
lightly
lemony
surely
a
memorable
flavor
the
body
is
relatively
light
nice
carbonation
quite
spritzy
bitterness
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
pretty
much
an
ipa
for
all
intents
and
purposes
i
rarely
get
to
try
three
floyds
beers
and
was
very
happy
to
get
this
one
in
my
grasp
would
love
more
nice
work
fellas
very
floral
and
mild
ipa
i
think
its
actually
a
pale
but
is
more
like
a
very
mild
and
enjoyable
ipa
has
a
nice
hop
profile
that
you
can
enjoy
without
being
too
hop
heavy
or
abrasive
some
great
malt
tones
and
a
bit
of
a
creamy
feel
very
delicious
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
yellow
in
color
forms
a
moderate
sized
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
pleasant
mildly
sweet
with
a
distinct
floral
quality
citrus
orange
grapefruit
orange
blossom
taste
starts
off
rather
sweet
lots
of
citrus
with
some
tropical
fruits
neither
of
which
are
necessarily
all
that
juicy
mandarin
orange
papaya
maybe
some
mango
medium
bodied
mild
bitterness
appropriate
carbonation
overall
good
hop
flavor
like
many
of
the
three
floyds
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
has
too
sweet
and
sticky
of
a
malt
base
the
smell
is
a
lot
better
than
the
taste
the
taste
comes
over
too
sweet
and
doesnt
quite
let
the
hops
shine
16
oz
pint
on
draft
at
the
brewery
just
about
the
time
i
think
this
brewery
is
becoming
overrated
and
that
i
should
stop
trying
new
beers
of
theirs
this
one
hits
very
very
solid
pale
ale
drinkable
but
plenty
of
flavor
a
nice
pale
ale
but
no
more
its
certainly
not
the
zombie
dust
killer
some
bas
billed
it
as
would
be
a
good
buy
in
a
tenbucksixpack
but
this
beer
is
overpriced
in
a
tenbuckbomber
look
i
love
three
floyds
as
much
as
the
next
guy
and
have
been
a
cardcarrying
member
since
day
1
but
cult
status
and
cool
labels
have
led
to
a
lot
of
overhype
like
any
brewery
pumping
out
this
volume
of
different
brands
they
wont
all
be
winners
space
station
middle
finger
is
a
good
everyday
emblematic
american
pale
ale
nothing
less
but
nothing
more
serving
type
bottle
overall
great
stuff
the
hops
seem
familiar
but
different
the
first
time
i
came
across
this
beer
on
draft
i
finished
off
a
good
chunk
of
the
keg
and
left
a
lot
more
poor
the
bottle
while
not
quite
as
vibrant
as
draft
is
excellent
its
unique
to
the
core
bitter
delicious
and
easy
drinking
space
station
is
one
not
to
pass
up
bottle
opened

a
very
nice
pale
ale
with
good
balance
the
aroma
is
a
little
muted
but
good
flavor
three
months
old
was
looking
for
an
occasion
to
share
but
no
luck
aroma
is
tropical
fruit
heavy
with
notes
of
mango
and
pineapple
accenting
resin
and
a
toasted
caramel
malt
base
flavor
is
piney
and
resiny
with
tropical
fruit
and
grapefruit
underpinnings
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
no
zombie
dust
but
a
solid
offering
finish
falls
a
bit
short
o
one
solid
beer
maybe
not
zd
but
it
is
different
much
more
tropical
and
melon
favors
then
grapefruit
but
just
good
i
enjoyed
this
beer
greatly
overall
totally
off
my
radar
this
is
a
deliciously
different
apa
highly
recommended
dude
got
a
cheap
but
awesome
beer
here
is
your
lady
im
about
speechless
outstanding
tremendously
tremendous
nice
beer
quite
along
the
3floyds
line
overall
very
good
brew
that
id
like
more
of
nice
hazy
golden
pour
def
tastes
like
a
fff
brew
clean
subtle
and
smooth
damn
good
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
anything
different
from
their
other
hoppy

this
can
definitely
pass
for
an
ipa
its
really
the
craftsmanship
that
sells
this
beer
for
me
they
pack
a
whole
lot
into
6
nice
beer
but
id
personally
take
zd
or
alpha
king
over
this
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
still
good

from

they

another

that

citrus
aroma
taste
is
light
little
bit
of
caramel
flavor
with
a
bunch
of
bitterness
on
the
tongue
o
another
solid
beer
from
fff
very
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
also
love
the
bottle
art
melon
rind
and
lime
zest
on
the
nose
and
the
flavor
more
like
an
ipa
in
terms
of
balance
and
mouthfeel
to
me
abv
backs
that
up
pretty
dark
blondeamber
colored
so
theres
plenty
of
malt
bill
there
prickly
bitterness
throughout
smooth
pale
ale
that
is
very
sessionable
clean
fresh
nicely
made
pale
ale
tastes
like
a
citrus
christmas
tree
plenty
of
hops
but
limited
bitterness
nice
o
this
beer
is
freaking
awesome
in
my
opinion
it
is
juicy
but
different
than
all
the
citra
pale
ales
that
are
out
there
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
zombie
dust
but
i
have
yet
to
drink
zd
this
fresh
loved
the
melon
i
got
in
this
beer
delicious
awesome
brew
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
sample
it
fresh
alas
the
waning
sips
begin
to
suppress
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
hops
pull
forth
showing
a
strong
ipa
set
of
proportions
its
maltydry
finish
is
resinous
and
peppery
as
flavors
of
freshcut
grass
chive
and
leaf
offer
a
snappy
resinous
closure
with
aftertaste
of
tropical
fruit
clean
drink
light
hoppy
smell
finishes
a
little
bitter
but
overall
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
food
had
a
great
burger
with
this
one
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
apa
an
imperial
version
would
be
lovely
though
o
not
a
typical
fff
pale
ale
at
all
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
blanketing
while
drinking
the
nose
is
ripe
with
grapefruit
and
slightly
floral
has
a
great
malty
sweetness
and
negligible
booze
this
smells
similar
to
zd
but
is
less
citraforward
the
taste
is
generously
hopped
but
not
overly
bitter
and
doesnt
seem
dominated
by
a
single
hop
characteristic
the
hop
profile
feel
west
coasty
but
still
maintains
that
perfect
malt
characteristic
that
sets
3
floyds
apas
apart
its
relatively
lightbodied
balanced
well
carbonated
clean
and
very
hopcentric
but
still
1010
in
drinkability
the
bomber
drinks
faster
than
some
12oz
bottles
id
highly
recommend
this
buy
if
you
can
grab
fresh
bottles
overall
a
solid
and
welldone
pale
ale
but
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
thanks
to
batfireman
for
including
it
as
an
extra
this
is
a
great
brew
but
it
needs
just
a
touch
more
to
push
it
over
the
edge
not
sure
of
the
price
point
but
definitely
recommended
o
a
really
nice
pale
ale
not
many
complaints
on
this
one
here
o
not
overly
hoppy
and
has
structure
and
flavors
that
are
very
much
in
harmony
very
well
made
and
tasty
o
not
as
impressed
by
this
as
i
thought
i
would
be
it
tastes
nice
but
was
looking
for
something
more
juicy
verdict
a
very
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
from
three
floyds
another
successful
take
on
hops
in
a
more
palatable
and
less
aggressive
manner
than
many
of
their
beers
the
balance
is
nice
perhaps
it
could
be
more
pungent
and
bright
but
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
final
thoughts
pricey
but
unique
if
you
can
get
it
try
it
especially
if
you
like
zombie
dust
an
outstanding
american
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bitter
and
sticky
from
lots
of
hoppy
oils
overall
another
world
class
beer
from
fff
one
of
my
new
favorites
o
basic
and
typical
fff
beer
not
blown
away
and
wont
have
another
one
ill
stick
to
alpha
king
bomber
as
an
awesome
trade
extra
big
thanks
pours
a
deep
reddish
orange
color
with
a
creamy
nearly
offwhite
head
that
lingers
a
nice
but
aroma
is
piney
citrus
rinds
juicy
mango
light
toffee
flavor
is
a
juicy
mango
flavor
with
very
light
citrus
rinds
and
a
bit
if
caramel
sweetness
no
date
on
the
bottle
so
no
idea
if
it
is
fresh
assume
it
is
low
bitterness
resinous
body
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
pale
ale
if
on
the
unexciting
side
would
drink
it
any
day
o
i
really
liked
this
pale
ale
i
thought
it
was
great
reminded
me
a
bit
of
pseudo
sue
citra
hops
here
my
complaint
would
be
the
price
i
paid
for
the
bomber
of
course
no
one
had
a
gun
to
my
head
love
to
see
this
in
six
packs
for
like
12
99
that
would
be
just
fine
by
me
in
any
case
it
was
quite
delicious
and
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
great
flavors
and
aromas
another
great
one
three
floyds
never
disappoints
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
taste
the
smell
is
similar
to
a
mix
of
pride
and
joy
with
alpha
king
but
i
get
that
earthiness
in
the
flavor
good
oanother
good
apa
from
fff
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
zd
but
it
is
still
a
yummy
one
love
when
they
bottle
more
of
their
stuff
taste
is
more
fruit
forward
with
the
dried
apricot
flavor
at
first
a
pale
malt
middle
and
a
long
lasting
resiny
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
light
fruity
sweetness
up
front
dovetails
nicely
into
the
bitter
hop
resiny
finish
easy
drinking
would
get
this
again
anytime
on
tap
at
the
brewery
poured
into
nonic
pint
huge
head
and
golden
color
big
sweet
candy
hop
aromas
fresh
hop
and
a
tad
hint
of
yeast
taste
is
smooth
crisp
pale
malt
with
a
big
candy
hop
flavor
some
earthy
hop
as
well
maybe
its
dry
but
a
little
thin
and
somewhat
bitter
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
ipa
well
worth
a
detour
to
have
a
pint
d
3f
should
bottle
this
absolutely
phenomenal
a
fine
and
drinkable
pale
from
floyds
that
doesnt
break
any
molds
overall
solid
apa
not
too
bitter
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
ale
asylum
hopalicious
but
quite
a
bit
better
great
head
and
lacing
with
a
hazy
golden
color
completely
different
smell
citrus
pine
pineapple
smell
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
and
kind
of
bitter
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
different
pale
ale
o
wish
i
could
have
this
one
is
a
large
quantity
crazy
delicious
with
an
intense
aroma
that
i
wasnt
expecting
for
something
that
i
had
never
heard
of
at
the
time
hope
to
see
this
one
brewed
again
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
american
ipa
if
i
remember
correctly
this
was
sngle
hopped
with
galaxy
i
could
be
wrong
think
zombie
dust
with
galaxy
hops
i
hope
they
brew
this
one
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
this
sip
started
appropriately
sweetly
progressing
to
a
full
herbal
bitter
malty
and
organically
complex
flavoring
the
finish
was
particularly
interesting
with
big
starchiness
and
licorice
bite
the
latter
was
also
noted
in
the
aroma
adding
bitterness
there
to
the
otherwise
sweetly
blended
base
the
more
you
drink
this
beer
the
better
it
gets
as
the
flavoring
and
sip
muddle
a
bit
when
cold
this
beer
will
blossom
for
you
closer
to
cellar
temps
and
sip
very
nicely
tastes
very
much
as
it
smells
wonderful
apa
juicy
fruit
up
front
moving
into
more
bitter
higheralpha
nodes
in
the
middle
and
end
nice
balance
but
my
dumb
personal
taste
wishes
it
was
more
of
the
start
and
less
of
the
finish
overall
personally
i
found
this
better
than
zombie
dust
in
a
side
by
side
quite
possibly
three
floyds
best
hoppy
beer
yet
overall
another
wonderful
pale
ale
from
these
guys
they
know
pale
ale
and
make
just
fantastic
examples
real
easy
drinking
as
well
to
boot
d
a
nice
pale
ale
that
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
bitter
for
heavy
session
potential
still
whatever
this
hop
is
its
a
good
one
and
i
hope
it
makes
it
into
more
beers
in
the
future
a
good
beer
but
id
actually
prefer
supa
rice
in
large
quantities
an
awesome
beer
an
amazing
compliment
to
their
other
amazing
pale
zombie
dust
as
always
three
floyds
excels
in
the
hop
department
overall
an
excellent
hoppy
pale
ale
overall
this
is
pretty
killer
very
happy
i
have
an
imperial
pint
of
this
to
drink
so
juicy
and
tropical
get
some
of
this
an
absolutely
amazing
to
drink
sits
right
there
with
zombie
dust
maybe
even
better
honestly
wish
i
could
have
taken
a
growler
or
two
or
three
if
youre
a
three
floyds
fan
and
you
live
near
the
pub
do
yourself
a
favor
and
make
a
trip
to
try
this
beer
hopefully
thisll
become
a
regular
production
beer
o
different
hop
profile
than
zombie
not
as
much
citrus
was
told
it
was
an
experimental
hop
not
named
yet
i
would
drink
this
along
with
zombie
all
day
long
a
really
good
pale
ale
hoping
they
bottle
this
one
lets
all
push
hard
to
force
fff
to
make
it
year
round
bottle
this
one
overall
while
aroma
and
flavor
are
light
the
creamy
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
keeps
this
interesting
and
going
back
for
another
sip
surprisingly
bland
i
bought
into
the
blanket
the
market
hype
should
have
read
up
first
in
a
blind
taste
test
it
could
be
a
domestic
lager
almost
semi
sweet
very
little
hop
bite
sweetwater
420
extra
pale
ale
45
i
really
want
to
love
sweetwater
because
its
easy
for
me
to
find
here
in
va
but
it
just
isnt
in
the
cards
i
will
happily
drink
their
beers
when
offered
but
there
are
many
better
options
available
great
beer
paired
with
pizza
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
pleasant
on
the
nose
and
lacks
any
real
hoppy
taste
that
i
enjoy
regarding
ipa
taste
is
average
ive
bought
it
a
few
times
when
building
a
6pack
but
likely
wont
venture
to
it
again
its
just
okay
there
are
better
extra
pale
ales
out
there
but
this
will
do
if
you
are
in
the
atlanta
area
not
a
bad
beer
decent
taste
for
sure
the
marketing
is
highly
amusing
too
imo
a
great
representation
of
the
style
wheres
the
hops
damn
disappointing
really
enjoyed
this
beer
light
smooth
very
drinkable
decent
home
state
brewed
beer
nice
curveball
if
you
want
one
ugh
very
disappointing
with
so
many
taps
in
the
se
only
ok
not
great
on
nose
and
hops
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
3x
better
and
i
usually
trash
sn
clean
and
crisp
refreshing
not
overly
hoppy
above
average
for
me
thus
a
4
nothing
special
but
not
terrible
pours
a
goldenamber
slightly
sweet
herbalpine
flavor
fairly
mild
and
smooth
an
in
depth
review
is
not
nesc
refer
to
rating
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
that
coming
from
a
guy
who
isnt
really
in
to
hoppy
beers
love
the
label
love
the
look
overall
ill
give
sweetwater
420
extra
pale
ale
sweetwater
brewing
company
a
4
25
this
is
a
quenching
brew
that
ill
probably
grab
again
sweetwater
420
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
the
smell
is
rich
with
hops
and
grains
you
also
pick
up
on
some
malts
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
now
for
the
taste
it
is
bold
with
flavor
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
hops
is
the
first
thing
you
pick
up
on
but
it
is
not
over
powering
to
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
bitter
but
smooth
sweetwater
420
extra
pale
ale
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
of
5
one
of
my
favorites
the
extra
pale
makes
it
very
mild
in
terms
of
bitter
hoppiness
refreshing
pale
ale
very
safe
and
enjoyable
a
goto
summer
beer
no
pale
ale
has
ever
blown
me
away
it
was
ok
nothing
outstanding
here
but
a
good
warm
weather
beer
pours
golden
with
lots
of
sediment
white
head
well
retained
smells
of
yeasts
bready
malts
and
hops
tastes
of
cool
malts
and
then
spicy
citrusy
floral
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
lasting
finish
highly
average
pale
ale
look
smell
and
feel
are
on
point
in
line
with
what
youd
expect
from
a
straightforward
pale
ale
though
nothing
really
noteworthy
that
stands
out
but
the
taste
is
very
singlenote
sharply
bitter
in
an
unpleasant
way
not
pleasantly
hoppy
i
am
really
surprised
to
see
this
one
rated
as
low
as
it
is
i
mean
a
nice
crisp
citrusy
low
alcohol
american
pale
thats
balanced
without
being
heavy
distinct
on
the
hops
and
about
as
refreshing
as
one
could
imagine
deliciously
fresh
bursting
with
lemony
hop
aromatics
and
a
hint
of
orange
zest
to
the
taste
great
hot
weather
session
beer
and
i
think
easily
my
favorite
beer
i
have
had
from
these
guys
no
caramel
malts
getting
in
the
way
it
stays
nice
and
light
pale
like
a
pale
ale
should
be
but
so
few
really
are
anymore
not
trying
to
do
too
much
while
simultaneously
doing
it
all
love
it
boring
thats
all
i
have
to
say
first
sweetwater
beer
im
intrigued
and
want
to
try
more
this
is
decent
offering
for
the
style
it
is
very
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
no
significant
aroma
slightly
hazy
with
a
foam
that
sticks
around
a
little
extra
hoppy
with
some
florally
taste
its
got
a
bite
as
it
settles
in
the
mouth
almost
sessionable
if
you
need
to
pick
up
a
12
or
case
wonderfully
sweet
but
not
oversweet
pale
ale
with
a
hop
bite
that
almost
anyone
can
enjoy
unique
and
great
tasting
pale
ale
lighter
and
more
hoppy
than
some
other
pale
ales
love
to
see
the
unfiltered
sediment
gets
me
excited
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
would
recommend
letting
the
beer
warm
up
if
it
was
in
the
fridge
much
better
at
around
4550
degrees
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
deffintly
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
yet
done
so
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
lunch
something
different
than
the
beers
i
usually
drink
that
went
very
nicely
with
the
food
no
clashing
of
flavors
noticed
despite
how
drastically
different
they
werepineyminty
pale
ale
vs
salty
fries
and
spicy
chicken
im
glad
i
ordered
it
its
easy
to
find
in
stores
around
here
so
its
nice
to
know
if
i
ever
feel
like
drinking
something
more
hoppy
than
the
usual
and
dont
want
to
worry
about
the
high
bitterness
that
tends
to
come
with
stronger
beers
like
ipas
i
wont
have
to
go
far
to
find
a
pint
or
a
sixpack
of
this
one
tastetropical
fruit
piney
hops
bitter
edge
throughout
overall
nice
flavor
and
character
this
is
a
very
common
beer
in
florida
i
finally
picked
one
up
most
stores
sale
6packs
but
i
finally
found
one
that
sells
them
loose
its
similar
to
sierra
pale
ale
but
a
bit
more
dry
pretty
solid
beer
mine
was
pretty
close
to
its
expiration
date
had
it
been
fresh
and
on
draught
it
could
have
scored
even
higher
in
my
book
as
it
was
not
a
bad
option
l
poured
a
1inch
of
fluffy
white
head
with
a
honey
colored
body
and
as
you
drink
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
s
nice
hoppy
aroma
mf
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
t
a
great
bitter
taste
throughout
the
drink
with
a
very
mellow
sweet
grainslike
balance
and
with
each
sip
there
is
a
wonderful
clean
finish
overall
a
great
ipa
reasonable
taste
for
an
apa
maybe
the
first
craft
i
ever
really
had
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
it

and
stays
quite

some

taste
is

you
can

this
one
on

for
whatever
it
was
an
ok
one
crisp
and
not
too
hoppy
good
beer
good
beer
to
drink
in
an
evening
expected
hops
hops
and
more
hops
its
a
bit
of
a
singlenote
beer
but
its
played
well
a
bit
of
a
citrus
aftertaste
grapefruit
particularly
love
it
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
this
is
a
good
one
i
live
in
michigan
but
lived
in
georgia
for
3
years
so
got
my
first
taste
of
this
from
draft
and
it
was
great
any
time
i
visit
ga
or
have
anyone
from
ga
coming
to
mi
i
request
23
cases
to
come
with
them
for
a
visit
it
definitely
has
a
fruity
side
but
its
an
overall
great
summer
beer
if
youre
planning
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
give
this
one
a
consideration
i
love
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
i
keep
it
on
tap
overall
a
wellmade
extra
pale
ale
i
liked
it
overall
and
it
added
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
where
i
was
eating
i
had
this
with
quail
a
good
combination
id
definitely
get
it
again

a
must
try
for
those
who
love
ipas
this
beer
is
well
crafted
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
dont
get
me
overly
excited
yes
they
stay
true
to
style
its
not
bad
but
its
not
memorable
and
there
are
many
other
examples
of
the
style
that
i
personally
enjoy
more
o
a
bit
simple
compared
to
many
of
the
bold
ales
out
there
these
days
but
at
the
same
time
its
nice
to
be
able
to
relax
with
a
beer
thats
tasty
and
not
over
the
top
remarks
not
bad
overall
i
got
it
while
camping
and
was
happy
with
it
overall
it
is
what
is
im
not
sure
if
i
care
that
their
in
ohio
now
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nice
look
when
poured
generous
head
definite
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
very
nice
easy
drinking
ipanice
aftertaste
smooth
subtle
is
the
operative
descriptor
with
this
one
easy
drinking
with
a
perfect
bitterness
definitely
fits
the
easy
going
image
of
the
brewery
perfect
420
beer
to
quench
ones
thirst
as
to
the
negative
reviews
maybe
you
just
need
to
step
back
and
chill
on
this
one
youre
definitely
not
getting
it
water
is
definitely
the
operative
word
here
but
its
tasty
enough
compared
to
everything
else
we
had
while
in
the
area
it
was
pretty
darn
good
its
very
ok
pretty
average
beer
ended
up
buying
a
sixer
wish
i
could
have
gotten
a
single
taste
is
bitter
earthy
grass
some
malt
flavors
really
just
ok
overall
pretty
standard
and
a
safe
beer
seemed
lacking
compared
to
what
i
expected
quite
nice
extremely
light
pale
ale
lacks
excitement
next
to
other
pas
easy
drinking
this
is
a
tame
ipa
and
on
the
light
side
if
you
lean
towards
a
light
beer
ipa
buy
it
i
prefer
more
ibus
recently
started
to
try
this
so
far
so
good
o
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
i
certainly
didnt
love
it
no
need
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
o
an
average
pa
not
real
flavorful
more
malt
than
hop
but
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
definitely
more
epa
than
apa
but
still
just
ok
enjoy
the
color
of
this
beer
has
a
haze
of
orange
color
to
it
i
could
taste
the
hops
in
this
beer
it
has
a
malty
taste
to
it
as
well
it
was
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
from
sweetwater
but
it
was
not
that
bad
it
had
a
bitter
finish
to
it
as
well
it
also
finished
on
the
dry
side
as
well
o
its
on
the
average
side
for
pale
ales
hop
flavor
really
disappointed
me
o
nice
to
drink
but
not
memorable
the
metallic
taste
was
a
little
off
putting
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
slightly
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
citrus
and
piney
his
orange
jumps
out
tastes
of
slight
piney
and
earthy
hops
with
some
citrus
but
kind
of
opposite
of
the
aroma
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
very
smooth
light
body
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
an
extremely
drinkable
pale
ale
that
is
enjoyable
for
all
beer
drinkers
from
the
novice
to
the
veteran
very
good
beer
recommended
to
me
and
i
like
it
would
definitely
enjoy
420
again
well
crafted
o
this
beer
has
a
great
look
but
the
smell
is
simple
and
the
taste
needs
something
a
little
extra
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
use
something
more
poured
this
gift
into
a
pint
glass
nice
light
amber
color
and
a
pretty
sticky
twofinger
white
head
that
produces
a
little
lace
get
an
aroma
of
rising
bread
dough
and
some
floral
hops
sweet
smelling
too
flavors
are
white
yeast
sweet
bread
with
a
tinge
of
caramelvanilla
and
a
very
pleasant
mild
but
slightly
peppery
and
grassy
hop
nip
nice
feel
and
carbonation
i
like
this
one
a
lot
could
drink
several
of
these
it
tasted
a
little
like
an
ipa
but
not
as
ipaish
much
better
colder
than
when
it
warmed
up
sitting
on
the
table
i
could
see
drinking
this
beer
in
the
summer
or
the
winter
and
i
could
probably
drink
more
than
one
eric
o
a
very
decent
pale
ale
with
a
slightly
interesting
flavor
over
all
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
nice
golden
color
i
poured
mine
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
and
it
actually
had
pretty
consistent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
mild
bite
of
hops
to
it
not
overpowering
and
leaves
a
good
taste
in
your
mouth
after
you
take
a
sip
i
would
say
this
one
shoots
right
down
the
middle
for
me
as
a
good
pale
ale
probable
the
palest
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
it
wasnt
kidding
about
being
extra
pale
extremely
crisp
and
drinkable
with
just
a
tiny
hops
edge
along
with
some
pine
undertones
pours
clear
amber
hit
the
spot
on
a
summer
day
overall
a
good
beer
not
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
but
still
a
nice
hopiness
that
gives
this
beer
some
real
flavor
most
certainly
will
have
again
odelicious
extra
pale
ale
drank
it
for
lunch
in
savannah
ga
pours
out
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
head
has
moderate
retention
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aided
with
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
mild
with
mostly
caramel
sweetness
dominating
the
taste
is
also
pretty
mild
with
some
fruit
and
stronger
if
less
defined
bitterness
theres
a
pretty
good
weight
to
the
body
and
a
little
bite
from
the
carbonation
a
good
pale
ale
overall
an
acceptable
pale
ale
but
this
one
just
seems
like
your
typical
well
made
pale
ale
from
the
craft
scene
1020
years
ago
there
are
just
too
many
better
made
and
flavorful
pales
on
the
market
today
making
this
one
very
forgettable
still
an
easy
drinker
but
forgettable
overall
420
is
an
excellent
session
ale
hard
to
criticize
this
beer
it
presents
as
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
to
the
palate
overall
i
have
had
better
glad
i
tried
it
a
nice
cheap
summer
drinker
thats
easy
to
put
down
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
o
a
lightweight
summer
refresher
the
lack
of
body
helps
it
be
so
but
does
not
encourage
a
particularly
positive
overall
impression
o
every
beer
has
its
place
to
me
this
fulfills
a
role
similar
to
fat
tire
or
boston
lager
in
that
its
a
rocksolid
everyday
beer
frankly
its
a
bit
better
than
fat
tire
but
thats
neither
here
nor
there
this
isnt
a
beer
that
bowls
you
over
with
flavor
or
complexity
this
is
something
you
kill
by
the
6
pack
while
barbecuing
or
fishing
because
of
this
it
gets
3
5s
across
the
board
from
me
overall
solid
but
typical
apa
overall
its
allright
but
nothing
is
get
if
i
had
an
option
overall
my
dad
recommended
this
to
me
as
possibly
the
best
beer
in
america
in
the
oldworld
style
of
good
real
ale
this
beer
is
hard
to
beat
the
balance
between
biscuit
fruit
and
bitterness
is
just
too
good
to
miss
a
hair
less
sweetness
for
more
bitterness
and
youd
have
me
cramming
perfect
5
00s
all
the
way
down
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
beer
is
so
unique
there
is
no
other
like
it
im
more
of
an
ipa
guy
myself
and
while
this
is
not
an
ipa
it
is
close
very
hoppy
for
a
non
ipa
i
live
in
atl
and
this
beer
is
everywhere
here
i
feel
sorry
for
those
who
cannot
get
your
hands
on
this
it
is
truly
a
treat
o
a
good
hoppy
pale
ale
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
medium
gold
with
lots
each
of
both
brightness
and
clarity
its
certainly
pale
but
edging
toward
amber
the
head
is
compact
very
close
to
pure
white
and
almost
one
finger
tall
lace
consists
of
both
patching
and
spotting
the
aroma
takes
some
time
before
the
hops
come
out
it
starts
grainy
but
that
backs
down
as
it
breathes
when
it
does
it
displays
a
simple
balance
of
floral
bitterness
and
biscuit
while
a
ghost
of
buttery
sweet
grains
flashes
in
vaguely
and
briefly
the
hops
take
time
on
the
tongue
as
well
floral
with
a
little
rawness
biscuit
is
still
there
in
the
malts
though
the
butter
vanishes
entirely
it
takes
on
some
dryness
as
hops
bitterness
shows
a
leafy
aspect
breadiness
in
the
malts
adds
texture
to
the
body
while
it
bites
on
the
tongue
the
body
eases
toward
light
mf
med
body
with
no
lasting
bitterness

would
go

nothing

the
rest
a

if

it

this
is
going
to
seem

but
the
nose
reminded
me
of
golden
raisins
andor
honey
plus
a
breadiness
wild
mouthfeel
was
pretty
full
for
the
style
and
i
swear
that
it
tasted
more
like
honey
than
the
mead
i
had
on
wednesday
it
would
not
be
sustaining
for
a
hophead
but
it
was
a
nice
diversion
finish
was
so
honeylike
that
i
began
to
question
whether
i
might
not
be
drinking
a
lager
it
was
very
sweet
especially
for
the
style
what
were
they
smoking
when
they
developed
this
recipe
golden
finish
very
clear
beer
had
a
nice
floral
aroma
but
finished
much
more
malty
than
i
expected
from
a
pale
ale
though
it
was
a
nice
surprise
was
served
in
a
tulip
glass
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
but
that
could
have
been
the
keg
i
would
order
this
again
good
beer
not
bad
this
beer
was
purchased
at
ingles
market
in
athens
tn
in
a
6
pack
of
bottles
consumed
one
a
night
for
6
days
appearance
is
a
brownish
copper
has
notes
of
citrus
caramel
and
flowery
overtones
very
strong
hop
notes
extremely
carbonated
very
light
malt
notes
very
drinkable
but
the
carbonation
level
needs
to
be
backed
off
nice
fruity
caramel
taste
which
has
heavy
hop
notes
needs
more
malt
to
balance
the
palate
very
excellent
overall
for
its
class
easily
a
3
84
out
of
5
the
same
easily
available
in
my
area
as
are
most
all
sweetwater
beers
are
would
have
this
beer
again
enjoy
this
a
lot
a
mediocre
extra
pale
ale
id
pass
on
it
next
time
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
it
gave
me
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
small
foamy
head
the
smell
has
a
citrus
and
some
malt
to
it
the
taste
has
a
crisp
malt
backbone
with
a
good
cittus
hop
flavor
to
follow
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
good
ale
this
was
solid
good
beer
nice
golden
creamy
color
and
a
lace
that
lingers
smelled
malty
and
crisp
a
little
citric
but
not
very
strong
taste
was
bready
and
malty
really
nice
dry
hop
finish
though
drinkable
and
good
perhaps
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
definitely
worth
a
try
rjt
has
always
and
will
always
be
my
goto
beer
for
the
summer
this
one
has
a
much
more
citrus
kick
than
any
ipa
i
have
had
and
almost
has
a
rush
of
grapefruit
on
the
initial
sip
until
the
hops
come
into
play
i
dont
mind
the
stronger
carbonation
but
i
can
see
where
this
may
be
a
turn
off
to
some
the
citrus
notes
really
take
the
edge
off
the
abv
so
be
careful
or
not
lest
you
start
feeling
all
warm
and
fuzzy
inside
if
youre
anywhere
in
the
southeast
look
for
the
rainbow
trout
on
the
tap
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
taste
is
grassy
malty
and
grainy
but
very
light
light
hops
end
the
taste
super
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
the
carbonation
has
no
bite
this
tastes
and
feels
watery
the
watery
feel
makes
it
very
easy
but
the
watery
taste
detracts
from
what
could
be
a
relatively
well
done
beer
flavor
has
some
toasty
malt
as
well
with
a
nice
little
touch
of
sweetness
hops
are
there
but
have
a
rindy
bitterness
its
not
overly
citrussy
again
much
more
rindy
pithy
and
bitter
than
anything
else
not
bad
better
fresh
well
if
offered
one
i
would
try
another
but
i
won
t
seek
it
out

wow
if
i
could
get
sweetwater
here
this
would
be
a
regular
pick
up
for
me
really
well
done
stuff
i
guess
this
goes
to
show
that
ba
ratings
are
all
subjective
this
gets
a
83
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
then
some
of
the
top
apas
i
have
had
my
hat
is
off
to
you
sweetwater
o
this
is
a
tasty
pale
ale
it
has
enough
hops
to
make
it
noticeable
but
not
so
much
to
confuse
it
with
an
ipa
very
enjoyable
overall
a
quite
drinkable
pale
ale
with
good
hop
dankness
or
frankness
rather
drinkable
and
enjoyable
worth
swigging
on
a
hot
summer
night
thats
for
damn
sure
doing
ga
proud
on
this
one
overall
3
50
good
standard
beer
flavor
balance
is
welltuned
and
refreshing
those
of
us
who
are
not
hopobsessed
not
me
will
appreciated
the
focus
on
malt
and
grain
balance
present
in
this
brew
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
the
sweetness
is
cloying
which
interferes
with
certain
foods
such
as
salty
pizza
salty
cheeses
etc
overall
however
this
is
a
solid
beer
get
past
the
foolishness
of
their
marketing
and
there
is
a
rocksolid
center
whoda
thunk
it
overall
nothing
really
stood
out
for
me
with
this
one
not
sure
what
else
to
say
about
it
guess
im
uninspired
a
decent
beer
just
not
very
hoppy
no
off
flavors
but
misses
the
mark
on
style
well
i
guess
i
wont
fight
the
tide
here
a
fine
beer
and
one
that
i
can
definitely
see
myself
ordering
again
maybe
im
a
little
new
to
the
game
when
it
comes
to
finer
beers
but
i
still
cant
quite
see
how
this
is
classified
as
a
pale
ale
its
got
way
more
bite
than
other
pale
ales
ive
drank
in
the
past
but
thats
not
dragging
this
beers
name
in
the
mud
or
anything
its
top
stuff
have
had
a
ton
of
this
beer
highly
recommend
as
most
of
all
sweetwater
beers
are
amazing
its
starting
to
get
more
and
more
popular
in
bars
and
restaurants
as
far
as
the
taps
go
you
can
find
it
in
just
about
any
beer
store
in
the
southeast
if
you
see
it
try
it
overall
a
pretty
boring
beer
very
light
and
subtly
flavoured
to
be
fair
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
easy
to
session
but
there
are
other
beers
id
rather
have
for
that
purpose
hope
they
stick
aroun
awhile
250
words
characters
well
its
good
and
real
good
ok
that
should
cover
it
dam
type
qty
we
aint
in
school
no
more
overall
this
is
a
great
apa
by
far
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
ooverall
i
could
sit
and
drink
a
few
maybe
more
than
a
few
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
o
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
not
very
complex
but
worth
a
try
if
your
looking
for
a
lighter
session
beer
overall
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
here
o
pretty
disappointing
not
sure
if
this
an
old
keg
or
what
but
there
are
almost
no
hop
characters
in
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
no
better
than
average
that
being
said
i
find
myself
drinking
this
fairly
often
as
its
often
times
the
one
craft
beer
among
an
otherwise
bmc
lineup
at
many
restaurants
bars
here
in
the
south
east
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
very
summery
but
could
be
enjoyed
in
the
fall
i
wouldnt
pick
this
beer
for
a
cold
winters
day
by
the
fireplace
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
o
i
think
this
beer
is
highly
sessionable
and
quite
nice
to
be
honest
as
previously
mentioned
its
not
overly
complex
and
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
smell
faintly
of
hops
and
some
biscuit
malt
tastes
is
fairly
hoppy
for
a
session
pale
ale
and
a
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
just
about
perfect
for
a
session
beer
overall
amazing
session
beer
if
this
were
avaliable
in
my
area
i
would
drink
it
non
stop
from
april
until
october
i
just
really
love
this
beer
like
an
old
friend
420
never
fails
to
please
an
excellent
example
of
a
well
rounded
well
balanced
pale
ale
great
year
round
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
different
with
a
great
balance
wonderful
color
great
pairing
with
burgers
or
ribs
ive
been
looking
for
an
everyday
craft
brew
for
quite
a
while
and
so
far
sweetwater
420
fits
the
bill
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
lots
of
malts
a
youch
of
hops
taste
is
malty
caramel
some
hops
well
balanced
and
very
easy
drinking
enjoyable
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
o
i
dont
understand
all
of
the
hype
behind
this
one
its
good
not
great
o
spoton
for
the
style
and
super
sessionable
if
you
want
flavorful
yet
drinkable
beer
go
for
some
sweetwater
i
wish
they
had
wider
distribution
so
i
could
get
it
all
the
time
what
i
love
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
light
and
flavorfulthis
beer
is
perfect
any
time
of
the
year
but
especially
a
hot
day
on
the
beach
in
the
summer
leaves
a
small
pale
ale
taste
in
your
mouth
the
smell
isnt
strong
but
has
a
good
flavor
over
all
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
around
o
after
having
a
couple
of
these
in
a
bar
in
southern
georgia
i
had
to
look
up
the
style
i
was
certain
it
was
a
pisner
or
a
czech
pilz
a
lager
of
some
kind
clearly
i
was
wrong
if
you
like
gi
honkers
ale
or
sa
boston
lager
this
has
a
very
similar
vibe
but
with
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
great
drinking
ipa
it
is
not
a
super
hoppy
monster
but
that
is
not
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
i
think
it
fills
the
niche
of
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
very
well
its
got
a
good
level
of
citrus
and
carbonation
its
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
and
you
can
just
keep
on
drinking
it
overall
a
good
beer
perfect
for
anything
from
tailgating
to
a
night
out
i
enjoy
this
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
just
crazy
drinkable
light
grainy
gold
with
a
solid
quilt
of
fine
white
foam
smells
faint
grain
sweet
malts
some
corn
and
a
little
grassy
dried
grass
taste
is
corn
resin
a
little
bitterness
really
tastes
cheap
almost
reminds
me
of
corn
pops
cereal
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
meh
ap
the
pour
is
clear
and
burnt
orange
in
color
with
a
small
fluffy
white
head
s
the
nose
is
somewhat
floral
with
a
light
citrus
component
very
light
t
the
hop
profile
is
almost
all
floral
medium
long
finish
that
may
be
the
most
satisfying
component
of
each
sip
m
the
body
is
on
the
light
end
of
medium
with
a
crisp
and
plentiful
carbonation
o
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
however
the
floral
hops
and
the
lightly
sweet
taste
provide
a
refreshing
brew
fairly
disappointing
in
both
malt
and
hop
presence
pretty
flat
flavor
overall
420
seems
light
on
the
hops
and
heavy
on
the
sweets
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
by
any
means
as
the
beer
proves
to
be
justly
drinkable
o
a
light
crisp
pale
with
dry
bitterness
this
in
no
way
resembles
the
hop
forward
pale
ales
that
have
emerged
in
recent
years
such
as
zombie
dust
and
perpetual
an
adjunctlike
malt
bill
and
one
dimensional
hop
presence
make
this
a
classic
pale
which
doesnt
make
it
bad
just
not
particularly
impressive
i
would
say
this
is
the
least
enjoyable
of
the
sweetwater
year
rounds
for
me
o
pretty
mellow
all
around
nothing
bad
to
say
it
just
doesnt
jump
out
at
me
as
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
with
the
lighter
body
lower
abv
and
well
balanced
flavors
between
the
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
big
thick
head
tons
of
carbonation
very
pretty
pale
ale
smells
great
juicy
pine
hops
not
overwhelmingly
piney
just
the
right
amount
for
a
pale
ale
herbal
and
flowery
as
well
goes
down
smooth
and
crisp
nice
light
mouthfeel
however
im
picking
up
a
slightly
metallicy
taste
which
i
dont
expect
out
of
any
craft
beer
overall
its
a
good
beer
to
compliment
any
meal
or
occasion
but
there
are
better
apas
out
there
this
is
a
rare
example
where
i
prefer
the
brewerys
pale
ale
to
its
ipa
i
can
see
why
this
beer
has
its
good
reputation
i
must
admit
on
tap
it
is
slight
better
fresher
all
around
and
just
as
easy
to
drink
at
a
bar
as
it
is
at
home
on
tap
while
on
a
trip
with
the
wife
to
amelia
island
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
color
with
a
slight
white
head
nice
sweet
citrus
and
floral
aroma
flavor
is
a
nice
citrus
bite
with
sweet
light
malts
balancing
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
but
overall
a
decent
pale
finishes
a
little
dirty
easy
drinking
for
a
day
outside
overlooking
the
water
overall
a
nice
offering
from
atlanta
but
terrapins
pale
ale
is
more
enjoyable
it
was
good
to
have
tried
another
brew
from
this
southern
brewery
o
pleasant
beer
im
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
one
out
but
as
far
as
an
easydrinking
sessionable
beer
in
a
six
pack
im
glad
to
have
them
around
if
they
would
can
this
it
would
be
perfect
to
take
golfing
o
good
session
beer
ipa
o
easy
drinker
i
could
have
another
2
of
these
probably
not
hoppy
enough
to
make
it
a
go
to
a
nice
session
beer
though
sweetwater
420
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
an
excellent
head
the
aroma
is
a
muted
grain
and
citrus
affair
420
fairs
much
better
on
the
tongue
with
a
mellow
citrus
hop
over
grainy
malts
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fuller
than
expected
and
the
drinkability
is
great
420
is
just
an
excellent
beer
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
its
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
firm
sharp
but
not
overpowering
bitterness
right
up
front
that
lasts
through
the
finish
but
tapers
off
nicely
bright
flavors
on
this
orange
peel
and
rind
tangerine
a
little
grassy
and
earthy
too
in
the
mid
palate
fresh
bread
holds
this
beer
up
well
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
body
make
this
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
its
smooth
refreshing
and
well
balanced
the
penultimate
atlanta
summer
porchswing
beer
goes
down
like
water
packs
a
nice
flavor
profile
very
good
beer
a
nice
brew
to
find
in
an
airport
packed
with
heineken
it
looks
nice
but
if
i
were
trying
this
blind
the
nose
would
certainly
not
lead
me
to
believe
it
was
an
apa
very
muted
with
a
mild
malt
and
sweet
tone
there
that
is
just
odd
flavor
is
not
too
bad
hearty
but
not
brash
i
consider
this
an
old
school
apa
you
know
old
school
as
in
6
years
ago
before
we
went
for
palate
obliteration
and
all
its
easy
to
drink
and
nice
id
be
interested
in
trying
it
on
cask
as
it
strikes
me
as
more
english
than
american
in
style
who
could
resist
a
beer
named
420
its
always
420
somewhere
honestly
this
beer
is
born
to
be
mild
nothing
about
it
just
jumps
out
and
grabs
you
it
pours
up
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
beautiful
off
white
3
finger
head
elaborate
and
lasting
rings
of
lacing
can
be
observed
as
the
glass
empties
the
smell
is
so
subtle
that
my
nonsensitive
nose
could
barely
pick
anything
up
taste
is
sort
of
grapefruity
and
sweet
with
not
much
hoppiness
on
the
finish
still
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
as
it
is
very
drinkable
if
lacking
distinction
m
light
body
somewhat
creamy
moderate
carbonation
mediocre
at
best
is
better
suited
as
a
college
aged
hipster
beer
thats
the
market
for
this
beer
and
the
brewery
and
they
found
it
theyre
afraid
if
they
change
it
they
will
lose
the
hipster
crowd
that
consumes
this
its
not
horrible
but
it
could
be
better
spend
the
extra
money
and
get
some
dales
pale
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
the
420
its
not
bad
but
its
not
one
my
top
fav
list
either
the
beer
poured
golden
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
mildly
the
smell
is
more
english
hop
than
the
pinefruit
west
coast
hops
the
taste
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
was
a
slight
balance
of
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
drinkable
and
worth
a
shot
o
a
very
smooth
sessionable
pale
ale
o
not
bursting
with
complexity
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
perfect
for
quaffing
on
a
warm
summer
day
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
offering
the
taste
is
tangy
slightly
lemony
with
subtle
malt
tinge
which
is
slightly
toasted
with
some
floral
hop
tastes
which
verge
on
tealike
with
light
astringency
and
nice
creamy
element
from
the
yeast
in
the
background
i
was
happy
to
try
this
as
it
is
a
drinkable
pale
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
having
this
again
im
extremely
dissapointed
in
the
way
the
beer
looks
however
this
is
a
really
good
tasting
beer
and
taste
is
what
counts
the
most
id
recommend
it
to
all
my
friends
provided
they
have
a
blindfold

overall
beer
fit
the
moment
on
the
beach
decent
hopmalt
balance
remarkable
only
in
its
unremarkability
avoid
this
one
overall
an
easy
to
drink
ipa
great
hop
character
but
not
overly
complex
i
order
it
at
restaurants
as
a
beer
i
know
it
will
be
good
notes
i
dont
have
access
to
sweetwater
often
and
i
regard
their
ipa
highly
this
apa
on
the
other
hand
it
feels
rather
poor
the
packaging
date
is
still
right
but
sure
enough
there
could
be
an
issue
with
the
freshness
of
this
sixpack
who
knows
in
this
incarnation
is
something
that
i
would
not
care
to
repeat
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
some
really
nice
sweet
hop
flavors
but
the
overall
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
cream
ale
o
good
brew
here
and
a
solid
apa
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
perfect
not
to
impressed
with
this
one
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brew
easy
enough
to
have
several
of
in
one
sitting
but
still
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
decent
character
i
would
classify
this
as
a
goto
beer
for
an
afternoon
of
relaxation
after
work
it
would
easily
stand
up
to
wings
or
fried
foods
o
overall
this
beer
is
far
from
bad
but
does
nothing
great
it
is
a
creamy
pale
ale
for
those
who
have
the
palette
for
it
but
i
cannot
recommend
it
to
those
who
have
adept
taste
buds
do
pretty
quaffable
one
step
above
bmc
really
giving
this
one
a
bump
because
of
drinkability
overall
it
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
no
major
flaws
o
pretty
good
pale
ale
but
nothing
stands
out
could
drink
a
few
pretty
easily
at

just

not
was
a

accompaniment
to
my

not

to

disappointed
drink
a
very

beer
with

paired
with

nevada
is
available
just
about
anywhere
this
will
always
stand
behind
it
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
spectacular
nice
aroma
but
the
taste
could
use
a
little
more
depth
not
bad
if
get
the
chance
to
try
it
but
there
are
better
pale
ales
to
have
regularly
overall
this
beer
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
i
want
to
drink
a
bunh
of
these

bottled
dated

by

poured
to
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
12
finger
white
head
with
virtually
no
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
rather
mild
more
of
a
sweet
crystal
malt
presence
than
hops
which
is
odd
considering
the
name
of
the
beer
hints
of
earthy
hops
but
mostly
malty
nose
the
flavor
is
more
inviting
than
the
nose
lets
on
a
gentle
blend
of
crystal
malt
with
a
light
earthy
bitter
together
with
a
fruity
sweetness
nothing
is
all
that
pronounced
rather
well
balanced
a
mild
bitterness
and
lingering
fruity
character
remain
on
the
tongue
light
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
overall
a
treat
to
try
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
on
name
and
label
alone
i
know
its
won
some
awards
so
it
was
nice
to
try
not
earth
shattering
but
solid
a
better
than
average
american
pale
ale
and
i
would
have
another
overall
a
drinkable
beer
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
overall
a
good
refreshing
pale
ale
this
is
a
nice
version
of
a
pale
ale
well
balanced
a
great
summertime
lawnmower
beer
overall
i
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
walking
through
an
airport
in
an
area
not
necessarily
known
for
brewing
i
happen
upon
this
tasty
little
treat
brewed
right
there
in
atlanta
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
and
i
will
drink
it
again
next
time
im
in
the
atl
o
the
sweetness
impairs
drinkability
otherwise
this
would
probably
be
a
decent
summer
beer
at
least
if
the
abv
were
lower
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
is
behind
their
ipa
to
me
if
this
were
a
point
lower
in
abv
the
taste
would
make
a
bit
more
sense
to
me
overall
a
decent
beer
but
far
from
sweetwaters
best
effort
however
this
could
sit
next
to
other
mainstream
craft
beers
as
an
approachable
gateway
beer
o
i
probably
drink
2
pale
ales
a
year
and
this
one
is
likely
the
best
ive
had
while
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
me
cant
wait
to
try
their
420
ipa
o
one
of
my
favorites
if
not
my
favorite
selection
from
sweetwater
brewery
a
very
good
beer
to
pair
with
the
food
offering
at
harpers
a
nice
pale
ale
from
the
boys
in
atlanta
overall
i
had
no
issues
drinking
it
and
would
drink
it
again
a
must
try
a
solid
enough
beer
if
not
my
favorite
in
the
sweetwater
stable
essentially
this
is
a
transition
beer
and
in
that
sense
it
provides
a
nice
entry
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
for
many
a
drinker
it
serves
as
a
better
alternative
than
many
another
possibility
for
this
role
fairly
light
all
around
with
a
modicum
of
bitterness
especially
at
the
finish
crisp
pleasant
good
lawnmower
beer
with
a
bit
more
hops
and
character
than
the
usual
for
the
task
fairly
dry
and
with
a
snappy
finish
serves
its
purpose
hands
down
this
is
just
a
great
pale
ale
with
great
balance
and
goes
down
easy
dont
float
the
mainstream
o
some
upsides
and
some
downsides
render
this
about
par
for
the
style
o
i
dont
know
if
people
outside
of
georgia
know
the
impact
this
beer
has
had
in
our
state
it
is
one
of
the
most
widely
drank
beers
here
and
has
played
a
huge
role
in
pulling
people
away
from
budmillercoors
im
not
saying
its
the
best
there
is
but
its
pretty
damn
good
and
has
to
be
the
most
common
gateway
beer
here
it
was
definitely
one
of
mine
overall
a
nice
light
refreshing
pale
ale
with
a
big
dose
of
citrus
most
definitely
couldwould
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
brew
ill
never
forget
my
first
run
in
with
sweetwater
420
i
was
at
a
outdoor
summer
concert
in
hotlanta
the
temperature
was
high
enough
to
melt
steel
the
opening
bands
sucked
and
the
only
beer
i
could
find
was
coors
light
in
24oz
cans
shameful
i
know
i
wouldnt
wash
my
feet
in
that
shit
now
but
then
later
while
the
main
band
was
playing
slayer
i
found
a
beer
kiosk
that
was
in
the
process
of
closing
and
they
only
had
sweetwater
420
the
guy
poured
me
the
beeron
the
freaking
house
because
he
had
already
closed
the
register
or
somethingand
i
thought
i
was
the
luckiest
man
on
earth
i
was
blown
away
after
the
first
sip
this
is
great
stuff
but
imagine
what
it
tasted
like
after
a
hot
day
drinking
nothing
but
coors
light
overall
a
good
but
not
great
pale
ale
with
some
interesting
flavors
like
red
wine
and
red
berries
that
ive
never
gotten
in
a
pale
ale
before
overall
this
beer
is
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
without
being
overpowering
it
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
any
tailgating
session
since
it
wont
destroy
your
tastebuds
for
a
wide
variety
of
foods
however
if
you
want
a
really
flavorful
more
assertive
pale
ale
to
drink
and
enjoy
id
suggest
a
sierra
nevada
it
is
superior
possibly
cheaper
and
more
easily
found
pours
a
clear
golden
brown
with
one
finger
of
white
head
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
rings
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
biscuit
malt
a
bit
of
pine
and
citrus
slightly
bitter
on
the
aftertaste
but
not
that
intense
overall
a
good
pale
ale
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
ive
had
420
many
times
it
is
one
of
my
staple
beers
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
perpetually
inviting
excellent
for
warm
summer
days
and
the
beach
it
is
an
excellent
extra
pale
ale
with
an
above
average
flavor
and
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
perfect
for
the
thirsty
soul
enjoy
would
i
buy
again
sure
not
a
bad
beer
with
food
would
i
plunk
down
8
bucks
for
a
6
maybe
overall
not
bad
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
boom
but
we
can
live
with
that
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
lacking
on
the
hops
too
malty
drinkability
is
moderate
overall
a
solid
pale
d
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
its
not
completely
pleasant
pretty
watered
down
and
very
subdued
in
flavor
definitely
not
comparable
to
a
west
coast
ipa
and
definitely
a
little
disappointing
a
sweetwater
beer
for
ya
though
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
that
has
a
nice
finish
that
contributes
to
a
very
good
drinkability
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
that
would
hold
up
well
in
session
not
a
standout
but
more
than
drinkable
and
an
enjoyable
brew
welldone
o
an
okay
apa
but
nothing
particularly
special
not
on
par
with
their
ipa
overall
its
not
bad
but
the
flavor
profile
is
very
light
for
an
apa
its
inoffensive
and
drinkable
but
hardly
pushing
the
envelope
for
the
style
overall
a
solid
drinkable
sessionable
pale
ale
with
a
little
extra
oomph
very
enjoyable

to

really
not

there
was

category
that
i
was
actually
impressed
with

was

color
with

that
rapidly
dissipated
a

a
undernote
of

well
it
was
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
i
expected
and
a
bit
sweet
at
first
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
to
make
it
crisp
overall
this
was
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
very
well
balanced
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
but
very
easy
drinking
very
well
balanced
drinkability
a
good
but
not
great
pale
ale
this
has
everything
one
could
ask
for
in
a
beer
of
its
style
but
doesnt
offer
much
to
truly
set
it
apart
this
is
a
versatile
beer
that
can
go
with
a
good
variety
of
foods
though
and
is
common
here
in
pensacola
and
makes
for
a
good
goto
beer
o
solid
beer
id
much
rather
prefer
the
sweetwater
ipa
but
this
is
a
nice
apa
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
while
in
savannah
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
ive
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
sweetwater
id
love
to
be
able
to
pick
their
offerings
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
thinnish
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
smells
of
sweet
grainy
malt
orange
and
citrus
round

fairly
mediocre

taste
is
sweet
grainy
malt
with
lots
of
orange
zest
type
flavors
earthy
with
hints
of
lemon
different
but
not
bad
medium
body
light
to
medium
carbonation
with
a
sweet
almost
watery
mouthfeel
nothing
objectionable
here
but
certainly
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
if
it
were
a
hundred
degrees
out
this
might
make
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
o
delicious
and
refreshing
great
flavor
and
very
enjoyable
delicious
flavorful
potent
but
not
overhopped
or
too
malty
its
really
well
balanced
light
and
flavorful
hits
all
the
right
notes
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
try
this
a
few
times
and
i
love
it
every
time
damn
good
pours
a
transluscent
golden
straw
color
with
about
a
half
inch
of
foamy
white
head
head
dissipates
quickly
but
does
leave
a
bit
of
lacing
on
its
way
out
smells
of
grains
a
bit
of
lemon
some
faint
hops
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
orange
beyond
that
smell
is
a
bit
watery
though
still
inviting
for
a
pale
tastes
similar
but
is
very
balanced
a
bit
more
hop
character
is
noticeable
in
the
middle
and
there
is
a
faint
alcohol
presence
near
the
end
which
seems
odd
still
the
rest
of
the
flavors
are
balanced
phenomenally
and
lend
some
additional
refreshment
to
the
drink
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
pretty
typical
of
a
pale
overall
a
solid
offering
that
im
sure
i
would
revisit
were
i
in
the
area
dark
gold
pour
with
a
thin
white
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
lots
of
bready
malts
accented
by
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
hops
flavor
is
sort
of
doughy
and
a
little
sweet
just
a
very
slight
bitterness
but
there
is
a
lot
of
citrus
flavor
in
there
palate
is
smooth
and
biggerbodied
than
the
abv
would
indicate
i
wasnt
expecting
much
based
on
others
ratings
but
this
one
impressed
me
probably
not
as
bitter
as
a
traditional
pale
ale
but
very
drinkable
good
sessiontype
beer
overall
i
feel
that
the
420
and
the
blue
though
the
flagship
beers
are
overall
mediocre
this
is
a
nice
halfway
between
an
ipa
and
apa
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
overall
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
and
the
finish
was
way
too
slick
dont
really
feel
the
need
to
have
another
overall
in
general
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
however
definitely
not
my
favorite
apa
with
that
said
would
i
have
more
of
this
again
absolutely
judging
from
the
best
by
date
it
wasnt
exactly
very
fresh
but
it
was
still
good
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
hoppier
pale
ales
3
5s
across
the
board
o
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
or
night
this
would
be
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
regularly
if
easily
available
to
me
the
flavor
is
citrusy
and
floral
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
grainy
malts
this
is
a
light
bodied
well
balanced
beer
that
is
moderately
carbonated
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
disappointed
and
will
not
try
again
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
not
too
high
in
the
hops
but
it
is
rather
dangerous
as
it
is
a
good
session
beer
ive
had
hundreds
of
these
and
honestly
this
particular
review
is
strange
since
it
tastes
a
bit
different
than
it
usually
does
ill
have
to
update
this
next
time
i
crack
open
another
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
bright
orangegold
coloring
with
no
head
the
beer
almost
glows
in
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
muddled
fruit
sweetness
with
a
slight
citrus
note
also
but
more
cloying
characteristics
than
anything
slight
hopping
helps
to
balance
everything
the
beer
is
very
sharp
and
crisp
in
mouth
flavors
are
slightly
smoked
but
very
tart
and
bitter
citrus
also
with
an
overpowered
hops
presence
a
little
too
lopsided
for
me
the
aftertaste
is
very
watery
with
slight
pepperyhops
hints
throughout
the
finish
is
dry
but
lingers
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
can
certainly
kick
back
and
enjoy
without
having
to
think
too
much
about
it
pretty
good
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
retains
and
laced
well
the
aroma
has
hints
of
breadcaramel
malt
and
hops
but
they
were
fairly
weak
the
taste
starts
malty
sweet
with
the
typical
hints
of
bread
and
caramel
and
then
finishes
with
some
complex
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
balanced
and
finishes
clean
overall
a
good
pale
ale
overall
wow
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
this
was
a
great
beer
for
a
lazy
afternoon
chillin
grillin
poolside
at
the
tiki
bar
wish
i
could
get
around
here
overall
a
great
beer
i
really
like
it
wood
definitely
look
for
it
if
they
distributed
here
o
i
thought
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
gave
a
little
extra
to
the
flavor
the
abv
is
lighter
which
means
you
can
drink
this
in
the
summertime
while
grilling
and
we
all
love
to
grill
d
very
good
extra
pale
ale
i
see
a
lot
of
the
reviews
here
saying
it
was
dull
dont
believe
them
this
brew
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
o
i
liked
this
brew
great
summer
drinking
beer
nothing
really
special
about
it
but
still
a
decent
brew
o
overall
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
i
like
it
and
on
a
hot
atlanta
day
this
beer
is
an
excellent
choice
smooth
and
clean
flavors
that
work
well
with
each
other
i
will
gladly
take
another
o
not
bad
not
impressive
either
pretty
good
one
of
those
beers
i
enjoy
enough
to
drink
and
the
gf
likes
em
too
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
and
i
could
easily
lose
track
of
how
many
ive
had
taste
of
more
hops
than
what
i
got
in
the
aroma
citrus
grassy
notes
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
some
light
hoppy
notes
mouthfeel
was
heavier
than
expecting
from
an
extra
pale
ale
but
im
not
complaining
overall
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
this
apa
and
wish
i
could
get
this
locally
overalli
wish
i
had
access
to
this
beer
because
when
in
the
mood
for
a
creamy
smooth
refreshing
brew
this
would
be
perfect
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
by
any
means
but
really
enjoyed
it
note
this
bottle
had
a
best
by
date
of
41411
but
due
to
circumstances
i
was
not
able
to
try
it
until
now
i
may
try
to
get
another
bottle
and
if
my
opinion
changes
ill
update
my
review
o
an
excellent
apa
a
prime
example
of
the
style
oone
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
style
good
paired
with
almost
any
food
flavorful
but
still
refreshing
taste
is
crisp
and
hoppy
a
bit
grassy
like
their
ipa
but
obviously
to
much
lesser
extent
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
with
some
sharp
carbonation
on
the
finish
overall
much
improved
fresh
and
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
that
had
travelled
a
ways
to
get
to
my
glass
its
a
decent
pale
ale
that
lingers
somewhere
between
ipa
and
apa
it
might
be
better
served
to
make
up
its
mind
worth
a
try
cheers

edit
i
got
a
fresher
bottle
that
had
a
best
buy
date
june
30th
2012
this
is
much
better
fresher
since
the
hops
are
more
vibrant
and
havent
faded
but
i
did
find
the
carbonation
to
a
be
a
little
fizzy
so
i
am
going
to
adjust
the
scores
accordingly
i
liked
this
beer
its
a
really
solid
american
pale
ale
d
very
drinkable
but
somewhat
lacking
in
interesting
characteristics
overall
an
outstanding
session
brew
one
of
my
goto
beers
in
the
summertime
d
very
drinkable
flavorful
smooth
and
balanced
this
is
one
of
my
goto
pale
ales
when
i
cant
find
anything
else
to
drink
nice
looking
pale
perfect
color
for
a
xpa
the
smell
is
nice
and
hoppy
the
taste
follows
the
smell
citrus
hop
pale
with
and
very
nice
finish
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
standard
to
drink
when
there
is
nothing
else
exciting
on
tap
its
a
welldone
execution
on
a
wellknown
beer
style
a
light
crisp
pale
ale
not
super
hoppy
fairly
sweet
better
as
it
warms
o
mehhh
at
best
d
a
classic
very
high
drinkability
tasty
and
very
smooth
pour
me
another
d
4
despite
not
being
crazy
good
in
any
one
area
i
feel
i
could
drink
several
of
these
it
goes
down
easily
and
has
a
good
enough
aroma
and
taste
it
is
balanced
id
imagine
it
would
be
even
better
fresh
off
the
line
or
on
draft
a
refreshing
easytodrink
brew
thats
worth
a
shot
still
like
i
said
this
is
a
damn
fine
standby
o
not
too
bad
id
like
to
try
more
sweetwater
though
for
a
pale
ale
extra
pale
this
isnt
too
shabby
i
dont
need
to
seek
this
out
again
actively
though
i
could
grab
it
at
a
bar
once
in
a
while
if
something
else
doesnt
spark
my
interest
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
easy
drinking
overall
mild
hoppiness
mild
bitterness
mild
overall
its
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
dry
at
the
end
decent
overall
i
got
this
as
a
single
for
around
3
bucks
and
as
a
single
not
worth
it
as
for
local
pales
of
better
quality
being
around
32
a
case
with
tax
this
beer
will
most
likely
not
be
purchased
in
the
near
future
still
a
great
beer
overall
that
the
locals
can
appreciate
the
cpj
a
good
x
pale
ale
od
easy
drinking
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
abv
is
very
manageable
somewhat
filling
very
nice
taste
a
crowded
style
but
very
drinkable
a
hint
of
astringency
takes
away
points
but
over
all
nice
pale
i
could
have
another
citrus
comes
through
as
to
style
mellow
malt
character
and
subtle
hops
clean
pour
it
was
lighter
in
body
than
expected
so
that
made
it
drinkable
thanks
to
flying
saucer
raleigh
nc
overall
not
a
bad
ale
just
not
true
to
its
style
i
finished
this
beer
quickly
while
most
apas
in
the
past
are
fuller
bodied
and
have
more
hop
to
them
im
not
going
to
bash
this
beer
but
is
sure
isnt
my
favorite
it
has
a
crisp
front
end
and
good
carbonation
o
i
dont
ever
see
myself
getting
this
again
it
taste
sort
of
ammature
the
nose
flavor
is
weak
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
watery
if
it
was
a
little
more
hop
forward
then
maybe
i
would
get
it
but
for
now
ill
pass
i
feel
like
maybe
this
would
be
better
if
it
were
fresh
out
the
tank
or
just
on
tap
it
needs
something
to
it
its
an
average
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
atlanta
i
thought
i
should
try
some
of
the
local
brew
i
found
sweetwater
to
be
quite
easy
to
find
around
town
with
a
good
variety
of
beers
so
i
picked
up
a
few
6packs
including
this
one
i
think
of
all
the
sweetwater
brews
i
tried
this
was
the
best
it
had
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
a
well
rounded
crisp
finish
a
nice
fruity
aroma
also
carried
through
in
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
local
beer
and
if
you
find
yourself
near
atlanta
i
would
get
this
one
before
others
from
this
company
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
dont
really
like
the
hop
balance
that
much
because
it
is
quite
bitter
for
the
gravity
and
the
grassy
hops
are
too
dominant
i
have
a
bottle
of
their
regular
ipa
so
i
have
higher
hopes
for
that
one
since
it
is
a
little
bigger
this
hopping
schedule
may
be
ok
for
a
7
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
much
for
a
5
4
beer
great
name
though
o
drinkable
american
pale
ale
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
would
order
it
again
d
good
beer
i
will
defiantly
be
getting
this
again
d
super
easy
to
drink
id
grab
this
again
if
i
could
find
it
notes
this
pale
ale
screams
summer
time
cookouts
and
picnics
m
crisp
medium
body
and
carbonation
d
very
delicious
and
for
me
a
session
beer
as
the
abv
is
low
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
apa
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
yet
satisfying
if
you
only
have
time
for
one
i
like
this
and
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
another
one
although
i
probably
wont
stock
it
in
my
fridge
this
was
actually
an
old
bottle
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
little
apa
nothing
flashy
but
very
well
crafted
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
finally
got
to
try
it
after
the
couple
times
i
have
been
down
south
and
have
passed
it
up
md
honestly
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
summer
long
it
would
be
a
great
brew
for
a
nice
hot
day
its
light
and
goes
down
smooth
quenches
the
thirst
i
actually
had
this
brew
originally
at
bonnaroo
music
and
arts
festival
2010
it
was
an
amazing
brew
to
have
in
the
middle
of
hot
june
it
is
not
distributed
here
in
kansas
so
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
come
by
frequently
overall
sweetwater
brewing
has
a
great
beer
an
the
table
d
sweetwater
calculated
this
one
perfectly
a
cross
between
a
pilsener
and
a
hoppy
ipa
something
the
masses
will
enjoy
i
guess
its
tough
to
argue
with
that
d
ok
not
a
big
fan
dnot
bad
bit
not
the
greatest
d
ehh
its
ok
tastes
ok
and
not
too
heavy
but
its
not
something
i
really
truly
enjoy
pours
a
very
clear
light
yellow
lots
of
white
head
smells
hoppy
and
hempy
a
very
unusual
smell
reminds
me
of
weed
tastes
very
mellow
and
hoppy
not
really
anything
impressive
good
mouthfeel
and
solid
drinkability
but
overall
not
an
impressive
beer
just
a
solid
ipa
good
beer
overall
a
solid
apa
here
that
i
would
drink
again
all
in
all
dont
worry
about
this
one
its
decent
but
not
much
above
that
at
all
i
need
an
alpha
king
now
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
a
fan
of
this
particular
rendition
of
an
apa
i
can
appreciate
good
balance
and
not
going
all
out
with
the
hop
bitterness
so
this
is
one
id
recommend
especially
to
those
who
arent
extreme
hopheads
d
i
can
put
a
sixer
of
this
back
in
no
time
particularly
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
is
the
beer
that
really
got
me
started
in
the
craft
beer
direction
so
i
admit
im
slightly
biased
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
tasting
pale
ale
this
is
your
beer
this
poured
light
orange
and
had
one
finger
of
head
that
didnt
last
this
was
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
hops
and
floral
come
out
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
little
more
malty
than
other
pale
ales
that
ive
testy
which
is
nice
for
a
change
it
relatively
light
bodied
making
it
easy
to
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
making
yourself
feel
like
a
sausage
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
has
slightly
higher
carbonation
which
makes
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
day
i
cant
think
of
a
more
sessionable
ale
sweetwater
420
extra
pale
ale
from
sweetwater
brewing
company
pours
light
golden
in
my
pint
glass
perfect
carbonation
is
present
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
malts
the
taste
is
of
hops
malt
and
citrus
this
beer
wont
slap
you
in
the
face
with
harshness
its
a
pale
ale
and
it
does
its
job
well
very
high
drinkability
makes
me
come
back
for
more
leaves
lacing
in
my
glass
i
like
to
think
of
this
pale
ale
as
a
sweetwater
ipa
light
pours
a
pretty
light
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of

of
piney
hops
caramel

a
little
citrus

of
mild

bitterness
caramel
yeast
bread
and
maybe
some
hints
of
orange
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
i
really
like
this
one
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
quite
refreshing
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
very
drinkable
but
somewhat
lacking
in
interesting
characteristics
drinkability
fairly
refreshing
d
overall

is

a
try

with
a
slight
sweetness
after
each
sip

a
bit
extreme
on
this
bottle
could
be
toned
down
a
notch
slick
oily
and
fairly
light
mouthfeel
as
well
overall
drinkability
is
about
average
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
in
this
beer
how
is
it
that
sierra
nevada
and
boulevard
have
20
year
old
pale
ale
recipes
that
completely
outclass
this
offering
from
sweetwater
420
is
not
terrible
beer
but
it
is
boring
at
least
with
some
bad
beers
you
can
say
well
they
tried
for
something
big
and
they
happened
to
fail
with
420
all
one
can
say
is
they
tried
to
play
it
as
safe
as
possible
and
still
failed
slightly
below
average
beer
but
still
an
embarrassment
d
solid
beer
good
everyday
sessionable
pale
ale
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
malty
sweetness
for
the
long
haul
at
least
to
my
tastes
but
definitely
a
beer
that
you
can
settle
in
with
for
an
afternoon
and
have
a
few
best
before
11110
pours
a
nice
golden

citrusy

upfront
along
with
biscuit
caramel
fruity

notes
orange
peel
fruity

and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
and
drinkability
is

good
this
one
is
a
pretty
tasty
yet
simple
apa
when
fresh
but
thoroughly
mediocre
when
the
hops
fade
overall
no
born
on
date
but
it
did
have
an
expiration
date
of
122610
very
unusual
flavor
that
sets
it
apart
and
makes
it
unique
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
if
youre
ever
forced
to
be
in
the
state
of
georgia
im
sure
this
beer
would
have
been
even
better
without
the
ice
cold
beer
mug
why
do
restaurants
serve
everything
like
it
is
coors
light
d
a
decent
apa
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
not
a
lot
stands
out
in
the
smell
or
taste
but
not
bad
at
all
would
try
again
and
have
no
problem
drinking
the
3
that
came
to
me
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
too
complex
and
flavorful
a
good
grillinglawnmower
beer
compared
to
say
mission
st
pale
ale
available
locally
for
5
99
and
sometimes
less
a
six
pack
at
trader
joes
this
pales
pun
intended
by
comparison
dgoes
down
easily
enough
it
just
doesnt
entice
me
to
have
another
pours
a
fairly
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
pretty
strong
pine
floral
and
citrus
hops
that
work
well
together
in
tandem
the
taste
lays
off
a
bit
with
some
mild
hop
flavors
and
a
bit
of
pale
malt
below
light
feel
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
pale
ale
with
some
nice
characteristics
all
around
this
ale
pours
a
hazygold
with
a
white
head
there
is
not
a
real
big
aroma
mild
hops
with
maltiness
hint
of
some
citrus
lemon
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
mild
malt
and
a
bitter
hoppiness
kind
of
bready
decent
beer
worth
trying
it
out
and
drinking
a
couple
d
this
is
very
sessionable
and
refreshing
the
head
on
this
beer
was
not
very
impressive
about
a
finger
of
soap
suds
looking
bubbles
the
color
rates
a
6
on
the
srm
chart
impressive
for
a
apa
smell
of
lemon
lime
grapefruit
baked
wheat
and
spices
well
balanced
flavor
of
citrus
fruit
malt
and
grains
nice
bite
on
my
tongue
and
upper
palate
sort
of
a
velvet
smooth
feeling
as
it
slides
down
my
throat
this
beer
goes
well
with
fish
and
fries
as
well
as
with
snacks
good
price
i
will
have
some
more
of
this
in
the
future
aftertaste
has
a
nice
sharp
finish
with
some
pine
citrus
and
light
fruity
esters
left
on
the
palate
splendid
a
little
disappointing
but
very
quaffable
in
quantity
and
likeable
in
its
own
way
this
one
is
light
in
body
with
fairly
low
carbonation
for
a
pale
ale
and
the
finish
is
rather
watery
this
is
an
inoffensive
example
of
a
pale
ale
that
i
could
drink
all
day
if
it
was
on
hand
but
its
certainly
not
what
i
would
reach
for
if
i
wanted
something
interesting
and
exciting
my
new
go
to
apa
and
excited
they
come
to
jax

week

the
beers
fault
it
does
have
a
best
by
date
of
41910
and
its
september
now
pale
malts
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
just
a
hint
of
lightly
toasted
malt
are
all
present
tastes
like
it
smells
rather
unremarkable
the
aforementioned
smells
are
accurately
translated
into
corresponding
flavors
with
some
hop
bitterness
for
balance
but
not
much
flavor
again
this
is
probably
not
the
beers
fault
mouthfeel
is
a
fullmedium
bodied
beer
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
not
impressive
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
within
its
freshness
range
if
it
is
anything
like
their
ipa
im
sure
its
great
d
not
outstanding
but
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
very
citrusy
hop
flavors
abound
in
this
beer
it
seems
rather
hoppy
and
unbalanced
for
an
apa
i
suppose
this
is
the
extra
in
the
title
it
has
a
certain
sweetness
to
it
that
meshes
really
well
with
the
hop
character
but
doesnt
really
temper
the
hop
flavors
with
a
malty
balance
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
the
apa
as
well
as
a
very
crisp
and
sessionable
beer
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
find
yourself
in
the
southern
states
that
sweetwater
distributes
to
drinkability
wonderful
beer
for
summertime
sipping
d
this
was
the
perfect
companion
for
exploring
the
savannah
historic
district
during
july
whenever
you
fell
parched
you
can
walk
into
pretty
much
any
bar
and
pick
up
a
pint
to
go
it
doesnt
have
quite
as
much
character
as
snpa
to
me
but
its
still
very
good
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
very
easy
drinking
a
bit
hoppy
for
some
mayhap
but
good
overall
the
citrus
characteristics
are
prominant
but
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
selection
apa
d
this
is
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
finally
found
a
420
extra
pale
ale
really
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
possible
will
become
my
pale
ale
of
choice
when
travelling
in
the
south
where
it
seems
to
be
widely
available
420s
the
flagship
and
pretty
representative
of
sweetwaters
approach
to
their
market
sweetwater
seems
to
have
brewed
420
with
safety
in
mind
safety
in
that
the
average
person
could
easily
handle
the
beer
without
being
overwhelmed
nothing
wrong
with
that
of
course
not
bad
but
420
hasnt
swayed
me
from
their
excellent
ipa
d
kind
of
a
letdown
but
maybe
those
were
my
expectations
at
work
i
thought
it
would
be
a
really
solid
pale
ale
like
terrapins
rye
pa
but
this
seems
like
a
lager
targeted
toward
the
macro
crowd
skip
notes
i
slightly
prefer
this
ontap
but
otherwise
pretty
even
i
personally
think
that
this
beer
deserves
better
numbers
d
overall
this
a
good
pale
ale
positive
recommendation
d
very
drinkable
beer
all
the
flavors
blend
well
and
make
for
a
great
summer
sipping
beer
a
nice
beer
with
a
good
long
bitterness
super
easy
drinking
this
is
a
quality
session
beer
i
just
hope
tampa
gets
distrobution
soon
i
dont
like
having
to
drive
m
medium
body
no
warming
on
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
beer
we
used
to
drink
this
stuff
in
college
all
the
time
go
dawgs
and
its
nice
to
try
it
again
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
this
6pack
and
will
stock
up
next
time
i
head
to
the
deep
south
its
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
surprising
here
but
a
nice
drinkability
the
420
pale
ale
pours
an
orange
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
nice
pillowy
white
head
and
some
retention
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
the
nose
with
very
subtle
hop
characteristics
citrus
fruits
are
faint
but
present
taste
is
water
downed
and
some
hints
of
malts
and
pines
smell
is
much
more
dominating
than
the
quaff
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
not
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
not
much
complexity
or
taste
to
it
this
has
failed
to
impress
me
again
stay
away
from
it
if
it
isnt
fresh
as
it
tends
to
skunk
pretty
easily
i
must
say
their
ipa
is
killer
though
the
flavor
is
a
present
but
mellow
hop
profile
which
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
smell
bitter
herbal
hops
flow
into
a
sweeter
more
citrus
rind
like
taste
towards
the
end
of
the
profile
the
malt
really
rounds
out
the
flavor
by
creating
a
tasty
mild
and
sweet
base
in
the
end
this
is
a
better
apa
than
i
remember
it
being
and
kind
of
makes
me
feel
bad
for
always
going
for
the
aipa
but
o
well
a
well
made
and
tasty
brew
mouth
feel
leaves
me
satisfied
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
session
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
evening
nice
drink
overall
i
really
liked
it
at
first
and
then
i
kind
of
got
bored
with
it
the
taste
is
good
but
it
is
a
quite
average
beer
nothing
bad
really
might
have
been
a
b
if
that
harsh
earthen
finish
would
have
been
toned
down
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowlight
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
and
resiny
hops
the
flavor
is
grain
and
bready
malts
with
lots
of
hop
flavor
including
resiny
and
grassy
hops
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
this
is
solid
tasting
not
bad
could
session
this
without
any
problems
at
all
ive
been
running
into
alot
of
beers
lately
that
i
would
prefer
in
really
hot
weather
and
this
is
one
of
them
being
its
late
april
tis
the
season
for
these
types
of
brews
this
might
not
be
the
hoppiest
or
best
apa
but
it
is
still
a
solid
beer
and
is
very
enjoyable
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
a
friend
to
the
craft
beer
world
i
would
like
to
thank
sweetwater
brewing
company
for
having
their
420
pint
glass
giveaway
i
went
to
first
street
draught
house
to
enjoy
a
pint
and
get
my
free
glass
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
hope
to
drink
some
more
sweetwater
in
the
future
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
drinkability
is
still
topnotch
triple
ts
doesnt
have
the
best
beer
selection
in
town
but
im
completely
satisfied
as
long
as
they
continue
to
have
this
on
tap
i
had
a
few
the
other
night
and
never
got
tired
of
it
at
all
a
very
solid
beer
from
sweetwater
maybe
the
best
they
offer
this
is
a
mystery
ill
have
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
soon
d
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
quintessential
beers
in
the
south
and
i
can
see
why
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
but
a
real
easy
drinker
d
the
standard
bearer
for
southern
craft
brews
has
made
a
fan
out
of
me
this
isnt
a
go
crazy
hop
bomb
like
many
of
the
new
pales
are
trying
to
be
just
good
classic
american
pale
ale
nice
body
nice
feel
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
not
hopforward
like
many
apas
i
drink
a
good
bridge
beer
for
any
bmc
drinker
i
would
say
bring
a
sixpack
the
next
time
you
are
throwing
some
shoes
with
your
buddies
the
taste
sticks
giving
it
a
decent
mouthfeel
id
have
another
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
medium
effervescence
warming
in
the
throat
pretty
good
stuff
but
no
standout
d
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
satisfy
my
palette
a
good
late
afternoon
beer
i
am
not
horribly
disappointed
but
still
this
seems
to
be
a
very
average
extra
pale
ale
im
questioning
whats
extra
about
it
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
too
malty
and
not
balanced
well
in
the
hop
factor
not
a
horrible
beer
but
still
not
what
i
expected
good
entry
level
pale
ale
very
good
ale
i
had
it
tonight
on
the
wonderful
saint
pattys
day
at
a
bar
appearance
was
nice
with
a
foam
that
didnt
go
away
through
the
whole
the
whole
thing
smell
was
great
it
smelled
strong
of
hops
the
taste
was
very
good
with
a
true
taste
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
great
very
expectable
with
a
extra
pale
ale
it
has
a
great
drinkability
that
you
will
surely
enjoy
yet
again
the
atl
georgia
is
on
the
map
well
world
i
say
try
this
beer
the
taste
is
reasonably
complex
the
beer
begins
on
the
cracked
grain
dryish
side
with
a
nice
bready
mid
section
fairly
light
bodied
and
carbonated
somewhere
along
the
way
the
sweeter
malts
emerge
and
the
beer
finishes
up
a
bit
saltene
herbal
maybe
a
touch
of
cracked
graininess
the
beer
has
some
floral
tones
and
gives
you
some
drying
salty
notes
with
more
sweet
herbal
malts
the
beer
has
some
complexity
to
it
it
is
interesting
and
worthy
of
a
try
the
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
longer
than
i
normally
like
wonderfully
drinkable
and
overall
an
excellent
apa
a
staple
here
in
the
south
and
thats
just
fine
by
me
clean
crisp
medium
body
that
is
more
hop
forward
than
the
nose
leads
on
to
well
balanced
with
a
decent
amount
of
dry
earthy
pine
hops
that
linger
throughout
over
the
slight
tropicalcitrus
fruit
notes
and
a
sweet
caramelbiscuit
malt
backbone
into
a
dry
finish
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
would
purchase
it
again
no
doubt
taste
was
a
bit
more
complex
but
not
complex
by
any
means
both
some
malt
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
a
simple
fairly
ordinary
but
drinkable
apa
i
got
this
as
part
of
my
botmc
it
is
light
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
has
sweet
flowery
citrus
the
flavor
folows
the
nose
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
has
a
nice
sweet
finish
it
is
highly
carbonated
and
is
medium
in
body
a
solid
all
around
apa
drinkability
nicely
not
overfilling
light
yet
satisfying
would
have
another
overall
decent
sessional
but
nothing
i
would
actively
search
out
again
overall
i
think
i
like
this
beer
better
ontap
the
thickness
isnt
enough
to
support
such
low
carbonation
d
nonfilling
and
good
taste
make
this
a
decent
beer
to
drink
however
i
would
probably
want
something
else
after
about
my
2nd
one
the
bomc
description
was
on
the
mark
and
pointed
out
the
pepper
and
citrus
hop
taste
that
leads
to
the
sweet
malty
ending
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
went
down
very
easy
i
recommend
this
beer
d
this
is
a
beer
i
think
would
appeal
to
a
lot
of
people
and
can
be
refreshing
and
quaffed
with
ease
good
session
beer
for
sure
brought
this
bottle
back
to
cincinnati
after
a
long
weekend
in
gatlinburg
poured
a
yellow
clear
enough
that
i
can
read
ba
through
the
side
of
the
glass
plenty
of
head
that
dissapates
quickly
without
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
mainly
sweet
and
malty
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
the
moderately
hopped
taste
is
backed
up
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
that
gives
the
beer
a
realtively
thick
body
not
very
hoppy
at
all
for
being
an
apa
seems
like
its
more
mellow
taste
would
lend
itself
to
being
classofied
as
a
different
style
imo
there
are
many
better
pale
ales
in
the
world
and
a
good
bit
of
them
are
less
expensive
drinkability
solid
actually
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
during
the
warm
and
humid
summer
months
as
it
doesnt
weigh
heavily
on
the
stomach
at
all
and
the
body
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
dont
think
id
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
if
i
came
across
it
i
may
pick
up
a
sixer
here
or
there

a

that
leaves
a

i
could
have
four
in
a
sitting
a
solid
beer
note
i
later
tried
this
brew
from
the
bottle
and
everything
above
stays
mostly
the
same
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
simply
turned
down
a
notch
its
amazing
what
a
difference
ontap
makes
notes
my
favorite
session
beer
and
i
only
can
get
it
some
of
the
time
such
is
the
fate
of
a
ba
drinkability
is
pretty
good
smooth

refreshing
probably
great
for
cotton
mouth
if
i
was
not
on
a
mission
of
trying
as
many
bars
as
possible
i
would
have
had
another
i
think
if
i
had
this
at
a
beer
bar
with
a
better
pour
it
may
be
better
however
i
did
not
and
it
did
not
impress
me
at
all
i
will
try
this
again
i
think
the
restaurant
may
have
poorly
represented
this
beer
notes
id
rather
just
have
their
ipa
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
d
a
solid
but
not
outstanding
pale
ale
paired
well
with
a
plate
of
mildly
spiced
nachos
complex
yet
sessionable
this
is
one
worth
keeping
your
eyes
peeled
for
not
a
bad
beer
but
guess
im
hooked
on
the
big
beers
nice
food
beer
drinkability
a
nice
beer
and
if
they
sold
it
in
jackaonville
i
would
make
it
a
regular
session
beer
i
definitely
like
this
one
for
a
session
beer
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
and
a
good
stepping
stone
to
their
excellent
ipa
pours
a

pretty

unsurprising
hops
citrus

with

hops
citrus
decent
bitterness
not
overwhelmingly
so
but
definitely
there
probably
borderline
for
a
bmc
drinker
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
i
didnt
pick
up
on
the
wateriness
that
i
got
from
this
brew
in
the
bottle
drinkability
was
good
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
experience
it
wont
go
down
as
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
good
enough
to
order
at
a
restaurant
if
your
alternatives
are
bmc
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
density
and
carbonation
d
good
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
easily
not
a
beer
i
would
have
tried
but
i
recieved
as
an
extra
in

i
had
the

to
try

overall
a
decent
extra
pale

but
lack

drinkability
is
goodonly
because
it
is
so
easy
i
feel
like
this
is
an
english
pale
alehonestly
still
good
though
d
decent
i
could
go
for
a
session
with
this
beer
i
feel
like
its
an
ipa
that
a
few
of
my
bud
light
drinking
friends
could
warm
up
to
a
bright
amber
appearance
with
minimal
head
retention
and
lacing
not
much

a
little
bit

the

is
citrus
leaning
a
little
more
to
the
sweeter
orangelike
flavors
there
seems
to
be
a
lessacidic
fruit
flavor
in
there
somewhere
that
i
cant
quite
peg
maybe
a
raspberry
or
cranberry
or
apple
or
all
three
its
pleasant
at
any
rate
a
light

with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
kind
of
watery
to
be
honest
id
heard
a
great
deal
about
this
beer
so
i
expected
more
its
definitely
a
decent
session
beer
its
got
some
flavor
not
too
offensive
but
just
didnt
wow
me
d
pretty
damn
high
i
have
to
give
it
that
blows
the
one
with
drinkability
bud
light
overall
its
a
little
different
than
most
apas
ive
tried
it
is
an
extra
pale
ale
but
it
still
seems
pretty
mild
and
tamable
not
an
outstanding
brew
in
this
category
but
nothing
not
worth
sessioning
can
be
found
in
a
bottle
of
sweetwater
420
id
put
it
slightly
above
average
am
easy
to
put
down
apa
it
is
a
creamy
brew
with
medium
carbonation
that
could
be
a
session
beer
not
remarkable
but
enjoyable
overall
another
solid
beer
ben
sent
me
im
definitely
starting
to
like
this
whole
southerneast
coast
beer
scene
tasty
things
coming
from
that
part
of
the
country
for
sure
md
an
excellent
pale
ale
this
would
be
a
standby
if
i
could
regularly
get
it
the
taste
is
fairly
grainy
tworow
malts
there
is
a
nice
creamy
malt
backbone
and
a
light
hop
kick
on
the
end
a
nice
citrus
lemon
hop
flavor
not
as
balanced
as
some
of
the
better
extra
pale
ales
i
have
had
in
my
day
i
like
more
hops
so
this
one
kind
of
let
me
down
still
a
decent
offering
from
the
boys
dawn
soth
at
sweetwater
d
an
extremely
soild
brew
that
exceeded
my
expectations
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
a
local
favorite
and
staple
this
was
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
try
more
sweetwater
if
i
see
it
again
on
a
trip
to
georgia
give
this
brew
a
shot
if
youre
bumming
around
the
peach
state
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
definitely
very
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
well
balanced
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
it
could
use
a
little
more
malt
or
a
little
more
hops
a
little
more
of
both
or
just
a
little
more
of
somthing
it
lacks
a
strong
flavor
profile
and
isnt
very
complex
ok
drinkability
a
decent
exampple
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
not
to
heavy
but
still
very
flavorful
d
nice
flavor
and
balance
easily
sessionable
420
is
the
classic
for
me
cut
my
teeth
on
it
when
it
comes
to
craft
beer
and
it
will
always
have
a
spot
in
the
fridge
not
the
best
from
my
hometown
brewery
but
a
damn
good
beer
not
outstanding
but
pretty
good
in
an
airport
full
of
macros
its
a
welcome
alternative
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
but
ill
definitely
drink
it
when
its
available
this
is
a
solid
very
drinkable
pale
ale
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
but
its
an
easy
drinker
and
a
solid
option
when
other
options
are
few
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
while
in
atlanta
and
i
have
no
complaints
slight
hops
aroma
definately
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
balanced
decent
session
beer
no
alcohol
presense
detected
good
bitter
finish
decent
beer
would
drink
more
if
available
in
va
i
have
a
friend
who
thinks
sweetwater
makes
the
best
beer
on
earth
and
after
hearing
him
go
on
and
on
about
it
i
decided
i
would
give
this
a
try
im
going
to
recommend
him
try
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
for
the
style
i
feel
like
there
are
better
choices
that
said
if
you
like
american
pale
ales
this
is
worth
checking
out
maybe
youll
like
the
flavors
more
than
i
did
picked
up
a
sixer
the
other
day
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
light
copper
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aroma
is
of
floral
and
light
citrus
hops
taste
nothing
really
stands
out
there
is
a
light
touch
of
hops
a
little
peppery
and
a
faint
bit
of
maltiness
finish
is
pretty
light
with
no
real
lasting
flavors
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
little
oiliness
again
finish
is
pretty
uneventful
drinkability
is
up
there
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
this
is
on
tap
at
charlestons
minor
league
baseball
park
i
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
these
at
a
game
i
enjoyed
this
a
subtle
and
enjoyable
beer
something
i
would
recommend
very
drinkable
and
nicely
balanced
i
like
this
beer
it
is
not
overbearing
or
out
of
control
like
some
this
is
my
session
beer
if
i
had
to
pick
an
everyday
beer
this
would
be
it
it
pours
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
thins
out
while
leaving
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
not
very
overpowering
just
a
faint
hint
of
citrus
the
beer
is
straw
gold
with
great
clarity
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
balanced
bitterness
that
doesnt
overpower
the
malt
finishes
with
a
slight
aftertaste
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
come
back
for
seconds
cant
rate
this
one
too
high
on
drinkability
with
that
aftertaste
its
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
better
because
of
its
drinkability
i
had
this
outdoors
when
it
was
85
and
sunny
and
it
was
very
refreshing
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
was
greatit
was
easy
to
drown
in
these
had
a
lot
of
mass
appeal
as
even
my
girlfriend
loves
it
went
down
real
easy
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
while
still
having
enough
oomph
to
make
you
know
its
there
goes
down
easy
and
is
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
overall
a
solid
apa
here
that
i
would
drink
again
wish
it
was
distributed
out
here
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
sticky
and
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
as
is
the
finish
this
beer
doesnt
showcase
the
apa
very
well
it
is
just
and
average
typical
beer
serving
type
bottle
body
feels
light
and
watery
the
beer
is
smooth
but
low
drinkability
due
to
taste
this
beer
is
less
than
stellar
it
seems
to
be
a
big
hit
in
atlanta
and
other
places
in
the
southeast
but
have
yet
to
really
figure
out
why
overall
to
date
i
am
very
unimpressed
with
the
brewery
after
trying
5
or
so
of
there
beers
poured
a
cloudy
apricot
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
it
had
a
very
fruity
sweet
apricot
smell
the
taste
was
sweet
fruits
and
malts
up
front
with
a
hint
of
mild
hop
bitterness
had
a
clean
mouthfeel
and
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
in
the
end
expecting
something
a
bit
stronger
hoppier
or
just
different
since
it
had
the
420
tag
on
it
it
has
the
makings
of
something
special
if
only
it
had
more
of
everything
i
guess
that
is
just
the
way
they
have
decided
to
go
naming
the
beer
after
a
weed
reference
and
slacking
off
on
the
final
product
overall
a
good
session
beer
for
the
spring
time
pretty
good
apa
once
youve
had
it
a
bit
it
isnt
fantastic
enough
to
get
exicted
about
but
it
always
makes
for
a
good
choice
poured
a
bit
too
cold
into
pint
glass
producing
a
nice
creamy
head
that
clings
a
bit
to
the
glass
and
stays
for
quite
some
time
nose
is
floral
light
hops
and
grain
taste
is
roughly
the
same
though
more
grain
and
slightest
bitterness
on
the
finish
quenching
and
not
too
high
on
the
abv
to
make
this
a
sessionabledrinkable
beer
hv
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
on
for
an
afternoon
in
the
sun
the
alcohol
smells
are
pretty
strong
during
each
drink
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
delightful
brew
will
buy
again
and
you
should
enjoy
sweetwaters
flagship
beer
glad
its
in
nc
md
light
body
medium
carbonation
rather
smooth
drinkability
is
decent
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
but
you
can
tell
the
building
blocks
are
there
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
but
that
doesnt
means
its
anything
worth
writing
home
about
medium
body
appropriate
carbonation
very
easy
drinker
on
draft
on
420
day
at
the
saucer
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
a
1
finger
head
aroma
consists
of
citrus
floral
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
malt
profile
but
there
are
some
risidual
hop
taste
this
is
a
great
light
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
without
having
to
think
too
hard
d
great
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
doesnt
focus
too
much
on
either
malt
or
hops
well
rounded
and
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
finish
as
many
as
i
can
pours
a
clear
amber
with
2
finger
white
head
ok
retention
spotty

smelling
a
citrus
tree
leafy
with
tangerineorange
faint
grapefruit
and
grassy
noble
hops
taste
lightly
bready
leafy
orange
tangy
lemon
nectarine
nice
sweetness
to
balance
the
leafy
and
citric
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
carbonation
level
is
nice
but
understated
otherwise
its
a
bit
thin
theres
a
nice
sweetness
to
go
with
a
sensible
hoppiness
but
slightly
more
malt
or
carbonation
would
be
nice
tasty
but
not
their
ipa
d
despite
the
flaws
420
is
fairly
drinkable
its
blandness
is
also
a
testament
to
its
inoffensiveness
making
it
easy
to
quaff
theres
nothing
exciting
about
this
brew
and
there
are
better
choices
for
the
style
much
more
impressed
with
sweetwaters
other
offerings
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
nice
crisp
orange
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
pale
malts
but
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
even
for
a
pale
the
beer
is
crisp
and
very
light
almost
watery
i
have
to
guess
that
the
only
reason
this
beer
is
popular
is
the
marijuana
reference
in
the
name
because
there
are
many
better
pale
ales
out
there
m
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
this
particular
one
comes
across
like
it
may
have
been
a
little
old
i
dont
suspect
it
is
but
it
had
flavours
like
those
i
sometimes
find
with
a
slightly
expired
brew
i
rechecked
though
and
it
is
labeled
as
being
best
before

carbonation
is
decent
with
an
assertive
sharpness
and
a
lighter
body
to
make
for
a
refreshing
feel
slightly
dry
adding
a
little
more
character
to
it
id
try
it
again
but
dont
know
what
more
id
expect
fairly
accessible
if
nothing
else
drinkability
ok
apa
ive
had
this
bottle
for
a
few
months
so
maybe
its
my
fault
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
could
would
try
again
pours
a
clear
translucent
amber
in
color
with
only
a
soapy
ring
of
froth
developing
on
the
pour
smell
is
malts
and
some
old
still
holding
on
hops
the
best
by
date
is
still
another
3
months
away
taste
is
old
and
not
good
for
a
supposed
to
still
be
good
beer
very
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
not
something
i
would
revisit
again

pale

a
wonderful
golden
color
with
a
sweet

it
presented
a

a
smooth

i
really
like
this
one
and
drink
it
on
a
regular
occasion
a
very
easy
drinking
well
done

the
balance
is
great

the

leaves
me
wanting

a

i
hope
to
find
it
again
really
tasty
beer
i
would
take
this
over
a
bud
coors
even
a

but
not
much
over
that
this
is
a
really
easy
drinker
very
smooth

with

crispness
to
not

in

mellow

light

bitterness
not
much
there
at

in

i
could
see
this
becoming
a
great

sessioner
whenever
it
arrives
in
bottles
recommend
this
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
and
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
if
i
ever
make
it
south
id
be
interested
to
see
if
this
bottle
is
somewhat
skunked

if
it
was
just
my
imagination

one
of
only
a

extra
pales
ive
had
do
like
the
style
though
md
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
and
lacking
bitterness
from
significant
amounts
of
hops
the
drinkabilility
is
good
in
that
it
is
light
and
thirst
quenching
a
decent
starting
beer
for
the
night
d
clean
crisp

makes
this
a
very
sessionable

this
beer
is
pretty
much
my
standard
beer
if
im
going
someplace
with
limited
selection
luckily
probably
95
of
barsrestaurants
in
atlanta
sell
this
so
i
can
always
get
a
great
brew
i
had
this
several
times
on
recent
trips
to
the
atlanta
area
it
is
a
crispclean
apa
with
balanced
hop
smell
and
flavor
it
is
very
drinkable
and
as
sessionable
a
beer
can
get
it

is
decent
some
citrus
up
front
followed
by
alot
of
earthy
sweetness
a
little
too
grassy
and
dry
late
even
for
the
style
nice
sweetness
and
light
on
the
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
until
the
next
morning
if
you
know
what
i
mean
5head
left
after
about
a
minute
sweeter
than
most
pale
ales
and
fruitier
but
lacks
the
hops
and
the
bite
to
make
it
a
serious
craft
contender
just
a
little
backwards
i
want
my
pales
taste
to
linger
for
a
while
needs
more
hops
and
a
little
more
bite
like
hummer
it
is
a
little
oversweet
and
watered
down
for
its
style
however
but
this
is
to
be
expected
from
an
extra
pale
this
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
as
it
essentially
goes
down
like
water
no
realy
over
bearing

overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
solid
pale
ale
i
liked
the
citric
undertones
and
dryness
of
the
taste
i
drank
quite
a
few
of
these
both
from
the
tap
and
from
the
bottle
and
really
enjoyed
them
this
one
was
really
easy
to
drink
with
some
prominent
flavors
that
werent
to
aggressive
pours
to
an
nice
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
nice
lacing
that
stays
on
long
fruity
hoppy
aroma
of
bananas
and
citrus
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
finish
would
be
good
for
the
golf
course
beach
or
other
activities
calling
for
several
beers
d
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
mind
blowing
about
this
one
overall
a
good
but
unremarkable
apa
worth
a
try
i
had
this
on
vacation
in
georgia
a
few
years
ago
my
parents
just
brought
back
a
six
pack
from
there
last
trip
that
i
couldnt
go
with
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
that
laces
some
smells
nice
like
like
60
minute
i
just
had
citrus
and
grapefruit
with
a
sweet
soft
malt
balance
nice
flavor
the
bitterness
is
just
deep
enough
but
not
overwhelming
the
sweet
malts
drive
it
through
to
the
bloom
of
hops
citrus
and
pith
nice
and
juicy
ipa
good
stuff
here
i
would
drink
it
with
a
mouse
i
would
drink
it
in
house
courtesy
of
bonhoeffer
and
the
brews
n
tunes
bif
poured
into
a
matching
420
weizen
glass
also
courtesy
of
bonhoeffer
color
is
a
nice
golden
honey
with
a
white
head
head
was
about
a
finger
width
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
is
very
pleasant
and
just
a
bit
sweet
i
can
smell
the
aromatic
hops
its
like
honey
with
a
bit
of
lemon
the
taste
was
like
honey
but
not
cloying
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
syrupy
balanced
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
great
beer
period
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
with
little
lacing
and
eventually
leaves
no
film
the
smell
is
a
nice
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
some
well
balanced
biscuity
malts
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
hops
hitting
you
first
and
the
malts
coming
later
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
could
be
a
tad
thicker
overall
highly
drinkable
good
regional
pale
ale
mouth
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
smells
its
not
juice
afterall
actualy
the
beer
is
kind
of
sour
with
citrus
overtones
and
a
strong
bitter
swallow
that
mellows
out
upon
exhaling
and
pleasantly
lasts
for
minutes
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
floral
hops
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
slight
balancing
malt
sweetness
fairly
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
comes
off
as
a
decent
ipa
with
some
caramel
malt
backing
drinkability
was
distinctly
average
not
offensive
just
mundane
this
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
though
i
cant
belive
the
5
4
abv
seems
like
it
should
be
lower
d
very
good
drinkability
thirst
quenching
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
i
think
id
prefer
a
slightly
dryer
more
bitter
pale
ale
but
this
is
nonetheless
a
well
done
beer
and
worth
a
pint
or
two
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
that
has
a
well
sustained
white
head
nose
is
of
malts
and
floral
hops
taste
is
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
creamy
full
and
well
carbonated
for
the
style
overall
drinkabilty
is
good
this
is
a
well
crafted
pale
that
is
worth
a
try
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
mason
jar
the
beer
had
a
small
head
and
was
typically
colored
for
a
pale
ale
there
was
a
slightly
higher
hop
smell
than
usual
the
taste
was
fairly
bitter
there
was
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
left
in
the
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
an
average
beer
da
fine
epa
but
not
as
bold
as
some
others
which
is
hitting
me
very
well
right
now
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
three
that
came
in
the
pack
a
great
session
brew
note
yes
a
little
bit
of
sentimentalness
in
the
review
but
who
cares
its
my
opinion
right
ugh
aroma
carries
floral
orange
blossom
laden
hops
that
are
only
slightly
piney
almost
nutty
caramel
malt
aromas
as
well
color
is
an
orangeyellow
an
the
large
head
diminshes
slowly
fore
is
fruity
and
fat
with
breadysweet
malts
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
but
mostly
smooth
malts
very
tasty
brew
poured
a
yelloworange
color
with
modest
white
head
smekll
is
strong
on
hops
with
strong
notes
of
pine
grasses
and
citrus
taste
has
much
less
of
a
malt
presence
with
the
hops
being
very
restrained
and
malt
being
more
in
the
foreground
even
though
the
hops
were
not
very
strong
the
taste
was
very
pleasing
finish
is
more
malty
sweetness
with
a
light
underlying
hop
dryness
a
very
pleasant
drinking
beer
that
was
different
from
other
beers
in
this
glass
pretty
good
pale
ale
from
sweetwater
i
have
had
two
of
their
brews
and
have
liked
them
both
kudos
to
the
beer
of
the
month
club
tried
from
a
bottle
at
chops
in
atlanta
the
beer
was
served
in
a
large
wine
glass
which
really
changed
the
aroma
and
appearance
from
my
last
review
the
smell
was
of
a
really
citrusy
floral
hops
the
appearance
was
a
great
brownish
orange
color
with
a
white
larger
bubbled
head
that
laced
for
about
the
first
half
of
the
beer
the
taste
was
also
improved
becaus
of
the
improved
aroma
highly
recomend
trying
in
this
manner
also
was
great
with
the
prime
rib
and
horseradish
sauce
that
i
ordered
overall
this
is
a
winner
the
hoppiness
gives
you
the
apa
flavor
you
crave
but
the
balance
will
keep
it
going
strong
for
as
many
as
you
care
to
consume
for
those
who
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
give
this
one
a
shot
they
are
similar
yet
unique
beers
and
they
both
have
alot
going
for
them
perfect
with
pizza
and
friends
overall
not
a
mindboggling
pale
ale
but
a
very
good
local
brew
that
one
should
try
when
in
georgia
an
ok
brew
for
the
closet
hophead
not
that
bad
a
beer
but
it
is
on
the
verge
of
harsh
on
the
bitterness
level
for
the
style
if
i
was
the
brewer
i
would
cut
the
boil
time
in
half
and
dry
hop
this
more
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
really
a
bit
thin
for
a
good
pale
ale
but
works
for
what
i
generally
pick
this
beer
up
for
as
noted
in
the
appearance
lots
of
carbonation
it
finishes
fairly
clean
but
has
some
lingering
bitterness
overall
a
really
drinkable
beer
not
so
much
due
to
the
flavor
but
because
of
how
light
it
is
while
still
being
a
decent
beer
a
nice
drinkable
apa
easily
sessionable
this
is
definitely
an
example
of
a
beer
that
tastes
better
than
it
looks
i
know
ive
had
the
420
in
my
past
at
one
point
but
apparently
never
reviewed
it
pours
a
nice
head
but
i
see
really
no
carbonation
light
golden
color
not
really
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
but
well
balanced
nonetheless
easy
to
drink
a
nice
starter
for
this
style
for
those
not
as
familiar
could
be
a
session
beer
especially
in
the
summer
this
beer
is
a
slight
copperish
color
with
tints
of
light
orange
it
has
good
carbonation
and
is
pretty
clear
the
smell
is
light
malt
nice
fruity
hops
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
touch
metallic
which
quickly
fades
to
a
nice
bitterness
there
is
no
lack
of
body
and
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
there
is
no
trace
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
yet
its
listed
at
5
4
very
good
overall
apa
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
only
pale
ale
i
really
find
myself
yearning
for
i
only
wish
someone
in
huntsville
would
carry
it
this
would
be
a
fantastic
brew
to
drink
down
after
a
hard
days
work
looks
like
alabamas
got
something
going
for
it
in
this
brew
d
very
nice

beer

it
the

this
pale

is
definitely
sweet
the
head
is
thin
but
leaves
an
impressive
lacing
on

the
nose

malty
taste
is
quite

altough
there
is
definitely
a
hop
character
mouthfeel
is
a
little

drinkability
is
good
with
a
fairly
low
alcohol
this
one
is
pretty
good
for
a
pale

all
in
all
the
guys
that
make
it
are
awesome
and
while
there
are

bolder

extra
pale
ale
is
an
okay
version
that
fails
to
impress
in
any
one
area
but
still
manages
to
be
drinkable
a
heavier
hand
with
the
ingredients
would
have
resulted
in
a
better
beer

i
lived
in

id
probably
stick

with
some
tawny
influences
the
color
is
lighter
than
most
apas
but
that
is
not
an
issue
the
liquid
is
largely
clear
with
speckles
of
suspended
yeast
sediment
white

about
two
fingers
in
height
at
its

head
retention
was
good
it
faded
quickly
to
a
half
finger
cap
i
was
impressed
that
a
cap
of
this
size
had
such
good
staying
power
a
small
cap
lasted
the
entire
consumption
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
clung
poorly
overall
the
appearance
is
good
the
nose
is
softly
malty
with
hints
of
spicy
hops
bready
throughout
with
a
good
yeasty
aura
it
has
that
fresh
baked
scent
the
potency
is
low
though
clean
the
nose
is
interesting
in
the
sense
that
this
pale
ale
fails
to
be
hoppy
hell
it
fails
to
say
much
of
anything
the
bouquet
is
not
inviting
because
there
is
nothing
there
what
a
bummer
the
palate
is
much
improved
over
the
nose
i
can
taste
the
hops
yeah
now
dont
fool
yourself
the
hoppy
influences
are
minimal
but
they
are
at
least
perceptible
hops
do
offer
some
grassyspice
some
citrus
and
some
wood
malt
is
soft
and
kind
of
bready
dry
at
times
like
a
cracker
orange
zest
flowers
and
some
distant
peaches
can
be
found
at
the
back
modestly
yeasty
the
palate
is
very
average
but
friendly
it
reminds
me
of
boulevard
pale
ale
420
is
not
as
bitter
or
as
citrusy
the
aftertaste
is
malty
and
dry
with
just
a
flash
of
hops
the
palate
is
good
medium
in
body
low
but
natural
carbonation
helps
produce
a
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
that
works
well
with
this
beer
nice
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
plenty
drinkable
but
it
is
nothing
special
i
am
sure
if
this
beer
were
a
local
id
quaff
this
pale
ale
with
burgers
or
on
a
poker
night
its
a
solid
beer
but
forgettable
thanks
to

slightly
sweet
malts

citrus
hops
flavor
is
all
citrus
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
subdues
hop
bite
mediumlight
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
thoroughly
average
pale
ale
nothing
distinct
or
extra
about
it
quite
the

pours
a
golden
color
very
light

hints
with
a
white
head
that
fall

that
lasts
aroma
is
overly
sweet
with
floral
earthy
hops
dominating
with
some
orangey
citrus
in
the
background
taste
is
like
aroma
sweet
malt
almost
syrupy
like
then
floral
hops
take
over
leaving
light
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
tounge
nice
clean

taste
nice
mouthfeel
just
to
sweet
drinkability
in
the
bottle
form
just
plain
average
i
have
had
this
on
tap
several
times
any
always
enjoyed
it
do
not
understand
why
the
bottle
version
seems
so
different
meant
to
actually
review
this
on
draft
today
but
the
mellow
mushroom
in
blowing
rock
was
out
and
i
had
to
have
cottonwoods
pumpkin
on
draft
instead
but
thats
a
good
thing
thought
i
would
by
a
sixer
and
review
them
i
dont
really
see
why
it
is
so
diffrent
heck
on
draft
it
is
even
more
amber
in
color
then
golden
if
you
can
have
it
on
draft
try
it
if
not
i
would
pass
acquired
via
trade
this
beer
is
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
thin
and
quick
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
decent
amount
of
hops
along
with
some
malt
and
spice
mediumbodied
and
crisp
with
a
moderate
hops
presence
along
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
this
is
a
straightforward
apa
that
i
would
try
again
i
have
seen
a
staggering
amount
of
this
stuff
sell
and
was
curious
as
to
why
in
bloody
hell
this
stuff
is
so
popular
well
why
it
is
so
popular
is
an
absolute
mystery
to
me
i
tried
it
tonight
and
thought
it
was
very
close
to
being
total
crap
it
poured
an
orange
copper
colour
with
a
white
fluffy
head
decent
head
retention
with
sticky
lacing
the
smell
was
extremely
hoppy
floral
hoppy
like
a
nice
cool
pint
of
aftershave
the
taste
only
amplified
this
is
this
taste
and
aroma
what
people
really
want
apparently
so
because
a
lot
of
places
have
a
hard
time
keeping
it
on
the
shelves
perhaps
this
just
isnt
for
me

as

the
taste
is
fairly

with

the
sweet
taste
holds
throughout
the
tasting
as
there
is
amazingly
little
to
no
bitterness
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a

the

bells

pale
ale
is
an
okay
pale
ale
i
prefer
others
unfiltered
and
unfettered
by
gimmicks
o
kinda
like
a
pale
ale
done
like
a
rustic
homespun
saison
reminds
me
of
hof
ten
dormaals
blond
that
i
had
recently
just
with
slightly
different
yeast
character
and
more
biting
hop
bitterness
nothing
incredibly
special
about
this
brew
it
has
some
bitterness
to
it
that
gives
it
some
depth
but
for
the
most
part
it
comes
across
somewhat
hollow
and
leaves
me
a
little
underwhelmed
especially
in
comparison
to
the
vast
array
of
bells
other
delicious
beers
review
is
actually
for
larrys
latest
pale
ale
which
is
not
on
ba
yet
overall
a
bland
pale
that
i
wouldnt
recommend
i
had
it
free
so
i
cant
complain
but
i
wouldnt
return
to
this
ok
beer
but
nothing
really
good
i
could
say
about
it
new
packaging
since
my
original
experence
with
the
beer
hazy
golden
color
and
a
grainy
aroma
a
bit
of
malt
character
that
finishes
with
a
bitter
bite
grainy
malt
and
some
sweetness
not
one
of
the
better
bells
offerings
and
maybe
priced
higher
because
of
the
bells
name
worth
a
try
goes
down
easy
o
this
is
a
very
sessionable
apa
that
i
would
be
happy
to
put
down
all
evening
long
enjoyable
but
not
overly
complex
and
the
hops
are
not
as
big
as
in
some
other
offerings
in
the
style
easy
to
drink
with
the
less
intense
flavorsaromas
and
well
hidden
alcohol
a
rather
unexciting
take
from
bells
pale
and
pushes
toward
a
typical
apa
but
ultimately
falls
a
little
short
its
still
decent
to
drink
but
there
are
better
options
for
the
same
price
o
i
have
to
say
im
quite
disappointed
i
expected
much
more
from
bells
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
nothing
impressive
about
it
bland
smell
bland
taste
and
too
much
carbonation
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
o
its
pretty
decent
id
opt
for
this
over
almost
all
mainstream
beers
but
from
what
ive
experienced
from
bells
i
expected
much
more
but
not
terrible
not
at
all
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
creamy
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
is
quite
bad
skunky
smelling
taste
is
much
better
a
light
cracker
malt
followed
by
some
pine
and
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
much
better
without
the
bad
aroma
mouth
feel
medium
bodied
feel
carbonation
kills
the
likability
o
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
i
like
how
there
were
so
many
particles
and
the
head
was
excellent
the
taste
was
a
little
dull
though
this
beers
not
all
that
complex
but
its
a
decent
session
brew
overall
this
is
just
too
generically
bitter
without
any
of
the
good
hop
flavors
that
make
pale
ales
enjoyable
fine
to
have
on
draft
with
lunch
for
5
but
nothing
i
would
want
in
a
6
pack
amount
while
i
would
like
to
pretend
to
myself
that
i
dont
frequently
whine
about
styles
this
has
some
style
issues
this
smells
and
tastes
like
an
american
blonde
ale
and
its
not
great
even
for
that
style
it
isnt
bad
though
but
typically
when
i
drink
a
beer
from
bells
i
start
to
feel
sad
that
i
cant
get
it
on
the
east
coast
i
wont
be
sad
to
not
drink
this
again
anytime
soon
overall
a
solid
clean
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
one
at
a
session
is
good
for
me
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pale
this
is
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
someone
were
to
tell
me
this
were
bells
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
based
on
some
of
their
others
beers
ive
had
regardless
of
that
its
still
a
solid
beer
id
very
gladly
have
again
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
i
cant
say
i
disliked
it
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
either
id
recommend
this
to
people
that
find
most
pale
ales
lacking
a
certain
kick

reminds

more
of

than

its
a
drinkable
beer
drinkable
light
fruit
i
bought
this
bottle
from
a
sale
rack
at
a
local
whole
foods
store
and
it
was
probably
not
as
fresh
as
it
could
have
been
to
be
fair
overallnotes
kind
of
disappointed
to
be
honest
bells
twohearted
is
so
fantastic
that
i
had
way
too
lofty
of
expectations
that
being
said
this
beer
just
feels
too
light
for
an
apa
its
got
all
of
the
basic
elements
but
none
of
the
daring
that
it
takes
to
make
a
really
good
beer
ill
give
it
a
second
try
in
the
near
future
just
to
confirm
db
i
would
say
the
bitterness
takes
away
from
the
flavor
and
feel
of
this
one
if
it
was
a
bit
less
bitter
i
would
enjoy
it
more
overall
some
nice
flavors
but
nothing
makes
this
one
stand
out
d
this
is
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
i
have
certainly
had
better
i
definitely
go
with
a
different
bells
product
next
time
i
purchase
something
from
them
dnothing
great
but
still
a
decent
entry
level
brew
from

was
thinking
it
was
going
to
have
a
little

impact
far
as
the
floral
and
flavor
goes
overall
i
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
buttery
notes
were
a
bit
over
the
top
for
me
especially
as
the
beer
warmed
this
really
isnt
very
good
not
at
all
interesting

by
the
end
its

easy
drinking
overall
the
beers
afterbite
is
its
strongest
or
most
pronounced
feature
although
its
looks
are
good
too
light
body
makes
it
easy
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
really
a
decent
brew
perfect
spring
and
summer
brew
ill
give
this
another
go
before
summer
ends
for
sure
drinkability
the
brew
is
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
by
any
means
there
are
so
many
better
apas
out
there
that
are
much
more
enjoyable
thank
goodness
for
mixed
bottle
6packs
drinkability
is
good
however
there
are
fall
too
many
beers
i
would
drink
over
this
at
the
price
dissapointing
offering
from
bells
d
absolutely
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
craft
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
beer
pours
a
radiant
orangeyellow
cloudy
due
to
a
ton
of
suspended
yeasties
not
that
thats
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
white
head
initially
swells
up
to
about
a
fingers
worth
but
retention
and
lacing
are
both
a
little
weak
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
american
hops
but
not
as
pungent
as
i
would
expect
from
an
american
pale
ale
theres
also
a
prominent
pale
malt
sweetness
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
carbon
copy
of
the
nose
orange
and
lemon
zest
at
the
close
along
with
an
upfront
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
a
brief
crack
of
hop
bitterness
falls
in
between
the
two
and
is
a
welcome
addition
body
is
appropriately
light
almost
surprisingly
so
for
the
amount
of
malty
flavor
this
beer
has
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
does
a
good
job
of
emphasizing
the
hops
while
not
becoming
too
fizzy
the
solid
taste
restrained
hop
presence
and
great
mouthfeel
make
this
an
extremely
easy
drinking
beer
a
great
effort
from
bells
hazy
yellow
pour
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
quickly
fading
head
and
minimal
lacing
lots
of
grass
in
the
nose
and
not
much
else
it
has
an
odd
almost
sourness
in
the
taste
and
again
lots
of
grassiness
with
very
little
else
going
on
you
begin
to
taste
a
little
sweet
maltiness
and
just
a
touch
of
citrus
but
nothing
great
it
has
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
and
good
carbonation
this
was
very
surprising
and
disappointing
to
have
a
beer
this
bad
come
from
a
brewery
thats
typically
top
notch
drinkability
its
pretty
hoppy
but
overall
just
an
ok
pale
ale
biggest
letdown
from
bells
which
is
otherwise
a
fantastic
brewery
2nd
try
now
this
is
more
like
it
this
one
was
only
bottled
a
couple
months
ago
so
a
lot
fresher
than
the
one
i
had
before
the
appearance
is
about
the
same
the
nose
has
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
it
along
with
some
sweet
scents
possibly
honey
or
floral
notes
very
subtle
but
nice
the
taste
is
like
ten
times
better
than
the
last
one
i
had
no
sournesstartness
this
time
around
and
the
hops
are
definitely
in
the
house
this
time
i
get
lovely
hops
that
are
not
too
bitter
with
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweetness
this
is
a
very
pleasant
pale
ale
i
also
get
a
bit
or
orange
and
honey
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
still
light
but
much
more
body
to
it
than
the
old
one
drinkability
is
extremely
high
on
this
beer
drinkability
would
not
drink
this
again
try
it
once
and
be
done
with
it
bottom
line
if
you
are
looking
for
some
sort
of
miniature
version
of
two
hearted
then
look
elsewhere
bells
pale
ale
is
shockingly
bad
d
sessioner
for
sure
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
bells
it
poured
amber
with
a
small
head
it
had
many
suspended
particles
in
the
beer
it
tasted
bitter
with
a
strong
note
of
hops
smelled
flat
like
beer
just
no
real
noticeable
smell
the
taste
was
much
the
same
with
not
a
ton
of
flavor
overall
it
was
not
bad
just
something
i
dont
need
to
rush
and
get
right
away
d
maybe
its
because
i
expect
more
from
a
bells
beer
but
im
pretty
disappointed
with
this
one
the
flavor
isnt
quite
satisfying
and
the
carbonation
level
is
too
high
d
very
drinkable
and
pretty
light
i
may
have
expected
more
in
an
apa
overall
it
was
an
ok
beer
i
prefer
a
more
noticeable
hop
presence
in
an
apa
and
compared
to
say
sierras
pale
ale
this
one
doesnt
compare
favorably
like
i
said
though
im
sure
it
has
its
place
and
could
be
enjoyed
by
a
lot
of
people
that
prefer
this
style
of
beer
a
good
beer
i
little
rough
around
the
edges
though
nothing
all
that
special
but
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
the
six
pack
worth
a
try
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
tons
of
suspended
particles
in
it
not
the
best
start
for
the
pour
with
it
looking
like
a
snow
globe
and
all
head
is
nice
and
white
smell
is
sugary
and
grapefruity
first
taste
is
all
grapefruit
and
sour
and
melony
pretty
nasty
in
fact
finish
is
quick
dry
and
bitter
after
sampling
two
hearted
ale
this
beer
was
a
supreme
disappointment
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
notes
good
mouthfeel
i
like
this
beer
and
suspect
ill
rate
it
higher
than
the
average
d
quite
drinkable
can
definitely
do
a
few
of
these
summerybbq
beers
d
an
overall
decent
beer
but
not
something
ill
rush
out
to
get
more
of
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
yeasty
white
head
aroma
had
a
malty
buttery
smell
to
it
taste
was
initially
like
malts
and
biscuits
but
the
hops
quickly
killed
that
flavor
only
thing
left
was
a
watery
hoppy
taste
decent
body
in
terms
of
thickness
and
carbonation
although
a
bit
thin
in
my
opinion
drinkable
but
a
lot
of
other
better
beer
out
there
quite
disappointing
considering
bells
puts
out
a
lot
of
good
beers
dits
pretty
drinkable
but
pretty
forgettable
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
looking
to
convert
macro
drinking
buddies
i
was
pretty
dissapointed
drinking
this
after
the
two
hearted
really
should
have
done
this
one
first
bells
pale
ale
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
smaller
head
it
smelt
a
bit
lighter
but
kinda
of
hoppy
as
well
it
had
a
lighter
blonde
ale
taste
that
was
a
bit
hoppy
it
wasnt
too
difficult
to
drink
i
am
just
unsure
if
i
would
want
another
one
because
the
taste
wasnt
any
speical
overall
it
proably
should
not
have
been
labeled
a
pale
ale
pretty
drinkable
but
there
are
a
number
of
better
pale
ales
out
there
bells
usually
makes
some
pretty
good
beer
but
this
is
clearly
one
of
their
weakest
of
their
offerings
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
crossover
beer
for
people
who
usually
drink
budmillerpbr
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
citrusy
smelling
the
beer
poured
a
nice
frothy
head
the
brew
was
a
little
hoppy
smelling
and
a
little
hoppy
tasting
this
beer
to
me
also
was
a
little
too
bitter
i
like
bells
beers
but
i
guess
i
will
not
revisit
this
again
highly
sessionable
apa
d
not
bad
pretty
good
rather
bold
example
of
the
style
d
sessionable
nice
flavor
for
this
abv
d
easy
drinking
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
well
integrated
carbonation
can
be
a
bit
filling
abv
is
manageable
d
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
flavor
to
speak
of
but
it
does
drink
rather
easily
theres
no
way
this
is
an
apa
though
its
a
blonde
ale
overall
not
one
of
my
go
to
pale
ales
has
some
english
tasting
influences
hops
dont
quite
come
through
as
one
would
expect
from
bells
a
good
example
of
what
an
ipa
is
capable
of
without
becoming
an
extreme
version
of
the
genre
easy
drinking
and
fairly
enjoyable
would
have
again
i
have
been
sampling
numerous
bells
brews
lately
and
it
seems
that
they
play
it
safe
on
alot
of
their
beers
i
guess
i
would
rather
have
them
err
on
the
side
of
caution
then
brew
something
over
the
top
conversation
piece
beer
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
bells
beers
i
have
had
thus
far
for
the
price
there
are
other
beers
i
would
rather
drink
although
i
did
get
this
6pack
on
sale
for
7
99
overall
impression
cant
recommend
this
one
oldbad
bottle
no
dating
on
the
bottle
d
nothing
i
will
ever
seek
out
again
there
are
far
better
apas
out
there

i
just
finished
the
sixer
last
night
and
i
must
say
this
beer
was
better
today
i
must
have
had
a
bad
day
when
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
i
rerated
accordingly
from
a
review
below
i
dont
think
i
ever
saw
yeast
sediment
floating
in
a
glass
like
this
before
it
looks
like
a
snow
globe
d
one
was
enough
for
me
would
not
buy
again
there
are
far
superior
selections
of
this
style
d
very
drinkable
near
perfection
in
drinkability
to
be
exact
this
is
a
wellrounded
delicious
beer
which
would
work
well
for
any
occasion
i
believe
a
sixpack
may
be
in
order
very
drinkable
and
quite
nice
the
drying
effect
makes
it
hard
to
resist
another
sip
i
have
never
had
an
unfiltered
pale
ale
like
this
before
and
the
yeast
added
a
nice
touch
to
all
aspects
of
the
brew
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
slightly
unique
yet
still
a
classic
example
of
the
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
left
about
12
of
white
head
left
some
lacing
appearance
is
light
yellow
with
lots
of
sedimentation
the
sediment
floats
in
the
glass
for
the
whole
time
kinda
like
its
a
homebrew
smell
is
faint
floral
and
mildly
hoppy
taste
is
the
same
theres
a
good
mild
hop
taste
a
very
good
example
of
the
pale
ale
taste
carbonation
is
right
for
the
style
drinkability
is
right
up
there
bells
pale
ale
from
bells
brewery
pours
a
light
amber
blonde
in
my
pint
glass
smells
like
a
typical
apa
not
much
foam
or
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
is
really
the
best
thing
going
on
here
hops
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
citrus
make
for
a
refreshing
beer
i
especially
like
the
yeastyness
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
always
make
sure
to
do
the
swril
in
order
to
get
all
the
flavor
from
my
bottle
a
very
sessionable
beer
drinkability
the
soapy
aftertaste
is
very
off
putting
but
even
with
that
it
is
quite
refreshing
will
need
to
revisit
d
the
light
body
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
lack
of
any
flavor
will
keep
me
from
purchasing
this
one
again
while
this
beer
is
not
necessarily
offensive
it
sure
isnt
anything
special
either
for
the
price
i
think
i
would
have
rather
had
12
grain
belts
uh
this
is
a
bells
beer
i
wouldve
guessed
magic
hat
in
a
blindfolded
taste
taste
and
this
is
probably
on
the
same
level
as
mhs
own
9drinkable
nothing
terribly
wrong
but
leaning
a
little
too
much
toward
hohum
probably
my
leastfavorite
beer
from
the
usually
awesome
bells
next
pours
a
hefe
like
orange
color
with
a
two
finger
head
has
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
to
it
more
of
an
oily
hop
smell
than
anything
else
taste
is
solid
a
textbook
ale
a
dryness
to
it
aswell
as
a
smooth
easy
drinking
body
it
could
use
a
little
more
malt
to
it
to
balance
the
hops
but
thats
just
my
opinion
overall
a
good
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
also
pretty
one
note
with
the
taste
if
there
was
a
bit
more
bitterness
going
on
i
think
i
might
be
into
it
sloshing
the
beer
around
and
first
drink
it
becomes
immediately
apparent
that
the
beauty
of
the
beer
itself
does
not
make
up
enough
for
the
undistinguished
flavor
most
points
on
this
one
come
from
look
and
perceived
texture
however
there
is
a
nice
bite
and
its
definitely
drinkable
just
not
for
the
price
ill
keep
searching
d
on
the
whole
a
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
pale
ale
ever
but
worth
a
go
d
refreshing
d
i
get
the
feeling
people
are
reviewing
this
as
an
ipa
which
is
sad
this
is
a
great
beer
in
a
broad
category
i
would
definitely
have
another
mfd
crisp
carbonation
with
a
light
medium
body
carbonation
makes
the
brew
quite
chewy
and
mouthcoating
and
is
perhaps
the
one
redeemable
feature
to
the
beer
the
drinkablilty
is
low
beacuse
the
beer
is
a
poor
representative
of
its
style
and
moreover
not
very
good
d
drinkable
sure
memorable
no
worth
a
try
i
suppose
but
bells
has
many
other
offerings
that
are
much
more
appealing
guess
drinkability
would
be
ok
several
of
these
would
be
no
problem
but
why
would
you
want
to
drinkability
very
nice
apa
overall
that
is
a
little
unique
due
to
the
color
and
spiciness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
as
i
do
not
seem
to
be
a
big
fan
of
lower
abv
beers
6
or
less
from
bells
a
light
grassy
hay
taste
followed
by
a
slight
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
before
settling
on
the
weak
and
only
somewhat
sweet
and
present
malt
character
maybe
trying
to
leave
some
sediment
behind
this
time
damaged
the
flavor
because
i
feel
like
this
apa
has
been
better
in
the
past
when
i
disregarded
whether
or
not
the
sediment
was
floating
around
this
has
a
bit
of
a
macro
taste
but
like
the
bmc
has
been
mixed
with
a
dales
or
sn
apa
either
way
not
terrible
but
not
as
amazing
as
i
remember
worth
a
try
i
suppose
but
the
worst
offering
from
bells
ive
had
yet
which
doesnt
say
too
much
cheers
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
although
i
have
to
admit
the
floaters
kind
of
turned
me
off
to
this
brew
tastes
like
your
average
pale
ale
feel
like
your
average
pale
ale
and
drinks
like
you
guessed
it
an
average
pale
ale
dont
get
me
wrong
it
isnt
bad
but
it
definitely
gets
lost
among
the
rest
of
the
world
and
would
not
raise
my
interest
the
reviews
were
offputting
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
thoroughly
much
more
so
than
the
amber
ale
pours
a
murky
peach
body
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aromas
are
sweet
maltiness
with
little
hop
character
slightly
lemon
and
funky
in
the
nose
the
flavors
are
sweet
malt
with
a
lemon
grassy
hop
finish
that
is
not
bitter
or
really
sweet
the
hops
arent
quite
up
to
par
for
the
style
light
to
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
decent
drinkability
but
not
a
ton
or
character
d
this
is
an
odd
beer
for
the
style
normally
i
could
care
less
as
long
as
its
good
but
this
beer
seems
to
have
actual
brewing
flaws
i
am
positive
the
boys
at
bells
know
what
theyre
doing
but
the
grainy
astringency
kind
of
overshadows
the
whole
beer
and
it
tastes
oversparged
i
dont
know
you
be
the
judge
mf
is
medium
and
is
kind
of
laborious
to
drink
but
can
be
enjoyed
very
much
sip
by
sip
drink
is
as
well
in
the
middle
it
leaves
a
wet
finish
but
is
still
enjoyable
with
a
meal
not
eant
to
be
drank
by
the
6
pack
so
take
it
easy
on
this
one
and
itll
treat
you
right
sweet
bready
malt
on
the
palate
with
moderate
floral
hop
notes
sweet
sugary
caramel
throughout
alongside
a
light
spice
quality
and
a
berry
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
fine
overall
but
probably
my
least
favorite
bells
to
date
well
balanced
and
fairly
drinkable
the
yeasty
bread
like
taste
is
not
my
favorite
though
it
was
definitely
not
what
i
would
expect
from
an
apa
hops
are
barely
noticeable
cheers
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
i
expected
quite
a
bit
more
ive
enjoyed
everything
ive
had
from
bells
but
this
might
be
the
exception
overall
nothing
to
blow
your
socks
off
but
would
make
an
o
k
session
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
blond
color
with
a
little
head
aroma
of
citrus
and
some
light
honey
very
crisp
to
the
taste
with
more
citrus
and
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
decent
hop
bite
to
it
finishes
clean
and
slightly
dry
very
good
session
beer
and
i
wish
bells
would
start
distributing
in
tx
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
a
very
fresh
tasting
beer
a
good
session
brew
this
beer
cant
hold
a
candle
to
its
big
brothers
but
then
again
those
are
huge
shoes
to
fill
the
beer
was
again
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
still
it
had
good
carbonation
to
it
smooth
clean
and
good
drinkability
overall
a
different
type
of
pale
ale
that
was
pretty
well
done
overall
i
would
reccommend
this
as
a
good
session
pale
ale
clearish
yellow
color
and
thin
head
smell
is
reminiscent
of
bud
light
with
a
touch
more
complexity
citrus
malts
with
sharp
tang
on
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
not
particularly
drinkable
and
the
finish
isnt
smooth
or
refreshing
but
the
citrus
and
fruity
flavors
carry
through
to
the
end

if

mood

a
grainy
witbier
this
is
it
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
apa
look
somewhere
else
aroma
is
malty
weak
not
very
impressive
it
pours
a
typical
clear
golden
amber
with
a
few
little
goobers
in
it
those
dont
bother
me
though
flavor
fortunately
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
mainly
malty
with
a
metallic
tone
not
great
but
potable
texture
is
fizzy
and
fairly
smooth
drinkability
a
decent
drinkable
pale
ale
that
provides
something
a
bit
different
both
in
terms
of
malts
and
hops
used
than
many
americanmade
apas
to
say
nothing
of
the
sea
monkeys
though
enough
talk
of
the
pale
ale
pass
the
kalamazoo
stout
already
overall
a
very
tasty
simple
and
quaffable
pale
ale
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
head
that
quickly
left
with
little
lacing
faint
hop
and
malt
smells
it
tastes
like
an
an
without
bitter
hops
this
is
kind
of
a
let
down
considering
some
other
fine
brews
they
offer
i
guess
i
could
pound
this
like
a
macro
since
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
not
one
of
bells
better
offerings
it
seems
very
drinkable
but
that
might
be
because
i
have
been
craving
a
pale
ale
all
day
overall
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
i
think
i
will
have
another
notes
this
is
superior
to
snpa
d
extremely
drinkable
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
pretty
standard
example
bells
has
tons
of
better
brews
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
is
a
bit
mislabeled
still
very
drinkable
decent
pale
ale
a
bit
dry
easy
drinker
im
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
i
could
kick
back
with
a
six
pack
and
a
brewers
game
while
enjoy
a
nice
evening
on
the
porch
no
doubt
its
a
beautiful
beer
that
i
find
eminently
drinkable
from
bottle
or
from
the
glass
id
recommend
the
glass
because
of
how
nice
every
aspect
of
this
beer
looks
if
you
can
get
over
the
lack
of
good
aroma
and
the
slight
metallic
tinge
it
has
this
would
be
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
for
you
im
generally
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
be
it
an
apa
or
a
blonde
not
enough
flavor
or
hops
to
make
it
memorable
at
all
d
quite
sessionable
while
not
the
best
apa
out
there
certainly
a
decent
offering
when
looking
to
kill
some
time
on
the
beach
and
want
a
little
more
hops
than
oberon
has
to
offer
pours
a
pale
amber
gold
with
a
frothy
slightly
effervescent
pearl
head
thin
lacing
remains
and
a
misty
overall
appearance
the
aroma
is
grainygrassy
with
mild
spicy
hop
notes
some
citrus
resin
as
well
citrus
and
a
spicy
herbal
flavor
basically
characterizes
this
one
some
husky
grain
and
mild
yeast
notes
bright
with
some
metallic
character
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
a
nice
goto
when
little
else
is
available
but
a
middleoftheroad
pale
ale
at
best
enjoyable
but
not
remarkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
the
carbonations
is
also
very
light
and
smooth
drinkability
this
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
and
refreshing
but
not
remarkable
eminently
drinkable
and
utterly
forgettable
no
real
off
or
bad
flavors
but
lacking
in
character
aroma
is
a
bit
odd
musty
funk
of
orange
citrus
and
malt
which
leads
right
into
the
quaff
rather
earthy
pale
ale
dry
and
woody
finish
not
the
best
pale
ive
ever
had
and
really
not
worth
the
almost
10
a
sixer
price
bells
makes
overall
good
beers
but
they
seem
to
be
overpriced
to
me
drinkable
enough
but
lacking
any
outstanding
character
for
a
classic
apa
and
not
tasting
too
fresh
either
mouthfeel
id
lay
off
the
carbonation
with
this
beer
felt
it
was
overcarbonated
for
this
style
id
love
to
try
this
on
cast
sometime
good
mouthfeel
a
bit
bubbly
good
drinkability
because
it
is
so
mild
d
its
not
bad
taste
is
rather
weak
not
much
to
speak
of
very
thin
on
the
feel
slight
hop
presence
not
much
malt
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
lighter
bodied
not
big
on
carbonation
its
drinkable
but
not
what
i
am
after
in
an
apa
this
is
a
blonde
pale
ale
and
pours
as
such
with
a1
inch
head
and
grat
lacing
its
very
nice
the
smell
is
different
it
is
a
spicy
herbhop
smell
with
citrus
undertones
and
sweet
malt
finish
very
good
the
taste
is
the
same
its
a
spicy
bitter
but
great
great
flavor
different
from
most
pale
ales
the
mouth
feel
is
hops
spicy
bitter
malt
floral
just
delicious
its
very
good
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
bells
just
makes
great
ales
period
an
a
for
this
one
i
recommend
it
solid
american
pale
ale
designed
for
easy
sessioning
relatively
low
alcohol
along
with
nice
balance
make
this
an
anytimeofday
quaff
but
i
usually
prefer
bigger
hops
nice
pours
a
golden
straw
light
for
a
pale
ale
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
odd
pale
ale
scent
a
bit
of
hoppiness
but
also
strong
aromas
that
are
usually
associated
with
lagers
and
with
wheat
ales
the
taste
has
some
nice
floral
hints
but
theres
a
strong
witbier
spiciness
to
it
as
well
with
a
peppery
aftertaste
goes
down
fine
although
not
particularly
smooth
this
just
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
mishmash
beer
mid
body
beer
good
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
i
am
excited
to
see

good
unfiltered

drinkability
a
very
nice
pale

one
of
the
better
examples
of
the

a
very
good
daytoday
beer
if
you
can
get
it
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
placebut
a
very
enjoyable
session
type
ale
or
lawnmower
beer
bells
pale
ale
wont
knock
the
socks
off
but
its
solid
smooth
tasty
beer
it
went
great
with
the
grilled
mozzarella
and
turkey
sandwich
with
a
kosher
dill
on
the
side
quite
good
pours
a
murky
light
gold
in
color
whatever
head
formed
on
the
pour
is
quickly
gone
and
leaves
some
nice
webby
lacing
some
very
very
faint
hops
in
the
nose
not
too
much
to
get
excited
about
there
very
crisp
with
more
hop
flavor
coming
through
in
the
taste
thats
more
like
it
clean
and
well
crafted
d
not
too
bad
i
could
drink
a
few
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
foamy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
without
any
lacing
bland
aroma
consisting
of
subtle
citrus
hops
and
slight
maltiness
malty
with
floral
hop
flavor
and
bitter
sweet
citrus
hop
aftertaste
slightly
dry
finish
ddecent
drinkability
its
quite
different
than
most
of
the
typical
apas
however
it
certainly
has
its
merits
within
its
differences
this
brew
is
quite
a
bit
more
refreshing
than
many
other
apas
taste
floral
flavor
with
a
citrus
peel
hop
taste
bitter
aftertaste
definitely
a
great
pale
ale
dthis
would
be
a
good
session
beer
maybe
a
little
light
on
the
hop
flavor
for
the
style
but
would
make
a
great
intro
to
the
apapale
ale
style
pours
a
very
cloudy
fizzy
yellowslight
orangish
color
big
white

medium

bubbles
lasting
creamy
somewhat

aroma
medium

malty
balanced

fizzy
somewhat
hoppy
aftertaste
tastes
a
little
more
ipaish
than
pale

pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
with
tons
of
massive
flecks
of
yeast
and
a
medium
white
head
aromas
are
somewhat
subdued
but
i
pick
up
bready
malts
with
a
zesty
orange
smell
taste
is
interesting
its
hoppy
in
a
citrusy
way
with
fruity
malts
making
less
of
an
appearance
than
my
palate
was
hoping
its
too
bitter
and
too
chewy
to
be
sold
as
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
kudos
for
defying
expectations
but
i
hope
that
they
make
this
beer
more
balanced
in
the
future
d
not
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
but
one
i
would
probably
drink
again
i
think
this
would
be
a
fun
beer
to
drink
in
warmer
weather
d
fair
it
grows
on
me
as
i
drink
but
im
not
sure
it
would
ever
be
a
standby
for
me
you
need
to
be
careful
to
make
sure
you
dont
get
some
outdated
bottles
if
there
is
dust
on
them
beware
when
this
beer
gets
old
it
is
not
enjoyable
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
not
a
stand
out
choice
not
your
standard
run
of
the
mill
american
pale
ale
its
limited
drinkability
makes
this
a
beer
i
will
not
go
back
to
in
the
future
d
its
ok
but
there
other
beers
of
this
style
i
would
grab
before
this
nikki
in
the
end
this
was
a
nice
crispy
and
citrusy
pale
ale
session
beer
only
if
you
like
low
abv
citrusy
pale
ales
for
me
i
could
probably
go
for
another
one
light
bodied
pretty
high
carbonation
i
truthfully
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
expected
better
from
bells
there
are
far
better
options
available
for
this
style
of
beer
while
it
is
pretty
drinkable
i
cant
see
me
picking
anymore
of
these
up
overall
very
light
and
refreshing
brew
it
has
fairly
thin
body
but
still
manages
to
satisfy
goes
down
nice
but
left
me
feeling
totally
underwhelmed
and
lacking
not
worth

thats
for
sure
notes
i
know
it
says
pale
ale
but
was
a

turned
off
on
the
chunkiness
i
need
to
filter
this
in

the

head
lasts
pretty
well
but
i
have
no
idea
where
the
hops
have
gone
the
only
hint
of
them
is
the
bittering
in
the
finish
there
is
no
hop
flavor
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
also
doesnt
taste
like
an
apa
very
disappointing
especially
when
compared
directly
to
founders
superb
version
of
the
style
drinkability
is
good
these
could
probably
go
down
easy
however
i
could
only
find
this
in
6
packs
and
only
in
mi
the
price
was
high
for
what
it
is
too
in
the
future
i
will
spend
my
beer
on
something
with
a
little
more
zip
has
a
moderately
dense
mouthfeel
and
syrupy
finish
drinkability
is
moderate
on
this
a
little
disappointing
considering
the
rest
of
bells
lineup
not
much
of
a

character
well
balanced

the

clean
with

nuttiness
from
the
minor
addition
of
victory
malt
and
mild
hallertau
bitterness
there
has
to
be
cascade
hops
in
this
beer
no
way
the

will
give
that

love
the
favor
of
this
beer
looking
forward
to
a
trip
to
the
brewery
notes
i
prefer
two
brothers
the
bitter
end
to
this
one
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
large
yeasty
component
altogether
very
nice
worth
a
try
according
to
michael
jacksons
pocket
guide
to
beer
a
pale
ale
means
bronze
or
copper
colored
even
though
the
bottle
said
this
would
be
a
lighter
colored
brew
the
appreance
alone
turned
me
off
to
this
one
a
first
for
bells
starw
colored
with
mild
hops
little
carbonation
and
grassy
smell
this
almost
seems
like
they
bottled
this
one
wrong
too
many
great
bells
and
too
many
great
pale
ales
to
choose
this
one
again
this
beer
was
ok
and
i
should
note
that
my
mom
loved
it
but
i
expect
more
from
bells
and
wasnt
too
enthused
over
this
creamy
and
semisweet
to
start
but
the
hop
bitterness
and
mild
alcohol
warmth
provide
a
maltydry
finish
of
grain
and
light
resin
for
a
crisp
and
zesty
aftertaste
of
balanced
fruit
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
with
enough
grist
to
make
it
feel
full
in
the
mouth
another
easy
drinking
brew
from
bells
i
could
see
a
sixer
disappearing
from
my
fridge
quite
quickly
thanks
to

beer
for
a

pack
on
the

or
a
bar
b
que
worth
a
try
but
somehow
i
have
come
to
expect
more
from

pours
a
very
pale

hazy
nice

that

aroma
of
american

is

hops
that
dominates
over
the
pale

base
medium
bodied
the
hop
bitterness
lasts
a
long
time
and
burp
keeps
repeating
overall
an
ok
american
pale
ale
i
used
some
of
this
brew
in
a
marinade
for
flank
steak
and
the
end
result
was
beautiful
added
a
nice
fruity
touch
to
the
soy
sauce
i
also
used
i
might
drink
this
again
if
it
was
fresh
from
the
brewery
but
i
dont
reckon
id
try
it
again
otherwise
good

drying
finish
and
spice
aftertaste
including

easy
drink
not
their
best
but
a
good
effort
pours
out
a
straw
color
not
too
distant
from
the
typical
color
of
a
macro
here
is
where
the
similarities
stop
however
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
notable
floaties
in
the
body
of
the
beer
but
im
not
particularly
scared
away
by
such
things
aroma
is
strongly
citrus
with
hops
and
pine
serving
as
a
background
from
the
appearance
i
expected
this
offering
to
be
overcarbonated
but
i
was
wrong
the
taste
is
fairly
typical
of
the
style
strong
hop
notes
with
a
dry
finish
nothing
that
breaks
the
mold
but
still
a
very
pleasant
beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
weak
in
the
body
compared
to
many
others
in
the
style
but
not
enough
to
be
a
deterrent
drinkability
on
this
one
is
pretty
good
as
long
as
you
have
a
love
hops
very
cloudy
and
yellow
when
put
up
to
the
light
i
see
floaters
swimming
around
smells
very
much
of
floral
the
taste
starts
with
a
piney
spice
and
ends
with
a
hops
bitterness
other
taste
i
detect
are
citrus
orange
peel
with
this
beer
i
would
say
you
felt
like
you
drank
something
plenty
of
taste
drinkability
is
good
seeing
this
beer
is
neither
overthetop
or
shy
its
very
sharp
crisp
and
dry
all
the
qualities
i
love
in
a
pilsner
i
respect
bells
interpretation
of
this
style
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
pale
a
quality
offering
just
not
quite
for
me
pours
a
necw
yellow
with
the
nicest
white
head
you
will
find
anywhere
some
floaties
are
about
and
swirling
around
in
the
carbonation
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
with
a
touch
of
hops
present
no
defects
lively
fruity
flavor
with
plenty
of
hops
and
a
nice
malt
presence
hops
linger
on
the
palate
nice
mouth
feel
for
a
light
ale
with
perfect
carbonation
and
nice

this
is
one
easy
drinkin
brew
that
could
easily
be
consumed

it
foamy
white

sticks
around
and

little
too
light
for
this
style

of
grass
pale
malt
a
bit
of
lemony
hops
and
not
much
else
taste
is
creamy
with
lots
of
malt
however
it
quickly
leads
into
a
tannin
filled
bitter
metallic
taste
an
almost
honey
sweet
malt
taste
is
balanced
by
spice
and
a
little
citrous
hops
although
it
is
a
smooth
beer
the
drinkability
is
hampered
by
that
tannin
taste
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
in
an
apa
not
as
much
bite
like
others
in
this
style
exhibit
but
it
does
have
a
decent
malt
body
and
a
nice
dry
finish
medium

medium

the
finish
was
somewhat
dry
and
smooth
and
the
bitterness
and
citrus
stuck
out
most
here
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
pale

and
is
a
good
tasty
brew
you
can
drink
a
few
of
decent

moderate

a

its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
i
realize
i
like
it
more
now
than
i
thought
i
did
i
guess
i
just
had
to
sit
down
review
it
and
pick
it
apart
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
if
you
can
get
it
in
your
area
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
with
large
bubble
pockets
and
slight
carbonation
smells
of
mild
hops
and
wheat
with
mild
malt
underpinnings
smells
like
a
pilsner
light
hops
with
a
slight
spiciness
again
shades
of
a
pilsner
a
tiny
touch
of
fruit
apples
maybe
with
the
slightly
citrusy
hops
unfortunatly
it
gets
a
bit
watery
too
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
is
very
smooth
and
light
a
good
summer
beer
but
as
i
sit
here
and
drink
it
its
grade
starts
to
slip
the
wateriness
becomes
a
bit
too
apparant
overpowering
the
otherwise
very
nice
flavor
pushes
the
definition
of
apa
at
least
in
regards
to
my
other
experiences
in
the
genre
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
there
are
some
floaties
present
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
with
some
citrus
hops
dominating
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
very
bitter
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
american
pale
ale
it
has
good
aroma
and
flavor
although
they
could
use
some
body
and
munich
malts
mouth
was
oily
and
left
a
small
hint
of
bread
i
may
have
this
agin
but
i
doubt
ill
pay
for
it
so
which
is
it
as
an
apa
i
find
bells
pale
ale
to
be
lacking
as
a
blonde
ale
it
aint
half
bad
i
guess
ill
just
score
it
on
its
own
merits
regardless
of
style
ive
had
much
better
beer
from
bells
but
this
one
is
still
enjoyable
in
its
own
way
this
is
the
most
mainstream
of
the
bells
i
tried
its
smell
is
quite
mild
but
the
taste
is
better
while
i
dont
think
it
is
that
bitter
it
has
a
good
hoppy
quality
but
i
would
expect
to
be
able
to
smell
that
too
weird
this
pale
ale
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
pours
cloudy
yellow
color
and
chunky
white
head
with
great
lacing
very
big
on
the
citrus
hops
right
off
the
nose
taste
is
very
citrusy
up
front
with
nice
yeast
flavor
mixing
around
in
there
very
crisp
beer
thats
almost
a
creamy
texture
goes
down
really
smooth
a
very
drinkable
pale
but
nothing
incredible
here
dn
another
fine
offering
from
larry
very
nice
tastes
and
smells
and
the
fact
that
its
unfiltered
lends
it
an
interesting
look
nicely
done
pours
a
cloudy
hefeweissen
yellow
with
a
great
coarse
and
fluffy
head
very
slight
smell
floral
and
i
could
swear
a
hint
of
stale
marshmellows
great
taste
like
a

hearted
which
decides
to
take
the
afternoon
off
to
2hearteds

have
sour
citrus

underwritten
by
vegetal
hints
which
make
for

more

bow
out
half
way
through
to
a
long
bitter
finish
the
carbonation
is
as
spunky
as
2heartd
i
might
just
prefer
this
pale
ale
if
im
not
in
the
mood
to
pucker
my
tongue
for
the
night
this
pale
ale
poured
a
hazy
golden
peach
color
with
creamy
smooth
white
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
fruity
and
malty
with
a
nice
mild
hop
aroma
and
traces
of
grain
and
yeast
the
taste
was
a
sharp
malt
and
hop
flavor
almost
lagerlike
with
some
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
soapy
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
crisp
and
dry
and
hoppy
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
pale
ale
overall
i
had
no
problem
with
this
one
but
wouldnt
reach
for
another
too
quickly
not
bad
not
bells
best
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
generally
good
and
drinkablity
is
good

citrus
this
is
the
first
beer
from

i
taste
it
is
not
so
bad
but
i
think
they
have
better
ones
one
nice

it

a
hazy
dirty
gold
with
a
nice
white
inch
high

with

citric
with
a

that
sticks
around

coats
the

about

my
first
beer
of
the
evening
and
anxiously
anticipating
it
something
there
is
about
a
nice
bitter
beer
after
an
air
flight
arrived
in
my
glass
as
the
last
of
the
head
melted
into
the
golden
yellow
beer
the
head
that
remained
did
a
good
job
clinging
onto
my
glass
some
stayed
on
the
glass
from
my
first
sip
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
mandarine
oranges
and
hops
with
a
refreshing
bitter
finish
very
flavorful
overall
with
pine
cone
hop
flavor
obliterating
the
pale
malt
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
but
found
all
the
floaties
a
bit
disconcerting
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
another
one
of
these
this
is
better
than
say
coors
but
thats
about
all
the
compliment
i
can
give
it
this
pours
a
very
pale
strawgolden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
there
was
some
lace
throughout
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
slightly
grassy
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
also
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
some
hop
bitterness
mainly
citrusy
tasting
this
was
pretty
drinkable
but
overall
not
very
impressive
there
didnt
seem
to
be
very
much
malt
character
in
this
brew
and
the
hops
did
not
taste
very
fresh
i
guess
this
was
an
ok
beer
i
will
stick
to
stouts
from
bells
pretty
drinkable
but
its
not
really
my
thing
blonde
ale
with
a
creamy
white
head
topping
it
off
nice
floral
aroma
along
with
a
spicey
note
of
hops
the
spices
standout
and
are
quite
noticable
without
being
overpowering
the
taste
is
again
a
nice
blend
of
floral
and
spicey
hops
with
a
dry
pale
malt
bite
very
good
taste
the
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
spice
that
remains
tasty
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
still
a
one
to
enjoy
hazy
gold
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
dissapears
smells
of
hops
but
nothing
that
strong
this
is
a
pale
ale
that
is
not
nearly
strong
enough
for
my
tastes
i
need
more
hops
not
that
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
maybe
its
because
i
just
had
chili
who
knows
ng
not
bad
but
defnitely
not
amongst
bells
best
still
a
decent
if
uneventtul
pale
ale
and
id
probably
have
one
again
appearance
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
tone
with
a
vibrant
white
two
finger
sized
head
leaving
fine
scattered
lacing
nice
appearance
aroma
grapefruit
in
nature
with
underlying
floral
spiced
hops
mild
grassy
malt
notes
very
mellow
but
nice
taste
up
front
bitter
with
a
bread
malt
tone
a
bit
one
dimensional
with
the
upfront
zesty
bitterness
but
overall
a
decent
brew
from
bells
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
steady
carbonation
a
bit
oily
from
the
hop
resins
drinkability
not
overly
impressed
by
this
pale
golden
ale
from
bells
its
alright
just
not
something
i
would
crave
very
drinkable
especially
at
5
0
another
please
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
nebulous
golden
yellow
with
a
persistent
frothy
white
head
that
erodes
and
leaves
behind
a
fine
sheet
of
lace
sweet
and
kind
of
biscuit
like
aroma
at
the
front
crisp
fresh
and
lightly
hop
floral
appealing
this
nose
sweet
malt
start
top
moderate
in
body
finish
is
pesky
in
its
acidity
hops
are
delightful
in
their
muted
presence
with
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
i
certainly
wish
we
had
a
local
source
for
this
great
breweries
beer
maybe
i
need
to
lobby
the
distributors
here
more
than
i
already
do
drinkablity
hops
on
the
taste
but
not
the
nose
a
nice
little
beer
great
prelude
of
what
was
to
come
thanks
to
fm
for
supplying
this
one
much
appreciated
cloudy
and
hazy
light
orange
color
has
a
decent
white
creamy
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
in
my
glass
light
citrus
and
bready
aroma
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
flavors
of
bread
butterscotch
and
grapefruit
finishes
clean
with
a
light
bitterness
the
bells
pale
ale
was
disappointing
in
appearance
although
the
body
was
a
clear
light
ambergold
the
head
was
less
than
one
finger
high
anf
the
lacing
was
virtually
nil
the
nose
was
light
but
gave
botha
small
hop
sense
and
then
a
stroger
malt
backbone
was
revealed
as
the
brew
warmed
the
taste
was
ok
but
not
impressive
being
bitter
without
a
nice
cirtrus
sense
nor
other
discernible
flavor
the
feel
was
good
and
the
drinkability
was
quite
obvious
although
more
from
the
feel
than
the
flavor
thanks
go
out
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
sample
this
brew
was
a
little
disapointing
i
had
heard
so
much
about
bells
i
guess
i
should
have
got
one
of
their
bigger
beers
it
was
awfully
pale
in
color
the
smell
was
nice
with
the
hops
sneaking
out
to
say
hello
the
hops
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
to
balance
it
out
nicely
bottle
conditioned
too
which
i
thought
was
a
little
odd
for
such
a
light
beer
but
i
guess
sn
pale
is
as
well
pale
goldenorange
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
diminishes
into
a
thin
lace
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
in
the
glass
ok
so
i
cant
pour
i
wont
blame
them
for
that
lots
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
aroma
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
citrusy
and
yeasty
i
didnt
expect
all
the
yeast
flavors
from
a
pale
ale
but
it
still
tastes
good
so
im
not
complaining
a
very
drinkable
smooth
and
perfectly
hopped
pale
ale
it
does
not
jump
out
as
too
hoppy
and
has
a
clean
light
orangish
color
to
it
the
light
citrusy
cents
blend
well
with
the
hops
smooth
and
not
too
carbonated
but
enough
to
be
refreshing
bells
does
a
great
job
with
their
beers
and
the
pale
is
no
exception
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
tall
pillowy
white
head
that
leaves
spider
webs
of
lace
across
the
glass
as
it
slowy
dissipates
very
aromatic
with
notes
of
floral
hops
citrus
zest
and
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
dominated
by
bitter
grapefruit
rind
hops
with
some
biscuity
malts
in
the
background
as
the
beer
warms
some
notes
of
grain
husks
become
apparent
solid
mouthfeel
this
was
a
nice
pale
ale
and
good
choice
as
a
session
beer
just
dont
let
it
get
too
warm
or
the
grain
tannins
become
overpowering
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
sample
sharp
mouthfeel
especially
in
the
back
of
the
throat
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
orange
slightly
hazy
with
lots
of
floating
yeast
there
are
three
huge
fingers
of
head
that
die
slowly
there
is
lots
of
lace
left
the
smell
is
full
of
citrus
and
hops
the
aromas
fill
the
nose
nicely
the
taste
is
a
bit
malty
and
yeasty
at
first
then
it
moves
on
to
a
fruity
finish
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
not
too
bad
the
drinkability
is
nice
though
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
refreshing
and
tasty
but
just
a
bit
above
lawn
mower
class
however
this
particular
bottle
is
just
a
little
off
with
a
light
aroma
of
cooked
veggies
it
is
otherwise
a
maize
colored
fairly
clear
pale
ale
with
a
good
but
not
overwhelming
spicy
kick
of
hops
a
lighter
beer
than
youd
think
but
this
just
makes
it
more
quaffable
and
in
my
mind
more
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
may
not
be
as
hearty
and
fullbodied
as
some
other
pales
ales
but
ii
still
like
it
its
a
bit
expensive
for
such
a
light
bodied
pale
but
as
a
homebrewer
i
harvest
the
yeast
sediment
for
some
of
my
own
brews
which
makes
the
expense
worth
it
not
usually
being
a
fan
of
the
bells
products
i
tried
this
one
with
a
negative
outlook
had
it
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
or
no
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
fruity
very
similar
to
most
ipas
the
taste
was
a
little
spicy
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
fairly
average
ipa
taste
nothing
too
special
in
my
opinion
the
drinkability
was
run
of
the
mill
thanks
to
tavernjef
for
sending
several
bell
products
this
is
a
pale
gold
color
beer
that
is
clouded
by
a
slight
presence
of
sediment
on
top
of
that
is
a
bubbly
white
head
which
leaves
a
nice
lace
trail
this
beer
has
a
pretty
fruitycitrusy
taste
topped
with
a
spicy
hop
precence
this
is
a
pretty
good
drink
not
my
alltime
favorite
but
worth
a
shot
if
you
run
into
it

served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
courtesy
of
tavernjef
who
sent
some
much
needed
bells
to
me
in
ct
fairly
golden
in
color
this
pale
only
a
bit
of
haze
little
bit
of
white
head
nothing
significant
low
to
moderate
carbonation
aroma
is
fairly
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
spice
taste
evolves
as
this
pale
warms
a
bit
starting
off
a
bit
yeasty
but
with
good
hoppy
bitterness
jumping
out
from
the
back
of
your
tongue
loving
the
bottle
conditioned
smoothness
finishes
with
notes
of
citrus
and
spice
fairly
dry
good
example
of
an
intelligent
pale
ale
excellent
artwork
on
the
bottle
as
well
if
it
wasnt
for
the
dominating
grainy
tannins
this
would
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
however
as
it
stands
this
is
a
one
beer
beer
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
though
pours
a
flourescent
orange
color
with
little
head
that
soon
left
and
there
was
no
lacing
to
be
found
the
yeast
was
strong
flavored
here
and
provided
a
citrusy
aroma
and
taste
hops
seemed
to
be
more
floral
in
taste
and
definitely
strong
finishes
with
a
mouth
puckering
hop
kick
everything
about
this
beer
tells
me
its
average
for
a
pale
ale
thanks
to
realale
for
the
fresh
sample
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
this
one
and
overall
id
say
its
a
solid
pale
ale
it
pours
out
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
almost
nothing
malt
dominates
the
nose
and
has
a
sweet
bready
almost
biscuity
aroma
with
some
help
from
the
yeast
hops
are
there
but
barely
play
a
supporting
role
good
texture
on
the
tongue
and
a
proper
medium
body
again
malt
takes
the
stage
with
bread
and
some
fruit
hop
flavor
is
very
detectable
with
some
earthy
tones
and
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
not
a
whole
bunch
going
on
here
with
this
beer
but
a
good
pale
ale
needs
not
be
overly
complex
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
could
only
get
more
of
it
here
in
virginia
purchased
at
the
brewery
general
store
on
july
3
2003
this
beer
poured
virtually
no
head
the
lacing
was
good
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
hue
of
this
beer
is
light
yellow
and
the
nose
is
spicy
i
was
disappointed
in
this
brew
as
i
thought
it
would
be
much
better
than
it
was
this
is
another
one
of
my
not
a
bells
favorite
of
mine
overall
a
good
drinking
brew
welcome
back
bells
another
questionable
bottle
of
bells
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldorange
color
topped
by
a
loose
off
white
head
and
highly
sedimented
the
aroma
is
nice
with
strong
malts
and
a
nice
floral
aroma
notes
of
orange
in
the
nose
as
well
actually
very
nice
and
fruity
the
taste
is
more
lagerlike
than
ale
like
with
a
sharp
malt
taste
finished
by
a
crisp
hoppiness
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
no
souring
or
wet
cardboard
flavors
to
hint
at
an
old
or
spoiled
bottle
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
agressive
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
nose
this
brew
has
a
very
mild
aroma
almost
nonexistent
it
has
a
light
yellow
orange
body
with
no
head
and
great
lacing
it
also
has
a
bit
of
an
after
bite
i
found
it
impossible
to
describe
the
taste
it
was
an
ok
brew
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
bells
taste
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
some
hoppiness
that
doesnt
dominate
but
you
know
its
there
all
in
all
a
great
session
beer
hopefully
with
all
of
these
great
beers
bells
will
distribute
out
my
way
one
of
these
days
looks
just
like
a
wheat
beer
cloudy
deep
golden
color
with
small
white
head
of
foam
smells
kind
of
yeasty
with
a
slight
floral
aroma
very
crisp
and
effervescent
flavor
is
a
little
stale
with
a
slight
bitterness
not
one
of
the
best
pales
ive
had
would
prefer
a
little
more
hop
presence
reminds
sme
of
one
of
my
homebrews
i
used
to
make
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
brews
this
brewery
seems
to
be
inconsistant
in
my
opinion
they
have
some
stellar
brews
and
some
like
this
one
just
doesnt
impress
me
what
a
spectacular
looking
beer
pours
a
creamy
head
looks
like
a
mogulcovered
ski
slope
except
its
not
downhill
it
looks
like
there
is
a
storm
in
the
cloudy
peachcolored
beer
the
head
refuses
to
settle
its
there
as
i
drain
the
glass
smells
wheaty
and
slightly
of
apricot
tastes
fantastic
this
may
be
best
traditional
pale
ale
i
have
had
very
complex
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
i
think
i
need
to
head
to
kalamazoo
ill
bring
my
kazoo
notes
judging
from
several
of
the
other
reviews
it
appears
that
some
question
this
being
a
pale
alebitter
i
also
found
it
very
mild
in
the
bitterness
category
but
i
also
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
pours
to
a
orangishcopper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
has
a
huge
blast
of
fruity
citrus
hop
aroma
has
a
different
flavor
almost
nutty
with
fruitiness
it
flows
to
a
very
dry
and
bitter
finish
it
is
medium
in
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
another
tasty
brew
from
bells
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
especially
after
being
so
impressed
by
most
of
the
other
bells
brews
i
have
tried
pours
an
almost
sickly
looking
light
orange
color
with
a
thin
and
foamy
white
head
very
floral
hops
aroma
with
light
citrus
notes
as
well
flavor
is
mild
with
perfumy
hops
and
light
malt
finish
is
crisp
and
light
with
a
nice
hops
presense
lingering
okay
but
gimme
an
expedition
next
time
one
really
nice
pale
and
quite
unique
f
its
pretty
cloudy
and
straworange
in
color
the
head
is
huge
has
a
good
retention
and
awesome
lacing
what
a
kick
ass
aroma
this
has
its
citrusy
and
yeasty
i
really
enjoy
it
theres
a
wonderful
smoothness
to
this
beer
medium
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoy
the
spicy
hop
character
also
fruity
in
a
way
this
character
follows
pleasant
malt
character
its
kind
of
odd
for
the
style
to
me
but
i
really
enjoy
it
regardless
its
an
awesome
beer
chunky
murky
pale
orange
appearance
with
a
lighter
12
inch
head
of
medium
bubbles
laces
in
rings
grassy
hop
aroma
quite
evidently
mixed
with
an
oiled
pizza
dough
yeastiness
semicoating
and
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
mid
caramel
malt
bill
supplemented
by
a
nectarine
fruitiness
hops
tend
toward
an
slightly
astringent
citrus
and
are
evident
mid
mouth
onward
good
balance
whats
really
evident
here
is
the
yeasty
breadiness
welcome
in
many
of
the
kalamazoo
stouts
but
somewhat
strange
here
as
in
the
sparkling
ale
as
well
so
im
a
fence
sitter
balanced
but
somewhat
odd
flavor
a
somewhat
reserved
pale
ale
but
very
well
crafted
and
quite
drinkable
citrusyfloral
hops
were
judiciously
administered
and
well
balanced
by
a
lightly
toasted
malt
tended
to
lean
a
little
toward
the
english
interpretation
very
clean
and
refreshing
a
good
session
ale
strikes
me
as
a
good
transition
beer
to
build
a
nonhopheads
tolerance
and
appreciation
for
two
hearted
ale
the
press
grille
this
beer
poured
a
hazycloudy
yellow
colorchilled
glass
did
not
helpnote
to
bartender
after
i
get
to
know
him
betterand
had
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
it
had
an
aroma
of
hops
citrus
and
slightly
of
malt
a
flavor
of
hops
citrus
and
bread
the
finish
was
light
an
a
touch
astrigent
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
this
is
not
a
good
example
and
a
rare
miss
for
bells
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
polished
plenty
of
better
pale
ales
out
there
imo
pours
a
slightly

cut

and
spices
flavor
begins
as
bread
dough
then
becomes
herbal
and
bitter
the
flavors
balance
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
just
slightly
rough
and
somewhat
oily
with
a

this
is
a
most
excellent
pale
ale
that
i
could
drink

a
hazy
yellow
very
little
head
that
fades
to
zero
and
virtually
no

faint
smell
of
sweet
hops
slightly
bready
the
taste
reveals
very
little
carbonation
light

slightly
spicey
not
too
much
going
on

a
short
slightly
hoppy
finish
strange
i
have
the
expedition
stout
in
the
wings
that
i
am
looking
foward
to
but
this
one
falls
short
the
colors
that
of
ripe
apricot
the
head
a
solid
stocky
white
aromas
are
explosive
spinning
off
citrus
primarily
grapefruit
orange
lemon
and
a
whiff
of
spice
a
downright
friendly
finish
that
meets
you
and
greets
you
and
treats
you
right
awash
in
bitter
but
fruity
flavor
with
a
sensational
and
long
lasting
drizzle
of
hops
fresh
seafoamy
nose
light
body
excellent
texture
and
mouthfeel
full
of
that
unexplainable
effervescence
that
permeats
all
of

ales
its
got
to
be
that
yummy
yummy
yeast
one
hell
of
a
great
pale
ale
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
a
white
head
nice
hopiness
with
enough
maltiness
to
back
it
up
a
really
solid
version
of
the
style
another
solid
brick
in
the
foundation
of
a
rock
solid
brewing
company
enjoyed
on
tap
12902
pured
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
strong
hops
aroma
was
clearly
noticable
on
the
nose
and
accompanied
by
an
overwhelming
citric
grapefruit
taste
the
presence
of
malts
providing
any
balance
to
this
brew
was
undiscernible
one
pint
was
enough
for
me
hazy
gold
body
with
a
thick
almost
creamy
head
head
fades
surprisingly
fast
but
never
disappears
altogether
smell
is
a
bit
grassy
with
bready
caramel
malt
and
citrus
hops
good
smell
but
a
little
weak
well
balanced
flavor
neither
the
caramel
malt
nor
the
hops
really
takes
full
control
in
the
taste
caramel
malt
is
a
bit
biscuity
and
the
hops
are
bitter
and
citrusy
finishes
oily
and
bitter
rough
oily
mouthfeel
for
this
excellent
session
brew
its
a
little
paler
than
i
was
expecting
from
bells
a
lot
of
pas
are
darker
than
this
beer
it
does
have
that
nice
wet
clingy
head
that
i
love
pale
ales
to
have
though
the
aroma
is
mostly
the
hops
a
bit
thin
and
astringent
but
not
unpleasant
i
was
a
little
worried
at
the
taste
had
the
brewery
i
had
come
to
expect
for
big
malty
beer
let
me
down
turns
out
the
light
color
had
less
to
do
with
lack
of
malt
than
with
the
color
of
the
malt
used
the
malt
flavors
dominate
early
on
as
the
beer
warms
the
thin
bitter
hops
dominate
the
beginning
finishing
with
the
crisp
malt
not
my
favorite
apa
but
far
from
a
mediocre
example
of
the
style
one
thing
though
if
youre
expecting
the
huge
hoppiness
of
a
lot
of
the
really
popular
apas
this
is
a
bit
mild
for
a
good
fruity
apa
check
out
hair
of
the
dog
ruth
this
pales
in
comparision
palest
of
all
gold
at
first
theres
an
impression
of
brown
sugar
on
the
nose
with
candied
lemon
in
the
background
then
the
kaleidescope
shifts
and
there
is
a
custardlike
egginess
predominant
then
once
more
it
reconfigures
as
a
freshly
opened
can
of
creamed
corn
corn
and
milk
the
attack
is
of
overripe
citrus
bright
clear
flavors
of
cane
pancakes
and
lemon
marmelade
with
sunny
hayfield
notes
weaving
in
to
linger
this
beer
was
easy
to
pick
out
in
the
lineup
for
that
trademark
bells
signature
flavor
i
love
kzoo
beers
but
this
one
i
am
not
as
high
on
as
others
it
is
very
unique
though
as
it
almost
has
some
belgian
qualities
to
it
a
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
big
thick
head
smell
is
yeasty
as
youd
expect
with
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
also
some
sourness
on
the
nose
taste
has
some
biscuit
breadiness
to
it
and
some
real
spicy
hop
accents
maybe
even
some
subtle
smokiness
to
it
similar
to
batch
5000
in
that
regard
but
toned
down
about
onethousand
times
one
of
the
more
unique
pale
ales
but
not
my
bag
of
tea
nice
to
try
and
solid
in
its
own
right
but
i
like
many
others
better
nowhere
near
two
hearted
ale
in
my
opinion
drinkability
very
quaffable
cloudy
orangishyellow
pour
with
very
fine
head
that
gives
way
to
a
persistent
lace
that
lasts
the
glassful
even
when
well
chilled
the
aroma
is
striking
with
citrus
and
hops
hinting
at
the
surprisingly
strong
flavors
that
await
a
nice
hoppy
sharpness
with
some
of
the
fruitiness
giving
way
to
a
hint
of
toastiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
without
being
slimy
i
first
enjoyed
this
beer
from
a
keg
and
it
seems
nothing
is
loss
in
its
translation
to
a
bottle
cheers
to
deuce
for
the
sample
pours
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
tiny
bits
of
yeast
suspended
and
a
perfect
sized
pillowy
white
head
that
last
most
of
the
way
down
the
glass
light
floral
and
spicy
hops
smell
the
hops
attack
the
tongue
first
thing
but
are
then
nicely
followed
by
just
enough
malt
to
balance
this
one
the
spicy
hops
make
this
refreshing
and
crisp
and
a
great
summertime
brew
extremely
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
thanks
to
deuce
for
the
sample
i
thought
the
aroma
was
huge
i
could
smell
the
citrushop
with
the
bottle
a
foot
from
my
nose
on
the
palate
a
decent
malt
backdrop
and
i
thought
the
hops
were
pretty
dominant
but
not
totally
overpowering
i
agree
with
bighuge
a
pretty
unique
version
of
a
pale
ale
good
stuff
ive
been
into
so
many
different
specialty
brews
from
kalamazoo
over
the
past
couple
of
years
that
i
hadnt
realized
it
had
been
years
since
i
tried
some
of
their
run
of
the
mill
brews
thanks
to
davo
for
leaving
one
behind
for
me
in
our
trade
wow
i
sure
do
miss
bells
back
home
mount
pleasantmi
wow
great
headnice
subtle
hop
maybe
to
little
for
a
pale
ale
but
good
enough
yeasty
smell
is
wonderful
would
like
a
six
pack
nowwell
back
when
i
drank
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
the
greatest
thing
ever
the
huge
billowy
thick
and
creamy
head
sits
atop
a
light
golden
bubbly
brew
good
clarity
although
there
are
yeast
particles
from
the
apparent
bottle
conditioning
the
signature
but
subtle
fruity
almost
pearlike
esters
from
bells
yeast
strain
are
discernible
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
the
centennial
hop
nose
is
citrusy
and
a
touch
grapefruity
the
hop
nose
is
reminescent
of
a
subdued
two
hearted
ale
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
hop
bitterness
is
mild
to
moderate
for
a
pale
and
a
firm
malt
character
manages
to
assert
itself
into
the
flavor
profile
slightly
leafy
hop
flavor
the
finish
is
very
clean
with
a
pleasant
nuttiness
and
mild
hop
bitterness
although
this
isnt
as
distinctive
as
other
bells
brews
this
pale
is
finely
balanced
as
the
risk
of
sounding
esoteric
this
beer
tastes
like
a
mix
of
liberty
ale
and
odells
cutthroat
pale
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
pale
ale
style
as
the
six
pack
container
says
you
sprain
a
taste
bud
good
stuff
overall
theres
no
way
this
is
an
apa
and
not
an
ipa
allinall
a
decent
beer
that
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
at
least
for
me
so
piney
and
dank
an
amazing
american
pale
ale
duet
for
me
was
really
worth
the
hype
this
one
was
also
really
good
but
less
exceptional
i
think
less
amazing
and
unique
is
for
sure
but
still
a
really
trusty
ipa
that
i
would
happily
drink
all
the
time
if
it
were
available
here
unique
in
that
it
finds
the
floralpine
specturm
while
almost
entirely
skipping
citrus
sure
there
is
a
hint
of
orange
peel
even
candied
orange
peel
in
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
like
clover
and
pine
forest
with
no
citrus
in
between
usually
there
is
always
that
element
there
but
this
is
way
cool
in
that
its
polleny
and
blooming
but
also
hearty
and
sappy
its
balanced
but
its
big
too
and
although
the
hops
drive
the
flavor
there
is
definitely
a
moderate
toast
to
a
fuller
grain
body
really
really
nice
i
like
this
a
whole
lot
and
amazing
to
have
it
on
tap
for
the
first
time
but
i
just
dont
see
it
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
in
its
category
maybe
i
am
spoiled
but
for
me
its
a
level
below
the
hype
that
it
comes
with
super
solid
o
exceptionally
balanced
creamy
and
smooth
a
perfect
amount
of
light
crisp
mouthfeel
mixed
with
a
clean
hop
punch
i
could
drink
this
all
day
tried
this
at
the
yardhouse
in
la
beer
had
a
smokey
aftertaste
which
was
very
unusual
i
am
not
sure
if
something
was
not
wrong
with
the
beer
i
am
so
happy
that
alpine
brews
are
now
available
in
ma
never
got
to
have
this
one
out
in
ca
but
it
sure
is
a
great
one
finds
a
nice
balance
between
fruity
bitter
and
floral
and
every
sip
is
so
satisfying
and
flavorful
starts
with
nice
citrus
flavor
followed
by
earthy
spice
notes
a
tad
bit
of
wheat
well
balanced
can
tell
it
is
an
apa
as
it
is
missing
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
rather
crisp
and
dry
green
flash
version
the
nose
and
flavor
was
more
hop
forward
than
the
duet
drank
side
by
side
more
balanced
not
as
much
bitterness
as
it
warmed
the
hope
profile
came
through
more
and
it
became
more
pleasant
nice
dry
bitter
hop
bomb
less
sweet
thankfully
than
it
smells
nothing
wrong
with
the
feel
but
clearly
the
weakest
element
and
given
the
standards
set
by
the
likes
of
noble
or

used
to
the
big

bombs
here
on
the
east
coast
and
this
was
very
piney
to
me
nicely
balanced
but
just
not
my

in

been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
my
first
alpine
beer
on
tap
at
the
ale
house
amesbury
and
this
baby
didnt
disappoint
more
than
lives
up
to
its
lofty
rating
hoping
to
see
more
of
this
around
thanks

if
the

the

cheers
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
apas
available
hope
to
see
this
more
often
in
nyc
damn
good
lots
of
tropical
fruit
in
the
smell
super
flavorful
yet
light
and
delicate
this
is
right
up
there
with
nelson
this
is
probably
the
best
tasting
lighter
alcohol
beer
ive
ever
tasted
theres
an
aroma
of
orange
citrus
and
piney
notes
i
get
a
great
burst
of
flavorful
orange
citrus
as
well
as
a
subtle
grassy
hint
that
emerges
as
it
opens
up
and
some
christmas
tree
notes
too
the
bitterness
is
all
upfront
followed
by
a
dry
dry
dry
finish
this
was
exceptionally
well

this
has
been
one
of
my

i
had
the

the

galore
florally
tropical

some

that
could
easily
be

this

is
very
well
doneright
up
there
with

in

class
apas
for
me
lots
of

nearly
astrigently
dry

high

low
richness
chewy

long

aftertaste
of

i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
popular
so
tasty
and
so
drinkable
on

yes
have
wanted
this
brew
for
ages
poured
fairly
clear
thin

mild

sinks
into
my
schnozzola
and
delivers
bright

potent

citrus
along
with
some
more
east

tropical
fruit
and
juicy
notes
just
a
little
bit
of
neutral
maltiness
but
this
one
is
clearly
hop
perfume
the
flavor
is
simply
so
bright
and
lively
its
such
an
enjoyable
experience
very
complex
hoppiness
no
one
hop
descriptor
dominates
citrus
grass
pine
pineapple
some
passion
fruit
and
some

this
one
has
plenty
to
latch
on

with
a

and
a
long
lasting
hoppy

combo
medium

to

for
me
west

meets

hop
profile
one
hell
of
a
pale
ale
hoppy
birthday
is
an
immensely
flavorful
and
complex
american
pale
ale
that
truly
pushes
the
limits
of
the
style
now
that
alpine
beers
are
available
in
the
greater
bostonarea
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
offerings
my
favorite
alpine
beer
even
compared
to
the
others
on
tap
at
fireworks
pizza
during
the
alpine
launch
party
i
tried
to
go
into
this
tasting
with
an
open
mind
as
it
included
nelson
and
duet
and
i
had
never
tried
any
of
these
beers
hoppy
birthday
was
the
clear
winner
for
me
which
was
quite
a
surprise
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
such
a
full
bodied
hop
forward
satisfying
apa
this
would
be
the
alpine
beer
thats
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
if
i
had
the
option
i
know
some
are
unhappy
about
the
recent
agreement
to
brew
at
the
green
flash
facility
but
in
the
last
five
years
i
have
never
seen
alpine
on
tap
or
in
stores
now
i
am
suddenly
seeing
alpine
a
lot
of
places
and
the
three
i
have
tried
are
remarkably
good
i
dont
see
a
loser
here
unless
people
buy
less
green
flash
because
there
are
better
alternatives
o
so
fresh
hoppy
and
clean
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
on
tap
at
barrel
republic
hazy
orange
in
color
with
a
white
head
smells
earthy
with
some
pine
kinda
garlicy
taste
follows
the
nose
super
easy
to
drink
loads
of
dank
hops
some
tropical
fruit
mouthfeel
is
great
really
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
incredible
pale
ale
dare
i
say
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
final
score
4
49
dusty
with
less
hop
than
expected
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
a
lot
of
great
apas
edward
sierra
nevada
daisey
cutter
alpha
king
zombie
etc
this
one
is
in
my
mind
the
best
especially
for
a
good
session
incredible
citrus
nose
forward
but
not
overagressive
hops
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
i
understand
that
alpine
is
working
with
green
flash
now
to
increase
their
production
and
distribution
range
so
hopefully
this
will
become
available
more
easily
now

thanks
andrew
o
alpine
is
by
far
the
best
brewery
for
hoppy
beers
on
the
west
coast
in
my
opinion
picked
upa
bomber
of
this
brew
at
the
brewery
in
alpine
while
passing
through
from
san
diego
to
yuma
nice

nice

at
congregation
ale
house
ive
heard
great
things
about
this
and
it
did
not
disappoint
i
even
gave
some
to
a
nonbeerenthusiast
and
he
loved
it
sweet
malty
crisp
bitter
dry
smooth
citrus
refreshing
this
beer
is
a
solid
brew
if
you
find
it
get
it
o
wonderfully
balanced
full
of
complimentary
and
rich
flavors
really
enjoyable
however
it
becomes
extremely
bitter
as
it
warms
also
maybe
im
behind
on
hops
but
there
is
no
way
in
hell
i
would
call
this
an
apa
another
superdry
hop
bomb
from
alpine
this
one
low
enough
gravity
to
have
3
at
a
sitting
on
draught
at
the
rose
crown
palo
alto
cloudy
pale
orange
pour
with
a
finger
of
foam
which
persisted
until
first
taste
apricot
nose
and
orange
rind
no
appreciable
sweetness
a
perfect
ipa
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
4
25
lots
if
flavor
especially
for
a
pale
ale
almost
up
there
with
alpines
ipas
o
delicious
very
well
balanced
even
though
is
says
apa
this
is
an
ipa
to
me
love
the
hop
blast
up
front
and
how
it
finished
with
that
smooth
malt
sweetness
wish
i
could
get
this
in
bottles
o
impressive
but
then
again
its
alpine
this
is
a
real
treat
i
should
rate
this
higher
because
for
its
style
its
world
class
pale
ales
just
arent
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
they
made
an
outstanding
one
o
damn
near
perfect
for
the
style
insanely
crushable
yet
abundantly
flavorful
seems
like
this
was
the
session
ipa
before
the
style
was
coined
beautiful
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
i
walked
well
almost
ran
to
city
beer
store
when
i
saw
they
had
tapped
this
pours
somewhat
hazy
golden
slightly
darker
than
straw
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
white
head
aroma
is
well
balanced
though
amazingly
hoppy
for
a
5
5
pale
ale
what
really
sets
it
apart
here
is
that
super
fresh
hop
aroma
that
is
reminiscent
of
very
fresh
pliny
big
piney
dank
hops
overwhelm
the
senses
on
the
palate
there
is
big
grapefruit
up
front
that
turns
into
lots
of
piney
dankness
wow
this
is
dank
as
hell
for
a
pale
and
also
more
bitter
than
i
expected
similar
hop
profile
to
duet
imho
just
accentuated
in
different
ways
a
delight
and
lives
up
to
the
high
expectations
world
class

a

a
flavorful
and

thats
perfect
for
a
sunny
ca
day
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
pending
green
flash
treatment
of
this
excellent
ale
and
to
see
how
the
ratings
go
once
it
sort
of
hits
the
masses
this
is
what
the
so
called
session
ipas
should
be
imo
besides
the
great
name
this
beer
also
has
an
incredible
taste
overall
with
a
pour
of
hazy
yellow
and
a
thin
head
aromas
include
hops
grapefruit
and
orange
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
caramels
and
citrus
the
aftertaste
has
a
little
bitterness
o
i
tasted
this
beer
knowing
it
had
a
score
of
100
on
ba
it
still
blew
my
mind
and
it
made
me
reconsider
the
style
of
american
pale
ales
there
is
still
much
i
do
not
know
i
havent
had
it
but
im
assuming
that
this
is
the
west
coast
zombie
dust
a
mouthfeeloverall
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
good
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
alpine
very
tasty
with
an
abundance
of
hop
flavor
big
thanks
to
imyourhero21
and
loweball727
overall
didnt
impress
at
first
but
turns
out
to
be
a
more
than
solid
beer
between
really
good
and
great
a
must
try
for
apa
fans
with
that
said
my
rating
stays
with
the
original
hoppy
birthdays
ive
had
a
superb
pale
ale
out
of
the
brewery
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
really
easy
drinking
but
with
enough
character
to
make
it
really
good
overall
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
and
some
serious
hoppiness
o
amazing
apa
one
of
the
best
ones
out
there
worth
the
2
hour
drive
to
get
alpine
just
sexy
so
smooth
so
smooth
and
sexy
ruff
ruff
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
onion
and
garlic
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
and
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
was
a
damn
good
apa
one
of
the
best
ive
had
but
definitely
not
the
best
and
slightly
overrated
in
my
opinion
nice
balance
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
very
high
drinkability
but
i
still
prefer
some
of
alpines
other
offerings
duet
is
still
my
favorite
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
obtaining
it
high
b
pours
a
nice
medium
orange
fairly
cloudy
nice
big
white
head
lots
of
fine
foam
which
leaves
a
whole
bunch
of
lacing
behind
aroma
is
orange
tangerine
and
pineapple
lots
of
nice
hop
flavor
bouncing
around
im
not
getting
any
malt
character
really
smells
like
a
nice
clean
yeast
a
touch
of
mineral
water
flavor
lots
of
hop
flavor
in
the
taste
very
dry
just
a
hint
of
biscuity
malt
medium
bitter
the
dryness
amps
up
that
bitterness
some
in
the
finish
and
im
getting
some
solid
grapefruit
pith
and
pine
resin
tasty
stuff
very
refreshing
not
quite
as
bright
as
some
hoppy
palessession
ipas
mouthfeel
is
light
prickly
carbonation
good
hop
bite
o
just
an
amazing
amount
of
flavor
for
being
a
5
25
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
one
i
would
happy
sipping
on
all
day
o
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
very
well
balanced
great
flavors
hoppy
yet
not
at
all
overdone
quite
drinkable
glad
to
hav
tried
it
4

this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
grossly
exaggerated
example
of
an
overhopped
pale
ale
in
a
good
way
the
modest
level
of
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
light
body
that
at
times
is
watery
in
a
way
that
does
not
distract
from
the
experience
but
increases
its
overall
drinkability
i
am
pretty
sure
if
this
was
made
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
i
would
pound
it
the
depth
of
flavor
encapsulated
here
is
impressive
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
how
much
hop
flavor
it
had
without
being
excessively
bitter
for
an
apa
very
well
done

not
super
fresh
but
way
better
than
plenty
of
fresher
hoppy
beers
out
there
sweet
citric
aroma
with
oranges
tangerines
lemons
and
mild
stone
fruit
flavor
is
nice
and
tropical
grapefruit
and
orange
and
mango
a
hint
of
sweeter
malts
in
the
back
dry
finish
and
lightly
bitter
o
double
ipa
with
an
abv
of
a
american
pale
ale
awesome
session
beer
for
the
ipa
drinker
light
body
with
spritzy
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
beer
wow
i
never
thought
id
meet
a
rival
to
zombie
dust
today
i
have
poured
into
my
tulip
the
brew
is
a
beautiful
pale
orange
with
a
thick
one
inch
bright
white
head
that
leaves
curtains
of
webbing
as
i
drink
down
the
nose
is
amazing
pure
citra
hop
aromas
with
white
flowers
and
peaches
simply
one
of
the
best
noses
on
any
beer
ive
had
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
nose
with
concentrated
citrus
stone
fruits
some
bitter
hop
bites
and
a
beautiful
glance
of
light
biscuit
the
mouth
is
crisp
dry
and
cleanses
the
palate
with
perfect
carbonation
by
far
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
another
world
class
effort
from
my
favorite
brewery
on
the
planet
overall
this
is
an
amazing
bright
clean
well
balanced
fresh
pale
ale
i
love
zombie
dust
but
this
is
even
better
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
thus
far
itll
give
ipas
a
run
for
their
hops
to
be
sure
just
another
wonderful
example
of
what
alpine
can
do
with
hops
theyve
crammed
so
much
craftsmanship
into
a
beer
under
5
5
alcohol
overall
this
is
great
right
up
there
with
zombie
dust
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
this
would
be
really
nice
during
the
summer
o
what
a
killer
apa
they
dont
make
many
like
this
a
low
abv
hop
fest
though
i
still
find
3fs
zombie
dust
a
better
entry
and
one
of
my
alltime
favs
this
is
certainly
no
slouch
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
under
5
5
worth
seeking
out
and
heartily
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
awesome
beer
it
was
very
hoppy
and
bright
but
at
the
same
time
light
refreshing
and
drinkable
what
is
really
outstanding
about
this
beer
though
is
all
that
flavor
is
in
a
beer
with
abv
in
the
low
5
range
great
beer
overall
tastes
like
a
west
coast
iteration
of
an
apa
certainly
citrus
and
bitter
resiny
hops
dominate
a
meek
pale
malt
backbone
that
lends
a
wee
bit
of
sweetness
though
the
finish
is
dry
resiny
bitterness
all
the
way
light
feel
with
maximum
hop
delivery
would
easily
drink
a
couple
pints
of
this
schtuff
though
its
not
as
unique
as
some
of
alpines
other
beers
o
a
great
apa
glad
to
tick
this
one
thank
you
romulux
hoppy
bday
lands
safely
in
second
place
amongst
apas
thanks
to
the
sublime
zombie
dust
wish
i
could
get
this
regularly
o
definitely
the
best
apa
ive
had
to
date
cant
wait
to
try
zombie
dust
and
compare
the
two
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
apas
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
super
clean
filtered
and
lovely
white
lace
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
appearance
the
smell
is
hoppy
but
muted
even
with
the
head
strong
as
it
is
taste
is
hoppy
with
water
pine
and
citrus
and
toast
the
taste
finishes
clean
and
drying
and
is
seriously
well
balanced
sierra
nevada
still
wins
in
my
book
but
if
i
could
ha
e
this
all
the
time
it
would
be
serious
competition
happy
super
bowl
hoppy
birthday
thanks
martin
for
the
hookup
seriously
enjoyable
great
beer
cheers
and
go
pats
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
and
i
love
it
every
time
i
get
the
chance
to
have
it
light
and
refreshing
but
still
loaded
with
good
ipa
flavors
while
i
did
like
this
alpine
offering
and
can
understand
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
personally
would
have
prefered
a
finish
that
wasnt
so
dry
not
that
id
refuse
this
beer
if
you
bought
me
a
round
o
this
is
right
there
with
zombie
dust
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
i
keep
forgetting
how
low
of
an
abv
this
is
and
id
think
it
was
a
massive
ipa
based
upon
the
hops
if
i
didnt
know
better
over
all
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
market
this
poured
a
really
nice
orangeamber
color
displaying
excellent
clarity
and
effervescence
it
had
minimal
head
given
that
it
was
a
5
oz
pour
that
left
some
really
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
on
this
brew
is
insane
my
first
impression
was
oh
my
god
my
girlfriend
thought
i
found
a
bug
in
my
glass
haha
this
one
is
so
intensely
tropical
im
getting
big
peach
lemon
orange
and
mango
so
good
its
almost
unreal
the
taste
just
follows
suit
with
the
nose
very
heavy
on
the
tropical
citrus
fruits
peach
and
orange
taking
the
forefront
there
is
also
a
perfect
hop
bitterness
that
bites
the
tongue
which
is
very
piney
but
is
mellowed
out
by
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
this
leaves
a
really
nice
hop
oiliness
in
your
mouth
it
really
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
somewhat
dry
just
how
i
like
my
pale
ales
overall
i
am
going
to
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
pale
ale
i
have
had
so
far
i
really
wish
i
would
have
grabbed
a
growler
of
this
but
i
did
get
a
mixed
case
of
nelsonpure
hoppinness
so
i
cant
complain
and
theres
always
next
time
anyone
seeking
this
out
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
to
extreme
lengths
to
find
it
it
really
is
worth
it
cheers
i
cant
get
over
how
much
i
loved
this
offering
from
alpine
they
raised
the
bar
for
apas
with
this
one
a
great
pale
ale
and
one
of
the
hoppiest
i
have
come
across
in
fact
i
dont
think
you
can
pack
any
more
hops
on
top
of
such
a
light
malt
body
and
reserve
that
balance
this
one
even
tips
the
scales
on
the
bitterness
factor
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
ipa
another
fantastic
beer
from
alpine
and
one
of
the
best
single
ipas
ive
had
very
hoppy
and
fruity
and
i
felt
like
i
could
have
drank
the
whole
64
oz
growler
myself
would
love
to
have
it
again
and
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
lived
by
alpine
o
great
you
cant
ask
for
much
more
than
this
o
double
ipa
with
an
abv
of
a
american
pale
ale
awesome
session
beer
for
the
ipa
drinker
o
light
refreshing
and
lots
of
flavor
in
this
very
drinkable
pale
ale
hoppy
but
not
a
hop
bomb
another
light
but
flavorful
ale
from
alpine
t
somehow
the
taste
is
just
as
good
as
the
smell
a
hint
of
mango
and
then
a
big
hit
of
citrus
and
slightly
piney
hops
some
caramel
malts
balance
the
hops
before
they
can
get
too
bitter
and
the
finish
has
just
a
touch
of
pine
hop
resin
a
picture
perfect
pale
ale
must
get
more
overall
about
as
perfect
as
a
pale
ale
can
be
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
now
i
am
kicking
myself
in
the
ass
for
not
getting
a
growler
of
the
stuff
d
i
could
drink
this
everyday
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
alpine
and
that
says
a
lot
perfectly
made
overall
just
incredible
this
is
what
every
pale
ale
should
aspire
to
i
could
session
the
hell
out
of
this
if
the
abv
were
under
4
00
and
i
were
legally
allowed
to
do
so
by
british
law
reviewed
from
growler
into
tulip
pours
a
dark
gold
or
light
orange
with
a
fairly
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
much
fainter
then
i
had
expected
and
really
had
to
stick
my
nose
in
it
pun
intended
smells
sweet
citrus
and
almost
musty
the
taste
far
over
powers
the
smell
there
is
a
floral
bite
with
a
tangy
citrus
good
cabonation
with
a
fairly
dry
sticky
finish
great
beer
absolutely
perfect
sitting
out
enjoying
the
outdoors
overall
this
is
pretty
damn
good
there
are
four
pale
ales
i
find
worth
my
time
every
time
zombie
dust
edges
out
hoppy
birthday
on
my
personal
favorite
list
with
daisy
cutter
and
alpha
king
tied
for
a
distant
third
that
is
splitting
hairs
though
this
is
another
win
for
alpine
you
can
trust
them
to
do
right
by
the
hop
gods
pours
clear
light
to
medium
copper
in
color
a
somewhat
rocky
white
head
slowly
falls
back
to
a
ring
lacing
my
pint
glass
incredible
hop
aroma
a
mix
of
citrus
and
sweet
berries
ripe
sugary
sweet
grapefruit
like
youd
find
where
its
grown
not
bought
from
a
supermarket
tangerines
oranges
grass
hay
and
some
light
sugar
sweetness
in
the
aroma
as
well
one
of
those
hoppy
beers
where
you
are
continually
sticking
your
nose
into
the
glass
to
catch
more
of
the
aroma
taste
hits
up
front
with
some
orange
sweetness
cotton
candy
grapefruit
and
grassy
bitterness
towards
the
finish
light
to
medium
body
bitterness
is
pleasing
not
over
the
top
but
just
slightly
puckering
and
dry
to
keep
you
thirsty
a
perfect
balance
to
the
touch
of
malty
body
on
the
tongue
crisp
hoppiness
with
some
zing
left
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
this
after
5
days
across
country
in
a
growler
impressive
pale
ale
very
sessionable
delicious
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
very
clear
with
a
crisp
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
very
hop
forward
some
nice
light
citrus
and
floral
aromas
tastes
fruity
and
lightly
bittered
the
body
is
fairly
weak
but
well
carbonated
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
but
the
body
does
not
match
the
bitterness
well
o
what
an
awesome
pale
ale
i
cant
imagine
making
a
better
one
truly
alpine
doing
what
they
do
best
o
there
are
many
things
i
love
about
this
beer
but
above
all
this
is
truly
identifiably
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
hop
character
but
i
wouldnt
take
this
for
an
ipa
the
malt
really
has
strong
control
over
the
flavor
experience
a
wonderful
combo
of
pine
nut
malt
and
light
bitter
floral
hops
is
outstanding
this
is
a
member
of
the
nobility
of
the
summer
time
session
ale
kingdom
a
very
fancy
pale
ale
but
humble
with
simplicity
incredible
execution
here
by
alpine
the
perfect
pale
ale
its
astounding
that
so
much
hop
flavor
aroma
and
character
is
packed
in
to
this
sessionable
pitcherable
gulpable
5
25
pale
ale
drink
simply
put
damn
i
want
to
drive
down
to
alpine
and
get
another
couple
growlers
after
a
generous
ba
had
this
at
clusterfork
6
what
an
outstanding
pale
despite
its
big
hoppy
flavor
the
brew
retains
drinkability
good
to
the
last
drop
yo
a
very
good
beer
wouldnt
say
its
deserving
to
be
in
the
top
100
but
the
way
the
brhos
changed
the
list
rare
and
one
time
new
releases
are
bound
to
jump
into
the
list
at
the
expense
of
more
time
tested
and
available
stuff
id
put
it
midway
through
my
top
10
pales
poured
into
a
jester
king
snifter
and
i
can
smell
the
motherfucker
already
pours
golden
with
some
haze
along
with
a
bright
white
head
with
a
stream
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
hops
a
plenty
and
this
translates
beautifully
into
the
taste
lost
of
bright
citrus
with
no
malt
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
touch
thin
but
if
these
other
assholes
were
not
drinking
this
with
me
i
would
drink
all
64oz
myself
just
kidding
but
not
really
medium
lighter
body
decent
carbonation
dry
and
refreshing
while
drinking
this
is
easily
the
best
super
hopped
session
ale
ive
had
and
it
easily
surpasses
stuff
like
sd
county
session
gf
citra
and
others
i
wish
i
could
have
this
all
summer
beer
is
light
in
body
very
hoppy
the
malt
lead
off
is
nearly
nonexistent
it
is
very
nice
bitterness
is
about
60
ibu
thereabouts
great
finish
overall
a
superb
beer
id
have
it
again
and
again
o
awesome
beer
great
to
drink
pretty
much
anytime
anywhere
wish
i
could
get
this
regularly
awesome
o
amazing
just
an
amazing
beer
i
absolutely
love
alpine
o
this
beer
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
drank
and
is
another
huge
success
from
alpine
they
packed
so
much
flavor
into
a
small
apa
package
which
combines
for
the
most
flavorful
borderlinesession
beer
ive
ever
had
have
had
this
on
tap
more
times
than
i
can
count
on
my
hands
and
toes
the
color
is
golden
slightly
bronzed
and
always
carries
a
nice
frothy
airy
white
head
the
smell
to
me
is
more
of
a
green
earthy
smell
with
only
a
tiny
bit
of
citrus
hiding
in
the
background
the
hop
flavor
over
the
palate
is
spicy
slightly
juicy
again
just
a
touch
of
fruit
or
citrus
this
is
not
a
sweetbrightcitrusytropical
beer
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
as
to
be
expected
being
a
somewhat
smallbatch
beer
it
varies
a
bit
from
time
to
time
but
its
usually
a
must
get
anytime
we
see
it
o
a
really
nice
apa
expertly
hopped
and
infinitely
drinkable
o
fantastic
stuff
this
is
what
apa
and
hopcentric
should
aspire
to
be
4
53243
as
i
texted
to
ryan011235
that
i
was
drinking
this
my
auto
correct
took
over
and
i
sent
choppy
birthday
i
stand
by
that
moniker
i
think
its
more
accurate
im
not
sure
why
this
one
is
rated
so
high
oh
yeah
its
a
new
alpine
tap
only
duh
smells
grassy
with
a
shot
of
grapefruit
definitely
san
diego
style
taste
hits
you
with
a
dry
full
bitterness
at
first
but
after
your
tastebuds
are
shot
you
can
start
to
get
all
the
hop
flavor
lots
of
grassy
grapefruit
and
citrus
peel
reminds
me
of
making
a
hop
tea
its
like
they
boiled
this
thing
took
all
the
hops
they
used
and
squeezed
out
all
the
wort
from
them
and
fermented
that
instead
a
tiny
bit
of
toasty
caramel
to
relieve
your
tongue
low
to
moderate
carbonation
makes
you
think
the
beer
is
a
little
thicker
than
it
actually
is
the
mouthfeel
is
equally
as
good
full
and
meaty
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
surprise
beers
ive
ever
had
it
completely
blows
any
other
apa
out
of
the
water
and
there
are
some
really
good
apas
out
there
mediumthick
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
lingering
dry
hoppy
finish
sweet
and
juicy
ripe
tropical
fruits
dominate
from
the
start
and
dominate
throughout
amazing
again
maybe
not
a
great
apa
per
style
but
an
incredible
beer
regardless
this
growler
was
23
weeks
old
fresh
this
would
have
to
be
near
perfect
the
beer
appears
straw
yellow
and
slightly
hazy
the
head
is
thick
and
white
displays
lasting
retention
and
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
wow
one
of
the
best
aromas
in
a
pale
ale
i
have
ever
experienced
this
would
give
any
ipa
more
than
a
run
for
its
money
fresh
hops
and
a
blast
of
varied
citrus
the
flavor
is
absolutely
phenomenal
this
is
perhaps
the
most
drinkable
and
enjoyable
6
beer
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
perfect
ya
pretty
much
my
highest
recommendation
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
mikesgroove
for
sharing
this
one
at
an
impromptu
hobo
tasting
7
which
turned
out
to
be
a
good
time
in
an
ingles
parking
lot
out
of
the
trunk
of
my
audi
with
my
ar15
incheck
to
keep
the
haters
out
served
from
growler
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
and
a
very
subtle
roastiness
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
brew
just
plain
excellent
in
all
aspects
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
quite
some
time
and
glad
that
i
finally
was
able
to
the
nose
on
this
one
was
nothing
short
of
excellent
the
flavor
well
balanced
and
excellent
in
all
aspects
if
you
havent
gotten
your
hands
on
this
one
before
it
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
you
wont
regret
it
overall
one
of
the
best
most
drinkable
ipas
i
have
ever
come
across
this
was
just
nuts
i
would
like
to
see
someone
do
better
than
this
incredible
light
offering
that
seems
it
was
made
to
be
shared
d
this
hopforward
pale
ale
is
a
tourdeforce
bringing
a
showcase
of
west
coast
hop
flavors
into
effortless
balance
with
malt
acidity
and
a
texture
that
drinks
more
easily
than
water
most
comparable
to
strands
excellent
24th
st
pale
ale
hoppy
birthday
is
as
sharp
and
presentable
an
american
pale
ale
as
any
currently
brewed
very
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
hoppy
birthday
is
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
snow
white
foam
atop
it
the
head
recedes
leaving
some
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
distinctly
hoppy
and
hempy
definitely
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
smells
fantastic
the
taste
is
bitter
hops
with
muted
biscuity
malt
there
is
a
faint
citrus
presence
accompanying
the
bitterness
that
moves
this
apa
dangerously
close
to
ipa
territory
the
malt
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
the
bitterness
midpalate
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
without
lingering
too
long
very
nice
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
an
excellent
level
of
prickly
carbonation
wow
i
likey
at
5
2
abv
i
could
enjoy
this
in
copious
amounts
on
a
regular
basis
yet
another
incredible
alpine
ale
that
i
wish
was
bottled
and
available
year
round
highly
recommended
o
this
is
another
near
perfect
example
from
the
folks
at
alpine
imo
they
consistently
mark
the
standard
for
west
coast
hoppy
ales
delicious
and
well
crafted
flavors
that
play
perfectly
with
each
other
pours
a
super
clean
golden
amber
with
a
large
white
head
that
lingers
looks
fantastic
stronger
hops
come
off
the
nose
than
expected
pine
and
resin
maybe
a
touch
of
lemon
so
far
so
great
this
beer
is
more
straight
forward
bitter
than
any
apa
ive
ever
had
really
smooth
with
a
more
generic
hop
bitterness
than
the
nose
implies
thicker
than
expected
in
the
mouth
in
a
very
pleasing
way
with
solid
carbonation
they
did
a
great
job
disguising
a
5
25
abv
beer
in
the
mouthfeel
as
something
bigger
to
me
that
is
an
impressive
feat
aggressive
bittering
hops
limit
the
drinkability
slightly
as
an
apa
but
yet
it
otherwise
presents
itself
as
a
67
abv
beer
increasing
the
drinkability
quite
a
bit
with
its
lower
abv
really
one
of
the
best
23
apas
i
have
ever
had
a
fresh
growler
provided
by
alex
drank
from
a
cigar
city
snifter
the
body
is
a
bright
dark
clear
gold
with
a
beautiful
offwhite
head
the
head
rises
a
few
fingers
and
settles
with
a
nice
cap
decent
lacing
crystal
colors
and
contrast
looks
great
the
aroma
is
very
sharp
at
the
most
basic
level
its
a
mixture
of
cattydank
and
sweet
amarillo
like
hops
other
notes
of
pine
and
lemon
very
good
its
sweet
but
dank
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
more
of
steady
hops
throughout
not
super
bitter
though
light
grapefruit
on
the
front
this
is
an
apa
that
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
drinks
like
an
apa
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
flavorful
drinkable
5
beers
out
there
the
aroma
is
outstanding
well
worth
trying
the
aroma
is
more
of
4
75
and
taste
is
more
a
4
25
d
as
jason
would
say
this
is
absolutely
crushable
another
winner
from
alpine
d
wow
just
wow
an
awesome
apa
and
right
up
there
with
rr
parking
violation
drinks
like
an
ipa
without
the
abv
must
get
more
and
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
please
get
you
some
a
musttry
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
amber
color
with
a
twofinger
frothy
white
head
head
retention
is
very
good
as
is
lacing
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
really
shine
in
the
nose
with
pineapple
tangerine
and
mango
notes
coming
through
theres
a
nice
cracker
and
caramel
malt
aroma
underneath
the
hops
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
pineapple
mango
and
tangering
fruit
flavors
melding
nicely
with
a
substantial
cracker
malt
with
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
drinkability
is
offthecharts
here
this
really
hits
everything
i
look
for
in
a
sessionable
beer
the
flavors
are
refreshing
and
interesting
with
a
very
nice
balance
though
obviously
this
leans
to
the
hoppy
side
overall
another
incredible
hoppy
beer
from
alpine
every
time
i
try
something
new
from
this
brewery
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
this
might
nudge
alpine
slightly
ahead
of
russian
river
as
my
favorite
brewer
for
hoppy
beers
pours
a
clear
darker
strawgold
color
with
minimal
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
too
powerful
but
is
slightly
spicy
with
some
bitterness
in
there
it
is
lightbodied
with
generally
light
carbonation
tastewise
it
is
slightly
bitter
with
some
citrus
and
somewhat
astringent
pine
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
somewhat
yeasty
too
personally
i
thought
this
tasted
really
good
at
first
but
i
tired
of
it
rather
quickly
seemed
to
be
a
bit
too
much
yeast
in
it
and
i
suppose
it
didnt
impress
me
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
pales
pun
haha
to
alpines
other
similar
offerings
what
a
great
american
pale
ale
oh
and
i
guess
i
forgot
to
mention
it
but
theres
no
malt
character
present
but
given
that
this
is
a
hoppy
beer
from
alpine
that
description
is
rather
unnecessary
isnt
it
but
i
kid
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
light
biscuitcrackerlike
malt
flavor
but
it
does
nothing
but
provide
a
brief
respite
from
a
wonderful
hop
character
thanks
a
lot
chris
this
makes
99
of
the
ipas
out
there
superfluous
id
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
alpine
beers
yet
probably
up
there
with
nelson
and
obriens
ipa
the
last
beer
i
drank
a
growler
of
solo
in
one
sitting
was
younger
and
thats
very
high
praise
pours
a
moderate
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
nose
brings
forward
some
really
nice
tropical
floral
and
citrus
notes
it
seems
like
theyve
crammed
every
single
hop
variety
into
this
one
and
then
balanced
them
all
out
perfectly
the
taste
is
similar
with
some
really
well
defined
hop
notes
i
got
the
most
out
of
the
tropical
hops
though
amyliz4
got
more
from
others
this
is
just
stupendously
well
done
with
a
beautiful
balance
between
bitterness
and
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
best
apa
that
i
have
ever
had
thanks
again
mikei
really
owe
you
one
pours
a
golden
haze
with
a
white
head
with
some
nice
lacing
and
tiny
ropes
of
co2
rising
to
the
top
smells
like
strait
up
tropics
mango
pineapple
pommegranite
so
many
awesome
bright
fruit
smells
along
with
a
sweet
piney
aroma
tastes
light
and
maybe
even
a
little
too
much
so
for
a
beer
of
this
size
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
it
id
put
nelson
over
this
one
but
thats
just
mho
also
i
could
drink
this
for
days
is
there
a
better
pale
ale
out
there
poured
a
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
good
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aromas
were
just
like
most
of
other
ipas
consisting
of
a
great
hop
profile
pine
grass
citrus
grapefruit
slight
pineappple
and
some
good
malt
prssence
upfront
the
hops
and
pine
flavors
were
the
stara
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
slight
pineapple
costars
even
though
it
was
pretty
hoppy
the
malts
did
come
thru
to
balance
out
the
hop
bomb
which
was
is
really
a
pale
alegreat
job
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
nice
slight
sweet
but
bitter
hop
crisp
finish
it
drank
very
good
and
imo
can
become
a
epic
session
beer
chiilin
in
the
hot
socal
summer
sun
i
would
call
this
an
ipa
for
sure
and
may
be
my
new
favorite
alpine
ipa
they
need
to
crank
out
batch
after
batch
of
this
stuff
no
longer
on
for
tastes
or
growler
fills
in
the
tasting
room
d
this
was
an
all
around
delicious
beer
like
many
of
the
alpine
beers
they
really
have
hops
down
to
a
science
congratulations
on
this
lovely
beer
how
they
achieved
the
level
of
hop
complexity
without
any
malt
and
very
little
weight
or
abv
is
quite
intriguing
i
believe
it
is
a
citron
dry
hopped
apa
but
presents
more
like
an
ipa
overall
really
couldnt
ask
for
more
in
beer
easy
to
drink
lots
of
flavor
and
a
style
that
most
people
can
enjoy
a
must
try
cheers
flavor
follows
in
an
ipa
light
kind
of
sense
with
a
notable
hop
presence
throughout
a
citric
flavor
with
a
perky
carbonation
and
a
light
grainy
feel
a
bit
of
warming
suits
this
beer
well
as
an
initially
thin
feel
becomes
fuller
and
more
robust
finishes
with
a
bit
of
hop
infused
orange
malt
tones
offering
a
smooth
feel
drink
is
solid
but
held
in
check
by
the
one
sided
approach
for
a
pale
ale
quite
dry
and
hoppy
and
perhaps
out
of
balance
yet
give
me
another
d
this
is
one
of
my
new
alpine
favorites
so
brutally
hoppy
but
so
easy
to
drink
helped
along
by
a
moderate
abv
d
i
could
drink
this
everyday
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
alpine
and
that
says
a
lot
perfectly
made
growler
from
arthurpendragon
thanks
old
friend
the
beer
is
a
hazy
glowing
yellow
peach
color
an
inch
of
sudsy
frothy
foam
tops
the
body
and
retains
nicely
for
the
duration
of
the
glass
which
was
admittedly
brief
the
first
whiff
displays
huge
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
hop
aromas
pineapple
papaya
a
plethora
of
words
that
begin
with
p
also
mango
maybe
which
begins
with
m
malt
character
is
faint
possibly
even
imaginary
the
taste
is
explosively
hoppy
yet
quite
dry
and
nuanced
with
a
light
biscuit
malt
foundation
barely
perceptible
beneath
the
hops
the
hop
flavors
range
from
tropical
fruit
to
fresh
pine
needles
to
juicy
citrus
the
body
is
light
but
this
has
a
ton
of
flavor
it
finishes
with
a
silky
smoothness
only
moderately
bitter
really
and
with
incredible
balance
this
is
exceptional
superlatives
and
alpine
seem
to
go
hand
in
hand
very
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
tons
of
thanks
to
a
generous
benefactor
managed
to
guzzle
the
entire
thing
through
the
lost
finale
which
took
the
edge
off
a
very
underwhelming
close
to
the
series
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
with
an
upper
moderate
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
insane
highly
recommended
though
a
pale
ale
in
name
its
essentially
an
ipa
i
hope
they
decide
to
brew
this
again
awesome
stuff
this
american
pa
is
in
the
classic
british
style
and
is
very
well
done
highly
recommended
drinking
it
makes
me
really
appreciate
and
respect
the
brewers
efforts
to
protect
the
watershed
good
one
a
clean
and
lightly
hopped
apa
the
fresh
water
that
they
brag
is
retrieved
just
a
dozen
miles
away
really
does
seem
to
make
all
the
difference
not
very
aromatic
but
very
crisp
and
fresh
tasting
with
hops
that
are
very
not
overwhelming
very
drinkable
i
want
to
love
this
beer
and
feel
like
i
should
given
the
brewer
and
the
hop
bill
but
it
just
doesnt
hit
the
spot
for
me
solid
but
average
beer
this
is
a
legitimate
apa
though
and
i
feel
like
some
other
higher
rated
ones
have
clearly
crossed
into
the
ipa
category
o
good
hoppy
beer
to
drink
with
food
overall
im
interested
enough
to
try
another
bottle
on
another
day
if
you
inhale
while
sipping
youll
get
a
very
strong
grapefruit
aroma
which
carries
over
in
the
taste
overall
i
like
the
prima
pils
more
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
really
smooth
finish
there
is
a
pleasant
drinkability
that
helps
this
beer
go
down
easy
overall
a
very
easy
to
quaff

bright

strong

that
is
primarily
bread
and
biscuit
the
hops
come
right
out

to
be
a

the

light

and
relatively
dry
with
a
bitterness
that
falls
off
sharply
inviting
the
next
sip
a
highly
sessionable
beer
not
overly
complicated
but
crisp
and
clean
with
a
good
shot
of
bitterness
that
is
well
balanced
by
the
malts
a
great
example
of
what
a
pale

should
be
golden

good

aroma

a
great

the
hops
and

backbone
very
refreshing
good
carbonation

and
smooth

feel
with
a

this
pale

has
hop
bitterness
in
abundance
but
has
little
hop
flavor
perhaps
im
being
harsh
for
this
is
an
otherwise
very
good
pale
ale
the
head
retention
and
lacing
are
good
the
nose
is
attractive
the
palate
is
good
just
the
flavor
is
lacking
since
the
flavor
is
the
most
weighted
a
lower
final
score
occurs
nice
pale
ale
without
too
much
bitterness
definately
drinkable
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
tulip
this
is
a
local
brew
for
me
one
that
ive
come
back
to
often
as
an
after
work
beer
a
beautiful
ipa
clear
amber
body
soft
head
top
smells
of
grapefruit
very
hoppy
in
front
slight
malt
aftertaste
leaves
a
nice
citrus
hop
taste
overall
this
is
something
that
one
could
drink
over
and
over
as
i
have
taste
is
a
well
balanced
between
malt
and
grassy
hops
neither
is
overly
strong
to
overshadow
the
other
aspect
but
that
also
means
theres
no
shining
star
carbonation
is
decent
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
citrus
taste
is
hoppy
bitter
upfront
some
citrus
pine
as
well
smooth
and
enjoyable
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
final
word
this
one
feels
pretty
self
explanatory
to
me
given
how
few
descriptors
there
are
for
the
beer
as
even
the
hopbitterness
lovers
that
i
would
recommend
this
to
and
those
are
the
only
ones
i
would
recommend
it
to
should
still
want
something
with
more
depth
complexity
and
balance
than
this
beer
offers
the
vicious
carbonation
and
overwhelming
bitterness
make
for
a
brew
that
you
have
to
brace
yourself
against
before
every
sip
and
even
if
it
were
in
better
balance
there
are
so
few
flavors
present
in
the
beer
that
it
would
still
be
underwhelmingbland
my
hope
is
that
the
passing
of
time
could
benefit
this
beer
by
reining
in
the
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
creating
a
better
balance
as
it
stands
i
can
only
recommend
this
to
someone
craving
an
extremely
bitter
piney
tongue
bruiser
and
would
recommend
that
all
others
find
something
else
nothing
is
overpowering
in
this
beer
smells
good
but
faint
taste
is
there
but
subtle
great
example
of
the
style
the
taste
does
not
overpower
your
palette
some
breweries
confuse
the
american
pale
ale
and
the
india
victory
does
not
overall
a
good
beer
that
satisfies
during
a
hot
afternoon
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
and
a
really
exceptional
session
beer
this
has
been
one
of
my
go
to
session
beers
especially
in
the
summer
season
as
its
fairly
light
and
refreshing
and
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
while
being
very
solid
in
the
flavor
department
as
well
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
nice
representation
of
the
style
its
enjoyable
and
on
the
more
bitter
side
mouhfeel
pretty
decent
but
far
from
great
very
biscuity
which
reminds
me
a
lot
of
df
60
minute
in
that
regard
i
was
a
bit
let
down
with
this
one
however
its
still
very
refreshing
and
a
solid
offering
during
the
warm
months
really
like
this
style

know

this

is

this

from

i
love
the
sight
of
the
beer
and
the
smell
is
awesome
for
a
pale

light
malts
but
in
no
way
overwhelm
the
whole
of
the
beer
that
is
the

a

should
be

interesting
take
on
a
pale
ale
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
expected
i
was
able
to
have
this
as
a
nitro
handle
at
town
hall
in
cleveland
and
it
became
a
completely
different
animal
of
smoothness
i
wish
i
could
go
back
and
have
a
full
tasting
note
to
share
taste
starts
with
sweet
stale
crackers
then
floral
hops
moving
on
to
floury
bread
with
a

bready

me
how
good
it
tasted
one
of
my
new
favorite
ipas
if
youve
had
a
farmers
tan
by
southern
tier
its
similar
not
to
hoppy
of
an
ipa
and
it
goes
down
very
easy
im
just
getting
into
ipas
and
this
is
a
good
one
smooth
taste
and
mouthfeel
will
be
buying
this
again

overall
not

12
oz

pours
deep
golden
with
short
lived
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
citrusy
piney
hops
and
biscuit
malt
body
is
medium
and
crisp
herbal
piney
hops
dominate
the
flavor
while
pale
malt
provide
some
balance
finish
is
long
and
dry
ordinary
ale
calling
it
an
extraordinary
ale
may
be
an
overstatement
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
just
plain
good
a
very
good
beer
the
appearance
is
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
the
smell
was
full
of
hops
and
malt
the
taste
was
great
with
hints
of
citrus
taking
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
and
just
a
very
satisfying
brew
it
isnt
a
weird
or
terribly
complex
beer
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
incredibly
satisfying
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
looking
to
get
into
craft
beer
as
an
intro
into
how
much
better
beer
can
be
than
the
standards
a
decent
beer
overall
but
not
great
oa
very
nice
beer
that
i
could
see
buying
again
my
brother
like
this
as
well
so
i
will
likely
buy
this
again
o
not
the
most
focused
effort
the
hops
really
run
away
with
the
show
here
still
you
can
get
away
with
that
these
days
people
are
happy
with
onedimensional
hoppy
beers
and
it
stays
drinkable
enough
to
forgive
this
overall
i
thought
this
was
decent
beer
and
its
fairly
close
to
being
an
average
american
pale
ale
it
had
some
nice
balance
to
it
but
i
didnt
think
that
the
malts
and
the
hops
clashed
a
little
and
i
dont
think
they
blended
together
as
well
as
they
could
have
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
and
clean
but
the
taste
didnt
do
the
greatest
job
at
holding
my
attention
so
i
think
a
one
or
two
would
be
enough
for
me
since
it
doesnt
really
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
balance
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
nice
and
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
it
just
didnt
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
i
might
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
likes
pale
ales
that
arent
that
bitter
but
i
dont
think
that
it
will
really
stand
out
in
the
style
for
most
people
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
i
might
order
it
at
a
bar
if
i
saw
it
on
draft
all
in
all
i
didt
think
this
beer
was
that
great
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
either
it
was
kind
of
right
in
the
middle
and
it
didnt
really
have
anything
about
it
that
made
it
stand
out
better
luck
next
time
southern
tier
this
beer
just
wasnt
that
memorable
a
rather
run
of
the
mill
basic
pale
ale
but
drinkable
with
nothing
too
off
putting
othe
taste
seems
to
be
that
of
a
darker
beer
with
the
color
of
a
apa
o
its
not
bad
but
it
just
seems
to
miss
the
mark
it
was
aiming
for
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
biscuit
malt
citrus
notes
some
yeast
and
citrus
floral
hops
a
medium
crisp
body
on
the
palate
with
some
good
carbonation
finish
is
biscuit
malt
a
bit
of
grains
and
cereal
notes
with
some
citrus
flavor
and
floral
citrus
hops
balance
a
bit
more
lager
than
ale
overall
a
good
refreshing
o
i
remember
liking
this
beer
a
lot
more
when
i
first
had
it
several
years
ago
maybe
i
should
have
tried
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
for
my
review
appearance
is
good
a
golden
light
amber
color
smell
is
ok
not
very
strong
a
little
citrus
a
little
pine
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
that
taste
is
little
better
then
the
the
smell
you
get
the
same
things
with
a
litte
grapefruit
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
some
bready
taste
from
the
malts
mouthfeel
is
good
light
and
crisp
this
a
good
beer
for
today
since
ive
been
busting
my
in
the
yard
today
and
its
the
hottest
its
been
all
year
pours
clear
and
light
coppergold
with
a
fingers
worth
of
foam
that
fell
fast
but
left
a
skin
and
hung
around
on
the
sides

the
glass

with
constant
bubbles
rising

the
bottom

light

theres
even
a

plenty

clean

smooth
malt

dough
caramel

are
light
but
stay
with
the
nose
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
and
a
lingering
sweetness
semi
dry
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
thought
this
was
a
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
ale
and
while
it
wasnt
really
extraordinary
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
id
drink
it
again
if
none
of
the
other
options
were
new
or
interesting
o
i
really
like
this
beer
the
hops
and
malts
are
really
balanced
well
and
taste
wonderful

bready

biscuit
i
guess
with
a
nice

easy
drinker
but
a
bit
bitter
and
dry
finish
almost
tanic
its
a
solid
brew
just
not
my
fav
oextraordinary
maybe
not
but
i
could
see
this
as
a
staplelike
brew
with
the
likes
of
a
snpa
o
the
aroma
is
distinctly
similar
to
a
saison
more
of
an
english
hop
emphasis
with
solid
balance
little
sweet
in
the
taste
very
drinkable
good
brew
but
a
bit
out
of
apa
style
not
sure
whether
to
grade
it
well
for
uniqueness
or
poor
versus
typical
apas
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
dissipated
almost
immediately
this
offering
had
a
mildly
hoppy
and
floral
nose
the
flavor
is
relatively
thin
with
some
dry
hoppiness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
mediocre
pale
ale
that
is
certainly
not
bad
but
not
even
close
to
superb

easy

not
very

overall
a
sessionable
beer
but
also
a
bit
flavorless
founders
and
lagunitas
both
make
great
session
ipas
with
less
alcohol
but
tons
more
flavor
while
i
know
this
isnt
technically
a
session
beer
it
is
quite
refreshing
but
lacking
all
around
average
fingers
worth
of
just
offwhite
foam
full
mix
of
bubble
sizes
lots
of
dimpling
but
decent
retention
the
lacing
is
thin
but
spreads
into
broad
sheets
and
sticks
nicely
bright
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
touch
of
zinc
or
rust
to
deepen
it
crystal
clear
with
only
a
few
random
bubbles
visible
looks
kinda
adjuncty
the
nose
is
grainy
with
a
strong
pepper
component
also
offers
pizza
crusts
cornmeal
and
some
orange
to
lemon
citrus
to
sweeten
it
up
same
for
the
vague
apricot
peach
fruit
accents
becomes
leafier
and
greener
as
it
warms
mediumbodied
has
some
prickle
to
it
and
seemingly
intentional
bitter
bite
on
the
hoppy
side
for
an
apa
then
it
has
the
resinous
feel
without
the
pine
flavor
more
of
the
pepper
rye
to
pumpernickel
bread
mineral
water
and
with
larger
presence
of
savory
garden
herbs
than
flowers
the
tartness
suggests
a
space
reserved
for
grapefruit
citrus
and
more
tropical
like
pineapple
nectarine
papaya
fruit
but
the
chair
left
empty
its
overall
dryness
tends
to
distract
not
that
it
lacks
flow
but
you
start
getting
bitter
beer
face
o
nice
and
light
enough
flavor
to
let
you
know
its
their
but
still
easy
drinking
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
the
hop
profile
is
interesting
its
pretty
tough
to
pick
out
all
of
the
individual
aromas
and
flavors
its
very
different
than
any
other
apa
that
ive
had
and
unfortunately
not
in
a
great
way
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
something
about
the
aroma
and
flavor
just
seems
off
and
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
what
it
is
regardless
it
is
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
and
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
overall
this
is
a
cool
beer
i
could
see
sessioning
this
one
and
using
it
as
a
great
lawnmower
beer
very
nice
overall
one
of
the
weaker
offerings
from
southern
tier
o
average
pale
ale
nothing
stands
out
really
but
its
not
bad
overall
southern
tier
is
the
pride
of
ny
and
this
beer
is
nothing
less
than
id
expect
from
them
although
nowhere
near
their
best
offering
its
very
drinkable
with
above
average
flavor
theres
a
reason
why
this
company
is
successful
poured
from
12oz
bottle
clear
and
golden
witha
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
ring

smell

much
light
bready
malts
with
some
slight
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
clean
malts
with
just
a
twang
of
hop
flavor
to
finish
it
off
crisply
nothing
complex
here
but
a
tasty
and
drinkable
pale
o
the
body
was
spot
on
but
i
found
everything
kind
of
underwhelming
i
will
pass
in
the
future
overall
a
beer
i
always
enjoy

often

pale
golden
body
was
clear
and
the
head
was
a
two
finger
thick
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
slightly
vegetal
with
a
dash
of
piney
hops
the
taste
was
oddly
sour
which
was
followed
by
a
nondescript
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
body
felt
refreshing
and
light
with
the
tangy
sourness
helping
the
beer
go
down
easy
not
a
bad
beer
to
accompany
some
food
or
when
enjoying
a
game
with
a
friend
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
there
was
great
fruitiness
and
tartness
making
the
drinker
quite
excited
to
sample
we
felt
that
those
flavors
needed
to
pop
more
through
the
taste
what
flavor
was
there
was
warm
and
spicy
but
just
so
subdued
by
the
end
that
well
probably
reach
for
something
else
next
poured
light
golden
color
with
about
a
finger
of
suds
smelled
a
bit
malty
with
some
topical
fruits
and
pine
taste
was
light
with
nice
carbonation
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
hint
of
bitterness
flavor
of
pine
grapefruit
hop
finish
very
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
ale
very
bold
of
phin
matt
to
call
this
extraordinary
when
it
is
clearly
not
the
typical
would
not
seek
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
type
of
beer
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
body
with
not
head
just
a
thin
lace
around
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
slight
hop
aroma
and
some
malt
also
the
taste
has
a
nice
pine
flavor
from
the
hops
and
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
malt
come
in
to
play
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
goes
down
nice
overall
this
is
a
average
apa
but
very
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
extraordinary
either
regardless
of
the
name
i
tend
to
like
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
in
a
pale
ale
perhaps
my
bottle
was
a
bit
old
overall
they
totally
nailed
the
look
aroma
and
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
just
not
happening
though
theres
nothing
flawed
o
easy
to
drink
and
just
on
the
edge
of
being
sessionable
might
be
a
little
too
high
in
abv
and
too
intense
in
flavor
but
not
by
a
lot
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
a
moderately
hop
beer
with
enough
restraint
on
the
bitterness
to
make
for
a
very
approchable
and
refreshing
beer
hop
heads
wont
be
wowed
but
they
wont
be
disappointed
either
overall
it
has
a
good
balance
of
flavors
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
pale
ale
style
a
pleasant
non
offensive
beer
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
the
current
label
lists
this
at
5
7
abv
from
the
12
oz
bottle
overall
drinkable
but
with
all
of
the
high
end
flavorful
apas
out
there
this
one
hardly
stands
out
and
is
way
too
simplified
this
is
not
a
flavor
bomb
this
is
a
very
palatable
very
sessionable
ale
which
is
what
i
think
the
brewer
was
intending
to
do
here
very
nice
i
would
not
describe
this
beer
as
extraordinary
pleasant
though
overall
a
very
good
brew
and
i
might
consider
purchasing
it
over
the
gold
standard
of
american
pale
ales
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
i
wouldnt
go

a

the
abv
is
a
bit
high
to
really
pound
them
back
to
back
though
still
a
good
allaround
choice
and
a
generally
excellent
beer
good
work
southern
tier
are
you
kidding
me
my
expectations
way
exceeded
what
this
beer
delivered
started
ok
it
poured
a
1
5
white
head
with
average
fade
speed
the
body
though
clear
straw
yellow
was
at
least
darker
than
the
bmcs
smell
seemed
like
it
was
going
to
be
good
with
ipa
strength
hops
and
grapefruit
accents
but
the
taste
thats
where
it
fell
down
i
found
this
completely
unmatching
of
the
smell
rather
watery
and
it
has
a
strange
bitterness
to
it
which
i
wouldnt
liken
to
any
tasty
hop
ive
had
this
is
extraordinary
ale
really
i
genuinely
like
or
love
many
of
the
bold
flavor
bomb
beers
southern
tier
puts
out
but
i
just
dont
get
this
ale
folks
maybe
i
got
a
bad
sample
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
sampled
on
february
28
2012
the
pour
is
golden
yellow
to
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
that
fizzles
fast
good
clarity
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malts
and
floral
hops
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
creamy
character
the
taste
leans
more
toward
the
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
toasted
hops
are
in
the
flavor
but
it
starts
out
slightly
malty
and
ends
almost
dry
it
is
not
as
exciting
as
the
way
it
is
billed
on
the
label
clear
golden
color
smallish
white
head
that
leaves
a
light
covering
on
top
after
a
slow
fade
bits
of
lace
here
and
there
smell
has
a
healthy
amount
of
malt
and
carmel
sweetness
hops
are
citrusy
and
in
good
measure
taste
has
an
american
tilt
toward
hops
in
the
front
with
a
nice
balancing
amount
of
malt
and
breadiness
to
keep
it
in
check
a
bit
yeasty
fruitiness
that
hangs
in
the
finish
which
is
clean
dry
and
nicely
hopped
feel
is
crisp
and
lightly
tingly
with
a
nice
medium
light
weight
a
good
sessionable
easy
drinking
pale
ale
that
will
go
well
with
many
good
foods
and
good
times
onot
that
anything
should
ever
be
judged
just
on
name
but
this
really
doesnt
qualify
as
it
is
billed
lightish
body
with
a
medium
effervescence
somewhat
watery
throughout
this
could
be
a
good
deal
better
o
nice
beer
this
would
be
a
great
craft
beer
to
introduce
noncraft
drinkers
nice
and
easy
drinking
nothing
to
over
the
top
highly
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
overall
i
found
this
to
be
extraordinarily
average
not
bad
its
no
sn
pale
ale
but
its
satisfying
and
meets
the
standard
pours
a
deep
golden
yelloworange
with

carbonation
faint

the
nose
with
a
lemon
musk
wafting
around
the
low
profile
hops
and
funky
must
give
it
almost
like
a
lager
type
smell
that
i
cant
seem
to
get
over
a
citrus
tingle
on
the
tongue
light
malts
light

character
more
of
that
grainy
lager
style
on
the
taste
slight
lemon
bitter
on
the

light
in
body
and
in
the
mouth
big
carbonation
southern
tier
makes
some
extraordinary
ales
this
aint
one
of
em
i
just
dont
get
this
beer
at
all
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
person
just
weaning
off
of
bmc
or
drinks
it
regularly
to
try
because
they
have
similar
characteristics
man
it
hurts
slamming
a
st
beer
but
this
beer
sucks
do
your
self
a
favor
and
avoid
it
overall
average
at
best
certainly
not
extraordinary
by
any
means
maybe
pedestrian
or
working
mans
ale
might
be
a
more
appropriate
my
scores
are
kind
and
definitely
give
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
the
label
lists
this
as
5
7
abv
as
i
said
this
beer
is
not
very
complex
but
i
dont
think
it
needs
to
be
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
good
flavor
this
could
easily
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
very
drinkable
though
poured
into
new
belgium
snifter
soft
white
lacing
with
some
nice
wheaty
peach
color
nose
is
a
touch
muted
but
opens
up
with
some
nice
spearmint
and
orange
marmalade
and
same
on
mouthfeel
with
some
rather
muted
citrusy
hops
not
overly
hoppy
but
pleasant
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
decent
apa
but
its
hardly
complex
the
flavor
profile
is
all
around
subdued
i
prefer
st
beers
that
are
more
robust
and
showcase
a
more
profound
flavor
profile
for
the
style
however
it

the

it

is
something
that
i
would

to
have
on
a
sunny

taste
is
refreshingly
crisp
notes
of
citrus
are
what
really
pops
out
at
me
comes
off
as
a
touch
on
the
dry
side
which
i
like
a
lot
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
for
sure
decent
pale
ale
from
st
note
live
review
the
rams
head
in
west
chester
penna
taste
bitter
grapefruit
giving
way
to
sweet
orange
with
some
spicy
coriander
notes
followed
by
a
biscuity
chewy
malt
mouthfeel
very
nice
a
solid
ale
overall
not
as
impressed
with
this
one
advertised
as
having
3
types
of
malts
3
types
of
hops
i
was
pretty
excited
color
is
clear
yellow
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
nice
sweet
apricot
and
grains
coming
out
the
taste
was
bready
earthy
and
bitter
in
a
somewhat
stale
and
off
putting
way
i
almost
didnt
review
this
because
i
thought
the
bottle
may
have
gone
bad
but
other
reviews
seem
to
suggest
thats
how
it
is
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
is
nice
a
good
american
pale
ale
i
have
had
better
and
i
have
had
worse
a
good
beer
for
a
drinking
session
but
it
may
get
boring
after
a
while
ive
been
liking
the
southern
tier
products
lately
so
i
picked
a
single
up
from
wegmans
mixed
six
area
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
clear
and
golden
with
a
minimal
head
whats
going
in
here
slight
hop
aroma
mixed
with
malt
this
is
kind
of
weird
tasted
kind
of
basic
kind
of
like
a
junior
apa
not
sure
why
this
is
extraordinary
basically
ok
not
sure
what
a
solid
club
like
southern
tier
was
after
with
this
one
it
is
not
extraordinary
by
any
stretch
its
easy
to
drink
and
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
it
just
seems
like
a
lost
puppy
with
no
pedigree
good
brew
tasty
and
refreshing
overall
a
light
refreshing
brew
easy
drinking
but
not
as
great
as
some
good
pale
ales
dont
see
ever
re
buying
this
one
not
bad
just
not
good
enough
alot
of
hop
flavor
with
only
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
malt
backbone
is
pretty
flabby
but
i
think
the
brewers
intended
this
to
be
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
biscuit
dominates
with
a
grainy
very
mild
toffee
character
i
like
the
hops
used
here
little
bit
of
tropical
lot
of
citrus
and
a
smattering
of
resin
freshness
seems
to
be
paramount
to
this
one
as
i
already
notice
a
difference
in
the
3
weeks
it
has
been
since
i
last
cracked
one
of
these
pretty
tasty
stuff
overall
i
could
see
myself
getting
a
sixer
of
this
at
least
once
a
year
or
so
o
pretty
good
apa
but
not
extraordinary
o
solid
wellbalanced
an
easydrinking
apa
o
a
pretty
decent
pale
not
the
best
by
far
but
very
drinkable
i
like
it
this
would
enter
the
regular
rotation
at
my
house
if
it
werent
so
pricey
10
a
six
pack
oupon
review
the
ipa
is
better
but
i
also
remember
thinking
the
ipa
in
the
mix
was
a
little
off
however
it
is
still
solid
not
the
best
apa
but
a
cheaper
and
easy
to
get
session
beer
o
very
easy
drinker
good
for
a
few
not
an
extrordinary
beer
but
well
worth
a
visit
extraordinary
ale
a
bit
short
of
the
mark
but
does
qualify
for
at
least
good
nice
depth
of
hopping
with
some
tealike
notes
malt
is
likewise
nicely
layered
and
balanced
hops
bittering
is
less
than
one
would
expect
for
an
apa
and
seems
more
in
line
with
that
of
a
pale
ale
nice
session
candidate
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
head
toasty
aroma
malty
with
mild
hints
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
taste
of
toasty
grains
and
malts
moderately
sweet
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
gently
infused
a
bit
metallic
medium
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
but
pretty
standard
aka
not
that
extraordinary
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
making
for
a
refreshing
apa
one
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
overall
not
my
favorite
apa
but
id
have
it
again
if
offered
o
phin
matts
extraordinary
ale
not
so
much
this
isnt
even
ordinary
let
alone
extraordinary
this
is
about
the
weakest
apa
ive
ever
had
out
of
a
microbrewery
on
the
bright
side
at
least
its
not
offensive
at
all
its
basically
seltzer
water
that
someone
dropped
a
slice
of
toast
in
so
far
southern
tier
is
0
for
2
on
their
regular
abv
lineup
love
their
big
beers
though
overall
not
enough
body
or
hop
for
this
one
very
refreshing
but
just
doesnt
suite
the
style
such
a
shame
since
im
such
a
huge
fan
of
southern
tier
also
have
had
this
one
in
bottle
and
remember
it
much
differently
o
a
decent
session
pale
ale
it
feels
good
it
smells
good
i
just
wish
the
taste
were
a
little
more
refined
its
certainly
good
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
wholly
balanced
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
poured
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
to
find
golden
straw
colored
body
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
had
a
lot
of
malts
with
a
few
hints
of
grapefruit
hops
and
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
was
good
though
i
did
feel
like
it
was
missing
something
i
didnt
think
that
the
taste
held
up
with
the
aroma
it
was
a
good
tasting
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
it
was
a
light
and
crisp
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
just
wish
that
the
flavors
would
have
stood
out
a
bit
more
phin
matts
extraordinary
ale
is
an
american
pale
ale
pours
out
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
just
a
ever
so
slight
haze
to
it
small
white
head
which
disappears
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
scent
has
a
light
candy
sweetness
along
with
just
a
touch
of
piney
hops
as
for
the
taste
its
got
a
candy
sweetness
much
lighter
malts
than
many
pas
youll
see
not
even
getting
any
caramel
out
of
this
touch
of
flowerypiney
hops
some
toasted
breadiness
medium
to
light
bodied
nice
wet
feel
an
easygoing
ale
a
nice
session
style
very
tasty
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
list
its
style
im
really
impressed
overall
phin
matts
is
a
good
ale
but
tends
to
lose
flavor
as
the
sugars
get
dominated
by
bitterness
if
the
entire
bottle
tasted
like
the
first
mouthful
this
one
would
be
gold
overall
i
like
it
better
than
the
regular
pale
ale
theres
more
flavor
d
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
but
i
guess
its
worth
its
price
tag
phin
matts
extraordinary
ale
poured
a
strawy
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
but
alot
of
bubbles
from
crabonatin
the
smell
was
rather
malty
and
earthy
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
something
hoppeir
the
taste
was
very
malty
but
the
hops
arent
noticable
ruins
anything
sweet
from
the
malts
theres
almost
a
harshness
the
taste
does
stay
on
the
paletee
and
thats
almost
unforntante
its
harsh
a
random
bittners
comes
but
you
dont
get
to
enjoy
a
floral
hoppy
flavor
overall
i
wish
i
could
say
some
better
things
i
didnt
like
this
one
i
would
avoid
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
little
carbonation
kick
the
taste
has
some
notes
of
citrus
in
the
way
of
lemon
and
a
little
hop
kick
that
brings
a
crispness
to
that
smoothness
the
hop
kick
is
a
little
too
brief
and
doesnt
linger
very
long
leaving
one
sort
of
wanting
a
little
more
strength
out
of
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
malt
presence
leading
to
a
bland
taste
in
the
end
truly
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
blandness
of
the
flavors
is
definitely
underwhelming
an
eh
kind
of
a
beer
but
its
drinkability
is
a
plus
and
therefore
still
worth
the
try
d
entirely
drinkable
totally
a
summer
gulper
would
compliment
a
salad
or
a
burger
even
totally
worth
the
purchase
and
much
easier
to
drink
than
dales
pale
but
would
file
under
the
same
category
good
mouthfeel
overall
i
think
this
is
super
quaffable
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
i
am
loving
the
pale
ale
style
and
these
guys
definitely
have
it
right
on
i
will
seek
out
more
of
their
beers
for
sure
d
nicely
balanced
interesting
but
not
complicated
nicely
drinkable
solid
malt
base
really
lets
interesting
hop
profile
shine
not
distinctly
american
west
coast
c
hops
not
really
english
not
really
noble
a
nice
select
blend
good
for
a
session
certainly
better
than
their
pale
though
perhaps
not
truly
extraordinary
careful
with
those
superlatives
d
very
drinkable
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
at
the
same
time
a
bit
empty
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
mixed
in
there
body
lays
a
bit
flat
with
the
carbonation
and
sits
just
under
a
medium
mouthfeel
starts
a
bit
empty
and
picks
up
a
general
steam
of
pick
me
up
as
it
goes
pretty
much
the
younger
brother
beer
of
gemini
the
only
other
brew
from
southern
tier
i
steer
away
from
as
pales
goes
this
stuff
is
a
little
above
average
but
not
by
much
oshit
the
bottle
had
me
excited
three
different
malts
thre
different
hops
probably
not
that
much
different
from
other
pas
but
it
is
good
marketing
the
product
is
not
very
good
though
the
regular
st
pale
ale
kicks
the
shit
out
of
this
that
is
a
decent
beer
this
is
not
stop
brewing
this
would
be
my
suggestion
i
believe
this
bottle
may
not
be
as
fresh
as
id
like
so
when
i
find
a
fresher
batch
ill
edit
my
review
accordingly
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
overall
is
just
to
bland
for
me
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
just
kinda
bland
its
simple
and
decent
but
certainly
far
from
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
had
recently
just
a
pleasant
all
around
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
nothing
wrong
with
having
a
few
of
these
in
the
fridge
for
when
freinds
come
over
its
similar
to
the
first
citra
beer
i
fell
in
love
with
its
not
ordinary
but
its
not
really
extraordinary
id
say
its
somewhere
in
the
middle
well
call
it
extraord
or
traordinary
had
at
bobbique
pours
a
bright
amber
some
decent
lacing
head
did
not
last
smell
was
floral
earthy
not
hoppy
rather
like
an
esb
than
a
pale
ale
tasted
more
like
an
apa
balanced
bitter
and
only
a
bit
hoppy
maybe
more
hops
would
have
made
this
better
mouthfeel
was
tacky
liked
it
overall
decent
brew
from
southern
tier
st
is
proving
that
they
can
brew
more
than
just
dessert
stouts
this
certainly
is
a
pretty
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
albeit
strange
for
style
decent
example
of
the
apa
style
could
use
more
american
hop
character
and
bitterness
to
improve
tasty
malt
backbone
and
a
great
dry
finish
its
alright
drinkable
bitter
through
and
through
o
a
great
extra
in
a
great
trade
super
glad
i
go
to
try
this
one
thank
you
lerxst
overall
it
was
an
average
example
of
a
pale
ale
there
was
very
little
extraordinary
about
it
im
sorry
matt
and
phinn
pleasant
mouthfeel
with
nice
carb
i
like
it
i
could
drink
this
and
be
quite
pleased
but
theres
nothing
here
that
would
make
me
buy
it
again
overall
my
only
gripe
is
maybe
it
could
use
a
touch
more
hops
would
like
to
try
it
again
but
i
liked
the
pale
better
finally
pulled
the
trigger
on
a
single
o
this
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
caramel
musty
flowers
and
light
pine
the
taste
holds
notes
of
even
milder
caramel
orange
peel
light
grapefruit
rind
and
light
grass
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
seems
to
want
to
be
dry
overall
i
was
severely
underwhelmed
by
this
brew
i
cant
say
its
necessarily
bad
in
any
real
respect
but
it
doesnt
come
anywhere
near
something
i
can
call
good
the
name
brings
about
flashbacks
of
bill
and
teds
excellent
adventure
though
im
sure
thats
just
a
coincidence
pours
a
dead
clear
golden
amber
with
virtually
no
head
smells
of
hops
still
hanging
on
the
vine
and
taste
like
it
too
first
sip
is
instant
hops
however
there
is
no
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
as
with
other
hoppy
brews
as
the
hops
roll
off
there
are
definite
notes
of
caramel
and
malts
this
is
perfect
for
the
person
looking
to
ease
into
the
flavor
of
hops
or
is
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
many
of
these
and
not
get
bored
with
the
instant
hop
hit
extraordinary
maybe
not
but
it
is
refreshing
and
damn
delicious
none
the
less
overall
not
bad
at
all
here
this
was
a
very
good
little
session
ale
that
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
out
again
some
day
i
would
love
to
find
it
on
cask
to
give
it
a
good
whirl
definitly
worth
another
look
here
poured
from
the
bottle
a
amber
orange
clear
color
with
a
bright
white
loose
head
smell
is
soft
citrus
and
hints
of
some
buscuit
and
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
is
simply
complex
not
overpowering
in
hops
or
malt
but
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
ranges
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
to
bits
of
buscuit
and
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
good
body
and
carbonation
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
not
outstanding
but
balanced
and
good
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
gigantic
amount
of
head
on
it
it
was
pretty
much
the
entire
glass
was
foam
and
with
the
smallest
amount
of
liquid
at
the
bottom
it
took
several
tries
to
get
the
entire
beer
into
the
glass
once
it
settled
this
beer
was
a
clear
yellow
color
the
aroma
was
on
the
hoppy
side
not
too
much
else
really
happening
there
the
taste
was
a
little
piney
the
after
taste
had
some
malts
kicking
in
but
not
a
whole
lot
the
mouthfeel
was
ridiculously
carbonated
every
sip
i
took
the
beer
just
went
crazy
and
foamed
up
in
my
mouth
it
was
kind
of
a
pain
because
it
was
hard
to
get
a
decent
mouthful
overall
easy
breezy
session
beer
overall
a
pretty
flavorful
pale
ale
looks
good
and
drinks
good
i
like
this
beer
actually
one
of
the
best
pales
ive
had
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malts
ones
like
or
dislike
of
this
offering
will
hinge
entirely
on
acceptance
of
a
sugary
jasmineflavored
ale
i
found
it
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
on
occasion
others
may
downright
hate
it
overall
im
fairly
surprised
at
the
reviews
here
this
is
an
extremely
simple
but
tasty
beer
overall
the
taste
is
pretty
basic
but
it
isnt
a
bad
brew
it
is
more
balanced
than
southtiers
pale
ale
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
all
in
all
very
drinkable
and
simple
brew
just
nothing
extraoridinary
d
i
rated
this
high
its
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
drinks
well
really
well
this
is
a
session
beer
and
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
is
pretty
good
if
your
looking
for
something
lighter
to
drink
but
there
are
still
better
choices
out
there
for
sure
o
i
wouldnt
really
classify
this
beer
as
extraordinary
as
the
labels
says
its
an
okay
beer
overall
wellbalanced
but
lacking
a
lot
flavor
id
classify
this
as
an
adequate
drinkable
session
beer
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
highly
recommended
by
the
bartender
at
one
of
our
local
watering
holes
i
generally
trust
his
recommendations
im
a
huge
pa
and
ipa
fan
this
beer
tasted
like
the
beers
was
strained
through
a
grass
catching
bag
from
a
lawn
mower
poured
attractive
as
typical
pale
but
as
soon
as
the
beer
hits
the
inside
of
the
mouth
the
bitterness
is
more
biting
than
appealing
and
therefore
brings
most
catagories
into
the
not
impressed
range
for
me
on
this
beer
the
finish
is
a
finish
a
long
to
forget
it
has
a
below
average
mouthfeel
boring
too
watery
and
macrobrewish
its
not
hard
to
drink
and
not
terrible
by
any
stretch
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
either
d
crisp
and
refreshing
id
probably
prefer
it
colder
and
drink
it
as
a
lawnmower
beer
not
bad
for
the
money
but
not
great
either
its
a
good
solid
nothing
fancy
apa
tm
again
the
citrus
and
piney
hops
balance
well
with
the
moderate
malt
profile
lighter
bodied
for
the
style
cut
nicely
with
a
higher
carbonation
level
finishes
clean
this
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruit
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
has
some
grapefruit
and
a
little
bitterness
there
isnt
much
else
there
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
little
high
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
good
either
i
wouldnt
complain
about
drinking
this
again
but
if
given
other
options
i
probably
wouldnt
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
little
to
no
lacing
smells
malty
and
a
bit
toasty
also
a
little
orange
rind
and
coriander
palate
is
malty
earthy
and
citrusy
hops
add
grapefruit
and
some
orange
flavor
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
fluid
with
mild
dryness
drinkable
but
not
memorable
their
regular
pale
ale
is
much
better
than
this
so
i
have
to
wonder
whats
the
point
poured
a
deep
yellow
with
a
hint
of
orange
excellent
clarity
nice
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
wet
lacings
and
a
thin
white
cap
medium
bodied
with
tangy
carbonation
lemony
citrus
and
bready
aromas
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
lemony
citrus
hop
flavor
and
bready
grainy
malt
flavors
a
bit
of
a
stale
bread
finish
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
about
a
finger
of
snow
cap
white
head
that
retains
fair
enough
and
gives
off
sparse
soapy
lace
slight
hoppy
aroma
and
bit
of
fruitiness
to
it
i
guess
i
would
call
it
strawberry
oddly
enough
i
also
kind
of
smell
sharp
cheddar
cheese
faintly
grainy
flavors
with
a
slight
fruity
profile
and
again
a
weird
cheesy
flavor
this
just
seems
a
bit
off
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
fair
kind
of
under
carbonated
in
my
opinion
but
it
drinks
alright
certainly
not
my
favorite
though
d
highly
drinkable
the
beer
was
a
lighter
medium
feel
to
it
with
good
carbonation
the
beer
was
very
smooth
crisp
and
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
and
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
those
styles
that
i
think
is
very
underrated
this
is
a
quality
apa
and
one
that
should
be
enjoyed
often
much
better
apas
out
there
i
finished
it
quickly
to
get
something
more
flavorful
to
drink
dvery
drinkable
crisp
at
tasty
all
the
way
through
i
could
have
many
of
these
in
a
night
there
arent
any
real
negative
qualities
that
keep
me
from
wanting
to
have
this
again
in
fact
this
wasnt
my
first
bottle
poured
a
nice
crisp
yellow
into
a
red
plastic
cup
beggars
cant
be
choosers
with
a
thin
frothy
head
that
could
be
reawoken
with
a
swirl
smelled
of
syrupy
thick
hops
taste
followed
the
nose
a
bit
but
more
malty
but
definitely
rich
and
a
bit
syrupy
pretty
drinkable
but
a
bit
thicker
than
i
usually
aim
for
the
hops
malt
balance
doesnt
really
make
it
heavy
in
any
direction
seems
like
a
safety
type
of
brew
nithing
outstanding
but
nothing
offensive
this
actually
drinks
pretty
well
id
certainly
buy
it
again
would
be
great
in
cans
for
fishin
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
no
head
or
lingering
lace
its
aroma
is
mainly
grapefruit
with
hints
of
citrus
and
caramel
the
flavor
begins
with
grapefruit
followed
by
a
good
balance
between
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
average
phin
matts
extraordinary
ale
is
a
decent
beer
recommended
i
really
wish
they
would
can
this
beer
and
make
more
of
the
stuff
that
actually
tastes
good
this
tastes
like
a
mainstream
ale
that
should
appeal
to
the
masses
but
in
the
end
doesnt
impress
nice
hop
aroma
but
the
taste
is
flat
no
real
hops
no
real
malt
flavor
too
many
good
beers
from
st
to
drink
this
one
12oz
bottle
pours
a
translucent
light
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
with
some
grains
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
taste
is
a
bit
more
malt
than
i
expected
has
a
slight
bitter
hop
taste
too
earthy
flavors
as
well
certainly
a
drinkable
apa
works
fine
in
a
mix
12
pack
but
not
worth
seeking
out
on
its
own
overall
i
was
very
unimpressed
with
this
beer
it
was
just
not
pleasurable
to
drink
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
else
and
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
nothing
in
this
beer
really
stood
out
for
me
this
beer
is
exactly
extraordinary
but
has
good
drinkability
d
i
rated
this
high
its
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
drinks
well
really
well
this
is
a
session
beer
and
goes
down
pretty
easily
drink
an
average
beer
that
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
it
wasnt
awful
it
was
just
nothing
special
mediumdeep
orange
color
some

very

for
such

would
make
for
a
light

summer
beer
malt
shows
through
more
as
beer
warms
taste
not
very
complex
not
to
have
three
hop
varieties
and
three
malts
simple
and
relatively
clean
drinkability
this
isnt
one
id
seek
out
but
would
be
perfectly
acceptably
if
somebody
handed
me
a
couple
three
bottles
taste
like
the
aroma
seemed
to
be
largely
devoid
of
hops
with
a
name
like
extraordinary
i
found
this
to
be
extremely
pedestrian
and
average
all
around
light
hops
light
light
light
everything
tasted
like
a
good
light
beer
which
is
pretty
much
unacceptable
for
an
apa
much
less
one
made
by
the
awesome
st
pretty
bland
i
can
get
bland
without
spending
this
much
for
it
d
nothing
mindblowing
but
solid
overall
i
like
the
pale
malt
profile
in
this
one
nice
drinkability
to
it
could
throw
these
back
like
easy
drinking
session
beers
d
pretty
average
i
would
not
consider
it
extraordinary
at
all
d
drinkable
not
outstanding
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
its
drinkable
you
could
probably
put
a
few
of
these
down
and
its
cheap
too
overall
not
a
terribly
impressive
brew
and
i
probably
wont
return
to
it
db
a
decent
pale
ale
but
i
dont
think
the
floral
forward
apa
works
for
me
the
malt
balances
it
somewhat
but
it
feels
unbalanced
light
and
refreshing
but
not
extraordinary
in
the
least
this
isnt
a
southern
tier
for
the
extreme
brew
lovers
this
shows
a
lighter
side
of
southern
tier
that
buyers
of
their
imperial
bombers
might
not
even
see
its
awesome
that
theyre
good
at
both
sides
of
the
spectrum
highly
recommended
to
those
who
dont
always
want
their
beers
to
be
extreme
a
fine
example
of
the
style
though
not
particularly
memorable
the
label
boasts
3
varieties
of
hops
and
3
types
of
malts
nothing
that
amounts
to
a
deeply
complex
beer
but
extraordinary
in
its
execution
overall
im
disappointed
ive
fallen
in
love
with
southern
tiers
imperial
beers
and
maybe
im
spoiled
as
a
result
but
this
doesnt
live
up
d
drinkable
yes
southern
tier
worthy
no
nice
transition
beer
from
something
along
the
lines
of
a
bud
light
but
not
worthy
of
a
true
apa
deasy
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
offers
more
taste
than
bmc
here
ya
go
also
seek
out
this
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
being
disappointed
o
disappointing
selection
from
a
brewery
that
normally
impresses
me
d
high
this
to
me
is
a
great
summer
beer
light
enough
to
have
a
few
and
enjoy
drinkability
nice
balanced
apa
my
5th
southern
tier
since
loading
up
on
their
brews
just
new
to
colmbus
ga
great
lineup
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
character
i
normally
find
desireable
in
a
pale
ale
however
while
i
dont
think
ill
be
partaking
in
this
brew
again
i
do
recommend
it
be
sampled
by
other
beer
fans
so
they
too
can
offer
their
opinions
drinks
average
almost
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
in
the
flavor
profile
and
body
but
not
a
terribly
good
one
nothing
terrible
about
this
beer
but
one
that
ill
pass
up
in
the
future
unless
its
my
only
option
in
which
case
ill
drink
it
the
body
is
firm
and
actually
quite
filling
for
this
style
good
carbonation
per
the
reviews
i
wasnt
expecting
much
going
into
this
one
but
this
is
a
pleasant
pa
mild
bready
flavor
that
is
touched
up
by
a
kiss
of
honey
sweetness
finishes
with
a
smack
of
american
hops
i
like
this
beer
this
would
be
a
regular
sessioner
were
it
available
here
clear
solid
yellow
brew
generates
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
foam
that
settles
to
a
thin
dense
layer
smell
is
semisweet
malts
and
lemongrass
swirl
of
the
glass
gives
a
shortlived
flare
up
of
watery
foam
that
runs
straight
down
the
glass
instead
of
hanging
on
as
lace
at
all
taste
is
pretty
earthy
yeast
light
citrus
and
some
other
mixed
hop
d
while
not
my
favorite
beer
by
a
long
shot
its
got
a
nice
flavor
if
i
was
looking
for
an
inoffensive
summer
ale
worth
checking
out
mildly
rich
body
carbonation
could
be
higher
to
cut
through
that
massively
malty
sweetness
pretty
good
i
liked
it
it
was
a
little
bit
different
than
the
usual
apa
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
you
do
get
a
sense
of
malt
as
well
as
hops
with
neither
one
overpowering
the
other
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
southern
tier
in
this
one
but
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
extraordinary
as
the
title
claims
d
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
flavor
overall
meh
trite
story
and
a
beer
to
match
thats
really
surprising
from
southern
tier
served
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
settled
down
and
no
lace
color
is
a
copper
amber
aroma
is
malt
caramel
a
little
honey
spice
and
hop
flavor
has
a
little
more
sweetness
coming
out
along
with
a
little
hop
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
kind
of
short
a
yawner
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
one
finger
of
eggshell
head
it
is
a
deep
golden
color
the
aroma
is
yeast
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
is
yeast
caramel
and
almost
imperceptible
hops
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
balanced
apa
this
not
an
immpressive
attempt
from
a
company
that
makes
some
tremendous
beer
tastemelon
biscuit
subtle
hop
bite
creamy
nicely
balanced
nothing
overthetop
here
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
wellbalanced
pale
ale
overall
this
is
one
amazing
stock
brews
for
being
an
ipa
fan
and
not
usually
caring
for
apas
i
thought
this
brew
was
pretty
good
really
clean
a
good
one
to
have
on
hand
for
the
hop
or
malt
lovers
really
good
for
people
getting
into
the
realm
of
craft
brews
had
this
one
several
times
the
first
time
ive
had
it
i
absolutely
loved
it
however
ive
had
it
a
couple
of
other
times
since
and
havent
been
as
impressed
to
only
be
fare
i
waited
to
review
this
when
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
pale
ale
poured
this
one
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
away
about
half
way
through
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
to
it
the
smell
is
good
mainly
citrus
hops
with
some
floral
and
herbal
aromas
as
well
some
slight
pale
malts
the
taste
is
on
par
with
the
smell
some
toasted
pale
malts
i
really
like
the
taste
too
caramel
and
toasted
pale
malts
citrus
hops
dominate
the
rest
of
the
flavor
its
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
lighter
in
body
and
a
good
carbonation
feel
a
little
complex
because
it
feels
prett
clean
but
as
it
warms
a
bit
there
is
almost
a
buttery
tone
to
it
which
makes
it
seem
like
a
more
hopped
english
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
could
easily
be
had
year
round
a
solid
welldone
brew
balanced
brew
if
they
were
a
bit
cheaper
and
more
excessable
in
my
area
could
easily
be
a
stand
by
i
drank
this
one
with
pleasure
overall
great
summer
beer
but
balanced
enough
to
carry
itself
into
midlate
fall
its
assertive
and
flavorful
but
not
too
much
d
a
really
solid
american
pale
ale
a
little
more
in
the
flavor
profile
would
make
this
a
terrific
offering
but
unfortunately
it
falls
a
tad
short
however
this
one
delivers
in
all
other
facets
and
i
would
gladly
drink
again
quite
quaffable
and
sessionable
this
beer
seemed
like
it
didnt
know
what
it
wanted
to
be
if
you
like
pale
ale
from
sierra
nevada
three
floyds
or
bells
dont
bother
buying
this
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
i
just
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
extraordinary
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
with
chunky
lacing
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
greets
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
background
the
malt
has
a
toasted
caramel
aroma
the
front
comes
in
with
decent
amount
of
malt
character
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
from
the
aroma
the
middle
is
prickly
with
carbonation
before
going
out
with
some
slightly
harsh
bitterness
the
finish
is
lingering
body
is
pretty
creamy
and
drinkability
is
ok
a
decent
beer
ok
pale
ale
reminds
me
more
of
a
cream
ale
refreshing
and
nice
for
the
summertime
d
very
drinkable
ill
probably
buy
a
sixer
soon
value
pricey
i
paid
8
99
for
a
sixer
im
no
cheapskate
but
i
think
this
beer
would
be
more
fairly
priced
at
around
6
99
per
sixer
maybe
it
is
up
in
new
york
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
bit
of
orange
shining
through
with
a
bright
white
thick
head
that
laces
through
completion
aroma
is
faint
hints
of
citrus
and
bread
a
lot
of
breadiness
and
a
toasty
flavor
to
start
semisweet
malt
a
little
citrus
hops
are
next
before
a
subtle
caramel
malt
and
the
slightest
hints
of
dark
fruit
finishes
with
some
pinegrassy
hops
overall
overall
the
beer
was
a
decent
light
citrusy
ale
not
really
my
style
but
i
thought
it
was
decent
i
much
prefer
their
creme
brulee
a
or
porter
a
d
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
extraordinary
its
not
something
ill
actively
seek
out
again
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
with
some
light
lacing
smells
somewhat
waxy
and
grainy
with
a
meaty
backbone
of
herbal
hops
that
same
grainy
waxiness
is
in
the
taste
along
with
enough
malt
to
balance
in
fact
the
malt
tastes
oddly
like
a
malted
shake
but
without
the
sweetness
and
the
effect
is
that
the
beer
tastes
more
dry
than
sweet
not
bad
actually
stiff
and
a
bit
too
thick
in
the
mouth
for
a
pale
ale
but
i
found
this
decent
enough
for
my
tastes
d
good
drinkability
because
of
the
light
body
and
complex
taste
d
this
is
challenging
alpha
king
for
my
fav
session
beer
extremely
drinkable
at
least
on
tap
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
d
definitely
would
be
a
good
session
beer
because
it
is
smooth
and
easydrinking
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
and
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
it
goes
down
well
and
would
pair
well
with
a
few
different
food
choices
really
good
drinkability
really
easy
drinking
nice
for
the
summer
months
on
the
beach
and
what
notas
i
just
finished
a
sixer
of
these
the
other
day
on
the
beach
and
it
couldnt
have
been
more
of
a
perfect
beer
i
would
recommend
this
but
sts
pale
is
a
much
better
pale
ale
phin
and
matts
is
more
towards
the
malty
side
whereas
pale
is
more
hoppy
theres
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
ale
my
second
southern
tier
and
im
not
seeing
what
everyone
is
raving
about
sorry
this
ale
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
nicely
malty
although
not
too
strong
rich
malty
flavor
has
an
undertone
of
spices
mainly
cloves
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
texture
is
pleasingly
smooth
and
somewhat
lively
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
sweet
malt
aroma
lemoncitrus
flowers
i
thought
the
malt
came
through
more
in
the
taste
tasting
like
a
brioche
with
a
little
lemon
and
some
late
hops
pretty
balanced
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
i
found
it
to
be
well
balanced
in
all
regards
there
wasnt
scads
of
malt
sweetness
and
there
wasnt
a
splurge
of
harsh
unnecessary
bitterness
its
just
a
straightup
good
apa
the
flavor
is
mild
traditional
malt
taste
with
a
tasteful
amount
of
hops
that
makes
me
think
of
a
sn
glissade
a
little
bit
the
hops
are
bitter
and
flowery
and
balanced
to
the
malt
well
over
all
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
warmer
weather
and
a
welcome
subtlety
and
balanced
come
with
it
although
compared
to
other
apas
this
one
is
kind
of
lacking
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
i
expect
that
it
is
designed
to
be
much
better
but
without
a
date
on
the
bottle
i
have
to
take
it
at
face
value
the
hop
character
they
claim
to
have
is
missing
and
all
i
get
is
a
malt
bomb
without
the
bomb
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
a
moderately
coarse
texture
i
enjoy
that
in
a
apaipa
thumbs
up
d
i
found
myself
sipping
this
and
im
not
quite
sure
why
it
was
very
yummy
and
if
i
had
started
my
night
off
with
this
i
could
see
having
a
few
decent
brew
with
easy
drinkability
overall
i
am
simply
whelmed
by
this
beer
with
no
real
feelings
one
way
or
another
i
also
found
that
the
tap
version
was
slightly
hoppier
than
the
bottle
i
had
but
not
by
much
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
pretty
boring
beer
in
my
opinion
definitely
an
upgrade
to
budweiser
categories
but
not
an
exciting
craft
brew
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
phin
and
matts
is
an
extremely
well
prepared
brew
the
clarity
is
perfect
the
head
though
not
exceedingly
robust
is
consistent
the
taste
is
good
at
all
temperatures
and
you
really
could
drink
a
whole
mess
of
these
d
this
is
overall
an
average
beer
and
is
easy
to
drink
it
is
worth
getting
every
once
and
a
while
and
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
use
to
introduce
light
beer
drinkers
to
mircobrews
d
overall
nothing
all
that
extraordinary
with
this
one
it
is
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
cheers
d
pretty
good
beer
if
it
were
more
avalible
to
me
i
would
buy
it
from
time
to
time
not
bad
and
sort
of
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
homebrews
not
worth
seeking
out
regularly
but
worth
trying
for
sure
and
worth
enjoying
from
time
to
time
drinkability
not
a
bad
little
beer
would
recommend
to
others
trying
to
kick
their
macro
habit
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
this
beer
lacked
the
wow
factor
for
me
i
enjoy
a
well
crafted
light
abv
beer
but
this
seems
to
be
lacking
a
lot
of
things
overall
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
just
incase
i
got
a
old
bottle
i
am
hoping
because
i
like
southern
tier
but
they
seem
to
be
a
hit
or
miss
with
me
d
very
drinkable
and
well
rounded
the
hop
aroma
is
more
pungent
than
i
would
have
expected
with
a
big
whiff
of
pine
that
contrasts
the
rich
malt
character
nicely
the
flavor
is
more
mild
with
a
greater
emphasis
on
the
malt
but
there
is
still
enough
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
keep
the
beer
balanced
nicely
done
i
bought
this
beer
in
a
mixed
12
pack
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
the
other
2
bottles
from
the
pack
i
will
not
however
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
more
of
it
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
i
dont
think
i
even
want
to
finish
this
one
glass
it
just
isnt
very
tasty
for
an
apa
not
what
i
expected
ill
probably
try
another
bottle
next
time
i
see
one
just
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
bit
thin
but
good
apa
overall
poured
an
orangish
color
with
a
small
white
head

nice

to

and
coating

me
of
an
english
pale

the
mouthfeel

drinkable

this
is
actually
quite
a
nice

i
think
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
not
really
a
pale
ale
but
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
most
pilsners
and
other
beers
d
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
one
listed
an
apa
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
to
be
a
pale
ale
light
vibrant
easily
sessionable
but
otherwise
rather
uninteresting
i
suppose
this
one
could
be
an
everyday
drinker
but
i
personally
dont
think
ill
drink
it
ever
again
d
the
weakest
southern
tier
beer
ive
had
to
date
it
doesnt
showcase
much
but
its
not
bad
just
bland
nothing
stands
out
this
is
an
enjoyable
tasty
ale
but
like
most
of
the
other
viewers
it
is
not
extraordinary
i
nice
evening
ale
to
quaff
it
does
not
drink
like
a
5
6
abv
ale
deasy
drinker
here
decent
flavors
albeit
kind
of
faint
definitely
goes
down
smooth
but
the
bitterness
and
phenols
at
the
finish
detract
from
the
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
would
be
popular
in
the
summer
time
nothing
too
persuasive
one
way
or
the
other
just
a
good
solid
brew
this
would
be
a
easy
drinking
brew
that
would
be
good
to
bring
to
a
party
this
brew
would
not
offend
anyone
this
brew
is
a
decent
and
drinkable
good
just
not
great
aroma
and
taste
of
fresh
grain
and
cascade
hops
its
over
priced
and
under
qualified
ill
pass
on
this
and
have
a
sierra
pale
instead
thanks
pours
clear
orangy
with
lively
carbonation
producing
a
shortlived
head
the
aroma
is
cidery
and
a
little
thin
though
some
citrusy
hops
peer
out
as
the
beer
opens
the
aroma
is
flowery
and
little
citrusy
with
a
ciderlike
character
but
the
effect
is
weak
and
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
would
be
a
perfectly
adequate
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
nothing
to
get
the
tongue
excited
pale
hazed
deep
sunny
hue
slow
carbonation
is
noted
and
an
airy
white
head
of
decent
size
sits
on
top
lace
clings
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
like
its
holding
on
for
dear
life
the
aroma
is
citric
and
grapefruity
flavor
is
mellow
without
anything
really
making
an
impression
soft
malt
qualities
mixed
with
light
citrus
easy
going
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
average
all
around
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
fine
accompaniment
to
an
outdoor
summer
activity
d
again
way
too
much
carbonation
it
distracts
from
the
other
average
qualities
of
the
ale
d
not
bad
ive
had
better
from
southern
tier
especially
from
this
pack
of
pales
i
reviewed
this
weekend
its
certainly
a
creative
and
interesting
take
on
an
apa
it
pours
with
a
thick
and
creamy
head
lots
of
lacing
the
color
is
a
very
crisp
amber
perhaps
a
bit
too
fizzy
the
aroma
is
weak
with
boiled
hops
the
brew
is
a
bit
too
sweet
with
malt
upfront
the
hops
peek
in
the
middle
and
are
a
bit
present
in
the
finish
the
hops
get
a
bit
better
when
the
beer
gets
slightly
warmer
really
a
very
plain
pale
ale
slightly
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
nothing
off
putting
either
a
decent
session
beer
and
a
slight
step
up
from
a
middling
macrobrew
i
seriously
have
to
thank
my
favourite
bottleshop
once
again
for
venturing
out
and
finding
new
brews
many
thanks
to
adamjoel
and
berniethis
brew
pours
a
light
amber
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
half
finger
head
and
no
lacing
at
allthe
aroma
is
sweet
boiled
candypassionfruit
and
some
citrus
aswellit
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
which
is
neither
thick
nor
thin
and
easily
slides
down
with
tastes
of
passionfruitboiled
candy
and
a
little
hint
of
limeoverall
i
really
like
this
brew
and
could
drink
it
all
night
the
taste
comes
across
much
much
lighter
than
expected
but
its
rather
refreshing
much
more
breadybiscuity
mouthfeel
initially
comes
across
with
the
carbonation
but
flattens
out
a
bit
a
little
bitter
finish
that
i
like
but
would
like
some
sustaining
power
one
of
those
here
it
is
now
its
gone
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
but
something
is
missing
its
not
a
matter
of
subtlety
its
not
dull
at
all
very
drinkable
seems
like
a
lesser
abv
brew
a
summer
light
apa
for
sure
this
is
an
average
to
below
average
american
pale
ale
due
to
the
thin
body
and
weak
malt
profile
it
just
doesnt
taste
seem
to
be
a
very
high
quality
ale
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
solid
d
i
will
def
be
seeking
this
out
for
a
session
dgreat
tasting
sessionable
beer
would
have
this
again
very
easy
drinking
there
was
not
much
for
head
what
was
there
went
away
fast
and
left
just
a
little
island
in
the
middle
it
has
a
great
full
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
at
first
a
little
bit
piney
and
beany
the
body
is
thin
with
some
great
carbonation
it
has
a
grassy
and
dark
brass
colored
body
drinkability
as
far
as
being
able
to
drink
its
not
bad
i
mean
theres
nothing
notably
wrong
with
this
beer
other
then
the
fact
that
it
has
no
smell
or
flavor
this
is
not
something
i
would
waste
my
time
drinking
again
its
called
an
extraordinary
ale
why
drinkability
a
solid
effort
nothing
spectacular
more
hops
than
your
regular
apa
very
similar
to
their
ipa
with
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
so
i
like
this
one
better
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
feels
good
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
is
correct
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
while
watching
sports
on
t
v
d
good
which
is
also
true
to
the
style
but
this
is
rather
forgettable

this

overall
a
nice

with

drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
something
i
could
see
myself
substituting
for
any
macro
beer
when
drinking
more
then
a
few
with
macro
drinkers
nothing
over
the
top
with
taste
but
enjoyable
and
drinkable
d
a
pretty
average
to
slightly
above
average
pale
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
standard
st
pale
not
one
ill
seek
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
d
i
would
drink
this
again
and
its
very
sessionable
however
even
st
has
better
offerings
than
this
i
had
this
straight
from
the
bottle
without
appropriate
glassware
which
is
odd
for
me
ive
come
to
realize
that
any
beer
that
touts
the
words
extraordinary
or
divine
in
the
title
or
anything
of
the
sort
tend
to
be
anything
but
this
was
good
but
not
great
kind
of
watery
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
me
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
still
it
was
crisp
and
fairly
drinkable
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
feels
light
on
the
tongue
d
this
is
a
great
apa
tasty
and
sessionable
this
could
be
a
staple
in
your
fridge
dr
an
okay
brew
but
something
in
the

is
offputting

me

overall
a

overall
impression
this
beer
is
either
past
its
prime
or
just
not
good
its
still
mildly
drinkable
but
there
is
an
unpleasant
sour
note
that
takes
away
from
whatever
base
flavors
this
beer
has

though
more

could
have
benefited
this
beer
drink
is
decent
but
this
seems
to
have
some
off
flavors
to
me
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
p
a
i
look
forward
to
the
next
taste
is
of
grain
sour
malt
corn
a
sweetness
in
the
back
and
cornnuts
ends
thick
yet
dry
and
a
little
bitter
d
good
drinkability
just
not
great
though
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
apa
out
there
st
to
me
never
fails
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
brew
decent
enough
but
definitely
not
extraordinary
basic
flavors
and
a
week
presence
in
mouthfeel
make
this
a
nice
one
to
grab
just
to
have
a
decent
brew
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
has
a
decent
flavor
balance
but
lacks
in
significant
mouthfeel
and
doesnt
contain
anything
really
memorable
lightmedium
bodied
the
carbonation
stays
moderate
throughout
it
doesnt
set
itself
apart
in
a
sea
of
pale

decent

the
beer
is
clear
maybe
chill
hazed
an
amber
shade
of
yellow
with
a
thin
but
durable
wet
foam
of
spitty
consistency
the
smell
is
kind
of
muted
what
i
can
get
mostly
is
bready
or
peppercracker
maybe
just
a
little
light
citrus
the
taste
is
about
the
same
a
lot
of
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
really
a
good
combination
for
an
apa
good
carbonation
gives
a
peppery

this
is

as
a
st

should
be
but
not

easy

take
your

on
any
wild
rides
just

forward
beer
maybe
a
good
bridge
beer
for
the
non
craftys
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
wall
flower
solid
not
bad
but
forgettable
had
it
not
been
for
those
off
flavors
id
be
rateing
this
much
higher
i
wont
be
drinking
this
one
again
once
again
the
flavor
is
bland
and
uninspiring
watered
down
and
thin
bodied
with
subtle
floral
and
citrus
hops
and
a
caramel
malt
backbone
this
beer
is
well
balanced
but
is
pretty
boring
with
not
much
interesting
going
on
the
hops
are
not
very
bitter
and
only
have
a
slight
touch
of
citrus
fruit
a
pretty
drinkable
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
good
drinkability
tasty
beer
overall
this
isnt
really
that
extraordinary
i
enjoy
the
st
pale
ale
much
more
than
this
as
it
is
much
more
flavorful
a
good
apa
that
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
and
unfortunately
doesnt
live
up
to
its
name
not
terrible
but
not
extraordinary
not
bad
but
nothing
id
go
for
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
was
decent
this
may
not
be
the
tastiest
example
of
a
pale
out
out
there
it
is
indeed
far
from
extraordinary
but
it
is
quite
refreshing
nonetheless
i
could
imagine
this
pairing
well
with
a
variety
of
dishes
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
and
a
foamy
white
head
the
nose
is
of
citrusy
hops
and
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
nice
upfront
citrusy
earthy
hops
initially
and
has
an
extremely
smooth
finish
very
well
balanced
the
lightly
toasted
caramel
notes
complement
hop
flavor
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
between
the
excellent
taste
overall
smoothness
and
drinkability
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
does
qualify
as
an
extraordinary
ale
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
is
clear
yellow
with
almost
no
head
after
a
large
gulp
theres
a
nice
layer
of
sticky
lace
all
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
kiss
of
hops
a
faint
orange
fruit
aroma
is
detectable
as
well
the
flavor
is
malt
right
off
the
bat
with
a
fresh
hop
bite
that
comes
in
and
really
livens
things
up
they
balance
eachother
nicely
battling
for
my
tastebuds
attention
theres
a
slight
peach
aftertaste
that
sneaks
up
at
the
last
second
this
seems
light
bodied
to
me
fairly
light
and
crisp
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
helps
firm
thing
up
this
is
a
good
clean
apa
that
i
could
see
buying
a
sixer
of
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle

speak

okay
amount
of
carbonation

orange

mint
like
undertones
very
little
smell
faint
hops
very
easy
to
drink
an
ok
beer
but
hardly
extraordinary
smell
is
good
i
will
give
it
that
as
it
is
a
nice
hoppy
odor
appearance
is
kind
of
blah
a
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
taste
was
a
let
down
as
it
tasted
to
metallic
and
not
enough
hops
for
what
i
was
smelling
also
it
was
a
pretty
light
and
sudsy
brew
overall
it
has
decent
drinkabilty
not
a
bad
beer
but
by
no
means
but
extraordinary
i
think
not
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
with
i
small
head
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
a
roasted
malt
with
a
citrus
hop
to
balance
it
out
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
but
in
a
bad
way
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
is
not
good
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
the
overall
drinkability
is
okay
you
could
drink
a
lot
but
the
after
taste
would
bring
you
back
down
a
little
drinkability
i
would
have
another
if
i
wanted
to
stay
sober
for
the
rest
of
the
night
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
maybe
not
as
extraordinary
as
it
claims
to
be
but
pretty
decent
d
decent
drinker
but
nothing
stands
out
could
have
used
a
little
more
os
something
d
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
apa
and
didnt
go
near
the
other
two
that
came
in
the
mix
pack
i
wasnt
sorry
i
tried
it
but
id
be
sorry
if
i
went
and
bought
a
6pack
of
this
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
pretty
tight
thin
head
more
of
a
film
to
it
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
toasted
malts
biscuit
hops
and
a
bit
of
orange
taste
is
pretty
inline
with
the
nose
hop
flavoring
hits
up
front
moving
in
to
a
very
doughybiscuit
taste
then
the
orange
hits
you
and
finishes
with
light
toasted
malts
medium
bodied
beer
light
to
medium
carbonation
goes
down
with
a
slick
feel
and
finishes
dry
overall
its
a
decent
beer
with
good
drinkability
but
there
isnt
much
that
stands
out
drinkability
is
good
its
quenching
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
that
sports
a
summer
ipa
personality
wont
turn
heads
but
can
be
satisfying
as
a
thirst
quencher
drinkability
not
as
extraordinary
as
the
label
would
have
you
believe
notes
a
decent
brew
for
a
bbq
or
just
for
sessions
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
english
pale
ale
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
an
ok
brew
but
ill
pass
on
another
six
pack
d
a
very
nice
pale
ale
here
had
enough
balance
to
make
it
sessionable
and
tasted
good
enough
to
make
you
want
to
do
just
that
drinkability
solid
all
around
beer
i
could
make
this
a
regular
in
my
fridg
drinkability
great
easy
to
drink
and
moderately
interesting
bright
and
hoppy
this
is
exactly
what
id
expect
from
an
american
pale
ale
i
question
the
name
extraordinary
since
it
does
nothing
to
stand
out
in
the
style
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
but
dissipates
quickly
color
is
bright
gold
and
inviting
nearly
no
aroma
to
speak
of
a
faint
hops
scent
but
weaker
than
the
flavor
warrants
acceptable
but
wouldnt
seek
out
a
very
average
ale
slightly
bitter
but
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
great
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
i
huess
i
would
buy
again
right
price
and
decent
overall
got
this
beer
from
a
southern
tier
mixpack
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
decent
thick
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
like
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
is
sort
of
boring
plain
old
pale
ale
with
not
much
other
flavor
going
on
overall
this
beer
had
a
good
flavor
just
kind
of
plain
and
boring
drinkability
there
just
is
not
a
lot
of
taste
going
on
here
it
is
way
light
for
what
i
have
sampled
in
the
style
i
might
have
it
again
but
will
not
reach
for
it
lovely
moderately
hoppy
flavor
for
this
style
nice
lacing
aroma
was
consistent
with
the
taste
a
little
caramel
under
the
hop
when
lingered
tonguely
overall
a
very
nice
brew
i
believe
this
to
be
my
first
beer
from
this
brewer
would
like
to
have
had
this
one
from
the
tap
but
it
was
nice
just
the
same
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
very
thin
head
the
body
of
the
beer
is
slightly
foggy
which
is
a
thumbs
up
for
me
considering
i
enjoy
unfilterd
beers
from
looking
at
the
title
i
expected
something
to
really
impress
me
however
that
did
not
happen
but
all
things
considered
this
was
a
very
good
ale
i
would
not
vote
against
it
it
has
a
sweet
hoppy
aroma
with
a
moderately
hoppy
taste
which
shouldnt
offend
anyones
taste
buds
i
would
most
likely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
for
1
75
and
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
a
finger
of
tight
bone
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
grains
grassy
earthy
hops
and
hints
of
citrus
fruits
such
as
lemon
and
grapefruit
a
bit
thin
bodied
but
amply
carbonated
a
decent
warm
weather
quencher
definitely
clean
crisp
just
not
what
i
expected
mouthfeel
and
flavors
are
fairly
thin
and
less
than
impressive
overall
i
would
only
recommend
this
for
hot
summer
days
as
a
halfstep
up
from
macro
session
beers
medium
body
nice
tingly
carbonation
nice
smooth
texture
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
this
seems
like
it
would
be
an
excellent
gateway
craft
beer
not
the
classic
take
on
a
pale
ale
but
a
decent
effort
with
a
sweet
hop
twist
d
good
hot
day
drinker
for
that
purpose
it
gets
a
higher
drinkability
quite
drinkable
and
actually
delicious
unfortunately
light
on
the
malt
but
i
still
think
its
a
great
beer
just
for
the
hop
flavor
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
brilliant
clear
gold
with
less
than
a
finger
of
tight
bubbled
white
head
piney
hop
aroma
with
some
biscuity
malt
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
light
to
medium
bodied
could
use
a
little
more
malt
lots
of
carbonation
hops
provide
a
drying
finish
very
drinkable
a
solid
pale
ale
if
this
was
being
rated
against
every
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
probably
wouldnt
give
3
5s
on
the
smell
and
taste
but
since
it
is
a
weak
style
in
the
first
place
i
bumped
it
up
slightly
drinkability
taste
is
fine
goes
down
well
works
in
this
department
not
incredible
but
its
good
bitter
aroma
with
a
nice
scent
of
hops
like
planted
flowers
color
of
miller
lite
but
a
good
color
for
this
ale
unfortunately
it
tastes
like
miller
lite
with
better
hops
too
watery
not
enough
of
a
pale
ale
taste
it
is
a
good
hot
weather
beer
very
refreshing
i
cant
get
over
the
lack
of
taste
it
doesnt
stay
with
me
at
all
its
very
close
to
water
i
wouldnt
say
extraordinary
its
good
though
unfortunately
i
got
a
sixer
of
this
and
i
knew
i
would
be
able
to
really
dump
it
off
on
anybody
so
i
bit
the
bullet
i
wont
be
having
this
again
since
anyplace
that
would
have
it
on
tap
is
bound
to
have
a
better
beer
on
drinkability
not
overly
complex
but
a
highly
refreshing
beer
that
fits
the
style
well
and
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
as
i
said
its
not
a
typical
apa
but
its
still
easy
drink
drinkability
i
think
ill
stick
to
southern
tiers
big
beers
d
great
two
or
three
of
these
would
be
awesome
i
like
it
a
lot
d
good
balance
makes
this
easy
to
drink
could
have
a
few
more
m
watery
just
above
busch
light
in
terms
of
thickness
mediumlow
carbonation
i
love
their
other
beers
but
they
missed
the
boat
here
make
some
more
pumpking
ipas
or
imperials
dont
even
waste
your
time
with
this
one
i
never
see
people
drinking
it
and
when
they
do
they
say
they
dont
like
it
nearly
as
much
as
their
other
offerings
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
crystalclear
gold
with
medium
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
patches
of
lace
all
the
way
down
juicy
citrus
in
the
nose
but
a
bit
onesided
on
the
palate
herbal
and
minty
hops
make
way
for
tangerine
and
leafy
notes
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
malts
on
top
of
a
lightish
dry
body
that
leaves
a
light
finish
not
very
complex
but
its
a
refreshing
easily
sessionable
pale
ale
d
a
decent
beer
with
hints
of
something
that
is
way
out
of
place
namely
noble
hops
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
in
its
own
right
but
its
not
very
good
for
a
pale
ale
very
good
nice
drinkable
take
on
the
style
drinkability
i
could
knock
back
six
of
these
and
want
more
i
did
not
expect
to
like
this
maybe
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
light
refreshing
taste
tonight
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
and
made
me
happy
tastes
of
strong
citrus
hops
beating
up
some
poor
thick
sweet
malt
far
from
balanced
more
balanced
and
piney
as
it
warms
but
still
hop
domination
heavy
fizzy
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
almost
forgot
i
was
drinking
beer
it
could
have
club
soda
not
my
idea
of
an
extraordinary
ale
drinkability
pretty
high
could
be
higher
with
a
little
better
carbonation
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
id
like
a
bit
of
a
stronger
presence
in
the
taste
compared
to
3fs
alpha
king
this
apa
is
a
little
light
but
still
pretty
good
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
with
a
lower
abv

you
can
drink
a
few
of
them
happily
had
this
on
tap
good
copper
amber
hue
you
can
smell
the
aromatic
hops
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
maltiness
and
citrusy
hops
with
a
crisp
finish
without
an
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
a
great
beer
for
all
occasions
would
recommend
and
drink
again
found
the
taste
to
improve
after
it
aired
out
and
i
became
accustomed
to
the
hop
attack
settled
into
the
apa
category
as
the
glass
emptied
with
a
sour
malt
flavor
would
be
a
good
spring

beer

d
i
could
easily
kill
six
of
these
and
want
one
more
overall
another
good
choice
by
southern
tier
which
is
becoming
one
of
my
more
favored
breweries
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
orange
heavy
citrus
and
doughy
malt
there
is
an
overripe
sweetness
in
the
aroma
that
leads
me
to
believ
that
this
isnt
going
to
taste
good
and
it
doesnt
ive
actually
had
a
couple
of
these
just
in
case
i
had
got
a
bad
bottle
but
alas
this
is
what
the
brewers
were
shooting
for
and
i
guess
they
succeeded
im
not
a
fan
fruity
sweet
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
balnd
caramel
malt
and
subtle
bitterness
its
medium
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
its
not
very
drinkable
maybe
im
going
heavy
on
personal
preference
on
this
review
but
the
blend
of
malts
and
hops
just
arent
working
for
me
id
suggest
skipping
this
one
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
shaker
this
pale
ale
poured
a
fairly
clear
golden
amber
hue
with
a
thin
head
of
beige
foam
that
settled
into
a
lasting
film
some
nice
even
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
mild
caramel
dried
oranges
and
citrus
the
flavor
included
thin
malts
and
faint
citrus
a
bland
mix
of
caramel
and
oranges
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
had
moderate
carbonation
bland
and
amazingly
dull
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
cloudy
and
had
a
very
nice
goldish
hue
to
it
the
beer
had
a
very
nice
big
white
head
that
was
very
pleasant
the
beer
was
very
refreshing
and
was
crisp
and
very
clean
to
drink
i
though
the
beer
was
nothing
special
but
because
it
was
so
clean
i
gave
it
a
goo
rateing
and
will
buy
again
d
very
drinkable
apa
smooth
and
buttery
i
could
drink
this
as
an
all
year
session
brew
golf
course
worthy
here
in
florida
a
bit
thin
decent
body
but
makes
for
an
easy
drinker
goes
down
easy
not
my
favorite
apa
but
better
than
average
a
good
summer
ale
pours
a
clear
ambergolden
yellow
medium
size
and
thick
white

slowly
drops
to
a

crackerybready

caramel
lemon
sharpness
in
the
finish
with
a
bready
dryness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
slightly
high
carbonation
definitely
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
overall
an
average
pale
ale
but
pretty
solid
aroma
is
nice
but
the
flavour
just
doesnt
match
it
d
have
to
admit
that
the
beer
grew
on
me
at
first
my
ratings
were
a
bit
on
the
low
side
but
as
i
drank
the
beer
changed
a
bit
i
still
like
some
of
there
bigger
beers
better
but
this
is
a
good
beer
in
its
own
circle
d
probably
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
that
it
really
does
go
down
smoothly
and
coupled
with
a
pleasant
if
uninspired
taste
does
lead
to
a
very
drinkable
beer
everything
considered
even
though
its
a
tad
above
5
abv
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
and
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
nice
summer
day
when
a
light
but
not
so
light
as
to
be
disposable
beer
is
called
for
i
could
easily
see
myself
kicking
back
with
a
few
of
these
and
come
lime
chips
but
since
its
the
heart
of
fall
now
ill
consider
this
a
lessthanextraordinarybutstillsolid
american
pale
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
for
those
unaccustomed
to
this
style
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
very
active
carbonation
the
head
is
a
little
offwhite
and
is
incredibly
thick
and
retentive
the
smell
is
a
nice
grassy
hop
a
little
bit
of
pine
as
well
very
fresh
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
i
have
never
had
such
a
clean
crisp
and
smooth
apa
the
hops
are
up
front
grassy
and
floral
then
there
is
a
very
quick
pale
malt
burst
that
has
a
sort
of
nutty
character
slightly
soapy
taste
in
the
head
it
ends
with
a
tonguetingling
fizz
then
the
flavor
quickly
fads
until
the
next
sip
perfect
summer
beer
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
would
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
pitchers
for
a
session
not
a
great
beer
but
nice
and
light
with
a
mild
but
distinctive
taste
this
beer
pours
a
dark
yellowgolden
color
with
a
very
wisp
head
that
quickly
disappeared
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
present
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hoppy
background
and
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
medium
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
malt
graininess
with
some
round
bitterness
throughout
this
is
an
average
brew
and
thats
that
poured
a
clear
golden
with
minimal
carbonation
and
almost
no
head
some
sediment
found
in
glass
aroma
is
unmistakingly
cascade
hops
sweet
caramel
malts
flavor
is
citrus
and
pine
backed
by
light
fruity
sweetness
thin
texture
abrupt
bitter
finish
overall
a
nice
smaller
apa
a
nice
solid
brew
from
souther
tier
here
for
a
pale
ale
it
is
quite
hoppy
but
the
best
part
of
it
is
its
drinkability
a
great
taste
light
bodied
and
a
low
enough
abv
to
not
make
you
half
in
the
bag
an
easy
drinker
from
a
great
brewery
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
copper
and
lemon
hops
balanced
with
light
barley
malt
it
tasted
like
wet
caramel
malt
with
bitter
copper
and
floral
hops
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
brief
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
beer
with
good
flavors
although
they
were
a
bit
generic
it
was
very
drinkable
but
i
fail
to
see
what
makes
this
an
extraordinary
ale
to
me
it
was
quite
ordinary
this
is
one
really
drinkable
beer
i
love
it
drinkability
a
solid
brew
and
one
thats
easily
sessionable
the
complexitys
lacing
the
balanced
is
good
and
its
tasty
overall
im
glad
i
got
a
sixpack
there
are
better
examples
out
there
but
this
is
a
more
mild
sessionable
version
i
would
say
and
i
did
enjoy
it
drinkability
an
average
pale
ale
from
an
above
average
brewery
that
i
dont
mind
supporting
alcohols
manageable
of
course
and
the
hop
presence
is
nice
but
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
drinkability
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
barbecue
or
a
quality
mett
extraordinary
of
course
not
a
worthy
session
apa
by
all
means
golden
body
with
a
large
sticky
white
head
very
impressive
appearance
pine
and
citrus
nose
citrus
and
floral
hops
in
the
flavour
along
with
some
light
malt
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
anchor
liberty
mediumlight
body
with
an
aggressive
carbonation
providing
a
crisp
mouthfeel
extremely
good
drinkability
the
crispness
and
nice
hopping
make
for
a
refreshing
beer
which
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
m
d
that
carbonation
that
made
the
glass
tough
to
fill
makes
the
beer
a
little
tough
to
drink
carbonation
is
a
bit
intense
and
overdone
making
the
body
feel
a
little
more
foamy
and
seemingly
lacking
substance
though
i
know
thats
not
the
case
if
this
could
be
overcome
it
would
be
far
more
pleasant
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
to
see
what
another
bottle
was
like
though
good
drinkability
goes
down
easy
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
my
glass
with
a
one
finger
nearlywhite
head
that
sadly
displayed
poor
retention
laces
beautifully
though
the
color
was
a
gorgeous
true
gold
great
aromas
of
citrus
zest
some
maltiness
and
fresh
green
hops
the
beer
was
very
smooth
on
my
palate
and
had
a
nice
liveliness
on
my
tongue
flavors
of
citric
hops
honey
caramel
malts
and
a
hoppy
finish
needs
a
little
more
malt
balance
especially
at
the
end
medium
carbonation
good
example
of
an
american
ale
golden
amber
looks
with
a
thin
head
quite
appetizing
aroma
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
and
spice
also
quite
attractive
a
sip
of
this
will
have
you
wondering
if
you
misread
the
label
an
interesting
touch
of
cloves
lemon
zest
orange
peel
in
between
spurts
of
hop
bitterness
its
definitely
a
unique
apa
worth
trying
and
with
its
smooth
medium
body
it
is
easily
enjoyed
dont
drink
and
review
d
i
quite
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
one
but
the
taste
left
something
to
be
desired
all
told
id
have
this
one
again
but
not
at
all
living
up
to
the
other
st
brews
ive
had
drinkability
my
first
try
from
southern
tier
and
i
am
very
impressed
an
excellent
blend
of
malt
and
hops
with
nothing
too
over
the
top
not
sure
of
abv
but
seems
like
a
great
session
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
the
aftertaste
throws
me
off
a
little
but
otherwise
not
a
bad
session
beer
your
average
pale
ale
nothing
special
d
decent
drinkability
drinks
like
a
pale
though
flavor
may
get
tiresome
if
drinking
a
six
pack
at
a
time
i
had
this
beer
as
part
of
a
12
pack
sampler
it
is
a
nice
orangey
color
smell
has
big
hop
notes
along
with
caramel
malt
had
a
semi
heavy
mouthfeel
taste
has
a
lot
of
hop
bitter
with
some
malt
finish
i
thought
this
was
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
beer
tastes
just
like
it
smells
malty
hoppy
a
little
sweet
it
finishes
with
some
breadiness
and
a
little
spice
nice
carbonation
in
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
at
the
end
i
was
happy
to
find
out
that
the
apple
juice
was
isolated
to
the
aroma
if
it
wasnt
then
this
beer
would
have
been
a
disaster
its
not
really
an
extraordinary
ale
but
it
is
a
rather
decent
sessionable
one
from
sothern
tier
i
will
not
be
buying
another
of
these
it
turns
out
that
theres
really
nothing
extrordinary
about
this
pale
ale
except
that
the
brewing
company
thinks
that
the
beer
is
extraordinary
but
as
pale
ales
go
it
compares
well
to
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
even
if
its
lighter
in
body
and
taste
very
sessionable
without
requiring
much
thought
regrettably
the
beer
probably
falls
in
the
forgettable
catagory
d
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
hops
flavor
d
id
probably
pass
on
this
one
again
its
ok
but
not
great
d
it
was
pretty
drinkable
but
i
think
it
would
suit
better
for
an
ipa
even
though
it
was
more
malty
than
one
a
pale
gold
color
presented
itself
with
a
mild
head
that
died
quickly
a
hoppy
smell
with
citric
notes
but
nothing
spectacular
for
a
pale
ale
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
was
the
dryness
from
it
the
hops
lent
itself
in
this
category
more
towards
an
ipa
the
taste
is
rather
subdued
with
some
citric
notes
such
as
lemon
juice
and
some
possible
caramel
malts
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
i
just
wouldnt
bother
having
this
over
and
over
notes
overall
it
has
a
strong
hop
presence
with
an
easy
to
drink
refreshing
palate
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
extraordinary
there
is
a
drink
in
greece
made
with
citrus
preserves
you
put
in
water
this
is
what
it
tastes
like
love
it
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
climbing
up
the
glass
there
is
a
two
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
and
some
solid
lacing
lots
of
different
aromas
passion
fruit
grapefruit
citrus
and
some
spices
including
black
pepper
tropical
fruit
flavors
lead
to
a
mix
of
grapefruit
and
orange
hops
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
medium
carbonation
light
body
there
is
a
cleansing
mouthfeel
like
drinking
soda
water
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
but
nothing
special
mfd
good
overall
ale
id
drink
this
one
again
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
and
gives
me
even
more
confidence
to
say
that
southern
tier
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
very
bubbly
goes
down
pretty
easy
id
disagree
with
the
word
extraordinary
but
its
decent
not
really
anything
id
seek
out
though
there
are
much
better
pale
ales
i
put
this
one
in
the
upper
category
of
apas
since
its
so
full
of
flavor
and
fun
to
drink
really
strong
hop
flavor
from
the
very
first
sip
basic
gold
sort
of
boring
color
its
unique
enough
of
a
beer
to
have
maybe
a
little
redrye
tinge
to
it
thats
what
i
would
have
done
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
theyre
going
for
a
little
astringent
on
the
finish
sort
of
kills
the
allout
hop
heaven
you
get
to
experience
beforehand
would
buy
again
drinkability
typical
for
an
apa
the
over
use
of
hops
puts
the
beer
to
a
slight
imbalance
but
it
is
standard
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
example
although
there
are
better
out
there
could
be
an
ipa
d
very
drinkable
sessionable
brew
tasty
but
still
fairly
light
tasting
sweet
but
not
cloying
very
welll
balanced
a
good
beer
good
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
level
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
with
no
hints
of
dryness
left
behind
on
the
palate
md
medium
bodied
and
slighlty
chewy
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
drinks
easy
a
solid
apa
pours
an
almost
clear
golden
color
w
a
decent
white
head
which
dissipates
immediatly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
nonic
the
subtle
smell
is
predominately
piney
citrus
w
a
hint
of
bread
nuts
a
slightly
thin
flavor
but
a
good
one
nontheless
more
piney
hop
here
w
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
crackerish
malt
backbone
some
mineral
in
the
finish
tastes
like
an
esb
not
really
a
dry
beer
but
has
the
feel
of
one
lightbodied
w
a
decent
level
of
co2
very
drinkable
something
i
could
easily
drink
all
summer
long
this
is
a
good
beer
a
bit
style
confused
maybe
but
it
is
a
solid
beverage
to
enjoy
kudos
for
the
interesting
citrus
notes
that
i
kept
trying
to
place
but
exceptional
turned
to
boredom
midway
thru
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
lightish
a
good
apa
here
with
the
hops
definitely
playing
second
fiddle
for
me
so
its
almost
more
of
an
english
pa
to
my
tastes
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
southern
tier
line
and
id
happily
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
lets
be
honest
this
isnt
actually
an
extraordinary
ale
there
are
lots
of
good
solid
pale
ales
out
there
and
this
is
but
one
of
them
so
maybe
the
name
is
misleading
but
theres
not
a
damn
thing
wrong
with
it
either
obviously
pretty
high
drinkability
here
this
beer
starts
out
with
lots
of
promise
but
is
a
slight
let
down
the
beer
pours
a
goldeny
honey
color
with
a
smallish
head
that
rims
the
glass
and
dissipates
no
retention
that
i
can
detect
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
quite
carbonated
the
smell
is
piney
hop
notes
some
berry
like
citrus
the
taste
begins
with
some
piney
hop
notes
nice
bready
malts
and
some
orange
hints
there
is
a
sweetish
berry
flavor
to
this
beer
in
the
backbone
that
compromises
what
could
be
some
nice
resinous
estery
hop
flavors
the
cloying
sweetness
detracts
too
much
from
the
hoppy
base
this
beer
should
have
maintained
the
finish
has
an
ever
so
slight
tartness
or
tang
not
bad
though
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
fine
and
there
isnt
much
aftertaste
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
great
apa
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
very
slightly
hazy
orange
yellow
that
left
little
to
no
head
although
it
did
leave
white
rings
of
lacing
after
each
sip
the
smell
was
a
blend
of
citrus
and
hops
candied
orange
with
floral
hop
hints
tasted
decent
with
hoppy
citrus
flavors
followed
by
a
faint
malty
character
decent
carbonation
with
a
slightly
bready
feel
overall
a
decent
beer
though
i
felt
the
flavor
fell
a
little
flat
worth
trying
but
dont
kill
yourself
trying
to
track
this
one
down
d
medium
bodied
and
nicely
drinkable
pale
ale
strong
on
the
hops
but
does
not
get
too
carried
away
tastes
like
a
bitterer
version
of
a
fat
tire
i
liked
it
though
i
dont
picture
this
becoming
a
regular
staple
orange
colored
beer
with
a
quickly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
both
citrus
and
malt
light
carbonation
makes
this
a
bit
easier
to
drink
there
is
absolutely
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
very
bland
and
boring
just
another
apa
that
is
overhyped
on
this
site
drinkability
theres
nothing
particularly
extraordinary
about
this
beer
in
my
opinion
but
its
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
sierra
nevada
mold
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
in
the
right
circumstances
d
great
session
beer
good
representation
of
the
style
looking
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
these
in
the
up
coming
summer
months
recommended
thumbs
up
all
the
way
d
a
nice
apa
from
southern
tier
the
alcohol
is
very
low
making
this
warm
weather
sessionable
southern
tier
usually
does
a
lot
better
with
their
bigger
bottled
beers
and
this
one
seemed
pretty
average
and
runofthemill
with
a
light
unassuming
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkabiilty
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
very
crisp
carbonation
is
very
good
and
its
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
from
southern
tier
ive
had
better
of
this
style
but
its
a
pretty
good
option
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smelled
of
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
some
sweet
malts
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
didnt
think
it
was
going
to
be
an
apa
the
bottle
said
extraordinary
ale
so
apa
didnt
even
cross
my
mind
the
taste
was
grassy
and
floral
hops
with
a
citrus
zing
that
was
sweet
and
tart
in
the
finish
i
love
this
beer
i
tend
to
not
drink
hoppy
pale
beer
so
i
cant
tell
if
its
a
great
rendition
of
the
style
but
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
overall
a
great
session
beer
from
a
great
brewery
pale
amber
in
color
with
a
huge
head
that
just
keeps
buildinginfected
not
quite
a
gusher
but
fairly
hoppy
aroma
with
a
sightly
sour
bite
to
it
somewhat
malty
flavor
with
a
decent
helping
of
bitterness
i
get
a
very
sharp
somewhat
tart
wang
right
up
front
ok
mouthfeelfailry
even
and
uneventful
the
sharp
flavor
tends
to
detract
from
a
fairly
average
beer
i
think
this
may
be
off
and
will
try
again
but
overall
a
very
average
pale
ale
i
am
trying
not
to
over
think
this
beer
it
is
a
quality
product
with
some
great
flavors
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
happy
that
my
desire
to
explore
paid
off
this
could
def
make
its
way
into
the
summer
rotation
dim
glad
i
tried
it
and
its
good
but
its
got
no
distinguishing
features
that
set
it
apart
from
other
similar
styles
i
found
this
one
rather
enjoyable
it
had
the
hopiness
but
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
its
also
just
above
the
level
of
a
normal
session
ale
but
not
too
strong
recommended
light
honey
golden
color
with
a
thin
but
sudsy
white
head
that
clings
a
bit
to
the
glass
first
aroma
of
dryhopped
cascades
second
aroma
of
nothing
in
particular
third
aroma
of
pilsnerlike
malt
flavor
is
more
malty
than
hoppy
a
slightly
dry
cracker
malty
i
suppose
lighttomedium
body
almost
like
a
pilsner
im
getting
a
lot
of
alarming
pilsner
qualities
here
from
the
color
aroma
body
and
now
even
the
flavor
the
saving
grace
is
the
restrained
ale
fruitiness
that
pokes
its
head
out
on
alternate
sips
saving
grace
as
in
it
is
saved
from
suspicion
that
this
really
is
a
pilsner
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
but
shares
with
the
dry
malt
and
dammit
here
comes
that
pilsner
again
extraordinary
well
the
clear
and
bright
color
was
nice
and
i
guess
the
whole
pilsner
aspect
i
detected
could
be
considered
extraordinary
but
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
there
is
something
missing
here
though
maybe
the
body
finishing
hops
not
dry
hops
and
aftertaste
could
be
tooled
around
with
but
i
bet
this
would
get
better
reviews
if
it
came
freshly
caskconditioned
and
people
were
told
it
was
from
england
very
drinkable
overall
even
if
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
this
style
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
either
oxidation
or
an
intentional
aroma
produced
by
hops
or
yeast
the
aroma
was
cardboardy
almost
skunked
either
way
all
of
the
bottles
in
this
sixpack
were
not
very
pleasant
the
body
of
the
beer
was
thin
and
the
presence
of
hops
is
negligable
i
bought
this
beer
expecting
more
based
on
some
recommendations
about
this
brewery
i
can
only
hope
that
their
other
offerings
are
better
than
this
one
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
has
a
decent
balance
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
d
ok
not
a
great
ale
but
not
bad
either
this
is
a
good
apa
but
far
from
extraordinary
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
work
but
otherwise
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
looks
like
a
pilsnery
pale
ale
with
very
little
bubbles
and
a
sparse
had
the
aroma
is
a
little
piney
with
some
hard
mineral
dry
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
metallicdry
but
sill
pleasantly
hoppy
not
as
flavorful
as
expected
prety
light
refreshing
just
pretty
standard
d
pale
ales
are
so
easy
to
drink
and
this
one
is
no
exception
just
a
tad
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
solid
flavor
and
aroma
overall
i
think
if
you
were
to
consider
a
beer
for
a
typical
mainstream
session
apa
this
one
would
be
in
the
running
i
mean
i
might
not
consider
it
as
extraordinary
as
they
do
but
neither
can
i
solidly
disrespect
it
in
fact
the
sum
of
the
parts
yields
a
rather
high
drinkability
quotient
so
its
not
as
big
bold
or
impressive
as
many
other
southern
tier
offerings
thats
all
right
because
id
feel
at
home
with
this
most
days
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
about
3
inches
frothy
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
very
good
aroma
is
mostly
floralcitrusy
hops
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
sweet
malt
in
there
too
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
more
hops
noticable
than
malt
but
its
not
a
hop
bomb
either
mouthfeelbody
is
light
but
with
way
way
too
much
carbonation
it
almost
seems
like
im
drinking
zippy
little
bubbles
and
not
beer
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
carbonation
i
think
if
the
carbonation
was
cut
down
a
bit
maybe
there
was
something
slightly
wrong
with
this
batch
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
it
tasted
and
smelled
good
but
the
carbonation
hurt
this
beer
imo
ill
try
it
again
in
the
future
and
see
how
it
is
poured
into
a
pint
glass
surly
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
plus
foamy
white

this

this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beers
bring
it
to
a
party
give
it
to
your
friends
maybe
it
will
get
them
into

earthy
herbal
hops
and
a
slight
honeyish
aftertaste
long
after
its
gone
hints
of
puffed
wheat
too
but
not
distracting
in
this
pale
ale
moderate
body
not
thin
well
balanced
with
ample
carbonation
the
glass
disappeared
in
5
minutes
after
the
1st
sip
if
thats
any
indication
of
being
sessionable
phin
matts
makes
a
great
session
beer
it
is
wonderfully
light
with
still
enough
body
there
to
let
you
know
you
are
drinking
a
fine
micro
brew
this
beer
makes
a
great
beer
for
parties
it
is
light
for
the
miller
lite
crowd
but
has
a
nice
hop
touch
for
people
looking
for
something
a
little
more
serious
also
if
it
is
availble
to
you
it
is
a
cylinder
to
have
in
the
kegerator
pours
a
light
amber
in
color
with
1
12
finger
head
and
average
lacing
the
smell
is
of
grass
floral
hops
and
something
i
can
only
describe
as
plastic
the
taste
is
much
less
offensive
coming
in
with
a
grainy
malt
backbone
and
some
grassy
hops
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
for
an
apa
but
for
me
thats
not
a
bad
thing
the
mouthfeel
in
drinkability
are
ok
not
as
impressed
as
i
am
with
some
other
things
from
southern
tier
but
not
bad
as
long
as
i
dont
get
my
nose
to
deep
into
it
dphin
and
matts
extraordinary
ale
is
a
good
description
if
you
were
to
leave
off
the
prefix
this
is
most
definitely
ordinary
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
not
so
sure
i
should
have
bought
the
sixer
oh
well
it
is
drinkable
d
very
easy
drinking
with
this
one
so
far
into
it
seems
like
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
could
drink
this
baby
all
night
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
in
taste
and
complexity
but
i
was
not
dissappointed
i
will
get
this
one
again
would
be
great
to
have
during
partys
with
pizza
and
freinds
and
just
hanging
out
when
you
wanna
have
a
few
in
a
row
and
not
be
smashed
already
didnt
really
get
much
out
of
this
one
the
pour
was
very
yellow
and
as
such
much
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
this
looked
almost
like
a
macro
but
not
quite
smell
was
very
average
with
some
noticeable
sweet
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
but
little
else
taste
too
was
very
forgetable
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
very
mild
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
i
was
ready
for
overall
a
very
average
apa
thats
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
exciting
hohum
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
great
brew
but
worth
a
try
it
is
diferent
mk
pours
a
clouded
golden
brown
with
a
big
offwhite
head
off
a
very
aggressive
pour
that
falls
rather
quickly
nose
is
a
typical
citrus
hop
flavor
is
smoothly
and
mildly
sweet
with
an
even
and
not
overpowering
hop
presence
feel
is
nice
good
level
of
bubble
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
liquid
feel
drinkable
yes
for
being
labeled
an
extraordinary
ale
i
dont
find
this
one
as
such
it
is
still
pretty
good
though
and
worth
trying
and
very
quaffable
pretty
nice
stuff
would
go
well
with
most
foods
and
satisfy
a
broad
spectrum
of
moods
appears
with
chill
haze
golden
copper
color
forms
a
vibrant
white
head
pretty
thick
as
it
dwindles
a
collar
of
lacing
forms
with
each
sip
after
the
first
even
lacing
forms
thinly
in
speckled
patterns
aroma
has
a
light
pale
biscuit
malt
component
with
citrus
peel
and
very
floral
hops
arising
mellow
but
you
can
detect
grain
and
hop
here
thats
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
anybodys
flagship
beer
lets
see
how
those
carry
out
in
the
flavor
hoppy
in
the
floral
and
citrus
burp
sense
not
overly
bitter
im
detecting
moderate
ibus
possibly
around
35
on
the
hop
bitterness
mild
sweetness
with
pale
malts
bringing
out
biscuit
and
cereal
grains
with
a
mineral
water
harshness
in
the
finish
texture
is
pretty
light
this
is
pale
ale
light
in
a
good
way
really
light
body
with
some
thinner
resinous
slickness
and
carbonation
thats
dead
on
drinkability
is
pretty
effortless
a
good
tailgating
craft
beer
much
flavor
but
light
texture
and
crispness
makes
it
flow
with
ease
a
really
great
tasting
and
refreshing
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
brewers
quite
a
nice
beer
recommended
very
average
at
best
drinkability
pretty
refreshing
after
a
bruising
soccer
match
pours
a
pale
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
upfront
with
the
maltiness
shining
through
as
well
taste
is
very
nice
and
toasty
upfront
with
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
middle
a
second
taste
confirms
the
toastiness
and
malt
that
shows
through
much
more
than
the
hops
feels
more
like
a
wellbalanced
english
ipa
but
for
what
its
worth
its
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
i
could
kick
back
on
a
hot
day
highly
sessionable
thanks
beertruth
keep
those
st
gems
coming
drinkability
yes
highly
recommended
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
theses
this
was
fairly
decent
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
spicy
foods
to
cut
the
heat
and
still
remain
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
though
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
fairly
easy
to
drink
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
well
balanced
enjoyable
all
around
became
more
complex
as
it
warmed
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
unless
youre
looking
for
something
stronger
otherwise
the
beer
is
quite
satisfying
if
you
want
something
sessionable
but
with
a
lot
of
substance
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
small
bubbles
along
the
top
smell
is
earthy
piney
hops
absolutely
delicious
for
a
pale
ale
taste
is
a
smooth
malt
and
earthy
hops
balance
nice
carbonation
on
this
one
makes
this
border
on
a
session
versus
too
filling
for
more
than
2
i
have
loved
everything
from
southern
tier
very
good
beer
pertfect
beer
n
easy
drinker
very
refreshing
funny
i
had
a
rogue
american
amber
last
night
and
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
lighter
version
the
key
here
is
theres
a
significant
yeast
character
than
blends
with
the
caramel
malt
the
pacman
yeast
for
rogue
and
whatever
st
uses
the
light
malt
body
is
surrounded
by
a
tangy
but
not
strong
citrus
hops
note
that
lends
a
decent
bitterness
overall
the
malt
and
overall
flavor
profile
are
a
bit
lacking
the
hops
arent
that
distinguishable
or
complex
but
this
still
makes
for
a
decent
session
brew
not
bad
but
definitely
not
great
overall
a
great
session
beer
very
easy
on
the
palate
but
very
tasty
recommended
d
a
very
good
session
beer
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
thats
exactly
what
this
is
completely
and
totally
mediocre
i
could
drink
a
few
without
batting
an
eye
neither
in
a
good
way
nor
a
bad
pours
a
light
gold
with
little
head
i
found
the
color
to
be
a
bit
watery
looking
taste
has
mild
sweetness
and
a
decently
strong
hop
sense
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
simple
drinkability
is
high
actually
was
a
good
experience
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
spicy
hops
that
are
noticeable
in
the
finish
in
my
opinion
save
this
beer
from
a
watery
grave
without
them
this
is
a
bland
conservative
ale
certainly
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
while
it
probably
wont
find
its
way
into
my
current
beer
rotation
it
might
appeal
to
fans
of
lighter
sweeter
pale
ales
pours
a
clean
copper
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
dry
maltiness
and
a
small
hop
presence
the
taste
well
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
but
not
much
to
say
although
it
is
good
a
nice
body
and
no
aftertaste
sessionish
and
a
good
palate
clensor
all
i
can
say
it
is
just
a
good
ale
pours
a
pale
golden
orange
color
with
an
average
with
head
that
left
so
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
rather
faint
for
an
apa
some
real
light
citris
hop
the
taste
is
a
bit
odd
i
am
picking
up
some
apricot
flavors
a
slight
metallic
taste
a
quick
citris
hop
taste
and
pale
malt
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
crisp
and
well
carbonated
balanced
finish
a
different
take
on
the
apa
with
the
apricot
flavor
sticking
out
for
me
good
but
not
in
the
same
class
with
sierra
nevada
jeff
cabral
a
nice
golden
brown
color
but
weak
in
headlace
category
has
an
interesting
smell
of
sweet
malt
fruit
nougat
a
bit
flowery
tastes
of
sweet
bread
blended
with
a
citrus
highlight
mildly
carbonated
and
kind
of
watery
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
has
enough
hops
feel
to
keep
it
on
the
good
side
of
the
scale
needs
a
little
more
body
to
really
make
this
more
desirable
certainly
worth
a
try
and
i
would
drink
it
again
a
light
amber
color
pour
into
a
glass
that
never
had
much
of
a
head
from
the
get
go
first
hit
was
a
slight
piney
and
bitterness
again
slight
the
bitterness
from
the
first
hit
seemed
to
dissipate
as
the
drink
went
on
resembled
a
bully
lager
in
terms
of
taste
and
smell
more
than
a
pale
ale
in
a
good
way
this
is
not
a
slam
would
definetely
recommend
this
for
a
picnic
or
all
night
affair
although
not
extraordinary
still
a
solid
offering
from
southern
tier
who
seldom
disappoints
would
buy
this
again
d
very
drinkable
no
off
tastes
liked
it
a
lot
would
definitely
buy
it
again
mouthfeel
feels
great
southern
tier
is
a
top
tier
brewery
and
this
is
one
of
its
best
offerings
especially
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
the
pale
aleslike
myself
md
very
smooth
yet
crisp
enough
to
make
you
want
another
sip
its
a
warm
humid
summer
night
and
the
beer
is
warm
but
it
still
shined
the
sweetness
sticks
to
the
palate
and
the
drinkability
is
great
like
most
pale
ales
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
anticipated
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
normally
i
never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
but
they
should
rethink
the
packaging
it
doesnt
sell
the
product
well
at
all
and
even
though
i
really
like
it
i
dont
pay
attention
to
it
on
the
shelf
smooth
with
decent
carbonation
fairly
dry
light
to
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
a
decent
wellbalanced
pale
ale
though
not
extraordinary
imo
overall
impression
awesome
ordinary
bitter
style
beer
balanced
to
perfection
has
that
delicious
bitter
bite
that
doesnt
linger
which
is
great
this
is
a
great
session
beer
pretty
average
all
around
d
a
decent
malty
ale
with
a
dryish
aftertaste
this
isnt
quite
to
the
level
of
dales
as
far
as
im
concerned
but
its
a
good
beer
i
would
definitely
give
this
to
someone
who
is
transitioning
out
of
american
macros
and
into
the
good
stuff
a
good
addition
to
the
southern
tier
variety
pack
that
i
probably
wouldnt
have
tried
otherwise
a
good
drinker
and
an
enjoyable
session
beer
cheers
drinkability
outstanding
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
indeed
just
wonderful
d
this
is
a
great
refreshing
apa
for
anytime
easy
to
drink
and
probably
easy
to
session
to
ill
probably
have
this
one
again
overall
high
drinkability
because
of
its
subdued
bitterness
a
nice
beer
to
introduce
a
novice
to
the
style
nothing
over
the
top
just
classic
citrus
hop
and
slight
pine
flavors
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
may
have
to
session
this
one
drinkability
is
the
real
strength
of
this
beer
a
favorable
and
easy
to
drink
ale
pours
out
a
light
honeyiced
tea
mix
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
in
the
body
and
a
thinnish
head
solid
apa
nose
with
lots
of
citrus
and
some
grassy
tones
toasted
malt
and
toffee
in
the
background
of
course
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
a
nottooclean
malt
base
with
its
fruity
esters
and
big
citrus
from
the
hops
bitterness
is
rather
minimal
considering
the
hop
flavors
has
a
bitty
of
a
jelly
worm
taste
carbonation
is
mellow
and
pleasing
while
the
body
isnt
too
thick
solid
drinkability
and
a
pretty
flavorful
apa
d
ok
but
not
a
must
have
would
be
good
for
a
session
style
beer
phin
and
matts
extraordinary
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
gold
aroma
is
sweet
almost
wort
like
caramel
malts
flavor
is
smooth
and
malty
with
just
a
twinge
of
slighlty
metallic
hops
delicious
and
balanced
im
definitely
gonna
have
to
get
this
one
again
overall
a
nice
easy
ale
to
drink
not
extraordinary
but
good
never
less
carbonation
is
near
perfect
and
helps
with
the
balanced
hop
presence
perfect
abv
to
knock
down
one
after
the
other
and
light
enough
to
not
stick
to
the
palette
too
much
maybe
not
extroardinary
but
close
phinn
matts
pours
a
deep
gold
borderline
orange
and
just
a
little
cloudy
there
was
a
finger
width
white
head
that
dissolved
quickly
but
did
leave
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
fresh
and
clean
it
is
hoppy
with
a
grapefruit
bitterness
that
contributes
to
its
crisp
finish
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
appearance
is
a
little
on
the
transparent
side
but
thats
okay
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
hints
of
toffee
the
flavor
is
a
little
bitter
and
definitely
hoppy
not
too
complex
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
too
carbonated
for
me
not
bad
but
not
to
my
fancy
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
ill
pass
next
time
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
hoppier
than
most
apas
also
slightly
sweeter
to
balance
out
the
extra
hops
this
beer
poured
a
clear
light
amber
coloar
and
formed
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbation
is
present
an
aroma
of
cascade
hops
and
malt
with
some
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
a
hint
of
pine
the
body
was
medium
light
with
a
slightly
astrigent
yet
sweet
finish
not
a
bad
pale
ale
style
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth

department
easy
drinking
and
would
be
a
good
brew
for
a
cook
out
or
a
get
together
with
friends
especially
those
who
are
macro
drinkers
overall
this
is
a
watered
down
hot
summer
day
variation
of
a
sam
adams
lager
watery
and
simple
yet
good
flavors
ordinary
in
an
extraordinary
way
medium
bodycreamy
has
a
light
feel
to
it
extremely
drinkable
the
lack
of
malt
makes
it
a
bit
lightthe
great
hoppy
tastes
makes
it
hard
to
stop
drinking
would
be
a
good
summer
beervery
sessionable
get
it
a
try
if
you
like
hoppy
beers
d
middle
of
the
road
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
the
springsummer
months
and
comparing
it
to
these
notes
draft
at
kclingers
tavern
hanover
pa
this
beer
presented
itself
in
the
image
of
a
textbook
amber
beer
with
a
thin
sticky
top
but
it
is
well
hopped
oily
resiny
piney
and
extremely
vicscuous

how
can
you
not
enjoy
this
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
mild
citrus
aromas
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
delightful
beers
i
have
ever
experienced
i
was
able
to
expose
one
of
my
noncraft
beer
drinking
friends
to
this
beer
and
they
loved
it
this
beer
proves
that
its
the
most
extraordinary
beer
out
there

and
all
can
enjoy
this
delicious
brew
one
of
these
days
i
plan
on
visiting
southern
tier
and
while
there
i
will
surely
congratulate
them
on
this
fine
ale
d
a
great
overall
apa
hoppy
deliciousness
and
what
would
be
looked
for
in
an
alcohol
and
hop
amplified
ipa
overall
this
is
a
soso
apa
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
but
the
flavors
are
just
too
subdued
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
with
good
lacing
aromas
are
pleasantly
hoppy
with
some
mild
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
hoppy
but
balanced
by
the
malt
flavor
and
semitangy
sweetness
it
isnt
extraordinary
but
is
certainly
worth
a
go
i
found
this
to
be
an
all
around
good
brew
and
something
i
would
session
most
definitely
a
nice
pale
ale
with
a
nice
cascade
hop
flavor
definitely
more
hoppy
than
most
apas
but
without
losing
balance
the
apa
for
hopheads
overallnot
a
bad
selection
to
try
from
jlmjl
of
the
beer
club
the
mettalic
taste
and
watery
consistency
hold
this
beer
back
from
being
really
good
i
would
take
stoudts
apa
or
snpa
before
this
d
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
hop
complexity
with
a
supporting
flavor
of
soft
malt
with
a
nice
subtlety
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
slight
taste
of
corriander
but
hoppy
not
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
though
very
light
foamy
head
that
dissapears
quickly
very
attractive
copper
color
that
sets
the
tone
for
the
beer
pleasing
drinkability
where
you
can
drink
a
few
and
not
feel
full
recommended
for
the
beer
drinker
that
likes
slightly
hoppy
beer
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
unless
youre
sampling
it
right
after
their
infinitely
tastier
ipa
as
i
am
which
probably
makes
this
seem
weaker
and
plainer
than
it
actually
is
drinkable
but
lacking
passion
definitely
go
ith
the
ipa
if
given
a
choice
good
beer
thanks
to
the
mchugh
family
for
this
one
brew
pours
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
medium
sized
off
white
head
that
beaks
down
pretty
quickly
but
does
leave
a
thick
layer
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
it
has
a
very
enticing
aroma
strong
citrus
hops
and
a
solid
biscuit
like
malt
scent
the
taste
is
very
nice
as
well
notice
the
hops
up
front
but
also
a
very
solid
biscuit
malt
flavor
more
noticeable
than
in
the
aroma
also
has
a
nice
dry
feel
to
it
this
is
a
very
good
brew
to
me
has
a
lot
of
character
both
in
its
scent
and
taste
with
its
lower
abv
it
is
a
good
session
brew
for
me
a
very
tasty
flagship
offering
from
southern
tier
d
looking
for
a
quick
hop
fix
in
a
lighter
bodied
beer
this
is
good
but
not
much
of
that
balance
i
seek
in
an
american
pale
once
again
i
have
not
been
let
down
by
the
boys
in
new
york
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
had
a
great
hop
aroma
couldnt
pick
out
what
specific
kinds
definelty
used
more
than
one
to
get
a
really
complex
smell
great
taste
little
piney
but
not
to
much
would
definetly
want
to
try
again
overall
a
very
quaffable
apa
just
a
good
all
around
beer
very
solid
i
could
easily
drink
a
full
six
pack
of
this
it
has
the
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
malt
and
a
very
enjoyable
slightly
sweet
flavor
wellbalanced
might
be
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
not
a
bad
brew
easy
enough
to
drink
overall
a
nice
drinkable
session
ale
thats
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
average
pale
ale
dnice
and
smooth
with
balanced
flavors
make
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
nothing
more
than
a
little
better
than
average
pours
an
attractive
deep
gold
nice
white
head
aroma
is
enticing
brimming
with
fresh
citrusy
hop
notes
the
flavor
does
not
live
up
to
the
promising
aroma
however
it
tastes
weak
and
anemic
with
some
citrusy
hops
but
not
much
malt
to
back
them
up
reminiscent
of
vitamin
c
tablets
crushed
in
water
perhaps
i
was
being
suggestible
because
i
found
the
body
to
be
thin
with
a
faintly
grainy
rough
texture
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
disappointed
id
like
to
retry
this
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bum
keg
of
their
other
brews
much
more
than
this
one
hazyish
golden
peach
with
meager
white
froth
head
has
little
staying
power
very
mild
citric
aromas
lemon
grapefruit
and
scents
of
turbinado
laced
with
iron
biscuit
notes
emerge
in
the
flavor
unannounced
as
they
are
by
the
aroma
and
are
joined
by
some
offkey
bitterness
that
is
at
first
grapefruit
pith
and
then
mostly
dull
earthy
and
mineral
medium
carbonation
mediumlight
body
lessthanlively
mouthfeel
pales
no
pun
intended
in
comparison
to
other
offerings
from
southern
tier
as
im
certain
im
not
the
first
to
proclaim
phin
and
matt
developed
a
decidedly
unextraordinary
ale
here
decent
but
definitely
not
noteworthy
cheers
d
decent
session
beer
really
i
wouldnt
call
it
extraordinary
but
its
a
satisfying
apa
i
always
found
apas
really
boring
but
a
few
recent
ones
have
gotten
me
to
change
my
mind
a
bit
a
nice
beer
body
is
between
light
and
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
clean
texture
very
easy
to
drink
okay
i
was
about
ready
to
write
these
guys
off
id
tried
a
couple
of
their
brews
and
was
less
than
impressed
then
i
tried
phin
matts
and
my
opinion
of
the
brewery
has
been
changed
this
ale
is
rich
but
smooth
and
easy
on
the
finish
classic
apa
tastes
and
aromas
however
not
quite
as
big
as
some
of
the
others
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
but
with
the
easy
finish
i
could
see
pounding
down
a
sixer
of
these
no
problem
slàinte
i
can
drink
a
truckload
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
respectable
apa
and
among
the
best
of
those
ive
had
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
imagine
this
stuff
is
amazing
on
tap
reccomended
the
mouth
is
dry
with
some
sharp
carbonation
very
drinkable
yet
not
very
extraordinary
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
dense
one
finger
head
good
retention
and
spiderweb
lacing
hoppy
nose
like
cascade
with
faint
toasted
malt
aromas
sweet
toasted
munich
malt
upfront
followed
by
floral
and
citrus
hop
flavor
tame
acidity
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
hint
of
spicy
saaz
the
malt
is
indistinct
but
the
hop
flavor
is
showcased
to
provide
a
good
balance
lightmedium
body
and
even
carbonation
counteract
a
mild
slickness
that
would
otherwise
compliment
this
style
finishes
semidry
with
a
lingering
noble
hop
spice
and
cascade
fruitness
a
nice
american
pale
but
probably
not
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
hoppy
nose
starts
as
hoppysome
malt
but
midway
the
hops
kick
in
to
the
finish
still
a
drinkable
pale

comments
i
liked
this
apa
i
would
recommend
it
to
all
very
tasty
full
flavored
without
being
overly
bitter
only
detraction
is
that
i
find
many
of
southern
tiers
beers
to
have
the
same
hop
flavor
they
should
mix
up
the
hop
bill
well
rounded
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
went
down
easy
and
i
wish
i
had
another
easily
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
southern
tier
once
again
outdoes
their
shoddy
labels
d
not
half
bad
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
an
easy
drinking
pale
with
an
american
hop
flare
certainly
worth
a
try
though
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
very
sessionable
extraordinary
maybe
not
but
quite
tasty
nonetheless
southern
tier
should
rename
their
brewery
top
tier
since
thats
where
i
think
they
reside
when
it
comes
to
the
best
microbreweries
in
american
ive
never
had
a
st
beer
that
was
anything
less
than
delicious
and
phin
matts
extraordinary
ale
does
nothing
to
convince
me
otherwise
it
may
not
be
extraordinary
but
its
a
damn
fine
apa
that
id
love
to
have
access
to
thanks
calico
frankly
i
was
not
expecting
much
here
but
this
is
a
superior
american
pale
ale
very
much
worth
seeking
out
very
enjoyable
beer
my
brother
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
from
upstate
ny
and
i
had
one
on
easter
sunday
after
dinner
it
is
a
mediumdark
gold
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
alcohol
and
orange
the
taste
is
strong
with
the
orange
kicking
in
as
part
of
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
just
a
bit
of
a
kick
this
would
be
great
to
have
on
a
spring
or
summer
day
notes
not
a
bad
beer
very
good
and
a
nice
break
from
the
hopped
up
pale
ales
that
seem
to
be
the
trend
mouthfeel
is
about
right
mediumlight
drinkability
is
pretty
good
all
in
all
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
apa
decent
pours
a
golden
blonde
with
a
clear
bubbly
body
that
leaves
a
1in
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
strong
hops
lemon
honey
and
a
chalky
sweet
tarts
feel
the
taste
is
balanced
starts
floural
hoppy
with
a
slight
herbal
tea
sweetness
there
is
a
lemon
honey
presence
that
has
a
natural
honeycomb
taste
the
floural
hop
presence
is
great
very
different
and
the
finishes
is
smooth
with
a
soft
creamy
feel
on
the
throat
traditional
and
wellmade
arent
insults
i
like
this
beer
and
i
think
you
will
too
just
set
your
expectations
for
anyone
new
to
the
style
this
would
be
a
good
starting
point
pretty
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
pleasant
surprize
this
usually
is
not
my
style
i
bought
it
as
a
single
just
to
try
i
dont
know
about
extraordinary
but
i
find
im
liking
it
very
much
not
much
of
a
head
when
i
poured
this
the
small
head
faded
quickly
to
a
line
of
lace
around
the
edge
smell
is
fruity
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
color
is
a
deep
golden
orange
color
with
minimal
carbonation
the
fruitiness
carries
through
in
the
taste
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
the
hops
are
pretty
aggressive
for
an
apa
and
give
a
grapefruit
like
bitterness
to
the
brew
which
grows
a
bit
tiresome
after
a
while
i
also
detected
a
very
slight
metallic
flavor
in
the
finish
really
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
extraordinary
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
spiciness
lingers
probably
should
be
pared
with
cheese
or
chips
to
lessen
the
effects
not
as
aggressively
hopped
as
the
ipa
they
make
and
it
makes
this
one
more
drinkable
of
the
two
i
wouold
rather
have
this
one
to
hang
out
with
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
if
i
come
across
it
extraordinary
well
that
is
a
bit
much
but
this
is
a
solid
apa
benjamin
franklin
wow
it
smells
so
different
i
mean
it
has
caramel
malt
and
some
hops
like
most
other
pale
ales
but
i
was
told
it
was
difefrent
so
i
feel
like
it
smells
different
well
here
is
something
different
most
apas
have
some
semblance
of
a
head
and
this
one
doesnt
at
all
just
a
light
orangeyellow
color
and
a
wisp
of
white
film
on
top
fore
is
pretty
nice
lots
of
a
caramel
malt
with
a
little
tinge
of
citrus
kissed
hops
toward
the
back
end
its
fairly
tasty
but
not
at
all
different
d
unfortunately
this
extraordinary
ale
is
only
ordinary
nothing
about
this
beer
is
bad
but
nothing
really
does
it
for
me
either
there
are
too
many
other
good
apas
out
there
to
drink
this
again
a
clean
amber
beer
with
orange
highlights
has
a
small
foamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
at
first
has
a
floral
hop
character
then
a
piney
hoppiness
takes
over
as
the
beer
warms
a
smooth
malt
note
comes
out
of
the
background
there
is
a
light
sweet
malt
note
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
followed
by
a
nice
easy
tea
like
bitterness
with
a
grapfruit
finish
a
different
pale
ale
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
drinkable
balanced
somewhat
complex
and
interesting
but
somehow
still
smooth
brew
definetely
one
though
hard
to
find
at
least
where
i
am
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
an
easily
consumed
brew
i
really
liked
it

of
the
noncomplexity

a
good

d

just
enough
for

go
get
some

this
is
not

bitterness
seemed

this
is
an

but
too
thin

enjoyed
this
very
much
and
will
buy
again
uf
nice
pale
ale
that
almost
borders
on
an
ipa
from
southern
tier
i
still
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
mouthfeel
is
easy
and
light
and
this
is
highly
drinkable
not
my
favorite
apa
ever
but
an
easy
drinking
beer
perhaps
not
reeeally
extraordinary
but
not
ordinary
had
this
from
the
bottle
pours
a
mid
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
this
beer
smells
of
hops
and
citris
the
citris
comes
though
in
the
taste
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
not
a
bad
one
after
thinking
a
while
it
has
a
grapefruit
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
light
carbonation
a
drinkable
beer
indeed
drinkability
is
great
cannot
complain
at
all
these
ones
go
down
smooth
and
fast
one
of
the
better
american
apas
ive
sampled
but
it
could
very
well
be
called
an
ipa
this
one
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
in
my
region
many
thanks
to
my
fellow
ba
for
supplying
this
magnificent
ale
extraordinary
maybe
not
or
maybe
im
too
jaded
but
if
its
not
extraordinary
its
certainly
well
above
average
enjoy
woahh
delicious
i
had
this
on
tap
at
mcgregors
perinton
a
glorious
20
ouncer
this
came
to
me
with
barely
any
head
but
looked
great
a
nice
golden
orange
color
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
very
citrusy
and
hoppy
this
smelled
and
tasted
a
lot
more
mild
than
the
other
southern
tier
offerings
and
i
love
the
stronger
ones
but
this
is
a
great
idea
it
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
but
still
has
a
great
amount
of
flavor
via
floral
hops
and
citrus
flavors
you
just
arent
bombarded
with
pine
trees
this
time
around
it
is
nice
and
malty
too
a
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
sorta
crisp
but
soft
at
the
same
time
drinkability
is
high
this
beer
could
make
a
good
introduction
to
the
hops
for
a
macro
drinker
its
not
a
slap
you
in
the
face
with
hops
beer
but
the
hops
definitely
make
their
presence
known
very
ok
beer
but
nothing
more
to
me
near
crystal
orangered
pour
with
a
very
thin
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
hops
and
some
sort
of
fruit
are
the
clear
nose
winners
about
the
same
on
the
tongue
at
first
giving
way
to
decent
malting
a
good
summer
beer
for
certain
and
i
suspect
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
if
it
were
better
chilled
and
i
was
outdoors
i
will
revisit
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
brew
is
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
its
a
little
haze
too
its
got
an
intense
grapefruit
hop
aroma
floral
resiny
citric
hops
dominate
the
nose
theres
a
little
sweetness
up
front
and
a
nice
rounded
maltiness
throughout
this
is
a
pretty
well
balanced
brew
tipped
just
slightly
on
the
hoppy
side
of
things
finishes
with
a
solid
hoppinesspine
and
citrus
id
like
this
as
a
session
brew

but
i
cant

the

taste
is

a

apricot

body
and
mildly
carbonated
nice
easy
drinking
apa
well
done
to
get
the
hop
flavor
without
an
overbearing
hop
bitter
though
this
beer
is
complex
and
intriguing
it
doesnt
leave
me
in
the
mood
to
have
another
so
this
isnt
an
everday
drinking
beer
more
a
quality
novelty
poured
out
a
dark
lemon
color
with
a
thin
head
which
stayed
a
while
smell
consisted
of
strong
juicy
citrusy
hops
with
little
malts
in
the
background
taste
started
out
with
a
shot
of
malts
with
the
hops
taking
over
in
the
middle
and
in
the
end
very
citrusy
with
grapefruit
flavors
showing
the
most
strength
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
some
good
carbonation
overall
it
was
decent
just
nothing
mind
blowing
i
have
to
begin
by
remarking
on
the
head
which
was
thick
with
a
lemonyellow
color
that
reminded
me
of
weis
markets
lemon
chiffon
ice
cream
from
when
i
was
a
kid
there
was
a
zesty
hoppiness
on
the
nose
the
beer
was
a
crystalclear
golden
color
it
had
a
light
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
an
overt
sweetness
both
on
the
palate
and
at
the
finish
to
offset
the
hoppiness
i
found
it
very
refreshing
for
a
muggy
summer
day
while
sitting
on
the
second
floor
back
balcony
a
definite
candidate
for
a
session
beer
taste
is
tangerine
grapefruity
hops
surrounded
by
more
berry
and
earthy
sweetnesses
tea
leaves
are
brought
to
mind
light
overall
super
drinkable
and
puts
the
ipa
to
shame
especially
when
tasted
sidetoside
carbonation
tingles
my
mouth
and
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
for
some
variety
against
the
summer
tone
adds
substance
and
aftertaste
which
quickly
dissipates
to
encourage
further
sippage
about
as
close
to
an
a
for
summer
as
you
can
get
very
good
balance
of
taste
between
maltiness
hops
and
some
fruitiness
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
terribly
heavy
which
is
unusual
for
a
dark
ale
but
makes
drinkability
even
better
mouthfeel
is
good
depite
this
this
is
one
of
the
only
available
craft

around
here

im
up

too
in
short
ipa
flavor
in
a
pale
ale
saw
that
this
was
on
tap
at
the
jersey
city
barcade
and
i
had
to
go
try
it
out
i
have
had
bottles
of
this
before
and
very
much
enjoyed
them
given
the
conceit
of
this
beer
i
figured
having
it
on
tap
was
necessary
rich
citrus
hoppy
flavors
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
like
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
might
be
fun
to
try
i
really
like
this
stuff
o
a
sessionable
pale
ale
not
the
most
complex
flavor
but
enjoyable
o
great
beer
will
have
again
2nd
time
ive
had
it
in
bottle
and
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
live
15
minutes
from
southern
tier
brewing
company
so
its
always
nice
to
pick
up
a
keg
right
from
the
place
in
which
the
beer
was
brewed
more
times
then
not
im
drinking
this
beer
fresh
so
my
review
might
be
bias
great
apa
with
citrus
notes
of
grapefruit
and
apricot
taking
over
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
taste
of
the
beer
mildly
hoppy
reminds
me
of
founders
all
day
ipa
in
taste
once
in
awhile
i
will
notice
inconsistency
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
from
batch
to
batch
but
this
is
a
great
summertime
beer
one
i
usually
have
on
tap
and
one
ive
been
enjoying
since
i
had
stbcs
trial
run
of
this
stuff
a
few
years
back
poured
cloudy
smells
of
hops
and
citrus
which
was
a
nice
surprise
from
a
pale
ale
however
wheres
the
hop
taste
it
just
struck
me
as
funny
with
a
big
hop
nose
and
a
little
hop
taste
but
whatever
regardless
its
still
very
good
i
wouldnt
recommend
a
little
hoppy
and
citrusy
in
the
nose
clean
taste
some
nice
lacing
head
fades
love
this
beer
was
able
to
enjoy
this
one
while
watching
the
game
with
friends
was
very
impressed
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
a
funky
fruit
like
aroma
and
taste
maybe
citrus
just
tasted
very
off
to
me
not
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
southern
tier
nice
and
crisp
quite
hoppy
and
carbonated
for
a
pale
ale
thin
and
light
nonetheless
delicious
nose
no
award
winner
yet
exceeded
expectations
had
it
on
draft
live
beasts
didnt
seem
to
impart
much
a
very
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
thin
but
lasting
head
smells
of
lemoncitrus
fairly
typical
pale
ale
with
good
hop
features
mild
bitter
that
lingered
a
bit
too
long
for
my
likinga
fairly
standard
and
very
drinkable
if
you
prefer
this
style
a
nice
dry
pale
ale
that
still
manages
a
fruity
character
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
lives
up
to
southern
tiers
lofty
standards
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
bartender
cant
put
a
head
on
this
beer
to
save
her
life
i
really
like
this
one
its
golden
and
a
little
hazy
but
still
light
enough
looking
in
the
glass
what
makes
it
special
is
its
hop
profile
definitely
new
zealand
varietals
in
here
high
alpha
and
high
oil
fruity
and
tropical
and
almost
smells
like
a
lotion
some
young
hottie
should
wear
its
that
intense
aromatically
the
flavor
shows
the
hops
just
like
the
nose
less
perfume
and
more
grassy
summery
feel
to
it
which
is
welcomed
the
malt
bill
appears
to
contain
some
wheat
and
has
that
sort
of
texture
which
helps
the
hops
last
just
a
little
longer
its
only
a
little
bitter
too
more
tangerine
than
anything
else
in
the
finish
which
lasts
awhile
overall
a
really
really
good
pale
ale
maybe
a
touch
more
body
than
it
needs
but
i
like
it
this
time
of
year
where
the
feel
suits
the
season
but
the
flavor
teases
summer
hard
to
do
that
well
this
is
top
notch
flavorwise
i
hate
to
even
mention
the
word
surprise
but
it
was
a
bit
of
one
for
me
some
of
the
southern
tier
sixpack
offerings
have
been
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
but
it
has
been
quite
some
time
since
ive
consumed
them
the
bright
fruity
hops
are
matched
very
well
by
the
bready
malts
in
the
finish
the
live
yeast
seems
to
give
the
body
a
nice
boost
which
helps
the
flavors
truly
shine
nice
and
drinkable
with
enough
hops
to
keep
me
interested
drinkable
but
boring
too
many
tasty
sessions
out
here
on
the
west
coast
to
look
out
for
this
again
ill
stick
to
sts
tasty
big
beers
nice
crisp
taste
with
a
little
fruit
after
taste
was
mildly
surprised
by
the
beer
served
in
a
glass
from
bar
tap
very
nice
hop
level
for
a
pale
i
think
it
has
a
more
dominant
hop
flavor
than
most
pale
ales
good
everyday
beer
with
very
good
body
consistency
nice
lacing
when
poured
a
very
good
beer
and
when
you
consider
the
cost
it
is
a
good
go
to
but
still
could
not
give
it
an
outstanding
rating
on
tap
at
local
brass
tap
nicely
balanced
would
gladly
drink
again
pours
a
golden

of
pleasant
orange
citrus

a
very

than
a
true

short

very
nice
easy

pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
nice

the
smell
was
full
of
hops
in
the
beginning
but
you
could
also
pick
up
subtle
notes
of
sour
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
toasted
bread
the
taste
was
highly
refreshing
with
crisp
hop
notes
throughout
that
created
a
wonderful
beginning
and
finish
light
but
very
good
overall
refreshing
not
overpowering
opleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
ive
been
underwhelmed
by
this
brewer
previously
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
of
it
while
considering
my
other
options
however
handed
one
or
available
in
pint
form
at
a
bar
would
consistently
make
me
happy
mf
refreshing
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
medbodied
great
upbeat
finish
this
seems
to
be
more
like
an
ipa
lite
rather
than
an
apa
the
bottle
conditioning
is
the
best
part
here
because
it
adds
such
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
with
the
added
carbonation
tone
down
the
hops
and
you
might
be
able
to
find
a
pale
ale
in
there
tasty
beer
the
live
is
just
a
gimmick
they
ought
to
package
this
on
its
own
and
give
it
a
better
brand
name
clear
golden
pour
with
a
white
onefinger

nice

grapefruit

this
is
a
lighter
refreshing
style
i
dont
visit
too
often
great
after
the
lawncut
o
in
all
fairness
pale
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
sessionable
if
you
really
enjoy
the
style
it
is
worth
a
try
its
interesting
how
tame
this
beer
is
for
southern
tier
a
brewery
notorious
for
going
over
the
top
with
sweetness
flavors
abv
and
just
about
anything
everything
else
overall
a
decent
and
neutral
apa
poured
from
bottle
into
a
glass
hazy
golden
color
with
nice
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
nice
lace
light
and
drinkable
subtle
grapefruit
notes
followed
by
nicely
balanced
hop
profile
very
sessionable
bottleconditioning
leaves
natural
sediment
in
bottom
while
bottle
conditioned
is
far
from
rare
this
one
seemed
to
take
that
moniker
very
seriously
i
havent
had
a
bottle
open
so
violently
from
co2
andor
bubble
up
for
a
few
seconds
after
pouring
this
pale
ale
might
have
the
foamiest
head
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
from
a
bottle
a
23
off
white
fluffy
head
on
every
bottle
i
poured
there
is
the
offputting
to
me
residue
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
otherwise
the
appearance
is
solid
hints
of
grapefruit
floral
hops
and
yeast
in
the
smell
very
nice
hops
and
citrus
overtones
are
the
highlights
of
the
taste
easy
to
drink
not
too
astringent
which
sometimes
apas
can
be
overall
very
solid
choice
for
a
summer
apa
great
balance
enough
to
satisfy
the
hop
tongue
and
crisp
enough
to
session
this
is
spring
and
summer
in
one
no
need
to
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
light
ipa
style
brews
the
live
yeast
gives
extra
shelf
life
however
being
close
to
the
brewery
thats
not
an
issue
here
ive
heard
of
at
home
kegs
getting
weak
toward
the
end
but
never
had
issue
in
bars
the
cloudier
the
better
with
this
brew
in
my
experience
with
this
beer
if
u
get
crystal
clear
live
you
have
not
recieved
the
best
southern
tier
has
to
offer
however
if
your
live
is
all
muddy
u
have
the
best
beer
offering
the
beer
gods
can
deliver
have
yet
to
determine
what
makes
this
beer
so
muddy
and
great
wether
it
is
early
runs
or
later
ones
or
if
sitting
for
awhile
helps
if
you
discover
the
secret
let
me
in
o
great
drinkability
an
apa
that
could
be
easily
classified
as
an
ipa
quite
hoppy
refreshing
and
delicious
had
on
tap
at
isaac
newtons
in
newtown
pa
served
in
a
pint
glass
yellowish
amber
color
closest
pale
ale
ive
had
to
an
ipa
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
i
find
this
as
a
good
beer
for
those
who
arent
in
the
mood
for
all
the
bitterness
of
a
full
ipa
overall
a
well
hopped
pale
ale
yet
balanced
by
slight
malt
and
grassy
character
very
refreshing
and
sure
to
please
during
the
warmer
months
i
find
myself
drinking
more
ipas
and
doubles
nowadays
but
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
i
will
consider
this
as
a
sessionable
hoppy
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
two
finger
head
smells
yeasty
and
citrusy
and
very
bright
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
grapefruit
like
beer
some
pine
like
flavor
a
very
nice
clean
and
refreshing
beer
has
good
flavor
and
good
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
masked
this
beer
somehow
ends
up
being
a
totally
decent
beer
overall
for
what
it
is
its
still
a
relatively
pleasing
beer
golden
hued
with
excellent
clarity
vibrant
carbonation
is
evident
with
the
inch
thick
rocky
white
head
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
pale
biscuity
malt
and
a
blend
of
hops
is
judiciously
used
the
feel
is
very
lightsmoothand
drinkable
theres
the
nice
blend
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
on
the
front
of
the
palate
i
get
biscuity
pale
malt
following
shortly
thereafter
the
fade
is
rather
abrupt

d
this
started
out
so
strong
but
failed
to
pull
it
off

the

pours
clear
yellow
gold
color
with
a
huge
foamy
2
finger
white
head
that
was
full
of
small
bubbles
and
faded
very
slowly
leaving
good
lacing
as
it
dissipated
smells
of
lemon
zest
citrus
malt
springlike
hoppy
notes
grains
and
light
caramel
nice
balance
and
appropriate
for
the
style
tastes
like
it
smells
but
with
more
citrus
and
piney
hop
notes
to
go
along
with
the
lemon
zest
malt
herbs
grass
light
bready
grains
and
caramel
very
has
nice
balance
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
that
makes
it
very
easy
drinking
i
drank
2
of
these
quickly
as
they
felt
nice
and
light
with
average
to
mild
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
very
good
drinkability
aftertaste
was
clean
and
near
crisp
this
was
a
definite
session
beer
and
one
id
like
to
try
from
a
bottle
a
solid
brew
the
taste
is
good
with
slight
pine
tinge
from
the
hops
with
light
citrus
and
slight
astringent
flavor
like
overbrewed
tea
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
which
adds
sweetness
to
balance
the
slight
bitter
aspect
the
taste
of
malt
is
pretty
well
interwoven
with
the
hops
and
yeast
as
a
pale
should
be
overall
this
is
a
nicely
flavored
pale
not
very
complex
or
intense
but
it
is
good
for
the
style
o
scores
range
from
a
4
to
a
5
on
this
one
have
to
say
it
is
an
excellent
summer
choice
refreshing
playful
light
an
outstanding
beer
that
would
be
welcome
at
bbqs
and
picnics
right
now
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
just
hits
me
perfectly
this
beer
is
not
the
strongest
hoppiest
etc
but
it
is
just
a
nice
solid
beer
especially
as
the
weather
warms
up
having
one
of
these
beers
after
a
nice
day
outside
in
the
sun
can
really
hit
the
spot

pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
slight
amber
cast
when
decanted
massive
well
formed
head
with
superb
lacing
nice
nose
of
citrus
against
a
slightly
sweet
background
very
light
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
the
flavor
profile
is
a
mild
grapefruit
citrus
focused
bitterness
against
a
biscuit
background
a
very
slight
spruce
note
is
also
present
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
lingering
grapefruit
flavored
light
bitterness
a
good
session
ale
i
drank
this
right
on
the
heels
of
sixpoint
resin
and
hires
with
pretzels
in
between
of
course
what
a
relief
im
really
enjoying
this
my
third
southern
tier
pale
ale
ipa
and
2xipa
very
very
balanced
floral
hoppyness
with
enough
bitter
to
add
character
but
not
to
overwhelm
the
perfect
session
beer
a
very
easy
drinking
apa
smooth
balanced
hoppy
liquid
gold
would
easily
buy
again
cheers
very
subtle
hop
aroma
and
smell
pleasantly
surprising
how
much
the
malt
comes
out
in
the
nose
i
would
have
to
agree
with
st
and
say
it
was
a
light
copper
almost
golden
or
blonde
very
clear
slightly
carbonated
not
undercarbd
a
fair
bit
of
sediment
settled
in
the
glass
st
says
there
is
a
hop
dominated
flavor
which
i
dont
get
the
taste
feels
very
balanced
to
me
for
a
pale
ale
the
finish
is
where
i
get
the
most
hop
bitterness
its
slightly
sweet
but
very
well
rounded
with
the
malts
and
hops
a
lot
of
citrus
and
pine
slightly
fruity
mouthfeel
is
light
and
with
a
5
5
abv
very
much
drinkable
and
feels
session
worthy
the
taste
is
more
sweet
than
many
ipas
but
there
is
a
kind
of
juicy
watermelon
note
on
it
as
well
which
i
did
not
expect
the
fruity
character
tends
to
take
it
all
over
moderate
bitter
finale
o
a
very
raw
and
powerful
hopcentric
pale
ale
that
uses
citra
quite
obviously
as
its
focal
point
a
little
bit
of
rough
yeast
character
adds
to
the
raw
feel
of
it
too
more
of
a
shock
and
awe
approach
from
southern
tier
as
they
normally
make
very
clean
and
focused
beers
its
punishing
in
a
good
way
if
youre
a
hop
head
and
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
it
draws
some
comparisons
to
zombie
dust
in
the
way
it
wields
the
citra
hop
a
great
buy
at
its
price
point
and
availability
and
the
concert
ticket
marketing
really
works
for
it
great
concept
great
execution
o
id
love
to
try
this
even
fresher
but
its
nice
as
is
delicious
the
smell
and
taste
is
perfect
exactly
what
i
love
about
hoppy
beers
the
grapefruit
and
citrus
through
and
through
thats
the
theme
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
the
taste
seems
more
akin
to
the
ipa
than
just
the
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
this
again
live
pours
a
cloudy
bronze
color
with
a
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
fruity
and
floral
aroma
nice
and
hoppy
the
taste
has
a
bold
hoppy
flavor
nothing
else
to
take
away
from
the
hops
very
full
flavors
and
strong
body
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
beer
good
hop
flavors
slightly
hazy
medium
gold
color
with
lots
of
floaties
in
the
glass
and
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
on
top
aromas
of
lemon
and
grapefruity
citrus
with
bits
of
pine
resin
and
a
light
bready
crackery
malt
to
back
it
up
the
flavor
is
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
a
fair
amount
of
citrusy
hop
flavor
light
level
of
hop
bitterness
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
bubbly
mouthfeel
decent
pale
ale
certainly
quaffable
but
for
the
price
id
buy
something
different
next
time
o
a
bitter
hop
forward
pale
ale
at
5
5
abv
is
a
year
round
winner
very
good
apa
tasty
with
good
citrus
complexity
and
still
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
apa
hoppier
than
standard
for
the
style
but
whats
not
to
like
about
hops
would
gladly
get
again
overall
just
a
touch
of
cornadjunct
flavour
is
what
keeps
this
beer
from
being
truly
great
still
a
very
good
beer
that
is
well
worth
picking
up
overall
a
great
tasting
pale
ale
with
some
nice
flavor
features
d
a
rather
pedestrian
american
pale
ale
that
has
a
tad
more
hop
bite
than
most
nothing
remarkable
nor
nothing
off
putting
i
absolutely
love
the
label
which
is
a
collage
of
random
used
concert
ticket
stubs
a
decent
enough
brew
that
i
would
gladly
indulge
again
if
provide
the
opportunity
but
im
not
sure
i
would
invest
in
a
sixpack
or
case
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
yellow
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
unremarkable
with
a
light
hop
smell
if
u
try
and
find
it
the
taste
is
plain
and
really
nothing
good
or
bad
in
either
direction
not
all
that
impressed
a
very
plain
apa
that
i
really
have
no
desire
to
have
again
i
would
pick
this
up
again
in
comparison
not
nearly
as
accomplished
as
hop
devil
that
ive
had
recently
but
a
very
good
find
beer
is
mediumlight
to
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
at
first
fizzy
gradually
tapering
to
a
foamy
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
for
the
beer
and
the
fizziness
is
not
entirely
pleasurable
o
not
a
bad
tasting
pale
ale
a
solid
taste
is
brought
down
by
a
lack
of
oomph

theportersorter
this
is
a
really
nice
pale
ale
southern
tier
has
a
nice
beer
on
their
hands
with
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
an
incredible
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
killer
citrus
hop
nose
totally
surpassed
my
expectations
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
with
an
excellent
hop
character
it
has
a
mild
bitterness
but
finishes
with
a
great
hoppy
freshness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
good
apa
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
cloudy
glowing
golden
color
with
a
mighty
frothy
head
that
retains
nicely
classic
pale
ale
aroma
lots
of
juicy
zesty
citrus
floral
and
grassy
hops
fresh
crackerlike
malts
and
pine
grapefruity
fresh
hoppy
flavor
oily
juicy
leafy
and
spicy
with
a
little
sweetness
from
the
malt
slick
and
fluffy
feeling
in
the
mouth
not
highly
carbonated
excellent
apa
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
orange
color
with
thin
white
head
on
top
the
retention
settles
into
some
clumps
of
bubbles
on
top
the
lacing
is
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
there
is
a
subtle
hop
aroma
coming
off
of
this
one
but
not
much
at
all
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
pilsner
at
first
slightly
grassy
and
earthy
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
grainy
earthy
malt
very
typical
of
a
pale
ale
the
bitterness
is
low
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
then
it
dries
out
quickly
overall
its
a
decent
brew
not
my
favorite
from
southern
tier
but
it
was
nice
to
try
o
a
tasty
apa
thats
worth
a
try
d
oddly
sugary
for
the
style
but
it
has
a
nice
hop
character
and
remains
relatively
drinkable
despite
the
sweetness
solid
pale
ale
one
that
id
go
for
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
372013
pours
hazy
and
cloudy
pale
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
and
fluffy
white
head
with
incredible
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lasts
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
huge
grapefruit
orange
zest
orange
pith
lemon
zest
pineapple
tangerine
floral
grass
light
pine
light
honey
and
floral
earthiness
incredible
aromas
with
great

and

big
strength

on
the
finish
for
a
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
citrus
hop
flavors
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
and
zero
cloying
flavors
present
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
a
very
smooth
crisp
and
lightly
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
pale
ale
great
balance
and
complexity
of
citrus
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
i
love
a
good
apa
but
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
great
new
packaged
one
southern
tier
just
started
bottling
live
so
i
hope
it
stands
up
the
appearance
at
the
very
least
does
live
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
head
the
aroma
is
briskly
hoppy
providing
sharp
citrus
over
light
caramel
malts
and
grains
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
clean
with
the
sharp
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
cutting
over
grainy
malts
to
a
very
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
live
is
a
solid
apa
it
falls
to
the
ageold
problem
with
apas
though
where
a
sixpack
costs
almost
as
much
as
a
twelver
of
sierra
nevada
and
its
not
really
better
than
snpa
overall
i
always
try
anything
these
guys
put
out
and
i
could
see
picking
up
a
case
of
this
a
very
drinkable
hoppy
pale
ale
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
straightforward
and
easy
to
like
beer
drinkable
edit
having
this
multiple
times
including
on
tap
this
beer
is
just
stupid
good
for
and
apa
unbelievably
refreshing
flavorful
and
definitely
sessionable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
will
buy
throughout
the
springsummer
season
great
job
southern

curious
about
this
one
pours
a
nice
thick
head
light
colored
in
my
shaker
pint
glass
smells
terrific
citrus
hops
tastes
the
same
big
favors
almost
an
ipa
really
this
is
basically
a
delicious
session
able
ipa
ill
enjoy
many
more
of
these
this
summer
dig
southern
tier
overall
great
beer
good
purchase
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
golden
with
a
lasting
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
malt
its
a
fairly
clean
smelling
beer
the
taste
follows
the
nose
mostly
i
get
the
citrus
though
its
mostly
orange
as
well
as
some
lemon
i
also
get
the
light
breadiness
from
the
malt
theres
some
back
end
biterness
that
is
fairly
mild
its
a
bit
like
some
bitter
orange
on
the
back
end
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
strong
carbonation
the
beer
drinks
very
smoothly
due
to
all
the
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
o
not
overwhelmingly
complex
but
definitely
very
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
this
will
be
perfect
in
the
summer
already
planning
on
a
six
pack
one
of
stbcs
better
offerings
nice
job
this
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
apa
that
has
tremendous
drinkability
this
is
a
sessionable
ale
with
enough
hop
character
to
keep
you
interested
through
several
bottles
i
would
like
to
keep
some
of
this
on
hand
for
my
new
any
occasion
beer
spot
on
for
the
new
breed
of
american
pale
ales
o
overall
this
was
just
plain
enjoyable
nothing
stood
out
that
made
it
spectacular
but
thats
what
i
like
about
it
adequate
flavor
without
being
overdone
another
nice
beer
from
st
with
great
flavor
and
aromas
which
are
fresh
and
distinct
poured
into
a
nonic

clear
lighter
dull

real
big
but
pleasant

wise
herbal
notes
along
with
a
tinge
of

the
palatea
little
tea
and
mint
is
noticablea
firm
lightly
sweet
nutty
biscuit
base
holds
up
to
the
hops
this
a
nice
apa
not
gigantic
hops
but
a
minty
herbal
approach
that
makes
it
really
drinkablethe
maltiness
is
big
enough
for
non
hopheads
to
like
this
beer
as
well
nice
job
here
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
good
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
piney
hops
body
is
light
and
crisp
taste
is
of
grassypiney
hops
with
hints
of
fruit
its
smooth
from
start
to
finish
this
brewery
continues
to
impress
a
must
try
overall
a
very
tasty
new
beer
from
southern
tier
like
to
see
they
are
experimenting
with
live
yeast
in
their
bottles
live
can
live
on
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
a
consistent
hop
influenced
flavor
profile
definitely
is
a
pale
ale
and
doesnt
wander
into
ipa
territory
carbonation
is
a
bit
full
very
easy
to
drink
though
i
am
sure
this
would
be
super
tasty
on
cask
i
also
had
it
on
draft
yesterday
11272013
and
it
had
a
similar
character
but
a
tad
smoother
o
this
is
a
nice
brew
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
there
just
isnt
a
ton
of
flavor
or
feel
to
this
beer
although
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
very
pleasant
a
really
good
pale
ale
similar
to
many
hoppy
southern
tier
offerings
which
i
always
seem
to
enjoy
i
think
i
found
my
easy
drinking
summer
session
beer
o
terrible
i
hope
they
just
changed
their
formula
for
this
because
i
dont
believe
my
tastes
have
changed
i
was
extremely
excited
to
see
this
at
the
store
a
few
days
ago
and
now
im
extremely
pissed
the
bottle
has
a
dob
of
225
too
so
it
couldnt
have
gone
off
i
drank
a
whole
6er
over
the
past
few
days
before
making
this
review
to
confirm
that
it
was
this
bad
and
unfortunately
it
is
i
sent
out
a
few
bombers
to
friends
about
a
month
or
two
ago
and
they
said
it
was
also
very
good
so
again
i
certainly
hope
this
was
just
a
badlypackaged
6er
one
of
southern
tiers
best
hoppy
offerings
only
behind
2xone
and
2xipa
really
this
is
a
mixed
bag
on
the
debit
side
is
the
body
and
appearance
but
the
flavor
and
smell
are
appealing
great
new
product
and
soon
to
hit
6packs
and
cases
great
price
awesome
hop
notes
in
the
nose
perfect
aftertaste
to
the
style
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
hopheads
and
those
looking
for
that
special
apa
it
dances
the
apa
style
line
very
closely
and
does
not
go
into
the
ipa
style
zone
not
to
mention
names
but
this
is
a
serious
contender
to
a
certain
undead
pale
ale
from
the
beer
gods
in
munster
it
has
that
beers
and
others
like
its
spirit
buy
this
beer
when
you
see
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
orange
with
a
fluffy
eggshell
white
head
aroma
of
huge
citrus
notes
ripe
tropical
fruits
this
pale
is
dry
hopped
with
100
citra
and
it
shows
taste
takes
the
beer
in
a
different
direction
tons
of
juicy
lemon
and
grapefruit
bitterness
coats
the
mouth
a
very
slight
sweetness
appears
at
the
back
of
the
palate
to
balance
things
out
a
little
very
dry
finish
sort
of
a
session
ipa
which
is
awesome
this
will
be
a
new
favorite
of
mine
from
st
cant
wait
to
see
this
in
12
oz
bottles
in
the
next
few
weeks

odthis
one
grew
on
me
at
3
70
for
a
bomber
this
is
a
steal
far
better
than
many
of
their
offerings
i
would
take
this
over
their
regular
ipa
everyday
for
the
rest
of
my
existence
so
much
orange
a
superhoppy
pale
ale
that
is
to
me
an
india
pale
ale
whatever
it
is
it
tastes
pretty
delicious
a
duvel
tulip
nice
copper
color
head
is
white
and
lite
and
leaves
just
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
really
nice
lots
of
citra
and
cascade
obviously
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
carbonation
is
right
on
lots
of
it
which
i
like
seems
to
evenly
distribute
flavors
mouth
feel
is
dry
yeast
did
a
great
job
none
of
that
unfermented
sugary
feel
flavor
is
just
what
i
was
hoping
for
relatively
light
ipa
in
terms
of
gravity
5
5
abv
great
hop
combination
if
i
could
get
this
year
round
it
would
be
a
top
pick
overall
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
nice
hops
that
could
come
out
a
bit
more
interesting
malts
that
take
a
background
flavor
and
leave
the
beer
overall
light
and
drinkable
but
also
could
be
a
bit
more
maybe
and
a
unique
yeast
character
that
brings
the
beer
to
life
alright
effervescent
nice
carbonation
and
a
light
almost
earthy
farmhouse
flavor
thats
not
quite
there
a
nice
beer
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
pale
ale
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
nice
wellpriced
pale
ale
no
weird
ingredients
or
other
gimmicks
just
an
wellmade
pale
ale
very
watery
for
an
ale
im
surprised
at
the
amount
of
hops
that
can
come
through
such
a
thinbodied
beer
even
still
it
falls
flat
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
colorado
and
another
excellent
beer
from
left
hand
which
is
fastley
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
colorado
breweries
its
beautifully
balanced
between
bready
malt
sweetness
and
floral
slightly
citrusy
hops
an
excellent
american
pale
ale
finally
found
a
pale
ale
i
like
not
over
hopped
this
beer
had
a
slightly
skunked
odor
and
taste
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
light
flower
y
flavor
coincidentally
not
much
citrus
notes
just
an
average
easy
drinking
ale

good
retention
the
beer
doesnt
have
much
on
the
nose
at
all
it
has
a
very
faint
fragrance
that
matches
the
taste
the
taste
is
well
balanced
for
a
pale
ale
but
lacks
in
strong
flavors
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
hop
presence
but
it
doesnt
do
much
the

of
the
beer
is

when

an
ipa

apa
which

usual
i

my

impression

this
is
that
it
would
make
a
decent
beer
for
having
more
than
one
but
not
the
greatest
for
sitting

just
enjoying
a
complex
beer
since
its
not
overly
complex
o
overall
it
is
nice
it
has
some
good
flavors
but
i
almost
feel
it
is
overshadowed
by
the
bitterness
good
but
not
great
finish
grass
and
a
small

o
i
like
it
for
what
it
is

pretty

a
low
abv
its
refreshing
and
has
a
pleasing
flavor
with
enough
bitterness
in
the

to
keep
me
interested
id
like
to
try
this
sidebyside

from
my
recollection
of
that
taste
i
think
i
like
the
taste
of
this
stranger
better
db
a
interesting
pale
ale
that
drinks
pretty
easily
the
fruit
flavor
is
different
from
almost
any
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
and
refreshes
me
quite
well
worth
a
shot
o
stranger
doesnt
make
a
great
first
impression
but
it
comes
into
its
own
with
biscuity
maltiness
and
floral
hoppiness
solidly
aboveaverage

average
apa
from
the
folks
at

while
this
isnt
going

your
socks
off

assault
a
6er
of
this
would
be
welcome
almost
anywhere
there
are
plenty
of
good
bigbold
pales
in
the
area
and
i
appreciate
how
lh
took
a
different
road
delicately
balanced
but
with
a
lot
of
unique
flavor
to
keep
you
searching
through
the
whole
pint
its
not
one
to
punch
you
in
the
mouth
but
the
craftsmanship
on
this
one
is
pretty
marverlous
to
sum
up
a
decent
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
little
rye
to
set
it
apart
and
you
can
make
dirty
jokes
while
you
drink
it
it
is
always
to
good
to
have
a
bottle
of
ale
you
know
is
fresh
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
it
is
flavorful
and
quaffable
finishes
semidry
with
a
hint
of
citrus
bitterness
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
adequate
carbonation
but
this
is
quite
forgettable
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
let
me
make

the
last
six
of
jackmans
i
had
wouldnt
go
away
im
glad
this
was
at
the
beer
store
this
weekend
all
around
its
considered
an
american
pale
ale
but
its
not
textbook
had
it
on
draft
before
liked
it
alot
better
love
the
name
d
i
wish
i
bought
a
6
pack
for
myself
this
is
a
pretty
basic
beer
however
left
hand
nailed
it
in
terms
of
bottling
a
light
and
tasteful
beer
definitely
worth
the
buy
aside
from
the
label
stating
that
this
is
an
american
pale
ale
it
is
not
as
crisp
or
as
neutral
as
american
pale
ales
should
be
nor
does
stranger
exhibit
the
sharp
and
citrus
bitterness
of
classics
like
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
but
as
an
english
pale
ale
the
beer
fares
well
with
or
without
the
spicy
rye
character
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
so
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
rye
pale
ale
im
not
sure
if
i
could
pull
that
flavor
out
but
overall
this
is
a
nice
fairly
sessionable
pale
ale
the
hops
bring
a
mild
floral
citrus
character
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
barley
has
a
standard
for
the
style
sweet
bready
taste
and
a
touch
of
caramel
check
it
out
for
new
session
ale
excellent
beer
and
totally
drinkable
i
would
like
to
have
this
on
draft
somewhere
soon
drink
and
overall
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
have
to
sacrifice
flavor
very
drinkable
my
first
beer
from
left
hand
not
sure
why
its
taken
me
so
long
but
not
a
good
start
ive
given
up
breweries
before
after
two
disasters
and
that
was
a
mistake
so
ill
give
them
a
few
more
shots
well
see
d
good
for
a
go
but
no
mo
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
going
in
but
this
was
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
style
full
bodied
well
balanced
and
flavorful
making
this
a
pretty
good
sessionable
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
apa
that
fit
in
well
with
the
warm
late
winter
day
i
had
it
on
clear
pale
orange
in
body
with
dissipating
white
head
sweet
aroma
of
lemon
wet
grass
hops
and
slight
bread
in
the
background
a
surprising
hit
on
the
palate
bread
gives
way
to
grass
lemons
sour
fruit
skins
and
window
cleaner
to
finish
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
an
unbalanced
unappetizing
pale
ale
with
no
real
characteristics
to
praise
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
minimal
lacing
and
head
and
tiny
bubbles
around
the
edge
a
lemony
grain
smell
not
to
hoppy
but
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
carbonation
was
a
bit
off
but
can
attribute
that
to
the
growler
very
easy
to
drink
and
will
get
a
couple
bottles
if
it
goes
to
bottling
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
offering
a
surprisingly
unique
character
and
a
flavor
level
that
sets
it
just
above
some
without
slipping
into
almost
ipa
territory
as
some
others
tend
to
do
well
done
pours
a
golden
yellow
a
bit
hazy
with
a
fairly
good
amount
of
head
looks
decent
enough
smells
very
hopy
lots
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
on
the
nice
reminiscent
of
half
acres
pale
ale
smells
pretty
good
tastes
very
similar
to
half
acre
the
hop
profile
is
very
similar
less
hoppy
than
i
would
like
but
for
a
pale
ale
its
solid
a
great
hoppy
beer
especially
for
left
hand
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable

my
all

favorite
pale
ale
i
am
drinking
this
3
months
before
its

by
date
the
nose
begins
with
s
slight
tartness
that
quickly
dissipates
bringing
forward
caramel
light
biscuit
and
hop
notes
it
pours
amber
with
a
slight
haze
under
a
white
a
fluffy
persistent
cap
that
produces
good
lace
malt
and
light
fruits
roll
over
the
tongue
to
finish
with
a
moderately
bitter
hop
accent
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
texture
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
cloudy
deep
orange
in
body
with
white
head
that
never
leaves
aroma
of
citrus
honey
light
fruit
sweetened
cereal
tastes
of
citrus
but
no
rind
light
fruity
notes
mild
mint
honey
sweetness
and
toned
down
bitterness
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
lacking
some
body
but
nice
and
sessionable
i
could
tank
these
all
day
now
this
is
what
an
apa
should
be
perfectly
balanced
not
too
hoppy
but
a
ton
of
flavor
this
beer
needs
to
be
your
designated
bbq
beer
just
as
you
would
expect
from
a
brewery
in
kansas
city
you
can
enjoy
this
one
yearround
and
i
do
its
boulevards
firstever
beer
and
still
the
best
im
a
colorado
beer
guy
mostly
but
this
one
finds
its
way
into
my
fridge
fairly
often
im
not
a
pale
ale
guy
but
this
is
a
smooth
drink
that
can
definitely
satisfy
o
a
very
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
pale
ale
this
is
really
a
great
textbox
example
of
the
style
boulevard
pale
ale
has
an
extremely
high
carbonation
factor
for
a
pale
ale
it
is
not
a
good
mouthfeel
but
tastes
overall
okay
the
carbonation
is
almost
too
much
this
beer
albeit
different
is
perfectly
predictable
good
but
not
great
just
what
you
expect
from
the
show
me
state
i
have
drank
literally
hundreds
of
these
beers
so
i
figured
i
should
review
it
boulevard
is
a
great
brewery
with
some
of
the
best
tasting
beers
probably
in
the
world
that
being
said
i
have
tried
many
many
different
brews
of
theirs
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
it
use
to
be
less
consistent
with
taste
but
i
actually
called
them
about
it
months
ago
and
it
seems
to
be
fixed
i
even
broke
a
case
on
accident
once
because
of
their
weak
cardboardish
packing
i
told
them
about
it
and
they
changed
the
packaging
and
sent
me
money
for
another
12
pack
i
love
this
company
and
this
beer
and
will
be
a
customer
of
theirs
till
the
day
i
die
one
thing
about
this
beer
i
have
found
with
no
other
beer
ever
i
find
if
i
fall
asleep
and
a
beer
has
been
opened
i
can
wake
up
and
even
after
being
open
all
night
i
can
take
a
drink
and
it
still
tastes
like
a
fresh
beer
and
even
has
carbonation
that
blew
me
away
most
beer
is
crap
after
being
left
open
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
brewed
beers
in
the
world
imo
m
malt
base
is
substantial
and
beer
is
crispy
and
refreshing
overall
a
serious
sessionable
pale
ale
that
leans
towards
west
coast
style
worthy
of
a
try
a
refreshing
tasty
and
wellbalanced
brew
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
o
good
apa
nothing
special
but
thats
kinda
how
the
style
is
either
its
great
and
people
are
bitching
that
it
should
be
classified
ipa
or
its
a
bland
runothe
mill
ale
this
sits
somewhere
in
between
try
it
you
wont
hate
it
rich
toasty
malt
balanced
by
a
hop
bite
with
taste
of
citrus
a
real
beer
i
rate
a
brewery
by
how
well
they
do
the
pale
ale
a
pilsner
a
wheat
they
have
to
get
those
right
the
double
imperial
ipa
is
gravy
after
that
boulevard
got
this
right
boulevard
was
the
first
micro
besides
sam
adams
available
in
my
area
they
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
boulevard
pale
ale

overall
a
pretty
good
pale

good

i

fruit
in
an

than
this

brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
this
is
what
an
american
pale
ale
should
taste
like
to
me
its
light
crisp
hoppy
drinkable
and
wonderful
when
ice
cold
the
nose
is
well
hoppy
bitter
and
bitey
with
a
lighter
malt
profile
and
a
floral
and
piney
hop
character
the
crispness
of
this
is
what
impresses
me
most
its
packed
with
flavor
but
its
snappy
in
the
finish
ultimately
refreshing
sweeter
grains
up
front
with
a
glorious
bright
hop
flavor
that
seems
unfamiliar
to
me
not
sure
what
varieties
are
used
here
but
it
works
theres
a
juicy
fruity
vibe
that
is
new
to
me
here
the
feel
is
the
best
perfectly
carbonated
with
the
cleanest
fastest
finish
i
can
remember
in
this
style
whatever
yeast
is
used
here
i
would
like
to
clone
for
my
own
brewing
it
really
makes
the
feel
of
this
pale
ale
pop
off
overall
the
best
of
boulevards
standard
releases
cool
that
theyve
found
a
way
to
make
the
most
commonplace
style
of
beer
as
interesting
as
this
its
sessionable
and
a
lot
of
fun
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
find
at
places
where
you
wont
find
many
of
your
favorites
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
very
little
head
there
is
a
slightly
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
has
some
floral
notes
and
a
grainy
yeasty
taste
a
bit
lighter
of
a
taste
and
not
very
bitter
or
dry
overall
this
is
a
unquie
pale
ale
the
yeasty
flavors
add
a
twist
to
this
beer
86b
a
no
nonsense
pale
a
bit
perfumic
smell
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thin
rocky
looking
head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
caramel
base
with
nice
hoppy
tangerine
and
lemon
flavors
it
tastes
of
bitter
lemon
with
biscuits
the
most
noticeable
flavor
is
bell
pepper
this
beer
is
light
with
sharp
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
good
pale
ale
and
it
was
my
first
boulevard
i
ever
had
many
years
ago
when
i
visited
keokuk
iowa
o
its
a
good
pale
ale
but
nothing
amazing
im
happy
to
have
tried
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
again
however
if
i
was
at
a
dive
bar
and
this
was
one
of
the
few
beers
on
tap
id
order
it
all
day
long
oan
ok
apa
but
as
it
warms
it
takes
a
turn
for
the
worse
with
the
malt
dominating
bottle
was
2
months
away
from
best
by
date
o
the
hops
on
the
label
are
no
jokesmells
and
tastes
pretty
hoppy
o
a
little
more
delicate
in
flavor
then
i
expected
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
pours
a
muddy
orange
amber
with
a
slight
head
and
light
lacing
orange
light
malt
with
light
citrus
finishes
with
a
light
malty
spicy
flavor
nice
for
a
low
abv
ale
darker
and
more
flavorful
than
id
expect
from
a
pale
ale
boulevard
does
a
good
job
on
these
beers
o
nice
pale
ale
right
here
not
as
flavorful
as
some
offerings
but
if
youre
looking
to
knock
back
a
sixer
on
the
patio
or
around
the
fire
pit
this
will
do
the
job
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
came
in
a
12pk
sampler
id
drink
it
again
othis
one
started
the
greatness
at
boulevard
and
it
still
holds
its
own
in
a
crowded
apa
market
o
not
bad
but
overall
middle
of
the
pack
o
probably
my
3rd
favorite
apa
behind
zd
and
dig
from
nb
great
job
boulevard
in
this
case
i
can
really
appreciate
how
easy
of
a
drink
this
is
and
how
great
it
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
pretty
easy
drinking
and
flavorful

taste

of

it

the

is
long
and
bittersweet
with
a

warmth
o
as
i
said
before
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
easy
to
get
and
decently
priced
a
nice
one
to
kick
back
relax
and
enjoy
the
game
an
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
it
wont
blow
your
hair
back
or
call
your
mom
but
there
certainly
isnt
anything
wrong
with
it
can
likely
be
used
as
a
session
beer
and
is
also
a
good
transition
beer
for
trying
to
convert
people
to
the
craft
beer
scene
as
it
isnt
too
strong
in
any
direction
just
a
nicely
made
pale
ale
id
drink
one
of
these
any
day
m
finely
textured
slightly
creamy
and
very
carbonated
taste
there
is
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
which
is
complimented
nicely
by
the
sweetness
that
no
longer
seems
fruity
the
slight
sweetness
tones
down
the
aftertaste
bitterness
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
with
hops
and
malts
working
in
tandem
neither
side
overpowering
the
other
this
is
a
smoothdrinking
sessionable
pale
ale
and
one
worth
repeatedly
enjoying
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
enough
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
this
is
just
a
so
so
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkable
but
not
memorable
o
overall
a
solid
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
as
i
said
above
a
fairly
decent
example
of
the
style
and
sessionable
as
well
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
six
pack
for
a
barbecue
or
party
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
one
though
there
was
an
offputting
bananalike
flavor
that
detracted
from
the
experience
worth
trying
but
you
can
easily
find
better
options
boulevard
ale
at
an
airport
waiting
to
depart
i
opted
for
the
beer
lunch
boulevard
was
on
tap
the
body
is
straw
yellow
translucent
and
very
lightly
carbonated
the
head
is
pure
white
very
fine
and
did
not
last
long
the
aroma
is
subtle
and
more
fruity
than
malty
very
smooth
drinking
this
beer
goes
down
easily
no
robust
flavor
here
just
a
subtle
malt
taste
and
no
sense
of
bitter
or
hop
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
its
easy
going
nature
an
average
beer
nice
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
interesting
or
different
drink
a
good
bit
of
bubbles
with
a
nice
malt
presence
and
a
nice
bit
of
citrus
make
this
a
very
tasty
and
easy
to
reach
for
brew
overall
not
bad
but
not
that
great
there
are
just
too
many
good
local
apas
for
me
to
reach
for
another
of
these
drinkability
pretty
good
again
a
very
solid
boulevard
brew
that
i
really
wish
we
got
out
here
on
the
east
coast
even
balanced
pale
less
american
than
others
but
in
a
good
way
doesnt
hammer
you
with
hops
good
drinker
i
picked
up
a
boulevard
mixed
twelve
pack
last
week
at
argonaut
this
was
one
of
the
beers
included
in
that
box
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
aromas
of
grass
floral
hops
and
a
light
breadiness
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
grass
resiny
hops
and
caramel
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thin
rocky
looking
head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
caramel
base
with
nice
hoppy
tangerine
and
lemon
flavors
it
tastes
of
bitter
lemon
with
biscuits
the
most
noticeable
flavor
is
bell
pepper
this
beer
is
light
with
sharp
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
good
pale
ale
nothing
special
but
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
either
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
pale
ale
its
body
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
sweet
character
while
still
tasting
like
a
pale
ale
o
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
lacks
any
substantial
factor
to
make
me
want
more
or
keep
this
beer
in
my
scope
of
pale
ales
i
would
buy
this
for
the
right
occasion
if
i
had
it
in
my
market
but
its
not
something
im
sad
to
not
have
in
market
finally
done
with
this
variety
pack
what
a
ride
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
copperamber
topped
by
a
dirty
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
toffee
mixed
with
mild
orange
peel
such
is
all
and
its
all
pretty
weak
the
taste
doesnt
really
change
too
much
up
though
now
the
citrus
is
ascendant
a
slight
hint
of
rubber
permeates
the
background
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
kinda
sad
pale
ale
frankly
and
definitely
a
disappointing
way
to
finish
the
pack
d
really
not
very
enjoyable
im
not
one
for
pale
ales
to
begin
with
but
this
one
seems
a
bit
off
and
watered
down
everything
is
muted
and
there
is
an
odd
afterflavor
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
and
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
its
not
especially
enjoyable
this
to
me
is
the
black
sheep
among
the
heard
of
great
beers
that
boulevard
makes
i
know
its
the
flagship
beer
but
i
think
it
might
be
time
to
tweak
the
recipe
this
coming
from
someone
who
doesnt
homebrew
at
all
poured
into
my
ccb
pint
glass
golden
brown
in
color
with
decent
carbonation
but
only
a
papertgin
head
to
show
for
it
aroma
is
very
light
hard
to
detect
much
in
the
nose
but
i
do
smell
bready
yeast
and
feint
citric
from
the
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
just
an
average
beer
nothing
special
here
poured
from
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
w
a
nice
off
white
head
an
color
is
of
rusty
brass
kinda
hard
to
describe
the
nose
is
as
you
would
expect
mostly
some
nice
citrus
hops
in
the
forefront
nothing
too
exciting
or
out
of
the
ordinary
on
a
pale
ale
has
some
damn
good
lacing
taste
is
bitter
citrus
hops
dominating
not
much
of
a
malt
presence
to
it
leans
on
the
hop
side
of
the
balance
in
a
good
manner
dry
finish
after
scrubbing
the
palate
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
grapefruit
component
to
the
taste
of
this
but
not
a
lot
mostly
getting
the
hops
ive
had
this
several
times
over
for
some
reason
something
seems
a
little
off
on
this
one
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
on
the
hot
summer
days
a
decent
one
to
have
in
the
regular
rotation
prosit
aroma
is
light
herbal
hops
lots
of
wheat
and
grain
hints
of
grassy
notes
and
herbals
that
blend
with
a
light
spiced
rye
note
and
a
really
well
done
light
floral
finish
perfectly
drinkable
this
was
simply
an
amazing
pale
to
drink
on
the
first
85
degree
day
long
finish
of
light
hops
and
grains
that
rolls
through
slightly
dry
but
clean
and
crisp
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
bruery
snifter
into
the
sink
pour
is
copper
with
some
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
bready
maltyeast
with
big
perfume
and
grassy
hops
does
not
smell
very
good
actually
the
taste
is
not
good
again
perfumy
acidic
grassy
herbal
flowery
bready
and
all
coming
together
in
a
poor
way
the
hoppiness
is
harsh
but
not
in
a
good
way
there
is
an
offflavor
that
i
am
not
ciceroney
enough
to
identify
vegetal
mouthfeel
is
mostly
fine
carbonation
is
good
body
is
ok
not
an
easy
drinker
for
a
pale
ale
which
is
all
wrong
overall
had
maybe
13
of
a
bottle
then
moved
on
o
not
sure
why
this
one
gets
low
marks
i
guess
because
its
not
a
hop
bomb
or
maybe
im
sentimental
this
is
one
of
the
very
1st
crafts
i
drank
you
know
what
its
still
a
darn
good
beer
if
you
ask
me
really
miss
not
being
able
to
get
boulevard
regularly
o
sort
of
a
disappointing
beer
for
what
is
usually
a
pretty
easy
style
to
brew
o
not
one
ill
go
out
and
buy
myself
with
the
number
of
beers
that
are
out
there
this
one
did
not
leave
a
lasting
affect
overall
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
its
just
under
flavored
and
bland
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
citrus
flavors
in
this
pale
and
coupled
with
the
easy
drinking
could
make
this
solid
summer
beer
there
are
others
i
would
reach
for
first
but
this
is
a
beer
i
will
def
have
again
mediocre
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
of
the
boulevard
variety
pack
overall
a
solid
pale
nothing
makes
this
stand
out
from
the
pack
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
a
nice
enjoyable
thirst
quencher
this
was
not
the
best
pa
ive
had
and
most
definitely
wasnt
the
worst
it
was
average
easy
drinking
and
great
for
refreshing
me
after
moving
a
fridge
in
st
louis
this
is
a
tap
or
bottle
option
at
a
lot
of
places
which
would
be
a
welcome
choice
over
any
bmc
product
however
you
can
spend
a
little
more
and
get
something
that
is
slightly
better
o
a
decent
but
hardly
spectacular
pale
easily
drinkable
but
nothing
all
that
memorable
o
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
o
not
as
bitter
and
hoppy
as
i
would
like
it
might
be
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
once
in
a
while
but
i
think
that
sierra
nevada
pale
will
still
be
my
go
to
for
the
style
pours
burnt
orange
with
a
2
and
a
half
inch
white
fluffy
head
not
much
nose
maybe
alittle
grass
on
the
nose
some
citrus
but
not
very
strong
tastes
about
the
same
as
it
smells
very
light
not
overly
hoppy
everything
about
this
beer
is
light
and
mellow
however
it
works
and
is
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
pale
ale
comes
close
to
giving
sierra
nevada
a
run
for
its
money
o
i
like
what
boulevard
brings
to
the
table
but
im
not
overly
impressed
with
their
pale
ale
the
hopmalt
balance
could
use
some
adjusting
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkable
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
not
special
overall
solid
flavors
and
great
price
low
abv
all
on
the
plus
side
but
the
heavy
body
gets
a
whole
pt
deduction
feel
is
mellow
smooth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
pours
hazy
with
a
brownish
copper
color
one
finger
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
some
latticing
not
much
aroma
at
all
tastes
metallic
with
hints
of
caramel
maybe
even
a
biscuit
type
taste
definitely
not
flat
lots
of
carbonation
not
great
not
terrible
ive
had
much
better
pale
ales
though
so
i
probably
wouldnt
get
a
six
pack
of
this
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
and
produced
a
white
head
a
absolutely
no
lacing
poor
head
retention
aroma
was
malty
malty
backbone
and
a
mild
amount
of
hop
smell
malty
and
mineral
taste
earthy
hop
overtones
slightly
dry
finish
medium
body
below
average
pale
ale
just
not
much
to
talk
about
overall
something
is
suspect
with
this
beer
i
cant
get
over
the
soapiness
of
it
to
give
a
better
review
yes
it
was
a
clean
glass
ive
had
this
beer
last
year
and
it
tasted
a
lot
better
well
balanced
with
a
lot
of
malt
character
however
this
beer
is
a
drain
pour
i
would
try
again
with
caution
drinkability
is
solid
and
its
a
solid
pal
for
sure
d
unexpectedly
this
beer
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
it
seems
to
hedge
its
bets
in
approach
to
style
ultimately
lacking
in
any
really
distinct
character
of
even
greater
concern
are
the
unappealing
metallic
and
medicinal
qualities
while
neither
is
overpowering
they
are
two
of
the
most
memorable
features
about
this
beer
a
very
good
pale
nice
flavor
and
smell
very
balanced
and
smooth
i
do
think
there
are
many
better
pale
ales
out
there
but
for
a
bbq
or
similar
springsummer
gathering
boulevard
cant
be
beat
its
not
as
expensive
as
some
other
brands
but
still
holds
up
to
a
high
standard
of
flavor
and
quality
great
beer
boulevard
brewing
drinkability
a
drinkable
summer
brew
but
there
are
better
apas
out
there
a
great
choice
at
kaufmann
stadium
if
you
are
in
kc
for
a
royals
game
however
d
this
beer
has
a
lower
abv
which
helps
to
the
drinkability
flavors
were
well
balanced
but
the
malts
were
a
little
too
high
for
my
liking
overall
i
would
drink
this
one
all
the
time
if
i
was
looking
for
a
malt
forward
pale
ale
light
bodied
and
fairly
dry
bitterness
was
actually
more
perceptible
in
the
pale
ale
than
single
wide
it
was
a
refreshing
palate
cleanse
definitely
a
good
burger
or
pizza
beer
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
hoppy
enough
to
be
refreshing
and
make
you
take
note
but
not
enough
to
slow
you
down
with
enough
caramely
malt
character
to
keep
it
from
being
one
dimensioned
i
would
certainly
have
another
from
notes
tasted
april
2010
mouthfeel
light
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
definitely
sessionable
a
flavorful
beer
that
isnt
heavy
or
too
much
for
the
taste
buds
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
faint
but
what
i
do
get
is
orange
hops
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
biscuit
malt
as
well
as
some
various
hop
flavor
components
such
as
orange
pine
and
grass
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
great
value
at
7
50
a
sixer
available
all
the
time
d
pretty
good
interesting
enough
to
have
another
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
just
not
all
that
exciting
but
it
is
a
delicious
pale
ale
t
a
nicely
balanced
yet
ultimately
hop
forward
pale
starts
biscuity
but
only
briefly
pine
and
orange
rind
come
and
try
to
steal
the
show
the
finish
has
a
slightly
odd
astringent
flavor
to
it
a
little
bit
bitter
not
much
hop
feel
to
it
seemed
like
a
real
light
pale
ale
just
the
slightest
bit
of
caramel
gritty
at
times
nothing
up
or
down
on
this
one
very
straightforward
no
nuances
or
special
or
off
flavors
does
finish
pretty
clean
this
one
can
be
passed
off
on
entry
level
beer
persons
and
girlfriends
im
pretty
impressed
with
boulevard
pale
ale
though
nothing
remarkable
its
a
solid
hopforward
apa
that
tastes
good
is
enjoyable
despite
the
carbonation
such
a
good
mouthfeel
coupled
with
a
subtle
but
hoppy
flavor
make
this
the
second
of
two
missouri
brewed
apas
that
i
really
dig
d
this
pale
ale
surprised
me
the
malts
shined
and
the
hops
were
very
noticeable
very
solid
beer
too
bad
i
have
passed
up
on
this
so
many
times
before
better
than
average
pale
ale
this
beer
is
a
hazy
amber
orange
color
there
is
about
12
inch
of
head
which
recedes
to
a
thin
film
little
to
no
lacing
there
is
little
in
the
nose
although
i
do
smell
a
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
pretty
unremarkable
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
than
the
nose
but
really
only
average
not
a
ton
of
hop
bite
but
there
is
some
fruity
and
floral
tastes
which
are
nice
im
really
enjoying
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
d
a
very
blah
pale
ale
would
probably
please
those
with
more
sensitive
palates
like
me
who
likes
to
eat
plain
crackers
drinkability
ive
really
been
digging
on
all
of
boulevards
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
good
style
and
good
company
another
winner
d
although
it
wouldnt
my
first
choice
for
an
apa
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
bad
but
a
bit
strong
and
heavy
even
by
the
standards
of
an
ale
i
would
enjoy
this
with
a
sandwich
at
lunch
or
a
light
dinner
an
average
pale
ale
flavors
are
not
blended
perfectly
nonetheless
still
a
decent
brew
and
hard
to
pass
up
on
a
summer
day
drinkabiility
easy
to
drink
but
its
really
just
a
standard
apa
and
its
too
light
on
flavor
and
body
i
bumped
the
score
up
slightly
because
it
is
pretty
refreshing
if
drank
quickly
this
is
one
of
americas
oldest
existing
pale
ales
it
is
over
twenty
years
old
at
this
point
yet
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
boulevards
offering
in
the
style
remains
as
tasty
as
ever
sure
it
is
like
an
introduction
to
hops
but
i
know
a
good
many
beer
drinkers
that
were
served
well
by
this
being
their
introduction
myself
included
this
is
the
beer
that
started
my
love
for
craft
beer
it
is
still
good
not
a
bad
pale
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
either
very
balanced
which
can
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
your
viewpoint
readily
available
in
chains
that
dont
have
many
craft
offerings
so
i
end
up
having
it
quite
a
bit
d
decent
at
best
and
really
just
not
that
exciting
oddly
this
one
is
both
malt
forward
without
being
overly
malty
there
is
just
not
that
much
there
and
what
is
there
isnt
impressive
a
clear
amber
colored
beer
with
a
thick
1
head
that
fades
to
a
fine
small
layer
that
lasts
for
a
while
fruity
citrus
hops
rise
pleasantly
from
the
glass
tastes
of
a
bitter
citrus
start
that
ends
cleanly
with
some
caramel
hops
great
tasting
pale
ale
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
finish
good
carbonation
and
great
drinkability
d
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sit
around
and
put
down
5
to
6
the
alcohol
content
isnt
off
the
chart
and
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
easy
to
drink
pale
with
a
refreshing
quality
not
a
bad
one
to
try
rjt
d
decent
hops
for
a
pale
ale
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
perfect
for
when
one
wont
quite
do
the
trick
will
definitely
try
again
drinkability
quite
drinkable
flavor
is
nice
and
overall
experience
is
pretty
refreshing
this
could
make
one
seriously
sessionable
beer
dyum
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
while
doing
something
like
cooking
its
able
to
splash
my
palate
with
some
fun
flavors
intermitently
while
not
being
so
intense
or
deep
as
to
require
my
entire
attention
from
what
ive
seen
only
available
in
the
boulevard
mixed
12packs
in
the
twin
cities
area
d
very
drinkable
pale
ale
easily
split
a
sixpack
with
a
friend
or
have
one
to
yourself
if
you
feel
the
urge
beer
is
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
full
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
finishes
with
a
nice
body
which
goes
down
smooth
easy
this
is
a
great
beer
for
relaxing
or
for
some
session
drinking
overall
hop
presence
is
a
little
faint
but
good
juicy
malt
makes
this
tasty
d
smooth
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
here
would
like
a
few
more
hops
but
could
easily
drink
this
one
again
a
deep
amber
color
is
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
light
beige
colored
head
forming
on
top
the
head
is
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
that
dissolves
away
gradually
a
grassy
fragrance
hits
the
nose
at
first
that
is
followed
by
light
citrus
scent
it
finishes
with
bread
fragrance
and
followed
by
a
touch
of
cracked
grain
the
taste
comes
forward
with
the
malt
bringing
bread
and
biscuit
flavors
that
seemingly
dominate
each
taste
the
hops
do
make
a
feint
appearance
at
the
backend
with
grass
and
citrus
flavors
the
texture
starts
a
bit
watery
then
grows
to
become
more
medium
bodied
it
then
starts
to
fade
to
as
reaches
the
back
of
the
palate
the
growing
carbonation
crashes
on
the
back
of
the
palate
like
a
wave
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
ale
if
i
were
drinking
a
mild
ale
this
says
pale
ale
though
it
has
a
strong
color
and
look
with
a
descent
aroma
but
the
taste
is
lackluster
and
the
feel
is
below
average
makes
this
beer
a
little
disappointing
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
very
mild
not
filling
flavors
arent
overwhelming
a
decent
session
beer
pour
an
apricot
color
with
a
good
i
finger
head
and
good
lacing
i
smell
pine
and
citrus
i
smell
malts
hops
a
hint
of
grass
and
some
biscuit
smells
the
taste
is
good
it
is
thinner
then
the
smell
but
has
the
same
qualities
mentioned
b4the
mouth
feel
is
lightmedium
but
it
is
a
pale
and
not
an
ipa
although
it
looks
like
one
pretty
solid
pale
ale
that
easy
to
drink
and
5
abv
recommended
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
crisp
and
dry
earthy
hop
presence
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
sweet
dry
finish
very
hop
forward
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
nice
malt
bcbone
providing
some
nice
balance
hints
of
light
golden
fruit
mostly
apple
as
well
as
some
biscuit
grass
and
straw
pretty
complex
and
very
quaffable
i
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
in
the
warmer
months
another
solid
offering
from
a
very
underrated
brewery
its
still
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
something
that
doesnt
wear
on
the
palate
and
has
a
decent
flavor
i
would
probably
drink
again
if
offered
though
i
would
double
check
for
a
bully
or
a
lunar
ale
notes
i
liked
this
beer
but
the
flavors
are
a
little
light
and
dont
stick
around
long
enough
that
said
the
flavors
are
good
and
tasty
i
just
want
a
little
more
md
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
hop
bite
is
a
perfect
little
slap
on
the
tongue
there
is
something
in
the
aroma
that
lowers
the
drinkability
below
your
average
pale
ale
drinkability
is
very
good
d
a
perfect
session
beer
nothing
punching
you
in
the
face
just
a
good
beer
quite
drinkable
as
it
should
be
i
like
this
beer
though
it
is
nothing
special
the
style
leans
toward
the
slightly
boring
but
very
drinkable
this
one
has
good
balance
and
enough
clean
hop
flavor
to
be
enjoyable
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beernothing
to
offend
or
excite
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
most
ocassions
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
not
the
worst
d
a
real
solid
beer
for
a
few
seasons
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
balanced
taste
that
stays
interesting
d
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
i
could
always
have
several
of
these
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
spot
on
in
my
opinion
all
around
a
great
pale
ale
d
an
alright
pa
average
but
not
a
standout
really
a
decent
pale
ale
but
the
hops
just
dont
pop
enough
for
my
tastes
which
im
sure
was
the
intention
since
this
beer
was
the
first
one
ever
released
by
boulevard
i
can
definitely
appreciate
it
for
the
fact
that
it
helped
kick
off
a
brewery
that
has
really
thrived
and
is
now
churning
out
the
wonderful
smokestack
series
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
body
this
may
not
be
the
tastiest
pale
ale
but
it
is
a
good
one

well
balanced
but
not
very
complex
if
that
is
what
you
look
for
d
an
above

pale
ale
its
about
what
i
expected
from
boulevard
whose
main
beers
i
wish
had
a
little
more
refinement
and
a
little
more
balance
a
a

beer
not
much
in

anything
that

still
enjoyed
it

an
extremely
light
colored
beer
decent
head
decent
taste
the
smell
is
very
light

a
nice
fresh

scent
very
mellow
the
taste
is
unusually
smooth
and
overall
very
good
nothing
amazing
here
but
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
its
just
a
great
smooth
fresh
flavor
and
fairly
drinkable
i
could
imagine
diving
into
a
lot
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
aftertaste
is
somewhat
nonexistent
but
not
bad
either
the
finish
is
that
of
a
good
balanced
beer
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
with
this
style
a
trusty
old
friend
but
nothing
for
a
special
occasion
i
love
it
good
body
to
the
beer
nice
bite
with
a
slick
oily
feel
aftertaste
lingered
for
a
good
amount
of
time
low
abv
make
it
sessionable
and
good
flavor
make
this
a
good
solid
beer
d
good
could
have
a
couple
drinkability
good
overall
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
its
a
bit
mild
in
the
hops
for
me
d
refreshing
but
not
that
flavorful
d
oh
considering
the
abv
and
the
over
easy
drinking
heck
ya
if
you
like
your
pale
ales
to
be
loaded
with
hops
you
might
take
a
pass
on
this
ale
if
you
enjoy
well
balanced
ales
that
are
not
too
complex
this
one
is
well
worth
a
try
i
liked
it
overall
although
i
feel
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
work
with
the
malt
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
the
hop
profile
was
unique
12oz
bottle
bbd
of
102409
pours
clear
ambergold
with
a
nice
white
head
that
doesnt
die
very
quickly
good
lacing
nice
aroma
of
floral
citric
hops
and
malt
tastes
equally
pleasant
with
nice
aromatic
hop
character
pale
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malts
interesting
slightly
bubbelgumlike
notes
thanks
to
the
yeast
citric
and
fruity
very
wellrounded
lightmedium
body
a
nicely
balanced
flavorful
pale
ale
that
you
could
drink
all
day
long
super
easy
to
drink
notwithstanding
the
basically
mediocre
components
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
again
but
the
brew
is
not
disappointing
it
is
what
it
is
a
decent
pale
but
the
flavors
dont
do
it
for
me
bit
to
bright
and
zesty
not
enough
hop
another
very
sessionable
beer
from
boulevards
standard
line
up
i
could
switch
back
and
forth
from
their
wheat
and
this
guy
all
day
long
im
a
much
bigger
fan
of
their
dry
stout
and
porter
though
insanely
drinkable
for
style
for
me
anyway
some
may
be
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
punch
but
i
find
the
balance
to
be
wonderful
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
creaminess
on
the
finish
are
great
touches
overall
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
d
good
medium
bodied
beer
and
lower
in
alcohol
content
feels
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
pale
ale
which
limits
drinkability
but
not
much
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
and
being
quite
happy
d
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
not
as
much
bite
as
most
i
drink
but
good
nothing
to
complain
about
with
it
a
fairly
light
beer
maybe
more
medium
bodied
low
abv
and
lots
of
flavor
all
in
all
a
pretty
decent
representation
of
the
style
crisp
and
refreshing
well
balanced
overall
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
remains
a
solid
apa
worth
a
shot
low
abv
plenty
of
flavor
what
else
could
you
ask
for
poured
this
into
a
pint

a
nice
copper
color
with
foamy

that
leaves
a
bit
of

is

more
of

taste
is
heavy

bitterness
citrus
bubblegum
orange
peel
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
and
goes
down
smooth
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
thanks
to
the
low
abv
for
me
however
the
flavor
could
use
more
depth
and
complexity
as
it
stands
this
is
a
nice
session
brew
for
times
when
the
beer
isnt
the
center
of
activity
nice
start
for
anyone
trying
to
get
into
hops
its
not
overpowering
in
any
way
and
quite
well
done
a
little
mild
for
the
style
maybe
but
extremely
approachable
poured
with
an
offwhite
head
and
almost
no
lace
looks
and
tastes
force
carbonated
im
prejudiced
against
the
beer
as
the
hops
give
the
beer
a
grapefruit
character
that
i
dont
like
do
pick
up
some
malt
in
there
and
that
helps
proly
not
bad
if
you
like
the
grapefruit
thing
12oz
bottle
i
think
i
paid
8
for
the
sixer
interesting
that
this
is

conditioned
as
well
as
made
with
whole
hop
cones
juts
like
another
certain
pale
ale
color
was
golden
clear
good
head
the
smell
was
well
nondescript
to
say
the
least
the
taste
was
very
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
and
not
what
i
would
call
hoppy
at
all
it
was
however
amazingly
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
purchasing
this
with
some
regularity
if
only
it
were
cheaper
than
snpa
d
its
an
easy
beer
to
throw
down
with
its
mellowness
since
the
hops
are
fairly
weak
it
doesnt
mess
with
the
palate
this
is
a
reliable
sessionable
brew
that
is
widely
available
in
missouri
edit
i
may
have
caught
a
bad
or
old
keg
on
tap
at
boulevard
outpost
at
kc
airport
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
brighter
with
far
more
noticeable
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
hop
presence
review
reflects
the
latter
and
better
experience
mouthfeel
is
firm
easily
drinkable
flavor
profile
is
a
tad
sour
and
yeasty
at
the
onset
but
gives
way
to
a
mellow
sweetness
that
i
really
like
nice
malt
presence
sneaks
in
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
well
done

very

eh
this
beer
is

im
glad
i
only
bought
one
overall
i
really
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
im
sure
that
im
spoiled
with
easy
access
to

king
and
founders

but
if
this
is
what
the
other
apas
taste
like
i
will
gladly
stick
by
those
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
style
it
has
medium
body
and
the
carbonation
is
reasonable
drinkability
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
a

it
just
doesnt
have

this
beer
doesnt
have
much
freshness
to
the
malt
flavors
and
the
hops
are
very
soft
i
like
pale
ales
that
are
more
subtle
in

flavors

they
have
to
have
good
flavors
instead
i
found
this

just

one
of

looks

of

would
be
an

to
do

you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
overall
a
very
simple
and
straightforward
pale

definitely
sessionable
and
can
enjoyed
multiple
times
over
the
course
of
the
day

solid
easy

poured
a
medium

with
a
big
foamy

the
head
is

leaves
sticky

the
aroma
is
malty
with
nice
bread
notes
and
a
little
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
equally
mild
somewhere
between
a
pilsner
and
a
pale
its
an
interesting
combination
its
got
a
lighter
body
most
likely
from
the
malt
bill
but
there
is
a
nice
crispness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
good
session
pale
ale
pours
out
to
a

on

side

nice
balance
of
sticky

mouthfeel

at

it
makes
for
a
very
sessionable
pale
ale
i
had
a
few
and
kept
my
shit
together
drinkability
must
try
for
apa
fans
hoppy
but
not
over
your
head
omaybe
its
hometown
bias
and
that
fact
that
its
on
tap
every
where
in
the
philly
area
but
a
great
beer
not
a
typical
pale
and
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
appeal
low
abv
makes
it
very
drinkable
which
is
good
because
ill
be
having
a
several
in
the
coming
years
o
yards
brewed
a
really
good
golden
ale
here
maybe
its
a
bit
bland
but
thats
forgivable
this
is
a
beer
thats
meant
to
be
consumed
by
the
6pack
and
id
much
rather
down
a
6pack
of
this
than
say
coors
light
id
also
rather
catch
herpes
than
have
to
down
a
6pack
of
coors
light
but
thats
neither
here
nor
there
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
orange
zest
tea
element
is
fairly
strong
so
i
wouldnt
want
this
all
the
time
but
it
is
a
refreshing
alternative
to
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
with
elements
of
a
daisy
cutter
pale
but
with
a
low
abv
similar
to
a
21st
amendment
bitter
american
which
i
prefer
over
this
perhaps
the
closest
beer
to
this
is
surlys
bitter

which
has
a
similar
citrus
tea
flavor

off
but
not
overpowering
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
even
in
the
summer
not
really
refreshing
to
me
i
was
done
after
one
didnt
want
a
second
one
need
to
be
i
a
jam
to
do
that
overall
yards
philadelphia
pale
ale
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
not
your
typical
pale
ale
sort
of
a
hybrid
of
a
pale
ale
and
a
heffeweisen
taking
the
best
of
both
styles
and
leaving
the
out
the
worst
id
certainly
drink
it
again
o
i
enjoyed
how
this
beer
combined
a
high
amount
of
drinkability
compared
with
nice
citrusy
flavors
although
it
doesnt
stand
up
with
the
hop
flavors
of
some
of
the
top
american
pale
ales
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
seeing
as
how
im
from
philly
this
beer
was
a
musttry
its
affordable
and
widely
available
since
its
local
its
not
something
id
buy
a
case
of
for
myself
but
if
i
were
going
to
a
party
and
wanted
to
save
a
few
bucks
while
still
picking
up
an
enjoyable
beer
id
definitely
choose
this
over
other
budget
pale
ales
not
a
mandatory
musttry
but
definitely
acceptable
and
a
really
good
choice
if
you
want
something
light
flavorful
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
beer
was
a
pure
pleasure
to
try
i
would
totally
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
really
this
would
be
a
great
sessionable
summer
beer
and
i
think
a
good
candidate
for
being
canned
as
i
would
love
to
take
this
camping
with
me
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
citrus
taste
is
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
some
citrus
as
well
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
makes
a
solid
session
beer
i
could
see
drinking
several
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
pours
clear
golden
colored
a
touch
on
the
darker
side
but
able
to
see
through
some
nice
foam
sits
atop
nondescript
nose
that
of
a
light
ale
taste
is
a
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
malt
with
a
present
bitter
that
blends
nicely
together
some
citrus
on
the
back
half
carbonatoion
is
good
a
well
done
pale
perfect
with
a
sunday
brunch
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
and
its
reasonably
priced
if
you
can
get
it
if
you
lick
your
lips
after
a
sip
youll
get
another
shot
of
hop
bitterness
if
you
drink
it
without
food
you
get
the
benefit
of
burping
the
hop
flavor
back
up
id
love
to
try
a
blackandtan
with
this
and
a
really
chocolatey
beer
or
maybe
half
this
and
half
framboise
o
good
beer
but
nothing
special
one
of
the
better
yards
ive
tasted
a
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
pale
ale
a
good
balance
of
yeast
hops
and
malts
but
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
good
citrus
and
floral
hop
character
moderate
bitterness
theres
a
skunky
sour
flavor
that
is
slightly
offputting
but
not
overwhelming
a
decent
pale
ale
maybe
a
bit
light
on
the
hops
for
an
american
representation
of
the
style
d
this
is
an
odd
one
very
little
hop
character
and
a
lightly
acidic
lemon
flavor
throughout
more
like
a
blonde
ale
than
anything
id
call
a
pale
ale
overall
a
fairly
average
beer
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
an
apa
see
this
is
where
i
know
some
of
my
reviews
didnt
make
it
to
the
other
side
for
this
beer
is
a
perfect
down
the
shore
beer
i
wrote
that
in
my
oringal
review
the
low
alcohol
makes
it
a
good
session
brew
o
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
something
that
would
cater
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
can
see
myself
getting
some
of
these
for
a
nice
barbeque
outside
where
i
dont
have
to
worry
about
them
filling
me
up
the
low
abv
4
6
will
allow
for
more
consumption
too
which
is
always
a
plus
the
flavor
is
gentle
at
first
with
some
light
crackerlike
malt
which
i
understand
since
i
read
the
neck
label
is
a
pilsner
based
pale
the
hops
have
a
light
citrus
tinge
with
mild
bitter
herbal
flavor
the
finish
is
slightly
peppery
and
dry
overall
i
like
this
and
it
is
good
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
far
as
the
style
goes
but
is
refreshing
and
quaffable
for
a
good
summer
pale
and
i
enjoyed
the
low
abv
overall
pretty
solid
and
took
my
by
surprise
as
being
this
solid
o
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
especially
during
the
warm
weather
o
a
solid
pale
ale
tropical
fruits
really
help
this
beer
out
i
have
to
say
i
had
it
on
draft
about
a
month
ago
and
found
it
tastier
on
draft
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
as
a
session
brew
its
not
over
the
top
hoppy
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
enjoy
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
is
golden
in
color
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
taste
and
in
auroma
also
has
a
citrus
flavor
taste
to
it
but
not
overpowering
which
makes
me
question
if
they
used
belgian
yeast
in
the
process
not
sure
if
that
is
even
possible
when
brewing
an
apa
very
well
carbonated
light
white
head
foamy
with
good
effervescene
overall
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
drier
bitter
lemon
and
spicy
flavor
while
the
bitter
that
it
leaves
on
the
tongue
is
just
soso
it
is
a
good
session
brew
for
a
nice
summer
day
as
it
has
good
flavors
other
than
the
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
great
mouthfeel
o
another
great
brew
by
the
boys
at
yards
brawler
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
nice
apa
that
is
worth
trying
12
oz
bottle
from
traders
joe
pour
pale
straw
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
perfume
hops
citrus
fruit
and
biscuit
malt
with
some
hints
of
pairs
body
is
medium
and
crisp
piney
earthy
hops
followed
by
biscuit
malt
on
the
palate
some
sourness
is
present
the
finish
is
medium
and
dry
this
brew
needs
some
caramel
malt
for
color
and
flavor
overall
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
brew
it
is
a
standard
american
pale
ale
but
not
a
memorable
one
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
on
the
plus
side
this
brew
will
go
down
easy
on
a
hot
summer
day

o
a
good
overall
beer
i
was
worried
it
would
be
too
perfumey
and
floral
but
the
floral
notes
are
well
balenced
with
the
citrus
flavor
not
a
bad
one
to
have
on
hand
but
not
a
musthave
either
onot
a
terrible
pale
ale
very
drinkable
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
not
very
exciting
either
as
most
pale
ales
arent
its
a
safe
pick
something
okay
to
end
a
session
with
o
excellent
pale
ale
sessionable
easy
to
quaff
multiple
bottles
in
a
session
this
is
the
textbook
definition
of
a
wonderful
session
lively
and
interesting
and
light
o
solid
pale
packing
a
bunch
of
flavor
into
the
relatively
low
abv
if
it
had
a
freshness
date
id
buy
it
again
pours
yellow
gold
w
good
foamy
head
smell
is
flowery
and
sweet
sweet
citrus
a
little
bitter
pungency
taste
is
bright
and
sweet
citrus
with
spice
and
bitterness
moderate
carb
wet
feel
different
original
little
bit
of
a
champagne
booziness
in
the
finish
would
drink
again
o
this
is
a
good
drinking
ale
the
4
3
abv
makes
it
a
go
to
if
more
than
one
or
two
pints
are
in
order
definitely
a
beer
i
would
recommend
and
will
attempt
to
find
again
edit
ive
been
back
numerous
times
and
i
stand
by
my
original
impression
that
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
them
out
about
10
different
offerings
by
far
been
quite
some
time
since
ive
had
something
out
of
yards
this
bit
pours
a
clear
sunlight
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
and
populated
by
a
decent
amount
of
floaties
the
nose
comprises
cantaloupe
light
honeydew
very
light
leek
and
a
soft
touch
of
toffee
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
fruit
notes
are
toned
down
a
good
deal
though
by
no
means
do
they
disappear
in
relation
to
the
toffee
theres
also
some
light
banana
and
orange
peel
tossed
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
feel
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
nothing
that
truly
distinguishes
it
from
many
others
but
a
very
solid
offering
nonetheless
o
while
this
beer
isnt
horrible
its
not
particularly
memorable
either
well
balanced
and
flavor
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
i
am
definitely
pleasantly
surprised
from
this
offering
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
and
is
just
nice
and
citrusy
and
refreshing
definitely
recommended
o
if
you
are
looking
for
a
session
beer
this
might
be
a
great
bet
very
easily
could
throw
back
a
lot
of
these
and
it
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
as
well
nothing
stand
out
imo
but
still
a
nice
beer
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
brew
and
this
time
it
seems
alot
fresher
appearance
is
a
bright
gold
with
good
clarity
and
a
monsterous
soapy
head
great
cling
and
retention
smells
bright
and
cheery
with
plenty
of
citrus
hops
palate
is
classic
apa
orange
and
grapefruit
hop
flavor
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
plenty
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
and
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
ale
and
under
5
so
its
a
great
option
to
session
this
brew
to
me
was
actually
quite
impressive
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
coor
with
a
strong
looking
white
foam
on
top
the
head
has
a
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
grains
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
nice
on
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
what
ever
hops
they
used
in
the
beer
it
almost
makes
it
taste
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
apa
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
yards
d
philadelphia
pale
ale
is
extremely
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
this
was
my
first
beer
i
tried
from
yards
and
it
is
still
my
favorite
its
a
good
beer
to
have
around
yearround
philly
pale
ale
is
one
of
my
favorite
simple
beers
and
easily
one
of
my
favorite
overall
basic
local
brews
no
nonsense
just
a
great
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
notably
carbonated
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
some
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
often
yeast
floaters
can
be
seen
in
the
glass
or
bottle
fresh
aroma
filled
with
sweet
malts
crisp
hops
citrus
zest
and
light
fruits
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
bready
hops
bright
hopscitrus
pine
floraland
lightly
and
subtly
fruity
with
notes
of
citrus
and
apricot
lightmedium
body
appropriately
carbonated
and
extremely
drinkable
for
everyone
from
beer
wusses
to
beer
snobs
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
d
the
field
of
pale
ales
in
this
country
is
deplorably
crowded
i
dont
know
if
we
can
call
this
an
indispensible
addition
thereto
blindfold
me
and
id
find
it
hard
to
tell
this
apart
from
a
few
others
but
theyd
be
a
few
among
the
upper
half
thats
for
damn
sure
enjoyable
apa
one
of
the
better
ive
had
in
a
while
nice
abv
making
it
very
sessionable
o
typical
apa
decent
but
probably
wont
get
again
nothing
really
outstanding
or
distinct
about
this
pale
it
wins
for
its
clean
taste
and
great
drinkability
it
is
fairly
light
on
the
abv
for
a
pale
ale
as
well
yes
that
did
a
bit
of
rhyming
but
that
end
of
the
day
this
was
very
drinkable
and
i
would
gladly
accept
more
o
overall
this
is
nothing
too
mind
blowing
or
unique
just
a
solid
light
pale
ale
really
well
balanced
and
extremely
refreshing
overall
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
a
straight
forward
no
frills
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
some
nice
flavor
overall
its
a
good
beer
true
to
style
not
so
sure
but
i
am
not
complaining
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
standard
tap
in
philly
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
thin
head
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
disturbing
fruity
cat
urine
scent
with
just
a
hint
of
circus
peanut
and
pine
nightmarish
bready
watery
flavor
nondescript
mouthfeel
and
long
finish
a
right
tasty
apa
of
the
yards
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
is
the
one
that
would
be
my
standby
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
orange
peel
doughy
malts
mildly
bready
even
with
some
lighter
citrus
character
orange
and
grapefruit
following
through
moderate
mineral
character
that
accents
the
hop
bitterness
imo
light
and
drying
on
the
finish
theres
a
beautiful
crisp
clean
resiny
hop
character
that
lingers
leaving
flavors
of
grapefruit
zest
and
a
firming
bitterness
light
in
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
thats
both
crisp
and
creamy
this
feels
quite
wonderful
on
the
palate
not
much
yeast
character
is
noticeable
this
is
all
about
a
rather
beautiful
balance
between
the
citrus
hop
resin
and
doughy
malt
surprisingly
excellent
stuff
this
closer
in
concept
to
alpines
emerson
than
a
traditional
pale
ale
excellent
imo
this
clear
golden
apa
has
zesty
notes
of
citrus
hops
particularly
grapefruit
balanced
by
caramel
and
sweet
malt
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
the
notable
hoppy
presence
gives
philadelphia
pale
ale
the
feel
of
an
ipa
and
this
very
refreshing
ale
makes
an
excellent
session
beer
for
summer
the
cpj
id
have
no
problem
having
this
one
stocked
in
the
fridge
regularly
the
alcohol
in
this
is
perfect
both
in
taste
and
in
percentage
i
only
bought
one
bottle
so
i
could
give
this
a
shot
but
i
could
have
easily
downed
half
a
sixpack
in
a
setting
an
olderstyle
beer
like
this
may
not
be
suitable
for
everyone
but
for
this
looking
for
a
nicely
crafted
and
mellow
pale
ale
this
will
hot
the
spot
nicely
having
this
beer
be
suitable
for
the
summertime
is
a
nice
bonus
that
only
adds
to
its
appeal
o
pretty
decent
pale
ale
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
o
pretty
good
and
easy
drinking
nice
hop
level
for
an
apa
a
little
light
but
helps
with
drinkability
glad
that
yards
is
now
in
delaware
but
i
probably
wont
be
getting
it
again
at
6
50
a
pint
o
this
is
almost
exactly
what
i
want
out
of
a
pale
ale
well
balanced
with
malt
and
hop
notes
playing
off
each
other
well
a
little
more
body
and
some
more
on
the
nose
and
it
would
be
excellent
super
easy
on
the
drinkable
side
as
well
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
huge
3
finger
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
and
fluff
remain
throughout
the
entire
bottle
smells
of
pure
citrus
hops
has
a
light
malt
character
with
a
pleasant
mellow
hop
bite
in
the
taste
minimal
biscuitcaramel
malt
character
overall
a
super
easy
to
drink
brew
great
session
beer
not
as
bold
as
sn
pale
ale
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
new
favorite
nonetheless
overall
i
dig
this
pale
and
would
like
to
see
it
in
a
variety
case
great
offering
from
yards
had
a
few
other
brews
from
yards
and
we
stormed
through
a
mixed
case
as
well
so
i
must
hype
this
brewery
enjoy
o
an
above
average
session
able
beer
that
would
be
great
for
a
warm
spring
day
full
of
drinking
o
better
from
dreft
than
bottle
any
day
and
will
seek
this
out
again
lovely
beer
with
a
great
floral
hop
to
it
and
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
one
of
my
favorite
warm
weather
brews
i
think
yards
really
hit
it
dead
on
with
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
gold
color
with
good
head
and
some
lace
smells
of
citrus
some
breadiness
and
malt
taste
is
very
nicesome
bitterness
balanced
with
citrus
zest
and
light
malts
really
reminds
me
of
a
good
english
ale
low
abv
makes
it
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
perfect
beer
for
a
bbq
or
watching
baseball
living
20
miles
from
the
brewery
probably
helps
with
fresh
local
stock
matter
of
fact
think
ill
grab
a
six
for
today
overall
this
beer
lacks
something
in
the
balance
love
the
aroma
and
the
attempt
for
a
hoppy
pale
ale
but
just
didnt
quite
have
enough
to
make
it
memorable
o
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
for
those
who
like
citrus
flavored
ales
this
is
a
must
forced
to
choose
i
would
happily
give
up
every
other
apa
ive
ever
had
for
the
rest
of
my
life
philadelphia
6thmoore
distributor
2010
o
while
i
may
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
search
for
it
its
drinkable
a
beer
one
could
sit
down
and
have
more
than
one
of
as
its
light
and
a
decent
change
of
pace
this
is
a
great
transition
beer
to
get
your
friends
into
craft
beer
o
a
nice
little
pale
ale
here
im
partial
to
the
grapefruitcitrus
and
hop
combination
so
im
digging
this
beer
im
also
a
fan
of
refreshing
and
crisp
beers
and
this
pale
ale
fits
that
absolutely
the
best
smelling
beer
on
the
planet
the
citrus
and
evergreen
smell
is
incredible
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
not
overly
bitter
which
makes
it
an
incredible
session
beer
always
have
to
have
a
case
on
hand
i
have
found
that
many
people
who
dont
care
for
hoppy
beers
still
like
this
beer
but
then
again
i
have
talked
to
many
people
who
dont
care
for
the
beer
at
all
i
guess
its
one
of
those
loveem
or
hateem
beers
and
i
definitely
love
it
my
favorite
every
day
beer
not
a
grapefruit
eater
so
the
beer
did
not
appeal
to
me
but
could
see
many
followers
of
the
beer
dr
pretty
good
but
im
out
of
sync
with
hoppy
apaipa
beers
right
now
dm
crisp
and
drinkable
beer
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
and
really
easy
to
drink
hands
down
the
most
reliable
best
valued
beer
in
philadelphia
yards
always
works
with
quality
ingredients
to
produce
fine
quality
products
like
this
original
ppa
ive
been
keeping
this
in
my
kegerator
for
the
last
year
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
allaround
beers
and
always
a
crowd
pleaser
the
pilsner
nose
can
be
strong
so
i
usually
serve
it
in
a
pilsner
glass
a
great
crisp
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
grapefruitcitrus
lighter
medium
body
dry
finish
and
some
touches
of
fruit
drinks
quick
not
really
the
best
yards
beer
but
not
the
worst
either
d
goes
down
nice
and
easy
recommended
as
a
good
beer
to
start
the
evening
with
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
decent
head
aromas
of
citrus
and
pine
really
nice
tastes
much
like
it
smells
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
bitter
finish
nice
balance
nice
carbonation
and
light
on
the
mouthfeel
honestly
this
is
my
go
to
beer
any
time
of
the
year
i
could
probably
live
on
this
stuff
not
overly
complex
but
definitely
interesting
and
i
like
that
im
still
surprised
every
time
i
drink
this
beer
how
much
i
love
it
washes
down
very
smooth
and
youll
be
begging
for
more
its
relatively
low
abv
allows
for
a
few
enjoy
d
goes
down
relatively
easy
somewhat
tasty
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
style
serving
type
bottle
this
is
a
good
beer
to
start
the
night
out
with
it
has
a
good
hop
aroma
and
is
quite
tasty
nothing
fancy
just
a
solid
plae
ale
we
actually
keep
a
case
of
yards
here
at
the
brewery
most
of
the
time
since
we
arent
yet
bottling
and
like
a
nice
local
beer
after
were
done
brewing
they
say
its
always
sunny
in
philadelphia
and
its
namesake
beer
proves
it
the
golden
shine
bright
buzzing
bouquet
and
zestful
tropical
flavours
give
this
beer
the
same
character
and
appeal
as
an
allinclusive
beach
resort
getaway
and
the
thought
of
some
nice
weather
or
any
weather
really
and
a
six
pack
of
this
is
simply
mouthwatering
pours
a
light
golden
color
definitely
fairly
light
good
white
head
though
nose
brings
some
citrus
and
a
bit
of
pine
fairly
faint
taste
is
citrus
pine
and
a
bit
of
caramel
doughiness
feel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
and
some
bitterness
drinks
quite
well
a
step
down
from
their
ipa
but
still
good
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
low
in
alcohol
but
high
in
flavor
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
seems
to
get
better
with
every
sip
its
yards
philadelphia
pale
ale
this
beer
has
been
on
my
wants
list
for
a
white
now
i
actually
tried
this
once
before
when
i
got
it
as
an
extra
i
was
too
lazy
to
review
it
then
though
so
this
was
a
fun
little
adventure
now
knowing
it
is
an
apa
the
numbers
are
as
follows
43
5434
d
on
the
day
when
i
first
finally
tried
anything
from
this
venerable
midatlantic
brewery
ive
gotta
say
im
impressed
bright
flavorful
and
brilliantly
scented
the
philly
pale
ale
was
one
of
several
yards
brews
more
reviews
to
follow
that
id
be
glad
to
return
to
d
this
is
a
true
session
beer
low
abv
but
with
lots
of
taste
and
character
hey
its
probably
the
weaning
or
purely
regional
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
preferably
on
tap
worth
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
and
its
reasonably
fresh
most
assuredly
sessionable
brush
aside
expectations
close
your
eyes
and
drink
it
youll
love
it
or
hate
it
i
dont
care
ill
drink
it
all
the
same
smells
like
pine
yellow
orange
small
head
and
generally
very
little
lacing
tastes
like
pine
pine
and
hops
not
much
else
i
theres
much
better
yards
out
there
and
much
better
summer
beers
for
that
matter
i
wouldnt
consider
the
drinkability
high
however
if
youve
ever
wanted
to
drink
a
pine
tree
this
is
it
poured
from
12oz
bottle
a
bright
golden
color
clear
with
a
thin
white
head
much
lighter
than
some
other
pale
ales
but
i
suppose
within
the
range
for
the
style
aromas
detected
are
straw
grain
but
mostly
piney
hops
taste
is
dominated
by
a
crisp
hop
bite
with
a
clean
finish
higher
carbonation
with
light
body
its
quite
easy
to
throw
back
a
good
summer
beer
there
is
a
sufficient
head
that
subsides
but
yet
sticks
around
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
this
beers
best
quality
it
is
a
mix
between
citrus
and
floral
hops
citrus
dominates
the
palette
at
first
it
has
a
bite
then
it
quickly
fades
and
there
is
a
definite
hop
filled
taste
overall
a
drinkable
beer
that
could
compliment
a
wide
variety
of
food
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
is
off
the
hook
be
sure
to
pour
it
very
slowly
we
get
a
gold
body
with
a
massive
frothy
white
head
big
grapefruit
blast
to
the
nose
along
with
tropical
fruit
notes
citrus
mostly
some
melons
taste
is
grapefruit
and
pineapple
up
front
the
carbonation
becomes
a
liability
to
the
weight
and
texture
which
go
up
in
bubbles
before
i
can
get
a
bead
on
them
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
thats
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
some
of
my
fellow
bas
have
been
unnecessarily
critical
of
the
unique
carbonation
level
rather
than
seeing
it
for
what
it
is
overall
nice
and
solid
i
could
see
this
selling
alot
in
the
summer
a
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
and
recommend
yards
does
lowabv
beers
as
good
as
anyone
i
have
access
to
for
what
its
worth
their
website
is
gorgeous
too
although
lacking
depth
of
information
the
more
of
these
i
drink
the
more
i
really
like
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
as
opposed
to
the
overwhelming
hops
of
an
ipa
or
some
other
pales
taste
is
almost
like
a
hefeweizen
heavy
on
lemon
and
lime
citrus
and
actually
fairly
smooth
no
real
hop
bitterness
which
i
enjoy
but
is
odd
for
the
style
body
is
light
and
while
the
beer
goes
down
easily
it
really
isnt
that
enticing
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
beer
is
certainly
lighter
than
most
pale
ales
but
is
still
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
pours
a
cloudy
copper
yellowish
color
with
good
fluffy
white
head
and
good
lacing
lively
carbonation
strong
citrus
fruity
hop
smell
taste
is
much
the
same
but
the
citrus
is
even
more
potent
some
grapefruit
hints
thin
slick
texture
and
light
bodied
short
flavor
duration
all
around
decent
beer
this
is
a
very
good
sessionable
brew
this
brew
looks
great
for
the
style
and
has
a
very
drinkable
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
will
not
scare
away
a
none
hop
head
but
will
also
please
any
pale
ale
hop
fan
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
two
finger
head
golden
color
in
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
sweet
mix
of
hops
and
citrus
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
pilsner
to
me
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
the
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
this
was
an
excellent
beer
a
hybrid
of
sorts
as
this
is
an
ale
brewed
with
pilsner
malts
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
freshness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
yellow
color
that
is
for
the
most
part
clear
due
to
a
careful
pour
that
left
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
still
in
the
bottle
regardless
there
are
some
faint
particles
stuck
in
suspension
more
than
2
fingers
of
white
frothy
head
appear
with
decent
retension
and
an
abundant
amount
of
lace
clings
in
a
sticky
coating
about
the
glass
aroma
is
full
of
hops
smelling
like
citrus
more
particularly
lemon
and
a
touch
of
grass
with
some
spice
that
tingles
the
back
of
the
nose
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
grain
comes
through
in
the
back
of
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
minorly
bitter
upfront
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
lemon
and
grass
somewhat
herbal
minimal
amount
of
malt
backing
but
the
malt
character
that
is
present
is
a
bit
bready
somewhat
of
a
crisp
finish
the
hop
bitterness
still
lingers
with
herbal
tastes
of
lemon
and
grass
light
feel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
and
quite
sessionable
at
4
mouthfeel
is
average
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
those
sessions
and
warm
days
d
nice
beer
for
the
warmer
months
but
good
anytime
compliments
food
well
have
made
this
my
session
beer
on
a
few
occasions
but
not
as
much
recently
due
to
possible
recipe
change
high
drinkability
very
crisp
and
clean
could
easily
down
several
of
these
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
somewhat
creamy
and
well
carbonated
refreshing
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
most
definitely
will
drink
again
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
jump
around
inherently
it
is
light
too
light
really
but
the
yeasty
maltiness
adds
enough
body
to
confirm
the
style
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
interesting
enough
it
is
subtle
but
with
distinguishing
strengths
that
harmonious
marriage
of
the
hops
and
the
yeast
that
have
me
enamored
certainly
this
beer
pays
tribute
to
british
beer
historylore
well
done
a
beer
that
is
delivery
without
the
hype
d
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
i
could
see
myself
having
several
of
these
in
an
evening
id
pick
this
one
up
again
if
it
was
sold
in
my
area
poured
a
nice
pale
amber
with
bright
white
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
was
dominated
by
lemony
hops
with
grainy
pine
notes
as
well
the
taste
was
bracingly
bitter
with
tons
of
hops
very
lemony
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
and
some
graininess
in
the
finish
pretty
aggressive
bitterness
makes
it
kind
of
hard
to
pick
many
other
elements
it
really
seems
like
it
could
benefit
from
more
of
a
malt
backbone
that
being
said
it
has
good
hop
taste
and
the
bitterness
gives
it
a
very
dry
finish
that
would
work
well
for
cooling
off
on
hot
day
or
drinking
at
a
bbq
fairly
light
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
if
you
dig
all
the
hops
and
bitterness
d
highly
drinkable
this
pale
ale
has
a
great
hop
bite
and
a
pleasing
finish
not
too
heavy
with
a
low
abv
certainly
make
me
think
i
could
knock
back
3
or
4
without
much
trouble
simple
flavors
mean
i
might
switch
my
beer
after
the
second
round
but
id
have
no
qualms
plowing
through
a
six
pack
on
a
warm
day
this
is
a
fairly
unimpressive
pale
especially
in
the
flavor
which
leaves
a
nasty
metallic
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
its
still
very
refreshing
and
lightbodied
not
bad
as
a
lawnmower
beer
d
top
notch
this
is
low
abv
and
completely
pleasant
really
the
kind
of
beer
one
can
drink
for
hours
and
hours
since
i
am
from
pa
originally
it
is
not
terribly
unlikely
that
i
will
find
my
self
drinking
this
again
d
this
isnt
my
favorite
nor
would
i
seek
again
possibly
a
bad
bottle
and
the
significant
number
of
floaties
leads
me
to
believe
this
is
so
i
first
tried
this
beer
about
2
years
ago
right
before
the
whole
ownership
shakeup
or
whatever
it
was
and
didnt
care
for
it
but
wrote
it
off
as
qc
issues
before
everything
settled
down
this
is
fresh
and
new
though
and
i
still
dont
much
care
for
it
i
like
the
3
other
brews
in
their
variety
pack
and
who
knows
maybe
this
is
better
on
tap
but
this
is
not
a
pale
ale
id
come
back
to
a
3rd
time
the
hops
tend
to
dominate
and
overshadow
the
malts
in
this
one
but
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
best
for
a
hot
summer
day
recent
arrival
of
botmc
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
bottle
smell
is
delicious
fruity
citrusy
some
grapefruit
and
grapes
zesty
pours
to
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
whispy
multisize
bubble
head
taste
is
slightly
metallic
malty
up
front
bitter
but
not
overly
so
in
the
middle
with
a
metallic
dry
bitter
finish
this
hopping
is
very
different
the
aromas
are
citrusy
but
the
flavor
is
more
like
a
fuggles
or
english
ale
and
the
bitterness
is
very
dry
hard
to
believe
the
ac
on
this
brew
is
only
4
3
it
is
a
full
flavored
ale
with
good
body
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
up
the
appearance
for
great
head
it
held
up
for
the
whole
pint
on
tap
in
philly
a
good
head
lot
of
sticky
lacing
nice
color
somewhere
between
amber
and
copper
s
not
much
to
smell
theres
a
tiny
note
of
some
citirusy
hops
t
sort
of
a
starter
ipa
as
a
pale
ale
this
is
pretty
spot
on
theres
a
small
hop
profile
but
what
is
there
is
very
good
slight
earthy
malt
undertones
with
slight
sweet
hop
dryness
md
nicely
carbonated
goes
down
easy
great
beer
to
drink
if
you
want
to
throw
back
a
bunch
but
dont
want
to
drink
crap
beer
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
start
but
turns
a
bit
sharp
the
hops
in
the
taste
are
mostly
bitter
with
not
much
flavor
but
some
depth
in
the
flavor
that
is
there
drinkability
very
much
so
nothing
is
phenomenal
about
this
beer
but
it
sure
is
something
you
can
quaff
down
at
such
a
low
abv
it
is
sessionable
again
nothing
special
about
it
but
nothing
horrible
about
it
either
d
very
drinkable
easily
a
session
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
orangegold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
mildly
carbonated
not
surprising
for
a
cask
offering
i
know
that
many
cask
offerings
of
this
beer
in
the
past
have
been
dryhopped
but
i
forgot
to
ask
as
the
smell
certainly
came
through
with
some
fresh
pine
in
addition
to
the
expected
grapefruitlemonorange
very
subtle
biscuit
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
revealed
a
little
more
bready
maltiness
all
of
the
citrus
and
biscuit
really
hits
you
at
first
but
my
knock
is
that
it
disappears
quickly
not
all
that
impressive
of
a
finish
as
for
the
mouthfeel
it
was
very
thin
but
this
certainly
made
for
a
sessionable
beer
thanks
again
to
edbeer
for
the
opportunity
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
a
rocky
bright
white
three
inch
head
some
floaties
present
in
solution
head
eventually
settles
into
a
consistent
quarter
inch
cap
delicate
textured
strands
of
lacing
were
revealed
during
the
session
nose
is
mild
a
light
floral
hops
presence
is
about
all
i
get
taste
is
somewhat
muted
pale
malts
some
citrus
and
a
little
bready
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
but
the
fizzy
carbonation
levels
make
it
seem
a
little
bigger
than
it
actually
is
culminates
in
a
clean
finish
easy
drinking
session
beer
the
sum
is
definitely
more
than
its
individual
parts
on
this
one
this
may
not
be
to
style
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
probably
going
to
become
my
go
to
session
beer
especially
given
the
price
around
here
d
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
a
very
interesting
taste
for
an
apa
but
it
works
for
me
at
least
the
grapefruit
stands
up
and
pairs
nicely
with
the
earthy
flavors
present
in
this
beer
the
ipa
from
yards
is
good
for
a
hop
fix
d
low
abv
and
drinks
easy
it
has
a
few
flaws
but
not
terrible
at
overall
this
beer
is
interesting
ive
had
apas
before
but
not
one
that
tasted
quite
like
this
the
abv
makes
it
very
easy
throw
back
its
definitely
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
for
anyone
looking
for
a
light
easygoing
ale
to
session
d
for
me
its
just
ok
when
i
grab
an
apa
i
want
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
and
this
didnt
deliver
in
all
fairness
on
the
label
they
call
this
a
non
traditional
style
this
just
didnt
hit
the
spot
for
me
unfortunately
d
i
love
all
the
good
beer
choices
at
cbp
but
i
stuck
to
these
last
night
perfect
ballpark
brewand
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
lower
end
of
medium
body
with
a
nice
pilsner
bicuity
malt
backbone
and
a
decent
hop
presence
for
the
style
clean
and
very
drinkable
with
a
crisp
subtle
hop
dry
finish
cheers
dont
drink
and
review
the
mouth
feel
on
this
beer
is
light
it
would
made
for
a
good
summer
bear
or
a
good
food
pairing
beer
for
its
lightness
and
its
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
quite
refreshing
pineapple
yellow
color
in
the
body
with
good
head
retention
on
the
top
speaking
of
pineapple
i
get
that
note
in
the
aroma
on
a
perfumy
scale
along
with
soft
fruit
skins
a
clean
pale
it
mixes
different
fruits
with
a
zest
of
pineapple
low
in
carbonation
light
easy
to
kick
back
and
cleaner
in
taste
i
could
certainly
session
this
beer
if
it
were
readily
available
to
me
it
was
handed
to
me
from
the
handpump
with
a
finger
of
dense
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
that
would
have
made
a
aw
root
beer
thickheaded
weep
zounds
the
color
was
liquid
gold
with
nequality
clarity
mr
pendyck
is
always
talking
about
his
casks
falling
bright
and
this
was
it
yoi
nose
had
a
definite
hops
presence
ok
ill
cop
to
cheating
up
at
this
point
and
looking
at
the
description
which
had
been
sent
along
pilsner
malt
crisp
and
hoppy
bursting
with
citrus
flavors
and
aromas
agreed
it
had
a
very
grapefruit
nose
with
the
same
intense
grapefruit
flavor
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
had
a
really
creamy
quality
almost
like
an
n2
pour
finish
had
a
more
orange
taste
than
grapefruit
man
was
this
good
md
thin
for
the
style
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
liking
but
really
drinkablesessionable
a
nice
beer
reminds
me
of
something
a
brewpub
would
put
out
for
the
masses
wonderfully
light
in
body
with
a
slight
film
that
is
rather
pleasant
i
could
have
another
and
thats
saying
alot
since
apas
are
not
my
usual
brew
d
light
pale
ale
that
lacks
the
hoppy
punch
good
choice
for
session
drinking
drinkability
i
was
very
very
impressed
by
this
beer
this
one
is
only
4
3
percent
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
one
and
it
smells
great
i
tried
it
on
a
whim
and
im
glad
i
did
great
flavored
easy
drinking
pale
ale
and
one
you
could
have
a
couple
of
with
no
problem
ill
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
d
an
easy
beer
to
consume
a
good
sessionable
beer
a
sixer
would
be
nice
if
you
have
to
do
some
yard
work
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
id
been
looking
forward
to
trying
it
i
must
say
great
beer
notes
a
really
good
session
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
at
city
tavern
in
philly
d
standard
american
pale
ale
quite
sessionable
given
the
4
3
abv
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
but
it
is
light
years
from
the
head
of
class
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
a
bbq
or
ballgame
d
maybe
it
was
a
good
move
taking
a
break
from
this
one
for
a
while
odd
i
used
to
really
enjoy
this
years
ago
maybe
my
taste
have
matured
or
this
is
just
a
result
of
yards
moving
their
brewing
facilities
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
however
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
apa
i
will
be
having
this
again
it
would
be
good
to
tailgate
with
this
is
a
brew
i
really
enjoyed
worthy
of
a
six
packcase
purchase
for
the
warmer
days
well
done
the
smell
is
earthy
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
slight
finish
of
bitterness
and
grapefruit
which
really
rounds
it
out
its
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
quite
easily
feels
great
in
the
mouth
man
this
makes
me
yearn
for
summer
and
sitting
out
watching
a
baseball
game
only
6
days
until
opening
day
and
not
too
much
longer
before
the
weather
really
starts
to
warm
up
ill
make
sure
to
have
plenty
of
philly
pale
ale
on
hand
for
when
it
does
had
this
on
tap
at
cavannaughs
in
philly
nice
light
golden
color
smelled
of
oily
hops
crisp
and
clean
and
fruity
like
apricot
or
grapefruit
taste
was
lightly
bitter
nothing
overwhelming
with
a
dry
crisp
body
after
taste
was
fairly
bitter
hops
coming
out
good
beer
mellow
pale
ale
very
drinkable
nothing
to
rave
about
but
definitely
a
worthy
brew
drinkability
is
very
high
for
such
a
low
abv
but
too
much
floral
taste
to
really
have
alot
this
may
be
the
perfect
session
pale
ale
drinkability
is
close
to
perfect
drinkability
each
one
of
these
leaves
you
disappointed
that
it
is
finished
and
wanting
more
a
beer
that
is
too
drinkable
for
my
own
good
clearly
moving
the
brewery
to
its
new
location
has
done
this
beer
no
harm
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
period
poured
a
fresh
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
pure
white
frothy
head
that
simmers
down
to
a
slight
haze
on
top
of
the
beer
the
color
is
very
pale
almost
pilsnerlike
aroma
is
lemon
biscuits
and
grain
and
mild
fruits
taste
is
on
the
mild
side
a
slight
burst
of
fruitymalt
sweetness
is
quickly
cut
into
by
a
sharp
crisp
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
lingers
a
bit
too
mouthfeel
is
crisp
refreshing
with
carbonation
a
tad
on
the
higher
sider
a
light
body
is
present
this
stuff
is
really
good
fresh
and
of
course
quite
quaffable
however
it
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
in
flavor
and
body
compared
to
most
pale
ales
ive
tried
epsecially
the
american
ones
this
is
simply
a
well
crafted
session
brew
which
would
be
great
for
warmer
weather
this
is
a
must
have
session
beer
and
a
one
of
the
finest
beers
to
come
out
of
pa
all
in
all
a
great
idiosyncratic
beer
why
dont
more
breweries
make
their
pale
ale
like
this
t
much
more
substance
then
the
low
abv
suggests
however
there
really
isnt
much
too
this
beer
good
lemon
and
good
malts
nothing
is
over
the
top
nothing
is
over
done
it
just
is
what
it
is
but
to
be
honest
this
tastes
a
lot
like
what
i
used
to
think
beer
was
supposed
to
taste
like
prior
to
learning
of
the
many
diverse
styles
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beer
if
i
had
easier
access
to
it
i
would
place
this
in
my
goto
session
category
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
simply
phillys
best
ontap
session
beer
check
it
out
its
pretty
widely
avail
in
philly
and
cheap
the
aroma
has
a
mix
of
fresh
french
bread
and
biscuit
with
a
big
punch
of
slightly
soapy
lemonherb
hops
the
flavor
follows
up
on
the
lemon
and
malts
with
a
grassy
addition
in
the
aftertaste
the
brewery
simply
calls
this
a
nontraditional
ale
id
describe
it
as
a
hopped
up
english
pale
ale
definitely
tasty
and
very
drinkable
it
also
seems
like
it
would
be
an
especially
good
summer
ale
mediocore
stuff
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
yards
offerings
usually
lean
towards
the
english
style
beers
with
less
hops
this
beer
seemed
just
the
opposite
the
hops
were
not
deep
pine
citrus
hops
but
rather
light
flowery
hops
that
were
perfect
for
the
style
grats
yards
i
may
put
this
beer
on
tap
at
home
i
liked
it
that
much
certainly
distinct
but
that
is
what
separates
this
beer
from
the
pack
and
i
dig
that
a
good
brew
a
very
good
brew
actually
pours
a
very
pale
golden
brown
color
with
a
crazy
huge
white
head
that
took
its
time
settling
left
some
lacing
and
a
chunky
cap
the
aroma
is
of
musty
yeast
and
pale
malt
with
some
light
hoppy
spiciness
the
taste
vaguely
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
brew
must
be
the
yeast
there
is
also
some
tropical
fruit
notes
and
a
light
bitter
hop
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
with
tight
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
pretty
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
a
different
take
on
the
apa
the
color
is
very
light
as
well
as
the
malt
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
tried
this
during
a
recent
and
firsttime
trip
to
philly
it
was
drinkable
but
barely
the
smell
was
so
stale
it
smelled
like
a
brew
pub
after
the
weekend
very
funky
and
musty
im
so
used
to
fresh
apas
that
i
just
could
not
stomach
this
one
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
nor
would
i
try
it
again
d
overall
nothing
impressive
but
has
nice
flavor
and
is
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
id
ask
for
a
little
stronger
hop
presence
but
otherwise
i
nice
apa
d
the
pale
ale
label
worried
me
but
this
one
is
a
surprise
very
drinkable
bought
a
case
from
canals
in
lindenwold
south
jersey
bottled
on
date
i
noticed
when
i
got
home
was
a
little
more
than
a
year
not
sure
how
that
may
have
affected
the
beer
if
at
all
poured
in
a
pint
glass
it
is
a
clear
light
gold
color
the
head
is
pillowy
foam
and
enormous
taking
up
half
the
glass
it
dissipated
very
slowly
and
left
some
lacing
attempted
to
pour
another
slowly
and
the
same
thingseems
way
overcarbonated
dark
brown
flakes
settled
to
the
bottom
of
the
glassmaybe
yeast
but
have
not
ever
seen
that
before
smells
of
citrusy
hops
and
slightly
herbal
tastes
of
hops
with
biscuity
malt
and
an
earthy
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
carbonated
i
think
this
was
an
interesting
brew
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
was
turned
off
by
the
overcarbonation
huge
head
and
brown
flakes
as
mentioned
earlier
the
case
i
bought
was
pretty
old
so
i
would
definately
try
it
again
and
update
this
review
if
i
find
it
different
pours
clear
gold
nose
is
very
sticky
sweet
pine
hops
strong
but
not
really
overdone
flavor
is
very
hoppy
yes
but
it
seems
to
drop
off
a
bit
and
shifts
to
a
slightly
earthy
and
dirty
edge
the
hops
seem
to
still
stick
around
though
just
not
as
clean
as
i
would
like
overall
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brew
but
the
odd
dirty
edge
kind
of
ruins
it
a
bit
for
me
light
copper
color
almost
zero
head
nice
fresh
clean
smell
with
a
nice
touch
of
citrus
taste
of
caramel
malt
with
a
light
citrus
up
front
little
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
little
watery
on
the
mouth
very
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
you
could
put
down
a
bunch
in
one
sitting
no
notable
flaws
in
this
one
just
not
a
lot
of
taste
compared
to
a
lot
of
whats
out
there
but
sometimes
that
might
be
just
what
youre
looking
for
this
would
be
a
good
crossover
beer
have
to
say
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
bright
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
the
finish
is
semidry
but
still
refreshing
not
watery
just
enough
to
make
you
want
a
couple
more
full
flavored
and
complete
this
was
such
a
great
surprise
especially
being
that
ive
never
even
heard
of
the
beer
before
if
youre
in
the
area
make
it
a
point
to
try
this
one
ontap
possibly
accompanied
by
a
cheese
steak
if
youre
feeling
froggy
d
could
throw
back
a
few
easily
the
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
i
cant
put
it
down
for
long
before
i
want
another
sip
im
glad
we
have
a
pale
ale
like
this
in
philly
not
a
real
flavorful
beer
but
when
the
weather
is
warm
it
would
go
down
nicely
and
i
would
try
it
again
next
summer
o
easy
to
drink
and
in
total
not
a
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
pick
this
one
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
if
handed
to
me
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
watery
final
thought
ill
take
a
goose
island
honkers
ale
if
i
want
a
light
pale
ale
thank
you
d
the
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
but
all
in
all
a
decent
session
beer
quite
a
nice
beer
in
the
drinkability
department
and
one
that
compares
favorably
with
the
like
of
firestone
pale
ale
and
dfh
shelter
pale
ale
if
i
were
to
change
one
thing
about
this
beer
i
would
up
the
aroma
hops
by
about
twice
and
leave
the
rest
alone
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
was
excellent
session
brew
and
not
a
bad
price
here
in
philly
beautiful
hops
going
on
with
this
beer
very
grapefruity
and
i
love
that
in
an
apa
i
will
definitely
be
back
for
more
first
sip
reveals
a
lite
body
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
advertising
i
get
a
brief
hit
of
general
sweetness
and
then
some
grassy
hops
that
linger
a
little
bitter
overall
the
beer
is
mild
but
nicely
flavored
a
decent
beer
that
would
easily
be
sessionable
low
abv
and
no
hint
of
it
anywhere
good
drinkin
beer
d
the
ale
is
a
good
session
ale
mild
enough
to
allow
for
multiple
pints
in
one
outing
d
nice
hoppy
session
beer
goes
down
easy
if
you
like
hoppy
beers
this
is
a
well
done
pale
ale
good
pale
ale
to
have
on
standby
but
id
probably
go
with
something
more
exciting
when
available
d
a
pretty
good
session
able
pale
ale
its
not
going
to
blow
you
away
but
its
far
from
undrinkable
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
phillies
games
this
spring
with
a
sixer
of
this
by
my
side
give
it
a
try
guys
and
gals
cheers
d
i
have
no
real
complaints
here
its
a
solid
good
beer
thats
fairly
prevalent
in
the
philly
area
its
got
a
nice
solid
pale
ale
flavor
thats
pretty
unique
its
not
gonna
knock
you
on
your
ass
but
you
wont
complain
about
it
either
overalli
dont
know
if
this
keg
was
bad
or
what
but
it
was
quite
odd
not
like
any
apa
iv
had
thanks
to
aprilluvsbeer
for
this
gem
the
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
are
crisp
and
dry
it
has
a
very
crisp
and
dry
finish
to
it
that
carries
the
floral
and
citrus
tones
all
the
way
through
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
seems
to
be
the
carried
on
draft
more
than
yards
other
beers
overall
an
averageish
pale
ale
not
terrible
but
nothing
more
than
decentatbest
imo
overall
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
but
would
never
turn
one
down
an
english
style
alevery
tasteya
great
session
beer
i
expect
to
continue
stocking
this
beer
update
i
just
read
most
of
the
other
reviews
i
have
to
wonder
if
the
bottle
i
had
was
contaminated
such
a
different
experience
than
everyone
else
d
could
be
good
for
a
six
pack
on
a
hot
day
but
no
really
great
characteristics
that
make
it
an
exremely
drinkable
beer

will
be
happy
to

drinkability
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
ample
carbonation
helps
the
beer
slide
down
easier
this
is
a
dam
fine
apa
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
sessionable
due
to
low
abv
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
head
a
smattering
of
lace
was
left
on
the
glass
hoppy
aroma
with
plenty
of
grapefruit
but
also
some
pine
in
the
background
solid
bitterness
with
the
same
hop
profile
as
in
the
aroma
malt
was
a
bit
mild
and
didnt
quite
keep
up
with
the
hops
which
lingered
long
into
the
finish
light
bodied
and
offdry
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
decent
but
a
little
short
of
exciting
pours
a
great
deep
golden
color
smell
is
mildly
hoppy
not
too
strong
but
definalty
there
taste
is
sweet
not
unpleasantly
so
but
obvious
tasty
in
one
word
it
feels
good
in
the
mouth
but
not
overly
outstanding
nice
and
drinkable
too
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
one
youd
drink
alot
of
a
special
occasion
beer
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
something
from
yards
and
ill
try
another
soon
this
beer
is
clean
light
and
refreshing
very
sessionable
crisp
and
refreshing
this
will
be
a
good
one
come
summertime
also
i
think
this
is
the
perfect
gateway
ale
for
prospective
hopheads
yellowy
orange
clear
with
some
yeasty
sediment
floating
around
nice
white
head
pretty
damn
good
looking
beer
hoppy
and
orangey
freash
odor
very
grapefruity
taste
with
lots
of
hops
and
a
big
bite
finish
is
mostly
the
citrus
flavor
appropriately
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
just
soso
because
it
actually
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
warms
up
and
the
sediment
becomes
a
bit
distracting
not
bad
but
their
love
stout
and
ipa
are
better
while
not
revoluntionary
a
perfectly
pleasant
pale
cheers
this
is
a
memorable
pale
ale
ill
reach
for
this
again
drinkability
very
different
but
a
welcome
and
enjoyable
change
from
the
standard
apa
this
was
a
great
litte
find
bottle
conditioned
pouring
it
into
the
glass
was
amber
haze
in
color
nice
large
thin
bubbled
head
good
lacing
as
well
smelled
like
solid
pale
ale
or
even
alittle
hoppier
floral
with
a
firm
amount
of
sweet
malts
in
the
background
decnt
hops
very
smooth
with
some
body
to
it
low
alcohol
is
apparent
but
doesn
deminish
the
flavor
of
this
beer
very
nice
im
sure
to
look
into
more
yards
after
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
its
not
sweet
and
its
definitely
balanced
on
the
hoppy
side
but
thats
what
i
like
in
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
good
level
of
bitterness
a
nice
hop
flavor
and
aroma
and
just
enough
malt
to
make
a
difference
recommended
the
carbonation
would
fit
more
in
an
english
style
pale
ale
but
it
seems
that
was
what
they
were
going
for
it
encourages
quaffing
the
balanced
flavor
good
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
combine
to
make
this
a
wonderful
session
beer
the
color
of
it
is
the
only
thing
that
isnt
amazing
and
that
is
fine
by
me
pours
a
bright
clear
golden
color
topped
by
a
creamy
stark
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
leaves
some
pretty
lacing
aroma
is
of
sharp
fresh
hops
some
dry
ale
yeast
a
touch
of
light
malt
and
a
bit
of
skunk
palate
is
wellbalanced
between
assertive
bitter
hops
and
lightly
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
citrus
dry
ale
yeast
and
some
biscuit
aftertaste
is
dry
and
flavorful
courtesy
of
the
bitter
hops
body
is
a
tad
thin
up
front
but
holds
the
flavor
well
easy
to
drink
it
lacks
something
with
mouthfeel
but
i
find
myself
going
back
for
more
and
more
overall
ill
say
this
is
worth
picking
up
as
a
session
beer
and
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
white
puffy
head
thjat
refused
to
contained
by
the
glass
fell
to
a
chunky
white
coating
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
floral
and
piney
hops
with
an
additional
lemon
note
taste
is
massive
hops
with
some
lemonlike
malt
present
finish
is
moderatley
dry
and
enjoyable
an
excellent
beer
from
yards
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
my
glass
it
was
one
and
done
for
me
im
surprised
this
beer
doesnt
receive
higher
marks
we
first
sampled
it
at
citizens
bank
ballpark
and
we
were
ready
to
declare
it
as
one
of
the
top
five
beers
you
can
buy
at
a
major
league
ballpark
it
was
the
perfect
beer
for
the
hot
afternoon
game
not
overbearing
or
too
strong
in
alcohol
it
seemed
to
have
a
great
single
hop
taste
which
i
believe
is
simcoe
hops
the
lacing
and
head
were
excellent
and
the
malt
taste
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
hops
drinkablity
maybe
a
little
too
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
session
beer
received
from
pezoids
as
part
of
bif
20
this
12
oz
brown
bottle
lacked
any
freshness
dating
the
body
looked
pale
yellow
and
slightly
hazy
and
the
head
was
thin
but
lasting
a
good
bit
as
a
result
of
good
carbonation
the
aroma
was
floral
citric
and
much
stronger
than
anticipated
the
taste
was
hoppy
and
grapefruit
rind
like
but
lacked
much
malt
sweetness
the
aftertaste
was
dry
with
a
touch
of
hay
the
beer
felt
much
bitterer
than
it
was
due
to
the
lack
of
a
substantial
malt
presence
the
aftertaste
contained
a
lingering
sharp
bitterness
if
this
is
how
hoppy
their
apa
is
id
love
to
see
what
they
have
done
to
the
ipa
felt
a
lot
more
west
coast
influenced
than
most
others
from
pennsylvania
not
very
pale
in
appearance
for
a
pale
ale
but
thats
not
all
that
big
of
a
deal
to
me
the
floating
chunks
are
quite
a
surprise
though
the
head
was
almost
nonexistent
albeit
my
glass
came
from
the
dishwasher
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
straight
up
hops
zingy
crispy
floral
the
flavor
makes
for
one
heluva
session
brew
its
crisp
mainly
just
plain
and
simply
hoppy
and
thats
all
it
needs
to
be
to
make
me
happy
philadelphia
pale
ale
is
an
english
ipa
with
a
darker
color
than
the
traditional
ipa
but
still
lighter
than
an
amber
the
spicy
aroma
is
indicative
of
the
hoppy
bite
this
beer
imparts
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
the
hop
selection
for
this
beer
covers
the
malt
flavor
and
has
no
hint
of
citrus
i
was
impressed
that
yards
did
not
apparently
filter
this
beer
and
allowed
the
yeast
to
sit
in
the
bottle
and
condition
this
ale
naturally
the
bottle
conditioning
added
a
larger
bubbled
white
head
that
had
great
staying
power
as
this
ale
was
consumed
i
would
suggest
serving
this
beer
closer
to
50
degrees
than
to
40
degrees
to
let
the
hop
aroma
fill
the
glass
and
come
out
of
the
beer
be
cautious
in
opening
and
pouring
this
libation
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
have
added
quite
a
lot
of
carbonation
bender
easily
see
this
one
on
cask
looking
forward
to
finding
this
one

hops
destroy
the
buds
you
cant
appreciate
anything
else
after
this
one
thus
drinkability
suffers
at
listed
low

a
standout
apa
overalli
heard
they
changed
the
recipe
and
many
have
been
saying
its
much
better
i
havent
had
the
old
one
but
as
for
this
new
recipe
let
me
say
that
its
phenomanal
to
anyone
that
has
tried
the
old
recipe
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
one
as
well

and
grapefruit

rest
after
several
tries
a

on

sol
uhhm
not
so
good
reminiscent
of
arcadia
batch

tastes
actually
pretty
good
nice
malt
sweet
mixing
with
hop
bitter
i
feared
a
soap
or
overly
piney
and
cohumulone
flavor
but
instead
got
a
moderate
orange
and
grapefruit
with
some
gentle
fruits
peaches
and
some
apricot
the
ending
was
a
bit
thin
and
the
mouthfeel
was
mediuim
light
carbonation
was
about
right
which
is
funny
considering
the
excessive
head
during
the
pour
drinkable
yea
if
youre
willing
to
wait
for
the
head
to
settle
new
version
bright
pale
golden
orange
with
the
fluffiest
white
head
of
foam
consistently
good
carbonation
creates
nice
lacing
aromas
are
all
amarillo
and
simcoe
hop
goodness
with
a
bready
biscuity
malt
base
to
back
up
the
show
the
taste
is
a
fresh
hop
explosion
laced
with
the
flavor
of
fresh
baked
rolls
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
almost
casklike
from
the
tap
and
the
drinkability
is
very
very
good
an
awesome
pale
ale
the
ratings
on
this
are
all
over
the
place
but
put
me
down
in
favor
of
this
pale
ale
acquired
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
this
ale
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
and
vibrant
carbonation
the
head
holds
the
whole
way
through
with
sudsy
like
appearance
the
smell
is
all
grapefruit
like
hops
with
little
malt
very
appetizing
the
taste
comes
across
with
strong
grapefruit
and
lemon
citrus
flavor
with
sharp
acidity
and
carbonation
its
a
little
thin
on
the
malt
sweetness
and
body
so
it
comes
across
a
bit
out
of
balance
on
the
side
of
citrus
hops
im
all
for
a
low
abv
brew
but
this
one
could
use
a
little
more
gravity
to
balance
everything
out
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sharp
flavor
to
pair
with
some
food
this
may
be
a
good
choice
the
beer
poured
a
honey
color
with
a
tall
white
head
the
smell
was
of
citrus
and
floral
notes
a
little
bit
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
mostly
grainy
with
an
astringent
citrus
flavor
something
lingers
in
the
finish
that
i
just
dont
like
just
an
off
taste
in
my
opinion
too
much
carbonation
also
not
horrible
at
all
but
there
is
just
something
i
cant
quite
explain
going
on
that
turns
me
off
from
wanting
another
drinkability
ive
tried
this
one
three
times
at
various
bars
and
each
time
i
have
only
wanted
one
pint
before
remembering
i
dont
really
dig
it
and
moving
on
to
something
else
there
are
some
nice
notes
in
it
but
the
flavor
leaves
me
desiring
a
little
less
grapefruit
and
a
little
more
of
something
anything
else
drinkability
and
overall
a
little
better
than
what
i
had
expected
based
on
the
current
reviews
perhaps
theyre
changing
this
beer
making
it
better
this
is
a
solid
apa
that
would
make
a
killer
session
brew
if
it
only
it
were
a
little
better
tasting
medium
in
body
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
the
finish
was
long
on
the
bitterness
too
nicely
drinkable
and
there
seems
to
be
some
improvement
to
this
brew
since
last
year
this
is
a
nicely
hopped
american
pale
ale
but
is
one
dimensional
with
such
overwhelming
hops
character
hopheads
should
enjoy
this
one
taste
is
crisp
and
hoppy
full
mouth
of
green
hops
that
continue
through
and
leave
something
of
a
metallic
aftertastewhich
didnt
hurt
the
drinkability
however
as
i
sucked
this
right
down
soft
carbonation
faint
cereals
add
some
to
the
body
yards
philadelphia
pale
ale
is
a
few
admittedly
major
fixes
away
from
being
special
im
pretty
sure
theres
a
delicious
apa
in
there
struggling
to
get
out
thanks
blitheringidiot
a
pale
golden
color
head
is
very
large
white
had
to
wait
for
it
to
settle
to
finish
the
pour
the
beer
itself
was
also
highly
carbonated
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
it
seemed
on
the
extreme
end
for
the
style
very
little
hop
aroma
just
a
slight
woody
aroma
the
high
carbonation
made
it
difficult
to
discern
specific
flavor
elements
seemed
to
be
a
good
summer
brew
this
pours
out
with
a
golden
body
with
a
tall
foamy
rocky
white
head
that
i
had
to
wait
for
to
go
down
before
finishing
the
pour
good
amount
of
lacing
was
left
as
well
when
this
was
consumed
the
aroma
was
overall
pretty
weak
with
a
light
floral
and
citric
scent
being
the
only
obvious
components
not
the
most
flavorful
either
but
that
taste
was
interesting
as
there
was
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
mingling
with
the
citric
flavors
with
a
touch
of
pine
pretty
good
flavor
that
could
have
been
better
if
it
was
a
bit
less
subtle
and
tried
to
get
noticed
mouthfeel
was
about
average
for
the
style
with
no
particular
pluses
or
minuses
not
the
most
robust
and
flavorful
apa
but
a
decent
one
none
the
less
that
i
would
probably
try
on
tap
if
i
came
across
it
overall
a
great
keg
to
kick
of
my
new
tap
system
i
highly
enjoyed
this
brew
grab
one
if
you
can
note
make
sure
you
get
a
fresh
case
to
ensure
you
have
the
new
recipie
12
ounce
bottle
which
says
english
malts
and
english
hops
sounds
like
a
bitter
to
me
but
the
flavors
are
more
american
than
english
perhaps
they
are
using
american
cultivars
in
any
event
it
tastes
like
an
apa
and
is
a
very
nice
example
of
how
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
high
alcohol
to
pack
a
flavorful
punch
beer
is
good
happy
local
beering
the
flavor
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
something
more
conventional
more
pale
aleish
and
i
got
something
a
bit
offbeat
but
once
past
the
surprise
i
realized
its
crisp
and
refreshing
if
not
chock
full
of
tasty
elements
very
drinkable
its
a
veritable
session
beer
if
you
find
it
to
your
liking
holding
up
well
to
the
heat
of
a
jersey
shore
afternoon
so
even
if
its
not
what
i
expected
it
works
well
enough
for
what
it
is
short
of
stellar
but
more
than
average
ill
finish
this
sixer
with
no
regrets
but
im
not
real
sure
about
another
apparently
yards
redid
the
recipe
with
simcoe
hops
or
so
im
told
it
has
a
straight
bitter
taste
upfront
which
then
goes
into
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
has
apple
overtones
the
hops
are
very
much
dominant
but
not
overwhelming
it
came
with
a
nice
head
which
dissipated
your
views
on
this
tasty
redesign
probably
will
depend
on
your
feelings
about
the
hop
variety
used
thanks
to
goindownsouth
for
this
sample
a
slightly
hazy
golden
body
reveals
streams
of
fine
fastrising
bubbles
beneath
a
frothy
white
head
that
holds
remarkably
well
and
leaves
wide
swatches
of
craggy
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
bright
and
fresh
with
citrusy
and
floral
simcoe
hops
over
a
delicate
malt
base
the
body
is
medium
and
its
very
fine
natural
carbonation
lends
a
gentle
zest
to
the
tongue
before
it
fades
smoothly
away
the
flavor
bristles
with
bright
fresh
hops
fruity
citrusy
subtly
pinelike
wrapped
in
a
supple
straightforward
malt
its
exceptionally
wellbalanced
with
a
firm
bitterness
that
leads
to
a
clean
and
dry
finish
a
satisfying
and
refreshing
pale
ale
that
offers
excellent
drinkability
pours
a
darker
golden
very
fizzy
some
white
head
not
much
but
some
the
citrus
hop
taste
is
very
very
prevelent
in
this
beer
which
could
be
good
honestly
this
tastes
less
then
a
beer
and
imo
almost
like
vo
whiskey
i
dunno
but
for
some
reason
that
is
how
it
feels
nice
rather
drinkable
but
i
am
not
overly
impressed
nor
am
i
dissapointed
the
new
and
improved
formula
released
404
they
tried
to
tweak
this
recipe
a

very
flowery

slightly
tan
head
initial
hop
presence
on
the
tongue
but
this
leaves
you
quickly
with
a
slightly
gritty
flat
malt
base
taste
the
pilsner
malt
that
i
hear
has
been
added
to
the
brew
seems
to
clean
the
brew
up
a
bit
in
the
mouth
decent
medium
coating
mouth
an
upgrade
to
the
brew
but
it
is
still
not
all
that
this
beer
will
appeal
to
the
masses
more
now
with
decent
drinkabilkity
and
nothing
offensive
to
the
tongue
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
dark
yellow
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
there
are
copious
amounts
of
yeastsediment
in
the
bottom
i
had
to
leave
about
an
inch
left
in
the
bottle
to
keep
my
pint
clean
it
smells
of
light
hops
and
oddly
for
a
pa
of
yeast
i
think
they
could
have
left
off
with
the
bottle
conditioning
and
the
co2
level
is
too
high
anyway
with
the
large
and
annoying
head
taste
is
very
dissapointing
thin
and
smooth
with
a
strange
phenolic
bite
and
minimal
hopping
even
the
malt
seems
to
be
missing
thin
mouth
not
tasty
enough
to
have
a
high
drinkability
very
uncharacteristic
beer
from
this
otherwise
good
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
that
seems
to
come
from
the
use
of
pale
and
light
crystal
or
carapils
malts
it
has
a
grainy
scent
and
a
dry
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
smooth
grainy
pale
malt
flaavor
that
seems
a
bit
watery
and
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
special
wheres
the
hops
its
one
and
done
for
me
had
this
on
tap
at
the
city
tavern
in
philadelphia
it
seems
to
be
an
english
style
pale
ale
the
copper
color
has
some
grassy
and
caramel
aromas
it
is
well
balanced
but
does
not
stand
out
as
an
exceptional
brew
it
was
good
to
start
the
evening
with
but
there
were
better
beers
to
come
this
brew
looks
kind
of
like
a
pale
orange
soda
yellowtinged
orange
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
somewhat
cloudy
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
lightly
malted
with
grassy
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
full
but
thin
nicely
coating
the
palate
but
then
fading
into
the
air
the
taste
is
very
light
slightly
floral
with
just
a
suggestion
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
didnt
wow
me
either
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
with
a
rigorous
pour
this
beer
yielded
a
thick
foamy
head
to
add
to
the
lush
hazy
orange
color
the
smell
was
of
tart
hops
and
a
floral
note
taste
was
a
bit
lacking
the
hops
arent
overpowering
and
the
malts
didnt
add
as
much
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
there
is
a
floral
taste
to
go
along
with
a
citrus
flavor
to
leave
a
tangy
dry
taste
by
no
means
a
bad
taste
but
for
this
style
i
was
anticipating
more
of
a
punch
to
the
tastebuds
ill
have
to
try
this
again
when
summer
rolls
along
this
beer
poured
a
dark
yellow
color
the
head
was
minimal
and
was
gone
almost
immediately
there
was
zero
lacing
minimal
aroma
what
was
there
was
a
faint
maltiness
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
was
ok
if
a
bit
bland
some
bitterness
with
even
less
malts
boring
poured
a
light
tawny
orange
with
a
tiny
bubbly
head
little
lace
or
stain
and
showing
little
carbonation
smelled
of
florals
and
bitter
fruit
scents
a
small
nuttiness
and
a
malt
that
was
soft
in
texture
and
strength
taste
was
of
a
greeny
grassy
oily
hop
flavor
with
a
very
light
malt
in
the
background
very
thin
and
drinkable
id
pay
no
attention
to
the
numbers
as
this
a
good
session
beer
or
a
watchingfootballbeer
to
choose
in
philly
its
aroma
is
a
little
sour
and
not
nearly
as
floral
as
other
pale
ales
that
ive
tried
it
has
a
hoppy
flavor
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
nothing
special
it
has
a
really
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
but
allinall
the
drinkability
is
average
the
beer
was
served
very
cold
which
may
have
caused
some
of
the
smell
and
flavor
to
suffer
but
i
think
it
is
probably
still
rather
average
another
bottleconditioned
nightmare
i
dont
know
whether
to
hold
the
brewery
or
the
liquor
store
at
fault
but
common
sense
points
to
improper
warmstorage
at
the
package
store
this
one
was
a
gusher
with
a
hazy
golden
pour
once
the
head
settles
off
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
notes
of
gingerale
and
lightly
sweet
the
flavors
of
licorice
and
ginger
poke
through
a
heavy
bitterness
the
body
is
fairly
smooth
for
such
a
gushing
head
the
yeast
comes
through
in
a
bisuity
finish
ill
have
to
travel
down
to
the
brewery
to
get
some
fresh
brew
and
give
it
another
try
appears
slightly
hazed
copper
with
a
mountainous
frothy
head
all
i
can
say
is
welcom
to
starbucks
sir
broad
rings
of
thick
lacing
line
the
pint
glass
throughout
the
pour
aroma
has
delicate
floral
hops
with
some
mild
fruit
tones
gracing
my
senses
all
under
a
mellow
malt
sweetness
taste
is
a
bit
mild
all
of
the
flavors
are
tame
except
for
the
hops
they
came
through
creating
unbalanced
harshness
there
is
some
residual
caramel
tones
in
the
malt
profile
mouthfeel
has
some
syrup
like
textures
but
still
a
bit
thin
especially
for
a
cask
low
carbonation
very
smooth
making
drinkability
effortless
not
bad
just
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
slightly
hazy
amber
liquid
is
topped
by
a
moderate
but
rather
longlasting
head
of
off
white
foam
the
aroma
is
nothing
special
with
just
a
typical
beer
smell
no
hops
at
all
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
rather
bitter
up
front
with
basically
nothing
behind
it
at
all
very
clean
finish
but
there
is
no
malt
body
to
speak
of
no
sweetness
just
strong
piney
bitterness
i
actually
find
it
hard
to
drink
because
its
just
not
that
enjoyable
this
beer
is
like
drining
a
macro
with
a
bunch
of
hops
dumped
in
early
in
the
boil
and
a
slightly
restrained
carbonation
id
take
a
rolling
rock
over
this
any
day
yards
is
sort
of
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
this
ones
like
bombing
your
own
troops
another
disappointment
from
yards
im
sorry
to
say
maybe
their
beers
are
better
on
cask
but
this

in
the
bottle
is
average

best

left
some

little

in
the
aroma
with
a
ever
slight

smell
iwas
gonna
give
it
a
lower
taste
rating
when
a
nice
malt
smack
came
in
at
the
end
of
my
first
sip
this
brew
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
it
maybe
a
work
in
progressi
like
more
than
alot
who
have
reviewed
it
looks
like
this
yards
brew
is
in
a
word
average
nothing
more
nothing
less
pours
a
light
amberorange
colour
with
a
bit
of
a
haze
and
a
mild
head
fruity
and
floral
smells
are
apparent
surprisingly
not
much
taste
here
seems
more
watered
down
than
i
would
hope
for
from
a
yards
beer
what
youve
got
here
is
essentially
a
basic
a
nondaring
pale
ale
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
brew
no
this
beer
was
not
impressive
to
me
i
enjoy
other
beers
from
yards
but
am
left
in
the
dark
as
to
why
this
beer
continues
to
be
propagated
this
straw
colored
pale
ale
has
an
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
the
most
horrible
lagers
served
in
plastic
cups
during
my
freshmen
year
of
college
the
head
is
thin
and
the
overall
appearance
is
cloudy
the
taste
is
quite
sour
with
a
lot
of
yeast
presence
there
is
also
a
faint
cidery
taste
as
you
make
your
way
through
the
beer
the
carbonation
is
light
and
the
taste
is
that
of
a
bitter
lager
i
bought
this
in
an
otherwise
great
variety
case
with
three
other
great
beers
now
i
have
a
six
pack
of
this
crap
to
deal
with
not
again
overall
a
clean
light
easy
drinking
beer
real
complexity
is
lacking
in
this
beer
its
well
made
a
nice
beer
but
pretty
forgetable
yards
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
something
went
wrong
here
i
will
have
to
give
this
one
a
second
chance
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
clean
and
unoffensive
it
could
use
a
lot
of
hops
its
definitely
lacking
in
that
area
mostly
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
to
me
this
tastes
more
like
a
lager
than
a
pale
ale
if
they
infused
this
brew
with
some
hops
it
would
be
a
lot
better
nonetheless
it
certainly
isnt
bad
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
lacking
a
bit
it
has
a
sweet
start
of
malts
it
then
dries
out
to
a
taste
of
white
bread
the
flavor
certainly
wasnt
bad
it
was
just
simple
and
there
was
something
missing
i
needed
more
flavor
and
maybe
a
slightly
different
flavor
it
does
well
for
a
drinker
however
transparentlight
brownorangish
color
pours
a
tiny
fluffy
white
head
that
disapates
quickly
leaving
what
looks
like
a
cloud
in
a
sky
of
orangebrown
a
fairly
attractive
looking
beer
its
smell
is
disappointing
though
somewhat
of
a
grainy
and
sour
aroma
maybe
the
style
though
this
is
my
first
english
mild
pale
ale
taste
is
a
little
sour
but
its
overall
hop
flavor
is
an
enjoyable
bitterness
no
prevalant
malt
taste
carbonation
is
nonexsistant
and
body
is
medium
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
its
too
sour
maybe
this
one
was
starting
to
get
a
little
skunked
i
got
a
six
pack
of
it
if
the
others
taste
different
i
will
edit
the
review
ambertinged

fairly
clear
despite
being

lightly
hopped
nose
with
a

i
thought
flavour
is
relatively
hoppy
but
balanced
i
think
im
really
getting
into
the
hops
lately
this
isnt
overly
hoppy
though
its
pleasant
and
i
could
drink
it
for
quite
some
time
copper

no

the
aroma
is

but
a

this
beer
a
decidedly
english
character
mediumlight
body
proclaimed
a
session
ale
in
the
blurb
on
the
bottle
this
beer
is
adequate
in
all
respects
and
would
pair
well
with
certain
foods
but
isnt
something
i
would
savor
simply
on
its
own
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
orangeamber
color
that
had
some
cloud
to
it
the
head
was
a
white
in
color
that
was
not
present
for
very
long
no
lace
seemed
to
be
present
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
hops
with
a
tad
of
malt
were
present
the
taste
was
sweet
with
fruitcitrus
and
hops
a
malt
seemed
to
be
present
but
not
overpowering
plus
it
added
to
the
sweetness
a
well
balanced
beer
with
flavors
and
smells
would
like
to
get
a
few
to
take
home
next
time
beer
poured
a
yeast
clouded
orange
with
a
good
head
of
white
foam
that
settles
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
rather
light
with
just
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
was
decent
with
a
nice
bittersweet
balance
of
malt
and
hops
just
a
bit
on
the
citrusy
side
kind
of
orange
rindish
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with

and
really
appropriate
balance
of

flavors
also
flavors
of
toasted
grains
and

were
present
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink

welcomed
me
to

followed
into
the
mouth
with

underneath
fished
dry

slightly
bitter
pretty
well
balanced
and
very
easily
drinkable
a
nice
brew
not
a
bad
pale
ale
although
it
could
be
a
be
more
hoppy
i
also
have
higher
scale
pale
ale
from
them
to
try
so
i
may
find
my
hops
there
a
nice
looking
beer
from
the
pour
very
intriguing
not
an
over
powering
aroma
but
very
doable
prost
a
very
nice
clean
cut
traditional
english
style
pale
ale
pours
a
very
nice
copper
color
with
stuff
floating
around
in
there
a
perfect
blend
of
english
malt
and
hops
creates
a
refreshing
drinkable
brew
with
slight
sweetness
and
a

very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink

good
one
from

company
auburn
with

thin

nose
and
flavor
with
thin
malt
base
lite
mouthfeel
overall
ok
got
it
fresh
on
oahu
tasted
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
malt
o
it
is
what
you
want
out
of
a
pale
ale
and
it
is
a
very
chill
beer
if
i
did
this
review
on
the
beach
id
really
get
into
it
overall
cant
complain
about
it
i
would
have
this
again
delicious
pale
smooth
and
crisp
with
the
right
amount
of
flavor
pours
a
deep
amber
copper
colour
a
very

ale
with
little
hoppiness
or
bitterness
might
be
old
but
it
sucks
overall
never
been
a
fan
of
kona
mainly
because
i
had
found
their
hoppy
offerings
underwhelming
and
this
fits
into
that
category
but
this
was
part
of
a
mixed
pack
i
received
as
party
ransom
and
actually
enjoyed
their
lighter
beers
last
one
to
try
is

12
oz
7
month
old
bottle
pours
orange
with
foamy
white
head
and
nice

aroma
is
of
pale
malt
caramel
and
herbal
hops
body
is
medium
and
slightly
crisp
herbal
piney
hops
caramel
and
bready

and
some

fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
dry
average
brew
this
pours
a
semiclear
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
the
taste
is
bold
with
malts
yet
has
quite
a
bite
to
it
fairly
easy
drinking
with
a
smooth
flavor
and
a
toasted
finish
quite
nice
overall
a
mild
hoppy
beer
pale
ale
finishes
a
close
second
to
boulevards
pale
ale
taste
and
smell
are
great
delicious
would
love
some
more
really
solid
pale
ale
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
sweet
maltiness
heavier
than
normal
dark
american
pale
ale
with
a
consistent
bitterness
throughout
and
even
some
roast
not
a
favorite
not
sure
if
the
bottle
i
had
was
old
but
i
was
not
impressed
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
my
favorite
beer
from
kona
for
sure
poured
in
to
an
ipa
glass
the
unique
look
of
this
beer
immediately
catches
my
eye
despite
the
fact
that
the
head
disappeared
about
as
quickly
as
it
formed
with
scant
lacing
to
be
found
i
am
struck
by
the
appearance
the
tangerinegrapefruit
color
of
the
beer
looks
almost
electric
when
its
chilled
haze
meets
the
light
interesting
the
aroma
promises
bright
tropical
fruit
with
a
subtle
essence
of
pine
a
little
biscuity
malt
in
the
background
rounds
out
the
nose
the
flavor
brings
sweet
bread
subtle
dried
fruit
lightly
toasted
malts
and
a
balanced
hop
character
mild
pine
and
grapefruit
this
is
a
wellrounded
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
on
point
with
just
enough
body
and
carbonation
to
keep
this
refreshing
i
believe
the
few
extra
months
have
mellowed
this
beer
as
i
remember
it
being
more
vibrant
when
it
was
in
season
as
it
stands
this
is
superbly
sessionable
perhaps
more
so
now
that
time
has
reigned
in
the
flavors
a
bit
i
have
enjoyed
it
either
way
its
nice
to
see
an
american
pale
ale
that
is
not
trying
to
masquerade
as
an
ipa
and
brings
its
own
unique
qualities
i
put
this
near
the
top
of
my
list
when
a
pale
ale
is
in
order
fresh
or
mellowed
its
always
delicious
like
the
label
the
beer
pours
a
rich
orange
very
little
head
and
light
carbonation
the
aroma
is
malty
with
fresh
hop
overtones
nice
balance
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
at
first
then
finishes
with
a
light
hop
bite
decent
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
nice
offering
from
kona

imbibed
from
a
short
beer
pronounced
shoaht
beeah
glass
at
the
ritz
in

nice
light
head
when
delivered
orange
in
color
with
a
white
head
sweet
and
syrupy
with
a
light
consistent
hop
belt
went
great
with
the
seared
tuna
appetizer
tenderest
ive
ever
had
filet
main
course
and
following
cheese
plate
switched
to
cabernet
for
desert
not
sure
if
it
was
as
good
as
it
would
be
fresh
on
the
big
island
but
tasty
nonetheless
on
tap
nice
head
and
lacing
very
good
session
like
ipa
o
different
than
other
apas
ive
had
solid
o
easy
drinking
flavor
was
a
little
blah
different
type
of
pale
ale
than
say
a
sierra
malty
caramel
but
with
a
few
stages
of
hop
flavor
toward
the
end
very
drinkable
fruit
flavors
followed
by
a
distinct
readiness
caramel
and
malts
good
not
great
pale
ale
but
perhaps
a
bit
jaded
as
i
live
on
the
islands
and
can
pick
this
up
fairly
cheap
pour
creates
a
thick
head
that
hangs
around
nice
lacing
not
a
ton
of
flavor
on
the
front
when
cold
but
has
an
ok
finish
as
it
warms
the
flavor
moves
to
the
front
but
not
a
lot
of
finish
then
decent
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
ton
of
flavor
certainly
wouldnt
avoid
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
o
ok
just
not
a
great
pale
ale
sessionable
very
close
to
bright
clearness
but
there
is
a
little
haze
to
it
very
soft
brown
color
hints
of
orange
nice
lace
sits
on
the
top
where
a
nice
white
head
used
to
sit
somewhat
tart
in
the
nose
black
currant
and
cherries
meshed
with
hops
and
wet
grain
feed
alcohol
right
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
wasnt
expecting
that
some
cinnamon
and
toasted
grain
in
there
as
well
really
nice
aftertaste
hops
and
crushed
pepper
a
little
watery
maybe
but
really
not
a
lot
of
complaints
here
im
enjoying
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
o
this
one
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
im
not
sure
if
the
off
flavors
are
intentional
or
due
to
the
two
and
a
half
months
it
sat
in
its
box
regardless
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
pale
ale
loved
this
pale
ale
very
fruity
and
tasty
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
hint
of
red

and
retention

tropical

passion
fruit

caramel
heavy
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
slick
oily
texture
average
carbonation
level
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
taste
profile
is
balanced
between
the
flavors
of
the
nose
it
begins
with
tropical
notes
flows
to
a
bit
of
spice
and
ends
with
a
light
bitterness
over
caramel
i
did
as
they
directed
and
simply
allowed
the
lava
i
mean
liquid
flow
from
the
bottle
and
into
my
glass
this
set
up
a
pseudocascade
which
then
settled
into
three
fingers
of
dense

with
good
retention

with

as
the

slowly
fell
it
left
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
nose
had
a
light
grapefruitcitrusiness
to
it
along
with
a
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
the
taste
was
intensely
citrusy
and
probably
pushes
the
envelope
between
an
apa
and
an
aipa
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
this
was
right
in
my
wheelhouse
but
for
style
mavens
it
might
be
just
a
tad
too
hoppy
finish
was
semidry
with
a
light
caramel
sweetness
kicking
in
to
better
align
it
with
its
style
i
now
await
its
release
in
cans
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
kona
beers
i
was
surprised
that
this
beer
was
so
flavorful
seeing
as
it
is
a
pale
ale
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
guy
is
great
pours
into
a
glass
looking
just
swell
smells
fine
tastes
fantastic
good
beer
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
i
purchased
this
beer
thinking
that
it
would
pair
well
with
pizza
while
i
did
thoroughly
enjoy
the
beer
overall
it
did
not
pair
well
the
initial
smell
and
taste
were
fantastic
but
the
beer
was
heavier
than
i
anticipated
i
will
more
than
likely
purchase
this
beer
again
overall
a
very
disappointing
beer
wouldnt
look
for
this
one
again
unless
of
course
it
would
be
a
freebie
o
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
worst
excuse
for
a
beer
ive
ever
had
it
makes
rolling
rock
taste
good
im
glad
someone
gave
it
to
me
to
try
and
that
i
did
not
actually
spend
any
money
on
it
heat
may
have
gotten
to
this
bottle
but
even
taking
that
into
consideration
it
still
has
no
redeeming
qualities
id
give
it
an
even
lower
rating
if
i
could
avoid
i
had
this
on
draught
in
maui
where
it
was
presumably
brewed
at
the
kona
brewery
and
i
remember
while
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
i
was
more
impressed
with
the
toasted
barley
flavor
and
crispness
of
this
apa
in
this
form
it
is
still
totally
drinkable
if
unremarkable
overall
solid
beer
can
drink
a
few
of
these
no
particular
element
jumps
out
and
grabs
you
but
tasty
just
the
same
worth
a
try
o
this
apas
flavor
profile
was
just
a
bit
too
malty
without
enough
hop
balance
for
my
tastes
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
with
the
ample
selection
of
apas
in
oregon
i
will
probably
not
be
returning
to
this
brew
anytime
soon
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
something
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
good
gold
color
and
a
nice
head
that
slowly
melts
away
with
light
lacing
smell
is
light
taste
is
good
with
a
slightly
fruity
start
and
a
light
bready
finish
some
light
hop
ending
a
little
more
kick
would
take
this
beer
to
the
next
level
nice
job
though
no
matter
this
one
is
definitely
at
least
average
for
the
style
and
probably
better
than
average
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
and
it
might
even
become
a
goto
for
someone
who
hasnt
yet
writtenoff
all
of
the
beers
brewed
by
cba
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
recommend
it
although
it
is
sessionable
at
5

it
is
also
rather

that
smooths
into
a
decent
amount
of
biscuitymalt

hops
bitterness
ends
with
slight
alcohol
heat
mild
bodied
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
would
appreciate
a
little
more
taste
depth
but
for
a
simple
pale
ale
this
is
quite
good
and
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
i
cant
lie
i
tend
to
think
many
pale
ales
are
boring
and
lack
character
that
can
not
be
said
of
this
kona
brew
its
wonderful
to
look
at
and
even
better
to
drink
full
of
creamy
sweet
in
depth
flavors
this
is
a
very
good
pa
probably
one
of
my
favorites
cheers
o
easy
to
drink
this
would
an
excellent
introductory
beer
for
someone
looking
to
make
the
transition
from
macro
lagers
into
craft
in
my
opinion
this
bear
wasnt
bad
but
not
super
great
either
just
ok
i
like
pale
ales
and
theres
a
nice
amount
of
hops
to
this
beer
without
being
overly
bitter
theres
definitely
a
bit
a
malt
too
the
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
be
a
lovely
addition
to
any
summer
tiki
party
the
aromaflavor
is
fairly
delicate
with
mild
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
a
semisweet
malt
backbone
very
clean
in
the
aftertaste
with
just
a
touch
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
well
as
a
bit
of
crispness
overall
an
easy
drinking
and

o
i
enjoyed
the
minerally
characteristic
of
this
brew
it
comes
off
as
a
pepperyflintiness
that
just
makes
that
beers
finish
fantastic
great
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
the
approach
to
the
style
that
i
prefer
edit
after
drinking
a
few
more
mouthfuls
i
can
get
more
hops
and
bitterness
than
at
first
it
actually
seems
true
to
style
or
maybe
a
little
more
malty
than
i
would
like
but
it
seems
more
true
to
style
after
a
few
gulps
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
and
this
one
hit
the
spot
went
down
smooth
and
had
a
great
aftertaste
ill
be
picking
up
more
soon
overall
drinkability
when
first
poured
i
simply
thought
this
was
like
so
many
other
apas
ive
had
as
it
warmed
up
and
got
more
balanced
and
the
mango
flavor
came
out
i
liked
it
more
and
more
and
drank
it
down
fairly
quickly
quite
a
drinkable
brew
i
could
easily
have
another
one
without
batting
an
eye
went
well
with
dinner
pepper
wine
sauce
chicken
buttered
carrots
and
i
think
it
would
go
well
all
by
itself
or
with
other
meals
as
well
ill
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
o
i
was
surprised
overall
by
this
beer
for
a
pale
ale
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
have
such
a
variety
of
flavor
ranging
from
hopforward
to
sweet
breadyness
deffinetly
a
good

atmosphere
is
pretty
solid

not

i
thought
the

was
a

okay
id
say
overall
it
is
a
little
better
than
average
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
if
someone
is
offering
or
the
variety
12pack
is
on
sale
next
summer
i
may
pick
it
up
my
wife
likes
the

that
comes
in
the
pack
not
sure
what
makes
this
hawaiianstyle
but
it
is
a
great
apa
ogood
hop
taste
that
made
this
beer
very
good
overall
this
is
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
see
anything
wrong
with
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
these
from
time
to
time
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
its
almost
like
a
light
ipa
especially
as
it
warms
the
orangey
hop
flavors
become
much
more
pronounced
im
sure
ill
have
this
again
this
reminds
me
more
of
english
bitter
strangely
but
theres
no
complaints
here
in
any
case
i
wasnt
blown
away
worth
another
try
since
when
i
had
it
on
tap
in
fl
a
few
years
ago
it
was
fantastic
served
in
a
pint

appearance
beautiful
shade

amber
very
easy
pale
ale
to
drink
this
beer
does
feel
like
a
tropical
beer
or
like
a
beer
from
hawaii
i
would
have
this
beer
again
this
is
a
somewhat
complex
but
not
a
blow
me
away
type
of
pale
ale
it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
even
though
it
has
a
low
hop
content
however
without
the
in
your
face
hops
this
brew
might
make
a
good
session
brew
overall
solid
representation
of
an
american

and
carbonation
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
sweetness
from
caramel
malts
biscuity
nutty
flavor
lightly
roasted
malts
hop
flavor
is
floral
forward
and
floralfruity
back
a
tasty
and
satisfying
ale
that
is
a
cross
between
a
pale
and
amber
color
and
flavor
wise
overall
im
not
sure
if
it
is
because
im
starved
of
the
good
american
craft
beer
scene
out
here
in
japan
but
this
was
much
better
than
i
remembered
it
dont
drink
it
too
cold
and
the
flavor
is
fantastic
and
for
those
reviewing
this
who
say
it
doesnt
have
enough
ibus
try
an
ipa
this
nailed
my
pale
ale
fetish
this
particular
brew
the
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
for
the
most
part
good
looks
great
in
the
glass
has
a
nice
white
head
and
staying
power
but
for
a
pale
ale
which
im
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
has
the
strongest
of
aftertastes
i
have
ever
experienced
if
you
put
that
aside
it
really
has
a
nice
pale
ale
taste
bold
and
refreshing
definitely
a
good
summertime
brew
to
share
with
good
friends
and
during
relaxing
times
overall
pretty
solid
apa
great
bready
notes
that
has
some
good
sweetness
there
is
a
nice
herbal
and
grassy
hop
note
that
is
also
slight
piney
pretty
good
brew
pours
out
to
a
creamy
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
color
is
a
brilliant
orange
copper
aroma
is
hop
dominant
with
citrusy
hops
and
crystal
malts
to
balance
flavor
is
supremely
balanced
between
sticky
biscuity
malts
and
citrusfloral
hops
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
and
i
am
liking
this
overall
a
tasty
rich
but
sessionable
apa
the
verdict
good
beer
very
well
balanced
and
moderately
complex
my
first
exposure
to
kona
left
me
underwhelmed
but
im
beginning
to
become
a
fan
considering
that
they
are
partially
owned
by
anheuserbusch
along
with
their
sister
brewery
widmer
brothers
they
continue
to
crank
out
some
pretty
good
stuff
o
good
i
much
prefer
american
ale
when
the
fruity
flavours
are
played
down
a
bit
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
probably
misclassified
as
a
pale
ale
but
whatever
brown
ale
might
be
a
better
description
once
you
get
past
the
look
and
commonplace
smell
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
bronze
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
sparse
lacing
within
seconds
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
and
pine
i
feel
like
ive
smelled
this
same
aroma
dozens
of
other
times
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
and
leans
heavily
toward
the
sweet
side
of
things
in
fact
i
detect
virtually
no
bitterness
whatsoever
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lower
than
optimal
carbonation
and
a
sticky
texture
overall
this
is
a
pretty
mundane
pale
ale
that
i
will
pass
on
next
time
overall
drinkability
not
as
good
as
pipeline
porter
or
coconut
brown
not
even
close
enjoyable
to
start
but
not
great
in
the
end
eric
d
perfectly
average
pale
ale
that
boasts
a
malty
profile
with
some
complementary
bitters
has
some
nice
balance
in
flavors
actually
just
offers
very
little
to
get
excited
about
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
o
the
fizz
and
hop
bitterness
is
about
all
there
is
making
it
not
very
sessionable
and
a
bit
onedimensional
the
hops
are
mostly
bitterness
and
no
any
flavor
or
aroma
to
them
fir
rock
pale
ale
is
more
of
an
amber
if
you
ask
me
but
i
wont
judge
based
on
that
its
a
good
beer
it
is
interesting
and
something
different
hawaiianstyle
i
suppose
i
can
appreciate
a
beer
that
breaks
from
the
norms
and
even
the
definition
of
such
a
broad
style
notes
that
bring
to
mind
sweet
oatmeal
with
raisins
are
balanced
out
by
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
this
is
far
less
bitter
or
refreshing
than
your
typical
snpa
model
overall
an
ok
pale
ale
mouthfeel
this
is
the
best
part
of
this
ipa
very
round
and
drinkable
i
am
having
this
in
a
cold
danish
march
with
a
foot
of
snow
outside
however
i
believe
that
this
ipa
will
truly
prove
its
worth
on
a
warmer
summer
day
overall
impression
an
immensely
drinkable
complex
and
refreshing
pale
ale
seems
a
bit
heavier
handed
on
the
malt
than
what
im
used
to
but
really
enjoyable
nicely
done
aloha
trying
the
kona
brew
fire
rock
its
decent
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
with
a
finger
thick
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
smell
is
mostly
caramel
type
malt
not
much
hops
the
taste
is
a
well
balance
pale
ale
but
the
malt
is
more
pronounced
than
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
would
be
good
to
session
o
a
very
good
fruit
forward
pale
ale
with
lots
of
tropical
hop
flavors
fitting
i
suppose
for
a
brewery
in
hawaii
tastetoasted
malt
herbal
and
floral
hop
notes
citrus
rind
bitterness
snakes
in
and
out
balanced
by
caramel
and
a
bit
of
mineral
essence
very
tasty
and
exceptionally
wellbalanced
nothing
overthetop
just
classic
american
pale
excellent
flavor
and
character
great
with
a
hunk
of
aged
white
cheddar
ted
nugent
sets
rocks
on
fire
get
used
to
it
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
pine
needles
mild
caramel
and
light
orange
rind
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
more
orange
and
a
touch
of
flowers
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
if
not
altogether
distinguished
brew
nuff
said
this
is
a
bare
bones
pale
ale
for
sure
but
some
of
the
hoppy
characteristics
are
different
here
definitely
in
ways
that
i
havent
found
in
the
apa
style
before
while
not
inyourface
in
any
way
indeed
its
balanced
nature
is
what
i
enjoy
about
it
i
will
try
more
beers
from
kona
brewing
co
in
the
future
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ring
of
white
lace
it
looks
like
a
typical
filtered
american
pale
ale
not
bad
but
not
really
the
point
of
the
beer
scents
of
citrus
pith
grapefruit
pine
light
floral
aromas
and
tropical
fruit
not
near
as
intense
as
in
a
standard
west
coast
ipa
but
a
very
similar
more
nuanced
and
subdued
version
of
the
scent
profile
quite
nice
taste
is
mildly
bitter
with
pine
resin
grapefruit
pith
some
faint
grassy
and
floral
hop
notes
and
a
bitter
finish
there
is
a
nice
yet
subdued
caramel
malt
backbone
keeping
the
flavor
balanced
its
not
too
sweet
nor
too
bitter
very
true
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semidrying
finish
its
nice
and
easy
to
drink
but
maybe
a
bit
too
light
and
a
little
too
drying
overall
quite
nice
though
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
its
not
the
best
in
its
style
by
a
long
shot
but
its
not
bad
and
a
good
choice
when
nothing
else
is
around
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
pretty
standard
for
the
style
but
good
toasted
biscuit
and
cracker
malts
some
what
syrupy
palate
malt
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
earthy
orange
bitterness
from
the
hops
crisp
feeling
on
the
finish
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
session
very
run
of
the
mill
stuff
a
below
average
pale
ale
no
real
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
was
too
fizzy
this
pale
is
pretty
malty
i
also
get
some
unusualearthy
spice
almost
like
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
the
balance
is
a
little
off
but
this
is
a
pleasurable
flavor
on
the
whole
overall
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
stone
pale
ale
its
maltforward
and
hoppy
but
not
overly
hoppy
its
not
going
to
get
confused
for
an
ipa
which
is
fine
by
me
in
a
pale
ale
i
bought
this
as
a
single
to
tryreview
but
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
buy
a
sixer
of
it
bottle
from
a
six
pack
this
pours
a
light
copper
orange
with
small
white
head
smells
fruity
tropical
with
some
caramel
from
the
malt
taste
of
pineapple
not
much
hop
bite
slightly
sweet
on
the
palate
pretty
decent
goes
down
easy
with
medium
carbonation
and
relatively
light
mouthfeel
solid
summer
beer
but
not
the
bite
i
was
hoping
for
onot
exactly
what
i
want
from
my
pale
ales
its
a
bit
too
fruity
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
this
is
quite
girly
for
an
apa
the
flavors
are
fairly
watery
as
well
even
tastes
somewhat
adjunct
i
like
a
lot
of
kona
beers
but
this
was
a
let
down
this
is
a
drinkable
standard
for
the
masses
beer
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
a
beautiful
color
somewhere
between
copper
and
golden
brown
its
head
is
offwhite
and
frothy
there
is
a
slight
haze
to
it
and
carbonation
is
noticeable
it
smells
great
i
am
picking
up
pineapple
grapefruit
as
well
as
some
nice
malt
sugars
the
citrus
scent
is
also
present
as
advertised
wow
this
is
a
magnificent
apa
great
balance
of
fruity
notes
toasted
malts
and
unique
hops
this
beer
coats
the
mouth
nicely
and
the
sugary
taste
fades
out
to
a
somewhat
dry
finish
medium
bodied
and
slightly
warming
on
the
way
down
when
i
first
tasted
this
on
tap
at
firewaters
in
atlantic
city
i
thought
it
was
almost
hoppy
enough
to
be
like
an
ipa
but
i
am
not
getting
that
at
all
this
time
from
the
bottle
overall
a
real
treat
do
not
hesitate
to
buy
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
bodied
full
carbonation
sweet
finish
this
a
pretty
decent
pale
ale
but
not
really
hoppy
enough
for
me
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
piney
and
flowery
hops
and
light
malt
tastes
of
bitter
piney
hops
and
slight
alcohol
along
with
some
darker
malt
with
slight
caramel
flavor
beer
is
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
finishes
nicely
overall
an
above
average
beer
great
brew
a
fantastic
pale
ale
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
you
that
wonder
this
is
very
close
if
not
already
an
india
pale
ale
little
bitter
and
definitely
quite
tasty
hope
you
enjoy
as
much
as
i
did
salud
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
but
i
probably
wouldnt
grab
for
this
one
again
at
the
store
it
just
doesnt
tickle
my
palate
o
a
slightly
hoppy
fairly
balanced
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
with
a
steak
or
a
creamy
comfort
food
meal
or
all
on
its
own
pint
after
delicious
pint
malt
dominates
and
hop
presence
is
buried
but
carbonation
is
nice
crisp
for
whats
there
this
is
a
brew
i
would
try
again
but
because
the
hops
played
second
fiddle
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
cant
put
your
finger
on
it
but
you
know
its
pretty
good
very
tropical
in
texture
and
flavor
something
that
is
the
signature
of
kona
brewing
i
found
this
pale
ale
to
be
very
typical
with
a
slight
bit
of
complexity
i
wouldnt
put
this
one
above
sn
pale
ale
but
it
was
certainly
inline
o
a
very
good
apa
that
is
a
good
counterpoint
to
maltier
pale
ales
and
is
recommended
as
a
session
beer
especially
if
you
like
hoppier
beers
a
little
more
fizz
and
it
would
be
truly
amazing
overall
very
enjoyable
an
excellent
session
beer
and
great
for
warm
weather
the
only
hawaiian
pale
ale
i
have
tried
before
is
a
decent
ontario
concoction
brewed
with
pineapple
juice
spearhead
i
expected
something
similar
but
this
is
a
true
american
pale
ale
and
is
a
much
nicer
surprise
definitely
a
beer
i
would
recommend
overall
a
well
executed
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
the
aromas
and
taste
form
this
brew
this
is
my
first
kona
brewing
offering
and
was
impressed
a
definite
try
while
in
hawaii
a
slightly
different
take
on
a
traditional
pale
ale
kona
brewing
has
been
in
my
rotation
recently
i
have
not
been
disappointed
in
the
least
a
crowd
pleaser
for
sure
o
average
pale
ale
very
sweet
and
light
bitterness
rather
nice
but
falls
short
of
exceptional
pretty
heavy
on
the
malt
while
the
aromatic
hops
seem
indistinct
and
lacking
in
presence
especially
in
the
taste
the
body
is
good
and
it
has
a
pleasing
spicy
quality
surprisingly
dark
for
a
pale
ale
overall
a
highly
drinkable
ale
that
goes
down
easily
but
is
unlikely
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
worth
sampling
o
more
then
decent
stuff
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
no
problem
im
finding
myself
warming
to
many
of
these
kona
offerings
as
i
may
have
judged
this
book
prematurely
by
its
cba
cover
recommended
fyi
kona
comes
from
portsmouth
brewery
in
new
hampshire
not
hawaii
contrary
to
popular
belief
overall
it
is
an
average
pale
ale
as
stated
above
flavors
could
be
more
pronounced
and
a
little
more
hops
would
not
hurt
either
overall
it
is
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
despite
the
smell
not
having
any
hops
i
didnt
mind
for
my
tastes
i
would
have
this
again
copper
colored
with
a
healthy
head
of
white
foam
just
a
dang
solid
american
pale
here
mild
caramel
and
biscuit
with
a
balancing
dose
of
clean
hop
bitters
mint
orange
zest
and
bit
of
herb
and
earth
fill
out
the
hop
flavoraroma
component
clean
and
balanced
classic
flagshiptype
pale
ale
that
should
pair
with
all
types
of
food
this
bottle
washed
down
some
street
tacos
like
a
champ
edit
well
now
hold
on
roast
chicken
comes
to
the
rescue
of
yet
another
beer
i
mentioned
that
this
was
a
beer
to
have
while
you
eat
just
a
generic
beery
accompaniment
that
wouldnt
distract
so
thats
what
i
did
roast
chicken
and
veg
with
pan
sauce
and
this
beer
suddenly
these
other
flavors
come
out
it
was
actually
pretty
tasty
almost
tasted
like
a
pale
ale
a
little
floral
or
fruity
something
going
on
some
slightly
sweet
caramel
ill
give
it
an
extra
half
point
for
that
and
interestingly
i
had
another
after
dinner
and
it
was
back
to
where
it
was
before
nothing
wrong
but
nothing
interesting
i
feel
like
trying
all
beers
with
roast
chicken
now
try
it
cheers
ale1
jupiter
fla
overall
under
hoped
even
by
an
apa
standard
overall
a
really
nice
pale
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
sampled
so
far
cheers
o
overall
an
average
drinking
pale
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
or
grabs
your
attention
think
they
missed
the
mark
here
a
light
drinking
crisp
pale
with
some
tropical
fruitiness
pineapple
mangos
kiwi
both
on
the
nose
and
flavor
might
have
been
a
bit
obvious
and
expected
but
would
of
served
much
better
the
locale
then
this
ordinary
tale
some
level
of
hop
awareness
but
the
flavor
remains
mundane
and
could
of
better
represented
o
a
decent
apa
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
see
this
one
replacing
all
the
snpa
and
headwaters
in
my
fridge
cheers
o
a
really
good
pale
ale
that
id
have
again
glad
to
see
more
kona
in
ny
overall
this
is
a
beer
you
need
to
try
me
im
going
to
stick
to
my
back
forty
naked
pig
pale
ale
this
isnt
my
forte
and
the
taste
is
just
to
underwhelming
to
be
a
repeat
purchase
a
solid
brew
but
not
one
ill
visit
often
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
first
time
i
tried
it
a
good
5
years
ago
i
avoided
it
for
the
next
4
and
then
on
a
whim
i
tried
it
again
about
a
year
ago
it
was
much
better
than
i
remember
not
my
favorite
pa
but
its
certainly
far
from
the
bottom
of
the
pack
and
it
does
have
unique
qualities
which
make
it
stand
out
from
your
average
pale
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
it
has
a
good
smoothness
with
many
nice
characteristics
early
on
in
the
pint
i
briefly
considered
drainpouring
simply
to
spare
myself
the
calories
but
once
i
decided
not
too
and
set
about
going
through
my
day
i
quickly
found
the
glass
nearempty
so
obviously
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
regardless
of
alloftheabove
o
a
decent
brew
from
hawaii
i
would
def
hav
one
again
it
is
a
good
pale
ale
this
is
a
smooth
quaffable
refreshing
enjoyable
beer
that
you
can
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
fire
rock
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
nice
little
head
that
sticks
on
top
well
smell
is
a
nice
interplay
between
caramel
malts
and
hops
that
results
in
a
fruity
sort
of
impression
yeast
esters
and
a
slight
citrus
twang
behind
it
all
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
those
rich
caramel
malts
and
a
firm
bitterness
and
slight
hop
flavor
full
flavored
for
sure
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malts
but
the
hops
stick
around
as
well
its
medium
bodied
and
has
a
hearty
feel
to
it
overall
a
well
balanced
slightly
malt
forward
but
hoppy
enough
pale
ale
quite
good
as
i
enjoy
mostly
big
beers
this
is
like
drinking
a
light
beer
now
could
make
a
decent
session
beer
for
some
i
suppose
would
recommend
it
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
did
not
scream
pale
ale
to
me
as
it
didnt
have
the
strong
hops
ive
come
to
expect
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
smooth
to
drink
and
a
solid
taste
but
nothing
flashy
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
dont
know
that
i
will
crave
it
a
good
intro
to
konas
offering
and
enough
to
make
me
willing
to
try
some
more
of
their
stuff
o
probably
wouldnt
try
this
beer
again
or
recommend
it
to
anybody
but
i
sure
didnt
mind
it
for
watching
basketball
o
pretty
damn
good
if
you
like
some
malt
in
your
pale
this
would
be
a
good
choice
and
i
feel
it
makes
this
brew
stand
out
a
little
nothing
here
to
make
this
a
must
buy
but
it
really
doesnt
have
any
glaring
weaknesses
either
a
solid
pale
ale
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
creamy
and
easydrinking
the
body
is
smooth
and
drinkable
but
slightly
watery
in
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
well
hidden
but
could
use
a
bit
more
strength
during
the
swallow
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
tasty
rendition
of
an
apa
pretty
light
on
the
hops
to
be
honest
but
the
flavor
that
it
has
is
pretty
delectable
and
i
find
that
thats
what
really
matters
in
the
end
o
quite
drinkable
sweet
with
a
nice
level
of
bitterness
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
a
solid
pale
ale
that
seems
to
bring
a
good
amount
of
malt
balance
very
good
this
is
a
case
worthy
brew
here
great
flavor
and
balance
could
drink
it
by
the
truck
load
my
first
brew
from
kona
brewing
and
i
am
very
impressed
great
stuff
a
stand
out
apa
here
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
body
no
head
but
a
little
bit
of
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
and
with
some
slight
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
of
malt
first
then
some
bitter
hops
with
a
pepper
after
taaste
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
and
i
would
drink
it
again
cheers
o
glad
to
see
kona
with
this
offering
will
try
again
overall
impression
a
very
refreshing
brew
from
kona
but
could
have
used
more
hops
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
but
still
enjoyed
have
had
before
ontap
and
wanted
to
see
if
it
reminded
me
of
the
past
time
unfortunately
nothing
rang
a
bell
enjoyed
nevertheless
and
wouldnt
mind
starting
off
the
night
with
one
of
these
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
slick
feel
across
the
tongue
a
medium
body
and
very
light
carbonation
that
is
just
above
watery
this
was
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
needs
a
hop
boost

no
length
light
unchallenging
but
would
make
a
reasonable
starter
for
the
craftbeeroskeptics
out
there
who
need
to
be
weened
off
corn
and
rice
beers
overall
i
am
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
its
kind
of
grainy
and
harsh
with
an
earthy
hop
bite
if
i
ever
try
this
again
i
might
change
my
score
i
remember
drinking
this
beer
by
the
pool
during
my
honeymoon
in
maui
however
i
think
it
tastes
a
little
better
in
paradise
not
bad
by
any
means
still
a
very
good
apa
d
not
bad
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
with
a
darker
malt
profile
than
most
pale
ales
i
grabbed
this
because
id
never
had
a
beer
from
hawaii
before
started
off
pouring
a
meager
18
offwhite
head
which
vanished
immediately
very
little
smell
at
first
only
some
mild
malt
and
not
much
more
even
after
warming
appearance
is
a
slightly
hazed
copper
or
apricot
color
taste
although
alright
was
only
marginally
more
than
a
bmc
to
me
granted
it
had
more
body
than
bmcs
anyway
its
a
plenty
drinkable
beer
and
its
cool
its
from
hawaii
but
otherwise
i
dont
really
see
anything
exceptional
to
it
good
beer
to
start
off
my
kona
variety
12pack
really
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
dr
quite
drinkable
but
also
forgettable
even
fans
of
the
style
wont
find
this
particularly
appealing
id
try
it
on
draught
but
kona
needs
to
step
up
their
game
if
they
want
to
really
make
good
beer
this
beer
was
my
2nd
on
my
vacation
it
hit
the
spot
after
a
long
day
even
if
that
does
also
mean
forgettable
a
good
tasty
pale
ale
even
flavor
and
balanced
body
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
either
a
worthwhile
brew
kona
fire
rock
pale
ale
why
drink
beer
brewed
in
hawaii
when
you
live
in
colorado
good
question
with
no
answer
the
fire
rock
once
in
the
glass
has
a
burnt
copper
color
which
is
translucent
thin
white
head
that
fades
and
just
a
whiff
of
aroma
the
flavor
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
not
much
hop
or
bitter
coming
through
hops
must
be
expensive
in
hawaii
anyway
the
fire
rock
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
my
tastes
would
prefer
some
more
hops
and
complexity
a
very
good
beer
o
eh
nothing
special
quite
a
bit
of
better
apas
to
be
found
easily
overall
good
pale
ale
noting
too
exciting
but
a
solid
pale
for
sure
tasty
but
far
less
hoppy
than
other
pale
ales
fire
rock
is
an
easy
drinker
and
pleasing
but
not
stunning
o
a
pleasant
departure
from
typical
pale
ale
could
maybe
use
a
little
more
bitterness
but
its
clean
refreshing
and
sessionable
i
reckon
itd
make
a
good
palate
cleanser
if
i
ever
am
fortunate
enough
to
find
my
self
in
hawaii
i
know
one
beer
ill
order
with
dinner
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
breadbiscuitlike
malt
and
some
subdued
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
citrus
zest
and
floral
hops
up
front
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
in
the
taste
overall
a
pretty
decent
apa
nothing
groundbreaking
just
a
good
clean
well
made
apa
recommended
o
i
normally
do
not
associate
beer
with
hawaii
but
what
the
heck
this
is
good
stuff
looking
forward
to
trying
other
kona
beers
d
very
decent
beer
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
lacking
in
hops
a
very
nice
malty
pale
ale
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
lacing
is
decent
but
nothing
too
great
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
hops
and
malts
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
the
malts
were
sweet
and
the
hops
were
lightly
citrusy
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
o
a
solid
pale
ale
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
than
many
other
american
pale
ales
ive
had
but
it
still
has
many
of
the
unpleasant
flavours
that
i
dont
like
in
my
beer
namely
apricot
grass
wheatlike
flavours
and
a
bit
of
yeastiness
the
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
its
got
some
sweet
maltiness
to
balance
it
many
pale
ales
are
light
in
colour
body
and
flavour
to
bring
out
those
nasty
hop
flavours
allowing
them
to
even
further
dominate
the
beer
luckily
this
beer
has
some
balance
on
tap
at
lisas
pizzeria
in
rodanthe
nc
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
slightly
bready
flavor
is
clean
but
complex
with
a
distinct
almost
fruity
caramel
followed
by
a
dry
but
not
overly
bitter
hop
finish
unique
tasty
and
very
drinkable
coppergold
pour
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
pale
malts
a
bit
of
bready
malts
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
flavor
is
clean
if
not
a
bit
mild
not
a
whole
lot
of
hop
character
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
maybe
im
imagining
it
but
it
does
taste
sorta
hawaiian
maybe
theres
some
pineapple
in
there
overall
not
bad
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
from
a
hawaiian
brewery
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
ale
o
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
especially
on
a
hot
day
a
fruity
but
lowhop
pa
pours
out
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
and
quickly
dissapates
into
no
head
at
all
very
bright
copper
color
shows
alot
of
carbonation
at
first
than
dies
down
rapidly
smells
very
sweet
which
throws
you
off
when
you
take
your
first
drink
and
get
the
overwhelming
bitterness
of
an
ipa
not
what
i
normally
expect
in
an
apa
this
beer
is
very
smooth
going
down
that
was
probably
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
overall
my
opinion
is
biased
based
on
the
fact
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
bitter
of
a
beer
but
if
thats
your
cup
of
tea
than
i
would
suggest
it
to
you
i
am
a
fan
of
konas
longboard
and
other
beers
so
just
shop
around
their
different
selections
overall
a
great
brew
just
not
mine
pleasantly
surprised
very
metallic
and
too
many
off
flavors
here
to
make
this
enjoyable
behind
all
of
this
i
can
taste
a
decent
pale
ale
not
something
i
would
ever
come
back
to
or
recommend
o
not
bad
woulda
liked
more
hop
character
o
a
good
apa
sweeter
with
more
of
a
malt
presence
than
the
average
apa
i
thought
there
was
just
a
bit
more
alcohol
in
this
than
what
it
was
in
actuality
it
wasnt
so
much
in
the
taste
but
in
the
warmth
that
i
could
feel
it
like
a
few
others
i
was
disappointed
to
find
out
that
konas
beers
are
brewed
on
the
u
s
mainland
but
nevertheless
this
is
certainly
worth
a
shot
since
theres
nothing
quite
like
it
on
the
shelf
at
your
retailer
those
who
like
darker
and
moderately
stronger
pale
ales
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
mild
flavors
will
delight
in
this
beer
just
like
i
did
the
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
disjointed
theme
of
the
beer
with
a
super
solid
bitterness
that
doesnt
have
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
this
could
be
a
great
beer
but
it
just
comes
up
a
little
short
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
wouldnt
come
back
to
this
apa
orangeamber
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
orange
and
mango
notes
as
well
as
some
bread
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
orange
citrus
as
well
as
some
flowery
and
perfumelike
hops
mixed
with
biscuit
malt
low
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
low
decent
bottle
marked
mar23111536
nh
the
pour
is
ambercopper
with
a
quick
fizzy
head
that
dissolves
almost
instantly
roasted
caramel
malts
and
some
light
hops
are
noted
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
thin
but
not
watered
down
there
is
a
solid
malty
character
in
the
taste
with
a
slightly
dry
hopped
ending
but
there
is
this
faint
berry
like
fruit
character
in
the
background
pours
out
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
finger
thick
head
that
takes
a
good
long
time
to
melt
with
lingering
lacing
the
smell
says
hops
with
some
hint
of
malt
behind
it
the
taste
doesnt
quite
deliver
the
promise
of
the
smell
but
is
still
pretty
good
for
a
pale
ale
nice
crisp
finish
with
a
lingering
of
hops
on
the
palate
that
makes
you
go
back
for
more
personally
my
favorite
pale
ale
is
from
another
brewer
but
would
this
stop
me
from
getting
this
one
again
or
recommending
it
definitely
not
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
so
i
can
have
more
decent
but
lacks
body
depth
better
than
the
other
regulars
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
nothing
spectacular
and
a
little
light
for
my
liking
but
certainly
worth
drinking
i
wouldnt
run
out
to
buy
more
but
i
definitely
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
this
6
pack
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
balanced
but
tame
even
for
style
i
think
kona
was
going
for
something
light
enough
for
hawaiian
summers
the
hops
are
piney
and
citric
and
there
are
definitely
enough
of
them
the
malts
are
fairly
overwhelmed
fortunately
for
drinkability
its
well
carbonated
and
finishes
clean
enough
very
sessionable
pale
ale
falls
nicely
in
the
middle
of
american
and
english
styles
ultimately
very
balanced
and
satisfying
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
presents
a
ruby
highlighted
copper
coloring
with
a
thick
smooth
foamy
white
head
the
beer
has
caramel
sweet
and
nutty
aromas
with
a
thick
cloying
character
flavors
are
dark
roasted
caramel
with
coffee
tones
as
well
no
hops
whatsoever
this
brew
is
a
bit
more
like
an
amber
to
me
the
carbonation
comes
through
at
the
end
of
the
palate
sharp
toasted
aftertaste
of
roasted
caramel
the
finish
is
sweet
and
smooth
decent
beer
stand
alone
but
within
the
style
not
overly
impressive
caramel
malt
base
with
a
tight
finish
and
some
sugary
sweetness
peppery
hop
finish
easy
drinking
but
rather
nondescript
overall
a
middleoftheroad
ale
the
balance
of
all
these
things
combines
perfectly
into
this
very
solid
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
white
head
smells
very
citrusy
and
a
lot
of
hop
in
the
nose
the
tase
has
the
same
tons
of
citrus
and
plenty
of
hops
to
go
around
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
beer
its
my
first
kona
and
i
will
be
back
for
more
for
sure
so
there
you
have
it
aromatics
are
good
each
sip
starts
out
promisingly
but
i
think
its
just
overhopped
with
an
unpleasant
variety
i
wish
for
a
nicer
creamy
carbonation
as
well
12
oz
bottle
poured
into

a
classic
pale
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
frothy
foam
but
almost
no
carbonation
visible
good
lacing
nose
is
nicely
balanced
between
lightly
sweet

and
citrusy
hops
with
a
scent
of
mango
flat
mouthfeel
makes
it
seem
heavier
than
it
should
the
palate
hits
the
right
bases
though
a
nice
slightly
roasted
and
sweet
malt
contrasts
with
clean
fresh
hops
finish
is
balanced
and
clean
overall
balanced
the
way
a
pale
ale
should
be
but
not
displaying
any
qualities
that
jump
out
at
you
moa
very
solid
easy
drinking
beer
just
like
an
apa
should
be
definitely
one
of
the
better
hawaiin
brewed
beers
that
are
available
in
bottlescans
the
beer
is
clear
copper
in
color
with

very
small
head
that
disappears
very
rapidly
smells
floral
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
floral
crisp
with
a
very
pleasant
sweetness
and
less
than
expected
bitterness
for
a
pale
ale
and
a
metallic
aftertaste
carbonation
is
on
the
lively
side
overall
less
hoppy
than
expected
but
very
pleasant
and
balanced
o
this
was
a
really
nice
apa
a
ballsy
take
on
a
somewhat
boring
style
which
is
exactly
what
id
expect
from
a
brew
made
in
hawaii
aloha
overall
it
was
an
average
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
for
some
balance
in
all
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
surfin
hawaii
or
something
not
above
many
other
apas
out
there
but
not
far
below
the
standard
worth
a
try
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
kona
i
think
certainly
the
first
reviewed
its
a
pretty
average
beer
for
the
style
there
is
nothing
offensive
but
not
what
im
really
looking
for
in
a
apa
maybe
i
got
an
older
bottle
but
this
beer
is
very
malt
forward
without
the
hop
flavor
or
mouthfeel
that
ive
grown
accustomed
to
in
the
best
apaswhich
have
bright
citrusy
hops
and
toasty
biscuity
malt
the
malt
in
this
beer
even
tastes
a
bit
oxidized
and
a
bit
too
sweetcaramelly
the
sweetness
at
the
end
of
the
beer
is
a
little
too
much
without
the
hops
o
decent
enough
pale
ale
3
5
o
the
brew
was
decent
a
little
sweet
and
i
thought
it
could
use
some
more
hops
it
is
a
brew
that
you
could
enjoy
a
few
of
hanging
out
with
some
friends
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
not
very
complex
but
there
is
at
least
something
there
to
think
about
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
the
smell
was
suble
sweet
notes
added
to
the
hoppy
backdrop
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
subtle
with
a
bitter
hop
flavor
throughout
with
the
hoppy
and
sweet
notes
the
aftertaste
wasnt
bitter
at
all
the
hops
linger
for
awhile
this
one
wasnt
very
smooth
had
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
a
good
flavor
worth
checking
out
i
was
ok
with
this
one
medium
strength
of
flavor
makes
this
hard
to
reach
for
again
it
is
ok
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
decent
drink
not
particularly
complex
or
interesting
d
this
is
a
great
apa
i
highly
recommended
it
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
a
little
watered
down
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
bitter
flavor
d
great
drinking
beer
ive
been
a
fan
of
all
of
the
kona
beers
the
beer
was
a
coppery
orange
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
smells
of
herbal
hops
toasted
malt
and
is
a
bit
lemony
the
taste
is
just
slightly
bitter
there
is
some
sweet
roasted
malt
flavors
and
piney
lemony
finish
this
is
a
lightmedium
bodied
beer
with
low
carbonation
it
has
a
nice
lingering
aftertaste
i
thought
this
was
a
well
rounded
pale
ale
the
toasted
malt
makes
it
pretty
interesting
d
nicely
drinkable
but
theres
not
much
too
this
it
appears
to
be
steady
and
well
crafted
but
theres
just
nothing
too
special
about
it
kona
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
a
cloudly
light
amber
ale
topped
with
a
dense
marbled
bubbly
off
white
foam
the
aroma
is
of
pine
and
citrus
it
has
a
smooth
soft
medium
body
that
leaves
the
mouth
dusty
it
has
a
very
mellow
flavor
thats
wooden
piny
and
a
touch
fruity
its
a
nice
solid
pale
ale
d
goes
down
very
easy
would
be
sessionable
with
a
beach
and
some
more
flavor
ending
notes
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
its
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
have
to
realize
this
is
a
pale
ale
with
mellow
hops
not
an
ipa
with
a
super
hoppy
character
well
balanced
and
more
of
a
mellow
session
beer
overall
solid
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
more
on
the
yellowish
side
with
a
small
white
head
quickly
goes
away
hops
in
the
nose
some
citrus
and
pine
notes
nothing
really
standing
out
starts
with
a
bit
oily
pine
bitterness
before
a
sweet
fruity
middle
mosty
orange
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
zest
a
modest
caramel
sweet
malt
background
before
another
little
kick
of
pine
hops
for
a
semibitter
finish
d
goes
down
easy
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
if
it
werent
so
bland
i
bet
this
is
better
on
tap
overall
this
beer
is
good
and
id
drink
it
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
several
of
them
in
one
sitting
this
had
some
good
balance
and
i
enjoyed
it
alot
very
good
drinkability
i
could
sit
by
the
pool
and
drink
this
all
day
very
nice
sessionable
beer
nothing
aggressive
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
orange
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
too
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
the
hops
are
the
strongest
flavor
in
this
brew
but
theyre
not
overpowering
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
nice
new
brew
i
tried
tonight
not
super
amazing
but
has
some
good
qualities
for
a
pale
ale
ok
beer
certainly
not
exceptional
drinkability
is
pretty
high
i
remember
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
in
hawaii
but
my
score
is
probably
based
on
it
having
to
travel
all
the
way
to
the
east
coast
probably
not
all
that
fresh
all
in
all
its
nothing
terrible
nor
is
it
really
excited
not
much
here
to
the
nose
looked
better
than
it
smells
immediately
hit
with
straw
hay
sand
flat
and
forgettable
once
again
not
much
here
its
decent
not
off
putting
just
average
dry
finish
not
much
to
this
beer
drinkable
but
forgettable
definitely
an
average
beer
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
d
this
is
a
quality
pale
ale
nice
refreshing
beer
that
leaves
you
craving
another
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
would
make
for
an
excellent
intro
brew
for
the
uninitiated
dry
feel
with
not
much
if
any
fruity
notes
2
5
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
fruit
throughout
there
was
a
variety
through
the
nose
which
only
expanded
within
the
taste
something
else
that
was
particularly
nice
to
note
was
the
balancing
from
the
hops
in
the
end
this
was
a
nice
pale
ale
despite
some
favorable
liberties
taken
with
the
addition
of
other
ingredients
verdict
i
went
in
to
this
expecting
another
average
apa
but
breweries
like
kona
are
constantly
reminding
me
that
bending
the
rules
in
brewing
beer
can
often
come
up
with
curious
and
exciting
combinations
i
recommend
this
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
something
i
found
original
hopheads
might
be
a
little
repulsed
by
the
beers
overall
sweet
tooth
but
i
imagine
that
this
will
have
more
takers
than
givers
you
shouldnt
regret
your
purchase
b
3
8
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
and
a
touch
thin
but
the
real
problem
that
im
having
is
that
it
just
isnt
a
great
beer
average
and
a
good
fall
back
in
the
case
of
a
shortage
of
good
craft
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
a
good
basic
balanced
pale
ale
this
is
a
beer
that
is
better
than
the
some
of
its
parts
astmd
and
quite
approachable
as
well
not
much
life
to
the
hops
on
the
taste
buds
either
theres
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
and
some
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
just
a
refresher
nothing
more
nothing
less
no
complexity
at
all
if
youre
at
a
resort
and
your
other
options
are
from
bmc
it
is
worth
taking
refuge
here
otherwise
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
this
beer
has
a
high
then
usual
abv
it
does
not
hit
at
first
but
toward
the
end
there
is
a
bit
of
a
smoother
warm
presence
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
little
effort
a
really
smooth
beer
d
a
very
good
go
to
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
too
interesting
but
a
decent
apa
love
to
have
this
while
chilling
outside
or
watching
football
this
beer
is
you
pretty
average
pale
ale
it
had
good
body
to
it
it
was
a
little
dry
and
bitter
tasting
but
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
choice
it
had
good
color
to
it
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
white
head
and
alright
lacing
this
is
one
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
there
are
other
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
beer
d
nothing
overly
impressive
but
it
has
decent
flavor
and
makes
for
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
the
beach
i
sure
had
my
fair
share
in
honolulu
drinkability
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
the
islands
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
doesnt
have
to
youre
in
hi
man
d
this
is
an
excellent
apa
the
key
to
this
as
with
any
apa
is
to
get
it
fresh
somehow
this
strikes
me
as
being
halfway
between
american
and
british
paleale
tastes
poured
into
a
tulip
the
color
is
a
moderate
orangecopper
with
a
slight
white
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
very
very
mild
hops
along
with
some
pale
malt
and
light
caramel
the
taste
pulls
back
so
that
the
hops
are
nearly
nonexistent
not
even
to
the
level
of
a
mild
fairly
light
feel
without
really
any
bitterness
no
off
flavors
and
the
malt
is
fairly
nice
but
not
what
i
expect
from
an
apa
drinkability
the
unfortunately
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
get
too
much
malt
in
this
pale
ale
with
almost
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
strong
malt
presence
with
a
medium
body
poured
a
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
smell
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
malty
goodness
at
first
sip
i
immediately
noticed
the
abundance
of
hop
presence
pretty
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
which
i
love
the
beer
is
not
too
heavy
and
i
could
easily
throw
back
of
a
couple
of
these
overall
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
aroma
is
floral
citrusy
sweet
has
a
mediumbodied
feel
to
it
modest
hop
bitterness
taste
is
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
i
do
think
the
carbonation
is
too
much
though
this
particular
bottle
is
seven
months
old
so
i
will
say
the
hops
may
be
more
dull
by
now
i
think
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
really
great
or
unusual
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
it
is
6
abv
not
very
heavy
but
moderate
would
probably
go
well
with
pizza
or
spicy
bbq
id
prefer
it
over
bass
but
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
is
my
preference
reddish
color
with
lacing
and
a
rim
of
foam
mild
hops
and
gentle
malt
hints
coming
off
the
nose
the
attack
is
gently
hoppy
and
there
are
some
flavors
of
the
grains
swirling
around
with
a
malty
backdrop
there
seems
to
be
some
irish
moss
or
peat
flavor
kicking
around
there
as
well
especially
in
the
aftertaste
i
must
admit
this
was
better
than
i
expected
i
have
recently
been
seeing
the
kona
stuff
at
various
places
around
the
country
and
i
was
afraid
it
was
going
to
be
some
mass
produced
swill
that
was
capitalizing
on
the
fact
it
was
from
hawaii
this
wasnt
the
case
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
purchased
some
to
try
final
thoghts
very
suprised
and
would
reccommend
to
ipa
and
pa
drinkers
and
hopheads
in
general
yeah
we
can
dig
the
whole
hawaiianstyle
complex
and
drinkable
the
hops
and
malt
mesh
very
well
together
and
show
great
balance
great
stuff
kona
from
the
bottle
the
brew
looked
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
foam
above
not
a
bad
looking
brew
really
some
flowery
notes
in
the
aroma
are
offset
by
a
dose
of
fermented
caramel
grain
the
aroma
is
played
out
on
the
palate
with
a
strong
grainy
sweetness
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
apparent
at
the
end
but
more
would
be
appreciated
to
offset
the
grains
overall
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
fairly
straight
forward
in
its
flavor
profile
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
would
have
it
again
d
i
could
probably
kill
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
saturday
afternoon
this
beer
has
average
drinkability
too
much
carbonation
and
an
odd
aftertaste
limit
it
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
beer
in
a
six
pack
but
depending
on
my
choices
i
may
order
a
pint
in
a
bar
pours
a
hazy
orangish
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
faint
toffee
and
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
some
citrus
hop
notes
over
the
top
the
taste
has
a
toffee
and
bready
backbone
on
the
back
end
there
is
a
citrus
hop
bite
with
a
slight
floral
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
solid
apa
not
the
hoppiness
of
some
of
the
bigger
apas
but
the
drinkability
is
well
blended
and
very
smooth
d
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
i
could
have
several
of
these
easily
unfortunately
as
apas
go
its
a
little
on
the
weak
side
id
like
to
see
some
more
hop
flavor
with
this
beer
that
would
push
it
into
the
very
good
territory
at
least
drinkability
this
is
probably
one
of
the
only
times
ill
grab
the
lager
over
the
pale
the
flavor
was
kind
of
all
over
the
place
and
lacked
any
real
direction
not
hoppy
but
not
smoothly
balanced
so
what
is
it
not
sure
but
at
least
its
fairly
non
offensive
d
easy
to
drink
great
rounded
beer
really
enjoyed
it
d
flavorful
and
balanced
very
drinkable
overall
b
almost
too
sweet
not
wellbalanced
could
benefit
from
more
hops
md
moderately
thick
very
creamy
soft
carbonation
no
alcohol
detected
highly
drinkable
a
bit
heavy
very
enjoyable
not
a
typical
apa
not
by
a
long
shot
too
creamy
and
not
enough
hops
but
very
tasty
nonetheless
reminds
me
of
a
yankee
candle
my
college
roommate
used
to
burn
sugar
cookie
or
something
like
that
i
dont
think
the
fire
rock
name
fits
unless
it
refers
to
lava
burning
through
a
warehouse
full
of
vanilla
beans
id
recommend
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
on
the
lake
it
is
pretty
darn
hot
right
now
i
got
this
bottle
in
a
pick6
at
the
store
an
i
think
ill
snag
a
sixes
soon
overall
not
a
mind
blowing
pale
ale
but
it
wasnt
half
bad
very
smooth
but
not
completely
bland
and
undrinkable
overall
i
had
my
doubts
about
a
beer
from
hawaii
however
it
was
a
nice
experience
first
brew
from
this
brewery
and
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
ive
gone
through
quite
a
few
of
these
since
arriving
on
the
big
island
three
days
ago
while
not
thrilling
or
particularly
special
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorites
from
kona
brewing
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
pale
ale
overall
more
british
session
ale
in
style
than
anything
excepting
the
6
points
of
booze
of
course
none
of
which
is
at
all
evident
and
given
the
mainland
partnerships
this
brewery
is
involved
in
im
not
entirely
sure
that
this
was
even
brewed
on
the
big
island
let
alone
the
50th
state
in
the
union
not
too
bad
fairly
easy
drinking
definitely
could
have
had
another
one
thanks
to
the
pleasant
taste
and
easy
mouthfeel
a
very
good
experience
for
my
first
beer
from
the
hawaiian
islands
and
looking
forward
to
more
from
kona
drinkability
is
ok
not
as
good
as
i
recall
although
the
last
time
i
had
it
i
was
on
my
honeymoon
so
it
was
probably
more
of
a
situational
impression
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
tastes
even
better
from
what
i
remember
of
my
trip
to
hawaii
in
1997
now
that
this
is
distributed
locally
i
will
be
grabbing
some
more
d
i
could
drink
a
good
number
of
these
i
think
the
flavor
goes
well
with
the
sausage
pizza
that
i
am
eating
with
it
at
6
alcohol
its
sessionable
for
me
d
a
delicious
pale
ale
well
done
kona
d
decent
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
the
taste
doesnt
exactly
have
me
longing
for
more
not
bad
but
not
a
great
pale
ale
either
used
to
just
find
this
in
hawaii
visiting
the
wifes
family
but
now
this
stuff
seems
ubiquitous
at
least
on
the
west
coast
all
in
all
not
bad
plus
i
get
to
tick
off
another
state
as
i
attempt
to
drink
around
the
world
and
the
states
of
america
clear
orangeamber
with
a
smattering
of
offwhite
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
meager
collar
a
bit
of
spotty
lace
nice
citrusy
aroma
oranges
with
a
bit
of
malt
sturdy
bitterness
mild
malt
sweetness
fruity
citrus
tangerine
and
oranges
nicely
balanced
medium
to
light
bodied
a
bit
dry
average
carbonation
decent
texture
quite
enjoyable
easy
drinking
and
nicely
hopped
for
the
price
and
quality
you
cant
miss
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
some
citrus
bite
in
the
apple
family
there
is
plenty
of
caramel
malts
in
the
beer
a
nice
earthiness
to
the
malts
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
a
touch
heavier
than
say
your
typical
lawnmower
apa
but
very
drinkable
nevertheless
there
is
a
roasted
quality
to
the
malts
that
is
also
coming
through
and
that
coupled
with
the
earthiness
and
caramels
define
this
beer
the
slight
dryness
and
hop
bite
in
the
finish
do
not
necessarily
serve
the
beer
as
well
there
is
a
combination
of
hops
going
on
here
that
are
pulling
things
in
different
directions
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
brilliant
but
very
drinkable
d
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
really
come
across
as
a
pale
ale
almost
seems
closer
to
an
amber
since
kona
is
not
regularly
available
i
was
happy
to
see
it
at
a
bbq
as
a
friend
there
is
the
brother
of
one
the
brewers
so
needless
to
say
i
was
a
bit
excited
i
had
tried
a
coffee
stout
that
was
good
a
couple
years
prior
needless
to
say
this
pale
ale
underwhelmed
on
all
fronts
sadly
enough
the
pour
was
an
average
coppery
brown
with
decent
head
lace
but
little
aroma
other
than
a
malthop
the
flavor
was
a
basic
pale
ale
a
la
bass
when
i
expected
more
simple
hops
sweet
malts
prevailed
with
nothing
else
of
note
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
bbq
just
a
let
down
the
feel
while
somewhat
crisp
bubbly
was
dry
scratch
almost
reminding
me
of
dry
grasses
while
i
would
drink
if
offered
i
would
not
go
out
of
way
to
get
again
still
within
the
expected
freshness
period
but
tastes
like
all
the
hops
are
gone
or
maybe
they
were
never
there
a
decent
beer
big
malt
and
beuatiful
but
its
just
slightly
off
with
this
weird
anise
type
of
bitterness
in
the
end
theres
too
much
candy
but
still
not
sweet
to
this
beer
label
is
different
that
the
one
shown
picked
up
a
six
pack
at
the
longs
drugstore
in
wakiki
used
a
tea
glass
rather
than
the
hotel
glass
nice
appearance
and
smell
very
fruity
nose
and
nice
lacing
and
approx
1
inch
of
head
which
dissipated
slowly
the
taste
is
pretty
good
somewhat
citrus
and
you
can
taste
the
hops
somewhat
sweeter
than
other
pale
ales
mouthfeel
is
fine
not
too
heavy
and
very
refreshing
definitely
drinkable
could
make
this
a
session
beer
paired
it
with
a
baby
swiss
and
baguette
d
fairly
impressed
with
this
hawaiian
beer
overall
kona
did
a
good
job
all
in
all
fire
rock
was
a
solid
pale
ale
tasty
with
a
solid
flavor
and
body
on
it
although
its
not
the
best
ive
had
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
with
my
choice
of
beer
on
tap
for
the
evening
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
comes
out
a
fairly
dark
copperyorange
a
two
finger
head
develops
and
is
offwhite
and
fairly
frothy
the
head
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
behind
a
light
coat
of
lacing
a
small
coat
of
white
stays
atop
the
beer
with
a
pretty
creamy
ring
smell
is
alright
i
get
mostly
notes
of
fairly
toasty
caramel
malt
and
a
breadywheatyeasty
note
if
anything
i
get
a
tiny
bit
of
earthy
hops
in
there
too
the
aroma
has
decent
strength
but
not
much
too
it
taste
is
pretty
much
the
smell
with
a
bit
more
complexity
and
some
hops
i
get
the
caramel
malts
and
the
bready
hints
the
hops
come
through
and
are
a
tiny
bit
bitter
with
grassy
earthy
and
a
tiny
bit
of
fruit
to
them
once
again
the
malt
is
the
prominent
character
here
but
it
is
a
bit
too
caramel
for
me
some
citrus
peel
from
the
hops
comes
around
once
in
a
while
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
has
a
moderate
body
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
the
creaminess
is
nice
and
helps
make
the
beer
more
enjoyable
there
is
no
warmth
but
a
coat
of
bitterness
stays
around
on
the
tongue
with
some
malt
flavor
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
was
one
of
the
cheapest
on
the
shelf
even
after
being
shipped
from
hawaii
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
there
really
are
no
bad
flavors
but
they
are
not
exceptional
if
the
malts
were
a
bit
less
caramel
and
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
present
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
wasnt
hugely
impressed
with
it
i
could
session
this
one
and
will
give
it
a
good
drinkability
rating
i
poured
this
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
i
also
noticed
it
was
out
of
date
nobody
must
drink
this
stuff
as
every
kona
product
i
have
looked
at
recently
was
out
of
date
in
every
store
i
have
looked
head
was
an
off
white
and
had
good
lacing
the
amber
colored
beer
was
bready
smelling
and
a
little
hoppy
nothing
to
smile
about
here
im
not
buying
again
f
finishes
slightly
pale
bitter
with
a
little
citrus
acidity
and
some
more
of
those
fruity
hops
a
slight
sweetness
that
seems
to
stay
but
it
also
seems
to
dry
off
a
bit
with
the
pale
bitterness
despite
all
the
nice
flavor
it
also
seems
to
have
a
nagging
off
flavor
bitterness
some
hop
characteristic
that
im
not
really
digging
or
it
seems
more
like
a
burnt
malt
bitter
flavor
that
doesnt
go
well
with
a
pale
ale
i
think
the
biggest
problem
is
the
trip
over
here
from
the
brewery
which
is
quite
a
long
trip
probably
harsh
on
the
beer
if
im
ever
over
there
ill
def
drop
in
to
try
some
fresh
not
bad
but
so
many
better
pale
ales
out
there
poured
a
copperish
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
and
good
lacing
there
was
a
slight
citris
smell
with
a
touch
of
caramel
the
hoppy
citris
taste
quickly
turns
into
a
sweeter
malty
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
and
had
medium
to
low
carbonation
overall
an
average
beer
which
has
decent
drinkability
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
malts
taste
is
good
well
balanced
combination
of
malts
and
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
drinks
oksmooth
and
a
silky
flavor
help
this
go
down
wellthe
hints
at
hops
are
nice
for
flavor
but
arent
a
block
in
the
road
for
any
drinker
the
aroma
was
an
unremarkable
blend
of
malt
and
hops
with
no
particular
highs
or
lows
the
flavor
was
the
same
not
terrible
but
not
notable
either
the
body
and
drinkability
were
both
typical
for
the
style
overall
this
a
typical
example
of
this
style
you
can
do
better
but
its
ok
for
a
plan
b
beer
d
highly
drinkable
simple
and
straight
forward
isnt
a
mad
e
thing
quite
quaffable
sip
after
sip
after
sip
definately
an
enjoyable
session
brew
nothing
extreme
about
just
an
easy
drinking
offering
from
our
island
friends
a
job
well
done
by
kona
i
would
gladly
drink
again
and
again
poured
a
nice
copper
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
finger
of
white
head
little
carbonation
and
good
lacing
the
smell
had
the
feintest
hint
of
lemon
citrus
and
was
instead
dominated
by
caramel
and
maltiness
the
taste
confirmed
this
with
the
citrus
aspect
fading
instantly
to
maltiness
midpalate
and
through
to
the
finish
this
beer
would
certainly
benefit
from
more
hop
balance
the
body
was
thinner
than
expected
given
the
smell
and
flavor
but
after
all
this
is
a
pale
ale
the
thinner
body
did
help
this
beers
sessionability
i
wouldnt
mind
sitting
down
and
throwing
a
few
back
d
not
a
bad
session
beer
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
straightforward
lacking
complexity
beer
seems
a
bit
much
to
pay
7
for
6
of
these
they
are
very
standard
easy
to
drink
and
all
these
are
something
to
give
to
non
serious
beer
drinkers
to
segue
into
something
better
pours
a
brownish
amber
in
color
with
nice
fluffy
faintly
offwhite
head
smell
is
forward
of
floral
hops
and
bready
malts
with
a
hint
of
carmel
and
pine
resin
taste
is
very
malt
forward
heavy
in
the
bread
and
carmel
department
floral
hops
take
a
backseat
and
faint
hints
of
piney
hops
as
well
medium
body
slightly
oily
feeling
more
akin
to
an
english
ipa
in
terms
of
the

slightly
hoppy

taste
is
bready
malt
profile
and
predominantly
sweet
with
a
little
hoppiness
in
the
finish
easily
drinkable
but
pretty
heavy
due
to
bread
and
caramel
d
good
over
all
but
forgettable
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
probably
would
choose
other
options
over
this
one
12
ounce
bottle
a
buddy
brought
some
island
brews
back
for
me
on
a
recent
trip
to
hawaii
served
in
a
sam
adams

the
beer
pours

about
a
half
inch

is

aroma
is
citrusy
hops
orange
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
too
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
the
hops
are
the
strongest
flavor
in
this
brew
but
theyre
not
overpowering
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
balanced
beer
not
a
bad
choice
as
an
occasional
session
brew
drinkability
seems
like
a
cross
between
an
american
pale
ale
and
amber
ale
due
to
the
malt
focus
and
restrained
bitterness
regardless
of
what
it
is
this
is
my
goto
hawaii
beer
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
slight
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
decent
pale
ale
here
d
very
good
beer
and
low
in
abv
makes
you
feel
warm
and
cozy
like
you
are
in
hawaii
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
fair
match
for
any
hot
weather
activity
fire
rock
is
probably
best
with
hot
dogs
and
coleslaw
hazy
copperorange
in
color
with
a
finger
of
slightly
off
white
head
that
quickly
thins
to
a
mere
veil
over
the
brew
theres
floral
hops
oranges
lemons
and
roasty
malts
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
smell
only
slightly
more
pronounced
the
lemon
was
also
absent
in
the
taste
this
is
a
good
sessionable
and
refreshing
beer
nothing
even
remotely
offensive
about
it
had
a
nifty
bitter
tone
at
the
finish
this
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
folks
wanting
to
get
into
craft
brews
overall
good
beer
but
when
drinking
beer
in
hawaii
what
can
be
better
anyway
cheers
try
this
on
tap
overall
its
ok
i
prefer
my
apas
to
have
more
of
a
hop
kick
to
them
than
this
one
had
worth
a
try
the
next
time
youre
in
hawaii
though
cheers
d
not
a
bad
session
could
have
several
at
a
time
with
enjoyment

also
d
not

not
quite
mellow
enough
for
a

beer
but
tasty
enough
to
have
a
couple
easy
to
drink
but
too
light
been
a
while
since
ive
had
an
apa
with
such
weak
hops
md
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
pretty
heavy
malt
taste
i
didnt
notice
any
real
sweet
taste
sine
i
thought
the
citrus
smell
was
on
the
light
side
this
was
the
last
of
a
4pack
of
brew
that
a
buddy
brought
back
for
me
im
glad
i
had
tried
it
but
wouldnt
look
for
it
in
the
future
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
one
i
would
recommend
it
but
this
brew
wasnt
there
for
me
j
pours

12
inch

good

and

the
style
of
an
american
pale

mouth
feel

with
a

good

very
satisfied

nothing
to
write
home
about
pretty
much
an
average

drinkability
solid
pale
ale
and
a
good
alternative
from
a
macro
for
beginers
ale
wtf
this
tastes
like
a
fancy
pbr
or
something
its
light
and
fizzy
but
still
ok
eck
as
i
drink
it
i
see
how
bland
this
is
skip
it
drinkability
this
is
an
average
inoffensive
pale
ale
i
like
how
the
ending
gets
sweeter
but
otherwise
nothing
jumps
out
drinkability
i
have
5
more
and
see
no
problem
putting
these
away
i
would
have
liked
more
hop
bite
in
this
beer
and
for
some
reason
dont
get
that
citrus
flavor
i
remember
from
my
first
try
after
getting
through
the
6
pack
that
citrus
flavor
appeared
more
than
i
thought
on
my
first
try
a
decent
beer
all
in
all
a
decent
hoppy
pale
ale
best
served
ice
cold
to
hide
some
mild
astringencies
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
without
a
drier
finish
and
the
carbonation
is
fine
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
pale
ale
perfect
for
an
introduction
to
hoppier
beers
in
my
opinion
as
a
complement
to
tacos
this
beer
could
does
not
work
out
so
well
virtually
no
head
which
i
will
chalk
up
to
the
establishment
light
amber
in
color
and
slightly
cloudy
the
color
was
a
little
misleading
since
it
was
much
darker
than
i
expected
for
a
pale
ale
the
smell
had
strong
hints
of
fruit
berries
mostly
and
would
seem
more
fitting
for
a
amber
ale
than
for
a
pale
the
taste
was
the
same
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
clean
and
otherwise
forgettable
finish
slightly
bready
with
a
full
mouthfeel
but
all
in
all
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
with
a
name
like
fire
rock
for
a
breakfast
beer
this
would
have
gone
better
with
fruit
pancakes
than
tacos
this
was
my
first
kona
beer
and
is
not
leaving
me
longing
to
try
the
others
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
its
a
pretty
average
pale
ale
nothing
really
spectacular
going
on
here
but
my
girlfriend
seemed
to
like
it
once
it
warmed
up
a
little
which
tells
me
this
would
be
a
good
crossover
since
she
really
only
likes
miller
high
life
and
kona
longboard
lager
d
not
a
bad
pale
ale
has
some
umph
to
it
im
feelina
kona
so
far
drinkability
a
surprisingly
good
pale
ale
i
honestly
picked
up
this
beer
just
because
it
was
from
hawaii
not
really
expecting
much
however
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
brew
and
one
i
would
highly
recommend
picked
up
a
single
bottle
from
the
party
source
in
syracuse
the
label
reads
that
the
beer
was
brewed
in
portsmouth
nh
by
red
hook
im
told
this
was
just
a
simple
pale
ale
with
fruity
crisp
hops
and
a
slightly
nutty
bread
crust
malt
flavor
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
aftertaste
is
far
too
weak
for
the
style
pale
ales
dont
need
to
knock
you
over
the
head
with
flavor
but
they
need
some
staying
power
on
your
palate
extremely
drinkable
downed
two
of
these
without
batting
an
eye
will
definitely
try
again
d
my
favorite
beer
when
i
go
to
the
islands
ive
consumed
more
of
this
beer
than
i
should
probably
admit
a
decent
ale
for
warm
weather
this
ale
lacks
complexity
and
does
not
have
a
very
distinctive
taste
certainly
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
almost
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
carapils
and
crystal
malts
there
are
some
light
bisquit
notes
as
well
hops
are
present
but
mild
in
comparison
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
moderate
bitterness
along
with
a
solid
malt
character
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
malts
used
in
this
one
its
got
a
lot
going
on
but
maybe
a
bit
too
much
for
a
simple
apa
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
it
is
bitter
enough
for
me
to
feel
sustained
for
a
short
period
and
a
color
that
is
almost
like
a
red
ale
it
has
a
nice
floral
aroma
and
the
body
is
pleasant
d
not
too
bad
i
was
slightly
surprised
and
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
medium
alcohol
and
very
well
rounded
flavors
make
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
good
session
material
more
malty
than
hoppy
gives
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
character
for
me
body
is
slightly
below
medium
with
a
slender
grittyness
to
it
thats
not
to
off
but
bothersome
in
the
first
bit
of
the
glass
virtually
simple
clean
tender
mildly
sweet
and
toasty
and
easy
going
enough
for
good
drinking
and
could
be
sessionable
enough
to
perhaps
three
or
four
d
this
beer
is
average
at
best
i
would
drink
this
over
bmc
product
in
a
heart
beat
but
would
pass
it
up
if
other
choices
were
present
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
if
i
get
again
i
will
review
it
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
citrus
hops
little
sweetness
and
a
light

a
12oz
bottle
from

winooski
vt
oelergud
pours
a
nice
dark
gold
with
a
large
head
lacing
on
the
surface
and
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
grassy
hops
taste
has
a
rounded
caramel
and
slightly
toasty
malty
sweetness
herbal
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
with
a
little
bitterness
pretty
well
balanced
not
as
strongly
hopped
as
a
lot
of
apas
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
overall
bought
this
in
a
beach
town
in
new
jersey
it
was
the
only
interesting
brand
in
the
bunch
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
i
got
it
along
with
the
pale
lager
this
was
also
better
than
i
expected
for
how
far
it
traveled
a
very
unique
flavor
that
is
both
classic
pale
ale
but
also
an
interesting
malt
flavor
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
which
is
good
because
i
bought
a
lot
notes
overall
it
is
a
nice
pleasant
but
average
pale
ale
d
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
you
could
have
a
few
of
overall
its
a
descent
beer
for
chilling
with
friends
and
really
adds
to
the
ambiance
if
your
ever
in
the
cool
beach
situation
d
nice
drinking
pale
ale
nothing
outstanding
just
really
good
drinkability
the
icedtea
feel
to
this
brew
subtracts
points
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
overall
drinkable
but
theres
other
apas
out
there
that
are
better
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
d
i
would
drink
another
one
of
these
but
i
would
also
have
no
regrets
with
moving
on
to
something
else
a
great
light
to
medium
body
really
compliments
the
flavor
of
this
brew
its
just
light
enough
to
drink
at
any
time
awesome
for
a
hot
hot
great
for
a
night
out
could
be
a
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
for
days
and
days
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
its
a
good
example
of
a
an
american
pale
ale
d
quite
a
drinkable
offering
fairly
refreshing
and
a
pretty
solid
combination
of
flavors
this
could
definitely
be
a
solid
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
notes
a
pretty
representative
apa
happened
upon
this
on
tap
at
maggie
mcflys
restaurant
in
brookfield
connecticut
this
was
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
subtle
piny
herbal
hop
and
caramel
malt
somewhat
thick
and
appetizing
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
midplus
body
feel
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
hop
blend
very
similar
to
the
aroma
add
some
vanilla
and
more
caramel
malt
maybe
even
some
banana
nut
quite
tasty
it
is
politely
carbonated
and
easily
a
sessionable
brew
a
fine
pale
ale
and
a
pleasant
surprise
poured
dark
amber
with
little
head
and
lacing
no
real
hint
of
hops
seemed
more
malty
than
anything
tasted
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
with
a
low
hope
profile
tasty
but
definitely
not
what
i
expected
in
a
pale
ale
that
being
said
for
what
its
worth
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
not
sure
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
more
up
but
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
back
yard
bbq
ontap
at
woodys
city
market
served
in
a
newcastle
pint
glass
a
crisp
orange
with
a
very
nice
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
subtle
amount
of
crisp
sweet
malts
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
citrus
and
pine
hops
balanced
nicely
with
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
for
summer
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ok
beer
but
middle
of
the
road
nothing
stands
out
and
makes
you
say
wow
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
east
ave
cafe
in
pawtucket
ri
i
was
amazed
at
the
overall
balance
of
this
beer
i
cant
mention
one
particularly
good
thing
about
this
beer
because
it
was
so
well
balanced
the
head
was
medium
sized
and
lasted
for
a
while
there
was
a
pleasing
amount
of
maltiness
with
a
little
caramel
and
the
hops
were
light
but
present
maybe
a
little
underhopped
for
some
but
well
within
the
style
guidelines
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
new
neighbor
from
across
the
street
brought
a
sixpack
of
these
over
the
other
night
poured
an
amber
color
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
smell
had
a
slightly
metallic
tint
with
some
musky
bread
taste
is
pretty
unremarkable
some
bready
and
malt
taste
almost
no
hops
prominent
which
is
surprising
for
a
pale
ale
watered
down
mouthfeel
not
a
very
good
pale
ale
drinkability
okay
this
isnt
much
of
a
pale
ale
it
needs
a
betterbigger
hop
profile
to
stand
out
a
decent
new
hampshire
brew
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
ale
from
hawaii
is
a
tasty
surprise
i
picked
it
up
from
a
local
place
just
because
it
was
from
the
west
coast
island
fortunately
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
and
a
bold
hoppy
taste
it
is
lacking
in
mouthfeel
though
it
seemed
a
bit
watery
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
either
mild
recommendation
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
slightly
off
white
head
head
retention
is
quite
good
some
thin
wispy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
caramel
malts
fruits
apples
and
possibly
pears
very
little
hoppiness
taste
is
sweet
malty
caramel
that
is
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
medium
bodied
though
slightly
thin
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easy
not
filling
its
an
average
pale
ale
with
nice
drinkability
big
carbonation
was
a
bit
much
but
still
getting
the
hops
they
did
not
skimp
and
a
tad
of
fruitiness
this
would
be
interesting
on
cask
fruity
colour
with
moderate
offwhite
head
drinkable
stuff
the
feel
is
a
thick
and
fizzy
body
dances
on
the
tongue
then
sticks
around
its
drinkable
enough
but
too
overly
bitter
for
my
tastes
without
enough
balance
the
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
would
be
nice
on
a
warm
day
and
i
feel
that
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
not
get
bored
or
palate
fatigue
i
think
this
is
a
good
average
pale
ale
that
is
drinkable
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
ive
had
worse

d
with
some
more
carbonation
this
would
be
a
damn
fine
brew
good
the
way
it
is
nonetheless
d
taste
just
wasnt
strong
enough
for
me
im
used
to
more
aggressive
apas
with
more
hops
to
them
i
guess
but
if
was
one
of
the
better
choices
at
a
bar
i
wouldnt
skip
over
it
pours
a
golden

a

a

are
also
there
this
is
one
good

this

a
pretty
darn
good
beer

pale

the
spot
on

i
tried
it
i
imagined
having
this
beer
icecold
out
of
a
cooler
at
a
busy
loud
beach
overall
next
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
almost
copper
color
with
a
thinnish
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
smells
of
grainy
malt
and
yeast
esters
a
bit
of
citrus
pokes
through
but
is
overwhelmed
taste
is
mildly
fruity
with
some
green
apples
apparent
has
a
crisp
hop
bite
citrus
and
esters
dominate
has
a
tart
finish
that
feels
out
of
place
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
but
not
quite
body
is
medium
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
not
bad
for
a
mainstream
pale
ale
but
there
are
definitely
more
flavorful
choices
out
there
drinkability
is
very
nice
nice
beer
all
told
a
good
one
to
sit
back
and
drink
on
the
porch
in
summer
there
are
a
number
of
apas
id
pick
in
front
of
this
one
though
decent
enough
pale
easy
to
see
having
more
than
a
few
mahalo
id
still
like
to
try
this
from
the
micro
in
hi
someday
of
course
if
anyone
wants
to
fly
me
out
there
im
more
than
willing
to
travel
in
the
name
of
beer
its
got
a
nice
pale
ale
flavor
not
too
strong
of
a
flavor
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
one
i
still
enjoyed
after
consuming
a
few
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
american
pale
ale
i
recommend
this
one
12oz
bottle
brewed
in
portsmouth
nh
purchased
at
hannaford
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
amber
body
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
citrussy
hops
dominate
with
a
fair
bit
of
bready
and
caramel
malts
to
balance
it
out
citrussy
minty
slightly
pithy
hops
share
the
flavor
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
balance
is
what
strikes
me
about
the
flavor
moderate
in
both
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
and
an
easy
drinker
a
solid
american
pale
ale
balanced
and
pleasant
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
overall
its
just
an
average
pale
ale
d
a
very
worthy
session
beer
i
would
order
this
at
a
bar
mouthfeel
is
that
of
above
average
tap
water
which
is
a
lot
better
than
the
soda
like
beer
you
find
at
a
lot
of
microbrews
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
just
not
outrageously
good
d
pretty
drinkable
i
think
it
would
have
been
less
drinkable
if
it
had
less
hops
in
it
but
then
i
suppose
it
wouldnt
be
called
fire
rock
overall
it
was
really
nice
pours
a
light
ambercopper
color
with
a
small
head
a
touch
cloudy
smells
fruity
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
actually
nice
aromas
coming
off
of
this
beer
toasted
malt
and
fruity
flavorsvery
nice
and
smooth
hop
flavors
are
way
in
the
background
earthy
and
citrusy
it
was
hard
to
taste
the
hops
but
the
bitterness
does
kick
in
on
the
finish
to
leave
a
nice
sweet
toasted
maltbitter
flavor
maybe
could
have
used
some
more
hop
flavor
but
that
would
make
more
like
every
other
american
pale
ale
and
i
actually
like
the
flavor
the
way
it
the
way
it
is
this
is
my
3rd
beer
from
kona
porter
and
lager
and
im
really
impressed
they
are
all
very
well
crafted
i
could
drink
these
all
day
sixer
for
7

pours
a
clear
pale
copper
color
with
a
dense
offwhite

that
slowly
settles
the
aroma
is
sweet
some
caramel
malt
perhaps
and
a
spicygrassy
hop
sweet
caramel
malt
upfront
honey
with
some
bitter
hops
in
the
end
definitely
more
of
a
malty
apa
quite
balanced
moderate
feel
little
bready
prickly
carbonation
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
decent
apa
overall
could
use
some
more
flowery
hop
flavor
drinks
easy
could
beer
to
use
as
a
change
of
pace
i
also
had
this
on
tap
and
it
tastes
exactly
the
same
this
must
mean
the
bottling
process
is
doing
a
good
job
this
could
be
a
decent
sessionable
back
up
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
something
more
exciting
meh
fairly
balanced
but
nothing
memorable
d
ill
order
it
again

overall
drinkabiity
is
good
as
this
seems
to
be
more
of
an
english

style
as
it
was
more
balanced

the
point
da

could
quaff
it

clean
taste
slight
sweet
aftertaste
but
a
little
watery
refreshng
not
much
taste
after
a
while
i
usually
go
for
the
fuller
bodied
pale
ale
but
kona
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
a
tasty
little
pale
ale
the
body
of
kona
fire
rock
pale
ale
tends
toward
the
medium
to
light
side
and
the
hops
offered
here
are
not
over
the
top
nor
are
they
very
bitter
the
galena
hops
contribute
to
a
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
fine
english
pale
ale
and
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
add
to
that
the
citrus
fruit
taste
enhancement
from
the
other
hop
varieties
and
you
have
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
its
a
good
pale
ale
choice
when
you
want
some
hops
but
dont
want
an
overwhelming
taste
of
spice
and
bitterness
drinkability
enough
body
and
flavor
to
be
interesting
light
enough
to
session
quite
tasty
overall
a
nice
fruity
example
of
the
style
that
is
wellbalanced
and
easydrinking
nothing
mindblowing
but
nothing
less
than
solid
either
something
about
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
just
irresistible
it
has
more
in
common
with
and
english
pale
ale
rather
than
and
apa
but
it
works
perfectly
up
front
are
the
toasted
malts
that
give
it
a
great
slightly
sweet
and
at
the
same
time
dry
flavor
followed
by
a
slight
hop
flavor
and
a
perfect
mouthfeel
that
makes
you
reach
for
another
sip
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
maltupfront
beers
but
the
fact
that
the
malt
in
this
one
is
not
super
sweet
and
cloying
makes
it
perfect
get
out
and
try
this
one
now
you
will
not
be
sorry
pours

peaches
perhaps
palate
is
a
mixture
of
bland
maltiness
and
hops
with
sharpness
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
positively
contributing
to
flavor
slight
fruit
mineral
taste
too
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
little
pale
ale
this
was
also
my
first
beer
from
hawaii
hopefully
not
the
last
i
have
from
that
state
either
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
and
found
out
this
beer
really
isnt
that
consistent
from
one
bottle
to
the
next
this
was
one
of
the
better
of
the
bunch
i
had
one
or
two
that
were
yeast
disasters
when
you
drink
one
i
hope
you
get
a
good
bottle
and
not
a
yeast
disaster

this
is
a
pretty
good
apa
i
really
like
how
it
is
a
little
bit
heavier
on
the
malt
than
other
apas
this
set
its
a
little
bit
apart
from
others
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
i
wont
have
another
other
comments
this
is
a
tasty
multipurpose
pale
ale
and
it
really
does
bring
to
mind
volcanoes
because
of
the
caramelized
sweetness
maybe
what
happens
when
wort
meets
molten
lava
thats
not
to
say
that
this
beer
smells
or
tastes
like
sulphur
though
clear
copper

with
a
medium
white

sweet
malt
aroma
with
a

with

not
really
much
more
to
say
about
this
beer
curse
the
250

dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
good
maybe
a
little
less
bitter
and
spicy
than
many
american
pale

but
still
a
good
representation
d
very
drinkable
beer
excellent
pale

one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
nice
crisp
copper
color
with
thin
offwhite

that
lingers
a
while
and
leaves
okay
lacing

citrus
hops
though
not
real
pronounced
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tingly
taste
is
a
nice
citrus
hop
that
slowly
evolves
into
sweet
malt
and
the
finish
is
slightly
bittersweet
and
smooth
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
pale
ale
is
highly
drinkable
hops
arent
to
strong
dont
linger
on
so
it
kind
of
leaves
you
wanting
more
sip
by
sip
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
i
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
cheers
d
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
respectable
apa
sure
theres
much
better
examples
available
out
there
but
on
the
other
hand
you
can
do
a
heck
of
a
lot
worse
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
a
definite
session
beer
but
one
may
become
a
bit
bored
with
this
after
a
few
better
than
average
ipa
that
suffers
from
a
watery
feel
the
beer
pours
dark
for
an
ipa
almost
the
color
of
an
amber
ale
on
the
other
hand
the
head
was
quite
respectable
the
nose
is
a
bit
weak
but
nicely
balanced
for
what
is
there
the
taste
has
some
nice
mild
hop
tones
with
pleasing
bitterness
theres
an
underlying
tinniness
to
the
beer
which
is
a
shame
sometimes
i
wonder
if
the
tininess
is
from
my
glassware
but
i
faithfully
took
a
sip
straight
from
the
bottle
and
got
the
same
notes
the
feel
is
really
the
least
positive
aspect
of
the
beer
theres
some
carbonation
but
it
gives
way
to
significant
wateriness
quickly
i
liked
konas
pipeline
porter
better
but
its
close
well
see
if
that
wailua
wheat
can
pull
out
a
victory
in
the
trio
of
konas
that
i
bought
flavor
had
a
nice
light
bitterness
up

with
a
moderate

quality

the

flavor
before
the
somewhat

finish
moderate

and
a
somewhat
substantial
body

the

had
this
on

at
the
cocoa
beach
pier
in

poured
a
nice

color
with
an
off

settled
into
a

leaving
behind
some
nice

nice
aroma
of
caramel
malts
and
some

is
more
on

side

im

glad
its

this
beer
has
a

it
perhaps
falls

was
an

i

it

i
would

my

with
excellent

the

being

i
am
very
happy
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
ith
no

one
of
the
best
ipas
i
have
had

was
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
zippy
carbonation

is
moderate
low

make
for
easy

but
this

becomes
boring

is
good
this
is
a
nice

light

and
easy
drinking
pale
easy
that
is
easy
to
drink
its
not
going
to
wow
you
or

this
a

having
more
than

in

a
biscuit

very

a
slightly

has
good

does
not

stand
out

a

would
turn
down

at

five

on

i
will
call

abrasive
about
this

its
at

damn
if

would
definitely
enjoy
a

of

not
really
spectacular
this
was
definitly
a
solid
offering
all
around
there
is
no
really
i
could
not
put
down
more
then
a

and
this
is
not
a
bad
offering
for
a
bbq
or
to
get
someone
into
craft
beer
a

more
i
would
go

but
not

at
all
d
a
pretty
good
beer
from
kona
easy
drinking
beer
from
hawaii
even
at
6
i
thought
the
beer
had
a
great
balance
of
hops
to
malt
to
the
citrus
flavor
and
would
recommend
d
this
is
kind
of
average
beer
when
you
get
down
to
it
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
not
the
best
a
good
surprising
even
pale
ale
that
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
good
balance
and
character
moderate
carbonation
balanced
flavors
and
medium
body
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
ale
overall
a
well
puttogether
beer
nevertheless
id
call
it
a
quality
brew
in
the
grand
scheme
of
crafts
carbonation
was
on
the
level
made
every
gulp
i
took
twice
as
large
the
beer
felt
foamy
frothy
sloshing
around
the
alcohol
never
made
itself
known
during
or
after
the
70
or
so
ounces
a
little
more
condensed
when
cold
then
warm
it
felt
just
a
little
too
thick
once
i
got
near
the
end
i
left
half
a
pour
to
sit
while
i
grabbed
dinner
when
warm
the
beer
became
much
more
salty
acidic
dont
leave
any
stragglers
drink
it
all
up

you

the

is
quite
well
hidden
so
its
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
apas
i
deeply
enjoyed
this
beer
in
fact
i
wish
i
was
drinking
one
right
now
a
surprising
flavor
and
texture
for
an
american
pale
ale
a
style
which
doesnt
usually
appeal
to
me
the
color
is
a
deep
orange
almost
rusty
shade
with
almost
no
head
but
what
i
really
enjoyed
about
this
beer
was
the
smoothness
the
hop
and
malt
flavor
is
extremely
well
balanced
the
carbonation
lends
the
beer
a
great
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
one
very
drinkable
although
the
flavor
is
a
tiny
bit
thin
and
mildly
fruity
i
thought
it
was
worlds
better
than
other
pale
ales
in
the
american
canon
sierra
nevada
springs
to
mind
this
may
become
my
new
default
beer
this
didnt
have
to
be
a
good
beer
because
it
was
from
hawaii
the
fact
that
is
is
pretty
decent
is
just
a
bonus
i
can
see
this
being
sweet
on
a
big
island
beach
d
i
think
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
beer
this
is
smooth
and
drinkable

flavor
and
bitterness
slightly
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
but
a
nice
lingering

bite
fits
the
style
perfectly
what
else
can
i
say
a
great
apa
needed
something
on
the
lighter
side
after
the
tripel
i
drank
biggest
surprise
here
was
the
color
because
it
was
one
of
the
darkest
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
would
probably
drink
again
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
22
oz
pint
glass
nice
carbonation
and
inch
thick
head
the
head
stays
for
the
sitting
a
deep
pale
color
the
aroma
is
of
a
solid
floral
hop
the
taste
is
nice
and
balanced
there
is
a
slight
bite
up
front
and
then
again
at
the
end
in
between
the
bitterness
there
is
a
great
bready
whole
grain
flavor
the
body
is
full
for
a
pa
something
i
like
to
match
a
slightly
higher
abv
5
8
this
one
i
will
try
again
and
again
the
taste
is
faint
caramelly
malt
with
a
lot
of
grapefruit
pulp
and
a
bitter
finish
it
is
very
alcoholic
which
took
me
aback
when
i
tasted
it
its
otherwise
characterless
and
has
too
little
flavour
complexity
or
body
to
carry
the
light
bitterness
or
alcohol
the
latter
seems
utterly
unjustified
in
this
instance
i
enjoyed
konas
longboard
lager
so
i
gave
the
ale
a
try
pours
a
tinged
copper
a
little
too
thin
looking
for
my
taste
but
many
many
ever
rising
bubbles
gives
it
a
decent
white
head
smells
mildly
floral
hoppy
with
pineapple
maybe
or
do
i
just
have
hawii
on
the
brain
tastes
surprising
flavorful
for
its
thin
appearance
with
decent
hop
and
malt
balance
the
tiny
bubbles
makes
it
easy
on
the
tongue
aloha
drinkability
a
good
albeit
basic
pale
ale
im
sure
itd
be
100
better
to
be
enjoying
this
beer
in
its
home
state
well
after
letting
it
warm
up
nothing
much
has
changed
id
call
this
one
a
good
entry
level
pale
ale
but
at
least
for
me
it
doesnt
have
the
flavours
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
pours
a
clear
copper
with
small
head
spotty
lacing
smell
sweet
fruity
floral
and
spicy
hops
taste
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
and
floral
and
citrus
hops
pine
and
lemon
flavors
feel
is
a
little
light
but
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
overall
i
am
glad
kona
has
come
to
florida
its
not
the
best
apa
for
real
hops
heads
but
it
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
moderateheavy
carbonation
but
not
too
stingy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
nalu
waves
printed
under
the
cap
the
fire
rock
pale
ale
from
kona
pours
an
attractive
orange
amber
color
and
a
small
rocky
white
head
nose
is
that
of
green
grapes
cantalope
oranges
and
peaches
with
gentle
hop
notes
the
taste
is
very
quick
and
to
the
point
it
rushes
in
hops
fruit
malt
gone
it
leaves
a
celery
and
pepper
like
taste
on
the
tongue
at
the
finish
again
very
straight
forward
nothing
to
complex
here
but
a
decent
show
of
the
style
none
the
less
i
wish
my
father
had
brought
me
back
more
than
one
bottle
i
could
drink
a
6
of
this
in
about
an
hour
pours
out
a
slightly
hazed
orangehoney
with
a
barelythere
head
that
leaves
some
sticky
lace
smells
of
sticky
syrupy
sweet
toasted
malts
with
some
clementine
hops
character
underneath
taste
is
about
the
same
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
the
orange
comes
out
well
though
and
i
like
that
toasty
and
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
the
body
is
moderate
in
weight
bubbles
kind
of
prick
the
tongue
average
allaround
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
but
i
dont
think
id
be
buying
it
again
there
are
better
pales
for
the
same
price
or
cheaper
available
to
me
into
a
mug
glass
this
is
a
mediumamber
colored
beer
with
excellent
lacing
despite
a
smallish
head
aroma
is
hoppy
very
citrusy
but
with
some
pleasant
malt
as
well
flavor
is
wellbalanced
with
enough
hoppy
flavor
for
a
pa
though
bitterness
is
perhaps
a
tad
on
the
low
side
lightly
fruity
and
nicely
malty
with
a
neutral
finish
body
is
a
tad
thin
but
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
great
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
on
tap
if
i
can
find
it
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
session
beer
good
flavor
and
nothing
off
pours
a
hazy
yellow
orangeish
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
grapefruity
citrusy
hop
in
the
taste
somewhat
watery
and
a
small
semidry
grapefruity
hop
a
smooth
and
watery
mouthfeel
and
a
semidry
maltiness
in
the
aftetaste
kinda
watery
good
aroma
and
color
ok
pale
but
nothing
too
exciting
drinkablity
a
tame
ale
but
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
big
big
lasting
head
all
the
way
to
the
end
with
nice
lacing
to
boot
big
juicy
caramelly
aromatic
sweetness
with
light
hops
in
the
smell
taste
consists
of
a
quite
nice
hop
presence
along
with
some
good
sweetness
to
go
along
with
it
quite
a
flavorful
pale
balanced
and
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
just
what
i
hoped
for
overall
very
good
and
one
i
wish
i
could
get
here
the
beer
poured
a
yellowish
clear
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
mainly
hops
not
bad
but
just
average
the
taste
was
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
about
average
for
an
apa
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
one
dimensional
but
not
hard
to
drink
very
drinkable
beer
though
much
less
hop
aroma
and
taste
than
from
a
keg
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
solid
carbonation
i
really
cant
argue
with
the
mouthfeel
at
all
as
it
flows
down
easily
however
overall
for
me
this
pale
ale
didnt
make
the
cut
it
lacks
the
hop
presence
i
would
normally
look
for
and
the
malts
seem
a
bit
muddled
with
the
buttery
aspect
in
there
ill
pass
next
time
d
it
is
an
easy
brew
that
is
very
session
friendly
but
quite
unremarkable
this
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
nice
head
head
was
average
thickness
slowly
faded
away
smell
was
kind
of
fruity
taste
a
little
like
a
spiced
apple
juice
i
really
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
also
had
a
bite
nice
well
rounded
beer
drinkability
was
enough
for
me
to
drink
again
d
ok
beer
for
the
beach
but
lacks
hop
flavor
to
make
this
beer
a
repeat
for
me
nothing
more
than
average
bottle
from
albertsons
in
tehachapi
ca
the
beer
is
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
has
decent
retention
stringy
lacing
lightly
floral
hops
aroma
with
some
grass
and
malt
medium
smooth
body
with
a
moderately
hoppy
character
grainy
malt
flowers
and
some
citrus
flavors
are
present
the
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
slight
citrus
aftertaste
above
average
overall
flavor
is
bigger
than
expected
toasted
and
caramel
malts
more
grassy
hops
with
a
lite
pinecitrus
finish
bigger
body
than
expected
from
a
brew
from
hawaii
really
pretty
good
ive
had
this
beer
probably
810
times
over
the
last
few
years
and
writing
this
review
makes
me
think
it
should
probably
be
part
of
a
bigger
rotation
d
nice
balance
but
too
rich
to
session
a
worthwhile
brew
light
bronze
color
topped
by
a
creamy
head
its
right
there
with
many
of
the
hooped
apas
with
its
citrus
flavors
but
a
little
lighter
in
taste
presumably
to
cope
with
the
warm
climate
it
hails
from
the
smooth
feel
is
a
welcome
addition
and
is
wraped
up
with
a
dry
bready
finish
to
my
knowledge
this
is
the
first
hawaiian
beer
i
have
hadpoured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
lighter
copper
with
a
tight
formed
12
white
head
that
settled
into
a
somewhat
frothy
mass
very
light
aromas
i
did
get
a
little
spike
of
piney
hop
at
bottle
opening
but
it
faded
quickly
to
just
a
hint
of
tasted
maltvery
balanced
pale
here
a
big
toasty
cereallike
malt
presence
up
front
with
a
touch
of
caramel
that
melds
into
a
pineycitric
finish
that
lingers
nicely
a
balanced
pale
ale
that
is
food
friendly
went
well
with
a
pizza
with
spicy
saucenot
over
the
top
flavor
wise
but
very
quaffable
highly
drinkable
session
beer
from
kona
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
pours
a
pillowy
head
but
dissapated
quickly
almost
amber
in
color
flavors
of
malts
and
hops
come
out
if
warmed
slightly
tastes
really
nice
with
some
nice
hoppy
goodness
with
a
cherrylike
malt
on
the
front
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
try
to
seek
out
whenever
possible
d
very
high
a
solid
pale
ale
thats
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
12
oz
bottle
marked
august
2006
brought
back
from
hawaii
september
2006
enjoyed
now
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
cloudy
amber
with
some
copper
tones
topped
with
a
rich
strawcolored
head
nose
is
initially
hops
which
quickly
gives
way
to
rich
caramel
which
dominates
thin
but
pleasingly
smooth
and
creamy
body
flavor
profile
dominated
by
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
grassiness
and
biscuit
and
snappy
grassy
finish
fairly
sweet
and
singleminded
but
very
refreshing
and
pleasing
good
body
and
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
interesting
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
hoppy
ale
this
one
should
not
be
on
your
list
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
refreshing
apa
with
a
balance
and
a
distinct
malt
taste
this
is
the
one
for
you
different
label
than
picture
but
bottle
says
its
6
and
according
to
here
its
5
8
maybe
they
rounded
up
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
some
orange
tones
and
a
2
finger
head
that
quickly
decipates
but
leaves
some
behind
for
the
remainder
of
the
glass
initial
smell
i
notice
is
hops
but
after
another
check
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
to
it
as
well
malty
taste
nice
mix
of
toasted
grains
and
hops
as
well
at
first
this
seemed
very
hoppy
in
nose
and
taste
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
malt
and
caramel
came
out
low
carbonation
leads
to
an
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
the
carmel
malts
dominate
the
palate
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hop
slight
bittering
on
edges
of
the
tongue
the
carmel
maltiness
really
controls
thoughout
never
approaches
cloying
but
a
malt
oriented
pale
ale
in
the
final
analysis
the
lack
of
hops
prevents
me
from
wanting
another
dvery
good
two
at
the
bar
while
waiting
for
my
table
and
two
more
with
dinner
i
liked
the
color
of
this
reddish
with
a
nice
white
head
it
smelled
pretty
good
sweet
hoppyness
to
it
nothing
complex
but
good
malty
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
hops
i
would
guess
cascade
i
liked
the
flavor
and
it
went
well
with
my
steak
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
crisp
carbonation
but
not
over
the
top
no
complaints
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
before
and
enjoyed
it
each
time
since
i
had
a
large
serving
it
did
warm
as
i
put
it
down
but
even
when
the
temp
came
up
it
had
a
good
flavor
i
can
imagine
a
better
serving
device
then
the
straight
walled
monster
mug
would
bring
out
more
character
i
can
see
this
beer
being
my
favourite
everyday
beer
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
actually
tastes
better
than
when
i
had
it
on
tap
in
kona
i
was
very
surprised
to
find
it
at
global
foods
in
st
louis
copper
color
with
a
fair
antique
head
smell
is
typical
hopforward
pale
taste
is
maltier
than
expected
with
traces
of
honey
and
vanilla
unfortunately
a
bit
coppery
at
the
finish
but
by
no
means
a
deal
breaker
this
sits
nicely
on
the
palate
but
is
a
bit
sticky
and
is
indeed
a
very
drinkable
drink
there
is
a
pronounced
citrusfloral
hop
aroma
comes
from
the
liberal
amounts
of
galena
cascade
mt
hood
hops
added
to
each
brew
overall
a
good
tourist
beer
or
1
to
break
you
into
the
apa
style
a
decent
offering
worth
checking
out
d
a
great
tasting
pale
ale
so
well
balanced
and
this
version
deserves
its
place
among
the
top
american
pale
ales
d
if
youre
in
this
kind
of
mood
you
could
probably
really
go
on
this
stuff
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
at
least
try
it
especially
if
you
find
it
ontap
overall
impression
nice
drinkable
beer
good
combination
of
flavors
d
a
very
nice
apa
it
is
the
best
of
the
3
kona
beers
that
i
have
tried
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
doesnt
have
the
best
retention
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
not
a
very
strong
aroma
but
not
bad
this
beer
features
a
nice
malty
caramel
presence
that
temporarily
gives
way
to
some
herbal
and
citrusy
hops
only
to
finish
with
more
malt
nicely
balanced
beer
those
that
prefer
heavily
hopped
apas
may
be
disappointed
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
but
not
bad
definitely
wouldnt
mind
putting
a
few
of
these
back
on
the
hawaiian
islands
a
solid
beer
thanks
to
noxious26
for
the
bottle
nice
smooth
and
easy
going
pale
ale
a
touch
hoppy
perhaps
a
different
variety
of
hops
herbal
or
pine
thrown
in
for
half
of
the
pitch
would
balance
it
out
nicely
while
maintaining
the
backbone
still
the
best
beer
i
had
on
maui
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
dfh
tulip
pint
glass
appears
a
cloudy
orangeapricot
in
color
with
a
frothy
2finger
head
pretty
dense
looking
beer
the
foam
thins
out
over
time
but
leaves
a
nice
film
on
top
of
the
liquid
not
much
lace
left
on
the
glass
though
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
yeastiness
and
nuttiness
as
well
somewhat
biscuity
maybe
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
no
real
hop
presence
though
in
the
bouquet
at
all
the
taste
echoes
the
aroma
rich
and
malty
this
is
kind
of
like
an
old
chub
junior
but
that
is
a
weak
weak
comparison
and
i
know
it
smooth
malty
taste
slightly
thin
but
refreshing
some
woody
nutty
flavors
and
the
faintest
hint
of
strawberries
slight
hop
kick
right
before
the
finish
which
is
nice
for
balance
but
otherwise
unimpressive
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
beer
was
almost
6
abv
because
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
nicely
on
the
whole
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
much
better
than
the
kona
golden
wave
ale
i
tried
before
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
pipeline
porter
still
a
solid
session
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
kona
beers
seems
to
have
a
unique
flavor
and
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
i
like
it
12

the
beer
came
with
a
nice
amber
body
and
a
slight
white
head
leading
to
solid
lacing
on
the
sides
the
aroma
was
a
bit
of
citrus
slightly
sweet
and
touch
earthy
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
the
malty
sweetness
and
a
good
hop
bitterness
that
leaves
a
pleasant
taste
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
solid
and
makes
for
drinkable

beer
this
lil
brew
sure
traveled
a
long
way
for
me
and
im
glad
it
did
try

possible

in
melbourne
fl
i
drank
the
whole
sixer
during
my
stay
and
enjoyed
every
bottle
very
sharp
and
crisp
mouthfeel
though
perhaps
a
little
thin
overall
an
excellent
choice
and
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
tried
on
tap
at
least
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
from
a
bottle
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
wtih
an
offwhite
head
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
was
of
hops
with
some
fruit
and
citrus
and
is
very
mild
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
slighly
bitter
finish
enjoyaable
to
drink
drinkability
despite
some
of
the
harsh
flavors
i
rather
like
this
beer
and
its
peculiar
complexities
mouth
strong
mouthfeel
right
off
the
bat
lots
of
good
hops
touched
up
w
more
flavors
of
cinnamon
bitter
hop
flavor
thats
kind
of
tingly
remaining
in
the
mouthfeel
graham
cracker
taste
w
banana
notes
and
brown
sugar
i
had
on
tap
and
it
was
a
dark
amber
color
that
had
a
creamy
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
smell
was
strong
and
sweet
with
a
touch
hops
and
honey
taste
was
good
not
to
strong
and
not
to
thin
i
drink
this
ale
often
as
it
is
priced
right
and
easy
to
find
on
the
space
coast
i
also
find
it
in
a
lot
of
pubs
and
restaurants
in
the
area
and
notice
a
big
movement
with
it
its
an
obvious
pleasure
drink
one

this
pours
with
little
head
but
maintains
an
invitingly
beautiful
copper
color
the
initial
aroma
hints
of
its
citrusy
hoppiness
although
pretty
it
has
a
light
texture
the
taste
is
wonderfully
tart
excellent
american
pa
i
like
how
in
hawaii
the
pronounce
it
paley
aley
prost
an
amber
color
that
fades
to
a
light
orange
with
very
little
evidence
of
a
head
very
malty
fragrance
with
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
right
at
the
end
of
each
scent
that
malt
is
just
as
strong
in
the
flavor
a
mild
bitterness
comes
in
halfway
and
takes
over
til
the
very
end
a
medium
bodied
feel
leaving
a
slght
bit
of
dryness
on
the
palate
i
fairly
disappointed
i
was
expecting
an
apa
instead
this
is
closer
to
an
english
style
pale
ale
it
is
still
fairly
drinkable
ill
slip
some
to
my
miller
lite
buddy
and
see
what
happens
it
was
a
nice
to
find
this
under
the
tree
with
a
kona
sampler
pack
schlepped
back
from
the
islands
by
the
inlaws
this
was
solid
pale
ale
i
will
definetly
try
it
again
rich
and
sweet
what
my
wife
wishes
i
was
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
the
outback
on
oahu
we
went
to
the
kona
brewing
pub
in
hawaii
kai
but
settled
on
buying
tshirts
because
it
was
1100
in
the
morning
extremely
gorgeous
carmelorange
color
in
the
glassand
this
was
one
of
those
great
frosted
mugs
huge
head
that
lasted
like
suds
through
the
first
half
of
the
mug
and
brought
a
bite
of
hops
and
a
rich
malty
sweetness
to
the
mouth
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
ordered
it
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
one
of
those
beers
that
ill
consider
at
least
on
tap
any
time
anywhere
its
available
the
sweetness
was
not
cloying
but
rather
a
welcome
balance
to
the
prominent
hops
flavor
excellent
ono
brah
md
medium
boded
bitter
light
carbonation
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
maybe
something
a
little
more
exotic
being
from
hawaii
i
feel
like
the
tried
to
take
the
notch
up
one
more
on
the
classic
american
pale
but
something
did
not
quite
work
mostly
clear
on
the
pour
with
a
rather
bright
orangishamber
color
the
head
is
slightly
offwhite
and
somewhere
between
bubbles
and
foam
lacing
was
present
but
minimal
citrus
and
caramely
malts
were
the
main
notes
to
hit
my
nose
with
a
sort
of
balance
that
carried
through
to
the
taste
pretty
hoppy
from
the
start
but
not
at
the
expense
of
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
good
though
a
bit
oilier
than
i
expected
still
i
wouldnt
turn
down
this
apa
most
any
time
this
is
a
fine
interpretation
of
a
classic
apa
it
is
wellbalanced
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
the
alcohol
was
wellcovered
nothing
particular
wowed
me
and
i
was
considering
a
3
5
for
flavor
but
decided
especially
after
another
that
is
just
makes
the
higher
score
because
while
the
taste
is
mild
it
is
nice
and
has
some
complexity
to
it
i
recommend
this
one
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
wellbalanced
pale
ale
hazy
copper
body
is
topped
by
a
small
beige
head
nice
lacing
subdued
aroma
features
citrusy
grapefruit
caramel
and
a
hint
of
pine
medium
body
with
strong
carbonation
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
citrusy
and
pine
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
caramel
maltiness
a
very
drinkable
american
pale
ale
that
while
not
outstanding
is
quite
respectable
head
on
this
one
is
fairly
scant
aroma
and
taste
are
both
pretty
average
but
very
good
smooth
caramel
malt
and
hops
which
arent
too
aggressive
worth
a
try
quite
good
easy
session
beer
i
would
happily
drink
again
especially
on
a
90
degree
plus
phoenix
fall
day
overall
a
very
drinkable
apa
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
made
this
one
unique
a
solid
pale
ale
offering
with
more
than
enough
hopping
a
bit
more
and
this
would
qualify
as
an
ipa
a
very
classic
hop
and
malt
balance
with
a
bit
of
resiny
bite
to
the
hops
smooth
finish
wiht
a
touch
of
creamyness
to
the
mouthfeel
i
bought
this
for
the
novelty
of
adding
hawaii
to
my
list
of
states
sampled
but
i
would
buy
this
again
for
the
quality

pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
creamy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
fresh
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
malt
taste
is
a
bit
more
malty
than
the
smell
but
there
still
is
a
good
layer
of
hops
in
the
background
making
it
really
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
and
creamy
good
craft
beer
in
hawaii
i
never
would
have
thunkoverall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
in
the
future
definately
recommended
overal
quite
drinkable
certainly
one
of
konas
better
offerings
i
had
this
beer
with
some
nice
fried
chicken
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
light
lace
it
has
a
light
sweet
hops
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
it
has
nice
hops
spiciness
and
a
sweet
finish
the
feel
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
evening
clean
and
light
with
a
good
flavor
d
quite
quaffable
but
doesnt
really
draw
me
in
had
this
one
directly
after
a
deschutes
this
one
had
a
good
initial
bite
of
hops
it
demured
to
a
grassychalky
backbone
afterward
not
bad
worth
drinking
with
a
pizza
and
watching
wsop
finished
very
clean
drinkable
in
a
hanging
out
and
talking
hit
kind
of
way
the
flavor
is
a
fairly
nice
blend
of
hops
and
blended
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tangy
i
think
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
pretty
drinkable
could
down
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
more
if
it
werent
for
the
residual
sweetness
after
the
hop
bitterness
finish
is
very
clean
and
aftertaste
is
minimal
alcohol
content
is
relatively
high
but
since
when
was
that
a
problem
i
guardedly
recommend
this
beer
try
it
you
just
might
like
it
in
the
bottle
i
thought
it
went
a
bit
flat
and
thin
too
quickly
tried
it
last
night
on
tap
and
was
quite
impressed
the
body
stood
up
better
throughout
the
durration
of
the
glass
creamy
bready
rich
and
full
from
start
to
finish
caramel
toasted
sweetness
balances
with
spicy
american
hops
a
tough
of
ginger
and
nutmeg
the
head
retention
and
carbonation
remained
consistently
firm
a
much
better
experience
with
this
beer
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
mild
abv
with
a
pleasant
flavor
probably
tastes
even
better
where
its
brewed
while
on
vacation
definetly
worth
tasting
and
reasonably
priced
in
the
us
mainland
that
is
cheers
had
a
pint
at
cheeseburger
oasis
at
the
alladin
hotel
in
vegas
dont
know
if
it
was
the
105
degree
weather
or
the
beer
but
i
thought
this
one
was
a
winner
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
no
head
at
least
not
in
the
frosted
beer
mug
light
lacing
good
hops
smell
great
taste
of
bitter
hops
and
spices
this
is
not
a
hops
bomb
but
has
enought
bite
to
satisfy
a
hop
head
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
harpoon
mouthfeel
was
fairly
rich
not
at
all
watery
drinkability
is
good
both
with
food
and
as
a
sessions
beer
i
had
this
one
with
the
fish
tacos
but
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
would
like
to
try
this
again
in
a
climate
below
boiling
to
see
if
i
went
overboard
on
this
one
maybe
ill
have
to
go
to
hawaii
da
good
pale
ale
easy
drinking
and
more
are
welcomed
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
not
at
all
what
i
expected
given
its
price
point
and
availability
theres
a
good
chance
ill
have
kona
fire
rock
pale
ale
again
it
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
especially
for
the
summer
season
average
feel
with
some
softness
of
carbonation
about
as
it
should
be
overall
a
notable
pale
ale
and
with
the
added
novelty
of
being
from
hawaii
i
can
say
that
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
even
if
it
doesnt
require
a
whole
lot
of
thought
very
drinkable
great
session
ale
when
freshi
highly
reccomend
this
a
very
well
put
together
pa
or
as
theyd
say
on
the
big
island
onolicious
had
a
pitcher
of
this
on
tap
with
some
friends
tonight
it
was
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
taste
is
pretty
good
it
is
a
bit
sweet
as
other
reviews
have
mentioned
but
i
dont
find
that
a
bad
thing
in
this
brew
the
hops
were
predominant
as
would
be
expected
and
there
was
a
nice
malt
backbone
i
thought
this
was
a
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
pale
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
12
ounce
bottle
pkgd
on
may2505
many
thanks
to
mentor
for
the
wedding
present
i
would
welcome
trying
this
on
tap
as
i
think
this
would
even
be
better
nice
brew
and
the
best
ive
tried
from
the
islands
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
the
taste
is
like
no
other
pale
ale
that
ive
had
there
is
something
really
fruity
about
it
much
like
sweetened
hops
or
almost
pinapple
which
would
work
with
the
hawaiian
connection
this
puts
the
beer
in
a
novelty
category
and
away
from
other
serious
microbrews
but
still
it
has
a
lot
of
character
this
goes
down
really
easy
but
its
still
hard
to
enjoy
more
than
one
color
me
impressed
i
was
a
little
skeptical
as
hawaii
obviously
hasnt
made
much
of
a
dent
in
the
brewing
industry
if
only
for
financial
reasons
this
brew
proves
that
kona
bc
means
to
do
business
and
they
do
it
very
well
what
a
great
find
id
love
to
try
their
ipa
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
flat
white
head
that
tapers
off
but
sticks
around
good
bouquet
pine
and
lemon
zest
with
light
notes
of
honey
the
taste
is
decent
with
some
bidder
citrus
tones
a
touch
of
coriander
spice
and
some
but
it
really
lacks
depth
and
aggressiveness
pretty
oily
in
the
mouth
but
not
excessively
so
crisp
and
refreshing
almost
like
you
were
chewing
wood
with
teatree
oil
at
the
very
end
thought
without
the
numbing
effect
still
not
quite
bold
or
interesting
enough
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
golden
orange
hue
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
nose
is
biscuity
malt
with
a
touch
of
buttery
diacetyl
blended
with
a
strong
aroma
of
fresh
citrusy
hops
the
same
biscuity
malt
that
was
present
in
the
aroma
comes
across
in
the
taste
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
peppery
hops
with
notes
of
fresh
grapefruit
follow
and
leave
a
bitter
aftertaste
a
bit
heavier
on
the
malt
than
i
was
anticipating
but
certainly
enjoyable
nonetheless
amazing
balance
very
tasty
hop
flavor
this
is
a
standout
pale
ale
not
terrifically
complex
but
sometimes
a
simpler
more
minimal
beer
is
more
to
my
liking
this
would
be
my
regular
drinkin
beer
if
i
lived
on
hawaii
nice
hazy
copper
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
nutty
munich
sweet
caramel
malt
followed
by
a
light
floral
hop
good
malty
flavor
with
significant
hop
bitterness
and
mild
hop
flavor
and
yeast
frutiness
the
beer
has
decent
body
and
handles
the
6
pretty
well
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
well
made
it
could
be
slightly
better
balanced
and
rides
a
fine
line
between
apa
and
ipa
this
is
not
a
bad
pale
ale
one
that
being
from
hawaii
probably
sells
for
a
fair
amount
of
the
time
on
that
fact
alone
a
very
solid
beer
though
that
is
pretty
drinkable
id
reach
for
one
again
i
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
oregonbrewed
ale
one
night
while
i
was
visiting
my
friend
in
honolulu
this
is
review
from
my
notes
it
looks
terrific
a
1
122
finger
frothy
head
sits
atop
the
deep
and
rich
dark
copper
body
the
aroma
is
largely
grapefruit
with
caramel
and
sweet
malts
the
carbonation
is
fine
but
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
for
a
pale
ale
this
beer
is
fruity
not
necessarily
tropical
but
a
bit
more
tropical
than
the
normal
citrus
profile
and
earthy
maltsweetness
tastes
strange
if
the
malt
flavors
were
bigger
the
beer
would
be
excellent
well
it
would
be
interesting
now
if
the
malts
were
more
pronounced
and
it
had
more
hop
bitterness
then
this
beer
really
would
be
excellent
as
it
stands
this
stuff
is
a
bit
bland
and
too
thin
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
not
a
bad
pale
ale
by
any
means
its
just
frustrating
since
it
could
taste
so
much
better
id
recommend
it
and
id
be
happy
any
time
i
see
it
served
appearance
is
a
nicely
transparent
orange
color
with
ivory
foam
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
composed
of
brown
sugar
fruit
and
citrus
hops
initial
taste
continues
the
lemon
and
orange
theme
plums
are
detected
midway
the
body
is
medium
to
thin
with
a
finish
that
disappoints
this
beer
needs
some
work
to
improve
the
overall
consistency
i
like
this
beer
and
would
encourage
those
of
you
who
like
the
flavors
of
hops
to
give
it
a
try
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
medium
apricot
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
and
floral
lots
of
hop
presence
theres
some
underlying
malt
but
im
loving
the
hops
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
at
first
but
then
theres
a
nice
rush
of
citrusy
hops
lots
of
citrus
going
on
here
especially
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
for
a
pale
ale
and
the
drinkability
is
great
a
nice
solid
pale
ale
thanks
to
kev
or
chris
i
cant
remember
which
dammit
for
this
fine
brew
incidentally
it
also
goes
very
nicely
with
kuaainas
excellent
bacon
avocado
burger
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
on
the
west
coast
very
easy
drinker
but
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
depth
konas
fresh
floral
and
citrusy
hops
are
evident
in
the
nose
as
you
admire
its
darkgoldamber
body
and
frothy
vanilla
head
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
malty
however
but
its
nicely
balanced
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
the
bitterness
is
solid
enough
to
balance
its
lightly
bready
malt
and
it
lingers
a
bit
in
the
finish
with
a
smattering
of
citrusy
and
floral
hop
flavors
quite
nice
goes
down
clean
but
not
my
first
choice
of
pale
ale
if
available
editi
had
this
from
a
bottle
not
ontap
overall
impression
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
get
the
hawaiian
style
bit
it
has
a
slight
tropic
fruit
edge
enjoyed
it
greatly
my
first
beer
from
hawaii
didnt
get
to
try
any
of
these
when
i
was
actually
on
the
islands
as
i
was
too
young
then
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
nice
mellow
citrus
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
nice
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
good
hop
character
and
nice
malt
backing
very
nice
the
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
half
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
there
is
some
nice
caramel
sweetness
and
a
really
nice
citrus
and
earthy
hop
i
have
some
high
hopes
for
this
the
flavor
is
nice
very
spicey
hop
profile
almost
peppery
the
caramel
sweetness
from
the
caramel
malts
is
also
nice
to
balance
the
hops
i
like
it
the
feel
is
nice
and
moderate
to
thick
and
creamy
nice
again
overall
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
could
easily
be
a
nice
session
apa
for
me
good
solid
beer
drinkability

its
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
so
if
you
dont
like
that
then
stay
away
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
the
great
state
of
hawaii
it
is
very
thick
and
creamy
and
went
down
in
gulps
drinkability
is
good
a
typical
west
coast
pale
with
the
strong
hop
flavor
you
would
expect
the
brew
get
very
mellow
as
you
drink
it
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
i
have
returned
to
it
on
several
occassions
but
is
is
not
top
of
its
class
ive
had
this
both
on
tap
and
in
bottle
on
several
occasions
a
love
affair
with
the
hawaiian
islands
i
guess
theres
not
a
lot
of
difference
between
the
two
i
think
the
tap
version
is
a
little
more
mellow
the
edges
not
quite
so
hard
drinkability
a
pretty
nice
pale
ale
if
you
want
something
with
a
bit
less
bite
than
sierra
nevada
grap
this
one
for
a
try
could
be
a
good
session
beer
light

come

you
wanna
lay
me
pass
the
poy
mahalo
its
just
a
travesty
that
the
tap
version
is
so
good
and
the
bottles
suck
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
malty
hoppy
and
just
plain
good
id
love
to
drink
it
ontap
as
fresh
as
possible
of
course
that
would
necessitate
a
trip
to
the
islands
a
sacrifice
that
id
be
willing
to
make
for
the
good
of
my
vocation
head
is
small
pale

dense

it

at

orangy

predominantly
sweet
with
a

in

easily

pretty
interesting

for
a
pale
ale
thanks
to
a
friend
for
bringing
me
back
beer
from
hawaii
instead
of
a
dancing
hula
girl
pours
a
nice
dark
orangecopper
color
with
a
dissapointing
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
smell
is
dry
and
full
of
citrus
flavor
hint
of
nuts
as
well
maybe
dried
apricots
as
well
the
taste
a
little
to
bland
not
enough
kick
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
tongue
the
almond
aftertaste
is
present
lemon
citrus
flavor
brings
up
the
rear
ever
so
slightly
a
lightmedium
bodied
pale
ale
an
average
beer
but
plenty
of
better
pale
ales
out
there
maybe
the
beer
to
introduce
others
to
the
world
of
beers
i
would
rate
this
the
starter
beer
for
new
beer
advocates
pours
a
lightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
tan
head
that
disappears
after
a
bit
there
is
a
hoppy
aroma
of
candid
citrus
fruit
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
sweetish
with
a
nice
toasted
biscuits
and
malt
flavor
up
front
this
beer
finishes
with
a
solid
hop
flavor
and
a
nice
sharp
bitterness
i
get
notes
of
toffee
orange
hay
tropical
fruit
and
herbs
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
spicedup
version
of
a
cooldown
beer
the
beer
as
it
evacuates
the
12
ounce
brown
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
the
head
is
portly
in
size
spumescent
in
texture
and
the
color
a
bright
white
with
the
lace
a
satin
like
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
crisp
and
clean
to
the
senses
with
the
start
sweet
nicely
malted
and
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
the
acidity
mild
at
the
finish
and
the
hops
personable
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
a
nice
drinking
beer
that
just
fits
the
100
degree
temperature
today
good
drinking
pale
rather
in
the
english
style
as
opposed
to
the
usual
nw
pale
a
good
drinker
would
like
a
little
less
sweetness
in
the
finish
however
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
shows
moderate
hops
and
a
good
balance
nothing
huge
in
the
flavour
department
but
instead
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
tastes
great
in
a
hot
climate
i
like
the
interesting
esters
in
the
mehana
pale
ale
but
this
beer
is
more
true
to
form
pours
more
of
an
amberorange
with
a
flaccid
white
bubbly
head
that
recedes
rapidly
nice
color
though
aroma
is
tangypiney
hops
up
front
with
a
thick
bready
backbone
the
taste
is
well
rounded
with
toasty
sweet
malts
dominating
before
a
dry
and
citrusy
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
chewy
with
a
slight
oily
texture
that
makes
it
a
winner
with
spicy
meals
drinkability
is
absoutely
tops
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
new
fave
this
drinks
a
bit
more
like
an
amber
than
a
pale
but
i
really
like
the
sweet
smoothness
and
balance
the
beer
has
a
darker
look
than
the
average
pale
a
slight
amberish
tint
to
it
the
head
was
ok
but
quickly
went
away
with
no
lacing
the
smell
was
very
strong
of
hoppy
floralness
the
taste
was
mild
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
malt
not
overpowering
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
very
small
not
much
there
over
all
an
ok
beer
i
blinked
and
the
head
was
gone
no
lacing
but
the
beer
sure
is
a
perty
color
a
light
orange
slightly
red
pleasant
aroma
tastes
bitter
but
not
too
not
very
complex
odd
aftertastes
hard
to
place
definitely
a
decent
beer
but
theres
just
not
more
to
it
orange
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
floral
a
medium

pale

malts
are

pale

refreshing

is
full
and

finish
is

this
isnt
a
very
good
beer
go
find
yourself
a
different

a

thin
white

pretty
standard
pale

stuff
great
hoppy
aroma
with
a
sweet
but
roasted

underneath
very
wellbalanced
flavor
nothing
too
original
but
just
a
great
drinkable
flavor
and
texture
solid
malt
base
with
light
citrus
borderline
grapefruity
and
decent
herbal
hops
nice
clean
brew
hit
the
damn
spot
tonight
and
hey
it
was
a
present
from
good
friends
who
just
returned
from
their
honeymoon
in
hawaii
so
it
had
a
solid
dose
of
love
and
affection
to
boot
cant
go
wrong
thanks
to
my
friend
jason
f
for
the
sample
overall
it
looks
like
i
left
the
best
until
last
out
of
the
three
kona
beers
that
i
tried
tonight
the
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
definitely
the
pick
of
the
bunch
very
nice
and
one
which
i
would
love
to
try
on
draft
on
the
big
island
one
day
aloha
drinkability
not
without
food
every
once
in
a
while
you
just
have
to
grab
a
brew
with
a
lizard
on
the
label
a
hazy
golden
amber
liquid
greets
the
drinker
the
quick
thin
lace
gives
way
to
a
very
slight
earthy
aroma
an
initial
sharper
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
floral
spice
the
malt
presence
is
very
limited
at
first
but
grows
heavier
and
becomes
quite
apparent
in
the
finish
im
curious
if
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
but
id
pass
on
a
2nd
offering
in
the
bottle
although
there
seems
to
be
a
decent
beer
lurking
underneath
interesting
brew
strong
hops
aroma
as
well
as
floral
esters
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
quite
the
hops
kick
in
the
finish
smooth
and
creamy
feel
very
drinkable
i
could
see
it
as
a
session
beer
mostly
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
small
but
nicely
creamy
sticky
white
head
smells
citrusy
at
first
orange
and
grapefruit
giving
way
to
more
pungent
floral
aromas
leafy
herbs
and
raw
grain
flavor
is
pretty
much
standard
classic
apa
floralcitrus
cascade
hop
bitterness
light
resin
and
a
clean
malty
sweetness
underneath
medium
bodied
finishing
clean
and
dry
nothing
memorable
but
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
wrong
either
goodstraightforward
apa
a
rather
nice
looking
beer
the
big
soapy
near
white
head
makes
this
look
delectable
lace
is
spotty
the
beer
is
a
nice
shade
of
golden
amber
and
once
the
head
calms
down
a
quarter
inch
layer
hangs
on
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
nice
crisp
and
semi
juicy
hop
aroma
over
a
bed
of
grainy
malt
dank
tropical
fruit
mixed
with
zesty
citrus
and
some
grassy
floral
taste
is
dry
and
briskly
hopped
with
doughy
slightly
caramel
maltiness
the
hop
bitterness
is
evenly
dispersed
throughout
and
lingers
on
for
awhile
after
the
finish
good
well
balanced
beer
with
a
slightly
forward
hop
presence
very
likable
and
also
sessionable
good
stuff
a
decent
beer
with
some
well
balanced
flavors
not
something
that
makes
me
go
wow
but
i
would
drink
it
again
recommended
got
this
one
bc
i
had
a
schlafly
pale
ale
draft
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
is
solid
but
nothing
spectacular
good
piney
flavor
thats
not
overwhelming
and
no
bitter
aftertaste
worth
getting
but
probably
not
better
than
your
favorite
ipa
schlafly
dry
hopped
american
pale
ale
45
a
well
balanced
pale
but
it
has
a
super
drinkable
lack
of
flavor
o
a
solid
beer
would
have
again
at
this
point
in
my
beerdrinking
life
i
have
to
wonder
how
many
pale
ales
ive
tried
this
one
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
and
populated
by
some
random
floaties
the
nose
comprises
dry
grapefruit
peel
mild
biscuit
light
toffee
and
a
touch
of
pine
resin
the
taste
focuses
on
the
resin
though
some
grapefruit
rind
dried
caramel
and
mild
grass
contribute
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
but
not
one
that
can
stand
up
to
the
heavy
hitters
of
the
style
this
is
an
underrated
hoppy
pale
ale
very
solid
on
draft
o
this
one
doesnt
skimp
on
the
hops
and
the
varietals
chosen
are
of
the
earthy
variety
so
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
citrusy
pale
ales
that
are
so
popular
lately
so
i
actually
liked
this
beer
pretty
well
to
me
it
was
nicely
hopped
but
not
over
done
keep
in
mind
this
is
not
an
ipa
as
some
seem
to
think
its
an
american
pale
ale
a
style
a
bit
lighter
all
around
use
that
for
a
basis
of
comparison
and
it
will
score
a
little
higher
probably
wont
seek
it
out
specifically
but
would
buy
again
if
i
came
across
it
and
was
in
the
mood
nothing
super
special
but
it
does
have
a
nice
fresh
hop
taste
to
it
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
to
order
a
glass
of
and
a
good
solid
choice
if
you
just
want
some
hops
dry
apa
by
the
schlafly
of
st
louis
copper
gold
with
lots
of
suspended
floatiesmother
wise
clear
with
a
slim
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
hoppy
not
as
intense
as
expected
fresh
flavor
bitter
dryish
and
enjoyable
great
aroma
good
flavor
solid
beer
o
i
like
this
beer
it
as
a
pleasant
complexity
in
the
hop
bill
the
sweet
malt
profile
supports
the
bitterness
it
drinks
like
an
ipa
with
training
wheels
good
job
as
usual
from
schlafly
more
herbal
than
hoppy
i
would
not
buy
again
what
else
can
i
say
to
meet
the
250
character
requirement
as
i
am
an
engineer
and
not
an
english
major
while
i
like
hoppy
beers
this
beer
had
a
taste
that
i
would
call
herbal
and
bitter
and
not
in
a
good
way
o
a
surprisingly
tasty
pale
well
balanced
and
satisfying
very
sippable
one
of
the
best
american
style
pale
ales
i
have
had
perhaps
aging
this
actually
helps
it
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brew
o
a
tasty
apa
id
drink
another
one
feel
rather
light
bodied
near
medium
carbonation
smooth

light

with
a
touch
of

no

and
citrus

of
grapefruit
pine
caramel
touch
of

bit
of
metal
a
touch
of
bell
pepper
finishes
really
clean
with
very
little
linger
the
bell
pepper
taste
most
present
here
very
drinkable
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
very
nicely
balanced
crisp
and
refreshing
apa
recommend
an
okay
apa
which
is
a
hard
territory
to
be
with
such
fierce
competition
with
great
representatives
of
the
style
in
the
us
smells
mildly
of
hops
fruit
malt
some
pepper
the
beer
has
a
light
aroma
but
it
works
well
the
taste
is
of
citrus
and
hop
with
a
hint
of
green
pepper
the
malt
is
light
but
in
the
background
has
a
pine
taste
as
well
very
smooth
but
not
overpowering
in
flavor
finish
is
of
hop
and
mild
pepper
o
the
feel
was
great
but
everything
else
was
rather
lacking
luckily
its
great
drinkability
helps
somewhat
to
mask
its
lessthanamazing
flavor
profile
still
this
isnt
going
to
be
on
my
repeat
purchase
list
anytime
soon
golden

i
can
see
the
microscopic
bits
of
evidence
from
dry
hopping
churning
within
this
unfiltered
beer
a
third
of
an
inch
of
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
reveals
some
pale
malta
sweetness
of
hops
that
with
this
blend
almost
deliver
a
honey
like
sweetness
that
is
more
of
a
cereal
grain
aroma
you
do
get
pale
malt
blending
fairly
well
with
citrus
and
pine
like
hops
that
seem
to
illicit
that
sweetness
hinted
at
with
the
aroma
the
mouth
is
dryslightly
warmand
then
prickly
from
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
theres
a
fading
bitterness
from
the
hops
overall
decent
try
fresher
next
time

if
it

a
terruble
beer
by
any
stretch
but
definitely
underwhelming
an
okay
apa
and
maybe
one
that
i
will
go
back
and
get
again
o
not
really
outstanding
but
an
average
pale
pretty
easy
to
dink
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
thats
a
little
fizzy
a
medium
body
and
a
dry
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
shows
off
more
malt
than
hops
it
was
average
to
me
and
bordered
on
a
letdown
since
its
called
a
dry
hopped
apa
should
have
just
been
called
apa
tasted
side
by
side
with
dales
pale
ale
my
gold
standard
for
apa
not
quite
as
bright
or
piney
or
as
bitter
in
the
finish
a
little
sweety
and
much
more
malty
all
good
and
many
would
prefer
the
schlafly
as
i
said
its
one
of
my
goto
ales
and
one
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
nice
and
hoppy
beer
but
who
isnt
quite
ready
for
something
like
bitters
or
a
powerful
ipa
o
3
75
this
is
a
solid
apa
i
love
the
addition
of
the
dry
hop
i
wish
the
aroma
endured
through
the
glass
as
strong
as
up
front
but
what
can
you
do
pours
a
beautiful
copper
amber
hue
with
a
bright
slightly
off
white
head
forming
thick
fine
speckled
lacing
is
left
down
the
sides
of
my
tulip
chalice
aroma
has
earthy
citric
and
resinous
based
hops
very
aromatic
very
nice
subtle
malt
biscuit
sweetness
going
on
not
too
complex
but
a
nice
lighter
hoppy
ale
flavor
ample
hop
bitterness
a
bit
of
hop
pellet
concentrated
hop
action
with
some
hop
flavors
layered
in
i
would
go
with
mild
dank
cannabis
and
citric
earthy
hops
actually
quite
nice
enough
sweetness
to
keep
things
rolling
but
really
the
hops
shine
here
a
bit
of
biscuit
malt
just
enough
to
make
the
beer
balanced
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
hop
oils
from
the
dry
hopping
process
medium
bodied
crisp
carbonation
feels
good
going
down
overall
the
type
of
beer
that
every
brewery
should
offer
flavorful
not
overkill
with
alcohol
or
hops
really
nice
warm
weather
hoppy
brew
overall
not
bad
has
decent
amount
of
hop
flavor
for
being
a
low
alcohol
beer
this
is
a
nice
lighter
beer
to
enjoy
especially
summertime
weather
worth
a
drink
but
nothing
to
actively
to
seek
out
i
went
through
a
phase
where
i
would
not
drink
a
beer
below
7
abv
because
i
didnt
think
that
they
could
have
enough
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
proved
me
wrong
and
i
love
it
for
it
o
this
is
a
solid
take
on
what
has
become
a
hohum
ubiquitous
style
it
doesnt
shine
but
neither
does
it
disappoint
o
3
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
ever
came
across
it
quite
a
drinkable
dry
hopped
pale
ale
the
beer
pours
a
coppery
amber
with
12
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
the
nose
is
mild
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
predominantly
floral
hops
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
floralcitrusy
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
mild
typical
pale
ale
sweetness
upfront
light
bodied
effervescet
and
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
the
bitterness
lingers
but
is
quite
mild
id
try
this
again
sessionable
and
tasty
standard
apa
nothing
exciting
a
bit
disappointing
considering
the
dry
hopping
but
no
off
flavors
nothing
very
exciting
but
still
a
good
hoppy
pale
ale
thanks
to
kirk
for
this
one
trying
to
remember
the
various
great
beers
i
had
while
bicycling
crosscountry
last
year
this
one
seems
not
too
well
known
outside
its
local
area
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
hadnt
been
in
the
states
for
some
years
and
was
quite
impressed
with
the
improvements
and
availability
of
good
craft
beers
you
are
excused
utah
and
i
recall
going
into
a
bottle
shop
somewhere
in
middle
america
land
of
bud
light
and
asking
for
something
dry
hopped
the
knowledgeable
guy
in
the
shop
sold
me
this
full
flavored
well
hopped
it
is
a
fine
one
overall
im
a
little
torn
by
this
one
it
is
fairly
easy
drinking
but
the
astringent
bitterness
can
be
a
little
much
after
awhile
probably
not
something
i
will
pick
up
very
often
poured
into
a
shaker
with
almost
no
head
though
it
appeared
to
be
poured
correctly
pale
orange
like
an
underripe
pumpkin
with
a
little
bit
of
haze
to
it
very
minimal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
was
very
clean
and
seemed
like
a
lot
of
crystal
malt
and
very
mild
bitter
nose
definitely
not
the
usual
west
coast
hope
smell
but
more
of
a
mild
slightly
resinous
nose
the
taste
was
very
much
like
the
nose
with
a
good
balanced
malt
backbone
slightly
bready
with
a
stinging
bitterness
and
a
spring
of
citrus
at
the
end
good
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
very
solid
offering
in
a
pale
ale
poured
this
apa
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
copper
color
produced
a
thick
creamy
white
head
very
nice
retention
and
leaves
an
above
average
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
and
citric
hops
medium
in
body
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
there
is
a
foundation
of
sweet
malted
grain
piney
hops
and
a
touch
of
fruity
apple
overall
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
great
session
beer
and
an
excellent
entry
level
apa
another
very
solid
offering
from
schlafly
good
but
a
little
pricey
o
good
apa
maybe
it
would
have
a
nicer
aroma
on
tap
or
from
a
fresher
bottle
but
thats
the
only
lacking
characteristic
of
this
apa
a
very
grainy
otherwise
dull
pale
ale
i
can
drink
this
but
its
not
what
it
says
it
is
and
its
disappointing
i
dont
plan
on
drinking
this
again
thats
for
sure
this
surprises
me
as
the
other
schlafly
beer
ive
had
was
stellar
and
very
hopforward
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
dryhopped
pale
ale
but
the
bitterness
seems
a
bit
high
and
the
dryhopping
comes
across
a
little
resiny
which
could
be
from
prolonged
exposure
to
the
beer
while
i
like
this
i
dont
love
it
and
would
probably
not
revisit
it
again
in
a
6pack
format
overall
this
is
a
really
delicious
hoppy
brew
that
i
was
glad
to
try
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
complexity
of
the
scent
so
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
but
still
good
enough
to
drink
regularly
nice
beer
will
have
my
bro
bootleg
it
up
to
me
again
when
he
gets
the
chance
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
oat
the
end
of
the
day
too
much
malt
even
for
an
apa
the
hops
needed
to
be
there
a
little
more
odd
as
heck
but
not
at
all
bad
this
would
cut
right
through
a
spicy
dish
given
the
fact
that
this
stuff
is
ubiquitous
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
90
miles
from
st
louis
this
could
be
a
goto
beer
for
thai
or
indian
nights
a
solid
apa
with
tremendous
balance
a
nice
easy
drinker
overall
even
though
malty
this
one
is
well
balanced
with
nice
hop
variability
a
memorable
beer
a
more
than
good
session
american
pale
ale
pours
a
light
and
bright
golden
color
with
a
tiny
bit
of
yeast
remaining
and
a
two
inch
head
white
and
dense
lasting
and
sticky
sexy
the
smell
is
pretty
bitter
with
english
hops
on
the
lighter
side
and
a
citrus
hop
profile
tangerines
and
lemon
zest
the
flavor
is
more
mild
almost
dull
or
mellow
not
as
jivey
as
the
nose
but
lots
of
hop
bitter
on
both
ends
and
enough
malt
in
the
middle
dry
hops
add
flavor
but
i
think
this
isnt
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
american
pale
ales
feel
is
solid
perfect
medium
body
and
great
carbonation
infinitely
sessionable
and
really
satisfying
as
a
morning
beer
malty
and
hoppy
at
the
same
time
without
being
overwhelming
a
worthy
quaff
for
sure
but
not
the
best
choice
at
the
taproom
overall
a
decent
brew
could
have
been
a
lot
better
flavor
has
a
good
malt
base
with
lots
of
hoppy
flavor
fruity
and
citrus
hops
lemon
and
grapefruit
maybe
a
bit
of
pine
resin
as
well
good
flavor
but
i
wanted
more
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
appropriate
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
only
had
one
of
these
but
it
would
have
been
easy
to
drink
a
few
in
a
session
even
with
the
alcohol
being
a
bit
higher
than
i
anticipated
this
is
atypical
for
a
pale
ale
but
only
because
ive
become
so
accustomed
to
the
norm
that
exemplifies
this
style
while
this
didnt
stand
out
a
ton
i
have
to
give
props
to
schlafly
for
pushing
the
edge
on
this
and
proving
me
wrong
when
it
comes
to
picturing
what
an
apa
should
look
and
taste
like
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
a
little
work
to
provide
a
little
more
body
and
lighter
carbonation
to
give
a
creamier
feel
would
be
welcome
nice
flavors
with
an
aggressive
bite
for
an
apa
my
first
from
shlafly
and
it
wont
be
my
last
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
a
detectable
but
soft
carbonated
feel
resulting
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
with
a
solidly
dry
finish
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
thickerbodied
but
this
is
still
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
refreshing
satisfying
warm
months
beer
drinkability
solid
and
very
drinkable
a
very
good
brew
overall
this
was
a
decent
example
of
an
apa
i
really
liked
the
way
the
hop
bitterness
popped
but
did
not
rip
the
top
layer
off
of
my
tongue
m
drying
pleasantly
grainy
really
sticks
in
the
tongue
appropriate
to
high
carbonation
do
this
beer
is
easy
to
write
off
upon
first
exposure
but
its
nuances
have
the
ability
to
win
over
the
senses
to
a
certain
extent
part
of
the
blame
lies
in
the
underwhelming
smell
which
while
not
offending
does
nothing
to
entice
the
palate
other
qualities
provide
more
interest
without
really
standing
out
among
other
examples
of
the
style
good
example
of
an
apa
if
you
can
keep
from
comparing
the
flavor
profiles
from
ipas
you
can
really
learn
to
enjoy
the
subtle
nuances
of
apas
a
good
choice
for
quaffing
with
friends
or
watching
the
game
balanced
and
unoffensive
if
less
than
memorable
i
had
been
skeptical
of
schlafy
products
but
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
i
could
enjoy
many
of
these
overall
just
great
loving
this
it
goes
down
like
nothing
and
is
so
easy
to
drink
beer
was
gone
in
less
than
2
minutes
it
was
so
good
glad
i
got
more
o
nice
well
balanced
apa
the
hops
dot
knock
you
over
or
anything
but
they
do
provide
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
needs
to
be
dryer
for
me
with
a
bit
more
umpth
not
bad
just
a
little
week
worth
a
try
however
although
the
hop
flavors
and
aromas
are
not
necessarily
my
favorites
this
is
a
great
balanced
and
easy
drinking
apa
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
st
louis
o
there
is
certainly
plenty
of
bitterness
to
be
had
with
this
pale
ale
which
is
something
i
do
enjoy
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
place
it
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
for
me
overall
its
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
o
not
at
all
bad
but
not
great
by
any
means
to
be
fair
ive
had
this
on
tap
at
schlafly
and
it
was
pretty
damn
good
the
bottled
version
just
seems
to
lose
something
though
even
though
it
isnt
that
old
at
all
o
a
good
apa
with
a
good
abv
worth
looking
for
not
bad
but
not
something
i
go
to
unless
the
options
are
limited
session
brew
for
sure
nothing
that
will
wow
but
a
good
take
on
the
style
trying
the
schlafly
apa
on
a
raining
monday
after
work
just
read
the
forum
regarding
a
post
i
put
about
zombie
dust
from
three
floyds
apparently
several
people
felt
the
schlafly
apa
rivals
the
dust
i
say
ney
ney
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
good
copper
color
clear
with
great
carbonation
and
finger
thick
white
head
that
is
lacing
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
can
smell
the
bitterness
with
touches
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
a
decent
hop
taste
mostly
of
bitter
citrus
grapefruit
hardly
any
pine
or
floral
notes
that
i
could
pick
up
the
beer
lingers
on
the
pallet
but
overall
a
decent
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
overly
bitter
worth
a
try
but
i
do
not
like
it
more
than
zdust
overall
kinda
meg
a
bit
bland
for
an
apa
imo
this
is
more
like
a
bitter
ale
than
anything
not
much
for
hop
flavoraroma
pine
hops
up
front
that
give
way
to
a
long
and
citrusy
finish
pretty
bitter
in
a
citrus
hop
sort
of
way
but
some
off
flavors
from
a
heavier
malt
bill
than
i
expected
this
gets
in
the
way
of
a
pretty
fantastic
lemon
taste
in
the
back
as
well
as
a
lemon
bitterness
that
would
make
this
really
well
balanced
and
lighter
in
body
there
is
a
certain
biscuit
quality
to
this
that
takes
away
from
potentially
delicious
citrus
hops
that
said
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
one
that
would
satisfy
most
hop
heads
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
and
doesnt
add
much
to
the
overall
end
product
solid
and
passable
apa
and
the
dryhopping
is
definitely
present
but
some
room
for
improvement
is
there
pours
a
hazy
orange
to
light
copper
body
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
with
very
good
retention
and
lacing
i
love
the
aromas
a
citrus
hoppiness
is
more
assertive
than
on
most
pale
ales
the
smell
of
caramel
maltiness
seems
pretty
normal
the
taste
is
hoppy
on
the
front
and
back
palates
with
malts
more
apparent
on
the
middle
overall
the
hop
to
malt
ratio
is
not
as
balanced
as
some
of
the
better
pale
ales
but
i
dont
think
balance
was
the
intended
objective
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
pub
food
of
all
sorts
i
quite
like
it
overall
decent
apa
from
the
cask
didnt
expect
much
carbonation
and
this
didnt
have
much
at
all
nice
hop
and
malt
character
would
like
to
try
it
on
the
tap
instead
of
the
cask
was
room
temperature
overall
i
was
quite
excited
to
try
schlafly
as
they
just
started
distributing
in
my
area
but
this
was
a
real
let
down
this
is
pretty
much
an
adjunct
with
more
hop
bitterness
i
will
not
give
up
on
schlafly
but
our
first
meeting
was
certainly
awkward
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
dont
know
about
this
one
this
one
brought
me
back
to
the
days
of
late
90s
college
when
beer
was
hardly
beer
im
going
to
skip
straight
to
smell
and
taste
on
this
one
i
thought
for
sure
i
was
diving
into
a
schlitz
or
schaeffer
the
nose
just
had
a
high
level
of
maltiness
too
it
the
hops
were
very
faint
although
this
isnt
an
ipa
so
its
not
exactly
designed
to
be
a
hopcentric
offering
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
quite
bitter
overall
i
enjoyed
having
a
chance
to
try
this
but
its
just
not
my
thing
probably
wont
be
coming
back
for
it
o
a
decent
apa
but
one
that
departs
from
ipa
origin
and
really
leans
to
the
side
of
just
a
pale
ale
while
i
like
the
hop
character
of
this
beer
its
not
astounding
i
could
use
both
more
bitterness
and
more
aroma
still
its
finely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
good
session
apa
and
a
nicely
done
beer
from
a
brewery
thats
normally
a
miss
or
disappointment
for
me
o
a
very
american
beer
hop
aroma
is
spot
on
but
is
a
little
lacking
on
the
flavor
of
the
overall
beer
oim
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
its
from
a
brewery
i
have
never
heard
of
but
it
makes
me
want
to
seek
more
of
them
out
very
balanced
no
flavor
overwhelms
another
part
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
the
body
is
medium
to
light
with
nice
fluffy
carbonation
the
slick
feel
leads
into
an
oily
finish
not
a
bad
effort
here
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head
and
great
retention
great
lacing
throughout
the
drink
aroma
of
piney
and
citric
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
with
great
balance
of
malts
this
tastes
fresh
and
clean
it
tastes
like
an
awesome
homebrew
and
i
mean
that
as
a
complement
its
smooth
and
refreshing
i
really
like
this
brew
o
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
hoppy
pale
ale
this
beer
keeps
things
interesting
with
the
dry
hopping
two
weeks
ago
when
i
had
this
a
little
fresher
the
citrus
and
pine
didnt
work
together
so
well
they
seemed
to
but
heads
in
the
flavor
profile
maybe
this
one
is
an
oddball
that
gets
a
little
sweet
spot
a
couple
months
out
a
good
buy
from
schlafly
o
at
the
price
there
are
better
session
beers
to
be
found
in
the
region
but
this
stands
up
well
enough
ill
work
through
the
rest
of
the
sixpack
happily
enough
and
am
happy
for
some
more
variety
from
my
corner
grocer
happy
20th
anniversary
taste
is
really
a
nice
drinkable
hoppy
flavor
blends
of
pine
and
citrus
not
in
your
face
though
mouth
feel
goes
along
with
the
nice
head
really
creamy
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
to
drink
and
i
will
buy
it
again
o
great
apa
style
not
extraordinary
but
worth
trying
if
you
like
apas
or
if
you
like
ipas
seek
this
out
o
enjoyed
this
one
on
tap
would
have
had
another
if
i
was
going
to
stay
longer
not
necissarily
complex
but
well
balanced
and
i
got
my
hops
fix
in
at
happy
hour
do
easy
drinking
but
was
really
hoping
for
more
from
this
offering
after
having
a
few
of
schlaflys
beers
at
their
taproom
last
week
in
st
louis
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
nothing
offputting
but
nothing
that
stands
out
shoot
for
something
else
from
this
solid
brewery
o
schlaflys
dryhopped
apa
is
a
rare
miss
from
a
very
solid
brewery
i
wont
hold
this
one
against
them
but
ill
be
damned
if
this
isnt
one
of
the
most
dissapointing
dryhopped
brews
ive
ever
quaffed
youre
best
bet
is
avoding
this
one
entirely
overall
this
was
a
good
pale
ale
crisp
enough
with
a
solid
hop
profile
not
a
ton
going
on
but
tastes
quite
nice
o
solid
apa
nice
balance
to
the
malt
and
hop
bill
moderate
abv
makes
it
very
sessionable
o
my
basic
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
as
soon
as
my
glass
is
empty
ill
have
forgotten
what
it
tastes
like
its
just
nothing
special
and
not
even
a
good
simple
beer
it
just
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
in
my
opinion
the
best
that
they
have
that
is
somewhat
readily
available
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
rather
sessionable
this
pours
golden
brown
with
nice
chunky
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
pungent
even
as
you
pour
this
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
grassyhops
smells
but
there
is
a
fresh
bready
element
too
the
taste
is
much
more
herbal
and
hoppy
than
the
schafly
pale
ale
but
the
bready
malts
flavors
come
out
even
more
in
this
beer
i
even
get
a
little
green
pepper
vibe
that
i
will
attribute
to
the
crisp
clean
bite
there
is
great
complexity
in
the
balance
here
and
i
am
thrilled
that
im
not
suffering
through
a
sweet
heavy
bodied
syrupy
beer
this
is
a
solidly
crafted
beer
where
the
flavors
sits
on
the
tongue
and
invokes
the
next
sip
without
leaving
a
mucky
gross
taste
that
you
find
yourself
wanting
to
wash
down
this
is
medium
bodied
but
definitely
something
i
could
have
a
few
of
pours
golden
orange
with
thin
fizzy
white
head
good
head
retention
and
lacing
nice
carbonation
bright
malty
aroma
fresh
grain
with
a
pleasant
resinous
hoppiness
and
some
spicy
yeast
notes
a
heavy
malt
flavor
not
overly
sweet
though
however
there
is
a
strong
bitterness
without
much
to
balance
it
resinous
and
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
also
out
of
whack
from
the
perceived
bitterness
of
the
beer
im
usually
a
fan
of
resinous
pine
tree
hops
but
this
one
is
a
bit
overboard
on
the
bitterness
without
much
hop
flavor
to
show
for
it
o
not
to
shabby
its
not
sierra
nevada
in
terms
of
an
american
pale
ale
but
for
the
value
its
something
i
will
absolutely
purchase
again
this
is
a
great
session
ale
and
a
go
to
when
i
need
a
quick
hop
fix
with
mild
alcohol
content
o
ive
heard
nice
things
about
this
one
but
you
know
what
they
say
tasting
is
believing
overall
i
am
very
lucky
to
have
had
this
ale
during
the
end
of
prohibition
festival
they
will
not
be
brewing
a
batch
like
this
again
they
said
very
complexed
and
the
citra
hops
added
a
great
component
to
the
ale
will
be
waiting
to
have
the
apa
once
again
in
bottle
and
see
the
differences
between
these
two
very
nice
could
drink
more
than
2
but
the
availability
was
limited
thankful
for
the
opportunity
but
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
apa
that
i
had
higher
hoped
for
o
not
the
best
apa
i
have
had
one
or
two
worse
but
the
malt
backbone
was
off
and
not
supported
by
enough
hop
flavor
i
would
like
to
visit
this
one
again
down
the
road
since
it
seems
others
dont
get
that
alcohol
burn
but
for
now
i
would
say
it
is
a
little
below
middle
of
the
road
per
style
overall
this
is
pretty
good
apa
far
from
the
best
i
have
had
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
schlafly
worth
drinking
d
a
nice
pale
ale
from
schlafly
a
fairly
complex
balance
of
hop
flavors
contributes
to
an
extra
dimension
that
many
apas
lack
this
is
more
grainy
than
malty
but
it
works
well
enough
certainly
worth
a
look
flavor
is
rich
chewy
and
full
of
strong
pine
and
orange
citrus
notes
very
flavorful
and
quite
enjoyable
on
a
par
with
good
ipas
this
one
is
one
of
schlaflys
finest
and
my
favorite
of
their
regular
line
nice
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
some
time
smells
of
roasted
grain
citrus
and
sweet
bread
tangy
grapefruit
dominates
the
initial
taste
but
gives
way
to
creamy
breadiness
and
sweet
honey
a
substantial
body
and
crisp
fresh
flavors
make
this
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
solid
drinker
and
was
a
great
compliment
to
some
fried
fish
light
amber
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
in
a
few
moments
there
is
a
faint
yeasty
aroma
that
couples
with
hints
of
the
wellbalanced
and
wellintegrated
hop
flavors
a
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
beer
the
malts
and
grain
flavors
nicely
balance
the
moderate
hop
profile
which
tend
toward
grapefruit
citrus
flavors
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
seems
to
straddle
the
boundaries
of
a
hoppy
ipa
and
a
smooth
drinking
pale
ale
no
complaints
on
drinkability
the
5
9
abv
really
slowed
me
down
though
probably
because
i
had
a
lighter
supper
than
usual
drinkability
this
brew
is
without
a
doubt
a
sleeper
in
my
opinion
solid
all
around
its
sessionable
easy
to
drink
pleasant
on
the
eyes
and
taste
buds
and
is
just
really
pretty
darn
good
its
not
outstanding
but
better
than
most
a
pleasant
suprise
that
i
will
visit
again
sometime
in
the
spring
or
summer
d
this
has
easy
drinkability
but
mostly
because
it
has
a
muted
overall
flavor
abv
was
low
enoguh
that
drinking
many
pints
would
be
in
the
future
a
easy
drinking
pale
ale
but
i
couldnt
really
get
any
dry
hopping
flavors
like
i
thought
i
would
be
able
superb
offering
for
a
hoppy
apa
very
drinkable
solid
beer
might
make
a
good
gateway
to
hoppier
beers
for
folks
who
dont
normally
like
the
style
will
pick
this
up
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
i
would
consider
giving
this
beer
another
shot
when
i
am
more
aware
of
the
freshness
d
not
quite
what
i
was
expected
from
the
aroma
and
not
something
i
would
order
again
d
the
sweet
finish
and
slightly
sticky
texture
hold
down
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
apa
and
a
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
in
michigan
overall
a
pretty
mediocre
pale
ale
for
being
a
dryhopped
one
its
certainly
not
bad
very
drinkable
but
this
could
pass
for
a
blond
in
the
nw
drinkability
to
be
honest
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
the
hopping
was
a
bit
off
and
the
weird
tortilla
taste
was
distracting
this
falls
short
of
expectations
especially
considering
how
many
great
apas
come
from
the
midwest
given
this
beer
was
bottled
eleven
days
ago
i
will
assume
that
this
hasnt
passed
its
freshness
threshold
drinkability
overall
pretty
enjoyable
just
wish
that
the
hops
would
have
been
a
little
more
in
your
face
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
d
this
is
a
pretty
average
apa
the
cask
version
of
this
beer
is
astoundingly
hoppy
and
should
be
experienced
d
all
in
all
a
good
not
quite
great
representation
of
style
i
though
it
was
a
good
beer
but
the
advertised
dryhopping
didnt
manifest
itself
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
drinkability
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
taxing
on
the
palate
o
b
pretty
good
for
a
pale
ale
which
isnt
my
favorite
style
definitely
like
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
light
enough
to
be
enticing
would
consider
buying
in
the
future
pours
a
moderate
orange
color
with
a
white
head
nose
brings
some
orange
grapefruit
and
hints
of
pine
there
is
some
moderate
malt
in
the
background
that
works
its
way
into
the
taste
the
taste
is
mainly
comprised
of
citrus
hops
the
dry
hopping
has
done
this
quite
well
nice
mouthfeel
with
good
bitterness
levels
and
a
really
high
drinkability
factor
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
love
to
have
some
more
but
i
cant
get
it
here
in
california
d
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
likable
and
drinkable
m
d
very
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
light
body
and
overall
good
flavors
but
still
an
average
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
thats
interesting
and
unique
but
it
seems
to
lack
drinkability
and
a
level
of
carbonation
that
could
make
a
beer
like
this
much
more
refreshing
and
highlight
some
of
the
hop
characters
a
bit
more
drinks
great
i
wish
i
could
find
this
one
regularly
because
its
a
good
value
and
good
beer
allaround
dexceptional
drinkability
great
lawnmower
beer
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
and
gives
sn
pale
a
run
for
its
money
classic
and
true
theres
not
much
that
separates
schlaflys
pale
ale
from
many
others
who
are
doing
this
style
very
well
but
this
one
seems
less
processed
and
has
a
bright
and
vibrant
freshness
to
it
similar
to
a
few
great
homebrewed
versions
mouth
feel
wise
its
got
a
crispness
of
a
lighter
beer
but
a
slight
warming
feeling
in
the
end
overall
a
good
complex
stronger
session

it

drinkable
brew
and
one
i
wouldnt
avoid
in
the
future
decent
apa
that
is
worth
trying
and
something
i
could
see
myself
ordering
again
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
its
not
a
doover
d
a
moderate
abv

that
far
outpaces
most
apas
im
diggin
both
a
nice

sip
through
after
a
long
week

it

this
is
really
an
allday
kind
of
beer
light
body
bitter
and
refreshing
and
a
very
moderate
abv
would
allow
this
one
to
be
sipped
on
morning
er
late
afternoon
on
into
the
night
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
adds
a
hint
of
citrus
towards
the
finish
which
presents
with
a
nicely
balanced
touch
of
bitterness
this
has
great
carbonation
and
a
nice
medium

excellent
feel
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
problem
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
resny
palate
with
some
earthy
hops
and
a
little
citric
bitterness
the
malts
add
some
toast
with

be
more

to
me
this
is
very
drinkable
apa
probably
not
the
best
one
out
there
but
definately
worth
having
very
balanced
and
smooth
but
with
enough
hop
kick
to
satisfy
quite
drinkable
and
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
which
cant
seem
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
be
an
ipa
or
not

crisp

refreshing
id
buy
it
again
beer
is
smooth
with
only
moderate
bitterness
it
finishes
nicely
but
dry
the
more
i
drink
the
more
harsh
the
finish
becomes
i
think
the
bitterness
is
growing
on
me
i
think
the
best
part
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
i
feel
that
there
are
better
hops
to
use
for
dry
hopping
overall
the
beer
was
ok
to
good
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
again
on
draft
somewhere
i
think
the
tap
would
really
open
this
beer
up
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
slowly
fades
not
much
aroma
just
a
trace

the
taste
is

is
not
a
bad
thing
it
has
a
medium

continued
carbonation

mildly
dry

would
like
to
try
this

very
pleasing
and
one

for
prolonged

good
taste
is
also
pretty
hoppy
with
similar
citrus
tastes
as
well
as
some
floral
earthy
tastes
i
much
prefer
the
added
hops
from
the
cask
than
this
out
of
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
drinkability
is
solid
for
this
abv
is
medium
grade
and
taste
is
good
for
the
style
picked
up
a
single
12
oz
bottle
dated
10509
last
week
at
the
recommendation
of
a
fellow
beer
lover
poured
out
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
decent
head
and
tiny
bubbles
rising
quickly
the
color
was
the
way
i
like
to
see
these
types
look
smelled
of
pineapple
citrus
with
a
nice
crisp
hops
tone
in
the
background
mild
flavor
with
citrus
fruitshops
and
malt
nicely
balanced
leading
up
to
a
fairly
dry
finish
pleasant
aftertaste
brought
on
from
the
dry
hopping
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
good
bitter
bite
on
the
way
down
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
low
abv
that
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
taste
of
schlaflys
dry
hopped
and
surly
not
my
last
i
could
easily
drink
6
or
more
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
a
try
but
also
worth
improving
upon
too
overall
wellrounded
easy
drinkin
apa
its
simple
and
to
the
point
i
love
how
the
hops
come
together
with
the
breadlike
malt
and
in
good
balance
also
my
favorite
offering
from
schlafly
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
thins
out
a
tad
bit
as
i
drink
and
it
could
use
just
a
little
bit
more
body
drinkability
is
pretty
good
however
and
it
would
serve
well
as
a
session
beer
d
another
good
example
of
an
apa
a
mild
bitterness
and
an
overall
refreshing
quality
make
this
a
nice
sessionable
pale
ale
this
beer
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
with
a
great
foamy
head
and
perfect
lacing
wonderful
leafy
hop
aroma
greets
your
nose
and
flirts
with
your
senses
as
your
mouth
begins
to
water
in
anticipation
and
no
doubt
about
it
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
nice
sweet
citrusy
balance
this
is
an
excellent
ale
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
schlafly
perhaps
a
bit
too
bitter
for
some
but
to
me
its
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
to
slightly
coarse
with
perfect
carbonation
ease
of
consumption
oh
yeah
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
with
the
nice
hop
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
great
beer
for
the
price
as
well
d
im
really
trying
to
give
this
beer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
because
i
know
its
a
bit
past
its
prime
however
its
hard
the
flavor
is
not
there
there
is
no
crispness
no
fresh
hop
flavor
the
profile
is
messy
and
the
carbonated
mouth
just
makes
all
the
lack
of
qualities
stand
out
even
more
i
dont
think
im
gonna
have
this
one
again
nice
color
exceptionally
light
in
color
with
a
decent
head
dont
love
the
smell
its
a
little
to
earthy
for
me
the
beer
is
good
to
excellent
in
taste
has
an
overall
feel
that
seems
to
coat
your
whole
mouth
with
a
nice
citrus
flavor
that
isnt
too
bitter
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
has
a
great
balance
with
the
hops
overall
this
beer
is
really
good
the
smell
is
the
only
thing
that
puts
me
off
a
bit
but
the
flavor
is
the
most
important
part
so
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
as
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
anyone
who
likes
a
pale
ale
im
guessing
the
smell
must
be
related
to
the
dry
hopping
but
i
havent
had
enough
dry
hopped
beer
to
be
sure
drinkability
this
is
one
easy
drinker
plenty
of
flavour
and
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
bring
the
a
game
for
this
delicious
american
pale
ale
this
would
be
a
cool
beer
to
buy
often
if
it
was
available
here
my
hats
off
to
the
brewers
this
one
looks
very
nice
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
with
a
little
layer
of
yeast
falling
down
towards
the
end
the
head
is
at
least
an
inch
dense
and
white
which
ends
up
leaving
very
nice
lacing
a
good
looking
pale
ale
the
smell
is
nice
its
very
clean
filled
with
a
light
sugary
caramelly
sweetness
with
some
crusty
bread
the
hops
are
nice
a
bit
zesty
and
leafy
but
not
incredibly
robust
seems
nice
and
a
bit
better
than
normal
the
taste
is
nice
too
clean
and
refreshing
a
slightly
bready
sweet
and
nutty
malt
comes
up
with
a
layer
of
slightly
herbal
hops
the
bitterness
is
low
the
hops
have
a
bit
of
pollen
a
hint
of
sweet
lime
kind
of
leafy
its
really
nice
but
not
one
that
will
really
wow
you
the
body
is
about
medium
the
carbonation
provides
a
nice
rush
but
doesnt
really
sting
i
think
its
good
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
think
its
almost
as
good
as
it
gets
as
far
as
a
drinkable
beer
this
could
make
a
very
pleasant
night
of
drinking
it
doesnt
overdo
it
on
bitterness
or
resins
a
nice
smooth
slightly
sweet
malt
body
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
d
really
drinkable
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
very
crisp
and
hopmalt
balance
is
tremendous
very
easy
drinker
i
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
rather
easily
this
brew
gets
a
lot
of
shelf
space
in
st
louis
supermarkets
and
i
can
see
why
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
schlafly
i
would
buy
that
again
seems
like
potentially
a
lovely
brew
will
hopefully
come
across
a
better
sample
in
the
future
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
frothy
cloudlike
head
the
nose
is
of
hops
more
subdued
than
some
of
the
earlier
ones
i
had
i
should
have
reviewed
this
a
long
time
ago
i
just
found
this
one
in
the
back
of
my
beer
cabinet
bottled
22409
still
west
coast
type
hops
citrusy
and
piney
the
hops
are
still
apparent
in
the
flavor
grapefruit
comes
to
mind
immediately
slightly
resinous
and
piney
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
balance
but
this
is
definitely
a
hop
forward
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
velvety
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
apa
again
i
should
have
rated
this
as
a
fresher
beer
but
it
still
stands
up
over
time
definitely
the
best
schlafly
beer
ive
had
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
but
not
my
favorite
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
two
finger
of
offwhite
head
head
retains
well
and
recedes
to
a
layer
that
stays
fairly
frothy
and
thick
leaving
nice
solid
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
floral
hops
some
citrus
hops
and
faint
pale
malts
taste
starts
with
citrus
hop
bitternes
balanced
in
the
middle
with
pale
malts
and
a
touch
of
sweeter
caramel
malts
finishes
with
a
floral
hop
bitterness
medium
body
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
crisp
dry
finish
to
this
beer
another
solid
offering
from
schlafly
i
could
sit
with
this
one
all
day
drinkability
eh
this
stuff
is
decent
but
nothing
special
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
procure
much
more
of
this
stuff
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
carbonated
a
pretty
nice
apa
considering
i
havent
really
had
a
good
new
one
that
i
really
liked
in
months
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
unfortunately
and
i
found
it
to
have
too
much
of
the
hop
character
and
bitterness
that
has
come
to
be
slightly
revolting
over
the
last
year
or
so
i
think
if
it
was
a
bit
more
balanced
with
some
residual
malt
sweetness
this
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
definitely
would
drink
this
one
again
drinkability
a
very
solid
brew
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
dry
hopping
adds
a
nice
touch
to
this
one
and
at
5
9
you
can
have
a
couple
of
these
to
truly
appreciate
that
touch
its
not
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
but
its
near
the
top
of
the
ladder
a
very
drinkable
wellcrafted
brew
12oz
poured
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
fairly
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
held
decent
retention
and
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
were
weaker
than
expected
some
floral
hops
with
a
fruity
aspect
of
apples
or
grapes
tastes
were
much
sweeter
than
expected
especially
initially
very
fruity
with
an
apple
and
grape
juice
taste
some
faint
toasted
grains
a
slight
citrus
and
floral
hop
taste
comes
in
towards
the
finish
finishes
dry
but
fairly
sweet
about
half
way
through
the
hops
seem
to
come
through
more
offering
some
bitterness
and
hop
oils
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
but
still
seems
ok
to
me
towards
the
end
the
hops
continue
to
build
on
the
palate
and
the
dryness
keeps
you
coming
back
for
another
sip
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
profile
because
of
the
giant
hop
cone
on
the
label
but
in
the
end
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
with
tremendous
balance
i
liked
the
fruitiness
which
offered
a
refreshing
taste
with
excellent
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
apa
when
had
fresh
this
is
truly
an
incredible
example
of
a
classic
dry
hopped
american
pale
ale
dvery
drinkable
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
and
mild
enough
body
to
pound
quite
a
few
down
while
enjoying
a
good
bbq
on
the
back
porch
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
as
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
other
than
that
it
is
a
nice
session
beer
i
recently
discovered
the
schlafly
brewery
on
my
last
trip
to
st
louis
and
i
have
to
say
they
are
one
impressive
microbrew
i
personally
am
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
beers
and
this
one
definitely
hits
the
spot
aside
from
its
strong
hoppy
flavor
this
apa
manages
to
finish
smoothly
with
a
bitter
twist
excellent
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
leaning
toward
light
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
a
good
drinker
mild
enough
so
as
not
to
assault
my
palate
but
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
convince
me
to
have
another
drinkability
is
good
and
has
been
a
go
to
beer
for
me
for
some
time
now
overall
this
is
a
solid
apa
and
one
that
i
could
have
often
definitely
worth
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
bite
of
carbonation
d
i
like
the
way
the
malt
and
hops
are
balanced
in
this
almost
like
a
lager
the
citrus
flavor
from
dry
hopping
gives
it
crisp
and
clean
taste
this
is
very
drinkable
overall
while
not
mind
blowing
in
anyway
it
was
very
nicely
done
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
try
thing
this
one
again
pours
gold
in
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
head
this
is
the
hoppiest
is
that
even
a
word
that
schlafly
currently
offers
so
im
usually
drinking
this
smell
of
hops
citrus
grapefruit
smells
more
hoppy
then
it
really
is
could
use
more
taste
is
of
slight
hops
citrus
bitterness
but
im
wanting
more
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
its
lacking
i
usually
drink
this
when
im
at
the
taproom
andor
bottleworks
but
i
would
like
something
with
a
bit
more
umph
decent
apa
i
have
had
this
both
on
tap
and
in
bottle
i
surprisingly
enjoy
it
from
the
bottle
as
i
found
the
tap
to
have
lost
some
of
the
hop
edge
maybe
it
was
just
an
old
brew
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
and
has
become
my
standby
when
i
can
find
it
a
solid
choice
for
an
apa
you
get
a
big
hop
aroma
from
this
beer
but
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
smell
which
is
a
bit
like
cereal
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
bold
not
that
this
beer
is
completely
without
character
it
is
its
just
not
very
complex
you
can
get
this
beer
all
over
st
louis
where
it
is
a
favorite
i
retried
this
brew
with
a
1
month
bottled
on
date
the
taste
was
crisp
and
the
sour
flavors
were
not
apparent
maybey
i
had
a
light
damaged
bottle
the
last
time
but
this
brew
was
good
and
i
will
enjoy
this
brew
some
more
changed
the
rating
oh
yea
this
one
has
some
lupulin
bitterness
kind
of
an
herbal
citrus
hop
flavor
light
bodied
with
a
very
weak
malt
presence
but
sometimes
that
is
a
good
thing
carbonation
is
too
high
but
it
tastes
pretty
clean
and
fresh
a
nice
beer
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
poured
a
cloudy
amberorange
color
produced
a
huge
head
at
first
i
thought
i
just
poured
it
poorly
but
upon
pouring
a
couple
others
later
all
of
them
had
a
huge
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
fairly
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
in
both
aroma
and
taste
its
pretty
hoppy
and
has
a
sort
of
sweet
taste
to
it
but
also
kind
of
bitter
mouthfeel
is
fairly
average
nothing
special
there
at
first
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
beer
and
thought
i
couldnt
drink
that
many
at
once
but
after
a
second
i
found
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
no
problem
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
might
pick
it
up
again
if
it
were
on
tap
somewhere
and
the
other
choices
were
poor
i
would
have
no
problem
getting
one
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
not
that
dark
but
not
quite
clear
it
looks
good
the
smell
is
pine
and
citrus
on
the
first
sip
you
get
the
taste
to
match
the
smell
hops
hops
hops
tasted
like
pine
that
got
more
citrus
notes
as
it
lingered
hops
dominate
but
dont
wash
out
the
malt
flavor
quite
tasty
for
someone
like
me
who
isnt
really
a
hophead
its
about
as
hoppy
as
i
like
beer
very
drinkable
i
have
no
problem
putting
back
five
or
six
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
glass
shows
decent
lacing
as
i
put
it
back
down
on
the
bar
all
in
all
an
excellent
ale
for
those
who
like
a
lot
a
hops
but
not
crazy
ipa
levels
recommended
d
pretty
drinkable
quite
hoppy
but
it
should
be
and
you
should
be
expecting
it
not
sure
where
the
sulfurous
smell
came
from
but
was
very
detrimental
amber
in
color
with
an
orange
tinge
slightly
cloudy
fine
white
head
light
citrus
hop
aroma
delicate
fleeting
citrus
hops
up
front
mellows
into
a
soft
floral
midpalate
with
pale
malt
lending
some
light
grainy
notes
finishes
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
lingering
grain
flavor
a
solid
pale
ale
malt
bill
is
perfect
for
delivering
hops
fresh
bready
unobtrusive
and
i
suspect
this
is
really
good
when
fresh
on
tap
mouth
is
crisp
and
slightyl
dry
drinks
easy
and
damn
what
a
good
job
by
schlafly
this
is
one
ill
have
around
much
more
often
i
may
have
found
my
perfect
summer
yard
work
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
almost
golden
in
color
grainy
crisp
aroma
moderate
head
with
good
lacing
throughout
lots
of
hops
evident
very
good
going
down

throughout
excellent
apa
imo
will
definitely
buy
again
bought
it
at
the
only
place
in
our
town
i
could
find
will
make
sure
they
keep
carrying
it
to
me
a
good
value
for
1
25bottle
including
tax
cheers
dvery
tasty
beerperhaps
my
next
favorite
session
beer
i
should
have
picked
up
more
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
not
only
a
taste
sample
but
a
beer
you
could
enjoy
regularly
had
from
a
12oz
bottle
purchased
in
peoria
last
week
the
beer
is
hazy
light
orange
colored
some
very
fine
yeast
floaties
theres
a
little
dry
lace
on
the
glass
which
is
nice
the
beer
smells
hoppy
but
in
a
bitter
way
not
citrus
or
pine
which
would
be
preferable
for
my
palate
the
taste
is
toasted
malt
a
little
biscuity
with
a
hops
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
decent
carbonation
it
could
be
that
this
beer
is
a
little
past
its
prime
i
like
to
get
dryhopped
beers
fresh
but
still
this
is
pretty
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
caramel
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
decent
retention
taste
is
very
hoppy
up
front
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavors
light
dry
mouthfeel
fairly
drinkable
doesnt
stand
up
to
most
of
schlaflys
offerings
serving
type
bottle
its
okay
but
good
only
for
a
brief
blast
of
hops
and
little
else
nice
apa
showcasing
those
great
american
hops
thanks
to
htomsirveaux
for
including
this
one
in
a
recent
trade
d
very
drinkable
especially
on
handpull
at
the
taproom
overall
a
tasty
apa
but
i
dont
get
anything
from
it
that
really
stands
out
i
do
have
to
say
i
find
nothing
wrong
with
it
as
it
has
a
good
level
of
hop
bitterness
but
is
not
by
any
means
overwhelming
just
a
solid
example
of
what
i
think
an
apa
should
taste
not
bad
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
profiles
considering
that
this
was
dry
hopped
but
this
ended
up
being
a
solid
drinker
especially
when
you
factor
in
that
this
is
nearly
6
serving
type
bottle
di
just
said
session
beer
didnt
i
well
ill
stand
behind
that
i
could
drink
this
all
night
alcohol
level
is
a
bit
high
to
be
perfect
a
little
smoother
than
an
ipa
md
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
very
well
balanced
and
nicely
carbonated
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
apa
i
would
never
be
displeased
with
a
sixer
of
this
in
my
fridge
another
dependable
offering
from
schlalfly
drinkability
is
high
its
a
tasty
beer
well
made
for
the
most
part
and
an
easy
drinker
pours
a
very
clear
light
brown
body
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
is
very
lasting
dark
grapey
aroma
dusty
malty
fruity
taste
some
sweet
maltiness
a
little
nutty
dark
grape
taste
soft
mouthfeel
some
hoppiness
but
mostly
a
malty
taste
it
has
a
beautiful
bronze
color
with
a
tan
head
and
lace
there
is
a
ton
of
lace
and
head
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
great
fruity
and
floral
aroma
the
floral
aroma
is
very
clean
and
crisp
it
is
not
overly
bitter
but
the
hop
flavor
is
predominant
and
you
can
tell
that
it
has
been
dry
hopped
the
body
is
carbonated
just
right
for
a
medium
bodied
beer
the
aftertaste
is
the
bitterest
thing
about
the
flavor
dnot
very
assertive
for
this
style
but
all
styles
have
a
range
and
this
is
on
the
weak
end
of
the
assertive
flavor
scale
d
a
very
nice
apa
very
smooth
good
flavor
very
easy
to
reach
for
another
recommended
delicious
nice
slightly
cloudy
golden
brown
body
with
thin
head
but
good
retention
strong
aroma
with
lots
of
floral
hops
lots
of
hop
flavor
as
well
with
a
bit
of
mild
malts
hidden
in
the
middle
in
contrast
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
soft
and
even
fluffy
at
the
front
until
a
more
bitter
and
tingly
finish
very
interesting
great
beer
even
though
im
no
hophead
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
apa
with
a
nice
hop
quality
and
a
solid
malt
base
nicely
composed
drinkability
to
me
was
good
for
this
style
im
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
and
related
styles
but
this
one
had
enough
balance
in
it
to
where
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
if
offered
worth
giving
this
one
a
try
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
an
attractive
pillowy
white
head
the
head
recedes
but
never
leaves
and
a
slight
lacing
is
left
smell
is
a
nice
amount
of
piney
hops
and
slight
papery
oxidization
but
not
enough
to
be
a
bother
taste
follows
the
smell
with
piney
hops
to
start
but
then
developing
into
a
surprisingly
sweet
malt
flavor
finish
is
moderate
bitterness
but
a
little
too
short
mouth
is
medium
but
with
very
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
i
actually
prefer
this
to
dales
pale
which
says
quite
a
bit
d
a
tasty
brew
thats
easy
to
drink
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
going
to
like
this
at
first
but
this
is
a
damn
good
little
brew
actually
behind
alpha
king
this
is
the
tastiest
apa
that
ive
had
its
hoppy
piney
and
delicious
well
done
schlafly
drinkability
the
medicinal
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
this
is
a
pretty
decent
session
beer
otherwise
sampled
at
the
brewery
in
st
louis
while
on
a
road
trip
with
my
lady
the
beer
was
honey
gold
with
amber
highlights
and
a
creamy
white
head
great
retention
and
solid
lacing
aromas
of
piney
hops
and
mint
with
sweet
malts
and
spices
beneath
the
flavors
are
again
hopsforward
piney
and
citric
a
maltybready
character
appears
in
the
middle
to
add
some
gumption
and
balance
as
the
beer
warms
it
gets
more
drinkable
and
the
hops
provides
a
resinlike
tonguecoating
dry
finish
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
sessionable
and
enjoyable
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
seeking
out
d
great
taste
great
session
beer
for
hop
heads
pours
a
very
slightly
foggy
amber
with
a
decent
crème
head
nose
is
almost
like
a
musty
minor
citrus
thing
flavor
is
sweet
and
there
is
a
fairly
thick
amount
of
citrus
in
there
as
it
warms
it
gets
smoother
and
the
sweet
tone
really
becomes
nice
feel
has
a
slight
bite
to
the
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
just
a
slight
bit
sticky
but
overall
smooth
this
is
smooth
and
nice
to
drink
however
i
say
put
this
in
a
cask
and
treat
it
right
then
well
have
something
reeeally
nice
had
on
tap
at
a
recent
visit
to
the
flying
saucer
this
beer
was
served
in
a
nonbranded
shaker
pint
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
golden
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
left
sticky
lacing
down
the
entirety
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
piney
hops
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
subtle
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
spot
on
for
an
apa
a
nice
piney
hop
presence
thats
not
overpowering
yet
strong
enough
to
let
a
mild
bitterness
reside
on
the
tongue
the
sweet
malty
backbone
comes
out
in
the
finish
to
push
the
hops
off
the
palate
really
nice
an
crisp
mouthfeel
its
light
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
this
is
a
really
easily
drinkable
brew
by
schlafly
i
really
think
that
their
best
brews
are
their
sessionable
ones
thanks
to
jtrockchalk
for
the
chance
to
try
this
d
a
very
balanced
beer
that
could
be
a
session
beer
for
me
the
low
price
and
availability
also
make
this
more
drinkable
drinkable
but
nothing
great
does
not
leave
a
lasting
impression
d
a
great
and
wonderfully
drinkable
apa
taste
and
aroma
blew
me
away
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
can
get
their
hands
on
it
big
thanks
to
stlstoutaddict
for
this
one
pours

golden
yellow
with

fluffy

head
on
an
aggressive
pour
into
a
sam
perfect
pint
glass
wonderful
citrusy
smell
great
big

for
a
pale
ale
i
love
it
great
balanced
flavor
as
well
great
hop
bite
with
some
grapefruit
and
orange
tinges
then
mellows
quickly
but
smoothly
with
a
sweet
malt
finish
great
session
beer
wish
i
had
more
this
brewery
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
note
this
review
is
for
the
bottled
version
the
casked
version
available
at
the
downtown
brewpub
is
a
step
up
in
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
must
try
do
not
blow
this
one
off
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
pints
to
ever
cross
youre
lips
its
almost
like
a
cross
between
the
floyds
gumball
head
and
alpha
king
hazed
honey
blonde
with
a
whippedalmost
meringuelike
head
that
lingers
long
into
the
drink
leaving
impressive
sticky
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
mostly
fresh
piney
hops
and
faint
yeasty
bread
taste
is
very
balanced
between
malty
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
silky
smooth
textures
dominate
the
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
darn
close
to
a
perfect
everyday
aparight
up
there
with
sierra
nevada
delicious
highly
drinkable
apa
this
brew
is
a
must
try
in
my
book
very
enjoyable
glad
i
started
of
with
this
one
today
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
amber
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
to
nothing
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
smell
is
dominated
by
the
resiny
pine
hops
and
citrus
with
a
definite
bready
malt
aroma
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
the
same
pine
needle
hoppy
flavor
with
a
bit
of
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
malt
background
is
again
evident
and
balances
out
the
hops
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slightly
sticky
with
very
little
carbonation
leaving
the
resin
aftertaste
to
linger
this
is
a
very
drinkable
apa
as
the
dryhopping
is
not
overthetop
d
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
with
a
pizza
in

about
an

drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
quite
sessionable
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
apas
around
another
good
beer
from
schlafly
d
i
liked
the
way
it
finished
not
the
typical
bitter
aftertaste
that
you
sometimes
find
in
this
style
the
hop
choice
was
perfect
d
very
very
drinkable
i
could
see
sharing
a
12
pack
with
friends
and
everyone
being
quite
happy
with
the
choice
pours
a
deep
copper
color
nice
white
head
average
retention
decent
lacing
a
nice

strong

but
the
hops
shine
through
as
one
would
hope
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
level
very
easy
drinking
the
growler
is
half
gone
in
no
time
my
favorite
of
the
regular
schlafly
offerings
even
better
now
that
its
dry
hopped
was
great
on
tap
earlier
in
the
day
and
still
good
at
home
in
the
growler

aside
from
the

this
one
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
glass
will
go
from
full
to
empty
in
no
time
simply
fantastic
thanks
rsyberg01
for
the
opportunity
another
solid
effort
from
this
brewery
this
is
my
third
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
have
not
been
disappointed
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
very
drinkable
this
was
a
nice
bitter
beer
with
some
things
going
on
in
the
background
once
you
got
past
the
initial
shock
of
the
bitterness
this
probably
does
not
fit
in
the
session
beer
category
as
it
is
5
9
alcohol
and
would
take
a
lot
of
work
after
a
couple
i
would
like
to
try
the
on
tap
version
d
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
does
go
down
easy
imnot
sure
i
would
want
that
initial
aroma
to
hit
me
all
night
long
though
another
enjoyable
offering
from
my
favorite
st
louis
brewery
infinitely
preferable
to
patronizing
youknowwho
slightly
hazed
amber
pour
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
slightly
earthy
musty
orange
like
hop
aroma
nice
mild
earthy
hop
flavor
as
well
with
similar
malt
qualities
to
the
schlafly
pilsner
orange
noticed
in
the
taste
as
well
a
nice
pale
ale
overall
top
notch
apa
another
winner
from
schlafly
d
4
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
goto
beer
for
me
drinkability
would
really
like
to
try
this
fresh
from
the
tap
one
of
these
days
if
you
happen
to
be
at
the
tap
room
and
this
is
available
do
not
pass
it
up
d
easy
drinking
so
no
problem
there
very
sessionable
and
if
you
are
in
the
saint
louis
area
there
is
probably
no
better
local
beer
of
this
style
out
there
but
just
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
this
beers
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
citrus
and
pine
hops
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
bitterness
that
hits
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
a
hint
of
malt
backbone
but
the
hops
are
the
stars
of
the
show
the
mouthfeel
was
a
just
a
bit
thinner
than
medium
all
around
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
i
like
the
drinkability
here
so
i
am
going
to
rate
it
pretty
high
would
like
to
go
to
st
louis
someday
and
try
this
fresh
from
the
barrels
good
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
a
little
hint
of
yeast
creamy
mouthfeel
some
caramelly
malt
to
start
off
with
followed
by
a
solid
american
hop
bitterness
good
balance
very
drinkable
beer
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
three
inches
thick
incredible
retention
a
slightly
malty
scent
at
the
front
that
is
soon
followed
by
a
strong
floral
aroma
and
the
scent
of
sweet
citrus
like
an
orange
the
malt
strikes
the
palate
at
the
start
and
stays
with
there
till
it
reaches
halfway
that
is
when
a
citrus
flavors
of
lemon
and
mild
grapefruit
takeover
those
flavors
blend
to
grassy
earthy
finish
a
bit
of
a
watery
start
on
the
feel
it
gains
weight
as
it
crosses
the
palate
to
a
more
medium
bodied
feel
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
strong
aroma
and
solid
flavor
plus
the
low
alchol
make
this
an
excellent
session
beer
this
wasnt
the
freshest
sample
of
this
beer
having
been
bottled
on
92707
it
was
still
a
solid
enough
pale
ale
and
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
sample
medium
bodied
very
easy
to
drink
and
somehow
makes
you
want
another
another
great
brew
from
schlafly
found
this
on
sale
for
5
49
for
a
sixer
at
this
price
a
great
value
not
sure
if
i
would
make
it
a
regular
rotation
at
its
regular
7
99
price
but
i
will
not
be
averse
to
buying
more
the
taste
has
a
good
balance
of
piney
hops
spice
and
pale
malts
its
not
overly
flavorful
but
for
a
pale
ale
its
better
hopwise
than
alot
of
ipas
ive
come
across
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
for
the
style
with
a
crisp
spiced
albeit
a
bit
thin
body
thats
both
refreshing
and
appropriately
carbonated
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
lasting
delightfully
spicy
bitter
hop
finish
drinkability
is
a
bit
limited
simply
by
the
fact
that
id
go
for
a
hoppier
beer
iipa
or
otherwise
if
given
the
choice
but
this
is
an
easy
brew
to
consume
and
one
id
buy
again
without
hesitation
schlafly
gives

king

its

the

is
in

overall
an
easy
drinking
apa
with
no
spectacular
or
horrible
qualities
d
for
a
beer
thats
all
about
the
hops
this
one
is
very
drinkable
it
is
not
balanced
well
with
malt
but
because
most
of
the
hops
are
from
dry
hopping
the
bitterness
is
not
too
bad
this
apa
makes
for
a
good

drinkability
well
it
is
a
good
drinking
apa
but
is
not
very
strong
with
its
aroma
i
find
this
strange
buecause
the
bottle
claims
this
is
dry
hopped
whats
up
with
that
anyway
this
is
a
very
medial
pale
ale
that
is
drinkable
but
not
worth
seeking
out
specifically
overall
this
is
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
well
built
with
an
intentional
nod
to
hop
prominence
solid
easy
drinking

i
had
another

definitely
a

worth
a
try

brew
a
slow
sipper
and
it
went
well
with
some
home
made
fajitas
found
a
sixpack
of
this
at
one
of
the
schnucks
grocery
stores
in
evansville
pours
a
hazy
amber
body
with
a
large

lots
of
clingy

aroma
is
leafy

backed
by

and
red
apples
light
medium
body
with
crisp
carbonation
taste
opens
with
a
leafy
green
hops
bitterness
that
lasts
throughout
but
is
quickly
joined
by
a
note
of
mcintosh
red
apple
fruitiness
that
really
sets
this
ale
apart
toasty
caramel
maltiness
is
subtle
but
balances
quite
well
comes
off
as
a
very
well
balanced
apa
that
is
light
enough
to
session
a
really
pleasant
surprise
here
d
this
is
a
great
apa
it
has
the
powerful
hoppiness
of
a
dipa
but
it
much
lighter
and
very
refreshing
d
this
makes
for
a
great
summer
time
session
beer
under
the
ol
oak
tree
pours
a
really
pretty
light
amber
color
but
looks
a
lot
like
a
lager
has
a
decent
white
cloudy
head
on
it
as
well
smells
great
for
the
first
time
in
a
beer
i
smell
distinctly
apples
and
actually
granny
smith
apples
has
a
tartness
to
it
that
i
can
really
discern
has
some
hoppy
scents
to
it
as
well
tastes
great
like
a
toned
down
ipa
but
with
some
malt
thrown
in
a
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
beer
a
slight
bitterness
with
a
malty
touch
very
good
beer
try
it
if
you
can
get
get
some
this
is
a
really
good
sessionable
apa
i
had
to
ask
if
this
was
different
than
their
earlier
apa
and
was
told
yes
after
tasting
i
could
tell
it
was
different
and
better
enjoy
nice
hoppy
beer
that
is
only
slightly
bitter
i
can
see
why
some
call
it

one
of
my
favorite

apas
a
love
the
flavor
and
taste
of
this
beer
one
of
my
top
three
favorites
favorite
new
glarus
offering
the
best
beer
typically
found
in
their
variety
pack
i
is
say
it
was
above
average
but
not
the
best
a
fantastic
pale
great
aroma
taste
is
very
good
really
nice
hop
profile
light
drinkable
was
definitely
the
best
beer
in
their
variety
pack
just
a
great
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
perfect
in
every
way
excellent
pale
ale
plenty
of
flavour
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
day
love
this
pale
ale
great
everyday
drinking
beer
o
great
brew
from
new
glarus
excellent
session
pale
ale
easy
drinking
and
a
solid
crisp
flavor
so
far
my
favorite
from
them
moon
man
by
new
glarus
is
a
great
flavorable
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
but
not
too
hoppy
if
you
are
the
type
of
person
who
likes
a
little
more
flavor
and
feel
to
your
beer
but
maybe
dont
care
much
for
strong
ipas
give
this
ncpa
no
coast
pale
ale
a
try
i
think
you
will
be
pleasantly
suprised
another
great
beer
from
the
best
midwestern
brewery
in
america
new
glarus
just
remember
you
can
only
buy
new
glarus
beers
in
wisconsin
so
stock
up
when
your
there
as
i
do
or
have
a
friend
grab
some
for
you
whebn
passing
through
best
session
ipa
ive
ever
had
hands
down
i
love
new
glarus
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
nose
spice
grain
clean
malt
graham
cracker
pours
brilliant
gold
under
a
1
white
foam
cap
palate
big
malt
and
graham
cracker
with
fruit
in
the
background
spice
and
a
dose
of
caramel
finishing
with
a
medium
hop
emphasis
medium
boy
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
while
nothing
earth
shattering
this
is
a
pleasant
enjoyable
and
eminently
drinkable
pale
ale
probably
wouldnt
take
this
over
a
snpa
given
a
choice
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
tasty
apa
nice
smooth
light
ipa
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
consider
moon
man
to
be
the
benchmark
of
other
pale
ales
i
have
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
in
the
bottle
always
delicious
the
citrus
hops
in
this
beer
really
shine
it
has
the
perfect
balance
that
keeps
me
going
back
for
more
on
tap
at
the
a
tipsy
cow
poured
with
little
head
nice
fresh
citrus
smell
light
refreshing
taste
some
flavors
of
mango
and
pineapple
pretty
good
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
mixture
of
hops
are
refreshing
with
a
slight
fruity
flavor
whether
its
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
chilly
autumn
one
this
beer
is
perfect
o
nice
pale
ale
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
heavy
citrus
grapefruit
nose
dont
drink
this
one
straight
from
the
bottle
or
youll
miss
the
best
part
get
it
into
a
glass
so
you
can
enjoy
it
o
like
i
said
above
one
of
my
favorite
apas
its
hop
forward
for
sure
but
theres
just
enough
bready
malt
to
keep
it
balanced
and
drinkable
great
beer
my
rating
may
seem
excessively
high
but
considering
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
right
up
near
the
top
for
that
reason
it
gets
the
rating
im
giving
it
if
you
want
a
light
ipa
that
doesnt
taste
like
a
light
ipa
try
a
moon
man
i
have
to
say
for
a
pale
ale
this
was
outstanding
great
hop
flavor
without
quite
being
in
ipa
territory
good
toasty
malt
balance
with
a
west
coast
hop
mentality
for
advertising
no
coasts
i
feel
like
moon
man
took
the
best
of
both
coasts
and
put
it
all
together
into
a
great
beer
an
exceptional
pale
ale
with
a
great
herbal
and
citrus
hop
character
the
hops
also
have
a
bit
of
pine
as
well
giving
complex
american
hop
flavors
there
is
strong
hop
bitterness
and
have
very
little
malt
making
for
a
balance
that
is
firmly
bitter
but
i
was
wrong
the
malt
is
so
well
balanced
that
the
beer
has
a
great
of
almost
a
little
weak
finish
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
it
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
with
a
side
of
cheese
curds
this
could
easily
be
my
summer
goto
its
not
filling
its
refreshing
and
it
is
full
of
interesting
and
tasty
flavors
its
a
gem
my
host
explained
that
new
glarus
beers
are
not
available
outside
of
wisconsin
and
this
is
a
real
shame
i
could
easily
drink
moon
man
for
the
rest
of
summer
if
it
was
available
in
kansas
overall
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
review
before
i
finished
the
bottle
excellent
pale
ale
new
glarus
moon
man
4
55
o
overall
i
was
incredibly
surprised
by
this
brew
moon
man
is
completely
unassuming
and
a
phenomenal
representation
of
the
style
apas
are
my
favorite
and
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
my
list
just
a
phenomenal
beer
a
nice
malty
presence
that
works
nicely
with
the
hops
providing
perhaps
one
of
the
best
balanced
beers
ive
ever
had
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
id
be
drinking
this
every
day
o
in
a
time
when
it
seems
everyone
is
coming
out
with
a
new
session
ipa
new
glarus
moon
man
which
seems
like
one
of
the
originals
looking
back
albeit
a
tad
less
hoppy
stands
tall
amazingly
crushable
this
crisp
and
delightfully
and
delicately
hoppy
beer
continues
to
quench
thirst
and
desire
for
fullflavored
beer
pint
after
pint
overall
an
incredible
apa
and
one
i
would
very
highly
recommend
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
color
and
hop
spectrum
and
to
great
original
effect
moon
man
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
since
the
day
it
was
released
the
hop
profile
simply
shines
in
short
its
aromatic
juicy
and
immensely
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
each
trip
up
nort
just
to
load
up
on
moon
man
verdict
a
lovely
pale
ale
from
new
glarus
refreshing
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
just
enough
hops
to
impart
a
nice
array
of
flavors
but
not
enough
to
cripple
the
beer
with
bitterness
o
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
ive
had
so
much
flavor
yet
so
light
and
crushable
inhale
deeply
crush
and
repeat
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
drank
it
has
turned
me
onto
american
pale
ales
and
im
very
excited
to
try
more
beers
in
this
catagory
to
compare
i
enjoy
this
beer
at
many
locations
and
times
but
standing
at
a
hot
grill
with
a
moon
man
is
my
favorite
o
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
pale
ale
that
should
be
drank
on
a
summer
day
really
refreshing
and
the
flavor
dies
off
fast
leaving
you
wanting
to
take
another
sip
my
only
complaint
if
their
was
one
is
that
the
flavor
is
not
quit
as
strong
as
what
the
aroma
was
suggesting
if
you
want
a
nice
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
day
and
you
like
the
hopped
up
beers
give
this
one
a
go
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
cheers
overall
a
very
light
pale
ale
but
not
a
bad
thing

this
is
an

to
have
a

of
very
good
offering
from
a

wish
i
could
get
more
often

would
have
led
me
to
believe

it
was
still

lightmedium

easy

nicely

a
good
simple
pale
ale
o
very
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
on
the
finish
really
keeps
you
sipping
on
this
one
this
is
much
closer
to
a
pilsener
than
many
of
the
pale
ales
that
i
have
typically
enjoyed
the
most
but
the
malt
profile
is
also
much
less
wheaty
and
prominent
than
the
pale
ales
i
have
enjoyed
the
least
this
finds
a
unique
space
and
nice
balance
for
itself
and
is
really
a
nice
beer
id
probably
not
seek
this
out
specifically
in
trade
but
would
absolutely
purchase
it
as
an
everyday
sort
of
beer
if
it
were
readily
available
the
aroma
that
i
get
from
this
beer
is
very
interesting
others
note
fruit
and
i
get
a
little
of
that
but
honestly
the
thing
that
sticks
out
to
me
is
a
kind
of
aroma
of
cheddar
not
saying
that
just
to
make
fun
of
wisconsin
this
by
the
way
is
not
a
criticism
it
makes
me
want
to
run
up
and
grab
a
block
of
cheese
to
serve
with
it
hop
scent
is
muted
i
cant
pick
out
the
varieties
but
with
a
little
swirl
of
the
bottle
theres
some
pine
and
a
little
floweriness
coming
through
it
has
a
good
robust
feel
in
the
mouth
with
some
maltiness
for
balance
at
the
end
i
do
not
get
a
particularly
clean
finish
from
this
beer
but
i
think
thats
ok
as
it
really
is
begging
to
be
consumed
in
quantities
greater
than
one
all
around
a
good
solid
brew
from
new
glarus
o
excellent
complex
beer
if
i
lived
in
winsconson
this
would
be
my
go
to
beer
year
round
love
it
overall
nice
sessionable
apa
flavourful
and
tasty
enough
this
is
probably
the
best
wisconsinproduced
apa
ive
come
across
so
far
in
5
years
living
in
wisconsin
it
stands
up
fairly
well
to
the
more
popular
apas
especially
when
it
comes
to
pricing
o
a
great
session
pale
ale
for
sure
an
interesting
balance
of
flavors
that
is
more
complex
than
i
expected
87
overall
the
best
thing
about
moon
man
is
his
nose
this
aspect
of
it
really
showcases
the
five
varieties
of
hops
used
here
each
taking
a
bit
of
their
own
turn
in
the
spotlight
while
appreciating
the
collaboration
of
the
event
as
well
the
flavoring
followed
well
but
lacked
a
certain
punch
and
zing
so
favorable
to
the
aroma
this
was
likely
helped
along
by
the
lightness
of
the
thing
the
feel
is
exquisitely
clean
and
airy
bordering
on
thin
and
watered
at
times
but
saved
by
the
fullness
in
flavoring
to
reiterate
what
is
advertised
on
the
bottle
drink
this
one
fresh
you
will
get
such
a
different
experience
perhaps
that
is
one
detriment
that
its
longevity
is
quite
low
either
way
we
are
so
happy
to
have
finally
sipped
back
on
some
new
glarus
swill
and
we
are
glad
that
this
tasty
offering
was
our
initiation
taste
doesnt
disappoint
although
is
more
restrained
in
a
way
i
suppose
the
grapefruit
notes
are
certainly
present
without
question
theres
a
bready
grain
backing
it
up
as
well
whats
remarkable
to
me
is
how
theres
basically
no
finish
its
just
clean
nothing
lingers
its
just
cut
off
whether
or
not
a
person
wants
a
crisp
finish
will
determine
if
thats
favorable
or
not
i
found
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
overall
an
extremely
excellent
pale
ale
that
id
recommend
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
an
apa
and
has
access
to
wisconsin
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
ever
tried
overall
a
solid
pale
id
love
to
have
around
for
the
summer
months
and
anytime
really
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
very
clean
crisp
and
easy
drinking
if
it
wasnt
for
the
mineral
notes
across
the
nose
i
would
rate
this
higher
but
as
far
as
everyday
easy
drinking
pales
go
i
would
probably
have
this
as
a
standby
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
i
may
have
just
found
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
i
couldnt
stop
smelling
this
beer
at
first
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
6
of
these
without
notice
witch
could
be
attributed
to
the
light
abv
cannot
get
this
in
minnesota
bummer
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden

with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
nice
aroma
of
tropical

great

light
sweet
biscuit

lemon
citrus
light
tropical
fruit
with
a
mild
hop
finish
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
deceptively
subtle
with
all
the
flavors
somewhat
subdued
but
the
balance
and
taste
are
quite
excellent
one
of
the
quieter
but
most
enjoyable
pale
ales
ive
had
o
this
is
a
fantastic
apa
that
is
damn
near
the
best
in
its
category
for
those
who
prefer
the
style
without
heavy
bitterness
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
overall
this
was
alright
a
little
light
on
flavor
for
my
tastes
overall
wow
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
looks
like
there
is
a
trip
to
wisconsin
in
the
future
a
no
frills
american
pale
ale
does
what
the
bottle
says
and
doesnt
pull
toward
any
type
its
a
quality
drinkable
pale
ale
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
new
glarus
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
semi
translucent
orange
yellow
with
a
white
head
smells
of
flowery
and
citrus
hops
very
sweet
and
very
inviting
tastes
of
earthy
and
citrus
hops
with
nice
grain
backbone
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
very
nicely
balanced
beer
very
nice
hops
notes
smooth
taste
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
that
would
be
great
staple
to
anyones
fridge
especially
for
the
price

i
was
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
malt
it
tastes
very
much
like
a
light
beer
i
would
of
given
this
ale
a
much
higher
rating
if
the
brewer
would
add
more
malt
and
give
the
beer
more
body
this
would
be
a
good
summer
drink
and
i
might
buy
it
again
great
pale
ale
well
done
without
any
of
the
bells
and
whistles
refreshing
to
say
the
least
i
am
definitely
going
to
buy
again
another
solid
entry
from
new
glarus
despite
the
lackluster
taste
i
like
that
its
approachable
to
those
new
to
the
style
or
those
finally
exploring
the
world
beyond
the
domestic
lager
a
very
drinkable
session
pale
ale
by
the
way
i
like
the
humor
of
no
coast
pale
ale
on
the
label
o
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
you
know
the
rest
cheers
overall
easy
going
mouthfeel
incredibly
drinkable
maybe
my
over
stimulated
palate
just
wanted
more
going
on
here
but
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
not
one
of
new
glarus
best
offerings
but
worth
a
try
its
sessionable
and
a
flavorful
one
i
like
it
wish
my
sampler
pack
had
more
of
these
in
it
o
a
clean
and
freshtasting
pale
ale
very
nice
othis
is
nice
everyday
beer
it
is
quaffable
but
not
boring
or
insubstantial
and
the
5
abv
allows
for
more
than
one
beer
in
a
sitting
without
trouble
its
a
true
session
beer
that
being
said
i
keep
getting
an
offputting
onion
note
that
creeps
in
with
every
other
sip
that
drags
the
smell
and
taste
scores
down
without
that
goofy
note
this
would
rank
much
higher
in
my
book
very
sessionable
goes
down
quick
lakes
region
really
seems
to
know
their
way
around
a
hop
cone
i
dont
know
whats
up
with
my
taste
buds
but
ive
got
to
downgrade
this
beer
from
4
43
to
4
26
its
still
an
exceptional
small
beer
but
now
that
ive
had
the
greatness
of
ng
stone
soup
moon
man
pales
somewhat
overall
an
outstanding
pale
ale
very
much
recommended
straw
yellow
to
gold
in
color
brilliant
clarity
an
inch
of
white
foam
rests
on
top
cereal
grain
aroma
is
prevalent
i
get
a
bit
of
some
floral
hop
aroma
too
thats
pretty
much
what
im
getting
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
neutral
this
is
a
pretty
basic
beer
with
no
frills
o
this
is
really
good
taste
is
great
the
aroma
is
juicy
and
woodsy
very
nice
and
once
again
not
overly
done
new
glarus
can
make
some
damn
tasty
yet
simple
and
mild
beers
o
good
surprised
by
this
one
expected
the
hops
to
be
more
subdued
its
no
ipa
to
be
sure
but
man
this
is
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
and
the
hops
are
definitely
more
about
juicy
and
floral
characteristics
than
pure
bitterness
im
impressed
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
amount
of
head
the
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
the
lacing
sticks
very
nicely
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
has
a
mild
resiny
citrus
hop
note
to
it
with
plenty
of
malt
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
fabulous
light
wellcarbonated
with
great
flavor
but
not
a
big
beer
incredibly
drinkable
mild
hops
that
are
only
barely
bitter
citrusy
and
a
great
mild
malt
backbone
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
i
do
not
have
more
on
this
hot
day
overall
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
a
can
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
take
camping
canoeing
or
to
the
beach
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
rocky
white
head
that
leaves
chunky
lacing
smell
is
light
crisp
bready
malt
with
lots
of
juicy
citrus
fruit
hops
loads
of
floral
scents
as
well
a
delicious
smelling
pale
ale
taste
is
clean
crisp
crackery
malt
with
light
citrusey
hop
flavors
giving
light
bitterness
to
the
nice
clean
slightly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamysmooth
really
fine
carbonation
awesome
apa
here
glad
i
got
two
more
in
the
variety
pack
o
i
was
greatly
impressed
with
this
beer
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
expecting
much
it
had
great
flavor
for
a
pale
ale
new
glarus
has
some
fantastic
beers
o
excellent
apa
from
new
glarus
almost
3
months
old
but
holds
up
really
well
cheers
moon
man
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
the
aroma
and
the
taste
are
both
strong
on
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
crackery
malt
on
the
taste
very
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
wisconsionites
are
lucky
to
have
this
everywhere
especially
during
the
summer
great
great
beer
wish
it
was
distributed
outside
of
wi
5
hops
flowery
nose
grapefruitforward
taste
little
acidity
pale
with
a
nice
golden
hue
larger
size
bubbles
form
a
great
white
top
tasteful
and
reserved
labeling
no
abv
indicated
on
bottle
overall
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
have
had
another
3
a
true
pale
by
definition
but
i
wouldnt
have
minded
a
bit
more
linger
on
the
finish
this
missed
the
mark
for
me
something
about
it
is
medicinal
it
pours
with
virtually
no
head
and
retains
none
hardly
any
nose
either
i
struggled
to
get
past
the
medicinal
taste
but
simply
couldnt
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
it
certainly
wasnt
pleasurable
and
ended
up
being
a
drainpour
a
comfort
to
drink
a
good
stepping
stone
ipa
for
noobs
but
still
great
for
ipa
nuts
well
balanced
not
very
hoppy
with
some
nice
apple
flavors
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
and
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
some
slight
sticky
hop
oils
overall
moon
man
is
yet
another
wellexecuted
beer
from
new
glarus
nothing
too
unique
but
at
a
sessionable
5
this
apa
has
quite
a
lot
of
flavor
theyre
not
trying
to
reinvent
the
wheel
here
and
thats
ok
what
theyve
done
instead
is
created
a
tasty
pale
ale
thats
extremely
wellbalanced
and
incredibly
smooth
im
a
huge
apa
and
ipa
fan
but
for
some
reason
i
prefer
new
glarus
lagers
and
maltier
ales
to
their
hoppy
beers
still
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
brew
and
a
solid
take
on
the
style
overall
a
well
executed
pale
ale
a
definite
summer
time
session
beer
citric
hop
flavors
balance
with
toasted
cracker
malts
and
some
unmalted
barley
flavors
the
finish
is
very
thin
almost
watery
palate
it
seems
still
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
o
a
really
easy
drinking
pale
ale
like
most
of
their
offerings
seems
to
have
something
really
nice
about
their
malt
profile
not
as
bold
as
id
typically
look
for
but
a
nice
pale
ale
othis
beer
probably
lost
some
of
its
hop
profile
due
to
it
being
brewed
at
the
beginning
of
december
still
is
a
really
nice
beer
really
notice
the
nice
bready
aftertaste
this
is
probably
a
tad
more
pronounced
since
it
is
an
older
beer
overall
not
too
bad
would
be
a
nice
pale
oil
to
enjoy
on
a
summer
day
not
as
harsh
on
the
palate
as
say
a
zombie
dust
pours
clear
gold
with
what
at
first
seems
like
minimal
carbonation
but
with
a
more
vigorous
pour
a
pretty
white
head
forms
and
never
really
goes
away
each
sip
seems
to
leave
more
and
more
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
hugely
citrus
aroma
i
especially
get
lemons
and
a
bit
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
full
of
citrus
as
well
suggesting
a
fresh
leafy
hoppiness
that
i
quite
like
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
somewhat
muted
but
definitely
there
its
just
not
as
assertive
as
some
other
american
pale
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
the
finish
is
quite
fruity
and
a
touch
dry
the
citrus
aroma
and
flavor
in
some
ways
reminds
me
of
three
floyds
gumballhead
all
of
these
qualities
make
moon
man
an
exceptionally
drinkable
ale
no
date
on
bottle
and
i
would
guess
this
is
over
3
months
old
i
had
some
earlier
this
year
and
actually
had
a
score
of
4
2
friend
of
mine
just
brought
these
down
i
would
love
to
try
another
for
sure
but
for
right
now
its
nothing
i
would
buy
this
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
rich
with
bitter
hops
and
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
fairly
light
and
smooth
as
far
as
the
hops
go
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
moon
man
is
good
the
way
it
is
but
boy
it
should
would
be
amazing
to
see
this
beer
with
a
little
thicker
volume
and
hopped
up
clean
refreshing
and
delicious
just
the
way
new
glarus
makes
em
i
cant
imagine
a
better
apa
than
this
super
drinkable
and
sessionable
huge
grassy
piney
and
citrusy
nose
right
out
of
the
bottle
the
taste
is
sublime
all
the
notes
of
your
favorite
dipa
dialed
down
into
a
sessionable
format
the
mouthfeel
is
very
round
and
easy
to
drink
again
and
again
its
got
just
enough
malt
sweetness
to
appeal
to
folks
that
avoid
hoppy
brews
too
i
could
stock
this
for
the
entire
summer
and
be
happy
a
great
great
session
beer
drinkable
in
every
way
pours
a
relaxed
pale
color
with
a
little
more
than
an
inch
of
white
foamy
head
the
nose
is
balanced
between
american
pale
malt
and
bittering
hops
nothing
to
distinct
about
the
hops
here
ale
yeast
is
obvious
providing
some
toasted
biscuit
notes
the
flavor
too
is
quite
yeasty
for
an
american
pale
ale
and
i
like
it
in
this
case
bittering
hops
on
the
back
end
fresh
wholegrain
toast
on
the
front
end
dry
mouthfeel
average
carbonation
and
just
a
little
thin
in
terms
of
body
there
is
nothing
too
unique
about
this
beer
maybe
the
stronger
yeast
presence
but
this
is
an
all
day
every
day
kind
of
session
beer
perfect
in
all
seasons
at
any
time
a
delightful
beer
to
drink
in
high
quantities
grapefruit
in
a
glass
with
some
toast
o
great
beer
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
across
the
board
if
you
ask
me
very
drinkable
but
not
boring
a
side
note
i
refuse
to
rate
appearance
so
every
beer
gets
the
same
score
as
overall
smell
taste
and
mouth
are
the
only
things
that
truly
matter
when
rating
a
beer
picked
up
a
sixer
at
casanova
in
hudson
wi
new
glarus
calls
this
a
session
beer
and
while
i
like
my
session
beers
less
than
5
abv
this
is
close
enough
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
juicy
with
mild
floral
and
tangerine
the
finishing
bitterness
is
relatively
mild
really
on
par
with
some
blonde
or
amber
ales
the
body
is
a
touch
light
for
a
pale
ale
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
more
drinkable
and
it
is
check
it
out
next
time
youre
in
sconie
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
rivals
the
west
coast
pale
ales
and
ipas
the
body
being
small
only
helps
it
be
a
great
drinker
the
body
and
the
malt
character
is
a
great
platform
that
allows
the
hops
to
stand
out
in
the
delicate
dance
of
malts
and
hops
i
cant
believe
i
can
buy
this
is
a
6pack
for
7
37
with
tax
that
just
blows
my
mind
ive
had
bombers
that
cost
more
than
a
6er
of
this
and
they
cant
even
come
close
to
this
level
of
awesome
overall
a
very
good
version
of
an
american
pale
ale
very
nice
use
of
hops
great
option
for
a
lighter
feeling
hoppy
beer
c
visiting
the
folks
back
in
wisconsin
i
picked
up
a
six
of
moon
man
not
sure
what
moon
man
is
all
about
but
hey
im
in
it
for
the
beer
nice
citrus
aroma
odd
for
a
pale
ale
the
hops
are
up
front
in
the
flavor
some
nice
malt
follows
then
comes
a
watery
finish
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
up
to
the
pale
ales
available
in
the
colorado
front
range
the
taste
is
well
indescribable
perfect
balance
when
it
comes
to
the
hops
malts
and
wheatbarley
my
go
to
pale
ale
is
summits
e
p
a
most
pale
ales
are
either
not
hoppy
enough
or
too
hoppy
and
should
be
classified
as
an
i
p
a
this
is
perfect
in
every
aspect
not
only
as
a
pale
ale
but
as
a
easy
to
drink
everyday
sessionable
brew
awesome
if
there
is
a
better
pale
ale
out
there
show
me
i
love
this
beer
wish
i
didnt
have
to
visit
my
inlaws
to
get
it
also
wish
that
i
could
get
this
in
a
12
pack
instead
of
just
a
six
sooo
gooody
goooosh
good
whatever
that
means
buy
it
try
it
love
it
i
really
like
this
beer
happy
i
finally
tried
it
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
smell
is
the
definite
highlight
but
everything
else
works
together
quite
well
refreshing
smooth
and
clean
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
some
lacing
to
it
the
aroma
is
nice
mainly
a
lighter
pine
and
grapefruit
hop
nose
it
has
a
very
nice
taste
to
it
a
nice
upfront
flavor
of
pine
and
grapefruit
hops
but
not
too
strong
or
overly
bitter
medium
bodied
clean
and
refreshing
a
good
choice
pours
light
copper
cloudy
with
14
inch
of
white
foam
hoppy
nose
swirling
blend
nose
taste
is
a
thin
nonnonsense
malt
with
a
subtle
hop
bump
one
of
the
lightest
pales
ive
ever
had
simple
yet
elegant
quite
good
actually
simplicity
counts
for
something
o
textbook
apa
w
an
easytosession
taste
and
abv
level
this
is
an
amazing
brew
and
i
hope
wisconsinites
dont
take
it
for
granted
o
this
beer
could
use
a
little
better
head
retention
piney
hops
could
easily
rival
the
hoppiest
of
double
ipas
i
loved
the
citrus
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
for
a
beer
that
labels
itself
as
no
coast
pale
ale
maybe
a
little
west
coast
i
thought
this
beer
was
super
one
sided
with
little
malt
character
to
restrain
the
hops
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
i
have
to
believe
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
simcoe
hops
thankfullythis
will
now
be
my
go
to
beer
as
i
am
lucky
enough
to
live
in
wisconsin
m
lighter
body
with
an
extremely
crisp
refreshing
finish
i
wish
i
had
gotten
my
hands
on
this
one
earlier
in
the
summer
low
abv
makes
this
one
a
perfect
session
beer
o
very
easydrinking
and
one
of
the
most
readily
available
apas
here
in
wi
one
of
my
favorites
from
ng
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
wouldnt
rank
this
among
the
objective
best
but
its
certainly
got
something
i
love
about
it
im
disappointed
that
i
wont
be
able
to
get
it
again
for
a
long
while
but
ill
certainly
pick
up
a
few
six
packs
the
next
time
i
swing
through
wi
mouthfeel
average
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
o
very
nice
little
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
pa
the
hops
are
mostly
fruit
and
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
not
malt
dominated
so
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
hey
look
just
another
outstanding
beer
brewed
by
dan
himself
o
nice
pale
ale
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
citrus
notes
exceedingly
drinkable
super
smooth
and
full
o
flavor
bravo
pours
a
deep
clear
clean
yellowish
color
with
fading
head
and
little
lacing
nose
is
complex
with
clean
bright
fruit
notes
some
the
standard
citrus
passion
and
pine
but
some
that
i
just
cant
easily
describe
and
pin
downone
of
the
more
distinctive
noses
in
a
beer
that
i
have
tried
tastes
is
light
malt
first
with
assertive
but
not
strong
hop
character
but
under
as
expected
and
ipa
the
balance
is
really
terrific
somewhat
dry
and
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
the
carbonation
big
but
not
too
somewhat
scrubbing
but
not
aggressively
so
overall
a
terrific
offering
and
my
favorite
of
the
small
hoard
of
new
glarus
brews
ive
tried
highly
sessionable
i
would
think
definitely
glad
i
emptied
my
wallet
on
this
and
would
so
again
overall
it
is
an
above
average
beer
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
someone
just
starting
to
drink
pale
ale
or
ipa
but
still
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
overall
very
nice
pale
ale
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
o
good
ballpark
craft
offering
and
glad
to
try
another
new
glarus
beer
not
a
standout
but
certainly
a
quality
beer
overall
a
nice
simple
and
clean
pale
ale
that
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
o
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
nice
subtle
flavors
and
nothing
is
really
in
your
face
which
i
definitely
appreciate
having
zombie
dust
one
hour
south
daisy
cutter
in
the
city
and
having
this
one
hour
north
is
a
very
good
thing
highly
recommend
this
is
light
flavored
easy
to
drink
smooth
pale
ale
with
a
good
floral
hop
character
its
not
incredible
interesting
but
it
is
better
than
a
lot
of
other
pale
ales
out
there
poured
into
a
pint
glass
light
golden
color
with
an
inch
head
it
smells
of
hops
and
grapefruit
the
hoppy
taste
from
the
five
varieties
they
include
is
what
does
it
for
me
not
bitter
at
all
fresh
bright
and
drinkable
honestly
one
of
my
favorite
new
glarus
beers
an
awesome
example
of
an
apa
proscht
3
5
d
tasty
but
standard
variety
of
pale
ale
o
really
enjoyable
tasty
low
abv
yet
complex
nothing
is
out
of
balance
it
fits
the
apa
style
perfectly
pale
straw
color
clean
with
little
head
scent
is
pale
and
has
some
notes
of
citrus
and
freshly
dried
straw
with
a
touch
of
flowers
and
sweetness
taste
brings
a
kiss
of
citrus
clean
fresh
dried
grain
light
fruity
sweetness
light
bodied
touch
low
on
carbonation
maybe
too
clean
of
a
pale
ale
for
my
tastes
overall
this
one
blew
my
socks
off
went
into
it
without
any
real
expectations
and
was
thoroughly
impressed
as
one
of
my
first
new
glarus
brews
this
one
definitely
makes
a
positive
impression
it
was
a
little
thin
and
didnt
keep
much
head
but
its
a
perfect
summer
apa
if
i
was
able
to
id
buy
this
all
the
time
im
a
big
fan
of
new
glarus
and
am
surprised
that
i
havent
had
this
yet
i
try
to
stay
away
from
new
ipas
and
apas
because
there
are
so
many
that
its
easy
to
be
disappointed
this
will
not
disappoint
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
is
a
bit
light
on
the
malt
for
a
true
apa
almost
like
a
light
ipa
while
it
is
very
drinkable
i
prefer
a
bit
more
body
and
flavor
in
my
apas
i
love
the
hop
profile
though
never
had
an
apa
with
so
much
grapefruit
flavor
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
recommended
to
any
who
can
find
it
cheers
overallthis
is
an
impressive
brew
from
the
usually
spoton
new
glarus
company
it
is
a
choice
beer
for
spring
and
summer
as
its
refreshing
citrusy
smooth
and
most
importantly
drinkable
nature
screams
to
be
enjoyed
on
the
porch
on
a
sunny
60º
day
additionally
because
of
its
relatively
low

is
a
great
session
beer
as

d
easy

great
start

i
love
the
beers
citrus
and
floral
hop
nose
which
is
complimented
the
beers
flavor
characteristics
you
will
not
be
disappointed
o
very
nice
drinkable
apa
nothing
especially
characteristic
besides
its
nice
balance
interesting
pale
inviting
aroma
and
it
all
comes
together
for
a
clean
drinkable
beer
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavor
theres
a
nagging
feeling
that
the
intensity
of
this
beer
could
be
ramped
up
to
make
it
even
better
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
head
settles
a
bit
leaving
a
white
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
much
more
impressive
than
i
expected
the
nose
is
loaded
with
dry
hoppy
citrus
aromas
it
smell
wonderful
honestly
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
solid
bitterness
to
it
that
is
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
lighter
body
and
a
solid
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
new
glarus
beers
ive
had
out
of
their
year
round
releases
i
would
drink
a
ton
of
these
if
i
could
get
my
hand
on
them
another
98
for
the
folks
at
new
glarus
glad
i
made
the
trip
to
cross
the
border
m
great
flow
and
coating
impressive
lingering
tastes
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
one
of
the
better
pales
ive
had
great
hop
flavor
but
not
overdone
light
crisp
refreshing
very
bright
tasting
would
be
great
during
the
summer
months
moon
man
pours
a
light
bodied
very
bright
and
clear
yellow
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
fresh
and
full
of
fruity
hops
it
has
some
nectarine
and
mango
to
it
i
love
it
the
flavors
too
are
very
fresh
and
fruity
the
hops
are
all
over
but
not
overbearing
at
all
there
is
plenty
of
fruit
character
with
plenty
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
it
has
low
bitterness
and
is
pretty
refreshing
the
lighter
body
is
perfect
for
this
beer
it
is
extremely
sessionable
overall
this
is
definitely
in
the
upper
echelon
of
pale
ales
i
see
it
as
a
great
warmer
weather
pale
perfect
for
the
pool
or
a
cookout
a
top
quality
american
pale
ale
from
a
remarkable
wisconsin
brewery
kudos
to
new
glarus
master
brewer
dan
carey
o
delicious
pale
ale
lowtomedium
abv
but
with
a
great
burst
of
flavors
extremely
drinkable
all
day
long
this
imo
is
a
perfect
pale
i
doubt
i
will
ever
have
a
better
pale
but
i
hope
i
can
because
it
must
taste
insane
fresh
hops
and
malt
on
the
nose
smells
and
tastes
balanced
but
the
hops
are
the
star
juicy
citrus
with
notes
of
orange
and
a
bit
of
pine
very
easy
drinker
as
it
should
be
at
5
not
a
sign
of
off
putting
tastes
this
is
a
keeper
hope
it
keeps
coming
out
o
very
good
session
beer
the
brewers
dont
try
to
overpower
the
drink
with
hops
this
is
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
and
i
highly
recommend
it
as
always
i
am
jealous
of
wisconsinites
d
excellent
drinkability
great
session
beer
very
nice
for
style
o
very
unique
it
has
similarities
to
hard
ciders
that
truly
surprised
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
very
strange
take
on
a
very
standard
style
great
beer
for
people
to
start
into
craft
with
i
would
think
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
very
refreshing
i
imagine
it
would
be
bliss
on
draft
o
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
definitely
a
sessionable
easy
drinking
pale
ale
not
to
huge
on
the
hops
but
just
the
right
amount
of
character
o
this
is
a
really
nice
drinker
that
doesnt
try
to
clobber
you
with
hops
or
hop
character
but
your
hop
craving
is
satisfied
it
goes
down
smooth
and
mellow
and
doesnt
fatigue
the
palate
glad
i
tried
it
colored
like
clear
golden
sunshine
with
a
persistant
foam
collar
that
leaves
behind
better
than
average
curtains
of
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
smells
at
first
mostly
of
herbal
hop
pine
resin
combination
with
the
emphasis
put
on
the
herbals
as
it
warms
i
can
start
to
detect
notes
of
a
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
tiny
whisper
of
cannabis
hop
aroma
i
taste
mostly
citric
peel
floral
flavors
midsip
and
a
softpedaled
finish
of
gentle
pine
resin
that
lingers
for
a
nice
while
just
barely
enough
malt
in
the
flavor
comes
through
to
balance
this
apa
is
definitely
hop
focused
texture
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
mediumlight
bodied
with
an
extended
finish
that
gradually
dries
out
as
it
progresses
a
better
than
average
apa
overall
a
soft
nose
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
a
laidback
and
invigorating
palate
of
sweet
and
bitter
hop
flavors
and
a
feel
that
instantly
leaves
you
wanting
more
moon
man
is
a
beer
that
is
a
privilege
to
slowly
savor
and
abide
with
o
i
feel
bad
for
hating
on
all
of
jegross2
beer
so
far
its
an
above
average
apa
overall
another
great
brew
by
ng
brewed
year
round
and
for
a
great
price
this
one
is
a
fav
of
mine
to
come
back
to
another
solid
every
day
beer
from
new
glarus
thanks
to
sonoma01
for
the
bottle
and
the
many
more
to
come
o
like
its
appearance
this
offering
is
delicate
and
transparent
and
i
dont
think
it
lends
itself
well
to
a
detailed
analysis
the
hops
are
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
brief
will
it
furrow
your
brow
and
blow
you
away
probably
not
but
i
would
happily
down
a
few
of
these
any
time
under
a
sunny
sky
preferably
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
pale
ale
well
balanced
and
quite
easy
to
drink
id
be
happy
to
have
another
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
from
new
glarus
o
i
had
this
beer
back
on
tour
a
few
years
ago
but
dont
really
remember
it
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
taste
it
again
its
better
than
i
obviously
remember
though
i
remember
favoring
it
out
of
the
sampler
pack
back
then
as
well
11162011
o
probably
past
its
prime
but
still
a
good
apa
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
o
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
it
enjoyed
the
hop
profile
and
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
very
bitter
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
reconsidered
on
123113
delicious
hoppy
but
balanced
malt
never
too
bitter
the
finish
coasts
on
with
a
sort
of
christmas
spice
note
lingering
not
overly
carbonated
which
is
good
in
my
book
when
theres
real
flavor
in
a
beer
no
point
in
hiding
it
possibly
the
best
pale
ive
had
cost
9
99
for
a
six
pack
o
like
i
said
it
resembles
a
down
scaled
pliny
i
would
be
very
interested
to
try
some
of
new
glarus
ipas
as
i
think
a
stronger
version
of
such
a
beer
would
rival
pliny
that
being
said
given
that
this
a
pale
ale
and
not
am
ipa
the
only
thing
i
wish
it
had
more
of
is
aroma
but
perhaps
this
is
due
to
style
as
well
great
beer
overall
and
i
will
be
hoarding
the
few
of
these
in
my
variety
pack
the
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
wispy
cap
of
foam
citrus
and
pine
whack
the
nose
the
hops
continues
to
be
the
main
theme
on
palate
some
malt
notes
counterbalance
the
hops
are
aggressive
and
tasty
but
a
bit
more
interplay
with
the
malt
would
be
welcome
overall
a
good
beer
highly
drinkable
solid
allround
offering
here
nice
interplay
of
hops
both
floral
and
herbal
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
crackery
malt
surpisingly
dry
toward
the
finish
but
without
astringency
or
acidity
highly
drinkable
with
a
sessionfriendly
abv
too
bad
this
isnt
available
for
me
locally
at
it
would
be
in
regular
rotation
biscuity
flavors
balance
out
the
grapefruit
citrus
crispness
on
teh
back
end
is
tremendous
yum
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
golden
yellow
body
with
little
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
herbal
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
very
crisp
taste
the
citrus
very
well
balanced
of
hops
and
malts
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
and
over
all
a
great
beer
o
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
what
a
great
session
beer
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
in
it
next
time
im
in
wisconsin
ill
forget
about
the
mix
six
and
bring
home
a
whole
case
of
this
stuff
its
that
good
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
o
a
very
nice
sessionable
brew
easy
to
drink
but
very
tasty
without
being
too
complex
a
great
effort
this
o
one
of
my
favorite
tasting
pale
ales
i
could
definetely
do
a
session
with
this
stuff
what
a
good
session
that
would
be
overall
i
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
little
thinner
than
the
smell
would
indicate
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
easily
do
a
session
with
this
one
a
very
decent
apa
golden
with
a
halfinch
of
white
foam
smell
is
slightly
pine
resin
and
a
biscuitlike
maltiness
taste
is
more
pine
resins
nut
bread
and
biscuits
somewhat
watery
tastebody
is
unappealing
body
is
light
with
ample
carbonation
overall
is
drinkable
certainly
but
there
are
far
better
apas
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
for
long
sessions
or
warm
weather
i
would
recommend
this
to
those
whom
are
looking
for
a
nice
introduction
to
pale
ales
id
say
this
is
definitely
the
better
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
lots
of
character
its
a
pretty
gold
color
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
aroma
is
dominated
by
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
has
a
large
hop
presence
but
it
seems
dryer
than
the
smell
with
little
else
noticeable
the
body
is
good
and
it
goes
down
a
mild
tartness
thats
pleasing
another
winner
from
the
land
of
beer
and
cheese
o
this
is
a
good
lighter
bodied
lighter
flavored
ale
that
delivers
a
citrusy
hop
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
not
too
overbearing
this
is
a
very
refreshing
ale
i
would
call
it
a
lawnmower
pale
ale
even
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
the
hoppier
side
of
the
beer
world
or
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
hops
that
wont
ruin
your
palate
o
very
good
stuff
i
havent
tried
that
many
apas
yet
but
this
one
ranks
very
high
good
stuff
overall
overall
this
brew
is
a
bit
drier
than
i
prefer
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
excessively
so
the
hop
profile
is
wonderful
and
this
one
actually
closely
resembles
half
acre
daisy
cutter
iirc
definitely
a
highlysessionable
apa
overall
its
a
great
apa
almost
ipa
level
but
not
quite
since
its
not
super
bitter
great
tropical
fruits
nice
aromas
just
enough
sweetness
perhaps
a
touch
more
body
would
help
but
otherwise
very
nice
its
slightly
cloudy
a
pale
yellow
with
nice
lacing
the
bouquet
is
great
floral
as
is
the
taste
my
son
was
drinking
the
same
stuff
as
me
and
his
comment
was
that
we
should
have
bought
more
than
two
bottles
of
this
we
could
and
maybe
drag
a
lot
of
it
south
with
us
when
we
head
home
in
a
couple
days
its
great
i
am
beginning
to
like
wisconsin
microbrews
a
lot
o
this
is
a
delicious
brew
once
again
from
new
glarus
its
easy
to
drink
tastes
great
and
would
pair
well
with
a
number
of
meals
in
addition
it
would
be
a
great
brew
for
the
game
sadly
i
believe
this
is
still
only
available
in
wisconsin
check
it
out
if
you
can
overall
in
my
eyes
this
is
wisconsins
daisy
cutter
it
has
that
great
asprinhop
quality
in
a
session
strength
pale
very
good
but
daisy
cutter
is
still
king
o
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
pale
might
be
the
best
pale
i
have
had
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
hopforward
apa
high
on
citrus
and
bitterness
if
it
were
more
widely
available
it
would
be
one
to
seek
out
when
the
craving
for
those
flavors
arrives
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
citrus
flavors
a
mild
weedlike
dankness
more
intense
than
on
the
nose
the
hop
character
is
beautifully
captured
here
with
a
perfect
balance
between
flavor
and
bitterness
for
the
style
at
least
orange
peel
lemon
a
little
bit
of
a
leafychalky
character
i
usually
find
in
cascadehopped
beers
are
all
present
here
the
midpalate
has
a
little
bit
of
honey
graham
crackers
and
some
wheatlike
flavor
while
great
up
until
this
point
the
finish
is
a
little
lacking
a
little
watery
this
character
is
amplified
by
the
lower
level
of
bitterness
and
hop
resin
even
for
an
apa
drying
and
moderately
carbonated
with
a
wisp
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
carbonic
acid
this
beer
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
pretty
bangin
pale
ale
overall
with
fairly
aggressive
hop
bitterness
that
retains
amazing
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
from
new
glarus
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
o
a
great
offering
and
definitely
a
brew
i
will
make
a
point
of
grabbing
the
next
time
i
visit
the
us
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
anyone
could
rate
this
as
subpar
overall
a
nice
surprise
wonderfully
delicious
would
love
to
find
this
one
again
and
buy
unfortunately
unavailable
in
my
area
as
my
brotherinlaw
brought
it
back
from
wisconsin
on
his
visit
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
this
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
extremely
drinkable
this
could
be
a
nice
sessionable
apa
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
that
blew
me
out
of
the
water
this
is
nice
for
some
football
saturdays
but
wont
be
grabbing
it
again
on
my
next
trip
to
wisconsin
pours
light
yellow
with
a
decent
head
and
great
lacing
down
the
sides
smells
awesome
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
aroma
taste
is
bitter
citrusy
hops
light
but
not
too
light
with
good
carbonation
at
5
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
a
few
definately
doesnt
taste
like
5
all
in
all
highly
refreshing
very
drinkable
session
beer
in
fact
probably
the
best
session
ipa
ive
ever
had
wish
i
could
get
this
all
summer
long
perhaps
the
perfect
beer
for
those
early
tailgates
when
the
weather
is
still
warm
and
you
need
a
good
beer
that
you
can
drink
for
3
hours
im
so
glad
this
was
included
in
my
trade
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
ng
beers
a
hell
of
a
pale
ale
that
again
i
wish
i
could
get
regularly
pours
a
sparkling
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
hop
dominant
with
a
fresh
fragrant
combination
of
floral
woodsy
and
citrus
characteristics
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
balanced
with
an
earthy
vet
vibrant
hop
profile
being
at
least
somewhat
contrasted
by
some
nice
bready
malt
sweetness
the
fine
soft
carbonation
only
somewhat
breaks
up
the
resinous
texture
but
it
isnt
at
light
as
i
would
prefer
overall
i
acknowledge
that
this
is
a
terrific
example
of
a
hopforward
pale
ale
but
even
though
i
do
enjoy
a
good
pale
ale
i
couldnt
get
too
excited
about
this
one
nothing
fancy
maybe
not
but
delicious
supersolid
and
wellmade
all
the
same
great
pale
from
rileys
in
madison
generous
retained
head
of
threeeighths
of
an
inch
on
golden
yellow
and
leaving
spider
lacing
mild
hop
aroma
incredible
drinkability
i
finished
in
three
gulps
pleasant
citrus
taste
very
sessionable
very
silky
smooth
highly
recommended
o
good
beer
for
me
it
wasnt
anything
to
special
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
though
a
super
refreshing
beer
first
noticed
the
amazingly
clear
appearance
as
i
poured
this
not
much
head
on
the
pour
very
strong
citrus
aroma
with
slight
grassy
tones
to
follow
up
the
citrus
hops
werent
too
strong
on
the
backend
leaving
a
clean
simple
aftertaste
very
drinkable
ogood
not
overpowering
hops
to
turn
of
a
non
hop
fan
very
crisp
lightmedium
body
with
medium
carbonation
all
in
all
very
refreshing
and
an
extremely
sessionable
pale
i
think
my
ratings
may
seem
high
these
days
and
i
have
about
20
more
to
put
in
from
my
dc
beer
week
trip
maybe
im
not
a
diverse
as
i
thought
but
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
nice
well
made
pale
ale
not
ipa
id
recommend
it
overall
i
can
see
myself
fridgeing
a
couple
six
packs
of
this
beer
on
a
consistent
basis
when
i
want
some
refreshing
and
flavorful
and
not
wanting
to
drink
my
normal
seasoning
beer
gumballhead
worth
a
try
my
favorite
ng
yearly
12ozers
when
i
first
had
this
beer
it
reminded
me
a
more
of
an
ipa
in
terms
of
the
hoppy
flavor
but
overtime
moon
man
pale
ale
has
really
grown
on
me
sometimes
pale
ales
can
be
kind
of
hoppy
but
bland
and
uninteresting
overall
thats
not
the
case
at
all
here
moon
man
is
a
really
flavorful
and
solid
example
of
the
style
plus
at
5
0
abv
this
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
easy
drinking
and
balanced
with
a
fabulous
bouquet
new
glarus
fully
achieved
what
they
were
going
after
with
this
beer
this
is
neither
west
coast
nor
east
coast
uniquely
midwestern
and
a
unlike
any
other
pale
ale
that
youve
had
before
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
that
ive
had
and
another
winner
from
ng
easy
to
drink
with
great
flavor
highly
recommend
only
available
in
wi
so
got
from
ummagum
rotation
if
avail
near
me
would
be
in
heavy
rotation
hy
overall
its
another
fine
selection
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
a
nice
little
apa
especially
at
5
new
glarus
continues
to
pump
out
solid
beers
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
as
a
fridge
staple
overall
a
really
solid
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
id
gladly
drink
my
fill
of
moon
man
any
time
o
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
that
is
easy
drinking
the
whole
way
drinkability
pow
this
one
would
take
alice
straight
to
the
moon
without
ralphs
help
this
is
a
truly
excellent
brew
though
not
hoppy
enough
for
those
far
down
the
road
to
hop
tolerance
this
is
just
a
dang
good
example
of
an
apa
it
doesnt
try
to
blow
you
away
but
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
without
much
bitterness
these
are
very
drinkable
especially
at
5
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
with
slight
haze
good
head
retention
and
some
really
nice
lacing
nose
brings
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
with
a
light
bit
of
grain
in
the
background
taste
is
citrus
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
some
slight
grain
in
the
back
but
no
real
malt
character
feel
is
a
bit
light
and
undercarbonated
ive
had
a
better
pale
ale
cheers
o
a
delicious
apa
wow
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
another
one
of
these
great
beer
for
my
vacation
up
here
in
chetek
wisconsin
every
glass
got
better
notes
nice
apa
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
lemon
floral
and
grass
flavors
are
strong
this
results
in
a
nice
crisp
beer
that
is
great
for
summer
well
balanced
and
overall
just
nice
light
body
just
right
for
a
pale
not
a
caramel
bomb
ample
hopping
gave
the
beer
a
very
refreshing
edge
to
it
only
minorly
bitter
much
more
hop
mouthfeel
than
bitterness
slight
lemongrass
edge
to
it
carbonation
spot
on
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
put
down
very
clean
probably
the
best
hoppy
session
not
made
in
ca
not
overly
dry
just
right
for
style
ive
had
this
beer
about
a
million
times
in
bottles
and
on
tap
just
now
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
appearance
is
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
a
little
hoppier
than
a
lot
of
pale
ales
and
a
lot
tastier
than
a
lot
of
pale
ales
citrus
and
pine
grassy
freshness
malty
too
just
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
refreshing
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
the
moon
man
never
lets
me
down
goldencopper
appearance
solid
lasting
head
great
citrusy
hop
nose
dominantly
grapefruit
malt
is
upfront
with
the
hops
lending
a
note
of
crusty
rustic
bread
great
palate
a
really
nice
balance
between
citrusygrapefruit
hop
flavors
and
bready
malt
has
a
slight
floralherbal
quality
toward
the
finish
something
that
reminds
me
of
rosemary
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
fairly
dry
has
a
more
substantial
texture
than
many
pale
ales
but
its
still
supremely
refreshing
a
great
beer
one
of
my
new
favorite
pale
ales
the
cpj
o
until
now
something
this
hoppy
would
not
be
sessionable
very
capable
of
scratching
a
hop
itch
this
is
now
one
of
my
go
to
session
beers
comments
a
great
beer
to
get
people
introduced
to
the
ipa
style
as
it
gives
a
lot
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
palate
without
much
bitterness
at
all
consequently
for
those
hop
heads
that
really
want
to
experience
the
bitter
this
might
not
be
the
brew
for
you
what
makes
this
apa
stand
out
is
the
clearly
pronounced
aromas
and
flavorshop
and
maltthat
balance
with
such
ease
very
few
beers
of
this
style
can
produce
so
much
flavor
with
such
smoothness
do
similar
to
some
of
new
belgiums
seasonal
pale
ales
this
carefullyhopped
blond
ale
drinks
very
easily
but
doesnt
really
try
to
grab
the
attention
of
the
drinker
like
many
of
the
more
sessionable
american
ales
its
fair
complexion
belies
its
pale
ale
heritage
but
it
is
otherwise
very
appealing
in
its
looks
otherwise
it
is
very
stylistically
true
but
never
extreme
d
its
a
midwest
session
pale
ale
the
low
sweetness
and
excellent
feel
combined
with
the
low
alcohol
make
this
a
great
beer
for
drinking
all
day
in
the
sun
small
shortlived
white
head
tops
a
golden
colored
brew
slight
haze
but
mostly
clear
nice
sticky
hop
scent
floral
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
taste
starts
with
a
light
sweet
malt
front
but
is
dominated
by
hops
floral
grapefruit
a
touch
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
pretty
wet
feel
thats
a
handy
little
pa
they
put
together
overall
a
good
session
beer
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
in
one
sitting
no
problem
this
would
be
a
regular
rotation
beer
if
available
in
my
area
overall
any
fan
of
pale
ale
with
some
hop
bite
to
it
would
love
this
beer
thanks
to
my
brother
in
law
who
lives
in
il
for
bringing
a
few
over
o
this
is
basically
my
goto
beer
and
what
i
used
to
try
to
recruit
people
into
the
world
of
hops
super
drinkable
was
very
glad
when
new
glarus
made
this
a
regular
stamp
in
their
lineup
moon
man
is
easily
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
and
although
i
enjoy
a
nice
high
abv
pale
ale
the
lower
abv
of
makes
this
beer
one
where
i
can
knock
back
a
few
in
a
row
without
getting
too
much
of
a
buzz
also
knowing
that
new
glarus
beers
generally
sell
for
78
for
a
six
pack
thsi
beer
is
plenty
affordable
moon
man
pours
a
nice
golden
color
that
is
quite
translucent
a
fingers
worth
of
white
head
sits
patiently
the
aroma
is
citrus
zest
and
a
bit
of
pine
and
buttered
biscuit
the
taste
is
pretty
bitter
and
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
a
pretty
bold
a
sweet
honey
taste
is
balanced
with
the
hop
offerings
a
nice
crisp
feel
with
a
bitter
dry
finish
drinkable
and
very
tasty
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
light
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
a
session
beer
or
to
have
a
meal
refreshing
and
delicious
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
overall
a
great
easy
to
drink
flavorful
pale
ale
this
pours
golden
with
active
bubbles
and
nice
foamy
head
the
smell
is
very
potent
bitter
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
most
notably
fresh
hoppy
and
bitter
this
almost
gives
you
a
sour
candy
sensation
the
body
is
pretty
light
but
the
crisp
bite
of
this
brew
lingers
and
just
adds
to
the
refreshment
that
it
provides
it
has
a
strong
effervescent
grapefruit
flavor
this
is
the
cold
shower
of
beers
a
welcome
change
to
the
usual
oversyrup
douchy
ipas
that
i
usually
drink
seriously
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
fresh
hop
character
that
i
have
been
craving
this
hits
the
spot
o
very
drinkable
especially
for
this
time
of
year
very
session
friendly
for
the
warmer
months
that
lie
ahead
just
a
very
well
put
together
beer
from
new
glarus
overall
this
is
a
winner
i
love
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
still
heavyhanded
with
hops
its
alot
like
gumballhead
in
that
respect
but
more
wellrounded
and
cleaner
im
going
to
trade
for
some
more
of
this
soon
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
chicago
distributorship
can
go
f
themselves
when
you
have
friends
that
travel
to
wisconsin
and
are
willing
to
bring
new
glarus
beers
back
it
quite
a
blessing
the
latest
contraband
bought
into
chicago
was
moon
man
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
gem
with
white
head
the
smell
is
a
smooth
lemonycitrus
which
appeals
quote
nicely
the
taste
is
dominated
more
by
a
sublte
pine
than
citrus
as
one
might
suspect
from
the
aroma
the
beer
is
very
easy
on
the
pallete
and
could
session
all
night
long
o
a
highly
quaffable
beer
new
glarus
moon
man
manages
to
eek
out
an
aboveaverage
grade
for
a
style
that
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
ways
to
be
particularly
good
or
bad
very
clean
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
nice
beer
overall
o
i
would
definitely
buy
a
6
this
one
very
pleasant
surprise
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
its
ease
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
feeling
out
the
craft
beer
scene
good
starter
brew
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
refreshing
overall
very
nice
session
beer
easy
to
drink
solid
example
of
pale
ale
well
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
with
no
off
flavors
seems
to
be
best
when
its
cold
nice
sessionable
pale
ale
d
super
drinkable
the
flavors
here
are
nice
and
balanced
and
far
from
empty
but
the
whole
thing
feels
crisp
and
super
refreshing
the
finish
is
really
nice
overall
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
i
really
enjoy
it
a
nice
light
pale
ale
with
good
citrus
hop
flavor
that
doesnt
overpower
a
very
good
session
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
full
hop
flavored
beer
with
nice
complexity
and
very
little
bitterness
making
it
very
drinkable
the
fizz
just
got
in
the
way
of
the
hops
at
times
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
pale
ale
sessionable
crisp
tasty
refreshing
the
list
goes
on
this
beer
does
it
all
without
doing
too
much
i
wish
that
they
sold
this
down
in
tx
because
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
aint
no
question
o
wow
not
sure
why
i
took
so
long
to
rate
this
an
amazingly
refreshing
apa
at
the
pricepoint
it
is
my
go
to
apa
taste
as
good
a
an
english
pa
but
with
some
fruity
hoppiness
without
going
overboard
ill
take
this
over
a
daisy
cutter
or
sn
any
day
overall
this
is
a
nice
sessin
beer
with
great
balance
i
will
be
enjoying
on
really
hot
days
a
great
introductory
beer
for
someone
curious
about
hoppy
beers
without
numbing
their
palate
with
hop
bitterness
o
new
glarus
is
an
exceptional
brewery
and
this
is
an
exceptional
pale
ale
overall
a
very
mild
ale
quite
sweet
and
lemony
reminds
me
of
lemon
drop
candy
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
hops
are
mild
but
very
welcome
as
it
brings
some
balance
solid
drinking
session
ale
d
ther
eis
no
date
code
that
i
can
find
on
this
bottle
but
i
imagine
this
has
to
be
extremely
fresh
hops
are
intense
and
citrusy
this
is
great
i
cant
believe
this
is
only
a
5
0
apa
im
a
hardcore
believer
in
snpa
as
the
benchmark
for
this
style
but
i
think
this
is
outstanding
perhaps
more
of
an
american
ipa
in
flavor
but
strength
is
lacking
wow
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
size
head
good
laceing
the
smell
weas
of
that
of
a
grapefruit
and
there
was
a
nice
hoppy
order
the
taste
was
a
bit
weaker
had
the
grapefurit
and
bitterness
like
most
apas
but
had
a
very
wet
flavor
and
pretty
weak
could
have
used
a
much
stronger
taste
it
was
a
bit
watered
down
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
weak
flavor
d
great
drinkability
lightly
hopped
great
balance
of
malt
nice
and
crisp
pours
a
crisp
clear
orange
with
about
a
finger
of
a
white
frothy
head
slowly
dissipating
lots
of
great
floral
hops
in
the
nose
a
lighter
hop
taste
than
i
would
expect
but
surprisingly
deep
and
balanced
some
light
citrus
starts
out
as
it
builds
into
a
nice
sweetness
that
fades
into
hop
bitterness
i
like
this
a
lot
better
then
the
last
2
i
tried
from
new
glarus
this
and
fat
squirel
so
far
are
the
2
i
liked
best
out
of
the
5
i
have
tried
very
drinkable
will
be
purchasing
again
o
loved
the
look
especially
the
head
and
nice
smell
i
had
hoped
for
a
little
more
pop
from
the
hops
but
overall
it
was
very
drinkable
and
not
unexpected
from
this
great
new
glarus
representation
drinkability
now
if
you
were
ever
in
need
of
a
session
beer
this
would
be
a
serious
contender
at
just
5
00
abv
this
one
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
drinking
plenty
of
these
in
any
one
instance
especially
on
a
hot
day
andor
a
cook
out
well
done
new
glarus
your
moon
man
was
a
shot
in
the
right
direction
d
eminently
drinkable
an
amazing
session
pale
id
love
another
and
a
whole
6pack
got
as
a
gift
in
a
sampler
thanks
to
john
hanlon
update
i
bought
6
when
i
was
in
wi
last
and
they
were
fabulous
will
buy
again
d
this
brew
is
phenomenal
no
doubt
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
pale
ale
very
little
room
for
improvement
wow
enjoy
great
body
and
mouthfeel
medium
body
excellent
carbonation
and
nice
medium
length
hoppy
finish
superb
drinkability
d
this
pale
ale
was
pretty
good
i
think
it
was
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
in
the
flavor
i
was
just
put
off
by
the
fake
fruit
flavors
i
am
happy
i
was
able
to
taste
some
new
glarus
beers
finally
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
as
the
light
bodied
beer
has
nice
carbonation
and
comes
off
as
crisp
and
light
the
bitter
peak
is
well
covered
by
the
malt
and
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
hint
of
bitterness
remains
through
a
clean
finish
the
beer
could
have
just
a
touch
more
body
but
the
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
light
feel
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
stouts
and
hop
bombs
ive
been
enjoying
this
winter
ive
heard
of
lawnmower
beers
but
this
was
my
snowblower
beer
today
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
one
of
the
most
refreshing
pale
ales
i
have
encountered
love
the
attenuated
malt
character
and
the
citrusy
hops
not
over
the
top
not
a
challenge
just
great
to
drink
moon
man
is
a
good
flavorful
beer
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
so
im
not
sure
of
the
color
went
down
very
easily
a
nice
pale
ale
not
overpowering
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
a
few
more
of
these
d
twelve
ounces
down
the
hatch
no
problem
if
this
was
available
in
my
corner
of
the
world
it
would
always
see
rotation
in
my
fridge
love
the
theme
behind
this
beer
its
not
about
being
from
one
coast
or
the
other
just
about
being
a
quality
beer
prime
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
its
incredibly
drinkable
d
glad
i
gave
this
another
chance
refreshing
session
beer
not
a
home
run
but
a
standup
double
sorry
for
the
baseball
reference
and
im
not
even
much
of
a
fan
excellent
gateway
beer
for
you
timid
friends
the
ladies
may
be
intrigued
by
the
pleasant
citrus
aroma
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
session
beer
by
definition
but
certainly
one
you
could
make
a
long
night
out
of
d
pretty
high
being
only
5
i
could
have
quite
a
few
too
many
of
these
if
it
werent
for
the
dryness
as
i
think
it
would
get
to
me
over
time
still
a
very
nice
apa
im
not
usually
a
pale
ale
guy
and
i
got
one
bottle
of
this
as
part
of
a
christmas
present
i
could
see
myself
buying
more
good
stuff
12
ounce
bottle
sample
slightly
murky
light
tangerine
in
colour
with
minimal
head
some
sticky
lacing
nose
floral
hops
taste
moderate
hopping
tropical
fruit
lemon
and
floral
light
biscuit
malts
in
the
background
spritzy
carbonation
and
nice
drinkability
a
good
quaffer
drinkability
quite
so
a
very
good
beer
should
have
bought
a
couple
of
these
d
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
hop
kick
to
this
one
incredibly
drinkable
and
clean
one
of
the
most
session
able
beers
i
have
ever
had
d
scarily
drinkable
my
new
favorite
apa
very
well
done
deb
dan
dthis
is
a
decent
apa
but
there
are
certainly
better
examples
out
there
i
did
not
finish
this
6pack
as
quickly
as
i
expected
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
slight
head
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
yellowgold
in
color
a
tiny
bit
hazy
smell
is
bright
and
full
of
citrus
the
taste
is
full
of
grapefruit
the
hops
shows
up
nicely
but
isnt
too
powerful
light
bitterness
clean
and
dry
in
the
finish
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
could
spend
all
evening
with
a
very
nice
pale
ale
d
3
54
when
this
came
out
it
was
the
only
beer
i
regularly
felt
the
desire
to
drink
3
of
in
a
sitting
easygoing
teasing
with
its
aromatics
a
synch
to
down
them
much
faster
than
intended
in
a
way
its
very
dumbed
down
but
when
you
might
be
getting
in
the
mood
for
the
sort
of
charms
it
offers
its
possibly
worth
having
around
when
you
something
with
any
sort
of
substance
going
on
stay
far
away
i
dunno
the
more
times
i
have
moon
man
the
more
it
fees
and
tastes
like
a
fraud
d
its
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
how
one
could
want
more
than
one
of
these
a
very
good
easy
drinker
overall
a
lighter
bodied
beer
really
spritzy
and
something
that
would
be
a
good
acomidation
for
the
summer
months
as
well
as
now
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
color
is
golden
amber
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
settles
quickly
with
no
lacing
and
a
small
collar
an
active
carbonation
in
the
glass
smell
is
great
incredibly
hoppy
this
must
be
very
fresh
pineapple
malt
slightly
floral
a
bit
of
pine
taste
is
smooth
and
balanced
grassy
hops
slightly
citrus
lots
of
tropical
fruit
and
pineapple
malt
follows
to
keep
things
even
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
medium
fizzy
carbonation
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
overall
drinkability
is
great
an
excellent
pale
ale
this
would
be
a
go
to
beer
during
the
summer
if
it
was
available
british
american
perhaps
not
certain
kicks
ass
whatever
the
hell
it
is
very
good
pale
ale
maybe
a
little
overcarbonated
but
still
very
sessionable
d
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
mind
blowing
good
for
the
style
but
there
are
others
id
drink
before
this
outside
of
wisconsin
this
beer
is
not
easily
available
so
i
hope
that
i
got
a
good
example
of
this
beer
to
try
absolutely
drinkable
i
could
stick
with
this
all
night
and
be
satisfied
pours
a
clear
golden
with
2
fingers
of
white
head
smells
are
citrus
some
pine
hops
and
sweet
malt
tastes
are
sweet
malt
right
at
the
front
followed
by
some
citrus
and
pine
with
a
nice
smooth
semibitter
finish
and
leaves
a
nice
citrusy
aftertaste
i
say
semibitter
because
its
so
perfectly
balanced
that
the
bitterness
fades
quickly
mouthfeel
is
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
really
high
very
good
beer
i
totally
understand
how
ng
outsells
rogue
even
though
ng
is
only
in
wi
awesome
taste
is
nice
but
not
as
hopped
or
citrus
as
i
am
used
to
in
general
a
hoppiness
and
citrus
blend
that
leans
a
little
sweet
lemon
and
orange
really
a
nice
fresh
beer
but
over
all
is
a
little
middle
of
the
road
nice
carbonation
and
drinkability
a
rather
laid
back
example
but
good
dpleasantly
drinkable
with
an
overall
easy
body
and
a
smooth
feel
sessionable
to
be
certain
as
is
indicated
on
the
label
d
great
drinkability
and
great
to
grab
for
in
the
midst
of
all
the
big
beers
out
there
im
happy
to
have
this
one
while
i
sit
back
and
relax
this
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
in
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
citrus
and
tall
grass
the
taste
is
massive
clean
refreshing
hops
with
citrus
cantaloupe
and
mango
this
is
a
delicious
hoppy
ale
one
of
the
most
interesting
hop
flavor
profiles
i
have
tried
good
balance
with
a
lean
toward
hops
pretty
much
an
ipa
good
mix
of
citrus
and
malt
extremely
balanced
man
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
impressive
toasted
malt
up
front
quickly
gives
way
to
crisp
hop
bitterness
orange
zestcitrus
hop
flavors
turn
to
grapefruit
with
accents
of
pine
grainy
malt
turns
to
more
of
a
light
biscuit
and
mildly
sweet
caramel
notes
drying
hop
bitterness
takes
over
the
finish
mineral
water
and
lingering
citrus
rind
moderate
body
with
a
somewhat
lively
feel
a
nice
refreshing
pleasantly
balanced
apa
very
sessionable
d
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
it
is
not
filling
overly
alcoholic
palatenumbing
or
overly
complex
to
fatigue
the
senses
through
a
6pack
or
more
really
well
balanced
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
d
although
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
or
have
any
distinguishing
characteristics
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
as
its
out
of
my
market
and
i
can
drink
local
beers
that
are
comparable
another
entry
in
the
preinterview
extravaganza
it
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
tangerine
melon
and
a
light
caramel
the
taste
runs
along
a
similar
path
with
some
mandarin
oranges
and
hop
spices
thrown
into
the
mix
as
well
the
body
is
light
drifting
toward
the
heavy
side
thereof
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
prickly
finish
overall
a
solid
pale
but
one
that
threatens
to
verge
on
the
overlyordinary
thankfully
without
actually
following
through
still
highly
drinkable
though
lighter
medium
body
some
sticky
dry
warmth
easy
drinking
but
still
completely
amazing
flavor
profile
an
incredibly
solid
beer
d
overall
a
nice
session
type
beer
or
a
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
seafood
andor
a
salad
o
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
although
its
not
something
id
necessarily
trade
for
very
pleasant
but
not
extraordinary
d
very
high
in
terms
of
flavors
and
the
awesome
sessionlike
5
abv
bottle
poured
into
my
lakefront
brewery
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
bubbled
white
head
the
aroma
of
hops
is
really
apparent
not
overly
piney
or
citrus
but
a
nice
balance
slightly
leaning
toward
citrus
and
lemon
mediumlight
mouthfeel
nice
balance
between
sweet
my
and
hop
bitterness
nice
lace
on
the
glass
if
i
was
lookin
for
a
really
hoppy
apa
then
i
would
grab
something
different
but
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
at
5
too
this
is
a
really
nice
sessionable
beer
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
that
thins
the
feel
out
slightly
to
a
lighter
body
the
lead
off
is
a
mild
sweetness
hop
flavors
and
some
bitterness
at
the
back
with
a
nice
midpalate
presence
its
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
them
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
solid
head
smells
very
citrusy
for
just
a
pale
ale
the
hops
really
come
through
taste
is
fairly
balanced
but
there
is
a
solid
hop
flavor
that
is
missing
in
many
pales
it
doesnt
get
weighed
down
by
the
malt
either
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
each
very
light
body
with
some
solid
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
choice
from
the
always
excellent
new
glarus
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
really
like
how
drinkable
and
light
it
is
but
i
could
wish
for
some
more
fruitladen
hop
character
here
i
really
like
the
aroma
of
this
brew
if
the
taste
had
followed
suit
it
would
have
been
heaven
drinkability
a
great
beer
overall
seems
to
be
exactly
the
right
amount
of
flavors
and
lack
of
poor
ones
to
be
considered
the
epitome
of
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
d
im
beginning
to
become
a
new
glarus
fan
and
have
yet
to
sample
a
bad
beer
by
them
dont
buy
the
hype
that
this
is
an
apa
it
may
have
been
made
like
an
apa
but
it
sure
did
not
taste
like
one
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
weissvery
fruity
with
strong
hints
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
im
not
in
to
fruity
beers
but
as
fruity
beers
go
this
was
tolerable
that
said
it
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
and
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
with
slight
haze
good
head
retention
and
some
really
nice
lacing
nose
brings
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
with
a
light
bit
of
grain
in
the
background
taste
is
citrus
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
some
slight
grain
in
the
back
but
no
real
malt
character
feel
is
a
bit
light
and
undercarbonated
tasty
but
i
preferred
hop
hearty
and
there
are
certainly
better
apas
out
there
an
excellent
pale
ale
i
can
drink
this
in
gulps
and
keep
coming
back
for
more
highly
recommended
on
the
whole
im
more
of
a
bigger
beer
guy
but
do
enjoy
the
lower
abv
ones
when
they
are
tasty
this
one
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
either
pale
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
all
hops
notes
of
citrus
pine
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
malt
comes
out
a
little
in
the
flavor
but
not
much
plenty
of
hop
flavor
that
starts
off
with
citrus
but
finishes
more
herbal
and
grassy
this
is
a
dry
beer
that
could
of
used
a
little
sweetness
not
that
it
is
overly
bitter
but
it
is
nice
to
have
something
for
the
hops
to
play
off
of
i
expected
a
little
bit
of
balance
from
this
brewer
lighter
body
with
nice
carbonation
fits
the
flavor
well
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
the
drinker
happy
sessionable
and
a
great
value
i
think
the
bottles
description
of
the
hops
as
bright
is
spot
on
and
the
beer
is
a
nice
example
of
packing
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
pale
ale
without
overhopping
and
treading
into
the
ipa
category
not
my
favorite
apa
out
there
but
tasty
and
a
refreshingly
unique
take
on
the
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
at
5
i
would
not
mind
having
a
few
of
these
if
only
they
distributed
to
mn
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
last
night
and
kept
thinking
about
it
throughout
the
day
maybe
my
freudian
libidos
taking
a
vacation
i
couldnt
help
but
take
a
long
lunch
and
share
my
observations
the
body
is
firm
slightly
slick
not
filling
at
all
great
flavors
of
lemon
zest
hops
crackers
and
a
light
grassy
note
this
is
like
a
hoppy
lager
for
sure
light
crisp
refreshing
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
in
awhile
is
different
enough
from
the
standard
that
i
could
have
this
most
anytime
wish
i
had
it
locally
recommend
d
very
drinkable
the
thin
feeling
adds
to
the
refreshing
aspect
of
this
and
at
5
3
or
4
of
these
would
not
be
an
issue
d
a
very
simple
but
pleasant
little
apa
i
could
drink
a
tone
of
these
moon
man
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
in
your
face
grapefruity
citrusy
hops
sweet
pale
malt
hovers
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
light
and
slightly
malty
with
plenty
of
hops
that
have
a
lemony
character
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
but
the
bitter
doesnt
linger
this
is
a
great
hoppy
session
type
beer
i
would
drink
it
regularly
if
it
was
local
drank
this
one
super
quick
dammit
pours
with
some
sediment
in
the
glass
the
aroma
packs
a
little
bit
of
everything
from
florals
to
pine
to
fruity
yeast
juicy
citrusy
hops
very
tasty
and
balanced
on
my
tongue
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
could
see
this
being
my
new
sierra
pale
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
yummy
drinkability
i
was
disappointed
i
finished
the
beer
but
will
wait
before
having
another
had
this
again
fresh
from
the
tasting
room
on
lots
of
fresh
onion
and
earthy
hops
explode
on
this
much
holier
than
i
remembered
very
light
and
sessionable
which
is
perfect
for
a
midday
beer
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
bringing
this
one
out
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
loose
halfinch
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
skim
and
a
broken
band
around
the
edges
great
nose
peaches
and
wheat
simple
but
very
satisfying
taste
follows
nose
but
much
more
muted
and
the
peaches
are
expressed
more
as
a
citric
juice
quality
behind
the
wheat
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
pleasant
background
carbonation
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
a
very
different
apa
than
anything
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
thus
far
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
very
distinctive
character
for
the
style
overall
an
amazing
choice
that
i
was
so
happy
that
i
made
i
was
just
immensly
impressed
with
this
beer
d
so
easy
to
get
down
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
good
drink
this
all
day
a
very
nice
apa
bright
feeling
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
apa
that
is
perfect
for
spring
and
summer
new
glarus
hits
another
seasonal
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
d
a
good
beer
to
remind
you
that
a
beer
can
showcase
hops
without
smacking
you
in
the
face
another
well
done
offering
from
new
glarus
overall
a
good
session
beer
that
also
would
do
well
as
a
lawnmower
its
balanced
and
not
overpowering
a
delicious
beer
all
around
i
really
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
this
as
its
only
sold
in
wi
d
a
beer
that
is
enjoyed
best
in
the
sun
a
good
session
brew
but
flavors
are
lacking
in
presence
d
as
a
fan
of
pales
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
very
drinkable
and
begs
for
a
second
d
this
is
one
hell
of
a
good
pale
ale
wish
it
were
local
as
it
definitely
would
be
a
standard
for
me
recommended
flavor
is
strong
sour
citrus
a
very
pilsener
like
malt
presence
then
a
slightly
astringent
bitterness
not
a
really
strong
lasting
bitterness
but
it
has
some
astringency
about
it
that
i
didnt
find
so
pleasant
i
like
everything
else
about
this
beer
except
that
ending
flavor
it
finishes
very
clean
after
the
astringency
fades
making
it
quite
drinkable
strong
flavors
clean
finish
leaving
you
ready
for
more
carbonation
was
very
full
upping
the
mouthfeel
for
this
otherwise
light
beer
d
fantastic
you
just
cant
have
one
of
these
i
grabbed
2
sixers
of
this
when
i
was
in
wi
a
few
weeks
ago
and
ive
already
blown
through
them
my
2nd
favorite
american
pale
ale
just
behind
three
floyds
alpha
king
really
nice
apa
from
new
glarus
i
really
enjoy
the
aggressive
hoppiness
and
the
refreshing
clean
flavor
well
worth
seeking
out
a
few
bottles
malts
make
their
presence
felt
in
the
flavor
with
an
earthy
roasted
barley
hint
to
the
paleness
grainy
and
slightly
doughy
but
thankfully
the
hops
kick
in
midswallow
to
secure
moon
mans
footing
in
the
style
a
bit
of
pine
to
the
bitterness
but
the
big
tropical
fruits
from
the
aroma
have
all
but
disappeared
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
with
a
refreshing
quality
to
the
crispness
that
makes
this
beer
go
down
too
easily
all
in
all
a
highly
serviceable
pale
ale
from
new
glarus
but
these
guys
make
better
imo
this
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
thick
sticky
lacing
this
is
what
an
apa
should
look
like
the
aroma
is
of
pine
resin
grapefruit
and
herbs
this
is
a
very
hoppy
smelling
beer
with
no
real
malt
comping
through
it
works
though
in
the
the
hop
profile
is
quite
interesting
the
taste
is
very
balanced
in
fact
it
is
slightly
on
the
malty
side
with
some
nice
hop
dryness
in
the
finish
i
really
like
how
this
beer
smells
hoppy
but
tastes
mildly
malty
both
play
well
of
each
other
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
i
have
had
and
at
5
it
is
extremely
sessionable
kudos
to
new
glarus
dthis
is
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
it
has
a
good
hop
presence
with
enough
malt
to
balance
very
good
feel
just
lacking
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
nice
balance
with
the
bitterness
light
but
still
present
very
good
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
smoother
and
easier
drinking
than
some
of
the
overhopped
takes
on
the
style
these
days
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
new
glarus
does
not
disappoint
d
very
nice
a
pretty
damn
good
apa
rivals
some
of
my
favorites
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
well
crafted
apa
and
fits
the
style
well
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
really
pulls
me
back
to
the
glass
it
would
be
nice
to
see
something
more
from
the
aroma
or
flavor
but
this
is
still
a
good
brew
it
seems
like
most
of
the
standard
beers
from
new
glarus
are
good
but
not
great
still
an
enjoyable
drink
though
the
mouth
is
slightly
oily
and
sticky
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
could
work
as
a
session
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
better
yet
cask
good
solid
basic
drink
nothing
to
shout
about
and
nothing
to
complain
about
i
bet
it
would
be
nice
on
tap
d
i
was
expecting
a
hop
bomb
with
this
one
but
then
i
remembered
this
is
new
glarus
and
they
not
only
do
everything
great
but
they
do
it
to
style
what
i
got
here
was
a
wonderfully
fantastic
pale
ale
this
isnt
a
lower
alcohol
ipa
it
has
wonderful
balance
and
sort
of
reminds
me
why
new
glarus
is
so
amazing
not
ng
best
effort
clear
golden
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
nice
piney
hops
in
thenose
some
citrus
in
there
maybe
orange
not
much
sweetness
taste
is
all
piney
hops
some
different
flavors
of
bitter
citrus
rind
particularly
orange
and
maybe
some
grapefruit
bitterness
is
there
but
not
overpowering
medium
body
average
carbonation
dry
finish
a
very
flavorful
apa
that
rivals
many
ipas
in
flavor
and
bitterness
but
with
the
added
benefit
of
being
lower
in
alcohol
good
beer
plus
points
on
the
drinkability
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
low
abv
a
great
sessionable
beer
drinkability
is
good
nicely
balanced
really
liked
the
aroma
but
then
it
came
down
a
notch
in
the
flavour
reviewed
on
07232010
062121
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
pale
ale
definitely
has
some
neat
hop
character
more
ipaish
than
pale
ale
thanks
russ
d
another
winner
for
new
glarus
d
a
decent
apa
mostly
citrus
hops
here
would
try
again
i
could
do
with
this
in
a
pinch
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
cant
report
on
the
color
as
this
was
poured
into
a
red
plastic
picnic
cup
piney
hops
dominate
the
smell
and
maybe
a
trace
of
bready
malt
taste
has
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
quality
hops
are
evident
but
they
dont
club
you
on
the
head
like
many
of
todays
popular
superhoppy
brews
nicely
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
picked
up
a
single
its
a
good
pale
ale
that
is
flavorful
enough
while
still
being
easy
to
drink
another
good
one
from
new
glarus
folks
this
is
about
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
a
tasty
thirst
quencher
this
is
a
drinkable
apa
quite
sessionable
i
think
its
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
as
its
not
extreme
in
any
way
for
the
more
experience
beer
drinker
however
it
may
be
a
bit
simple
and
even
watery
what
can
i
say
new
glarus
has
been
my
go
too
brewery
for
the
last
several
years
living
in
chicago
i
only
get
out
there
twice
a
year
and
seeing
as
they
will
not
distribute
to
chicago
or
anywhere
besides
wisconsin
i
may
hype
it
up
in
y
head
throughout
the
seasons
however
this
particular
brew
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
green
flash
and
gumballhead
without
being
too
heavv
or
too
sweet
another
quality
is
that
it
is
also
similar
to
the
lagunitas
ipa
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
created
imo
without
the
superfruitiness
that
makes
the
lipa
tiresome
after
6
months
of
loyal
sessioning
i
know
5s
are
extra
special
but
so
is
this
brew
jason
todd
get
on
this
one
this
is
truly
one
beer
that
belongs
to
no
coasts
yet
all
coasts
can
appreciate
this
is
a
pretty
well
put
together
pale
ale
and
a
hoppy
one
i
might
add
smell
is
piney
and
rich
with
grassy
and
toasty
malt
notes
to
go
along
with
the
hoppiness
taste
is
very
hop
forward
and
bitter
with
undertones
of
malt
and
fruit
mouthfeel
is
substantial
and
full
but
a
little
transient
drink
oh
yeah
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
think
ill
have
another
i
had
this
beer
ontap
at
the
new
glarus
brewery
i
liked
this
beer
although
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
pale
ale
that
ive
had
it
is
a
nice
slightly
darker
shade
of
gold
nice
head
on
this
beer
strong
aroma
some
of
my
party
was
turned
off
by
the
smell
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
taste
is
comparable
to
other
pale
ales
ive
had
a
very
slight
bitterness
moon
man
seemed
to
get
better
as
i
kept
drinking
it
though
so
if
you
dont
like
it
at
first
give
it
a
chance
new
glarus
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
drinkability
very
easy
drinker
if
this
was
regularly
available
id
definitely
buy
a
lot
of
this
that
having
been
said
and
not
to
take
anything
away
from
moon
man
an
apa
i
sincerely
hope
that
new
glarus
brings
a
true
ipa
to
the
scene
in
the
near
future
hop
hearty
was
fine
but
not
up
to
the
brewerys
standards
44
5545
d
this
is
not
a
hop
bomb
by
any
means
and
i
dont
believe
ng
intended
it
to
be
one
this
is
a
flavorful
summer
brew
that
you
could
drink
all
day
long
on
the
boat
at
the
beach
at
a
barbeque
it
tastes
much
bigger
than
it
actually
is
though
a
very
good
and
very
sessionable
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
new
glarus
knows
how
to
make
a
drinkable
beer
this
one
has
a
bit
more
going
on
than
most
new
glarus
brews
yet
another
glorious
great
lakes
apa
light
bodied
with
a
a
lot
of
effervescent
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
will
seek
it
out
again
poured
into
a
drinking
glass
was
a
very
hazy
straw
yellow
with
fairly
active
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white
two
finger
head
i
was
actually
a
bit
surprised
at
how
light
was
the
color
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
extremely
floral
not
piny
like
most
pale
ales
almost
like
a
bouquet
of
wildflowers
many
differnt
light
flowery
aromas
mixed
together
nice
initial
taste
was
corn
and
grain
followed
by
grass
and
a
light
hoppiness
not
bitter
or
resiny
but
very
delicate
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
but
it
was
done
exceptionally
well
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
slightly
sticky
finish
dthis
is
a
really
easy
drinking
solid
brew
from
new
glarus
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
stone
levitation
with
the
low
alcohol
level
and
the
taste
profile
overall
a
terrific
pale
ale
and
one
that
i
would
drink
nonstop
if
i
could
get
it
where
i
live
m
creamy
feel
and
extremely
easy
drinking
an
excellent
example
of
an
apa
this
could
be
an
everyday
beer
if
available
here
thanks
to
don
h
for
having
the
willpower
to
get
this
bottle
all
the
way
from
wisconsin
to
pa
well
made
but
flavor
is
not
quite
to
our
liking
something
slightly
off
it
seems
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
good
lacing
throughout
aroma
is
pale
malts
bread
grass
and
a
bunch
of
hops
citrus
earthy
grass
flavor
is
caramel
malts
lemon
zest
citrus
and
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
fair
amount
of
carbonation
a
little
chalky
bitter
at
the
end
great
beer
well
balanced
drinkable
i
want
another
one
a
big
step
up
from
spotted
cow
for
a
summer
sipper
as
its
complexity
is
beneficially
broader
and
tastier
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
high
but
besides
that
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
screams
summer
drinker
and
really
shows
how
a
hop
forward
beer
can
come
in
at
5
pours
a
beautiful
clearish
golden
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
white
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
some
mildly
fruity
hoppy
qualities
flavor
matches
in
large
part
but
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
tasty
brew
and
something
i
could
drink
all
day
already
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
d
the
bottle
notes
this
is
a
session
beer
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
beer
is
its
light
its
simple
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
its
nothing
special
if
this
one
were
to
have
been
brewed
by
someone
other
than
ng
people
would
be
shitting
all
over
it
drinkability
is
likewise
spectacular
perfect
summer
beer
for
sitting
on
the
porch
and
soaking
in
the
sun
ive
said
it
before
i
would
give
up
34
of
the
beer
available
in
tn
to
get
new
glarus
because
its
just
that
good
overall
this
is
a
nicely
done
american
pale
ale
about
up
to
what
id
expect
from
new
glarus
drinkable
feels
a
bit
thin
though
the
flavors
carry
it
a
long
way
easy
to
session
without
thinking
about
it
much
recommended
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
thats
worth
seeking
out
a
respectable
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
but
id
drink
this
again
pours
a
nice
deep
blonde
color
with
a
good
head
and
good
lace
the
aroma
is
nice
sticky
pine
sap
and
some
citrus
basically
a
bunch
of
fresh
fruity
hops
the
flavor
follows
with
that
tropical
fruit
hoppiness
featuring
the
mango
and
the
citrus
and
the
like
the
bitterness
is
well
controlled
but
certainly
noticeable
thankfully
this
is
a
very
simple
but
masterfully
well
done
apa
d
high
im
not
a
hophead
and
this
is
at
about
the
extent
of
my
comfort
level
nice
pours
a
deep
golden
not
quite
amber
color
nice
white
head
and
generous
lacing
smell
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
lots
of
grapefruit
and
pine
notes
bready
toasted
biscuits
are
in
the
back
ground
too
great
tasting
beer
this
is
what
you
want
from
a
pale
ale
nice
substantial
malty
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
perfectly
balanced
with
a
huge
dose
of
spicy
herbal
hop
bitterness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
level
of
hoppiness
in
this
beer
crisp
and
bitter
but
still
very
well
balanced
you
dont
have
to
be
a
raging
hophead
to
enjoy
this
insanely
drinkable
this
is
the
best
product
ive
had
from
new
glarus
i
will
be
drinking
plenty
of
moon
man
in
the
future
this
beer
is
great
easily
one
of
my
favorite
ngs
a
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
despite
organic
revolution
and
hop
hearty
which
didnt
float
my
boat
it
seems
that
ng
can
do
hops
a
unique
and
flavorful
apa
my
new
fave
the
sixpack
just
disappeared
drinkability
no
mistaking
what
this
beer
is
a
lightly
hoppy
beautifully
drinkable
pale
ale
i
dont
like
malt
getting
in
the
way
of
my
hoppy
goodness
and
moon
man
fits
that
bill
perfectly
i
will
be
grabbing
a
sixer
of
this
my
next
trip
to
wisconsin
great
beer
drinkability
im
not
a
hophead
so
i
have
no
problem
with
a
pale
ale
that
takes
a
moderate
approach
to
hopping
a
good
tasting
beer
from
a
company
with
a
fine
track
record
pours

nice

the
taste
is

some

good
dose
of

thrown
it
medium

very
drinkable
this
would
pass
as
an
ipa
for
some
love
the
ng
brews
edit
now
that
i
have
had
most
of
the
bottle
i
must
say
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
abrasive
ale
if
you
live
in
the
midwest
you
need
to
find
some
new
glarus
theyre
not
all
great
but
none
are
bad
and
some
are
rad

overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer

quite
drinkable
id
recommend
it
for
drinking
a
6er
in
a
night
picked
up
a
6
pack
at
woodmans
market
in

poured
into
a

give
a
nice

eventually
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
atop
the
beer
very
lemon
smell
with
some
grapefruit
and
grassy
notes
tastes
fairly
balanced
with
malts
and
hops
for
about
12
second
and
then
a
hop
bomb
is
dropped
on
your
tongue
lots
of
citrus
and
some
grassypiney
flavors
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
excellent
hop
profile
on
this
apa
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
an

and
an
pale

i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
if
only
i
lived
in
wisconsin
golden

with
light
carbonation
speckled
throughout
the

the

sporadic
patches

really
nice
zesty
fresh

lemon

cheezdawg
d
a
fantastically
refreshing

nothing
more
i
need
to
say
about
that
d
very
drinkable
and
may
well
become
my
session
beer
of
choice
this
summer
well
balanced
and
hoppy
without
being
bitter
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
and
southern
stars
pine
belt
pale
ale
were
my
top
2
pas
until
today
now
they
found
a
new
brew
to
fun
in
their
wolfpack
moon
man
welcome
poured
into
a
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
clear
yelloworange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
the
brew
was
nice
an
full
of
citrus
and
hops
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
heavy
on
the
clove
and
citrus
and
not
as
much
hops
as
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
but
the
carbonation
was
nice
this
was
a
decent
pale
ale
but
not
the
best
worth
a
try
for
sure
this
is
a
crisp
refreshing
tasty
simple
summertime
beer
im
done
analyzing
will
continue
drinking
carry
on
it
has
that
taste
and
texture
of
a
beer
that
you
look
for
just
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
summer
day
then
lay
in
the
hammock
with
a
six
pack
on
ice
at
your
side
aside
from
some
of
the
unplugged
offerings
this
has
to
be
the
my
favorite
ng
beer
ive
had
to
date
this
has
to
be
the
quintessential
session
beer
for
me
the
nose
packed
with
fresh
floral
hop
aroma
with
just
enough
citrus
this
beer
has
the
nose
and
hop
presence
of
an
ipa
but
still
manages
to
drink
like
a
very
well
balanced
apa
good
carbonation
with
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
i
am
glad
its
only
5abv
cause
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
especially
on
some
of
those
long
summer
days
believe
i
have
found
my
new
summer
session
beer
easy
drinking
decently
flavored
beer
from
new
glarus
had
high
expectations
after
being
greeted
with
a
pretty
good
aroma
but
felt
the
taste
and
body
were
a
bit
lacking
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
pale
ale
certainly
a
sessionable
brew
and
another
notch
in
the
winner
category
for
the
folks
at
new
glarus
testimonial
id
had
a
16oz
cup
of
gnarly
gas
station
coffee
right
before
this
and
the
taste
of
the
beer
came
through
true
and
clear
after
only
a
few
sipsthats
a
powerful
brew
really
nice
all
around
d
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
all
the
time
what
a
great
beer
this
one
kinda
goes
down
like
alpha
king
light
and
i
mean
that
in
the
best
possible
way
its
refreshing
its
tasty
and
assertive
and
it
just
goes
to
show
you
that
dan
carrey
knows
what
hes
doing
i
hope
this
example
of
quality
is
what
we
can
continue
to
expect
from
new
glarus
no
more
honey
bock
please
a
solid
offering
no
doubt
always
pleased
with
what
a
technically
accurate
brewery
like
ng
can
do
d
its
nice
to
see
dan
make
a
beer
with
a
variety
of
hops
that
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
bitterness
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
a
great
replacement
for
hop
hearty
if
you
ask
me
this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
will
be
hard
to
put
down
once
the
summer
hits
nicely
brewed
dan
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
its
a
very
good
tasting
and
lighter
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
i
sit
outside
and
enjoy
the
warm
spring
weather
very
good
on
drinkability
despite
this
one
being
fairly
unexciting
its
definitely
a
good
summer
ipa
pours
a
rich
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
big
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
all
big
hopspine
resin
citrus
on
the
palate
more
hops
a
nice
malty
backbone
balanced
beautifully
with
the
hops
pine
lemon
maybe
pineapple
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
truly
reminiscent
of
a
west
coast
hop
bomb
a
great
beer
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
and
seriously
drinkable
i
could
and
probably
would
if
i
had
access
drink
this
all
day
this
is
nearly
a
five
in
the
drinkability
department
this
beer
makes
the
perfect
session
beer
a
must
try
beer
the
hop
bill
stands
out
more
in
this
than
last
time
maybe
its
because
i
have
laid
of
the
hop
bombs
and
my
palette
isnt
dead
from
the
regular
consumption
of
west
coasties
i
have
to
elevate
the
scores
for
the
abv
this
is
full
of
flavor
pours
a
slight
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
nice
fresh
ring
its
a
little
light
in
color
the
smell
was
not
overwhelming
but
i
could
smell
hops
and
grapefruitcitrus
malt
and
bready
smells
the
taste
was
better
it
has
a
hopcitrus
hit
for
sure
then
some
malts
in
the
background
its
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
its
a
straight
apa
for
sure
and
at
5
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
the
moth
feel
is
medium
not
overwhelming
but
you
know
you
are
drinking
a
crafted
brew
i
really
liked
this
one
and
picture
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
for
springsummer
reccomended
edit
had
this
one
on
tap
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
i
had
originally
remembered
nice
hop
flavor
and
balance
so
i
am
boosting
my
original
score
but
hell
this
aint
an
ipa
its
an
apa
and
that
fact
is
all
the
more
remarkable
in
its
flavor
which
goes
above
and
beyond
what
you
should
get
out
of
a
5
abv
d
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
for
someone
who
drinks
full
flavored
beer
and
a
great
beer
to
introduce
budmillercoors
drinkers
to
beers
with
a
little
more
flavor
it
goes
great
with
pizza
steak
cheese
whatever
55
d
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
it
has
a
perfect
balance
and
a
nice
bright
hop
profile
that
doesnt
come
close
to
being
bitter
all
around
very
nice
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
drinkability
the
pinnacle
of
drinkability
drinkability
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
summer
if
you
like
spotted
cow
on
hops
this
is
your
beer
d
off
the
chart
drinkability
i
pounded
a
6pack
of
this
stuff
two
nights
ago
and
never
tired
of
it
its
a
good
thing
i
ran
out
i
would
have
probably
drank
another
6er
before
passing
out
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
addition
to
ngs
summer
beer
lineup
a
killer
warm
weather
session
beer
for
sure
nicely
done
and
highly
recommended
overall
it
is
a
bit
of
an
oddity
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
typical
lowflavor
apa
its
one
of
the
best
pure
sessioners
ive
had
in
a
bit
d
this
is
going
to
make
for
a
great
summer
beer
and
maybe
forget
how
much
i
am
missing
cracked
wheat
the
lemon
type
hop
flavor
really
fits
in
nice
do
my
claim
to
fame
is
to
be
the
man
to
carry
the
second
6
pack
out
of
the
brewery
doesnt
that
win
me
something
like
another
6
pack
this
is
a
great
session
brew
and
may
need
to
buy
in
bulk
to
make
my
2010
summer
session
staple
beer
d
a
great
hop
nose
and
good
flavor
make
for
a
good
session
beer
and
dan
hit
it
on
the
head
with
this
one
no
palate
fatigue
to
speak
of
after
a
few
of
these
and
light
enough
in
the
body
as
to
not
fill
you
up
i
cannot
wait
to
crack
a
few
of
these
open
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
nice
pale
ale
that
nails
the
style
and
proves
that
new
glarus
can
do
hops
overall
if
i
was
to
think
of
a
session
ale
this
will
be
my
new
definition
ng
nailed
this
one
for
sure
i
will
have
no
problem
putting
back
a
handful
of
these
anytime
i
gotta
say
im
pretty
happy
with
moon
man
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
so
it
certainly
surpassed
those
that
said
the
aroma
is
knockout
delicious
the
flavor
is
a
clean
and
hoppy
backed
up
admirably
by
a
sweet
honeylike
character
of
the
pale
malts
with
a
somewhat
underwhelming
finish
but
a
pale
ale
this
is
and
for
what
it
is
i
think
ng
did
a
fantastic
job
im
decently
impressed
not
by
any
means
a
beer
to
be
blown
away
by
but
absolutely
true
to
the
style
and
solid
beer
at
that
just
as
they
suggest
this
is
one
to
be
consumed
at
its
absolute
freshest
and
id
say
ive
had
the
privilege
of
doing
just
that
o
very
drinkable
apa
with
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
that
leans
slightly
to
the
malt
exceptional
beer
beautifully
balanced
i
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tumbler
15
days
shy
of
the
best
by
date
on
the
bottle
great
color
amber
golden
orangeish
with
a
little
bit
of
a
haze
i
poured
it
fairly
aggressively
and
only
got
about
a
1
finger
head
which
didnt
stick
around
too
long
a
lot
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
a
very
pleasant
inviting
smell
i
could
smell
the
hops
but
it
was
a
subtle
gradual
aroma
not
an
all
out
hop
assault
to
the
nostrils
the
malt
presence
was
also
subtle
but
definitely
there
it
was
not
obliterated
by
the
hops
which
i
found
nice
for
a
change
i
would
have
given
the
taste
a
5
but
not
for
a
slight
very
slight
dry
graininess
in
the
finish
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
maybe
just
a
little
on
the
dry
side
for
my
tastes
but
even
as
i
write
that
i
cant
help
thinking
im
probably
being
too
nitpicky
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
and
will
make
this
a
goto
very
sessionable
at
5
looks
great
smells
awesome
tastes
outstanding
what
else
is
there
best
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
try
with
splash
of
lime
heaven
o
didnt
float
my
boat
in
the
mirror
pond
wonder
how
it
mightve
tasted
fresher
glad
to
try
it
though
very
good
pale
ale
pretty
close
to
sierra
nevada
pale
oh
how
things
used
to
be
this
beer
once
stood
out
with
its
hoppy
character
now
it
is
a
fairly
tame
but
reliable
pale
ale
little
bit
of
the
expected
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
very
nice
pale
ale
probably
my
number
2
after
daisy
cutter
a
little
pine
a
little
citrus
and
a
nice
but
not
overpowering
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
very
good
pale
with
strong
notes
a
standard
pale
nothing
special
here
overall
my
personal
opinion
a
nice
apa
but
nothing
to
get
all
excited
about
if
i
am
out
at
a
restaurant
or
pub
i
would
want
to
know
about
other
offerings
rather
than
just
say
give
me
a
mirror
pond
o
great
overall
apa
in
which
the
balance
and
mouthfeel
is
its
best
quality
this
is
my
go
to
bob
seger
pale
ale
like
a
rock
t
and
m
great
layers
that
follow
the
nose
but
are
more
compelling
little
more
fruit
than
in
the
nose
finishes
medium
dry
nice
body
for
a
pale
excellent
pale
ale
not
too
hoppy
had
this
on
tap
in
fountainville
pa
very
smooth
and
great
flavor
o
i
would
like
this
better
if
the
aromasflavors
were
a
bit
bolder
that
being
said
everything
is
so
pure
with
not
a
flaw
to
be
found
even
if
on
the
light
side
this
is
not
to
be
missed
no
resinous
pine
smell
from
this
ipa
but
a
very
enjoyable
clean
tasting
ipa
there
are
some
nice
earthy
smells
as
if
sniffing
a
fresh
cut
oak
barrel
lots
to
enjoy
for
the
nose
only
5
alcohol
which
is
a
nice
twist
for
an
ipa
could
absorb
many
of
these
and
maintain
as
if
drinking
pilsners
lacing
is
quite
good
with
dark
patchy
colors
on
the
glass
bitterness
is
slight
on
aftertaste
lets
you
know
the
hops
are
there
overall
a
great
ipa
for
sessions
and
enjoyment
this
is
a
world
class
beer
indeed
it
pours
beautifully
with
a
lovely
lingering
head
that
dissipates
into
a
foam
archipelago
there
is
a
distinct
chill
haze
to
the
amberorange
body
mirror
pond
leaves
distinct
tendrils
of
foam
lacing
as
it
moves
down
the
glass
the
flavour
is
wonderful
biscuit
malt
and
hoppy
there
are
definite
grapefruit
notes
that
do
a
great
job
of
quenching
your
thirst
i
first
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
during
a
scorching
hot
idaho
day
today
it
helped
cut
through
the
heat
of
a
spicy
italian
pasta
dish
mirror
pond
is
equally
suitable
in
either
situation
and
i
imagine
it
rise
to
any
occasion
overall
we
are
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
west
coast
stable
of
beerdom
we
were
first
able
to
sample
this
about
two
years
ago
on
a
road
trip
out
to
colorado
to
visit
some
friends
having
never
seen
deschutes
before
that
moment
this
became
an
obvious
first
choice
when
we
hit
that
first
brew
stop
we
happily
and
rapidly
sipped
that
first
sixpack
at
altitude
but
neglected
to
take
any
notes
worthy
of
rating
fast
forward
to
now
and
we
stumble
across
a
second
helping
at
a
meijer
in
sandusky
ohio
while
visiting
cedar
point
a
month
or
so
back
here
we
are
with
the
meaningful
rating
baton
in
hand
this
here
is
your
quintessential
nononsense
pale
ale
the
nose
comes
across
freshly
and
seriously
with
no
unnecessary
inclusions
or
deviations
the
flavoring
is
describable
in
much
the
same
way
but
is
a
bit
more
to
the
sweeter
and
more
biscuity
side
of
life
fill
in
the
gaps
with
straight
quality
and
that
is
really
what
youre
left
with
a
nice
balanced
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
and
perhaps
the
beer
was
just
old
enough
to
be
muted
because
it
didnt
taste
stale
at
all
gold
standard
for
me
on
pale
ales
deep
gold
in
color
slim
head
respectable
clarity
the
aroma
is
clean
some
fresh
hops
balanced
with
lightly
toasted
malt
semisweet
drinkable
overall
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
deschutes
brewery
and
it
is
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
it
was
really
well
balance
with
a
sweet
malt
and
the
hops
were
very
much
to
my
liking
the
5
abv
means
you
can
enjoy
more
than
one
the
hops
are
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
looking
forward
to
more
from
this
brewer
serving
type
bottle
pours
clear
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
moderate
has
a
citrus
maybe
apple
aroma
with
slight
piney
hoppiness
bready
malt
with
a
mild
bitter
hop
nice
bitter
aftertaste
very
good
beer
very
drinkable
session
beer
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
pale
ale
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
and
am
glad
that
deschutes
is
distributing
in
my
area
there
was
a
lot
of
hype
when
this
came
to
wisconsin
not
sure
if
we
got
a
bad
batch
but
the
beer
was
terrible
almost
zero
hop
presence
and
a
very
thin
mouth
feel
good
basic
ipa
good
medium
to
lift
body
citric
flavors
a
tad
bit
disappointed
thought
it
was
a
very
solid
pale
like
as
pale
ale
as
a
pale
ale
could
be
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
definitely
drink
again
would
definitely
buy
just
didnt
find
it
to
be
spectacular
definitely
a
hop
heads
apa
not
a
standout
by
any
means
in
my
book
though
again
let
me
reiterate
a
very
good
and
solid
beer
but
not
great
or
exceptional
drink
it
if
you
get
the
opportunity
but
dont
expect
the
world
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
definitely
worth
trying
d
a
decent
brew
perhaps
better
when
younger
i
drank
this
about
a
week
past
the
best
by
date
3
5
o
solid
apa
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
a
full
flavored
brew
that
is
session
worth
and
wont
knock
you
one
your
ass
o
ok
as
good
as
nw
pale
ale
gets
3
75
great
beer
to
introduce
people
to
craft
beer
with
overall
4
05
this
was
good
if
a
bit
breadyyeasty
for
a
pale
ale
yet
added
a
nice
touch
the
hop
presence
is
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
but
i
couldve
used
a
little
more
these
are
minor
flaws
it
is
a
clean
solid
pale
ale
and
sometimes
thats
all
i
need
amberish
in
color
with
a
caramel
yet
fruity
aroma
no
bitter
aftertaste
but
hoppy
enough
to
satisfy
the
hops
fan
and
mild
enough
to
pacify
the
i
hate
hoppy
beer
drinker
nice
inbetween
brew
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
but
not
light
beyond
all
other
styles
of
beer
ambers
are
my
preferred
favorite
for
some
reason
the
mirror
pond
really
hits
the
mark
right
on
the
head
for
me
theres
notes
of
hop
bite
caramel
oak
and
flavors
of
red
meat
and
sausages
i
cant
explain
why
but
after
drinking
german
weizens
belgian
doubles
and
triples
or
roasty
porters
this
beer
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
no
harsh
after
bite
or
lingering
tastes
crisp
but
even
on
the
tongue
ill
be
stocking
my
fridge
with
this
one
for
quite
awhile
mirror
pond
put
deschutes
on
the
map
and
its
still
their
biggest
hit
as
with
a
lot
of
apas
i
find
them
a
wee
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
wont
enjoy
it
i
buy
this
from
time
to
time
so
im
still
a
fan
but
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
unbelievable
as
everyone
else
does
light
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
hoppy
lemon
aroma
with
some
earthy
tones
taste
is
an
earthy
lemon
citrus
taste
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
too
complex
o
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
perfectly
balanced
its
a
classic
apa
o
a
terrific
pale
ale
i
could
drink
this
any
time
any
place
o
i
see
why
this
gets
high
marks
it
embodies
many
things
that
are
good
about
gentle
apa
styles
unobtrusive
malt
and
yeast
delicate
hop
bill
and
much
skill
in
the
application
of
the
hopping
schedule
has
produced
a
very
fine
apa
ap
325
ar
375
sab
375
sens
35
cj
35
o
is
there
a
finer
apa
around
i
think
not
overall
4
04
as
indifferent
as
i
am
to
pale
ales
this
one
wasnt
bad
at
all
in
fact
it
was
pretty
good
the
hops
were
there
but
they
werent
overdone
they
were
flavorful
but
subdued
enough
to
taste
the
other
flavors
wheat
lemonorange
peel
coriander
if
one
is
looking
for
a
good
pale
ale
look
no
further
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
because
of
my
sensitivity
to
bitter
beers
but
i
can
rate
this
one
on
its
own
merit
its
good
o
very
nice
complexity
to
the
aroma
aroma
is
also
well
balanced
definitely
a
hop
forward
pale
ale
bitterness
overshadows
sweetness
i
prefer
the
inversion
ipa
to
this
but
this
reflects
the
mainstream
ipa
style
more
truly
45
overall
not
a
bad
apa
although
i
feel
like
it
is
rated
a
little
higher
than
it
should
be
the
graininess
is
just
a
little
too
much
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
again
overall
this
is
totally
unlike
burning
river
much
sweeter
and
then
this
astringency
really
balanced
definitely
would
buy
again
but
i
could
see
this
being
too
sweet
after
a
couple
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
been
drinking
this
ale
on
and
off
for
years
and
it
never
fails
to
please
i
agree
with
the
bros
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
fresh
crisp
and
hoppy
and
one
of
my
new
summer
favs
first
had
it
on
tap
and
was
pleased
to
have
as
equally
good
experience
with
bottled
overall
excellent
apa
one
of
my
favorites
well
balanced
beer
hazy
bright
orange
the
head
lingers
only
briefly
falling
to
a
minimal
collar
of
lace
soft
maltiness
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
mild
pine
the
flavor
is
evenly
balanced
with
pale
malt
and
cascade
hops
playing
equally
important
roles
an
easy
drinking
apa
5
abv
o
a
fruity
an
slightly
mild
apa
update
found
a
very
fresh
bottle
from
the
inlaws
when
i
came
home
from
work
best
by
date
of
111314
still
a
very
nice
brew
but
not
noticeably
hoppier
juicier
etc
than
my
previous
review
still
a
good
solid
apa
i
was
anxious
to
get
started
so
i
got
a
nice
heavyhanded
pour
going
the
bynow
predictable
outcome
was
a
pseudocascade
followed
by
the
production
of
three
fingers
of
dense
rocky
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepamber
srm
5
7
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
primarily
of
grapefruit
but
underlain
by
a
light
mintiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
kind
of
soft
on
the
tongue
the
taste
was
mellow
kind
of
tealike
with
a
light
citrusy
tartness
finish
was
likewise
mellow
and
unobtrusive
if
i
could
only
have
one
apa
forever
it
would
not
be
this
one
to
be
honest
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
me
this
is
a
porch
sipper
itll
do
well
for
bbqs
firesides
and
boating
trips
its
better
than
anything
youll
get
from
the
big
name
brands
and
its
just
as
smooth
add
in
the
fact
that
it
has
better
ingredients
and
was
perfected
by
people
who
seem
to
have
mastered
their
trade
and
youve
got
a
better
beer
to
hang
out
with
than
the
competition
porch
sippers
the
flavor
is
a
little
lacking
so
i
wouldnt
consider
it
something
i
would
celebrate
with
or
look
for
on
an
extensive
menu
but
its
a
good
six
pack
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
the
end
of
the
day
when
youre
not
looking
so
much
for
flavor
but
for
refreshment
and
a
reprieve
the
abvll
get
ya
there
allinall
good
beer
my
friends
deschutes
gave
us
another
gift
with
this
one
this
might
fall
slightly
outside
of
typical
pale
ales
because
of
the
big
flavor
but
its
a
fantastic
beer
definitely
a
worthwhile
goto
few
standard
5
strength
beers
pack
this
much
flavor
wellbalanced
too
final
word
friend
recommended
and
i
was
a
little
disappointed
it
was
good
but
didnt
stack
up
compared
to
others
in
fairness
this
was
close
to
getting
pulled
based
on
brewdate
i
wasnt
impressed
but
would
easily
pick
this
over
any
macro
swill
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
bready
malts
and
grassyearthy
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
for
the
most
part
just
a
little
bitter
the
malt
seems
to
cover
up
the
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
good
for
a
pale
ale
a
nice
summer
beer
nothing
incredible
here
just
a
good
apa
final
word
highly
recommended
beer
for
practically
any
purpose
this
is
just
as
enjoyable
at
a
great
beer
pub
as
it
is
as
a
take
home
six
pack
phenomenally
well
balanced
and
well
rounded
full
flavor
with
a
gentle
abv
o
a
great
pale
ale
a
top
15
beer
and
a
top
7
pale
ale
worth
a
case
o
it
improved
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
hidden
by
the
chill
perhaps
the
mouthfeel
is
just
where
it
should
be
medium
bodied
average
levels
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
it
is
drinkable
refreshing
very
well
balanced
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more

echoes
this

more
toasty
malts
and
a
tangy
citruspine
hop
character
near
the
finish
a
great
and
balanced
session
brew
and
simply
an
exemplary
classic
pale
ale
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
pale
ale
that
allows
the
flavors
to
cling
to
palate
nicely
cheers
o
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
would
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
sessionable
very
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
with
both
being
allowed
to
showcase
their
aromasflavors
luscious
mouthfeel
with
that
good
hop
burn
waiting
for
you
in
the
finish
complements
the
carbonation
nicely
which
wavers
in
and
out
but
shows
signs
of
being
really
bushytailed
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
delicious
drinkable
brew
o
a
solid
pale
ale
reminds
me
of
a
cleaner
hopback
amber
o
the
bottle
might
be
encroaching
on
the
final
days
of
its
best
by
date
but
its
still
got
a
little
life
in
it
deschutes
mirror
pond
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
hoppy
notes
but
at
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
making
it
a
nicetopair
belly
up
to
the
bar
beer
this
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
bitter
smelling
for
a
plain
pale
ale
upon
tasting
it
is
surprising
the
aroma
is
so
hoppy
because
overall
the
beer
is
very
simple
tasting
while
having
a
crisp
clean
finish
this
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
candy
sweet
very
entry
level
no
ibu
bite
and
cloys
a
bit
slight
sandpaper
bitterness
as
it
warms
but
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
apa
i
was
looking
at
reviews
of
this
earlier
today
and
decided
to
go
for
it
not
sure
why
earlier
posts
mention
great
hops
in
this
one
just
not
feeling
that
maybe
my
six
pack
is
bad
but
this
is
similar
to
budweiser
very
disappointed
yep
aal
taste
all
the
way
another
impressive
buy
from
my
ohio
buying
spree
so
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
to
try
some
of
deschutes
offerings
this
apa
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
hue
with
very
little
off
white
head
it
does
retain
a
nice
film
and
a
very
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
deep
and
malty
but
with
a
pleasant
hoppy
bitter
bite
and
a
little
roastiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
almost
a
bit
too
light
id
love
a
little
more
coating
and
chew
to
this
beer
maybe
if
it
was
unfiltered
this
may
be
perfect
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
malty
sweetness
hoppy
bitterness
and
an
almost
funky
belgian
yeast
flavor
all
play
together
beautifully
this
is
an
excellent
apa
and
just
makes
more
excited
to
taste
the
other
two
deschutes
offerings
i
bought
last
week
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
pale
ale
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
a
great
balance
and
so
easy
to
drink
superb
deep
copper
amber
slightly
chill
hazed
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
and
fine
speckled
lace
left
evenly
as
it
dwindles
down
aroma
complements
malts
and
hops
so
well
slight
sweet
breadiness
herbal
pine
and
citric
notes
complement
the
soft
baked
bread
qualities
pungent
hops
reach
out
to
the
nares
as
it
warms
really
nice
american
pale
ale
thats
been
around
since
1988
wow
flavor
is
amply
hopped
but
round
malts
mild
sugar
coated
hops
fresh
baked
bread
biscuit
quality
a
hint
of
chalky
yeast
packet
herbal
rolling
hops
citric
notes
pine
earthy
dankness
is
mild
yet
expressive
in
the
hop
components
of
this
beer
i
grabbed
a
sixer
without
hesitation
when
i
saw
this
one
at
one
of
my
local
stops
mouthfeel
is
packed
with
crisp
flowing
carbonation
carries
light
hop
resins
across
the
palate
not
much
going
on
but
the
feel
is
very
natural
no
forced
over
carbonation
on
the
palate
perfectly
balanced
well
engineered
pale
ale
with
character
all
day
overall
this
is
the
bread
and
butter
of
this
great
brewery
out
of
bend
oregon
someone
started
making
this
at
home
in
the
80s
and
had
a
eureka
moment
overall
a
nice
smooth
and
flavorful
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
has
enough
hops
to
give
it
nice
fruity
flavors
no
alcohol
is
noticeable
just
balanced
well
and
easy
to
enjoy
in
a
medium
body
with
plenty
of
support
without
going
too
strong
or
heavy
theres
a
nice
creamy
quality
on
the
palate
with
a
consistent
crsipness
supporting
o
i
was
excited
that
deschutes
started
distribution
in
ky
and
wasnt
disappointed
this
is
an
outstanding
pale
ale
this
may
be
my
favorite
from
deschutes
thus
far
as
it
reflects
the
style
well
but
has
its
own
original
take
mirror
pond
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
nice
mellow
floral
aroma
the
taste
has
a
noticeable
hoppy
flavor
mild
but
finishes
with
a
rich
biscuit
flavor
good
feel
good
flavors
and
very
drinkable
overall
its
a
nice
pale
ale
strong
biscuit
flavors
make
sit
rather
unique
o
another
solid
offering
from
deschutes
im
bout
to
have
my
3rd
bottle
of
the
night
definitely
a
session
beer
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
with
good
flavoring
and
bittering
variety
the
hop
flavor
lacks
a
bit
in
comparison
to
the
aroma
o
a
delicious
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
out
there
with
a
nice
orangeyslightly
tropical
taste
o
an
amazing
apa
this
is
most
likely
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
ale
displays
a
gorgeous
texture
and
flavor
profile
the
fact
that
i
could
drink
this
all
day
reminds
me
of
why
this
beer
is
considered
a
classic
for
fans
of
the
style
i
cannot
recommend
it
highly
enough
if
this
beer
came
out
today
instead
of
years
ago
i
wonder
just
how
well
it
would
be
accepted
i
definitely
like
it
but
i
think
the
crowds
who
gravitate
towards
big
bruising
citrusy
beers
would
shun
this
one
and
consider
it
a
bit
dated
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
those
new
to
craft
beers
if
youve
been
drinking
craft
for
a
while
and
are
just
getting
around
to
this
one
you
may
be
a
little
disappointed
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
many
pale
ales
out
there
today
that
surpass
this
one
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
id
grab
it
if
you
happen
to
come
across
it
and
havent
tried
it
yet
overall
this
is
a
very
competent
well
made
pale
o
pretty
good
pale
ale
its
worth
a
try
this
isnt
really
an
exciting
pale
ale
it
personally
reminds
me
more
of
an
irish
red
ale
this
is
ultimately
boring
and
forgettable
this
is
my
first
experience
with
deschutes
so
i
guess
this
isnt
the
best
first
impression
but
its
all
good
because
there
are
more
goodies
from
them
for
me
to
try
out
best
by
date
on
bottle
was
only
23
months
away
so
i
will
consider
rereviewing
at
a
later
date
with
a
fresher
sample
othis
was
a
beer
with
a
twist
the
smell
makes
you
believe
it
is
a
pale
ale
at
the
first
sip
but
the
after
that
i
would
have
thought
this
was
an
ipa
a
very
good
pale
ale
great
balance
not
overly
aggressive
or
assertive
excellent
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
this
is
my
favorite
pale
ale
every
other
ale
pales
in
comparison
ha
this
beer
has
a
wonderfully
balanced
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
the
low
abv
allows
one
to
drown
the
stomach
in
a
short
period
of
time
if
one
is
not
careful
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
green
flash
imperial
pint
glass
lovely
light
copper
color
nice
inch
head
or
so
smell
is
floral
fresh
piney
hops
pine
really
stands
out
to
me
taste
is
refreshing
and
mildly
hoppy
wonderful
american
pale
ale
had
the
pleasure
to
go
to
the
brewery
in
bend
and
its
even
better
there
cheers
overall
still
being
somewhat
of
a
hop
newbie
i
was
impressed
by
the
balance
of
this
apa
it
is
hop
forward
but
the
malts
balance
perfectly
and
the
bitterness
only
mildly
lingers
and
dries
the
tongue
kind
of
like
biting
on
a
little
chunk
of
orange
peel
very
drinkable
as
a
ba
just
getting
into
the
craft
beer
scene
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
hop
character
but
cant
quite
take
the
high
ibus
yet
if
this
beer
was
a
christmas
gift
it
is
the
gift
you
never
knew
you
wanted
but
now
you
cant
imagine
being
without
light
bronze
to
brown
in
color
i
get
a
good
inch
of
foam
resting
on
top
with
good
lacing
and
great
clarity
i
smell
light
malt
and
pacific
northwest
piney
hops
the
hops
and
malt
are
well
balanced
i
get
piney
hop
aftertaste
followed
by
delicate
malt
backbone
this
is
a
very
smooth
session
beer
packed
with
flavor
glad
i
randomly
bought
this
in
a
mix
and
match
six
pack
at
my
local
store
this
is
my
new
favorite
chill
out
beer
when
i
dont
want
to
assault
my
tastebuds
i
will
sip
on
this
for
sure
pours
a
murky
orange
amber
hue
with
considerable
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
classic
apa
citrus
gooseberriesblack
currants
tangy
caramel
malts
and
a
little
toasted
grain
palate
follows
the
nose
with
some
brown
bread
gummy
candy
sweetness
and
toasted
grain
propping
up
orange
marmalade
green
grass
mint
and
chamomile
floral
notes
along
with
a
little
pine
resin
a
bit
chewy
but
skewed
towards
crisp
and
dry
finish
is
like
a
highquality
semisweet
citrus
soda
clean
crisp
and
smooth
a
little
pine
and
fresh
earth
accumulate
on
the
palate
along
with
another
bitter
flavor
that
i
am
having
some
trouble
placing
its
a
bit
seltzerlike
or
chalkymedicinal
in
character
wellbalanced
between
tangy
rich
malts
and
classic
american
west
coast
aroma
hops
very
true
to
style
not
tropical
and
dank
like
many
american
ipas
but
certainly
has
citrus
twang
and
ample
4mmp
character
the
chemical
compound
that
gives
american
hops
a
black
currant
character
find
this
brew
as
fresh
as
possible
to
get
more
of
the
bright
top
note
flavors
great
session
beer
and
something
i
will
bring
to
a
gathering
of
the
beer
proletariat
to
introduce
them
to
the
world
beyond
shitty
macrolagers
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
i
like
it
and
would
have
it
more
often
if
the
code
dates
were
fresher
sometimes
i
find
this
beer
on
the
shelf
past
the
freshness
date
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
without
affecting
me
too
much
because
of
a
high
alcohol
content
i
recommend
it
and
i
am
going
to
have
another
decent
beer
but
lacking
overall
flavor
bright
orange
color
looks
inviting
and
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
but
the
overall
flavor
falls
short
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
maltiness
out
of
a
pale
ale
i
think
it
most
certainly
fits
the
style
of
a
pale
ale
just
not
my
favorite
i
think
this
was
a
wonderful
example
of
a
west
coast
style
pale
ale
some
would
even
mistake
it
as
an
ipa
i
think
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
last
time
i
had
it
was
on
tap
at
triple
crown
in
sd
on
adams
street
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
deschutes
mirror
pond
pale
ale
3

on

at
a
tacoma
raineirs

deep
copper
pour
with
a
creamy
head
citrus
and
malt
aroma
flavor
follows
with
citrus
hops
and
a
strong
malt
backbone
a
nice
bit
of
grapefruit
or
mango
here
to
go
along
with
the
caramelly
malts
finish
is
not
as
clean
as
i
had
hoped
not
bad
and
easy
drinking
brew
that
went
well
with
baseball
the
verdict
very
good
everything
a
pale
ale
should
be
with
a
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
sweet
and
bitter
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
sierra
nevada
or
sweetwater
but
its
not
very
far
behind
at
all
check
it
out
httpyoutu
bedhis2lobdg
overall
one
of
the
best
craft
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
my
young
beer
career
lol
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
freshby
date
which
is
getting
close
to
the
present
date
didnt
matter
though
it
was
enjoyed
not
an
overwhelming
smell
little
hoppy
and
malt
smell
the
taste
was
of
course
full
of
the
cascade
hops
but
a
pleasant
carbonation
along
with
a
mild
fruity
background
i
did
find
a
bit
of
an
odd
aftertaste
however
i
countered
that
by
not
waiting
long
between
tastes
a
very
nice
pale
ale
which
is
nice
in
the
summer
as
refreshing
with
enough
hop
flavor
deschutes
is
a
reliable
brewery
in
my
mind
overall
an
okay
pale
ale
honestly
im
not
that
impressed
with
the
beers
ive
had
from
deschutes
the
mirror
pond
was
a
light
beer
all
around
the
aroma
appearance
flavor
were
all
light
the
aroma
was
crisp
with
some
fruity
and
floral
hits
to
it
the
appearance
was
an
orangey
and
gold
the
flavor
was
also
a
fruityflowery
combo
the
beer
overall
was
an
excellent
version
of
an
apa
drinkability
this
is
tasty
and
very
drinkable
there
are
better
pale
ales
out
there
but
this
is
definitely
a
pale
ale
and
not
an
ipa
wannabe
overall
an
above
average
beer
thats
worth
a
try
but
deschutes
does
make
better
products
overall
im
not
blown
away
by
this
ale
but
at
the
same
time
it
tastes
pretty
darn
good
and
serves
its
purpose
its
very
refreshing
im
more
of
a
fan
of
lagers
and
darker
more
robust
ales
than
i
am
of
pale
ales
but
this
is
really
a
good
example
of
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
pick
it
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
cheers
to
good
health
and
good
beer
hoppy
fruity
floral
spicy
malty
a
wonderfully
balanced

ale
great
to

is
more
towards
the
malt
than
the
hops
compared
to
many
apas
i
come
across
now
well
crafted
brew
o
a
very
solid
well
balanced
pale
ale
definitely
something
recommended
during
warm
weather
as
it
is
quite
refreshing
o
overall
fairly
easy
to
consume
fresh
with
a
gentle
hop
dryness
in
the
middle
six
pack
worthy
o
a
great
brew
thats
quintessential
for
any
fans
of
the
style
and
newcomers
alike
balanced
and
refreshing
flavors
with
a
smooth
drinkability
make
this
one
extremely
sessionable
especially
on
warm
summer
daysnights
overall
a
really
solid
apa
glad
i
bought
it
o
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
maybe
it
tastes
this
way
because
it
is
so
close
to
the
bbd
or
maybe
the
friend
who
gave
it
to
me
let
it
get
hot
or
something
a
fine
pub
ale
nice
pale
ale
from
deschutes
o
this
is
the
best
thing
i
had
from
deschutes
yet
very
solid
and
well
rounded
lots
of
flavor
really
well
balanced
and
a
wonderful
example
for
the
american
style
the
hops
are
used
with
great
care
both
showing
just
a
little
bit
of
flash
while
maintaining
a
wonderful
balance
in
the
beer
o
a
good
pale
ale
i
feel
like
the
bready
malt
is
a
little
strong
in
flavor
and
impedes
drinkability
but
imparts
flavor
beyond
the
hops
and
slows
the
drinker
down
a
bit
rjt
o
a
very
balanced
and
flavorful
apa
there
are
alot
of
overly
hoppy
apas
that
make
kill
your
pallet
after
one
pint
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
great
for
an
afternoon
bbq
overall
good
refreshing
pale
ale
for
a
sunny
day
o
a
solid
drinkable
and
refreshing
maltier
pale
ale
oi
remember
disliking
this
beer
the
last
time
i
had
it
maybe
four
years
ago
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
goodlooking
it
is
and
how
nice
it
smells
the
taste
while
something
of
a
letdown
compared
to
looks
and
smell
is
not
bad
but
it
loses
some
of
the
hoppy
sharpness
that
makes
the
smell
so
appealing
allinall
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
an
apa
o
a
well
balanced
but
hoppy
pale
ale
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
in
the
spring
or
summer
very
flavorful
great
session
beer
one
of
the
finer
pale
ales
out
there
i
think
it
gets
over
looked
because
it
is
so
easy
to
get
but
with
great
tradition
is
great
beer
i
dont
think
they
have
to
change
a
thing
great
citrus
notes
wonderful
aroma
and
you
can
actually
have
a
couple
of
them
without
being
completely
loaded
that
seems
to
be
a
problem
with
a
lot
of
these
beers
these
days
nothing
better
on
a
sunny
after
noon
orangeamber
in
color
filtered
clean
and
bright
with
a
wispyfeathery
offwhite
head
nice
snotty
lace
sticking
around
mostly
a
floralsoapy
hop
aroma
toasty
pale
malt
just
sneaking
in
underneath
to
balance
the
floralsoapy
thing
certainly
comes
across
in
the
taste
refreshing
matched
against
some
pleasant
limegrapefruit
hop
flavors
supporting
malts
show
a
bit
more
here
but
never
really
give
the
esters
and
hops
much
of
a
fuss

tart

quite

maybe
a

than

than
desirable
in

having
a

is
no
crime
a
really
solid
apa
the
invigorating
hopester
combo
is
showcase
here
definite
warmweather
treat
i
remember
drinking
this
earlier
in
the
year
from
the
same
store
and
thus
probably
past
its
due
date
i
thought
it
to
be
one
of
the
finest
american
style
west
coast
pale
ales
around
i
e
hoppy
pale
ales
even
though
the
bottle
was
old
i
still
found
it
to
be
complex
enough
and
easydrinking
enough
to
be
enjoyable
and
well
worth
the
2
14
clams
i
forked
over
for
the
bottle
like
a
rita
hayworth
hair
flip
raul
enjoys
this
poured
a
rich
amber
color
tan
head
which
dissipated
rapidly
smell
reminded
me
of
lightly
toasted
bagels
very
earthy
taste
was
much
the
same
earthy
wholegrain
oats
crackerlike
sweetness
is
present
yet
faint
but
well
balanced
with
the
mild
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
very
pleasing
did
i
mention
it
is
very
earthy
i
had
another
and
another
and
deschutes
flagship
beer
sets
the
standard
for
northwest
pale
ale
for
a
pale
ale
this
beer
ventures
into
a
realm
of
comfort
and
warmth
most
dont
explore
im
relatively
new
to
the
style
but
i
find
this
particular
pale
ale
to
be
rather
interesting
due
to
its
complex
profile
the
hops
are
noticeable
but
they
seem
to
take
on
an
equal
playing
field
with
the
malts
and
caramel
flavors
this
beer
offers
which
is
a
delightful
spin
on
the
pale
ale
in
one
word
rustic
this
beer
should
not
be
overlooked
overall
excellent
american
pale
ale
very
refreshing
the
smell
may
throw
you
off
into
thinking
this
is
a
hop
monster
but
its
really
not
whereas
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
it
seems
to
be
more
on
the
smell
highly
recommended
quite
drinkable
and
lowkey
from
the
12
oz
bottle
at
ajs
fine
foods
in
chandler
overall
a
classic
northwest
pale
ale
everything
about
it
screams
cascadia
the
hop
and
malt
balance
the
fruity
yeast
and
the
full
mouthfeel
as
an
added
bonus
it
is
a
touchstone
that
homebrewers
and
brewers
alike
can
use
for
tasting
the
intricacies
of
the
cascade
hop
i
overlook
this
one
to
much
great
pale
ale
nice
all
around
pours
a
bit
darker
than
your
average
pale
ale
brown
to
orange
in
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
head
is
retained
well
and
nice
spotted
lacing
on
the
glass
based
on
aroma
alone
you
would
think
this
is
a
darker
beer
earthy
malt
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
bit
of
body
yet
still
light
and
refreshing
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
produced
a
creamy
white
head
featured
excellent
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
contained
malted
grain
citric
lemons
and
herbal
hops
medium
bodied
there
was
a
nice
foundation
of
malted
grain
apples
yeasty
esters
orange
and
lemon
citrus
and
piney
hops
this
is
a
very
nicely
hopped
apa
if
you
enjoy
micro
brewed
apas
this
is
one
of
the
best
this
might
not
be
as
carefully
crafted
and
have
as
many
ingredients
as
other
higher
rated
beers
but
i
have
not
yet
found
a
better
drinking
beer
its
smooth
full
of
taste
but
not
too
strong
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
that
really
respects
the
pale
ale
moniker
also
goes
for
a
great
price
in
the
northwest
which
really
rubs
in
the
fact
that
i
now
live
on
the
east
coast
because
this
stuff
also
destroys
anything
from
the
boston
or
brooklyn
breweries
o
ive
heard
about
this
beer
for
a
while
now
from
a
fellow
ba
the
girlfriend
was
able
to
score
some
for
me
on
a
recent
trip
to
chicago
cant
say
that
im
disappointed
at
all
smooth
easy
drinking
apa
my
first
from
deschutes
and
hopefully
not
my
last
would
seek
some
out
again
for
sure
but
probably
wouldnt
go
bonkers
if
i
didnt
have
it
well
made
american
pale
ale
its
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
solid
apa
between
this
and
snpa
they
represent
the
style
very
well
depending
on
the
price
i
might
get
this
over
snpa
all
in
all
if
youre
in
deschutes
distro
this
should
be
a
staple
o
because
this
brew
is
so
well
balanced
both
in
aroma
and
taste
it
really
lends
itself
to
be
quite
sessionable
the
5
abv
doesnt
hurt
either
a
fantastic
example
if
the
style
and
bone
that
stands
out
in
a
market
crowded
by
the
style
smoothe
and
crisp
finish
really
good
example
of
the
style
quite
drinkable
mirror
pond
has
made
its
mark
as
one
of
the
few
goto
apas
ive
been
getting
for
the
past
years
whenever
im
in
the
mood
for
one
it
definitely
is
on
the
sweeter
side
although
the
5
abv
and
easy
drinkable
aspects
make
it
a
classic
beer
of
its
type
this
one
in
particular
is
the
most
balanced
of
deschutes
offerings
and
a
crowd
pleaser
want
to
find
a
gateway
beer
that
will
turn
people
on
to
craft
this
is
one
of
the
main
ones
to
pick
for
sure
the
beer
is
golden
to
copper
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
offers
some
bready
malts
biscuits
light
caramels
a
touch
of
hops
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
malty
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
more
of
an
english
style
brew
than
the
hop
forward
american
offerings
tasty
this
one
disappears
quickly
verdict
at
best
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
its
fairly
refreshing
at
times
but
compared
to
many
other
pale
ales
out
there
this
just
doesnt
stack
up
will
buy
again
if
on
sale
and
sierra
nevada
pale
isnt
mostly
for
the
longneck
bottles
for
use
with
my
homebrew
labels
are
easy
to
remove
not
bad
a
little
too
bitter
on
the
finish
but
sweet
and
fruity
on
the
nose
seems
to
lack
a
strong
malt
base
wow
this
is
a
good
beer
i
believe
this
is
my
first
from
deschutes
and
i
cant
wait
to
find
other
goodnesses
from
thia
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
with
thick
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
smell
is
very
subtle
sweet
malts
and
fresh
bittering
hops
the
taste
starts
with
a
sharp
bitter
then
a
smooth
sweet
caramel
malt
takes
over
fro
a
nice
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
pale
ale
absolute
session
o
a
very
wellbalanced
apa
with
a
great
blend
of
malt
and
hops
not
inyourface
but
definitely
embracing
the
hoppiness
of
the
style
well
worth
a
try
for
studying
the
style
i
tried
this
right
after
a
belhaven
the
belhaven
was
superior
in
my
opinion
mirror
pond
to
me
is
almost
fruity
to
belhavens
nutty
doesnt
finish
as
clean
as
the
belhaven
my
wife
did
not
like
it
and
thats
usually
a
good
indication
that
a
beer
has
some
unwanted
aftertaste
o
well
cant
say
i
didnt
give
it
a
fair
chance
this
one
just
doesnt
come
together
for
me
bitter
off
notes
along
with
a
weak
malt
body
and
harsh
astringency
leaves
me
unimpressed
again
will
not
try
for
a
3rd
time
overall
this
is
a
really
great
everyday
drinking
beer
they
are
hard
to
come
by
so
i
am
glad
deschutes
came
to
cape
girardeau
o
this
beer
hits
every
metric
to
make
a
great
beer
in
my
book
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
simple
enough
to
be
immensely
drinkable
to
answer
the
labels
question
ccrs
chronicle
cheating
maybe
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brassamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
grass
flowers
and
light
toffee
almost
nothing
makes
it
all
the
way
to
my
strils
but
i
do
get
the
general
idea
of
some
of
it
i
assume
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
amped
up
to
proper
volumes
and
with
some
additional
mild
orange
zest
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
indeed
nuff
said
ooverall
a
nice
sessionable
pale
ale
from
deschutes
overall
as
of
this
review
this
is
brand
new
to
chicago
and
all
over
the
binnys
beverage
stores
in
the
areaive
tried
this
and
the
porter
havent
reviewed
it
yet
and
i
have
to
say
the
hype
is
a
bit
more
than
the
beer
can
stand
up
toits
good
and
maybe
its
just
me
but
im
not
feeling
this
new
style
of
nw
apasambers
and
reds
are
flavors
of
beer
that
i
typically
avoid
and
this
one
is
not
a
far
cry
from
thatits
good
and
has
good
flavor
is
drinkable
and
with
only
5
0
abv
its
a
sessionable
brewdeschutes
rates
really
high
so
like
i
said
maybe
its
just
me
so
even
though
i
put
this
one
in
the
average
range
its
probably
worth
the
gamble
on
your
end3
5
5
a
solid
session
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
probably
my
least
favorite
from
deschutes
to
this
point
and
at
a
3
5
that
clearly
shows
that
deschutes
is
worldclass
this
is
an
exceptional
pale
ale
pouring
with
a
light
copper
color
and
gorgeous
clarity
its
bright
bold
and
balanced
with
a
citrusy
hop
character
that
stands
way
out
front
in
the
nose
and
leads
the
way
towards
a
clean
and
malty
taste
that
reminds
me
of
toasted
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
without
being
watery
or
oily
and
i
would
call
the
carbonation
level
perfect
its
not
overly
complex
and
i
would
argue
its
a
bit
too
hoppy
to
be
marketed
as
a
straight
laced
pale
ale
but
its
highly
enjoyable
and
a
great
beer
to
serve
to
friends
who
are
curious
and
beginning
to
dabble
in
craft
beer
mirror
pond
will
be
the
one
to
convert
them
o
an
excellent
pale
ale
i
am
every
happy
i
was
finally
able
to
try
this
ale
and
see
what
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
it
truly
is
this
is
a
really
good
tasting
pale
ale
cant
wait
to
try
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
extremely
wellbalanced
and
incredibly
easydrinking
the
body
had
a
decent
amount
of
english
malt
and
hopping
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
english
pale
this
is
an
easy
drinker
it
is
a
pretty
good
offering
overall
this
is
a
pale
ale
which
is
fairly
simple
in
its
flavor
but
its
very
good
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
its
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
can
trust
will
deliver
in
terms
of
taste
o
my
first
deschutes
offering
and
while
i
wasnt
blown
away
this
is
a
good
offering
thats
different
from
the
typical
pale
ale
id
love
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
and
id
doubly
love
it
if
deschutes
distributed
to
maryland
a
great
pair
with
food
pale
ale
o
an
awesome
beer
and
a
great
example
of
what
oregon
beers
are
all
about
deschutes
shows
why
it
sets
the
standard
once
again
deschutes
makes
beer
that
is
mass
produced
but
still
has
the
attention
to
detail
that
microbreweries
command
i
am
proud
to
have
deschutes
represent
the
pacific
nw
if
you
are
visiting
oregon
or
the
pacific
nw
make
sure
to
try
this
one
if
anyone
knows
of
something
thats
available
in
ct
that
comes
close
to
mirror
pond
let
me
know
overall
an
easy
drinking
pale
that
surely
would
be
a
staple
if
it
was
distributed
here
final
thoughts
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
amazing
someone
new
to
craft
beer
would
likely
enjoy
this
one
would
i
drink
it
again
no
but
deschutes
has
a
whole
line
up
of
other
great
offerings
o
just
an
excellent
pale
ale
i
could
and
sometimes
do
drink
this
all
night
tall
rocky
ivory
head
tops
an
amber
colored
ale
great
retention
and
just
stellar
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aromas
and
tastes
are
very
similar
with
notes
of
bready
malt
caramel
toffee
earthy
citrus
tones
somewhat
fruity
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
medium
excellently
balanced
overall
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
regardless
of
the
best
by
date
it
was
fine
o
this
is
a
nicely
hopped
beer
although
as
is
common
in
west
coast
pale
ales
the
malt
is
weak
and
too
sweet
nevertheless
its
a
solid
pale
ale
for
the
style
and
quite
drinkable
overall
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
smooth
pale
ale
that
flowed
down
like
water
nicely
balanced
malt
accentuated
just
so
with
cascade
hops
time
and
time
again
this
is
a
winner
and
in
my
fridge
very
interesting
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
drinks
like
an
ipa
in
a
blind
taste
i
would
even
guess
its
an
ipa
right
up
front
there
is
a
punch
of
bitterness
followed
by
a
wonderful
caramel
covered
pine
flavor
and
finishes
with
freshly
squeezed
orange
juice
smooth
to
drink
with
low
carbonation
and
a
light
body
just
wonderful
overall
overallvery
chugable
a
great
ipa
for
beginners
i
cant
imagine
someone
not
liking
this
beer
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
fantastic
introduction
into
craft
brews
but
its
not
up
to
par
with
some
of
the
better
pales
ive
had
nothing
revolutionary
by
todays
standards
but
deschutes
has
such
great
quality
in
their
brews
id
drink
this
again
and
i
might
get
the
chance
as
ive
seen
it
in
kegs
in
alberta
and
6ers
in
bc
already
but
they
werent
cheap
if
i
remember
correctly
overall
a
decent
brew
but
i
expected
more
malt
flavor
than
what
im
experiencing
here
i
hear
a
lot
of
good
comments
regarding
this
from
others
and
although
im
not
into
hoppy
beers
i
can
do
a
few
of
these
this
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
and
one
which
i
recommend
to
some
of
my
friends
who
shy
away
from
some
of
the
hopped
up
ipas
out
there
deschutes
inversion
stone
ruination
and
dogfish
head
90
minute
to
name
a
few
overall
a
very
good
taken
on
a
american
pale
ale
on
of
the
top
ones
out
there
for
the
style
nice
hop
bite
that
is
well
balanced
by
bready
malts

pours
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
very
nice
2
finger
dense
off
white
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lasts
some
nice
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
orange
grapefruit
pine
herbal
floral
caramel
pineapple
biscuit
and
light
toast
pretty
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good
balance
but
they
are
a
bit
muted
taste
of
orange
grapefruit
biscuit
pine
caramel
toast
nuttiness
floral
and
herbal
spiciness
good
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
citrus
pine
biscuit
caramel
and
herbal
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
great
hop
flavor
balance
with
malts
and
a
very
nice
robust
amount
of
flavor
for
a
5
beer
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
as
expected
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
great
amount
of
flavor
with
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
extremely
drinkable
and
smooth
my
glass
was
gone
a
bit
too
fast
really
enjoyed
this
overall
average
easy
drinking
pale
ale
regardless
of
your
preference
it
is
definitely
worth
a
taste
o
this
is
what
you
want
a
pale
ale
to
be
very
balanced
malt
and
hop
character
lots
of
flavorful
malt
and
fruity
hops
i
could
see
myself
getting
some
six
packs
of
this
while
i
had
previously
mentioned
that
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
not
an
everytime
beer
i
think
mirror
pond
is
deschutes
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
one
its
reddish
body
isnt
typical
for
an
apa
and
its
got
a
heavy
dose
of
malts
and
a
little
fruitiness
that
work
in
tandem
with
that
initial
hop
push
to
find
a
great
balance
even
my
friends
that
dont
typically
go
for
hops
or
pale
ales
can
get
into
this
one
o
excellent
drinkability
and
a
very
nice
hop
presence
make
this
one
of
the
all
time
best
pale
ales
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
a
dark
blond
think
burnt
orange
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
thats
very
bubbly
frothy
and
just
overall
inviting
i
hope
hell
is
this
soft
when
i
get
there
you
can
smell
the
hops
right
away
some
mild
citrus
fruits
aromas
with
some
wheat
mixed
in
its
got
a
mediumtolight
body
and
is
crisp
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
with
mildly
tangy
kicks
when
it
hits
the
sides
and
back
of
your
mouth
the
hops
are
present
and
very
welcoming
and
like
those
overbearing
motherinlaws
or
grandmas
that
always
say
here
you
go
have
a
little
more
food
youre
too
skinny
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
smooth
the
hops
pick
up
a
little
more
and
theres
a
slight
grapefruit
taste
in
there
too
not
bad
beer
over
all
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
overall
a
great
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
if
distribution
ever
gets
picked
up
around
here
i
will
be
sure
to
secure
a
case
every
month
excellent
easy
going
apa
drink
at
will
o
no
red
chair
but
pretty
tasty
worth
trying
oa
good
apa
not
the
best
but
worth
including
in
a
tasting
of
the
style
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
one
of
my
favorite
pas
from
the
first
time
i
drank
it
i
think
this
will
be
my
go
to
pale
ale
from
here
on
out
if
i
want
a
bottle
of
course
8bit
in
the
can
highly
recommended
beer
deschutes
does
it
again
with
an
outstanding
widely
available
beer
excellent
job
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
i
tend
to
like
mine
with
malt
that
is
a
bit
lighter
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
anyway
i
would
like
have
to
of
seen
more
hop
presence
in
the
palate
but
still
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
apa
deschutes
has
done
their
research
all
in
all
those
who
want
a
more
boldly
hoppy
apa
may
be
disappointed
but
the
mix
of
the
floral
hops
sweet
middle
and
grain
on
the
finish
made
this
a
real
smooth
drinker
that
would
be
wonderful
in
hot
weather
a
great
sessionable
pale
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
pales
fall
short
in
the
area
of
complexity
mirror
pond
brings
to
the
pale
category
a
bright
citrus
smell
and
taste
a
lot
of
pales
seem
to
sacrifice
complexity
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
standard
light
drinkers
sitting
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
beer
begs
for
another
sip
excellent
color
adds
to
the
pleasure
making
this
an
all
around
enjoyable
beer
a
great
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
or
to
take
the
edge
off
a
long
day
this
is
a
classic
perhaps
my
favorite
pale
ale
deschutes
proves
that
they
can
make
really
good
barrel
aged
ales
and
standard
brews
as
well
o
im
currently
staying
at
the
samesun
hostel
in
vancouver
and
this
is
the
only
beer
that
really
has
taken
to
me
so
its
been
my
session
ale
really
enjoyable
and
a
beverage
ive
been
recomending
to
the
crowds
o
a
go
to
quality
tasty
session
brew
not
some
amazing
beer
you
tell
your
children
about
but
a
great
beer
i
tell
my
wife
and
friends
about
o
could
be
a
little
bit
hoppier
but
this
is
a
fairly
balance
apa
definitely
easy
to
drink
with
any
occasion
overallthis
brew
would
taste
great
with
anything
it
also
is
a
great
session
beer
its
the
type
of
pale
ale
you
could
have
on
a
nice
warm
summer
evening
just
after
a
long
hike
or
a
nice
run
let
it
sit
after
pouring
it
into
your
glass
to
warm
up
a
bit
the
tastes
mature
i
will
buy
this
again
cheers
shorthand
drink
this
i
want
to
o
a
very
underwhelming
apa
its
balanced
and
easy
drinking
but
i
would
prefer
the
hops
to
be
a
little
more
forward
right
up
with
sierra
nevada
as
the
classic
american
pale
mirror
pond
has
a
bit
more
malt
and
yeast
character
biscuit
and
caramel
are
firm
against
the
floral
and
citrus
cascades
bitterness
is
even
and
drying
and
keeps
the
drinkability
high
along
with
the
wellcalibrated
carbonation
an
anytime
beer
thats
great
alone
or
paired
with
just
about
any
type
of
food
oa
nice
easy
drinking
pale
ale
this
is
stupidly
drinkable
and
i
imagine
that
it
is
fantastic
with
food
i
would
love
to
drink
this
all
day
but
of
course
i
cant
i
need
a
private
jet
so
i
can
get
regional
beers
whenever
i
feel
like
it
its
very
smooth
very
very
little
hop
bitterness
a
nice
amount
of
honey
caramel
malts
and
fruitiness
from
the
hops
and
then
on
the
back
there
is
a
nice
breadiness
its
very
pleasing
outstandingly
good
interpretation
of
a
pale
ale
after
drinking
lots
of
ipas
stouts
and
other
heavy
beers
this
is
compartively
light
refreshing
and
easy
i
drank
this
with
home
cooked
boiled
live
crawfish
that
were
burn
you
twice
spicy
and
this
one
goes
excellent
with
spicy
i
really
like
it
and
will
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
nothing
groundbreaking
just
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
apa
i
can
see
how
this
beer
will
appeal
to
just
about
any
beer
drinker
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
a
few
of
them
though
tastewise
the
malt
is
still
heavy
and
thick
but
not
a
bad
or
syrupy
way
things
start
off
bready
then
get
piney
then
theres
a
very
nice
finish
of
doughy
yeast
citrus
and
caramel
the
yeast
really
brings
everything
together
and
the
chewy
backend
keeps
things
plenty
interesting
throughout
the
duration
of
the
bomber
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copperishgolden
color
with
an
eggshell
colored
soapy
head
decent
head
retention
with
some
glass
lacing
hints
of
lemon
and
a
raisen
or
two
in
the
bouquet
perhaps
a
raisen
bread
pudding
certainly
nothing
obtrusive
for
the
olfactory
to
experience
nice
mild
flavor
with
lemon
citrus
being
noted
most
easily
at
first
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
mouthfeel
i
wanted
it
to
be
a
little
more
wet
but
after
having
given
the
beer
a
few
pulls
i
realize
that
the
scrubbiness
and
just
the
faintest
dustiness
accentuate
the
flavor
of
the
beer
there
is
more
of
a
bitter
feeling
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
rather
than
a
discernable
flavor
at
the
finish
if
you
will
i
like
it
i
wish
it
was
just
a
fudge
cheaper
though
if
youre
looking
for
hop
stick
to
the
inversion
or
red
chair
but
if
youre
looking
for
malt
this
is
worth
a
try
i
maybe
expected
a
bit
more
from
this
great
brewery
one
of
my
favorites
but
a
good
session
beer
non
the
less
i
can
definatly
see
the
mass
appeal
this
is
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
id
definatly
put
one
back
with
ease
if
offered
overall
this
is
a
beer
ive
grown
to
appreciate
over
time
as
pale
ales
go
its
one
of
my
faves
copper
on
amber
with
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
spotty
lace
smells
sweet
with
malts
of
the
english
engagement
simple
malt
with
tones
of
toffee
and
wood
there
smells
some
fruity
herbal
hops
which
are
understated
and
approachable
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
low
acidity
and
a
nice
flowery
finish
medium
bodied
and
lower
carb
with
a
semi
slick
finish
nice
beer
really
really
drinkable
and
although
its
not
my
favorite
pa
its
among
the
most
frequently
visited
for
me
surprised
i
took
this
long
to
sit
down
and
just
type
this
out
a
great
pale
ale
to
be
had
here
any
hop
head
would
be
pleased
and
if
you
love
cascade
hops
this
is
your
ale
a
great
snapshot
of
what
an
pnw
pale
ale
o
a
very
honest
pale
ale
certainly
one
of
my
favorites
o
a
top
notch
pale
hoppy
and
good
o
a
solid
pale
ale
would
love
to
get
more
of
these
overall
its
very
tasty
stuff
a
good
basic
pale
ale
that
luckily
i
can
now
get
on
a
regular
basis
havent
had
this
one
in
a
long
time
so
decided
it
was
time
to
give
it
another
go
poured
a
nice
dark
golden
with
a
thumb
and
a
half
widths
creamy
head
sweet
bready
citric
piney
a
very
smooth
and
balanced
flavor
a
nice
malt
base
providing
a
nice
sweet
bread
that
gets
paired
with
some
hops
a
very
crisp
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
to
this
another
homerun
by
deschutes
and
so
much
better
than
i
remembered
it
balanced
smooth
and
tasty
a
great
choice
as
a
session
beer
but
just
as
good
a
choice
if
you
just
want
to
take
one
in
for
the
night
and
enjoy
it
but
good
luck
only
drinking
one
overall
a
good
goto
pale
ale
with
a
mild
hop
profile
nothing
stands
out
but
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
nonetheless
overall
this
is
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
pale
ale
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
although
i
am
not
as
fond
of
american
pales
as
much
as
english
pale
or
pub
ales
overall
good
but
not
great
gold
color
small
off
white
head
and
thin
lacing
has
a
very
malty
fruity
aroma
mixed
with
a
well
blend
of
malts
and
hops
creating
a
great
tasting
well
blended
ale
not
too
bitter
very
tasty
nice
and
hoppy
without
being
over
the
top
really
well
balanced
to
me
this
is
about
as
good
as
an
american
pale
ale
gets
quite
similar
to
the
odell
5
barrel
in
a
lot
of
ways
smells
more
malty
than
most
almost
british
style
in
that
regard
but
also
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
smell
and
in
the
flavor
too
flavor
has
a
nice
fruity
hop
profile
but
nothing
aggressive
just
a
nice
balanced
easy
drinking
session
pale
ale
works
will
with
tailgate
style
food
and
is
a
nice
beer
for
that
purpose
i
must
say
this
brewery
has
done
nothing
but
impress
me
i
will
always
buy
their
stuff
because
its
so
unique
and
high
quality
this
is
their
staple
beer
for
good
reason
od
not
too
bad
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
with
nice
balance
o
i
wanted
a
little
more
hops
in
the
pale
ale
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
really
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
much
less
assertive
than
their
ipa
clearly
distinguishing
itself
a
beer
that
could
go
well
with
a
lot
of
dishes
and
be
enjoyed
in
multiples
in
a
sitting
nice
job
deschutes
d
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
nothing
over
powering
but
was
a
good
beer
that
i
will
search
out
again
another
good
one
from
deschutes

overall
impression
this
mirror
pond
in
front
of
me
has
to
be
due
to
an
oldover
due
keg
or
line
problems
i
will
be
reviewing
the
bottle
i
picked
up
from
lukas
liquor
soon
i
surely
cannot
recommend
this
beer
from
what
i
had
to
sit
through
with
this
version
an
english
pale
ale
at
best
oreal
nice
and
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
a
few
of
these
during
warmer
months
overall
solid
american
pale
ale
2
99
for
a
bomber
heck
yes
this
is
a
solid
b
something
that
for
the
price
would
be
an
easy
call
to
pick
up
whenever
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
apa
this
makes
a
nice
counterpoint
to
schlaflys
more
earthy
dank
dryhopped
apa
pretty
solid
pale
although
subtle
drinks
easy
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
have
just
had
so
many
better
offerings
in
the
style
great
apa
refreshing
and
true
to
style
very
nice
brew
from
deschutes
o
so
yesterday
i
reviewed
dales
pale
and
man
are
these
two
beers
on
opposite
ends
dales
is
an
ipalite
and
this
is
an
epaextra
so
balanced
and
tasty
if
dales
pale
is
my
go
to
partybbq
beer
mirror
pond
is
my
chill
evening
bbqanytime
beer
i
can
drink
this
to
relax
any
night
love
deschutes
the
flavor
felt
a
bit
washed
out
but
overall
a
pretty
good
apa
from
deschutes
enjoyed
in
utah
wish
deschutes
made
its
way
in
to
my
place
in
kentucky
overall
i
love
this
beer
my
favorite
apa
to
date
this
will
definitely
become
a
regular
for
me
and
i
highly
recommend
it
poured
a
slightly
hazed
apricot
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
good
dose
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
bready
yeast
as
good
beers
in
the
style
should
be
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bready
malts
with
citrus
and
piney
hops
mild
fruit
tones
lightmedium
body
and
easily
drinkable
o
a
decent
simple
drinkable
pale
ale
overall
wellbalanced
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
would
have
again
for
all
the
nonhopbombs
which
i
love
from
oregon
i
would
put
this
beer
on
a
very
level
playing
field
with
widner
bros
drifter
pale
ale
that
one
has
a
bit
more
bite
to
it
when
it
comes
to
hoppiness
and
thats
about
it
both
are
excellent
and
i
would
recommend
to
any
person
that
likes
the
pale
ale
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
light
yelloworange
color
although
it
might
have
been
the
lighting
at
the
bar
the
color
was
translucent
and
not
too
much
head
off
the
pour
had
a
good
crisp
taste
with
faint
hints
of
a
grainy
blend
the
first
sip
was
very
flavorful
and
the
strong
flavor
lasted
through
the
entirety
of
the
drink
i
strongly
recommend
i
really
like
this
pale
ale
you
can
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
stuff
o
a
very
decent
apa
love
the
malt
texture
and
aroma
will
continue
to
drink
pour
a
clear
copper
color
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
hint
of
pine
sweet
malt
hint
of
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
floral
hops
slight
citrus
hops
hint
of
yeast
and
slight
citrus
pear
overall
good
appearance
aroma
feel
and
body
an
ok
beer
in
my
opinion
but
as
a
lover
of
double
ipas
i
feel
like
im
jaded
against
less
bold
statements
out
of
a
beer
o
overall
great
pale
ale
wish
this
was
a
local
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
deschutes
the
fresh
hop
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
beer
and
another
that
id
pick
up
regularly
but
the
mirror
pond
just
seems
so
accessible
that
it
would
be
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
just
always
be
in
the
fridge
nice
job
on
this
one
conclusion
i
would
expect
nothing
less
than
a
great
pale
ale
from
a
brewery
with
as
a
good
a
track
record
as
deschutes
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
from
an
outstanding
brewery
overall
this
would
be
a
good
summertime
drinker
for
most
i
think
the
predominance
of
bitter
grapefruit
in
the
taste
without
much
to
offset
it
turns
me
off
a
bit
but
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
not
remarkable
but
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
overall
not
terribly
intriguing
to
taste
although
not
dull
or
boring
either
very
good
tasting
great
beer
thanks
o
very
drinkable
apa
that
is
sessionable
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
have
another
on
tap
in
sf
really
clean
tasting
slightly
fruity
pale
ale
not
overpowering
at
all
just
pure
spring
water
with
wholesome
beer
goodness
hopefully
this
is
as
good
in
a
bottle
and
hopefully
it
will
make
its
way
to
this
side
of
the
mississippi
soon
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
pale
ale
extremely
sessionable
and
tasty
without
being
over
the
top
at
all
another
deschutes
brew
that
has
impressed
me
greatly
d
finding
more
eloquent
descriptions
for
a
relatively
bland
pale
ale
is
pretty
difficult
a
disappointment
oh
well
masterful
brewing
just
not
a
huge
fan
anymore
of
cascade
proly
not
many
others
who
could
make
this
taste
as
good
poured
with
a
lovely
foamy
frothy
fluffy
large
off
white
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
pleasing
clear
honey
amber
aroma
is
malt
cascade
cereal
fresh
all
grain
bread
dough
flavors
about
the
same
with
the
sweet
grains
bold
hops
and
a
little
carbonic
tang
framing
the
picture
body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
and
as
much
as
im
no
longer
a
fan
of
cascade
it
leaves
pleasant
memories
ill
have
another
gotdamit
glad
to
have
finally
tried
it
will
certainly
have
it
again
o
pleasant
taste
look
and
smell
kinda
seems
like
a
springearly
summer
beer
overall
one
of
the
most
easily
likeable
beers
ive
encountered
simple
drinkable
refreshing
and
delicious
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
have
gone
back
to
buy
more
its
balanced
well
tastes
great
and
goes
down
good
burps
taste
yummy
too
this
is
definately
one
to
try
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
now
o
an
underperforming
brew
last
time
i
had
this
one
it
blew
me
away
this
time
the
brewbatch
has
let
me
down
come
on
deschutes
dont
let
me
down
pretty
superb
pale
ale
and
i
got
it
at
safeway
of
all
places
not
that
id
recommend
it
at
all
for
a
beer
store
or
grocery
store
for
that
matter
but
it
was
the
only
place
thats
open
past
9pm
and
has
beer
it
has
one
of
the
best
heads
ive
seen
for
this
style
it
smells
wonderfully
of
hops
with
floral
and
citrus
qualities
the
taste
is
even
somewhat
perfumey
with
some
lemon
zest
flavors
and
of
course
the
pale
malt
a
very
solid
pale
ale
indeed
so
pleasant
it
feels
like
it
should
be
had
a
a
tea
party
id
definitely
drink
this
midday
o
fine
example
of
pale
ale
in
fact
bjcp
list
this
as
a
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
or
would
they
o
very
smooth
easy
drinking
wellbalanced
and
refreshing
great
beer
o
this
beer
was
good
and
refreshing
i
usually
like
a
little
more
hoppiness
in
my
pale
ales
but
this
beer
is
balanced
well
so
it
makes
for
an
easy
drinker
o
very
represenative
of
the
style
i
think
they
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
i
would
recommend
to
avid
p
a
drinkers
as
well
as
newbies
and
i
know
they
would
both
be
satisfied
you
know
i
really
liked
the
character
of
this
for
a
pale
ale
having
a
well
balanced
and
accessible
hop
profile
but
the
overall
thickness
of
it
which
seemed
totally
unrelated
to
the
body
did
hold
the
drinkability
of
this
back
some
im
guessing
that
its
the
englishstyle
yeast
strain
that
deschutes
uses
which
has
never
really
been
a
problem
for
me
until
this
beer
i
think
that
a
16
oz
pint
of
this
was
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
of
this
beer
during
this
sitting
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
as
it
is
easy
to
drink
perfectly
carbonated
well
balanced
and
very
aromatic
good
all
around
this
is
a
very
solid
apa
overall
ive
always
liked
this
beer
and
it
is
a
solid
reference
point
as
well
as
ambassador
of
a
similar
style
maybe
not
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
an
apa
i
would
see
it
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
bready
malt
and
some
subdued
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
subdued
herbalfloral
hops
and
some
slight
grape
juice
flavors
minor
hop
bitterness
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
this
beer
has
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
very
easy
to
drink
and
with
the
5
abv
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
golden
straw
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
and
left
some
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
hops
and
toasted
malts
flavors
of
citrus
hops
and
cereallike
malt
are
well
balanced
medium
bodied
with
enough
effervescence
to
leave
a
fizzy
sensation
on
the
tongue
nice
citrus
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
balanced
beer
that
leans
toward
the
hoppy
side
pours
a
clear
pale
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is

is

and
has
tastes
of

and
finished
with
a
fruit
salad
dry
semi
bitterness
and
overall
its
alright
and
sessionable
but
probably
would
not
buy
again
cheers
overall
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
ever
made
and
why
i
love
deschutes
so
much
solid
apa
but
not
in
my
top
five
great
for
warm
weather
drink
id
come
back
to
this
any
time
if
it
were
available
in
socal
on
tap
treads
a
line
not
heavily
traveled
by
the
pale
ale
specialists
these
days
that
is
one
of
adequately
balanced
with
malts
without
syrupy
sweetness
heads
in
the
direction
of
a
more
elegant
version
of
sierra
nevada
pa
with
better
malting
and
more
attractive
for
multiple
glasses
at
a
time
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
drinkable
yet
complex
exactly
what
a
good
apa
should
be
i
loved
the
fruity
hops
its
too
bad
this
isnt
more
common
up
here
in
minnesota
i
would
take
this
over
sierra
nevada
any
day
this
is
a
good
pale
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
and
is
easily
drank
match
this
one
with
a
slice
of
pizza
or
hamburger
the
quintessence
of
a
northwestern
brewpub
beer
id
never
turn
one
down
id
even
buy
it
again
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
pale
ale
thanks
to
mnbeerhunter
for
sending
me
a
bomber
of
mirror
pond
in
the
n00b
5
bif
this
beer
is
a
bright
amber
with
a
nice
tuft
of
foam
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
beer
smells
like
candied
oranges
and
graham
crackers
the
beer
tastes
wonderful
with
great
citrus
zip
the
malts
are
chewy
and
a
little
dough
like
a
good
pizza
crust
there
are
nice
herbal
and
citrus
hops
percolating
through
this
beer
wonderful
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
apa
ive
ever
had
o
very
nice
drinkable
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
an
enjoyable
beer
drink
overall
one
of
the
better
apas
on
the
malty
side
ill
come
back
to
this
one
when
its
available
mirror
pond
pours
an
ever
so
hazy
orange
hued
gold
with
a
nice
slightly
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
linger
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
nice
biscuity
bready
notes
and
a
pleasant
herbal
hoppiness
the
flavor
is
malty
upfront
with
a
sudden
sharp
citrusy
hop
flavor
more
bready
malt
and
some
nice
caramel
and
toffee
pop
up
in
the
finish
the
moderate
bitterness
is
sharpened
by
the
carbonation
in
the
finish
with
just
a
bit
of
lingering
resin
o
it
is
a
very
good
apa
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
have
to
enjoy
again
some
time
no
complaints
deschutes
never
disappoints
mirror
pond
pale
ale
is
a
rusty
orange
colored
brew
sporting
a
mediumsized
white
bubbly
head
the
scent
is
a
light
citrus
hop
scent
with
a
sweet
caramel
follow
through
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
light
caramelized
malt
flavor
but
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
apricots
orange
peel
fairly
floral
pretty
fruity
overall
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
northweststyle
pale
ale
generous
with
the
hops
and
always
refreshing
overallreasonable
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
as
for
flavor
pretty
average
on
the
other
hand
the
aroma
and
flavor
dropped
off
quite
a
bit
by
the
bottom
of
the
growler
o
excellent
pale
ale
good
summertime
and
really
good
anytime
beer
while
this
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
character
its
nothing
too
strong
so
as
to
be
niche
its
more
likely
to
turn
the
average
beer
drinker
onto
better
beer
than
it
is
to
turn
them
away
from
it
which
is
exactly
what
deschutes
does
that
fact
coupled
with
other
reliable
flagship
brands
like
this
makes
that
brewery
truly
deserving
of
all
the
praise
that
comes
its
way
o
what
can
i
say
deschutes
just
doesnt
disappoint
a
very
refreshing
beer
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
their
red
chair
nwpa
blows
this
one
away
the
red
chair
had
a
lot
more
hops
whereas
this
one
had
a
lot
of
malts
and
a
twinge
of
mustiness
to
it
if
i
saw
both
on
the
shelf
id
suggest
going
with
red
chair
though
this
is
worth
a
shot
once
easy
drinking
enjoyable
pale
ale
not
the
best
out
there
but
tasty
none
the
less
surprisingly
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
spoton
for
me
i
really
just
cant
find
anything
negative
about
this
beer
its
not
setting
the
world
on
fire
but
its
a
very
solid
brew
from
deschutes
i
cant
wait
until
they
have
the
capacity
to
come
to
pennsylvania
fulltime
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
healthy
off
white
creamy
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
nice
flowery
yeast
hop
with
caramel
malt
ideas
the
flavor
brings
more
yeasty
sweet
caramel
with
a
decided
up
front
bite
of
grassy
hops
theres
a
suggestion
of
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
dry
citrus
even
a
little
vegetable
edge
it
mellows
as
it
drops
down
the
gullet
and
is
quite
drinkable
though
id
prefer
less
grass
as
usual
mediumlight
body
with
a
sparkling
clean
feel
o
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
balanced
pale
ales
ive
had
it
definitely
shares
a
lot
of
qualities
of
amber
and
brown
ales
it
does
seem
a
little
too
roastednutty
for
a
pale
but
i
like
it
if
i
had
local
access
to
this
id
likely
buy
it
regularly
o
very
highly
recommended
beer
one
of
the
finest
pale
ales
in
america
definitely
on
the
west
coast
oregon
and
especially
bend
should
be
proud
of
this
one
pick
one
up
if
you
havent
yet
it
is
easy
to
get
for
me
reasonalby
priced
and
a
tasty
beer
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
go
to
beers
for
a
quick
one
after
work
overall
exceeds
my
expectations
and
i
am
a
big
fan
now
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
would
be
one
happy
camper
pours
a
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
and
has
a
surprising
hoppy
evergreen
overtone
malty
hoppy
flavor
is
somewhat
fruity
with
a
touch
of
fruit
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
fizzy
sassy
texture
leaves
behind
a
nice
tingle
o
nice
pale
for
sure
im
glad
philly
got
this
in
for
beer
week
this
is
a
pale
ale
loaded
with
flavor
and
reasonably
heavy
on
the
hops
quite
nice
d
this
one
is
an
extremely
sessionable
american
pale
ale
if
ever
there
was
one
slight
more
assertive
than
most
but
nothing
overpowering
simple
straight
forward
very
effective
medium
bodied
but
a
bit
fuller
than
expected
with
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
subtle
floral
hop
presence
up
front
with
faint
dryness
only
slightly
bitter
with
kind
of
a
weaker
hop
presence
than
anticipated
sweetness
underneath
with
pale
malt
grass
straw
apple
and
pear
slight
dry
finish
very
easy
to
drink
o
id
definitely
get
it
again
a
very
good
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
do
refreshing
and
smooth
a
pretty
classic
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
good
stuff
o
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
crisp
clean
and
delicious
i
seem
to
have
enjoyed
everything
from
this
brewery
o
nice
light
and
tasty
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
mild
apa
and
imo
is
more
suited
to
the
style
i
have
had
some
very
hoppy
apas
that
while
delicious
are
almost
indistinguishable
from
ipas
this
turns
the
hops
down
a
little
and
makes
it
into
a
nice
balanced
apa
all
around
good
but
nothing
outstanding
in
my
opinion
a
good
overall
apa
excellent
finish
with
good
flavors
hops
provided
flavor
but
didnt
kick
up
bitterness
until
the
last
second
a
great
nw
apa
even
better
paired
with
food
e
g
a
high
quality
burger
readily
overlooked
by
their
porters
and
stouts
but
deschutes
knows
how
to
brew
a
wide
variety
of
styles
with
distinction
and
craftsmanship
o
a
very
tasty
brew
goes
great
with
food
a
great
session
choice
o
very
drinkable
for
prolonged
sessions
with
this
one
not
that
im
rating
it
any
higher
because
of
this
but
the
low
cost
will
have
me
returning
to
this
one
soon
overall
this
is
a
very
good
apa
obviously
not
as
intense
as
an
ipa
maybe
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
the
unwashed
taste
wow
really
smooth
taste
of
hopps
but
not
overpowering
like
some
pale
ales
very
refreshing
while
browsing
through
my
ligour
aisle
at
albertsons
and
taking
way
too
long
to
pick
from
my
usuals
my
impatient
8
year
old
said
dad
pick
something
new
this
was
the
one
and
no
regrets
good
stuff
maynard
overall
excellent
overall
great
tasting
pale
ale
wish
it
had
a
little
more
carbonation
but
thats
a
pretty
minor
complaint
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
light
floral
hops
as
well
as
some
sugar
cookie
not
terribly
complex
but
enjoyable
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
some
sugar
cookies
as
well
as
some
floral
hops
clean
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
light
body
medium
carbonation
o
a
good
interpretion
of
an
american
style
pale
ale
a
very
balanced
simple
american
pale
ale
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
food
nothing
really
stood
out
and
made
me
saywow
but
it
was
a
very
pleasant
experience
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tall
beer
glass
great
orange
hue
with
a
nice
beige
foamy
head
nice
smell
with
a
small
sweet
taste
little
alcoholy
for
a
5
0
mouthful
was
watery
and
a
bit
disappointing
considering
the
color
and
head
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
oh
well
o
classic
northwest
pale
ale
great
balance
between
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
one
of
my
goto
pale
ales
m
d
a
bit
watery
finely
carbonated
refreshing
very
drinkable
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
aroma
especially
is
nice
and
is
a
bit
like
a
potpourri
with
a
sweet
malty
edge
to
it
that
i
enjoyed
otherwise
the
flavor
is
also
good
and
well
blended
i
just
think
that
there
is
something
going
on
with
the
water
to
make
the
hops
have
that
edge
regardless
i
have
a
6pack
of
this
beer
and
i
am
not
going
to
let
it
go
to
waste
i
assure
you
overall
very
solid
pale
ale
love
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
white
foam
head
bursting
scent
of
fruits
and
malts
tastes
exactly
how
it
smells
with
a
slight
edge
of
hops
a
bit
carbonated
has
a
smooth
but
brisk
mouthfeel
a
pleasure
to
drink
no
alcohol
taste
would
be
great
with
pasta
and
cream
flavored
sauces
or
fish
just
a
damn
good
beer
two
fingers
of
straight
ahead
basic
offwhite
to
tan
foam
loosely
constructed
and
infused
throughout
with
larger
bubbles
simmers
down
evenly
you
get
a
sheeting
effect
on
the
glass
sides
at
first
that
just
keeps
gliding
rather
than
break
into
stickier
streaks
somewhat
cloudy
reddish
orange
hued
liquid
consistent
throughout
with
hardly
any
color
loss
at
the
rims
a
few
strands
of
bubbles
here
and
there
settles
into
your
nostrils
snugly
and
confidently
no
great
fanfare
just
multigrain
bread
biscuit
tea
leaf
green
grass
and
pressed
flowers
lowkey
milk
chocolate
to
toffee
accents
a
brush
of
apple
peach
pear
fruit
and
then
a
splash
of
orange
peel
fits
together
nicely
as
a
whole
with
no
one
element
dominating
mediumbodied
similar
userfriendly
and
balanced
knittogether
presentation
little
bit
of
pepper
and
maybe
ginger
spice
or
soy
then
wet
green
hops
and
earth
the
more
you
sip
the
more
the
bread
biscuit
asserts
itself
more
dough
than
raw
grains
its
smooth
enough
already
that
it
does
not
need
the
malts
to
do
too
much
work
in
this
department
hence
the
chocolate
vanilla
and
peanut
brittle
mostly
under
the
radar
nothing
unusual
about
the
carbonation
brings
some
fluff
as
much
as
churn
mixed
white
fruits
moderately
surprising
you
dont
get
more
citrus
but
nothing
unsettling
maybe
a
tick
more
bitter
at
the
end
than
needed
otherwise
delivers
a
compact
clear
message
of
a
brew
which
can
be
consumed
in
good
amounts
o
i
remember
the
hops
being
fresher
brighter
and
most
of
all
stronger
in
this
beer
so
maybe
this
isnt
the
most
fair
review
but
then
again
maybe
since
i
didnt
stop
to
think
enough
to
write
a
review
before
it
was
all
in
my
head
but
even
faded
its
still
a
tasty
beer
and
an
easy
drinker
as
a
fan
of
black
butte
i
was
eager
to
try
this
one
i
brought
it
home
read
reviews
and
realized
it
was
a
light
beer
i
expected
a
heavier
pale
ale
taste
and
was
slightly
disappointed
aside
from
its
super
light
taste
its
not
half
bad
at
first
i
was
turned
off
but
got
the
hang
of
it
and
started
to
welcome
the
flavor
one
thing
that
was
unappealing
was
the
light
body
the
dried
peach
and
bitter
hops
scream
heavy
body
overall
pick
this
one
up
its
not
too
bad
and
not
bad
for
you
looking
forward
to
trying
more
deschutes
brews
stay
thirsty
my
friends
i
was
looking
for
a
snappy
pale
ale
for
this
gloomy
weather
instead
mirror
pond
is
more
of
a
sessionable
amber
very
balanced
but
doesnt
deliver
quite
the
refreshment
or
enough
bitterness
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
dont
like
getting
fooled
o
crisp
nice
would
enjoy
with
a
meal
next
time
a
very
solid
pale
slightly
powdery
yet
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
full
body
this
ale
purports
to
be
more
well
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
than
other
apas
especially
from
the
pacific
northwest
but
this
claim
only
goes
to
show
just
how
overhopped
american
craft
brews
have
become
yet
the
bitterness
is
pleasing
and
mild
enough
that
the
virtues
of
the
cascade
hops
can
be
detected
i
get
a
slightly
nutty
taste
off
of
it
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
slick
with
just
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
tailend
while
drinkability
is
exceptional
both
in
sensation
and
abv
bitterness
cleans
the
palate
a
bit
while
the
5
abv
definitely
makes
this
sessionable
deschutes
puts
out
a
fantastic
yearround
sixer
lineup
of
which
black
butte
and
obsidian
are
probably
my
favorites
but
this
guy
is
well
worth
the
money
as
well
d
impeccable
frankly
this
beer
is
well
balanced
smells
good
tastes
good
and
has
low
alcohol
very
well
done
dr
admittedly
pale
ale
is
my
second
least
favourite
style
that
said
its
a
very
light
moderate
enjoyable
summers
day
brew
and
gets
me
excited
to
try
deschutes
other
offerings
if
i
can
only
get
me
hands
on
that
damned
abyss
it
takes
a
lot
fr
me
to
rate
it
as
high
as
i
am
but
thats
what
beeradvocate
is
about
discovering
and
enjoying
new
beers
to
this
one
now
and
again
a
nice
darker
amber
beer
with
a
good
white
froth
that
settles
down
after
a
few
minutes
a
nice
aroma
that
hints
of
hops
and
grapefruit
smooth
drinking
and
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malts
perhaps
a
little
more
hoppy
than
some
pale
ales
but
if
you
like
a
little
hops
this
is
a
great
fallback
beer
that
can
be
had
cheap
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
d
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
and
also
quite
refreshing
deschutes
brewery
continues
to
impress
with
this
exquisitely
crafted
balanced
and
complex
american
pale
ale
perhaps
not
the
definitive
beer
in
the
category
it
is
certainly
no
lightweight
and
should
serve
as
a
fine
example
of
the
style
for
beer
enthusiasts
drinkability
interesting
glad
i
tried
it
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
another
one
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
from
the
tap
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
some
of
the
best
parts
out
of
the
bottle
verdict
this
is
an
old
standby
for
me
as
it
is
a
darn
good
pale
ale
and
widely
available
in
my
part
of
the
country
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
havent
already
easy
to
drink
decent
alcohol
content
good
session
especially
for
fans
of
the
american
pale
ale
this
is
a
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
willing
to
try
a
american
pale
ale
to
those
that
already
enjoy
and
seek
out
apas
this
label
should
be
a
very
pleasant
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
as
well
almost
grainy
but
at
the
same
time
thin
and
watery
with
an
especially
weak
finish
im
sure
this
is
a
good
beer
fresh
and
i
wish
i
had
noticed
how
far
past
the
best
by
date
it
was
when
i
received
it
lesson
learned
drink
your
pale
ales
fresh
my
first
deschutes
offering
and
im
impressed
nicely
balanced
and
would
be
a
perfect
compliment
to
some
spicy
food
or
hot
wings
d
great
drinker
a
excellant
example
of
the
style
fourthbeer
potential
high
not
bad
at
all
as
an
ipa
fan
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
balance
of
some
bitterness
in
a
slightly
more
subtle
and
sweeter
package
solid
and
drinkable
pale
ale
sessionable
not
top
notch
but
very
pleasant
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
had
a
great
balance
of
flavor
and
is
just
a
bit
more
hops
away
from
hitting
ipa
level
do
besides
the
mouthfeel
misstep
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
i
believe
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
am
quite
enjoying
it
i
like
deschutes
d
smooth
and
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
but
its
nothing
special
worth
a
shot
do
the
intensity
and
weight
of
this
brew
offers
the
opportunity
to
sink
them
one
after
another
without
a
second
thought
and
it
is
within
this
characteristic
that
its
dichotomy
exists
theres
not
really
enough
in
the
glass
to
stimulate
prolonged
interest
or
that
second
thought
yet
it
is
interesting
enough
to
not
bore
you
to
death
consequently
mp
is
best
summed
up
as
worthy
of
attention
just
not
the
center
of
it
a
solid
session
brew
only
d
very
easy
to
drink
expected
given
the
abv
light
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
refreshing
and
sessionable
great
with
a
meal
or
to
quench
thirst
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
and
well
worth
the
money
good
level
of
carbonation
easy
drinker
really
solid
brew
deschutes
does
a
phenomenal
job
with
all
their
lineup
drinkable
yep
but
not
a
favorite
appearance
is
good
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
disappears
within
two
minutes
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
great
ambergolden
color
smell
is
hoppy
citrus
and
floral
notes
are
picked
up
on
the
nose
but
very
vague
in
the
taste
the
hops
are
neutralized
to
some
extent
by
the
sweet
maltyness
i
also
start
to
pick
up
a
taste
of
fruit
i
think
i
get
grapefruit
i
cant
quite
tell
which
taste
is
most
present
it
really
just
blends
nicely
all
together
the
three
tastes
make
for
a
really
nice
beer
the
drinkability
isnt
bad
i
dont
want
to
drink
a
hundred
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
go
down
refreshing
enough
and
ive
had
this
as
a
session
beer
in
the
past
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
here
appearance
is
nothing
too
exciting
but
has
a
nice
amber
hue
foamy
head
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
not
complex
but
a
nice
floral
malt
flavor
similarly
not
complex
but
done
well
pungent
malt
with
woody
and
slightly
sweet
hope
notes
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
i
like
the
boldness
but
would
appreciate
more
complexity
still
a
tasty
beer
d
i
found
this
one
to
be
really
easy
to
drink
i
like
whats
going
on
here
maybe
a
bit
to
carbonated
still
easy
drinking
and
a
good
starter
to
convert
your
freinds
to
craftmicrobrews
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
hoppy
ale
that
goes
down
real
easy
this
is
a
beer
for
you
and
if
you
havent
tried
a
deschutes
beer
you
are
missing
out
perfect
beer
for
a
sunny
afternoon
while
you
sit
in
the
snow
on
the
top
of
your
local
mountain
the
body
is
limited
and
i
think
its
more
because
of
the
dry
finish
this
does
help
bring
the
hops
out
more
in
the
taste
though
co2
is
good
overall
a
good
apa
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
pale
for
a
casual
setting
or
with
a
meal
d
well
balanced
a
drinkable
beer
like
it
i
love
deschutes
d
low
because
of
my
taste
but
it
seems
like
a
well
put
together
beer
my
first
one
went
down
exceedingly
quickly
i
bet
brand
new
fresh
mirror
pond
is
bomb
and
a
rival
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
im
glad
i
know
what
i
was
passing
up
all
those
times
that
i
chose
something
else
d
this
is
great
looking
forward
to
trying
more
deschutes
beers
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
especially
during
the
summer
this
is
an
overly
hopped
beer
which
to
me
is
sometimes
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
hoppy
with
a
grassy
earthy
mouthfeel
a
golden
yellow
color
with
just
the
right
amount
of
head
and
carbonation
and
is
pretty
smooth
if
served
very
chilled
this
beer
loses
its
flavor
the
warmer
it
gets
it
is
very
refreshing
and
is
obviously
made
by
people
who
know
what
theyre
doing
deschutes
usually
tends
to
put
out
a
great
product
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
a
good
ipa
but
not
as
good
as
sn
d
near
perfect
i
suggest
you
drink
this
to
excess
d
as
with
most
pale
ales
this
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
beer
with
great
flavor
i
would
put
this
right
up
there
with
most
great
american
pales
i
had
been
enjoying
so
many
ipas
recently
that
when
i
started
tasting
pales
again
i
forgot
how
great
this
style
is
never
again
d
very
drinkable
especially
if
its
hot
outside
nicely
done
poured
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
very
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
moslty
sweet
with
malts
with
citrus
character
and
subtle
hop
notes
that
a
very
faint
the
taste
was
also
big
on
the
malts
which
makes
the
more
sweet
and
really
no
hops
to
really
speak
of
but
had
citrus
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
maltycitrusy
and
crisp
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
d
this
is
a
beer
that
people
are
usually
glad
to
see
you
show
up
at
a
party
with
since
its
a
little
better
than
the
terrible
stuff
that
is
the
most
common
easy
to
drink
casually
but
nothing
there
for
people
looking
for
something
interesting
wow
is
this
sweet
im
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
love
deschutes
im
just
going
to
endthis
review
and
return
to
watching
star
wars
with
my
3
year
old
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
great
it
is
subtle
and
not
invasive
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
consider
it
sessionable
by
ba
standards
which
makes
it
perfect
to
drink
a
few
of
these
without
getting
too
buzzed
drinkability
is
great
perfect
session
beer
crisp
and
bitter
enough
that
it
never
gets
cloying
overall
a
very
solid
american
pale
ale
from
deschutes
its
expected
to
be
good
and
it
delivers
great
balance
very
very
drinkable
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
would
definitely
drink
more
tasty
overall
a
very
nice
brew
that
drinks
easy
beer
after
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
beer
deserves
high
marks
in
all
areas
especially
in
terms
of
drinkability
tasty
well
constructed
highly
drinkable
and
one
of
the
top
pale
ales
brewed
in
the
us
without
a
doubt
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
pretty
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
some
orange
standing
out
the
flavor
is
nice
and
balances
the
hops
with
just
a
bit
of
malt
but
certainly
not
too
much
good
body
with
a
nice
bitterness
this
drinks
incredibly
well
and
would
certainly
be
a
staple
of
mine
if
deschutes
were
to
ever
make
it
out
east
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
apa
it
had
some
very
nice
hoppiness
to
it
for
the
style
and
also
some
decent
maltiness
to
balance
it
out
some
a
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
beer
for
the
style
overall
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
and
a
bit
watery
with
decent
carbonation
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
is
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
for
tons
of
flavor
in
your
pale
ale
youd
probably
look
elsewhere
nicely
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
when
i
think
of
apa
i
think
of
this
beer
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
and
would
be
a
fine
choice
for
any
occasion
medium
body
a
little
dry
and
chewy
goes
down
easy
but
not
exactly
something
you
go
crazy
over
definitely
a
decent
session
beer
but
theres
better
apas
out
there
very
drinkable
yet
not
highly
distinguishable
might
get
lost
in
the
masses
of
microbrews
out
there
good
sessions
beer
and
good
with
food
great
malthop
balance
combined
with
a
fairly
low
abv
makes
this
quite
drinkable
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
i
have
every
had
def
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
simple
hops
simple
malts
delicious
sets
the
bar
for
apas
period
served
in
a
whiskey
glass
look
brown
color
with
ruby
shades
very
thin
foamy
head
maybe
because
of
the
glass
smell
grass
hops
and
nut
malts
taste
wood
hops
with
a
waterfall
of
cookie
and
nut
malts
with
eart
hops
at
the
end
mouthfeel
woody
high
bitterness
the
body
is
soft
for
the
style
drinkability
i
liked
the
combination
of
wood
with
biscuity
malts
very
good
d
quite
high
the
beer
actually
reminds
me
of
an
esb
its
good
perhaps
a
beer
to
try
and
convert
friends
to
craft
with
i
will
admit
that
id
get
a
bit
bored
with
it
12
ounce
bottle
color
is
a
brightish
orange
tinged
to
amber
ive
got
a
little
bit
of
a
cloudy
appearance
not
sure
if
thats
a
typical
characteristic
of
this
beer
or
if
it
was
maybe
my
choice
of
glass
smallish
head
that
collects
tiny
little
pools
of
foam
minimal
lacing
big
aroma
of
biscuity
malt
hop
aroma
is
also
there
though
not
as
pronounced
as
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
with
a
level
of
bitterness
that
surprises
you
given
the
aroma
is
mostly
that
of
malts
adjusting
to
the
level
of
bitterness
the
malt
opens
up
with
caramel
sweetness
hitting
all
the
right
notes
grapefruit
and
spice
add
hop
character
this
is
quite
a
pleasant
pale
ale
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
its
not
watery
almost
slick
and
very
enjoyable
my
only
complaint
about
the
beer
is
that
its
relatively
standard
for
a
pale
ale
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
still
its
a
solid
although
unspectacular
example
of
the
pale
ale
style
d
a
very
good
session
beer
enjoyable
to
the
last
drop
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
big
on
flavor
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
touches
of
amber
good
cap
of
firm
white
bubbled
good
retention
and
moderate
sticky
lacing
scent
is
a
great
combination
of
pacific
hops
good
pine
and
grapefruit
balane
taste
brings
the
delicious
hop
profile
from
the
scent
but
adds
a
nice
touch
of
mango
good
light
crackery
malt
backbone
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
perfect
carbonation
level
a
very
nice
apa
with
better
hop
qualities
than
some
ipas
d
very
drinkable
excellent
hop
flavor
and
malt
complex
with
the
lighter
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
examples
of
an
american
pale
ale
d
i
have
a
friend
who
i
once
heard
put
this
on
a
pedestal
by
saying
that
mirror
pond
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
on
the
market
im
not
going
to
argue
the
best
by
date
was
a
week
awway
has
i
remebered
i
could
defeintly
tell
that
most
of
the
hops
have
faded
still
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
with
some
decent
hop
flavors
some
citrus
but
not
much
still
a
well
crafted
beer
o
i
was
expecting
a
solid
flagship
style
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
clear
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
had
great
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
plenty
of
citrus
and
floral
hop
aroma
to
start
things
out
balanced
with
some
caramel
malt
this
apa
is
surprisingly
flavored
balanced
coming
from
a
west
coast
brewery
citrus
hops
leads
the
way
but
is
quickly
balanced
by
the
sweet
caramel
malt
bitterness
is
moderate
and
seems
to
just
right
for
this
beer
but
it
does
linger
for
a
little
too
long
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
but
is
more
than
enough
to
carry
the
hops
good
carbonation
one
of
the
better
values
to
come
into
our
market
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
regular
in
my
fridge
dability
lacks
malt
sweetness
to
offset
the
hops
a
5
abv
hop
bomb
mdvery
light
in
the
mouth
but
it
has
a
little
bit
of
balls
for
a
pale
ale
there
are
a
number
of
pales
that
i
would
drink
before
this
but
it
would
make
for
a
nice
drink
on
a
warm
day
all
in
all
this
brew
was
not
much
special
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
will
not
hunt
it
down
again
for
sure
solid
highly
drinkable
apa
that
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
inversion
ipa
or
the
hops
in
the
dark
i
tried
but
still
a
solid
effort
from
deschutes
pours
how
youd
expect
then
a
nice
balanced
mix
of
hops
and
malt
i
could
have
done
with
a
bit
more
fruitiness
or
flavor
in
general
but
its
a
fairly
subdued
style
highly
sessionable
awesome
copper
haze
a
nice
head
and
a
balanced
aroma
all
come
with
the
pour
taste
is
very
rich
and
less
refined
than
most
pale
ales
its
much
more
complex
and
thicker
on
the
taste
buds
than
say
a
snpa
i
like
this
beer
it
drinks
heavy
but
says
it
weighs
in
at
5
0
it
has
an
awesome
taste
that
makes
it
stand
out
to
me
as
a
pale
ale
with
alot
of
backbone
cant
go
wrong
with
a
12er
of
this
in
the
cooler
summer
or
winter
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
scent
is
very
fruity
lots
of
citrus
mainly
grapefruit
it
has
a
bit
of
a
funky
scent
to
it
as
well
taste
is
quite
pleasant
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
initially
i
get
citrus
lemons
orange
grapefruit
then
i
get
a
bit
of
tropical
mango
then
it
ends
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
very
nice
i
see
this
beer
everywhere
but
i
never
buy
it
i
regret
that
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thick
for
a
pale
ale
but
i
have
no
complaints
about
that
drinkability
is
very
high
it
seems
like
its
a
bigger
beer
than
it
actually
is
weighing
in
at
only
5
poured
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
12
white
head
smells
hoppy
and
piney
citrusey
hop
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
little
bit
of
malt
too
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
thank
i
expected
but
it
was
good
overall
it
was
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
i
have
had
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
thin
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
freshly
baked
bread
and
a
hint
of
pine
taste
is
light
toffee
up
front
followed
by
a
citrusy
orange
peel
middle
and
a
piny
dry
finish
a
hint
of
soapyness
in
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
nice
low
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
an
excellent
example
of
an
apa
yup
a
pleasantly
hoppy
session
ale
through
and
through
tasty
balanced
and
increasingly
drinkable
due
in
no
small
part
to
its
lingering
dryness
and
look
my
glass
is
now
empty
quelle
surprise
d
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
good
enjoyable
session
beer
but
dont
expect
it
to
be
real
interesting
in
any
one
area
i
would
recommend
it
however
this
beer
was
not
to
my
liking
its
worth
a
try
i
gave
it
a
good
rating
on
taste
because
the
flavor
was
there
but
the
drinkability
factor
was
not
d
a
definite
session
ale
though
there
may
be
some
better
options
available
cheers
d
easy
drinking
thin
but
smooth
and
light
well
balanced
flavours
make
this
a
worthy
beer
and
the
kind
of
pale
ale
that
will
appeal
to
many
tastes
d
very
pleased
with
this
offering
nothing
mind
blowing
but
was
definitely
a
full
flavoured
ale
with
many
admirable
characteristics
i
wish
i
had
access
to
6ers
of
this
in
alberta
as
this
would
be
a
lovely
sessionable
beer
d
after
about
two
of
these
the
malt
becomes
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
a
good
interesting
take
on
the
pale
ale
d
a
great
lawn
mowing
beer
actually
great
for
any
time
you
want
a
very
refreshing
beer
this
brewery
produces
some
liquid
gold
unfortunately
not
this
d
easy
going
down
but
the
lack
of
distinctive
character
gives
this
one
a
thumbs
down
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
good
for
a
session

a
solid
inch
of
head
that
slowly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
fresh
hops
on
the
nose
combine
with
a
distinctly
sweet
malt
to
provide
a
great
aroma
i
get
pineapple
and
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
well
rounded
the
hops
and
malt
strike
a
nice
balance
so
that
you
seem
to
taste
both
equally
bitter
fresh
hops
dance
on
your
tongue
and
the
malt
provides
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
this
one
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
carbonation
might
be
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
me
but
not
by
much
the
finish
leaves
you
with
only
a
slight
hop
resin
and
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness

is
overall
pretty
clean

a

it

is

of
this

noticable
lacing
retention
is

but
this
just
barely
hazy
apa
looks
inviting
it
has
a
very
mild
almost
muted
hop
aroma
but
it
does
carry
some
nice
caramel
sweetness
on
the
aroma
almost
has
a
barleywine
esque
matly
aroma
but
its
very
faint
tastes
on
point
with
the
style
not
over
hopped

over
malted

does

of

have
been
from

and
their
little
brewery

with
deschutes
its
almost
as
if
their
terroir
shows
in
some
of
their
brews
mirror
pond
is
a
pale
ale
ive
loved
for
decades
it
never
gets
old
also
this
is
one
that
needs
to
be
fresh
for
the
full
effect
i
have
bad
visions
of
some
esoteric
brew
from
oregon
sitting
on
shelves
for
months
in
new
jersey
or
georgia
and
then
getting
picked
up
by
beer
lovers
makes
my
head
hurt
dit
is
pretty
drinkable
but
i
will
probably
not
buy
any
more
than
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
a
turn
off
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
and
a
tad
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
light
made
up
mostly
of
bready
malts
and
earthy
hoppiness
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
but
the
hops
are
virtually
non
existent
this
would
be
fine
if
the
malt
profile
was
a
bit
cleaner
but
there
is
some
mustiness
that
holds
it
back
from
really
being
an
easy
drinker
bitter
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
perhaps
to
have
with
a
burger
and
fries
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
medium
body
smooth
with
lively
soft
carbonation
which
makes
it
really
refreshing
overall
a
very
decent
pale
ale
built
for
sessioning
really
as
a
fan
of
ipas
and
dipas
its
kind
of
hard
for
me
to
rave
about
a
pale
ale
in
quite
the
same
way
as
i
would
something
more
inyourfacemuch
less
engage
in
the
same
level
of
detailed
tasting
forensicsbut
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
drinkability
excellent
excellent
beer
i
need
more
deschutes
in
my
life
flavors
are
simple
and
great
its
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
the
5
abv
makes
it
more
than
manageable
this
is
an
allday
allsummer
beer
i
love
this
beer
incredible
taste
not
a
huge
head
on
it
but
i
really
love
this
beer
for
an
american
pale
ale
this
beer
is
amazing
incredibly
refreshing
good
color
good
smelltaste
good
alcohol
level
great
body
overall
very
very
good
i
have
no
improvements
to
make
you
can
find
this
at
whole
foods
which
makes
it
even
better
the
taste
was
mainly
hops
the
same
variety
as
the
smell
but
again
mostly
hops
a
dry
bitterness
with
a
hint
or
two
of
malt
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
they
havent
tried
to
over
hop
this
beer
it
sits
nicely
below
the
ipa
levels
and
although
it
leans
towards
being
that
style
theyve
resisited
to
go
that
far
good
poured
a
golden
dark
amber
with
carbonation
evident
2finger
head
quickly
settled
to
a
coating
which
remained
throughout
nose
is
underwhelming
citrus
floral
and
butterscotch
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
was
a
little
sticky
taste
was
woody
sweetness
of
some
citrus
particularly
lemon
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
although
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
fresh
bottle
nothing
really
stood
out
here
for
me
it
almost
tasted
more
like
a
lager
at
5
this
should
be
quite
sessionable
but
i
will
pass
i
really
liked
this
brew
and
the
bottle
when
way
to
fast
for
me
i
would
gladly
by
more
of
this
brew
if
i
could
body
is
perhaps
fuller
than
average
for
an
american
pale
ale
but
not
out
of
line
soft
carb
not
sticky
extremely
drinkable
ill
have
this
any
time
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
quite
drinkable
session
pale
for
sure
i
guess
this
one
in
my
opinion
basically
compares
to
sn
pale
ale
but
with
less
of
the
roasted
malt
and
bittering
hop
flavor
profile
possible
more
of
a
mellow
wheat
beer
presence
in
the
hops
here
which
make
it
more
preferable
to
girls
ill
experiment
on
that
and
get
back
to
you
d
a
very
interesting
and
unique
west
coast
pale
ale
quite
different
from
snpa
with
the
esters
playing
a
much
larger
role
easily
sessionable
entire
bomber
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
yep
thats
right
lovely
golden
orange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
fell
to
a
lasting
cap
spotty
sheets
of
lacing
looks
great
good
hoppy
aroma
here
but
not
overpowering
in
anyway
less
grapefruit
than
i
was
suspecting
cut
some
citrus
notes
are
there
with
a
lightly
malty
component
in
the
background
good
balance
on
this
pale
ale
tastes
more
like
an
english
style
but
the
american
citruslike
hops
do
show
up
on
the
clean
bitter
finish
malts
are
very
mellow
not
much
sweetness
and
pretty
well
balanced
carbonation
is
just
about
perfect
for
this
lighter
bodied
brew
easy
drinkin
beer
light
bitterness
made
this
bomber
go
quickly
great
session
brew
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
easy
to
session
due
to
the
lower
abv
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
this
is
a
solid
entry
in
the
very
crowded
america
pale
ale
category
i
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
due
to
the
low
cost
and
great
flavors
d
fairly
high
i
like
this
beer
and
itd
be
something
i
would
buy
frequently
if
it
got
shipped
to
the
east
coast
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
am
pale
ales
i
can
remember
having
d
very
easy
to
drink
all
around
very
balanced
and
pleasant
overall
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
i
expected
more
hops
way
too
much
pale
malt
here
all
of
this
combines
for
a
beer
that
isnt
too
drinkable
when
a
normal
pale
ale
should
be
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
in
the
flavor
area
the
bottle
is
about
six
months
old
so
maybe
i
can
find
this
fresh
and
amend
my
review
easily
the
least
impressive
deschutes
beer
i
have
yet
had
its
a
very
basic
pale
ale
if
overly
bitter
for
the
style
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
universe
proves
theyre
mortal
by
brewing
a
merely
good
beer
like
mirror
pond
i
have
lost
no
faith
in
them
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
initial
notes
of
soft
lemony
hops
that
balance
nicely
with
a
strong
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
backbone
clean
finish
leaves
only
a
traces
of
hop
bitterness
doesnt
make
as
strong
of
an
impression
as
some
apas
but
very
nicely
done
drinkability
the
cask
pour
really
puts
the
beer
on
a
level
playing
field
and
lets
it
shine
amazing
pale
for
something
so
readily
accessible
drinkability
is
great
this
would
be
an
awesome
session
pale
ale
mirror
pond
pale
ale
pours
a
good
two
fingers
of
loose
rocky
foam
over
a
clear
orange
brew
carbonation
is
brisk
and
steady
the
nose
is
fruity
marmalade
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
and
spicy
medicinal
hops
the
flavor
is
bready
malts
with
notes
of
lemon
and
a
little
mild
herbal
hops
off
the
back
mouthfeel
is
light
and
round
smooth
and
slightly
dry
that
a
bit
surprising
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
assertive
west
coast
brewing
practices
being
what
they
are
altogether
a
pleasant
decently
crafted
offering
in
a
very
very
broad
field
of
similar
ales
if
they
are
your
local
brewery
by
all
means
support
them
the
fresh
stuff
deserves
your
loyalty
md
medium
body
smooth
feeling
over
the
tongue
carbonation
is
a
touch
on
the
higher
side
okay
drinkability
d
very
nice
great
for
a
spring
afternoon
fullflavored
but
not
even
slightly
overbearing
d
all
day
long
had
to
raise
the
ratings
a
bit
from
my
previous
review
nice
drinkability
but
two
or
three
would
be
enough
a
pretty
unique
apa
its
good
and
interesting
i
would
have
it
again
and
at
the
2
99
price
point
for
a
bomber
a
good
deal
highly
drinkable
i
prepped
myself
for
a
binge
with
a
couple
glasses
of
water
and
went
to
bed
eight
hours
later
for
a
good
nights
sleep
i
recall
walking
to
bed
and
locking
the
doors
and
thats
about
it
beer
is
sweet
and
medium
to
light
in
body
there
is
some
bitterness
at
the
back
and
well
balanced
some
carbonation
on
the
palate
its
pretty
good
its
simple
and
tasty
i
like
it
slick
mouth
feel
mellow
amalgam
of
the
grapefruitwoodbitteringsweet
malts
of
the
pac
nw
apa
nicely
executed
mellow
and
non
aggressive
with
full
flavor
and
satisfying
character
a
standard
for
the
style
drefreshing
and
quite
tasty
this
one
is
perfect
for
warming
weather
that
comes
with
spring
in
minnesota
not
much
better
than
sipping
a
mirror
pond
next
to
a
mountain
lake
in
southern
oregon
great
drinkability
enjoy
edit
this
beer
continues
to
go
downhill
deschutes
either
expanded
too
far
or
something
because
we
just
dont
get
the
same
fresh
awesome
mirror
pond
as
it
used
to
be
the
flavor
is
also
not
real
strong
and
matches
the
aroma
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
is
still
solid
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
session
beer
deschutes
is
in
minnesota
so
i
picked
up
a
few
to
try
mirror
pond
is
first
a
little
less
hop
forward
than
i
was
expecting
and
not
a
lot
going
on
with
the
aroma
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
ill
stay
local
with
summit
for
a
regular
pale
ale
clear

abundant
fresh
lemon

aroma
with
a
slight
background
of
caramel
malts
quite
the
nice
aroma
fresh
citrusy
flavor
too
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
again
id
say
more
of
a
lemon
citrus
aspect
than
the
expected
grapefruit
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
obviously
fresh
and
very
agreeable
with
my
buds
carbonation
level
is
pretty
high
and
this
is
quite
quenching
would
lend
itself
very
nicely
to
some
spicy
thai
or
vietnamese
dishes
drinkability
this
is
a
good
apa
overall
with
slightly
more
rounded
edges
its
got
a
noticeable
sweetness
lacks
the
cut
of
citrus
but
retains
good
presence
of
both
its
malt
and
hop
flavors
i
think
this
is
solid
within
the
context
of
the
style
though
overall
i
prefer
less
hop
in
my
beer
d
this
beer
is
excellent

and

a
lot
like

lager
to
me

has
a
woody

taste
in
the
back

the
mouth
sweet
in
the
beginning
even
a
bit
fruity
like
fresh

very
crisp
and
light
the
flavor
does
not
linger
very
long

a
whole

of

so
smooth

down
fast
i
also
bought

both
2

what
a
buy
my
first
from
deschutes
very
good
beer
especially
with
the
price
point
of
3bomber
around
here
this
might
become
a
nice
goto
beer
especially
for
those
unexcited
by
beer
geek
chic
i
can
see
myself
having
a
few
mirror
ponds
this
summer
as
long
as
they
keep
coming
in
fresh
from
out
west
welcome
to
minnesota
deschutes
a
very
refreshing
yet
complex
pale
ale
suitable
for
a
warm
spring
evening
outside
thank
you
deschutes
for
coming
to
mn
superb
on
drinkability
extremely
wellrounded
and
quite
tasty
flavor
is
light
crisp
extremely
drinkable
heavy
yeast
flavor
theres
a
very
slight
2nd
wave
of
minimal
hops
that
dissapears
faster
than
it
hits
having
some
issues
picking
out
any
perticular
flavors
i
would
have
to
lean
torwards
a
citrus
but
that
doesnt
really
help
regardless
a
solid
pale
ale
d
this
was
a
more
malt
forward
apa
but
still
very
balanced
with
floral
hop
in
the
smell
and
citrus
notes
in
the
flavor
very
very
good
extremely
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
6pack
of
this
brew
and
i
think
id
buy
this
one
again
sometime
i
recommend
it
cheers
i
probably
would
not
order
this
one
again
because
there
are
so
many
others
i
prefer
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
apas
i
have
had
flavors
are
complex
but
very
tolerable
for
just
about
any
palate
its
good
to
see
these
guys
finally
made
it
to
minnesota
d
an
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
but
nothing
outstanding
compared
to
some
of
the
other
pale
ales
out
there
overall
its
a
classic
tastes
great
and
goes
down
easy
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
that
really
opened
my
eyes
when
i
moved
to
the
northwest
and
its
still
a
solid
staple
of
mine
impression
i
would
buy
out
my
store
of
these
it
is
absolutely
delicious
but
sadly
deschutes
doesnt
ship
here
this
is
a
must
drink
a
great
sessionable
beer
and
a
well
made
apa
my
only
problem
is
with
the
aggressive
carbonation
wonderful
classic
example
of
the
style
a
dead
ringer
great
looking
golden
brew
kettle
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
highly
refreshing
cascade
hop
aroma
nothing
overpowering
to
dull
your
senses
just
enough
to
remind
you
its
american
sweet
caramel
malts
are
enjoyed
in
harmony
with
the
great
hoppy
flavor
terrific
pale
ale
and
highly
sessionable
more
please
notes
very
similar
to
the
bottled
version
with
a
fresher
quality
and
better
mouthfeel
as
it
holds
the
texture
much
better
remains
a
good
and
reliable
pale
ale
drinkability
this
beer
is
much
closer
to
an
ipa
than
a
standard
apa
which
makes
me
wonder
what
deschutes
ipa
and
dipa
are
like
solid
beer
nonetheless
the
body
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
the
feel
was
very
slick
with
lively
carbonation
dry
after
the
slickness
in
the
mouth
it
was
easy
to
take
another
sip
for
a
pale
ale
this
one
was
pretty
strong
and
i
tasted
quite
a
bit
of
hops
im
not
used
to
having
a
pale
ale
that
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
again
i
purchased
this
one
at
a
walmart
for
only
6
and
well
worth
it
to
i
figured
this
beer
to
be
a
lot
more
for
the
price
the
drinkability
was
great
being
able
to
enjoy
them
for
the
night
but
not
getting
too
carried
away
with
myself
i
could
classify
this
as
better
than
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorite
beers
would
love
to
get
some
more
of
this
and
the
price
is
too
good
to
pass
up
this
is
one
of
the
first
pale
ales
that
i
tried
and
loved
from
the
instant
i
caught
that
great
hoppy
aroma
i
have
since
appreciated
hoppier
brews
but
i
enjoyed
this
in
the
beginning
because
there
was
more
to
it
than
hop
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
little
lace
left
behind
the
smell
isnt
too
strong
i
could
probably
drink
multiple
pints
because
it
always
leaves
me
wanting
another
mouth
feel
is
good
but
not
much
linger
on
this
one
i
would
suggest
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
classy
pale
ale
bottom
line
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
deschutes
i
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
whenever
i
am
selecting
beers
but
this
one
just
seems
to
have
missed
the
mark
i
prefer
the
red
chair
nwpa
to
mirror
pond
drinkability
there
are
lots
of
good
flavours
here
but
the
slightly
diluted
feel
spoils
it
pleasant
enough
but
im
glad
they
were
free
there
are
much
more
rewarding
pale
ales
out
there
to
enjoy
overall
this
beer
is
dry
yet
refreshing
the
brew
remains
bubbly
and
full
of
flavor
through
to
the
end
i
dont
know
what
the
mirror
pond
in
oregon
looks
like
but
i
believe
i
know
what
that
sensation
tastes
like
after
having
this
brew
if
this
apa
has
hops
in
it
im
hardpressed
to
find
them
i
just
cant
get
past
the
malt
i
know
there
are
others
who
prefer
the
balanced
english
pale
ale
to
the
west
coastsytle
hop
forward
style
but
im
not
one
of
them
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
kind
of
boring
but
easy
to
drink
drinkability
overall
a
fairly
typical
example
of
an
apa
quite
good
but
not
worth
seeking
out
with
all
of
the
other
choices
out
there
a
tasty
pale
ale
well
balanced
worth
a
try
for
the
price
dechutes
does
it
right
with
most
beers
recommended
overall
a
quality
choice
d
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
come
across
aggressively
hopped
while
remaining
semisweet
worth
a
try
great
beer
to
accompany
a
burger
but
also
great
on
its
own
this
was
the
first
sixer
from
deschutes
that
i
bought
from
a
supermarket
where
some
fool
didnt
try
to
be
slick
and
mix
it
with
a
bottle
or
two
of
obsidian
or
black
butte
but
somehow
that
phenomenon
is
actually
quite
pleasing
whenever
people
try
to
pull
that
ive
had
bottles
of
this
beer
in
sixers
when
trying
to
purchase
black
butte
where
it
provided
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
alone
it
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
extra
bonus
love
the
packaging
i
recently
picked
up
some
mirror
pond
for
a
special
occasion
party
in
which
many
of
the
guests
had
unrefined
beer
palettes
and
it
was
like
seeing
an
old
friend
again
after
many
years
apart
pours
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
piney
almost
grapefruit
hop
nose
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
favor
is
mild
grapefruit
hops
with
hints
of
sweetness
12oz
bottle
gift
from
portland
or
mirror
pond
was
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
early
on
and
while
the
competitions
gotten
pretty
stiff
i
still
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
ale
its
low
abv
fruity
flavor
and
crisp
feel
make
it
good
for
social
occasions
i
love
sierra
had
it
specifically
at
my
wedding
only
with
the
mighty
pilsner
urquell
but
this
beer
10
years
later
is
my
new
pale
ale
the
malt
balance
with
the
subtle
hops
works
for
me
is
it
my
age
maybe
but
i
love
this
beer
its
better
than
the
always
picked
up
flagship
porter
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
they
make
im
a
fan
of
obsidian
and
black
butte
by
the
same
brewery
this
isnt
the
kickintheface
hop
bomb
some
people
want
but
its
got
a
lot
of
character
is
perfectly
balanced
and
its
clear
a
lot
of
thought
and
experimentation
went
into
making
this
beer
f
finishes
very
clean
and
crisp
touch
of
a
bitter
hop
bite
but
its
not
too
much
light
and
crisp
clears
your
palate
very
well
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
very
nice
tasting
ale
and
very
clean
and
crisp
nice
crystal
malt
and
good
cascade
hops
another
winner
from
deschutes
great
apa
i
have
had
a
ton
of
this
stuff
mostly
before
i
appreciated
beer
before
it
just
seemed
really
bitter
to
me
but
now
that
i
have
really
gotten
into
beer
i
revisited
it
and
i
really
enjoy
it
m
d

this

to

put
this
next

overall
impression
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
sessionable
apa
look
no
further
what
a
pleasant
experience
to
drink
this
beer
the
first
taste
was
quite
appealing
good
mouthfeel
great
taste
easy
to
keep
drinking
enjoyable
by
itself
but
it
goes
well
with
poultry
dishes
especially
tried
some
of
their
other
beers
too
very
good
although
not
necessarily
my
preference
of
style
this
ones
a
winner
though
d
well
balanced
and
not
overly
bitter
yum
d
extremely
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
i
could
kick
these
back
all
night
this
is
on
my
list
as
something
i
would
buy
again
but
not
seek
out
this
is
not
a
hop
bomb
by
any
means
so
some
will
probably
call
this
a
weak
version
of
a
pale
ale
personally
i
think
it
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
balanced
tasty
and
infinitely
drinkable
had
this
beer
again
and
would
agree
with
the
above
not
really
a
stand
out
color
was
a
light
copper
with
a
light
hop
aroma
flavor
also
had
a
light
hops
nothing
outstanding
but
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
my
least
favorite
from
what
i
have
tried
from
the
brewery
so
far
this
to
me
is
just
an
above
average
apa
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
but
could
not
see
myself
having
anymore
than
two
per
sitting
d
nice
hoppy
flavor
that
is
easily
sessionable
in
a
lot
of
ways
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
but
quite
well
executed
worth
a
try
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
out
of
a
12

bottle
and
into

this
was
a

pale
that
i
could
easily
session
for

easy
to

with
a
good
taste
worth
picking
up
sometime
friends
of
mine
moved
out
to
norcal
and
immediately
raved
about
this
beer
so
i
got
it
in
on
trade
and
its
delightful
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
my
ny
giants
pint
glass
it
had
a
thin
and
easy
aromatic
head
my
initial
response
was
wow
this
tastes
like
i
just
poured
a
long
trail
into
a
sierra
nevada
and
it
really
is
right
in
between
the
two
it
looks
great
with
a
dark
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
throughout
the
smell
is
light
and
clean
this
beer
is
so
clean
and
smooth
you
can
shower
in
it
if
you
want
too
bad
this
is
my
last
one
i
am
always
up
for
a
trade
for
this
so
if
you
see
this
and
you
got
it
let
me
know
your
style
dusty
malt
up
front
with
some
subtle
fruitiness
solid
hop
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
hop
flavors
hops
are
subtle
but
some
green
herbal
flavors
give
it
a
nice
fresh
finish
dry
balanced
pale
ale
with
a
subtle
pnw
hop

a
classic

not

worth
trying

a
good
option
when

hops
some
grassiness
and
a
touch
of

the

more

perhaps
just
a

not

that
i
finished
quite
quickly
this
6
pack
wont
last
long
at

i
assume
this
is
probably
my

favorite
ale
in
deschutes
very
fine

round
lineup
a
good
beer
and
very
affordable
in
salem
or
tending
towards
the
dry
side

some
slight
lingering
bitterness

taste
is
similar
with
lightly
toasty
grain
with
a
faint
caramelized
bready
hint
slightly
burnt
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
some
green
leaves
light
sweetness
and
balancing

with
grapefruit
orange
leaf
its
good
and
drinkable
although
its
character
is
a
bit
too
tied
to
grapefruitycitrusy
hops
which
makes
it
seem
a
little
onedimensional
to
that
style
and
reduces
the
score
for
me
making
it
seem
more
mundane
as
well
da
well
done
pale
ale
that
i
would
drink
often
if
readily
available
d
easy
to
drink
but
solid
and
interesting

to
go
back
for
more

very
nice

that
ends

stays
with
you
for

that
i
experienced
in
the

as
some
other
great
examples
of
the
style

easygoing
and
hardly
made
a
dent
even
after
the
second
one
drinks
easy
and
tastes
solid
definitely
a
solid
and
enjoyable
sessioning
beer
this
is
what
i
consider
to
be
a
mediocre
and
pedestrian
pale
ale
i
expect
better
things
from
deschutes
especially
with

beers

drinkable

session
beer
with
enough
character

make
it

outa
this

it
is
highly
poundable

to
its
light
body
if
you
lived
in

a
sixer
would
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
at
a
gathering
the
appearence
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
some
nice
white
lacing
and
almost
zero

the
nose
has
some
piney

a

amount
of

in
there

some
slight

bitterness
with
a
light
malt
taste
coming
through
and
taking
over
a
slight
grassy

taste
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
nice
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
modest
pale
ale
good
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
overall
an
above
average
beer
and
a
very
good
pale
ale
pours
a
light
amber
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
with
a
fluffy
finger
of
head
that
eventually
dissolves
and
leaves
a
nice
layer
atop
the
glass
the
aroma
has
caramel
malt
and
a
floral
bouquet
of
hops
flavor
pretty
much
mirrors
the
aroma
with
a
gentle
citrus
bitterness
that
lingers
its
medium
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
ive
had
this
beer
numerous
times
both
from
the
bottle
and
ontap
its
definitely
my
fall
back

nothing
else
is
looking
appetizing

palate
is
somewhat
sharp
with
the

profile
again
though
the
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
is
quite
pleasant
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
hoppy
ales
ive
encountered
in
a
long
time
yeah
this
is
a
nice
apa
bright
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
it
diminishes
in
fairly
short
order
but
just
above
it
wafting
out
of
the
glass
is
a
fresh
citrusy
yet
sorta
grassy
hop
nose
nicely
balanced
taste
profile
a
bit
of
malt
thats
wonderfully
offet
by
some
tingling
on
the
tongue
from
the
hops
not
a
ton
of
bittering
hops
just
a
wellbalanced
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
just
where
i
think
an
apa
should
be
drinkability
kick
butt
i
consider
snpa
to
be
a
the
benchmark
of
apas
and
damn
tough
to
beat
but
id
rather
have
mirror
pond
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
at
the
grocery
store
poured
into
a
stemless
wine
glass
slightly
murky
orange
and
copper
hue
with
a
nice
little
cream
head
fresh
hop
aroma
reminds
me
of
dandelions
covered
with
honey
alcohol
is
evident
on
the
nose
after
20
minutes
of
warming
taste
is
sunny
with
solid
caramel
base
hints
of
lemon
or
grapefruit
enough
carbonation
to
perk
the
buds
without
that
overtingling
sensation
at
5
abv
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
night
long
i
think
i
will
d
definitely
not
a
horrible
brew
its
not
offensive
by
any
means
it
just
doesnt
really
have
much
complexity
or
intensity
to
it
refreshing
and
wouldnt
have
trouble
putting
a
few
down
really
not
a
standout
though
in
my
opinion
the
mouth
on
this
is
weak
and
wet
too
watery
for
my
liking
knocks
drinkability
down
a
notch
flavor
is
a
little
muted
as
well
its
not
offensive
at
all
just
slightly
absent
some
malts
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
this
beer
is
not
bold
in
any
way
and
i
think
it
needs
to
be
in
the
flavor
this
could
be
tweaked
a
little
not
bad
but
ive
had
much
better
d
balanced
smooth
refreshing
definitely
one
of
the
best
apas
and
session
brews
available
just
another
day
for
deschutes
d
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
a
pretty
wild
pale
ale
offering
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
considering
how
many
places
that
i
found
it
available
a
rock
solid
goto
micro
thats
easy
to
find
my
first
deschutes
and
theyve
definitely
got
me
interested
in
trying
more
overall
im
kinda
disappointed
in
the
mirror
pond
i
have
really
fond
memories
of
this
beer
from
when
my
sister
lived
in
oregon
and
she
would
send
some
back
to
me
im
gonna
say
that
the
bottle
isnt
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
and
probably
has
something
to
do
with
my
lower
score
here
verdict
mirror
pond
is
a
great
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
while
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
this
does
make
for
a
very
solid
session
beer
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
these
guys
are
cooking
as
far
as
ipas
and
double
ipas
go
simple
but
very
enjoyable
something
that
is
going
to
be
in
my
fridge
more
often
recommended
overall
impression
very
easy
to
drink
the
first
one
went
down
in
minutes
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
would
expect
more
hop
flavors
and
balance
more
towards
the
hops
in
american
pale
ale
that
said
it
is
still
a
great
beer
a
better
version
of
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
extremely
high
drinkability
and
perfect
amount
of
hops
does
not
overload
it
as
a
lot
of
these
west
coast
beers
are
apt
to
i
wish
i
could
easily
find
this
back
on
the
east
coast
as
its
my
favorite
example
of
an
apa
worth
seeking
out
this
should
be
considered
a
solid
goto
beer
suitable
for
quenching
thirst
after
yard
work
or
introducing
someone
to
the
world
of

a

some

maybe
even

than
the
more
typical

tasty

understated
carbonation
that
makes
for

d
probably
my
go

spring
training
really
hard
to
do
this
on
the
blackberry
same
citrusgrapefruit
in

as
in

the
flavor
is
quite
a

kind
of
like
a
toasted
sweet
bread
perfectly

beer
deschutes
may
very

in

im
jealous
of
people
who
can
get
this
regularly
md
medium

the
beer
finishes
on

sweeter
side
and
that
taste

very
easy

d
a

brew

for
an

this
one
falls

early
promise

with

a
good
middle
of

session
brew
its
mine
in

category
the
taste
is

but
compliments
the
tongue
nicely
it
is
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
some
other
pale
ales
the
fresh
hop
flavor
shines
through
and
its
a
real
refreshing
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
also
a
plus
in
that
it
gives
the
beer
good

not

bitter
not

i
feel

it
got
more
hoppy
as
i
drank
it
as
it
warmed
a

it
released
some

of

this
ones
for
you
mighty
fine
pale

would
have
loved

this
would
be
a

american
pale

this
it
easily
rises
above
most
other
options
in
the
supermarkets
yet
sets
you
back
less
than
a
sixer
of
piss
euro
lager
in
my
opinion
not
quite
as
tasty
as
sierra
nevadas
pale
but
an
outstanding
beer

all
accounts

had
this

still
a

d
no

drinking
this

one
of
the

session
beers
while
it
may
not
capture
the
attention
that
deschutes

with
most
any
food
not
an
overly
bold
statement
from
one
of
the
countrys
biggest
and
best
craft
brewers
but
certainly
one
of
their
best
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
find
on

easy
to
drink

always
will
buy

like
seeing
this
one
around

and
one
of
the
better
pales
ive
had
recently
im
not
a
fan
of
pales

this
one
definitely
stands
out
as
a
winner

the
category
with
some
solid
flavors
and
just
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
if
pales
is
your
thing
this
is
a
must
try
and
definitely
worth
trying
a
bottle
or
two
regardless
this
is
an
easy
beer

sit
down

session
no
sign

d
definitely

not
my

but
one
i
would
definitely
not
mind
having
again
though
theres
nothing
really
special
about
this
beer
it
is
eminently
drinkable
a
very
good
session
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
somewhat
hazy
orange
color
with
some
carbonation
a
little
lacing
it
had
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
collar
with
a
little
foam
in
middle
the
aroma
was
cascade
hops
grapefruit
and
some
malt
in
the
back
standard
apa
aroma
the
taste
was
nice
and
crisp
with
a
good
hop
bite
after
drinking
a
bunch
of
hop
bombs
lately
it
was
refreshing
to
get
a
nice
hop
bite
that
didnt
shred
the
tongue
overall
its
a
solid
beer
that
delivers
great
taste
without
tricking
it

while
this
is
not
a
hard

to
drink
i
feel
it
is
lacking
overall
dthis
is
really
really
good
beer
for
a
session
type
beer
that
comes
in
6pks
this
gets
it
done
i
am
looking
at
the
lacing
on
my
glass
and
noticed
that
every
drink
left
a
ring
and
every
ring
got
bigger
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
one
and
enjoy
every
sip
i
think
i
liked
this
one
better
from
the
bottle
i
found
this
a
little
nicer
than
deschutes
other
pale
ale
it
has
an
amber
color
and
a
good
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
solid
bouquet
of

this
may
not
be

ooops
theres
nothing
overly
standoutish
about
this
brew
except
for
how
solidly
its
put
together
everything
is
done
in
great
balance
and
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
if
i
had
a
lot
more
overall
just
a
really
nicely
done
beer
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
kind
of
reviewing
in
a
hurry
but
its
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
balance
is
way
off
to
the
hop
bitterness
side
thats
atypical
of
the
apas
ive
tried
nice
change
of
pace
d
a

any
apa
lover
would
love
this
goes

almost
some

at

taste
is
good
a
great
example
for
this
style
a
nice
kiss
of
hops
nothing
too
overwhelming
with
a
good
malt
backbone
it
does
have
a
different
hop
profile
than
its
more
famous
cousin
snpa
but
i
really
couldnt
tell
you
what
kind
of
hops
it
is
a
nice
light
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
moderate
an
easy
drinker
good
taste
and
good
example
of
an
apa
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
off
the
charts
it
is
a
perfect
summer
ale
for
the
hot
arizona
summers
and
it
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
the
summer
it
is
also
a
nice
one
as
a
transition
beer
for
friends
who
come
over
who
say
they
dont
like
craft
beer
mild
but
yet
bold
flavors
in
this
one
can
change
peoples
mind
about
what
they
should
expect
out
of
beer
not
an
iipa
but
that
is
why
i
love
it
a
true
summer
thirst
quencher
and
at
only
5
5
it
is
easily
sessionalble
around
a
bbq
in
the
hot
summer
sun
deschutes
brews
some
quality
beer
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
but
it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
overall
this
beer
could
be
good
fresh
its
a
little
sweet
and
has
very
little
hoppy
notes
id
try
it
again
just
to
confirm
or
debunk
what
i
wonder
about
this
beer
carbonation
seems
perfectly
matched
with
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
this
is
the
michael
rappaport
of
beers
good
but
underappreciated
tastes
better
than
a
b
d
this
one
certainly
isnt
the
most
complex
or
daring
apa
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
wouldnt
mind
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
on
this
warm
spring
night
very
sessionable
poured
into
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
it
is
golden
orange
in
color
and
has
a
creamy
off
white
head
which
dissapates
to
a
sticky
lace
the
nose
is
citusy
hops
with
hidden
malt
notes
the
taste
is
refreshing
hop
forward
and
has
a
nice
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
for
the
style
and
again
if
more
widely
available
would
drink
it
as
a
session
beer
more
often
the
color
is
a
medium
yellow
the
aroma
is
stronger
than
you
might
expect

is
a
nice
blend
of

are
hard
to
put
my

intriguing

of
the
better
ones
out
there

i
liked
this
beer
i
decided
to
match
it
up
with
a
spicy
taco
salad
for
dinner
and
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
results
west
coast
inspired
balanced
and
quite
quaffable
sent
my
way
by
a
kind
ba
i
would
have
this
again
this
beer
is
a
nice
beer
and
it
serves
its
niche
but
i
may
not
buy
this
again
just
not
my
style
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
another
outstanding
offering
from
deschutes
and
the
great
state
of
oregon
the
pacific
northwest
has
become
a
staple
to
me
for
great
beer
a
bit
of
weird
breadiness
keeps
this
one
from
getting
bought
be
my
every
time
im
at
deschutes
i
didnt
taste
it
so
much
in
one
of
the
two
mp
tastesamplers
that
i
had
last
week
so
maybe
the
new
recipe
will
make
this
my
new
deschutes
favorite
drinkability
very
nicely
balanced
example
of
a
west
coastinspired
pale
ale
the
first
thing
i
noted
is
that
this
is
a
bit
darker
than
a
lot
of
pales
certainly
darker
than
sierra
nevada
which
i
guess
is
my
comparison
point
for
pale
ales
more
orange
than
amber
nice
crisp
smell
with
citrus
hops
the
taste
was
basically
the
same
as
the
smell
with
clean
malt
and
plenty
of
c
hops
plenty
carbonated
but
easy
to
drink
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
west
coast
apa
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
probably
wont
see
it
till
i
head
out
west
again
caramel
honey
colored
pour
with
a
lasting
creamy
head
smell
is
of
an
almost
berry
like
hoppiness
at
first
but
it
fades
into
a
light
hoppy
almost
metallic
smell
as
it
opens
up
taste
is
mildish
hoppiness
with
a
sweet
finish
at
first
and
then
after
a
few
sips
a
hoppy
light
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
maybe
it
was
just
my
tummy
today
but
this
seemed
fairly
acidic
after
it
went
down
not
a
bad
pale
ale
at
all
either
way
there
are
more
i
like
better
but
i
could
still
have
this
again
d
excellent
this
is
a
gem
among
apas
ive
had
before
ill
have
again
it
stands
alongside
snpa
as
the
best
apa
available
at
least
in
my
mind
overall
a
pretty
solid
american
pale
ale
and
would
be
a
quality
session
beer
amber
in
color
decent
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
piney
northwest
hop
flavor
dominated
the
smell
light
malty
flavor
on
the
taste
with
a
little
fruitness
that
is
excentuated
by
the
dominant
hops
but
its
not
near
the
hop
level
of
an
ipa
or
sierra
nevada
a
touch
of
biscuit
flavor
as
well
finishes
fairly
clean
without
any
bad
aftertaste
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
better
than
your
average
fair
although
i
bet
this
one
goes
down
fast
and
gets
rated
higher
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
didnt
expect
much
so
i
wasnt
let
down
i
just
moved
to
a
beer
wasteland
but
i
can
find
this
everywhere
i
assume
i
will
have
this
on
hand
a
lot
since
there
is
not
much
else
give
me
a
few
years
and
i
assume
i
will
grow
to
love
it
an
all
time
classic
pale
ale
next
to
maybe
only
the
sierra
nevada
but
this
pale
is
stronger
and
can
stand
alone
as
an
adventure
a
little
more
deschutes
does
a
good
job
of
keeping
their
beer
developing
where
some
of
the
other
large
micros
start
to
remain
the
same
stagnant
in
their
creations
deschutes
pale
mirror
tastes
a
little
different
every
time
drinkablity
decent
brew
a
bit
tamer
than
i
expected
this
beer
was
my
first
introduction
to
deschutes
over
a
year
ago
i
had
it
on
tap
then
but
it
has
always
tasted
as
it
did
that
day
im
a
great
deschutes
fan
and
this
one
is
classic
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
several
of
over
the
course
of
an
evening
when
it
arrived
at
the
table
the
beer
had
little
head
on
top
and
a
hazy
ambertawny
body
there
are
two
things
you
need
to
know
about
this
beer
caramel
and
piney
citrus
the
first
half
is
a
wave
of
malt
and
the
second
half
closes
out
on
a
pleasant
hop
note
it
leaves
a
bready
and
sweet
aftertaste
on
the
palate
a
little
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
but
it
cleaned
my
palate
of
the
extreme
spiciness
from
the
dinner
i
had
pour
light
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
just
a
little
lace
moderate
bready
malt
with
slightly
perfumey
hops
smell
and
a
hint
of
sourness
the
sourness
isnt
exactly
unpleasant
but
it
doesnt
really
add
positively
either
the
flavor
is
good
with
a
nicely
balanced
malt
base
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
leading
into
an
acidic
and
bitter
finish
that
is
relatively
long
lived
the
aftertaste
also
picks
up
a
hint
of
sourness
as
it
warms
up
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
dry
texture
lively
carbonation
and
a
slightly
astringent
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
clean
pale
ale
that
goes
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
especially
grilled
meats
it
isnt
too
overhwelming
and
the
flavors
are
generally
good
but
not
overly
complex
pours
a
clear

some
head
that

good
bit
of
lacing

hoppy

heavy
with
hops
with
a
firm
citricsweet
edge
to
it
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
lemon
and
an
orange
feel
is
what
youd
expect
has
a
little
carbonation
to
it
and
it
feels
good
on
the
tongue
extremely
drinkable
d
its
understated
but
its
great
flavor
adds
to
its
drinkability
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
the
staple
of
deschuttes
brewery
black
butte
is
good
stuff
but
this
is
quite
possibly
the
most
floral
pale
on
the
american
market
this
beer
pours
like
a
normal
pale
light
amber
in
color
with
decent
head
the
nose
smells
like
a
florists
shop
fresh
grass
and
flowers
come
out
in
the
strong
cascade

flavor
very
smooth
and
not
bitter
at
all
a
very
unique
pale

brew
this
brew
is
a
staple
in
my
home
you
can
get
in
nearly
anywhere
for
good
reason
non
offensive
to
nearly
everyone
and
any
good
beer
drinker
this
could
easily
qualify
as
a
session
and
frequently
does
for
me
deschutes
is
a
world
class
brewing
company
and
gets
a
significant
portion
of
my
beer
budget

mirror

a
well
made
beer
by
a
great
brewery
but
im
never
going
to
fall
in
love
with

isnt

is
a
classic
american
pale
it
pours
a
nice
amber

with
a
nice
foam

that
leaves
some
nice

the
smell
is
fruity
the
taste
is
malty
up

in
a
biscuit
sort
of
a
way
then
it
is
fruity
and
finishes
with
a
dryness
on
tongue
like
a
dry
white
wine
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
overall
i
like
my
beers
a
little
more
aggressive
when
it
comes
to
hops
but
this
one
was
still
nice
there
is
a
nice
gentle
mix
of
malt
and
hops
which
would
make
it
a
perfect
gateway
beer
mouthfeels
about
average
for
a
pale
ale
not
a
hot

thirst
quencher
pairs
up
well
with
just
about

meal
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
clean
crisp
citrus
hops
followed
by
good
malt
backing
for
the

really
adds
to
a

d
a
good

not
great

but
ive
had
better
pales
though
not
a
bad
beer
for
any
means
certainly
a
good
try
for
those
hop
fans
on
the
west
coast
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
itll
scratch
your
hop
itch
but
light
enough
to
have
a

definitely
recommended

deschutes
is
really
doing
great
things
with
their
beers
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
this
beer
is
well
balanced
the
perfect

any
occasion
pours
a
light
amber
white
head
that
leaves
good
subtle
traces
the
session
drinker
would
be
happy
to
have
several
the
aroma
is
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
does
deliver
for
a
well
rounded
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
an
adequate
white
head
that
drops
off
steadily
leaving
tracks
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
excellent
bright
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
yeast
and
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
about
all
you
can
expect
from
an
apa
great
balance
between
the
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
this
is
a
delicate
brew
that
needs
to
be
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
in
order
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
really
is
at
the
time
i
reviewed
this
it
was
the
best
pale
ale
i
had
tried
since
then
its
been
supplanted
by
quite
a
few
others
most
notably
3floyds
alpha
king
drinkability
good
could
drink
several
of
these
especially
in
the
summer
time
when
it
was
tasted
d
goes
down
easy
would
make
a
solid
session
beer
and
very
refreshing
after
a
day
of
listening
to
your
sister
and
112
year
old
nephew
scream
at
each
other
most
of
the
country
would
probably
call
this
an
english
ipa
but
it
is
definitely
a
pacific
nw
pale
ale
the
front
tones
are
hops
all
wet
and
pungent
really
just
stick
to
the
tongue
cheeks
and
teeth
malts
balance
it
all
out
nicely
with
a
sugary
background

for
bringing
this
back
as
part
of
a
nice
beer
haul
she
picked
up
for
me

visit
home

poured
a

with

looking
head

with
some
pine

plenty
of

well
offset
by
the

i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
case
or
so
of
this
down
stairs
fantastic
drinkability
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
i
like
it
more
after
it
warms
close
to
room
temperature
and
that
is
how
i
would
go
through
a
six
pack
without
realizing
it

this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
that
can
easily
be
drank
in

quantities
there
are
other
beers
out
there
that
i
would
rather
drink
on
a
daily
basis

still
a
quality

a
great
beer

to
a

for
now
this
is
more

likely
awesome
on

and
would
love
to
try
it
in

the

are
subtle
enough
to
where
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
not
overly
dry

hoppy
the

well
i
love
the

of

fruit

every
sip
reminds
me
of
why
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale

some
pas
can
get
tiring
after
a

two

this

keeps
you
intrigued
i
wish
deschutes
would
distribute
back
east
but
i
understand
why
they
stay
on
the
west
coast
right
now
it
tastes
good
the
citruspine
northwest
hops
match
that
pale
bready
malt
but
not
the
west
coast
hophead
bonanaza
i
was
expecting
decent
body
with
a
crisp
finish
makes
it
go
down
easy
and
i
could
see
having
another
one
on
a
thirsty
afternoon
and
then
another
one
as
it
is
ive
tried
nine
beers
today
and
im
ready
for
bed
a
good
beer
definately
better
than
expected
for
the
style
the
appearance
was
a
bit
weak
it
looked
more
like
fizzy
pop
a
pet
peeve
of
mine
than
beer
but
all
in
all
pretty
solid
could
have
used
a
bit
more
hops
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
watery
d
a
very
good
tasting
hop
accented
pale
with
a
subtle
effervescence
nice
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
while
tinges
of
grapefruit
accent
this
easy
drinking
american
pale
i
acquired
this
bottle
from
the
bier
stein
eugene
or
it
poured
out
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
it
has
a
clouded
appearance
and
some
lacing
but
not
much
it
smells
of
floral
hops
but
it
doesnt
have
a
strong
aroma
overall
its
a
little
disappointing
in
the
taste
because
not
much
of
the
smellcomplexity
comes
through
and
its
mainly
a
taste
of
bitter
hopsaftertaste
that
dominates
it
d
id
gladly
drink
down
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
nice
sessioning
apa
strong
on
hops
without
ramping
up
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
very
active
carbonation
lightly
dry
bitter

drinkable

12oz

with

decent

aroma
was
a
mild
citrus
taste
was
mildly
bitter
finishing
sweet
very
accesible
and
enjoyable
pale
that
went
down
very
easily
i
had
no
problem
having
a
second
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
it
had
a
fairly
robust
taste
of
cascade
hops
and
just
sweet
enough
to
taste
the
way
i
prefer
my
pale
ales
it
was
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
a
very
enjoyable
and
accessable
pale
ale
this
has
elements
that
would
appeal
to
both
those
who
love
hops
and
those
who
arent
quite
as
keen
on
them
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
a
beer
that
ill
most
likely
get
again
drinkability
4
5
drinkability
is
very
good
plenty
of
flavor
but
it
still
goes
down
very
well
leaving
me
wanting
another
copper
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
slight
smells
of
hops
and
flowery
notes
the
first
taste
has
a
slight
bite
of
hops
but
not
a
strong
flavor
the
second
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
i
guess
the
word
for
this
brew
is
slight
a
decent
and
drinkable
beer
that
may
be
the
start
of
introducing
a
macro
drinker
to
the
world
of
micros
personally
i
would
probably
migrate
to
the
other
offering
from
deschutes
the
black
butte
porter
a
winter
fc
favorite
a
well
made
easy
drinker
d
pretty
drinkable
would
be
good
fresh
cant
say
enough
about
the
hoppiness

for
an
apa
this
one
packs
a
nice
little
punch
finish
is
not
as
dry
as
an
ipa
but
all
in
all
a
nice
composition
and
definitely
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
probably
the
finest
attribute
of
this
beer
overall
somewhat
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
this
is
an
excellent
session
worthy
apa
maybe
a
notch
below
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
its
close
and
at
times
i
do
prefer
this
one
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
pale
ales
on
the
market
if
you
see
this
in
your
local
liquor
store
pick
it
up
if
you
are
a
fan
of
american
pale
ales
you
need
to
get
your
hands
on
this
unfortunately
deschuttes
is
so
small
that
they
do
not
distribute
much
beyond
oregon
california
and
washington
d
mmm
its
so
nice
i
think
ill
have
another
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
great
example
of
an
apa
without
making
me
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
mini
ipa
like
so
many
other
pales
resemble
nice
bite
to
it
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
a
true
brew
for
all
seasons
she
provides
the
refreshment
one
would
require
while
mowing
something
or
bbqing
something
delicious
yet
at
the
same
time
substantive
enough
for
the
colder
months
it
would
be
a
tall
order
to
find
a
better
session
beer
adam
easy
to
drink
easily
sessionable
good
solid
beer
not
great
the
label
talks
about
a
generous
helping
of
cascade
hops
but
i
think
this
beer
lacks
a
bit
not
much
of
an
aroma
upon
pouring
and
there
seems
to
be
a
very
subtle
sweetness
that
distracts
from
what
hoppiness
there
is
kicks
up
a
frothy
head
that
makes
you
think
there
might
be
something
to
this
beer
but
in
the
end
it
doesnt
deliver
very
drinkable
i
was
very
happy
to
see
this
one
at
vons
pavillions
i
will
definately
revisit
this
one
again
and
again
oddly
im
rating
this
bottled
version
higher
than
the
ontap
i
think
its
because
the
ontap
head
had
faded
before
it
was
served
and
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
bit
flat
as
well
probably
due
to
the
locations
stock
or
equipment
matts
redmond
wa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
steady
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
going
like
a
good
pale
ale
should
be
i
could
easily
see
myself
grabbing
a
sixer
of
this
for
a
get
together
easily
drinkable
and
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
with
plenty
of
hop
character
i
hope
to
have
a
chance
to
try
more
brews
from
deschutes
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
this
one
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
there
right
now
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
and
let
it
warm
up
from
fridge
temp
it
has
a
color
that
is
between
golden
and
copper
with
a
nice
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
glass
there
is
a
gentle
sweetness
through
the
sip
that
finishes
with
a
citrusy
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
prefer
a
smell
that
has
a
little
more
grapefruit
attached
to
it
however
i
enjoy
how
the
beer
rolls
around
in
the
mouth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
is
quite
good
its
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
so
you
will
be
satisfied
although
you
may
get
bored
of
this
one
later
on
and
want
something
a
little
more
interesting
d
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
one
i
would
get
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
clean
tasting
the
flavors
are
well
represented
but
do
not
blow
me
away
the
beer
is
well
balanced
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
envision
sessioning
this
pale
ale
the
beer
poured
an
amber
copper
color
with
a
light
head
that
settled
into
a
medium
lacing
the
beer
had
a
sweet
malted
hops
smell
that
was
not
too
over
powering
the
taste
was
a
nice
blend
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
the
beer
feels
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
light
carbonation
over
all
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
summery
quality
that
makes
it
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
afternoon
barbque
cheers
to
deschutes
for
a
fine
pale
ale
overall
somehow
my
late
night
trip
to
vons
to
pick
up
some
light
bulbs
had
me
pondering
the
limited
beer
range
for
something
new
and
this
one
just
leapt
out
at
me
the
sixpack
was
a
little
more
money
than
the
other
regular
boring
selection
but
i
think
it
a
creditable
purchase
and
one
that
i
did
not
regret
maybe
ill
crack
a
fourth
bottle
a
winner
in
any
season
the
taste
is
intially
quite
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
grass
but
the
malt
moves
in
quickly
giving
it
a
nice
balance
and
a
fairly
sweetish
finish
over
all
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
and
easy
to
drink
apas
ive
had
a
lot
of
people
including
myself
on
occasion
knock
apas
but
this
one
is
addictively
good
drinkability
this
was
a
staple
ontap
selection
at
most
restaurants
we
frequented
and
i
can
see
why
pleasant
and
enjoyable
in
a
simple
way
nice
and
worth
having
several
of
enjoyed
mirror
pond
pale
at
brick
oven
pizza
in
crested
butte
co
after
a
long
day
of
hiking
we
found
this
establishment
while
walking
down
the
main
street
in
town
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
pale
ale
had
all
the
attributes
i
needed
to
wash
down
the
thin
crust
pizza
i
was
eating
the
beer
has
an
outstanding
pleasant
aroma
with
a
crisp
not
overwhelming
taste
its
slight
dry
mouthfeel
was
complimented
with
a
suttle
hop
flavor
the
deschutes
brewery
puts
out
some
great
products
i
only
wish
the
pale
ale
draught
was
available
in
more
locations
in
colorado
d
a
crisp
enjoyable
beer
quite
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
orangehued
testaceous
color
with
a
light
but
incomplete
film
of
head
over
top
the
brew
is
slightly
cloudy
with
just
a
few
stray
bubbles
making
their
way
to
the
surface
taking
a
smell
i
get
moderate
caramel
sweetness
with
even
a
touch
of
honey
this
is
backed
by
sweet
orange
and
lighter
grapefruit
citrusy
hop
even
a
light
kick
of
peppery
hop
as
well
i
like
how
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
a
little
subdued
and
lets
the
juicysmelling
hops
shine
through
this
one
has
good
balance
the
first
sip
brings
caramel
and
grapefruity
sweet
hop
this
moves
to
a
more
full
caramel
after
swallowing
with
a
very
nice
moderate
hoppy
bitter
that
clings
on
the
finish
but
not
harsh
and
offensive
the
aftertaste
is
very
orangey
citrusy
to
me
as
well
leaving
a
nice
dichotomy
between
the
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
playing
on
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
lightmoderate
carbonation
it
is
not
light
but
definately
nowhere
near
being
a
heavy
beer
and
i
think
it
hits
the
mouthfeel
very
well
for
the
flavors
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
an
apa
the
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
aroma
are
in
synch
with
each
other
and
its
something
i
could
make
a
nice
session
out
of
so
this
one
is
a
keeper
in
my
book
light
orange
with
head
of
foam
that
evaporates
slowly
significant
lace
left
in
glass
chop
grapefuit
aroma
and
malt
soft
on
the
palate
but
an
aftertaste
of
tongue
tingle
from
carbonation
medium
grapefruit
and
orange
flavours
with
bitter
and
a
tad
metallic
finish
never
mind
it
refreshing
though
drying
give
me
another
this
hot
summer
night
forget
all
the
details
all
you
need
to
know
is
this
is
the
pale
ale
of
our
time
its
a
lovely
deep
sunset
its
smells
like
fresh
citrus
hops
and
it
tastes
even
better
hops
are
the
big
picture
with
a
delicious
malt
backdrop
a
slight
mineral
aftertaste
lingers
along
with
your
thoughts
of
how
resfreshing
and
crisp
that
beer
you
just
drank
was
such
a
solid
offering
i
love
this
pours
a
golden
copper
with
a
fantastic
offwhite
head
lingering
for
the
duration
of
the
glass
with
pretty
decent
lacing
at
top
aroma
is
nicely
hopped
obvious
citric
fruits
not
a
wow
but
leading
to
a
really
good
tasting
beer
up
front
it
falls
short
toward
the
end
which
was
pretty
disappointing
after
the
first
mouthful
actually
im
finding
the
larger
the
sip
the
betterlonger
the
aftertaste
duh
anywho
good
hop
attack
up
front
malts
playing
nice
in
the
background
giving
way
to
esters
and
citric
bite
thats
not
really
a
bite
but
a
hold
that
lets
go
and
eases
into
a
finishing
hop
oil
that
isnt
too
outward
but
still
nice
a
medium
body
full
of
carbonation
up
front
and
smoothing
out
nicely
at
end
overall
quite
a
fine
beer
one
ill
be
glad
to
take
home
dark
amber
with
12
inch
head
little
detectable
aroma
taste
was
well
balanced
with
malt
hops
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
felt
like
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
a
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
which
was
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
so
tempting
to
drink
as
a
session
brew
but
at
5
50
it
has
caught
up
with
me
rather
fast
in
the
past
actually
it
also
is
so
flavorful
that
it
has
a
tendency
to
saturate
my
taste
buds
and
become
bothersome
after
too
many
one
of
the
best
beers
to
have
one
or
three
with
a
good
meal
or
just
on
its
on
d
this
feels
like
a
good
anytime
beer
no
doubt
a
good
pale
ale
ill
be
enjoying
this
again
in
the
future
overall
impression
very
drinkable
and
balanced
yet
another
quality
offering
from
deschutes
whenever
im
drinking
a
pale
ale
especially
a
west
coast
pa
its
hard
not
to
compare
it
to
the
gold
standard
snpa
not
only
does
mirror
pond
compare
to
sierra
nevada
very
favorably
but
in
some
ways
like
the
malt
note
it
may
even
be
superior
the
hopping
may
be
a
bit
lighter
than
snpa
but
this
is
a
first
rate
example
of
the
style
very
easy
drinker
hops
arent
as
out
front
as
i
prefer
and
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
however
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
clean
sharp
and
refreshing
wonderfully
balanced
light
sessionable
summer
beer
dark
orange
subtle
hop
aroma
of
grapefruits
tang
and
oranges
very
approachable
juicy
fruity
and
well
balanced
hop
profile
in
the
mouth
with
notes
of
grapefruit
orange
and
other
citrus
fruits
the
meek
malt
presence
serves
its
purpose
and
balances
well
very
creamy
and
quite
good
notes
as
it
warmed
breadiness
comes
through
with
some
balls
this
is
one
easy
drinker
and
kept
my
interest
throughout
worthy
effort
another
excellent
and
very
drinkable
beer
from
the
folks
at
deschutes
brewery
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
regular
session
brew
for
me
d
overall
not
a
bad
pale
ale
i
have
had
mirror
pond
many
times
before
and
i
remember
it
smelling
and
tasting
much
better
than
this
bottle
perhaps
ill
have
to
get
another
sometime
and
compare
my
rating
pours
a
hazyish
clear
medium
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
nice
lacing
for
an
apa
smell
is
of
melons
and
berries
malt
dominates
with
a
little
hop
taste
is
nice
with
much
of
the
same
characeristics
as
the
smell
very
clean
with
a
lot
of
flavor
not
as
hoppy
as
most
apas
but
that
doesnt
distract
from
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
but
not
bad
overall
drinkablity
is
great
not
offensive
at
all
and
could
easily
go
down
one
after
another
the
taste
is
lighter
than
i
expected
but
im
a
hop
addict
so
i
am
slightly
biased
it
finishes
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
could
be
the
easiest
session
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
not
strong
on
the
hops
but
delightfully
balanced
overall
when
i
first
started
drinking
beer
i
tried
a
couple
of
pale
ales
and
decided
to
avoid
the
style
because
the
hops
were
too
bitter
mirror
pond
avoids
the
over
the
tops
hops
for
a
more
balanced
approach
which
i
liked
a
lot
next
time
i
am
buying
beer
i
might
not
avoid
pale
ales
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
think
its
a
little
bitter
for
my
taste
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
much
of
it
but
its
a
nice
occasional
change
of
pace
easy
drinking
pa
that
goes
down
great
not
as
good
as
the
draft
version
and
the
one
time
was
luck
enough
have
this
on
cask
wow
but
this
works
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pa
that
wont
blow
your
lips
off
and
still
excite
the
hophead
inside
you
very
well
executed
and
highly
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
tried
this
would
be
a
regular
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
locally
very
pleasant
amer
pale
ale
smell
is
faint
but
has
hints
of
bubble
gum
and
light
citrus
taste
is
unexpected
with
a
very
strong
grapefruitlike
note
coming
all
the
way
through
body
is
substantial
until
about
twothirds
of
the
way
through
it
then
it
effervesces
into
very
little
finish
is
sweet
with
a
light
malt
left
on
the
tongue
for
a
few
seconds
this
leaves
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
which
warrants
another
sip
slàinte
drinkability

for
my
money
this
is
the
most
drinkable
american
pale
ale
ive
tasted
i
am
continually
amazed
by
its
balance
and
how
frequently
im
in
the
mood
for
this
very
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
like
i
said
its
a
solid
fallback
man
do
i
love
this
pale
ale
as
excited
as
i
was
to
see
that
this
one
would
be
a
part
of
the
tasting
clinic
i
was
volunteering
with
at
the
world
beer
festival
i
was
more
excited
to
see
two
or
three
bottles
left
over
afterwards
after
the
final
tasting
was
done
i
got
to
enjoy
this
one
with
some
great
people
i
just
met
real
balance
of
malts
and
hops
nothing
to
bitter
almost
perfect
in
my
book
too
bad
i
cannot
find
this
one
close
by
yet
had
the
privelage
of
sampling
this
beer
many
times
yesterday
at
the
wbfpoured
a
slightly
hazy
deep
orange
with
a
clingy
white
head
on
top
to
be
expected
this
oregon
produced
pale
ales
aromas
are
hop
dominated
wich
is
a
good
thing
fruity
citrus
with
underlying
pine
very
fresh
smelling
this
goes
down
very
easily
and
would
be
a
staple
of
mine
if
i
could
get
it
hereflavors
are
pretty
nicely
balanced
there
is
a
firm
dry
maltiness
up
front
finishing
with
the
big
dose
of
cascades
in
the
finish
citrus
and
pine
linger
nicely
deschutes
makes
some
damn
fine
brews
i
wish
i
could
get
them
more
locally
instead
offline
it
poured
a
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
fat
two
inch
head
the
floral
scents
were
impressive
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
liked
it
up
front
but
extremely
drinklable
loral
hints
throughout
and
extremely
smooth
a
tremendous
choice
for
a
session
beer
could
probably
drink
a
six
pack
with
ease
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
selections
from
deschutes
a
nice
hazy
orangered
with
a
white
head
that
falls
fast
looks
good
but
it
does
not
smell
like
much
in
fact
the
piney
boquet
is
light
that
it
takes
some
doing
to
detect
but
things
pick
up
when
it
comes
to
the
third
sense
taste
which
is
well
balanced
allowing
the
nutty
malt
flavors
to
come
out
without
being
sweet
the
touch
is
also
nice
it
feels
good
in
the
mouth
it
is
slightly
parching
but
only
enough
to
make
you
want
to
drink
another
i
really
like
this
beers
appearance
in
my
regular
pint
glass
it
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
a
pale
white
head
a
bit
lacking
in
thickness
bubbles
are
visible
slowly
rising
throughout
the
glass
it
has
a
nice
crisp
and
hoppy
aroma
floral
scents
help
to
give
its
hop
smell
a
very
well
balanced
appeal
the
taste
at
first
is
a
bit
disappointing
and
thin
but
as
the
beer
warms
its
citrus
flavors
become
more
apparent
in
addition
the
presence
of
a
hoppy
kick
at
the
end
added
to
a
slight
bitter
bite
help
to
complete
its
flavor
in
the
mouth
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
is
not
very
full
but
its
flavor
does
linger
for
quite
a
time
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
it
is
not
overdone
at
all
and
hence
very
drinkable
balance
is
the
key
to
its
success
i
would
say
that
on
those
occasions
when
a
moderatelyhopped
up
and
tasty
pale
is
desired
m
p
p
a
would
hit
the
spot
this
brew
could
pretty
much
be
the
reference
for
perfect
drinkability
tasty
and
mild
without
beating
any
of
your
senses
into
submission
i
could
drink
this
everyday
and
be
very
happy
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
give
this
brew
the
highest
possible
recommendation
appearance
is
a
cloudy
golden
with
some
white
lace
and
some
lacing
aroma
contains
floral
hops
and
banana
esters
along
with
nicely
balanced
hops
and
malt
initial
taste
is
of
sweet
crackers
and
malt
citrusyfruity
bitter
hops
and
somewhat
dry
finish
has
a
dry
even
feel
that
goes
well
with
food
darker
than
some
and
better
balanced
than
many
this
is
a
classic
pnw
pale
ale
that
really
hits
the
spot
reasonable
hop
nose
is
followed
by
a
real
nice
balanced
body
that
is
drinkable
to
the
core
i
think
that
this
is
the
closest
the
pnw
comes
to
snpa
dated
090205
poured
a
slight
hazy
golden
color
with
some
nice
lacing
has
a
very
nice
taste
not
bitter
at
all
compared
to
other
pale
ales
ive
had
in
the
past
very
nice
body
on
the
light
side
very
light
compared
to
other
pale
ales
very
drinkable
i
could
get
use
to
drinking
alot
of
these
for
me
34
i
really
like
the
taste
a
very
socialble
brew
a
good
summer
quaffer
drinkability
ill
have
to
try
a
bottled
version
of
this
and
rerate
in
the
future
may
get
a
better
rating
from
what
i
tasted
i
enjoyed
though
this
pale
ale
has
a
nice
zesty
bite
to
it
the
grapefruit
flavour
isnt
as
strong
as
it
is
in
the
cinder
cone
red
ale
here
it
is
more
of
a
highlight
rather
than
dominant
feature
i
think
this
would
be
well
enjoyed
by
both
lager
drinkers
as
well
as
hopheads
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
to
sample
slightly
hazy
appearance
and
a
pleasant
light
hoppy
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
with
mild
hops
and
a
bit
of
citrus
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
manageable
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
a
good
bangforthebuck
that
doesnt
overpower
food
and
even
nonbeerdrinkers
wont
find
offensive
its
handy
to
keep
some
around
atop
the
cascades
another
nice
offering
from
deschutes
this
was
rather
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
immediately
i
was
glad
there
was
no
ipa
and
boasted
the
usual
creamy
raisin
flavoured
deschutes
backing
they
certainly
werent
being
stingy
with
the
malt
here
this
was
a
well
coordinated
and
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
reasonable
feel
lots
of
small
bubbles
perhaps
i
should
drink
more
pale
ale
rather
than
ipa
but
more
likely
i
should
drink
more
deschutes
beer
i
find
deschutes
to
be
the
most
dependable
brewery
never
a
bad
beer
good
stuff
i
did
notice
the
higher
alcohol
content
in
this
one
though
as
it
kicked
in
on
me
soon
into
my
second
beer
pouring
with
a
nice
lasting
head
mirror
pond
is
the
definitive
pale
ale
starts
off
slightly
sour
and
finishes
with
the
bitterness
you
expect
from
a
pale
ale
in
the
background
i
taste
some
hints
of
wood
this
style
of
beer
has
never
been
my
favorite
but
mirror
pond
is
definately
an
easy
drinker
good
for
just
about
any
occasion
my
fiance
acted
as
air
courier
to
bring
me
a
sixer
back
from
her
trip
to
spokane
i
am
even
further
indebted
to
this
lovely
lady
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
goldenorange
hue
with
a
smallish
gleaming
white
head
lovely
aroma
of
fresh
floral
hops
some
sweet
malt
and
notes
of
pine
and
astringency
palate
begins
with
light
sweet
malt
then
the
hops
kick
in
nice
rich
floral
hops
coat
the
tongue
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
body
is
full
and
slightly
creamy
almost
perfect
if
i
had
to
pick
one
session
beer
for
life
this
would
definitely
be
it
although
maybe
it
would
be
from
the
beer
engine
at
the
horse
brass
tried
on
tap
in
downtown
portland
at
a
very
busy
pub
for
a
pale
ale
it
looked
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
looked
almost
amber
a
very
nice
citrus
aroma
but
the
malt
backbone
of
this
beer
seems
to
be
too
much
as
the
beer
had
some
sweetness
that
i
wouldnt
expect
very
little
head
retention
with
some
large
surface
bubbles
during
the
first
few
sips
gonna
have
to
give
this
another
try
someday
to
see
if
i
just
had
a
bad
pint
id
love
to
sample
this
with
some
sharp
cheddar
goes
down
so
smooth
and
at
5
abv
it
would
make
a
very
nice
session
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
interestingly
soft
and
foamy
which
i
liked
especially
from
an
american
pale
ale
but
i
think
in
the
end
it
lent
it
a
somewhat
watery
feel
and
decided
that
id
like
it
a
bit
firmer
the
taste
as
i
was
affraid
was
much
like
the
smell
seemed
rather
bland
there
was
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
but
not
much
else
a
bit
dissapointed
since
im
a
big
fan
of
many
of
their
other
beers
mirror
pond
is
a
decent
all
around
pale
ale
thats
best
found
in
a
bottle
the
draught
version
served
by
deschutes
has
a
plump
mouthfeel
and
a
companionable
flavor
but
otherwise
stirs
little
excitement
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
color
it
has
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
floral
aroma
slightly
citrusy
taste
is
of
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
citrus
mild
hop
bitterness
on
back
of
tongue
good
mouthfeel
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
my
friend
sent
me
a
few
of
these
from
out
west
i
wish
this
was
sold
around
here
in
mi
this
would
definately
be
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
i
guess
i
dont
need
to
recommend
it
to
anybody
on
the
west
coast
im
sure
your
probably
drinking
one
right
now
try
it
if
youve
never
had
poured
a
rich
deep
gold
almost
amber
ale
with
a
thick
slightly
tan
head
that
subsided
slowly
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
floral
hops
with
distinct
fruity
esters
mixed
in
the
taste
is
bittersweet
on
the
initial
taste
with
a
clean
cascade
hop
flavor
supported
by
a
sweet
carmel
malt
but
the
initial
impression
is
on
hop
flavor
not
bitterness
the
absence
of
high
alpha
hop
roughness
gives
credibility
to
the
pale
aleness
of
mirror
pond
as
the
hops
are
deliciously
there
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
as
with
other
deschutes
brews
is
great
when
concerning
the
carbnonation
and
carbonic
bite
but
in
terms
of
body
i
belive
this
is
lacking
but
not
of
making
this
beer
poor
very
drinkable
but
i
like
the
black
butte
or
quial
springs
for
a
session
beer
instead
of
htis
one
as
the
hops
could
become
less
distinct
after
the
first
pint
good
ol
mirror
pond
its
available
literally
everywhere
in
portland
every
bar
every
grocery
store
every
711
and
plaid
pantry
luckily
its
a
good
beer
and
deserving
of
its
popularity
it
along
with
sierra
nevada
may
be
the
premier
americanstyle
pale
ale
or
at
least
the
west
coast
version
its
full
of
malt
full
of
hops
well
balanced
and
drinkable
but
manages
to
pack
a
slight
punch
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
filling
i
dont
know
if
the
beer
is
bottleconditioned
but
it
feels
like
it
pours
a
tawny
orange
with
great
head
and
lace
hops
dominate
the
flavor
with
fruit
flavors
that
marry
well
with
the
sweet
malts
despite
the
bitterness
the
finish
is
on
the
sweet
side
and
soft
fruit
flavors
linger
such
as
peach
or
mango
it
is
an
everyday
brew
although
for
an
ordinary
beer
it
is
lucky
that
we
have
one
as
tasty
as
this
many
cities
have
to
make
do
with
bud
or
coors
it
may
be
a
drawback
to
some
that
it
absolutely
must
be
poured
into
a
glass
it
just
doesnt
work
from
the
bottle
a
beer
not
to
be
overlooked
this
was
another
beer
i
really
wanted
to
try
while
in
denver
we
dont
get
deshutes
in
boston
that
i
know
of
so
i
jumped
at
the
tap
when
i
saw
it
the
bear
poured
a
bright
copper
with
a
thick
full
white
head
a
nice
lace
stayed
for
the
entire
beer
it
had
a
bright
citrus
aroma
from
the
hops
more
hop
character
than
i
expected
the
taste
was
light
and
fruity
from
the
hops
not
the
yeast
with
a
light
floral
middle
it
had
a
light
mouth
feel
and
a
great
drinkability
nice
candidate
for
a
session
beer
12
oz

a
amber
hued
liquid
with
a
decent

that
quickly
fades
to
a
sheen
has
a
very
slight
sweet
caramel
smell
with
a
whiff
of
hops
has
a
medium
body
with
a
taste
of
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
smidgin
of
floral
hop
bitterness
to
finish
a
very
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
maybe
too
smooth
mirror
pond
pale
ale
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
thats
perfect
for
enjoyment
while
camped
out
in
front
of
the
tv
watching
football
college
or
pro
another
great
beer
by
deschutes
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
in
the
u
s
a
bottle
brought
to
our
brewers
of
south
the
suburbs
meeting
light
in
color
with
a
thin
head
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
as
hoppy
as
other
people
have
described
it
just
a
nice
clean
smell
and
taste
that
goes
down
well
and
another
brewer
i
hope
to
sample
further
in
the
future
mens
journal
recently
stated
that
mirror
pond
pale
ale
is
americas
best
beer
hardly
but
it
is
a
fine
drinkable
example
of
the
american
pale
ale
style
most
everyone
should
enjoy
this
fine
ale
from
one
of
the
pacific
northwests
best
breweries
i
know
that
i
do
drinkability

this
went
down
well
enough
this
should
become
a
blueprint
for
all
other
pale
ales
pours
an
amber
orange
with
a
semi
whitetan
head
that
grows
to
great
proportions
then
fades
to
about
an
inch
the
smell
is
of
strong
floral
and
citrus
hints
of
hops
characteristics
very
clean
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
the
sweetness
of
the
floralorange
citrus
and
the
bitter
tangy
lemon
hops
some
pine
notes
detected
as
well
very
light
and
refreshing
goes
down
about
as
good
as
a

quenching

verison
of

legitimate
hopping
going
on
here
for
a
pale
ale
this
has
much
more
of
a
roasted
malt
base
than
i
anticipated
i
like
it
hop
profile
is
piney
citrusy
just
like
with
the
aroma
though
it
seems
subdued
a
bit
but
does
linger
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thin
a
dry
finish
makes
this
highly
highly
drinkable
solid
thanks
to
skyhand
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
purposely
paired
it
with
my
penne
and
andouille
in
a
pancetta
and
smoked
gouda
sauce
recipe
doesnt
have
beer
so
you
cant
have
it
perfect
it
doesnt
overwhelm
any
part
of
the
sauce
yet
it
can
stand
up
to
the
andouille
and
smoke
and
cut
right
through
the
dairy
the
flavor
is
snappy
and
comes
with
a
good
solid
amount
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sharp
but
it
is
still
very
drinkable
zum
wohl
its
simple
poorly
balanced
and
quite
thin
but
the
excellent
hop
flavor
and
mild
carbonation
redeem
it
nicely
works
for
me
the
smell
is
the
best
part
of
this
one
and
is
hoppy
and
tart
through
and
through
a
warm
sweet
alcoholic
maltiness
insinuates
itself
at
the
close
taste
is
top
notch
as
well
and
is
wonderfully
refreshing
crisp
fruit
notes
are
present
here
as
well
as
huge
hops
that
suggest
juniper
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
good
and
slightly
oily
the
carbonation
adds
to
the
complexity
but
does
not
get
in
the
way
drinkability
is
supreme
quickly
becoming
a
classic
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
that
wasnt
terribly
special
but
certainly
not
offensive
certainly
its
eminently
drinkable
and
not
bad
if
you
can
get
it
on
sale
otherwise
dont
strain
anything
to
get
a
hold
of
it
nice
clear
amber
with
orange
tones
small
frothy
offwhite
head
very
little
carbonation
the
cascade
hops
are
evident
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
with
a
tingly
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
which
makes
the
brew
feel
sweet
even
though
it
isnt
sweet
at
all
very
drinkable
a
nice
pale
ale
drinkability
my
first
real
love
of
west
coast
beers
thanks
to
dave
for
making
me
try
this
one
well
done
but
wish
i
had
a
fresher
bottle
good
foam
to
the
head
when
poured
into
your
glass
the
aroma
promises
a
nice
hoppy
spiceyness
the
tastey
hop
strength
in
the
flavor
might
be
more
than
some
people
would
expect
from
a
pale
ale
but
is
just
what
i
would
expect
from
a
west
coast
beer
a
tasty
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
a
good
hop
precence
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
hope
to
score
more
of
it
somehow
here
on
the
east
coast
ive
been
told
its
better
on
tap
and
on
the
west
where
its
fresh
a
translucent
amber
on
the
pour
with
a
modest
and
creamy
head
that
is
light
tan
in
color
the
left
over
lace
forms
a
fine
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
rich
in
malt
crisp
and
clean
maybe
even
a
tad
lemon
like
sweet
start
with
a
moderate
feel
to
the
palate
finish
benignly
acidic
the
hops
pleasant
and
welcoming
in
their
spiciness
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
a
damn
good
session
beer
light
copper
body
with
a
sticky
offwhite
head
surprisingly
aromatic
big
fruity
malts
and
lots
of
resiny
hops
taste
the
malt
presence
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
its
a
bit
toffeeish
but
this
is
walloped
by
a
large
dose
of
pacnw
hops
a
little
unbalanced
i
believe
finish
is
dry
appetizingly
bitter
with
lingering
apple
cider
notes
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
copper
color
quite
clear
as
well
pours
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
has
hints
of
lychee
and
grapefruit
definitely
an
american
hop
signature
here
quite
malty
tasting
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
that
hits
the
tongue
up
front
this
beer
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
it
seemed
to
be
missing
the
american
hop
punch
that
the
aroma
promised
other
than
this
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
theres
a
fine
line
between
some
pale
ales
and
ipas
and
this
is
certainly
the
case
with
mirror
pond
i
tried
this
brew
6
years
ago
and
its
the
same
today
as
it
was
then
ambercopper
in
color
fast
fading
white
head
and
some
patches
of
sticky
lace
a
good
floral
hop
aroma
dominates
a
faintly
sweet
malty
smell
theres
a
fair
amount
of
malty
body
in
this
brew
a
lemony
citrus
and
lightly
spicy
hop
bitterness
possess
quite
a
potent
tangy
bite
it
mellows
out
and
becomes
more
balanced
at
around
the
halfway
point
nice
bottle
thanks
to
genaro
for
bringing
this
back
from
his
trip
to
oregon
mint
bubble
gum
and
cream
aromas
rise
up
reluctantly
from
the
orangebrown
liquid
grapefruit
alcohol
and
crushed
seeds
appear
in
the
flavor
a
leaner
malt
profile
here
barely
able
to
support
the
bitter
grapefruitskin
hop
notes
perhaps
not
the
result
of
an
obsession
with
quality
but
the
thing
does
drink
a
little
more
roast
some
funkier
yeast
and
you
have
bells
for
fans
of
the
craft
pale
scene
maybe
a
clever
little
brew
for
me
i
can
live
without
it
deep
golden
color
with
a
moderate
soft
white
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
brisk
blast
of
pacific
northwest
citrusy
hops
refreshing
and
tasty
the
malt
body
is
clean
tasting
with
a
slight
nutty
flavor
rounded
out
with
a
nice
finishing
hop
bitterness
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
dark

medium

this
brew
a
nice
bottle
conditioned
pale
ale
had
this
nice
little
brew
while
in
portland
recently
pretty
average
in
appearance
and
smell
as
this
may
have
been
on
tap
too
long
however
the
taste
was
extremely
good
something
i
am
starting
to
expect
from
deschutes
brewery
had
a
good
mouthfeel
to
it
good
play
between
the
malts
and
hops
this
is
another
extrely
drinkable
beer
from
this
brewery
makes
me
want
to
abandon
the
desert
as
i
do
not
think
this
is
available
in
arizona
overall
impression
on
par
with
their
black
butte
porter
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
that
ive
tried
delicious
no
complaints
at
all
about
this
one
in
fact
i
really
like
this
beer
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
a
very
nice
pale
ale
overall
a
very
good
apa
too
bad
this
and
full
sail
pale
ale
arent
available
here
theyre
2
great
pacific
nw
apas
originally
sampled
on
21
august
2002
had
this
at
deschutes
brewpub
while
in
bend
or
its
hoppy
w
a
nice
nose
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
amber
color
it
finishes
fairly
well
balanced
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
pale
ale
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
a
bit
of
a
head
but
it
did
stay
around
for
a
little
while
fairly
decent
aroma
of
hops
to
the
nose
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
a
fairly
decent
hop
bite
at
the
end
it
gets
high
points
for
being
crisp
and
clean
not
spectacular
but
a
decent
pale
ale
i
love
this
beer
the
flavor
starts
calm
slightly
hoppy
however
once
swallowed
the
tongue
gets
the
true
delight
the
copious
amounts
of
hops
linger
well
after
drank
and
leave
you
thirsty
for
another
gulp
my
favorite
part
could
be
the
fact
this
beer
goes
unfiltered
so
a
generous
amount
of
yeast
builds
to
the
bottom
convincing
you
to
finish
each
and
every
one
opened
to
get
that
blessed
b12
rich
hangover
antidote
highly
recommended
the
beer
pairs
well
with
asian
foods
and
with
trivial
pursuit
or
whatever
it
is
you
do
in
the
evenings
with
your
drinking
buddies
another
good
oregon
beer
very
drinkable
a
good
session
brew
for
those
that
like
to
tatse
hops
hops
hops
nice
pale
ale
tap
is
a
lot
better
than
bottle
the
6pack
i
bought
tasted
a
lot
more
hoppy
than
i
memember
the
draught
was
like
at
a
local
restaurant
i
didnt
like
the
hoppy
cascade
flavor
not
when
it
says
pale
ale
on
the
label
but
still
enjoy
it
p
s
seven
years
later
im
a
little
embarrassed
with
this
review
now
that
its
becoming
prevalent
in
my
hometown
market
i
intend
to
review
a
freshly
tapped
pint
someday
soon
due
to
the
mildness
i
consider
this
is
more
of
a
ladies
beermy
girlfriend
really
likes
it
however
it
is
not
so
bland
that
i
couldnt
knock
down
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
it
pours
pale
orange
amber
with
small
quickly
fading
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
hops
although
not
powerful
a
bit
citrusy
a
bit
floral
the
flavor
flipflops
being
mostly
malt
ver
breaddoughy
like
multigrain
bread
the
finish
is
dry
and
short
the
palate
is
soft
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
in
flavor
for
my
tastes
but
it
isnt
bad
this
fine
offering
from
deschutes
in
oregon
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
lace
was
wispy
from
a
decent
head
i
liked
the
hoppy
aroma
and
while
i
expected
a
more
prominent
hop
finish
i
wasnt
let
down
this
beer
was
very
smooth
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
otherwise
i
say
go
for
it
nice
golden
somewhat
cloudy
amber
color
head
leaves
something
to
be
desired
though
no
head
also
means
no
artistic
lace
on
the
glass
the
only
good
part
of
that
is
that
itll
be
easier
to
clean
the
glass
if
i
forget
to
rinse
it
out
good
flavor
that
is
both
malty
and
hoppy
but
not
too
extreme
either
way
good
beer
in
my
opinon
but
i
think
the
cheesy
hop
embossing
job
on
the
bottle
needs
to
go
mirror
pone
pale
ale
is
dischutes
best
beer
not
to
malty
and
grainy
but
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
bring
everything
together
the
flavor
seem
to
get
more
complex
as
it
got
warmer
in
the
glass
i
think
one
of
the
best
american
pales
out
there
many
breweries
stay
ligth
on
the
malt
to
bring
out
more
hop
flavor
but
mirror
pond
has
a
great
malty
character
to
balance
out
the
wonderful
flavor
of
the
cascade
hops
love
this
stuff
heavily
hopped
noticable
on
the
nose
and
the
buds
good
fruity
hop
notes
citrucy
bittering
units
are
much
higher
on
this
one
than
their
other
pale
ale
i
would
assume
nice
frothy
creamy
head
that
settles
nicely
cloudy
gold
in
color
tastes
like
it
was
dryhopped
a
spicy
fruity
ale
without
enough
malt
backbone
decent
and
more
adventurous
and
flavorfull
than
their
other
pale
ale
cascade
ale
but
not
as
balanced
i
prefer
the
other
one
cascade
ale
even
though
it
lacks
this
flavor
because
i
see
this
as
a
little
unbalanced
a
very
good
apa
overall
well
rounded
flavor
nothing
outstanding
its
ground
however
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
either
what
else
can
i
say
but
you
are
about
to
drink
a
very
good
apa
this
is
a
great
americal
plae
ale
i
think
elk
baiter
mistakenly
pickdt
up
a
bottle
of
nail
polish
instead
of
mirror
pond
there
is
no
way
this
stuff
and
be
considered
dry
or
bitter
it
has
a
lovely
rounded
maltyness
if
anything
a
small
tiny
touch
of
sweetness
with
a
understated
bitterness
and
only
a
small
hop
flavor
if
you
find
it
you
must
try
it
it
is
just
good
beer
more
sweet
malt
as
a
flavour
with
a
little
spicy
and
piny
hops
behind
one
of
the
best
apa
i
have
had
this
is
the
best
part
of
the
hop
trip
this
is
the
hop
trip
the
best
part
i
really
like
what
did
he
say
sorry
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
tawny
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
zest
orange
zest
pine
resin
light
grass
and
a
healthy
amount
of
caramel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
resin
takes
a
stronger
position
here
luckily
the
caramel
balances
things
out
rather
well
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
wellbalanced
hoppy
pale
ale
not
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
great
with
very
juicy
hop
flavor
which
has
a
slight
mango
and
grapefruit
combo
with
tangerine
type
taste
with
mild
malt
that
has
a
toasted
quality
and
subtle
pine
in
the
hop
profile
as
it
finishes
with
mild
caramel
however
the
finish
is
mostly
dry
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
even
though
deschutes
is
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
since
i
first
tried
them
decades
ago
i
expected
it
to
be
good
and
this
is
great
very
highly
recommend
this
great
pale
ale
hoppy
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
its
good
best
by
date
122814
would
like
to
have
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
with
just
not
enough
intense
hop
presence
for
me
on
this
on
earthy
and
muddled
certainly
more
bready
than
bitter
pretty
average
overall
unfortunately
the
best
before
date
on
my
particular
bottle
was
a
couple
of
days
before
consumption
date
and
i
think
this
affected
the
rating
had
on
tap
medium
carbonation
i
love
most
offering
from
deschutes
this
one
was
a
miss
for
me
came
in
underpowered
on
flavor
perhaps
true
fans
of
the
apa
style
will
have
more
appreciation
for
this
than
i
did
still
an
above
average
beer
just
not
one
i
will
seek
out
again

i

mouthfeel

to

when
theyre
the
feel
is
crisp
in

with
a
nice

it
has
some
smoothness
in

middle
and
finishing
well
even
as
it
goes
semidry
not
losing
the
creaminess
it
obtains
after

up

looking
at
some
of
the

reviews
its

to
believe
im

this

that
the

i
enjoyed
the
sn
harvest
ale
more
than
this
but
this
is
still
tasty
this
is
nice
citrusy
hops
first
grapefruit
and
lemon
zest
but
not
overpowering
then
a
little
toffee
and
caramel
malt
sweet
and
yet
bitter
big
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
very
nicely
done
thanks
younger
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinks
too
easy
i
could
happily
session
on
this
this
is
not
the
greatest
tasting
beer
in
the
world
but
its
very
nicely
done
and
its
lightness
in
body
flavor
and
alcohol
make
it
highly
drinkable
drinkability
sitting
at
5
5
with
superb
balance
this
is
one
hell
of
a
good
beer
great
hop
presence
for
the
hop
heads
but
not
enough
to
scare
the
rest
of
us
away
its
a
shame
they
can
only
make
this
beer
once
a
year
but
well
worth
the
wait
its
a
fantastic
treat
highly
recommended
one
of
the
best
fresh
hop
beers
i
have
had
but
overly
excited
about
its
taste
everything
else
in
on
par
grab
one
of
these
before
they
are
gone
if
from
my
area
hitime
wine
cellar
in
costa
mesa
still
has
several
bottles
of
this
for
about
the
same
price
i
paid
for
it
d
probably
the
best
overall
wethop
beer
i
have
had
to
date
even
better
than
sierra
nevada
fresh
hop
harvest
ale
definitely
a
treat
if
you
can
find
it
in
your
area
d
heck
yeah
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
hoppy
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
slightly
bitter
and
some
caramel
slightly
drybitter
finish
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
apa
from
deschutes
recommended
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
rusted
gold
color
with
an
adequate
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
quickly
while
leaving
a
few
rings
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
floral
with
both
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
character
like
mangoes
and
oranges
with
a
little
jasmine
or
something
the
taste
is
similar
not
much
bitterness
to
this
one
there
is
a
light
honeylike
sweetness
that
is
actually
quite
pleasant
not
cloying
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
somewhat
oily
with
light
carbonation
that
is
just
enough
to
tickle
the
tongue
a
bit
and
provide
a
small
jab
to
the
throat
with
each
sip
overall
a
quality
beer
that
would
be
easy
for
anybody
to
drink
and
enjoy
above
average
american
pale
ale
and
crammed
with
fresh
hop
flavor
very
tasty
and
sessionable
nice
a
relatively
mild
abv
with
a
strong
hop
taste
not
overdone
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
became
less
impressed
as
i
drank
it
as
the
hop
character
seemed
to
fade
it
could
be
past
its
prime
as
i
assume
the
hop
harvest
was
in
the
fall
so
that
is
at
least
7
months
ago
drinkability
even
though
this
beer
has
outlasted
its
prime
tasting
season
it
is
still
a
very
nice
brew
ive
got
to
try
it
sometimes
right
after
its
made
as
that
must
just
be
incredible
for
drinkability
its
hard
to
beat
this
one
its
a
smooth
good
tasting
easy
drinking
brew
that
would
be
good
anytime
as
pales
go
this
one
is
very
very
good
ill
look
for
more
this
is
a
wonderful
summer
brew
cheers
d
session
brew
at
its
finest
low
abv
and
quite
easy
drinking
smooth
and
subtle
fruit
notes
dont
scorch
the
palate
a
nice
summer
brew
if
you
ask
me
has
the
taste
of
an
aipa
citrus
and
pine
dominate
the
caramel
fades
into
herbal
notes
alcohol
isnt
very
strong
the
pine
settles
a
bit
and
some
persimmon
takes
over
finishes
a
bit
oily
a
little
crisp
22oz
is
about
enough
time
to
move
on
to
something
else
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
really
do
feel
that
this
would
have
better
been
cast
as
an
ipa
with
a
bit
more
malt
thrown
in
the
mash
tun
it
would
help
to
balance
the
ample
hops
that
seemed
to
have
been
used
here
on
the
other
hand
this
beer
would
not
be
quite
so
quaffable
at
an
ipas
alcohol
level
overall
a
very
impressive
supremely
rounded
softhop
ale
lots
of
flavor
but
not
knockyoudown
or
kickyouinthenuts
bitterness
kind
of
like
a
sleepy
lazy
summer
day
in
the
hammock
very
nice
worth
seeking
out
poured
this
beer
from
a
22oz
bomber
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
andor
i
could
find
it
in
a
six
pack
form
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
creamy
head
topping
it
off
it
does
not
have
much
aroma
a
slight
citrus
smell
is
all
i
picked
up
the
initial
flavor
is
a
tingling
hop
sensation
that
coats
my
tongue
but
not
at
all
overpowering
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
while
still
having
a
substantial
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
if
the
fresh
hops
are
what
makes
the
beer
so
smooth
but
this
is
a
beer
definitely
worth
trying
great
pale
ale
aroma
is
of
soft
floral
and
citrus
hops
the
dominant
aromas
but
not
overpowering
slight
sweetness
too
flavor
is
of
grapefruit
orange
rind
some
slight
gentle
pine
and
a
light
bready
malt
counterpoint
i
like
this
beer
easy
to
frink
it
has
a
nice
creaminess
but
is
interesting
without
being
so
complex
that
it
requires
a
lot
of
thought
one
of
the
better
apas
i
have
had
i
would
love
to
get
a
chance
to
try
it
fresh
all
in
all
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
id
have
no
problem
having
another
since
my
review
hop
trip
has
become
a
brew
available
locally
and
ive
been
buying
it
on
a
regular
basis
as
im
sipping
on
a
bottle
right
now
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
is
how
wonderful
the
fresh
hop
flavour
is
in
this
brew
ive
adjusted
my
rating
accordingly
their
website
has
some
cool
pictures
of
the
fresh
crystal
hops
being
shoveled
into
the
hopback
d
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
d
a
welcome
addition
to
deschutes
lineup
this
is
one
id
definitely
have
again
and
will
recommend
nice
flavor
a
balanced
apa
and
readily
available
as
of
november
2006
whats
not
to
like
d
the
unique
hop
flavor
alone
is
worth
the
purchase
of
hop
trip
low
bitterness
and
intense
flavor
make
for
a
rewarding
and
very
drinkable
treat
i
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
some
more
fresh
hopped
brews
this
time
of
year
d
the
fresh
hops
are
really
shine
in
this
ale
adding
a
fresh
zip
that
does
not
overpower
the
malt
body
a
well
made
beer
tons
of
citrus
and
pine
in
the
aroma
and
umm
a
subtle
soapy
hint
its
in
the
quaff
too
darn
it
still
the
floral
kicks
in
and
covers
the
soap
by
midbomber
sharp
crisp
and
dry
i
like
it
just
not
overwhelmed
or
even
impressed
by
it
would
not
work
hard
to
get
another
bomber
of
it
purchased
this
bomber
and
finishing
a
great
divide
fresh
hop
ale
i
was
surpisingly
disappointed
it
poured
a
light
caramel
color
with
moderate
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
and
light
lacing
down
my
glass
smell
was
decently
citrusy
and
hoppy
but
nothing
like
what
i
was
expecting
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
average
pale
ale
with
slight
bitterness
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
was
let
down
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
it
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
this
beer
had
a
slightly
hazy
amberred
color
with
a
2
finger
offwhite
head
of
densely
packed
bubbles
the
smell
was
excellent
much
like
a
strong
ipa
very
fruity
and
inviting
the
taste
began
moderately
fruity
and
bitter
followed
by
much
carbonation
and
a
quick
finish
starts
like
an
ipa
but
ends
like
a
pale
ale
mouthfeel
was
dominated
by
high
carbonation
and
a
mild
medium
not
too
lingering
dryness
overall
i
think
the
drinkability
was
exceptional
the
lower
abv
combined
with
the
lively
mouthfeel
and
taste
make
me
rate
this
a
5
good
stuff
when
i
opened
this
bottle
i
was
surprised
that
i
got
such
a
beautiful
smell
of
fresh
hops
nice
lacing
and
a
nice
orangeamber
color
the
first
taste
reminds
me
of
hops
grass
and
peaches
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
pleasant
i
preferred
this
over
great
divide
fresh
hop
by
far
the
low
abv
adds
to
the
drinkability
my
first
thought
was
to
go
back
to
the
store
and
buy
the
remaining
bottles
so
i
did
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
at
3
49
for
a
220z
it
was
a
really
good
deal
if
you
get
the
chance
try
this
one
with
the
low
abv
i
could
have
easily
had
another
but
only
bought
one
damn
overall
impression
very
nice
incredibly
balanced
and
drinkable
a
bit
different
than
some
of
the
other
fresh
hop
beers
ive
tried
but
i
will
certainly
be
looking
for
this
every
year
if
only
there
were
enough
fresh
hops
to
make
six
packs
good
drinkability
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
hop
character
is
not
overly
assertive
nicely
balanced
for
the
most
part
the
flavors
are
those
of
a
standard
pale
alestrong
hop
presence
with
extra
fresh
hints
of
pine
oil
and
it
has
a
nice
body
through
the
finish
that
offsets
some
of
the
hops
what
really
makes
this
beer
shine
is
its
mouthfeel
perhaps
this
is
where
its
youth
comes
out
as
it
has
a
softness
across
the
palate
that
adds
a
justright
light
touch
to
the
overall
character
of
the
brew
i
easily
finished
a
bomber
of
this
and
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
grab
another
one
very
creamy
mouthfeel
neither
thin
nor
cloying
an
excellent
pale
ale
pours
a
pretty
orangeamber
color
topped
by
an
inch
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
inviting
aroma
of
piney
lightly
fruity
hops
light
caramel
malt
and
a
whiff
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
palate
is
wellbalanced
with
the
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
complementing
the
tasty
assertive
hops
notes
of
pine
and
grapefruit
are
detectable
as
is
a
little
bit
of
maple
body
is
a
bit
lacking
in
carbonation
but
is
nevertheless
sturdy
enough
to
convey
the
ample
flavor
quite
well
if
this
were
available
fresh
yearround
id
drink
it
fairly
often
alas
its
a
onceayear
treat
that
appears
to
lose
its
punch
pretty
fast
grab
it
while
you
can
and
make
sure
its
fresh
tastes
like
oranges
drizzled
with
caramel
and
good
mint
sauce
stick
aftertaste
but
a
nice
lemongrass
and
ginger
flavor
helps
keep
the
mouthfeel
interesting
free
flowing
carbonation
also
break
up
the
honey
cake
aftertaste
herbal
grassy
and
very
medicinal
hop
aroma
with
mild
tropical
fruits
redorange
brick
color
intiially
solely
hop
accented
in
a
nice
way
until
the
beer
warms
and
butter
toffee
and

underneath
grass
resin
throughout
with
pine
on
the
finish
cool
fun
beer
thanks
deschutes
more
creative
beers
like
this
please
this
is
one
heck
of
an
apa
very
lovely
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
you
can
very
easy
to
drink
too
overall
tasty
stuff
deschutes
is
getting
a
nice
coverage
down
the
west
coast
these
days
and
i
pick
them
up
when
i
see
them
but
having
the
pleasure
of
being
further
north
over
new
years
than
usual
meant
that
i
came
across
this
rather
rare
brew
glad
i
picked
it
up
value
for
money
too
at
less
than
3
definitely
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
like
your
pale
ales
with
that
little
bit
extra
to
offer
the
pallet
oh
these
fresh
hop
ales
gotta
love
em
i
do
thats
for
sure
pours
a
rich
auburn
color
with
a
creamy
like
white
head
that
settles
slowly
leaving
a
sheet
of
lace
behindaromas
are
fresh
and
oh
so
piney
it
just
jumps
out
at
ya
the
citrus
is
there
as
well
beneath
the
pine
making
the
mouth
water
this
beer
slides
down
way
to
easy
if
this
was
on
tap
somewhere
near
me
i
would
camp
out
there
i
could
drink
all
night
and
be
satisfied
fresh
pineycitrusy
hop
over
top
of
lightly
sweet
malt
but
just
really
damn
fresh
tasting
thats
what
this
beer
and
other
fresh
hop
ales
are
about
i
would
say
great
divide
fresh
hop
has
a
slight
edge
but
this
is
a
winner
no
doubt
hoppedup
and
garagekegger
will
be
happy
when
i
present
them
each
with
a
bottle
for
sure
amber
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
very
hoppy
aroma
but
not
in
the
expected
chop
apa
kind
of
way
theres
some
citrus
quality
to
the
aroma
but
there
are
other
fruits
in
there
too
applepear
maybe
along
with
some
gentle
herbal
notes
the
flavors
are
of
mild
fruit
orange
tangerine
peach
macintosh
apple
medium
caramel
malt
and
the
smallest
touch
of
pine
resin
low
to
medium
bitterness
which
again
is
unlike
most
of
the
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
tried
a
welcome
change
of
pace
very
well
made
and
very
complex
remember
kids
this
isnt
an
ipa
yes
the
label
says
hop
trip
its
butterscotch
late
in
the
taste
im
not
impressed
nice
body
for
an
apa
didnt
know
how
to
rate
it
because
this
is
the
most
full
bodied
pale
i
have
ever
had
mixed
feelings
but
had
to
rate
it
high
as
it
was
not
only
thickish
but
had
a
very
creamy
feel
as
well
drinkable
but
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
good
stuffcharlatannov
20
and
the
pineapplemelon
flavors
are
more
noticable
in
the
taste
but
another
swallow
cures
that
the
beer
has
a
slight
carbonation
and
an
excellent
mouthfeel


i
think
this
is
a
superbly
drinkable
beer
and
i
didnt
want
to
put
it
down
this
is
probably
more
geared
toward
hops
fans
if
there
is
a
better
pale
ale
for
the
price
clue
me
in
finally
found
some
with
a
date
i
like
52915
and
bought
one
to
sample
into
the
spiegelau
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
on
top
of
a
deep
tangerine
body
hints
of
red
in
the
light
light
piney
aromas
hint
of
grapefruit
clean
and
subtle
with
a
hint
of
lemon
grass
or
saffron
nearly
perfect
for
a
pa
balance
is
the
word
on
flavor
light
grapefruit
rind
citrus
bitterness
on
the
front
mid
palate
has
a
nice
lightly
toasted
malt
base
super
clean
perfect
finish
like
a
cool
glass
of
lemonade
on
a
summers
day
this
may
be
my
summer
lawnmower
beer
hands

this

t
a

that
dries
out
with
a

bitterness
on
the
finish
m
medium

with
medium
levels
of

the
carbonation
is
very
creamy
and
soft
o
a
very
drinkable
american
pale
ale
with
character
excellent
pale
ale
with
a
great

thats
very
drinkable
too
bad
its
a
rarity
in

good

pretty

in
chilled

at
the
diller
room
in

with
thick
white

and
heavy
lacing
due
to
nitro
mild
smell
with
more
malt
than
hops
well
balanced
with
pronounced
hop
flavor
i
tend
to
prefer
bigger
beers
but
opted
for
this
as
it
was
available
on
nitro
i
like
it
on
nitro
at
the
brewpub
excellent
mouthfeel
and
so
easy
to
drink
taste
is
big
fresh
pale
malt
with
touches
of
pine
and
hemp
this
is
a
nice
and
clean
pale
ale
an
above
average
beer
although
there
are
others
i
prefer
in
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
beer
with
good
level
of
hops
could
definitely
have
a
couple
more
taste
is
big
fresh
pale
malt
with
touches
of
pine
and
hemp
this
is
a
nice
and
clean
pale
ale
an
above
average
beer
although
there
are
others
i
prefer
in
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
really
good
smooth
enough
hoppiness
to
notice
but
not
overpowering
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
very
nice
too
bad
its
only
a
seasonal
could
definitely
drink
this
one
year
round
good
smooth
beer
didnt
think
i
would
like
it
not
usually
my
type
of
beer
but
this
one
was
really
good
only
got
a
sample
before
it
sold
out
little
disappointed
would
have
liked
to
get
more
had
on
tap
at

just
outside

what
a
perfect
pale
ale
this
one
is
so
dialed
in
with
hops
and
malt
sweet
no
bitterness
and
full
in

absolute
delight
solid
example
of
the
style
but
not
impressed

revisit
again
someday

at
first
then
a
very

hoppy
taste
this
vibrant
and
not
overly
bitter
very
surprised
how
well
it
tastes
hard
to
say
this
but
better
than
sierra

excellent
excellent
beer
im
digging
this
well
done
this
would
be
a
good
starter
into
ipa
not
super

just
a
very
smooth
beer
very
good
example
of
a

balanced

a
must
have
pale
ale
overall
a
very
solid
drinkable
ale
from
deschutes
this
is
one
of
the
most
perfectly
balanced
beers
i
know
a
lucky
customer
can
snag
a
12pack
of
this
at
the
supermarket
for
as
cheap
as
12

but
usually
a
bit
more
making
it
in
seattle
the
best
beer
that
one
can
buy
in
terms
of
quality
to
price
point
significant

dissipates
to
a
enduring

around

edges
strong
and

lightly
toasted
is
prominent

but
not
citrusy
or

aromassaffron
and
taste
of
hops
balance
the
flavor
but
dont
dominate
one
of
my
atf
beers
which
i
buy
regularly
and
this
tasting
hasnt
changed
that
perception
a
bit
easy
drinking
and
a
crowd
pleaser
tastes
like
listerine
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
very
tasty
nwpa
highly
recommend
it
whoa

thats
good
stuff
to
me
this

overall
weird
as
it
might
sound
this
was
basically
what
i
was
expecting
a
very
pleasant
balanced
and
easydrinking
india
pale
ale
the
hops
has
strong
aromatic
and
flavor
characteristics
without
inducing
the
amount
of
bitterness
one
might
expect
of
an
ipa
just
a
smidge
on
the
sweet
side
but
i
still
love
it
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
one
overall
they
could
do
better
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
exceptional
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
very
dynamic

liked
the

hops

the

was
very

nice

less

than
i
typically
look
for
in

good

this
is
an
awesome

very

o
this
stuff
is
fantastic
had
a
6er
of
it
last
year
and
sought
out
a
case
this
year
overall
a
gotobeer
every
late
winterearly
spring
absolutely
love
it
and
love
the
labelname
gross
i
trusted
the
rating
but
wow
it
was
totally
off
for
me
at
least
tasted
like
cleaner
tried
it
on
tap
overall
hands
down
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
iv
had
it
has
all
the
fruity
hops
you
want
in
an
apa
but
also
has
a
wonderful
bready
backbone
that
carries
the
flavors
through
the
finish
i
like
my
pale
ales
to
be
a
subdued
version
of
a
juicy
ipa
and
thats
exactly
what
this
is
in
fact
this
is
basically
the
little
brother
of
fresh
squeeze
deschutes
has
been
gradually
rising
towards
the
top
as
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
since
they
started
distributing
in
my
state
about
a
year
ago
and
this
is
another
reason
why
an
amber
ale
white
head
and
good
clarity
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
slight
fruit
and
hop
undertone
the
taste
is
notably
better
mmgreat
balance
sweetness
malt
fruit
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
solidly
good
but
not
unlike
many
others
of
the
style
deschutes
just
keeps
getting
it
right
were
god
to
appear
to
a
human
and
ask
him
to
show
him
his
greatest
achievement
the
man
would
be
in
remiss
if
he
didnt
give
god
a
mug
of
50
degree
red
chair
nwpa
the
balance
in
this
brew
is
ridiculous
a
sweet
citrusy
hoppy
profile
gives
way
to
a
smooth
caramelbready
maltiness
that
then
just
as
quickly
lends
itself
back
into
a
crisp
piney
finish
that
lingers
while
reminding
you
of
the
malty
profile
it
just
impressed
upon
you
this
seriously
may
be
the
most
well
balanced
beer
ive
ever
tasted
ive
had
this
beer
for
the
past
four
years
before
finally
reviewing
it
it
is
simply
unmatched
in
balance
damned
near
a
perfect
beer
in
my
humble
beer
loving
opinion
cheers
overall
just
a
great
pale
ale
super
glad
i
tried
and
would
definitely
make
a
good
go
to
lowmid
abv
beer
for
light
session
drinking
and
i
dont
know
why
deschutes
doesnt
put
this
in
their
year
round
lineup
somehow
all
the
reviews
i
read
on
this
have
not
hit
the
note
except
one
the
taste
is
so
unique
you
will
only
know
it
when
you
drink
it
but
let
me
describe
it
for
you
the
best
i
can
ok
first
pear
apricot
and
cherry
hits
the
note
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
cherry
note
finish
but
dry
and
soothing
with
creamy
finish
spot
on
in
my
book
this
is
a
a
beer
got
to
get
it
every
season
great
job
deschutes
o
very
solid
pale
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
spectacular
poured
into

a
amber

color
with
a
two
finger
ivory
colored
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
half
a
finger
thick
for
duration
of
drink
heavy
lacing
that
does
not
disappear
s
citrus
wheat
notes
of
raspberry
and
bitter
hops
not
bready
at
all
t
initially
bitter
citrus
hops
followed
by
strong
wheat
aftertaste
f
moderate
carbonation
still
smooth
enough
to
drink
steadily
o
deliciously
brewed
i
give
a
4
5
to
another
superb
beer
from
deschutes
brewery
definitely
added
to
my
top
5
malt
then
bitter
nice
crisp
and
easy
after
taste
at
some
points
too
grassy
and
bitter
but
leaves
you
feeling
like
you
have
drank
to
much
rootbeer
overly
sweet
earthly
after
taste
o
this
is
a
new
favorite
pale
ale
i
will
be
picking
this
beer
up
every
year
extremely
good
rich
and
complex
pale
ale
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
color
aroma
and
taste
were
very
good
id
agree
with
the
outstandingworld
class
ratings
would
be
this
again
and
each
year
o
very
solid
offering
from
deschutes
highly
drinkable
even
sessionable
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
another
great
offering
from
deschutes
starts
off
very
similar
to
hop
trip
imo
as
it
warms
the
sweet
malts
kick
in
toning
down
the
hops
a
bit
very
drinkable
pale
ale
that
has
a
nice
hop
presence
balanced
with
a
sweet
juicy
malt
backbone
overall
big
flavor
perfectly
balanced
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
around
well
done
this
beer
to
me
is
perfectly
balanced
with
hops
present
without
being
overpowering
dangerously
drinkable
for
6
2
highly
recommended
v
good
value
nice
beer
not
sure
how
this
nwpa
is
different
than
the
retired
ipa
version
overall
a
rather
nice
red
ipa
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
brew
that
is
certainly
one
to
try
when
you
get
the
opportunity
fresh
as
can
be
this
2014
it
is
a
fantastic
and
underrated
pale
ale
o
im
glad
a
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
this
is
a
delicious
refreshing
and
crowdpleasing
winter
beer
it
might
be
the
best
ive
had
from
deschutes
o
maybe
not
my
favorite
but
another
solid
brew
from
deschutes
o
decent
but
not
a
go
to
pale
ale
for
me
i
have
some
others
from
wi
that
i
prefer
overall
a
pale
ale
on
the
hoppy
side
that
is
a
must
try
for
deschutes
fans
so
looking
forward
to
red
chair
again
this
winter
very
well
balanced
and
the
hoppiness
is
subdued
enough
that
my
non
hophead
friends
say
oh
this
is
pretty
good
one
of
my
goto
favorites
for
the
winter
and
spring
while
its
available
and
a
great
value
to
boot
so
i
can
buy
it
often
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
hops
really
good
apa
tasty
should
make
year
round
o
deschutes
seems
to
strive
for
balance
in
their
beers
rather
than
going
fullon
hoooops
like
other
breweries
especially
on
the
west
coast
i
do
love
hops
but
its
nice
to
have
apas
like
this
one
which
is
very
well
balanced
the
hops
are
there
but
there
is
a
really
great
malt
presence
too
the
flowery
and
piney
hops
come
on
first
then
the
sweet
bready
malts
take
over
the
flavors
wash
over
and
over
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
a
terrific
ale
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
very
good
red
ipa
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
from
one
of
the
better
breweries
but
still
a
decent
drink
awesome
the
first
drink
awesome
in
the
middle
and
awesome
at
the
end
there
nwpa
is
a
great
beer
shouldnt
be
surprised
from
deschutes
red
chair
is
epic
pours
a
pretty
mediumamber
in
color
with
almost
a
1finger
thick
offwhite
head
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
which
is
common
for
this
type
of
brew
the
aroma
is
of
light
sweet
bread
with
some
floral
hops
the
taste
has
more
going
on
with
some
citrus
zest
in
the
mix
as
well
great
taste
but
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
stays
around
a
bit
does
take
about
half
the
drink
to
get
used
to
it
overall
great
taste
and
even
better
with
a
less
hoppy
finish
i
did
drink
the
whole
glass
as
wouldnt
be
the
case
if
it
was
a
i
p
a
final
word
another
highly
recommended
beer
from
deschutes
brewery
this
beer
is
for
those
of
you
that
tried
mirror
pond
but
thought
it
too
malty
not
challengingpotent
enough
or
simply
that
you
prefer
a
stronger
hop
character
over
a
maltier
one
this
beer
is
never
too
hoppy
though
and
isnt
for
hopheads
as
it
is
still
superbly
balanced
and
rich
onice
pa
hop
finish
fair
drinker
at
6
2
abv
o
well
made
apa
with
little
bittering
hops
as
such
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
nice
could
be
fresh
could
be
less
so
but
than
again
i
am
not
sure
what
deschutes
bb
policy
is
o
a
nice
western
ipa
with
very
little
hoppy
aftertaste
another
solid
beer
from
deschutes
i
just
wish
they
were
easier
to
find
here
in
northern
il
my
local
store
doesnt
carry
many
of
them
preferring
to
order
more
from
wisconsin
brewers
instead
o
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
really
like
deschutes
brewery
this
is
another
great
beer
that
they
brew
i
recommend
it
highly
a
superb
pale
ale
with
wonderful
drinkability
and
an
ideal
session
ale
the
citrus
punch
of
a
big
ipa
minus
the
onedimensional
hop
sledgehammer
seven
select
european
and
domestic
malts
round
out
the
edges
for
a
complex
coppercolored
brew
like
its
namesake
ski
lift
its
an
insiders
ride
to
fresh
thrills
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
like
a
pale
ale
should
be
d
this
is
an
absolutely
stellar
american
pale
ale
equal
parts
hops
and
malt
i
dont
have
a
single
bad
thing
to
say
about
this
brew
this
one
ends
up
being
much
more
than
the
sum
of
its
glorious
parts
if
this
were
a
year
round
offering
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
with
regularity
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
a
bounty
of
hop
flavoring
that
finishes
a
touch
dusty
and
vegetative
but
otherwise
solid
a
pale
i
could
throw
back
in
quantity
quite
effortlessly
overall
i
cant
find
anything
to
criticize
about
this
beer
i
am
amazed
that
this
beer
has
a
60
ibu
rating
as
the
hops
are
so
well
balanced
with
the
malt
outstanding
and
bordering
on
world
class
o
i
bought
one
i
think
im
going
to
buy
a
six
pack
its
enjoyable
overall
my
favorite
pale
ale
and
a
great
balanced
example
of
the
style
o
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
and
even
though
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
than
i
would
normally
recommend
this
feels
like
a
sessionable
brew
in
my
opinion
nice
flavors
that
have
some
aspects
of
an
amber
but
more
of
a
pale
ale
very
enjoyable

a
hands
down
the
best
pale
ale
of
all
i
have
tasted
this
starts
out
with
a
wonderful
aroma
the
copper
color
is
darker
than
most
pas
i
have
experienced
may
not
be
a
fair
comparison
since
the
named
it
nwpa
it
certainly
favors
the
taste
of
those
living
from
oregon
northstarts
great
and
finishes
even
better
it
was
by
a
complete
fluke
i
even
bought
it
a
person
at
working
stocking
the
beer
at
safeway
in
ballard
suggested
it
i
was
smart
enough
to
listen
overall
i
regularly
drink
ipas
but
have
decided
to
branch
out
red
chair
has
a
good
amount
of
depth
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
even
my
ipa
brothers
this
is
a
wellrounded
quality
tasting
beer
made
with
love
and
given
a
cool
fitting
name
o
wow
what
a
great
beer
perfectly
drinkable
with
incredibly
complimentary
balance
between
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
the
taste
is
excellent
very
fruity
with
subtle
mix
of
orange
notes
in
the
hops
with
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
mild
caramel
flavors
from
the
malt
all
blending
in
a
way
that
nothing
is
out
of
balance
yet
the
sum
of
the
parts
is
really
interesting
the
taste
of
the
yeast
adds
a
slight
hint
of
tangy
sweet
apple
skin
with
a
mild
toasted
malt
element
and
light
herbal
flavor
in
the
finish
4
25
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
about
equally
in
the
bottle
as
the
draft
version
the
only
exception
is
the
hops
seemed
more
aromatic
in
the
draft
but
the
overall
enjoyment
is
the
same
4
o
at
first
it
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
bodied
more
citrus
oriented
sierra
nevada
northern
hemisphere
which
is
high
praise
for
me
as
i
continued
to
taste
this
pale
ale
leans
more
toward
an
amber
like
a
troegs
nugget
nectar
again
pretty
high
praise
bottom
line
is
that
for
6
2
abv
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
feel
and
im
glad
it
made
it
to
southcentral
pa
starting
this
week
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
bordering
on
rust
almost
with
a
decent
cap
of
foam
which
was
just
sticky
enough
to
leave
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
signals
that
this
is
indeed
a
hoppy
ale
from
the
northwest
the
citrus
orange
mostly
and
floral
character
are
sewn
together
beautifully
a
very
subtle
malt
note
lingers
in
the
background
this
theme
continues
on
the
palate
orange
grapefruit
and
floral
hoppiness
scrub
the
palate
and
leave
a
faint
oily
residue
of
hops
malt
sweetness
isnt
a
major
player
here
but
there
is
enough
to
prevent
this
from
being
a
one
trick
pony
nicely
done
poured
dark
amber
color
slightly
hazy
very
thick
foamy
head
with
large
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
strong
citrus
smell
can
also
pick
out
pine
maybe
grapefruit
hop
forward
tastes
that
mellows
to
a
more
malty
smooth
presence
still
retains
the
bitter
aftertaste
i
love
about
pale
ales
and
ipas
strong
citrus
and
pine
taste
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
for
some
reason
i
keep
on
thinking
cherries
as
well
after
taking
a
drink
excellent
smooth
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
in
multiples
on
a
nice
spring
day
o
im
a
little
disappointed
that
i
couldnt
find
this
a
little
fresher
because
im
certain
that
im
missing
out
on
some
important
fresh
hop
flavor
that
would
have
surely
kicked
up
my
taste
score
a
notch
with
that
being
said
every
bit
of
me
enjoyed
this
brew
regardless
its
super
easy
drinking
with
a
ton
of
great
flavor
deschutes
scores
again
it
has
a
6
2
abv
and
i
did
catch
a
slight
buzz
after
downing
the
first
two
after
completing
a
6
mile
mountain
hike
its
worth
checking
out
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
but
carbonation
is
well
balanced
a
tiny
bit
of
malty
thickness
at
the
end
o
delicious
and
great
drinkability
i
drank
this
too
fast
got
this
in
a
create
your
own
6
pack
to
try
it
out
definitely
getting
a
6
of
it
next
time
the
verdict
delicious
complex
well
balanced
and
tasty
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
more
please
overall
this
is
a
killer
beer
light
smooth
flavorful
and
soooo
easy
to
drink
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
you
can
get
your
hop
fix
with
this
and
not
get
palate
wrecked
at
all
world
class
and
unique
nothing
else
ive
had
quite
tastes
like
this
one
this
is
subtler
than
those
big
aggressive
amber
ales
its
got
a
decent
malt
body
and
has
more
subtle
citric
hops
although
dont
get
me
wrong
its
quite
hoppy
but
its
big
bodied
id
place
it
close
to
arrogant
bastard
and
the
american
strong
ale
genre
good
tasty
beer
all
around
was
through
a
tasting
event
and
this
was
probably
my
favorite
beer
someone
could
have
everyday
enjoyable
semi
strong
pale
ale
very
nice
color
perhaps
a
little
deficient
on
the
carbonation
taste
reminiscent
of
english
bass
ale
in
all
regards
a
pleasingly
bitter
and
well
constructed
ale
at
a
reasonable
price
lovely
to
come
home
to
at
the
end
of
a
hard
days
skiing
in
tahoe
pours
a
dark
amber
orange
hue
with
a
creamy
three
finger
head
right
up
to
the
brim
and
lacing
everywhere
quite
a
nice
lookerthe
smell
is
light
citrusa
touch
of
subtle
pine
and
light
maltsthe
mouthfeel
is
light
yet
creamy
and
moderately
carbonated
with
tastes
of
nice
citrustangerinepale
malts
and
finished
a
subtle
floral
bitterness
and
overall
its
nice
and
sessionable
and
something
u
want
when
you
dont
want
a
smack
load
of
hops
and
id
love
to
have
a
pint
of
this
off
tap
cheers
this
ale
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
copper
color
with
a
very
slight
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
complex
with
lots
of
malt
and
hops
the
flavor
is
just
as
rich
and
complex
very
impressive
for
a
seemingly
simple
apa
i
wish
id
have
bought
more
than
just
a
single
of
this
one
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
highly
recommend
j
poured
a
cloudy
amber
orange
without
any
head
to
speak
of
and
some
slight
bubbles
coming
up
not
the
best
looking
pale
ale
ive
seen
but
its
pretty
nice
scent
begins
with
a
big
hit
of
orange
zest
from
centennial
hops
mingling
with
some
pine
resin
and
slight
grapefruit
along
with
a
nice
pleasant
malty
sweetness
and
some
nice
grassy
aromas
quite
appetizing
very
well
done
taste
begins
with
orange
sweetness
a
bit
of
pine
resin
and
some
nice
caramel
malt
pine
resin
comes
out
more
in
the
middle
overpowering
the
orange
and
caramel
sweetness
the
finish
returns
to
the
caramel
and
orange
but
also
adds
a
good
hit
of
bitter
citrus
pith
and
pine
resin
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
a
good
robust
but
not
overpowering
flavor
profile
complex
but
accessible
very
well
done
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
upfront
and
a
smooth
feel
in
the
middle
and
finish
very
easy
to
drink
as
a
result
expertly
done
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
it
highlights
citrus
and
pine
forward
hops
without
the
high
bitterness
of
an
ipa
balances
them
with
some
nice
sweet
malt
and
combines
that
flavor
with
an
excellent
aroma
and
mouthfeel
another
winner
from
deschutes
this
is
the
third
style
brew
i
have
had
from
dechutes
each
one
has
become
an
automatic
favorite
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
the
feel
is
the
best
aspect
in
this
beer
its
rich
with
a
creamy
thickness
that
doesnt
exceed
its
medium
body
and
its
completely
crisp
to
boot
silky
creaminess
gives
way
to
sweetness
that
cuts
through
a
dry
edge
it
begins
to
take
adding
depth
to
the
overall
feel
the
key
to
keeping
it
together
is
really
that
it
stays
so
crisp
all
the
while
enjoyed
16
oz
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
another
product
of
me
watching
their
beer
board
like
a
hawk
for
stuff
you
cannot
yet
find
in
stores
here
keep
em
coming
guys
a
light
bronze
colored
brew
just
a
notch
above
dark
gold
with
around
an
inch
of
beige
head
aroma
a
pleasing
blend
of
rich
crystal
malts
bubblegum
and
red
berry
fruit
esters
and
fresh
citrus
zest
quite
balanced
although
the
citrus
is
probably
the
main
component
that
jumps
out
on
the
palate
i
again
get
considerable
citrus
grapefruit
mandarin
lemon
and
lime
zestjuices
along
with
orchard
fruit
peach
white
grape
baby
aspirin
and
a
mellow
brown
sugar
malty
backbone
some
booze
winks
through
from
time
to
time
and
the
hops
morph
a
bit
from
citrus
to
celery
stalk
body
and
mouthfeel
are
right
on
point
for
the
style
more
chew
than
a
lager
but
about
the
same
degree
of
carbonation
i
might
ratchet
this
latter
element
down
a
notch
or
two
has
much
of
the
cascade
hop
character
of
its
stablemate
and
fellow
pale
ale
mirror
pond
but
with
more
west
coast
citrus
flavors
layered
on
and
a
higher
abv
a
nice
enough
jaunt
the
mellow
sweet
malts
let
the
hops
shine
through
it
would
be
great
to
crush
a
sixpack
or
two
with
a
few
buddies
i
dont
recall
having
a
beer
that
smells
so
much
of
fresh
hops
the
bitterness
is
just
a
touch
more
than
i
prefer
but
a
great
brew
the
more
of
it
i
drink
the
more
hollow
it
tastes
the
nose
is
citrusy
and
sweet
and
very
much
what
i
get
on
the
taste
buds
too
its
almost
sweet
and
creamy
and
like
biting
into
a
juicy
orange
but
the
backend
is
resinous
and
bitter
and
lingers
with
a
bit
of
dryness
very
wellbalanced
and
really
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
and
could
go
through
many
a
six
pack
body
feels
a
little
watery
and
undercarbonated
overall
a
very
good
apa
that
displays
good
hop
character
of
its
home
region
you
can
really
taste
the
floral
and
piney
flavors
of
the
hops
change
as
the
drink
progresses
o
another
delicious
hoppy
beer
from
deschutes
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
this
is
a
good
pa
but
the
hops
used
by
deschutes
bravo
i
think
are
not
my
favorite
o
i
really
feel
like
deschutes
has
done
an
excellent
job
presenting
well
integrated
malt
and
hop
flavors
in
this
beer
perfectly
balanced
quite
flavorful
and
immediately
approachable
this
in
my
book
is
exactly
what
an
apa
should
be
deschutes
does
a
nice
job
of
representing
the
region
in
ale
form
but
if
its
didnt
boast
its
origins
i
would
have
suspected
any
brewery
in
american
could
have
made
such
a
beer
thats
caught
somewhere
between
americanstyle
amber
ale
and
pale
ale
o
red
chair
is
delicious
i
havent
had
many
from
deschutes
but
im
getting
the
feel
for
their
texture
as
i
feel
its
the
most
important
part
of
any
great
ale
red
chair
has
loads
of
class
to
it
and
is
a
perfect
january
ipa
id
drink
this
one
any
day
a
must
try
o
amazingly
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
could
also
become
a
great
session
beer
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
very
soon
another
winner
from
what
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
most
favorite
breweries
very
nice
pale
ale
right
here
the
craftsmanship
really
sells
this
beer
for
me
the
aftertaste
is
more
like
an
ipa
all
around
this
is
a
major
winner
this
is
an
oldschool
wellcrafted
pale
ale
terrific
balance
lots
of
flavor
and
it
doesnt
ruin
your
palate
a
good
introductory
beer
to
craft
newbies
overall
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
tasty
o
a
lot
of
pale
ales
fight
between
hoppy
and
malts
and
this
one
is
clearly
leaning
toward
malt
a
unique
sweetness
with
some
bitterness
for
a
pa
and
worth
a
taster
or
glass
not
sure
if
i
would
ever
buy
more
than
that
for
this
one
a
moderate
pour
yields
an
inch
of
frothy
eggshellwhite
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
before
resolving
almost
completely
scant
patches
of
bubbles
linger
to
decorate
the
surface
as
wispy
trails
lace
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
varied
citrusy
hops
and
a
malty
caramel
background
some
orange
up
front
with
balanced
toffee
in
the
rear
not
aggressive
not
underwhelming
but
balanced
and
reasonably
complex
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
nice
malt
component
playing
second
fiddle
to
fresh
citrusy
hops
some
orange
pine
and
lemon
zest
meld
with
caramel
toffee
and
subtle
notes
of
brown
sugar
in
a
very
drinkable
manner
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
resinous
finish
the
carbonation
level
is
appropriate
for
this
style
and
does
well
to
liven
the
beer
overall
while
there
may
be
pales
out
there
that
fit
a
specific
flavor
profile
or
showcase
a
different
ingredient
better
the
red
chair
offers
a
surprisingly
refreshing
degree
of
balance
and
quality
in
a
beer
that
does
not
decimate
a
single
population
of
taste
buds
the
substantial
malt
background
makes
it
an
excellent
choice
for
the
colder
months
and
the
superb
drinkabilityaffordability
is
why
i
return
to
it
by
the
case
every
year
clear
golden
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
but
leaves
a
lot
of
nice
lacing
hoppy
with
a
few
piney
notes
very
smooth
and
full
flavor
the
hops
is
not
overpowering
some
citrus
a
little
bitter
after
taste
but
not
unpleasant
the
mouth
feel
is
clean
with
some
dryness
that
comes
on
after
you
swallow
overall
one
of
the
smoothest
ipas
i
have
had
if
you
are
looking
for
an
ipa
that
wont
knock
you
out
with
the
hops
and
still
has
outstanding
flavor
this
is
the
one
sorry
for
clipped
writingdone
on
phone
gorgeous
amber
color
with
red
tint
a
quarter
inch
of
moderately
sized
off
white
foam
bubbles
good
clarity
i
get
a
gentle
amount
of
piney
hops
and
doughy
pale
malt
in
the
nose
the
front
of
the
palate
is
doughy
light
malt
and
then
a
nudge
of
piney
hops
takes
gently
over
at
the
fade
and
then
back
to
the
bready
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouth
gives
a
bit
of
prickliness
from
the
hops
and
feels
well
balanced
and
is
very
prolific
for
a
beer
with
so
much
subtlety
o
i
love
this
pale
ale
juicy
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
beer
straddling
the
fence
between
an
american
pale
ale
and
an
american
ipa
o
got
is
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
this
is
my
first
deschutes
beer
very
impressed
and
has
some
flavors
in
it
that
i
havent
had
in
a
pale
ale
i
hear
deschutes
is
coming
to
michigan
this
year
and
i
am
very
excited
to
try
their
other
offerings
overall
a
great
sessionable
pale
ale
that
i
would
gladly
enjoy
again
a
nice
drinking
and
approachable
brew
not
as
perfect
as
hop
trip
from
their
bond
series
but
worthy
of
the
ratings
bestowed
by
the
bros
and
the
ba
community
very
tasty
beer
here
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
pleasing
pale
ales
ive
had
its
not
the
most
bitter
and
yet
it
has
a
very
appetizing
hop
characteristic
which
leaves
you
wanting
more
atmosphere
is
really
nice
nice
head
that
never
really
dissipates
thick
persistent
lacing
nose
is
piney
with
a
fine
balance
nutty
sweet
and
citrus
components
very
hoppy
and
biting
some
bitter
nutty
components
and
bittersweet
citrus
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
just
hoppy
enough
to
match
my
taste
buds
but
smooth
overall
nice
alternate
pale
ale
that
would
be
a
great
introduction
for
some
to
craft
beers
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
describe
this
as
flabby
it
has
a
nice
balance
and
does
what
it
says
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
three
finger
off
white
head
good
amount
of
carbonation
coming
off
the
glass
smells
of
northwest
pacific
hops
like
the
title
suggests
citrus
notes
like
grapefruit
tangerine
and
mango
also
a
good
amount
of
pine
a
hefty
dose
of
carmel
malts
and
breadiness
sweeten
the
aroma
and
stay
true
to
what
the
beer
description
suggests
a
well
balanced
american
pale
ale
taste
starts
with
some
nice
hoppy
flavors
get
grapefruit
and
orange
almost
like
a
marmalade
the
middle
brings
a
big
malt
profile
to
go
with
the
hops
get
some
grains
breadiness
and
carmel
sweetness
maybe
get
a
belgianlike
malt
in
there
too
this
balances
the
beer
in
a
really
nice
way
the
finish
brings
a
lot
of
pine
that
gives
the
beer
a
resinous
quality
as
well
as
more
grapefruit
marmalade
floral
esters
carmel
spiciness
and
breadiness
light
medium
body
with
a
pretty
creamy
smooth
and
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
that
lives
up
to
what
it
says
it
will
be
in
the
world
of
american
pale
ales
nowadays
it
is
nothing
to
ride
home
about
however
its
great
balance
stands
it
out
from
a
lot
of
the
hoppy
onesided
american
pale
ales
that
are
being
produced
today
wonderfully
easy
beer
to
drink
with
complimentary
sweet
flavors
the
bouquet
could
be
bigger
but
the
palate
certainly
delivers
o
overall
despite
the
labels
claim
this
does
deliver
a
good
dose
of
hops
while
still
maintaining
sessionability
woodsy
everygreenspruce
like
feel
is
perfect
for
sipping
on
that
red
chair
at
the
cabin
in
the
great
northwest
woods
a
solid
and
extremely
smooth
apa
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
overall
really
a
nice
and
flavorful
beer
smooth
extremely
drinkable
and
plenty
of
good
flavor
nice
transition
from
semisweet
to
slightly
bitter
and
dry
begging
the
next
sip
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
nearly
sessionable
at
6
2
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
ill
take
another
please
very
malty
pale
ale
but
that
not
necessarily
bad
its
just
tastes
a
little
more
like
a
hoppy
red
then
it
does
a
pale
all
in
all
still
pretty
damn
good
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
smooth
enjoyable
drinking
brew
one
that
i
could
enjoy
without
worrying
about
any
noticeable
defects
on
the
other
hand
the
lack
of
a
big
hop
presence
or
intense
flavors
leaves
it
behind
some
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
a
very
good
north
western
pale
ale
that
i
would
gladly
drink
on
a
red
chair
on
the
ski
slopes
in
oregon
or
in
a
swamp
located
in
the
florida
everglades
it
doesnt
matter
a
session
beer
a
the
way
medium
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
drinkable
but
pretty
mild
overall
and
frankly
quite
forgettable
this
bottle
was
before
the
drink
by
date
but
id
like
to
give
it
another
go
with
one
thats
less
than
a
month
old
copper
color
very
malty
for
being
labeled
a
pale
ale
almost
sweet
but
just
enough
of
a
hop
balance
to
pull
it
back
from
the
edge
the
body
almost
crosses
thew
line
into
redamber
ale
territory
the
aroma
strikes
a
nice
balance
of
maltiness
and
the
floralcitrus
notes
of
the
hops
a
very
nice
beer
o
really
good
brew
overall
it
was
far
from
disgusting
and
easy
enough
to
put
away
but
after
enjoying
mirror
mirror
i
dont
understand
why
this
has
a
higher
rating
far
from
a
tasty
pale
ale
o
decent
apa
a
little
more
bitterness
and
a
little
less
sweet
malt
would
be
better
but
its
not
bad
are
you
kidding
me
this
brew
runs
the
gamut
of
being
a
lawnmower
beer
to
a
winter
warmer
just
the
right
balance
of
malt
and
hops
wish
it
wasnt
a
seasonal
it
is
in
wi
i
love
it
plan
on
buying
it
in
copious
quantities
when
available
overall
a
great
american
pale
ale
with
good
hop
presence
and
a
great
balance
of
malts
my
first
beer
from
deschutes
and
definitely
not
my
last
o
an
excellent
easy
drinking
pale
ale
superb
balance
and
flavor
overall
of
of
my
first
drinks
that
got
me
into
appreciating
beer
and
over
the
past
few
years
its
always
nice
to
see
it
show
up
again
i
think
this
years
batch
is
a
tad
better
than
last
years
d
balance
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
refreshing
and
highly
quaffable
a
solid
brew
and
glad
i
could
secure
one
here
in
pa
o
deschutes
shines
again
seriously
these
guys
know
whats
up
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pale
ales
ive
had
no
offense
fff
youre
still
1
in
my
heart
but
seriously
get
this
if
you
see
it
for
the
price
its
like
youre
stealing
64
i
think
this
one
tops
inversion
for
me
a
toned
down
version
with
a
better
balance
heres
an
apa
that
beats
out
its
own
ipa
in
my
book
very
malt
forward
pale
ale
even
with
the
use
of
american
hops
this
tastes
like
an
english
pale
ale
meh
why
does
this
have
such
good
ratings
overall
a
well
crafted
nwpa
by
deschutes
nice
blend
of
malts
and
hops
makes
this
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
its
in
season
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
someone
relatively
new
to
craft
beer
and
still
uneasy
with
hop
forward
ipas
this
beer
is
somewhat
of
a
hybrid
between
an
easy
drinking
american
pale
ale
think
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
and
a
more
complex
ipa
it
has
a
nice
malty
backbone
and
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
allow
for
easy
drinking
while
the
burst
of
aromatic
hops
pine
grapefruit
give
it
a
great
deal
of
depth
it
has
a
decent
head
and
is
a
nice
cloudy
burnt
orange
not
a
ton
of
a
carbonation
and
a
longlasting
almost
sticky
aftertaste
a
good
well
made
beer
so
drinkable
i
think
we
got
some
old
crap
last
summer
when
this
was
introduced
tp
missouri
last
summer
this
will
be
in
the
hot
weather
rotation
if
i
can
get
this
fresh
o
definitely
an
impressive
and
unassuming
brew
they
nailed
it
in
terms
of
a
brew
thats
just
hoppy
enough
to
bring
out
some
flavour
but
not
so
much
that
it
will
scare
off
the
masses
well
played
good
brew
it
looks
good
and
laces
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
the
smell
doesnt
jump
out
as
much
as
some
but
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
fine
little
apa
are
great
this
will
be
how
i
get
newcomers
onto
the
ipa
bandwagon
very
balanced
while
allowing
for
the
separate
flavors
to
be
tasted
both
malts
and
hops
have
a
role
to
play
and
they
do
it
well
i
would
drink
again
the
dechutes
red
chair
was
more
of
a
redamber
ale
than
a
apa
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
thin
white
head
that
did
not
leave
much
lace
the
scent
was
malty
and
on
the
sweeter
side
there
was
not
much
presence
of
hops
the
taste
to
me
was
a
amberish
type
beer
not
much
bitterness
but
a
good
sweet
malt
base
with
hints
of
caramel
the
mouthfee
was
medium
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
its
a
fine
amber
ale
if
im
judging
this
as
a
apa
then
it
was
dissappointing
i
was
expecting
a
hopped
up
red
i
dont
know
why
i
was
surprised
by
this
being
deschutes
and
all
great
pale
ale
with
an
inviting
sweet
aroma
and
taste
to
it
a
very
nice
pale
ale
tasty
and
refreshing
all
the
way
down
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
quite
sessionable
overallthis
brew
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
cool
spring
evenings
in
the
high
desert
the
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
to
give
ones
taste
buds
a
pleasurable
experience
enjoy
this
brew
o
easy
to
drink
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
but
plenty
of
flavor
to
go
around
i
really
like
the
fruity
esters
and
subtly
malty
sweetness
unique
pale
ale
quite
sweet
and
fruity
and
delicious
really
happy
for
the
balance
on
the
finish
though
overall
quite
a
tasty
choice
cheers
an
awesome
beer
perfect
for
those
cool
damp
winter
days
in
the
pacnw
or
those
cool
damp
spring
days
here
in
minnesota
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
fairly
low
carbonation
levels
for
its
weight
the
result
is
a
beer
thats
slightly
more
heavyfeeling
than
it
should
be
also
slightly
stagnant
on
the
palate
though
it
still
flows
well
enough
due
to
the
bitterness
level
closes
semidry
with
fairly
substantial
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
overall
really
enjoy
this
one
this
is
one
i
make
an
effort
to
pick
up
when
its
available
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
highly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
this
reminds
me
so
vividly
of
the
spices
and
aromas
that
go
with
autumn
yet
it
seems
to
work
so
well
right
now
during
a
chilly
night
on
the
first
day
of
spring
in
a
way
i
dont
see
how
this
wouldnt
work
for
any
season
really
its
nicely
refreshing
and
flavorful
with
lots
of
aspects
that
are
present
in
variations
of
pale
ales
yet
come
together
nicely
in
a
balanced
manner
fans
of
deschutes
dont
pass
this
by
personally
id
take
this
over
a
mirror
pond
or
even
most
winter
warmers
available
on
the
market
any
day
o
a
good
pale
ale
didnt
notice
this
was
6
2
at
all
probably
would
pair
well
with
steaks
or
burgers
on
the
grille
o
this
is
a
world
class
pale
ale
bursting
with
tropical
hop
flavor
nicely
balanced
with
a
very
flavorful
malt
profile
o
this
beer
surprised
me
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
more
hop
forward
but
it
ended
up
being
a
sweeter
pale
ale
for
me
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
as
i
like
my
pale
ales
to
be
more
hoppy
but
it
was
a
good
value
at
10
a
six
pack
ill
probably
revisit
this
next
year
o
in
my
eyes
this
is
a
red
ale
and
for
a
red
ale
its
exceptional
it
has
the
strong
hop
profile
to
complement
the
lingering
caramel
malt
its
between
this
and
lakefront
fixed
gear
for
my
fav
reds
thx
o
definitely
a
good
beer
it
might
just
be
be
but
this
almost
seems
more
like
an
american
amber
than
a
pale
but
either
way
this
is
a
solid
beer
this
one
is
a
really
tasty
brew
that
i
could
definitely
session
kudos
to
deschutes
a
new
brewery
in
the
chicago
area
and
one
i
have
heard
great
things
about
o
malty
pa
with
a
citrus
flavor
and
a
weak
but
nice
aroma
more
hops
please
terrific
stuff
serving
type
12oz
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
red
with
minimal
white
head
heavy
lacing
hangs
around
on
the
glass
a
big
caramel
malt
profile
is
immediately
present
in
the
aroma
with
firm
bitter
notes
pine
and
graham
cracker
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
sweet
maltiness
that
is
quickly
joined
by
earthy
and
herbal
hop
notes
the
bitterness
is
light
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
overall
a
decent
little
pale
ale
that
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
o
i
love
the
hops
flavor
but
i
feel
there
is
too
much
malt
in
the
backbone
i
only
got
an
individual
bottle
maybe
it
is
just
the
particular
batch
i
got
because
this
beer
rates
very
well
here
maybe
it
is
just
not
to
my
palate
i
assume
that
is
the
case
deschutes
makes
awesome
beers
overall
a
simply
perfect
pale
ale
that
im
of
so
grateful
to
have
tried
if
i
lived
in
the
area
id
drink
this
as
fresh
from
the
tap
as
possible
i
cannot
remember
a
pale
ale
with
so
much
attractive
pronounced
goodness
but
still
keeping
a
bluecollar
stature
and
humbleness
simply
love
this
beer
o
balance
its
all
there
malts
hops
sweetness
bitterness
none
of
those
overpowers
the
other
great
job
by
deschutes
its
a
good
thing
this
a
seasonal
because
otherwise
this
6
2
abv
beer
might
be
my
session
beer
o
overall
great
pale
ale
with
a
best
by
date
a
month
away
im
sure
im
a
few
months
post
bottling
on
this
one
but
i
love
it
would
love
to
try
uber
fresh
but
right
now
hits
the
spot
great
malt
heavy
pale
ale
with
a
nice
hopping
to
tame
the
malts
great
deschutes
flavor
profile
tastes
like
a
stream
in
nature
a
top
pale
ale
orefreshing
smooth
and
complex
a
fantastic
quaff
o
something
offputting
with
this
beer
malt
profile
is
odd
and
dominates
whatever
hops
are
there
for
being
on
bottle
date
life
support
theres
still
a
hell
of
lot
to
like
about
this
flavors
are
soft
but
everything
melds
nicely
a
drinkable
and
flavorful
pale
taste
zesty
up
front
some
citrus
hop
bite
delicious
fruity
bouquet
apricot
apple
orange
sweet
malty
breadiness
finishes
nicely
malty
with
some
herbal
green
tea
and
fruity
hopiness
a
fantastic
pale
ale
shows
some
great
malt
layers
yet
still
very
apa
in
its
lush
hop
profile
very
drinkable
the
beer
i
wanna
drink
all
spring
summer
oreminded
me
of
magic
hat

with
a
tastier
hop
backbone
i
may
try
a
tap
with
the
right
meale
g
barbecued
chicken
o
nice
overall
beer
really
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
would
be
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
day
but
im
still
enjoying
it
in
bitter
cold
of
february
o
very
good
beer
o
very
good
exceptional
even
personally
i
find
it
runs
a
bit
malt
heavy
but
i
expect
this
from
deschutes
id
be
very
interested
in
trying
this
fresh
overall
highly
enjoyable
even
considering
the
sweetness
i
would
be
happy
if
more
apas
were
similar
to
this
level
of
hopping
this
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
keeping
in
stock
and
serving
to
friends
this
is
a
decent
apa
not
my
favorite
but
very
flavorful
i
will
pick
up
a
6
or
2
every
year
when
in
comes
out
give
it
a
go
if
you
get
deschutes

this
beer
is
less

forceful
than
your
typical

coaster
like
snpa
the
malt
body
is
robust
and
comforting
but
does
not
tower
over
the
flavorful
hops
and
esters
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
if
you
appreciate

in

medium

with

overall
not
bad
at
all
a
wellput

apa
that
straddles
the
line
with
the
ipa
its
got
the
balance
i
like
in
my
pale
ales
but
shows
its
pacific
northwest
roots
by
giving
my
palate
a
punch
on
the
arm
so
to
speak
while
its
nice
that
they
are
distributing
to
chicago
easy
to
drive
down
to
get
it
for
me
being
in
wisconsin
i
think
i
would
rather
have
alpha
king
if
i
want
a
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
it
does
what
this
beer
does
but
quite
a
bit
better
and
i
can
still
get
it
in
wisconsin
otherwise
for
the
style
its
a
nicely
done
effort
by
deschutes
4
mouthfeel
is
a
good
carbonation
not
sticky
not
heavy
overall
its
probably
my
second
favorite
pale
ale
and
its
nearly
my
favorite
dont
miss
it
there
is
definitely
a
very
strong
malt
presence
for
an
apa
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
bready
taste
but
i
think
this
beer
could
be
more
well
balanced
overall
im
slightly
disappointed
because
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
hype
when
deschutes
started
distributing
to
illinois
but
i
think
black
butte
it
their
only
beer
that
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
red
chair
is
a
decent
apa
has
some
unique
characteristics
but
i
would
not
choose
it
over
other
apas
at
a
similar
price
point
such
as
dales
pale
ale
o
i
really
like
the
malt
profile
on
this
one
compliments
the
restrained
hops
nicely
i
find
red
chairs
in
my
living
room
to
be
a
bit
gaudy
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
needles
grapefruit
zest
orange
peel
a
touch
of
tangerine
and
a
hint
of
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
slightly
rindier
than
before
but
still
pretty
bright
and
enjoyable
a
bit
of
grass
is
tossed
in
for
good
measure
thee
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
deschutes
offering
ive
yet
had
this
pours
a
semicloudy
amber
orange
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
hops
mixed
with
a
little
citrus
the
taste
is
smooth
malty
and
complex
initially
there
is
this
bready
toast
malt
taste
that
then
turns
into
a
dry
crisp
after
taste
full
of
flavor
and
very
well
made
o
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
think
i
remember
this
more
fondly
than
it
really
is
maybe
its
because
ive
had
more
pints
of
this
than
most
of
the
nonseasonals
from
deschutes
so
im
numbed
to
its
greatness
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
over
the
last
couple
years
i
dont
know
this
beer
still
is
very
solid
its
no
longer
my
favorite
but
its
toward
the
top
of
the
list
though
a
word
of
warning
the
bottle
serving
is
a
tad
too
bitter
and
woody
for
my
taste
though
still
good
the
bottle
just
doesnt
seem
to
finish
quite
as
clean
diminishing
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
during
spring
this
is
my
go
to
beef
unless
theres
something
new
on
another
tap
overall
deschutes
does
it
again
i
went
to
this
beer
many
times
during
the
spring
and
winter
last
year
and
this
year
its
been
no
different
such
a
phenomenal
beer
from
every
aspect
my
favorite
pale
ale
by
far
deschutes
please
make
this
a
yearround
offering
its
too
good
not
be
there
for
4th
of
july
and
halloween
very
solid
american
pale
ale
no
real
shortcomings
at
all
owell
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
decent
dose
of
hops
but
more
on
the
sweet
side
while
i
am
not
impressed
with
the
style
i
try
to
rate
it
according
to
my
experience
and
i
feel
this
is
a
great
sample
of
american
beer
o
this
beer
has
a
full
hop
profile
with
nice
depth
and
it
has
a
pale
hop
quality
so
it
is
very
sessionable
with
out
make
my
tongue
go
hop
numb
this
must
be
a
classic
nw
hops
brew
overall
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
pale
ale
that
classic
hoppy
honey
taste
that
goes
down
smooth
and
smells
like
a
drink
of
champions
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
o
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
nothing
overwhelming
or
unbalanced
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
barely
noticable
highly
reccommend
this
is
quite
possibly
the
most
balanced
pale
ale
ever
no
wonder
it
has
such
top
level
awards
the
taste
and
hops
are
very
similar
to
mirror
pond
but
there
is
the
grapefruity
orange
and
even
mangoish
explosion
added
to
it
with
a
more
amazing
balance
between
the
big
hops
and
toasty
malt
it
is
a
perfectly
complex
beer
a
pinnacle
of
fine
brewing
ingredients
and
skill
a
must
have
o
i
love
their
mirror
pond
and
this
is
just
as
good
if
not
better

while
the

clean
the
hops
come
across
more
juicy
and
slightly
tropical
rather
than
piny
as
the
palate
warms
up
to
the
moderate
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
pleasant
carbonation
allowing
the
vast
complexity
to
meld
overall
amazing
balance
with
a
nice
complex
array
of
flavors
one
of
the
best
apas
out
there
overall
with
just
a
bit
more
hops
this
beer
would
be
quite
balanced
otherwise
very
solid
overall
really
awesome
deschutes
is
making
some
incredible
beer
ive
been
impressed
with
the
wide
range
of
their
beer
any
of
their
products
should
do
the
job
for
you
o
deschutes
is
slowly
becoming
my
go
to
brewery
for
pale
ales
they
really
know
how
to
make
the
ingredients
work
together
and
nothing
is
overwhelming
i
feel
like
this
6
pack
may
go
by
fast
would
have
again
if
you
like
big
bold
and
bitter
ipas
then
this
ones
for
you
let
it
warm
a
bit
for
best
flavor
o
overall
a
wildly
hoppy
pale
ale
with
a
lemony
hop
bite
and
smooth
creamy
body
cant
believe
this
is
a
seasonal
and
will
enjoy
it
while
i
can
deschutes
is
impressing
the
hell
out
of
me
so
far
welcome
to
illinois
best
by

poured
a
slightlyhazy
orange
with
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
seems
like
it
should
stand
up
more
i
just
gets
a
creamy
mild
floral
and
tangerine
hop
character
the
flavor
however
has
big
biting
grapefruit
over
a
subtle
caramel
malt
backbone
theres
also
a
nice
juicy
hop
undertone
that
sets
this
apart
from
your
average
allcitrus
pale
ale
im
a
fan
its
a
touch
thick
for
the
style
but
damn
tasty
and
a
good
break
from
the
oftenboring
apa
have
a
couple
pints
you
wont
regret
it
piney
and
citrus
hop
flavors
mixed
with
syrupy
biscuits
upfront
well
toasted
malt
and
hop
bittereness
that
lingers
but
does
not
overpower
the
baance
is
a
little
more
hops
than
malt
overall
but
that
being
said
id
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
apa
the
malts
and
hops
each
have
there
influence
on
your
tasted
buds
and
palate
pretty
easy
to
drink
this

abv
beer
o
this
is
a
very
good
secessionable
beer

is
a
nice
amber
with
a
good
solid
hop
smell

just
about
right
maybe
a
little
more
carbonation
oooo
baby
this
one
tastes
perfect
totally
pale

slight
hops
greet
me
with
a
full
flavored
ale
which
i
wish

needs
to
be
a
fulltime
offering
for
sure

robust
pale
ale
with
good
hearty
tones
lots
of
hop
action
in
a
pale
ale
fashion
but
not
obliterating
the
palate
this
is
a
nice
drinker
i
bet
itd

nice
on

and
i
bet
if
i
had
a
very
fresh
sample
i
would
enjoy
it
even
more
overall
i
true
pleasure
to
drink
this
one
i
mean
i
could
sit
back
and
put
away
quite
a
few
of
these
not
overly
hoppy
and
not
overly
sweet
or
fruity
either
just
an
absolute
perfect
balance
to
be
able
to
enjoy
any
time
i
know
this
one
was
past
its
prime
according
to
the
best
by
date
but
its
excellent
imo
even
three
months
past
said
date
nicely
balanced
easy
to

d
very
drinkable
nice
hoppy
pale

good
overall
balance
with
a
nice
hop
profile
this
is
a
great
brew
it
is
very
well
balanced
with
some
very
pleasing
flavors
if
you
see
this
beer
and
are
at
all
curious
about
it
try
it
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
deschutes
i
really
like
the
hoppy
character
with
the
good
balance
of
malt
smell
and
look
are
also
nice
serious
yum
going
on
here
plenty
of
tastiness
good
censurability
theyve
got
a
hit
on
their
hands
this
is
nicely
balanced
and
actually
pretty
unique
i
personally
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
mirror
pond
but
that
is
tough
competition
if
i
could
get
this
more
often
i
would
o
nice
pale
ale
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
would
get
it
again
if
i
saw
it
overall
its
wellbalanced
pick
a
dozen
of
these
and
things
wont
be
so
bad
oa
delicious
apa
with
good
flavor
and
balance
could
drink
this
all
day
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
semi
dark
amber
color
slightly
hazy
and
has
some
mild
carbonation
its
topped
off
with
an
off
white
head
very
bubbly
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
is
accompanied
by
some
decent
lacing
the
hops
are
very
present
and
you
can
pick
up
some
mild
roasted
malts
too
hops
grapefruit
zest
and
fresh
grain
aromas
come
through
as
well
and
you
can
pick
up
a
mild
hint
of
figs
its
sweet
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
slightly
bitter
on
the
side
of
your
mouth
and
in
its
aftertaste
some
citrus
fruits
do
come
through
and
its
bitter
overall
it
does
a
medium
to
heavy
mouth
feel
yum
overall
fantastic
apa
probably
my
favorite
thats
available
to
me
i
wish
this
was
year
round
as
its
just
a
fantastic
beer
that
has
tons
and
tons
of
flavor
but
thats
super
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
at
the
same
time
overall
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
beer
that
is
available
to
me
locally
called
smashbomb
the
taste
is
delicious
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
any
time
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
deschutes
o
brilliant
apa
on
my

year
so

this
year

good
creamy
smooth

nice

nothing
to
complain
about
here
well
rounded
delicious
brew
comes
off
as
your
standard
pale
ale
with
a
fruity
hop
kick
but
not
bitter
enough
to
be
an
ipa
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
citra
hopped
pale
ales
are
really
revitalizing
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
very
complex
and
rewarding
and
even
more
rewarding
considering
that
i
got
the
six
pack
for
just
over
7
one
of
my
best
purchases
without
a
doubt
and
if
youre

once

i
will

category
as
founders
in
that
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer

absolutely
drink
this

its
the

o
this
beer
brings
me
back
to
how
i
felt
about
snpa
when
i
first
started
drinking
it
in
the
early
90s
like
i
was
drinking
something
real
special
could
easily
pass
as
an
high
quality
ipa
in
a
blind
tasting
but
ill
go
with
label
and
call
it
the
best
pale
ale
around
o
this
is
currently
one
of
my
goto
beers
its
tasty
highly
drinkable
the
hops
are
nicely
displayed
but
its
not
palatedestroying
and
you
can
have
a
couple
of
them
in
a
night
without
overdoing
things
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
isnt
a
yearround
beer
o
solid
brew
that
deserves
a
spot
in
everyones
fridge
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
beer
that
hits
a
number
of
very
nice
notes
definitely
one
to
stock
regularly
provided
its
available
overall
5
this
jumps
into
my
list
of
top
pale
ales
along
with
alpha
king
daisy
cutter
and
dc
brau
public
although
the
nose
doesnt
stand
out
the
flavors
are
incredible
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
a
very
well
done
beer
which
i
will
seek
out
again
very
good
beer
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
taste
much
more
complex
than
your
average
pale
ale
and
isnt
too
over
the
top
at
6
4
the
more
i
taste
the
more
i
like
i
almost
skipped
it
but
decided
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
yesterday
i
will
have
to
get
another
six
pack
before
the
beer
is
out
of

m
bold
well
rounded
but
too
heavy
d
a
really
easytodrink
simple
nice
and
balanced
apa
pour
yields
a
coppercolored
brew
with
a
nice
twofinger
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
before
falling
and
leaving
a
ring
or
two
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
brings
forward
some
light
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
bready
malt
some
citrus
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
with
the
bitterness
working
well
along
with
the
floral
flavor
bit
of
citrus
rind
there
as
well
mild
malt
in
the
background
really
drinkable
and
refreshing
solid
brew
for
sure
thanks
again
drinkability
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
my
wife
is
not
a
fan
of
overly
malty
or
hoppy
beers
and
she
loves
this
one
a
very
easy
drinking
american
pale
ale
that
doesnt
scrimp
on
flavor
dthis
taste
more
like
a
5
beer
than
a
6
4
if
i
could
get
this
in
ohio
id
buy
a
lot
of
it
as
always
id
always
be
up
for
a
deschutes
brew
and
if
out
west
id
recommend
this
a
very
exceptional
example
of
northwest
pale
ale
deschutes
has
one
of
the
best
track
records
with
me
not
a
bad
beer
yet
pours
a
semiclear
dark
orangebrown
color
with
a
small
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
tiny
cap
smells
strongly
of
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hops
and
some
sweet
malt
somewhat
astringent
hop
taste
up
front
with
the
sweet
malt
coming
in
at
the
end
good
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
very
hop
heavy
i
read
that
this
beer
replaced
the
red
chair
ipa
that
was
a
bond
street
series
from
deschutes
and
honestly
i
have
had
that
beer
and
it
was
much
much
better
than
this
offering
o
i
love
a
good
american
pale
ale
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
drink
a
number
of
in
a
night
worth
getting
sometime
to
try
pours
a
lovely
dark
gold
with
a
huge
head
hoppy
nose
and
hoppy
taste
this
is
the
hoppy
cousin
to
the
mirror
pond
totally
drinkable
but
very
well
balanced
with
the
hops
showing
up
as
the
star
in
this
beer
i
hope
this
shows
up
in
bc
as
it
is
a
great
staple
beer
for
the
fridge
overall
quite
tasty
though
i
like
mirror
pond
better
o
excellent
and
unique
choice
one
to
go
back
to
time
and
time
again
a
real
treat
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
and
marvel
at
the
craftsmanship
and
time
devoted
to
entertaining
our
beer
obsession
opinion
i
am
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
flavor
and
the
hop
schedule
is
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
and
recommend
it
especially
if
you
enjoy
hoppy
beers
appearance
is
a
lightly
clouded
mid
amber
having
a
thin
head
but
fair
lace
smell
has
that
strong
nice
balance
of
rich
malts
and
floral
hops
taste
has
a
light
sweet
to
the
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
citric
hops
that
ends
dry
after
going
down
mouthfeel
is
a
viscous
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
enjoyable
hearty
ale
all
in
all
i
wouldnt
judge
deschutes
over
this
one
im
gonna
hunt
them
down
for
others
but
i
guess
this
is
an
example
of
the
american
love
for
hops
that
i
confess
i
share
that
isnt
quite
what
you
expect
too
generic
too
bitter
but
too
simple
i
like
my
beer
bitter
but
flavourful
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
really
refreshing
and
clean
still
has
alot
of
flavor
but
isnt
cumbersome
all
in
all
an
undeniable
gradea
beer
o
just
a
spectacular
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
imho
seems
to
taste
more
hoppy
one
day
and
more
malty
another
very
complex
but
yet
simple
and
also
very
drinkable
i
have
yet
to
have
a
deschutes
beer
that
disappoints
and
this
one
is
one
of
their
very
best
o
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
expected
this
to
drink
more
like
an
ipa
considering
the
abv
but
it
really
drinks
like
an
apa
but
with
a
nice
twist
highly
drinkable
go
down
easy
in
the
heat
overall
drinkability
overall
good
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
here
it
has
balance
though
so
its
a
decent
session
pale
ale
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
though
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
strong
carbonation
not
a
knock
as
i
could
have
well
done
2
or
3
of
these
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
about
average
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
of
the
style
it
had
a
very
nice
and
bright
hoppiness
to
it
and
just
enough
malt
to
give
it
some
nice
sweet
balancing
flavors
very
nice
beer
overall
definitely
one
i
could
drink
several
of
very
easily
the
beer
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
stuck
around
it
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malt
fresh
peaches
and
citrus
the
taste
consists
of
grassy
hops
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
and
a
spicy
lemony
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
and
coats
the
tongue
until
the
soft
prickly
carbonation
washes
over
leaving
the
mouth
dry
this
beer
has
some
great
flavor
and
its
not
your
typical
pale
ale
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
drinkability
on
this
is
high
i
hope
it
stays
around
for
the
summer
because
i
could
drop
these
back
on
a
hot
day
and
at
6
4
abv
i
wouldnt
worry
about
getting
toasted
at
least
not
right
away
finish
clean
floral
hops
with
a
little
stickiness
on
the
lips
very
drinkable
i
could
see
sittin
down
with
a
6er
or
a
case
on
the
patio
or
in
a
fishing
boat
and
relaxing
the
day
away
d
easy
drinking
apa
i
would
think
this
is
more
appropriate
for
a
springsummer
release
but
tastes
just
the
same
in
the
winter
drink
nice
layered
profile
and
clean
flavors
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
tastes
great
and
i
mean
deschutes
how
could
it
not
a
good
simple
pale
ale
good
good
good
drinkability
is
mighty
fine
with
me
dont
know
what
else
i
can
say
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
a
solid
pale
ale
with
a
delicious
classically
west
coast
hop
character
this
will
join
the
ranks
of
other
solid
deschutes
beer
mmm
drinkability
very
pleasant
and
balanced
brew
with
a
good
amount
of
desired
flavors
for
the
style
the
abv
however
may
be
a
little
high
for
an
extreme
amount
to
be
consumed
in
a
short
session
thanks
dave
d
well
made
but
not
exactly
delicious
there
is
an
astringency
at
times
in

liked
the
old
recipe
better
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not

good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
a
nice
poundable
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
very
long
time
would
certainly
consider
this
a
session
beer
if
i
lived
in
oregon
extremely
rewarding
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
nice

o
this
must
have
gotten
its

after

but
the
hops
are
lacking
this
probably
isnt
exactly
what
they
had
in
mind
but
it
did
have
2015
on
the
label
and
it
was
shiny
clean
and
had
no
dust
ive
had
fresh
pale
ales
that
i
dont
like
as
much
as
this
though
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beautifully
balanced
american
pale
ale
ill
definitely
get
some
more
of
this
looks
great
and
tastes
fine
its
beer
mixed
six
from
uncle
mike
the
alcohol
was
good
and
while
the
carbonation
was
present
it
wasnt
enough
to
detract
from
the
somber
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
maybe
it
was
the
caramel
malts
that
were
a
bit
out
of
lace
here
but
regardless
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
that
would
be
a
nice
deviation
from
the
more
popular
takes
on
this
style
that
are
more
common
a
bit
more
dryhopped
and
full
than
i
would
have
liked
id
have
this
again
to
take
a
break
from
stronger
and
hoppier
versions

alcvol
nice
after

heavier
beers
this
is
flavorful
pretty
average
apa
easy
to

but
nothing
too
remarkable
glad
it
isnt
as
intense
as
some
of
their
other
beers
no
longer
easy
to
find
in
colorado
so
probably
wont
have
this
as
much
as
i
used
to
i
guess
i
dont
think
my
palette
enabled
me
to
enjoy
this
beer
thoroughly
it
was
very
floralhoppy
tasting
which
isnt
my
favorite
copper
colored
citrus
flavored
more
carbonation
that
i
prefer
o
easy
to

nothing

really
like
this
pale
ale
it
has
a
lot
of
up
front
hop
aroma
and
flavor
with
low
bitterness
almost
not
enough
this
is
an
ipa
with
training
wheels
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
to
learn
to
be
a
hop
head
nice
complex
hop
flavor
and
great
balanced
malt
profile
o
this
one
intrigues
me
ive
had
it
before
straight
out
of
the
bottle
and
a
bit
more
citrus
and
malt
sweetness
came
through
maybe
that
one
was
fresher
who
knows
still
a
solid
brew
o
very
good
beer
that
i
would
revisit
especially
on
a
hot
day
050212
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
as
stated
often
stated
im
happier
with
less
hops
so
this
is
not
bad
something
in
there
has
a
slight
perfumy
not
in
a
bad
way
effect
im
not
up
on
the
attributes
of
the
various
exotic
hops
herein
but
all
in
all
i
like
it
as
a
change
of
pace
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
like
i
said
the
grassy
dominance
tends
to
take
it
down
a
notch
for
me
overall
nice
pale
ale
that
i
havent
had
in
a
while
another
solid
brew
from
these
guys
overall
a
3
5
for
doggie
style
classic
pale
ale
from
flying
dog
brewery
it
was
more
tame
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
which
is
fine
by
me
im
slowly
just
now
starting
to
get
into
ipas
and
apas
i
enjoyed
this
since
it
wasnt
too
extreme
the
malt
taste
did
its
job
awesomely
ill
probably
get
this
brew
again
o
overall
a
light
but
complex
beer
that
is
great
for
those
who
are
just
getting
into
craft
beers
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
o
for
10
a
six
pack
this
cant
be
beat
if
drank
from
the
bottle
the
greatness
of
the
beer
is
lost
foolishly
i
did
this
with
56
of
the
beers
the
aromas
and
flavors
need
to
expand
and
develop
a
liveliness
which
can
only
be
accomplished
by
releasing
it
from
its
brownneck
prison
this
beer
is
okay
not
great
but
decent
looks
murky
and
burnt
orange
the
head
is
nice
and
creamy
and
a
thin
layer
of
lacing
remains
throughout
the
beer
smells
like
piney
hops
and
mild
malt
not
an
overpowering
smell
or
taste
the
taste
starts
out
a
little
fruity
but
then
a
piney
hop
bitterness
takes
over
mid
drink
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
balanced
in
a
world
of
hoppy
pale
ales
this
one
doesnt
quite
stand
out
but
overall
a
decent
offering
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
earth
and
caramel
and
little
else
the
favor
is
sweet
with
bready
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
earthy
hop
to
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sweet
mouthfeel
decent
brew
drinkable
maybe
a
lawnmower
beer
nothing
horribly
exciting
and
no
bottle
dating
cheers
o
first
time
ive
had
anything
from
flying
dog
i
dont
know
why
i
always
overlook
them
anyway
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
glad
to
have
tried
and
i
will
seek
out
others
from
this
brewery
cheers
all
very
nice
beer
ostill
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
i
have
tried
to
like
it
but
cant
in
good
faith
say
its
much
more
than
okay
i
dont
find
it
smooth
and
it
feels
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
which
is
fine
but
id
like
to
taste
a
little
more
sweet
malt
in
a
pale
ale
classic
pale
ale
just
as
the
name
says
crisp
slight
hoppy
bitterness
pale
brownish
color
just
as
you
would
expect
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
soft
white
head
that
went
down
relatively
smooth
not
always
a
huge
fan
of
flying
dog
sometimes
the
beers
are
a
bit
commonplace
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
as
it
was
designed
to
be
straightforward
overall
this
is
a
superbly
done
beer
this
should
be
the
beer
to
get
someone
started
in
pale
ales
if
theyve
never
had
one
it
turned
me
into
a
big
fan
of
flying
dog
brewery
overall
this
seems
like
a
competent
option
for
someone
wanting
a
lighter
alternative
to
an
ipadipa
or
someone
acquainting
themselves
with
hoppy
craft
beers
i
try
to
balance
my
reviews
between
style
expectations
and
my
personal
preferences
bottom
line
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
if
you
like
a
light
refreshing
pale
ale
you
should
like
this
served
in
a
pint
glass
had
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
cut
grass
and
citrus
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
a
little
sweet
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
grass
citrus
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
but
not
to
strong
very
light
hope
flavors
over
all
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
very
clean
crisp
flavors
good
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
overall
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
flying
dog
but
this
one
will
be
hard
to
beat
one
of
my
new
favorites
and
i
will
be
looking
for
a
6pack
doggie
style
is
a
nice
session
drinking
beer
not
too
strong
or
heavy
and
a
flavor
that
will
keep
you
satisfied
very
balanced
beer
reminds
me
of
the
brew
free
or
die
from
21st
if
you
want
a
party
craft
beer
this
is
a
good
choice
plus
you
get
to
ask
your
girl
if
she
wants
some
doggie
style
o
this
must
have
been
reformulated
somewhere
along
the
way
because
i
dont
remember
this
being
so
good
it
wont
blow
the
mind
but
it
will
make
a
great
everyday
goto
beer
i
got
to
give
m
and
l
park
a
thumbs
down
for
beer
selection
flying
dog
doggie
style
classic
pale
ale
45
o
excellent
pale
ale
would
definitely
drink
this
again
very
refreshing
drinkable
not
to
mention
the
name
is
of
this
beer
is
awesome
a
good
if
unremarkable
pale
ale
slightly
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
serving
type
ontap
this
stuff
always
tastes
super
fresh
maybe
because
i
live
a
few
miles
from
the
brewery
and
is
a
great
example
of
an
east
coast
pale
ale
very
wellrounded
and
refreshing
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
not
enough
hoppiness
and
flavor
almost
a
funky
flavor
on
the
end
washes
down
light
and
watery
o
a
summer
refresher
with
substance
another
reason
to
like
doing
it
doggie
style
excellent
apa
recommendable
edit
i
drank
a
second
directly
from
the
bottle
and
most
of
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
issues
went
away
i
would
have
ranked
it
about
a
3
5
direct
from
bottle
much
more
enjoyable
poured
orange
amber
with
one
finger
of
foam
that
didnt
last
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
its
clear
and
has
nice
beer
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
grass
leaf
and
herbal
some
grapefruit
some
forest
and
pine
in
back
of
that
smells
dry
malt
is
biscuit
sweet
bread
and
caramel
the
malt
nose
sweetens
as
it
warms
with
some
pale
honey
taste
is
woody
earthy
both
bitter
and
sweet
semi
dry
malt
base
is
sweet
grain
but
doesnt
round
out
hops
are
tangy
with
the
classic
cascade
profile
of
grapefruit
and
pine
body
is
a
little
thin
and
it
drinks
a
little
heavy
with
the
carbonation
its
unbalanced
and
watery
im
looking
for
something
as
i
drink
and
not
finding
it
the
bitterness
lingers
but
not
well
and
the
alcohol
comes
to
the
palate
in
the
finish
this
ones
forgettable
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
12

pours
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
grapefruit
orange
zest
lemon

caramel
biscuit
floral
and

nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with

taste
of

bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
citrus
citrus
zest
caramel
biscuit
floral
and
light
pine
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
with
good
robustness
of
flavor
and
no
cloying
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
no
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
it
contains
an
overall
nice
blend
of
citrus
hop
sweet
flavors
and
malty
flavors
a
rather
tasty
brew
with
a
easy
drinking
feel
and
taste
the
taste
has
a
slight
pine
bitterness
from
the
hops
with
mild
malt
sweetness
in
the
flavor
which
adds
a
slight
caramel
contrast
to
the
light
lemon
zest
flavor
combined
with
the
grapefruit
aspect
the
hops
add
to
the
light
fruity
yeast
element
the
taste
tapers
to
a
more
dry
and
bitter
hop
flavor
in
the
final
sips
but
is
pretty
balanced
in
general
leaving
a
lingering
hop
acidity
on
the
backside
overall
this
is
great
more
of
a
west
coast
pale
in
the
sense
it
focuses
more
on
hops
and
is
a
small
version
of
the
ipa
in
their
repertoire
but
juicy
citrus
and
enjoyable
drinkability
for
me
i
like
the
freshness
and
would
purchase
this
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
great
didnt
notice
a
big
change
in
recipe
but
i
dont
think
the
changes
hurt
it
taste
starts
with
caramel
malt
and
heavy
bread
has
a
little
bit
of
roastiness
throughout
with
a
hint
of
floral
and
citrus
on
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
creaminess
heavy
body
for
an
pa
with
heavy
and
lively
carbonation

hits
a

spot
for
a

in

light
and

just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
complementary
flavors
to
round
it

that
is
backed
up
by
the
taste
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
i
think
particularly
from
the
relatively
lower
abv
ones
o
good
allaround
pale
ale
and
a
nice
session
beer
o
i
have
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
apa
that
is
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
bitter
which
makes
it
perfect
for
session
drinking
o
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
id
had
their
ipa
before
and
didnt
really
care
for
it
but
this
i
like
a
lot
well
balanced
flavors
and
very
drinkable
doggie
style
reminds
me
of
great
lakes
burning
river
a
lot
only
its
a
little
less
toasty
similar
hop
profile
less
pine
and
more
floral
notes
not
quite
as
good
but
almost
equally
satisfying
not
a
a
bad
beer
overall
i
prefer
a
true
ipa
rather
than
an
american
ale
this
beer
just
wasnt
hoppy
enough
for
my
taste
buds
the
other
beers
i
have
had
from
the
flying
dog
brewery
were
more
memorable
raging
bitch
was
better
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
turn
down
but
i
wont
look
for
it
either
o
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
if
you
like
em
a
bit
of
the
biscuity
and
grainy
side
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
mason
jar
deep
clear

color
with
a
healthy
steady

beery
aroma
with
no
predominant
highlight
feels
light
on
the
tongue
not
too
carbonated
tastes
clean
and
mellow
very
balanced
just
bitter
enough
to
give
it
some
character
this
is
a
good
tasting
easydrinking
beer
one
which
would
be
a
good
call
in
almost
any
setting
pours
a
dark
brown
and
darker
than
other
pale
ales
lightly
malty
in
the
nose
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
pleasant
hop
finish
that
i
could
definitely
do
all
day
it
is
only
5
5
so
no
duis
perfectly
balanced
body
and
hop
character
it
also
has
good
carbonation
i
would
love
to
try
on
draft
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
that
will
make
you
bend
over
and
grab
your
ankles
its
a
nice
apa
and
easy
drinking
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
goes
the
hop
profile
seems
a
little
out
of
whack
when
paired
with
the
lighter
toasted
elements
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
solid
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
personal
rate
3
75
overall
a
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
i
dont
drink
much
of
this
style
but
i
am
thoroughly
please
with
what
i
taste
overall
definitely
not
impressed
with
this
one
nothing
particularly
appealing
about
it
and
the
taste
wasnt
very
enjoyable
not
terrible
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
beer
if
offered
but
for
your
money
there
are
much
better
choices
out
there
o
overall
a
good
drinker
and
like
it
very
sound
beer
with
good
qualities
over
shadowing
the
bad
o
overall
not
bad
taste
was
not
great
but
it
gets
a
3
5
because
i
cannot
do
3
25
and
because
it
has
a
different
taste
for
a
pale
ale
that
worked
well
aroma
was
certainly
disappointing
could
have
used
some
dry
hopping
to
give
it
some
aroma
overall
impression
had
a
hard
time
getting
past
the
yeasty
aroma
may
have
been
an
old
sample
but
no
way
to
tell
wont
try
again
overall
a
fun
beer
to
drink
that
really
shows
off
the
hops
overall
really
good
pale
ale
well
layered
not
too
bitter
hop
profile
given
a
semblance
of
balance
by
a
solid
malt
backbone
classic
american
pale
ale
is
right
this
beer
has
plenty
of
character
it
has
a
nice
malty
smell
and
pours
a
beautiful
gold
with
a
white
1
12
head
remarkable
lacing
can
be
observed
on
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
full
but
not
overpowering
taste
is
smooth
giving
way
to
an
assertive
hoppiness
with
a
mocha
aftertaste
i
love
this
one
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
beer
with
some
character
overall
its
a
hoppy
toast
brew
but
its
just
too
wet
and
watery
to
carry
everything
not
that
great
unfortunately
d
it
certainly
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
but
this
beer
offers
up
a
solid
easy
drinking
feel
with
a
tasty
twang
of
hops
in
the
finish
just
a
balanced
everyday
brew
for
the
craft
beer
drinker
a
good
buy
got
it
in
the
mix
pack
and
was
pleased
nice
blend
of
malt
and
fruity
hops
this
is
an
excellent
classic
pale
ale
that
totally
satisfies
big
tan
head
that
sticks
to
some
extent
throughout
the
session
some
brown
swirls
mix
in
typical
malts
and
earthy
hops
present
to
the
nose
and
tongue
medium
bodied
easy
drinking
apas
are
what
they
are
a
gateway
drug
to
the
ipa
which
in
no
way
detracts
from
their
place
in
the
american
beer
pantheon
o
decent
apa
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
decent
beer
although
it
doesnt
precisely
float
my
boat
wellcrafted
though
and
id
take
the
opportunity
to
try
this
on
tap
if
given
one
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
caramel
color
head
head
retention
is
decent
particularly
as
it
is
continuously
fed
by
carbonation
bubbles
migrating
from
the

the
bouquet
is
mown
grass
and
sweet

theres
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
compliments
the
orange
apricot
toffee
and
pilsner
flavors
decent
beer
quite
drinkable
overall
a
light
and
drinkable
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
a
solid
brew
a
nice
pale
ale
with
some
great
fruity
scents
and
tastes
pretty
smooth
as
you
taste
and
it
continues
on
throughout
overall
this
is
much
more
bitter
than
most
apas
ive
tried
its
one
step
under
an
ipa
slightly
cloudy
pale
ale
with

some
light

sweetness
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
taste
is
hop
forward
with
a
tasty
malt
core
that
glues
the
light
orange
and
bigger
grapefruit
hoppiness
together
hops
are
the
star
here
in
case
you
were
wondering
finish
is
dry
and
mildly
bready
with
a
dry
hopped
pucker
feel
is
crisp
and
light
with
a
refreshing
swallow
a
nice
drinkable
ale
that
is
always
welcome
ive
tried
a
few
apas
now
and
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
brewery
is
also
very
close
so
getting
this
stuff
fresh
isnt
an
issue
i
do
tend
to
buy
s
n
pale
ale
a
bit
more
because
of
price
but
i
enjoy
the
doggie
style
just
a
bit
more
i
normally
pour
my
beers
into
a
glass
but
sometimes
i
just
gotta
keep
this
one
in
the
bottle
and
display
that
wonderful
ralph
steadman
artwork
keep
it
gonzo
beer
is

bodied
it
washes
down
quick
and
easy
and
is
refreshing
no
coating
or
stickiness
dry
ending
little
bit
bitter
overall
a
very
well
put
together
pale
ale
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
and
sweet
making
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
overall
im
pretty
disappointed
here
flying
dog
is
usually
solid
but
this
pale
ale
is
just
average
at
best
very
watered
down
and
just
bland
not
as
bitter
as
some
pale
ales
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
found
the
big
hop
flavor
without
the
big
hop
bitterness
to
be
an
interesting
and
welcoming
touch
o
pretty
good
apa
will
be
buying
more
of
these
just
wish
it
had
more
of
a
hop
profile
with
a
fuller
body
o
i
had
a
mouthgasm
this
is
the
best
beer
by
flying
dog
so
far
even
better
than
the
famous
raging
bitch
so
good
i
think
ill
have
to
wash
these
pants
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
looking
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
head
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
and
hoppy
pretty
well
balanced
id
say
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
sweetness
upfront
that
fades
into
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
pretty
good
plenty
of
carbonation
to
it
and
a
drinkable
body
as
well
overall
this
brew
was
nice
i
cant
really
say
too
much
about
it
in
a
bad
way
its
a
good
drinkable
brew
o
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
obvious
american
hops
but
in
great
balance
with
the
hops
usually
the
hops
overpowers
the
malt
but
in
this
beer
the
balance
is
great
overall
a
really
great
beer
easy
to
drink
but
it
maintains
great
flavors
and
sits
pretty
good
a
great
showing
for
the
category
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
i
would
definitely
buy
and
drink
this
again

like

not

it
is
definitely
worth
having
again
and
id
serve
it
to
others
with
no
qualms
though
there
are
better
examples
of
the
apa
style
this
is
a
good
solid
apa
i
tried
it
in
a
bottle
at
a
random
original
joes
restaurant
up
here
in
richmond
bc
kind
of
odd
wed
get
some
random
selection
from
maryland
here
but
im
glad
we
did
its
delicious
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
o
very
good
beer
smells
great
and
i
love
the
hop
flavor
just
a
very
well
put
together
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
underwhelming
with
some
malt
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
also
pretty
average
with
a
basic
malt
and
herbal
hop
combo
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
and
i
am
not
very
impressed
by
this
one
o
nothing
very
special
about
this
beer
but
very
drinkable
pours
a
bit
hazy
with
decent
sized
white
head
smell
is
bland
with
slight
pine
hops
not
much
citrus
and
some
pale
malts
taste
seems
off
not
much
sweet
or
bitter
a
little
funky
and
dusty
wondering
if
this
was
an
old
bottle
kind
of
strange
light
dry
mouthfeel
a
little
watered
down
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
mediocre
at
best
overall
its
a
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
on
any
occasion
and
one
that
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
its
a
nice
and
simple
craft
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
knock
back
and
enjoy
the
palate
is
balanced
and
quite
delicous
extremely
drinkable
smooth
with
just
enough
bitterness
very
flavorful
will
gladly
go
for
this
brew
any
time
a
very
standard
beer
but
amazingly
sessionable
i
will
give
it
good
marks
for
that
smells
like
caramal
malts
and
hearty
bread
plenty
more
hops
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
on
the
piney
earthy
end
of
the
spectrum
amber
malt
middle
and
a
majorly
crisp
finish
this
would
be
an
excellent
pale
ale
for
the
summer
ice
cold
right
from
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
very
liberally
carbonated
and
finishes
clean
lighter
for
an
american
pale
ale
better
than
average
in
conclusion
a
pretty
good
hopy
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
but
kind
of
boring
not
bad
not
great
a
bit
dark
for
a
pale
ale
but
still
a
nice
copper
color
very
strong
aroma
of
hop
a
bit
different
then
i
was
expecting
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
this
one
i
think
i
may
have
a
bad
one
it
looked
as
it
had
been
on
the
shelf
a
while
over
all
just
a
bit
tart
not
really
sure
about
this
ill
have
to
give
it
another
go
a
pleasant
drinker
not
outstanding
but
it
would
make
for
a
good
session
better
for
drinkin
than
thinkin
overall
really
impressed
with
what
flying
dog
has
done
with
this
beer
the
updated
recipe
has
improved
the
flavor
and
aromatics
but
the
beer
is
still
recognizable
as
the
doggie
style
theyve
been
making
for
20
years
light
body
and
ease
on
the
palate
made
this
a
great
beer
for
the
beach
a
goto
pale
ale
overall
decent
brew
slightly
unbalanced
but
not
bad
i
prefer
hoppier
brighter
pale
ales
beer
is
thin
grainy
on
the
finish
a
little
dry
mild
hop
character
not
a
great
apa
but
decent
other
than
the
aftertaste
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
wowing
though
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
its
still
a
good
beer
though
im
more
of
a
dark
lager
guy
myself
but
id
still
take
this
beer
over
many
others
in
pale
ale
category
flavor
is
light
hops
mostly
pine
but
with
some
notes
of
citrus
in
there
too
overall
this
ones
an
easygoing
easilysessionable
pale
ale
not
flashy
or
really
standout
but
more
than
enjoyable
to
this
palate
moreys
bottom
line
lacks
the
hops
that
i
desire
in
an
american
pale
ale
maybe
if
it
was
fresher
but
without
a
date
who
knows
how
old
this
is
couple
the
lack
of
hops
with
the
metallic
aspect
and
this
sits
at
about
average
at
best
overall
nice
pale
ale
good
malt
flavors
very
drinkable
beer
o
a
decent
apa
that
is
not
overpowering
in
any
respect
but
is
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
it
again
taste
is
a
good
basic
pale
ale
but
not
great
simple
and
a
touch
too
sharply
bitter
in
the
finish
it
is
minerally
grassypeppery
yeasty
and
dryish
up
front
with
faint
caramelised
pepper
citrus
and
grassy
bitterness
light
caramelly
sweetness
it
is
a
bit
vague
and
nondescript
o
its
a
lot
like
sierra
nevada
only
easier
to
drink
and
less
spicy
an
excellent
well
rounded
beer
this
beer
poured
out
with

this

i
cant

much
about
it

way
its
a
good
drinkable
brew
copper
with
little
head
at
all
there
is
a
subtle
fresh
hop
nose
here
but
it
is
not
strong
by
any
means
the
upfront
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
followed
by
a
finish
that
is
pleasantly
bitter
from
both
malt
and
hop
influence
there
is
certainly
nothing
special
here
but
it
is
overwhelmingly
ok
o
a
solid
pale
ale
but
not
very
pale
good
worth
having
my
final
thoughts
overall
this
is
a
balanced
moderately
hopped
session
ale
that
could
easily
be
consumed
6
at
a
time
a
solid
offering
by
my
taste
overall
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
but
this
one
can
definitely
stand
alone
on
its
own
or
pair
nicely
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods

not

beer
for
the
mix
12
pack
i
got
it
in
overall
nothing
special
but
good
enough
its
crisp
and
drinkable
i
guess
you
could
probably
drink
more
than
one
but
like
any
beer
that
is
light
on
flavour
and
character
the
question
always
remains
would
you
want
to
overall
decent
and
real
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
starter
beer
for
a
typical
macro
drinker
or
a
person
just
getting
into
ipas
and
such
its
soild
and
tasty
just
a
little
to
light
and
weak
for
a
seasoned
drinker
not
bad
a
nice
summer
beer
for
sure
thoroughly
enjoyed
visiting
this
brewery
several
years
ago
and
have
consistently
sought
this
particular
beer
out
since
definitely
a
beer
ill
purchase
again
o
hop
characteristics
are
a
little
lacking
but
hey
at
least
its
drinkable
oalthough
it
smelled
and
tasted
great
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
just
a
let
down
although
it
was
one
of
the
more
malty
apas
i
can
recall
o
i
was
a
little
overzealous
giving
out
a
5
for
the
drinkability
third
review
ever
and
its
very
possible
that
i
got
an
old
different
or
defective
bottle
before
because
my
opinion
of
this
beer
has
radically
changed
with
one
purchase
i
still
wouldnt
place
this
as
the
best
pale
in
america
but
its
sure
up
there
o
solid
apa
that
is
pretty
drinkable
and
looks
and
smells
great
i
like
this
one
poured
from
bottle
into
nonic
imperial
pint
clear
amberorange
with
moderate
head
and
nice
lacing
citrus
and
grapefruit
primarily
also
smells
dry
and
spicy
somewhat
mild
but
that
is
typical
of
apas
and
the
smell
lasts
throughout
the
entire
beer
citrus
and
grapefruit
bitterness
countered
by
a
pretty
dry
malt
balance
somewhat
spicy
and
peppery
moderate
carbonation
a
little
thin
but
has
a
nice
firm
feel
very
dry
finish
very
drinkable
apa
i
like
that
it
has
almost
zero
sweetness
which
i
think
makes
it
more
thirst
quenching
and
almost
like
an
english
bitter
with
american
ingredients
drink
this
was
just
okay
for
me
it
was
far
behind
others
in
class
lack
of
balance
and
citrus
or
hops
too
one
sided
to
fully
enjoy
o
not
my
favorite
apa
seems
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
almost
offensively
astringent
at
first
but
a
very
wellbalanced
and
desirable
brew
as
the
brew
warms
and
the
maltiness
comes
through
give
me
2
maybe
3
at
most
but
id
drink
it
again
overall
very
drinkable
beer
safe
in
a
way
with
nothing
memorable
in
either
a
good
or
bad
way
i
wouldnt
order
this
out
o
overall
a
pretty
average
pale
ale
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
but
not
bad
at
all
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
worth
trying
once
o
i
actually
really
enjoyed
the
beer
i
was
a
very
clean
and
crisp
pale
ale
and
while
it
wasnt
complex
it
still
tasted
great
and
true
to
style
nothing
fancy
just
good
beer
othis
is
one
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
anytime
get
a
six
pack
if
youre
bbq
bound
its
good
shit
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
in
the
beginning
followed
by
piney
hops
and
hints
of
orange
fruit
medium
tangy
body
bready
malt
is
balanced
by
earthy
hops
and
citrus
fruit
on
the
palate
long
peppery
dry
finish
not
a
bad
brew
for
flying
dog
o
pretty
good
nothing
amazing
pretty
mild
but
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
decent
pale
ale
with
a
mild
hop
presence
a
sweet
malt
backbone
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
not
terribly
complex
it
is
a
serviceble
but
forgettable
pa
i
have
to
admit
i
work
right
down
the
road
from
flying
dogs
brewery
in
frederick
so
im
totally
biased
here
but
with
good
reason
they
do
have
exceptional
offerings
that
hold
up
to
some
of
the
best
crafted
brews
out
there
overall
this
is
an
excellent
wellbalanced
pale
ale
that
is
in
fact
anything
but
pale
there
is
more
flavor
in
one
bottle
than
in
an
entire
sixpack
of
budweiser
its
easy
to
see
why
doggie
style
has
won
gold
and
silver
medals
at
beer
festivals
o
decent
beer
hoppy
yet
smooth
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
pale
ales
of
similar
style
overall
a
quite
drinkable
beer
a
simple
beer
but
a
good
one
dr
a
decent
price
but
relatively
low
abv
decent
quality
and
moderate
drinkability
its
sort
of
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
pale
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
of
it
o
quite
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
very
little
malt
or
hop
flavor
the
graininess
of
the
malts
combined
with
the
onedimensional
hop
bitterness
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
will
not
have
again
nice
taste
to
it
as
well
starting
with
a
nice
little
hop
bite
and
biscuity
malt
behind
it
the
bitterness
is
small
but
noteworthy
making
this
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
floral
hops
shine
nicely
to
make
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
carbonation
level
is
the
same
both
qualities
of
high
drinkability
flying
dog
is
usually
very
consistent
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
overall
not
a
bad
apa
i
do
appreciate
the
hops
coming
through
as
they
did
i
prefer
my
apas
hoppier
vs
maltier
i
will
probably
have
this
again
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
guy
it
pours
a
clear
bronze
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
mandarin
orange
light
cantaloupe
and
mild
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grapefruit
peel
grass
orange
rind
very
light
caramel
and
a
touch
of
musty
wheat
the
bitterness
near
the
finish
is
a
bit
harsh
and
the
musty
wheat
that
follows
doesnt
help
matters
much
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
wet
feel
overall
an
okay
pale
ale
but
too
strong
on
the
obtrusive
bitterness
for
my
liking
o
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
like
most
pale
ales
definitely
a
good
everyday
drinker
that
i
would
come
back
to
again
do
basically
a
forgettable
contribution
to
the
style
this
pale
ale
apologizes
at
every
opportunity
with
the
hope
that
no
one
will
find
it
unappealingand
cuts
corners
in
the
process
hops
could
be
described
as
ghostlike
here
if
only
there
were
some
actually
haunting
this
beer
the
most
surprising
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
allowed
on
the
menu
at
beachwood
bbq
d
this
has
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
very
nice
pale
ale
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
would
buy
this
again
definitely
worth
a
try
one
of
the
milder
varieties
on
the
apa
spectrum
it
isnt
going
to
kick
you
in
the
throat
with
hops
but
it
still
delivers
crisp
and
balanced
love
the
look
and
the
style
of
this
beer
edgy
and
cool
serious
gonzo
styling
like
all
flying
dog
stuff
on
the
nose
sweet
hops
green
grass
some
apple
peeking
in
flavourwise
theres
a
good
dose
of
toasty
malt
which
fades
to
that
bitterness
that
american
hops
is
famous
for
limes
and
orange
peel
fight
all
over
the
tongue
only
5
5
so
fairly
good
as
a
sesh
beer
too
stamps
of
approval
all
round
this
makes
a
good
everyday
beer
i
was
anxious
to
get
started
so
my
pour
was
pretty
aggressive
resulting
in
just
over
a
finger
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
simply
filled
with
piney
hops
and
i
flashed
back
to
last
night
when
the
young
woman
i
was
meeting
stated
that
she
would
drink
anything
that
was
not
too
hoppy
peoples
awareness
is
astounding
this
also
had
a
nice
amount
of
underlying
malt
sweetness
but
i
was
ready
for
some
hops
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
intermingling
of
piney
hops
and
caramel
sweetness
in
the
mouth
it
makes
me
wonder
why
i
have
not
had
flying
dog
beers
in
a
while
since
i
generally
enjoy
them
finish
was
more
bitter
than
sweet
and
i
felt
much
better
than
i
did
after
my
previous
beer
today
overall
a
nicely
balanced
slightly
sweet
pale
ale
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
i
could
session
this
but
i
could
just
as
easily
pass
on
it
d
well
made
a
good
example
of
a
good
beer
o
i
pray
to
you
only
drink
this
beer
at
a
slightly
chilled
temperature
it
is
a
magnificent
example
of
the
style
d
not
the
best
pale
ale
o
a
good
pale
ale
this
is
definitely
one
to
introduce
people
to
hoppy
styles
without
overpowering
them
very
sessionable
o
good
pale
ale
i
still
think
sierra
nevada
defines
the
style
of
apa
in
fact
this
seem
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
with
an
american
twist
overall
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
nothing
extraordinary
nothing
underordinary
would
very
much
like
trying
this
one
on
tap
o
not
a
beer
i
would
say
no
to
but
not
one
id
pick
up
again
in
a
hurry
its
got
middle
of
the
road
flavor
and
texture
with
nothing
popping
out
at
me
and
it
feels
heavy
so
it
wouldnt
necessarily
make
for
a
good
session
beer
there
are
better
pale
ales
out
there
for
the
same
price
to
be
sure
nice
beerorange
color
cascade
hoppy
grapefruitorangeapricot
goodness
in
the

pleasant

others
have
said
this
is
cascade
hops
pure
and
simple
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
a
nice
zesty
body
happy
to
drink
it
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
poured
into
glass
thin
half
finger
head
amber
in
color
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
all
malts
some
sweetness
taste
follows
the
nose
very
malty
hardly
any
hop
profile
drinks
smooth
not
awful
very
easy
drinking
but
i
want
more
hops
in
my
beer
overall
not
a
bad
outing
i
will
be
putting
one
of
these
off
to
the
side
for
a
buddy
not
sure
if
i
would
spend
more
than
a
few
bucks
for
this
at
a
bar
but
im
glad
that
it
wasnt
super
expensive
o
this
is
simply
put
a
good
beer
however
being
that
its
local
and
having
a
bit
of
a
sentimental
aspect
it
was
the
first
beer
i
bought
regularly
for
parties
and
such
the
overall
for
this
beer
gets
a
bit
of
a
boost
finish
light
floral
hops
linger
on
the
back
of
the
palate
overall
an
adequate
flying
dog
but
go
for
the
imperial
series
if
you
really
want
to
get
blown
away
light
golden
color
little
head
but
a
few
white
bubbles
poke
around
the
glass
aromas
are
simple
and
light
hop
and
grain
flavor
is
very
light
and
easy
clean
malt
and
one
dimensional
hop
finish
very
quaffable
mouthfeel
is
light
and
nicely
balanced
good
session
brew
o
too
bad
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
stuff
steadmans
art
is
great
the
names
kill
me
it
all
just
seems
like
an
inyourface
experience
now
it
just
seems
like
theyre
compensating
fortrying
to
elevate
a
lackluster
beer
oh
well
im
still
keeping
my
eye
out
for
other
interestinglooking
offerings
from
these
guys
never
give
up
hope
o
average
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
spectacular
could
easily
put
these
down
while
relaxing
but
with
so
many
other
options
out
there
i
would
probably
pass
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
but
there
are
many
that
are
much
better
i
had
it
on
draft
at
camden
yards
and
that
scores
some
points
for
me
however
it
is
a
pretty
standard
micro
pale
ale
its
aroma
is
good
but
not
great
its
not
so
cloudy
golden
color
is
like
most
in
its
class
the
taste
is
good
and
dependable
and
solid
but
not
special
it
is
a
little
mild
in
the
hops
arena
and
doenst
score
real
well
for
me
in
mouthfeel
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
yeah
good
bright
amber
color
decent
head
smells
of
wet
malt
with
a
moderate
hop
profile
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
but
not
all
that
exciting
which
i
guess
is
ok
for
a
pale
ale
nice
mouthfeel
smooth
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
a
solid
pale
nothing
to
write
home
about
od
not
too
shabby
of
a
pale
ale
not
overwhelming
and
doesnt
really
pop
at
you
but
its
a
good
easy
drinker
with
a
flavour
profile
worthy
of
keeping
me
interested
for
more
than
one
o
not
bad
but
not
that
far
above
average
either
with
so
many
other
great
ones
out
there
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
try
this
one
again
poorly
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
transluscent
dark
amber
with
a
good
inch
of
slowly
fading
head
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
hops
yeast
blades
of
grass
and
some
flowers
mouthfeel
is
light
taste
is
yeasty
but
too
much
so
slightly
hoppy
somewhat
floral
not
bad
for
a
mix
12
pack
beer
o
found
this
to
be
a
good
example
of
an
apa
and
sessionable
i
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
with
the
limited
selection
of
a
local
liquor
store
that
has
pick
your
own
6er
carbonated
with
a
light
body
it
certainly
has
a
pale
ale
bite
overall
it
is
a
decently
crafted
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
either
it
could
be
refreshing
in
the
right
circumstance
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
pretty
much
ideal
for
me
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
refreshing
ale
no
fuzz
just
good
poured
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
decent
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
some
subtle
hopping
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
some
hoppiness
some
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
peaches
overall
nice
easy
drinking
style
without
so
mucha
s
a
whimper
of
big
flavor
anywhere
gateway
craft
beer
o
highly
drinkable
very
sessionworthy
the
label
doesnt
lead
one
astray
classic
american
pale
ale
but
still
unique
a
solid
pale
ale
with
nothing
standing
out
drinkable
and
straight
forward
d
certainly
drinkable
for
a
standard
apa
o
meh
not
my
favorite
beer
but
i
could
drink
it
from
time
to
time
for
the
style
its
good
from
what
i
can
tell
with
my
limited
experience
i
recommend
this
as
a
good
lawnmowing
beer
all
credit
to
my
friend
the
beer
samurai
coining
the
term
lawnmowing
beer
poured
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
light
beige
head
on
it
smells
like
some
citrus
hops
nice
aroma
taste
was
very
good
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
good
bitter
finish
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
went
down
very
smooth
and
was
easy
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
picking
it
up
again
taste
a
great
hop
fix
i
am
not
the
biggest
fans
of
ipas
but
this
does
the
trick
to
give
me
the
bitterness
i
am
looking
for
solid
pale
ale
fairly
standard
overall
o
the
bitterness
became
a
touch
abrasive
after
awhile
which
detracted
from
my
enjoyment
o
pretty
decent
hoppy
beer
works
well
by
itself
or
as
a
session
drink
o
a
solid
brew
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
good
ipa
a
solid
american
pale
ale
with
a
lasting
hop
finish
d
definite
session
beer
tasty
but
nothing
over
the
top
stays
flavorful
as
it
warms
decent
but
not
up
to
yesterdays
pale
ale
a
new
belgium
mighty
arrow
ive
only
had
one
or
two
american
pale
ales
that
id
really
ever
drink
again
compared
to
germany
and
austria
american
pale
ales
just
seem
watery
and
tasteless
d
great
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
4
a
nice
beer
with
plenty
of
aroma
and
flavour
if
you
like
aromatic
hops
then
this
is
for
you
the
only
downsides
are
that
it
lacks
bite
from
the
hops
and
the
body
is
more
watery
than
it
could
be
also
not
sure
if
its
really
a
pale
ale
the
colour
is
much
more
amber
however
these
are
minor
flaws
pick
one
up
if
you
come
across
it
this
is
the
only
beer
ive
had
from
flying
dog
so
far
but
this
solid
very
solid
example
of
an
apa
probably
a
good
intro
for
those
looking
to
get
into
the
style
this
beer
is
harsh
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
its
definitely
not
the
better
beers
from
the
flying
dog
arsenal
at
best
this
is
a
mediocre
pale
ale
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
even
on
tap
this
one
didnt
deliver
very
well
i
will
be
hard
pressed
to
choose
this
one
again
i
was
at
a
local
restaurant
with
this
one
coors
and
miller
on
draft
so
i
figured
to
support
the
local
brewery
sorry
i
can
promote
this
one
further
though
not
too
shabby
of
a
pale
ale
relatively
low
abv
makes
this
easy
to
pound
a
few
of
aroma
is
quick
again
and
clean
light
hops
are
totally
balanced
against
a
nice
malty
bill
nice
bread
and
grain
notes
hints
of
lemon
and
pine
and
a
clean
refeshing
taste
light
touch
of
corn
like
flavor
in
the
finish
before
a
quick
dash
of
hops
dries
it
out
and
gets
in
the
last
word
this
is
a
wonderful
vibrant
pale
ale
theres
nothing
classic
about
this
its
down
right
gonzo
drink
is
decent
light
overall
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
but
dry
bitterness
ramps
and
almost
gets
astringent
but
not
quite
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
its
nothing
flashy
but
still
a
good
brew
d
for
a
while
i
was
thinking
of
getting
a
case
but
it
just
wasnt
as
good
as
i
remember
but
would
consider
getting
it
again
aside
from
gonzo
and
double
dog
this
really
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
classic
pale
ale
is
clear
light
browndark

color

that
dissipates

mouthfeel
is
a
little
rough
but
still
above
what
i
would
say
is

a
very
drinkable

i
plan
on
having
again
and
again

if
it
were
an

taste

very
bitter
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
accompanied
with
maltiness
fills
the
mouth
up
with
flavor
but
not
enough
sweetness
or
spicyness
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
for
me
goes
down
kind
of
rough
decent
beer
d
this
one
has
an
ok
flavor
profile
but
its
way
to
malty
for
my
liking
i
would
not
get
this
one
again
and
i
dont
think
that
i
would
recommend
this
one
not
bad
but
not
really
worth
the
time
to
me
d
it
was
drinking
good
but
was
very
light
all
around

pale

yep
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
the
bitterness
i
like
it
pours
a
rosy

of
lacing
takes
some
time
for
this
to
recede

this

dont
fly

would
be

i
like
it

high
the

makes
it

the
best
pale
ale
ever
but
it
really
has
its
strengths
its
very
easydrinking
and
probably
a
very
nice
brew
to
keep
on
deck
id
consider
keeping
six
around
when
it
gets
warmer
outside
easy
to
put
away
a
few
too
many
besides
the
alcohol
this
one
would
be
an
all
nighter
time
to
call
a
cab
a
very
unoffensive
beer
which
bodes
well
for
the
novice
craft
beer
drinker
or
one
who
is
not
seeking
a
lot
of
hops
not
bad
but
i
think
theres
better
apas
out
there
refreshing
bubbly
mouth
feel
and
slightly
less
than
medium
but
not
watery
on
the
palate
highly
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
knock
back
2
or
3
just
about
anytime
this
was
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
the
flavor
was
perfectly
balanced
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
d
easy
enough
to
drink
and
the
flavors
are
interesting
enough
to
bring
me
back
for
another
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
balanced
pale
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
definitely
something
that
should
be
tried
i
did
not
expect
the
color
or
taste
of
this
beer
seeing
that
it
was
a
pale
ale
the
taste
was
great
went
down
very
smooth
was
not
that
bitter
but
ended
with
a
bitter
leftover
taste
this
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
than
a
pale
ale
the
foam
was
white
in
color
bubbley
and
lacey
til
the
end
it
had
a
honey
with
pumpkin
orange
and
gold
highlights
it
had
a
fruity
and
hoppy
aroma
with
hints
of
wood
and
carmel
it
had
a
deep
robust
hops
taste
with
a
citrus
undertone
mouthfeel
fullbodied
with
a
light
twist
drinkability
being
one
of
my
favorite
microbrews
i
love
the
fullbodiedness
and
its
great
for
the
summer
overall
this
beer
is
a
2
thumb
up
in
my
book
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
the
smell
was
wonderfully
balanced
and
the
taste
was
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
im
not
a
fan
of
ipas
due
to
their
bitterness
but
this
apa
is
a
perfect
match
for
me
great
beer
flying
dog
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
elegant
appearance
its
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
its
great
name
the
hops
begin
strong
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
tend
to
become
less
apparent
leaving
you
with
a
borderline
mild
brew
for
the
style
drink
just
an
average
ipa
in
my
books
probably
not
something
id
seek
out
again
drinkability
a
good
beer
the
bitterness
was
not
overwhelming
but
slowed
down
drinking
enough
for
the
beer
to
be
savored
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
this
beer
pours
a
copper
slightly
lighter
than
the
usual
pale
ale
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
beer
is
the
hops
on
the
nose
the
smell
is
definitely
floral
and
reminds
me
of
summer
grass
after
the
strong
smell
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
slightly
sweet
maltiness
it
does
finish
dry
thanks
to
the
hops
which
are
relatively
benign
pretty
easy
drinking
session
beer
o
good
drinkability
refreshing
with
a
strong
american
pale
ale
character
d
nice
solid
pale
ale
would
be
very
versatile
to
pair
with
food
and
could
be
an
enjoyable
brew
by
itself
d
i
like
most
of
flying
dogs
other
offerings
but
im
afraid
they
missed
their
mark
with
this
one
the
off
smell
combined
with
the
lack
of
flavor
or
in
this
case
the
flavors
most
important
to
beer
barley
and
hops
leave
much
to
be
desired
im
kind
of
thinking
i
got
a
bad
bottle
at
central
market
it
cant
be
this
bad
right
d
nice
pale
ale
refreshing
i
could
enjoy
this
after
a
hot
summer
day
mowing
the
grass
d
a
nice
pale
ale
from
f
d
one
that
i
would
thoroughly
recommend
you
try
if
you
have
yet
to
do
so
d
very
nice
beer
i
normally
prefer
to
just
go
with
an
ipa
because
regular
pas
taste
like
diluted
ipa
to
me
but
this
beer
is
almost
like
an
ipa
if
you
ask
me
drinkabilty
was
really
good
even
though
if
i
were
going
for
a
true
pale
ale
this
wouldnt
be
my
choice
that
being
said
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
d
the
beer
is
rather
refreshing
and
quite
sessionable
this
beer
looks
impressive
an
amber
tint
for
a
pale
ale
is
interesting
i
like
the
fact
that
they
used
caramel
120
to
achieve
a
nice
color
they
said
they
used
cascade
hops
for
dry
hopping
during
fermentation
which
gives
the
beer
a
mellow
hoppiness
would
have
worked
better
in
aging
i
think
unless
this
is
what
they
were
going
for
i
feel
they
kind
of
held
back
on
the
hoppiness
even
though
this
is
not
an
ipa
it
would
have
been
nice
to
get
that
awesome
dry
hop
nose
still
a
good
pale
ale
appearance
has
a
golden
brown
with
a
one
finger
bubbly
head
that
quickly
fizzles
away
to
no
remnants
smells
mildly
hoppy
but
nothing
to
sharp
or
fancy
the
taste
is
mild
as
well
with
no
real
lingering
hop
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
or
on
the
taste
buds
the
hops
wash
away
quickly
as
you
swallow
with
a
flavor
of
something
sweet
as
it
goes
down
mouthfeel
is
lighly
carbonated
with
nothing
very
exciting
in
the
way
of
flavor
mildly
put
it
is
a
mild
tasting
beer
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
is
getting
into
craft
beer
drinking
mild
hops
d
could
drink
this
one
all
night
very
drinkable
this
doesnt
fill
the
craving
for
the
genre
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
to
write
home
about
no
caramel
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
simply
blunt
harsh
tones
with
a
drab
twangbitterness
i
like
this
pale
ale
and
a
great
way
to
end
my
variety
pack
on
a
good
note
i
would
recommend
this
to
the
non
pale
ale
drinkers
to
give
this
one
a
try
it
might
just
convert
them
overall
very
surprised
by
flying
dog
on
this
beer
ive
hated
all
of
them
but
this
is
finally
something
theyve
gotten
right
d
very
enjoyable
brew
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
goes
good
with
food
or
by
itself
a
nice
goto
brew
well
done
it
pours
a
light
and
with
almost
no
head
a
burnt
copper
in
color
the
smell
isnt
very
strong
its
very
dry
and
has
faint
hops
and
malt
aromas
but
is
heavier
on
the
hops
the
taste
mirrors
the
scents
it
drinks
dry
and
is
mildly
hoppy
with
slight
sweetness
its
an
alright
pale
ale
nothing
special
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
it
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
hand
i
got
it
in
a
mixed
12
but
i
will
defininetly
buy
more
d
it
may
not
be
all
that
complex
or
powerful
on
the
palate
but
this
apa
is
effortlessly
drinkable
and
a
great
beginners
beer
for
anyone
that
wants
to
try
a
hoppier
beer
highly
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
d
incredibly
drinkable
brew
the
hops
really
put
an
edge
on
this
one
pours
a
clear
midrange
amber
with
a
tall
white
head
and
lacing
nose
is
of
pine
and
marmalade
some
lemon
lemon
grass
honey
and
butter
the
hops
are
grassy
and
mild
with
a
slight
soapy
edge
in
the
mouth
its
fresh
hops
and
soft
malts
theres
toffee
sweetness
which
is
balanced
by
a
citric
bitterness
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
a
lively
yet
fine
carbonation
finishes
with
a
sweet
bitterness
and
green
hops
its
refreshing
and
smooth
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
for
hot
summer
day
also
flying
dog
has
some
kick
ass
labels
and
packaging
doh
yeah
this
is
going
on
the
buy
list
got
it
as
part
of
a
mixer
pack
nice
hoppy
pale
for
when
you
arent
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
medium
body
and
effervescence
all
hops
in
the
aftertaste
slightly
watery
as
well
its
ok
i
guess
but
just
ok
d
good
slightly
malty
pale
ale
its
a
pretty
affordable
option
as
well
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
its
not
to
my
tastes
d
not
bitter
enough
to
be
good
in
that
way
and
not
balanced
enough
with
the
sweetness
to
be
good
in
that
way
either
not
horrible
just
average
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
i
think
the
brewer
has
done
a
nice
job
of
making
this
beer
rather
interesting
m
d
crisp
refreshing
light
bodied
but
flavorful
good
abv
content
that
allows
for
multiple
consumption
of
good
flavorful
beer
dnot
a
bad
brew
for
the
style
very
drinkable
sessionable
and
for
the
most
part
enjoyable
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
an
easy
drinker
nonetheless
there
are
numerous
pales
i
would
rather
be
drinking
than
this
that
are
both
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
d
tasty
but
not
overwhelming
interesting
and
mild
enough
to
encourage
repeated
enjoyment
d
at
5
5
a
good
sessionable
pale
ale
overall
a
solid
beer
d
very
good
i
could
easily
have
a
few
more
d
nothing
too
complicated
about
this
brew
but
it
has
wonderful
balance
and
great
fresh
flavor
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
pours
medium
amber
with
a
slight
dull
orange
hue
and
a
head
that
is
much
more
beige
than
i
would
have
expected
the
head
is
nice
and
fluffy
but
leaves
weak
broken
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
and
pleasantly
fruity
i
am
getting
some
light
citrus
hop
aroma
mostly
bitter
grapefruit
but
it
is
fairly
subdued
malt
is
also
evident
in
the
nose
and
smells
very
bready
and
yeasty
flavor
is
a
bit
perplexing
citrusy
cascade
hops
are
the
predominant
character
i
also
notice
that
this
beer
carries
a
pretty
hefty
bitterness
for
style
but
it
is
not
too
overbearing
the
strange
part
is
that
there
is
grainy
astringent
quality
that
is
not
very
pleasant
and
really
detracts
from
the
other
flavors
in
this
beer
malt
is
much
less
of
a
player
than
in
the
aroma
but
what
i
do
taste
is
fairly
bready
and
nondescript
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
smack
dab
in
between
light
and
medium
and
is
fairly
aggressive
on
the
palate
not
much
carbonation
but
a
dry
bitter
finish
that
lingers
long
after
i
swallow
this
beer
finishes
a
bit
too
sticky
to
be
very
drinkable
not
terrible
but
not
terribly
great
either
definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
on
its
own
but
it
doesnt
ruin
this
sampler
pack
bottom
line
its
a
decent
beer
i
would
definitely
get
it
as
part
of
a
variety
pack
but
would
probably
forgo
it
on
its
own
in
favor
of
my
usual
favorites
if
i
were
looking
for
just
a
pale
ale
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
while
it
is
refreshing
it
doesnt
have
the
same
bite
from
the
ingredients
themselves
that
often
makes
a
simple
beer
great
good
pour
head
which
keeps
a
thin
cover
throughout
the
drink
head
lace
clings
well
to
the
glass
and
hangs
in
there
for
quite
a
while
good
dark
amber
color
around
ebc
42
with
a
slight
haziness
mostly
from
the
wonderful
carbonation
bubbles
bottle
ibu
35
i
dont
consider
it
quite
that
bitter
more
around
high
twenties
good
refreshing
hop
flavor
with
a
great
lingering
after
taste
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
a
bold
refreshing
taste
rich
with
flavor
drinks
well
cold
but
i
prefer
the
better
bite
as
it
warms
to
50
degrees
drinks
pretty
well
id
buy
this
one
in
a
sixer
for
sure
pours
a
nice
orangeruby
color
with
a
thin
head
it
has
a
nice
bitter
bite
to
it
but
its
not
overwhelming
some
citrus
fruit
with
a
hint
of
some
darker
fruit
maybe
plum
weird
i
know
i
couldnt
defiantly
drink
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
a
good
looking
pale
ale
goldenamber
color
with
good
clarity
and
some
lacing
smell
is
good
citruscascade
hops
even
though
its
the
hos
that
dominate
you
can
still
detect
some
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
too
the
taste
is
good
you
can
taste
the
malts
first
followed
by
the
aftertaste
of
the
hops
very
good
classic
american
pale
ale
taste
medium
bodied
with
a
bitter
feel
from
the
hops
with
a
slight
buttery
feel
very
drinkable
though
not
really
a
whole
lot
to
mention
about
this
beer
classic
american
pale
ale
taste
good
for
summer
time
well
malted
and
good
hope
taste
well
balanced
good
pale
ale
and
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
getting
into
craft
beer
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
before
i
corrected
the
bartender
asking
her
for
a
glass
the
beer
was
a
dark
redorange
color
with
a
wellretained
fingerdepth
head
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
bready
like
the
taste
this
one
was
more
bitter
than
i
like
my
pale
ales
but
to
each
his
own
it
had
a
strong
carbonation
and
was
not
the
beer
i
settled
on
md
very
drinkable
and
smooth
brew
enjoyable
pale
ale
i
find
that
while
i
still
prefer
ipas
pales
are
growing
on
me
with
their
simple
yet
complex
flavors
the
beer
pours
a
deep
burnt
orange
or
red
orange
its
mostly
clear
with
a
decent
crown
that
falls
halfway
between
off
white
and
tan
the
nose
is
of
bready
and
caramel
malts
and
a
very
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
as
i
sip
the
first
thing
i
pick
up
on
is
the
malty
sweetness
alluded
to
in
the
nose
a
brief
crack
of
bitterness
hits
next
before
the
hop
flavor
comes
in
to
finish
things
off
im
just
a
little
let
down
that
theres
not
as
much
citrus
in
the
taste
as
there
is
in
the
nose
carbonation
is
adequate
but
the
body
is
a
little
bit
too
thin
for
my
taste
doggie
style
is
fairly
easy
drinking
but
not
exceptionally
so
for
the
style
a
fairly
well
executed
american
pale
ale
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
fd
actually
one
of
the
better
brews
they
put
out
perhaps
a
good
gateway
for
a
bmc
drinker
as
its
not
very
intimidating
d
a
good
beer
which
seemed
to
be
a
little
better
when
it
was
brewed
in
co
although
i
havent
had
it
in
that
long
so
i
just
might
be
used
to
bigger
beers
this
beer
is
just
average
and
a
little
better
than
that
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
rich
yet
light
with
a
nice
hop
presence
and
balance
i
very
much
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
the
roasted
caramel
notes
are
nice
a
bit
different
for
a
pale
ale
but
it
works
well
d
a
bit
rough
for
an
allnighter
but
2
or
3
is
great
on
a
week
night
before
bed
d
would
be
great
to
have
more
often
if
it
were
not
for
the
price
i
would
recommend
it
for
anyone
looking
for
a
great
standard
for
a
micro
pale
ale
a
solid
pale
definitely
east
coast
in
nature
with
the
balanced
profile
id
certainly
drink
again
but
it
would
be
pretty
far
down
my
list
of
priorities
d
i
drink
this
all
day
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
doggie
style
is
another
sold
beer
from
flying
dog
good
beer
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
and
something
i
wont
be
getting
again
however
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
and
definately
want
to
try
other
offerings
from
flying
dog
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
nice
with
a
pretty
even
feel
this
goes
down
well
with
a
great
drinkability
and
makes
for
a
great
summer
beer
and
one
that
would
pair
well
with
a
good
amount
of
bbq
pours
a
copper
color
with
amber
traces
nice
head
nice
retention
great
nose
on
this
fresh
piney
hops
are
heavy
and
appealing
initial
taste
is
good
with
plenty
of
piney
hop
flavour
and
a
decent
caramel
malt
backbone
for
balance
it
finishes
very
bitter
for
an
apa
however
which
hurt
drinkability
a
bit
decent
ale
overall
but
nothing
extraordinary
d
quite
good
a
pale
i
can
session
without
getting
burned
out
on
hops
madness
i
usually
hate
pale
beers
but
i
love
this
complex
drink
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
finger
of
off
white
head
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
caramel
malt
the
initial
taste
was
nice
and
hoppy
for
the
style
i
got
some
pine
that
gradually
gave
way
to
some
citrus
the
finish
is
clean
i
dont
get
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
watery
this
is
an
easy
drinker
i
notice
that
most
of
the
pale
ales
go
down
rather
quickly
on
my
reviews
this
is
not
better
than
burning
river
but
it
is
a
good
beer
a
very
unbalanced
apa
in
my
opinion
sorty
malty
sorta
hoppy
sorta
not
enough
of
either
one
to
impress
moutfeel
is
very
watery
and
thin
do
not
really
care
for
this
its
not
even
as
good
as
the
artificially
colored
fosters
ale
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
pours
a
nice
hazy
copper
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
with
some
hops
slight
citrus
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
bitter
malty
with
some
hops
thrown
in
citrus
medium
body
drinkable
a
not
too
bad
brew
not
what
i
was
expecting
heres
my
only
hesitation
my
label
says
05
today
its
april
2010
this
beer
appears
to
be
five
years
old
maybe
the
hops
just
snuck
away
over
the
past
five
years
to
be
fair
ill
give
it
another
chance
with
a
fresh
one
poured
into
a
bottle
light
amber
wheat
color
great
head
2
finger
creamy
that
stuck
around
the
whole
time
smell
earthy
and
hoppy
slight
oils
and
citrus
taste
was
some
malt
and
mild
grassy
hops
up
front
going
to
an
oily
citrusy
hop
finish
good
beer
good
session
pale
ale
somehow
watery
though
d
wonderful
all
around
could
contend
for
one
of
my
favorite
apas
excellent
clean
hop
profile
without
dwindling
smoothness
and
drinkability
well
done
from
the
355
ml
bottle
marked
223fx10
sampled
on
april
9
2010
the
pour
is
copper
orange
in
tone
with
a
quarter
inch
of
silky
beige
head
that
lingers
and
never
goes
away
completely
the
cascade
and
other
hops
arouse
the
senses
right
away
as
more
of
a
teaser
than
an
overwhelming
zing
a
little
maltiness
is
noted
as
well
as
something
kind
of
like
orange
zest
a
decent
hoppiness
balances
out
the
bitterness
in
the
taste
a
decent
enough
and
drinkable
pale
ale
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
way
down
on
the
list
reach
for
something
more
complex
and
bold
unless
you
are
looking
for
subtle
d
a
pretty
decent
pale
ale
above
average
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixpack
probably
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
a
glass
or
two
having
on
tap
at
a
bar
this
was
a
bad
pour
the
glass
is
effected
by
cleaning
the
draft
system
is
screwy
or
the
beer
is
old
my
glass
was
presented
with
no
head
or
carbonation
a
flat
beer
i
am
familiar
with
this
beer
so
i
knowit
is
better
that
this
presentation
that
being
said
the
color
is
right
the
flavors
are
spot
on
for
an
american
pale
ale
toasty
malt
up
front
with
a
dominant
hop
finish
that
is
not
too
powerful
just
enough
that
you
know
this
is
a
craft
brew
forgive
spelling
errors
reviewed
from
iphone
desperate
for
the
ba
app
pours
a
hazy
amberish
orange
color
disapointing
head
and
retention
smell
is
of
carmel
malts
and
faint
citrus
and
piney
hops
not
much
going
on
taste
is
mostly
carmel
maltss
hops
charachter
is
mostly
bitter
lacking
any
nice
citrus
or
pine
notes
expected
from
the
style
comes
across
more
as
an
enligh
bitter
than
an
apa
slight
twangy
taste
to
it
undercarbonated
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
disapointing
beer
which
lacks
the
brightness
and
nice
hop
charachter
ive
come
to
expect
out
of
an
apa
drinkability
this
is
very
drinkable
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
still
very
decent
this
was
ok
ive
had
many
a
pale
ale
and
this
one
ranked
pretty
average
for
me
taste
was
actually
a
little
too
strong
with
not
much
else
going
on
not
alot
of
complexity
just
that
strong
hop
flavor
but
tasted
too
sharp
and
bitter
for
my
taste
poured
a
good
color
typical
for
pale
ales
dont
think
i
would
order
this
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
bag
average
at
best
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
foam
head
smell
is
malty
with
a
big
citrus
tip
first
taste
is
almost
dark
fruitlike
with
a
smooth
finish
that
twists
into
sweet
bitterness
and
many
a
pleasant
high
hops
to
cap
it
off
decent
complexity
on
the
taste
lighter
feel
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
a
solid
pale
ale
deasy
drinking
and
light
good
balanced
pale
ale
that
brings
everything
i
want
to
see
definitely
a
very
good
beer
to
relax
over
and
would
be
nice
on
a
warmer
spring
day
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
if
it
was
around
would
drink
it
a
pretty
aggressive
poured
yielded
about
three
fingers
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
over
a
fairly
dark
amberorange
brew
lots
of
grapefruit
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
pretty
large
amount
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
from
the
malts
while
pine
doesnt
make
an
appearance
in
the
smell
department
it
shows
itself
in
the
taste
theres
a
bit
of
orange
before
transitioning
to
a
slightly
bitter
grapefruit
finish
theres
also
a
slightly
grassy
note
here
and
there
along
with
a
sweet
doughy
malt
presence
the
malt
might
be
just
a
tad
strong
for
me
its
pretty
decent
but
i
prefer
flying
dogs
bigger
beers
this
is
my
first
time
trying
anything
from
flying
dog
so
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
this
brew
poured
to
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
amber
appearance
had
a
fair
sized
off
white
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
there
is
a
clear
hop
aroma
here
it
is
pretty
nice
but
to
me
it
does
not
stand
out
hops
have
a
somewhat
citrus
smell
and
there
is
a
pretty
good
malt
aroma
the
malts
seem
to
give
a
caramel
flavor
from
the
crystal
that
is
what
comes
to
mind
at
first
and
then
the
middle
seems
to
be
more
about
a
citrus
hop
flavor
late
flavors
seem
to
have
the
hops
but
the
malts
seem
to
catch
up
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
seems
to
me
that
there
are
better
apas
readily
available
but
if
someone
gave
one
to
me
i
would
not
pass
on
it
poured
to
a
nice
two
fingered
head
that
was
offwhite
in
color
brew
itself
was
a
brownish
gold
in
color
lacing
was
okay
was
actually
very
light
smelling
just
of
some
hops
and
malt
again
kind
of
light
tasted
light
also
had
that
pine
taste
going
on
also
of
bitter
hops
and
malt
again
very
light
felt
thin
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
right
this
really
wouldnt
be
my
pale
ale
of
choice
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
these
as
a
session
beer
overall
this
is
ok
nothing
special
this
beer
starts
sweetly
malt
bitterness
comes
with
carbonation
and
dissipates
the
beer
finishes
bitter
but
very
light
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
i
found
this
to
be
more
refreshing
then
most
east
coast
pales
slightly
less
malt
and
a
little
more
citrus
hoppyness
a
nice
apa
pours
golden
orange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
mainly
hops
with
some
earthy
and
resiny
hops
the
flavor
is
earthy
and
resiny
hops
with
lowmedium
bitterness
the
overall
flavor
is
somewhat
dirty
due
to
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
terrific
apa
i
found
this
to
be
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
this
is
definitely
one
i
will
remember
and
plan
on
making
a
goto
taste
is
more
bready
malts
and
great
hop
flavors
citrus
pine
grapefruit
but
nevery
too
astringent
in
mouthfeel
very
crisp
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
a
solid
pale
ale
light
body
lots
of
crisp
lively
carbonation
along
with
pleasant
hop
bitterness
this
might
be
my
new
goto
pale
ale
dinner
beer
i
love
the
peppery
hop
profile
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
this
one
notes
not
a
brew
to
get
out
of
your
way
for
but
a
nice
one
to
have
around
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
body
with
a
big
frothy
offwhite
head
diminishing
strong
aroma
of
hops
citrus
some
dustiness
some
malty
sweetness
but
not
much
mostly
pine
citrus
citrus
pine
in
the
taste
some
breadiness
biscuit
slightly
sweet
but
very
tempered
by
the
hops
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
tasty
very
good
pale
ale
buy
again
no
this
one
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
half
inch
white
head
smells
of
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
tastes
of
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
yeast
pretty
much
dominates
everything
its
a
good
yeast
flavor
but
its
out
of
balance
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
out
of
balance
for
a
pale
ale
it
even
has
a
leg
up
on
sierra
nevada
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
brownishorange
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
not
much
else
going
on
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
some
malts
are
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
bleh
not
my
kind
of
pale
ale
cant
savor
any
mouthfeel
not
drinkable
when
so
many
other
superior
choices
for
this
style
a
brewery
cant
just
go
around
calling
its
beers
classic
without
ample
justification
that
chaps
my
hide
i
am
definitely
not
a
hophead
but
i
am
willing
to
give
ipas
and
pale
ales
a
chance
aroma
is
purely
of
hops
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
smells
like
heather
flowers
more
so
the
hops
flavor
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
rather
strong
unfortunately
this
was
a
drain
pour
but
it
is
still
decent
and
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
had
overall
a
pretty
basic
american
pale
ale
that
fits
somewhere
between
typical
east
and
westcoast
interpretations
of
the
style
m
d
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
okay
apa
has
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
finish
that
almost
tastes
of
an
amber
ale
b
clear
copper
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
head
and
minimal
lacing
nice
caramel
perfumy
nose
with
a
hint
of
pepper
nicely
balanced
with
a
solid
caramel
base
offset
by
a
subtle
hoppy
bitterness
nice
slightly
chewy
mothfeel
highly
drinkable
quality
pale
ale
overall
this
is
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
brew
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
just
about
anything
overall
better
than
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
flying
dog
their
beers
seem
to
be
mostly
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
quickly
diminishing
frothy
offwhite
head
a
hint
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malts
bread
a
hint
of
metal
and
citrus
hops
flavor
is
caramel
malts
straw
pine
and
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
decent
beer
drinkable
body
seemed
a
bit
light
and
the
feel
was
somewhat
watery
but
slick
with
a
dry
finish
this
one
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
special
d
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
enjoyable
above
average
apa
but
to
say
it
was
unique
would
be
an
overstatement
could
be
a
great
session
beer
a
clear
orangeamber
colour
fills
the
glass
with
a
decent
looking
head
that
leaves
an
acceptable
amount
of
lace
smells
of
hops
and
flowers
which
i
guess
is
redundant
but
not
very
strongly
the
smell
is
not
bad
but
it
is
severely
lacking
which
hurts
it
the
taste
is
completely
mediocre
inoffensive
hoppy
taste
that
isnt
bad
but
does
absolutely
nothing
for
me
medium
body
that
goes
down
well
picks
me
up
a
little
bit
but
overall
this
a
decidedly
average
beer
i
have
no
desire
to
have
another
and
am
sad
to
say
that
after
many
great
beers
by
flying
dog
the
doggie
style
classic
pale
ale
was
a
severe
disappointment
d
tasty
and
refreshing
with
an
easy
abv
you
could
be
at
it
for
an
entire
days
game
d
surprisingly
drinkable
but
again
not
what
i
was
looking
for
or
expecting
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
session
beer
as
its
strong
enough
to
satisfy
but
weak
enough
to
not
be
filling
color
is
a
beautiful
reddish
copper
with
a
respectable
foamy
white
head
the
crisp
mossy
herbal
aroma
almost
reminds
me
of
a
european
pilsner
the
primarily
pine
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
wellbalanced
against
a
mild
honey
malt
sweetness
but
the
flavors
are
are
a
bit
muddled
and
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
isnt
as
pleasant
as
it
should
be
medium
bodied
and
easytodrink
making
this
a
solid
but
unremarkable
pale
ale
it
is
a
satisfying
drink
it
is
not
hopped
to
the
point
where
you
have
to
slowly
sip
it
but
it
is
not
too
light
if
youre
craving
the
taste
of
hops
but
dont
want
to
drink
a
strong
ale
then
i
would
recommend
this
beer
overall
i
think
its
certainly
worth
a
try
not
a
particularly
standout
brew
but
since
ive
been
in
europe
i
havent
had
an
american
pale
ale
in
awhile
so
this
has
been
pretty
refreshing
this
wasnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
isnt
something
id
like
to
try
again
drinkability
is
solid
this
is
definitely
one
that
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
the
only
reason
i
couldnt
really
see
having
this
one
around
all
the
time
is
due
to
the
fact
that
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
tends
to
be
cheaper
more
available
and
just
a
hair
more
enjoyable
in
my
book
however
this
is
a
good
option
for
when
i
want
to
switch
things
up
drink
is
decent
although
i
do
think
most
could
have
more
this
is
not
my
cupo
tea
mildly
hoppy
cleanly
sweet
doggie
style
is
an
ok
pale
ale
but
fairly
bland
the
beer
pours
a
medium
rust
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
its
on
the
dark
side
for
a
pale
ale
but
its
mostly
an
appearance
issue
no
strong
specialty
malt
flavors
come
through
in
the
flavor
the
aroma
is
balanced
with
lightly
citric
hops
a
touch
of
caramel
and
malty
sweetness
flavor
is
similar
its
not
bad
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
for
me
for
whatever
reason
i
consider
this
beer
very
middle
of
the
road
the
feel
is
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
but
fine
this
is
an
above
average
brewery
that
also
has
you
guessing
what
style
of
beer
any
given
brand
is
most
of
their
beers
are
very
good
and
they
just
introduced
a
double
ipa
this
beer
the
doggie
style
has
very
good
color
great
carbonation
good
flavor
and
very
drinkable
always
a
good
beer
that
everyone
will
like
drinkability
a
decent
beer
not
the
biggest
fan
of
apas
but
this
is
very
drinkable
just
enough
sweetness
in
the
malts
the
balance
out
the
hops
making
it
an
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
citrus
not
a
lot
going
on
there
the
taste
was
also
citrus
just
a
little
bland
or
maybe
average
describes
it
better
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
beer
destined
to
be
damned
with
faint
praise
just
ordinary
nothing
special
drinkability
a
standard
pale
ale
nothing
exciting
and
easily
substitutable
with
other
pale
ales
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
for
a
regular
ba
this
would
act
well
as
a
session
beer
or
a
party
beer
but
nothing
that
will
get
someone
too
excited
another
beer
from
flying
dog
that
would
be
good
for
beer
noobs
id
drink
it
again
but
this
is
not
outstanding
d
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
as
sessionable
an
apa
as
youill
find
this
was
a
solid
allround
pale
ale
had
a
good
hoppy
nose
while
the
flavor
was
a
solid
hopmalt
combo
and
didnt
have
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
a
solid
body
this
was
a
delicious
pale
and
was
very
drinkable
had
mine
with
tacos
and
it
was
a
great
combo
i
want
to
blame
the
bar
but
theyre
normally
good
with
their
taps
ill
give
it
a
second
chance
when
possible
but
for
now
this
stands
pours
a
nice
midcopper
color
with
some
very
nice
head
and
decent
lacing
has
a
great
citrus
hop
scent
fills
the
nose
but
still
with
a
bit
of
malty
thickness
to
it
great
taste
a
wonderfully
bitter
beer
without
being
too
much
as
bitter
as
possible
while
still
being
a
very
quaffable
near
session
ale
flying
dog
makes
some
wonderful
pale
ales
poured
a
nice
copperorange
with
a
nice
thick
head
but
it
didnt
last
the
aroma
was
primarily
grapefruit
lemon
and
apricot
with
a
subtle
clove
hint
the
taste
yielded
all
aforementioned
citrus
and
spice
flavors
fairly
prominently
which
dissolved
into
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
and
unfortunately
a
somewhat
drybitter
aftertaste
nice
and
mediumbodied
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
but
again
the
dry
aftertaste
was
a
little
annoying
at
least
the
dryness
keeps
you
gulping
and
after
a
few
pints
you
realize
that
its
a
pretty
good
session
beer
i
liked
the
hunter
s
thompson
association
as
well
he
was
an
uneven
writer
but
at
his
best
as
in
hells
angels
hes
one
of
the
greats
drinkability
very
drinkable
apa
i
like
that
it
has
almost
zero
sweetness
which
i
think
makes
it
more
thirst
quenching
and
almost
like
an
english
bitter
with
american
ingredients
great
everyday
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
apas
smells
basic
a
lightly
blended
mix
of
hops
and
fruits
a
bit
of
grapefuit
and
orange
flavor
was
sub
par
did
not
enjoy
it
no
where
near
as
much
hops
as
they
made
it
out
to
be
and
it
just
wasnt
that
good
light
body
with
high
amounts
of
carbonation
like
most
flying
dogs
seem
to
be
bro
approved
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
there
was
none
of
the
body
i
have
come
to
associate
with
a
pale
ale
not
a
bad
beer
not
up
my
alley
but
a
very
good
brew
d
this
is
a
great
ale
by
itself
youll
want
more
than
one
and
would
pair
well
with
grilled
food
ive
stayed
away
from
flying
dog
beers
but
this
was
really
enjoyable
ill
try
this
on
again
sometime
good
work
flying
dog
d
really
nice
flavored
apa
with
enough
of
a
hop
kick
to
keep
me
satisfied
transparent
dark
orange
amber
color
good
creamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
hoppy
and
tastes
malty
malty
up
front
then
a
pleasant
punch
of
hops
followed
by
the
bitter
bite
of
hops
but
the
malt
comes
through
in
the
end
one
of
flying
dogs
better
brews
from
what
i
have
tasted
cheers
i
view
this
as
one
of
the
standards
for
pale
ale
flying
dog
has
struck
an
excellent
ballance
between
taste
and
drinkability
along
with
the
old
scratch
lager
and
snake
dog
this
is
in
my
view
one
of
the
top
beers
is
the
12
pack
selection
the
flavor
is
neither
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
which
allows
for
the
nice
smooth
taste
d
a
solid
pale
ale
that
has
everything
it
should
simple
and
straightforward
balanced
an
allaround
solid
beer
to
enjoy
pours
a
clear
organish
color
with
a
white
one
finger
head
head
stays
for
a
little
smell
is
of
hops
and
not
a
lot
of
other
smells
not
the
complexity
of
fruit
taste
is
mild
of
hops
not
overwhelming
with
a
little
malt
to
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
not
a
lot
of
over
the
top
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
d
very
tasty
and
refreshing
qualities
make
it
a
killer
session
beer
thats
not
strong
enough
to
get
offensive
but
not
weak
enough
to
be
mistaken
for
water
clear
orange
amber
with
a
patchy
eggshell
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
a
skim
of
foam
and
leaves
a
little
lace
behind
the
nose
is
minimal
piney
hops
and
toasted
grain
a
pretty
typical
entry
level
apa
mild
cascade
hops
and
just
enough
malt
to
balance
the
flavors
smooth
medium
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
apa
i
suppose
poured
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
creamy
12
inch
head
smells
malty
and
hoppy
lacing
didnt
last
as
this
beer
went
down
quick
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
good
hop
flavor
that
mixes
malt
and
caramel
with
a
grassy
finish
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
had
a
few
ice
cold
and
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
d
totally
drinkable
id
buy
again
very
well
balanced
i
could
definately
session
this
dog
i
would
rate
the
drinkability
as
good
its
not
a
bad
pale
ale
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
session
pale
ale
drinkability
drink
with
a
meal
doesnt
hold
up
as
a
stand
alone
its
an
average
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
an
awesome
foamy
head
laced
down
the
entire
glass
and
really
impressed
me
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
pale
ale
style
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
citrusy
notes
are
the
big
thing
i
picked
up
on
aftertaste
of
malt
is
also
apparent
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
but
as
i
said
before
just
not
my
style
indeed
this
is
the
classic
apa
copper
color
a
fruity
nose
with
a
mild
hop
scent
a
taste
of
hop
flowers
mixed
fruits
a
pinch
a
caramel
a
good
allaround
balance
and
a
clean
finish
all
this
makes
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
another
one
drinkability
this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
apa
that
i
could
consume
all
evening
while
it
is
not
better
than
some
of
the
others
ive
had
it
would
be
a
fine
choice
if
it
is
the
only
apa
on
offer
d
enjoyable
but
im
not
rushing
for
another
one
overall
a
decent
but
uninspiring
pale
ale
mouth
carbonation
is
high
as
expected
from
the
burst
this
brew
is
crisp
and
refreshing
a
little
sour
but
im
having
trouble
identifying
the
origin
of
the
sourness
bitterness
is
well
present
for
a
pale
ale
witch
is
a
plus
hops
are
citrusy
and
little
piny
aftertaste
is
pleasant
solid
malt
d
not
that
good
this
is
the
first
flying
dog
that
let
me
down
just
not
interesting
boring
beer
overall
better
than
some
flying
dogs
but
not
as
good
as
many
d
this
isnt
my
favorite
pale
ale
i
would
much
rather
go
a
different
route
next
time
when
i
feel
like
enjoying
this
type
of
brew
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
not
disappointed
with
it
since
i
am
enjoying
it
overall
its
my
least
favorite
flying
dog
so
far
doggie
style
classic
pale
ale
from
flying
dog
brewery
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
not
a
big
head
on
this
pour
not
much
smell
here
at
all
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
smell
i
can
detect
a
little
malt
and
hops
on
the
tongue
keyword
here
is
little
its
a
pale
ale
by
definition
but
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
in
this
beer
sure
its
drinkable
and
better
than
most
macros
all
in
all
i
would
have
to
say
yawn
the
crispness
and
dryness
makes
this
a
potentially
refreshing
brew
personally
i
look
for
a
lot
more
malt
flavour
to
my
beers
seemed
a
little
out
of
balance
to
me
nice
amber
color
got
a
strong
hop
smell
along
with
pine
and
citrus
i
found
this
to
be
very
crisp
and
refreshing
while
not
overly
complex
the
flavor
is
solid
and
works
well
with
food
nicely
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
while
you
are
grilling
rr
good
pale
i
would
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
summer
brew
this
is
the
third
different
apa
in
a
row
that
ive
tried
after
alpha
king
and
snpa
and
i
feel
like
im
still
trying
to
come
to
grips
with
this
style
the
hops
here
have
a
good
interplay
with
the
cleaner
sweeter
malt
background
however
as
a
direct
comparison
i
think
alpha
king
just
does
everything
better
and
by
a
considerable
margin
flying
dogs
offering
is
pleasant
but
not
necessarily
aweinspiring
this
is
a
simple
yet
great
pale
ale
good
flavor
nice
balance
and
great
drinkability
i
got
a
case
of
this
and
i
probably
wouldnt
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
it
again
it
was
reasonably
priced
at
less
than
30
a
case
but
in
the
past
few
months
i
have
been
getting
other
pale
ales
that
i
enjoyed
more
i
just
felt
like
this
one
left
me
hanging
a
little
bit
this
is
another
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
just
for
the
flavor
i
have
to
hand
it
to
flying
dog
for
creating
a
whole
list
of
exceptional
beers
and
this
one
is
a
good
starter
for
anyone
great
flavor
with
a
light
hoppy
taste
not
too
heavy
and
the
bottle
looks
awesome
overall
this
is
a
lackluster
version
of
the
american
pale
ale
i
can
think
of
four
or
five
better
ones
off
the
top
of
my
head
it
just
isnt
different
enough
from
other
beers
to
warrant
buying
this
again
not
something
that
i
hate
to
see
in
my
fridge
just
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
d
this
to
me
is
just
okay
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
balance
out
of
a
pale
ale
but
then
again
its
doggie
style
so
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
all
and
all
not
bad
it
just
comes
off
like
a
really
weak
ipa
rather
than
and
good
pale
ale
cheers
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
nite
this
american
pale
ale
is
very
true
to
the
style
and
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
taste
is
delicious
and
its
extremely
drinkable
comparing
it
to
an
serra
nevada
i
say
its
less
hoppy
but
more
drinkable
its
brewed
local
to
me
and
ill
guarantee
it
will
become
a
new
favorite
wow
id
love
to
find
something
nice
to
say
about
this
but
i
just
cant
its
watery
and
lacks
any
real
body
flavor
or
aroma
it
has
an
odd
aftertaste
similar
to
the
golden
ale
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
isnt
good
i
noticed
the
same
funk
with
molson
beers
yikes
avoid
at
all
cost
one
of
the
nicest
bottled
pale
ales
ive
had
pours
a
lovely
orangeish
clear
colour
with
a
manageable
frothy
head
that
subsides
within
a
decent
amount
of
time
orange
in
the
nose
medium
carbonation
in
the
mouth
balanced
bitter
taste
with
a
sharper
more
bitter
aftertaste
that
mellows
over
an
agreeably
long
time
this
beer
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
wispy
foam
head
or
what
one
might
call
lacing
after
it
settles
there
are
some
mild
hop
notes
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
what
i
would
crisp
with
prevalent
hops
flavors
the
flavor
seems
to
linger
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
and
then
dries
up
as
it
fades
into
what
becomes
the
aftertaste
a
nice
beer
on
a
warm
day
but
not
one
that
i
am
going
to
call
all
my
friends
and
family
to
alert
them
to
it
if
you
like
a
pure
earthy
citrus
hops
flavor
then
this
uncomplicated
but
pure
brew
is
worth
a
try
a
good
brew
in
my
estimation
first
time
having
a
flyingdog
and
its
pretty
good
pours
to
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
inch
head
with
some
lacing
but
nothing
crazy
hops
up
front
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
malt
coming
in
ill
say
i
can
definitely
drink
this
one
again
its
got
a
good
after
taste
and
is
a
tasty
american
pale
ale
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
good
all
around
worth
a
buy
the
refreshing
light
flavor
and
abv
make
this
one
a
good
quaffer
especially
in
the
warmer
months
to
come
nice
easy
beer
solid
but
nothing
too
special
d
overall
i
liked
the
fair
amount
of
hoppiness
balanced
by
the
malt
and
cirtus
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
d
really
refreshing
one
of
those
beers
you
want
to
have
after
a
hot
day
out
of
the
sun
d
this
is
a
decent
modest
american
pale
ale
while
perhaps
not
my
favorite
its
everything
i
expect
from
the
style
and
a
well
done
beer
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
very
nice
amber
orange
with
a
good
one
inch
off
white
head
the
head
fades
after
a
couple
of
minutes
leaving
behind
nice
lacing
heavy
hops
in
the
nose
with
both
pine
and
floral
notes
a
little
citrus
in
there
too
it
has
a
certain
raw
greenness
to
it
that
i
cant
quite
place
medium
carbonation
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
for
a
pale
ale
malt
flavor
is
a
little
biscuity
hops
have
a
grassy
taste
overall
this
one
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
a
american
pale
ale
this
is
going
to
the
drain
its
borderline
sour
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
brown
colour
with
a
few
fingers
of
puffy
creamy
white
head
that
leave
minor
lacing
it
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
pine
and
citrus
hops
with
a
decent
sweet
malt
body
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
the
body
could
have
some
more
heft
but
it
finishes
with
a
nice
flourish
of
malt
and
tangy
hops
a
decent
american
pale
ale
worthy
of
a
session
not
bad
for
an
apa
very
drinkable
sort
of
bitter
malty
the
beer
is
orange
in
color
taste
is
really
bitter
with
a
malt
finish
mothfeel
was
medium
overall
its
pretty
good
for
a
session
beer
definitely
a
good
one
to
start
the
night
off
with
hard
to
be
to
critical
of
the
apa
style
as
im
not
a
big
fan
of
it
flying
dogs
pale
ale
is
more
like
a
bass
should
be
simple
civilized
and
drinkable
its
the
a
golden
color
and
perfectly
clear
a
very
respectable
beer
that
you
could
offer
to
anybody
even
someone
used
to
lesser
crappy
american
beer
notes
bbcsd0902timl
overall
a
very
nice
apa
i
usually
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
almost
borderline
ipa
i
thought
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
all
in
all
this
isnt
a
double
dog
by
any
means
but
an
excellent
more
logical
offering
for
any
hop
lover
it
features
all
the
elements
to
make
it
a
classic
apa
in
my
book
very
sessionable
and
very
refreshing
a
must
have
d
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
days
ddue
to
its
mellowness
it
is
quite
the
quaffable
pale
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
since
i
have
3
more
to
go
through
itll
be
interesting
to
see
if
it
stays
consistent
and
major
deviance
i
will
return
d
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
great
you
could
easily
have
several
of
these
without
really
suffering
due
to
lack
of
taste
however
its
just
missing
something
which
keeps
it
from
being
a
great
ale
pours
clear
copper
with
a
disappointing
head
and
no
lacing
light
biscuity
aroma
flavor
is
thin
with
a
slight
toasty
character
and
light
floral
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
rather
disappointing
pours
a
a
bit
darker
than
i
would
expect
for
an
apa
not
much
head
and
almost
no
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
very
little
hop
nose
tastes
similar
but
the
hops
do
come
through
on
the
finish
but
not
strongly
this
is
a
bit
overbalanced
on
the
malt
side
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
good
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
would

session
beer
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
amberreddish
color
with
very
little
head
with
a
fairly
vigorous
pour
smell
is
very
much
like
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
taste
is
very
toasty
and
malty
with
almost
no
sign
of
hops
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
entire
mouth
decent
drinkability
not
outstanding
but
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
you
even
know
it
overall
a
fairly
disappointing
pale
ale
not
necessarily
bad
by
style
definition
but
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
flying
dog
and
think
more
balance
shouldnt
be
too
much
to
ask
for
not
really
bad
but
there
are
many
better
pale
ales
out
there
pours
a
rich
clear
amberorange
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
little
lacing
absolutely
beautiful
smells
strongly
of
hops
and
roasted
barley
nice
and
crisp
with
a
little
citrus
in
it
on
the
first
taste
the
grain
fills
the
mouth
and
is
quickly
followed
by
a
burst
of
citrusy
hops
and
then
a
quick
and
clean
finish
on
the
medium
body
side
for
a
pale
ale
and
allaround
just
a
delicious
treat
very
classic
example
of
the
style
overall
a
really
good
american
style
pale
ale
this
one
is
kinda
par
for
the
course
notes
i
dont
know
i
think
it
might
be
better
with
just
a
little
more
bitterness
just
a
little
but
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
pale
this
is
a
good
brew
that
would
be
nice
to
keep
around
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
pale
ale
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
but
still
very
very
good
an
easy
drinker
this
is
one
i
could
see
myself
having
2
or
3
of
in
a
sitting
this
is
actually
probably
the
only
standard
offering
from
flying
dog
that
i
might
want
to
have
more
of
taste
has
a
bit
of
hop
and
maybe
a
slight
citrus
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
the
doggie
style
classic
pale
ale
presented
a
dark
golden
appearance
the
aroma
was
fruity
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
and
the
taste
was
very
tangy
to
me
it
was
however
light
and
smooth
this
seems
like
a
very
good
summer
beer
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
someone
who
prefers
a
bass
ale
and
is
looking
to
broaden
their
horizons
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
an
all
around
good
entry
level
beer
from
a
pretty
reliable
brewery
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
enough
a
good
session
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
in
my
mind
but
still
flavorful
okay
but
nothing
terribly
exciting
drinkability
similar
to
the
last
brew
i
tried
the
brooklyn
pennant
this
ones
a
straightforward
inoffensive
nottooterribly
flavorful
pale
ale
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
not
terribly
impressive
or
bold
the
alcohols
right
though
and
at
mellow
mushroom
the
price
is
always
right
so
i
dont
regret
buying
it
at
all
light
orange
to
amber
color
with
a
strong
storm
of
bubbles
the
thin
head
rapidly
dissolves
orange
citrus
more
hoppy
than
malty
nose
somewhat
on
the
bready
side
while
crisp
feel
in
the
nostrils
not
that
much
going
on
scentwise
mediumbodied
same
general
profile
as
in
the
nose
more
bitterness
favors
the
presence
of
hops
orange
citrus
touch
of
cocoa
powder
slight
roast
to
it
most
of
the
carbonation
dissolves
before
you
swallow
clean
finish
but
it
would
be
hard
not
to
finish
cleanly
with
the
lack
of
flavor
depth
after
working
my
why
through
their
sample
pack
i
am
interested
in
trying
their
big
beer
line
but
their
normal
offerings
are
rather
disappointing
tasted
this
with
side
by
side
with
several
other
apas
and
this
one
was
in
the
middle
of
the
lineup
preferencewise
i
didnt
find
it
as
hoppy
as
most
other
plae
ales
in
the
same
price
point
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
when
i
first
tried
it
on
the
plus
side
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
overall
characteristics
of
the
beer
lend
themselves
to
it
being
a
safe
choice
when
necessary
this
beer
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
descent
pale
ale
it
has
a
good
head
with
traces
of
lacing
the
smell
and
the
taste
give
you
hops
and
touches
of
pine
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
even
and
drikbability
is
high
a
safe
and
solid
choice
for
a
pale
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
i

i
wouldnt

about
buying
a

for
a
party
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
this
was
my

found
this

in

fridege
left
over
from

party
the
thing
that
stands
out
to
me
is
a
harsh
grassyness
from
the
hops
in
both
the

and
the
flavor
the

player

with
just
a

cover

i
like

can

components
through

the

is

and
it
drinks
smooth
it
will
appeal
to
a

of
drinkers
i
think
the
very
last
thing
on
the
palate
is
that
of
chewing
on

the

bread
crust
flavors
seem
to
shine
through

i
will

ive
always
overlooked
this
one
in

of
everything
else
troegs
makes
i
mean
its
just
a

pale

for
cryin
out

how
many
of
those
exist
on
the
shelves
after
all
but
the
way
it
shows
off
nice
fruitiness
lime
primarily
with
minimal

puts
it
a

above
most
other
examples
of

id
have
no

drink
2
or
3
of
these
in
a

really
solid
offering
that
ive
always
enjoyed
o
a

apa
ill
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
pleasant
beer
that
grows
over
time
balanced
and
refreshing
apa
on
the
average
lower
side
of
intensity
great
fit
for
a
session
beer
overall
this
is
an
interesting
pale
ale
this
is
my
first
review
by
the
way
and
i
have
been
enjoying
this
website
wonderfully
hoppy
pale
ale
that
has
a
medium
bitterness
that
grows
on
you
it
is
rich
but
not
heavy
love
the
smell
the
modest
alcohol
content
allows
me
to
have
several
pints
of
course
it
tastes
best
right
out
of
the
tap
from
troegs
brewery
right
here
in
hershey
i
think
its
their
best
beer
but
i
know
there
is
some
disagreement
on
that
o
a
nice
aboveaverage
pale
ale
bottle
from
trade
thanks
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
small
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
floral
with
some
nice
citrus
and
herbal
notes
flavor
is
a
nice
juicy
light
citrus
with
mild
bitter
and
a
sweet
malt
backbone
goes
down
easy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
nice
simple
exposition
of
the
style
good
stuff
pours
a
really
pretty
straw
color
with
a
touch
of
haze
and
a
modest
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
subtle
mix
of
hops
and
breadiness
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
a
decent
apa
the
taste
follows
through
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nice
a
solid
everyday
kind
of
beer
that
would
be
enjoyed
by
almost
anyone
overall
theres
very
little
to
critique
in
the
way
of
making
improvements
a
bit
higher
alcohol
content
might
be
nice
its
just
a
touch
thin
but
really
this
is
an
apa
splashed
with
quintessence
all
the
core
scents
and
flavors
are
present
with
a
hint
of
charm
from
others
in
fine
balance
whenever
the
scratch
options
arent
exciting
i
count
on
this
standard
for
a
satisfying
experience
in
the
troegs
tasting
room
with
or
without
food
o
this
is
a
really
solid
apa
in
my
opinion
its
light
and
refreshing
but
has
nice
juicy
flavors
in
here
combined
with
that
fresh
biscuit
and
finished
with
the
light
bitterness
that
makes
this
a
great
warm
weather
drinker
only
thing
against
it
would
be
feels
a
little
watery
but
it
doesnt
really
effect
in
a
negative
way
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
which
although
lighter
in
color
than
most
pale
ales
ultimately
seems
more
traditional
than
the
relatively
hopped
up
american
versions
we
tend
to
encounter
today
not
that
i
dont
like
that
just
what
this
one
isnt
solid
brew
good
pale
ale
with
some
flavor
to
it
hops
accentuate
the
brew
rather
than
dominate
overall
not
bad
definitely
a
bit
more
of
the
pinecitrus
rind
hop
profile
which
i
am
not
crazy
about
if
thats
your
thing
then
this
does
not
disappoint
in
quality
though
o
this
is
a
good
easy
drinker
nice
and
mild
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
keep
coming
back
for
more
well
done
o
while
apas
are
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
drinkable
on
my
most
recent
session
with
it
this
one
is
hoppy
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
bitter
bite
but
its
rounded
off
well
with
some
malty
sweetness
so
its
not
too
palettebusting
an
overall
decent
choice
thats
widely
available
in
my
area
i
might
go
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
solely
for
its
easydrinking
qualities
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
troegs
has
a
great
lineup
in
my
honest
opinion
this
isnt
their
best
offering
but
a
really
nice
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
any
other
time
of
the
year
this
doesnt
do
anything
to
push
the
envelope
or
anything
nor
does
it
claim
to
but
a
good
refreshing
representation
of
a
pale
ale
done
right
pours
clear
and
golden
with
some
friendly
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
a
faint
finger
plus
a
little
more
of
foam
that
fell
pretty
fast
to
some
sticky
lace
nose
is
amiable
bright
with
cascade
hops
juicy
and
fruity
with
some
grass
underneath
malt
is
deliciously
sweet
on
the
nose
with
biscuit
bread
and
honey
taste
is
crisp
light
with
a
mild
astringency
and
a
grainy
aspect
of
the
malt
sweetness
broad
leafy
hops
give
a
touch
of
bitter
and
a
kiss
of
orange
while
the
malt
stays
ample
and
sweet
this
is
an
enlivening
pale
ale
that
keeps
its
bitterness
in
check
leaving
the
palate
open
to
a
variety
of
foods
so
far
troegs
is
a
go
to
brewery
for
good
session
beers
overall
i
find
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
the
body
is
light
enough
as
to
where
you
can
drink
a
few
on
a
hot
day
but
not
session
them
preferably
they
would
imbibed
indoors
in
the
ac
at
first
this
beer
is
not
at
all
that
bitter
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
there
is
an
aftertaste
for
sure
making
this
a
tough
beer
to
recommend
as
a
transition
beer
from
peewater
but
making
it
an
excellent
example
of
an
apa
this
one
is
tough
to
score
i
dont
like
the
slimy
feeling
on
my
tongue
and
will
have
to
take
points
for
that
but
all
in
all
excellent
4
out
of
5
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
low
to
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
smooth
lightly
foamy
mouthfeel
thats
easy
on
the
palate
and
flows
relatively
well
closes
fairly
dry
with
lingering
bitterness
enhancing
this
parameter
across
the
palate
residual
stickiness
is
moderate
to
low
o
a
nice
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
quite
simple
but
it
is
a
pale
and
not
an
ipa
o
4
25
definitely
the
most
sessionable
offering
that
ive
had
to
date
from
troegs
very
wellbalanced
with
a
pleasant
blend
of
noble
and
pw
hops
would
go
well
with
or
without
food
n
b
the
innocent
maiden
cousin
of
nugget
nectar
or
perpetual
that
is
worth
seeking
out
if
you
want
something
sessionablelow
alcohol
and
clean
tasting
this
is
a
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
something
you
could
enjoy
everyday
returned
to
this
again
and
loved
it
again
upped
my
review
d
after
recently
having
some
at
the
source
i
found
this
bottle
that
was
also
pretty
young
really
enjoyable
pale
here
nothing
over
the
top
just
good
drinkable
flavors
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pale
ale
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
breadygrainy
ones
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
o
i
only
picked
up
a
single
of
these
to
try
but
id
rather
have
a
12
pack
pours
an
attractive
golden
amber
with
limited
white
head
decent
mouthfeel
hopforward
aroma
has
a
tropical
fruit
focus
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
balanced
flavours
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
tones
with
pineapple
mango
and
other
fruit
tones
the
mild
but
bitter
finish
lingers
for
a
respectable
time
o
a
fine
pale
ale
it
is
very
good
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
although
its
worth
a
try
if
you
like
lighter
andor
grainy
beers
im
new
to
troegs
but
have
heard
great
things
so
far
ive
only
tried
their
pale
ale
perpetual
iipa
and
rye
ipa
but
they
do
an
awesome
job
while
this
is
certainly
a
hopforward
modern
american
ipa
its
a
great
brew
i
wish
i
could
get
my
growler
refilled
in
colorado
o
not
my
favorite
beer
from
troegs
but
certainly
not
bad
as
american
pale
ales
go
its
fairly
generic
it
relies
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
on
its
hop
profile
as
so
many
apas
these
days
do
i
found
the
sweetness
crystal
malt
to
be
a
touch
offputting
too
a
little
bit
more
malt
character
would
go
a
long
way
as
would
a
less
heavyhanded
dose
of
hops
still
a
refreshing
quaff
and
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
pale
ale
a
bit
aggressively
bitter
without
the
hoppiness
oa
solid
pale
ale
with
good
flavor
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
recommend
this
beer
while
we
still
have
the
warm
hot
summer
days
you
wont
regret
pulling
it
from
the
fridge
overall
good
pale
ale
for
craft
beer
enthusiasts
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
pretty
crisp
overall
feel
dry
with
a
slightly
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
and
very
well
made
contemporary
apa
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
pale
ale
although
i
could
live
without
the
strong
perfume
in
the
aroma
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
straw
color
body
with
a
nice
2white
foamy
head
that
stays
a
while
the
smell
is
of
pine
and
hops
it
has
a
nice
hop
taste
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
also
it
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
to
it
also
it
has
a
excellent
mouth
feel
and
is
well
carbonated
and
is
easy
drinking
overal
a
good
apa
overall
i
love
a
hoppy
beer
but
the
other
flavors
just
dont
quite
come
through
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
though
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
just
a
little
onedimensional
not
my
goto
style
but
i
always
enjoy
a
solid
beer
from
troegs
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
which
would
be
great
with
a
meal
but
i
couldnt
do
more
than
2
or
3
as
the
bitter
bite
would
wear
thin
but
the
hops
are
balanced
well
and
it
does
finish
clean
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
nice
classic
pale
ale
a
little
maltier
than
sierra
nevadas
but
still
with
a
nice
cascade
hop
bite
overall
tastes
like
a
classic
american
pale
ale
nice
o
decent
refreshing
pale
ale
good
hop
character
with
enough
of
a
biscuit
undertone
to
offset
thanks
steve
crisp
grainy
and
dry
lighter
in
body
but
it
holds
together
very
well
hop
presence
is
slightly
mellow
and
really
only
coming
through
enough
to
present
the
palette
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
balancing
the
malt
to
finish
super
dry
refreshing
good
clean
and
pretty
standard
id
never
grab
this
over
hop
back
though
which
has
the
same
sessionability
availability
and
price
tag
overall
a
good
beer
especially
for
the
warm
weather
kind
of
like
a
troegs
nugget
nectar
light
a
unique
flavorful
apa
for
sure
very
enjoyable
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
of
this
with
some
pizza
while
taking
in
the
bruins
game
tonight
definitely
in
the
upper
tier
of
pale
ales
oa
nice
pale
ale
but
there
are
easily
better
options
available
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
mellow
grapefruity
hop
in
the
taste
a
grapefruity
hop
and
the
dryness
of
the
rind
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
grapefruit
rind
in
the
aftertaste
a
really
nice
hop
presence
for
a
pale
ale
almost
on
the
verge
of
an
ipa
this
is
a
fine
staple
beer
while
watching
a
ballgame
or
after
physical
work
overall
a
very
standard
brew
through
and
through
nothing
bad
but
nothing
too
exceptional
either
o
a
good
pale
ale
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
not
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
but
still
easy
to
drink
oda
very
solid
apa
i
would
like
to
see
more
beers
available
in
this
style
hoppy
enough
to
maintain
my
interest
but
a
good
choice
when
you
want
something
a
bit
more
mild
than
an
ipa
a
solid
beer
at
under
10
a
sic
pack
i
am
pretty
happy
with
how
this
one
worked
out
brownish
orange
beer
with
a
soapy
head
and
light
carbonation
has
aromas
of
floral
and
citrus
with
some
hints
of
yeast
and
caramel
tart
floral
and
juicy
orange
flavors
with
a
tea
aftertaste
enjoyable
flavors
the
hops
however
bite
a
little
too
hard
for
my
taste
o
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
wouldnt
buy
this
individually
o
compares
favorably
to
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
minus
the
very
bright
citrus
and
pine
worth
having
again
if
and
when
i
go
to
drink
a
apa
again
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
it
leaves
a
nice
lace
too
overall
this
is
a
nice
experience
and
might
make
a
good
starter
apa
i
recommend
it
for
that
purpose
and
for
nice
session
drinking
d
drinks
very
easily
mogoes
down
easy
these
guys
are
becoming
a
favorite
i
will
go
with
this
one
again
overall
a
damn
good
session
pale
ale
nothing
unique
necessarily
just
a
well
made
easy
drinker
here
pours
standard
pale
ale
color
with
a
2
inch
head
smells
and
tastes
well
balanced
with
a
mix
of
hop
varieties
quick
crisp
finish
and
bright
carbonation
make
the
mouthfeel
just
right
this
is
an
all
season
all
situations
beer
that
is
as
versatile
as
it
is
drinkable
not
my
favorite
troegs
brew
but
a
solid
day
to
day
beverage
will
undoubtedly
buy
this
again
this
one
poured
a
bright
clear
yellow
with
minimal
head
and
some
lacing
aromas
were
mild
mostly
hops
and
some
pine
but
nothing
overpowering
flavor
was
a
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
light
in
body
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
a
very
simple
but
great
session
beer
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
pale
ale
the
flavor
profile
is
moderate
but
for
a
pale
ale
its
solid
and
rather
complex
this
is
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
had
when
in
college
and
i
get
more
whenever
i
can
pours
copper
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
like
a
crosssection
of
a
slice
of
white
bread
lacing
indicates
sticky
hops
and
its
right
smell
is
piney
hops
with
a
sweetness
behind
it
sort
of
a
glutinous
smell
taste
is
spicy
piney
hops
up
front
and
biscuity
malts
in
the
back
with
an
almost
cidery
note
in
there
somewhere
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
carbonated
not
a
bad
apa
at
all
but
there
are
better
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
with
a
light
body
and
light
fizzy
carbonation
and
then
a
slightly
bitter
finish
thats
sweet
and
almost
clean
an
excellent
pale
ale
top
notch
and
a
definite
session
beer
a
very
high
recommendation
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
has
a
light
coppery
color
and
a
light
not
very
long
lasting
head
it
has
some
nice
carbonation
and
is
pretty
hoppy
it
has
a
kind
of
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
something
on
the
lighter
side
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
6
pack
of
in
a
sitting
very
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
more
robust
than
most
overall
a
really
solid
pale
ale
another
great
offering
from
troegs
an
excellent
session
beer
ok
its
5
4
abv
so
not
quite
with
plenty
of
character
one
of
my
favorite
apas
quite
the
easy
drinker
could
definitely
have
a
few
this
definitely
ranks
amongst
the
best
pale
ales
you
can
get
it
blends
all
the
flavors
perfectly
and
gives
off
one
of
the
best
hop
flavors
you
can
get
without
it
being
an
ipa
overall
a
good
offering
can
see
drinking
several
of
these
with
a
light
supper
o
this
beer
didnt
smell
like
much
but
the
taste
was
pretty
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
really
smooth
i
liked
this
one
slightly
more
than
the
stoudts
o
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
not
trying
to
be
something
its
not
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
a
good
brew
for
session
or
bbq
drinking
i
will
buy
a
another
case
for
a
staple
to
keep
in
the
fridge
good
but
still
not
my
favorite
american
pale
ale
overall
impression
a
good
pale
ale
not
my
normal
style
so
im
not
the
best
judge
to
provide
comparisions
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
though
this
is
a
good
solid
mix
of
a
pale
ale
that
doesnt
try
to
be
a
borderline
ipa
hop
bomb
lets
the
malt
come
through
and
eventually
dominate
but
gives
enough
presence
to
make
a
statement
easy
drinking
as
well
solid
pale
ale
here
poured
a
1
5
white
head
clear
color
is
golden
verging
on
amber
smell
has
malt
plus
an
interesting
floral
aspect
to
the
hops
taste
is
far
richer
than
either
the
smell
or
my
expectations
prepared
me
for
the
hop
bitterness
carries
through
in
the
aftertaste
and
is
refreshing
theres
also
a
slight
acidic
zing
to
the
beer
which
perks
me
up
quite
a
respectable
pale
ale
d
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
almost
no
head
over
a
clear
copper
body
aroma
is
sourdough
bread
with
a
large
fruity
character
grapefruits
and
tangerines
flavor
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
bready
caramel
sweetness
supports
a
bold
fruity
hop
layer
more
of
the
same
hop
characters
from
the
nose
finish
has
a
light
bitterness
that
sits
on
top
of
the
malty
body
well
the
fruity
hop
character
is
what
makes
this
beer
enjoyed
a
six
pack
while
hanging
out
with
some
friends
i
havent
seen
in
a
while
goes
down
smooth
easy
drinking
o
drinks
very
easy
and
is
what
i
am
looking
for
in
an
apa
a
little
bit
of
hops
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
not
too
filling
done
done
and
done
the
taste
falls
a
little
bit
short
for
me
the
sweetness
appears
again
with
a
juicychewy
mouthfeel
but
there
isnt
much
more
to
it
than
that
the
hops
help
dry
out
the
finish
and
certainly
this
is
easydrinking
but
there
isnt
anything
that
stands
out
this
was
part
of
the
sampler
i
had
over
the
weekend
when
i
visited
the
brewery
for
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
in
the
past
but
didnt
recall
much
about
it
having
it
again
was
really
nice
though
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
orange
color
the
head
was
white
and
fizzy
and
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
nice
sweet
hoppy
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
a
very
good
nicely
balanced
with
hops
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
a
also
very
nice
its
smooth
and
bubbly
very
drinkable
brew
overall
i
found
the
pale
ale
to
be
quite
nice
on
most
levels
i
almost
wanted
to
bring
home
a
growler
of
it
but
chose
the
flying
mouflan
instead
overall
its
a
classic
take
on
the
style
and
a
welcome
sight
in
the
fridge
had
this
at
the
excellent
capital

house
in

bubbly
light
orange
with

that
dissipates
to
a
thin
head
that
stays
throughout
smell
is
a
floral
cascade
of
hops
with
hints
of
malt
and
wheat
taste
is
initially
bitter
but
has
a
smooth
dry
finish
good
session
beer
really
enjoyed
this
its
like
they
took
a
standard
apa
added
the
sweetness
of
some
ambers
and
the
toastiness
of
a
pils
interesting
mix
it
does
say
its
a
copper

very
tasty
stuff

huge
twofinger
head
that
lasts
only
briefly
smells
of
wheat
or
grain
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
taste
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
malty
but
not
by
much
has
some
sweetness
to
it
but
refreshingly
so
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
really
nice
and
the
best
part
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
nice
summer
quaff
from
troegs
pours
a
clear
orangish
copperish
color
with
a
skim
head
with
a
thicker
ring
around
the
outside
the
are
gobs
of
lace
left
up
and
down
the
glass
carbonation
is
visible
the
aroma
is
faint
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
floral
and
citrus
hop
bite
in
the
middle
and
end
good
aroma
but
faint
the
taste
has
a
bigger
sweet
malt
backbone
more
pronounced
then
i
thought
it
would
be
at
the
backend
is
a
floral
and
citrus
hop
bite
the
bite
brings
balance
and
isnt
in
your
face
or
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderatley
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
not
spectacular
but
solid
o
not
bad
but
not
spectacular
worth
a
try
as
are
most
troegs
from
what
ive
had
decent
simple
brew
poured
light
golden
brown
with
about
an
inch
of
welllacing
white
head
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
wellbalanced
with
some
piney
hops
toasty
malts
in
the
taste
along
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
pretty
wellbalanced
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
really
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
overall
very
drinkable
if
youre
just
looking
for
something
simple
id
take
this
over
95
of
whats
being
brewed
out
there
but
i
doubt
ill
ever
seek
it
out
again
a
decent
brew
but
i
was
expecting
more
after
the
aroma
o
a
solid
beer
from
a
pretty
decent
brewery
it
is
a
good
warm
weather
easy
drinking
beer
that
actually
has
flavor
unlike
the
major
adjunct
lagers
i
would
enjoy
one
of
these
anytime
i
had
the
chance
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
good
balance
between
the
flavors
of
malts
and
hops
in
the
taste
the
great
nose
just
hints
at
the
flavor
that
bursts
from
this
delightful
beer
initial
fresh
hop
flowers
followed
by
moderate
to
strong
but
not
overwhelming
bitter
notes
then
a
well
balanced
follow
through
a
lively
well
stored
cask
beer
that
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
pint
overall
an
excellent
world
class
ale
cheers
o
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
its
got
great
flavor
without
pushing
itself
past
being
a
pale
ale
if
you
know
what
i
mean
super
drinkable
and
super
tasty
overall
very
well
done
i
like
th
hop
flavor
and
malt
balance
o
very
impressive
pale
ale
very
drinkable
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
i
would
love
to
put
this
up
against
duclaws
venom
in
a
contest
for
best
pa
in
the
local
area
good
smell
and
the
taste
is
crisp
with
some
pineapple
this
was
a
good
beer
a
fine
looking
pale
haycolored
a
minimal
head
with
a
purchase
of
lace
very
clear
i
can
see
the
buildings
a
block
over
magnified
spectacularly
through
the
glass
aroma
at
this
point
is
mostly
pale
malt
a
little
sweet
some
faded
pine
and
earthy
hop
flavor
is
mostly
the
same
with
a
decently
firm
yet
comforting
bitterness
its
okay
probably
better
fresh
maybe
some
other
time
we
shall
meet
again
and
this
review
will
be
altered
in
the
future
o
a
good
pale
ale
though
a
bit
different
from
what
im
used
to
good
hop
flavor
though
without
being
super
bitter
super
drinkable
perhaps
a
newly
discovered
session
beer
feel
is
nice
good
beer
that
you
could
stay
with
all
day
any
day
well
balanced
excellent
bbq
beer
for
the
upcoming
summer
oa
splendid
choice
worth
having
onhand
year
round
yum
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
top
of
the
line
american
pale
ale
right
up
there
with
dfh
and
sierra
nevada
etc
definitely
a
good
choice
if
found
on
a
restaurantbar
menu
offered
by
a
friend
and
worthy
of
return
purchases
and
visits
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
frothy
head
pleasant
smell
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
very
nice
good
carbonation
that
holds
up
throughout
taste
has
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
but
its
not
overwhelming
some
malt
is
there
and
its
unexpected
but
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
bodied
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
troegs
was
going
for
an
american
pale
ale
and
i
would
say
they
hit
the
mark
d
very
drinkable
super
smooth
and
crisp
and
very
well
balanced
really
nice

balanced

is
as
expected
from
an
apa
though
subdued
somewhat
by
tart
citrusy
flavors
fairly
crisp

not
terribly
complex
but
not
bad
for
guzzling
overall
a

this
is
an
easy
drinking
pale

that
is
perfect
for
the
summer
good
amount
of
hops
for
this
style
of
beer
worth
grabbing
again
do
very
refreshing
pale
ale
i
received
and
drank
this
at
the
wrong
time
of
the
year
downing
a
few
of
these
outdoors
during
summer
would
have
made
my
night
sadly
that
wont
happen
now
overall
very
well
put
together
beer
very
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
i
would
have
expected
this
to
come
from
the
west
coast
recommended
d
can
sit
on
your
backporch
and
drink
plenty
of
these
in
the
summer
time
with
friends
and
family
notes
overall
a
bit
light
on
hops
for
an
apa
but
still
tasty
drink
ability
is
great
tasty
feels
good
this
is
a
special
session
beer
pilsnery
mouthfeel
a
bit
tannic
and
dry
which
makes
the
bitterness
ring
on
the
tongue
a
bit
d
i
dont
know
if
id
ever
crave
this
or
really
pine
for
it
i
could
go
for
another
though
and
its
light
enough
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
in
one
setting
d
an
easy
drinking
good
tasting
pale
ale
low
enough
abv
to
session
with
i
think
in
my
opinion
of
all
the
breweries
in
pa
tröegs
gets
the
most
use
and
flavor
out
of
their
hops
better
than
anyone
this
is
just
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
drinkability
is
way
high
i
could
sit
back
and
consume
quite
a
few
of
these
troegs
is
a
go
to
beer
of
mine
i
havent
been
disappointed
with
a
single
beer
of
theirs
i
really
like
the
diacetly
yeast
flavors
this
seems
too
low
hopped
for
an
american
pale
ale
to
me
i
would
reach
for
their
wheat
over
this
one
im
beginning
to
think
that
troegs
really
has
it
down
pretty
well
this
one
is
no
exception
great
low
abv
beer
that
can
easily
be
seen
as
a
great
summer
drink
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
particularly
the
citrus
flavors
and
aromas
that
truly
mask
the
alcohol
highly
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
decent
especially
for
someone
just
starting
into
craft
beer
just
an
ok
beer
for
me
plus
you
cant
buy
this
in
indiana
so
i
highly
doubt
id
ever
try
this
again
if
someone
offered
me
one
i
guess
id
accept
d
taste
holds
this
ones
drinkability
bit
a
back
no
desire
to
have
another
glass
not
bad
a
pale
ale
but
at
the
price
for
a
6pack
i
could
find
something
a
little
more
affordable
and
tastier
this
came
off
of
the
handpump
with
a
finger
of
thin
ecru
head
that
held
in
amazingly
well
in
the
face
of
the
days
humidity
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
deep
goldenyellow
they
cant
all
fall
bright
i
suppose
nose
was
hopforward
with
a
soft
grassiness
that
again
started
me
to
sweating
the
canquest
tm
has
had
me
drinking
a
lot
of
american
adjunct
lagers
and
i
simply
miss
hops
as
a
result
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
mildly
understated
grassy
hop
taste
on
the
tongue
my
hop
jones
monkey
began
to
cease
his
incessant
chattering
i
began
to
feel
some
maintenance
drinking
upcoming
that
weekend
finish
was
slightly
bitter
very
appropriate
for
the
style
but
leaving
me
still
jonesing
for
more
cue
the
andrea
true
connection
more
more
more
as
stated
in
the
mouthful
this
brew
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
got
a
nice
dry
finish
and
goes
down
very
easily
its
exactly
what
to
expect
with
an
apa
great
representation
of
the
style
i
would
reach
for
this
brew
again
if
given
the
chance
the
palate
opens
with
a
light
bitterness
grapefruitlike
with
some
citrus
and
floral
character
too
again
the
malt
character
is
present
almost
as
a
mild
bread
and
a
little
caramel
sweetness
is
low
and
the
hops
are
very
well
expressed
the
bitterness
slowly
grows
lingering
on
into
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
grapefruit
and
candied
oranges
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
treat
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
cascade
hops
but
this
beer
manages
to
utilize
them
very
well
id
order
more
than
one
of
these
maybe
several
overall
drinkability
is
moderate
at
best
since
i
really
am
into
more
hop
forward
pales
this
one
came
pretty
close
to
my
impression
of
hopback
without
so
much
hops
sweet
drinkable
easy
drinking
would
consider
it
for
friends
d
this
is
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
easy
to
drink
light
refreshing
well
balanced
tasty
not
weak
d
very
drinkable
beer
with
great
flavors
feel
and
medium
abv
d
fairly
high
clean
crisp
taste
is
very
refreshing
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
one
is
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
excellent
example
of
a
pale
ale
d
real
easy
to
drink
very
mild
with
the
hops
but
still
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
d
the
standard
american
pale
ale
a
decent
easydrinking
brew
but
considering
how
many
better
beers
there
are
on
the
market
i
couldnt
justify
purchasing
this
one
again
nothing
too
compelling
about
this
one
i
definitely
could
quaff
a
few
of
these
but
i
cant
say
its
in
my
top
apas
a
very
nice
cool
clean
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
crispy
hoppiness
that
is
sessionable
could
you
ask
more
for
a
pale
ale
thats
available
year
round
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
chewy
superb
drinking
and
a
nicely
balanced
yet
hoppy
variety
of
the
pale
ale
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
shade
of
amber
a
little
hazy
and
a
very
lively
look
to
it
head
is
about
an
inch
and
it
recedes
slowly
leaving
decent
lacing
smells
of
flowers
and
pine
both
very
fragrent
and
mix
nicely
hops
immediately
present
on
taste
almost
as
if
it
were
an
ipa
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
back
as
well
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
actually
a
fusion
between
an
traditional
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
overall
this
is
pretty
good
maybe
not
my
first
choice
in
the
style
however
d
odd
taste
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
bad
a
bit
maltier
than
i
would
like
needs
more
hop
bite
d
i
freakin
love
hops
i
could
easily
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
even
for
those
who
arent
crazy
over
the
hops
it
isnt
over
the
top
so
it
might
be
good
for
them
as
well
drink
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
special
it
actually
reminded
me
more
of
a
pilsner
than
a
pale
ale
but
its
still
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
golden

a
small

a
very
nice
easy
drinking
brew
dm
real
smooth
drinking
brew
slight
carbonation
tingle
not
much
of
a
lingering
taste
but
the
fact
that
it
is
sweet
with
slight
hop
notes
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
quite
desirable
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
of
white
head
not
much
retention
but
nice
lacing
nice
hop
aroma
consisting
of
grapefruit
and
pine
for
the
most
part
i
get
mostly
hops
upfront
in
the
taste
a
crisp
bitter
sweetness
with
a
slight
malt
finish
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
love
this
stuff
during
the
warmer
months
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
right
up
there
with
sn
pale
ale
light
and
smooth
very
drinkable
and
with
a
low
abv
that
makes
drinking
a
bunch
of
it
easier
but
its
just
a
lot
less
interesting
than
troegs
other
offerings
good
head
good
clarity
nice
copper
color
and
plenty
of
lacing
smells
good
and
hoppy
grapefruit
aroma
from
the
hops
are
fairly
prominent
palate
is
pretty
much
classic
apa
pine
and
citric
hop
juice
with
plenty
of
backbone
from
the
caramel
malts
very
flavorful
and
balanced
and
doesnt
ride
the
apaipa
fence
bitterness
is
mild
and
mouthfeel
is
wet
without
being
too
watery
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ale
d
troegs
has
a
drinkable
pale
ale
there
just
isnt
the
flavor
that
you
would
expect
from
this
crew
maybe
nugget
nectar
took
all
the
hops
it
is
certainly
very
drinkable
though
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
of
apa
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
well
balanced
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
drink
well
my
friends
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
color
with
a
several
finger
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
the
nose
brings
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
hops
along
with
a
tiny
bit
of
pine
some
mildly
sweet
malt
comes
through
as
well
taste
brings
good
citrus
and
pine
along
with
some
bitterness
as
well
as
some
mild
bready
sweetness
in
the
background
light
feel
with
good
carbonation
overall
nice
and
subtle
though
not
as
good
as
the
hopback
drinkability
is
fairly
good
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lightly
oily
with
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
for
the
style
and
flavor
of
this
beer
it
has
a
perfect
mouthfeel
overall
solid
beer
with
big
flavor
a
nicely
executed
pale
ale
a
bit
less
hopforward
than
something
like
snpa
and
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
works
nicely
tasty
stuff
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
i
feel
it
should
be
called
very
pale
ale
it
was
bright
yellow
close
to
a
yellowish
pilsner
type
color
good
clarity
on
it
there
is
about
a
half
inch
white
head
that
slowly
fades
and
provides
some
better
than
average
lacing
to
it
the
smell
is
good
when
you
crack
it
open
you
can
tell
its
pretty
hoppy
by
far
the
dominant
feature
in
the
aroma
citrus
floral
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
pine
all
in
all
smells
like
a
good
pale
ale
the
taste
is
good
not
an
aggressive
pale
ale
but
good
in
my
opinion
its
more
of
a
pine
hop
in
the
flavor
than
anything
else
theres
a
sweetness
from
the
malts
that
make
it
pretty
well
balanced
but
mild
overall
still
good
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
a
clean
crisp
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
level
very
drinkable
goes
pretty
quickly
i
like
this
pale
ale
very
reliable
i
cant
say
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
or
drink
it
again
but
id
certainly
get
it
if
available
i
dont
know
why
but
i
really
want
to
try
it
on
tap
nothing
special
for
the
style
but
an
alright
beer
it
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
smallish
white
head
not
too
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
light
fruity
hop
notes
and
some
butterscotch
its
just
kinda
simple
and
light
on
the
hops
mouthfeel

me
i
would
pick
it
up
for

where
some
uninitiated
peers
might
want
to
try
a
craft

without
stepping
too

outside

a

that
takes
a
bit
to
dissipate
very
nice

smells

no

it
has
a

this
is
a
very
clean

crisp

that
gives
you
just
a

of
hops
without

and
makes
a
great

brew
crisp

not

a
solid

provides
for
the
crisp

to
some
real
hop
character
and
balancing

well
done
and
decidedly
drinkable
overall
a
great

biscuity
doughy
even
with

both

the
more
beers
i
have
from
troegs
the
more
i
am
impressed
with
their
brewing
prowess
this
is
a
mighty
fine
pale
and
dare
i
say
this
might
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
here
good
stuff
east
coast
version
of
snpa
good
beer
drinkable
id
be
thrilled
if
someone
was
serving
this
at
a
party
but
a
little
underwhelming
at
a
beer
bar
with
an
extensive
selection
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
buy
again
d
easily
drinkable
the
pale
ale
is
a
great
summertime
beer
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
i
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
medium
bodied
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
goes
down
easily
only
consumed
one
pint
this
time
but
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
is
one
to
be
sipped
all
evening
its
nice
and
mild
spicy
and
bitter
a
decent
example
of
a
plain
pale
ale
d
definitely
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
very
smooth
all
the
way
d
the
drinkability
suffers
for
me
because
of
lack
of
personal
interest
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nowhere
ner
the
upperechelon
of

notes
i
am
really
really
impressed
with
this
my
favorite
apa
i
just
love
it
when
i
do
not
expect
much
and
i
am
rewarded
for
all
of
my
searching
with
such
a
great
tasting
beer
of
course
highly
recommended
d
not
bad
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
not
the
greatest
example
of
a
pale
ale
but
something
that
would
be
enjoyable
to
drink
on
the
patio
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
drinkability
this
is
neither
my
first
nor
my
last
of
this
beer
each
sip
invites
another
so
it
is
easy
to
have
a
second
one
this
also
is
on
my
shopping
list
for
beers
to
drink
periodically
tröegs
pale
ale
is
an
extremely
clear
pale
golden
ale
with
a
dense
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
fresh
cut
wood
flowers
and
citrus
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
a
well
balanced
flavor
it
tastes
resiny
overall
without
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
the
ample
bitterness
carries
into
the
aftertaste
the
malt
flavor
is
pretty
discreet
and
perhaps
a
touch
melanoidal
compared
to
a
sierra
nevada
pale
this
seems
more
english
in
style
but
its
still
solidly
american
it
would
make
a
solid
session
ale
poured
a
golden
body
with
a
good
onefinger
head
that
dies
but
left
lace
behind
aroma
is
plain
but
good
as
it
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
citric
hops
medium
body
chewy
a
solid
malt
base
with
some
sweetness
like
caramel
and
sugar
that
is
balanced
and
tapered
by
a
slightly
dry
hoppiness
with
citric
and
leafy
characteristics
has
a
sharp
backbite
but
does
not
finish
dry
but
more
crisp
with
mild
sweetness
and
just
a
great
ale
to
drink
d
i
could
easily
take
out
a
sixer
of
this
in
one
night
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
night
like
tonight
overall
this
was
just
ok
i
didnt
think
this
was
strong
enough
and
the
crisp
clean
thing
was
fine
but
just
some
odd
flavors
and
weakness
that
didnt
really
stand
up
on
its
own
or
with
food
really
didnt
care
for
this
one
nothing
to
hate
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
far
cry
form
some
other
troegs
products
d
one
of
my
favorite
apas
great
floral
presence
light
and
very
drinkable
great
beer
from
troegs
poured
from
a
slightly
chilled
bottled
into
a
tumbler
glass
the
beer
is
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
modest
white
foam
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
minuscule
bubbles
rising
up
form
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
a
nice
hop
character
to
the
nose
it
smells
fresh
and
pine
like
the
flavor
is
kind
of
average
there
is
some
malt
and
some
hops
to
balance
it
there
is
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
there
is
a
little
bit
of
butter
to
the
flavor
the
butteriness
is
really
apparent
in
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
slick
slippery
beer
i
dont
really
like
the
film
it
leaves
behind
in
fact
id
say
the
buttery
qualities
negatively
affect
the
overall
drinkability
in
the
future
i
would
choose
a
different
pale
ale
over
this
one
d
a
very
nice
apa
it
certainly
ranks
among
some
of
the
better
ive
tried
its
quite
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
which
would
push
it
into
the
ipa
territory
but
the
malt
and
alcohol
just
isnt
strong
enough
to
classify
it
as
such
so
hits
the
mark
and
is
quite
satisfying
to
style
pours
a
nice
medium
dark
copper
amber
with
a
bit
of
white
foam
modestly
sticky
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
a
balanced
hop
ranges
to
bitter
but
never
quite
breaks
a
barrier
and
is
held
is
check
by
the
malt
overall
a
very
nice
blend
good
drinkability
well
made
apa
d
very
nice
representations
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
maybe
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
also
overwhelmingly
of
hops
not
well
balanced
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
but
a
tad
to
hoppy
for
my
liking
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
well
made
beer
it
didnt
have
in
your
face
hops
or
any
extreme
flavors
but
it
had
a
nice
balance
to
it
and
was
an
easy
drinker
very
good
all
around
beer
poured
from
a
fresh
bottle
case
good
until
july
2010
into
a
clean
pint
glass
semiclear
golden
color
and
a
hoppy
grassy
smell
never
described
a
brew
as
green
smelling
before
but
thats
how
i
perceived
it
taste
was
average
pale
ale
kind
of
spritzy
and
hpppy
not
much
malt
mouthfeel
was
good
medium
and
drinkability
was
good
this
would
be
a
good
intro
to
better
beer
for
the
mass
produced
drinking
crowd
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
lots
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
aroma
with
big
grapefruit
notes
and
a
hint
of
grassyness
in
the
back
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
green
hop
bitterness
that
really
swamps
out
the
malt
until
the
end
where
there
is
a
kinda
unusual
astringent
graininess
the
finish
is
lingering
and
the
body
is
to
the
thin
side
of
medium
an
ok
p
a
with
some
balance
issues
d
pretty
drinkable
low
abv
and
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
refreshing
in
the
summer
but
its
not
much
above
some
cheaper
stuff
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellowish
color
good
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
good
lacing
and
spare
carbonation
citrus
hoppy
smell
and
light
sweet
malts
hop
smell
goes
along
with
the
taste
light
floral
hints
and
a
light
thin
body
with
a
faint
bitter
finish
nothing
special
here
but
all
around
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
a
relatively
low
abv
nice
flavor
and
an
allround
simplicity
that
just
makes
it
a
great
drinking
beer
there
are
times
when
you
are
interested
in
a
simple
noncomplicated
beer
that
you
just
want
to
enjoy
with
thinking
and
this
is
that
beer
well
done
wait
a
few
minutes
this
is
best
enjoyed
not
too
cold
as
a
really
wellbalanced
beer
takes
shape
recommended
for
sessioning
d
crisp
and
tasty
i
would
definitely
rate
this
as
highly
drinkable
i
enjoyed
one
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
d
goes
down
nicely
d
i
think
that
i
am
singlehandedly
responsible
for
finishing
off
the
growler
a
sessionable
pale
ale
d
a
solid
pale
ale
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
nice
warm
day
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
true
pale
ale
not
over
hopped
just
clean
and
crisp
id
like
to
try
this
again
when
i
can
find
a
fresher
sample
d
a
pretty
solid
american
pale
it
is
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
it
has
a
clean
quaffable
quality
and
the
ibus
arent
high
enough
to
confuse
you
as
to
wether
it
is
a
hoppy
pale
or
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
full
for
a
pa
and
very
refreshing
refreshing
the
beer
poured
a
nice
old
gold
with
a
good
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
magnificent
burst
of
floral
hops
with
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
was
what
i
expect
and
want
from
an
apa
a
nice
bit
of
malt
with
a
good
floral
hops
wallop
on
top
the
feel
was
medium
and
dry
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
sip
on
or
go
with
a
meal
just
a
nice
all
around
beer
d
being
light
its
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
drink
a
few
due
to
that
reason
alone
but
i
wouldnt
because
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
much
first
taste
was
brilliant
this
is
not
a
very
hoppy
tasting
beer
though
the
taste
is
there
slight
fruity
scent
possibly
banana
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
5
4
goes
down
smooth
dr
very
easy
going
here
overall
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
well
suited
for
sessioning
but
after
being
blown
away
by
tröegs
dead
reckoning
porter
i
found
myself
wishing
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
in
the
flavor
department
and
a
lot
less
carbonation
in
the
body
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
pine
and
pineapple
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
with
some
nice
orange
and
other
citrus
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
this
is
an
overall
good
beer
and
meant
to
be
enjoyed
often
and
during
warm
weather
i
might
have
liked
a
little
more
hops
then
this
one
offers
but
all
in
all
a
very
great
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
all
night
d
great
session
beer
went
down
great
and
i
wish
i
could
have
had
another
hopefully
we
get
more
firkins
up
this
way
from
them
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
not
superexciting
but
very
drinkable
definitely
on
the
better
side
of
all
american
pale
ales
out
there
even
if
its
a
far
cry
from
something
like
three
floyds
alpha
king
harrisburg
d
well
balanced
and
pleasing
to
drink
not
as
bold
as
many
apas
but
solid
and
nicely
subdued
very
drinkable
light
crisp
medium
body
which
is
very
well
balanced
and
more
complex
than
the
average
pale
ale
nice
earthy
dry
hops
up
front
which
are
quickly
countered
by
a
very
refreshing
sweet
biscuity
pilsner
maltlike
backbone
theres
also
a
fairly
prominent
earthy
grassstraw
presence
and
some
sweet
light
crisp
fruit
notes
especially
green
apple
very
quaffable
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beverage
its
quite
mellow
if
anything
too
mellow
kind
of
forgettable
but
perfect
as
a
goto
when
you
just
want
a
bev
medium
to
low
bodied
beer
everything
is
mild
but
well
balanced
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
followed
by
a
nice
level
of
hop
bitterness
the
midpalate
was
met
with
nice
citrus
hop
flavors
drinkability
is
high
and
mouthfeel
is
good
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
pale
ale
drinkable
well
its
downright
gulpable
there
is
still
plenty
of
room
in
this
category
for
a
good
beer
that
keeps
you
cool
during
a
summer
bbq
troegs
pale
ale
fills
that
need
quite
nicely
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
wouldnt
mind
picking
this
up
every
now
and
then
if
it
were
available
in
these
parts
poured
orangeamber
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
decent
carbonation
over
a
finger
of
white
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
citrusy
pink
grapefruit
orange
peel
piney
and
malty
but
the
taste
revealed
a
nearperfect
blend
of
these
individual
flavors
in
fact
the
balance
between
pinecitrus
hop
flavor
and
malt
flavor
might
be
this
beers
strongest
suit
furthermore
it
finishes
on
a
nice
dry
orange
peel
note
perfectly
carbonated
and
mediumbodied
this
is
an
excellent
session
pale
ale
pours
an
orangish
copper
with
a
beige
gead
good
lacing
and
retention
nose
has
grassy
hops
and
pale
bready
malts
taste
has
grainy
malts
and
some
stale
hops
light
body
is
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
light
through
the
finish
not
bad
good
session
ale
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
beer
but
lacking
because
the
malts
are
a
little
weak
and
there
isnt
as
much
depth
in
the
hops
as
i
would
expect
still
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
d
very
drinkable
and
i
even
liked
it
more
out
of
the
cask
because
it
was
warmer
drinkability
a
decent
pale
ale
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
definitely
would
drink
again
if
i
had
the
chance
too
d
very
drinkable
id
have
this
again
for
sure
easily
sessionable
definately
good
troegs
beer
its
always
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
a
subtle
american
pale
ale
that
doesnt
clobber
your
palate
with
hops
good
example
of
the
style
overall
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
i
like
from
my
apas
but
its
still
worth
a
try
as
hop
levels
are
probably
a
personal
preference
troegs
is
by
far
my
favorite
brewery
and
i
love
all
of
their
beer
this
is
a
good
solid
normal
all
year
beer
nothing
too
ground
breaking
and
always
there
if
something
else
isnt
available
definitely
gives
sierra
nevada
a
run
for
its
money
in
my
book
when
it
comes
to
apas
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
chewy
comes
to
mind
but
not
sticky
pretty
drinkable
good
but
not
great
pours
a
solid
gold
with
a
decent
white
head
that
casts
bold
aromas
of
fresh
citrusy
and
floral
hops
and
a
honey
sweetness
flavors
are
well
balanced
a
nice
blend
of
caramelly
malts
backed
by
vibrant
hops
theres
is
nothing
overpowering
about
this
beer
it
works
just
as
well
on
its
own
as
it
does
with
food
pours
a
very
clear
light
orangeyellow
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
a
ring
actually
upon
the
glass
with
every
taste
nose
has
a
pleasant
citrus
hop
aroma
that
is
very
welcoming
to
the
first
sip
also
detecting
a
bit
of
grain
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
mildly
bitter
upfront
and
in
the
crisp
finish
from
the
hops
little
bit
of
malt
taste
faint
sweetness
across
the
body
feel
is
about
medium
to
light
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
ill
have
another
shiny
and
orange
clean
look
on
the
tap
sticky
head
does
a
good
job
and
leaves
some
lacing
as
well
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
leaving
it
pleasantly
bold
while
waiting
for
my
sip
citrics
all
over
this
one
although
the
sweet
pale
malts
take
over
a
bit
much
for
my
preference
toward
the
end
light
body
and
low
alcohol
make
this
a
fairly
sessionable
hop
delivery
vehicle
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
this
beer
was
a
nice
clean
hoppy
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
grape
finish
smell
is
hoppy
color
is
a
clean
gold
with
white
head
the
beer
is
light
mouthfeel
compared
to
most
apas
which
is
a
good
thing
in
some
ways
the
drinkablity
is
aided
by
the
lightness
this
turned
out
to
be
a
middle
of
the
pack
apa
attractive
looking
with
a
clear
golden
color
and
a
two
inch
head
that
had
good
retention
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
cascade
hops
give
a
nice
citrus
aroma
that
compliments
the
sweet
malt
has
a
citrus
flavor
and
a
slightly
sweet
malt
flavor
but
it
lacks
depth
and
substance
finishes
with
a
slight
citrus
flavor
that
does
not
linger
too
long
the
body
is
a
little
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
nice
easy
to
drink
but
overall
it
lacks
the
qualities
that
make
a
good
beer
received
in
a
sampler
12
pack
of
craft
beers
from
freshdirect
hey
its
one
of
the
few
ways
those
of
us
located
in
nyc
can
find
craft
beer
appearance
was
a
light
amber
color
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
just
like
an
apa
should
be
great
drinkability
this
went
down
nice
and
easy
this
ones
a
simple
brew
with
a
good
flavor
strong
enough
to
be
enjoyed
by
seasoned
drinkers
and
gentle
enough
for
the
amateur
a
good
inbetween
beer
drinkability
truthfully
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
for
all
that
it
lacks
it
also
lacks
anything
unpleasant
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
may
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
in
transition
between
nascar
beer
and
good
beer
in
summary
i
would
say
this
is
what
the
folks
in
the
box
seats
should
be
drinking
at
the
races
d
well
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
let
down
from
them
i
was
excited
to
get
it
and
it
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
bitter
and
it
would
have
scored
a
lot
better
than
what
i
gave
it
neither
good
or
bad
more
like
a
fence
sitter
d
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
and
smoothness
a
great
session
beer
for
sure
and
would
love
to
have
this
stocked
in
the
fridge
d
this
is
a
great
goto
beer
for
me
during
the
summer
its
not
a
hop
bomb
but
they
are
there
i
love
how
crisp
this
one
is
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
overall
a
very
standard
pale
ale
that
i
could
see
myself
purchasing
again
especially
at
such
a
great
price
d
great
pale
ale
good
summer
beer
very
refreshing
and
well
balanced
i
would
compare
this
to
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
rate
it
slightly
ahead
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
color
was
an
darker
orange
amber
with
a
very
thin
bubbly
head
small
amounts
of
carbonation
kept
rising
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
hoppy
and
slightly
sweet
taste
was
a
bit
bitter
with
undertones
of
burnt
grains
felt
very
good
in
the
mouth
coated
well
lasted
just
long
enough
to
be
pleasant
went
down
very
fast
not
terribly
satisfying
unfortunately
very
fresh
and
crisp
drinker
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
an
apa
not
the
most
magnificent
ive
had
but
certainly
not
one
to
scoff
at
i
will
likely
be
trying
this
again
in
the
future
not
bad
but
given
the
option
one
would
surely
be
better
off
trying
a
pale
from
another
brewery
or
another
offering
from
troegs
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
lot
of
taste
because
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
i
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
however
the
beer
still
provides
plenty
of
taste
to
keep
you
wanting
to
drink
more
d
drinkable
could
have
a
few
of
these
a
solid
pale
ale
classic
northwest
hops
with
a
fairly
balanced
malt
profile
clean
and
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
its
a
remarkable
simple
beer
but
sometimes
thats
what
youre
looking
for
it
was
also
free
from
the
bar
so
that
helps
too
troegs
cant
make
a
bad
beer
perfect
session
ipapa
that
easily
is
up
there
with
sierra
nevada
or
other
standards
overall
this
one
is
a
bit
watery
and
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
in
the
after
taste
moderately
dry
in
the
after
taste
it
also
has
a
bitter
twang
with
a
slight
metallic
edge
this
isnt
offputting
but
isnt
exactly
what
im
looking
for
either
in
the
end
it
does
go
down
easy
and
i
could
follow
it
up
with
more
if
i
had
another
bottle
to
do
so
as
is
this
is
a
good
apa
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
definitely
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
well
balanced
more
mild
pale
ale
compared
to
some
others
that
ive
had
adequate
finger
plus
head
of
mixed
bubble
sizes
fades
quickly
with
haphazard
streaks
of
lacing
left
behind
clear
golden
orange
color
a
mild
haze
does
not
impair
transparency
not
many
visible
bubbles
within
mostly
sweet
nose
grainy
hops
and
cereal
vague
swipe
of
orangelemon
citrus
softly
floral
but
no
pine
notes
while
not
that
much
malt
or
cocoa
evident
does
end
on
a
creamy
note
mediumbodied
the
foaminess
lends
a
fluffy
cushion
to
the
mouth
feel
raises
the
sour
dough
raw
bread
up
off
the
palate
and
into
the
swirl
above
where
the
sourness
is
less
present
not
much
fruit
peach
pit
apple
or
pear
skin
raw
grains
oats
wheat
not

though
dryness
here
eliminates
much
of
any
maltiness
keeps
good
balance
as
it
nears
the
finish
not
a
lot
going
on
but
it
does
stay
on
point
and
nothing
stands
out
awkwardly

d
awesome
brew
probably
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
all
damn
night
cheers
i
had
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
the
bottle
poured
out
a
very
light
golden
colored
ale
there
as
actually
a
very
nice
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
hopped
and
consistent
throughout
the
first
taste
mid
taste
and
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
fairly
watery
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
firm
i
really
dig
the
flavor
on
the
ale
perfect
blend
of
citrus
hops
that
finish
just
slightly
bitter
and
eversweet
malts
that
gives
this
a
nice
honey
grahamlike
quality
this
is
very
well
done
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
locally
as
i
would
make
this
a
regular
in
the
fridge
d
a
slight
let
down
based
on
a
very
promising
appearance
and
aroma
a
big
let
down
based
on
the
fact
the
troegs
is
among
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
brew
falls
terribly
short
tröegs
consistantly
makes
quality
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
d
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
didnt
wow
but
didnt
disappoint
out
of
hopback
amber
at
the
store
decided
to
go
with
the
pale
pours
clear
and
golden
into
an
english
pint
very
impressive
head
and
excellent
retention
light
grain
and
barley
aroma
slight
herbal
hop
flavor
but
mostly
a
grainy
sort
of
finish
maybe
a
little
toffee
or
biscuit
nice
smooth
and
sturdy
mouthfeel
really
refreshing
wish
this
was
maybe
a
bit
more
crisp
and
a
little
more
hop
zip
to
it
but
overall
a
nice
english
style
pale
ale
d
a
well
brewed
apa
and
smooth
enough
to
want
another
im
a
huge
troegs
fanboy
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
may
be
unfairly
comparing
this
in
my
mind
to
their
hopback
or
their
nectar
which
i
think
are
outstanding
this
is
a
decent
little
pale
but
there
are
better
representatives
of
the
style
d
a
good
session
beer
that
would
be
appealing
to
a
wide
range
of
craft
beer
fans
and
new
bmc
converts
overall
tröegs
pale
ale
is
better
than
average
but
not
remarkable
i
wont
regret
it
but
i
dont
expect
to
remember
it
in
the
morning
overall
a
decent
pale
i
would
be
glad
to
see
it
at
a
bar
or
a
party
that
lacked
other
craft
options
but
probably
will
not
seek
it
out
or
choose
it
over
too
many
other
craft
brews

i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
didnt
strike
me
as
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
it
just
seemed
like
a
plain
pale
ale
d
very
high
very
good
brew
and
would
be
happy
to
have
more
than
one
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
of
the
best

this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
would
buy
a
bunch
of
other
beers
instead
of
this
one
a
growler
purchased
fresh
from
the
brewery
taproom
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
bright
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
off
white
head
the
foam
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
malt
citrus
such
as
grapefruit
and
lemon
caramelized
grains
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
crispdrinkable
and
very
fresh
tasting
not
really
a
memorable
pale
ale
however
there
is
nothing
quite
unpleasant
about
this
offering
either
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
very
drinkable
fresh
hop
flavor
in
the
tastesomewhat
prickly
in
a
pine
needle
sort
of
way
good
malt
base
closer
to
a
amber
ale
on
the
malt
side
the
body
is
thinner
than
i
would
expect
but
that
may
be
the
only
distraction
this
is
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
nice
head
but
it
leaves
pretty
quickly
color
is
of
a
normal
pale
ale
a
light
golden
beer
with
nice
small
carbonated
bubbles
rising
quickly
the
nose
is
of
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
is
of
the
hops
but
it
is
very
mild
and
good
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
pretty
much
all
day
very
light
and
tasty
but
not
heavy
at
all
an
awesome
beverage
this
and
the
hopback
amber
go
hand
and
hand
great
combination
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
the
best
wouldnt
call
it
the
worst
d
decent
i
cant
help
but
think
that
a
little
more
bitterness
would
lend
balance
and
increase
the
drinkability
though
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
d
leans
towards
ipa
but
a
very
mild
one
malts
and
hops
have
good
flavor
and
presence
but
arent
overwhelming
a
good
springsummer
pale
ale
pales
in
comparison
to
the
other
troegs
ive
tried
but
mainly
because
the
others
were
that
good
i
can
imagine
troegs
sells
a
lot
of
this
stuff
most
pale
ales
on
the
market
really
are
nowhere
near
this
pleasing
its
surprisingly
uncommon
to
come
across
such
a
fine
example
of
this
dreadfully
common
style
although
a
simple
beer
like
this
really
doesnt
show
off
all
the
brewers
talents
it
certainly
shows
their
skill
thanks
drjay
d
the
best
word
to
describe
this
beer
is
refreshing
i
could
drink
these
all
night
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
this
beer
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
d
something
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
d
i
cant
hide
my
love
of
troegs
beers
a
pale
ale
that
would
be
an
ipa
for
other
brewers
but
not
so
hoppy
that
its
overwhelming
just
delicious
straight
up
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
way
above
average
so
happy
to
see
tröegs
in
my
area
now
brew
poured
to
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
fairly
good
sized
off
white
head
that
had
great
staying
power
real
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
at
first
is
all
hops
very
inviting
cascade
smell
that
reminds
me
of
fresh
hop
leaves
almost
the
aroma
from
the
remnants
in
the
primary
of
a
homebrewed
pale
or
ipa
while
that
is
the
dominant
aroma
i
am
picking
up
a
slight
background
malt
aroma
that
comes
across
a
little
sweet
the
flavor
is
nice
again
hops
come
to
mind
at
first
but
i
am
also
picking
up
a
tea
like
flavor
maybe
i
am
crazy
but
that
flavor
goes
extremely
well
with
this
brew
some
malt
there
as
well
roasted
profile
the
hops
that
i
noticed
at
first
are
dominant
but
not
overly
as
the
flavor
breaks
and
does
not
remain
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
finish
is
relatively
dry
which
is
nice
for
this
brew
i
like
brew
a
lot
as
the
aroma
taste
feel
and
drinkability
are
hight

me

held
well

was
gone

light
golden
color
taste
is
not
as
hoppy
as
the
smell
very
light
bodied
and
i
get
a
lot
of
wetness
rather
than
flavor
i
understand
its
an
apa
and
not
an
ipa
but
i
felt
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
body
and
balance
to
it
easy
drinker
though
and
a
solid
beer
just
not
one
of
their
best
pours
clear
golden
with
delicate
frothy
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
delicate
and
grainy
like
a
good
pilsner
the
flavor
is
strong
pale
malt
a
little
bready
with
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
taste
of
floral
hops
there
is
a
trace
of
bitter
lemon
and
apple
the
overall
effect
is
crisp
with
a
slight
clingy
mouthfeel
quote
refreshing
and
an
excellent
session
beer
all
in
all
a
good
apaall
the
right
components
just
not
enough
of
each
to
make
it
great
d
could
easily
make
this
a
session
beer
the
perfect
blend
of
flavors
to
create
a
great
pale
ale
drinkability
i
will
have
this
again
and
could
pick
up
a
six
i
like
this
much
better
than
their
amber
which
i
believe
has
similar
qualities
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
a
complex
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
clear
golden
amber
a
one
finger
frothy
white
head
with
nice
retention
thick
sticky
lacing
coated
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
nose
is
of
citrus
and
floral
notes
i
can
make
out
slight
sweet
malts
taste
is
muted
sweet
initial
hit
of
citrus
gives
way
to
the
bitterness
in
the
hops
and
on
the
back
end
the
malts
even
it
out
this
beer
definitely
has
an
arc
to
it
as
you
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
and
crisp
lighter
bodied
another
nice
offering
from
troegs
this
is
session
worthy
beer
for
me
drinkability
is
top
notch
keep
this
around
for
good
times
with
friends
and
food
i
highly
recommend
this
one
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
mild
but
hoppy
beer
to
drink
for
a
very
long
time
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
smooth
body
decent
carbonation
a
malty
backbone
a
slightly
saltene
character
towards
the
finish
there
are
some
florals
present
in
the
beer
it
is
quite
sweet
in
fact
there
is
very
little
drying
notes
present
there
is
a
slight
tartness
from
the
hops
but
there
really
is
nothing
of
the
estery
hop
oils
present
in
the
beer
its
a
decent
apa
worth
trying
but
nothing
really
stands
out
here
the
beer
isnt
overly
complex
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
some
light
orange
hues
tangerine
very
thick
one
finger
white
head
forms
very
tight
and
compact
drops
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
and
ring
leaves
behind
some
nice
sheets
of
lacing
smell
is
nice
very
citric
some
lemons
and
tangerines
very
light
grapefruit
tartness
not
a
lot
of
malt
but
a
light
bit
of
toast
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
honey
like
sweetness
in
the
back
nice
balance
doesnt
blow
your
nose
off
with
hops
taste
is
similar
quite
light
in
flavour
but
refreshing
some
toasty
malt
and
light
caramel
sweetness
at
first
followed
by
grapefruit
and
a
lemony
acidity
a
bit
of
fruity
tartness
in
the
finish
has
a
strange
ironorange
peel
flavour
in
the
finish
lightly
bitter
moutfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
a
bit
too
high
makes
it
rough
on
the
palate
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
i
like
the
real
citrusy
hopping
but
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
too
high
for
my
liking
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
little
lacing
smells
hoppy
almost
pine
forest
hoppy
not
citrus
hoppy
taste
is
very
piney
it
mellows
into
biscuity
malts
by
the
end
supprisingly
i
thought
that
this
was
more
bitter
than
the
hopback
amber
but
not
as
delicious
it
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
a
few
of
these
would
disappear
into
my
belly
in
no
time
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
first
troegs
notes
standard
apa
here
nothing
over
the
top
but
still
pretty
good
drinkability
a
quaffable
pale
ale
occupying
a
very
versatile
place
good
in
any
weather
and
an
excellent
accompanyment
for
many
foods
a
solid
apa
but
nothing
to
get
worked
up
about
either
this
beer
is
quite
tasteful
is
really
drinkable
and
crisp
a
great
beer
from
pa
overall
1
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
i
slammed
this
1
a
bad
bottle
i
presume
years
ago
but
have
done
a
180
since
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
onefinger
white
head
some
lacing
smell
is
mainly
citrusy
hops
with
a
hint
of
wheat
the
taste
begins
with
lots
of
bitter
cascade
hops
then
a
slight
malt
compliment
mouthfeel
is
crisp
acidic
overall
a
pretty
good
apa
but
not
as
flavorful
as
many
that
are
out
there
a
classic
fantastic
example
of
the
style
nothing
fancy
just
good
damn
good
poured
orange
with
a
head
constantly
replenished
by
active
bubbling
mildly
hoppy
aroma
not
this
beers
strong
suit
the
taste
is
initially
bitter
and
fades
into
a
nice
balance
with
a
yeasty
finish
this
is
a
fabulously
rich
and
rewarding
beer
which
i
enjoy
in
almost
all
seasons
and
circumstances
perhaps
my
favorite
all
around
choice
would
absolutely
buy
again
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
poured
a
pale
golden
colour
with
plenty
of
frothy
lacing
smell
of
lemon
zest
and
citrusy
hops
taste
is
very
subtle
with
a
little
of
the
hops
coming
through
very
similar
to
other
pale
ales
mouth
feel
is
very
light
and
one
bottle
was
watered
down
while
the
other
seemed
fresh
all
in
all
i
would
buy
this
again
for
a
good
session
beer
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
golden
straw
in
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
touch
of
lemon
zest
and
hops
are
the
feature
title
gulp
good
mouthfeel
upon
entry
crisp
in
nature
very
refreshing
a
good
session
beer
all
the
way
recommended
to
those
who
can
handle
a
medium
hoped
beer
will
be
drinking
more
troegs
in
the
near
future
this
was
a
great
introduction
beer
to
test
the
waters
on
pours
a
golden
color
not
very
deep
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
and
just
a
bit
of
head
nice
hoppy
scent
a
bit
floral
although
a
little
unbalanced
nice
taste
crisph
with
nice
hops
although
the
hop
mixture
seemed
a
bit
odd
to
me
mixture
of
english
and
american
hops
goes
down
fine
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
any
time
even
if
its
not
the
best
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
not
extremly
complexbut
good
solidnot
really
standout
toss
me
a
stone
pale
ale
d
for
hops
fanatics
im
sure
its
a
session
beer
for
me
its
this
one
to
try
it
and
im
usually
a
huge
troegs
fanatic
ill
stick
to
their
hopback
ale
d
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
i
would
make
a
great
session
brew
taste
is
big
on
the
citrusy
hops
grapefruits
seem
to
come
about
well
balanced
though
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
im
not
a
hop
head
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
am
starting
to
really
appreciate
hops
i
hope
that
i
can
start
enjoy
some
of
the
real
hoppy
beers
out
there
in
the
near
future
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
big
head
that
left
sheets
on
my
pint
glass
the
hops
really
are
prevalent
as
expected
smelled
very
strong
of
flowerspinegrapefruit
the
beer
was
slightly
bitter
but
very
well
balanced
and
kept
me
wanting
more
i
really
could
sit
back
with
a
six
of
these
and
watch
some
football
or
hockey
pours
macroyellow
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
with
a
little
more
golden
depth
to
it
some
head
and
some
lacing
stay
with
the
beer
a
couple
minutes
after
the
pour
but
not
much
aroma
is
very
pilsnerlike
with
most
of
the
aroma
coming
from
the
base
malt
instead
of
the
specialty
malts
very
light
and
clean
almost
cornlike
taste
is
well
not
very
pale
ale
like
more
like
a
pilsner
with
slightly
more
body
soft
2row
taste
with
the
mineralfree
water
quality
to
go
with
it
soft
flavor
of
aroma
hops
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
cascade
in
there
well
balanced
but
slightly
watery
and
not
true
to
style
overall
a
generally
above
average
beer
in
terms
of
brewing
technique
but
i
think
theyre
a
little
confused
on
their
definition
of
an
apa
this
is
a
very
quaffable
pale
ale
that
is
very
flavorful
despite
its
lack
of
complexity
the
flavor
actually
suffers
a
little
as
the
ale
warms
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
smells
hoppy
pine
forest
hoppy
not
citrus
hoppy
ive
been
having
a
lot
of
beers
lately
where
the
malt
is
followed
by
the
hops
in
the
taste
department
this
one
kind
of
flips
the
script
slammed
into
a
pine
tree
at
first
sip
it
mellows
into
biscuity
malts
by
the
end
i
like
it
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
or
even
the
best
from
troegs
no
but
it
is
an
extremely
solid
effort
and
very
sessionable
a
few
of
these
would
disappear
into
my
belly
in
no
time
this
is
a
great
offering
from
troeg
the
beer
pours
a
wonderful
golden
copper
color
with
a
bone
white
head
the
taste
up
front
is
spicy
pine
hops
but
after
that
you
get
a
nice
subtle
malty
taste
the
aroma
is
the
same
spicy
hops
with
subtle
malts
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
sure
almost
and
ipa
in
its
hop
drinkability
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
thanks
again
dain
an
amber
color
with
touches
of
gold
along
the
sides
od
the
glass
about
a
half
inch
high
head
forms
cream
in
color
showing
tremendous
retention
at
first
scent
you
are
hit
with
the
strong
aroma
of
grapefruit
citrus
fragrance
along
with
with
a
grassy
aroma
there
is
also
the
feint
scent
of
malty
mildness
finishing
off
the
aroma
that
malt
comes
out
at
the
front
of
each
taste
mild
in
flavor
almost
like
a
light
to
bland
bread
flavor
then
as
it
reaches
the
halfway
point
the
hops
take
over
with
grassy
earthy
flavors
at
first
then
finishing
with
a
grapefruit
bitterness
a
light
to
medium
bodied
feel
light
at
the
front
and
gaining
weight
as
it
crosses
the
palate
this
is
a
solid
if
not
a
very
good
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drinkplus
you
can
throw
this
at
many
different
dishes
and

a
crystal
clear

with
a
two

fluffy
white

down
to
a

that
lasts
throughout
spotty
chunky
webbing
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
light
pine
and
fresh
citrus
up

in
the
nose
with
a
good
dose
of
floral
hops
as
well
nice
balancing

in
the

taste
starts
off
with
pine
and
herbal
hops
with
some
bready
characteristics
toasted
grains
and
biscuit
flavors
midway
with
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
aftertaste

sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
light
to
medium
body
with
a
crisp
feel
and
a
solid
carbonation
this
is
what
an

thanks
a
lot
sean
drinkability
you
cant
really
taste
the
5
alcohol
but
after
two
or
three
the
unexpected
sweeter
side
of
this
beer
would
get
to
you
d
this
one
has
the
flavor
almost
like
an
ipa
with
a
lightness
of
a
lighter
beer
refreshing
and
somewhat
bracing
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
want
more
looking
at
the
website
this
beer
is
like
12
pils
liberty
pils
malt
and
12
apa
cascade
crystal
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
indeed
d
acceptable
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
ill
drink
this
if
its
around
but
i
dont
think
ill
bother
to
seek
it
out
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
though
it
didnt
wow
me
in
any
particular
way
not
bad
though
d
very
nice
drinkability
owing
itself
mostly
to
the
crispness
and
not
having
too
strong
of
a
bitter
hop
flavor
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
at
any
meal
or
just
sitting
around
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
the
light
active
body
with
the
balanced
flavors
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
all
night
in
fact
i
have
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
hop
freshness
off
set
by
just
enough
malt
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
completely
refreshing
and
a
great
value
this
pale
ale
has
a
pale
goldeny
coppery
color
thats
partly
cloudy
with
a
very
light
head
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
light
flowery
hops
the
taste
is
light
and
has
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
it
tastes
just
like
it
smells
good
the
mouthfeel
is
good
light
in
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
this
is
such
a
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
i
could
definitely
see
this
pale
ale
turning
into
one
of
my
regulars
pours
a
nice
hue
of
orange
decent
white
head
with
good
retention
nice
lacing
smells
like
a
bouquet
of
citrus
hops
lots
of
grapefruit
here
but
nice
malt
undertones
taste
umm
where
did
those
hops
go
brief
malts
hop
bitterness
throughout
but
not
what
the
nose
promised
citrusy
but
not
well
defined
dry
finish
earns
points
in
the
mouthfeel
smell
is
great
but
tasting
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
rock
on
troegs
d
not
great
but
not
bad
d
a
very
sessionable
pale
ale
that
is
hoppy
enough
for
a
hop
lover
and
balanced
enough
for
anyone
at
5

you
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
before
a
good
meal
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
here
very
drinkable
a
nice
sessionable
brew
was
a
great
lunch
beer
with
my
sandwich
i
would
drink
this
one
again
solid
beer
d
a
great
session
beer
with
strong
malting
obviously
yet
pleasant
hoppiness
and
a
little
less
than
medium
body
with
great
aftertaste
this
is
a
special
beer
in
that
it
does
nearly
everything
well
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
cold
off
white
head
about
1
inch
medium
amber
color
with
visible
carbonation
head
fades
to
a
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
fruit
perhaps
pears
and
citrus
tastes
the
same
with
slight
piney
or
citrus
rind
taste
also
light
malt
sweetness
balanced
with
the
citrusy
bite
of
hops
fades
to
a
grapefruit
like
aftertaste
that
does
not
dry
the
palate
overmuch
leaving
the
mouthfeel
as
lightly
creamy
and
full
theres
also
slight
buttery
feel
left
in
the
mouth
and
something
of
pine
or
lemon
rinds
though
its
very
faint
not
bad
brew
and
seems
to
follow
the
style
also
popped
open
a
second
bottle
and
tried
it
with
pizza
and
wings
and
overpowered
it
badlymy
fault
not
theirs
wiedersehen
yall
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
pale
ale
thats
quite
drinkable
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
cask
beers
but
this
was
pretty
damn
good
i
was
quite
surprised
usually
one
and
done
but
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
quickly
disapearing
head
it
left
lots
of
lacing
on
the
sides
the
nose
is
of
floral
hops
and
the
taste
follows
the
nose
it
has
a
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
adequete
carbonation
the
beer
went
down
very
smoothly
overall
a
fine
apa
all
and
all
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
and
a
good
first
experience
with
troegs
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
their
lineup
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
each
night
all
in
all
it
was
okay
i
would
drink
it
again
but
never
pay
for
it
not
a
good
rendition
of
an
apa
bottlecap
is
interesting
with
the
fanciful
troegs
logo
poured
a
goldenorange
color
into
a
pint
glass
a
small
white
head
with
moderate
retention
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
straw
grass
a
little
berry
fruitiness
and
some
yeast
hops
taste
is
like
the
nose
not
overwhelming
with
a
subdued
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thin
as
i
expected
it
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
lightmedium
body
drinkability
is
very
high
especially
due
to
the
hop
character
which
i
enjoyed
as
a
person
who
is
just
starting
to
appreciate
hops
in
beer
another
from
troegs
sampler
case
poured
from
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white
bubbly
head
smell
was
sweet
hops
up
front
with
mild
malt
and
grass
taste
was
hoppy
but
not
as
strong
as
smell
had
me
expecting
with
a
mellow
bitterness
this
was
a
crisp
hoppy
very
drinkable
ale
troegs
has
made
another
gem
overall
not
bad
at
all
here
this
was
a
very
good
little
session
ale
that
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
out
again
some
day
i
would
love
to
find
it
on
cask
to
give
it
a
good
whirl
definitly
worth
another
look
here
overall
its
a
solid
apa
but
nothing
terribly
special
a
good
session
beer
this
beer
tastes
a
little
better
if
you
let
it
warm
up
for
about
1520
mins
out
of
the
fridge
overall
an
impressive
beer
for
a
brewery
im
starting
to
really
like
all
around
a
good
brew
and
worth
a
try
drinks
very
easy
another
winner
from
troegs
nice
apa
d
not
too
great
maybe
it
would
be
alright
with
a
meal
that
you
didnt
want
to
overpower
with
beer
since
its
such
a
light
flavor
doesnt
go
well
on
its
own
at
all
d
i
loved
it
it
had
a
really
unique
flavor
that
i
wasnt
at
all
expecting
but
will
definitely
try
again
this
beer
is
a
winner
whether
or
not
it
is
really
a
pale
ale
is
not
important
the
fact
is
this
brewery
continues
to
impress
me
i
could
see
myself
becoming
a
huge
fan
if
they
were
more
readily
available
in
mass
thanks
to
kidwell
for
sneaking
some
in
d
i
love
this
as
a
session
pale
its
not
always
in
stock
locally
but
often
enough
d
nice
local
apa
that
is
all
too
hard
to
find
on
tap
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
goldorange
color
with
an
inch
frothy
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
aroma
is
mostly
citrusy
and
floral
hops
with
some
sweet
malt
also
noticable
it
tastes
like
citrusy
and
grassyfloral
hops
and
sweetbiscuity
malt
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
its
a
little
bit
oily
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
sessionable
i
think
this
is
a
good
straight
forward
pale
ale
its
a
good
all
around
brew
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
the
soft
malt
flavors
and
the
light
hops
note
really
needed
some
nuance
to
it
and
the
biscuit
malt
was
a
bit
to
much
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
this
is
a
sessionable
pale
ale
a
relatively
low
abv
make
this
easy
to
put
down
pretty
good
pale
ale
if
they
tone
down
the
grapefruit
just
a
tad
itll
be
so
much
better
i
had
this
cask
tonight
once
and
for
all
in
patchogue
this
beer
poured
a
light
amber
with
minimal
head
the
smell
was
nice
or
malts
with
a
distant
smell
of
hops
a
well
balanced
cask
with
the
flavor
between
malts
and
hops
not
exactally
something
i
see
myself
drinking
all
night
but
a
nice
representation
of
a
pale
ale
cask
the
mouthfeel
very
nice
but
the
drinkability
was
not
the
greatest
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
translucent
light
copper
with
a
one
inch
tight
offwhite
cap
head
dissipated
quickly
into
a
thin
skim
of
froth
some
spotty
lacing
present
during
the
session
light
floral
hops
aroma
upfront
without
being
overpowering
taste
consistent
with
nose
not
much
complexity
but
extremely
wellbalanced
with
very
little
hops
bitterness
lingering
between
quaffs
and
a
slight
citrus
quality
present
towards
the
back
light
body
with
lots
of
effervescence
throughout
the
mouth
extremely
easy
drinking
offering
from
tröegs
d
very
pleased
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
might
inhibit
my
ability
to
drink
one
after
another
but
it
is
very
refreshing
too
bad
they
dont
sell
this
up
where
i
live
drinkability
is
fairly
high
low
alcohol
makes
this
beer
quite
sessionable
flavor
is
alright
but
not
too
impressive
a
decent
brew
pours
a
clear
light
golden
brown
color
with
a
small
but
dense
cream
colored
head
dissipated
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
nice
and
juicy
hops
grassy
and
fresh
the
taste
starts
off
with
the
grassy
hop
hit
which
is
subdued
by
a
rather
bland
and
watery
malt
not
overly
hopped
for
an
apa
which
is
nice
but
the
malt
is
a
tad
weak
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
with
an
ever
slight
hoppy
bitterness
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
a
nice
hop
profile
but
a
little
light
on
the
malt
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
but
rapidly
disappearing
foamy
offwhite
head
really
good
lacing
on
the
glass
moderately
piney
hop
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
and
plenty
of
malty
sweetness
nice
citrusy
hop
bite
some
biscuitycaramel
taste
wellrounded
good
mouthfeel
with
some
dryness
to
the
edges
you
could
drink
this
with
almost
any
kind
of
food
and
you
could
definitely
put
back
a
few
of
these
a
great
apa
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
will
become
a
staple
of
my
stock
i
would
consider
this
a
pretty
good
session
beer
and
could
definatley
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
one
evening
while
sitting
on
my
deck
the
herbal
and
earthy
hops
come
through
first
with
a
nice
balance
from
the
slightly
toasted
malts
toffee
flavor
noticeable
as
well
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
mediumbodied
this
is
a
very
tasty
apa
without
trying
to
go
over
the
top
with
bitterness
this
one
oozes
with
quality
highly
recommended
as
a
sessionable
pale
ale
drinkability
crisp
and
light
and
easy
to
drink
decent
pale
ale
though
nothing
out
of
this
world
very
nice
golden
yellow
with
thick
puffy
slowley
receiding
head
looks
great
smells
of
spicy
floralpiney
hops
and
sweet
earthy
malts
tastes
of
pineygrassey
hops
up
front
with
a
constant
malty
sweetness
throughout
hops
leave
the
tongue
tingling
for
something
more
in
the
end
nice
lightmedium
mouth
feel
and
a
session
brew
for
sure
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
low
enough
abv
to
be
considered
for
a
moderate
session
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
nose
is
sweet
and
a
bit
hoppy
flavor
is
bitter
and
hoppy
minor
pine
notes
go
against
the
stronger
bitter
tone
very
minor
citrus
as
well
its
bright
and
crisp
feel
has
a
fairly
biting
carbonation
to
it
liquid
is
a
bit
slick
nice
to
drink
definitely
on
the
bitter
edge
and
earthy
would
be
interesting
on
cask
i
bet
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
like
a
great
session
pale
with
a
clean
sharp
citrusy
hopping
that
will
make
you
keep
coming
back
for
more
d
great
session
beer
easy
to
drink
has
a
lower
abv
nice
balance
not
overly
complex
but
one
of
the
better
apas
i
have
had
this
looks
light
and
coppery
with
a
scant
white
head
and
good
lacing
i
note
a
sharp
pine
hops
smell
a
little
unusual
but
nice
the
taste
brings
out
a
fine
hoppy
crispness
with
some
malt
background
in
a
full
bodied
well
carbonated
ale
this
goes
down
real
easy
but
is
a
little
dry
at
the
edges
very
nice
d
would
i
call
this
the
ultimate
pale
ale
absolutely
not
far
from
it
too
thin
for
me
to
be
really
representative
of
style
would
not
tell
anyone
its
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
however
it
is
a
great
beer
its
incredibly
pleasant
and
very
refreshing
i
will
definitely
buy
again
no
aroma
hardly
any
flavor
to
call
it
a
pale
very
drinkable
noetheless
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summers
day
as
a
bud
or
mgd
upgrade
mfd
spicy
and
crisp
with
a
nice
hoppy
oil
feel
leaving
behind
a
sweet
sticky
mouth
coating
once
again
troegs
has
knocked
one
out
of
the
park
they
have
made
a
true
believer
out
of
me
definitely
a
session
worthy
beer
drinkability
an
excellent
session
beer
very
crisp
and
complex
for
a
pale
ale
props
to
troegs
for
their
sampler
case
with
this
one
the
dreamweaver
nut
brown
and
hop
back
it
should
be
called
a
session
case
mfd
a
little
thinner
then
i
usually
like
smooth
and
slightly
oily
texture
above
average
drinkability
good
session
ale
d
i
love
troegs
pale
ale
and
the
dry
hopping
really
kicks
things
up
a
notch
creating
a
very
fresh
flavorful
ale
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
pours
a
clear
and
light
amber
color
with
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
grainy
malt
mostly
with
light
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
smooth
creamy
fruity
malt
and
a
nice
moderate
bitterness
and
light
hop
flavor
but
enough
to
let
you
know
its
a
solid
pale
ale
medium
to
thin
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
is
extremely
sessionable
nice
pale
i
felt
that
this
was
a
pretty
average
pale
ale
its
okay
but
i
feel
its
nothing
special
just
another
pale
ale
the
hops
were
there
but
they
werent
in
the
range
that
i
would
expect
from
an
apa
or
as
balanced
as
an
epa
its
stuck
in
the
middle
i
had
two
20oz
imperial
pints
one
of
the
more
hopcentric
pale
ales
out
there
not
surprising
considering
this
comes
from
the
makers
of
nugget
nectar
and
hopback
good
stuff
and
extremely
drinkable
i
could
see
a
huge
glass
of
this
stuff
doing
just
the
right
thing
for
a
summer
afternoon
very
clear
pale
golden
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quick
but
leaves
nice
lace
nose
is
hops
with
pale
malt
just
like
it
should
be
more
hoppy
than
malty
with
some
nice
citrus
flavors
good
medium
body
but
the
finish
is
quicker
than
i
hope
for
very
good
but
not
stellar
pale
ale
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
stuff
into
a
shaker
pint
at
the
black
squirrel
dc
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
pale
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
subtle
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
earthy
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
citrus
hops
up
front
with
sweet
fruity
malts
and
slight
caramel
right
behind
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
just
enough
carbonation
this
is
a
great
refreshing
pale
that
would
make
for
a
great
session
or
just
a
smooth
nightcap
i
had
no
idea
of
the
abv
until
i
looked
above
since
it
cant
be
detected
at
all
hopheads
wont
go
too
crazy
for
this
but
for
those
looking
for
an
east
coast
version
of
this
style
or
a
beer
thats
great
bang
for
the
buck
look
no
further
than
this
treogs
has
a
light
refreshing
pale
ale
on
their
hands
here
and
this
should
be
an
excellent
warmup
to
their
beer
that
i
will
be
enjoying
by
the
end
of
this
week
great
depiction
of
the
style
a
good
solid
brew
that
seems
pretty
versatile
with
food
nice
representation
of
an
american
pale
ale
without
going
too
far
off
into
the
hop
realm
like
many
of
its
west
coast
counterparts
id
probably
keep
a
sixer
of
these
around
if
they
were
available
in
the
land
of
the
dropped
rs
it
fit
right
in
with
the
rest
of
them
thanks
to

midsized

head
light

and
orangey

by
grassy
hops
light
caramel
sweetness
in
the
flavor
with
a
toasted
biscuit
backbone
there
is
a
light
citrus
overtone
and
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
earthy
hops
that
linger
for
a
bit
lightmedium
body
with
fresh
carbonation
and
oily
smoothness
keeps
this
one
quite
drinkable
not
an
overpowering
apa
by
any
means
but
pretty
much
a
straight
up
classic
d
good
beer
but
i
would
only
enjoy
it
as
a
variety
pack
i
dont
know
if
i
would
purchase
a
six
pack
of
it
on
its
own
i
would
def
have
it
over
a
miller
lite
though
at
the
restaurant
drinkability
high
this
is
an
excellent
session
pale
ale
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
one
not
too
bitter
just
a
spectacularly
balanced
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
tastes
good
and
is
low
enough
abv
that
you
could
have
a
few
it
is
just
a
little
disappointing
in
taste
given
that
other
elements
are
very
good
overall
another
great
beer
by
troegs
that
is
just
so
damn
drinkable
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
just
do
darn
solid
do
we
expect
anything
less
cheers
troegs
pours
a
clear

taste
is

light
in
the
citrus
with
a
pretty
big

a
good
apa
seems
less
intense
than
other
troegs
beers
good
session
beer
easy
to
drink
overall
an
excellent
session
beer
that
isnt
too
far
from
being
an
all
out
ipa
actually
have
had
ipas
that
are
more
toned
down
than
this
pa
again
i
wish
troegs
was
available
in
my
area
or
at
least
upstate
ny
this
is
the
4th
selection
from
this
brewery
and
i
havent
been
disappointed
yetsomeone
find
me
the
nugget
nectar
i
believe
i
have
a
new
favorite
pa
and
would
take
this
over
most
ipas
too
d
very
nice
session
beer
a
fine
example
of
an
american
pa
could
drink
this
one
in
succession
with
ease
final
note
this
was
the
first
tröegs
beer
i
tried
and
now
that
their
beers
are
available
in
my
area
it
sure
as
hell
wont
be
my
last
damn
nice
pale
ale
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
isnt
crisp
enough
for
my
taste
theres
a
great
hops
profile
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
fruity
hops
resin
with
relatively
sweet
grapefruit
and
a
decent
but
not
big
bitterness
there
a
touch
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
in
the
back
but
this
is
a
smooth
odd
but
ok
i
guess
and
hoppy
beer
find
this
and
enjoy
it
cheers
pours
out
a
clarified
copper

a
healthy
white
head

sheets
of
ornate

amazing
balance
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
nose
loads
of
grapefruit
with
undertones
of
grass
and
a
sweet
caramel
maltiness
lots
of
caramel
toffee
and
hinted
at
toast
in
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
its
hard
to
say
when
the
hop
presence
comes
in
as
everything
melds
together
so
well
some
citrus
and
modest
pine
drying
finish
body
is
moderate
and
with
mild
soft
bubbles
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
and
really
reminded
me
of
how
good
a
pale
ale
can
be
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
a
clean
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
american
pale
ale
but
not
a
great
one
ill
drink
this
if
im
handed
one
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
that
id
prefer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white

rocky
head
the
aroma
of
fresh
hops
hits
the
senses
immediately
upon
opening
the
bottle
the
taste
is
bitter
and
heavy
of
hops
there
is
enough
sweetness
in
the
malt
to
balance
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
this
is
a
very
clean
and
easily
drinkable
beer
pours
out
a
clarified
copper
with
a
healthy
white
head
and
sheets
of
ornate
lacing
amazing
balance
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
nose
loads
of
grapefruit
with
undertones
of
grass
and
a
sweet
caramel
maltiness
lots
of
caramel
toffee
and
hinted
at
toast
in
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
its
hard
to
say
when
the
hop
presence
comes
in
as
everything
melds
together
so
well
some
citrus
and
modest
pine
drying
finish
body
is
moderate
and
with
mild
soft
bubbles
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
and
really
reminded
me
of
how
good
a
pale
ale
can
be
youre
probably
a
pretty
happy
person
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
bottle
after
bottle
with
hot
wings
pizza
burgers
ect
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
mildly
hoppy
beers
that
can
be
enjoyed
at
anytime
its
well
balanced
and
super
tasty
all
around
its
what
youd
expect
from
a
pale
ale
great
beer
cloudy
light
caramel
colour
with
a
whitish
head
awesome
retention
and
the
lacing
was
solid
foam
that
formed
rings
at
each
sip
citrusy
aroma
grapefruit
and
mild
orange
with
a
hint
of
malt
quite
a
mild
flavour
with
mediumlow
bitterness
balanced
malt
sweetness
with
mild
citrus
hopping
a
little
watery
and
thin
very
low
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
but
seems
to
need
some
extra
carbonation
to
prop
up
the
body
ill
try
it
again
in
bottles
or
draft
to
see
how
that
changes
things
first
heard
of
this
brewery
from
brother
jer
12
oz
bottle
from
a
sampler
poured
into
a
shaker
solid
copper
body
with
even
strong
twofinger
headattractive
indeed
appropriate
hops
though
understated
a
palate
approach
that
rivals
sierra
nevada
a
solid
taste
that
softens
with
each
sip
enjoyable
from
top
to
bottom
d
the
smooth
balanced
taste
and
nice
mouthfeel
make
this
one
a
winner
i
imagine
that
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
so
this
is
a
really
good
beer
gently
bitter
not
too
sweet
not
too
strong
very
pleasant
going
down
id
like
to
see
them
experiment
a
little
go
crazy
i
mean
theyre
obviously
good
brewers
d
this
was
a
great
cask

smooth
and
creamy
with
a
refreshing

solid

flavor
supports
with
enough
malt
to
keep
it
interesting
moderately
complex
and
less
sweet
in
a
good
way
than
many
brews
in
the
style
one
of
the
better
aipas
especially
for
the
price
that
ive
sampled
on
the
east
coast
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
not
a
major
detraction
very
well
balanced
with
good
hop
bitterness
for
finishing
well
rounded
and
smooth
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
as
a
session
beer
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
great
aipas
but
its
a
very
good
beer
and
well
worth
keeping
around
and
serving
to
guests
d
very
smooth
with
good
flavor
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again

a
very

poured
a
12

into
a

a
light
amber
color
that
was
pleasant
to
watch
with
pretty
good
carbonationa
nd
a
good
solid
halfinch
white
head
the
head
was
nice
thick
and
foamy
and
retained
throughout
the
entire
beer
which
was
quite
nice
smell
was
a
little
hoppy
not
overbearing
at
all
malts
were
also
very
prevalant
providing
a
nice
balance
taste
was
about
the
same
although
the
malts
were
more
evident
than
the
hops
which
was
a
little
surprising
as
i
drank
the
beer
more
the
hops
began
to
come
out
more
to
provide
the
nice
balance
to
the
malts
that
i
had
expected
in
the
first
place
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
nice
and
fullbodied
not
very
thick

thin
at
all
pretty
drinkable

nice

another

from

is
an

left
plenty

a
clean

is
excellent

some

just
a

the

on

heavy
side

medium
maybe
it
was
too
cold
with
a

this
is
a
very
drinkable

it
is
right
up
there
with

in

opinion
a
nice
payoff
from

bet
taste
is
highly
reflective
of
the
aroma
nice
fruitycitrusy
hop
flavors
on
top
of
a
sufficient
malt
backbone
medium
carbonation
and
medlight
bodied
ale
a
little
hoppier
than
most
pale
ales
im
already
accustomed
to
but
goes
down
easy
and
still
very
well
balanced
nonetheless
my
mouth
is
watering
for
another
and
i
believe
this
would
make
a
terrific
session
beer
very
well
rounded
brew
pours
clean
and
crisp
with
a
very
decent
sized
head
crips
aromas
of
slight
citrus
hops
and
a
very
clean
crystal
malt
great
carbonation
though
it
seems
heavier
than
other
pales
slightly
sticky
on
the
mouth
nice
balance
of
fruity
malts
and
a
dry
hopped
finish
excellent
refreshing
and
definately
a
go
to
for
a
sessionable
beer
a
very
good
beer
i
go
all
the
way
pa
to
get
this
stuff
this
a
must
try
beer
a
decent
session
ale
a
bit
imbalanced
for
the
style
it
almost
begs
to
be
an
ipa
but
doesnt
quite
make
it
easy
to
drink
especially
if
you
like
hoppier
pale
ales
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
leaving
some
lacing
smell
is
rather
weak
i
think
its
trying
to
be
citrusy
but
just
not
really
succeeding
taste
is
much
of
the
same
it
has
stuff
going
on
but
its
just
not
very
flavorful
and
good
things
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
had
average
carbonation
drinkability
was
merely
meh
i
could
finish
it
but
it
just
isnt
something
i
plan
on
having
again
ill
be
sure
to
try
other
offerings
from
tröegs
but
this
one
started
me
out
on
the
wrong
foot
pours
a
great
frothy
head
with
an
awesome
lacing
it
also
has
a
hazy
yellow
brown
color
thats
nice
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
an
underlying
skunk
to
it
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
light
with
a
little
funky
skunk
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
at
the
same
time
not
so
great
i
will
never
try
this
again
md
thick
due
to
dextrinous
character
dang
too
thick
for
the
style
mild
carbonation
put
a
playful
fine
sting
well
done
apa
about
as
good
as
ive
had
of
the
style
drinkability
here
is
topnotch
this
is
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
despite
all
my
gripes
above
i
actually
did
enjoy
the
beer
overall
just
more
the
fact
that
i
didnt
fit
the
style
quite
well
id
definetly
have
another
though
if
offered
though
id
prob
pursue
other
pale
ales
mouthfeel
is
lighttomedium
bodies
tangy
and
little
oily
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
give
this
ale
very
good
marks
for
drinkability
recomended

nice
addition
in
their

courtesy

muenchenerkindl
drink
decent
drinker
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
nice
pale
ale
the
abv
is
5
4
so
its
low
enough
to
session
on
if
you
like
hops
give
it
a
try
the
pour
into
my
sam
smith
pint
raises
a
short
head
off
white
the
lacing
is
sticky
with
skinny
lines
the
beers
color
is
a
light
golden
copper
head
retention
leaves
something
to
be
desired
the
nose
is
dominated
by
citrusy
hops
with
just
a
mild
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
nutty
grapefruity
and
mildly
bitter
with
some
acidity
the
beer
achieves
a
very
drinkable
balance
as
it
warms
the
mouth
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
the
carbonation
is
sublime
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
easy
pale
ale
with
some
initial
hop
kick
but
not
much
complexity
d
unique
blend
leads
to
a
very
drinkable
apa
when
you
smell
it
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
the
malthop
flavor
combination
makes
for
an
everyday
apa
the
carbonation
was
not
overpowering
but
made
a
good
drinkability
i
think
im
gonna
have
a
few
more
tonight
drinkability
high
overall
a
nice
low
key
apa
very
very
quaffable
an
excellent
session
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
and
highly
recommended
for
those
of
you
who
are
not
looking
for
a
hop
blast
everytime
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
session
apa
overall
a
pretty
good
interperetation
of
the
style
but
there
are
better
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
drinkability
one
of
the
most
pleasant
apas
ive
ever
hadsession
in
every
way
i
wish
i
had
about
ten
more
of
these
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
though
not
the
most
exciting
pale
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
wonderfully
done
im
very
glad
muenchenerkindl
was
kind
enough
to
send
this
one
my
way
very
drinkable
perfect
for
sipping
on
a
friday
afternoon
after
skipping
out
of
work
early
its

would
go
well

has
never

my
favorite

and
this
isnt
the
greatest
rendition
ive
had
either
leafy
and
plasticky
instead
of
juicy
and
malty
still
a
decent
beer
thats
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
hoppy
just
like
the

so
good

i
could

it
more

that
leaves
behind
nice

great
citrus
hops
smell
that

nicely
with
the

note
that
this
one
must
be
put
into
a
glass
to
really
get
the
citrus
note
out
of
the
bottle
it
becomes
somewhat
plain
but
in
a
glass
it
really
shines
taste
is
just
as
enjoyable
nice
maltyness
with
just
enough
of
a
citrus
hops
note
to
give
it
some
character
clean
dry
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
overall
a
very
clean
beer
that
makes
a
good
session
beer
another
winner
from
troegs
this
is
one
incredible
session
brew
slight
maltiness
takes
the
top
followed
by
an
almost
dryhopped
finish
that
is
smoother
than
hell
nice
cirtusy
piney
smell
to
it
and
a
delicate
balanced
of
great
hops
and
malt
the
taste
doesnt
linger
making
you
yearn
for
the
next
sip
i
just
went
over
to
pa
and
tried
this
at
a
hotel
and
bought
a
case
of
it
if
you
are
looking
to
put
a
few
away
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
session
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
apa
maybe
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
but
still
very
good
overall
a
quite
nice
beer
very
refreshing
have
i
already
said
that
i
believe
the
six
pack
cost
about
9
drinkability
troegs
pale
ale
would
make
a
great
session
beer
highly
drinkable
and
well
balanced
not
one
element
of
this
beer
dominates
the
other
so
the
palate
doesnt
get
worn
out
from
too
much
hops
or
too
much
sweet
malts
at
5
4
abv
i
could
easily
put
these
back
throughout
an
evening
session
a
nice
pale
ale
and
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
another
fine
beer
from
one
of
the
midatlantics
best
breweries
seek
out
and
enjoy
this
well
balanced
apa
this
beer
poured
a
light
orange
there
is
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
semisweet
the
taste
is
bitter
it
is
fairly
smooth
for
the
style
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
there
was
no
harshness
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
a
good
beer
from
troegs
just
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
to
consider
a
session
beer
this
beer
seemed
like
something
in
between
an
english
pale
ale
and
an
american
pale
ale
to
me
the
low
carbonation
and
partial
english
hop
flavor
threw
me
a
little
bit
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
quite
what
i
expected
this
is
one
i
think
i
will
have
to
try
again
to
see
if
i
feel
the
same
way
this
is
not
a
hop
bomb
type
of
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
hoppy
beer
this
beer
defines
the
style
in
my
opinion
overall
not
a
bad
offering
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
though
due
to
the
absence
of
the
bitterness
that
i
alluded
to
earlier
if
looking
for
an
american
style
pale
ale
there
are
better
choices
out
there
but
standing
alone
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
choice
mild
smooth
and
drinkable
that
is
what
this
beer
excels
at
if
i
would
change
one
thing
about
it
i
would
add
more
aroma
hops
but
not
everyone
is
attuned
to
the
west
coast
hopheads
thoughts
on
the
subject
a
good
beer
and
a
good
choice
to
lure
budweiser
drinkers
to
better
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
definately
a
sessionable
beer
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
one
of
my
favorites
to
session
drinkability
a
damn
solid
pale
ale
troegs
once
again
doesnt
disappoint
i
could
certainly
throw
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
without
a
problem

with

this
is
a
really
solid
pale
ale
a
good
easy
drinker
first
taste
was
metallic
had
to
wipe
the
top
of
the
bottle
second
taste
was
of
citrus
fruits
mostly
grapefruit
and
bitter
hops
no
traces
of
pine
syrup
like
i
expected
the
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
with
the
dryness
of
the
malts
in
this
one
feels
crisp
and
big
bubbly
i
like
it
i
dont
care
much
for
pale
ales
but
i
find
this
one
drinkable
remindes
me
of
sierra
nevada
ipa
id
say
this
one
is
good
for
the
style
d
a
nice
drinkable
pale
ale
that
has
a
great
hop
profile
but
doesnt
give
you
a
hop
shock
basically
falls
between
an
average
pale
ale
and
snpa
in
hoppiness
me
being
a
hophead
i
prefer
the
big
hopped
apas
like
sn
or
my
favorite
alpha
king
but
i
know
many
drinkers
who
find
those
too
hoppy
for
the
style
id
suggest
this
brew
by
troegs
as
a
nice
tasting
drinkable
apa
for
drinkers
with
tastes
along
those
lines
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
handpumped
brew
its
solid
enough
bottled
or
on
tap
but
having
it
handpumped
was
the
kicker
if
you
can
find
it
get
it
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
im
going
back
to
get
more
uf
a
pa
session
ale
for
all
seasons
loaded
with
flavor
but
easily
consumed
during
all
night
appalachian
drinking
sessions
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
the
malt
though
subdued
plays
an
important
role
here
it
really
helps
to
balance
the
hops
so
that
they
are
not
too
harsh
yellow
mixes
fantastically
with
gold
and
orange
the
bubbles
bring
excitement
to
the
crystal
clear
body
heady
nice
and
pillowy

slowly
leaving

on
the

bready
character
accented
by
those
fruity
hops
slightly
metallic
in
the
finish
masked
mostly
by
the
faintest
of
bitternesses
like
a
cherry
stone
this
beer
is
one
of
lifes
simple
pleasures
if
hopback
is
medium
and
nugget
nectar
is
high
this
is
a
delightful
low
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
glassy
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
and
even
some
stickiness
smell
is
exactly
what
one
would
want
in
a
pale
ale
hops
over
a
light
malt
base
taste
is
more
of
the
same
fine
malt
and
hop
blend
right
off
the
bat
leading
to
a
crispy
finish
mouthfeel
was
fine
a
medium
and
this
was
an
excellently
drinkable
brew
a
fine
pale
ale
and
readily
available
where
i
live
ill
be
keeping
this
one
handy
a
copper
colored
ale
with
loads
of
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
behind
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
hops
citrus
and
pine
seem
to
surface
the
taste
is
dominated
by
hop
bitterness
that
doesnt
not
fluctuate
fruity
flavors
are
also
present
but
they
are
very
much
secondary
and
take
a
back
seat
to
the
hops
a
refreshing
brew
with
a
dry
finish
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
filled
with
hop
flavor
a
very
good
apa
final
thought
a
classic
session
beer
with
all
the
solid
components
of
a
pale
ale
light
and
tasty
not
too
many
east
coast
pales
can
hang
with
their
western
brethren
but
this
baby
fits
in
nicely
with
those
from
rr
and
stone
many
thanks
to
froggyfrog
for
this
one
a
pale
ale
more
on
the
darker
side
smells
great
with
hops
all
over
your
nose
the
taste
gets
really
close
to
ipa
territory
but
pulls
back
right
at
the
edge
giving
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
instead
of
engulfing
you
excellent
toasty
finish
this
is
a
mighty
fine
pale
ale
and
more
than
worthy
of
its

ah
fresh
hoppy
beer
simple
pleasures
my
friends
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
taste
hops
shine
through
nicely
in
the
flavor
as
well
oily
herbal
and
a
great
mouthpuckering
finish
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
but
a
very
interesting
example
of
this
style
that
may
be
runofthemill
for
some
but
quite
rare
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
its
mild
but
it
is
far
form
wimpy
a
pleasant
pale
that
places
its
poignant
parts
precisely
on
the
palate
it
pleases
plausibly
and
then
you
realize
its
damned
good
and
damned
simple
as
well
the
downhome
flavor
and
simplicity
make
this
about
as
drinkable
as
it
could
get
if
its
something
you
enjoy
of
course
and
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
in
fact
and
i
envision
sessions
centered
on
this
tasty
creation
d
the
taste
does
it
for
this
one
a
solid
apa
one
that
is
hard
pressed
to
be
outdone
in
flavor
it
is
good
for
a
session
beer
and
it
would
go
well
with
food
as
well
troegs
is
a
great
brewery
and
this
the
quality
i
expect
thanks
to
mntlover
for
delivering
this
one
from
the
east
coast
this
is
a
damn
good
pale
ale
hops
are
the
showpiece
here
but
the
malt
supports
it
well
its
clean
fresh
and
very
refreshing
imo
this
is
better
than
snpa
no
kidding
highly
recommended
thanks

i
was
very
pleased
to
find
a
troegs
mixed
pack
during
a
recent
visit
to
pa
and
brought
home
a
case
the
beer
was
a
nice
goldenlight
amber
color
but
the
head
was
pretty
lacking
the
aroma
was
not
bad
but
rather
bland
with
a
faint
hint
of
malt
that
comes
across
more
grainy
i
dont
get
much
if
any
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
though
nice
and
clean
good
crisp
bitterness
coming
through
very
drinkable
overall
this
seems
a
tad
light
on
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
besttasting
pale
ales
ive
had
another
great
beer
from
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
very
drinkable
brew
one
that
was
enjoyed
surf
fishing
swimming
and
with
several
foods
a
good
all
around

and
follows
the

thick

not

enough
to
keep

for
the

of
the

the
initial
taste
matches
the
aroma

with
a
hint
of

quickly
gives
way
to
a

of
sweetness

finishing

am
impressed
with
the
entire
lineup
from

beer

and

i
could
have
a
few
of
these

down

and
quickly
without
becoming
overbearing
in
any
regard
well
done
a
good
pale
ale
but
sort
of
forgetable
i
would
however
pick
this
over
many
other
commercially
available
pales
the
beer
comes
from
merlin48
thanks
for
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
coar
the
beer
the
nose
is
rather
nice
with
a
sweet
citrusy
hop
and
a
sweet
malt
that
gives
this
beer
a
slightly
orenagey
tone
the
flavor
is
slightly
orange
sweet
slightly
citrusy
hop
and
slightly
pepper
hop
as
well
i
like
it
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
like
the
interplay
of
the
sweet
and
hop
flavors
another
nice
troegs
beer
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
highly
sessionable
since
it
is
hoppy
without
being
one
of
those
beers
that
fries
your
tasetbuds
after
half
a
bottle
definitely
worth
a
try
i
admit
i
was
concerned
that
troegs
did
not
have
much
to
offer
but
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
pale
ale
definitely
recommended
overall
a
very
flavorful
ale
that
has
a
great
hop
character
but
remains
very
well
balanced
with
the
tasty
malt
this
beer
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
apas
with
its
great
real
beer
flavor
and
thirst
quenching

a
great

beer
to
kick
back
with
anytime
of

for
any
occasion
whether
to
pair
up
with
some
fine
food

i
love

not
enough
for

to

it
is
just
lacking

flavor
i
will
definitely
leave
this
out
of

i
just
didnt
care
for
this
beer
o
would
have
it
again
wouldnt

for

in

12oz
bottle
mild
nose
hint
of
pine
and
light
floral
notes
slight
taste
of

hops
bit
muddled
tasting
overall
light
on
hops
enjoy
by
still
has
56
weeks
not
too
wild
about
the
flavors
even
a
bit
of
wet
cardboard
in
there
maybe
fresher
or
on
a
summer
day
clean
mouthfeel
in
general
gently
lingering
flavors
unfortunately
some
bit
off
easy
drinking
overall
ok
but
fl
can
do
a
lot
better
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
one
sometime
maybe
in
a
mixed
12
pack
not
as
pale
as
it
should
be
not
sure
of
date
on
bottle
this
pale
not
too
hoppy
not
one
i
would
seek
out
found
out
best
by
12215
so
within
date
i
prefer
to
cook
with
this
vs
drink
it
at

yummm
holy
cascade
this
beer
is
great
for
hopheads
it
looks
fine
smells
better
than
it
tastes
for
a
small
time
hop
guy
like
me
this
beer
is
pallet
scorching
so
be
careful
if
youre
not
used
to
powerful
alphas
overall
is
is
decent
for
great
lakes
crisp
great
hints
of
citrus
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
if
not
my
favorite
overall
a
very
balanced
pale
ale
the
hops
dont
overpower
but
are
still
very
present
in
the
taste
overall
crisp
and
smooth
beer
dry
with
a
light
bitterness
at
the
end
not
a
complex
beer
very
solid
beer
excellent
apa
good
for
a
pale
ale
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pale
ales
the
beer
pours
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
copper
color
that
borders
on
dark
orange
the
beer
smell
has
floral
hop
notes
malt
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
of
earthy
notes
as
well
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
floral
notes
mix
very
well
together
and
very
difficult
to
separate
but
compliment
each
other
such
as
that
it
gives
off
a
nice
sweet
floral
smell
the
smell
also
has
a
slight
yeasty
note
that
comes
off
as
a
sweet
and
bready
note
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
from
the
smell
the
taste
has
a
much
stronger
hop
flavor
which
is
earthy
and
herbal
instead
of
floral
and
the
malt
is
barely
noticeable
while
the
yeast
note
is
stronger
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
medium
bodied
but
on
the
heavier
side
the
beer
finishes
fairly
smooth
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
worth
getting
serving
type
bottle
this
is
my
go
to
beer
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
the
citrusy
flavor
of
hops
it
has
been
an
adventure
to
explore
many
micros
ever
since
this
one
is
very
damn
good
nice
apa
and
very
available
in
my
area
my
go
to
apa
golden
orange
white
sticky
head
aroma
of
light
sweet
tropical
fruit
and
malts
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
fits
well
very
nice
and
flavorful
o
this
is
a
good
one
for
initiates
in
the
world
of
pale
ales
poured
on
tap
into
a
plastic
pint
glass
at
a

with

tastes
of

light

good

good

overall
a
very
good
beer
not
a
complex
beer
but
one
that
is
really
well
doneits
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
overall
tremendously
wellbalanced
apa
with
a
tilt
toward
hops
love
this
beer
and
will
be
buying
again
sweeter
than
columbus
brewing
companys
pale
ale
overall
a
very
serviceable
apa
that
should
be
admired
by
most
beer
drinkers
craft
lovers
and
those
new
to
craft
alike
the
hopping
levels
are
perfect
for
an
apa
leaving
a
nice
lighter
beer
with
considerable
flavor
and
body
without
being
cumbersome
or
abrasive
would
recommend
especially
as
a
cookout
beer
overall
there
is
a
nice
balance
to
this
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
more
will
have
to
put
in
some
requests
with
friends
driving
through
pennsylvania
again
nice
apa
reminds
me
of
a
maltyer
versoin
of
sn
pa
really
works
and
is
defenitaley
solid
overall
just
a
solid
drinking
ipa
i
cant
see
purchasing
this
in
a
six
pack
form
due
to
many
other
excellent
ipa
options
out
there
but
will
happily
take
it
in
a
sampler
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
if
you
are
ever
in
cleveland
stop
in
at
the
brewery
food
is
great
and
so
is
the
beer
this
beer
is
naturally
carbonated
makes
all
the
difference
everything
is
brewery
does
is
great
to
perfect
i
think
im
in
love
lol
overall
a
pint
of
this
would
pair
well
with
a
robust
salad
featuring
mandarin
oranges
or
a
roast
salmon
filet
not
a
beeronly
beer
i
would
advise
having
at
least
crackers
and
preferably
crackers
and
cheese
with
this
beer
somewhat
balanced
in
extremes
with
good
hop
flavoring
character
albeit
perhaps
a
bit
onenote
great
malt
presence
which
was
somewhat
unexpected
fairly
rich
not
as
bitter
as
some
but
just
a
little
more
bitterness
than
i
prefer
the
balance
is
tipped
slightly
to
the
hoppy
side
overall
for
me
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
enjoyed
more
when
i
was
first
getting
into
crafts
now
its
too
malty
and
not
enough
hops
for
my
liking
more
like
an
epa
however
its
still
tasty
and
easy
to
go
down
if
there
were
to
be
a
pale
ale
version
of
victorys
hop
devil
this
would
be
it
great
lakes
is
very
reasonably
priced
in
my
area
so
thats
what
keeps
me
coming
back
to
this
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
i
had
at
my
first
beerfest
and
it
scared
me
all
that
hop
flavor
now
in
the
age
of
ipas
dipas
triple
ipas
etc
it
seems
kind
of
weak
but
its
still
a
good
pale
ale
that
i
pick
up
occasionally
this
ale
is
a
beautiful
light
amber
color
with
a
puffy
but
solid
white
head
nice
lace
the
smell
is
spicy
with
hops
but
has
a
soft
undercurrent
of
pale
malt
nice
the
taste
is
clean
and
slightly
sweet
from
malt
a
little
biscuit
and
a
little
fruit
then
the
hops
kick
in
flavorful
juicy
bitter
hops
they
give
a
nice
backbone
to
the
beer
full
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
one
is
a
treat
a
solid
clean
and
very
drinkable
east
coast
pale
ale
taste
not
cloying
but
a
lot
of
malt
which
i
dont
care
for
i
want
hops
and
this
one
is
weak
on
that
its
just
worthy
of
the
high
praise
but
this
is
my
opinion
and
once
again
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
but
after
drinking
a
lot
of
apas
and
ipas
this
one
is
just
okay
a
deep
orange
pour
with
a
long
lasting
two
finger
head
the
noise
is
mostly
citrus
with
subtle
grass
and
malt
characters
taste
is
well
mixed
with
tropical
citrus
and
malt
notes
it
near
a
medium
body
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
an
overall
solid
pale
ale
that
is
always
a
good
choice
first
this
review
is
caviated
with
the
fact
that
the
best
by
date
that
i
noticed
after
i
began
to
drink
it
was
6
months
old
with
that
said
the
beer
had
a
stale
hop
profile
really
cant
say
too
much
more
except
i
hope
to
grab
a
fresh
bottle
sometime
while
in
va
or
pa
and
rereview
as
other
great
lakes
beers
ive
sampled
have
been
outstanding
so
far
not
the
brewers
fault
im
guessing
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
have
had
this
brew
probably
more
than
any
other
craft
brew
it
was
the
2nd
craft
brew
i
ever
drank
gold
medal
winner
for
a
reason
great
american
pale
ale
that
leans
more
towards
the
english
side
in
my
opinion
add
some
more
hops
and
abv
and
you
got
an
ipa
solid
brew
o
i
had
high
expectations
going
in
also
it
seems
to
be
a
really
beloved
beer
and
i
seriously
doubt
that
this
many
people
are
wrong
i
just
chalk
it
up
to
a
difference
in
opinion
personally
just
not
my
thing
i
recommend
this
based
solely
on
how
much
love
it
gets
from
most
people
however
i
probably
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
o
a
hopdominated
american
style
pale
ale
tasty
enough
apparently
thanks
mostly
to
the
hops
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
leaning
more
towards
the
english
style
o
i
hereby
declare
this
the
greatest
pale
ale
on
the
planet
it
was
one
of
those
there
you
are
ive
been
looking
for
you
moments
were
all
striving
for
the
most
perfect
session
beer
i
have
ever
found
cheers
o
like
i
previously
stated
not
a
hopbomb
to
my
preference
flavorful
enjoyable
but
im
still
looking
for
a
pale
ale
that
will
knock
my
socks
off
otoh
this
beer
takes
me
back
in
time
to
those
first
days
of
microbrewing
when
no
one
was
trying
to
outdo
each
other
for
palateburning
hop
craziness
however
a
couple
in
a
row
builds
up
the
resinburn
a
little
more
than
i
like
and
becomes
palatefatiguing
this
beer
hides
its
abv
and
quenches
a
hopcraving
quite
well
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
an
ok
offering
but
i
really
dont
think
i
would
revisit
this
a
well
made
beer
with
that
beautiful
toasty
malt
pours
out
a
nice
amber
in
color
with
a
half
finger
white
head
with
retention
of
about
15
seconds
smell
is
quite
malt
forward
with
caramel
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
but
it
is
very
slight
taste
is
also
pretty
malt
forward
with
not
much
hops
at
first
but
they
come
through
as
it
goes
down
the
throat
this
as
actually
a
pretty
well
balanced
apa
as
far
as
taste
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
would
have
expected
with
nice
carbonation
overall
im
pretty
surprised
that
i
liked
this
beer
so
much
it
really
is
very
balanced
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
pale
ale
id
put
this
one
right
next
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
as
the
two
classic
apas
that
still
shine
but
that
unfortunately
seem
to
be
forgotten
more
and
more
total
3850
high
c
burning
river
is
a
pale
ale
that
has
a
one
finger
head
with
average
carbonation
following
the
pour
it
has
a
bronze
color
slightly
deeper
than
the
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
this
beer
has
a
strong
citrus
and
hoppy
smell
that
is
consistent
with
the
taste
as
you
taste
the
crisp
bitterness
of
the
hops
will
stick
around
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
pale
ales
o
definitely
my
favorite
apa
a
must
try
for
the
style
o
good
light
citrus
flavor
very
drinkable
nothing
over
the
top
but
certainly
enjoyable
the
flavor
is
a
very
good
mix
of
malts
with
more
of
a
german
toasted
perhaps
vienna
flavor
with
mild
herbal
and
pine
hop
flavors
following
with
some
mild
orange
rind
accents
the
flavor
of
malt
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
the
hops
with
a
generally
clean
yeast
taste
very
nice
dry
finish
with
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
to
speak
of
overall
this
is
a
different
take
on
the
pale
style
with
more
german
type
munich
toastiness
and
more
herbalnoble
type
flavor
than
straight
citrus
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
well
worth
repeat
tastes
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
glass
overall
what
we
found
to
be
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
its
simplicity
through
the
taste
and
aroma
and
its
ease
of
drinkability
while
weve
had
this
beer
many
times
in
the
past
and
enjoyed
it
today
it
seems
to
be
striking
our
palates
at
a
funny
angle
the
aroma
and
taste
both
seem
to
be
wrought
with
a
curious
plastic
component
this
actually
faded
quite
a
bit
with
warmth
but
it
did
simultaneously
reveal
a
heavy
malt
base
which
tended
to
overwhelm
the
hop
components
these
were
also
a
bit
more
bittering
and
puckering
than
we
remember
as
well
but
in
the
end
it
didnt
stop
of
from
enjoying
this
drink
and
leaving
it
with
fond
thoughts
yet
again
my
wife
asked
me
to
buy
some
of
this
great
lakes
beer
i
did
not
realize
it
won
some
medals
and
now
i
see
why
a
great
lower
alcohol
beer
very
smooth
and
everything
a
pale
ale
should
be
i
usually
like
heavier
beers
but
this
one
is
very
good
for
summer
drinking
and
lower
percentage
o
a
solid
wellbalanced
drinkable
apa
a
tad
hoppy
for
my
personal
taste
but
keeping
with
the
style
not
spectacular
but
quite
good
drinkability
this
is
a
top
apa
that
everyone
must
try
and
up
there
with
my
fave
dales
pale
ale
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
id
like
but
some
nice
notes
and
some
interesting
ones
as
well
immediate
taste
of
hops
but
not
too
bitter
citrus
notes
clean
with
no
sharp
after
taste
light
to
light
medium
mouthfeel
very
good
and
worthy
of
a
repeat
sampling
pours
a
deep
gold
with
an
orange
hue
mostly
clear
and
effervescing
good
retention
and
sticky
white
lace
nose
is
not
what
i
expected
weed
like
with
lots
of
bread
and
nutty
malt
character
caramel
citrus
is
there
but
faint
a
little
floral
and
herbal
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
but
doesnt
quite
stretch
out
taste
is
grassy
very
nutty
herbal
with
lots
of
malt
rolling
sweetly
over
the
hay
like
palate
cracker
biscuit
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
orange
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with
just
enough
bitter
hop
oil
and
sweet
honey
on
a
cracker
this
is
a
very
big
malt
pale
ale
that
drinks
lovely
and
smooth
overall
meh
this
one
didnt
thrill
me
there
are
far
better
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
bad
because
it
wasnt
at
all
it
just
wasnt
amazing
o
not
a
bad
apa
this
ones
a
little
old
so
i
gave
it
a
little
leeway
on
the
scores
nice
and
tasty
and
easy
drinking
though
i
really
like
this
pale
ale
its
such
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
hops
the
smell
is
very
distinctly
flowery
and
biscuity
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
taste
reflects
this
but
adds
that
excellent
bitterness
this
is
what
i
want
out
of
an
apa
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
golden
orange
the
color
of
honey
crystal
clear
with
a
mediumthick
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
leaving
some
delicate
lacing
smells
of
clean
malts
with
slight
bitter
hops
in
the
background
taste
follows
nose
clean
and
smooth
malts
with
a
crisp
bitter
hop
finish
that
rounds
off
a
greattasting
beer
a
great
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
put
away
a
6pack
of
these
o
very
approachable
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
its
not
trying
to
be
anything
too
unique
it
is
just
good
o
a
very
good
pale
ale
this
brewery
keeps
on
surprising
me
glad
my
liquor
store
stocked
up
on
this
stuff
a
good
session
beer
overall
a
very
solid
apa
like
i
said
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
snpa
i
would
say
this
is
the
more
eastern
or
maybe
midwestern
version
of
a
very
standard
very
solid
pale
ale
like
a
snpa
highly
recommended
cheers
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
pale
ale
not
to
use
rye
or
toasted
malts
the
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
reminds
me
of
english
style
yeasts
and
it
works
out
nicely
here
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
spot
some
fresh
stuff
on
the
shelves
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
maybe
the
hops
have
faded
with
time
smooth
mouth
feel
moderate
carbonation
floral
taste
and
mild
hop
finish
super
orange
hop
flavor
up
front
with
underlying
grapefruit
notes
hop
flavor
rolls
over
the
tongue
and
stays
consistent
through
out
the
sip
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
sweetness
lingers
but
bitterness
builds
with
each
sip
make
for
quite
a
balanced
beer
goes
down
almost
too
easy
a
solid
pale
ale
but
there
are
better
ones
around
o
this
is
an
exceptional
pale
ale
with
a
pleasant
tantalizing
fruitiness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
fruitiness
complements
the
bready
and
malty
flavors
very
well
drink
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
to
experience
all
the
fruity
goodness
it
has
to
offer
poured
hard
with
only
about
a
finger
of
head
pours
rich
amber
with
standard
im
not
really
impressed
with
the
smell
the
beers
nose
is
a
little
stale
i
almost
get
some
lagered
notes
there
are
additionally
some
bready
qualities
in
the
scent
followed
by
a
mellow
earthy
and
somewhat
mossy
background
the
flavor
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
the
lagered
scent
follows
through
in
the
taste
but
is
followed
by
very
rich
medium
darkness
malt
flavor
there
is
medium
sweetness
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
the
hops
are
interesting
in
this
beer
not
a
large
profile
but
most
present
in
flavor
as
opposed
to
bitterness
or
smell
i
mostly
taste
earthiness
fresh
cut
grass
and
moss
there
is
a
bit
of
fruit
here
too
but
not
a
typical
citrus
hop
bomb
the
fruity
qualities
are
subtle
smooth
and
complex
the
mouth
feel
is
typical
and
wellexecuted
for
an
apa
a
smooth
texture
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
its
not
my
favorite
apa
but
it
turned
out
being
quite
drinkable
and
interesting
o
easy
drinking
pale
ale
well
balanced
crisp
clean
flavors
the
touch
of
diacetyl
doesnt
really
take
anything
away
from
the
drink
o
an
excellent
apa
good
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
will
have
to
grab
this
one
again
12oz
bottle
pours
deep
golden
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
foam
leaving
some
sticky
lacing
citric
aroma
with
biscuity
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
yeast
tastes
are
a
nice
meld
of
toasted
grain
caramel
grassy
herbal
hops
grapefruit
pith
a
bit
fruity
and
some
hoppy
spiciness
on
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
goto
apa
that
fits
the
style
perfectly
personal
rate
4
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
pairs
up
well
with
the
food
served
in
the
brewpub
at
great
lakes
i
think
this
beer
would
go
with
just
about
anything
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
enough
hops
to
be
interesting
but
still
enjoyable
and
not
overly
bitter
this
is
just
about
sessionable
just
a
touch
high
on
the
abv
to
really
be
a
session
beer
big
malt
start
then
funk
followed
by
a
hint
of
pineapple
and
grapefruit
then
floral
with
a
wetbiscuit
finish
a
little
malty
for
me
but
is
balanced
very
nicely
medium
body
for
a
pale
ale
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
beer
overall
nice
hop
with
a
mildsmooth
tangy
malt
finish
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
the
result
is
never
fizzy
just
managing
to
effervesce
slightly
and
gently
foam
the
beer
upon
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
therefore
somewhat
foamy
slightly
creamy
and
generally
smooth
closes
out
dry
bitter
and
slightly
sticky
o
having
tried
a
few
great
lakes
beers
from
a
sampler
pack
im
really
liking
the
products
they
produce
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
pale
ales
that
doesnt
come
off
too
dry
or
masquerade
as
an
ipa
overall
even
though
this
pale
is
malt
dominated
the
hops
still
make
a
nice
present
there
is
actually
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
this
is
a
good
malt
forward
pale
ale
this
is
a
nice
little
apa
a
tad
too
sweet
but
contrasted
well
with
some
building
bitterness
given
the
abv
and
how
easy
this
drinks
i
feel
like
i
could
session
this
though
so
thats
kind
of
cool
that
figures
into
the
higher
overall
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
but
maltier
than
is
standard
for
the
style
highly
enjoyable
great

overall
another
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
that
really
rounds
out
there
mix
pack
isnt
overly
hopping
to
the
point
of
scaring
anyone
away
but
still
has
enough
to
satisfy
a
hop
craving
a
very
simple
but
nice
example
of
a
pale
ale
well
done
something
i
enjoy
and
would
recommend
a
very
good
example
of
a
sadly
overlooked
style
ooverall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale

very
easy

i
got
a
lovely
two

head
with
good

off
of
my
pour
color
was
a
classic
shade
of
deepamber
with
nequality

and
should
be
the
standard
for
lovibond
in
the
style
nose
reminded
me
of
just
how
fresh
this
was
courtesy
of
sundays
visit
to
the
fridge
the
grapefruit
scent
cut
right
through
my
burgeoning
sinus
headache
and
made
my
eyes
pop
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
about
as
perfectly
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
as
i
have
experienced
for
a
while
you
listening
lazy
magnolia
with
your
overly
hopped
deep
south
p
a
finish
was
semidry
as
compared
to
aipas
which
are
my
goto
but
perhaps
dry
when
compared
to
others
in
the
style
i
am
not
a
style
maven
but
i
know
what
i
like
i
like
this
beer
my
name
is
woody
chandler
and
i
approve
this
message
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
overly
hoppy
beers
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
pale
ales
i
have
had
usually
this
style
feels
a
bit
watered
down
and
very
subtle
this
one
is
much
more
in
your
face
it
actually
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
solid
feel
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pale
ale
that
stands
out
from
the
crowd
give
this
one
a
try
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
purchase
this
pale
ale
a
number
of
times
in
the
last
few
years
i
really
enjoyed
a
couple
of
pints
last
weekend
at
yardhouse
in
glenview
il
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
an
easily
drinkable
but
flavorful
ale
i
was
a
bass
ale
guy
for
my
takehome
brand
but
the
new
product
they
make
in
new
york
does
not
taste
like
the
original
pale
ale
from
england
im
looking
for
a
replacement
any
recommendations
oanother
great
beer
from
great
lakes
i
continue
to
believe
that
they
have
the
best
offering
of
micros
in
the
u
s
overall
very
one
dimensional
flavour
if
strong
and
vibrant
hops
mostly
in
the
smell
and
at
the
beginning
of
each
sip
but
then
the
carbonation
tingles
your
tongue
and
you
get
the
bready
flavors
at
the
end
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
recommended
overall
an
ok
apa
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
bitter
spike
in
the
middle
muted
a
lot
of
the
other
flavors
i
like
great
lakes
beers
but
this
one
did
not
sit
as
well
with
me
as
others
have
pine
and
grapefruit
hit
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
then
chewy
malt
bread
notes
gather
to
the
front
finishes
dry
with
bitter
orange
notes
nice
carbonation
levels
keep
the
flavors
lively
cheers
d
one
of
my
favorite
apas
so
farits
not
trying
to
be
an
ipa
up
there
with
alpha
king
i
mean
that
overall
a
good
tasty
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
o
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
lots
of
hops
the
taste
throws
me
for
a
loop
when
it
is
aggressively
hopped
with
west
coast
strains
and
features
the
lemon
and
pine
more
broadly
than
many
beers
labeled
as
ipas
some
respectable
malt
balance
with
round
biscuit
and
yeast
flavors
oily
in
texture
but
pretty
tight
overall
for
a
session
pale
this
is
about
as
flavorful
and
hop
dense
as
you
can
reasonably
ask
for
o
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
floral
hops
i
found
the
grapefruit
pleasant
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
might
ruin
it
for
some
i
would
drink
again
overall
i
want
to
like
this
beer
i
feel
like
it
is
wellcrafted
and
could
be
delicious
to
the
right
palate
but
mine
is
not
that
palate
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
and
foam
head
the
beer
is
not
very
hoppy
but
it
still
somehow
satisfies
my
hop
head
probably
because
it
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
the
hops
are
floral
and
piney
probably
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
had
it
is
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
on
the
stronger
side
of
most
apas
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
amberorange
pour
with
fine
half
inch
head
scent
of
grass
citrus
and
a
touch
of
peat
taste
is
much
the
same
a
somewhat
herbal
tasting
ale
with
notes
of
tangy
citrus
hops
and
pine
mouthfeel
is
thick
for
a
pale
ale
which
is
fantastic
overall
a
well
balanced
and
solid
pale
ale
on
tap
at
oxford
oh
pours
orange
with
a
long
lasting
white
and
creamy
head
nose
is
of
caramel
orange
and
citrusy
hops
body
is
full
crisp
and
creamy
taste
is
a
lot
of
citrusy
hops
caramel
malt
and
orange
fruit
finish
is
long
bitter
and
citrusy
amazing
taste
amazing
balance
of
amazing
pa
a
nice
pale
ale
and
ill
drink
it
again
but
perhaps
because
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
ipaswhile
the
hops
provide
bitterness
to
the
taste
and
balance
the
malts
they
provide
little
complexity
beyond
that
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
but
sticky
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
certainly
hopforward
with
notes
of
grassy
hops
and
sweet
citrus
the
flavor
is
not
bright
and
fresh
but
it
isnt
tame
either
with
a
dull
orange
rind
and
herbal
bitterness
being
contrasted
against
a
bready
malt
sweetness
the
fine
carbonation
works
well
with
the
solidly
resinous
but
not
overdone
body
overall
this
beer
has
substantial
body
and
flavor
but
it
is
also
nicely
drinkable
clear
gold
under
a
solid
offwhite
head
of
soapy
looking
cream
aroma
is
a
blend
of
citrusy
and
floral
cascades
and
more
earthy
leafy
hops
along
with
some
toasty
malts
straightforward
tasty
zesty
citrus
hop
flavor
over
some
cracker
malts
and
a
bit
of
caramel
the
finish
is
lightly
sweet
and
bitter
medium
bodied
and
crisp
goes
down
very
easily
a
nice
wellmade
refreshing
pale
ale
that
as
always
is
best
when
you
can
find
a
fresh
bottle
stellar
pale
that
has
balance
and
mucho
flavor

the
beer
poured
golden
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
light
malt
with
some
fruitiness
and
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
malt
up
front
a
small
rush
of
fruit
and
then
a
big
hit
of
hops
leaving
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
feel
is
light
and
dry
a
bit
over
hopped
for
my
taste
i
could
do
with
more
of
the
malt
and
fruit
a
pretty
typical
hoppy
pale
ale
o
this
is
going
to
be
a
clutch
pale
ale
for
me
in
wv
were
we
dont
distribution
from
many
great
breweries
reminds
me
a
lot
of
dales
pale
ale
with
less
alcohol
warming
great
spring
and
summer
beer
m
good
coating
and
perfect
carbonation
level
very
drinkable
and
light
bodied
o
overall
nothing
crazy
here
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
my
personal
preference
is
apas
that
are
hop
heavy
but
no
complaints
here
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
tasty
sessionable
pale
ale
that
i
could
easily
see
becoming
a
go
to
for
me
if
it
were
readily
available
where
i
live
definitely
worth
a
try
oa
nice
solid
pale
ale
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
although
clevelands
last
championship
in
sports
was
in
the
60s
great

brewery
remains
a
winner
every

with
its
fantastic

so

citrus
pith
grape
skins
bready
malts
with
a
bitter
and
intensely
drying
finish
not
necessarily
a
palate
wrecker
but
i
wouldnt
follow
this
one
with
a
stout
lightmedium
body
crisp
and
clean
and
quite
good
overall
for
the
style
o
a
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
a
very
nice
mix
of
hops
citrusness
and
malt
backbone
i
dig
it
reminds
me
of
the
420
i
drink
here
in
atlanta
maybe
only
better
m
a
bit
grainy
and
oily
but
with
a
very
firm
malt
body
o
a
very
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
pleasantly
smooth
but
nothing
adventurous
here
just
a
good
quality
pale
ale
that
is
very
balanced
it
is
a
good
baseline
for
a
pale
ale
excellent

1

with
good

that
reduces
to

some

on
the

with

alcohol
is

a
slight
warming
after
the

overall
this
is
a
very
excellent
and
balanced
pale
ale
that
is
highly
enjoyable
and
flavorful
o
much
more
toned
down
than
some
other
pale
ales
youll
see
around
but
this
isnt
bad
at
all
a
well
balanced
brew
but
no
thrills
o
very
pleasing
beer
overall
its
easy
drinking
and
quite
flavorful
being
on
par
with
other
apas
at
9
996
will
have
me
reaching
for
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
i
am
more
of
an
ipastout
fan
but
if
i
was
to
chose
only
a
pale
so
far
this
is
one
of
my
faves
although
i
only
think
this
is
my
3rd
pale
so
far
o
another
winner
from
great
lakes
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
pale
ale
it
is
simple
yet
refreshing
and
tasty
well
done
overall
this
apa
is
a
prime
example
of
a
near
perfect
apa
beautiful
use
of
the
hops
and
not
even
an
ipa
all
i
can
say
is
can
i
have
another
please
easy
drinking
overy
refreshing
and
not
too
filling
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
balanced
flavorful
and
refreshing
its
easy
to
drink
though
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
the
drinkability
really
sets
this
one
apart
my
glass
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
certainly
could
have
gotten
a
couple
pints
and
not
thought
twice
about
it
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
something
but
this
stuff
has
a
bizarre
aftertaste
really
enjoyed
the
burning
river
apa
but
i
could
have
gone
for
more
hops
the
smell
was
nice
and
not
overpowering
and
really
set
you
up
for
what
you
were
about
to
taste
the
appearance
was
nice
looked
like
an
amber
ale
but
a
little
lighter
and
didnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
residual
head
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
of
burning
river
is
just
like
i
would
expect
out
of
a
pale
ale
not
so
thick
that
it
makes
it
hard
to
drink
but
thick
enough
that
the
flavors
sticks
to
your
tongue
and
you
can
enjoy
what
you
are
drinking
d
a
spicier
take
for
a
pale
ale
but
interesting
and
very
drinkable
this
one
is
inviting
to
look
at
and
easy
going
down
could
partake
in
a
few
easily
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
long
enough
to
appreciate
it
aroma
is
mild
and
citrusy
on
account
of
the
cascade
hops
flavor
is
crisp
and
hoppy
but
not
overbearing
citrus
notes
are
present
along
with
lively
carbonation
followed
by
a
clean
finish
quite
a
palatable
pale
ale
which
is
a
style
im
not
especially
fond
of
so
take
my
numeric
rating
with
a
grain
of
salt
o
im
standing
by
my
yummy
comment
this
is
one
of
the
better
pas
that
ive
ever
had
and
may
be
a
regular
addition
to
my
fridge
great
lakes
with
another
win
edit
after
a
rerate
im
not
as
high
on
this
one
though
its
still
good
i
suspect
i
got
a
bad
bottle
strangely
it
tasted
and
smelled
just
like
the
wort
i
boiled
a
few
weeks
ago
in
my
first
home
brew
batch
almost
as
if
the
yeast
did
not
get
all
the
way
through
this
most
recent
batch
essentially
tasted
like
slightly
bitter
malt
extract
not
what
i
remember
from
my
previous
experiences
with
this
living
in
michigan
as
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
so
i
downgraded
to
4
1
for
now
was
one
of
my
top
beers
before
would
like
to
try
one
more
time
to
get
things
straight
tastes
change
but
something
was
off
with
the
most
recent
bottle
the
appearance
is
a
nice
clear
orange
color
with
a
great
head
that
lingers
for
a
long
long
time
the
aroma
is
clean
smelling
with
a
nice
citrus
hoppiness
to
it
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
mixture
of
malty
roasted
flavors
with
a
slight
overshadowing
of
wonderful
floral
and
citrus
hops
the
flavor
is
extremely
rich
and
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
light
bodied
this
is
a
wonderful
pale
ale
that
would
be
great
at
anytime
of
year
but
especially
to
welcome
spring
and
summer
in
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
american
pale
ale
good
for
a
few
of
these
o
a
great
pale
ale
one
that
has
both
complexity
and
the
restraint
to
enjoy
all
night
light
to
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
cleveland
staple
when
it
comes
to
easy
drinking
pale
ales
the
body
is
refreshing
and
easydrinking
while
allowing
the
flavors
to
really
come
out
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
fizzy
side
but
definitely
help
to
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
on
par
for
the
style
and
makes
this
beer
a
real
thirstquencher
o
very
drinkable
will
have
to
investigate
that
aftertaste
but
this
is
recommended
nothing
too
overpowering
in
the
taste
department
and
the
hops
are
restrained

o
decent
pale
ale
offering
by
great
lakes
this
one
was
a
little
past
its
prime
i
will
be
excited
to
try
this
one
fresh
post
note
next
day
straight
pore
gave
me
a
much
better
head
and
it
lasted
a
long
time
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
a
really
nice
drinking
pale
ale
something
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
othe
malt
is
noticeable
and
blends
well
with
the
hops
it
is
nice
to
see
a
beer
focus
on
the
malt
and
the
hops
and
blend
them
together
well
o
i
have
had
much
better
pale
ales
but
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
the
bottle
i
got
is
a
few
days
from
expiring
so
i
am
going
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
and
rereview
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
would
like
to
try
it
in
the
bottle
o
good
pale
ale
doesnt
really
stand
out
among
other
pale
ales
but
it
is
well
made
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
hoppy
with
some
a
good
portion
of
grainy
malts
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
clean
a
crisp
with
a
good
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
on
the
lighter
side
and
was
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
its
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
socializing
and
stuff
worth
trying
for
sure
94100
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
apa
hops
will
disappoint
some
but
flavours
are
clean
and
clear
o
this
is
an
excellent
apa
a
lot
of
good
flavors
perfectly
balanced
and
very
well
done
this
is
what
every
apa
should
be
in
my
opinion
cheers
definitely
more
of
an
english
style
pale
ale
with
the
dusty
like
malts
and
just
light
fruity
cascade
hops
in
the
taste
pours
a
tiny
bit
amber
in
color
with
a
receding
white
head
and
inch
tall
smells
like
a
bass
ale
and
tastes
similar
just
a
bit
bigger
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
brings
it
way
down
for
me
weakly
carbonated
fading
to
nearly
flat
as
it
warms
not
a
quick
finish
at
all
even
a
little
brassy
at
the
end
definitely
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
and
definitely
not
my
favorite
great
lakes
brew
but
a
decent
amalgamation
of
the
english
and
american
syles
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
something
from
great
lakes
it
has
an
appearance
of
a
light
amber
tone
with
a
one
finger
had
the
nose
has
pine
and
citrus
hops
while
the
taste
has
quite
a
bit
of
malt
more
hops
orange
and
other
citrus
fruit
mf
is
medium
with
a
nice
crisp
dry
fisish
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
but
nothing
special
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
nothing
special
but
delicious
and
wellrounded
great
lakes
burning
river
pours
a
crystal
clear
goldenorange
color
with
a
large
white
head
smells
sweet
and
citrusy
thanks
to
the
cascades
hop
taste
through
and
through
similar
to
the
nose
sweet
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
and
a
decent
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
end
hoppy
sweetness
and
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
begging
for
another
sip
this
is
one
of
my
top
5
apas
if
you
havent
had
it
get
it
another
knockout
style
by
great
lakes
they
very
rarely
wow
but
are
spot
on
on
style
good
but
not
overwhelming
bitterness
and
a
very
pleasant
brew
overall
another
fine
contribution
from
gl
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
nothing
special
about
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
pilsner
than
a
pale
ale
a
decent
beer
o
obviously
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
burning
river
has
a
lot
of
complexity
for
an
apa
its
versitile
enough
to
slow
sip
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
or
enjoy
at
a
ballgame
in
the
middle
of
summer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
burning
river
is
a
big
apa
that
is
hoppier
than
some
ipas
not
being
a
hop
lover
i
scored
the
overall
rating
lower
than
a
true
hop
head
would
if
you
like
hoppy
brews
this
is
a
must
try
o
solid
pale
ale
would
like
to
try
one
from
a
bottle
overall
its
a
decent
beer
that
manages
to
get
the
job
done
although
ive
had
better
apas
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
gateway
beer
to
anyone
whose
looking
into
getting
into
any
type
of
pale
ale
overall
decent
beverage
that
im
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
that
being
said
i
know
there
is
a
market
for
this
type
of
beer
and
maybe
ill
change
my
mind
once
i
aggitate
it
a
little
to
get
some
carbonation
out
o
i
really
really
wish
i
could
get
this
in
eastern
pa
as
this
would
be
my
goto
pale
fantastic
my
least
favorite
from
the
gl
tasters
pack
not
a
bad
apa
just
not
my
favorite
o
above
average
but
not
monumentally
so
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
that
sticks
out
i
wouldnt
spend
money
on
a
six
pack
overall
definitely
a
good
pale
ale
balanced
enough
but
also
hoppy
enough
to
please
my
inner
hophead
best
pale
ale
ive
had
there
is
just
something
here
that
is
bothering
me
and
i
think
the
age
on
this
is
a
factor
it
is
right
at
the
best
buy
date
so
im
thinking
that
a
month
fresher
could
really
help
here
that
said
this
is
still
much
better
than
the
vast
majority
of
pales
well
worth
seeking
out
and
at
8
bucks
a
sixer
you
just
cant
go
wrong
o
since
i
love
ipas
and
this
is
what
it
takes
like
this
american
pale
ale
was
right
up
my
alley
ive
tasted
some
ipas
that
werent
this
hoppy
well
done
overall
a
nice
tasting
and
refreshing
apa
in
my
opinion
great
lakes
always
comes
through
with
solid
beers
easy
drinker
here
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
i
like
that
its
not
just
focused
on
the
hops
and
has
a
malty
character
to
it
my
first
great
lakes
offering
grabbed
a
sixer
at
whole
foods
this
afternoon
i
missed
the
chance
to
have
this
on
tap
at
tjs
recently
so
im
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
enjoy
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
transparent
amber
color
the
nose
is
a
bit
muted
but
theres
a
very
pleasant
light
citrus
nose
followed
by
some
malt
the
taste
in
this
is
definitely
on
the
malty
side
although
the
initial
taste
showcases
some
nice
hops
the
finish
is
way
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
creamy
with
the
maltiness
mentioned
previously
hanging
around
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
id
like
more
hops
but
this
is
an
apa
and
not
an
ipa
and
it
in
line
with
the
style
a
good
beer
bye
and
bye
overall
drinkability
decent
if
completely
forgettable
middleoftheroad
pale
ale
yet
another
winner
from
the
great
folks
at
great
lakes
a
pretty
well
balanced
pale
ale
for
the
most
part
would
have
preferred
a
little
bit
more
of
a
citrus
hop
flavor
in
the
taste
but
an
otherwise
excellent
apa
will
drink
again
for
sure
mouthfeel
and
overall
light
to
medium
bodied
a
pleasant
and
easy
burn
citrusy
and
appropriately
carbonated
pours
a
clear
deep
copperamber
color
with
a
bubbly
beige
head
that
impales
itself
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smells
of
citrus
light
sweet
fruit
slight
mineral
taste
is
smooth
citrus
with
a
fruity
burnt
sugar
malt
sweetness
good
balance
twinge
of
hops
bit
of
malt
leaves
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
of
every
sip
crisp
carbonation
sticky
resinous
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
semi
dry
finish
good
session
ale
here
overall
a
great
balanced
hop
forward
pale
ale
poured
a
copper
amber
with
slight
turbidity
and
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
moderate
hop
aroma
floral
and
citrus
balanced
with
malt
aroma
clean
malt
profile
citrus
and
grapefruit
lingering
in
the
background
with
a
crisp
finish
on
the
palate
overall
a
very
good
and
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
did
not
personally
find
anything
that
stands
out
about
this
beer
this
brew
pours
the
standard
pale
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
quickly
drops
down
the
aroma
has
some
nice
hops
over
some
pale
malts
but
its
a
little
weak
compared
to
what
id
prefer
the
taste
is
upfront
hoppy
with
plenty
of
bitter
grapefruit
rind
to
go
along
with
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
bubbly
on
the
way
down
the
throat
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
id
keep
in
rotation
if
it
were
local
drinkability
this
went
down
extremely
well
but
it
is
a
rather
big
beer
so
be
prepared
for
that
this
is
not
a
lightdrinker
apa
it
is
a
heavy
thick
beer
that
is
best
consumed
on
an
empty
stomach
if
you
can
take
it
or
if
you
are
just
a
big
fan
of
smooth
hoppy
ales
then
youll
love
this
beer
o
definitely
something
to
add
to
the
rotation
picked
this
up
at
a
sheetz
driving
through
the
buckeye
state
and
would
definitely
buy
again
for
the
same
price
7
996
oi
was
overall
a
little
dissapointed
by
this
beer
being
a
gold
medalist
of
the
world
beer
championships
and
has
over
800
reviews
and
an
a
average
maybe
ill
try
it
again
fresher
i
hope
this
beer
has
a
golden
body
with
a
1foamy
creamy
white
head
on
top
of
it
the
smell
is
earthy
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
balanced
first
the
hops
comes
them
a
little
spiciness
and
then
a
nice
bitter
after
taste
very
nice
mouth
feel
smooth
off
the
tongue
overall
a
good
well
balanced
beer
really
a
damn
fine
apa
worth
checking
out
o
despite
being
over
a
month
expired
this
beer
held
up
well
i
would
guess
the
smell
would
improve
if
more
proximal
to
bottle
date
but
hey
not
in
my
market
solid
beer
nonetheless
taste
biscuity
with
caramel
and
citrus
flavours
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
a
lingering
biscuity
aftertaste
like
good
apas
it
is
hoppy
without
being
aggressively
bitter
o
while
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
isnt
up
there
with
the
better
pale
ales
that
ive
had
overall
this
is
what
ive
been
missing
being
in
china
for
a
year
pale
ales
ipas
dipas
anything
with
significant
hops
character
has
not
yet
made
an
impression
in
china
what
a
welcome
home
supremely
drinkable
the
great
lakes
burning
river
pale
ale
is
another
great
offering
by
the
cleveland
brewery
the
appearance
is
a
rich
clear
copper
color
the
carbonation
is
very
good
that
led
to
at
least
a
finger
think
head
which
laced
thoughout
the
draw
the
smell
is
dominated
by
pine
but
there
is
a
touch
of
smoke
or
roast
the
taste
is
very
good
there
is
a
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
that
keep
the
beer
from
being
too
bitter
the
taste
is
slightly
down
graded
because
i
did
taste
some
alcohol
which
i
though
was
interesting
cuz
its
not
a
high
abv
the
mouth
feel
is
fine
certainly
could
session
without
question
overall
is
is
a
very
good
beer
though
not
as
mindexplodingly
good
as
edmund
fitzgerald
or
dortmunder
this
is
nevertheless
a
great
tasting
pale
that
is
light
and
crisp
enough
to
quench
a
thirst
on
a
humid
afternoon
yet
tasty
enough
to
sit
and
ponder
over
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
stark
white
head
and
some
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
big
piney
and
citrus
hop
characteristic
to
it
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
a
bitterness
due
to
citrus
and
piney
hops
throughout
the
beer
is
bitter
thoughout
but
does
have
balance
with
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
very
soild
pale
ale
the
tatse
is
balanced
and
consistent
throughout
very
good
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
it
fits
great
with
the
time
of
year
very
refreshing
and
just
a
tad
fruity
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
outside
on
a
hot
day
i
just
wish
my
apartment
had
a
terrace
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
have
become
to
enjoy
pale
ales
as
i
age
i
didnt
pay
much
attention
to
them
when
i
first
started
drinking
quality
brews
glbc
have
a
lot
of
great
tasting
brews
coming
out
of
clevelandohio
they
always
leave
me
satisfied
and
i
always
find
myself
buying
more
burning
river
is
another
one
of
my
favorites
and
is
a
true
quality
pale
ale
and
brew
experience
thanks
to
glbc
m
very
well
carbonated
thin
in
a
pleasing
way
that
makes
this
pale
ale
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
evening
o
a
very
classic
tasting
pale
ale
there
werent
any
other
flavors
thrown
in
there
and
other
flavors
werent
dominating
pretty
simple
and
well
balanced
overy
good
apa
definitely
shows
its
pale
ale
characteristics
has
a
balanced
mix
of
hops
and
malts
pours
clear
amber
with
visible
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
head
fades
fairly
quickly
but
initially
it
forms
a
delightful
poofy
layer
aroma
is
nice
and
refreshing
hop
amount
is
just
where
i
like
it
solid
bready
malts
as
well
i
like
the
taste
a
lot
too
great
balance
going
on
here
again
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
right
where
it
should
be
smooth
with
good
medium
body
ill
certainly
pick
this
up
again
it
has
joined
my
list
of
favorite
pale
ales
d
great
beer
even
better
out
of
the
tap
ive
had
this
plenty
of
times
before
while
visiting
ohio
and
if
available
ill
grab
it
strong
but
not
too
strong
hop
flavor
and
perfect
for
session
of
beer
drinking
o
very
nice
summer
beer
or
anytime
beer
really
that
is
simple
to
enjoy
its
not
one
that
you
need
to
sit
down
and
really
chew
over
all
the
flavors
yet
it
still
gives
enough
to
make
this
very
enjoyable
pours
clar
with
a
goldenamber
hue
thick
head
and
takes
a
few
seconds
longer
then
usual
to
settle
has
a
rather
light
hop
aroma
with
a
lingering
hint
of
caramel
and
hidden
sweetness
that
is
hard
to
place
if
this
was
a
blind
tasting
you
wouldnt
know
it
was
a
pale
ale
till
you
took
your
first
taste
the
hops
makes
its
presents
know
but
then
leaves
and
you
are
left
you
the
hops
coating
the
tounge
littl
more
bitter
then
your
usual
pale
ale
if
you
dont
get
great
lakes
you
should
definitely
do
a
trade
to
get
this
its
an
american
pale
ale
at
its
best
and
tastes
totally
unique
at
the
same
time
o
this
looked
and
smelled
a
lot
more
like
an
amber
upon
first
inspection
only
the
taste
really
indicates
otherwise
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
gl
brew
it
was
a
solid
american
pale
ale
that
was
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
perhaps
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
kick
ive
been
on
lately
threw
me
off
on
the
smell
and
appearance
on
this
one
at
first
but
that
is
beside
the
point
i
could
quaff
the
shit
out
of
this
brew
even
on
the
hottest
of
days
cheers
medium
bodied
and
very
hop
forward
with
a
dry
bitter
character
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweet
malt
into
a
spicy
dry
finish
slightly
resinous
with
an
earthy
pine
presence
that
is
balanced
by
sweet
citrus
fruit
hints
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
balanced
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
that
gives
off
notes
of
toast
and
biscuit
seriously
it
looks
good
and
tastes
great
my
neighbor
really
enjoyed
it
and
i
was
very
impressed
as
well
pale
ales
are
very
obscure
to
me
but
this
had
a
nice
flavor
mouthfeel
and
everything
else
to
make
it
a
really
good
beer
my
second
ever
offering
from
great
lakes
now
i
cant
wait
to
try
that
edmond
fitz
but
alas
i
only
have
1
so
it
must
be
saved
for
something
special
a
good
apa
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
it
was
on
sale
i
tend
to
lean
towards
apas
with
a
bit
more
maltiness
when
i
want
hops
ill
get
an
ipa
o
good
solid
apa
very
drinkable
nothing
to
make
it
stand
above
other
apas
but
this
makes
a
great
cold
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
great
pale
ale
mildly
bitter
and
a
nice
malt
balance
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
overall
a
solid
pleasing
example
of
the
style
hop
forward
probably
more
so
when
its
fresh
with
a
zesty
malty
back
o
its
a
very
good
offering
from
what
is
considered
a
very
good
brewery
is
it
the
best
pale
ale
that
i
have
ever
had
of
course
not
but
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
i
wouldnt
reject
if
it
were
offered
to
me
o
i
like
the
tap
iteration
better
than
the
bottle
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
draft
out
in
ca
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
sierra
nevada
however
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
distinct
and
pronounced
this
had
a
nice
smoothness
basically
it
was
just
an
all
around
good
pale
ale
for
the
money
it
cant
be
beat
full
of
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
an
all
purpose
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
probably
my
favorite
pale
ale
and
an
easy
go
to
beer
as
its
local
ive
yet
to
have
a
glbc
beer
that
i
dont
enjoy
had
this
a
million
times
yet
i
had
not
rated
it
yet
hmmmm
i
just
had
the
11
beer
sampler
at
glb
so
i
can
get
caught
up
on
some
of
these
nice
rubygolden
color
with
a
white
head
very
hoppy
aroma
some
light
grass
and
fruits
from
the
malt
as
well
medium
body
almost
an
ipa
but
since
i
drank
the
commodore
perry
i
clearly
seetaste
the
difference
better
on
tap
good
stuff
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
with
a
a
tight
1
finger
head
that
smears
and
laces
around
the
glass
big
sweet
hops
hit
the
nose
very
fruity
mix
of
cherries
and
berries
with
a
bold
malt
and
bitter
hops
so
good
on
the
tongue
the
malts
give
almost
a
woody
and
chocoatly
taste
blended
well
with
distinct
hop
presence
but
not
overwhelming
bready
and
sweet
light
to
medium
on
the
feel
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
awesome
its
a
little
bigger
than
your
average
apa
with
a
little
more
breadiness
and
a
solid
hop
balance
pours
a
deep
yellow
orange
with
a
big
pale
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
thigh
blanket
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
not
overly
complex
like
the
nose
its
mild
citrus
hops
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
nice
lingering
fruit
with
slightly
dry
aftertaste
sweetness
makes
its
appearance
after
half
a
glass
really
pretty
refreshing
on
a
whole
body
is
lightmedium
with
average
carbonation
level
overall
a
nice
brew
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
if
youre
drinking
several
what
is
most
impressive
to
me
is
that
they
managed
to
mask
a
6abv
so
damn
well
one
could
easily
approach
this
as
a
session
beer
only
to
realize
five
beers
late
they
can
barely
get
off
the
couch
o
a
good
offering
from
my
favorite
brewery
but
alas
not
quite
my
favorite
from
their
lineup
fairly
pedestrian
but
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
recommended
but
id
prefer
a
more
complex
brew
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
o
a
good
beer
allaround
but
not
in
the
great
category
for
the
style
needs
more
malt
depth
or
hops
uniqueness
to
really
bump
up
to
the
next
tier
overall
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
a
solid
and
representative
american
pale
ale
recommended
overall
its
a
good
beer
if
gl
was
available
to
me
id
pick
it
up
again
for
sure
really
solid
pale
ale
different
than
most
west
coast
pale
ales
really
liked
this
interpretation
drinkability
while
refreshing
and
mellow
the
nose
indicated
a
more
tangy
character
than
what
manisfested
in
the
taste
which
ended
up
being
more
piney
but
nevertheless
very
drinkable
and
abv
is
adequate
for
a
pale
ale
serving
type
bottle
o
this
is
a
nice
solid
pale
ale
that
is
enjoyable
throughout
the
year
easy
to
obtain
here
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
overall
i
prefer
the
dogfish
head
90
ipa
that
is
my
go
to
ipa
this
seems
still
to
have
too
much
bite
but
i
am
not
an
ipa
fan
generally
this
is
a
solid
middle
of
the
road
for
me
this
is
what
im
talking
about
highly
recommended
othis
was
the
first
beer
i
could
not
finish
when
i
started
getting
into
craft
beer
a
couple
years
ago
and
i
cant
believe
i
thought
this
beer
was
too
bitter
but
it
was
at
the
time
this
is
my
first
time
having
it
since
and
this
time
around
i
thought
it
a
had
a
very
strong
fruitiness
that
seemed
strange
for
the
style
my
least
favorite
of
the
great
lakes
yearround
offerings
o
really
quite
good
even
past
its
prime
this
is
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
you
can
get
goes
down
easy
and
still
has
a
nice
hop
character
d
4
5
i
could
enjoy
plenty
of
these
very
well
balanced
taste
and
smooth
it
isnt
heavy
great
session
brew
overall
a
solid
choice
if
you
see
it
good
subtle
flavors
that
are
interesting
sip
after
sip
you
could
drink
a
few
and
the
beer
would
still
seem
fresh
and
new
i
wish
the
flavors
were
stronger
but
it
is
just
a
pale
ale
so
i
understand
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
moderate
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aromas
of
toast
malt
and
grains
are
fresh
and
not
overpowering
there
are
broad
wellbalanced
and
bracing
citrus
hop
flavors
which
are
complemented
by
some
roasted
malt
on
the
midpalate
very
nice
and
drinkable
ale
it
would
be
easy
to
enjoy
several
of
these
without
it
being
taxing
or
overly
hoppy
d
drinkability
is
fair
i
wouldnt
go
with
more
than
two
at
a
time
but
thats
just
me
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
american
pale
ale
this
is
the
reason
i
think
american
beers
are
on
their
way
to
surpassing
the
british
style
pale
well
crafted
balance
of
malt
and
bitter
hops
a
great
bite
at
the
end
deep
reddish
color
and
a
creamy
head
with
good
retention
i
love
this
brewery
and
this
is
one
of
their
best
overall
a
perfectly
simple
and
tasty
apa
a
good
beer
to
frequent
during
the
summer
and
warmer
months
goes
well
will
lots
of
hearty
full
meals
this
very
drinkable
slightly
above
average
in
abv
with
a
cleansing
quality
to
the
palate
this
beer
can
keep
you
company
all
night
very
good
brew
worth
enjoying
best

mouthfeel
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
finished
full
yet
deliciously
bone
dry
bitterness
lingers
so
so
so
minimally
which
is
perfect
for
the
style
overall
this
and
deschutes
mirror
pond
are
the
best
2
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
from
great
lakes
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
bit
hoppier
than
your
average
pa
bujt
still
nice
balance
a
lingering
sweetness
finishes
nicely
good
job
of
balancing
the
components
here
drinkability
decent
amount
of
hops
in
this
pale
alemade
me
double
check
the
label
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
an
ipa
very
drinkable
well
balanced
brew
all
in
all
id
definetely
drink
it
again
but
it
is
not
as
tasty
as
some
of
the
other
beers
from
great
lakes
d
i
was
able
to
finish
it
but
the
residual
hop
presence
in
the
mouth
along
with
the
bitter
aftertaste
would
keep
me
from
ordering
another
one
this
would
probably
be
good
with
some
strong
dishes
heat
or
spice
i
laughed
as
it
almost
tasted
like
a
decadent
burning
river
this
is
my
second
beer
on
tap
from
obryckis
in
the
cleveland
oh
airport
and
this
one
is
also
lacking
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
good
however
hippy
floral
and
woody
notes
that
blend
well
together
gives
the
beer
a
very
nice
bitterness
that
doesnt
really
overpower
the
taste
buds
that
makes
this
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
simple
its
good
a
good
beer
but
in
the
end
i
have
to
compare
to
the
gold
standard
is
this
american
pale
as
good
as
snpa
not
quite
its
good
one
i
would
purchase
if
i
wads
in
the
region
but
nothing
i
would
go
above
and
beyond
for
d
nice
offering
approachable
yet
interesting
solid
brew
great
ipa
very
tasty
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
session
would
recommend
d
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
the
residual
bitterness
keeps
me
from
wanting
many
more
overall
not
a
very
impressive
pale
ale
d
very
sessionworthy
great
apa
to
me
not
overdone
in
terms
of
hops
very
sessionable
no
brainer
here
d
drank
my
glass
with
no
problem
a
nice
apa
but
ive
certainly
had
better
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
has
very
good
retention
good
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
floral
hops
sweet
malts
and
earth
tones
in
the
aroma
when
taking
a
sip
of
this
beer
i
get
some
floral
hops
at
first
followed
by
some
caramel
and
than
a
citrus
orange
taste
follows
there
also
seems
to
be
an
alcohol
and
yeast
taste
in
the
background
while
some
hops
are
in
the
forefront
of
the
taste
the
aftertaste
is
floral
hops
and
an
orange
citrus
taste
that
is
not
too
over
powering
this
is
a
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
pleasing
on
the
palate
and
even
though
im
pretty
new
to
this
style
ill
admit
it
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
tried
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweetskunky
malt
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
skunky
malt
wheat
and
sweet
malt
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
brew
but
it
also
wasnt
that
great
either
the
skunky
aspect
on
this
one
hurt
this
brew
overall
i
would
have
loved
for
it
to
have
a
little
hop
character
to
help
overcome
some
of
the
skunkiness
going
on
here
get
rid
of
the
skunk
aspect
and
i
would
be
willing
to
try
again
until
then
not
so
much
drinkabilty
a
fantastic
beer
smooth
mild
lower
alcohol
and
great
taste
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
you
can
buy
very
easy
to
drink
a
6pack
in
a
sitting
so
be
carefull
a
must
try
pale
ale
d
i
have
been
impressed
by
every
great
lakes
beer
i
ever
had
and
this
one
is
no
exception
full
of
hoppy
goodness
solid
malt
base
sweetening
the
deal
and
affordable
cost
cases
starting
at
a
mere
28
bucks
its
pretty
much
a
go
to
beer
a
world
class
pale
ale
d
great
drinkability
has
sessionable
potential
d
pretty
good
the
beer
itself
is
fairly
tasty
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
or
two
still
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
and
if
im
ever
in
an
area
that
sells
it
again
i
may
grab
another
sixer
many
beer
drinkers
when
they
first
move
beyond
terrible
adjunct
lagers
look
down
their
nose
on
pale
ales
and
lagers
because
they
feel
it
is
closer
to
what
they
now
detest
and
can
barely
stand
the
taste
of
industrial
plant
beer
and
espouse
a
preference
for
more
severely
malted
or
hopped
varieties
or
bigger
beers
but
great
beers
are
great
beers
plain
and
simple
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
beer
mug
strikingly
gorgeous
clear
orange
color
smallish
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
leaving
half
moon
lacing
it
has
a
citrusy
scent
that
mixes
with
grainy
hops
flavor
follows
the
smell
strong
hop
presence
not
the
easiest
to
drink
but
a
great
flavor
citrus
beginning
quickly
dominated
by
hop
bitterness
full
flavor
mouthfeel
how
a
beer
should
feel
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
good
brew
dm
slight
carbonation
tingle
very
smooth
on
the
pallet
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
pours
a
pretty
clear
orange
yellow
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
doesnt
go
away
quickly
and
a
ton
of
lacing
smells
of
piney
hops
and
a
little
citrus
tastes
of
hops
citrus
and
some
hidden
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
has
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
moderate
im
gonna
go
ahead
and
say
it
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
think
ive
gotten
a
bit
spoiled
living
in
cleveland
where
every
bar
even
the
lameass
ones
carries
this
on
tap
it
is
hoppy
as
hell
but
drinkability
is
still
totally
exceptional
the
rare
beer
thats
perfect
for
every
season
warming
enough
for
a
cold
winter
day
like
today
and
still
gets
the
job
done
in
the
middle
of
the
dog
days
of
summer
drinkability
this
would
make
for
an
unreal
session
beer
why
can
we
not
stock
this
at
the
lcbo
major
props
to
spinrsx
for
finding
this
beer
and
sharing
it
with
me
i
am
blessed
and
honoured
to
have
you
in
my
beer
life
like
i
said
this
is
hoppy
maybe
hoppier
than
alot
of
ipas
in
the
end
it
works
and
gl
doesnt
go
overboard
super
flavorful
easily
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
decent
taste
a
good
mix
of
hop
and
malt
as
indicated
by
the
smell
a
good
balance
of
flavors
good
mouthfeel
nice
crisp
flavor
with
good
carbonation
leaving
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
overall
another
fantastic
beer
by
glbc
not
necessarily
a
head
turner
but
a
superbly
crafted
brew
the
carbonation
id
upfront
on
the
tongue
it
builds
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
taste
starts
malty
pale
and
a
slight
butter
crystal
malt
finish
this
isnt
hard
to
drink
at
all
and
nothing
here
tastes
bad
but
i
stopped
to
pick
some
great
lakes
up
while
out
of
town
because
they
dont
distribute
where
i
live
and
i
was
expecting
a
hoppy
beer
here
the
other
stuff
i
got
from
them
namely
edmund
fitzgerald
was
great
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
what
its
billed
as
and
its
relatively
fresh
i
plan
on
heading
to
the
midwest
next
summer
where
i
will
likely
have
this
again
i
hope
my
opinion
changes
once
i
have
this
from
the
source
at
gl
would
have
another
as
a
matter
of
fact
excuse
me
while
i
indulge
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
color
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
abv
and
bestby
date
on
the
label
two
finger
head
which
dissipates
slowly
aroma
is
a
blend
of
hops
pine
citrus
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
taste
upfront
is
malty
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
solid
carbonation
with
very
nice
lacing
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
definitely
a
beer
for
any
occasion
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
highly
recommended
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
fresher
it
is
usually
a
little
hoppier
than
this
but
even
in
this
bottle
it
is
still
good
got
2
more
bottles
of
it
to
go
should
be
a
good
night
d
this
one
went
down
very
easily
once
again
im
impressed
with
great
lakes
they
just
seem
to
make
very
nicely
flavored
easydrinking
beers
put
this
one
up
there
with
snpa
and
anchors
liberty
ale
as
showcases
of
the
style
drinkability
is
just
flat
out
high
pours
a
clear
dulled
gold
color
with
moderate
cap
of
white
head
minimal
lacing
scent
is
a
balanced
mix
of
bready
lightly
roasted
malts
and
grassy
and
citrus
grapefruit
hops
taste
brings
the
same
balance
but
quite
bitter
notes
coming
from
the
grain
and
hops
somewhat
earthy
and
grassy
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
lingers
on
tongue
a
good
pale
ale
definitely
more
balanced
than
many
west
coast
style
apas
that
are
more
common
this
beer
tastes
so
good
its
hard
to
put
down
full
of
smoky
maltiness
and
balanced
by
exactly
the
right
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
its
an
awardwinning
brew
and
it
certainly
deserves
them
pale
ales
of
all
types
are
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
ever
tasted
and
flavor
is
the
name
of
the
game
d
light
and
easy
to
drink
sessionable
for
sure
i
have
definitely
sessioned
this
in
the
past
without
any
issues
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
delicious
malt
and
hop
characteristics
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
great
lakes
wouldnt
mind
having
another
burning
river
is
super
drinkable
and
well
made
i
just
keep
coming
back
to
the
world
clean
this
is
sort
of
like
a
pale
ale
that
was
brewed
to
be
like
a
easy
drinking
german
lager
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
a
great
one
to
enjoy
if
you
want
the
conversation
of
your
company
to
speak
louder
than
the
flavors
in
your
pale
ale
drink
just
a
fantastic
pale
ale
id
rank
this
one
up
there
with
sierra
nevada
it
is
extremely
sessionable
and
it
is
a
must
try
for
pale
ale
fans
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
bitter
in
the
finish
pours
pale
orange
topped
by
large
white
bubbly
head
smells
of
citrus
notes
slight
floral
and
lemon
zest
tastes
citrus
notes
floral
lemon
zest
some
rind
but
mostly
fruit
sweetness
without
the
bitter
hops
but
not
too
bitter
dry
finish
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
good
representation
of
the
apa
light
citrus
dry
tastes
is
imeadiatley
thick
of
hop
with
a
touch
of
bready
malt
and
a
nice
citrus
finish
laced
ncley
down
the
glass
as
i
went
along
poured
into
a
tulip
the
color
is
a
light
copper
with
a
white
head
decent
enough
retention
but
as
it
falls
theres
no
real
lacing
nose
brings
some
nice
citrus
and
grassy
hops
with
a
moderate
pale
malt
base
the
taste
really
focuses
in
on
some
grassy
hops
which
i
always
seem
to
get
from
great
lakes
hoppy
offerings
and
i
cant
say
that
im
really
a
fan
feel
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
bit
of
lightlysweet
malt
backing
drinks
well
in
the
end
but
the
flavor
just
isnt
quite
for
me
lots
of
malt
in
the
flavor
surprisingly
thick
bodied
faint
faint
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
sweet
too
starts
out
fairly
creamy
and
grows
very
rich
substantial
roast
barley
in
the
middle
beer
definitely
getting
better
as
it
warms
with
more
herbal
hops
coming
out
in
the
finish
pretty
nice
d
pretty
drinkable
brew
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
like
this
one
it
turned
out
i
did
got
this
one
in
the
great
lakes
sampler
i
recommend
trying
it
medium
body
that
has
a
clean
fresh
taste
and
is
nicely
balanced
drinkability
im
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
but
one
hits
the
spot
very
interesting
for
a
apa
this
is
not
your
average
pale
ale
its
orange
with
decent
lacing
but
the
nose
has
a
surprising
smokyearthy
note
along
with
the
apricot
hops
and
the
taste
picks
up
on
thatoaky
toasted
malt
bright
apricot
and
peach
taste
a
hoppy
but
sweet
end
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
all
add
up
to
one
drinkable
beer
i
loved
it
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
sheds
a
bitter
tear
d
what
a
bitter
brew
a
bouquet
of
hops
and
delicious
malt
great
brew
from
great
lakes
it
pours
an
golden
to
amber
color
that
is
completely
clear
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
on
top
the
smell
is
not
over
powering
but
give
hints
of
citrus
and
some
pineyness
from
the
first
sip
those
citrus
and
pine
flavors
kick
right
in
the
carbonation
adds
a
good
amount
of
fix
to
it
and
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
great
lakes
brewing
co
makes
some
amazing
beers
and
this
one
is
tied
with
eddie
fitz
for
my
favorite
right
now
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
thanks
to
tight
carbonation
this
beer
would
easily
cut
through
thick
cream
sauces
or
gravy
drinkability
is
good
d
good
goes
down
easily
not
the
best
pale
ale
ever
but
its
solid
and
drinkable
d
this
has
become
my
goto
pale
ale
in
the
last
several
weeks
and
a
favorite
among
my
almost
craftdrinking
friends
the
lack
of
bitterness
in
the
hops
and
the
malt
forwardness
make
this
a
crowd
favorite
md
all
of
the
flavors
match
well
together
with
none
seeming
to
overdue
the
others
which
lets
the
beer
shine
pretty
well
this
was
a
good
first
beer
from
great
lakes
cant
wait
to
get
into
the
rest
of
them
best
before
date
of
101010
which
i
will
take
into
account
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
nice
citrus
and
floral
hops
upfront
along
with
some
caramel
and
fruity
esters
biscuit
and
some
alcohol
not
outstanding
but
im
sure
it
was
more
impressive
when
it
was
fresher
the
flavor
also
has
floral
and
citric
hops
initially
along
with
some
caramel
and
biscuit
fruity
esters
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
really
good
pretty
damn
solid
pale
ale
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
a
fresher
example
but
it
was
good
nonetheless
deep
yellow
color
with
an
amber
hue
and
excellent
clarity
thin
white
head
that
reduces
to
a
similarly
thin
white
cap
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
citrus
notes
buttery
smooth
with
refreshing
lively
carbonation
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
along
with
a
bit
of
malty
flavored
goodness
in
there
as
well
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavor
until
the
end
when
the
pine
flavors
take
over
and
leave
a
dry
mild
bitter
pine
aftertaste
d
good
but
not
overly
impressive
glad
to
try
it
would
definitely
give
it
another
shot
end
beer
musings
though
my
rating
may
say
differently
i
did
enjoy
the
flavor
aspect
of
this
drink
the
most
important
when
not
scrutinizing
such
factors
such
as
appearance
and
aroma
you
will
find
this
to
be
a
good
pale
with
a
moderate
strong
hopping
per
style
and
worthy
of
a
try
and
to
put
down
in
repeats
notes
good
to
have
this
in
a
bottle
after
enjoying
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
so
long
ago
i
will
be
sure
to
find
a
fresh
one
and
report
back
here
with
any
changes
db
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
hop
forward
but
they
are
definitely
balanced
by
a
strong
malt
finish
and
backbone
not
too
much
of
anything
balanced
and
refreshing
this
is
a
beer
ive
had
many
times
and
have
always
found
it
highly
drinkable
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
regularlyoffered
beers
i
highly
recommend
it
d
very
drinkable
nothing
offensive
well
balanced
tasty
cant
ask
for
much
more
without
a
doubt
this
beer
displays
its
american
pale
ale
traits
its
balanced
yet
with
the
hops
always
up
front
surpassing
the
benchmark
is
our
conclusion
proof
that
a
midamerican
brewery
can
well
hop
a
pale
ale
like
the
rest
of
them
good
use
of
cascade
hops
i
gave
this
a
pretty
hard
pour
because
last
time
i
had
it
was
from
draft
and
im
curious
what
itll
do
a
heavy
pour
into
the
center
of
the
glass
gives
a
big
3
of
frothy
bubbly
beige
head
that
lingers
pretty
well
the
head
leaves
a
bunch
of
spotty
chunky
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
some
soft
orangey
citrus
hop
and
milky
smoothness
like
a
semibitter
orange
creamcicle
taste
is
mild
and
subdued
much
like
the
nose
but
dialed
back
a
few
big
notches
plus
a
little
diacetyl
and
maybe
vanilla
orange
creamcicle
indeed
a
little
sharp
pine
hop
also
tries
to
fight
through
and
although
it
is
very
minor
it
stands
out
quite
easily
and
i
wonder
if
the
beer
would
be
better
off
without
it
mouthfeel
is
even
and
smooth
smooth
and
appropriate
carbonation
finish
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
dry
on
the
tongue
tasty
drinkability
very
drinkable
strong
flavor
of
hops
but
well
balanced
with
malt
with
nothing
being
too
intense
or
intrusive
at
6
with
good
flavor
while
not
being
too
intense
it
makes
it
very
east
to
drink
a
few
however
it
may
be
too
bitter
and
strong
tasting
for
some
as
compared
to
the
lighter
or
milder
tasting
pale
ales
o
this
one
will
please
the
masses
but
doesnt
really
stick
out
in
my
mind
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
a
good
beer
that
drinks
easily
d
good
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
goes
down
easy
and
represents
the
style
well
puts
a
lot
of
other
pale
ales
ive
had
to
shame
as
far
as
apas
are
concerned
id
rate
this
high
for
drinkability
the
balance
is
there
the
hops
arent
overbearing
and
its
easy
drinking
d
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
if
i
were
to
guess
id
say
this
was
about
4
but
it
is
6
pretty
good
apa
overall
and
another
solid
beer
from
glbc
well
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
d
a
solid
to
great
pale
ale
a
good
refresher
with
a
solid
balance
and
taste
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
from
great
lakes
d
good
hot
day
sipping
beer
but
a
bit
light
on
the
flavor
for
my
tastes
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
taste
is
also
of
hops
lightly
malted
a
good
balance
slightly
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
type
it
will
be
one
of
my
goto
brews
it
is
very
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
this
is
in
my
top
5
favorite
apas
this
beer
is
very
balanced
and
tame
with
not
too
much
hop
domination
not
that
it
would
necessarily
be
a
bad
thing
some
pale
ales
are
borderline
ipas
but
burning
river
finds
a
good
balance
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
satisfying
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
picked
this
up
at
a
great
beer
store
saveon
tobacco
beverage
in
mentor
ohio
clear
orangeyellow
pour
with
a
nice
head
and
decent
lacing
very
odd
nose
for
a
pale
ale
kind
of
earthy
and
salty
with
none
of
the
typical
perfumy
floral
pale
smell
i
love
really
had
to
strain
to
get
anything
remotely
hoppy
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
smell
lots
of
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
great
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
if
you
can
get
past
the
nose
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
the
color
was
a
clear
amber
with
very
little
foam
there
was
a
mild
hops
aroma
with
no
malt
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
of
rich
malt
but
not
too
sweet
and
a
bitter
finish
mildly
spicy
and
floral
there
was
nothing
special
in
terms
of
mouth
feel
a
typical
pale
ale
very
drinkable
another
great
offering
from
a
great
brewery
that
just
came
to
the
twin
cities
market
this
pale
is
toasty
and
rich
slightly
honeysweet
the
hops
appropriate
and
harmonious
with
the
big
hit
of
hops
at
the
tail
end
of
this
treat
clean
copper
color
nice
white
head
great
lakes
really
has
a
handle
on
every
style
i
have
tried
from
them
thanks
for
remembering
that
we
are
on
the
great
lakes
great
lakes
brewing
company
d
this
is
a
drinkable
but
pretty
standard
ipa
it
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
though
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
that
is
probably
the
most
important
factor
for
a
beer
like
this
d
this
is
a
serious
ale
and
could
be
great
with
food
too
o
its
not
bad
by
any
means
it
just
doesnt
seem
remarkable
in
any
way
to
me
for
the
most
part
its
possible
that
i
got
an
old
bottle
since
there
was
no
date
enjoy
t
so
enough
of
my
bs
for
anybody
reading
this
who
is
considering
buying
some
do
it
you
cant
go
wrong
its
a
beautiful
tastey
brew
get
a
12
or
a
case
off
to
my
yard
work
and
another
burning
river
reach
for
a
river
oh
that
was
the
crooked
river
folks
but
they
are
gone
now
d
its
alright
but
for
the
low
abv
the
12
oz
was
not
the
easiest
thing
to
finish
and
i
dont
really
want
another
one
d
easy
drinker
real
smooth
would
drink
again
but
wont
seek
out
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
spicy
salty
and
slightly
hoppy
undertone
it
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
flavor
is
malty
and
crisp
with
fruity
and
hoppy
tones
and
just
a
hint
of
herbs
texture
is
silky
smooth
yet
leaves
a
nice
tingle
behind
this
is
one
easy
drinkin
brew
nothing
jumps
out
and
wows
you
flavor
or
complexity
wise
but
overall
a
very
nice
offering
good
overall
nitpicking
id
want
the
sweetness
to
be
a
little
more
subdued
the
hops
more
pronounced
the
abv
a
little
lower
but
thats
nitpicking
still
very
smooth
tasty
drinkable
a
great
example
of
a
pale
though
i
might
classify
it
more
as
the
english
style
rather
than
apa
i
havent
been
too
into
pale
ales
lately
so
its
good
to
have
one
that
reminds
me
of
the
potential
i
pair
it
with
some
pasta
with
a
marinara
sauce
nice
match
drinkability
very
good
pale
ale
its
not
my
favorite
but
it
could
definitely
be
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
d
a
wonderfully
well
balanced
pale
ale
that
should
be
enjoyed
sip
by
sip
overall
probably
the
best
gateway
great
lakes
d
a
great
example
for
the
style
and
one
that
i
love
very
aromatic
with
great
flavor
pours
a
mildly
clouds
lighter
orange
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
nice
pine
and
resin
with
some
sugary
sweetness
quite
pleasant
taste
is
pine
up
from
second
act
is
the
sweeter
candy
malts
and
the
finish
is
mild
bitter
hops
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
not
noteable
i
want
more
a
very
good
beer
that
i
wish
was
distributed
in
fl
d
a
very
good
pale
ale
not
a
single
complaint
about
this
one
another
great
gl
beer
back
during
my
boilermaker
years
my
boyz
and
i
believed
that
if
the
wabash
ever
had
a
cigarette
thrown
it
it
would
explode
into
an
inferno
that
would
make
lucifer
consider
relocating
this
has
no
real
importance
but
this
beer
tends
to
bring
that
memory
bubbling
to
the
surface
seriously
dont
swim
in
the
wabash
it
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
tall
bit
of
thick
light
ecru
froth
which
leaves
some
decent
lacing
behind
as
it
subsides
the
nose
is
pretty
unspectacular
with
notes
of
caramel
maple
syrup
and
a
light
touch
of
hops
not
citrus
not
floral
just
hops
in
general
the
taste
comprises
a
slight
bit
o
citrus
some
bitterness
and
a
solidly
bready
caramel
backbone
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
not
bad
though
i
wish
the
smell
were
a
little
better
this
could
pass
for
some
brewerys
ipa
the
color
has
something
to
do
with
that
could
see
3
of
these
being
the
proper
dosage
in
one
sitting
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
enough
to
have
around
medium
to
light
body
goes
down
very
easy
and
smooth
really
good
drinkability
great
session
beer
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
out
there
d
nicely
balanced
beer
with
enough
hop
kick
that
makes
this
a
great
alternative
to
an
i
p
a
buy
again
no
relatively
clean
mouthfeel
except
for
that
slight
chalkiness
in
the
finish
typical
of
an
overhopped
brew
carbonation
felt
just
right
as
a
fan
of
big
and
bold
flavors
i
usually
dont
pick
up
many
pale
ales
but
this
one
was
a
nice
surprise
recommended
d
very
drinkable
the
6
is
nicely
situated
in
this
one
almost
big
enough
to
be
an
ipa
but
drinkable
enough
to
be
a
daily
pale
ale
nice
balance
refreshing
clean
bitter
and
hoppy
fantastic
beer
d
good
apa
smooth
and
drinkable
representative
of
the
style
the
taste
also
features
oranges
and
grapefruit
there
is
also
a
caramel
malt
backbone
which
i
did
not
initially
pick
up
from
the
aroma
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
will
seek
this
out
again
tasty
and
hard
to
sip
id
drink
this
anytime
and
often
with
food
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
it
in
the
future
great

a
couple
fingers
of

over

a
steady
stream
of

bring
up

rind
citrusy

off

mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
long

aftertaste
pretty
typical
american
pale
ale
here
just
about
every
brewery
makes
one
and
honestly
you
oughta
be
drinking
the
one
your
local
makes
its
fresher
that
way
if
i
lived
in
cleveland
id
definitely
be
rockin
with
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
plenty
of
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
the
caramel
aroma
of
the
malt
starts
to
make
an
appearance
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
too
one
dimensional
to
warrant
a
higher
score
as
it
is
it
features
the
hops
but
lacks
suitable
malt
balance
a
good
body
for
a
hoppy
pale
ale
nice
carbonation
and
texture
a
good
hoppy
drinker
a
little
more
malt
would
be
nice
a
good
pale
ale
that
is
not
sessionable
due
to
the
high
hop
bitterness
sure
to
satisfy
a
hop
craving
but
in
my
opinion
needs
more
of
a
malt
backbone
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
when
youre
judging
it
to
style
it
seems
to
big
its
a
very
sweet
beer
that
they
pack
a
bunch
of
ibus
into
in
order
to
balance
it
out
it
definitely
has
balance
but
the
final
impression
is
that
its
very
bitter
for
a
pale
ale
but
thats
only
according
to
style
i
still
like
it
drinkability
is
good
a
pretty
easy
drinking
pale
ale
maybe
even
a
good
for
a
session
beer
ive
had
more
flavorful
brews
from
the
style
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
solid
example
certainly
worth
a
try
d
a
decent
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
just
a
bit
forgettable
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
by
any
means
it
will
just
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
liked
beer
2
of
the
3
great
lakes
that
i
purchased
burning
river
is
a
solid
pale
ale
nice
blend
of
malty
and
hoppy
just
like
an
apa
should
be
d
this
beer
is
excellent
wow
im
impressed
with
the
balance
of
this
apa
most
apas
i
think
border
the
ipa
category
a
little
too
much
but
this
one
is
nice
and
balanced
with
a
light
hop
character
that
lets
the
malts
do
its
own
thing
really
nice
ill
be
buying
more
drinkability
pretty
solid
example
of
the
apa
style
worth
having
but
i
prefer
others
especially
ones
with
a
drier
finish
all
in
all
i
could
easily
see
going
through
a
six
pack
of
this
in
a
day
which
says
its
better
than
most
pale
ales
d
even
at
6
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
any
style
i
have
had
could
it
be
a
new
everyday
sipper
perhaps
exceptional
stuff
d
though
not
technically
a
session
beer
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
flavor
that
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
a
few
back
in
a
sitting
im
not
overly
impressed
by
this
one
flavor
is
there
though
color
and
appearance
are
good
i
think
it
stems
to
aroma
and
innability
to
taste
much
without
the
help
of
aroma
still
a
good
contender
for
the
style
follows
it
well
straightforward
no
nuances
or
unique
aspect
throughout
the
bottle
a
good
price
for
a
good
almost
if
not
great
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
ring
with
loads
of
lacing
on
side
of
glass
the
smell
has
nice
citrus
and
grass
and
a
great
hop
aroma
i
smell
malt
and
bread
too
the
taste
is
great
big
citrus
taste
with
other
fruits
its
crisp
with
pine
and
hops
then
its
all
smoothed
out
in
the
end
with
tasty
malt
this
is
one
solid
pale
ale
it
has
great
hopscitrus
and
malt
with
a
nice
medium
mouth
feel
it
is
highly
drinkable
a
solidtop
apa
notes
this
has
become
my
favorite
beer
it
is
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
which
is
out
of
cleveland
ohio
i
live
in
toledo
ohio
so
great
lakes
beers
are
abundant
they
have
yet
to
dissapoint
me
any
that
cant
get
to
them
let
me
know
and
i
can
help
you
out
d
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
plenty
of
better
apas
out
there
another
winner
from
great
lakes
nuff
said
this
is
an
excellent
american
pale
aleif
you
havent
had
anything
from
great
lakes
let
me
tell
you
you
are
missimg
outthey
put
out
great
stuffit
pours
a
brownishdark
rednice
head

smells
almost
like
an
ipa
taste
is
some
bitternesshoppyand
drinks
incredibly
wellit
is
even
better
on
tap
careful
cause
this
one
may
make
you
want
to
drink
them
all
night
it
has
a
beautiful
floral
bitter
taste
very
hoppy
crisp
theres
a
vegetable
taste
to
it
this
is
about
as
perfect
a
pale
ale
as
ive
had
love
it
im
usually
an
avid
ipa
guy
but
this
one
impressed
me
this
brew
is
far
better
than
great
lakes
ipa
pours
nice
hoppy
nose
great
head
and
all
that
good
stuff
a
fantastic
hoppy
brew
without
the
slamming
bitterness
flowery
aromatic
without
being
sweet
not
one
bit
of
sweet
this
is
one
really
great
brew
right
there
with
the
best
pas
on
the
market
and
nicely
drinkable
d
very
good
beer
will
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
when
im
in
the
area
the
brewery
itself
is
very
impressive
very
environmentally
conscience
gorgeous
building
on
a
brick
street
in
downtown
cleveland
food
much
better
than
average
in
a
200
year
old
building
that
elliot
ness
got
shot
in
thats
what
you
get
for
trying
to
stop
me
from
my
daily
intake
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
usually
like
hoppier
pale
ales
but
this
was
incredibly
balanced
and
full
flavored
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
of
these
another
excellent
brew
from
great
lakes
d
still
drinking
good
even
if
past
the
date
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
fades
slowly
with
nice
lacing
smells
nicely
of
citrus
and
flowery
hops
and
a
faint
background
metallic
note
nice
body
up
front
with
lots
of
sharp
bitterness
the
body
thins
out
towards
the
end
and
the
bitterness
becomes
more
pronounced
with
a
mild
metallic
taste
the
finish
is
slightly
harsh
and
lingering
drinkability
is
good
despite
the
slightly
unbalanced
hop
profile
this
beer
has
a
westcoast
style
vibe
going
on
to
me
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
like
it
tastecitrus
notesbitter
hops
and
a
biscuity
malt
backbone
that
provides
a
nice
balance
hoppy
edge
with
a
fruity
biscuit
quality
that
makes
for
a
tasty
refreshing
pale
ale
very
nice
and
full
of
character
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
does
not
stand
out
as
some
of
the
other
ipas
very
good
drinkability
ive
long
been
a
fan
of
burning
river
one
bad
thing
about
being
comfortably
within
the
great
lakes
distribution
area
is
that
i
often
take
their
beers
for
granted
pass
them
up
in
favor
of
something
shinier
so
to
speak
in
any
case
this
is
very
good
beer
recommended
carbonation
is
a
little
low
which
i
like
here
dry
finish
makes
each
sip
as
good
as
the
last
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
left
pours
a
mix
of
light
amber
straw
gold
with
a
minimal
egg
shell
head
lots
of
good
lacing
though
the
bottom
third
of
my
glass
is
one
nice
snowy
sheet
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
malt
sweetness
there
are
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
with
a
little
earthiness
too
the
hops
become
more
apparent
in
the
taste
nice
citrus
tropical
fruit
with
a
touch
of
woodsy
bitterness
bready
and
sweet
malts
are
there
mouthfeel
is
light
to
mediumbodied
and
carbonation
is
fairly
high
but
not
overly
zingy
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
think
this
may
become
one
of
my
goto
pale
ales
too
bad
i
have
to
drive
about
3
hours
to
get
some
great
stuff
nice
session
beer
tasty
and
easy
drinking
d
ive
had
this
before
and
cant
say
the
age
has
been
bad
to
it
but
i
will
say
id
love
to
give
a
fresh
bottle
a
review
not
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
not
a
favorite
great
lakes
for
that
matter
f
semi
bitter
it
gets
a
little
more
bitter
on
the
finish
also
pretty
dry
the
lingering
grassy
and
earthy
hop
flavors
seem
to
really
come
out
at
the
end
when
the
other
flavors
are
gone
more
of
that
bitter
english
real
ale
character
but
lighter
on
the
ale
and
spicier
on
the
hop
a
nice
light
pale
ale
overall
drinkable
has
a
nice
hop
character
a
solid
apa
i
could
see
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
get
them
around
here
if
i
could
complain
about
anything
it
would
be
the
slight
yeasty
aroma
and
flavor
all
in
all
this
is
a
hoppy
grapefruit
bitterness
type
brew
not
for
me
if
you
like
hops
and
dry
flavor
then
try
this
one
otherwise
not
worth
your
time
a
great
example
of
the
style
another
solid
great
lakes
brew
drinkability
is
fantastic
not
so
hoppy
you
want
to
stop
but
enough
flavor
and
aftertaste
to
make
drinking
an
enticing
and
interesting
brew
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
may
not
be
a
hopped
up
brew
for
hop
heads
but
there
is
enough
there
to
keep
a
hop
head
happy
this
brew
is
very
sessionable
and
is
more
approachable
for
some
non
hop
heads
a
good
party
brew
or
any
time
for
that
matter
very
good
the
thing
i
like
most
about
burning
river
is
the
fact
that
it
knows
what
it
is
it
excels
at
it
and
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
else
this
is
one
helluva
pale
ale
and
i
might
make
this
a
goto
from
a
bottle
this
pours
with
little
head
but
a
fragrant
aroma
light
amber
color
hops
citrus
and
pine
maybe
from
the
cascadian
hops
are
the
dominate
flavors
in
that
order
it
also
doesnt
seem
to
impart
the
dry
mouth
feel
that
many
pale
ales
do
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
notes
second
brew
i
have
from
great
lakes
as
they
reach
the
dc
area
and
sure
enough
their
brews
are
good
quality
so
far
this
pale
ale
can
be
had
with
the
best
of
them
in
the
style
glad
to
include
in
the
rotating
selection
of
pas
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
one
that
is
always
iconic
and
important
to
have
around
to
offer
as
a
quality
and
quaffable
entry
point
to
craft
brews
and
a
reliable
option
to
have
have
in
any
case
burning
river
sure
is
great
on
that
front
d
6
abv
for
an
apa
is
reasonable
i
think
it
only
takes
one
to
appreciate
this
fine
work
though
so
much
going
on
here
one
hell
of
a
brew
dthe
nose
was
awesome
the
taste
fell
a
little
short
of
that
but
still
extremely
good
pale
ale
i
really
enjoy
great
lakes
and
this
is
definitely
a
solid
offering
for
the
style
a
beautiful
clear
copper
color
with
lively
carbonation
a
decent
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
suggests
lots
of
deep
grainy
malt
and
pleasing
piney
hops
really
edible
smelling
very
nice
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
in
sync
with
the
aroma
a
nice
midbodied
brew
with
fair
woodsy
pine
hop
over
biscuit
and
bready
malt
sweet
grass
and
mellow
pine
almost
a
seaweed
quality
but
very
nice
highly
drinkable
very
nice
for
some
hops
and
tasty
refreshment
overall
i
was
expecting
alil
more
on
the
hop
end
from
this
beer
but
not
to
bad
a
great
pale
ale
to
get
people
into
the
pale
category
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
an
alternative
to
the
sometimes
boring
ipas
that
seem
to
creep
their
way
into
my
sessions
far
too
often
at
6
abv
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
a
great
session
beer
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
another
quality
beer
from
great
lakes
this
pale
ale
is
real
hoppy
but
crisp
and
drinkable
as
well
had
this
beer
at
some
beer
bar
in
downtown
columbus
ohio
this
beer
is
amber
coloured
and
it
is
hoppy
as
hell
with
some
biscuity
malts
balancing
it
out
in
fact
i
think
it
may
borderline
on
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
sixpack
but
id
like
this
when
im
in
the
mood
for
an
ipaapa
hybrid
d
clean
crisp
sharp
easy
on
the
palate
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
one
of
my
go
to
beers
for
sure
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
just
wish
they
had
east
coast
distribution
d
tasty
malt
background
pairs
well
with
the
fruityherbal
hops
easy
drinking
with
enough
complexity
to
leave
me
wanting
a
refill
enjoyed
with
a
spicy
texas
chili
the
paring
was
great
the
hops
cut
through
the
spice
in
the
chili
like
a
hot
knife
through
butter
thanks
mark
got
this
in
a
trade
from
intimidtor
thanks
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
smells
hoppy
as
i
pour
it
this
is
a
good
sign
looks
great
in
the
glass
coppery
orange
in
color
this
is
probably
the
clearest
pale
ale
i
have
ever
seen
small
abundant
bubbles
make
an
inch
of
white
head
that
dissipates
leaving
no
noticeable
lacing
tastes
of
bittering
hops
dry
and
spicy
faint
citrus
but
mostly
clean
dry
bitterness
feel
is
good
if
a
bit
thin
excellent
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
i
find
it
very
refreshing
and
the
6
abv
means
i
could
enjoy
a
bunch
of
them
without
ending
up
face
down
on
the
floor
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
i
would
have
it
on
a
regular
basis
would
drink
again
mild
hop
flavor
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
back
high
malt
character
and
a
slight
aftertaste
nothing
too
bad
this
is
an
ok
apa
not
great
just
ok
d
nice
and
balanced
apa
here
nothing
mindblowing
just
a
good
goto
option
even
at
6
this
isnt
completely
out
of
the
question
as
a
session
brew
drinkability
supremely
easy
to
drink
but
just
missed
the
perfect
rating
because
of
the
burnt
flavour
while
interesting
doesnt
quite
lend
itself
to
great
drinkability
d
quite
quaffable
solid
and
enjoyable
i
would
gladly
drink
again
not
my
favorite
great
lakes
offering
but
still
a
very
good
one
pours
light
orange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
possibly
vienna
malt
you
also
get
some
piney
hops
the
flavor
is
piney
hops
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
backbone
not
too
complex
but
a
good
apa
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
straightforward
but
really
good
assertively
bitter
pale
ale
this
is
simply
an
excellent
beer
another
score
from
great
lakes
easily
drinkable
and
easily
sessionable
solid
fingers
worth
of
creamy
white
foam
a
few
islands
of
very
large
bubbles
average
stickiness
to
the
lacing
moderate
retention
clear
amber
brown
with
a
swift
lightening
into
orange
hues
close
to
yellow
at
the
outer
rims
squeaky
clean
and
transparent
open
and
gregarious
nose
of
mandarin
orange
toffee
brownies
and
a
counterbalance
of
rye
grains
and
witch
hazel
suggestion
of
yellow
apple
apricot
peach
fruit
not
crafted
for
complexity
rather
for
consistent
harmony
mediumbodied
solid
and
barrelchested
moves
with
deliberation
through
the
mouth
fairly
active
carbonation
however
doesnt
break
up
much
of
the
density
much
hoppier
here
with
grassy
notes
grapefruit
along
with
the
orange
zest
grainy
even
in
texture
the
cocoa
mocha
powder
back
into
the
chorus
more
regular
white
bread
here
than
rye
the
apricot
peach
apple
fruit
more
pronounced
touch
more
bitter
at
the
end
but
surely
intended
leaves
you
thirsty
for
more
d
this
beer
has
balanced
written
all
over
it
i
have
seen
in
on
tons
of
best
of
lists
especially
by
cooks
and
foodies
and
now
i
know
why
this
beer
can
pair
with
anything
hopefully
ny
will
see
more
great
lakes
many
beer
drinkers
do
not
enjoy
the
highly
hopped
ipas
and
dipa
this
beer
strikes
a
good
balance
between
styles
this
is
something
all
should
strive
for
d
this
is
a
drinkable
apa
for
sure
my
only
problem
is
i
dont
think
it
is
as
good
as
everyone
makes
it
out
to
be
there
are
many
other
apas
that
i
would
rather
drink
i
would
recommend
this
though
to
someone
who
wants
to
try
to
step
into
the
world
of
hops
close
to
perfect
drinkability
more
please
d
well
balanced
very
tasty
and
goes
down
easily
i
really
wish
this
brewery
distributed
this
way
as
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
d
this
was
a
solid
pale
ale
i
could
not
wrap
my
head
around
the
apple
taste
but
it
really
added
a
little
extra
to
the
beer
this
one
is
pretty
sessionable
thoughts
another
solid
beer
from
the
men
and
women
at
great
lakes
they
are
a
solid
brewery
with
great
pricing
this
is
a
very
nicely
put
together
pale
ale
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
simply
for
the
taste
of
it
it
has
a
great
appearance
smell
mouthfeel
and
is
very
is
to
drink
but
it
all
comes
down
to
the
taste
i
havent
tried
a
beer
from
here
that
wasnt
of
good
quality
i
have
had
a
beer
or
two
that
wasnt
suited
to
my
taste
but
that
was
a
style
differenc
not
a
production
flaw
impression
good
brew
will
get
this
again
a
good
beer
something
that
is
good
to
sit
down
drink
relax
and
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
i
like
my
pales
a
bit
hoppier
but
this
is
still
damn
nice
and
almost
perfectly
balanced
aroma
shows
notes
of
some
nice
citrus
from
the
cascade
hops
and
a
sweet
fruitiness
from
the
malts
taste
is
hoppy
with
some
sweet
fruity
flavors
that
are
very
good
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
d
havent
had
all
that
many
pale
ales
of
late
but
this
one
ranked
among
the
best
for
enjoyability
a
big
flavor
profile
and
wonderful
balance
intriguing
aroma
and
beauty
to
the
eye
none
garnered
a
score
better
than
a
4
from
me
but
all
were
close
enough
to
more
such
that
the
whole
does
equal
more
than
the
individual
parts
a
very
nice
highlyrecommendable
ale
overall
very
easy
drinking
a
sessionable
beer
for
sure
not
too
thin
of
a
mouthfeel
like
some
pale
ales
suffer
from
this
is
substantial
and
still
has
great
drinkability
i
would
definitely
love
to
session
this
if
it
were
my
local
i
havent
had
a
great
lakes
that
i
dont
like
yet
simple
but
fundamentally
good
many
other
bottles
of
this
that
ive
consumed
did
not
have
the
touch
of
funk
that
i
experienced
here
sessionable
overall
impression
top
notch
lively
and
enjoyable
apa
would
love
to
have
access
to
this
all
the
time
d
exactly
what
i
expect
from
an
apa
easy
to
drink
lots
of
flavor
good
session
beer
if
you
can
find
this
pretty
easy
to
do
try
it
out
drinkability
is
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
pale
ale
nothing
thats
too
special
but
not
bad
overall
another
quality
beer
from
great
lakes
this
pale
ale
is
real
hoppy
but
crisp
and
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
you
can
sit
and
drink
and
really
enjoy
in
an
evening
great
stuff
d
not
as
bitter
as
some
pale
ales
absences
of
such
highlights
the
caramel
aftertaste
which
gives
the
beer
that
unfermented
sugary
feel
that
is
very
delicious
light
gold
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
pine
taste
is
grapefruitpine
and
hops
this
is
just
another
one
of
those
beers
that
have
pinesol
written
all
over
it
i
was
always
under
the
impression
that
pine
was
a
scent
not
a
flavor
this
is
not
good
to
drink
but
im
sure
it
does
a
hell
of
a
job
cleaning
floors
great
example
of
the
apa
style
d
this
is
a
very
good
easy
to
drink
pale
it
reminds
me
of
pine
belt
pale
ale
from
southern
star
worth
trying
sometime
if
you
can
get
it
d
a
nice
apa
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
great
lakes
i
found
it
to
be
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
it
certainly
holds
its
own
against
some
of
the
best
in
the
category
drinkability
very
good
you
can
drink
this
all
night
great
lakes
have
yet
to
let
me
down
and
this
streak
continues
in
fact
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
they
may
well
be
my
favourite
brewery
at
this
moment
in
time
to
be
so
consistently
excellent
over
such
a
diverse
array
of
styles
is
simply
staggering
burning
river
pale
ale
is
probably
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
this
category
its
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
and
this
is
the
sort
of
brew
that
id
love
to
have
a
permanent
supply
of
should
i
ever
have
the
fortune
to
be
stranded
on
a
desert
island
and
not
be
stuck
in
cold
and
snowy
toronto
thanks
to
kels
for
this
freebie
drinkability
another
great
session
ale
from
great
lakes
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
well
balanced
if
anyone
is
looking
for
a
tasty
easily
quaffed
and
highly
rewarding
pale
ale
then
i
might
just
point
them
in
the
direction
of
cleveland
ohio
there
are
pale
ales
out
there
just
as
good
even
better
but
there
arent
many
breweries
who
turn
up
as
high
a
number
of
quality
beers
as
great
lakes
they
either
make
good
beer
or
they
make
great
beer
d
superbly
sessionable
pale
ale
that
i
come
back
to
time
after
time
d
quite
good
interesting
enough
to
warrant
extended
sipping
and
light
enough
to
make
that
possible
overall
im
very
glad
i
decided
to
grab
this
beer
from
the
local
kroger
here
in
the
cincinnati
area
ive
heard
some
good
things
about
the
great
lakes
brewing
company
and
this
certainly
didnt
disappoint
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
apa
and
should
be
on
everyones
list
if
you
havnt
tried
it
drinkability
is
high
its
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
this
is
what
pale
ale
should
taste
like
a
tasty
hophead
brew
smells
fantastic
notes
great
lakes
continues
to
impress
me
with
each
beer
i
drink
while
not
as
good
as
eliot
ness
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
tasty
hoppy
brew
definitely
a
good
example
not
the
best
but
still
quite
drinkable
worth
a
shot
d
interesting
beer
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nice
apa
not
overly
hoppy
but
quite
flavorful
and
balanced
not
the
best
apa
ive
ever
had
but
a
really
good
one
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
and
would
happily
have
another
a
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
possibly
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
ill
have
to
try
this
again
for
sure
this
is
the
american
pale
ale
that
is
my
measuring
stick
for
all
other
beers
of
this
style
the
pour
is
a
copper
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
always
sticks
to
the
glass
big
floral
hops
with
some
pine
and
hints
of
vanilla
and
grapefruit
for
me
hops
are
boss
when
it
comes
to
taste
not
overpowering
like
a
dipa
or
even
an
ipa
but
this
is
the
focal
point
you
get
some
caramel
breadiness
mixed
in
but
this
has
a
great
dry
finish
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
but
in
my
opinion
its
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
its
thick
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
lightly
bitter
aftertate
good
drinkability
pours
gold
with
a
moderate
downy
head
and
no
veil
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
classic
cascade
floral
and
pine
with
just
a
hint
of
light
vanilla
underneath
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
with
lively
carbonation
the
taste
is
very
hop
forward
for
the
style
venturing
toward
if
not
crossing
the
border
between
apa
and
ipa
the
floral
and
pine
flavors
take
the
lead
and
fade
while
the
strong
bitter
flavors
come
to
the
fore
the
malt
backbone
suggested
by
the
vanilla
smell
makes
only
a
cameo
appearance
a
very
nice
apa
but
given
the
lack
of
balance
only
hop
lovers
need
apply
drinkablity
is
high
with
only
6
abv
lightly
hoppy
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
you
can
easily
enjoy
one
or
five
of
these
in
a
night
3
5
d
this
is
the
first
gl
brew
that
didnt
floor
me
its
a
quality
beer
and
would
never
be
pissed
about
drinking
it
but
there
are
so
many
better
apas
out
there
that
ill
give
this
one
a
pass
most
of
the
time
one
of
my
favorite
by
gl
drinkable
very
sessionable
definately
sure
does
go
down
easy
hard
to
have
just
one
pours
a
clear
deep
copperamber
color
with
a
bubbly
beige
head
that
impales
itself
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smells
of
citrus
light
sweet
fruit
slight
mineral
taste
is
smooth
citrus
with
a
fruity
burnt
sugar
malt
sweetness
great
balance
twinge
of
hops
bit
of
malt
leaves
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
of
every
sip
crisp
carbonation
sticky
resinous
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
semi
dry
finish
great
session
ale
here
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
finger
of
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
weak
mainly
caramel
malt
and
straw
taste
is
slightly
better
although
that
just
brings
it
up
to
average
overall
i
dont
think
this
beer
really
has
anything
going
for
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
and
the
malt
profile
is
nothing
special
to
make
up
for
it
d
overall
not
a
bad
pale
ale
at
all
very
refreshing
nice
full
flavor
thats
not
overpowering
and
sessionable
abv
d
i
dont
know
this
beer
threw
me
off
i
had
certain
expectations
i
guess
i
did
enjoy
it
i
actually
cracked
open
another
one
as
soon
as
i
finished
the
first
but
its
not
what
id
reach
for
when
i
want
a
hoppy
pale
ale
a
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
under
2
freshest
by
92109
poured
into
my
imperial
nonic
pint
glass
the
pale
ale
appears
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
citrus
mainly
grapefruit
with
hints
of
orange
peel
a
good
amount
of
caramelized
malts
medium
toasted
bready
grains
slightly
perfumy
and
floral
hops
wonderful
balance
overall
the
ale
is
just
about
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
with
a
bittersweet
crisp
finish
a
great
everyday
pale
ale
glad
that
they
finally
made
it
to
eastern
pa
d
easy
to
session
a
nice
pale
ale
indeed
could
of
had
a
tad
bit
more
in
the
way
of
body
d
a
solid
brew
to
be
sure
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
considering
my
usual
high
expectations
for
gl
unfortunately
this
beer
committed
the
great
beer
sin
in
my
eyes
lack
of
balance
way
more
hops
than
the
malt
can
support
this
is
a
pretty
classic
style
pale
ale
i
can
see
how
it
would
definitely
be
a
staple
brew
in
its
home
area
good
offering
from
gl
but
not
one
to
go
too
far
out
of
your
way
to
obtain
overall
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
is
quite
sessionable
a
relatively
mild
beer
that
maintains
both
complexity
and
flavor
pours
amber
with
a
respectable
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
citrusy
but
not
strong
the
taste
too
is
mild
citrus
sweet
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
only
average
with
a
little
carbonation
very
drinkable
because
it
is
fairly
mild
overall
there
are
too
many
slight
mild
light
average
used
to
describe
burning
river
it
is
what
it
is
an
average
bland
apa
light
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
pours
a
light
peach
color
with
an
initial
three
fingers
of
head
that
fades
slowly
scent
is
mostly
hops
earthy
floral
and
citrusy
wow
what
a
delicious
pale
ale
where
a
lot
of
other
bottled
pale
ales
end
up
toward
the
amber
style
this
is
leaning
heavily
in
the
ipa
direction
plenty
of
satisfying
bitterness
from
the
cascade
hops
with
balancing
malts
providing
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
medium
body
and
carbonation
is
right
onyet
another
brew
from
great
lakes
that
would
surely
be
a
staple
if
it
were
more
available
to
me
get
this
one
if
you
can
notes
nice
smooth
and
mellow
one
of
those
examples
of
keeping
it
simple
this
is
my
first
attempt
at
reviewing
a
beer
i
drafted
this
review
before
reading
any
other
reviews
or
the
lable
let
me
know
your
opinion
or
sugguestions
d
i
am
not
a
hop
head
but
man
this
is
tasty
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
when
you
are
craving
something
a
little
bitter
nice
beer
md
the
feel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carb
livining
things
up
a
bit
very
impressive
i
get
hops
than
some
sweetness
than
some
bitterness
nothing
over
the
hill
hmmm
only
6
sign
me
up
this
is
a
beer
i
would
come
back
to
classic
apa
in
appearance
decent
head
with
some
lacing
smell
is
a
perfect
harmony
between
malt
and
hops
taste
is
also
a
good
balance
not
overly
complex
i
dont
typically
prefer
strong
malt
but
the
malt
i
was
picking
up
in
this
brew
was
very
attractive
to
me
posibly
a
malt
strain
i
have
never
tried
mouthfeel
is
an
average
apa
med
body
and
med
carbonation
goes
down
more
than
easy
and
youll
be
looking
for
a
second
one
at
6
its
a
perfect
blend
of
flavor
drinkability
price
imo
so
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
this
brew
i
highly
recomend
it
this
is
a
drinkable
apa
that
will
surprise
you
with
its
malt
character
have
no
idea
how
this
beer
won
a
gold
medal
or
so
many
rave
reviews
maybe
i
hit
a
bad
batch
d
ok
if
you
like
ipas
but
still
not
great
if
not
then
not
even
ok
d
very
drinkable
this
is
what
a
pale
ale
should
taste
like
i
absolutely
loved
it
this
is
less
citrus
and
pine
centric
than
most
pale
ales
i
enjoy
but
its
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
great
lakes
has
really
been
impressing
me
with
their
wellbalanced
beers
in
some
of
the
less
typically
flavorful
styles
d
at
6
its
no
session
beer
but
it
is
damn
drinkable
as
for
drinkability
i
finished
this
off
fairly
quickly
with
dinner
and
definitely
wouldnt
mind
another
one
but
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
pale
ale
i
guess
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
bit
more
on
the
crisp
and
refreshing
side
not
something
with
so
much
flavor
and
smell
mind
you
im
not
complaining
but
im
surprised
that
this
is
called
a
pale
ale
due
to
the
color
and
robust
flavors
d
could
drink
10
of
these
in
a
row
certainly
a
good
apa
just
shy
of
upper
echelon
brews
still
ok
but
seems
to
be
way
past
its
prime
even
though
it
was
technically
consumed
before
the
best
by
date
d
not
my
style
but
not
sorry
i
had
it
drinability
pretty
high
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
was
drank
outside
with
some
typical
bar
food
fare
and
it
really
cut
through
all
of
the
flavors
cheers
drinkability
though
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
another
greatly
versatile
beer
by
great
lakes
as
it
goes
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
and
is
refreshing
anytime
this
one
was
drinkable
and
somewhat
enjoyable
but
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
i
still
hold
to
the
opinion
that
this
brewery
is
somewhat
overrated
each
of
their
beers
that
i
have
tried
are
decent
but
theres
always
a
little
something
lacking
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
that
keeps
them
from
being
really
good
drinkability
is
great
just
what
an
apa
should
be
mildly
hoppy
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
presence
another
solid
brew
at
the
great
lakes
brewpub
cheers
d
very
good
but
wasnt
mind
blowing

me

i
have

good
a

drinkability
is
awesome
this
is
a
tastey
apa
that
is
refreshing
and
borderline
sessionable
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
it
makes
me
want
more
after
each
quaff
drinkability
i
found
this
beer
to
be
exceptional
so
far
this
might
be
my
favorite
apa
it
also
is
so
easy
to
drink
that
splitting
a
sixer
with
a
friend
while
watching
some
golf
sounds
like
the
perfect
thing
to
do
d
very
drinkable
pale
with
more
balance
and
character
than
most
pales
drinkibility
is
good
this
is
one
thatll
please
hopheads
and
one
that
i
could
drink
all
day
d
could
drink
this
all
day
for
8
99
you
get
your
moneys
worth
this
is
an
overall
great
brew
and
is
easily
a
bigger
bolder
one
than
some
ipas
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
because
the
edmund
fitzgerald
porter
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
beer
did
not
quite
live
up
to
the
porter
d
very
much
the
quintessential
apa
very
understated
which
is
a
nice
change
from
some
of
the
over
done
examples
out
there
could
certainly
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
very
easy
drinking
putting
two
or
three
of
these
babies
away
would
not
be
a
problem
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
does
its
job
without
jumping
up
and
down
saying
look
at
me
look
at
me
pretty
drinkable

with
moderate

this
is

picked
this
up
at

grocery
in

ny
on
a
trip
back
to
my
hometown
for
a
bachelor
party
its
great
to
see
such
a
cool
brewery
getting
more
distribution
and
i
would
love
to
see
alot
more
of
their
work
in
philadelphia
very
easy
to
drink
super
apa
or
aipa
well
done
great

d
really
surprised
to
like
this
apa
so
much
has
all
the
hop
kick
that
i
could
ask
for
without
feeling
to
overpowering
easily
drinkable
great
brew
d
for
a
pale
ale
i
would
say
this
is
highly
partakable
enjoy
this
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
and
beyond
d
this
is
my
go
to
beer
as
many
people
sit
with
a
6
of
some
bmc
i
will
sit
with
a
6
of
burning
river
easy
drinking
and
a
pleasant
taste
also
a
good
buy
just
because
this
beer
isnt
hyped
dont
turn
down
a
chance
to
try
this
solid
brew
right
here
guys
a
little
over
the
top
in
astringent
hops
but
a
very
nice
american
apa
my
bottle
says
to
enjoy
the
beer
before
052109
thats
about
seven
weeks
from
now
so
im
good
its
got
a
nice
deep
orangegold
color
good
foamy
head
retention
fruity
hop
aroma
similar
to
raspberries
pine
and
a
touch
of
citrus
as
well
as
malt
very
nice
flavor
is
perfectly
bittered
to
the
level
that
a
pale
ale
ought
to
be
with
sweet
fruitymalty
overtones
reflects
the
aroma
tremendously
and
in
a
great
way
nice
medium
body
with
perfect
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
great
beer
for
the
8
99
six
pack
price
d
very
drinkable
why
did
i
take
so
long
to
come
back
to
this
beer
one
of
my
original
favorites
from
the
state
of
ohio
im
going
to
make
this
my
summer
beer
this
year
along
with
alpha
king
d
very
drinkable
wellbalanced
and
shows
off
the
hops
nicely
but
with
enough
malt
behind
it
to
give
it
some
meat
on
its
bones
definitely
straddling
the
ipapale
ale
line
but
its
got
a
bit
more
backbone
and
less
bitterness
than
i
find
in
most
ipas
d
i
might
like
this
even
more
than
sn
though
its
a
close
race
thanks
to
drgonzo3705
for
this
extra
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
fell
slowly
and
kept
good
retention
the
aroma
is
nice
and
floral
slightly
grassy
with
some
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
and
sweet
caramel
malt
theres
a
very
nice
bitterness
to
the
flavor
its
slightly
sweet
at
first
some
toasty
biscuitlike
malts
make
up
the
backbone
becomes
slightly
medicinal
and
dry
on
the
finish
nice
use
of
bitter
hops
on
this
one
but
missing
some
hop
citrus
flavor
that
i
love
out
of
apas
medium
bodied
nice
crisp
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
reminds
me
a
lot
of
snpa
another
delicious
brew
from
great
lakes
they
havent
let
me
down
yet
highly
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
they
arent
reinventing
the
wheel
here
but
who
asked
them
to
glbc
strikes
again
this
apa
is
a
bit
different
from
others
that
i
have
tried
it
has
a
bit
added
complexity
in
the
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
but
was
not
bad
by
any
means
drinkability
im
not
sure
how
many
i
would
be
able
to
drink
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
pretty
good
easy
drinking
session
beer
all
and
all
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
hops
hit
the
back
of
the
mouth
in
a
pleasant
way
very
easy
to
drink
very
highly
recommended
notes
another
great
job
by
glbc
it
seems
everything
they
do
is
uppermiddle
class
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
a
1
fingered
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
nuts
the
flavor
is
nice
some
nutty
tones
to
it
a
nice
malt
base
and
a
decent
hop
aftertaste
some
citrus
and
some
pine
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
a
low
carbonation
level
and
a
slight
dry
aftertaste
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
beige
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
goodly
amounts
of
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
balanced
leaning
slightly
towards
piney
hops
taste
is
slight
vegetal
upfront
citrus
hops
in
the
middle
and
then
combination
through
the
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
about
the
same
things
just
dont
come
together
quite
as
well
as
i
would
hope
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
glass
raising
about
1
12
creamy
white
head
over
a
coppery
gold
amber
body
light
carbonation
the
scent
is
lemony
with
some
light
caramel
malt
and
light
bread
notes
very
understated
but
pleasant
as
is
the
taste
an
initial
caramel
bread
then
a
light
burst
of
lemony
and
grassy
hops
the
feel
is
full
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
with
the
hops
at
the
fore
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
tanninlike
feel
to
the
finish
good
stuff
and
for
what
its
worth
i
got
this
in
great
lakes
sampler
and
this
is
the
least
favorite
of
the
beers
it
contains
and
its
nice
to
find
a
sampler
without
the
ubiquitous
ipa
and
belgianstyledinspiredcopied
ale
in
the
mix
future
outlook
great
lakes
seems
to
make
consistently
solid
products
and
are
readily
available
for
me
so
i
anticipate
getting
this
again
d
a
well
brewed
apa
all
around
recommended
a
little
ashy
feel
more
fizzy
than
expected
a
decent
but
underwhelming
bitter
pale
md
light
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
to
it
nice
drinking
and
a
nice
round
of
hops
with
a
zesty
finish
definitely
could
be
a
drinker
poured
from
a
bottled
obtained
in
a
trade
pours
bright
copper
i
catch
an
orange
citrus
scent
def
some
dry
hopping
here
piny
hop
bitterness
up
front
that
is
quickly
muted
with
malts
malty
finish
medium
carbonation
this
is
very
sessionable
and
great
beer
for
anyone
that
wants
something
low
key
and
easy
going
very
drinkable
only
got
one
bottle
thats
too
bad
im
impressed
with
great
lakes
brewing
well
done
mouthfeel
light
bodied
and
slightly
oily
with
some
carbonation
i
love
this
beer
great
hoppy
taste
and
a
decent
foamy
head
as
well
just
a
wonderful
flavor
and
aroma
combo
had
this
beer
with
a
meat
and
cheese
sandwich
and
it
was
pretty
much
heaven
my
uncle
turned
me
on
to
this
one
as
an
employee
of
great
lakes
for
quite
some
time
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
definitely
worth
a
try
for
someone
who
hasnt
had
this
one
before
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
better
apas
i
have
had
i
would
drink
another
if
i
had
one
but
sadly
i
dont
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
great
lakes
gotta
love
that
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
snifter
small
half
a
fingers
worth
of
off
white
head
with
small
amount
of
carbonation
and
body
looked
a
golden
amber
at
first
i
got
whiffs
of
grassy
hops
aromas
and
then
noticed
a
little
citrus
zest
smell
maybe
of
grapefruit
or
oranges
got
a
little
of
the
grapefruit
zest
in
the
first
sip
as
well
as
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
it
left
my
mouth
coated
after
the
first
sip
and
had
a
lingering
aftertaste
seemed
like
the
ending
was
missing
a
little
something
and
i
can
quite
describe
the
after
taste
i
picked
this
one
up
on
my
way
thru
ohio
and
i
would
do
it
again
as
its
something
worth
drinking
this
beer
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
the
nice
and
strong
hop
character
really
took
me
by
surprise
after
the
sweetness
of
the
smell
very
complex
of
a
pale
ale
and
probably
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
how
can
you
resist
an
ale
commemorating
the
cuyahoga
river
fire
well
great
lakes
brewery
cant
grants
a
betterthan
average
pale
ale
that
i
eagerly
enjoyed
a
mediumshade
of
honey
pour
with
light
tan
lacey
head
and
sweet
honey
aroma
already
proved
its
appearance
well
a
smooth
hoppy
lemon
malt
flavor
where
nothing
overwhelmed
definitely
sat
nicely
left
me
wanting
more
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
in
warmer
weather
even
though
the
abv
is
6
00
i
could
easily
see
this
going
well
with
some
mildly
spicy
food
since
this
wont
burn
your
mouth
or
require
an
accompanying
glass
of
water
the
faint
metallic
hint
in
the
aftertaste
is
enough
to
make
me
want
more
and
realize
that
a
solid
pale
ale
is
always
a
good
thing
even
during
a
cold
snap
like
the
one
were
getting
this
week
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
that
is
well
served
by
its
active
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
just
suck
on
down
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
d
a
great
pale
ale
would
be
even
more
fantastic
on
a
summer
warmer
day
instead
of
the
middle

somewhat
slowly
and
leaves
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
fresh
hops
that
have
piney
and
citrus
notes
with
some
sweet
aromas
the
taste
starts
hoppy
with
hints
of
the
pine
flavors
moves
toward
the
citrus
and
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
bitter
notes
come
on
a
bit
stronger
in
the
aftertaste
but
still
are
very
light
compared
to
other
hoppy
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
somewhat
light
great
carbonation
nice
flavor
all
through
the
beer
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
a
very
well
crafted
beer
with
great
flavors
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
great
pale
ale
well
balanced
and
great
tasting
at
6
abv
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
session
beer
but
two
or
three
in
a
night
would
be
a
great
treat
deffinetly
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
enjoying
a
glbc
burning
river
is
like
visiting
an
old
friend
cheesey
i
know
in
that
i
use
to
drink
it
so
much
the
fact
that
you
can
get
it
at
any
minimart
in
columbus
shows
you
how
far
craft
beer
has
come
a
fantastic
apa
and
a
must
for
any
ba
this
apa
pours
a
slightly
hazed
amberish
orange
with
a
big
fat
pillow
of
creamy
head
that
slowly
recedes
leaving
tons
of
sticky
lacing
as
evidence
of
its
presence
this
smells
sweet
with
a
hoppy
profile
of
pine
and
some
buiscuty
malts
this
could
give
my
old
stand
by
sierra
nevada
pa
a
run
for
its
money
sn
is
very
one
dimensional
in
the
hop
profile
and
lack
of
maltwhile
burning
river
is
very
balancedwith
hops
conquering
the
weaker
malt
in
the
end
this
has
a
fruitycitrusy
middle
that
adds
that
third
dimension
that
really
puts
this
one
into
a
league
of
its
own
creamy
and
medium
bodied
with
just
the
right
texture
and
carbonation
high
drinkability
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
d
this
is
eminently
drinkable
due
to
its
balanced
flavor
and
nice
hop
profile
the
malty
spine
and
the
additional
fruity
complexity
keep
this
one
interesting
sip
after
sip
or
gulp
after
gulp
more
like
it
this
has
session
written
all
over
it
seriously
good
beer
here
d
this
is
definitely
close
to
an
ipa
in
style
and
its
very
well
done
and
extremely
well
balanced
despite
the
bold
flavor
i
remember
drinking
this
early
in
my
beer
career
and
finding
it
horribly
unbalanced
but
now
that
ive
expanded
my
palate
a
bit
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
another
great
brew
received
from
auslander
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
with
minimal
head
but
with
excellent
lacingwebbing
this
beer
smells
like
grassy
hops
and
pineapple
nice
smell
smooth
and
crisp
comes
across
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
apa
but
i
love
it
nice
bitter
hop
prescence
right
up
front
but
balanced
perfectly
by
the
sweet
malt
that
makes
this
everso
drinkable
some
citrus
also
pulls
through
slightly
i
was
excited
to
try
this
and
it
did
not
disappoint
easy
to
drink
left
me
wanting
more
i
wish
this
beer
were
more
readily
available
here
in
texas
i
might
have
to
make
some
trades
to
get
more
of
this
in
the
future
great
beer
one
of
the
few
i
keep
on
hand
with
some
regularity
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
extremely
floral
with
strong
hints
of
lively
hops
the
taste
is
very
flavorful
showcasing
a
wonderful
bouquet
of
spicy
hops
that
also
has
a
smooth
balance
the
taste
is
not
overpowering
but
very
balanced
the
bitterness
is
lacking
but
made
up
for
with
spice
i
enjoy
this
brew
but
as
far
as
a
pale
ale
it
is
a
little
off
solid
brew
for
the
price
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
have
a
couple
with
dinner
but
by
itself
it
may
fall
a
bit
flat
a
great
surprise
from
a
brewery
close
by
the
new
inlaws
d
goes
down
easy
and
its
mighty
tasty
pours
a
middle
of
the
road
amber
with
good
clarity
not
much
in
the
head
or
froth
department
ok
bubbling
though
the
aroma
has
a
strong
hop
with
some
orange
spice
and
a
little
white
pepper
the
taste
is
about
70
hops
and
40
malt
mild
toast
flaked
grain
but
plenty
of
juicey
orange
peel
hops
starts
sicey
and
finishes
lemonlime
juicy
palate
is
a
light
juice
to
thick
water
if
that
makes
sense
this
beer
is
great
on
tap
and
very
drinkable
this
ranks
right
up
there
for
me
as
one
of
the
most
drinkable
apas
out
there
easily
sessionable
if
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
it
would
be
a
stable
in
my
fridge
in
the
summer
drinkability
a
simple
and
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
one
went
famously
with
some
extra
sharp
cheddar
its
superbly
balanced
of
an
eminently
reasonable
alcohol
level
and
i
think
its
a
damn
fine
beer
my
first
experience
with
great
lakes
and
a
good
one
recommended
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
proves
simple
can
be
just
as
amazing
as
complex
theres
not
much
going
on
here
just
some
great
flavors
melding
perfectly
in
one
hell
of
a
pale
ale
taste
once
again
its
mostly
hops
some
malts
in
the
background
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
flavorful
yet
very
smooth
pours
deep
gold
with
a
nice
slightly
frothy
layer
of
head
with
very
nice
looking
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
this
is
what
i
would
like
to
see
poured
for
me
draft
at
any
restaurant
its
very
appealing
aroma
has
an
interesting
mixture
of
sweet
grains
and
citrus
sort
of
like
wine
grapes
theyve
created
an
interesting
beer
here
the
flavors
seem
to
transcend
what
youd
normally
expect
in
beer
i
mean
maybe
its
because
im
a
little
sick
but
i
think
i
pick
up
on
some
peanut
butter
in
the
taste
interesting
how
that
works
the
bittering
presence
is
right
for
the
style
but
decreases
the
drinkability
a
little
bit
for
me
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
with
the
rest
of
the
nice
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
and
otherwise
its
like
the
beer
is
yelling
out
at
you
to
drink
it
unfortunately
its
that
bittering
presence
that
sort
of
ruins
it
for
me
i
think
im
going
into
the
beer
thinking
that
its
going
to
be
more
like
an
oktoberfest
or
something
but
as
far
as
apas
go
its
right
up
there
d
a
classic
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
and
delicious
enough
as
well
everyone
should
check
this
one
out
d
a
beer
i
could
drink
everyday
but
im
partial
to
pale
ales
really
nice
offering
from
great
lakes
drinkability
a
sold
pale
ale
with
just
the
right
bite
from
the
hops
another
solid
beer
from
glbc
drinkability
great
session
beer
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
with
a
finish
that
doesnt
kill
your
palate
d
6
isnt
the
most
drinkable
but
this
is
a
nice
malty
but
still
hoppy
apa
definitely
would
have
again
given
the
chance
i
know
this
beer
must
be
way
better
when
fresh
but
it
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
this
one
was
alright
but
its
just
not
nearly
as
good
as
snpa
or
alpha
king
my
two
benchmarks
for
pale
ales
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
juicy
citrus
hops
and
a
light
honey
malt
very
nice
the
hops
stand
forefront
in
the
taste
a
nice
mellow
citrus
hop
there
is
a
light
malt
presence
to
keep
the
hops
honest
really
this
is
what
an
apa
should
taste
like
nice
noticable
american
hops
that
dont
smash
you
over
the
head
nice
moderate
feel
with
semisoft
carbonation
giving
the
brew
a
creamy
texture
a
near
perfect
apa
not
overly
hoppy
and
has
a
great
balance
prosit
mk
d
overall
a
very
good
brew
but
not
outstanding
easily
drinkable
d
i
find
myself
wanting
to
love
this
beer
but
it
just
is
missing
something
i
cant
decide
if
it
just
isnt
bitter
enough
or
if
i
would
rather
it
be
a
little
less
bitter
still
a
very
good
beer
and
considering
the
strong
hops
i
almost
expect
more
abv
a
very
good
american
pale
ale
t
lighter
body
with
very
strong
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
results
in
a
creamy
full
mouthfeel
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
body
is
well
balanced
between
strong
malty
biscuit
like
flavor
but
most
surprising
for
this
apa
is
this
very
strong
citrus
hop
bite
this
is
my
favorite
glbc
beer
and
also
one
the
biggest
most
flavorful
apas
ive
had
one
of
the
bigger
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
but
also
one
of
the
tastiest
borders
on
an
ipa
if
you
ask
me
and
if
they
changed
the
label
i
probably
wouldnt
flinch
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
one
more
often
wonderful
beer
yet
again
from
great
lakes
drinkability
is
outstanding
i
have
to
remind
myself
to
pace
myself
excellent
as
an
oneof
or
as
a
session
beer
this
is
a
permanent
part
of
my
rotation
and
i
try
to
have
it
at
least
every
other
week
at
a
minimum
pours
a
goldensquash
color
with
a
thin
head
lacing
is
surprisingly
persistent
the
smell
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
malty
notes
and
the
punch
of
hops
the
taste
is
silky
smooth
especially
for
a
pale
ale
the
slightly
bitter
hop
heavy
finish
remains
in
your
mouth
for
quite
a
while
the
finish
is
a
great
counter
to
the
exceptionally
well
balanced
taste
of
the
beer
as
you
first
drink
it
the
hops
are
never
overpowering
and
instead
work
well
with
the
malt
and
yeast
notes
to
make
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
very
smooth
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
the
course
of
a
night
great
beer
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
color
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
bubbles
rising
the
color
is
a
brilliant
orangish
amber
in
the
late
afternoon
sunshine
for
a
pale
ale
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
betrays
the
brews
hoppy
character
which
really
bursts
on
the
palate
as
a
floral
blossoming
of
flavor
a
lovely
smooth
silky
texture
makes
it
slide
languidly
down
the
back
of
the
tongue
leaving
a
wonderful
bitter
accent
at
the
finish
the
bitter
aftertaste
leaves
a
clean
lasting
freshness
in
your
mouth
a
truly
lovely
beer
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
wonderful
brew
from
great
lakes
they
continue
to
make
wonderful
craft
beers
and
this
is
their
flagship
enjoy
one
of
the
better
american
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
being
in
north
east
ohio
the
beers
from
great
lakes
brewing
are
always
readily
available
and
for
that
i
am
extremely
thankful
burning
river
is
amber
and
copper
in
color
pours
with
ample
head
and
leaves
a
nice
trail
of
lacing
as
i
empty
my
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
bursting
with
hop
flavors
comparable
with
most
ipas
pine
and
citrus
notes
are
further
detected
the
flavor
is
everything
a
pale
ale
should
be
well
hopped
with
abundant
malts
this
beer
is
always
an
enjoyable
experience
well
crafted
to
say
the
least
very
drinkable
it
disappeared
pretty
quickly
from
my
pint
glass
d
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
respect
has
a
decent
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
looks
rather
average
and
the
mild
off
flavor
just
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
i
would
try
this
fresh
and
rerate
but
as
its
stands
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
if
i
felt
like
it
md
swirls
around
the
mouth
to
create
a
slight
wooden
flavor
a
beer
you
could
stick
to
all
night
also
a
great
beer
to
convert
the
bud
crowd
as
it
is
a
very
easy
drink
but
still
has
some
flavor
hv
on
tap
at
jimmys
golden
colored
beer
with
a
creamy
head
aroma
is
bready
malts
with
grapefruit
and
pine
in
the
background
subtle
bitterness
with
more
of
the
bready
malts
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
i
actually
get
more
pine
and
citrus
towards
the
end
than
i
did
in
the
beginning
pours
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
really
big
rocky
head
that
stays
around
for
awhile
smell
is
nice
some
nice
citrusy
juicy
hops
taste
is
even
better
plenty
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
flavor
crisp
and
bittering
but
not
over
the
top
decent
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
very
smooth
ipa
another
fine
beer
from
gl
flavor
is
a
straight
blend
of
sweet
malt
possibly
specialty
and
robust
hops
that
is
very
pleasant
and
a
great
transition
into
a
smooth
even
midpalate
that
opens
up
into
a
citrusy
crisp
cleansing
finish
the
carbonation
level
is
on
the
higher
side
of
moderate
and
affords
the
perfect
complement
to
the
lighttomedium
body
this
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
and
i
prefer
it
on
the
colder
side
d
the
odd
cider
flavor
makes
this
one
hard
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
like
it
but
probably
wouldnt
order
another
one
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
i
will
have
this
again
only
wish
it
were
on
tap
around
here
a
solid
apa
good
hop
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
pallet
which
is
not
too
overpowering
though
strong
enough
to
fool
you
into
thinking
it
might
be
an
ipa
has
a
multitude
of
spices
for
smell
and
taste
as
well
as
a
hint
of
caramel
it
has
a
decent
mouth
feel
and
is
certainly
not
light
or
watery
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
stones
ruination
though
certainly
milder
this
beer
is
fantastic
on
its
own
but
do
not
drink
with
pasta
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
enough
hop
presence
to
make
it
nice
and
crisp
without
assaulting
the
taste
buds
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
definitely
worth
every
penny
of
the
8
50
six
highly
recommended
hope
to
find
in
half
cases
d
i
wasnt
thrilled
with
this
one
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
change
my
mind
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
small
dense
head
that
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
leaving
almost
no
lacing
smell
is
mostly
the
moderate
citrus
hops
with
a
significant
caramel
malt
background
in
the
smell
the
taste
starts
with
a
slight
hop
bit
before
giving
way
to
the
caramel
malts
there
was
also
a
definite
spice
presence
in
there
as
well
and
the
finish
had
the
slightest
pine
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
with
decent
carbonation
and
the
finish
was
actually
on
the
crisp
side
of
things
with
less
hop
bitterness
than
im
used
to
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
as
the
hop
profile
is
pretty
tame
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
though
not
the
most
daring
or
complex
apa
ive
had
itd
be
pretty
darn
nice
on
a
summer
afternoon
poured
a
nice
copperamber
color
with
generous
white
head
that
stayed
a
while
aroma
was
of
citrusy
hops
flavor
was
a
blend
of
floral
citrusy
piney
hops
pleasant
bitterness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
decent
lacing
on
glass
i
enjoyed
i
would
definitely
have
again
notes
hop
flavor
is
alive
and
strong
in
this
pale
ale
i
plan
to
keep
lots
of
ohio
friends
who
can
send
me
gl
beer
until
i
see
this
in
texas
d
excellently
drinkable
will
make
a
great
warm
weather
beer
or
one
to
enjoy
with
fried
foods
d
its
easy
to
drink
and
worth
picking
up
dark
amber
color
with
thick
head
poured
in
to
a
pint
glass
head
over
1
thick
leaves
good
rings
on
glass
very
average
one
dimensional
flavor
burnt
malty
nose
weak
on
the
hops
my
first
sampling
of
great
lakes
very
average
beer
harsh
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
bright
white
head
on
it
the
scent
is
really
nice
for
an
apa
loads
of
fresh
citrus
floral
notes
and
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
it
is
assertive
but
it
also
doesnt
cross
the
lines
into
other
bigger
beers
like
an
ipa
and
i
think
it
is
really
nice
and
refreshing
the
flavor
profile
is
a
good
balance
of
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
i
get
more
citrus
than
pine
in
the
flavor
profile
that
is
balanced
quite
well
with
the
almost
bready
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
maybe
slightly
above
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
really
nice
and
as
i
said
before
i
would
give
this
beer
a
permanent
home
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
locally
a
little
thicker
in
the
mouth
than
most
pale
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
slight
dryness
overall
impression
good
apa
skirts
the
line
with
an
english
pale
in
the
ocean
of
pale
ales
its
bound
to
get
lost
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
aftertaste
is
amazing
i
really
wish
this
stuff
was
available
out
here
on
the
west
coast
d
good
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
apa
notes
big
thanks
to
fiver29
for
the
awesome
great
lakes
extras
d
a
very
solid
brew
and
easy
to
drink
a
solid
pale
should
be
a
staple
in
any
breweries
lineup
but
many
fall
short
or
omit
it
entirely
kudos
to
great
lakes
for
a
wonderful
brew
d
in
the
right
mood
ill
gladly
sit
down
and
have
a
few
more
of
these
md
clean
medium
body
very
easy
drinking
and
would
make
for
an
excellent
session
beer
d
a
nicely
made
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
apas
highly
drinkable
i
always
want
another
one
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
which
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
consistent
breweries
there
is
d
very
drinkable
nice
sessionably
brew
not
a
big
extreme
beer
but
flavourful
very
well
balanced
pours
a
great
light
copperamber
color
with
good
head
and
nice
lacing
it
has
an
excellent
hoppy
aroma
very
floral
with
citrus
hints
great
taste
too
an
excellent
beer
with
great
hoppybitter
tastes
without
going
overboard
it
has
a
nice
citrusbitter
taset
with
a
great
bitter
aftertaste
a
nice
smooth
beer
that
is
well
worth
drinking
drinkability
is
good
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
at
6
abv
it
may
prove
too
heavy
for
a
true
session
beer
nice
theres
a
touch
of
cocoa
in
the
malt
that
really
sets
this
pale
ale
apart
nicely
otherwise
the
hops
provide
a
great
piney
hops
bite
overall
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
snpa
wannabes
with
the
slightly
dark
grains
and
more
rounded
yet
more
harsh
hops
in
use
it
may
not
be
crisp
but
its
mighty
tasty
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
overall
my
feeling
was
no
thanks
not
interested
my
second
brew
from
great
lakes
and
yet
another
tasty
and
interesting
brew
my
hats
off
to
them
for
sure
for
making
an
apa
that
kept
my
interest
from
first
pour
to
last
swallow
i
really
do
like
well
made
apas
i
was
let
down
with
this
one
not
that
it
was
bad
by
any
means
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
all
the
same
im
looking
forward
to
more
from
great
lakes
d
very
drinkable
nicely
hopped
quite
sessionable
purchased
as
6
pack
in
local
beerwine
distributor
for
8
99
retail
best
by
date
578
have
had
on
tap
before
out
east
but
forgot
about
until
i
saw
these
bottles
appearance
is
a
golden
amber
with
medium
bubble
lacy
head
that
adheres
well
to
glass
smell
is
citrus
burntsugar
hops
taste
is
citrusbitter
hops
but
surprisingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
deserves
the
overall
arating
for
pale
ales
not
the
best
but
a
darn
good
one
clear
light
orange
colored
pour
looks
kind
of
thin
but
holds
a
huge
white
head
smell
opf
the
hops
are
nice
but
a
bit
mild
for
an
ipa
i
thought
and
there
was
a
slight
mustiness
about
it
too
taste
was
mildly
hopped
initially
too
but
picked
up
a
bit
after
a
few
sips
light
sweetness
and
light
bodied
as
well
hops
come
through
for
a
nice
flavor
and
strength
but
this
still
feels
too
thin
and
a
bit
lacking
somehow
good
but
not
great
i
thought
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
small
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
great
with
some
nice
sweet
caramel
notes
and
grapefruity
hops
the
taste
starts
with
a
brief
bit
of
sweetness
that
is
quickly
taken
over
by
bitterness
all
over
the
middle
and
back
of
the
tongue
the
bitter
aftertaste
really
sticks
around
and
the
slightly
high
amount
of
carbonation
is
felt
strongly
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
pretty
good
apa
i
had
this
last
night
in
madison
wi
on
tap
and
i
was
very
pleased
evrything
about
this
beer
was
great
smelled
of
a
well
hopped
beer
the
taste
was
wellrounded
and
not
harsh
at
any
point
i
couldve
stayed
and
had
5
or
6
of
these
pretty
easily
moreys
bottom
line
without
a
doubt
the
best
apa
that
ive
had
this
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
however
if
you
dont
like
hops
you
may
want
to
work
your
way
up
to
this
one
very
drinkable
as
it
provides
enough
hops
for
purists
as
well
as
going
down
nice
easy
for
the
average
beer
drinker
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
been
served
d
not
too
complex
but
delicious
nonetheless
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
unless
its
on
sale
i
prefer
sn
pale
ale
to
this
any
day
but
ill
gladly
finish
the
sixer
d
probably
wont
buy
andor
trade
for
this
beer
again
but
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
at
least
give
it
a
go
pours
a
very
very
slightly
fogged
copper
amber
nose
is
mildly
perfume
toned
but
exhibits
a
much
more
stronger
citrus
tone
flavor
has
quite
a
zing
to
it
at
first
but
calms
down
enough
to
show
some
nice
hop
character
feel
is
smooth
and
it
has
a
fairly
full
carbonation
that
stays
on
the
tongue
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
consider
this
a
good
example
of
an
apa
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
ale
even
with
the
6
0
abv
with
the
freshness
date
you
will
always
know
if
your
drinking
this
ale
at
its
peak
i
would
consider
this
a
fairly
good
american
pale
ale
good
auroma
good
flavors
and
the
hops
are
not
too
overpowering
overall
a
fresh
and
taste
smell
and
i
like
its
edginess
i
would
have
like
a
little
more
balance
andor
complexity
definitely
will
drink
more
id
like
to
be
armed
with
these
during
cinco
de
mayo
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
great
lakes
never
ceases
to
impress
me
while
they
dont
really
have
much
in
the
line
of
beers
leaning
towards
the
extreme
side
of
the
spectrum
they
will
always
rank
in
my
top
5
breweries
by
ceaselessly
producing
great
tasting
beer
that
has
amazing
clarity
balance
and
mouthfeel
another
one
well
done
d
a
very
nice
pale
ale
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
hops
yet
you
can
enjoy
the
hops
without
being
destroyed
would
definitely
consider
this
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
eating
some
pizza
and
watching
the
game
another
great
and
well
balance
beer
from
gl
i
swear
this
brewery
just
has
the
ability
to
make
me
want
to
continue
to
reach
for
their
beer
they
all
have
a
ton
of
drinkability
and
all
are
tasty
not
a
lot
of
complexity
here
just
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
and
enough
malt
to
allow
the
hops
to
shine
it
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
example
of
the
style
and
another
top
of
the
line
brew
from
great
lakes
brewing
this
is
an
excellent
apa
for
those
who
love
the
taste
of
citrusy
hops
ill
be
having
many
more
and
yes
for
those
of
you
who
are
wondering
the
cuyahoga
river
did
catch
on
fire
and
this
beer
was
thus
named
this
is
a
pretty
nice
apa
it
poured
up
a
light
bronze
orange
colour
with
a
one
finger
thick
layer
of
froth
smell
was
rather
well
balanced
with
an
equal
presence
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
taste
too
seemed
balanced
nicely
with
sweet
malts
up
front
a
lovely
hop
biterness
on
the
finish
everything
about
this
seemed
well
proportioned
making
this
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
good
solid
effort
from
great
lakes
i
think
the
brew
could
be
closer
to
an
ipa
than
apa
but
still
a
pretty
stellar
beverage
in
the
drinkability
category
overall
this
was
a
pretty
damn
fine
ale
stayong
up
here
in
ohio
for
a
few
days
i
am
getting
to
try
all
these
nice
midwest
brews
and
this
is
one
i
would
be
glad
to
try
again
a
quality
ale
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
the
next
time
i
am
around
d
well
balanced
flavor
comes
out
much
better
at
warmer
temps
though
hops
feel
aggressive
the
flavor
is
mellow
enjoyable
pale
ale
not
a
bad
choice
good
drinkability
very
nice
beer
clear
red
amber
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
not
a
lot
of
lacing
might
as
well
put
this
one
in
a
mug
since
there
is
nothing
to
see
but
if
you
dont
look
at
it
this
is
a
great
everyday
beer
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
and
floral
undertones
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
good
mouthfeel
and
nice
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
snacks
while
watching
football
d
decent
pale
ale
with
a
pretty
longlasting
bitterness
for
the
style
just
a
bit
watery
on
the
palate
possibly
due
to
the
date
being
two
months
past
its
prime
not
overly
complex
mostly
caramel
and
bready
malts
with
citrus
hops
still
its
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
a
very
solid
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
food
it
can
be
a
real
go
to
beer
thanks
to
whoever
sent
me
this
beer
in
whatever
bif
it
was
sent
in
served
chilled
in
my
new
sam
adams
pint
glass
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
poured
a
beautiful
clear
rusty
copper
color
noticed
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
beer
was
topped
off
by
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
head
that
was
super
white
head
had
great
retention
and
left
huge
amounts
of
sticky
white
lace
behind
smell
was
of
floral
hops
minor
citrus
notes
and
tons
of
sweet
malt
and
bread
taste
was
quite
good
as
well
a
nice
mild
hoppiness
balanced
almost
perfectly
with
plenty
of
sweet
malt
also
noticed
slight
hints
of
yeast
orange
peel
seemed
a
bit
grainy
finished
rather
smooth
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
prickly
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
pours
a
clean
orangeish
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
small
dryness
and
a
small
citrus
grapefruty
hop
in
the
taste
a
dry
maltiness
small
hops
and
somewhat
earthy
a
smooth
small
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
hop
aftertaste
not
huge
in
aroma
and
decent
taste
somewhat
refreshing
and
and
easy
drinking
pours
a
super
clear
burnt
sunset
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
almost
nothing
stickiness
is
decent
a
bit
of
webbing
on
the
sides
smell
is
a
creamy
almost
peanut
butter
odor
with
a
nice
subtle
citrus
tingle
in
the
nose
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
bread
in
the
nose
taste
is
much
of
the
same
the
peanut
butter
flavor
emerges
again
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
but
is
quickly
taken
over
by
some
caramel
malt
aftertaste
is
actually
pretty
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
grassy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
feel
but
the
bubbles
are
nonexistant
to
the
eye
much
more
of
a
malty
pale
ale
than
a
hoppy
pale
ale
great
lakes
makes
amazing
stuff
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
all
in
all
a
nicely
done
pale
ale
just
not
my
preferred
style
easy
to
drink
and
a
really
delicious
ale

sessionable
ill

nice
balance

to
drink
another
great
contribution
from
great
lakes
i
have
yet
to
have
a
subpar
drink
from
them

an
ipa
in
bitterness
and
strength

am
really
starting
to
like
this
brewery

a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
well
balanced
aroma
of
pale
malts
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
breadlike
malt
taste
that
boasts
of
pale
and
bisquit
malts
along
with
a
nice
selection
of
floral
hops
the
bisquit
malts
blend
well
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
apa
im
always
a
fan
of
the
bisquit
malts
the
hop
selection
also
adds
a
nice
balanced
flavor
d
not
bad
but
not
great
theres
nothing
all
that
offensive
while
drinking
this
brew
except
the
alcoholtinged
finish
but
nothing
about
it
made
me
want
to
grab
another
one
right
away
either

a
nice
cleanclear
golden

some
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose

piny
and
lots
of

taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
with
lots
of
caramel
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
bitter
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
served
from
the
tap
pours
a
copper
dark
orange
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
along
with
some
floral
hoppy
notes
taste
is
very
hoppy
for
an
apa
with
a
floral
hop
presence
some
sweet
malt
is
also
there
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
highly
carbonated
as
well
this
is
another
great
offering
from
great
lakes
i
like
this
apa
a
lot
its
a
big
beer
for
a
pale
ale
d
very
high
d
great
for
the
summer
although
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pursue
this
one
keep
drinkin
southern
tier
everything
will
be
alright
a
great
drinking
beer
i
cant
believe
it
is
so
big
almost
an
ipa
i
love
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
and
my
first
great
lakes
product
the
flavor
is
nearmild
but
it
pulls
through
with
a
large
hop
presence
on
the
finish
some
light
wheaty
notes
coat
the
sides
of
the
palate
while
the
hops
get
more
aggressive
as
the
beer
warms
some
citrus
fruit
and
an
almost
metallic
copper
note
peek
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
above
average
for
a
pale
medium
body
wellcarbonated
and
crisp
with
a
nice
little
bite
to
remember
the
swig
by
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
its
tasty
refreshing
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
which
one
can
easily
manage
with
the
6
abv
nice
job
cleveland
drinkability
no
complaints
about
the
beer
in
general
appears
to
be
a
wellmade
apa
by
a
company
that
makes
good
beer
with
fantastic
names
and
imagery
a
touch
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
though
d
totally
sessionable
easy
to
drink
great
flavor
tastes
great
with
lots
of
different
food
anything
from
great
lakes
is
bound
to
be
a
winnner
very
drinkable
quenching
could
use
a
touch
more
dryness
but
thats
just
me
trying
to
find
something
to
be
picky
about
with
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
pale
ale
like
so
many
others
wouldnt
be

100
session
able
great
taste
thanks
dan
for
this
sample
drinkability
this
is
a
good
one
very
drinkable
d
forms
a
really
good
pale
ale
which
can
be
easily
be
drank
over
and
over
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
ever
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
six
pack
scratch
that
make
it
a
case
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
not
over
done
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
and
have
at
this
very
pub
in
one
sitting
picked
this
up
in
west
virginia
while
i
was
on
vacation
there
a
great
session
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
find
locally
it
pours
dark
golden
with
a
thin
head
that
sticks
around
and
creates
some
decent
lacing
the
smellis
lovely
with
beautifully
balanced
earthy
hops
and
a
light
malt
background
some
cherry
fruitiness
at
the
finish
the
taste
is
a
beautiful
example
of
a
pale
ale
relativeley
lightbodied
but
with
a
nice
fruity
and
bitter
flavor
throughout
cherries
and
orange
zest
and
earthy
hops
make
this
a
delightful
quaffer
nicely
balanced
and
crisp
but
full
mouthfeel
make
this
one
great
to
have
in
the
fridge
often
pours
pretty
light
amber
and
clear
with
a
white
head
of
foam
this
is
a
golden
ale
with
a
wonderful
cedarpine
aroma
but
the
taste
oh
my
crisp
toasted
malts
mix
wonderfully
with
cedar
hops
that
pave
the
way
to
a
dry
bitter
finish
so
simple
but
so
good
the
mouthfeel
trends
towards
light
from
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
ample
enough
i
think
this
is
my
new
favorite
pale
ale
a
little
strong
for
the
style
but
oh
well
ill
just
try
not
to
drink
too
many
d
it
fills
up
the
mouth
but
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
fantastic
pale
ale
perfect
mouthfeel
very
delicious
very
drinkable
drinkability
perfect
session
beer
not
too
filling
or
bloating
this
sis
a
good
beer
to
have
when
having
3
or
4
d
a
very
well
crated
pale
ale
and
one
of
the
finest
i
have
had
there
will
always
be
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
one
two
thumbs
up
a
friend
brought
this
back
from
ohio
wish
it
were
available
around
here
a
hoppy
yet
sufficiently
balanced
deliciously
smooth
pale
ale
burning
river
definitely
is
a
great
well
rounded
pa
and
very
crisp
and
clean
with
it
being
medium
bodied
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
that
is
good
for
any
season
definately
worth
a
try
bottle
courtesy
of
jdoolin
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
medium
white
bubbly
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
is
quite
dominant
and
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
quite
hoppy
with
some
real
citrusy
flavour
is
well
backed
by
some
generous
caramel
malt
body
is
quite
full
with
some
great
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
well
balance
amp
version
of
an
apa
pours
to
a
dark
gold
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingers
well
and
leaves
good
lacing
nice
hoppy
aroma
and
flavor
mouthfeel
was
tingly
and
bitter
with
the
bitterness
carrying
over
perfectly
into
the
nice
long
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
great
lakes
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
id
say
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
nothing
too
offensive
and
the
hops
are
a
bit
subdued
worth
a
try
d
very
good
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
and
leaves
some
lacing
behind
aroma
is
excellent
citrus
hops
and
really
jumps
out
at
you
taste
is
citrus
hops
with
some
resiny
pine
surprisingly
bitter
for
an
apa
has
more
characteristics
of
an
ipa
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
especially
for
an
apa
good
beer
but
not
great
poured
out
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
the
nose
was
fairly
sweet
accompanied
by
lemon
and
melon
the
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
sweet
with
grapefruit
pith
and
melon
had
a
medium
body
and
crisp
carbonation
was
a
nice
very
drinkable
brew
pours
a
slightly
amber
copper
color
lots
of
visible
bubbles
lots
of
nice
foam
that
disappears
after
a
couple
minutes
nose
is
fruity
and
floral
hops
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
solid
first
fairly
hoppy
floral
some
mild
caramel
malt
overall
mild
but
tasty
all
in
all
an
average
beverage
from
gl
prefer
the
holy
moses
or
the
darker
beers
d
a
real
nice
pale
ale
that
borders
on
the
ipa
catagory
incredible
balance
and
drinkability
refeshing
and
clean
recommended
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
which
really
adds
to
the
drinkability
goes
down
very
smooth
i
could
session
this
easily
drinkability
my
old
stand
by
from
glbc
usually
enjoyed
from
the
pub
on
draft
but
represented
nicely
in
the
bottle
this
one
goes
down
quickly
do
to
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
but
nicely
balaced
by
a
slight
hop
kick
at
6
abv
serveral
can
be
enjoyed
without
feeling
the
effects
the
next
day
especially
if
enjoyed
at
300
in
the
afternoon
not
a
superstar
here
but
certainly
an
above
average
apa
overall
a
good
beer
but
ive
had
many
apas
better
i
think
the
reason
is
the
earthiness
in
the
flavor
ive
noticed
this
in
several
other
gl
offerings
and
its
not
really
my
favorite
characteristic
in
a
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
very
sessionable
but
very
very
refreshing
this
is
definitely
a
bit
bigger
than
most
pale
ales
higher
abv
more
hop
bitterness
but
still
a
great
pale
ale
if
you
are
wary
of
ipas
however
this
may
not
be
a
pale
ale
for
you
as
its
sort
of
halfway
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
light
amber
almost
blond
in
the
glass
with
suprising
clarity
for
the
style
some
creamy
head
and
lacing
aroma
was
more
subtle
that
i
expected
some
lightmoderate
pine
notes
along
with
light
bready
qualities
and
a
touch
of
caramel
mixed
in
taste
was
initially
a
very
light
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
palate
followed
by
a
moderate
for
the
style
hop
bitterness
finish
was
clean
and
of
average
duration
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
dry
in
overall
texture
and
somewhat
astringent
pours
a
clean
amber
with
nice
carbonation
trails
and
a
dense
craggy
head
intense
lacing
smell
is
faint
floral
hops
maybe
some
sweet
citrus
taste
is
crisp
hops
tendered
somewhat
by
malt
a
nice
blend
the
bitterness
lingers
and
keeps
my
mouth
crisp
another
fine
great
lakes
brew
smells
of
slight
citrus
nice
florally
hop
presence
taste
is
well
balanced
grapefruity
hops
but
not
overly
pronounced
a
good
balance
of
maltyiness
as
well
highly
drinkable
well
worth
the
experience
this
is
the
typical
apa
a
sort
of
dumbed
down
ipa
not
thick
at
all
and
almost
slick
as
it
goes
down
still
no
trouble
actually
drinking
this
as
it
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
had
yet
being
exeptionally
tasting
great
looking
and
smelling
amazing
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
have
bought
612
packs
of
this
beverage
on
a
regular
basis
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
foamy
eggshell
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
aroma
consists
mainly
of
floral
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
note
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
buttery
malt
foundation
that
slowly
gives
way
to
a
floral
hop
flavor
providing
very
nice
balance
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
somewhat
oily
on
the
palate
but
thats
how
i
like
em
going
down
the
hatch
with
very
little
trouble
awesome
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
one
leans
in
the
light
bodied
direction
it
goes
down
really
easy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
during
the
summer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
great
lakes
beers
its
a
regular
in
my
fridge
try
it
overall
a
classic
tasting
pale
ale
with
little
to
no
flaws
this
is
your
patio
sipper
its
wellversed
but
still
knows
its
place
the
bottom
line
as
i
said
in
the
intro
its
a
classic
style
and
great
lakes
has
brought
their
own
twist
to
it
good
summer
style
brew
much
of
what
i
remember
from
drinking
from
the
bottle
however
on
tap
the
beer
comes
across
smoother
softer
and
much
more
bready
biscuity
than
i
remember
moderately
malty
and
yeasty
with
the
anticipated
perfumy
citrus
piney
hop
aromas
and
flavors
delicate
nearly
witlike
textures
creamy
silky
and
smooth
overall
not
as
inyourface
as
sierra
nevada
or
flying
dog
but
perhaps
better
balanced
and
to
think
i
nearly
forgot
how
well
this
beer
tasted
silly
me
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
short
quickly
falling
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
it
has
a
nice
clean
citrusy
smell
with
a
little
sweet
malt
backing
the
taste
is
dry
with
a
slightly
bitter
citrus
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
dry
its
a
very
drinkable
good
apa
pours
a
shade
darker
than
golden
and
a
fair
white
head
the
nose
displays
a
big
fruity
bouquet
honey
and
bitter
esters
the
mouth
is
a
little
hard
but
smoothes
out
as
the
carbonation
weaken
towards
the
end
the
hop
profile
here
is
dry
slightly
chalky
perfumy
florals
and
a
nice
spice
level
that
is
a
little
acidic
bready
grain
sweetness
from
the
pale
malts
the
finish
is
dry
and
spicy
with
some
alcohol
flavor
a
descent
offering
from
great
lakes
and
highly
drinkable
d
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
clean
and
crispall
the
makings
of
a
nice
session
brew
in
the
summer
definitely
worth
checking
this
one
out
this
is
classified
as
an
american
pale
ale
but
it
could
easily
pass
as
an
english
pale
ale
as
well
this
ale
begins
and
ends
dry
while
the
bittering
and
flavor
hops
dominate
there
is
enough
of
a
body
to
smooth
the
taste
out
the
carbonation
allows
for
a
complex
blend
of
hops
and
palecrystal
malts
to
come
through
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
commerical
pale
ales
ive
had
great
lakes
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
this
style
and
it
shows
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nice
balance
and
good
example
of
the
style
very
refreshing
beverage
with
a
nice
complexity
to
it
didnt
think
that
it
tasted
like
a
6
recommended
i
had
to
pour
the
beer
very
hard
to
get
any
head
and
the
head
left
in
no
time
leaving
every
little
behind
the
color
is
absolutely
clear
and
light
you
can
see
right
through
it
very
easily
the
smell
is
very
nice
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
like
its
a
little
old
but
the
bottle
says
best
before
22607
its
an
ok
taste
but
it
is
just
off
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
hard
i
dont
think
i
would
try
this
again
clear
orangered
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
pretty
hoppy
with
a
malt
backbone
taste
is
a
decent
hop
flavor
slight
malts
and
some
sour
citrus
nice
mouthfeel
is
great
super
smooth
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
nice
brew
from
glbc
cheers
the
body
is
good
with
a
good
a
sweeter
finish
and
a
nice
hidden
abv
although
6
isnt
exactly
big
it
has
a
nice
flavor
overall
and
a
crisp
and
light
wispy
finish
that
helps
accentuate
the
bitterness
i
would
never
pollute
a
river
with
this
gem
pours
a
deep
golden
yellow
and
the
thick
head
clings
to
the
glass
pine
comes
through
in
the
aroma
very
hoppy
and
quite
bitter
in
a
good
way
just
a
perfect
amount
of
citrus
comes
through
the
bitterness
and
cuts
it
quite
well
finishes
very
sweet
and
smooth
a
fantastic
tasting
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disipates
fairly
quickly
nice
carbonation
aroma
is
hops
and
spice
taste
is
malt
some
hop
bitterness
nice
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
prost
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
seemed
to
get
more
bitter
the
more
i
drank
it
weird
maybe
it
was
the
bufallo
chicken
i
had
an
hour
ago
perfect
bodycarbonation
balance
with
oiliness
well
under
control
this
is
easily
one
of
my
top5
session
brews
a
friend
brought
me
back
from
cleveland
a
mixed
sixpack
of
the
burning
river
nosferatu
and
eliot
ness
i
decided
to
try
the
burning
river
first
largely
because
of
its
appropriate
name
this
pours
a
diamondclear
amber
and
is
topped
off
by
a
modest
and
fleeting
beige
head
to
the
nose
there
was
not
much
bouquet
a
soft
malty
base
and
some
slight
citrus
the
taste
was
fuller
and
smokier
at
the
outset
than
i
would
have
expected
from
the
smell
maybe
they
really
did
want
to
capture
something
of
the
old
burning
river
and
there
was
definitely
a
hint
of
lime
in
the
aftertaste
i
rather
liked
the
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
not
at
all
unusual
for
an
american
pale
ale
a
worthy
brew
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
drinkablity
is
very
high
and
this
would
be
a
hit
for
bas
and
bud
drinkers
alike
this
is
my
1st
beer
from
this
brewery
and
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
cheers
d
tasty
and
easytodrink
not
too
filling
decent
kick
this
is
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
unless
youre
looking
for
something
heavier
drinkability
could
have
one
or
two
at
a
time
not
many
d
the
ale
has
a
nice
malty
grain
flavor
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
why
this
is
an
apa
defies
me
definitely
tastes
and
smells
ipa
all
the
way
a
good
bridge
beer
if
you
dont
want
something
pure
hops
and
dont
want
something
real
malty
enjoyable
experience
get
my
buzz
ony
most
definitely
drinkable
a
fine
product
got
this
with
the
great
lakes
sampler
pack
which
i
highly
recommend
poured
from
the
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
maintained
a
copper
tone
with
acceptable
lacing
and
head
the
aroma
was
strong
with
hints
of
pine
and
pepper
strong
flavors
in
this
one
i
feel
that
if
you
like
an
ipa
youll
be
more
pleased
with
this
than
the
average
apa
drinker
overall
very
drinkable
and
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
very
good
apa
experience
this
beer
has
more
kick
than
your
average
apa
highlt
recommended
gotta
love
the
name
too
great
lakes
takes
a
dark
moment
in
cleveland
history
and
turns
it
into
a
great
beer
that
a
way
glb
doing
your
best
to
boost
the
cleveland
image
clean
tasty
lowish
abv
a
very
good
beer
in
many
respects
whether
it
be
party
application
or
dinner
with
the
lady
also
whenever
i
have
this
much
grapefruit
and
pine
in
a
beer
its
usually
labeled
an
ipa
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
from
greatlakes
besides
there
blackout
stout
this
beer
makes
me
proud
to
be
born
in
ohio
taste
strikes
a
really
nice
balance
juicy
without
being
too
sweet
mild
carbonation
and
a
light
mixture
of
pineyfloral
hops
that
stay
well
within
sane
apa
bounds
very
light
hints
of
pepper
towards
the
finish
stands
out
in
the
crowd
of
just
another
pales
for
its
almost
perfect
equilibrium
another
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
as
they
all
should
be
d
i
must
say
not
an
aptly
named
beer
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
pale
ales
but
i
like
this
one
actually
has
some
character
to
it
the
pour
into
my
spaten
becker
raises
a
fastfalling
one
finger
white
head
with
some
large
bubbles
over
a
bright
goldencopper
body
lacing
is
sticky
but
thin
the
smell
is
midly
caramelly
and
sweet
but
dominated
by
the
piney
grapefruity
resinous
hops
actually
there
seems
to
be
a
balance
here
the
taste
is
actually
quite
mild
not
as
sweet
as
expected
but
not
as
hoppy
either
gls
beers
are
certainly
showing
a
lot
of
balance
in
todays
triple
tasting
the
mouth
is
medium
with
again
some
very
fine
smooth
carbonation
the
hoppiness
does
build
perhaps
hurting
drinkability
a
bit
they
know
how
to
build
good
drinkers
in
cleveland
crisp
and
refreshing
pa
im
looking
forward
to
a
few
more
six
packs
next
spring
this
is
a
good
warm
weather
drinker
crap
im
getting
thirsty
just
remembering
the
brew
d
it
was
fun
to
try
but
not
really
my
taste
copper
amber
body
with
a
dense
light
sandy
flecked
head
that
sticks
around
caramel
and
fruit
malts
prominent
light
buttered
bread
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
toasted
caramel
sweet
maltiness
up
front
citrusy
hops
come
in
and
provide
solid
balance
fruity
malt
in
an
otherwise
bitter
finish
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
medium
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
eric
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
strong
on
the
hops
but
not
overthetop
trying
to
be
an
ipa
i
think
its
a
great
session
beer
albeit
a
bit
strong
alcoholwise
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
a
damn
fine
pale
ale
on
the
whole
this
is
probably
better
classed
as
an
ipa
and
i
had
to
score
it
down
a
notch
for
being
imho
mislabeled
if
ipas
are
your
thing
though
its
one
of
the
better
ones
in
its
class
i
have
yet
to
have
a
glbc
beer
that
i
didnt
like
this
could
just
as
easily
be
considered
an
ipa
though
pours
with
white
creamy
head
golden
amber
color
very
clear
for
the
color
piney
citrisy
aroma
sweet
malty
taste
piney
citusy
aftertaste
just
like
the
aroma
really
makes
you
mouth
water
for
more
i
have
this
beer
on
my
home
draught
system
several
times
a
year
everybody
really
enjoys
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
not
too
big
or
heavy
if
i
was
in
ohio
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
regular
purchase
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
brown
it
gives
an
excellent
head
that
is
nice
and
creamy
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
smell
has
nice
floral
and
hoppy
auromas
which
is
the
same
with
the
taste
which
has
a
good
hoppy
bitter
ending
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
flat
medium
bodied
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
mfd
this
is
a
tad
dry
but
overall
pretty
slick
this
is
very
drinkable
and
i
do
agree
that
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
its
a
mostly
clear
rich
amber
with
a
nice
dry
stiff
head
almost
like
beaten
egg
white
the
aroma
is
rich
and
complex
warm
malt
scent
fresh
hops
and
a
hint
of
spice
and
earthiness
its
perhaps
a
little
more
full
bodied
than
most
apas
with
relatively
low
carbonation
but
just
enough
to
tingle
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
excellent
full
and
well
balanced
you
taste
sweet
malts
tart
hops
a
bare
spark
of
alcohol
and
a
perfect
yeasty
bite
in
the
aftertaste
but
none
steps
on
the
others
its
extremely
wellcrafted
and
as
with
all
gl
products
its
a
great
value
pours
a
pretty
goldenorange
color
with
a
pretty
creamy
white
head
that
takes
its
time
sauntering
down
to
a
thin
layer
beautiful
aroma
of
crisp
floral
hops
light
sweet
malt
and
notes
of
caramel
pine
and
grapefruit
palate
is
a
tasty
blend
of
crisp
floral
hops
and
light
sweet
caramel
malt
a
tangy
piney
finish
comes
through
with
a
hint
of
zesty
citrus
body
is
light
yet
creamy
with
a
clean
finish
good
lord
i
wish
i
had
purchased
more
than
one
of
these
hopefully
theyll
expand
distribution
to
the
west
coast
soon
overall
this
is
just
a
fantastic
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
if
not
the
best
fairly
priced
so
dont
hesitate
to
pick
this
one
up
when
you
see
it
this
is
right
up
there
with
stone
pale
ale
fantastic
beer
drinkabitly
is
great
a
very
good
session
beer
except
for
maybe
the
6
overall
a
great
apa
d
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
one
that
i
will
definitley
go
back
to
a
good
but
not
great
brew
certainly
recommended
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
complexity
the
hop
bite
is
slightly
harsh
and
one
dimentional
lacking
the
full
flavor
i
would
prefer
another
good
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
while
i
prefer
the
commodore
perry
to
this
its
pretty
tasty
a
very
good
drinkable
pale
ale
great
summertime
brew
thats
my
impression
of
burning
river
pale
its
good
but
not
fantastic
in
every
category
this
would
make
for
a
good
safe
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
good
not
great
but
not
controversial
and
can
be
easily
forgotten
about
its
the
kent
hrbek
of
beers
medium
bodied
with
an
evident
hoppy
prickly
texture
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
this
was
just
another
beer
by
my
standards
the
appearnce
was
nothing
unique
with
a
golden
color
and
a
moderate
head
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
almost
bitter
the
taste
was
mild
at
first
with
a
powerful
bitter
finish
dominant
hop
flavors
overpower
the
other
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
caulky
and
thin
but
is
someone
expected
from
the
smell
and
color
so
not
a
bad
trait
over
all
drinkability
isnt
fantastic
but
good
for
a
tasting
with
friends
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
medium
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
strong
of
hops
and
grassy
notes
are
present
tastes
like
your
slightly
above
average
pale
ale
but
isnt
remarkable
overall
a
solid
beer
to
drink
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
affordable
lighter
fare
pours
clear
and
bright
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
fades
to
lacing
on
the
edges
earthy
hops
and
grainy
malt
dominate
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
hops
come
out
first
but
then
the
grains
take
over
with
some
intensely
cereallike
flavors
its
a
bit
too
grainy
for
my
taste
the
end
of
the
palate
and
the
finish
are
pure
vienna
malts
nonetheless
it
goes
down
smooth
and
its
interesting
enough
decent
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
transparent
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
disipates
down
to
nothing
fairly
quickly
smell
of
grassy
hops
some
pine
in
there
too
covering
a
subdued
malt
profile
tastes
much
like
the
smell
but
not
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
the
same
notes
are
there
but
every
flavor
is
toned
down
a
bit
in
comparison
to
what
i
found
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
high
because
of
its
smooth
texture
and
low
abv
i
would
have
no
problem
hammering
back
a
few
of
these
definitely
one
glbcs
weaker
offerings
drinkability
the
clean
finish
and
nonheavy
body
helps
this
go
down
smooth
bottom
line
its
neckandneck
with
snpa
i
still
give
the
apa
edge
to
sierra
nevada
with
great
lakes
edmund
fitzgerald
a
slight
favorite
over
sn
porter
you
will
not
go
wrong
with
this
beer
drinkability
this
goes
down
very
easy
and
i
can
have
several
of
these
in
a
session
a
really
good
brew
one
for
the
hop
cultists
yet
mild
mannered
enough
to
possibly
help
your
nonba
friends
get
that
old
time
hop
religion
this
is
a
temendous
brew
high
quality
to
say
the
least
some
malt
on
the
front
terrific
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
back
the
water
well
its
great
lakes
almost
has
a
toasted
almond
flavor
in
the
malt
great
citrusy
love
down
the
middle
an
awesome
brew
an
awesome
session
brew
very
highly
recommended
man
im
gonna
miss
these
guys
pretty
good
pale
ale
though
somewhat
overrated
imo
the
aroma
is
its
best
quality
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
malt
still
worth
trying
though
6
alcohol
and
cant
tell
at
all
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
begs
you
to
take
sip
after
sip
woah
this
is
going
down
fast
great
beer
from
great
lakes
another
fine
product
form
great
lakes
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
i
mean
it
when
i
say
good
it
didnt
captivate
me
like
a
great
beer
would
have
it
had
a
nice
copper
color
to
it
and
a
nice
citrushoppy
aroma
as
well
as
all
apa
should
it
had
a
nice
hop
taste
to
it
cheers2beers
amber
in
color
flowery
in
smell
with
the
usual
hops
overtones
in
an
ipa
good
mouthfeel
and
incredibly
drinkable
as
i
had
4
in
my
sitting
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
had
incredibly
balanced
nice
aftertaste
of
hops
and
not
overhopped
which
can
be
a
tendency
in
this
ipa
climate
i
highly
reccommend
this
beer
d
this
beer
is
near
pefection
for
an
apa
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
im
stupid
a
lite
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
disappates
very
quickly
a
slight
scent
of
roasted
barley
with
a
string
citrus
hop
aroma
at
the
end
the
taste
starts
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
then
the
hop
flavor
begins
to
dominate
the
taste
in
the
mouth
it
feels
watery
with
a
slight
tingle
from
the
carbonation
even
with
the
lite
look
and
faint
scents
the
flavor
was
fairly
good
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
disappointing
but
overal
this
is
at
best
an
average
beer
oprobably
would
pair
this
with
some
food
for
future
drinks
great
big
apa
go
for
it
if
you
are
hop
head
looking
for
a
lighter
fix
than
a
barleywine
or
dipa
fairly
smooth
it
would
be
a
bit
smoother
if
it
werent
quite
this
hoppy
not
overthetop
hoppy
but
a
bit
high
for
the
style
imo
a
mediumbodied
offering
fairly
clean
finish
would
like
more
aftertaste
from
such
a
good
tasting
brew
it
comes
across
as
kind
of
a
weak
brother
to
an
ipa
in
regards
to
the
hop
level
and
the
flavor
all
over
a
good
beer
wish
it
was
available
in
fl
drinkability
dry
mouthfeel
leads
me
to
believe
this
brew
is
lighter
than
it
is
very
easy
drinker
doesnt
make
you
full
too
quickly
with
ample
alcohol
to
give
you
a
slight
buzz
if
you
imbibe
too
quickly
or
too
much
drinkability
is
among
the
best
a
damn
tasty
beer
that
isnt
extreme
in
any
respect
what
makes
this
beer
is
a
lot
of
great
qualities
extremely
well
executed
a
malty
spicy
and
smoky
pale
ale
that
doesnt
get
tiresome
at
all
in
your
mouth
a
superior
apa
in
all
respects
notes
a
very
solid
beer
and
onme
of
the
best
apas
out
there
if
you
like
them
this
hoppy
this
beer
is
growing
on
me
and
will
pick
some
up
in
the
future
served
cool
from
12
oz
bottle
in
pint
glass
on
12406
clear
copper
color
with
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
leaving
only
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
lasting
forever
smell
was
citrusy
and
floral
hops
and
not
much
else
dominant
is
floral
hops
with
some
citrus
malt
is
evident
more
than
other
apas
i
have
tried
although
hops
still
prevail
pleasant
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
although
right
now
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
hops
no
doubt
that
will
change
with
time
and
my
score
of
this
beer
will
improve
12oz
bottle
had
straight
from
bottle
couldnt
say
much
about
appearance
for
this
reason
my
guess
is
a
typical
ipa
yellow
orange
that
isnt
transparent
bc
of
the
strong
smell
i
could
smell
the
strong
hop
element
most
apparent
of
anything
else
has
a
good
body
to
it
a
certain
crispness
that
is
associated
to
pale
ales
but
this
was
a
little
too
harsh
for
me
the
strength
of
the
hops
and
the
6
00
abv
took
me
off
guard
leaves
a
bitterness
from
these
two
elements
that
i
didnt
find
very
pleasant
so
an
average
score
for
drinkability
im
definitely
not
dissing
this
beer
you
just
have
to
know
what
to
expect
from
it
flavor
is
hoppy
per
the
style
with
some
grapefruit
flavors
coming
through
with
some
orange
citric
notes
but
the
malt
is
a
little
stronger
than
what
im
used
to
biscuity
almost
like
pretzels
on
the
first
sips
strong
and
nice
really
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
i
think
but
it
is
refreshing
unfortunately
for
some
reason
i
cant
drink
too
much
burning
river
in
one
sitting
i
enjoy
it
but
it
tends
to
upset
my
stomach
much
the
same
way
grapefruit
juice
does
and
i
feel
sick
i
love
the
beer
and
i
love
to
start
the
night
with
a
pint
of
it
but
its
not
something
i
can
continue
drinking
it
took
awhile
for
me
to
come
around
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
best
by
date
of
dec
02
2005
had
this
single
bottle
from
some
local
shop
during
my
last
night
in
madison
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
as
it
seems
that
some
of
the
other
reviewers
found
more
floral
hops
in
their
samples
excellent
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
this
beer
has
an
excellent
nose
to
go
along
with
it
great
hoppy
characteristics
burning
river
is
very
true
to
style
a
good
beer
to
serve
when
introducing
novices
to
different
styles
of
beer
stands
well
against
its
big
brother
nosforatu
another
of
great
lakes
offerings
after
popping
the
top
my
first
thought
was
i
was
smelling
a
porter
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
citrus
mostly
orange
it
has
a
good
blast
of
hops
the
color
is
dark
amber
the
head
was
small
and
didnt
last
long
i
bought
this
on
sale
the
normal
price
is
a
little
high
it
is
good
but
not
8
per
six
pack
good
drinkability
this
is
one
that
i
never
get
tired
of
a
great
session
brew
from
the
north
coast
clear
amberorange
with
nice
fluffy
head
and
moderate
carbonation
floral
pine
and
citrus
zest
in
the
nose
bicuity
malt
too
the
first
sip
is
quite
sturdy
in
hop
content
biscuit
dough
malt
in
the
middle
and
a
wonderfully
bitter
citrus
hop
finish
bergamot
and
grapefruit
pith
the
flavors
are
superbly
balanced
in
this
one
a
not
unpleasant
mineral
taste
lingers
for
just
a
second
the
mouthfeel
is
doughy
and
medium
bodied
quite
nice
more
than
adequate
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
too
drinkability
very
high
if
the
price
were
comparable
id
pick
this
one
over
snpa
the
extra
hoppiness
of
this
pale
ale
gives
it
a
slight
edge
over
that
champ
in
my
book
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
for
hopheads
short
dense
offwhite
head
with
plenty
of
clumpy
lacing
clear
golden
amber
colour
citrus
hop
aroma
slight
floral
character
with
sweet
biscuity
malt
good
balance
between
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
to
start
citrusy
flavour
with
a
bit
of
floral
hop
and
pine
resin
fill
out
the
middle
bitterness
grows
and
lingers
in
the
finish
but
never
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
flavour
mediumlight
body
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
overall
this
is
a
great
apa
ipa
quality
hoppiness
and
bitterness
but
not
quite
as
much
as
alpha
king
actually
this
brew
is
only
just
a
small
step
down
from
the
alpha
king
balancing
malts
with
easy
to
drink
characteristics
make
this
a
helluva
session
brew
i
prefer
the
alpha
king
but
i
know
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
very
good
beer
all
around
full
flavor
that
sticks
it
deadon
all
the
way
from
the
start
to
the
finish
great
lakes
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
kudos
to
the
brewer
on
this
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
pertty
good
i
am
in
favor
of
the
amount
of
carbonation
that
this
beer
has
overall
this
beer
feels
quite
good
on
the
palate
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
beer
in
the
future
i
am
quite
amazed
at
how
much
i
like
it
overall
a
great
apa
from
my
favorite
brewery
these
people
really
know
what
theyre
doing
excellent
beer
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
bitter
and
hoppy
but
not
in
any
sense
unpalatable
substantial
enough
to
make
its
presence
known
but
would
be
a
good
session
beer
nonetheless
cheers
pours
a
golden
light
amber
with

tight
snow
white
head
and
a
hint
of
spotty
lacing
nose
is
full
with
floralfruity
hops
and
a
solid
malt
body
taste
continues
with
the
mellow
but
complex
floralherbal
hops
some
tropical
fruit
grapefruit
and
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
with
thin
fine
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
this
is
a
damn
tasty
apa
here
im
not
exactly
a
hophead
yet
so
i
really
enjoyed
the
subtle
but
complex
and
present
floral
hops
probably
my
favorite
pale
ale
of
any
type
to
date
great
lakes
has
another
winner
here
this
beer
is
a
tough
one
to
judge
i
think
it
could
be
hitting
my
palate
the
wrong
way
and
i
might
like
it
better
the
next
time
i
try
it
probably
better
on
draught
too
worth
trying
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
surely
offer
to
my
pa
drinking
friends
pours
a
beautfiul
clear
dark
copper
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
smells
very
good
citrusy
hops
some
sweet
fruit
character
taste
is
mostly
nice
citrusy
hops
but
there
are
some
complexities
here
as
well
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitterness
body
is
medium
to
full
and
rather
dry
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
nice
pale
ale
overall
bad
river
good
beer
a
great
offering
from
glbc
very
unique
apa
which
i
find
to
be
the
single
greatest
attrbiute
of
an
apa
because
theres
so
damn
many
of
them
this
oe
sticks
out
in
my
mind
though
becuase
of
the
slight
sweetness
and
that
rotten
bread
smell
good
beer
but
not
a
session
apa
imo
not
as
drinkable
as
an
apa
should
be
imo
this
is
my
second
beer
from
great
lakes
i
have
have
to
say
these
guys
are
about
two
steps
off
from
becoming
a
major
contender
in
the
micro
brewing
world
poured
out
to
a
nice
orange
yellow
color
with
a
very
short
lived
head
low
carbonation
no
lace
in
the
glass
aromas
of
orange
and
clove
are
very
present
as
are
notes
of
pine
and
earth
flavor
was
a
bit
on
the
flat
side
as
this
beer
could
have
benefited
from
higher
carbonation
to
liven
up
the
taste
flavors
of
hops
and
malt
with
traces
of
citrus
and
a
tea
like
finish
not
bad
but
like
i
said
the
addition
of
more
carbonation
would
really
kick
this
brew
up
a
notch
decent
mouthfeel
id
have
another
but
not
before
trying
something
else
i
really
feel
great
lakes
is
on
to
something
with
their
beers
but
somewhere
its
just
not
connecting
still
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
try
another
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
that
i
am
just
getting
around
to
rating
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
drink
with
a
great
juicy
hop
flavor
a
wellbuilt
easydrinking
beer
an
excellent
pale
ale
with
more
hops
and
bitterness
than
many
so
called
ipas
out
there
the
body
is
a
rich
redamber
color
with
a
sticky
fine
head
of
off
white
smell
is
of
juicy
hops
with
a
sweet
noble
air
to
them
dont
quote
me
on
that
medium
body
with
a
nice
sugary
caramel
flavor
though
clean
and
dry
perfect
balance
with
the
sweet
and
citrusy
hops
orange
lemon
and
pine
tar
outstanding
and
deserving
of
its
many
accolades
great
lakes
turns
out
some
awesome
beers
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
doubt
ill
have
another
in
the
near
future
thanks
vwcraig
for
the
opportunity
to
revisit
a
clear
dark
copper
colour
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
head
that
disipated
quickly
very
faint
aroma
it
starts
with
a
slighly
sweet
malt
flavour
but
finishes
very
very
dry
with
slight
bitter
and
grassy
flavours
it
seems
to
lean
more
towards
being
an
ipa
then
just
a
pale
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
but
the
very
dry
finish
left
me
wanting
to
follow
it
with
something
a
little
more
refreshing
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
reddish
hues
a
huge
white
head
caps
it
off
the
aroma
is
big
and
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
hoppy
yet
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
apa
it
is
nice
and
hoppy
without
being
so
hoppy
that
it
verges
into
ipa
territory
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
deep
amber
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
decent
head
retention
followed
by
mild
lacing
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
malt
esters
rich
malt
taste
upfront
followed
by
pronounced
hops
and
residual
sweetness
fairly
well
balanced
for
an
american
pale
ale
light
to
medium
bodied
the
low
carbonation
and
strong
aftertaste
make
this
less
smooth
but
more
robust
12oz
bottle
with
best
by
date
of
33005
i
tasted
on
72905
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
acceptable
head
aroma
is
citrous
and
very
nice
bitterness
is
low
but
fits
very
well
with
the
malt
profile
althought
this
bottle
may
have
degraded
somewhat
by
age
im
guessing
fresh
from
the
keg
this
would
really
be
something
special
a
clean
copper
colored
beer
has
a
big
foamy
beige
head
with
some
lace
there
is
a
sweet
malty
cereal
aroma
with
a
creamed
corn
note
in
the
background
a
start
of
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
followed
a
a
light
dry
peppery
hop
finish
easy
drinking
but
i
was
put
of
by
the
corn
note
in
the
aroma
this
is
the
brew
i
would
use
to
intoduce
friends
and
family
to
the
craft
brew
scene
looking
foward
to
trying
their
others
the
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
despite
the
lack
of
head
there
did
appear
to
be
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
mix
of
grapefruit
rind
from
the
hops
and
toffeecaramel
and
dates
from
the
malt
the
taste
has
more
citrus
than
the
nose
suggested
it
really
comes
on
strong
up
front
the
caramel
malt
comes
midway
through
the
flavor
and
the
finish
has
a
nice
sharp
bite
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
richness
for
a
pale
ale
all
together
this
presents
a
nice
drinakbility
nice
golden
colora
slight
touch
of
coppery
hue
to
it
low
aroma
more
yeast
then
anything
very
nice
hop
flavor
and
a
soft
malty
sweetness
to
tie
it
all
together
too
many
pale
ales
are
cascadeish
like
sierra
nevada
which
is
great
mind
you
or
so
bitter
they
just
dont
gel
this
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
the
2
flavors
good
body
as
well
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
pale
ale
example
taste
is
very
bitter
and
bitingly
so
no
subtle
citrus
nuance
no
floral
complexity
just
a
cutting
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
and
i
like
it
after
awhile
you
can
pick
out
some
fruity
malt
but
this
is
a
vehicle
for
delivering
hops
to
the
bloodstream
a
lingering
hoppy
bitterness
very
long
not
so
hoppy
to
be
an
ipa
but
really
close
a
hops
showcase
pretty
good
a
nice
pale
ale
almost
bordering
on
ipa
but
not
quite
there
nicely
done
great
lakes
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
if
you
are
a
lover
of
pale
ales
another
good
one
from
great
lakes
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
and
yet
another
excellent
brew
from
great
lakes
i
was
pleased
with
this
beer
and
its
overall
flavor
reminds
me
of
dogfish
head
60
minute
ipa
great
well
rounded
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
as
others
have
noted
it
is
almost
in
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
the
beer
pours
an
ambered
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
of
foam
over
top
very
pretty
color
the
nose
is
very
clean
good
crisp
citrusy
hop
and
a
well
blended
caramel
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
smelled
in
a
while
the
flavor
is
good
as
well
a
slight
bitter
on
the
start
moving
to
a
spicey
and
peppery
hop
the
caramel
malt
dances
lightly
in
the
background
the
hop
carries
through
as
a
light
bitter
in
the
background
very
nice
flavor
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
and
nose
work
very
well
together
definately
a
session
beer
i
give
it
an
a
i
cant
believe
something
so
tasty
is
named
in
honor
of
a
river
that
was
so
polluted
it
caught
on
fire
i
need
something
special
for
a
pale
ale
to
stand
out
this
one
was
good
but
not
great
hoppy
but
with
average
mouthfeel
for
the
style
great
name
and
label
nice
sense
of
humor
no
real
head
or
lacing
aokay
carbonation
could
have
been
better
but
nothing
to
complain
about
either
yup
hops
on
the
tongue
crisp
enjoyable
some
malts
occassionaly
break
through
but
this
beer
is
about
hops
after
the
mild
break
on
the
pallete
and
the
whisper
of
some
spice
more
unique
hops
rise
on
the
throat
with
a
bitter
finish
this
is
as
good
a
pale
ale
as
youll
find
and
it
goes
excellent
with
a
variety
of
strong
spicy
foods
i
couldnt
drink
these
one
after
the
other
but
one
is
very
nice
and
worth
trying
the
appearance
was
dominated
by
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
noticeable
carbonation
nice
thin
head
good
retention
but
nothing
extraordinary
to
the
eye
a
subtle
fruity
hop
aroma
was
detected
but
i
expected
to
find
a
little
more
in
this
department
the
taste
was
mildly
bitter
but
with
a
nice
allaround
balance
again
nothing
too
fancy
or
remarkable
but
not
disappointing
either
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
a
little
fuller
than
i
expected
from
the
initial
appearance
but
the
added
body
rounded
out
the
brew
farily
well
nice
session
drink
drinkablity
yes
id
love
another
and
another
and
another
overall
a
good
choice
in
the
pale
aleipa
category
not
the
greatest
brew
from
glbc
but
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
notes
smooth
drinking
pale
ale
almost
session
style
the
body
is
full
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
body
of
a
6
beer
easy
drinking
pale
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
bracing
and
slightly
astringent
nice
carbonation
levels
very
easy
drinker
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
well
done
apricot
colored
liquid
with
fine
columns
of
bubbles
rising
from
bottom
to
top
a
half
inch
cap
of
beige
foam
sits
atop
slowly
receding
but
leaving
no
lace
faint
aroma
of
biscuity
malts
and
sweet
fruits
some
fine
hops
coming
through
flavor
is
understated
very
subtle
malt
profile
is
very
low
and
decidely
lacking
hops
are
all
in
the
finish
very
citrusy
mostly
orange
peel
a
light
malt
and
pine
flavor
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
a
piney
tingle
hangs
in
the
back
of
the
throat
intertwines
flavor
nicesly
medium
mouhtyfell
and
drinkable
even
on
a
summer
day
nice
pale
ale
here
its
a
keeper
from
a
rather
large
taster
this
beer
is
a
orangey
concoction
with
yellow
outline
around
the
edge
like
a
cloud
of
flavor
immersed
in
a
lager
creamy
foam
rides
on
top
with
the
slightest
hint
of
lacing
in
the
glass
nutty
in
the
nose
and
bitter
with
hops
and
a
citrusey
orange
body
with
some
cinnamon
in
the
finish
roasted
malts
come
out
big
time
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
the
smokyflavored
hops
this
beer
was
mediumbodied
which
added
to
the
enjoyability
and
savour
but
allowed
the
drinkability
to
remain
high
as
a
kite
a
surprisingly
good
pale
ale
here
packed
with
flavor
and
benefitting
from
it
breaking
the
style
mold
here
pays
off
in
spades
and
leaves
me
with
the
memory
of
one
of
the
best
apa
ive
ever
encountered
would
have
ordered
another
if
the
grand
cru
wasnt
such
the
bomb
sht
drinkability
good
no
problems
here
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
touch
of
pink
hue
and
is
a
bit
darker
than
most
pale
ales
probably
closer
to
some
ipas
ive
had
head
and
lacing
are
decent
smells
like
citrus
fruit
lemon
with
some
sort
of
earthiness
that
is
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
taste
has
a
definite
citrus
twang
and
some
toasty
malts
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
pale
ales
but
its
actually
quite
balanced
mouthfeel
is
fine
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
a
little
middle
of
the
road
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
it
is
a
nice
change
from
the
malty
beers
i
tend
to
favor
when
youre
craving
something
a
bit
more
refreshing
that
will
go
down
easy
this
brew
will
be
just
fine
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
generous
frothy
light
tan
head
smell
is
cascades
all
the
way
very
appealing
some
caramel
malts
can
be
detected
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
initially
bitter
the
malt
backbone
is
there
definitely
caramel
flavors
maybe
some
toffee
the
hops
are
the
standout
of
this
brew
however
for
being
hopped
soley
by
cascades
this
one
has
a
nice
flavor
citrusy
mainly
grapefruit
and
lemon
but
not
overpowering
the
sweet
malts
balance
this
brew
well
mouthfeel
is
great
for
a
pale
ale
medium
body
but
not
too
thick
as
to
limit
the
drinkability
a
very
nice
pale
ale
definitely
in
my
top
tier
tasted
032905
this
beer
has
a
nice
clear
amber
appearance
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
seems
a
little
off
like
a
cheap
lager
but
with
hops
that
cover
up
most
of
the
bad
smell
theres
also
another
aroma
thats
like
fruitloops
cereal
pine
hop
flavor
but
balanced
this
beer
is
on
the
big
side
for
a
pale
ale
pretty
good
but
most
of
glbcs
beers
are
more
than
pretty
good
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
resulting
in
a
beer
thats
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
high
establishes
a
very
good
balance
very
much
ignored
in
many
of
the
pale
ale
style
me
likey
much
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
sharing
amber
with
a
decent
sized
light
tan
head
some
scattered
lacing
around
the
glass
as
the
head
stays
afloat
a
bit
of
citric
hops
jump
out
first
with
the
smell
before
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
comes
in
nice
balanced
smell
but
nothing
too
spectacular
citric
hop
bitterness
combines
with
a
caramel
sweetness
in
the
flavor
notes
of
biscuit
pine
and
earthy
hop
under
tones
could
be
noticed
slightly
bitter
after
taste
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
tad
rough
on
the
tongue
with
its
hops
solidly
drinkable
as
it
is
good
and
flavorfull
i
could
have
a
few
hazy
amber
color
with
fizzy
head
that
contains
lots
of
small
bubbles
heavy
flora
hop
aroma
even
from
a
distance
the
sent
of
cascade
hop
shines
through
medium
body
which
is
full
of
hop
starts
very
floral
then
moves
to
a
nice
bitterness
and
then
the
bitterness
slowly
fades
away

well
overall
hopped

taste

citric
hops
followed
by
a
candy
like
sweetness
regressing
to
a
lingering
bitter
resinous
finish
medium
body
and
slightly
slick
finish
great
session
beer
this
ale
cascades
from
the
bottle
a
hazy
reddish
orange
with
a
healthy
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
beautiful
hoppy
blend
of
citrous
fruits
and
flowers
married
to
a
clean
maltiness
up
front
the
hops
bite
sharply
the
initial
kick
is
smoothed
by
well
blended
malts
leading
to
a
finish
of
lemonlike
bitterness
and
the
slightlest
presence
of
alcohol
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
for
this
style
good
carbonation
adds
to
the
sharp
and
refreshing
hops
flavor
chalk
up
another
solid
brew
for
glbc
named
after
one
of
the
usas
most
embarrasing
environmental
events
when
the
cuyahoga
river
caught
on
fire
in
1969
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
apas
ive
sampled
it
pours
a
hazy
honey
amber
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
some
curtains

this

is
great
from

burning

is
most
worthy
of
being
in
these
good
brews
company
its
funny
how
how
you
cant
always
match
your
memoires
and
expectations
though
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
doesnt
go
over
the
top
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
me
thirst
for
more
great
lakes
is
a
brewer
that
never
disappoints
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
a
bready
flavor
which
i
believe
may
come
from
the
beer
being
slightly
old
the
hops
and
lively
carbonation
wash
away
this
notion
before
it
even
becomes
a
concern
quite
hoppy
for
an
apa
this
is
superbly
drinkable
stuff
an
ahhh
hits
the
spot
type
of
beer
bubbly
and
refreshing
on
the
tongue
without
ever
getting
dumbed
down
just
plain
solid
this
brew
has
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
with
a
cream
foam
head
that
leaves
behind
a
nice
lace
trail
it
has
a
bitter
hop
aroma
with
citrus
tones
along
for
the
ride
light
sweet
malts
up
front
punctuated
by
nice
bitter
hop
tones
bits
of
fruit
as
well
full
bodied
this
here
is
a
damn
good
pa
in
pittsburgh
visiting
the
parents
for
the
holidays
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
pick
up
some
great
lakes
which
i
cant
get
in
massachussetts
i
havent
had
these
since
maybe
high
school
and
i
am
rediscovering
their
greatness
appears
a
light
and
clear
orange
color
very
pale
and
bubbly
with
little
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
a
real
treat
strong
citrus
hop
scent
followed
by
any
fruit
you
care
to
conjure
up
while
youre
taking
your
whiff
pears
apircots
apples
grapefruit
the
whole
damn
fruit
basket
nice
fruity
malt
flavor
for
sure
enough
already
the
taste
is
also
strong
citrussy
bitter
hops
but
thats
not
the
entire
picture
as
in
some
beers
the
point
of
this
beer
wasnt
to
make
is
overly
hoppy
but
to
balance
that
flavor
with
a
ripe
sweetness
of
fruity
malts
grassy
too
great
complex
flavors
all
over
the
place
mouthfeel
is
excellent
almost
feelstastes
like
a
less
intense
barleywine
in
terms
of
thickness
and
syrupiness
great
smooth
and
sticky
juicy
feeling
a
real
treat
to
drink
im
gonna
miss
this
beer
when
i
head
back
east
drinkability
a
fine
ipa
for
some
serious
session
drinking
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
too
long
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
wheaty
and
yeasty
and
has
some
citrus
in
there
too
this
one
is
moderately
hoppy
up
front
but
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
back
to
it
has
a
floral
hop
flavor
finish
is
dry
but
nice
well
made
12
ounce
bottle
if
anything
the
hop
flavor
and
hop
aroma
could
be
more
prominent
to
make
this
beer
truly
shine
this
is
a
highly
companionable
beer
you
could
drink
any
day
or
any
time
of
year
special
thanks

stuff
a
judiciously
balanced
pale
ale

just
not
fond
of
the
finish
though
the
rest
is
wonderful
session
material
it
has
dropped
snpa
from
its
personal
place
as
best
all
around
pale
i
want
this
put
on
at
my
house
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
dry
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
almond
or
walnut
skin
with
a
very
smooth
ending
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
2
row
flavor
sits
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
and
worth
having
a
few
very
fruity
malty
flavor
peach
and
oranges
with
some
caramel
and
biscuits
big
hopness
here
tames
those
sweet
flavors
very
nicely
this
is
a
lot
larger
than
several
of
the
other
apas
ive
had
recently
and
is
very
tasty
i
enjoyed
this
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
copper
color
with
a
sweet
1
inch
head
a
nice
floral
citrusy
hops
aroma
fills
my
nose
and
beckons
me
to
take
that
first
sip
taste
has
a
wonderful
hops
presence
couple
with
a
great
biterness
a
damn
fine
example
of
a
apa
some
floral
piney
notes
come
through
as
well
this
is
a
awesome
brew
that
has
great
drinkability
its
up
there
with
snpa
in
my
book
two
thumbs
up
to
great
lakes
brewing
for
this
ale
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
of
their
other
offerings
as
well
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
nice
thick
head
of
small
white
bubbles
not
much
lacing
sweet
pine
grapefruit
cascade
hoppy
aroma
medium
body
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
great
hoppy
citrus
and
caramel
flavors
a
great
session
beer
very
easy
to
down
a
few
another
great
one
from
this
brewery
an
excellent
american
pale
ale
this
one
is
solid
and
satisfying
through
and
through
great
lakes
hasnt
disappointed
me
how
they
manage
to
brew
such
consistently
excellent
brews
are
beyond
me
many
of
their
brews
are
just
stupendous
and
leaders
in
the
style
and
this
is
no
exception
recommended
this
ale
is
very
well
balenced
perfect
amout
of
hops
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
i
commend
glbc
on
a
fantastic
job
pours
a
slightly
clouded
golden
orange
color
with
a
good
thick
light
beige
head
lots
of
tealike
malt
tannins
and
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
flowery
esters
in
the
nose
sweetened
tea
is
most
dominant
in
the
malt
and
the
hops
take
the
background
but
not
too
far
back
carbonation
is
good
which
keeps
it
light
and
drinkable
pretty
much
what
im
looking
for
in
an
apa
quaffable
yet
having
some
character
in
the
sense
that
the
citrusiness
of
the
hops
meld
nicely
with
the
malt
ng
wyll
clear
copperamber
color
with
gold
highlights
disappointingly
little
head
even
after
an
aggressive
pour
a
rather
assertive
nose
highlighted
by
citrus
hops
and
biscuity
sweetness
taste
is
complex
and
balanced
with
a
nicel
citrusy
crush
of
hops
that
endures
malty
sweetness
shows
up
it
the
middle
and
fades
to
a
smooth
finish
nice
mouthfeel
in
this
one
with
a
pleasant
combination
of
smoothness
and
just
enough
clingy
hopes
to
keep
things
interesting
this
fine
ale
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
brown
with
a
rather
small
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
but
nothing
too
spectacular
it
tastes
of
hops
and
leaves
a
refreshing
bitterness
all
in
all
a
very
solid
pale
ale
definitely
the
best
i
have
sampled
from
the
great
state
of
ohio
someday
im
gonna
have
to
admit
to
myself
that
this
is
probably
my
favorite
style
its
always
so
satisfying
this
one
works
for
me
thanks
to
oldcrustacean
for
the
bottle
a
solid
and
drinkable
beer
a
mainstay
type
sampled
on
tap
at
the
brewery
this
one
was
a
light
goldenorangish
with
minimal
head
as
it
was
filled
to
the
brim
having
just
walked
to
the
brewery
i
was
hoping
for
a
somewhat
easydrinking
thirstquencher
to
start
off
the
evening
i
got
that
more
as
this
one
was
not
only
perfectly
crafted
supremely
drinkable
but
also
very
well
hopped
aroma
of
floral
woody
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
toasty
malts
flavor
follows
the
nose
as
this
one
is
a
tremendously
well
balanced
mix
of
toasted
malts
muted
but
delectable
floral
mildly
citrusy
hops
medium
bodied
very
clean
well
rounded
brew
that
departs
with
a
lasting
dry
bitterness
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
just
an
expertly
crafted
pale
ale
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
lacing
is
immense
leaving
a
ring
with
every
drink
smell
is
hoppy
and
floral
with
a
slight
citrus
tinge
taste
is
good
a
decent
amount
of
hops
in
front
with
a
slight
malt
backround
mouthfeel
is
sticky
alittle
too
much
but
still
a
great
drinkin
ale
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
this
apa
pretty
damn
good
final
thought
this
is
a
great
apa
and
cant
wait
to
buy
a
keg
of
this
stuff
in
the
longrun
great
everyday
beer
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
a
nice
pale
ale
that
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
ale
is
amber
in
color
and
has
a
nice
foamy
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
with
a
biscuit
aroma
the
taste
is
amazing
i
really
enjoy
the
matching
of
the
hops
with
the
malts
this
is
a
very
complex
pale
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
great
but
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
with
a
little
less
carbonation
drinkablility
is
exceptional
taste
is
wellbalanced
and
smooth
hops
are
the
backbone
but
not
all
that
bitter
a
very
likeable
brew
that
is
extremely
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
that
id
love
to
be
able
to
get
down
here
in
nc
pours
with
a
large
golden
tinted
head
3
fingers
tall
light
copper
color
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
is
very
noticable
fruity
and
floral
the
taste
is
what
an
apa
should
taste
like
citrusy
but
not
overpouring
bitter
but
not
blegh
bitter
crisp
just
a
touch
of
the
hop
aftertaste
left
behind
the
mouthfeel
is
not
thick
not
thin
like
water
leaves
a
thin
film
in
the
mouth
this
beer
goes
down
fast
i
had
two
down
very
fast
pours
an
amber
color
with
nice
white
head
and
great
lacing
seen
smells
of
citrusy
hops
and
nice
grassy
notes
too
taste
is
very
smooth
starts
kinda
slow
but
works
into
a
nice
bitterness
and
citrus
hops
flavors
malts
are
well
represented
in
this
brew
however
as
the
beer
is
very
nicely
rounded
out
flavorwise
nice
lingering
bitterness
that
works
very
well
for
this
brew
medium
bodied
with
moderate
ammount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
brew
solid
all
around
offering
again
from
great
lakes
definitly
worth
a
try
or
two
a
superior
pale
ale
a
nice
pale
ale
with
a
floral
and
fruity
hop
aroma
the
appearance
was
a
nice
amber
gold
with
a
good
head
on
it
the
taste
was
a
good
floral
and
fruity
hoppy
to
match
the
aroma
this
seemed
like
a
particularly
heavy
pale
and
gave
it
a
sticky
mouthfeel
that
took
away
from
the
drinkability
overall
id
recommend
this
pale
to
anybody
who
likes
a
good
pale
this
beer
was
a
golden
amber
color
a
heavy
pour
generated
a
frothy
white
head
the
nose
was
subtle
of
hops
with
some
fruit
notes
as
well
liek
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
subtle
with
hops
and
had
a
smooth
mouthfeel
not
much
of
an
after
taste
and
was
a
nice
beer
i
appreciated
the
label
very
much
the
body
is
a
metallic
amber
with
a
nice
yellowishwhite
head
that
builds
easily
and
lingers
for
a
bit
the
aroma
is
moderately
hoppy
and
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bit
of
caramel
to
supposed
the
bitterness
theres
just
something
about
it
that
strikes
me
wrong
its
not
bad
but
ive
had
apas
that
i
much
prefer
to
this
one
one
of
the
few
beers
by
great
lakes
that
i
dont
like
for
the
style
really
tasty
drinkable
apa
and
at
4
99
a
six
pack
at
my
local
beer
store
really
cant
be
beat
i
think
it
might
be
a
mistake
but
im
going
to
tell
them
nice
hoppy
nose
that
is
probably
cascades
a
fairly
smooth
taste
with
nice
malt
undertones
the
beers
quite
bitter
but
flavorful
as
well
nice
cascade
hop
flavor
very
drinkable
i
like
it
drinkability
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
like
hops
but
i
also
like
other
characteristics
as
well
this
beer
is
superb
its
elegant
and
graceful
enough
to
be
paired
with
the
fanciest
foods
or
a
trusty
sidekick
while
playing
cards
with
pretzels
and
peanuts
one
of
the
top
5
pale
ales
brewed
in
the
us
period
had
the
pleasure
last
october
to
enjoy
this
and
several
other
great
lakes
offerings
splendid
craft
brews
these
guys
really
know
what
theyre
doing
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
head
and
nice
chunky
lacing
hoppy
with
a
trace
of
an
orange
scent
pleasingly
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
citrus
malts
have
the
a
say
in
the
matter
but
the
hops
definatly
get
the
last
word
slightly
sharp
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bit
of
a
pucker
to
it
but
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
after
a
lazy
saturday
afternoon
in
front
of
the
baseball
game
nice
amber
color
with
a
dense
foamy
head
there
was
a
very
fine
sediment
throughout
the
entire
glass
but
it
did
not
settle
to
the
bottom
it
just
hung
motionless
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
wonderful
crisp
hop
flavor
this
is
bar
none
a
wonderful
pale
ale
but
i
still
have
my
top
ten
pales
and
this
one
would
probably
be
edged
out
a
6abv
this
one
could
be
ahad
in
fairly
quick
succession
and
if
id
only
had
more
than
one
and
seperate
cheers
to
tavernjef
for
sneaking
it
across
the
wi
border
for
me
dn
another
awesome
offering
from
great
lakes
brewing
co
tasty
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
beer
to
try
out
to
make
this
perfect
a
bit
more
citrus
than
fruitiness
would
be
nice
but
i
wouldnt
change
this
too
much
copperyhoney
gold
hue
with
a
slight
haziness
the
vaguely
offwhite
head
reached
almost
two
fingers
in
height
the
retention
was
very
good
it
slowly
faded
to
a
long
lasting
cap
however
the
lacing
was
a
little
spotty
but
still
this
is
a
lovely
looking
beer
juicy
citrus
aromas
charge
ahead
of
the
toastybiscuit
maltiness
there
is
also
an
occasional
hint
of
floral
as
a
whole
the
bouquet
is
very
inviting
it
smells
like
a
pale
ale
should
good
potency
as
well
the
palate
is
tremendously
tasty
with
a
big
bite
of
hoppy
bitterness
juicy
as
well
i
am
impressed
with
the
potency
of
the
hops
why
can
more
breweries
make
ipas
this
good
it
is
true
the
hops
steal
the
show
and
it
is
unbalanced
in
a
blissful
way
but
it
must
be
noted
that
the
maltiness
is
detectable
a
little
bit
of
toasty
crackers
and
a
hint
of
a
caramel
too
but
seriously
this
is
a
nicely
hoppy
pale
ale
yummy
it
would
be
a
stretch
to
say
this
is
a
complex
beer
but
how
many
of
this
style
are
the
slight
burn
of
the
alcohol
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
is
charming
the
mouthfeel
is
very
sturdy
this
might
be
the
most
impressive
attribute
of
all
the
glbc
beers
ive
had
mediummediumfull
in
body
natural
modest
carbonation
appetizing
aftertaste
it
is
making
me
yearn
for
a
good
cookout
burning
river
is
tremendously
drinkable
this
is
a
topnotch
pale
ale
easily
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
i
wish
i
had
more
thank
you
phantomvodoo
taste
is
soft
and
well
rounded
yet
solid
in
body
and
feel
to
keep
that
charge
of
character
going
strong
and
this
is
characterized
in
a
gratifying
presence
of
both
a
super
nice
toasty
warm
malt
profile
and
pleasantly
soft
and
milding
hop
balance
that
brings
in
refined
and
subtle
layers
of
wood
and
dulled
floral
citrus
quite
yummy
scratch
that
very
yummy
feel
is
dead
on
for
a
pale
clean
soft
full
well
rounded
yielding

warmth
smooth
bite
of
bitterness
and
quaffable
to
the
fullest
one
hell
of
a
pale
imho
better
than
many
other
american
pale
ales
but
still
a
little
over
the
top
with
the
hops
a
decent
balance
of
flavors
nice
lightcopper
color
with
a
white
head
smells
of
sweet
toasted
malt
bread
and
citrus
hops
great
taste
of
citrus
combined
with
a
sweet
malt
preety
good
mouthfeel
not
to
thin
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
that
is
very
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
lucky
for
me
this
is
usually
available
in
the
area
so
this
is
a
good
old
reliable
this
is
one
beer
that
has
never
let
me
down
a
21
gun
salute
to
bighuge
for
this
battleship
of
a
pale
ale
this
clear
golden
ale
wears
a
medium
sized
offwhtie
head
fully
diminishing
unfortunately
aroma
is
not
so
pronounced
i
expected
a
big
cascade
predominance
we
rather
face
a
complex
hop
blend
that
id
describe
as
earthy
oily
spicy
and
bold
as
it
enters
the
mouth
its
a
delight
of
ever
evolving
character
a
good
chunk
of
malt
is
always
there
literally
dancing
with
the
complex
hops
blend
as
described
above
in
a
perfect
balance
and
harmony
the
medium
body
never
fails
to
support
those
intense
sweet
toasty
cerealic
citrus
flavors
medium
carbonation
overall
theres
just
something
about
this
american
pale
ale
that
makes
me
feel
like
its
the
best
ive
ever
taken
i
know
youve
had
that
feeling
about
some
beers
too
big
props
to
ciderguy
for
this
unique
opportunity
comments
thanks
are
in
order
to
chilidog
for
sending
this
great
brew
my
way
during
this
years
holiday
exchange
if
i
could
only
get
more
of
this
great
tasting
beer
around
my
area
all
would
be
right
with
the
world
what
an
extrordinary
brew
wish
this
was
available
here
in
nj
as
it
would
have
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
a
couple
of
thoughts
glbc
seems
to
be
incapable
of
brewing
anything
but
outstanding
beer
across
a
wide
range
of
styles
after
sampling
three
of
their
offerings
im
convinced
that
they
have
absolutely
nailed
down
headlace
and
carbonationmouthfeel
lastly
this
bottle
had
a
best
by
date
of
sept

a
full
3
months
before
i
purchased
it
and
3
months
before
this

i
detected
no
problems
whatsoever
this
bottle
has
an
expiration
date
of
jan

that

bit

a
great
summer
beer
i
have
never
had
a
bad
brew
from
this
brewery
this
is
the
rerating
after
not
having
for
2
5
years
initial
taste
of
carbonation
with
hop
surge
subtle
malt
presence
but
hops
dominates
the
palate
crisp
finish
to
a
extremely
drinkable
brew
one
is
simply
not
enough
some
nice
sweet
caramel
up
front
followed
by
big
orangey
hop
flavours
straight
forward
well
done
soft
on
the
palate
with
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
great
lakes
puts
out
some
great
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
cant
believe
ive
had
this
treasure
in
my
minifridge
for
so
long
and
just
now
got
around
to
sampling
it
ill
have
to
see
how
it
tastes
after
3
or
4
strong
floral
hop
presence
dominated
by
cascades
but
i
am
sure
their
are
other
hop
varieties
present
wonderful
biscuit
malt
background
highlights
this
excellently
constructed
beer
great
for
a
session
truly
the
premier
example
of
the
style
of
the
american
pale
ale
color
is
a
copper
orange
with
a
medium
frothy
head
nice
lace
ever
so
slight
haze
smell
is
citrus
hop
with
a
good
malt
presence
very
good
taste
hoppy
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
this
one
has
some
citrus
cascade
perhaps
nice
malt
and
hop
finish
good
mouthfeel
not
to
thick
clean
and
crisp
drinkability
is
better
than
average
not
one
that
can
be
glugged
on
a
hot
day
but
one
to
drink
while
playing
cards
or
watching
football
on
the
tube
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
this
one
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
frothy
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
the
flavor
shows
a
lot
of
strong
hoppiness
to
this
beer
its
upfront
flavor
is
a
citrusy
hoppiness
that
has
a
bite
to
it
but
it
soon
gets
a
little
restrained
by
the
biscuity
malt
base
that
keeps
this
one
from
being
an
ipa
and
also
gives
it
that
added
dimension
that
makes
this
such
a
good
beer
the
hops
show
throughout
the
body
and
finish
of
the
beer
finish
also
has
some
yeasty
spicyness
that
combines
well
with
the
hops
a
very
good
beer
has
a
big
grapefruity
smell
and
taste
almost
like
a
wheat
beer
the
hoppy
taste
sublty
changes
as
my
cup
warms
up
to
a
more
bitter
aspect
like
an
ipa
excellent
appearance
and
head
for
this
style
i
sampled
this
at
a
homebrew
party
among
a
sea
of
oktoberfest
beers
so
this
is
a
refreshing
and
welcome
change
of
pace
2
i
swear
this
used
to
be
labeled
ipa
and
not
simply
pale
ale
did
this
change
about
the
time
commodore
perry
ipa
was
introduced
just
wondering
i
wonder
if
that
peculiarly
american
phenomenon
of
hop
infaltion
is
at
work

pale

that
i

is

on

shiredavejul

with
more
emphasis
on
the
hops
this
pale
ales
taste
is
quite
solid
and
fresh
its
wellbalanced
with
a
strong
hop
presence
followed
up
with
what
must
be
caramel
malt
holding
everything
into
place
feel
is
quite
smooth
overall
but
is
listed
as
a
pale
of
course
this
isnt
as
hoppy
as
a
ruination
or
a
twohearted
as
it
erodes
the
obviation

this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
yet
distinct
im
not
the
greatest
at
putting
words
to
flavors
so
i
will
just
say
that
i
wouldnt
change
this
beer
in
any
way
for
years
it
has
been
my
favorite
pale
ale
it
is
also
very
affordable
at
6
99
per
six
pack
and
26
dollars
after
my
case
discount
i
have
always
thought
its
the
best

for
the
money

one
of
my
favorite
beers
at
russian
river
i
usually
take
advantage
and
drink
row
2
over
pliny
or
blind
pig
or
even
some
of
the
sours
because
its
not
bottled
top
notch
pale
ale
that
can
compete
with
any
other
beers
in
its
style
category
just
right
with
hoppiness
and
abv
had
it
on
tap
at
the
russian
river
bar
area
ask
for
a
sample
if
unsure
o
simcoe
hop
bliss
had
on
draft
two
successive
days
on
a
visit
to
ca
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
didnt
know
the
abv
and
guessed
that
it
was
around
7
not
because
you
could
taste
alcohol
but
because
there
was
so
much
flavor
hop
forward
with
plenty
of
citrus
missing
some
of
the
pineyness
that
i
expect
from
west
coast
ales
and
substituting
tropical
and
earth
notes
riding
a
sufficient
and
perfectly
complimentary
malt
backbone
i
find
single
hop
beers
to
have
more
personality
than
usual
and
not
always
in
a
good
way
but
here
rr
nails
it
ive
almost
stopped
drinking
pale
ales
because
they
are
less
interesting
to
me
than
ipas
but
this
is
one
i
sorely
wish
was
available
locally
the
best
apa
i
have
ever
had
i
had
it
at
the
brewery
but
i
hope
they
bottle
this
again
so
i
have
a
chance
of
getting
this
out
in
colorado
perhaps
one
of
the
finer
american
pales
happening
right
now
i
can
recall
very
few
that
do
what
this
one
does
which
is
showcase
a
hop
varietal
brilliantly
without
being
filling
boozy
or
tiring
this
is
so
clean
and
light
on
the
palate
golden
in
color
and
frothy
to
the
feel
the
hops
are
simcoe
i
think
but
its
such
a
delicate
usage
not
delicate
in
flavor
they
are
dripping
resins
and
citrus
notes
but
they
never
get
heavy
or
bitter
like
they
sometimes
do
in
other
beers
quite
often
really
i
never
miss
the
bitterness
here
and
i
dont
wish
for
a
more
complex
grain
bill
i
think
its
straightforward
nature
is
impressive
not
trying
to
cover
flaws
with
tons
of
esoteric
grains
or
anything
its
just
perfectly
made
beer
there
are
a
few
pales
i
like
as
much
but
not
one
i
can
think
that
i
really
like
better
or
would
prefer
to
have
a
steady
stream
of
this
is
top
tier
fantastic
speciality
pale
made
with
specific
hops
from
a
local
grower
great
color
head
and
carbonation
pine
on
the
nose
and
bitey
hop
with
resiney
dry
out
on
the
mouth
a
must
have
overall
its
no
pliny
but
good
none
the
less
single
hop
beers
are
great
for
getting
to
know
the
hops
but
im
always
reminded
drinking
them
how
boring
they
become
without
others
to
mix
up
the
flavor
this
is
one
pleasing
pale
ale
which
is
good
for
everyday
drinking
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
one
i
cant
help
but
think
of
row
2
as
a
more
hop
forward
single
ipa
version
of
pliny
the
drinkability
factor
is
off
the
charts
the
ibus
and
the
tropical
juiciness
continue
to
shine
with
each
pour
row
2
is
a
sensational
ipa
that
comes
highly
recommended
mad
skillz
part
of
a
sampler
at
the
brewery
this
one
poured
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
small
white
head
not
much
aroma
which
was
unexpected
smell
of
light
pine
and
a
hint
of
citrus
peel
backed
by
some
very
lightly
sweet
malts
simcoe
grapefruit
flavor
dominates
alongside
some
piney
medium
bitter
on
the
tongue
resinous
yet
dry
finishing
pine
medium
plus
carbonation
and
super
easy
drinking
a
really
nice
beer
but
one
that
i
was
expecting
more
from
i
will
have
to
try
and
revisit
this
one
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
out
there
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
personally
had
to
go
to
the
brewery
to
find
it
overall
this
has
replaced
hop
trip
as
my
favorite
pale
ale
really
glad
it
is
getting
bottled
soon
this
is
a
truly
sippable
rather
than
gulpable
pale
ale
i
was
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
and
its
great
to
taste
a
less
intense
yet
pleasurable
beer
than
their
usual
overhopped
ipas
mouthfeeloverall
lightmedium
body
with
lowish
carbonation
mouthfeel
seems
about
right
maybe
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
for
me
drinks
about
to
its
abv
overall
a
really
nice
pale
ale
that
i
would
have
again
good
one
this
really
pushes
ipa
and
surely
is
a
russian
river
beer
with
huge
amount
of
hops
it
really
has
tons
of
flavor
at
this
abv
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
it
showcases
the
simcoe
hops
extremely
well
in
a
fullbodied
incredibly
drinkable
apa
its
like
how
zombie
dust
showcases
the
citra
hops
so
well
vinnie
really
should
bottle
more
of
this
beer

then
again
it
is

pale
and
not

feel

othis
is
the
beer
that
sets

bench
mark
for

never
in

had
a
beer
so
savory
i
can

this

timeall

new
benchmark
after
the
sampler
set
at

i
was

up

simcoe
is

table
great

balance
as

would

try
this
an
exceptional
apa
grassy
and
fresh
bright
citrus
flavors
orange
peel
lemon
nice
malt
balance
juicy
100
simcoe
true
class
id
likely
pick
this
over
blind
pig
any
day
of
the
week
wish
i
had
access
do
this
pale
ale
is
enjoyable
for
the
balance
it
displays
despite
also
featuring
focusedif
a
little
simplistichops
qualities
sidebyside
it
matches
the
look
of
russian
rivers
pliny
the
elder
immediately
after
pouring
although
that
other
beer
coats
the
glass
better
although
the
aroma
is
shy
and
tends
to
hide
the
flavor
stands
up
to
expectations
overall
an
excellent
hoppy
pale
my
glass
was
empty
very
quickly
if
drinkability
was
still
a
score
here
this
would
get
a
5
very
refreshing
oa
flavorful
yet
easy
to
drink
brew
that
is
really
well
done
yep
odone
of
the
best
apas
i
have
had
right
there
with
blind
pig
and
within
shouting
distance
of
pliny
the
elder
they
all
have
similar
flavor
aspects
in
conclusion
i
could
drink
this
forever
and
would
never
lose
my
shiteating
grin
overall
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
if
you
love
hops
this
ones
for
you
if
i
could
use
one
word
to
describe
this
brew
i
would
say
balanced
nothing
overpowers
your
nose
or
mouth
and
this
beer
begs
you
to
take
another
sip
great
job
russian
river
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
a
big
hoppy
pale
featuring
simcoe
hops
light
orange

and
lace
sheet
very
good
drinkability
well
malted
providing
above
average
mouthfeel
bang
on
the
style
juicy
orange
citrus
best
beer
of
the
night
and
of
the
newest
rr
on
tap
not
as
well
balanced
as
the
other
russian
river
beers
sampled
last
night
but
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
buy
a
second
pint
and
am
disappointed
that
bottles
werent
available
on
tap
pour
is
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
creamy
white
head
nose
is
tight
with
light
malt
caramel
and
some
nice
grainy
malt
good
hop
profile
notes
of

and
strong
herbal
presence
taste
is
balanced
dry
finish
tight
balance
grain
and
faint
sweet
caramel
with
citrus
and
herbal
hops
o
great
beer
overall
well
put
together
and
a
really
interesting
hop
flavor
once
it
warms
a
bit
mroe
it
has
more
smell
d
a
little
too
pissy
for
my
taste
but
not
a
bad
beer
t
a
great
blend
of
citrus
hops
grapefruit
orange
lemon
and
a
touch
of
pine
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
some
notes
of
caramel
and
cracker
hold
the
beer
up
nicely
really
good
stuff
pours
a
light
to
mid
orange
with
with
a
monstrous
white
head
great
lacing
throughout
really
hop
sticky
aroma
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
dank
pine
and
some
earthy
qualities
nice
light
but
hop
showcasing
flavor
profile
very
nice
citrus
notes
to
start
orange
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
tropical
notes
a
sticky
fresh
and
earthy
pine
hop
follows
that
adds
a
bit
of
bittering
on
the
tongue
finishes
very
light
and
dry
much
like
the
flavor
profile
this
is
a
awesomely
single
hopped
pale
ale
o
one
of
my
favorites
apas
and
is
more
true
to
the
style
up
there
with
zombie
dust
and
such
although
i
feel
its
a
stretch
to
call
zd
an
apa
but
thats
another
discussion
big
time
flavor
on
a
microscopic
abved
beer
highly
drinkable
another
winner
from
russian
river
thanks
kawilliams82
flavor
snaps
with
a
clear
citrus
squeeze
and
some
light
bitterness
this
goes
down
all
too
easily
definitely
one
ill
have
again
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bilbosnuts
for
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
coast
willi
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
slight
orange
hue
with
a
two
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
grapefruit
grapefruit
hop
fruit
and
very
subtle
pine
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tropical
fruit
citrus
citrus
hop
grapefruit
hop
fruit
and
subtle
grapefruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
was
really
intrigued
by
this
one
upon
seeing
its
release
from
the
brewery
i
know
rr
is
good
at
making
ipaiipas
so
i
wanted
to
see
what
they
could
do
with
an
apa
i
can
honestly
say
that
they
did
quite
a
nice
job
on
this
one
the
simcoe
is
a
very
nice
hop
and
this
brew
definitely
showcases
this
fact
throughout
each
sip
and
especially
in
the
aroma
this
brew
also
brings
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
aroma
with
it
as
well
to
keep
your
palate
intrigued
throughout
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
but
not
quite
up
to
zombie
dust
standards
as
i
would
have
loved
to
find
o
a
great
pale
ale
excellent
showcase
of
the
simcoe
hop
medium
bodied
with
tight
carbonation
and
a
spicy
floral
hop
bite
up
front
that
provide
some
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
throughout
this
is
countered
midpalate
by
pale
malt
subtle
citrus
and
some
light
fruit
bitter
but
not
too
much
so
with
the
perfect
amount
of
dryness
thats
countered
by
bready
yeast
biscuit
and
pale
malt
im
also
picking
up
hints
of
straw
apple
and
pear
well
balanced
with
great
hop
flavor
making
this
beer
very
quaffable
fuckin
eh
another
homerun
for
russian
river
o
having
drank
5
or
6
growlers
of
this
i
think
im
prepared
to
say
i
like
this
beer
however
its
a
poster
child
for
craft
beer
inflation
its
6
bottle
asking
price
at
my
local
shop
is
simply
too
much
for
an
apa
i
think
russian
river
also
found
this
out
the
hard
way
as
they
distributed
more
to
local
stores
after
it
apparently
didnt
sell
out
at
the
pub
ill
drink
the
shit
out
of
this
in
growler
form
though
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
wow
love
it
o
nice
pale
thats
not
overpowered
by
the
spicy
hops
which
is
good
by
me
bottle
date
is
626
this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
unpolished
gold
in
clor
with
a
very
soapy
two
finger
head
the
nose
is
fresh
and
like
sticking
your
face
in
a
bucket
of
smcoe
its
light
and
floral
and
the
malt
certainly
takes
a
backseat
i
do
appreciate
how
pale
the
malt
is
allowing
the
hops
to
shine
the
flavors
too
are
hoppy
clean
and
floral
there
is
also
a
perfumey
essence
i
love
how
straightforward
it
is
simcoe
isnt
my
favorite
hop
varietal
but
that
doesnt
phase
me
from
cherishing
this
beer
it
would
be
fun
to
see
what
other
hop
varietals
could
do
with
this
recipe
it
drinks
light
and
is
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
i
would
place
it
behind
zombie
dust
and
the
hill
farmsteads
but
that
already
puts
it
in
an
elite
class
bottle
just
an
outstanding
pale
ale
venturing
into
ipa
territory
but
retaining
a
nice
light
drinkability
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
citrus
hops
being
at
the
forefront
light
sweet
malt
presence
it
not
smack
you
in
the
face
hopy
like
russian
river
typically
does
but
instead
is
a
well
rounded
apa
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
taster
glass
a
good
1
of
thin
white
head
sits
on
top
of
a
light
yellow
body
the
aroma
is
huge
grapefruit
not
like
this
surprises
me
aroma
on
russian
river
beers
always
seem
to
smack
you
in
the
face
taste
is
nice
and
clean
great
balance
im
not
to
sure
if
i
can
recall
another
single
hopped
pale
ale
but
i
know
that
from
now
on
this
will
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
when
anybody
asks
me
if
id
had
one
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
super
sessionable
o
this
is
one
helluva
apa
so
much
flavor
for
the
lowish
abv
as
good
or
better
than
zombie
dust
wow
just
had
another
liked
it
even
better
this
time
o
this
was
a
very
good
apa
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
might
even
say
i
prefer
drinking
it
over
zombie
dust
i
liked
how
it
a
nice
light
lemony
citrus
hop
taste
to
it
definitely
a
nice
summer
beer
i
recommend
any
apa
fan
to
try
this
o
the
aromas
alone
are
worth
getting
the
bottle
id
like
to
see
more
flavor
but
i
liked
it
500ml
bottle
dated
626
so
this
was
three
weeks
old
when
i
drank
it
perfect
thanks
to
bugdoc
for
sending
this
to
me
appreciate
it
man
orange
yellow
appearance
good
head
and
lacing
smells
like
simcoes
hints
of
cat
pee
delicious
mouthfeel
is
thick
flavor
is
delicious
simcoes
with
a
good
maltiness
this
is
a
great
hoppy
pale
ale
but
not
something
i
would
probably
drink
a
whole
sixer
not
that
i
could
ever
get
one
because
it
was
a
little
chewy
very
glad
to
have
had
a
shot
at
this
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
ive
drank
a
little
more
than
a
gallon
of
this
stuff
the
past
week
between
having
it
on
tap
getting
a
growler
of
it
and
about
a
dozen
bottles
and
the
coolest
part
about
it
is
how
sometimes
the
pineapple
is
just
nuts
those
are
my
favorite
bottles
o
its
a
really
awesome
beer
except
that
the
flavor
is
just
boring
nothing
to
wow
you
or
keep
your
attention
its
very
drinkable
though
o
definite
similarities
to
snpa
in
flavour
and
mouthfeel
a
very
good
product
russian
river
always
puts
out
great
hoppy
beers
a
pour
produces
a
112
finger
white
head
resting
of
a
pale
golden
body
good
retention
and
lacing
4
5
a
overall
simcoe
may
not
be
everyones
favorite
hop
but
this
is
well
done
for
what
the
hop
delivers
o
this
beer
highlights
the
hops
quite
well
but
its
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
light
of
russian
rivers
other
offerings
b
overall
a
superb
pale
ale
more
please
o
this
beer
is
at
the
top
of
its
class
even
beating
so
called
ipas
on
the
shelf
really
well
balanced
and
great
hop
forward
pale
ale
i
expected
nothing
less
from
rr
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
tall
white
head
nice
fresh
citrus
hoppiness
tons
of
grapefruit
lots
of
tangerine
as
well
pine
and
a
hint
of
grass
with
sweet
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
but
good
pine
and
grapefruit
a
little
bit
of
floral
hop
character
as
well
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
overall
that
being
said
id
still
give
it
another
go
picked
up
a
couple
fresh
specimens
this
afternoon
first
time
with
this
brew
poured
into
my
tulip
the
brew
is
a
pleasant
pale
copper
with
a
nice
inch
thick
cap
of
foam
that
reveals
nice
lacing
as
i
drink
down
the
nose
is
fragrant
with
bright
citrus
sticky
resiny
pine
all
things
simcoe
flavors
falls
right
in
line
with
red
grapefruit
bitter
lemon
peel
and
bitter
pine
sap
on
a
crisp
dry
mouth
that
leaves
behind
a
very
pleasant
unique
biting
orange
peel
note
a
delicious
apa
much
needed
here
on
the
west
coast
in
a
sea
of
sameness
with
this
style
beer
very
drinkable
and
almost
sessionable
at
5
8
abv
its
not
zombie
dust
but
its
a
serious
apa
for
all
of
you
that
seek
out
quality
in
this
style
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
apa
and
another
great
hoppy
beer
from
russian
river
the
nose
is
super
hoppy
and
full
of
citruus
and
pine
and
the
taste
is
great
too
glad
to
see
them
bottling
this
one
will
love
to
have
it
again
drink
call
it
an
apa
its
fine
ill
stick
with
a
small
ipa
all
day
long
id
like
another
bottle
on
a
hot
day
but
wont
go
crazy
trying
to
find
one
very
easy
to
drink
very
flavorful
and
never
overpowering
light
malt
lets
the
simcoe
shine
oa
wonderful
refreshing
and
most
of
all
balanced
beer
rr
really
knows
how
to
craft
balanced
hoppy
brews
o
overall
excellent
big
citrus
and
pine
although
not
as
profound
as
say
an
ipa
or
iipa
but
the
citrus
and
pine
are
profound
above
anything
else
delicious
and
sessionable
a
real
winner
here
the
beer
is
very
nice
a
great
summer
drinker
i
wish
i
could
just
session
all
day
o
this
is
a
very
good
hoppy
apa
and
i
feel
like
im
being
a
little
picky
on
the
flavor
profile
still
it
doesnt
quite
rise
to
the
worldclass
category
in
my
opinion
i
would
certainly
drink
some
more
however
o
quite
tasty
offering
and
cant
wait
for
the
next
in
the
series
o
a
great
hoppy
apa
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
i
hope
russian
river
continues
to
produce
this
ale
as
i
will
definitely
buy
more
cheers
overall
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
another
tasty
offering
from
an
outstanding
brewery
one
finger
pure
white
head
small
bubbles
over
medium
gold
clear
body
multiple
streams
of
rising
carbonation
nose
is
a
combination
of
fruitiness
grapefruit
pith
clean
nonassertive
malt
with
a
bit
of
pine
resin
taste
mirrors
nose
more
fruity
than
malty
until
the
pine
notes
set
in
on
the
back
end
increasingly
so
as
it
warmed
mouthfeel
on
the
light
side
of
medium
good
effervescence
a
real
revelation
re
single
hop
apa
glad
i
got
the
last
glass
before
the
keg
blew
one
of
the
hoppier
apas
ive
had
and
one
of
the
best
tastewise
definitely
worth
a
try
ok
ok
russian
river
i
give
up
how
did
you
perform
this
magic
trick
with
simcoe
this
is
gorgeous
stuff
like
no
simcoe
ive
ever
had
beforeto
me
simcoe
was
flabbily
and
lazily
hoppy
giving
citrus
and
oily
pine
with
residual
sweetness
that
always
detracted
from
the
beer
this
is
fragrant
juicy
tight
and
delicious
im
just
going
to
put
it
down
to
your
skill
overall
4
0
a
fine
showcase
for
simcoe
in
an
extremely
sessionable
pale
ale
really
seems
more
like
a
diet
ipa
with
all
that
fruit
and
pine
the
aroma
is
killer
and
the
taste
follows
suit
but
i
feel
that
the
slightly
watery
texture
loses
some
points
for
this
beer
which
is
still
a
great
product
overall
well
done
vin
and
crew
you
hit
this
outta
the
park
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
that
shows
off
simcoe
no
flair
needed
here
it
does
lack
the
hop
complexity
that
blind
pig
and
pliny
have
but
it
is
refined
and
delicious
in
its
own
way
very
drinkable
as
well
russian
river
takes
seemingly
their
favorite
hop
varietal
simcoe
and
formulated
a
pale
ale
to
showcase
its
very
robust
aromas
and
flavors
what
row
2hill
56
turned
out
to
be
is
a
fantastically
hoppy
pale
that
has
a
malthop
ratio
that
isnt
all
that
dissimilar
to
their
legendary
pliny
the
elder
very
crisp
and
amazing
pale
ale
that
really
allows
the
simcoe
hop
to
shine
o
another
amazing
hoppy
beer
from
rr
who
continues
to
produce
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
country
i
would
drink
this
all
dayevery
day
along
some
of
the
top
apas
out
there
edward
parking
violation
hoppy
birthday
and
what
is
enlightenment
to
name
a
few
feel
is
at
about
light
and
really
easy
drinking
here
a
pint
is
easy
and
the
2nd
if
i
got
one
would
of
been
easier
to
drink
a
nice
pale
ale
with
flavor
that
wont
hit
you
over
the
head
o
very
excellent
brew
for
sure
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
hugging
the
line
between
a
hoppy
apa
and
an
ipa
is
a
beautiful
place
the
lighter
abv
and
body
are
a
welcome
treat
i
realize
at
5
8
this
isnt
a
traditional
session
beer
but
man
its
close
i
am
hoping
that
other
brewers
realize
this
is
a
great
space
and
continue
to
produce
beers
like
this
kudos

foam
and
brilliant
clarity
smells
of
tropical
fruits
pineapple
most
notably
with
grapefruit
and
mango
in
there
as
well
fantastic
nose
taste
follows
suit
with
a
really
citrusy
fruity
flavor
and
lighter
biscuity
malts
fantastic
flavor
i
can
only
imagine
would
be
even
greater
a
week
earlier
medium
bodied
with
lively
carb
and
a
wet
finish
man
this
is
a
great
beer
i
hope
they
bottle
it
as
ive
heard
might
be
in
the
works
really
really
delicious
beer
i
had
a
few
pints
at
the
brewpub
it
pours
a
gorgeous
shade
of
gold
relatively
pale
nice
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
ton
of
flowery
hop
aroma
its
a
mouthwatering
mix
of
bright
citrus
tangerine
lemon
some
tropical
fruit
pineapplemango
and
light
sprucepine
just
wonderful
some
light
sugary
caramel
malt
peeks
through
the
hops
the
beer
is
dry
and
light
on
the
palate
theres
a
gentle
caramel
backbone
with
definite
but
light
bitterness
its
very
easy
to
drink
i
keep
using
the
word
light
but
its
a
very
flavorful
lightness
for
my
palate
its
perfectly
balanced
and
as
good
of
a
sessionish
ipa
not
really
sure
what
to
call
these
apas
that
are
dry
and
hopped
up
like
ipasdipas
as
ive
had
the
finish
is
crisp
with
more
marvelous
floral
hop
character
its
an
excellent
beer
i
still
remember
liking
hopfather
a
touch
more
so
ill
stick
with
4
5s
but
this
is
an
absolutely
worthy
edition
to
rrs
apaipadipa
lineup
ive
been
brewing
pale
ales
lately
and
man
i
wish
i
could
brew
something
like
this
i
like
the
hoppiness
and
malt
base
its
something
youd
find
in
an
ipa
but
its
not
high
in
abv
i
love
a
beer
that
i
can
have
a
couple
of
without
being
too
tipsy
pours
a
clear
golden
peach
color
with
a
white
head
and
nice
retention
tropical
nose
and
citrus
hops
with
light
pine
and
pale
malt
mild
flavor
compared
to
the
nose
but
pleasantly
fruity
and
sweet
particularly
mango
like
hops
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
o
a
nice
fragrant
and
light
ipa
perfect
way
to
start
my
day
so
this
is
a
single
hopped
simcoe
pale
ale
and
of
course
its
got
heavy
hops
goin
on
salty
piney
goodness
consistent
full
and
extremely
tasty
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
rr
so
im
glad
this
is
so
well
done
only
detractor
is
a
salty
aftertaste
my
first
beer
at
the
brewpub
and
a
good
way
to
start
d
this
is
ridiculous
could
substitute
for
water
im
kind
of
hoping
none
of
my
friends
stop
by
to
try
this
as
i
could
easily
put
away
the
entire
2l
im
actually
a
tad
surprised
this
is
almost
6
other
than
a
slowgrowing
buzz
theres
nothing
to
suggest
any
alcohol
content
at
all
gee
who
would
have
guessed
that
russian
river
could
make
another
worldclass
hoppy
pale
ale
not
quite
as
good
as
hoppy
birthday
but
pretty
excellent
nonetheless
pours
a
clear
peach
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
pretty
good
retention
nice
lacing
as
it
falls
to
a
collar
the
nose
carries
some
tropical
fruits
along
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
really
nice
nose
with
multiple
dimensions
its
not
particularly
over
the
top
either
flavor
is
similar
but
scaled
back
a
little
too
much
body
is
lightmedium
with
good
carbonation
and
a
solid
bitterness
quite
good
o
recommended
if
unremarkable
would
drink
again
as
a
tasty
ipa
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
the
beer
is
good
though
nice
finish
good
body
nice
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
good
throughout
i
could
easy
pound
pints
of
this
beer
for
a
long
time
very
enjoyable
the
beer
is
like
an
ipa
up
front
but
feels
lighter
and
finishes
without
a
lot
of
sticky
residue
this
actually
has
a
really
similar
flavor
profile
as
pliny
the
elder
just
turned
down
a
notch
its
like
ptes
little
bro
could
it
be
the
most
sessionable
pale
ive
encountered
right
up
there
hope
to
have
this
again
verdict
fantastic
pale
ale
from
russian
river
currently
a
draft
and
growler
only
option
but
soon
to
be
available
in
bottles
and
i
can
not
be
more
excited
for
anyone
near
the
brewery
this
is
worth
the
trip
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
quite
awesome
with
herbal
and
earthy
hops
citrus
zest
and
some
slight
tropical
fruit
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
malty
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
more
than
the
taste
simply
awesome
though
i
do
believe
humulus
wet
zombie
dust
and
hoppy
birthday
are
just
slightly
better
on
tap
at
brewery
for
beat
release
pours
a
nice
clear
bright
golden
orange
color
with
an
inch
of
white
frothy
head
scent
has
that
typical
russian
river
hoppy
beer
aroma
so
fresh
and
piney
lovely
citrus
mixed
with
sappy
pine
tree
aroma
so
inviting
taste
is
just
as
good
probably
the
most
userfriendly
pale
ale
they
offer
from
ones
that
ive
had
not
as
flavorful
as
the
nose
would
seem
to
imply
but
so
much
complexity
to
make
this
beer
as
light
as
it
is
its
ridiculous
lovely
in
your
face
dipa
flavors
just
mellowed
out
a
pit
to
suit
the
pale
ale
profile
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
one
fantastic
pale
ale
from
rr
as
expected
o
phenomenal
beer
another
glorious
showcase
of
hops
by
the
master
pray
to
the
beer
gods
that
they
bottle
this
one
in
the
future
recent
trends
in
american
pale
ales
continue
to
push
the
hop
envelope
further
with
increased
levels
of
bittering
and
a
more
pronounced
hop
character
zombie
dust
is
a
great
example
of
this
and
row
2hill
56
isnt
far
behind
excellent
flavor
balance
and
drinkability
make
this
an
exceptional
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
a
growler
of
o
enjoyed
every
drop
so
i
got
another
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
this
wonderful
light
body
with
soft
and
ample
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
a
vigorous
pour
results
in
three
fingers
of
rocky
white
foam
as
the
head
recedes
it
leaves
intricate
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
the
scent
of
oranges
mingled
with
pine
resin
fills
the
air
as
i
pour
this
smells
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pale
ale
and
i
must
say
that
it
smells
great
taste
opens
with
huge
citrus
flavors
orange
tangerine
and
mango
intermingle
with
hoppy
bitterness
a
sugar
cookie
malt
backbone
imparts
a
bit
of
sweetness
which
plays
nicely
against
the
hops
the
beer
finishes
semidry
with
a
very
subtle
aftertaste
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
yet
another
masterpiece
from
russian
river
the
malt
melds
seamlessly
with
the
hop
profile
providing
an
incredibly
balanced
brew
fruity
piney
and
mildly
bitter
the
beer
is
insanely
drinkable
and
very
tasty
well
done
mr
cilurzo
keep
up
the
good
work
from
a
growler
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
small
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
pine
hops
some
dankness
some
light
caramel
and
a
bit
of
grapefruit
this
certainly
smells
amazing
like
most
russian
river
hoppy
beers
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
pine
grapefruit
and
a
dankness
just
a
enough
malt
comes
through
to
balance
it
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
sugar
cookie
the
finish
has
a
decent
bitterness
to
it
mediumlight
body
moderate
carbonation
quite
dry
throughout
another
great
russian
river
beer
so
ive
split
this
one
with
my
dad
and
am
ruing
my
decision
i
think
the
appropriate
serving
size
for
this
beer
is
2liters
as
it
warms
up
it
becomes
increasingly
juicy
and
delicious
the
nose
exudes
a
certain
classiness
and
delicacy
that
really
calls
out
for
a
slightly
higher
score
i
want
to
up
the
scores
but
im
hesitant
overall
its
a
crime
that
this
went
under
the
radar
while
younger
was
pouring
this
is
an
incredible
pale
ale
move
aside
parking
violation
only
thing
lacking
especially
for
the
pale
ale
style
was
a
malt
backbone
almost
none
to
speack
of
just
enough
there
to
showcase
the
citrus
hops
upfront
first
and
for
most
never
had
a
more
citrus
forward
pale
although
zombie
dust
just
landed
on
my
doorstep
thanks
rfragga77
today
and
im
currently
in
tahoe
only
complaint
for
the
style
is
that
it
should
have
a
wee
bit
more
malt
but
still
if
this
ins
a
pale
give
me
this
all
day
d
very
drinkable
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
is
just
fantastic
on
this
beer
it
is
so
fresh
and
strong
from
start
to
end
without
being
overpowering
the
beer
also
stays
quite
sessionable
overall
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
the
hoppy
beers
coming
out
of
russian
river
maybe
someday
ill
be
able
to
make
the
younger
release
or
maybe
vinnie
would
allow
some
one
a
growler
fill
if
i
begged
him
hard
enough
its
hard
to
find
fault
in
this
beer
ive
got
a
soft
spot
for
low
abv
hop
bombs
and
this
beer
delivers
the
only
reason
its
not
a
perfect
5
0
for
me
is
because
alpines
hoppy
birthday
exists
but
this
is
pretty
damn
close
o
a
very
clean
refreshing
and
flavorful
beer
hops
were
fresh
and
easy
to
drink
bitterness
is
mellow
i
am
having
no
problem
finish
this
growler
myself
im
looking
forward
to
segal
select
but
otherwise
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
