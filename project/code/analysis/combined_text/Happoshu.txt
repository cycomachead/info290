drinkability
quite
drinkable
but
not
really
that
enjoyable
a
bit
too
simple
and
conservative
it
tastes
almost
as
if
they
were
hesitant
to
put
more
than
a
drop
of
miso
just
in
case
it
turned
people
off
if
it
wasnt
for
this
unusual
ingredient
then
it
would
be
bland
and
uninspiring
nice
medhigh
carbonation
suits
the
beer
well
d
this
beer
was
interesting
as
even
though
there
wasnt
a
lot
going
on
flavorwise
at
times
it
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
of
this
style
when
i
get
a
chance
as
it
was
actually
quite
good
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
enjoy
a
sixer
of
this
which
i
could
do
almost
seems
like
a
upgraded
lawn
mower
beer
thisd
probably
go
real
nicely
with
japanese
or
any
notparticularlyspicy
asian
food
and
its
certainly
easy
to
drink
on
its
own
its
damn
expensive
over
here
though
and
i
dont
like
it
enough
for
another
go
round
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
dopplebock
that
was
part
of
the
smell
that
i
couldnt
quite
place
as
i
taste
it
my
first
thought
is
doppelbock
it
has
a
really
strong
malty
flavor
with
a
big
bitter
finish
oh
my
god
this
beer
has
tons
of
character
loads
of
flavor
highly
drinkable
recommended
overall
an
intriguing
choice
a
tasty
nearly
flat
dark
beer
in
a
land
of
overcarbonated
lightyellow
beerpops
well
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
i
imagine
that
they
might
make
more
sales
of
this
beer
if
they
made
it
more
extreme
and
gimmicky
but
i
am
glad
they
settled
for
a
tasty
beer
instead
this
is
the
first
ale
ive
tried
from
the
helios
brewery
it
has
quite
a
thin
taste
but
was
undeniably
refreshing
its
not
incredibly
unusual
for
japanese
beers
but
its
very
drinkable
with
everything
well
balanced
and
spot
on
for
a
satisfying
summer
afternoon
beer
overall
im
excited
to
say
this
beer
has
character
as
well
as
it
tastes
just
like
the
okinawan
vegetable
on
the
can
is
it
good
maybe
was
it
worth
a
try
absolutely
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
nose
is
fruity
with
quite
a
bit
of
melon
some
sweet
malt
and
rice
notes
maybe
a
light
citrus
zest
and
vegetable
aroma
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
bitter
finish
definitely
a
strong
rice
flavor
and
somewhat
dry
a
little
disappointing
drinkability
few
beers
this
light
on
the
palate
are
this
interesting
and
tasty
making
this
exceptionally
drinkable
i
need
to
get
my
ass
to
okinawa
d
surprisingly
good
easy
drinking
i
thought
this
would
be
a
gimmicky
beer
but
instead
its
a
great
beer
NA
drinkablity
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
not
something
i
would
walk
too
far
for
though
the
can
ironically
has
3
stars
as
part
of
the
label
orion
southern
star
is
closer
to
a
2
not
impressed
drinkablity
not
the
worst
happoshu
ive
had
very
light
it
is
almost
like
not
having
a
beer
drinkablity
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
try
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
though
extremely
light
NA
NA
NA
by
the
way
dont
buy
it
its
the
same
price
as
other
better
ones
if
it
came
down
to
the
aqua
blue
and
draft
one
i
would
have
to
recommend
the
aqua
blue
because
at
least
it
isnt
foul
drinkability
is
pretty
bad
having
trouble
getting
through
my
half
of
the
can
no
depth
no
balance
no
redeeming
qualities
more
offensive
than

and
about
as
interesting
pours
a
crystal
clear

like

mixed
with

thin
bubbly
white

why
anyone

thanks
robbo
bizarre

and
now
happoshu
there
is
a
lot
about
modern
japanese
culture
i
just
dont
understand
whatever
neoalcohol
culture
sapporo
claims
this
nationwide
hotselling
product
to
have
created
i
dont
really
care
to
be
part
of
it
that
said
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
check
it
out
a
huge
domo
arigato
to
bobsy
avoid
overall
its
an
extremely
boring
beer
with
nothing
to
recommend
it
its
fine
if
you
want
a
thirstquencher
with
alcohol
in
it
and
have
no
money
to
get
anything
better
its
cheap
ill
give
it
that
i
cannot
see
why
this
is
so
popular
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
less
than
half
the
price
of
all
malt
beer
very
cheap
for
japanese
standards
and
utilizing
a
type
of
green
bean
this
beer
gets
points
for
being
interesting
d
this
is
my
second
favorite
cheap
japanese
happoshu
its
perfect
for
a
third
string
beer
its
also
easy
to
find
at
most
japanese
convenient
stores
and
super
markets
i
would
rate
this
higher
than
many
euro
pale
lagers
and
way
higher
than
macroamerican
adjunct
lagers
at
the
same
time
it
manages
to
be
a
step
or
two
above
many
of
its
local
competitors
in
this
price
class
please
remember
this
only
gets
a
score
this
high
by
being
good
for
a
happoshu
most
are
not
o
with
99
of
purines
cut
from
this
beer
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
tasty
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
seems
to
have
some
off
flavors
that
you
arent
normally
accustomed
toperhaps
similar
to
what
you
compare
a
glutenfree
beer
to
a
normal
beer

dont
know

some
very

greatly
lacking
in

feels

and
overall
is
nothing
worth
seeking
out
avoid
this
beer
was
so
boring
i
wouldnt
even
finish
the
can
if
served
by
a
supermodel
this
beer
looks
very
good
but
as
a
light
japanese
beer
it
is
indeed
light
and
lacking
in
what
one
expects
of
ones
beer
however
its
a
nice
golden
sunflower
color
and
it
is
extraordinarily
easy
to
drink
not
bad
for
a
light
happoshu
the
green
label
also
makes
me
happy
NA
NA
its
a
light
body
for
sure
and
runs
a
touch
thin
but
i
have
to
assume
that
since
it
holds
up
a
good
crispness
keeps
pretty
clean
and
without
any
grainy
astringency
and
has
at
least
a
modicum
of
smoothness
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
not
overall
o
this
beer
seems
a
lot
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
but
doesnt
have
much
of
the
adjunct
flavors
that
you
would
normally
expect
in

to

is
the

and
probably
my

favorite
of
the
brews
i
got
from
japan
as
long
as
you
drink
it
before
it
even
starts
to
get
warm
youre
doing
just
fine
drinkablity
a
serviceable
brew
but
it
did
not
have
too
much
to
offer
but
the
basics
drinkablity
a
serviceable
brew
hard
to
place
as
a
beer
designed
for
and
marketed
in
the
winter
season
d
refreshing
light
and
highly
drinkable
drinkability
well
if
getting
drunk
for
cheap
in
japan
on
a
wednesday
night
is
your
goal
then
you
cant
go
wring
with
this
one
its
easy
to
put
down
as
long
as
you
have
a
glass
golden
colour
with
a
rapidly
diminishing
white
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
metal
taste
is
a
bit
mild
and
bland
but
perhaps
par
for
the
course
for
a
happoshu
malty
sweetness
more
or
less
balanced
by
the
leafy
hops
fairly
soft
and
crisp
light
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
passable
for
the
style
but
i
slightly
prefer
the
enjuko
kuro
drinkablity
pretty
tame
all
around
very
easy
to
pound
down
this
one
poured
dark
with
little
head
and
no
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
was
very
influenced
by
the
can
tinny
and
sulfurous
in
terms
of
flavor
tin
was
the
first
flavor
on
the
palate
too
and
a
weak
barley
flavor
comes
out
last
my
drinking
partner
agreed
that
it
tasted
like
antique
shops
smell
you
couldnt
chug
this
beer
and
since
its
happoshu
and
it
doesnt
as
good
as
some
others
im
not
sure
what
to
do
with
this
one
the
taste
is
pretty
wellrounded
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
finish
i
give
it
4s
only
for
style
of
course
its
really
not
bad
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
its
great
uncle
kirin
lager
and
that
is
all
you
can
expect
from
this
beerlike
beverage
cheaper
than
japanese
beer
with
a
higher
abv
its
the
obvious
choice
to
go
along
with
chuhi
for
a
cheep
buzz
and
it
has
a
dark
brother
to
add
a
little
variety
to
your
swilling
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
good
comes
pretty
close
to
tasting
like
an
actual
beer
but
like
most
happoshu
its
got
just
a
few
too
many
off
flavors
that
keep
me
from
really
wanting
more
this
is
sort
of
like
a
filtered
americanstyle
wheat
beer
gotta
be
the
happoshu
of
choice
at
the
moment
it
is
a
bit
pricier
than
others
however
pretty
much
exactly
in
between
the
price
of
beer
and
happoshu
ingredients
malt
wheat
and
barley
hops
wheat
rice
corn
starch
sugars
nice
dark
brown
body
is
let
down
by
a
rapidly
fading
offwhite
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
mild
nut
and
caramel
flavours
going
on
taste
has
some
cocoa
and
caramel
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
leafy
hops
fairly
soft
in
the
mouth
and
with
a
refreshing
crispness
from
the
steady
stream
of
bubbles
light
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
in
taste
terms
this
one
is
reminiscent
of
a
classic
british
mild
but
even
though
it
is
called
kuro
black
it
is
not
its
more
like
a
very
dark
brown
as
youd
see
when
you
get
near
the
end
of
the
glass
its
nothing
like
a
stout
or
porter
and
is
sweet
though
not
offputtingly
so
and
carries
a
hint
of
caramel
its
6
and
being
used
to
milds
id
have
guessed
it
was
more
like
3
6
the
big
problem
is
that
kuro
is
synonymous
with
stout
so
a
drinker
looking
for
a
creative
lowmalt
take
on
stout
will
be
very
disappointed
by
the
fact
that
this
is
usui
like
any
other
happoshu
the
taste
is
not
so
hot
brings
me
back
to
earth
oh
yeah
this
is
happoshu
but
a
pretty
good
one
again
like
the
regular
enjuku
its
got
a
nice
all
around
flavor
highly
drinkable
believe
the
hype
check
it
out
we
may
have
a
winner
here
best
cheap
beer
in
japan
overall
well
at
least
its
clean
and
refreshing
overall
this
was
actually
pretty
good
and
i
think
something
like
this
would
be
a
huge
seller
to
the
bmc
crowd
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
bottom
line
unoffensive
uninteresting
bland
overall
a
bit
uninspiring
though
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
bursting
with
hops
i
was
at
least
hoping
to
see
a
trace
of
it
no
go
and
this
beer
fails
on
that
account
its
not
foul
tasting
by
any
means
but
its
quite
bland
actually
oh
well
i
was
happy
to
try
a
style
that
is
practically
impossible
to
have
here
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
malt
slightly
fruity
and
earthy
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
reminds
me
of
michelob
ultra
or
odouls
taste
is
mild
slight
fruit
and
sweet
malt
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
be
slightly
detectable
there
is
a
weird
phenolic
taste
that
i
can
best
describe
as
what
you
get
with
that
last
sip
of
diet
fountain
soda
from
burger
king
you
know
when
the
plastic
from
the
straw
leeches
itself
upon
the
underlying
drink
inside
the
cup
then
again
maybe
that
only
happens
to
me
crisp
carbonation
thin
body
with
a
bone
dry
finish
mouthfeel
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sparkling
water
5
alcohol
is
virtually
undetectable
i
dont
know
if
this
a
good
happoshu
or
bad
i
felt
it
to
be
light
and
somewhat
refreshing
although
not
much
flavor
going
on
here
i
am
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
if
im
ever
in
japan
ill
try
some
more
yet
another
thankful
recipient
of
einweizenbittes
generosity
here
thanks
so
much
for
the
chance
to
try
this
very
elusive
style
the
can
says
new
zealand
hop
included
my
understanding
of
the
style
is
that
it
is
brewed
mostly
with
rice
with
some
barley
as
an
adjunct
and
was
made
originally
to
take
advantage
of
some
byzantine
tax
laws
that
taxed
based
on
percentage
of
barley
malt
or
some
such
arbitrariness
i
expected
this
to
be
have
a
very
low
abv
and
i
was
surprised
that
this
was
5
very
cool
textured
can
pours
a
very
pale
golden
with
little
head
a
small
cap
sticks
around
smells
of
sweet
rice
and
earthy
hops
light
and
grainy
tastes
better
than
expected
quite
a
bit
of
rice
flavor
and
this
is
pretty
ricey
with
lots
of
sweet
rice
not
like
a
subtle
adjunct
as
in
bud
light
and
spritzy
but
you
can
actually
taste
some
hops
here
which
are
earthy
and
herbal
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
citrus
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
spritzy
and
just
slightly
on
the
sweeter
side
but
quite
refreshing
i
am
usually
a
fan
of
rice
beverages
i
love
sake
for
instance
and
the
rice
flavor
is
clean
and
deep
here
and
the
hops
actually
register
i
find
this
strangely
compelling
drinkability
not
especially
endearing
but
it
disappear
readily
thanks
todd
overall
it
was
an
interesting
beer
i
got
this
to
try
the
style
so
wasnt
expecting
much
after
reading
the
reviews
and
it
pretty
much
delivered
what
i
expected
in
aroma
but
was
disappointing
in
the
taste
hugely
appreciative
of
einweizenbitte
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
it
d
not
too
bad
glad
i
was
able
to
try
the
style
once
again
a
huge
thanks
to
einweizenbitte
for
hauling
these
home
to
share
im
not
going
to
lie
sparkling
hop
is
not
an
amazing
beer
sorry
to
offend
any
happoshu
lovers
i
will
say
this
about
this
beer
it
is
refreshing
its
light
crisp
and
easy
drinking
d
id
pick
this
over
most
macros
and
it
wasnt
too
hard
to
finish
although
it
was
a
bit
bloaty
positives
include
the
can
format
neutral
aftertaste
low
abv
and
price
in
japan
still
im
not
gonna
rush
out
to
sample
other
examples
of
happoshu
any
time
soon
hey
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
this
exceeded
my
expectations
if
i
was
a
dude
in
japan
golfing
on
the
weekend
after
ponying
up
my
500000
yen
a
round
or
whatever
the
hell
it
is
to
golf
in
tokyo
i
wouldnt
mind
a
cold
sixer
of
these
puppies
in
my
bag
why
not
im
kinda
getting
bummed
that
its
getting
towards
the
empty
part
of
the
glass
to
tell
you
the
truth
so
thats
gotta
say
something
it
is
a
very
mediocre
beer
but
i
am
very
happy
i
finally
tried
this
elusive
style
if
this
is
truly
representative
it
is
a
style
to
be
forgotten
other
than
slightly
soapy
character
it
is
pretty
inoffensive
with
just
enough
subtle
bitter
balance
it
is
pretty
bland
though
it
says
that
it
uses
new
zealand
hop
the
singular
rather
than
plural
is
quite
fitting
here
i
suppose
its
better
more
balanced
than
most
macros
to
be
fair
im
very
thankful
for
the
opportunity
thanks

this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
good
or
bad
is
it
better
that
drinking
water
yes
does
it
have
offensive
flavors
no
there
is
more
flavor
with
each
exhale
than
with
each
sip
it
is
tough
to
review
this
beer
becuase
i
cant
really
describe
good
or
bad
qualities
there
just
arent
any
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
and
i
would
drink
more
of
this
style
if
it
was
available
as
for
the
new

off

with

a

this
is
almost
at

hangoverinaglass
sweet
ok
not
quite
that
bad
but
i
will
be
damn
impressed
if
you
can
finish
a
whole
bottle
of
this
a
experiment
but
the
results
are
pretty
regrettable
avoid
my
friends
overall
an
interesting
but
overall
awkward
beer
im
not
entirely
sure
the
flavour
is
something
that
feels
right
being
added
to
a
beer
the
biggest
issue
is
the
price
however
at
au8
50
per
333ml
bottle
not
worth
that
nowhere
near
it
flavorful
with
a
visually
appealing
hue
this
is
a
rather
welcome
variation
on
an
otherwise
unremarkable
style
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
only
a
step
up
from
par
but
its
far
from
bad
and
as
an
ingredient
in
the
popular
variety
of
sake
shochu
the
sweet
potato
contributes
an
interesting
japanese
twist
did
not
expect
this
for
my
first
happoshu
first
sweet
potato
beer
too
expected
some
kind
of
bland
earthyveggie
beer
with
weird
maltiness
got
a
really
nice
tasty
ale
instead
nice
having
said
all
that
it
is
unique
with
malt
overload
and
sweet
hit
i
havent
had
anything
like
it
before
o
a
mildly
sweet
boozy
and
interesting
style
first
for
me
maybe
there
are
better
happoshu
beers
out
there
but
from
how
little
seems
to
be
out
there
probably
not
then
again
ive
never
been
to
japan
the
most
interesting
thing
is
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
an
alcohol
malt
liquor
sugar
bomb
but
its
actually
well
hidden
and
drinks
real
easily
most
of
the
happoshu
ive
heard
about
is
a
canned
cheap
swill
beverage
but
this
is
a
little
different
even
if
its
not
really
looking
that
appealing
oi
think
this
beer
is
interesting
but
woulndt
seek
it
out
again
it
has
cellared
well
for
7
months
fwiw
seems
my
review
matches
up
well
with
most
of
the
others
here
best
beer
from
coedo
ive
had
beautiful
copper
brown
appearance
but
like
most
of
their
beers
a
very
watery
texture
very
flat
and
zero
head
the
pour
is
fairly
exciting
but
the
head
is
very
very
temporary
they
have
copied
the
chimay
packaging
it
seems
like
i
enjoy
the
taste
and
appearance
and
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
fruit
and
caramel
is
great
but
the
body
is
just
too
thin
wouldnt
recommend
it
actually
quite
decent
despite
the
adjunct
aroma
and
flavors
in
there
food
match
its
a
bit
of
a
given
japanese
beer
japanese
food
so
ill
refrain
from
the
obvious
what
i
will
say
is
that
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
a
good
old
fashioned
american
thanksgiving
dinner
replete
with
turkey
mashed
yams
cranberry
sauce
corn
and
the
obligatory
pumpkin
pie
slice
for
dessert

feels
a
bit

quite

notes
of
honey
emerging
over

and
i
find
this
quite
a
tasty
beer
surprisingly
this
seems
to
me
quite
different
than
the
first
time
i
tried
itlighter
fruitier
and
generally
more
exciting
some
alcohol
emerges
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
along
with
a
more
distinctive
sweet
potato
flavor
but
neither
of
these
take
the
beer
out
of
balance
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
and
look
forward
to
having
it

a

by

the

ever

very
elusive
style
that
i
am
psyched
i
found
and
tried
the
use
of
noncorngrainrice
as
the
adjunct
malts
definitely
makes
it
a
unique
experience
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
beer
and
felt
it
easy
to
drink
one
you
could
have
many
of
in
a
session
matches
well
with
sushi
some
definite
complexity
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
would
get
this
one
again
o
this
beer
style
is
definitely
unique
and
sweet
potato
is
more
interesting
as
an
adjunct
malt
compared
to
corn
and
rice
it
definitely
tastes
a
lot
more
flavorful
compared
to
japanese
rice

a

burnt

flavors
there
is
a
weird
herbalmedicinal
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
only
a
very
slight
crispness
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
very
odd
burnt
vegetable
flavor
that
is
kind
of
gross
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
the
maruhiro
department
store
in
saitama
japan
poured
into
a
suntory
premium
malts
modest
tulip
glass
creates
a
wonderful
yellow
custard
hued
head
and
releases
a
noticeable
fragrant
aroma
of
hops
and
sugar
this
beer
is
partially
made
from
sweet
potato
so
that
sugary
flavor
definitely
comes
out
in
a
pleasant
way
that
almost
seems
chocolatey
with
a
relatively
strong
abv
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
afterdinner
brew
on
the
same
note
i
wouldnt
probably
have
this
with
a
meal
but
definitely
went
well
with
the
strawberries
i
was
eating
at
the
same
time
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
coedo
brewery
and
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
regular
beer
if
you
can
find
it
the
color
is
a
beautiful
amber
and
i
picked
up
sweet
sakelike
aromas
the
alcohol
is
7
here
id
have
liked
a
little
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
more
hops
would
balance
the
fruity
qualities
from
the
sweet
potatoes
try
bringing
this
unique
beer
to
a
thanksgiving
dinner
it
should
fit
right
in
othe
best
ive
had
from
coedo
wish
it
had
a
little
more
going
for
it
other
than
the
sweet
potato
o
quite
an
unusual
brew
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
try
drinkable
but
not
your
typical
beer
profile
good
to
try
as
a
curiosity
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
be
much
more
interesting
but
it
really
wasnt
anything
to
brag
about
it
had
a
reddish
color
which
was
nice
but
no
head
which
always
bums
me
out
the
brew
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
not
much
in
there
that
made
it
super
appealing
on
any
level
this
had
a
strong
abv
but
thats
about
all
i
could
really
say
about
it
drinkability
really
a
different
beer
and
one
you
probably
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
not
bad
but
not
great
either
worth
trying
drinkability
im
surprised
by
this
unique
and
tasty
brew
its
only
25
malt
according
to
the
coedo
website
but
it
manages
to
have
a
lot
of
character
despite
this
good
stuff
this
lack
of
balance
really
hurts
the
drinkability
normally
i
dont
like
to
waste
beer
but
in
this
case
i
was
actually
tempted
to
just
pour
it
down
the
drain
and
be
done
with
it
coedo
produces
some
very
good
beers
which
makes
this
one
all
the
more
disappointing
this
is
a
japanese
sweet
potato
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
into
a
pint
glass
light
smell
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
slight
potato
flavor
mouthfeel
has
a
mellow
roasty
taste
drinkability
is
decentnot
overwhelming
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
sweet
backend
the
sweet
potato
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
NA
get
the
red
honnama
one
instead
that
one
actually
tastes
like
a
cheap
beer
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
this
one
tastes
like
dirty
club
soda
the
crack
and
inverted
glug
was
perfect

could

bordering

but
not
quite
achieving
it
as
king
midas
nodded
his

nose
smelled
grassy
very
much
like
a
german
pilsner
mouthfeel
was
very
fizzy
and
effervescent
quite
like
soda
pop
really
the
taste
was
very
mild
and
unobtrusive
kind
of
like
a
watereddown
cross
between
7up
and
ginger
ale
the
finish
left
me
with
a
tingly
feeling
in
my
mouth
like
i
had
been
licking
batteries
i
do
not
mean
that
to
be
funny
or
derogatory
but
that
is
what
it
reminded
me
of
it
was
dry
and
refreshing
but
utterly
unique
in
my
experience
how
do
you
rate
one
of
these
back
in
my
hostel
in
tokyo
and
enjoying

is

thirst
quenching

kind

and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
but
not
bad
at
this
price
point
drink
well

this
was
pretty
good

not

why
the
hate
i
will
say
best
serve
cold

my
beer
wouldnt
skimp

me
so
why
should
i
skimp
on
my
beer
it
seems
like
asahi
is
making
something
called
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
to
drink
beer
about
like
a
watereddown

the
only

point
of
this

that

bad
but
also
artificial
lemon
and
oxidation
notes
taste
is
even
more
horrible
having
everything
a
brew
should
have
not
and
missing
taste
as
it
is
almost
water
lots
of
cardboard
and
xweet
oxidation
with
it
makes
this
brew
into
one
of
the
most
horrible
beers
ive
ever
expierienced
mouthfeel
as
water
no
bitterness
and
only
bad
tastecomponents
make
mouthfeel
and
drinkablilityalso
to
a
nightmare
and
avoid
is
the
only
thing
i
can
say
9
parts
soda
water
1
parts
bud
this
really
boring
enough
to
be
awful
i
pulled
deep
to
find
something
to
say
but
it
just
is
not
coming
this
has
no
flavor
or
after
flavor
this
is
truly
a
very
bad
beer
it
really
has
nothing
going
for
it
its
says
on
the
can
its
50
off
which
im
taking
to
mean
its
a
light
beer
of
some
sort
it
in
fact
tastes
very
much
like
seltzer
water
with
a
cheap
beer
aftertaste
really
the
resemblance
to
seltzer
water
is
impressive
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
to
write
except
advice
not
to
try
this
beer
ever
it
tastes
quite
sterile
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
quite
fizzy
straight
out
the
gate
but
tapers
off
pretty
quickly
for
more
than
5
abv
it
works
i
am
not
saying
this
is
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
fitting
for
what
it
is
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
few
of
these
with
the
appropriate
japanese
food
pairing
d
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
really
care
to
drink
that
much
d
shall
i
pummel
the
felled
equine
any
further
thanks
very
sincerely
to
einweizenbitte
for
sharing
with
me
and
so
many
other
bas
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
isnt
bad
actually
i
drank
this
one
after
a
day
of
working
on
the
house
and
it
went
down
pretty
easy
it
didnt
really
have
a
lot
of
flavor
or
range
though
so
its
not
something
id
personally
choose
to
drink
much
of
not
any
worse
then
the
american
macros
though
and
pretty
comparable
the
beer
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
corn
grain
and
a
little
malty
sweetness
has
that
unmistakable
american
adjunct
lager
flavor
tastes
of
corn
grains
and
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
a
small
amount
of
hop
bitterness
the
beer
has
a
thin
water
mouthfeel
and
tons
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
d
this
was
my
second
happoshu
again
i
was
thrilled
at
the
opportunity
to
indulge
in
this
very
elusive
beer
style
while
it
was
very
cool
from
an
experience
standpoint
the
beer
itself
wasnt
that
enjoyable
thanks
to
alex
via
someone
for
this
style
tick
alex
keeps
feeding
the
beast
a
sexy
can
served
in
my
darkness
glass
pours
a
super
clear
medium
gold
with
about
three
fingers
of
head
the
head
just
looks
weak
watery
and
whispy
but
it
actually
hangs
for
a
bit
and
has
surprisingly
full
lacing
a
medium
skunk
aroma
rice
alcohol
at
first
its
pretty
offensive
but
settles
down
the
taste
is
light
a
little
grain
almost
no
flavor
like
drinking
a
glass
of
water
that
had
a
drop
of
beer
dumped
in
as
flavoring
it
doesnt
taste
bad
or
offend
me
like
a
bad
macro
the
feel
is
really
bad
worse
than
water
easy
to
drink
like
a
glass
of
water
but
if
i
wanted
something
that
light
id
just
drink
a
glass
of
water
the
taste
is
loads
of
rice
along
with
some
cooked
vegetables
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
pretty
gross
and
near
undrinkable
i
might
say
that
this
style
may
be
worse
than
american
light
lager
if
the
two
ive
had
are
at
all
representative
of
the
style
beer
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
decently
clean
finish
it
tastes
like
a
really
really
light
pilsner
overall
its
just
ok
better
than
the
other
one
i
had
for
sure
and
the
boot
experience
comes
to
an
end
the
brew
sits
in
the
boot
creating
the
appearance
of
a
pale
workboot
topped
by
a
thick
white
sock
the
nose
comprises
light
corn
syrup
and
rice
not
really
anything
else
in
there
if
you
ask
me
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
though
with
a
bit
less
sweetness
from
the
corn
syrup
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
light
carbonation
a
watery
feel
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
another
easily
drinkable
happoshu
but
the
touch
of
dryness
at
the
end
puts
this
one
slightly
below
the
tanrei
this
beer
looks
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
of
rice
and
a
sourish
adjunct
funk
the
flavor
is
mainly
of
the
rice
hulls
that
were
used
in
the
production
of
this
beer
i
didnt
know
they
could
be
entirely
made
into
a
beer
but
this
is
that
beer
its
pretty
adjuctlike
all
around
so
its
hard
really
to
like
this
beer
its
the
better
of
the
2
that
i
was
provided
but
it
really
wasnt
too
pleasant
of
a
drinking
experience
this
almost
seemed
skunky
which
coming
from
a
can
makes
you
just
begin
to
wonder
what
was
put
into
this
beer
this
drinks
not
all
that
great
but
you
can
get
used
to
it
if
you
want
to
tick
it
go
for
it
if
you
were
just
curious
about
it
stay
away
from
happoshus
not
a
big
fan
of
this
happoshu
really
but
i
appreciate
the
tick
thanks
nick
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
retains
poorly
mild
aroma
pale
malt
and
rice
sweet
and
clean
palate
is
malty
clean
mildly
astringent
some
adjuncty
sweetness
in
the
finish
light
and
quaffable
not
a
particularly
bad
brew
not
the
worst
choice
when
you
are
low
on
cash
and
want
a
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
if
you
find
yourself
in
japan
leave
any
beer
made
by
asahi
alone
kirin
is
much
better
my
first
taste
really
surprised
me
this
tastes
more
like
a
real
beer
than
a
happoshu
initially
it
seemed
extremely
hoppy
and
bitter
for
the
style
but
as
i
finish
the
can
i
start
to
doubt
my
first
impression
it
could
be
that
i
really
havent
had
any
happoshus
lately
other
than
a
review
for
namashibori
and
this
one
just
seems
to
have
much
more
flavor
anyway
its
really
not
bad
at
all
ill
say
good
for
drinkability
i
will
revisit
this
one
some
time
taste
misses
body
and
is
very
clean
but
pale
not
much
malt
not
much
bitterness
litle
alcoholic
and
some
ricetaste
aswell
as
a
litle
whipped
cream
taste
good
carbonisation
thats
quiet
high
makes
it
even
more
watery
drinkable
certainly
on
a
warm
day
but
dont
expect
lots
of
taste
d
this
was
a
decent
quaffing
beer
not
to
be
saught
out
but
something
for
a
hot
day
im
glad
asahi
gave
this
one
the
axe
after
only
a
year
bb
2006
04
nice
but
dissappearing
quiet
rapid
white
head
and
a
golden
beer
thats
clear
nose
is
buttery
litle
maltyness
like
some
alcohol
and
very
low
dosed
yeast
esters
overall
empty
and
buttery
reminding
a
lot
of
fat
oxidation
taste
is
hard
to
dig
also
being
extremly
oxidated
annd
watery
hardly
any
taste
and
even
less
beery
notes
no
body
and
no
bitterness
something
far
off
from
beer
at
all
and
wonder
if
there
is
malt
in
this
at
all
ingedients
are
hops
sugars
yeast
extract
soy
peptides
karamel
coloring
drinkablity
alright
but
nothing
too
special
i
would
not
go
too
far
for
this
one
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
but
this
is
really
bitter
for
the
style
so
i
like
it
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
happoshus
i
have
had
please
note
that
the
high
ratings
this
beer
received
was
because
i
was
rating
it
within
style
against
a
jever
or
even
a
pilsner
urquell
it
would
likely
get
straight
2
o
boy
another
new
beer
to
try
here
in
tokyo
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
nothing
special
is
a
servicable
beer
o
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
and
better
than
the
japanese
rice
lagers
that
i
have
had
thus
far
would
be
interested
in
trying
more
in
the
style
actually
to
see
if
there
are
any
major
differences
though
i
doubt
it
o
excellent
water
beer
i
wish
this
was
commonly
available
here
very
easy
to
drink
with
dinner
or
whenever
well
this
seems
very
much
like
a
pretty
plain
inoffensive
lager
and
quite
easy
to
put
back
which
i
suppose
is
the
whole
point
if
the
malt
bill
is
that
much
lower
than
actual
beer
id
be
curious
to
know
what
all
those
much
thinner
skunkier
real
beers
out
there
have
going
on
under
the
hood
d
this
is
my
other
favorite
happoshu
a
wonderful
cost
effective
third
string
beer
for
japans
market
great
when
youre
low
on
cash
or
far
away
from
the
belgian
beer
store
available
at
convenient
stores
and
supermarkets
nationwide
NA
NA
i
knew
i
had
tried
this
style
before
but
forgot
which
one
until
i
saw
this
and
even
had
a
picture
to
along
with
it
they
sold
six
packs
of
this
stuff
at
the
local
grocery
store
i
believe
one
of
the
weirder
beers
i
had
over
there
probably
will
never
drink
again
but
not
too
worried
about
it
probably
better
examples
of
this
style
but
who
knows
smells
like
nothing
which
is
positive
for
the
style
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
impressively
neutral
with
a
touch
of
something
chemicallike
and
artificial
in
the
aftertaste
which
seems
to
be
unavoidable
in
these
nomalt
brews
ug
wildly
overcarbonated
d
went
ok
with
food
bu
once
the
grub
was
gone
there
was
definately
no
desire
to
drink
this
i
guess
this
is
just
a
poor
substitute
for
water
and
thats
about
all
i
can
say
about
suntorys
jokki
its
not
terrible
very
average
for
the
style
it
has
no
smell
or
taste
to
speak
of
think
watered
down
bud
wow
another
japanese
beer
to
try
while
here
in
tokyo
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
are
present
taste
is
light
malty
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
yet
another
mediocre
beer
thanks
to
hopface
for
sending
me
this
rarity
from
japan
typical
of
the
japanese
style
just
higher
alcohol
it
reminds
me
of
cheap
stale
beer
in
cans
leftover
from
youth
parties
this
is
the
antithesis
of
high
quality
euro
type
beer
it
is
fitting
that
i
am
drinking
it
in
a
japanese
business
hotel
room
where
it
may
be
popular
i
should
have
gone
with
the
sake
instead
where
the
japanese
are
masters
o
decent
certainly
more
interesting
than
an
average
lager
o
absolutely
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
but
in
a
pinch
i
could
handle
drinking
this
again
worth
remembering
for
the
next
time
im
in
japan
a
bit
different
than
the
typical
japanese
lagers
and
an
interesting
change
of
pace
this
vs
bud
light
no
doubt
id
go
for
this
but
that
really
doesnt
say
much
still
worth
a
shot
if
faced
with
any
number
of
other
japanese
or
american
macro
lagers
out
there
as
the
other
choice
drinkablity
great
brew
with
an
easy
to
drink
yet
bold
flavor
drinkablity
decent
brew
not
a
standout
another
boring
happoshu
note
while
previous
fall
seasonal
offerings
from
suntory
have
generally
been
happoshu
primarily
in
that
they
contained
less
than
25
malted
barley
in
order
to
fall
into
a
cheaper
bracket
in
the
japanese
alcohol
tax
code
akiraku
is
actually
classified
in
the
increasingly
popular
though
horrifically
bad
liqueur
carbonated
type
1
category
i
guess
this
is
what
happens
when
you
have
tax
accountantsbureaucrats
coming
up
with
names
to
categorize
alcoholic
beverages
these
drinks
fall
into
a
tax
category
even
cheaper
than
happoshu
and
are
beverages
that
are
essentially
happoshu
to
which
have
been
added
a
mixture
of
grain
alcohol
derived
from
barley
or
wheat
and
a
little
bit
of
carbonated
gas
