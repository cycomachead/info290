i
was
not
too
happy
with
this
one
it
smelled
funky
and
just
kind
of
for
lack
of
a
better
term
off
the
taste
was
similar
but
only
slightly
better
overall
the
taste
and
aroma
are
grainy
but
in
an
unappealing
way
will
not
get
again
poured
nicely
with
a
white
creamy
head
however
it
dissipated
very
quickly
and
the
taste
was
too
bland
for
being
a
german
bock
overall
disappointing
low
c
of
all
of
the
trader
joes
beers
this
is
probably
my
favorite
with
the
exception
of
their
vintage
ale
and
providential
golden
ale
made
by
unibroue
its
a
clean
straightforward
helles
bock
thats
got
just
the
right
amount
of
maltiness
to
it
so
that
its
not
too
thin
too
full
or
too
sticky
and
its
got
some
decent
floral
and
spicy
hops
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
head
retention
and
lacing
could
be
a
bit
better
the
aroma
could
be
slightly
fuller
and
perhaps
the
malt
quality
itself
but
as
far
as
american
brewed
versions
of
the
style
go
its
topnotch
with
that
said
just
getting
a
malty
7
abv
beer
for
1
17
28
for
a
case
is
next
to
impossible
i
was
never
a
fan
of
light
beers
until
i
tried
the
jb
heller
bock
it
starts
crisp
but
gains
weight
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
a
meaty
malt
flavor
serving
type
bottle
overall
im
not
familiar
with
this
style
and
what
to
compare
it
to
but
its
a
decent
beer
that
at
the
very
least
is
an
easy
drinker
if
something
simple
is
desired
solid
malt
flavor
but
the
hops
are
way
too
spiced
up
worth
drinking
if
ya
got
it
for
free
but
certainly
not
something
id
paid
for
or
recommend
71100
o
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
a
pretty
decent
offering
especially
for
the
price
easy
enough
to
drink
and
enjoyable
worth
grabbing
for
the
price
and
worth
sampling
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
to
light
patches
and
thin
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malt
hints
of
lemon
and
toffee
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malt
light
lemon
and
toffee
and
grassy
hops
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
an
adequate
mild
take
on
a
heller
bock
without
much
character
to
the
hops
hits
the
right
notes
in
the
malt
profile
delivers
on
its
purpose
an
inexpensive
nicely
made
domestic
heller
bock
rjt
overall
its
not
a
bad
helles
bock
but
doesnt
stand
out
for
the
style
either
however
given
the
price
of
trader
joes
beers
5
99
a
sixer
at
my
local
place
if
you
like
helles
bocks
this
is
a
perfectly
fine
choice
i
dont
mind
breaking
the
tie
based
on
price
when
all
else
is
equal
in
beer
selection
1638
the
taste
was
fairly
routine
for
the
style
with
some
caramel
malts
and
crisp
clean
hops
nothing
special
ill
admit
that
maibocks
arent
my
favorite
beers
still
josephbraus
heller
bock
isnt
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
nor
is
it
a
beer
that
ill
be
drinking
again

i
would
not
by
this
brew
again
offers
a
firm
and
steady
hop
delivery
regardless
of
agitation
in
the
glass
distinctive
german
character
yet
with
more
than
average
intrigue
t
nutty
and
a
touch
bitter
almost
like
pistachio
nut
oil
a
lot
of
graininess
malt
syrup
slight
almond
and
a
tad
of
faded

mouthfeel
is
way
heavy
allowing
the
sweetness
to
become
overbearing
not
recommended
the
abv
to
ratio
is
strong
in
this
one
i
had
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
and
really
enjoyed
it
especially
at
6
99
a
six
pack
more
bitterness
than
i
remembered
tastes
better
the
longer
it
sits
good
beer
that
id
have
again
but
wouldnt
go
hunting
it
down
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
one
that
ill
revisit
there
are
much
better
mai
bocks
out
there
and
josephsbrau
produces
much
better
affordable
beers
you
might
as
well
try
it
i
suspect
that
you
wont
buy
a
second
bottle
overall
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
maibock
but
it
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
germanstyle
beer
to
me
and
man
is
the
price
right
on
this
or
what
6
99
a
sixpack
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
mailbock
and
is
a
relatively
good
representation
of
the
style
o
a
pretty
standard
bock
not
too
cloying
which
is
a
standard
fault
but
could
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
to
make
it
more
pleasant
to
drink
more
of
a
preference
though
the
verdict
average
the
running
theme
here
is
mild
mild
aroma
mild
taste
mild
price
the
only
thing
thats
not
mild
is
the
abv
drinkable
but
nothing
exciting
about
it
o
a
very
very
tasty
and
authentic
german
beer
as
typical
with
tj
brand
beers
this
is
a
huge
bang
for
your
buck
this
beer
is
pretty
much
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
i
love
german
beers
and
there
isnt
a
better
value
for
the
quality
youre
getting
here
you
can
by
these
by
the
single
bottle
but
why
would
you
when
there
are
six
packs
available
taste
has
floral
hop
notes
mixed
with
a
toffeegrainy
malt
flavor
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
rough
and
is
not
masked
very
well
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
i
kind
of
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
lively
carbonation
not
too
bad
for
a
helles
bock
but
at
this
price
it
might
be
worth
a
repeat
purchase
one
of
these
days
overall
one
of
the
better
styles
from
trader
joes
beer
selections
notes

hard
to
get

that
is
better
than
expected
from

job
on

it
leans
perhaps
towards
a

not

i
wouldnt

the
body
was
nicely
full
and
smooth
although
the
stickiness
of
the
finish
was
a
bit
annoying
drinkability
was
decent
id
have
another
overall
as
with
most
of
the
tjs
brews
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
a
good
solid
one
and
a
decent
value
o
its
cheap
1
drinkable
and
features
7
alcohol
but
the
beer
itself
doesnt
impress
too
intrusively
offbeat
to
be
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
hate
it
overall
this
bock
is
not
bad
i
really
can
say
i
am
impressed
more
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
store
brand
beer
would
i
try
it
again
well
yes
if
i
was
low
on
cash
because
these
trader
joe
brews
are
a
real
bargain
6
49
for
a
six
pack
or
1
09
a
bottle
i
really
enjoyed
this
bock
and
fastic
value
for
a
dollar
two
finger
thick
white
head
with
good
retention
but
little
lacing
on
a
clear
golden
amber
body
aroma
is
malty
with
gingerbread
and
a
light
spicey
note
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
full
malt
backbone
and
gingerbread
notes
fairly
smooth
with
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
a
flavorful
beer
and
a
nice
version
of
the
style
just
not
very
memorable
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
that
only
foams
this
up
slightly
on
the
palate
result
is
that
beer
stagnates
a
bit
in
the
mouth
finish
is
quite
dry
a
straightforward
but
well
brewed
and
inexpensive
version
of
the
style
o
the
aroma
and
appearance
of
the
beer
was
outstanding
and
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
real
treat
but
that
wasnt
the
case
i
am
still
sitting
with
this
flowery
flavor
in
my
mouth
that
makes
me
feel
like
i
just
ate
a
bunch
of
flower
petals
there
is
too
much
caramel
sweetness
in
this
beer
and
it
overpowers
the
malt
flavors
that
could
have
been
enjoyed
i
would
suggest
they
lay
of
the
caramel
malts
a
bit
and
figure
out
a
way
to
reduce
the
harshness
e
g
dont
use
as
fine
as
a
grain
crush
or
maybe
watching
the
sparging
ph
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on

of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
grassy
notes
and
a
light
fruity
aroma
taste
is
of
maltgrain
grassy
hops
and
some
light
fruit
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
that
quickly
fades
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
in
my
opinion
poured
this
helles
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
produced
an
average
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
produced
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
faint
some
amount
of
malts
and
hops
come
through
light
in
body
the
helles
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
has
some
biscuit
flavor
toasted
malt
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
overall
it
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
helles
great
value
for
about
1
25
a
bottle
prost
id
pair
this
with
a
lamb
shank
and
mashed
potatoes
oh
yes
that
sounds
perfect
o
a
fine
if
not
exceptional
golden
bock
an
average
flawed
beer
overall
i
think
it
was
an
ok
beer
its
good
for
anyone
that
likes
moderately
high
hoppybitter
beer
it
wasnt
bad
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
of
white
that
reached
a
height
of
around
an
inch
and
half
before
settling
back
down
to
earth
and
leaving
just
thin
lacing
in
its
wake
but
for
the
style
nice
and
a
classic
look
aroma
of
sweet
bready
malts
and
a
classic
caramel
aroma
that
was
cut
with
a
touch
of
grain
nice
and
clean
with
a
semi
crisp
feel
and
an
overall
nice
balanced
body
that
really
seem
to
let
the
taste
pop
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
at
6
a
6
pack
and
7
abv
its
perfect
to
pick
up
before
going
to
a
bbq
o
got
quite
a
bit
better
as
i
drank
my
inital
impressions
were
none
to
good
solid
example
of
the
style
at
very
good
price
point
as
the
majority
of
the
tjs
beers
ive
had
have
been
i
have
been
drinking
this
stuff
for
years
so
might
as
well
make
it
official
when
so
many
average
beers
in
san
diego
go
for
over
9
bucks
a
six
this
is
almost
half
that
especially
a
bargain
for
a
strong
flavorful
bock
even
better
it
stands
up
well
to
big
hops
as
a
mixer
with
the
other
half
of
that
ipa

a

brew
with
3
fingers
of

that
sticks
around

and
clovergrassy
nice
sweet
maltiness
in
flavor
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
light
grass
hops
to
end
it
this
is
a
good
beer
try
one
on
for
size
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
i
thought
it
was
fine
m
sweet
at
the
beginning
turning
slowly
and
really
not
to
much
to
a
bittersweetness
and
at
the
very
end
some
hops
bitter
clear
orangegold
with
a
meager
cap
of
offwhite
foam
that
disappeared
quickly
it
seemed
pretty
lifeless
during
the
pour
caramel
aroma
toasted
malt
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
same
in
the
flavour
which
seemed
a
little
thin
very
low
bitterness
which
made
it
seem
sweeter
than
it
is
quite
toasted
and
bready
finished
with
some
sharp
bitterness
tastes
artificial
medium
to
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
more
astringency
than
i
liked
im
not
a
fan
dr
its
drinkable
enough
but
the
abv
does
come
through
more
than
it
should
and
it
feels
produced
for
the
mass
edit
after
reading
all
the
other
reviews
and
seeing
an
average
of
bs
i
must
be
convinced
that
i
got
a
bad
batch
bottle
maybe
i
will
be
willing
to
revisit
it
maybe
pours
caramel
golden
not
much
head
nose
was
sweet
malt
and
corn
maybe
caramel
on
the
nose
as
well
nothing
special
tasted
like
it
smelled
flavor
is
decent
just
not
great
sweet
but
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
burns
my
stomach
on
the
way
down
not
bad
for
a
buck
drinkable
overall
a
decent
version
of
a
bock
light
but
tasty
trader
joes
hofbrau
bock
is
a
fair
attempt
at
the
bock
style
coupled
with
being
less
than
a
buck
a
bottle
this
is
one
to
try
t
this
isnt
a
particularly
offensive
tasting
beer
nor
is
it
particularly
good
tasting
i
get
some
light
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
of
subdued
grassy
hops
its
not
the
first
beer
i
would
go
for
but
you
could
certainly
do
worse
also
the
sausages
trader
joes
makes
with
this
beer
are
killer
drinkability
pretty
decent
except
for
the
headache
it
is
giving
me
maybe
that
has
more
to
do
with
the
four
beers
i
had
earlier
d
alright
but
theres
some
alcohol
bite
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
clumpy
white
head
the
aroma
that
this
brew
gives
off
is
of
some
fresh
malts
and
just
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
weak
i
thought
mostly
a
hefty
amount
of
malts
with
not
much
else
to
back
it
up
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
very
drinkable
and
on
the
lighter
side
its
a
decent
brew
but
its
just
not
for
me
trader
joes
is
a
pretty
good
place
to

youre
on

budget

is
an
excellent
example
if
youre
a

its

even
if
you
arent
poured

not
much
on

some

nothing

this
one
isnt

not

goes

1

2
would
be
enough
in

sitting
i
would
score
this
better
on

the
flavors
are
so
strong
i
am
not
to
eager
to

not
my

for

it

a

in

i
think
it
could
be
approved
in
every
category
if
it
just
had
some
better

has
a

filtered
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
half
inch
of
white

that
settles
to
a
fine
froth
smells
rather
a
lot
like
yuengling
at
first
clean
with
a
few
lagery

notes
but
it
becomes
a
bit
more
hoppy
and
bready
as
it
warms
tastes
clean
and
malty
a
bit
minerally
with
toasted
and
biscuity
notes
while
the
hops
bring
a
sturdy
bitterness
and
greenfloral
almost
skunky
flavors
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
highlycarbonated
and
it
fills
out
quickly
the
label
describes
it
as
a
traditional
bock
but
its
light
color
and
prominent
hoppiness
makes
it
more
like
a
hellesbock
and
i
judged
it
as
such
for
the
price
this
is
a
great
beer

is

pleasantly

and

at

a

on

side
for

it

dont

what
exactly
to

here
overall
a

the
feel

it
is

offputting
give
it
a
try
though
decent

for
6
bucks
a
six
though
i
enjoyed
the

more

i
found
this
one
to
hit
the

not
push
them
a
good
beer
to

for

12
oz

from
trader
joes
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
practically
not
existent
head
light
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
and
piney
hops
medium
body
quite
tangy
and
reach
flavor
is
dominated
by
piney
earthy
hops
balanced
by
caramel
malt
finish
is
long
and
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
as
with
most
tjs
products
good
beer
for
the
price
my
first
trader
joes
beer
it
pours
a
clear
straight
amber
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
orange
peel
flowers
wheat
buttery
biscuits
and
rye
bread
the
taste
doesnt
stray
too
far
from
this
formula
with
the
orange
coming
through
a
bit
more
joined
by
a
sorta
cloveish
flavor
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
very
fluid
feel
overall
a
bit
on
the
flimsy
side
but
a
pretty
decent
and
drinkable
beer
full
bodied
taste
a
little
bland
the
aroma
made
me
think
this
would
be
super
dry
and
relatively
hoppy
for
style
but
instead
it
tasted
like
it
had
diminished
carbonation
and
by
virtue
any
of
the
prickly
hop
spice
feel
youll
get
in
a
good
version
of
this
style
good
price
on
this
stuff
though
this
beer
pours
a
very
attractive
dark
golden
tan
with
plenty
of
head
and
some
lovely
lace
good
carbonation
a
very
pleasant
sweet
malty
aroma
taste
is
a
little
grassy
hops
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
and
a
little
alcohol
kick
at
the
end
very
well
done
for
a
beer
that
is
7
abv
and
only
5
99six
overall
this
might
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
and
unobjectionable
i
imagine
that
anyone
who
likes
beer
would
like
this
one
and
im
not
sure
of
many
other
beers
that
are
this
good
with
such
a
cheap
price
tag
no
middle
man
no
jacked
up
price
and
a
solid
drinkable
beer
b
bought
a
sixer
will
be
my
last
i
think
too
bad
because
tjs
does
rebottle
some
excellent
singlemalt
so
i
was
hoping
they
could
do
the
same
with
beers
overall
fairly
drinkable
but
can
become
cloying
it
looks
good
tastes
good
but
isnt
exactly
lively
this
beer
pours
with
a
slightly
deep
golden
color
with
a
constant
stream
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
foam
which
recedes
quickly
leaves
a
surprisingly
nice
lacing
pattern
the
aroma
is
lacking
a
bit
if
you
try
real
hard
you
can
detect
notes
of
clover
and
honey
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
drinking
beer
that
has
a
slight
hop
character
at
the
front
and
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
but
both
are
so
toned
down
that
neither
flavor
comes
out
that
much
overall
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
there
are
definitely
better
ones
out
there
for
5
99
7
abv
a
damn
good
beer
great
to
bring
to
a
party
easy
to
drink
big
bang
for
your
buck
goes
down
smooth
doesnt
hold
up
to
other
helles
i
have
had
but
once
again
for
the
price
the
drinking
is
good
but
this
hides
a
7
abv
almost
better
than
anything
ive
ever
had
feels
more
like
a
light
lager
than
a
bock
but
still
has
the
taste
qualities
to
it
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
this
really
isnt
the
best
beer
out
there
let
alone
the
best
beer
of
its
style
that
said
my
sixer
was
only
5
99
so
this
makes
an
excellent
choice
for
a
good
beer
to
have
around
at
a
very
affordable
price
especially
for
its
7
abv
i
wouldnt
buy
this
normally
but
this
is
a
beer
id
definitely
be
willing
to
drink
again
on
a
budget
i
got
this
because
our
store
does
not
carry
teh
fat
weasel
anymore
i
was
please
with
the
bock
as
replacement
to
the
weasel
it
comes
with
a
full
flaver
and
a
strong
taste
its
a
big
bear
for
the
price
of
6
99
a
sixpack
ill
continue
to
pick
it
up
frequently
and
enjoy
it
year
around
a
little
light
in
the
flavor
department
but
overall
not
a
bad
maibock
poured
golden
with
a
touch
of
amber
slightly
sweet
grain
notes
in
the
aroma
up
front
also
a
bit
of
sweet
grain
quickly
followed
by
moderately
roasted
caramel
flavor
finish
was
clean
with
some
residual
bitterness
the
7
abv
was
well
integrated
with
no
etoh
notes
drinkability
not
too
bad
overall
if
you
go
in
open
minded
you
probably
wont
be
disappointed
if
youre
expecting
a
bock
youll
definitely
be
a
bit
upset
for
5
99
a
sixer
it
works
though
especially
great
if
you
cook
up
some
of
the
bratwurst
that
tjs
makes
with
this
beer
md
interesting
taste
malt
with
a
sweet
citrus
taste
but
mixed
caramel
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
one
again
but
it
was
worth
trying
and
recommend
it
drinkability
is
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
two
which
i
dont
usually
do
for
beers
over
6
the
sweetness
is
not
prohibitive
another
value
man
not
my
favorite
trader
joes
beer
not
by
a
longshot
but
it
does
have
a
fairly
strong
hop
presence
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
due
to
its
easy
nature
light
bock
color
golden
amber
with
enough
head
retention
and
lacing
to
momentarily
satisfy
me
if
not
blow
my
socks
off
sweet
honeylike
aroma
with
hoppy
notes
of
the
most
nectarlike
floral
variety
clean
and
a
bit
light
if
not
exactly
subdued
the
flavor
is
again
quite
sweet
but
lightly
so
rather
than
being
syrupy
and
full
pretty
malty
overall
with
the
hops
still
quite
floral
a
little
spicy
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
grassy
undertone
add
some
color
light
in
the
mouth
clean
in
the
finish
not
quite
dry
but
highly
carbonated
so
theres
not
much
afterflavor
in
general
a
little
light
and
tending
towards
drinkability
in
favor
of
challenging
not
a
bad
thing
and
for
the
price
i
expect
nothing
less
or
more
as
it
were
decent
choice
for
a
party
or
when
youre
feeling
like
a
bock
but
want
to
knock
a
couple
back
a
good
beer
not
overwhelming
but
certainly
quite
drinkable
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
clean
true
to
style
malty
yet
nicely
hop
balanced
makes
me
look
forward
to
spring
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
big
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
are
very
sweet
with
lots
of
grass
but
also
too
much
alcohol
the
flavors
are
all
caramel
with
a
faint
toastiness
the
alcohol
really
detracts
from
the
taste
it
is
not
bad
but
im
not
a
fan
taste
a
slight
honey
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
grain
followed
by
dry
resinous
hop
bitterness
like
most
of
the
beers
from
trader
joes
there
is
nothing
bad
here
i
just
wish
there
was
more
of
the
good
stuff
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
light
copper
color
with
a
decentsized
head
that
fizzles
out
too
quickly
cereal
grain
aroma
with
some
hearty
bread
and
maybe
some
caramel
good
but
a
bit
muted
a
little
corny
in
flavor
but
mainly
grains
and
a
light
toffee
sweetness
vague
earthiness
must
be
hops
very
low
bitterness
but
its
there
if
you
look
hard
enough
body
is
thin
for
the
style
almost
closer
to
pilsener
than
bock
medium
carbonation
slightly
astringentmetallic
finish
not
awful
but
ill
reach
for
a
german
bock
every
time
even
if
its
had
to
suffer
through
overseas
transport
and
millennia
on
a
bevmo
shelf
pours
a
clear
filtered
golden
body
along
with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
sheet
of
lacing
the
aromas
are
strong
fruity
characteristics
of
apples
along
with
a
maltiness
and
german
spice
hop
kick
the
flavors
are
sweet
pale
malt
along
with
a
slight
apple
fruit
character
the
hops
clean
it
all
up
and
bring
it
together
rather
well
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
creamy
and
tasty
at
7
this
is
a
rather
tasty
bock
that
is
right
up
my
alley
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
head
quickly
disappeared
to
almost
nothing
the
nose
was
sweet
caramel
malts
citrus
fruits
and
yeast
very
sweet
up
front
with
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
honey
and
a
light
bitter
finish
that
ends
quickly
the
body
was
light
medium
and
carbonated
well
which
made
for
a
very
light
drinkable
bock
overall
very
average
one
bottle
of
a
mixed
sixer
i
received
from
my
parents
for
my
26th
birthday
medium
chewy
mouthfeel
sits
on
the
palate
with
ample
carbonation
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
fine
offering
from
trader
joes
this
is
the
first
tjs
beer
ive
tried
and
im
curious
to
see
how
the
other
styles
fare
overall
not
too
shabby
a
brew
the
price
cant
be
beat
for
the
product
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
grain
flavor
segue
to
a
spicy
finish
slightly
rich
and
buttery
in
body
from
a
robust
amount
of
malts
decent
lingering
malt
finish
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
for
the
rich
body
of
the
beer
bit
narrow
in
the
complexity
department
makes
for
an
average
drinkability
d
7
abv
is
a
good
level
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
considering
the
source
and
the
price
its
not
too
bad
but
not
worth
seeking
out
however
its
a
decent
sipper
and
i
am
glad
that
trader
joes
made
it
at
the
appropriate
high
abv
d
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
i
slightly
better
than
average
beer
but
for
the
price
im
not
complaining
i
got
what
i
expected
and
paid
the
appropriate
price
as
well
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
these
trader
joes
beers
at
the
price
theyre
nice
everyday
beers
i
quite
often
go
to
the
fridge
and
find
only
beers
that
i
want
to
hang
onto
for
a
tasting
or
more
basic
stuff
that
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
up
steps
joe
and
theyre
great
for
taking
to
parties
where
you
never
know
what
youll
find
and
they
make
great
intro
beers
for
the
noninitiated
as
well
but
ok
the
hofbrau
bock
pours
a
deep
amber
with
golden
highlights
itd
be
nice
if
it
was
a
little
darker
but
it
certainly
fits
the
style
as
is
the
aroma
is
restrained
and
clean
only
revealing
a
hint
of
honeyish
malt
and
a
suggestion
of
floral
and
grassy
hops
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
fuller
of
course
and
the
maltiness
is
like
honeydrizzled
bread
it
opens
up
as
it
warms
and
the
toastiness
really
becomes
apparent
in
the
finish
its
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
along
with
the
alcohol
it
finishes
dry
and
spicy
with
spicy
and
gently
grassy
hops
swirling
here
and
there
as
it
slowly
fades
could
it
be
better
yes
a
bit
more
malt
girth
at
the
center
would
really
help
to
focus
it
and
then
round
out
the
overall
flavor
but
as
it
is
its
still
a
really
nice
balanced
and
flavorful
bock
i
wont
say
i
could
drink
50
of
these
because
we
all
know
what
50
eggs
did
to
cool
hand
luke
but
i
could
easily
drink
3
and
maybe
4
of
these
in
a
night
so
overall
not
great
but
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
from
trader
joes
it
is
not
a
bad
deal
for
a
buck
a
bottle
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
tjs
beer
and
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
quite
refreshing
and
a
nice
deal
5
99sixer
sweet
with
some
cleansing
bitterness
and
unexpected
carbonation
all
i
can
muster
is
candy
corn
maybe
some
factory
made
square
caramel
candy
if
you
close
your
eyes
and
free
associate
some
type
of
hops
are
in
there
giving
it
some
german
credbility
but
ultimately
its
kind
of
flaccid
pretty
dull
candy
flavored
alcohol
delivery
device
clear
gold
under
a
good
sized
creamy
head
smells
bocky
clean
toasted
malts
sweet
bread
and
some
grassy
spice
from
the
hops
rich
toasted
malts
upfront
in
the
flavor
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
quite
sweet
which
could
turn
some
people
off
medium
bodied
with
some
texture
to
it
maybe
even
a
little
chewy
certainly
a
perfectly
good
interpretation
of
a
standard
bock
overall
this
was
not
very
complex
but
it
was
very
good
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
for
this
one
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
bock
and
i
will
buy
this
one
again
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
bock
or
maibock
interesting
enough
as
it
rest
in
the
nowhere
land
between
the
two
dnice
and
drinkable
not
too
heavy
but
the
alcohol
will
probably
get
to
you
a
bit
faster
than
normal
d
not
a
good
pick
if
youre
at
tjs
unless
you
are
looking
for
abv
at
the
expense
of
flavor
drinkability
not
the
full
bodied
well
caramelized
malt
bomb
i
was
expecting
drinkable
but
not
worthy
of
another
visit
drinkability
doesnt
taste
bad
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
short
head
and
poor
retention
theres
little
to
no
lacing
present
smells
of
a
lager
with
a
slight
wheat
smell
fits
the
bock
style
fairly
well
though
not
very
dark
at
all
a
smooth
flavor
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
very
low
carbonation
overall
not
too
bad
im
not
a
big
lager
or
bock
fan
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
pours
clear
yellowgold
white
head
of
large
bubbles
two
fingers
high
head
lays
down
fairly
quickly
leaving
just
a
touch
of
lacing
on
sides
of
glass
and
surface
of
beer
some
aroma
of
cloves
malt
and
citrus
initial
taste
holds
no
smoke
or
grassiness
some
malt
but
not
sweet
some
crisp
carbonated
bite
a
little
cloves
and
allspice
on
the
finish
overall
a
wellcrafted
flavorful
brew
the
taste
is
also
definitely
in
character
for
a
strong
lagerpale
bock
but
just
on
the
lower
rougher
end
of
the
spectrum
and
closer
to
some
higher
abv
malt
liquors
like
steel
reserve
its
a
bit
rough
sweet
raisinygrapey
with
old
musty
fruit
some
meaty
grain
its
a
bit
sweet
but
then
rough
biting
spicey
alcohol
takes
over
a
little
too
much
along
with
cooked
vegetables
and
a
rough
thin
bland
minerally
quality
its
not
bad
but
not
really
good
that
said
my
wife
really
likes
this
and
she
doesnt
like
maibocks
or
other
pale
bocks
or
european
strong
lagers
but
she
does
like
some
malt
liquors
fairly
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
flavor
is
quite
nice
the
caramel
malt
hits
the
tastebuds
first
but
any
sweetness
is
nicely
attentuated
with
hoppiness
and
a
nice
tanginess
long
finish
from
these
lagered
hops
alcohol
is
there
but
not
really
distracting
very
drinkable
a
wellmade
beer
high
abv
for
a
session
beer
but
a
good
brew
for
cold
winter
nights
drinkability
at
7
abv
too
strong
did
not
finish
the
glass
sorry
joe
far
from
complex
this
bock
delivers
fine
flavor
with
an
even
more
delightful
texture
had
i
only
had
sight
and
smell
to
judge
it
by
i
wouldve
written
it
off
as
subpar
but
it
delivers
where
it
counts
most
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
because
this
is
a
keeper
decent
dont
pass
up
t
malty
slightly
sweet
light
bodied
smooth
carbonation
bready
body
with
a
floral
hop
taste
to
balance
the
malt
the
finish
leaves
a
slightly
watery
taste
in
the
mouth
no
strong
alcohol
presence
not
the
best
bock
but
very
drinkable
and
great
purchase
for
the
price
drinkability
after
stockyard
oatmeal
stout
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
trader
joes
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
its
good
and
a
bargain
not
the
bext
example
of
a
bock
d
not
bad
at
all
packs
a
decent
punch
and
has
some
good
flavor
mildly
recommended
cant
beat
the
trader
joes
price
either
of
6
a
sixer
these
days
i
believe
this
is
a
gordon
bierchmade
lager
very
nice
drinkability
could
be
better
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
one
again
clean
pour
fine
aroma
good
tasting
beer
but
nothing
that
stands
out
flavor
is
a
nice
surprise
the
caramel
malt
character
is
nice
and
rich
with
a
pleasant
hop
finish
of
earthy
grass
and
dried
hay
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
little
trace
ot
he
7abv
tastes
relatively
authentic
in
terms
of
style
and
a
great
beer
for
5
a
sixpack
i
dont
see
too
many
straight
up
bocks
around
so
this
was
a
sure
pick
for
me
the
other
night
pours
a
very
good
looking
gold
color
with
a
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
has
lager
written
all
over
it
taste
is
crisp
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
grain
husk
to
boot
mouthfeel
was
a
good
balance
between
hops
and
malt
maintaining
carbonation
all
the
while
alcohol
is
not
evident
at
all
on
this
one
despite
the
7
the
six
pack
of
this
lasted
me
two
nights
not
exactly
awe
struck
by
this
beer
but
impressed
there
should
be
more
bocks
around
cheers
well
holy
crap
trader
joes
sharts
out
another
good
call
im
a
fan
of
this
golden
lions
mane
colored
brau
it
tastes
like
a
baby
belgian
trippel
and
the
7
2
abv
is
nice
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
putz
about
leaving
you
unfulfilled
and
doesnt
give
you
syrupy
throat
either
great
scott
im
impressed
with
the
sweet
and
subtly
complex
malt
character
i
dont
taste
any
damn
hops
but
at
22
ibus
they
are
doing
their
job
like
a
cool
rhythm
bassist
way
in
the
back
grooving
away
give
it
a
bounce
i
picked
this
up
today
just
for
kicks
there
wasnt
much
of
head
to
speak
of
but
i
did
like
the
dark
gold
color
not
much
hop
smell
on
the
nose
but
there
was
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
the
taste
was
pretty
good
for
a
beer
that
cost
4
99
a
sixer
there
was
a
richness
not
commonly
found
in
other
lagers
especially
domestic
macroes
found
at
this
price
point
the
taste
matched
its
smell
in
that
i
found
a
sweet
malt
flavor
that
finished
with
a
slight
amount
of
hops
it
had
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
and
decent
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
heavy
with
as
noted
by
another
reviewer
a
syrup
consistency
however
i
liked
this
beer
the
price
really
helped
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
it
all
day
its
not
one
of
the
most
masterful
micros
but
i
havent
had
many
sub
1bottle
beers
with
this
caliber
of
brewing
moderate
carbonation
reasonably
crisp
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
but
sweetness
and
a
moderate
lack
of
balance
would
limit
this
to
one
not
a
terrible
dinner
brew
certainly
interesting
for
the
price
this
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
smell
is
spices
with
apple
banana
the
taste
is
very
spicy
a
little
alcohol
hint
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
with
a
good
drinkabilty
despite
its
high
abv
d
easy
i
guess
a
little
pilsner
a
little
malt
liquor
not
much
bock
okay
maybe
there
is
i
dunno
its
a
decent
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
thin
with
the
beer
being
a
little
flat
however
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
but
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
another
good
value
for
the
money
from
trader
joes
this
beer
pours
a
smart
looking
golden
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
over
time
and
leaves
only
trace
elements
of
the
lacey
stuff
not
a
bad
looking
beer
but
nothing
special
to
see
move
along
the
aroma
is
as
all
good
bocks
should
be
nice
and
malty
this
nose
also
has
some
strong
banana
nut
bread
smells
in
it
as
well
faint
licorice
and
strawberry
scents
waft
in
and
out
accordingly
the
taste
follows
suit
its
faintly
nutty
and
strongly
bananay
with
a
heavy
dose
of
malt
some
undiscernable
spices
make
a
presence
in
the
mouth
as
does
an
applestrawberry
tribute
finishes
slightly
hoppy
with
a
mildly
acidic
bitter
aftertaste
im
no
bock
expert
but
this
beer
tastes
okay
to
me
and
even
if
its
not
in
line
with
proper
german
bocks
i
still
admit
to
liking
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
at
times
creamy
with
a
rather
dry
finish
on
the
whole
a
bit
sweet
but
an
overall
drinkable
beer
from
tjs
seems
that
the
more
i
contemplate
and
pay
attention
to
the
flavor
the
less
i
like
this
beer
its
not
bad
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
crude
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
slick
on
the
finish
with
too
much
fizz
up
front
this
is
by
far
the
least
impressive
of
the
tjs
gordon
biersch
brewed
beers
not
very
good
the
beer
pours
a
crisp
dark
yellow
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
has
a
great
maltiness
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
with
sticky
alcohol
this
one
makes
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
and
for
92
cents
a
bottle
its
a
very
decent
brew
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
somewhat
refreshing
beer
that
doesnt
take
a
toll
on
the
stomach
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
sharpness
for
fans
of
the
style
this
one
is
a
decent
example
this
bock
seems
to
be
more
of
the
maibock
variety
with
its
lighter
color
and
higher
abv
pretty
much
as
expected
for
the
style
crisp
grains
light
but
assertive
hop
presence
and
a
little
higher
alcohol
content
as
always
with
trader
joes
beer
the
price
is
right
recommended
hey
nice
surprise
here
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
great
value
too
at
just
a
little
over
5
a
sixer
ill
have
to
try
some
more
of
the
trader
joes
beers
now
recommended
m
starts
with
medium
carbonation
ends
without
any
drinkability
i
like
it
but
as
bocks
go
its
not
quite
sweet
enough
again
considering
the
economics
inloved
here
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
i
can
see
picking
up
a
single
or
two
on
occasion
if
in
the
mood
for
something
cheap
with
a
kick
and
more
drinkable
than
the
fat
weasel
ale
it
is
sold
beside
even
so
this
slides
down
the
throat
faily
nicely
and
is
a
worthy
beer

very

for

a

to

stuff
sensing
the
alcohol
when
the
abv
is
a
middleoftheroad
7
is
a
major
flaw
in
my
opinion
otherwise
its
a
decent
drinker
to
be
honest
though
its
strongest
point
is
how
it
looks
in
the
glass
drinkability
this
is
an
average
example
of
what
is
to
me
an
unappealing
style
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
not
bad
for
a
grocery
house
brand
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
despite
the
initial
smell
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
that
should
go
well
with
a
range
of
foods
crisp
enough
for
summer
enough
alcohol
for
a
cold
winters
night
drinkability
for
the
price
its
worth
a
try
but
i
really
want
trader
joes
to
do
more
with
there
brews
clear
gold
body
nice
looking
fluffy
white
head
this
is
deifinitely
more
like
a
maibock
with
the
light
colored
body
and
spicy
alcohol
and
malt
not
much
more
than
a
light
graininess
on
the
nose
this
is
along
the
quality
of
the
other
tjs
offerings
not
bad
but
not
that
great
either
some
spiciness
but
not
really
the
full
experience
you
want
with
the
style
decent
maibock
reminds
me
some
fo
the
summit
maibock
definitely
worth
the
low
price
clear
light
golden
slight
wispy
white
head
moderate
lace
light
malts
sweet
aroma
overall
not
much
hop
presence
but
thats
o
k
would
like
some
more
bready
malt
aromas
though
taste
starts
with
light
caramel
malts
and
a
hay
like
accent
nothing
special
here
but
nothing
bad
either
the
mouthfeel
is
agreeable
enough
lightly
carbonated
mediumfull
obdy
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
malty
as
i
like
my
maibocks
average
beer
here
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
golden
and
clear
with
a
small
white
head
which
goes
away
fast
not
much
lacing
it
smells
sweet
mainly
like
grainbread
with
a
small
bit
of
citrus
the
first
taste
is
of
grain
but
theres
a
good
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
with
a
slight
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
drinkable
but
i
just
wish
it
had
a
stronger
taste
to
it
i
could
drink
this
now
and
again
and
for
the
price
its
a
good
deal
but
overall
its
a
little
above
average
nothing
great
pours
a
very
bright
golden
amber
hue
with
lazy
bubbling
the
aroma
starts
out
a
very
veryy
bready
malt
when
its
cool
the
aroma
gets
a
tit
finky
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
a
light
toasted
malt
mixed
with
subtle
german
hops
the
palate
is
very
clean
but
not
refreshing
although
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
good
lingering
flavor
of
toast
and
candi
sugar
at
4
99
a
6
pack
this
is
a
great
beer
sure
there
are
better
bocks
out
there
but
this
one
is
good
enough
and
really
affordable
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
trader
joesgordon
biersch
line
pretty
typical
from
my
experiences
with
trader
joe
beers
pours
pale
goldenorange
with
a
medium
thick
bone
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
musty
with
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
mediumbodied
and
clean
with
sweet
malt
flavoring
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
hops
in
the
background
lingering
spicy
hops
aftertaste
keeps
the
malty
flavor
from
becoming
cloying
yet
overall
this
brew
is
not
quite
balanced
enough
to
be
an
enjoyable
session
beer
just
a
little
below
average
but
worth
the
roughly
83
cents
per
bottle
it
does
leave
you
with
a
nice
warming
glow
after
you
swallow
notes
for
a
trader
joes
beer
this
was
one
of
the
better
products
ive
had
for
the
price
this
is
ok
and
when
in
a
pinch
i
would
consider
it
again
for
now
im
out
this
was
a
very
clean
beer
it
was
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
a
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
from
trader
joes
i
would
buy
a
six
it
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
head
of
foam
that
was
about
1in
in
height
the
head
receded
fast
but
just
a
little
skim
of
foam
still
remained
during
the
entire
duration
of
drinking
the
aroma
was
kind
of
grassy
with
fruits
hops
and
some
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
was
about
above
average
not
too
complex
but
still
had
plenty
of
flavor
what
i
could
detect
was
a
moderate
hoppy
taste
up
front
and
with
a
slight
malty
aftertaste
at
the
end
nothing
too
special
with
the
mouthfeel
except
for
the
usual
light
carbonated
bitter
and
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
while
this
may
not
be
the
brew
of
royalty
to
me
this
did
make
a
nice
affordable
beer
that
would
come
through
for
me
if
nothing
else
was
available
a
bottle
my
wife
picked
up
at
trader
joes
in
chicago
pours
golden
to
yellow
big
rising
bubbles
quarter
inch
head
gone
in
less
than
a
minute
good
lacing
all
around
nice
looking
beer
odor
is
not
so
good
slightly
skunky
smell
some
hops
my
wife
said
it
vaguely
smells
like
beer
wheaty
biscuity
flavor
reminded
me
of
sour
oranges
kind
of
like
a
hefe
that
died
before
adulthood
hoppy
aftertaste
pretty
smooth
with
a
tiny
bite
this
would
be
too
weird
to
drink
all
the
time
not
the
best
ive
had
from
tjs
yet
again
another
solid
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
at
your
local
trader
joes
d
this
beer
is
not
half
bad
quite
a
deal
5
29
a
sixpack
nothing
earth
shattering
but
certainly
worth
the
try
a
good
beer
to
mix
things
up
a
bit
but
not
something
id
stick
to
all
night
wellbalanced
and
fairly
straightforward
there
is
definately
a
good
bit
of
malt
in
here
but
its
not
exactly
the
most
exciting
malt
profile
ive
ever
tasted
if
im
going
to
pummel
my
liver
with
higher
abv
beers
id
rather
do
it
with
something
that
has
a
bit
more
panache
drinkability
the
more
i
drink
the
more
syrupy
this
gets
still
these
go
down
pretty
easy
especially
if
i
had
some
buttered
bread
andor
bratwurst
to
go
with
it
drinkability

this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
have
again
and
its
superbly
priced
for
its
quality
light
amber
colour
with
very
little
head
smells
like
a
pilsner
infused
with
brown
sugar
that
might
sound
like
a
nasty
clash
but
it
doesnt
make
me
wince
very
slightly
yeasty
taste
gives
way
to
a
rich
malty
flavour
backed
with
a
suitably
tangy
hop
profile
this
brew
isnt
outstanding
but
it
is
certainly
well
balanced
the
7
abv
is
not
particularly
apparent
this
is
much
better
stuff
than
the
shiner
which
texans
are
apt
to
wax
lyrical
about
this
is
a
good
beer
should
it
be
called
a
bock
no
not
even
close
blond
bock
yes
that
would
be
a
more
accurate
description
of
this
brew
poured
out
to
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
foam
head
medium
level
of
carbonation
some
lacing
noted
in
the
glass
aromas
of
fresh
malts
and
grain
with
some
toastiness
nice
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
as
the
aroma
very
straightforward
flavors
of
malt
hops
grain
and
some
unsweetbutterscotch
aftertaste
was
smooth
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
quite
enjoyable
a
good
level
of
drinkability
this
could
be
a
fallback
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
for
bmc
drinkers
who
frequent
your
home
to
introduce
them
to
good
beer
yet
keeping
the
duvel
and
such
from
being
wasted
on
those
who
wouldnt
appreciate
it
hell
id
keep
it
in
the
fridge
for
myself
recommended
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
i
was
not
impressed
this
is
a
belowaverage
bock
its
taste
does
nothing
to
encourage
me
to
buy
another
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
but
for
me
nearly
an
impossible
beer
to
enjoy
drinkability
and
notes

very
drinkable
because
of
the
balance
mouthfeel
and
the
very
cheap
price
at
4
99
for
a
sixer
its
one
of
the
better
cheap
beers
out
there
definitely
a
good
beer
when
you
want
solid
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
not
bad
for
what
could
be
perceived
as
a
budget
brew
paid
5
49
for
a
sixpack
a
golden
colored
beer
that
pours
with
a
frothy
white
foam
that
rises
up
and
lingers
a
crisp
malt
aroma
is
followed
by
a
crisp
malt
flavor
a
little
sweet
perhaps
but
this
is
a
bock
and
i
found
it
to
have
just
the
right
bitterness
sure
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
not
very
complex
but
this
sample
was
fresh
and
hit
the
spot
on
cool
spring
evening
and
was
extra
tasty
from
a
ceramic
stein
but
then
again
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
blonde
maibocks
this
time
of
year
hofbrau
was
maybe
not
as
good
as
summit
or
others
ive
tried
but
was
rather
satisfying
not
bad
really
quite
drinkable
though
not
a
great
bock
this
beer
pours
a
rusty
orange
color
with
a
very
small
flimsy
airy
white
head
that
fades
abruptly
looks
low
on
carbonation
and
tastes
low
as
well
aroma
is
grassy
slightly
floral
and
somewhat
spicy
and
toasted
not
bad
but
a
little
weak
taste
has
more
toasted
sweet
malts
and
less
floral
hop
flavor
the
hops
that
were
there
in
the
aroma
seem
lost
in
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
im
only
really
getting
toasted
honeyish
flavors
and
a
little
breadiness
not
bad
but
not
great
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
this
beer
needs
more
liveliness
still
its
really
smooth
and
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
finish
leans
towards
cloying
still
not
terrible
but
not
too
great
either
good
for
its
price
for
the
abv
there
is
little
alcohol
profile
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
at
the
price
this
is
the
best
of
the
tj
values
drinkability
fairly
impressed
with
this
one
but
not
as
a
bock
good
sample
brew
pours
a
full
clear
gold
color
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
thin
tan
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
is
grainy
smelling
and
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
aroma
is
pretty
subdued
and
because
of
that
fairly
disappointing
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
solid
sweet
malt
taste
that
has
a
hint
of
toffee
to
it
there
is
perhaps
a
hint
of
spicy
hop
notes
here
in
the
flavor
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
clearly
a
well
made
beer
but
it
just
is
lacking
in
flavor
and
depth
overall
7
mgd
drinkability
is
satisfactory
overall
this
was
a
step
up
over
the
others
on
the
tjs
line
though
not
by
much
hofbrau
bock
falls
into
the
range
of
a
decent
brews
that
make
it
into
my
take
it
or
leave
it
group
overall
one
of
the
worst
beers
produced
by
trader
joes
that
ive
tasted
so
far
drinkability
excellent
accompaniment
to
anything
that
comes
with
a
super
bowl
spread
hot
wings
hoggies
chips
even
carrots
and
ranch
dip
but
be
warry
of
heavily
spiced
food
with
this
one
italian
indian
and
some
mexican
as
well
as
spicey
food
that
is
heavy
sorry
carnitas
youre
out
with
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
i
suspect
that
this
is
gordon
biersch
blond
bock
relabeled
overall
the
last
of
the
four
trader
joes
brewing
co
beers
that
i
picked
up
last
week
out
of
the
four
the
other
three
were
bohemian
lager
bavarian
hefeweizen
and
vienna
lager
this
is
the
strongest
and
perhaps
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
think
i
liked
this
one
a
bit
better
out
of
the
bottle
where
it
seemed
maltier
overall
impression
nice
drinkable
beer
nothing
thrilling
about
it
but
for
the
price
4
99
at
trader
joes
this
is
a
good
everyday
offering
sweet
biscuits
and
floral
hops
a
deliciously
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
hard
to
beat
the
value
at
only
5
99
for
a
sixer
of
this
at
trader
joes
maibocks
are
underappreciated
in
general
i
believe
and
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
style
that
is
highly
drinkable
and
great
with
most
food
theres
a
rich
caramel
dominant
aroma
with
some
dark
chocolate
roast
notes
on
the
back
end
a
touch
of
bitterness
gives
a
kick
to
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
body
i
liked
this
more
than
i
had
expected
to
feels
heavy
and
filling
but
you
dont
taste
the
alcohol
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
but
it
still
had
some
aspects
that
i
found
to
not
be
that
inline
with
the
style
but
they
werent
too
overpowering
so
it
was
still
identifiable
as
a
maibock
and
in
the
end
i
liked
it
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
its
smooth
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
a
little
crisp
slightly
filling
and
the
taste
does
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
after
that
the
sweetness
might
start
to
be
too
much
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
was
still
fairly
true
to
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
it
could
use
a
little
work
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
couldnt
find
the
maibocks
that
i
like
more
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
great
maibock
but
i
think
its
still
worth
trying
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
it
just
had
a
few
things
that
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
this
isnt
my
favorite
trade
joe
beer
and
its
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
maibock
especially
for
the
price
keep
it
up
taste
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
figs
quite
sweet
rjt
pours
a
clear
caramel
color
smell
is
all
hops
taste
is
more
complex
than
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
feels
like
a
lager
but
the
rich
malt
and
hop
presence
make
it
feel
like
a
red
ale
at
7
3
it
is
a
little
on
the
strong
side
for
a
lager
its
a
good
quality
beer
but
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
overall
a
decent
maibock
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
but
definitely
one
of
the
best
for
this
price
i
would
buy
again
just
based
on
pricing
not
a
great
maibock
but
a
decent
beer

among

something

this

delivers
ive
tried
dozens
of
maibocks
and
have
never
been
particularly
impressed
by
the
style
this
one
delivers
go
out
and
pick
up
a
bottle
o
id
like
to
thank
tjs
for
bringing
gordonbiersch
beers
to
the
areas
where
it
isnt
distributed
and
thank
gb
for
teaming
with
tjs
to
package
and
sell
their
beers
at
such
a
bargain
while
the
alcohol
tends
this
beer
to
some
hotness
that
is
a
little
distracting
this
is
yet
another
terrific

beer
from
gb
and

i
had
a
lengthy
review
typed
out
and
it
got
deleted
maybe
later
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
maibock
beer
style
but
i
definitely
would
recommend
this
beer

oh
for
goodness
sake
who
ever
has
a
minimum
character
requirement
ok
ill
blather
on
for
a
bit
before
i
get
to
the
point
namely
to
say
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tasted
true
maibock
since
i
visited
heidelberg
for
prof
zu
putlitz
70th
birthday
symposium
in
iirc
1990
high
c
the
taste
has
an
intense
malty
sweetness
up
front
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
over
the
top
with
the
slightest
of
low
hop
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
i
mean
i
could
drink
this
again
because
it
does
have
some
interesting
characteristics
but
it
really
is
maltheavy
and
maltforward
overall
a
nice
big
seasonal
lager
big
malt
big
hops
criminally
cheap
at
6six
pack
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
brew
at
an
unbelievable
price
o
a
truly
nice
bock
beer
enjoyable
to
drink
and
unique
enough
to
trip
up
palate
this
is
a
great
addition
to
a
craft
pack
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
several
of
o
a
solid
example
of
the
style
the
price
is
really
good
as
it
tends
to
be
with
trader
joes
beers
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
lots
of
sweet
malt
this
has
an
underlying
sugary
sensation
and
a
peculiar
resiny
gunky
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
tastes
like
some
sort
of
weird
candy
some
roast
malt
with
a
frozen
apple
juice
concentrate
flavor
the
initial
taste
is
not
bad
but
that
long
candy
apple
flavor
is
more
than
i

is
a
rather
disappointing
beer
the
alcohol
overpowered
the
other
flavors
the
warmth
diminished
most
of
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
there
was
a
very
odd
grainy
character
throughout
that
i
felt
was
out
of
place
still
its
foothills
and
ill
try
everything
from
them
i
can
d
a
solid
drinkable
maibock
served
from
tap
into
a
standard
pint
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
evident
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
fruit
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
malt
bananas
buiscuit
citrus
and
alcohol
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
the
flavor
and
aroma
was
of
this
one
were
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
of
brew
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
get
your
hands
on
it
great
beer
but
not
really
aligned
with
the
style
due
to
the
sweetermaltier
taste
reviewed
on
06222009
i
had
this
on
draft
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
predominantly
caramel
malt
with
a
sweet
finish
pretty
decent
and
a
refreshing
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
maibock
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
bubbly
but
not
overly
so
classic
foothills
this
beer
is
hot
huge
alcohol
presence
that
masks
most
all
flavors
im
getting
some
faint
grainy
biscuits
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
but
this
is
all
booze
the
8
is
not
hidden
well
theres
a
drying
sweetness
that
coats
the
mouth
at
the
end
as
well
this
is
different
and
not
what
i
expected
with
such
high
alcohol
this
is
one
and
done
for
me
update
i
wont
order
this
again
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
gets
way
to
be
way
too
much
in
a
harsh
way
down
this
while
its
ice
cold
and
call
it
a
night
a
good
effort
here
from
foothills
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
it
went
very
well
with
a
burger
golden
pour
with
nice
fluffy
head
gives
way
to
thin
wispy
lace
pear
green
apple
and
some
bubble
gum
aromas
blend
with
caramel
and
toffe
malts
all
the
same
flavors
along
with
some
clove
bannana
and
some
spicy
ethanol
a
kiss
of
honey
like
flavor
lingers
on
the
finish
hops
riding
way
back
are
there
just
to
keep
the
sweet
malts
from
becomming
cloying
some
light
ethanol
warming
felt
in
the
throat
by
mid
glass
other
wise
the
8
is
fairly
well
integrated
here
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
nice
easy
drinker
proceed
with
caution
well
done
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
medium
cream
white
head
and
light
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
rather
light
but
not
offensive
grains
light
tart
fruits
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
grainy
lager
type
scent
was
most
apparent
taste
expands
on
the
subtleties
i
found
in
the
nose
good
fruit
flavors
with
light
tartness
a
bready
dough
flavor
soaked
in
toffee
and
a
touch
of
caramel
earthy
hops
and
grain
with
little
dryness
nice
mouthfeel
very
silky
smooth
and
almost
creamy
clean
and
a
little
crisp
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
drinker
its
tasty
just
doesnt
quite
compare
to
the
smutty
version
i
had
a
couple
weeks
ago
its
good
its
drinkable
its
also
a
style
im
not
familiar
with
and
probably
dont
fully
appreciate
after
a
disappointing
sample
at
the
world
beer
fest
in
april
i
hoped
to
opportunity
to
try
this
at
flying
saucer
would
be
a
better
experience
i
was
wrong
the
beer
was
served
with
no
head
whatsoever
it
could
have
been
iced
tea
for
all
i
knew
the
aroma
was
rather
weak
but
present
some
malts
the
taste
was
just
off
from
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
and
the
alcohol
only
makes
it
harder
to
drink
this
one
was
a
huge
disappointment
and
is
a
far
cry
from
what
i
expect
out
of
foothills
now
most
would
agree
that
rogue
dead
guy
is
the
the
reigning
king
of
the
maibock
style
by
virtue
of
sheer
ubiquitousness
so
the
question
is
is
gruffmeister
better
than
dead
guy
id
have
to
do
more
tasting
to
be
sure
but
my
first
impression
is
yes
and
thats
no
small
feat
for
an
upandcoming
3
year
old
brewery
from
north
carolina
gruffmeister
is
a
flavorful
rich
beer
and
a
superb
example
of
the
style
which
deserves
a
much
wider
following
come
to
north
carolina
and
give
it
a
try
had
this
on
tap
at
the
melllow
mushroom
in
asheville
over
the
weekend
the
seasonal
foothills
still
on
tap
there
for
spring
poured
a
deep
dark
amber
very
clear
with
lots
of
streaming
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
no
head
slight
amount
of
lace
smell
was
very
bready
and
grain
like
with
a
hint
of
a
slight
bitterness
but
definatly
bread
like
the
flavor
followed
suit
as
it
was
highly
malted
and
full
of
grain
like
flavors
not
much
hops
to
balance
but
ever
so
slightly
dry
finish
kinda
thin
in
feel
not
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
that
silky
smooth
feel
overall
this
was
a
decent
offering
from
foothills
and
an
average
representation
of
the
style
the
alcohol
is
very
i
mean
very
well
hidden
i
could
swear
this
was
a
4
beer
was
shocked
to
see
it
at
8
before
my
review
overall
definatly
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
can
drinkability
superbly
refreshing
and
very
wellbalanced
one
of
the
best
craft
brew
takes
on
a
maibock
that
i
have
tasted
really
hits
the
style
and
avoids
some
of
the
phenolic
elements
that
have
disappointed
me
about
other
craft
brewed
maibocks
notes
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
that
really
shouldnt
be
consumed
in
sessions
the
only
giveaway
for
me
that
gruffmeister
was
8
abv
before
i
saw
the
official
name
that
is
was
the
slight
hints
of
alchol
in
the
nose
way
too
drinkable
for
8
not
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
extremely
drinkable
for
an
8
brew
thick
and
creamy
yet
crisp
and
wonderful
just
dont
think
too
deeply
about
it
and
youll
be
quite
content
immensely
quaffable
this
beer
was
a
slightly
golden
amber
color
not
much
smell
the
taste
was
like
a
lightly
hopped
light
beer
a
little
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
was
the
only
high
point
for
this
beer
it
was
fairly
smooth
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
if
there
was
other
choices
clean
and
crisp
medium
body
a
nice
beer
maibock
is
a
unique
style
that
i
really
enjoy
this
one
is
pretty
good
compared
to
others
i
have
had
but
certainly
not
the
best
nice
to
drink
a
good
mai
bock
because
they
are
so
hard
to
findpoured
a
deep
bronze
with
a
small
but
swell
sustained
white
head
big
alcoholic
aromas
with
a
apple
cider

this
is
a
true
mai
bock
by
all
sences
malty
fruit
steeped
in

but
not
overly
so
very
smooth
going
down

the

comes
in

tonight
in

glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
a
beer
from
this
brewer
which
i
doubt
i
will
see
for
a
long
time
if
ever
would
love
to
try
more
poured
from
a
cork
and
cage
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
maize
gold
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
a
ton
of
carbonation
in
a
furious
flow
up
the
glass
constantly
feeding
a
bubbly
white
head
that
doesnt
appear
to
be
going
anywhere
aromas
of
toasted
grains
subtle
hints
of
honey
and
caramel
floral
highlights
and
a
subtle
hops
bitterness
flavors
are
tangy
sweet
forward
almost
sugary
to
start
with
a
rich
honey
and
extremely
bitter
vegetalgrassy
blend
which
lays
on
top
of
a
bready
and
heavy
backbone
you
get
layers
more
along
the
belgian
line
with
heavy
banana
and
a
blend
of
clove
and
nutmeg
spicing
this
is
a
big
beer
despite
the
lower
abv
and
abundance
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
richly
sweet
and
heavy
fruit
and
bread
notes
leading
into
a
smooth
crisp
clean
finish
this
is
a
tasty
beer
give
the
carbonation
time
to
settle
out
and
you
will
see
the
drinkability
increase
greatly
as
well
as
the
layers
of
flavor
develop
for
you
reminiscent
of
the
lager
you
might
have
had
with
your
dad
back
in
the
day
but
10
times
better
tastier
and
more
complex
a
great
example
of
how
good
a
lager
beer
can
be
it
kinda
reconciled
me
with
the
style
i
wish
i
would
see
more
local
craft
brewers
do
good
lagers
like
this
this
is
a
perfect
intro
beer
for
people
new
to
craft
beer
and
will
please
beer
connoisseur
aswell
i
will
buy
again

recommanded

les

maibock
is
a
beer
that
leaves
out
all
details
save
for
the
most
practical
while
it
offers
only
the
bare
essentials
these
are
not
only
among
the
finest
quality
but
also
apportioned
very
generously
its
a
good
thing
this
brewer
has
a
penchant
for
german
styles
because
his
beers
epitomize
those
traditions
masterfully
o
this
is
a
great
maibock
with
great
flavours
o
a
fantastic
brew
light
and
refreshing
yet
surprisingly
bold
for
the
style
flavours
are
pronounced
and
are
certainly
a
great
way
to
ring
in
the
spring
well
worth
a
try
and
i
will
snatch
up
a
few
extra
bottles
before
they
disappear
very
nice
brew
for
this
time
of
year
like
a
pale
spring
morning
still
clinging
to
winters

an
unobtrusive
beer
that
seems
off

nothing
special
at
all
i
was
wondering
if
the
bottle
was
old
but
it
was
undated
alas
m
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
chew
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
d
drinkable
and
would
probably
buy
this
again
but
not
before
trying
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
which
come
more
highly
recommended
overall
this
offerings
a
bit
too
focused
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
nonetheless
worth
a
try
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
let
down
by
this
beer
as
all
the
other
offerings
from
these
guys
were
complex
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
was
too
boozy
and
one
dimensional
plus
the
nose
and
taste
was
a
little
bit
cardboardy
which
is
not
good
considering
the
abv
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thick
side
and
made
finishing
a
bottle
tough
pours
a
nice
light
blond
colour
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
has
a
sweet
hop
to
it
with
a
nice
malt
presence
very
balanced
nose
the
taste
is
very
clean
slightly
hoppy
boozy
with
a
long
sweet
finish
nice
medium
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
drinkable
but
would
have
to
split
a
750ml
couldnt
do
it
on
my
own
d
good
but
not
great
not
the
greatest
offering
from
these
guys
i
couldnt
handle
too
much
of
this
stuff
so
splitting
the
bottle
was
a
good
idea
a
good
beer
to
bridge
the
summerwinter
divide
a
bit
strong
to
be
thoroughly
quenchable
but
more
refreshing
than
your
average
big
beer
drink
not
one
my
favourite
beers
from
this
brewer
but
still
worth
a
try
nonetheless
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
d
very
impressed
a
nice
mix
of
light
hop
and
graincorn
flavours
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
a
distraction
a
very
drinkable
8
the
body
carries
a
moderate
weight
with
with
an
equal
perhaps
even
light
degree
of
carbonation
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
whilst
notable
is
soft
given
the
abv
a
very
tasty
beer
plenty
going
on
and
it
isnt
over
the
top
another
highly
drinkable
offering
from
one
of
canadas
best
breweries
i
dont
hesitate
to
buy
from
these
guys
anymore
ive
had
about
a
dozen
of
their
brews
and
only
one
has
disappointed
they
remind
me
a
little
of
great
lakes
with
their
take
on
the
german
styles
it
would
be
interesting
to
do
some
sidebysides
d
a
good
drinker
750ml
corked
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
that
doesnt
last
long
has
a
pilsnerlike
hop
aroma
with
some
alcohol
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
overly
sweet
with
some
honey
and
earthiness
and
very
alcoholic
some
light
bitterness
and
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
and
was
barely
able
to
finish
one
glass
the
harsh
alcohol
in
this
ruins
it
i
usually
like
les
trois
mousquetaires
but
this
is
their
weakest
offering
ive
tried
so
far
too
bad
this
is
a
promising
heller
bock
just
a
tad
thin
and
not
enough
body
and
bulk
to
cover
the
omnipresent
boozy
taste
almost
comes
off
like
those
cheap
adjunct
euro
malt
liquors
a
tad
rough
and
unfinished
perhaps
less
sugar
some
more
malts
and
toasted
wheat
will
take
care
of
this
in
a
future
brewing
rogue
dead
guy
is
the
only
other
maibock
ive
had
if
this
is
also
a
maibock
then
im
not
even
sure
what
a
maibock
is
i
thought
i
knew
but
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
dead
guy
im
having
trouble
finishing
this
glass
never
mind
the
750ml
bottle
about
half
the
bottle
was
eventually
poured
down
the
drain
how
can
this
same
brewery
be
responsible
for
the
porter
baltique
worst
trois
mousquetaires
serie
signature
ive
had
not
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
present
especially
as
it
warms
but
otherwise
fairly
well
balanced
a
nice
bock
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
some
warmth
going
down
but
pretty
clean
maybe
not
very
standard
but
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
the
first
time
i
was
very
impressed
the
first
time
i
had
this
after
the
baltic
porter
so
my
perception
of
the
booziness
was
likely
dulled
on
its
own
i
find
this
one
to
suffer
a
little
from
trying
to
be
too
big
for
the
style
d
theres
no
way
i
could
have
another
i
find
it
to
be
just
a
bit
to
sweet
and
to
boozy
it
just
seems
out
of
balance
this
was
quite
the
eyeopener
after
the
dead
guy
ale
the
commonality
in
category
a
bit
hard
to
see
the
alcohol
pretty
much
overwhelms
the
decent
cereal
and
herbal
hoppiness
of
this
offering
d
not
that
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
and
its
big
nature
doesnt
help
too
you
can
only
get
this
in
the
gift
pack
in
alberta
and
to
be
honest
i
dont
really
like
maibock
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
interesting
lager
not
a
light
beer
but
quite
welcome
on
a
friday
night
overall
a
rather
tasty
maibock
overall
thick
and
bready
with
a
good
showing
of
fruit
and
just
enough
hop
to
keep
it
more
balanced
and
rather
enjoyable
quite
tasty
solid
maibock
recommended
o
a
very
enjoyable
lager
and
one
that
id
be
glad
to
have
again
recommended
it
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
flirting
with
being
more
heavy
than
it
should
be
it
displays
a
modest
to
lower
level
of
carbonation
and
has
quite
a
sticky
sweet
feel
to
it
that
while
understandable
for
the
style
is
a
bit
too
exaggerated
overall
it
wasnt
a
terrible
offering
but
i
would
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
try
this
again
either
strawberry
blond
pour
with
a
nice
head
and
great
retention
hop
aromas
and
almost
an
oktoberfest
malt
scent
on
the
nose
clear
looking
clear
taste
which
is
really
smooth
a
little
too
hoppy
for
a
maibock
has
more
of
an
apa
feel
on
the
back
its
not
a
bad
brew
just
would
like
the
hops
to
be
calmed
a
bit
and
the
color
a
bit
darker
i
had
this
brew
before
in
a
couple
bombers
and
it
had
a
harsh
bitterness
but
the
sampler
case
taste
much
better
this
time
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
an
8
taste
pretty
nicely
bodied
with
some
nice
flavor
not
too
bitter
i
dont
like
bitter
beers
overall
i
was
surprised
i
thought
it
was
an
ipa
when
i
ordered
it
i
dont
like
ipas
but
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
penn
beers
overall
pretty
sweet
yea
sneaky
strong
for
a
summer
beer
this
one
could
end
up
getting
you
in
trouble
the
sweet
fruits
add
some
serious
drinkibilty
its
a
fun
beer
and
tasty
but
not
for
the
week
of
heart
i
would
prefer
a
wit
or
summer
wheat
beer
with
46
alcohol
on
a
summer
day
this
would
be
a
good
closer
or
after
the
sun
went
down
o
definitely
drinkable
and
did
have
a
few
will
certainly
have
to
get
more
before
they
disappear
maybe
a
growler
or
two
think
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
o
not
sure
if
the
bottle
was
bad
will
certainly
give
it
another
shot
and
will
rereview
as
necessary
overall
i
got
to
recommend
this
to
someone
who
likes
pilsners
and
it
was
ok
for
him
just
glad
i
got
to
try
this
for
3
00
than
8
bucks
a
22oz
drinkability
the
sticker
on
the
tap
handle
remarks
you
have
been
warned
and
the
simple
fact
is
this
is
a
light
flavored
easy
drinking
beer
with
alot
of
abv
behind
it
i
found
this
well
rounded
specimen
to
be
deserving
of
some
praise
and
plus
its
fun
to
drink
overall
i
would
say
that
penndemonium
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
if
given
the
chance
i
would
suggest
reaching
for
something
else
in
the
stellar
lineup
that
the
penn
brewery
produces
d
drinkable
but
alcohol
could
really
catch
up
with
you
for
the
price
its
a
steal
for
an
interesting
and
creative
beer
i
paid
us1
90
for
a
22oz
bomber
locally
not
bad
there
seems
to
be
a
soft
diacetyl
influence
at
times
that
can
make
this
a
bit
on
the
buttery
side
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
even
though
i
can
be
particularly
sensitive
to
it
at
times
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
cloudy
apricot
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
the
foam
settle
to
a
thin
layer
within
minutes
and
remains
for
most
of
the
glass
nose
and
flavor
are
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
apples
pears
nectarines
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
slightly
spicy
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
musty
doughy
malt
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
the
taste
has
a
honeydoughy
malt
sweetness
some
light
lemon
a
bit
grainy
and
a
pepperybitter
hop
balance
nice
helles
flavors
though
a
bit
hot
from
the
booze
moderate
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
fairly
balanced
the
high
abv
kills
the
drinkability
but
the
brew
has
nice
flavors
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thick
head
lacing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
quite
faint
but
wisps
of
orange
and
malt
backbone
are
what
i
can
pick
up
taste
is
malty
with
some
tartness
towards
the
back
almost
like
a
sour
grain
taste
quite
a
complex
taste
that
has
many
different
cascading
flavors
some
notes
of
banana
some
of
the
alcohol
is
present
at
the
back
of
the
throat
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
is
10
there
is
enough
carbonation
to
cut
the
alcohol
and
enough
body
to
it

i
like
this
thanks
jay
opinion
i
dont
know
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
bock
beers
and
this
is
about
90
of
what
i
brew
dunkels
to
doppelbocks
this
beer
really
tastes
macro
to
me
and
could
pass
for
a
better
quality
malt
liquor
if
you
put
this
in
a
brown
paper
bag
you
would
make
a
fine
wino
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
from
this
beer
and
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
at
all
if
they
were
using
adjuncts
even
though
they
say
that
this
is
a
bock
beer
on
the
label
i
would
pass
on
this
on
in
the
future
and
would
barely
drink
it
over
iced
tea
or
some
such
overall
it
was
average
way
too
much
alcohol
in
it
to
be
considered
really
good
for
the
style
i
just
think
this
was
one
extreme
beer
that
could
have
been
well
served
toned
down
a
few
notchs
md
thin
but
sticky
mouthfeel
is
sadly
thin
but
bubbles
save
it
from
being
awful
overall
im
not
sure
its
highly
drinkable
but
its
different
and
the
alcohol
content
is
super
sneaky
for
5ish
bucks
id
get
it
again
hooray
for
this
find
i
am
pleased
pours
a
clear
bronze
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
not
much
lacing
left
behind
but
continuous
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
booze
honey
toasted
grains
and
candy
sugar
nothing
more
nothing
less
peppery
grains
up
front
on
the
tongue
followed
by
light
fruits
grapes
pears
apples
and
caramel
malt
lots
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
too
much
in
fact
the
flavor
could
use
some
hops
for
balance
aftertaste
is
slightly
warm
from
the
alcohol
and
malty
with
a
lingering
honey
flavor
to
it
body
is
light
with
a
strong
carbonation
and
slick
feel
too
much
candy
flavors
and
the
high
abv
make
this
one
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
maibocks
should
stick
around
in
the
6
abv
range
i
understand
everyone
is
jumping
onto
the
extreme
beer
bandwagon
but
come
on
this
is
a
bit
over
the
top
d
not
really
my
style
but
not
bad
d
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
high
that
coupled
with
the
dinner
bottle
makes
this
a
one
and
done
the
brewers
reserve
series
is
proving
to
be
a
nice
lineup
i
really
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
here
it
was
surprisingly
bland
and
also
way
too
hot
i
wouldnt
revisit
drinkability
now
i
know
why
they
say
on
the
label
that
this
beer
created
an
uproar
at
the
brewery
and
why
they
put
youve
been
warned
on
the
label
thats
because
its
not
good
like
i
said
before
it
was
same
boring
flavors
over
and
over
again
dont
be
fooled
by
the
cool
shiny
label
because
directly
behind
the
label
is
a
below
avaerage
beer
theres
no
way
i
would
waste
any
more
money
on
this
beer
again
youve
be
warned
pretty
tasty
and
easily
pegged
as
a
big
maibock
what
happened
to
the
carbonation
and
head
perhaps
its
way
past
prime
no
dating
on
the
bottle
so
no
way
too
tell
pretty
much
an
extreme
maibock
double
maibock
imperial
maibock
well
maybe
not
as
the
hops
are
kept
in
check
but
it
is
higher
on
the
abv
side
and
its
a
little
thick
dextrins
its
enjoyable
and
certainly
worth
a
try
recommended
if
i
lived
within
the
distribution
area
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
a
lot
this
spring
drinkability
this
beer
would
do
for
any
occasion
calling
for
bock
d
average
brew
overall
per
style
wouldnt
have
seconds
d
definitely
not
session
beer
some
beers
hide
their
alcohol
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
not
my
favorite
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
this
is
an
aboveaverage
beer
it
hides
its
extreme
qualities
very
well
and
as
such
is
quite
approachable
for
the
nonextreme
beer
drinker
poured
from
a
bomber
and
served
next
to
a
festive
jambalaya
burrito
aside
from
complimenting
the
spicy
burrito
im
struck
by
two
things
with
this
beer
first
the
flavor
is
too
subtle
for
an
8
beer
second
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
feel
more
like
im
drinking
some
weird
german
bock
hybrid
of
the
english
bitter
all
the
flavors
the
grassy
hops
bready
malt
and
sharp
bock
fruit
ester
are
all
a
touch
muted
at
the
same
time
this
beer
feels
exceedingly
creamy
in
a
great
way
and
my
bottle
is
empty
in
no
time
while
its
a
shame
this
beer
isnt
richer
it
will
also
sneak
up
on
you
this
one
poured
a
slightly
hazed
golden
amber
and
was
topped
by
an
offwhite
head
composed
of
average
sized
bubbles
the
head
retention
was
pretty
good
and
there
was
some
coarse
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
was
really
malty
with
some
grain
and
crackery
character
plus
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
flavour
was
quite
sweet
and
malty
and
the
bitterness
was
restrained
there
were
also
fruity
notes
and
a
tangy
slight
tartness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
it
had
just
a
bit
of
warmth
and
good
texture
easy
drinking
for
a
fairly
big
beer
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
behind
the
big
malt
character
i
bought
this
bottle
out
of
curiosity
from
minottis
liquor
in
north
olmsted
oh
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
nose
is
like
dried
wheat
if
not
wheat
then
just
dried
straw
i
just
think
dried
when
i
take
a
whiff
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
sweet
touch
to
it
the
sweet
might
be
overstated
for
some
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
and
the
liquid
is
good
as
well
seems
a
bit
too
sticky
though
overall
this
is
good
but
a
bit
too
lopsided
with
the
sweet
edge
to
it
very
clear
pale
beer
with
almost
no
head
what
little
head
there
is
fades
extremely
fast
aroma
is
alcoholic
and
malty
with
almost
no
hops
very
clean
aroma
no
esters
flavor
is
alcoholic
and
malty
with
a
faint
hop
presence
warms
all
the
way
down
again
a
very
clean
flavor
no
yeasty
earthy
or
ester
characters
finishes
very
well
balanced
strong
for
style
but
real
nice
d
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
this
is
a
fine
example
this
lager
is
so
drinkable
it
is
big
and
full
w
a
smooth
subtle
sweetness
a
class
act
from
penn
brewing
extremely
well
made
mai
bock
superbly
quaffable
i
enjoyed
every
taste
from
1st
to
last
cant
wait
to
share
this
again
if
the
chance
arises
beer
is
good
happy
big
pa
bock
beering
overall
a
nice
beer
that
tastes
great
penn
makes
the
greatest
hefe
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
and
the
skill
and
care
used
in
that
beer
is
transformed
into
this
one
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
was
a
true
joy
to
try
it
there
were
plenty
of
its
brothers
and
sisters
left
on
the
shelf
and
lets
just
say
i
will
adopt
a
few
more
from
the
family
for
those
not
so
cold
winter
months
ahead
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
perfect
it
has
a
wonderful
pale
and
munich
malt
scent
along
with
a
slight
bisquity
aroma
its
rich
with
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
as
well
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
fruity
pale
malt
and
yeast
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
sweet
and
malty
with
loads
of
munich
malts
it
light
and
highly
drinkable
even
at
10
it
has
a
mild
bisquit
character
that
really
rounds
out
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
really
dont
see
much
wrong
except
i
would
maybe
increase
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
to
make
it
a
bit
heavier
but
really
its
fine
the
way
it
is
this
is
my
first
penn
beer
and
its
damn
good
i
could
drink
more
of
these
for
sure
d
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
and
then
takes
the
style
to
the
next
level
which
isnt
done
very
often
with
mai
bocks
much
less
this
well
a
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
and
enjoying
them
quite
a
bit
at
that
point
however
either
the
abv
may
catchup
with
me
or
i
might
be
too
full
to
drink
much
more
either
way
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
great
deal
i
would
say
that
this
doesnt
compeletly
stay
to
the
bock
beer
style
it
does
ressemble
a
mai
bock
either
way
this
is
good
brew
bomber
bottle
clear
medium

initially
lifts
a

sweet

lovers
rejoice
this
one
is

the
mouthfeel
is

medium
where
is
the
10
abv
seriously
this
is
probably
the
most
dangerous
beer
i
have
had
drinks
like
a
spaten
which
i
could
easily
finish
a
6
pack
of
but
is
leaving
me
cross
eyed
with
this
bomber
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
its
yours
you
better
give
this
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
syrupy
with
a
very
lowsmooth
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
especially
with
the
big
alcohol
content
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
ever

pours
up
your
standard
clear
golden
pils
color
with
a
disappointingly
shortlived
bone
white
head
that
immediately
seperated
into
a
thin
soapy
collar
very
few
streamers
of
fine
carbonation
color
aside
not
a
pleasant
looking
brew
aromas
of
pale
malts
honeydew
light
must
and
some
malt
liquorlike
vegetal
fusel
alcohols
im
feeling
that
the
subtle
carbonation
is
not
pulling
all
the
aroma
through
but
what
aromas
im
getting
are
certainly
more
pleasant
than
its
appearance
the
flavor
is
mildly
fruity
with
some
faint
tropical
notes
lightly
kilned
pale
malt
sweetness
shines
throughout
sugarcoated
green
apple
alcohol
warmth
follows
each
sip
carbonation
is
way
too
low
for
the
thickness
if
the
beer
and
is
a
serious
detrement
to
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
im
not
entirely
sure
that
this
bottle
wasnt
shipped
andor
stored
properly
even
though
it
was
bought
from
a
very
reputable
source
i
imagine
a
better
bottle
would
be
like
trompe
la
morte
stepped
up
a
notch
overall
experience
wasnt
horrible
it
could
have
been
piss
flat
but
pretty
close
to
it
maybe
ill
find
a
better
bottle
and
give
it
another
whirl
kind
of
disappointing
because
i
really
enjoy
all
of
penns
worldclass
line
of
beers
this
one
just
either
missed
its
mark
completely
not
meant
to
age
several
months
or
was
tainted
somewhere
between
brewery
and
vendor
interesting
style
pleasant
drink
gotta
be
honest
i
preferred
this
one
on
tap
the
bottle
with
a
few
months
of
aging
doesnt
go
down
as
smooth
as
those
pints
at
fatheads
smokin
joes
and
bocktown
did
in
the
past
basically
if
you
have
this
on
hand
or
plan
to
try
it
do
so
as
soon
as
possible
its
not
turning
but
its
not
getting
any
better
penndmonium
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
without
noticeable
hops
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
at
times
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
thin
this
went
down
pretty
easy
i
enjoyed
it
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
isnt
fantastic
this
is
a
sipper
beer
and
on
a
hot
florida
day
likt
this
i
wouldnt
choose
this
again
in
the
heat
of
the
day
great
for
a
cool
night
though
dangerous
beer
would
never
guess
this
is
a
10
beer
right
up
there
with
st
nicholas
bock
great
beer
drinkability
i
could
say
its
neither
the
most
exciting
beer
i
have
ever
faced
nor
is
it
really
a
beer
id
return
to
but
why
interfere
with
the
pbc
live
and
let
live
i
say
very
enjoyable
d
this
beer
is
ok
the
big
sweetness
in
the
flavor
makes
this
one
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
for
me
but
for
maibock
fans
this
may
be
a
decent
choice
pours
a
pale
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
nothing
spectacular
about
the
appearance
at
all
and
i
was
a
bit
bummed
that
the
head
faded
relatively
fast
and
left
behind
no
lace
oh
well
so
it
goes
the
aroma
is
a
nice
banana
nut
and
clove
scent
with
some
pepper
and
a
faint
strawberrypear
smell
off
in
the
distance
a
slightly
boozy
floral
aroma
but
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
enough
on
the
whole
by
the
banana
clove
scent
not
bad
this
beer
tastes
okay
a
decent
enough
blend
of
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
spicey
again
that
peppery
banana
nut
bread
flavor
is
prominent
and
the
cloves
settle
in
again
as
well
light
fruit
flavors
although
nothing
really
rises
up
to
clarify
crisp
dry
finish
from
a
smooth
mouthfeel
im
not
sure
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
call
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
an
interesting
potent
10
abv
maibock
and
it
would
pair
nicely
i
think
with
a
fruit
salad
or
some
fruitrelated
dessert
like
a
pound
cake
with
fresh
strawberries
on
top
definitely
worth
a
try
i
love
the
idea
behind
this
brew
and
the
brewers
at
penn
did
a
nice
job
prosit
mk
just
a
hint
of
smoke
in
here
too
but
not
so
much
smoked
malts
but
more
of
a
cigarette
smoke
not
pleasing
this
beer
was
very
disappointing
to
me
i
love
penn
beers
this
just
seems
like
a
malt
liquor
then
i
read
here
that
it
is
10
alcohol
should
a
true
maibock
be
10
i
think
not
lacks
depth
and
character
d
very
easydrinking
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
made
this
beer
stand
out
in
my
mind
definitely
worth
a
try
d
not
bad
unless
i
find
it
on
tap
i
doubt
i
will
have
it
again
worth
a
try
if
you
like
malty
bocks
overall
i
was
anticipating
trying
this
brew
for
weeks
and
i
am
glad
i
did
great
authentic
flavors
not
sure
if
it
fits
exactly
into
the
traditional
maibock
style
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
hybrid
a
quality
brew
nonetheless
another
fabulous
offering
from
penn
brewery
cheers
drinkability
mostly
clean
and
smooth
some
bitterness
in
the
end
note
my
ratings
on
this
brew
are
pretty
high
and
might
be
higher
than
some
other
brews
i
like
better
than
this
one
like
i
said
before
im
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
helles
bocks
but
this
penn
brew
is
especially
good
when
comparing
it
to
others
in
the
style
so
im
going
to
rate
it
fairly
high
drinkability
an
exceptional
maibock
even
though
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
hides
the
alcohol
well
perhaps
the
only
drawback
is
it
has
very
little
aroma
which
is
a
shame
because
the
taste
is
excellent
will
be
heading
down
the
hill
to
score
some
22
oz
bottles
of
this
were
it
not
for
the
abv
which
is
very
well
disguised
this
would
be
the
perfect
summer
beer
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
but
does
not
taste
the
least
bit
heavy
or
tiring
to
drink
the
beer
list
at
maxs
indicates
the
abv
is
8
but
whether
its
8
or
10
this
is
definitely
a
sizable
beer
excellent
effort
from
penn
brewing
d
a
big
bold
german
style
lager
from
a
brewery
that
does
them
up
right
i
for
one
welcome
our
new
high
gravity
penn
beers
the
flavor
is
what
makes
this
beer
shine
oh
yeah
this
beer
can
seriously
hamstring
you
as
well
alcohol
is
invisible
and
it
really
is
10abv
if
you
see
it
listed
as
8
thats
from
the
abw
listed
on
penns
website
this
is
a
great
new
release
by
penn
brewery
it
pours
a
pale
transparent
straw
yellow
with
a
healthy
white
head
it
has
a
pretty
light
smell
the
taste
is
light
and
wonderful
smooth
malt
at
the
beginning
with
some
light
fruit
and
spice
flavoring
light
sweet
malt
maybe
honey
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
smooth
i
had
no
idea
the
abv
was
this
high
until
i
checked
it
out
after
i
got
home
a
delcious
new
addition
to
the
penn
lineup
i
reccomend
trying
it
this
is
delicious
you
should
get
it
this
is
my
goto
beer
every
time
found
it
at
a
local
bar
that
has
a
beerofthemonth
2
years
ago
i
think
they
kept
it
on
as
a
regular
beer
because
i
kept
them
sold
out
great
flavor
very
good
drinker
this
beer
didnt
really
wow
me
for
the
price
i
paid
for
it
bought
soley
for
trying
a
different
brew
not
great
not
horrible
on
to
my
next
new
brew
great
color
but
im
having
a
tough
time
placing
the
flavor
the
bottle
says
hearty
and
balanced
and
ill
give
it
that
also
i
have
to
ask
why
theyre
calling
it
an
ale
if
its
a
maibock
arent
those
lager
yeasts
classic
malt
flavors
with
a
light
crisp
lager
personality
the
malt
is
slightly
caramel
sweet
with
some
grainy
barley
light
nut
and
even
a
bit
of
coffee
bean
an
aggressive
pour
shows
two
fingers
offwhite
soapy
head
with
fair
retention
and
good
lacing
amber
brown
with
some
red
and
very
light
cloudiness
smell
is
not
very
powerful
brown
sugar
and
bready
taste
matches
aroma
adequately
with
addition
of
pineapple
and
some
spices
higher
carbonation
lingers
on
front
and
middle
of
tongue
for
half
a
minute
or
so
decent
body
not
as
heavy
as
i
had
imagined
a
little
on
watery
side
overall
a
good
brew
not
very
complex
but
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
wont
be
buying
regularly
due
to
price
but
will
buy
again
just
the
same
the
name
says
it
all
imagine
squeezing
the
fluid
from
the
rotting
corpse
of
a
homeless
crackhead
whose
last
shower
was
recorded
in
the
dead
sea
scrolls
not
something
i
would
drink
again
o
2
50
this
is
very
disappointing
the
bottle
includes
no
useful
information
so
this
might
be
a
really
old
bottle
but
that
is
rogues
fault
not
mine
suffer
with
a
bad
rating
the
mouthfeel
was
way
off
it
is
just
like
water
no
carbonation
feeling
at
all
even
with
the
2
finger
head
then
the
taste
was
poor
too
i
wont
drink
this
again
banana
bread
brown
sugar
this
is
good
ale
exceptional
taste
in
one
word
outstanding
overall
pretty
solid
across
the
board
well
rounded
and
definitely
would
come
back
to
this
but
for
the
affordability
and
accessibility
in
canada
smell
and
stay
totally
out
off
the
stile
so
much
sugar
one
of
my
favorite
beers
my
favorite
beer
by
a
wide
margin
worth
the
price
o
yeastheavy
beer
with
a
classic
flavor
and
a
fair
bit
of
bitterness
strong
metallic
taste
great
for
some
i
suppose
just
not
for
me
the
malt
is
pretty
well
foregrounded
with
spicy
hops
and
bitterness
providing
punctuation
very
flavorful
though
a
bit
buttery
the
alcohol
is
slight
but
works
well
with
the
spiciness
overall
pretty
dang
good
and
a
nice
match
up
with
a
tasty
salad
dressed
with
white
wine
vinegar
dressing
this
one
is
a
real
summer
brew
and
has
nice
developing
flavour
that
makes
it
interesting
to
drink
this
beer
is
fairly
standard
for
rogue
im
not
particularly
crazy
about
it
it
comes
off
somewhat
bland
and
lacking
in
any
distinguishable
characteristics
awesome
beer
really
light
and
refreshing
for
how
heavy
it
is

at

light
bodied
decent
beer
but
not
very

it
is
just
to
hoppy
for
my
taste
malty
and
sweet
in
saying
that
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
and
a
dry
balanced
finish
however
its
gently
hopped
to
cut
the
sweetness
a
great
overall
beer
all
around
fantastic
beer
overall
always
a
good
choice
when
there
are
no
other
good
choices
if
that
makes
sense
overall
this
is
an
good
and
complex
lager
a
mix
of
very
malty
and
slightly
bitter
definetly
worth
a
try
if
you
want
to
know
what
malty
means
its
just
ok
not
great
this
was
hoppier
than
i
expected
a
very
solid
beer
although
it
tends
to
have
a
slightly
saltly
finish
on
my
pallet
its
not
pricey
and
worth
the
buy
if
you
havent
had
it
before
very
dinkable
albeit
malty
creamy
with
nice
head
not
crazy
about
this
whatsoever
good
malty
rounded
beer
thats
a
very
good
average
if
that
makes
any
sense
poured
into
a
flute
glass
burnt
orange
color
held
just
a
bit
of
a
film
of
head
well
below
a
finger
the
aroma
was
light
and
personally
one
of
the
most
lacking
parts
of
the
beer
for
me
it
had
a
nice
smooth
malty
taste
upfront
with
a
strong
hoppy
aftertaste
with
bits
of
piney
notes
in
between
it
was
a
nice
decently
rounded
beer
that
would
be
a
great
refresher
not
too
much
going
on
but
a
solid
beer
aroma
was
the
most
lacking
part
of
my
personal
experience
with
the
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
2
inch
head
slowly
dissipates
smells
like
straight
malt
taste
is
average
thick
and
malty
slightly
refreshing
just
not
my
style
maybe
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
bad
im
a
fan
of
bock
brews
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
but
id
drink
if
u
bought
me
one
good
beer
not
a
huge
fan
very
nice
beer
with
an
inviting
hoppy
aroma
burnt
orange
colour
leading
to
a
taste
profile
that
is
well
balanced
including
some
saaz
spiciness
as
well
as
a
firm
bready
malt
base
some
pine
and
resiny
earthy
notes
all
well
put
together
to
make
a
hoppy
session
ale
that
is
very
refreshing
body
is
well
balanced
and
bright
hope
are
forward
but
the
whole
is
a
quite
complete
package
and
certainly
very
interesting
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
white
head
the
head
leaves
big
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
is
fruity
caramel
and
bready
and
the
taste
is
even
moreso
those
with
a
nice
earthy
hops
finish
the
body
is
lighter
but
not
watery
with
a
little
carbonation
and
nice
finish
tasted
like
chemicals
and
syrupy
like
old
cough
syrup
overall
im
underwhelmed
its
a
good
solid
sessionable
brew
but
not
one
that
id
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
for
willing
to
give
it
another
chance
maybe
a
bottle
instead
like
a
comfortable
pair
of
old
shoes
that
you
find
in
the
back
of
your
closet
and
put
on
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
i
found
the
taproom
in
the
dalles
was
out
of
my
favorite
ipa
when
i
went
to
fill
a
growler
but
seeing
they
had
dead
guy
on
tap
and
i
hadnt
had
it
in
years
i
said
fill
er
up
that
night
after
a
day
of
steelhead
fishing
i
opened
my
growler
and
was
almost
blown
away
at
how
good
that
dead
guy
was
from
draft
its
so
damn
drinkable
refreshing
and
goes
perfectly
with
almost
any
food
youd
want
to
pair
it
with
love
it
just
a
great
beer
a
balanced
amber
with
present
hop
and
malt
flavour
the
kind
of
brew
that
you
could
enjoy
all
night
look
is
very
good
everything
else
is
ok
finally
rewarded
myself
wthis
while
not
earth
shattering
it
was
definitely
worth
it
great
look
swirled
red
in
the
middle
surrounded
by
cloudy
gold
holding
tons
of
flavor
bursts
id
recommend
it
anytime
a
true
legend
in
the
microbrew
universe
overall
this
is
great
a
real
pleasure
when
youre
in
the
right
mood
ive
been
drinking
this
one
for
years
since
my
little
bro
used
to
live
a
few
miles
away
from
the
brewery
it
is
quite
different
than
both
the
very
different
german
and
american
maibocks
i
know
best
but
i
think
it
it
is
still
a
delicious
brew
overall
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
ever
had
lots
of
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
not
too
bitter
nicely
balanced
drinkable
but
not
notable
in
any
way
mehhh
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
thanks
dan
davis
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
rogue
ales
nicely
complex
without
too
much
of
the
cloying
nut
character
that
tends
to
overpower
a
lot
of
their
beers
not
too
pricy
at
au14
for
a
650ml
bottle
perhaps
once
every
now
and
then
good
a
little
sweet
2nd
best
so
far
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
i
would
gladly
order
again
this
is
definitely
an
americanized
maibock
so
dont
go
into
this
one
expecting
the
subtleties
of
a
traditional
german
one
nonetheless
the
beer
is
exceedingly
drinkable
and
highly
flavorful
and
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
just
fantastic
the
bottle
design
the
logo
and
not
to
mention
the
beer
for
whatever
reason
i
only
drink
these
in
the
winter
time
and
i
always
look
forward
to
drinking
this
more
than
christmas
itself
i
love
the
rogue
brand
and
dead
guy
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
dead
guy
even
though
i
have
been
into
beers
for
a
while
i
tend
to
pass

foreign
brews
i
was
delighted
to
find
a
modern
west
coast
brew
that
was
not
dominated
by
hops
but
then
this
is
from

not

this
is
a

i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
this
beer
perhaps
im
not
a
fan
of
the
maibock
style
but
this
one
was
just
too
intense
and
never
really
focused
on
any
single
flavor
there
was
no
vantage
point
for
me
it
was
all
jumbled

in

nice

all
i
have
to
say
is
if
you
have
not
fulfilled
your
satisfaction
yet
buy
a
dead
guy
ale
a
good
brew
while
the
head
is
attractive
the
lacing
meh
and
the
colorclarity
of
the
ale
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
aroma
is
very
tempting
and
the
flavor
does
not
miss
expectations
the
palate
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
reliable
ale
good
but
not
outstanding
overall
extremely
drinkable
and
not
overly
complex
a
beer
i
could
drink
everyday
and
not
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
drink
it
i
e
something
like
a
quad
perfectly
balanced
from
beginning
to
end
no
stray
flavors
no
astringent
aftertaste
a
fantastic
beer
love
this
beer
truly
delicious
overall
above
average
to
outstanding
i
have
not
tried
any
other
maibock
or
helles
bock
so
i
was
probably
a
little
conservative
noticing
the
hops
in
the
recipe
i
would
hazard
that
rogue
did
their
research
right
on
this
one
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
if
i
can
grab
it
on
tap
which
shouldnt
be
hard
overall
worth
the
try
at
least
once
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
multiple
in
one
sitting
slightly
overpriced
o
delicious
great
warm
weather
beer
nice
brew
here
the
color
i
would
describe
as
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
has
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
bread
and
malts
come
out
first
on
the
palate
and
balances
out
well
with
the
hops
it
is
very
drinkable
and
almost
gets
better
after
a
few
nice
job
great
oregon
beer
enjoyed
in
atlanta
loves
rogues

but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
nothing
special
or
different
that
this
beer
brings
to
the

nyc
far
better
on
tap
than
from
bottle
bordering
on
the
crisp
side
hops
are
well
under
control
and
there
is
a
slight
apricot
in
the
sweetness
in
a
word
a
classy
glass
oops
that
was
two
words
but
you
get
my
drift
oi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
while
having
very
little
expectation
a
nice
switch
from
my
usual
ipa
addiction
i
was
surprised
that
rogue
brewing
companys
dead
guy
ale
was
supposed
to
be
a
maibock
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
maibock
to
me
im
sure
its
great
for
people
who
enjoy
ales
but
im
just
not
one
i
prefer
the
subtle
sweetness
of
spaten
sam
adams
or
even
gordon
biersch
bocks
all
in
all
this
is
another
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
but
probably
not
buy
again
just
absed
on
the
beer
alone
add
in
the
premium
rogue
seems
to
add
to
all
their
beers
and
it
is
definitely
not
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
i
would
get
this
brew
again
o
shit
probably
only
had
this
once
or
twice
in
the
past
10
years
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
but
i
love
bitter
malty
fullish
beers
minus
all
the
tuttifruity
nonsense
if
youre
familiar
enough
with
rogues
ales
you
may
very
well
peg
this
as
one
right
away
that
pacman
is
quite
distinct
well
see
what
the
price
point
on
this
is
but
i
could
see
drinking
this
more
often
dark
straw
lines
of
lace
vertically
taste
and
smell
are
grains
and
malts
germanic
balance
with
a
really
quite
sweet
palate
nice
to
only
have
a
sampler
as
this
is
not
cutting
it
bland
beer
if
well
made

into

pint

pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
coppery

with
a
half
finger

head
with

retention
and
lots
of

aroma
of
biscuit
and
caramel

mild

is
semisweet
caramel

with

developing
and
finishing
with

with
light
pine
and

elements
great
balance
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
im
really
overdue
to
review
this
northwest
classic
which
i
started
drinking
ages
ago
as
wolfeel
ale
one
of
the
early
flavorful
beers
that
pulled
me
into
craft
styles
nothing
really
stands
out
in
this
maibock
but
it
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
with
a
nice
flavor
progression
from
the
lightly
sweet
maltiness
into
a
good
non
herbal
mild
hop
finish
really
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
with
a
domestic
slant
and
a
great
drinking
beer
very
nice
malt
flavors
glad
to
revisit
it
overall
an
outstanding
4
given
to
dead
guy
ale
from
rogue
ales
this
was
beyond
smooth
for
a
brew
over
6
abv
too
bad
i
hadnt
picked
this
up
earlier
in
my
life
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
clear
amber
pour
with
a
slight
dark
ruby
cast
massive
head
with
normal
lacing
that
retains
well
nose
of
caramel
over
sweet
floral
against
a
very
subtle
spiciness
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
that
hints
at
oily
resin
normal
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
complex
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
citric
tartness
flows
into
a
softer
caramel
light
sweetness
that
gradually
comes
to
the
forefront
with
a
bit
of
spicy
heat
it
finishes
with
a
sweet
fade
into
light
hop
bitterness
coupled
with
a
light
spicy
hop
flavor
an
outstanding
and
well
crafted
maibock
pours
almost
a
reddish
yellow
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
trails
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
citrus
but
with
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
to
it
the
first
taste
was
nice
and
crisp
with
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
and
banana
sweetness
to
it
which
then
yielded
to
a
nice
yeast
taste
the
balance
was
very
nice
which
transitioned
to
a
piney
yet
subtle
hop
finish
that
made
the
beer
incredibly
drinkable
regardless
of
weather
a
very
good
beer
worth
trying
overall
a
decent
summer
ale
one
of
the
most
outstandingly
drinkable
brews
out
there
smooth
and
refreshing
without
being
weak
or
too
summery
not
too
bitter
and
not
too
sweet
a
perfect
and
i
mean
perfect
beer
for
a
time
when
you
really
dont
feel
like
thinking
about
your
beer
simply
enjoy
if
all
other
breweries
made
beers
like
this
the
world
would
be
a
drunker
place
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
refreshing
beer
that
i
would
categorize
as
very
close
in
style
to
american
pale
ales
the
biggest
thing
i
was
surprised
by
is
the
lack
of
flavor
this
is
a
very
light
tasting
beer
with
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
but
it
drinks
like
water
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
not
a
dissatisfying
beer
it
is
just
slightly
perplexing
my
tastes
may
be
biased
however
as
i
am
a
fan
of
ipas
and
dark
heavy
beers
and
this
is
dead
center
between
the
two
overall
i
wouldnt
not
recommend
it
but
wouldnt
push
strongly
to
recommend
it
perhaps
the
word
bland
fits
as
a
description
but
i
would
buy
it
again
sometimes
bland
is
all
you
need
confused
on
one
thing
this
is
a
maibock
but
is
marketed
as
an
ale
this
is
a
cool
beer
it
had
more
carbonation
than
most
beers
ive
had
before
and
was
lighter
in
nature
it
was
really
refreshing
which
was
one
of
my
favorite
qualities
of
it
all
around
i
gave
this
one
a
solid
3
5
if
youre
sitting
at
a
bar
reading
this
wondering
if
its
a
good
call
go
for
it
definitely
worth
at
least
trying
o
easy
to
drink
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
presence
interesting
blend
of
malts
and
hops
in
this
one
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
style
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
ill
admit
like
so
many
im
sure
that
found
this
i
bought
this
brew
due
to
its
fun
bottle
and
name
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
upon
opening
this
one
up
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
it
has
a
pleasant
light
fruity
smell
to
it
very
drinkable
and
has
some
caramel
malt
flavor
to
it
and
well
balanced
slight
bitter
hop
taste
its
full
bodied
but
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
will
be
on
my
purchase
again
list
no
doubt
nice
job
to
rogue
ill
be
looking
to
try
some
more
brews
from
this
company
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
style
pretty
simple
with
just
flavors
of
toast
and
malt
but
rather
tasty
for
the
style
nice
and
crisp
as
well
i
drank
this
beer
like
it
was
intended
from
a
gigantic
cask
purchased
at
bottles
bins
in
monterey
ca
it
had
an
amazing
strong
aroma
that
enticed
me
through
out
my
journey
it
had
a
small
amount
of
sediment
that
also
made
for
a
great
taste
really
bitter
for
those
first
timers
an
interesting
one
almost
seems
like
an
american
pale
ale
definitely
an
unusual
take
on
the
maibock
style
with
the
beer
growing
on
you
as
you
work
your
way
down
the
glass
a
good
beer
but
i
imagine
this
will
be
a
one
off
for
me
and
i
wont
be
trying
to
pick
it
up
again
poured
from
a
650
ml
bottle
i
think
i
picked
this
one
up
at
firefly
on
cambie
near
12th
clear
copper
in
colour
with
about
a
centimetre
of
offwhite
head
and
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
like
toasted
maritime
brown
bread
but
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
nicely
balanced
flavours
o
different
taste
but
great
beer
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
ale
finishes
with
a
resiny
quality
that
stays
in
throat
it
could
use
a
bit
more
alelike
ester
ogreat
beer
by
rogue
remarks
great
beer
i
was
introduced
to
dead
guy
last
year
and
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
its
dark
color
is
a
great
to
see
in
a
tall
glass
and
provides
a
mature
rich
taste
compared
to
some
other
ales
ive
had
its
taste
is
very
powerful
at
first
and
then
relaxes
which
is
what
an
ale
should
do
if
theres
somewhere
where
this
is
on
tap
please
let
me
know
bottled
is
great
but
im
guessing
on
tap
would
provide
a
better
taste
and
you
would
be
able
to
taste
the
ingredients
more
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
well
crafted
with
many
fine
qualities
perhaps
not
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
that
does
it
for
me
but
i
respect
that
this
is
a
wellbuilt
brew
that
hits
all
the
bases
o
very
good
showing
from
rouge
simple
yet
extraordinary
o
an
outstanding
offering
from
an
excellent
brewery
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
beers
overall
pretty
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
and
nice
flavor
profile
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
and
trying
to
figure
why
i
havent
might
be
having
more
of
these
in
the
close
future
very
easy
to
enjoy
drink
the
whole
bottle
this
is
a
nice
brew
overall
an
extremely
good
beer
simply
because
of
the
greate
aroma
combined
with
the
good
mouthfeel
for
some
reason
the
64
oz
growler
seems
to
have
a
slightly
stronger
signature
than
the
12
oz
bottle
and
the
double
dead
guy
is
really
a
treat
o
i
was
expecting
far
more
from
such
a
highly
rated
beer
and
was
terribly
disappointed
o
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
it
definitely
has
a
ton
of
flavor
to
me
the
bitterness
that
i
got
from
the
beer
was
more
of
a
plain
ole
bitterness
as
opposed
to
a
hoppy
one
maybe
it
was
just
my
bottle
but
either
way
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
would
suggest
that
you
taste
it
cold
and
notice
the
hop
bite
that
it
has
and
then
let
it
warm
up
and
get
the
caramel
and
molasses
notes
that
come
through
this
is
an
interesting
change
of
pace
beer
from
the
typical
ipas
porters
and
saisons
that
ive
been
drinking
lately
good
gateway
beer
into
craft
imo
my
exs
favorite
beer
so
ive
drunken
a
lot
of
this
stuff
nice
hazy
amber
color
which
is
my
favorite
part
its
very
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
hoppy
not
that
id
mind
if
it
was
i
cant
say
much
about
the
smell
other
than
its
also
very
balanced
its
nicely
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
that
lingers
for
awhile
in
your
mouth
the
taste
packs
a
punch
but
its
also
very
drinkable
o
i
generally
hate
lagers
let
me
reiterate
i
hate
lagers
mainly
because
they
leave
me
feeling
incomplete
and
i
just
go
for
ales
but
this
is
damn
good
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
while
eating
something
light
like
a
light
fish
or
salad
this
is
very
drinkable
light
with
the
perfect
balance
of
everything
that
should
make
a
lager
great
i
will
be
having
this
again
and
again
and
again
this
beer
is
near
perfect
in
that
its
deep
and
complex
without
bludgeoning
your
senses
there
is
a
xmas
cookielike
flavor
here
biscuity
and
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
to
add
to
the
overall
dimension
of
things
the
hop
bitterness
blends
well
with
the
malts
and
completes
the
package
adding
nice
overall
depth
and
complexity
to
this
palate
pleaser
honestly
really
like
it
but
dont
understand
the
pricetag
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
draught
though
and
will
probably
throw
down
for
a
sixer
at
some
point
mouthfeel
was
satisfying
very
smooth
balanced
and
goes
down
easy
definitely
a
drinking
beer
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
quick
succession
and
still
be
thirsty
for
more
o
great
drinkability
very
easydrinking
like
a
good
bock
beer
should
be
an
american
classic
in
a
german
body
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
bitter
beers
i
know
of
with
soft
hoppy
initial
taste
and
a
not
too
strong
aftertaste
that
lingers
well
still
trying
to
find
food
that
it
goes
well
with
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
a
winner
o
a
very
good
beer
would
buy
again
if
it
was
accessible
very
good
intro
beer
as
well
o
definitely
recommend
enjoyable
beer
that
is
balanced
rather
well
this
is
a
great
beer
that
must
be
tried
for
people
that
like
maibocks
and
dont
want
to
spend
a
whole
lot
on
it
its
usually
1011
a
6
pack
reccommended
dark
ruby
mostly
opaque
beer
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
bready
sweet
like
bananas
all
about
the
malts
maybe
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
somewhere
in
there
thick
bready
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
honey
up
front
then
caramel
and
other
malt
sweetness
followed
by
an
awesome
bitter
finish
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
awhile
more
dry
hoppy
than
other
bocks
ive
had
noticeable
warming
from
the
alcohol
after
you
swallow
o
i
tried
it
to
see
what
the
most
rated
beer
in
this
style
tasted
ike
it
was
differant
and
will
try
it
again
overall
rogue
dead
guy
ale
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
have
often
overlooked
since
its
been
around
forever
and
ive
had
it
tons
of
times
that
being
said
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
particularly
when
i
want
something
drinkable
and
tasty
beautiful
fluffy
creamy
white
head
on
an
orangish
hued
ale
with
a
slightly
hazy
body
didnt
get
too
much
out
of
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
rich
and
extremely
malty
with
a
thick
full
mouthfeel
theres
a
very
strong
hop
presence
that
lingers
throughout
the
sip
hard
to
place
exact
flavors
this
beer
seems
to
be
all
over
the
place
but
is
extremely
tasty
and
satisfying
a
cross
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
amber
my
only
complaint
would
be
its
muddled
undefined
flavor
that
doesnt
quite
allow
anything
to
stand
out
definitely
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
return
to
regularly
rogue
nailed
this
beer
and
it
is
as
good
now
as
it
was
15
years
ago
even
with
all
of
the
great
new
beers
coming
out
this
is
still
a
really
good
beer
o
overall
i
find
that
no
single
characteristic
of
dead
guy
ale
stands
out
on
its
own
if
broken
down
into
its
specific
categories
ill
probably
forget
it
in
a
few
weeks
but
as
a
whole
i
find
dga
to
be
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
worth
the
6
70
price
tag
i
payed
for
a
650ml
bottle
but
if
it
dropped
into
the
56
range
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
a
couple
to
have
on
hand
it
still
has
a
very
interesting
taste
and
i
cant
fault
it
for
being
stored
as
it
was
i
cracked
it
open
and
poured
into
a
shaker
and
still
got
plenty
of
head
id
just
like
to
add
that
i
can
really
taste
the
munich
malts
i
might
up
the
score
a
hair
got
this
beer
in
a
growler
at
the
liquor
store
i
work
at
part
time
nice
in
copper
tone
smells
a
little
malty
taste
like
your
average
helles
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
great
mouthful
feeling
and
overall
isnt
bad
recommend
this
beer
to
a
good
bock
enthusiast
another
great
brew
from
rogue
ps
i
find
serving
temp
to
be
especially
important
in
this
brew
o
outstanding
beer
with
a
great
taste
that
can
be
expected
from
a
premium
craft
ale
great
balance
of
smell
taste
and
feel
and
is
a
beer
that
i
would
definitely
consider
drinking
many
more
times
in
the
future
as
a
maibock
this
beer
is
all
malts
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
my
first
recommendation
is
to
let
this
one
warm
up
before
you
begin
to
drink
it
served
ice
cold
the
dead
guy
ale
can
taste
like
a
cheap
gas
station
beer
but
once
it
warms
all
of
the
deep
malty
character
come
out
it
pours
a
honey
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
sweet
caramel
aroma
the
taste
is
all
malts
with
big
sweet
malt
and
caramel
notes
and
a
nice
depth
that
lingers
on
the
palate
this
is
a
definitely
a
complex
beer
for
a
maibock
and
a
great
counterpoint
to
all
the
ipas
i
have
been
drinking
lately
it
has
deceptively
high
alcohol
content
for
the
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
dead
guy
ale
was
a
nicely
balanced
and
outstanding
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldencopper
color
has
a
decent
head
but
dissipates
rather
quick
pretty
good
carbonation
and
the
lacing
is
alright
has
a
bit
of
a
malty
sweet
apple
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
not
bad
and
not
too
much
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
1finger
off
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
when
sipped
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
malty
grains
with
a
hint
of
caramel
with
maybe
apricot
pretty
much
was
the
taste
as
well
as
with
a
hint
of
spice
good
balance
of
flavor
and
smooth
to
drink
no
harsh
or
bad
aftertaste
was
noted
overall
a
fine
brew
o
i
generally
dont
like
bock
styles
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
not
something
id
do
to
on
a
regular
basis
but
enjoyable
o
a
nice
quality
beer
with
a
6
5
kick
sign
me
up
o
this
had
a
unique
sour
malty
smell
yet
a
unlike
sweet
taste
which
i
said
wow
to
on
my
first
sip
as
i
was
expecting
something
different
this
turned
out
to
be
really
enjoyable
with
a
complex
aroma
and
flavor
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
and
one
of
my
favourite
american
brews
at
present
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
an
excellent
ale
perfect
for
cold
days
or
nights
spent
relaxing
o
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
beer
pretty
different
from
the
other
ales
that
i
had
but
very
enjoyable
d
a
must
try
love
this
brewers
originality
and
information
for
each
brew
they
care
overall
not
bad
besides
not
being
able
to
smell
anything
very
sweet
and
carbonated
it
poured
an
inviting
yet
hazy
honey
brown
with
a
beige
colored
head
it
smelt
like
sweet
crackers
and
caramel
a
good
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
honey
with
more
caramel
definitely
enjoyable
even
with
the
upfront
bitterness
it
was
drinkable
and
balanced
so
far
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
rogue
overall
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
its
a
bit
too
sweet
and
maltforward
for
my
taste
decent
for
what
it
is
though
overall
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
my
germanstyle
bias
could
partly
bee
a
factor
in
this
recognition
however
its
just
what
i
expect
a
worldclass
beer
to
be
its
not
all
fruity
and
bitter
like
some
ipas
its
not
watered
down
by
any
means
like
mainstream
american
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
at
6
5
abv
its
outstandingly
palatable
the
taste
is
something
of
an
amber
ale
cross
with
german
brew
tones
this
is
my
favorite
beer
in
the
usa
o
my
first
experience
with
this
style
definitely
not
something
i
would
have
every
day
it
was
perhaps
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
i
normally
dont
drink
a
22
oz
beer
alone
so
i
had
a
bit
left
over
a
decent
enough
brew
better
suited
to
the
fall
in
my
opinion
overall
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
at
beer
dinners
pubs
and
even
as
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
this
is
a
complex
beer
and
a
great
example
in
this
style
it
continues
to
grow
on
me
through
every
tasting
o
ive
had
this
sitting
in
my
basement
for
a
few
months
now
my
friends
rave
about
this
beer
and
ive
been
skeptical
to
try
it
because
im
more
of
an
ipa
guy
i
can
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
this
beer
executes
on
all
levels
and
ill
be
looking
forward
to
having
more
of
these
in
the
cooler
seasons
tried
at
a
pub
in
downtown
calgary
on
a
nice
sunny
saturday
afternoon
pours
up
a
honey
golden
graham
hue
with
a
moderate
amount
of
beige
head
aroma
was
sweet
fairly
floral
spicy
noble
hops
taste
was
a
really
complex
mosaic
of
light
caramel
aromatic
biscuit
lemon
dry
chocolate
powder
orange
honey
and
tobacco
with
ample
hop
spice
and
subtle
bitterness
i
was
struck
by
how
integrated
the
flavors
were
one
had
to
really
focus
to
pick
them
out
and
the
overall
impression
is
one
of
a
floralherbspice
bouquet
with
a
honey
sweet
backdrop
if
rogue
was
going
for
integration
rather
than
staggering
things
on
the
palate
they
hit
a
home
run
here
anywaylast
night
i
made
my
usual
beer
run
after
workand
decided
to
finally
check
out
some
dead
guy
ale15
bucks
a
6er
upon
getting
homei
popped
one
right
away
and
poured
it
in
a
standard
pint
glassand
right
away
was
taken
by
the
beautifulslightly
amberalmost
copper
colorok
looks
very
nicenext
i
gave
it
the
ole
sniffer
testsmelled
malty
and
quite
hoppywhich
led
to
my
mouth
watering
like
a
lion
looking
at
a
zebrait
had
a
decent
headbut
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
have
to
say
as
soon
as
i
tasted
itthe
less
then
stellar
head
meant
nothing
at
allquite
simply
this
is
one
top
notch
brewwith
hints
of
carmel
maybe
a
little
toffee
alsovery
malty
hoppy
just
like
it
smelled
so
in
closingmy
beer
snob
friends
were
right
on
the
money
this
time
hehe
rouge
dead
guy
ale
is
a
wonderful
brewand
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
beer
fridge
overall
a
good
example
of
a
maibock
i
have
had
better
but
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
bunch
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
enjoyable
oi
cant
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
many
years
to
try
dead
guy
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
did
the
beer
may
not
have
much
flash
or
any
bret
in
there
but
what
it
lacks
in
pizazz
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
and
balance
from
the
first
sniff
to
the
last
drop
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
a
wellmade
example
of
oldschool
microbrewing
o
the
quintessential
maibock
overall
a
very
satisfying
beer
loaded
with
flavor
you
will
always
find
a
dead
guy
in
my
fridge
at
home
i
honestly
dont
know
that
i
would
want
to
drink
it
all
night
but
it
would
be
a
great
beer
anytime
as
part
of
a
lineup
t
nice
good
well
balanced
maibock
hoppy
brown
sugar
great
carbonation
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
overly
hopped
for
an
ale
which
is
nice
has
just
a
hint
of
pine
just
good
beer
this
actually
was
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
not
very
lagery
but
it
imitates
the
style
very
well
with
its
breadiness
yet
still
with
that
ale
light
body
a
really
enjoyable
beer
for
those
not
into
bitterness
or
the
grassy
hops
of
other
german
style
lagers
this
balances
that
well
being
an
ale
blech
beerloveandhoppiness
com
overall
yikes
i
normally
dont
see
dms
in
commercially
available
beers
but
thats
rogue
for
you
i
used
to
like
this
brand
and
sometime
i
will
give
it
another
review
but
this
one
is
terrible
im
not
one
to
dump
beer
but
i
have
good
stuff
in
the
fridge
that
id
rather
drink
this
beer
was
infected
i
dont
usualy
drink
ales
unless
its
and
ipa
or
something
of
the
sort
but
this
was
my
brothers
so
i
was
willing
to
try
and
glad
i
did
nice
malty
taste
with
a
lingering
finish
that
was
a
plesant
flavor
in
my
mouth
not
too
bad
now
i
just
need
to
try
the
double
dead
guy
ale
there
was
nothing
special
about
this
ale
im
new
at
this
but
it
was
very
lagerish
to
me
overall
i
dont
have
any
particularly
strong
feelings
here
the
beer
is
not
noticeably
malty
or
hoppy
doesnt
have
any
particularly
strong
flavor
a
good
beer
but
could
not
find
anything
to
really
like
or
dislike
about
it
so
i
guess
im
neutral
might
buy
this
again
might
not
pour
was
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
cloudy
orangebrown
color
was
very
nice
thick
white
head
reached
2
12
fingers
and
hung
around
it
was
hard
to
get
a
definable
aroma
malty
sweetness
is
what
came
through
and
maybe
some
mild
hops
taste
is
where
i
really
fell
for
this
ale
sweet
with
a
tangy
after
taste
some
bitters
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
malty
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
with
a
medium
smooth
drinkablity
overall
its
a
very
fine
maibock
great
taste
decent
abv
and
it
looks
good
in
a
pint
glass
overall
ok
brew
but
not
my
first
choice
and
probably
will
not
buy
again
o
ive
never
been
impressed
with
dead
guy
ale
it
tastes
like
they
took
a
great
barley
wine
and
watered
it
down
which
is
especially
infuriating
considering
the
rest
of
rogues
offerings
definitely
decent
overall
but
probably
my
least
favorite
from
rogue
this
is
really
just
a
standard
malty
bock
nothing
very
interesting
o
my
experiences
with
rogue
as
a
brewery
have
been
fairly
limited
maple
bacon
ale
and
nothing
else
that
has
been
particularly
memorable
but
i
made
a
point
of
hunting
this
out
after
friends
had
recommended
it
as
their
favorite
of
rogues
offerings
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
is
something
id
take
over
most
common
bar
offerings
but
i
dont
know
that
id
pick
this
up
over
many
of
the
other
options
i
have
in
the
craft
aisle
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
can
already
tell
that
the
sweetness
of
this
one
is
going
to
wear
on
me
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
and
i
dont
know
that
id
sign
up
to
enjoy
this
one
again
o
well
done
for
the
style
the
nose
had
me
a
little
skeptical
but
rebounded
nicely
with
the
flavor
and
feel
im
not
in
the
mood
for
this
style
often
but
when
i
am
i
will
certainly
consider
this
one
o
i
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
a
maibock
is
supposed
to
be
and
frankly
i
still
dont
know
this
beer
has
all
kinds
of
stuff
going
on
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
would
say
i
enjoyed
it
i
really
did
not
like
this
beer
way
too
nasty
and
bitter
it
has
a
poor
head
and
for
a
bock
beer
it
really
lacked
any
malt
taste
i
thought
that
it
was
over
hopped
all
in
all
i
just
did
not
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
has
a
cidery
taste
that
is
disgusting
to
me
if
all
they
did
was
use
sugar
to
built
up
the
alcohol
they
were
wasting
the
effort
awesome
this
beer
is
a
real
go
to
for
me
always
delicious
the
malts
and
hops
are
mixed
just
about
as
perfectly
as
can
be
on
the
palate
color
is
a
darkish
brown
that
just
makes
my
mouth
water
looking
at
it
while
the
smell
may
be
lacking
a
little
the
taste
is
a
real
mouthful
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
and
beer
in
general
once
in
a
while
you
can
live
without
the
hop
zing
element
and
get
back
to
basics
this
hearty
ale
proves
that
overall
a
very
nice
offering
from
rogue
not
surprising
this
is
their
pride
and
joy
and
most
heavily
distributed
smooth
drinking
good
flavors
only
complaint
is
from
the
nose
which
is
a
minor
complaint
o
definitely
the
best
bock
ive
ever
tried
seemingly
simple
beer
that
is
truly
enjoyable
thank
you
rogue
o
an
ale
disguised
as
a
lager
none
of
the
typical
fruitiness
associated
with
an
ale
really
lets
the
malt
shine
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
for
perfect
balance
had
this
in
my
hospitality
beverages
course
apparently
this
beer
is
brewed
like
a
lager
but
uses
an
ale
yeast
we
were
given
this
as
a
helle
lager
but
it
was
more
similar
to
a
boch
style
and
was
to
dark
and
hoppy
to
be
a
true
helles
lager
still
tasted
great
though
overall
just
bought
a
6pack
may
revise
this
review
once
im
finished
with
it
not
much
experience
with
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
feel
like
it
will
grow
on
me
even
more
as
well
its
a
very
warm
tart
malty
brew
im
having
a
really
hard
time
describing
it
but
its
very
well
balanced
the
dead
guy
ale
from
rogues
was
a
very
interesting
beer
the
beer
had
a
great
amber
appearance
the
smell
had
notes
of
caramel
and
pumpkin
flavors
the
taste
was
very
malty
and
had
pumpkin
flavors
the
body
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
delicious
but
different
beer
o
not
bad
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
this
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
a
smooth
drinker
that
has
a
nice
amount
of
balanced
flavor
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
and
not
have
to
think
about
side
note
as
i
was
drinking
this
i
couldnt
stop
thinking
how
darn
good
a
barrel
aged
version
would
be
of
this
after
googling
apparently
thats
the
john
john
dead
guy
i
will
be
looking
for
it
o
what
a
treat
always
this
beer
is
so
simple
and
so
good
not
the
richest
or
the
most
exotic
however
it
has
become
my
current
signature
beer
satisfying
drinkable
as
a
single
or
for
a
few
in
a
quiet
moment
although
chilled
properly
it
is
also
an
excellent
roomtemp
ale
if
you
like
to
get
the
full
measure
of
texture
scent
and
flavor
be
sure
to
enjoy
from
a
wide
mouth
pref
glass
container
as
the
aroma
is
a
substantial
part
of
the
experience
overall
an
ok
beer
but
pretty
unspectacular
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
it
might
be
something
to
pick
up
on
occasion
all
that
i
really
have
to
say
that
if
you
dont
try
this
beer
you
dont
know
what
you
are
missing
and
it
needs
to
be
on
your
bucket
list
thank
you
rogue
now
get
out
there
and
drink
some
different
drinks
mix
it
up
but
stop
drinking
fcking
jaeger
bombs
and
drink
good
beer
life
is
short
enough
dont
make
it
even
shorter
drinking
that
complete
garbage
overall
definitely
on
my
radar
for
another
go
around
highly
recommended
overall
great
beer
that
i
will
consider
buying
much
more
of
if
rogue
allows
for
it
o
killer
beer
its
sessionably
lager
like
with
a
full
hop
character
and
slight
malt
sweetness
that
gives
it
balance
and
good
flavor
id
buy
a
6
of
this
any
time
overall
im
glad
for
this
beer
ill
buy
more
and
an
added
bonusnow
i
have
a
dead
guy
ale
growler
o
well
balanced
and
very
flavourful
that
abv
is
very
well
hidden
i
like
this
beer
better
from
the
bomber
or
at
least
this
time
around
i
do
thats
probably
psychological
btw
but
for
some
beers
bombers
are
just
king

you

the

is
also
abundantly
sweet
upfront
with
an
astringent
bitterness
roaring
up
behind
but
then
settling
in
to
balance
things
off
no
wonder
this
is
so
popular
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
fruity
yeast
isnt
really
my
kind
of
thing
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
else
to
offer
besides
sweet
malts
and
some
bitter
but
unflavourful
hops
overall
the
beer
is
enjoyable
i
would
purchase
it
again
feel
medium

smooth
with
a
creamy

avglong
finish
great
beer
with
a
personality
of
its
own
highly
recommended
very
awesome
beer
a
bold
beer
with
very
big
flavors
i
am
a
homebrewer
but
i
still
have
trouble
being
able
to
tell
what
it
is
about
some
beers
this
is
one
of
those
very
malty
taste
like
part
of
the
malt
protiens
did
not
convert
to
simple
sugars
for
fermentation
thats
not
a
bad
thing
the
flavor
is
great
im
just
not
sure
if
that
is
even
it
whatever
it
is
it
works
overall
certainly
a
hearty
brew
for
sure
nice
balance
i
have
never
had
this
style
before
but
i
did
enjoyed
dead
guy
ale
had
this
at
the
royal
bear
tavern
light
amber
in
color
and
a
little
hazy
thin
white
head
toasty
malt
aromatics
tastes
of
toasted
malt
too
lightly
sweet
followed
by
a
good
but
not
overly
punch
of
hops
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
lightmedium
carbonation
very
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
balance
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
recommended
to
try
i
do
not
believe
i
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
if
this
is
indicitive
of
the
style
i
think
i
will
like
it
a
lot
check
this
one
out
this
maibock
style
ale
intrigues
the
senses
with
its
beautiful
color
and
to
me
rich
aroma
the
taste
isnt
too
strong
but
neither
is
it
too
weak
i
recommend
this
beer
to
both
the
mildentry
enthusiast
to
the
extreme
enthusiast
in
my
personal
opinion
you
cant
go
wrong
if
your
hanging
with
a
dead
guy
awesome
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
at
wine
country
shreveport
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
finger
of
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
really
nice
mild
sweet
sugary
malt
aromas
taste
is
bitter
hop
followed
but
the
sweet
malts
the
hops
are
surprising
since
they
were
barely
detected
in
the
aroma
but
really
well
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
an
awesome
brew
oan
interesting
beer
not
what
i
expected
but
very
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
expected
something
bigger
and
maybe
even
somewhat
smoky
but
once
i
reminded
myself
that
this
is
a
lager
i
was
realized
how
full
of
taste
and
smooth
lagers
can
be
yum
yum
i
will
go
back
to
this
one
for
sure
did
i
mention
it
was
only
1
99
for
a
bomber
i
grabbed
a
few
stop
into
mccanns
pub
and
grill
in
astoria
ny
and
try
one
for
yourself
overall
pretty
good
but
nothing
special
i
wish
the
breadiness
was
weaker
and
the
other
tastes
were
a
bit
stronger
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
well
rounded
beer
all
the
features
blend
well
together
and
this
is
very
drinkable

make

a

not
worth

very
nice
must
try
overall
a
good
beer
and
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
it
seems
rather
disjointed
i
guess
i
have
a
different
opinion
about
this
beer
than
most
people
part
of
my
dislike
may
simply
be
the
style
i
will
have
to
try
more
maibocks
to
be
sure
but
this
one
hits
you
over
the
head
with
bready
malts
and
then
hits
you
over
the
head
again
with
intense
honey
flavor
that
somehow
manages
not
to
blend
very
well
with
the
bitter
hoppy
finish
the
flavors
were
disjointed
separate
and
it
just
didnt
seem
to
me
like
a
very
well
crafted
beer
ps
free
range

what
the
fuck
is
that
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the

good

rogue
dead
guy
ale

this
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
the
nose
is
similar
to
a
traditional
brown
ale
with
charred
grain
comes
across
the
palate
smoothly
it
has
a
light
caramel
flavors
with
a
sweet
malty
clean
lingering
finish
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
bock
styles
overall
lives
up
to
everything
ive
heard
about
dead
guy
a
must
try
o
great
overall
beer
i
liked
the
overall
look
and
taste
of
the
beer
it
reminded
more
of
a
homebrew
than
a
typical
craft
beer
good
drinking
higher
alcohal
than
most
session
beers
but
much
better
tasting
without
hitting
the
double
digit
alcohal
levels
of
alot
of
newer
craft
beers
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
i
would
only
drink
it
in
moderation
as
its
pretty
sweet
this
would
go
good
along
with
steak
or
a
dessert
the
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
great
and
this
is
a
unique
beer
dead
guy
ale
grew
on
me
throughout
the
glass
but
i
still
dont
quite
believe
its
worth
the
2
79
i
paid
for
the
bottle
slightly
overpriced
regardless
of
that
though
this
is
a
tasty
beer
it
looks
great
it
feels
great
and
it
has
a
very
solid
taste
thats
fairly
mild
yet
keeps
you
drinking
this
one
pours
up
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
white
head
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
primarily
pine
floral
and
resin
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
upfront
but
not
overpoweringly
so
the
finish
is
a
mild
bitterness
well
balanced
but
mild
overall
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
nothing
wonderful
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
i
would
recommend
it
personal
rate
3
75
o
this
is
really
a
great
readily
available
sixpack
beer
lots
of
great
sweet
malt
character
but
the
alcohol
presence
really
cuts
down
the
sweetness
to
make
this
incredible
drinkable
o
an
interesting
mix
of
a
lager
style
and
an
ale
yeast
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
o
a
very
tasty
bock
style
beer
lots
of
flavor
good
balance
and
high
drinkability
an
excellent
offering
from
rogue
medium
bodied
a
little
slick
on
the
palate
but
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
dangerous
it
does
not
have
the
alcohol
volume
of
a
session
beer
but
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
will
tell
you
that
if
you
session
drink
the
brew
you
will
end
up
like
the
guy
on
the
bottle
there
are
stronger
beers
but
this
would
be
the
whiskey
of
beers
in
my
book
not
by
taste
but
by
effect
price
point
9
996pk
12
oz
bottles
this
was
the
first
beer
id
ever
had
from
rogue
in
my
favorite
early
days
of
drinking
craft
beer
coming
back
to
it
was
mighty
pleasurable
a
good
drinker
with
some
assertive
character
to
it
thats
not
going
to
knock
you
down
o
this
beer
represents
a
conundrum
for
me
its
the
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
daily
drinker
i
envisioned
it
would
be
but
its
priced
just
out
of
said
middle
of
the
road
daily
drinker
range
at
126
pk
for
that
reason
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
over
offerings
from
sierra
nevada
new
belgium
or
the
like
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
isnt
flashy
at
all
just
balanced
and
wellput
together
great
beer
overall
and
a
must
have
for
any
fan
of
ales
poured
from

amber
with

generous
2
finger
off
white
head
smell
is
on
the
sweet
end
but
not
overpowering
malty
and
a
bit
of
carmel
taste
is
rather
unique
my
first
mailbock
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
front
end
is
loaded
with
carmel
malts
that
give
way
to
a
nice
hop
balance
very
well
balanced
beer
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
picked
up
a
bready
nutty
profile
as
well
that
is
subtle
feel
is
nice
and
full
with
good

silky

overall
a
very
surprising
brew
balanced
and
full
of

nice

sweet

with

very
sessionable

complex
with
its
taste

definite
must

decent
beer
here
nothing
too
special
or
overthetop
excellent
but
still
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
really
like
this
total
wine
has
the
growlers
on
sale
for
14
but
i
opted
for
the
12
ozer
first
to
try
it
hope
theyre
still
there
when
i
go
back
i
read
the
label
but
it
didnt
sink
in
that
its
a
maibock
style
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
good
maibock
perfect
for
the
season
dark
orange
clear
beer
with
lasting
beige
head
intense
us
hop
nose
with
hints
of
chocolate
limes
when
i
say
hints
i
mean
completely
unsubtle
flavors
really
nice
in
mouth
got
good
strong
mouthfeel
with
malts
and
alcohol
coming
through
then
smooth
choc
lime
finish
with
drying
intense
hoppiness
superb
with
good
lasting
flavors
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
harvest
fine
wine
spirits
in
hartford
ct
poured
into
a
baird
pint
glass
a
strange
orangewheat
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
beautifully
subtle
yet
complex
smell
of
exotic
fruit
like
mangostar
fruitapricot
with
a
bit
of
hops
behind
it
the
flavor
is
mild
and
harks
back
to
the
smell
easy
on
the
throat
yet
memorable
a
smooth
drinking
beer
with
lots
of
body
and
flavor
to
support
it
another
quality
beer
from
a
quality
brewer
like
rogue
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
hazy
copper
with
an
eggshell
colored
head
there
are
some
visible
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
head
retains
very
well
dissipating
slowly
and
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
aromas
of
sweet
and
bready
malts
with
some
earthy
and
floral
hop
aromas
the
malt
profile
is
strong
with
the
bready
and
mildly
sweet
notes
theres
some
good
back
end
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
bring
some
floral
and
spicy
characteristics
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
sticky
and
dry
this
allows
the
aftertaste
to
linger
for
a
little
while
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
to
get
around
to
trying
it
it
has
a
nice
strong
but
not
overbearing
flavor
and
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
typical
ale
at
least
the
ones
ive
been
drinking
o
impressive
a
little
pricey
but
still
a
great
refreshing
beer
great
for
the
fall
season
serving
type
growler
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
nice
version
of
it
first
had
this
back
in
college
but
most
recently
had
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
to
a
tulip
glass
beautiful
amber
color
with
small
white
head
on
top
this
one
has
a
very
solid
aroma
caramel
biscuits
pine
toffee
citrus
doesnt
go
down
particularly
easy
for
only
6
6
but
a
nice
changeup
flavor
is
biscuity
malts
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
good
bit
of
hefty
bitter
and
booze
for
the
abv
overall
i
liked
this
but
not
over
the
top
on
it
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
with
lots
of
malt
and
just
enough
hops
to
give
a
little
kick
to
the
finish
its
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
try
a
lot
more
maibocks
and
again
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
rogue
brews
if
you
are
looking
for
a
great
semidark
ale
look
no
further
rogues
dead
guy
will
steal
your
love
for
plenty
of
other
beers
and
capture
your
attention
quick
o
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
would
soon
rather
get
better
beer
for
the
money
overall
a
very
good
beer
cheers
the
smoothtextured
brew
tastes
primarily
of
caramelcovered
pears
mixed
with
a
small
amount
of
dried
prunes
brown
sugar
sprinkles
and
finishes
with
an
abrupt
yet
satisfyingly
drying
herbal
and
floral
hopping
finish
memorable
for
the
profound
transformation
from
bock
sweetness
to
a
balanced
pale
ale
kind
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
o
easily
the
best
rogue
beer
ive
had
so
far
my
only
complaint
is
that
in
korea
it
only
comes
in
pissy
12
ounce
bottles
definitely
one
to
have
again
though
good
job
overall
more
of
a
sentimental
favorite
than
anything
else
this
beer
really
caught
me
off
guard
and
brought
me
into
craft
maybe
its
the
evolution
of
my
taste
buds
to
bigger
and
better
things
but
its
not
as
incredible
as
i
remember
still
i
really
enjoy
the
beer
its
got
good
flavor
its
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
o
this
is
great
no
wonder
everyone
loves
it
my
bottle
is
about
8
months
old
very
good
solid
easy
to
drink
yet
flavorful
and
bold
beer
o
note
to
rogue
dont
change
a
thing
here
what
an
excellent
maibock
cheers
overall
quite
interesting
beer
the
taste
lingers
quite
a
while
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
as
other
posts
have
emphasized
the
6
5
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
it
is
hard
to
just
have
one
so
after
you
get
your
first
plan
on
hanging
out
for
a
while
overall
one
of
the
best
maibocks
i
have
had
dead
guy
ale
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
will
appeal
to
most
beer
lovers
at
6
5
abv
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
have
two
or
three
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
one
of
the
better
big
beers
that
is
sold
rogues
flagship
beer
is
indeed
a
fantastic
beer
it
pours
a
nice
deep
orange
with
a
slightly
fruity
biscuity
fragrance
taste
delivers
on
the
scent
in
spades
even
adding
in
a
slightly
nutty
touch
its
a
unique
brew
that
can
easily
find
its
way
into
any
beer
drinkers
fridge
my
favorite
beer
not
much
else
needed
to
say
i
could
drink
10
in
a
row
its
so
good
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cold
winter
night
flavor
is
amazing
banana
citrus
hops
slight
bitterness
slight
sweetness
nothing
else
is
like
it
just
an
amazing
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
finger
and
a
half
worth
of
head
the
smell
is
quite
hoppy
if
you
ask
me
with
light
toasted
malt
and
bread
the
taste
virtually
follows
the
smell
tastes
hoppy
some
light
malt
some
wet
bread
and
slightly
strong
skunk
weird
for
the
type
eh
it
all
piled
together
nicely
thought
the
mouthfeel
somewhat
follows
though
it
allows
more
of
the
skunk
to
come
through
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
seriously
i
would
buy
this
for
any
occasion
though
at
2
50
a
bottle
the
prices
are
a
bit
too
high
for
what
you
get
drop
your
prices
and
youll
consistently
have
my
and
im
sure
thousands
of
others
business
this
beer
was
wonderful
using
ale
yeast
for
a
lager
stye
seemed
to
have
worked
well
for
rogue
probably
the
best
maibock
ive
had
so
far
bottom
line
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
after
a
long
day
or
just
hangin
with
my
fellow
beer
geeks
dead
guy
is
a
wonderful
all
around
beer
with
aromas
of
malty
sweet
carmel
and
hints
of
fruitness
that
reminds
of
fall
weather
its
the
tastes
that
packs
the
punch
though
wonderful
complex
notes
of
malt
and
hops
spices
of
nutmeg
and
clove
a
great
bitter
finish
that
hop
lovers
can
respect
cheers
to
rogue
for
their
dead
guy
ale
this
brewery
also
does
some
distilling
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
of
thier
products
enjoy
had
this
ontap
at
least
a
year
ago
and
actually
like
to
bottled
version
better
o
a
good
beer
but
not
in
my
opinion
a
great
one
the
sweetness
is
a
little
overwhelming
and
i
dont
know
that
i
would
want
more
than
one
or
two
o
it
has
been
along
time
since
ive
had
this
but
its
still
pretty
good
not
a
hugely
impressive
style
to
be
honest
but
rogue
does
it
really
well
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
properly
masked
and
it
finishes
solid
perhaps
not
a
personal
go
to
beer
or
style
but
worth
having
once
in
awhile
still
i
think
its
just
above
average
hayward
abbey
rating
83
o
overall
possibly
my
favorite
beer
to
date
great
in
every
aspect
overall
you
have
to
be
kidding
yourself
not
to
grab
a
bottle
i
have
enjoyed
it
beginning
to
end
and
loved
every
bit
of
it
salud
o
overall
its
a
very
well
put
together
brew
i
think
this
beer
is
exactly
what
theyd
hoped
it
would
be
for
me
personally
i
like
bold
or
more
robust
beers
but
if
you
like
more
of
a
mild
but
flavorful
brew
this
one
is
definitely
worthy
and
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
mug
in
may
seasonable
aroma
was
something
id
equate
with
springtime
effervescent
flowery
and
happy
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
case
of
this
every
may
and
being
quite
happy
with
it
this
beer
is
a
great
signifier
of
the
change
in
seasons
the
one
downside
is
ill
never
be
able
to
drink
it
in
months
that
arent
may
o
nice
brew
very
easy
to
drink
i
dint
think
this
beer
is
going
to
floor
anyone
but
ill
have
another
o
may
not
completly
stand
up
to
its
unbelievable
reputation
but
is
a
very
very
good
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
go
back
to
time
and
time
again
o
this
is
a
good
session
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
well
balanced
characteristics
make
it
so
you
dont
get
tired
of
drinking
it
maybe
it
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
skeleton
on
the
bottle
but
i
always
want
this
beer
around
halloween
and
the
fall
season
totally
unlike
any
other
bock
ive
tried
and
certainly
a
departure
from
traditional
bocks
but
this
is
a
very
unique
ale
that
has
become
a
bit
of
a
legend
in
the
usa
the
smell
is
odd
to
me
sweet
and
malty
but
also
spiced
to
a
degree
and
hopped
like
only
a
west
coast
beer
can
be
the
flavor
features
heavy
hops
on
the
back
end
which
is
not
common
in
a
spring
bock
the
malts
do
the
rest
of
the
work
layering
in
a
ton
of
complexity
to
this
i
also
get
some
woody
notes
and
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
mouthfeel
works
its
heavier
in
the
body
but
the
carbonation
is
very
high
which
makes
for
a
pleasant
experience
not
like
many
others
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
a
whole
6pack
just
gets
too
heavy
and
sweet
after
a
bunch
of
them
but
one
or
two
every
so
often
is
really
nice
o
a
good
beer
to
drink
regularly
except
for
the
expensive
price
tag
if
this
was
regular
price
i
would
like
it
much
better
flavors
mingle
well
and
serves
as
a
well
developed
helles
lager
i
want
to
try
the
other
dead
guy
line
up
but
this
will
probably
be
my
last
time
picking
this
up
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
reviewed
this
and
it
pours
a
very
hazy
light
amber
hue
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
toffee
maltsbuttered
popcorncaramel
treacle
and
bananna
cakethe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiedmalty
and
suits
nicely
for
the
style
with
a
big
malt
backbone
with
tastes
of
caramel
candytoffee
treaclefruit
cakehoney
soaked
raisins
and
finished
with
a
mix
of
plum
jam
and
an
earthy
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
is
nicely
balanced
due
to
the
big
malt
backbone
and
overall
i
like
this
brew
as
its
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
the
malts
making
their
presence
known
as
what
a
good
helles
should
do
and
overall
i
like
this
brew
and
glad
i
revisited
it
as
i
could
drink
it
all
day
and
the
perfect
brew
for
an
octoberfest
thats
not
in
germany
cheers
o
a
lager
style
brewed
with
ale
yeast
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
for
sure
smells
and
tastes
lake
a
lager
which
is
even
more
interesting
solid
brew
try
it
out
this
beer
remains
one
of
my
all
time
favoriates
i
constantly
recomend
dead
guy
to
people
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
eary
to
drink
beer
with
rewarding
aftertase
i
noties
a
stightly
metalic
flavor
in
this
beer
that
has
grown
on
me
having
had
this
beer
both
out
of
the
bottle
and
on
tap
i
would
say
that
it
is
fantastic
both
ways
the
only
knock
on
it
is
the
price
its
generally
very
expensive
i
would
purchase
it
much
more
if
it
was
not
quite
as
expensive
not
bad
but
a
bit
disappointing
after
hearing
so
much
talk
of
how
great
it
is
a
nice
malty
character
and
fantastic
mouthfeel
but
the
hops
have
gone
missing
some
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
but
not
much
the
only
culprit
i
can
imagine
is
age
this
has
probably
been
sitting
around
over
here
for
too
long
it
obviously
doesnt
help
that
there
is
no
bottle
dating
to
act
as
a
guide
still
a
decent
brew
that
deserves
to
be
sampled
white
head
the
color
is
a
beautiful
amber
brownish
the
carbonation
is
just
right
smell
is
basic
but
that
is
why
it
is
good
the
first
sip
tickles
my
tongue
leaving
a
very
happy
and
relaxed
mouth
afterward
i
have
no
intention
to
be
in
a
hurry
with
this
as
it
is
a
good
secret
to
keep
no
need
to
tell
you
what
this
brew
tastes
like
as
it
is
known
that
you
just
need
to
be
here
you
know
a
good
bartender
when
final
grade
4
27
a
very
high
a
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
praise
in
ba
circles
and
now
having
tried
it
i
see
that
this
praise
is
entirely
justified
this
stuff
is
delicious
perfectly
balanced
and
deceptively
drinkable
for
a
6
6
brew
it
is
not
a
traditional
maibock
as
it
definitely
possesses
some
features
that
seem
decidedly
pale
aleinspired
but
even
if
you
cant
stuff
dead
guy
ale
into
a
neat
little
labelled
box
its
a
brew
that
no
selfrespecting
beer
geek
should
hesitate
to
try
overall
this
is
really
good
compared
to
other
maibocks
ive
had
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
no
sign
of
a
bottled
date
on
rogue
beers
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
one
inch
white
head
with
attractive
lacing
smell
is
clove
brown
sugar
lemon
pepper
and
figs
taste
is
very
sweet
brown
sugar
clove
and
fig
dominate
body
is
medium
enough
life
not
overly
dry
and
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
for
malt
lovers
i
got
this
beer
at
the
continental
tavern
in
yardley
pa
not
knowing
what
to
expect
i
was
taken
aback
immediately
by
the
two
highest
qualities
of
this
beer
its
craftsmanship
and
its
drinkability
this
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
enjoy
and
is
downright
tasty
as
opposed
to
savory
i
will
definitely
look
out
for
this
ale
next
time
i
see
it
noticed
this
6pack
tucked
away
in
the
corner
of
the
refrig
at
my
local
liquor
store
sporting
a
14
99
price
tag
had
to
try
it
just
to
see
what
that
price
buys
you
these
days
i
wasnt
disappointed
but
not
exactly
knocked
over
a
solid
balanced
beer
that
doesnt
carry
any
one
defining
characteristic
more
maltish
in
taste
than
anything
certainly
not
hopheavy
its
the
mix
that
does
the
rick
here
and
makes
this
an
eminently
drinkable
brew
hard
to
have
just
one
it
could
be
a
good
staple
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
cost
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
rich
taste
o
i
havent
had
too
many
rogue
beers
up
to
this
point
but
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
thus
far
its
smooth
and
very
drinkable
with
a
pleasant
refreshing
taste
that
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
to
drink
the
taste
does
an
excellent
job
of
having
the
malts
hops
sweetness
and
bitterness
all
fit
together
beautifully
i
can
certainly
see
why
this
beer
is
available
yearround
as
it
would
be
easy
to
enjoy
no
matter
the
season
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
it
smells
of
clove
and
clean
malt
this
beer
has
an
interesting
character
up
front
is
the
spicy
earthy
clove
notes
the
middle
is
kind
of
bread
like
and
it
ends
a
bit
of
a
bite
it
stays
on
the
palate
this
beer
wants
you
to
drink
more
of
it
and
i
will
appearance
is
dark
copper
to
light
brown
with
an
orange
hue
the
moderate
head
doesnt
last
very
long
scents
are
of
fresh
baked
bread
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
grass
the
taste
is
mainly
roasted
malt
bready
and
nutty
and
a
bit
sweet
but
with
a
hint
of
grassy
and
floral
notes
the
flavors
all
work
really
well
together
very
low
bitterness
and
very
drinkable
solidly
good
allaround
this
might
make
a
good
beer
to
transition
someone
into
the
craft
beer
world
from
bmc
products
overall
a
nice

o
i
have
to
agree
with
the
majority
on
this
one
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
full
flavored
without
overdoing
it
yet
clean
and
crisp
this
makes
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
during
hot
weather
such
as
i
did
or
even
to
compliment
a
meal
i
recommend
this
one
and
hope
to
enjoy
many
more
of
these
to
come
this
is
simply
a
classic
americanbrewed
beer
that
is
true
to
its
style
thankfully
it
enjoys
a
wide
distribution
and
is
a
worthy
companion
in
your
glass
any
time
of
day
any
time
of
year
this
beer
should
be
served
on
the
warm
side
and
preferably
in
a
pilsner
will
try
again
o
wow
just
really
really
impressed
with
this
beer
my
first
journey
in
the
rogue
line
of
brews
it
came
highly
recommended
and
i
can
see
why
theyve
done
a
great
job
here
and
ive
love
to
try
it
on
tap
poured
a
nice
golden
red
with
a
very
small
amount
of
lacing
and
little
head
other
than
a
small
white
ring
smells
of
honey
molasses
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
great
it
leads
with
a
little
sweetness
then
goes
into
full
blown
malty
goodness
with
a
touch
of
honey
overall
i
wont
hesitate
to
purchase
this
again
only
problem
is
i
have
a
hard
time
taking
my
time
with
such
a
tasty
beer
doa
o
the
sweetnes
really
works
well
in
this
beer
a
great
mix
of
caramel
and
honey
blends
well
with
the
piney
hops
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
pale
ales
so
bare
with
me
here
the
taste
just
was
bland
for
me
too
bitter
and
spicy
i
thought
the
color
was
good
looking
and
the
smell
was
awesome
but
the
taste
really
made
me
sad
i
wanted
to
really
like
this
beerit
was
really
expensive
i
have
heard
good
things
about
rogue
but
maybe
i
should
stick
to
their
stouts
and
porters
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
d
a
bold
beer
to
make
this
beer
takes
balls
and
kudos
to
rogue
for
crafting
it
this
is
a
beer
that
tastes
like
its
in
love
with
itself
o
id
had
this
ontap
at
the
brewery
but
hadnt
reviewed
it
then
so
it
is
nice
to
revisit
this
brew
its
like
you
mixed
a
maibock
and
an
ipa
5050
i
dig
it
but
knocked
off
12
point
in
taste
for
the
mineralmetallic
flavor
o
this
one
was
a
pretty
decent
offering
from
rogue
it
wasnt
the
best
maibock
around
but
still
quite
enjoyable
ive
got
to
mark
it
down
a
little
for
the
oxidation
but
may
revisit
this
at
some
point
and
see
if
what
just
a
batch
or
line
issue
nothing
special
about
this
beer
except
the
name
o
dead
guy
ale
is
a
crisp
refreshing
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
from
rogues
by
any
means
but
a
nice
staple
for
them
interesting
brew
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
though
there
are
better
rogue
beers
out
there
m
medium
body
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
2
inch
white
head
and
good
retention
leaves
a
spider
web
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
light
sweetness
and
finishes
a
bit
with
of
citrus
and
tart
finish
medium
bodied
and
good
drinkability
a
clear
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
rocky
light
tan
colored
head
smells
of
freshly
baked
bread
the
taste
is
a
super
sweet
caramel
and
grain
medley
up
front
followed
by
some
zesty
light
balancing
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
conundrum
to
fit
in
stylistically
yet
that
matters
not
when
the
result
is
this
good
overall
i
wish
the
hops
were
a
little
brighter
to
really
counter
the
toastiness
i
get
i
had
trouble
picking
out
flavors
i
dont
really
get
any
of
the
fruity
notes
some
people
put
forth
unless
its
interfering
with
the
hop
or
is
the
hop
its
good
on
the
whole
but
after
having
rogues
hazelnut
brown
nectar
and
shakespeare
stout
i
had
much
higher
expectations
for
the
flavor
still
a
solid
beer
from
rogue
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
overall
a
great
brew
from
rogue
great
flavors
somewhat
complex
and
easily
drinkable
im
a
huge
rogue
ales
fan
and
part
of
rogue
nation
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
great
taste
all
around
if
its
on
tap
im
getting
it
my
reviews
arent
the
usual
but
i
tell
it
how
i
feel
great
beer
if
you
haven
tried
it
you
are
missing
out
cheers
overall
its
a
fairly
sweet
tasting
ale
impressive
considering
its
only
6
50
abv
with
its
great
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
checking
this
out
overall
good
brew
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
this
style
of
beer
is
my
favorite
o
wonderful
beer
but
i
should
have
known
that
all
my
friends
who
have
similar
taste
to
me
love
it
and
all
the
ones
with
polar
opposite
taste
hate
it
drinks
really
well
and
is
the
best
lager
i
have
had
normally
not
a
fan
of
lagers
thick
smooth
a
little
sweet
a
little
bitter
and
has
a
long
lasting
flavor
wicked
good
rjt
o
this
is
a
very
good
brew
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
around
and
review
it
this
is
sure
to
please
everybody
o
very
complex
and
enjoyable
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
path
into
a
different
kind
of
beer
for
me
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
dead
guy
ale
the
bottle
says
nothing
the
bottle
doesnt
say
anything
at
all
good
solid
beer
i
can
really
see
why
this
got
me
hooked
in
the
first
place
i
actually
remember
my
first
sips
this
beer
being
too
intense
as
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
its
amazing
how
things
change
overall
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
but
once
in
while
make
a
nice
change
from
ipas
pours
a
orangy
copper
with
a
slight
head
smells
a
little
bready
and
citric
generally
sweet
paired
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
flavor
is
some
caramel
malt
some
lemon
maybe
a
little
spice
of
some
kind
and
it
can
also
be
a
little
watered
down
at
times
moutfeel
is
thinner
i
can
be
hit
or
miss
with
this
one
sometimes
it
hits
me
just
right
and
i
dig
it
other
times
i
find
it
lacking
like
its
holding
back
on
me
and
not
giving
me
all
the
flavor
it
should
o
fantastic
beer
overall
im
definitely
going
to
go
back
to
the
mlcc
and
pick
up
some
more
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
have
not
had
anything
like
it
before
and
that
is
commendable
o
really
enjoyed
this
brew
unique
taste
compared
to
any
beer
or
ale
i
have
ever
drank
will
definitely
have
it
again
o
a
very
solid
beer
its
not
my
favorite
the
sweetness
really
took
my
by
surprise
on
my
first
sip
but
i
was
able
to
really
enjoy
it
once
i
got
past
the
initial
shock
its
just
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
o
this
beer
is
nostalgic
for
me
so
maybe
the
score
got
bumped
up
a
little
but
tasty
and
unique
flavor
i
havent
had
this
one
since
the
very
beginning
of
my
craft
beer
journey
lets
see
how
it
holds
up
it
is
a
rather
attractive
beer
with
a
hazy
redorange
body
and
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
the
taste
consists
of
sweet
malts
and
honey
primarily
with
a
touch
of
graininess
behind
it
theres
a
bit
of
a
fruit
aspect
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
coating
and
the
drinkability
is
alright
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
a
good
gateway
beer
for
sure
it
was
for
me
nice
syrupy
body
o
decent
wouldnt
seek
out
again
though
middle
of
the
road
try
for
your
self
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
2
or
3
in
an
evening
but
very
solid
and
a
well
done
maibock
i
actually
preferred
on
tap
to
the
12oz
bottle
the
bottle
had
a
bit
more
bite
where
the
tap
was
a
little
more
balanced
which
had
me
finishing
and
ordering
another
in
no
time
overall
maybe
im
a
bit
biased
when
it
comes
to
dead
guy
and
if
so
its
only
because
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
liking
beer
again
and
started
me
onto
the
journey
i
find
myself
on
today
a
good
45
times
a
year
i
find
myself
saying
you
know
what
tonights
a
dead
guy
night

was

okay
i
got
it
as
a
christmas
gift
and
was
excited
to
see
it
was
a
maibock
as
i
like
that
style
and
usually
dont
buy
that
style
until
the
spring
although
i
didnt
like
it
as
much

it

as
though
the

has
to
mark
most
bottles
from

s
with
a

a

its
been
the
case
with

anyways
this

i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
lot
more
comlex
but
its
more
of
a
simple
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
could
have
a
few
before
i
would
look
for
something
a

this
beer
had
a
very
sweet
smell
when
i
popped
the
bottle
it
has
a
hazy
red
color
a
nice
head
after
the
pour
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
fruitybut
yet
malty
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
all
time
favourite
brew
plus
i
dig
the
label
on
the
bottle
reminds
me
of
a
beer
that
deadheads
would
like
i
cant
wait
to
try
other
brews
by
rogue
of
this
great
region
of
our
country
life
is
shortlive
free
and
alwaysalways
drink
great
beer
if
you
can
d
very
drinkable
and
tasty
great
warmer
weather
beer
with
a
nice
malt
profile
and
perfect
hop
balance
d
definitely
drinkable
the
price
makes
it
a
bit
out
of
reach
in
my
market
but
as
a
tall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
yet
strong
ale
which
i
have
come
back
to
this
beer
is
slightly
syrupy
but
the
long
finish
helps
this
beer
glide
right
down
your
throat
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
prefers
lightly
hopped
ales
this
beer
is
served
a
hazy
red
body
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
extraordinarily
bready
there
is
a
bread
yeast
aroma
that
is
superbly
potent
the
taste
however
is
surprisingly
awkward
while
there
are
minor
biscuit
and
malt
flavors
the
main
body
is
rather
fruity
to
my
palate
there
is
almost
a
raspberry
apple
flavor
that
is
strong
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
really
quite
watery
but
for
a
lighter
bock
its
not
too
bad
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
isnt
all
that
great
the
flavor
combinations
build
to
a
point
where
the
beer
is
really
not
too
great
to
drink
i
blame
the
strong
fruit
flavors
not
that
great
of
a
beer
overall
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
though
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
pack
for
me
this
is
truly
gold
in
a
glass
the
cpj
d
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
again
but
considering
the
oily
thickness
and
overall
sweetness
i
dont
think
i
could
have
too
many
in
a
night
overall
a
delicious
beer
that
i
would
recommend
surprisingly
enough
i
really
really
enjoy
the
double
dead
guy
but
not
so
much
the
regular
dead
guy
d
im
a
little
puzzled
by
this
one
as
it
seemed
a
little
off
dead
guy
is
one
of
my
old
favorites
but
i
wasnt
feeling
this
one
it
also
had
the
disadvantage
of
following
a
cbc
creeper
but
measures
were
taken
to
cleanse
the
palatte
drinkability
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
this
brew
and
i
am
very
pleased
a
nice
balance
not
too
hoppy
not
too
malty
and
a
nice
alcohol
kick
that
lets
you
know
it
means
business
very
well
balanced
indeed
would
purchase
again
this
is
by
far
my
most
favorite
beer
to
drink
on
any
occasion
the
price
can
be
a
little
steep
but
have
a
growler
i
can
refill
that
makes
it
reasonable
it
is
not
available
at
enough
places
i
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
this
beer
on
draught
has
no
competition
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
sturdy
beer
lover
dlove
this
beer
from
rogue
this
could
be
a
great
spring
summer
beer
even
though
i
enjoyed
mine
in
the
winter
its
a
beer
you
can
get
23
of
in
a
night
and
be
very
satisfied
dif
you
are
a
bock
fan
this
is
a
good
choice
very
drinkable
beer
more
than
a
sipper
cheers
recommended
i
havent
been
this
surprised
by
a
beer
in
a
long
time
absolutely
delicious
and
i
just
looked
up
there
at
the
top
of
this
page
and
see
that
its
6

abv
holy
crap
i
wouldve
guessed
4
a
deliciously
balanced
beer
with
high
drinkability
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
sweet
notes
are
not
overpowering
definitely
a
beer
i
will
come
back
to
ive
added
this
to
my
long
list
of
favorites
from
rogue
notes
in
my
opinion
this
a
very
well
made
and
wonderfully
balanced
maibock
dead
on
for
the
style
overall
definitely
disappointed
with
this
rogue
xs
imperial
red
is
a
better
bet
one
of
my
favorites
from
rouge
slightly
darker
copper
appreance
nice
strong
stench
that
fills
your
nostrils
it
has
a
very
unique
strong
taste
at
first
but
leaves
a
nice
smooth
after
taste
i
have
never
had
it
on
tap
but
bottled
is
just
as
good
i
assume
highly
suggested
if
you
have
not
tried
and
are
a
big
bock
fan
drinkability
this
once
again
is
a
solid
well
rounded
effort
from
rogue
they
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
this
brew
is
easily
drinkable
would
work
well
at
any
point
during
the
year
it
is
considerably
sweet
so
that
may
deter
some
but
it
would
still
be
enjoyable
for
me
through
several
rounds
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
had
ontap
in
growler
and
in
bottle
lived
in
oregon
for
awhile
so
i
frequented
the
brewery
whenever
i
had
the
chance
will
always
be
one
of
the
better
rogue
offerings
in
my
opinion
perfectly
wellbalanced
hops
and
malt
with
a
smooth
coppery
finish
reddishbrown
in
color
and
not
hazy
with
a
relatively
strong
abv
highly
recommended
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
makes
this
delicious
and
drinkable
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
often
gets
overlooked
due
to
the
bashing
of
rogue
when
its
reasonably
priced
it
is
well
worth
drinking
drinkability
its
okay
a
touch
less
taste
than
i
rememberedexpected
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
personally
however
id
be
reluctant
to
put
up
5
for
a
deucedeuce
of
the
sweet
juice
known
as
dead
guy
ale
overall
i
was
pretty
upset
with
this
purchase
i
was
expecting
more
drinkability
the
dead
guy
is
very
tasty
id
have
another
if
i
had
one
here
definitely
a
beer
to
try
more
than
once
first
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
edgewater
tavern
in
chicago
it
was
something
of
an
enigma
then
and
its
something
of
an
enigma
now
not
that
theres
anything
fundamentally
wrong
with
that
drinkability
is
quite
good
with
a
wellbalanced
flavor
profile
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
a
relatively
light
abv
dead
guy
ale
is
very
drinkable
rogue
has
let
me
down
before
with
their
line
of
oddball
beers
but
im
liking
this
brew
wouldnt
mind
knocking
back
a
couple
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
a
good
sessions
beer
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
nothing
terribly
innovative
or
particularly
interesting
but
its
a
great
goto
when
you
are
looking
for
a
simple
balanced
wellcrafted
ale
drink
very
nice
session
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
up
there
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
would
definitely
enjoy
another
got
in
a
64oz
1
gallon
glass
jug
poured
into
glass
stein
the
appearence
is
almost
an
apple
cider
look
with
a
fast
fading
head
very
pleasurable
aroma
with
hits
of
citrus
and
hoppiness
mellow
and
smooth
to
taste
with
a
faint
aftertaste
fading
to
a
dry
ending
very
drinkable
beer
as
an
american
ale
would
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
looking
forward
to
the
double
dead
guy
ale
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
1
pillowy
white
head
that
fades
pretty
fast
and
leaves
a
sticky
web
of
lace
all
the
way
smells
bready
and
sweet
with
hints
of
apple
and
white
grape
juice
and
vanilla
tastes
of
real
sweet
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
nutty
yeasty
bready
mild
bitterness
had
a
stucky
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
highly
drinkable
in
my
book
cheers
drinkability
this
beer
is
to
be
sipped
for
sure
im
gonna
drink
this
very
slowly
slight
tastes
of
candied
malts
with
a
raisin
bitterness
taste
on
the
finish
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
or
on
tap
cloudy
orange
pour
with
a
huge
foamy
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
it
reminds
me
of
an
dipa
that
has
sat
around
awhile
and
had
its
hoppy
profile
start
shifting
to
a
more
malty
balance
flavor
is
malty
with
some
citrusfruity
notes
to
it
finish
is
a
clean
and
slightly
hoppy
feeling
on
your
tongue
i
love
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
overall
ok
but
would
not
actively
seek
this
out
ill
finish
the
sixer
but
unless
i
detect
a
huge
difference
in
the
flavor
ill
likely
not
return
very
dry
and
bitter
on
the
end
with
no
lingering
flavor
no
delicious
hoppiness
just
bitter
no
real
complexity
or
depth
here
pours
a
nice
one
finger
head
looks
like
an
ipa
to
me
very
orange
and
hazy
not
hazy
like
a
belgian
wheat
though
looks
decent
head
is
fading
quickly
though
smells
hoppy
in
the
front
end
with
a
slight
malt
note
in
the
back
end
maybe
a
slight
fruit
or
citrus
note
hidden
in
there
somewhere
too
wow
taste
is
very
smooth
probably
the
smoothest
hoppy
beer
i
have
ever
had
granted
its
not
as
hoppy
as
some
beers
but
still
pretty
simple
beer
all
together
though
at
first
you
just
get
that
smooth
feel
and
then
come
the
hops
and
malts
if
there
is
any
fruit
or
citrus
it
is
almost
undetectable
in
the
taste
pretty
good
beer
all
together
nothing
outstanding
but
pretty
good
colby
d
i
found
this
drank
fairly
easily
its
just
about
standard
abv
with
a
light
body
and
nothing
overpowering
i
do
think
a
little
more
carbonation
would
help
make
it
more
crisp
and
drinkable
cloudyhazy
burnt
tangerine
with
a
decent
1
5
white
head
diminished
to
a
thick
ring
with
spotty
lace
prominent
whiff
of
alcohol
and
very
little
else
to
back
it
up
hint
of
citrus
and
grass
maybe
some
cereal
grains
in
there
somewhere
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
with
a
healthy
blend
of
honey
and
caramel
followed
by
delicate
touch
of
grapefruit
herbal
and
grassy
finish
theres
a
huge
turnoff
here
why
is
my
bottle
of
dead
guy
metallic
tasting
metallic
finish
kind
of
kills
the
4
0
i
was
gonna
give
it
hearty
and
almost
meaty
texture
nicely
carbonated
and
quite
smooth
almost
thick
to
the
point
where
it
coats
the
palate
but
actually
gives
a
very
balanced
body
between
sweet
and
dry
was
going
to
give
better
drinkability
but
this
metallic
flavor
is
getting
on
my
nerves
along
with
the
crazy
alcoholic
nose
gah
d
quite
drinkable
i
thought
only
deterrent
is
the
aforementioned
sweetness
that
has
a
tendency
to
override
the
palatecleansing
hop
flavors
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
decent
abv
and
well
balanced
flavor
that
i
will
buy
again
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
pretty
great
a
little
think
on
the
mouth
feel
but
a
great
drinkability
my
first
from
rogue
but
not
my
last
a
good
choice
d
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
enjoyed
very
much
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
as
i
said
in
the
taste
it
reminds
me
of
a
mild
fat
tire
it
has
plenty
of
spices
and
flavor
without
overwhelming
the
natural
malt
and
hops
di
honestly
have
never
heard
of
a
mailbock
but
id
be
certainly
willing
to
try
another
if
this
beer
is
a
standard
example
of
one
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
great
for
all
points
in
the
day
good
stuff
can
always
have
more
than
a
few
overall
an
excellent
beer
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
overall
a
really
good
maibock
id
have
this
years
ago
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beers
and
hated
it
glad
i
tried
it
again
as
i
liked
it
much
much
better
this
time
around
recommend
especially
if
you
want
to
try
the
style
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
while
it
was
good
im
in
a
long
term
hop
phase
so
dont
see
being
a
6
pack
or
bomber
but
maybe
the
occasional
single
or
tap
oo
d
possibly
sessionable
at
6
5
abv
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
out
of
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
m
very
little
carination
and
a
medium
body
make
this
an
enjoyable
beer
different
in
body
then
many
maibock
beers
i
believe
this
beer
to
be
more
flavorful
then
a
typical
maibock
i
like
this
beer
but
would
like
it
to
be
more
biter
i
find
this
to
be
a
highly
drinkable
and
respectable
beer
i
also
like
that
it
is
easy
to
find
even
at
bars
that
are
not
full
blown
beer
bars
notes
my
first
maibock
interestingly
called
an
ale
yet
classed
under
a
german
lager
i
like
it
a
lot
but
it
does
have
a
rather
hefty
price
tag
on
this
side
of
the
states
side
note
cap
had
some
kind
of
plastic
insert
that
would
keep
beer
from
touching
metal
cap
and
also
better
seal
beer
for
carbonation
was
very
impressed
with
this
feature
this
is
a
classic
craft
beer
the
definition
of
a
flagship
brew
imo
everyone
whos
everyone
thats
into
the
craft
scene
must
try
this
at
least
once
i
get
this
on
tap
every
time
i
go
to
my
local
pub
it
is
a
great
beer
the
aroma
is
all
malt
with
a
slight
amount
of
hops
in
the
background
it
is
a
very
tasty
brew
whether
it
is
hot
or
cold
out
very
smooth
but
full
feeling
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
is
one
that
i
will
drink
again
not
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
though
this
drinks
very
well
for
the
amount
of
grains
you
are
getting
i
usually
grab
a
couple
of
these
on
tap
at
this
local
english
style
pub
drinkabilityreally
good
ale
could
probably
do
this
one
all
day
the
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
malts
and
finishes
with
small
hop
bite
that
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
a
very
good
beer
definitely
a
beer
that
will
be
looked
for
again
moreys
bottom
line
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
representation
i
dont
ever
buy
this
beer
but
this
was
a
gift
and
one
that
i
was
happy
to
receive
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
copper
body
with
1
finger
of
white
head
decent
retention
some
light
lacing
the
aromas
are
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
malts
and
citrus
hops
i
get
a
nice
citrus
piney
taste
coming
through
initially
but
its
not
overpowering
and
quickly
balances
out
with
some
fruity
caramel
malt
flavors
also
picking
up
some
pepperlike
spices
throughout
consumption
and
it
has
a
nice
somewhat
bitter
finish
which
i
really
enjoy
medium
bodied
proper
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
d
good
drinkability
rich
malts
are
not
quite
my
thing
so
i
cant
put
back
too
many
but
it
is
overall
very
clean
and
an
enjoyable
nonoffensive
brew
d
nice
well
rounded
beer
would
drink
again
to
me
this
is
an
american
ale
of
a
high
standard
deep
golden
copper
with
a
trace
of
head
and
lots
of
thin
lacing
low
carbonation
full
of
flavour
the
sweet
notes
of
candied
sugar
not
sure
if
this
is
just
the
malt
though
pleasing
tart
hoppiness
without
too
much
astringency
or
excessive
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
thats
not
too
sticky
nor
too
bland
and
very
drinkable
aromas
arent
too
strong
and
this
is
out
of
an
almostsnifter
because
of
the
low
head
retention
and
carbonation
but
thats
ok
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
an
attractive
appearance
pleasing
taste
and
cool
bottle
artwork
that
i
will
gladly
drink
again
any
time
i
get
the
chance
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
bock
of
any
description
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangeamber
color
an
offwhite
head
recedes
but
sticks
to
the
glass
smell
is
rich
smoky
slightly
sweet
malts
very
nice
taste
starts
and
ends
bitter
with
the
middle
part
being
those
pungent
malts
very
good
balance
beer
drinks
smoothly
has
enough
alcohol
to
feel
it
and
is
easy
to
drink
a
quaffable
one
this
is
very
nice
strong
hoppy
notes
balanced
by
a
smooth
malty
flavor
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
soft
foamy
head
finishes
a
little
harsh
for
my
liking
and
lingers
with
you
for
a
while
this
is
definitely
rouge
brewerys
flagship
beer
for
something
a
little
more
exciting
and
unique
try
one
of
their
other
22oz
specialty
beers
drinkability
easy
on
the
taste
buds
and
a
little
complex
makes
a
great
fall
beer
drinkability
smooth
and
sweet
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
d
pretty
drinkable
the
big
presence
of
bready
malt
seems
to
get
a
little
heavy
by
the
end
of
the
glass
but
overall
it
is
solid
a
good
beer
but
overpriced
and
way
overhyped
d
great
as
mentioned
above
this
brew
ability
to
be
many
things
at
once
makes
this
very
drinkable
year
round
drinkability
goes
down
great
i
could
pretty
easily
polish
of
a
6
pack
of
these
in
a
night
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
medium
body
higher
carbonation
and
some
dry
feel
drinks
pretty
well
but
a
fairly
forgettable
beer
to
be
honest
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
smell
is
of
caramel
or
a
sweet
munich
malt
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
is
spicy
with
hints
of
being
noble
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
i
would
consider
this
drinkable
and
well
balanced
i
can
say
i
appreicate
not
nose
of
this
one
gladly
not
having
any
excessive
corn
cereal
to
it
looks
like
a
flatter
pale
feels
like
one
too
with
the
distinct
lace
of
syrup
that
gives
it
a
bit
of
warmth
and
sweetness
moreso
than
just
a
pale
can
feel
the
higher
abv
in
the
slight
bitter
heat
its
above
average
in
taste
but
still
doesnt
have
a
distinct
bitter
munich
rich
straw
that
i
would
like
to
feel
very
mine
pine
and
sarsaparilla
bitter
with
a
tad
of
protein
not
bad
had
better
americans
though
i
could
drink
this
all
night
smooth
crisp
light
in
the
body
feels
nice
going
down
i
wish
i
got
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
this
is
everything
i
would
want
an
ale
to
taste
and
feel
like
very
close
to
being
perfect
deschutes
if
the
best
local
beer
available
in
all
the
supermarkets
d
a
nice
hop
character
with
a
great
malt
backbone
and
the
sweetness
brings
it
all
together
very
tasty
and
sessionable
i
had
the
650ml
6
5
bottle
the
appearance
was
good
a
nice
amber
color
the
smell
wasnt
all
it
should
be
but
average
the
taste
above
average
in
fact
very
good
but
no
top
shelf
kind
of
beer
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
great
smooth
with
just
the
right
hint
of
hops
and
drinkability
was
exceptional
went
down
great
and
no
real
lasting
aftertaste
but
the
hops
which
i
loved
d
awesome
i
could
drink
many
of
these
and
will
definitely
buy
it
again
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
nose
is
malty
caramel
yeast
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
malts
earthy
floral
hops
with
some
bready
notes
palate
is
full
body
good
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malts
balanced
very
well
with
earthy
bitter
hops
a
very
nice
smooth
and
flavorful
brew
drinks
fairly
light
and
refreshing
certainly
this
is
rogues
most
popular
beer
though
i
dont
feel
its
their
best
on
tap
at
bjs
dont
remember
which
one
in
ca
hazy
dark
amber
hue
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
and
caramel
malt
hoppy
citrusy
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
full
tangy
body
i
would
not
guess
it
is
a
maibock
it
tastes
more
like
american
ipa
to
me
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
head
is
just
over
an
inch
tall
in
my
coke
glass
and
has
great
retention
as
is
slowly
recedes
it
leaves
fun
traces
of
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
with
slight
hop
smell
the
taste
really
blew
me
away
i
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
it
is
malty
with
just
enough
hop
to
back
it
up
the
balance
is
perfect
to
me
the
taste
is
clean
and
finishes
well
you
always
want
another
drink
anyways
the
most
prominent
taste
is
a
sweet
malt
followed
by
some
earthy
hops
has
a
nice
smooth
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
only
downside
is
high
abv
and
high
price
which
make
it
not
so
sessionable
not
that
i
wouldnt
like
to
try
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
well
balanced
just
the
right
body
for
spring
and
fall
awful
pretty
and
delicious
to
boot
this
seems
quite
drinkable
although
it
may
be
a
touch
sweet
d
rich
and
complex
very
drinkable
drinkability
good
but
not
great
may
be
a
little
too
rich
for
its
own
good
it
doesnt
leave
a
yearning
to
have
more
tastes
malty
earthy
some
pine
hops
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
arrogant
bastard
dry
finish
the
abv
is
noticeable
overall
pretty
drinkable
with
many
kinds
of
food
pairings
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
not
sure
what
a
maibock
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
this
is
a
good
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
year
around
it
reminded
me
of
wine
but
not
for
all
of
the
bad
reasons
i
narrowed
down
that
nomad
thought
togrape
taste
it
had
all
of
the
accompanying
beer
pleasures
hops
carbonation
general
sense
of
being
awesome
etc
d
could
have
these
for
a
session
also
feel
as
though
this
would
pair
well
with
just
about
anything
given
the
mood
really
would
pick
this
up
whenever
i
needed
a
go
to
beer
flavor
wise
the
hops
have
been
masked
a
little
bit
but
are
still
definitely
prevalent
in
the
flavor
but
are
not
overpowering
in
combination
with
the
malted
flavors
there
is
a
little
bit
of
citrusy
sweetness
at
the
end
and
it
leaves
a
pretty
dry
taste
in
your
mouth
it
has
a
nice
thickness
not
too
much
carbonation
easy
to
down
d
above
average
beer
brewer
built
this
beer
with
a
clean
crisp
taste
in
mind
fruit
flavors
are
overwhelming
and
welcomed
with
every
sip
overall
good
beer
and
something
i
would
drink
a
few
of
every
once
in
a
while
d
very
good
maibock
but
might
be
a
little
too
bitter
for
large
consumption
i
would
still
recommend
it
d
good
drinkability
i
would
definately
have
more
of
this
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
more
than
a
little
surprised
that
i
liked
this
ale
so
much
but
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
rogue
brews
good
stuff
overall
a
good
beer
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
granite
brewerys
peculiar
not
necessarily
in
taste
but
in
that
its
hard
to
exactly
peg
or
pigeonhole
it
d
its
a
decent
drinker
maybe
a
bit
more
maltcentric
and
sweeter
than
some
of
my
maibock
favorites
something
that
would
pair
well
with
pizza
the
growler
is
a
bit
gimmicky
and
a
touch
overpriced
even
the
bomber
and
sixer
prices
are
a
touch
high
in
my
opinion
this
was
really
tough
to
rate
i
dont
think
its
a
traditional
maibock
yet
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
keep
finding
myself
wanted
to
up
or
down
each
category
by
about
12
point
drinkability
is
not
so
good
the
one
pint
was
all
i
could
handle
at
the
old
chicago
if
its
going
to
have
a
bitter
dominance
id
prefer
citruspinegrass
over
aspirin
any
day
this
beer
is
very
nice
to
look
at
theres
about
2
fingers
of
head
on
top
of
an
amber
clear
beer
there
is
nice
lacing
as
well
the
smell
is
a
little
weak
with
some
sweetness
and
floral
hops
but
really
not
much
the
taste
has
a
more
prominent
hop
presence
and
is
a
bit
light
and
fruity
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
good
carbonation
this
light
tasting
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
good
to
have
a
few
of
in
a
night
pours
a
moderate
caramelbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
light
floral
hops
over
a
body
of
caramel
and
some
lightlysweet
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
bready
with
some
yeast
characteristics
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
that
i
had
but
not
something
that
impresses
me
terribly
these
days
one
of
my
favorites
would
love
to
find
it
on
tap
around
me
all
in
all
this
beer
tastes
like
iced
tea
it
has
the
look
on
iced
tea
too
if
you
like
the
tea
flavor
then
this
beer
is
for
you
i
do
love
tea
so
this
one
is
good
for
me
good
to
try
once
for
the
style
o
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
the
aroma
made
me
laugh
so
it
was
worth
the
ride
d
very
enjoyable
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
nice
hop
kick
to
it
is
somthing
i
didnt
expect
coming
into
it
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
rogue
is
a
great
brewery
and
the
beers
i
have
had
from
them
have
all
been
great
next
time
i
hit
the
old
beer
store
i
am
going
to
get
a
couple
of
their
brews
i
have
yet
to
try
must
say
dead
guy
ale
is
a
great
brew
and
is
a
must
try
i
forsee
i
will
be
drinking
this
many
times
again
in
the
future
cheers
d
could
drink
this
all
night
great
session
beer
or
anytime
beer
honestly
this
is
my
new
goto
beer
for
expanding
friends
beer
horizons
d
i
love
this
beer
this
is
the
fist
time
i
have
tried
it
i
will
keep
this
beer
in
my
mind
when
im
looking
for
beer
that
iv
already
tried
and
like
im
glad
i
got
the
last
bottle
at
the
store
dead
guy
ale
has
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
colour
the
head
lasted
less
than
a
minute
but
it
maintained
some
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
warm
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
hoppy
high
notes
the
maltiness
intensifies
as
you
swallow
until
some
bitterness
can
be
tasted
this
beer
feels
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
due
to
the
decent
amount
of
carbonation
d
nice
and
drinkable
definitely
a
goto
if
theres
nothing
else
available
lack
of
character
and
onedimensionality
of
this
beer
precludes
me
from
drinking
it
often
but
at
times
especially
when
its
available
fresh
in
a
growler
ill
get
it
and
enjoy
while
the
growler
lasts
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
thin
white
head
great
sweet
nutty
flavor
with
a
dry
hop
finish
balanced
medium
body
makes
you
want
to
drink
several
and
i
have
not
a
must
have
from
rogue
but
it
is
a
great
go
to
brew
thanks
rogue
d
could
have
this
all
night
excellent
offering
moderate
abv
this
would
make
a
good
spring
time
beer
fyi
amazing
good
would
and
could
have
it
at
any
point
any
where
beer
isnt
to
heavy
nor
light
its
great
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
and
great
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
malts
vanilla
and
some
dark
fruit
tastes
of
vanilla
chocolate
coffee
notes
roasted
flavor
and
some
hidden
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
drinkability
is
above
average
drinkability
i
am
fairly
impressed
with
this
beer
very
nice
tasting
beer
that
offers
a
lot
to
the
senses
overall
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
a
nite
but
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pass
out
at
a
party
d
nicely
drinkable
nothing
about
it
makes
me
not
want
to
take
another
drink
overall
this
will
be
gone
relatively
quick
could
be
a
session
beer
though
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
at
one
time
ive
had
this
before
in
the
past
and
dont
remember
it
being
as
blanddull
so
maybe
ill
revisit
it
in
the
future
especially
for
the
price
for
a
bottle
had
more
expectations
listed
as
a
maibock
helles
always
thought
of
it
as
an
apa
would
like
to
find
it
on
tap
sometime
i
had
no
problem
pounding
this
pint
and
a
half
extremely
drinkable
in
conclusion
this
beer
was
ok
im
not
a
fan
of
bock
beers
so
this
was
an
experiment
for
me
frankly
im
still
not
a
fan
of
them
overall
it
tastes
like
a
bock
beer
and
is
probably
a
good
beer
for
those
who
like
the
style
d
decent
session
beer
gets
better
with
more
sips
a
safe
pick
at
the
bar
a
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
and
a
light
beige
color
retention
is
good
and
coats
the
interior
of
the
glass
medium
orange
to
dark
gold
in
color
crystal
clear
beer
which
permits
great
visibility
to
all
the
activity
going
on
in
this
beer
4
25
s
the
nose
is
quite
heavy
on
the
malts
and
has
a
lightly
toasted
and
malted
milk
ball
aroma
i
also
perceive
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
on
the
nose
no
hops
are
really
perceived
4
00
t
the
hops
that
alluded
me
on
the
nose

is

then
i
got
busy
doing
a
few
things
as
the
beer
settled
in
the
glass
upon
my
next
sip
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
pleasant
and
balanced
the
flavor
was
i
started
to
wonder
if
this
was
intended
to
be
a
red
ale
theres
no
prevalent
sign
of
hoppiness
or
nuttiness
just
a
coppercolored
ale
that
tastes
great
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
brewery
drinkability
is
good
and
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
due
to
its
availability
d
well
balanced
but
you
gotta
like
hops
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
good
but
not
great
picked
up
a
prepackaged
growler
of
this
from
the
liquour
store
for
a
party
and
on
a
separate
night
had
a
couple
bottles
at
a
thai
restaurant
for
dinner
i
will
review
the
growler
as
it
seemed
a
little
perkier
and
more
flavorful
dark
garnet
color
small
offwhite
head
lightly
hopped
good
caramel
flavors
sweet
but
not
cloying
so
a
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
beer
drinks
rather
well
skirts
many
styles
and
falls
in
between
them
all
in
search
of
balance
finds
balance
and
sticks
in
the
middle
of
the
road
safe
seems
like
i
have
tasted
a
bunch
of
this
over
the
last
year
a
nice
option
to
add
to
any
repertoire
since
it
seems
to
be
readily
available
i
ended
moving
this
to
a
tulip
which
helped
coax
out
the
malty
aromas
along
with
malts
i
got
toffee
and
something
like
bread
pudding
this
did
need
to
warm
up
a
bit
for
the
aromas
to
come
alive
the
malty
flavors
are
quickly
matched
by
the
hops
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
very
solid
and
balance
beer
one
i
will
grab
whenever
it
is
on
sale
d
extremely
wellbalanced
beer
alcohol
level
is
appropriate
great
session
beer
final
notes
definitely
more
of
a
session
beer
and
i
must
say
its
kind
of
nice
rogue
makes
one
that
said
it
lacked
the
interest
and
offthewall
characteristics
ive
come
to
expect
from
rogue
and
as
such
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
still
a
great
beer
though
d
very
drinkable
no
overpowering
flavors
not
too
high
in
alcohol
and
alcohol
flavors
a
hidden
d
this
is
a
personal
favorite
i
find
it
extremely
drinkable
due
to
its
balance
i
like
to
use
this
beer
as
a
gateway
to
introducing
friends
to
rogue
this
is
a
great
beer
and
for
me
i
often
find
myself
comparing
other
ales
to
this
one
for
personal
comparison
and
ranking
enjoy
its
time
for
me
to
go
open
another
one
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
d
well
im
a
rogue
fan
but
rarely
buy
any
of
their
beer
for
some
reason
that
i
really
cant
explain
this
bottle
was
gifted
to
me
as
a
souvenir
from
a
trip
to
yellowstone
glad
it
was
i
havent
sampled
this
one
in
a
really
long
time
it
was
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
going
on
craft
beer
many
years
ago
over
the
years
my
pallette
has
changed
and
i
prefer
hoppier
beers
but
this
one
still
hits
the
spot
for
me
the
malty
flavors
and
body
that
is
achieved
is
quite
good
and
the
hops
play
off
of
this
just
about
perfectly
never
taking
over
and
only
serving
to
help
show
off
the
finer
points
of
the
malt
this
is
really
smooth
and
im
figuring
this
would
go
really
well
with
something
off
the
grill
never
thought
of
this
as
a
maibock
before
now
but
surprising
to
me
this
hits
the
style
pretty
well
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
if
someone
handed
me
one
i
wouldnt
refuse
but
on
the
same
token
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
taste
is
nothing
special
its
sticky
sweet
up
front
and
almost
harshly
bitter
on
the
finish
not
too
much
flavour
complexity
either
mainly
just
sweet
malt
no
real
caramel
toast
hops
or
anything
else
just
greengrassy
malty
sweetness
finishing
with
a
neutral
hop
bitterness
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
d
i
could
have
34
of
these
no
problem
truly
interchangeable
in
that
i
could
enjoy
one
or
more
during
any
season
of
the
year
malty
and
substantial
enough
for
fall
or
winter
yet
light
and
drinkable
enough
for
spring
or
summer
overall
a
very
good
beer
perhaps
not
unique
or
outstanding
but
worthwhile
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
flavorful
as
i
was
expecting
would
drink
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
still
more
complex
of
course
but
i
get
the
feeling
they
were
going
for
a
cheaper
beer
and
taste
shows
a
tad
watery
medium
hop
bitterness
thin
and
pale
mouthfeel
probably
a
mix
of
paleamberdark
malt
for
this
brew
easily
drinkable
but
this
is
not
a
complement
this
beer
could
easily
be
much
better
but
i
feel
like
its
integrity
was
compromised
somewhere
along
the
way
great
label
one
of
the
better
rogue
bottles
ive
seen
pours
a
cloudy
redapricot
color
on
the
verge
of
copper
with
a
medium
white
head
the
scent
is
malty
with
dark
fruits
and
a
fair
amount
of
hops
i
also
get
some
caramel
scents
the
taste
is
exactly
as
it
smells
on
first
taste
i
get
a
complex
blend
of
malt
dark
fruits
and
caramel
then
i
get
a
light
hint
of
hops
and
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
light
yet
full
of
flavor
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
overall
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
that
really
pops
out
from
the
crowd
the
light
coloration
and
the
boozy
flavor
dont
do
much
for
me
especially
at
only
6
5
abv
but
the
taste
is
satisfactory
for
something
called
dead
guy
and
if
you
want
to
man
up
and
down
a
jug
the
abv
is
just
right
yar
the
wellbalanced
nature
of
this
brew
adds
significantly
to
its
drinkability
which
i
believe
is
fairly
high
its
great
tasting
but
goes
down
easily
with
no
major
characteristics
standing
out
wise
drinkability
this
is
the
kind
of
craft
beer
that
i
wish
people
that
never
had
craft
beers
before
could
try
its
tasty
smooth
and
rich
you
can
drink
45
of
these
no
problem
or
you
could
session
this
with
a
friend
its
extremely
drinkable
tasty
with
smooth
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
even
though
its
6
6abv
i
would
still
consider
this
as
a
potential
session
beer
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
balanced
taste
which
struck
a
good
compromise
between
favouring
the
malt
flavour
but
still
adding
a
nice
edge
of
pronounced
hops
and
subtle
sweet
flavours
to
the
mix
overall
very
solid
beer
overall
although
im
not
sure
its
really
a
maibock
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
d
easy
to
drink
and
satiates
your
thirst
quite
well
would
probably
get
it
again
but
its
fairly
expensive
in
ontarios
lcbos
d
average
drinkability
with
no
distinguished
characteristics
would
take
a
pretty
bad
tap
list
for
me
to
revisit
d
absolutely
spot
on
this
was
quite
a
nice
beer
experience
pours
a
bright
amberorange
colour
with
slightly
offwhite
head
head
dissipates
without
much
lacing
smell
is
incredibly
fruity
and
lots
of
bready
malt
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
reminds
me
of
some
english
ales
actually
though
i
may
just
be
crazy
or
wrong
smooth
mouthfeel
but
a
little
bit
undercarbonated
this
is
pretty
expensive
in
ontario
so
i
dont
drink
it
often
even
though
it
is
available
but
i
would
drink
it
more
if
the
price
were
right
i
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
used
to
perhaps
my
tastes
have
changed
or
i
got
an
old
bottle
but
its
still
a
good
beer
that
i
will
not
have
a
problem
revisiting
in
the
future
simple
straightforward
uncomplicated
brew
but
very
pleasant
overall
due
to
the
famous
pacman
yeast
which
improves
as
it
nears
room
temperature
its
not
a
maibock
but
im
not
complaining
d
this
one
is
easily
drinkable
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
flavours
are
nicely
balanced
and
allaround
a
very
tasty
beer
highly
recommended
to
anyone
looking
a
nicely
balanced
hop
offering
the
mouthfeel
is
a
succulent
combination
of
creamy
smooth
malt
and
quenching
hop
carbonation
really
perfect
it
is
easy
to
enjoy
but
full
of
deep
and
wide
flavors
making
it
an
excellent
beer
for
dinner
spicy
foods
anything
off
the
grill
or
deep
tomato
based
pastas
dmakes
my
cheeks
warm
tasty
but
a
bit
low
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
thought
upon
ordering
a
draft
of
dead
guy
that
i
was
familiar
with
the
beer
i
was
very
pleasantly
taken
aback
by
the
distinctly
good
flavor
of
dead
guy
it
is
a
very
nice
amber
color
and
has
a
terrific
smell
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
with
a
blend
of
spice
i
dont
recall
appreciating
this
beer
as
much
out
of
a
bottle
thanks
to
the
folks
at
shebeen
in
charlottesville
va
for
keeping
in
on
tap
and
running
great
happy
hour
specials
light
smooth
and
pretty
tasty
not
bad
at
all
for
those
who
like
cheese
it
belongs
with
a
brie
double
creme
that
cheese
brings
the
nutty
taste
on
another
level
good
stuff
d
a
very
solid
maibock
lots
of
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
have
had
it
many
times
and
would
definitely
order
it
again
d
dead
guy
ale
is
a
great
brew
that
is
incredibly
drinkable
the
emphasis
of
the
honey
makes
the
brew
absolutely
fantastic
the
malt
is
pretty
extreme
in
it
drinkability
abv
is
significantly
higher
than
flavor
or
body
would
suggest
one
could
drink
this
in
session
but
beware
the
abv
overall
a
unique
and
americanized
interpretation
of
the
style
that
is
very
enjoyable
good
beer
to
take
the
edge
off
of
a
hot
day
at
work
prost
overall
this
tasted
much
better
from
the
bottle
than
it
did
ontap
nicely
nuanced
malt
flavors
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
make
this
one
worth
a
shot
d
easy
drinking
at
6
5
abv
definitely
one
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
have
alongside
a
nice
meal
d
absolutely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brews
ive
had
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
that
beer
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
makes
you
want
another
drinkability
is
stellar
could
of
stayed
there
and
pounded
all
afternoon
into
evening
picked
some
up
on
way
home
from
work
will
keep
revisitng
this
old
friend
with
more
frequency
i
believe
upon
pouring
this
beer
a
beautiful
cascade
of
carbination
formed
a
substantial
head
on
this
beer
the
color
is
a
golden
amber
that
is
just
hazy
enough
to
not
allow
clear
sight
through
the
brew
the
head
stayed
full
for
quite
a
while
and
slowly
faded
off
leaving
behind
delicate
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
gave
of
strong
send
of
toasted
malt
and
zesty
citrus
aromas
after
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
the
citrus
and
bread
qualities
of
this
beer
come
to
form
its
flavor
is
well
developed
and
quite
the
oxymoron
in
that
it
is
complex
while
keeping
its
simplicity
the
toasted
malt
and
sweet
citrus
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
but
if
you
savor
this
beer
the
malt
and
hop
complexities
truly
take
shape
a
wonderful
beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
deal
guy
ales
in
this
line
d
exceptional
i
really
enjoyed
this
brews
feel
the
breadlike
quality
in
the
texture
is
clean
and
smooth
i
hadnt
had
a
dead
guy
in
a
long
time
but
after
this
i
know
ill
be
having
another
soon
d
damn
this
may
just
have
been
the
beer
that
ive
been
waiting
for
all
my
life
its
just
made
it
into
my
top
10
with
time
and
thought
it
just
might
make
top
5
d
especially
given
the
price
the
best
selling
point
of
this
beer
simple
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
even
at
the
end
of
a
case
d
even
through
i
really
enjoy
this
ale
i
dont
have
the
desire
to
have
one
after
the
other
drink
an
excellent
session
beer
one
knock
is
that
the
bottle
doesnt
glow
in
the
dark
i
heard
a
rumor
that
it
did
and
now
im
mad
drinkability
excellent
taste
and
clean
mouthfeel
make
it
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
it
appears
a
perfectly
clear
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
head
that
retains
well
and
sticks
in
patches
about
the
glass
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
buttery
notes
citrus
hops
a
bit
of
sulfur
and
quite
grassy
taste
is
grainy
with
earthy
and
herbal
hops
the
grain
character
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
alcohol
accents
the
hop
bitterness
the
feel
is
a
bit
watery
and
light
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
lingering
presence
of
the
hops
left
in
the
mouth
as
it
warms
the
aroma
takes
on
some
notes
of
lemony
citrus
that
can
also
be
picked
out
in
the
flavor
as
well
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
either
poured
an
opaque
dark
orange
the
cream
colored
head
was
soft
froth
that
lingered
and
stuck
to
the
glass
smells
like
spicy
wet
grass
and
oak
lots
of
flavors
happening
firstly
sweet
malt
and
nutmeg
candied
yams
then
comes
the
tingling
hops
all
the
while
the
alcohol
peaking
through
the
feel
is
the
best
category
for
me
with
this
it
is
sticky
and
smooth
and
leaves
a
bitter
dry
funk
on
the
tongue
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
find
at
my
local
walmart
and
is
a
go
to
when
i
want
a
balance
of
sorts
d
very
quaffable
a
good
session
brew
actually
didnt
know
the
style
of
the
beer
when
given
one
seemed
a
little
scotch
alelike
in
its
alcoholic
content
overtone
nice
ruddy
brown
hue
with
a
sticky
tan
lace
and
full
bitteryetsmooth
character
honey
and
marmalade
hints
maibock
you
say
nice
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
went
down
great
in
the
hot
sun
poolside
with
a
cuban
cigar
d
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
to
me
its
not
a
sipping
beer
it
could
be
but
its
also
a
great
anytime
beer
this
is
one
you
can
just
start
drinking
on
at
anytime
whether
its
a
special
occasion
or
just
wanting
to
wind
down
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
an
excellent
beer
d
definitely
one
you
could
drink
a
few
of
but
of
course
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
you
wouldnt
want
to
just
sit
here
pounding
them
all
day
d
i
could
drink
this
endlessly
and
i
feel
none
of
my
friends
would
object
to
partaking
as
well
very
very
good
o
this
was
the
first
time
ive
had
dead
guy
and
i
found
it
to
be
true
to
style
as
far
as
a
hoppier
version
of
a
traditional
bock
but
i
didnt
get
the
malt
presence
that
the
style
calls
for
at
least
not
in
this
pint
i
almost
thought
i
was
drinking
a
pale
ale
which
is
alright
by
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
very
tasty
brew
from
rogue
i
had
this
on
tap
before
and
remember
it
being
a
bit
more
deeper
and
complex
in
the
flavors
maybe
that
is
just
tap
brew
being
tap
brew
though
this
is
still
very
good
though
this
is
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
brew
very
tasty
and
really
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
beer
from
the
nice
ipalike
citrusy
fruity
hoppiness
light
bitterness
and
creamy
smoothness
4

d
easy
drinking
could
have
a
couple
of
these
all
night
with
some
friends
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
while
there
is
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
nor
do
i
think
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
still
very
enjoyable
d
very
easy
to
drink
even
the
wife
who
isnt
to
big
into
beer
thought
it
was
very
nice
d
better
than
i
expected
i
did
not
notice
the
6
5
abv
til
well
into
the
second
one
these
go
down
easy
and
good
for
a
few
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
mild
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
slightly
hoppy
flavor
followed
by
more
caramel
biscuit
and
a
return
to
hops
on
the
finish
very
easydrinking
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
to
sip
when
i
dont
want
to
think
too
hard
about
whats
in
my
glass
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
not
much
else
i
can
really
say
other
than
i
could
drink
these
all
day
d
easy
drinker
used
to
be
my
favorite
brew
before
i
really
started
exploring
all
thats
out
there
always
be
one
that
i
happily
go
for
when
available
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
with
friends
and
for
an
evening
of
conversation
and
good
company
its
easy
to
have
another
sip
and
its
easy
to
have
a
second
beer
ill
probably
be
buying
this
one
again
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
maibock
style
and
thus
dont
know
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
it
is
a
fairly
interesting
combination
of
flavors
though
fairly
enjoyable
very
good
beer
to
start
your
adventure
into
tasting
and
collections
strong
for
an
ale
but
finish
smooth
have
not
tried
other
rogue
beer
yet
i
would
place
this
on
my
list
to
try
again
in
the
same
ballpark
of
ipas
and
porters
the
ibu
are
in
the
mid
range
along
with
the
alcohol
percentage
d
good
beer
and
great
style
but
not
the
best
i
come
back
to
this
brew
but
do
enjoy
other
maibocks
a
bit
more
dead
guy
does
have
a
clean
and
drinkable
tone
to
it
nice
and
light
not
thick
and
heavy
on
the
way
down
something
i
have
found
in
other
maibocks
had
to
grab
for
a
good
price
of
8
99
typically
see
this
one
at
101112
in
the
midwest
and
colo
tasty
enough
on
the
floral
side
of
hoppy
just
barely
too
strong
to
session
a
good
fall
beer
i
would
think
would
have
again
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
thats
more
my
preference
in
styles
than
the
beer
itself
though
pours
a
nice
deep
orange
caramel
malts
and
slight
sweetness
dominate
a
really
good
combination
creamy
beer
overall
creates
a
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
of
hops
balance
it
out
on
the
finish
but
the
malts
certainly
make
this
beer
nice
drinkability
overall
i
get
why
people
like
it
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
one
has
an
expected
dark
orange
color
and
a
small
somewhat
sticky
looking
head
the
smell
is
faintly
malty
and
like
burnt
candy
distinctive
and
pleasant
warming
it
smells
like
itd
be
sweet
caramel
is
the
dominant
taste
with
a
mouthcoating
kind
of
velvety
body
that
makes
it
quite
easydrinking
fullflavored
the
caramel
is
just
short
of
being
too
strong
to
the
point
of
cloying
here
i
can
see
this
one
as
being
very
enjoyable
to
sip
in
cooler
weather
it
gives
a
fuzzy
cozy
feel
d
easy
to
drink
ordered
another
one
after
the
first
bottle
and
enjoyed
it
d
at
once
challenging
and
also
perfectly
enjoyable
its
dryness
and
bitterness
seemingly
force
you
to
take
the
beer
slowly
but
this
is
perfectly
offset
but
the
smoothness
and
lightness
that
lets
you
purely
enjoy
it
dead
guy
is
one
of
the
best
from
rogue
a
solid
session
beer
im
definately
getting
this
one
again
d
enjoyable
and
quaffable
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
difficult
for
more
than
a
couple
this
has
some
peculiarities
for
the
style
as
far
as
i
can
tell
but
i
generally
dismiss
them
i
cant
get
a
straight
answer
from
anybody
if
this
is
lagered
like
a
traditional
helles
bock
or
just
an
ale
approximation
the
taste
is
ambiguous
there
too
but
ive
tried
to
see
if
my
palate
would
guide
me
ill
leave
it
at
they
should
keep
doing
what
theyre
doing
if
its
not
a
german
maibock
lets
say
its
an
american
maibock
id
like
to
see
some
brewers
do
as
well
in
an
approximation
of
styles
like
this
bring
on
the
american
maibocks
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
folks
that
like
real
beer
the
lack
of
clarity
will
frighten
the
cereal
brew
fans
but
they
would
be
missing
a
fine
example
of
beer
brewed
the
way
it
was
intended
full
flavored
and
hearty
drinkability
its
got
just
a
bit
of
tang
which
im
a
sucker
for
its
also
got
a
clean
aftertaste
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
only
downside
may
be
that
its
a
bit
strongalcoholic
beautifully
crafted
maibock
too
sweet
and
malty
for
my
taste
but
fits
the
style
nice
hared
to
get
in
uk
but
will
be
making
the
effort
to
find
more
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
hop
bitterness
and
crisp
yet
understated
carbonation
serve
to
clean
up
any
residual
stickiness
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
a
good
session
beer
for
those
crazy
high
abv
drinking
yanks
i
gave
it
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
it
didnt
come
up
with
too
much
head
maybe
a
finger
or
so
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
it
had
very
little
visible
carbonation
just
a
few
tiny
bubbles
and
a
gorgeous
golden
amber
color
the
smell
is
of
malt
a
slight
touch
of
hops
in
the
back
sweet
bread
and
i
catch
almost
a
little
carmel
and
brown
sugar
in
there
too
some
medium
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
mouth
feel
is
real
silky
to
me
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
going
on
so
it
lays
easy
on
the
tongue
and
with
the
smooth
flavors
with
just
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
its
real
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
with
friends
and
feeling
good
at
a
6
5
abv
with
this
drinkability
good
stuff
overall
i
love
maibocks
this
is
a
good
beer
would
buy
again
but
not
too
often
i
have
had
some
better
maibocks
in
various
brewpubs
but
this
is
still
a
great
and
enjoyable
effort
by
rogue
pretty
good
beer
though
i
also
recommend
the
john
john
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
dead
guy
ale
aged
in
barrels
of
whiskey
that
was
distilled
from
dead
guy
wort
yum
interesting
but
id
never
have
considered
it
a
maibock
if
it
had
been
a
blind
tasting
too
weak
in
the
mouthfeel
for
me
the
first
time
i
had
dead
guy
i
wasnt
that
impressed
but
this
was
a
totally
different
experience
it
smelled
faintly
of
raisins
and
hops
pretty
good
i
tasted
mostly
dark
fruits
and
lime
it
was
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
i
felt
it
was
appropriate
the
balance
is
excellent
making
this
highly
drinkable
is
dead
guy
an
ale
or
is
it
a
lager
i
think
that
question
is
moot
this
beer
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
great
maibock
so
well
just
leave
it
that
dvery
drinkable
im
going
to
celebrate
my
bday
with
this
beer
my
friends
and
fam
will
love
it
too
d
the
crispiness
from
earlier
makes
this
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
not
overbearing
at
all
and
goes
down
very
easily
definitely
would
have
another
good
beer
gets
a
b
from
me
reminds
me
of
an
english
ale
malty
but
clean
good
nose
liked
that
i
could
buy
it
in
a
24
oz
bottle
instead
of
a
sixpack
here
in
nj
will
definitely
buy
a
six
next
time
nice
balanced
beer
best
rogue
beer
ive
had
drinkability
drinkability
is
pretty
good
d
a
very
solid
drinking
maibock
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
to
be
called
truly
delicious
but
its
a
great
brew
and
the
6
5
abv
doesnt
hand
out
a
boozy
effect
in
the
taste
or
feel
would
like
to
try
ontap
to
note
variations
in
mouthfeel
a
little
more
crisp
and
this
brew
could
be
really
dangerous
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
large
tan
fluffy
head
good
lacing
and
lively
carbonation
sweet
malts
carmel
molasses
and
hints
of
burnt
nutty
like
flavors
light
piney
hop
feel
as
well
maybe
some
hints
of
toffee
medium
body
with
an
oily
creamy
texture
that
was
slightly
fizzy
moderately
sweet
with
an
average
flavor
duration
that
finished
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
all
around
fantastic
beer
first
rouge
beer
ive
tried
and
was
very
impressed
no
freshness
date
d
good
refreshing
beer
i
would
get
this
one
again
pretty
good
overall
worth
trying
for
sure
its
like
a
more
subtle
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
combined
with
an
american
wheat
like
mothership
wit
less
hop
bittering
less
wheat
fruit
notes
are
the
product
but
it
retains
a
sweet
malty
body
and
enough
hopping
to
keep
you
entertained
very
well
balanced
malty
delight
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
toasted
malts
great
brew
the
high
price
of
rogue
is
the
only
reason
i
would
not
regularly
buy
this
brew
overall
i
could
definitely
place
this
within
my
spectrum
of
sessionable
beers
great
drinkable
and
delicious
what
is
great
about
this
beer
is
that
it
balances
everything
perfectly
not
too
dense
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
an
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
brew
for
sure
probably
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
session
beer
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
while
i
dont
find
it
to
be
amazing
its
still
not
bad
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
d
this
is
just
a
really
easy
to
drink
beer
it
is
smooth
refreshing
and
different
and
at
6
5
abv
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
one
bomber
and
even
a
second
if
it
is
there
to
drink
enjoyed
this
beer
in
a
s
a
glass
distinctive
aroma
great
medium
malty
taste
with
a
nice
hop
presence
and
finish
around
4050
ibus
as
a
home
brewer
i
can
identify
the
distinct
pac
man
yeast
feels
real
nice
in
the
mouth
color
is
nice
i
will
frequent
his
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
ligh
carbonation
head
fades
very
quickly
into
light
lacing
smell
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
but
faily
hoppy
indeed
drinkability
is
easy
and
the
taste
hits
the
spot
easy
beer
to
just
sit
with
and
hang
out
for
awhile
will
be
purchasing
this
one
agian
in
the
near
future
beautiful
copper
color
with
very
nice
head
and
lacing
throughout
tried
my
first
maibock
a
little
while
back
and
am
always
on
the
look
out
for
this
beer
style
this
one
is
crisp
but
sweet
mild
carbonation
excellent
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
and
again
wish
i
got
more
than
one
bottle
drinkability
tasty
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
a
really
good
beer
complex
flavors
that
really
balance
themselves
outwell
very
impressed
pours
a
nice
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
finger
head
that
stays
for
quite
a
while
and
leaves
a
good
trail
of
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
hop
presence
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
at
first
but
follows
with
a
heavy
malt
presence
has
a
very
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malt
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
drinkable
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
finishing
slightly
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
brew
i
cant
help
but
compare
dead
guy
to
its
bourbon
barrelaged
version
john
john
ale
which
i
tried
awhile
back
but
havent
gotten
around
to
reviewing
regular
dead
guy
is
more
easygoing
and
runofthemill
than
john
john
but
arguably
just
as
tasty
this
statement
is
not
meant
to
denigrade
john
john
but
only
to
praise
dead
guy
because
my
logic
says
that
if
a
beer
can
even
hold
a
candle
to
a
bourboninfused
version
of
itself
it
has
to
be
pretty
good
notes
i
was
not
expecting
the
complexity
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
every
seem
overly
complex
though
all
the
flavors
and
aromas
work
in
perfect
harmony
without
seeming
like
its
trying
too
hard
i
really
enjoyed
rogue
dead
guy
ale
it
pours
a
very
dark
orange
color
there
is
some
nice
head
which
lingers
and
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
actually
the
taste
seems
to
be
bitter
at
first
but
then
finishes
sweeter
than
i
anticipated
the
initial
bitterness
may
hinder
the
drinkability
for
some
but
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
dvery
drinkable
i
like
this
more
and
more
as
i
get
farther
down
the
glass
drinkability
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
has
some
bite
to
it
as
well
because
of
the
amount
of
hoppyness
overall
it
is
refreshing
but
i
dont
think
itd
be
very
enjoyable
if
its
consumed
too
quickly
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
warmish
spring
night
fairly
simple
flavor
profile
but
the
flavors
mesh
well
balance
is
present
and
the
beer
is
indeed
drinkable
overall
well
rounded
with
a
pleasant
aroma
highly
drinkable
and
very
delicious
this
is
one
i
like
to
revisit
this
is
a
good
enough
beer
but
overpriced
and
overhyped
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
and
probably
not
something
i
will
buy
again
when
i
can
get
similar
beers
for
half
the
price
ahh
good
old
dead
guy
has
been
a
fall
back
for
me
for
many
a
year
very
malty
and
smooth
as
you
would
ecpect
head
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
with
a
nice
toffee
hue
to
it
the
taste
is
bits
of
chocolate
and
caramel
just
a
great
sort
of
malty
flavor
a
solid
beer
could
have
one
of
these
everyday
a
tasty
beer
to
be
sure
it
has
a
sameness
that
is
common
to
the
rogue
beers
but
it
isnt
detrimental
tasty
consumed
from
a
tulipesque
aventinus
manglass
smells
strongly
of
2row
pale
base
malt
and
buttery
diacetyl
good
head
retention
tastes
like
the
aroma
strong
malty
character
from
pale
malt
as
well
as
a
nice
balance
of
butter
from
diacetyl
but
does
not
overpower
dryer
finish
than
expected
great
hop
balance
suprisingly
refreshing
for
the
style
d
totally
drinkable
im
drinking
this
on
a
warm
night
and
its
just
so
soothing
and
tasty
in
the
warm
air
this
could
be
a
real
nice
go
to
spring
beer
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
i
essentially
quaffed
this
down
while
waiting
to
be
seated
and
not
intentionally
i
just
looked
down
at
the
glass
and
realized
most
of
it
was
gone
before
i
could
slow
myself
down
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
if
there
are
no
better
choices
in
the
future
i
may
have
this
instead
of
a
sa
bl
of
sn
pa
md
pretty
smooth
brew
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
but
very
tasty
for
sure
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
well
balanced
brew
that
should
be
tried
this
for
sure
will
be
bought
again
d
very
tasty
ale
quite
refreshing
and
wellbalanced
definitely
one
id
gladly
have
more
of
i
would
definitely
get
this
on
again
next
i
will
try
the
double
dead
guy
one
of
my
faves
by
rogue
is
thier
brutal
bitter
this
dead
guy
ale
is
more
dirnkable
and
smoother
than
the
brutal
which
i
like
a
lot
dthis
is
a
decent
brew
and
has
a
good
bit
of
balance
good
malt
presence
nice
hop
backing
a
little
rough
on
the
edges
but
still
a
decent
d
good
refreshing
beer
would
definetly
purchase
as
a
session
beer
overall
this
is
ok
probably
the
rating
suffers
from
being
compared
to
other
rogue
beers
maybe
this
is
too
hoppy
for
the
style
just
a
tinge
less
hops
would
have
been
better
balanced
to
me
drinkability
its
not
too
complex
but
its
tasty
its
a
wellbuilt
beer
very
smooth
however
i
was
expecting
nothing
short
of
orgasm
for
a
10
sixer
awesome
beer
not
the
best
i
ever
had
but
would
defiantly
buy
again
i
can
easily
see
this
beer
becoming
one
of
my
go
to
beers
d
the
unusual
flavors
in
this
brew
make
for
an
interesting
drinking
experience
but
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
consider
sessionable
this
brew
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
easy
to
quaff
down
quite
a
few
if
you
arent
careful
great
price
point
too
overall
interesting
beer
which
tastes
like
what
they
call
it
though
perhaps
a
bit
too
toasted
ale
fermentation
adds
some
intesting
flavors
and
the
hops
just
didint
meld
well
for
me
more
interesting
than
anything
a
bit
of
a
kitchen
sink
beer
in
my
mind
copper
with
orange
hues
small
head
with
light
retention
and
lacing
small
nose
of
bread
and
toasted
grains
malt
is
balanced
nicely
with
a
moderate
dose
of
floral
hops
that
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
to
style
nope
tasty
yes
very
fluid
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
quite
drinkable
with
a
slight
alcohol
finish
good
beer
that
is
widely
available
this
is
my
first
beer
review
after
three
bottles
all
on
different
days
i
feel
like
i
have
a
pretty
good
sense
of
this
beer
its
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
but
short
lived
head
like
the
flavor
its
smell
is
balanced
with
caramel
malts
and
terrific
citrus
esters
the
hops
are
stronger
on
the
palate
than
sensed
by
the
nose
but
much
more
subdued
than
an
american
ipa
for
instance
i
find
this
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
so
far
dead
guy
ale
may
bore
those
who
prefer
a
heavily
hopped
beer
the
style
confuses
me
i
would
have
called
this
an
amber
ale
so
much
to
learn
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
everyone
as
a
beer
to
be
tasted
the
only
thing
i
could
for
that
this
beer
does
not
deliver
on
is
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
to
swirl
in
but
i
cannot
mark
off
any
points
for
that
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beer
an
ale
brewed
with
the
same
ingredients
as
a
maibock
creating
a
similar
flavor
with
some
extra
fruity
esters
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
overall
and
a
maker
for
a
decent
session
ale
its
not
all
that
complex
so
its
hard
for
me
to
get
excited
about
though
it
is
damn
drinkable
and
there
is
very
little
wrong
with
this
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
hyped
up
a
lot
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
accessible
craft
beers
a
damn
good
beer
worth
the
price
no
i
love
the
way
the
finish
reveals
before
drying
and
fading
herbal
notes
a
hint
of
forest
it
even
reminds
me
of
a
british
pale
ale
beefed
up
but
not
in
the
american
ipa
sense
hops
stay
low
near
perfection
for
what
it
is
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
beer
i
am
a
big
porter
fan
and
im
in
love
with
any
dark
beer
and
this
is
the
best
beer
i
think
you
can
buy
at
a
grocery
store
or
any
market
like
it
the
beer
drinks
so
smooth
for
how
dark
it
is
and
tastes
of
a
hint
of
caramel
within
the
full
body
a
true
classic
one
of
my
favorites
anytime
i
go
to
the
bar
dm
very
nice
medium
body
beer
with
good
malt
profile
and
good
drinkability
nice
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
initial
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
the
bitter
hops
are
strongest
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
overpowering
a
well
balanced
beer
which
i
would
buy
again
a
middleoftheroad
beer
in
terms
of
body
good
for
anytime
and
very
drinkable
for
sure
d
may
have
this
again
if
i
find
a
sixer
defiantly
a
good
beer
to
buy
definitely
a
solid
brew
not
my
favorite
but
some
nice
flavors
has
a
mild
hop
presence
mainly
presenting
earthy
notes
but
with
a
hint
of
citrus
as
well
strong
malt
presence
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
some
toasted
malt
flavors
finishes
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
prefer
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
good
brew
but
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
thats
incredibly
well
balanced
not
my
style
of
beer
but
very
well
brewed
nonetheless
rogue
has
better
offerings
like
double
dead
guy
but
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
thats
very
drinkable
is
noteworthy
d
im
gonna
start
off
by
saying
that
this
is
my
first
maibock
so
im
not
sure
what
the
exact
style
is
shooting
for
it
does
have
a
nice
hop
profile
and
is
lighter
in
color
although
im
not
getting
any
alcohol
coming
through
i
really
am
enjoying
it
though
its
a
nice
refreshing
lager
spliced
with
some
great
ale
characteristics
another
top
notch
rogue
offering
cant
believe
im
only
getting
around
to
trying
it
for
the
first
time
now
d
decent
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
in
a
session
great
beer
to
build
on
but
for
the
price
lets
leave
it
at
that
35
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
drink
the
entire
six
pack
in
a
sitting
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
rogue
breweryexcept
double
dead
guy
which
is
even
tastier
one
of
the
earlier
available
microbrews
ten
or
so
years
ago
this
was
one
that
was
surprisingly
interesting
since
it
was
a
german
style
lager
rather
than
the
typical
ales
that
you
found
from
most
micros
great
color
and
aroma
very
malt
forward
with
a
great
flavor
much
better
on
tap
than
in
bottles
overall
an
outstanding
american
beer
i
can
be
proud
to
drink
anywhere
d
overall
pretty
good
im
glad
that
rogue
is
so
easy
to
find
because
you
know
your
always
getting
a
solid
beer
d
easy
to
throw
a
6er
of
these
down
im
glad
rogue
bottles
these
in
the
12oz
bottles
theyre
starting
to
become
a
regular
staple
in
my
fridge
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
have
and
will
drink
again
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
honey
malty
flavor
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
just
right
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
really
good
beer
d
definitely
a
do
over
i
could
throw
down
a
few
after
dinner
as
a
dessert
and
not
be
completely
immobilized
bottle
home
this
beer
is
somewhere
between
tawny
and
mahogany
in
color
the
head
is
offwhite
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
sweet
subtle
caramel
malt
with
some
light
fruity
hops
the
flavor
is
a
tad
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
mildly
sour
lagermalt
flavor
but
its
wellbalanced
and
goes
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
has
always
seemed
a
tad
odd
to
me
i
get
a
funny
graininess
at
first
dead
guy
wont
bowl
you
over
with
complexity
but
its
a
solid
beer
and
its
easy
to
see
why
it
has
converted
many
a
macro
drinker
this
beer
is
one
that
ranks
up
thier
at
the
top
of
my
list
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beeri
can
arcoss
the
beer
by
sure
happenstance
i
was
in
the
outer
banks
and
was
at
a
huge
beer
store
and
could
not
decide
what
to
geti
saw
the
bottle
out
of
the
coner
of
my
eyewhy
notonce
i
got
back
to
the
room
and
opened
it
i
was
hooked
right
awayit
was
one
of
the
bestthats
all
i
can
saytry
it
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
i
fogot
how
good
it
is
this
is
a
fine
piece
of
work
from
rogue
and
im
already
looking
forward
to
my
next
overall
this
is
a
solid
well
balanced
beer
that
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
in
a
sitting
great
for
a
ball
game
d
i
could
drink
about
two
maybe
three
of
these
before
i
would
want
to
switch
onto
something
else
very
malty
aroma
hit
me
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
on
this
bad
boy
an
off
white
2
finger
head
with
big
bubbles
diminishes
quickly
leaving
a
perfect
rind
on
the
wall
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
like
walking
through
the
doors
of
a
brewery
the
wonderful
malty
smell
hits
you
fallowed
by
a
light
hops
the
body
color
is
simply
printed
on
the
bottle
deep
honey
in
color
not
any
room
to
argue
that
one
theyre
dead
on
has
a
great
full
mouth
feel
nice
and
chewy
with
tastes
of
wheat
and
honey
oh
and
dont
forget
a
great
balance
of
malts
and
hops
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
d
very
smooth
beer
refreshing
and
nothing
is
too
overwhelming
note
mine
may
have
been
aged
a
year
or
more
due
to
the
fact
that
i
bought
it
at
a
liquor
store
that
doesnt
move
allot
of
its
craft
beer
quickly
and
is
known
for
stocking
old
beer
to
still
make
a
profit
definitely
an
improvement
over
my
ontap
review
looks
like
i
did
indeed
have
a
bad
pour
and
this
beer
is
redeemed
have
had
this
on
bottle
and
draft
hands
down
the
draft
is
where
its
at
at
200
per
keg
i
probably
wont
be
buying
too
many
more
kegs
but
i
will
always
buy
the
jug
drinkability
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
good
its
not
going
to
make
my
top
ten
or
anything
but
certainly
worth
taking
note
of
people
can
complain
about
rogues
prices
all
they
want
to
but
i
know
i
never
have
to
worry
about
not
being
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
and
it
is
an
incredible
jumping
off
point
to
craft
beers
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
must
say
this
should
probably
be
the
beer
for
converting
macro
drinkers
thanks
a
bunch
rogue
m
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
i
agree
with
some
other
reviews
it
does
have
a
syrupy
texture
but
perhaps
its
the
caramel
flavor
that
gives
that
impression
poured
650ml
bottle
pours
honey
colored
with
small
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
hops
along
with
some
hints
of
caramel
flavor
is
bigtime
fruity
and
flowery
hops
its
bitter
and
hoppy
but
it
does
go
down
smooth
well
balanced
and
quite
nice
and
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
a
descent
brew
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
going
on
here
the
only
thing
that
turned
me
off
was
the
cough
syrup
aftertaste
worth
a
try
nonetheless
very
drinkable
goes
down
easily
i
enjoyed
this
and
will
probably
keep
some
on
hand
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
refreshing
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
and
will
not
disappoint
d
hell
yeah
ill
drink
this
anytime
12
oz
bottle
served
in
shaker
the
commercial
description
fits
this
one
well
aroma
of
caramel
malts
with
floral
and
spicy
hops
bright
honey
colored
with
a
thin
off
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
pleasing
alcohol
warmth
nicely
balanced
medium
body
and
gently
carbonated
highly
recommended
d
im
still
a
little
confused
as
to
this
beers
style
and
my
attempt
to
place
it
is
having
an
interesting
effect
on
my
reaction
to
the
flavors
id
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
and
review
it
there
as
well
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
a
little
different
from
most
of
the
beers
that
i
have
tries
in
this
style
but
good
none
the
less
seems
a
little
heavy
too
drink
more
than
2
or
3
in
one
session
di
could
slowly
session
this
beer
all
night
goes
down
very
smooth
a
wonderful
offering
but
too
overpriced
indeed
i
got
this
on
a
mixed
sixer
so
is
wasnt
bad
i
would
never
pay
11
dollars
for
this
really
good
maibock
unfortunately
the
style
does
not
allow
it
to
stand
out
too
much
from
other
beers
the
hint
of
spruce
at
the
end
really
defines
this
beer
and
much
of
the
others
from
rogue
and
makes
you
remember
it
if
you
didnt
like
it
try
it
again
a
second
time
with
an
open
mind
and
i
think
you
will
find
it
more
welcoming
a
very
drinkable
tasty
and
balanced
beer
pours
golden
haze
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
head
laces
the
glass
smells
citrusy
with
sweet
malt
initial
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
finished
with
herbal
hops
light
mouth
feel
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
offering
by
rogue
and
is
a
go
to
brew
when
i
am
looking
for
refreshment
if
you
see
this
on
tap
somewhere
which
isnt
difficult
to
find
i
assure
you
wont
be
dissappointed
i
wasnt
sure
about
it
at
first
with
all
the
sediment
floating
around
in
the
bottle
this
is
shockingly
delicious
d
a
solid
enough
brew
and
i
enjoyed
it
the
yeast
character
of
rogue
beers
have
never
been
a
favorite
of
mine
but
the
maltiness
helps
to
push
that
towards
afterthought
nothing
wrong
with
this
ale
another
good
beer
from
rogue
there
could
be
more
flavor
on
the
palate
though
libation
a
very
well
put
together
ale
almost
perfectly
balanced
for
the
style
very
interesting
savory
spicy
flavors
are
well
balanced
with
a
small
hop
character
extremely
dangerously
drinkable
clearly
one
of
the
better
offering
in
this
style
ill
be
back
the
prototypical
new
world
maibock
despite
the
confusing
name
and
with
verily
big
malts
nicely
cut
with
soft
but
effective
balancing
fruity
hops
very
drinkable
at
this
particular
bookend
of
my
beerdrinking
years
overall
a
good
solid
drinkable
beer
this
is
my
first
maibock
and
thus
the
ratings
may
change
as
i
try
more
it
is
not
perhaps
the
most
outstanding
example
of
a
maibock
but
it
is
very
accessible
and
generally
available
a
nice
orangeycopperbrown
this
one
has
a
halfinch
white
head
on
top
of
it
head
fades
relatively
quickly
but
leaves
behind
some
nice
lacing
something
about
the
smell
to
me
is
offputting
and
i
cant
quite
place
it
in
any
case
im
getting
some
lightly
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
taste
follows
suit
but
the
malt
definitely
dominates
with
roasted
flavors
and
amber
malts
coming
through
some
nutty
flavors
toohazelnut
for
one
a
hint
of
hops
pushes
through
though
they
are
minor
feel
is
nothing
special
pretty
typical
for
an
ale
though
i
guess
slightly
above
average
for
creaminess
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
i
could
figure
out
what
i
dont
like
about
the
smell
of
this
beer
theres
just
something
i
dont
like
ive
had
it
in
bottles
and
have
noticed
the
same
thing
in
any
case
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
beer
this
is
my
first
maibock
so
i
really
do
not
have
anything
to
compare
dead
guy
with
it
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
though
not
exceptional
its
not
outstanding
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
malt
bomby
but
still
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
character
but
the
malt
wood
tobacco
feel
overwhelms
the
hop
character
as
it
continues
the
dirt
earth
dark
mahoganny
feel
to
the
bottle
increases
and
youre
just
about
over
this
beer
dvery
drinkable
the
beer
gives
a
good
balance
like
a
maibock
should
a
nice
spicyness
and
a
good
strong
maly
flavor
while
not
being
too
heavy
d
great
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
hit
the
mark
with
beer
mellow
yet
complex
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
half
inch
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
the
appearance
is
light
amber
and
cloudy
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
moderately
bitter
with
malt
sweetness
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
flat
finish
this
is
a
delicious
and
drinkable
ale
d
this
is
a
unique
session
brew
that
doesnt
necessarily
need
to
be
poured
into
a
glass
as
far
as
i
can
tell
there
is
nothing
truly
appealing
about
its
appearance
but
the
true
testament
of
a
good
brew
is
its
taste
and
drinkability
this
one
has
both
light
copper
color
gold
hilights
small
white
head
leaves
thin
lacing
some
hop
smell
a
bit
of
citrus
but
not
very
strong
malty
taste
slightly
sweet
to
start
then
you
get
a
dose
of
floral
and
citrusy
hops
sweet
aftertaste
good
carbonation
level
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
sessional
option
d
one
of
my
favorite
american
beers
i
would
like
to
celebrate
the
next
dia
de
muertos
drinking
this
beer
fantastic
lots
of
flavour
within
while
resisting
the
urge
to
become
incredibly
intense
which
would
limit
it
to
one
or
two
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
a
session
beer
pours
a
light
burnt
orange
color
reminiscent
of
a
sunset
on
the
horizon
really
beautiful
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
great
stark
white
soapy
looking
head
that
leaves
a
decent
ring
of
lace
on
the
glass
it
has
a
nose
of
sweet
malt
citrus
hop
some
bread
and
yeast
character
and
hints
of
coriander
maybe
even
some
wheat
notes
as
usual
the
sweet
malt
strikes
first
followed
by
some
citrus
and
bread
that
converge
into
a
floral
hop
taste
with
a
minor
bitter
finish
this
is
a
nice
and
crisp
beer
with
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
very
well
balanced
beer
with
a
good
malt
backbone
and
a
strong
hoppy
prescence
this
is
very
visually
appealing
beer
with
a
constant
head
and
lace
throughout
that
keeps
it
attractive
till
the
end
the
taste
is
equally
appealing
with
a
great
blend
of
sweet
and
floral
flavors
that
keeps
it
complex
while
it
still
something
that
can
be
drank
in
quantity
which
is
a
hard
balance
thing
to
achieve
in
beer
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
nice
rich
creamy
body
wasnt
lacking
a
thing
carbonation
was
spot
on
not
distracting
from
the
smooth
delivery
great
beer
and
relatively
easy
to
find
d
the
taste
makes
me
want
more
starts
out
a
bit
rough
but
then
grows
on
you
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
4
or
more
before
going
to
something
lighter
d
excellent
brew
overall
perfect
for
the
style
refreshing
and
bold
an
absolute
delight
with
spicy
food
the
feel
is
good
for
this
style
of
pretty
and
its
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
something
that
knocks
your
socks
off
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
will
probably
have
again
now
is
this
still
a
maibock
if
you
brew
it
with
an
ale
yeast
drinkability
really
good
definitely
will
drink
more
notes
strong
flavorful
lager
with
malt
and
bitterness
well
balanced
delicious
beer
probably
one
of
my
favorites
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
is
very
drinkable
rogue
continues
to
impress
me
with
nearly
all
of
their
beers
poured
with
a
deep
orangeish
color
with
a
very
thin
head
nose
is
faint
hops
and
malts
and
some
citrus
taste
is
a
sweet
citruslike
taste
which
was
sordove
oversome
with
malt
refreshing
but
a
little
more
syrupy
and
bitter
than
the
draft
version
almost
two
different
brews
from
bottle
to
draft
d
does
this
come
in
6
or
12
packs
great
brew
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
which
should
appeal
to
a
diverse
crowd
its
like
a
cross
between
a
bock
and
an
american
pale
ale
dry
hoppy
and
light
but
still
fairly
well
balanced
has
the
stickiness
of
a
bock
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
that
makes
me
think
pale
ale
its
one
of
those
beers
i
dont
buy
too
often
but
when
someone
throws
it
in
the
cooler
in
the
springsummertime
im
all
about
it
very
complex
and
smoothe
flavor
the
ale
pours
brilliant
honeyamber
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
the
nose
has
a
nice
balance
of
yeast
and
malt
quite
pleasant
the
carbonation
is
welldeveloped
and
very
pleasant
with
very
small
bubbles
the
body
is
mediumlight
much
lighter
than
i
would
expect
of
a
bock
but
then
this
is
a
maibock
which
is
traditionally
lighter
it
is
also
rather
dry
and
lightly
hopped
the
lacing
is
very
light
and
sparse
excellent
with
lighter
foods
or
deepfried
foods
quenching
i
am
not
certain
that
if
i
was
a
monk
and
this
was
a
mealreplacement
ale
i
would
be
totally
satiated
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
on
the
palate
but
shows
itself
after
a
few
sips
the
lingering
is
very
pleasant
and
the
malt
shows
very
nicely
accompanied
by
notes
of
honey
matchbox6pint
great
fall

brew
good
with
hearty

overall

solid
allaround
brew
pretty
good
not
spectacular
though
very
drinkable
very
slightly
cloudy

pretty
thin
had
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
had
a
sweet
smell
of
toasty

really
had
no
hops
smell
to
speak
of
sweet
malt
taste
with
honey
i
just
didnt
get
any
aura
of
hops
carbonation
and
feel
were
quite
nice
but
the
taste
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
didnt
notice
any
alcohol
didnt
really
notice
anything
in
particular
it
was
as
my
score
indicates
just
average
d
good
beer
plain
and
simple
easy
to
drink
23
of
these
my
favorite
rouge
beer
and
always
worth
drinking
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
full
one
swish
around
the
mouth
and
the
beer
foams
up
into
a
rich
thick
beer
quite
nice
there
are
nice
parts
of
this
beer
but
as
a
whole
it
takes
a
bit
of
a
knock
from
me
mostly
because
i
found
there
to
be
a
bit
of
a
clash
in
some
of
the
beer
characteristics
going
on
good
parts
but
didnt
come
across
as
a
unified
whole
to
me
d
good
drinkable
beer
thought
that
tealike
astringency
does
kind
of
build
up
an
awesome
drinker
ive
had
this
beer
all
the
time
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
to
me
its
a
one
of
a
kind
well
ok
its
the
only
maibock
helles
bock
poured
an
smallish
white
head
into
a
standard
pint
glass
rich
amber
in
color
not
as
much
clarity
as
i
would
have
expected
nice
lacing
smells
honeyed
and
grapefruity
tastes
of
caramel
with
a
citrus
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
to
drink
moderate
carbonation
perhaps
a
bit
watery
drinkability
is
very
good
moderately
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
summer
beer
das
said
earlier
can
barely
taste
the
6

alcohol
so
great
drinkability
happy
medium
between
a
sipper
and
something
i
could
quaff
down
5
of
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
yearround
brews
drinkability
4
55
0
would
definitely
drink
again
very
good
pale
ale
more
approachable
than
an
ipa
d
this
is
the
definition
of
quaffable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
fine
balance
and
the
addition
of
the
fruitiness
is
very
drinkable
and
nowhere
near
overpowering
id
say
that
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
a
helles
bock
and
i
liked
this
version
of
the
style
but
i
dont
have
alot
to
compare
it
to
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
me
to
make
it
a
personal
session
beer
i
think
that
you
can
get
some
rogue
beers
here
now
too
so
that
is
niceseems
like
they
know
what
they
are
doing
d
good
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
tasty
good
maibock
despite
technically
being
an
ale
another
great
rogue
beer
poured
out
of
the
64
ounce
growler
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
with
some
lacing
nose
is
sweet
with
a
berry
tone
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bitter
edge
on
the
tail
mouth
is
smooth
and
a
little
bit
heavy
with
a
slight
bit
of
bubble
that
clings
to
your
mouth
extremely
drinkable
due
to
its
smooth
tone
and
flavor
excellent
brew
pours
an
orangish
copperish
color
with
a
moderate
frothy
white
head
the
head
gives
way
to
a
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
sweet
malt
characteristic
the
taste
is
of
a
mild
citrus
hop
bite
with
a
slight
fruit
note
to
balance
out
the
harshness
of
the
hop
there
is
also
a
slight
sweet
malt
characteristic
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
good
hop
characteristic
without
being
overly
hoppy
overall
the
flavor
is
good
and
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
this
beer
a
very
fine
beer
indeed
the
one
drawback
being
i
couldnt
see
myself
quaffing
this
in
mass
quantities
the
almost
overpowering
malt
would
be
a
bit
too
much
from
my
poor
pallets
sweet
receptors
after
a
while
leaving
my
mouth
feeling
very
dry
i
would
definitely
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
malt
fix
to
have
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
its
tightly
carbonated
with
a
strong
crisp
finish
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
in
this
department
its
a
needed
kick
that
cuts
through
a
thick
texture
well
balanced
and
has
a
sticky
body
a
staining
aftertaste
still
i
do
feel
its
missing
something
an
intangible
to
put
it
over
the
top
its
a
bit
pricey
but
close
to
worth
the
premium
picked
up
a
6pack
of
this
at
the
whole
foods
in
nashville
a
nice
offering
from
our
friends
at
rogue
an
exemplification
of
the
style
imho
pours
a
nice
coppery
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
and
a
nice
longlasting
lace
great
caramely
malt
backbone
some
fruit
well
balanced
with
appropriate
hops
a
good
standby
and
a
great
session
beer
with
a
relatively
low
abv
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
nice
dark
in
color
and
small
maybe
half
inch
head
very
dry
and
quite
bitter
on
my
tongue
was
better
after
the
first
two
drinks
and
went
down
rather
smooth
i
liked
it
more
as
i
had
it
nothing
really
stood
out
though
a
definite
standby
brew
and
one
i
can
recommend
solid
classic
in
my
book
an
old
standby
in
my
days
at
the
other
side
is
there
better
likely
but
that
does
not
diminish
a
fine
beer
a
hazy
reddish
gold
pour
to
copperbrown
with
thinnish
white
head
but
lace
that
sticks
about
the
aroma
advertises
the
floralpiney
hops
more
than
the
nice
roast
malts
that
balance
it
the
flavor
as
said
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
hop
with
honey
pine
qualities
the
feel
is
a
crisp
biting
carbonation
with
dry
finish
that
provides
for
a
clean
drinkable
sensation
a
great
old
standby
very
drinkable
for
6
5
were
it
not
for
the
price
tag
id
be
inclined
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
i
think
there
are
cheaper
options
of
comparable
quality
still
this
is
a
solid
beer
thats
very
enjoyable
to
drink
d
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
full
flavored
lager
final
thoughts
given
the
only
maibock
ive
had
before
was
holsten
im
quite
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
diversity
out
of
this
and
frankly
if
the
hop
presence
wasnt
so
varied
this
beer
would
be
abysmal
im
guessing
this
beer
is
rated
so
high
is
because
it
probably
made
a
lot
of
people
realize
that
they
are
hop
heads
that
doesnt
do
it
for
me
though
for
me
a
beer
needs
balance
which
this
beer
is
in
need
of
tastes
well
basically
like
it
smells
very
drinkable
and
the
spices
are
noticable
right
away
on
the
tounge
and
last
long
after
you
finish
once
you
have
had
dead
guy
ale
i
definately
recomend
getting
rogues
double
dead
guy
overall
my
natural
reaction
was
to
hate
this
beer
for
all
its
hype
the
company
gets
this
brew
isnt
to
shabby
ive
only
had
this
one
and
a
couple
sips
from
their
hazelnut
brown
nectar
and
both
are
good
i
say
pick
this
one
up
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
if
youre
lookin
for
a
good
lager
fill
dthis
is
one
of
the
better
rogue
beers
i
have
had
and
would
gladly
drink
again
wont
buy
with
any
regularity
since
priced
higher
than
other
beers
i
like
better
it
was
the
best
choice
among
bottled
beers
at
a
restaurant
this
summer
and
will
find
similar
use
in
my
future
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
with
the
slightest
of
haze
the
flavour
is
pretty
bland
to
be
honest
a
little
sweet
not
shitty
but
nothing
stands
out
either
the
after
taste
is
a
little
annoying
in
this
beer
dont
notice
the
6
6
at
all
so
its
easy
to
drink
this
just
doesnt
have
any
personality
very
average
beer
drinkability
had
i
not
split
this
beer
with
someone
else
i
definitely
could
have
finished
the
whole
thing
myself
a
nice
balanced
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
a
good
choice
with
a
meal
ill
have
to
try
it
again
and
see
if
i
think
more
of
it
a
pale
hazy
orange
with
a
rocky
white
head
and
an
adequate
amount
of
lace
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
the
weak
link
in
this
one
a
bit
underwhelming
but
not
at
least
slightly
better
than
average
hoppy
citrus
aroma
the
flavor
leads
with
a
balanced
citrus
hop
attack
that
finds
a
nice
medium
between
sweet
orange
and
a
drier
grapefruit
this
is
followed
by
a
sugar
cookie
maltiness
in
the
middle
that
evolves
into
a
slight
sweetness
before
finishing
with
a
dry
hop
note
i
felt
like
the
alcohol
peeked
its
head
out
just
slightly
but
i
had
to
try
hard
to
pick
it
up
light
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
and
representing
a
wide
range
of
flavors
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
shows
a
nice
complexity
and
though
its
a
little
high
on
the
abv
it
might
make
a
good
session
beer
certainly
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
its
kind
d
the
smell
and
taste
is
great
especially
the
way
it
presents
fruit
and
hop
flavors
i
could
drink
many
of
these
on
their
own
but
they
would
be
even
better
with
finger
foods
every
rogue
product
i
have
makes
me
love
the
company
that
much
more
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
rich
in
both
smell
and
taste
but
goes
down
very
easy
cant
wait
to
have
their
double
dead
guy
for
my
100th
review
also
served
at
the
yard
house
in
waikiki
medium
hazy
amber
in
color
with
a
thick
head
had
a
nice
biscuity
scent
with
a
decent
amount
of
hop
spice
not
very
strong
but
pleasant
toasted
malt
and
barley
with
some
floral
notes
emerging
as
a
resuly
of
the
hops
becoming
richer
as
it
warmed
up
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
adding
to
the
overall
flavor
at
all
stages
and
went
down
extremely
smooth
for
a
beer
of
this
complexity
might
be
a
little
strong
to
be
considered
sessionable
my
many
standards
but
nonetheless
equally
enjoyable
in
both
complexity
and
drinkability
im
still
relatively
new
to
the
craft
beer
universe
but
this
and
dogfishs
60
min
ipa
are
my
favorites
these
are
my
gotos
when
im
at
the
bar
congrats
to
rouge
for
another
excellent
beer
d
very
sessionable
beer
at
this
abv
a
nice
drinker
all
around
should
be
called
dead
guy
lager
seeing
as
maibock
is
actually
a
lager
style
beer
oh
well
it
is
an
interesting
american
twist
on
a
traditional
german
style
that
comes
off
quite
well
a
lot
more
hop
aroma
and
flavour
than
a
traditional
maibock
and
a
little
more
bitterness
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
even
on
dead
guys
good
nights
i
dont
want
more
than
one
or
anxiously
anticipate
the
next
time
i
might
pop
one
yet
it
is
enjoyable
now
and
then
drinkability
very
drinkable
moderate
abv
strong
flavor
profile
and
a
good
balance
of
flavors
could
easily
session
this
beer
a
nice
american
example
of
the
maibockhelles
bock
style
dead
guy
ale
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
smells
distinctly
of
fruit
spices
and
cloves
you
can
definitely
taste
fruit
and
then
cloves
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
something
very
sweet
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
bite
drinkability
is
like
water
this
stuff
goes
down
nice
and
easy
d
same
as
mouth
overall
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
its
certainly
well
crafted
im
glad
that
i
chose
to
go
back
to
this
one
its
an
interesting
experience
to
drink
this
again
because
i
thought
i
could
remember
exactly
how
it
tasted
back
when
i
first
had
it
and
this
tastes
nothing
at
all
alike
its
a
fun
exercise
in
looking
at
your
palate
i
dunno
if
ill
reach
for
this
again
but
it
does
give
me
incentive
to
try
and
search
out
double
dead
guy
cheers
d
tastes
good
easy
drinking
beer
with
mild
complexities
drinkability
is
great
very
easy
on
the
tastebuds
theres
just
enough
hints
of
hoppiness
here
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
perfect
segue
for
those
that
are
wanting
to
get
into
craft
beers
overall
im
very
glad
i
was
turned
to
this
drink
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
and
give
as
gifts
had
on
tap
at
burger
jones
in
uptown
it
came
in
a
pint
glass
and
had
a
cloudy
orange
color
to
it
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
smell
was
hops
and
pine
and
malt
it
looked
like
an
ipa
the
taste
was
very
good
it
was
a
great
hop
hit
with
some
sweet
malts
it
was
very
fresh
and
sweet
tasting
with
a
toasty
malty
earthy
sweet
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
creamy
this
is
one
great
ale
that
i
will
have
again
soon
im
very
impressed
with
it
quite
tasty
and
recommended
i
hadnt
had
dead
guy
ale
in
a
while
so
i
decided
to
be
crazy
and
buy
a
six
pack
i
forgot
how
good
this
beer
is
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
not
a
huge
head
but
plenty
there
its
got
a
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
smell
not
a
whole
lot
of
hops
in
the
nose
but
plenty
of
malt
it
tastes
really
good
definitely
high
on
the
malt
and
little
more
subdues
with
the
hops
the
taste
starts
off
slightly
sweet
caramel
but
gives
way
to
spice
and
bitterness
a
lot
happening
there
and
it
all
comes
together
beautifully
medium
mouthfeel
nice
and
clean
very
drinkable
im
glad
i
decided
to
pick
up
this
six
pack
i
dont
remember
liking
this
beer
as
much
the
last
time
i
had
it
drinkability
a
very
tasty
eminently
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
true
to
class
exceptional
d
this
is
very
drinkable
only
drawback
i
see
is
the
hi
price
i
dont
think
its
as
good
as
the
price
reflects
d
could
drink
this
one
all
day
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
certainly
drink
it
its
great
balance
is
what
sets
it
apart
not
too
hoppy
or
malty
but
very
much
both
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
it
was
a
nice
surprise
looked
great
hazy
orange
with
a
soft
head
the
nose
is
a
little
out
there
in
a
good
way
that
mishmash
of
hops
and
malt
is
pretty
distinctive
a
touch
of
stone
fruits
in
there
with
the
soft
buttery
malt
on
the
palate
its
loads
of
fun
with
all
that
coming
together
nicely
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
at
the
finish
a
good
smooth
ale
that
id
be
happy
to
come
back
to
if
i
could
pay
the
same
price
as
the
americans
for
it
d
very
drinkable
beer
my
first
rogue
beer
and
its
a
damn
good
start
for
me
id
say
this
is
a
beer
you
could
definitely
come
back
to
time
and
time
again
deasy
to
drink
i
could
definately
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkability
damn
good
one
of
my
favorites
and
something
i
will
come
back
to
time
and
time
again
try
this
beer
as
soon
as
you
can
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
foood
as
a
thirst
quencher
as
a
substitute
for
a
meal
this
beer
will
do
it
the
flavor
is
interesting
enough
not
to
get
boring
blipped
stone
dead
forever
by
motorhead
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
very
drinkable
mostly
because
it
is
very
balanced
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
somewhere
near
the
middle
i
recommend
at
least
one
try
of
this
beer
its
a
beer
i
could
definitely
session
with
goes
nice
with
an
italian
dressing
covered
sub
cheers
overall
first
brew
from
the
guys
at
rogue
and
i
must
say
its
definitely
a
win
its
got
just
enough
of
everything
to
make
it
complex
with
a
purpose
d
super
easy
to
drink
and
quite
pleasurable
a
great
beer
for
any
occasion
overall
a
good
balanced
sessionable
beer
d
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
too
much
to
be
a
session
beer
imo
d
not
bad
at
all
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
imo
could
session
with
it
easily
will
buy
again
d
its
a
special
beer
for
sure
but
im
not
sure
i
will
drink
this
one
again
the
huge
amount
of
honey
or
syrup
makes
it
very
sweet
it
was
a
treat
to
have
this
beer
on
tap
ive
always
enjoyed
it
bottled
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
given
a
5
for
drinkability
and
the
best
helles
ive
had
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
could
suck
a
few
down
d
very
drinkable
balanced
brew
with
enough
of
everything
to
please
almost
any
drinker
d
only
having
a
22oz
something
for
the
cooler
months
will
reconsider
when
frost
hits
i
could
have
this
beer
frequently
and
not
be
wanting
for
more
very
drinkable
in
all
drinkability
this
isnt
for
a
novice
beer
drinker
who
constantly
drinks
lager
i
enjoyed
this
beer
though
not
all
of
the
time
im
glad
i
tried
it
d
finished
a
pint
of
this
beer
pretty
quickly
and
was
ready
for
another
i
dont
think
many
people
are
going
to
struggle
with
drinking
a
couple
of
these
d
easy
to
finish
but
the
price
is
too
high
to
revisit
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
the
taste
is
a
slightly
sweet
toasty
bread
very
slightly
bitter
combination
that
is
very
pleasant
the
amount
of
carbonation
is
nearly
perfect
and
complements
the
taste
giving
the
overall
mouthfeel
that
i
like
in
a
beer
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
i
only
wish
it
was
more
available
in
my
area
an
easy
to
drink
sessionable
beer
while
the
flavor
isnt
the
most
complex
i
thought
there
was
a
decent
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
d
great
price
tons
of
flavor
the
bitterness
and
heavy
feel
are
keeping
this
from
a
perfect
5
i
would
buy
this
again
this
might
be
a
great
beer
to
convert
macro
drinkers
very
drinkable
and
all
that
but
its
got
a
bit
of
a
cloying
sweetness
that
stays
with
you
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
id
go
for
something
else
that
rogue
brews
personally
d
nothign
too
complex
lighter
and
refreshing
6
5
is
probably
on
the
border
of
session
drinkable
this
is
very
drinkable
as
it
is
a
balanced
beer
verdict
dead
guy
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
character
but
falls
short
of
being
exceptional
a
worthy
flagship
brew
for
one
of
the
bigger
american
microbreweries
d
definitely
an
easy
beer
to
drink
one
of
my
personal
favorites
to
drink
too
served
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
malt
upfront
in
the
aroma
sweet
a
little
caramel
big
malt
taste
little
bit
of
caramel
alcohol
i
thought
was
a
little
noticeable
mediumbodied
very
good
beer
poured
12oz
out
of
bottle
into
rogue
pint
glass
amber
in
color
i
didnt
remember
what
it
smelled
like
but
the
one
i
poured
had
almost
no
aroma
at
all
smooth
mouthfeel
moderately
hopped
a
great
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
still
love
this
beer
d
overall
a
solid
beer
to
me
this
is
much
more
balanced
and
drinkable
than
traditional
bocks
that
focus
more
heavily
on
malt
depth
which
results
in
a
really
sweet
syrupy
brew
id
drink
this
again
i
now
realize
what
this
beer
reminds
me
of
magic
hat
9
this
has
a
little
more
zing
to
it
it
is
still
a
good
beer
just
not
as
spectacular
as
i
remember
cheers
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
most
enjoyable
a
really
clean
and
lovely
beer
to
start
the
day
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
light
carbonation
immensely
drinkable
on
the
whole
im
having
a
difficult
time
finding
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
but
the
fact
that
i
cant
seem
to
come
up
with
anything
particularly
negative
seems
to
say
a
lot
its
not
special
but
there
are
no
serious
flaws
that
i
can
find
mouthfeel
nicely
full
and
rich
almost
chewy
towards
the
end
a
little
bit
intense
on
the
mid
overall
but
thats
otherwise
a
very
pleasant
beer
good
drinkability
still
have
that
curious
tingle
on
my
tongue
but
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
is
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
drinkability
very
good
finally
a
rogue
beer
that
isnt
an
overhopped
nightmare
i
can
see
me
getting
more
of
these
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
bubbly
white
film
on
top
a
beautiful
silky
lace
permeates
the
glass
with
each
sip
the
smell
consists
of
flowery
hops
light
malts
and
alcohol
sweet
and
yeasty
aromas
become
apparent
taste
is
fruity
and
zesty
hops
balanced
with
a
dryly
malted
aftertaste
theres
a
peppery
hop
spiciness
that
nicely
compliments
the
malty
flavours
and
floral
aromas
lots
of
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
velvety
upfront
perfectly
bitter
and
dry
in
the
finish
well
balanced
another
fine
ale
from
rogue
with
more
of
a
malt
profile
than
most
of
their
beers
the
tangy
flavours
would
pair
well
with
spicy
food
or
creamy
dishes
like
clam
chowder
d
good
beer
lives
up
to
the
rogue
standards
one
of
the
better
ales
ive
had
dgood
beer
definitely
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
both
complex
and
easydrinking
a
fine
ale
for
those
seeking
an
alternative
to
the
hopbomb
second
bottle
during
a
second
tasting
session
the
alcohol
is
less
present
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
the
exact
same
color
as
my
hair
and
beard
other
than
that
its
sort
of
a
typical
light
bock
has
a
clean
finish
a
bit
buttery
and
has
a
caramel
presence
a
bit
bready
pale
malt
a
bit
of
hop
is
in
there
a
bit
filling
but
it
is
a
bock
so
thats
to
be
expected
not
much
aroma
from
the
glass
mouh
is
fullbodied
good
not
great
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
my
own
but
ill
drink
it
above
other
stuff
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
and
one
ive
wanted
to
try
for
a
long
time
it
was
worth
the
wait
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
it
has
a
good
taste
and
is
very
easy
going
down
i
would
but
this
agian
for
sure
but
the
dead
guy
is
the
one
i
think
that
it
is
the
best
beer
to
give
to
you
up
and
coming
beer
buddies
to
educate
them
on
a
bock
style
beer
i
have
many
friends
that
are
growing
into
the
craft
beer
scene
and
i
think
that
this
is
after
you
get
them
into
pales
and
ambers
the
best
way
to
get
people
to
the
next
level
from
the
bottle
pours
a
really
nice
clear
orange
color
with
a
nice
big
white
head
head
has
pretty
good
retention
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
hoppy
kind
of
sweet
as
well
not
much
else
to
the
smell
taste
is
kind
of
hoppy
some
caramel
taste
come
through
as
well
its
pretty
sweet
as
well
not
to
much
bitterness
definitely
a
great
taste
this
is
one
ive
been
a
fan
of
since
the
first
time
i
had
it
when
i
was
first
getting
into
drinking
beer
and
i
still
love
it
and
pick
it
up
quite
often
today
a
great
offering
from
rogue
and
one
everyone
should
try
overall
a
decent
brew
not
as
good
as
other
rogue
offerings
though
d
goes
down
nicely
could
easily
finish
off
a
few
love
the
bottle
and
the
name
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
d
this
one
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
a
few
of
in
a
session
i
would
love
to
have
it
with
a
more
delicate
cut
of
steak
such
as
new
york
strip
or
tenderloin
au
poivre
sauce
would
make
an
excellent
spicy
combination
with
the
mild
flavor
of
this
brew
overall
a
good
beer
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
but
its
not
bad
not
necessarily
my
style
but
it
is
enjoyable
except
for
the
fact
that
it
leaves
me
wanting
a
more
complex
hop
profile
d
heavier
than
other
maibocks
ive
had
but
not
at
all
cumbrous
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
for
quite
a
while
and
happened
upon
a
6
pack
good
beer
my
second
from
rogue
from
the
bottle
of
a
barrelperched
skeleton
pours
this
pnw
maibock
based
on
the
pour
it
looks
medium
bodied
the
honey
amber
hue
is
slightly
translucent
with
microbubbles
of
co2
effervescing
from
the
bottom
ivory
head
holds
up
fairly
well
before
lacing
the
walls
taste
is
of
clean
sweet
cereal
grains
kinda
like
golden
grahams
malt
is
sturdy
i
get
a
sense
of
perfume
and
citrus
from
the
hops
not
necessarily
on
the
tastebuds
but
swirling
around
the
sides
and
roof
of
my
mouth
medium
mouthfeel
sweet
finish
a
very
civil
interaction
between
malt
and
hop
with
the
grain
taking
the
top
billing
good
brew
hats
of
to
rogue
for
a
really
enjoyable
brew
good
brew
ive
had
both
tapped
and
bottled
love
the
tap
dont
like
the
bottle
good
luck
d
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
in
my
opinion
rogue
has
definitely
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
brew
that
is
sessionable
good
malt
flavor
and
nice
balance
pours
a
transparent
rustic
orangebrown
thin
head
little
retention
or
lacing
looks
to
be
short
on
carbonation
smells
almost
like
a
thin
brown
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
bitter
nuttiness
behind
it
taste
is
similar
tastes
like
a
clean
lager
but
with
a
bit
of
a
nuttiness
slightly
bitter
finish
a
bit
of
pizazz
flourish
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
low
and
watery
could
use
more
carbonation
i
think
tastes
kind
of
flat
decently
drinkable
overall
nothing
spectacular
kind
of
expensive
for
a
session
beer
dangerously
drinkable
at
this
abv
mfd
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
paired
extremely
well
with
some
spicy
pepperjack
cheese
and
water
crackers
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
pound
this
back
all
night
actually
i
would
love
to
pound
this
back
all
night
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
im
three
for
three
for
rogue
this
is
a
great
brewery
d
pretty
drinkable
id
say
goes
down
smooth
and
not
too
high
of
an
abv
to
be
a
deterrent
from
drinking
another
notes
it
is
remarkable
how
much
my
smelltaste
has
changed
in
the
past
18
months
as
i
think
about
this
beer
and
strain
to
recall
what
it
tastedsmelled
like
then
anyway
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
from
rogue
d
absolutely
you
could
session
with
this
beer
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
easy
to
find
and
even
easier
to
drink
d
highly
drinkable
beer
overall
id
buy
it
again
but
far
from
one
of
my
favorites
good
beer
but
i
dont
see
what
the
big
deal
is
about
this
beer
nothing
would
have
me
crawling
back
to
it
just
a
good
refresher
along
side
your
meal
drinkability
is
the
strong
point
of
this
beer
hot
day
today
im
already
wishing
i
had
another
of
this
delicious
and
wonderful
brew
will
definitely
get
again
highly
drinkable
and
very
balanced
spicy
hops
and
malty
as
well
overall
a
very
nice
beer
it
pours

brews
im
brewin
ideas
notes
this
is
a
well
put
together
beer
and
it
is
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
rogue
product
but
this
style
is
not
for
me
but
it
is
still
a
quality
beer
drinkabilityoverall
pretty
smooth
definitely
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
everywhere
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
an
excellent
warm
weather
beer
not
a
session
beer
a
little
too
much
abv
here
for
that
but
an
great
brew
nonetheless
a
must
try
side
note
whats
w
the
name
i
though
a
maibock
was
a
lager
not
an
alewtf
suprised
when
i
saw
rogue
at
a
mediocre
distributer
in
philadelphia
poured
into
bottle
honeyamber
color
thin
offwhite
head
smells
caramel
strong
but
not
overwhelming
malty
taste
smooth
and
refreshing
on
my
second
now
dont
think
ill
go
for
three
but
definately
will
drink
again
one
of
my
favorites
along
wthe
double
dead
guy
from
rogue
d
very
tasty
beer
enjoyed
it
very
much
the
flavors
from
the
malt
are
extraordinary
and
the
hops
add
a
great
balance
of
bitterness
solid
beer
would
drink
again
poured
an
amber
honey
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
died
down
pretty
quick
sweet
toasted
malt
and
flowery
hop
aromas
a
big
malt
flavor
sweet
and
toasted
followed
by
some
grassy
hop
flavor
and
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
also
could
detect
a
little
alcohol
every
other
sip
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
pours
light
amber
with
some
gold
colour
white
head
and
nose
is
very
faint
disappointing
palate
offers
the
traditional
maibock
malt
forwardness
but
it
is
somewhat
fruity
sweet
and
lacks
the
alcohol
warmth
that
is
a
regular
component
of
the
maibock
experience
very
drinkable
this
was
a
surprise
beer
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
what
i
thought
was
mocha
porter
and
poured
it
obviously
wasnt
a
porter
bonus
beer
anyhow
i
poured
into
a
cleveland
browns
bud
light
nonic
to
a
half
inch
a
white
head
it
is
copper
in
color
and
smells
spicy
and
bready
the
taste
was
spicy
at
first
but
became
sweet
the
hops
were
appearant
on
the
back
end
i
have
not
had
this
beer
in
a
while
but
it
was
not
bad
considering
i
was
expecting
a
porter
i
guess
i
should
have
looked
at
the
bottle
instead
of
bullshitting
oh
well
a
pleasant
bonus
overall
i
would
say
it
is
a
unique
brew
i
like
it
but
for
12
bucks
i
will
get
something
else
one
thing
is
it
is
quite
potent
so
take
it
easy
if
you
dare
to
be
a
dead
guy
drinkability
meh
its
not
the
best
tasting
beer
that
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
awful
in
terms
of
driniability
im
sure
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
the
price
is
moderate
after
drinking
this
beer
miller
lite
tastes
like
a
guinness
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
that
i
have
had
it
is
almost
like
someone
took
a
barrel
full
of
hops
and
mixed
it
with
a
glass
of
sugar
water
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
distastful
things
that
you
could
do
with
water
sugar
and
hops
please
stop
supporting
their
efforts
in
wasting
our
fresh
water
supply
d
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
i
can
drink
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
that
is
the
max
i
will
definitely
drink
again
drinakbility
i
have
worked
my
way
through
a
six
pack
over
the
course
of
a
couple
weeks
and
overall
i
have
not
really
come
to
love
this
beer
it
seems
way
too
expensive
for
the
quality
of
beer
for
some
reason
it
is
also
a
sipper
which
is
a
surprise
at
its
6
5
alcohol
d
very
drinkable
due
to
the
6
5
abv
ample
carbonation
and
crisp
eversoslightly
bitter
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
sure
id
want
to
session
it
but
maybe
i
was
expecting
it
to
deliver
something
that
it
didnt
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
it
first
either
overall
this
would
probably
appeal
to
some
people
but
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
a
great
beer
that
doesnt
try
too
hard
no
huge
dominant
flavors
but
everything
is
done
well
this
is
a
good
beer
not
daring
nothing
really
stands
out
other
than
it
is
made
well
good
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
what
makes
it
good
an
appealing
to
many
also
keeps
it
just
a
good
beer
nothing
wrong
with
a
good
beer
though
d
an
ok
brew
that
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
pretty
good
none
the
less
notes
ive
had
rogue
dead
guy
numerous
times
before
this
review
but
as
the
month
of
april
begins
to
close
i
thought
what
better
a
time
to
review
a
maibock
than
a
beautiful
spring
day
this
is
one
wonderfully
light
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
and
it
suits
the
warmer
months
well
rogue
dead
guy
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
and
while
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
with
intense
flavor
which
it
isnt
supposed
to
do
sometimes
its
nice
to
have
something
light
it
will
definitely
make
you
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
of
the
rogue
brewers
and
the
gentle
pleasantness
of
this
beer
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
if
you
are
not
a
hop
head
but
want
to
know
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
it
gives
you
a
malty
sweetness
to
balance
a
bitterness
you
may
not
be
used
to
pours

hazy
murky
deep

roasted

slightly

and
light

finish
lasting
a
good

mediumbodied
and
well
balanced
beer
definite
malty
caramel
flavor
not
very
hoppy
to
me
even
in
finish
good
malted
beer
cheers
mouthfeel
is
a
little
strong
but
is
quite
evenly
manageable
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
as
well
overall
ill
be
adding
more
to
the
collection
d
very
drinkable
you
can
kick
these
around
all
day
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
marketing
for
it
the
name
sucks
you
in
as
for
the
beer
the
appearance
is
a
caramel
brown
it
smells
strong
of
malt
i
tasted
it
out
of
the
bottle
and
was
bitter
so
i
poured
it
into
an
ayinger
glass
and
it
relieved
much
of
the
bitterness
if
you
like
very
malty
tasting
beer
this
is
probably
right
up
you
alley
drinkability
not
the
most
complex
for
the
style
but
a
delicious
brew
i
could
have
a
six
and
be
very
happy
i
will
search
for
this
again
get
this
on
tap
if
you
can
the
bottle
does
not
do
it
justice
i
will
bypass
all
other
beers
if
i
see
this
d
the
dead
guy
could
be
put
on
a
pedistal
for
other
session
beers
to
look
up
to
had
at
marathon
grill
in
philly
poured
an
amber
brown
with
thin
white
head
with
almost
no
retention
smelled
malty
and
sweet
with
some
hop
notes
and
also
vague
hints
of
molasses
and
lemon
taste
was
fairly
light
much
lighter
than
i
expected
watery
like
seltzer
at
first
then
moved
onto
that
molasseslemon
taste
probably
form
the
yeast
i
once
used
a
particular
yeast
in
some
homebrew
that
gave
a
similar
taste
sweet
at
first
then
sharp
with
a
faint
hoppy
finish
very
wet
feel
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
nothing
too
special
t
the
perfect
contrast
of
bitter
hops
drifting
along
a
blanket
of
smoothness
sugary
sweetness
flirts
on
the
tip
and
edges
of
the
tongue
strong
in
your
face
flavor
the
sweetness
radiates
a
fruitiness
throughout
the
beginning
and
mid
until
it
slowly
warms
into
caramel
which
dissipates
leaving
just
that
lingering
backofthemouth
hoppy
bitterness
d
strangely
something
about
this
beer
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
of
lots
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
make
this
brew
rather
rich
certainly
an
improvement
ontap
however
it
tastes
bitter
and
tangy
the
is
a
nice
caramel
influence
some
iced
tea
a
little
bit
of
floral
notes
from
the
hops
the
hops
become
more
assertive
as
it
warms
half
way
through
there
is
a
definite
floralearthy
taste
yummy
this
beer
is
relatively
subdued
yet
delicious
with
a
chewy
velvety
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
very
drinkable
md
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
great
very
creamy
and
smooth
i
could
go
for
a
few
of
these
another
good
product
of
rogue
next
in
line
double
dead
guy
ale
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
brew
with
quaffability
maibocks
are
pretty
decent
session
brews
in
my
opinion
and
this
one
is
certainly
no
exception
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
a
grillout
on
a
summer
weekend
highly
recommended
all
around
not
a
bad
brew
d
i
could
take
a
few
of
these
down
d
flavorful
and
full
bodied
with
a
nice
malty
character
reasonably
drinkable
but
the
heavy
malt
gets
old
after
a
couple
of
pints
have
had
this
a
couple
times
and
each
time
i
have
it
i
feel
like
the
drinkability
goes
down
pours
a
lighter
amberdark
orange
color
with
a
fairly
small
white
head
it
smells
sweet
and
malty
it
is
pretty
smooth
and
tastes
of
malts
also
a
little
bit
of
sweet
bitterness
there
is
something
weird
in
the
taste
that
i
seem
to
dislike
more
every
time
i
have
this
it
is
not
bad
at
all
just
changing
my
original
reaction
it
is
drinkable
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
a
night
still
a
very
good
beer
a
lot
of
people
praise
this
highly
drinkability
definitely
a
good
beer
and
an
easy
drinker
not
as
complex
or
hoppy
as
i
usually
like
but
a
good
solid
beer
sorry
if
the
review
is
too
gushy
but
im
reviewing
as
im
tasting
hey
dont
judge
its
a
fun
way
to
procrastinate
studying
good
beer
it
was
the
special
that
night
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
and
i
dont
regret
it
probably
reach
for
this
again
sometime
dead
guy
is
the
first
rogue
beer
i
ever
drank
and
it
still
one
of
my
standbys
red
in
color
1
finger
off
white
head
some
lacing
smells
of
spicy
hops
tastes
fairly
hoppy
but
not
like
a
ipa
thin
to
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
little
too
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
i
have
drank
my
fair
share
in
a
sitting
note
this
beer
definitely
benefits
from
the
proper
glassware
i
enjoy
dead
guy
much
more
from
the
pilsner
over
a
standard
pint
an
excellently
balanced
beer
that
ive
had
my
share
of
and
will
return
to
again
and
again
a
great
session
beer
overall
very
enjoyable
a
drinkable
brew
thats
tasty
and
interesting
the
abv
is
a
little
high
to
be
a
session
beer
but
this
is
definitely
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
recommended
overall
a
great
flavorful
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
that
isnt
too
filling
i
loved
it
d
very
drinkable
drinkability
ranks
high
you
could
easily
session
this
overall
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
to
bring
to
a
party
or
maybe
even
a
case
great
brew
went
down
well
id
certainly
have
another
medium
body
with
a
light
to
medium
carbonation
level
i
could
see
drinking
maybe
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
i
didnt
feel
like
i
would
want
to
drink
this
all
night
long
for
some
reason
ive
never
been
blown
away
by
dead
guy
like
some
people
are
but
this
is
still
pretty
solid
stuff
for
my
tastes
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
to
drink
by
itself
but
it
does
seem
to
pair
well
with
some
spicy
foods
so
theres
definitely
certain
occasions
where
this
would
be
more
drinkable
for
me
poured
a
medium
amber
body
with
great
lacing
and
a
pure
cloudy
unfiltered
appearance
on
the
nose
it
is
tremendously
pleasing
with
a
great
deal
of
malts
and
roasted
grains
with
a
sweet
honey
fruit
scent
backed
by
a
serious
balance
of
sweet
and
savory
the
taste
delivered
what
the
smell
promised
very
balanced
with
a
great
deal
of
malt
and
a
sweet
earthy
molasses
fruit
well
balanced
through
the
finish
even
with
the
alcohol
present
on
the
palate
with
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
full
body
a
great
early
spring
when
it
is
still
chilly
out
or
fall
beer
rogue
continues
to
deliver
im
not
huge
into
rogue
but
they
always
seem
to
deliver
the
goods
makes
me
want
to
try
others
from
this
style
and
i
will
drink
this
again
d
notes
a
fine
tasting
lager
that
is
surely
a
good
crossover
beer
it
is
not
too
heavy
so
it
can
be
drinkin
often
and
it
goes
really
well
with
pizza
unfortunately
my
scores
might
be
a
bit
low
because
im
hedging
my
bets
to
allow
myself
some
wiggle
room
on
future
beer
reviews
i
cant
just
give
this
thing
an
easy
a
having
only
one
other
review
under
my
ba
belt
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way

pours
dark
copper
and
has
a
wonderful
sweet
malty
flavor
thats
quickly
followed
by
a
strong
west
coast
hop
bite
im
not
sure
that
it
exactly
follows
the
guidelines
for
a
maibock
but
i
do
know
that
its
quite
delicious
and
pairs
excellently
with
pizza
its
a
little
late
when
i
got
home
so
i
dont
know
how
many
ill
finish
but
i
know
i
wont
switch
over
and
i
will
be
drinking
these
puppies
until
i
go
to
sleep
at
least
three
maybe
four
drinkable
for
sure
as
for
the
high
marks
well
i
liked
it
what
should
i
have
done
deceptively
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
is
smooth
and
mild
yet
still
has
a
nice
hop
ending
the
beer
to
me
is
a
good
transition
beer
one
thats
a
good
gateway
beer
to
superior
craft
beer
probably
why
there
are
over
1200
reviews
cheers
prosit
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
but
the
only
problem
is
that
the
taste
gets
old
once
i
get
about
halfway
through
with
the
glass
its
a
good
brew
definitely
not
a
real
bock
but
it
just
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
as
much
as
others
d
a
nice
little
ale
from
rogue
not
a
true
maibock
but
a
nice
hybrid
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
stuff
thats
out
there
could
buy
again
good
brew
indeed
bought
a
bomber
a
while
back
and
cracked
it
after
a
long
day
and
a
nice
shower
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
almost
looks
like
a
dark
rich
honey
there
is
a
white
medium
sized
head
that
forms
and
soon
dissipates
to
a
white
film
zero
lacing
is
left
on
my
glass
and
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
works
its
way
up
to
the
top
the
aroma
is
nice
easily
detected
but
not
too
strong
which
primarily
consists
of
delectable
sweet
malts
very
pleasant
and
appealing
the
scent
lured
me
into
a
balanced
flavor
of
sweet
malts
i
was
expecting
something
over
the
top
but
this
beer
was
simple
and
delivered
perhaps
perfecting
a
recipe
that
relies
on
a
sturdy
malt
characteristic
only
is
what
makes
this
ale
so
good
creamy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
full
and
finishes
slightly
dry
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
simply
for
what
it
does
right
drinkability
could
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
not
my
first
choice
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
pours
a
clean
orange
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
buscuity
malt
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
and
small
grapefruity
hop
a
bitter
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
semi
dry
and
small
hop
aftertaste
quite
like
an
ipa
small
bite
and
good
this
beer
will
never
disappoint
it
is
fullflavored
hearty
and
wellrounded
i
think
ill
have
another
amber
colored
brew
with
an
off
white
fluffy
head
some
lacing
but
minimal
smells
of
sweet
carmallized
malt
a
touch
of
honey
as
well
as
hints
of
spicey
hop
and
overripe
citrus
taste
is
very
sweet
carmelled
malt
with
hints
of
the
citrus
i
smelled
and
a
slight
bitter
hop
finish
overall
it
has
a
medium
mouth
feel
with
light
carbonation
and
allthough
the
scales
are
tipped
pretty
far
to
the
malt
side
of
things
it
still
comes
off
as
very
drinkable
d
a
fine
maibock
with
good
hops
character
highly
recommended
d
superior
drinkability
this
is
a
great
anytime
beer
very
pleased
i
ordered
one
d
definitely
drinkable
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
in
any
rogue
that
ive
had
thus
far
i
will
say
im
not
a
big
fan
of
paying
5
50
for
the
bomber
but
this
brew
is
worth
it
you
get
the
picture
a
fine
beer
but
not
an
exciting
beer
poured
a
light
amber
but
not
translucent
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
a
light
hoppiness
aroma
well
balanced
the
taste
was
of
hops
well
balanced
not
to
bitter
and
a
caught
of
hint
of
caramel
it
had
an
excellent
texture
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
sitting
outside
and
i
had
a
number
of
them
i
didnt
think
it
was
to
heavy
and
recommend
it
as
a
session
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
pairs
well
with
pasta
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
bock
i
wouldve
simply
thought
it
was
a
maltier
attempt
at
an
apa
highly
drinkable
serving
type
tap
blown
away
by
this
beer
and
its
complexity
d
very
high
great
brew
for
spicy
chinese
take
out
orange
colored
ale
with
a
fading
head
that
stays
as
a
thin
film
on
top
aroma
is
some
kind
of
fruit
taste
is
citruscaramel
and
bread
i
was
worried
that
this
was
going
to
be
another
overhyped
ale
but
it
wasntprobably
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
ales
ive
ever
had
good
flavor
from
first
to
last
sip
i
highly
recommend
and
will
purchase
again
shortly
drinkability
dont
know
if
this
is
a
beer
i
would
like
to
drink
alot
of
at
one
time
but
i
think
paring
with
ceratin
foods
or
enjoying
on
a
hot
sunny
day
yes
pours
an
ambercopper
that
leaves
a
two
fingered
soapy
head
as
the
head
disipatates
it
leaves
behind
sticky
lacing
that
clings
then
dries
and
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
dried
fruits
earthy
hops
and
caramel
come
through
as
well
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
strong
malty
caramel
upfront
that
dominates
and
an
earthness
of
hops
and
dried
fruit
its
not
too
bitter
nor
its
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
slickthick
and
creamy
dead
guy
ale
is
good
to
the
last
drop
as
it
warms
the
flavors
are
more
pronounced
i
cant
believe
the
abv
is
6
5
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
smooth
recommended
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
buy
more
of
these
pours
medium
honey
color
with
thick
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
kind
of
quickly
leaving
a
thin
flim
and
spidery
lace
malty
aroma
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
grassy
maybe
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
as
well
malty
if
that
has
a
honey
flavor
picks
up
a
nicely
balanced
bitterness
for
the
finish
very
tasty
medium
bodied
with
a
pleasant
almost
light
syrup
finish
very
drinkable
any
time
of
year
excellent
beer
overall
a
good
beer
i
will
buy
this
one
again
i
am
not
sure
i
what
i
expected
from
this
one
as
it
was
a
gift
and
i
specifically
chose
not
to
read
up
on
it
prior
drinkability
snappy
and
tasty
rather
refreshing
while
being
full
of
flavor
i
approve
another
well
crafted
and
balanced
beer
from
rogue
tastes
of
pale
malts
a
little
sweet
the
fruitiness
is
not
as
evident
as
i
assumed
it
would
be
after
smelling
the
beer
finishes
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
orange
body
and
a
compact
offwhite
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
fruity
bready
aroma
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
holy
malt
batman
fruit
and
caramel
malt
transitioning
through
to
honey
baked
bread
with
a
flowery
hoppy
finish
surprising
warmth
from
the
alcohol
full
slick
perfectly
balanced
mouthfeel
with
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
huge
drinkability
and
im
already
planning
on
taking
a
sixer
to
the
july
4th
bbq
i
like
everything
about
this
brew
a
for
the
folks
at
rogue
a
nice
drinking
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
more
ontap
than
in
the
bottle
d
hows
your
wallet
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
maltforward
beer
with
lets
face
it
one
of
the
coolest
names
and
labels
out
there
overall
a
good
brew
that
will
cut
through
meat
dishes
with
ease
and
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
the
year
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
serviceable
nonetheless
none
of
this
is
to
suggest
that
this
isnt
a
beer
which
goes
down
smooth
wet
and
slippery
in
the
mouth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
alive
its
intoxicatingly
drinkable
for
something
so
hoppy
and
bock
like
perfect
for
when
you
need
or
want
something
to
fall
back
to
thanks
again
rogue
youve
sure
created
a
classic
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
a
little
rough
in
the
mouth
and
sticky
in
the
throat
it
leaves
a
mild
coating
that
can
be
distracting
its
a
decent
anytime
beer
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
perfect
yearround
ale
that
is
also
food
friendlybe
it
burgers
ribs
or
fish
i
would
take
a
6
pack
or
12
of
these
over
any
ab
product
any
day
this
just
tastes
good
i
cant
pinpoint
all
the
flavors
yet
but
its
very
very
flavorful
a
good
malty
aftertaste
for
me
this
is
probly
the
first
beer
i
have
that
i
could
easily
just
grab
a
6
pack
and
be
good
on
just
this
props
to
rogue
for
making
a
flavorful
beer
i
will
be
trying
all
of
there
other
styles
i
prefer
a
fuller
bodied
beer
but
the
6
5
abv
did
the
trick
on
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
a
steal
at
the
price
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
it
did
not
blow
me
away
but
drinkable
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
mug
it
produced
a
hazy
looked
like
apple
cider
appearance
with
a
white
thick
head
that
dissolved
fairly
quick
the
aroma
was
malt
with
a
health
hint
of
apple
the
taste
was
unique
the
apple
really
came
out
which
provided
some
sweetness
along
with
a
nice
malt
and
hop
combination
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
that
i
will
have
to
keep
in
stock
but
something
that
i
will
pick
up
from
time
to
time
m
d
lighter
without
much
for
carbonation
kinda
lopsided
in
balance
between
those
easy
to
drink
perhaps
not
as
intriguing
as
german
brews
of
the
style
but
a
decent
drink
nonetheless
shiny
copper
with
a
bit
of
murk
in
color
and
a
moderate
head
that
hangs
tight
for
a
minute
or
two
before
vanishing
a
very
scrumptious
malty
nutty
and
caramel
aroma
a
sweet
and
creamy
toasty
malt
thing
is
the
first
thing
noticed
in
the
taste
not
too
sweet
though
because
a
hop
bitterness
balances
it
out
neither
dominate
the
flavor
but
compliment
each
other
in
a
nice
complexity
the
caramel
nuances
dont
take
away
from
the
hop
bite
nor
from
the
malt
roast
but
add
the
the
overall
flavor
a
great
blend
that
leaves
a
slightly
dry
but
mostly
soothing
feeling
in
the
throat
this
beer
has
flavor
and
drinkability
definitely
easy
to
kick
back
and
have
a
few
of
these
dyes
this
is
drinkable
however
i
was
looking
for
something
different
i
think
ill
start
drinking
and
reviewing
a
beer
twice
before
writing
a
review
beer
is
a
coppery
color
with
a
thin
soapy
head
that
dissipates
to
lacy
bubbles
quickly
smell
is
pleasant
hops
and
malt
combine
for
a
very
tart
green
apple
nose
hops
are
ever
present
in
this
beer
but
less
aggressive
than
most
rogue
beers
medium
malt
flavor
with
an
herbal
taste
of
tea
and
caramel
that
tasted
great
but
really
needed
more
presence
in
this
beer
decent
wellbalanced
beer
from
rogue
d
light
refreshing
and
pleasant
just
what
i
needed
in
this
80
degree
weather
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
overall
very
nice
would
recommend
side
note
if
you
have
not
tried
the
sweetwater
ipa
i
would
highly
recommend
searching
it
out
if
youre
in
the
southeast
fantastic
hops
youll
swear
they
squeeze
a
grapefruit
in
every
bottle
drinkability
is
ok
but
even
this
much
richer
draught
version
still
isnt
really
my
cup
of
tea
just
a
bit
to
thick
i
still
think
this
one
is
lacking
the
crispness
of
a
lager
yeast
that
a
bock
mandates
d
i
like
that
this
is
a
lighter
bock
and
is
one
complex
beer
that
doesnt
crush
you
with
the
malts
well
done
by
rogue
d
i
picked
up
this
beer
after
reading
plenty
of
articles
about
it
although
not
a
big
maibock
fan
or
even
well
versed
in
this
particular
style
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
easy
to
consume
and
enjoyable
a
beautiful
looking
beer
that
went
down
well
and
tasted
great
i
am
definately
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
shot
and
would
certainly
get
this
again
d
good
i
like
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
have
to
pace
yourself
since
the
6
5
can
get
you
when
youre
not
looking
d
fairly
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
for
me
drinkability
very
good
would
make
a
fine
hoppy
session
beer
d
appropriately
for
a
maibock
sampled
in
may
fairly
complex
malt
with
a
nice
hop
touch
moderate
abv
for
the
style
and
structured
well
overall
very
drinkable
and
certainly
a
looker
i
like
it
just
a
tad
pricey
for
a
session
6
00
a
bomber
in
my
area
if
someone
else
picked
up
the
tab
id
drink
it
all
night
dthis
could
be
an
everyday
brew
for
me
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
however
so
are
many
other
amberstyle
beers
huge
props
for
going
the
different
route
and
brewing
a
maibock
instead
of
the
ubiquitous
amber
thats
the
flagship
of
so
many
us
breweries
however
the
price
point
doesnt
justify
this
beer
for
me
i
dont
mind
paying
more
for
a
bomber
of
the
superb
shakespeare
stout
brutal
bitter
or
many
others
but
its
harder
to
pay
the
rogue
premium
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
stand
out
much
among
a
crowd
of
worthy
ambers
that
run
nearly
50
less
price
is
usually
reflected
in
my
drinkability
score
and
certainly
is
for
this
beer
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
rogue
pours
with
a
pleasant
aroma
and
produces
a
nice
head
that
lasts
long
enough
but
doesnt
wear
out
its
welcome
distinct
bready
aroma
with
enough
malt
to
be
different
especially
noticeable
was
the
change
in
aroma
as
the
beer
got
warmer
the
breadiness
went
away
and
was
replaced
with
some
pleasant
apples
and
bananas
not
too
demanding
and
fizzy
enough
to
be
a
good
summer
beer
nice
all
around
would
definitely
try
others
from
rogue
pours
a
slighlty
hazy
med
goldcopper
color
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
nonic
not
a
strong
smell
bready
w
steely
cereal
grain
and
some
darker
malts
butter
and
dark
fruit
noted
as
well
a
sweet
malty
strong
tealike
flavor
with
hints
of
whole
grain
bread
caramel
and
raison
in
decent
balance
w
the
hop
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
minerally
finish
a
rich
med
body
w
a
moderate
amount
of
co2
a
very
drinkable
brew
esp
for
a
bock
my
only
regret
is
not
getting
more
i
can
safely
say
this
is
the
best
maibock
ive
tasted
d
while
i
do
like
this
beer
i
would
never
get
a
second
there
is
something
about
it
that
just
does
not
make
it
drinkable
to
me
dont
get
me
wrong
i
have
drank
a
ton
of
this
just
never
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
unless
i
was
already
drunk
poured
from
a
bomber
to
a
pilsner
glass
a
dark
honey
orange
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
quickly
settled
it
had
a
malty
sweet
aroma
and
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
hint
of
honey
with
its
medium
body
light
carbonation
and
crisp
finish
i
could
definately
drink
a
few
of
these
this
is
turning
into
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
has
plenty
of
taste
yet
its
still
drinkable
cant
beat
that
had
this
one
on
tap
at
tapwerks
in
oklahoma
city
notice
it
has
a
bit
more
bite
on
tap
reddish
orange
brew
bartender
filled
it
to
the
rim
so
theres
no
head
no
complaints
here
smells
hoppy
and
citrusy
with
a
slight
sweet
malt
essence
in
the
background
tastes
of
oranges
and
a
perfect
mix
of
hops
and
malts
with
some
florals
hiding
out
theres
a
bit
of
chalkiness
to
it
as
well
tasty
and
very
drinkable
this
one
always
leaves
me
satisfied
edit
just
drank
another
bottle
of
this
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
was
alot
more
drinkable
and
i
loved
the
flavor
the
second
time
around
first
off
most
people
thought
that
this
strong
beer
tasted
a
lot
less
like
a
typical
maibock
than
it
did
like
a
typical
ale
it
lacks
the
springy
flavor
of
most
maibocks
and
comes
across
with
a
heavy
good
flavor
that
said
most
people
enjoyed
it
though
less
than
one
might
expect
some
thought
it
was
bitter
and
just
a
touch
overpowering
especially
given
its
notparticularlyhigh
abv
pours
a
well
toasted
and
keenly
hazey
copper
with
just
a
few
highlights
of
golden
apple
yellow
great
thick
foam
with
a
little
lacing
just
above
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
great
toasty
malts
with
a
good
dollop
of
earthy
herbal
hops
maye
a
faint
hint
of
fruits
mixed
in
there
the
taste
is
an
upfront
toast
with
a
little
light
red
currant
jelly
just
tickling
the
outsides
of
the
tastebuds
the
middle
gives
a
good
herbal
hop
definiton
finishing
with
slightly
creamy
malts
and
a
more
earthy
hop
tone
very
clean
earthy
hop
palate
with
a
clean
malt
bill
very
good
beer
great
hoppy
maibock
this
beer
is
quite
malty
with
a
distinct
alcohol
tinge
to
it
and
a
hint
of
peach
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
im
partial
to
hoppy
ipas
so
maybe
not
the
guy
to
ask
about
drinkability
this
brew
has
an
amber
haze
but
is
without
floaties
a
good
drink
thats
bitter
and
a
slightly
flat
with
a
little
acid
prick
nice
one
hops
and
grapefruit
bitter
all
the
way
through
theres
a
little
bitter
chocolate
taste
mixed
in
too
the
body
is
pretty
thick
moderately
carbonated
with
a
nice
warmth
coming
along
i
feel
like
this
lacks
some
of
the
better
qualities
but
is
a
pretty
good
maibock
if
not
at
least
a
very
unique
one
except
for
the
very
poor
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
one
that
i
would
recommend
from
the
bottle
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
will
look
for
this
again
overall
another
pretty
solid
brew
from
rogue
nothing
earth
shattering
but
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
was
a
very
good
beer
im
keane
to
hops
but
this
was
the
best
balanced
beer
that
i
have
tasted
in
a
long
time
o
a
quality
beer
a
definite
recomendation
on
this
one
d
drinkable
yes
but
i
could
go
for
a
bit
more
character
with
my
elevated
abv
brew
do
i
recommend
this
yes
but
words
of
wisdom
pour
it
in
a
glass
d
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
good
company
i
will
recommend
it
a
versatile
anytime
beer
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pilsner
glass
poured
golden
amber
with
an
inch
thick
white
foam
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
gave
off
anice
floral
scent
with
a
hoppy
malt
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
immediate
honey
sweetness
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
bite
finished
with
slight
alcohol
warmth
overall
a
nice
medium
bodied
crisp
feel
with
fairly
light
carbonation
good
hoppy
spice
feel
enjoyed
this
one
and
could
defintely
a
couple
more
of
these
tasty
bombers
id
heard
good
things
about
dead
guy
ale
and
though
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
all
the
hype
imo
it
was
certainly
worthy
of
some
praise
d
a
wellbalanced
taste
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
made
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
goes
down
nice
and
easy
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
nice
half
inch
head
smell
is
has
malty
aromas
and
alcohol
not
much
to
excited
about
here
taste
is
moderately
bitter
but
goes
down
pretty
smooth
malts
here
are
kept
pretty
low
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
unfortunately
the
hops
overpower
the
maltiness
its
really
not
that
drinkable
of
a
beer
but
this
is
probably
because
the
strong
flavours
arent
my
favourite
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
balanced
beer
that
hides
its
6
5
abv
very
well
not
a
bad
session
beer
drinkability
alcohol
is
kind
of
high
for
what
it
is
but
overall
i
could
drink
a
couple
pints
of
this
if
i
could
ever
find
it
on
tap
in
the
great
white
north
damned
polar
bears
stealing
all
the
rogue
a
good
beer
maibocks
are
a
style
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
and
perhaps
the
phenols
i
found
slightly
irksome
are
simply
natural
and
maybe
even
desirable
flavors
and
aromas
of
this
style
taking
those
out
of
the
equation
however
and
this
is
a
great
crisp
delicious
beer
decently
light
but
has
a
good
mouth
feel
and
definite
boldness
pretty
big
flavor
packed
into
this
very
enjoyable
d
i
heard
alot
about
this
beer
ut
wasnt
overly
crazy
about
it
great
flavor
fruity
malty
goodness
with
a
dry
hop
finish
one
of
the
better
rogue
ales
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
34
inch
white
head
there
was
a
sweet
smell
to
this
very
fruity
with
hints
of
spice
a
little
citrus
maybe
orange
or
grapefruit
and
a
mild
cinnamon
hint
tastes
smooth
with
little
carbonation
very
full
of
the
fruitiness
you
smell
subtle
hints
of
spice
this
is
a
lighter
body
brew
but
very
refreshing
very
solid
ale
note
i
am
not
going
to
say
that
one
should
not
purchase
this
beer
as
i
have
bought
this
and
liked
it
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
d
solid
session
beer
but
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
d
very
nice
ubiquitous
beer
wont
buy
it
very
often
as
for
the
price
there
are
superior
brews
but
its
pretty
darn
good
as
massproduced
craft
beers
go
an
awesome
everyday
anytime
beer
this
poured
a
dark
copper
with
only
a
little
head
by
far
the
mildest
beer
ive
had
from
rogue
it
smelled
and
tasted
of
very
sweet
citrus
hops
and
malt
blend
it
had
really
good
texture
and
a
mild
aftertaste
it
had
a
decent
overall
flavor
that
was
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
special
bought
this
in
a
half
gallon
sized
bottle
ended
up
resealing
and
finishing
the
day
after
which
probably
wasnt
the
best
idea
but
it
did
indeed
maintain
is
carbonation
which
was
good
the
beer
had
a
bit
of
hoppiness
to
it
but
nothing
overwhelming
and
overall
tasted
very
good
at
first
smell
it
seemed
to
have
a
strong
alcoholic
odor
but
mellowed
out
while
the
bottle
was
open
it
was
a
very
nice
amber
color
it
had
nice
sized
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
with
little
to
no
lacing
visible
it
had
a
slight
hoppy
and
caramel
taste
as
well
as
pumpkin
especially
in
the
finish
it
had
a
nice
mouth
feel
with
good
carbonation
enjoyable
to
drink
d
i
will
enjoy
this
often
a
very
solid
maibock
poured
a
cloudy
amber
from
a
12
oz
bottle
smell
was
apple
juice
and
fruity
with
a
faint
hop
aroma
taste
is
nice
sweet
malt
but
not
too
sweet
with
a
mild
hop
finish
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
because
it
just
says
ale
but
man
it
was
a
nice
balance
sweet
malt
based
with
a
well
balanced
hop
finish
mouth
feel
is
wonderful
perfectly
carbonated
in
my
opinion
the
drinkability
for
me
isnt
the
best
though
6
5
i
can
hang
with
3
at
the
most
i
couldnt
sit
there
and
drink
like
6
of
these
12oz
but
id
like
to
start
a
session
with
just
one
of
these
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
just
brewed
the
recipie
hopfully
it
turns
out
as
good
as
the
original
aroma
is
predominantly
malty
caramel
hints
of
fruitiness
on
the
palate
there
is
soft
carbonation
and
medium
body
a
bit
sticky
in
the
finish
taste
is
much
less
sweet
than
expected
from
the
smell
but
sweetness
is
there
but
a
masterful
balance
of
crisp
hoppy
bitterness
hints
of
spice
and
alcohol
tingling
a
constant
interplay
between
malt
and
hops
that
keeps
this
substantial
beer
almost
refreshing
not
a
dry
thirst
quencher
but
invigorates
the
palate
this
aspect
makes
this
beer
quite
drinkable
even
as
i
am
licking
the
sweet
malt
of
my
lips
i
am
ready
to
reach
for
another
great
with
food
very
well
made
brew
md
very
well
balanced
with
good
carbonation
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
not
bad
easy
going
a
versatile
anytime
beer
d
tasty
brew
indeed
however
the
taste
become
a
bit
redundant
after
2
also
the
tartness
becomes
a
bit
too
dominant
after
the
first
1
still
i
recommend
trying
this
d
quite
drinkable
im
sure
ill
tip
a
few
of
these
back
today
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
in
all
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
tasty
though
is
it
really
a
maibock
if
so
why
do
they
call
it
an
ale
keep
these
questions
in
mind
as
you
consider
this
review
first
off
its
got
a
great
look
honey
to
almostamber
hue
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
confusing
to
me
though
with
aromas
of
honey
and
tropical
fruit
but
imo
too
much
hop
fragrance
for
a
maibock
same
with
the
taste
a
nice
malty
sweetness
hits
your
tongue
but
gives
way
to
a
rather
bitter
typical
rogue
hop
finish
overall
decent
i
may
give
this
one
another
shot
someday
i
feel
like
something
i
ate
or
drank
beforehand
threw
off
the
flavor
either
that
or
the
beer
was
old
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
but
its
a
style
that
isnt
my
favorite
very
good
forthe
style
though
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
low
alcohol
and
great
flavor
orangereddish
hue
with
almost
slight
foam
which
almost
completely
disappears
after
a
few
minutes
smells
of
malts
lots
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
with
faint
aroma
of
hops
malts
dominate
the
flavor
but
theres
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
fruity
esters
even
at
6
5
abv
this
was
very
drinkable
as
i
could
not
wait
until
the
next
sip
pours
a
bright
hazy
brown
color
with
a
nice
eggshell
colored
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
a
slight
cap
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
breadydoughy
munchen
malt
with
a
floral
honey
aroma
the
taste
upfront
is
of
the
doughy
munich
malt
honey
a
touch
of
ash
and
bitter
hop
perhaps
a
very
slight
hint
on
lemon
and
pepper
the
feel
is
moderate
with
semisoft
carbonation
finishes
well
balanced
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
ale
the
sweetness
of
the
munich
malt
is
offset
with
some
bitter
hops
the
feel
remains
light
thus
making
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
solid
beer
a
hazy
amber
in
appearance
with
a
white
head
a
fruity
smell
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
flower
petals
sweet
in
taste
with
a
good
bite
from
the
alcohol
and
carbonation
an
incredibly
balanced
beer
i
really
like
this
one
from
rogue
easily
drinkable
wife
doesnt
like
the
bite
i
likey
the
bite
an
allaround
must
for
beer
lovers
pours
a
darkishbrown
w
ruby
tints
with
marginal
head
that
leaves
tiny
amounts
of
lacings
a
malty
smell
follows
although
there
are
dark
fruit
smells
that
i
picked
up
a
very
smooth
beer
with
a
light
to
medium
body
which
underlies
a
very
malty
taste
cant
tell
if
there
are
some
coffee
or
roastedtoasted
malts
in
there
but
there
is
a
malty
sharpness
overall
it
is
smooth
because
there
is
some
faint
sweetness
brought
on
but
this
is
balanced
with
a
dryer
backbite
from
the
hops
at
6
it
is
just
there
for
sessioning
buy
a
sixpack
and
chill
out
with
this
beer
very
nice
aside
from
the
aroma
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
i
think
it
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
d
i
really
like
the
hop
levels
very
nice
punch
youre
not
to
miss
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
this
is
a
very
flavorful
ale
i
could
and
am
going
to
right
now
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
get
this
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
augusta
drinkability
is
good
a
tad
sweet
to
throw
down
too
many
but
it
was
tasty
for
sure
very
nice
brew
just
solid
wellbalanced
btw
goes
amazingly
well
with
a
buttery
toasty
reuben
sandwich
w
swiss
cheese
overall
this
was
a
well
combined
effort
with
the
senses
having
a
go
at
the
hops
malt
and
alcohol
presence
there
was
not
a
lot
of
lacing
later
on
but
it
is
still
a
keeper
at
least
for
a
little
while
pours
amberbrown
whte
head
drops
cleanly
aroma
is
dark
fruits
over
a
malt
base
flavor
is
toasted
malt
with
some
bitter
hops
coming
through
at
the
finish
alcohal
warmth
is
not
overpowering
but
more
than
expected
for
6
6
abv
a
nice
beer
id
have
again
d
extraordinarily
drinkable
excellent
sessionability
one
is
definitely
not
enough
very
nice
taste
not
very
complex
but
very
smooth
another
winner
for
rogue
cloudy
reddish
brown
pour
typically
smell
similar
to
the
few
other
heller
bocks
ive
had
sweet
tart
taste
and
smell
of
dried
fruit
and
honey
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
too
best
one
ive
had
of
the
style
but
its
still
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
say
this
grew
on
me
a
little
bit
but
i
dont
see
buying
it
again
still
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
white
3finger
head
that
left
no
real
laceing
and
went
away
quickly
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
honey
and
light
floral
hops
the
taste
gave
way
to
a
little
more
hops
with
more
of
a
malt
and
honey
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
and
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
decent
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
definatly
will
be
one
to
pick
up
agian
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
i
do
not
consider
this
to
be
an
example
of
a
maibock
though
d
a
little
too
much
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
id
go
back
to
this
again
however
would
go
well
with
highly
seasoned
food
metaphorzz
di
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
so
far
its
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
props
to
inebrio
for
recommending
this
one
i
tried
hard
to
be
objective
reviewing
this
ale
i
waited
a
long
time
to
review
it
because
it
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
man
this
is
good
i
like
the
maltiness
but
i
also
like
that
bitter
citrus
finish
and
this
one
has
them
both
without
being
too
refined
perhaps
thats
what
i
like
about
it
its
just
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
and
i
like
it
one
of
my
favorite
standbys
after
a
long
day
at
work
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
much
better
than
their
american
amber
aroma
is
mainly
malty
with
some
light
grapefruit
apricot
grapes
and
yeast
pours
a
medium
cloudy
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
goes
away
flavor
is
good
sweet
throughout
with
a
nice
alcoholic
bite
in
the
finish
quite
nice
i
would
by
this
again
and
serve
to
dinner
guests
well
worth
getting
a
sixxer
if
you
can
find
one
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
you
can
definitely
compare
this
to
a
germanbockstyle
beer
though
it
has
a
far
bigger
malt
flavor
and
smell
than
anything
ive
had
in
this
style
i
like
to
smell
my
beer
before
each
sip
and
each
time
i
smell
this
beer
i
think
of
how
grains
smell
in
the
mashing
stage
of
brewing
filling
the
room
with
that
awesome
roasting
grain
smell
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
tastes
good
goes
down
smooth
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
threw
back
3
of
them
in
the
4th
quarter
of
the
super
bowl
gmen
baby
dead
guy
is
a
brew
that
i
pass
on
nearly
every
time
i
see
it
at
the
store
is
it
a
maibock
is
it
not
it
is
probably
a
very
clean
malt
dominant
brew
with
a
slight
cold
conditioning
i
probably
should
pick
it
up
more
often
but
it
is
sorta
in
my
fat
tire
category
i
used
to
drink
it
all
the
time
67
years
ago
and
got
burnt
out
on
it
overall
a
beer
that
deserves
more
respect
than
i
give
it
an
interesting
ale
indeed
picked
up
a
single
a
while
ago
and
couldnt
remember
how
it
tastes
so
i
got
another
one
due
to
the
lack
of
a
chilled
glass
i
am
having
this
one
strait
out
of
the
bottle
but
even
still
its
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
maybe
a
touch
overcarbonated
and
i
agree
with
another
reviewer
about
this
beer
its
a
nice
ale
but
nothing
that
reaches
out
and
tells
you
its
a
rouge
ale
without
the
unfortunate
metallic
flavors
this
would
be
a
quite
delicious
quencher
and
fairly
sessionable
as
it
is
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
way
for
this
one
any
time
soon
still
if
you
want
to
enjoy
an
ale
heres
one
to
reach
for
appearance
was
a
murky
brownish
orange
with
no
real
head
and
no
lacing
smell
took
a
while
to
get
used
to
probably
because
i
am
unaccustomed
to
this
particular
style
of
beer
the
smell
is
mainly
of
caramel
and
fruit
though
i
detected
some
veggies
in
there
organic
is
a
word
that
comes
to
mind
though
not
in
the
sense
that
it
is
used
today
it
just
smells
of
things
found
in
nature
taste
is
very
interesting
i
havent
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
pretty
well
balanced
malts
fruits
some
vegetables
and
yeast
medium
bodied
and
very
carbonated
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
before
i
must
try
this
and
other
examples
of
the
style
again
sometime
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
how
this
one
holds
up
dfirst
time
i
have
had
the
beer
and
i
want
another
i
would
like
to
have
a
sixer
of
this
for
the
weekend
poured
into
standard
shaker
pint
glass
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
that
has
a
2
finger
thick
head
the
head
disappaited
very
quickly
but
clinged
to
the
side
and
left
a
ring
around
the
top
aroma
smelled
hoppy
with
small
hints
of
lemon
and
spice
tasted
clean
slightly
bitter
and
also
oakey
mouthfeel
was
good
coated
well
slightly
carbonated
went
down
well
and
was
easy
to
drink
alcohol
wasnt
too
strong
always
a
good
goto
beer
when
nothing
else
seems
to
satisfy
i
cant
belive
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
sooner
as
we
all
know
an
english
ipa
is
far
different
from
its
american
counterpart
less
hopcitrussy
profile
and
this
is
what
i
felt
this
was
comparitive
too
great
with
my
local
bbqs
pulled
pork
sandwich
and
slaw
overall
i
found
the
balance
to
be
very
appealing
although
the
head
was
poor
and
the
lacing
was
almost
nonexistent
with
a
stronger
nose
and
lighter
carbonation
it
would
improve
greatly
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
more
enjoyable
than
expected
pours
a
golden
honey
color
nice
white
head
settles
fairly
quickly
you
can
definetly
smell
the
malts
and
some
of
the
saaz
hops
at
first
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
in
check
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
sticky
on
the
finish
a
very
well
balanced
solid
offering
definetly
worth
a
try
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
but
the
bottle
is
solid
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
but
it
seems
that
it
would
be
better
on
tap
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
due
to
the
sweetness
but
a
very
good
tasting
beer
a
great
beer
for
the
beer
impaired
to
be
introduced
to
the
good
things
in
life
i
would
really
love
a
six
pack
of
these
bones
after
a
hard
day
of
mountain
biking
two
for
me
two
for
my
riding
partner
and
one
for
each
of
us
on
the
ride
home
oops
did
i
say
that
maybe
thats
how
it
got
its
name
it
is
very
drinkable
and
balanced
my
only
concern
is
the
price
it
was
a
9
99
six
pack
at
my
local
store
personally
i
would
rather
go
for
a
dfh
90min
4pk
for
the
same
price
and
im
sure
you
could
find
something
in
the
same
style
range
for
a
lesser
price
nonetheless
i
would
try
it
again
great
brew
try
the
russian
imperial
stout
it
will
blow
your
mind
d
a
highly
drinkable
session
beer
this
a
strong
ale
that
is
fairly
thick
but
goes
down
smooth
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
from
the
fine
brewers
at
rogue
my
overall
impression
was
this
was
just
an
excellent
brew
to
drink
nothing
fancy
but
just
very
well
balanced
and
what
was
definitely
weird
about
it
was
the
flavors
seemed
to
shift
as
the
beer
warmed
up
becoming
a
little
sweeter
and
more
malt
flavor
coming
through
definitely
a
beer
id
buy
again
it
was
smoother
than
i
expected
and
easy
to
drink
note
definetly
a
session
beer
easy
to
drink
it
pours
a
copper
color
into
my
glass
with
a
medium
body
the
head
on
top
rises
nicely
and
is
sturdy
this
is
a
very
mellow
beer
to
drink
a
little
sweet
but
then
overtaken
by
soft
hops
which
are
floral
and
tealike
its
a
drinkable
brew
which
i
would
have
never
guessed
contained
a
6
5
abv
the
appearance
was
very
nice
with
an
off
amber
color
the
smell
was
somewhat
above
average
never
really
overwhelming
at
any
point
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
lively
and
carbonated
id
never
tried
a
maibock
style
beer
and
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
had
an
overly
tart
malty
taste
to
it
that
didnt
really
cut
it
for
me
overall
its
an
okay
beer
not
something
to
add
to
a
list
of
favorites
pours
a
great
copper
color
with
excellent
head
and
lacing
nice
malty
scent
floral
and
pleasing
with
a
good
hop
balance
great
taste
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
well
blended
flavors
with
a
slight
caramel
hint
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
tap
beers
too
12
oz
bottle
a
orangeamber
pretty
thick
carbonation
head
that
retains
to
a
thin
layer
pretty
quickly
s
pretty
malty
some
citrusy
hops
in
there
t
muted
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
some
watery
citrus
and
lingering
bitter
hops
some
caramel
in
there
too
m
nice
thick
character
maybe
a
tad
thin
d
ive
been
drinking
this
for
a
while
now
this
is
the
first
time
that
ive
actually
ventured
to
review
it
it
was
one
of
the
first
truly
good
beers
that
i
recognized
as
a
young
drinker
and
im
sure
ill
be
sipping
on
it
for
years
to
come
great
balance
nice
crisp
character
excellent
drinking
beer
drinkability
ive
had
this
brew
many
times
im
assuming
the
anniversary
is
the
same
as
the
dead
guy
but
for
some
reason
this
seems
a
bit
more
fruity
probably
just
in
my
head
its
a
solid
brew
that
is
good
every
time
anytime
on
a
side
note
when
i
make
chili
i
use
either
a
bomber
of
dead
guy
ale
or
chipotle
ale
every
time
great
beer
for
cooking
poured
into
a
tapered
glass
thick
head
of
foam
that
settles
into
a
creamy
lace
dark
honey
like
color
and
sweet
smelling
not
very
hoppy
right
off
that
the
bat
but
has
a
nice
little
bite
at
the
end
very
drinkable
and
smooth
this
is
both
a
great
sipping
and
session
beer
at
about
10
bucks
a
six
pack
you
wouldnt
want
to
just
guzzle
this
stuff
down
great
stuff
d
not
bad
at
all
i
would
accept
one
of
these
anytime
im
new
to
the
style
but
this
was
a
very
drinkable
brew
so
it
seems
im
2
for
2
as
both
the
maibocks
ive
had
have
been
very
tasty
try
this
one
out
this
the
first
rogue
beer
that
i
ever
tasted
and
the
one
that
sparked
my
movement
away
from
light
macro
brews
and
into
the
good
stuff
i
had
not
had
it
since
and
just
got
into
reviewing
but
now
i
remember
why
the
movement
began
this
is
a
great
beer
that
should
be
stocked
in
every
fridge
at
all
times
rich
and
creamy
tasting
somewhat
sweet
as
well
slightly
dry
with
a
roasted
burnt
malt
taste
long
lingering
aftertaste
heavy
in
the
mouth
a
little
to
much
for
a
considered
ale
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
was
hoping
to
rate
it
better
but
i
will
try
it
again
no
problems
with
drinkability
as
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
its
the
third
time
ive
used
the
word
but
the
key
here
is
balance
it
just
makes
me
proud
to
be
an
american
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
copperorange
color
with
a
pillowy
onefinger
offwhite
colored
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
slightly
toasted
notes
coming
to
the
forefront
also
a
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
also
has
the
sweetness
of
the
nose
but
is
better
balanced
with
a
definite
earthy
hoppiness
and
slight
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
that
makes
for
easy
drinking
drinkability
of
this
one
is
pretty
high
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
too
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
pretty
solid
decent
to
above
average
nothing
special
but
will
do
the
trick
if
nothing
else
is
available
d
this
is
a
good
ale
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
could
be
a
session
beer
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
very
nice
would
make
a
good
session
ale
although
it
is
6
5
very
drinkable
brew
poured
out
of
the
64
ounce
growler
the
glow
in
the
dark
one
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
with
some
lacing
nose
is
sweet
with
a
berry
tone
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bitter
edge
on
the
tail
mouth
is
smooth
and
a
little
bit
heavy
with
a
slight
bit
of
bubble
that
clings
to
your
mouth
extremely
drinkable
due
to
its
smooth
tone
and
flavor
excellent
brew
better
than
i
remember
maybe
its
the
growler
as
opposed
to
the
bottle
amber
reddish
body
with
off
white
head
strong
malty
aroma
with
slight
spicy
slightly
citrus
note
good
malty
flavor
but
not
too
sweet
there
is
a
spice
in
there
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
good
medium
body
and
good
drinkability
extra
points
because
i
can
and
have
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
can
easily
be
a
session
beer
as
the
6
5
is
well
hidden
and
is
not
a
heavy
beer
wow
the
first
brew
ive
ever
had
from
the
rogue
company
and
im
completely
headoverheels
with
this
beer
definitely
a
terrific
drink
in
my
opinon
the
appearance
is
wonderful
pours
an
amber
and
slightly
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
that
foams
for
a
while
before
dissapating
the
smell
is
awesome
full
of
bready
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
what
truly
makes
this
beer
above
and
beyond
it
is
so
rich
and
thick
that
it
makes
some
other
brews
ive
tried
taste
like
water
the
flavor
is
full
of
caramel
vanilla
and
has
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
the
palate
rich
is
how
id
best
describe
the
tate
mouthfeel
is
great
and
drinkability
is
nearperfect
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
without
the
slightest
bitterness
present
copped
this
beer
singly
for
about
1
99
and
will
definitely
pay
the
10
plus
for
a
sixpack
eager
to
try
other
samples
from
this
brewery
definitely
recommended
feels
milky
and
thick
smooth
like
a
hefeweizen
buttery
and
leaves
a
watery
film
strong
but
really
drinkable
nuanced
and
flavorful
especially
considering
that
its
so
strong
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
beautiful
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
and
leaves
some
okay
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
snickerdoodle
cookies
and
orange
and
lemon
zest
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
back
taste
is
fairly
balanced
between
dry
malt
and
light
slightly
citrusy
hops
its
well
made
but
just
a
tad
bland
and
with
a
slightly
flat
finish
nice
bitter
hops
right
at
the
end
a
little
light
in
the
mouth
and
slightly
watery
but
a
wellmade
easydrinking
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
beer
plays
quite
well
on
the
mouth
with
enough
hops
to
keep
a
clean
palate
carbonation
is
there
but
doesnt
distract
however
it
is
a
strong
full
beer
that
is
best
rounding
out
a
meal
or
having
one
or
two
during
a
ballgame
not
a
great
session
beer
great
brew
it
pushes
limits
and
adds
to
the
meaning
of
a
bock
this
is
possibly
my
favorite
of
rogues
beers
first
time
i
had
dead
guy
trying
it
on
tap
at
a
local
pizzeria
not
bad
but
didnt
blow
me
away
it
presents
itself
nicely
with
two
fingers
of
head
atop
an
ambercopper
body
in
a
pint
glass
the
nose
was
malty
and
i
detected
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
little
else
appeared
the
taste
was
subtle
but
smooth
but
i
was
disappointed
since
the
malt
was
clear
and
some
spice
was
presentginger
paprikabut
little
else
i
was
hoping
for
bolder
flavors
but
was
left
wanting
the
texture
was
smooth
and
ordering
a
second
sure
wasnt
difficult
overall
worth
a
try
and
a
nice
brew
but
nothing
that
will
knock
the
socks
off
this
beer
has
been
reviewed
so
many
times
what
more
can
you
say
all
i
have
to
add
is
the
fact
that
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
it
actually
was
on
tap
i
think
that
it
must
not
age
well
or
something
in
the
bottle
because
i
never
noticed
the
great
malty
caramelly
character
that
i
noticed
on
the
fresh
keg
offering
i
had
tonight
wow
i
was
impressed
ill
definitely
have
it
again
not
bad
at
all
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
ill
be
back
for
more
had
in
its
bottle
at
moan
and
dove
the
drink
poured
with
an
orangelike
amber
to
it
with
a
very
thin
head
faint
hops
and
malts
could
be
smelt
from
the
beverage
a
sweet
citruslike
taste
enveloped
your
mouth
when
sipping
the
drink
its
carbonation
was
great
incredibly
crisp
and
refreshing
with
the
citrus
tastes
and
carbonation
this
is
a
sure
winner
from
rogue
ales
definitely
one
of
their
best
dthis
beer
has
similar
characteristics
of
a
sam
adams
bl
as
far
as
drinkability
but
this
is
much
more
complexand
superior
in
every
imaginable
way
d
great
beer
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
good
all
around
beer
the
bottle
gushed
on
opening
with
amber
colour
and
vigourous
carbonation
solid
beige
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
hoppy
but
with
a
lot
of
caramel
roasted
malt
too
the
smell
is
apparent
even
before
pouring
the
taste
is
similarly
two
dimensional
hops
and
caramelroast
taffy
there
is
a
smooth
buttery
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
drinking
ale
with
a
nice
even
keel
the
hoppy
bitterness
is
balanced
perfectly
with
malt
a
real
taste
treat
and
another
winner
from
rogue
edit
tried
the
growler
version
of
this
found
on
a
shelf
no
clue
how
old
it
could
be
but
seemed
to
have
less
hop
presence
more
malts
more
honey
and
more
light
fruits
apples
peaches
concord
grapes
the
carbonation
was
very
low
i
am
assuming
that
the
growler
had
been
sitting
there
for
months
but
it
still
tasted
excellent
in
its
own
way
nice
job
delighted
to
find
this
offering
from
our
favourite
oregon
on
offer
at
the
local
its
not
in
our
favourite
ipa
category
but
it
is
a
great
allround
beer
nonetheless
copperyred
colour
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
moderate
head
aroma
is
fairly
muted
but
the
palate
glows
with
complex
fruit
and
malt
and
caramel
its
a
bit
chewy
and
very
quaffable
although
i
note
a
fairly
robust
6
5
alcohol
level
the
taste
is
delicious
again
bottles
dont
really
compare
to
a
good
dead
guy
ontap
imo
it
practically
bursts
with
notes
of
fruit
and
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
creamy
vanillabutterscotch
too
the
finale
is
predominantly
hop
territory
as
the
flavor
ends
with
a
bitter
resinous
bite
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
semicreamy
but
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
nearly
perfect
its
complex
flavorful
and
almost
too
easy
to
put
away
a
few
in
one
sitting
hooray
for
dead
guy
my
faith
is
renewed
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
this
is
my
first
beer
within
this
style
so
i
may
just
not
like
the
style
try
it
for
yourself
a
very
good
local
for
me
beer
i
would
recommend
you
try
this
if
you
like
pale
ales
and
the
taste
of
hops
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
american
crafts
ive
had
great
brew
love
rogue
but
need
to
get
a
bottle
and
make
a
new
review
to
make
sure
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
accurate
i
know
when
i
buy
growlers
from
other
breweries
they
say
the
carbonation
should
last
about
10
days
there
is
no
bottling
date
and
the
carbonation
seemed
fine
so
i
grabbed
it
at
a
good
time
or
there
is
something
in
the
bottling
process
final
note
ive
made
this
a
tradition
for
the
past
3
years
to
drink
this
beer
on
day
of
the
dead
but
i
may
start
drinking
it
on
other
days
of
the
year
as
well
dead
guy
is
another
fine
brew
from
rogue
final
thoughts

all
i
can
say
is
awesome
complex
and
well
balanced
make
drinking
this
brew
a
great
experience
a
nice
little
brew
which
reminds
me
of
the
good
life
in
goodbeerstarved
china
d
highly
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
taking
down
a
six
pack
on
a
sunday
afternoon
however
not
one
to
waste
savor
it
while
not
sparing
it
im
sorry
to
keep
refering
bmcs
but
i
really
think
this
growler
thing
is
responsible
for
the
lacking
in
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
ive
had
this
brew
from
the
tap
and
i
was
much
more
impressed
leave
the
growlers
for
the
brewpubs
man
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
34
inch
white
head
there
was
a
sweet
smell
to
this
very
fruity
with
hints
of
spice
a
little
citrus
maybe
orange
or
grapefruit
and
a
mild
cinnamon
hint
tastes
smooth
with
little
carbonation
very
full
of
the
fruitiness
you
smell
subtle
hints
of
spice
this
is
a
lighter
body
brew
but
very
refreshing
very
solid
ale
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
delicious
d
excellent
and
easily
quaffed
complex
and
one
ill
easily
go
to
again
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
due
to
the
hops
and
strong
flavor
i
recommend
stopping
at
just
a
few
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
never
quite
goes
away
a
small
cloudy
dribble
from
the
end
of
the
bottle
suggests
this
was
bottle
conditioned
but
theres
nothing
on
the
bottle
to
warn
one
about
this
you
may
want
to
pour
gently
and
slowly
so
you
dont
get
any
carryover
lacing
is
minimal
a
nice
malt
aroma
that
translates
into
a
noticable
but
not
cloying
sweet
malt
presence
in
the
flavor
that
is
balanced
by
spicy
hop
bitterness
that
dries
out
the
aftertaste
a
wellbuilt
beer
that
is
certainly
quite
sessionable
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
finley
grill
in
downers
grove
il
and
was
more
impressed
there
than
with
this
bottle
but
did
not
get
to
reviewing
it
in
time
for
my
memory
to
serve
me
well
d
i
wasnt
aware
of
the
abv
until
i
saw
it
here
without
that
knowledge
i
could
imagine
drinking
more
of
these
than
i
could
handle
in
a
night
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
poured
out
of
22
iz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
appeared
a
cloudy
golden
copper
color
aroma
was
pleasant
but
not
exciting
taste
was
malty
mild
again
very
pleasant
but
nothing
exciting
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
dont
think
it
is
great
but
i
will
ceritanly
buy
it
again
and
would
recommened
to
anyone
it
is
an
easy
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
little
lacing
remained
during
the
serving
presented
with
a
hazy
copper
color
and
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
taste
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slightly
astringentcitrus
finish
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
poured
a
murky
orange
brown
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
nice
malty
aroma
with
sweet
citrus
notes
there
is
a
juicy
malt
quality
as
well
as
an
earthy
vibe
to
it
a
bit
dry
but
the
hops
and
malt
are
very
well
balanced
the
finish
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
a
really
good
brew
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
plenty
of
drinkability
comment
two
summers
ago
when
on
a
long
camping
trip
in
southern
oregon
and
northern
california
dead
guy
was
the
beer
of
choice
in
my
cooler
i
find
it
to
be
a
easy
session
drink
and
highly
tolerant
of
nonideal
handling
had
this
beer
on
tap
tonight
with
dinner
it
came
from
the
bar
a
nice
cloudy
brown
with
a
faint
cream
head
on
top
the
beer
had
a
really
good
smell
with
hops
and
malt
that
isnt
too
strong
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
with
a
dry
bite
at
the
end
went
very
well
with
my
dinner
and
look
forward
to
trying
again
dead
guy
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
on
finish
to
aid
in
the
finish
finishes
crisp
and
clean
it
is
well
balanced
for
what
it
is
but
it
definately
is
not
a
big
beer
nicely
done
being
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
a
well
manufactured
brew
and
it
goes
down
easily
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
bigger
beers
normally
but
this
is
one
that
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
when
im
in
the
mood
for
mass
consumption
the
alcohol
isnt
very
noticeable
but
you
can
get
a
sense
of
how
it
is
a
toned
down
bock
it
provides
a
nice
taste
again
i
feel
like
there
is
a
hint
of
apple
some
hops
are
noticeable
but
it
seems
fairly
reserved
anyway
feels
nice
to
drink
not
much
aftertaste
nice
clean
finish
easy
to
drink
beer
that
keeps
you
respectable
im
a
big
fan
of
the
brewery
this
isnt
their
best
but
the
bar
was
set
very
high
long
ago
o
a
staple
for
me
when
i
get
a
healthy
sized
hamburger
at
one
of
my
favorite
spots
d
this
beer
goes
down
good
i
give
her
a
b
mouthfeel
is
solid
at
no
point
does
it
slip
into
the
watery
character
that
some
rogue
brews
do
yet
it
also
resists
the
thickness
that
such
a
maltdriven
beer
can
easily
take
on
nicely
done
i
dont
love
the
beer
although
i
could
see
easily
finishing
the
bomber
still
im
not
sure
how
this
has
become
rogues
flagship
at
least
in
terms
of
visibility
brew
with
so
many
more
easily
approachable
beers
on
their
roster
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
decided
to
revisit
i
had
this
beer
when
i
first
turned
21
a
long
time
ago
give
this
beer
a
try
i
bought
a
case
for
about
38
ive
been
going
on
a
roguesampling
binge
and
maybe
one
of
the
four
beers
ive
tried
has
been
to
my
taste
i
appreciate
that
folks
love
the
rogue
brewery
but
at
this
point
im
beginning
to
suspect
that
their
offerings
are
not
for
me
d
extremely
drinkable
i
found
myself
downing
it
a
little
too
fast
and
had
to
slow
down
i
bought
a
six
and
it
wont
last
very
long
it
pours
a
very
nice
deep
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
on
it
sweet
malt
and
floral
aromas
for
the
smell
the
first
sip
is
very
malty
and
well
balance
with
medium
carbination
as
the
beer
warmed
i
got
a
good
taste
of
toasted
malts
and
a
slight
breadiness
great
mouth
feel
that
is
light
and
would
be
nice
on
a
warm
day
very
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
offering
from
rouge
old
standby
good
beer
drinkability
finally
a
rogue
beer
that
i
enjoy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
nice
and
has
a
good
taste
d
it
drinks
easy
enough
with
the
lighter
body
but
the
higher
carbonation
and
nothing
in
the
taste
department
makes
this
less
than
ideal
for
a
good
session
beer
it
has
a
unique
mellowness
to
it
as
it
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malt
i
taste
a
citrus
fruit
like
a
sweet
lemon
or
lime
flavor
the
ale
finishes
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
as
it
leaves
its
trail
on
the
back
of
you
throat
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
at
the
beach
and
it
is
a
nice
style
to
quaff
available
in
six
packs
and
bombers
for
those
of
you
wanting
to
try
this
d
very
easy
on
the
pallet
to
quaf
not
as
much
head
as
id
like
thats
what
she
said
it
smells
kind
of
creamy
a
strong
maltiness
with
a
slight
balance
of
hops
that
gives
it
a
very
slight
tinge
of
floral
aroma
it
tastes
much
like
it
smells
creamy
slightly
toasted
malts
with
just
a
fine
balance
of
hops
and
it
warms
excellently
unlike
some
hopheavy
brews
it
tastes
good
and
feels
good
enough
going
down
that
i
know
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
thats
what
she
said
im
confused
as
to
why
its
called
an
ale
however
when
even
rogue
refers
to
it
as
a
maibock
d
this
is
a
really
drinkable
ale
one
of
my
favorites
currently
a
very
pleasing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
one
of
my
favorites
dead
guy
is
a
brew
to
share
among
friends
or
just
to
relax
with
and
enjoy
by
yourself
great
stuff
a
honey
colored
body
under
a
rocky
1f
crown
of
ivory
with
fair
retention
good
lacing
with
long
legs
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
a
light
nose
of
caramelsweet
malts
with
a
whiff
of
pit
fruit
on
a
summer
breeze
the
flavors
are
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
for
the
nonhop
head
that
i
am
earthy
with
some
white
grapes
and
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
and
hop
bittering
ying
and
yang
in
liquid
form
a
fairly
light
body
belies
the
long
legs
that
continue
to
coat
my
glass
and
the
soft
carbonation
matches
the
whole
picture
to
a
tee
hard
to
believe
this
is
not
a
european
brew
more
so
that
its
a
west
coast
beer
pours
a
deep
very
reddish
amber
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
dusting
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
fruit
and
potpurri
spices
too
it
as
well
as
some
musky
hops
and
amber
malts
an
ale
character
suffuses
all
of
this
on
the
palate
rough
fruits
and
scratchy
hops
first
off
followed
by
some
tealike
malts
at
the
midpalate
the
finish
dries
out
and
brings
a
hoppy
bite
and
some
alcoholic
burn
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
but
its
no
maibock
very
alelike
character
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
which
has
too
many
rough
edges
for
a
lager
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
stylistic
distinction
its
still
a
beer
that
drinks
well
overall
a
very
good
brew
with
a
nice
balance
theres
something
slightly
odd
about
the
hops
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
but
it
isnt
bad
overall
quite
delicious
this
really
hits
the
spot
i
need
to
find
some
more
rogue
brews
oall
drinkability
a
maltdominated
beer
with
exceptionally
clean
character
could
use
more
hop
flavor
if
an
ambert
ale
works
fairly
well
as
an
american
brown
body
is
medium
light
to
medium
there
is
a
slight
buttery
quailty
that
has
always
been
here
its
been
a
long
time
what
a
great
beer
why
do
i
forget
some
of
these
greats

after
a
year
of
not
having
this
beer
and
after
many
more
beer
tastings
with
a
new
refined
palette
i
can
say
i
have
a
much
greater
appreciation
for
this
beer
the
honey
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
of
this
brew
is
amazing
id
agree
that
the
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
of
a
smack
in
the
face
but
that
sweet
flavor
is
wonderful
wow
rogue
does
it
again
gorgeous
orange
color
with
thick
foamy
tan
head
subtle
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
rich
malt
scent
taste
is
almost
all
malt
foam
too
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
alcohol
is
in
check
and
with
rich
flavor
and
gentle
carbonation
this
is
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
wow
a
true
malt
bomb
this
rogue
offering
poured
a
fairly
opaque
brown
capped
by
a
creamy
foamy
head
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
aroma
is
all
malt
caramel
and
other
sweet
fruits
in
the
nose
as
well
apples
are
brought
to
mind
taste
is
more
malt
any
hops
in
this
brew
are
buried
the
malt
taste
has
layers
of
vanilla
apples
and
yeast
mouthfeel
isnt
as
thick
and
chewy
as
one
would
expect
from
a
malt
bomb
pleasantly
crisp
extremely
drinkable
do
so
with
caution
this
darker
beer
comes
with
testosterone
not
literally
you
have
to
be
a
real
man
to
dig
this
stuff
or
an
extreme
beer
lover
not
to
exclude
our
women
beer
lovers
i
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
if
you
are
someone
who
wants
to
get
into
beer
tasting
make
dead
guy
ale
one
of
your
first
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
since
it
has
been
a
few
months
since
i
last
had
a
pint
of
dead
guy
and
i
have
drank
many
beers
since
dead
guy
is
a
pretty
smooth
beer
the
real
flavor
comes
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
when
it
hits
you
and
you
think
this
is
a
great
beer
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
head
and
a
decent
retention
smell
of
malts
caramel
it
was
a
little
bit
bitter
taste
nuts
and
hops
a
good
mouthfeel
not
to
waterery
a
good
beer
just
not
to
my
liking
to
much
clashing
between
hops
and
sweet
i
would
drink
another
but
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
overall
a
great
beer
complex
with
a
great
taste
and
highly
drinkable
on
top
of
that
this
beer
is
really
really
good
an
orange
amber
color
with
big
bubbles
in
a
otherwise
thin
head
that
settles
to
a
modest
lace
the
smell
is
not
very
perceptable
a
very
light
biscuit
there
is
a
little
bite
at
first
taste
but
then
a
dryhopped
middle
to
it
a
bitterness
that
hints
at
licorice
kind
of
tangy
at
the
front
but
not
much
aftertaste
here
overall
its
good
i
would
drink
any
time
a
very
good
ale
interesting
in
that
it
uses
a
malt
recipe
for
a
bock
but
uses
topfermenting
ale
yeast
a
little
different
than
your
traditional
ale
it
might
not
appeal
to
some
if
you
want
more
of
a
traditional
ale
try
rogue
american
amber
ale
smell
and
taste
of
caramel
hops
a
bit
of
a
sweet
taste
poured
with
small
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
some
hop
bitterness
d
delicious
with
just
enough
sedation
to
prove
to
be
a
solid
session
candidate
d
close
to
the
top
if
not
one
of
the
best
you
can
hardly
tell
its
6
5
until
you
drink
3
and
stand
up
cannot
wait
to
try
more
from
rogue
overall
a
good
strong
beer
this
is
a
malty
beer
that
is
higher
in
alcohol
it
does
taste
like
a
good
bock
but
bocks
are
bottom
fermented
and
this
beer
is
top
fermented
drinkability
good
balance
between
hops
and
malt
very
drinkable
pours
a
medium
honey
color
like
gold
leaning
to
copper
and
was
a
touch
hazy
initial
head
was
about
one
inch
to
a
film
this
drops
to
a
thin
layer
but
never
sweet
in
the
smell
came
through
like
peach
with
some
sweetsharp
orange
coming
off
the
hops
taste
gets
complex
but
orange
comes
through
more
than
anything
else
hop
bitterness
is
solid
but
not
huge
or
overpowering
and
the
aftertaste
is
neither
too
astringenthoppy
or
too
sweet
great
mix
with
most
of
the
hops
trailing
off
leaving
a
slightly
dry
orange
kicking
around
mouthfeel
was
at
medium
body
with
a
creaminess
tempered
by
carbonation
that
hits
both
in
front
and
throughout
the
taste
while
the
carbonation
might
make
more
than
one
or
two
these
filling
its
very
drinkable
i
know
its
a
bit
out
of
the
recommended
pairing
but
id
like
to
try
this
with
noncoconut
milkbased
curries
drinkability
a
session
beer
thats
great
with
meals
hazy
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
which
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
slightly
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
herbal
hops
nice
malty
flavor
with
some
interesting
notes
a
bit
buttery
on
my
first
sip
perhaps
some
dark
fruit
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
pretty
good
beer
a
bit
heavier
than
it
seems
at
first
but
still
quite
drinkable
certainly
very
drinkable
at
6
5
though
due
to
its
substantial
flavor
you
might
not
be
in
a
rush
to
session
this
its
a
savory
beer
maibock
is
a
style
a
little
out
of
my
comfort
zone
that
ive
been
appreciating
more
lately
and
this
is
good
stuff
by
my
reckoning
it
pours
a
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
onetwo
finger
head
that
sadly
dissipates
faster
than
i
would
want
it
smells
sweet
though
fainter
again
than
i
would
want
but
thats
ok
as
the
taste
is
what
i
like
most
from
this
one
a
sweet
start
that
moves
to
a
slight
bitterness
that
is
welcomed
greatly
all
in
all
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
despite
its
6
5
alcohol
content
i
would
welcome
this
in
my
fridge
any
day
any
time
i
look
forward
to
more
from
rogue
overall
drinkability
my
first
maibock
and
i
definitely
wanted
another
one
too
bad
i
had
only
purchased
one
bottle
i
cant
see
having
too
many
in
one
sitting
though
as
i
think
the
abv
will
sneek
up
on
you
before
you
know
it
recommended
to
all
this
is
my
first
maibock
and
my
first
example
from
rogue
im
pretty
impressed
and
i
expect
to
see
more
of
this
in
my
fridge
tried
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
my
first
rogue
and
it
did
not
disappoint
poured
clean
out
of
the
line
amber
in
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
was
of
a
slight
fruitiness
generous
use
of
malts
and
maybe
a
note
of
hops
taste
was
just
delicious
a
wellbalanced
beer
robust
example
of
an
ale
balanced
by
malted
barley
fruits
spices
and
a
glancing
of
hops
on
the
tongue
just
a
great
beer
overall
and
a
joy
to
drink
wish
i
had
another
right
now
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
its
taste
and
smell
make
it
a
very
pleasurable
beer
to
drink
time
for
an
update
not
all
too
much
has
changed
except
theres
a
more
distinct
toasty
bready
malt
character
still
sourish
less
cidery
and
more
akin
to
a
nonoaked
white
wine
slight
score
bump
overall
strait
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
brew
has
an
amazing
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
slightly
red
tint
a
good
amount
of
head
that
is
not
quick
to
dissipate
upon
first
sniff
i
get
a
sweet
hoppy
smell
when
i
dig
a
a
bit
deeper
a
muted
fruit
scent
is
detected
it
has
a
very
balanced
taste
clean
wheat
with
a
delightfully
mild
bitterness
which
seems
to
complement
the
flavor
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
all
the
way
through
i
hate
to
use
the
same
descriptor
twice
but
it
finishes
absolutely
cleanly
begging
you
to
drink
more
all
in
all
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
an
average
night
with
some
good
food
and
great
company
pours
a
bright
orangecopper
color
relatively
thick
head
turns
thick
fast
it
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
definite
caramel
hints
far
sweeter
than
it
tastes
it
has
a
biscuitty
taste
that
starts
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
but
that
finishes
a
little
bit
better
mailbocks
arent
my
style
but
rogue
does
this
one
nicely
very
drinkable
beer
with
one
of
the
coolest
labels
ive
seen
overall
rogues
most
wellknown
beer
is
also
one
of
their
best
if
you
love
heavily
malted
beers
then
deadguy
should
have
a
spot
in
your
fridge
almost
an
orangey
gold
colour
with
thick
head
this
beer
smells
like
hops
but
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
expected
this
is
a
session
beer
with
balance
built
in
but
a
full
flavoured
rogue
mouthfeel
i
get
caramel
and
some
fruit
on
the
finish
but
mostly
a
nice
hopmalt
mix
that
satisifies
for
me
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
not
something
i
would
offer
to
people
who
are
not
into
microbrewed
beer
i
enjoy
the
after
taste
and
think
this
beer
is
great
to
bring
to
a
bbq
or
even
with
a
steak
dinner
drinkability
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
extremely
quaffable
and
with
a
fairly
unique
character
that
makes
it
stand
apart
from
other
brews
you
might
commonly
find
in
the
pacific
northwest
drinkability
not
my
favorite
from
rouge
but
one
of
the
better
brews
out
there
today
very
well
done
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mediumlight
bodied
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
the
spritzy
feeling
of
carbonation
nicely
melds
with
the
flavor
of
the
malts
which
suits
this
stylein
my
opinion
quite
nicely
finishes
slightly
dry
was
a
bit
lighter
in
body
than
i
expected
the
brew
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
this
is
something
i
could
be
seeing
myself
buying
again
though
id
like
to
explore
other
offerings
from
the
same
style
first
this
is
always
a
drinkable
brew
no
matter
the
season
or
occassion
its
even
better
on
tap
rogue
scores
again
d
very
drinkable
but
also
complex
enough
to
keep
your
interest
a
must
try
and
a
beer
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
again
quite
nice
very
tasty
and
drinkable
damn
good
i
say
d
easy
drinking
balanced
beer
if
nothing
else
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
that
might
be
a
little
too
strong
for
sessions
recommended
highly
drinkable
not
one
that
i
would
think
to
pair
with
food
though
it
would
go
pretty
well
with
sausages
or
barbequed
chicken
but
certainly
a
good
one
to
sit
back
with
and
enjoy
overall
this
is
another
good
offering
from
rogue
however
this
one
seems
to
defy
convention
at
first
the
taste
and
drinkability
are
topnotch
midway
through
both
seemed
to
lose
a
lot
however
as
the
level
in
my
glass
got
closer
to
0
both
picked
up
again
and
i
could
feel
myself
desiring
another
an
enigma
of
a
beer
pick
it
up
and
decide
for
yourself
my
rating
should
be
accompanied
by
a
because
it
is
that
easy
to
go
back
and
forth
and
this
one
sips
or
gulps
easy
enough
bottle
and
on
tap
pours
a
nice
ambercopper
color
with
a
minimal
head
malty
and
hoppy
in
aroma
and
taste
with
some
citrus
too
slight
bit
of
peppery
bite
in
there
as
well
leaves
a
nice
hop
aftertaste
bought
a
case
of
the
dead
guy
at
the
brewry
while
visiting
newport
or
i
have
not
disliked
a
single
rogue
product
pours
a
fourfinger
creamy
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
clear
amber
color
hoppy

good

bodied

leaves
chunks
of

around
the
glass
as
the
beer
recedes
sweet

with
notes
of

some

as

with

some

sensation
as
well
as
a
sugary

taste
tasty
to
be
sure
although
id
only
want
to
drink
this
beer
fresh
in
my
opinion
maibocks
do
not
age
well
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good

deceptive

content
though
at

abv
another
nice
brew
by
the
folks
at

bright
gorgeous
orange
color
and
a
terrific

is
thick
toasty
and
robust
with
some
very
large

notes
taste

and
huge

presence
mouthfeel
is
substantial
and
sticky
great
great
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
carbonation
is
perfect
this
is
a
great
session
beer
the
abv
may
be
a
little
higher
than
what
some
would
say
a
session
beer
should
be
but
its
so
easy
to
drink
in
my
mind
its
a
great
session
beer
as
most
rogue
brews
are
overall
its
a
good
solid
beer
try
it
one
other
odd
thing
ive
noticed
is
that
this
is
the
only
rogue
beer
ive
ever
seen
that
doesnt
list
all
of
the
ingredients
on
the
label
what
is
in
there
that
they
dont
want
us
beer
geeks
to
know
about
d
a
very
good
beer
not
to
mention
a
great
label
d
as
a
daily
drinker
you
would
be
falling
off
the
chair
but
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
this
goes
down
fairly
easily
and
doesnt
make
me
cringe
or
anything
but
it
doesnt
really
make
me
want
another
bomber
pour
cellar
temperature
into
a
pint
glass
pours
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
doesnt
leave
any
lace
behind
it
has
a
cloudy
orangish
appearance
it
has
an
odd
nose
but
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
it
is
slightly
citrusyflowery
with
some
malts
underneath
the
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
but
not
overly
so
but
this
probably
would
not
appeal
to
someone
who
did
not
like
hops
the
malt
backbone
balances
everything
nicely
and
gives
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
how
representative
of
the
style
this
is
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
pale
golden
color
almost
could
be
mistaken
for
any
of
the
big
three
in
color
decent
hop
aroma
but
the
taste
is
just
way
to
mellow
for
me
i
mean
if
the
object
was
to
finish
as
many
as
possible
this
might
be
my
choice
from
rogue
but
other
than
that
this
was
just
alright
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
seemed
to
be
pretty
balanced
with
the
hops
and
malts
couldnt
taste
any
alcohol
and
the
finish
was
quite
a
bit
dryer
than
most
ales
virtually
no
aftertaste
at
all
if
its
not
my
favorite
beer
its
definitly
close
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
and
give
it
a
try
slightly
hazy
amber
in
the
glass
with
small
creamy
head
aroma
has
that
unique
rogue
malt
combo
smell
to
it
biscuity
doughy
along
with
some
subtle
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
honey
notes
taste
is
a
wellbalanced
interplay
of
the
lightmedium
sweetness
and
substantial
moderate
hop
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
viscosity
soft
carbonation
and
lightly
astringent
in
the
semisweet
finish
why
dont
they
paint
the
labels
on
these
any
more
only
the
bombers
now
was
glad
to
find
this
at
a
normal
chicago
bar
a
nice
after
dinner
ale
thanks
to
scott
bonnie
at
otters
pub
in
my
hometown
for
putting
up
this
really
good
maibock
on
draught
as
it
is
not
seen
often
in
northern
connecticut
coppery
to
lightish
amber
in
color
with
quickly
dissipating
head
and
little
lacing
absent
of
any
real
aroma
this
ones
taste
makes
up
for
its
absence
of
aroma
immediate
sweetness
on
the
tongue
but
not
cloying
no
real
hop
bite
but
still
a
bit
drying
in
the
finishvery
interesting
the
taste
is
very
aggressive
but
not
extreme
nice
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
elevated
abv
is
wellhidden
but
definitely
there
i
really
like
this
version
of
the
stylegood
work
by
rogue
ales
d
it
took
me
over
an
hour
to
finish
the
glass
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
complexity
with
this
ale
the
pour
was
thick
and
the
froth
hung
around
for
awhile
the
color
is
your
nice
clean
amber
typical
of
the
style
the
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
a
bit
of
wheat
also
come
through
the
taste
is
about
the
hops
from
start
to
finish
i
had
to
drink
a
good
pint
to
discern
enough
sweet
caramel
maltiness
in
the
middle
to
appreciate
it
a
bit
more
it
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
i
appreciate
and
definitely
has
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
if
you
go
for
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
above
6
abv
but
the
alcohol
flavor
is
well
masked
by
those
darn
hops
again
not
a
bad
ale
by
any
means
but
just
know
that
youre
in
for
a
hoppy
ride
lchaim
i
was
attracted
by
the
rogue
reputation
and
was
by
no
means
let
down
at
first
glance
i
fell
in
love
with
the
rich
amber
color
the
bock
characteristics
show
in
this
brew
with
a
malty
aroma
and
flavor
hops
really
came
to
place
with
an
average
bitter
kick
i
liked
it
as
this
is
the
first
beer
i
am
reviewing
in
the
style
i
must
say
it
was
a
very
good
start
pours
a
beautifully
semitransparent
copper
this
brew
is
nicely
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
this
absolutely
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
rogue
who
ive
known
previously
only
from
their
stellar
reputation
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
again
drinkability
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
in
comparison
to
other
maibocks
this
beer
pours
almost
a
copperredbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
almost
white
head
the
appearance
for
me
is
exactly
as
an
ale
should
look
makes
my
mouth
water
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
hop
in
there
as
well
as
malts
its
hard
to
seperate
but
a
plesant
sensation
regardless
the
taste
is
where
this
ale
really
shines
its
very
smooth
with
a
little
sweetness
mixed
with
hop
bitterness
none
of
which
over
powers
and
the
way
they
balance
out
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
that
is
not
heavy
at
all
and
makes
this
drink
more
robust
but
still
very
drinkable
very
good
al
highly
suggest
trying
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
not
what
i
consider
a
session
beer
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
similar
to
its
bottled
counterpart
the
main
difference
being
the
mouthfeel
which
takes
on
an
almost
guinnesslike
thickness
maybe
a
little
bit
sweeter
a
little
bit
stickier
but
all
of
the
same
flavors
of
bread
fruits
honey
and
spices
are
present
reddishorange
with
slight
chillhaze
with
a
thick
meltedvanillaicecream
head
smells
fruity
a
bit
like
vegetables
cucumber
caramelsweetness
and
booze
taste
is
much
the
same
but
with
added
spice
and
berries
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
crisp
at
first
then
quite
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
finish
quite
drinkable
as
i
once
polished
off
a
growler
of
this
stuff
with
little
to
no
help
taste
is
certainly
pleasant
a
nice
mix
of
mellow
buttery
sweetness
and
some
more
herbal
hop
flavours
anise
lemon
earth
tart
apples
and
some
more
medicinal
bitter
flavours
that
arent
unpleasant
but
are
definitely
there
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
and
malty
but
dries
well
and
sticks
to
the
throat
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
evident
than
expected
and
carbonation
might
be
a
bit
better
if
it
was
toned
down
just
a
little
that
said
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
im
really
enjoying
it
tonight
its
the
kind
of
thing
i
can
really
go
for
late
in
the
year
it
just
screams
autumn
didnt
blow
my
head
off
but
sessionable
well
done
rogue
this
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
and
had
been
one
of
my
favorites
long
before
i
realized
just
how
vast
the
world
of
craft
beer
really
was
the
beer
was
served
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
diminished
into
a
ring
but
still
left
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
mild
amount
of
earthy
hops
behind
it
the
taste
was
heavy
on
the
malt
as
any
maibock
should
be
but
this
being
brewed
as
an
ale
the
earthy
hops
shine
through
a
lot
more
than
they
do
in
any
other
beer
of
this
style
the
beer
is
not
heavy
at
all
and
is
very
enjoyable
i
will
always
consider
this
a
great
session
beer
even
though
it
is
6
5
you
guys
get
a
3
5
for
this
stuff
and
hey
stop
messing
with
my
head
overall
an
easily
drinkable
beer
with
a
very
distinct
flavor
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
reminds
me
of
honey
with
a
finger
of
of
white
foam
that
quickly
fades
smells
of
sweet
fruit
and
malt
as
well
as
some
alcohol
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
crisp
tart
apple
notes
and
bitter
lemony
hops
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
an
overall
consistent
offering
from
rouge
that
i
revisit
a
few
times
a
year
i
realize
my
review
sounds
negative
but
i
was
trying
to
find
flaws
in
one
of
my
favorite
brews
as
for
the
positive
aspects
of
it
well
let
me
just
say
its
delicious
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
worthy
of
trying
but
its
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
carbonation
department
for
me
to
really
enjoy
and
the
taste
while
generally
nice
doeesnt
correspond
to
my
personal
liking
d
sessionable
good
flavor
like
rogues
twist
on
this
style
very
enjoyable
recommended
overall
although
i
want
to
i
have
a
hard
time
really
liking
this
beer
each
characteristic
tends
to
stand
alone

the
experience
is
not
very
well
integrated
d
its
a
great
beer
with
a
lot
of
wonderful
flavors
the
best
part
is
that
no
one
flavor
really
silences
the
rest
making
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
good
brew
think
of
a
pale
ale
with
a
good
lightmalt
background
ill
have
to
keep
a
sixer
of
this
around
good
stuff
seriously
easy
drinking
with
enough
character
to
keep
you
coming
back
d
this
took
me
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
consume
considering
the
low
abv
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
this
is
not
even
close
gto
my
favorite
rogue
ale
but
is
solid
nonetheless
and
a
musthave
with
thai
food
d
awesome
all
the
elements
combined
made
this
beer
insanely
drinkable
with
incredible
flavors
being
bounced
around
cant
wait
to
buy
a
growler
this
weekend
and
really
go
to
town
oelergud
bottled
i
drank
a
bit
of
this
a
few
years
ago
but
have
not
had
any
recently
until
this
week
just
poured
a
bottle
pours
and
smells
a
basic
pale
ale
flavor
seems
slightly
more
malt
directed
than
others
it
is
good
and
refreshing
not
a
favorite
but
not
crap
either
still
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
session
beer
i
will
be
drinking
all
6
of
these
bad
boys
downright
drinkable
and
splendid
taste
dead
guy
does
pretty
good
all
the
way
around
gives
of
a
lot
of
co2
for
a
good
light
tan
head
and
retains
very
well
medium
bodied
with
a
dark
golden
amber
hue
gives
off
aromas
of
grapes
molasses
and
a
weird
coppery
aroma
like
pennies
this
tastes
very
sweet
and
malty
theres
a
dominant
molasses
flavor
here
too
this
ale
feels
very
warm
and
inviting
with
each
sip
i
feel
more
alive
than
dead
while
drinking
this
concoction
dead
guy
is
so
strong
that
it
was
kind
of
hard
to
drink
but
overall
it
is
a
very
unique
and
interesting
taste
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
very
smooth
and
the
different
flavors
blend
nicely
if
youve
never
had
this
get
it
i
think
yall
know
what
this
beer
is
about
i
lucked
into
a
sale
at
7
996
at
the
lowes
in
calabash
nc
on
12907
they
also
had
the
red
and
the
amber
on
sale
as
well
anyway
awesome
malty
flavor
with
a
strong
hoppy
kick
at
the
end
this
batch
was
in
6
pack
form
no
dates
whatsoever
on
the
packaging
so
i
have
no
idea
of
the
actual
production
date
the
last
time
i
found
this
was
in
bomber
form
in
cloudcroft
nm
a
coupla
yrs
ago
i
turned
some
of
my
bud
lite
friends
onto
this
and
they
loved
it
so
if
you
have
it
at
yr
local
groc
get
it
kill
if
you
must
have
a
nice
day
better
than
i
remember
poured
into
a
mug
as
dark
copper
with
a
nice
puffy
white
head
laced
the
glass
very
nicely
smell
is
slightly
fruity
nothing
special
though
tastes
light
almost
sweet
but
with
a
good
brew
appeal
the
sweetness
lasts
through
with
the
aftertaste
but
has
enough
kick
to
enjoy
i
like
it
a
good
rogue
product
a
lot
milder
than
i
had
anticipated
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
kick
in
the
pants
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
more
of
a
pat
on
the
butt
my
novice
palate
ignorantly
compares
it
to
an
india
pale
ale
but
the
flavor
profile
seemed
a
bit
more
refined
than
your
typical
ipa
subtle
notes
of
clove
apricot
and
honey
slightly
peppery
as
well
i
would
try
this
again
for
sure
perhaps
by
a
different
brewer
for
comparison
watch
the
high
abv
this
brew
is
so
smooth
it
can
creep
up
on
you
fast
very
drinkable
this
hybrid
bock
brewed
w
ale
yeast
is
intersting
and
a
damngood
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
fruity
sweet
and
balanced
hop
profile
makes
for
a
great
beer
a
regular
in
my
fridge
pours
copper
with
orange
tones
and
flecks
of
gold
and
red
small
yellowwhite
head
with
lightmedium
lacing
dies
down
quickly
aroma
of
bubblegum
banana
and
apple
with
floral
undertones
hints
of
spices
here
and
there
lightmedium
body
initial
flavor
is
a
mixture
of
rich
and
spicy
though
mild
noble
hops
and
sweet
flowery
cake
and
cookiedough
malts
punctuated
by
a
subtle
undertone
of
sour
lemonlime
citrus
followed
by
toasty
buttery
malts
underlined
by
mild
floral
and
dark
fruit
flavors
hops
linger
bready
somewhat
spicy
finish
and
aftertaste
dthe
malts
overwhelm
for
me
cutting
down
on
drinkability
all
in
all
a
good
drinking
beer
d
very
good
if
it
werent
for
my
aldh
deficiency
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
tastey
brew
that
would
be
lovely
to
session
ill
be
picking
up
more
for
sure
notes
ill
fess
up
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
and
what
exactly
this
beer
should
be
but
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
and
always
liked
it
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
my
first
rogue
and
my
first
maibock
hazy
deep
amber
color
sweet
malt
aroma
white
head
disapates
completely
initially
thought
that
this
was
very
malty
and
that
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
maltiness
but
realized
that
there
was
enough
hop
to
balance
it
all
out
it
was
suprisingly
good
and
actually
refreshing
even
throughout
the
temperature
change
i
will
definitely
be
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
strong
notes
of
caramel
and
honey
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
finish
due
to
the
hops
the
beer
is
balanced
but
leaning
toward
the
malty
side
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
creamy
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
if
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
overall
this
lager
is
a
nice
solid
brew
but
nothing
exceptional
in
my
opinion
note
disregard
the
placement
of
the
pts
in
the
score
all
i
could
say
was
hmmm
this
is
good
this
is
burp
good
d
not
my
favorite
rogue
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
this
ale
pours
a
nice
orangeamber
with
a
white
head
with
little
retention
it
smells
sweet
with
roasted
mail
notes
and
a
bit
of
bread
i
thought
i
picked
up
a
bit
of
honey
too
very
nice
the
taste
is
excellent
sweet
and
a
bit
floral
with
a
nice
sour
finish
very
rich
with
a
nice
thin
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
even
though
i
prefer
stouts
i
like
ipa
and
ales
too
this
one
ranks
pretty
well
to
me
the
head
dissapears
and
leaves
no
lacing
while
the
smell
is
a
little
old
and
dank
you
can
smell
an
slight
aromatic
lager
with
a
slight
clove
smell
to
it
the
taste
isnt
very
smooth
but
this
seems
to
be
an
old
bottle
the
taste
has
an
aftertaste
thats
a
little
off
putting
and
a
little
sour
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
seem
to
be
bad
or
good
overall
i
will
check
to
see
if
the
next
six
pack
i
buy
is
old
or
not
because
this
would
seemingly
be
great
when
its
fresh
i
will
try
it
again
pours
out
a
deep
garnet
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
thins
out
however
once
thinned
it
maintains
its
size
and
shape
smells
sweet
nutty
and
bready
with
a
whiff
of
floral
and
tealike
hops
theres
a
hint
of
jasmine
in
there
as
well
the
rich
maltiness
is
present
in
the
flavor
but
is
then
pushed
out
by
a
sturdy
hoppiness
floral
notes
and
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
i
get
a
slight
buttery
taste
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
body
is
slightly
light
a
bit
light
for
what
i
expected
but
the
carbonation
is
solid
extremely
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
foggy
orange
color
with
no
head
at
all
the
smell
on
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
baby
food
i
am
not
sure
about
you
but
that
is
not
something
i
want
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
taste
was
a
bitter
lemon
it
was
ok
but
was
a
little
too
bitter
at
times
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
felt
good
but
the
bitterness
is
too
overwhelming
at
times
the
drinkability
for
me
is
low
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bitter
beers
i
would
recomend
it
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
its
hearty
and
satisfying
and
its
quite
sessionable
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
refreshing
light
and
tasty
buy
a
halfgallon
of
this
beer
and
share
it
with
a
close
friend
you
will
not
be
disappointed
pours
dark
honey

a
two
finger

is
fruity
coffee
bready
lots
of
toasted
malt
up
front
slightly
fruity
slightly
bready
sweet
taste
with
a
nice
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
not
syrupy
with
nice
medium
carbonation
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
tasting
beer
hope
to
get
some
more
soon
smells
slightly
metallic
some
mild
spice
light
on
the
hops
not
to
much
going
on
here
malt
wise
honestly
rather
boring
the
taste
a
bit
better
although
not
by
much
a
very
mellow
flavor
its
not
very
dynamic
or
interesting
but
drinkable
non
the
less
i
feel
like
this
would
be
loads
better
on
tap
but
as
it
is
i
can
say
with
assuredness
i
will
never
buy
this
good
thing
i
didnt
in
the
first
place
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
nothing
special
maybe
with
a
greater
understanding
of
the
style
i
might
enjoy
this
more
but
until
that
day
ill
stay
way
not
sure
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
but
id
prefer
summits
maibock
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
one
overall
impression
this
was
one
of
the
first
micro
beer
bottles
i
have
ever
seen
back
in
1996
in
the
party
store
someone
said
dont
try
that
beer
its
disgusting
so
i
didnt
10
years
later
im
sampling
it
on
my
web
site
who
knew
a
delicious
maibock
i
would
call
it
a
session
beer
to
boot
very
clean
refreshing
and
delicate
if
you
dont
like
the
hop
flavor
or
hop
bitterness
even
just
a
bit
stick
to
those
american
or
premium
lagers
cheers
drinkability
overall
very
drinkable
but
i
tend
towards
bigger
flavors
nowadays
however
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
i
would
happily
drink
another
this
brew
poured
a
perfect
amber
pint
with
good
head
and
some
sticky
lace
great
sweet
malt
aromas
with
a
hint
of
hoppy
spice
the
flavor
is
great
big
malt
flavor
creamy
and
complex
with
a
perfectly
tasty
and
exotic
hop
profile
very
nice
smooth
as
silk
in
the
mouth
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
after
sampling
this
offering
ill
be
back
for
more
from
rogue
murky
dark
amber
body
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
malt
more
than
anything
tastes
malty
nutty
caramel
the
flavor
has
a
malted
milk
like
quality
to
it
on
the
heavy
side
of
mediumbodied
a
rather
good
tasty
brew
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
not
a
wow
beer
not
sure
what
it
is
about
this
brew
that
keeps
bringing
me
back
to
it
but
its
a
good
beer
and
pretty
much
the
only
rogue
ale
i
can
find
easiy
around
here
d
like
all
good
maibocks
you
can
put
a
few
of
these
down
eric
a
bit
too
highly
carbonated
for
my
tastes
and
not
very
drinkable
i
split
the
bomber
with
a
friend
and
probably
wouldnt
want
to
finish
a
whole
one
maybe
its
the
style
ill
have
to
try
some
other
examples
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
its
worth
a
try
taste
mouthfeel
drinkability
i
could
definetly
enjoy
this
one
as
a
daily
brew
and
have
enjoyed
sixpack
after
sixpack
over
the
years
always
a
good
call
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
im
really
not
familiar
with
the
style
so
i
cant
really
review
it
within
the
style
i
know
the
dead
skeleton
on
the
bottom
is
for
mays
day
of
the
dead
but
i
love
this
beer
in
the
winter
i
thought
the
graphic
depicted
exactly
this
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
the
skeleton
with
its
arms
crossed
sure
looks
like
it
is
freezing
on
top
of
a
nice
barrel
of
dead
guy
to
help
sustain
sanity
through
a
bone
chilling
night
plus
the
colors
in
the
background
look
like
the
northern
lights
and
youre
gonna
be
cold
if
you
see
those
if
not
hallucinatory
pours
a
deep
hazy
golden
color
with
modest
head
nice
malty
smell
taste
is
soo
good
nicely
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
so
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
complex
and
totally
enjoyable
taste
ive
had
this
before
in
bottles
seeing
the
growler
with
the
dead
guy
logo
was
too
much
to
resist
superbly
drinkable
my
daughter
and
i
polished
off
the
growler
with
my
hungover
soninlaw
declining
too
bad
it
was
a
bad
day
for
the
eagles
i
wasnt
sold
on
the
flavor
but
the
drinkability
on
top
of
this
flavor
is
what
saves
this
beer
and
makes
it
memorable
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
zippy
carbonation
smooth
not
my
favorite
style
but
pleasant
for
someone
who
loves
malts
and
the
complexities
of
malts
this
is
your
beer
little
hops
but
great
to
try
if
that
is
preference
i
recommend
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
nice
and
balanced
great
choice
the
mouth
is
medium
bodied
is
decently
carbonated
though
not
all
that
complex
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
out
of
the
bottle
often
on
tap
due
to
varying
amounts
of
carbonation
in
draft
lines
it
becomes
too
syrupy
its
an
easy
drinking
tasty
ale
even
if
not
the
most
complex
brew
pours
a
dark
coppery
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
last
long
it
has
a
fruityfloral
aroma
it
tastes
almost
like
an
ipa
but
not
as
strong
it
has
more
hop
bitterness
than
malt
sweetness
it
tastes
good
enough
that
i
want
to
drink
a
few
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
there
is
a
little
carbonation
on
the
tongue
not
the
best
ive
had
not
one
that
ill
buy
all
the
time
but
its
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
and
i
will
buy
some
again
sometime
12
oz
bottle
i
am
not
sure
how
i
missed
reviewing
this
but
anyway
pours
a
cloudy
copperhoney
color
off
white
fluffy
head
disappears
rather
quickly
nice
bready
spicy
aroma
bready
malt
flavor
a
bit
of
caramel
some
sweetness
complimented
by
floral
hops
very
smooth
a
little
yeasty
at
the
end
malt
is
the
showcase
here
some
spices
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
but
not
as
clean
as
i
would
think
for
the
style
enjoyable
it
pours
a
very
dark
orange
to
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
fruity
sweet
and
bitter
yet
very
alcoholy
as
for
the
taste
it
retains
that
bitter
and
sweet
taste
however
doesnt
quite
taste
as
alcoholsoaked
as
it
smells
but
it
wasnt
anything
that
made
me
say
thats
delicious
like
a
lot
of
other
rogue
beers
have
done
for
me
with
a
mouthful
thats
neither
thin
nor
thick
i
dont
think
many
people
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
many
of
these
unless
you
breathe
in
too
deeply
the
alcohol
scent
as
you
sip
for
me
it
tended
to
really
lower
the
quality
of
the
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
served
it
at
my
halloween
party
and
was
very
well
accepted
this
was
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
on
tap
locally
had
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
but
overall
recommended
found
myself
drinking
one
of
these
almost
every
other
day
lately
good
brew
this
poured
a
hazy
orangered
with
a
thick
head
that
left
very
nice
lacing
sweet
smell
of
malts
and
a
biscuity
aroma
a
very
nice
taste
of
fruits
hops
with
the
biscuity
flavoring
coming
into
the
background
complex
yet
smooth
and
refreshing
exceptional
a
good
well
balanced
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
smoothly
incredibly
drinkable
you
will
definitely
want
more
an
exceptional
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
yellow
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
smells
of
malt
and
a
little
fruit
honey
and
caramel
taste
is
of
malty
sweetness
initially
with
a
little
kick
of
hops
at
the
end
sort
of
an
iced
tea
like
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
drinkablity
is
pretty
good
pretty
solid
brew
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
dark
orangered
color
light
head
im
not
getting
too
much
aroma
flavors
are
subtle
this
is
a
fairly
sweet
beer
which
im
usually
not
that
fond
of
but
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
i
could
definitely
have
this
as
a
semiregular
beer
poored
from
the
bottle
with
weak
head
that
quickly
ran
away
the
color
was
murky
orange
almost
looks
like
an
unfiltered
homebrew
smell
is
hoppy
not
what
i
would
expect
here
the
taste
is
nearly
horrible
very
bitter
with
very
little
trace
of
malt
the
aftertaste
is
putrid
almost
vomitlike
sitting
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
was
very
disappointing
22oz
bomber
poured
in
a
pilsener
hazy
copperorange
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
faint
smell
of
malt
taste
is
interesting
malty
a
little
sweet
but
finishes
up
with
a
little
hoppiness
carbonation
seemed
to
disappear
a
little
too
quickly
smooth
mouthfeel
with
little
aftertaste
head
was
a
little
underdone
on
this
brew
the
color
was
fine
though
sort
of
orangegolden
and
it
was
rather
clear
the
aroma
was
nice
features
gold
robust
malt
manifesting
as
a
ripe
graininess
along
with
softer
caramel
notes
as
a
compliment
not
much
hops
detectable
to
me
and
i
also
dont
get
a
lot
of
fruitiness
which
is
a
little
odd
because
i
seem
to
recall
getting
more
fruitiness
from
past
samples
nevertheless
i
dont
smell
them
now
so
lets
continue
the
flavor
is
strongly
malty
at
the
start
and
has
some
nice
bitterness
for
balance
but
there
is
also
some
higher
alcohol
notes
that
do
not
seem
to
blend
or
compliment
the
other
characteristics
well
its
seems
rougher
rather
than
smoother
this
is
somewhat
detracting
and
i
dont
knmow
if
its
more
of
a
flavor
or
a
mouthfeel
issue
so
ill
hit
it
a
little
in
both
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
for
a
maibock
i
think
id
like
a
more
malty
smoother
delivery
if
indeed
however
its
not
a
maibock
id
still
have
to
ding
it
a
little
for
lack
of
smoothness
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
great
choice
to
go
with
a
nice
pork
roast
dinner
another
great
offering
from
a
very
good
brewery
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
it
yourself
overall
the
smell
alone
makes
this
a
must
try
a
bit
aggressive
on
the
palate
for
some
but
eccentrically
balanced
and
stands
out
beautifully
this
beer
settled
down
a
bit
as
it
warmed
but
it
was
still
quite
tough
to
drink
one
of
the
best
pints
ive
ever
enjoyed
was
a
dead
guy
ale
extremely
fresh
off
tap
at
the
san
fransisco
rogue
brewpub
it
was
so
malty
and
yet
so
hoppy
it
was
halloween
and
my
flight
had
just
arrived
in
earlier
that
day
we
watched
as
the
kids
trickortreated
and
the
bartenders
gave
them
candy
it
is
a
wonderful
memory
that
was
made
especially
extraordinary
in
thanks
to
the
wonderful
beer
itself
d
always
a
solid
choice
very
drinkable
crisp
pleasantly
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
a
recommended
beer
d
this
is
a
good
beer
it
has
a
nice
roasted
taste
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
it
feels
very
mellow
on
the
tongue
but
is
still
a
bit
filling
is
fine
as
a
session
beer
but
i
prefer
to
have
this
with
some
food
brew
pours
to
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
light
tan
head
which
had
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
off
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
of
sweet
malt
and
possibly
fruit
the
taste
is
defiantly
malt
which
leads
to
a
toasted
flavor
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
presence
that
is
noticeable
but
not
as
robust
as
the
maltyness
this
is
a
good
beer
not
a
favorite
but
defiantly
a
solid
choice
if
available
i
will
always
think
about
getting
one
the
classic
dead
guy
bomber
pours
a
hazy
rubyamber
with
offwhite
head
smells
of
sweet
fruity
amber
malts
tastes
of
caramel
malts
with
a
bit
of
esters
and
little
bitterness
at
the
end
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
although
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
hot
at
times
very
drinkable
give
me
a
keg
a
solid
beer
i
just
had
it
from
the
wild
onion
in
wayne
pa
ontap
it
had
a
nice
color
yet
not
that
much
smell
there
was
not
much
head
and
and
a
touch
of
lace
the
head
had
low
retention
the
taste
was
bitter
and
not
over
powering
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
dead
guy
ale
is
very
drinkable
a
nice
malty
marzen
with
plenty
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
profile
along
with
a
slight
nuttiness
hops
are
subtle
but
do
make
an
appearance
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
good
session
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
that
wont
wear
out
the
palette
overall
a
nice
beer
with
very
good
drinkability
recommended
da
this
one
wasnt
as
great
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
still
easily
drinkable
taste
was
another
matter
the
first
taste
was
sweetish
there
was
a
rather
complex
combination
a
flavors
in
the
midpalate
and
the
finish
was
dry
and
good
the
brew
has
malt
sweetness
balanced
with
indistinct
hop
bitterness
some
flavor
notes
of
grass
and
maybe
a
touch
of
lime
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
some
maltstickiness
all
in
all
the
drinkability
was
good
which
is
nice
because
ive
got
a
sixpack
of
it
to
sample
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
draft
version
will
go
back
to
it
any
when
the
chance
arises
pours
with
a
nice
orange
color
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
hops
and
fruit
taste
wonderful
hints
of
fruit
nice
strong
hop
flavor
nice
bread
taste
as
well
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
mouth
feel
is
oily
and
nicely
carbonated
great
beer
nicely
priced
very
drinkable
d
definitely
enjoyable
offering
id
have
a
few
backtoback
for
its
balanced
complexity
of
taste
poured
a
rouge
dead
guy
ale
into
my
tasting
glass
it
has
a
very
orange
color
with
nice
creamy
head
that
turns
into
lacing
after
about
10
seconds
the
nose
slightly
hoppy
as
with
the
taste
i
could
drink
a
few
in
a
session
i
am
not
overy
impressed
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
a
good
standby
beer
and
would
make
a
great
session
in
an
oregon
taproom
overlooking
the
pacific
and
some
big
mfing
redwoods
this
beer
is
definately
on
the
short
list
of
what
to
keep
on
hand
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
mellow
malty
aroma
is
very
inviting
and
appealing
big
malty
taste
with
a
subtle
spicy
hoppiness
lingers
on
the
palate
for
some
length
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
relax
with
for
a
bit
wavz
i
poured
this
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
and
a
shocked
by
the
nearly
pumpkin
hue
that
the
brew
has
little
to
no
head
with
slight
patches
of
lacing
both
in
smell
and
taste
a
bit
citrusy
orange
to
it
slight
bitterness
with
a
great
mouthfeel
that
really
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
really
make
the
beer
soft
on
the
pallate
great
beer
drinkability
is
great
too
really
enjoying
this
one
and
looking
forward
to
more
d
not
what
id
call
a
refreshing
beer
although
the
hoppiness
helps
a
bit
in
that
regard
a
heavy
boozy
drink
but
with
some
complexity
a
very
slight
alcoholic
taste
for
a
6
5
beer
overall
a
good
beer
the
smell
is
nice
and
sweet
which
fits
in
well
with
the
slightly
fruity
taste
the
mouthful
is
nice
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
find
myself
going
back
to
this
one
quite
a
bit
drinkability
very
much
so
ongoing
a
greatly
crafted
brew
anywhere
i
go
and
they
have
it
on
draft
i
get
it
but
it
is
dangerous
on
draft
you
wont
realize
how
much
you
had
until
you
look
hazily
i
might
add
at
your
bill
be
careful
with
this
one
this
one
has
grown
on
me
over
the
years
while
i
dont
think
its
particularly
complex
it
is
quite
delicious
and
a
beer
i
keep
on
hand
frequently
overall
a
fine
brew
another
classic
from
the
folks
at
rogue
good
stuff
glad
to
see
some
quality
brews
available
here
for
a
change
pours
a
gorgeous
orange
brown
the
head
is
a
creamy
white
and
leaves
a
lacing
against
the
glass
on
each
consecutive
sip
theres
a
hint
of
some
sort
of
exotic
fruit
in
the
drink
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spices
the
taste
is
crisp
although
not
lacking
in
any
sort
of
complexity
the
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
and
is
fairly
smooth
drinkability
is
outstanding
d
i
could
drink
a
whole
6
pack
easily
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
is
the
abv
at
6
5
its
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
d
this
is
odd
its
labeled
an
ale
yet
pretty
clearly
is
not
an
ale
its
a
pretty
big
flavorful
lager
though
so
the
alelager
categories
dont
really
matter
much
its
really
easy
to
drink
a
damn
fine
beer
slowly
gets
more
delightful
as
it
warms
lending
more
complexity
with
each
sip
its
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
this
is
quite
a
brew
the
maltiness
is
great
it
could
definately
pass
for
a
great
winter
brew
so
very
tasty
cheers
wow
this
is
just
a
winner
all
the
way
around
i
cant
find
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
great
brew
from
rogue
it
looks
great
has
a
great
bottle
the
name
is
badass
what
are
you
drinking
rogue
dead
guy
ale
whoa
dont
fck
with
that
dude
it
smells
heavenly
tastes
like
liquid
gold
and
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
amazing
drinkability
very
sessionable
i
was
never
sure
what
type
of
style
this
was
its
a
pretty
unique
taste
well
made
and
one
that
i
revisit
often
this
was
the
first
craft
beer
i
remember
having
and
really
enjoying
long
time
ago
it
seems
its
widely
available
here
we
see
it
everywhere
now
even
krogers
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
brew
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
fruitiness
blended
with
a
wonderful
oily
hoppiness
and
mellow
and
raw
background
malt
character
what
a
supberb
brew
rogue
has
crafted
with
this
one
a
job
very
well
done
and
a
highly
recommended
brew
its
always
good
to
find
a
reliably
excellent
beer
and
rogues
dead
guy
ale
is
one
of
them
for
those
of
us
who
love
hops
this
is
a
fabulous
break
an
opportunity
to
splash
in
a
beer
full
of
malty
goodness
rich
butterscotch
deeply
sweet
aroma
chewy
mouthfeel
slightly
bitter
smooth
the
sort
of
beer
that
as
it
goes
down
your
throat
leaves
an
almost
magnetic
attraction
for
the
next
bottle
in
the
six
pack
i
dont
love
every
beer
in
rogues
lineup
but
when
they
get
it
right
they
get
it
right
i
have
never
been
disappointed
by
this
beer
drinkability
with
the
alcohol
coming
through
so
much
it
makes
it
one
that
i
would
have
one
and
move
on
to
something
else
an
odd
taste
but
not
bad
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
in
general
and
certainly
one
of
my
faves
for
the
maibock
style
relatively
easy
to
find
this
is
probably
rogues
most
popular
brew
and
its
one
they
do
extremely
well
and
one
that
i
like
to
enjoy
quite
often
very
sweet
medium
bodied
ale
good
balance
of
hops
great
example
of
its
style
though
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
maibock
this
particular
brew
was
well
worth
the
time
i
spent
drinking
it
down
during
happy
hour
at
the
mews
in
wakefield
ri
the
head
disolves
quickly
but
with
a
sweet
beer
such
as
this
you
dont
miss
it
much
the
beer
pours
a
deep
goldcopper
color
you
can
tell
by
the
smell
its
gonna
have
a
bite
medium
amount
of
bubbles
that
settle
to
a
blotchy
thin
head
faint
lacing
strong
hoppy
taste
especially
the
finish
leaves
a
dry
bitter
taste
the
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
work
well
together
i
was
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
dvery
good
i
would
like
to
buy
a
case
of
this
this
is
my
2nd
time
drinking
this
stuff
i
love
the
honey
taste
in
it
and
it
goes
down
real
smooth
but
watch
out
after
a
few
you
begin
to
feel
the
buzz
well
done
rogue
p
s
we
will
miss
you
cindy
good
luck
with
your
new
job
this
was
a
really
nice
peach
color
with
a
red
tint
but
the
slight
head
collapsed
quickly
and
left
no
trace
aroma
of
sweet
malts
with
blueberries
lurking
in
the
background
a
big
coffee
taste
slightly
burnt
and
a
metallic
trace
are
the
primary
flavors
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
the
taste
could
have
been
fresher
i
thought
and
the
slightly
chalky
finish
reduced
the
drinkability
but
its
still
pretty
good
and
i
loved
that
blueberry
touch
this
beer
pours
amber
brown
with
a
light
head
the
head
on
my
beer
died
fairly
quick
the
smell
is
a
clean
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
surprising
it
starts
a
sweet
fruity
malt
with
a
bit
of
a
raspberry
flavor
the
beer
has
a
clean
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
spice
this
beer
is
clean
and
smooth
without
much
of
a
hard
bite
at
all
its
well
blended
and
goes
down
smooth
over
all
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
i
had
never
had
it
before
this
tasting
and
it
caught
me
off
guard
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
notesthis
was
a
very
tasty
beer
id
certainly
recommend
it
all
in
all
quite
a
good
brew
my
first
review
of
a
maibock
but
not
my
first
time
drinking
a
dead
guy
wont
be
my
last
either
the
drinkability
is
high
now
i
see
this
is
not
hype
this
is
quite
a
good
hybrid
beer
prosit
mk
this
is
a
favorite
all
the
time
beer
along
with
kentucky
ale
this
is
usually
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
and
one
of
those
beers
i
typically
reach
for
after
work
not
a
special
or
extreme
option
but
a
damn
nice
beer
regardless
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
what
this
beer
is
all
about
though
feels
smooth
and
finishes
smooth
a
tiny
bit
bitter
but
makes
you
want
more
dead
guy
was
one
of
the
first
good
beers
that
made
me
realize
i
need
to
explore
the
beer
world
more
its
rich
complex
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
a
solid
craft
beer
this
is
simply
a
great
beer
maybe
the
absolute
best
that
can
be
found
in
most
supermarkets
anywhere
in
the
country
the
color
is
very
nice
but
what
little
head
there
is
disappears
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
faint
but
sweet
taste
is
nice
and
malty
and
has
a
tea
like
quality
the
tea
like
quality
gets
stronger
as
it
warms
up
best
to
keep
it
cool
the
real
strength
is
its
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
tasty
enough
to
want
more
drinkable
with
ale
tendencies
as
i
read
they
use
an
ale
yeast
some
bitterness
present
malty
back
taste
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
very
enjoyable
brew
notes
this
is
a
unique
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
i
really
enjoy
it
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
stand
up
great
with
a
heavy
meal
or
as
an
evening
sipper
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
has
a
copperorange
color
to
it
and
not
much
of
a
head
to
the
beer
it
smells
like
malt
apricots
and
caramel
its
a
sweet
aroma
it
tastes
like
yeasty
bread
sweet
malt
apricots
and
other
citrus
fruit
it
tastes
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
but
it
finshes
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
little
slick
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
with
the
beer
being
very
smooth
and
crisp
i
could
drink
this
pretty
often
its
another
great
beer
from
rogue
drinkability
i
reached
for
a
second
one
real
soon
after
the
first
very
sessionable
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
the
consistency
on
dead
guy
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
i
think
it
is
due
more
to
an
age
storage
issue
rather
than
a
brewery
issue
this
was
a
good
bottle
very
drinkable
i
had
4
last
night
the
6
5
abv
could
sneak
up
on
you
though
if
youre
not
careful
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
rustic
orange
with
a
one
head
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
some
warm
fresh
bread
just
taken
out
of
the
oven
with
a
hint
of
a
citrus
flair
taste
is
of
yeasty
bread
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
that
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
very
well
very
well
put
together
and
tasty
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
very
nicely
balanced
another
great
offering
from
the
good
guys
at
rogue
the
appearance
is
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
of
bread
with
some
fruit
the
taste
confirms
the
smell
with
some
homemade
bread
flavors
and
some
fruit
like
apple
and
mango
there
is
a
nice
hop
balance
that
makes
for
far
above
average
drinkability
great
stuff
dits
different
very
sweet
and
i
think
might
be
a
good
transition
beer
rogue
one
again
doesnt
disappoint
i
would
have
this
again
dead
guy
ale
pours
a
honey
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
nice
malty
aroma
nice
spicy
hoppy
flavor
with
a
good
malt
backbone
very
quaffable
its
been
quite
a
long
time
since
ive
had
one
of
these
and
i
have
to
say
im
not
disappointed
in
the
least
recommended
d
as
i
see
it
this
is
the
perfect
beer
its
good
in
the
summer
winter
and
any
occasion
this
has
been
a
staple
in
my
fridge
since
i
first
had
it
this
was
served
on
tap
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
light
orange
amber
color
with
low
carbonation
little
head
and
minimal
lacing
smalty
citrus
dominates
with
a
hint
of
spice
maybe
even
cinnamon
t
starts
medium
body
with
enough
hop
punch
at
the
finish
to
be
crisp
and
clean
m
moderately
thin
but
enough
to
represent
the
style
d
very
refreshing
and
not
overly
filling
a
definite
session
beer
yet
another
winner
from
the
good
folks
rogue
very
easy
and
pleasurable
to
drink
substantial
enough
to
be
satisfied
with
one
if
you
can
control
yourself
because
its
tasty
and
crisp
enough
to
easily
turn
this
into
a
session
brew
gotta
get
me
a
jug
of
this
sometime
will
come
back
for
more
d
very
good
rogue
shows
again
why
it
is
held
in
such
esteem
by
beer
geeks
the
beer
pours
a
medium
orangeamber
with
an
inch
of
head
i
smell
carmel
malts
and
a
twinge
of
hop
bitterness
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
and
balance
there
is
a
slight
citrus
flavor
in
the
hops
as
well
it
might
not
be
a
true
maibock
but
i
dont
care
this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
had
it
for
the
first
time
the
day
i
turned
21
and
thought
it
was
the
best
beer
of
the
mix
six
i
got
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
if
it
wasnt
10
or
more
a
six
pack
d
on
a
summer
day
i
could
sip
these
till
the
sun
goes
down
inasanely
refreshing
and
all
the
tastes
meld
with
nothing
standing
out
nice
smooth
taste
with
a
great
balance
between
the
thick
and
flavorful
malt
and
the
bittering
hops
not
a
standout
in
any
one
area
but
a
good
all
around
beer
very
sippable
beer
i
ordered
this
after
a
long
day
of
work
and
you
couldnt
ask
for
the
better
ending
to
the
day
overall
a
fairly
hoppy
beer
although
its
balanced
nicely
by
elements
of
sweet
and
the
light
creaminess
would
definitely
recommend
it
all
around
a
very
almost
painstakingly
balanced
brew
definitely
worth
keeping
this
one
in
heavy
rotation
it
was
entertaining
to
see
my
friends
at
dinner
immediately
gravitate
to
the
appearence
of
this
beer
after
i
poured
a
pint
for
myself
they
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
asked
where
more
could
be
found
i
very
much
like
to
drink
this
beer
during
the
summer
whether
at
the
bar
from
the
tap
or
at
bbqs
it
has
a
very
light
taste
to
it
and
a
nice
hop
finish
it
clears
your
palette
when
you
are
are
having
heavy
foods
but
it
hasnt
overpowered
anything
ive
eaten
very
tasty
beer
with
a
simply
excellent
aftertaste
to
me
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
can
see
how
it
wouldnt
be
to
others
good
stuff
this
one
poured
with
high
thin
carbonation
the
bubbles
dissipated
with
a
ferocious
quickness
the
smell
was
sweet
malty
with
some
hops
in
the
backround
this
one
tasted
like
some
european
beers
ive
had
recently
with
american
hops
added
for
bite
delicious
sweet
malt
and
hops
fight
in
a
tug
a
war
in
your
mouth
with
no
apparent
winner
a
medium
mouthfeel
left
my
mouth
sticky
after
swallow
more
typical
of
your
heavy
mouthfeel
beers
the
medium
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
sticky
aftertaste
meant
i
definately
wanted
one
more
after
i
was
done
making
the
drinkability
excellent
another
unique
beer
from
one
of
the
most
unique
breweries
in
the
nation
well
done
rogue
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
la
terrible
wonderful
good
example
of
the
style
definitely
recommended
a
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
definatly
restock
up
on
it
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
white
lace
it
had
a
very
sweet
smell
to
it
hops
and
malts
were
both
equally
present
with
small
hints
of
sweetness
and
maybe
even
some
fruitiness
it
tasted
good
and
was
very
smooth
and
refreshing
again
the
malts
and
hops
were
very
present
malty
sweetness
and
even
slightly
fruity
it
was
a
very
good
tasting
beer
that
was
as
enjoyable
as
it
was
unique
rated
on
the
12
oz
bottle
but
have
enjoyed
bomber
as
well
poured
to
a
hazy
reddishorange
with
one
finger
whitetan
head
that
lingered
this
was
a
very
active
beer
as
carbonation
bubbles
continued
to
work
the
entire
drink
aroma
of
fruit
apples
and
malt
with
hops
present
bitterness
combined
with
the
fruit
created
a
very
good
flavor
and
finish
alcohols
presence
became
more
apparent
near
the
end
even
more
so
in
the
bomber
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
had
a
nice
smell
of
malt
though
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
a
good
toasted
malt
flavor
that
sits
on
the
tongue
a
while
and
dissipates
slowly
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
pretty
good
without
being
too
much
i
understand
that
this
beer
is
somewhat
of
a
session
brew
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
may
get
tired
of
the
flavor
d
bummer
the
carbonation
was
screwed
up
ive
drank
this
enough
to
know
what
the
carbonation
should
be
like
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
pairs
very
well
with
food
this
beer
pours
an
light
amber
with
very
little
white
head
smell
and
taste
are
hard
to
distinguish
smells
of
malts
and
sweet
tones
taste
is
similar
this
beer
is
best
on
tap
i
didnt
find
it
as
inviting
when
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
it
is
a
hard
beer
to
describe
but
is
very
good
i
recommend
this
one
to
everyone
it
is
middle
of
the
road
with
some
great
flavor
the
balance
is
amazing
a
good
deal
of
flavor
that
works
well
together
i
could
have
these
all
the
time
cheers
i
dont
care
if
this
is
a
real
maibock
or
not
its
just
a
damn
good
beer
and
one
that
combines
some
tastes
that
are
usually
not
together
great
name
great
bottle
great
beer
moderately
high
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
medium
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
of
good
size
appears
lightly
carbonated
nose
is
malt
upfront
with
some
subtle
hop
background
has
a
pleasant
floral
scent
as
well
palate
is
very
malty
but
carries
a
strong
hop
bitterness
that
offsets
it
well
some
sweet
mollasses
or
honey
flavors
are
present
as
well
more
a
sit
warms
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
this
one
and
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
over
all
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
bock
with
a
discernable
hop
presence
not
among
my
favorite
styles
but
a
good
one
when
im
in
the
mood
recommended
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
out
of
a
growler
from
frugal
macdougals
in
nashville
it
was
a
bit
warm
around
65
but
it
actually
seemed
to
bring
out
more
flavor
and
nose
i
was
really
impressed
by
it
when
slightly
warm
it
seemed
like
there
was
a
much
more
complex
taste
to
it
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
brown
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
ales
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
i
have
a
renewed
love
for
this
one
after
this
bottle
a
natural
quaffer
here
all
quality
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
cant
wait
until
i
can
try
it
on
tap
d
also
medium
probably
too
bitter
for
some
i
like
it
very
much
dark
copper
and
light
head
catch
the
visual
senses
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
defiantly
bitter
but
in
a
good
way
followed
by
spices
and
as
mentioned
a
noticeable
alcohol
taste
i
enjoy
this
as
a
after
dinner
beer
as
the
flavor
can
over
power
most
meals
not
a
bad
brew
a
little
thick
and
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
knocking
back
a
handful
of
these
without
a
whole
lot
of
experience
with
the
style
id
say
its
a
heckuva
maibock
the
more
i
try
of
this
beer
the
more
i
keep
thinking
its
almost
like
a
light
barleywine
it
has
a
lot
of
the
same
hallmark
flavors
but
less
pronounced
the
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
someone
trying
to
turn
an
old
ruffian
into
a
session
beer
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
poured
a
light
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
color
is
golden
amber
with
a
light
haze
wonderful
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
no
hops
moderate
hop
bitterness
hits
you
first
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
finish
with
a
touch
of
raosty
dark
malt
beer
has
good
body
and
feels
creamy
on
the
palate
overall
a
very
good
maibockale
drinkability
it
is
smooth
with
a
great
balance
of
flavor
i
am
still
very
interested
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
and
i
may
buy
it
again
and
that
says
a
lot
i
had
a
few
of
these
after
mowing
the
lawn
and
it
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
in
my
quest
for
the
perfect
warm
weather
beer
this
doesnt
do
the
trick
as
it
warms
i
think
it
tends
to
get
a
little
better
with
the
harsh
tastes
rounding
out
a
little
as
you
go
drinkability
a
spot
filling
without
a
particularly
elite
flavor
these
factors
detract
some
from
the
drinkability
however
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
and
in
a
sense
classic
beer
ill
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
dead
guy
also
it
comes
in
a
pretty
damn
cool
bottle
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
clear
bronzed
caramel
body
with
a
few
beads
of
carbonation
leading
up
to
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
consists
of
pale
and
toasted
malts
with
some
sweetcaramel
qualities
the
body
is
medium
and
prickly
at
the
start
revealing
caramel
toasty
sweet
bubblegum
malts
with
a
mild
hop
bite
and
leaving
a
medium
finish
pretty
good
but
rogue
brews
better
beers
that
id
rather
buy
one
of
my
favourite
styles
and
im
excited
to
try
this
maibock
from
rogue
came
in
a
6pack
of
330ml
bottles
with
the
lovely
skeleton
on
the
barrel
label
a
solidlooking
beer
in
the
glass
icedtea
colour
with
a
generous
cap
of
tight
dullwhite
head
good
full
sheets
of
lacing
the
beer
can
appear
light
orange
as
well
as
dull
rustyred
a
swell
looking
maibock
onto
the
more
important
aroma
the
first
scent
i
get
is
spicy
nuttiness
like
eggnog
with
nutmeg
excellent
malts
with
full
notes
of
toffee
and
vanilla
wafer
and
some
sourish
bready
notes
very
creamy
smelling
with
a
spritziness
that
could
be
the
alcohol
or
the
hops
the
hops
are
complementing
the
malting
well
adding
some
dry
earthy
musky
smells
i
get
a
lot
of
sweetish
vanilla
and
even
maple
lots
of
tree
bark
and
caramel
with
the
bitterness
of
tea
bready
roasted
and
warming
not
hugely
complex
but
done
very
well
for
the
style
with
emphasis
on
the
rich
malts
a
respectable
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
the
flowery
aftertaste
of
german
hops
butterscotch
and
raisins
with
some
white
sugar
undertones
a
little
hardwater
in
the
middle
of
the
mouth
making
the
body
feel
a
little
thin
at
times
honey
and
strong
toffee
flavours
in
the
beer
with
lots
of
buttered
toast
and
wholegrain
bread
tastes
besides
the
tiniest
watery
sensation
the
taste
is
stellar
for
a
bock
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
medium
carbonation
and
little
alcoholic
burn
medium
bodied
going
down
easily
with
all
the
haveanother
character
you
could
want
in
a
bock
solid
thanks
rogue
prickly
on
the
tip
of
the
tounge
a
pleasant
ammount
of
carbonation
that
settles
out
by
the
time
it
gets
to
the
back
for
a
crisp
and
smooth
finish
the
hops
and
malt
comingled
at
the
start
of
each
sip
but
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
emerged
near
the
back
end
the
aftertaste
was
distinctly
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
were
a
little
thin
but
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
quality
brew
d
not
awful
but
ill
make
a
point
to
avoid
this
in
the
future
it
isnt
undrinkable
but
it
is
far
from
desirable
the
pilsneresque
grassyness
suggests
that
it
might
be
good
with
some
foods
but
i
am
not
sure
what
where
i
live
this
costs
48
a
case
its
worth
it
with
an
exceptionally
rich
taste
but
light
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
taste
is
an
even
blend
of
bitter
fruit
smoke
and
hops
it
is
sweet
but
earthy
heavy
carbonation
adds
to
its
bite
a
versatile
four
season
beer
that
can
go
along
with
your
dinner
or
serve
as
a
session
beer
during
the
red
sox
game
very
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
thank
goodness
they
are
easy
to
come
by
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
amber
color
but
it
has
a
weak
head
which
doesnt
last
very
long
this
particular
bottle
was
clear
but
it
has
been
cloudy
every
now
and
then
i
like
the
very
unique
smell
of
this
beer
ive
never
really
smelt
a
beer
like
it
it
has
a
full
aroma
that
smells
malty
to
me
the
taste
follows
the
smell
in
fullness
it
also
has
a
nice
lever
of
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
citrus
there
is
a
nice
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
very
thick
taste
the
beer
does
however
leave
a
lingering
bitter
taste
in
your
mouth
which
i
dont
mind
overall
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
even
with
its
slightly
high
alcohol
content
i
would
definitely
drink
several
in
a
row
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
come
by
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
hasnt
tried
it
i
am
curious
how
this
ale
wound
up
classified
as
a
bock
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
could
see
this
as
killer
session
beer
if
im
in
that
mood
i
know
its
a
maibockhelles
bock
and
it
surely
has
all
those
qualities
but
honestly
it
doesnt
fit
right
into
that
mold
its
so
much
more
and
just
very
nice
d
pretty
good
session
brew
nothing
really
stands
out
and
grabbed
me
with
this
one
though
this
beers
made
for
sessioning
the
light
sweetness
and
easy
feel
were
really
easy
to
drink
its
6
5
but
i
look
forward
to
getting
the
little
prepackaged
growler
and
drinking
it
myself
at
a
future
social
gathering
nice
beer
dead
guys
ale
is
nothing
like
ive
ever
tasted
its
an
odd
tasting
beer
but
in
a
very
nice
way
glad
its
in
town
now
very
drinkable
and
the
bottle
is
cool
too
excellent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
despite
the
high
alcohol
i
could
spend
the
whole
afternoon
with
this
great
beer
drinkability
interesting
style
unique
and
nothing
like
it
great
beer
craft
brewer
drinkability
isnt
too
high
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
and
too
sweet
for
me
orange
color
with
one
finger
off
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
film
immediately
smell
of
bread
orange
peel
faint
alcohol
the
bready
biscuity
flavor
is
what
dominates
for
me
though
some
faint
earthy
hoppiness
taste
follows
suit
very
bready
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
chewy
and
full
bodied
finishes
with
some
bitterness
but
on
the
earthy
side
overall
an
above
average
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
a
lot
worth
trying
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
to
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
to
get
it
a
really
good
beer
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
orange
head
off
first
pour
is
about
half
inch
and
hands
in
there
for
a
while
subsequent
pours
little
head
leaves
no
lacing
first
smell
is
citrusy
and
hops
taste
is
balanced
with
some
hops
bitterness
but
a
slightly
malty
flavor
very
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
i
had
it
with
my
easter
ham
dinner
and
it
is
a
good
complement
to
food
it
would
also
be
a
good
session
beer
taking
the
6
5
abv
into
account
i
did
not
pour
this
beer
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
so
the
color
was
unknown
to
me
however
this
seems
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
you
really
just
sit
and
enjoy
not
one
to
be
drank
fast
but
to
savor
the
flavor
i
liked
the
strong
yet
mild
taste
of
this
beer
i
would
recomend
trying
this
beer
at
least
once
pours
a
nice
midorange
amber
color
with
a
big
two
fingered
head
malty
nose
with
hints
of
breadiness
and
slight
citrus
head
sticks
around
througout
with
good
lacing
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
sticky
bready
taste
rounded
out
with
citrus
and
dark
fruit
flavors
raisin
possibly
easy
to
drink
and
decpetively
strong
in
abv
mouthfeel
is
full
and
bubbly
oily
a
nice
feel
overall
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
ever
though
i
could
see
being
in
the
mood
for
this
from
time
to
time
not
great
not
bad
worth
a
try
glowinthedark
bottle
gets
extra
points
for
appearance
this
is
a
darker
orange
colored
beer
with
a
relatively
weak
head
on
top
very
grainy
and
salty
smell
to
it
not
all
that
aromatic
has
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
im
not
really
sure
what
type
of
hops
this
beer
uses
but
they
are
quite
delicious
the
maltieness
is
the
major
note
and
reminds
me
of
a
hearty
bread
but
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
hops
it
is
clean
and
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
offering
from
rogue
a
bottle
from
our
friday
bio
meeting
pours
orangeybrown
nice
white
head
bubbly
odor
is
kind
of
citrusy
and
earthy
a
bit
like
oranges
taste
is
malty
and
crisp
good
hop
flavor
not
too
powerful
some
alcohol
on
the
edges
that
is
almost
but
not
quite
unsettling
actually
i
think
the
alcohol
taste
is
tamped
down
to
some
extent
by
the
citrusy
hop
flavor
smooth
and
eminiently
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
first
try
of
rogues
flagship
beer
and
im
impressed
light
amber
in
colour
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
lots
of
carbonation
very
malty
aroma
and
flavor
with
some
minor
caramel
and
orange
notes
theres
a
bit
of
roasted
grain
nuttiness
on
the
finish
as
well
i
detected
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
bitterness
but
this
is
one
doesnt
seem
nearly
as
hoppy
or
as
complex
as
other
rogue
products
that
ive
sampled
solid
but
unspectacular
pours
a
warm
copper
with
an
off
white
head
smells
biscuity
a
strong
malty
base
with
mild
hops
and
citrus
not
much
nose
to
this
one
taste
is
very
balanced
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
hop
finish
a
very
solid
session
ale
i
could
definately
down
a
lot
of
these
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
dry
finish
the
flavor
was
good
but
i
dont
think
id
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
row
bottle
purchased
at
whole
foods
chicago
a
bit
of
a
surprise
since
i
did
not
know
what
style
this
was
a
flagship
beer
from
a
northwestern
brewer
thats
not
full
of
hops
so
be
it
big
malt
smell
upon
opening
and
pouring
almost
like
malt
candy
a
lovely
brown
body
under
a
cream
colored
head
great
taste
of
caramel
malts
and
something
that
must
be
honey
that
cant
help
but
overpower
any
hop
bill
big
caramel
and
toffee
malt
finish
d
this
beer
lacks
a
whole
lot
of
drinkability
nice
brew
to
style
making
it
a
very
sessionable
malt
refresher
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
probably
would
not
buy
it
but
i
would
drink
it
again
smooth
refreshing
nice
bottle
i
have
my
old
time
male
friends
who
know
nothing
about
beer
but
drink
this
just
because
of
the
look
of
the
bottle
interesting
what
we
men
do
the
mouthfeel
is
full
coats
your
mouth
with
malty
goodness
but
not
to
thick
bottle
erupts
a
clear
amber
with
a
frothy
bubbly
head
that
recedes
slowly
aromas
are
sweet
and
malty
though
there
isnt
much
coming
out
mildly
spicy
with
little
hops
detected
the
flavor
is
pretty
clean
sweet
malty
no
hops
tasted
a
bit
alcoholic
at
the
end
body
is
weak
slightly
watery
a
little
dissapointed
with
this
as
most
rogues
seem
very
good
very
clean
somewhat
refreshing
though
this
caramel
bite
is
halfhearted
one
and
im
done
pours
a
reddishorange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
floral
hoppy
aroma
bready
slghtly
caramel
flavor
with
some
citrus
notes
very
very
smooth
medium
bodied
and
moderatelytohighly
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
incredibly
drinkable
a
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
super
drinkable
to
me
even
with
the
price
so
crazy
high
its
worth
it
pours
a
deep
slightly
cloudy
copper
with
a
large
goldentan
head
that
is
slow
to
dissipate
and
leaves
good
lacing
and
a
large
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
with
some
plum
and
alcohol
and
floral
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
a
bit
of
yeast
and
bread
are
also
apparent
taste
is
lightly
hoppy
with
plent
of
malt
underlying
it
caramel
and
butter
come
through
with
some
dark
fruitiness
lying
just
beneath
it
plum
and
pear
are
noticible
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
crisp
very
full
and
satisfying
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
nice
ale
interesting
twist
on
a
maibock
equally
good
on
a
crisp
fall
day
or
at
the
beginning
of
spring
overall
sure
the
label
will
make
you
buy
it
but
the
flavor
will
keep
you
coming
back
i
really
like
this
beer
for
the
flavors
it
pits
against
one
another
drinkability
is
hurt
by
sweetness
and
relatively
high
alcohol
content
its
good
stuff
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
i
couldnt
take
more
than
a
few
of
these
kewl
skeleton
holding
a
pint
sitting
atop
cask
of
rogue
ale
on
my
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
hazy
dark
orangehoney
color
with
a
half
inch
off
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
layer
smell
is
malty
and
on
the
sweet
side
with
light
honey
sweet
fruit
aromas
of
papaya
and
bit
of
hops
taste
is
also
kinda
sweet
the
4
malts
make
it
nice
and
rich
bit
of
honey
sweetness
then
the
hops
come
in
and
clean
up
the
finish
leaving
a
slighly
bittersweet
and
grainy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
mmn
tasty
and
very
drinkable
would
love
to
session
this
maibock
exciting
flavor
profile
for
a
style
that
can
easily
be
pretty
bland
and
wheatheavy
a
very
well
rounded
offering
from
rogue
highly
drinkable
this
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
rogue
brewers
many
a
year
ago
gratefully
dedicated
i
know
its
a
coincidence
but
thats
still
pretty
cool
very
drinkable
i
can
certainly
recommend
drinkability
taste
is
pretty
good
stays
consistent
throughout
isnt
too
thin
and
has
a
reasonable
abv
so
overall
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
if
you
options
are
limited
the
body
has
a
medium
feel
carbonation
seems
a
little
low
but
still
a
easy
drinking
i
dont
think
i
would
kill
anyone
for
it
but
you
never
know
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
this
beer
it
is
good
really
good
the
malt
richness
of
this
beer
is
not
so
overwhelming
maybe
ill
have
another
i
wish
i
could
taste
this
straight
from
the
tap
overall
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
and
relax
with
very
obliging
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
got
a
pretty
subtle
alcohol
punch
to
it
with
the
hop
sedative
effects
id
take
it
easy
with
this
one
its
a
distinct
departure
from
the
bock
styles
ive
had
before
and
i
look
forward
to
exploring
the
style
more
a
very
nice
brew
all
around
poured
into
a
20
oz
pint
glass
with
a
orangecopper
color
with
an
of
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
nice
aroma
of
citrus
and
spice
comes
through
on
the
first
scent
then
there
is
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
the
taste
starts
with
the
malt
followed
by
a
mellow
hop
flavor
with
citrus
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
slightly
heavy
and
has
nice
dry
finish
at
the
end
the
taste
is
well
balanced
this
can
be
a
go
to
beer
when
you
can
find
nothing
you
like
at
the
store
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
but
not
bad
being
a
may
beer
it
might
actually
be
better
on
a
sunny
may
day
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
sweet
tasting
ale
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
pours
a
cloudy

not

much
carbination
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
fruitmint
taste
in
the
finish
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
better
than
it
looks
or
smells
pours
a
bright
amber
with
gold
highlights
around
the
edges
smells
of
malts
and
hops
but
not
very
strong
first
taste
is
hops
that
flows
in
then
a
smooth
malt
flows
in
with
really
no
alcohol
taste
present
sily
smooth
mouthfeel
almost
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
heh
dont
wanna
drink
too
many
or
wont
be
feeling
too
well
in
the
morning
but
it
is
hard
not
to
the
abv
while
not
high
is
high
enough
to
lower
the
drinkability
were
it
not
for
that
this
would
make
a
fine
session
brew
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
quite
balanced
i
bet
i
could
drink
this
all
night
although
perhaps
my
wallet
wouldnt
allow
i
know
this
isnt
a
typical
maibock
but
im
definitely
going
to
seek
out
more
now
next
time
im
buying
a
6
pack
instead
of
a
22
ive
never
had
a
red
beer
that
i
liked
before
so
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
not
too
heavy
but
a
good
fillerupper
perfect
for
late
winter
ill
have
to
buy
this
again
drinkability
this
is
quality
stuff
you
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
in
one
sitting
please
go
seek
this
out
i
was
often
curious
as
to
what
this
would
taste
like
exactly
ive
seen
it
sitting
on
the
shelves
at
my
store
for
a
long
time
ive
never
had
to
refill
the
runners
with
it
but
i
enjoyed
the
name
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
it
looked
good
had
a
nice
color
the
head
was
quite
big
which
i
liked
a
lot
i
dont
know
if
i
had
a
skunky
beer
but
it
smelled
terrible
i
was
shocked
at
how
bitter
it
tasted
but
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
been
it
wasnt
very
smooth
and
the
bitterness
remained
in
my
mouth
long
after
i
was
done
with
the
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
nicely
and
is
very
tasty
which
allows
you
to
throw
it
back
easily
the
only
thing
that
diminishes
its
drinkability
is
that
it
may
fill
you
just
a
bit
however
i
could
certainly
kill
a
few
of
these
large
bottles
before
i
get
too
hammered
and
realize
that
im
not
tasting
it
anymore
d
amazingly
drinkable
brew
the
size
mug
i
was
drinking
was
basically
two
pints
plus
2
oz
could
have
drank
some
more
but
alcohol
was
kicking
in
and
i
had
to
commute
home
on
the
subway
great
easy
drinking
extremely
flavorful
wellbalanced
ale
d
i
had
two
and
would
have
continued
if
it
wasnt
getting
late
tastes
good
and
filling
poured
an
orangehued
coppery
color
with
the
thinnest
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fell
to
very
light
lacing
smells
primarily
of
floral
hops
combined
with
a
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
has
a
nice
sweetness
about
it
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
malt
and
slight
hoppy
bitterness
alcohol
flavor
present
as
well
medium
body
with
fine
and
light
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
rougher
than
most
leaves
a
slight
alcoholhop
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
solid
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
over
the
top
about
it
easily
drinkable
have
had
much
better
from
rogues
but
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
poured
a
really
light
clear
dark
honey
color
with
almost
no
head
very
few
carbonation
bubbles
come
up
from
the
bottom
the
smell
is
a
nice
mixture
of
hops
malts
a
faint
fruit
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
its
a
nice
rich
tasting
beer
actually
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
if
you
ask
me
goes
down
very
well
the
flavor
just
like
that
smell
has
something
i
cant
quite
name
hints
of
apricot
hop
profile
is
subtle
and
could
be
stronger
in
my
opinion
meh
its
okay
never
had
an
example
of
the
style
before
but
from
what
i
read
this
seems
to
be
a
fair
example
i
guess
ill
give
it
another
shot
sometime
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
clings
throughout
smells
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
much
stronger
than
the
smell
suggests
fruity
and
malty
at
first
then
you
can
really
taste
some
alcohol
finishes
quite
hoppy
to
perfectly
balance
the
malt
moderate
carbonation
with
a
slick
smooth
mouthfeel
a
well
balanced
beer
ill
take
another
md
big
rich
and
oily
initially
on
the
mouthfeel
yet
softening
all
the
time
towards
a
soothing
texture
in
the
very
end
this
is
my
firstever
maibock
and
i
must
say
im
quite
impressed
yet
its
hard
to
imagine
a
german
lager
is
so
low
in
terms
of
carbonation
and
contains
such
highoctane
aromatic
hoppyness
in
a
sense
it
is
indeed
like
some
american
ipas
ive
tried
and
its
so
very
nice
all
the
same
d
really
pleasant
to
drink
a
couple
i
wouldnt
choose
it
for
beer
pont
though
looking
forward
to
having
deadguy
again
hopefully
on
tap
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
too
special
either
very
mellow
yet
awesome
quite
tasty
a
whole
lot
of
munich
malts
seems
to
get
sweeter
near
the
end
probably
too
fruity
to
fit
the
style
but
rogue
has
never
really
adhered
to
styles
all
that
well
feel
is
good
and
i
bought
a
case
of
this
since
i
know
it
drinks
rather
well
drinkable
enough
but
nothing
special
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
was
a
light
orange
color
almost
honey
color
with
a
nice
head
of
foam
that
left
some
rings
and
lace
around
the
glass
it
had
a
wonderful
aroma
of
juicy
fruits
with
some
sweet
malts
in
the
background
at
first
i
was
expecting
this
to
have
an
average
ale
taste
but
there
is
nothing
average
about
this
taste
up
front
there
was
some
juicy
fruits
then
some
sweet
malts
and
at
the
very
end
some
bitter
hops
it
wasnt
too
hoppy
it
wasnt
low
in
the
hops
it
was
just
right
much
like
the
three
bears
story
but
with
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
with
a
nice
dose
of
carbonation
this
made
for
a
nice
well
balanced
ale
and
a
good
rogue
product
i
wish
i
had
bought
the
22oz
bomber
of
this
beer
kinda
brickbrown
colored
as
it
sits
in
my
glass
not
much
of
a
head
with
nonexistent
lacing
down
the
side
smell
well
hard
to
describe
but
i
can
detect
some
kind
of
fruit
maybe
raspberry
taste
of
fruit
on
the
tongue
as
well
and
hoppier
than
expected
for
the
style
come
to
think
of
it
maybe
a
little
darker
colored
for
the
style
i
would
rate
this
a
slightly
better
than
average
brew
to
drink
have
had
it
with
smoked
brisket
and
thought
it
went
well
this
pours
a
hazy
amber
gave
is
some
good
head
a
fizzy
bubbly
stuff
that
shrinks
to
nothing
after
a
while
with
little
head
to
speak
of
smells
sweet
and
of
mildly
toasted
malts
and
hop
goodness
and
has
a
deep
fruit
aroma
something
orangish
and
tropical
pretty
nice
taste
is
initially
of
grainy
earthy
hops
and
some
good
malty
toasted
something
seems
like
the
alcohol
becomes
apparent
throught
the
middle
and
and
has
a
very
nice
warming
touch
this
is
one
of
those
id
call
very
well
balanced
in
character
with
carbonation
and
smoothness
and
alcohol
warmness
and
hops
and
malts
all
balancing
each
other
out
one
way
or
another
which
makes
this
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
o
props
to
the
guys
at
rogue
wow
a
style
that
is
typically
fermented
as
a
lager
and
they
used
their
pacman
ale
strain
awesome
job
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
cheers
quite
drinkable
while
i
was
not
as
impressed
with
this
brew
as
i
have
been
with
many
other
rogue
brews
it
is
still
quite
well
done
rogue
remains
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
brewers
i
like
this
will
pick
up
more
soon
this
is
another
good
brew
from
the
folks
at
rouge
and
my
first
maibock
look
forward
to
trying
other
examples
of
this
style
and
other
rouge
br
first
of
all
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
the
taste
between
a
growler
and
bottle
this
is
quite
a
bit
more
bitter
it
looks
a
bit
darker
than
i
remember
and
also
seems
to
be
a
bit
cloudy
the
head
was
small
but
reading
my
bottle
reveiw
i
said
the
same
thing
about
it
then
there
seems
to
be
a
little
difference
in
taste
between
serving
types
i
have
had
this
beer
ontap
as
well
and
it
was
far
different
perhaps
i
will
reveiw
it
ontap
sometime
still
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewer
this
is
the
one
beer
to
have
when
you
are
having
only
one
cuz
any
more
then
one
of
these
guys
12
oz
and
you
arent
getting
up
it
is
that
heavy
a
feeling
beer
the
problem
is
that
it
just
doesnt
have
the
rest
to
back
it
up
all
that
weight
in
your
body
and
the
body
of
the
beer
is
just
medium
think
guiness
flavor
is
pretty
one
dimentional
too
nice
bitterness
along
the
lines
of
a
strong
cup
of
coffee
sweetness
and
maltiness
are
sort
of
muted
by
the
odd
alcoholsomething
i
cant
place
aroma
not
bad
just
not
part
of
my
palate
memory
all
in
all
not
what
you
are
hoping
for
and
ye
for
some
reason
i
come
back
to
it
every
so
often
just
to
be
underwhelmed
its
flavorful
its
not
that
great
though
i
think
theres
a
certain
hype
about
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
something
goodexcellent
but
i
got
an
average
strong
beer
i
didnt
go
reaching
for
a
second
bottle
and
neither
did
anybody
else
there
are
better
drinks
to
quaff
there
is
a
light
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
is
overall
quite
nice
it
is
refreshing
overall
it
was
different
than
expected
a
much
simpler
brew
while
i
could
probably
have
another
i
dont
see
the
point
more
exciting
stuff
out
there
while
this
is
a
great
brew
i
have
one
point
of
contention
with
it
call
me
old
fashioned
but
if
you
categorize
a
beer
as
any
type
of
bock
it
better
be
a
lager
however
because
dead
guy
does
have
a
lot
in
common
with
many
of
the
maibocks
ive
tried
and
because
its
a
fairly
exceptional
brew
im
more
than
willing
to
overlook
any
sort
of
classification
gripe
i
might
have
highly
recommended
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
beer
and
i
see
why
they
sell
it
in
giant
growlers
i
prefer
this
beer
relatively
cool
after
it
starts
to
warm
up
the
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
never
astringent
or
ginny
but
it
leaves
a
certain
sickly
taste
as
the
carbonation
starts
to
fade
and
the
beer
warms
6
5
abv
a
lot
or
a
little
depending
on
what
youre
used
to
but
two
of
these
put
me
in
a
right
cheerful
mood
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
it
is
enjoyable
it
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
is
still
tasty
i
could
drink
a
few
or
more
of
these
in
one
sitting
sort
of
reminds
of
an
esb
lots
of
malt
but
a
big
hop
presence
as
well
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
though
true
to
style
by
the
description
full
and
smooth
mouthfeel
plenty
of
sweetness
makes
this
a
bit
filling
but
very
enjoyable
as
well
body
falls
just
below
medium
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
a
nonthinker
and
easy
to
put
away
this
beer
drank
easily
and
was
not
very
filling
i
would
definately
enjoy
another
one
dead
guy
is
a
very
good
beer
what
rogue
beer
isnt
right
a
little
more
expensive
than
id
like
around
8
for
a
six
pack
but
thats
rogue
for
you
this
wasnt
a
knock
my
socks
off
beer
but
its
a
very
solid
brew
and
one
you
should
try
if
you
havent
however
the
beer
pourse
a
cloudy
amber
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
that
could
hold
and
lace
a
little
better
than
it
does
it
smells
rather
sweet
but
not
to
strong
of
a
smell
it
tasted
of
a
good
level
of
hop
bitterness
with
some
mild
fruity
malts
that
give
it
an
initial
sweetness
it
hold
well
in
ones
mouth
with
some
good
carbonation
and
some
slight
dryness
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
that
can
be
drank
easily
the
smell
was
sweet
with
fruits
amd
malt
caramel
and
hops
although
this
was
a
decently
hoppy
beer
it
wasnt
terribly
bitter
it
was
sweeter
with
a
complex
taste
of
fruits
rather
spicy
and
a
nice
finish
it
was
clean
and
quite
spicy
but
rather
drinkable
this
isnt
rated
too
high
but
i
think
its
pretty
damn
good
poured
this
beer
into
my
pilsner
glass
it
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
it
smelled
of
caramel
and
hops
taste
of
caramel
and
fruit
not
too
hoppy
of
a
beer
medium
spicy
and
roasted
malt
flavor
good
carbonation
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
just
like
all
the
rogues
12
ounce
bottle
dead
guy
ale
pours
out
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
huge
long
lasting
head
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
plums
apricots
and
hops
biscuity
malt
flavor
up
front
which
then
becomes
toasted
fruity
flavors
come
in
at
the
middle
sweetness
turns
bitter
in
the
finish
this
beer
isnt
as
hoppy
as
your
average
rogue
beer
but
it
has
some
tasty
bitterness
a
little
spicy
with
an
alcohol
kick
in
the
finish
too
this
is
the
first
beer
i
ever
bought
and
its
still
a
favorite
golden
amber
fluffy
head
with
sticky
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
honeyed
malts
and
candied
fruits
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
orange
zest
taste
is
primarily
golden
roasty
malts
with
enough
citrusleafy
hop
sparkle
to
balance
the
gesture
toward
sweetness
toasted
biscuits
medium
body
lightly
chewy
mouthfeel
ive
been
craving
maltiness
lately
and
this
didnt
quite
live
up
to
what
i
remembered
as
a
surprisingly
tasty
maltforward
beer
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
its
definitely
a
great
beer
to
have
in
my
hand
while
hanging
lights
on
the
xmess
tree
cheers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
a
strikingly
gorgeous
deep
amber
with
strong
ruby
tones
the
color
was
nice
enough
that
it
was
even
complimented
by
a
nonbeer
drinker
whom
i
was
playing
pool
with
at
the
time
unfortunately
there
has
about
the
least
head
formation
i
have
ever
seen
with
just
a
bit
of
a
sudsy
ring
around
the
beers
surface
and
that
is
all
smell
is
straightforward
with
a
balanced
earthy
scent
some
strawberry
notes
but
nothing
overpowering
taste
is
quite
delicious
earthy
and
smooth
especially
after
warming
up
a
but
really
invites
large
swigs
this
is
a
very
high
quality
ale
which
could
easily
be
chosen
to
introduce
friends
to
craft
beer
because
of
its
approachable
flavor
yet
all
the
signs
of
a
high
quality
product
are
here
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
spicy
bold
hops
and
malt
and
sweet
honey
notes
in
the
background
it
doesnt
have
the
sulfur
qualities
of
a
lager
but
it
does
have
a
crisp
clean
quality
that
is
nice
very
pleased
even
though
not
a
growler
in
the
true
fresh
sense
bottle
didnt
seem
to
apply
since
this
was
not
the
12
oz
or
22
oz
bomber
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
could
sit
around
and
drink
these
all
night
long
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
poor
retention
and
very
weak
lacing
toasted
amber
malt
and
floral
hop
nose
crystal
malt
nut
honey
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
pronounced
english
hop
presence
and
hint
of
fruit
ester
tiny
rushing
bubbles
carbonate
the
light
body
and
give
it
a
crisp
mouthfeel
aftertaste
is
clean
but
the
finish
is
semiresidual
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
complex
malt
profile
is
well
balanced
with
pronounced
hops
but
its
still
nothing
to
shout
about
the
taste
is
a
spicy
blend
of
malt
and
hops
with
some
touches
of
alcohol
in
the
backend
this
is
a
unique
tasting
and
satisfying
beer
tasty
enough
but
ill
leave
this
one
for
you
guys
overall
i
would
recommend
it
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
acquire
relatively
speaking
a
great
example
of
american
craft
beer
uf
d
very
drinkable
brew
nice
session
beer
my
neighbor
dropped
this
off
in
exchange
for
a
stones
ipa
the
dead
guy
poured
a
hazy
orangecopper
i
thought
it
would
be
clearer
there
was
a
white
head
that
remained
for
most
of
the
glass
very
malty
bready
smell
then
i
got
some
caramel
and
the
smell
ended
with
some
piney
hops
the
malts
hit
first
with
a
semisweet
caramel
then
a
hint
of
the
hops
the
hops
and
malts
seem
to
be
in
real
good
balance
not
too
much
of
one
or
the
other
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
almost
chewy
but
there
was
a
real
clean
finish
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
mouthfeel
is
thin
sticky
and
syrupy
average
carbonation
which
is
visible
until
the
end
its
very
very
drinkable
as
the
body
is
so
light
and
the
taste
so
mild
a
little
close
to
a
pale
ale
in
flavor
for
my
tastes
but
the
bottle
surprised
me
by
emptying
itself
very
quickly
yes
it
went
down
well
and
so
did
the
second
one
thereafter
thick
creamy
foam
ice
bergs
on
a
brilliant
amber
sea
the
head
gradually
disappeared
but
it
was
quite
a
sight
the
odor
was
complex
with
obvious
malt
and
toast
honeyfloral
undertones
the
rich
malt
dominated
the
flavor
alcohol
was
noticeable
and
the
bitter
finish
was
assertive
but
not
aggressive
nice
body
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
a
thick
head
with
moderate
retention
maltybready
nose
with
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
with
brown
sugar
and
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
and
bitterness
there
is
nothing
to
get
exited
about
in
here
but
this
is
a
solid
quaffable
brew
drinkability
is
very
high
this
goes
down
so
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
something
different
than
the
typical
hop
bomb
ales
that
are
very
popular
these
days
so
far
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
rogue
sofa
king
expensive
smooth
as
silk
probably
not
for
everyone
but
for
those
who
like
a
lot
of
taste
and
a
somewhat
heavier
ale
well
worth
a
try
if
you
like
it
youll
want
several
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
but
this
is
not
one
id
seek
out
a
very
good
beer
but
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
my
first
dead
guy
ale
although
i
have
another
bottle
in
storage
which
ill
try
again
in
a
couple
of
weeks
not
quite
as
fantastic
as
i
was
expecting
given
its
reputation
and
given
how
much
i
adore
rogue
chocolate
stout
but
still
quite
good
and
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
if
i
happen
to
see
it
being
from
canada
im
always
concerned
about
the
freshness
of
us
micros
exported
to
canada
where
is
free
trade
as
they
are
always
held
in
bond
at
customs
federal
before
they
are
distributed
to
government
provincial
run
liquor
outlets
all
bureaucracy
aside
this
ale
stood
the
test
of
time
and
i
was
duly
rewarded
poured
to
a
carmel
brown
with
a
healthy
lacing
with
slow
retention
wafts
of
nugmeg
and
other
spices
added
to
the
experience
had
a
dry
feeling
in
your
mouth
much
like
drinking
cold
tea
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
left
me
craving
another
freshness
was
not
an
issue
another
excellent
rogue
product
well
worth
the
potential
bureaucratic
quagmire
drinkablility
good
got
this
in
a
650ml
bottle
interesting
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
malt
hazy
reddishcopper
hue
with
a
nice
quarter
inch
of
white
head
and
lacing
smells
of
fruit
grass
maybe
hints
of
hops
the
taste
is
quite
appetizing
somewhat
spicy
a
little
sweet
and
fruity
caramel
malts
maybe
and
the
bitterness
kicks
in
towards
the
end
complete
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
fine
aftertaste
as
many
have
mentioned
it
hides
its
alcoholic
character
quite
well
so
its
pretty
drinkable
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
well
this
is
my
first
rogue
and
first
maibock
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
nice
carbonation
and
alot
of
lacing
scents
of
hops
citrus
spices
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
and
unique
taste
of
sweetbitter
malt
theres
a
medium
body
the
lacing
just
does
not
want
to
disappear
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
at
6
5
highly
recommended
i
will
revisit
this
one
in
the
very
near
future
again
the
first
time
i
ever
sampled
this
brew
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
but
it
has
grown
on
me
since
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
on
tap
definitely
recommended
damn
fine
brew
another
winner
from
rogue
mouthfeel
of
most
rogue
beers
to
me
seem
so
rich
and
creamy
but
not
overbearing
above
average
in
this
style
and
one
ive
gone
back
to
again
and
again
you
can
never
go
back
to
the
well
too
many
times
with
this
caveat
emptor
i
havent
had
a
maibock
except
for
this
one
which
ive
tried
a
few
times
this
has
a
rather
nice
smell
i
cant
quite
tell
the
individual
components
of
it
but
it
seems
to
be
dominated
by
a
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
bit
of
hops
it
tastes
good
it
starts
of
fairly
sweet
and
then
finishes
with
a
taste
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
its
pleasant
though
the
carbonation
is
decent
but
nothing
amazing
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
too
but
the
aftertaste
can
get
a
bit
strong
after
a
while
so
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
more
than
two
at
a
time
overall
drinkability
solid
i
find
this
to
be
a
nearperfect
dinner
beer
those
new
to
the
beer
might
want
to
give
it
a
few
tries
as
the
overall
quality
of
the
beer
can
sneak
up
on
you
when
youre
not
looking
drinkability
couldnt
even
find
word
one
about
this
beer
dont
even
know
if
its
a
pale
ale
or
not
i
just
know
it
was
pretty
damn
good
different
and
quenching
a
nicely
balanced
refreshing
beerbracing
enough
for
50
degree
nights
i
have
no
idea
why
its
dead
guy
ale
ok
but
not
all
that
great
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
ill
take
it
if
offered
not
for
the
feint
of
heart
or
the
novice
beer
drinker
excellent
this
is
highly
drinkable
but
also
high
abv
caution
its
hard
to
find
a
really
good
maibock
dead
guy
ale
is
exceptional
very
full
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malts
and
lots
of
both
this
beer
doesnt
mess
around
this
is
the
best
maibock
ive
tasted
since
wurzbergers
maibock
and
i
dont
even
know
if
that
is
produced
anymore
the
only
drawback
to
the
beer
is
its
11
a
six
pack
steep
price
for
an
american
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
balanced
the
first
thing
noticable
about
the
taste
is
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
but
the
hops
balance
very
nicely
noticable
alchohol
taste
with
a
great
meduim
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
which
is
even
better
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
very
good
and
filling
beer
good
flavor
impressive
appearance
and
very
well
balanced
overall
too
bad
it
costs
too
damn
much
to
make
it
a
regular
a
great
looking
two
finger
head
with
a
dark
coppery
look
when
i
picture
an
ale
in
my
mind
i
picture
this
color
too
many
ales
are
to
light
in
my
opinion
a
full
spiced
ale
but
not
an
overwhelming
tastejust
right
this
is
a
great
ale
from
on
of
the
best
brewers
in
america
slightly
hazy
maplecaramel
colour
toped
by
a
short
dense
cream
head
that
showed
a
bit
of
lacing
grainy
caramel
maltiness
in
the
aroma
with
fruity
undercurrants
hops
are
restrained
but
there
is
a
bit
of
grassiness
bitterness
hits
you
right
away
while
the
rest
of
the
flavours
seem
to
complement
this
character
as
they
appear
and
fade
away
toasted
malt
shows
up
next
followed
by
a
bit
of
plum
and
light
spicy
herbal
hops
caramel
and
pleasant
alcohol
appear
at
the
end
and
carry
through
the
finish
at
which
point
the
bitterness
finally
starts
to
fade
soft
carbonation
is
well
integrated
with
the
texture
which
starts
to
dry
out
in
the
middle
but
this
fades
in
the
finish
fully
bodied
without
being
sticky
lingering
alcohol
warmth
at
the
finish
as
well
all
around
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
coming
back
overall
a
wellmade
beer
but
it
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
wow
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
and
this
exceeded
my
expectations
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
kick
ass
session
beer
maybe
a
little
high
abv
though
drinkability
because
of
its
mild
taste
and
subtle
character
it
is
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
a
unique
brew
which
bridges
the
style
gap
between
maibock
and
ale
if
anyone
asked
for
this
perhaps
i
feel
let
down
aster
all
the
hype
touting
this
as
a
grman
style
and
im
a
mad
german
bock
and
lager
hound
frankly
id
rather
drink
mellow
lagered
german
maibock
but
if
there
is
none
available
this
ale
will
fill
the
bill
its
a
wonderful
beer
its
just
not
a
maibock
scents
of
caramel
toffee
toast
and
some
floral
hops
man
this
tastes
really
good
honey
rolling
over
my
tongue
medium
bitterness
rather
full
bodied
and
medium
carb
im
going
to
score
this
a
bit
lower
and
the
overall
because
its
not
a
maibock
if
its
made
with
ale
yeast
its
probably
a
bit
too
dark
also
but
damn
it
is
good
this
poured
orangecopper
with
very
little
head
but
i
think
that
is
only
because
i
poured
it
too
softly
the
aromas
were
of
slight
hops
up
front
buit
were
quickly
covered
by
the
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
was
of
citrusy
caramel
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
grape
nuts
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
made
for
a
dry
finish
and
the
low
carbination
made
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
of
this
is
that
it
should
be
enjoyed
by
everybody
very
smooth
finish
a
great
session
beer
also
a
good
beer
to
recommend
to
someone
just
getting
into
mircos
not
a
great
session
beer
but
still
good
its
not
very
filling
certain
subtle
tastes
in
it
would
make
hesitant
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
they
are
good
tastes
but
i
think
i
would
get
sick
of
them
after
a
few
of
these
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
worth
a
try
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
im
surprised
ive
never
reviewed
it
drank
once
or
twice
per
month
at
the
local
pizza
pub
pours
a
nice
deep
coper
to
auburn
color
translucent
vibrantly
carbonated
and
impressively
headed
and
laced
smells
of
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
spices
and
esters
tastes
about
as
sweet
and
dark
as
possible
without
getting
into
heavy
roasted
grains
lots
of
barley
molassas
and
brown
sugar
mild
smooth
flavors
of
prunes
dates
raisons
and
almonds
more
highly
hopped
than
most
would
expect
picking
up
fuity
esters
and
spicy
alcohol
full
rich
body
that
remains
creamy
under
the
abundant
carbonation
finishes
sweet
and
a
bit
malty
ive
always
considered
this
a
dopplebock
no
matter
where
you
categorize
it
its
a
good
beer
pours
a
brownish
honey
color
with
a
large
bubbled
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
weak
but
nonoffensive
fairly
basic
with
rich
malt
smells
but
just
not
much
of
them
the
taste
is
slightly
complex
sweet
malts
in
front
followed
by
a
strange
fruit
flavor
and
finnished
with
slightly
bitter
hops
im
not
sure
about
the
fruit
it
seems
almost
peachy
but
maybe
darker
mabye
there
is
a
real
small
amout
of
extract
in
it
carbonation
is
decent
and
the
feel
is
not
exactly
heavy
or
oily
but
not
light
either
this
is
a
real
middle
or
the
road
brew
overall
its
a
real
drinkable
beer
but
sorta
hard
to
describe
it
is
my
first
maibock
review
but
this
beer
is
just
sorta
hard
to
pin
down
i
would
buy
it
again
i
suppose
one
of
the
best
brews
to
grab
on
tap
as
far
as
im
concerned
pours
a
dark
honey
color
with
a
fat
finger
of
creamy
head
that
dissipates
in
several
seconds
leaving
a
very
light
lacing
pretty
color
smell
is
pretty
strong
containing
hefty
malts
detecting
a
lot
of
caramel
and
coffee
along
with
solid
hops
and
some
alcohol
taste
follows
suit
with
a
strong
but
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
a
lot
of
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
mixed
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
too
eh
i
expected
more
smoothness
from
the
mouthfeel
although
some
is
present
overall
id
drink
it
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
its
features
overall
this
was
an
average
offering
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
anything
that
is
this
sweet
so
i
probably
am
not
the
best
judge
but
needless
to
say
i
will
not
return
an
instant
classic
rogue
really
has
a
winner
and
an
all
around
great
ale
along
with
anchor
steam
this
is
one
of
my
tried
and
true
stand
bys
ive
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
and
neither
fails
to
please
a
good
full
hearty
ale
which
is
well
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
little
to
say
about
this
beer
which
is
bad
sometimes
beers
are
brewed
which
are
just
damn
near
perfect
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
have
been
to
the
rogue
brewery
a
couple
of
times
although
its
been
several
years
and
have
always
enjoyed
sampling
their
offerings
i
will
say
im
confident
id
have
ranked
this
higher
had
it
been
poured
from
a
tap
good
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
nice
off
white
head
nice
malty
nose
with
a
light
nuttiness
and
caramel
undertone
taste
is
very
nice
with
a
soft
rich
maltiness
a
good
substitute
for
an
oktoberfest
when
they
go
out
of
season
and
you
need
a
fix
mouthfeel
is
good
and
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
maybe
a
bit
for
an
everyday
fix
but
if
you
have
a
malty
marzenmaibock
jones
this
is
an
able
substitute
an
interesting
orangeamber
color
with
slight
haze
and
an
average
amount
of
offwhite
head
nose
was
pleasant
but
understatedsweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
those
qualities
carry
over
to
the
taste
which
is
nicely
malted
up
front
fading
to
a
bit
of
bitterness
that
lingers
just
about
right
a
smooth
but
not
chewy
mouthfeel
helps
make
this
an
unexceptional
but
nicely
drinkable
beer
also
congrats
to
rogue
ales
brewery
on
their
gold
medals
okay
the
head
has
dissipated
enough
that
i
have
struck
beer
caramelly
toasty
malt
prevails
medium
hop
bitterness
comes
through
quickly
leaving
a
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
super
creamy
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
admittedly
i
know
little
about
the
maibock
style
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
ale
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
have
to
wonder
about
the
excessive
foaming
though
pours
a
dark
bronze
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
left
nice
lacing
through
out
the
whole
glass
smell
is
of
caramel
and
very
sweet
mouthfeel
is
thick
overall
this
is
unlike
any
other
maibockhelles
bock
ive
ever
had
a
beer
that
is
classified
as
a
helles
clear
bock
shoudl
at
least
be
clear
not
dark
and
cloudy
like
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
also
too
thick
for
it
to
be
a
good
maibock
however
even
if
this
brew
wasnt
intended
to
be
a
maibock
by
the
brewer
i
still
didnt
like
it
reviewing
this
sprecher
mai
bock
capital
brewery
mai
bock
and
tyranena
fighting
finches
mai
bock
simultaneously
this
is
the
least
attractive
of
the
three
a
cloudy
dull
redamber
color
with
almost
no
lacing
smells
floral
and
faintly
sweet
initial
taste
is
of
sweet
apples
and
bitter
hops
with
the
bitterness
lingering
the
taste
is
too
unbalanced
i
think
in
favor
of
the
hops
its
fairly
unpleasant
to
drink
feels
a
little
harsh
in
the
mouth
as
well
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
drinkable
deep
reddish
mahogany
or
dark
amber
honey
colored
with
enough
haze
to
render
it
opaque
creamy
offwhite

that
left
chunky
bits
of
lacing

to
the
inside
of
the
glass
all
the
way
to

bottom

floral
scent
with

wafting
though
and
a
faint
tingle
on
the
nose

content

caramel
and

flavors
in
the
initial
sweet
malt
impression
toasty
bitterness
creeps
in
soon
after
adding
bite
to
the
malt
before
crushing
it
with
a
heavy
hops
burst
midpalate
strong
finish
that
is
noticably
more
hops
than
malt
despite
the
touted
balanced
finish
and
has
great
lingering
power
felt
smooth
at
first
then
more
mediumbodied
and
a
bit
chewier
or
oily
appropriate
carbonation
very
decent
brew
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
less
pale
with
plenty
of
hops
i
got
another
rogue
to
try
tommorow
i
hope
it
is
as
good
as
this
was
dn
i
think
i
like
this
beer
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
tap
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
flavours
are
not
as
distinct
as
they
were
at
the
start
however
this
actually
makes
the
beer
smoother
and
as
a
result
more
drinkable
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
result
of
the
beer
my
palate
adjusting
to
the
grapefruit
hops
or
the
temperature
i
started
at
compared
to
the
temp
at
the
end
either
way
the
beer
is
smoother
at
the
end
but
the
flavours
are
not
as
dramatic
or
bold
basically
youre
getting
one
good
thing
at
the
expense
of
another
regardless
this
is
a
very
good
offering
from
rogue
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
tend
more
towards
ales
than
lager
but
this
is
fantastic
it
has
more
character
than
the
last
marzen
i
enjoyed
but
not
quite
so
much
as
some
of
the
better
ipas
at
6
50
for
a
6pack
this
beer
will
find
a
welcome
home
in
my
fridge
any
day
of
the
week
drinkability
could
make
for
a
fantastic
session
brewgoes
down
deceptively
smoothly
very
malty
very
malty
the
nose
was
somewhat
mellonlike
or
some
fruit
i
cant
remember
when
i
was
in
puerto
rico
passion
fruit
the
appearance
either
escapes
me
or
was
completely
unremarkable
i
might
revise
that
in
the
near
future
as
i
have
another
bottle
the
taste
was
a
great
thick
malty
flavor
with
some
burnt
toast
and
an
excellent
creamy
consistency
you
got
the
impression
you
were
drinking
fresh
baked
sweet
bread
in
a
sense
i
had
to
clean
my
pallete
afterward
but
almost
regretted
doing
so
as
the
feel
and
taste
werent
anything
to
complain
about
12
fl
oz
bottle
trade
with
maeib
pours
very
foamy
and
fizzy
with
a
decent
lingering
head
deep
amber
colour
hazy
sweet
yeasty
aroma
with
elements
of
oak
molasses
butter
and
hayloft
flavour
has
some
molasses
sweetness
butter
butterscotch
some
spices
and
decent
hops
but
lacks
a
fresh
and
spritzy
bite
too
much
butter
elements
i
guess
still
a
beer
well
above
average
but
im
not
ecstatic
this
is
a
nice
beer
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
a
double
bock
which
is
nice
im
not
a
terrible
fan
of
malty
sweet
beers
i
think
years
ago
i
made
some
chili
using
this
with
good
results
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
i
won
this
beer
at
a
club
meeting
so
it
was
worth
the
price
of
raffle
tickets
i
probably
wont
buy
it
an
okay
beer
but
one
that
i
will
soon
forget
hopefully
theyll
get
the
quality
control
controlled
at
the
bar
so
i
can
get
a
real
taste
of
this
fresh
and
alive
instead
of
buttery
and
gross
until
then
i
may
as
well
live
in
ohio
doh
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
a
little
too
syrupy
for
me
to
pound
down
many
at
a
time
but
this
is
an
amazing
beer
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
there
is
a
significant
alcohol
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
smell
is
a
bit
closer
to
solvent
than
id
prefer
in
a
beer
the
taste
is
less
dominated
by
alcohol
though
its
presence
is
more
noticable
than
i
would
expect
for
6
5
this
beer
definately
gets
most
of
its
flavor
from
malt
with
hops
playing
a
secondary
role
its
fairly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
something
burnt
it
has
a
light
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
but
i
think
id
get
bored
after
two
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
id
expect
a
sixpack
to
cost
8
not
11
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
brown
some
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
table
of
beige
nose
is
malty
with
a
strong
candied
fruit
aroma
taste
is
malts
and
some
hops
good
but
not
expceptional
the
candied
fruit
is
less
pronounced
but
still
present
throughout
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
such
a
malty
and
sweet
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
expensive
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
company
poured
an
amber
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
and
no
lacing
smell
was
light
and
malty
not
much
going
on
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
upfront
with
hints
of
caramel
and
plums
and
nicely
balanced
with
a
solid
woodsy
hops
presence
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
syrupy
smooth
feel
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
stone
offeringsits
not
bad
but
its
just
not
good
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
very
disappointing
i
pour
this
beer
fro
ma
12
oz
bottle
into
a
wide
mouth
stem
med
glass
nice
rich
color
medium
head
retention
with
a
sweet
pleasant
aroma
taste
oh
yeah
baby
this
is
some
good
stuff
full
boidied
great
balance
and
depth
at
6
5
abv
i
must
be
careful
i
could
drink
this
maibock
all
friggin
night
rogue
never
ever
dissapoints
me
i
love
this
stuff
ive
always
tried
this
beer
straight
out
of
the
bottle
so
this
is
my
first
time
pouring
it
into
a
glass
and
am
i
surprised
to
find
that
this
beer
is
a
reddishorange
amber
not
sure
why
but
i
thought
it
would
look
even
darker
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
along
with
the
hop
aroma
there
is
a
fruit
punch
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
but
the
alcohol
is
also
prevalent
and
the
hops
give
it
a
perfumymetallic
taste
mouthfeel
has
a
dry
finish
i
didnt
like
this
beer
in
college
but
it
is
growing
on
me
loads
of
good
malty
sweet
flavours
caramel
honey
toasted
some
sublte
dark
fruity
tones
wander
around
decent
hopping
woody
spicy
a
little
bit
herbal
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
overall
pretty
solid
tasty
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
fruity
esters
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
a
nicely
done
maibock
smell
the
taste
is
a
bready
and
slightly
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
floral
hop
taste
that
ends
in
a
citrusy
tart
bitterness
overall
a
quality
brew
maybe
nothing
outstanding
but
very
drinkable
and
complex
enough
to
satisfy
the
experienced
craft
brew
drinker
a
great
session
beer
oh
well
still
a
great
brew
from
the
hazy
orange
pour
with
ivory
head
to
the
lightly
spiced
malty
aroma
and
taste
hops
are
lite
ibu
40
perfectly
carbed
lite
in
the
mouth
and
drinkable
for
the
short
or
long
haul

the
6
5
is
craftily
hidden
i
really
like
this
beer
the
name
is
creative
and
the
bottle
as
well
pours
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
that
doesnt
retain
very
well
the
smell
is
not
very
powerful
and
nothing
really
stood
out
except
the
famous
and
exclusive
i
think
pacman
yeast
but
it
was
still
had
a
very
pleasing
maltiness
tone
i
really
like
the
taste
of
the
pacman
so
i
am
partial
to
most
of
the
rogue
offerings
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
feels
like
silk
on
the
tongue
and
the
back
of
the
throat
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
price
is
pretty
high
here
in
the
south
10
for
a
six
pack
so
i
try
to
savor
every
ounce
of
this
well
crafted
brew
paid
4
99
for
a
650ml
bottle
i
think
that
what
could
have
made
this
beer
better
would
have
been
more
malt
balancing
to
offset
the
hop
bitterness
i
am
open
to
the
idea
that
others
would
prefer
the
assertive
hop
character
though
this
one
was
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
like
this
much
better
ontap
than
in
bottles
satisfying
either
way
but
ontap
is
the
way
to
go
if
you
have
the
choice
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dry
but
it
is
quite
good
i
give
a
4
5
for
drinkability
a
very
hearty
beer
has
just
enough
bitterness
to
be
interesting
while
leaving
a
very
clean
finish
well
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
pretty
soft
leaving
you
with
a
dry
finish
at
first
taste
my
mouth
was
filled
with
beer
euphoria
something
you
get
when
you
havent
tasted
a
really
good
beer
in
a
really
long
time
good
beer
i
will
definitely
have
to
get
it
again
in
the
near
future
a
good
beer
from
rogue
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
it
seems
like
everything
in
this
beer
is
in
balance
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
rogue
picked
a
good
beer
to
be
their
flagship
brew
pours
a
somewhat
orange
tinged
amber
color
no
real
head
though
a
good
carbonation
level
malty
aromatouch
of
caramel
sweetness
medium
hop
bitterness
good
malt
flavor
somewhat
dry
in
the
finish
ok
body
for
style
an
average
beer
overall
i
know
its
popular
with
some
folk
but
rogue
can
and
does
do
better
overall
impression
a
very
enjoyable
offering
from
rogue
and
a
great
gateway
beer
to
get
your
friends
to
drink
better
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
standbys
and
a
regular
purchase
if
im
attending
a
party
in
conclusion
rogue
dead
guy
recommended
nice
medium
light
mouthfeel
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
after
making
my
notes
i
read
other
reviews
and
it
looks
like
we
are
reviewing
3
or
4
different
beers
perception
or
reality
draft
light
amber
brew
with
off
white
head
malt
aroma
with
some
cardboard
faint
spice
from
the
hops
i
thought
the
taste
was
very
good
it
has
a
smooth
malt
taste
with
some
caramel
the
hops
are
subdued
but
offer
some
spiciness
and
floral
notes
a
easy
drinking
low
hop
pale
ale
served
on
tap
in
a
standard
pint
glass
i
cant
believe
ive
never
reviewed
this
beer
given
the
number
of
times
ive
had
it
pours
a
deep
dark
orange
with
about
12
inch
of
lasting
head
smell
is
subdued
but
is
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
taste
is
creamy
smooth
fruity
i
think
id
maybe
put
this
more
into
an
alt
category
but
thats
me
it
tastes
almost
as
if
it
was
served
on
cask
except
on
draught
immensely
drinkable
though
the
fruitiness
could
get
old
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
orange
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
head
and
almost
no
retention
or
lacing
the
aroma
had
a
light
sweetness
to
it
it
reminded
me
of
raisens
a
lot
mangos
too
even
in
the
mouth
it
feels
very
chewy
and
full
again
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
tastes
almost
like
honey
the
hops
arent
in
the
forefront
of
this
only
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
tastes
a
lot
like
a
less
complex
less
grassyearthy
belgian
its
a
very
full
beer
so
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
but
id
certainly
drink
another
this
is
a
beer
i
can
and
have
drinkdrunk
all
night
long
comments
interesting
that
they
would
make
a

this
a

brew
some

in

smooth
and
highly
drinkable
better
then
average
sessioner
the
drinkablility
of
the
dead
guy
is
alright
there
is
nothing
in
this
brew
that
is
offensive
or
overpowering
moreover
there
is
nothing
in
this
beer
that
compels
me
to
hustle
back
to
the
refrigerator
to
get
another
glass
this
brew
is
pleasant
but
unremarkable
the
psychedelia
on
the
bottle
is
groovy
though
poured
nice
and
rich
red
very
thin
head
that
quickly
went
away
smelled
good
with
no
smell
of
alcohol
tasted
of
hops
and
fruit
not
too
overly
carbonated
which
is
a
good
thing
to
me
sweeter
aftertaste
maybe
could
be
a
little
stronger
on
flavor
something
that
can
be
a
session
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
much
of
this
at
a
time
but
i
could
see
having
a
hankering
for
this
brew
id
say
give
it
a
go
but
wouldnt
expect
everyone
to
like
it
mildly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
is
of
fruit
it
has
apples
pears
and
a
mild
citrus
character
the
malt
lends
a
sweetness
to
the
aroma
caramel
to
accent
the
apples
these
characteristics
show
up
in
the
flavor
too
the
apple
comes
through
and
the
caramel
character
of
the
malt
in
the
flavor
a
mild
toffee
character
comes
through
too
the
hops
lend
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
the
beer
the
yeast
brings
a
certain
character
too
many
people
do
not
care
for
the
flavor
lent
by
the
pac
man
yeast
but
i
thin
it
comes
across
well
in
this
beer
it
has
a
mildly
slick
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
so
does
the
wife
as
easy
as
this
is
to
drink
this
could
get
expensive
this
ale
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
head
that
is
quickly
forgotten
there
is
a
distinct
aroma
of
flowery
hops
and
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
toffeelike
sweetness
taste
is
of
raisins
and
cashew
nuts
with
the
flowery
hops
on
top
and
the
toffeecaramel
sweetness
underneath
not
much
depth
of
flavor
but
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
diacetyloily
with
smooth
finish
and
inadequate
carbonation
that
is
quickly
history
pretty
drinkable
but
not
the
best
offering
that
rogue
has
out
drinkability
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
but
it
was
pleasant
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
id
appreciate
this
beer
more
if
i
had
2
or
3
i
also
remember
this

being
much
better

old

i
will
raise
a
dead
guy
in
your
honor
a
very
nice
fullbodied
brew
flavorful
like
an
ipa
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
amber
like
color
smells
of
malts
with
some
hops
and
fruits
tastes
of
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
as
well
as
dry
fruits
has
a
very
pronounced
malty
taste
with
lingering
hops
takes
a
few
sips
to
really
get
a
feel
for
this
one
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
had
this
in
a
22oz
bottle
a
year
ago
and
it
was
my
first
rogue
i
have
had
many
since
then
i
would
definately
recomend
this
beer
a
nice
beer
but
the
taste
of
alcohol
spoiled
some
of
the
experience
nice
brew
obviously
no
killer
the
first
sign
that
this
ones
not
your
standard
beer
comes
when
you
pour
it
its
almost
orangealmost
redalmost
brown
i
guess
well
go
with
ruby
but
it
looks
really
interesting
in
my
tulip
small
head
that
leaves
little
lace
and
doesnt
retain
particularly
well
malty
smell
with
hops
fruit
and
a
little
spice
in
it
do
i
detect
nutmeg
i
wont
swear
to
that
one
though
the
taste
is
also
interesting
my
first
few
sips
were
a
big
upfront
sweetness
that
wasnt
cloying
but
close
that
settled
into
a
nice
hoppy
finish
that
lingered
as
a
hoppy
aftertaste
as
it
warmed
for
a
few
minutes
out
of
the
fridge
though
the
sweetness
became
less
overwhelming
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
tasty
beer
but
its
just
a
tad
out
of
balance
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
enjoyed
immensely
and
will
not
hesitate
to
try
again
worth
the
hype
if
just
a
tiny
bit
too
malty
sweet
for
me
a
very
unique
brew
unlike
what
many
may
expect
poured
out
to
a
red
amber
golden
color
that
was
almost
similar
to
fruit
punch
odor
was
consistant
with
overtones
of
fruits
nuts
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
suprisingly
smooth
texture
with
flavors
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
crisp
presentation
of
flavors
was
enjoyable
as
was
the
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
disappeared
quickly
recommended
a
very
good
brew
in
all
aspects
but
it
can
be
a
bit
pricey
id
say
its
worth
it
but
not
everyday
overall
a
great
ale
to
sit
about
and
shoot
the
sht
with
notes
its
not
one
of
the
big
boldflavored
beers
from
rogue
but
still
a
decent
session
beer
the
appearance
is
a
very
cloudy
and
hazy
golden
with
a
very
thin
white
lacing
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
absolutely
dominated
by
a
sweet
malty
presence
there
is
enough
hop
balance
to
where
i
can
stand
to
drink
it
but
overall
i
am
not
too
fond
of
this
beer
anymore
perhaps
if
the
malts
were
slightly
roasted
or
if
the
hops
bitterness
and
aromas
were
more
balanced
this
would
make
a
hell
of
a
brew
but
now
that
ive
walked
the
path
of
the
hopside
this
isnt
nearly
as
quenching
as
it
used
to
be
leaves
a
somewhat
dry
finish
a
good
beer
to
convert
macro
drinkers
though
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
dead
guy
has
a
cloudy
redorange
color
to
it
i
love
the
color
but
there
wasnt
as
much
head
as
expected
i
didnt
give
it
a
very
hard
pour
though
the
beer
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruit
to
it
very
nice
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
theres
plenty
of
sweet
tasting
malt
in
the
brew
and
theres
a
nice
touch
of
citruslike
hops
behind
it
that
becomes
more
prominent
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
very
flavorful
beer
dead
guy
is
the
first
rogue
beer
that
ive
tried
and
i
think
ill
be
giving
more
of
their
beers
a
taste
excellent
stuff
all
and
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
i
will
definitely
drink
again
pours
a
nice
burnt
orange
or
copper
color
a
nice
head
with
some
white
lacing
but
it
is
short
lived
taste
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
its
a
nice
light
caramel
apple
like
taste
some
smoky
malt
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
its
a
bit
heavy
so
drinkability
is
questionable
joey
this
is
quite
a
killer
beer
give
me
more
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
slight
hazy
topped
by
a
creamy
white
head
it
looks
remarkably
like
unused
motor
oil
the
smell
is
very
sweet
caramel
and
some
fruit
along
with
piney
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
and
malty
smooth
with
hints
of
caramel
hops
are
pungent
and
piney
nice
balance
for
the
big
malt
bill
finish
is
sweet
caramel
and
alcohol
pleasant
easy
drinking
brew
looks
like
used
motor
oil
and
smells
sweet
and
fruity
the
first
taste
is
hoppy
bitterness
followed
quickly
by
malty
ester
a
little
too
sweet
initial
hop
impression
is
gone
leaving
a
sweet
alcoholic
aftertaste
thin
to
medium
bodied
good
session
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
light
tan
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
head
fades
pretty
quickly
leaving
un
even
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
deeply
of
sweet
malts
with
some
dark
fruit
notes
and
a
whiff
of
booze
taste
is
everything
that
was
in
the
nose
all
at
once
a
cacophany
of
flavors
that
fits
the
bill
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
a
classic
that
is
always
an
enjoyable
one
to
revisit
poured
a
dark
hazy
golden
body
with
a
good
head
good
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
fruit
kind
of
toasty
spicy
fruity
and
lots
of
malt
sweetness
could
use
some
more
hops
to
balance
medium
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
and
quite
a
session
brew
blah
rogue
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
too
sweet
too
malty
and
way
way
unbalanced
i
feel
like
they
just
forgot
to
add
any
kind
of
tasty
hops
normally
i
love
rogue
brews
but
this
is
one
is
just
nt
my
cup
of
tea
the
sweetness
really
overpowers
the
other
flavors
and
winds
up
destrying
what
couldve
been
a
wonderful
brew
oh
well
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
lasted
a
good
while
good
lacing
aroma
was
faint
but
a
malty
smell
did
come
out
as
well
as
some
hop
presence
some
raisin
and
caramel
notes
as
well
a
nice
malty
flavor
hits
immediately
followed
by
adequate
hop
bitterness
hop
flavor
quickly
dissapears
and
leaves
just
enough
bitterness
some
raisin
caramel
vanilla
flavors
also
detected
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
has
decent
drinkability
not
one
for
a
warm
summers
day
but
enjoyable
this
time
of
year
a
good
solid
brew
this
is
a
hop
lovers
dream
as
i
like
my
balance
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
maltyi
will
not
seek
this
one
out
before
summer
and
the
need
to
beat
the
three
hs
of
nj
weather
hazy
hot
and
humid
a
perfect
beer
after
a
hard
days
work
cheers
what
a
delightful
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
yet
extremely
flavorful
a
nice
copper
amber
beer
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
presents
hops
orange
and
cinammon
while
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
balance
between
hops
and
malt
this
beer
was
served
on
tap
and
the
yardhouse
in
pasadena
the
beer
came
with
a
nice
2
cm
tan
head
on
top
and
a
clear
red
color
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
excellent
with
a
sweet
caramel
and
light
summer
fruit
smell
to
it
fresh
apple
and
pear
scents
along
with
a
refreshing
clean
malt
scent
the
flavor
starts
with
a
tangy
burst
of
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
floral
hoppy
flavor
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
bitterness
it
ends
with
those
same
fruity
flavors
as
in
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
but
very
light
cherry
flavors
this
beer
had
no
sour
characteristics
to
it
despite
the
many
fruit
flavors
a
crisp
and
clean
malt
profile
makes
this
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
over
and
over
again
and
i
did
poured
this
beer
into
a
duvel
goblet
color
reminiscent
of
orange
hawaian
punch
the
pac
man
yeast
is
doing
its
job
and
carbonation
was
perfect
mostly
malt
in
the
nose
with
hints
of
honeysuckle
in
terms
of
taste
flavors
of
malt
rainer
cherries
and
plums
i
love
its
crisp
taste
and
the
beer
seems
like
some
kind
of
barleywinered
ale
combo
the
6
percent
is
well
hidden
well
done
and
ill
be
drinking
this
again
soon

a
6
pack
of
these
in
a
night
i
like
rogue
for
brewing
this
unique
style
of
beer
and
distributing
it
so
widely
this
will
definatly
expand
beer
drinkers
horizons
hope
to
find
more
varities
of
this
style
in
the
future
nice
glow
in
the
dark

not
my
favorite
beer
or
style
but
would
buy
again
another
fine
beer
from
rogue
cloudy
dark
copper
under
a
fairly
shortlived
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
leaves
no
lace
strong
sweet
malt
nose
with
a
hint
of
flowery
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
good
smooth
taste
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
dominating
until
the
hops
come
out
in
the
finish
flowery
in
nature
the
hops
are
never
over
the
top
just
leaving
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
not
quite
espresso
but
a
bit
more
than
capucchino
the
sweet
malt
never
goes
away
completely
making
this
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
too
malty
to
be
an
ipa
not
sweet
enough
to
be
an
amber
not
sure
what
id
call
this
i
guess
maibock
is
as
good
as
any
name
thanks
to
mrpicklerelish

like

i
had
another
here
right
now
great
choice
that
is

often
found
at

in

let
alone

specialty

paid

for

12
oz

nice

great
snesation
in

mouth
appeared
like
an

very
drinkable
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
in
a
draft
as
well
if
available
catchy
name
and
label
flaky
film
of
head
to
start
with
just
a
smidgen
of
lace
as
the
glass
became
less
full
copper
slightly
weak
metallic
brown
hue
but
still
fathomable
treacly
malt
bouquet
that
seems
to
be
a
plaintive
calling
aspect
overall
garrulous
malt
freneticism
to
taste
with
aged
pablum

toasted

seeds
and
light
brown
sugar
sweetness
though
hidden
experienced
an
upper
mouth
slam
with
a
back

coolness
while
partaking
cacophanous

affords
this
brew
a
simple
but
direct
statement
of
dont
mess
with
the
dead
guy
or
youll
be
dancing
with
bears
for
all
those
who
are
not
with
us
today
drinkability
it
has
its
own
flavor
thats
for
sure
i
dont
like
the
overall
taste
enough
to
have
another
but
thats
only
because
im
faced
with
50
other
taps
i
see
on
the
website
that
this
beer
is
in
the
graveyard
and
was
brewed
for
the
aquarium
series
a
few
years
ago
i
guess
its
been
resurrected
in
small
quantities
for
the
rogue
publik
houses
such
as
kclingers
in
etters
pa
this
beer
taste
to
good
not
be
drinkable
but
is
probably
too
rich
and
too
strong
to
drink
to
many
at
once
disturbingly
easy
to
handle
and
consume
highly
pallateable
and
enjoyable
this
would
make
a
nice
appetizer
to
any
meal
and
would
go
well
with
a
light
salad
reflection
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
and
it
never
lets
me
down
for
christmas
i
wrap
different
styles
of
beer
for
my
coworkers
to
try
and
this
one
has
made
the
cut
for
the
last
five
years
doesnt
rank
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
had
this
on
tap
today
at
the
ale
house
this
ale
doesnt
change
a
whole
lot
from
bottle
to
tap
in
my
opinion
maybe
because
rogue
doesnt
pasturize
or
anything
like
that
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
i
suppose
it
could
be
hopped
up
more
to
provide
more
balance
there
certainly
is
enough
delicious
fruity
malt
to
handle
it
a
great
fallback
excellent
drinkability
try
it
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
sweet
and
a
little
creamy
it
reminds
me
of
a
raspberry
cream
saver
candy
the
flavir
is
not
right
there
is
sweet
caramel
in
there
but
a
really
offensive
bitter
flavor
that
i
dont
like
the
feel
is
moderately
thick
nd
a
bit
creamy
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
taste
i
really
didnt
like
it
all
that
much
a
very
deceptive
6
5
abv
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
this
could
make
a
great
session
brew
for
an
evening
with
friends
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
hangs
throughout
the
glass
fruitty
smell
with
a
hint
of
melon
tastes
of
citrusy
hops
fruitty
esters
with
a
grainy
and
malty
finish
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
it
is
a
refreshing
brew
pretty
drinkable
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
is
good
here
extremely
easy
to
gulp
and
not
too
bubbly
drinkability
is
great
here
as
well
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
a
good
session
option
imho
the
dead
guy
is
worth
a
try
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
i
have
been
working
my
way
through
the
rogue
brewery
beers
i
am
pleasently
suprised
by
the
smooth
yet
complex
taste
a
nice
touch
of
bitter
and
a
deep
flavour
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
the
aroma
is
also
as
deep
as
the
taste
i
recommend
this
one
as
almost
a
dark
wheat
taste
funny
how
ive
had
this
beer
so
many
many
times
and
am
yet
to
review
it
it
might
be
getting
close
to
the
lead
for
most
reviews
i
make
number
441
pours
from
the
22oz
bottle
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
hue
with
a
small
head
that
subsides
quickly
pleasant
aroma
of
floral
bitter
hops
plum
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
sturdy
slightly
foamy
body
holds
a
wellbalanced
palate
of
lightly
roasted
malt
lightly
bitter
hops
and
an
underlying
taste
of
fruit
plums
grapes
a
tad
bitter
on
the
finish
while
not
my
favorite
beer
its
a
good
consistent
presence
in
my
fridge
dead
guy
is
also
a
wonderful
fallback
in
many
places
where
the
selection
may
otherwise
be
big

macro
swill
nice
malty
yet
easy
to
drink
beer
beware
of
the
alcohol
it
is
very
smooth
for
a
beer
of
6
5
abv
its
a
perfect
choice
for
halloween
poured
from
a
standard
330
ml
bottle
lots
of
almost
white
foam
that
has
lasted
until
the
end
of
the
glass
a
cloudy
medium
reddish
brown
colour
with
some
orange
hues
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
with
some
citrusy
notes
the
taste
is
also
malty
but
a
little
too
light
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
finish
and
very
clean
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
fullbodied
and
smooth
this
beer
is
quite
good
tasty
and
with
a
high
drinkability
factor
although
its
6
5
abv
it
does
not
taste
like
so
and
would
therefor
be
an
excellent
session
beer
picked
up
a
6
pack
in
illinois
that
works
out
to
be
about
10
cdn
so
overall
an
excellent
deal
for
such
quality
beer
very
recommended
dark
cloudy

with
almost
nothing
in

of

moments

is
low

away
softly
until
the
taste
is
ransacked
by
the

not
my
favorite
rogue
beer
as
far
as
taste
goes
but
great
complexity
and
drinkability
nothing
amazing
about
the
appearance
standard
brownishamber
color
bit
of
head
on
there
what
can
i
say
it
looks
like
a
beer
but
it
smells
great
this
is
a
straightup
ale
sometimes
i
find
a
lot
of
ales
that
are
pretty
hoppy
more
like
a
pale
ale
but
this
one
is
true
to
style
more
like
a
bock
or
something
a
mild
sweet
aroma
that
sweetness
definately
comes
out
in
the
taste
quite
malty
and
spring
tasting
i
can
picture
a
bunch
of
skeletons
brewing
this
stuff
up
in
oregon
feels
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
thick
in
the
mouth
i
could
drink
this
shit
till
im
dead
sorry
that
was
lame
lets
just
say
that
this
is
a
solid
well
balanced
and
outstanding
beer
good
bye
i
had
never
had
this
brand
before
and
was
lucky
enough
for
a
fellow
ba
to
bring
this
over
to
my
place
this
beer
poured
an
autumn
brown
with
a
good
head
its
aroma
definitely
was
enticing
with
a
floral
hops
character
its
taste
was
extremely
smooth
which
some
might
say
as
a
macro
beer
slogan
but
definitely
isnt
a
bad
thing
it
was
just
the
right
sweetness
with
just
the
right
bitter
of
hops
it
felt
great
in
the
mouth
not
too
thick
not
too
thing
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
more
than
one
but
its
a
little
higher
in
alcohol
so
how
much
more
is
another
question
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
slightly
turbid
bronzy
copper
color
with
a
nice
light
beige
head
malty
rich
and
fruitlike
and
candylike
hop
aromas
in
the
aroma
malt
sweetness
hits
the
palate
like
a
ton
of
bricks
mixed
with
some
plumskin
like
fruitiness
and
the
hops
work
well
to
counterbalance
the
sweet
malt
the
hops
are
pungent
but
the
malt
is
moreso
this
has
always
been
a
very
nice
beer
an
interesting
hybrid
between
the
maltiness
of
a
bock
and
the
hoppiness
of
many
west
coast
beers
this
being
one
of
them
works
out
well
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
lace
it
smells
of
sweet
fruity
malt
this
is
certainly
not
an
overhopped
ale
like
many
of
the
popular
west
coast
ales
as
the
taste
is
more
dominated
by
the
malty
sweetness
i
taste
a
very
slight
tropical
fruit
taste
too
which
is
quite
intriguing
the
carbonation
cleans
the
palate
quite
nicely
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
many
of
them
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
a
drinkable
brew
good
flavor
wonderful
color
and
an
inviting
nose
what
more
could
you
want
very
tasty
brew
here
one
i
could
happily
sip
all
day
or
night
actually
long
wow
im
really
glad
i
got
around
to
trying
this
beer
dead
guy
ale
pours
a
dark
and
slightly
hazy
amber
color
the
head
is
light
brown
and
lightly
creamy
head
height
is
average
smell
is
nice
and
malty
it
has
that
sweet
bready
aroma
taste
is
excellent
flavor
is
initially
malty
sweet
then
the
nice
slightly
bitter
hops
kick
in
and
really
balance
this
brew
out
finish
is
a
tasty
sweet
blend
of
hops
and
malts
it
seems
like
every
sip
i
notice
something
new
about
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
right
on
and
drinkability
only
suffers
from
the
filling
nature
of
dead
guy
ale
for
me
this
beer
is
a
must
try
maybe
this
is
how
a
maibock
is
supposed
to
taste
your
mileage
may
vary
the
smell
was
lightly
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
when
tasting
the
malt
comes
through
with
a
light
hop
taste
lightly
sweet
the
body
is
medium
to
light
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
could
have
several
in
one
sitting
pours
a
deep
coppery
orange
color
with
a
firm
white
head
about
an
inch
thick
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
aromas
consist
of
sweet
caramel
some
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
zesty
hop
initial
flavors
consist
of
a
bit
of
citrus
flavoring
followed
by
a
wide
arrange
of
malts
which
leave
a
multitude
of
flavors
ranging
from
toffee
to
biscuit
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
doughy
bread
like
flavor
there
is
also
a
nice
estery
yeast
flavor
in
the
mix
which
really
adds
some
complex
flavors
to
the
brew
the
finish
is
quite
citrusy
and
zesty
from
a
nice
strong
hop
finish
overall
this
brew
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
refreshingly
crisp
carbonation
that
is
almost
biting
on
the
tongue
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
one
but
what
a
surprise
copper
color
sturdy
head
malty
and
dried
fruit
in
the
bouquet
strong
hop
in
the
mouth
well
balanced
by
malt
and
fruit
complexity
mouthfeel
was
a
treat
very
effervescent
and
foamy
higher
carbonation
than
expected
i
could
drink
many
this
beer
has
a
clean
amber
color
with
a
small
beige
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
in
the
background
the
taste
has
a
serious
sharp
hop
bitterness
with
again
a
hint
of
grapefruit
sweetness
somewhere
in
the
middle
has
a
crisp
finish
dead
guy
ale
pours
a
copper
color
w
a
small
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
with
stong
malt
in
front
laced
the
glass
nicely
taste
was
unimpresive
think
that
the
bottle
is
bad
extemely
bitter
acrid
taste
kind
of
like
soda
water
with
bitters
added
surrely
a
bad
bottle
with
no
way
to
tell
age
it
is
hard
to
tell
how
old
this
crap
is
huge
dissapointment
will
re
review
when
a
fresh
sample
can
be
obtained
love
the
name
of
this
beer
was
always
curious
what
it
tasted
like
great
aroma
lots
of
citrus
fruits
that
are
balanced
nicely
by
the
malts
nice
balanced
fruity
taste
as
well
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
highly
enjoyable
a
must
try
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
smoothness
in
the
mouthfeel
very
high
drinkability
and
a
recommended
brew
for
those
who
dont
normally
go
for
the
hoppy
stuff
but
still
want
something
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
full
bodied
goes
down
like
butter
high
alcohol
though
and
since
its
so
smooth
its
easy
to
drink
too
many
of
these
dead
guy
is
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
the
pint
i
was
served
had
almost
no
head
limited
carbonation
and
no
lace
whatsoever
it
was
a
flat
bronze
color
clear
but
without
luster
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
an
adequate
mouthfeel
but
was
nowhere
up
to
rogues
customary
high
standards
it
tastes
well
balanced
and
clean
with
a
rounded
malt
profile
and
a
punctual
finish
but
as
the
name
might
suggest
the
dead
guy
lacks
vitality
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
heavy
the
light
carbonation
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
drinkability
ok
for
me
seemed
very
filling
and
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
certainly
a
well
made
brew
but
i
probably
wont
be
back
for
more
the
taste
is
bold
and
oaky
but
very
smooth
not
overpowering
it
sits
well
on
the
tongue
and
new
flavors
emerge
as
you
easily
hold
it
for
more
of
a
taste
one
quick
bite
as
it
goes
down
and
the
glass
comes
up
for
another
drink
overall
a
solid
great
tasting
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
dense
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
sour
apples
cherries
and
caramel
malt
yum
taste
is
plenty
malty
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
spicy
hops
as
well
candyesque
tastes
show
through
in
different
capacities
as
you
drink
it
and
it
warms
whether
its
the
reported
cotton
candy
or
caramel
apples
finishes
mildly
bitter
on
the
tongue
its
medium
to
full
and
ever
so
smooth
a
blanket
of
gentle
carbonatin
soothes
the
tongue
a
great
highly
drinkable
classic
american
micro
that
should
be
tried
at
least
once
by
all
theres
always
room
for
some
in
my
fridge
wyll
like
most
of
rogues
stuff
this
fails
to
impress
me
i
think
i
am
narrowing
it
down
to
their
odd
bittering
hoppage
and
the
boring
yeast
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
i
am
likely
to
return
to
cloudy
light
amber
with
a
small
head
smells
bready
with
clean
hops
taste
is
malty
with
some
hop
presence
and
a
very
nice
solid
bitter
finish
good
mouthfeel
a
little
hop
oily
very
good
drinkability
good
both
as
a
session
and
with
food
very
nice
classic
beer
overall
but
this
may
be
an
old
bottle
that
said
its
outstanding
with
a
meal
id
put
it
with
thick
soups
pasta
deli
sandwiches
etc
and
great
as
a
nightcap
at
the
end
of
a
session
overall
this
is
one
good
beer
its
so
easy
to
drink
that
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
rusty
orangebrown
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
dead
guy
doesnt
have
a
very
strong
smell
just
a
bit
malty
the
beer
itself
is
quite
tasty
though
a
sweet
mix
of
malt
caramel
and
orange
peel
with
a
silky
texture
and
a
nice
fruitygrainy
finish
ive
always
liked
this
beer
they
still
print
these
occasionally
with
an
orange
version
of
the
deadguy
label
that
glows
in
the
dark
dont
know
if
that
was
an
annual
halloween
stunt
or
what
but
its
cool
tried
this
one
on
a
suggestion
from
an
ipa
lover
it
had
a
orange
honey
color
kind
of
cloudy
held
a
decent
head
throughout
the
glass
smell
was
somewhat
fruity
taste
was
sweeter
than
expected
made
me
think
of
crisp
sweetness
not
too
hoppy
but
just
enough
is
that
possible
from
someone
who
usually
drinks
dark
stouts
maybe
my
tastes
are
changing
maybe
its
just
summer
and
hot
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
will
definetly
drink
it
again
had
this
awhile
back
and
forgot
to
review
it
its
definitely
a
good
classic
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
yet
not
particulary
my
favorite
style
but
still
a
fine
beer
and
one
i
would
order
again
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
i
find
it
very
satisfying
i
had
it
served
in
a
bottle
and
the
bartender
walked
away
before
i
could
get
a
glass
it
is
quite
hoppy
but
not
overhwelmingly
so
almost
bittersweet
the
carbonation
is
mild
and
actually
what
i
think
makes
this
beer
so
good
the
aroma
has
hints
of
banana
the
taste
also
has
hints
of
fruit
but
ive
never
been
able
to
decide
exactly
what
im
a
big
fan
of
this
very
drinkable
very
moreish
so
drinka
ble
finishes
like
it
started
bitter
but
interesting
not
immensely
drinkable
to
my
tastes
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
fails
to
get
the
maibock
style
completely
right
imo
ill
give
it
a
go
again
sometime
but
im
not
sold
on
it
as
a
mainstay
of
my
regimen
this
is
one
complex
ale
the
sugar
in
the
nose
is
apparent
like
a
sarsparilla
candy
cane
but
there
is
also
a
smoky
yet
suppleness
to
this
one
the
hops
are
present
but
muted
to
my
liking
this
is
excellent
stuff
i
dont
get
enough
rogue
in
my
diet
and
need
to
drink
more
note
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
on
tap
and
absolutely
love
it
though
i
am
not
very
impressed
by
the
bottle
offering
had
this
on
tap
at
dr
dremos
dead
guy
came
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
not
much
head
to
it
probably
due
to
the
bartender
more
than
the
beer
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
hoppy
citrus
smell
with
creamy
malt
and
fruity
smell
to
go
along
taste
starts
off
with
a
bitter
hoppiness
with
spiciness
to
it
a
nice
creamy
malt
flavor
on
the
back
to
provide
some
balance
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
has
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
and
it
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
the
name
is
intriguing
even
though
im
not
much
of
a
bock
afficianado
nontheless
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
the
dead
guy
ale
pours
a
honeycaramel
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
thatim
not
kiddinghas
a
green
tint
to
it
the
hops
come
first
to
the
nose
but
underneath
are
some
pines
and
light
grape
and
citrus
tints
the
taste
is
excellent
very
complex
but
balanced
it
starts
off
with
a
nutty
sharpness
mostly
hops
but
a
little
sweet
too
and
theres
some
good
strong
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
heavily
carbonated
dark
amber
brown
with
a
small
bit
of
quickly
receding
head
smell
is
very
nice
with
some
buttery
pine
nut
flavors
overlapping
malts
and
hops
on
the
back
taste
is
much
the
same
with
similar
components
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sharp
with
good
amounts
of
carbonation
feels
perfect
on
the
back
of
the
pallate
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
hidden
within
it
to
make
it
quite
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
summer
evening
poured
out
golden
with
a
decent
head
that
was
nice
and
creamy
sugary
scent
malts
vanilla
great
bite
with
pepper
and
hops
alcohol
very
nice
one
this
is
one
beer
that
i
have
always
ordered
when
seeing
it
on
a
beer
menu
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
knowing
that
it
has
remained
consistant
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
copper
color
with
a
yellowed
offwhite
head
that
starts
off
at
a
couple
fingers
but
quickly
fades
to
a
lasting
14
inch
layer
of
foam
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
citrusy
hop
aroma
taste
includes
sweet
bready
malt
a
little
fruityness
and
nice
citrus
rindpiney
hop
flavors
very
well
balanced
lingering
hop
bitterness
but
its
not
at
all
harsh
very
smooth
and
drinkable
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
carbonation
is
apparent
but
not
overdone
upon
finishing
the
first
one
i
immediately
wanted
another
not
exactly
to
style
but
who
cares
highly
recommended
and
sure
to
become
one
of
my
regulars
i
hate
to
say
this
but
i
waited
way
too
long
to
try
this
beer
being
an
oregon
native
and
all
perhaps
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
to
share
with
the
fizzyyellow
beer
crowd
in
hopes
of
converting
them
to
the
true
beer
way
hops
give
way
to
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
in
the
mouth
buried
in
a
smooth
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
the
sweetness
takes
over
quickly
pretty
much
obliterating
any
hop
bitterness
malt
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
with
hints
of
chocolate
smoke
and
hay
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
if
i
try
to
drink
more
than
three
of
these
in
a
night
i
wake
up
with
a
headache
which
reduces
the
drinkability
score
somewhat
certainly
not
without
its
charm
but
not
a
whole
not
here
to
distinguish
it
from
other
microbrews
an
intriguing
beer
that
is
not
quite
an
ale
and
not
quite
a
lager
or
both
there
is
a
smoky
element
perhaps
from
the
yeast
that
this
beer
has
in
common
with
anchor
steam
a
similarly
inbetween
beer
also
like
anchor
steam
ive
found
this
beer
can
be
wonderful
if
fresh
and
wellkept
and
blah
if
not
this
is
a
good
fresh
sample
i
like
the
day
of
the
dead
theme
but
the
grateful
dead
association
is
a
little
much
a
disconcerting
and
intriguing
murky
copper
with
good
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
much
its
pretty
invisible
the
beer
itself
is
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
malts
honey
bread
light
smoke
gently
tangy
citric
hops
its
almost
like
a
munichstyle
helles
crosspollenated
with
a
hoppy
pacific
northwest
pale
ale
fine
stuff
notes
nice
beer
to
drink
good
combination
of
flavors
but
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
complexity
not
much
seemed
to
jump
out
flavor
wise
my
first
maibock
the
taste
is
another
story
it
is
a
very
flavorful
bock
with
mostly
roasted
maltiness
and
some
real
underlying
hops
kick
it
is
bubbly
in
the
mouth
but
still
manages
to
be
creamy
i
really
enjoyed
this
first
foray
with
the
dead
guy
once
the
head
settles
it
looks
more
a
glass
of
tea
the
body
thins
as
it
warms
up
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
evident
a
fine
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
a
very
good
beer
i
will
have
to
request
more
of
it
be
ordered
as
i
had
the
last
six
pack
in
the
store
a
fine
ale
pours
an
intermediate
amber
color
a
nice
white
head
forms
but
does
not
last
there
is
however
nice
lacing
throughout
the
duration
tastes
absolutely
wonderul
a
some
what
sweet
malty
caramel
nicely
balanced
with
a
hint
of
bitter
this
is
something
worth
searching
out
a
highly
drinkable
beer
enjoy
theres
almost
a
hint
of
green
apple
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
like
it
im
not
sure
how
it
got
in
there
but
it
seems
to
fit
nicely
the
flavor
is
good
and
blends
the
alcoholic
content
very
well
resulting
in
an
easily
drinkable
beer
amber
in
colour
with
a
hint
of
gold
hops
on
the
nose
mixed
with
a
slight
fruityness
hoppy
flavor
with
a
good
malt
backing
leaves
bitter
crisp
and
easy
drinking
i
can
and
will
drink
this
all
day
long
this
is
a
soso
rogue
beer
is
good
dead
or
alive
happy
beering
wellrounded
awesomely
balanced
brew
on
tap
in
nyc
at
the
blind
tiger
ale
house
copperyreddish
body
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
tea
like
i
specifically
smelled
grapes
taste
is
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
of
things
good
pale
malt
backbone
strong
hop
bitterness
throughout
a
full
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
close
to
ipa
territory
i
will
definitely
be
making
a
return
trip
for
more
of
these
in
fact
i
wish
i
wouldve
picked
up
a
sixer
instead
of
a
bomber
theres
always
next
time
in
fact
now
i
know
why
they
keep
cases
of
this
one
by
the
door
great
session
brew
but
perhaps
not
with
taco
salad
live
and
learn
this
is
the
beer
that
really
got
me
searching
more
than
ever
for
better
beers
had
it
at
a
deep
dish
pizza
place
that
had
the
first
beer
list
i
ever
saw
i
admit
i
was
drawn
by
the
name
but
came
back
for
the
taste
while
it
almost
made
my
girlfriend
sick
she
dislikes
beer
in
general
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
good
one
well
ive
found
that
this
is
also
a
great
beer
prelude
to
bluegrass
as
well
as
classical
i
truly
truly
enjoy
this
beer
i
also
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
pints
from
a
fresh
keg
this
is
one
quaffable
drinkable
beer
additional
comments
really
smooth
nutty
mouthfeel
i
love
the
sweet
hoppiness
and
the
dark
distinct
medium
to
full
body
this
is
almost
a
combination
stoutipa
or
porter
ipa
but
way
better
than
any
black
tan
that
ive
ever
had
truly
wonderful
beer
and
a
favorite
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
maibock
style
pours
a
solid
orange
quite
an
unusual
and
interesting
color
for
a
beer
with
average
head
smells
like
a
pilsner
hoppy
and
crisp
an
excellent
taste
pacman
hops
provide
an
unique
and
subtle
bitterness
semisweet
with
a
hint
of
jasmine
perhaps
a
fun
and
refreshing
brew
already
tons
of
reviews
for
this
beer
so
ill
spare
the
unabridged
review
just
wanted
to
note
the
very
subtle
flavor
of
cotton
candy
i
noticed
in
this
beer
anybody
else
pick
that
up
and
call
me
crazy
but
i
see
this
as
being
a
near
perfect
session
beer
very
very
drinkable
yet
it
has
the
complexities
to
keep
one
interested
for
some
time
give
me
this
stuff
and
just
watch
it
disappear
i
give
dead
guy
the
nod
i
look
foward
to
trying
more
maibocks
in
the
future
this
beer
kinda
reminded
me
of
hopdevil
ale
sans
spiciness
the
negatives
for
this
beer
would
be
that
it
could
have
been
more
bold
and
the
the
aftertaste
can
be
rough
to
the
point
were
it
interferes
with
the
taste
of
your
next
sip
gulp
whatever
i
have
to
say
though
this
beers
positives
far
outweigh
the
negatives
good
beer
for
a
cool
fall
or
spring
night
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
that
didnt
let
me
down
given
how
ledgendary
it
is
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
finally
picked
up
this
legendary
beer
my
expectations
were
kind
of
high
and
i
guess
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
with
it
pours
a
nice
redbrown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
was
tinged
with
beige
smell
is
faint
but
it
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
malt
is
more
easily
perceived
than
the
hops
and
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
like
xingu
this
beer
feels
a
little
bit
thin
to
me
but
i
suppose
the
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
just
a
good
beer
not
great
not
bad
but
good
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
unique
taste
and
good
mouthfeel
dark
orangecopper
color
medium
white
head
smells
of
malt
but
more
dominated
by
hops
big
malt
big
hops
very
satisfying
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
flavorfull
at
the
same
time
pine
and
citrus
are
also
in
the
flavor
i
thought
it
was
a
pale
ale
but
it
apparently
a
pale
bock
according
to
this
site
very
delicious
allaround
ill
admit
to
avoiding
this
rogue
ale
out
of
superstition
after
having
one
at
last
it
seems
an
ideal
spring
ale
this
would
be
a
near
perfect
esb
if
it
were
brewed
with
english
hops
cloudy
amber
with
a
rich
white
head
fairly
good
retention
for
the
alcohol
content
moderate
malty
aroma
lightbodied
slight
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
more
assertive
for
the
style
pale
malt
flavors
hops
just
enough
to
balance
subtle
fruity
tones
sweet
going
down
and
is
that
hops
i
feel
barely
noticable
clean
finish
with
an
interesting
profile
on
the
way
down
quite
likeable
and
distinctive
enough
to
make
this
stand
out
good
example
of
the
style
tastes
pretty
good
with
sweet
caramel
buttery
notes
and
good
hop
bitterness
may
be
better
with
some
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
a
little
but
i
guess
thats
why
they
made
the
brutal
bitter
overall
its
a
good
beer
across
the
board
and
drinkable
enough
to
have
a
few
may
also
be
a
little
better
if
chilled
a
little
more
had
it
a
year
later
on
tap
found
it
sour
but
decent
had
it
again
on
tap
in
may
2005
at
eulogys
and
it
was
above
average
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
and
i
am
sure
i
will
enjoy
it
with
the
pizza
i
am
about
to
eat
taste
is
quite
fruity
and
malty
yeasty
and
sweet
pale
malt
lots
of
floral
hops
up
front
with
an
understated
but
strident
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
pretty
good
but
i
thought
i
would
like
this
more
it
is
a
dark
gold
color
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
hoppy
the
body
is
malty
but
not
too
thick
with
some
fruitiness
orange
and
mango
it
has
a
crisp
hoppy
finish
the
added
fruitiness
from
the
top
fermenting
yeast
is
nice
but
it
comes
across
as
a
very
drinkable
maibock
very
drinkable
brew
tasty
and
full
of
flavor
without
any
defects
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
white
haed
that
falls
to
a
thin
ring
of
foam
sweet
dark
fruity
aroma
intense
malt
flavor
with
strange
fruity
presence
ends
in
a
nice
hop
flavor
and
bite
never
had
a
ale
with
quite
this
taste
before
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
definitely
something
worth
trying
after
thinking
this
you
taste
it
and
realize
you
are
correct
what
is
interesting
about
this
beer
is
that
its
flavor
opens
up
rather
slowly
a
slow
released
change
that
includes
complexities
of
bitter
sweet
and
alcohol
hazy
dark
amber
light
and
airy
sizable
head
substantial
amount
of
bubbles
racing
towards
the
top
some
lace
manages
to
coat
the
glass
aleish
fruitiness
with
a
light
leafy
hoppiness
on
the
nose
sturdy
medium
body
chewy
and
pleasant
pleasantly
sweet
fruity
malt
flavors
mingle
harmoniously
with
a
crisp
hop
oiliness
characteristic
rogue
flavor
underneath
finishes
slightly
dry
eminently
quaffable
this
may
be
my
top
session
ale
of
all
time
unbeatable
in
its
sheer
quaffing
pleasure
i
need
to
drink
more
of
this
now

a
bomber
features
an
outstanding
mouthfeel
full
buttery
and
smooth
but
not
heavy
in
the
least
quite
drinkable
and
something
i
am
glad
to
have
experienced
honey
color
slight

a
really
beautiful
beer
definite
sweet
aroma
crisp
hops
also
slight
citrus
too
sits
very
smooth
in
mouth
not
too
heavy
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
slight
sweet
taste
like
honey
followed
by
a
crisp
slightly
bitter

element
very
nice
brew
could
definitely
drink
a
few
will
definitely
buy
again
purchased
this
in
the
1
pint
6
fluid
ounce
650ml
size
bottle
poured
a
medium
reddish
brown
now
let
me
say
this
i
tried
the
chocolate
stout
from
rogue
about
6
months
ago
and
it
was
just
really
not
for
me
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
to
be
tactful
and
polite
but
many
people
have
been
saying
that
i
absolutely
had
to
try
the
dead
guy
and
boy
were
they
right
wow
the
taste
is
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tasted
before
its
a
little
bitter
at
first
and
i
mean
a
little
bitter
it
goes
down
smooth
and
then
a
few
seconds
after
you
swallow
it
leaves
a
faint
taste
of
caramel
almost
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
make
this
one
real
easy
to
drink
but
if
you
pay
attention
to
it
and
are
looking
for
it
when
you
first
take
a
sip
its
a
tiny
tiny
bit
thick
which
makes
it
something
you
wouldnt
want
to
kill
a
whole
lot
of
in
a
sitting
nevertheless
ill
be
buying
this
stuff
again
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
creamy
drinkability
is
very
good
while
not
an
every
day
choice
for
me
this
is
a
beer
i
always
enjoy
was
one
of
the
favorites
with
my
old
coworkers
and
i
can
see
why
rogue
dead
guy
ale
is
a
supreme
beer
the
apperance
is
exceptional
gold
honey
in
color
the
usual
amber
color
the
head
was
a
gorgeous
cream
color
that
lasted
the
whole
way
through
the
smell
is
of
malts
with
caramel
and
a
fruity
scent
the
taste
is
good
very
good
the
hops
are
very
present
in
this
beer
not
to
much
though
sweet
caramel
malt
aftertaste
fells
full
and
colorful
in
the
mouth
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
you
want
a
good
ale
dont
look
any
farther
that
dead
guy
ale
mouthfeel
there
is
decent
carbonation
in
this
beer
it
makes
it
very
drinkable
a
very
mild
beer
that
i
would
have
again
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
rogue
dead
guy
ale
was
rich
copper
in
color
and
topped
by
a
small
offwhite
head
that
left
excellent
lacing
the
nose
presented
a
rich
but
delicate
roasty
malt
aroma
and
a
light
resiny
hop
profile
the
taste
resembled
a
subdued
barleywine
with
a
firm
rich
roasty
malt
body
light
and
zippy
citrus
notes
and
a
big
bitter
finish
with
lingering
roastyness
all
of
this
was
well
balanced
and
held
up
by
an
appropriately
full
body
dead
guy
is
a
full
flavored
session
beer
good
for
the
roastybitter
fan
taste
crisp
in
the
mouth
but
doesent
attack
perfectly
hoppy
for
me
the
hops
lets
you
know
its
there
right
at
the
begining
and
then
exits
the
stage
very
gracefully
a
little
sweet
right
after
the
hops
i
would
guard
this
one
till
the
death
just
are
our
character
does
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
just
not
as
bold
as
i
would
like
it
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
for
someone
with
less
bold
tastebuds
but
after
two
pints
i
would
probably
want
to
switch
up
on
draught
at
the
mojoe
lounge
at
easton
pours
a
clear
reddishamber
color
with
a
thin
skeletonbone
head
thin
and
quick
lacing
the
aroma
is
mildly
citrusy
hops
along
with
a
touch
of
spice
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
flavorable
blend
of
floral
hops
citrus
honey
and
spice
the
flavor
is
kind
of
like
arrogant
bastards
mini
me
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
making
this
for
an
allaround
gooddrinking
beer
this
is
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
orange
hues
and
a
little
head
that
lingers
there
is
a
smell
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
there
is
an
almost
candy
like
taste
to
this
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
quality
product
that
i
will
never
get
tired
of
aftertaste
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malts
that
leaves
a
great
feeling
on
your
tastebuds
rogue
puts
out
good
stuff
and
this
is
no
exception
possibly
one
of
their
best
dead
guy
ale
may
be
the
most
ubiquitous
craft
brew
in
this
city
every
store
that
carries
beer
seems
to
carry
it
its
obvious
that
its
a
quality
offering
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
exceptional
even
though
ill
probably
drink
it
again
it
wont
be
anytime
soon
a
great
session
beer
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
a
full
but
not
heavy
mouthfeel
fits
extremely
well
with
the
malt
upfront
and
hop
flavorbitterness
finish
the
taste
lingers
a
long
time
with
more
of
the
sweetness
than
the
bitterness
in
the
linger
easy
drinking
and
quite
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
while
i
prefer
a
less
hoppy
beer
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
change
the
taste
was
there
but
was
enjoyable
without
a
strong
aftertaste
ahh
dead
guy
at
a
tasting
seminar
once
i
had
asked
the
woman
at
the
rogue
table
for
one
of
these
she
promptly
told
me
that
this
beer
was
so
yesterday
well
i
must
disagree
this
was
one
of
my
first
introductions
to
the
world
of
better
beer
and
still
holds
its
own
today
this
version
poured
a
bit
hazy
in
appearance
the
color
is
an
orangeyamber
and
the
head
was
thin
the
aroma
is
full
with
sweet
fruity
malts
and
has
a
touch
of
spiciness
the
taste
is
of
light
malts
and
leans
towards
the
sweet
fruit
side
rather
than
the
bitter
there
are
some
citrus
and
lemony
hops
in
there
but
are
well
disguised
by
the
sweet
malt
alcohol
is
hidden
well
under
a
blanket
of
flavors
very
lively
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
for
sure
a
malt
lovers
beer
but
it
has
a
very
good
ammount
of
bitterness
to
interest
the
hop
heads
as
well
it
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
left
nice
spider
webs
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
fruity
and
malty
and
i
couldnt
wait
to
taste
the
flavor
was
great
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
fit
the
malty
flavor
perfectly
but
just
when
you
think
its
all
malt
the
hops
came
in
and
added
a
great
element
to
the
flavor
even
my
coors
drinking
dad
loved
this
one
so
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
a
good
one
to
start
novices
on
deep
orangecopper
with
a
lively
tan
head
which
dissipated
but
leaving
foam
laced
on
the
glass
aroma
is
quite
floral
almost
grassy
flavour
is
big
on
malt
and
hops
which
balance
themselves
well
in
spite
of
dominating
the
palate
in
no
uncertain
terms
a
tangy
bold
beer
with
much
character
aftertaste
is
dry
and
malty
hops
are
in
evidence
more
to
the
finish
leaving
a
pronounced
bitterness
that
subsides
slowly
ng
poured
out
a
dark
orangecopper
color
reminded
me
of
victorys
moonglow
looks
somewhat
similar
poured
out
a
decent
head
but
went
away
very
quickly
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
of
plums
come
to
mind
also
some
sort
of
sweetness
aroma
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
it
is
exactly
exotic
fruits
cant
be
sure
taste
is
a
little
surprising
at
first
there
seems
to
be
no
body
to
it
but
later
on
theres
a
nice
medium
body
to
it
very
nice
i
like
that
good
malt
backbone
to
this
beer
as
well
theres
a
bitter
aftertaste
as
well
but
in
a
good
way
i
like
how
this
beer
is
put
together
i
can
see
why
rogue
is
proclaimed
i
would
recommend
this
beer
a
hearty
ale
that
is
a
great
selection
on
a
chilly
winter
day
itd
be
hard
to
pair
this
with
food
because
the
taste
is
so
complicated
and
demands
a
great
deal
of
attention
overall
nothing
outstanding
but
can
definitely
do
worse
a
brilliant
brew
by
rouge
one
id
be
glad
to
quaff
any
day
of
the
week
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
was
slightly
dissapointed
i
had
it
about
6
months
ago
before
discovering
ba
and
its
world
of
wonderful
beers
and
i
absolutely
loved
it
im
talking
top
5
beer
material
its
definitely
not
that
anymore
but
still
a
solid
beer
i
will
have
again
rogue
continues
to
impress
had
on
tap
at
redbones
although
i
have
had
it
on
tap
in
the
past
at
other
places
around
beantown
pour
was
a
clear
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
clean
sweet
aroma
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
and
wellrounded
sharp
carbonation
was
also
detected
taste
leaned
towards
the
sweet
and
i
kept
thinking
i
could
pick
up
the
alcohol
in
this
one
a
nice
treat
from
rogue
pat
at
first
i
thought
this
was
a
mild
esb
very
earthy
taste
and
smell
bitterness
all
around
due
to
the
hops
and
the
aroma
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipated
slowly
into
a
light
head
and
eventually
disappeared
with
traces
of
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
bubbly
i
like
the
earthy
aftertaste
its
not
overbearing
like
some
esbs
but
still
keeps
you
aware
of
the
bitterness
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
this
is
one
you
keep
drinking
in
order
to
try
and
figure
it
out
but
with
the
smooth
mouthfeel
giving
way
to
the
bitter
its
almost
as
if
the
beer
is
teasing
you
to
pinpoint
its
definitive
taste
the
bitterness
is
a
mild
but
not
astringent
bitterness
that
i
generally
associate
with
root
vegetables
ill
be
looking
for
this
in
the
bottle
my
boss
actually
purchased
this
beer
about
a
month
ago
for
our
new
office
the
first
thing
i
thought
was
wow
this
taste
just
like
many
solid
octoberfest
beers
huge
malt
background
with
some
citrus
notes
coming
though
malt
clove
earth
raisin
orange
and
nutmeg
flavors
all
coming
through
dry
in
the
end
with
the
flavor
dropping
right
off
a
great
beer
that
i
will
look
for
time
and
time
again
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
serves
as
both
a
single
bottle
sipper
and
as
a
possible
session
beer
even
with
the
rich
malt
quality
i
have
to
start
by
saying
i
really
liked
the
art
on
the
label
that
being
said
this
beer
had
a
great
appearance
poured
a
deep
amber
decent
sized
head
many
bubbles
the
smell
was
nice
too
very
hoppy
almost
reminded
me
of
victory
hop
devil
the
taste
was
also
very
hoppy
a
bit
toasty
and
sweet
the
sweetness
seemed
to
be
well
balanced
with
the
hops
though
if
not
dominated
by
the
hoppiness
mouthfeel
was
good
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
again
defiantly
i
was
extremely
pleased
glad
i
waited
for
tonight
to
have
this
one
a
significant
front
of
hop
bite
gives
way
to
a
very
broad
and
caramel
maltiness
not
cloying
i
guess
at
6
5
this
could
qualify
as
a
bock
alcohol
is
subtle
an
excellent
quaffing
beer
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
i
find
it
highly
drinkable
what
a
rogue
dark
cloudy
amber
was
this
brew
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
diminished
fairly
quickly
but
left
nice
lace
lovely
nose
full
of
malt
and
caramel
hinting
of
a
fruity
hop
overlay
the
taste
is
very
good
being
full
of
malt
but
beautifully
restrained
by
the
clean
fruity
hops
nicely
bitter
and
full
bodied
this
is
creamy
smooth
drinking
beer
easy
drinkability
bottle
deep
copper
colored
brew
with
a
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
skill
complex
mix
of
malts
and
hops
that
is
hard
to
defined
but
easy
to
enjoy
sweet
aroma
and
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
very
good
and
the
bottle
design
is
excellent
will
be
looking
into
trying
more
of
the
rogue
product
this
was
an
interesting
beer
with
a
cool
looking
bottle
poured
a
deep
red
color
with
a
bubbly
head
plum
on
the
nose
the
initial
taste
i
got
from
this
was
plums
some
roasted
caramel
was
noticed
later
more
sweet
fruits
came
and
went
not
too
much
in
the
line
of
hops
but
i
think
thats
because
of
the
style
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
made
it
go
down
easily
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
but
lower
on
the
rogue
totem
pole
of
beers
gorgeous
clear
dark
redamber
color
small
offwhite
dense
thick
foamy
head
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lacing
sweet
deep
malt
creamy
aroma
hops
jump
in
right
away
with
a
touch
of
fruit
deep
almost
chocolatey
malt
takes
over
quickly
creamy
thick
very
bitter
finish
creamy
malt
survives
through
the
end
this
is
a
special
beer
the
huge
hop
bitterness
is
a
little
unexpected
among
the
dark
creamy
malt
its
an
unusual
bimodal
taste
but
a
real
winner
also
my
boys
love
the
bottle
they
want
more
so
we
can
use
them
for
halloween
decorations
in
the
garage
next
year
rogue
can
keep
this
truckin
up
to
buffalo
for
as
long
as
they
want
an
allaround
fine
brew
nice
caramel
color
with
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
nice
lacy
residue
fruity
smell
that
was
not
overwhelming
nice
rounded
feel
with
a
light
sweetness
followed
by
a
slightly
tart
finish
slightly
oily
with
a
medium
to
full
body
some
alcohol
undertones
recommended
refreshing
brew
i
dont
know
if
the
ale
name
is
very
appropriate
seemed
more
like
a
lager
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
good
body
the
high
abv
is
a
bonus
unfortunately
dead
guy
is
too
sweet
for
me
first
time
trying
a
rogue
beer
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
maybe
had
hopes
too
high
but
this
beer
seemed
fairly
average
there
didnt
seem
to
be
anyhting
particularly
compelling
about
this
beer
nothing
up
front
on
the
pallate
nothing
lingering
on
the
back
end
to
make
me
look
forward
to
the
next
bottle
not
that
i
didnt
have
another
though
the
bottle
was
very
cold
to
start
and
the
flavors
opened
up
as
the
beer
warmed
up
i
felt
it
was
a
good
brew
though
and
representative
of
its
style
just
not
a
knockout
pours
a
translucent
copper
color
with
a
monsterous
head
that
is
semicreamy
and
off
white
in
color
a
thick
and
sticky
sheet
of
lace
clings
mightly
to
the
glass
sweet
malt
plum
like
crisp
fresh
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
start
is
ambrosial
thickly
malt
the
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
dynamically
hopped
moderate
acidity
aftertaste
somewhat
bitter
and
long
lasting
a
good
a
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
drinkability
not
a
beer
you
can
chug
nor
would
you
want
to
its
so
tasty
its
gone
before
you
know
it
though
once
the
macro
guys
at
the
halloween
party
got
a
little
pissed
up
enough
to
try
this
they
really
liked
it
beer
advocacy
continues
golden
to
amber
pours
with
a
lot
of
foam
that
slowly
fades
smooth
mouthfeel
body
is
a
little
light
for
a
maibock
the
strength
of
this
brew
is
evident
starts
malty
and
with
notes
of
vanilla
on
the
palate
and
in
the
aroma
malty
with
a
spike
of
hoppiness
towrards
the
finish
and
fairly
bitter
finish
for
a
bock
but
this
is
sort
of
expected
from
a
northwestern
brewery
doesnt
seem
as
balanced
as
it
did
the
other
day
seems
more
bitter
and
the
flavors
seem
just
a
little
brighter
this
dead
guy
still
not
as
lively
as
on
previous
occasions
but
i
guess
you
cant
ask
too
much
from
a
dead
guy
eh
update
i
happened
upon
this
again
in
2010
and
found
it
to
be
much
more
malty
the
malt
base
is
unsweetened
and
very
raw
i
think
really
it
needed
this
to
balance
the
big
hop
bit
its
almost
like
unsweetened
caramel
if
thats
not
an
oxymoron
its
a
solid
4
all
the
way
around
and
a
definite
must
try
for
any
beer
enthusiast
excellent
beer
that
borders
the
boundaries
between
being
a
bock
bier
and
an
esb
cant
really
classify
between
the
two
pours
a
white
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
to
form
a
sticky
lace
with
a
dark
amber
color
slight
citrus
hop
smell
with
goes
along
with
a
caramely
malt
tastes
superb
with
a
slight
toasty
caramely
malt
to
accent
the
hoppiness
a
slight
fruity
ester
flavor
comes
threw
but
is
not
dominating
highly
drinkable
but
alcohol
will
kick
in
after
two
or
so
the
smell
pulled
me
in
a
soft
citrus
smell
prepared
my
sences
for
what
what
was
about
to
come
i
took
a
sip
the
orangeamber
colored
ale
was
just
as
fruity
as
the
smell
had
me
expecting
very
easy
going
down
very
smooth
and
refreshing
i
just
cracked
the
top
off
of
this
one
so
i
could
review
as
i
enjoy
this
nice
label
especially
since
today
is
halloween
this
poured
a
nice
clear
dark
coppergarnet
color
the
head
is
pretty
thin
with
no
lace
around
the
large
goblet
that
im
drinking
it
from
the
aroma
is
pretty
malty
maybe
caramel
with
litter
to
no
hop
presence
the
taste
has
a
large
malt
presence
up
front
with
a
little
brown
sugar
hint
great
finishing
hops
presence
makes
this
one
finish
clean
and
balances
it
out
at
the
end
good
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
and
at
6
5
will
make
a
damn
good
session
beer
great
job
by
rogue
and
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
and
get
the
shakespeare
brutal
this
must
be
the
least
enjoyable
rouge
ale
i
have
had
so
far
it
looks
ok
deep
golden
orange
hue
with
thin
soapy
head
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
toasted
malt
and
domestic
thats
usa
hops
the
flavor
is
just
plain
weird
to
me
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
there
is
something
i
dunno
green
tasting
about
the
combination
of
hoppiness
and
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
sweetish
smoky
flavor
that
continues
with
the
oddness
what
is
most
odd
about
this
ale
is
that
it
is
not
an
ale
at
all
it
is
a
maibock
which
is
a
german
lager
beer
it
is
as
much
an
ale
as
bill
cosby
is
a
young
white
dude
drinkability
a
nice
house
beer
which
has
character
and
somewhat
broad
appeal
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
lasts
fairly
well
and
laces
quite
nicely
aroma
is
lightly
malty
fruity
plums
and
strongly
hoppy
floral
pine
grapefruit
flavor
starts
with
some
dark
fruitiness
and
ends
with
a
very
strongly
hopped
finish
good
bitterness
mediumfull
bodied
light
notes
of
alcohol
poke
through
towards
the
end
im
gonna
run
off
and
tell
all
my
friends
about
this
one
great
beer
very
nice
this
beer
is
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
and
fleeting
tan
head
atop
it
sweet
malts
and
bubblegum
are
what
she
reeks
of
this
is
a
very
sweet
malty
drink
with
the
hops
adding
their
two
cents
in
the
back
seems
like
a
pretty
well
put
together
beer
not
my
all
time
favorite
though
drinkability
one
a
day
wouldnt
be
too
much
a
pleasant
everyday
drinker
dark
copper
in
color
quickly
dissipating
head
very
nice
sweet
sugary
malty
aromas
with
hints
of
tropical
fruits
lightly
toasted
sweet
malts
up
front
with
more
sweet
malts
in
the
middle
then
a
kiss
of
hops
flowery
hops
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
a
great
and
very
drinkable
brew
the
rogue
guys
continue
to
impress
while
this
is
not
a
great
beer
and
slightly
deflates
the
rogue
mystique
i
still
like
it
it
actually
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
fullers
esb
though
i
find
it
a
little
less
silky
a
beige
head
settles
fast
upon
pouring
over
a
very
dark
amber
body
it
smells
of
hops
which
although
not
overwhelming
are
very
present
it
is
not
as
bitter
as
some
other
ales
but
it
remains
very
potent
it
is
not
a
thick
ale
and
goes
down
smooth
i
like
drinking
this
on
occasion
and
am
happy
it
is
not
a
seasonal
brew
i
wish
i
was
able
to
find
a
larger
variety
of
rogue
brews
around
my
area
but
alas
it
is
mostly
dead
guy
ale
this
beer
is
a
pleasing
copper
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
chill
haze
to
it
it
pours
with
a
frothy
cream
to
tan
colored
head
the
main
aroma
is
one
of
a
malty
biscuit
it
is
accompanied
by
a
sweet
hoppiness
this
beer
is
very
malty
tasting
and
lightly
sweet
i
must
say
this
is
a
great
session
beer
lots
of
flavor
yet
it
seems
to
be
relatively
light
a
beer
for
when
you
arent
up
to
being
assaulted
by
hop
varieties
and
dense
maltiness
this
beer
finishes
with
a
balancing
bitterness
that
counterpoints
the
wonderful
mixture
of
sweet
maltiness
and
hop
flavors
that
are
at
the
front
part
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
what
i
wish
fat
tire
was
i
know
it
is
a
bit
hypocritical
but
i
can
still
wish
drinkability
quite
drinkable
im
glad
they
make
this
year
round
so
i
dont
have
to
wait
for
the
fall
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
now
and
its
always
so
hard
to
nail
down
i
always
enjoy
it
but
it
doesnt
leap
out
in
any
way
subtelty
in
a
rogue
imagine
that
starts
off
quite
sweet
and
malty
almost
too
much
so
by
the
end
the
trademark
rogue
hops
are
prevalent
in
between
however
a
nice
unique
ale
good
balance
good
taste
good
drinkability
good
beer
im
glad
this
is
available
again
at
one
of
my
local
beer
stores
a
nice
change
light
amber
color
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
maltyfruity
and
sweet
a
medium
bodied
hellesbock
ale
fairly
malty
yet
with
a
nice
strong
hop
bite
some
hop
spiciness
smooth
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
crisp
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
pours
an
amber
color
with
some
orange
hues
and
a
moderate
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
but
there
were
some
slight
hops
and
a
little
citrus
present
the
flavor
was
sweet
and
malty
good
combination
the
flavor
is
fairly
smooth
but
not
perfect
it
could
be
a
little
more
smooth
the
mouthfeel
was
average
in
my
book
seemed
like
a
fairly
average
beer
to
me
poured
a
little
on
the
cloudy
side
but
cleared
as
it
warmed
there
was
a
sweet
malt
scent
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
start
was
somewhat
malty
sweet
but
then
the
hops
kick
in
with
a
dry
citrusy
grapefruit
finish
as
with
the
finish
the
aftertaste
was
on
the
bitter
side
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
creamy
with
a
light
to
medium
body
and
slight
carbonation
well
balanced
but
over
all
the
flavors
are
a
bit
subdued
this
is
a
good
brew
that
is
quite
drinkable
yet
it
didnt
seem
to
stand
out
too
much
to
me
would
probably
be
an
all
around
good
beer
that
even
nonbas
might
enjoy
overall
impression
rouge
has
done
it
again
an
outstanding
beer
drinkability
is
unsurpassed
leaves
a
dry
finish
that
triggers
an
almost
instinctual
next
sip
and
a
great
taste
that
rewards
the
impulse
im
starting
to
run
low
someone
help
a
pretty
good
beer
that
went
well
with
the
clam
chowder
i
had
wouldnt
particularly
drink
it
as
a
thirst
quencher
but
the
beer
is
very
nice
tell
your
friends
if
you
dont
know
now
you
know
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
hell
whether
or
not
it
adheres
to
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
rogue
has
to
offer
this
proves
they
can
do
subtle
as
well
as
they
do
bold
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
a
frothy
offwhite
head
aromas
are
all
light
and
subduedsweet
hoppy
grassy
inviting
if
nothing
else
everything
else
is
all
she
wrote
there
is
a
perfect
balance
of
the
malt
and
hop
profile
and
neither
is
over
done
although
each
dominate
at
different
times
tastes
sweetraisins
followed
by
the
smoothest
hops
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
could
and
have
drink
this
all
night
and
i
usually
opt
for
variety
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
on
tap
again
this
bock
poured
a
cloudyhazy
amberbrown
with
hints
of
red
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
spicy
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
caramel
and
spicy
hops
near
the
finish
nicely
balanced
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
but
dry
and
hoppy
almost
chalky
at
the
finish
and
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
low
this
was
a
very
tasty
bock
on
tap
ive
heard
so
much
about
this
brew
that
i
just
had
to
try
it
when
i
saw
a
big
bottle
of
it
at
a
local
market
it
poured
a
nice
slightly
murky
reddish
orange
with
minimal
head
yet
ample
sticky
lace
coating
the
glass
throughout
attractive
fruitiness
and
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
little
cooking
caramel
as
well
the
taste
of
this
baby
is
really
quite
nice
lots
of
caramel
malt
flavors
and
a
slick
buttery
texture
that
finds
balance
in
nice
grainy
maltyhoppy
interaction
this
beer
is
superbly
balanced
and
very
flavorfull
im
picking
up
more
of
that
caramel
corn
thing
as
i
finish
this
beer
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
and
as
i
drink
more
of
it
it
becomes
even
more
drinkable
i
would
not
call
it
a
refresher
yet
i
would
call
it
a
damn
good
turn
on
the
ac
and
kick
back
in
the
chaise
lounge
summer
sipper
this
was
another
selection
at
the
old
chicago
in
phoenix
appearance
is
reddishorange
making
in
quite
interesting
as
opposed
to
a
disappointing
pour
which
did
not
leave
much
of
a
head
the
smells
detected
were
of
malts
and
a
slight
fruit
odor
the
taste
is
interesting
nothing
like
i
have
had
before
had
a
good
mouth
feel
overall
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
bit
pricy
as
it
asks
for
a
stone
brewing
price
but
does
not
deliver
the
same
caliber
of
beer
flavor
is
bold
and
powerful
yet
smooth
and
rich
the
beer
starts
out
malty
sweet
fading
into
a
slight
toasty
graininess
then
travels
into
a
moderate
northwest
hopping
finishing
the
beer
malts
remain
throughout
the
sip
finishing
with
the
hops
wonderfully
hints
of
apple
pear
and
plum
heavy
body
with
mild
smooth
carbonation
a
touch
of
cookielike
yeastiness
nice
and
complex
flavor
changing
and
melding
throughout
the
sip
one
of
the
best
flagship
beers
in
my
opinion
not
sure
how
i
found
this
beer
in
atlanta
georgia
supposedly
has
a
beer
alcohol
limit
of
6
the
color
is
honey
caramel
maybe
even
orange
theres
a
slight
floral
almost
sweetcitrus
aroma
although
this
beer
feels
thin
in
the
mouth
its
almost
flat
perhaps
i
need
to
have
a
few
more
to
be
sure
the
malthop
balance
is
very
nice
this
is
an
extremely
easy
drinking
beer
this
will
be
a
beer
that
i
drink
by
the
pool
or
while
lounging
on
the
deck
or
watching
a
ballgame
if
i
can
keep
finding
it
in
the
atl
dead
guy
poured
a
dark
red
maybe
slightly
brownish
color
a
bit
cloudy
it
also
had
a
nice
fluffy
head
not
a
very
active
appearance
but
deep
and
serious
the
smell
was
quite
interesting
a
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
sweetness
underlying
it
all
nice
honey
traces
the
taste
was
a
bit
strange
but
i
got
used
to
it
pretty
quickly
the
initial
sweetness
is
tempered
by
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
different
than
most
beers
even
most
maibocks
that
i
can
remember
the
full
mouthfeel
was
very
appropriate
and
matched
the
complexity
of
the
beer
very
well
good
taste
and
good
drinking
overall
the
alcohol
can
sneak
up
on
you
a
little
but
this
makes
for
a
great
standby
and
a
good
session
maibock
one
of
my
current
standbys
a
very
good
beer
its
a
lovely
color
in
the
glass
the
head
isnt
quite
as
pure
white
as
a
lot
of
other
beers
which
gives
it
a
good
feel
not
every
beer
has
to
have
a
snowwhite
froth
floating
on
top
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
surprisingly
easily
on
top
of
all
this
a
jollly
beerswilling
skeleton
on
the
label
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
bottle
designs
of
all
time
highly
recommended
notes
impressive
session
brew
drinkability
maybe
i
got
a
lessthanfresh
pint
ill
give
this
beer
points
for
being
wellbalanced
but
i
felt
that
it
was
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
to
the
point
that
ill
either
a
not
touch
it
again
or
b
go
back
and
get
another
and
adjust
this
review
if
necessary
the
beer
pours
an
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
laces
nicely
the
aroma
is
fruity
there
are
hints
of
pale
malts
and
yeast
the
taste
is
also
good
there
is
a
sweetness
about
it
that
stays
with
you
until
it
finishes
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
thats
lowmed
bodied
and
carbonated
just
right
this
is
a
great
sessions
beer
rogue
has
done
it
again
bronzered
colored
smell
is
slighty
hoppy
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
just
enough
hoppiness
to
keep
it
spicy
but
not
too
much
for
my
palate
very
appetizing
and
enjoyable
a
great
session
beer
on
a
summer
evening
recommended
it
drinks
extremely
easy
maybe
too
easy
it
is
fresh
and
finishes
nice
i
just
have
to
say
a
comendable
job
on
creating
this
easy
drinking
ale
this
beer
was
a
nice
copper
brown
color
with
a
mediumsized
creamy
head
its
taste
included
a
caramel
maltiness
and
was
different
from
a
lot
of
beers
i
have
had
before
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
and
id
definately
drink
this
beer
again
and
often
overall
impression
i
guess
this
is
rogues
onesizefitsall
beer
and
i
have
to
admit
i
do
like
it
most
the
beers
ive
tried
from
rogue
were
just
too
heavy
on
the
hops
this
one
is
more
balanced
so
its
no
wonder
it
has
more
wideranging
appeal
i
found
this
particular
beer
to
have
both
a
bitter
taste
and
an
after
taste
as
well
after
just
a
few
sips
of
this
beer
i
could
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
effects
all
in
all
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
tried
the
rogue
in
me
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
whether
its
a
lager
or
an
ale
its
a
good
beer
and
one
i
will
have
again
nice
hoppy
aroma
this
brew
formed
a
nice
medium
head
without
too
much
carbonation
it
lasted
only
a
short
while
though
and
left
an
excellent
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
it
is
a
cloudy
light
orange
brown
color
it
has
a
slight
aftertaste
but
is
still
on
the
mild
side
a
nice
drinkable
but
unimpressive
beer
beautiful
color
in
glass
deep
red
with
a
little
orange
not
much
head
to
speak
of
and
very
little
head
retention
the
only
dissappointment
i
had
hoppy
and
slightly
sweet
bouquet
the
flavor
was
hoppy
and
delicious
with
a
definately
sweet
malty
round
undercurrent
drinkable
and
delectable
poured
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
it
bears
a
resemblence
of
liquid
twilight
a
beautiful
hazy
copper
tone
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
recedes
to
a
frothy
ring
aroma
is
complex
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
fruit
some
citrus
definitely
some
honey
floral
hops
a
touch
earthy
flavour
is
bold
sweet
and
bitter
and
oily
all
at
once
difficult
to
pick
anything
out
on
its
own
it
all
blends
in
if
this
is
a
standard
of
whats
to
come
then
i
salute
the
rogue
in
each
of
us
as
well
another
winner
from
rogue
poured
this
one
and
saw
only
a
little
lacy
head
on
one
side
the
glass
virtually
none
at
all
a
thick
amber
colored
beer
looked
almost
like
a
jar
of
mountain
honey
in
my
frosty
mug
lots
of
smell
coming
from
this
one
fruit
a
very
satisfying
mixture
of
taste
that
is
at
first
sweet
then
that
little
bit
of
rogue
bitterness
that
makes
a
nice
finish
a
unique
brew
that
is
always
in
my
fridge
on
draught
appearance
hazy
honey
colored
w
a
medium
white
head
it
has
a
malty
taste
up
front
w
a
bit
of
a
funky
tart
finish
maybe
grapefruit
or
lemon
unique
to
be
sure
its
definitely
different
and
a
musttry
for
any
serious
beer
lovers
list
i
really
like
this
beer
dark
copper
color
paired
with
a
deliciously
creamy
head
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
malts
and
flowery
hops
taste
is
fronted
by
sweetness
followed
and
balanced
nicely
by
hops
tastes
like
a
maibock
extremely
drinkablewatch
out
sixpack
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bw3
downtown
indy
poured
a
clear
redorange
with
a
moderate
head
that
didnt
last
long
some
signs
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
almost
too
sweet
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
something
i
could
drink
alot
of
at
one
time
because
of
the
sweetness
but
still
an
over
all
good
beer
almost
exceptional
appearance
maintained
a
huge
head
for
awhile
before
it
faded
leaving
spotty
lace
and
a
thin
white
head
floral
fruit
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
color
is
an
orange
to
amber
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
and
taste
the
bitterness
makes
no
attempt
to
hide
itself
fruity
taste
thats
dry
but
not
too
refreshing
it
is
strong
at
6
5
and
that
might
limit
drinkability
smooth
mouthfeel
thats
clean
and
crisp
complex
and
wellcrafted
with
a
great
reputation
a
bit
odd
similiar
in
taste
to
golden
syrup
a
bit
too
sticky
quite
sticky
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
salt
at
the
end
kinda
like
a
bock
just
with
a
bit
more
hops
that
id
usually
expect
in
one
very
odd
flavours
didnt
mold
well
at
all
probably
my
least
favourite
from
a
night
of
tasting
many
great
us
beers
i
had
this
brew
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
an
orangishred
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
was
just
a
little
weak
it
smelled
of
citrus
and
hops
a
little
bit
the
taste
is
a
good
mix
of
fruit
and
hops
and
is
very
well
balanced
it
is
a
very
soothing
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
tad
bit
oily
the
drinkability
is
great
and
this
is
a
pretty
unique
ale
drinkability
is
nearly
perfect
and
this
is
a
wonderful
session
pairing
or
convert
beer
a
great
all
around
offering
but
would
you
expect
anything
less
from
rogue
good
carbonation
strong
taste
with
slight
bitterness
and
lingering
aftertaste
a
nice
looking
copper
colored
beer
with
good
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
caramel
malty
with
a
little
hoppiness
thrown
in
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
beer
nice
blend
of
herbal
hops
with
sweet
caramel
malts
real
nice
balance
and
an
appropriately
medium
mouthfeel
rogue
always
satisfies
i
could
have
sworn
this
was
a
pale
ale
but
the
category
shows
that
it
is
not
pours
a
nice
coppery
amber
color
nice
head
with
good
retention
beautiful
floral
hops
and
malt
balance
the
finish
is
just
as
good
alcohol
is
there
too
but
not
up
front
mouthfeel
starts
out
velvety
and
finishes
a
little
dry
makes
you
want
more
im
finding
that
this
beer
is
winning
me
over
as
i
drink
it
at
first
seems
a
bit
too
fruity
for
my
tastes
but
as
i
drink
it
the
complexity
starts
to
present
itself
along
with
the
hops
its
like
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
but
i
know
i
want
more
yes
its
extremely
drinkable
this
sixpack
wont
last
long
it
seems
a
bit
hoppy
for
a
maibock
but
im
not
really
complaining
its
like
an
esb
with
a
really
firm
malt
backbone
ive
had
a
few
of
these
now
and
i
just
love
this
beer
no
matter
what
you
call
it
its
darn
tasty
had
this
on
tap
at
the
sunset
cantina
color
was
a
clear
light
copper
hue
and
the
head
was
white
fine
and
thin
but
with
minimal
lacing
nose
displayed
some
citrusy
hop
notes
and
even
seemed
a
bit
grassy
to
me
body
was
better
than
medium
with
a
slight
prickliness
on
the
tongue
flavor
was
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
malt
was
slightly
toasty
with
some
sweetness
but
not
enough
for
me
and
the
hops
were
pleasing
with
a
citrus
lean
to
them
good
stuff
brilliant
amber
color
with
a
large
two
inch
fluff
atop
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
and
a
treat
to
throw
back
its
creamy
sweet
and
then
spicy
sharp
hops
caramel
malty
and
then
sharp
hops
an
awesome
session
beer
that
is
stronger
than
one
would
imagine
this
is
most
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
one
of
my
fallback
brews
pours
a
beauty
of
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
retaining
head
some
fruity
and
hops
are
noted
on
the
aroma
barely
detectable
a
spicy
hoppy
taste
is
noted
on
top
with
some
underlying
malts
and
some
citrus
detected
medium
bodied
and
hopped
up
as
expected
from
rogue
all
in
all
an
above
average
beer
that
can
have
some
bite
great
rusty
bronze
color
with
creamy
white
head
head
didnt
stay
long
and
lace
was
minimal
the
aroma
smelled
like
a
kettle
of
carmel
when
you
melt
it
to
make
carmel
apples
and
a
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
smell
came
through
nicely
the
taste
was
rich
and
smooth
pronounced
carmel
flavor
with
a
bittersweet
middle
and
a
pleasant
sweet
and
tart
finish
that
lingered
a
bit
an
excellent
maibock
style
beer
my
first
rogue
all
killer
no
filler
lightly
drying
but
with
an
obviously
bitter
finish
it
didnt
diminish
the
very
wet
feeling
the
watery
mouthfeel
left
for
most
of
my
tongue
a
good
session
beer
light
relative
to
most
rogue
offerings
yet
interesting
i
thought
better
in
bottle
as
for
me
the
draught
had
lost
its
malt
flavors
and
thus
its
balance
dark
amber
a
little
hazy
with
an
orangey
head
that
is
thick
and
lingering
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
ripe
fruit
some
toffee
and
candy
flavor
is
coarse
brown
sugar
ripe
pear
and
hint
of
butterscotch
also
a
bit
of
a
roughedged
flavor
a
little
grainy
mouthfeel
is
round
and
full
with
even
carbonation
you
can
just
feel

this
is
a
terrific
beer
for
any
hop
head
but
one
that
i
think
any
beer
drinker
would
enjoy
as
this
beer
showcases
the
floralcitrus
aspects
of
the
hops
with
out
leaving
too
much
of
a
bitter
bite
very
nice
pours
a
reddish
brown
not
much
head
to
the
beer
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
very
complex
there
are
a
great
deal
of
malts
and
hops
in
this
beer
but
neither
are
overwhelming
but
there
is
a
good
hop
kick
in
the
end
extremely
well
balanced
this
one
would
get
the
mayans
to
come
back
from
the
dead
big
misconception
that
this
was
named
for
jerry
garcia
it
was
named
for
a
mayan
celebration
it
does
sell
beers
since
they
dont
readily
discount
it
if
you
see
this
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
pint
i
suggest
it
to
all
newbies
and
i
get
great
response
enjoy
this
is
the
sweetest
juice
of
god
it
has
a
beautiful
deep
golden
amber
color
shimmering
with
deliciousness
aroma
is
of
bold
malts
wrapped
in
a
loving
bouquet
of
hops
i
do
not
catch
any
of
the
fruit
other
see
but
this
has
the
rich
warm
qualities
of
fresh
baked
bread
a
firm
hop
back
bone
that
make
me
glad
i
was
born
the
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
is
liquid
silk
quite
a
treat
here
copper
red
color
with
a
pale
orange
hue
initially
fluffy
then
disappates
into
an
offwhite
head
that
resembles
a
flat
cloud
in
shape
sweet
and
mellow
candlylike
scent
flavor
initially
is
slightly
bitter
but
soon
transforms
on
the
tongue
to
a
mellow
sweetness
just
a
plethora
of
different
sweetnesses
confused
and
excite
the
tongue
and
palate
aftertaste
almost
has
an
element
of
carmel
too
it
any
taste
of
alcohol
is
nonexistant
in
this
brew
carbonation
is
light
which
allows
for
all
the
flavor
to
come
out
extremely
drinkable
a
nice
appetizer
beer
because
once
its
gone
you
want
another
and
another
and
another
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
head
bubbles
efervesced
throughout
the
duration
of
the
beer
in
my
glass
lace
was
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
you
get
a
good
whiff
of
alcohol
almost
vodkalike
with
my
bottle
interesting
the
taste
is
very
good
and
satisfies
the
hophead
in
me
little
malt
presence
on
the
palate
followed
by
bitter
hops
and
a
crisp
finish
it
feels
to
me
that
the
tail
end
is
almost
missing
something
maybe
im
delusional
this
is
a
very
rich
ale
for
my
tastes
so
i
can
see
drinking
one
or
two
of
these
tasty
brews
but
certainly
not
more
than
that
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
recently
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
it
poured
a
nice
head
that
laced
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
the
thing
about
it
that
impressed
me
the
most
was
that
despite
its
intense
hops
the
malt
flavor
came
right
through
this
is
american
brewing
at
its
best
a
bock
but
they
call
it
an
ale
i
dont
understand
a
very
good
bock
one
of
my
favorite
bocks
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
very
much
of
but
very
good
none
the
less
balance
is
good
nice
malt
profile
i
welcome
this
beer
into
my
fridge
great
label
the
beer
has
a
nice
body
to
it
and
the
alcohol
content
is
hidden
making
it
dangerous
if
you
think
it
is
a
session
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
drinkability
i
really
wasnt
constantly
ready
for
another
drink
with
this
one
not
a
beer
that
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
this
stuff
is
great
pours
an
orangeish
hue
with
a
white
head
it
tastes
like
a
nutty
amber
but
it
works
no
massive
hops
yet
a
subtle
transformation
of
a
classic
which
yields
an
awesome
offspring
any
fan
of
ales
would
enjoy
this
tastey
interpretation
overall
i
will
get
some
more
not
my
favorite
but
still
good
nice
looking
deep
golden
brew
with
a
level
offwhite
head
that
died
in
a
hurry
smell
is
a
mix
of
english
and
american
bitter
hops
but
i
once
this
tasted
a
few
more
flavors
kicked
in
most
notably
a
very
sweet
maltiness
nothing
overpowering
just
a
decent
balance
of
hops
sweet
bready
malts
alcohol
is
totally
hidden
not
the
best
maibock
ive
head
but
pretty
good
amber
in
color
light
tan
small
bubbly
half
inch
thick
head
very
appealing
to
look
at
smells
of
light
floral
hops
and
yeast
start
and
middle
are
a
little
bit
empty
but
ohh
the
finish
is
so
nice
good
fair
amount
of
hops
with
a
nice
dry
hop
bite
sip
or
drink
it
slow
its
quite
smooth
with
a
nice
hop
bite
drink
it
fast
and
watch
out
the
hop
bite
bites
has
a
light
body
feel
and
leaves
a
dry
hop
tang
in
mouth
and
tongue
drinkable
indeed
this
is
a
nice
clean
hophead
ale
for
sure
poured
and
amber
color
topped
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
excellent
retention
not
much
aroma
a
little
malty
sweetness
carbonation
is
low
giving
this
brew
a
smooth
mouthfeel
malts
dominate
the
flavor
a
little
raison
notes
not
too
bad
overall
but
not
the
best
rogue
has
to
offer
character
is
a
just
a
little
lacking
something
that
some
of
rogues
other
brews
have
that
makes
them
stand
out
but
hey
when
the
day
of
the
dead
comes
what
better
than
a
dead
guy
presented
in
a
22oz
bomber
bottle
with
the
classic
dead
guy
sitting
on
a
barrel
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
maibocks
pours
a
deep
amberbronze
color
topped
off
by
a
medium
sized
bubbly
head
nose
is
floral
and
malty
with
slight
undertones
of
nuts
and
fruit
bitter
hops
are
immediately
recognized
upon
first
taste
followed
by
a
sweet
fruitiness
and
malts
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
very
nice
another
great
beer
from
rogue
nice
rich
gold
color
with
creamy
head
that
stayed
nicelysmelled
nice
and
malty
with
some
fruitiness

it

not
overly
sweet
but
enjoyably
sweethop
is
in
there
after
a
few
sips
it
shows
drink
this
one
alot
really
good
beer
with
some
balls
comments
very
flavorful
brew
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
dead
finish
provides
an
interesting
effect
thank
you
keith
stegmakk
for
the
bottle
poured
a
hazy
wheathoney
type
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
that
thins
out
and
leaves
a
lacy
coat
on
top
the
aroma
is
not
strong
at
all
but
you
can
smell
the
hops
and
light
malt
there
was
a
slight
bitter
malt
aftertaste
that
is
not
overpowering
and
completes
the
initial
hop
taste
there
is
a
smooth
mouth
feel
to
this
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
grab
another
and
another
and
another
the
drinkability
is
great
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
want
on
a
hot
summer
night
when
youre
relaxing
at
home
with
some
friends
having
a
good
conversation
about
beer
and
life
this
is
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
dangerously
drinkable
a
12
oz
bottle
gives
me
a
pleasant
buzz
on
an
empty
stomach
delicious
somewhat
of
a
dessert
beer
this
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
real
cask
ale
at
its
prime
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
in
my
top
20
on
tap
at
the
rogue
ale
house
this
is
just
sublime
you
can
drink
a
truck
full
of
this
and
still
like
it
another
great
offering
from
rogue
this
tasty
mai
bock
was
originally
created
to
celebrate
the
mayan
day
of
the
dead
or
dia
de
muerto
on
november
2
all
souls
day
pours
a
hazy
medium
orange
with
a
white
foamy
head
nice
citrusy
buttery
aroma
with
a
hoppy
floral
boquette
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
which
is
thick
and
creamy
smooth
front
with
a
crisp
textured
finish
sweet
and
citrusy
upfront
with
a
biscuity
malt
goodness
flavorful
finish
from
the
saaz
hops
is
just
perfect
i
picked
up
a
single
bottle
to
sample
and
now
i
wish
i
had
grabbed
a
sixpack
for
some
reason
this
reminds
me
of
an
outstanding
homebrewed
beer
probably
the
hazy
appearance
and
the
rich
natural
flavours
true
craftbrewed
excellence
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
copper
hue
with
an
off
white
fluffy
billowing
head
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
thickest
lace
but
what
it
lacks
there
it
makes
up
with
in
taste
and
aroma
aroma
is
a
sharp
sweetness
with
notes
of
caramel
and
slight
apple
tartness
the
flavor
is
very
complex
yet
simply
amazing
in
every
way
this
beer
blends
the
perfect
amount
of
subtle
bittering
hops
with
a
huge
blend
of
specialty
malts
gotta
love
the
maibock
brewed
with
ale
yeast
instead
of
the
standard
lager
yeast
for
the
style
this
shows
that
taking
a
chance
can
bring
you
an
awesome
product
like
the
one
i
have
the
pleasure
of
sipping
on
right
now
there
are
hints
is
a
soft
chewy
mouthfeel
that
carries
a
plethora
of
caramel
malt
a
ver
slight
tartness
and
the
trace
of
hop
character
tie
this
beer
together
no
loose
ends
here
one
amazing
totally
solid
brew
that
is
so
easy
to
drink
if
i
see
this
stuff
on
tap
it
is
going
to
be
quite
a
fun
night
very
good
drinkable
brew
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
had
not
had
any
rogue
products
prior
to
this
and
i
hope
all
of
this
live
up
to
dead
guys
near
perfection
imho
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
to
drink
at
any
time
whether
at
the
bar
or
with
food
very
reliable
brew
the
pour
was
silky
smooth
with
an
attractive
red
orange
color
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
unsubstantial
white
head
that
formed
clingy
lace
the
smell
was
a
balance
of
malt
and
hops
but
was
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
the
taste
was
not
however
it
was
full
with
some
citrus
flavors
and
notes
of
apple
and
bitter
malts
yet
another
quality
effort
from
rogue
pretty
dang
good
i
can
see
it
becoming
my
fallback
brew
taste
this
is
how
bock
beer
ought
to
taste
a
onetwo
punch
malt
and
plenty
of
it
just
start
to
taste
the
sweet
of
it
when
pow
the
hops
hit
you
plenty
but
not
too
much
hops
luscious
short
to
medium
finish
a
wonderful
brew
more
please
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
id
have
this
one
again
and
again
and
again
a
pretty
good
brew
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
white
lace
nose
is
sweet
with
obvious
malt
and
hops
initial
taste
is
malt
sweetness
but
this
is
quickly
followed
by
hop
bitterness
that
ends
with
a
nutty
sweetness
fairly
smooth
and
mediumbodied
a
great
ale
and
rather
warming
id
have
to
say
ill
come
back
to
this
one
a
genuinely
delightful
beer
pours
sunset
orange
in
color
with
a
mountainous
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
great
lace
down
the
glass
what
rogue
beer
doesnt
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
honeylike
scent
and
an
aroma
of
tropical
fruit
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
medium
full
body
the
flavor
is
mostly
malty
with
some
muted
fruity
flavors
a
breadcrust
like
finish
and
some
piney
and
floral
hop
flavors
which
lend
it
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
terifically
complex
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
when
i
saw
the
name
of
this
brew
on
the
menu
as
on
draft
at
my
local
ct
upscale
diner
i
figured
it
was
a
local
ipa
or
pale
ale
of
some
sort
how
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
when
it
arrived
at
the
table
and
was
confused
as
to
what
type
of
beer
it
was
as
it
did
not
adhere
to
either
style
when
i
got
home
i
punched
it
in
at
the
beeradvocate
website
and
found
it
was
from
rogue
which
i
havent
been
able
to
get
in
any
of
my
local
stores
here
in
new
england
as
far
as
the
beer
goes
it
did
not
have
the
metallic
taste
i
associate
with
other
rogue
products
ive
had
the
malt
was
a
honeyish
variety
with
the
hops
being
ever
present
but
not
overtly
spicy
the
body
was
nicely
constructed
with
the
head
playing
a
strong
part
in
the
experience
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
i
was
driving
i
could
easily
have
sat
there
and
sampled
more
a
good
beer
and
one
i
will
try
and
find
to
have
in
the
house
this
brew
pours
a
murky
deep
brownishorange
with
a
light
beige
head
that
reduces
to
a
cap
the
smell
is
very
unique
floral
heavy
waves
of
candied
fruit
chocolate
and
dark
caramel
the
taste
is
of
burnt
caramel
chocolate
malted
milk
balls
plum
preserves
and
raisins
though
lighterbodied
and
less
potent
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
the
sample
of
samichlaus
i
tried
not
too
long
ago
unfortunately
some
odd
metallic
taste
comes
on
in
the
finish
contributing
to
an
unpleasant
bitterness
i
think
my
bottle
might
be
an
old
one
and
i
know
it
was
not
stored
at
cellar
temperatures
prior
to
my
purchase
even
so
i
could
tell
this
was
a
good
beer
past
its
prime
i
will
have
to
try
to
locate
a
fresher
sample
this
brew
poured
a
deep
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
aroma
was
slightly
citrus
with
a
flowery
hint
the
taste
was
malty
up
front
with
a
sweet
middle
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
to
finish
it
off
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
which
gives
the
beer
a
slight
warming
effect
this
beer
had
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
i
will
have
to
puchase
this
beer
again

the

this
was
a

poured

the
taste
was
awesome
with

to

it

for
this

taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
on
the
swallow
but
not
too
much
i
really
like
this
brewery
taste
the
sweetnes
and
fruitness
that
is
present
in
the
aroma
of
the
beer
if
very
evident
in
the
flavor
as
well
almost
too
much
so
for
my
tastes
i
prefer
more
bitterness
and
less
sweetness
in
my
beers
so
for
that
reason
this
brew
did
not
score
higher
all
that
said
this
wasnt
an
unpleasant
beer
just
not
the
one
for
me
i
did
suck
it
down
rather
quickly
though
which
led
to
the
higher
drinkability
rating
this
beer
came
to
me
at
the
table
an
amber
color
with
hints
of
red
and
yellowhoney
when
held
to
the
light
some
cloud
but
you
could
see
through
it
the
head
was
an
off
whitebeige
color
that
seemed
to
have
some
stability
to
it
lace
was
present
on
the
sides
of

was

at

that
is
what
the

stated
i
noted
fruit
sweet

bit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
they
all
just
danced
around
my
tongue
like
it
was
on
vacation
and
after
the
last
sip
i
heard
a
slight
sigh
from
inside
my
mouth
i
swear
because
it
knew
that
the
last
sip
was
indeed
the
last
sip
and
i
had
to
leave
so
i
bought
2
bottles
to
take
home
one
to
drink
and
one
larger
one
to
save
because
i
loved
the
painted
label
on
the
bottle
simple
but
classy
plus
i
like
stuff
like
that
if
someone
who
has
never
had
this
beer
and
reads
this
stop
reading
and
go
get
some
still
not
bad
and
enjoyable
but
ive
got
many
other
beers
that
i
would
rather
drink
first
good
but
not
outstanding
pours
a
clear
amber
with
fair
head
little
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
moderate
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hops
noticable
slightly
sweet
with
a
medium
thickness
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
really
grabs
me
will
definitly
put
a
few
more
away
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
give
it
a
try
cool
label
pours
predominanantly
amber
but
slightly
golden
medium
carbonation
and
thick
frothy
clingy
head
slithgly
fruity
aroma
mixed
with
some
spicyness
aroma
is
not
overwhelming
but
definately
there
taste
is
a
malty
fruityness
that
is
rounded
out
with
spicey
hop
flavor
it
is
complex
its
a
bit
heavier
than
i
expected
but
thats
fine
the
heaviness
and
body
make
it
difficult
to
drink
a
number
of
these
even
though
you
really
would
like
to
i
will
definetly
have
another
and
cant
wait
for
more
from
rogue
i
think
the
mocha
porter
will
be
next
but
ill
see
man
what
a
beer
it
poured
with
a
deep
honey
color
and
a
very
nice
and
creamy
tan
head
yum
the
aroma
was
great
i
can
find
the
all
the
words
to
express
myself
but
lets
start
with
spicy
malt
fruity
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
long
awaited
and
well
worth
the
wait
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
tones
of
fruit
bounce
off
your
tongue
mouth
feel
and
drink
ability
are
great
i
was
well
pleased
with
this
ale
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
im
looking
forward
to
try
more
rouge
beers
an
interesting
beer
a
maibock
style
ale
definitely
still
tastes
like
an
ale
fruity
maltiness
is
present
along
with
a
buttery
texture
caramel
like
flavor
at
first
great
floral
hop
flavor
a
great
fruityforal
hop
mix
on
the
nose
i
dont
really
see
too
many
maibock
characteristics
but
this
is
a
good
beverage
a
brilliant
orange
in
color
this
is
a
solid
ale
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
sometime
another
winner
from
rogue
and
as
usual
they
shun
traditional
guidelines
to
make
a
delicious
brew
all
hail
dead
guy
long
may
he
rest
this
is
one
amazing
beer
i
usually
try
to
stay
away
from
american
brews
from
the
few
i
have
tasted
but
this
is
one
good
beer
its
full
of
flavour
and
kinda
floral
smell
for
those
of
u
who
love
a
beer
with
a
strong
flavour
this
is
it
its
got
hints
of
fruit
and
slight
molassas
which
i
like
very
much
the
only
real
complaint
i
have
is
that
i
wish
it
had
a
bigger
head
that
retained
itself
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
the
appearance
is
very
nice
giving
a
orangered
cloudy
color
i
will
definatly
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
again
good
looking
beer
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
malty
smell
thats
really
pleasant
the
first
sip
did
not
dissapoint
held
its
own
until
the
end
very
drinkable
i
will
be
buying
more
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
a
delicious
combination
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
light
sweet
fruit
nice
indeed
the
taste
replicates
the
aromas
making
for
a
nice
complex
mix
with
the
just
the
right
amout
of
hops
with
a
lightdry
finish
to
make
this
one
superb
brew
it
has
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
drinks
down
pretty
easy
damned
good
brew
pineywoodsrooter
donated
a
few
of
these
to
me
brought
up
from
houston
thanks
cheers
i
dont
know
if
i
had
a
bad
one
or
something
but
i
wasnt
that
inpressed
with
it
it
was
the
last
one
on
the
fridge
shelf
so
i
guess
it
was
old
even
though
it
was
probably
old
it
was
still
good
i
wouldnt
give
it
the
best
review
but
i
also
wouldnt
give
it
a
bad
review
or
an
average
review
because
it
was
better
than
average
it
had
an
overbearing
alcoholy
taste
to
it
which
i
dont
really
dig
if
it
were
fresher
im
sure
it
would
have
been
better
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
amble
thick
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
rind
the
lace
is
minimal
roasted
malt
is
the
dominant
smell
but
there
is
a
fruity
smell
that
i
dont
recognize
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
for
my
taste
but
is
still
quite
enjoyable
it
starts
out
slightly
sweet
but
turns
bitter
the
finish
is
quite
pleasant
this
is
an
all
around
good
maibock
this
beer
is
a
little
heavy
to
drink
more
than
3
or
4
but
it
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
will
purchase
again
dead
guy
should
be
a
staple
in
everyones
beer
diet
its
got
a
full
rich
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
its
light
to
medium
bodied
and
quite
drinkble
to
me
this
tastes
like
everything
bass
ale
aspires
to
be
the
tastes
are
comparable
but
dead
guy
gets
it
right
there
is
nothing
too
complex
about
this
beer
and
thats
a
good
thing
it
is
a
testament
to
the
fact
that
your
tastebuds
dont
always
need
to
be
assaulted
with
a
billion
different
flavors
to
be
an
interesting
beer
the
beauty
of
dead
guy
is
its
simplicity
its
also
great
with
just
about
any
food
you
can
think
of
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
thick
head
which
lasts
longer
that
i
expected
smells
very
nice
light
caramelcandy
smell
tastes
very
nice
a
bit
sweet
and
goes
does
very
easily
amberhoney
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
nice
lacing
smells
sweet
candy
and
hops
starts
sweet
medium
body
with
noticeable
hop
bite
strange
for
the
style
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
a
surprise
this
was
set
up
at
purchase
in
a
halloween
display
a
nice
looking
copperamber
brew
with
a
medium
white
sticky
head
that
laced
well
a
good
balance
of
more
malt
than
hop
with
a
slight
fruity
sweet
taste
the
aroma
backs
up
the
taste
well
i
will
seek
this
again
as
a
great
autumn
ale
for
its
name
available
yearround
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
is
sticky
head
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
both
present
themselves
in
every
aspect
of
the
beer
from
the
first
sniff
through
the
finish
aroma
shows
a
more
floral
hoppiness
as
it
warms
likewise
sweet
molases
flavors
appear
as
you
work
on
the
beer
it
has
a
rough
hardedged
quality
with
the
flavors
banging
against
one
another
very
good
i
hope
it
becomes
a
regular
item
in
my
local
beer
store
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
light
head
and
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
and
a
definite
hop
presence
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
strong
yet
pleasant
hop
bitterness
especially
the
aftertaste
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
quite
refreshing
a
decent
buy
at
3
49
for
a
22oz
bottle
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
its
goldenamber
with
a
sticky
white
head
its
got
the
unmistakeable
bock
smell
of
sweet
malt
but
with
more
hops
than
the
typical
bock
it
has
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
up
front
with
traces
of
ripe
fruit
and
enough
hop
bite
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
its
highly
drinkable
and
just
made
for
that
old
saying
through
the
teeth
and
over
the
gums
look
out
stomach
here
it
comes
a
winner
hoisted
this
to
celebrate
halloween
the
night
the
dead
guys
roam
another
winner
from
rogue
malty
almost
syrupy
and
full
of
ripe
fruit
flavors
no
idea
how
old
this
bottle
was
there
was
a
good
bit
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
it
did
not
decant
and
whatever
the
beers
age
it
had
aged
quite
gracefully
the
only
negative
was
that
i
did
not
have
a
bottle
with
the
glow
in
the
dark
label
ive
heard
about
well
theres
always
next
year

the
carbonation
is
quite
lively

its
difficult
to
perceive
due
to
the
beers
cloudy

rich
caramel
malt
aroma
with
a
fruity
quality
that
is

like
dried

taste
begins
with
toasted
malts
and
a
slight
sting
of
carbonation
towards
the
middle
of
the
taste
the
hops
assert
themselves
fairly
forcefully
towards
the
finish
caramel
flavors
play
off
against
the
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
range
of
the
beer
improved
dramatically
as
it
warmed

of
mine

frothy
tan

the
most
part

is
of
sweet

at
first
with
some
of
the
trademark

smooth

21st
october
2002
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
supersmooth
nice
hazy
orangeamber
body
with
a
decent
head
in
a
pint
glass
the
head
leaves
a
faint
lace
moderate
aroma
that
is
not
overpowering
very
enticing
floral
hops
are
noticable
as
well
a
slight
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
clean
and
much
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
very
well
balanced
with
a
good
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
the
beer
drinks
very
easy
especially
for
a
moderate
abv
this
was
my
first
rogue
tasting
and
it
will
not
be
my
last
rogues
dead
guy
ale
pours
honeyapple
cider
amber
with
a
delicate
white
head
some
retention
the
taste
this
beer
brings
to
the
table
is
awesome
this
is
a
brilliant
use
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
to
create
a
tropical
fruit
caramel
toasty
malt
spicy
hops
combination
of
flavors
the
creamy
mouthfeel
was
welcomed
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
outstanding
this
is
a
must
try
and
something
that
could
easily
become
a
standard
beer
in
your
refrigerator
obviously
id
recommend
it
this
ale
very
good
it
pours
with
a
fairly
thick
head
which
leaves
a
light
lace
it
has
a
thickly
hoppy
smell
and
a
taste
that
is
slightly
more
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
just
okay
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
i
dig
this
brew
and
will
probably
geti
t
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
honey
color
with
with
a
nice
white
head
which
leaves
generous
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
malty
aroma
with
fruity
and
floral
hints
starts
off
with
some
sweetness
a
bit
of
honey
and
grainbread
flavors
then
comes
the
hops
to
balance
it
nicely
smooth
and
medium

drink
flavorful
and
enjoyable
hazy
orange
tinted
copper
color
slight
sticky
offwhite
head
dissipates
to
a
rimming
in
seconds
carmally
malty
aroma
you
can
tell
this
helles
bock
uses
an
ale
yeast
some
fruity
tones
not
present
in
most
maibocks
are
here
and
there
isnt
as
clean
of
a
malt
profile
as
most
maibocks
that
said
this
is
a
tasty
brew
tastes
more
like
an
american
style
amber
ale
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
munich
malt
twist
to
it
solid
maltiness
and
solid
hop
characteristics
of
course
has
a
spicy
little
noble
hop
kick
almost
full
in
body
and
almost
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
not
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
even
if
its
not
necessarily
a
true
maibock
this
pours
with
lasting
tan
head
over
mediumamber
liquid
with
a
gentle
carbonation
a
beautiful
maltybready
aroma
meets
the
nose
taste
is
sweetness
with
depth
a
bit
of
honeyish
notes
followed
by
a
subtle
but
effective
hop
bitterness
this
finishes
smooth
and
clean
with
some
latent
hoppiness
to
close
things
out
another
in
a
long
line
of
winners
from
one
of
americas
premier
micros
amber
haze
with
a
white
sticky
head
that
mostly
settles
soon
after
the
pour
great
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
in
the
nose
just
a
bit
fruity
and
peatlike
with
a
taste
i
literally
become
wideeyed
what
is
this
im
tasting
could
it
be
pistachio
right
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
a
very
clear
pistachiolike
character
something
ive
never
experienced
in
a
beer
before
before
i
start
ranting
about
loving
pistachios
id
better
move
on
to
the
other
characteristics
sweetness
from
the
malt
balanced
well
by
the
hops
as
in
the
nose
breadlike
toasted
malt
character
abound
especially
with
retroolfaction
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
both
crisp
from
the
hops
and
grainy
from
the
malt
im
really
enjoying
the
unique
character
of
this
beer
very
flavorful
and
just
plain
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
slightly
hazy
reddishorange
in
color
with
a
fluffy
ivory
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
light
lace
the
aroma
is
mainly
malty
with
a
softly
toasty
caramel
note
and
a
lightly
spicy
hoppiness
as
well
as
some
dark
fruitiness
at
times
i
thought
of
cherry
the
body
is
medium
with
a
somewhat
less
than
moderate
carbonation
level
very
english
giving
a
nice
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
richly
malty
with
a
solid
caramel
notes
and
some
distinct
piney
hops
its
well
balanced
giving
a
seesaw
effect
that
goes
from
sweet
malt
to
hop
flavor
bitterness
with
each
taste
the
finish
is
dryish
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
very
nicely
done
very
drinkable
with
alot
of
character
highly
recommended
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
because
the
friend
i
was
with
couldnt
stop
talking
about
how
good
it
was
i
found
it
good
not
great
the
color
was
orangeamber
but
was
cloudy
it
poured
nice
with
a
creamy
head
the
smell
was
both
sweet
and
hoppy
i
tasted
malt
honey
the
bitterness
was
was
what
i
was
not
expecting
drinkable
but
not
the
greatest
beer
healthy
tenacious
head
of
copper
and
cream
color
the
liquid
is
reddish
gold
the
color
is
so
vibrant
it
looks
like
a
light
source
of
its
own
a
nose
of
baklava
honey
phyllo
roasted
pistachios
dirty
laundry
and
guava
dense
and
tropical
silky
creamy
texture
that
reveals
delicate
shadings
of
melon
tropical
blooms
hops
strawberries
new
paint
i
cant
get
over
how
solid
it
feels
like
heavy
cream
and
how
bright
and
clean
it
is
on
the
palate
the
finish
lasts
and
lasts
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
easy
deep
hazy
amber
in
color
with
a
delicate
white
head
a
sweet
malty
aroma
hints
at
wood
and
honey
the
nose
is
sweet
and
opens
up
to
cinnamon
and
other
baking
spice
flavors
as
well
as
toffee
mouthfeel
is
very
rounded
and
soft
the
hops
provide
solid
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
dont
completely
cut
the
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
the
complex
malt
flavors
in
this
beer
hazy
amber
orange
with
very
little
head
sweet
aroma
from
malt
and
floral
fruity
hops
very
balanced
between
malt
and
hop
flavors
with
a
medium
body
mmm
tasty
a
quality
brew
from
a
quality
brewery
ill
say
that
this
is
the
least
beer
that
ive
tasted
from
rogue
i
thought
it
was
to
bitter
after
the
first
taste
i
couldnt
pick
up
the
flavor
of
this
brew
i
might
try
again
later
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
second
time
around
i
found
it
pleasant
with
a
malt
hoppy
and
caramel
flavor
the
bitterness
was
not
over
powering
and
was
a
pleasant
surprise
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
thick
offwhite
head
that
lasts
until
the
last
drop
the
smell
was
light
malt
with
a
slightly
nutty
smell
but
the
smell
was
light
overall
the
very
sweet
malt
flavor
and
slightly
bitterdry
finish
was
nice
the
flavor
was
longlasting
but
the
beer
was
not
active
enough
to
warrant
more
than
a
3
5
for
mouthfeel
i
would
call
it
an
above
average
beer
but
not
great
flavourful
malts
and
balancing
hops
but
too
light
for
me
worth
a
try
however
cheers
goldorange
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
pleasing
malty
nose
nuts
and
sweet
flavors
in
the
mouth
with
a
good
touch
of
bitterness
very
well
balanced
almost
to
the
point
of
perfection
the
dead
guy
has
been
sitting
on
my
shelf
for
about
a
month
and
i
finally
got
around
to
him
last
night
wow
what
a
good
beer
deep
burnt
orange
to
amber
in
color
the
head
was
very
full
fluffy
and
thick
with
a
light
tan
color
noticable
hop
aroama
bubbles
bust
through
slightly
sweet
floral
and
honey
smells
with
a
big
burst
of
malt
taste
is
unbelievably
balanced
with
supersweet
malty
richness
and
a
crisp
dry
hopped
finish
tastes
alot
like
the
best
amber
ale
i
have
ever
had
that
rich
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
listed
as
a
maibock
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
a
great
beer
smooth
and
creamy
richness
suspect
a
higher
abv
warms
your
belly
another
pleasant
surprise
from
rogue
this
is
another
beer
that
made
the
crosscountry
trip
from
california
and
well
worth
it
the
dead
guy
was
a
good
guy
what
a
great
almost
perfect
balance
of
malts
and
hops
both
are
so
equally
represented
in
this
brew
slight
tartness
and
bitterness
towards
the
end
nice
hoppy
flavor
characteristic
of
rogue
chewy
caramel
maltiness
makes
this
very
interesting
especially
for
the
style
subtle
alcohol
as
well
sooo
much
better
on
draught
too
same
flavor
but
a
bit
creamier
with
more
body
a
session
brew
if
ever
there
was
one
very
malty
candy
nose
with
a
hazy
dark
orange
look
the
head
is
very
pale
and
lasting
with
a
good
lace
on
the
glass
wonderful
taste
of
slight
nut
and
sweetness
followed
by
distinct
bite
layers
of
flavor
that
bitterness
gives
great
balence
to
the
brews
sweetness
great
smooth
body
through
to
the
finish
quite
a
complex
ale
there
is
alot
going
on
here
and
i
like
it
isnt
it
ironic
the
dead
guy
makes
me
feel
very
much
alive
i
will
admit
that
i
tried
this
beer
because
of
the
name
i
work
in
a
liquor
store
and
i
could
not
pass
on
the
dead
guy
lets
just
say
i
was
pleased
with
this
beverage
it
was
a
dark
and
smooth
ale
that
had
a
little
kick
for
ya
i
look
forward
to
sampling
other
beers
produced
by
rogue
brewing
malts
provide
a
nice
backbone
whilte
there
are
some
nice
spicy
notes
a
tad
different
than
other
maibocks
but
very
drinkable
dead
guy
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
tan
head
nice
aroma
to
it
some
sweetness
to
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
tanginess
the
title
and
label
may
be
a
way
to
get
some
of
my
punk
rock
buddies
to
switch
from
drinking
rolling
rock
i
have
to
admit
im
a
bit
confused
by
the
style
is
it
really
a
maibock
if
so
why
do
they
call
it
an
ale
keep
these
questions
in
mind
as
you
consider
this
review
first
off
its
got
a
great
look
honey
to
almostamber
hue
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
confusing
to
me
though
with
aromas
of
honey
and
tropical
fruit
but
imo
too
much
hop
fragrance
for
a
maibock
same
with
the
taste
a
nice
malty
sweetness
hits
your
tongue
but
gives
way
to
a
rather
bitter
typical
rogue
hop
finish
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
hops
as
much
as
the
next
guy
and
maybe
even
more
than
some
but
i
didnt
think
they
really
fit
here
nice
medium
dark
appearance
thin
head
might
be
nicer
if
served
from
draught
sweet
malty
bouquet
with
hints
of
fruit
and
flower
rich
and
full
flavored
with
good
malt
character
nice
finish
of
sweet
floral
notes
delicious
to
say
the
least
an
all
around
prize
ale
brewed
here
crafted
very
well
great
use
of
hops
and
malt
to
come
up
with
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
quaffers
delight
love
the
label
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviews
and
saying
that
its
not
a
beer
that
knock
you
off
your
feet
but
a
good
drinking
beer
pours
a
nice
yellowish
pale
amber
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
foamy
head
light
earthy
hops
with
a
strong
malt
presence
in
the
aroma
strong
malt
body
with
light
hops
that
balance
this
brew
out
very
well
creamy
across
the
palate
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
this
isnt
a
knock
you
off
your
feet
brew
but
definitely
a
very
tasty
brew
a
great
brew
for
a
night
of
laid
back
drinking
id
agree
with
one
of
the
other
reviews
in
that
this
isnt
a
knockmedown
great
beer
but
its
straight
up
solid
allaround
good
beer
lightly
airy
and
medium
in
the
mouth
quite
drinkable
but
not
terribly
interesting
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
prefer
a
traditional
maibock
this
seems
like
a
trainingwheels
version
for
the
american
consumer
dead
guy
ale
starts
with
light
malt
aromas
and
notes
of
hops
the
color
is
a
golden
amber
color
topped
by
a
tightly
bubbled
tan
fluffy
head
on
the
palate
it
is
very
flavorful
with
an
initial
surge
of
honey
sweetness
and
then
notes
of
grapefruit
tartness
followed
by
a
very
nice
bitter
finish
yet
another
excellent
brew
from
rogue
hazy
amber
not
highly
carbed
relatively
fullbodied
extremely
well
balanced
malt
has
a
creamy
quality
not
a
blast
of
taste
but
nice
mouthfeel
and
full
finish
deerinkable
nice
if
allowed
to
warm
me
like
52
this
is
a
maibock
not
an
ale
has
a
cloudy
orange
apearance
and
a
saaz
hop
aroma
wonderfully
balanced
and
is
delicious
warm
alcohol
finish
to
boot
this
is
one
helluva
maibock
slides
down
so
smooth
its
scary
dead
guy
ale
what
a
name
it
has
both
a
strong
malty
caramel
tendency
and
a
bitter
hops
taste
so
id
say
its
very
well
rounded
there
are
also
some
slight
earthy
fruity
flavors
invading
the
palate
here
extremely
tastey
brew
a
fairly
potent
whif
of
malty
caramel
on
the
nose
a
superb
beer
i
like
a
hoppy
beer
but
i
found
this
a
bit
unbalanced
has
a
great
head
and
smell
goes
great
with
spaghetti
wonderful
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
miss
from
the
northwest
just
a
very
drinkable
beer
find
it
drink
it
love
it
and
may
the
dead
guy
be
with
you
great
for
october
a
highend
ale
a
great
allaround
beer
nice
hop
flavor
and
well
balanced
very
good
strong
ale
malty
sweetness
is
balanced
with
assertive
hopping
another
fine
rogue
brew
technically
labeled
a
bock
this
one
tastes
more
like
the
classic
english
strong
ales
imho
nevertheless
a
favorite
i
love
this
beer
great
maltyness
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
im
on
a
steady
diet
of
dead
guy
made
right
in
my
own
back
yard
and
it
is
super
superb
when
really
fresh
fairly
hazy
peachy
copper
with
a
foamy
cream
head
aroma
is
herbal
and
sweet
with
caramel
malt
dominating
and
a
surprisingly
strong
whiskey
and
vanilla
character
flavor
is
also
sweet
and
malty
with
said
whiskey
and
vanilla
adding
complexity
and
a
lightly
bitter
oaky
toasted
finish
theres
a
bit
of
a
tangy
character
thats
slightly
offputting
not
sure
if
its
barrelderived
but
that
wouldnt
surprise
me
still
retains
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
o
decent
beer
but
i
wish
the
oak
was
more
pronounced
overall
not
much
difference
from
double
dead
guy
here
maybe
i
should
try
them
sidebyside
but
eh
well
still
tasty
overall

excellent
beer
reminds
me
of
innis
and
gunn
in
the
old
days
before
demand
forced
them
to
change
how
they
aged
their
beers
however
ig
never
featured
taste
collages
like
these
excellent
balance
on
almost
every
level
and
just
an
allaround
fantastic
beer
recommended
ive
had
a
few
other
rogue
brews
and
while
im
not
an
avid
fan
they
do
make
a
few
decent
beers
old
crustacean
but
this
oneoh
man
if
i
could
get
a
refund
i
would
be
all
over
that
o
for
the
style
its
pretty
flavorful
was
a
bit
dissapointed
in
the
lack
if
whiskey
character
but
overall
nice
and
malty
with
an
oak
kick
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
oak
flavors
but
the
sweetness
really
grows
too
sweet
and
the
bitterness
that
tries
to
balance
it
is
too
harsh
and
abrasive
there
is
balance
but
both
of
the
dominate
flavors
are
too
over
the
top
to
really
enjoy
oa
decent
barrelaged
ale
flavors
work
pretty
well
together
lovely
beer
and
worth
the
money
for
one
who
wants
to
try
something
once
having
it
with
some
nice
bleu
davergne
which
works
wonders
i
drank
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
just
under
room
temperature
while
the
second
half
chilled
in
the
freezer
the
first
half
was
wonderful
the
whiskey
notes
were
prominent
but
not
overwhelming
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
but
there
is
a
mellow
sweetness
that
follows
the
initial
whiskey
flavor
the
second
half
tasted
like
a
slightly
hoppy
blue
moon
i
regretted
letting
it
chill
really
interesting
aroma
misleadingly
herbal
overall
good
beer
i
prefer
it
to
regular
dead
guy
o
a
rich
and
complex
ale
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
despite
having
no
particular
fondness
for
whiskey
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
adds
a
good
level
of
wood
and
whiskey
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
probably
contributes
to
the
fine
mouthfeel
improved
with
warming
rogue
john
john
dead
guy
ale
45
o
very
interesting
take
on
a
hells
bock
dead
guy
is
a
phenomenal
ale
this
really
highlights
it
on
a
slight
bourbon
barrel
feel
they
really
did
well
with
timing
on
the
aging
of
this
beer
on
the
wood
if
anything
longer
this
would
of
been
a
mess
good
beer
poured
at
a
good
temperature
wilth
a
decent
size
light
tan
foamy
frothy
head
that
soon
settled
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
the
best
part
here
and
is
malt
whiskey
hop
and
aromatic
flavor
doesnt
have
mujch
of
the
whiskey
but
lots
of
malt
and
some
hop
comes
through
its
also
fairly
dry
with
carbonic
tang
balanced
nicely
with
the
bitter
and
the
slight
sweet
to
take
the
edge
off
body
is
also
excellent
and
is
soft
but
not
overly
and
great
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
good
burps
a
little
boozy
the
whiskey
flavor
finally
comes
through
and
a
bit
on
the
long
side
o
decent
barrel
aged
ale
that
i
would
really
like
to
try
on
draft
overall
unfortunately
there
are
no
dates
on
this
but
this
bottle
isnt
more
than
6
months
out
from
being
sold
mild
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
the
barrels
are
boring
at
best
i
guess
they
decided
to
just
put
an
unimpressive
beer
into
unimpressive
barrels
the
feel
sucks
as
well
this
is
a
boring
beer
id
hope
theyd
forget
about
making
again
ive
had
better
from
rogue
thanks
again
for
the
beers
dad
always
appreciate
you
thinking
of
me
while
youre
lapping
up
the
sun
o
this
whiskeybarrel
flavor
is
very
subtle
i
really
like
the
beer
because
dead
guy
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
and
will
still
get
this
beer
on
occasionally
in
the
future
but
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
the
barrel
flavor
this
is
an
already
decent
beer
that
has
been
barrel
aged
to
add
some
subtle
complexity
not
at
all
overpowering
in
the
whiskey
department
very
nice
this
was
ok
but
overall
the
base
dead
guy
just
doesnt
seem
burly
enough
to
hold
up
to
the
strength
of
the
barrel
at
times
with
a
lot
of
oak
vanilla
and
burnt
character
really
starting
to
emerge
as
this
warmed
up
this
wasnt
bad
to
me
or
anything
but
just
seemed
like
it
needed
a
little
more
balance
between
the
base
and
barrel
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin
lie
of
bubbles
on
top
sweet
honey
and
caramel
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
fruity
esters
sweet
caramel
malt
and
fruity
esters
mix
with
a
vanilla
and
oak
flavor
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
balance
it
out
medium
body
and
the
feel
is
peppery
from
the
carbonation
with
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
they
had
the
barrel
thing
down
but
used
too
low
of
an
abv
beer
that
wasnt
even
too
complex
to
begin
with
now
if
they
aged
double
mocha
porter
like
this
is
would
be
world
class
worth
picking
up
for
5
bucks
i
guess
bottle
poured
a
dark
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
whisky
notes
are
quite
dominant
with
some
light
caramel
malt
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
the
caramelized
sugars
from
the
malt
backbone
with
some
nice
whisky
notes
that
are
not
too
boozy
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
very
nice
nonetheless
o
if
you
want
a
beer
that
is
going
to
slam
you
with
whiskey
this
is
not
your
beer
the
oak
and
whiskey
are
light
and
subtle
but
present
enough
that
you
certainly
notice
them
very
solid
beer
and
barrelaging
job
here
by
rogue
a
solid
beer
that
has
grains
of
barrel
aging
and
pulls
it
off
outrageously
overpriced
so
this
is
a
one
and
done
on
tap
pint
glass
enjoyed
on
may12
bright
orange
color
offwhite
creamy
lasting
crown
floral
hop
moderate
caramel
malt
yeasty
with
apple
touch
maltiness
dominates
flavors
eventhough
they
are
well
rounded
by
low
bitterness
ripe
fruit
apricot
peach
hints
whiskey
malt
notes
in
the
middle
slightly
woodcask
too
give
a
very
kind
warm
touch
to
such
an
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
soft
carbonation
subtle
astringency
dont
like
helles
bock
style
try
this
refreshing
flavorful
after
just
having
a
deadguy
ale
this
is
an
interesting
counterpoint
it
is
clearly
a
similar
beer
but
is
also
smoother
more
rounded
dynamic
and
interesting
the
appearance
has
the
same
amber
hue
and
white
head
the
smell
though
has
a
rounded
complexity
wood
sweetness
brandylike
vinous
scents
and
some
smokey
notes
the
taste
is
also
smoother
and
more
blended
sweet
but
very
drinkable
full
in
body
great
o
would
be
great
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
a
regular
dead
guy
but
we
love
it
just
fine
on
its
own
another
great
rogue
offering
o
having
tried
dead
guy
and
double
dead
guy
i
can
now
say
this
is
my
favorite
member
of
the
deaths
family
tree
i
havent
tried
many
barrel
aged
beers
but
i
can
confidently
say
it
works
wonders
on
this
classic
brew
get
some
interesting
somewhat
complex
beer
but
very
approachable
a
nice
spin
on
an
already
solid
beer
o
8
for
a
bottle
which
i
was
happy
to
buy
and
share
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
as
drinking
a
whole
bottle
might
be
too
much
the
whiskey
isnt
there
enough
and
the
base
beer
isnt
strong
enough
to
carry
it
through
o
a
very
good
brew
very
well
rounded
and
gives
a
very
nice
whisky
and
barrel
profile
a
mucho
quaffable
whisky
barrel
brew
how
disappointing
and
i
hate
giving
this
beer
such
poor
ratings
however
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
as
i
think
i
simply
just
got
a
bad
bottle
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
red
color
with
a
small
white
to
no
head
in
the
aroma
a
nice
abrasive
hop
and
a
caramel
like
malt
in
the
taste
an
abrasive
pine
hop
and
backed
up
with
a
caramel
like
malt
underneath
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
caramel
and
note
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
no
nose
really
eh
whatevs
overall
this
is
great
beer
and
the
whiskeybarrel
aging
has
given
the
normally
hoppy
dead
guy
ale
a
nice
earthy
oak
texture
it
does
somewhat
detract
from
the
hop
profile
however
and
in
my
opinion
the
brew
becomes
a
little
to
overpowering
in
the
whiskey
area
as
it
sits
on
the
tongue
and
melds
into
the
aftertaste
i
also
wanted
for
a
stronger
sugar
base
feeling
that
the
malty
notes
could
have
been
stronger
to
better
combat
the
whiskey
flavors
and
give
the
beer
more
punch
still
this
is
a
good
bottle
and
worth
trying
review
from
62011
notes
two
year
old
refrigerated
bottle
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
amber
one
finger
white
dissipating
head
leaving
a
ring
little
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
vanilla
light
whiskey
starts
with
caramel
and
transitions
into
whiskey
wood
and
vanilla
whiskey
vanilla
coconut
finish
hint
of
hops
this
is
a
two
year
old
refrigerated
bottle
i
think
the
hops
have
faded
the
the
balance
is
still
well
balanced
and
tasty
o
a
decent
beer
but
ultimately
a
letdown
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
and
not
as
good
as
dead
guy
i
dont
think
and
especially
not
double
dead
guy
overpriced
though
it
is
the
worst
part
wheres
the
whisky
barrel
taste
thats
part
of
what
sold
me
on
this
to
begin
with
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
it
had
a
rather
odd
flavor
profile
in
my
opinion
kind
of
random
but
nothing
was
really
all
that
off
although
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
beer
on
frequent
occasion
it
is
worth
a
try
do
if
a
beer
is
to
be
flawed
then
it
would
do
well
to
do
so
in
flamboyant
and
memorable
fashion
this
beer
is
able
to
pull
that
off
at
least
defying
categorization
and
being
simultaneously
hard
to
really
like
but
impossible
to
walk
away
from
a
very
unique
beer
experience
a
strange
beer
it
really
makes
me
think
that
rogues
whiskey
must
be
strange
as
well
overall
an
unusual
take
on
a
maibock
flavorful
and
interesting
o
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
lots
of
different
flavors
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
barrel
aged
ales
because
the
alcohol
is
usually
more
potent
but
it
was
hid
very
well
in
this
beer
however
i
do
wish
there
was
more
of
a
crisp
feeling
from
the
carbonation
its
the
only
thing
in
this
beer
that
seemed
rather
plain
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
golden
orange
pour
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
nothing
really
stands
out
body
is
medium
good
carbonation
slight
alcohol
nothing
really
stands
out
like
the
idea
of
aging
a
maibock
in
barrels
didnt
work
not
sure
if
it
needed
more
or
less
time
in
the
barrel
m
creamy
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
itd
be
also
a
little
hot
from
the
booze
o
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
makes
the
aroma
and
flavors
slightly
more
interesting
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
o
better
than
i
expected
and
not
as
much
alcohol
warming
as
some
beers
that
have
been
stored
in
spirits
barrels
you
can
easily
detect
the
taste
from
the
whiskey
barrels
this
beer
would
warm
you
nicely
if
you
were
drinking
it
on
a
cool
spring
day
o
i
got
it
on
draft
for
3
and
was
not
impressed
im
a
big
fan
of
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
one
didnt
gain
many
interesting
characteristics
from
the
barrels
it
was
stored
in
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
i
bought
this
brew
for
a
day
off
and
something
new
pours
as
almost
a
summer
beer
gold
with
a
hint
of
copper
pour
when
you
popped
the
top
the
smell
was
immediately
noticeable
the
gin
barrel
aging
is
great
you
get
all
the
flavor
of
gin
without
the
necessary
lime
and
tonic
mess
sorry
im
a
beer
guy
a
great
beer
i
just
wish
i
didnt
have
to
pay
5
99
for
22
oz
of
the
stuff
still
i
would
recommend
to
a
gt
lover
that
occasionally
drinks
beer
it
might
turn
them
to
the
lighter
side
of
drinking
opinion
i
dont
know
this
beer
misses
the
mark
for
me
on
a
number
of
levels
i
think
that
it
starts
out
by
calling
the
dead
guy
a
maibock
as
it
is
a
really
hopped
up
version
of
that
beer
if
you
can
even
call
it
one
that
said
now
you
mix
this
with
some
bold
barrel
flavors
that
dont
really
seem
intended
to
be
there
so
the
whole
thing
falls
apart
if
barrel
aged
beers
are
your
thing
which
i
really
enjoy
them
myself
this
may
be
a
good
one
to
try
so
that
you
can
get
another
review
otherwise
i
doubt
that
aging
this
beer
will
bring
it
together
so
i
would
steer
clear
if
i
were
you
o
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
this
is
what
you
get
when
barrel
aging
doesnt
work
the
barrel
added
nothing
to
this
instead
it
hurt
it
dont
bother
with
this
if
you
see
it
save
your
money
and
buy
something
good
drinkability
the
hops
come
across
a
little
tangental
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
maybe
a
fruitier
variety
or
just
less
of
them
would
have
made
a
more
concise
flavor
profile
but
i
like
the
beer
apart
from
that
o
this
is
an
extremely
nice
barrelaged
ale
that
does
not
lose
the
character
of
the
regular
dead
guy
ale
as
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
i
cannot
help
but
view
this
as
a
richer
more
complex
version
of
it
very
well
done
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
nothing
like
ive
ever
had
i
guess
i
am
still
drinking
it
and
enjoying
it
so
ill
call
good
even
though
at
first
it
seems
real
unexpected
wish
there
was
a
bigger
malt
backbone
on
this
but
there
ya
have
it
this
is
a
strong
beer
and
must
be
quaffed
with
respect
i
enjoyed
it
this
twist
of
dead
guy
ale
aged
in
dead
guy
whiskey
barrels
is
an
amazing
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
tiny
white
head
smells
of
light
vanilla
the
classic
dead
guy
ale
taste
has
completely
changed
its
there
but
with
a
smoother
oaky
sweet
vanilla
whiskey
flavor
ending
with
a
slight
bitterness
comparable
to
the
original
ale
im
a
big
fan
of
the
classic
dead
guy
ale
but
id
choose
this
over
that
any
day
i
love
the
complexity
pours
a
cloudy
orangishamber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
somewhat
tart
with
some
sweet
whiskey
hints
of
vanilla
and
almond
caramel
taste
is
surprisingly
tart
wasnt
expecting
this
but
really
like
it
tart
oak
flavors
blended
with
whiskey
and
vanilla
more
oak
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
tart
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
im
pretty
positive
this
beer
isnt
meant
to
be
tart
or
sour
so
its
probably
infected
however
i
absolutely
love
it
awesome
tasting
beer
thebeeralmanac
com
pours
a
hazy
pumpkin
orange
with
a
decent
head
aroma
has
a
lot
of
vanilla
notes
with
some
caramel
chew
and
oak
smell
initial
taste
is
uber
tangy
and
tart
body
has
a
lot
of
vanilla
flavoring
but
doesnt
last
too
long
finish
is
typical
dead
guy
ale
but
has
a
tartness
that
lasts
awhile
overall
i
really
liked
this
ale
and
thumbs
up
to
the
rogue
guys
for
always
pushing
the
envelope
d
dead
guy
was
one
of
my
gateway
beers
that
brought
me
from
the
world
of
bmc
over
to
this
planet
along
with
sam
adams
and
shiner
bock
im
happy
to
have
this
one
with
such
pronounced
whiskey
barrel
character
and
i
believe
as
im
sure
john
and
john
do
that
dead
was
the
perfect
guy
for
the
job
this
is
a
good
one
to
swirl
and
sniff
before
a
sip
because
the
aroma
is
that
nice
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
i
can
live
with
that
nothing
about
this
beer
really
fits
the
maibock
category
for
me
but
im
not
judging
it
on
style
guidelines
just
on
the
beer
itself
o
very
good
id
have
again
recommended
o
i
love
the
concept
and
i
like
the
beer
recommended
drinkable
interesting
and
compelling
would
have
again
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
brew
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
light
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
there
was
a
noticable
amount
of
barrel
aromas
in
there
along
with
the
malts
and
some
faint
hops
in
the
distance
the
taste
was
really
good
on
the
first
sip
there
was
a
good
amount
of
barrel
aged
flavors
but
as
i
drank
more
it
seems
to
fade
away
the
beer
starts
to
taste
like
a
normal
dead
guy
ale
to
me
by
mid
glass
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
again
a
little
on
the
thin
side
which
bugs
the
hell
out
of
me
overall
ive
had
much
better
barrel
aged
beers
in
the
passed
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
d
drinkable
but
not
blown
away
id
much
rather
enjoy
a
regular
dead
guy
for
half
the
price
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
golden
orange
with
an
aggrasive
pour
it
forms
a
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
and
eventually
dissapears
the
smell
is
alcohol
whiskey
yeast
hops
oak
a
lot
of
smell
follows
in
the
taste
with
whiskey
caramel
hops
grass
and
a
slight
tast
that
reminds
me
a
little
of
coca
cola
in
the
back
mouthful
is
a
syrup
slick
that
lingers
around
with
pretty
low
carbonation
its
a
good
beer
that
i
think
hit
what
they
intended
to
do
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
pours
a
hazed
light
copper
little
to
no
head
and
minimal
lace
aroma
is
interesting
alittle
malt
sweetness
hint
of
whiskey
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
firm
maltyness
a
touch
of
rogue
pacman
yeast
which
imparts
a
light
tartness
then
the
rest
is
oaky
tannins
good
whiskey
flavor
wood
soft
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
mild
medium
to
light
bodied
and
carbonation
low
overall
i
like
how
this
relatively
simple
brew
picked
up
alot
of
barrel
notes
pretty
nice
o
definitly
drink
this
one
again
and
will
search
out
another
this
one
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
aged
and
was
rather
good
pp
price
point
this
is
actually
going
to
be
one
of
the
toughest
pp
ratings
i
have
ever
had
to
argue
with
myself
over
the
price
point
on
this
is
8
99
for
a
22oz
bomber
7580
of
myself
agrees
that
this
is
indeed
fair
but
the
other
remaining
portion
of
my
brain
says
that
this
should
have
been
kicked
up
an
additional
2
of
abv
its
roughly
a
6
5
and
should
be
closer
to
8
preferably
9
for
that
price
overall
a
nice
beer
however
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
as
its
refreshing
change
from
the
usual
ipas
i
drink
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
when
i
come
back
to
oregon
visiting
my
family
o
my
gut
says
that
this
bottle
may
have
been
sitting
for
too
long
because
im
pretty
disappointed
with
the
experience
too
much
diacetyl
whether
from
the
brewery
or
from
further
maturation
it
is
however
a
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
overall
this
is
a
great
slightly
woody
amber
fallweather
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
daynight
and
in
large
qualtities
i
must
have
had
3
or
4
20
oz
drafts
while
shooting
pool
worth
seeking
out
of
you
like
the
original
dead
guy
and
want
to
try
something
new
much
better
on
draft
than
from
a
fresh
bottle
as
i
have
sampled
both
o
this
beer
constantly
leaves
me
wishing
for
just
a
bit
more
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
have
a
little
more
panache
o
lost
the
dead
guy
taste
but
it
is
a
great
drinking
beer
taste
exceptional
at
first
you
get
the
flavor
of
a
dead
guy
the
back
finish
is
unbelievable
smoke
wood
whiskey
everything
it
promises
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
i
have
had
other
john
john
rogue
beers
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
this
will
join
the
shelf
in
my
garage
with
the
other
top
20s
i
will
gladly
pay
the
meager
6
50
asked
for
this
beer
again
and
again
a
truly
complex
beer
not
much
of
an
improvement
over
the
original
but
definitely
good
the
whiskey
aging
is
noticeable
and
good
the
price
makes
it
worth
a
try
especially
for
a
limited
release
definitely
better
than
regular
dead
guy
nothing
stellar
but
rather
enjoyable
doverall
this
was
a
nice
maibock
nothing
to
outstanding
but
flavorfull
and
refreshing
wouldnt
pay
5
75
again
for
it
but
would
pay
3
or
soo
o
a
good
brew
and
i
reccommend
it
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
helluva
head
on
this
one
an
inch
and
a
half
of
off
white
fluffiness
that
stays
around
pretty
much
the
whole
way
through
the
beer
nose
smells
of
oranges
maybe
a
tad
apple
and
just
slight
whiskey
notes
kind
of
disappointed
in
the
taste
although
it
is
good
i
wish
it
had
more
whiskey
in
the
flavors
oranges
malt
just
a
slight
bit
of
whiskey
whiskey
gets
more
prevalent
as
i
drink
more
nice
full
mouth
feel
i
did
like
this
beer
but
i
thought
a
bit
more
whiskey
on
the
pallet
wouldve
made
this
a
fantastic
beer
an
incredibly
slick
and
very
buttery
oaky
brew
did
i
enjoy
it
not
especially
was
it
memorable
oh
hell
yes
this
is
a
beer
that
will
stick
in
my
mind
for
a
very
long
time
and
thats
something
to
appreciate
overall
this
is
a
very
worthy
brew
it
beats
the
hell
outta
john
john
hazel
nut
if
you
like
dead
guy
as
i
do
then
youll
really
appreciate
this
beer
it
is
unique
and
still
great
two
of
my
favorite
qualities
final
thought
if
you
havent
had
this
you
need
to
try
it
i
dont
remember
trying
the
base
beer
for
this
one
so
i
cant
make
the
comparison
not
cheap
at
11
a
bottle
but
im
not
mad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
more
for
casual
drinking
not
a
big
fan
of
the
dead
guy
whiskey
waaaay
too
sweet
for
a
whiskey
still
fond
of
the
original
dead
guy
i
cant
honestly
say
that
the
barrelaging
no
matter
how
akin
it
was
when
connecting
the
dots
actually
enhanced
the
final
product
over
a
regular
bottle
of
dead
guy
ive
said
it
before
an
interesting
and
fundamentally
obvious
experiment
for
rogue
to
do
with
their
own
products
but
id
rather
spend
less
money
and
enjoy
the
original
version
far
more
if
given
the
option
o
i
enjoyed
it
but
again
its
fairly
onenote
its
a
well
designed
beer
but
just
one
note
this
is
the
second
of
the
johnjohn
series
and
both
have
been
underwhelming
in
that
regard
i
really
enjoy
this
one
better
than
the
rum
aged
one
i
had
but
i
dont
know
if
its
worth
the
cost
for
enjoyment
aroma
didnt
offer
up
anything
new
that
i
could
trace
there
are
some
great
flavors
in
there
but
you
have
to
work
past
the
overall
biting
feel
and
flavor
and
you
get
only
a
hint
of
it
in
the
finish
good
but
im
not
totally
convinced
its
worth
it
o
the
barrel
aging
is
a
subtle
compliment
to
the
brew
very
balanced
and
flavourful
a
nice
twist
on
an
already
solid
brew
o
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
offering
and
it
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
john
john
series
to
date
the
oaked
whiskey
flavours
are
complementary
to
the
earthy
hops
and
burnt
sugar
notes
of
the
traditional
dead
guy
ale
although
a
tad
pricey
10bomber
i
would
venture
out
to
grab
another
bottle
on
occasion
o
i
have
never
given
the
majority
of
a
beer
to
the
drain
at
a
bar
i
kept
trying
and
i
just
gave
up
after
about
6
of
the
16
oz
couldnt
do
it
take
this
for
what
you
will
but
i
will
never
forget
this
brew
in
the
beers
defense
this
was
the
first
time
ive
experienced
john
john
dead
guy
ale
so
i
can
say
ill
give
it
another
shot
but
not
anytime
soon
maybe
this
should
be
called
the
john
aka
the
shitter
interesting
beer
its
good
but
not
great
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
whiskey
barrel
novelty
wears
off
quickly
this
beer
pours
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
leaves
only
a
little
lacing
and
hardly
any
retention
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
notes
and
the
taste
follows
along
with
the
usual
rogue
signature
sour
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
slightly
overcarbonated
aftertaste
overall
worth
a
try
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
a
barrelaged
summer
ale
this
could
be
it
john
john
dead
guy
ale
is
refreshing
low
in
alcohol
and
tasty
an
enjoyable
whiskey
influenced
beer
the
subtleties
of
the
base
bock
overridden
by
the
barrel
thats
not
to
say
that
this
is
over
the
top
just
that
its
nicely
augmented
by
the
extra
flavours
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
continuing
dead
guy
ale
or
lager
argument
aside
its
a
good
representation
of
style
although
this
is
a
case
in
my
opinion
where
barrel
aging
does
not
really
improve
a
good
beer
this
is
version
is
still
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
overall
its
ok
i
think
i
would
rather
have
regular
dead
guy
worth
a
try
though
mouth
still
much
bourbon
hops
woodiness
makes
me
wanna
try
their
bourbon
spirits
some
vanilla
this
is
a
handsome
beer
i
never
was
a
fan
of
dead
guy
but
this
offering
wow
an
easy
drinker
40
ibu
danger
overall
very
complex
and
delicious
unique
and
enjoyable
although
not
necessarily
something
ill
buy
very
often
like
the
vanilla
and
malty
tones
d
i
split
the
bottle
and
was
glad
i
did
at
the
end
of
my
glass
pours
thin
with
an
orange
caramel
color
very
thin
light
head
liight
and
somewhat
citrusy
nose
similar
to
just
the
standard
dead
guy
taste
is
malt
which
is
quickly
dominated
by
bourbon
very
strong
but
not
unpleasant
bourbon
flavor
it
is
a
little
overwhelming
however
surprisingly
clean
finish
all
and
all
a
very
nice
helles
and
an
interesting
barrel
aged
beer
glad
i
got
to
give
it
a
try
medium
bodied
with
a
very
prominent
whiskey
barrel
flavor
that
overpowers
most
of
the
other
characteristics
and
lingers
into
a
slightly
hot
dry
finish
lots
of
whiskey
flavor
without
being
overly
hot
with
hints
of
toasted
earthy
oak
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
the
base
beer
is
overpowered
but
underneath
there
are
still
hints
of
pale
malt
caramel
toffee
and
biscuit
its
still
pretty
good
and
at
the
relatively
low
abv
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
it
could
stand
to
be
more
balanced
and
have
a
little
less
onedimensional
whiskey
barrel
flavor
d
4
overall
i
find
this
beer
quite
drinkable
it
has
something
about
it
that
keeps
me
lifting
my
glass
the
flavor
was
more
balanced
than
i
anticipated
from
the
smell
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
in
a
good
way
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
definitely
worth
trying
for
those
that
enjoy
the
original
dead
guy
its
a
nice
twist
d
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
it
really
was
not
anything
of
an
improvement
on
regular
dead
guy
that
being
said
if
the
price
was
lower
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
all
night
its
an
ok
beer
but
it
just
failed
to
impress
d
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
much
more
drinkable
than
even
the
flagship
dead
guy
like
a
slightly
sweet
cream
soda
of
beers
rather
flavorful
well
thought
out
and
made
started
strong
but
the
middle
kind
of
fell
out
disappointing
a
cool
beer
conceptually
it
definitely
wasnt
unpleasant
but
just
really
lacked
something
didnt
hold
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
an
easy
drinker
and
a
growler
to
the
head
in
one
night
shouldnt
be
a
problem
but
i
expected
a
little
more
not
really
worth
the
17
99
growler
fill
i
havent
had
the
original
dead
guy
in
quite
awhile
to
compare
so
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
certainly
will
pick
up
more
from
this
brewery
i
found
this
beer
quite
drinkable
i
believe
due
to
its
lightness
it
has
the
flavors
and
nose
without
the
palate
destroying
components
quite
drinkable
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
would
be
curious
to
see
what
it
was
like
out
of
the
tap
d
ok
but
not
great
the
taste
and
booze
didnt
keep
me
coming
back
it
doesnt
matter
what
yeast
was
used
its
an
american
beer
for
gods
sake
american
yeast
makes
sense
no
harm
in
that
while
one
may
criticize
the
manner
in
which
this
beer
does
not
fit
the
mold
of
a
maibock
i
dont
give
that
one
thought
it
fits
the
mold
of
a
tasty
beer
how
can
a
maibock
or
hellesbock
be
fermented
with
the
standard
traditional
pacman
yeast
i
know
this
is
their
standard
yeast
but
you
cant
brew
world
class
offerings
from
other
styles
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
an
american
yeast
for
this
reason
this
beer
is
complete
garbage
and
cant
even
be
reviewed
in
the
category
its
classified
it
makes
no
sense
it
lacks
the
complexity
that
any
hellesbock
should
have
by
what
is
imparted
throught
he
yeast
and
just
ends
up
being
a
bland
malty
slightly
sweet
offering
with
back
notes
of
straw
complete
garbage
for
the
style
a
decent
matly
beer
if
you
have
no
other
choices
not
recommended
against
the
style
and
certainly
not
for
the
price
this
is
a
problem
for
rogue
with
more
than
just
this
beer
bought
a
bottle
of
this
at
boonton
liquor
outlet
in
boonton
nj
into
a
tulip
it
poured
goldenorange
with
a
high
degree
of
carbonation
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
and
great
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
revealed
citrus
honey
caramel
oak
cherry
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
a
beautiful
blend
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
at
first
then
dissolving
to
a
more
pronounced
malty
cherryvanilla
flavor
on
the
finish
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
dry
warmth
afterwards
which
further
reinforced
the
mental
association
with
whiskey
with
the
great
head
retention
it
felt
creamy
smooth
as
less
carbonation
was
evident
in
the
feel
than
in
the
appearance
medium
thickness
awesome
sessioning
beer
with
the
standout
feature
being
the
balance
i
respectfully
disagree
with
some
of
the
earlier
reviews
that
claim
that
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
nose
or
that
whiskey
dominates
i
truly
believe
that
this
beer
has
an
excellently
blended
flavor
profile
resulting
from
the
barrel
aging
if
i
may
make
the
analogy
it
tasted
like
a
nugget
nectar
which
further
morphed
into
cherry
vanilla
goodness
if
that
makes
any
sense
to
you
oh
and
by
the
way
in
my
humble
opinion
of
the
three
john
john
ales
that
rogue
has
released
and
i
have
tried
i
find
this
offering
to
be
by
far
their
most
complex
and
best

john

john

ill
still
take
rogues
regular
offerings
every
day
of
the
week
and
twice
on
sunday
i
dont
really
enjoy
whiskey
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
the
whiskey
isnt
overwhelming
its
warming
but
never
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
still
pretty
light
overall
i
enjoy
it
although
i
miss
dead

hop
presence
taste
follows
the
nose
moderately
malty
upfront
a
peek
of
fruitiness
and
then
a
dollop

close
everything
seems
to
flow
together
easily
mouthfeel
is

smooth
with

loving
this
one
and
best
carbonated

ive

in

long
time
john
john
ale
is
not
rogues
finest
moment
its
alright
but
seems
a
little
too
convoluted
to
work
well
the
nose
is
weak
the
hop
flavor
seems
too
bold
and
the
bodys
too
thin
all
in
all
its
merely
okay
rogue
has
released
far
better
beers
worth
a
try
eh
maybe
stick
to
a
single
bottle
if
youre
intrigued
ah
well
life
goes
on
and
beer
is
good
an
interesting
beer
perhaps
a
bit
simplistic
but
i
am
actually
enjoying
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
base
beer
is
definitely
thoroughly
dominated
by
the
barrel
character
but
i
like
that
such
a
light
beer
is
able
to
not
let
this
get
too
out
of
control
you
definitely
will
have
to
enjoy
whiskeybarrel
aged
beers
to
like
this
and
i
like
that
this
is
not
hot
and
that
the
whiskey
character
is
so
smooth
this
bottle
will
be
all
i
want
and
then
some
maybe
make
a
4
pack
of
this
in
12
oz
bottles
i
mean
if
you
like
it
12
oz
is
more
than
enough
if
you
dont
like
it
you
wont
even
consider
them
oh
wait
this
is
rogue
theyre
fine
with
their
beers
just
sitting
on
shelves
for
monthsyears
pours
a
robust
amber
with
a
sticky
head
the
aroma
is
slight
and
malty
the
flavor
is
heavy
and
aniselike
with
a
deep
chicory
malt
and
a
spicy
burn
on
the
finish
the
malt
spice
gives
it
a
lovely
bitterness
delicious
although
not
strictly
an
ocktoberfest
this
is
a
lovely
fall
beer
d
this
was
an
interesting
barrel
aged
ale
nonstout
but
not
the
most
delicious
the
scent
and
taste
were
enjoyable
but
not
great
and
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
with
a
clean
finish
and
low
abv
but
in
the
end
this
was
only
worth
trying
once
as
a
gimmick
o
solid
good
whiskeybeer
balance
great
spicejuniper
character
was
quite
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
on
a
recent
excursion
to
lawrence
pours
a
rather
vibrant
ruby
red
to
rust
ornage
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
large
billowing
head
thats
a
full
inch
high
the
nose
is
very
fruity
and
floral
though
there
is
some
woody
notes
likely
due
to
the
barrel
aging
the
hops
accentuate
the
floral
notes
this
beer
makes
my
mouth
water
light
mouthfeel
from
such
a
complex
beer
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
somewhat
syrupy
but
its
not
nearly
that
heavy
kind
of
disappointing
actually
the
first
thing
you
notice
about
the
beer
is
the
finish
up
front
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
nice
pale
ale
theres
some
fruity
hop
things
going
on
giving
way
to
malt
sweetness
but
the
finish
to
this
beer
is
almost
mind
blowing
theres
this
terrific
flowered
wood
finish
that
reminds
me
of
a
creek
in
spring
or
something
similar
i
dont
really
care
for
the
minor
alcohol
notes
most
likely
from
the
aging
process
but
thats
to
be
expected
given
this
style
of
beer
as
the
beer
opens
up
it
gives
you
a
lot
more
from
the
flavor
profile
the
hops
are
floral
i
get
lavendar
marigold
maybe
even
lillies
quite
lovely
these
accent
the
sweet
caramel
malt
finally
leading
into
that
wonderful
finish
its
a
very
circular
flavor
if
that
makes
sense
theres
not
a
lot
of
breadiness
or
biscuit
qualities
to
this
beer
its
very
light
on
the
palate
and
quite
delacte
this
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
at
all
but
its
enjoyable
and
delicious
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
end
of
another
day
in
a
neverending
hot
summer
atmosphere
is
excellent
a
deep
rich
appearance
lends
its
way
to
a
beautiful
creamy
towering
head
which
insulates
your
precious
brew
throughout
the
entire
experience
the
nose
is
just
loaded
the
only
possible
downside
almost
too
many
components
my
olfactory
senses
went
all
haywire
flavor
is
similar
in
output
to
the
nose
lots
of
stuff
going
on
here
but
nothing
is
going
to
overwhelm
and
offput
you
everything
seems
to
marry
together
well
in
the
end
this
is
a
great
quaff
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
an
interesting
blend
but
it
works

vanilla
the
taste
is
a
very
enjoyable
blend
of
crisp
caramel
malts
against
a
nice
oak
profile
that
leaves
an
intriguing
whiskeylike
finish
quite
tasty
the
beer
is
somewhat
light
with
a
decent
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
especially
since
dead
guy
ale
was
the
gateway
beer
to
craft
beer
for
me
and
remains
one
of
my
regular
favorites
very
spunky
stuff
unique
all
the
way
from
the
hops
to
the
yeast
and
aged
malty
flavors
d
interesting
the
barrel
aged
character
is
much
more
prevalent
in
the
flavor
than
it
is
in
the
aroma
though
there
is
a
definite
uptick
in
complexity
of
the
aroma
compared
to
regular
dead
guy
that
would
have
to
be
due
to
the
time
spent
in
the
barrel
the
woody
character
in
the
flavor
seems
a
little
thin
to
me
as
compared
to
what
i
am
used
to
from
most
barrel
aged
beers
this
may
be
because
the
average
barrel
aged
beer
consists
of
a
stronger
base
beer
or
it
may
be
due
to
the
characteristics
of
the
barrel
either
way
while
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
it
comes
off
a
little
flat
and
seems
to
need
something
more
to
make
it
really
pop
in
the
end
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
one
on
one
hand
it
is
lacking
and
weak
with
flavors
that
need
more
force
to
back
them
up
but
it
is
something
more
interesting
and
flavorful
than
the
base
beer
so
i
cant
quite
say
that
it
was
a
waste
of
a
barrel
i
dont
regret
the
opportunity
to
try
this
but
next
time
they
might
be
better
off
using
double
dead
guy
when
they
have
the
itch
to
put
something
in
a
barrel
was
pretty
excited
to
try
this
one
kind
of
a
letdown
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
aromas
of
whiskey
and
sweet
malt
flavors
of
sweet
malt
caramel
vanilla
and
some
charred
oak
not
nearly
as
impressive
as
id
hoped
leaves
me
somewhat
less
than
excited
to
try
the
others
in
this
series
pours
a
hazy
goldamber
hue
with
a
cream
white
head
decent
amount
of
carbonations
just
from
looking
at
all
them
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
nice
crisp
malty
aromas
with
some
hints
of
vanilla
added
in
there
probably
from
the
barrel
definitely
tastes
like
dead
guy
for
sure
burnt
malt
yet
very
clean
in
execution
again
notes
of
vanilla
flavor
that
seem
separate
from
other
flavors
there
are
also
some
woody
flavors
that
do
better
job
blending
with
the
original
beer
all
the
different
things
going
on
leaves
the
buds
guess
each
time
but
not
confusing
them
definitely
could
use
a
little
more
focus
or
could
it
huge
points
for
making
a
barrel
aged
beer
out
of
something
so
nonimperial
as
dead
guy
definitely
something
on
the
original
end
of
the
spectrum
somehow
the
beer
makes
sense
the
vanilla
does
compliment
the
wood
and
malt
notes
very
well
if
dead
guy
was
a
hamburger
putting
this
beer
in
a
whiskey
barrel
is
like
adding
cheese
and
bacon
to
the
burger
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
overly
rich
with
fruit
or
flavor
like
some
maibocks
very
enjoyable
interesting
beer
oakbourbon
was
too
apparent
and
the
beer
seemed
very
floral
md
moutuhfeel
is
light
and
creamy
in
terms
of
drinkability
dead
guy
just
isnt
the
type
of
beer
that
needs
to
be
whiskey
aged
dead
guy
just
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
flavor
however
it
is
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
gritty
probably
would
have
been
smoother
if
i
had
left
a
half
inch
or
so
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
drinkable
all
in
all
this
tastes
very
weird
though
not
unpleasant
the
barrel
bock
doesnt
work
here
nice
effort
but
not
up
to
rogues
usual
snuff
but
heres
a
tipothehate
to
further
experimentation
i
was
at
a
rogue
tasting
when
i
picked
up
this
growler
and
did
so
because
it
stood
out
the
most
among
the
6
different
rogue
brews
i
was
able
to
sample
i
am
secondguessing
that
pick
now
this
stuff
is
good
but
not
great
i
have
certainly
had
better
barrelaged
brews
still
i
would
have
this
again
and
look
forward
to
drinking
and
sharing
this
growler
dthis
actually
became
much
tougher
to
drink
towards
the
end
too
overpowering
alchohol
and
whiskey
flavor
extreme
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
playfulalmost
refreshing
one
of
the
better
recent
rogue
beers
wasnt
into
them
for
a
long
time
but
i
think
theyre
coming
back
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
adequate
zippy
carbonation
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
if
you
really
like
whiskey
this
is
your
beer
f
gets
somewhat
bitter
on
the
finish
not
really
much
of
a
hop
flavor
but
bitter
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
though
some
sticky
sweetness
and
more
sweet
malt
lager
flavors
lingering
a
little
hay
flavor
and
wheat
overall
nothing
like
i
expected
but
still
worth
a
try
d
i
am
a
little
dubious
of
the
supposed
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
but
is
is
rather
drinkable
its
an
interesting
one
to
try
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
i
nearly
thought
this
was
a
letdown
for
the
first
few
sips
and
had
i
written
this
review
at
the
beginning
of
the
bottle
i
probably
would
have
given
the
taste
a
4
5
thing
was
it
seemed
a
little
light
to
cost
as
much
as
it
did
but
i
cant
hold
that
against
this
as
its
not
supposed
to
be
a
big
beer
its
supposed
to
be
balanced
smooth
drinkable
and
wonderfully
variegated
and
its
all
of
those
with
spades
one
of
the
better
whisky
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
wellbalanced
drinkability
this
was
odd
but
interesting
i
was
happy
to
try
it
once
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
it
was
light
but
had
a
good
flavor
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
bed
thanks

a

almost

much
ive
loved
plenty
of
john

offerings
but
this
one
explodes
with
the
malts
and
whiskey
barrel
aged
effects
appears
a
pale
copper
hue
with
a
bright
off

scattered
on

hits
with
the
smoked
vanilla
and
bourbon
barrel
aging
going
on
thats
what
comes
through
in
the
beer
not
the
underlying
dead

ale
it
opens
up
the
nares
and
eyes
with
alcohol
vapors
what
a
beer
indeed
more
malt
ridden
alcohol
vanilla
bourbon
aged
light
bodied
presence
with
a
hars
oak
after
taste
is
left
on
the
palate
making
this
one
nearly
impossible
to
finish
with
a
smile
on
your
face
im
one
of
the
biggest
fans
of
rogue
beer
but
keep
your
whiskey
seperate
from
your
bread
winning
dead
guy
these
two
creations
have
no
place
joining
as
one
its
hot
with
alcohol
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
soft
and
mellow
the
body
is
medium
but
soaked
with
alcohol
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
freakin
poor
not
a
beer
i
would
ideally
indulge
in
if
i
knew
that
it
was
soaked
in
alchoolic
oak
barrels
of
whiskey
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
caramel
malts
toffee
oak
and
vanilla
taste
is
caramel
malts
toffee
vanilla
with
some
whiskey
notes
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
mouthfeel
is
chewy
oaky
smooth
and
hot
of
the
booze
via
barrel
aging
hazy
and
pale
reminds
me
of
victory
st
boisterous
in
appearance
musty
and
smoky
aroma
flavors
are
akin
to
a
very
mellow
whiskey
drink
maybe
a
ginger
ale
with
canadian
whiskey
but
very
watered
down
with
ice
tons
of
vanilla
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
that
i
wouldnt
change
a
bit
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
this
is
a
descent
beer
has
a
lot
of
characteristic
of
the
dead
guy
but
a
little
more
woody
not
a
bad
beer
enjoyed
drinking
it
d
this
could
be
a
pour
its
easy
to
drink
just
not
much
new
in
the
taste
department
not
the
best
greatest
but
not
the
worst
d
a
disapoitment
for
sure
but
it
still
is
a
an
easy
drinkin
beer
and
easy
to
enjoy
perhaps
i
would
have
liked
this
more
if
i
had
less
expectations
and
less
experience
with
rogue
and
barrel
aged
beers
but
still
the
concept
screams
out
to
be
bold
but
it
holds
back
settling
for
safe
instead
of
great
redneck
grade
slap
your
momma
your
sister
and
your
wife
not
as
far
away
from
regular
dead
guy
as
i
was
expecting
decent
but
not
exceptional
drinkability
this
is
an
amazing
harmony
of
a
spirit
and
beer
would
definitely
get
this
one
again

im
not
a
huge
rogue
fan
but
i
really
thought
that
this
might
be
the
one
to
win
me
over
no
such
luck
its
okay
but
thats
about
as
good
as
i
can
say
about
it
id
reach
for
quite
a
few
other
beers
before
this
one
barrelaged
or
not
pours
a
deep
caramel
color
and
look
a
bit
on
the
thicker
side
the
aroma
isnt
much
there
maybe
the
beer
could
of
been
a
little
bit
warmer
then
when
it
was
served
at
the
initial
taste
it
has
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
to
it
but
much
less
then
the
standard
dead
guy
ale
the
whiskey
flavor
is
much
less
then
you
would
hope
for
this
was
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
nothing
all
that
special
like
i
said
going
after
curieux
is
a
tough
job
give
this
one
a
3
5
drinkability
is
good
here
despite
the
slight
flatness
d
the
flavors
just
didnt
jive
well
together
while
i
like
some
whiskey
and
i
like
a
good
dead
guy
ale
this
combo
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
all
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
many
subtle
flavor
nuances
that
make
this
unique
drinks
very
easy
barrel
aging
is
subtle
and
it
works
very
well
here
just
a
bit
edgier
than
the
regular
dead
guy
this
is
an
easytodrink
bock
with
a
greater
level
of
hops
on
the
tonguethe
kind
of
bock
i
like
best
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
oakiness
was
very
pronounced
and
i
enjoyed
this
i
do
notice
though
that
it
overshadowed
some
of
the
subtler
aspects
of
the
beer
and
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
if
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
characteristic
drinkability
uncomfortably
unbalanced
honestly
its
a
bit
tough
to
finish
off
an
accompanying
glass
of
water
was
immediately
requested
if
someone
had
asked
me
what
i
thought
would
be
the
top
ten
best
candidates
for
barrelaging
of
any
kind
from
the
rogue
stable
dga
would
have
been
absent
from
the
list
very
interesting
beer
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
good
head
the
smell
is
a
strong
whiskey
tinged
scent
the
taste
is
good
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
maibock
more
of
a
strong
amber
ale
and
the
whiskey
really
comes
through
nicely
im
not
a
storng
amber
ale
advocate
but
this
balance
of
flavors
is
good
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
by
rogue
for
a
while
the
afterttaste
is
not
that
great
as
it
rounds
out
overwhelming
maltness
without
much
hop
flavor
but
it
isnt
bad
the
beer
is
best
while
its
in
your
mouth
it
is
fairly
drinkable
although
the
unique
flavor
makes
me
not
really
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
in
one
sitting
i
like
it
pours
a
nice
clear
bittersweet
orange
with
a
fairly
thick
orangybeige
head
that
does
not
hang
around
too
long
aroma
is
yeasty
and
woody
slightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
smoke
flavor
is
rich
malty
woody
and
a
little
yeasty
with
hints
of
smoke
and
sweetness
texture
is
silky
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
leaving
a
pleasantly
woody
finish
drinkability
nice
beer
great
for
a
whiskey
beer
for
me
drinks
fairly
easy
not
a
traditional
maibock
but
tasty
enough
i
like
where
rogue
took
this
one
the
better
barrel
bocks
ive
had
i
love
the
concept
behind
this
beer
age
dead
guy
ale
in
dead
guy
whiskey
barrels
which
itself
is
made
from
dead
guy
ales
malt
bill
it
is
totally
cute
unfortunately
the
execution
doesnt
match
the
quality
of
the
idea
its
still
a
good
beer
though
give
it
a
try
12
finger
white
head
tiny
bubbles
pretty
fast
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
orange
amber
clear
body
very
little
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
very
boozy
really
took
on
a
new
character
after
barrel
aging
hops
overwhelmed
by
the
vanilla
oak
elements
taste
is
reflective
of
nose
oak
some
vanilla
quite
boozy
the
hops
are
pushed
aside
medium
mouthfeel
smooth
a
bit
sticky
too
boozy
tasting
to
be
drinkable
needs
some
cellaring
to
calm
down
the
hot
alcohol
character
im
going
to
sit
on
the
bottled
version
for
a
while
interesting
but
too
bourbony
for
me
reviewed
from
my
notes
the
beer
is
opaque
with
an
orangecopper
color
there
is
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
that
is
slow
to
settle
it
leaves
some
lace
behind
i
can
pick
up
some
whiskey
and
oak
in
the
nose
there
is
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
hidden
behind
the
barrel
aging
aromas
i
can
taste
orange
citrus
and
sweet
caramel
malts
up
front
as
i
swallow
i
pick
up
the
whiskey
but
without
any
burning
feeling
the
finish
is
almost
a
bit
funky
its
interesting
this
aging
complements
the
already
great
dead
guy
the
beer
has
a
heavy
body
i
can
really
feel
the
carbonation
in
each
swallow
it
also
feels
a
bit
creamy
a
thin
coat
is
left
behind
my
glass
of
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
but
the
brew
isnt
as
suited
for
multiple
rounds
like
the
regular
dead
guy
is
i
can
see
the
whiskey
notes
being
offputting
to
some
drinkers
very
good
im
not
convinced
this
one
is
any
better
than
the
original
as
i
dont
know
if
the
original
beer
is
big
enough
to
hold
up
to
barrel
aging
overall
this
was
a
neat
experiment
and
an
alright
drinker
nothing
amazing
though
why
age
dead
guy
and
not
something
better
old
crusty
imperial
stout
or
even
double
dead
guy
d
very
onedimensional
with
nothing
to
offer
except
whiskey
flavor
the
dead
guy
just
doesnt
hold
its
own
against
the
barrels
sort
of
disappointing
here
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
highly
drinkable
and
thinking
back
on
this
beer
i
would
definitely
enjoy
it
if
offered
again
not
terribly
exciting
for
a
bal
aged
beer
overall
but
really
great
for
a
heller
bock
22oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
hazy
reddish
gold
with
two
fingers
of
off

toffee
in
the
aroma
mild
noble
hop

oak
really
starts
to
come
out
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
nice
oak
character
with
plenty
of
vanilla
also
a
lot
of
butterscotchtoffee
mild
hop
bitterness
lots
of
whiskey
character
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
do
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
fine
poured
a
deep
orange
color
with
excellent
carbonation
and
billowing
dirty
white
head
nose
is
pretty
faint
on
this
one
some
whiskey
but
man
it
was
not
there
for
me
taste
is
very
good
dead
guy
with
vanilla
oak
bourbo
caramel
toffee
and
butterscoych
mouthfeel
is
sweet
syrup
a
little
booze
with
a
big
sticky
vanilla
oak
presence
on
the
back
end
with
some
hop
bite
and
nice
booze
tingle
i
like
this
beer
t
the
barrel
aging
gives
vanilla
and
coconut
accents
to
this
toasty
malt
flavored
ale
the
finish
crisp
and
bitter
and
lingers
this
was
a
bit
of
a
moderately
heavy
sipper
for
me
if
your
into
the
oak
aged
thang
then
this
is
a
must
try
had
the
john
john
ale
without
really
having
tried
the
normal
dead
guy
ale
also
my
first
mailbock
i
believe
it
pours
a
great
caramel
color
with
nice
head
that
laces
the
glass
theres
a
hint
of
caramelbourbon
in
the
smell
hint
of
the
hops
in
the
smell
as
well
taste
is
a
little
sweet
but
like
a
stronger
alcohol
at
the
same
time
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
but
tolerable
a
must
for
bas
my
first
barrelaged
maibock
so
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
i
found
the
overall
quality
to
be
solid
just
not
sure
its
worth
more
than
8
a
bottle
d
i
like
the
idea
but
the
whiskeybarrel
combo
is
slightly
over
powering
nice
copper
pour
with
some
sediment
beige
foamy
head
that
settles
but
is
brought
back
with
a
bit
of
a
swirl
nose
is
malty
sweetness
carmel
not
much
alcohol
faint
whiskey
notes
taste
is
sweeter
than
i
remember
dead
guy
tasting
with
a
bitter
finish
a
nice
addition
which
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
faint
edges
of
whiskey
and
vanilla
i
am
glad
to
see
that
the
whiskey
presence
in
this
is
so
subtle
i
have
had
some
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
that
come
off
like
boiler
makers
smooth
body
light
carbonation
easy
sipper
alcohol
in
not
noticeable
nice
drinkability
if
i
had
another
i
would
have
killed
it
too
this
was
very
good
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
if
you
like
dead
guy
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
one
is
pretty
much
as
advertised
it
tastes
like
a
dead
guy
ale
with
a
good
whiskey
presence
not
my
favorite
beer
from
rogue
but
another
solid
offering
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
of
head
from
a
hard
pour
foam
is
quite
craggy
and
drops
to
show
spots
along
the
inside
of
the
glass
color
is
a
dark
gold
to
copper
4

s
the
nose
is
tough
to
decipher
with
the
exception
of
the
whiskey
that
is
quite
evident
and
really
conceals
a
lot
else
that
might
be
going
on
i
do
pick
up
a
sweet
bready
aroma
and
possibly
some
slight
earthiness
4

t
the
whisky
certainly
makes
a
showing
on
the
palate
a
smooth
butterscotch
pudding
sweetness
pervades
some
vanilla
and
oak
theres
also
a
significant
hop
bite
which
comes
through
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
some
definite
earthiness

all
around
a
very
pleasing
beer
i
was
quite
surprised

would

this
again

i
am
happy
to
see
this
experiment
with
the
rogueonrogue
barrel
aging
while
this
beer
finishes
on
the
sweeter
stickier
side
i
stand
my
their
efforts
d
this
is
a
delightful
effort
from
rogue
im
not
the
biggest
rogue
fanboy
so
im
glad
to
try
a
brew
this
good
from
them
a
little
expensive
but
its
nice
to
try
something
different
d
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
but
i
wasnt
of
the
regular
dead
guy
ale
very
slight
haze
to
this
orange
to
pale
amber
beer
not
much
head
even
with
vigorous
pour
nose
has
some
peach
skin
fruity
aromas
on
the
palate
theres
the
immediately
noticeable
high
abv
honeymalty
flavors
some
cough
drop
flavors
and
then
finishes
with
more
malty
sweet
and
alcohol
warmth
really
like
this
twist
on
rogue
dead
guy
a
bit
expensive
for
a
22oz
beer
but
all
things
considered
a
good
and
worthwhile
beer
to
seek
and
experience
interesting
take
not
a
great
beer
fun
enough
but
one
is
also
enough
curiously
the
flavor
is
no
different
the
beer
had
really
taken
on
the
essence
of
the
whiskey
with
a
soft
woodsy
peaty
flavor
like
a
scotch
rather
than
a
bourbon
sweetness
the
whiskey
is
certainly
not
overpowering
though
with
the
flavors
being
quite
soft
and
i
wouldnt
call
this
one
boozy
there
is
a
bit
of
lingering
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
the
mouthfeel
is
more
like
the
beer
i
expected
with
a
resinous
almost
buttery
texture
that
is
substantial
but
not
too
heavy
overall
this
beer
is
not
a
remarkable
experiment
but
it
is
interesting
surprising
and
pleasant
and
i
would
drink
it
again
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
my
impression
is
a
bit
on
the
meh
side
its
ok
and
with
ok
you
get
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
nothing
to
big
and
its
absolutely
not
complex
or
challenging
its
not
going
to
be
a
problem
to
kill
this
bomber
but
its
just
a
bit
of
a
let
down
for
me
it
could
be
much
more
but
this
beer
seems
a
bit
rushed
and
it
didnt
seem
to
get
very
much
attention
unless
they
were
going
after
uber
subtlety
its
ok
thats
the
best
i
can
say
d
interesting
beer
and
a
lot
lighter
on
the
barrel
character
than
i
would
have
ever
anticipated
which
in
a
way
is
nice
sometimes
its
nice
to
let
the
beer
do
most
of
the
talking
and
the
barrel
compliment
everything
else
that
is
going
on
but
there
is
still
a
lot
to
be
desired
here
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
is
missing
something
i
am
not
a
big
dead
guy
fan
but
this
worked
for
me
it
is
rare
for
such
a
small
beer
to
be
barrel
aged
and
i
think
more
brewers
should
take
a
chance
for
the
price
however
i
will
grab
something
else
pours
a
pretty
dark
gold
with
a
medium
sized
persistent
head
smell
is
mild
toasted
malt
with
a
noticeable
whiskey
note
taste
is
balanced
some
caramel
malt
some
herbal
hops
again
a
touch
of
whiskey
and
oak
is
present
and
goes
with
this
beer
nicely
not
overpowering
or
gimmicky
at
all
smooth
well
rounded
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
overall
this
is
quite
good
m
d
a
nice
light
body
but
with
nice
depth
in
flavors
drinkability
is
high
with
good
flavor
and
nice
abv
level
pours
a
hazy
reddishorange
and
topped
with
a
twofinger
fluffy
tan
head
that
lingers
a
while
before
breaking
up
and
leaving
some
thin
stripes
of
lace
behind
not
much
in
the
nose
maybe
some
caramel
malts
and
distant
hops
tastes
sweet
up
front
with
a
slight
hop
bite
in
the
middle
and
a
slightly
oaky
finish
fairly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
not
as
bold
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
not
bad
drinkability
this
beer
was
flavorful
and
satisfying
more
than
one
big
bottle
can
be
enjoyed
in
a
session
cheers
d
tasty
and
not
a
high
abv
but
the
amount
of
oak
and
smokey
flavors
get
to
be
a
chore
after
a
while
not
something
id
want
more
than
one
of
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
drinkability
is
good
very
balanced
beer
and
solid
through
out
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
ale
drinkability
a
good
beer
only
if
you
like
the
oak
taste
i
think
this
one
may
be
overly
oaked
and
it
looses
some
of
the
flavors
that
make
the
original
so
tasty
i
would
pick
this
one
up
if
i
needed
an
oak
fix
but
otherwise
would
pass
for
a
beer
with
such
a
nice
balance
of
robust
flavors
the
john
john
ale
doesnt
smell
like
much
the
taste
is
bold
but
in
no
way
overbearing
with
caramel
vanilla
and
bourbon
which
gives
way
to
a
hoppy
finish
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
honey
and
a
lingering
whiskey
and
oak
flavor
this
is
a
delicious
beer
smoothness
and
drinkability
are
exceptional
especially
at
6
4
abv
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
offering
a
lot
of
flavor
with
a
modest
amount
of
alcohol
a
good
beer
for
night
sessioning
the
original
dead
guy
is
a
classic
but
i
really
just
dont
think
this
treatment
worked
as
well
as
it
could
have
dont
think
i
will
buy
a
bottle
of
this
one
d
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
another
quality
brew
from
rogue
notes
certainly
worse
than
their
dead
guy
ale
which
albeit
not
extraordinary
is
a
pretty
ok
brew
here
it
feels
like
they
messed
it
up
for
the
sake
of
it
with
the
barrels
and
the
results
are
subpar
the
design
is
not
necessarily
horrid
but
lingers
on
a
label
that
a
couple
of
guys
on
a
brewing
session
would
have
taken
and
slapped
on
the
bottle
lazily
good
for
them
but
something
that
i
would
not
encourage
using
on
a
label
but
this
would
be
somewhat
irrelevant
if
at
least
the
brew
inside
were
truly
worthy
but
put
this
brew
together
with
this
presentation
and
sure
you
got
something
else
in
your
hands
worth
a
shot
decent
body
and
a
nice
easy
drinker
candy
sweetness
on
the
palate
but
not
cloyingly
so
as
the
crisp
carbonation
level
and
whiskeyaging
add
a
zippy
spice
profile
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
fruity
notes
of
pineapple
and
mandarin
orange
throughout
medium
mouthfeel
is
peppery
with
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
whiskey
warms
the
stomach
halfway
through
the
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
given
rogues
recent
track
record
but
this
is
a
tasty
unique
take
on
the
barrelaging
phenomenon
kudos
to
rogue
nation
pours
a
cloudy
honey
brown
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
bready
with
an
oakywhiskey
twang
very
subtle
aromas
nothing
crazy
taste
is
that
of
a
whiskey
spritzer
which
is
quite
ok
nice
whiskey
flavor
but
in
good
proportion
to
the
style
it
has
a
nice
oak
barrel
sourness
and
whiskey
flavor
followed
by
a
general
malt
sweetness
with
vanilla
to
boot
i
cant
say
that
i
can
pick
up
any
specific
malt
flavor
the
whiskey
seems
to
neutralize
that
but
it
does
a
good
job
balances
the
barrel
flavors
the
feel
is
on
the
light
side
with
nice
carbonation
drinks
well
fairly
crisp
for
a
whiskey
barrel
aged
brew
this
drinks
incredibly
awesome
the
barrel
flavors
are
perfect
for
the
malt
body
it
drinks
light
but
as
real
nice
flavors
very
tasty
give
this
sucka
a
try
d
good
the
hops
seem
a
little
out
of
place
to
me
but
it
is
still
tasty
for
the
price
though
i
dont
think
this
is
something
i
will
be
grabbing
again
it
seems
like
there
are
comparable
beers
for
less
drinkability
is
not
good
and
i
would
never
buy
this
again
in
my
pilsner
glass
this
was
a
really
attractive
beer
coppercolored
thick
white
head
resembling
whipped
cream
some
lacing
nice
caramel
malt
aroma
a
bit
of
whiskey
caramel
taste
some
whiskey
and
late
hoppiness
a
good
maibock
i
hope
rogue
does
some
more
barrel
aging
d
i
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
drinkable
a
lot
of
the
whiskey
barrel
aged
beers
seem
to
have
a
stronger
flavor
than
this
one
but
i
think
it
works
here
ill
pick
up
another
if
i
get
the
opportunity
more
please
great
flavor
great
value
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
i
guess
but
dont
buy
too
many
of
these
im
really
interested
in
trying
the
rum
barrel
brown
ale
now
hopefully
its
a
bit
better
i
am
not
a
fan
of
dead
guy
but
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
its
worth
your
time
taste
is
creamy
malt
butterscotch
a
tad
sweet
caramel
and
hops
found
in
the
back
ends
smooth
and
a
little
dry
d
highly
drinkable
so
tasty
rather
light
body
with
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
in
interesting
barrel
aged
beer
like
a
good
whiskey
without
any
of
the
alcohol
heat
definitely
a
beer
for
whiskey
lovers
i
enjoyed
the
smoky
and
oak
qualities
of
it
a
ale
or
maibockwho
knowsbut
i
have
always
kinda
liked
the
dead
guyoak
aging
it
left
me
skeptical
but
i
liked
it

be
found
if
you
look
hard
enough
d
an

brew
to
say
the

yes
yet
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
if
youre
a
fan
of
dead
guy
you
may
or
may
not
like
this
beer
its
sort
of
hit
or
miss
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
revisit
poured
into
a
new
belgium
goblet
orangeamber
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
very
strong
of
vanilla
and
whiskey
cant
really
scent
anything
from
the
helles
bock
the
taste
is
very
interesting
the
regular
dead
guy
is
there
but
there
are
strong
whiskey
flavor
up
front
that
mellows
out
to
a
very
strong
vanilla
note
there
is
also
an
odd
flavor
its
almost
like
an
artificial
peach
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
no
alcohol
burn
from
the
bock
or
from
the
whiskey
flavor
good
malty
aroma
and
flavor
great
dark
color
and
a
lot
of
character
for
a
beer
this
low
in
alcohol
d
not
very
high
for
me
as
this
beer
is
very
woody
for
my
palate
this
could
be
more
epic
had
they
aged
double
dead
instead
to
bring
more
body
and
depth
along
with
aging
potential
d
a
dangerous
sipper
indeed
i
honestly
felt
like
i
was
sipping
a
whiskey
high
ball
the
woodaged
character
and
flavor
is
so
pronounced
and
makes
this
6
4
abv
bock
one
smooth
criminal
i
could
easily
have
had
a
few
before
during
and
after
dinner
nice
work
rogue
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
make
the
beer
seem
boozier
than
it
is
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
which
is
definitely
different
from
most
barrelaged
bourbon
tasting
beers
i
have
tried
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
if
anything
this
is
just
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
very
very
nice
indeed
drinks
so
easily
and
so
well
i
will
have
no
problem
putting
22
oz
of
this
down
an
all
around
well
crafted
beer
that
is
so
unique
for
this
style
i
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
one
given
its
lovely
whiskey
taste
decent
hop
profile
and
lightness
id
be
drinking
this
often
pretty
good
drinkability
not
overly
exciting
but
fun
to
try
i
could
have
enjoyed
a
stronger
oak
or
a
stronger
likeness
to
dead
guy
instead
it
is
kind
of
halfway
in
between
the
two
with
nether
a
clear
leaderfocus
or
a
congruent
balance
pours
a
clear
orangy
lightbrown
color
with
minimal
head
smell
is
of
carmel
with
a
touch
of
toasted
grain
and
vanilla
faint
hints
of
whiskey
coconut
tropical
fruit
taste
is
a
delicious
mild
yet
well
blended
concoction
of
toasted
grains
sweet
carmel
vanilla
oak
whiskey
tropical
fruit
and
coconut
great
smooth
body
light
carbonation
not
sticky
and
no
aftertaste
very
good
beer
the
coconut
was
a
big
suprise
and
the
toned
down
whiskey
heat
is
very
welcomed
after
too
many
barrel
aged
beers
going
overboard
pours
a
clear
copper
medium
aber
color
with
good
bubbling
the
head
dissipates
pretty
quick
but
leaves
some
nice
filmy
foamy
film
on
the
top
the
aroma
is
a
toasty
caramel
malt
snuff
but
lets
not
forget
the
hint
of
vanilla
and
oak
whiskey
that
gives
you
a
little
suffle
of
interest
towards
the
end
of
each
sniff
the
taste
starts
with
wet
toasted
bread
with
a
little
unsalted
butter
on
it
the
middle
has
a
more
caramel
and
toasted
grain
flavor
with
just
a
splash
of
mellow
whiskey
the
finish
is
amost
creamy
in
texture
with
some
vanilla
and
even
more
mellow
whiskey
flavors
but
added
t
that
comes
the
very
faintly
roasted
oak
barrels
that
the
whiskey
was
aged
in
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
original
dead
guy
ale
this
is
sessionable
but
since
it
an
oak
aged
whiskey
barrel
maibock
it
seems
almost
a
little
too
specia
for
a
session
beer
d
tastes
good
alcohol
is
hidden
its
very
drinkable
just
not
what
i
was
expecting

i
never

this
would

a

candidate
for

but
nonetheless
and
although
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
heavy
on
the
sweet
side
overall
this
is
not
a
good
representation
of
a
bock
helles
or
maibock
it
is
way
too
sweet
there
are
some
spring
bock
features
maybe
a
touch
of

the
hops
are
not

good
carbonation
overall
an
above
average
beer
o
not
a
bad
brew
my
first
from
starr
hill
brewery
paired
well
with
the
buffalo
chicken
salad
i
was
enjoying
good
enough
that
i
ordered
another
while
i
polished
off
my
lunch
this
is
supposedly
a
winter
seasonal
brew
but
i
dont
get
it
id
drink
this
in
the
summer
fall
but
nothing
about
this
beer
says
winter
cheers
iid
this
was
painfully
average
and
nothing
ill
ever
have
again
unless
given
swigged
this
one
straight
from
the
bottle
at
a
holiday
party
apparently
this
varietal
is
actually
a
special
seasonal
but
couldnt
really
pick
that
up
from
the
label
nor
the
taste
this
came
in
a
regular
variety
pack
along
with
the
northern
lights
red
ale
and
imperial
stout
by
the
time
i
got
to
this
one
i
didnt
holdout
much
hope
in
addition
to
the
i
dont
think
maibocks
bring
much
to
the
table
in
general
it
was
surprisingly
light
with
a
sweet
finish
the
website
states
that
is
uses
munich
malts
helping
pacify
my
taste
buds
into
thinking
this
is
a
german
original
seemed
like
a
typical
lager
descent
beer
best
of
the
mixed
case
o
for
the
price
you
could
do
much
worse
and
as
i
said
this
is
starr
hill
at
its
best
in
my
opinion
o
a
good
solid
lager
worthy
of
the
winter
season
but
able
to
hold
its
own
any
time
of
year
worth
picking
up
a
few
more
the
next
time
im
at
the
store
drinkability
goes
down
kind
of
smooth
not
too
bad
pretty
average
brew
considering
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
style
somewhat
reminds
me
of
a
winter
beer
maybe
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
would
recommend
it
still
goes
down
pretty
smooth
this
tastes
much
like
an
adjunct
lager
it
has
off
flavors
presumably
from
poor
temperature
management
during
the
lagering
process
i
definitely
wont
have
this
again
o
not
the
most
popular
style
in
the
world
but
i
dig
it
on
occasion
this
was
nice
but
one
was
totally
enough
for
me
this
beer
is
labeled
as
a
winter
bock
but
its
a
little
lighter
in
color
than
i
would
expect
for
a
beer
with
this
designation
and
its
taste
is
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
im
not
sure
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
due
to
its
candy
like
character
but
i
can
agree
that
it
has
some
interesting
things
to
offer
very
nice
maibock
i
like
it
bought
as
part
of
a
sampler
pack
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
not
much
head
to
it
very
little
in
the
aroma
department
taste
is
light
to
medium
bodied
sort
of
boozy
some
honey
and
strong
malts
mouthfeel
is
not
great
very
low
drinkability
im
not
a
big
fan
of
bocksmaibocks
to
begin
with
but
this
one
is
just
not
good
even
hard
to
drink
even
way
too
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
for
only
a
6
5
abv
and
the
taste
is
just
lacking
ill
pass
comments
a
fine
beer
for
winter
weather
for
those
of
us
that
arent
hop
heads
i
havent
tried
this
style
of
beer
before
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
maybe
a
bit
of
the
sweet
side
though
not
bad
far
better
than
some
of
the
others
ive
had
from
this
brewery
o
light
and
easydrinking
this
is
no
doubt
a
refreshing
beer
there
was
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
though
this
did
mellow
a
bit
as
the
beer
warmed
this
is
a
winter
offering
from
starr
hill
but
one
could
argue
it
would
be
better
suited
for
a
warmer
time
of
year
as
its
not
the
type
of
beer
to
knock
the
chill
off
that
said
its
a
nice
choice
to
have
in
good
company
and
one
that
ill
enjoy
again
in
the
future
overall
not
having
anything
else
from
starr
hill
i
appreciate
this
brew
as
a
bock
i
would
like
something
more
beer
is
medium
in
body
has
a
little
roastiness
at
the
end
and
an
aftertaste
that
shouldnt
be
there
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
fine
i
guess
i
wont
have
more
though
overall
i
am
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
but
the
platinum
made
me
want
to
try
them
again
this
is
not
a
dismal
failure
it
is
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
have
again
carbonation
has
a
nice
background
role
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
a
little
creamy
the
taste
notes
are
very
grainy
but
not
wheat
very
malty
there
is
a
bitterness
at
the
end
that
could
use
more
of
what
i
cant
tell
you
but
it
doesnt
quite
finish
with
a
bang
it
is
a
good
beer
not
sure
what
winterbocks
are
supposed
to
be
but
i
like
the
versatility
of
this
beer
may
buy
it
again
if
it
is
on
sale
or
on
tap
overall
nothing
special
but
it
is
another
solid
part
of
the
starr
hill
lineup
this
beer
is
just
ok
i
thought
the
flavor
was
lacking
and
could
have
used
more
maltiness
pours
a
dark
pretty
yellow
thick
head
dissipates
quickly
there
are
a
number
of
flavors
going
on
here
a
little
spice
a
little
sweet
some
nutmeggy
notes
its
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
then
that
these
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
so
that
it
goes
together
well
but
also
makes
it
difficult
to
detect
any
one
it
finishes
sweet
and
lingers
o
while
this
particular
experience
was
mediocre
i
know
for
a
fact
this
is
a
great
beer
even
from
the
bottle
i
bought
four
cases
in
one
go
when
they
went
on
sale
and
regretted
it
only
slightly
definitely
recommended
it
does
not
taste
near
its
strength
and
is
likely
to
be
popular
even
with
non

it

last
at

as

fairly

however
the
sulfury

dont

develop

it

enjoyed
the

and
will

i
can

that

does
not

overall
a

i
realize
that
a
slightly
heftier

bill
with
additional
sweetness
is
probably
what
makes
this
a
winter
appropriate
lager
but
it
seemed
slightly
out

balance
to
me
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
unusual
choice
it
seems
for
a
winter

that
the
style
is
of
a
spring

i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
drinkability
a

still

very

beer
doesnt

the

the
strong

you
would

of
beer

nothing

definitely
had

to
see
a

that
early
in

season
this
was
tasty
little
bock
from
starr

that
had
just
enough
hop
character
to
nicely
balance
out
all
of
those
heavy
malts

i
could

release
i
like
this

good

a

pleasant

this
has
an

a

if
youre
in

area
starr

is
an
unheralded
option
that
you
wont
be
disappointed
by
d
quite
drinkable
and
a
lot
lighter
than
the
abv
would
lead
me
to
believe
this
may
be
my
favorite
starr

though
its
in
serious
competition
with
the
love
d
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
drinkability

a
friend
brought
a
sixer
of
these
over

than
the
other
starr

efforts
ive
tried
very
nice
winter
brew
from
starr
hill
kind
of
strange
to
say
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
wit
in
some
ways
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
winter
warmer
and
a
wheat
beer
even
though
there
isnt
any
wheat
in
it
good
beer

nice
clean
smooth

with
a
hoppy

and
some
minor
malty

good
finish
to
an
alright
beer
drinkability
is
acceptable
for
the
style
but
not
my
preference
to
date
d
a
really
good
bock
which
while
a
little
twodimensional
is
still
really
enjoyable
especially
if
you
like
malty
brews
this
is
a
great
session
beer
even
at
6
very
simple
but
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
plus
it
is
brewed
right
down
the
road
from
me
which
rocks
a
helles

probably
my
favorite

this

i
like
in

into

finish
a
decent
amount
of

it
gives
it
a
nice

try

i
had
it
at
the
taphouse
in
hampton
va
and
must
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
what
i
would
call
golden
ale
but
i
think
it
isnt
an
ale
at
all
nice
color
with
a
great
beer
scent
and
just
right
on
hops
and
malt
i
would
drink
it
more
if

this

doesnt

its

in

succeeds
at
being
precisely
what
it
is
and
then
some
right
up
there
with
the
pale

as
being
my
favorite
starr

brew
this
ones
simply
a
wellcrafted

i
could

toss

a

and
true

a

i

i
cracked
this
bad
boy
open
and
oh
how
i
wanted
to
canduct
an
inverted
glug
but
i
canstrained
myself
due
to
its
relative
age
i
cannot
take
the
chance
that
one
of
these
beers
might
be
canditioned
so
i
felt
canpelled
to
go
with
a
gentle
pour
when
this
only
netted
me
a
skim
of
lighttan
head
i
cantinued
to
employ
the
bartenders
trick
and
give
it
a
good
agitation
soon
i
had
two
fingers
of
lighttan
head
that
quickly
fell
back
to
wisps

sticky

warming
finish
a
smooth
sipper
ehhh
this
isnt
so
impressive
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
its
a
maibock
a
real
miss
on
the
style
its
a
smooth
hoppy
lager
that
is
a
bit
too
overwhelming
in
the
citrus
rind
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
well
above
average
flavor
and
a
slightly
grainy
sweet
bitter
finish
that
can
seem
dry
or
clean
at
times
this
was
very
interesting
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
my
expectations
were
low
for
a
bockmaibock
collaboration
from
a
can
but
this
shocked
me
with
really
good
flavor
and
pretty
peculiar
qualities
that
made
for
a
tasty
beer
experience
to
me
this
was
the
sleeper
brew
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12
pack
since
i
expected
to
crack
the
top
and
just
throw
this
back
but
it
was
really
enjoyable
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
which
kind
of
seems
all
over
the
place
but
is
easy
to
drink
not
worth
a
second
visit
though
had
this
beer
on
tap
yesterday
122414
at
the
green
onion
pub
in
utica
ny
i
wanted
to
review
it
because
a
previous
rating
narrative
described
yonder
bock
as
cloyingly
sweet
i
find
that
description
peculiar
in
that
i
found
the
taste
to
be
exceptionally
dry
showing
that
it
was
effectively
fermented
maybe
i
got
an
old
batch
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
batch
or
maybe
my
sense
of
taste
is
beginning
to
wane
the
fact
is
this
beer
was
dry
almost
as
if
it
had
a
touch
of
brett
in
the
ferment
though
it
didnt
anyway
easy
drinking
at
7
7
great
hop
content
for
a
lager
that
kind
of
took
it
out
of
the
maibock
range
but
who
cares
adhering
to
beer
style
rules
is
a
thing
of
the
past
us
brewers
are
making
the
best
beer
in
the
world
right
now
by
breaking
the
rules

overall
a
decent
suitable
maibock
t
very
light
with
a
slight
malty
breadiness
as
it
warms
it
tastes
like
grape
bubblicious
as
well
kind
of
strange
d
a
good
spicy
fruity
and
floral
brew
with
the
fine
drinkability
of
a
german
pilsener
or
lager
but
the
fullbodied
malt
backbone
of
a
study
bock
beer
the
6
5
abv
would
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
while
but
the
combination
of
malt
bittersweetness
floral
roastiness
and
snappy
herbal
hop
finish
are
a
very
drinkable
combination
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
pale
gold
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
very
mild
aroma
some
biscuitlike
malt
and
lightly
sulfurous
lager
yeast
as
it
warms
i
pick
out
more
maltyhoney
sweetness
its
light
and
clean
on
the
palate
but
decidedly
more
malty
than
spatens
helles
lager
theres
little
in
the
way
of
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
and
semidry
a
bit
bland
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
full
of
malt
medium
bodied
slightly
spritzy
sweet
up
front
leading
to
a
mildly
sour
but
addictive
aftertaste
poured
a
pale
goldencopper
clarity
was
translucent
head
was
one
inch
dense
rocky
and
white
in
color
nose
was
very
light
something
of
a
subtle
wheat
character
and
a
hint
of
light
fruit
taste
follows
nose
wheat
malt
dominates
but
the
fruit
is
definitely
more
present
and
some
light
toffee
notes
are
revealed
as
well
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
however
there
is
some
consistency
here
maybe
better
described
as
a
slickness
an
even
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
this
is
an
exceptional
maibock
perhaps
the
best
ive
had
i
found
this
beer
to
be
tasty
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
and
also
somewhat
refreshing
well
worth
your
time
if
you
get
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
d
a
good
maibock
lots
of
malts
here
would
definitely
try
again
quite
drinkable
for
a
bock
refreshing
and
flavorful
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
the
best
that
i
have
had
in
this
style
one
not
to
miss
when
you
see
it
on
tap
found
this
on
tap
at
teskes
german
restaurant
in
san
jose
ca
enjoyed
in
a
big
ass
mug
fitting
the
german
stereotype
its
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
healthy
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
sharp
wheat
and
citrus
with
malt
liquor
underpinnings
the
flavor
offers
thick
malt
and
flowery
bread
its
all
you
need
to
know
crisp
and
lively
with
big
carbonation
yet
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
touch
of
chewiness
quite
drinkable
refreshing
and
flavorful
a
most
anytime
brew
and
one
not
to
miss
when
you
see
it
on
tap
fresh
and
crispy
like
this
the
beer
pours
a
goldorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
bready
malt
and
some
corn
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
bready
malt
grapes
and
floral
hops
the
flowers
and
grapes
stand
out
quite
a
bit
and
a
are
a
bit
overwhelming
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
great
golden
color
interesting
aroma
outstanding
flavor
lots
of
malty
flavor
without
being
too
strong
i
love
this
beer
d
this
is
quite
a
good
maibock
not
my
favourite
style
but
it
is
well
made
and
true
to
the
character
of
the
may
bock
bier
classic
german
lager
d
very
good
drinkability
in
this
beer
i
have
to
be
honest
and
say
that
my
first
thought
is
that
it
reminded
me
of
capitals
maibock
probably
a
big
compliment
to
the
cap
but
certainly
a
nice
bavarian
maibock
on
its
own
444
544
stopped
by
jacob
wirth
last
night
with
some
friends
for
beer
and
pretzels
this
maibock
was
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
bright
yellow
color
but
slightly
hazy
body
very
large
white
head
had
a
yeasty
and
slightly
citrus
smell
taste
was
extremely
full
of
malt
almost
a
bit
too
much
somewhat
surprising
for
such
a
light
colored
beer
on
the
down
side
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
it
seems
to
be
overly
thick
and
sticky
on
the
palate
which
seemed
to
detract
from
the
drinkability
i
am
not
sure
if
i
like
a
maibock
that
is
this
malty
i
would
probably
not
order
another
one
of
these
from
spaten
again
not
worth
the
6
50
pricetag
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
some
honey
highlights
and
a
small
wispy
white
that
the
basically
settles
into
nothingness
the
aroma
is
that
of
the
doughy
munich
malt
black
pepper
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
similiar
to
the
aroma
doughy
munich
malt
pepper
honey
and
mineral
water
like
a
heavy
munich
lager
which
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
smooth
flavor
not
grainy
with
a
dash
of
spice
from
the
hops
moderate
body
slightly
chewy
with
tingly
carbonation
finishes
very
smooth
a
nice
drinking
maibock
abv
respectable
not
ridiculous
fine
brew
nice
overall
drinkability
a
good
lager
for
a
nice
spring
day
on
a
bier
garten
patio
overall
this
is
the
best
maibock
that
ive
ever
tasted
its
so
great
to
have
fresh
german
brews
in
the
us
poured
medium
gold
that
looked
quite
enticing
with
modest
head
that
was
a
good
contrasting
white
nose
had
clean
malty
aromas
on
the
palate
the
malt
came
through
nicely
with
a
focus
on
the
malt
sweetness
but
not
overly
sweet
light
hoppiness
for
balance
and
washes
down
very
clean
and
malty
excellent
beer
another
delicious
german
lager
to
give
you
the
rundown
this
looks
pretty
good
tastes
pretty
good
and
will
kick
your
ass
it
has
a
pale
orange
color
but
with
a
bit
of
body
to
it
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
reminds
me
of
drinking
honeysuckle
with
a
sizzle
of
hops
and
a
pinch
of
alcohol
medium
to
full
bodied
not
difficult
to
put
down
although
a
little
monotone
in
flavor
the
balance
is
good
in
this
beer
oh
and
you
may
want
some
small
snacks
in
front
you
if
you
plan
drinking
a
large
quantity
of
it
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
fresh
light
and
easy
to
sip
i
could
easily
have
several
or
return
to
this
two
key
words
here
are
balance
and
subtlety
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
alone
or
with
very
mild
food
i
came
close
to
not
reviewing
this
beer
at
first
i
questioned
whether
or
not
i
was
actually
served
the
correct
beer
i
really
questioned
how
this
beer
could
be
so
far
off
from
the
traditional
style
especially
coming
from
spaten
after
consulting
with
another
knowledgeable
individual
i
was
assured
that
this
was
norm
for
this
beer
spaten
needs
to
reconsider
its
recipe
in
my
opinion
drinkability
i
would
recommend
allowing
this
beer
to
warm
a
bit
from
typical
refrigerator
temp
the
body
and
profile
becomes
much
more
rounded
and
balanced
once
warm
on
tap
at
the
glockenspiel
restaurant
in
st
paul
poured
a
clear
strawgolden
color
with
an
inch
or
so
of
white
foam
aroma
comes
forward
with
bready
malts
vanilla
and
flowery
noble
hops
unfortunately
i
also
detect
a
noticeable
amount
of
dms
cooked
cream
corn
which
i
will
ignore
for
now
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
but
at
least
the
dms
is
not
so
bad
here
nice
rich
mouthfeel
without
being
heavy
and
finishes
just
a
touch
sweet
hop
bitterness
is
restrained
but
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
nicely
very
thirst
quenching
without
the
dms
this
beer
would
be
really
awesome
so
i
will
just
assume
that
it
was
just
one
bad
keg
i
would
definately
order
it
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
a
slightly
sweet
taste
upfront
but
finished
with
a
dry
note
and
a
hint
of
the
hops
carbonation
was
right
on
overall
very
refreshing
spaten
has
been
brewing
beer
for
over
600
years
so
it
figures
they
know
what
theyre
doing
good
stuff
got
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
addison
this
beer
poured
a
yellowgolden
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
the
overall
taste
and
smell
went
with
your
standard
bocks
left
a
very
warm
feeling
once
the
glass
was
completed
i
look
forward
to
making
this
a
spring
staple
at
my
favorite
watering
hole
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thick
finebubbled
white
head
aroma
is
strongly
malty
and
has
a
fruity
hint
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
and
has
a
good
zing
to
it
not
complex
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
texture
is
smooth
and
pleasant
a
nice
spring
ale
this
one
gets
a
lot
better
as
it
warms
so
keep
that
in
mind
beer
is
a
standard
bock
look
light
brown
with
copper
highlights
a
small
head
that
dissolves
fast
nose
is
light
spicy
malt
a
touch
of
fruit
taste
is
likewise
although
stronger
spices
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
feel
is
solid
good
body
with
nice
funky
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
maibocks
but
i
prefer
the
dead
guy
pint
from
raleighs
flying
saucer
served
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
to
nothing
aroma
was
a
little
weak
some
sweet
malts
and
sweet
fruits
not
much
else
the
taste
was
a
wonderful
malt
abundance
with
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
quite
tasty
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
but
it
tends
to
be
hard
to
find
most
of
the
time
id
have
no
problem
session
drinking
these
especially
in
the
springsummer
heat
got
this
ontap
at
a
local
irish
bar
never
heard
of
maibock
from
spaten
so
i
gave
it
a
go
had
a
golden
light
color
to
it
with
a
small
frothy
head
had
some
hoppiness
to
the
nose
and
some
maltiness
as
well
tasted
very
unique
looking
at
it
youd
expect
it
to
be
lagerlike
but
it
had
a
very
nice
and
surprising
maltiness
to
it
the
hops
were
present
and
were
warm
and
spicy
very
drinkable
beer
a
real
treat
overall
a
very
tasty
bock
with
very
good
drinkability
goldenstraw
colors
slightly
murky
thick
2
finger
head
smelled
sweet
and
floral
the
taste
was
fresh
and
earthy
strong
floral
hops
with
some
spice
yeast
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
taste
to
round
it
off
left
a
long
floral
aftertaste
sitting
on
my
tongue
which
combined
with
its
light
carbonation
and
slightly
heavy
feel
gave
this
beer
a
wonderful
moutfeel
drinkable
and
enjoyable
looks
like
a
pilsner
or
kolsch
with
a
golden
straw
yellow
color
this
is
a
nice
standard
maibock
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
of
apple
juicelike
malts
with
a
touck
of
bocklicorice
and
a
earthyspicy
hops
taste
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
and
you
probably
would
too
served
in
a
halfliter
spaten
mug
the
beer
looked
basically
like
a
czech
pilsner
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
into
nice
lacing
it
did
not
have
the
amber
tinge
ive
seen
in
some
maibocks
the
smell
was
all
caramel
malt
and
hop
bitterness
taste
was
even
bigger
on
the
caramel
flavors
with
hop
bitterness
showing
through
in
the
end
there
was
also
some
graininess
throughout
mouthfeel
was
crisp
dry
and
a
little
syrupy
an
interesting
combination
i
had
no
trouble
putting
away
half
a
liter
of
this
stuff
on
a
warm
summer
evening
d
very
nice
maibock
i
was
very
happy
to
find
this
available
good
drinkability
opinion
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
clean
and
super
easy
to
drink
which
may
confuse
some
people
into
thinking
that
this
beer
lacks
substance
it
has
a
squeakyclean
malt
presence
that
even
holds
up
after
it
is
warm
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
a
damn
bood
helles
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
fond
this
beer
on
tap
at
my
favorite
german
restaurant
in
portland
gustavs
they
have
it
all
year
around
despite
the
seasonal
availability
noted
above
poured
into
a
traditional
german
bier
stein
nice
thick
white
head
that
left
a
descent
amount
of
lace
as
i
finished
my
stein
very
sweet
almost
honey
like
on
the
nose
pale
yellow
in
color
great
alcoholic
zip
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
bit
of
straw
like
hops
on
the
finish
nice
carbonation
overall
a
great
brew
to
go
with
a
fantastic
dinner
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
dry
and
crisp
substantial
but
easy
very
nice
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
large
bubbly
head
very
carbonated
smell
is
floral
with
very
noticeable
hops
light
malts
in
the
back
taste
follows
suit
is
a
bit
like
an
ipa
hoppy
has
some
decent
flavors
but
the
bitterness
lingers
with
only
some
compensation
i
was
expecting
some
fuller
flavors
but
good
drinkability
and
altogether
decently
enjoyable
d
very
very
tasty
seasonal
brew
size
and
alcohol
content
here
would
discourage
me
from
making
this
a
session
beer
but
definitely
something
to
catch
while
its
around
spatens
maibock
is
a
rather
descent
brew
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
moderately
foamy
head
the
smell
is
of
the
sweet
malts
within
the
taste
is
pleasant
being
malty
but
nicley
balanced
this
is
a
good
brew
worth
giving
a
go
if
you
see
it
on
tap
some
place
on
tap
at
the
pizza
plant
on
transitpoured
a
dull
golden
with
a
rather
thin
head
with
nothing
left
behind
as
it
settled
quickly
cooked
grain
aromas
mainly
a
touch
of
honeymalt
but
nothing
strongnow
the
flavors
to
me
were
more
assertive
quite
grainy
and
vegetale
with
some
token
sweetness
and
spicey
hop
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
not
assertive
but
is
noticablei
like
a
good
spring
bock
and
this
fit
the
bill
nicely
for
me
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
not
much
else
to
say
really
drinkability
is
superb
i
easily
put
down
my
half
liter
the
menu
said
9
but
i
definately
didnt
detect
a
bit
of
alcohol
highly
quafable
with
a
nice
clean
malty
finish
glad
i
ordered
this
one
served
in
a
large
tulip
glass
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
floating
over
the
rest
of
the
beer
which
was
a
pale
semiopaque
golden
color
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
was
left
behind
in
my
glass
the
carbonation
level
was
moderate
with
soft
bubbles
surfacing
slowly
aromas
of
hard
candy
roasted
malt
ginger
and
alcohol
seemed
to
come
out
nicely
the
taste
was
sweet
with
fruitlaiden
backbone
making
it
seem
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
maibock
various
malt
flavors
and
fruit
flavors
came
out
with
time
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
impressive
sweetness
that
rolled
into
a
mild
hop
profile
and
finished
slightly
sour
a
bit
thin
and
slick
in
the
mouth
but
still
highly
drinkable
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
i
like
bocks
and
the
more
bocky
the
better
this
is
indeed
a
bock
but
a
bit
thinner
and
more
rocky
in
presentation
thatn
i
would
gravitate
toward
dont
get
me
wrong
in
a
pinch
it
would
help
fill
a
bock
jones
but
with
others
so
available
i
dont
see
myself
coming
back
this
way
again
it
was
good
to
try
but
now
i
know
its
close
enough
to
just
average
that
i
have
better
options
available
to
me
pint
at
flying
saucer
in
raleigh
now
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
strong
but
still
quaffable
overall
5
75
for
a
liter
of
this
is
what
i
paid
excellent
deal
if
you
ask
me
ide
had
enough
after
the
one
liter
but
it
was
enjoyable
while
it
lasted
d
very
nice
i
wish
i
could
find
this
on
tap
clean
and
clear
golden
hues
crystalline
with
few
bubbles
lingering
big
foamy
white
head
that
faded
slighted
but
laced
the
glass
smells
almost
like
a
white
zinfandel
which
was
kind
of
weird
but
pleasant
a
bit
sweet
and
something
that
amounts
to
raw
almonds
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
reasonably
hoppy
and
pleasant
no
lingering
aftertaste
and
felt
smooth
and
full
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
summer
day
the
aftertaste
is
malted
too
just
a
hint
of
hop
in
the
finish
decent
bock
241
drinkable
yes
it
is
ive
now
tried
this
multiple
times
ontap
at
the
huberhaus
in
omaha
i
belly
up
to
the
bar
and
order
round
after
round
this
is
a
solid
maibock
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
deep
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
hmmm
looks
like
a
pilsner
the
aroma
is
a
clean
malty
smell
mixed
with
a
citrus
hop
very
crisp
smelling
hmmm
smells
like
a
pilsner
very
crisp
tasting
crisp
pilsner
taste
from
german
hops
hallertau
crisp
hop
flavor
more
grapefruit
slick
mouth
feel
good
drinakbility
except
for
the
addition
of
a
good
strong
hop
flavor
this
came
off
to
me
like
a
pilsner
thats
not
bad
just
not
true
to
style
i
liked
this
beer
and
will
have
another
in
the
future
from
notes
this
beer
arrived
a
slightly
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
weak
save
some
honey
and
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
was
not
good
to
me
astringent
harsh
grainey
quality
dominated
a
slight
caramel
finish
the
feel
was
moderate
overall
i
found
this
beer
lacking
i
will
be
avoiding
it
in
the
future
drinkability
really
surprised
me
especially
since
i
went
into
the
restaurant
with
a
thirst
for
a
big
dark
beer
but
i
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
a
little
too
meaty
to
be
too
sessionable
but
that
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
bocks
are
typically
a
springtime
beer
and
the
springlike
qualities
of
the
beer
make
it
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
on
tap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
medium
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
head
theres
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
nicely
balanced
with
sweet
caramel
malt
mixing
well
with
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
about
the
same
its
very
malty
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
it
tastes
almost
like
a
pilsener
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
maibock
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
white
head
that
is
a
pleasure
the
smell
is
a
nice
sweet
caramel
and
floral
hop
that
added
great
distinction
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
nice
smooth
rich
caramel
with
a
nice
light
floral
fruit
hop
a
slight
mixed
berry
taste
goes
well
with
the
caramel
smoothness
nice
effort
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
came
in
a
pint
glass
and
had
a
nice
golden
color
to
it
smell
consisted
of
malts
grains
with
some
honey
and
sweet
aromas
in
there
not
bad
taste
wasnt
bad
either
a
little
bitter
to
start
out
then
the
sweetness
kinda
explode
in
your
mouth
combined
with
some
malts
and
grains
mouthfeel
was
ok
the
sweetness
was
a
little
cloying
at
times
which
brought
down
the
drinkability
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
order
this
if
you
see
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
be
ordering
again
ontap
at
gasthas
bavarian
hunter
in
stillwater
served
in
a
dimpled
liter
mug
approaches
me
a
glowingly
solid
thickset
gold
color
with
a
firm
thin
white
cap
of
foam
aroma
is
of
dulled
fruity
malts
a
slight
dusty
edge
of
bread
yeast
and
toasted
crusts
with
a
pinch
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
thick
and
chewy
lots
of
malted
sweetness
with
a
nice
toasty
ring
to
its
middle
smooth
sweetly
bready
and
delightful
the
sweetness
of
dulled
fruityness
and
bread
continues
to
surge
for
a
good
long
while
after
each
sip
hops
are
very
tiny
with
some
floral
and
grass
tinges
just
before
the
finish
feel
is
quite
thick
and
malt
laden
with
stodgyness
sweetly
lingering
to
the
point
of
almost
cloying
a
very
nice
maibock
quite
thick
in
its
character
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
but
the
overall
thickness
seemed
to
draw
out
its
full
potential
in
regards
to
it
becoming
a
solid
sessionable
brew
clear
golden
tan
in
color
14
of
white
foam
subsides
rather
quickly
and
is
gone
for
good
big
malty
aroma
that
protrays
a
complex
fruitiness
well
carbonated
quite
refreshing
while
still
remaining
somewhat
full
and
chewy
sweet
passionfruit
flavors
and
a
touch
of
graininess
signature
noble
german
hop
flavor
at
the
end
keeps
this
beer
in
balance
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
i
dont
see
this
around
too
much
but
i
would
grab
one
when
i
could
good
stuff
very
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
nicely
hallertauy
and
pretty
alcoholic
the
flavour
mainly
consists
of
bad
vodka
which
is
joined
by
pepper
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
dry
herbal
finish
again
dominated
by
the
vodka
it
must
only
be
6
57
or
something
but
it
tastes
as
alcoholic
as
eku28
not
that
i
mind
that
too
much
theres
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
its
kind
of
thin
and
edgy
like
its
hop
extract
rather
than
whole
hops
i
like
the
normal
bock
better
thats
got
a
bit
more
malt
guts
i
had
four
of
these
at
anam
cara
this
past
saturday
which
means
one
thing
to
me
at
least
this
beer
was
in
perfect
shape
and
the
drinkability
kicked
ass
all
pours
were
clear
clear
golden
small
white
head
went
away
pretty
quickly
aroma
came
across
as
slightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
fresh
grain
mouthfeel
is
properly
carbonated
and
medium
body
is
very
pleasant
taste
is
slightly
sweet
from
the
malt
you
get
some
hoppiness
in
the
finish
if
i
didnt
know
i
would
have
sworn
i
was
drinking
them
in
dland
thats
how
tasty
this
was
good
stuff
the
beer
pours
from
the
tap
a
distinctly
clear
and
golden
yellow
color
with
a
hefty
brilliant
white
and
creamy
head
the
lace
a
filmy
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nose
is
citrus
crisp
and
malt
sweet
pleasingly
fresh
and
a
real
treat
start
is
nicely
malted
and
lightly
sweet
the
top
is
moderate
in
body
finish
is
masterfully
hopped
the
carbonation
brisk
and
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
a
fine
drinking
beer
and
one
ive
never
seen
around
these
parts
a
good
drinkable
pint
that
went
well
with
my
bavarian
sausage
platter
a
wonderful
beer
nicely
hopped
for
aroma
and
bitterness
which
were
perfectly
balanced
to
match
the
nics
dry
crisp
taste
the
taste
was
slightly
spicely
and
bitter
leaving
the
mouth
dry
it
had
a
nice
crisp
and
dry
taste
that
which
is
what
you
expected
from
looking
at
this
nice
copper
clear
beer
a
good
amount
of
head
which
retained
throughout
overall
a
great
light
lager
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
mai
bock
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
there
is
no
noticeable
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonated
for
my
tastes
the
flavor
is
watery
with
light
yeast
and
fruit
no
hop
presence
not
much
presence
at
all
i
found
this
one
disappointing
was
poured
with
creamy
white
foaming
head
that
pairs
nicely
with
th
vibrant
golden
hue
of
the
beer
served
up
in
the
official
spaten
glass
at
the
sharp
edge
the
aroma
consists
of
malt
sweetness
laced
with
the
european
hops
providing
a
mildly
floral
hop
aroma
this
is
a
great
crisp
lager
that
has
fruit
tones
of
sweetness
along
with
balanced
bitterness
to
form
a
really
refreshing
lager
the
maibock
form
of
spaten
comes
with
a
decent
kick
of
alchol
in
the
flavor
a
very
drinkable
classic
that
was
great
for
a
hot
sunny
day
like
yesterday
a
big
solid
malt
flavor
dominates
this
one
it
is
blended
well
with
a
mix
of
fruits
orange
being
the
most
noticable
crisp
carbonation
starts
you
out
and
it
then
smoothes
to
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
have
a
few
at
a
sitting
not
a
beer
i
would
like
to
miss
out
on
prost
medium
copper
body
with
amber
highlights
served
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
showed
very
good
retention
very
fruity
aroma
with
a
slight
alcohol
note
mixed
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
restrained
malt
flavor
has
a
bit
of
a
graininess
to
it
but
shows
good
sweetness
atop
a
creamy
mouthfeel
decent
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
robust
and
full
but
yet
a
bit
harsh
the
slightly
malty
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
refuses
to
go
away
and
the
beer
becomes
a
bit
of
a
nuisance
half
way
through
it
feels
as
though
i
could
go
15
minutes
between
drinks
and
still
feel
like
i
was
drinking
continuously
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
never
seemed
to
finish
in
my
dreams
i
thought
a
neverending
beer
would
be
great
well
its
not
bad
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
frequently
had
this
on
tap
what
a
treat
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
i
have
laid
my
eyes
upon
invitingly
golden
in
color
great
head
smell
of
subdued
malts
tasting
this
on
tap
is
a
treat
smooth
is
an
understatement
great
clean
malt
taste
hops
only
seem
to
be
around
for
balance
as
they
contribute
little
to
the
taste
if
you
look
up
nectar
of
the
gods
in
the
dictionary
surely
a
picture
of
this
will
be
present
serving

a
hazy

but
more
robust

something
similar
to
a
candied

are
in
the
lead
through

with
the
hops
manifesting
nicely
in
the
finish
aftertaste
nicely
bitter
in
the
finish
that
follows
through
increases
in
the
aftertaste
like
mendocino
spring
seasonal
bock
beer
this
brew
is
reminiscent
of
an
english
pale
ale
especially
the
buttery
character
and
also
as
with
mendocino
bock
beer
there
is
a
metallic
note
from
midsip
through
finish
that
intensifies
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
oily
slick
coating
on
the
tongue
overall
a
big
disappointment
for
me
i
was
hoping
for
16oz
of
pure
enjoyment
instead
it
was
drudgery
finishing
this
beer
off
mixed
six
from
plantation
total
wine
o
sprechers
mai
bock
is
perfectly
suited
for
a
wisconsin
spring
that
occasionally
spikes
with
warmth
but
still
drops
to
chilling
temperatures
its
smooth
body
balances
between
light
and
refreshing
and
fuller
and
sustaining
as
the
malt
touches
on
caramel
sweetness
and
freshly
baked
bread
with
a
dry
finish
and
clean
drinkability
overall
its
a
wellbalanced
maibock
and
an
enjoyable
brew
o
this
isnt
as
smooth
as
some
maibocks
to
be
had
being
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
mild
astringency
from
the
dryness
but
the
malty
goodness
of
the
beer
makes
this
a
great
drinker
for
anyone
craving
a
maibock

after

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
maibock
very
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
and
great
example
of
the
style
o
very
easy
drinking
maibock
with
no
alcohol
hotness
like
i
usually
get
with
the
higher
end
of
this
style
the
graininess
was
a
bit
astringent
but
i
can
deal
with
it
because
of
the
crispness
and
cooler
temperatures
this
bottle
was
over
a
year
old
so
i
expected
it
to
have
lost
some
flavor
but
it
seems
to
have
endured
pretty
well
and
i
adjusted
my
ratings
upward
to
account
for
the
knowledge
that
it
was
over
a
year
old
it
poured
up
a
deep
golden
color
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
was
pears
and
floral
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
average
taste
was
a
surprise
to
me
the
front
end
was
very
sweet
with
a
honey
like
flavor
and
the
finish
had
a
respectable
hoppy
bite
which
was
well
balanced
id
love
to
get
a
newer
bottle
of
this
because
even
being
old
it
was
a
winner
i
found
it
good
enough
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
another
4
pack
up
for
a
warm
spring
or
june
day
good
stuff
if
youre
down
at
lake
michigan
or
playing
volleyball
at
summerfest
overall
a
very
well
constructed
spring
lager
recommended
mouthfeel
like
every
other
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
its
full
creamy
but
this
also
has
a
little
touch
of
soapiness
m
heavier
side
of
medium
thickness
somewhat
lighter
in
carbonation
than
i
would
have
preferred
poured
from
a
brown
16
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
biscuts
and
malts
taste
is
somewhat
milder
malts
biscuts
light
hops
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
another
solid
effort
from
sprecher
d
good
beer
though
i
wish
i
had
had
it
fresher
i
no
doubt
would
have
scored
it
higher
if
so
ogood
beer
that
is
very
well
made
bottle
from
southland
beverage
aged
over

not
what
i
expected
based
n
my
limited
exposure
to
this
style
but
good
drinkability
perceived
ibu
is
not
high
here
dvery
easy
drinking
and
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
a
very
approachable
beer
yet
deep
in
its
flavor
profile
pours
a
very
clear
dark
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
only
a
spot
or
two
of

collar
throughout
the
nose

a
bit
of
light
bready

a
touch
of

flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
lot
of
bread
and
mild
grain
slight
floral
hops
leading
to
a
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
nutty
character

smooth

a
beautiful
clear

the
scent
of
wheats
and
sweet
carmel
malts
taste
is
that
of
mostly
malts
with
slight
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
rather
mild
in
comparison
to
other
mai
bocks
ive
had
slight
bit
of
a
dry
after

still
rather
well
made

hoppy

solid
a
rather
nice
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
beer
was
good
and
great
presentation
they
will
give
you
samples
of
45
oz
on
taps
and
this
one
hit
well
so
i
had
a
couple
sorry
i
dont
have
the
astmd
at
this
time
since
im
reviewing
well
after
id
serve
it
to
friends
as
another
beer
to
have
on
hand
but
would
not
buy
again
for
myself
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
has
some
fresh
baked
bread
notes
upfront
along
with
hay
green
apple
toffee
herbal
hops
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
with
fresh
bread
and
hay
upfront
along
with
green
apple
toffee
turbinado
sugar
herbal
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
ok
a
decent
maibock
from
sprecher
this
one
is
a
bit
out
of
season
and
im
sure
its
better
when
fresh
d
this
could
be
a
sessionable
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
certainly
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
this
is
a
nice
lager
a
beer
with
some
good
flavor
at
a
decnt
price
that
goes
down
well
enough
in
the
summer
to
one
of
those
fall
back
brews
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
a
clear
bright
amber
color
with
a
splotchy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
apple
cider
cinnamon
and
caramel
and
a
bit
floral
perfume
a
little
skunky
the
flavor
brings
light
malty
apple
rice
and
brown
bread
its
spritzy
and
mediumlight
bodied
pretty
drinkable
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
mixed
in
with
the
sour
malt
almost
a
vague
brandy
sort
of
hint
going
on
its
also
got
some
dry
grass
hop
notable
at
the
finish
its
okay
worth
a
try
for
the
style
but
not
anything
ill
remember
pours
dark
amber
with
a
good
head
strong
aroma
floral
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
flavor
is
tilted
towards
the
spices
with
a
good
mouthfeel
im
not
too
big
on
this
type
of
beer
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
but
i
would
definitely
get
a
pint
if
i
saw
it
in
a
bar
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
1
12
finger
off
white
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
leaving
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
some
floral
hops
along
with
some
caramel
malts
behind
a
little
spicy
hop
notes
the
taste
is
quite
malty
with
a
little
hops
fighting
through
this
is
a
little
heavier
than
i
anticipated
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
hoped
leaning
towards
the
malty
side
of
things
an
alright
brew
but
better
bocks
out
there
pours
dark
golden
heavy
carbonation
real
nice
lacing
on
this
no
real
head
to
speak
of
this
has
a
really
malty
scent
almost
sickly
sweet
smell
to
it
not
really
my
thing
i
always
thought
i
really
liked
mai
bocks
but
i
think
its
the
season
i
like
more
than
the
beer
way
too
sweet
for
me
and
no
hop
taste
to
speak
of
its
not
sprechers
fault
just
more
my
evolving
tastes
in
what
i
enjoy
definitely
tastes
better
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
special
its
a
little
heavy
6
abv
but
feels
like
it
has
a
little
more
kick
to
it
definitely
high
drinkability
but
not
for
me
split
a
sixer
with
a
friend
and
move
to
something
else
although
i
will
say
i
have
friends
that
will
suck
this
stuff
down
all
day
long
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
little
hoppier
than
one
expects
from
a
bock
but
not
unenjoyably
so
with
a
6
abv
im
surprised
that
the
scent
and
taste
of
alcohol
isnt
as
noticeable
as
it
is
i
wouldnt
pass
one
up
if
offered
to
me
d
not
that
desirable
alright
but
not
that
great
of
flavour
or
drinkability
purchased
from
the
sprecher
brewery
giftshop
in
glendale
wi
pours
a
bright
golden
body
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
cap
aroma
of
fruity
hops
and
sweet
toasted
malts
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
not
overly
sweet
this
beer
had
a
nice
lingering
hop
finish
and
a
subtle
dryness
great
drinkability
id
get
this
again
d
despite
all
its
good
and
unique
flavors
this
beer
really
fills
you
up
with
its
sweet
malts
i
also
think
this
is
getting
past
its
prime
since
i
remember
this
being
amazing
right
when
it
came
out
in
spring
nice
drinkability
balanced
and
flavorful
though
this
beer
feels
bigger
than
it
is
it
has
that
meal
feel
to
it
not
very
carbonated
the
label
indicated
that
it
was
dry
hopped
the
initial
taste
struck
me
as
a
bit
sweeta
bit
surprising
but
enjoyable
later
the
floral
hops
became
more
pronounced
a
wellbalanced
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
beer
appropriate
for
a
beautiful
but
cool
may
day
this
bock
is
a
nice
sweet
treat
when
i
poured
it
it
formed
an
alright
head
but
didnt
stick
around
very
long
very
clear
copper
color
grassy
and
flowery
tastes
very
obviously
from
the
dry
hopping
as
they
note
on
the
bottle
its
a
smooth
crisp
bock
very
light
and
kind
of
a
nice
spring
treat
though
i
usually
like
stonger
more
robust
bocks
personally
this
is
very
drinkable
and
being
a
sprecher
im
really
not
that
suprised
that
it
tasted
that
good
pours
a
deep
golden
clear
color
with
a
white
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
is
of
biscuity
malts
and
a
bit
stale
flavor
is
way
off
wet
paper
metallic
and
a
long
lasting
bitterness
no
solid
malt
complexity
medlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
no
bueno
and
comes
from
a
brewery
that
can
produce
a
high
quality
lager
i
really
appreciate
this
style
of
beer
and
love
the
vibrant
rich
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
but
this
leaves
me
plain
disapointed
my
expectations
where
met
drinks
easy
enough
not
super
exciting
as
maibocks
go
probably
better
fresh
d
well
done
sprecher
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
that
can
hang
with
the
krauts
d
this
beer
has
soft
but
bland
flavors
with
no
real
fresh
or
clean
malt
qualities
and
no
much
hop
note
at
all
this
beer
was
not
offensive
or
bad
tasting
just
very
muted
pours
a
clear
slightly
reddishbrown
w
a
thin
creamy
white
head
which
settles
into
a
ring
of
lace
that
completely
coats
my
pilsn
glass
not
a
strong
smell
at
all
steely
grain
and
hints
of

hops
and
caramel

is
similar
only
a
bit
stronger
w
more

deeper

an
enjoyable
brew
but
not
my
favorite
sprecher
beer
i
know
this
beer
is
out
of
season
but
i
had
to
try
it
since
my
sainted
mother
brought
it
back
form
packer
land
for
me
looks
very
nice
coming
out
of
the
bottle
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
big
white
head
the
smell
is
also
very
appealing
with
malt
and
citrus
hop
tones
tastes
very
malty
and
sweet
i
also
notice
some
fruity
characteristics
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
too
sweet
and
i
would
like
to
have
some
more
hop
notes
but
im
a
hop
head
so
whatever
d
a
nice
and
subtle
balanced
beer
im
very
impressed
with
this
brewery
from
what
ive
had
from
them
very
solid
and
drinkable
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
really
nice
mai
bock
the
flavors
arent
quite
the
same
as
the
spaten
or
some
of
the
other
traditional
mai
bocks
but
its
still
within
the
style
it
starts
with
pale
malts
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
then
expands
into
fruit
flavors
like
apple
and
sweet
cherry
with
a
slight
licorice
tang
the
appearance
is
nice
and
its
quite
drinkable
i
can
see
why
this
is
an
award
winner
appearance
of
this
beer
is
quite
good
it
is
a
sparkling
and
clear
copper
color
with
good
head
formation
and
retention
aroma
is
distinctly
coppery
more
metallic
than
it
is
malty
and
flavor
is
the
same
i
get
maltiness
up
front
but
i
get
a
distingly
disturbing
copper
taste
at
the
finish
that
lingers
in
my
mouth
a
long
long
while
not
so
good
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
i
cant
say
i
recommend
this
beer
this
is
smooth
for
a
bock
and
drinkable
definitely
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
though
not
a
bad
brew
sprecher
does
it
up
by
serving
a
full
pint
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
its
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
capital
is
my
goto
maibock
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
from
sprecher
ive
enjoyed
all
their
offerings
ive
sampled
in
the
past
i
dont
believe
they
get
the
credit
they
deserve

brilliant
the
nose
is
very
expressive
with
plenty
of
piney
hops
light
spice
clove
and
honeydew
melon
bright
crisp
and
mildly
sweet
on
the
first
sip
the
dry
hopping
does
seem
to
be
evident
with
the
hops
full
of
spicy
perfumey
lupulin
charm
malt
profile
is
easygoing
yet
equally
as
chatty
as
the
hops
with
a
round
feel
biscuity
notes
light
caramel
and
overall
notquite
sweet
fairly
mild
bitterness
although
the
character
of
the
hop
really
stays
with
you
more
than
the
bitterness
itself
notes
of
fruit
are
light
but
pleasant
with
citrus
grapefruit
golden
apple
and
melon
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
and
yeah
i
can
even
taste
the
hops
when
i
burp
medium
bodied
but
rather
light
on
the
palate
altogether
readily
sessionable
this
is
a
fresh
batch
and
it
really
comes
across
this
way
by
way
of
its
taste
and
crisp
expressive
hop
qualities
im
happy
to
see
sprecher
beers
back
in
the
twin
cities
area
im
usually
pleasantly
surprised
by
sprecher
and
mai
bock
is
no
exception
in
fact
id
say
that
its
neck
and
neck
with
capital
maibock
for
instate
honors
and
is
probably
the
superior
beer
even
if
you
arent
thrilled
with
the
stylelike
methis
one
is
definitely
worth
a
purchase
a
deep
clear
gold
brew
smells
like
delicious
green
apple
slices
and
freshly
sickled
grains
nicely
layered
smells
taste
is
malts
and
sour
apple
with
a
mildly
sweet
aftertaste
dotted
with
cherries
while
it
has
a
lot
of
sweet
flavors
none
of
them
are
overwhelming
and
the
little
bits
of
sourness
and
malts
help
to
balance
things
nice
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
mai
bock
drinkability
good
rendition
of
the
style
with
nice
bock
malts
though
the
hops
are
a
little
out
of
place
and
might
seem
distracting
to
some
nonetheless
i
didnt
mind
them
too
much
and
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
found
it
on
tap
or
available
in
singles
ive
grown
tired
of
the
big
boozey
heavily
carbonated
mai
bocks
that
get
thrown
around
this
time
of
year
this
one
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
its
infinitely
more
drinkable
with
better
hopping
than
most
of
the
competition
purchased
at
the
brewery
in
a
16
oz
bottle
the
pour
is
of
a
deep
copper
almost
amber
with
tone
reminiscent
of
honey
this
is
capped
off
by
a
nice
tight
although
small
head
nose
is
small
for
style
what
i
was
expecting
was
not
there
but
there
was
a
tracer
of
that
sweet
malty
honey
flavor
was
definitely
malty
and
nice
and
full
bodied
the
finish
was
surprisingly
crisp
for
the
style
and
left
very
little
aftertaste
this
beer
definitely
is
a
warmer
but
quite
drinkable
see
you
next
year
drinkabilty
good
overall
a
well
crafted
and
immensely
enjoyable
brew
from
a
great
brewery
perhaps
a
tad
bit
hoppier
than
most
maibocks
but
it
is
just
right
in
my
opinion
this
goes
so
well
with
burgers
and
brats
it
is
hard
to
even
eat
them
without
it
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
have
access
to
some
that
is
fresh
sprechers
maibock
is
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
maibock
style
assertive
and
true
to
form
pous
a
clear
golden
copper
with
a
good
head
shrinking
to
a
thin
white
film
aroma
is
pleasant
if
not
all
that
assertive
floral
hops
and
bready
malts
mainly
pretty
stock
taste
has
that
same
bready
malts
with
the
floral
hops
breaking
through
in
the
middle
with
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
decent
carbonation
a
good
session
beer
perhaps
though
not
the
first
maibock
id
grab
off
the
shelf
but
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
since
i
had
only
tried
one
beer
of
this
style
and
nothing
from
this
company
it
was
a
good
beer
but
it
tasted
more
like
the
one
english
pale
ale
that
ive
had
rather
than
the
other
maibockhelles
bock
that
i
had
the
only
two
minor
complaints
that
i
have
with
it
is
that
its
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
bit
too
filling
d
very
easy
drinking
a
nice
hoppy
maibock
869
picked
it
up
while
getting
something
else
at
the
liquor
store
so
its
one
more
for
the
list
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
handed
to
me
at
a
party
dear
sprecher
sorry
for
the
low
scores
this
beer
is
judged
to
style
not
to
the
taste
theres
very
little
bock
character
in
this
beer
and
its
waaay
too
hoppy
create
a
new
category
say
india
helles
bock
and
this
beer
fits
right
in
kudos
to
you
for
pushing
the
limits
this
offering
makes
me
eager
to
try
other
beers

adding
tot
he
fruitiness
of
this

taste
is
sweet
and
malty
but
lacks
the
crispness
of
most
mbs
ive
had
very
malt
dominated
with
the
hops
acting
in
a
secondary
role
as
they
should
not
heavy
carbonation
fairly
smooth

not
bad
but
not
a

maibock
reviewing

good
taste
is
similar
but
less
offensive
slight
lingering
bitterness
does
have
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
which
would
make
it
easy
to
drink
if
i
cared
for
the
smell
at
all
a
fairly
well
balanced
and
hefty
maibock
that
has
a

this

was
2
50
for
mixed
four
pack
i
couldnt
pass
it
up
had
no
idea
what
this
was
going
to
be
like
and
its
pretty
decent
pours
an
extremely
clean
and
clear
looking
light
straw
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lasts
about
halfway
down
the
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
grain
nutty
taste
as
well
as
some
buttery
biscuity
characters
not
much
hop
bitterness
to
this
at
all
but
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
purpose
of
this
beer
really
nice
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
super
easy
to
put
back
a
solid
maibock
solid
clear
coppper
color
with
a
solid
white
head
on
top
which
left
lace
on
the
way
down
aroma
of
vienna
munich
and
caramel
malts
compete
with
floral
to
spicey
hops
and
spicey
yeast
for
aroma
dominance
malt
flavor
is
clean
and
smooth
with
solid
bitterness
and
a
refreshing
yeast
finish
the
beer
has
a
solid
body
yet
isnt
so
heavy
that
you
cant
enjoy
a
few
i
used
to
fly
to
milwaukee
about
once
every
week
or
two
for
business
on
the
return
i
new
i
could
always
count
on
one
of
these
beers
in
the
main
bar
at
the
center
of
the
terminal
two
if
i
had
a
delay
this
beer
nursed
me
through
many
a
thunder
or
snow
storm
slightly
hazy
gold
to
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
has
bread
dough
up
front
with
caramel
and
toffee
following
the
finish
of
the
nose
has
a
mild
pineapple
quality
the
taste
has
wonderful
full
malt
character
loads
of
caramel
and
toffee
balanced
nicely
by
a
pleasant
bitterness
there
is
a
citrus
character
that
finally
shows
on
a
long
finish
full
slightly
slick
mouth
feel
and
no
alcohol
heat
ad
to
a
high
drinakbility
im
not
fluent
in
the
mai
bock
category
i
suggest
to
everybody
to
give
this
a
try
just
to
experience
the
interesting
flavors
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
respectible
sized
head
the
nose
on
this
one
is
great
definitely
hoppier
than
your
average
maibock
this
one
got
a
lot
of
dryhopping
done
to
it
i
pick
up
some
citrusy
pac
nw
hops
in
the
nose
along
with
a
slight
fruitty
sweetness
the
taste
is
first
slightly
sweet
with
a
warming
alcohol
presence
spicy
hops
hit
near
the
end
and
make
sure
they
are
known
a
yeastlike
frutiness
finishes
this
one
off
quite
the
one
off
maibock
but
not
bad
at
all
maibocks
often
seem
bland
compared
to
bocks
or
doppelbocks
but
this
beer
from
sprecher
lacks
any
interesting
character
its
clean
at
least
i
would
buy
again
in
a
heartbeat
good
value
for
the
quality
7
for
4
pints
it
is
a
drinkable
maibock
but
not
one
that
i
would
recommend
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
to
pass
on
faint
amber
in
hue
extremely
foamy
white
head
has
somewhat
of
a
citrus
and
floral
aroma
medium
bodied
a
bit
slick
and
smooth
a
bit
buttery
and
spicy
off
the
beaten

for
a

a
bit
spicy
pepper
and

noticed
in
the
middle
of
this
fine
beverage
some
alcohol
presence
is
definitely
noted
slick
spicy
and
tasty
should
please
the
general
ba
population
try
one
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
light
beige
head
which
hung
around
for
awhile
and
provided
good
lacing
clear
dark
golden
shade
to
the
brew
with
a
light
yeasty
aroma
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
me
with
the
malt
nice
and
upfront
but
the
hops
a
bit
strong
that
distacted
my
taste
buds
at
the
end
of
the
experience
still
nothing
to
sneeze
at
but
after
my
last
black
bavarian
i
have
begun
to
expect
greatness
from
sprecher
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
a
downer
due
to
previously
mentioned
bitterness
but
drinkability
is
quite
good
could
see
them
going
down
well
on
a
nice
spring
day
or
a
day
like
today
cloudy
and
rainy

the
hoppiest

i
have
had
and
i
really
like
it
nice
blondish
amber
colored
malt
with
an
offwhite
head
that
foams
up
quite
nicely
complex
aromas
sets
this
beer
apart
from
others
of
its
style
every
time
i
took
a
whiff
i
could
pick
up
different
aromas
like
oatmeal
raisins
brown
sugar
and
flowery
earthy
hops
no
doubt
a
result
of
dryhopping
nice
and
sweet
upfront
with
caramel
flavors
cleansing
middle
and
a
very
prolonged
bitterness
at
the
end
alcohol
flavors
were
noticeable
but
mixed
well
with
the
malt
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
easily
drinkable
and
pairs
well
with
a
nutty
cigar
the
best
damn
us
maibock
ive
had
yet
this
brewery
is
growing
on
me
as
an
asided
my
late
grandfather
told
me
that
sprechers
mai
bock
reminded
him
of
how
pabst
tasted
back
in
the
1940s
and
50s
though
that
was
interesting
this
maibock
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
few
trails
of
a
lace
remain
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
an
upfront
sweetness
provided
by
loads
of
malts
in
addition
to
a
mildly
earthy
and
herbal
hoppiness
smells
inviting
and
the
taste
confirms
a
big
fruity
sweetness
becomes
evident
honey
tropical
fruit
caramel
and
an
herbal
hop
finish
are
most
notable
in
the
taste
department
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
not
overly
fizzy
this
is
satisfying
and
quite
drinkable
an
authentic
maibock
and
a
job
well
done
by
sprecher
talk
about
bitter
tasting
wow
this
beer
poured
a
medium
sized
white
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
there
was
very
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
beer
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
amber
with
a
spicy
nose
there
was
a
bitter
taste
that
lingered
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
off
white
bubbles
and
a
transparent
light
amber
body
it
has
a
spicy
aroma
with
a
bitter
initial
taste
of
spiced
hops
and
a
lingering
bitter
after
taste
it
has
a
fair
lacing
it
tastes
like
it
has
more
than
a
6
abv
it
leaves
a
lingering
tingly
mouth
feel
i
didnt
care
much
for
the
bitterness
in
this
maibock
it
seems
more
like
an
esb
than
a
bock
sprecher
maibock
absolutely
clear
amber
colored
brew
from
our
friends
up
in
milwaukee
very
thick
off
white
head
that
lasts
very
rich
aroma
noticeable
from
a
few
feet
away
after
opening
up
the
bottle
clean
aroma
with
a
trace
of
the
malts
enlivening
it
but
with
a
definite
whiff
of
the
hops
as
well
very
nice
taste
very
light
bodied
the
predominate
tastes
are
the
malts
but
this
maibock
has
a
nice
but
unusual
hop
kick
toward
the
end
actually
quite
nice
and
refreshing
well
made
beer
look
for
it
straight
amber
color
largebubbled
head
of
almost
14
inch
to
start
but
one
that
fades
to
a
trace
in
half
a
minute
whew
a
hoppy
and
spicy
cinnamon
aroma
really
hops
immediately
balance
the
good
malt
early
and
dominate
the
finish
and
aftertaste
as
well
the
predominant
sweet
counterpoint
is
a
sense
of
buttered
toast
with
confectioners
sugar
quite
nice
now
this
is
one
spicy
meatball
of
a
maibock
a
refreshing
breakout
from
the
malty
bocks
and
doppelbocks
of
winterearly
spring
sassy
but
with
enough
good
malt
backup
to
balance
the
brew
bring
on
the
summer
this
one
pleasantly
surprised
me
after
consuming
primarily
winter
warmers
stouts
barley
wines
and
strong
ales
all
winter
i
could
almost
taste
the
upcoming
spring
in

refreshing

it
the

play
heavily
into
the
overall
enjoyment
just
enough
without
being
too

tends
to
be
dry
with
a

beer
the
head
on
this
one
is
shallow
and
quickly
fades
aroma
is
very

theres
a
subtle
maltiness
underneath
that
identifies
the
beer
as
a
bock
fortaste
is
sweet
and
malty
and
overall
its
well
balanced
with

the
brew
is
a

than
i
expected
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
experience
all
in
all
its
good
certainly
better
than

but
not
outstanding
a
beer
that
could
be
consumed
en

crisp

somewhat

at
the

this
is
probably
the

ive
had
its

although
maybe
not
true
to
form
after
cutting
through
some
of
the

notes
there
is
some
substance
here
there
is
a
definite

a
very
unique
maibock
that
in
my
opinion
tasted
even
better
on
the
finish
im
a
bit
of
a
hophead
true
bock
enthusiasts
may
not
look
as
fondly
on
this
beer
as
i
do
overall
it
is
better
than
i
anticipated
but
not
something
id
be
likely
to
try
again
overall
a
decent
maibock
nothing
too
exceptional
but
a
nice
go
to
when
looking
for
something
malty
and
chewy
i
popped
the
cap
and
before
i
could
make
the
pour
i
had
a
small
cap
of
head
sneaking
its
way
up
through
the
neck
of
the
bottle
being
that
it
was
that
carbonated
i
employed
a
more
gentle
pour
than
i
might
have
otherwise
the
dense
twofinger
cap
of
french
vanillacolored
head
looked
like
the
top
of
an
ice
cream
float
perfect
for
the
approach
of
summer
color
was
an
ohsoslightly
hazy
goldenyellow
nose
smelled
strongly
of
saaz
hops
kind
of
skunky
catty
you
get
the
idea
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
viscous
and
the
taste
of
the
hops
was
a
off
and
b
much
too
heavy
for
the
style
finish
retained
a
sharpness
from
the
hops
that
rendered
it
fairly
unpleasant
in
total
another
swing
and
a
miss
for
this
brewery
i
am
going
to
prefice
that
i
am
having
this
out
in
the
shed
with
a
pipe
of
massanutten
so
now
down
to
business
i
enjoyed
the
initial
sensation
of
taste
with
the
black
keys
killing
it
to
little
black
submarines
it
was
refreshing
for
a
7
5
the
nose
was
lacking
for
me
but
the
back
door
caused
the
score
with
a
bit
of
floyd
playing
i
liked
its
finish
cheers
if
only
the
beer
could
taste
like
the
smell
and
late
finish
it
smelled
sweet
and
balanced
with
a
nice
noble
hop
presence
but
in
all
actuality
its
just
a
jumbled
mess
really
surprised
to
see
the
low
ratings
for
this
beer
really
a
strong
showing
for
an
american
maibock
to
date
atwater
maibock
is
my
favorite
atwater
brew
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
dirty
orange
in
color
with
yellowish
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
very
murky
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
reduced
to
a
solid
white
cap
toasted
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
with
light
earthy
hop
and
buttery
notes
medium
bodied
a
creamy
feel
through
the
middle
with
rich
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
toasted
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
up
front
bitter
flavors
build
through
the
middle
to
the
end
but
the
hop
flavor
lacks
character
finishes
clean
and
semidry
with
a
lingering
dull
bitterness
picked
up
a
six
pack
on
sale
for

99
poured
into
a
brit
style
pint
glass
bottled
in
march
2012
bright
yellow
orange
color
good
lacing
on
the
glass
clear
body
with
good
carbonation
smell
had
a
hint
of
grapefruit
and
musty
hay
taste
was
good
as
i
liked
the
really
malty
flavor
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
sticky
side
though
i
found
this
maibock
to
be
a
pretty
smooth
beer
to
drink
considering
the
well
hidden
abv
not
a
bad
find
for
the
price
and
with
that
strength
it
held
up
pretty
well
over
the
course
of
spring
into
summer
d
this
isnt
very
good
even
for
a
style
that
im
lukewarm
about
to
begin
with
the
main
redeeming
element
is
the
wellhidden
alcohol
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
this
is
a
style
i
like
quite
a
bit
and
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
out
also
the
metallic
aspect
really
knocks
it
down
a
notch
o
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
nose
teases
you
about
a
sweetness
that
never
really
shows
def
interesting
with
the
breadiness
though
i
still
cant
place
it
other
then
the
two
pastries
i
mentioned
above
curious
what
other
thought
of
this
also
very
interested
in
trying
some
other
maibocks
to
compare
will
def
keep
an
eye
open
from
now
on
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
pretty
surprised
with
this
beer
and
i
ended
up
really
liking
it
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
damn
good
maibock
i
dont
have
any
experience
with
this
style
but
i
really
like
the
fact
that
it
is
suppose
to
be
a
drinkable
spring
beer
flavorful
but
light
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
during
the
day
while
chilling
outside
this
beer
has
inspired
me
to
seek
out
more
of
this
style
and
try
some
traditional
maibocks
this
beer
was
super
drinkable
it
never
lasts
long
in
my
glass
and
goes
great
with
some
grilling
outside
and
it
paired
great
with
some
beer
brats
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
throughout
the
day
if
i
wanted
to
as
far
as
bocks
go
i
dont
think
they
get
much
more
drinkable
then
this
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
everything
this
beer
was
firing
on
all
cylinders
and
i
thought
every
aspect
was
well
done
there
wasnt
anything
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
i
couldnt
find
anything
at
all
that
was
wrong
with
it
which
isnt
all
that
common
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
and
have
already
got
another
six
pack
i
think
everyone
should
give
this
beer
a
try
even
my
mom
liked
it
and
that
doesnt
happen
often
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
atwater
has
a
way
of
disappointing
me
a
couple
times
in
a
row
and
just
when
i
start
to
lower
my
expectations
they
come
out
of
nowhere
with
an
unexpectedly
great
beer
and
that
was
the
case
with
this
beer
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
it
good
job
guys
this
may
be
my
choice
beverage
of
the
spring
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
maibock
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
atwater
all
in
all
a
great
beer
poured
one
and
a
half
bottles
into
a
half
liter
stein
with
a
full
goldenbrass
color
with
a
blooming
one
and
a
half
finger
white
head
atop
toasted
grain
sweetish
alcohol
in
the
nosea
faint
iron
note
as
well
not
as
full
and
sweet
as
alot
of
maibocks
but
its
got
a
nice
firm
toastiness
and
a
tinge
of
aniseit
misses
on
some
character
traits
but
hits
on
a
few
others
not
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
in
the
mouthfeel
but
i
think
its
a
little
better
than
the
ratings
may
suggestnot
top
tier
but
ok
overall
looking
over
the
reviews
this
beer
may
have
improved
over
the
last
few
years
but
it
is
still
not
anywhere
near
the
top
of
list
for
the
style
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
considerable
lacing
throughout
smell
is
full
of
malts
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
also
malty
sweet
some
hops
are
present
good
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
balance
that
is
malt
centric
and
showed
no
signs
of
the
7
5
abv
overall
a
good
beer
d
pretty
high
especially
for
7
abv
worth
a
try
poured
decently
from
the
tap
not
much
head
so
it
just
looks
like
a
fuller
glass
yay
golden
in
color
cloudy
in
transparency
no
smell
that
i
can
detect
tastes
sweet
and
bready
maybe
yeasty
with
a
decent
feel
to
it
smooth
and
easy
a
carbonation
level
to
my
preference
more
moderate
to
low
from
this
experience
i
could
barely
believe
the
abv
on
this
one
because
it
was
a
very
easy
drink
it
seems
a
very
average
beer
but
theres
an
easiness
to
it
thatl
have
me
order
it
again
next
time
i
see
it
or
pick
it
up
if
i
see
it
in
a
bottle
this
beer
is
very
much
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
good
and
would
seek
out
this
maibock
next
year
d
decent
drinkability
it
is
on
the
light
side
so
it
goes
down
easy
but
the
flavor
is
only
interesting
for
one
or
two
beers
after
that
i
would
get
sick
of
it
clear
dark
brass
with
a
fine
tan
head
that
leaves
sliding
lace
on
the
glass
green
apple
skin
and
creamed
corn
in
the
nose
thankfully
this
brew
tastes
way
better
than
it
smells
untoasted
grainy
flavors
with
citric
and
floral
hop
notes
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
relatively
strong
maibock
d
not
terrible
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
drinks
alright
for
the
abv
notes
a
good
strong
malty
lager
with
a
bit
of
spicy
flavor
from
hops
cheers
other
than
that
strange
taste
i
detected
nothing
too
particularly
memorable
about
this
beer
pretty
easy
drinking
and
i
managed
to
enjoy
the
overall
experience
not
sure
that
i
would
purchase
again
notes
from
52407
quite
a
tasty
little
brew
there
are
a
lot
of
very
sweet
fruit
flavors
pears
peaches
apples
and
appricots
very
candied
with
confectionate
sugars
the
nose
suggests
that
this
beer
is
too
sweet
to
enjoy
but
the
delicate
candied
malts
and
fruits
prove
otherwise
the
appearance
worried
me
at
first
with
an
overcarbonated
pour
that
led
me
to
think
that
an
infection
may
have
occured
but
this
was
not
the
case
a
bold
white
looseknit
head
formation
reminded
me
a
bit
of
duvel
but
the
retention
proved
to
be
merely
mortal
the
beer
feels
a
bit
syrupy
sweet
leaving
it
not
well
attenuated
so
the
mouthfeel
gives
up
what
the
rich
flavors
gain
i
get
only
a
subtle
corn
taste
late
that
most
bas
describe
as
dominant
perhaps
the
6
months
age
has
helped
out
finishes
sweet
a
bit
tacky
and
well
fruity
makes
me
wonder
the
temperature
or
yeast
that
they
used
for
fermentation
if
you
like
sweet
lowhopped
ales
this
may
be
up
your
alley
im
flabbergasted
that
atwater
block
continues
to
keep
their
doors
open
maibock
is
my
seventh
brew
from
this
brewery
and
is
the
worst
of
a
very
nasty
lot
what
are
the
odds
that
ive
gotten
ahold
of
seven
seven
bad
bottles
from
three
different
stores
in
two
different
states
at
two
separate
times
since
cold
spring
formerly
gluek
has
improved
some
of
their
products
i
hereby
nominate
these
guys
for
americas
worst
microbrewery
gack
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
with
this
beer
atwater
has
let
me
down
in
the
past
but
this
beer
is
different
its
not
bad
by
any
means
the
golden
color
is
offset
by
the
huge
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
it
took
me
at
least
an
hour
to
drink
this
and
the
head
never
faded
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
but
that
is
subdued
with
time
tropical
fruit
is
on
the
nose
pineapple
and
maybe
some
banana
the
taste
is
harder
to
place
with
nondescript
flavors
that
are
kind
of
mashed
together
but
it
is
distinctly
sweet
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
fine
a
little
syrupy
but
nothing
great
it
took
me
a
while
to
finish
this
one
and
not
because
its
a
sipper
necessarily
the
abv
is
7
5
which
is
big
enough
to
warrant
sipping
but
this
beer
does
not
get
much
better
as
it
warms
a
decent
offering
mild
recommendation
as
maibocks
go
this
is
ok
not
the
best
but
come
on
it
is
not
an
f
you
mn
boys
must
have
had
a
6
pack
that
was
over
exposed
to
light
or
something
i
know
the
atwater
folks
well
and
they
make
decent
beer
not
anything
worthy
of
an
f
golden
body
very
hazy
lots
of
co2
bubbles
apparant
big
frothy
rocky
white
head
all
signs
that
maybe
this
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
chemical
smell
of
sulfur
and
of
an
electrical
fire
awful
aroma
carbonation
is
too
high
the
electrical
fire
aroma
translates
nicely
over
to
the
palate
or
not
nicely
in
this
case
this
beer
is
highly
flawed
this
is
the
first
beer
i
will
actually
pour
down
the
drain
in
years
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
maibock
or
lager
and
tossing
out
the
category
this
just
doesnt
appeal
to
me
there
are
big
elements
of
this
that
i
dont
like
at
all
some
of
it
is
my
fault
with
my
neuroses
and
biases
but
the
majority
of
the
blame
falls
on
the
beer
drinkability
fine
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
drink
to
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
sourness
pours
out
to
a
bright
and
dense
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
goodsized
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
faint
hint
of
marshmallows
coming
to
the
forefront
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
sip
giving
way
to
a
nice
dose
of
hops
on
the
swallow
that
turn
off
that
sweetness
this
tastes
like
a
fully
loaded
lager
i
dig
it
nicely
done
i
would
definately
recommend
this
brew
i
may
have
received
a
bad
bottle
but
the
taste
is
good
i
just
have
to
get
past
the
first
few
sniffs
scott
a
little
sweeter
and
hoppier
than
typical
bocks
lighter
in
color
as
well
its
got
a
fruitylike
aftertaste
this
beer
is
not
as
harsh
or
muddy
as
some
sevenandahalf
percent
alcohol
beers
i
like
it
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
im
going
to
open
another
right
now
and
support
our
struggling
detroit
economy

rough
graininess
that
i
usually
detect
in
atwater
block
bottle
openings
kinda
rough
bitterness
with
leafy
flavors
doesnt
meld
so
well
a
sour
grainy
finish
with
some

carbonation
issues
from
this

i
would
like
drinkability
is
decent
but
by
no
means
as
clean
and
crips
as
a
well
made
maibock
should
be
kinda
disappointing
froma
seasonal
bottled
offering
from
any
micro
drinkabiltiy
is
good
although
its
definately
on
the
sweet
side
a
good
lager
with
lots
of
flavor
good
for
summertime
sweetclean
and
crisp
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
any
time
of
the
year
get
it
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
drinkable
and
flavor
filled
d
nearly
perfect
an
excellent
spring
sipper
ill
most
likely
be
picking
up
a
six
of
this
soon
d
sweet
and
relatively
well
hopped
worth
a
second
chance
but
not
an
impressive
maibock
considering
it
was
not
full
bodied
or
very
flavorful
in
any
respect
on
the
whole
this
is
not
a
great
beer
tartness
is
out
of
place
leading
to
my
feeling
that
this
may
have
been
out
of
date
lack
of
balance
is
also
a
drawback
slight

infection
is
awful
sorry
atwater
but
this
is
the
second
different
beer
ive
had
that
has
been
a
totally
infected
mess
leave
the

spicy

prevelant

bu
hiding
a

malt
note
light
sweet
malt
is
accompanied
by
a
hint
of
champagnelike
esthers
perhaps
this
is
still
a
little
young
it
tastes
slightly
acedylhydelike
hops
are
spicy
and
pleasantly
bitter
lightish
body
pleasantly
active
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
brew
very
drinkable
perhaps
this
needs
handling
differently
or
perhaps
the
bottle
was
off
but
minus
the
champagneacetylhyde
this
would
have
been
spectacular
overall
a
very
nice
helles
bock
i
love
how
the
finish
is
dry
and
everything
leading
up
to
the
finish
is
sweet
and
delicate
quite
a
beautifully
balanced
spoton
domestic
rendition
of
a
hardtonail
style
excellent
for
sure
from
the
bottle
poured
a
honey
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
stay
around
very
long
but
left
some
lacing
aroma
sugar
yeast
light
fruits
like
pears
apples
flavor
almost
a
cotton
candy
type
of
sweetness
malts
wow
is
this
beer
sweet
almost
to
the
point
of
being
too
sweet
ill
be
back
for
this
one
overall
a
decent
maibock
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
from
the
brewery
though
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
dark
amber
color
some
carbonation
with
a
little
fizzy
off
white
foamy
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
mostly
malty
with
some
sweetness
medium
body
overall
this
would
be
a
way
better
brew
if
it
was
not
this
old
some
of
the
sls
suck
when
it
comes
to
getting
in
fresher
brews
because
of
this
you
need
to
look
at
dates
which
i
did
not
do
in
this
case
o
easy
drinking
spring
seasonal
this
ine
can
catch
up
with
you
fast
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
glad
to
try
but
probably
wont
buy
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
drinkability
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
i
feel
like
they
froze
a
decent
lager
and
then
melted
it
in
order
to
concentrate
the
alcohol
ala
an
eisbock
this
was
a
slight
miss
but
i
would
drink
it
again
its
lacking
in
the
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
is
pretty
good
cloyingly
sweet
at
the
start
and
finishes
mildly
hopp
pretty
boring
and
nothing
near
as
good
as
past
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
the
caramel
and
baked
apple
notes
dominated
this
one
there
are
some
faint
hops
for
balance
but
overall
its
sweet
fruity
and
sticky
ill
pass
in
the
future
overall
comes
across
as
messy
too
much
yeast
driven
fruitiness
for
the
style
this
was
a
fairly
nice
maibock
that
certainly
held
up
to
the
style
nicely
the
higher
abv
was
noticeable
but
i
find
that
to
be
nice
in
spring
offerings
not
bad
rjt
enjoyed
this
beer
which
is
something
since
its
a
gordon
biersch
beer
good
beer
for
the
season
o
a
decent
beer
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
a
good
attempt
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
make
a
concerted
attempt
to
try
it
again
i
would
have
liked
just
a
little
bit
more
balancing
bitterness
o
honestly
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
night
out
of
a
few
of
their
offerings
like
another
reviewer
said
goes
great
with
their
garlic
fries
ill
have
to
try
this
from
the
bottle
and
see
how
it
compares
pretty
solid
overall
with
the
exception
of
the
light
mouthfeel
o
ive
had
this
on
tap
first
time
on
the
bottle
much
better
on
tap
this
is
just
overly
sweet
for
a
maibock
not
my
favorite
example
but
i
know
gb
can
do
better
lighter
in
body
than
its
appearance
would
suggest
carbonation
is
nicely
done
very
limited
hop
mouthfeel
from
this
something
very
low
alpha
acid
i
would
expect
sweetness
is
the
predominant
flavor
but
not
candy
like
by
any
means
highly
carbonated
largely
drinkable
but
not
much
defineable
character
beyond
carbonation
and
sweet
not
complex
by
any
means
a
little
bready
downbottle
and
the
smell
turned
for
the
worse
better
when
you
pair
it
with
their
garlic
fries
but
what
isnt
mouthfeel
is
definitely
light
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
overall
not
an
impressive
brew
just
fairly
average
a
decent
summer
beer
and
it
went
well
with
my
meal
but
didnt
make
me
want
to
go
back
for
more
o
this
was
the
worst
beer
i
had
that
nice
i
wont
get
this
one
again
overall
a
decent
maibock
works
well
for
a
seasonal
as
i
will
enjoy
this
sixer
well
enough
but
that
will
do
for
a
while
medium
bodied
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
moderate
finish
i
dont
know
i
dont
really
love
the
beer
its
not
fantastic
and
theres
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
then
again
i
dont
hate
it
either
just
nothing
id
ever
buy
again
distributors
mustve
started
pushing
this
beer
around
here
about
a
year
ago
it
seemed
like
every
bar
or
liquor
store
was
getting
this
stuff
gb
maibock
12ozs
into
pint
pours
deep
golden
almost
copper
with
literally
no
head
whatsoever
smells
really
sweet
with
lots
of
crystal
and
pale
malts
showing
up
no
hops
are
detected
tastes
almost
cloying
and
not
really
pleasurable
to
me
this
beer
somewhat
reminds
me
of
their
blonde
bock
and
im
just
not
a
fan
of
that
one
either
i
wouldnt
mind
using
this
in
a
marinade
or
something
similar
but
i
just
cant
see
drinking
another
in
the
near
future
overall
i
would
recommend
someone
thats
into
really
sweet
offerings
to
sample
this
beer
its
worth
a
try
but
its
just
not
for
me
i
guess
cheers
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
1
finger
off
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
and
nearly
no
cap
once
settled
was
over
poured
and
served
said
booyah
when
slamming
it
onto
my
coaster
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
full
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
the
taste
was
along
those
lines
very
sweet
nutty
malts
and
a
strong
plum
and
raisin
flavor
not
much
hop
noticed
in
this
brew
the
carbonation
was
moderate
and
there
was
a
little
notice
of
the
alcohol
warmth
after
about
half
the
brew
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
after
getting
the
tab
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
price
booyah
the
mouthfeel
is
just
alright
its
highly
carbonated
and
seems
fullbodied
but
somehow
just
washes
right
down
the
drinkability
is
ok
it
would
drink
a
lot
more
easily
if
it
werent
so
damned
sweet
another
letdown
from
gordon
biersch
i
find
that
everything
they
do
is
just
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
mean
this
is
a
decently
constructed
beer
o
overall
not
bad
but
not
not
great
either
this
one
is
right
in
the
middle
a
pretty
average
beer
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
but
not
something
i
would
turn
down
either
drinkability
despite
the
bitterness
at
the
end
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
worth
a
sixpack
clear
medium
amber
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
pleasant
and
sweetsmelling
with
caramel
malt
and
some
plumlike
fruitiness
flavor
is
caramel
malt
and
pale
malt
along
with
slight
dark
fruit
notes
very
mild
bittering
hops
come
through
on
the
finish
decent
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
rather
flat
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
well
this
is
all
right
slight
shortcomings
on
the
palate
and
appearance
are
made
up
for
by
pretty
good
aroma
and
flavor
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
quickly
devolves
to
a
sparse
coating
the
beer
smells
very
malty
with
sweet
apples
notes
rising
bread
and
hints
of
oxidation
like
turn
wine
or
bruised
fruit
not
good
the
bock
is
very
sweet
with
a
thick
layer
of
oxidation
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
leaving
a
clingy
almost
vegetal
after
taste
the
oxidation
tastes
almost
metallic
like
crushed
apples
sitting
in
an
aluminum
tin
for
days
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
and
i
would
not
try
this
again
gordon
biersch
does
not
seem
to
get
too
much
respect
but
i
have
been
loving
there
stuff
lately
for
session
beers
and
this
one
does
quite
well
very
easy
to
drink
the
mouth
is
firm
pretty
heavy
body
for
what
it
is
carbonation
level
is
decent
the
flavors
are
unlike
any
other
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
this
is
more
like
an
english
mild
ale
or
a
weak
old
ale
dark
fruits
abound
some
plum
and
raisins
present
bitterness
is
moderate
theres
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
this
was
an
odd
offering
i
enjoyed
their
marzen
but
this
one
not
so
much
tried
this
at
the
city
paper
brew
festival
here
in
baltimore
ive
only
tried
a
few
maibocks
but
i
really
like
the
style
and
this
was
one
was
a
good
example
of
one
malty
very
little
hops
are
present
in
the
taste
mostly
the
taste
is
biscuity
with
some
herbal
sweetness
present
also
appearance
amber
very
little
lacing
drinkability
is
fairly
good
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
appropriately
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
toffee
green
apples
bread
dough
hay
a
little
mineraly
and
minty
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
out
with
some
bread
dough
and
hay
green
apples
toffee
raisin
mineraly
hops
alcohol
and
some
chalkiness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
than
i
expected
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
a
solid
maibock
but
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
this
beer
had
an
appropriately
thick
rich
mouthfeel
i
found
this
beer
to
be
surprising
just
how
nice
rich
and
enjoyable
this
was
nice
beer
drinkability
if
nothing
else
it
paired
surprisingly
well
with
the
cover
song
you
oughta
know
by
the
group
das
racist
while
for
me
at
least
none
of
the
bottle
gordon
biersch
brews
have
been
exemplary
theyve
at
least
been
sufficient
to
get
the
job
done
overall
well
this
is
all
right
slight
shortcomings
on
the
palate
and
appearance
are
made
up
for
by
pretty
good
aroma
and
flavor
for
the
style
d
this
is
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
taste
department
and
abv
to
be
something
you
want
to
have
too
much
of
at
one
time
but
it
is
a
perfect
beer
on
a
lazy
spring
afternoon
overall
a
good
beer
worth
trying
bottle
for
a
buck
at
whole
foods
clear
bronze
in
the
glass
brilliantly
clear

fact

two
fingers

albeit
filtered
to
death
apricot
peach
and
munich
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
more
acidic
fruit
though
its
on
the
sweet
side
the
taste
follows
suit
munich
malt
joining
light
fruity
esters
to
create
a
tasty
but
slightly
cloying
baked
stonefruit
flavor
medium
bodied
sweeter
than
id
like
and
not
particularly
quaffable
or
complex
this
is
decent
all
the
same
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
bubbles
fade
quickly
from
this
medheavy
lager
i
notice
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bloating
beer
still
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
well
at
least
until
i
fell
on
my
ass
drunk
as
a
skunk
look
is
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
the
nose
slips
as
does
the
flavor
but
never
to
a
point
of
damnation
the
biggest
problems
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
its
the
mouthfeel
rough
on
the
palate
and
dryer
then
i
would
expect
for
the
style
each
sip
seems
to
be
more
of
a
chore
then
a
pleasure
it
tastes
like
a
cookie
cutter
beer
and
isnt
as
good
as
the
others
in
gb
year
round
line
up
worth
a
try
but
ill
look

more
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
sipper
with
a
very
smooth
flavor
for
a
7
0abv
beer
but
the
muted
flavors
really
leave
me
wanting
more
flavor
if
they
doubled
the
malt
bill
it
would
have
a
great
flavor
the
beer
fares
better
than
most
other
gb
lagers
bold
in
its
maltiness
and
subtle
in
the
pilsner

the
beer
takes
on
a
hearty

tone
with
moderate

herbal
and
grassy
hops
prove
to
be
bold

balanced
both
in

and
bittering
spicy

to

too
sweet
to
have

than
a

this
is
not
the
greatest
or
most
fair
review
since
i
went
to
the
maibock
spring
release
party
tonight
and
tried
this
the
beer
had
a
clearish
auburn
color
with
good
head
and
some
decent
lacings
the
smell
to
my
nose
at
the
time
was
mildy
hoppy
and
had
nothing
else
the
taste
was
very
hoppy
while
the
body
was
full
and
filling
a
slick
passing
over
the
tongue
was
balanced
with
a
very
dry
result
on
the
backend
some
earth
and
grassy
notes
i
must
add
and
some
malts
like
bread
that
filled
the
stomach
quickly
this
isnt
a
good
review
i
reiterate
but
i
know
that
this
brew
was
fully
enjoyable
and
i
recommend
a
try
to
anyone
visiting
the
vb
location
soon
this
maibock
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
and
left
a
thin
layer
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
with
a
hint
of
munich
malt
and
a
note
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
strongly
malty
with
a
touch
of
munich
malt
and
a
faint
bit
of
caramel
the
light
malty
sweetness
was
balanced
by
a
nice
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
malty
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
malt
and
hops
lingered
nicely
in
the
finish
this
was
a
nice
american
take
on
a
german
maibock
poured
a
dense
opaque
apricotamber
color
a
bit
lighter
orange
at
the
base
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
had
a
decent
twofinger
head
but
left
no
lace
the
aroma
was
a
light
thin
malty
scent
with
some
very
faint
fruit
esthers
otherwise
there
wasnt
much
there
and
it
was
a
rather
bland
aroma
taste
possessed
a
rich
caramel
flavor
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
not
a
bad
flavor
for
sure
not
the
best
maibock
ive
had
this
season
but
not
the
worst
tasting
one
either
the
mouthfeel
had
an
almost
creamy
sensation
to
it
but
that
was
quickly
drowned
out
by
a
strong
carbonation
tang
which
detracted
a
bit
from
the
overall
tasting
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
not
one
id
return
to
in
the
future
ill
likely
stick

tastes
balance
is
there
but
drinkability
suffers
from
a
bit
too
heavy
maltiness
a
freshtasting
and
characterful
brew
aroma
is
sweet
and
tart
with
not
much
hop
presence
flavor
is
fruity
with
definite
raisin
and
orange
notes
finish
was
much
cleaner
than
something
with
this
much
malt
dominance
might
suggest
not
syrupy
like
the
stronger
bigbeer
maibocks
seemed
like
it
would
work
as
a
session
beer
and
it
has
the
taste
that
may
send
you
springing
for
the
outdoors
porch
balcony
or
biergarten
would
love
to
have
this
with
a
cheese
bread
and
fruit
picnic
this
spring
offering
is
one
of
the
heavier
g
biersch
brews
and
it
is
a
good
one
the
glass
displayed
a
cloudy
apricot
colored
beer
that
was
topped
by
a
decent
white
head
this
beer
laced
extremely
well
the
feel
was
fullbodied
creamy
and
smooth
the
nose
was
malty
bready
and
pleasant
the
overall
taste
was
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
but
also
reasonably
balanced
the
finish
was
quite
nice
and
followed
by
a
slight
and
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
you
can
not
taste
the
7
abv
in
the
beer
i
would
get
this
beer
over
a
heineken
beer
if
your
into
lagers
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
my
first
time
buying
any
kind
of
gordon
biersch
beer
so
far
no
disappointment
from
this
company
when
im
not
in
my
hoppy
mood
or
dark
style
kind
of
beers
i
would
get
another
six
pack
of
this
beer
my
review
probably
doesnt
give
outsiders
a
good
evaluation
but
i
have
not
had
too
many
blonde
bocks
and
this
one
is
good
until
proven
otherwise
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
liked
it
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
ok
but
wanted
a
bit
more
flavor
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
gb
has
a
few
good
beers
for
me
this
wasnt
one
i
them
according
to
the
brewerys
website
i
should
not
be
able
to
buy
this
beer
within
a
hundred
miles
of
where
i
live
but
i
actually
bought
a
six
pack
at
front
street
market
in
butte
montana
it
was
7something
a
six
pack
on
sale
overall
a
bit
sweeter
and
less
malty
then
i
was
anticipating
but
very
pleasant
none
the
less
a
nice
brew
for
the
price
o
not
really
my
thing
and
there
are
other
beers
in
this
category
that
can
do
it
more
justice
the
verdict
good
beer
a
solid
well
balanced
bock
offering
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
maybe
but
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
be
you
really
cant
ask
for
more
than
that
overall
i
would
only
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
likes
trying
different
bock
style
beers
it
did
come
in
a
variety
12
pack
so
im
hoping
there
is
some
gold
left
in
it
overall
if
theres
one
thing
gordonbiersch
does
well
its
lagers
this
one
is
no
exception
a
clean
fairly
crisp
and
wellbalanced
maibock
with
nice
character
a
fine
example
of
a
style
thats
not
so
common
in
the
u
s
gb
allows
its
brewers
to
perform
it
is
apparent
from
the
reviews
here
that
some
excel
and
some
dont
this
gb
brewer
cheektowaga
ny
got
it
right
a
mild
drink
overall
without
any
offensive
notes
or
redeeming
qualities
nothing
special
but
paired
with
some
salty
snacks
its
ok
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
biscuit
and
some
fruity
notes
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
a
bit
strong
but
drinkable
overall
boring
and
uninspired
it
was
drinkable
but
utterly
forgettable
on
tap
at
hopmonk
sebastol
location
a
decent
serviceable
blond
slightly
yeasty
dirty
blonde
flavour
which
was
fine
on
a
26
degree
fall
day
a
bit
funky
as
a
result
but
i
was
expecting
something
cleaner
and
a
mild
hoppy
ale
significant
retained
head
on
light
blond
body
carbonation
above
average
pours
a
nice
blonde
color
with
noticeable
carbonation
smell
is
malty
a
little
grainy
not
great
but
appropriate
tastes
malty
and
clean
with
a
smooth
feel
an
extra
kick
from
the
alcohol
is
nice
overall
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
great
beer
but
its
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
a
maibock
which
unfortunately
i
dont
see
much
of
around
these
parts
this
beer
pours
up
a
copper
color
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
smell
is
oranges
grass
and
bread
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
on
the
front
giving
way
to
gradual
hoppiness
on
the
finish
not
the
best
beer
ever
but
a
very
drinkable
one
review
from
102010
notes
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
no
lacing
light
bready
malt
aroma
light
sweet
bready
malt
a
hint
of
hops
and
some
light
adjunct
flavors
eh
not
bad
a
bad
beer
but
a
mediocre
bock
overall
a
solid
summertime
beer
this
is
a
good
choice
for
relaxing
in
warm
weather
while
watching
the
sun
set
pairs
well
with
spicy
and
saucy
type
foods
such
as
barbecued
ribs
and
has
a
descent
kick
with
its
7
abv
rjt
this
was
another
solid
offering
from
gb
they
seem
to
take
plain
old
german
styles
and
jump
them
up
a
notch
this
is
a
very
nice
take
on
another
typical
lager
style
looking
at
the
other
raters
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
pour
or
something
to
me
it
was
a
heavy
alcohol
bite
with
a
bad
finish
either
way
ill
stay
away
from
this
one
in
the
future
my
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
of
frenchvanilla
colored
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
nose
was
malty
but
not
as
pronounced
as
in
their
fest
bier
it
had
a
pleasant
malty
character
without
being
overwhelming
nor
was
there
a
lot
of
heat
evident
which
i
sometimes
get
in
bocks
mouthfeel
was
on
the
full
side
not
creamy
but
more
towards
viscous
and
the
sweetness
also
had
a
slight
metallic
tang
behind
it
finish
was
moderately
sweet
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
but
i
probably
would
not
want
a
whole
lot
of
it
at
one
time
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
very
offensive
but
not
the
greatest
offering
from
gordon
biersch
its
worth
the
purchase
inside
the
winter
12
pack
however
o
solid
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
would
recommend
or
pursue
again
o
decent
but
nothing
to
scream
about
i
prefer
many
of
the
other
gordon
beers
over
this
one
but
it
is
not
bad
dr
drinkable
but
pretty
crap
ill
never
have
it
again
i
was
expecting
something
quite
pale
and
light
given
gbs
other
beers
but
this
was
deeper
and
richer
than
i
expected
poured
a
clear
bronze
color
flat
almost
no
carbonation
and
certainly
no
head
i
was
skeptical
but
i
picked
it
up
anyway
aroma
of
grains
and
sweet
malts
sweet
and
malty
taste
but
very
lightthough
still
a
little
more
flavorful
than
an
old
e
very
mild
and
bland
for
the
most
part
kinda
just
tasted
like
thin
malt
juice
lightbodied
and
not
very
drinkable
its
probably
just
best
to
play
it
safe
and
avoid
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
biscuts
and
malts
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
also
biscuty
some
malts
a
touch
of
hops
kicks
in
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
it
has
good
hoppy
aftertaste
subtle
and
well
mannered
the
rest
of
the
malt
and
hops
are
well
balanced
i
wonder
if
it
is
any
better
on
tap
o
its
alright
looked
and
smelled
a
lot
better
than
it
tasted
odont
care
for
it
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
begins
with
citrus
with
hints
of
dough
and
vanilla
as
well
the
flavor
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
orange
honey
vanilla
notes
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
well
balanced
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
gordon
biersch
blonde
bock
is
a
refreshing
good
beer
highly
recommended
the
cpj
overall
a
decent
drinkable
brew
with
a
sweet
sticky
metallic
aftertaste
although
the
moderately
high
abv
does
make
it
easier
to
partake
after
each
swallow
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
the
born
on
date
was
on
january
6
2010
so
it
is
pretty
fresh
it
has
a
sweet
taste
whick
is
easy
to
drink
the
smell
is
refreshining
and
rather
fruity
and
sweet
its
not
very
hoppy
which
is
fine
with
me
if
you
like
light
beer
with
a
kick
and
gratifing
taste
you
will
like
gordon
its
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
leave
a
bad
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
superb
chill
it
aroma
starts
out
sour
gets
bready
sweet
and
has
a
light
noble
hop
background
appearance
is
light
gold
with
a
well
maintained
white
head
flavor
is
high
caramel
malt
sweetness
forward
with
moderate
bittering
but
a
low
noble
bittering
character
mouthfeel
is
moderate
bodied
with
a
medium
high
carb
texture
overall
fairly
easy
drinking
and
rich
but
not
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
though
it
has
a
fairly
robust
body
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
a
mixed
bag
the
sweetness
does
make
it
a
bit
hard
to
drink
but
it
does
mask
its
7
abv
quite
well
have
to
toss
it
some
points
there
that
said
i
wound
up
having
to
drain
pour
a
good
third
of
this
it
was
just
way
too
sweet
a
welldone
beer
just
not
quite
to
my
tastes
those
who
like
their
beers
sweet
should
give
this
a
shot
bottomline
if
i
wanted
to
introduce
a
weakling
to
bock
beerit
is
a
good
beer
to
ween
them
oall
fairly
clean
but
a
fairly
bland
bock
rich
but
not
very
exciting

pretty
nondescript

profile
minimal

presence
and
not
a

mouthfeel

on
the
light
side
of

effervescence
drinkability
inhibited
by
lack
of
distinctive
taste
and
noticeable
alcohol
not
my
favorite
gb
beer
pass
decent
drinkability
although
it
is
7
abv
d
nice
and
well
balanced
beer
slightly
above
average
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
better
than
average
overall
a
nice
beer
it
is
nothing
amazing
but
it
is
tasty
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
medium
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
very
mild
sweet
malt
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
and
a
little
toasty
some
fruit
notes
apples
etc
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
well
carbonated
easily
drinkable
very
nice
overall
in
looks
and
taste
this
blurs
the
lines
between
bock
and
maibock
and
has
a
bit
of
an
american
wheathefe
weizen
sort
of
thing
with
that
banana
character
and
other
tropical
fruits
gordon
biersch
isnt
exactly
the
hippest
and
hypeest
amongst
beer
cognoscenti
but
i
thought
this
offering
was
quite
good
which
must
mean
im
still
a
newbie
while
i
didnt
get
too
much
of
the
hallertau
spiciness
in
the
nose
it
immediately
presented
itself
with
the
first
sips
of
beer
along
with
the
spiciness
which
was
only
exacerbated
by
the
finebubbled
carbonation
it
had
a
bitterly
sweet
presence
that
intertwined
with
grainy
malts
and
a
zesty
alcoholic
bite
that
warmed
me
after
each
swallow
it
holds
a
very
solid
medium
mouthfeel
that
seemed
to
press
the
lighter
bitterness
into
the
roof
of
my
mouth
while
the
heavier
alcohol
and
malts
slid
over
my
tongue
it
was
a
curious
sensation
to
say
the
least
my
only
complaint
with
this
brew
is
that
it
leaves
quite
a
sticky
bitter
almost
sour
aftertaste
but
with
7
abv
it
proved
itself
to
be
remarkably
quaffable
once
i
got
going
gordan
biersch
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sam
adams
always
playing
it
safe
to
please
the
masses
its
a
good
beer
overall
very
drinkable
at
7
abv
but
i
cant
help
feeling
that
gb
should
put
out
something
that
is
a
little
more
robust
d
not
bad
its
like
an
average
bock
and
i
liked
that
it
wasnt
too
sweet
like
allot
of
bocks
tend
to
be
i
didnt
like
that
the
flavor
profile
was
a
bit
boring
i
could
set
down
with
a
couple
over
some
food
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
worth
a
try
i
suppose
especially
for
bock
fans
cheers
d
a
great
beer
to
sit
beside
the
fire
with
on
a
cool
autumn
night
very
quaffable
appearance
has
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
thin
head
with
no
lace
smell
although
somewhat
faint
is
rich
in
malts
mild
fruits
and
honey
taste
has
mild
but
rich
malts
that
carry
a
honey
note
that
is
mildly
hoped
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
medium
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
go
down
easy
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
true
for
the
style
but
not
bad
overall
this
is
not
bad
with
a
year
on
it
so
fresh
must
be
great
i
finally
found
a
fresher
bottle
so
ill
do
a
comparison
and
update
my
review
accordingly
very
great
beer
overall
because
of
the
contract
work
and
multiple
brewpub
location
they
do
get
shot
down
in
the
community
but
i
think
this
is
a
exceptional
beer
took
a
chance
on
this
one
as
the
last
2
six
packs
had
a
freshness
dating
of
december
2009
however
this
is
still
a
very
tasty
beer
with
tons
of
flavour
still
tasted
fresh
the
beer
is
hoppy
and
also
slightly
sweet
though
age
might
have
dried
it
out
i
liked
the
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
and
found
it
true
to
the
style
gordon
biersch
is
turning
into
one
of
my
most
underated
breweries
as
the
hefe
is
also
a
great
buy
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
im
not
buying
it
again
i
like
slightly
higher
quality
beers
if
im
going
to
pay
a
good
amount
of
money
for
them
d
great
drinker
deserves
better
than
a
c
overall
this
is
a
fine
bock
one
of
gordon
bierschs
best
brews
worth
seeking
out
notes
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
the
hops
and
malts
are
muted
enough
that
the
alcohol
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
its
not
a
pleasant
rounded
alcohol
flavor
either
its
harsh
and
medicinal
the
malts
are
trying
to
balance
but
they
just
dont
have
the
presence
they
need
unless
youre
a
gordon
biersch
fan
i
recommend
you
pass
on
this
one
d
easy
to
drink
no
bad
in
any
way
but
lack
of
character
would
keep
me
from
returning
to
it
gordon
biersch
makes
decent
german
lagers
i
have
not
been
disappointed
in
any
of
this
breweries
beers
i
have
tried
blonde
bock
is
no
exception
and
is
another
good
solid
beer
not
for
beer
lovers
at
all
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
overall
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
enough
to
merit
having
once
in
a
while
overall
a
well
crafted
good
tasting
brew
i
dont
drink
many
bocks
but
gb
seems
to
get
these
right
i
would
buy
again
and
would
seek
out
to
try
on
draft
expensive
for
what
it
is
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
average
as
you
can
tell
by
my
rating
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
gold
color
and
had
an
off
white
head
smell
was
sweet
and
yeasty
the
taste
was
fruity
and
rather
confusing
i
will
not
buy
this
again
it
was
not
great
nice
easy
drinking
beer
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
i
like
it
drinkability
its
sweet
its
smooth
and
an
overall
okay
blonde
bock
notes
ive
never
had
this
style
before
so
maybe
i
just
dont
care
for
it
but
the
two
other
people
drinking
this
with
me
agreed
it
was
not
all
the
pleasant
not
that
great
of
flavors
and
what
was
there
was
not
balanced
the
flavors
seemed
much
too
thin
to
support
such
a
high
alcohol
beer
just
seemed
out
of
whack
we
all
agreed
we
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
again
drinkability
solid
beer
that
i
would
atleast
drink
but
not
a
beer
lovers
beer
at
all
drinkability
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
not
on
the
list
of
ones
i
need
but
its
ok
overall
some
complexity
and
depth
to
the
malt
with
a
clean
finish
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
look
for
it
again
a
local
expert
in
my
opinion
at
five
points
bottle
shop
recently
shared
some
beers
with
the
owner
and
brewer
of
gordon
biersch
and
from
what
i
understand
the
yeasts
come
from
german
lines
and
gb
is
faithful
to
the
lager
styles
that
they
brew
fairly
drinkable
and
a
pretty
decent
take
on
the
helles
bock
style
not
too
far
off
in
any
direction
accessible
and
quite
tasty
drinkability
decent
beer
tastes
of
light
floral
notes
with
some
earthy
hops
in
the
back
this
beer
is
very
subtle
so
suble
that
its
very
hard
for
me
to
pick
out
individual
flavors
its
good
however
defenite
complexity
and
the
lager
finish
really
works
for
this
beer
it
his
the
abv
well
and
goes
down
wuite
smoothly
i
really
like
this
beer
i
dont
love
it
but
i
liek
it
a
lot
d
i
rate
this
good
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
when
fitting
to
style
not
so
much
pours
a
pale
dark
yellow
colored
body
with
a
small
whitish
color
head
small
and
diminishing
has
a
vegetabley
aroma
and
some
maltiness
not
too
bad
somewhat
enticing
has
a
vegetably
taste
some
sourness
malty
not
good
d
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
there
really
isnt
any
complexity
at
all
with
this
one
and
it
is
pretty
much
all
alcohol
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
again
in
the
future
an
okay
bock
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
very
drinkable
though
pours
rather
translucent
with
thin
white
head
that
disappears
nose
is
faint
with
some
some
honey
and
maybe
melon
palate
delivers
the
expected
malt
focus
light
hops
good
carbonation
and
alcohol
warmth
very
drinkable
and
a
style
that
is
underappreciated
unfortunately
it
is
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
i
would
grab
for
all
the
time
12
oz
clear
dark
gold
pour
white
head
nearly
nonexistent
but
a
little
ring
does
stick
around
aroma
is
some
grapefruit
a
little
pine
a
little
heinekenmeh
the
flavor
has
some
nice
malt
with
a
little
citrus
and
pine
pretty
lively
mouthfeel
unfortunately
the
overriding
tone
to
me
in
this
is
that
heinie
flavor
not
quite
sure
i
would
even
classify
this
as
a
bock
ok
as
far
as
bocks
go
anyways
could
drink
a
few
but
will
only
do
so
since
i
bought
a
sixer
i
wouldnt
bother
trying
this
more
than
once
a
heinie
clone
for
comparison
sake
beer
poured
gold
with
a
very
long
lasting
white
head
nose
is
malt
city
with
some
corn
lingering
in
the
back
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
corn
finishing
with
a
decent
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
and
somewhat
lively
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
good
i
am
surprised
at
how
drinkable
this
brew
is
i
would
not
mind
having
this
again
in
the
future
the
aroma
is
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
nicely
done
balance
there
is
also
a
corn
like
element
to
it
the
appearance
pale
gold
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
like
the
aroma
with
a
obvious
corn
presence
the
palate
is
thin
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
drinkability
this
doesnt
make
me
want
to
try
any
other
gb
products
as
this
one
is
drinkable
but
nothing
id
want
to
session
or
really
try
again
but
still
its
average
if
not
a
bit
better
i
think
overall
m
d
moderate
carbonation
though
body
feels
a
little
thin
or
slightly
diluted
the
alcohol
notes
become
more
apparent
as
it
warms
and
give
it
a
touch
of
harshness
not
really
my
thing
at
the
end
of
the
day
blonde
bockmai
bock
is
my
favorite
lager
style
and
in
the
spring
i
look
forward
to
trying
new
ones
this
poured
into
a
5
liter
stein
a
full
rich
golden
not
blonde
with
a
fluffy
very
well
defined
white
head
thaat
turned
into
a
creamy
mass
after
settling
slowly
aromas
were
not
pleasantlike
wet
grain
with
some
sort
of
spoiled
corn
elementjust
not
good
the
flavors
didnt
show
many
of
the
nasty
attributes
of
the
smell
wich
is
goodbig
buttery
caramel
sweetness
with
some
sweet
alcohol
and
and
toasty
grain
in
a
lingering
finish
if
you
take
away
the
bad
smell
this
is
a
pretty
good
blond
bockjust
needs
some
tweekin
the
sharp
boozy
aspect
takes
some
of
the
joy
out
of
this
beer
give
it
a
pass
drinkability
that
aftertaste
brings
the
marks
down
here
too
bad
as
the
beer
has
a
number
of
commendable
elements
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
very
pleasant
surprise
very
tasty
and
very
reasonably
priced
i
really
dont
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
but
its
a
misfire
this
beer
is
so
boozy
its
going
to
be
very
hard
to
finish
even
fridgecold
some
styles
dont
lend
themselves
to
huge
abvs
and
this
is
one
of
them
this
is
dopplebock
levels
with
no
malt
to
back
it
up
seems
like
they
used
3
parts
corn
sugar
to
one
part
malt
i
cant
believe
i
paid
craft
prices
for
steel
reserve
in
disguise
never
again
overall
not
one
that
i
enjoyed
made
it
thru
but
barely
i
love
most
of
the
other
bierschs
so
gave
this
one
a
shot
ill
stick
to
their
awesome
hefe
and
schwarzbier
dont
recommend
unless
you
are
a
big
bock
fan
one
and
done
d
eh
gb
makes
a
fine
beer
but
this
seems
too
far
from
the
bock
model
an
american
bock
and
we
already
have
a
texas
bock
muddying
the
waters
nothing
great
nothing
wrong
here
taste
mouthfeel
up
front
coating
dryness
strangely
husky
and
astringent
with
some
fruity
apricot
sweetness
barely
present
beneath
dry
finish
with
more
astringency
pretty
terrible
stuff
i
couldnt
even
finish
12
oz
of
it
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
white
fluffy
head
with
some
lacing
on
the
glass
couldnt
really
pick
up
much
aroma
maybe
a
little
caramel
malt
a
little
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
with
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
note
well
balanced
with
the
grassy
hops
its
not
going
to
blow
you
away
with
flavor
but
its
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
poured
a
lifeless
strawyellow
into
a
pint
glasslifeless
in
that
no
head
resulted
granted
the
style
may
not
be
the
paragon
of
flavor
but
this
one
looked
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
bland
macro
i
got
a
a
little
corn
grain
and
almost
nothing
more
in
the
nose
i
tasted
some
malt
and
bread
in
the
body
but
this
beer
was
just
dull
with
some
subtle
earthy
grainy
sweetness
the
beer
was
pretty
fullbodied
and
it
was
drinkable
sort
of
a
like
a
lesscarbonated
macro
however
the
taste
definitely
didnt
make
me
want
to
drink
it
d
at
7
this
is
hardly
a
slamming
beer
but
its
smooth
and
pleasant
and
before
you
know
it
you
had
three
or
four
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
for
a
beer
that
has
the
word
bock
written
on
the
side
if
it
is
brewed
in
the
usa
if
i
want
to
nitpick
it
is
a
bit
hoppy
a
little
underrepresented
on
the
carbonation
and
maybe
the
water
could
use
a
bit
of
adjusting
but
that
is
seriously
nitpicking
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
again
especially
over
some
of
the
bocks
available
here
in
texas
pale
styles
of
beer
are
less
forgiving
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
a
pretty
good
bock
more
colorful
than
most
ive
tried
however
the
flavor
isnt
something
that
makes
you
crave
more
dry
alcohol
aftertaste
is
boring
d
well
balanced
flavor
profile
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
will
definitely
get
back
for
more
i
am
glad
my
local
gb
added
this
to
their
lineup
this
fall
the
taste
is
also
very
nice
smooth
yet
interesting
with
bread
crust
raisin
with
a
persistent
smooth
alcoholic
warmth
bite
and
spiceiness
it
has
firm
sweetness
bit
moves
into
a
finish
that
has
clean
bitter
dry
leaves
and
dry
grass
as
well
as
raisiny
spiciness
very
weak
aroma
with
some
hops
very
clear
and
pleasant
looking
beer
though
with
a
tough
flavor
but
gentle
on
the
palate
not
a
very
flavorful
or
tasy
bock
the
flavor
was
just
a
bit
too
harsh
which
is
odd
becuase
to
the
palate
it
is
a
beer
that
has
a
pleasant
feel
to
the
mouth
d
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
hot
days
as
its
very
light
tasting
and
more
thirstquenching
than
i
was
expecting
poured
a
deep
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
medium
amout
of
foam
and
some
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
hops
and
malts
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
a
tart
bitter
sweetness
and
not
really
that
bad
of
a
typical
blonde
bock
no
really
dissapointed
but
just
wish
there
was
something
a
little
extra
to
the
flavor
of
this
blonde
bock
its
a
clear
yellow
brew
looks
a
little
like
urine
but
with
a
white
head
that
fades
gradually
nose
is
musty
hops
and
slight
sweetness
taste
is
mild
grassy
hops
with
european
hop
qualities
a
bit
lagerish
even
malt
sweetness
too
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
not
bad
bottled
on
date
of
10307
nice
light
gold
color
but
very
little
head
bottle
says
rich
and
i
would
find
that
an
accurate
description
nice
understated
malt
aroma
full
really
full
flavor
taste
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
have
a
such
a
nice
lager
clean
mouthfeel
great
beer
to
have
this
time
of
year
to
break
up
all
the
heavy
winter
ales
that
i
have
drinking
d
a
bit
hoppy
for
me
but
it
is
a
hele
bock
beer
so
very
pilsnery
which
im
generally
not
crazy
about
but
this
adds
a
nice
bit
of
sweet
malt
thus
gets
a
higher
score
from
this
ba
if
your
stuck
in
a
san
francisco
airport
you
could
do
much
much
worse
pours
a
yellowcopper
color
with
a
full
foamy
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
decent
while
sweet
malty
nose
you
can
smell
the
high
gravity
for
sure
the
taste
is
extremely
malty
and
you
can
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
i
can
drink
these
all
of
the
time
only
thing
i
would
change
is
a
hint
more
on
the
hops
side
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
good
brew
on
tap
at
the
gb
brewpub
in
honolulu
harbor
crystal
clear
bright
gold
slight
head
no

smelled
of
honey
and
floral

slight

ester
very
appealing
bright
taste
starts
with
honey
with
a
hop
bite
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
kick
along
with
the
dunkel
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
they
make
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
that
is
scrubbed
clean
with
the
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brew
however
it
is
a
little
dullflatone
dimensional
in
the
flavor
department
making
it
something
i
wouldnt
spend
an
evening
with
i
agree
with
ding
this
is
a
very
good
strong
brew
a
brilliantly
clear
straw
color
with
sparkling
carbonation
could
have
better
head
retention
strong
sweet
pilsner
malt
aromas
have
a
honeylike
sweetness
with
light
earthygrain
flavors
hops
offset
the
sweetness
but
contribute
little
in
the
way
of
flavor
or
aromas
spicy
from
the
saaz
and
from
highter
than
normal
alcohols
a
sweet
alcohol
and
evaporative
feel
both
approach
teethhurting
and
warming
finishes
sweet
with
a
light
hop
bite
even
with
a
few
inconsistencies
it
has
enough
intrigue
to
win
over
some
taste
buds
sampled
from
12
oz
bottle
have
had
on
tap
before
but
this
review
is
for
the
bottle
pours
amberorange
with
decent
head
the
hung
around
for
a
little
while
and
left
trace
amounts
of
lace
although
new
to
the
bock
style
i
enjoyed
the
taste
strong
malts
but
didnt
notice
the
hops
much
malt
dominated
the
taste
could
also
tell
this
was
a
higher
alcohol
brew
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
due
to
the
malt
and
low
carbonation
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
from
what
i
recall
i
enjoyed
the
tap
version
better
of
course
drinkability
pretty
nice
not
outstanding
not
to
bad
just
about
what
you
would
expect
from
gordon
biesch
a
pretty
nice
easy
drinking
bock
not
overly
interesting
but
its
pleasant
and
well
worth
the
reasonable
price
of
5
99
for
a
six
pack
pours
a
light
hazyish
amber
with
a
nice
foamy
head
good
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
malts
slight
alcohols
peeking
through
though
taste
is
full
of
medium
bodied
creamy
malts
slight
sweetness
nice
and
filling
but
still
refreshing
only
weak
point
is
the
alcohols
in
the
taste
as
in
the
nose
over
all
i
would
buy
this
in
bottles
to
stock
at
my
house
the
carbonation
is
thinner
than
many
other
beers
but
it
comes
out
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
as
a
result
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
like
lagers
as
well
as
ales
it
is
certainly
refreshing
d
not
very
bock
like
pretty
straight
forward
but
not
a
big
fan
of
any
metallic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
that
was
quite
cleansing
overall
very
drinkable
i
have
this
beer
on
a
bunch
of
occasions
and
consider
it
a
very
nice
offering
for
gb
was
it
worth
6
bucks
a
six
pack
yes
but
not
much
more
than
that
however
it
is
a
true
rep
of
the
style
but
not
top
none
of
gb
beers
are
but
they
usually
hit
the
spot
finishes
just
a
tad
too
harsh
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
imparts
an
earthy
bitterness
which
interrupts
the
flavor
and
drinkability
too
much
for
a
blond
bock
somewhat
waxy
afterpalate
shame
this
beer
falls
short
at
the
end
its
solid
otherwise
its
a
nice
dark
blonde
color
with
decent
head
not
an
amazing
aroma
but
malty
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
malt
and
a
satisfying
hop
finish
nothing
too
complex
or
memorable
though
mouthfeel
is
decent
smooth
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
a
7
0
abv
beer
nice
to
have
a
couple
at
a
bbq
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
lighter
side
of
medium
body
overall
seems
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
an
ok
beer
drink
if
nothing
else
is
available
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
the
sharpness
in
the
flavor
gets
a
bit
tiresome
i
probably
would
not
have
another
d
its
a
drinkable
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
however
crisp
and
tart
the
7
abv
could
hurt
you
but
for
a
couple
this
was
a
pleasurable
offering
i
havent
been
terribly
impressed
by
what
gordon
biersch
has
had
to
offer
but
this
was
a
surprise
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
just
like
traditional
german
bocks
the
taste
retains
the
same
sweet
malty
taste
but
adds
the
light
presense
of
bubbles
there
is
something
about
the
fullmouth
flavor
that
comes
with
this
beer
that
really
makes
it
enjoyable
and
different
from
many
beers
because
of
this
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
the
drinkability
is
high
drinking
six
of
these
should
be
enjoyable
for
someone
who
drinks
pale
ales
with
lower
alcohol
this
one
at
7
is
very
drinkable
its
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
its
a
very
crisp
refreshing
beer
also
with
the
7
alcohol
content
which
you
cannot
taste
until
the
beer
really
warms
up
itd
be
an
easy
to
drink
fun
session
beer
to
drink
with
friends
gordon
biersch
blonde
bock
isnt
really
my
thing
lovers
of
the
style
might
find
a
good
deal
to
like
however
having
such
little
knowledge
of
the
style
and
even
less
interest
i
cant
even
make
that
call
with
any
degree
of
certainty
good
drinkability
difficult
to
identify
the
unbalance
of
this
bottled
beer
better
on
tap
in
palo
alto
and
the
finish
lingers
a
metallic
grapefruit
flavor
this
is
certainly
drinkable
and
i
begrudingly
recommend
it
p
i
had
no
clue
it
was
7
abv
as
it
is
hidden
and
not
detectable
at
all
a
very
nice
brew
and
it
worked
very
well
on
a
hot
day
of
brewing
might
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
thumbs
up
it
wasnt
golden
in
appearance
like
the
label
would
indicate
no
big
deal
just
odd
that
its
actually
more
tan
than
anything
very
heavy
wheat
taste
tastes
cheap
carbonation
just
pummels
the
palate
overwhelming
carbonation
that
sizzles
even
in
the
aftertaste
medicinal
type
taste
in
the
middle
mixed
with
grain
tasted

drinkability
odd
tasting
beer
maybe
i
snagged
a
bad
one
may
have
to
review
this
one
another
time
although
this
is
the
first
blonde
bock
i
have
ever
had
oh
well
live
and
learn
clean
golden
color
with
small
amounts
of
carbonation
floating
lazily
to
the
top
small
white
head
doesnt
last
long
but
makes
for
an
overall
beautful
beer
while
its
there
aroma
and
taste
of
green
apples
and
pears
but
not
enough
to
hide
the
formidable
7
abv
light
carmel
and
lemon
finish
not
quite
enough
hops
to
balance
the
sugariness
medium
light
bodied
an
excellent
lager
for
the
price
very
drinkable
one
of
my
standards
marked
by
a
grainy
even
juicy
malt
this
beautiful
helles
bock
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
its
golden
body
has
a
light
orangeish
tint
beneath
its
short
but
very
creamy
brightwhite
head
the
head
retention
is
quite
good
given
its
7
alcohol
content
and
it
leaves
walls
of
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
fresh
with
lightly
candysweet
and
grainy
malt
that
beckons
you
to
imbibe
a
zesty
finebubbled
carbonation
cuts
through
some
of
its
medium
body
leaving
it
to
appear
a
touch
thinner
than
it
is
and
awakens
the
tastebuds
before
the
beer
slides
smoothly
away
balance
is
what
the
flavor
is
all
about
and
its
sweetish
dose
of
malt
is
balanced
by
a
lowlying
bitterness
and
snappy
alcoholic
bite
as
it
warms
the
richness
widens
but
it
never
steps
beyond
its
bounds
its
not
intended
to
be
a
complex
beer
just
a
rich
one
and
it
succeeds
masterfully
its
masterfully
brewed
and
despite
its
alcohol
content
it
remains
highly
drinkable
the
taste
was
very
sweet
almost
too
much
for
my
taste
a
strong
carmel
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bitter
in
the
end
nothing
more
really
stood
out
to
me
good
crisp
carbonation
for
the
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
would
prefer
something
a
little
more
complex
drinkability

this
one
is
a
little
much
to
qualify
as
a
session
beer
which
i
think
all
bocks
should
be
able
to
do
but
it
was
drinkable
on
a
limited
scale
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
round
of
it
but
it
wasnt
bad
pours
a
clear
golden
liquid
with
a
good
thick
white
head
the
head
disappeared
way
too
quick
for
me
very
little
lace
on
the
glass
typical
pale
malt
smell
with
a
touch
of
earthyness
malty
up
front
the
malt
had
some
degree
of
depth
to
it
dry
at
the
end
with
very
little
bitterness
light
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
outstanding
and
when
you
do
you
may
be
slightly
disappointed
not
because
its
bad
but
because
its
so
pretty
you
expect
it
to
be
better
gbbb
is
more
hoppy
than
malty
and
leaves
a
very
slight
metallic
aftertaste
and
because
of
its
high
alcohol
content
7
0
you
may
not
want
more
than
one
overall
id
rate
it
good
but
nowhere
close
to
great
not
bad
by
any
means
pours
a
solid
orangegold
color
a
semi
white
head
is
decent
to
the
eye
lacing
is
average
the
smell
is
of
syrup
and
sweet
sugar
malts
slight
hints
of
molasses
the
tase
is
of
applecaramel
and
molasses
no
real
hop
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
still
not
powerful
wich
is
good
in
a
golden
bock
still
a
bit
rich
for
me
this
was
an
almost
nonexistent
beer
when
i
went
to
biersch
in
columbus
i
was
impressed
beyond
average
with
the
beers
that
theyd
had
there
but
this
just
isnt
that
great
id
probably
give
it
a
try
on
draft
but
the
bottle
isnt
something
that
particular
impresses
me
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
despite
its
7
abv
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
settled
into
a
small
rim
of
foam
and
left
little
lace
the
smell
was
quite
grainy
and
had
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
to
it
the
flavor
was
pretty
good
with
a
good
sturdy
malt
backbone
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
background
a
good
offering
from
gb
appearance
amber

with
a

not
that
great

medium

strong
lager
not
my

of
tea
ive
had
better
german
and
american
brewed
versions
drinkability
lacks
many
characteristics
to
bring
a
high
level
of
drinkability
getting
one
down
is
a
job
not
well
constructed
a
bit
harsh
with
the
grainy
offness
and
overbearing
alcohol
the
smell
is
a
little
subdued
but
still
hints
at
the
potency
at
hand
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
the
flavor
however
it
tastes
cheap
and
overly
grainy
its
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
contents
but
its
not
something
i
really
enjoyed
a
drinkable
brew
packs
a
punch
too
this
bock
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
very
light
malt
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
minimal
hop
bitterness
there
was
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
phenols
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
low
carbonation
the
flavor
lingered
for
a
fleeting
moment
this
beer
was
ok
though
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
high
abv
bock
overall
a
decent
beer
that
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
earthshattering
about
it
but
ive
had
worse
in
my
time
gold
color
with
a
nice
head
nothing
striking
about
the
aroma
maybe
some
floral
scent
not
too
much
though
taste
refreshing
and
clean
malty
for
a
blonde
but
it
is
a
bock
confused
yet
nice
finish
with
a
lil
leftover
malt
on
the
tongue
ill
definitely
have
this
again
overall
i
dont
know
if
this
just
isnt
my
type
of
beer
or
its
just
not
good

my
guest
and
give
it

with

i
certainly
wouldnt

was
a

from
the
downtown

knock
this
lil
bugger
down
to
a

and
you
got
yourself
a
fan
the
real
thing
to
ponder
with
this
beer
is
the
overwhelming
smoothness
of
it
in
the
face
of
7
alcohol
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
makes
it
a
dangerous
bar
stool
beer
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
beer
in
almost
3
years
i
guess
im
way
over
due

had
this
in
a
pub
in
the
phoenix
airport
a
clear
deep
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
had
to
strain
my
nostrils
to
get
any
aroma
just
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
flavor
is
very
boring
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
thin
for
a
bock
overall
a
very
very
boring
beer
had
this
at
gbs
burbank
location
it
golden
with
a
sticky
white
head
both
the
smell
and
taste
are
on
the
light
side
but
the
alcohol
somehow
doesnt
overwhelm
it
although
the
lack
of
a
strong
alcohol
taste
and
smell
makes
it
more
drinkable
the
overall
experience
is
nothing
special
on
draught
at
frog
bear

coincidentally
not
available

for

this

will
definitely
be
visiting
this

again
recommended
another

there
is
not
a

going
on
here
but
as
a
good
maibock
should
be
i
really
like
the
clean
pale
malt
flavor
of
this
brew
it
is
accentuated
just
enough
by
the
noticeable
hops
in

add

and
one
i
should
drink
more
of
at
the
beginning
of
the
baseball
season
instead
of
the
end
flavor
is
just
more
of
the
fruit
flavor
balancing
with
a

boatload
of

very
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
springlike

grain
aroma
the
brew
also
has
a
light
caramel
malt
taste
honey
a
bit
bready
not
much
hops
detected
the
feel
is
moderate
and
sort
of
creamy
for
a
lager
which
is
a
bit
odd
but
not
bad
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
and
lighter
end
for
a
boch
but
a
good
transition
from
the
winter
brews
to
the
summer
brews
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
a
bitter
bite
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
fair
inch
amount
of
head
that
soon
dissipated
it
had
a
bready
smell
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
first
sip
conjured
up
the
image
of
a
soft
pretzel
drizzled
with
honey
a
little
spicy
and
a
little
flowery
with
a
slightly
heavy
mouthfeel
i
found
it
a
great
spring
beer
that
is
perfect
for
enjoying
before
you
break
out
the
hefes
bottle
courtesy
of
moejuck
poured
a
deep
amber
slightly
cloudy
color
bock
with
a
nice
foamy
dirty
white
color
head
with
nice
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
overpowering
and
a
bit
surprising
for
a
bock
taste
is
sweeter
then
expected
and
missing
some
of
the
nutty
malt
quality
that
i
was
expecting
body
is
quite
full
with
some
adequate
carbonation
definitely
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
not
the
best
from
this
usually
fine
brewery
very
good
drinkability
i
will
purchase
a
few
more
before
the
end
of
may
overall
a
very
nice
bock
a
nice
grain
bill
makes
this
an
easy
and
enjoyable
drinker
highly
recommended
d
very
tasty
goes
down
with
ease
slightly
filling
good
kick
to
it
its
a
beer
worth
sticking
with
for
a
whole
evening
i
dont
drink
beers
in
this
style
very
often
but
each
time
i
do
im
reminded
of
how
much
i
like
the
style
and
how
underrated
i
believe
the
style
is
as
a
whole
in
particular
i
think
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
this
offering
from
southampton
pours
a
dark
orange
leaving
a
thick
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
tart
sour
citrus
with
a
bready
toffee
ending
the
taste
starts
bitter
from
the
tartness
in
the
hops
and
is
balanced
by
a
smooth
malty
caramel
feel
on
the
palate
leaving
a
fresh
grassy
finish
this
offering
from
southampton
is
delicious
even
in
during
this
snow
storm
in
march
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
wished
i
had
a
six
pack
and
not
just
a
bomber
pours
a
hazy
orangy
to
copper
color
smells
of
honey
slight
alcohol
and
nice
grains
other
fruits
going
on
i
cannot
detect
not
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
glass
but
who
cares
hits
you
with
some
nice
munich
malts
upfront
with
a
decent
hoppy
back
a
balanced
beer
for
sure
and
competes
with
the
best
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
like
pears
bread
and
a
little
nutty
it
mostly
tastes
like
grainbread
but
i
can
also
taste
some
pears
and
hops
too
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
slick
the
drinkability
is
good
as
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
the
first
southampton
beer
ive
tried
and
i
think
its
pretty
decent
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
imo
this
brew
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
spongylooking
slightly
tan
head
3cm
that
quickly
fizzles
to
a
surface
layer
nothing
special
but
who
says
it
has
to
be
special
to
look
at
aroma
is
pretty
typical
of
most
lagers
with
maybe
a
bit
more
alcohol
phenols
along
with
the
aroma
of
welchs
grape
juice
along
with
a
sweet
plum
interesting
sipping
reveals
a
slight
grapejuice
flavor
right
up
front
along
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
that
i
think
lends
itself
from
the
alcohol
presence
the
swallow
is
taken
over
by
a
slight
bitter
grainy
hops
flavor
that
balances
this
out
a
bit
but
doesnt
suit
me
as
well
as
hoped
due
to
the
grain
flavor
a
medium
body
that
lets
go
of
some
fizzy
carbonation
right
of
front
much
like
ginger
ale
but
not
much
alcohol
present
but
a
slightly
drying
finish
just
not
a
finish
like
most
basic
lagers
overall
i
found
this
one
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
wouldnt
turn
another
bottle
down
solid
showing
from
shampton
cheers
good
drinkability
level
and
well
crafted
beer
served
at
50
degrees
poured
a
light
brown
interesting
color
smell
was
slightly
nutty
head
went
away
quick
beer
had
a
good
taste
especially
for
a
high
beer
there
was
no
harsh
or
stinging
aftertaste
i
liked
the
beer
but
it
was
really
nothing
outstanding
so
i
will
have
to
say
this
one
is
a
no
repeate
purchase
for
6
7
though
this
was
extremely
smooth
tasty
at
the
right
time
place
despite
what
i
said
having
to
finish
a
bomber
might
have
done
it
in
for
me
somewhat
but
my
first
impression
of
this
style
seems
to
have
gone
well
now
with
better
familiarity
i
look
foward
to
next
years
batch
the
positive
amendment
it
will
undoubtedly
bring
sokay
though
not
bad
actually
quite
good
but
id
hope
for
more
this
is
a
very
tasty
drinkable
beer
like
i
said
previously
though
it
seems
closer
to
a
belgian
dubbel
to
me
than
a
maibock
d
its
pretty
good
but
doesnt
have
anything
close
to
a
wow
factor
wellmade
enjoyable
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
without
the
bite
ill
admit
that
i
only
bought
it
because
it
was
on
sale
for
3
27
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
beer
id
ever
crave
but
it
did
the
trick
and
im
certainly
glad
i
tried
it
a
big
east
coaster
thanks
to
the
big
k
syrbeer
for
all
the
extras
from
a
happily
returned
box
of
goodies
from
long
ago
a
clean
amberorange
beer
has
a
small
off
white
head
no
lace
the
aroma
has
a
light
sweetness
to
ti
with
hints
of
fruit
apple
and
toffee
light
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
sweep
over
your
tongue
with
a
hint
of
coffee
as
a
easy
spicey
hop
finish
washes
down
the
back
of
your
throat
decent
beer
over
all
but
not
one
that
i
would
rush
back
to
despite
the
fact
that
i
know
it
is
not
there
i
still
find
myself
thinking
that
there
is
some
adjunct
in
here
just
has
a
hint
of
corniness
or
something
similar
either
way
its
a
good
beer
for
the
price
and
i
would
recommend
it
drinkability
i
definitely
didnt
have
drinking
this
whole
bottle
down
in
fact
the
bottle
was
almost
all
gone
before
i
knew
it
it
was
that
good
one
of
the
best
maibocks
ive
had
and
if
this
is
the
standard
of
southampton
i
will
have
to
pick
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
drinkability
southampton
may
bock
is
very
drinkable
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
from
ipas
apas
and
the
such
nice
and
fruity
with
a
big
malt
back
bone
though
the
hops
make
an
ever
so
slight
appearance
with
a
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
malty
sweetnes
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
for
almost
a
7
abv
though
a
warming
of
the
face
is
present
definitetly
one
i
will
seek
again
and
a
style
that
i
am
liking
more
and
more
seek
out
and
enjoy
d
very
drinkable
and
well
made
representative
of
the
style
yea
i
agree
with
most
other
bas
in
that
this
beer
is
very
good
with
or
without
considering
its
style
its
even
better
than
many
of
the
german
counterparts
that
i
have
tried
a
very
nice
golden
orange
copper
color
with
a
mildly
heavy
consistancy

evident

the

with
a
slight

spiciness
boldy

with
peaches
apples
and
appricots
a
mild
bread

character
follows
up
promising
creaminess
and

the
flavors
distribute
a
pleasant
blend
of
amber
malts
and
subtle
graininess

to
impress
me
which
each
new
offering
i
try
22oz

my
first
southampton
and
it
did
not
disappoint

malt
and
some

of

slightly
and
there
were
no

around
that
i
could
smell
taste

very
well
balanced
with
sweet

up

and
a
nice
mildly
hopped

i
picked
up

scent
did
not
make
an
appearance
in
the
taste
medium

medium

and
mildly
drying
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nice

and
one
i
would
like
to
have
again
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
have
been
drinking
it
recently
to
better
acquaint
myself
with
that
said
i
found
this
one
better
than
the
others
that
ive
had
so
far
and
find
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
will
i
buy
it
again

character
to
cut
it
nicely
taste
follows
along
similarly
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
soft
and
drinkability
is
excellent
i
could
revisit
this
one
over
and
over
celebrating
spring
all
year
long
if
theyd
let
me
my
first
southampton
beer
they
just
started
distributing
to
ohio
ive
also
got
a
southampton
grand
cru
i
brought
back
from
new
york
recently
but
im
waiting
for
a
special
occasion
for
that
one
it
migt
not
rock
youre
world
but
try
one
or
more
next
spring
pleasant
easy
drinking
malt
lager
some
head
pleasant
malty
and
toasty
odour
very
smooth
drinkable
and
summer
refresher
buttery
mouthfeel
although
the
hops
kicking
in
at
the
finish
can
be
harsh
on
some
sips
the
significant
malt
runs
out
grassy
bitter
aftertaste
my
kids
thought
it
was
tasty
drinkability
was
top
notch
shp
can
do
no
wrong
it
seems
they
seem
to
nail
every
style
they
try
and
make
tasty
delicious
brews
definitely
not
sphs
finest
effort
drinkability
is
very
good
i
just
love
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
brewed
in
the
usa
not
quite
the
hofbrau
haus
but
very
good
quite
amazing
this
was
just
over
4
bomber
from
ny
state
i
got
hofbrau
mai
bock
this
year
for
about
75
of
the
cost

22
oz
bomber
pours
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
consisting
of
mostly
large
bubbles
that
falls
quickly
to
a
full
coat
over
top
of
the
beer
a
moderate
stream
of
bubbles
is
working
up
the
sides
of
my
glass
and
helping
to
heep
the
film
over
top
of
the
beer
there
for
longer
than
it
would
otherwise
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
the
first
sniff
brings
nice
light
doughy
bread
along
with
more
bold
toasted
bread
notes
the
aroma
is
very
clean
with
just
a
light
kiss
of
underlying
malty
sweetness
there
is
very
little
from
the
hops
coming
through
in
the
aroma
to
me
sipping
this
brew
i
find
this
one
is
all
about
the
melanoidans
toasted
bread
dominates
there
is
an
underlying
sweetness
its
not
caramel
but
a
doughy
sweetness
it
finishes
just
as
it
started
with
toasted
breadyness
trailing
off
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
bittering
from
spicey
noble
hop
on
the
finish
i
think
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
though
very
subtle
really
pulls
this
one
together
nicely
on
the
finish
none
of
the
flavors
linger
strong
but
they
sit
nicely
as
they
fade
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
its
not
heavy
but
still
substantial
this
beer
is
really
damn
good
of
all
the
lager
styles
out
there
i
think
that
maibock
is
my
top
choice
and
this
particular
one
is
really
getting
my
attention
the
flavors
are
very
well
put
together
and
i
could
probably
sit
and
drink
a
couple
of
bombers
of
this
in
a
sitting
excellent
beer
alcohol
is
noticeable
though
minimal
southamptons
may
bock
pours
a
mostly
clear
orangeamber
body
beneath
a
fullsized
head
of
frothy
ivory
foam
the
retention
is
very
good
and
it
leaves
some
nice
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
richly
malty
with
a
sweet
bready
character
its
mediumbodied
and
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
and
its
remarkably
wellbalanced
theres
a
delicate
caramel
edge
to
the
malt
as
well
as
a
very
subtle
toastiness
floral
hops
flutter
here
and
there
and
a
spritz
of
peppery
spice
from
the
otherwiise
completely
hidden
alcohol
helps
to
keep
it
from
getting
doughy
one
of
the
most
balanced
maibocks
ive
ever
had
pours
a
nice
peachorange
color
nice
peachy
citrusy
aroma
but
not
much
hint
of
hops
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
rests
nicely
at
the
base
of
the
tongue
and
finishes
well
malty
and
tasty
but
not
very
flavorful
i
like
maibocks
but
still
dont
know
a
lot
about
the
style
so
im
not
sure
how
this
would
rate
against
some
of
the
german
traditionals
but
its
a
nice
summer
brew
for
hot
us
climates
i
could
definitely
put
two
or
three
of
these
away
in
a
short
period
of
time
and
not
feel
the
least
bit
ashamed
by
doing
so
southampton
does
some
good
beers
and
this
is
another
quality
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crispness

hits
up

pretty
goodbut

quickly
and
leaves
no

the

its

giving
this

is
generous
the
taste

this

not
great
but
one
that
will
please

the
drinkability
is
thru
the
roof
for
me
the
perfect
beer
for
the
day
a
refreshing
beer
super
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
a
sunny
and
warm
spring
early
evening
clear
orange
body
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
strings
of
lace
nice
sweet
fruitiness
mixed
with
toasty
bread
notes
come
through
in
the
aroma
sweet
fruits
with
some
biscuity
malt
start
of
the
flavor
toasted
malts
and
grains
with
some
earthy
hops
towards
the
finish
definitely
one
of
the
best
tasting
maibocks
ive
ever
had
smooth
crisp
medium
body
easy
drinking
as
it
gets
i
will
have
to
go
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
this
brew
refracts
light
brilliantly
its
a
beautiful
a
light
amber
color
with
minimal
head
nose
is
maltdominant
with
apple
tarte
tatin
and
a
bit
of
pear
coming
through
on
the
palate
this
one
is
about
malts
primarily
with
a
big
juicy
smooth
malt
explosion
apples
and
pears
again
melding
into
a
showing
of
hops
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
finish
typically
for
southampton
beers
this
one
is
pretty
thick
on
the
palate
goes
down
easy
for
drinkability
but
has
some
good
flavors
as
well
another
winner
from
southampton
this
is
a
fine
southampton
and
up
there
with
double
white
as
the
best
of
the
bomber
series
so
far
poured
an
orangecrimson
color
that
was
translucent
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
high
level
of
carbonation
with
massive
bubbles
covering
the
surface
some
lacing
was
left
behind
in
my
goblet
aromas
of
candy
burnt
sugar
alcohol
and
cream
the
taste
was
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spice
underneath
and
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
smooth
and
silky
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
sip
malt
flavors
dominated
the
beginning
of
each
sip
but
yielded
slowly
to
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
felt
silky
in
my
mouth
and
would
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
musings
i
had
this
first
with
a
crabcake
sandwich
at
the
sph
and
fell
in
love
the
bottled
version
is
very
good
also
unique
that
a
brew
so
dry
carries
the
sweet
fruit
motherlode
this
one
does
a
new
king
of
the
heap
for
the
maibock
style
very
smooth
very
drinkable
very
tasty
shiny
copper
penny
with
a
tightly
knit
extravagant
lacy
white
mop
aroma
of
ripened
pears
and
crisp
green
apples
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
leafy
green
hops
and
a
brief
drying
finish
a
spectacular
and
unpredictable
may
bock
for
an
unpredictable
month
tasty
this
was
the
first
southampton
brew
that
i
was
semidisappointed
with
and
it
still
was
pretty
good
i
just
had
heard
a
bunch
of
great
things
about
this
one
and
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
again
its
not
bad
by
any
means
it
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
pack
d
definitely
very
drinkable
in
the
easy
to
quaff
sense
not
a
whole
lot
of
big
flavor
to
give
it
that
damn
i
want
more
kind
of
drinkability
theres
nothing
here
not
to
like
its
on
point
malty
and
hoppy
as
expected
but
the
truth
is
its
a
bit
thinner
than
id
hoped
at
the
same
time
its
especially
drinkable
because
of
its
relatively
light
nature
its
certainly
no
disappointment
even
if
it
doesnt
really
jump
out
ill
finish
this
and
would
have
no
issue
with
another
drinkability
perfect
nothing
else
to
say
this
bottle
was
quaffed
rather
quickly
for
the
style
go
out
and
get
some
and
im
getting
some
more
beautiful
goldencopper
color
and
very
clear
extremely
small
head
with
average
retention
the
aroma
had
a
little
fruit
qualities
in
it
which
didnt
really
seem
to
fit
the
beer
apple
nice
malty
front
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
the
beer
is
a
little
spicy
and
drier
than
i
expected
very
low
hop
presence
but
theyre
certainly
there
nice
balance
and
a
mediumlight
body
in
my
opinion
the
beer
could
have
stood
for
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
especially
given
the
style
its
quite
drinkable
though
and
i
did
thoroughly
enjoy
it
pours
a
soft
copper
and
topped
with
a
thick
head
of
small
offtan
bubbles
with
ample
divots
the
head
slowly
settles
leaving
a
few
strands
of
lacing
there
are
only
a
handful
of
carbonation
streams
present
the
smell
is
lightly
malted
with
some
biscuit
and
crisp
crunchy
fruit
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
the
smell
undergoes
a
subtle
change
to
include
a
distinct
apple
juice
note
the
taste
is
rich
and
lush
with
malt
slightly
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
up
front
giving
way
to
a
nice
gentle
hop
finish
that
is
punctuated
with
a
bit
of
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavors
are
well
meshed
gets
even
better
as
it
warms
above
cellar
temp
medium
body
with
a
velvety
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
as
silk
a
wonderful
beer
and
well
worth
trying
ahh
this
fine
brew
is
more
than
refreshing
it
is
an
experience
niicely
malted
this
maibock
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
out
of
the
bottle
the
head
is
nice
but
not
long
lasting
with
a
seemingly
somewhat
low
carbonation
the
smell
is
a
malty
sledge
hammer
to
the
nostrils
a
very
sweet
come
hither
the
taste
is
pleasantly
malty
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
beneath
a
very
nice
beer
worth
searching
out
and
enjoying
i
regret
that
i
did
not
buy
more
buy
some
before
i
buy
them
all
up
ps
looking
at
my
overall
number
is
deceiving
look
at
the
taste
and
drinkability
to
know
where
it
is
at
for
this
beer
i
expected
a
light
grainy
malt
presence
from
the
nose
but
instead
i
get
a
strong
roasted
malt
presence
right
off
the
bat
some
sweetness
up
front
too
which
finishes
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
mixed
with
a
sweet
biscuity
malt
after
the
brew
leaves
my
mouth
a
rich
toasted
flavor
remains
encouraging
me
to
take
another
sip
this
is
quite
an
impressive
brew
and
i
recommend
grabbing
some
from
the
pub
or
anywhere
you
may
see
this
well
crafted
beverage
shared
a
growler
of
this
seasonal
with
greatpondbrewer
and
i
must
say
that
southampton
has
a
winner
im
not
a
lager
drinker
for
sure
but
this
could
almost
convert
me
it
pours
a
dark
amber
highlighted
with
reds
and
golds
and
it
has
a
frothy
bubbly
creamcolored
head
there
was
very
little
lacing
as
the
head
receded
quickly
to
the
nose
it
is
sweet
and
clean
but
not
terribly
distinctive
however
the
taste
is
much
better
i
noted
its
sweetness
to
be
sure
but
theres
some
subtle
smokiness
in
the
undercarriage
and
after
a
while
the
peanut
taste
becomes
more
apparent
also
i
notice
cloves
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
there
is
virtually
no
carbonation
give
this
a
go
frankly
the
taste
alone
is
worth
it
64oz
growler
from
half
time
poured
an
amber
bordering
on
golden
color
loose
offwhite
head
on
top
that
receded
into
bubbles
and
foam
smell
was
slightly
clovey
and
banana
like
with
notes
of
juicy
fruit
flavors
as
well
taste
started
off
with
more
of
those
traditional
bock
characteristics
of
cloves
and
sweet
autumn
spices
and
banana
esters
but
half
way
through
the
taste
it
morphs
to
a
more
biscuity
toasty
flavor
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
with
less
carbonation
lack
the
cleaness
of
a
traditional
lager
beer
but
make
up
for
it
with
an
increased
complexity
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
sip
on
a
cooler
spring
night
side
by
side
comparison
with
the
smutty
maibock
and
this
one
came
out
the
big
winner
pour
is
dark
golden
amber
with
lots
of
white
head
and
some
larger
bubbles
with
a
fair
bit
of
lace
nose
is
heavily
malted
and
a
bit
stale
lots
of
caramel
malts
overly
toasted
lots
of
sugar
taste
follows
suit
a
little
less
stale
way
too
much
sugar
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
toasted
grains
very
little
hop
profile
and
no
clean
grains
syrupy
feel
soft
carb
too
big
and
full
overall
decent
drinkable
fare
overall
the
malt
body
is
leading
the
way
no
doubt
i
would
love
that
dialed
back
a
touch
so
the
hops
could
shine
through
a
little
brighter
an
interesting
interpretation
on
the
style
but
i
can
dig
it
very
good
lager
slight
sweetness
to
it
a
nice
light
lager
with
a
bit
of
taste
very
smooth
mouth
feel
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
an
average
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
hops
and
yeast
the
taste
is
unique
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
certainly
there
is
room
for
improvement
but
this
is
fairly
decent
and
worth
a
try
especially
from
a
brewery
you
dont
hear

whole
lot
about

i
search
out

to
find

is
ok

to

to
be

i
liked
this
beer
overall
because
it
was
a
decent
lager
and
had
some
really
nice
bready
malty
qualities
however
it
was
too
hoppy
for
a
traditional
germanstyle
bock
bier
the
alcohol
level
was
decent
for
the
style
first
impression
is
of
the
carbonation
which
runs
very
high
slightly
soured
pale
malt
flavor
with
a

bitterness
as
a
counterpoint
easy

a

with

and
a

of

and
mildly
bready
malt
wheat
lightly
tart
lemon
and
apple
juice
finishing
with
biscuit
and
european
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
medium
bodied
an
interesting
take
on
a
bock
style
beer
more
similar
in
profile
to
a
biscuity
lager
but
with
light
german
bock
flavors
woven
into
the
taste
at
first
the
lagerish
malt
and
hops
are
unexpected
from
a
bock
somewhat
drier
but
the
flavor
is
intriguing
and
pleasant
although
it
is
not
really
to
style
this
beer
has
suggestions
towards
the
original
maibock
while
presenting
its
own
malty
flavors
drier
and
less
sweet
than
a
typical
maibock
but
an
enjoyable
beer
as
the
beer
opened
up
in
the
glass
a
pleasant
floral
element
developed
in
the
hop
finish
this
is
everything
a
bright
bock
should
be
grain
driven
clear
pale
golden
in
color
heady
dense
clean
finishing
and
bready
as
the
authentic
german
editions
but
it
is
also
some
things
it
shouldnt
be
semisweet
overly
filling
and
expensive
lager
yeast
marries
well
with
robust
grain
maybe
some
wheat
but
definitely
german
pale
malt
and
the
result
is
a
decidedly
malty
and
heavy
light
beer
carbonated
like
its
namesake
literally
demands
but
still
filling
and
heavy
to
drink
a
lot
of
not
as
clean
finishing
as
others
and
while
the
lager
yeast
tries
its
hardest
the
residual
sugar
is
still
there
in
enough
concentration
to
make
this
even
more
filling
i
like
american
made
bocks
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
as
they
go
with
a
nice
nod
to
tradition
but
its
not
quite
as
clean
as
it
should
be
and
its
rather
pricey
at
9
bucks
a
go
the
taste
is
very
good
nice
crisp
malt
with
white
grape
and
peppery
hop
flavor
with
toasted
notes
and
mild
hints
of
raw
almond
and
bread
crumb
flavors
with
nice
grainy
taste
adding
toasted
accent
with
some
hop
spice
lingering
and
a
low
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
overall
i
really
loved
the
taste
complexity
and
shear
ease
of
drinkability
a
nice
looking
beer
that
doesnt
quite
followup
with
taste
aroma
or
feel
there
is
just
there
barest
hint
of
toasted
malt
but
its
strongly
overshadowed
with
a
brazen
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
comes
across
coarsely
drinkable
barely
but
definitely
unbalanced
and
unrefined
500
ml

in
a

the

pours
a
hazy

with
about
an
inch
offwhite

head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a

nice
the

smells

breadygrainy
malt
floral
hops
toffee
and
some
fruitiness
i
think
this
taste
is
mostly
like
the
aroma

theres
also
some
honey
nuts
and
light
citrus
flavors
noticeable
too

is
medium
its

buy
it
again
in

nothing
earth
shattering
or

blowing
oa
maibock
review
in
november
oh
well
as
i
mentioned
above
this
brew
has
a
slightly
odd
and
random
assortment
of
flavors
some
of
which
fit
the
traditional
profile
for
the
style
and
some
of
which
dont
there
is
potential
here
for
a
nice
interesting
drinkable
maibock
and
this
brew
was
worth
a
try
but
voku
hila
isnt
quite
where
it
needs
to
be
for
mass
consumption
o
it
was
listed
as
a
strong
lager
there
not
bad
o
a
bit
uneven
in
spots
but
worth
a
look
drinkable
if
i
ever
own
goats
im
gonna
make
sure
they
have
mohawks
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
sunset
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
wheat
mild
grass
flowers
light
honey
and
a
touch
of
sweet
oatmeal
honestly
there
are
certain
sniffs
that
elicit
memories
of
honey
nut
cheerios
only
positively
considering
i
dislike
the
cereal
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
candied
orange
peel
light
powdered
sugar
and
a
light
kiss
of
red
apple
skin
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dryingish
finish
overall
a
solid
enjoyable
helles
bock
one
that
follows
tradition
to
a
point
then
proceeds
down
its
own
path
we
need
more
of
that
in
our
beer
lives
o
as
with
most
local
option
beers
im
sure
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
a
recreation
of
some
long
lost
style
or
recipe
however
while
this
beer
is
drinkable
its
not
particularly
enjoyable
and
probably
should
have
been
left
to
the
ages
o
much
more
beer
than
i
expected
to
come
from
this
bottle
an
imperial
lager
if
there
ever
was
one
thankfully
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
example
of
a
bold
helles
lager
i
have
a
hard
time
comparing
this
to
any
other
beers
ive
ever
tried
maybe
thats
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
it
so
much
wow
this
is
a
bad
lager
basically
everything
is
wrong
i
dont
know
what
they
were
thinking
when
making
this
avoid
o
this
beer
seems
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
maibocks
because
it
seems
lighterbodied
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
does
taste
quite
authentic
however
ive
had
much
worse
american
lager
attempts
where
the
beer
lacks
the
authentic
taste
of
bavaria
it
seems
rather
inspired
by
those
brewing
traditions
but
uses
common
grains
and
techniques
that
are
known
to
u
s
microbreweries
but
regardless
of
its
authenticity
its
a
welcome
taste
in
my
glass
to
usher
in
spring
now
bring
on
warmer
weather
one
of
my
favorites
while
spending
time
at
hair
of
the
dog
very
fruity
and
refreshing
taste
by
far
the
lightest
looking
beer
i
had
tried
tastes
of
very
sweet
fruits
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
very
smooth
hiding
the
alcohol
goldish
cloudy
color
but
brighter
and
thinner
looking
than
usual
very
satisfying
tried
in
a
flight
sampler
the
toasted
grain
character
on
the
palate
does
make
this
beer
unique
less
sweet
than
most
theres
a
blend
of
toffee
grain
honey
and
toast
the
midpalate
has
a
moderate
hoppiness
mildly
earthy
and
a
touch
minty
mildly
sweet
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
outstandingly
soft
and
creamy
on
the
palate
very
nice
stuff
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
some
perfumelike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
enough
beer
but
given
the
other
options
at
the
tasting
room
its
kind
of
hard
to
imagine
ordering
this
again
a
very
well
done
maibock
easily
my
favorite
i
have
tried
of
the
style
and
something
i
hope
is
brewed
regularly
this
was
a
real
tasty
maibock
nice
and
refreshing
with
nice
depth
on
both
the
aromas
and
feel
o
very
different
flavors
here
but
they
are
very
very
welcoming
glad
i
caught
this
fruity
citrusy
one
on
tap
o
quite
the
lager
and
certainly
not
what
you
might
expect
heading
in
even
if
it
is
a
maibock
particularly
where
it
comes
to
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
theres
a
really
good
mesh
between
the
nose
and
the
tongue
and
im
sure
this
is
going
to
be
a
regular
on
my
visits
to
the
taproom
assuming
its
not
a
oneoff
what
surprised
me
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
full
the
body
was
after
a
few
bluedots
i
expected
this
one
to
go
down
like
water
it
was
very
full
bodied
and
had
a
very
nice
earthiness
taste
to
it
quite
unique
as
is
all
hod
beers
im
no
expert
in
the
style
but
this
was
excellent
very
glad
i
got
to
tryadd
this
one
to
the
database
wow
very
nice
and
clean
pleasantly
surprised
drinks
like
a
more
complex
pilsner
o
very
enjoyable
and
very
nice
example
of
the
style
by
an
american
brewery
i
have
been
fortunate
to
live
in
states
with
breweries
that
do
great
example
of
the
classic
german
styles
twice
now
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
one
to
grab
again
on
tap
at
the
brewery
on
its
2015
release
day
very
bright
looking
with
just
a
finger
width
of
head
smells
bready
sweet
tastes
great
sweet
and
slightly
grassy
nice
biscuity
flavor
faint
hops
but
just
enough
slightly
dry
finish
very
clean
well
done
and
on
point
for
the
style
o
this
beer
would
be
fantastic
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
but
with
more
complexity
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
per
the
bas
request
i
was
to
drink
it
with
spicy
food
but
i
was
curious
and
it
was
almost
time
to
hit
the
bed
solid
offering
on
tap
at
carolina
beer
company
in
the
charlotte
airport
pours
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
malty
bready
with
some
grass
that
carries
over
into
the
taste
but
theres
some
really
nice
fruit
and
sweetness
that
comes
through
medium
mouth
first
of
this
style
for
me
so
maybe
im
overestimating
this
one
but
its
really
nice
gold
color
with
a
slight
head
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
toasted
malt
aroma
with
a
pilsner
quality
to
it
light
peppery
hop
aroma
some
spiciness
in
the
flavor
dry
mouthful
but
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
good
block
that
is
on
point
for
the
style
nice
to
see
more
american
breweries
attempting
this
style
exactly
one
month
old
todaybottled
on
41713
poured
into
a
half
liter
stein
a
clear
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
great
looking
blooming
white
crownalmost
specially
made
for
the
glassware
used
the
aromas
are
a
little
different
than
what
iam
used
to
when
it
comes
to
a
maibockno
big
sweet
doughy
notes
but
a
crispness
with
mild
caramel
notes
underneathits
malty
but
not
alcoholic
flavors
of
wet
grain
and
some
caramel
sweetnessagain
the
crispness
is
what
stands
out
most
to
me
not
what
iam
used
to
in
a
maibock
but
its
well
made
and
the
crispness
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
lighter
maibock
but
it
goes
down
easy
o
true
to
style
if
a
shade
light
on
the
hops
wellcrafted
clean
and
refreshing
a
very
good
lighter
lager
with
great
flavor
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
a
solid
beer
overall
nice
clean
flavors
and
aromas
with
a
light
hoppiness
served
from
tap
into
a
sierra
nevada
shaker
poured
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
subtle
banana
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
wheat
and
grain
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
brew
this
one
was
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
road
in
my
opinion
it
did
have
a
lot
of
nice
things
going
for
it
but
it
was
close
to
all
of
the
brews
in
this
style
and
didnt
stand
out
at
all
unfortunately
i
would
suggest
this
one
to
noncraft
drinkers
or
fans
of
the
style
without
a
doubt
but
i
would
hesitate
to
recommend
it
to
a
hardcore
enthusiast
o
very
solid
good
looks
good
aroma
very
good
taste
might
have
to
mix
this
one
into
the
rotation
had
on
tap
at
macs
speedshop
pours
a
really
nice
golden
color
with
a
solid
two
fingers
worth
of
head
the
nose
is
clean
and
lightly
floral
with
hints
of
apricot
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
nice
effervescent
carbonation
taste
is
bright
and
clean
and
finishes
slightly
sweet
overall
a
really
refreshing
spring
seasonal
from
a
great
local
brewery
o
awesome
across
the
board
früh
bock
is
perfect
for
spring
and
summer
and
would
easily
convert
bmc
drinkers
to
craft
a
delicious
gateway
beer
if
i
may
o
a
very
nice
flavorful
maibock
overall
a
refreshing

pours
golden
clear
and
has
nice
foamy
head
there
is
a
very
heavy
malt
flavor
i
taste
a
little
more
sweetness
than
i
prefer
but
there
is
a
nice
bitter
bite
maybe
some
herbal
and
dirty
aspects
i
taste
a
little
more
booze
than
in
other
omb
offerings
this
is
a
solid
spring
seasonal
lovin
this
beer
a
lot
a
well
rounded
helles
bock
more
proof
that
omb
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
usa
imo
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
thick
yellowish
white
head
with
a
ton
of
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
yeast
bread
a
little
hops
tastes
very
sweet
and
grainy
almost
fruity
mouthfeel
is
great
olde
meck
are
the
masters
of
this
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
good
for
a
style
i
do
not
often
care
for
i
dont
know
what
was
going
on
with
that
butterscotch
effect
in
the
nose
maybe
something
with
the
diacetyl
developed
from
being
stored
in
the
growler
but
for
the
most
part
this
was
a
tasty
crisp
and
easy
drinking
take
on
the
maibock
another
good
effort
here
from
the
omb
this
is
just
good
beer
not
as
refined
and
delicious
as
the
copper
maybe
but
better
than
the
dunkel
and
a
good
example
of
an
underbrewed
style
highly
recommended
most
noncraft
brewers
seem
to
dig
this
just
fine
yet
another
outstanding
beer
by
olde
meck
this
one
is
just
so
drinkable

nearly

will

wonderful

balanced
by
some

what
a
pleasant
herbal

that
is
perfectly

the
taste
this
has

to
be
one

the

try
it
o
its
ok
maybe
i
dont
like
the
style
but
this
is
one
i
wont
revisit
overall
this
is
a
solid
dark
lager
that
should
appeal
to
fans
of
a
straightup
bock
its
accessible
without
being
boring
and
is
definitely
priced
fairly
usually

i
like
this
more
than
narragansetts
original
lager
which
i
like
would
drink
again
o
surprisingly
good
it
lacks
some
qualities
but
this
is
a
good
beer
for
both
you
and
your
dad
enough
oomph
for
the
craft
beer
drinker
and
plain
enough
for
the
casual
beer
drinker
plus
it
come
in
16
oz
pounders
and
those
are
incredible
goes
down
easy
and
does
give
a
taste
of
spring
during
this
thaw
low
price
cans
this
was
a
nice
find
and
my
first
beer
ive
had
in
maine
it
was
warming
and
very
tasty
with
a
good
malt
sweetness
and
body
all
nicely
complimented
with
a
wellbalanced
hop
presence
it
was
worth
the
two
cans
i
had
to
wash
down
my
lobsterstuffed
haddock
at
warrens
lobster
restaurant
in
kittering
maine
ah
but
this
would
be
an
excellent
lager
on
its
own
merits
the
taste
has
a
semisweet
grainy
and
caramel
malty
note
with
a
solid
bitterness
tagging
itself
onto
the
end
the
bitterness
was
what
impressed
me
the
most
because
it
felt
so
well
balanced

well
worth
the
effort
to
find
it
love
the
can
graphics
too
see
it
buy
it
another
solid
offering
from
this
brewery
never
had
a
canned
bock
beer
before
and
in
spite
of
the
metallic
notes
in
the
aroma
this
is
a
rustic
raw
and
satisfying
take
on
the
style
and
quite
easy
to
drink
even
with
its
strong
malt
focus
for
a
style
i
barely
drink
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
notes
unbelievably
tasty
im
going
back
to
the
store
tonight
for
more
it
was
difficult
to
find
this
beer
excellent
new
england
beer
and
rebrewing
of
a
classic
overall
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
maibocks
but
this
is
a
good
start
very
impressed
with
this
canned
beer
from
gansett
good
stuff
found
this
at
a
beverage
store
just
off
monument
square
in
portland
me
the
beer
pours
a
crisp
clear
amber
color
with
lots
of
reddish
notes
there
is
very
little
foam
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
roasty
malts
and
lots
of
warm
bready
very
nice
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
mirrors
the
nose
in
lots
of
roasty
malt
and
bready
goodness
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
the
price
and
a
not
so
common
style
big
props
to
narragansett
for
making
a
very
nice
example
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
has
promise
as
most
of
the
traditional
bock
characteristics
are
present
but
it
has
some
off
notes
that
detract
terribly
from
the
overall
flavor
its
still
drinkable
even
if
i
am
a
bit
distracted
i
will
probably
avoid
this
in
the
future
overall
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
certainly
want
to
pick
up
some
more
of
these
would
recommend
it
to
any
bock
fan
overall
this
is
decent
fare
and
for
the
price
and
size
not
to
mention
the
6
5
abv
good
value
its
also
very
drinkable
and
smooth
with
nice
layers
of
grains
and
sugars
in
the
end
however
its
rather
light
coming
across
not
as
watery
but
simply
weak
the
flavors
fading
out
quickly
over
the
course
of
even
a
few
sips
this
is
not
to
say
that
its
bad
beer
but
that
a
few
more
handfuls
of
grains
in
the
mash
would
have
certainly
gone
over
well
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
lite
but
still
very
soft
and
complex
in
flavor
gansett
just
nails
it
every
year
with
this
one
just
attempted
to
drink
a
can
of
this
stuff
and
i
could
not
do
it
had
a
harshness
to
it
and
a
good
bit
of
diacetyl

well

disappears
midpalate
but
then
peppery
hop
bitterness
returns
for
the
finish
slightly
floral
and
perfumey
lingering
honey
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
nicely
carbonated
feel
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
when
you
consider
the
price
and
abv
it
is
a
must
try
incase
you
are
looking
for
another
beer
for
those
kind
of
weekendsfamily
gatheringswhatever
i
am
usually
pretty
satisifed
with
naragansett
but
they
missed
the
mark
with
this
beer
doesnt
really
resemble
a
helles
bock
narragansett
bock
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
from
a
sixteen

tall

the
aroma
is
bready
and
malty
which
is
quite
pleasant
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
hits
me
up
front
when
i
take
my
first
sip
there
is
a
nice
malty
backbone
there
is
nice
lacing
as
the
head
collapses
quite
drinkable
if
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
medium
full

with

somewhat
warming
pretty
smooth
too
id
have
again
despite

for
sure
this
is
one
i
will
be
sure
to
restock
each
and
every
spring
poured
from
the
can
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
orange
colored
body
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
head
a
promising
start
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
aroma
then
it
all
goes
downhill
from
here
flavor
was
pretty
mediocre
malty
with
nothing
else
showing
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
nasty
sticky
and
medicinelike
leaves
a
gross
vegetable
flavor
on
my
palate
that
i
cannot
remove
not
a
pleasure
at
all
to
drink
struggled
with
finishing
just
half
a
can
not
good
o
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
that
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
despite
being
a
little
fullerbodied
o
this
is
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
found
the
beer
to
be
quite
delicious
and
definitely
a
great
value
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
o
this
beer
will
surprise
you
pleasantly
its
good
to
see
gansett
branching
out
into
some
legit
craft
beer
this
is
not
anything
like
picking
up
a
genny
bock
beer
as
this
one
genuinely
reflects
the
style
and
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
flavor
packed
into
a
simple
package
keep
it
up
poured
from
a
tallboy
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
ambertinted
copper
coloring
with
a
thin
foamy
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
as
it
settles
aromas
of
sugary
sweet
malt
toasted
grains
and
a
tangy
nutty
sweet
highlight
flavors
are
rich
and
robust
with
a
strong
caramel
and
toffee
malt
presence
throughout
giving
rise
to
a
roasted
and
slightly
peppery
undertone
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
slightly
cloying
with
a
slightly
boozey
and
nutty
highlight
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
with
all
of
the
sweet
characteristics
throughout
the
palate
decent
bock
not
bad
an
enjoyable
spring
bock
i
wish
the
sweetness
was
balanced
with
more
crispness
or
hops
as
usual
for
narragansett
good
price
for
a
6pack
of
tallboys
9
i
believe
overall
this
is
food
in
a
can
i
was
hungry
now
i
am
satisfied
nourish
me
not
too
bad
for
a
helles
the
body
was
more
full
with
a
solid
flavor
throughout
that
doesnt
seem
watered
down
lots
of
flavor
with
this
especially
hop
oils
and
citrus
surprising
bitterness
for
the
style
but
its
welcome
the
texture
is
a
plus
as
well
with
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
flavor
well
the
creaminess
doesnt
surprise
me
since
the
gansett
lager
has
the
same
quality
but
it
really
just
gels
here
with
the
stronger
hop
flavor
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
maibock
to
me
but
i
definitely
like
it
i
like
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
middling
though
inoffensive
i
would
politely
drink
this
when
offered
but
nothing
id
pick
up
again
mouthfeel
has
a
pronounced
creaminess
to
it
quite
nice
another
nice
seasonal
from
gansett
get
some
while
ou
can
overall
this
is
really
a
much
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
and
definitely
a
good
bock
o
bought
this
with
the
intention
of
it
being
a
session
beer
but
its
a
bit
to
heavy
to
be
employed
as
such
again
very
tasty
beer
nonetheless
and
quite
reasonably
priced
to
boot
notes
very
solid
and
very
drinkable
cheers
overall
wow
a
great
beer
that
i
was
impresed
by
just
a
solid
bock
style
great
caramel
flavors
with
just
enough
hopiness
to
bring
it
back
in
balance
respectable
abv
for
the
money
and
would
be
welcome
addition
to
any
bbq
poker
night
or
game
day
festivity
pay
attention
to
this
brewery
serious
drinkers
take
note
this
is
a
bargain
delicate
palettes
look
elsewhere
celebrator
for
instance
but
you
cant
match
this
much
flavor
for
this
much
dollar
first
off
for
my
money
the
line
of
narragansett
beer
are
the
best
bang
for
their
buck
out
theresix
top
notch
16oz
cans
of
a
good
maibock
for
i
paid
cant
be
beat
poured
into
a
half
liter
stein
a
rich
copperbronze
with
a
large
billowing
white
headjust
a
great
crown
that
settles
into
a
creamy
mass
after
a
short
time
doughy
with
caramel
notes
in
the
nosereal
defined
sharp
leafy

really
play

as
well
caramel
and
tosted
pizza
crust
flavors
with
a

anise
meld
into
a
quite
a
leafy
hopped
up
finish
the
drinkability
of
this
spring
bock
is
off
the
chartsi
have
paid
as
much
if
not
more
for
a
few
beers
of
the
same
style
that
dont
hold
up
to
thisa
great
beer
at
first
sip
and
all
the
way
through
i
received
a
very
off
skunky
tasted
in
two
attempts
i
could
not
finish
the
16
oz
can
i
enjoy
the
porter
far
more
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
certainly
exceed
my
expectations
coming
out
of
a
tall
boy
can
it
also
exceeded
by
expectations
given
previous
negative
experiences
with
bocks
a
beer
as
malt
forward
as
this
could
and
many
do
turn
almost
cough
medicine
tasting
but
they
do
a
nice
job
of
letting
the
malt
be
the
star
without
giving
a
syrupy
sensation
this
is
a
very
successful
beer
and
in
fact
one
i
would
encourage
because
it
is
good
and
because
it
breaks
a
lot
of
stereotypes
o
another
good
value
from
narragansett
overall
impression
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
on
a
whim
and
they
sat
in
my
fridge
for
2
weeks
my
wife
not
a
big
beer
drinker
tried
one
and
declared
she
liked
it
so
i
had
to
try
one
i
loved
it
due
to
its
price
point
the
16
oz
cans
and
taste
this
beer
is
finding
a
spot
in
my
regular
rotation
cheers
overall
quite
interesting
very
enjoyable
brew
an
excellent
bock
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
tends
to
lean
in
the
helles
direction
and
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
dopplebocklike
bocks
out
there
gotta
love
what
narragansett
is
doing
makes
me
proud
as
a
new
englander
even
if
theyre
canned
in
rochester
ny
o
a
fairly
one
dimensional
beer
which
is
both
a
negative
and
a
positive
its
simple
clean
and
has
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
take
a
sixer
of
this
over
their
standard
lager
any
day
overall

0
i
love
that
narragansett
serves
these
crafted
styles
in
their
popular
16oz
size
can
and
prices
them
very
fairly
perfect
for
the
person
with
a
rich
mans
taste
and
a
poor
mans
wallet
smelled
sweet
and
biscuity
well
balanced
with
just
enough
flavor
and
alcohol
to
keep
things
interesting
went
down
so
well
i
think
ill
have
another
narragansett
doesnt
dissappoint
o
i
think
i
anticipate
this
beer
more
than
any
other
seasonal
for
less
than
10
dollars
for
a
six
pack
of
tall
boys
this
beer
is
ridiculous
it
is
just
loaded
with
malt
flavor
and
has
a
surprising
bitterness
to
even
it
out
16oz
can
from
market
basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
good
half
inch
or
so
of
khakicolored
head
sweet
fruity
and
caramel
malt
wafts
from
the
beer
bread
biscuit
and
caramel
comprise
the
majority
of
the
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
a
good
solid
bock
especially
for
the
price
awesome
o
impressive
offering
here
yet
another
solid
seasonal
from
narragansett
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
and
a
point
for
being
very
affordable
and
in
a
pint
can
probably
thier
most
complex
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
and
feel
and
a
very
nice
spring
time
sipper
quite
a
nice
version
of
the
style
very
much
the
same
as
just
about
everything
else
narragansett
makes
in
the
respect
that
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
is
a
damn
solid
well
put
together
brew
thats
got
a
great
quality
to
price
ratio
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
my
second
from
narragansett
and
im
impressed
so
far
with
the
quality
versus
price
of
these
brews
is
this
worldclass
no
but
its
a
solid
choice
i
like
portersummer
better
tho
o
another
nice
surprise
from
narragansett
ive
had
3
of
their
seasonals
so
far
missing
the
summer
and
theyve
all
been
a
goodgreat
representation
of
their
respective
styles
the
bock
is
no
different
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
decent
example
of
the
style
that
should
hook
mainstream
drinkers
im
hoping
for
a
stout
from
narragansett
to
complete
their
seasonal
lineup
otherwise
check
this
out
if
bocks
are
your
forte
another
surprise
from
narragansett
firs
the
porter
now
this
the
beer
pours
a
orangey
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
and
good
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
this
beer
is
sweet
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
an
excellent
maibock
od
its
a
solid
bock
the
old
recipe
was
more
complex
but
ill
settle
for
this
in
tallboys
thanks
to
eddie
for
bringing
me
a
six
pack
of
this
from
trader
joes
in
the
ny
area
last
weekend
as
this
one
does
not
make
pa
yet
i
have
to
admit
that
i
drank
a
lot
of
these
this
spring
it
wasnt
a
breathtaking
beer
but
it
was
very
good
its
a
tasty
bock
that
is
excellent
with
food
the
taste
is
mild
and
malty
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
creamy
bready
is
how
i
would
describe
the
taste
the
finish
is
clean
with
little
aftertaste
this
isnt
my
preferred
style
of
beer
but
this
is
obviously
wellmade
recommended
o
goes
down
easy
pretty
tasty
somewhat
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
rich
golden
in
color
with
amazing
clarity
nice
fine
carbonation
seemed
to
be
leaking
toward
the
surface
throughout
the
session
and
really
get
a
nice
high
head
of
white
going
from
the
very
start
aroma
is
full
of
bready
grains
popcorn
like
aromas
with
hints
of
grasses
and
herbal
hops
well
rounded
clean
concise
just
what
you
would
expect
from
sn
as
i
take
the
first
sip
clean
crisp
flavor
washes
over
the
tongue
rich
notes
of
caramel
almost
clove
like
spice
and
loads
of
grainy
grasses
wash
over
the
tongue
quick
hitting
as
the
flavor
rolls
on
by
a
nice
long
buttery
like
finish
dries
the
palate
and
leaves
you
looking
for
another
sip
almost
immediatly
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
quickfoamy
onefinger
plus
white
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
slight
bananna
note
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
a
slight
bananna
note
and
caramel
medium
body
a
nice
brew
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
this
is
a
mighty
fine
example
of
a
maibock
it
sure
does
got
a
purdy
mouth
do
every
seperate
aspect
of
the
beer
really
comes
together
as
a
whole
here
you
get
the
impression
that
the
folks
at
narragansett
set
out
to
create
something
specific
in
this
style
and
managed
to
achieve
it
very
refreshing
all
the
way
around
will
be
drinking
more
will
in
fact
be
having
to
stock
up
on
what
i
can
still
get
before
what
is
left
is
gone
and
the
summer
ale
takes
over
o
and
did
i
mention
tallboys
this
is
one
of
the
best
maibocks
ive
had
and
just
an
excellent
beer
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
tallboys
and
sells
so
cheaply
only
makes
it
better
i
wish
i
bought
a
case
because
the
2
6
packs
were
so
enjoyable
very
well
done
a
great
spring
beer
do
great
drinkability
this
was
a
very
nice
bock
would
gladly
drink
more
from
a
16
oz
green
can
with
no
freshness
date
brewed
with
pilsner
light
and
dark
munich
and
wheat
malt
hopped
to
32
ibus
with
northern
brewer
and
hallertau
the
beer
is
crystalclear
somewhere
between
gold
and
amber
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
is
easily
teased
above
the
rim
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
very
lagery
clean
and
malty
with
a
dash
of
hops
and
distinct
yeast
quite
malty
on
the
palate
grainy
and
lightly
sweet
with
notes
of
biscuits
fresh
bread
and
a
bit
of
husk
fullbodied
as
well
dry
and
crisp
with
some
apple
esters
light
hops
and
a
dash
of
alcohol
that
leads
into
a
malty
finish
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
that
is
solidly
in
the
hellesbock
profile
its
easydrinking
pleasant
affordable
and
somewhat
local
to
boston
wellworth
picking
this
one
up
it
could
be
a
nice
alternative
to
your
standard
lawnmower
beer
this
summer
overall
this
beer
was
very
close
to
being
a
very
good
bock
it
was
just
the
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
that
overdid
it
for
me
still
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
thats
worth
a
shot
there
is
nothing
like
the
audible
crack
followed
by
the
glug
to
brighten
my
day
this
time
it
resulted
in
two
fingers
of
thick
fluffy
eggnogcolored
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
a
malty
sweetness
underlain
by
a
sharp
peppery
scent
mouthfeel
was
full
not
quite
creamy
but
close
i
let
a
mouthful
just
roll
around
on
my
tongue
getting
an
initial
caramel
sweetness
from
it
followed
by
some
black
pepper
probably
from
the
yeast
strain
finish
was
clean
as
advertised
with
a
literally
breathtaking
dryness
another
winnah
from
the
ocean
state
it
might
be
a
little
big
to
take
to
the
beach
in
the
cooler
but
it
can
definitely
have
some
space
in
my
cooler
overall
it
was
ok
at
best
the
aftertaste
really
killed
it
for
me
a
stronger
flavor
and
i
could
have
forgiven
it
but
not
my
favorite
bock
by
any
means
many
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
malty
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
taste
is
malts
up
front
a
touch
of
caramel
the
hops
kicking
in
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
full
bodied
as
would
be
expected
there
is
a
light
sweetness
but
the
finish
has
a
good
hop
bitterness
wellbalanced
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
would
a
sixpack
of
16
oz
cans
is
going
for
about
8
here
in
new
england
very
affordable
for
a
quality
brew
narragansett
has
done
very
well
with
all
of
their
seasonal
canned
releases
thus
far
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
fairly
well
balanced
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
the
year
and
especially
with
dinner
its
a
nice
malt
alternative
to
all
the
hoppy
beers
out
on
the
market
today
this
is
an
excellent
mild
beer
pours
a
clear
orangecopper
body
with
a
thick
ecru
head
leaves
some
lacing
smells
like
fresh
raw
dough
very
mild
malts
and
a
subtle
herbal
malt
the
taste
is
very
bread
very
mild
and
those
hops
are
still
subtle
i
can
see
a
lack
of
appreciation
for
the
style
but
ill
drink
lots
of
this
nice
bock
overall
in
the
cans
i
got
the
hops
actually
came
through
a
bit
too
much
this
one
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
wanted
a
bit
more
balance
this
almost
tasted
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
tallboy
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
pours
a
translucent
copper
with
a
slightly
golden
hue
and
a
rocky
three
inch
creamcolored
head
that
exposes
dense
concentric
rings
of
lacing
as
it
slowly
dissipates
nose
expresses
candied
fruity
esters
a
faint
herbal
or
grassy
quality
and
a
trace
of
noble
hops
towards
the
back
taste
is
less
sweet
than
suggested
by
the
nose
a
slightly
spicy
character
intersperses
itself
throughout
the
flavor
profile
along
a
light
malty
backbone
culminating
in
a
residual
earthy
hops
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
quality
definitely
one
of
my

a
sixer
a
great
spring
seasonal
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
its
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
sessional
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
exceedingly
drinkable
not
as
sweet
up
front
perhaps
a
tad
more
hops
but
still
very
well
balanced
and
sessionable
not
feeling
the
6
5
abv
as
much
as
last
time
maybe
drinking
beer
with
dinner
is
why
i
still
love
this
beer
and
ive
told
that
to
anyone
whod
listen
lime
green
16oz
can
pours
a
translucent
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
of
head
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
honey
spices
bread
and
a
bit
of
cut
grass
earthy
flavor
has
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malts
more
of
those
bread
and
honey
flavors
malty
earthy
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
mouthfeel
wise
but
still
tasty
overall
once
again
gansett
has
made
another
solid
brew
in
a
tall
boy
i
hope
they
continue
to
make
new
styles
worth
buying
again
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
throws
its
weight
around
a
little
more
than
your
typical
spring
seasonal
this
is
it
ill
have
to
wait
for
a
longer
session
to
see
if
it
carries
the
same
hangover
problems
i
had
with
the
porter
but
this
is
a
vast
improvement
over
the
original
narragansett
bock
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
not
to
sweet
or
hoppy
balance
and
at
a
very
good
price
o
an
outstanding
spring
seasonal
from
the
brewers
at
narragansett
a
wonderful
beer
for
such
a
good
price
this
one
is
a
no
brainer
taste
is
sweet
to
start
with
a
peek
of
fruitiness
in
the
middle
that
promptly
gives
way
to
moderate
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
clean
close
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
good
stuff
this
is
a
really
good
bock
i
love
lagers
and
this
is
a
great
variation
of
the
style
the
beer
is
lacking
in
the
smell
category
a
weak
sweet
smell
is
all
im
getting
from
this
beer
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
however
is
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
bock
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
its
crisp
and
clean
it
has
a
slightly
spicy
finish
that
lingers
long
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
rich
and
creamy
which
i
like
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
will
be
nice
when
the
weather
finally
warms
up
i
hope
they
continue
to
put
it
out
well
into
the
summer
oh
and
the
foam
lasts
throughout
the
session
well
done
brewery
in
rochester
ny
d
high
this
is
a
great
beer
the
taste
is
great
and
the
price
is
even
better
i
could
drink
these
all
day
d
very
clean
smooth
slightly
creamy
wellbalanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
6
5
abv
didnt
notice
this
brew
sneak
up
on
me
until
the
bottom
of
the
can
but
its
deceptively
potent
and
flavorful
enough
to
mask
the
alcohol
with
clean
malt
spices
and
hops
gansett
lager
is
a
standby
fest
impressed
but
this
bock
took
it
to
a
whole
new
level
what
a
great
value
spring
beer
hi
neighbor
just
a
great
bier
and
a
terrific
surprise
a
quality
example
of
a
maibock
good
flavor
right
amount
of
hops
crisp
taste
and
a
strong
beer
with
no
overpowering
alcohol
taste
well
done
this
has
got
to
be
brewed
by
either
trinity
or
cottrell
delicious
and
well
done
example
this
coming
from
a
guy
with
some
years
living
in
deustchland
one
pint
easily
goes
down
on
a
moderately
warm
50
degrees
spring
day
alcohol
concealed
and
its
basic
enough
where
drinking
it
isnt
a
complication
good
job
gansett
odeasy
drinker
abv
hidden
well
drinks
like
a
4
beer
i
paid
a
considerable
amount
more
for
a
6pack
of
pounders
than
i
would
have
if
i
had
bought
the
lager
that
being
said
i
wont
be
buying
it
as
much
because
of
the
price
jack
nevertheless
i
find
most
spring
seasonals
to
be
pretty
lame
this
one
is
quite
good
gansett
is
a
great
company
and
this
one
is
evidence
a
6pack
of
this
would
be
ideal
for
a
warmer
spring
day
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beer
values
6
50
a
16
oz
sixer
no
less
in
the
new
england
area
this
is
going
to
be
really
nice
on
a
hot
day
clean
drinker
that
leave
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
i
gotta
say
this
may
be
one
of
narragansetts
best
beers
since
the
light
and
easily
the
best
of
the
seasonals
not
a
blow
you
away
pure
traditional
german
bock
in
any
way
but
damn
for
5
a
16oz
can
six
pack
this
is
an
amazing
beer
true
to
the
style
still
but
in
a
mildly
macro
lager
sort
of
way
i
know
i
said
this
with
other
narragnsetts
but
this
is
what
cheap
beer
probably
tasted
like
before
prohibition
and
i
mean
that
in
a
complimentary
way
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
great
canned
seasonal
if
any
beer
encompasses
the
flavor
of
spring
its
definiatley
this
one
i
will
be
grabbing
more
of
these
pretty
decent
beer
d
quite
drinkable
narragansett
continues
to
pump
out
great
seasonal
beers
very
shocked
by
this
and
pleasantly
surprised
narragansett
bock
will
find
its
way
to
my
frig
i
do
give
two
schlitz
for
narragansett
bock
if
this
were
available
yearround
in
michigan
it
would
be
a
permanent
schlitz
replacement
in
my
fridge
drinkablilty
my
favorite
of
the
narragansett
seasonals
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
will
be
perfect
for
when
the
weather
warms
up
while
this
is
no
daringly
exteme
beer
it
is
a
well
done
example
of
the
style
and
worth
trying
wow
ill
be
hunting
for
cases
very
soon
one
of
the
best
spring
seasonals
i
have
run
into
in
years
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
dark
fruits
taste
is
the
same
malty
sweet
dark
fruits
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
o
overall
bit
of
a
let
down
its
easy
drinking
sure
but
on
par
with
a
macro
overall
not
good
not
one
i
would
try
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
though
its
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
bock
it
isnt
a
super
complex
bock
if
youre
looking
to
really
go
big
but
makes
up
for
it
with
good
balance
and
being
very
drinkable
so
is
a
good
change
of
pace
from
pale
ales
and
lagers
for
a
everyday
drinker
check
the
inside
of
the
six
pack
for
a
date
after
nov
2012
though
to
make
sure
you
get
the
newer
batches
taste
was
fairly
mild
a
nice
malty
nutty
bock
presence
with
slight
bittering
from
citrus
and
earthy
yeast
notes
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
more
flavor
than
the
bmc
but
nothing
overwhelming
it
is
pretty
weak
in
flavor
for
a
bock
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
golden
with
a
twofinger
length
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
indicating
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
malt
and
fruity
esters
its
bready
and
clean
smelling
there
are
flavors
of
sweet
bready
malts
there
are
minor
fruity
notes
with
some
mildly
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
there
is
a
minor
bitter
aftertaste
the
body
medium
to
full
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
beer
made
in
louisiana
malty
bready
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
some
minor
notes
of
dark
fruit
mainly
raisinlike
herbal
and
mossy
undertones
earthy
balanced
mainly
dry
finish
with
some
residual
mustyearthyherbal
notes
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
an
unusual
take
on
bock
picked
up
a
sixer
at
rouses
i
was
hoping
for
a
traditional
bock
but
ill
takes
a
helles
but
is
this
a
helles
theres
a
mild
cookie
note
that
actually
reminds
me
a
lot
of
heiner
braus
oktoberfest
but
cleaner
theres
a
little
lemon
in
the
finish
but
the
typical
sweet
fruit
and
big
malts
are
missing
this
is
just
pale
lager
with
a
little
extra
malt
o
way
too
sweet
and
way
too
much
cornvegetables
atmosphere
is
ok
body
characterized
by
constant
carbonation
a
quickly
dissipating
head
and
no
lacing
though
nose
is
really
nutty
with
a
pungent
malty
tone
and
just
a
bit
of
citrus
and
floral
hints
flavor
is
very
nutty
with
a
bit
of
a
floral
sweetness
and
syrupy
body
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
thanks
to
tolann
and
her
friends
for
sharing
beers
a
month
or
so
back
at
her
basement
party
this
one
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
corn
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
and
boring
with
flavors
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
corn
wasnt
a
drain
pour
i
couldnt
get
past
the
asprin
smell
the
taste
was
better
not
your
typical
bock
in
any
way
i
dont
recommend
drink
is
not
so
great
the
yeasty
flavors
as
well
as
metallic
on
the
finish
and
adjunct
like
flavors
overpower
so
much
it
gets
tough
to
drink
no
real
booze
and
smooth
but
just
not
so
tasty
covington
brewhouse
is
a
good
brewery
and
this
is
the
first
beer
by
them
that
has
disappointed
me
i
would
like
to
see
them
make
another
attempt
and
create
a
good
heavy
dark
double
bock
i
know
that
they
are
capable
all
in
all
dont
worry
about
this
brew
not
much
for
you
here
maybe
a
good
cheap
sixer
if
you
have
access
dont
hunt
not
worth
your
effort
it
tastes
similar
to
a
kolsch
it
isnt
very
strong
flavored
and
is
best
suited
to
sessions
however
it
isnt
really
watery
it
isnt
bad
but
is
just
a
step
above
the
typical
american
macro
brews
rjt
this
is
not
very
drinkable
heiner
brau
puts
out
some
good
beers
this
is
not
one
of
them
pass
on
it
mediumthin
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
a
nice
grainy
texture
d
drinkable
enough
but
not
craveworthy
unlike
the
pilsner
i
could
pass
on
another
of
this
one
though
the
sessionable
weight
and
goodenough
flavor
makes
this
a
better
option
than
much
of
the
local
options
in
sela
still
abita
and
upstart
nola
probably
could
best
this
brew
4
out
of
5
would
drink
again
will
drink
again
o
a
fantastic
take
on
a
maibock
well
done
recommended
very
nice
beer
slightly
cloudy
when
poured
amazing
nose
with
bready
german
malt
qualities
true
to
type
and
could
be
a
clone
of
a
great
german
helles
bock
poured
into
a
half
liter
stein
a
clear
lighter
golden
with
a
thinner
than
expected
white
head
atop
caramel
and
toast
in
the
nose
with
a
faint
smattering
of
spicy
hops
a
little
lighter
in
the
feel
than
most
of
the
style
i
have
come
across
tastes
of
caramel
and
german
malts
with
a
decent
shot
of
drying
sharp
hops
in
the
finish
pretty
dry
for
the
style
but
lacks
something
to
put
over
the
top
taste
is
lightly
sweet
to
start
balanced
through
the
middle
lightly
prickly
moderately
bitter
to
the
close
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
awesome
pretty
close
to
what
i
would
expect
from
a
rep
of
the
style
in
its
original
land
pure
bourbon
nose
strong
whiskey
flavor
like
a
barley
wine
overall
certainly
a
great
representation
of
the
style
a
nice
malt
profile
that
doesnt
overpower
and
a
hop
compliment
can
always
trust
jacks
abby
to
brew
up
a
good
lager
the
taste
is
great
lover
the
way
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
express
themselves
and
unfold
simultaneously
with
subtle
peppery
taste
from
the
yeast
with
gentle
alcohol
giving
a
nice
amount
of
balance
to
the
flavor
w
mild
malt
sweetness
adding
to
the
complexity
and
toasted
pilsner
malt
character
with
mild
breadiness
and
light
floral
hop
accents
adding
to
the
taste
overall
a
very
good
and
traditional
take
practically
flawless
with
excellent
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
interpretation
of
the
style
wonderful
more
o
just
ok
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
then
perhaps
this
just
isnt
my
style
o
insanely
drinkable
i
could
easily
put
down
a
growler
of
this
and
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
sunny
ridge
pilsner
that
i
had
recently
highly
recommended
but
if
you
want
something
comparable
in
flavor
grab
a
growler
of
the
pilsner
these
were
only
available
in
bottles
at
the
time
of
purchase
if
i
hadnt
read
the
label
i
would
say
it
was
a
pilsner
looks
smells
and
even
tastes
like
one
can
really
smell
and
taste
the
sweet
malt
grain
smells
a
little
adjunct
like
close
to
a
miller
lite
taste
a
lot
better
than
the
aroma
a
little
tart
with
a
slightly
hoppy
bitter
finish
crisp
very
easy
drinker
good
solid
lager
throughout
another
winner
from
jacks
abby
this
one
shows
some
nice
restraint
well
i
just
found
another
jacks
abbey
beer
that
i
will
have
to
stock
up
on
eminently
quaffable
great
taste
need
to
fill
me
up
some
more
of
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
coloring
with
a
filmy
bright
white
clingy
head
aromas
of
fruit
sweetness
roasted
notes
and
winelike
characteristics
the
sweetness
does
have
a
grape
quality
to
it
flavors
of
toasted
grains
on
the
forward
tongue
with
floral
highlights
and
a
subtle
fruit
sweetness
tangy
sweetness
slowly
builds
as
you
drink
smooth
midbodied
brew
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
starts
to
develop
a
grassy
floral
hops
character
smooth
clean
finish
tasty
brew
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aromas
of
sweet
bready
malty
with
hint
of
spice
and
fruit
with
a
light
spicy
earthy
hop
aroma
to
round
it
all
out
the
flavor
holds
a
creamy
bready
malty
taste
with
lots
of
spicy
earthy
hops
to
balance
it
out
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
sweet
mouthfeel
another
great
brew
from
jacks
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
this
brewery
can
do
no
wrong
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
offerings
anyhow
this
is
every
goddamn
thing
i
look
for
in
a
helles
it
tastes
like
light
there
are
dandelion
bits
floating
in
it
dry
sweet
barleycorn
mixed
with
weedy
yellow
hops
and
all
kinds
of
weird
verdant
nodes
soto
exhaust
a
descriptor
ive
been
using
dumbly
for
almost
a
decadeit
tastes
like
a
walk
through
a
field
at
sunset
its
not
quite
as
outthere
polleny
as
new
glarus
dead
gorgeous
zwickle
but
its
easily
one
of
the
very
best
americanmade
examples
of
its
style
that
ive
ever
had
overall
i
wasnt
sure
at
first
because
of
the
aromas
subtlety
but
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
and
really
grew
on
me
recommended
notes
another
tasty
lager
from
jacks
abby
very
true
to
the
style
and
very
drinkable
cheers
overall
this
took
some
patience
first
impression
was
not
the
one
to
go
by
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
interesting
how
the
flavor
profile
works
bitter
spike
that
cascades
down
slowly
to
be
replaced
by
the
sweetness
and
grapelike
flavors
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
german
import
very
tasty
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
not
quite
as
polished
as
the
truly
great
examples
of
the
style
but
certainly
a
worthy
attempt
mildly
sweet
with
a
creamy
touch
the
finish
has
some
hop
appear
as
a
spice
the
aftertaste
features
more
lactose
taste
the
body
is
surprisingly
rich
the
carbonation
muted
a
superbly
refreshing
beer
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
kölsch
than
a
maibock
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
pours
a
translucent
gold
with
a
2
5
inch
rocky
bright
white
head
that
collapses
into
a
solid
18th
inch
cap
copious
tiny
bubbles
are
present
effervescing
in
solution
nose
expresses
grains
and
a
hint
of
grapes
taste
reveals
light
malts
some
fruity
esters
sour
mash
a
strong
noble
hops
presence
and
a
light
lingering
skunky
quality
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
slight
oiliness
and
an
even
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
overall
not
my
favorite
offering
from
these
guys
hops
are
too
forward
and
fruit
is
too
much
in
the
background
in
my
opinion
for
the
style
overall
clean
and
flavorful
but
its
a
maibock
so
its
really
never
going
to
be
that
interesting
overall
this
is
very
nice
beer
and
excellent
summer
fare
the
lightness
and
crispness
of
the
fruits
mixing
well
with
the
breads
and
citrusy
notes
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
heavy
on
grape
and
grapefruit
the
tartness
a
bit
unexpected
and
clashing
with
the
main
mouthful
but
this
is
easily
fixed
with
another
sip
wonderful
beer
its
important
to
use
good
glassware
to
appreciate
this
style
a
stein
enhances
the
flavor
and
brings
the
best
quality
of
the
beer
serve
colder
45f
oddidnt
expect
to
love
this
due
to
the
style
yet
i
will
try
any
and
all
things
from
my
favorite
ma
brewery
obviously
well
crafted
but
not
my
suit
a
pretty
solid
version
of
the
style
remarkably
clean
which
is
the
real
highlight
of
this
maibock
to
craftsmanship
a
overall
a
nice
sessionable
lager
thatis
great
for
the
price
i
have
had
better
maibocks
and
better
from
jacks
abbey
but
i
would
look
for
this
one
again
o
another
nice
lager
put
out
by
jacks
abby
perfect
drink
for
springlate
summer
update
drank
another
bottle
dated
41013
on
5713
and
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
fantastic
german
lager
flavor
super
fresh
and
crisp
and
clean
as
expected
top
notch
for
the
style
especially
from
an
american
brewer
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
this
beer
should
be
highly
accessible
to
anyone
is
delicious
and
simple
above
average
lager
proud
that
its
brewed
here
in
massachusetts
dry
for
the
style
i
love
it
d
fads
in
beer
brewing
are
easy
to
spot
three
years
ago
everyone
began
selling
overloaded
overhyped
overhopped
beer
two
years
ago
everyone
was
screaming
about
beer
in
cans
last
year
began
the
sticky
march
of
fruity
beer
this
year
it
appears
that
lagers
are
the
target
i
like
a
really
good
lager
especially
a
nice
clean
maibock
but
im
not
sure
this
one
qualifies
as
really
good
its
decent
but
it
seems
like
its
trying
to
be
an
ale
the
body
aroma
and
taste
are
all
very
dense
its
rather
flatly
carbonated
and
has
a
yeasty
bready
doughy
grip
that
just
doesnt
have
much
of
a
lager
lean
to
it
thinning
it
out
a
bit
and
jettisoning
some
of
that
yeasty
freight
would
make
it
much
more
attractive
flavorful
and
unique
has
a
great
hop
and
yeasty
mix
liking
this
brewery
more
and
more
by
the
brew
good
local
lagers
very
enjoyable
beer
and
spot
on
for
the
style
1461
m
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
is
also
fantastic
medium
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
ones
a
keeper
nothing
to
say
but
good
things
about
jacks
abby
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
airy
head
very
effervescent
nose
is
quite
sweet
and
filled
with
honey
notes
biscuits
pancakes
wsyrup
palate
is
full
and
thick
with
a
heavy
coating
on
the
tongue
flavors
of
light
grape
skins
honey
grassy
hops
o
a
simple
yet
tasty
and
very
drinkable
brew
it
pretty
much
craps
on
every
other
maibock
ive
tried
before
included
dead
guy
ale
thats
saying
something
this
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
local
breweries
overall
not
their
best
seems
a
bit
of
a
mess
and
they
werent
sure
where
to
go
with
it
booze
and
bitterness
seem
more
than
they
should
be
lager
isnt
bad
but
malts
go
a
bit
in
the
wrong
direction
but
all
things
considered
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
ja
is
an
all
lager
brewery
and
for
the
most
part
theyve
been
brewing
a
lot
of
extreme
beers
that
just
happen
to
be
made
with
lager
yeast
this
however
is
as
traditional
a
german
lager
as
it
gets
id
say
its
like
their
jabby
brau
but
its
not
its
so
much
closer
to
the
traditional
pure
german
maibockhelles
style
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
i
was
sitting
in
germany
drinking
a
fresh
brau
in
a
liter
stine
or
something
just
a
solid
solid
maibock
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
had
they
gone
with
the
maibock
moniker
i
could
have
avoided
such
dread
its
hoppier
on
the
front
but
has
nice
maltiness
behind
it
all
the
transition
into
the
maltier
profile
is
quite
pleasant
dont
let
the
label
fool
you
this
is
pretty
good
pours
a
light
gold
color
white
fuzzy
head
retains
decently
well
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
a
distant
bready
note
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
and
honey
like
notes
reminiscent
of
a
blonde
stronger
honey
brown
lager
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
overall
not
a
bad
golden
bock
here
quite
drinkable
a
light
and
delicate
bock
with
emphasis
on
the
malt
flavors
mostly
light
breadbiscuit
flavors
with
a
barely
perceptible
hop
presence
in
the
nose
hops
do
peak
out
near
the
finish
doesnt
seem
to
meet
the
maibock
description
as
far
as
hop
presence
goes
but
still
easily
drinkable
and
pleasant
o
this
isnt
bad
just
very
bland
for
my
taste
i
did
however
like
the
malty
sweetness
not
the
most
complex
beer
ever
but
still
very
nice
and
very
tasty
notes
nice
easy
drinking
true
to
style
o
has
an
excellent
sweet
malty
flavor
but
lacks
in
other
areas
good
domestic
example
of
the
style
o
an
average
quality
lager
albeit
with
more
flavor
and
alcohol
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
i
might
have
this
again
o
decent
beer
but
very
malt
forward
and
missing
some
key
style
elements
mainly
the
hops
and
noticeable
alcohol
content
totally
worth
the
91
i
paid
for
it
the
body
was
ok
full
and
smooth
not
heavy
but
a
bit
sticky
drinkability
was
ok
the
stickiness
and
alcohol
taste
were
a
bit
offputting
overall
an
average
example
not
great
not
terrible
try
it
or
dont
nice
taste
smooth
on
the
finish
a
nice
taste
all
the
way
through
just
came
off
the
beach
and
this
fit
perfect
lots
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
color
brew
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
bock
i
will
definitey
try
again
im
actually
washing
down
some
snyders
hot
buffalo
wing
pretzels
with
it
and
it
is
perfect
cheers

overall
another
pleaser
from
the
dundee
mixed
12
pack
clean
refreshing
and
delicious
cant
ask
for
much
more
overall
45
rich
yet
pale
quite
a
unique
blend
of
styles
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
medium
bodied
very
smooth
and
slightly
dry
some
nice
biscuit
and
toast
that
is
balanced
out
by
a
peppery
spice
flavor
that
works
very
well
with
the
crisp
semidry
mouthfeel
a
good
execution
of
the
style
and
a
refreshing
beer
d
a
nice
balanced
lager
nothing
bold
or
complex
but
tasty
enough
very
approachable
carries
its
abv
extremely
well
it
seems
more
like
a
5
beer
way
nicer
than
the
usual
macro
swill
excellent
for
the
price
point
o
this
beer
is
cheap
which
makes
it
a
decent
bargain
still
nothing
special
at
all
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
a
dundee
sampler
12
pack
decent
light
brown
color
fairly
well
balanced
to
the
hop
tilt
in
the
nose
good
for
the
style
taste
is
respectable
clean
light
but
malty
could
improve
on
the
yeast
character
which
is
very
light
ive
noticed
in
general
about
dundees
german
style
beers
that
they
are
clean
and
drinkable
but
dont
have
much
delicious
yeast
funk
mouthfeel
is
clean
overall
decent
and
the
12
pack
was
only
10
so
it
was
very
reasonable
the
head
on
this
beer
was
1
and
a
half
fingers
thick
in
a
glass
mug
it
left
long
wide
strands
of
lacing
there
was
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
color
was
amber
i
could
read
the
label
on
the
beer
through
the
full
mug
it
had
a
nicely
ballanced
hoppy
and
malty
smell
the
mouth
feel
was
somewhat
creamy
with
a
sticky
afterfeel
there
was
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
yup
another
gift
from
my
brother
this
one
pours
a
clear
jaundiced
canary
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
dusty
biscuit
light
toffee
light
orange
zest
mild
flowers
and
grass
the
taste
picks
up
the
fruit
baton
and
bolts
emphasizing
the
erstwhile
mousy
orange
and
adding
some
light
lemon
zest
light
melon
and
a
heaping
helping
of
banana
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
lightly
buttered
biscuits
light
black
pepper
and
even
a
pinch
of
clove
its
all
a
bit
much
all
of
a
sudden
and
it
all
sorta
disappears
at
the
end
but
its
not
at
all
bad
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
drying
finish
overall
not
a
bad
helles
bock
by
any
stretch
ill
admit
im
a
bit
surprised
by
it
as
its
nothing
special
to
look
at
and
keeps
some
shady
company
but
ill
never
turn
down
a
beer
like
this
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
way
better
than
the
mainstream
lagers
i
would
get
this
one
again
without
reservation
its
not
from
belgium
or
brewed
in
a
castle
but
it
sure
is
an
excellent
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
an
earthy
floral
type
of
hop
taste
as
well
like
one
youd
get
in
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
actually
this
reminds
me
of
a
samuel
adams
beer
which
to
me
is
a
good
thing
i
can
tell
this
has
a
thicker
and
creamy
feel
to
it
than
their
other
beers
simply
because
its
a
lager
this
tells
me
they
know
how
to
make
a
good
lager
get
this
beer
in
their
mix
packs
dundee
again
makes
some
of
the
cheapest
best
craft
beer
ive
had
o
fits
the
maibock
bill
but
doesnt
excel
anywhere
id
rather
have
a
boss
toms
from
local
brewer
boulevard
but
thats
a
seasonal
it
is
good
and
definitely
worth
trying
but
dont
expect
anything
off
the
charts
in
terms
of
the
overall
blending
it
tastes
alright
but
certain
aspects
of
the
beers
composition
flavor
and
body
could
be
better
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
but
not
too
bad
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
of
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
toasted
and
has
plenty
of
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
nice
body
and
a
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
really
pretty
surprising
another
beer
left
at
my
house
by
someone
this
one
pours
golden
with
a
thin
head
a
constant
stream
of
tiny
bubbles
nice
enough
aromas
of
caramel
and
toasty
malt
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
taste
actually
starts
out
quite
nice
with
more
of
that
caramel
and
malt
flavors
some
toastiness
and
a
somewhat
bready
sweetness
but
it
falls
off
a
bit
towards
the
end
nicely
carbonated
but
a
bit
too
sweet
not
bad
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
tastes
like
its
5
abv
but
the
6
2
really
sneaks
up
on
you
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
its
not
the
greatest
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
different
drinkable
and
worth
the
effort
othis
is
a
fairly
harsh
beer
definitely
is
not
something
ill
be
wanting
again
this
one
really
has
nothing
going
on
for
it
its
not
completely
disgusting
though
again
a
generally
malt
flavor
semisweet
some
carmel
is
hinted
at
but
its
not
cloying
hopped
enough
to
give
good
balance
and
improve
its
overall
feel
nice
clean
finish
its
a
refreshing
beer
and
one
of
those
that
would
be
great
while
eating
with
your
favorite
food
pours
a
clear
litegolden
a
small
white
head
patches
the
glass
many
slow
carb
trailers
looks
good
smell
is
a
clean
honeybiscuity
malt
smells
good
taste
is
a
smooth
toasted
malt
with
a
carbonated
bitter
finish
a
bit
of
mineral
as
well
definitely
balanced
more
toward
the
malts
though
reminiscent
of
a
marzen
a
decent
drinker
my
2nd
favorite
of
the
craft
sampler
overall
pale
in
color
but
it
delivers
in
flavor
i
like
it
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
got
the
sampler
pack
and
by
far
this
was
the
best
one
of
the
bunch
the
two
fingers
worth
of
head
looked
like
a
french
vanilla
ice
cream
cone
it
was
big
rocky
and
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
of
a
shade
that
would
have
made
midas
envious
and
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
very
malty
sweet
just
as
advertised
mouthfeel
was
big
and
full
with
a
honeylike
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
silky
smooth
and
even
somewhat
dry
as
though
the
fermentation
had
fully
converted
the
available
sugars
this
was
entirely
smooth
to
the
point
that
half
of
it
was
gone
and
i
was
barely
aware
of
it
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
nor
would
it
be
very
appropriate
in
the
summer
but
on
a
chilly
evening
in
early
march
with
spring
just
a
few
weeks
away
it
was
perfect
pours
a
clear
copper
with
one
finger
of
white
foam
with
good
retention
aromas
are
typical
maibock
predominantly
sweet
grainy
maybe
a
hint
of
caramel
little
in
the
way
of
hops
first
thing
i
notice
is
not
the
taste
but
the
body
which
is
considerably
heftier
than
i
expected
comes
across
as
mediumfull
and
this
would
be
a
good
thing
if
only
the
flavors
had
the
strength
to
keep
pace
unfortunately
the
flavors
are
highly
subdued
tastes
of
lightly
sweet
grains
with
maybe
a
hint
of
woodiness
neither
note
is
strong
enough
to
be
appreciated
or
warrant
further
contemplation
overall
not
bad
but
uninteresting
d
i
like
bocks
and
this
one
rocks
i
was
a
poet
and
didnt
know
it
yet
another
highly
drinkable
beer
from
dundee
for
the
money
this
is
very
impressive
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
most
of
the
dundee
brews
ive
tried
and
this
is
no
exception
d
a
very
nice
beer
very
drinkable
either
for
a
onebeer
night
or
as
a
session
beer
plus
the
price
is
pretty
good
which
is
also
appealing
im
very
impressed
and
mildly
surprised
by
this
89
cent
brewski
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
its
light
but
full
of
flavor
impressed
for
a
dundee
brew
others
besides
the
flagship
honey
brown
have
failed
to
get
my
jollies
off
a
solid
beer
at
a
great
price
hopefully
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
mixed
12
pack
from
dundee
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mildmalty
a
touch
sweet
taste
is
good
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
not
overly
flavorful
but
tasty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
a
good
quality
beer
started
out
great
and
kind
of
fizzled
towards
the
end
but
for
genesee
breweing
co
a
step
in
the
right
direction
since
dundee
is
a
brand
that
many
trust
due
to
honey
brown
fame
and
with
this
new
profile
of
craftstyle
brews
could
act
similar
to
sam
adams
in
converting
bmcers
to
craftdom
d
highly
drinkable
year
round
this
is
a
brew
that
holds
up
fine
in
all
character
aspects
it
doesnt
have
an
overwhelming
greatness
in
any
aspect
but
it
is
certainly
a
drinkable
brew
this
is
one
built
for
sessions
this
was
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
felt
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
was
balanced
refreshing
and
had
a
nice
crisp
taste
to
it
not
much
aftertaste
to
it
and
went
down
pretty
easily
could
have
easily
had
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
it
was
a
thirstquencher
for
sure
d
very
easy
to
drink
just
boring
d
im
not
a
fan
of
either
the
nose
or
the
flavor
but
it
drinks
like
a
4
not
a
6
so
i
have
to
give
it
credit
for
that
not
something
ill
drink
again
but
it
is
not
undrinkable
nice
head
retention
in
this
maibock
not
enough
maibocks
out
there
these
days
and
thats
a
shame
good
biscuity
flavor
with
a
very
dry
finish
the
copper
color
is
a
treat
to
the
eye
for
sure
i
think
the
one
thing
this
beer
comes
down
to
is
the
hops
its
a
very
hoppy
beer
with
a
warm
finish
its
a
pale
so
its
naturally
a
little
bitter
if
you
like
them
hoppy
this
is
a
clean
dry
beer
that
you
could
really
make
an
evening
out
of
good
two
finger
head
over
a
slightly
cloudy
brew
that
equates
to
a
7
in
color
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
impressive
clinging
lace
with
a
tight
cling
aroma
of
apple
caramel
orange
peach
cinnamon
and
malt
flavors
of
green
apple
orange
and
lime
peal
caramel
green
tea
and
mild
hops
sort
of
patchy
feeling
in
my
mouth
not
bad
at
all
good
for
another
round
and
to
share
with
friends
d
its
not
bad
but
it
isnt
really
anything
more
than
a
pale
shadow
of
a
great
german
lager
overall
this
is
an
inoffensive
but
not
outstanding
beer
a
very
tastey
brew
with
a
nice
hops
finish
plenty
of
foam
from
the
pour
from
the
bottle
to
the
pint
glass
drinkability
and
flavor
rate
real
high
goldenrod
in
color
with
a
slight
haziness
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
and
the
smell
of
pale
roasty
malts
very
good
brew
i
liked
it
the
best
out
of
the
gift
pack
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
i
also
get
a
lot
of
wheat
and
bubblegum
notes
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
grapes
fruit
and
caramel
malt
not
bad
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
better
dundee
beers
i
have
tried
drinkability
very
drinkable
refreshing
like
most
lagers
and
sweet
drinks
nicely
and
offers
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
interest
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
with
ease
a
nice
brew
in
my
opinion
brewery
wise
this
is
one
of
the
best
dundee
beers
iive
tried
it
has
a
great
bronze
body
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
nice
white
froth
head
the
head
and
lace
both
have
some
nice
staying
power
the
aroma
malty
with
some
secondary
hops
aromas
emitting
it
has
a
traditional
taste
this
beer
is
mildly
hopped
malty
and
roasted
it
has
a
mouthfeel
that
is
on
the
upper
end
of
light
d
dundee
is
a
home
run
for
their
teachable
moment
of
craft
brews
pale
bock
lager
is
so
tasty
i
highly
recommend
it
middle
of
the
above
average
road
delicious
if
your
used
to
budweiser
but
not
follwing
a
dfh
ipa
d
interesting
beer
nothing
fancy
just
a
bit
too
sweet
still
worth
a
try
nothing
complex
nothing
for
the
über
beer
snobs
but
this
is
one
damn
good
maibock
this
could
easily
be
a
mainstay
on
our
beer
fridge
yearround
i
say
about
this
beer
what
ill
say
about
all
of
dundees
beers
if
you
want
to
teach
someone
about
beer
by
some
dundee
styles
and
train
them
on
what
are
simple
examples
of
the
various
styles
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
dumbed
down
shiner
bock
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
out
of
the
variety
pack
i
bought
d
nice
clean
yet
with
complex
and
deep
flavors
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
poured
a
very
light
translucent
copper
with
a
loose
one
inch
bright
white
head
a
little
lightcolored
for
the
style
head
eventually
settles
into
a
broken
skim
with
some
thin
bands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
definitely
smells
like
a
maibock
toasted
malt
light
fruity
esters
and
a
trace
of
toffee
and
biscuit
notes
taste
is
somewhat
bland
a
little
bit
of
citrus
comes
across
and
drowns
out
the
light
fruit
in
the
nose
a
little
bit
of
malt
comes
across
the
backbone
but
the
toasted
quality
and
biscuity
notes
drop
off
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
that
lingers
at
the
finish
but
it
ends
all
too
clean
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
the
light
side
of
the
spectrum
with
a
crisp
carbonation
goes
down
easy
but
there
are
definitely
betters
examples
of
the
style
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
is
quiet
simple
though
pleasant
taste
is
dominated
by
balanced
caramel
malt
with
good
sweetness
level
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
though
not
much
in
terms
of
complexity
good
flavor
good
alcohol
i
could
go
for
another
d
nothing
offensive
and
it
goes
down
easily
again
like
the
kolsch
nothing
particularly
impresses
me
about
it
d
well
i
have
a
few
more
and
it
wasnt
that
bad
definitely
drinkable
and
good
tasting
calm
and
clear
golden
colored
brew
small
white
head
tops
it
off
some
lace
clean
lagered
malt
scent
light
pale
malt
some
bittering
hop
pretty
clean
bodied
somewhat
acidic
but
not
too
much
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
a
nice
refreshing
light
beer
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
good
white
head
that
recedes
very
quickly
good
lacing
and
soft
carbonation
caramel
malty
smell
and
taste
is
the
same
with
slight
lemon
hints
light
body
and
thin
texture
short
flavor
duration
moderately
bitter
and
finish
the
same
way
decent
brew
grainy
sweet
with
a
decent
creamy
body
and
a
hint
of
caramel
hops
are
vacant
in
the
flavor
as
well
making
this
pretty
one
dimensional
but
actually
manages
to
be
one
of
the
better
dundee
series
beers
not
much
toast
compared
to
most
golden
bocks
mouthfeel
is
ample
if
unremarkable
not
mind
blowing
in
any
way
but
a
decent
summer
slurper
taste
is
light
and
crisp
assertive
carbonation
all
sweet
malt
with
this
one
not
much
flavor
but
considering
its
over
6
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
day
in
the
summer
just
dont
expect
much
though
a
touch
of
sweetness
up
front
rather
dry
at
the
swallow
where
some
bittering
hop
shows
up
the
aftertaste
dies
off
faster
than
one
would
expect
the
body
is
as
expected
d
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
the
flavors
do
not
call
back
for
more
d
i
could
actually
take
down
about
23
of
these
not
much
more
depends
on
what
is
going
on
i
would
drink
this
while
doing
yard
work
or
possibly
while
viewing
beer
advocate
i
guess
some
may
like
this
simly
because
it
wont
offend
the
masses
but
to
me
this
is
seriously
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
scent
some
grainy
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
and
peanut
butter
has
a
buttery
taste
kinda
like
toast
slathered
in
butter
theres
also
some
grassy
notes
pretty
carbonated
but
its
not
biting
i
really
like
the
feel
but
the
taste
just
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
realize
however
that
this
is
not
one
of
may
favorite
styles
d
well
another
let
down
from
dundee
to
me
i
wouldnt
drink
another
so
to
me
i
dont
think
its
drinkable
mainly
because
ive
had
many
of
the
dundee
beers
and
again
again
i
get
these
nasty
medicinal
tasting
ugly
colored
fizzy
feel
beers
not
recommended
big
and
malty
not
so
much
really
compared
to
bud
light
sure
this
one
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
out
of
the
variety
12
pack
i
never
was
really
a
fan
of
bock
beers
to
begin
with
there
are
a
couple
good
ones
i
enjoy
but
this
is
far
from
one
of
them
its
just
too
bland
its
easy
to
drink
and
session
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
nor
would
i
ever
really
want
to
drink
this
again
avoid
it
avoid
dundee
all
together
cheers
another
pleasant
surprise
from
genesee
part
of
a
10
12
pack
poured
a
medium
copper
with
a
small
head
smell
was
mainly
malt
taste
exceeded
smell
rich
smooth
maltiness
that
was
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
satisfying
could
easily
quaff
more
than
one
once
again
a
very
pleasant
surprise
excellent
value
nothing
really
to
complain
about
although
i
would
like
a
wee
bit
more
hoppiness
in
there
if
youre
just
getting
into
craft
beer
or
weening
someone
off
bmc
this
is
a
good
beer
to
start
with
poured
from
the
bottle
this
had
a
large
head
with
no
lacing
it
was
a
very
clear
light
amber
color
and
looked
dead
the
smell
was
pretty
boring
however
i
could
pick
up
some
of
the
malts
this
beer
had
very
little
flavor
no
balance
and
no
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
off
i
think
it
was
too
carbonated
overall
it
was
not
impressive
and
not
something
i
would
buy
again
d
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
of
there
are
also
plenty
of
better
and
more
interesting
versions
of
this
style
out
there
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
it
this
ties
with
dundees
porter
for
best
beer
in
their
multipack
good
drinkability
i
have
to
think
quick
and
write
fast
because
the
beer
is
disappearing
quicker
than
i
can
review
it
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
slightly
rusted
gold
with
a
inchs
worth
of
eggshellwhite
head
retained
fairly
well
left
little
lace
scents
of
honey
biscuits
grits
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
the
body
was
crisp
and
sharp
carbonation
level
was
a
bit
high
nice
mellow
bready
flavors
in
this
some
mild
bitterness
finished
sweet
and
ohso
malty
this
was
a
surprise
probably
my
favorite
dundee
beer
todate
decent
atmosphere
appearance
is
okay
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
nose
is
a
really
nice
combination
of
tones
flavor
has
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
bitter
components
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
overalli
dig
this
beer
its
a
little
different
but
the
flavors
work
and
id
have
another
good
to
see
this
departure
from
the
nrm
value
excellent
i
paid
less
than
11
00
for
a
12pack
sampler
which
included
an
ipa
a
porter
a
wheat
beer
and
a
few
others
for
that
price
why
not
never
had
a
pale
bock
before
so
i
cant
draw
comparisons
to
anything
there
but
its
a
fairly
drinkable
basic
lager
that
id
gladly
choose
over
more
common
read
macro
brews
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
2
fingers
of
yellowish
head
as
the
bubbles
crack
and
pop
the
head
receeds
and
is
already
lacing
nose
is
slightly
hoppy
and
sulfuric
with
the
malt
tate
is
all
malt
with
a
grainybiscuit
taste
but
is
clean
and
crisp
picking
up
on
some
buttery
notes
in
the
finish
overall
it
is
worthwhile
but
nothing
outstanding
i
proceed
this
review
with
caution
because
of
the
vast
differences
in
brewer
interpretation
on
the
style
of
maibock
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
pale
bock
as
i
mentioned
this
is
quite
decidedly
a
lager
and
its
one
of
the
better
entries
in
the
dundee
sampler
pack
from
which
it
seems
most
people
have
gained
access
to
their
beers
economical
beer
good
crossover
just
drank
it
but
forgot
to
take
notes
all
around
well
above
average
bock
is
a
favorite
for
me
aside
from
hopbombs
so
this
was
no
exception
crisp
golden
color
nice
malty
nose
taste
stays
consistent
with
everything
else
actually
tastes
better
after
about
5
minutes
of
warming
up
on
this
cool
october
day
id
keep
it
cold
in
warmer
times
good
carbonation
definitely
a
session
drinker
as
most
of
this
variety
12pack
delivers
except
for
the
honey
brown
id
have
to
say
it
an
all
around
good
beer
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
very
high
2
head
color
was
a
yellowyorange
smells
of
grass
and
malt
taste
of
cedar
and
woodsy
flavor
detect
notes
of
pine
and
florals
definitely
aboveaverage
drinkability
very
good
session
beer
would
go
great
with
chicken
or
pork
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
my
favorite
bock
but
things
seem
to
have
a
decent
enough
balance
to
keep
me
interested
overall
definitely
not
a
bland
beer
pours
a
honey
color
with
little
over
a
finger
off
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
sparse
little
spots
of
lace
smells
sweet
light
caramel
and
slight
metalic
note
to
it
taste
is
sweet
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
mostly
all
malt
no
hop
bite
to
balance
it
out
light
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
a
long
way
from
my
first
pick
at
the
beer
store
ok
so
hits
with
a
big
malty
sweet
character
that
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
cloying
so
far
a
slight
bitterness
that
was
hiding
in
the
nose
makes
up
a
decent
amount
of
tail
end
of
this
this
is
good
but
average
but
at
the
price
this
can
still
be
a
sound
buy
the
best
part
about
this
brew
would
have
to
be
the
price
factor
you
can
get
it
for
abou
5
99
to
6
99
a
six
that
and
the
fact
that
it
is
a
decent
helles
bock
pours
bright
straw
colored
golden
with
bright
white
creamy
textured
head
leaves
behind
specks
of
scattered
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
a
touch
of
citrus
and
some
fruity
phenols
mostly
a
bit
of
green
apple
with
other
cereal
notes
peeking
through
grassy
herbal
hops
in
the
background
pretty
muted
flavor
a
sweet
honey
coated
biscuit
malt
profile
with
some
rough
graininess
and
harsh
metallic
notes
theres
a
rounded
touch
of
green
apple
tartness
flowing
with
some
of
those
herbal
hops
i
mentioned
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
especially
for
a
lager
carbonation
was
inoffensive
nothing
big
to
report
here
definitely
more
balanced
nothing
cloyingly
sweet
overall
impression
is
that
its
a
decent
regional
brewed
bock
bier
that
i
have
no
plans
of
drinking
regularly
i
remember
enjoying
this
more
when
i
bought
a
sampler
of
the
dundee
with
the
new
labels
these
beers
arent
bad
but
most
are
missing
that
extra
kick
that
would
make
it
really
good
beer
the
bottle
advertised
itself
as
big
and
malty
but
not
so
much
pretty
unassertive
and
average
across
the
board
d
if
i
could
ever
have
this
without
the
rust
flavor
i
think
this
would
be
a
better
beer
actually
i
think
dundee
if
they
upped
their
game
a
little
would
be
a
not
bad
brewery
to
drink
a
little
better
than
average
beers
from
but
hey
we
cant
wish
for
everything
right
unfortunately
pale
bock
lager
is
par
for
the
dundee
course
on
a
positive
note
it
favors
the
upper
end
of
the
gbc
range
in
terms
of
quality
fans
of
the
style
might
want
to
give
it
a
look
but
this
single
bottle
is
enough
for
me
d
once
again
another
decent
beer
from
dundee
nothing
crazy
or
worth
seeking
out
but
not
disapointing
drinkability
far
from
my
favorite

dundee
has
done
a
surprisingly
nice
job
here
overall
this
dundee
12
pack
is
seeming
more
and
more
average
every
time
kind
of
unfortunate
really
note
i
bought
a
variety
pack
12
pack2
of
6
varieties
of
these
dundee
beers
and
besides
the
porter
and
maybe
the
honey
brown
there
was
little
difference
in
taste
and
smell
while
not
bad
they
are
definitely
nothing
special
and
i
was
dissappointed
in
the
fact
that
there
was
little
defining
characteristics
between
the
types
drinkability
drinkable
in
mass
quantities
and
if
you
like
soda
water
this
is
actually
a
very
good
helles
bock
light
and
drinkable
with
all
the
qualities
of
the
style
a
surprisingly
delicate
wellcrafted
heller
bock
that
nails
the
style
right
on
the
head
quite
quaffable
and
very
tasty
a
wonderful
addition
to
the
dundee
craft
pack
and
a
superb
american
interpretation
of
this
wonderful
german
seasonal
specialty
i
didnt
know
dundee
made
a
bock
lager
so
i
gave
it
a
try
it
poured
into
the
glass
to
reveal
a
light
honey
color
the
aroma
was
quite
mild
and
malty
sweet
the
taste
was
also
mildly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
consistent
throughout
the
mouthfeel
was
thicker
than
the
appearance
suggested
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangebronze
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
light
bready
malt
light
caramel
and
moderate
spicy
noble
hops
it
is
a
very
nice
aroma
but
a
little
too
faint
if
it
had
just
a
little
more
pizazz
to
it
i
would
be
mighty
impressed
as
is
it
is
okay
the
taste
is
a
little
more
malty
than
the
aroma
and
the
breadiness
is
gone
there
is
more
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fuller
than
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
could
drink
it
again
but
i
would
put
it
on
the
top
of
my
list
d
its
not
bad
for
a
hellesbock
i
think
by
calling
it
big
and
malty
they
set
themselves
up
for
disappointed
drinkers
because
it
falls
short
of
the
tag
line
however
im
pleased
to
say
that
for
a
cheaper
bock
but
there
are
certainly
better
maibocks
out
there

almost
looks
like
a

and
the
thickness
for
such
a

is

wet

not

it

then
sure
this
is
great
for
the
taste
and
overall
drinkability
with
minimal
malts
and
some
sour
hops
not
enough
hopiness
to
qualify
as
a
maibock
in
my
opinion
nor
do
the
hops
come
shining
through
i
dont
really
think
ill
be
having
this
again

there
is
a
bit
of
tradition
to
that
breweries
would
often
add
coloring
to
their
regular
lagers
in
spring
and
call
them
bocks
this
and
gently
toasty
a
stiff
bitterness
runs
through
it

from
the
relatively
inexpensive
9
99
12pack
sampler
i
had
tried
the
honey
brown
but
thats
the
only
dundee
or
j
w
dundees
product
i
knew
this
one
looked
a
lot
like
the
pale
ale
in
the
glass
clear
amber
with
a
nice
head
of
foam
that
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
almost
imperceptible
malt
in
the
nose
and
somewhat
more
in
the
taste
an
odd
bitterness
hops
was
the
only
other
flavor
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
i
had
hoped
little
carbonation
with
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
poured
a
golden
brown
into
a
goblet
with
a
nice
1
5
finger
head
receded
to
a
cap
which
lingered
for
the
duration
of
the
drink
leaving
scant
lacing
aroma
is
malt
caramel
with
a
bit
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
little
heaviness
great
carbonation
which
balances
well
taste
is
like
the
nose
with
a
bunch
of
malt
caramel
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
relatively
low
abv
and
the
good
balance
of
taste
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
sometime
if
the
price
is
right
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spicy
slight
bitterness
quite
drinkable
indeed
another
nice
offering
from
highfalls
dundee
this
was
an
interesting
flavor
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
so
far
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
out
of
the
mix
pack
d
you
could
have
more
then
one
due
to
its
light
nature
and
low
hoppiness
but
it
feels
like
a
lot
of
other
mass
produced
beers
one
is
enough
for
me
period
this
one
was
suprisingly
decent
deep
gold
in
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
smell
some
sweet
grain
and
floral
and
spicy
hops
not
alot
of
hops
but
some
there
taste
isnt
as
malty
as
i
thought
breadgrain
flavor
with
some
slight
toasted
malt
some
residual
sweetness
hangs
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
with
good
drinkability
i
like
this
one
as
well
as
all
the
others
in
the
mixed
12
solid
beers
for
a
very
reasonable
price
there
has
to
be
one
bad
beer
in
a
sampler
pack
right
i
tried
this
4
times
and
was
only
able
to
drink
the
entire
beer
once
i
dont
have
many
drain
pours
but
this
is
one
of
them
just
way
too
strong
of
an
alcohol
taste
and
the
beer
is
just
not
smooth
at
all
way
too
many
astringent
tastes
going
on
really
not
a
good
beer
at
all
pours
an
orange
golden
with
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
giving
off
a
light
malty
aroma
it
has
a
pleasant
malty
taste
with
slight
hop
bitterness
and
hints
of
lemon
a
sourdough
breadiness
the
mouthfeel
is
strangely
grainy
with
a
sting
of
carbonation
and
a
little
spiciness
clinging
to
the
tongue
the
pour
reveals
a
clear
cpper
wth
straw
highlights
and
a
nice
column
of
bubbles
risin
to
the
top
of
the
brew
the
hed
is
about
one
fingers
width
but
recedes
to
an
island
of
foam
crystal
sweet
white
breads
hit
the
nostrils
with
some
faint
spicey
hops
to
boot
lavors
of
mild
toasted
malts
meld
with
syrupy
fruit
juices
in
this
pale
malt
blast
of
a
bock
some
autumn
like
spces
also
make
themselves
known
in
the
palate
of
this
beer
the
palate
is
a
bit
syrupy
with
the
concentrated
malt
flavors
and
pumkin
pie
spices
just
a
touch
too
much
for
a
regular
drinking
bock
a
clean
carbonation
cuts
the
heavy
malt
flavor
and
lightens
the
overall
body
of
the
beer
nice
combination
to
make
a
completely
enjoyable
beer
drinking
experience
very
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
smooth
good
level
of
carbonation
medium
body
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
wasnt
so
sweet
drinkability
well
its
okay
though
it
lacks
the
depth
of
character
to
continue
my
interest
beyond
the
single
12
oz
bottle
if
you
were
looking
at
the
title
of
the
beer
it
is
definitely
more
pale
than
bock
but
it
works
well
together
the
feel
is
thick
but
also
smooth
a
bit
prickly
at
the
swallow
not
bad
at
all
overall
its
a
nice
substantial
but
darkly
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
better
dundee
offerings
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
you
were
hard
pressed
for
a
bock
and
this
was
all
that
was
available
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
re
michelob
amber
bock
but
still
dundee
needs
to
take
a
good
look
at
what
its
trying
to
do
with
these
scrutinized
styles
i
know
the
beer
runs
cheaper
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
so
obvious
why
in
the
taste
best
offering
from
jw
dundees
yet
although
that
doesnt
mean
its
great
little
aroma
but
i
was
able
to
detect
some
solid
maltiness
pour
is
a
light
to
medium
copper
color
with
an
impressive
white
head
and
good
lacing
full
mouthfeel
bordering
on
the
creamy
side
nice
clean
finsih
with
an
alcohol
kick
flavor
is
solid
has
that
strong
malt
content
that
a
bock
should
clearly
have
this
one
is
more
on
the
calmer
blander
side
for
this
style
but
it
is
enjoyable
the
alcohol
kick
is
there
in
the
taste
as
well
which
i
have
always
liked
in
a
brew
decent
beer
to
knock
back
a
couple
quick
ones
on
overall
enjoyable
but
still
not
impressive
from
a
mediocre
brewery
pours
a
decent
golden
color
deffinitely
something
with
some
carmelization
in
the
color
but
the
head
dissapears
a
bit
too
quickly
the
aroma
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
on
but
a
little
roasted
malts
deffinitely
there
much
the
same
with
the
taste
its
got
a
nice
bit
of
malt
and
not
a
lot
else
a
bit
more
than
medium
in
body
but
still
pretty
drinkable
d
again
about
as
average
as
a
beer
can
get
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
again
but
wont
seek
out
i
have
been
pretty
disappointed
by
the
dundee
brews
d
like
with
other
dundee
beers
ive
had
im
torn
a
nice
beer
in
and
of
itself
but
not
that
great
an
example
of
the
style
pours
a
dull
gold
with
a
three
finger
tall
head
that
disipates
rapidly
leaving
some
spotty
lace
as
it
drops

is
slightly
sweet

the

basic

weak

the

and
not
much
else
again
a
subtle
sweetness
that
is
light
but
balanced
i
guess
its
hard
to
make
something
thats
out
of
balance
considering
what
they
put
into
it
average

too
light
considering
my
idea
of
a

theres
nothing

complain
about
here

being

it
leans
more

anything
negative
a

from

convenience
concord
nh
drinkability
isnt
strong
due
to
the
mild
flavors
you
dont
really
have
a
reason
to
finish
this
brew
i
could
knock
them
back
but
didnt
enjoy
it
too
much
so
i
decided
to
pour
it
out
and
go
find
another
beer
that
id
enjoy
more
why
waste
your
flavor
buds
drink
what
you
like
an
overall
average
beer
reminding
me
of
domestic
macro
brews
but
with
a
kick
as
are
most
of
their
beers
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
smell
that
seems
all
to
malty
and
a
taste
that
agrees
easy
to
drink
and
good
value
but
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
bock
again
smooth
on
the
pallet
and
smooth
going
down
with
no
discernable
after
taste
d
good
drinkability
another
very
good
value
from
high
falls
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
pretty
weak
body
well
it
does
reach
medium
body
but
has
little
depth
for
abv
lets
a
bit
too
much
of
pepper
come
through
overall
not
bad
though
just
mediocre
thats
all
rich
honey
colored
pour
with
a
little
bit
of
white

smell
was
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
actually
taste
was
a
bit
malty
a
touch
tart
light
and
watery
with
an
almost
hef
spiced
aftertaste
and
sort
of
a
dull
tart
apple
juice
flavor
maybe
it
was
a
bit
past
its
prime
as
i
got
it
in
a
mix
pack
but
its
hard
to
say
either
way
nothing
impressive
eric
d
not
an
altogether
bad
beer
but
id
pass
this
by
in
a
heartbeat
for
something
a
little
better
this
isnt
very
too
style
either
this
is
so
sweet
and
thick
that
its
really
almost
a
drain
pour
i
hate
to
be
so
critical
but
i
really
dont
like
this
at
all
pours
a
clear
yellow

color
with
a
medium

that

a

is
sposed
to

the

of
very
sweet

some

hops
but
not
much
it
is
a
very
sweet
beer
like
a
bock
should
be
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
not
a

malty
with
a
bit
of
honey
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
nice
but
on
the
weak
side
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
meh
leaves
me
underwhelmed
im
not
sure
where
the
brewer
was
going
with
this
its
unoffensive
and
im
sure
very
approachable
if
it
was
selling
for
less
then
a
buck
a
bottle
i
would
by
it
for
nonbeer
geek
friends
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
thanks
dad
d
i
could
drink
these
all
the
time
but
with
the
higher
alcohol
content
which
was
evident
you
would
have
to
be
careful
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
in
color
with
about
a
half
finger
of
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
there
are
faint
aromas
of
sweet
crystal
malts
and
lightly
spicy
hops
as
well
as
a
distinctly
lager
yeast
aroma
taste
is
of
some
crystal
malts
a
touch
of
hop
spicyness
in
the
finish
and
a
lager
character
throughout
i
noticed
a
surprising
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
brew
considering
its
only
6
2
abv
in
the
finish
there
is
a
flavor
that
seems
to
be
a
combination
of
spicy
hops
and
has
an
overwhelming
lager
character
that
i
find
very
unpleasant
and
the
alcohol
flavor
doesnt
help
mouthfeel
is
average
at
best
mediumlight
body
and
moderatelow
carbonation
drinkability
is
fairly
low
i
simply
didnt
enjoy
this
at
all
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
a
rice
crispies
crackling
head
the
smell
is
rather
nondescript
grainy
malt
is
really
all
that
is
going
on
here
the
initial
taste
is
a
slight
sweetness
quickly
countered
by
a
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
gives
a
smooth
dry
finish
nothing
too
complex
just
a
decent
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
bubbly
slightly
viscous
carbonation
overall
a
decently
drinkable
beer
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
nothing
really
impressive
either
d
well
not
the
most
drinkable
maibock
ive
tried
still
not
bad
and
fairly
fit
to
style
d
nice
and
drinkable
but
i
might
consider
it
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
it
has
just
a
bit
too
much
hop
flavor
and
not
enought
malt
for
a
real
maibock
last
one
of
the
craft
pack
poured
gold
into
a
nonic
with
a
half
inch
of
creamy
foam
the
smell
was
sweet
and
fruity
it
was
unfortunately
accompanied
with
some
slight
ester
notes
the
taste
was
pleasantly
fruity
and
spiced
with
slight
earthy
hop
notes
moderate
carbonation
danced
through
this
thick
and
creamy
beer
the
heavy
brew
finished
dry
this
was
by
far
the
most
surprising
brew
in
the
craft
pack
one
i
would
definitely
drink
again
but
not
for
some
time
the
problem
is
with
the
metallic
taste
upfront
it
just
hits
too
hard
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
i
believe
ive
had
better
versions
of
a
helles
bockmaibock
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
and
i
didnt
think
it
was
too
bad
i
would
definately
have
another
it
isnt
entirely
true
to
form
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
definately
worth
a
try
drinkability
way
to
go
high
falls
im
a
fan
of
this
one
as
i
find
myself
drawn
more
to
the
bock
categories
of
late
well
done
golden
colored
beer
with
a
almost
macrolager
like
aroma
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
this
is
the
sixth
and
final
beer
in
the
jw
dundee
craft
case
and
i
scored
each
one
as
a
thumbs
up
good
job
by
high
falls
brewery
as
for
this
one
specifically
it
is
something
i
would
buy
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
the
next
was
the
pale
bock
pours
a
deep
clear
golden
color
w
a
white
head
which
dissapates
quickly
some
lacing
not
much
for
aroma
a
kinda
ricey
nose
to
it
some
caramely
malt
undertones
present
the
flavor
is
actually
reminicent
of
the
us
40
malt
liqours
but
sweeter
more
hops
a
little
to
thin
here
too
much
too
light
for
the
style
too
much
carbonation
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
either
the
taste
has
caramel
malt
some
roasted
malt
flavour
some
fruitinesscherry
citrus
and
a
slight
alcohol
flavour
hmm
theres
not
much
harmony
going
on
with
the
flavours
here
and
im
finding
it
kind
of
difficult
to
take
more
sips
nope
this
one
is
not
for
me
pours
out
a
nice
marmalade
with
a
fluffy
little
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
a
handful
of
streams
of
bubbles
lazily
make
their
way
to
the
head
smell
is
pretty
lackluster
with
an
overall
vague
sweetness
taking
over
malt
is
pushed
to
the
back
along
with
a
note
of
alcohol
little
bit
of
vegetable
smell
as
well
as
an
odd
hint
of
stinkbug
flavor
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
suggest
and
the
malt
comes
a
few
steps
closer
to
the
fore
but
accompanied
by
some
graininess
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
theres
a
suggestion
of
leafy
hop
in
the
finish
along
with
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
mouthfeel
isnt
too
syrupy
which
can
be
the
case
with
some
maibocks
and
the
carbonation
is
a
good
lively
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
cant
complain
of
it
being
full
of
defects
or
anything
just
this
isnt
the
most
impressive
helles
bock
around
drinkability
is
ok
id
rather
sit
and
smell
it
though
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveonce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tapglass
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
for
812pack
this
is
without
a
doubt
worth
a
shot
especially
if
your
thirsty
poured
a
dark
golden
color
w
2
finger
head
smell
was
slight
floral
with
a
sweet
fruity
presence
taste
was
surprisingly
good
ive
had
many
of
j
ws
brews
before
but
this
was
really
descent
fruity
flavor
maybe
a
plum
or
raison
with
a
sugar
cookie
taste
that
lingers
not
much
in
the
hop
department
but
caramel
malt
was
nice
mouthfeel
was
malty
and
pleasant
but
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
much
for
a
great
balance
drinkability
was
nice
but
not
the
greatest
overall
an
above
par
brew
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
sample
d
overall
better
than
expected
but
i
wouldnt
want
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
substantial
final
thought
this
is
like
a
jacked
up
pbr
that
tastes
better
and
hits
you
harder
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
case
worth
at
12
what
a
surprise
just
bought
a
brewmasters
sampler
and
never
even
heard
of
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
perfect
and
stayed
the
whole
time
lacing
was
impressive
too
and
the
flavor
oh
yes
the
flavor
isnt
that
why
we
drink
the
stuff
it
was
sooo
smooth
and
very
malty
a
tiny
hop
bite
but
oh
so
tiny
just
a
perfect
balance
of
hop
and
malt
but
more
malt
than
hop
which
i
personally
like
nice
beer
for
the
autumn
i
think
really
liked
this
and
i
still
cant
believe
that
it
was
only
19
99
for
a
case
of
this
stuff
hell
a
few
isles
away
there
were
beers
going
for
200
a
case
this
is
a
quality
beer
in
my
opinion
but
try
for
yourself
if
youre
a
beer
geek
what
the
hell
is
20
to
you
and
in
the
brewmasters
case
you
get
six
different
beers
from
j
w
dundees
six
beers
i
think
thats
great
props
to
you
my
friends
at
high
falls
keep
them
prices
low
and
that
flavorquality
high
very
comparible
with
the
expensive
micros
i
think
a
secret
gem
in
the
beer
world
saaalute
my
ba
friends
overallanother
veritble
bargain
from
high
falls
there
beers
can
be
hit
or
miss
but
when
you
find
the
hit
like
this
one
the
price
to
flavor
ratio
just
cant
be
beat
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
lager
colored
with
a
tam
creamy
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
the
taste
was
slighly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
hoppiness
that
was
just
right
for
me
not
to
hoppy
i
liked
the
beer
and
will
buy
again
high
falls
has
scored
a
very
good
beer
again
their
specialty
brews
have
been
quite
solid
lately
e
g
porter
and
have
turned
me
on
to
these
guys
especially
given
the
price
point
they
and
saranac
are
my
2
fave
high
value
northeastern
brewers
12oz
bottle
from
a
multipack
amber
body
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
is
feint
but
hints
at
malty
sweetness
tastes
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
grain
bitterness
toward
the
finish
lighterbodied
making
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
overly
complex
or
wowing
but
a
solid
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
their
better
offerings
imo
overall
a
pretty
good
bock
good
effort
from
dundees
update
on
852008
much
better
than
previously
it
has
very
good
head
retention
a
more
malty
aroma
and
a
tasty
malt
character
with
munich
you
can
taste
now
not
fabulous
but
a
solid
beer
a
pretty
decent
session
beer
and
one
of
the
better
from
jw
dundee
though
that
doesnt
take
much
da
this
one
is
going
down
pretty
easy
on
this
95
degree
day
62707
but
the
sicklysweet
malt
proves
to
be
too
big
for
another
i
really
like
this
beer
i
actually
think
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
german
examples
especially
when
i
figure
in
the
price
different
small
though
it
may
be
drinkability
the
beer
is
just
too
bitter
and
malty
for
my
liking
so
i
would
not
buy
this
again
had
trouble
finishing
the
four
bottles
that
came
with
the
variety
12pack
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
tasted
more
like
a
decent
macro
lager
than
a
german
inspired
maibock
a
dms
smell
overtook
the
nose
it
also
contributed
to
the
taste
along
with
some
smokiness
and
sweet
breadiness
went
down
easy
and
clung
to
the
mouth
well
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
but
not
something
i
would
enjoy
very
often
pours
an
extra
pale
gold
hue
with
brilliant
clariy
soapy
three
finger
head
shows
good
retention
and
spotty
lacing
clean
nose
some
meek
toasted
pale
notes
and
whiff
of
ester
but
not
much
aroma
the
first
sip
is
a
mellow
blend
of
biscuity
pale
malt
some
toasty
dextrin
and
a
pinch
of
sharp
pilsener
malts
the
accompaning
cider
taste
is
nonoffensive
and
feels
appropriate
as
does
the
mild
but
balanced
bitterness
and
clean
german
hop
flavor
semidry
aftertaste
with
some
degree
of
residual
sweetness
but
an
ample
carbonation
keeps
the
medium
bodied
beer
crisp
and
lively
finishes
toasty
and
rich
with
malt
flavor
and
a
light
apple
ester
in
the
background
j
w
dundees
does
not
seem
the
type
that
pushes
the
boundaries
rather
they
profess
at
making
solid
beers
of
medium
strength
with
respectable
flavor
and
complexity
that
have
terrific
drinkability
and
represent
the
given
style
accurately
and
this
one
is
no
different
an
overall
average
beer
reminding
me
of
domestic
macro
brews
but
with
a
kick
the
apperance
is
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
smell
that
seems
all
to
malty
and
a
taste
that
agrees
easy
to
drink
and
good
value
but
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
bock
again
yellow
color
and
fizzy
but
a
good
golden
tint
to
it
and
the
head
is
decent
enough
sweet
malted
grain
in
the
nose
quite
weak
the
flavor
is
a
little
thin
kind
of
takes
the
complexity
away
from
the
bock
style
some
hop
bitterness
makes
the
whole
thing
reasonably
tasty
i
favor
ales
normally
and
this
helles
bock
is
a
little
light
for
my
pleasure
great
price
very
chiefable
finish
is
somewhat
dry
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
recommend
this
for
people
who
like
a
malty
alcohol
tasting
beer
this
bock
has
a
nice
depth
of
taste
with
a
strong
alcohol
taste
so
you
know
your
drinking
a
beer
not
really
the
best
example
of
a
bock
frankly
and
certainly
not
the
most
fantastic
beer
ive
tried
the
alcohol
is
a
little
on
the
rough
side
its
kind
of
watery
for
a
bock
and
its
just
sort
of
unremarkable
but
it
does
have
some
bright
points
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
amber
theres
a
fairly
tasty
grainy
maltiness
it
features
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
and
its
pretty
drinkable
all
in
all
i
would
say
it
was
worth
it
jwds
brews
are
irresistibly
priced
and
you
probably
wont
mind
finishing
off
three
bottles
of
this
beer
if
you
got
them
in
one
of
their
nifty
variety
twelvepacks
like
i
did
recommended
ive
never
had
a
pale
bock
before
but
this
maibock
is
probably
brewed
to
appeal
to
a
broad
audience
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
at
7
5
you
get
a
lot
of
bang
for
your
buck
i
paid
5
49
for
a
sixpack
taste
is
rich
bright
pale
malt
sweetish
and
lightly
fruity
hints
of
green
apple
some
muted
hops
in
the
finish
strangely
a
bit
dry
up
front
with
a
sweetish
but
clean
finish
really
tasty
this
stuff
is
money
and
its
a
great
beer
for
the
money
check
out
a
sixpack
it
may
take
a
full
sixpack
to
get
this
beer
hell
its
cheap
d
highly
drinkable
as
with
all
other
jw
dundees
a
quality
beer
with
a
party
type
feel
great
at
a
party
to
satisfy
the
macro
drinkers
and
not
offend
your
palate
given
that
i
like
this
style
and
this
is
the
highest
rated
beer
from
high
falls
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
im
thinking
my
expectations
may
have
been
overinflated
while
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
from
this
company
its
nowhere
near
the
quality
of
other
beers
that
ive
had
from
this
style
really
enjoyable
and
considering
i
hate
j
w
dundees
honey
brown
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
enjoyable
this
was
as
others
have
noted
4
99
a
sixpack
for
something
this
good
is
a
nice
supermarket
find
will
be
certainly
enjoying
the
other
five
poured
clear
medium
golden
with
a
nice
forming
one
finger
white
head
but
it
seemed
to
leave
as
quick
as
it
came
leaving
no
lace
behindaromas
are
buttery
and
somewhat
toasted
with
lighter
cooked
veggie
elemant
as
well
quite
buttery
tasting
up
front
with
some
caramel
intertwined
in
there
i
noticed
a
minerallike
quality
more
as
it
warmed
a
little
hops
come
thru
late
in
herbal
spiciness
hey
4
99
a
sixer
and
pretty
quaffable
if
a
little
lighter
in
flavor
and
body
i
am
gonna
offer
to
my
german
father
in
law
and
see
what
he
thinks
jw
dundees
pale
bock
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium

is
bready
and
malty
with

hint
of

taste
is
malty
and
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
offdry
finish
an
very
drinkable
bock
and
at
4
50six
pack
it
is
very
easy
on
the
wallet
as
well
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
massive
white
puffy

nice
lacing
as
the
head
slowly
fell
to
a
thin
coating
smell
is
fruity
malty
and
sweet
taste
greatly
differs
from
the
dmell
with
a
strong
hop
bitterness
dominating
over
the
malt
finished
more
dry
than
sweet
with
a
nice
creamt
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
with
good
drinkability
drinkability

this
went
down
well
and
was
appreciated
by
some
of
the
nonbeer
drinkers
attending
skyhands
broken
fridge
party
overall
impression
very
drinkable
and
well
made
quite
impressive
especially
considering
the
low
price
maybe
not
a
beer
that
will
wow
the
geeks
but
at
around
4
50
a
sixer
a
solid
economical
choice
and
a
tasty
alternative
to
a
bmcer
looking
to
branch
out
a
little
not
a
bad
little
big
beer
drinkability
is
this
beers
strength
dont
really
consider
a
bock
tastewise
the
abv
helps
to
mask
some
astrigency
sweetness
i
found
annoying
in
their
honey
brown
worth
a
try
just
please
dont
tell
me
this
your
favorite
bock
the
mouth
is
a
trifle
thin
but
is
still
manages
to
be
a
bit
creamy
easy
enough
drinker
would
be
easy
to
session
another
nice
inexpensive
offering
from
high
falls
well
to
start
with
this
ones
an
attractive
beer
its
an
extremely
clear
golden
beer
with
a
slight
copper
accent
nice
head
puffy
and
white
lasting
and
laceproducing
the
aroma
is
a
little
underwhelming
very
faint
lightly
toasted
malt
and
thats
about
it
theres
none
of
the
multidimensional
caramel
flavors
or
munichmalt
temptations
appropriately
theres
almost
no
hop
presence
its
got
a
faint
bready
sweetness
and
a
firm
mediumbody
mouthfeel
it
holds
together
pretty
well
but
it
seems
a
little
dumbeddown
in
the
flavor
department
it
seemed
ordinary
and
uninteresting
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
musty
there
appears
to
be
some
malt
sweetness
but
its
very
little
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
grainy
pale
and
carapils
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
sweetness
it
also
has
a
musty
lager
yeast
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
good
drinker
despite
it
first
experience
with
this
brew
and
was
expecting
pretty
good
results
based
on
past
experiences
with
high
falls
always
nothing
extraordinary
a
fair
to
good
brew
at
a
great
price
this
brew
was
not
what
i
expected
i
felt
it
was
a
excellent
brew
and
a
great
price
brew
pours
to
a
clear
golden
color
that
has
amber
highlights
in
it
nice
sized
offwhite
head
that
breaks
down
somewhat
slowly
leaving
a
nice
sheen
of
lace
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aromas
are
actually
quite
complex
rye
bread
like
smell
along
with
slight
fruit
like
esters
and
a
spicy
hop
scent
the
taste
is
very
nice
very
similar
qualities
as
expressed
in
the
aromas
of
the
brew
very
rich
malt
like
flavor
dominates
but
then
the
spiciness
cuts
through
finishing
nicely
a
very
smooth
brew
with
the
abv
at
6
2
i
would
imagine
that
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
because
it
is
very
easy
drinking
exceptional
offering
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
so
truth
be
known
i
am
biased
to
some
extent
drinkabilty
for
a
6
abv
is
very
good
a
sixer
may
kill
joe
six
pack
if
he
isnt
paying
attention
not
something
i
would
revisit
on
purpose
but
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
it
on
tap
locally
or
at
a
friends
house
out
of
the
fridge
tasting
it
i
find
good
bit
of
maltiness
its
sweet
and
has
a
crisp
finish
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
refreshing
as
well
a
bit
sticky
in
the
moutfeel
perhaps
the
taste
of
prunes
breadiness
too
a
lot
more
complicated
than
i
thought
was
possible
in
a
beer
made
by
the
brewers
of
golden
anniversary
and
genny
cream
ale
a
good
surprise
not
mind
blowing
and
as
far
as
maibocks
go
i
prefer
dead
guy
but
this
is
still
satisfying
needless
to
say
im
sorry
i
didnt
buy
a
few
sixers
it
makes
me
rethink
jwds
pale
this
is
the
beer
ill
buy
while
its
available
if
this
was
6
it
would
still
be
a
great
buy
on
the
package
they
mention
a
hefe
ipa
and
scotch
porter
are
thier
seasonals
bring
em
this
offering
from
high
falls
is
very
good
i
got
it
in
a
sampler
with
the
amber
pale
ale
and
honey
brown
beautiful
color
a
dark
gold
with
creamy
but
not
excessive
off
white
head
some
lacing
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
saaz
hops
were
noticable
and
to
my
taste
might
be
a
little
weak
i
really
like
the
saaz
anyway
the
hops
are
there
but
this
is
a
malty
beer
as
it
should
be
and
the
balance
is
probably
true
to
style
this
is
absolute
proof
that
high
falls
knows
good
beer
truly
enjoyable
review
from
notes
sampled
with
the
brewer
and
a
bunch
of
bas
in
rochester
ny
this
new
brew
from
high
falls
is
really
something
to
appluad
a
nic
pale
heller
bock
brewed
for
the
masses
as
a
high
falls
seasonal
i
hear
an
ipa
may
follow
and
than
after
that
who
knows
big
kudos
to
dave
s
for
sharing
and
for
brewing
up
some
quality
micros
in
the
macro
world
this
one
is
very
plae
golden
with
an
eggshell
white
head
of
frippy
frothy
foam
that
lasts
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
as
well
aromas
are
freshly
baked
bread
bavarian
pretzels
and
more
malt
accented
flavors
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spicy
floral
german
and
us
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
bready
but
the
sweetness
is
not
overdone
and
the
spicy
hops
do
come
in
and
balance
everything
nicely
this
coupled
with
the
simple
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
make
its
drinkability
good
as
well
so
solid
it
is
like
a
rock
this
isnt
even
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
nailed
here
and
quite
tasty
drink
up
suprisingly
saw
this
on
tap
at
donnelys
public
house
in
fairportget
it
while
you
can
the
bartender
didnt
really
know
what
it
was
but
i
guess
it
is
a
test
or
something
anyways
i
loved
it
it
is
certainly
pale
as
it
pours
a
really
light
gold
the
taste
is
sorta
sweet
but
i
think
the
hops
are
more
dominant
perfect
amount
of
alcohol
interesting
brew
hopefully
we
will
see
it
in
the
stores
soon
as
high
falls
carries
on
through
tests
of
this
brew
i
say
yes
to
this
possible
seasonal
and
with
any
more
luck
theres
always
the
chance
well
see
it
next
year
all
in
all
its
a
satisfying
brew
cheers
to
dave
at
hf
for
taking
on
this
underrated
and
underappreciated
style
and
nailing
it
slightly
hazy
lightgolden
pour
with
very
little
foam
aroma
is
strawberry
to
the
max
like
a
desert
cake
flavors
are
dominated
by
sweet
strawberry
its
a
little
much
the
real
drawback
is
the
finish
which
has
a
slightly
throattightening
feel
this
is
similar
to
abitas
strawberry
lager
but
this
one
is
richer
and
slightly
heavier
on
the
palate
abita
always
has
reasonable
bomber
prices
around
6
which
allows
people
to
try
all
of
their
specialty
beer
this
one
is
a
must
that
you
shouldnt
pass
up
if
you
do
happen
to
stumble
upon
this
delicious
treat
a
slight
toasted
biscuit
character
at
first
but
mainly
strawberries
clean
crisp
finish
granted
i
drank
this
out
of
season
but
i
could
see
it
having
an
appeal
in
the
hotter
months
all
of
the
best
qualities
of
andygator
meets
all
of
the
best
qualities
of
strawberry
harvest
an
excellent
beer
the
strawberry
harvest
and
andygator
had
a
baby
and
it
was
a
beauty
overall
a
damn
tasty
beer
i
enjoyed
this
whatever
it
is
but
my
expectations
were
thoroughly
confused
not
challenged
mind
you
but
actually
confused
i
like
being
challenged
but
when
im
confused
i
just
feel
confused
when
mixing
5050
on
your
own
it
gives
more
of
the
blonde
doppelbock
flavors
of
grains
and
alcohol
this
version
is
more
strawberry
flavored
and
i
dont
think
it
is
as
good
it
definitely
goes
down
super
easy
and
i
would
classify
this
as
a
fruit
beer
before
i
would
a
doppel
or
mai
bock
im
glad
they
bottled
this
and
it
is
definitely
buy
it
again
especially
when
it
is
not
shl
season
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
label
says
its
a
doppelbock
but
ba
has
it
has
a
maibock
and
i
find
it
to
fit
into
that
category
nicely
and
even
though
a
lot
of
that
maibock
base
is
covered
up
by
the
strawberries
and
cream
it
still
works
since
the
flavors
are
so
nice
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
very
creamy
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
a
bottle
to
myself
and
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
great
late
spring
or
summertime
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
strawberry
cream
aspect
it
was
really
nice
and
the
star
of
the
show
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
maibock
base
wasnt
a
little
more
reconcilable
but
in
the
end
it
wasnt
that
big
of
a
deal
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
at
4
49
its
a
great
deal
and
i
could
see
myself
buying
more
than
a
few
of
these
during
the
summer
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
interested
in
a
strawberry
cream
flavored
beer
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
a
little
impressed
as
i
said
early
i
dont
have
the
highest
expectations
for
this
brewery
but
this
turned
out
to
be
one
tasty
beer
that
i
enjoyed
its
now
my
favorite
abita
beer
and
its
one
of
the
better
strawberry
beers
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
was
one
tasty
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
strawberries
if
someone
one
was
to
ask
what
style
is
it
id
say
i
dont
know
but
it
tastes
like
a
strawberry
shake
i
dont
like
abita
beers
much
but
this
is
surprisingly
tasty

abita
should
call
this
strawberry
haze
or
just
replace
the
purple
haze
for
this
most
strawberry
tasting
beer
ive
had
thats
not
a
lambic
or
sour
the
taste
isnt
fake
but
actually
tastes
like
real
strawberry
i
wish
abita
would
have
came
out
with
this
earlier
than
september
so
i
could
have
enjoyed
it
all
summer
and
im
surprised
that
the
abv
is
8
abita
has
a
winner
in
this
beer
but
i
had
it
very
fresh
so
who
knows
what
this
would
taste
like
if
its
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
few
months
overall
impressive
mix
of
two
worlds
american
brewed
german
style
with
american
harvested
louisiana
strawberries
blends
much
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
this
will
definitely
be
a
crossover
beer
for
someone
in
the
bud
miller
coors
segment
that
thinks
craft
beer
is
too
heavy
and
bitter
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
nice
golden
lager
with
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
haze
probably
from
the
strawberry
puree
lacing
isnt
huge
but
its
longlasting
nose
is
predominantly
bready
followed
by
faint
floralnoble
hops
and
strawberry
sweetness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
although
the
sweetness
is
dominant
and
bready
malt
and
floral
hops
take
a
backseat
to
the
strawberries
mouthfeel
is
roughly
the
same
as
andygator
between
medium
and
dry
fairly
carbonated
but
not
overpoweringly
so
whats
really
remarkable
is
how
well
this
beer
hides
the
8
abv
its
unbelievable
how
well
it
drinks
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
i
hate
to
speak
this
highly
of
a
fruit
beer
but
this
is
actually
really
good
this
is
a
case
where
the
whole
is
much
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
better
than
andygator
or
strawberry
harvest
and
combines
the
best
of
both
i
dont
like
most
of
abitas
offerings
but
they
really
got
this
one
right
beautiful
golden
beer
with
clearity
and
a
lacing
head
sweet
beer
with
subtle
floral
hop
notes
the
main
taste
is
strawberry
cake
and
vanilla
with
a
slight
candy
strawberry
taste
starberry
pancakes
too
the
alcohol
is
really
conceled
and
the
body
remains
light
interesting
beer
it
pours
smells
and
tastes
a
lot
lighter
than
a
high
gravity
8
abv
doppelbock
in
my
opinion
the
style
and
labeling
is
misleading
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
it
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
if
i
was
blind
folded
and
had
no
preconceived
ideas
i
probably
would
have
rated
this
beer
higher
it
was
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
i
would
never
turn
this
beer
down
but
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
only
because
there
are
so
many
other
beers
to
try
this
ones
not
bad
at
all
but
theres
not
much
about
it
that
makes
it
stand
out
either
i
think
the
reviews
are
generally
too
low
on
this
one
its
very
smooth
especially
for
8
one
of
my
favorites
by
abita
overall
a
good
beer
smooth
and
balanced
slight
malt
sweetness
slow
onset

finish
good

but
nothing
that
stands
out
from
a
12

into
a

with
little
precipitating
carbonation
vigorous
pour
produces
nice

and

crispiness

and

is
this
a
doppelbock
perhaps
whatever
it
is
its
certainly
a
fine
beer
though
nothing
incredible
would
try
again
it
didnt
look
like
a
dopplebock
more
like
a
regular

may
want
to

the

station
the
setting
was
better
than
the
beer
a
little
disappointing
and
definitely
not
reminiscient
of
a
doppelbock
to
me
its
an
interesting
brew
which
may
not
be
traditional
to
style
but
is
a
good
beer
none

seconds
no

great
low

taste
crisp
and
clean
not
like
traditional

what
the

this

slight

with
a
good

flavor
very
drinkable
beer
overall
super
offering
by
abita
my
fave
by
them
thus
far
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
them
they
go
for
a
little
drinkability
in
their
beers
so
they
probably
wont
blow
away
all
the
beer
snobs
cheers
a
solid
beer
to
sip
on
actually
much
better
when
mixed
with
abita
turbidog
terminator
or
abita
purple
haze
barney
its
pretty
amazing
how
well
this
beer
mixes
with
others
just
like
spaten
optimator
but
light
in
color
when
i
took
my
first
sip
of
this
i
couldnt
believe
that
it
was
8
00
abv
theres
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
smooth
its
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
had
there
arent
any
flavors
that
jump
out
and
punch
you
in
palate
and
i
think
thats
the
point
now
sold
in
regular
12oz
bottles
this
beer
is
now
served
dont
hate
it
until
youve
tried
it
in
mixed
form
with
abitas
purple
haze
and
strawberry
beers
throughout
many
bars
in
louisiana
poured
correctly
from
a
tap
this
beer
in
combination
with
either
of
the
others
mentioned
above
is
quite
delicious
even
smoother
with
a
distinct
taste
of
the
fruit
that
was
used
strawberry
or
raspberry
try
it
for
yourself
remember
to
sip
as
its
still
potent
and
post
for
yourself
overall
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
its
a
reasonable
doppelbock
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
belgian
character
to
it
green
apple
and
a
metallic
note
hints
of
peach
surface
flavor
reveals
an
overly
sweet
caramel
malt
base
toasted
notes
and
muted
peach
and
apple
skin
character
could
use
some
sharp
notes
to
clean
up
the
flab
i
hadnt
had
an
andygator
in
at
least
four
and
maybe
six
yearsand
it
may
very
well
have
been
the
first
doppelbock
i
knowingly
triedbut
im
reminded
that
despite
its
ubitquity
in
stores
its
meant
to
be
a
very
fine
beer
and
a
nice
clean
take
on
a
style
that
at
first
one
might
be
skeptical
could
successfully
originate
from
the
deepsouth
swamps
drinkability
smells
odd
but
tastes
pretty
good
easy
drinking
akin
to
a
very
strong
lager
light
and
quite
intoxicating
be
careful
sorry
but
the
aroma
and
the
aftertaste
of
this
brew
was
not
pleasant
so
only
gets
a
3
maybe
it
was
an
old
bottle
on
a
pick
6
i
just
might
have
to
try
another
one
before
i
cast
it
aside
a
lighter
beer
than
i
thought
it
would
be
still
delicious
and
very
drinkable
had
my
first
at
the
original
does
eat
place
in
greenville
ms
pours
hazy
yellow
smells
like
a
pilsner
sure
as
hell
stronger
than
one
though
malty
and
a
tiny
touch
of
fruit
maybe
i
guess
it
is
pretty
good
for
a
doppelbock
overall
oi
really
like
this
brew
this
is
my
favorite
abita
brew
so
far
tap
at
lazy
dog
macon
pours
transparent
orange
with
white
head
aroa
of
malts
tastes
of
malt
caramel
and
toffee
mediumbodied
not
that
great
it
felt
to
me
like
an
imperial
pilsner
with
alcohol
and
malts
predominating
too
much
over
hops
very
smooth
and
creamy
medium
full
bodied
beer
with
just
below
medium
carbonation
warming
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
good
malty
and
sweet
flavors
wrapped
up
in
a
very
smooth
creamy
quaff
delicious
great
beer
poured
from
an
ice
cold
bottle
into
a
glass
it
pours
a
yellow
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
i
gave
it
an
aggressive
pour
and
it
had
an
impressive
2
finger
head
it
smells
fresh
and
fruity
it
has
a
balanced
mouth
feel
not
thin
and
not
thick
balanced
and
not
bitter
at
all
this
might
be
my
first
helles
doppelbock
im
impressed
very
nice
and
with
an
abv
of
8
it
can
bite
ya
it
is
smooth
and
well
balanced
hints
of
fruit
and
just
a
slight
bitterness
i
must
say
i
do
believe
this
is
my
first
abita
beer
and
i
am
impressed
and
will
try
some
more
o
abita
makes
some
very
under
appreciated
lagers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
very
technically
sound
though
perhaps
a
bit
more
wellhopped
than
most
of
the
german
doppelbocks
ive
had
you
wont
find
me
complaining
though
maybe
its
recent
gabf
medal
win
will
get
people
to
take
more
notice
if
not
more
for
me
i
guess
an
excellent
affordable
doppelbock
i
strongly
recommend
love
this
beer
one
of
my
all
time
favorites

dont
let
the
color
fool
you
complex
flavor
of
a
good
bock
beer
that
tingles
all
of
your
taste
buds
good
slice
of
bread
trying
the
abita
abductors
at
the
pie
factory
in
florance
al
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
with
white
head
that
left
a
lace
the
scent
was
faint
with
hints
of
grass
and
biscuit
the
taste
was
very
strong
leaning
toward
grassy
peat
bread
the
m
outhfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
the
beer
didnt
hit
the
mark
for
me
o
a
surprisingly
nice
take
on
the
style
goes
to
show
that
breweries
can
surprise
you
out
of
the
blue
anyone
who
likes
germanstyle
beers
should
try
this
one
my
least
favorite
abita
had
a
good
aroma
did
not
like
the
thick
almost
slimy
feel
the
taste
was
almost
a
strong
bitter
amber
almost
that
this
brew
was
crafted
just
for
the
strong
alcohol
content
a
very
nice
helles
dopplebock
from
abita
pours
a
thick
yellow
straw
color
with
a
huge
rocky
head
of
white
dying
down
to
a
thin
foam
layer
with
excellent
clinging
lacing
smells
of
fresh
apples
pears
and
sweet
light
malts
excellent
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
with
light
caramel
and
slight
bittering
hops
on
the
back
not
a
lot
of
dimension
but
not
bad
at
all
i
would
compare
it
to
a
lot
of
the
russian
beers
yet
smoother
and
not
as
abrasive
to
the
novice
beer
drinker
also
would
love
to
have
it
side
by
side
to
the
hop
gator
which
i
have
had
and
liked
a
bit
more
this
beer
at
one
time
to
my
recollection
was
a
barley
wine
by
name
sold
in
small
little
kings
sized
bottles
a
bottle
style
many
i
know
referred
to
as
stop
sign
smashers
still
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
after
being
on
a
barrage
of
hopped
beer
its
a
pleasant
change
to
come
back
to
something
sweet
and
malty
andygator
is
one
of
its
many
useful
cures
sampled
this
at
a
tasting
and
even
though
its
no
dopplebock
ended
up
getting
a
bottle
and
it
pours
a
crystal
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
and
lacing
here
and
therethe
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
subtle
background
aroma
of
herbal
earthy
hopsthe
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
the
tastes
are
pretty
much
what
you
smell
its
a
big
malty
sweet
drop
but
finishes
evened
out
with
a
soft
bitterness
from
the
herbal
earthy
hops
and
overall
if
your
after
a
true
dopplebock
its
not
for
you
as
it
screams
more
otcoberfesthelles
to
me
but
if
your
after
a
sessionable
malty
golden
lightly
hopped
ale
with
a
decent
abv
then
yeah
give
it
a
crack
cheers
a
very
significant
pale
white
head
on
the
initial
pour
the
initial
aroma
was
surprisingly
intense
with
a
sweet
fruity
floral
character
it
didnt
strike
me
as
a
typical
helles
doppelbock
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
while
i
am
more
of
an
ipa
hophead
this
is
a
nice
light
summer
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
after
i
finished
the
beer
i
noticed
it
was
8
0
abv
which
came
as
a
big
surprise
it
drank
more
like
a
nice
5
0
session
beer
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
interesting
though
o
this
does
one
thing
really
well
it
drinks
easier
than
an
8
beer
should
but
apart
from
a
mild
booze
presence
it
tastes
lighter
than
an
8
beer
should
even
worse
it
doesnt
seem
fully
in
balance
id
never
refuse
one
i
just
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
one
and
wanted
to
try
it
because
i
love
doppelbocks
but
this
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
at
all
oreally
liked
it
drank
a
draft
out
on
a
river
bank
before
dinner
which
multiplied
my
feelings
of
relaxation
and
pleasure
pours
out
a
deep
clear
gold
with
a
fizzier
white
head
the
head
has
goodgreat
retention
and
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
undefined
with
some
slight
bready
notes
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
the
taste
is
a
close
match
it
has
a
nice
weight
to
the
body
crisp
but
not
fizzy
if
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
robust
this
would
be
a
great
beer
its
certainly
not
bad
the
aftertaste
is
fresh
spring
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
you
should
try
well
done

ami
12
oz

bready

and

sweet
for
me
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
foamy
head
on
it
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
ok
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
with
some
breadiness
maybe
some
faint
banana
in
there
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
bit
of
dryness
and
no
sweetness
a
touch
thin
for
an
8
beer
some
malts
a
hint
of
spices
ok
but
i
expect
more
in
an
8
beer
the
taste
is
also
rather
biscuit
and
breadylike
with
a
clean
crisp
hop
finish
it
is
8
abv
but
you
wouldnt
know
it
o
decent
but
unspectacular
o
a
good
get
drunk
however
this
camp
will
still
rely
on
side
pocket
for
that
picked
this
up
without
knowing
anything
about
it
because
i
needed
a
4th
to
get
the
10
bottle
discount
pretty
average
all
around
beer
nothing
special
in
appearance
smell
but
taste
is
pretty
good
but
not
special
overall
the
beer
gets
bonus
points
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
for
8
and
presents
a
good
value
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
liked
it
probably
because
of
the
8
but
i
would
buy
again
a
respectable
helles
doppelbock
decent
balance
of
malt
taste
and
sweetness
with
a
fairly
intense
hop
bitterness
the
8
0
abv
is
noticeable
but
in
a
subdued
way
and
doesnt
overpower
things
taste
and
feel
may
seem
a
little
coarse
in
some
ways
yet
it
still
fits
the
bill
for
a
heavyduty
lager
styled
beer
with
good
character
served
in
a
cold
mug
at
the
acme
oyster
house
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
very
good
nice
aroma
and
taste
and
a
nice
little
extra
pop
very
surprised
at
the
quality
but
decided
to
try
at
the
bar
i
will
have
this
brew
again
in
the
near
future
probably
at
the
same
place
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
have
one
again
for
some
reason
the
bottle
says
it
is
a
doppelbock
but
this
site
has
it
listed
as
a
maibock
so
i
wont
rate
this
as
a
doppelbock
because
if
i
did
it
would
be
a
poor
doppelock
not
heavy
on
the
malt
and
dark
to
be
sure
overall
it
is
a
great
maibock
actually
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
drank
it
a
bit
colder
than
room
temp
and
it
is
very
fruity
and
golden
in
color
just
like
a
tripel
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
with
lots
of
alcohol
beautiful
golden
color
and
tasty
not
zay
doppel
to
be
sure
overall
i
liked
it
but
didnt
love
it
i
found
many
of
the
individual
characteristics
to
be
attractive
but
the
sum
total
seemed
just
slightly
above
average
im
sure
ill
buy
andygator
again
as
its
a
good
value
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
served
in
a
big
frosty
litre
mug
at
my
local
watering
hole
the
baltic
my
kinda
beer
not
too
hoppy
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
enough
but
not
too
much
aroma
to
keel
you
over
the
next
day
a
huge
kick
too
yummy
if
youre
in
the
east
bay
and
wanna
good
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
try
the
baltic
for
happy
hour
andygator
like
all
good
examples
of
the
style
is
very
lean
but
very
muscular
it
doesnt
hit
a
ton
of
notes
but
the
ones
it
does
are
sung
loud
and
held
long
given
the
naturally
understated
qualities
of
helles
bocks
im
not
surprised
it
has
failed
to
impress
others
but
bock
lovers
will
certainly
recognize
and
appreciate
its
quality
composure
and
authenticity
good
job
overall
i
pretty
much
liked
everything
about
this
except
the
taste
and
the
abv
really
comes
out
o
while
abita
calls
andygator
a
helles
doppelbock
its
hoppiness
and
crisp
clean
malt
profile
lean
pretty
closely
to
the
maibock
style
or
at
least
a
crossover
of
the
two
sweet
and
fruity
the
bready
malt
base
of
this
beer
make
it
just
as
satisfying
as
the
german
liquid
bread
doppels
though
finished
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
character
this
was
an
enjoyable
experience
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
well
crafted
i
would
enjoy
something
like
this
in
the
summer
relying
on
a
simple
malt
driven
profile
this
beer
is
very
clean
breadlike
notes
akin
to
crystal
malts
overwhelm
the
entirety
of
this
beer
with
honey
and
light
piney
notes
in
the
background
overall
its
cheap
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
profile
after
thought
i
guess
i
would
drink
this
over
apple
juice
o
sweet
smooth
and
simple
goes
down
decently
well
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
slick
overall
not
bad
pours
out
to
a
thick
white
head
that
is
creamy
and
lasting
with
moderate
lacing
color
is
golden
amber
aroma
is
grainy
and
boozy
with
a
touch
of
noble
hop
aroma
there
is
not
much
complexity
to
hide
the
8
abv
flavor
is
sweet
malt
sweet
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
there
is
an
imbalance
toward
sweet
flavors
but
for
such
a
high
gravity
this
is
expected
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
boozy
easysipping
high
falutin
malt
liquor
with
no
off
flavors
or
roughness
it
does
lack
complexity
but
i
like
it
really
like
this
beer
year
round
it
has
a
sweetness
with
medium
body
taste
but
has
an
easy
drinkability
snap
pairs
really
well
with
hearty
meats
and
strong
cheeses
and
pickled
vegetables
the
appearance
is
cloudy
wheat
color
with
a
nice
head
one
of
our
favorite
beers
from
abita
american
double
imperial
pilsner
overall
this
is
a
very
a
good
brew
with
8
abv
the
alcohol
does
protrude
through
the
beer
this
is
a
good
bold
larger
with
a
sweet
spicy
flavor
it
finishes
with
the
perfect
hoppiness
if
this
is
a
big
bad
boy
from
the
bayou
i
am
not
seeing
it
i
felt
that
the
8
0
abv
was
surprisingly
well
hidden
which
it
a
plus
this
beer
was
not
as
advertised
but
still
comes
across
as
a
decent
lager
for
me
fuller
bodied
than
i
expected
pushing
above
medium
effervescence
is
restrained
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
crops
up
some
several
seconds
after
the
swallow
a
cloying
film
also
develops
sadly
on
the
palate
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
tongue
all
told
a
decent
brew
but
just
that
o
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
i
was
on
travel
and
hadnt
seen
it
before
so
i
wasnt
really
expecting
anything
its
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
i
think
if
it
had
been
a
little
sweeter
in
taste
with
a
bit
more
flavor
i
would
have
liked
it
much
better
as
is
it
just
seems
like
an
overly
alcoholic
lager
comparable
to
ayinger
and
hofbrau
maibock
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
textbook

bock
pleasantly
surprised
from
abita
who
i
think
generally
makes
pretty
lackluster
brews
i
would
buy
it
again
when
in
the
mood
brilliant
gold
in
color
with
great
clarity
and
moderate
carbonation
a
light
wisp
of
foam
rests
on
top
of
the
beer
i
get
a
lot
of
light
biscuity
malt
and
lager
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
brisk
the
flavor
is
more
light
malt
and
biscuit
like
flavor
its
smooth
with
a
solid
crispness
in
a
medium
body
and
some
sort
of
thickness
to
it
its
not
viscous
per
se
but
on
the
heavier
side
despite
the
crisp
clean
effect
clean
and
basic
but
quite
drinkable
perhaps
lacking
in
uniqueness
but
nicely
balanced
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
pretty
enjoyable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
big
bad
boy
from
the
bayou
abita
has
produced
some
lack
luster
brews
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
really
good
as
far
as
bocks
go
this
follows
all
the
rules

mine
with

the

had
waiting
on

a

is
no
so
mild
biscuits
alcohol
malts
some
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
got
it
in
a
trade
as
an
extra
and
glad
i
did
not
a
style
i
get
to
enjoy
often
would
have
it
again
if
i
saw
it
but
nothing
to
seek
out
overall
a
very
wellexecuted
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
from
abita
id
recommend
it
this
was
certainly
a
smooth
brew
with
a
very
thin
consistency
it
was
rather
light
on
the
palate
and
had
slightly
more
character
than
a
high
gravity
malt
liquor
like
st
ides
or
a
steel
reserve
overall
ok
brew
a
bit
sweet
could
find
many
better
examples
of
the
style
with
a
few
tweaks
not
too
far
off
from
being
a
contender
in
the
imperial
helles
category
as
it
is
more
like
a
clean
malt
liquor
o
for
a
very
unique
style
a
helles
dopplebocks
i
think
this
fits
the
name
just
like
a
helles
on
steroids
highly
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
nice
attempt
by
abita
but
i
am
less
than
impressed
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
just
way
too
weak
allaround
and
it
is
a
bit
boring

recedes

a
level
that
just
qualifies
as
full

coverage
aroma
is
mild
smelling
of
honey
hay
and
a
faint
tropical
fruitiness
i
have
no
idea
what
a
helles
bock
should
taste
like
but
its
much
milder
than
i
expected
theres
a
gentle
bready
honeyed
malt
flavor
with
enough
earthy
herbal
hops
to
balance
it
out
some
pepper
is
evident
as
well
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
medicinal
but
mostly
dry
the
hops
become
a
bit
more
aggressive
as
it
warms
i
must
say
that
the
alcohol
is
adeptly
concealed
as
i
never
would
have
suspected
its
8
abv
present
tingly
carbonation
lends
a
lively
mouthfeel
that
complements
the
flavor
profile
nicely
despite
the
highly
generic
presentation
and
mild
aroma
this
brew
was
a
pleasant
surprise
yielding
a
drinkable
balanced
character
that
belies
its
weight
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
but
a
pretty
quality
offering
nonetheless
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
one
abita
usually
makes
a
good
quality
beer
but
this
one
is
truly
disappointing
sent
back
waiter
told
me
i
wasnt
the
first
beer
has
a
nasty
smell
and
tastes
as
if
the
beer
is
still
wort
had
three
friends
with
me
try
it
as
well
and
all
agreed
its
the
worst
beer
they
have
ever
tasted
do
not
recommend
this
beer
is
much
improved
by
adding
a
half
ounce
of
woodford
reserve
the
whisky
rounds
out
the
less
attractive
edges
and
adds
the
pleasing
characteristics
of
bourbon
a
surprisingly
balanced
cocktail
also
surprising
is
the
disappearance
of
the
offputting
nose
o
abita
has
done
it
again
this
thing
is
tremendous
and
really
has
set
the
bar
high
for
doppelbocks
domestic
and
imported
alike
this
is
much
much
better
than
the
celebrator
from
ayinger
which
is
rated
as
the
top
doppelbock
in
the
world
definitely
tasty
and
if
you
go
slow
it
smooths
out
and
leaves
you
with
a
very
subtle
bit
of
fruit
that
gives
this
tremendous
drinkability
thanks
ian
not
really
my
favorite
type
of
beer
might
purchase
again
enjoyed
while
in
new
orleans
for
cantillon
zwanze
day
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
corn
grain
and
spice
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
grain
floral
wheat
grain
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
average
brew
i
really
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
that
much
if
i
am
honest
however
this
was
about
the
only
thing
that
was
listed
on
the
menu
that
i
had
not
had
before
while
we
were
grabbing
food
after
the
zwanze
day
festivities
there
was
just
too
much
of
a
spicy
and
wheat
aspect
going
on
here
the
aroma
kind
of
reminded
me
of
an
adjunct
lager
in
a
way
with
the
corn
aspect
going
on
really
glad
it
didnt
carry
over
still
not
that
great
unfortunately
overall
not
too
bad
but
nothing
special
it
is
easy
to
drink
which
seems
to
be
the
point
now
that
i
read
the
back
of
the
bottle
if
thats
your
joint
then
maybe
this
is
for
you
but
i
like
higher
abvs
to
demand
a
little
respect
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
sadly
i
would
add
that
most
of
the
abita
that
ive
had
as
been
great
onothing
exciting
here
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
for
a
stronger
beer
ill
give
it
a
3
5
just
for
that
it
really
tastes
like
a
strong
peppery
pilsner
beer
nothing
strikes
me
as
german
but
ultimately
its
just
too
much
spice
to
be
a
good
beer
has
some
good
characteristics
but
the
mouthfeel
just
kills
it
o
a
little
too
much
alcohol
is
detectable
in
this
beer
for
me
and
i
do
not
feel
like
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
o
this
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
isnt
that
prominent
in
the
taste
j
i
found
this
to
be
an
average
beer
ok
so
im
a
hillbilly
from
arkansas
not
sure
how
that
lowers
my
rating
ability
but
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
smell
the
taste
the
fullness
of
the
beer
just
wasnt
there
for
me
i
like
a
lot
of
the
beers
out
of
la
love
all
of
the
bayou
tech
stuff
ive
tried
and
most
of
the
abita
this
one
just
wasnt
special
enough
for
5
dollars
for
a
22oz
bottle
and
i
also
had
to
drive
to
memphis
to
get
it
so
maybe
that
didnt
help
any
i
mean
i
didnt
drive
over
just
for
this
but
picked
it
up
with
a
batch
of
beers
i
wanted
to
try
its
ok
just
not
great
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
sugar
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavour
was
a
surprise
as
well
not
incredibly
sweet
by
any
stretch
surprisingly
light
thankfully
not
overly
hoppy
at
all
perfect
amount
of
hops
here
despite
the
lightness
of
it
all
alcohol
is
incredibly
subdued
for
8
but
thankfully
still
discernible
but
man
i
could
probably
chug
this
down
if
i
wanted
to
both
due
to
the
light
crisp
flavour
and
the
seemingly
magically
hidden
alcohol
content
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
but
its
really
quite
good
nonetheless
the
only
other
thing
ive
encountered
that
claimed
to
be
a
helles
doppelbock
was
made
by
samichlaus
that
was
14
alcohol
and
a
thick
sweet
concoction
amazing
of
course
but
in
no
way
related
to
this
this
is
a
totally
different
approach
im
pretty
sure
i
even
taste
wheat
in
this
this
is
far
more
on
the
helles
side
not
so
much
on
the
doppelbock
side
but
in
all
the
right
ways
its
less
bitter
and
a
tad
more
sweet
than
most
helles
bocks
and
of
course
its
got
that
doppelbock
level
of
alcohol
good
stuff
overall
very
nice
beer
better
when
poured
around
and
drank
while
with
a
group
this
comes
across
a
bit
grainy
to
me
its
also
a
bit
warm
with
an
excessive
alcohol
warmth
the
drinkability
would
be
improved
a
great
deal
if
it
were
toned
down
slightly
the
flavor
and
body
are
mediocre
i
would
expect
more
from
a
maibock
i
think
i
saw
this
one
first
on
the
show
true
blood
caught
an
8
growler
sale
on
this
8abv
beer
and
had
to
give
it
a
try
light
colored
with
a
massive
white
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
a
floral
belgian
aroma
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
o
heavier
gravity
but
without
a
warming
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
behind
a
great
balance
bready
without
a
boozy
taste
or
warmth
definitely
one
of
my
go
to
draft
beers
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
overall
and
a
solid
maibock
o
a
fine
refreshing
high
abv
dobblebock
that
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
pils
3
75
o
a
very
different
abita
offering
one
of
those
cutting
the
grass
session
beers
will
do
well
in
mississippi
when
they
bring
it
in
july
this
gator
nibbles
at
your
taste
buds
then
puts
the
chomp
down
for
a
decent
helles
bock
i
bet
its
even
better
on
tap
appearance
is
bright
yellow
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
its
nose
has
lemon
sugar
a
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
sweet
more
lemon
mouthfeel
is
medium
clean
finish
a
very
average
tasting
helles
bock
but
one
that
is
nonetheless
still
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
deceptively
drinkable
wish
it
had
a
somewhat
bolder
flavor
though
o
this
lager
isnt
one
to
bring
lots
of
complexity
or
stand
out
from
the
pack
but
with
its
crisp
lighter
body
its
certainly
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
was
the
strongest
point
of
the
beer
for
me
and
while
a
little
light
for
the
style
it
still
seemed
to
work
pretty
well
overall
there
are
plenty
of
nice
maibocks
out
there
to
choose
from
but
this
offering
is
a
solid
choice
when
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
crisper
option
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
clear
orange
gold
with
a
large
white
head
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
appears
to
be
well
carbonated
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
during
consumption
and
the
bubbles
later
become
tiny
there
are
aromas
of
sweet
malts
hops
and
fruits
there
are
flavors
of
sweet
malts
mild
hop
bitterness
and
some
fruit
like
apple
or
pear
its
bready
there
is
also
some
faintly
perceptible
alcohol
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
carbonation
is
adequate
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
not
the
best
of
abitas
big
beers
but
it
is
certainly
very
good
good
beer
in
its
own
right
i
feel
abita
accomplished
what
it
set
out
to
do
here
poured
from
tap
into
pint
glass
at
portico
in
monroe
la
pours
a
crisp
golden
color
with
some
good
sticky
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
boozey
malts
slight
bitter
hop
taste
but
its
deff
a
helles
nice
straw
flavor
as
well
overall
really
not
a
bad
brew
and
neat
to
see
a
helles
with
a
bit
of
bite
doa
overall
had
this
beer
a
few
times
now
and
it
still
remains
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
overall
not
very
memorable
although
a
memorable
helles
is
challenging
to
make
d
very
sessionable
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
very
surprised
to
see
such
a
low
rating
for
this
beer
i
drank
it
on
a
sober
pallet
andygator
poured
a
vibrant
gold
with
a
perfect
two
finger
head
although
the
head
dissipated
after
two
minutes
to
about
a
quarter
inch
i
did
notice
it
had
extraordinary
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
malt
not
too
overpowering
though
after
the
first
taste
i
was
very
impressed
floral
sweet
and
smooth
all
the
way
to
the
end
there
was
a
slight
taste
of
hops
left
in
the
back
of
my
throat
the
medium
body
and
crisp
carbonation
complement
the
taste
perfectly
i
will
admit
that
this
was
my
first
doppelbock
thus
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
however
overall
i
would
say
this
is
certainly
a
new
favorite
beer
o
i
like
what
abita
has
done
here
the
idea
of
a
helles
doppelbock
seemed
interesting
and
the
andygator
does
a
great
job
of
being
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
this
isnt
pretentious
at
all
and
is
well
worth
your
time
if
you
want
a
hearty
sessionable
imperialstyle
lager
o
this
is
a
nice
bock
from
abita
good
value
at
less
than
5
for
a
bomber
o
i
liked
the
way
this
beer
started
but
it
just
ended
somewhat
light
almost
has
that
water
down
taste
easy
to
drink
the
abv
is
hidden
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
o
the
fruitiness
of
the
beer
overwhelms
other
aspects
a
little
bit
but
otherwise
good
it
was
a
pretty
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
finger
head
the
smell
was
pretty
much
just
sweet
alcohol
and
citrus
the
taste
was
pretty
much
right
on
with
the
smell
the
sweet
was
overpowering
almost
saccharine
and
the
citurs
flavors
were
pretty
mild
i
emphasize
how
sweet
in
a
bad
way
that
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
mild
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
dismal
im
normally
pretty
comfortable
around
abita
but
this
one
may
have
changed
my
mind
like
i
said
i
thought
it
was
something
along
the
lines
of
a
hefe
mainly
from
the
citrus
flavors
and
sweetness
and
the
fact
that
i
almost
never
ever
like
wheat
beers
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
with
nice
sweet
aromas
and
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
relaxing
overall
sweet
and
enjoyable
though
it
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
sophistication
of
the
german
examples
overall
ill
admit
this
is
a
go
to
beer
for
me
i
love
the
higher
abv
hides
it
exceptionally
well
smooth
beer
really
good
to
get
a
pitcher
of
it
at
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
and
share
a
pitcher
or
two
with
someone
really
well
balanced
beer
and
im
on
abitas
side
great
beers
ive
had
this
on
draft
in
a
growler
and
in
bottles
i
keep
plenty
on
stock
for
when
i
want
to
do
some
session
drinking
and
this
is
my
main
stay
overall
youre
better
off
saving
money
and
just
buying
malt
liquor
this
is
a
terrible
beer
i
cant
believe
im
saying
this
but
bud
light
platinum
is
basically
the
same
beer
as
andygator
only
better
better
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
still
pretty
decent
o
nice
and
refreshing
mellow
bouquet
of
fruit
flavors
and
a
smooth
yet
boozy
finish
nice
summer
beer
which
i
will
probably
revisit
then
so
it
goes
to
show
you
other
places
that
serve
half
pours
are
fucking
rips
off
i
always
knew
they
were
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
served
on
tap
at
a
jacksonville
pizza
restaurant
and
i
was
very
pleased
others
at
the
table
enjoyed
it
as
well
served
in
smaller
glasses
which
was
a
benefit
since
its
stronger
than
it
tastes
o
overall
definitely
one
of
the
lighter
beers
i
can
see
why
this
would
make
an
excellent
spring
welcome
beer
but
other
than
that
a
very
light
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
o
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
average
lager
maibock
is
not
my
favorite
style
anyway
but
to
me
this
is
a
strictly
mediocre
offering
this
is
one
i
will
probably
pass
on
in
the
future
serving
type
growler
for
being
relatively
light
bodied
this
beer
needs
more
carbonation
abitas
answer
to
the
40
ouncer
this
has
an
almost
maltliquor
taste
to
it
with
tons
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
honestly
probably
not
abitas
best
effort
i
wouldnt
rush
out
looknig
for
this
one
anytime
soon

salsa

i
accidentally
chillhazed
it
a
bit
so
i
let
it
breathe
a
while
in
the
tulip
glass
to
warm
up
two
fingers
of
foam
that
falls
apart
in
less
than
a
minute
no

left
behind
medium

with
really
nice

just
a
touch
of
stickiness
to
the
body
nice
floral
scent
overlaid
with
mild
generic
fruit
esters
some
caramel
malt
appears
in
the
nose
once
it
gets
good
and
warmed
up
to
room
temperature
taste
is
semisweet
the
generic
esters
on
the
nose
come
into
focus
as
restrained
pear
tones
garnished
with
herbal
hopping
notes
overall
a
nice
tasty
maibock
hides
the
alcohol
rather
well
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
not
really
very
distinctive
from
similar
offerings
either
maybe
the
high
abv
counts
as
being
distinctive

overall
this
is
a
very
solid
imperial
helles
lager
in
my
eyes
with
sweet
dopplebock
tones
most
affordable
at
only
5
dollars
so
give
it
a
try
drinkability
is
okay
its
smooth
and
goes
down
with
ease
the
diacetyl
is
an
obvious
flaw
but
it
actual
provides
some
otherwise
absent
complexity
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
it
smells
of
apple
and
caramel
slightly
tart
with
hints
of
citrus
and
honey
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
pear
and
apple
there
is
a
hint
of
honey
alcohol
and
bready
malt
its
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
an
interesting
dopplebock
its
fruity
and
not
as
malt
driven
as
others
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
i
remember
back
in
the
day
when
this
beer
came
out
once
again
abita
was
an
innovator
in
the
microbrew
industry
that
wasnt
even
an
industry
yet
back
then
lol
i
still
love
it
and
am
glad
i
can
now
find
it
on
the
west
coast
it
has
a
nice
goldenamber
color
and
is
both
malty
and
hoppy
in
flavor
but
not
overpowering
on
either
account
very
well
balanced
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
overall
i
feel
like
i
paid
five
bucks
for
an
old
english
boo
hiss
pretty
unmemorable
overall
but
not
bad
welltextured
with
a
medium
consistency
and
a
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
this
could
benefit
from
a
little
time
to
mellow
a
solid
offering
though
i
would
pick
up
a
4pack
of
celebrator
before
springing
for
another
bomber
here
drinkability
for
a
high
abv
beer
8
theres
no
strong
alcohol
flavor
the
light
and
fruity
flavors
make
it
a
unique
helles
bock
and
one
that
is
very
easy
to
session
with
i
will
be
grabbing
more
of
this
to
take
along
on
vacation
with
me
soon
a
perfect
brew
to
enjoy
around
a
campfire
or
on
the
deck
with
friends
friends
who
enjoy
good
beer
nice
floral
rose
finish
after
a
very
tart
beginning
this
beer
could
definitely
get
another
sitting
overall
drinkability
good
actually
really
good
surprisingly
overall
a
good
beer
but
chill
it
first
tastesweet
malt
peach
lemongrass
hint
of
honeyed
bread
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
the
strength
a
refreshing
sipper
served
cold
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
o
this
is
a
bit
strange
but
at
least
it
goes
down
easy
for
such
a
strong
brew
overall
not
bad
at
all
hides
the
8
abv
really
well
and
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
o
this
was
an
amazingly
easy
drinker
that
hid
its
abv
extremely
well
i
would
definitely
tell
others
to
give
this
a
try
and
hope
abita
continues
to
push
style
boundaries
d
pretty
nice
little
beer
here
one
was
good
with
me
but
the
8
really
never
hit
me
it
hide
the
8
pretty
good
i
had
never
seen
the
abita
so
i
took
a
chance
and
found
another
good
brew
from
our
friends
at
abita
pours
a
clear
sparkly
gold
a
white
head
rears
back
but
coats
the
glass
smell
is
floral
and
herbal
and
hoppy
nicely
unexpected
from
a
beefy
helles
taste
quickly
morphs
into
the
nutty
bitter
and
slightly
pungent
bock
character
finishes
straight
boozy
although
this
might
be
exaggerated
by
the
inherent
feel
of
the
doppelbock
very
big
contrast
smelltotaste
imo
a
unique
offering
im
pleased
once
again
with
the
experimentation
of
abita
i
like
this
one
not
to
heavy
but
with
enough
weight
to
carry
its
own
some
bite
but
not
enough
to
run
you
away
the
sweetness
entices
you
would
be
a
great
beer
for
thai
food
it
poured
yellow
to
light
orange
color
it
has
a
small
white
foaming
head
i
smelled
hints
of
citrus
herbs
floral
and
grassy
notes
i
tasted
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
hop
with
a
malty
finish
i
tasted
it
on
tap
before
they
ever
bottled
it
and
i
felt
that
at
the
time
it
felt
heavier
than
in
the
bottle
i
need
to
pass
by
the
brewery
pub
to
taste
again
from
my
weekend
notes
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
clear
golden
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
nose
is
grassey
floral
and
lightly
sweet
tastes
of
grass
florals
apple
juice
and
yeast
sweet
enough
to
balance
the
grass
and
florals
but
not
overly
fruity
or
estery
the
big
draw
of
this
beer
is
the
abv
and
turned
out
to
be
an
ok
brew
this
beer
surprised
me
i
was
little
skeptical
at
first
it
being
a
double
bock
and
helles
hybrid
i
found
it
to
have
very
pleasing
aroma
it
was
not
as
rich
as
a
bock
but
not
as
fruity
as
a
helles
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
taste
it
has
the
caramel
and
roastyness
of
a
bock
it
also
has
the
grassgrainy
and
citrus
flavor
of
the
helles
the
body
is
medium
two
styles
combined
into
a
great
marriage
the
beer
i
know
wont
let
me
down
when
theres
nothing
wildly
interesting
on
tap
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
color
was
pretty
with
a
yellowish
base
and
a
golden
hue
head
was
healthy
white
and
about
one
and
a
half
fingers
strong
little
lacing
smell
was
initially
grassy
with
some
florals
taste
has
a
bit
more
malt
to
it
with
the
florals
taking
more
of
a
back
seat
feel
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
great
flavor
smell
and
feel
d
a
really
easy
drinker
for
its
weight
wellcrafted
bought
a
22
of
this
while
i
was
in
california
and
brought
it
home
to
oregon
i
poured
this
into
a
coke
glass
think
perfect
pintish
which
resulted
in
a
thick
white
head
on
top
of
the
rich
golden
color
beer
the
head
retention
was
impressive
it
reversed
very
slowly
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
some
citrus
hops
seems
inviting
taste
starts
with
light
malts
some
interesting
sweet
and
fruit
flavors
hops
come
in
toward
the
end
to
help
finish
the
sip
with
a
little
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
just
a
touch
thick
for
my
preferences
overall
i
dont
know
if
i
was
able
to
fully
appreciate
this
beer
id
like
to
try
it
again
next
time
i
visit
ca
starts
out
fine
ends
a
bit
boring
but
if
this
is
your
style
its
easier
to
look
beyond
that
said
there
is
something
deficient
on
the
taste
i
like
the
direction
but
it
seems
a
little
thin
i
dunno
o
very
good
almost
too
easy
to
drink
drinkability
a
very
interesting
beer
the
lovely
grape
flavours
were
surprisingly
good
but
different
i
fear
this
may
be
a
little
too
complex
for
my
developing
palette
i
must
try
this
one
again
at
a
later
time
regardless
i
will
be
enjoying
this
brew
to
the
last
drop
1325
altogether
i
think
if
you
get
rid
of
the
residual
yeast
this
brew
would
hold
its
own
against
any
german
made
maibock
overall
enjoyable
but
the
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
served
ontap
at
mellow
mushroom
in
jacksonville
fl
the
beer
was
poured
in
a
pint
glass
and
presented
a
crystal
clear
strawgold
coloring
with
a
thin
white
film
of
head
fruity
malty
aromas
with
light
hints
of
grain
the
beer
has
tangy
fruity
flavors
with
round
bold
malty
notes
and
a
grainy
ending
the
beer
is
extremely
light
and
crisp
in
mouth
with
a
slightly
sour
fruit
aftertaste
the
finish
is
filmy
in
mouth
and
the
lingering
sour
changes
to
a
musty
flavor
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
clean
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
yeasty
and
full
of
fresh
fruits
including
strong
citrus
and
raisin
the
taste
has
a
distinct
sweetness
with
a
strong
malt
finish
and
a
warm
alcohol
affect
stronger
carbonation
in
this
lighter
brew
seems
to
carry
a
lot
of
helles
characteristics
was
a
nice
touch
of
all
the
abita
i
had
in
no
la
this
was
a
good
one
to
bring
back
and
share
i
would
suggest
this
brew
to
a
friend
this
is
something
that
would
be
served
well
at
a
weekend
lunch
the
complexity
isnt
overwelming
with
would
make
it
a
nice
midday
beverage
overall
although
not
terribly
memorable
it
is
refreshing
mild
aroma
taste
and
aftertaste
make
it
easily
sessionable
even
at
8
abv
flavor
is
very
clean
light
has
a
smoothbuttery
feel
its
malts
arent
too
prominent
but
that
is
not
a
negative
the
8
alcohol
is
more
noticeable
with
such
a
light
beer
but
its
not
distracting
to
me
after
an
evident
but
not
significant
bready
flavor
there
is
littletono
hint
of
hops
which
i
expected
more
of
given
the
style
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
as
well
overall
id
say
andygator
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
clean
and
flavorful
enough
to
satisfy
its
not
great
but
its
simply
a
good
beer
big
malt
presence
here
i
would
have
like
some
more
hops
but
carbonation
helps
out
a
little
with
balance
a
helles
dopplebock
seems
weird
maybe
they
were
going
for
an
imperial
helles
bock
has
great
drink
ability
but
the
abv
will
catch
up
to
you
overall
very
enjoyable
medium
carbonation
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
even
sessionable
at
this
high
abv
d
may
give
this
one
another
shot
as
i
did
buy
the
last
bottle
that
was
on
the
self
at
the
time
so
i
may
have
had
an
older
bottle
but
cant
say
that
i
was
blown
away
by
this
beer
this
review
will
be
subject
to
edit
if
and
when
i
get
another
d
pleasantly
surprised
this
being
the
first
of
the
style
i
recall
having
can
see
this
as
an
entry
beer
for
those
who
drink
fruity
white
wines
and
wine
coolers
but
dislike
the
beer
taste
of
real
beers
sweetness
would
stop
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
but
hey
thats
me
this
is
a
great
sipper
hides
its
strength
well
despite
the
strength
was
tempted
to
risk
sessioning
this
id
definitely
have
it
again
d
i
wont
buy
another
bottle
but
i
wont
turn
down
a
glass
i
will
try
on
tap
if
ever
found
as
i
feel
this
is
a
style
that
is
not
best
suited
to
bottling
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
one
the
other
day
primarily
because
i
had
enjoy
save
our
shores
but
also
because
5
seemed
like
such
a
small
risk
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
the
bottle
was
enjoyable
enough
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
sweet
and
full
bodied
with
bready
malts
caramel
and
a
little
honey
good
but
kind
of
forgettable
drinkability
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
the
andygator
pours
a
deep
yellow
to
orange
color
a
pure
white
head
sits
on
top
with
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
very
subtle
but
some
malts
breads
and
little
floral
notes
taste
is
pretty
smooth
not
too
complex
but
nice
malts
grains
and
hops
make
up
the
quaff
a
very
sessionable
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
abita
beer
and
i
have
had
a
good
number
of
them
pours
a
pretty
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
luxurious
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
strong
hop
aroma
and
some
malts
a
blitz
of
hop
bitterness
is
up
front
but
then
mellows
out
towards
the
end
leaving
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
little
citrus
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
d
should
not
be
as
easy
drinking
as
it
is
cannot
tell
as
all
that
is
a
8
beer
d
considering
the
high
abv
this
one
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
its
a
bit
on
the
thicker
but
not
overbearing
d
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
with
subtle
hints
of
different
spices
i
easily
drank
this
one
drinkability
i
can
see
that
this
beer
actually
does
really
fit
with
the
bottle
description
helles
doppelbock
in
that
it
is
an
helles
bock
with
extra
oomph
to
strengthen
the
alcohol
that
said
ive
not
become
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
lacks
some
of
the
subtle
complexity
i
like
to
find
in
an
helles
bock
it
was
ok
to
try
it
but
ill
probably
not
revisit
this
one
i
thought
this
one
better
on
tap
overall
avoid
when
i
ordered
this
beer
my
brother
who
is
from
louisiana
said
thats
what
we
order
at
the
bar
when
we
just
want
to
get
wasted
i
ordered
it
anyway
but
after
having
one
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
him
it
is
big
malty
boozy
and
tastes
more
like
an
old
english
than
a
craft
beer
although
big
lagers
an
pilsners
tend
to
have
that
quality
good
drink
ability
doesnt
chase
you
away
from
the
alcohol
and
has
flavor
will
have
to
try
again
to
see
if
it
holds
up
pours

two

light
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to

i
appreciate
experimentation
with
imperial
styles
but
this
one
just
doesnt
work
that
well
for
me
i
dont
think
the
beer
is
poorly
conceived
but
i
dont
think
that
it
really
works
as
a
style
nice
try
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
this
goes
high
on
the
list
of
brews
that
i
want
a
lot
more
of
skål
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
is
obviously
intended
to
be
the
style
that
it
says
it
is
which
is
a
good
thing
for
an
american
version
of
a
german
beer
that
often
isnt
the
case
bock
for
example
that
said
it
lacks
the
richness
that
you
get
from
most
german
beers
there
is
plenty
of
malt
there
but
it
lacks
dimension
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
again
but
i
dont
know
how
much
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
i
would
certainly
like
to
try
it
on
tap
especially
at
the
brewery
but
for
now
i
am
left
with
the
aftertaste
of
a
decent
beer
cheers
so
they
are
calling
this
a
helles
dopplebock
i
assume
that
means
a
dopplebock
brewed
without
the
more
highly
roasted
malts
in
any
event
pours
a
crisp
and
brilliant
pale
amber
so
clear
you
can
read
your
fb
page
through
it
aroma
carries
some
tworow
malt
and
not
much
else
vibrantly
carbonated
and
gives
huge
head
that
actually
settles
into
a
nice
comforter
like
layer
of
foam
with
decent
lacing
im
already
impressed
from
what
is
usually
a
subpar
brewer
this
is
like
baroness
blue
record
as
the
bottle
called
it
a
dopplebock
all
in
all
however
its
a
good
not
great
beer
definitely
my
favorite
selection
that
ive
had
from
abita
so
far
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
abita
is
right
it
is
a
beast
one
that
could
use
some
domestication
and
refining
i
probably
would
drink
it
again
but
at
the
price
point
its
at
probably
not
drinkability
is
good
and
honestly
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
even
with
it
higher
abv
while
obviously
not
a
session
beer
it
is
great
for
those
hot
houston
afternoons
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
64
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
pale
malt
slight
grain
wheat
hint
of
citrus
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
maibock
helles
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
wheat
hops
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of

overall
good

nice

this
is
a
decent
dinner
size
beer
it
is
perfect
for
hot
terrible
weather
the
kind
maryland
has
been
seeing
for
most
of
this
summer
d
this
is
a
nice
hellesbock
with
a
pleasant
malt
character
the
hops
in
the
finish
especially
seem
a
bit
stronger
than
average
for
the
style
but
it
helps
to
cut
the
malt
and
makes
for
a
more
drinkable
than
average
beer
oh
well
pours
clear
orange
body
with
white
frothy
head
on
top
aroma
of
sweet
corn
grains
floral
notes
and
wheat
strong
flavors
of
stale
light
fruit
grains
old
wheat
slight
honey
and
artificial
sugar
light
in
body
which
makes
the
unpleasant
flavors
stand
out
on
the
palate
light
in
carbonation
so
you
can
really
soak
in
the
off
flavors
in
this
brew
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
line
from
the
movie
300
but
not
really
sure
if
it
is
even
between
those
styles
that
spicy
german
hop
character
comes
out
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
was
pretty
noticeable
but
the
other
flavors
were
pretty
good

some

nothing

out

nice
beer
i
know
that
can
sound
offensive
but
sometimes
all
you
want
is
something
amiable
this
is
that
kind
of
beer
polite
flavors
i
think
the
mardi
gras
labeling
is
a
misnomer
as
its
not
so
much
a

mild
amount

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
o
while
this
beer
is
rather
malty
its
not
overly
filling
and
seems
to
have
a
good
balance
between
the
different
malts
so
not
one
flavor
dominates
c
yeah
its
been
about
a
month
since
fat
tuesday
but
hey
it
aint
easter
yet
right
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
bronze
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
light
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
mixed
greens
light
sweet
biscuit
and
a
twinge
of
marshmallow
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
only
now
things
are
brighter
more
expressive
and
a
bit
heavier
on
the
greens
but
not
by
too
much
more
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
little
maibock
nothing
worth
a
party
but
a
welcome
addition
to
anyones
spring
lineup
o
not
bad
but
not
superb
about
middle
of
the
road
but
thinking
of
maibocks
i
really
havent
had
one
thats
been
great
to
me
still
worth
having
hard
to
taste
much
in
the
way
of
hops
not
a
veteran
of
this
genre
of
beer
but
it
drinks
easily
though
not
as
complex
as
others
its
ok
but
not
my
favorite
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
these
at
mardi
gras
so
i
guess
it
works
for
that
o
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
but
still
moderately
complex
with
lots
of
flavor
i
will
definately
pick
it
up
again
next
year
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
maibock
style
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
very
exciting
none
of
the
categories
besides
it
look
were
very
impressive
its
a
borderline
below
average
drink
the
taste
had
a
artificial
sweetness
to
it
and
the
body
didnt
support
the
style
this
is
a
rather
simple
though
very
drinkable
beer
there
isnt
much
to
report
in
either
flavor
or
aroma
but
there
arent
any
off
flavors
either
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
few
of
without
worrying
about
fatigue
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
once
but
i
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
o
a
ok
maibock
really
not
doing
anything
that
interesting
its
does
its
job
and
thats
it
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
maibock
a
fun
beer
for
the
fest
season
a
ood
solid
bock
not
great
but
easy
drinking
it
has
an
average
body
that
doesnt
leave
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
too
long
overall
this
beer
is
one
the
best
ive
tried
out
of
the
abita
brewery
however
i
was
really
excited
at
first
look
and
smell
and
slightly
let
down
after
finishing
not
that
its
bad
but
it
leads
you
to
believe
that
its
much
better
an
easier
drink
than
youd
initially
think
i
have
a
feeling
the
influence
from
the
hops
would
be
great
if
this
were
fresher
but
its
mighty
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
this
was
certainly
a
smooth
bock
with
plenty
of
character
it
was
rather
light
on
the
palate
but
seemed
to
work
well
as
a
spring
seasonal
pours
with
a
disappointing
head
and
ok
lacing
orange
beer
the
smell
is
malty
slightly
licorice
and
sweet
the
taste
is
malt
dominated
sweet
with
a
licorice
flavor
that
may
be
coming
from
the
hops
not
sure
about
that
sugary
tastes
a
little
like
a
mardi
gras
king
cake
my
favorite
abita
offering
what
is
it
about
abita
beers
that
creates
such
massive
head
a
lighthanded
pour
still
garnered
twoplus
fingers
of
eggnogcolored
head
with
great
retention
on
this
humid
evening
color
was
a
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
malty
sweetness
perhaps
too
much
for
my
taste
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
pleasant
effervescence
that
seemed
to
fill
my
mouth
the
sweetness
was
not
as
prevalent
on
the
tongue
as
it
had
been
on
the
nose
and
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
more
than
i
had
expected
in
fact
it
was
so
smooth
as
to
be
dangerous
as
over
half
of
it
was
gone
from
my
glass
before
i
realized
it
my
my
finish
was
semidry
as
there
was
some
inherent
sweetness
in
it
but
nothing
like
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
highly
drinkable
but
be
careful
poured
this
maibock
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
poured
a
clear
amber
color
produced
a
thick
clingy
head
featured
excellent
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
barley
and
earth
medium
in
body
this
maibock
featured
a
malted
grain
backbone
some
notes
of
caramel
fresh
baked
bread
and
sweet
malt
fruity
esters
from
the
yeast
were
also
present
balanced
nicely
with
spicy
hops
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
excellent
example
of
an
american
craft
version
of
a
german
classic
prost
cheers
overall
fairly
true
to
the
style
which
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
obeer
improves
as
it
is
allowed
to
warm
still
a
poor

toasted

nice
little

bite
provides
a
nice

rich
flavor
a
nice
match
with
a
big
bowl
of
spicy
jambalaya
a
different
brew
here
good
flavors
just
a
bit
sharp
to
hold
my
interest
to
session
pretty
good
though
o
im
not
leaping
out
of
my
shorts
but
a
very
pleasing
brew
nonetheless
will
certainly
have
it
again
ive
not
had
much
of
abita
but
i
really
do
like
it
pours
clear
copper
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
a
pleasant
floral
hop
aroma
and
some
breadiness
the
taste
of
slightly
sweet
malts
immediately
comes
in
on
the
first
sip
this
is
balanced
with
some
hop
spiciness
and
bitterness
the
flavor
is
fairly
rich
but
also
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
very
adequate
i
picked
this
up
in
the
abita
party
pack
and
i
have
to
say
im
pleased
with
this
effort
overall
i
would
pick
this
up
as
a
sixpack
this
is
a
solid
beer
d
i
suppose
it
is
an
alright
maibock
for
throwing
into
a
mixed
12pack
sort
of
an
intro
for
the
masses
but
perhaps
not
the
best
first
impression
as
it
is
a
bit
coarse
and
not
all
that
inviting
it
is
also
bit
wide
of
the
mark
of
the
real
deal
it
does
drink
fairly
okay
but
needs
more
malts
for
the
style
and
abv
alcohol
punch
without
enough
flavor
or
any
real
heft
to
the
feel
gets
to
be
a
drag
and
hurts
drinkability
after
a
bit
overall
this
is
just
an
ok
beer
i
feel
like
the
hops
could
have
been
a
little
more
prominent
o
a
nice
tasting
seasonal
happy
spring
o
personally
i
think
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
session
beer
although
it
is
pretty
strong
for
that
i
would
definitely
serve
his
beer
at
a
party
what
can
i
say
i
like
a
decently
strong
beer
for
that
either
way
worth
trying
more
mild
than
plenty
of
bocks
ive
had
smells
german
malty
and
a
bit
like
a
red
ale
with
a
smililar
malt
profile
flavor
is
balanced
but
definitely
malt
dominant
some
light
notes
of
wheat
and
sweet
fruit
are
present
mouthfeel
is
just
above
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
crabonation
makes
it
feel
lighter
than
it
is
easy
drinking
for
a
bock
but
a
nice
abv
on
it
makes
it
a
perfect
beer
for
this
time
of
year
not
bad
at
all
o
smooth
and
sessionable
not
as
maltheavy
as
i
remember
from
years
ago
ready
to
down
more
when
the
parades
roll
by
had
as
mardi
gras
bock
strong
malty
aroma
has
good
fruity
and
caramel
notes
rather
tempting
it
pours
a
clear
somewhat
dark
golden
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
goldentan
head
that
leaves
some
respectable
lacing
flavor
has
malty
apple
caramel
and
pear
notes
nothing
outstanding
but
still
enjoyable
smooth
texture
has
aboveaverage
body
and
plenty
of
fizz
throw
me
something
overall
i
like
the
beer
seems
suited
to
a
warmer
weather
drinking
activity
goes
down
easy
priced
right
and
its
not
a
bad
brew
to
share
with
friends
not
that
complex
so
might
fit
in
for
the
new
craft
brew
crowd
overall
its
a
quite
enjoyable
brew
especially
for
abita
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
scent
is
floral
and
wheaty
the
taste
is
flavorful
with
a
great
blend
of
slightly
bitter
hops
sweet
malts
and
floralhibiscus
tones
drinks
smooth
and
is
quite
refreshing
my
first
abita
beer
and
i
plan
on
drinking
many
more
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
crisp
malty
some
bready
flavors
mildly
hopped
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
probably
better
suited
to
warm
weather
o
not
great
but
not
terrible
the
abv
makes
up
for
what
it
lacks
in
all
other
categories
dont
go
out
of
the
way
to
buy
it
but
dont
turn
it
down
if
it
is
offered
to
ya
i
didnt
think
there
was
too
much
to
this
beer
the
biggest
flavor
i
found
was
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
wasnt
bad
or
anything
but
for
sure
not
one
of
the
best
abita
brews
but
really
i
didnt
find
a
ton
of
flavor
at
all
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
myslef
but
some
people
did
seem
to
enjoy
it
abita
mardi
gras
bock
is
a
decent
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
clear
with
thin
white
head
that
appears
to
be
lacing
the
smell
includes
a
slight
lemonywhite
winish
scents
the
taste
is
a
fairly
good
balance
between
barley
and
hops
with
a
sharpness
from
saaz
that
is
present
mouthfeel
is
good
decent
carbonation
and
medium
body
make
this
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
some
beads
yeah
baby
a
descent
beer
that
leans
towards
the
malty
side
easy
to
drink
and
would
go
good
with
bbq
the
rest
medium
bodied
abita
bock
checks
all
of
the
boxes
for
the
bock
style
but
isnt
really
special
in
any
way
a
very
decent
bock
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
good
beer
with
a
rich
amber
color
and
a
somewhat
nice
thin
foamy
head
not
too
heavy
so
its
a
good
beer
to
be
enjoyed
readily
throughout
the
day
scents
and
tastes
of
caramel
and
malt
are
noted
but
neither
of
which
are
too
heavy
or
overbearing
of
the
other
but
theres
a
nice
little
bite
of
hops
at
the
end
that
makes
this
a
righttasty
beer
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
it
was
lacking
in
flavor
big
time
im
used
to
bock
having
more
than
just
one
note
but
this
pretty
much
what
this
one
was
definitely
one
of
abitas
better
beers
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
malt
on
the
backbone
simplicity
nothing
else
at
all
this
beer
is
easy
going
easy
drinking
easy
tasting
no
offensive
i
liked
it
o
an
enjoyable
bock
beer
maltier
than
average
for
style
12oz
bottle
from
total
wine
desert
ridge
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
sediment
in
suspension
nice
pillowtop
tan
colored
head
nice
carbonation
aroma
has
some
caramel
a
hint
of
fruit
and
maybe
some
jaggery
taste
is
a
mess
it
doesnt
come
together
like
the
aroma
until
the
aftertaste
at
first
it
has
a
harsh
buttery
hop
bite
maybe
a
little
metallic
note
and
finally
the
rich
aromatic
sweetness
found
in
the
nose
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
finish
is
ultimately
bitter
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
this
was
almost
a
good
beer
a
very
clear
orange
straw
color
and
a
off
white
head
once
i
began
to
drink
it
the
head
disappeared
to
a
thin
film
a
european
aroma
to
it
a
little
skunky
with
caramel
malts
lots
of
malt
and
little
hops
to
note
yeast
cone
out
a
bit
though
kinda
generic
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
of
malts
dry
and
chewy
overall
a
beer
that
is
not
as
high
in
quality
as
i
was
hoping
for
buy
one
i
should
he
able
to
finish
overall
i
like
it
its
nothing
spectacular
or
too
complex
as
far
as
flavor
but
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
crush
a
sixpack
quick
and
easy
overall
a
solid
maibock
not
overly
interesting
but
not
really
flawed
either
i
could
have
several
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
several
other
abita
offerings
i
would
hit
up
first
much
to
my
disappointment
i
just
poured
three
bottles
of
this
brew
down
the
sink
the
beer
while
not
skunked
had
an
awfully
unpleasant
taste
the
beer
had
a
dark
golden
color
and
not
an
unpleasant
nose
but
i
struggled
to
get
through
each
bottle
without
finishing
any
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
crisp
with
a
light
drinkable
feel
there
is
a
smoothness
that
has
a
nice
welcoming
feel
and
goes
down
easy
if
there
was
ever
reason
to
brew
an
easy
to
quaff
relatively
high
abv
style
then
mardi
gras
is
it
ordered
a
bottle
this
past
saturday
at
coda
in
the
south
end
poured
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
tan
color
no
head
and
not
much
carbonation
nothing
really
detected
in
the
nose
taste
was
one
dimensional
mostly
malt
some
sugary
overtones
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
flat
i
drank
this
beer
but
didnt
find
it
pleasurable
at
all
very
boring
overall
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
a
mardi
gras
favourite
a
spring
pale
bock
and
higher
abv
mixed
with
revelry
and
jubilation
makes
for
a
drunken
good
time
but
as
a
standalone
maibock
it
lacks
the
character
that
i
consider
worthy
of
praise
not
bad
but
not
recommended
overall
a
decent
lager
not
too
flavorful
but
solid
and
drinkable
and
good
paired
with
mustard
and
fried
crawfish
d
drinkable
just
think
after
a
couple
of
these
i
might
get
bored
with
it
the
beer
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
nothing
it
has
a
nice
nutty
buttery
toffee
aroma
the
taste
first
consists
of
a
light
lemon
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
wave
of
butter
nuts
and
caramel
washes
over
and
leaves
a
nice
balanced
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
with
stinging
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
well
done
bock
i
could
definitely
drink
this
again
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
its
not
too
interesting
solid
nothing
offensive
pours
a
clear
copper
color
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
citrus
hop
hint
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
maibock
helles
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
citrus
hops
hint
of
yeast
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
body
these
short
coming
make
it
drinkable
if
i
had
a
bunch
i
could
drink
a
bunch
but
it
is
not
memorable
this
not
being
one
of
my
favored
styles
my
opinion
is
perhaps
too
much
on
the
low
side
it
is
well
made
and
drinkable
o
pretty
darn
good
brew
here
abita
gives
you
a
nice
maibock
with
this
one
slainte
and
happy
mardi
gras
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
nothing
here
is
going
to
blow
you
away
but
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
most
problematic
styles
for
american
brewers
to
replicate
but
abita
did
a
good
job
of
it
drinkability
has
an
interesting
fruity
character
to
it
which
helps
the
drinkability
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
but
wont
overload
your
tastebuds
d
4
goes
down
easy
im
going
to
get
another
d
i
have
been
on
a
bock
kick
lately
but
i
would
love
more
of
these
drink
is
good
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
maibock
style
but
this
is
a
winner
of
a
lager
in
my
book
nicely
done
d
the
creaminess
makes
it
go
down
easily
but
the
taste
is
just
too
bland
to
leave
me
wanting
more
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
esp
on
a
cold
night
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
havent
been
a
fan
of
lagers
lately
but
this
will
bring
me
back
pours
a
light
copper
caramel
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
small
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
mostly
comprised
of
a
bit
of
yeast
and
some
bready
malt
a
touch
of
light
fruit
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
bit
more
fruit
along
with
some
grain
slightly
sweet
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
isnt
half
bad
nothig
great
about
this
but
it
is
an
easy
sipper
d
i
could
drink
this
but
wouldnt
buy
it
o
abita
mardi
gras
bock
does
a
good
job
of
delivering
a
little
more
alcohol
in
a
smooth
and
familiar
package
to
those
who
might
bingedrink
the
yellow
fizzy
stuff
during
this
celebration
time
a
fine
maibock
the
maltiness
is
there
for
a
seasonally
enjoyable
brew
with
aggressive
pouring
got
a
smallish
off
white
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
hazy
medium
amber
aroma
is
malt
caramel
fruit
flavor
is
two
dimensional
malt
caramel
with
carbonic
acid
a
hint
of
hop
and
fruit
body
is
ok
but
carbonation
is
way
over
done
seems
forced
finish
is
like
flavor
came
all
the
way
down
here
thinking
i
could
get
some
special
abitas
that
i
cant
get
at
home
im
askin
ya
is
this
any
way
to
answer
a
reasonable
question
cant
finish
this
beer
d
a
tasty
brew
easy
to
drink
paired
with
a
thai
dish
gai
pad
nam
prik
phao
leftovers
this
was
probably
better
than
as
a
standalone
sipper
worth
a
try
a
pretty
good
springtime
brew
d
this
is
a
nice
bock
overall
avery
nice
complement
to
a
cool
spring
day
no
homerun
here
but
a
decent
beer
that
you
could
probably
have
a
good
time
with
especially
if
youve
got
the
mardi
gras
beads
to
go
with
it
d
fits
in
well
every
now
and
then
but
doesnt
serve
as
a
staple
d
this
is
a
nice
maibock
one
of
the
better
brews
from
abita
dnot
bad
but
very
one
dimensional
malt
wise
the
flavor
is
fairly
straight
forward
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
limited
choices
all
the
abita
beers
i
had
were
overcarbonated
and
a
bit
thin
in
mouthfeel
perfectly
fine
bee
d
there
is
a
sour
weird
funky
aftertaste
that
i
cant
get
over
it
makes
this
very
difficult
to
fully
enjoy
and
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
i
feel
like
if
rust
had
a
taste
this
could
be
it
malt
flavor
leans
more
towards
the
toasty
side
than
caramely
sweet
there
is
a
bit
of
hoppiness
in
here
but
it
seems
as
though
most
of
the
bitterness
is
coming
from
the
toasty
malts
lack
of
sweetness
hurts
the
mouthfeel
as
this
one
is
kinda
thin
does
have
just
enough
creaminess
once
some
of
the
carbonation
leaves
via
some
swirling
action
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
a
drinking
bock
that
goes
down
very
easy
without
thinking
too
much
about
bought
this
at
the
same
time
as
sn
glissade
and
am
enjoying
this
one
a
bit
more
surprisingly
perfect
for
slugging
down
on
mardi
gras
mornings
before
a
big
parade
poured
with
good
clarity
a
clear
rich
golden
with
a
well
formedfluffy
one
finger
white
head
that
left
broken
lace
as
it
settled
slowly
a
mix
of
vegetaland
caramel
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
a
bit
of
toast
none
of
the
aroma
attributes
come
across
on
the
palate
reaaly
save
some
light
caramel
in
the
finishnot
one
thing
eally
stands
out
really
ehit
started
out
pretty
good
but
really
fell
flat
flavor
wise
d
pretty
drinkable
for
a
strong
beer
this
could
become
dangerous
easy
to
get
pissed
off
this
stuff
not
too
bad
not
too
fantastic
but
well
balanced
spicy
and
crisp
wow
just
found
out
now
that
this
is
6
5
very
hard
to
believe
alcohol
is
concealed
nicely
notes
i
like
that
this
is
drinkable
in
the
spirit
of
mardis
gras
smells
and
tastes
zippy
malty
and
smooth
good
comparison
is
millstreams
schildbrau
only
this
has
a
livelier
yeast
profile
and
a
bit
more
hop
presence
starts
with
candy
sweet
toffee
moving
into
biscuits
and
bread
ending
on
sweet
and
sour
maltiness
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
d
quite
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
abita
continues
to
grow
on
me
d
the
sweetness
is
a
little
cloying
and
the
full
flavor
and
nonsessionable
abv
gives
this
beer
weight
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
in
the
end
its
smooth
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
enjoy
one
or
two
but
more
than
that
and
youre
gonna
be
feeling
it
on
a
couple
levels
recommended
watch
the
highish
abv
probably
best
enjoyed
with
hardy
food
abita
recommends
roasted
beef
or
pork
and
mexican
food
drinkability
typically
i
find
abita
brews
to
be
lackluster
at
best
but
this
lil
bock
isnt
half
bad
if
a
regular
dose
of
cheerios
is
hearthealthy
sure
abita
mardi
gras
bock
has
some
health
benefits
as
well
md
excellent
in
both
of
these
categories
each
sip
leaves
the
mouth
wanting
more
and
i
could
drink
ton
of
these
poured
a
ruddy
light
brown
with
about
an
inch
of
head
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
lacing
around
the
top
of
the
glass
as
the
head
settles
quickly
the
aroma
is
slightly
yeasty
with
a
sweet
malt
presence
as
well
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
slightly
smokey
as
well
the
taste
is
prototypical
to
a
bock
and
not
very
remarkable
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
makes
me
want
to
drink
many
many
more
of
these
probably
my
second
favorite
abita
beer
after
turbodog
and
a
good
solid
bock
rjt
drinks
ok
this
is
very
sessionable
which
is
a
good
thing
but
bud
light
is
also
sessionable
d
i
could
throw
these
back
pretty
quickly
because
it
does
seem
light
bodied
and
i
am
enjoying
the
progressions
of
taste
mentioned
above
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
from
the
boys
down
the
street
pours
a
copper
color
with
basically
no
head
smell
is
biscuity
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
hops
taste
follows
the
aroma
a
lot
of
malt
not
much
hop
presence
in
the
beer
even
though
this
beer
is
half
a
year
old
it
still
tastes
pretty
good
to
me
one
of
the
better
abita
brews
i
have
tried
overall
this
beer
is
decent
to
me
abita
isnt
known
for
great
beers
but
this
one
is
worth
buying
overall
this
beer
doesnt
taste
or
smell
like
much
of
anything
until
it
has
a
chance
to
warm
but
once
it
does
it
turns
into
a
fairly
quaffable
brew
i
certainly
dont
recommend
seeking
this
one
out
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
hue
with
a
light
tan
off
white
head
forming
thick
and
creamy
like
rising
above
the
edge
of
my
glass
aroma
contains
sweet
biscuit
notes
with
honey
caressing
the
senses
and
a
touch
of
caramel
malts
a
mild
herbal
or
grassy
hop
character
just
barely
peeks
through
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
a
mix
of
sweet
and
semi
sweet
with
balancing
herbal
hop
notes
caramel
and
biscuits
drizzled
with
honey
nails
my
description
of
this
brew
clean
drinking
experience
with
some
mineral
water
adding
to
the
complexity
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
never
ways
heavy
on
my
palate
excellent
quaffable
bock
from
the
bayou
drinkability
overall
it
does
the
trick
not
a
brew
im
dying
to
get
again
but
one
that
i
will
revisit
next
mardi
gras
season
now
if
abita
would
just
bring
back
their
20th
annivesary
czech
pils
than
id
be
a
happy
camper
this
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
heavy
bready
yeast
with
honey
and
fresh
wheat
and
a
bit
of
orange
it
tasted
like
oranges
and
honey
wheat
bread
with
some
caramel
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
nice
clean
and
crisp
beer
with
a
refreshing
flavor
and
good
body
its
a
well
constructed
brew
that
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
was
definitely
enjoyable
this
is
worth
picking
up
a
sixpack
of
this
one
rather
than
just
sampling
a
single
notes
a
truetostyle
bock
which
is
fairly
rare
probably
my
favorite
abita
to
date
d
i
want
to
like
abitas
standard
offering
but
these
same
vegetable
flavors
keep
popping
up
are
they
using
adjuncts
or
is
it
just
a
unique
effect
of
their
specific
brewing
process
either
way
its
not
really
doing
much
for
me
drinkability
only
going
to
drink
one
bock
tonight
but
i
think
i
could
easily
throw
back
a
sixpack
during
an
afternoon
on
the
lake
on
the
deck
or
at
the
golf
course
i
am
somewhat
of
an
abita
homer
i
am
a
fan
of
their
offerings
save
the
purple
haze
i
was
glad
to
find
the
bock
while
spring
brew
shopping
overall
abita
bock
is
a
pretty
tasting
bock
but
i
believe
that
its
characteristics
makes
it
must
more
sessionable
then
most
bocks
i
have
consumed
drinkability
is
dead
on
seasonable
perfect
spring
celebration
beer
from
an
abita
select
handle
in
its
home
state
was
told
this
was
the
doppelbock
but
this
seems
to
fit
the
appearance
and
availability

mostly
clear
but
some
floaties

to

a
bit
of
grainy
and
grassy

maybe
a
touch

alcohol
decent
might
try
a
single
again

i
find
it

a

with
an
odd
bitterness
a
hint
of

mouthfeel
is
a

just
ok
as
far
as

but
there
are
much
better
choices
out
there
as

as
bocks
go
i
prefer
my
bocks
to
be
heavier
thicker
and
sweeter
than
this
it
could
be
that
i
should
buy
doppelbock
instead
nevertheless
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
while
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
its
drinkable
enough
that
i
dont
regret
buying
it
drinkability
a
nice
beer
for
relaxing
but
nothing
that
sets
the
world
on
fire
better
than
i
remember
it
but
still
nothing
special
drinkability
good
drinkability
for
one
or
two
but
the
sweetness
would
soon
get
me
to
switch
to
something
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
a
hop
presence
good
solid
brew
but
nothing
exceptional
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
chimes
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
not
because
it
was
good
but
because
it
was
a
solid
beer
from
abita
the
appearance
is
a
strawgold
color
but
the
aroma
is
a
bit
better
with
lighter
fruits
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malts
but
there
is
a
yeasty
aftertaste
like
many
abita
beers
they
made
this
beer
too
thin
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
due
to
no
bad
notes
in
this
beer
i
also
feel
its
at
a
higher
abv
than
their
amber
or
fall
fest
note
this
beer
was
companion
to
a
hoagie
and
followed
a
vanilla
porter
this
beer
did
not
impress
me
very
much
could
have
been
me
surroundings
the
food
it
was
as
good
as
and
as
drinkable
as
a
glass
of
fresh
cold
water
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
sort
of
not
bad
overall
but
not
incredibly
impressive
i
like
abita
and
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
seems
a
tad
uninspired
easy
to
drink
for
sure
but
theres
just
nothing
terribly
memorable
about
it
id
have
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
more
up
d
the
flavor
and
body
alone
make
this
beer
really
drinkable
and
in
quantity
not
big
on
flavor
or
fill
especially
if
you
work
a
little
to
decant
it
which
i
did
on
the
second
beer
good
offering
from
abita
light
bodied
crisply
carbonated
it
isnt
bad
but
im
disappointed
medium
carbonation
but
seems
too
thin
for
a
bock
overall
this
is
just
a
really
average
beer
i
mean
id
take
one
if
offered
and
id
prefer
it
over
most
macros
but
theres
just
nothing
really
special
about
this
that
stands
out
one
and
done
here
ive
had
my
fill
and
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
it
seems
like
our
local
breweries
down
here
like
to
just
tack
on
mardi
gras
to
their
duller
brews
to
make
them
look
more
appealing
d
i
bought
this
in
preparation
for
the
mardi
gras
season
down
here
but
was
sorely
disappointed
as
a
bock
beer
there
are
much
better
offerings
and
much
better
beers
to
get
into
the
mardi
gras
spirit
decent
atmosphere
pleasing
complex
nose
and
distinctive
flavor
it
has
a
very
interesting
sweetness
to
it
but
so
much
so
that
its
distracting
feel
doesnt
do
anything
to
take
away
from
the
brew
either
all
this
and
good
drinkability
make
for
a
really
nice
quaff
overallnot
that
great
too
sweet
muddled
just
not
that
drinkable
drinkable
average
bock
the
feel
is
creamy
and
a
tad
bubbly
thicker
than
expected
but
certainly
not
a
choker
its
a
substantial
drink
with
lots
of
summery
treefruit
notes
very
very
nice
1
dirty
cream
head
retains
at
14
clear
bright
golden
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
slow
moving
bubbles
rising
up
some
lace
sweet
aroma
sugar
candy
hops
buried
way
down
in
there
low
aroma
not
much
flavor
at
all
just
some
sweet
grainy
malt
thin
body
with
carbonation
somewhere
between
low
and
medium
not
much
there
dont
care
to
drink
again
pours
a
smoky
brownish
orange
with
no
carbonation
onefinger
head
of
light
tan
foam
that
fades
at
a
casual
pace
leaving
a
thin
sheet
of
lacing
over
the
beer
and
plenty
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
was
really
excited
about
trying
this
beer
but
was
highly
disappointed
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
on
this
bock
but
it
doesnt
feel
too
big
to
me
its
crisp
its
refreshing
and
it
still
maintains
a
nice
residual
bock
sweetness
another
very
wellcrafted
brew
from
the
gang
in
abita
springs
this
beer
poured
a
goldenamber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
aroma
was
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
was
very
much
the
same
with
some
hop
bitterness
coming
through
to
balance
the
flavor
very
little
lacing
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
good
beer
d
again
abita
makes
ok
brews
but
nothing
special
by
any
stretch
of
the
word
pours
a
very
darker
amber
brown
no
head
nose
is
crisp
and
airy
and
apples
flavor
is
very
sugary
sweet
too
much
so
in
my
opinion
on
the
end
an
out
of
place
metallic
tone
bordering
on
burnt
caramel
is
there
too
feel
is
extremely
sticky
and
thick
on
the
liquid
and
very
low
on
the
carbonation
i
have
to
say
that
overall
you
can
drink
this
one
but
i
dont
really
see
any
good
reason
to
leaning
way
too
far
to
one
side
it
doesnt
deliver
a
balanced
and
worthy
experience
pours
a
orangish
gold
color
thick
head
on
the
pour
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
is
weak
with
a
faint
toffee
smell
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
nothing
exceptional
a
sweet
malt
flavor
up
front
with
faint
hop
bite
at
the
end
not
a
bad
bock
just
nothing
outstanding
about
it
drinkability
this
is
really
good
the
slight
malt
finish
reminds
me
of
spaten
oktoberfest
its
not
as
strong
as
spaten
it
hints
at
that
flavor
i
actually
expected
something
like
shiner
bock
when
i
bought
this
its
more
european
in
feel
than
shiner
it
is
a
more
malty
less
grainy
shiner
bock
which
is
also
barely
a
bock
12
oz
stubby
bottle
best
before
73
2007
i
would
presume
it
pours
a
lightlycarbonated
goldentopaz
with
a
finger
of
frothy
beige
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
fine
collar
the
bouquet
is
lightly
sweet
with
hints
of
fruit
or
jam
apricot
banana
and
maybe
some
white
wine
which
seems
a
bit
strange
its
flavor
is
very
clean
with
lightly
spicygrassy
hops
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
cherry
koolaid
fruitiness
which
also
seems
a
bit
strange
the
body
is
medium
fairly
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
a
fleeting
finish
ok
at
best
not
really
worth
seeking
out
a
great
session
beer
on
a
warm
springs
day
d
i
sampled
this
on
a
beautiful
springlike
day
but
it
really
wasnt
anything
worth
waiting
for
in
the
springbock
category
ill
stick
with
saint
arnold
drinks
okay
a
very
dulled
down
version
of
a
bock
still
glad
to
see
something
different
from
these
guys
i
remember
when
these
guys
were
the
the
only
southern
craft
beer
i
could
get
as
long
a
youre
not
too
pedantic
about
style
or
malt
this
is
an
alright
warm
weather
sessioner
laissez
les
bons
temps
rouler
anyway
give
it
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head

small
bubbles
but
the
head
doesnt
last
long
the
smell
is
quite
malty

with
sweet
and
sour
hints
the
taste
is
malty
but
not
sweet
the
hops
are
noticeable
and
balance
out
the
beer
well
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slightly
creamy
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
i
would
consider
a
favorite
during
the
season
a
fairly
poor
example
of
the
bock
style
but
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
bock
however
it
seems
to
be
a
little
more
tame
than
other
beers
in
this
style
try
it
for
yourself
medium
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
slowly
diminishing
head
smell
is
bready
and
fruity
with
grape
being
the
most
notable
aroma
the
taste
is
also
quite
juicy
both
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
fruitiness
is
accompanied
by
some
buttery
malt
light
caramel
and
light
spicy
hops
rather
odd
but
oddly
enjoyable
overall
impression
solid
beer
no
obvious
flaws
nice
nutty
base
noticeable
but
restrained
hops
clean
with
a
great
color
glad
to
see
abita
can
still
kick
out
a
solid
beer
overall
intriguing
flavor
creamy
mouth
and
matching
creamsoda
taste
is
a
plus
surprisingly
nice
comming
from
abita
but
still
not
a
strong
contender
for
its
style
has
some
nice
bock
characters
a
strong
malt
dark
malt
flavor
but
not
the
body
or
viscocity
ok
head
retention
but
quickly
fleeting
has
a
strong
malty
aroma
and
flavor
with
no
supporting
melding
aging
complexity
or
strength
lighly
syrupy
flavored
with
hops
for
bittering
and
maybe
an
earthy
flaovr
and
aroma
a
little
nutty
and
woody
body
is
quite
light
for
style
with
over
carbonaiton
leaves
the
mouth
too
light
and
thin
still
better
than
most
macro
bocks
cough
cough
amber
bock
cough
cough
its
ok
i
will
probably
drink
again
only
when
offered
for
free
grassy
aroma
smells
oddly
adjuncty
quite
unexpected
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
a
polish
lager
clear
amber
with
a
tiny
white
head
fore
is
thin
and
touches
on
toasty
grains
and
mild
apple
notes
pervasive
watery
flavor
throughout
very
low
flavor
intensity
its
like
a
bock
lite
drinkability
the
flavor
really
allows
this
beer
to
drink
fast
and
often
i
could
imagine
making
a
big
session
out
of
this
beer
so
very
appropriate
for
mardi
gras
pours
an
amber
garnet
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
sulphury
sweet
and
slightly
of
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
pretty
lackluster
especially
in
terms
of
the
malt
profile
the
only
thing
holding
my
attention
is
the
floral
hop
flavor
and
the
balance
to
the
syrupy
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
neither
heavy
nor
is
it
too
bubbly
or
anything
drinkability
no
cheers2beers
uf
pours
a
solid
copper
color
with
excellent
clarity
and
minimal
head
over
top
id
like
to
see
a
touch
more
head
on
the
pour
nose
is
not
what
i
was
looking
for
i
get
a
healthy
graineyness
not
the
toasty
maly
i
want
to
smell
im
also
getting
a
touch
of
buttery
diacetyl
but
blended
in
the
with
the
grainey
character
not
really
drawing
me
in
flavor
is
a
bit
better
graney
and
toasty
notes
dominate
with
just
a
touch
of
buttery
playing
in
there
i
get
just
a
kiss
of
bitterness
on
the
finsih
to
balance
things
out
feel
is
moderate
with
a
healthy
moderate
carbonation
overall
an
okay
brew
its
not
doing
anything
to
really
grab
me
i
would
like
to
see
the
grainy
character
be
gone
and
a
stronger
toastyness
id
have
it
again
just
not
too
soon
this
is
not
a
bad
special
entry
by
abita
especially
given
their
penchant
for
making
some
fairly
pedestrian
brews
particularly
some
of
their
minor
offerings
id
be
okay
with
sucking
down
several
mardi
gras
bocks
while
taking
in
a
few
parades
on
st
charles
pours
a
clear
yellow
amber
color
with
a
small
foam
top
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
the
smell
is
kinda
hoppy
but
bland
does
every
abita
brew
smell
the
same
to
everyone
else
it
has
the
same
stench
the
taste
is
better
though
the
caramel
flavors
hit
ya
upon
first
sip
i
would
prefer
more
hops
in
the
taste
kinda
weak
and
not
dry
enough
the
mouthfeel
lacks
punch
kinda
syrupy
water
feeling
mouthfeel
of
soda
it
sounds
like
soda
too
there
are
some
good
flavors
here
but
everything
else
falls
short
it
is
just
plain
blah
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
ones
i
have
had
from
abita
well
at
least
for
the
seasonals
love
turbodog
this
years
batch
seems
better
than
the
past
years
to
me
it
tastes
almost
like
a
light
version
of
andygator
opinion
this
is
the
second
time
ive
tried
this
beer
and
i
remember
thinking
the
last
time
that
it
was
an
ok
beer
this
one
is
way
out
of
balance
maybe
they
may
do
better
in
coming
years
but
i
wouldnt
buy
the
05
again
a
light
ambertan
colored
head
sits
atop
this
brilliantly
clear
copper
colored
beer
the
aroma
is
subdued
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
sweet
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
not
really
much
there
though
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
body
that
seems
both
thin
and
slightly
full
at
the
same
time
the
predominant
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramalization
to
it
overall
like
in
the
aroma
this
beer
is
pretty
bland
certainly
there
is
not
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
just
a
bit
uninspiring
this
is
a
better
than
average
maibock
at
least
the
brewers
havent
scrimped
on
ingredients
like
they
do
in
most
of
the
rest
of
their
lineup
although
it
doesnt
thrill
me
abita
bock
is
a
drinkable
springtime
seasonal
and
is
the
best
beer
from
these
guys
that
ive
had
yet
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
light
amber
brew
head
lasts
well
and
exhibits
nice
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
nondescript
with
minimal
pale
malt
and
hops
components
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
taste
is
upfront
with
the
malty
bitterness
and
a
sort
of
off
fruitiness
that
kind
of
wrecks
it
for
me
aftertaste
doesnt
do
it
for
me
either
have
to
appreciate
the
creamy
mouthfeel
here
even
if
i
wasnt
enamored
by
the
flavors
and
drinkability
is
reasonable
if
the
tastes
are
your
bag
i
guess
had
better
maibocks
recently
so
this
has
probably
jaded
me
for
awhile
i
like
this
style
the
best
of
all
the
abitas
i
sampled
its
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
a
real
pleasure
maybe
the
swamp
water
cancelled
out
some
of
the
bock
molecules
thanks
to
biglove
for
the
sample
and
the
abita
glass
to
enjoy
it
in
not
too
drinkable
though
the
bitter
edge
gets
annoying
after
half
a
bottles
worth
is
done
and
there
is
no
overall
hop
mouthfeel
or
anything
to
match
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
aroma
has
some
faint
caramel
and
some
apple
taste
is
nice
for
a
bock
crisp
and
clean
with
hints
of
caramel
apple
and
lightly
toasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
hint
of
spicyness
on
the
tongue
extremely
drinkable
one
of
abitas
better
ales
abita
bock
is
amberorange
in
color
with
decent
head
the
aroma
is
invitingly
malty
but
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
is
malty
primarily
caramel
not
very
strong
or
complex
a
slight
rawness
is
a
little
bit
annoying
perhaps
it
is
actually
the
metallic
taste
ive
be
reading
about
nonetheless
i
found
this
enjoyable
in
the
same
way
i
find
most
other
abita
beers
enjoyable
as
aboveaverage
easytodrink
beers
p
s
i
have
noticed
that
some
people
have
detected
metallic
or
musty
flavors
or
aromas
in
the
beer
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
was
lucky
to
get
this
beer
super
fresh
there
were
no
off
flavors
at
all
and
i
can
only
hope
that
more
people
will
see
how
great
a
bock
this
is
when
they
get
to
try
it
fresh
i
dont
know
why
everybody
keeps
talking
about
a
golden
color
mine
was
dark
amber
thats
weird
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
clear
gold
in
color
i
was
expecting
a
more
vivid
color
this
is
dull
even
for
a
pale
bock
a
head
of
one
finger
in
height
topped
off
the
beer
the
head
retention
was
fair
after
a
few
moments
it
faded
to
a
small
cap
and
then
a
soapy
collar
sparse
in
the
middle
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
the
appearance
is
bland
the
nose
is
sweet
and
grainy
but
clean
and
fruity
lightly
toasty
at
the
back
with
a
musty
undercurrent
that
reminds
me
of
every
millstream
beer
not
a
pleasant
reminder
the
potency
is
moderate
while
i
cant
call
the
bouquet
inviting
i
wouldnt
call
it
offensive
either
the
palate
is
tasty
there
is
no
getting
around
that
it
is
much
better
than
the
nose
indicated
the
sweetness
is
ideal
and
it
is
not
weak
or
wavering
rather
firm
actually
the
toastiness
is
faint
but
noticeable
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
middle
that
is
pleasantly
coupled
with
some
fruity
flavors
there
are
no
distinct
fruits
just
a
nice
marmalade
the
finish
is
the
home
of
the
hops
light
hints
of
saaz
i
think
and
just
the
slightest
taste
of
alcohol
i
actually
got
a
little
belly
warmth
out
of
this
beer
cool
i
mean
warm
i
mean
whatever
the
aftertaste
is
long
but
clean
something
to
be
expected
or
at
least
desired
for
the
style
mediummediumlight
in
body
low
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
but
ordinary
i
havent
had
many
abita
beers
but
this
dandy
is
the
best
thus
far
i
would
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
if
it
were
found
locally
but
it
is
not
thanks
morris729
for
the
bottle
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
its
kinda
between
a
kolsch
in
its
carbonation
mouthfeel
and
dryness
and
kinda
like
a
helles
or
dortmunder
otherwise
either
way
its
not
very
impressive
one
is
plenty
enough
for
me
would
probably
be
better
icecold
beer
is
good
happy
grainy
brewing
this
beer
i
would
put
in
the
top
three
of
the
abita
offerings
behind
turbodog
and
their
amber
ale
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
has
a
great
malty
nose
followed
up
by
a
clean
malty
flavor
i
had
the
priveledge
of
drinking
a
couple
of
pints
at
the
abita
springs
brewpub
and
would
highly
recommend
making
the
trip
if
you
are
ever
in
the
new
orleans
area
pours
with
a
thick
head
but
very
thin
lacing
and
almost
no
head
retention
golden
color
heavy
carbination
but
not
too
much
very
light
aroma
hint
of
champagne
in
the
scent
and
there
is
an
almost
sweet
champagne
taste
in
there
too
somewhere
maybe
it
is
apple
juice
sparkling
cider
slight
bite
in
there
light
bitterness
that
is
left
in
your
mouth
afterwards
light
tasting
beer
smooth
would
be
good
for
hot
days
in
the
sun
goes
down
easy
one
of
the
better
of
the
abitas
abita
bock
a
nice
tasting
maibock
from
abita
in
fact
this
is
probably
my
favorite
abita
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
with
just
a
hint
of
red
around
the
edges
not
much
head
but
what
it
had
was
a
wee
bit
sticky
the
taste
is
very
nice
rich
hearty
malty
maibock
flavors
sweet
and
slightly
fruity
with
mild
tastes
of
red
apples
very
nice
and
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
subaverage
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
a
musty
stench
it
has
a
lager
yeast
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
average
it
is
light
with
a
slight
grainy
malt
flavor
it
finishes
dry
with
a
musty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
more
than
average
carbonation
it
drinks
fair
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
its
one
and
done
for
me
finish
is
dry
w
another
hint
of
german
malt
in
the
background
beer
is
an
appetizing
ruby
brown
metallic
old
malt
semisyrupy
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
the
metallic
taste
really
bothers
me
the
body
of
the
beer
is
quite
thin
but
i
guess
this
is
a
maibock
at
the
same
time
this
quality
adds
to
its
drink
ability
pours
a
light
brownishorange
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
very
thin
lacing
light
malt
aroma
thin
to
mediumbodied
with
a
clean
malt
flavor
smooth
and
a
little
watery
though
the
finish
is
a
little
spicy
and
malty
overall
not
bad
it
just
felt
like
there
could
have
been
more
to
this
this
started
out
looking
pretty
good
then
faded
fast
the
nice
golden
tan
head
vanished
nearly
instantly
and
there
was
absolutely
no
lacing
the
color
was
light
amber
or
very
dark
gold
the
initial
taste
was
pure
malt
but
followed
by
a
decent
amount
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
along
the
way
there
was
also
light
fruit
sense
fairly
nice
flavoring
but
points
off
for
the
feel
which
was
overly
astringent
and
peppery
insignificant
caramel
malt
aromas
pours
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
of
an
earthy
grain
and
lightly
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
shining
through
after
first
taste
this
reminds
me
of
a
bolder
version
of
miller
high
life
with
a
sweet
corn
taste
adjuncts
im
not
sure
about
that
but
from
the
taste
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
it
also
contains
a
perfumey
fake
finish
that
doesnt
settle
well
it
is
a
light
bodied
brew
and
finishes
with
a
headache
this
is
not
a
good
brew
so
far
so
bad
with
my
abita
journey
and
this
one
is
the
worst
im
not
impressed
this
seems
to
be
a
brewery
that
makes
shortcuts
on
their
brews
imo
cheers
anyways
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
good
amount
of
lace
but
the
head
can
easily
be
fully
resurrected
by
swirling
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
stale
and
musty
grains
taste
is
lightly
toasted
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
some
grassy
notes
followed
by
a
mildly
bitter
hop
bite
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
but
its
not
one
i
would
buy
all
that
often
the
smell
is
toasty
nutty
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
the
beer
starts
sweetish
and
lagery
giving
way
to
a
roasty
nutty
middle
quite
fullbodied
the
finish
is
german
bitter
a
little
metallic
some
alcohol
evident
this
is
quite
a
surprising
beer
interesting
this
is
one
of
the
better
abita
brews
the
beer
pours
quite
golden
for
a
bock
the
head
is
weak
and
short
lived
the
nose
is
also
quite
weak
and
only
hints
at
malt
on
the
inverse
the
flavors
do
not
match
the
nose
there
is
a
very
strong
malt
and
hop
flavor
that
stands
out
in
contrast
the
flavors
are
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
the
hop
finish
is
quite
bitter
this
has
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
no
unique
texture
this
is
really
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
bock
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
fairly
good
it
is
pretty
fruity
and
sweet
like
caramel
and
sweet
black
cherries
there
are
not
a
lot
of
dark
and
roasty
malts
like
i
would
have
expected
out
of
a
bock
i
had
expected
a
darker
beer
but
it
did
not
hurt
this
brew
that
it
was
fairly
light
and
lightbodied
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
if
you
came
accross
this
during
the
summer
it
would
end
up
being
a
fine
selection
to
quench
the
hard
hours
of
labor
an
slightly
aboveaverage
beer
all
in
all
abita
suggests
that
it
goes
well
with
mardi
gras
considering
the
deceptive
alcohol
a
few
of
these
would
ensure
that
the
drinker
either
gave
or
received
large
volumes
of
beads
golden
in
color
weak
small
head
malty
musty
aroma
sweet
malty
caremel
flavors
very
sweet
at
first
finishes
sour
bad
aftertaste
i
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
one
not
a
very
good
bock
i
dont
care
for
it
the
nose
is
a
beautiful
push
of
brown
sugar
and
honey
on
the
palate
it
briefly
offers
more
of
the
same
before
it
succumbs
to
a
watery
tasting
mix
of
hops
caramel
and
kids
cereal
a
nice
effort
and
quite
drinkable
the
body
is
hazy
and
orangishgold
in
color
topped
by
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
decent
collar
and
whispy
surface
foam
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
a
slightly
fruity
and
richly
malty
munich
malt
character
thats
gently
toasty
and
sweetish
backed
by
some
bright
sharp
spicy
hops
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
standard
level
of
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
lightly
crisp
but
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
as
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
slightly
fruity
rich
toasted
malt
thats
supported
by
an
underlying
bitterness
its
a
juicy
malt
that
also
has
some
decent
hop
flavor
present
spicy
saaz
and
floral
hallertauer
it
finishes
semidry
with
a
lingering
sweet
maltiness
as
well
as
some
clear
alcohol
easily
and
without
question
my
favorite
beer
from
abita
although
this
bock
offers
some
rich
malt
hop
character
its
not
real
filling
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
wellmasked
making
it
quite
drinkable
very
well
done
and
definitely
worth
trying
id
love
to
get
a
hold
of
this
fresh
and
on
tap
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
notes
a
damn
nice
stab
at
the
maibock
style
a
bit
onedimensional
if
compared
to
traditional
maibocks
but
if
not
compared
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
offering
personally
i
enjoyed
it
drinkable
flavourful
and
sturdy
abitas
bock
shares
a
slightly
astringent
tartness
that
i
find
in
all
of
their
beers
in
the
bock
it
is
well
integrated
with
a
mellow
maltyness
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
would
go
along
happily
with
about
any
food
you
want
to
pair
their
turbodog
gets
the
most
attention
probably
because
of
the
name
but
the
bock
is
something
of
a
sleeper
from
the
brewery
although
a
colder
temp
is
recommended
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
close
to
50f
when
the
fruit
and
malt
is
more
pronounced
i
also
like
the
style
better
in
an
oktoberfest
glass
o
i
read
some
of
the
other
reviews
and
they
all
point
out
the
malty
sweetness
of
this
beer
so
im
pretty
sure
im
drinking
the
same
thing
that
they
are
but
these
caramelsweet
beers
are
just
not
for
me
overall
enjoyable
beer
would
get
again
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
caters
to
a
sweet
tooth
although
not
overly
sweet
it
will
make
a
sweet
beer
lover
smile
this
is
a
nice
beer
odit
would
take
a
herculean
effort
for
me
to
love
this
beer
and
it
wasnt
food
pairing
strawberry
shortcake
for
sure
any
bbq
boiled
meats
grilled
sausage
blood
sausage
rice
and
beans
o
another
great
brew
from
berkshire
fresh
good
lager
ive
had
this
a
few
times
now
and
it
always
just
feels
off
and
way
too
boozy
im
usually
a
fan
of
berkshire
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
superbly
refreshing
but
enough
medium
light
body
with
moderate
prickly
carbonation
love
it
the
beer
poured
anice
old
gold
with
a
white
head
a
little
lighter
than
expected
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
floral
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
to
it
the
feel
starts
wet
and
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
then
goes
light
and
dry
as
the
alcohol
kicks
in
this
beer
is
a
bit
different
and
that
makes
it
nice
the
feel
is
quite
unique
and
very
nice
overall
its
not
bad
but
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
fantastic
brew
especially
considering
the
price
point
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
while
grilling
outside
during
the
early
months
of
spring
when
the
slightly
higher
abv
and
warming
sweetness
is
enough
to
take
the
chill
off
but
not
enough
to
ruin
its
thirstquenching
capabilities
this
one
also
goes
phenomenally
in
a
marinade
for
chicken
steak
or
bratwursts
o
a
nice
spring
beer
tastes
great
almost
4
5worthy
quite
lacking
in
smell
and
the
mouthfeel
makes
me
think
bbc
just
pumped
bubbles
into
this
until
they
ran
out
not
to
oversimplify
but
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
beer
if
bbc
toned
down
the
carbonation
and
added
some
more
aroma
hops
o
not
bbcs
best
effort
it
has
some
decent
flavors
and
i
really
enjoy
the
honey
sweetness
but
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
a
bit
overwhelming
for
a
spring
seasonal
theres
a
lot
going
on
maybe
too
much
in
too
many
different
directions
but
well
worth
a
go
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
was
a
little
put
off
by
it
at
first
my
first
drink
gave
me
an
impression
that
there
were
a
lot
of
conflicting
flavors
in
play
however
with
each
drink
i
picked
up
new
notes
things
that
were
really
accenting
the
other
flavors
well

that
fizzles
to
a

scattered
sweet

overripe
fruits

make
up

the

and
in

this
thing
ends
with
an
extraordinary
sourtart
grainy
bite
that
most
definitely
leaves
an
aftertaste
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
drink
after
awhile
but
i
think
it
is
because
it
is
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
beer
seems
to
be
another
well
put
together
brew
from
bbc
and
a
bargain

this
is
a
really
approachable
beer
a

consistent
at

dirtybeerguy
com
o
i
really
do
like
this
beer
and
i
may
need
to
brush
up
on
my
lager
beer
knowledge
but
i
think
a
helles
should
be
a
little
cleaner
and
be
a
little
less
on
the
malty
side
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
solid
maibock
and
another
quality
beer
from
berkshire
they
really
have
a
nice
lineup
of
beers
and
this
is
a
solid
seasonal
and
a
nice
representation
of
an
underrepresented
style
overall
this
is
an
agreeable
brew
its
a
little
sweet
and
i
think
a
more
noticeable
hop
profile
would
make
this
more
accurate
to
style
but
i
welcome
unique
interpretations
of
styles
so
no
big
deal
i
liked
this
with
a
bit
more
booze
and
body
than
expected

tasty
a
good
fresh
brew
pours

nice

not
much
aroma
a
little
sweet
malt
flavor
is
nice
sweet
maly
yet
not
over
sticky
still
a
clean
flavor
that
makes
a
good
transistion
between
a
winter
beer
and
summer
beer
a
nice
spring
brew
a
really
nice
balance
its
at
first
heavy
malts
but
it
has
just
enough
hops
at
the
end
to
give
a
crisp

style
i
dont
have
often
worth
picking
up
once
in
a
blue
moon
no
pun
intended
cant
beat
the
price
this
has
become
my
favorite
bbc
seasonal
at
3
40
per
bomber
at
my
fave
packy
a
steal
nice
little
beer
drinkability
i
could
definitely
see
myself
sessioning
this
in
big
old
steins
while
i
watch
the
grass
grow
with
my
buddies
try
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
its
a
good
bbc
seasonal
like
most
of
their
seasonals
drinkability
pretty
solid
but
not
really
an
all
night
kind
of
beer
as
it
sits
a
tad
heavy
after
a
while
and
22
oz
is
probably
a
good
place
to
stop
flavors
are
great
and
a
little
surprising
and
quite
robust
and
balanced
though
and
i
will
gladly
look
for
this
again
all
in
all
a
decent
full
flavoured
beer
but
a
tad
too
fruity
sweet
and
heavy
for
what
i
like
from
the
style
and
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
at
any
one
time
served
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
quickly
dissipated
sweet
malty
aroma
taste
is
overwhelmingly
one
of
malt
much
to
my
enjoyment
almost
no
distinguishable
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
and
sweet
a
very
pleasant
beer
overall
one
of
berkshires
better
beers
imho
which
says
a
lot
considering
the
quality
of
beer
they
make
lots
of
those
clean
soft
lager
malt
flavors
there
is
a
nice
subtle
spice
component
that
i
think
comes
from
the
yeast
adding
more
complexity
translucent
golden
orange
color
thin
dense
head
that
was
pooped
by
half
glass
smells
like
triscuits
triscuits
and
orange
peel
taste
is
unmistakeably
a
well
crafted
mai
but
aggressive
take
on
the
style
mighty
hop
spice
floats
atop
a
peppery
heavy
malt
sea
orange
zest
againwhere
is
that
coming
from
one
and
a
half
inches
of
fine
white
foam
capped
a
clear
amberorange
beer
after
the
pour
the
cap
settled
over
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
but
continued
to
leave
a
bit
of
clumpy
lace
on
the
glass
for
awhile
longer
very
malty
aroma
lots
of
toasty
grain
a
bit
sugary
slight
fruitiness
bitterness
is
solid
and
manages
to
balance
the
malt
sweetness
again
with
toasty
sugary
character
light
hop
flavour
a
little
fruity
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
just
short
of
feeling
sticky
average
carbonation
i
liked
this
one
the
malt
was
definitely
pushed
forward
but
with
just
enough
bitterness
backing
it
up
to
keep
it
nicely
balanced
f
still
very
sweet
with
a
lingering
heavy
malty
sweetness
but
no
real
syrupy
sweetness
again
lingering
lager
flavors
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
little
toasty
malt
flavor
the
sweetness
just
doesnt
go
either
it
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
overall
way
to
sweet
and
not
as
much
maltiness
as
i
would
have
liked
but
pretty
refreshing
drink
is
more
on
the
sweet
malt
side
compare
to
other
offerings
of
the
same
style
sort
of
an
american
twist
to
style
similar
to
what
american
brewers
did
to
the
ipa
i
always
look
forward
to
this
offering
from
bbc
in
the
spring
only
hope
they
would
offer
a
big
ibu
beer
in
there
lineup
d
it
gets
old
fast
with
all
the
malt
but
thats
a
personal
view
worth
a
try
medium
body
with
a
smooth
malty
feeling
on
the
palate
the
finish
continues
with
the
thick
maltiness
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
i
wish
this
had
a
little
lighter
body
with
a
more
refreshing
character
to
it
the
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
than
i
expect
for
the
style
im
not
sure
ill
get
this
again
this
season
but
maybe
ill
get
it
again
next
year
crisp
beer
an
extreme
amount
of
bite
that
made
my
face
pucker
at
first
nice
sweet
caramel
aftertaste
to
it
to
balance
it
out
almost
makes
a
syrupy
taste
berkshire
is
one
brewery
i
always
take
for
granted
and
pass
up
yet
every
time
i
try
a
beer
by
them
i
never
regret
it
solid
maibock
though
not
spectacular
definitely
does
the
style
and
the
brewery
justice
dvery
drinkable
though
the
sweetness
might
become
too
much
after
a
while
feeldrink
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
as
good
as
it
gets
overall
a
very
nice
and
uber
malts
maibock
has
held
up
to
aging
as
well
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
more
amber
than
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
collapsed
immediately
and
didnt
lace
really
couldnt
distinguish
much
from
the
nose
other
than
malty
biscuit
brown
sugar
and
very
subtle
woodiness
the
taste
was
a
little
more
intense
but
the
body
was
surprisingly
thin
and
i
didnt
get
that
alcohol
essence
as
ive
gotten
accustomed
to
feeling
from
the
better
maibocks
the
thin
body
helps
the
drinkability
but
the
flavor
didnt
exactly
wow
me
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
muling
this
back
from
vt
for
me
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
the
lager
appears
a
slightly
clouded
honeyed
amber
color
with
a
good
inch
of
bone
white
head
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
quite
fruity
a
mild
hint
of
alcohol
medium
toasted
bread
honey
approaching
full
bodied
and
creamyslick
with
adequate
carbonation
a
fine
example
of
the
style
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
d
this
is
a
great
lager
sweet
up
front
but
balanced
out
with
the
hops
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
this
is
my
first
taste
of
bbc
and
now
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
more
firm
mouthfeel
rich
and
round
decent
drinkability
but
the
roughness
detracts
overall
solid
as
solid
can
be
the
second
best
offering
of
the
day
only
behind
another
berkshire
brew
i
would
gladly
accept
this
one
again
off
the
tap
at
the
scuffer
this
beer
was
a
hazy
gold
color
with
some
tangerine
highlights
the
head
was
beige
the
retention
excellent
especially
as
a
collar
and
it
left
pretty
good
lacing
in
thin
bands
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
crystal
malt
a
background
of
floral
hops
and
hints
if
citrus
the
flavors
were
totally
spoton
for
the
style
toasted
malt
caramel
malt
hints
of
butterscotch
mild
nuts
dry
grains
and
some
light
alcohol
towards
the
end
the
finish
provided
by
floral
hops
was
pleasantly
bitter
and
surprisingly
crisp
for
such
a
malty
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
though
it
did
leave
a
little
oily
slick
on
my
tongue
the
body
was
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
perfect
a
great
example
of
what
a
maibock
should
be
once
again
i
marvel
at
what
bbc
produces
vs
the
cost
for
a
bottle
dirt
cheap
would
not
be
the
operative
term
but
close
head
was
bonewhite
big
and
fluffy
with
fantastic
retention
nose
had
a
light
lagerlike
sweetness
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
characteristic
honey
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
so
smooth
that
i
could
barely
believe
that
i
had
finished
this
had
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
of
foam
that
lasted
for
most
of
the
beer
a
real
sweet
caramel
like
taste
it
seems
like
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
so
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
a
great
sipping
brew
it
is
probably
amazing
on
draft
a
very
good
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
if
its
in
your
area
definitely
try
it
22oz

in
my
bbc
pint
glass
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
fairly
consistent
skim
of
foam
only
a
couple
random
spots
of
lacing
were
revealed
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
fruity
esters
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
little
booze
taste
is
consistent
with
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
at
the
finish
nicely
muddled
with
the
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
lively
with
a
little
prickliness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
one
of
the
better
maibocks
ive
had
and
even
better
on
tap
another
solid
offering
from
the
guys
at
bbc
steve
d
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
these
all
day
this
is
a
very
good
maibock
i
recommend
it
if
you
have
not
yet
tried
one
drinkability
i
really
feel
like
bbc
is
one
of
those
breweries
alot
of
people
overlook
due
to
the
fact
that
their
beers
are
a
hell
of
alot
cheaper
then
some
of
the
others
on
the
shelf
dont
let
price
fool
you
this
is
by
no
means
a
cheap
beer
its
wonderfully
balanced
smooth
and
flavorful
im
really
liking
what
these
guys
are
doing
lately
and
this
one
solidified
that
notion
an
excellent
maibock
that
i
will
defintley
have
again
this
spring
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
nice
flavor
and
body
is
smooth
and
inviting
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
quite
refreshing
very
drinkable
for
6
5
i
had
this
on
tap
earlier
and
grabbed
a
bottle
on
the
way
home
for
comparisons
sake
both
are
great
and
i
think
the
bottled
version
might
taste
a
bit
fresher
actually
imo
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
its
a
just
a
simple
solid
maibock
thats
a
joy
to
drink
i
could
drink
a
crate
of
this
stuff
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
was
pretty
sweet
though
i
think
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
have
a
lot
of
these
d
this
is
a
great
beer
i
cant
believe
the
best
by
date
printed
on
the
bottle
like
i
mentioned
earlier
this
tastes
like
it
couldve
been
bottled
yesterday
either
an
extremely
well
made
beer
or
stored
properly
since
the
minute
it
was
capped
more
likely
a
little
of
both
22
oz
bomber
best
before
100808
and
sampled
in
may
08
brewed
with
german
hops
and
yeast
the
beer
is
an
ambertinged
gold
relatively
clear
some
particulates
in
the
second
pour
with
medium
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
malty
aroma
grassy
with
a
light
dosage
of
green
hops
very
subtle
but
nice
rich
and
malty
flavor
with
biscuity
grassy
and
doughy
notes
green
mildlybitter
hops
a
few
esters
and
just
a
touch
of
ethanol
the
body
is
fairly
smooth
dry
chewy
but
not
heavy
and
has
a
light
hop
linger
a
nice
tasty
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
but
with
a
surprising
kick
another
good
berkshire
beer
it
also
would
be
nice
to
have
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
since
looking
at
other
reviews
im
wondering
if
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
ill
definitely
give
it
another
shot
a
really
great
maibock
pick
it
up
if
you
have
access
to
it
the
taste
is
loaded
up
malts
the
beer
is
quite
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
is
typical
for
the
style
a
lot
less
syrupy
and
cloying
there
is
lots
of
caramel
sweet
malts
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
some
slightly
off
sweetness
and
the
florals
that
are
typical
of
a
bock
beer
there
is
a
little
bit
of
orange
burst
and
some
candied
sweet
flavors
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
gets
much
more
pronounced
as
things
settle
im
not
getting
much
hop
in
this
beer
but
that
isnt
the
point
really
the
beer
is
a
pretty
full
bodied
bock
beer
at
least
for
the
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
has
enough
interesting
qualities
to
make
it
worth
seeking
out
poured
into
standard
pint
glass
yelloworange
color
with
a
puffy
offwhite
twofinger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
smell
of
caramel
and
toffee
dominate
this
one
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
malt
and
i
love
the
aroma
slight
hop
nose
and
a
bit
of
spice
flavor
is
terrific
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
hop
in
the
back
end
this
is
very
drinkable
and
should
be
welcome
in
anyones
cellar
and
in
their
glass
had
this
on
tap
at
the
publick
house
it
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
fairly
goodsized
white
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
sweet
malty
breadlike
aroma
the
taste
was
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
a
little
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
a
good
beer
to
drink
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
very
slight
hop
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
some
hoppiness
and
lots
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
another
very
tasty
brew
from
berkshire
thanks

that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
creamy
layer
of

a
solid
wall
of

with

fresh
ground

honeydew
melon
and
spicy
earth
like
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
the
aroma
with
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
i
love
it
taste
starts
off
with
toasted
caramel
malt
grains
and
lemongrass
once
again
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
hops
are
hidden
but
noticable
towards
the
end
with
a
slight
grapefruit
bittering
effect
medium
bodied
with
a
full
creamy
feel
steady
and
smooth
carbonation
that
fits
in
perfectly
bliss
this
beer
goes
down
much
too
easy
but
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
my
new
favorite
maibock
ooh
and
the
3
25
price
tag
aint
too
shabby
either
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves

on

verdict
easy
drinking
bock
that
you
should
pick
up

beer
for
the
spring
as
well
and
might
even
make
a
good

in

of
a

this
one
in

22

murky

appearance
with
thick

aromawise
some
neat
smells
such
as
spices
maple
honey
slight
florals
and
caramel
has
a
really
woody
dry
overtone
to
it
really
living
up
to
those
maple
smells
however
it
lacks
the
sweetness
i
thought
it
could
have
had
mouthfeel
is
pretty
mediumlow
overall
had
some
really
great
potential
but
was
somewhat
average
d
very
good
beer
overall
one
bomber
is
probably
enough
for
a
sitting
since
this
is
a
little
heavy
on
tap
in
shaker
pint
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin

decent
aroma
fo

surprising
as
i

this
may
be
a
malt
bomb
crisp
clean
first
sip
nice
caramel
or
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
good
finishing
kick
some
hop
flavor
as
well
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
i
did
another
solid
offering
from
bbc
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
much
but
this
is
a
bock
slick
coating
around
the
mouth
decent
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
but
not
outstanding
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
decent
i
love
this
brewery
but
it
was
not
my
favorite
of
theirs
i
wouldnt
get
it
again

taste
upfront
a

of

add
a
minor

to
the

more
complex
than
a

lager
as
those
tend
toward
clean
onedimensional

and
minimal
fruitiness
to
none
at
all
gotta
love
when

make

the

the

malts
its
solid
with
a
nice
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finshes
sweet
with
some
munich
this
beer
is
true
to
style
and
full
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
take
on
the
maibock
style
its
rich
and
flavorful
a
good
drinker
d
overall
pretty
crisp
and
clean
with
some
interesting
taste
notes
i
thought
the
sweet
corn
flavor
added
to
the
beer
pretty
drinkable
this
is
my
first
maibock
review
so
take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
this
was
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
that
reminded
me
of
a
springtime
version
of
a
marzen
overall
nicely
done
smooth
and
quaffable
toasted
grain
gives
off
the
impression
it
was
dipped
in
sweet
honey
as
the
honey
notes
hold
the
brew
together
ever
so
slight
caramel
presence
floral
hop
notes
play
a
nice
supporting
role
to
the
honey
flavors
not
sticky
on
the
palate
but
leaves
a
slug
like
trail
behind
as
it
passes
across
the
tongue
toasted
grains
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
tickle
the
taste
buds
excellent
maibock
from
bbc
definitely
one
to
pick
up
if
you
can
especially
for
the
price
tag
yet
another
great
brew
from
the
bbc
this
brewery
is
one
of
the
most
underated
out
there
a
very
handsome
beer
off
the
pour
very
clear
light
amber
with
plenty
of
bubbles
floating
upwards
dense
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
and
the
liquid
aroma
is
overly
sweet
to
my
taste
and
contains
a
bit
of
a
cooked
vegetable
aroma
perhaps
this
is
a
bad
bottle
that
note
does
dissipate
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
leaving
more
stuff
in
the
vein
of
overripe
fruits
raw
grains
and
light
brown
sugar
on
the
palate
cooked
vegetables
first
off
that
lasts
through
the
midpalate
until
the
sweetmalt
bockish
tastes
finally
come
through
toward
the
end
some
sharper
more
defined
bitter
edges
enter
the
proceedings
just
before
the
finish
which
nonetheless
stays
pretty
sweet
mouthfeel
is
exceedingly
smooth
and
of
the
perfect
weight
for
the
style
brisk
but
refined
carbonation
overall
this
beer
has
some
nice
points
to
it
but
the
cooked
vegetable
notes
just
mar
a
lot
of
that
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
and
seeing
if
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
if
its
bad
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
nice
parts
and
shows
great
potential
if
its
not
consider
me
disappointed
this
brew
was
poured
from
the
22
oz
bomber
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
and
had
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
perfect
sized
light
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
left
some
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
thought
it
would
be
more
chunks
based
on
the
actual
head
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
mostly
about
the
malt
which
gives
it
a
slightly
toasted
scent
but
does
have
a
slight
just
enough
hop
presence
that
reminds
me
of
fruit
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
very
inviting
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
with
its
solid
malt
flavor
up
front
that
gives
flavors
of
toasted
malts
that
actually
seem
to
linger
through
out
a
fruit
flavor
is
also
noticeable
but
does
not
stick
out
i
believe
that
this
would
be
flavoring
from
the
hops
but
could
be
mistaken
regardless
it
complements
this
beer
extremely
well
also
a
slightly
noticeable
alcohol
taste
is
present
and
come
out
more
as
the
brew
warms
up
only
adds
to
the
beer
this
is
another
incredible
offering
from
bbc
again
i
have
not
been
disappointed
by
their
offerings
what
so
ever
a
pretty
well
balanced
maibock
that
is
a
little
too
sweet
in
taste
for
my
palate
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
as
bbcs
oktoberfest
lager
was
an
unbelievable
tasting
marzen
cheers
had
this
brew
again
this
season
2007
and
it
still
is
as
good
as
last
years
seems
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
remember
but
still
an
easy
drinking
and
great
tasting
maibock
i
will
always
go
for
this
brew
in
the
spring
i
saw
how
well
this
beer
had
been
rated
in
the
past
by
other
bas
so
i
felt
compelled
to
try
it
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
good
head
retention
and
a
white
lacing
that
remained
till
the
end
of
the
glass
smell
was
very
malty
with
some
carmel
smells
some
honey
and
the
slightest
hint
of
fruit
as
well
taste
was
like
a
huge
punch
to
the
face
of
maltyness
more
then
most
other
beers
i
have
tried
the
malt
almost
gives
it
a
sort
of
warm
senesation
towards
the
beginning
followed
by
a
mild
hop
presence
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
big
and
chunky
though
not
necessarily
full
bodied
i
would
say
more
medium
in
body
this
was
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
usually
big
malt
presence
turns
me
off
for
most
beers
but
this
one
had
a
personality
all
its
own
apparently
this
style
is
ususally
high
on
the
hops
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
lacking
somewhat
this
did
not
necessarily
take
away
from
it
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
only
did
it
have
a
great
taste
but
it
was
also
a
very
affordable
treat
definitely
worth
a
purchase
cheers
to
berkshire
brewing
company
once
again
man
oh
man
is
this
one
malty
gem
quite
often
the
maibock
style
is
underdone
leaving
it
a
bit
thin
with
not
enough
malt
and
too
much
bitterness
hop
flavor
or
alcohol
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
theyre
more
often
overdone
leaving
them
flabby
and
cloying
but
still
with
a
hit
of
alcohol
not
this
baby
its
rich
and
clean
gently
candyish
and
subtly
toastygrainy
malt
sweetness
is
evident
in
the
nose
some
vienna
malt
is
obvious
and
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
theres
a
light
touch
of
fruitiness
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
a
suggestion
of
alcohol
as
well
but
overall
its
remarkably
wellbalanced
some
mild
spicy
and
floral
hops
are
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
they
definitely
play
a
supporting
role
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
reigned
in
and
the
bitterness
is
just
enough
to
keep
everything
in
line
drinkability
i
found
the
beer
a
little
too
intense
and
thought
consuming
to
be
very
quaffable
but
it
certainly
held
my
attention
a
wonderful
treat
very
nice
maibock
sort
of
the
traditional
german
meets
american
super
fresh
micro
lager
a
nice
hybrid
that
i
could
drink
all
day
thanks
for
the
bottle
pete
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
an
orangish
hue
there
was
some
offwhite
head
that
died
off
quickly
it
leaves
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
with
notes
of
banana
and
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
a
mildly
caramel
sweet
brew
the
body
is
medium
and
the
taste
is
smooth
there
about
zero
hops
in
this
nothing
special
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
pretty
packed
with
malt
and
quite
enjoyable
maybe
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
big
a
part
of
the
smell
and
taste
but
otherwise
a
well
done
lager
bolder
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
sweet
deliciously
malty
bock
style
lager
bomber
bottle
with
area
on
the
label
for
dating
indication
notches
but
no
notches
alas
are
present
pours
typical
light
almond
amber
tan
thick
tiny
bubble
head
and
leaving
moderate
scattered
lacing
bold
astrigent
hoppy
nose
notes
of
sharp
sweet
malts
clean
crisp
and
dry
in
the
finish
typical
well
crafted
brew
from
bbc
seems
all
their
many
beer
are
solid
and
well
worth
a
try
i
havent
tried
anything
else
from
this
brewer
yet
but
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
small
carbonation
in
a
mediumfull
body
drinkable
despite
the
sweetness
since
it
doesnt
last
quite
a
tasty
beer
not
the
most
complex
but
certainly
good
the
body
is
fairly
light
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
ive
been
happy
with
the
berkshire
products
ive
tried
so
far
in
my
quest
to
try
a
new
and
different
beer
every
week
this
is
a
pleasant
entry
whenever
i
mentally
note
to
have
it
again
thats
a
successful
addition
to
the
repetoire
solid
maibock
from
one
the
better
new
england
breweries
d
too
sweet
can
you
tell
for
my
taste
was
hard
to
drink
did
i
mention
that
it
was
too
sweet
good
flavor
but
wouldnt
buy
again
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
my
bomber
went
down
smoothly
and
i
could
have
opened
another
pours
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
a
very
light
coat
of
bubbles
over
top
nose
is
nice
and
bready
with
light
raisin
and
moderate
toastyness
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
running
through
it
all
flavor
is
nice
more
toasty
than
the
nose
the
toasty
bite
follows
into
the
finish
feel
is
moderate
with
a
lightmoderate
carbonation
good
balance
between
the
two
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
maibocks
are
one
of
my
favorite
lager
style
and
this
one
definately
passes
the
test
good
show
yet
another
fabulous
beer
from
the
boys
at
berkshire
i
love
this
brew
it
pours
a
beautiful
copper
with
a
white
head
that
left
some
scant
lace
aroma
is
malty
with
some
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
malt
fading
to
a
short
dry
finish
exceptionallly
deep
flavor
develops
as
the
beer
warms
doughy
malt
some
ripe
fruit
apples
very
drinkable
pours
out
a
hazy
amber
with
a
bright
white
headskie
tastes
sweet
at
first
but
there
is
more
going
on
here
nice
and
crisp
yet
body
is
full
muchin
down
the
lightness
yet
lappin
up
the
darkness
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
yum
this
lager
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
settled
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
tanginess
the
taste
was
tangy
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
touch
of
sharpness
on
the
tongue
the
mild
hop
bitterness
came
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
sharp
and
dry
overall
despite
the
hints
of
sweetness
the
body
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
with
a
tangy
finish
that
mellowed
this
was
a
very
nice
maibock
and
was
very
enjoyable
drinkability
malt
driven
but
it
dries
out
enough
in
the
aftertaste
to
make
you
want
more
a
great
overall
beer
mouthfeel
this
is
the
beer
version
of
0
calorie
fruitflavored
water
essential
flavors
burst
in
the
mouth
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
light
would
be
the
supreme
summer
session
beer
for
me
if
it
was
more
available
here
summer
staple
yeah
drinkability
well
im
on
my
second
log
this
month
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
really
nicely
done
like
a
beefed
up
version
of
their
ofest
pours
a
brownish
dark
amber
with
a
short
creamy
head
moderate
lacing
also
mildly
effervescent
aroma
is
a
little
subdued
with
creamy
malts
moderate
hops
and
grassy
wheat
notes
taste
follows
with
a
solid
foundation
of
malts
a
nice
balance
of
hoppiness
and
slight
fruitiness
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
especially
for
a
lager
unique
and
enjoyable
ive
always
liked
this
beer
every
spring
i
cant
wait
til
i
head
to
the
package
store
and
see
it
in
the
cooler
i
always
buy
a
few
appears
a
light
golden
color
with
bubbles
and
some
nice
swirly
head
on
top
smell
is
very
fragrant
nice
and
springy
like
a
flower
sweet
malty
notes
with
a
really
nice
specific
smell
that
i
cant
exactly
put
my
finger
on
but
i
want
to
say
it
smells
like
apples
or
cider
with
some
candied
sugar
that
taste
is
also
very
present
in
the
taste
sweet
but
thats
what
its
supposed
to
be
doesnt
overwhelm
though
and
i
usually
dont
like
beers
on
the
sweeter
side
smooth
and
creamy
but
light
mouthfeel
and
super
easy
to
finish
a
bomber
of
this
stuff
glad
its
back
on
the
shelf
excellent
beer
deep
gold
color
reasonably
clear
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
settled
quickly
into
the
beer
a
host
of
champagne
bubbles
rises
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
in
an
attempt
to
renew
the
head
the
nose
has
a
nice
malty
character
with
just
a
mild
doughy
finish
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
up
front
the
doughy
character
arrives
in
the
middle
of
the
flavor
there
is
some
citrus
in
the
flavor
provided
by
the
hops
mouth
feel
is
good
it
has
a
carbonated
character
this
is
a
good
maibock
and
reminds
me
of
my
most
recent
brewing
experience
its
very
drinkable
a
clean
amber
beer
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
a
grainy
biscuit
like
aroma
not
very
strong
aroma
the
malty
sweetness
has
a
light
fruityness
in
the
background
a
quick
brush
of
bitterness
and
then
an
alcohol
warmth
settles
in
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
and
eventually
warms
your
tummy
very
close
in
flavor
characteristics
to
some
octoberfest
beers
that
i
have
had
orange
color
with
fluffy
white
head
strong
smell
of
alcohol
cheap
adjunct
laden
lager
smell
with
also
hints
of
cherriesoranges
taste
follows
through
with
aundance
of
alcohol
slightly
unblanced
but
not
horrible
for
some
reason
i
taste
dark
cherries
but
this
kind
of
surprises
me
it
must
be
something
else
but
my
head
is
telling
me
it
is
cherries
light
bodied
and
dirnkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
thin
one
finger
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
subtle
it
seems
to
have
a
soft
malt
aroma
i
pick
up
some
odd
apple
notes
strangely
enough
the
taste
is
a
fairly
straight
forward
bock
no
hops
to
speak
of
it
has
a
strong
malt
background
with
some
dark
fruit
flavors
blending
in
its
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
but
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
complexity
it
goes
down
very
easily
even
at
6
5
abv
the
mouthfeel
seems
fairly
full
the
carbonation
is
probably
a
little
below
average
but
it
suits
this
beer
well
drinkability
id
say
medium
to
medium
high
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
really
take
your
time
and
enjoy
i
liked
this
and
would
buy
it
againvery
unusual
but
i
like
most
of
bbcs
products
cheers
notes
malty
malty
and
malty
for
a
brewery
that
specializes
in
ales
they
sure
know
how
to
go
around
and
make
a
down
right
kick
ass
lager
three
cheers
for
berkshire
to
have
the
audacity
to
brew
an
awesome
maibock
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
dense
12
slightly
offwhite
head
above
the
copperhued
brew
aroma
is
sweet
and
doughy
the
taste
is
heavy
malt
upfront
with
a
sweetness
that
carries
smoothly
on
through
to
the
very
slight
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
the
throat
the
same
sweetness
that
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
little
better
knocks
the
drinkability
down
just
a
bit
it
might
get
a
bit
over
the
top
after
a
bit
all
in
all
a
bit
more
hearty
than
what
i
would
expect
from
a
maibock
and
thats
just
great
my
first
sip
reveals
average
body
with
a
very
fine
gentle
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
malty
sweet
with
caramel
coming
in
up
front
but
a
slight
earthy
hop
presence
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
smooth
and
refreshing
quite
a
tasty
brew
that
i
will
hopefully
enjoy
again
this
spring
flavor
is
big
and
powerful
a
very
full
bodied
malty
sweet
and
tasty
lager
beer
hops
are
nonexistent
providing
a
touch
of
dryness
to
the
finish
mild
caramel
and
plum
moderate
carbonation
not
quite
as
smooth
as
id
prefer
but
not
half
bad
altogether
a
well
done
beer
ive
enjoyed
a
number
of
berkshire
products
but
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
i
suspect
it
may
be
solely
a
spring
seasonal
but
hope
it
might
be
distributed
throughout
the
year
as
stoudts
and
certain
other
brewers
do
with
their
maibock
this
one
has
the
right
mix
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
to
make

very
good

texture
and
carbonation
needs
some
work

a
hint
of
wheat
on
the
finish
a
damn
fine
brew
malt
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
the
style
but
for
me
its
just
fine
this
is
a
great
beer
i
only
wish
i
had
tried
this
in
february
or
march
instead
of
july
deep
copper
with
a
tight
white
head
strong
fruity
aroma
reminiscent
of
sweetbread
and
strawberries
huge
malty
taste
bready
crackery
incredibly
sweet
large
kick
of
alcohol
right
from
the
getgo
but
it
is
kept
in
check
mostly
by
the
syrupy
delicious
malts
elements
of
honey
and
honeydew
melon
as
the
flavor
deepens
a
fresh
crackle
is
common
to
bbcs
beers
and
certainly
part
of
the
profile
here
but
any
trace
of
hops
is
scarcely
noticeable
rich
luscious
and
strong
almost
like
a
barleywine
without
the
hops
a
rare
forgettable
brew
from
victory
i
thought
they
wouldve
knocked
this
one
right
out
of
the
park
actually
a
very
well
done
beer
quite
tasty
and
even
better
than
certainly
doppelbock
options
out
there
this
was
pretty
average
for
the
style
not
really
something
i
would
look
for
again
o
if
this
is
what
a
good
sturdy
maibock
is
supposed
to
taste
like
man
i
have
been
missing
out
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
simple
style
and
a
simple
execution
in
line
with
traditional
examples
easy
drinking
with
well
hidden
alchohol
ultimately
a
bit
unexciting
pours
yellowish
gold
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
bollowing
white
bubbly
head
smell
of
booze
vegetal
hops
and
some
sweet
malt
characters
feel
is
crispy
and
creamy
lots
of
spice
on
the
palate
and
some
raw
grassiness
and
strawlike
dryness
with
some
sugary
malt
characters
booze
is
there
more
than
expected
overall
an
earthy
complex
lager
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
straw
gold
color
body
with
just
a
real
thin
fizzy
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
citrus
with
a
hint
of
mint
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
up
front
then
i
get
a
faint
hop
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
overall
is
well
carbonated
and
good
tasting
onot
really
impressed
with
this
one
it
has
a
weird
creaminess
to
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
anything
german
not
very
drinkable
and
not
something
ill
be
wanting
again
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
too
bitter
for
the
style
and
i
personally
think
it
should
be
more
grainy
and
sweet
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
brew
pours
a
clear
gold
color
bubbly
white
head
gone
quickly
with
little
lacing
scent
is
muted
and
mild
light
herbal
notes
faint
faint
caramel
sweetness
touch
of
wet
paper
taste
a
little
more
focuses
with
lightly
sweet
malt
little
in
the
way
of
fresh
grain
which
i
like
in
the
style
some
herbal
splashes
on
the
back
end
moderate
body
smooth
decently
carbonated
a
nice
clean
take
on
the
style
just
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
grain
to
the
taste
oaside
from
the
alcohol
being
present
in
the
taste
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
this
is
a
decent
brew
certainly
not
the
best
from
victory
however
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
also
my
first
review
so
hopefully
i
get
better
at
them
one
thing
to
note
is
i
just
bought
it
yesterday
and
it
is
a
spring
release
so
it
isnt
100
percent
fresh
o
its
ok
not
my
favorite
victory
beer
at
all
o
victory
did
it
again
with
slightly
above
average
maibock
that
can
be
enjoyed
during
holidays
i
would
recommend
it
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
light
aroma
with
the
nice
and
spicy
malts
despite
this
the
grains
become
overly
light
and
floury
at
times
it
seems
highly
generic
and
unlike
a
true
maibock
with
less
body
sweetness
or
strength
to
the
malts
the
sweetness
that
was
there
is
erased
and
overpowered
with
bitterness
and
ultimately
this
is
a
letdown
for
the
style
and
for
the
brewery
as
for
the
alcohol
that
was
a
different
story
it
could
have
been
a
bit
less
noticeable
and
not
only
could
i
taste
it
during
my
session
but
i
could
feel
it
by
the
time
i
got
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
while
this
isnt
victorys
best
beer
ill
probably
give
it
another
go
when
spring
arrives
just
to
see
if
its
any
better
the
second
time
around
if
anything
this
was
more
enjoyable
than
many
of
the
marzens
that
are
currently
on
the
shelf
o
very
good
helles
bock
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
very
enjoyable
moreys
bottom
line
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
beers
within
this
style
but
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
so
far
another
nice
beer
from
victory
i
would
buy
this
again
and
again
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
on
top
the
lacing
on
the
glass
was
pretty
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
lemony
aromas
on
it
and
some
grainy
malts
also
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
actually
really
nice
soft
and
smooth
feel
to
the
beer
overall
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
beers
from
victory
brewing
o
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
slightly
bitter
and
crisp
beautiful
nose
and
interesting
flavors
makes
a
nice
session
ale
me
thinks
me
likes
poured
into
a
snifter
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
nearly
two
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
that
receded
quite
a
bit
leaving
some
nice
lacing
smell
of
grains
bready
yeast
and
light
floral
hops
crisp
on
the
taste
buds
biscuity
light
honey
grains
lightly
hopped
for
a
floral
quality
with
a
touch
of
fruit
in
the
finish
not
overflowing
with
flavor
but
whats
there
is
good
lightmedium
body
and
quite
drinkable
a
really
tasty
helles
with
a
pleasant
hop
ooomph
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
german
style
beefy
lagers
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
from
victory
it
seems
more
like
an
imperial
pils
than
a
maibockhelles
bock
however
medium
to
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
easily
swallowed
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
but
does
not
detract
from
the
flavors
or
experience
the
body
is
a
good
consistency
but
it
does
have
a
slightly
sticky
quality
taste
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
light
sulfur
note
that
is
reminiscent
of
prima
pils
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
present
but
it
isnt
over
the
top
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
but
still
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
way
to
start
a
hot
summer
evening
o
it
smells
nice
but
that
is
the
high
point
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
i
dont
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
o
a
decent
maibock
but
i
still
have
yet
to
taste
an
american
interpretation
that
really
rivals
those
made
in
germany
i
think
this
brew
would
benefit
from
a
lower
abv
and
slightly
more
carbonation
the
head
crests
over
a
finger
of
some
of
the
loosest
foam
possible
big
bubbles
pop
and
evaporate
swiftly
the
foam
barely
coats
the
surface
zero
lacing
no
beads
just
random
huge
bubbles
has
a
clean
light

noticeably

overall
with
a

produces

notes
as
it
opens
quite
full
nostril
presence
fullbodied
its
plushness
and
generally
weak
carbonation
undermines
the
pepper

it
is

may
be
desired

sugary

close

in
nature
still
feels
obligated
to
add
a
bitter
twist
to
the
end
this
in
spite
of
a
syrupy
mouth
texture
overall
feels
and
tastes
like
a
normal
everyday
lager
sent
to
finishing
school
and
made
from
higher
quality
ingredients
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
and
im
glad
to
have
had
this
one
malty
and
mildly
sweet
st
boisterous
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
victory
st
boisterous
is
a
very
clear
yellow
beer
with
a
dense
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
little
wooden
it
smells
a
little
like
pinesol
and
spilled
beer
there
is
an
almost
minty
character
to
it
its
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
clean
dry
finish
theres
a
little
bit
of
chewiness
or
grit
left
on
the
teeth
it
tastes
a
little
boozy
and
twangy
like
a
malt
liquor
or
a
euro
lager
alcohol
lemon
detergent
and
light
grain
are
there
along
with
an
herbal
wooden
bitterness
that
surfaces
at
the
finish
this
just
really
isnt
my
thing
it
seems
like
it
wants
to
be
refreshing
but
the
alcohol
flavor
takes
away
from
that
i
love
the
beer
but
when
it
is
85
degrees
it
is
a
bit
heavy
and
a
bit
boozy
this
isnt
really
what
i
consider
a
summer
beer
heck
even
the
st
on
the
bottle
has
a
beard
wow
i
just
found
a
new
go
to
summerspring
brew
at
over
7
alcohol
i
cant
believe
how
well
done
this
brew
is
a
good
bbq
brew
or
beach
beer
this
is
some
sessionable
stuff
here
maybe
the
best
drinking
and
tasting
lager
type
brew
i
have
had
caseworty
well
done
victory
i
swear
bill
and
ron
victorys
brewmasters
majored
in
being
german
theyve
emulated
seemingly
all
german
styles
to
perfection
bocks
are
a
style
really
easy
to
get
wrong
theyre
easy
to
brew
too
sweet
too
strong
not
clean
enough
not
flavourful
enough
you
need
really
highquality
ingredients
and
a
really
thorough
understanding
of
what
youre
doing
neither
of
which
are
ever
a
problem
for
this
brewery
watch
germany
now
try
to
annex
pennsylvania
decent
aromas
and
texture
but
there
are
definitely
some
flaws
in
flavor
this
is
one
to
pass
on
fullbodied
and
hoppy
for
the
style
alcohol
in
the
front
and
back
just
a
tad
too
much
for
the
style
as
it
takes
away
from
the
lightness
you
would
expect
in
a
spring
or
summer
beer
other
than
the
booze
nice
hop
bitterness
that
makes
the
mouthfeel
crisp
and
clean
with
a
dry
finish
better
on
the
colder
side
as
the
booziness
starts
to
take
over
as
it
warms
a
little
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
too
but
its
in
the
background
good
beer
though
love
victory
and
their
use
of
hops
this
is
an
extremely
robust
lager
not
bad
try
it
if
youre
into
lagers
or
want
to
try
something
different
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
victory
i
liked
it
at
first
but
as
the
pint
went
along
i
tasted
things
i
didnt
like
if
they
clean
up
the
overall
flavor
it
might
be
more
enjoyable
still
worth
a
try
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
march
11
2012
sampled
on
april
27
2011
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
the
aroma
is
more
grainy
than
anything
else
with
a
malty
note
thrown
in
on
the
side
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
but
tolerable
the
taste
also
comes
across
as
grainy
with
a
light
but
dry
hop
kick
at
the
end
while
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
darker
bock
beers
this
take
on
the
maibock
or
helles
bock
is
an
exceptional
substitute
for
the
traditional
american
lager
rather
than
tailgating
with
a
budweiser
a
name
i
use
simply
for
reference
to
lager
i
suggest
going
with
a
st
boisterous
but
be
warned
the
name
is
the
truth
drink
too
many
of
these
in
the
sun
and
you
will
in
fact
become
quite
boisterous
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
hue
with
a
12
finger
head
that
settles
into
a
collar
of
medium
thickness
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
not
many
bubbles
visible
aroma
has
a
malty
sweetness
to
it
with
a
hint
of
citrus
lemon
with
a
haygrassstraw
note
1st
sip
brings
a
dry
hints
of
lemon
grass
a
slightly
metallic
hop
note
and
some
bready
biscuity
yeast
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
and
there
is
little
hint
of
the
7
4
alcohol
these
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
overall
another
very
good
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
o
drinks
like
a
champ
the
key
with
the
style
is
to
get
it
fresh
and
this
was
bottles
less
than
two
weeks
ago
it
was
almost
80
today
so
this
really
hit
the
spot
notes
this
is
my
first
beer
experience
form
victory
based
in
pa
and
i
must
say
that
it
was
a
good
first
impression
i
also
enjoy
the
idea
of
a
good
helles
bock
as
it
represents
the
coming
of
spring
and
all
the
beer
festivals
that
take
place
in
germany
around
that
time
compared
to
other
helles
bocks
that
ive
tried
such
as
rogue
dead
guy
and
sierra
nevada
30th
anniversary
this
stacks
up
pretty
well
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
it
was
crisp
clean
balanced
but
also
had
a
lot
of
flavor
to
it
everything
came
together
very
nicely
and
made
for
a
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
beer
a
nice
refreshing
choice
after
working
on
the
house
all
day
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
style
ive
had
o
ill
give
it
a
good
in
overall
impression
a
slightly
bubbling
clear
golden
body
with
white
foam
head
that
fades
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
pleasant
notes
of
grains
cereal
slight
wheat
floral
and
some
hops
in
the
nose
tastes
of
cereal
grains
slight
dirty
wheat
a
flash
of
the
booze
towards
the
finish
and
then
a
sweet
honey
note
mixes
with
hop
dryness
that
fades
out
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
crisp
in
mouthfeel
with
a
good
malt
base
and
a
passable
hop
presence
but
the
booze
comes
across
as
stale
and
pestering
this
beer
is
a
mostly
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
slim
head
nice
maltheavy
aroma
the
beer
has
a
slightly
toasted
scent
with
a
bread
and
alcohol
scent
clean
flavor
with
a
prominent
malt
character
a
little
sulfurlike
note
but
otherwise
clean
sweet
firm
body
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
bock
drinkability
is
alright
the
hopshoney
combination
didnt
work
that
well
for
me
but
the
beer
was
not
terrible

flash
and
a
bready
yeasty
finish
that
lingers
for
a
while
on
the
palate
smooth
malty
beer
which
finished
dry
but
nothing
really
standing
out
easily
drinkable
okay
drinkability
not
very
close
to
style
needs
more
malt
more
bitterness
less
astringency
and
a
clearer
appearence
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
clear
orange
gold
thin
white
head
a
quite
fragrant
beer
interesting
mixture
of
flowers
honey
and
spices
not
to
heavy
but
definitely
distinct
taste
adds
a
moderate
bitter
hop
over
a
lightly
sweet
malt
has
elements
that
remind
me
of
honey
not
very
good
carbonation
with
lingering
sediments
which
i
found
odd
coming
from
victory
very
flat
lacks
head
and
lace
am
going
against
the
grain
here
and
say
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
overall
d
like
most
helles
this
one
boasts
good
drinkability
even
given
this
particular
high
gravity
recipe
id
happily
order
this
beer
at
a
bar
on
a
random
night
and
thats
something
i
can
rarely
say
about
any
lager
d
well
done
not
gonna
drink
a
sixer
like
you
might
with
a
more
typical
bock
but
this
one
is
worth
it
especially
in
a
snowy
winter
like
now
and
yet
its
not
like
they
gone
and
brewed
a
barleywine
or
a
porter
or
something
wacky
its
still
very
recognizable
and
i
like
it
anyway
not
the
first
time
victory
has
made
me
a
believer
in
styles
id
otherwise
discard
props
fortunately
this
is
a
winter
beer
because
its
perfect
to
keep
you
warm
its
got
a
warm
smell
and
warm
flavors
and
just
enough
alcohol
to
warm
you
up
as
well
this
one
pours
a
a
muddied
orange
brown
kind
of
like
apple
cider
the
bottle
is
a
little
old
so
the
aromas
dont
come
out
as
they
should
it
smells
of
subtle
pale
sweet
malts
with
light
citrusy
sweetness
it
tastes
very
good
for
a
helles
bock
the
citrusy
hops
complement
the
pale
malts
quite
well
it
drinks
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
im
a
fan
of
this
one
i
normally
dont
like
this
style
but
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
for
7
4
d
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
smooth
another
secondchancer
which
im
happy
to
see
out
here
in
the
middest
of
the
midwest
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
pale
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
wan
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuits
orange
zest
caramel
and
a
light
smattering
of
flowers
the
taste
strikes
a
very
nice
balance
between
orangeladen
citrus
on
the
one
hand
and
buttery
bread
and
caramel
on
tother
good
times
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
decidedly
nice
brew
something
to
kick
back
on
a
lazy
autumn
day
the
tastes
are
nice
and
pleasant
somewhat
sweet
with
pale
malts
honey
grain
some
pepperiness
from
the
yeast
and
some
mild
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
body
is
medium
to
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
fairly
lively
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
a
very
solid
beer
through
and
through
a
medium
amber
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
a
light
beige
to
white
colored
head
that
starts
at
a
half
inch
and
dissolving
away
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
a
malty
fragrance
with
touches
of
bread
and
cracked
grain
finishing
with
a
mild
feint
scent
of
grass
malt
malt
and
more
malt
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
bread
and
biscuit
flavors
those
flavors
last
till
the
back
end
when
it
finishes
with
a
hop
bitterness
of
grass
and
citrus
did
i
mention
the
malt
the
consistent
medium
body
lasts
all
the
way
through
it
leaves
a
medium
dryness
at
the
end
this
is
really
drinkable
the
color
and
aroma
are
classic
for
the
style
the
taste
is
malty
more
malty
than
i
would
prefer
but
it
takes
nothing
away
from
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
spring
and
the
summer
heat
pours
a
slightly
opaque
offgold
color
with
a
white
head
the
nose
brings
a
lot
of
bread
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
some
light
fruit
notes
while
the
nose
is
certainly
quite
mild
i
get
a
lot
of
different
fruit
notes
sneaking
out
from
underneath
the
doughy
exterior
the
taste
dials
back
on
this
a
bit
and
ends
up
being
more
of
a
sweet
breadtype
brew
however
for
the
style
it
style
has
quite
a
bit
of
nice
flavor
the
feel
is
nice
with
a
light
to
medium
body
thats
slightly
creamy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
american
rendition
of
the
style
d
so
drinkable
that
the
7
4
abv
makes
for
dangerous
combination
d
goes
down
easy
enough
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
some
lace
slight
hazy
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
almost
a
caramel
nose
flavor
is
malty
and
hoppy
nice
maibock
the
higher
abv
is
totally
hidden
2
65
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
a
great
maibock
with
a
european
quality
a
german
lager
done
rather
well
by
an
american
brewery
this
doesnt
sell
short
it
has
a
lot
of
helles
qualities
with
a
nice
noes
of
pollen
honeyapple
blossom
sweet
that
palate
is
in
the
middle
with
a
mild
hoppy
brightness
and
a
honey
soaked
hay
the
bitter
is
there
and
just
right
it
tastes
like
a
helles
with
a
bit
of
a
abv
punch
the
caramel
notes
are
there
the
sticks
bitter
is
there
and
a
gritty
feeling
on
the
gums
definitely
having
again
mdthis
is
a
very
easy
drinker
as
most
are
other
maibocks
i
have
had
the
high
alcohol
content
is
alway
a
shocker
for
maibocks
d
this
was
a
pretty
nice
lager
that
was
fairly
basic
but
light
and
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
harsh
especially
considering
how
tame
the
taste
was
up
front
but
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
was
a
generally
enjoyable
drink
d
a
well
crafted
true
to
form
maibock
id
have
another
this
is
a
decent
maibock
not
my
favorite
product
from
victory
but
very
drinkable
d
nice
drinkability
this
is
like
springtime
in
a
glass
i
would
definately
drink
this
again
another
in
the
long
line
of
awesome
victory
brews
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pale
and
vienna
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
and
munich
malts
along
with
a
dry
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
well
brewed
hellesbock
its
malt
forward
with
a
damn
smooth
finish
d
one
of
the
better
interpretations
of
a
maibock
along
with
rogues
dead
guy
ale
not
as
easy
drinking
as
your
typical
lager
the
abv
is
higher
than
average
though
it
was
over
14
bucks
for
a
sixer
tough
to
justify
purchasing
this
too
frequently
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
without
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
butter
and
some
nuttiness
big
malty
flavor
upfront
with
a
nice
creamy
body
followed
by
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
that
helps
to
cut
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
finish
is
lingering
and
somewhat
woody
and
drinkability
is
very
good
i
discovered
this
on
tap
at
the
tap
mallet
and
ended
up
buying
a
few
6ers
this
is
a
tasty
beer
all
though
i
must
admit
i
have
been
on
a
bit
of
a
maibock
kick
lately
d
pretty
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
especially
when
its
ice
cold
this
beer
screams
spring
from
the
top
of
its
lungs
nice
ill
be
looking
into
this
style
a
bit
more
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
i
think
overall
liked
this
beer
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
after
trying
a
few
other
victory
offerings
it
leaves
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
a
heavy
feeling
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
pretty
solid
choice
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
especially
on
tap
in
a
growler
d
a
classic
example
of
a
maibock
the
integration
of
the
alcohol
allows
for
a
sneak
attack
if
you
arent
careful
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
that
7
0
abv
tag
d
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
smell
and
taste
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
when
im
outside
on
a
spring
day
drinkable
as
all
git
out
this
is
sort
of
perfect
for
what
it
is
pure
balance
is
this
really
a
7abv
concoction
drinkability
could
have
sveral
of
these
if
not
for
the
alcohol
which
hits
hard
a
nice
and
clean
maibock
simple
yet
elegant
pours
a
deep
gold
to
very
light
amber
color
excellent
frothy
head
that
persists
for
a
long
time
would
make
an
ideal
ad
for
a
magazine
advertisement
just
from
the
looks
aroma
is
very
clean
some
light
bready
toastiness
no
noticeable
hop
aroma
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
like
with
a
honey
finish
very
nice
display
of
malt
flavor
again
breadlike
good
carbonation
with
nice
medium
mouthfeel
not
too
light
or
heavy
like
drinkability
is
soso
i
enjoy
this
very
much
but
maybe
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
such
a
nice
spring
brew
that
we
actually
went
back
to
that
tiny
pizza
place
in
wb
antonios
and
bought
more
i
have
to
say
that
this
maybe
my
new
spring
goto
brew
very
drinkable
with
a
abv
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
happy
spring
thanks
neil
the
empire
beer
club
d
plenty
here
to
like
but
there
are
some
better
examples
of
the
style
to
be
found
locally
this
did
hit
the
spot
after
5
hours
of
yard
work
i
could
drink
at
least
two
maybe
three
in
a
sitting
and
savor
every
drop
on
tap
at
the
other
side
outside
on
the
patio
clear
copper
color
with
thick
white
creamy
head
tons
of
nonstop
carbonation
very
nice
appearance
fruity
bready
smell
kind
of
faint
sweet
malty
bready
fruity
grape
taste
with
slightly
oily
resin
aftertaste
chewy
thick
feel
up
front
with
carbonation
on
backend
could
go
for
a
couple
gets
better
as
warms
up
and
carbonation
dies
down
a
little
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
carbonated
well
goes
down
well
very
drinkable
recommended
this
is
fairly
drinkable
however
the
abv
is
sneaky
fits
the
style
well
and
is
clean
and
crisp
in
the
finish
can
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
dvery
drinkable
cant
believe
its
a
7
5
i
would
give
it
another
go
it
was
a
good
beer
and
very
true
to
the
style
dark
coppery
color
good
carbonation
thats
much
lighter
than
the
beer
abv
is
a
little
strong
for
the
flavorcolor
etc
but
in
general
it
was
a
great
beer
d
i
would
be
happy
if
this
was
part
of
a
variety
pack
excuse
me
while
i
do
some
research
d
goes
down
very
nicely
i
do
lament
the
7
because
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
more
the
flavor
is
dry
and
similar
to
dark
toasted
bread
relatively
thin
body
for
the
style
but
the
low
carbonation
balances
the
body
nicely
earthy
flavor
like
the
aroma
not
quite
harsh
in
flavor
but
it
isnt
sweet
or
light
like
other
maibocks
still
it
is
flavorful
and
worth
seeking
out
d
very
clean
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
abv
well
within
style
norms
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
copper
color
wth
a
small
tight
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
honey
malt
with
some
light
grassy
hops
the
aroma
was
faint
so
i
didnt
pick
much
up
the
taste
is
of
a
smooth
caramel
malt
and
some
light
pepper
spice
surprisingly
not
much
of
a
hop
pick
up
doesnt
seem
to
resemble
a
maibock
too
much
but
tastes
good
a
nice
full
body
smooth
despite
some
prickly
carbonation
finishes
with
a
very
light
grassy
bitterness
this
might
not
be
the
most
flavorful
maibock
but
it
drinks
very
nice
the
abv
is
well
hidden
st
boisterous
is
an
interesting
bock
and
like
everything
victory
makes
it
is
good
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
maibock
ive
had
several
now
before
doing
this
review
and
find
myself
enjoying
them
quite
a
bit
it
is
not
earthshakingly
good
but
it
is
definitely
a
good
solid
tasty
brew
that
ill
return
to
again
d
my
first
maibock
review
im
not
sure
at
this
point
if
anything
really
stands
out
about
it
but
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
more
not
much
more
to
say
than
that
great
beer
victory
scores
once
again
with
one
of
their
fantastic
german
interpretations
extremely
drinkable
could
be
drinking
this
one
through
summertime
pretty
light
bodied
though
thats
to
be
expected
decent
carbonation
drinks
ok
as
well
not
a
bad
spring
beer
refreshing
yet
kinda
tasty
alcohol
burn
in
the
aftertaste
hurts
it
here
though
d
i
am
really
impressed
by
victorys
endeavors
into
german
styles
i
cant
believe
how
delicate
this
beer
is
especially
at
7
4
abv
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
small
head
cap
and
no
lacing
smells
like
sweet
clover
honey
with
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
taste
has
a
lively
spice
to
it
mixed
with
a
rich
malty
sweetness
also
a
little
citrus
and
a
bit
of
grassiness
via
the
german
hops
can
detect
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
but
its
not
overpowering
bottle
says
full
bodied
and
that
is
not
false
advertising
more
creamy
and
heavy
than
i
was
expecting
from
this
golden
bock
carbonation
gives
a
crisp
bite
which
is
unexpected
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
bitterness
is
balanced
out
by
the
big
malts
drinkable
for
sure
probabaly
not
one
i
would
session
though
i
love
victorys
lineup
so
im
not
sure
why
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
brew
i
can
say
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
to
find
a
flavorful
enjoyable
golden
bock
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
taste
is
of
malts
and
grains
well
balanced
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
brew
drinkability
is
pretty
high
overall
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
absolutely
outstanding
it
reminds
me
of
a
double
prima
pils
also
from
victory
very
creamy
and
smooth
nice
texture
with
nice
lacing
and
an
apricot
scent
gorgeous
refreshing
with
a
twinge
of
hoppiness
on
the
backend
finishes
fairly
dry
dangerously
drinkable
and
strong
this
is
a
terrific
brew
and
i
am
glad
i
have
a
case
of
it
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
bottle
has
a
fresh
by
date
april
of
2010
after
being
poured
this
brew
had
very
little
head
and
not
much
carbonation
being
released
this
beer
has
very
little
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
dry
and
biscuit
like
malt
flavor
a
few
sweet
fruit
tastes
slight
white
grape
this
beer
is
very
smooth
drinking
and
easy
to
put
down
a
few
the
alcohol
is
moderately
noticable
and
relaxing
the
mouthfeel
is
so
light
i
might
as
well
be
water
despite
its
lightness
not
a
very
drinkable
because
of
the
weird
aftertaste
md
light
bodied
a
little
slick
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
a
very
solid
beer
through
and
through
single
bottle
picked
up
at
norms
in
vienna
va
bright
clear
gold
mild
orange
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
with
no
lacing
very
fresh
aroma
straw
and
grass
like
minimal
malt
and
hop
not
too
complex
or
exciting
sharp
carbonation
with
a
soft
fluffy
body
expecting
more
of
a
malt
presence
from
this
beer
than
there
is
slightly
fruity
sweet
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
floral
hops
in
the
finish
not
an
exceptional
maiheller
bock
and
slightly
disappointing
based
on
everything
else
victory
does
but
still
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
a
nice
light
yellow
pour
with
light
lacing
didnt
detect
a
noticeable
nose
a
light
mouthfeel
very
summer
oriented
brew
thirst
quenching
easy
to
drink
a
highly
drinkable
summer
beer
this
beer
would
be
my
choice
for
an
all
summer
brew
thanks
to
the
folks
at
victory
brewing
co
dirnkability
a
yummy
lager
that
drinks
like
an
ale
i
could
hardly
determine
the
yeast
style
i
dont
think
i
would
reach
for
it
again
thanks
for
reading
um
no
boring
too
sweet
and
too
heavy
as
a
spring
offering
seems
to
slot
between
a
pleasing
winter
ale
and
a
crisp
summer
ale
so
points
go
to
victory
for
that
but
not
good
enough
to
look
forward
to
over
a
cold
winter
i
would
feel
pretty
bleak
about
the
change
of
season
if
this
was
the
beer
to
greet
me
overall
3
8
very
nicely
done
here
nothing
crazy
and
outrageous
but
very
nicely
done
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
going
forward
with
this
fairly
drinkable
but
a
touch
too
sweet
would
not
have
guessed
this
was
a
7
abv
without
knowing
dont
drink
and
review
overall
very
nice
indeed
and
very
easy
drinking
had
2
and
did
not
even
realize
the
abv
was
this
high
i
have
not
had
many
helles
bocks
but
i
like
this
beer
notes
a
good
beerbut
not
for
the
summer
finish
is
dry
overall
the
beers
abv
can
be
sensed
and
it
while
the
balance
is
good
i
can
not
see
myself
having
more
than
two
only
because
the
finish
is
so
dry
if
this
is
typical
of
the
style
then
it
ranks
a
ways
down
the
list
for
me
but
it
seems
to
fit
to
style
quite
well
and
i
certainly
dont
dislike
it
d
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
a
bit
dangerous
at
7
4
because
this
drinks
quickly
would
be
quite
sessionable
minus
the
abv
i
found
the
beer
to
appear
a
deeper
gold
much
more
so
than
a
pilsner
it
was
highly
carbonated
with
a
bubbly
head
and
thick
lacing
it
first
hit
me
as
crisp
like
a
cider
in
the
carboation
sense
not
sweetness
i
agree
that
there
were
citrus
notes
which
presented
themselves
more
and
more
over
time
but
it
wasnt
overall
sweet
id
never
had
the
style
before
and
intend
to
return
to
it
in
the
near
future
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
its
flavorful
crisp
and
refreshing
d
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
it
gains
complexity
as
it
warms
does
a
great
job
as
a
spring
ale
d
a
great
maibock
w
plenty
of
malt
the
flavor
is
complex
yet
still
smooth
enough
to
be
considered
very
drinkable
the
taste
ripples
across
the
tongue
and
begs
for
repeated
tastes
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
represents
well
d
really
sessionable
for
a
7
3
brew
this
felt
lighter
than
your
typical
maibock
almost
like
a
pilsner
but
with
a
more
pronounced
sweet
palate
and
heftier
malt
character
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
there
is
a
sweetness
and
hop
to
balance
the
german
schooled
brewer
of
victory
scores
again
recommended
d
this
is
a
good
germanstyle
beer
a
nice
drinkability
on
a
hot
day
another
solid
beer
from
victory
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
medium
carbonation
no
lingering
bitterness
just
a
touch
sweet
very
nice
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
this
was
my
first
maibockhelles
bock
i
was
surprised
by
the
translucent
golden
color
until
i
remembered
reading
about
how
this
seasonal
is
not
dark
like
other
bocks
it
was
pleasantly
sweet
and
had
a
weak
floral
smell
it
was
refreshing
for
what
it
was
but
a
little
high
in
abv
sipping
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
some
nice
initial
head
and
some
good
lacing
excellent
aroma
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
pineapple
aroma
great
taste
sharp
and
malty
with
a
nice
slight
bananaclove
taste
and
a
good
hit
of
german
hops
in
the
finish
that
last
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
along
with
a
slight
pineapple
taste
goes
down
great
the
over
7
abv
isnt
noticable
at
all
d
personally
i
struggle
with
maibocks
but
this
is
a
wonderful
example
that
i
find
quite
enjoyable
solid
all
the
way
around
and
makes
me
want
to
continue
my
exploration
of
the
styel
it
picks
up
significantly
in
the
taste
department
sweet
im
getting
pears
and
honey
strong
doughy
malts
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
and
a
faint
wisp
of
smoke
along
with
the
spicy
alcohol
at
the
end
i
dont
usually
drink
lagers
but
this
was
very
tasty
wellbalanced
a
great
american
lager
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
victory
comes
through
once
again
d
a
little
on
the
hefty
side
while
the
style
can
be
a
little
higher
in
alcohol
it
seems
a
little
big
i
dont
see
myself
going
through
a
lot
in
on
sitting
that
said
its
a
tasty
brew
and
certainly
enjoyable
3

d
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
an
alright
brew
an
okay
lazy
afternoon
beer
missing
that
second
gear
though
d
not
bad
to
style
there
are
better
versions
out
there
but
thats
not
to
say
this
isnt
a
good
addition
to
the
group
a
nice
brew
from
victory
brewing
i
was
a
bit
ready
to
not
like
this
beer
and
it
surprised
me
this
is
my
first
mailbock
so
i
know
i
wasnt
quite
sure
waht
to
expect
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again

i

slightly

flavor
kicks
the
mouth
with
sweetness
at
first
seems
like
a
smokey
tone
lays
on
the
end
as
well
but
mostly
its
the
sweet
that
you
notice
as
you
get
used
to
it
you
notice
the
malty
more
than
anything
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
low
on
carbonation
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
wouldnt
go
at
it
again
drinkability
refreshing
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
crisp
and
refreshing
segue
between
the
stouts
and
dopplebocks
of
winter
and
the
bright
pilsners
and
wheat
beers
of
summer
i
think
the
buildup
on
my
palate
over
an
extended
session
along
with
the
abv
would
probably
limit
me
to
3
or
4
before
it
stopped
being
enjoyable
though
drinking
it
with
food
would
definitely
help
victory
once
again
displays
their
mastery
of
the
german
lagers
this
will
be
in
my
spring
lineup
every
year
really
nice
i
would
love
for
this
to
find
its
way
out
here
to
the
oregon
market
d
good
enough
to
have
a
few
of
these
but
at
7
4
abv
ill
only
drink
one
or
two
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
victory
always
turns
out
stellar
products
a
solidly
constructed
beer
worth
seeking
out
nice
beer
d
a
good
spring
beer
indeed
d
perect
winter
to
summer
beer
winding
down
from
the
heavy
beers
but
not
quite
time
for
full
time
drinking
of
quaffable
pils
and
wheats
great
for
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
copped
a
single
12
oz
bottle
from
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
nice
golden
copper
applejuice
appearance
with
minimal
head
sweet
candied
aroma
with
florals
and
cinnamon
sugars
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
with
a
sugarladen
vanilla
caramel
and
butter
flavor
that
is
ultrathick
and
truly
rich
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
uncloying
and
nonintrusive
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
crisp
and
clean
without
any
trace
of
bitterness
or
alcohol
one
of
the
better
brews
from
victory
a
nice
sample
full
of
character
flavor
and
great
taste
pears
and
grapefruit
along
with
floral
notes
are
also
noticeable
nice
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
relatively
easy
drinkability
that
goes
down
like
sugaredwater
without
any
hint
of
bitterness
or
alcohol
a
topnotch
victory
brew
definitely
recommended
rich
golden
color
topped
by
a
fairly
dense
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
havy
on
the
malt
side
with
a
touch
of
noble
hops
flavor
is
also
very
malty
a
touch
a
alcohol
heat
in
there
nice
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
not
too
carbonated
drinkability
is
very
good
drinkability
for
a
beer
that
a
couple
months
over
due
it
still
made
for
a
good
light
beer
that
would
make
any
spring
season
special
i
would
like
to
try
this
victory
beer
fresh
if
its
this
good
now
it
has
to
better
when
its
not
overdue
d
the
fairly
substantial
abv
is
hidden
very
well
leaving
this
very
easy
to
drink
the
only
issue
is
that
its
a
bit
too
sweet
as
i
tired
of
it
quickly
another
good
beer
from
victory
its
plenty
drinkable
but
the
malt
base
is
thin
and
feeble
thus
it
doesnt
satisfy
the
meatiness
that
i
want
in
a
bock
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
yet
not
heavy
by
any
means
nicely
done
quite
a
simple
beer
but
well
done
nonetheless
victory
brews
some
of
the
best
beer
to
be
found
in
this
country
storm
king
stout
prima
pils
hop
wallop
all
superb
even
though
maibockhelles

isnt
among
my
favorite
styles
i
can
appreciate
a
good
one
when
i
drink
it

but
no
more
than
that

a

glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
out
recommended
another
winner
from
the
guys
over
at
victory
not
a
style
i
see
very
often
but
they
nailed
it
keep
it
up
over
there
pours
a
one
finger
head
that
disipates
to
near
nothingness
thus
leaving
little
lacing
its
an
amber
colored
ale
with
ocassional
bubles
rising
to
the
top
indicating
a
lighter
carbonation
smells
of
piney
hops
but
its
scent
is
well
short
of
an
ipa
tastes
of
bread
and
alcohol
and
finishes
with
bitterness
thin
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
amazingly
drinkable
for
its
abv
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
breweries
and
i
love
hellerbocks
but
this
one
comes
up
as
being
just
above
average
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
strong
kick
that
is
welldisguised
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
this
is
a
great
beer
to
stick
with
for
a
whole
evening
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
light
aroma
some
sweet
malt
with
touch
of
fruitiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
crisp
theres
a
malty
sweetness
to
the
flavor
upfront
which
is
broken
up
by
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
sweet
graininess
is
apparent
toward
the
back
7

alcohol
is
surprisingly
not
that
noticeable
decent
maibock
overall
a
very
drinkable
maibock
just
wish
they
hadnt
run
out
of
it
at
victory
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
taste
is
really
the
same
as
the
smell
but
it
is
more
robust
nice
malt
sweetness
with
some
caramel
and
honey
flavor
and
a
fruitiness
as
well
that
again
i
can
best
describe
as
apple
or
pear
the
fruitiness
in
the
nose
stands
out
more
than
it
does
in
the
taste
good
lager
flavor
overall
and
very
crisp
smooth
and
refreshing
not
bad
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
orange
colored
with
no
head
at
all
just
some
skimpy
bubbles
on
top
the
smell
was
mighty
nice
though
malty
and
doughy
leading
to
a
sweet
malty
flavor
a
little
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
thick
enough
to
satisfy
as
a
bock
should
in
my
opinion
but
thin
enough
to
be
easily
drinkable
except
the
abv
tempers
that
a
little
very
nice
heller
bock
this
one
was
okay
overall
no
real
flaws
but
nothing
memorable
it
does
a
good
but
not
great
job
of
representing
the
style
and
once
again
drinkability
is
a
bit
low
for
me
as
im
just
not
crazy
about
the
style
as
a
whole
if
you
like
the
style
youll
be
into
this
one
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
than
i
was
but
still
ive
got
no
complaints
an
outstanding
american
interpretation
of
the
style
the
fresh
grain
balanced
sweetness
and
just
enough
alcohol
make
this
a
wonderful
midtolate
spring
drink
good
one
to
sip
in
the
cool
to
warm
but
notyethot
weather
this
is
my
first
helles
bock
so
here
goes
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
to
a
lacing
soon
after
pour
that
remains
spotty
lacing
throughout
tasting
carbonation
is
rushing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
such
a
sweet
yeasty
up
front
aroma
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
seem
to
tingle
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
on
the
tounge
with
a
honey
like
flavor
that
lingers
flavor
is
a
bit
onedimensional
not
sure
if
thats
common
in
this
style
but
i
was
looking
for
more
complexity
very
light
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
7
4
because
of
how
clean
this
beer
is
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
gold
color
like
something
rumpelstiltsken
would
make
with
lots
of
very
durable
and
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
very
cerealy
and
pleasant
flavor
is
not
bad
and
is
a
maltcereal
flavor
that
is
neither
maltysweet
nor
cereal
hearty
not
bad
but
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
mouthfeel
is
pretty
decent
and
smooth
not
bad
pours
a
nice
ambercopper
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
tons
of
rising
bubbles
head
disappears
fairly
quickly
and
there
doesnt
appear
to
be
any
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
citrus
and
some
honey
not
bad
taste
is
interesting
definitely
fits
the
designation
of
a
light
bock
a
pretty
balanced
beer
although
that
balance
might
even
mean
a
little
bland
first
is
some
spiciness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
then
the
sweeter
caramel
and
honey
malt
hops
show
up
at
the
end
and
balance
it
out
a
little
with
an
almost
watery
smoothness
feel
is
medium
solid
carbonation
maybe
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
nothing
particularly
interesting
maybe
thats
just
the
genre
as
this
is
my
first
helles
bock
the
beer
pours
an
interesting
orange
copper
color
there
is
very
little
head
or
lacing
though
on
the
nose
one
picks
up
some
honey
and
sweet
malt
not
bad
though
scarcely
impressive
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
light
and
one
dimensional
with
a
pronounced
flavor
of
sweet
malt
frankly
i
was
amazed
at
the
abv
as
this
beer
is
very
light
and
drinkable
if
not
particularly
interesting
the
flavor
became
a
bit
more
pronounced
as
it
sat
in
the
glass
and
warmed
up
but
utlimately
this
came
across
as
a
light
one
dimensional
summer
quaffing
beer
its
fine
for
what
it
is
i
suppose
but
this
is
not
what
im
looking
for
when
i
pay
3
50
for
a
bottle
of
beer
i
cannot
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
maibocks
ive
had
notes
not
a
bad
maibock
one
you
could
sip
nice
on
cool
on
a
spring
day
watch
out
as
youre
sipping
it
nice
and
cool
though
the
7
2
may
catch
up
with
you
i
always
look
forward
to
drinking
good
spring
bocksthis
poured
int
a
pokal
a
clear
medium
gold
with
a
tight
formed
one
finger
white
head
that
settled
pretty
slowly
alot
of
things
going
on
in
the
nose
caramel
sweetness
and
bread
grain
mainly
with
hints
of
vegetable
and
iron
the
alcohol
really
doesnt
show
thru
much
herenot
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
from
judging
other
reviews
yeah
it
has
some
definent
caramel
sweetness
along
with
a
sweet
dough
character
and
green
gape
with
pear
note
but
a
decent
herbal
hop
presence
is
there
along
with
that
vegetal
note
some
grain
alcohol
flavors
come
thru
as
it
warms
a
bit
but
it
warms
you
on
a
cold
40
degree
spring
day
here
in
the
buffalo
area
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
quite
awhile
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
poured
gleaming
gold
into
the
glass
with
some
nice
head
retention
seems
to
glow
very
attractive
brew
aromas
of
bready
malts
tangy
spiciness
and
a
hint
of
alcohols
and
solvent
taste
is
unexpectedly
harsh
huge
rawness
in
both
the
alcohol
and
hops
up
front
not
so
much
bitter
but
tongue
curling
all
the
same
malts
are
also
huge
and
overly
sweet
like
green
grapes
and
biscuits
honeylike
sticky
sweetness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
heavy
there
is
that
obvious
lagerish
yeast
flavor
that
helps
keep
it
somewhat
crisp
and
balanced
but
the
harsh
flavors
need
to
be
grounded
glad
to
try
the
regular
bock
then
going
for
the
double
as
i
usually
do
great
effort
from
victory
poured
out
a
semi
cloudy
orange
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
shrunk
into
a
thin
film
of
blah
the
nose
is
like
fruit
cake
warm
cherry
pie
alcohol
more
lousy
fruit
cake
and
even
more
fruit
cake
why
would
they
do
this
i
hate
fruit
cake
the
taste
is
of
corrupt
malt
singing
with
alcohol
and
fruity
esters
some
prune
and
a
bit
of
dark
sour
cherry
mouthfeel
is
mild
and
tame
finishes
cloying
and
syrupy
not
terribly
drinkable
but
not
unbearable
either
overall
an
ok
beer
worth
trying
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
flavorful
good
beer
the
first
few
times
i
tried
this
beer
i
wasnt
totally
sold
on
it
however
now
that
i
have
sipped
a
few
i
begun
much
more
accustomed
to
the
maltiness
at
first
blush
i
would
have
said
way
too
much
malt
but
it
has
grown
on
my
palate
and
i
enjoy
it
much
much
more
though
it
strays
a
little
from
the
classic
style
imo
it
is
still
a
nice
tip
of
the
hat
to
the
german
style
thank
goodness
all
those
german
expats
moved
to
pa
and
thank
goodness
i
only
live
a
few
hours
away
very
wellbalanced
american
germanstyle
lager
i
wish
i
had
more
background
with
the
style
to
comment
more
drinkability
i
could
easily
session
this
and
would
love
to
have
another
started
out
as
just
a
soso
kind
of
beer
but
it
got
better
as
it
goes
i
bought
a
case
of
this
beer
and
after
the
first
couple
bottles
i
think
i
had
a
little
bit
of
buyers
remorse
but
by
the
time
i
finished
the
case
i
wise
the
beer
store
still
had
more
of
this
seasonal
offering
left
needless
to
say
its
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
well
crafted
brew
sit
back
sip
and

full
bodied

color
with
sparse
bubbles
and
a
meager
head
some
atringent
yet
sweet
fruits
greeet
the
nose
but
not
very
pronounced
a
light
malty
beer
with
very
subtle
nuances
of
honeydew
and
cantaloupe
a
little
spice
hit
at
the
end
from
the
alcohol
this
beer
worked
rather
well
with
some
medium
to
hot
chili
d
a
very
enjoyable
but
deceptive
brew
its
sneaky
in
the
sense
that
the
higher
abv
doesnt
really
come
out
as
the
beer
goes
down
so
lightly
the
enjoybydate
was
actually
two
days
ago
but
im
glad
i
waited
a
few
months
to
try
it
excellent
selection
crystal

gold
amazingly
pale
for
such
a
robust
allmalt
brew
a
loose
topping
of
head
dies
away
to
a
thin
collar
immediately
the
lack
of
head
is
disappointing
the
aroma
is
packed
to
the
gills
with
toasty
grainy
german
malt
very
nice
some
pilsy
notes
in
there
just
a
whisper
of
floral
german
hops
bold
but
very
clean
the
flavor
starts
with
rich
bready
german
malt
more
white
bread
toast
than
caramel
sweet
but
not
overly
so
remarkably
clean
and
well
lagered
zippy
carbonation
keeps
the
heavier
body
from
feeling
sluggish
perhaps
a
hint
of
grassy
esters
very
faint
if
any
softly
hopped
in
the
finish
a
little
dab
of
spicy
floral
hop
zest
ends
off
with
a
crackle
of
carbonation
bread
crumbs
and
vacant
dryness
on
the
tongue
very
good
and
drinkable
save
for
a
bit
of
excessive
burpiness
from
the
carbonation
begs
for
another
sip
one
of
the
best
pale
bocks
ive
had
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
d
this
looks
like
a
small
light
beer
but
it
is
really
a
big
beer
in
disguise
good
flavor
but
i
would
like
them
to
be
a
bit
bolder
very
interesting
drinkability
this
is
good
beer
and
very
sessionable
d
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
mild
enough
for
a
variety
of
food
it
seems
true
to
the
maibock
style
but
i
feel
that
it
comes
up
short
from
being
a
really
good
beer
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
lacking
in
innovation
granted
it
does
seem
like
it
is
a
style
that
shouldnt
be
tampered
with
greatly
but

did
expect

the

the

are

trying

bragging
about

this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
fleeting
coat
of

this
beer
is
brilliant
almost
glowing
the
aroma

with
a
mild

there
is
also
a

really
nicely
this
smells
really
nice
flavor
is
very
focused
towards
pilsner
malt
sweetness
with
a
solid
honey
sweet
maltyness
the
toasted
notes
hit
secondarily
and
this
is
followed
quickly
by
a
very
mild
bitterness
that
doesnt
hang
on
very
long
at
all
i
think
the
sweetness
is
a
little
much
and
the
toasted
notes
could
be
a
little
stonger
for
my
flavor
feel
is
moderate
with
a
very
mild
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
it
is
solid
all
around
and
a
style
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
on
the
shelves
a
vigourous
pour
into
my
snifter
raises
virtually
no
head
only
a
few
sparse
bubbles
around
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
slightly
transparent
golden
yellow
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
and
somewhat
lemony
theres
also
a
touch
of
floral
hops
taste
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
expected
and
in
fact
is
quite
mild
it
does
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
though
theres
not
much
to
dislike
about
the
taste
but
not
much
there
the
mouth
is
somewhat
thin
and
is
almost
noncarbonated
i
wont
be
coming
back

off

reduces

a

leaves

the

adds
to

hearty

a
mild

bitterness
from

that
are
subdued
by
the
large
amount
of
malt
it

with
ample
carbonation
and
is
actually
quite
big
for
a
beer
this
light
in
color
its
almost
like
im
chewing
on
barley
but
not
in
a
bad
way
overall
its
a
very
nice
lager
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
moderate
mouth
that
benefits
from
the
carbonation
again
good
balance
is

very
drinkable

those
nights
when
a
break
from
my
usual
routine

dark
and
heavy
ales
is
in
order
pour
is
disappointing
for
a
victory
product
an
amber
body
with
practically
no
head
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
warm
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
bittering
hops
though
not
spectacular
but
definitely
nice
taste
is
extremely
pleasant
nice
lagery
smoothness
with
a
bit
of

indeed
taste
german
alcohol
taste

pours
without
much
of
a

a
tawny
deep
gold
nose
has
a
mild
earthy
twinge
of
hops
but
is
decidedly
sweet
and
herbal
smooth
and
crisp
with
little
carbonation
but
with
a
mellow
flavorful
malty
backbone
to
balance
the
grassy
sweet
honey
flavors
as
i
said
before
the
alcohol
hides
quite
well
in
this
one
and
can
sneak
up
to
your
brain
before
you
know
it
a
spring
seasonal
indeed
but
one
that
is
quite
refreshing
desite
the

abv
an
enjoyable
sipper
all

when
one
tires
of
the
various
wheats

lighter
lagers
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
of
sweet
grass
as
well
as
light
nutty
sweet
malted
barley
with
a
little
lemoniness
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
the
sweet
matiness
dominating
especially
as
it
warms
there
is
again
a
hint
of
lemoniness
and
a
little
crispness
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
and
fairly
drinakble
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
on
the
colder
side
as
it
is
a
little
more
crisp
probably
not
refrigerator
cold
but
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
the
crispness
definitely
fades
very
drinkable
when
something
heavier
and
warming
will
hit
the
spot
not
a
brew
for
a
summer
afternoon
cheers
drinkability
st
boisterous
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
i
still
find
it
very
drinkable
considering
the

plenty
of
sweet
fruity
malts
that
is
balanced
out
in
the
finish
with
a
dose
of
hops
my
1st
heller
bock
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
again
just
dont
think
i
could
make
a
session
out
of
it
i
fine
german
lager
from
the
folks
at

seek
it
out
and
give

is
slightly
disappointing
smells
spicy

appley
with
a
maltyness
that
comes
as
a
rogue
wave
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
first
sip
i
thought
i
was
getting
a
nice
light
beer
but
the
hop
juice
punched
my
teeth
in
as
i
stumbled
back
wow
this
is
loaded
with
a
great
hop
charater
and
is
followed
nicely
with
german
malted
grains
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
body
is
pretty
solid
and
this
would
be
all
day
drinking
material
on
tap
i
think
it
might
suffer
a
little
in
the
bottle
this
rich
but
restrained
heller
bock
is
a
tasty
one
nicely
dry
yet
pleasantly
fruity
as
well
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
even
though
you
can
get
a
nice
whiff
of
it
in
the
aroma
and
just
a
touch
of
that
familiar
burn
in
the
flavor
i
have
only
one
minor
complaint
about
this
one
the
head
had
barely
any
retention
and
didnt
leave
behind
even
the
slightest
lace
nonetheless
i
certainly
recommend
this
deceptively
drinkable
strong
lager
especially
if
like
me
youre
a
big
fan
of
the
style
like
i
said
i
wont
finish
this
sixpack
off
no
offense

as
the

rain
down
outside
nothing
exceptional
but
a
solid
victory
very
drinkable
brew
victory
makes
a
habit
of
this
this
is
an
easy
6pack
drinker
imo
drink
ability
is
very
high
i
do
like
this
style
and
this
is
a
very
good
example
prost
mk
a
smooth
and
subtle
mouthfeel
to
begin
the
flavors
carry
nuances
of
smoke
peat
and
toasted
malt
mild
hops
counter
the
sweetness
leading
to
a
nicely
balanced
beer
one
of
victorys
finest
offerings
dnot
bad
but
not
great
either
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
bunch
of
these
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
cant
get
this
in
my
area
but
if
you
can
i
recommend
picking
some
up
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
scant
14
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
tarnished
gold
brew
head
quickly
disappears
down
to
a
few
localized
bubbles
and
a
light
film
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
juicy
fruits
and
pale
grains
taste
is
pale
malt
sweetness
with
blushes
of
fruit
in
the
middle
and
a
lightly
warming
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
nice
could
be
a
definite
session
prospect
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
sweet
slightly
fruity
aroma
with
malts
behind
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
good
helles
lager
i
dont
know
where
the
bock
fits
in
but
this
is
a
strong
and
tasty
lager
after
the
initial
sweetness
it
gives
way
to
bready
malts
not
much
for
hops
but
a
very
ncie
beer
great
drinkability
for
the
strength
call
it
a
go
to
beer
for
a
hot
day
when
you
want
a
buzz
ill
finish
the
rest
of
the
6er
but
none
too
quickly
and
without
any
exceptional
pleasure
pours
clear
straw
color
with
the
slightest
amount
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
like
good
champagne
aromas
of
spice
flowers
and
bread
with
corresponding
tastes
everything
about
this
beer
says
spring
and
it
is
almost
like
the
malts
are
young
makes
me
want
another
sip
because
there
is
something
lingering
that
i
just
cant
place
and
want
to
taste
again
another
great
lager
from
victory
drinkability
ill
certainly
be
getting
a
6pack
of
this
soon
enough
as
i
think
its
really
delicious
not
the
most
complex
brew
in
the
entire
world
but
the
best
of
the
domestic
styles
ive
had
yet
quenching
fairly
alcoholic
and
highly
drinkable
i
hope
this
becomes
a
staple
for
victory
as
far
as
bottles
go
overall
i
managed
a
draft
sample
of
both
the
st
boisterous
and
st
victorious
during
my
first
ever
visit
to
the
victory
brewery
tap
almost
two
years
to
the
day
on
29th
may
2004
it
was
great
back
then
and
it
still
is
nice
to
see
it
in
bottles
a
victoryv
salute
to
bighuge
for
the
permanent
loan
of
this
marvelous
brew
remarkably
welldone
exceptional
this
ones
not
to
be
missed
especially
for
fans
of
the
helles
bock
style
because
it
rivals
the
best
from
germany
from
the
bottle
that
i
got
in
a
trade
poured
a
golden
honey
with
a
off
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
aroma
metallic
citrus
lemonorange
hops
caramel
honey
flavor
a
malty
sweetness
hops
honey
fruity
like
the
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
a
good
introduction
to
maibockhelles
bock
for
me
and
ill
be
back
for
more
kudos
to
the
guys
a
norms
in
vienna
for
recommending
it
poured
a
translucent
mediumorange
color
with
a
subtle
yellow
undertone
a
soft
white
head
quickly
developed
and
disparted
just
as
quickly
only
a
touch
of
lacing
was
left
behind
on
my
goblet
aromas
of
honey
grains
fresh
fruit
and
flowers
seemed
to
come
out
the
taste
was
crisp
with
sweet
malt
flavors
dominating
the
front
end
of
each
sip
a
bitter
finish
that
was
slightly
floral
rounded
out
the
beer
a
grainlike
texture
somewhat
chewy
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
blend
of
sweet
flavors
like
honey
and
slow
roasted
sugars
with
citruslike
hop
bitterness
another
great
beer
from
victory
mmmm
delicious
maibock
this
beer
poured
a
deep
gold
with
some
hints
of
orange
it
is
very
clear
with
a
small
white
head
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
not
much
else
it
has
a
sweet
rich
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
not
much
contribution
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
clean
crisp
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
very
good
the
last
time
i
had
it
three
years
ago
there
was
a
bit
more
floral
hop
smell
and
flavor
this
stuff
is
potent
and
smooth
so
be
careful
it
finishes
very
nicely
i
cant
complain
or
find
too
much
fault
with
this
one
im
glad
that
minnesota
has
started
to
get
more
of
the
victory
seasonal
offerings
st
boisterous
didnt
let
me
down
it
is
a
quality
maibock
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
well
into
the
morning
and
probably
for
breakfast
this
is
excellent
wellbalanced
clean
really
nice
this
is
what
i
love
about
beer
what
an
incredible
maibock
perhaps
the
best
i
have
had
highly
recommended
better
than
capital
in
my
opinion
it
smelt
of
apple
trees
with
a
hint
of
hops
it
tasted
like
a
cider
but
i
could
relate
it
too
taking
dainty
nibbles
of
a
freshly
picked
apple
on
the
exhale
there
was
a
hint
of
celery
salt
as
i
took
a
sip
it
felt
fun
and
bubbly
in
my
mouth
all
the
way
down
over
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
not
s
good
one
watery
with
little
flavor
other
than
a
metallic
taste
victory
usually
does
so
much
better
than
this
this
ones
a
little
heavy
but
freakin
delicious
drinkability
whats
not
to
like
it
is
a
big
peppery
beer
well
hopped
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
worth
picking
up
a
6
for
sure
cloudy
light
orange
and
some
yeast
in
aroma
hoppy
citrus
oil
well
malted
carmel
and
vanilla
but
balanced
fine
mix
nothing
objectionable
medium
plus
mouthfeel
from
malt
and
a
honeyish
yeast
refreshing
i
like
the
brewery
but
this
one
isnt
as
exciting
like
i
said
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
i
kept
wanting
more
and
it
snuck
up
on
me
oh
well
i
will
just
have
to
go
get
some
more
poured
a
bright
golen
color
with
massive
white
puffy
head
that
fell
to
a
thin
coating
with
sparse
lacing
smell
is
sweetish
almost
honeylike
with
nice
nice
ripe
fruit
essences
also
present
taste
is
superb
with
a
strong
malt
character
and
a
minimum
of
hops
found
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
too
good
a
drinkability
for
a
7
4
beer
excellent
beer
drinkability
for
a
strong
beer
it
is
decently
drinkable
a
solid
maibock
and
nice
to
drink
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
drinkability
maibock
is
a
spring
beer
and
may
1
is
monday
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
shimmering
golden
color
the
head
is
massive
and
receds
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
grassy
grainy
but
with
a
nice
fruity
background
the
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
between
grassy
and
fruity
and
is
midly
sweet
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
maibocks
i
have
had
to
date
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
whenever
i
get
the
chance
golden
color
slight
bubbly
ivory
white
head
lace
is
adequate
very
nice
aroma
great
blend
of
rich
malts
and
leafy
hops
this
maibock
has
got
some
character
its
quite
clean
but
abundant
with
flavor
thick
malts
lay
down
the
backbone
bready
yet
rich
hops
add
just
a
touch
of
floral
attributes
malts
are
rich
this
one
is
really
drinkable
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
capital
and
town
hall
as
one
of
my
favorite
maibocks
clear
deep
gold
colour
my
pint
was
poured
with
a
thin
whisp
of
head
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
rich
toasted
malt
aroma
with
fresh
apple
character
very
nice
malty
sweet
with
toasted
malts
and
a
caramel
apple
component
it
had
a
lingering
light
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
hop
flavour
there
was
a
noticeable
acidic
bite
from
the
carbonation
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
light
spicy
alcohol
warmth
carbonation
was
just
on
the
high
side
made
up
of
large
fizzy
bubbles
decent
body
quite
smooth
once
the
carbonation
settled
a
bit
a
good
beer
and
quite
quaffable
drinkabililty
this
is
no
means
a
session
brew
but
the
glass
i
had
went
down
smooth
and
rather
quickly
could
have
easily
had
another
but
there
were
other
interesting
things
on
tap
i
wanted
to
try
great
beer
for
springtime
in
the
midatlantic
clear
bright
gold
appearance
head
is
fairly
minimal
and
is
essentially
gone
after
45
seconds
or
so
a
couple
of
strings
for
lacing
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
much
more
of
a
slightly
bitter
apple
core
and
slushy
cinnamon
sweetend
apple
sauce
that
plays
very
well
body
is
heavier
carbonation
is
at
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
taste
is
quite
malty
viscous
with
an
almost
maple
syrup
sweetness
hops
give
a
slightly
leafy
and
peppery
counterpoint
i
kind
of
like
them
to
pop
more
in
this
style
and
nicely
emphasized
in
the
second
half
of
the
flavor
profile
toasted
malt
impression
gets
stronger
on
warming
and
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
a
slightly
too
thick
brew
nice
balance
and
a
pleasant
rendition
of
a
strong
helles
bock
a
pale
bright
orange
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
has
some
nice
floral
notes
and
honey
and
something
that
reminds
me
of
leather
honey
is
first
in
the
flavor
followed
by
a
light
hop
bitterness
also
seems
to
be
a
slight
spice
to
this
along
with
some
cereallike
malt
sweetness
medium
bodies
slightly
dry
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
enjoyable
beers
had
this
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
munich
gold
when
served
it
came
toped
with
a
low
head
i
thought
the
aroma
was
spot
on
really
authentic
german
bier
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
there
is
some
initial
sweetness
but
then
some
nice
thick
malts
make
an
appearance
needless
to
say
i
had
more
than
one
very
drinkable
this
was
another
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
just
seemed
to
evaporate
upon
contact
with
the
air
it
was
a
crystalclear
goldenyellow
with
just
a
wisp
of
a
head
remaining
it
had
a
huge
malty
nose
my
notes
at
this
point
have
the
remark
now
were
gettin
somewhere
there
was
a
good
sweetmalty
taste
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
was
also
sweet
but
it
reminded
me
of
hay
or
silage
youd
have
to
be
a
farmer
or
spent
time
around
a
farm
there
was
a
mild
lingering
bitterness
in
the
mouth
as
the
beer
warmed
the
longer
i
went
the
more
i
got
a
strong
flavor
of
honey
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
the
abv
and
the
sweetness
make
it
one
that
two
would
probably
be
plenty
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
moderate
carbonation
this
has
a
rather
viscous
body
but
doesnt
cloy
its
easy
to
drink
although
the
sheer
bulk
might
keep
you
from
having
too
many
still
its
a
really
nice
beer
with
which
to
shake
off
the
winter
and
embrace
the
spring
beer
is
very
nice
and
refreshing
i
kinda
wish
i
had
let
it
chill
longer
as
i
think
it
is
prob
even
better
colder
another
nice
brew
from
the
guys
in
downingtown
ill
have
to
try
another
soon
to
see
if
the
carbonation
thing
was
a
fluke
or
not
if
you
like
i
do
enjoy
different
sensations
of
taste
throught
a
beer
give
this
a
try
another
winner
from
v
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
smallish
pillowy
white
head
head
retention
is
poor
but
leaves
a
light
scattering
of
lace
light
malt
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
light
fruit
notes
and
a
few
other
things
going
on
some
bready
notes
as
well
flavor
is
sweet
and
bready
with
some
apple
notes
light
hoppiness
rounds
this
one
out
nicely
crisp
and
refreshing
going
down
this
stuff
is
very
easy
drinking
and
perfect
for
the
warm
weather
thanks
goes
to
ben
for
the
bottles
of
this
crystal
clear
and
golden
just
a
film
of
white
head
bubbles
trickling
slowly
upward
smelled
purely
of
german
malts
and
sweet
bread
hints
of
spiced
apples
spicy
up
front
with
a
sweet
bready
malt
backbone
some
juicy
apple
flavors
in
there
too
dries
the
mouth
slightly
and
then
finishes
bitter
and
just
warms
the
tongue
mediumbodied
and
smooth
tingly
on
the
tongue
and
a
bit
airy
no
doubt
a
tasty
and
refreshing
easy
drink
the
aroma
didnt
promise
much
but
the
flavor
came
through
in
spite
of
that
in
a
classic
underpromiseoverdeliver
maneuver
the
malt
cames
through
grandly
on
the
palate
but
never
goes
too
sweet
and
the
hops
while
more
of
an
eldritch
than
anything
substantial
lend
the
crisp
bittering
air
that
makes
it
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
for
sure
the
abv
is
very
wellcamoflaged
so
care
is
to
be
taken
lest
one
too
many
put
you
on
your
back
and
id
just
as
soon
be
conscious
when
drinking
this
drinkability
is
fairly
hgh
allow
aggressive
interviewng
and
a
late
spring
cold
have
made
me
miserable
mouthfeel
is
about
the
same
would
be
interested
in
trying
this
beer
bottle
conditioned
would
no
doubt
give
a
less
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
improved
head
retention
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
one
has
to
exercise
caution
when
approaching
this
beer
nothing
significantly
unique
but
relatively
true
to
style
method
and
approach
a
good
spring
celebration
beer
finger
licking
good
drinkability
and
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
overly
great
its
incredibly
pilsener
like
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
it
was
crisp
and
clean
thanks
to
victorys
new
brewing
system
i
assume
a
good
spring
beer
clear
golden
pour
with
a
thick
head
that
disappeared
but
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
percolating
through
smell
is
of
candied
fruit
and
malt
the
taste
is
fantastic
malty
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
with
faint
traces
of
toasted
grain
in
the
backgroun
the
hop
character
is
just
barely
there
enough
to
make
its
presence
felt
and
reinforce
the
maltiness
there
is
an
almost
peppery
little
bite
that
comes
through
with
the
alcohol
but
the
creamy
mouthfeel
ties
everything
back
together
really
well
overall
a
fantastic
beer
does
victory
make
any
other
kind
that
i
am
excited
to
have
easy
access
to
this
spring
dn
oh
good
heavens
this
beer
is
just
about
perfect
the
smells
and
the
tastes
are
phenomenal
very
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
beer
to
come
home
to
after
working
the
night
shift
and
wanting
to
relax
with
highly
recommended
im
more
impressed
with
victory
all
the
time
its
probably
my
favorite
brewery
and
i
havent
yet
made
the
trip
to
downingtown
i
need
to
definately
do
that
soon
im
63
tall
and
weigh
close
to
300
and
two
of
these
do
me
in
wow
beer
is
good
happy
beering
sampled
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
bright
clear
gold
with
a
refreshing
floral
nose
that
includes
hints
of
candy
fresh
hops
full
in
the
mouth
as
a
great
mix
of
spicy
hops
pale
malts
fill
your
mouth
full
of
sweet
melons
toffee
earthy
minerals
appealing
floral
hints
slippery
full
mouthfeel
with
a
bright
almost
herbal
hop
finish
damn
fine
lager
a
very
good
maibock
spot
on
to
style
like
all
of
victorys
lagers
light
amber
in
color
the
head
was
on
the
small
side
while
unimpressive
in
the
appearance
it
was
a
surprise
after
that
with
a
crisp
orange
flower
aroma
and
a
refreshing
citrus
flavor
theres
a
light
bitter
finish
that
helps
make
this
an
excellent
maibock
since
being
back
in
se
pa
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
really
a
nicely
done
bock
that
isnt
overpowering
very
nice
looking
beer
with
a
nice
head
even
after
2
hours
in
a
growler
nice
munich
malt
caramel
notes
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
nice
following
the
nose
with
some
just
right
caramel
munich
flavors
i
figure
theyre
munich
flavors
maybe
some
vienna
malts
as
well
i
also
get
some
hops
in
the
finish
i
think
theyre
hops
just
a
bit
bitter
at
the
end
i
like
it
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
nothing
super
very
drinkable
even
at
7abv
pours
a
clear
amber
copper
with
a
peach
colored
fluffy
head
the
lacing
is
sparse
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweets
malt
slighlty
floral
hops
a
breadiness
yeast
and
a
touch
of
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
toasted
malts
very
light
fruit
overtones
and
a
short
quick
finish
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
full
and
rich
a
little
sticky
and
the
warming
hint
of
alcohol
comes
out
near
the
end
on
the
palate
the
balance
and
smooth
character
make
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
a
really
nice
spring
seasonal
overall
i
prefer
hefes
wits
and
pilsners
around
this
time
of
year
been
averaging
80
degrees
plusbut
this
is
a
perfect
choice
to
have
one
tap
when
spring
is
heading
fast
into
summer
delicious
overall
another
nice
brew
from
the
folks
at
victory
a
nice
balance
and
complexity
for
a
helles
bock
imho
nice
looking
beer
amber
colored
with
a
pure
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
layer
mostly
on
the
edges
and
a
little
puddle
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
is
there
is
pleasant
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
very
tasty
chunky
but
balanced
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
complex
so
it
keep
you
interested
and
entertained
anytime
i
see
a
victory
product
on
tap
i
have
to
try
it
they
just
are
always
a
wonderful
balanced
representation
of
their
style
this
maibock
definitely
delivers
for
me
pours
amber
mild
brown
with
an
off
white
peach
colored
head
a
nice
trickled
lace
forms
as
the
head
begins
to
dwindle
aroma
is
full
of
malt
balanced
by
slighlty
floral
hops
a
breadiness
possibly
from
the
yeast
and
a
touch
of
plum
notes
comes
through
to
form
one
amazing
beer
aroma
taste
is
very
nice
mellow
balanced
flavor
primarily
consists
of
malt
sweet
tones
with
an
underlying
fruit
tone
and
hop
profile
tip
toeing
on
my
palate
followed
by
a
warming
rush
of
aclohol
that
is
not
too
overbearing
just
need
to
give
this
beer
a
little
kick
mouthfeel
is
slightly
stickywith
a
tickling
carbonation
from
this
wellconsructed
medium
bodied
victory
classic

nice

seasonal
that
i
was
pleased
to
find
on
tap
very
nice
beer
that
plan
to
visit
revisit
hopefully
in
downington
i
have
tried
to
brew
this
and
related
styles
and
they
are
picky
this
one
definitely
deserves
a
second
looksee
when
i
find
it
again
549
draught
victory
this
one
pours
a
absolutely
clear
golden
color
there
was
very
little
white
head
on
it
the
nose
was
somewhat
malty
and
also
had
a
slight
grassiness
to
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
malty
biscuity
taste
and
was
slightly
sweet
the
medium
body
belies
its
7

alcohol
very
good
fruity
sweet
nose
yeasty
rose
color
with
a
yellow
tint
sweet
taste
with
some
floral
notes
in
the
finish
hop
sweet
biscut
malt
taste
in
dominant
medium
mouth
with
lively
little
bubble
action
on
the
tongue
solid
and
quite
drinkable
had
this
at
the
45
ba
event
and
thanks
to
the
bas
at
lunch
for
the
reccomendation
it
went
well
with
the
pizza
prost
this
beer
came
to
me
a
crystal
clear
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
to
dark
straw
colored
the
head
was
white
in
color
and
seemed
dense
and
light
in
nature
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
fairly
simple
sweet
malt
flowers
very
light
fruit
and
some
bitter
hops
the
flavors
of
the
saint
were
less
simple
then
the
nose
some
hops
took
the
front
bitter
and
floral
hops
light
caramel
great
malt
some
very
light
fruit
and
a
tad
alcohol
seemed
to
be
present
as
well
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
that
seemed
to
keep
each
other
in
balance
with
the
malt
slightly
more
aggressive
which
left
it
with
a
moderate
sweet
appeal
to
it
medium
bodied
and
good
malt
balance
make
this
beer
pleasant
to
drink
very
good
maibock
that
changes
form
year
to
year
with
varying
malts
and
hops
sometimes
dry
other
times
sweeter
7
4
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
and
is
a
fairly
smooth
maibock
the
draft
version
is
usually
all
that
is
available
anymore
some
years
they
bottle
it
and
some
they
will
bottle
something
different
a
must
try
for
maltheads
as
the
malt
usually
dominates
if
slightly
over
the
hops
be
forewarned
its
hard
to
find
the
brewery
in
an
industrial
complex
and
you
cannot
see
at
all
it
if
coming
in
from
the
west
overall
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
capital
well
balanced
highly
drinkable
fantastic
offering
fresh
bread
on
the
nose
pours
brilliant
copper
tinted
gold
under
a
dense
white
head
rich
malt
and
well
developed
melanoidins
give
it
full
flavors
full
body
and
medium
carbonation
final
score
2
40
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
sweet
leaning
malty
but
with
balance
toasty
mildly
warming
and
easily
drinkable
a
great
spring
offering
so
many
capital
bocks
and
im
not
complaining
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
light
toffeee
light
sweet
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
kiss
of
buttercream
and
a
light
layer
of
sweetgrass
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
damn
fine
maibock
one
that
may
make
one
look
forward
to
the
late
spring
early
summer
months
its
the
end
of
may
and
i
may
be
finishing
the
last
of
this
years
production
but
this
particular
bottle
of
capitals
maibock
still
satisfies
the
malt
and
the
lingering
hops
and
yeastiness
still
make
for
a
worthy
treat
maybe
ill
catch
one
of
these
earlier
next
year
excuse
me
while
i
finish
er
off
this
really
is
a
nice
malty
spring
beer
with
a
small
alcohol
kick
to
it
perfect
after
coming
out
of
this
last
winter
a
slight
grainy
smell
not
overly
impressive
creamy
and
carbonated
and
a
sweet
finish
i
do
just
also
get
a
hint
of
the
hops
on
this
one
allinall
a
recommended
spring
seasonal
beer
o
a
solid
maibock
that
would
pair
well
with
food
i
eagerly
await
the
coming
of
maibock
season
just
for
this
one
and
lakefronts
big
easy
overall
the
lightness
and
breadiness
with
complementing
hops
and
perfect
carbonation
make
this
my
favorite
maibock
o
definitely
above
average
but
nothing
mindblowing
some
bitterness
would
make
this
amazing
overall
a
great
beer
very
clean
taste
and
easy
to
drink
overall
probably
my
favorite
maibock
i
look
forward
to
it
in
the
spring
like
the
spring
wind
blowing
through
young
budding
aspen
trees
this
maibock
makes
me
want
to
bring
back
maydances
and
maypoles
this
was
a
good
beer
above
average
but
it
didnt
completely
change
my
perceptions
either
with
a
lack
of
available
maibocks
this
is
a
satisfying
spring
beer
and
one
ill
go
back
to
note
regarding
hops
i
think
the
need
for
hop
presence
of
maibocks
might
be
overinterpretted
by
many
reviewers
these
beers
should
not
have
a
resounding
hop
presence
they
may
be
slightly
more
bitter
than
other
lagers
but
they
are
also
slightly
more
sweet
than
them
balance
is
key
and
aroma
hops
to
the
degree
found
in
american
ale
styles
seems
out
of
place
i
dont
care
what
rogue
and
the
ba
powers
that
be
say
but
dead
guy
is
not
a
maibock
d
nice
i
do
appreciate
the
refreshing
lightness
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
maibock
is
about
the
best
thing
capital
is
offering
outside
of
their
limited
edition
and
expensive
blonde
dopplebock
and
autumnal
fire
brews
i
would
rate
it
superior
to
sierra
nevadas
glissade
a
similar
seasonal
beer
it
is
a
nice
orangish
color
when
you
pour
it
quite
interesting
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
some
carbonation
tastes
somewhat
bitter
alcohol
is
well
hidden
goes
down
smooth
i
bought
a
six
pack
recently
and
have
had
one
a
few
different
times
with
dinner
with
it
being
a
seasonal
i
may
buy
one
more
six
pack
before
spring
winds
down
or
i
will
just
move
onto
the
summer
beers
that
capital
is
soon
to
come
out
with
overall
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
capital
has
made
a
nice
little
seasonal
in
an
underused
style
will
add
more
thoughts
with
next
sampling
not
a
bad
beer
medium
to
light
body
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
would
say
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
was
6
2
alcohol
as
it
is
pretty
light
and
smooth
very
drinkable
beer
very
good
spring
seasonal
this
is
worth
seeking
out
get
some
taste
not
a
bad
spring
beer
had
enough
punch
to
it
without
getting
away
from
style
more
caramel
in
the
taste
than
most
but
didnt
get
too
heavy
a
little
less
dry
though
than
hoped
for
couldnt
figure
where
all
the
apple
and
carbonation
was
still
coming
from
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
honey
as
well
seemed
more
complex
than
most
but
not
necessarily
better
or
worse
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
some
clinging
lacing
smell
is
malts
toast
a
little
toffee
and
hops
taste
follows
the
same
lots
of
very
good
toasty
and
caramel
malts
then
some
noble
hops
some
earthy
taste
and
some
spices
its
a
medium
mouth
feel
and
easy
to
drink
try
this
one
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
enjoyed
this
less
the
minute
i
tasted
their
blonde
doppelbock
but
this
is
certainly
the
finer
of
the
two
any
puzzling
similarities
aside
this
is
going
to
be
my
best
rating
in
some
time
a
very
drinkable
beer
however
i
could
tell
it
was
a
higher
abv
beer
but
it
wasnt
boozy
overall
another
quality
lager
from
the
brewery
in
a
sea
of
american
ales
nice
to
have
this
to
go
to
every
spring
to
break
from
the
stouts
and
porters
of
winter
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
a
chance
d
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
maibock
that
i
could
see
myself
having
quite
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
while
i
would
like
to
see
something
fuller
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
affordable
for
the
quality
most
capital
beers
that
i
would
consider
buying
in
six
packs
are
extremely
expensive
so
its
nice
to
see
a
solid
offering
from
them
without
having
to
fork
over
a
ton
great
example
of
the
style
not
overpowering
but
a
great
combination
of
delicate
flavours
short
offwhite
head
with
no
lace
deep
golden
color
is
not
quite
transparent
i
keep
getting
a
whiff
of
something
like
banana
but
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
aroma
but
thats
about
it
fairly
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
kind
of
earthy
sharp
butterscotch
flavor
body
is
full
but
not
overbearing
the
alcohol
and
dry
finish
make
for
a
beer
that
works
in
the
end
its
a
bit
subdued
but
the
flavor
is
solid
and
this
is
a
well
put
together
beer
not
impressed
with
this
one
pours
a
nice
goldencopper
color
with
a
nice
dense
white
head
it
kind
of
sticks
around
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
this
is
really
a
nice
looking
beer
clear
golden
im
interested
the
smell
is
nice
too
it
comes
out
with
some
very
nice
pilsener
malt
graininess
very
nice
graininess
and
it
has
that
brilliant
lager
cleanness
theres
a
bit
of
a
caramelly
cakey
sticky
malt
but
not
too
much
sweetness
i
can
also
catch
a
whiff
of
some
earthy
hops
spicy
herbal
but
not
fruity
and
floral
smells
nice
the
taste
is
good
too
crisp
and
malty
this
is
what
i
want
noy
as
dark
and
rich
as
a
doppelbock
but
quite
a
bit
more
malty
than
any
other
lager
this
is
still
quite
refreshing
theres
a
nice
tone
of
caramellized
sugar
with
a
distinct
barley
graininess
with
just
a
finish
of
some
earthy
leaves
nice
and
sticky
as
it
goes
down
with
great
big
body
and
there
are
no
offfermentation
flavors
theres
a
crisp
bite
of
carbonation
good
im
going
to
give
this
a
good
rating
for
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
goes
down
well
and
i
would
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
though
at
6
2
wouldnt
turn
it
into
a
session
lager
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
with
my
meal
and
feel
i
could
drink
it
as
a
standalone
beer
just
about
any
time
of
the
year
it
isnt
too
heavy
isnt
too
strong
for
a
maibock
and
has
a
wonderful
blend
of
flavor
drinkability
is
good
as
well
if
i
had
to
drink
a
lager
this
one
would
be
tops
of
the
list
i
havent
had
too
many
maibocks
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
had
everything
ive
had
from
capital
is
solid
and
this
is
no
exception
tastes
of
zippy
bock
malt
heavy
floral
esters
with
a
complicated
candy
middle
of
toffee
and
caramel
ends
with
very
light
european
hops
and
more
bitter
alcohol
d
nice
and
light
with
a
dry
crispness
to
the
finish
an
easy
drinking
spring
beer
thats
of
good
quality
nothing
amazing
but
good
a
solid
maibock
from
capital
so
far
ive
been
impressed
with
their
german
styles
drinkability
great
tasting
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
its
not
very
expensive
incredibly
drinkable
and
despite
not
knowing
the
style
very
well
i
am
definitely
interested
in
trying
many
more
maibocks
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
again
and
likely
will
d
oh
quite
drinkable
indeed
smooth
i
really
was
impressed
by
this
beer
an
excellent
domestic
maibock
from
capital
a
nice
maibock
a
golden
color
and
the
head
was
a
bit
short
lived
very
clear
beer
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
kind
of
the
same
kind
of
a
musty
kind
of
smell
and
taste
which
is
fitting
to
a
miabock
also
very
nice
sweet
aftertaste
i
think
that
the
mouthfeel
is
great
in
this
beer
i
wish
that
the
head
would
have
stayed
around
awhile
longer
but
the
mouthfeel
was
indeed
smooth
but
with
all
the
maibocks
coming
out
it
is
definitely
spring
in
wisconsin
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
drinkability
nice
beer
for
the
long
transition
between
winter
and
spring
in
wisconsin
not
so
rich
as
some
high
malt
beers
but
enough
alcohol
to
keep
you
warm
drinkability
a
very
nice
maibock
indeed
with
full
flavor
and
welldisguised
alcohol
this
is
a
very
good
maibock
and
i
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
a
capital
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
quickly
fading
white
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
noble
hops
has
a
good
flavor
of
malt
with
pepper
and
grassy
notes
just
enough
hops
flavors
to
keep
me
interested
some
cloying
sweetness
on
the
finish
is
the
only
fault
i
can
find
in
this
maibock
bitterness
is
low
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
harsh
on
the
tongue
at
6
2
abv
the
drinkability
is
hurt
a
bit
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
one
hell
of
a
maibock
highly
recomended
an
easy
drinking
maibock
from
the
folks
at
capital
crystal
clear
golden
honey
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
head
smells
like
a
roasted
barley
malt
blended
with
honey
and
a
dash
of
lemon
and
hops
to
round
out
an
enticing
nose
first
taste
is
a
mellow
rounded
malt
with
some
belgianesque
yeast
and
honey
comes
to
a
fairly
quick
finish
where
the
late
hops
and
citrus
bittering
linger
to
round
out
the
experience
light
and
balanced
the
whole
way
through
but
far
from
the
wateryness
you
find
in
some
of
the
more
delicate
brews
gone
wrong
overall
a
wonderful
bock
that
makes
me
wish
i
had
purchased
more
d
big
this
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
laidback
beer
drinking
session
lower
abv
clean
great
balance
even
with
the
malty
start
the
hops
and
resin
kick
in
for
a
balanced
finish
well
done
and
a
solid
maibock
put
this
on
your
springsummer
drinking
list
it
will
be
on
mine
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
has
all
of
the
right
characteristics
for
the
maibock
style
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
more
subdued
than
appearances
led
me
to
believe
not
a
bad
beer
overall
and
i
feel
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
although
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hop
presence
particularly
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
great
nice
balance
of
silky
creamy
and
carbonated
characteristics
notes
from
041007
d
very
good
beer
here
this
stuff
is
sweet
but
never
too
sweet
and
its
much
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
easily
the
best
beer
that
ive
tried
from
capital
brewery
and
its
second
only
to
the
outstanding
dead
guy
in
its
style
category
im
disappointed
in
this
brew
while
well
made
its
not
particularly
inspired
drinkable
enough
but
with
its
big
body
and
pronounced
sweetness
as
well
as
alcohol
content
this
would
not
be
session
fare
a
good
enough
beer
just
not
particlarly
exciting
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
hopefully
it
does
more
for
you
than
it
did
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
a
winner
quite
drinkable
not
the
best
maibock
ive
ever
had
but
is
still
worth
mentioning
it
is
slightly
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
beer
pours
a
bronzegold
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
noble
hops
and
a
hint
of
butter
the
taste
is
clean
and
very
malty
lots
of
bread
hints
of
toffee
and
mild
noble
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
seems
a
little
low
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
miabock
i
could
drink
it
again
but
there
are
a
lot
of
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
capital
maiback
poured
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
an
orange
tinted
head
that
almost
reminded
me
of
orange
soda
smell
was
a
little
faint
but
fruity
and
citrus
taste
was
crisp
with
biscuits
and
caramel
with
hints
of
citrus
in
the
back
mouthfeel
was
good
as
well
as
the
drinkability
not
to
much
experience
with
this
style
but
i
will
say
that
i
liked
this
beer
another
nice
offering
from
capital
i
like
this
maibock
better
than
others
thats
fine
and
well
except
that
i
hate
maibocks
they
are
too
sticky
sweet
and
too
much
caramel
in
the
taste
with
a
poor
hop
balance
opinion
alert
not
a
decree
the
fact
that
i
like
this
one
may
speak
for
an
undesireable
quality
pertaining
to
the
style
of
this
brew
either
way
capital
is
a
fine
brewery
with
a
distinct
house
flavor
i
think
this
is
the
best
maibock
ive
had
outside
of
germany
my
pour
produced
nothing
more
than
some
white
wisps
that
quickly
dissipated
to
nothingness
the
color
was
a
deep
orangish
gold
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
a
malty
sweetness
that
was
in
keeping
with
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
almost
creamy
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
even
a
little
heat
on
the
tongue
the
finish
continued
to
have
a
lingering
sweetness
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
not
as
drinkable
as
some
of
capitals
other
beers
overall
a
very
solid
maibock
nothing
flashy
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
just
an
allaround
good
beer
feels
really
flat
but
medium
bodied
and
juicy
still
its
refreshing
but
not
filling
in
any
way
itd
make
a
good
session
beer
but
i
wont
have
any
more
this
is
not
a
bad
offering
and
if
you
see
it
available
give
it
a
try
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
it
isnt
worth
spending
time
seeking
out
though
poured
from
a
cold
bottle
into
my
favorite
beer

clear
dark
amber
with
very
little

maybe
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
raisins
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
medium
carbonation
mediumheavy
body
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
special
here
not
the
best
example
of
capital
brewery
d
pretty
good
blonde
is
better
and
they
are
released
together
however
so
ill
prolly
go
with
that

looking
for
a
good

a
delicious

that
hits
the

good

and
bubbles
despite
the
inauspicious
beginning
i
find
this
to
be
a
worthy
competitor
with
any
of
its
transatlantic
cohorts
a
solid
offering
for
bock
lovers
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
stingy
amount
of
head
nice
to
see
some
real
head
retention
on
a
lager
th
aroma
is
a
light
piney
hop
with
some
sugary
malts
the
firssip
is
a
dry
sweet
malt
reminding
me
of
sweet
bread
and
other
malted
grains
like
wheat
are
noticed
in
the
back
of
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
acidic
yet
dry
pretty
good
maibock
brewed
in
america
like
this
beer
i
think
for
the
price
i
will
pick
up
some
bottles
of
this
seasonal
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
pound
down
several
of
throughout
the
course
of
an
evening
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
them
if
the
beer
were
available
in
this
area
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
excellent
maibock
not
too
strong
or
rich
but
with
enough
boldness
and
character
to
make
a
statement
another
exquisite
brew
from
capital
cheers
d
a
tasty
maibock
capital
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
world
ive
had
only
56
of
their
brews
but
all
have
been
class
acts
luckily
i
have
5
more
to
tryretaste
tonight
thanks
again
randy
for
allowing
me
to
be
your
first
idaho
order
pretty
good
would
make
a
nice
summer
beer
if
that
artificial
flavor
note
went
away
unfortunately
as
it
stands
it
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
poured
amber
with
a
smooth
medium
head
no
lacing
the
smell
is
just
lager
yeast
i
really
get
nothing
else
out
of
it
the
beer
is
somewhat
sweet
and
tangy
up
front
softer
in
the
back
nothing
special
but
pleasant
enough
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
creamy
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
there
are
better
maibocks
out
there
but
this
is
pleasant
enough
and
relatively
cheap
to
boot
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
off
white
head
a
that
fades
fairly
quickly
some
lacing
observed
the
smell
is
a
sweet
pineapple
cherry
and
vanilla
malt
light
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
yet
singular
the
flavor
mirrors
the
smell
but
without
a
lot
of
body
it
kinda
sits
out
there
its
an
unceremonious
version
of
a
celebration
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
stays
quite
well
a
bit
of
stickiness
spotty
here
and
there
smell
is
a
very
light
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
light
citrus
fruit
odors
taste
is
very
much
of
the
same
light
sweet
caramel
notes
with
a
nice
mild
hop
bite
towards
the
end
aftertaste
is
a
sweet
biscuity
malt
flavor
very
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
perfect
for
this
style
capital
seems
to
master
the
bock
styles
for
sure
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
capital
brewery
this
is
a
very
full
refreshing
beer
i
can
see
drinking
several
of
these
would
be
very
nice
with
something
off
the
grill
in
the
summer
say
grilled
sausage
and
peppers
it
poured
a
light
dull
brown
in
a
pub
glass
with
large
dirty
looking
bubbles
smell
was
lightly
malty
flavor
was
a
bit
of
caramel
but
generally
very
mild
and
bland
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
i
cant
say
i
feel
moved
to
strongly
recommend
this
beer
a
spring
release
ive
grown
to
look
forward
to
the
maibock
is
a
great
sessionable
bock
the
color
is
a
reddish
amber
and
offers
a
lightly
creamy
head
with
good
lacing
smell
is
good
with
no
discerning
characteristics
of
offense
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
but
hinting
a
bit
at
higher
alcohol
a
decent
brew
but
id
prefer
a
traditional
bavarian
bock
style
taste
is
nicely
balanced
yeast
adds
a
slight
sweet
fruitiness
and
smooths
the
mouthfeel
lightly
malty
very
refreshing
simplicity
and
tradition
go
a
long
way
with
this
one
seems
very
well
balanced
overall
a
great
springtime
session

for

from

grocery
tigard
or
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
mediocre
nose
and
pretty
copper
color
which
leaves
light
lacing
around
the
glass
the
taste
is
all
malt
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
very
lagery
crisp
clean

pretty
drinkable
there
is

brewfest
2005
alright
another
blond
bland
maibock
not
geez
im
getting
tired
of
these
things
they
have
no
depth
or
character
just
sugary
sweet
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
this
one
is
especially
bland
with
a
light
finish
of
honey
maybe
it
was
the
overwhelming
presence
of
these
beers
as
the
brewfest
and
this
one
was
later
on
but
this
one
is
just
not
interesting
at
all
into
a
point
pours
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
decent
head
shrinking
to
nothing
and
little
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
a
sweet
bready
malt
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
nuts
taste
is
pretty
good
nice
sweet
malts
like
caramel
and
a
tingly
mouth
of
flowery
hops
with
nuts
staying
tingly
though
the
end
with
a
twinge
of
hop
bitterness
but
mostly
syrupy
sweet
mouth
is
pretty
smooth
but
well
carbonated
and
overall
its
a
pretty
darn
good
drink
basically
one
that
id
like
to
see
in
another
mixer
6er
capital
maibock
is
a
good
version
that
could
use
at
least
one
more
facet
to
what
is
a
fairly
onedimensional
flavor
profile
maibock
lovers
will
probably
love
it
the
rest
of
us
need
something
more
something
special
to
keep
us
coming
back
spring
after
spring
pours
a
bright
goldenorange
with
a
skim
of
white
bubbles
hard
to
get
a
good
pour
at
a
place
like
this
nose
a
balanced
mix
of
light
floral
hops
and
brown
sugarbiscuity
malt
tastes
like
blond
dopplebock
light
smooth
grassy
hops
and
sugary
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
their
blonde
but
still
substantial
in
the
mouth
a
solid
bock
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
any
of
their
other
seasonal
dopples
the
clerk
that
i
bought
this
from
said
it
tasted
like
nb
fat
tire
i
have
to
disagree
i
thought
it
was
a
lot
better
d
this
beer
has
nice
crisp
clean
toasted
malt
flavors
that
are
not
complex
but
very
fresh
my
god
is
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
i
could
kill
a
keg
myself
yikes
i
have
been
a
fan
of
capital
for
some
time
but
finding
fresh
products
in
council
bluffs
ia
was
tricky
not
any
more
even
at
10
a
sixpack
i
cant
say
no
to
this
lovely
beer
wow
highly
recommended
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
that
seems
to
taste
better
as
it
ages
towards
the
end
of
the
cycle
of
its
release
each
year
recommend
buying
it
early
but
saving
it
in
the
fridge
for
a
month
or
two
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
solid
ivory
head
a
constant
cascade
of
bubbles
is
present
and
the
beer
is
as
clear
as
could
be
very
nice
loking
brew
nose
provides
notes
of
toasted
bread
and
light
grainyness
a
very
faint
floral
hop
is
there
but
not
obtrusive
at
all
i
enjoy
the
big
toastyness
in
this
one
flavor
really
echos
that
toastyness
grainy
notes
are
light
to
moderate
breaking
up
the
toastyness
a
bit
i
really
enjoy
the
aftertaste
it
really
carries
the
toasted
notes
and
draws
me
back
to
this
one
again
i
think
this
one
is
a
solid
maibock
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
of
tiny
bubbles
it
makes
the
brew
feel
a
little
more
thick
than
it
really
is
and
i
like
that
with
the
toastybready
malt
character
this
one
is
nice
it
has
just
enough
hop
to
carry
it
through
while
letting
the
toasty
and
bready
malt
bill
carry
the
weight
of
the
flavor
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
i
look
forward
to
more
time
in
wisconsin
to
have
more
of
the
beers
from
these
guys
yet
another
solid
entry
by
capital
prost
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
munich
and
carapils
malts
its
dry
with
some
breadlike
notes
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
slightly
musty
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
semi
sweet
and
a
bit
breadlike
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
drinking
maibock
it
has
good
malt
content
but
it
just
doesnt
blow
my
hair
back
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
think
i
could
probably
drink
a
dozen
of
these
no
problem
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
which
must
be
relatively
high
though
it
doesnt
have
a
strong
or
distinctive
flavor
its
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
cant
seem
to
resist
malty
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
bready
honey
sweetness
with
a
clean
fresh
finish
light
carbonation
and
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
needs
a
little
more
hop
balance
but
its
a
very
good
beer
pours
goldenamber
with
a
poor
white
head
the
smell
is
sugary
and
grainy
the
taste
is
light
sugary
fruity
malts
with
a
tiny
hint
of
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
as
a
bready
or
yeasty
taste
that
is
faint
and
hard
to
describe
mouthfeel
is
average
medium
and
slightly
sticky
there
is
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
but
i
enjoy
it
a
whole
lot
its
easy
drinkin
clean
and
basic
but
with
a
little
something
extra
in
the
flavor
and
in
the
abv
i
wish
i
knew
the
abv
id
guess
around
6
5

drinkability
is
very
high
just
ask
davo

was
able
to
chug
and
entire
pint
before
running
away

along
with
spicy
hops
grainy
flavor
with
toasted

in
the

this
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
but
it
very
clean
with
no
noticable
off
flavor
there
is
some
noticable
alcohol
flavor
carbonation
is
slightly
higher
than
average
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
capital
and
its
very
good
on

too

holds
throughout
drinking
mild
nutty
malty
nose
nothing
extraordinary
here
flavor
was
good
roasted
malts
and
a
mildly
hoppy
finish
clean
on
the
pallet
not
too
heavy
easy
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
this
is
a
nice
spring
brew
a
compromise
between
the
heavy
strength
of
winter
and
the
delicate
craft
of
summer
this
is
solid
honest
beer
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
mai
bocknope
we
call
this
one
mind
block
this
beer
sure
doesnt
seem
very
strong
but
a
few
pints
usually
leaves
my
friends
and
i
in
a
rather
bizarre
loopy
state
unakin
to
normal
inebriation
drinking
capitals
mai
bock
for
whatever
reason
seems
to
knock
me
on
my
rear
like
few
beers
do
the
predominant
characteristic
of
this
hazy
orange
brew
is
its
immense
sickly
sweet
fruit
forward
slightly
alcoholic
nose
and
taste
the
strong
yeast
presence
in
the
beer
is
typically
capital
and
very
german
finish
is
fresh
baked
baguette
and
spice
drinkability
is
ridiculous
and
even
though
i
dont
really
care
for
the
taste
nor
style
i
keep
coming
back
for
more
so
something
must
be
right
here
now
this
is
what
a
maibock
ought
be
light
and
refreshing
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
but
there
is
much
more
to
this
beer
than
that
the
nose
is
like
fresh
fruit
fallen
from
the
tree
a
magical
melange
of
fruity
yeastesters
and
earthy
noble
hops
mmmm
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
exatically
what
youd
expect
from
the
nose
with
a
round
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
carbonation
tickling
your
tongue
good
beer
good
times
drinkability
enjoyable
and
drinkable
another
solid
one
from
just
to
the
west
of
here
off
university
ave
a
good
first
impression
from
capital
looking
forward
to
trying
some
others
reviewing
this
simultaneously
with
tyranena
fighting
finches
mai
bock
sprecher
mai
bock
and
rogue
dead
guy
ale
looks
just
like
the
sprecher
a
faintly
redtinted
amber
color
pretty
much
an
average
of
the
other
three
this
beer
smells
faintly
of
apples
and
tastes
pretty
balanced
with
a
slight
tilt
toward
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
whipped
cream
upholds
the
capital
brewery
legacy
of
faithful
solid
and
thoroughly
unexceptional
beers
flavor
is
where
this
one
gets
interesting
rich
mouthfell
surrounds
toasty
malts
with
a
nice
sweetness
an
easy
hop
ending
that
compliments
the
rest
of
the
flavor
honey
and
pearapple
fruits
quite
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
capital
brewery
offerings
ive
had
beautiful
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
crystal
clear
malty
aroma
with
spicey
yeast
the
malt
aroma
is
bready
not
quite
carmelly
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
sweet
almost
carmel
slight
peppery
yeast
and
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
good
malt
body
and
balancing
bitterness
this
is
a
fabulous
example
of
the
style
d
the
low
carbonation
makes
the
sips
slide
down
smoothly
and
that
fact
combined
with
the
delicious
taste
makes
this
one
a
very
easy
drinker
color
is
spoton
for
a
maibock
a
light
brown
crystal
clear
color
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
smell
is
big
and
malty
but
not
overpowering
this
may
be
served
too
cold
theres
a
blizzard
outside
of
course
its
too
cold
taste
is
at
first
sweet
maltiness
slightly
grassy
not
overdone
or
cloying
just
delicious
hops
are
no
where
on
my
radar
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
a
little
too
thin
good
but
there
are
better
maibocks
out
there
having
pulled
this
single
bottle
from
the
1
bin
in
kansas
city
it
held
up
well
as
a
summer
treat
my
hat
is
off
to
the
folks
in
middleton
who
have
been
doing
a
great
job
for
years
sampled
3604
drinkability
a
steady
wellmade
brew
from
the
good
folks
at
capital
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
a
late
spring
evening
after
cutting
the
grass
again
cheers
to
zap
and
whoever
else
had
a
hand
in
getting
this
fine
wisconsin
maibock
into
my
glass
a
spring
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
maibock
i
like
the
thick
malt
prescence
but
wish
capital
threw
in
some
more
hops
pretty
straightforward
its
hard
to
knock
this
beers
drinkability
even
a
bit
the
hops
arent
really
sturdy
enough
to
keep
this
thing
together
the
whole
way
through
but
it
redeems
itself
in
the
end
with
a
nice
smattering
of
hop
bitterness
not
a
terribly
remarkable
beer
but
sometimes
thats
a
good
thing
this
is
my
first
maibock
and
from
this
beer
i
am
really
excited
about
the
style
the
alcohol
while
unlisted
is
there
i
would
guess
about
7
or
so
these
guys
have
shown
they
can
do
very
good
beers
that
stick
to
style
and
their
uniform
label
design
suggests
they
want
to
get
placed
in
the
store
with
the
mega
beers
hope
they
decide
to
go
wild
and
do
something
special
nasty
little
linger
here
that
does
not
want
to
let
go
which
brings
the
s
down
syrupy
impressions
boy
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
in
this
one
a
white
fizzy
head
sits
atop
a
clear
clean
apricot
colored
beer
some
maltiness
on
the
nose
strong
malt
backbone
dominates
this
beer
with
a
very
slight
spicy
hop
finish
i
like
the
flavor
profile
of
this
one
very
heavy
malt
with
notes
of
vanilla
maybe
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
an
excellent
maibock
id
stack
up
there
with
the
top
dozen
or
so
ive
tried
pours
a
cloudy
orangy
yellow
good
frothy
head
that
disapates
to
lacy
coating
taste
is
toasty
to
say
the
least
malt
and
barley
a
little
hops
to
balance
velvetty
mouthfeel
seems
to
have
a
pretty
good
alchohol
kick
overall
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
day
its
brilliant
orangeamber
body
and
frothy
white
head
make
for
a
beautiful
appearance
the
head
retention
is
excellent
and
it
delivers
some
very
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
rich
malt
leaps
out
at
you
in
the
aroma
clean
and
fresh
its
full
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
luscious
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
delivers
rich
soft
malt
thats
very
mildly
toasty
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
a
mild
note
of
spicy
alcohol
an
underlying
bitterness
balances
extremely
well
keeping
the
softly
sweet
malt
from
building
on
the
palate
very
nice
and
although
its
alcohol
content
will
keep
you
from
drinking
more
than
just
a
few
youll
probably
want
to
this
is
a
perfectly
clear
copper
color
not
much
of
a
head
though
a
slight
and
bubbly
collar
is
apparant
and
lacing
is
adequate
deep
malty
tones
on
the
nose
very
nice
this
just
smells
bavarian
the
body
of
this
beer
is
damn
near
full
feels
great
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
is
just
right
the
taste
is
big
and
malty
i
love
it
bready
doughy
a
meal
in
a
bottle
thick
munich
malts
lay
down
a
fabulous
foundation
hops
dont
impart
much
in
the
bitterness
or
flavor
just
there
for
balancing
im
sure
love
this
one
a
little
different
than
other
maibocks
ive
had
but
a
very
enjoyable
change
from
my
ordinary
porter
stout
brown
samplings
the
beers
ive
tried
from
capital
are
each
part
of
the
tasting
tour
package
of
eight
12
ounce
bottled
beers
produced
quarterly
i
have
found
their
beers
to
be
consistently
above
average
very
drinkable
and
lacking
qualities
of
greatness
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
a
line
of
beers
that
can
achieve
these
attributes
and
be
affordable
to
most
beer
drinkers
well
done
capital
well
done
nice
orangy
glow
with
a
huge
creamy
white
head
two
fingers
high
and
settled
slowly
to
retain
a
solid
haze
of
bubbles
and
some
large
curtains
of
lace
and
some
spots
smell
is
soft
of
yeast
breadlike
dough
with
hop
notes
lingering
in
the
back
and
sweet
malt
notes
as
well
taste
is
smooth
and
mild
with
a
small
sweet
tang
and
easy
bitterness
quite
nice
the
malt
really
comes
through
as
it
warms
which
is
a
nice
feature
feel
is
a
solid
mediumlight
body
with
a
lightly
measurable
creamyness
an
oily
sense
as
well
and
has
a
slight
zestyness
in
the
finishing
hold
one
dynamite
beer
drinkable
stuff
for
sure
id
have
another
in
a
pinch
i
found
this
more
enjoyable
than
most
others
that
have
reviewed
this
but
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
aroma
is
a
little
light
mostly
of
malt
and
rather
sweet
almost
a
corn
like
quality
although
im
not
accussing
the
brewer
of
anything
brilliant
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
settles
rather
quickly
really
nice
flavor
of
pleasing
malt
alcohol
notes
and
a
very
clean
presence
slight
bitterness
twoards
the
finish
leaving
a
long
but
not
necessarily
dry
finish
soft
and
fluffy
with
a
medium
body
and
adequate
carbonation
could
be
a
session
beer
but
with
that
much
alcohol
it
would
be
a
short
session
i
like
this
a
brilliant
orangeamber
body
with
a
very
minimal
and
soft
white
head
escapes
from
the
bottle
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
malty
nose
without
being
cloying
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
hops
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
mellow
maltiness
characteristic
of
the
style
with
a
fading
hop
bit
way
in
the
background
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
great
harbinger
of
spring

beer
hoppier
than

in

i
have
had
probably
not
something
i
would
go
to
all
the
time
but
could
see
it
being
nice
on
a
hot
day
or
paired
with
a
salad
actually
not
among
my
favorite
maibocks
but
still
good
poured
a
deep
dark
amber
very
clear
with
lots
of
streaming
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the

no

slight
amount
of

smell
was
very
bready
and
grain
like
with
a
hint
of
a
slight
bitterness
but
definatly
bread
like
the
flavor
followed
suit
as
it
was
highly
malted
and
full
of
grain
like
flavors
not
much
hops
to
balance
but
ever
so
slightly
dry
finish
kinda
thin
in
feel
not
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
that
silky

this
was
a
decent
offering
from

an

i
could

this
was

it

this

malts
that
i
didnt
pick
up
in
the
nose
finish
is
where
you
get
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
im
picking
up
grapefruit
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
body
beer
decent
carbonation
starts
off
crisp
but
has
a
sticky
finish
to
it
touch
of
alcohol
warms
you
this
is
a
nice
beer
lower
abv
would
make
it
more
drinkable
but
it
is
a
nice
one
to
sit
with
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
very
filling
nice
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
that
is
wellworth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
d
with
the
taste
and
feel
i
knew
this
was
over
5
but
im
impressed
that
stoudts
got
all
this
flavor
with
only
7
abv
to
show
for
it
i
would
not
mind
to
drink
three
in
an
evening
its
just
that
enticing
come
spring
time
around
may
this
seems
like
a
no
brainer
and
i
will
grab
a
6er
or
more
of
fresh
bottles
overall
this
is
absolutely
one
of
the
best
maibocks
i
have
ever
had
and
proves
why
stoudts
makes
some
of
the
best
lagers
in
the
us
i
received
this
beer
in
a
trade
from
mikereaser
this
is
the
first
blonde
double
mai
bock
that
i
have
ever
tried
so
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
i
pulled
this
beer
out
of
my
fridge
opened
it
and
it
foamed
up
all
over
my
counter
fun
fun
fun
this
beer
poors
a
nice
golden
blonde
color
and
it
has
an
interesting
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
too
overpoweringly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
the
7
alcohol
is
well
hidden
if
this
beer
was
available
in
arkansas
i
would
drink
it
quite
a
bit
a
nice
example
of
a
style
which
i
dont
see
too
often
this
is
actually
last
years
bottling
now
that
stoudts
has
come
to
nc
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
in
the
spring
on
a
side
note
this
is
my
first
beer
review
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
am
kicking
myself
for
only
picking
up
one
of
drinkability
its
a
bit
too
cloying
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
sam
adams
boston
lager
or
rogue
dead
guy
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
maibock
well
worth
the
cost
ill
be
buying
it
again
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
knew
it
was
a
little
out
of
date
but
the
7
abv
would
make
it
last
a
little
longer
tastes
like
a
strong
kolsch
if
i
had
to
describe
it
a
dark
yellow
in
color
with
a
bite
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
after
finish
but
not
much
at
all
very
interesting
listed
under
the
same
style
as
dead
guy
from
rogue
which
i
thought
tasted
better
but
this
is
a
much
better
deal
and
for
the
price
it
was
exceptional
d
excellent
brew
from
one
of
pas
solid
breweries
definetly
one
to
grab
if
you
can
find
even
go
a
bit
out
of
your
way
to
find
the
style
is
pretty
unique
and
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
to
represent
not
quite
dead
guy
ale
but
close
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
spices
and
hops
tastes
of
dry
earthy
hops
with
spices
mixed
in
well
the
finish
is
very
bitter
not
too
bad
though
still
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
doesnt
kill
the
taste
bud
but
packs
a
big
punch
try
it
d
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
brew
it
seems
to
have
an
unbalanced
sourbitterness
to
it
its
possible
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
drank
it
past
its
prime
but
its
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
cheers
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
in
the
body
some
grainy
flavors
emerge
and
there
is
a
slightly
vinous
grape
skin
tinge
to
the
beer
and
then
the
biting
spices
come
in
on
the
back
end
also
present
are
some
citrus
notes
and
a
very
peppery
bite
on
the
end
the
beer
is
quite
oily
on
the
tongue
and
full
bodied
there
arent
heaps
of
hops
in
this
beer
but
the
spices
add
the
bitterness
the
hops
are
in
the
noble
family
the
7
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
the
thick
pour
and
rich
consistency
makes
this
a
noteverydown
type
bock
watery
and
thin
this
is
not
dark
gold
or
dark
blonde
color
with
light
foam
head
and
small
active
prickle
mild
grain
nose
with
slight
malt
hints
clean
attack
and
grain
heavy
flavor
some
vague
hints
of
of
a
macrobrew
yet
some
sour
notes
toward
the
finish
a
passable
yet
ordinary
or
average
microbrew
i
could
see
some
mass
appeal
and
i
can
easily
envision
a
cooler
full
of
this
being
a
hit
at
a
barbecue
well
they
stopped
brewing
this
tasty
little
gem
in
may
so
i
guess
i
should
put
my
lazy
ass
in
front
of
the
computer
and
review
the
beer
before
the
small
remaining
supply
dries
up
for
the
year
i
have
got
to
say
i
likes
what
stoudts
does
blondie
here
pours
a
brilliant
honeygold
and
atop
sits
a
nice
tight
little
creamy
head
shes
a
lass
thats
easy
on
the
eyes
but
can
she
hold
a
decent
conversation
before
she
opens
her
mouth
though
i
get
a
whiff
of
her
perfume
sweet
sticky
malt
and
more
than
a
hint
of
the
clover
honey
they
use
to
brew
this
seasonal
one
sip
later
and
i
must
confess
there
is
more
going
on
here
than
just
a
pretty
face
fat
malt
sits
on
the
palate
but
it
isnt
too
heavy
or
syrupy
just
bigboned
a
dry
bitterness
runs
down
the
sides
of
the
tongue
lending
a
superb
drinkablility
and
it
all
ends
in
a
nice
honeyed
finish
that
slides
quickly
down
the
throat
i
can
safely
attest
to
having
too
many
of
these
on
several
occassions
and
though
no
animals
were
hurt
in
the
events
that
followed
many
a
questionable
camera
phone
picture
was
taken
so
yes
i
would
say
it
is
very
quaffable
and
will
cause
your
better
judgement
some
problems
all
in
all
she
is
a
fun
girl
who
will
take
you
for
a
wild
ride
given
the
right
conditions
d
the
sweet
and
oily
is
offset
nicely
by
the
dry
and
peppery
quite
malty
and
refreshing
drinkability
awesome
for
a
summer
beer
not
complex
but
refreshing
enough
to
drink
multiples
of
flavor
is
sweet
grainy
malt
with
some
caramel
and
rolls
to
a
spicy
hop
finish
that
lingers
lightly
on
my
palate
a
very
nice
clean
beer
that
hides
the
abv
very
well
and
is
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
especially
now
that
its
warmer
outside
its
a
bit
heavy
and
strong
for
a
sessionable
summer
beer
but
i
could
certainly
do
a
few
of
these
sitting
in
my
place
with
the
temperature
in
the
midlow
70s
definitely
give
it
a
shot
very
inviting
and
refreshing
d
the
flavor
is
full
and
has
the
intensity
of
a
substantial
mai
bock
the
drinkability
is
good
and
this
is
one
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
more
than
1
of
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
draft
version
but
both
are
very
nice
lagers
and
are
very
well
made
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
frothy
white
head
and
great
carbonation
aroma
is
sweet
but
not
quite
like
a
dopplebock
i
get
some
honey
some
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
aroma
a
nice
sweet
start
very
smooth
taste
with
a
malty
character
a
little
bit
of
fruit
in
there
apples
its
supposed
to
be
7
percent
abv
but
you
would
never
guess
overall
a
wellbalanced
beer
very
tasty
enjoyable
brew
that
i
would
certainly
have
again
worth
a
shot
poured
into
a
goblet
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
carbonation
is
low
even
though
it
is
a
lager
the
aroma
is
not
dominant
to
any
one
thing
there
is
a
slight
scent
of
honey
or
wild
flowers
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
but
overpowering
there
is
no
balance
but
i
wouldnt
expect
there
to
be
for
a
mai
bock
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
ut
oh
so
smooth
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
one
that
i
would
recommend
d
welcome
spring
this
is
a
freah
very
well
made
beer
that
delivers
nice
body
and
flavor
while
remaining
relatively
lighttasting
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
stoudts
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
german
inspired
beers
highly
recommended
this
is
actually
a
very
good
beer
and
we
will
have
it
again
soon
pours
a
very
light
clear
copper
hue
with
a
puffy
finger
and
a
half
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
goodness
bubbles
race
each
other
to
the
top
of
the
glass
get
in
my
belly
chunky
webbing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
love
it
smell
is
pretty
earthy
to
begin
with
but
the
sweet
caramel
malt
eventually
emerges
some
grassy
hops
and
sweet
honey
tickle
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
dirty
up
front
with
a
some
pepper
and
caramel
malt
some
buttered
biscuits
and
earthy
hops
midway
that
lead
to
the
bready
apple
aftertaste
medium
body
and
a
chewy
feel
with
a
soft
carbonation
very
good
representation
of
the
style
i
really
wish
more
breweries
would
give
maibocks
a
shot
thanks
josh
the
scratch
8
awaits
thanks
to
muenchenerkindl
for
this
one
the
beer
pours
copper
color
with
light
amber
hues
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
grass
spicy
hops
and
biscuity
malt
the
taste
is
full
of
hops
up
front
followed
by
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
maibock
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
certainly
a
good
one
i
like
its
large
amounts
of
both
malt
and
hops
i
could
happily
drink
this
all
spring
people
enjoyed
the
verdant
springy
aroma
and
taste
they
thought
the
beer
was
a
solidly
drinkable
one
even
if
some
complained
that
it
was
missing
something
in
the
way
of
being
a
complete
success
dthis
is
a
nice
spring
beer
when
the
weather
is
slightly
chilly
at
night
the
toasted
malt
is
a
nice
effect
and
cuts
through
the
sweet
edge
d
overall
drinkability
was
ok
a
tad
bit
over
carbonated
and
a
little
coarse
around
the
edges
distracts
from
enjoyment
the
7
0
abv
as
many
have
noted
on
here
is
only
a
number
i
dont
feel
it
at
all
as
im
enjoying
this
since
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
more
than
compensate
for
it
this
isnt
the
best
beer
ive
had
lately
but
for
this
time
of
the
year
it
fits
well
its
lighter
less
malty
and
not
as
burntcaramel
as
a
regular
bock
i
have
yet
to
sample
a
bad
beer
from
stoudts
and
this
is
no
exception
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
the
novice
beer
drinker
but
for
anyone
whos
got
some
palate
under
hisher
belt
this
is
a
great
way
to
welcome
in
the
warmer
weather
in
the
tradition
of
the
mai
bock
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
spring
the
herbalcitrus
balance
is
a
welcome
prompt
that
a
new
season
is
on
the
way
flavors
of
sour
fruit
with
a
medium
hopping
crisp
citrus
lemon
bitterness
spicy
dry
finish
with
a
yeasty
bread
aftertaste
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
creamy
white
head
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
apricots
wheat
honey
spice
grass
and
lemon
tastes
of
grass
mixed
with
wheat
up
front
with
a
sweet
honey
and
candied
spiced
fruit
backbone
and
a
crisp
lemon
finish
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
fairly
hoppy
for
a
maibock
but
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
fruity
malt
note
and
the
flavor
focuses
on
spicy
ground
pepper
hops
with
a
light
malt
balance
theres
a
semidry
finish
with
a
medium
bitterness
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
paired
with
moderate
carbonation
made
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
try
this
maibock
if
you
like
euro
hops
d
the
7
abv
is
not
noticeable
this
is
certainly
sessionable
d
nice
maibock
with
some
sticky
bitterness
and
plenty
of
sweetness
to
balance
well
done
a
very
unusual
and
enjoyable
brew
a
clear
golden
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
medium
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
toasted
wheat
cereal
with
a
grape
edge
maybe
even
some
orange
very
delectable
unique
and
intriguing
the
flavor
is
a
bit
mellower
than
the
aroma
a
mild
more
of
a
piney
hops
background
with
a
creamy
feel
very
pleasantly
surprising
for
a
bock
at
the
back
of
your
mouth
is
a
very
neat
flavor
that
is
like
rye
toast
really
nice
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
alcohol
does
not
seem
to
strong
but
the
taste
is
grand
overall
not
too
bad
at
all
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
from
stoudts
appearance
is
red
copper
with
a
nice
head
that
stays
the
entire
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
honey
being
the
dominate
flavor
the
taste
is
very
earthy
with
lots
of
honey
at
the
front
and
the
end
leaves
a
sweet
taste
in
your
mouth
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
it
is
very
light
for
a
7
it
has
a
nice
light
to
medium
body
i
love
this
stuff
and
will
keep
drinking
it
as
long
as
it
is
out
i
will
have
to
get
a
case
the
next
time
i
go
up
i
nice
light
spring
to
early
summer
delicious
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
i
drank
my
first
one
i
wasnt
sure
it
was
really
on
style
however
it
is
a
helles
bock
however
a
bit
unconventional
ill
probably
drink
this
one
again
pours
a
light
amber
with
just
a
collar
for
a
head
the
aroma
is
very
sulphurous
although
there
is
some
mild
vienna
malt
backing
and
a
hint
of
berry
fruits
on
the
palate
brisk
carbonation
and
overpowering
sulphur
along
with
fairly
robust
acidity
combine
for
an
impression
that
is
overall
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
big
and
brash
with
nothing
in
the
way
of
subtlety
things
get
a
bit
softer
but
no
more
interesting
or
well
executed
at
higher
temperatures
but
overall
id
have
to
pass
on
this
one
next
time
a
solid
beer
ill
have
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
of
this
stuff
as
it
was
quite
tasty
though
at
7
abv
one
shouldnt
have
more
than
a
few
good
beer
cheers
d
a
good
beer
from
stoudts
another
beer
from
them
that
i
am
sure
would
be
worlds
better
fresh
ontap
at
the
brewery
overall
flavor
was
subdued
and
just
wasnt
exciting
strong
alc
content
in
this
d
drinkable
decent
beer
overall
the
alcohol
is
undetectable
and
that
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
im
not
sure
i
know
this
beer
after
two
bottles
but
i
will
revisit
it
many
times
and
will
certainly
buy
more
than
two
bottles
next
run
its
a
pleasant
sipper
light
yet
surprisingly
complex
and
along
with
their
tripel
my
favorite
stoudts
offering
so
far
scott
lightsmoothjust
a
slight
bit
wateryi
expected
it
to
have
a
bit
more
body
very
easy
drinkingcould
drink
a
few
of
thesejust
not
all
night
a
beer
worth
a
trywould
be
a
good
beer
for
a
wine
drinker
overall
a
decent
maibock
from
a
brewery
that
i
think
makes
some
great
beers
and
some
relatively
poor
beers
this
one
is
pretty
good
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
id
say
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
helles
fan
drinkability
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
but
no
way
would
i
do
an
entire
six
pack
the
beer
itself
is
solid
but
nowhere
near
my
loaf
of
bread
its
the
first
time
i
would
call
the
malt
character
harsh
good
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
flavorful
and
enjoyable
the
mouth
is
lightbodied
yet
offer
a
nice
velvety
fruitiness
balanced
out
by
the
warm
malts
and
late
mild
surge
of
hops
very
drinkablea
great
summertime
beer
that
offers
enough
flavor
to
be
acceptable
solid
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
about
a
1
5
inch
pillowy
foamy
head
smelled
like
you
just
caught
a
whiff
of
someone
making
bread
with
their
window
open
near
the
ocean
on
a
warm
spring
day
no
im
not
writing
this
while
drinking
taste
was
light
and
sweet
a
bit
of
caramel
flavor
to
go
along
with
soft
maltiness
body
was
pretty
light
although
not
watery
overall
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
really
gold
and
very
clear
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
turns
to
a
patch
in
the
center
of
the
beer
nice
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
of
the
class
corn
smell
and
a
faint
hop
smell
corny
taste
with
a
small
hop
taste
and
nothing
else
really
mouthful
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
i
think
that
is
from
the
high
abv
quite
refreshing
and
smooth
i
like
this
but
i
was
expecting
a
darkermore
robust
beer
it
was
solid
though
but
nothing
i
would
have
again
real
fast
in
the
future
overall
a
nice
brew
that
quenched
my
thrist
for
a
springtime
offering
nice
flavors
and
good
balance
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
well
balanced
beer
overall
it
poured
a
bright
golden
honey
color
that
had
a
massive
and
i
mean
massive
head
of
white
pillowy
foam
all
i
did
was
pour
only
an
ounce
or
two
of
this
beer
and
up
comes
this
massive
head
of
white
foam
from
out
of
nowhere
and
almost
overflowed
this
tall
glass
the
retention
was
too
good
because
i
had
to
wait
4
minutes
before
i
could
actually
get
to
the
beer
itself
in
its
aftermath
it
left
plenty
of
white
sticky
lace
and
white
foamy
rings
around
the
glass
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
juicy
fruits
at
first
and
then
that
drifted
away
into
toasted
grains
a
touch
of
caramel
a
dash
of
pepper
and
into
some
crisp
floral
hops
the
smell
ended
with
the
floral
hops
but
the
taste
began
with
those
floral
hops
after
that
there
were
some
toasted
malts
a
small
touch
of
juicy
fruits
caramel
some
spices
a
slight
drop
of
alcohol
and
then
it
finished
with
those
floral
hops
that
were
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
there
was
also
some
yeast
in
there
but
of
course
that
was
only
toward
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
with
a
very
mild
aftertaste
of
those
floral
hops
that
keep
showing
up
again
and
again
the
beer
overall
was
a
very
nice
light
beer
thats
easily
drinkable
i
know
it
says
it
has
7
abv
but
i
dont
believe
it
would
i
drink
another
one
i
wouldnt
mind
another
one
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
good
choice
on
a
nice
warm
spring
day
d
dont
pound
this
beer
the
abv
will
whoop
you
quickly
it
is
though
a
good
sipper
with
a
lot
going
on
drinkability
this
hies
its
alcohol
very
well
complexity
might
make
it
hard
to
drink
for
some
deep
golden
center
with
pale
gold
edges
frothy
cottony
lacy
white

sugary
malts

light

slightly

with

pear
rinds
stick
around
for
a

pretty
good
maibock
medium
body
with
a
moderately
syrupy
feel
nice
carbonation
surprisingly
good
and
ill
have
to
get
more
of
this
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
wellbalanced
beer
very
drinkable
the
seven
percent
abv
is
notable
but
not
a
hinderance
this
bock
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
malty
vinous
munich
malt
and
biscuity
malt
the
taste
was
malty
with
light
munich
malt
flavor
but
with
a
cereal
grain
flavor
and
with
a
modest
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
was
dry
but
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
aftertaste
was
also
dry
this
was
fairly
drinkable
for
its
abv
and
the
flavor
grew
on
me
mouth
good
mouthfeel
of
strong
carbonation
flavor
is
malty
and
light
very
grainy
with
excellent
malt
and
bread
tastes
nothing
like
the
smell
warmth
comes
up
on
the
exhale
making
this
one
an
okay
drink
even
for
cold
weather
after
taste
is
like
sweet
fresh
bread
plus
a
slight
bitter
hop
flavor
notes
will
have
to
rerate
a
fresh
batch
mouthfeeldrinkability
sharp
and
tingly
in
the
mouth
then
subsiding
slightly
the
mouthfeel
lumbers
through
its
motions
unfortunately
this
beer
doesnt
recover
from
the
harshness
of
just
about
all
of
its
attributes
and
i
am
shocked
at
the
outcome
either
this
came
from
a
bad
batch
or
this
beer
is
not
what
it
was
two
years
ago
horrifically
disappointing
cheers
final
thought
stoudts
does
it
again
with
this
refreshing
but
simple
bock
if
you
want
to
drink
higher
abv
beers
during
the
summer
maibocks
are
the
way
to
go
and
this
is
a
prime
example
of
the
style
delicious
its
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
nor
as
fruity
the
combination
comes
together
very
nicely
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
red
hue
smell
is
pungent
mostly
of
malts
with
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
refreshing
mostly
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
as
it
goes
down
the
stickyness
of
the
large
amount
of
malts
comes
through
and
cancels
out
the
hop
but
lingers
with
a
slight
zest
the
malts
linger
for
about
15
seconds
then
slowly
dissove
with
saliva
mouthfeel
is
good
very
drinkable
you
may
forget
that
its
7
and
have
more
than
a
few
this
goldenamber
brew
happens
to
be
one
of
the
best
americanmade
maibocks
ive
come
across
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
its
quite
smooth
its
nicely
grainy
but
dry
and
its
got
that
restrained
apricot
fruitiness
that
is
typical
of
better
german
maibocks
the
finish
is
mild
but
lengthy
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
not
as
rich
a
maibock
can
and
should
be
none
the
less
highly
recommended
pours
a
strawberry
blonde
color
with
a
tannish
head
and
some
nice
head
smell
is
very
hard
to
gage
a
bit
floral
and
sweet
but
not
potent
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
of
hops
and
fruity
quite
fruity
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sudsy
and
chewy
overall
mostly
drinkable
but
a
little
harsh
like
they
tried
a
bit
too
hard
a
nice
beefy
lager
is
what
this
is
well
balanced
well
rounded
well
done
carbonated
apple
juice
thats
what
it
looked
like
at
least
a
translucent
light
brown
with
a
lingering
white
head
upon
smelling
it
i
noticed
a
slightly
floralcitrusapple
aroma
with
a
sweet
hint
of
alcohol
i
detected
appley
sp
notes
in
the
taste
as
well
mostly
it
was
a
crisp
and
clean
brew
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
that
balanced
the
small
hints
of
alcohol
i
want
to
say
it
also
had
hints
of
sweet
straw
yeast
this
beer
seemed
like
a
winner
until
the
flavor
takes
a
dive

all
and
all
a
good
beer
but
a
little
over
priced
here
in
lansing
the
taste
really
lost
me
on
this
one
it
had
limited
hops
swirling
around
even
for
a
maibock
though
it
started
out
as
honey
filled
breadiness
it
was
quickly
lost
over
to
all
grains
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
chewy
as
expected
and
came
off
as
thin
little
boozy
warmth
on
the
end
finished
sweet
but
not
with
the
feeling
of
needing
future
ones
a
solid
and
interesting
maibock
perfectly
inbetween
boring
and
complex
and
enjoyable
well
brewed
nicely
balanced
and
very
clean
d
very
tasty
beer
perfect
for
enjoying
on
the
porch
with
a
warm
spring
sun
and
cool
breeze
alcohol
is
slightly
above
average
but
not
going
to
sit
you
down
another
fine
offering
from
stoudts
slàinte
nice
maibock
here
full
of
banana
and
light
hop
flavor
on
the
back
end
wonderful
malty
goodness
on
the
front
end
not
much
smell
here
but
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
and
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
i
recommend
this
one
as
this
style
is
very
hard
to
find
well
maybe
not
hard
to
find
but
hard
to
find
a
great
one
899
its
got
some
hefty
mothfeel
to
it
and
as
far
as
drinkability
well
how
do
like
your
bocks
this
time
of
year
this
is
an
american
classic
example
of
an
old
world
style
we
dont
see
enough
of
of
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
pours
out
to
a
deep
gold
color
with
a
lively
head
of
white
foam
broken
lines
of
lace
surround
the
interior
of
the
glass
very
little
aroma
but
notes
of
roasted
nuts
and
malts
were
detected
flavors
of
hops
and
malt
dominates
but
goes
nowhere
with
little
depth
or
development
in
the
taste
dept
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
borders
on
watery
drinkability
is
decent
when
you
consider
that
this
is
7
abv
ive
had
better
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
modest
white
puffy
head
smell
is
fruity
bubble
gum
malt
and
absolutely
perfect
taste
is
somewhat
dissapointing
its
almost
as
if
the
smell
promised
me
something
that
the
taste
just
doesnt
deliver
a
strange
metallic
taste
is
at
the
front
and
any
sweetness
to
be
found
is
overpowered
by
a
too
strong
hop
bitterness
very
strong
alcohol
presence
also
noted
finishes
with
very
strong
alcohol
dominating
all
other
tastes
in
all
the
beers
that
i
have
reviewed
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
such
varying
scores
for
smell
the
different
aspects
of
the
rating
it
was
difficult
to
finish
this
beer
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
lowmedium
body
not
too
complex
but
complex
enough
to
keep
your
interest
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
not
one
to
rave
about
but
pretty
good
clear
dark
orange
with
a
smallish
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
a
light
coating
of
lace
sweet
and
fruity
with
light
notes
of
honey
some
bready
malts
were
in
the
aroma
as
well
flavor
was
similar
with
the
sweet
fruit
and
honey
over
doughy
malts
very
light
hoppiness
pretty
thick
body
almost
too
much
so
for
this
beer
easy
drinking
enough
i
finished
the
bottle
without
problems
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
come
back
for
seconds
pours
out
in
a
pretty
golden
stream
filling
the
glass
results
in
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
light
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
a
little
oxidation
nothing
outstanding
but
ok
tastes
sweet
malty
barely
noticeable
bitterness
somewhat
cloying
good
mouthfeel
not
overcarbonated
very
smooth
overall
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
warming
crisp
dry
finish
drinkability
interesting
flavor
profile
but
that
finish
is
offputting
this
was
nice
but
i
dont
know
quite
what
to
think
of
it
it
looked
nice
deep
clear
orange
with
big
fluffy
white
head
and
decent
retention
thick
lacing
smell
was
sweet
with
a
definite
yeast
presence
there
didnt
seem
to
be
a
whole
lot
to
the
taste
although
it
was
very
clean
and
had
a
smooth
finish
this
seemed
kinda
big
and
had
a
heavy
presence
in
my
mouth
pleasant
but
filling
i
dunno
this
one
was
a
bit
strange
being
pleasant
but
void
of
taste
simultaneously
weird
recommended
stoudts
is
really
impressing
me
lately
with
anything
i
choose
by
them
maybe
its
time
for
a
visit
to
pa
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
not
enough
going
on
here
to
bring
me
back
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
maibock
is
not
a
style
i
have
come
across
frequently
so
i
cant
speak
for
the
faithfulness
of
this
beer
to
the
claimed
style
on
its
own
merit
i
found
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
strong
lager
prosit

overall
impression
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
full
bock
flavor
with
a
great
color
recommended
nice
amber
color
decent
head
when
poured
into
a
tulip
smells
clean
and
malty
maybe
like
new
bread
taste
is
big
and
malty
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
bock
some
german
hops
on
the
finish
im
not
picking
up
too
much
of
a
honey
sweetness
but
rather
the
biting
sensation
you
get
when
eating
a
spoonful
of
raw
real
honey
you
know
not
the
clear
processed
stuff
from
the
grocery
store
but
honey
with
character
mouthfeel
is
decent
drinkability
is
about
one
for
me
but
its
a
sipper
that
goes
down
very
nicely
not
sure
of
the
age
of
this
one
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
malty
doughy
pastrylike
sweet
aroma
is
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
about
this
beer
theres
essentially
no
hops
in
the
aroma
but
instead
theres
a
very
appealing
maltcharacter
a
slight
undertone
of
sulfur
a
little
butterscotch
and
an
earthy
yeastiness
the
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
just
a
little
haze
and
a
beautiful
stable
head
the
lace
is
intricate
interlocking
and
truly
beautiful
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
very
little
hops
and
very
little
roasted
character
the
label
says
that
the
beer
is
brewed
with
honey
but
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
it
out
its
blended
very
well
with
the
malt
considering
the
abv
and
the
amount
of
flavor
the
body
has
a
lightness
about
it
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
pours
with
a
onefinger
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
amber
color
low
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
malty
starts
with
semisweet
raisins
finishes
mellow
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
higher
abv
is
not
noticable

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
olivers
beverage
albany
ny
thanks
to
santoslhalper
for
the
sample
in
the
glass
its
a
very
nice
clear
amber
brew
with
a
decent
orangetinted
head
that
went
away
quickly
leaves
a
little
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
and
some
nice
spotty
lacing
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
a
very
sweet
smell
with
a
tiny
hint
of
spices
and
alchohol
mostly
malty
very
good
smelling
though
draws
you
right
in
a
nice
and
warm
tasting
beer
starts
off
very
smooth
with
a
full
malt
body
hints
at
honey
and
fruits
finshes
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
a
nice
bitter
grass
flavor
very
well
done
so
well
balanced
it
will
keep
drinking
for
quite
some
time
hides
its
7
abv
very
well
so
drink
carefully
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
reasons
but
stoudts
blonde
double
maibock
impresses
me
it
isnt
great
at
anything
but
its
good
at
all
things
sort
of
a
bock
of
all
trades
forget
justification
i
just
like
it
taste
was
interesting
smooth
yet
heavier
than
most
mai
bocks
ive
had
low
carbonation
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
sweet
fruits
with
very
little
hop
character
but
a
larger
alcohol
warming
in
the
end
oily
feel
wasnt
refreshing
was
a
bit
overbearing
i
liked
it
but
not
enough
to
buy
another
this
beer
looks
fantastic
with
an
orangish
gold
glow
and
sparkling
carbonation
but
could
use
a
nicer
longer
lasting
head
smell
is
a
sweet
fruity
malt
and
a
faint
earthy
hop
taste
is
a
melting
pot
of
flavors
of
residual
honey
sweetness
tangy
peach
fruit
and
earthy
but
indescrete
hop
flavor
following
is
a
warming
alcohol
burn
that
is
not
overpowering
this
is
comparable
in
taste
and
drinkability
to
a
triple
and
very
enjoyable
this
arrived
as
a
wonderfully
active
beer
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
head
dotted
with
bubbles
it
was
of
a
beautiful
light
amber
color
approaching
a
golden
yellow
i
noticed
a
sweet
honeylike
fragrance
on
the
nose
there
was
a
sort
of
hot
mouthfeel
on
the
tongue
but
it
was
neither
overpowering
nor
lingering
it
has
a
sweet
bite
not
of
honey
but
of
something
else
that
i
just
cannot
put
my
finger
on
there
is
maltiness
evident
in
the
mouth
finally
the
finish
is
crisp
perfect
for
a
huumid
afternoon
in
pa
for
someone
who
does
not
really
like
hefeweizens
ill
start
by
saying
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
style
is
right
up
my
alley
even
with
the
alleged
generous
amount
of
honey
added
it
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
beautiful
pillowy
head
the
immediate
aroma
is
sweet
malts
followed
by
a
nice
hoppiness
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
heavy
on
the
honey
and
with
some
hints
of
orange
and
nice
hops
on
the
tail
end
the
body
was
silky
and
smooth
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
enjoyable
the
whole
way
through
in
my
opinion
it
shares
a
lot
in
common
with
rogue
dead
guy
my
alltime
favorite
anytime
beer
but
the
blonde
double
maibock
can
be
overly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
catches
up
with
you
pretty
quickly
if
youre
enjoying
more
than
one
hence
my
lower
drinkability
score
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
that
ill
definitely
enjoy
again
and
recommend
to
others
note
my
bottle
read
blonde
double
maibock
and
stated
that
it
was
brewed
under
contract
in
fredericksburg
md
for
stoudts
a
nice
not
your
everyday
brew
to
be
had
here
though
it
could
be
its
appearance
is
a
pure
copper
clear
with
mild
carbonation
that
provides
a
good
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
some
sticky
rings
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
hints
of
citrus
and
honey
the
taste
is
pure
caramel
malts
with
a
hints
of
the
honey
though
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
chewy
the
beer
is
so
smooth
drinkability
is
favored
overall
a
suprise
for
this
was
the
first
for
me
of
this
style
and
this
brewer
good
stuff
nice
copper
color
decent
initial
head
leaves
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
malty
fruity
with
a
honey
presence
taste
is
full
with
a
strong
malt
presence
honey
element
are
present
mainly
in
the
smoothness
it
gives
mouthfeel
is
rounded
chewy
and
reminds
you
to
sip
this
offering
mouthfeel
is
heavy
imo
a
bit
oily
also
but
not
in
a
distarcting
way
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
alchol
presence
is
there
too
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
but
this
was
a
good
brew
appearance
deep
amber
honey
golden
hue
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
creamy
orange
tinted
head
leaves
intricate
even
lacing
down
my
glass
aroma
rich
sweetness
with
alcohol
around
the
edges
a
mild
touch
of
fruitiness
but
overall
theres
alot
of
depth
in
this
brew
finishes
with
a
touch
of
german
noble
hops
taste
very
quaffable
big
malty
layers
of
reserved
fruit
and
alcohol
but
so
damn
tasty
all
topped
off
with
a
mild
dose
of
semi
herbal
grassy
hop
flavoring
with
low
bitterness
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
even
carbonation
no
complaints
drinkability
great
stuff
easily
consumed
and
great
flavor
profile
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
fluffy
12
light
beige
head
formed
which
although
being
somewhat
short
lived
laced
ok
brew
is
an
orangeycopper
hue
and
has
an
aroma
which
first
brings
to
mind
the
alcohol
youd
expect
from
a
dopplebock
but
in
this
case
it
is
tempered
by
a
pleasant
fruity
essence
taste
is
remarkably
wellbalanced
for
a
dopplebock
with
the
fruitiness
adding
a
nice
dimension
and
the
honey
smooths
the
ride
none
of
the
cloying
sweetness
that
some
achieve
very
easy
drinking
kind
of
scarily
so
largely
because
of
the
impressive
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
real
maibock
so
i
may
be
biased
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
this
poured
a
clear
orangegold
with
a
sticky
frothy
white
head
which
left
medium
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
sweet
caramel
malts
dried
fruits
pears
raisin
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
the
taste
had
a
heavy
malt
base
with
nice
fruit
and
floral
overtones
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
very
clean
but
had
an
assertive
bitterness
near
the
end
to
cleanse
the
palette
overall
it
was
a
little
sticky
but
i
liked
it
the
alcohol
was
very
warming
but
hidden
extremely
well
i
finished
a
750ml
with
no
problem
and
a
nice
buzz
so
yes
very
drinkable
indeed
edit
i
went
outside
and
this
beer
makes
a
lot
more
sense
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
bitter
musty
smell
with
the
addition
of
light
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
great
for
a
higher
abv
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
good
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
real
sessions
beer
a
good
drinker
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
from
stoudts
that
ive
had
robust
yet
smooth
with
terrific
complexity
to
the
malt
a
perfect
beer
to
usher
in
summertime
and
leave
winter
behind
im
definitely
getting
this
again
next
year
this
was
a
beer
i
anxiously
anticipated
and
i
am
not
disappointed
at
all
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
a
treat
in
my
opinion
it
falls
short
of
capitals
classic
maibock
and
blonde
doppel
bock
which
for
some
reason
dont
garner
a
lot
of
support
from
east
or
west
coast
tasters
i
digress
back
to
this
beer
very
good
tasty
well
made
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
prost
a
bit
tangy
for
me
but
well
done
pours
a
deep
hazy
honey
liquid
with
an
impressive
lasting
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
both
malty
sweet
and
sharp
with
hints
of
caramel
and
honey
the
initial
malt
flavor
is
quite
raw
with
a
deep
sharp
bitter
bite
and
minimum
spice
the
honey
really
comes
through
in
the
finish
through
a
bitterness
that
expands
through
the
brew
very
complex
and
tasty
with
or
without
honey
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
do
recommend
the
larger
stoudts
brewed
bottles
instead
of
the
12
oz
contract
bottles
the
little
brothers
of
this
never
tasted
this
good
honey
double
mai
bock
not
as
sweet
as
it
once
was
and
more
hoppy
than
in
recent
years
still
a
very
drinkable
bock
with
a
malty
taste
that
keps
asking
for
more
the
alcohol
is
not
really
present
until
you
have
had
a
few
and
then
stand
up
very
fresh
and
balanced
bock
worth
tasting
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
honey
color
that
seemed
to
be
decently
carbonated
it
produced
a
decent
head
of
a
light
beige
color
that
was
creamy
thick
sticky
and
lasted
fairly
well
and
created
some
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
reviewing
this
beer
was
done
in
2
stages
first
pour
which
would
be
straight
from
the
cold
and
second
pour
which
allowed
it
to
warm
up
several
degrees
cold
aromas
were
of
caramel
sweet
malt
grains
warm
aromas
were
of
caramel
flowers
light
hops
sweet
malt
grains
some
leaf
and
light
fruit
the
taste
cold
were
of
sweet
malt
hops
noble
grain
and
a
slight
roasted
malt
warm
tastes
were
of
creamy

alcohol
flowers
and
a
roasted

aftertaste
cold
dry
flowers
hops
aftertaste
warm
malt
up
front
mixed
with
hops
in
the
back
creamy
and
balanced
cold
this
beer
was
on
the
dry
side
while
warm
it
became
creamy
and
pleasant
also
warm
produced
a
nice
warming
alcohol
feeling
cold
medium
bodied
warm
slightly
heavier
body
a
good
beer
fresh
from
the
fridge
quenched
the
thirst
a
much
better
beer
as
it
warmed
became
creamier
and
filling
decent
for
the
style
my
suggestion
is
to
get
the
beer
take
it
out
of
the
fridge
let
it
warm
a
few
degrees
and
breath
then
drink
you
will
enjoy
very
good
beer
thanks
gavage
for
the
recommendation

nice

taste
is

more
accurately
with
more
honeyish
tastes
mixed
with

a
nice
shortlived
bitter
blast
of
hoppiness
appears
to
dry
things
out
a
bit
finishes
on
a
clean
note
very
much
the
quaffable
brew
i
havnt
had
many
maibocks
but
this
is
the
best
ive
had
better
than
dead
guy
imo
great
brew
note
this
bottle
is
clearly
labeled
as
blonde
not
honey
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
but
its
not
my
style
personally
i
think
they
did
well
here
and
ill
have
it
again
a
really
nice
maibock
pours
clear
with
nice
white
head
both
aroma
and
taste
are
hop
forward
perhaps
a
little
lighter
malt
base
than
is
typical
frankly
i
detect
very
little
malt
to
this
its
more
like
a
pale
version
of
a
pale
ale
with
a
distinct
but
mild
hoppiness
and
little
else
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
would
be
marketed
as
a
blonde
doppelbock
its
a
disappointment
overall
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
pours
a
lighter
amber
in
color
with
a
2finger
white
head
left
good
lacing
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
malty
grain
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
sweeter
than
the
aroma
with
perfect
carbonation
the
flavors
of
caramel
malts
and
grains
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
citrus
very
surprised
at
a
good

of
brew
was

my
favorite
comments
love
this
beer
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
had
and
really
turned
me
on
to
craft
beer
i
hadnt
had
it
in
a
while
and
wondered
if
it
still
lived
up
to
my
memories
of
it
happy
to
say
it
has
held
up
well
still
a
really
wonderful
beer
as
good
or
better
as
my
memories
final
thoughts
ive
had
better
maibocks
than
this
one
perhaps
the
bottle
was
a
little
further
past
the
expiration
date
than
i
thought
couldnt
find
a
date
anywhere
on
the
bottle
if
you
like
a
big
blast
of
malt
then
this
one
will
give
you
that
but
it
really
doesnt
even
do
that
completely
well
o
much
more
bitter
than
most
bocks
ive
had
i
actually
like
the
change
worth
trying
and
buying
for
a
bocky
change
medium
bodied
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
with
average
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
am
surprised
it
took
this
long
to
sit
down
and
write
a
review
light
caramel
bready
notes
are
highlighted
here
sweet
with
a
light
undertone
of
some
herbal
hops
peeking
though
a
light
touch
of
dark
fruit
perhaps
possibly
but
a
sweet
caramel
malty
lager
type
aroma
is
what
is
predominant
here
caramel
and
toffee
hints
of
buttery
like
notes
persisting
now
as
it
comes
up
in
temperature
my
first
brew
from
august
schell
brewing
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
ill
have
another
drinkability
wow
all
i
can
think
about
right
now
is
the
five
bottles
of
this
still
chilling
in
my
fridge
how
am
i
going
to
make
myself
drink
them
the
first
bottle
became
tolerable
after
it
warmed
for
about
10
minutes
but
otherwise
i
was
very
disappointed
i
hope
it
was
a
bad
bottle
overall
a
very
solid
version
of
a
maibock
from
shells
sidenote
proud
to
be
the
100th
review
of
this
brew
overall
pretty
good
will
enjoy
again
im
sure
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
solid
if
not
overly
exciting
brew
this
is
one
of
the
first
august
schell
beers
ive
had
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
maifest
pours
a
light
copperorange
color
there
is
a
nice
head
on
this
beer
that
lingers
and
laces
the
glass
as
you
drink
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasing
smell
almost
sweet
the
maifest
has
some
very
good
flavor
too
nothing
overpowering
though
i
find
the
7
2
abv
to
be
very
well
hidden
i
recommend
having
this
beer
i
know
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
d
i
thought
i
might
be
disappointed
in
this
beer
but
i
was
rather
surprised
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
august
schell
and
one
i
would
certainly
recommend
for
a
try
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
little
out
of
my
range
for
favorite
styles
very
malty
definitely
balanced
to
the
sweet
side
flavors
are
a
bit
heavy
not
at
all
what
i
would
call
refreshing
or
crisp
its
a
smooth
cool
weather
beer
that
isnt
a
sipper
or
a
pounder
itll
take
some
time
to
get
thru
it
but
not
a
lot
of
time
d
pretty
good
brew
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
schells
but
still
a
good
drinker
glad
i
had
the
brew
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
schells
maifest
feels
mediumsized
with
an
effortless
bite
and
tingle
it
goes
down
nicely
and
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
almost
as
if
it
just
experienced
a
butterscotch
sunday
but
still
shy
of
that
cloying
characteristic
a
lot
of
maltygoodness
in
this
brew
cant
forget
to
point
that
out
im
certain
i
could
sit
at
a
bar
and
savor
45
pints
of
this
one
cheers
context
instead
of
drinkable
i
brought
this
home
and
opened
the
first
too
soon
not
allowing
time
to
cool
properly
that
was
a
wasted
drink
third
beer
which
is
where
this
review
comes
from
300
in
afternoon
se
minnesota
overcast
day
june
done
with
work
a
pleasant
brew
to
enjoy
while
waiting
for
the
family
to
get
home
relaxing
or
talking
with
friends
over
an
evening
pre
summer
fire
pit
or
bbq
incidentally
the
fourth
and
fifth
went
very
well
with
seasoned
grilled
balltip
steak
and
fried
red
potatoes
d
i
could
probably
get
a
few
down
but
is
a
little
sweet
and
the
hop
character
can
be
a
bit
offputting
i
think
drinkability
overall
its
an
okay
maibock
but
is
simply
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
for
my
personal
tastes
picked
up
the
maifest
from
schell
i
liked
it
better
than
summits
version
in
that
it
hides
the
alcohol
much
better
the
flavors
seem
to
meld
together
well
a
pretty
good
beer
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
for
a
spring
day
conclusion
not
bad
really
but
not
something
ill
probably
go
back
to
schells
has
a
few
quite
tasty
beers
this
isnt
one
of
em
imo
pours
a
surprisingly
lively
deep
corngolden
nice
billowey
frothy
head
but
it
dissipates
fairly
fast
doesnt
smell
like
much
almost
like
thanksgiving
maize
a
bit
nutty
a
bit
roasty
clean
lager
smell
tastes
clean
a
bit
nutty
but
not
that
real
sharpness
you
sometime
get
clean
and
smooth
not
the
fullest
feeling
but
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
dead
guy
for
example
d
this
is
a
good
if
not
great
maibock
it
could
stand
a
bit
more
complexity
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
pours
a
clear
copper
color
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
maibock
helles
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
sweet
malt
and
slight
roasted
malt
and
very
slight
hop
overall
a
refreshing
maibock
with
good
body
and
easy
drinkability
it
might
not
have
the
complexity
but
still
a
good
maibock
d
very
good
drinkability
for
a
7
beer
this
stands
up
to
the
better
maibocks
out
there
yes
even
capital
very
nice
brew
d
pretty
high
i
would
order
another
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
maifest
is
medium
in
body
and
seems
to
fit
the
stylenot
as
substantial
as
a
doppelbock
but
not
watery
either
the
cherry
and
alcohol
presence
seems
to
make
the
finish
a
bit
astringent
though
this
isnt
unpleasant
while
the
abv
isnt
low
i
felt
like
the
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
probably
because
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
arent
overstated
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
schell
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
20
oz
went
quick
it
seems
to
be
a
very
simple
beer
with
not
to
many
big
flavors
attached
to
it
i
could
have
more
in
a
night
nowhere
near
a
drainpour
but
i
wasnt
impressed
considering
how
many
other
great
maibocks
there
are
really
enjoyable
and
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
maibocks
are
wonderful
and
although
schells
isnt
a
favorite
brewery
this
is
my
sixth
schells
their
maifest
is
wholly
satisfying
another
above
average
beer
from
schells
nothing
special
but
definitely
a
good
beer
dive
loved
this
brew
for
many
years
now
and
am
again
pleased
with
this
brew
smooth
very
flavorful
and
interesting
this
brew
is
one
to
savor
each
spring
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
but
i
found
the
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
and
not
at
all
complicated
better
then
bmc
not
expensive
would
make
a
decent
sessionparty
beer
the
flavor
is
pretty
light
i
mean
it
probably
doesnt
even
need
to
be
poured
in
a
glass
dont
get
me
wrong
i
will
always
buy
a
6
or
12
pack
of
this
in
the
spring
but
that
is
it
give
me
the
schells
dark
or
stout
any
day
yes
the
taste
is
fruity
with
whole
wheat
up
front
a
bit
pungent
sweet
with
some
bitterness
and
a
clear
hint
of
the
alcohol
strength
however
the
alcohol
element
starts
to
overpower
the
rest
the
flavour
quickly
degrades
and
it
becomes
very
rough
with
a
light
but
sharp
and
unpleasant
bitterness
becoming
evident
the
result
is
that
the
beer
smacks
your
mouth
a
bit
but
without
much
flavour
its
also
heavy
and
strong
for
the
low
flavour
and
quickly
gets
tiresome
d
this
is
a
good
brew
the
high
abv
is
a
little
bit
hindering
as
far
as
sessionability
but
i
would
pick
this
up
in
a
heartbeat
flavor
is
some
caramel
and
grainy
malt
with
just
a
bit
of
fruit
apricot
maybe
but
then
the
flavor
rolls
to
some
earthy
and
spicy
hops
not
very
bitter
but
dominant
on
the
palate
no
abv
hints
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
wish
that
the
flavor
and
nose
were
a
little
bigger
but
overall
the
beer
is
nice
to
drink
and
is
extra
good
on
this
hot
june
evening
drinkability
while
the
abv
could
keep
this
from
being
sessionable
the
taste
and
ease
of
consumption
do
not
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
or
filling
tasty
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
too
many
of
this
i
would
get
more
of
this
if
i
can
this
spring
before
it
is
gone
i
maybe
too
late
already
tasted
on
32508
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
i
dont
think
ill
seek
it
out
in
the
future
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
not
quite
fullbodied
but
close
decent
carbonation
nice
and
crisp
and
quite
tasty
on
a
spring
day
d
it
is
an
excellent
warm
spring
day
brew
it
is
smooth
has
good
mouth
feel
and
enough
kick
to
be
fun
has
a
medium
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
some
life
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
me
to
rate
drinkability
higher
drinkability
goes
down
easy
a
little
on
the
fruity
sweet
side
but
a
perfect
spring
beer
left
me
a
bit
more
buzzed
then
i
intended
to
be
i
would
definatly
buy
this
again
summit
maibock
would
be
my
preference
over
this
beer
though
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
not
too
bad
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
overall
the
taste
didnt
really
live
up
to
the
smell
and
appearance
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
something
i
will
visit
often
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
large
frothy
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
biscuit
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
lot
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
as
vibrant
as
the
aroma
with
a
long
noble
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
a
wonderful
maibock
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
mouth
feel
is
smooth
alcohol
is
hidden
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
this
beer
really
helped
to
raise
my
hopes
that
springs
right
around
the
corner
too
bad
the
weather
hasnt
been
as
agreeable
drinkability
about
as
fun
as
being
eaten
by
sand
weevils
not
too
bad
but
a
schells
seasonal
that
i
have
fond
memories
of
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
that
i
particularly
like
about
this
beer
very
warm
very
creamy
mediumfull
body
with
excellent
carbonation
unfortunately
its
just
too
sweet
and
sticky
to
really
enjoy
particularly
with
the
aboveaverage
alcohol
content
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
minimal
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
had
somewhat
of
a
spicey
aroma
to
it
taste
was
malty
but
not
too
sweet
something
is
missing
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
ok
but
i
would
definitely
not
seek
out
pours
a
fizzy
golden
tan
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
very
nice
smell
sweet
and
almost
fruity
the
taste
is
decent
rich
and
malty
a
smooth
flavorful
impressing
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
heavy
yet
it
consistently
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
is
excellent
expecially
when
considering
the
heavy
feel
surely
recommended
i
was
confused
to
see
this
described
as
bock
as
it
poured
a
pale
gold
in
the
glassbut
have
since
learned
that
maibocks
are
less
malty
than
traditional
bocks
lots
of
floral
hoppy
aroma
but
not
obnoxiously
hoppy
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
and
dangerously
so
at
7
abv
very
active
carbonation
holds
its
thin
head
for
quite
a
while
a
great
beer
for
a
lazy
weekend
afternoon
on
the
back
porch
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
from
august
schell
i
wish
that
i
had
more
than
just
one
on
hand
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
rich
clear
golden
with
well
formed
fluffy
1
12
finger
white
head
good
carbonation
and
head
retention
to
this
brew
notes
of
caramel
malt
some
veg
in
the
nose
somewhat
light
but
noticeable
a
hint
of
floral
hop
as
well
pretty
light
in
the
mouthfeel
department
lightly
sweet
but
quite
crisp
caramel
sweetness
being
the
dominant
flavor
up
front
with
underlying
white
grape
skin
flavors
and
moderate
toastiness
as
well
a
lighter
spring
bock
but
of
decent
quality
and
it
is
drinkable
for
the
style
d
tastes
like
nothing
ive
had
before
but
i
would
not
try
this
one
again
part
of
a
sampler
pack
purchased
at
dinkytown
wine
and
spirits
mpls
d
good
session
beer
if
was
more
easily
available
in
my
area
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
find
very
refreshing
deffinatly
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
maibock
very
tasty
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
very
drinkable
if
youre
in
this
mood
id
come
to
expect
less
of
the
beers
in
the
sample6pack
after
my
first
experience
with
one
and
after
reading
the
reviews
but
this
is
one
fine
beer
drinkability
despite
possibly
inconsistent
style
elements
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
a
bit
light
on
the
tongue
for
the
strong
flavors
at
the
end
of
the
beer
but
fairly
drinkable
not
too
bad
overall
drinks
about
average
too
far
departed
from
the
grand
style
of
the
motherland
for
me
to
reccomend
this
beer
by
schells
gives
their
firebrick
lager
a
run
for
its
money
brownish
amber
in
color
slight
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
of
pale
and
caramel
malts
initially
the
flavor
is
a
bit
grain
like
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
but
it
has
a
great
finish
almost
similar
to
drinking
an
apple
cider
rather
sweet
and
fruity
this
is
a
solid
mai
bock
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
could
have
more
than
2
or
3
but
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
maifest
is
probably
my
third
favorite
asbc
beer
after
pale
ale
and
pilsner
it
needs
a
little
more
something
although
im
not
sure
what
if
you
love
the
style
or
even
like
it
and
its
available
where
you
live
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
go
it
isnt
exactly
my
bock
but
it
might
be
yours
over
all
i
like
this
beer
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
drinkability
pretty
easy
12

sweet
green
apple

to
full

quickly
leaving
spotty
lacing
down
the

sweetish
aroma
tastes
of
pear
and
licorice
a
nice
maibock
i
havent
had
this
before
but
will
have
it
again
schells
makes
a
good
beer
when
they
try
got
this
in
a
trade
and
i
can
not
find
my
paper
on
who
sent
it
to
me
but
thanks
who
ever
you
are
from
the
bottle
poured
a
copper
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
aroma
there
sure
is
some
malts
in
there
and
hops
lemon
flavor
a
a
like
on
the
weak
side
malts
and
hops
with
a
tanging
lemon
and
a
touch
of
molasses
as
it
warmed
not
to
bad
session
beer
if
i
could
get
more
mouthfeel
is
where
i
like
to
see
it
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
glad
to
try
this
one
but
not
itching
to
have
another
d
this
beer
has
a
surprising
maltyness
for
the
light
body
but
it
has
lots
of
good
character
good
complexity
and
very
well
built
this
beer
is
light
in
color
but
big
on
flavor
this
is
one
grand
springtime
beer
grab
a
sixer
when
it
starts
warming
up
outside
and
go
sit
by
a
river
or
in
a
field
or
something
or
just
drink
them
at
home
in
front
of
your
computer
with
the
window
open
light
shade
of
copper
nice
clarity
medium
sized
dirty
white
head
lacing
is
moderate
thick
juicy
malts
on
the
nose
and
fruits
grapes
and
apples
come
to
mind
nice
sweet
aroma
this
leads
into
a
nice
sweet
flavor
profile
with
a
lot
of
the
same
in
common
with
the
nose
the
apples
and
grapes
and
also
pears
are
noticeable
and
sweet
sweet
malts
without
being
cloying
hops
only
provide
balance
and
are
undetectable
save
for
a
slight
dryness
to
the
finish
the
body
is
full
and
round
and
the
carbonation
delicate
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
schells
with
the
possible
exception
of
their
hefe
much
different
then
i
remember
the
ontap
version
being
malt
levels
are
very
inyourface
and
almost
has
a
raw
feeling
to
it
alcohol
is
also
very
present
in
the
taste
i
would
almost
say
this
could
be
a
candidate
for
aging
for
a
year
perhaps
ill
buy
a
12er
and
drink
one
every
month
for
a
year
still
worth
trying
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
sweet
caramelly
brandy
malt
flavors
up
front
but
these
are
tempered
by
some
bitter
vegetal
hops
overall
more
on
the
bitter
side
for
a
maibock
malt
gets
reduced
to
a
vegetablecarrot
flavor
near
the
end
finish
stays
bitter
fullbig
body
and
almost
too
mouthcoating
drinkability
and
overall
i
liked
this
one
again
with
schell
they
are
good
beer
but
there
is
a
macro
feel
to
them
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
just
cant
taste
the
attention
to
detail
with
these
beers
like
i
do
other
craft
beers
i
know
thats
very
subjective
but
thats
the
best
way
i
know
how
to
describe
it
a
good
but
not
great
beer
a
summer
cheers
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
spring
seasonal
from
august
schell
super
crystal
clear
agate
amber
color
with
a
puffy
finger
high
head
of
offwhite
foam
that
fizzes
away
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
allover
skim
lacing
drips
back
in
quick
leaving
very
minimal
spots
aroma
is
highly
sweet
of
fresh
bagel
dough
and
lighter
caramelness
with
vanilla
dulled
grasses
and
slight
banana
esters
underneath
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
very
sweet
and
malty
charge
from
front
to
back
thats
dulled
of
fruitycandyish
waffer
cookie
things
with
small
hints
of
grassy
herbal
spices
peaking
around
the
edges
of
the
palate
some
grainysweet
corn
like
sweetness
mixes
in
there
at
a
nonthreatning
level
always
keeps
a
decent
balance
of
malty
sweetner
slightly
crisp
and
drying
in
the
finish
medium
body
feel
but
overall
slightly
chewy
and
buttery
slick
but
in
a
light
way
not
heavy
this
was
surprising
to
say
the
least
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
one
il
have
again
and
again
this
beer
is
a
dark
goldlight
brown
color
with
a
bubbly
cream
head
on
the
top
the
scent
is
that
malty
maibock
scent
we
all
know
and
love
taste
is
malty
pretty
typical
for
maibockm
greater
emphasis
on
bitter
hops
than
usual
for
the
style
also
has
some
weird
taste
like
copper
pennies
or
something
nothing
horrible
but
not
the
best
blended
brew
not
a
bold
version
of
style
more
subtle
than
i
normally
think
of
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
good
though
id
never
say
no
to
one
a
creamy
offwhite
head
rests
lazily
above
a
clear
goldenamber
body
as
very
finebubbles
rise
steadily
upwards
the
head
holds
quite
well
and
it
maintaina
a
solid
covering
throughout
most
of
the
glass
additionally
the
lacing
is
nice
except
that
it
doesnt
seem
able
to
stick
to
the
glass
and
disappears
momentarily
the
nose
reveals
a
limited
amount
of
malt
some
mild
fermentation
esters
and
a
light
note
of
alcohol
its
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
due
to
its
full
body
and
very
fine
moderate
carbonation
a
rich
grainy
malt
displays
a
light
touch
of
toastiness
and
some
mild
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
and
its
wellbalanced
by
a
low
level
bitterness
that
barely
emerges
except
to
help
dry
the
finish
along
with
a
wash
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
apparent
however
and
tends
to
intrude
halfway
through
the
glass
still
its
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
could
readily
be
enjoyed
as
one
of
the
first
beers
of
spring
pours
to
a
hazy
deep
golden
color
the
head
fades
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
yeasty
spicy
and
caramel
malty
the
flavor
has
the
caramel
malts
spicy
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
this
as
an
okay
beer
not
up
to
par
with
other
maibocks
it
is
a
definite
warmer
mediumbodied
and
easy
drinking
for
its
strength
schell
maifest
a
brown
beer
with
golden
highlights
not
much
head
and
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
very
weak
aroma
but
thats
not
all
that
unusual
this
is
a
very
heavily
malted
beer
with
a
caramel
taste
that
is
somewhat
grainy
and
processed
there
is
a
pleasant
smoky
aftertaste
that
brings
the
taste
score
up
a
little
easy
drinking
but
ive
had
better
manifests
lately
thinner
and
fizzier
than
expected
needs
more
malt
more
heft
and
smoother
transitions
to
accomplish
the
blonde
double
bock
it
is
billed
bright
deep
gold
color
exactly
the
color
of
standard
bourbon

predominate
as

best
described
as
leaning

quality
with
a
bit
of
bitter
marmalade
mid
mouth
finishes
in
a
similar
vein
with
some
artificial
caramel
aftertaste
hops
may
contribute
slightly
to
the
bitter
orange
sense
overall
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
described
as
a
blonde
double
bock
but
the
malt
was
very
big
i
am
drinking
this
a
month
before
its
best
buy
date
the
nose
is
not
big
its
clean
with
a
hint
of
lightly
cooked
sugars
and
traces
of
light
grains
it
pours
brilliant
pale
gold
with
a
very
light
copper
tint
under
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
a
palate
of
light
grains
lightly
seasoned
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
could
benefit
from
a
soft
creamy
carbonation
medium
bodied
but
nearly
flat
and
the
absence
of
a
creamy
head
is
disappointing
this
beer
could
use
more
cowbell
overall
this
beer
while
lacking
in
appearance
and
aroma
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
the
taste
delicious
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
too
bland
for
my
taste
buds
bock
drinkers
would
like
it
light
mouthfeeljust
above
water
and
short
of
oily
and
bland
flavor
not
much
better
than
generic
megabrew
lager
imo
not
impressed
but
not
sent
screaming
from

glass
eithersmooth
drinker
for
being
slightly
over

abv
needs
either
a
different
hop
variety
or
more
of
same
perhaps
a
second
malt
of
rye
would
also
help
relieve
the
blandness
just
slightly
better
than
ok
a
disappointment
from
boulevard
who
brew
the
outstanding
smokestack
series
a
solid
bock
beer
with
a
definite
alcohol
edge
in
the
flavor
department
not
my
favorite
action
from
boulevard
whos
smokestack
series
is
unreal
but
their
regular
lineup
doesnt
always
impress
me
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
an
average
white
head
not
really
showing
much
carbonation
or
character
the
nose
is
simple
sweeter
golden
malt
light
toast
and
a
german
or
czech
style
hop
profile
which
is
just
slightly
bitter
but
not
enough
to
overcome
the
malty
sweet
i
would
like
to
see
some
more
hops
in
this
even
for
a
bock
its
out
of
balance
it
also
doesnt
have
the
grain
depth
and
complexity
of
the
better
bocks
around
this
is
clearly
a
mass
appeal
dumbing
down
of
the
style
not
particularly
interesting
but
its
very
easy
drinking
super
clean
feel
despite
the
sugar
and
good
enough
carbonation
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
beer
from
these
guys
who
usually
go
above
and
beyond
this
one
underwhelms
boss
toms
golden

a

the

has
a
crisp
clean
slightly
sweet
malty

pretty
weak

still

a
okay

oa
boring
beer
starting
to
think
the
style
is
just
a
boring
and
bland
one
onot
bad
but
not
great
either
this
is
an
average
brew
that
is
underwhelming
as
none
of
the
notes
are
too
pronounced
and
too
subtle
i
would
like
it
a
lot
more
if
the
body
was
thicker
this
is
a
lighter
version
and
a
nice
drinking
bock
in
which
a
couple
would
not
be
much
of
an
issue
i
think
its
a
little
lower
rated
because
of
it
lower
abv
and
softer
flavors
i
look
favorably
on
these
things
this
is
an
excellent
maibock
best
one
ive
ever
had
american
maibocks
ive
had
in
the
past
are
often
overhopped
but
this
one
is
superbly
balanced
a
delicious
and
refreshing
mixture
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
all
in
moderation
but
interesting
at
the
same
time
at
4
99
6pack
this
was
an
excellent
deal
i
highly
suggest
it
for
an
overall
wellrounded
beer
of
any
style
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
mellow
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
but
the
sweetness
is
more
nougat
and
not
much
malt
flavor
to
the
sweetness
the
watery
and
sulfur
taste
also
get
in
the
way
o
boss
toms
golden
bock
is
the
perfect
brew
for
those
of
us
who
seek
a
refreshing
summer
beer
without
resorting
to
the
adjunct
filled
rubbish
we
see
everyone
else
drinking
a
perfect
union
of
hops
malts
and
carbonation
make
this
the
obvious
choice
for
summer
refreshment
beer
is
medium
in
body
sweet
and
yeasty
nice
finish
easy
drinking
a
very
nice

not

o
maybe
this
was

close

the

i
found
it
to
be
bland
drinkable
no
off

just
not
very
satisfying
taste

sweetly
malty

zing
at

the
overall
effect
though
is

rather
than
hoppy
a
decent
brew
but
not
a
favorite
it
could
stand
some
more
flavor
but
overall
its
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
pleasing
flavor
and
somewhat
bold
finish
outside
of
their
smokestack
series
beers
to
me
this
is
one
of
their
best
i
prefer
it
to
the
alltoopopular
boulevard
pale
ale
as
i
see
it
falling
somewhere
between
the
pale
and
dark
truth
stout
on
my
list
of
boulevards
best
o
the
first
hit
of
caramel
in
the
flavor
threw
me
off
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
and
the
crackeriness
with
lightly
spicy
hops
hold
this
beer
to
style
and
save
it
certainly
worth
a
try
for
any
maibock
lover
o
another
pleasing
seasonal
from
boulevard
easily
a
nice
late
spring
session

not

overall
good

beer
here
but
nothing

this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
to
anyone
i
likely
wont
buy
it
again
but
thats
not
because
i
didnt
like
it
only
because
im
not
a
big
bock
drinker
in
general
good
brew
though
as
a
history
major
growing
up
and
educated
in
this
town
i
have
a
lot
of
resources
on

tom
too
interesting

if
youre
ever
in

and
want
to
hear
it
overall
this
is

it

is
that
it

nothing

great
session
boack
that
makes
me

for

not

overall
a

beer
nothing

nothing
terrible
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
seems
right
for
the
general
idea
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
bold
quaff
though
i
prefer
the
cheap
and
tasty
hofbrau
bock
from
trader
joes
decent
beer
all
around
no
complaints
but
have
had
better
more
flavorfilled
marzens
not
a
very
exciting
beer
its
odd
how
all
of
boulevards
6packs
are
bland
unexceptional
micro
beers
but
their
750s
are
so
interesting
and
generally
very
tasty
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
recent
addition
to
their
lineup
but
it
fits
their
6pack
character
overall
i
thought
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
was
just
a
bit
over
the
limit
of
what
i
find
enjoyable
but
it
didnt
completely
destroy
that
limit
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
like
the
style
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
its
not
boulevards
top
of
the
line
but
its
a
very
pleasant
seasonal
that
i
like
to
drink
after
a
hard
days
work
or
when
cleaning
house
on
a
saturday
afternoon
my
neighbor
loves
the
boulevard
brewing
co
and
i
am
the
lucky
recipient
of
the
many
tasty
brews
he
has
brought
back
with
him
from
his
travels
the
boss
tom
is
another
fine
output
by
this
amazing
brewer
the
color
was
golden
clear
with
white
foam
and
decent
carbonation
the
nose
was
not
much
grain
mostly
the
taste
however
was
well
balanced
not
much
grain
coming
to
the
forefront
very
smooth
and
drinkable
abosolutely
give
this
one
a
try
opinion
well
as
you
can
probably
tell
from
my
review
that
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
would
classify
it
as
a
bock
even
a
maibock
as
it
is
a
bit
light
all
the
way
around
to
hit
that
category
either
way
it
is
well
crafted
with
a
good
flavor
and
no
adjuncts
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
regular
offering
from
boulevard
now
or
if
it
is
a
seasonal
if
the
latter
i
will
probably
pick
up
another
6
pretty
soon
as
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
and
seem
to
recall
that
they
were
reasonably
priced
overall
its
good
o
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
bready
bock
nothing
phenomenal
here
but
a
nice
lager
nonetheless
overall
very
refreshing
and
crisp
but
still
offers
great
flavor
perfect
when
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
refreshing
lager
d
for
the
alcohol
and
style
thinks
drinks
rather
nicely
simple
but
tasty
d
very
refreshing
slainte
o
a
nice
uncomplicated
beer
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
more
of
these
while
they
are
still
in
season
d
easy
drinking
and
smooth
but
not
great
very
drinkable
o
im
liking
the
taste
less
and
less
as
i
drink
it
and
it
certainly
isnt
looking
any
better
overall
good
brew
here
nose
was
a
little
weak
but
other
than
that
it
was
good
hops
really
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
always
nice
to
see
a
maibock
in
a
breweries
lineup
it
seems
like
boulevard
goes
for
mild
drinkable
beers
except
for
in
their
smokestack
series
where
they
really
go
all
out
i
like
this
better
than
their
wheat
and
ipa
offerings
but
much
less
than
the
beers
in
the
smokestack
series
not
too
bad
but
not
really
worth
hunting
down
unless
youre
a
big
pale
bock
fan
i
prefer
the
somewhat
similar
glissade
but
i
can
imagine
that
fans
might
really
like
this
one
too
drunkability
not
bad
seems
to
be
a
pretty
standard
lager
sweet
and
not
too
complex
o
a
great
spring
offering
from
boulevard
this
is
one
to
look
forward
to
as
the
green
returns
boss
toms
golden
bock
was
orangegold
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
pale
malt
the
taste
was
pale
malt
and
some
peppery
spice
a
bit
sweet
upfront
and
drying
out
towards
the
finish
with
a
little
alcohol
becoming
noticeable
it
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
a
decent
maibock
but
not
the
best
that
ive
tried
feels
clean
crisp
and
wetting
to
the
palate
overall
a
great
beer
just
lacks
the
head
retention
but
there
are
german
maibocks
that
are
comparable
to
this
trait
the
beer
was
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
just
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
lemon
and
grass
with
just
a
bit
of
nutty
malt
it
tastes
of
lemon
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
along
with
some
sweet
malt
it
leaves
a
slightly
fruity
and
just
a
bit
bitter
aftertaste
the
beer
is
a
little
overcarbonated
in
my
opinion
but
does
leave
a
nice
dry
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
was
an
average
and
different
bock
i
would
drink
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it

i
want
to
preface
this
review
by
saying
that
the
bottle
says
best
by
61910
so
im
four
months
late
it
poured
very
watery
and
golden
in
color
with
a
light
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
was
very
flat
and
nothing
was
really
standing
out
at
all
the
taste
wasnt
too
bad
though
considering
the
date
it
was
light
and
sweet
with
the
lightest
of
hoppyness
accompanied
by
light
yeast
and
a
mellow
sweetness
it
drank
very
light
and
smoothly
little
carbonation
it
wasnt
too
bad
not
the
greatest
by
any
means
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
not
very
good
with
a
mix
of
corn
grass
and
grain
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
mix
of
grain
and
grassy
hops
dominating
the
palate
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
there
are
a
lot
of
good
beers
from
boulevard
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
nice
pleasant
but
not
particularly
noticeable
drinkability
was
great
and
perfect
on
this
first
day
of
fall
that
reached
record
temps
well
into
the
90s
picked
up
a
single
it
might
be
a
little
out
of
date
but
it
still
tasted
fine
i
liked
it
in
that
it
wasnt
too
sweet
or
boozy
like
a
lot
of
maibocks
ive
had
boss
toms
golden
bock
is
a
pretty
decent
maibock
from
the
folks
at
boulevard
while
this
will
never
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
balanced
nature
of
this
spring
seasonal
is
a
pleasant
surprise
purists
and
bock
lovers
may
disagree
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
tightly
packed
with
head
i
dont
get
a
ton
out
of
the
nose
of
this
beer
actually
get
a
weird
metallic
smell
then
a
sweet
smell
like
corn
the
flavor
is
pretty
subdued
as
well
nothing
really
standing
out
here
at
all
almost
has
a
fruit
taste
similiar
to
apple
juice
meh
nothing
really
special
here
no
hop
presence
to
really
speak
of
in
the
above
regards
i
guess
that
makes
it
smooth
tasting
as
it
really
is
easy
to
drink
probably
its
best
redeeming
quality
mediumlight
mouthfeel
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
oddly
of
soybeans
taste
is
light
malt
up
front
with
a
hint
of
zesty
herbal
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
tart
fruit
tasting
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
the
flavors
stick
to
your
tongue
in
not
such
a
good
way
drinkability
is
average
as
well
a
good
beer
however
that
gets
a
bit
cloying
after
you
have
a
full
one
drinkability
i
found
it
very
easy
to
down
the
2
pints
i
had
a
tasty
example
of
a
bock
try
this
one
if
you
like
maibocks
d
good
flavor
and
body
maybe
a
bit
hoppier
than
expected
a
good
sessionable
beer
thanks
again
blueokie
overall
an
okay
helles
bock
pours
an
eponymous
clear
gold
with
a
wispy
offwhite
head
a
splotch
or
two
of
lace
resides
here
and
there
smells
of
malt
damp
hay
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
lemon
tastes
malty
and
spicy
with
a
light
and
fruity
middle
mixed
with
a
bit
of
caramel
goes
down
smooth
with
a
good
little
petite
blonde
body
unsurprisingly
highly
drinkable
and
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
many
a
summer
occasion
flavor
starts
off
with
the
bubbly
mineral
nodes
of
a
good
summersippin
blonde
or
kolsh
this
quickly
turns
into
the
sweet
biscuit
and
long
lightly
alcoholic
caramel
nodes
youd
expect
in
a
bock
but
these
go
away
nearly
as
quickly
as
they
come
and
are
replaced
with
a
blonde
weediness
which
ends
on
a
lightly
buttery
note
of
alcohol
overall
i
good
drinking
beer
reminds
me
some
of
celis
pale
bock
from
back
in
the
day
i
really
like
it
d
not
bad
just
not
all
that
interesting
of
a
beer
i
could
drink
it
just
fine
without
complaint
being
over
6
is
a
plus
for
this
beer
d
average
to
good
for
the
style
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
for
the
most
part
this
is
just
kind
of
bland
though
not
really
bad
just
inoffensive
not
something
i
would
recommend
but
not
the
worst
thing
ever
drinkability
is
fairly
high
the
flavor
profile
is
simple
but
pleasing
the
abv
is
moderate
but
well
incorporated
and
easily
managed
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
seen
come
from
boulevard
but
its
a
solid
sipper
taste
is
very
nice
as
a
significant
amount
of
sweetness
comes
through
keeps
the
toastiness
low
and
lets
the
hops
do
the
bittering
on
the
finish
bready
and
biscuity
lending
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
notable
lager
yeast
taste
i
like
it
it
is
quite
possibly
the
best
helles
bock
i
have
had
made
in
the
us
of
a
has
a
touch
of
wheat
crispness
and
tang
in
there
as
well
not
much
negative
i
can
say
about
the
boss
a
rather
tasty
brew
from
kc
clear
golden
body
thin
and
wispy
off
white
head
lace
comes
in
sporadic
rings
malty
aroma
flavor
is
malty
on
the
bready
and
biscuity
side
of
the
malt
spectrum
not
overly
rich
but
solid
enough
mediumfull
body
with
farily
active
carbonation
for
a
maibock
nothing
here
that
begs
a
lot
of
attention
but
its
decent
enough
drinkability
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
would
gladly
have
a
few
of
these
outdoors
on
a
nice
sunny
day
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
for
the
style
d
very
drinkable
a
bit
less
malty
smooth
and
nicely
bittered
d
overall
a
decent
enough
maibock
however
the
hops
could
be
brought
in
a
bit
as
i
think
they
detract
somewhat
from
this
malt
focused
style
still
not
a
bad
beer
just
fairly
average
and
perhaps
not
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
though
pours
a
clear
golden
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
hint
of
honey
and
slight
clove
fits
the
style
of
a
maibock
helles
bock
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
grain
yeast
slight
citrus
slight
pale
hop
and
slight
sweet
malt
as
it
warms
overall
good
body
aroma
and
blend
if
any
complaints
the
grain
flavor
was
a
little
too
strong
d
enjoyable
tasty
but
not
overpowering
pours
from
the
bottle
a
crisp
clean
golden
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
on
the
nose
i
get
a
very
subtle
floral
hoppy
note
but
mostly
sweet
bready
malt
pretty
straightforward
flavors
here
more
sweet
bready
malt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hoppiness
nicely
carbonated
quite
refreshing
a
nice
example
of
the
style
pretty
good
on
a
dreary
colorado
spring
afternoon
another
interesting
and
acceptable
version
of
the
pale
bock
style
recommended
conclusion
it
it
alright
yup
am
i
anywhere
near
as
enamored
with
this
one
as
i
am
with
boulevards
other
offerings
nope
da
tasty
maibock
beer
i
liked
how
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
were
really
able
to
clearly
present
themselves
to
me
as
i
tasted
it
almost
flying
out
of
the
beer
and
onto
my
palate
the
boss
toms
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
which
is
very
bright
a
nice
foamy
head
bubbles
over
the
top
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
smell
is
very
subtle
but
some
nice
malts
and
hops
make
up
the
nose
taste
is
slightly
watery
but
a
nice
hop
finish
some
citrus
complexity
in
the
middle
but
not
much
else
going
on
with
this
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
light
bodied
drinkability
is
middle
of
the
road
i
did
drink
a
couple
of
these
with
dinner
but
may
skip
the
next
time
d
this
beer
honestly
didnt
do
much
for
me
its
a
decent
bock
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
review
was
written
to
lightspeed
champions
midnight
suprise
so
easy
to
drink
a
complete
nonthinker
this
is
a
great
summertime
beer
best
served
with
a
deck
chair
and
the
warming
sun
d
exceptionally
drinkable
great
for
a
hot
afternoon
notes
in
the
end
i
think
this
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
style
extremely
drinkable
and
i
plan
on
returning
for
a
six
pack
of
this
because
one
12oz
single
didnt
satisfy
me
a
wellmade
clean
lager
but
theres
not
much
else
to
say
its
a
subtle
style
but
an
even
subtler
beer
this
is
a
light
tasting
light
bodied
beer
that
fits
in
well
for
the
season
good
lawn
mower
beer
d
this
is
an
easily
quaffable
brew
but
i
dont
understand
the
relatively
high
rating
that
this
has
been
receiving
to
me
it
falls
into
a
similar
flavor
profile
as
a
lot
of
japanese
or
mediterranean
lager
definitely
head
and
shoulders
above
bmc
but
still
a
pretty
basic
beer
the
good
part
is
that
i
could
drink
about
a
million
of
these
without
really
thinking
about
it
tried
this
alongside
elysians
ambrosia
maibock
and
it
just
got
killed
this
sure
goes
down
simply
enough
i
think
that
this
is
the
weakest
boulevard
seasonal
of
nutcracker
irish
ale
and
this
here
maibock
nice
flavorful
clean
drinking
german
style
lager
not
quite
big
enough
for
my
liking
for
the
style
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
i
dont
think
this
compares
to
sn
glissade
as
a
maibock
but
this
is
a
good
beer
just
more
of
a
clean
drinker
than
a
sweeter
stickier
maibock

it

its

im
wondering
if
this
is
a
brand
new
beer
or
one
they
just
never
sent
before
will
definitely
drink
it
again
d
easy
drinking
not
filling
despite
its
carbonation
flavors
are
smooth
and
well
managed
abv
is
up
there
but
not
outrageous
this
is
a
darn
solid
maibock
and
a
great
session
candidate
the
name
is
the
best
name
in
beer
this
year
this
is
a
fitting
tribute
to
a
significant
figure
in
kansas
city
history
drink
this
beer
tastes
pretty
good
and
with
the
low
abv
would
make
for
a
really
easy
session
beer
this
is
nicely
done
as
with
many
clean
lagers
the
eleventy
jillion
percent
infinity
ibu
or
it
sucks
crowd
will
poohpooh
it
but
it
is
a
well
made
maibock
worthy
addition
to
the
seasonal
lineup
and
worth
seeking
out
mdmedium
body
and
a
little
over
carbonated
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
using
this
as
a
very
easy
path
into
craft
beer
from
macros
ill
use
it
next
time
im
easing
someone
in
d
this
is
a
really
good
maibock
im
glad
boulevard
made
a
style
that
is
relatively
rare
and
theyve
done
a
great
job
with
it
very
drinkable
indeed
compares
favorably
with
sn
glissade
mouthfeel
has
a
lightmedium
body
a
little
heavier
than
the
pilsener
but
still
crisp
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
would
be
great
with
a
heavy
meal
a
real
interesting
bock
from
these
guys
and
from

to
have

this
and
it
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
beer

on

smooth
slight

the

the

offputting
otherwise
it
is
an

maibock
at
best
overall
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
a
decent
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
was
expecting
a
little
more
bready
malt
and
thicker
mouthfeel
for
a
maibock
mouthfeel
drinkability
above
average
in
both
areas
i
got
this
bottle
in
november
but
the
maibock
label
is
more
apt
without
a
doubt
and
maybe
this
beer
could
pass
for
an
oktoberfest
as
well
d
this
isnt
what
i
expected
from
a
maibock
but
it
was
definitely
a
drinkable
easy
to
like
beer
assuming
that
the
number
printed
on
the
label
is
either
the
bottled
date
or
the
freshness
date
it
becomes
rather
obvious
why
this
beer
was
so
flat
and
full
of
nasty
sediment
in
the
bottle
bocks
arent
made
to
last
three
years
and
it
shows
i
have
a
feeling
that
had
this
beer
been
enjoyed
fresher
it
would
have
fared
rather
well
a
slightly
cloudy
yellowgold
body
the
aroma
is
light
malt
not
much
else
to
it
the
flavor
is
complex
and
surprising
for
a
bock
sweet
upront
with
some
clove
spice
notes
but
the
bitter
hoppy
finish
is
what
impressed
me
most
an
enjoyable
bock
that
is
easy
drinking
not
too
sweet
and
has
some
solid
bitterness
to
it
i
love
that
a
german
craft
brewer
has
made
it
to
colorado
but
i
would
drink
more
only
if
the
price
was
cut
in
half
zum
wohl
followed
up
the
weisse
bock
with
this
one
its
got
a
lot
to
live
up
to
pour
makes
me
think
more
of
blonde
dopplebocks
or
maibocks
a
deeply
straw
color
with
light
legging
but
also
light
on
head
formation
and
retention
quite
sweet
and
heavy
looking
aromas
of
straight
pilsner
malt
with
some
fresh
bread
yeast
notes
light
pears
apples
and
mild
alcoholic
spice
flavors
deliver
the
same
making
for
a
very
simple
beer
but
void
on
any
decoction
caramelization
or
melanoidins
simple
and
pleasant
on
the
surface
but
ultimately
lacking
depth
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
in
the
background
finishes
with
sweet
pilsner
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
warming
nice
pleasant
but
doesnt
provoke
conversation
went
down
easily
and
was
pretty
refreshing
albeit
kind
of
sweet
drinkability
not
my
favorite
mahrs
beer
i
generally
agree
with
most
of
the
previous
reviews
this
brew
is
very
understated
which
may
turn
some
people
off
i
wasnt
aware
it
was
a
maibock
when
i
bought
it
and
was
expecting
a
much
thicker
darker
beer
all
in
all
though
its
a
pleasant
drink
if
you
give
it
a
chance
a
good
and
easy
introduction
to
this
style
if
youre
used
to
drinking
american
crap
lagers
my
bottle
has
a
slightly
different
label

a

on
it

slightly
grassy
sweet
almost
but
not
quite

taste

one
dimensional
with

an
aftertaste
that
is
borderline
unacceptable
overall
a
quite
average
beer
golden

a

nose
of
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
some
lemon
and
orange
citrus
taste
is
likewise
lots
of
spices
tons
of
caramel
malt
lots
of
tasty
fruit
citrus
dried
fruit
raisins
specifically
full
creamy
body
with
good
carbonation
i
liked
this
one
nice
flavor
with
a
great
body
good
beer
at
a
good
price
dnotes
my
sense
is
that
this
is
a
pretty
well
constructed
bock
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
i
generally
do
not
find
them
particularly
drinkable
pours
out
chill
hazed
marmalade
has
a
good
sized
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
well
there
are
some
chunks
in
this
which
is
a
putoff
nice
lacing
rings
smells
typical
of
a
maibock
in
the
area
of
the
almost
worty
malts
i
get
a
lot
of
grape
nuts
from
this
honey
and
challah
as
well
theres
a
lot
of
that
maltiness
up
front
thats
pushed
out
by
a
strong
medicinal
character
and
somewhat
rough
hop
bitterness
herbal
and
grassy
hop
flavors
accompany
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fulsome
with
some
carbonation
that
goes
over
the
line
in
its
force
this
is
allaround
decent
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
there
were
some
really
great
things
about
this
beer
that
got
balanced
by
some
really
awful
ones
making
this
soso
md
rather
smooth
the
sweetness
and
complex
maltiness
lends
a
nice
smoothness
warming
and
full
bodied
an
all
around
stellar
bock
gold
in
color
quite
hazy
bubbly
off
white
head
sparse
lace
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
similar
to
all
others
of
theirs
the
palate
brings
me
sensations
of
dusty
malts
cereal
grains
and
sweet
malts
not
too
bad
but
not
that
great
either
its
pretty
sweet
but
not
quite
in
the
annoying
cloying
realm
body
is
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
feel
to
it
in
the
mouth
very
average
maibock
overall
here
this
is
completely
unlike
what
i
thought
i
was
getting
into
with
this
beer
completely
unique
drinkability
the
fruity
sweetness
grew
a
bit
boring
after
a
while
not
a
maibock
that
will
want
you
to
buy
a
bunch
of
these
taste
is
little
sweet
and
bitter
which
is
a
bit
sharp
the
beer
is
very
malty
and
must
have
a
big
amount
of
light
caramalts
in
there
which
make
the
body
medium
lower
the
drinkability
and
give
the
beer
its
vanilla
and
some
honey
taste
the
hops
are
almost
overpowered
by
the
fullness
of
the
body
the
beer
initially
came
across
farely
weak
but
would
grow
as
it
went
on
quite
sharp
and
with
a
full
citruisy
flavour
on
every
swig
a
cloudy
bright
orange
colour
not
much
nose
the
beer
is
a
decent
offering
and
easily
agreeable
but
far
from
anything
great
i
found
it
too
meek
for
a
bock
it
was
simply
a
little
sloppy
in
the
features
where
a
good
bock
should
stick
out
and
as
result
came
out
as
nothing
more
than
a
strong
german
style
lager
pretty
nice
example
of
the
style
a
refreshing
but
strong
lighter
beer
not
overly
challenging
to
the
palate
but
better
than
an
average
lager
i
would
recommend
it
for
fans
of
maltystyle
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
quite
a
rich
taste
but
full
in
the
mouth
a
little
flat
after
the
initial
pass
over
the
palate
on
a
hot
day
a
couple
of
these
would
hit
the
spot
overall
the
fourth
of
six
mahrs
brau
beers
that
each
cost
me
3
99
at
hollingshead
deli
in
orange
ca
this
one
had
too
many
faults
to
impress
and
resulted
in
a
brew
that
felt
very
average
overall
perhaps
a
fresher
sample
may
have
helped
but
even
so
i
found
this
one
just
had
too
many
holes
in
it
and
was
wanting
in
too
many
areas
initial
head
a
nice
bitterness

9
oz
bottle
mahrs
bock
beer
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
dark
yellow
color
its
quite
pale
for
a
bock
the
aroma
is
herb
tea
and
caramel
big
malty
flavor
tastes
like
bread
and
caramel
a
lemony
tangy
herbal
flavor
comes
in
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
great
drinkability
most
beers
this
malty
arent
so
easy
to
drink
yet
another
quality
offering
from
mahrs
drinkability
with
the
exception
of
the
metallic
finish
this
is
a
superb
maibock
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
had
a
syrupy
body
and
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
the
color
was
significantly
darker
than
macro
lagers
but
it
was
slightly
similar
in
color
i
was
not
expecting
that
much
i
was
wrong
even
with
the
thicker
body
it
was
fairly
light
on
the
stomach
this
is
definitely
a
great
spring
beer
and
one
that
i
will
be
recommending
to
friends
i
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
ill
just
point
to
other
pale
beers
that
similarly
paint
the
holy
in
a
glass
with
a
simple
trinity
of
pale
malts
light
hops
and
incredible
yeast
la
choulette
blond
duvel

dupont
a
beer
ive
worshipped
before
many
times
but
held
back
from
assigning
petty
numbers
and
weak
descriptors
who
readily
dissects
such
joyful
experience
id
rather
have
another
start
it
cold
and
watch
it
turn
over
and
over
widen
deepen
and
capture
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
helles
bock
indeed
pours
a
light
orangy
color
hazed
with
a
nice
white
head
to
it
smells
of
raw
sweet
malts
honey
and
a
peppery
spice
much
the
same
in
the
taste
malty
up
front
sweet
and
doughy
with
a
little
bit
of
a
grain
or
oat
taste
in
there
and
a
milk
and
honey
character
almost
meadlike
topped
off
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
profile
i
love
the
way
these
mahrs
beers
all
come
together
so
nicely
and
subtly
with
a
really
nice
medium
bodied
and
smooth
mouthfeel
always
so
drinkable
another
great
one
in
a
line
of
incredible
beers
from
mahrs
traded
a
ba
buddy
of
mine
for
this
bottle
when
i
stopped
in
for
a
visit
on
holiday
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
two
finger
offwhite
fluffy
head
over
a
very
cloudy
dull
lemon
colored
liquid
smells
rich
sweet
maltc
aramel
and
some
bock
some
hops
rough
and
mild
so
they
come
across
to
me
a
tettnanger
a
dab
of
honey
aroma
as
i
drink
the
beer
tatses
dry
with
a
hint
of
funk
thats
munich
malts
speaking
to
me
a
little
bit
of
dirty
tettnanger
hops
ties
into
the
malt
what
i
find
disturbing
is
an
intrusive
clove
flavor
that
doesnt
belong
i
wonder
if
this
one
is
starting
to
skunk
i
once
had
a
bottle
of
hofbrau
that
was
like
this
it
was
a
shadow
of
the
fresh
stuff
i
drank
in
munich
light
in
the
mouth
but
ahs
a
thick
sugary
feel
too
bad
about
the
clove
this
beer
was
going
to
rate
quite
well
edit

ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
a
solid
two
weeks
now
outrageously
unique
but
my
question
is
how
would
this
go
with
spicy
authentic
rouxbased
gumbo
i
think
it
would
go
pretty
well
with
it
in
fact
i
think
it
would
be
deliriously
good
with
any
southern
barbecue
plate
not
just
for
sipping
complex
balanced
and
bracing
mahrs
bock
has
a
light
haziness
and
is
golden
in
color
head
is
goodsized
and
creamy
the
aroma
has
a
light
malt
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
honeylike
smell
aroma
is
very
helleslike
but
stronger
the
taste
has
a
great
sweet
malt
flavor
very
flavorful
and
layered
a
sharp
sweetness
is
provided
by
a
honey
flavor
hops
provide
balance
and
some
bite
this
is
very
drinkable
and
represents
the
quality
i
expect
from
mahrs
brau

a
golden

color
with
a
suple
offwhite
head
that
thins
rather
quickly
very
sweet
smell
with
a
bit
of
a
malty
aroma
no
hops
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
very
clean
and
distinct
with
sweet
malty
flavors
and
a
bit
of
citrus
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
stand
up
and
dance
with
all
kinds
of
insane
and
odd
flavors
this
beer
is
straight
forward
and
good
with
a
strong

that
pleases
the
palate

taste
light
sweetish
nothing
from

is
only
middling

is
very
light
finish
on
the
forgettable
side
though
the
sweetness
is
coming
through
ah
i
get
itnow
its
a
maibock
why
didnt
i
realize
that
sooner
crown
me
for
the
king
of
fools
for
i
was
judging
this
against
the
wrong
criteria
but
theres
half
the
bottle
left
with
which
to
contemplate
this
rich
buttery
tasty
sweet
and
full
of
character
a
terrific
maibock
never
going
overboard
in
the
sweetness
department
yet
still
delciciousness
personified
yum
not
such
a
bad
thing
out
of
bamberg
is
it
now
pours
out
a
honey
yellow
to
settle
a
light
pale
chill
hazed
golden
yellow
tall
puffy
white
head
that
has
a
larger
bubbly
structure
within
that
sits
awhile
before
floating
away
to
a
very
thin
haze
and
thin
collar
and
lace
sticks
in
minimal
strings
aroma
aint
much
but
whats
there
is
quite
pleasant
of
a
soft
pretzeled
bread
thats
slightly
sweet
and
malty
taste
has
more
of
the
same
with
a
good
length
of
mild
sweetish
tones
mixed
with
a
dry
breadiness
thats
a
bit
like
a
pretzel
with
just
a
touch
of
sea
salt
in
there
finish
fades
into
some
more
dryness
with
some
lighter
biting
hops
and
a
small
herbal
quality
feel
is
quite
smooth
with
a
soild
medium
body
and
bits
of
dryness
all
throughout
with
a
very
nice
mild
creamyness
this
stuff
is
quite
nice
a
nice
surprise
compared
to
the
christmas
bock
mahrs
makes
an
overall
very
drinkable
nice
little
maibock
session
material
all
the
way
this
bock
bier
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
malty
with
some
vegetable
aroma
the
taste
was
good
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
vegetable
not
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
it
was
slightly
sweet
up
front
but
dry
overall
and
hoppy
in
the
finish
this
was
a
very
nice
bock
bier
not
much
here
plain
jane
overall
its
not
my
bag
really
but
its
a
good
beer
a
touch
too
hoppy
for
me
but
its
still
true
to
style
im
not
sorry
i
tried
this
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
bocks
and
blonde
pales
and
want
to
mix
it
up
a
bit
the
body
is
a
sturdy
one
a
medium
that
isnt
too
heavy
for
the
style
and
offers
a
nice
less
than
overbearing
thickness
off
a
fluffy
carbonation
that
seems
to
lighten
it
one
the
tongue
without
taking
from
the
body
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
smoothness
and
crispness
both
of
which
remain
strong
decent
it
seemed
better
in
the
past
but
it
could
just
be
me
overall
very
good
beer
and
very
enjoyable
this
may
become
one
of
my
goto
spring
beers
overall
this
was
a
very
big
flavored
and
rather
tasty
easy
drinking
maibock
at
a
decent
abv
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
others
d
a
very
drinkable
warm
weather
bock
light
and
crisp
with
some
firm
malt
presence
and
nice
hop
bitterness
really
well
done
like
i
am
finding
most
of
summits
brews
without
flaw
would
have
again
overall
i
highly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
lot
of
what
i
love
in
beers
good
specialty
malts
great
hop
selection
and
a
superb
overall
job
again
the
downfall
of
this
beer
begins
and
ends
with
the
mouth
feel
it
is
also
disappointing
that
this
beer
is
entirely
too
grainy
and
not
malty
enough
for
a
bock
taste
was
a
creamy
grain
and
raisiny
sweetness
very
lightly
toasty
light
but
firm
grassyspicy
bitterness
very
faintly
herbal
with
raisiny
bready
aftertaste
feel
was
nice
and
creamy
overall
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
nothing
amazing
but
good
enough
for
a
layover
on
my
way
home
o
goodlooking
maibock
that
doesnt
quite
deliver
in
other
categories
i
greatly
prefer
boss
toms
from
boulevard
here
in
kc
the
only
reason
i
mark
this
down
a
little
is
that
the
bitterness
surprised
me
i
didnt
expect
so
much
hops
in
this
style
nevertheless
i
will
probably
drink
this
again
overall
very
nice
mai
bock
and
though
i
am
not
a
mai
bock
fan
i
could
drink
this
again
and
again
not
bad
at
all
a
touch
hoppier
than
i
like
in
the
style
but
very
well
done
and
still
quite
fantastic
o
this
beer
looks
really
nice
but
the
nose
and
tastes
are
somewhat
uninteresting
good
brew
lots
of
complexities
and
pretty
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
from
summit
and
come
next
spring
ill
probably
go
for
it
again
at
least
once
definitely
a
far
cry
from
your
typical
macro
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
at
6
7
abv
its
no
session
beer
but
drinks
like
one
would
pair
nice
with
a
salad
or
chicken
entree
o
this
is
a
nice
maibock
another
solid
seasonal
offering
from
summit
this
beer
works
well
with
the
german
new
age
composer
popol
vuh
and
his
cd
aguirre
that
is
written
for
the
movie
aguirre
the
wrath
of
god
starring
the
iconic
klaus
kinski
and
directed
by
his
cohort
herzog
kindofthe
scorsese
duvall
team
of
germany
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
maibocks
ive
had
for
me
the
standard
is
hb
maibock
and
every
one
i
try
is
compared
to
that
one
this
one
is
not
quite
there
as
the
color
is
too
light
its
not
as
chewey
and
the
lemony
spice
from
the
hops
doesnt
compete
with
the
peppery
notes
you
get
with
hb
still
this
is
very
good
look
is
light
orangeamber
clear
with
a
small
yellowwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
light
malt
grain
apples
pears
taste
is
crisp
crackers
white
bread
overripe
fruit
apples
pears
oranges
a
bitter
fruity
finish
mediumlight
body
with
ok
carbonation
dry
but
not
overly
so
for
a
spring
seasonal
i
really
enjoy
summits
version
of
the
maibock
this
seems
quite
hoppy
for
a
bock
but
im
not
all
that
familiar
with
the
maibock
style
all
around
i
found
it
uninspiring
nice
lacy
head
though
medium
body
nondescipt
beerish
smell
some
ok
citrus
notes
through
the
hops
but
not
thrilling
id
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
myself
my
aggro
pour
created
twoplus
fingers
of
eggnogcolored
head
with
good
retention
the
beer
itself
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
that
would
make
midas
and
croesus
envious
and
cause
greg
koch
to
call
me
a
wussy
i
like
beers
that
look
like
beer
i
also
like
to
bury
my
nose
in
my
beer
and
this
had
a
big
malty
sweetness
to
it
which
will
make
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
recent
spate
of
big
hoppy
beers
next
i
like
to
fill
my
mouth
with
beer
until
my
cheeks
bulge
out
like
a
chipmunks
and
let
the
beer
just
roll
around
on
my
tongue
this
method
is
not
recommended
with
sixpoints
resin
as
the
beer
acted
like
a
hydrofluoric
acid
burn
and
wormed
its
way
into
my
tongue
through
all
of
my
weak
link
tastebuds
here
it
warmed
with
a
soothing
softness
and
although
it
was
a
bock
it
was
not
cloying
or
overly
malty
they
struck
a
nice
balance
between
too
sweet
and
too
dry
i
do
not
mind
dry
beers
but
style
is
style
after
all
finish
was
semidry
and
very
pleasant
to
just
sit
and
sip
on
a
lazy
afternoon
the
price
point
was
very
nice
and
would
easily
warrant
a
revisit
lacing
light
fruity
esters
and
a
grainy
nose
with
floral
notes
the
body
is
more
floral
with
a
grainy
background
and
a
light
spicy
bitterness
the
beer
finishes
clean
with
a
malty
sweetness
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
seems
like
a
great
regular
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
a
fairly
satisfying
helles
all
the
right
targets
get
hit
closely
but
there
are
some
flavors
i
could
do
without
some
of
the
malt
profile
the
ethanol
still
this
is
a
decent
version
of
the
style
do
this
is
an
easydrinking
strong
lager
that
represents
its
style
reasonably
well
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
find
an
americanbrewed
maibock
that
does
not
cross
the
line
of
restraint
so
integral
to
the
german
stylebut
this
beer
makes
the
cut
it
is
the
balance
of
restraint
and
memorable
qualities
that
makes
this
more
enjoyable
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
refreshing
and
light
for
almost
7
alcohol
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
pretty
dark
gold
brew
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
and
doesnt
really
have
any
distinct
elements
to
it
the
taste
is
quite
nice
hints
of
orange
and
floral
with
a
mellow
malt
back
the
hop
element
is
low
key
and
pleasant
it
goes
down
with
a
bit
of
a
tingle
and
lets
that
sweetness
linger
its
a
nice
easygoing
beer
that
would
appeal
to
many
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
wish
i
could
my
hands
on
it
more
easily
in
the
maibock
season
a
delcious
sweet
and
bready
maltiness
that
represents
ths
tyle
wvery
well
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
pretty
decent
looking
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
thin
and
kind
of
scattered
about
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
grain
on
the
nose
and
some
hops
the
taste
brought
those
two
elements
along
onto
the
tongue
and
ended
up
being
pretty
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
had
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
totally
give
this
one
another
try
one
day
overall
easy
enough
to
drink
it
would
definitely
be
a
summer
beer
preferably
outside
on
the
lawnmower
light
flavors
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
keep
it
refreshing
abv
is
just
under
7
is
virtually
undetectable
im
actually
surprised
its
listed
as
that
high
because
it
doesnt
really
seem
like
it
would
be
overall
a
decent
beer
hoppier
than
a
normal
maibock
quite
tasty
o
overall
this
beer
is
solid
looking
forward
to
having
another
o
not
bad
makes
for
a
good
springtime
adult
beverage
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
no
maibock
has
ever
really
blown
my
socks
off
this
is
a
fairly
nondescript
beer
overall
with
muted
flavor
but
is
a
reliable
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pleasant
decently
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
beverage
o
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
summit
they
never
let
me
down
that
being
said
its
somewhere
in
the
middle
for
me
as
far
us
their
offerings
go
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
on
regular
basis
but
its
not
a
bad
choice
once
or
twice
in
the
spring
o
drinkable
and
refreshing
nothing
special
and
not
may
favorite
helles
enjoying
it
on
a
fire
sale
so
i
may
have
another
a
great
lager
and
maibock
at
first
this
was
just
a
standard
lager
but
lots
of
subtle
nuances
come
out
as
this
breaths
and
warms
up
excellent
and
highly
recommended
overall
a
little
dissapointing
it
looked
impressive
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
the
flavors
were
a
bit
subdued
still
tasty
enough
for
second
try
o
not
a
bad
effort
but
i
could
definitely
ask
for
more
hop
personality
and
a
better
nose
drinkability
crisp
and
clean
it
has
a
nice
zip
to
it
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
maibock
but
this
version
pales
in
comparison
with
its
german
ancestor
overall
decent
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
have
a
special
interest
since
touring
the
brewery
overall
a
nice
version
of
a
maibock
nothing
outstanding
but
pretty
good
o
nice
malty
springtime
beer
with
floral
notes
and
citrusy
hops
only
real
drawback
is
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
which
comes
through
quite
strong
in
both
taste
and
smell
notes
average
beer
that
didnt
really
pop
it
was
decent
but
there
was
just
too
much
musty
grain
flavor
overall
just
nothing
exciting
that
would
make
me
want
to
get
it
again
pours
clear
and
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
head
of
white
foam
falls
slowly
leaving
some
lace
smells
clean
to
slightly
sweet
clean
malt
flavor
dominates
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
character
towards
the
finish
very
balanced
finish
not
too
sweet
for
a
maibock
bit
of
minerals
in
the
finish
and
a
little
hop
bite
as
it
warms
up
very
smooth
mouthfeel
decent
body
for
the
style
not
bad
but
not
necessarily
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
that
makes
it
really
memorable
but
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
i
say
this
beer
is
okay
not
perfect
but
pretty
drinkable
alcohol
only
become
notable
near
the
end
not
a
bad
beer
d
not
a
stunner
but
pretty
much
what
i
expect
from
a
maibock
crsip
smooth
and
refreshing
a
great
beer
to
welcome
the
spring
although
not
too
much
to
differentiate
it
from
a
lot
of
the
other
maibocks
out
there
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
its
still
decent
drinking
opinion
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
i
guess
i
am
a
little
too
picky
or
something
i
like
my
beers
drier
and
more
lively
with
a
more
reserved
hop
addition
all
that
said
this
beer
has
hope
as
it
tastes
like
it
was
intended
to
be
a
maibock
but
i
would
just
cut
back
on
the
bittering
hops
and
use
a
more
attenuative
yeast
it
sounds
like
i
am
doing
a
homebrew
review
but
that
is
the
case
with
this
beer
there
are
no
flaws
in
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
and
i
am
not
minding
drinking
it
one
bit
but
it
is
falling
short
of
what
i
would
expect
for
a
maibock
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
see
this
out
already
but
not
enough
to
turn
it
down
it
pours
a
clear
paleish
straw
topped
by
a
large
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
corn
and
very
light
honey
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemongrass
greens
flowers
light
orange
peel
and
wheat
the
first
two
elements
contribute
a
decently
strong
bitterness
especially
for
the
style
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
subpar
maibock
one
i
dont
really
ever
want
to
revisit
drinkability
this
was
an
overall
easy
drinking
maibock
and
hits
the
spot
when
looking
for
a
malty
beer
the
flavors
were
close
to
a
traditional
maibock
but
something
went
wrong
and
there
are
flaws
in
the
beer
that
ruin
an
otherwise
decent
effort
in
flavor
combinations
not
one
i
think
ill
ever
try
again
i
mean
that
for
the
beer
and
the
brewery
d
not
my
1
style
in
the
beer
world
tend
towards
the
hoppybitter
stuff
overall
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
if
not
memorable
on
a
crisp
late
summer
but
falllike
night
this
still
hits
the
spot
pretty
well
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
more
of
these
but
i
could
just
as
easily
move
over
to
try
something
else
instead
md
feels
great
in
the
mouth
apart
from
the
alcohol
being
rather
strong
actually
it
seems
summit
did
not
try
to
mask
the
alcohol
at
all
the
drinkability
is
poor
i
would
say
summit
dropped
the
ball
on
this
one
ive
been
trying
some
maibocks
out
recently
and
this
one
is
really
pretty
solid
its
not
too
maibocky
its
got
a
lightness
and
crispness
to
it
its
a
tasty
beer
that
wont
change
your
life
or
blow
your
mind

the

the

old

maibock
first
smell
to
hit
the
nose
was
lightly
skunky
now
after
five
i
can
say
it
it
more
of
a
hoppiness
rather
than
a
skunkiness
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
maltiness
but
not
bad
hops
are
unique
overall
a
nice
rendition
of
a
maibock
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
when
grading
it
out
it
is
solid
across

an

bodied
and
smooth
taste
as
well
as
how
easy
it
was
to
sip
away
at
the
darker
bockdoppelbock
styles
but
this
is
the
first
maibock
ive
had
without
knowing
the
style
i
can
just
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
aroma
is
floral
and
lightly
nutty
with
a
mineral
quality
flavor
reveals
more
mineral
and
earthy
hops
with
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
and
a
slightly
sour
note
with
a
bitter
finish
expected
much
more
malt
character
the
sour
taste
is
offputting
maibock
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
with
einbecker
maiurbock
my
first
and
favorite
of
the
genre
this
one
is
close
but
not
quite
as
light
still
a
super
highquality
beer
for
those
who
know
quality
beer
is
more
about
malt
than
hops
poured
ontap
into
a
mug
pours
red
orange
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
slight
berries
tastes
of
slight
fruit
nice
malt
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
light
bodied
crisp
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
adam
from
tipped
mixology
overall
one
of
the
best
maibocks
ive
tried
and
ive
tried
many
i
love
this
style
and
this
one
is
a
perfect
example
of
it
well
balanced
with
big
flavors
and
a
good
abv
to
match
o
i
was
impressed
dark
flavorful
hoppy
with
fruity
notes
a
favorite
pours
a
nice
medium
amber
in
color
with
a
about
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
left
some
very
nice
spider
web
like
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
hops
with
no
skunky
smell
that
is
very
common
with
brews
in
green
bottle
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
very
smooth
actually
with
the
malts
and
hops
blended
nicely
with
a
very
light
hoppy
finish
which
wasnt
bad
and
didnt
linger
at
all
perfect
carbonation
goes
down
easy
sure
this
was
a
bit
strong
but
it
never
felt
it
and
the
old
saying
of
the
original
being
the
best
held
true
here
to
a
large
extent
the
dry
finish
ensured
that
the
flavors
lingered
nicely
for
a
while
and
this
had
a
pretty
easygoing
nature
to
it
like
a
good
maibock
should
great
for
this
time
of
the
year
or
for
anyone
unaccustomed
to
this
style
another
solid
offering
from
hofbrau
first
time
tasting
this
beer
thicker
than
hofbraü
original
but
still
very
good
definitely
more
hops
and
a
more
fully
bodied
taste
i
dont
know
if
its
better
than
original
but
still
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
would
buy
again
overall
better
and
stronger
than
original
hofbrau
the
noble
hops
are
stronger
but
so
are
the
malts
but
its
perfectly
balanced
has
a
nice
redamber
color
head
retention
is
great
lacing
is
good
smell
and
taste
are
excellent
i
would
buy
this
any
day
where
has
it
been
hiding
better
than
the
original
o
my
first
maibock
and
i
enjoyed
it
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
an
oktoberfest
mug
this
lager
is
an
orangeamber
color
with
some
offwhite
to
tan
foam
smells
exceeding
malty
with
caramel
toasty
and
nutty
elements
body
fairly
heavy
and
this
brew
is
quite
sweet
with
a
moderate
degree
of
carbonation
taste
is
very
maltforward
with
caramel
and
bread
crust
flavors
combining
with
the
buttery
mouthfeel
to
yield
a
waffles
and
dark
syrup
effect
quintessential
german
malt
there
is
also
a
fermented
honey
sweetness
and
the
hops
are
more
assertive
than
expected
herbal
and
minty
id
rate
the
flavor
higher
were
it
not
for
traces
of
a
metallic
skunked
flavor
due
to
the
packaging
i
feel
fortunate
though
this
example
must
have
been
protected
quite
well
from
light
as
the
skunk
was
a
minor
nuisance
than
did
not
ruin
the
entire
experience
i
can
imagine
than
this
would
be
sublime
on
tap
shitty
to
put
such
a
great
malt
showcase
in
a
green
bottle
bad
call
probably
based
on
marketing
but
do
not
be
dissuaded
from
trying
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
classic
german
sweet
malts
the
malts
are
plenty
assertive
but
the
hops
also
get
their
licks
in
well
done
first
thing
i
noticed
was
how
the
bitterness
in
this
doesnt
blend
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
ignoring
the
bitterness
the
yeast
also
has
a
strong
flavor
that
adds
to
the
sharpness
in
flavor
its
that
slight
sourness
i
get
from
certain
lagers
but
really
strong
in
this
one
the
very
toasty
breaded
malty
flavor
does
please
my
buds
not
a
great
beer
but
in
the
guidelines
for
style
a
pleasant
little
bock
beer
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
has
enough
malt
and
hop
goodness
tempered
with
a
mild
alcohol
background
that
things
just
seem
to
gel
into
one
delicious
lager
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
works
well
for
me
today
might
hurt
ya
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
were
to
session
this
but
one
or
two
would
treat
you
well
overall
a
great
beer
ive
certainly
had
maibocks
that
i
liked
better
but
its
a
nice
crisp
changeup
with
a
fuller
body
for
some
heft
o
i
like
the
full
amount
of
flavor
but
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
metalmineral
flavor
nice
and
refreshing
o
a
top
notch
brew
im
more
a
malt
and
yeast
than
hop
fan
and
this
one
made
me
a
fan
of
hofbrau
o
this
seems
to
be
a
decent
example
of
a
style
that
isnt
a
personal
favorite
but
one
that
im
trying
to
explore
however
this
one
is
more
sweet
than
it
should
be
for
style
especially
on
the
finish
still
not
altogether
unenjoyable
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
either
an
agreeable
enough
maibock
especially
considering
the
higher
than
average
abv
good
and
malty
fruity
and
not
overwhelmed
by
said
booze
unfortunately
given
the
strength
this
is
not
really
worthy
of
a
session
at
a
spare
wooden
table
as
it
were
tasty
and
satisfying
id
say
stop
overlooking
this
beer
this
is
a
good
robust
lager
that
i
enjoyed
but
hofbraus
green
bottles
plus
the
journey
to
the
us
dont
help
in
the
freshness
department
with
a
trip
to
germany
in
the
cards
for
sometime
next
year
this
is
one
beer
ill
be
looking
to
have
on
tap
o
simply
put
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
good
balance
flavor
and
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
and
the
hop
profile
lends
a
wide
array
of
different
flavors
o
this
beer
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
was
pretty
good
there
were
enough
hops
to
balance
out
the
finish
hofbräu
maibock
pours
a
clear
copper
color
a
halfinch
of
light
beige
head
tops
the
brew
and
settles
slowly
caramel
and
bready
malt
aromas
dominate
the
nose
as
lighter
hop
and
yeasty
aromas
provide
some
more
depth
bready
to
begin
with
sweeter
caramel
malt
flavors
move
in
with
hints
of
honey
and
nuts
swirling
into
a
slightly
hoppy
and
alcoholic
finish
this
classic
example
of
the
style
is
moderately
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
o
i
normally
reach
right
for
the
hefeweizen
at
a
german
brauhaus
but
since
this
was
inseason
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
im
glad
i
did
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
not
cloying
at
all
and
very
easy
to
get
carried
away
drinking
its
getting
warmer
which
means
its
maibock
time
folks
this
one
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
light
honey
and
a
decidedly
light
bit
of
dry
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
extra
helpings
of
grass
and
flowers
and
a
vague
fruitiness
pervading
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
maibock
one
of
the
base
staples
of
the
style
in
my
eyes
would
pick
this
up
again
glad
i
tried
it
rjt
overall
a
decent
beer
pretty
average
on
most
account
and
probably
nothing
i
would
go
back
to
i
havent
had
too
many
maibocks
but
i
would
imagine
thered
be
better
ones
out
there
than
this
i
have
no
experience
with
maibocks
but
to
me
this
tastes
comparable
to
an
oktoberfest
with
aboveaverage
bitterness
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
my
only
advice
is
to
try
and
drink
it
slower
than
i
did
good
body
medium
carbonation
creamy
had
this
on
tap
at
kaizerhof
in
yurakucho
tokyo
poured
into
a
glass
stein
whiskeyhued
clear
brew
with
a
beautiful
foamy
white
head
love
the
appearance
of
this
beer
roasted
hops
dominates
the
palate
in
this
brew
delicious
but
not
very
layered
in
flavors
or
smell
overall
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
but
not
exactly
a
complex
number
worth
talking
about
too
much
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
pours
a
pretty
clear
copper
with
a
large
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
smell
is
toasted
malt
with
a
little
herbal
and
grassy
hops
fairly
standard
taste
is
huge
toasted
malt
balanced
by
tons
of
hops
herbal
and
spicy
smooth
and
full
bodied
nicely
carbonated
great
mouthfeel
this
was
absolutely
great
on
tap
at
hofbrauhaus
in
pittsburgh
with
german
food
so
balanced
and
tasty
and
drinkable
this
is
also
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
nice
strong
hoppy
german
beer
for
spring
time
flavor
is
malty
with
caramel
and
toffee
but
i
do
get
a
bit
of
spicy
and
wet
grass
hops
on
the
finish
the
beer
actually
finishes
dry
and
with
just
a
little
bite
which
i
didnt
anticipate
from
the
nose
no
real
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
very
easy
drinking
clean
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
to
get
excited
over
but
certainly
enjoyable
and
not
flawed
o
this
is
definitely
a
staple
for
maibocks
having
no
real
weaknesses
and
is
just
a
solid
allaround
good
beer
it
packs
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
yet
is
still
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
especially
on
this
cool
early
spring
day
without
a
doubt
this
is
a
brew
that
ill
be
enjoying
again
during
next
years
spring
season
enjoyed
at
the
east
side
restaurant
in
new
britain
connecticut
this
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
cover
and
hearty
lacing
the
aroma
is
deep
nutty
malt
and
woodsy
wheat
very
definitive
and
tasty
the
flavor
brings
out
more
delicious
malt
grain
with
a
herbal
hop
kiss
this
is
earthy
stuff
with
a
beautiful
sweet
molasses
theme
that
is
easy
drinking
in
this
medium
bodied
brew
carbonation
is
relatively
modest
but
it
has
a
smooth
feel
that
ends
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
this
is
a
wonderful
malt
flavorfest
very
enjoyable
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
that
is
surprisingly
sessionable
however
its
high
abv
makes
it
unwise
to
do
so
understandably
it
is
not
a
beer
you
should
consume
in
a
sequence
overall
this
was
good
and
is
worth
trying
but
just
a
tad
bit
too
sweet
for
me
anyone
into
sweet
malt
and
bready
flavor
will
love
this
brew
o
overall
its
great
id
love
to
try
it
at
the
hb
haus
on
draft
overall
all
pretty
good
this
one
was
thin
on
flavor
at
times
though
the
hops
seemed
rough
and
didnt
seem
to
pair
with
the
rest
of
the
components
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
when
will
the
euros
finally
realize
americans
arent
fooled
by
the
exotic
green
bottles
anymore
notes
dam
good
inside
and
out
a
pleasant
dryness
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
and
some
burnt
caramel
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
memorable
im
finding
some
good
things
to
appreciate
in
this
beer
im
glad
i
pick
up
a
bottle
though
it
might
not
be
the
freshest
worth
a
shot
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
its
insanely
drinkable
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
to
it
over
and
over
want
a
tasty
maibock
to
celebrate
the
spring
or
acknowledge
your
german
heritage
this
is
a
really
good
one
its
not
extreme
its
just
a
good
strong
substantial
brew
nice
a
classic
german
maibock
this
one
pours
a
nice
amber
to
indian
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
head
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smells
very
german
malty
sweet
but
light
perfect
for
spring
flavor
is
definitely
malt
driven
with
some
caramel
undertones
and
a
mild
tartness
at
the
end
feel
isnt
bad
a
little
flat
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
beer
suffers
from
green
bottle
syndrome
but
who
knows
lighter
and
very
drinkable
despite
its
hefty
alcohol
content
even
though
this
is
the
standard
i
like
a
lot
of
the
american
maibocks
better
from
a
mouthfeel
standpoint
overall
a
looking
forward
to
have
this
again
overall
its
a
little
more
tolerable
and
i
could
do
worse
but
i
am
done
with
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
ring
of
lacing
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
and
biscuits
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
there
is
a
lot
of
complex
malty
characters
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
maibock
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
overall
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
beer
too
much
butter
and
not
enough
bitterness
i
will
say
that
the
six
pack
i
bought
was
marked
way
down
and
is
probably
from
last
year
but
nonetheless
it
wasnt
too
great
o
hofbraus
maibock
was
a
good
beer
for
the
style
that
i
could
only
imagine
would
have
been
a
lot
better
if
wasnt
slightly
skunked
due
to
the
stupid
decision
of
putting
it
in
a
green
bottle
even
in
the
green
bottle
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
would
love
to
try
on
draft
or
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
brown
bottle
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
recommended
o
the
darkest
and
maltiest
maibock
i
have
had
its
a
tasty
malty
brew
the
majority
of
beers
in
this
style
i
have
had
before
are
paler
and
drier
in
the
finish
with
not
such
a
strong
malt
presence
i
definitely
prefer
this
flavour
profile
its
more
like
a
normal
bock
satisfying
malt
backbone
with
a
lager
clean
finish
too
easy
to
drink
prost
overall
this
has
the
makings
of
a
great
beer
cant
say
ive
tasted
a
lot
of
maibocks
but
from
what
i
can
read
this
one
is
spot
on
yick
green
bottles
and
the
singles
rack
at
kroger
and
i
knew
better
too
d
great
beer
i
cant
imagine
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
from
the
source
hopefully
ill
find
out
one
day
reco
p
stellar
pairing
with
bratwurst
served
with
a
sweet
onion
sauce
i
gave
in
and
tried
another
one
of
these
and
this
one
wasnt
skunked
and
it
is
a
much
better
beer
my
initial
review
isnt
bad
but
this
is
definitely
better
a
nice
caramel
toffee
flavor
with
a
bitter
after
taste
hopefully
they
change
the
bottle
id
change
taste
on
this
to
45
but
im
going
to
leave
it
for
now
o
what
a
great
wellcrafted
clean
beer
after
being
immersed
in
the
world
of
crazy
american
craft
brew
experimentation
sometimes
its
just
nice
to
appreciate
something
that
the
majority
of
people
would
think
of
as
beer
just
plain
beer
but
so
well
done
i
must
reitterate
if
you
see
this
on
tap
buy
a
big
stein
it
is
a
whole
different
beer
but
i
expect
hb
to
get
with
modern
bottle
engineering
with
a
date
o
refreshing
and
really
drinkable
beer
the
honey
flavor
really
shines
and
brings
the
other
flavors
together
german
bock
the
best
beer
makers
making
one
of
the
best
beers
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
overall
sort
of
disappointed
in
this
one
also
made
me
think
about
something
why
do
breweries
even
bother
putting
their
beer
in
green
bottles
anyways
everytime
i
have
sampled
something
from
a
green
bottle
it
comes
out
skunked
without
fail
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
or
on
tap
as
this
beverage
was
clearly
affected
by
being
lightstruck
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
i
wouldnt
reccommend
starting
with
this
one
a
rich
caramel
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
has
nice
sea
foam
lacing
i
may
have
a
better
review
than
most
since
i
got
it
from
a
fresh
tap
at
the
hofbrau
house
in
panama
city
instead
of
a
green
bottle
sweet
caramel
and
honey
notes
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
herbal
earthy
noble
hops
the
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
with
rich
caramel
honey
and
toffee
notes
followed
with
an
earthy
herbal
grassy
hop
back
bite
very
well
balanced
my
favorite
of
the
hofbrrau
family
i
tried
very
easy
to
drink
even
on
the
sweet
side
less
watery
than
their
other
selections
very
easy
to
drink
slightly
syrupy
but
well
balanced
medium
bodied
beer
i
suspect
this
keg
didnt
make
the
journey
halfway
around
the
world
with
all
its
goodness
intact
though
it
was
easy
to
put
away
a
pint
of
this
beer
the
hofbrauhaus
maibock
is
richly
flavoreda
mixture
of
sweetness
and
malt
that
lingers
with
additional
flavors
that
cut
through
to
prevent
the
sweetness
from
becoming
cloying
the
color
as
seen
through
a
liter
mug
is
like
that
of
goldenrod
honeydarker
and
more
orange
than
clover
i
can
imagine
that
there
might
be
better
maibocks
but
ive
never
had
one
and
even
if
i
do
it
wont
displace
this
one
from
my
memory
hofbräu
maibock
not
only
provides
a
definition
of
the
style
thats
worthy
of
websters
but
it
is
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
you
serve
to
people
who
think
lagers
are
a
boring
waste
of
time
it
is
tremendously
rich
subtly
complex
deceivingly
quaffable
and
brewed
with
a
stringent
level
of
attention
to
pertinent
detail
that
really
only
the
germans
are
capable
of
its
decent
as
far
as
style
is
concerned
but
not
really
a
masterful
palate
the
beer
just
doesnt
really
interest
or
impress
me
ahh
there
we
go
nice
nutty
character
with
a
good
dose
of
earthy
bittering
noble
hops
drying
things
out
quickly
on
the
finish
toffee
and
caramel
stale
bread
flint
slate
light
acidity
walnut
and
brown
sugar
carbonation
is
lively
in
the
middle
leaving
the
palate
at
attention
through
the
finish
overall
quite
ok
sessionable
but
the
boozy
finish
will
be
a
constant
reminder
of
how
a
session
is
going
heavier
than
most
american
beers
of
the
style
but
by
no
means
heavy
super
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
lovely
stuff
the
beer
is
transparent
and
light
orange
colored
with
a
small
white
head
pockets
of
carbonation
are
visible
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
smells
of
a
sweet
lager
with
hints
of
fruit
the
beer
has
a
mild
earthiness
about
it
the
flavor
brings
a
distinctive
german
lager
character
with
light
fruit
and
a
present
sweetness
one
is
plenty
for
me
as
the
sweetness
slowly
becomes
cloying
a
decent
brew
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
would
have
it
again
round
flavorfeel
of
an
ale
reminds
me
of
a
scotch
ale
lots
of
caramel
but
the
swallow
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
notable
hop
spice
interestingly
the
aftertaste
is
sweetness
brown
sugary
very
rich
body
almost
like
whole
milk
carbonation
is
also
above
average
making
this
a
great
mouthfeel
overall
one
of
the
nicest
bocks
ive
ever
had
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
smells
of
light
sweet
malts
taste
is
starts
with
sweet
malts
then
i
get
a
bit
of
hoppiness
as
it
gets
farther
back
on
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
just
where
it
should
be
in
my
opinion
if
you
dont
notice
the
mouthfeel
its
just
right
overall
this
is
a
dang
good
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
would
jump
at
a
chance
to
buy
it
again
pours
a
twofinger

peabody
ma
this
bottled
version
is
good
but
the
hb
maibock
was
far
better
ontap
in
munich
zum
wohl
beer
is
heavier
in
body
that
i
expected
but
tastes
nice
the
beer
leads
off
with
this
mild
sweetness
and
a
bitterness
on
the
end
with
a
mildly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
flavor
is
nice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
slightly
heavier
maltier
lager
thats
highly
drinkable
here
you
go
id
have
it
again
highly
recommended
o
a
decent
bock
that
could
use
some
more
malt
complexity
but
is
pleasant
and
a
nice
afternoon
treat
as
long
as
the
abv
doesnt
catch
up
with
you
overall
not
the
best
maibock
i
have
ever
had
but
still
quality
and
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
i
reccomend
this
gem
as
a
go
to
example
of
the
style
buy
it
by
the
case
notes
the
first
few
sips
are
heavy
on
the
mineral
notes
and
are
bit
distracting
luckily
this
fades
somewhat
as
it
warms
and
more
of
the
sweetness
comes
out
overall
i
would
call
this
a
good
average
maibock
o
a
very
refreshing
and
unexpected
splash
of
flavor
highly
enjoyable
and
a
nice
style

a
nice
light
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
nice
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
for
the
most
part
the
beer
is
mostly
transparent
with
a
slight
cloudiness
and
a
very
large
amount
carbonation
bubbles
which
can
be
seen
bubbling
through
the
beer
from
the
bottom
up
these
carbonation
bubbles
help
to
maintain
the
small
amount
of
head
that
lingers
at
the
top
of
the
brew
there
is
very
little
lacing
residual
foam
left
on
the
glass
with
this
beer
which
as
i
understand
it
is
typical
of
the
style
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
overall
scent
of
a
nice
sweetness
possibly
similar
to
dark
fruits
and
a
very
slight
molasses
note
this
brew
has
a
very
pleasant
taste
with
an
initial
underlying
sweetness
similar
to
grapes
and
a
nice
deep
malty
finish
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
palate
the
hofbrau
maibock
although
it
is
7
2
seems
to
have
absolutely
no
alcohol
burn
which
really
makes
it
easy
to
drink
the
deepness
of
the
brew
really
helps
the
overall
taste
but
does
hurt
how
easily
it
drinks
overall
i
found
it
to
have
a
simple
taste
smoothness
on
the
palate
and
nice
depth
d
very
good
drinkability
i
am
still
playing
with
the
taste
and
want
to
find
out
more
very
nice
and
refreshing
one
their
hoppy
zestiness
is
right
on
the
money
style
but
you
dont
lose
the
maltiness
or
breadniess
on
the
tongue
glad
this
one
comes
in
6
packs
fantastic
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
classic
big
bock
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
that
is
slightly
hazed
off
white

with
good
retention
and
some
good

loads
of
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of

taste
is
malty
with
some
light
fruits
lingering
in
the
background
a
slight
yeast
character
is
present
as
well
body
and
carbonation
are
a
little
off
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
good
beer
shouldnt
be
offputting
to
anyone
that
drinks
it
i
would
score
this
higher
but
i
think
the
beer
is
lacking
pizazz
a
definite
step
up
from
bmc
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
flavor
and
substance
that
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
it
has
a
pretty
good
drinkability
for
being
7
2abv
it
has
some
nice
crisp
lager
flavors
but
a
little
sweet
as
well
and
just
a
hint
of
warming
booze
hofbräu
maibock
hit
the
spot
after
a
long
bike
ride
on
a
cool
latesummer
day
although
not
complex
or
overlymemorable
it
is
sweet
but
not
syrupy
and
has
a
great
finish
i
grabbed
one
of
these
in
a
mixed
six
pack
the
other
day
at
martys
in
newton
the
color
on
this
brew
is
a
dark
orange
almost
amber
with
a
large
crown
of
frothy
white
head
musty
nose
brings
forth
butterscotch
fresh
grains
brown
bread
and
something
almost
egg
like
taste
is
full
of
flavors
such
as
white
cake
herbs
and
floral
notes
more
fresh
grain
etc
the
mouthfeel
is
much
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
which
jacks
up
the
drinkability
by
a
notch
or
two
although
this
tastes
like
a
sessionable
maibock
the
alcohol
that
is
listed
makes
me
think
otherwise
i
love
big
lagers
like
this
one
well
done
d
decently
refreshing
and
quaffable

surprised

the
experience

it
has
a
very
smooth
and
slightly
hopy
slightly
spicey
taste

flavors
werent
too
strong
but
still
very
present
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
easily
drink
another

i
found
it
a
good
beer

just
enjoyable

with

i
liked
the
aroma
but
im
not
sold
on
this
beer
based
on
the
flavour
its
not
that
i
didnt
enjoy
it
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
expected
to
based
on
the
smells
i
picked
up
initially
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
high
in
abv
it
would
be
excellent
in
terms
of
drinkability
especially
for
a
malt
lover
however
it
does
truly
limit
you
this
is
an
excellent
offering
from
hofbräu
who
usually
make
good
beers
worth
trying
in
early
spring
when
youre
tired
of
roasted
and
spiced
winter
beers
but
its
still
too
cold
out
to
break
out
the
golden
lemon
fizzy
stuff
drinkability
a
nice
malt
bomb
that
that
the
characteristics
i
associate
with
german
brews
i
could
have
two
or
three
a
sipper
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
probably
buy
more
in
my
next
stop
once
again
the
germans
do
it
right
drinkability
good
hofbrau
produces
a
good
range
of
tasty
beers
and
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
imported
by
hofbrauhaus
of
america
vasser
mi
d
great
flavors
from
this
maibock
and
one
id
like
to
drink
a
few
of
its
crisp
yet
refreshing
with
no
off
flavors
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
from
the
hofbräuhaus
that
includes
the
fresh
drafts
brewed
in
pittsburgh
and
the
imported
bottles
from
germany
i
have
to
say
every
hofbräuhaus
beer
is
infinitely
better
from
a
fresh
keg
than
it
is
bottled
and
this
beer
is
definitely
not
an
exception
to
that
rule
not
the
best
maibock
ive
ever
had
and
surely
much
better
tapped
at
the
source
but
one
that
i
would
always
welcome
in
my
glass
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
fresh
and
flavorful
these
go
down
very
easy
the
abv
is
not
detectable
at
all
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
consume
and
highly
sessionable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
from
the
taste
o
at
first
i
really
liked
but
but
the
hop
flavor
seemed
off
on
the
finish
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
damn
good
if
you
come
across
this
pick
it
up
some
basic
staple
german
brews
i
feel
like
they
still
have
that
macro
lager
taste
where
the
carbonation
is
alil
to
much
but
not
this
one
a
truely
solid
brew
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
maibock
i
bekieve
this
is
the
first
maibock
i
have
ever
tryed
it
had
a
nice
deep
coppec
color
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
guickly
a
very
malty
nose
that
lasted
right
to
the
tounge
with
a
touch
of
noble
hops
in
the
back
ground
a
heavy
carmal
sweatness
that
stayed
on
the
tounge
for
a
long
time
a
very
relaxing
beer
that
i
woll
by
agian
drinkability
this
style
is
quickly
becoming
a
personal
fav
and
this
beer
is
one
if
not
the
best
i
have
had
i
had
this
brew
in
a
hofbrau
haus
in
the
states
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
deep
cooper
color
and
crystal
clear
but
overall
the
flavor
isnt
as
nice
as
the
color
it
lacks
aroma
but
is
true
to
the
style
with
very
little
hops
and
lots
of
caramel
you
can
feel
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
and
the
finish
is
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
endeavor
for
those
looking
for
something
more
than
pale
lager
however
it
wont
inspire
those
that
are
used
to
bolder
flavors
d
i
could
sip
this
all
day
if
i
had
the
time
love
it
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
easily
have
another
beer
is
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
mostly
of
roasted
nuts
the
taste
was
sweet
but
clean
the
feel
was
a
creamy
smooth
and
went
down
way
too
easy
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
too
many
due
to
the
higher
abv
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
with
about
an
inch
of
head
light
tanamber
color
scents
of
roasted
nuts
malty
breadlike
biscuits
amazing
tastes
sweet
smooth
lager
some
dry
white
bread
flavors
malts
and
sweet
caramel
nutty
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
be
careful
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
on
tap
the
hofbräu
maibock
is
not
to
be
missed
and
offers
a
great
degree
of
complexity
and
liveness
from
the
bottle
i
found
this
beer
to
be
much
less
complex
in
aroma
and
flavor
an
a
touch
less
sweet
yum
goes
down
smooth
hints
of
alcohol
dont
come
in
the
way
of
a
pretty
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
wellbalanced
between
the
herbal
spicy
hops
and
the
sweet
malt
d
great
drinkability
as
a
session
beer
enjoyable
and
a
great
spring
beer
recommended
herbal
looks
like
spring
sunshine
in
a
glass
perfect
beer
for
spring
or
summer
slightly
sweet
but
not
overwhelming
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
hints
of
malt
nuttiness
lemon
and
herbs
would
definitely
buy
again
pair
this
with

very
good
dark

not
a

the
flavor
is
excellent
a
great
way
to
ease
into
the
lighter
german
beers
of
summer
notes
great
strong
malty
sweet
brew
a
just
enough
spicy
hops
for
character
its
a
good
beer
sweet
without
being
overpowering
d
a
really
nice
beer
and
another
score
for
hofbrau
great
to
pair
with
spicy
or
gravyladen
dishes
and
quite
satisfying
on
its
own
the
alcohol
might
get
to
your
head
quickly
if
you
keep
up
with
them
but
its
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
anyway
right
pours

smells
of
hops

the
style
of
a

feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
yeast
sweet
malt
and
pale
malt
overall
a
totally
different
beer
on
draft
than
in
bottle
very
tasty
d
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
weizens
and
festbiers
that
dominated
my
drinking
on
this
trip
the
slight
warmth
made
for
good
contrast
to
a
cool
late
summer
evening
of
the
hofbrau
beers
ive
had
this
is
easily
my
favorite
overall
wow
my
first
maibock
ever
and
im
hooked
this
is
alot
lighter
than
your
average
dopple
my
favorite
part
is
the
overall
refreshing
qualities
this
beer
has
i
can
see
how
this
bock
was
made
for
the
spring
season
everything
in
great
balance
here
without
sacrificing
any
complexity
overall
the
quick
disappearance
of
the
head
is
the
main
fault
of
hofbräu
maibock
this
is
not
the
sort
of
beer
you
should
introduce
to
inexperienced
drinkers
but
enthusiasts
will
certainly
find
it
enjoyable
mouthfeeldrinkability
slick
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
gentle
prickle
is
outstanding
and
the
highlight
of
this
beers
review
if
i
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
again
it
will
be
with
a
traditional
german
breakfast
or
lunch
of
bratwurst
with
potato
pancakes
a
lovely
beer
too
strong
for
more
than
one
500ml
bottle
at
a
time
but
i
would
definitely
cough
up
the
to
drink
this
again
d
the
higher
alcohol
makes
this
a
little
harder
to
drink
than
others
in
the
style
but
still
fairly
drinkable
hofbrau
maibock
poured
a
nice
amber
color
but
had
no
head
what
so
ever
and
just
ok
lacing
the
smell
was
nice
with
caramel
and
hints
of
hops
on
lighter
side
which
lost
it
some
points
taste
was
very
nice
filled
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
and
very
nice
hop
back
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
sticky
side
but
was
ok
drinkability
was
nice
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
12oz
green
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
clear
copper
with
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
rich
malty
aroma
not
really
caramel
but
that
distinctive
german
malt
aroma
also
some
faint
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
not
as
malty
as
the
aroma
might
suggest
but
there
is
a
good
malt
base
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
not
sweet
at
all
for
all
the
malt
actually
finishes
fairly
dry
very
drinkable
to
me
nice
bock
i
picked
this
up
in
one
of
the
pa
distributors
yeah
pathe
state
with
the
fcked
up
case
law
near
my
job
i
got
it
just
as
the
german
season
for
drinking
it
is
coming
to
a
close
but
i
feel
i
got
there
in
time
just
before
the
helles
lagers
take
over
for
summer
d
very
drinkable
lives
up
to
the
hofbrau
standard
good
example
of
the
style
d
a
satisfying
brew
malty
and
quite
hoppy
like
a
german
ipa
if
you
will
big
grain
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
is
awesome
but
something
just
gets
out
of
whack
with
the
mf
for
me
however
it
is
nice
to
have
a
traditional
maibock
wish
i
could
find
one
from
the
super
bestest
brewery
ayinger
poured
a
12
oz
green
why
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
high
but
shortlived
offwhite
head
on
top
of
a
goldenorange
brew
aroma
of
freshbaked
sweet
bread
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
is
all
about
a
freshgrain
malty
goodness
a
nutty
melanoiding
flavor
is
present
with
just
enough
alcohol
and
background
hop
bitterness
to
keep
the
finish
on
the
dry
side
seems
to
be
medium
bodied
though
it
probably
comes
in
a
little
heavier
than
it
seems
all
in
all
a
dangerously
sessionable
beer
that
shouldnt
be
sessioned
i
was
thinking
this
deserved
to
be
listed
as
an
exemplar
of
the
style
by
bjcp
and
it
is
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
maibock
another
quality
brew
from
hofbrau
that
id
like
to
try
fresh
on
tap
in
germany
looks
the
color
of
tea
with
a
short
quickly
fading
beige
head
and
almost
no
lace
to
speak
of
sweet
aromas
of
sugar
and
caramel
candy
sweet
toasted
malt
touch
of
caramel
hint
of
fruit
maybe
raisin
sweet
tea
middle
ending
with
a
slightly
bitter
tea
medium
body
and
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
very
easy
beer
to
drink
hides
the
7
20
abv
very
well
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
very
quickly
so
far
i
have
had
three
styles
of
beer
from
hofbrau
and
all
have
been
above
average
beers
edit
ive
had
the
bottled
maibock
and
im
still
not
sure
its
the
same
beer
maybe
its
similar
but
the
draft
version
is
more
of
a
malt
bomb
while
the
bottled
version
is
hoppier
their
dunkel
is
the
same
way
but
with
this
brew
the
difference
is
a
mile
wide
on
tap
this
is
an
absolute
delight
and
one
of
my
munich
favorites
from
a
bottle
its
soso
had
this
on
tap
at
he
breezy
point
inn
on
greenwood
lake
poured
into
its
branded
20oz
tall
fluted
glass
one
finger
head
dwindled
quickly
and
left
some
good
lacing
patterns
down
the
glass
color
kind
of
amberbrown
a
malty
aroma
comes
up
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
taste
is
smooooth
with
a
creamy
bockiness
that
paired
nicely
with
my
steak
and
potatoes
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
had
another
d
wow
damn
good
exemplary
for
the
style
the
taste
is
similar
rich
dark
raisiny
alcohol
and
spiciness
rich
sweet
toasted
bread
leaves
faintly
tealike
dried
fruit
it
has
nice
full
sweetness
with
a
light
spiceyleafy
bitterness
and
driedfruit
spiciness
the
elements
balance
nicely
and
last
maintaining
lasting
character
and
it
has
a
full
frothy
feel
a
very
enjoyable
maibock
with
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
recommended
has
a
slightly
spicy
sweet
smell
very
inviting
taste
starts
off
with
a
malty
sweetness
that
is
very
rapidly
taken
over
by
a
hoppy
sharpness
and
finishes
dry
the
sweet
malt
flavor
is
there
but
isnt
as
strong
or
as
persistent
as
other
bocks
i
have
been
trying
lately
i
like
it
and
feel
it
is
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
d
not
bad
but
dangerous
at
7
2
the
syrupiness
could
wear
heavy
after
more
than
a
couple
overall
nice
and
sweet
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
though
another
good
spring
beer
soft
but
ample
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
nice
feel
a
great
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
quite
a
wonderful
beer
the
heft
of
the
malt
and
cleanliness
of
the
finish
would
pair
well
with
flavorful
pork
dishes
why
not
have
some
with
your
easter
ham
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
but
a
thin
ring
within
seconds
of
the
pour
rich
malts
in
the
nose
husky
with
a
hint
of
a
fruity
hop
character
good
balance
in
flavor
rich
semi
sweet
malts
right
away
coat
and
linger
in
the
mouth
a
brighting
hop
bite
appears
just
before
the
finish
and
hangs
out
long
into
the
aftertaste
toffee
a
little
nutty
and
a
small
hint
of
chocolate
good
malt
structure
here
no
doubt
this
is
by
far
the
best
bottled
beer
ive
had
to
date
from
hofbräu
outstanding
drinkability
im
having
a
hard
time
believing
that
this
is
7
2
lightmedium
in
body
a
bit
sticky
mild
carbonation
good
beer
almost
sessionable
i
think
the
sweetness
would
become
cloying
after
a
few
d
meh
nothing
unpleasant
here
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
quite
impressed
with
this
very
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
very
solid
and
drinkable
maibock
straightahead
with
no
real
surprises
good
for
cooling
day
outside
late
fall
or
early
spring
refreshing
fairly
clean
with
well
hidden
alcohol
good
drinkability
i
wish
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
like
the
nose
i
wanted
the
big
malts
on
my
tongue
instead
of
the
off
flavors
that
interfered
with
the
caramel
malts
other
than
that
this
beer
is
light
and
has
some
decent
maltiness
drinkability
is
particularly
through
the
roof
considering
the
just
read
it
and
am
astounded
7
2
is
that
correct
d
very
tasty
balance
easy
going
down
nuff
said
im
giving
this
beer
a
fairly
high
score
because
it
is
just
so
exceptionally
brewed
it
hits
every
note
its
supposed
to
without
having
a
single
off
node
its
simultaneously
light
and
heavy
crisp
and
airy
but
still
complex
and
flavorful
its
like
a
good
one
act
play
one
thats
about
a
clown
or
a
dog
or
something
not
a
writer
or
a
woman
who
was
just
raped
you
think
uhh
this
is
gonna
be
too
much
right
now
why
didnt
i
just
stay
home
and
watch
tv
but
then
you
laugh
your
ass
off
and
dont
get
too
emotionally
involved
but
still
when
its
over
youre
sad
youve
been
affected
it
had
a
message
and
you
received
it
thats
what
this
beer
is
like
fairly
light
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
approaches
the
lighter
side
ridiculously
drinkable
given
the
firm
alcohol
content
one
of
the
better
maibocks
ive
had
and
follows
the
german
tradition
closely
recommended
with
general
german
dishes
the
spicing
should
allow
this
beer
to
hold
up
to
the
more
assertive
dishes
as
well
the
taste
was
toasted
caramel
low
carbonation
sweet
malts
some
hop
in
the
finish
very
enjoyable
very
smooth
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
a
very
traditional
brewhouse
in
germany
lchaim
a
complex
nice
drinking
lager
would
consider
buying
again
d
a
nice
fruity
drink
for
the
hot
summer
weather
recommended
regular
hofbräu
is
my
regular
beer
but
i
do
like
darker
stuff
also
so
i
was
glad
my
local
bevmax
started
getting
this
beer
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
d
i
can
drink
this
you
cant
notice
any
alcohol
and
it
is
very
clean
and
crisp
this
is
a
lovely
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
of
doughy
malt
and
caramel
a
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
honey
flavors
there
is
a
big
doughy
malt
that
runs
throughout
and
ends
with
a
slight
grape
note
along
with
a
small
spicy
hop
to
balance
out
the
feel
is
moderate
with
perfect
carbonation
fairly
balanced
leaning
towards
the
sweet
end
this
maibock
drinks
very
well
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
7
2abv
as
you
cant
detect
it
drinkability
very
nice
and
also
very
crisp
and
clean
you
coould
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
be
content
very
nice
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
good
beer
notes
this
was
not
an
incredible
experiencebut
i
buy
it
when
i
see
it
it
is
seasonal
for
the
spring
and
it
has
its
merits
not
too
strong
despite
the
abvlight
and
smooth
this
is
a
truly
super
beer
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
it
was
tasty
enough
to
easily
enjoy
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
i
really
enjoyed
the
fruit
aspect
of
this
beer
a
definite
malt
experience
but
the
hops
are
strong
enough
to
offer
balance
and
a
pleasant
dry
spicy
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
lowers
the
drinkability
a
bit
good
full
mouthfeel
pretty
nice
d
not
feeling
this
beer
thats
all
ive
got
to
say
d
the
somewhat
hot
alcohol
flavor
combines
in
an
unfortunate
way
with
the
harsh
hop
bitterness
to
create
an
unpleasant
taste
that
overwhelms
the
malt
characteristics
not
particularly
drinkable
d
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
enough
oomph
to
show
it
has
some
attitude
but
rather
easy
for
the
style
hofbräu
maibock
is
a
bit
spicy
and
bitter
but
is
quite
tasty
the
flavor
is
mostly
biscuit
with
tartness
like
grapefruit
after
reading
that
this
beer
is
a
spring
release
maibock
duh
and
i
bought
this
in
mid
february
doesnt
sound
good
also
at
the
lhbs
this
green
bottle
was
stored
directly
under
the
lighting
but
alas
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
amberorange
color
with
a
fine
bubbly
onefinger
head
the
smell
is
malty
sweet
slight
fruitiness
and
obvious
skunking
which
i
had
expected
from
above
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
malty
backbone
slightly
toasted
very
skunked
and
no
perceivable
hop
flavor
but
there
is
some
perceived
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
minimal
amount
of
mouthtingling
carbonation
drinkability
is
still
relatively
decent
because
of
the
light
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
but
that
doesnt
make
it
desirable
i
would
love
to
try
this
a
little
fresher
im
sure
its
much
much
better
also
for
7
2
its
not
really
very
noticeable
even
in
full
skunk
form
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
glass
it
pours
a
light
reddish
amber
with
a
modest
but
consistent
head
very
light
malt
aroma
with
some
grassy
hops
lurking
at
the
edge
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
and
disappointing
even
for
a
maibock
the
malt
is
fairly
light
on
the
palate
more
bitterness
might
make
things
a
bit
more
interesting
does
have
a
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
nice
balance
of
taste
and
gentle
carbonation
makes
for
easy
consumption
i
would
drink
several
of
these
at
any
one
sitting
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
a
well
balanced
beer
that
shows
off
both
malt
and
hop
drinkability
fairly
quaffable
sessionable
surprising
to
see
its
so
high
in
alcohol
taste
is
very
malty
and
pretty
bitter
more
bitter
than
i
expected
the
malt
is
biscuity
and
light
caramellic
again
the
yeast
gives
this
beer
such
a
great
extra
boost
of
balance
every
sip
is
enjoyed
the
beer
is
a
bit
sticky
but
not
overly
sweet
drinkability
is
great
especially
for
its
72
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
it
is
seriously
malty
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
it
leaves
me
a
bit
wanting
for
some
floral
noble
hops
to
taste
i
am
not
saying
that
this
is
out
of
style
but
the
maibocks
that
i
am
used
to
making
i
normally
have
a
bit
more
flavor
hops
myself
but
i
am
not
advocating
that
a
maibock
be
hoppy
but
i
like
a
mild
floral
presence
to
compliment
the
malt
overall
a
good
maibockhelles
lager
tasty
and
substantial
worth
a
try
pours
copper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
with
a
hop
spiciness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
crisp
sweet
bready
maltiness
starts
things
off
the
middle
has
a
pleasant
hoppiness
to
it
that
combines
with
a
slight
fruitiness
the
finish
is
mildly
dry
with
some
alcohol
detected
toward
the
back
overall
all
this
was
a
really
solid
example
of
the
maibock
style
offered
from
hofbräu
i
have
yet
to
be
blown
away
by
a
beer
from
staatliches
hofbrauhaus
their
helles
lager
and
their
hefe
are
decent
im
sure
id
feel
differently
if
i
was
able
to
experience
it
fresh
from
the
tap
in
munchen
id
like
to
be
seated
in
the
beer
garden
please
its
such
a
nice
day
but
the
bottled
product
doesnt
meet
my
expectations
this
is
still
a
worthwhile
purchase
if
you
love
the
style
drinkability
very
nice
tasting
beer
but
a
tad
bit
heavy
not
a
session
beer
but
definitely
worth
trying
i
visited
germany
several
years
ago
during
the
summer
and
stopped
by
the
hofbrau
in
munich
but
this
beer
was
not
on
tap
however
i
also
visted
the
chinesischer
turm
which
also
had
hofbrau
beers
on
tap
what
really
surprised
me
is
that
the
ct
had
this
hofbrau
bock
beer
on
tap
in
my
broken
german
i
asked
if
the
bock
beer
was
the
maibock
the
server
told
me
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
beer
as
the
maibock
accordingly
i
will
go
ahead
and
review
this
beer
as
the
maibock
this
brew
was
incredible
it
had
all
of
the
german
maltiness
you
would
expect
in
a
german
bock
beer
it
was
soooo
drinkable
it
was
crazy
i
long
for
this
beer
back
in
the
states
but
i
doubt
well
ever
get
the
real
thing
drinkability
a
very
tasty
maibock
with
a
great
play
on
the
taste
buds
exellent
balance
and
multideminsional
flavor
this
is
a
good
beer
pure
and
simple
poured
this
from
a
bottle
into
a
conical
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
a
nice
amber
color
my
only
gripe
here
is
that
its
hard
to
get
a
good
head
on
the
beer
although
that
didnt
detract
a
lot
from
my
rating
smells
ranged
from
fruity
to
floral
which
matched
the
spring
characteristics
this
beer
is
supposed
to
have
and
theyre
right
this
beer
fits
right
in
for
drinking
in
may
i
had
this
relaxing
on
a
late
spring
day
in
hot
florida
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
the
real
draw
here
is
the
taste
which
was
really
good
in
my
opinion
some
people
have
likened
the
taste
to
warm
bread
which
i
tend
to
disagree
with
although
i
guess
i
can
see
where
they
get
it
from
there
is
some
bread
in
the
taste
but
it
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
hits
your
mouth
with
an
interesting
richness
and
just
slides
down
your
throat
leaving
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
the
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
content
will
slow
you
down
a
bit
i
had
3
in
one
sitting
and
was
really
feeling
it
after
but
in
a
really
good
way
ill
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
looking
to
unwind
after
a
long
hot
day
but
im
not
sure
ill
pick
it
up
again
anytime
soon
especially
out
of
season
dangerously
drinkable
balanced
very
well
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
2nd
edit
dont
know
if
the
keg
from
resis
was
different
somehow
but
2
tap
samples
ive
tried
since
then
havent
been
the
same
possibly
going
downhill
with
age
more
flat
and
bready
not
much

or

well

better
luck

around
10
a
sixer
for
me
i
do
love
this
time
of
year
appearance
was
a
nice
caramel
color
with
a
creamy
head
which
quickly
turned
to
nice
lace
the
smell
was
a
little
sweet
but
not
distracting
the
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
lightness
but
with
substance
its
great
to
drink
a
mai
bock
that
tastes
like
a
mai
bock
should
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
copper

a
creamy
12
inch

light
spots
of
lace
on
the

the
aroma
is
very
skunky

of
malt
coming
through
the
taste
is
a
little
better
light
sweet
malt
flavoring
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
alcohol
but
overall
an
uneasy
wheaty
taste
its
hard
to
describe
but
this
tastes
like
all
the
other
beers
that
ive
had
that
have
come
in
green
bottles
if
its
green
it
always
seems
to
have
a
very
skunky
smell
and
taste
maybe
im
just
not
used
to
the
styles
but
they
just
dont
do
it
for
me
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
small
fizzy

the
aroma
is

and
a

out
smooth
with
some
malt
and
finishes
with
a
long
slightly
bitter
hoppiness
lightmedium
body
with
a
good
dose
of
prickly
carbonation
on
the
tongue

this
is
a
slightly
better
than

did
not
blow
me
away

pale
amber

the
remained
is
a
thin
white

a
bit
over
carbonated

me
a

boozy

nice

maybe
too
drinkable

ill
have
another

get
more

though
gets
to
be

give
me

in

be
buying

up
for

is
similar
just
a
great
fresh
off
the

the
yeasty

finish
gets
a
touch

spicy
but
it
helped
me
restrain
from
drinking
this
too
fast
and
not
enjoying
it
completely
mouthfeel
is
the
best
ive
ever
had
for
a
maibock
big
robust
full
yet
creamy
sweetness
and
spice
with
a
dry
overall
feel
i
could
see
this
losing
a

when
translated
to
the

try
to
get
it
on

taste
pretty
clean

palate
the
color
and
the
flavor
make
me
think
about
ambrosia

a
medium
bodied
amber
malt
with
equally
medium
sugar
makes
me
think
of
a
lightly
glazed
carrot

okay
just
not

i
liked
this
marzen
better
than
others
ive
had
nicely
balances
between
solid
malt
profile
slight
hop
finish
clean
crisp
feeling
makes
this
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
sticky
somewhat
cloying
it
reduces
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
it
is
what
i
expect
from
a
maibock
and
it
is
a
nice
rich
delicious
beer
definitely
buying
more
and
soon
poured
an
orangerust
color
with
an
inchthick
offwhite
colored
head
the
surface
was
laiden
with
different
sized
bubbles
aromas
of
honey
alcohol
and
ripe
fruit
the
taste
was
sweet
with
strong
fruit
undertones
a
bitter
finish
with
a
creamy
and
refreshing
texture
a
bit
too
dry
and
overly
sweet
as
i
neared
the
bottom
of
my
glass
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
with
hints
of
spice
and
fruit
surrounding
a
sweet
alcoholenriched
core
from
what
i
have
read
it
pretty
much
defines
a
maibock
but
i
prefer
a
hoppier
beer
its
quality
and
i
enjoy
it
zum
wohl
mk
well
done
musings
a
nice
maibock
indeed
different
approach
than
others
with
the
over
the
top
malt
character
but
it
still
tends
to
be
highly
drinkable
an
interesting
but
not
totally
satisfying
example
of
the
style
medium
light
body
with
a
light
carbonation
effect
of
foaming
the
beer
in
the
mouth
letting
it
release
its
bouquet
of
flavors
easily
moderately
dry
finish
crisp
and
full
on
the
palate
this
comes
across
to
me
as
a
lighter
but
still
malty
and
hoppier
doppelbock
a
good
transition
from
the
doppels
i
was
drinking
earlier
in
spring
to
the
warmer
weather
beers
ill
be
drinking
shortly
medium
body
with
some
alcohol
and
low
carbonation
give
a
smooth
watery
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
nice
malt
flavor
its
worth
a
try
the
bloodhound
factor
an
unimpressed
benjie
left
the
brew
on
its
own
peaches
was
intrigued
with
the
odd
complexity
and
happily
comsumed
her
and
her
brothers
portion
drinkabilty
this
goes
done
with
some
difficulty
for
me
and
i
would
avoid
this
this
beer
poured
a
bright
clear
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
head
didnt
last
all
that
long
but
there
was
a
nice
display
of
champagne
bubbles
rising
to
renew
it
the
nose
is
dominated
by
caramel
malt
light
notes
of
toffee
come
across
in
the
middle
of
the
nose
the
finish
has
just
a
little
citrus
and
floral
hop
the
flavor
is
again
dominated
by
malt
caramel
toffee
and
figs
abound
throughout
the
entire
flavor
but
the
hops
show
through
more
of
just
a
mild
bitterness
than
anything
else
although
there
is
just
a
bit
of
mild
floral
hops
nice
smooth

extremely
drinkable

a
very
light
orangecopper

almost
bordering

was
exceptional
i
have
not
seen
a
beer
this
clear
smell
had
some
mild
floral
aroma
taste
had
some
slight
bitterness
to
it
taste
reminded
me
of
genesee
but
in
a
good
way
that
is
not
a
bust
on
this
beer
but
a
complement
i
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
carbonation
had
a
medium
body
feel
and
some
dryness
drinkability
was
pretty
good
but
not
great
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
half
liter
bottle
pours
a
soid
ambered
dark
tea
brown
color
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
falls
to
a
healthy
coat
over

clarity
is
excellent
and
a
moderate
cascade
of
bubbles
keeps
the
head
maintained
nose
is
nicely
rounded
with
melanoidan
toastyness
with
very
light
hints
of
raisin
and
a
very
light
butteryness
flavor
is
definately
more
raisiney
than
the
nose
toasty
notes
are
there
but
hidden
well
behind
the
raisin
there
is
almost
a
bit
to
the
fruityness
that
takes
a
little
away
from
this
one
there
is
also
a
touch
of
metallic
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
end
of
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
that
matches
well
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
fruity
and
not
enouth
of
the
toastyness
fruityness
is
more
in
line
with
one
of
the
bigger
members
of
the
bock
family
that
being
said
its
tasty
and
is
worth
a
look
enjoyable

german
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
was
an
authentic
representation
of
perhaps
the
worlds
oldest
seasonal
beer
the
taste
is
fantastic
great
balance
of
munich
malt
tempered
with
a
slight
hop
finnish
you
could
find
maibocks
with
thinner
mouthfeel
but
why
bother
hofbrau
probably
was
one
of
the
first
breweries
to
produce
maibock
and
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
better
versions
which
begs
the
question
why
is
this
the
first
time
ive
ever
seen
it
in
the
us
d
1

this
beer
is
a
really
good
value
too
i
completely
recommend
it
very
malty
then
hoppy
kickback
this
beer
has
to
be
what
dead
guy
ale
was
aiming
for
even
though
this
beer
is
quite
different
i
feel
that
the
hofbrau
was
a
little
smoother
though
has
a
little
more
kick
and
it
is
noticeable
but
an
excellent
brew
overall
meaty
body
rich
and
dark
nice
initial
head
fruity
esthery
malts
and
an
outstanding
maibock
i
recommend
this
beer
and
it
is
moderately
priced
16
9
ounce
bottle
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
it
would
be
even
better
without
the
alcoholic
blast
in
the
middle
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
not
as
overwhelming
as
a
dopplebock
might
be
but
quite
rich
and
satisfying
reccomended
somewhat
hard
to
finish
with
no
freshness
dating
i
have
no
idea
if
i
have
a
bad
example
or
im
just
not
privy
to
this
i
will
try
this
again
thought
as
everything
else
ive
had
from
this
brewery
has
been
basically
masterful
overall
impression
even
in
the
time
of
oktoberfest
this
is
a
tasty
beer
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable

i

that

at
a

in
my
mind
their
session
lager
and
ltd
01
are
better
beers
but
this
one
might
have
a
bigger
flavor
than
either
other
ones
its
still
quite
drinkable
goes
with
food
well
ill
probably
pick
this
up
again
sometime
in
the
future
d
i
like
the
idea
of
this
beer
a
brewery
showing
people
what
a
lager
can
be
this
is
a
good
beer
all
around
not
world
class
for
sure
but
enjoyable
after
a
long
day
of
work
overall
a
decent
beer
only
recommend
if
fan
of
the
style
for
me
one
and
done
as
better
beers
out
there
its
not
bad
but
just
doesnt
really
have
much
flavor
to
it
to
make
you
want
more
good
amber
lager
with
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
spicy
hops
the
beer
pours
a
light
orangeamber
color
a
shade
lighter
than
other
amber
lagers
that
ive
come
across
the
head
is
white
and
dissipates
fairly
rapidly
with
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
theres
a
pretty
good
malt
presence
although
it
isnt
terribly
interesting
light
caramel
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
hops
are
mildly
spicy
and
also
not
incredible
however
the
balance
is
good
and
the
aftertaste
is
also
quite
pleasant
there
is
some
alcohol
presence
its
stronger
than
your
average
lager
at
any
rate
its
a
good
beer
and
hopefully
other
american
breweries
will
take
note
and
release
more
different
lagers
overall
this
is
an
amazingly
easy
drinking
beer
i
am
really
liking
what
full
sail
is
doing
with
the
ltd
lager
series
i
can
easily
drink
more
of
this
looking
forward
to
trying
ltd
3
when
all
is
said
an
done
this
leaves
me
with
the
impression
of
high
end
malt
liquor
which
would
be
decent
for
warming
up
in
cool
months
and
only
really
palatable
in
small
doses
a
bottle
a
sitting
if
theyd
be
willing
to
tweak
this
into
more
of
a
maibock
theyd
have
a
winner
as
everything
else
is
in
place
for
that
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
overall
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
lots
of
rich
malty
cake
like
flavors
which
i
did
enjoy
not
a
strong
hop
presence
in
this
one
but
just
enough
to
make
a
decent
balance
and
leave
you
wanting
more
not
much
to
say
but
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
better
yet
its
priced
very
cheap

cheers
d
this
was
an
exceptional
lager
from
an
ale
brewery
i
really
liked
session
so
i
was
excited
for
this
beer
i
was
not
let
down
plenty
of
flavors
and
even
a
bit
of
hops
this
is
the
way
a
lager
should
taste
it
is
right
up
there
in
the
same
category
as
brooklyn
lager
and
other
greats
i
will
buy
this
again
and
again
if
i
can
find
it
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
and
slightly
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
finish
is
light
and
crisp
there
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
with
a
good
flavor
the
head
has
some
retention
and
left
lacing
on
the
glass
very
drinkable
carb
is
just
right
a
very
good
lager
from
a
brewery
that
continues
to
astonish
after
many
many
years
not
a
lager
man
here
but
this
must
top
most
of
the
lagers
in
the
market
place
right
d
highly
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
full
sail
definitely
knows
how
to
make
an
awesome
lager
this
and
session
are
tough
to
beat
d
i
initially
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
but
the
date
ended
quickly
good
flavor
on
this
lager
with
an
amber
malt
profile
that
suggests
caramel
biscuit
and
a
toasted
nuttiness
thankfully
the
hops
are
much
more
evident
in
the
flavor
than
they
were
in
the
aroma
as
a
spicy
punch
of
saaz
gets
delivered
the
back
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
with
a
refreshing
and
crisp
finish

is

which
im
glad
i
purchased
a
sixer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
seidel
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
small
but
dense
cap
of

foam
aroma
is
tangy
and
malty
toasty
and
orangey
flavor
is
bready
with
some
mild
citrus
and
an
almost
milky
texture
a
touch
of

and
even
a

of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
a
little
light
on
flavor
for
the
abv
soft
smooth
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
this
beer
is
having
an
identity
crisis
does
it
want
to
be
a
strong
lager
it
has
the
abv
but
not
the
flavor
does
it
want
to
be
a
refreshing
lighter
lager
it
has
the
body
but
too
much
abv
decent
but
ltd
01
was
better
pours
amber
with
no
head
malty
and
a
bit
tangy
with
yeast
with
the
barest
bit
of
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
somewhat
grassy
and
with
some
malt
sweetness
but
with
none
of
the
yeasty
tanginess
i
like
in
the
style
fairly
one
dimensional
and
simple
and
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
smooth
and
relatively
drinkable
but
lacks
interest
pours
a
clear
light
orangered
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissappears
quickly
into
a
good
collar
nice
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
but
simple
some
malt
and
cereal
grains
with
some
hops
a
slight
bitterness
develops
in
the
aftertaste
beer
is
thin
and
light
on
the
tongue
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
since
it
is
light
i
recommend
it
as
a
session
beer
pours
a
lovely
golden
brown
color
with
a
light
whispy
white
head
and
some
decent
lacing
action
on
the
glass
slight
caramelly
aroma
mighty
smooth
flavor
of
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
grassy
herbal
hops
that
hides
in
the
background
and
sort
of
sneaks
up
at
you
right
on
the
end
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
certainly
isnt
a
flavor
explosion
but
really
well
crafted
very
smooth
well
balanced
goes
well
with
a
lot
of
food
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
after
taste
more
than
everything
else
what
a
great
lager
why
is
it
limited
we
need
more
lagers
like
this
on
a
year
round
basis
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
the
color
when
poured
into
a
glass
was
medium
yellow
with
no
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
of
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
along
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
flavor
was
like
the
aroma
except
for
a
mild
bitter
bite
on
the
palate
the
flavor
overal
was
good
not
outstanding
or
near
outstanding
but
a
nice
mild
pale
ale
other
comments
a
fairly
sound
lager
with
enough
complexity
to
give
it
some
character
d
i
believe
that
i
saw
a
few
reviews
say
they
liked
the
ltd
01
better
and
i
agree
this
guy
is
a
alright
brew
it
left

medium

but
expected
something
a

better
for

edition
pours
an
orangeamber
color
that
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
little
head
that
dissipated
almost
immediately
and
left
a
very
thin
film
along
the

aroma
was
very
hard
to
discern
flavor
was
a
bit
fruity
and
biscuity
medium
body
and
carbonation
decent
beer
with
good
drinkability
t
good
beer
but
as
a
special
it
just
doesnt
connect
like
i
said
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
good
special
golden
color
with
a
white
head
not
much
retention
aromas
of
biscuit
oranges
and
it
was
a
bit
floral
taste
was
of
biscuits
citrus
and
bread
pretty
good
medium

and
carbonation
an
ok
lager
that
i
wouldnt

trying

theres
just
only
so
much
than
can
be
said
about
a

its
better
than
a

not
by

but
stops
short
grainy
malt
with

would
go

to

it

there

and

tan
head

recedes
fairly

of
deep
sweet

well
beyond
what
you
would
expect
from
an
american

candy

also
mixed
in
taste

a
certain
biscuity
essence
which
is
offset
by
some
creamy
banana
and
then
some
subtle
hops

even
things
out
this
beer
resides
somewhere
between
summer
and

nice

clear

bright
white

settles
very
quickly
aroma
leans
towards
the

side
with
some
apple

taste
is
lots
of
sweet

goodness
with
very
little
hop
presence
to
tone
it
down
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
very
moist
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
beer
has
recently
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
nice
sessionable
and
tasty
beer
the
heavy
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
much
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
this
one
too
much
well
worth
trying
and
i
could
easily
sip
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
translucent
golden
orange
with
a
bright
half
inch
cap
excellent
consistency
and
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lacing
scent
was
sweet
malt
with
a
light
citrus
character
in
the
mix
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
a
skunky
quality
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
a
little
fullerbodied
than
anticipated
for
a
lager
with
a
consistent
effervescence
throughout
the
mouth
not
bad
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
brew
one
was
definitely
enough
love
the
local
drinkability
a
very
interesting
brew
i
was
feeling
something
light
and
this
hit
the
spot
kind
of
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
i
just
cant
get
too
excited
about
it
feel
and
drink
are
average
a
decent
brew
and
not
too
sweet
a
change
of
pace
for
full
sail
not
full
sails
best
by
any
means
but
not
horrible
these
type
of
lagers
are
not
really
my
thing
and
this
was
no
exception
will
skip
this
one
in
the
future
recommendation
goes
either
way
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
id
have
another
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
for
this
style
i
like
it
i
would
not
turn
it
down
like
i
didnt
with
this
one
but
would
not
seek
it
out
d
its
pretty
good
sort
of
a
weird
astringency
and
an
odd
malt
profile
d
a
pretty
good
beer
from
full
sail
a
tasty
high
alcohol
lager
kind
of
mix
between
a
maibock
and
a
malt
liquor
i
would
have
penned
it
as
maihelles
bock
on
first
tasting
it
appearance
needs
work
but
the
flavour
is
there
and
that
is
the
most
important
thing
would
definitely
have
again
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
amber
brew
head
recedes
quietly
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
grain
husks
and
some
fruitiness
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
hoppy
notes
on
the
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
nice
representation
of
the
style
not
too
exciting
but
decent
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
ever
had
d
this
was
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
poored
a
very
light
orange
amber
color
and
showed
plenty
of
carbination
and
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
smwlls
of
sweet
malts
and
floralgrassy
hops
tastes
like
bready
malts
up
front
and
some
underlying
sweetness
to
go
with
bitter
and
floral
hops
that
appear
in
the
middle
and
ride
to
the
finish
overall
its
a
well
done
lager
with
a
slightly
heavier
feel
than
most
but
still
drinkable
carbonation
is
spot
on
too
making
this
one
easy
to
session
although
the
sweetness
would
be
grating
after
a
while
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malt
with
alot
of
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
and
some
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
one
is
a
joy
to
drink
it
really
surprised
me
in
taste
recommended
a
pretty
good
offering
from
full
sail
would
buy
again
for
sure
despite
this
its
never
offensive
looks
pretty
and
is
fine
meh
mouthfeel
is
excellent
goes
down
smooth
and
has
no
aftertaste
drinkability
is
outstanding
i
would
go
out
and
buy
this
immediately
as
its
sadly
a
limited
edition
im
hoping
theyll
brew
more
of
this
as
its
an
outstanding
brew
liking
this
beer
is
a
nobrainer
i
really
like
this
beer
malty
and
fruity
it
makes
for
a
great
summer
brew
also
a
fine
alternative
to
the
hop
bombs
during
this
hop
shortage
were
having
they
call
this
a
limited
edition
but
i
cast
my
vote
to
keep
this
one
available
yearround
there
was
some
stickiness
to
the
body
and
it
had
medium
carbonation
smooth
easy
drinking
light
but
fairly
flavourful
it
arrived
with
a
fluffy
bonewhite
head
that
experienced
reasonable
retention
the
nose
had
the
characteristic
sweetness
of
a
lager
the
color
was
a
beautiful
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
the
lager
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
refreshing
and
served
to
cleanse
my
palate
following
deschutes
inversion
ipa
i
was
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
limited
release
mouthfeel
is
lighttomedium
bodied
and
smooth
from
start
to
finish
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
of
malt
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
worth
trying
for
sure
pours
a
clean
copper
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
light
malt
in
the
taste
a
small
maltiness
with
a
small
sweetness
a
smooth
decent
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
small
dryness
and
quite
clean
aftertaste
a
small
sweetness
and
light
taste
with
a
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
nice
lager
little
head
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
after
pouring
burnt
amber
in
color
clean
not
much
of
aroma
citrusy
and
a
faint
candy
the
fruitiness
citrus
bitterness
and
sweetness
kinda
meld
altogether
and
very
soft
in
the
palate
pretty
drinkable
stuff
will
drink
it
again

aftertaste

all
in

ive
never
had
a
lager
like
it
as
it
is
vaguely
hefelike
it
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
i
happened
to
like
much
i
would
recomend
this
beer
to
anyone
overall
in
my
opinion
it
was
not
the
best
beer
out
there
although
it
was
a
crowd
pleaser
i
would
definately
have
other
beer
from
this
brewery
i
am
drunk
bright
but
full
bodied
and
matted
a
bit
low
carbonation
and
an
overall
odd
texture
for
a
lager
an
interesting
style
for
sure
id
like
to
sample
some
more
beers
within
this
style
and
compare
them
even
though
my
friends
seemed
to
get
a
very
different
impression
of
this
beer
i
stand
strong
in
my
opinion
very
nice
this
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenbronze
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
rocky
and
white
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
with
a
trance
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
without
the
spicy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
in
texture
and
has
firm
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
d
abv
is
too
high
to
session
but
a
tasty
lager
none
the
less
worth
a
try
drinkability
if
all
lagers
drank
like
this
i
would
not
be
quite
so
prejudiced
against
the
category
the
beer
pours
an
orange
like
amber
with
a
monstrous
creamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
evaporates
leaving
a
fine
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
sweet
malt
nose
almost
fruity
clean
and
fresh
hints
of
caramel
more
ale
like
than
a
lager
with
the
top
medium
to
full
finish
once
again
has
an
ale
like
acidity
the
hops
delectable
sweetness
lingers
long
in
the
dry
aftertaste
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
and
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
the
head
retention
is
questionable
but
the
appearance
is
nice
with
a
deep
gold
color
this
brew
is
pretty
clean
has
a
good
flavor
slight
fruitiness
and
malt
in
the
begining
touch
of
caramel
crisp
citrus
bite
in
the
back
mild
alcohol
fumes
gain
more
definition
as
the
beer
warms
but
that
doesnt
hold
back
the
drinkability
choosing
between
the
two
series
i
prefer
this
2
series
more
12
ounce
bottle
best

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
white
head
which
goes
away
pretty
quick
it
smells
like
grain
toasted
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
tastes
like
sweet
malt
sugar
grapes
and
grain
its
a
sweet
tasting
beer
but
i
cant
taste
any
hops
at
all
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
smooth
has
a
decent
body
to
it
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
but
it
seems
a
little
too
unnaturally
sweet
overall
i
think
its
average
but
i
cant
say
im
impressed
at
all
ill
have
to
revisit
this
in
the
future
smells
of
grains
hay
and
a
slight
floral
hop
note
initial
taste
is
grounded
in
clean
malts
and
transitions
into
more
earthy
notes
finishing
with
some
hops
and
a
lingering
maltly
sweetness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
quite
heavy
for
the
style
which
im
still
a
bit
on
the
fence
i
really
like
the
body
of
the
beer
but
it
didnt
quite
fit
with
expectations
carbonation
is
done
well
and
doesnt
hinder
the
beer
in
any
way
all
in
all
its
quite
drinkable
i
enjoyed
the
deep
burnished
copper
color
but
for
a
lager
ltd
2
is
shy
on
the
suds
the
head
eclipsed
quickly
and
no
lace
formed
worth
mentioning
but
i
loved
the
sugar
toast
aroma
that
wanders
in
and
out
of
cherry
strawberry
and
kiwi
the
taste
is
of
gently
sweet
malts
modest
in
strength
and
somewhat
bocklike
the
wheat
malts
make
no
appreciable
appearance
available
april
thru
september
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
at
hops
in
humboldt
2007
in
fortuna
ca
this
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
nice
fat
offwhite
head
and
big
lacing
rings
very
attractive
nose
is
spicy
hops
and
light
malts
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
showing
medium
body
and
very
smooth
flavors
are
caramel
citrus
hops
and
are
in
good
balance
nice
bitter
finish
very
nice
to
drink
i
dont
like
bottling
02
as
much
as
i
liked
bottling
01
a
bock
but
its
still
worthwhile
beer
it
seems
past
time
for
bottling
03
to
have
been
released
doesnt
it
if
full
sail
had
designs
on
brewing
this
one
yearround
my
vote
would
be
dont
bother
drinkability
i
wouldnt
revisit
this
offering
from
full
sail
again
i
found
it
to
be
out
of
balance
in
aroma
and
taste
and
an
overall
bear
of
an
experience
tastes
wet
sweet
with
prominent
hop
flavor
and
mild
hop
bitter
mixing
with
a
gentle
carb
acrid
sting
hop
flavor
is
oranges
and
metal
steel
with
strong
aromatics
rising
retronasal
the
hops
make
this
a
light
bright
fruity
which
isnt
what
id
expect
from
a
lager
quite
thick
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
hanging
sweet
not
a
summer
simmer
thats
for
sure
modest
carb
of
fine
bubbles
that
is
more
aggressive
acrid
than
i
would
expect
d
this
is
where
i
feel
the
beer
dominates
i
could
drink
this
at
a
bbq
with
ease
copper
with
a
light
steady
stream
of
champagne
bubbles
head
pours
nice
enough
but
doesnt
last
very
long
the
nose
is
crisp
and
owned
by
malt
flavor
is
an
interesting
blend
of
caramel
and
bisquit
malt
with
a
finish
that
reminds
me
of
saaz
perhaps
it
is
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
by
any
means
but
theres
something
a
little
chalky
about
it
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
that
for
5
99
is
a
steal
at
trader
joes
quite
nicely
drinkable
as
all
lagers
should
be
no
strong
flavors
present
this
is
a
top
notch
lager
never
the
less
no
one
will
mistake
this
for
a
pilsner
the
bottle
said
drink
by
8307
i
drank
it
on
8607
i
cant
imagine
what
3
days
difference
makes
but
i
thought
i
would
point
that
out
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
an
attractive
medium
honey
color
with
thick
foamy
head
that
had
a
variety
of
bubble
sizes
and
active
bubbling
in
the
body
the
aroma
was
mild
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
yeast
the
taste
is
clean
refreshing
malty
intial
flavor
with
a
short
lived
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
it
was
light
bodied
with
relatively
dry
texture
and
active
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
summer
lager
that
is
refreshing
an
easily
drinkable
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
lightish
beer
that
is
not
overly
complex
i
would
like
to
see
more
breweries
including
something
like
this
not
everything
needs
to
be
big
and
complex
astringent
grain
hits
the
palate
first
but
quickly
gives
the
floor
to
a
juicy
tangerine
character
followed
by
deeply
biscuity
malt
really
great
full
malt
flavor
i
get
grassy
hop
in
the
dry
finish
possibly
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
5
in
my
mind
now
that
i
see
it
is
an
allmalt
is
that
it
is
a
little
hefty
on
the
palate
and
lacks
the
crispness
of
its
brother
session
really
wonderful
taste
though
would
be
amazing
with
pretzels
fullbodies
with
lively
carbonation
a
step
up
from
their
already
tasty
session
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
lots
of
drinkability
its
the
big
brother
of
session
its
got
a
touch
more
alcohol
touch
more
flavor
and
a
touch
more
beer
per
bottle
very
solid
summer
brew
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
beer
d
i
think
this
beer
suffers
from
an
identity
crisis
it
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
looks
like
a
lager
smells
like
a
lager
yet
drinks
like
a
bock
or
even
an
esb
the
malt
is
tasty
but
the
alcohol
seems
too
high
for
this
to
be
a
good
session
beer
overall
b
d
a
very
decent
amber
lager
but
not
great
overall
i
found
this
to
be
drinkable
but
could
be
better
the
taste
is
pretty
flavourful
im
getting
some
sweet
malt
and
grain
with
some
floral
hop
pungency
with
a
dash
of
earthy
tones
that
grows
in
presence
especially
about
midway
through
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
it
and
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
i
like
it
not
bad
a
bit
too
much
malt
for
my
taste
in
a
lager
seems
a
bit
out
of
balance
would
have
preferred
a
less
sweet
crisper
finish
like
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
lager
not
really
sessionable
but
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
to
try
it
its
not
bad
d
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
its
really
hella
good
per
label
but
nonetheless
tasty
good
appearance
is
light
amber
with
a
crisp
head
aroma
has
malt
and
a
grain
smell
to
it
taste
is
a
full
bodied
lager
from
the
all
malt
no
doubt
with
some
breadygrain
and
a
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
a
bit
creamy
but
not
thin
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
bold
lager
to
try
with
the
all
malt
and
abv
but
i
couldnt
drink
as
a
session
overall
i
bought
this
one
upon
the
urging
of
another
customer
at
the
beer
store
i
frequent
knowing
that
i
tend
to
shy
away
from
lagers
i
was
hesitant
the
price
tag
of
1
89
was
low
enough
to
influence
me
enough
to
try
it
though
after
drinking
it
its
safe
to
say
that
i
will
be
sticking
to
the
ales
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
have
the
feeling
my
ale
bias
has
come
thru
d
easy
to
drink
surprising
abv
of
6
4
makes
this
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
its
a
beer
thats
unassuming
and
begs
for
drinking
more
than
one
of
nothing
fancy
just
an
everyday
workingclass
lager
another
nice
one
by
full
sail
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
though
the
abv
is
just
a
little
too
high
for
it
to
be
considered
a
session
beer
this
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
evening
overall
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
allmalt
lager
very
tasty
and
drinkable
not
a
maltbomb
but
for
the
style
i
think
the
heaviness
and
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
is
great
there
isnt
anything
in
this
one
that
i
would
just
have
to
keep
having
but
very
a
solid
beer
im
hoping
ltd3
keeps
the
sweet
clover
honey
flavor
but
takes
the
potency
down
a
little
i
have
5
more
left
and
ill
drink
them
but
its
doubtful
ill
be
rushing
back
for
more
very
drinkable
brew
here
goes
down
smooth
and
has
no
rough
patches
to
keep
one
from
going
back
for
more
a
worthy
beer
from

slight

with
a
creamy
feel
goes
down
easy
thanks
to
talisker
for
the
extra
poured
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
weak
with
pale
malts
and
some
very
subdued
citrus
hops
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
is
remarkably
average
malts
with
highly
subdued
hops
nothing
worthy
of
a
special
release
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
not
all
that
refreshing
for
a
lager
overall
this
is
an
extremely
average
beer
an
interesting
lager
definitely
american
but
the
malt
profile
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
good
maibock
its
a
nice
amber
color
but
with
no
real
lacing
or
retention
the
aroma
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
along
with
the
caramel
grains
and
lager
funk
the
taste
is
a
nice
rich
mix
of
nutty
caramel
and
biscuit
grains
with
a
little
bit
of
esters
and
balancing
bitterness
to
round
out
a
nicely
balanced
lager
a
good
candidate
for
grilling
and
summertime
drinking
clear
and
bright
golden
orange
medium
sized
ivory
white
head
weak
retention
and
average
lacing
qualities
aroma
is
sweet
bready
and
malty
the
body
of
this
beer
is
damn
near
full
and
the
carbonation
is
noticeably
prickly
but
not
gaseous
flavor
is
just
kind
of
there
light
bready
malt
notes
and
a
little
biscuit
slight
hop
bitterness
is
noticed
not
a
lot
more
though
pretty
heavy
feel
for
a
lager
decent
enough
but
no
summer
session
beer
if
thats
what
youre
after
di
would
think
this
is
comparable
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
in
style
sa
has
more
of
a
hop
presence
and
seems
fuller
in
flavor
and
body
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
with
flavor
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
except
the
6
4
would
scare
me
a
little
as
i
like
to
drink
12to18
while
relaxing
around
the
pool
with
friends
still
the
is
no
question
this
is
a
quality
lager
worth
trying
drinkability
sessionable
for
sure
wish
they
made
this
a
regular
in
the
lineup
super
easy
to
drink
drinks
easy
enough
but
this
is
off
style
not
really
that
tasty
maybe
the
most
disappointing
beer
ive
ever
had
from
this
brewery
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
real
thirst
quencher
perhaps
a
touch
high
on
the
abv
6
4
to
be
a
sessionable
lager
but
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
and
would
go
well
with
food
grilled
chicken
or
fish
perhaps
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
very
clear
orange
there
was
almost
no
head
whatsoever
just
a
few
bubbles
the
smell
was
earthy
the
taste
was
malty
and
had
an
interesting
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
just
right
not
too
thin
decent
beer
but
i
just
cant
appreciate
lagers
the
way
i
appreciate
ales
d
ive
been
on
a
minor
lager
kick
lately
and
this
certainly
fits
the
bill
as
an
easy
drinking
and
tasty
lager
full
sails
ltd
series
isnt
like
most
extreme
limited
editions
and
therefore
its
a
great
change
of
pace
notes
if
this
was
brewed
year
round
and
available
often
in
my
area
this
would
be
a
staple
in
the
beer
fridge
excellent
drinkability
and
enough
abv
to
avoid
gobbling
gallons
of
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
these
all
malt
lagers
because
they
tend
to
have
more
flavor
and
if
they
can
avoid
being
completely
unbalanced
like
this
and
session
to
name
two
they
can
be
solid
for
twice
the
price
this
one
gets
its
doors
blown
by
its
little
brother
session
to
be
honest
i
passed
this
one
up
a
couple
of
times
because
of
the
less
than
flatering
description
on
the
packaging
this
beer
is
very
balanced
and
drinkable
to
say
the
least
will
buy
again
overall
impression
this
one
reminds
me
of
their
session
a
solid
drinkable
beer
nothing
overly
complex
but
a
nice
offering
as
the
warmer
months
approach
just
picked
up
tonight
i
guess
it
was
just
released
taste
is
a
bit
more
malty
than
hoppy
i
suppose
but
neither
are
particularly
prominant
very
bubbly
kindof
citrusy
iv
had
much
worse
the
ltd
series
by
full
sail
is
turning
out
to
be
pretty
good
though
a
bit
conservative
it
would
seem
i
liked
the
last
one
as
well
but
i
would
think
for
a
limited
edition
series
they
would
take
more
risks
with
some
200ibu
beer
or
a
pepper
beer
or
something
can
not
complain
though
an
easy
choice
at
the
grocery
store
served
on
tap
into
a
shaker
pint
ltd
lager
is
clear
and
light
brown
lots
of
effervescence
and
minimal
white
head
there
is
really
almost
no
oder
slight
malt
maybe
i
was
in
a
bar
but
no
smoke
and
pretty
much
empty
so
not
really
sure
how
much
that
was
an
issue
also
not
sure
what
is
really
expected
for
this
style
the
taste
is
really
good
it
is
pretty
sweet
and
malty
but
refreshing
and
finishes
cleanly
and
did
not
was
not
at
all
syrupy
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
other
then
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
they
go
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
in
spite
of
the
malt
helped
by
the
liveliness
of
the
active
carbonation
this
was
a
very
drinkable
lager
although
a
bit
dangerous
at
6
4
abv
sometimes
simple
is
good
this
would
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
macrolite
drinkers
that
would
see
this
and
say
i
dont
like
dark
beers
very
nice
looking
lagerhelles
deep
golden
with
a
nice
sized
thickfrothy
white
head
quite
a
clean
aroma
but
what
i
do
pick
up
is
some
hops
and
a
faint
lemony
zesty
aroma
sweet
and
malty
lager
to
begin
with
then
a
refreshing
zesty
hop
burst
mellows
the
sweetness
out
so
it
doesnt
ever
reach
cloying
maybe
a
little
tiny
bit
grainy
in
the
finish
but
it
goes
well
the
palate
is
quite
acceptable
for
style
overall
a
nice
summer
drink
very
drinkable
not
bad
highly
drinkable
which
i
suspect
is
their
target
for
a
particular
style
i
think
this
is
a
helles
lager
but
its
still
pretty
sweet
tasting
right
on
brew
from
full
sail
props
and
good
work
on
this
one
i
think
the
ltd
surpassed
batch
one
and
will
drink
down
easy
with
its
pretty
orange
label
when
i
hear
the
word
bock
my
expectations
are
very
high
there
was
nothing
too
exciting
about
this
brew
however
it
goes
down
really
smooth
for
7
abv
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
outstanding
but
is
a
worthy
one
to
try
especially
in
the
summer
on
the
hot
day
pairs
extremely
well
with
fried
fish
if
nothing
else
the
ltds
are
a
series
that
are
always
welcomed
if
not
for
their
brilliance
then
for
their
timeless
consistency
overall
i
dont
see
why
they
dont
call
this
a
imperial
pale
lager
rather
than
a
pale
bock
theres
no
bock
in
it
imo
nonetheless
its
a
really
good
beer
its
nearly
wow
but
not
exactly
wow
i
like
that
its
low
in
bitterness
but
still
has
enough
bite
and
growl
to
keep
the
pale
ale
from
being
too
much
its
a
goo
d
beer
but
im
disappointed
only
due
to
the
name
i
got
a
4
3
of
5
o
i
wish
that
more
lagers
were
like
this
one
thoroughly
enjoyable
very
drinkable
excellent
aroma
not
too
filling
overall
its
a
pretty
good
helles
lager
but
i
would
prefer
other
takes
on
the
style
not
bad
though
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
with
tall
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
and
bready
malt
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
of
grassy
spicy
hops
and
bready
malt
finish
is
long
dry
and
spicy
good
balanced
brew
overall
an
ok
helles
bock
overall
a
decent
malty
brew
with
a
fair
level
of
bitter
and
sour
flavors
not
bad
and
well
worth
a
try
but
nothing
super
exceptional
overall
its
okay
nothing
special
but
if
youre
using
this
7er
as
a
session
beer
youre
doing
very
well
its
easy
to
drink
although
a
bit
twangy
and
not
bad
i
imagine
if
youve
purchased
a
6er
and
heading
home
just
dont
get
too
buzzed
and
beat
the
girlfriend
but
it
is
a
very
decent
brew
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
a
very
decent
brew
aside
from
the
stout
i
think
i
need
to
see
what
else
this
brewery
has
to
offer
overall
a
very
good
tasty
brew
taste
is
a
little
sweet
but
some
clean
hops
to
balance
moutfeel
is
also
a
bit
crisp
still
a
very
tasty
brew
and
solid
hellesmaibock
quick
edit
noted
the
pale
malt
used
instead
of
pilsnen
could
be
why
the
sweeter
flavors
overall
although
there
is
some
diacetyl
and
a
sweetness
that
may
indicate
some
corn
in
the
grist
this
is
a
readily
drinkable
brew
3
75
d
good
beer
with
no
real
flaws
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
think
it
wasnt
bad
but
there
were
a
lot
of
strange
things
going
on
in
this
that
hinted
towards
bock
but
with
a
strange
twist
a
bit
overhopped
a
bit
more
alcohol
driven
and
lacking
in
the
overall
body
one
might
expect
i
greatly
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
matt
thanks
again
the
flavor
is
pretty
layered
considering
this
is
a
commercial
equivalent
of
a
smash
single
malt
and
single
hop
maibock
pale
malt
and
willamette
hops
the
hops
are
a
bit
forward
in
the
flavor
and
the
yeast
adds
some
flavor
with
spiciness
accentuated
by
the
moderately
high
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
malt
is
toasty
and
slightly
thick
with
low
sweetness
and
generally
grainy
when
combined
with
the
yeast
drying
alcohol
and
hops
overal
this
is
decent
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
from
east
coast
brewers
or
midwest
breweries
but
for
the
price
it
is
a
better
than
average
pale
bock
it
has
the
lighter
and
better
parts
of
a
bock
great
if
you
arent
keen
on
the
heavy
sweetness
of
a
traditional
bock
the
verdict
good
stuff
a
tasty
wellbalanced
pale
bock
that
i
managed
to
snag
the
last
couple
of
bottles
of
the
ltd
series
is
hit
or
miss
like
many
seasonals
though
its
usually
a
hit
this
one
is
definitely
a
hit
overall
nothing
spectacular
just
a
solid
brew
i
give
it
a
straight
up
b
o
light
and
sweet
not
very
good
compared
to
others
in
the
series
what
do
you
get
when
you
nearly
invert
the
bottle
when
decanting
into
a
shaker
glass
a
massive
three
fingers
of
dense
eggnogcolored
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
and
suddenly
king
midas
and
croesus
appeared
in
my
kitchen
both
licking
their
chops
the
lacing
that
formed
as
the
head
dropped
made
my
jaw
drop
my
my
my
nose
had
an
unexpected
earthiness
accompanied
by
a
caramel
maltiness
curiouser
and
curiouser
drink
me
it
cried
to
me
what
sort
of
host
would
i
be
not
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
an
invited
guest
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
fullness
and
i
got
a
bit
of
heat
from
it
as
i
swirled
it
on
my
tongue
the
taste
was
very
earthy
with
a
flavor
that
i
imagine
standing
in
a
field
of
barley
in
central
canada
in
the
summer
would
be
like
i
have
been
getting
smarter
about
distillation
and
i
would
bet
that
this
recipe
in
a
still
would
create
a
great
single
malt
whiskey
the
inherent
heat
on
the
finish
made
me
gasp
for
breath
but
overall
it
was
semidry
od
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
that
much
identity
between
a
lager
and
a
ale
seems
to
have
the
malts
and
hops
of
an
ale
and
the
yeast
carbonation
finish
of
a
lager
o
very
good
beer
easy
drinking
not
too
strong
great
session
beer
o
unfortunately
i
dont
think
ill
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
it
has
a
great
appearance
and
an
easydrinking
mouthfeel
but
its
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
for
one
its
too
hoppy
for
a
pale
bock
full
sail
lists
this
beer
as
having
45
ibus
which
is
just
too
high
for
the
bock
style
which
should
be
around
2030
ibus
if
youre
a
hophead
youll
like
this
rendition
of
the
bock
style
but
its
just
too
hoppy
for
me
secondly
i
get
pronounced
hits
of
butterdiacetyl
flavors
that
just
dont
belong
in
this
beer
the
butter
notes
mixed
with
the
hops
isnt
pleasing
after
the
first
few
sips
its
a
tasty
brew
i
would
say
if
youre
a
helles
bock
lover
try
this
one
its
a
bit
of
a
shock
if
youre
expecting
a
pale
lager
bmc
drinkers
probably
will
be
intimidated
by
the
abundant
flavor
not
quite
a
bock
i
suppose
but
not
fully
an
am
lager
either
a
well
done
pale
lager
easy
drinking
with
an
enjoyable
malt
and
hop
character
proves
that
this
style
can
be
flavorful
and
something
worth
drinking
a
tasty
well
done
lager

flavor
combination
but
kind
of
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
this
medium
bodied
an
interesting
malty
ale
i
have
to
say
the
ba
style
of
american
pale
lager
is
much
more
apt
than
the
bottles
label
of
pale
bock
this
is
not
very
close
to
a
bock
but
enjoyable
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
for
its
near
perfect
simplicity
and
balance
o
crisp
complex
malts
earthy
and
clean
with
a
gentle
punch
of
alcohol
to
keep
things
interesting
not
your
typical
low
abv
lager
this
has
depth
but
at
the
same
time
is
not
over
done
full
sail
seems
to
do
lagers
well
a
decent
enough
beer
semi
close
to
a
pilsner
taste
which
really
isnt
in
my
wheelhouse
but
worth
a
try
still
considering
all
factors
this
is
an
above
average
beer
product
i
like
the
snappy
hop
character
and
it
easily
outperforms
most
all
american
style
lagers
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
find
a
bottle
cheers
ugh
i
was
wrong
i
hate
it
when
beer
scents
trick
me
like
that
the
beers
not
bad
its
just
not
what
it
smells
like
and
its
not
at
all
astounding
the
bite
is
quite
nice
i
like
the
alcohol
level
and
i
like
the
grain
but
as
i
often
do
with
american
crafts
i
think
its
too
covered
by
hops
tastes
dryhopped
the
apricot
flavour
imparted
by
the
hops
sounds
nice
and
im
glad
its
not
overly
resinous
but
i
do
think
it
would
be
better
with
less
of
it
as
it
stands
its
an
ok
beer
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
little
head
but
has
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
heavily
of
a
roasted
malt
very
nice
full
aroma
tastes
of
lightly
roasted
grain
with
a
slight
fruity
taste
a
nice
surprise
this
light
bodied
beer
goes
down
real
smooth
and
has
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
floral
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
up
front
with
some
floral
and
perfumelike
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
ive
had
this
one
in
the
fridge
for
a
little
while
so
im
not
sure
how
fresh
it
is
anyways
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
semi
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
of
crisp
grassy
hops
a
little
sweetness
and
malts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
more
bitter
than
expected
followed
by
some
strong
malts
along
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
overall
its
an
average
tasting
lager
thats
held
back
by
an
unbalanced
flavor
and
an
even
more
unbalanced
palate
feel
i
wouldnt
recommend
buying
this
the
lagerhating
community
should
give
this
one
a
shot
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
o
neither
horrible
nor
spectacular
more
character
than
your
standard
american
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
fairly
easy
drinking
excellent
bang
for
the
buck
here
8
dollars
for
a
6pack
at
7
abv
i
like
that
smells
malty
but
not
to
the
vienna
lager
levels
more
pale
malty
and
crisp
in
the
nose
flavor
is
nice
definitely
malt
driven
and
complex
i
taste
something
a
touch
sweet
caramel
maybe
feel
dragged
for
me
in
this
beer
the
body
was
a
bit
heavy
and
rather
filling
even
though
the
flavor
was
good
i
was
happy
to
share
my
6er
because
it
would
have
ruined
my
appetite
for
dinner
overall
another
worthy
beer
from
full
sale
and
at
that
price
i
may
buy
it
again
but
it
wasnt
anything
particularly
memorable

a

i
can

describe
as

mixed
with

im
not

put
off
by
this

an
interesting
tasting
beer

not
something
i
would
recommend
but
something
i
would
certainly
pair
with
a
good
cioppino
or
manhatten
clam
chowder
3
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
to
sip
on
its
certainly
wellconstructed
i
doubt
id
be
inclined
to
drink
it
often
but
id
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
its
built
well
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
lacks
any
character
that
makes
it
memorable
i
appreciated
the
simplicity
but
i
think
there
are
better
offerings
from
full
sail
o
this
was
the
beer
of
the
month
at
zipps
which
makes
it
less
than
6
bucks
a
sixer
at
that
price
this
would
have
a
regular
spot
in
my
fridge
otherwise
its
something
that
id
get
every
so
often
a
nice
lager
o
a
really
nice
simple
and
well
made
lager
nutty
in
the
best
way
strong
while
not
tasting
like
it
gentle
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
flavor
considering
its
smash
status
a
really
great
easy
drinking
lager
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
overall
great
lager
against
the
likes
of
the
big
name
adjunct
lagerpilsners
i
dont
drink
lagers
often
but
when
i
do
pick
one
up
its
nice
when
it
has
flavor
like
this
for
the
style
this
is
a
winner
balanced
with
a
semidry
hopped
finish
o
too
bad
this
is
a
onetimer
in
fact
too
bad
the
limiter
lager
series
was
a
oneoff
i
like
pretty
much
every
one
of
them
and
no
4
is
no
exception
a
substantial
bready
malty
lager
with
a
crips
sulfuring
herbal
hoppy
finish
great
job
full
sail
and
keep
the
lagers
coming
i
actually
poured
one
and
a
half
bottles
into
a
half
liter
steina
clear
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
crown
atop
toasted
grain
and
a
sweetish
pizza
dough
quality
in
the
nosea
tinge
of
iron
and
sweet
alcohol
round
out
the
aromas
breadydoughy
malt
is
the
main
player
on
the
palate
with
the
mouthfeel
almost
to
the
chewey
point
for
me
wich
is
pretty
coolthere
is
a
peppery
hop
presence
felt
in
the
finish
hey
this
is
a
kick
ass
lagerin
some
ways
it
has
a
pale
bock
quality
to
it
but
its
not
a
pale
bock
its
just
a
well
made
big
american
lager
beer
well
done
full
sail
on
this
one
overall
a
very
good
single
malt
beer
that
nicely
blends
its
unique
single
malt
base
without
overpowering
one
with
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
nor
overbearing
alcohol
warmth
despite
its
7
0
abv
overall
this
beer
has
some
flaws
but
in
general
i
quite
like
it
even
though
the
categories
have
changed
from
the
old
days
im
giving
this
a
4
for
drinkability
if
you
want
a
solid
lager
that
is
going
to
deliver
exactly
what
is
advertised
you
should
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
thought
it
was
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
good
presentation
of
the
style
would
try
again
im
not
impressed
with
the
no
4
to
me
its
like
a
high
alcohol
bud
overall
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
a
interesting
front
to
it
that
is
a
bit
off
putting
the
backend
is
ok
but
not
good
enough
to
want
to
drink
it
again
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
drinkability
its
very
much
like
a
helles
bock
and
certainly
well
made
the
floralwoodyminty
hops
and
rich
malt
are
compelling
but
its
also
very
basic
its
easy
to
just
drink
it
and
be
satisfied
without
focusing
on
any
complexity
or
nuances
a
perfect
beer
for
spring
i
could
get
used
to
this
except
that
its
limited
d
good
drinkability
a
7
0
that
drinks
more
like
a
5
very
easy
to
down
enjoyable
in
multiples
with
much

great

lager
for
that
backyard
gathering
i
could
go

for

reminder
this
is
a

i
poured
from

perfect
pint
glass
the
pour
is
straw
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
nice

the
aroma
is
sweet
grass
the
beer
is
light
and
easy
drinking
clean
finish
the
body
is
light
well
carbonated
a
very
well
crafted
lager
surprised
that
it
is

this
beer
is
more
or
less
strohs
without
corn
upped
to
7
and
with
more
finishing
hops
i
dont
mean
it
as
an
insult
because
strohs
is
my
favorite
cheap
beer
i
bought
this
at
a
deep
discount
but
if
id
have
payed
full
price
id
be
pissed
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
a
lot
of
grain
not
really
very
exciting
but
nothing
offensive
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
grassy
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hops
also
mixed
in
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
very
exciting
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
a
malt
liquor
it
is
a
good
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
terrific
lager
though
as
strong
as
it
is
i
wonder
if
there
is
another
category
for
it
i
would
compare
this
with
a
golden
bock
like
the
one
from
karl
strauss
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
spot
on
for
the
style
this
is
a
little
boring
for
me
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
it

great
lager
this
is
a
drinkable
pale
lager
interestingly
malty
with
surprising
spicy
characteristics
d
good
drinkability
very
light
and
very
clean
md
a
light
bodied
and
crisp
light
lager
that
is
not
offensive
and
not
showy
it
does
its
job
and
for
that
its
worthy
just
drink
it
up
quick
these
ltds
fall
off
quick
especially
off
a
warm
shelf
in
jersey
you
could
quaff
this
for
a
long
time
very
good

i
wonder
if
this
isnt
like
what
macrolager
would
be
like
without
the
adjuncts
pretty
basic
crisp
pale
lager
with
some
depth
with
straw
color
and
some
pine
and
lemon
notes
leaving
a
residual
bitter
mouthfeel
no
aroma
of
any
significance
good
or
bad
much
higher
quality
than
a
bud
or
coors
but
of
the
same
family
you
dont
have
that
corn
aftertaste
though
id
like
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
summer
d
this
is
really
a
craft
malt
liquor
in
that
euro
strong
lager
category
all
malt
for
its
abv
its
cheaper
than
bmc
its
ok
but
theres
better
in
the
ltd
series
dr
id
have
it
again
but
not
at
this
price
it
hides
its
7
00
very
well
which
in
fairness
is
high
for
an
american
lager
the
alcohol
does
come
through
a
bit
in
the
finish
d
goes
down
easy
but
its
up
there
on
the

enjoy

this
is
a

a

comes

its
still
a

this
beer
is
nice
and
simple
and
i
like
that
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
ton
going
on
here
to
me
this
one
is
about
the
same
quality
as
the
rest
of
this
series
good
but
not
great
still
for
such
a
basic
beer
id
rather
not
have
the
hit
of
7
abv
tone
it
down
to
around
5
and
id
go
back
for
several
overall
a
well
balanced
lager
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
if
it
has
more
of
a
malty
or
more
of
a
hoppy
taste
and
i
guess
that
is
a
good
thing
drinkability
this
beer
was
very
easy

the

medium

drinkable
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
what
the
macros
should
achieve
for
d
the
beer
packs
in
a
surprisingly
good
amount
of
flavor
considering
its
made
with
just
a
single
malt
and
a
single
hop
yet
theres
no
way
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
pretty
tasty
brew
i
was
really
excited
about
a
commercial
smash
beer
despite
the
simple
and
straightforward
take
here
this
was
still
flavorful
crisp
and
ridiculously
easy
drinking
for
the
size
i
dont
think
that
ive
had
a
7
beer
as
sessionable
as
this
one
was
in
quite
some
time
count
me
in
as
a
fan
d
this
came
across
as
a
nice
halfway
point
between
a
pils
and
in
imperial
pils
it
was
a
nice
compliment
to
a
cool
winter
evening
for
a
single
malt
single
hop
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
one
pour
12
bottle
ltd
4
into
a
frosty
pub
glass
then
add
12
bottle
full
sail
session
lager
you
wont
notice
the
alcohol
nearly
as
much
and
the
flavors
blend
perfectly
knowing
the
dependability
of
full
sail
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
this
to
share
with
a
few
friends
some
of
whom
have
some
interest
in
beer
this
is
different
than
most
american
style
pale
lagers
i
have
had
so
it
is
a
fun
a
d
different
change
from
a
cool
local
brewery
all
i
can

by

the

is

the
aftertaste
starts
to
wear
on
me
too
much
to
want
too
much
of
this
without
a
break
still
quite
good
though
very
drinkable
beer
and
deceptively
strong
overall
it
is
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
a
good
drinkable
beer
dnotes
i
am
a
big
fan
of
full
sail
and
this
brew
is
certainly
a
good
one
its
not
the
best
they
have
every
done
but
pretty
damn
good
nonetheless
although
i
see
this
classified
as
a
euro
pale
lager
it
tastes
more
like
a
bock
version
of
a
german
dortmunder
style
lager
not
really
sure
if
there
is
such
a
thing
but
the
flavors
remind
me
of
the
style
this
brew
would
be
a
good
choice
for
pale
lager
fans
who
want
a
brew
with
a
nice
kick
at
7
abv
this
one
can
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
the
body
was
crisp
and
sharp
with
a
clean
finish
drinkability
was
pretty
good
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
overall
a
very
nice
brew
as
ive
found
the
ltd
series
to
be
overall
certainly
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
overall
drinkability
is
dangerous
and
good
tastes
great
is
smooth
and
hides
the
strength
well
d
overall
this
was
a
tasty
lager
i
loved
the
simplicity
of
the
ingredients
as
it
really
made
you
appreciate
the
flavors
of
these
components
the
higher
alcohol
content
brings
down
drinkability
a
little
as
it
leaves
a
little
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
knock
the
abv
down
a
little
and
you
have
an
extremely
drinkable
lager
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
i
would
definitely
prefer
more
pronounced
carbonation

clear

with

rather
thick

off
white
head
nice
enough
doughy
grassy
aromas
here
typical
lager
the
taste
is
very
surprising
though
there
is
indeed
an
interplay
with
some
really
nice
slightly
toasty
malts
and
a
nice
grassy
hoppiness
works
well
because
of
this
nie
interplay
it
maes
the
palate
very
pleasurable
overall
a
very
nice
clean
lager
from
full
sail
d
although
its
on
the
lighter
side
far
too
alcoholic
to
drink
all
night
on
the
other
hand
its
not
all
that
expensive
oh
well
taste
again
offers
lemon
notes
along
with
some
orange
and
a
bit
of
grain
finishes
with
a
lightly
coarse
bitterness
and
a
return
of
sweet
and
peppery
lemon
oil
feel
is
neutral
for
me
a
bit
thin
when
cold
and
firming
up
a
bit
with
warming
but
never
really
offering
much
as
a
result
it
drinks
rather
easily
sweet
enough
to
mask
the
alcohol
yet
not
so
much
to
be
cloying
or
mask
a
light
bitterness
on
the
finish
to
me
this
one
didnt
overall
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
quite
a
perfectly
formulated
light
bock
maybe
the
honey
takes
away
from
the
overall
profile
but
it
also
adds
some
good
flavor
good
but
i
wont
be
reaching
for
it
again
o
a
nice
helles
bock
from

with
a
lager
taste
i
wish
i
could
pick
out
more
but
i
cant
not
bad
wonderful
beer
crisp
clean
delicious
very
beautiful
looking
beer
and
very
subtle
and
delicious
honey
flavor
i
enjoy
this
beer
color
of
a
typical
lager
big
2
inch
fluffy
head
sweet
bready
aroma
kind
of
a
skunky
taste
dont
really
case
for
this
one
b
definitely
a
quality
beer
operating
in
beer
zombie
land
where
flavor
is
muted
by
govt
decree
some
bitterness
would
make
this
amazing
this
is
a
very
nice
light
bock
and
the
abv
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
on
those
cold
winter
nights
this
is
sweet
bock
to
drink
pun
intended
all
in
all
its
a
good
quaffer
overall
a
solid
bock
very
drinkable
overall
new
glarus
continues
to
do
lagers
so
well
this
bone
is
light
and
sweet
could
drink
it
all
night
its
a
stronger
pale
lager
with
honey
making
it
a
honey
bock
o
not
my
favorite
bock
from
ng
very
grainy
overall
nothing
special
but
still
a
really
solid
beer
drinkability
is
high
and
theres
enough
flavor
here
to
make
this
one
a
winner
light
color
fizzy
bonewhite
head
smell
is
some
spice
clove
honey
and
sweet
grain
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
like
honeycomb
yet
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
session
very
hebal
and
aromatic
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
wisconsin
pale
bock
the
aroma
didnt
do
much
for
me
but
the
taste
was
refreshing
and
unique
the
addition
of
clover
honey
really
imparts
a
lot
of
flavor
and
turns
what
wouldve
been
a
fairly
standard
lager
into
something
special
its
a
very
sweet
beer
so
that
may
divide
beer
drinkers
on
this
one
there
are
aspects
to
it
particularly
the
finish
that
remind
me
of
mead
an
alcoholic
drink
of
fermented
honey
water
for
the
layman
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
its
not
amazing
or
anything
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
tasty
treat
overall
refreshing
sweet
and
tastey
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
know
most
people
will
try
to
rate
this
lower
because
its
a
shelf
beer
but
if
i
am
honest
this
beer
is
world
class
for
the
style
and
nearly
overall
its
not
rare
its
not
ba
and
i
didnt
need
to
wake
up
at
4am
to
get
this
but
this
beer
is
fanfreakingtastic
overall
a
simple
beer
that
would
fare
better
with
a
little
more
character
more
spice
more
malt
taste
or
body
to
carry
the
higher
alcohol
content
i
like
the
kiss
of
sweetness
and
taste
from
the
honey
o
i
have
to
say
im
pretty
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
honey
scent
or
really
the
lack
of
an
scent
got
a
small
taste
of
honey
mixes
well
this
is
not
a
complex
brew
easy
to
drink
tho
i
dont
believe
i
would
buy
this
again
wow
this
is
way
more
awesome
than
i
was
expecting
sweet
enough
but
not
too
sweet
i
love
that
touch
of
honey
too
and
the
malt
finish
is
perfect
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
too
a
beer
i
could
see
being
refreshing
and
nice
hot
or
cold
outside
overall
a
decent
brew
for
the
maibock
style
light
but
has
an
interesting
kick
of
honey
pours
yellow
with
a
white
head
with
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
yeast
grain
honey
and
wheat
thin
watery
and
bland
taste
decent
carbonation
and
light
bodied
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
not
worth
trying
again
pours
a
yellow
color
with
an
okay
looking
head
nose
is
sweet
caramel
and
some
grain
hops
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
honey
that
moves
on
to
a
sweet
toffee
nutty
flavor
a
minute
amount
of
hops
show
up
on
the
backend
but
the
sweetness
still
holds
through
mouthfeel
is
full
and
really
smooth
overall
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
to
add
into
the
rotation
with
its
flavor
profile
o
i
like
honey
if
you
dont
you
wont
like
this
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
solid
little
bock
o
an
okay
refreshing
beer
but
forgettable
compared
to
many
others
at
new
glarus
o
i
think
this
is
very
solid
bock
nice
malt
profile
balanced
with
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
bring
really
bring
together
a
nice
beer
beer
is
eh
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
a
little
grainy
interesting
a
fine
little
lager
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
to
be
a
maibock
though
probably
not
a
repeat
for
me
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
some
faint
honey
and
a
bit
of
light
bready
malt
the
flavor
hits
the
light
honey
notes
again
with
a
touch
of
breadiness
through
the
finish
some
chewiness
and
a
lightmedium
body
good
carbonation
this
was
a
fairlysolid
brew
but
i
found
the
honey
to
be
a
distraction
o
not
as
bready
as
i
expect
most
helles
bocks
to
be
but
also
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
from
the
honey
that
i
expected
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
helles
just
not
very
bready
the
beer
is
light
yellow
and
transparent
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
consists
of
grain
bready
malt
a
touch
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
grainy
with
a
prominent
lager
malt
presence
fruity
aftertaste
light
bodied
with
moderately
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
ok
o
a
decent
beer
but
considering
this
is
my
first
beer
from
new
glarus
i
was
disappointed
d
a
bit
unpleasantly
surprised
here
just
an
okay
offering
from
new
glarus
i
dont
find
myself
commenting
on
the
names
of
beer
much
but
this
one
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
it
makes
me
think
more
of
early
spring
than
dead
of
winter
in
a
cabin
o
this
is
a
fine
beer
to
have
3
or
4
of
while
watching
a
football
game
a
little
more
floral
and
clean
than
high
life
but
that
comparison
isnt
far
fetched
its
an
ok
beer
and
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
o
while
not
spectacular
this
one
has
a
lot
more
positives
than
negatives
a
real
easy
drinker
that
i
would
gladly
recommend
all
in
all
i
like
this
as
a
session
beer
a
little
lighter
than
many
maibocks
but
its
also
more
well
balanced
something
new
glarus
is
amazing
at
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
has
a
dry
malty
scent
to
it
there
are
some
hints
of
honey
in
its
taste
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
great
drinking
texture
some
cinnamon
and
clove
spice
in
the
after
taste
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
wisconsin
day
maybe
i
dont
appreciate
the
style
fully
but
if
this
is
a
fair
representation
of
it
then
people
need
to
stop
knocking
american
adjunct
like
its
a
pos
cuz
this
beer
really
isnt
a
huge
switch
from
those
its
cleaner
all
around
which
is
the
key
difference
id
say
pours
out
a
lovely
transparent
golden
straw
color
with
a
single
finger
of
sticky
foam
collar
smells
very
bready
and
mildly
sweet
floral
taste
is
even
milder
than
the
nose
presents
lightly
carbonated
and
also
light
bodied
maintains
a
honey
bread
feel
and
flavor
throughout
everything
a
fun
thirst
quencher
that
does
make
me
think
about
spring
for
having
a
sole
hopping
emphasis
on
floral
tones
cons
it
could
stand
some
flavor
amplification
overall
another
solid
take
on
a
style
by
ng
there
is
a
good
reason
why
they
are
one
of
the
largest
breweries
in
the
us
they
competently
make
good
beer
d
this
was
a
delicate
and
enjoyable
brew
it
was
maybe
bolder
fresh
but
the
scent
and
taste
were
still
good
after
9
months
the
body
was
nice
too
and
there
was
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
but
its
still
recommended
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
holiday
beers
should
add
a
bit
of
sparkle
to
the
season
cabin
fever
suggests
a
bigbodied
winter
warmer
but
this
beer
steers
right
down
the
middle
of
average
lane
nice
malt
with
caramel
notes
but
overall
seemed
a
bit
thin
some
drying
aspect
toward
the
finish
with
moderate
lingering
bitterness
o
not
complex
but
overall
its
a
nice
simple
refreshing
beer
another
good
beer
from
new
glarus
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
but
as
it
turns
out
its
merely
okay
not
a
failure
in
any
way
just
not
one
of
new
glaruss
finer
moments
o
quite
enjoyable
especially
for
the
style
not
sure
why
it
doesnt
have
a
better
average
on
ba
im
guessing
some
of
the
reviewers
dont
understand
or
appreciate
the
maibock
helles
bock
style
on
the
lighter
side
of
maibocks
in
a
quite
enjoyable
way
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
another
new
glarus
offering
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
as
an
extra
this
is
another
one
that
poured
with
virtually
zero
head
pours
a
golden
pilsner
type
color
although
a
bit
clouded
the
nose
is
remniscent
to
their
apple
ale
it
smells
like
crisp
apples
touched
with
honey
the
first
taste
reminds
me
of
much
the
same
more
lightly
tinged
apple
with
a
touch
of
honey
this
would
be
a
decent
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
delicate
the
faintest
taste
of
apples
is
left
behind
all
in
all
this
isnt
too
shabby
nothing
incredible
nothing
awful
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
could
put
a
few
back
if
its
what
someone
had
about
looks
great
and
smells
and
tastes
pretty
good
im
not
sure
if
this
is
weak
for
the
style
in
flavor
or
if
the
other
maibocks
ive
had
are
overcompensating
but
still
a
fine
brew
from
my
favorite
brewery
overall
its
once
again
a
great
brew
from
new
glarus
overall
another
wonderful
beer
from
new
glarus
i
have
very
limited
access
to
these
beers
and
each
time
im
able
to
get
one
its
worth
the
wait
cheers
thanks
to
taturbo
for
this
one
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
clear
yellow
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
leave
just
a
thin
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
kind
of
on
the
weak
side
not
too
much
going
on
really
besides
some
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
and
has
a
subtle
sweetness
to
it
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
overall
i
found
it
to
go
great
with
my
dinner
the
mouthfeel
had
a
good
almost
medium
body
to
it
with
a
good
carbonation
also
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
theres
a
lot
to
like
about
this
maibock
as
with
most
everything
from
new
glarus
this
beer
is
very
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
the
flavors
dont
shout
however
they
are
smooth
and
harmonious
on
the
palate
as
im
somewhat
averse
to
honeyflavored
anything
and
this
beer
is
billed
as
a
honey
bock
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
the
honey
notes
actually
enhance
the
overall
taste
profile
this
beer
is
certainly
worth
your
time
whether
it
be
the
dead
of
winter
or
the
dog
days
of
summer
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
nicely
done
future
outlook
the
first
meh
beer
ive
had
from
ng
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
decent
enough
beer
in
what
represents
a
pretty
boring
style
to
me
no
matter
an
outofstater
that
i
wont
likely
have
again
soon
drinkability
far
from
an
inyourface
highgravity
bock
cabin
fever
would
definitely
be
a
good
choice
if
i
were
stuck
in
a
cabin
during
the
latewinter
it
offers
a
tasty
and
satisfying
complexity
without
providing
a
serious
buzz
the
cpj
overall
very
drinkable
in
fact
really
could
not
get
enough
of
this
one
its
a
style
i
see
far
too
little
of
as
of
late
and
would
relish
the
chance
to
touch
base
with
it
again
overall
i
didnt
think
this
was
bad
it
wasnt
good
but
it
also
wasnt
horrible
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
before
the
honey
taste
got
a
bit
cloying
small
white
head
tops
a
medium
hazed
golden
colored
brew
scent
is
sweet
lagered
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
pretty
bready
taste
sweet
malt
honey
light
hop
bitterness
touch
of
warming
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
sharpness
pretty
nice
brew
o
not
bad
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
new
glarus
id
be
amazed
if
leininkugels
put
out
a
beer
like
this
but
i
guess
i
just
have
higher
standards
for
new
glarus
even
so
its
still
an
alright
beer
that
would
be
a
good
choice
to
introduce
someone
to
the
maibockhelles
bock
style
thanks
to
friend
schmittymack
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
at
our
mini
and
unintentional
new
glarus
fest
2
weeks
back
this
one
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
tight
white
head
very
sweet
on
the
nose
with
lots
of
honey
on
the
palate
this
one
was
thin
bodied
sweet
and
dry
with
flavors
of
honey
and
biscuit
o
a
nice
brew
nothing
too
unique
or
exceptional
here
but
well
crafted
o
just
didnt
blow
me
away
and
felt
the
honey
was
a
little
too
prominent
in
this
one
ive
had
my
eye
on
trying
this
for
quite
some
time
so
i
finally
did
it
might
be
inclined
to
pick
it
up
again
if
the
mood
strikes
poured
into
the
trusty
pint
shaker
glass
again
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lingered
a
bit
malt
and
honey
on
the
nose
with
sweet
malt
honey
a
touch
of
citrus
and
very
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
not
too
bad
but
again
i
dont
think
id
really
pursue
this
one
again
o
very
mild
and
lagerlike
this
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
expect
for
a
maibock
with
the
honey
addition
here
giving
this
a
bit
more
of
an
approachable
nature
than
what
i
would
normally
find
in
the
style
this
was
overall
pretty
flavorful
though
and
drank
rather
easily
for
6
this
is
definitely
a
good
starter
for
getting
someone
into
bock
beers
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
and
could
easily
put
back
a
few
before
noticing
any
alcohol
notes
well
hidden
and
just
a
delicious
helles
bock
i
would
call
it
a
very
interesting
lager
flavorful
and
refreshing
maybe
i
have
to
start
checking
out
obscure
wi
breweries
i
had
a
bad
experience
with
obscure
in
breweries
good
experience
with
obscure
ny
breweries
i
will
need
to
pay
attention
to
the
cheese
heads
o
i
could
crush
a
ton
of
these
drinkability
another
winner
from
new
glarus
they
consistently
impress
me
with
great
wisconsin
beers
this
one
is
very
tasty
and
refreshing
and
the
honey
adds
an
element
to
the
maibock
style
that
helps
it
stand
apart
from
others
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
this
is
a
very
nice
spring
or
fall
beer
as
im
drinking
it
now
im
thinking
about
all
the
light
summery
lagers
ill
be
drinking
in
the
next
few
months
and
how
this
forms
a
bridge
to
them
from
the
porters
stouts
and
barleywines
of
winter
but
i
could
just
as
easily
see
it
as
a
last
hurrah
before
settling
in
for
the
winter
we
midwesterners
know
about
such
things
a
very
good
slightly
sweet
bock
pleasant
little
bock
poured
a
nice
light
brown
not
a
lot
of
head
on
it
and
what
was
there
was
a
bright
white
that
quickly
disappeared
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
to
try
out
most
of
new
glaruss
beers
as
i
see
them
and
sadly
ive
only
gotten
to
rate
a
couple
of
them
so
far
i
only
live
an
hour
from
the
brewery
so
this
is
a
poor
showing
on
my
part
this
beer
had
a
clean
finish
and
was
quite
refreshing
i
could
easily
drink
it
for
a
session
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
seemed
just
right
for
me
ill
definitely
be
drinking
it
again
in
the
near
future
not
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
was
a
very
nondescript
bock
and
if
anything
it
was
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
and
not
in
a
good
hoppy
way
but
in
a
tough
to
drink
way
i
dont
know
if
having
off
a
tap
made
a
difference
as
maybe
the
line
was
dirty
or
something
but
it
wasnt
until
the
very
end
that
i
got
any
hint
of
the
honey
or
other
sweet
flavors
that
is
supposedly
in
this
beer
i
have
had
it
twice
at
a
local
establishment
only
because
it
is
the
best
craft
beer
option
available
there
and
i
dont
mind
supporting
a
local
brewery
even
just
with
locally
brewed
bocks
though
i
can
think
of
a
few
that
i
would
drink
before
this
one
at
least
it
is
not
bud
light
d
a
milder
yet
cleaner
and
smoother
maibock
almost
richer
at
the
same
time
but
that
is
probably
perceived
that
way
due
to
its
sweetness
not
bad
as
a
maibock
it
really
doesnt
work
at
all
to
me
a
maibock
should
be
pretty
assertive
the
hops
should
have
a
good
kick
and
the
malt
should
be
bold
i
am
not
a
great
describer
of
flavors
but
bocks
have
a
certain
background
flavor
that
i
can
only
describe
as
bocky
maybe
bready
in
a
beer
bread
sort
of
way
and
this
beer
doesnt
have
it
o
drinks
pretty
well
the
honey
adds
a
nice
touch
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
larger
head
that
lasted
through
out
the
beer
there
wasnt
much
in
line
of
a
smell
the
taste
was
on
the
lighter
side
but
had
a
full
flavor
and
a
nice
taste
of
honey
as
well
nicely
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
differnt
flavor
very
unquie
but
still
good
i
say
this
is
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
boring
but
does
nice
nice
job
overall
drinkability
a
light
mouthy
honey
lager
different
that
some
of
the
more
bitterdry
maibocks
i
have
tasted
i
like
it
a
nice
like
brew
that
is
suited
to
year
round
consumption
if
it
were
available
would
go
great
in
midsummer
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
weaker
the
malt
is
buttery
and
biscuity
and
the
hops
dont
really
show
themselves
in
the
flavor
like
they
should
they
add
flavor
but
arent
assertive
they
do
nothing
to
balance
the
sweetness
i
generally
like
ng
lagers
but
this
one
fails
in
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
am
glad
i
picked
one
instead
of
6
up
d
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
bock
beer
that
you
should
at
least
try
i
liked
back
40
so
much
i
went
and
picked
this
one
up
right
away
yup
i
know
this
one
is
a
maibock
and
b40
is
a
bock
but
i
like
dead
guy
so
i
thought
i
would
really
like
this
one
too
nope
dont
really
care
for
it
much
i
popped
it
open
and
quickly
poured
into
a
pint
it
looked
pretty
good
a
golden
yellow
and
a
fair
sized
head
i
leaned
in
and
took
a
good
sniff
right
away
i
thought
oh
no
it
is
sweet
smelling
with
a
cheap
beer
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
better
though
still
mainly
a
sweet
bready
taste
with
maybe
a
sleight
hint
of
spice
not
much
else
it
has
a
thicker
feel
with
a
sticky
finish
that
didnt
work
for
me
im
not
really
looking
forward
to
finishing
this
six
pack
if
any
of
my
opinions
change
on
this
beer
ill
come
back
and
ad
them
but
for
now
i
just
dont
care
for
this
beer
poured
an
average
golden
straw
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
foamy
white
head
on
it
smell
is
very
faint
a
bit
of
grain
light
honey
taste
but
mainly
just
a
average
beer
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
not
much
body
to
it
but
a
good
light
flavor
not
bad
if
the
price
is
right
another
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
beer
it
just
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
and
is
really
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
craft
beers
to
bmc
drinkers

nothing

but

i
could
easily
destroy
a
6
pack
of
these
in
a
heartbeat
yum
d
4
simple
and
clean
but
sufficiently
flavorful
a
cheerful
beer
for
someone
stuck
in
a
snowedin
cabin
indeed
gotta
say
im
diggin
it
though
maybe
im
just
in
a
generous
mood
and
subconsciously
im
comparing
it
to
the
swill
i
just
drank
easy
enough
to
drink
and
id
be
fine
drinking
more
than
one
but
i
doubt
ill
pick
it
up
more
than
a
couple
of
times
a
year
it
doesnt
drink
as
well
as
i
would
expect
for
the
style
its
not
a
refreshing
beer
and
i
dont
know
when
id
feel
like
drinking
it
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
for
free
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
or
recommend
it
to
any
of
my
beer
friends
pours
a
slightly
richer
than
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
semi
loose
head
that
tightens
up
and
becomes
fluffy
and
beautiful
and
leaves
some
good
lace
on
the
glass
the
initial
aroma
reminds
me
of
the
boiling
beer
on
the
stovetop
when
you
make
bratwurst
not
a
bad
smell
at
all
just
not
one
you
usually
get
from
beer
prior
to
bringing
it
to
a
boil
this
gives
way
to
a
the
dominant
aroma
which
is
bready
baguette
all
of
this
is
accented
with
some
nice
but
light
floral
notes
i
really
like
the
way
this
smells
its
aromatic
but
simple
its
subtle
and
clean
but
has
some
very
definitive
characteristics
none
the
less
the
flavor
is
also
very
clean
and
has
some
nice
finesse
the
thing
that
catches
me
right
away
is
that
the
beer
is
dry
far
more
dry
than
the
typical
product
that
advertises
honey
as
a
definitive
ingredient
to
the
beer
the
flavor
that
the
honey
imparts
is
not
likely
sweetness
as
the
bit
of
that
thats
in
here
seems
to
be
covered
pretty
well
by
the
malt
as
opposed
to
any
adjunct
there
is
some
spiciness
and
richness
that
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
good
honey
but
i
will
admit
that
if
it
didnt
say
honey
on
the
bottle
it
is
not
very
likely
that
i
would
have
picked
on
on
much
honey
flavor
which
is
of
course
ironic
because
honey
flavor
seems
to
be
a
very
definitive
characteristic
to
many
palehellermai
bock
beers
beyond
this
whole
honey
bit
there
is
a
nicely
subtle
hop
zing
mainly
in
the
herbal
vein
the
bready
maltiness
is
just
slightly
toasty
and
there
is
just
a
slight
hint
of
cereal
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
damn
well
balanced
wonderfully
crafted
lager
the
likes
of
which
are
some
of
the
most
exciting
beers
that
new
glarus
makes
the
palate
is
just
lightly
sharp
and
the
beer
is
fabulously
easy
to
drink
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
as
i
write
this
i
am
finishing
the
bottle
as
opposed
to
the
barley
wines
i
have
this
many
notes
for
after
about
two
oz
i
would
happily
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
beer
drinkability
not
too
bad
while
ive
had
a
better
helles
bock
in
my
time
i
still
enjoyed
it
pretty
reasonable
balance
for
the
style
and
was
pretty
refreshing
worth
a
shot
especially
if
youre
in
a
lager
type
of
mood
overall
a
very
standard
and
refreshingly
simple
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
nothing
really
brings
your
hand
back
to
the
glass
for
another
sip
a
decent
beer
but
lacking
in
the
maibock
department
d
the
first
time
i
had
this
brew
i
didnt
care
for
it
but
the
second
time
i
had
it
had
changed
my
mind
maybe
it
was
the
first
bottle
but
this
brew
didnt
turn
out
to
bad
it
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
i
will
have
this
brew
again
d
this
beer
wasnt
offensive
in
any
way
it
just
refused
to
have
anything
wow
me
a
good
drinker
but
i
probably
wouldnt
try
this
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
fairly
balanced
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
nice
otherwise
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
easy
but
isnt
very
good
atypical
but
good
and
worth
a
try
at
the
very
least
dnot
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
probably
pick
up
again
glad
to
have
tried
it
well
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
is
indeed
drinkable
not
something
i
would
reach
for
again
overall
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
fireside
or
poolside
it
is
a
fun
mix
of
light
and
refreshing
as
it
is
fresh
out
of
the
fridge
with
complexity
and
rich
malt
character
as
it
warms
as
is
typical
with
maibocks
you
cant
really
tell
this
is
6
abv
warmer
or
colder
this
brew
is
up
there
on
drinkability
and
i
am
happy
to
have
a
few
more
left
drinkability
a
light
not
quite
crisp
honey
lager
it
is
what
it
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
regularly
seek
out
pours
a
clear
straw
golden
color
with
a
yellow
tinted
off
white
head
initially
fluffy
and
thick
and
fades
to
a
cap
and
film
with
streaky
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
caramel
like
and
prominent
honey
notes
with
additional
hints
of
grain
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
with
the
honey
dominating
the
flavor
with
the
caramel
malt
body
not
quite
as
much
grain
or
breadiness
in
the
body
as
expected
medium
bodied
with
fine
soft
carbonation
overall
fairly
boring
and
one
dimensional
for
my
taste
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
crisp
refreshing
sweet
summer
beer
than
a
winter
selection
this
is
an
unusual
beer
in
that
it
doesnt
really
fit
a
style
its
hard
to
know
what
to
make
of
it
in
several
ways
it
is
a
lot
more
like
a
really
well
brewed
malt
liquor
than
a
helles
bock
the
thing
that
its
missing
for
any
style
of
bock
is
that
malty
richness
of
munich
malt
that
at
least
i
associated
with
all
bocks
on
the
other
hand
its
a
really
clean
tasting
beer
that
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
d
first
taste
from
new
glarus
and
considering
its
not
fruit
related
its
very
quality
brew
would
pick
this
up
by
the
6
pack
if
i
could
get
it
overall
a
very
nice
beer
you
should
get
some
thanks
thomashardy
for
the
opportunity
full
disclosure
time
i
had
a
touch
of
cold
left
over
and
i
probably
shouldnt
have
been
reviewing
but
i
couldnt
resist
poured
a
spotted
cow
after
this
beer
and
it
tasted
normal
but
wanted
to
give
full
disclosure
on
this
one

behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
spice
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
alittle
spicyness
medium
body
drinkable
a
very
tasty
brew
i
like
it
an
extremely
technically
accurate
view
on
the
style
nothing
at
all
is
off
base
drinkability
uggghhhh
not
new
glaruss
best
work
its
not
horrible
but
the
honey
is
too
much
and
i
dont
get
much
of
anything
bock
in
this
it
was
literally
hard
to
put
down
a
12oz
bottle
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
tad
maybe
add
of
touch
of
nutty
or
roasted
malt
and
we
might
have
something
pours
a
clear
and
bubbly
golden
color
that
is
slightly
richer
and
brighter
than
a
bmc
not
nearly
as
dark
as
i
would
expect
a
maibock
the
aroma
is
almost
sickly
sweet
the
honey
is
very
readily
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
a
little
overly
sweet
for
my
taste
the
sweetness
coats
the
tongue
and
reminds
in
the
mouth
long
after
the
beer
is
swallowed
drinks
well
here
no
hang
ups
taste
is
like
a
cream
ale
rather
sweet
with
an
over
the
top
mouth
feel
not
one
of
my
favorite
types
but
was
easy
to
drink
and
not
bad
tasting
overall
it
is
a
solid
brew
and
would
be
awesome
at
a
cookout
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
good
maibock
it
has
nearly
everything
i
look
for
in
a
good
bock
beer
its
easy
on
the
eyes
good
malty
flavor
characteristics
and
a
great
feel
the
only
thing
it
lacks
is
the
aroma
factor
give
this
sucker
a
sweet
smell
and
youve
got
a
true
winner
once
again
nice
job
to
my
friends
in
southern
wisconsin
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
very
golden
yellow
color
with
a
clean
white
head
the
aroma
was
nice
and
balanced
with
clean
crisp
malt
presence
and
a
slight
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
quite
light
compared
to
a
normal
bock
beer
and
that
is
disappointing
there
is
decent
balance
and
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
sweet
than
i
would
expect
but
a
decent
brew
not
likely
to
buy
again
but
was
ok
to
try
d
drinkability
is
high
with
this
brew
i
know
it
eludes
to
drinking
it
on
cold
nights
on
the
label
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
beer
more
suited
for
the
summer
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
pretty
high
here
also
i
havent
had
too
many
maibocks
that
i
like
but
i
like
this
one
this
would
be
the
perfect
brew
to
drink
while
sitting
at
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
skal
a
tight
little
bock
oddly
id
prefer
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
day
like
today
which
reached
a
sweltering
90f
than
in
the
winter
either
way
this
is
good
drinking
here
drinkability
fine
d
like
with
many
ng
beers
this
is
more
of
a
session
beer
for
the
masses
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
flavor
but
wont
scare
anyone
away
if
you
are
looking
for
a
standout
ng
offering
look
elsewhere
while
this
beer
is
not
perfect
it
is
another
solid
offering
from
new
glarus
while
a
touch
more
hops
may
have
pushed
the
beer
to
top
notch
status
the
beer
is
excellent
for
what
it
isa
refreshing
drinkable
lager
that
is
suitable
for
nearly
all
palates
other
than
those
that
are
only
tuned
to
imperials
of
this
and
that
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
its
a
lighter
beer
but
has
enough
flavor
to
make
it
a
nice
drinking
lighter
beer
probably
not
enough
flavor
for
my
personal
tastes
but
a
good
version
of
the
style
overall
this
falls
in
the
good
for
the
style
category
very
drinkable
i
respect
new
glarus
for
brewing
good
examples
of
subtle
styles
rather
than
doing
just
high
abv
bal
aged
stuff
d
do
not
match
with
a
meal
drink
alone
mor
drinkable
than
my
buddy
lukaski
said
it
was
d
this
beer
was
ok
nothing
special
but
not
bad
would
have
liked
a
little
more
out
of
the
smell
and
taste
this
works
as
a
light
spring
beer
though
it
just
felt
sort
of
overly
simple
for
it
to
really
stand
out
overall
i
think
they
hit
what
they
were
attempting
to
do
which
is
make
a
beer
a
shade
shy
of
a
helles
bock
with
some
honey
added
this
beer
is
well
made
and
a
far
cry
from
the
extreme
beer
craze
that
we
are
in
the
middle
of
now
in
the
craft
beer
world
and
that
is
a
bit
refreshing
is
it
an
a
in
my
book
no
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
fitting
for
springtime
i
do
feel
that
a
touch
more
hops
would
have
helped
even
out
the
beer
a
bit
more
in
my
opinion
though
new
glarus
has
helped
me
learn
to
like
lagers
and
other
seemingly
plainjane
beers
like
spotted
cow
and
naked
and
can
see
myself
growing
to
like
this
one
two
more
bottles
in
the
fridge
so
will
give
it
another
try
the
beer
pours
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
corny
with
some
wheat
the
flavor
is
corn
wheat
some
fruit
and
honey
not
very
much
hop
character
in
the
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
nothing
special
brandspankin
new
off
the
shelf
pours
strawcolored
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
clear
not
much
of
a
nose
light
malts
with
a
little
sweetness
definately
a
decent
malty
taste
up
front
with
a
decent
background
honey
flavor
showcases
this
flavor
much
better
than
another
wisconsin
honey
beer
that
shall
remain
unnamed
crisp
with
low
to
medium
body
mild
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
very
good
and
refreshing
just
not
anything
outlandish
i
might
take
spotted
cow
over
this
highly
highly
dissapointed
i
hate
to
see
standout
like
black
wheat
go
away
and
things
like
this
replace
it
crystal
clear
bright
sun
yellow
body
thin
and
wispy
dirtied
white
froth
sits
on
top
it
clings
nicely
to
the
walls
of
my
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
solid
sweet
malty
and
honeyish
with
malty
being
the
most
dominant
aroma
the
flavor
is
grainy
malt
with
sweet
honey
accents
fairly
nondescript
solid
for
what
it
is
but
not
a
lot
of
depth
or
richness
carbonation
is
fairly
prickly
and
the
body
is
medium
very
even
keeled
and
mellow
flavor
is
similarly
husky
and
grainy
with
a
very
bare
hint
of
clover
honey
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
light
and
fizzy
it
doesnt
hold
your
attention
enough
to
drink
much
of
this
closer
to
a
macro
lager
than
any
bock
ive
had
just
not
enough
in
the
flavor
department
d
very
good
sessionable
beer
would
like
to
drop
a
few
during
the
hot
summer
months
here
in
st
louis
this
lager
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
light
golden
colorone
might
call
it
honey
colored
the
head
is
clingy
and
bright
white
the
aroma
is
moderately
maltygrainy
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
crisp
lagerlike
aroma
the
flavor
is
moderately
malty
smooth
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
slightly
dry
finish
which
balances
the
malt
nicely
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
with
a
medium
body
overall
this
brew
is
quite
deliciousstraightforward
crisp
malt
with
nice
hop
bitterness
makes
me
start
to
think
of
spring
drinkability
i
like
most
of
the
stuff
produced
by
new
glarus
but
this
ones
not
particularly
inspired
i
might
take
it
ahead
of
a
spotted
cow
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
therefore
ill
give
it
a
bump
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
is
this
going
to
be
the
new
trend
for
new
glarus
dumbed
down
beers
that
appeal
to
masses
like
a
pbr
or
honey
weiss
which
i
consider
this
beer
to
be
quite
similar
to
i
know
times
are
tough
but
this
brewery
thrived
on
brewing
world
class
beers
i
hope
this
is
just
a
blip
on
the
map
and
the
new
beers
that
are
going
to
be
released
this
year
will
be
exceptional
new
glarus
needs
to
get
back
to
brewing
top
notch
world
class
beers
and
stop
worrying
about
appealing
to
masses
with
these
beer
people
who
drink
mass
produced
lagers
arent
going
to
buy
this
at
the
price
anyway
ngs
market
is
with
people
who
roam
this
site
i
hope
things
improve
throughout
the
year
best
of
luck
dan
d
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
an
adjunct
lager
from
one
of
the
big
brewers
with
a
touch
of
honey
added
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
really
had
high
expectation
for
this
beer
given
the
original
description
but
i
feel
it
falls
so
short
and
disappoints
i
see
this
beer
as
the
winter
version
of
totally
naked
and
a
direct
competitor
to
honeyweiss
this
is
the
full
bodied
winterequivalent
of
that
beer
and
while
i
see
it
will
please
the
people
who
this
is
targeted
to
i
find
it
a
travesty
that
beers
such
as
uffda
bock
black
wheat
coffee
stout
and
hop
hearty
had
to
be
shelved
to
make
room
for
this
why
not
just
make
totally
naked
all
year
round
it
feels
like
a
brewery
i
know
can
make
some
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
is
now
catering
to
the
least
common
denominator
in
order
to
pay
for
the
new
brewery
i
really
hope
the
rest
of
the
new
beers
being
introduced
this
year
are
not
a
dumbed
down
version
of
styles
bas
know
new
glarus
can
hit
a
home
run
in
if
they
wanted
in
summary
ng
used
more
expensive
ingredients
and
a
more
intensive
brewing
process
but
failed
to
produce
anything
that
is
better
than
a
crappy
macro
looks
really
like
a
clear
honey
with
a
light
creme
tan
head
really
tastes
like
a
macro
with
maybe
a
hint
of
honey
man
this
a
llight
and
to
put
it
blunt
a
pretty
crappy
bock
dont
get
me
wrong
its
probably
what
ng
was
going
for
some
weak
beer
that
spotted
cow
people
would
drink
but
i
need
more
flavor
d
i
can
see
the
reason
that
this
wont
be
rated
very
highit
isnt
boisterous
with
enormous
flavours
it
is
subtle
and
very
easy
to
drinknot
something
i
am
likely
to
pick
up
again
but
a
nice
sessionable
beer
from
new
glarus
d
cabin
fever
is
an
average
beer
with
decent
drinkability
its
nothing
to
be
proud
of
but
certainly
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
id
have
it
over
spotted
cow
as
a
session
beer
d
exceedingly
refreshing
we
really
enjoyed
the
subtleties
of
the
natural
honey
throughout
this
pours
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
with
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
sweet
malts
and
honey
with
a
touch
of
floral
really
not
much
to
get
excited
about
its
a
sweet
beer
with
the
honey
and
malts
some
grainy
corn
shows
up
very
little
hop
bitterness
pretty
boring
i
was
expecting
something
with
much
more
of
a
complex
flavor
it
doesnt
have
any
bad
or
off
flavors
but
it
doesnt
anything
great
to
offer
either
they
could
call
this
a
pale
lager
and
make
it
a
summer
seasonal
and
not
miss
a
beat
its
still
ten
degrees
outside
i
need
something
bigger
ill
give
this
another
go
sometime
hoping
that
right
now
either
its
off
or
i
am
my
present
opinion
is
that
its
the
worst
thing
new
glarus
has
even
released
cabin
fever
is
not
overwhelming
in
any
sense
of
the
word
in
fact
craftbrewed
macro
might
be
an
appropriate
term
for
this
beer
it
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
macro
brew
which
sadly
isnt
my
thing
however
it
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
lightmedium
body
making
it
quite
sessionable
im
surprised
this
beer
rounds
out
at
6
abv
it
drinks
like
a
4
abv
beer
the
feel
is
super
light
but
decent
drinkability

i
distributed
this
beer
to
3
of
my
beer
loving
judging
friends
and
ive
recieved
back
2
dissappointing
reviews
while
the
3rd
has
yet
to
try
the
beer
if
i
were
to
review
this
in
the
summer
months
i
might
give
it
a
solid
c
rating
but
the
release
time
on
this
one
isnt
feeling
correct
to
me
i
do
love
most
of
the
ng
beers
and
eagerly
await
new
releases
overall
a
super
drinkable
beer
not
thay
this
is
a
surprise
considering
the
source
keepem
coming
ng
pours
a
nice
golden
tan
color
with
a
great
fresh
head
and
sticky
lacing
till
the
end
it
looks
good
and
fresh
with
a
pure
white
ring
the
smell
is
malts
and
fresh
baked
bread
followed
by
some
floral
hops
a
pleasant
springlike
clover
smell
the
taste
is
malts
first
and
in
a
good
way
followed
by
the
floral
hops
it
finishes
crisp
and
clean
and
a
little
sweet
its
highly
drinkablevery
flavorful
another
fine
bock
from
ng
that
is
well
balanced
with
malts
and
hops
and
honey
nothing
overwhelms
in
this
one
recommended
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
body
the
only
downfall
is
the
sweetness
and
low
hop
flavor
i
am
accustomed
to
a
bit
more
in
a
maibock
but
a
good
beer
all
the
same
sadly
this
is
not
the
stunner
i
was
expecting
to
replace
hop
hearty
but
it
will
do
for
now
until
i
run
out
o
this
beer
tastes
like
an
authentic
german
maibock
it
would
make
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
chilly
spring
or
fall
day
overall
a
tasty
and
excellent
example
of
the
maibock
style
crisp
and
clean
but
still
complex
for
a
maltforward
brew
definitely
something
i
would
order
again
o
i
dont
know
this
style
well
enough
to
say
if
this
is
a
good
true
to
style
maibock
or
not
i
just
know
i
really
liked
it
o
another
well
made
german
style
beer
from
a
relatively
local
nj
brewery
this
one
is
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
and
pairs
very
nicely
with
bavarian
style
food
while
there
is
a
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
beer
id
have
another
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
basic
wellmade
lager
with
a
bit
of
alcoholic
punch
barely
detected
in
the
aroma
or
taste
but
felt
somewhat
in
the
body
after
a
glass
or
two
o
not
my
first
choice
this
one
pours
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellowish
gold
color
the
head
is
fluffy
at
first
and
leaves
a
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
plenty
of
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
full
of
malts
and
has
a
sweeter
flavor
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
in
he
lighter
side
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
brew
for
this
style
light
refreshing
and
sweet
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
finishes
fairly
dry
and
bitter
despite
the
prevalent
breadiness
of
the
malts
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
at
best
in
my
opinion
theres
no
memorable
qualities
here
although
its
a
fine
tasting
beer
maybe
i
just
think
this
style
is
boring
but
i
have
had
much
better
maibockshelles
bocks
i
would
definitely
classify
this
more
towards
the
helles
side
quite
light
in
flavor
profile
like
a
good
sessionable
german
pilsner
at
such
a
high
abv
you
cantwouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
this
would
be
enjoyable
to
session
on
a
hot
day
because
of
the
freshing
qualities
it
offers
but
at
7
5
i
wont
be
wasting
my
consumption
limit
on
this
brew
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
an
easy
sipper
of
a
beer
and
each
sip
follows
the
earlier
one
quite
naturally
ill
certainly
be
having
this
one
again
in
addition
it
was
an
excellent
counterpoint
to
the
seafood
gumbo
that
was
lunch
the
paring
worked
well
in
that
the
malt
countered
the
spiciness
of
the
gumbo
and
both
played
off
of
each
other
quite
nicely
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
well
made
maibock
that
demonstrates
nicely
that
good
german
style
beers
can
be
made
in
the
us
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
an
ambergolden
hue
with
over
two
fingers
of
white
head
generous
amounts
of
carbonation
great
head
retention
and
very
good
lacing
smelled
very
malty
with
caramel
apple
and
some
herbal
noble
hop
notes
the
taste
was
a
little
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
with
a
very
nicely
balanced
fruitmaltiness
and
finishing
on
a
crisp
dry
note
medium
to
thickbodied
but
when
mixed
with
the
generous
carbonation
it
creates
a
nice
mouth
sensation
very
feint
hint
of
heightened
alcohol
content
makes
this
yet
another
dangerously
drinkable
beer
from
these
guys
i
think
i
see
a
trend
here
i
like
this
beer
and
feel
it
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
high
point
did
something
extraordinary
with
this
maibock
that
is
they
brewed
a
beer
in
new
jersey
that
tastes
like
it
could
have
come
from
bavaria
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
growler
from
big
zs
pours
a
deep
burnt
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
bready
lager
malt
and
some
sweet
fruits
flavor
of
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
cardboard
and
bready
malts
a
little
sweet
and
on
the
bland
side
not
bad
just
uninteresting
d
i
guess
for
the
alcohol
content
its
pretty
easy
drinking
but
i
didnt
find
myself
wanted
more
than
one
im
not
the
biggest
maibock
fan
perhaps
this
is
why
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
others
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
its
impressive
but
i
just
dont
think
they
all
meld
together
well
enough
maybe
its
just
my
personal
thing
about
all
maibocks
but
nonetheless
very
good
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
american
version
youre
gonna
get
from
a
brewery
that
quietly
makes
top
notch
germanstyled
beers
clear
amber
color
with
a
short
offwhite
head
that
was
revived
with
each
swirl
of
the
glass
leaving
some
spots
of
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
noble
hop
bittering
medium
bodied
crisp
and
smooth
feel
make
this
a
good
brew
to
drink
and
welcome
the
change
of
season
this
i
think
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
when
is
in
the
midst
of
hop
overload
drinkable
enough
this
might
be
the
best
maibock
ive
ever
had
the
balance
of
flavors
is
perfect
the
only
think
i
could
say
is
i
wish
it
was
a
touch
stronger
in
taste
it
had
this
pairs
of
the
sweet
cherry
and
red
licorice
malt
sweetness
with
underlying
crisp
biscuit
and
a
hit
of
grassy
herbal
hops
for
balance
some
maibocks
are
too
plain
or
are
too
sweet
this
beer
is
just
damn
tasty
overall
a
tasty
maibock
a
nice
lighter
bock
for
warmer
days
d
the
alcohol
tastes
more
than
it
really
shows
not
too
impressed
by
this
version
a
very
nice
solid
clean
brew
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
even
though
the
alcohol
became
more
pronounced
as
this
warmed
nice
brew
worth
seeking
out
well
brewed
nicely
balanced
and
very
clean
solid
offering
from
ramstein
pour
is
a
bit
darker
than
i
expected
from
a
maibock
little
head
with
mild
lacing
and
slight
head
retention
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
roasted
caramel
falvor
dominates
both
the
nose
and
taste
throughout
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
drinkable
to
the
point
of
being
dangerous
quite
drinkable
for
7
5
hides
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
slightly
bubbly
with
a
toffee
sweetness
prosit
it
was
a
nice
treat
to
find
this
ontap
at
pearly
bakers
the
other
day
it
was
even
recommended
by
the
bartender
its
nice
to
see
this
brewery
distributed
in
pa
now
as
well
anyhoo
this
brew
is
a
nice
lightdark
red
colour
with
tinted
orange
highlights
and
a
nice
cap
of
tannishwhite
foam
the
aromas
are
all
fresh
breadybiscuity
malts
and
green
leafy
fresh
german
hops
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
biscuity
with
a
nice
touch
of
those
fresh
hops
keeping
everything
together
in
a
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
good
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
a
real
winner
of
a
maibock
from
this
awesome
wheatbasedbeerbrewery
id
love
to
try
their
new
beer
soon
as
well
i
hear
it
is
a
killer
apa
nice
great
spring
beer
drinkability

i
loved
this
ramstein
to
death
it
is
the
first
really
good
maibock
that
ive
had
here
in
the
us
dont
try
to
sip
this
all
night
long
though
at
7
5
abv
this
one
is
unusually
high
in
alcohol
and
actually
quite
filling
amber
orange
with
a
clingy
white
head
and
a
fruity
tootsieroll
smell
tasted
like
caramel
brown
sugar
spiced
apples
and
milk
balls
that
have
been
stripped
of
their
chocolate
coating
and
a
wee
wee
wee
bit
o
hops
great
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
lower
than
average
carbonation
that
helps
bring
out
the
flavor
shocking
that
a
this
is
7
5abv
b
its
being
served
to
me
in
a
20oz
glass
and
c
i
want
another
one
and
another
hell
i
could
drink
this
all
night
im
in
a
bar
surrounded
by
fabulous
expensive
belgian
beers
and
this
is
the
5
20oz
tap
special
and
i
could
still
drink
it
all
night
wow
a
mild
tealike
and
citrusy
hop
taste
provides
a
little
counter
to
the
big
malt
sweetness
the
potent
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
this
is
a
highly
gulpable
brew
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
out
of
a
filled
2
liter
growler
crystal
clear
yellow
orange
with
a
white
lasting
head
clean
malty
aroma
the
way
a
lager
should
be
big
long
malty
flavor
that
lasts
on
the
tongue
crisp
clean
finish
slight
hop
note
in
the
background
this
years
is
the
best
ever
great
maibock
i
wish
this
were
more
available
but
alas
hopefully
the
standard
established
by
this
years
batch
can
be
maintained
in
the
years
to
come
this
will
be
hard
to
find
dont
wait
for
the
nest
open
house
grab
a
growler
call
greg
and
ask
when
he
can
fill
it
get
yourself
up
to
the
brewery
try
all
his
beers
backwash
i
dont
normally
review
beers
in
front
of
the
computer
but
after
a
few
at
yesterdays
open
house
and
one
from
the
growler
last
night
i
still
wanted
a
refresher
this
is
another
big
winner
from
ramstein
which
doesnt
make
a
bad
or
even
mediocre
beer
heaven
help
its
competitors
if
they
decide
to
stray
from
their
mission
of
make
great
germanstyle
beer
but
i
guess
that
would
be
a
bit
like
ferrari
deciding
to
make
a
station
wagon
i
had
last
years
version
later
in
its
lifecycle
so
it
had
mellowed
somewhat
but
i
think
i
like
this
years
even
better
in
any
event
this
is
a
worthy
successor
to
their
octoberfest
winter
wheat
and
eisbock
oranges
blend
with
a
big
malt
character
to
start
you
off
a
beautiful
hop
presence
balances
it
out
to
a
masterpiece
dry
bready
aftertaste
in
the
end
and
maybe
you
can
pick
up
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
but
you
really
have
to
look
for
it
it
is
smooth
with
a
very
light
carbonation
the
body
is
as
full
as
it
could
be
for
the
style
with
loads
of
flavor
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
day
long
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
pick
up
a
growler
for
easter
but
the
one
i
have
will
not
last
long
at
all
a
beautiful
drinker
that
is
complex
with
flavor
and
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
it
looks
damn
good
too
this
is
not
one
to
miss
but
unfortunately
many
people
will
another
ok
beer
in
a
tall
can
this
is
obviously
mass
produced
bock
intended
to
be
consumed
in
substantial
quantities
the
high
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
so
this
would
be
a
dandy
beer
for
an
octoberfest
oom
pa
pa
overall
definitely
not
terrible
and
the
alcohol
is
virtually
imperceptible
when
cold
but
otherwise
not
terribly
exciting
starts
off
neutral
mostly
pale
malt
theres
a
creaminess
to
the
flavor
the
swallow
sours
a
bit
and
the
aftertaste
is
brief
i
note
a
brief
spice
of
hop
just
after
the
swallow
the
body
is
proper
the
carbonation
tilts
toward
the
higher
side
pale
blondeorange
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
with
some
retention
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
smell
is
malty
and
bready
sweet
candy
like
notes
some
fruits
come
across
as
well
light
hint
of
corn
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
malty
and
fairly
sweet
some
green
apple
flavours
as
well
light
alcohol
heat
some
grassy
notes
come
off
as
well
lightly
bitter
maltysweet
finish
light
carb
medfull
body
decent
weight
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
and
in
all
respects
isnt
very
good
however
there
is
something
i
really
enjoy
about
this
beer
and
i
will
still
buy
this
as
my
staple
one
for
the
road
beer
o
im
not
appalled
by
this
beer
it
is
just
a
hefty
adjunct
lager
in
my
opinion
and
not
worthy
of
my
glass
lol
o
i
will
check
this
off
on
my
bucket
list
no
need
to
experience
this
one
again
overall
its
not
a
beer
i
will
remember
that
much
but
for
now
it
works
before
lunch
time
overall
the
taste
seemed
little
bit
harsh
at
times
but
for
the
most
part
its
a
fairly
enjoyable
above
average
beer
not
something
id
ever
buy
again
but
it
wasnt
a
waste
of
money
overall
this
definitely
tastes
like
a
maibock
and
not
just
a
strong
lager
but
it
isnt
the
best
representation
of
the
style
holsten
maibock
started
off
as
a
seinfeld
episode
a
beer
about
nothing
but
became
more
like
a
david
lynch
film
pretty
strange
hard
to
assess
and
even
harder
to
tell
if
i
liked
it
im
not
sure
what
to
think
i
love
the
style
but
it
is
inherently
a
pale
strong
lager
which
means
that
if
done
poorly
it
constitutionally
becomes
a
malt
liquor
that
confusion
doesnt
happen
with
the
styles
best
examples
with
this
one
however
its
up
to
interpretation
final
grade

a
c
grade
500ml
can
from
the
lcbo
pours
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
the
head
dissipates
leaving
some
patches
on
top
of
the
beer
smells
quite
grainy
with
a
very
faint
grassy
aroma
almost
no
bitterness
very
sweet
though
flavour
is
fairly
clean
and
for
a
cheap
high
alcohol
beer
i
can
see
the
appeal
in
this
i
think
it
tastes
better
than
macro
lagers
and
it
certainly
punches
higher
at
7
alcohol
poured
a
golden
yellow
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
a
collar
retains
throughout
filtered
body
nose
of
light
sweet
malts
light
cereals
some
sweet
pale
candy
and
some
grain
taste
follows
with
a
general
sweetness
some
honeylike
sweetness
cracker
and
some
graininess
in
the
finish
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
but
overall
does
the
trick
if
your
looking
to
warm
up
just
a
bit
like
i
was
it
poured
a
clear
golden
colour
with
a
2
finger
head
that
left
some
pretty
decent
lacing
it
smells
fairly
sweet
with
a
little
floral
hop
smell
and
some
grassy
tones
it
tastes
very
similar
to
what
the
smell
is
like
more
malt
forward
with
a
little
tangy
taste
of
hops
at
the
end
fairly
light
in
flavour
and
body
but
for
7
abv
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
but
as
it
warmed
up
to
room
temperature
the
alcohol
became
very
pronounced
but
not
to
overbearing
an
adequately
drinkable
and
certainly
affordable
maibock
in
the
guise
of
a
euro
strong
lager
and
less
boozy
than
many
continental
bocks
that
ive
sampled
just
the
thing
to
hit
the
spot
as
the
weather
unsurprisingly
turns
heh
south
and
it
seems
to
work
as
a
suitable
pairing
to
the
spicyass
rogan
josh
that
is
imminently
arriving
to
my
dinner
table
medeum
body
and
carbonation
a
little
sweet
for
a
big
session
a
500ml
can
of
7
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
one
of
my
fave
winter
brews
though
d
pretty
good
for
a
getting
drunk
cheap
beer
not
impressive
tastewise
though
the
alcohol
isnt
too
noticable
but
its
noticable
enough
to
take
away
from
what
could
have
been
good
d
relatively
easy
drinking
like
most
of
the
german
offerings
you
will
find
in
a
canadian
liquor
store
but
the
higher
abv
and
the
metallic
flavours
start
to
build
up
to
make
the
experience
less
enjoyable
d
once
im
done
this
can
i
think
ill
keep
it
at
that
this
isnt
like
the
festbock
which
is
good
imo
there
isnt
enough
of
a
balance
for
me
to
want
to
drink
this
more
might
be
good
for
a
beer
can
chicken
though
once
the
booze
burns
off
as
the
sweetness
could
liven
up
the
meat
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
aroma
of
malt
apples
light
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
overly
sweet
and
dominated
by
the
alcohol
and
very
little
hops
in
this
gets
worse
as
the
beer
warms
up
not
very
good
i
wasnt
able
to
finish
this
and
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
deep
gold
in
colour
with
a
poorly
retained
fizzy
white
head
faint
pale
malt
and
alcohol
aroma
it
tastes
like
a
severely
underattenuated
and
underhopped
pilsner
a
little
bit
of
white
bread
with
very
little
hop
flavour
or
bitterness
to
offset
its
honeyed
sweetness
alcohol
isnt
hot
but
still
feels
harsh
everything
else
is
so
mute
that
booze
really
is
the
dominant
flavour
in
this
beer
booze
and
sugar
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
it
feels
both
thin
and
syrupy
terrible
beer
this
must
be
germanys
answer
to
malt
liqour
looks
like
another
tall
boy
can
in
the
icebox
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
pungent
head
shop
clove
smell
pours
to
a
golden
colour
with
a
creamy
white
head
taste
is
a
weighty
funky
almost
skunky
mix
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
is
a
dubbellike
maltiness
and
sweetness
followed
by
a
large
and
in
charge
hoppiness
made
up
of
noble
hops
this
seems
like
something
to
be
imbibed
in
the
biergarten
out
a
2
liter
mug
no
less
das
ist
gut
excepting
for
the
funky
twang
on
the
aftertaste
otherwise
the
early
workings
of
a
belgian
not
too
chabby
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
looking
for
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
this
again
soon
unless
im
broke
and
want
to
wash
some
worries
away
i
can
drink
it
but
i
dont
like
it
alcohol
character
made
it
feel
somewhat
heavy
for
me
one
or
two
of
these
might
be
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
it
is
very
favorable
for
a
longer
session
overall
this
is
just
bland
and
inoffensive
and
yet
im
having
a
hard
time
choking
it
down
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
although
for
the
price
its
not
bad
d
looks
smells
ok
but
once
its
in
my
mouth
it
loses
some
of
its
appeal
one
is
enough
not
as
good
as
some
of
holstens
other
beers
try
it
if
you
have
experience
with
bock
beers
as
this
may
turn
you
off
or
turn
you
on
to
that
type
of
beer
its
literally
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
d
one
is
enough
final
thoughts
the
main
reason
i
bought
this
beer
was
because
i
had
a
good
experience
with
the
festbock
this
one
however
is
nowhere
near
as
good
an
offering
one
beer
was
enough
of
this
stuff
anymore
then
one
i
think
it
would
outstay
its
welcome
1
and
done
for
me
someone
mentioned
it
needs
more
hop
to
balance
it
out
very
1
dimensional
taste
pretty

boil

you

i
love
watching

i
tried
this
beer
on
march
18
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
orangygold
colour
with
a
generous
white
fluffy
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
the
aroma
was
very
grassy
with
very
little
other
discernable
aromas
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
ample
carbonation
with
a
little
bitterness
the
flavour
was
again
a
lot
of
grass
with
a
little
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
when
it
comes
to
holsten
brews
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
festbock
but
better
than
the
premium
taste
well
aspirin
this
beer
was
so
astringent
that
i
could
barely
make
out
anything
else
for
around
10
minutes
then
i
noticed
some
honey
sweetness
obviously
its
hoppy
but
its
far
too
astringent
to
be
enjoyable
however
you
couldnt
detect
the
higher
alcohol
content
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
plus
or
not
anyone
whos
ever
drank
lowenbrau
the
stuff
thats
actually
made
in
europe
will
recognise
the
flavours
of
this
beer
it
almost
seems
like
holsten
stole
the
lowenbrau
recipe
and
fortified
it
a
bit
im
not
a
fan
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
would
much
rather
have
somthing
else
d
great
drinkablility
and
very
refreshing
not
too
strong
or
powerful
to
be
hindering
on
the
drinkability
d
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
strength
of
the
beer
and
its
odd
flavours
overall
this
is
the
last
holsten
beer
im
ever
having
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
or
something
sadly
the
taste
didnt
offer
much
in
the
way
of
thrills
it
was
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
with
only
faint
hops
leading
to
a
dry
finish
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
this
may
be
a
bit
of
a
crazy
observation
but
it
almost
tasted
like
a
watereddown
belgian
tripel
to
me
this
may
have
set
me
off
holsten
for
life
crisp
hop
bitterness
hits
the
palate
with
a
decent
malt
body
but
it
tasted
like
the
can
somewhat
no
alcohol
was
detected
whilst
it
was
cold
a
good
froth
in
the
mouth
sweetens
it
up
and
releases
the
alcohol
presence
a
good
smooth
beer
but
still
feels
like
a
european
macro
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
as
it
warms
up
the
alcohol
is
more
present
on
the
palate
not
bad
but
all
the
while
i
still
felt
like
this
was
a
heineken
with
a
higher
grain
bill
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
in
the
future
if
only
to
supplement
the
festbock
although
the
smell
is
not
very
nice
you
get
used
to
it
after
a
couple
sips
d
have
one
then
move
on
to
something
else
that
will
challenge
your
tastebuds
pours
a
medium
piss
yellow
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
nearly
nonexistant
with
a
bit
of
slightly
rotten
grain
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
medicinal
with
piles
of
phenol
and
corn
and
very
little
hoppiness
or
anything
of
any
interest
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
still
with
some
crisp
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
decent
disappointing
poured
a
dark
orange
with
a
little
head
not
too
bad
to
look
at
smell
is
nothing
special
a
little
metallic
actually
taste
is
rather
sour
with
offensive
bitterness
and
skunkyness
reminiscent
of
a
bad
malt
liquor
it
however
does
not
leave
much
of
a
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
not
too
bad
and
it
is
somewhat
bearable
i
dont
expect
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
any
time
soon
d
a
bit
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
quite
tasty
imo
starts
off
like
a
tripel
but
finishes
like
a
vienna
lager
or
a
pils
maybe
i
like
it
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
taste
wise
there
are
better
beers
out
there
skip
it
the
head
on
my
holsten
maibock
started
wispy
and
quickly
disappeared
the
beers
colour
is
golden
and
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
maltiness
of
the
taste
the
relatively
high
abv
isnt
driven
to
the
fore
not
imbibing
in
many
bocks
i
cant
fairly
compare
this
beer
to
others
of
its
type
i
did
like
it
though
and
would
try
it
again
can
poured
a
golden
color
beer
with
below
average
head
aroma
is
quite
weak
for
a
bock
and
only
faint
malt
can
be
detected
taste
is
very
disappointing
kind
of
like
a
foul
lager
body
is
bit
thin
with
some
alcohol
burn
total
lack
of
complexity
in
this
beer
pours
out
to
a
bright
golden
lagerlike
color
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
that
or
caramel
and
bread
dough
the
taste
is
excellent
and
in
my
opinion
very
underrated
here
there
is
a
malt
sweetness
that
isnt
cloying
yet
balanced
on
the
swallow
i
would
drink
this
again
without
hesitation
a
bit
high
abv
for
a
session
beer
but
i
think
i
could
handle
the
session
its
so
rare
that
you
come
accross
a
maibock
on
the
shelf
let
alone
in
january
this
one
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
left
some
lacing
nice
yeasty
bock
aroma
with
some
good
malt
and
little
or
no
hops
the
flavor
is
good
bitter
then
breadlike
maltiness
and
then
an
odd
finish
dry
and
corn
bread
like
overall
this
is
a
nice
surprise
even
if
it
doesnt
pack
the
maltiness
of
other
maibocks
that
ive
tried
pours
a
golden
with
a
big
whispy
near
white
head
that
becomes
a
foam
ring
quite
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
bready
slightly
fruity
toasty
malts
and
wiffs
of
hops
and
corn
the
taste
is
very
thin
with
a
prominent
alcohol
feel
theres
a
little
bit
of
husky
grain
and
a
lager
yeast
crispness
the
hops
are
overpowered
by
rubbing
alcohol
alcohol
flavors
maybe
this
beer
was
too
thoroughly
fermented
its
body
is
thinnish
and
it
lacks
depth
in
its
malt
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
unevenly
carbonated
theres
a
sweet
slightly
vegetal
finish
this
beer
could
really
use
some
more
body
to
mask
its
7
abv
as
it
is
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
i
dont
know
i
keep
thinking
i
got
a
bad
can
it
literally
got
worse
and
worse
as
i
struggled
through
it
it
poured
rather
well
for
a
can
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
why
do
i
smell
rum
taste
ack
its
like
there
is
a
shot
of
rum
in
this
the
abv
is
not
hidden
at
all
its
like
boilmaker
to
be
chugged
not
savoured
sorry
folks
i
tried
but
this
one
was
most
unpleasent
500
ml
can
with
a
clearly
marked
freshness
date
on
the
bottom
strong
malt
in
the
nose
that
almost
drowns
out
any
hop
sweet
malt
and
a
chewy
finish
dominated
by
the
toffee
like
sweet
malt
gold
pour
with
a
white
head
and
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
this
is
a
quite
thin
and
boring
maibock
rather
sweet
and
bland
i
dont
dislike
this
beer
eventhough
it
is
a
poor
maibock
the
taste
is
fairly
malty
with
a
decent
sweetness
this
is
much
better
than
the
straight
pilsner
that
they
make
it
is
drinkable
and
better
than
a
crap
na
macro
but
when
you
taste
a
superior
maibock
such
as
paulener
or
ayinger
it
does
pale
in
comparison
if
you
want
to
get
gooned
on
good
euro
strong
beer
buy
an
okocim
mocne
leave
this
teutonic
urine
sample
on
the
shelf
appearance
cant
be
a
true
maibock
golden
tone
thin
white
head
disappears
in
seconds
lacing
yeah
right
aroma
touch
of
hallertau
grainy
sweetness
this
seems
disappointingly
bland
taste
alcohol
is
evident
and
overbearing
on
the
grainy
cloying
sweetness
malt
liquor
like
flavor
this
sucks
mouthfeel
thin
watery
undercarbonated
drinkability
wow
i
only
paid
about
a
dollar
for
it
the
date
was
good
i
had
to
pour
this
one
down
the
drain
it
was
horrible
not
the
best
of
holsten
this
is
just
a
bland
nothing
special
high
alcohol
beer
it
pours
out
a
very
light
amber
with
no
head
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
some
hops
alcohol
and
something
i
didnt
quite
get
nor
was
i
interested
enough
to
do
so
not
much
of
an
inviting
taste
sweet
malt
can
malt
be
sweet
the
other
holstens
are
better
from
a
500ml
can
with
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottom
and
the
ingredients
on
the
back
in
around
11
different
languages
its
a
clear
amber
colour
hardly
any
head
to
it
at
all
and
that
disappears
the
moment
you
blink
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
boozy
but
nothing
really
more
distinct
than
that
the
flavour
can
only
be
described
as
when
you
accidently
drink
la
fin
du
monde
out
of
the
bottle
and
even
that
is
being
very
generous
at
least
monde
has
some
character
either
way
the
farther
down
the
glass
i
go
why
am
i
doing
this
to
myself
the
more
cidery
it
starts
to
taste
i
would
actually
rather
drink
a
domestic
macro
than
this
stuff
clear
goldenorange
pour
the
head
fades
fast
not
much
is
detectable
in
the
nose
maybe
some
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
malty
on
the
way
down
with
an
odd
sweetness
again
maybe
caramel
but
not
distinct
also
seems
very
grainy
with
an
obvious
alcohol
finish
not
a
great
beer
as
far
as
maibocks
go
the
high
abv
is
very
evident
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
which
is
highly
malted
and
sweet
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
think
i
will
introduce
this
brew
to
my
sink
and
avoid
tomorrows
headache
i
could
see
drinking
a
lot
of
these
only
with
the
distinct
goal
of
getting
drunk
fast
its
like
sometimes
when
things
arent
happening
fast
enough
you
add
a
couple
of
these
to
the
mix
in
between
your
regular
5
beers
to
really
get
the
party
hopping
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
holsten
family
the
beer
poured
with
almost
no
head
at
all
and
looked
almost
flat
the
smell
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
first
initial
tastes
were
pretty
unimpressive
after
a
while
i
got
used
to
the
taste
to
me
this
just
seemed
like
an
average
beer

mouthfeel
that
is

is
well

with
minimal

after

overall
this
is
a
solid
maibock
style
good
complexity
and
balance
of
darkbready
malt
earthy
hops
and
fruity
ester
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
definitely
showed
some
signs
of
age
but
it
held
up
well
enough
and
was
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
maibock
simply
because
it
lacked
the
key
aspects
that
make
a
maibock
different
from
a
regular
bock
and
the
way
it
stands
i
found
this
beer
to
pretty
similar
to
a
dopplebock
its
not
bad
just
not
what
i
expected
or
wanted
at
the
moment
this
beer
had
a
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
a
little
sticky
rich
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
i
think
i
could
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
i
would
rather
split
it
with
someone
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
smooth
and
the
sweetness
wasnt
too
out
of
control
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
i
found
it
to
be
much
more
dopplebock
like
than
maibock
like
theres
no
way
i
would
be
able
to
guess
this
was
a
maibock
if
i
tried
it
blind
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
especially
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
maibock
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
good
maibock
simple
because
it
isnt
one
all
in
all
i
was
let
sown
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
maibock
and
instead
i
got
a
beer
that
was
very
close
to
being
a
dopplebock
and
it
just
wasnt
fulfilling
as
a
maibock
it
isnt
my
favorite
maibock
and
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
from
this
brewery
better
luck
next
time
guys
i
think
you
need
to
go
back
to
drawing
board
with
this
one
o
great
cannot
complain
about
that
at
all
body
is
more
than
medium
but
less
than
full
effervescence
is
lighter
somewhat
smooth
and
while
warming
to
an
extent
refreshing
as
well
this
is
a
really
good
beer
pours
a
firey
orangecaramelgolden
with
a
nice
white
head
and
constant
effervescence
a
nice
floral
honey
and
caramel
aroma
and
complimentary
flavor
a
creamy
active
body
to
this
overall
finding
that
i
might
be
warming
to
the
maibock
style
not
really
a
fcb
fan
but
did
enjoy
this
one
would
drink
again
though
might
not
be
rushing
to
the
gates
for
it

oak
aged
maibock
overall
a
good
sipping
beer
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
between
dinner
and
a
knick
game
very
enjoyable
im
not
a
bock
guy
and
im
loving
this
one
pours
a
clean
mahogonay
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
smells
like
a
barleywine
at
first
but
some
german
malts
happening
and
a
molasses
sweetness
flavor
is
a
grassy
springtime
vibe
meeting
an
octoberfest
head
on
malty
and
full
of
seasonal
life
i
am
impressed
with
the
complexity
here
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
just
a
touch
in
the
finish
a
little
boozy
as
well
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
suitable
to
the
beer
medium
to
fuller
bodied
and
long
lasting
at
the
end
this
beer
went

a

overall
everything
seems
in
line
with
the
way
the
style
should
be
compares
favorably
to
the
couple
other
examples
i
have
had
i
would
say
my
major
criticism
is
that
it
could
use
more
of
a
pronounced
hop
presence
o
nicely
drinkable
and
good
tasting
but
not
a
personal
favorite
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
need
to
drink
more
of
the
style
before
coming
back
to
this
3
5
dr
if
they
really
worked
on
this
this
could
be
a
fantastic
beer
i
think
they
used
puree
for
the
cherries
real
cherries
would
be
much
better
also
aging
in
cherry
wood
would
be
an
excellent
idea
quite
drinkable
and
with
some
good
flavours
the
above
average
alcohol
never
comes
through
d
id
have
this
one
again
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
balanced
read
bitterness
but
its
a
good
example
overall
overall
heavy
for
the
style
alcohol
is
light
but
present
overall
solid
beer
with
a
great
flavor
overall
an
excellent
beer
got
this
bomber
at
total

more
for

medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
hops
subtle
spice
and
sweet
malt
hints
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
some
caramel
nut
biscuit
and
toffee
slightly
toasted
but
not
burnt
just
enough
to
add
complexity
decently
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
not
bad
poured
into
a
wide
mouth
chalice
bright
copperamber
hue
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
yeastybreadymalts
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
caramel
even
a
burnt
grain
taste
evolves
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hop
presence
but
like
it
should
does
not
interfere
with
the
malt
the
body
is
big
full
malt
bomb
not
sure
of
the
alcohol
but
if
i
were
to
guess
i
would
say
around
6
the
site
here
says
6
3
but
not
on
the
label
in
fl
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
overall
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
fort
collins
they
are
truly
masters
of
all
bock
styles
they
have
this
down
pat
nicely
done
d
good
level
of
drinkability
and
just
right
for
the
start
of
spring
solid
by
example
fans
of
style
would
want
to
check
this
out
overall
a
great
beer
to
start
out
the
spring
season
with
not
sure
if
this
is
an
old
bottle
from
last
spring
was
on
the
shelves
of
a
reputable
store
no
dates
on
the
label
d
oh
how
i
wish
this
werent
retired
this
is
a
very
tasty
bock
overall
this
was
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
combined
with
the
slight
hoppiness
this
was
my
first
maibock
but
a
very
smooth
tasting
version
i
did
enjoy
this
version
and
look
forward
to
trying
different
versions
of
maibocks
the
aroma
is
malty
with
prune
and
fig
notes
sweet
but
not
cloying
sweet
maibock
sweet
and
of
course
caramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
caramel
up
front
with
a
nice
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
some
good
german
yeast
notes
in
the
background
not
overpowering
by
any
means
i
hate
too
much
yeast
taste
in
my
beers
medium
body
a
well
rounded
complex
brew
for
the
style
and
abv
so
much
going
on
really
enjoy
this
beer
more
and
more
wish
it
wasnt
almost
gone
thicker
tasting
than
it
looks
and
thicker
tasting
compared
to
most
maibocks
if
that
makes
sense
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
this
beer
worth
the
low
tag
and
worth
seeking
out
prost
drinks
pretty
easy
but
you
can
feel
the
abv
creeping
up
on
you
a
weak
sister
compared
to
prior
bock
offerings
from
fcb
shame
shame
on
on
you
i
think
i
see
why
thse
guys
arent
making
inroads
in
kansas
ok
or
mo
they
have
released
great
beers
then
got
chincywimpy
about
following
up
on
success
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
beer
hits
the
spot
when
looking
for
a
maibock
style
beer
drinkability
i
couldnt
find
a
listing
for
the
abv
but
what
ever
it
is
its
hidden
well
a
good
drinking
brew
for
me
and
one
that
id
be
happy
to
visit
again
and
i
had
to
set
aside
my
normal
review
to
style
route
this
one
was
just
too
tasty
to
give
it
bad
scores
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
maibock
as
it
does
not
really
seem
tostyle
more
like
a
normal
dark
bock
beer
than
anything
not
a
very
persuasive
or
compelling
offering
d
this
is
a
nice
maibock
overall
its
a
little
darker
than
i
was
expecting
for
this
style
but
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
aromas
and
flavor
a
nice
compliment
to
a
cool
spring
night
overall
a
decent
beer
from
a
new
brewery
for
me
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
regular
bock
than
a
maibock
still
it
was
pretty
decent
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
fairly
drinkable
the
maibock
style
is
my
favorite
lager
beer
and
i
always
look
forward
to
trying
new
ones
each
spring
poured

wow
a
killer
helles
bock
hereits
warming
and
rich
but
still
drinkableone
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
hell
yeah
overall
a
good
maibock
that
is
middle
of
the
pack
in
the
style
for
me
mild
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
rotation
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
my
co
trip
nn
great
beer
although
darker
than
any
maibock
ive
ever
had
and
against
the
common
standard
to
my
understanding
poured
with
a
medium
off
white
head
and
some
lace
color
is
mahoganey
aroma
is
malty
and
caramel
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
big
on
the
caramel
and
a
bit
of
bittlerness
in
middle
and
end
very
good
body
and
carbonation
super
easy
drinking
great
finish
session
beer
d
this
is
not
a
style
that
im
very
familiar
with
but
i
enjoyed
this
offering
quite
a
bit
a
tasty
maltcentric
brew
that
maintains
a
nice
balance
while
showcasing
some
nice
flavors
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
i
get
the
feeling
this
is
probably
trying
to
emulate
the
hofbrau
starkbier
as
its
darker
and
more
caramelcentric
than
any
other
maibock
around
still
its
doing
a
pretty
good
job
at
what
its
trying
to
do
edit
from
my
1st
review
i
served
this
beer
too
cold
and
that
killed
most
of
the
nosetaste
good
thing
i
bought
3
bottles
d
good
nice
sweet
malty
sessionable
treat
recommended
a
different
beer
for
sure
it
may
not
fit
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
a
little
different
for
the
style
its
a
decent
beer
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
them
but
i
dont
think
i
go
with
it
for
a
long
time
pours
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
creamy
tannish
head
very
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
prunes
figs
raisins
sweet
and
a
good
dose
of
caramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
some
good
caramel
tone
medium
body
a
well
rounded
complex
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
little
brew
from
ft
collins
highly
recommended
the
body
is
fairly
medium
to
full
with
a
strong
residual
caramel
sweetness
carbonation
is
fairly
gentle
could
stand
to
use
a
little
more
of
that
drinkability
is
good
would
make
a
great
pairing
with
a
desert
dish
while
at
first
i
was
surprised
at
how
dark
this
was
for
something
described
as
a
spring
bock
as
i
work
my
way
through
this
beer
it
becomes
clear
to
me
that
it
is
indeed
an
apt
title
the
beer
is
light
up
front
akin
to
the
promise
of
summer
but
still
rich
and
satiating
at
the
same
time
like
the
winter
just
passed
definitely
fits
nicely
as
a
spring
time
brew
it
has
all
the
malty
goodness
of
a
bock
yet
still
strikes
a
lightness
at
times
on
the
palate
that
makes
this
ever
so
quaffable
overall
an
excellent
maibock
i
dont
remember
tasting
any
diacetyllike
flavor
when
i
drank
the
first
bottle
straight
from
the
brewery
so
i
didnt
deduct
it
from
my
score
for
this
bottle
nonetheless
even
with
the
slight
buttered
corn
flavor
i
enjoyed
finishing
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
big
malty
body
fills
the
mouth
nicely
this
is
a
tasty
bock
that
will
satisfy
the
malt
craving
i
could
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
these
back
without
a
problem
yet
another
tasty
brew
from
the
folks
at
fort
collins
thanks
to
crosling
for
the
opportunity
overall
impression
very
nice
bock
definitely
a
liquid
bread
fort
collins
should
consider
making
this
one
for
wider
release
an
excellent
brew
most
delicious
fort
collins
brewing
has
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
if
youre
anywhere
along
the
front
range
this
spring
seasonal
is
a
must
get
great
beer
the
body
is
rich
and
medium
to
full
body
the
carbonation
is
light
but
and
works
for
the
stronger
amount
of
malt
overall
this
is
a
dark
miabock
with
a
stronger
malt
characteristic
but
a
good
unique
flavor
hooray
beer
im
not
sure
if
this
specific
bottle
came
from
zap
or
cokes
but
either
way
thanks
fellas
drinkability
scores
high
for
me
because
i
love
these
types
of
bocks
clean
tasting
sweet
but
not
overdonesomer
might
think
so
but
for
a
bock
i
think
it
is
fine
great
nose
again
what
a
find
this
was
shit
i
had
never
heard
of
fort
collins
brewery
until
i
found
this
and
another
of
their
offerings
in
eau
claire
bottle
obtained
in
early
july
2005
and
consumed
a
couple
days
later
pours
a
beige
two
finger
active
head
over
a
mildly
cloudy
light
brownred
liquid
smells
of
bock
munich
malt
mildly
chalky
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
wet
sweet
and
very
enticing
as
bock
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
tastes
wow
munich
malt
and
caramelly
delicious
not
quite
the
rounded
caramel
character
i
recall
when
drinking
bocks
over
in
germany
last
year
but
pretty
close
munich
malt
is
the
primary
flavor
that
persists
throughout
once
the
munich
is
established
caramel
rises
and
fades
as
well
as
a
flatness
like
that
of
bland
apple
meal
during
the
swallow
there
is
a
millisecond
of
gentle
alcohol
hot
accompanied
by
a
more
noticable
carbonation
release
plus
a
tang
catches
on
for
a
short
ride
but
then
fades
as
a
gentle
and
smooth
chocolatey
aftertaste
rises
while
wet
and
sweet
the
flat
of
my
tongue
has
a
string
from
miniscule
carbonation
and
my
mouth
is
dry
from
the
chalky
of
the
munich
malt
hop
bitter
is
low
such
that
i
cant
detect
any
underneat
the
carb
and
alcohol
stings
hops
flavor
is
very
mild
and
present
only
as
a
floral
aftertaste
in
the
back
of
my
throat
the
head
has
settled
to
islands
of
sticky
clogs
floating
on
the
surface
mediumthick
body
and
mildly
but
sharply
carbonated
get
rid
of
the
tang
in
the
aftertaste
and
this
is
a
really
nice
bock
and
to
think
i
was
pissed
when
i
realized
that
this
was
no
maibock
maple
creme
in
dark
chocolate
and
over
all
good
beer
for
the
style
when
i
think
of
bocks
i
dont
really
think
of
spring
it
had
a
very
dark
orange
color
much
like
rust
very
big
head
when
poured
huge
lace
like
a
white
carpet
there
was
a
very
thick
lager
taste
which
i
liked
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
them
bottle
says
it
aged
4
months
and
thats
what
it
tasted
like
a
little
thick
for
a
spring
or
summer
seasonal
but
still
not
bad
overall
i
thought
it
was
similar
to
their
marzen
but
not
quite
as
good
bangon

a
little
more
boring
than
other
maibocks

is

would
have
liked
a

beer
that
will

the

of
seasoned

fans
and
hobbyists
alike
give
it
a
go
i
was
surprised
of
how
much
malty
this
beer
was
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
a
respectful
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
better
maibocks
it
pours
a
slight
reddish
golden
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
it
smells
of
wonderful
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
nuts
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
to
round
out
the
taste
it
goes
down
smooth
although
i
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
afternoon
o
flavours
are
much
clearer
and
crisper
as
well
as
scents
than
dargunners
my
first
maibock
was
dargunners
really
am
privileged
to
find
a
beer
that
martin
luther
remarked
about
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
found
this
one
in
nashville
and
it
has
been
one
of
the
first
on
my
to
find
in
na
list
here
i
am
drinking
it
on
one
of
the
last
days
i
have
in
na
before
heading
to
china
first
heard
of
this
on
two
guys
on
beer
a
show
i
love
but
thats
no
longer
going
hey
not
what
i
was
expecting
if
you
are
ever
somehow
in
the
mood
for
a
maltweighty
honeyish
caramelbusty
german
beer
this
is
your
drink
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
low
amounts
of
carbonation
the
result
is
a
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
closes
semidryly
with
slight
lingering
stickiness
across
the
lips
browned
orange
filtered
with
a

so

taste
has
more

grainy

a
little
earthy
and
some
prominent
hop
bitterness
more
bruised
apple
type
flavours
medium
body
and
a
bit
of
bite
to
the
carb
just
another
maibock
really
nothing
to
see
here
pours
a
turbid
dark
orange
with
a
14
inch
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
forms
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
toast
caramel
and
some
slight
soy
sauce
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
toffee
and
some
alcohol
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
even
though
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
old
bottle
this
beer
is
known
as
a
beer
to
be
drunk
in
spring
its
pale
orange
in
colour
with
a
good
off
white
head
there
is
a
definite
toffee
malt
aroma
you
can
surely
get
hints
of
spice
malt
and
honeyish
tofee
it
does
have
a
hoppy
finish
which
i
enjoyed
loved
it
with
fried
fish
and
chips
overall
its
a
light
easily
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
malt
flavours
ive
got
nothing
against
it
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
either
very
traditional
maibock
here
this
beer
is
not
meant
to
knock
your
socks
off
it
is
an
extremely
tasty
easytodrink
beer
that
welcomes
the
spring
and
makes
you
happy
to
be
alive
o
this
is
a
very
solid
maibock
big
malty
flavors
and
aromas
and
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
malt
flavor
in
this
beer
this
is
definitely
not
a
bland
beer
while
i
thought
this
beer
was
enjoyable
there
are
a
couple
of
items
to
bring
it
more
into
style
increasing
the
bitterness
by
adding
additional
noble
hops
at
the
beginning
of
the
boil
would
help
in
increasing
the
bitterness
additionally
i
would
suggest
increasing
the
carbonation
as
this
beer
had
little
carbonation
and
moderate
to
moderatelyhigh
carbonation
is
needed
to
fit
in
this
style
the
dryness
kind
of
kills
the
mouthfeel
here
d
this
is
similar
to
the
hofbrau
maibock
deeper
amber
in
quality
with
a
higher
toffeeish
malt
balance
with
minimal
hop
note
if
i
hadnt
known
this
was
a
maibock
id
have
said
it
was
a
normal
bock
as
a
strong
malty
lager
its
very
good
grading
to
style
perhaps
not
a
classic
maibock
nevertheless
a
very
tasty
bock
o
a
good
beer
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
because
it
simply
isnt
really
my
thing
but
it
is
a
good
beer
actually
i
would
probably
buy
dead
guy
over
this
brew
that
beer
has
more
hop
flavor
and
simply
more
character
than
this
it
was
strongly
recommended
to
me
by
the
owner
of
the
beer
shop
where
i
bought
it
and
i
dont
regret
buying
it
but
i
wouldnt
strongly
recommend
it
odecent
beer
nothing
real
fancy
or
unique
but
has
standard
maibock
characteristics
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
maibock
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
typical
spring
bock
a
bit
more
spicy
than
the
others
in
the
style
which
makes
a
more
a
winterbeer
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
present
though
for
my
liking
like
ethanol
body
is
a
little
thin
and
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
still
its
good
and
improves
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
also
good
but
would
be
better
with
just
a
little
more
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
fizzy
at
first
and
its
a
little
thin
this
is
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
beer
that
has
some
nice
flavor
going
on
this
ones
an
orangered
color
with
a
tiny
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
for
style
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malts
this
ones
big
and
malty
plenty
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
breadiness
and
just
a
touch
of
booziness
and
sharp
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
spoton
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
about
average
for
the
style
overall
a
slightly
above
average
maibock
not
worth
seeking
out
but
not
a
bad
pickup
overall
definitely
the
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
sustenance
in
your
beer
overall
a
great
flavored
maibock
that
i
would
recommend
must
be
because
its
may
but
i
cant
get
enough
maibocks
right
now
so
why
not
go
with
where
the
style
started
tastes
like
it
smells
only
better
sweet
toffee
malts
fresh
bread
cereal
caramel
yeast
brown
sugar
candied
nuts
earthy
hops
adding
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
carbonation
is
dead
on
as
well
spritzy
and
effervescent
on
the
palate
creamy
in
the
middle
and
long
in
the
finish
cant
get
enough
an
easier
drinker
and
full
of
flavor
if
you
like
bocks
this
is
a
good
one
yes
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
with
this
beer
which
is
surprising
since
its
6
5
abv
but
i
really
think
this
alcohol
character
is
part
of
the
maibock
style
of
which
the
einbecker
is
among
the
best
ive
had
in
terms
of
flavor
drinkability
though
it
was
pretty
winterlike
for
april
today
it
felt
more
like
november
maiurbock
cheered
me
up
and
gave
me
a
much
needed
taste
of
spring
great
stuff
this
beer
poured
out
a
nice
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
definitely
resembled
a
true
german
brew
i
had
to
wait
to
finish
pouring
till
the
head
settled
a
bit
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
and
full
of
earth
or
nature
the
flavors
were
good
when
this
was
cold
from
the
fridge
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
just
got
nearly
unbearable
for
me
to
drink
i
dont
know
why
but
i
just
didnt
like
the
taste
of
it
after
midbottle
mouthfeel
was
good
and
all
just
the
taste
really
got
the
best
of
me
pours
a
moderatelydark
golden
color
with
a
longlasting
singlefinger
white
head
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
as
it
does
eventually
fall
the
nose
brings
some
light
grainy
malt
plus
a
very
faint
amount
of
herbal
hops
some
light
breadiness
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
slightly
bitter
and
grainy
with
the
finish
bringing
an
off
bitterness
that
is
almost
like
it
has
been
light
struck
thin
with
abovenormal
carbonation
as
well
not
terribly
drinkable
poured
into
a
wide
goblet
deep
copper
color
with
little
haze
the
head
is
tight
and
white
there
is
a
great
earthy
hop
aroma
up
front
the
other
characteristics
are
a
crisp
bitter
bite
and
nice
balance
of
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
close
to
moist
cake
the
body
is
full
but
refreshing
a
good
one
for
the
style
but
not
a
style
like
to
drink
everyday
urbock
eh
as
in
the
first
one
well
german
brewing
tradition
has
improved
upon
thatthis
first
maibock
but
the
og
version
still
holds
up
if
you
can
get
this
nonskunked
then
itll
be
even
better
iam
a
sucker
for
a
well
made
helles
bockthis
traditional
brewerys
rendition
was
a
bit
lackluster
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
becker
a
rich
lighter
bronze
shade

a
well
defined
one

are
a

not
alot

the
palatecaramel
sweetness
with
that
ironmineral
notea
light
herbaldry
hop
presence
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
but
again
not
overly
complex
it
was
so
easy
drinking
something
you
could
do
without
thinking
all
that
much
drinkability
at
6
5
abv
this
beer
could
sneak
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
i
like
this
as
well
or
better
than
most
of
the
german
beers
ive
tried
not
overpowered
with
hops
and
well
balanced
in
all
categories
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
one
evening
no
problem
d
this
was
probably
too
sweet
but
i
still
liked
it
quite
a
bit
more
than
other
maibocks
certainly
pretty
nice
beer
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
a
little
sweet
finish
is
creamy
and
nice
the
beer
fills
the
palate
out
well
with
a
balance
of
sweet
and
a
little
dryness
at
the
back
its
pretty
good
einbecker
makes
a
bunch
of
good
beers
drinkability
the
alcohol
could
be
better
hidden
but
still
a
nice
drink
for
a
session
goes
down
quite
smooth
and
crisp
this
beer
pours
an
attractive
dark
amber
and
has
notes
of
tree
bark
and
buckwheat
honey
in
the
smell
the
head
is
thin
honey
licorice
pine
needles
in
the
taste
very
well
balanced
drinks
exceptionally
easy
can
be
a
great
session
beer
goes
very
well
by
itself
or
with
traditional
german
foods
a
clear
winner
in
its
sort
d
a
real
good
maibock
in
a
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
though
the
sugar
does
tend
to
catch
up
with
me
by
the
end
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
german
effort
d
a
very
refreshing
maibock
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
like
the
aromas
lots
of
pear
and
apple
but
still
pretty
clean
i
was
interested
in
this
beer
because
it
is
fairly
difficult
to
find
in
my
area
so
i
purchased
a
6
of
it
it
has
great
carbonation
with
a
really
good
feel
however
mine
had
a
slight
rotten
smell
when
first
opening
it
luckily
the
rotten
smell
did
not
translate
into
a
rotten
taste
i
drank
this
beer
alone
with
no
food
and
think
that
it
would
be
great
with
simple
flavors
anything
too
complex
on
the
food
side
may
spoil
the
simplicity
of
the
beer
definitely
give
it
a
try
drinkability
i
dont
notice
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
in
this
beer
but
the
general
taste
is
fairly
pleasant
maybe
worth
coming
back
to
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
outside
on
a
spring
day
when
you
need
a
touch
of
alcohol
to
warm
you
up
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
but
does
not
detract
from
the
drinkability
a
smooth
and
quite
malty
lager
that
hits
the
spot
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
such
things
d
would
love
to
session
a
few
of
these
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
great
flavors
alittle
disappointed
i
have
liked
the
other
beers
from
these
germans
a
great
little
springtime
brew
that
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
seek
out
in
the
future
d
this
is
another
of
many
drinkable
enjoyable
anytime
german
beers
german
beer
is
good
its
the
law
one
always
looks
forward
to
the
spring
season
to
enjoy
a
great
maibock
einbecker
fills
that
desire
with
a
great
offering
big
malty
and
slightly
higher
abv
offering
is
sure
to
get
one
out
of
the
winter
season
and
ready
for
spring
very
enjoyable
offering
a
good
welldone
bock
nice
with
strong
hard
cheese
this
is
a
nice
maibock
that
isnt
overly
sweet
fairly
middle
of
the
road
mai
bock
but
im
not
that
familiar
with
the
style
enough
to
chew
on
anyway
d
the
sweetness
detracts
a
few
points
on
the
drinkability
scale
quite
a
good
one
and
a
pleasure
to
find
on
tap
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
floral
hoppy
and
a
little
bit
of
a
tomato
bitterness
body
is
light
and
lingers
on
the
palate
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
thick
full
bodied
and
grassy
hopped
than
i
was
expecting
the
beer
is
fairly
substantial
is
loaded
with
sweet
caramel
malts
some
abv
is
present
grassy
and
slightly
spiced
hop
and
a
touch
of
drying
presence
in
the
finish
there
is
a
slightly
perfumed
quality
to
this
beer
that
detracts
a
bit
this
is
a
decent
maibock
very
germanic
in
style
with
some
flaws
but
quite
characteristic
nevertheless
a
little
less
robust
and
less
flavorful
than
some
maibocks
ive
tried
before
overall
not
a
bad
beverage
taste
is
overall
similar
to
other
great
maibocks
strong
toasty
bread
toasted
golden
raisins
light
sweetness
with
light
spicy
and
faintly
herbal
bitterness
it
is
slightly
oily
its
a
good
maibock
one
of
the
more
subtle
but
drinkable
german
styles
cheers
pours
a
darker
golden
color
not
really
like
a
bock
heavy
caramel
malt
flavor
and
rather
hoppy
when
i
had
it
it
was
a
bit
skunked
so
it
probably
took
away
from
what
the
fresh
beer
tastes
like
has
a
dry
aftertaste
it
is
good
if
it
is
available
but
not
good
enough
to
go
out
and
search
for
it
d
pretty
good
but
sweetness
actually
gets
tiring
also
alcohol
becomes
increasingly
evident
throughout
easy
to
drink
but
drink
it
cold
as
this
one
warms
up
the
alcohol
takes
over
and
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
drinkability
id
love
to
sip
glass
after
glass
of
this
all
night
long
creamy
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
too
light
drinkable
as
well
my
perfect
pair
for
this
beer
would
be
cheeses
with
a
little
funk
like
washed
rind
cheeses
such
as
petit
munster
livarot
and
raclette
from
france
and
ardrahan
from
ireland
this
beer
can
handle
it
for
those
faint
of
heart
try
harder
cheeses
such
as
manchego
idiazabal
landaff
and
piave
pours
a
honey
golden
orange
color
very
sweet
nose
grainy
with
some
caramel
and
a
certain
mustiness
about
it
sweet
in
flavor
as
well
no
detectable
bitterness
to
my
tongue
lightmedium
in
body
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
still
went
down
very
easily
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
possibly
sessionable
for
the
true
bock
fan
decent
to
look
at
this
beer
was
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
on
the
nose
theres
a
rich
malty
character
with
caramel
sweetness
and
a
mild
hop
character
fairly
clean
though
there
was
a
distracting
metallic
character
on
the
palate
theres
sweet
and
malty
flavors
with
a
blend
of
honey
and
brown
sugar
not
very
complex
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decent
finish
with
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
definitely
not
among
the
better
beers
ive
had
of
late
the
german
decoction
mash
creates
the
depth
of
the
malts
in
this
beer
and
its
hops
are
top
quality
with
great
balance
great
ingredients
and
great
techniques
make
great
beers
d
not
very
complex
but
quite
tasty
the
alcohol
gets
a
little
too
much
after
a
while
and
considering
the
sweetness
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
on
any
occasion
this
style
of
beer
isnt
really
my
thing

this
is

until
the

hits
easy
to
get
tired
of
this
one
d
drinkability
is
good
but
could
be
better
i
imagine
this
brew
is
suffering
from
shelfstaleness
ill
see
about
finding
a
more
fresh
sample
to
update
overall
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
maibock
it
is
really
too
bad
that
ive
yet
to
find
any
american
craft
brewers
who
stand
up
to
the
germans
on
this
underappreciated
yet
very
enjoyable
style
of
beer
recommended
d
im
not
a
bock
fan
but
one
bottle
is
ok
and
the
alcohol
isnt
as
present
as
in
many
other
bocks
ive
had
d
less
hoppy
than
a
typical
maibock
i
think
but
it
holds
its
own
as
a
great
spring
beer
fairly
drinkable
delicious
overall
this
is
a
nice
malty
beer
though
it
seems
to
be
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
worth
a
shot
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
but
nothing
amazing
especially
if
its
the
orginal
maibock
its
almost
the
same
as
their
pils
aside
from
a
deeper
maltiness
im
glad
i
was
able
to
get
a
single
of
it
because
i
would
be
pissed
if
i
bought
on
of
the
14
99
six
packs
d
at
6
5
alcohol
you
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
which
i
did
for
this
review
however
in
my
area
a
6
pack
sells
for
14
which
i
feel
is
overpriced
especially
for
11
2
oz
bottles
i
have
tasted
better
and
cheaper
examples
of
this
style
another
generous
offering

the

nice
drinking
brew
i
havent
had
too
many
maiboks
but
i
found
this
brew
quite
flavorful
particularly
for
the
abv
a
nice
seasonal
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
11
2
ounce
green
bottle
i
bought
it
for
1
99
its
got
a
hazy
orange
appearance
and
a
moderate
offwhite
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
as
hell
it
smells
kind
of
like
a
chewy
carmel
candy
maybe
buttery
too
its
a
pretty
thick
and
chewy
beer
heavy
sweet
and
bitter
all
at
once
its
a
nice
contrast
of
flavors
all
in
one
beer
the
heaviness
and
alcohol
make
this
beer
one
that
youd
limit
consumption
on
twothenswitch
rule
applies
to
this
beer
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
the
style
ought
to
be
damn
good
light
body
but
smooth
with
spritzy
carbonation
d
a
very
drinkable
bock
despite
the
high
abv
and
the
obvious
presence
of
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
aroma
d
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
but
its
a
little
challenging
for
me
im
not
sure
if
i
too
much
like
the
idea
of
a
supedup
helles
but
overall
everything
works
together
fairly
balanced
flavor
especially
considering
the
relative
intensity
of
both
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
poured
into
a
pils
glass
for
a
light
gold
body
for
a
twofinger
head
that
left

wet
grassy
smell
with
hints
of
smoked
veggie
and
some
floral
notes
dryness
and
floral
hops
settle
in
with
a
citric
hop
taste
yet
there
are
also
sweet
malt
notes
like
caramel
and
other
sugariness
that
ride
right
along
with
it
this
is
a
thinner
lighter
bodied
beer
that
still
packs
a
good
taste
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
with
a
smooth
backbite
a
simple
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again

to

good
retention

this
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
some
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
toffeecaramel
sweetness
from
the
malt
that
is
cut
by
some
mild
hops
in
the
middle
that
gives
away
to
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
with
a
fair
amount
of
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
it
might
sit
a
little
heavy
to
have
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
i
doubt
i
would
have
another
drinkability
i
have
had
3
maibocks
that
i
gave
good
reviews
to
this
i
wasnt
too
crazy
about
it
had
to
much
hop
bite
and
not
enough
malt
tast
i
think
though
i
know
that
is
what
makes
it
a
mai
is
the
hops
full
flavored
im
in
for
one
or
two
though
the
intense
flavor
would
stop
me
there
d
this
is
a
very
good
maibock
i
had
passed
it
up
many
times
and
now
i
regret
it
glad
i
discovered
maibocks
an
okay
maibock
not
the
best
i
have
tried
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
lowering
the
drinkability
but
thats
about
par
for
the
style
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
poured
caramel
colored
with
a
decent
head
and
nice
laccing
has
a
very
malty
biscuity
aroma
to
start
which
turns
sweeter
almost
candied
smelling
with
some
spice
notes
finishes
bready
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
crisp
spices
bready
and
with
caramel
and
a
nutty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
spicy
and
crisp
very
nice
ontap
it
is
hard
to
pull
of
the
bready
richness
and
still
keep
everything
so
crisp
well
done
goes
down
too
quickly
maibocks
are
the
aledrinkers
lager
i
mean
the
flavor
is
unique
the
texture
is
wonderful
most
of
the
german
ones
are
superbly
brewed
its
just
a
nice
break
from
the
sweet
and
crazy
ales
many
of
us
concentrate
on
probably
not
for
everyone
though
would
be
freaking
amazing
with
brats
or
tofurkeys
awesome
vegan
beerbrats
if
you
swing
my
way
tasty
maltdriven
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
with
hints
of
amber
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
ring
fairly
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
smell
is
mainly
light
sweet
malts
and
grains
mainly
wheat
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
smell
with
sweet
malts
still
playing
the
major
role
but
with
a
more
interesting
things
going
on
behind
it
with
some
corn
and
some
faint
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
refreshing
with
good
carbonation
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
if
not
the
most
complex
of
maibocks
ive
tasted
d
not
a
bad
maibock
but
the
astringent
chracter
detracts
from
this
brew
somewhat
still
not
a
bad
offering
in
this
style
overall
this
was
an
interesting
brew
and
worth
a
try
d
a
good
drink
syrupy
sweet
and
fruity
and
all
you
can
ask
for
per
style
it
is
medium
bodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
12oz
green
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
translucent
golden
amber
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
shortlived
offwhite
head
caramel
and
biscuity
malts
shine
in
the
aroma
with
continental
hops
in
the
background
tastes
sweet
with
caramel
malt
playing
a
big
role
chocolate
notes
and
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
flavor
just
a
tinge
of
alcohol
warming
is
also
present
very
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
i
like
it
a
solid
german
lager
one
of
the
first
beers
i
got
on
my
summer
2008
trip
to
germany
was
stored
in
my
host
familys
cellar
during
a
fairly
hot
day
so
drank
it
warm
right
off
the
bat
smells
of
clean
german
hops
surrounded
by
a
munich
malt
aroma
i
dont
find
the
alcohol
taste
so
overwhelming
but
it
does
affect
its
drinkability
in
that
it
already
has
such
a
pronounced
sticky
sweet
malt
presence
and
then
you
realize
just
how
much
alcohol
youre
ingesting
as
well
overall
a
very
smooth
and
almost
sickenly
sweet
dessert
beer
i
enjoyed
the
2
i
had
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
go
much
beyond
that
md
crisp
mild
bitterness
but
lots
of
sweet
but
not
sugary
sweet
more
of
a
steady
sipper
than
a
gulper
einbecker
maiurbock
pours
a
medium
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
five
liter
mini
keg
the
aroma
is
very
malty
the
flavor
is
a
full
on
blast
of
malt
its
downright
bready
a
very
intense
beer
if
malt
is
your
thing
you
should
give
this
a
try
decent
stuff
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
definitely
more
understated
than
american
maibocks
although
the
ur
prefix
indicates
that
this
was
the
first
of
the
style
maybe
this
is
what
a
maibock
should
taste
like
d
this
is
an
excellent
brew
its
not
outrageously
complex
but
that
sweet
flavor
and
the
thick
honey
mouthfeel
are
awesome
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
brew
and
i
also
think
that
it
might
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
curious
bmc
drinkers
pours
a
really
nice
medium
amber
light
orange
color
with
great
clarity
and
a
half
inch
of
just
offwhite
head
aromas
like
an
amped
up
lager
with
a
big
dose
of
alcohol
slightly
sweet
candy
like
lightly
toasted
munich
malts
and
a
little
noble
hop
note
on
the
palate
starts
quite
grainy
with
a
dextrinous
feel
without
being
sweet
singular
malt
profile
finishing
bitter
and
semidry
hop
flavor
is
low
but
the
bitterness
certainly
lingers
along
with
a
warming
sensation
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
and
keeps
things
really
ramped
up
drinkability
if
you
enjoy
a
malty
brew
you
could
drink
this
all
day
i
sampled
this
beer
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
goldenbrown
color
smell
is
of
malt
did
i
mention
malt
has
some
spicy
hop
undertones
wow
the
flavor
is
great
definately
the
sweet
malt
you
expect
from
the
nose
with
a
slight
maple
flavor
maybe
even
some
butterscotch
notes
nice
bitter
hop
finish
this
is
a
great
tasting
bock
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
chewy
very
good
i
traditionally
like
extremely
hopped
ipas
but
this
malt
monster
is
very
good
and
i
will
definately
drink
many
more
in
the
future
d
an
easy
drinker
big
on
the
palate
but
a
reasonably
low
enough
abv
to
keep
things
from
getting
hairy
another
fine
addition
to
a
list
of
brews
to
get
again
although
im
sure
this
is
a
bit
past
its
peak
flavor
potential
especially
considering
the
rather
high
average
score
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
will
get
it
again
it
was
great
to
have
a
solid
lager
after
weeks
of
christmas
ales
this
is
my
first
goround
with
a
beer
of
this
sytle
and
it
certainly
wont
be
my
last
a
very
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
enjoyable
enough
definitely
a
high
quality
beer
well
worth
trying
this
beer
has
a
goldenamber
color
the
clarity
is
clear
it
has
a
malty
aroma
with
no
hop
notes
and
light
caramel
scent
the
flavor
is
caramel
notes
in
the
front
malty
it
has
a
body
that
is
between
medium
and
full
the
head
was
moderate
but
dissipated
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
sweet
but
not
cloy
beer
my
favorite
maibock
pours
a
lovely
copper
honey
color
with
a
thin
ecru
head
and
constant
upward
bubbles
smells
of
honeyed
malts
with
a
light
orange
blossom
fruitiness
and
a
fishy
sulphur
note
on
the
palate
appropriately
light
in
flavor
a
flash
of
balancing
hop
bitterness
hits
the
tongue
first
but
it
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
malts
which
somehow
maintain
the
balancing
act
of
tasting
sweet
and
feeling
dry
at
the
same
time
rich
and
delectable
but
still
light
on
the
palate
for
a
bock
this
is
one
of
the
better
maibocks
that
i
have
had
excellent
pours
out
an
orange
marmalade
with
almost
violently
active
bubbles
at
first
but
it
eventually
mellows
head
is
thinnish
spots
of
lace
lots
of
spicy
grassy
and
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
fine
malty
backbone
very
sweet
and
honeyish
aromas
flavor
starts
off
wonderfully
bready
with
dried
and
fresh
fruits
abounding
along
with
some
almonds
not
overly
sweet
and
actually
starts
to
dry
up
a
tad
in
the
end
herbal
and
floral
hops
come
in
at
the
finish
but
the
rough
bitterness
seems
a
tad
out
of
place
mouthfeel
is
solid
all
around
nice
round
body
and
some
punchy
carbonation
this
is
definitely
one
maibock
to
try
drinkability
is
decent
fans
of
moderately
hoppy
brews
will
take
a
liking
to
this
one
the
citrusy
notes
lend
to
a
hefeweizentype
taste
but
overall
this
is
defnitely
a
maibock
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
shaker
this
bock
poured
a
super
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
big
pillowy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
faded
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
lemony
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
darker
caramel
along
with
some
citrus
and
grass
also
a
hint
of
yeasty
bread
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
lightly
carbonated
very
good
balance
of
flavors
a
nice
one
amber
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
bready
malt
aroma
with
a
floral
hoppiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
this
is
a
malty
maibock
the
hops
provide
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
malt
sweetness
decent
balance
the
flavor
seems
to
become
more
bitter
as
it
warms
the
6
5
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
at
first
but
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
on
the
cooler
side
temperaturewise
as
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
at
first
but
the
beers
bitterness
seemed
to
become
a
little
less
inviting
as
it
warmed
to
room
temperatures
this
brew
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
and
white
lacing
is
thorough
and
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
grass
caramel
and
spearmint
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
more
grassy
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
maibocks
i
have
had
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
my
first
expectations
with
this
beer
was
very
low
but
then
i
heard
a
lot
of
praise
for
it
and
had
to
try
it
the
aroma
wasnt
that
interesting
but
the
taste
is
really
extraordinary
and
has
qualities
one
would
expect
from
a
beer
with
much
more
alcohol
according
to
style
guides
the
bitterness
seems
a
bit
high
but
hey
others
claim
this
is
the
original
bock
i
just
had
this
on
tap
at
orlando
brewing
i
am
astounded
at
how
great
this
beer
is
on
tap
ive
had
it
in
the
skunkygreenbottle
in
the
past
and
thought
it
sucked
however
this
ontap
beer
is
a
completely
different
animal
this
beer
rocks
why
does
germany
hate
the
usa
so
much
that
it
sends
us
so
many
crappy
greenskunked
bottled
beers
thankfully
germany
must
not
hate
us
all
that
much
since
the
us
also
gets
some
excellent
german
brew
on
tap
seek
this
stuff
out
on
tap
you
wont
be
sorry
aftertaste
is
dry
and
bitter
finishing
with
a
earthy
and
herbal
hop
touch
mouthfeel
is
velvet
smooth
the
small
gasbubbles
feel
really
nice
on
the
tongue
very
sweet
malty
presence
in
the
flavor
a
step
up
from
most
bocks
but
not
up
to
a
doppelbock
power
diacetyl
and
german
hops
round
out
the
flavor
sweet
finish
bready
and
chewy
also
notes
of
lighter
grain
as
well
6

is
fairly
evident
as
usual
with
the
bock
style
just
a
fullbodied
brew
enjoyable
bock
recommended
for
fans
of
german
styles
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
subtle
aromas
of
caramel
biscuits
and
toffee
with
some
light
floralvegetal
notes
taste
is
definitely
towards
the
sweet
and
malty
end
of
the
spectrum
starts
sweet
then
some
crispness
from
the
european
hops
in
the
background
and
the
lively
carbonation
mix
in
with
the
sweetness
without
taking
it
out
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
despite
the
relatively
high
abv
very
clean
flavors
as
to
be
expected
from
this
style
the
sweetness
could
become
cloying
after
a
while
along
with
the
slightly
higher
abv
this
makes
the
drinkability
suffer
a
bit
in
my
book
poured
vigorously
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
this
beer
begins
as
a
halfhead
halfbeer
mixture
up
to
the
top
the
aroma
instantly
pours
out
as
a
skunky
hopped
and
slightly
malty
beer
the
head
take
quite
a
while
to
settle
and
leaves
rocky
foamy
lacing
around
the
top
the
beer
is
a
reddish
gold
color
with
medium
foam
the
taste
is
surprisingly
malty
and
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
rich
this
is
like
a
bock
with
some
extra
hops
after
reading
the
definition
of
a
maibock
i
guess
it
fits
the
style
cool
this
wouldnt
be
a
session
beer
for
me
d
the
first
of
several
bocks
served
at
the
tasting
i
attended
this
maibock
from
einbecker
was
crisp
clean
and
satisfying
easy
to
drink
the
epitome
of
springtime
recommended
very
nice
appearance
and
headtypical
of
german
beers
transparent
and
fairly
light
color
for
a
bock
smell
is
wonderful
all
noble
hops
taste
is
lovely
sharp
crisp
hops
with
a
very
solid
balanced
malt
backbone
leaves
a
nice
clean
hop
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
great
beer
makes
me
long
for
good
ol
germany
this
was
a
nice
surprise
im
glad
i
gave
it
shot
opinion
as
i
started
to
mention
in
the
flavor
assessment
the
water
seems
to
be
better
suited
to
this
and
the
dunkel
ur
bock
the
pilsner
comes
across
a
bit
harsh
where
this
one
is
balanced
and
a
bit
hard
to
pin
down
as
it
should
be
i
think
that
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
maibock
and
it
is
one
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
as
the
opportunity
presents
itself
a
big
flavorful
maibock
just
smooth
enough
to
be
drinkable
while
tasty
a
tasty
maibock
even
now
in
december
although
this
65
degree
weather
seems
very
appropriate
and
makes
it
easy
to
enjoy
d
tasty
easy
drinking
not
filling
good
representation
of
style
this
beer
is
good
enough
to
pound
down
but
seems
more
like
a
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
finish
was
a
little
offdry
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
had
this
one
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
once
again
mark
gets
the
real
deal
on
draught
the
best
maubock
i
have
ever
tasted
appearance
was
a
nice
deep
cooper
color
the
aroma
was
all
about
the
malt
taste
breadlike
close
to
a
doppelbock
but
a
little
bit
more
balanced
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
with
pretty
low
carbonation
abv
is
well
concealed
so
you
can
down
a
bunch
but
be
careful
a
world
class
offering
from
einbecker
very
drinkable
with
a
good
firm
aftertaste
i
will
always
buy
some
if
i
see
it
on
my
travels
i
recommend
that
you
do
the
same
once
again
what
is
up
with
these
damn
green
bottles
it
really
shows
a
brewer
who
lacks
a
fundamental
respect
for
their
beer
if
it
were
not
for
the
skunked
hops
this
would
be
an
incredibly
nice
bock
it
is
still
quite
good
though
a
smooth
delicious
brew
from
start
to
finish
a
classic
of
the
style
12oz
bottle
poured
a
beautiful
clear
light
amber
with
orange
tones
decent
size
offwhite
head
smell
was
mainly
malt
caramel
and
molasses
some
hops
of
the
citrus
variety
came
through
rather
faintly
the
taste
was
sweet
at
the
start
but
less
so
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
expect
as
you
hold
the
beer
you
get
alcoholphenolmedicine
taste
in
the
middle
sprinkled
throughout
are
notes
of
toast
not
quite
burnt
the
finish
brings
the
hops
gently
and
a
slight
pepper
taste
body
was
medium
as
was
the
carbonation
the
finish
was
drying
almost
to
the
point
of
being
astringent
and
there
was
some
alcohol
warming
going
on
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
but
not
really
to
my
taste
the
alcoholmedicinal
flavor
really
did
nothing
for
the
total
experience
i
loved
the
vibrant
bronze
color
of
the
pour
the
head
looked
a
little
like
a
buzzcut
short
and
to
the
point
nose
is
sugary
caramel
toffee
taste
is
almost
identical
but
sadly
the
hops
do
not
come
out
to
play
at
all
mouth
is
rich
and
creamy
putting
a
smile
on
my
face
im
in
no
hurry
to
drink
this
again
though
too
many
other
beers
call
my
name
in
this
too
short
life
pours
a
bubbly
and
crisp
looking
amber
almost
light
brown
but
clear
coonstant
bubbling
and
a
constant
foam
the
smell
was
of
like
sweet
and
toasty
malt
with
a
hint
of
spring
grass
and
dew
flavor
has
a
light
hint
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
mixed
with
some
yams
believe
it
or
not
then
of
course
a
clear
barley
grain
texture
if
you
like
malty
bocks
with
good
abvs
then
this
beer
is
for
you
first
thought
green
bottle
and
for
a
helles
well
my
fears
seemed
confirmed
from
a
skunky
smell
a
good
head
otherwise
average
appearance
luckily
the
rest
of
this
beer
is
well
above
average
an
extremely
aggressive
taste
slightly
overwhelming
dry
but
pronounced
a
crazy
malt
backbone
abrupt
malt
aggression
but
still
even
for
a
helles
bock
there
is
a
certain
softness
sounds
contradicting
i
know
but
a
fantastic
blend
also
an
underlying
bitterness
and
great
maltyness
that
sticks
with
you
in
a
very
pleasant
fashion
poured
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
moderate
white
head
that
slowly
fell
to
a
thin
coating
smell
is
very
light
with
a
slight
wsweet
maltiness
present
taste
is
firmly
maltly
with
an
alcohol
presence
also
noted
taste
rapidly
rapidly
dissapears
leaving
only
a
vague
alcohol
taste
maybe
a
bit
of
dryness
at
the
finish
average
at
beast
there
are
much
better
examples
to
be
found
a
nice
malty
aroma
that
gives
a
small
whiff
of
alcohol
there
are
also
notes
of
a
czech
pilsner
with
some
spicy
hop
notes
detected
there
also
pours
a
beautiful
light
copper
color
that
gives
orange
hues
when
held
to
the
light
a
small
head
forms
but
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lace
a
good
dose
of
hops
bitterness
hits
the
palate
first
then
gives
way
to
the
malt
towards
the
finish
a
good
froth
in
the
mouth
brings
the
true
bock
to
the
forefront
and
the
malty
backbone
is
much
more
present
surprisingly
i
got
a
taste
of
tea
or
tannins
that
fit
nicely
with
the
malty
sweetness
almost
a
tamer
version
of
urbock
23
and
a
touch
more
drinkable
poured
a
translucent
copper
color
with
a
strong
white
colored
head
the
surface
was
covered
in
bubbles
and
a
touch
of
lacing
was
left
behind
in
my
glass
aroams
of
malt
dried
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
a
cross
between
malt
liquor
and
a
doppelbock
with
grainbread
unertones
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
to
really
enjoy
again
and
again
nice
texture
with
the
heavy
carbonation
but
less
than
average
drinkability
an
enjoyable
beer
but
some
slightly
off
flavors
balance
suffers
a
little
from
the
grainy
finish
but
the
big
innitial
malt
palate
is
nice
prost
mk
almost
heavy
malty
exactly
like
a
maibock
should
be
like
on
the
other
hand
this
is
the
maibock
crux
einbecker
maiurbock
good
shit
by
any
standard
this
really
is
a
good
beer
and
i
cant
believe
i
havent
had
it
before
now
the
stubby
bottle
belies
and
comports
a
sophisticated
brew
and
one
i
shall
return
to
when
the
mood
strikes
the
craft
and
skill
that
went
into
creating
this
brew
is
obvious
recommended
you
cannot
complain
with
this
one
last
reviewer
said
its
a
little
skunky
outta
the
bottle
that
is
accurate
and
is
in
no
way
reflective
of
the
way
this
nice
maibock
tastes
very
hoppy
on
the
backend
nice
and
malty
on
the
front
nice
fruity
esthers
with
the
only
actual
german
maibock
ive
had
that
is
better
being
hofbraus
drinkability
not
sure
this
style
is
for
me
but
it
wasnt
bad
need
to
try
more
to
appreciate
this
style
i
guess
thanks
to
redbaron
for
the
sample
the
body
is
medium
with
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
it
may
be
6
5
but
it
still
seems
to
pack
a
bit
of
a
punch
still
quite
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
more
maibocks
coming
out
this
spring
props
to
mabz
for
including
4
of
these
with
a
couple
of
gose
in
a
trade
for
two
of
averys
the
beast
grand
cru
sorry
the
beast
killed
your
tongue
i
found
this
gritty
enough
to
work
for
a
high
malt
brew
and
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
again
and
again
when
available
medium
bodied
carbonation
was
active
small
11oz
green
bottle
pours
an
orangestraw
color
with
big
fluffy
head
lots
of
malt
and
some
moderate
noble
hop
aroma
full
body
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
and
alchoholic
finish
taste
is
malty
and
rich
but
the
very
dry
mouthfeel
has
a
kind
of
metallic
aftertaste
this
beer
wanted
to
taste
really
good
but
for
some
reason
it
was
off
maybe
it
was
past
its
prime
or
due
to
the
green
bottle
was
a
bit
light
struck
a
very
nice
bock
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
could
be
better
definately
will
give
this
one
another
try
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
guess
i
expected
something
a
bit
more
spectacular
but
it
is
certainly
nothing
to
pass
up
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
my
first
maibock
ah
the
memories
so
so
smooth
deep
rich
bronze
color
with
apleasant
texture
that
just
lingers
on
the
tounge
you
know
even
for
traveling
half
way
around
the
world
and
being
out
of
season
it
was
mid
winter
this
may
quite
possibly
be
the
best
bottled
beer
ive
ever
had
and
its
the
original
from
the
last
of
the
great
einbecker
breweries
likely
the
best
mailbock
ive
had
poured
out
to
a
medium
orange
color
with
a
full
white
foamy
head
no
lacing
noted
medium
level
of
carbonation
initial
aroma
is
very
skunky
but
a
second
sniff
brings
forth
the
real
smells
fresh
grass
and
mild
malt
mixed
with
a
ghost
hoppiness
taste
is
a
welcome
suprise
from
what
i
was
expecting
after
the
smell
lots
of
sweet
malt
some
grain
and
hops
with
an
overall
fresh
cut
grass
character
nice
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
almost
slick
good
drinkability
this
would
be
even
better
on
tap
i
bet
or
at
least
in
a
bottle
that
isnt
green
recommended
serves
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
big
pillowy
head
that
lasts
this
beer
is
big
and
malty
like
a
bock
should
be
very
clean
with
a
slight
toastiness
to
offset
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
just
enough
hop
to
offset
the
sweetness
as
well
its
so
smooth
you
may
not
notice
the
considerable
alcoholic
strength
at
first
but
after
a
few
youll
have
no
problem
recognizing
it
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
drinkability
what
should
be
really
malty
and
sweet
is
more
bitter
and
perfumey
even
medicinelike
not
going
to
wake
up
and
crave
this
beer
einbecker
maiurbock
is
decent
if
you
like
this
style
though
i
suggest
you
seek
someone
elses
opinion
of
its
worthiness
someone
who
enjoys
and
appreciates
maibockshelles
bocks
more
than
i
do
just
about
anyone
will
do
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
this
one
but
im
still
learning
as
far
as
the
subtle
german
beers
go
not
sure
how
old
this
one
was
i
think
it
was
from
this
may
poured
a
dark
amber
transparent
not
too
much
carbonation
difficult
initially
to
get
a
head
but
quickly
errupted
in
a
halfcreamy
halfrocky
one
smell
was
mostly
strong
grassy
hops
just
a
hint
of
caramel
very
sweet
taste
a
bit
of
honey
but
a
great
deal
of
refreshing
hop
bite
smell
faded
for
me
quickly
not
too
complex
just
sweet
and
refreshing
a
little
caramel
or
toffee
mediumweak
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
hard
to
compare
to
others
so
a
bit
hard
to
review
for
the
style
a
truely
awesome
brew
we
have
here
i
poured
it
in
an
oversized
thin
red
wine
glass
which
emphasized
its
hazy
figure
and
copper
hue
delicious
in
every
regard
some
think
caramel
and
some
think
honey
but
id
say
a
combination
of
both
to
achieve
a
supremely
balanced
malty
sweetness
i
expected
more
of
that
signature
german
skunk
quality
which
ive
grown
to
like
in
a
way
but
this
had
very
little
very
drinkable
and
very
simply
good
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
prost
beertracker
this
beer
is
a
nice
amberorange
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
ring
after
a
few
sips
smells
like
caramel
and
freshly
milled
malted
barley
with
a
touch
of
orange
and
fig
the
taste
is
quite
extraordinary
sweet
grains
leap
out
at
you
coated
with
caramel
and
rolled
in
candied
pecans
a
slight
bubblgum
fruitiness
greets
you
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
bitter
drying
and
somewhat
chalky
enough
to
keep
this
from
being
cloying
some
spicy
saaz
or
other
german
varietal
comes
back
in
the
burps
mouthfeel
is
as
smooth
as
can
be
and
drinkability
is
excellent
there
are
a
couple
of
other
maibocks
i
like
better
because
they
have
a
bit
more
bitterness
but
this
is
a
fine
fine
example
taste
is
rich
caramel
malt
very
malty
and
lightly
fruity
nice
hoppy
bite
for
balance
in
the
finish
mouth
is
lightly
sticky

really
refreshing
at
the
same
time
oh
so
tasty
a
pleasant
surprise
a
mediumbodied
brew
that
i
found
very
drinkable
and
i
highly
recommend
this
rare
style
to
anyone
who
comes
across
it
pleasant
and
might
order
another
although
with
the
large
tap
selection
i
moved
along
a
nice
beer
in
a
neat
little
bottle
that
reminds
me
of
a
brew
kettle
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
with
a
persistent
white
head
the
aroma
starts
out
with
minerals
up
front
then
fades
away
with
bready
malt
hinting
at
nutty
munich
malt
and
a
little
fruity
yeast
in
the
background
little
to
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
clean
malt
bready
to
caramel
to
nutty
then
a
lingering
sweet
finish
the
beer
has
a
nice
body
and
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
which
isnt
too
intrusive
overall
this
was
a
great
maibock
and
one
ill
look
for
in
stores
a
very
balanced
example
of
this
style
compared
to
others
i
have
sampled
that
are
too
alcoholic
or
have
nothing
to
balance
out
the
malt
all
in
all
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
recommended
330
ml
bottles
now
available
in
norway
vinmonopolet
bestillingsutvalget
i
drank
the
first
bottle
at
cellar
temperature
the
second
one
at
fridge
temp
extremely
powerful
mouthfeel
in
both
cases
youd
think
the
beer
was
much
stronger
than
its
6
5
abv
in
a
blind
test
id
probably
say
1011
this
means
that
the
alcohol
dominates
but
the
malts
and
hops
are
evident
too
colour
is
deep
golden
amber
large
white
head
moderate
aroma
of
spices
caramel
molasses
and
hops
some
oak
and
leather
too
moderately
sweet
with
a
dry
and
bitter
hoppy
finish
i
preferred
the
einbecker
urbock
dunkel
to
this
one
the
color
is
honey
amber
with
a
very
good
head
the
aroma
is
straightfoward
all
inviting
caramel
malts
the
primary
taste
here
is
caramel
malt
which
is
backed
up
with
a
hop
bite
and
herbal
flavors
herbal
taste
is
most
pronounced
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
high
this
is
very
tasty
and
almost
addictive
sadly
this
is
the
only
true
german
maibock
ive
seen
in
the
us
i
would
really
like
to
try
a
bunch
of
different
beers
in
this
style
for
comparison
i
was
excited
to
try
this
brew
and
it
did
not
let
me
down
its
real
strength
is
the
smell
though
its
taste
was
wonderful
as
well
crystal
clear
bronze
color
visible
carbonation
streams
grassy
malts
in
the
nose
earthy
and
lightly
hopped
taste
is
full
and
thick
with
grassy
malt
and
alcohol
with
a
sharp
shot
of
hops
on
the
backside
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
carbonated
only
as
well
as
it
neeeds
to
be
i
like
this
beer
a
good
maibock
with
a
european
flavor
that
i
havent
seen
from
a
maibock
before
this
is
my
kind
of
session
beer
malty
clean
unintrusive
and
friendly
this
could
easily
be
my
trusty
companion
while
slaving
over
the
charcoal
weber
this
spring
would
love
to
have
this
along
side
of
a
german
sausage
platter
yum
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
fruity
dry
yeast
aroma
it
is
sweet
and
creamy
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
strong
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
bisquit
malts
it
has
a
sweet
yet
breadlike
taste
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
earthy
and
dry
with
a
slight
skunkiness
this
is
an
odd
taste
but
i
like
the
idea
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
warmth
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
has
real
malt
character
and
a
style
all
its
own
a
good
drinker
very
clear
gold
to
amber
colored
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settled
quickly
in
the
beer
the
aroma
has
a
strong
crisp
hop
character
hallertau
with
a
backbone
of
malt
the
malt
lends
a
toffee
character
to
the
nose
very
crisp
taste
caught
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
definitely
lager
style
hops
lend
this
to
the
flavor
a
richness
and
a
delicate
sweetness
follows
this
is
certainly
a
crisp
maibock
nice
lace
left
down
the
glass
as
i
sip
the
beer
very
good
balance
of
crisp
lager
character
and
bock
sweetness
as
you
would
expect
a
very
taught
mouth
feel
good
drinkability
a
decent
though
not
exceptional
brew
any
timesmooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
crisp
tingling
tongue
golden
yellow
and
a
white
tan
lace
and
initially
very
creamy
pour
a
warm
weather
ale
and
with
11
degrees
on
january
1st
that
was
fine
i
loved
this
beer
and
will
try
and
keep
a
few
on
hand
whenever
i
can
drinkability

this
is
a
big
but
simple
hearty
bock
its
almond
beer
i
have
had
beer
that
tastes
like
but
was
not
made
with
blueberries
old
foghorn
on
tap
oranges
thomas
hardy
grapefruit
any
one
of
a
number
of
sierras
etc
but
this
is
my
first
almond
surprise
it
meets
my
mark
of
welcome
surprise
you
keep
on
drinking
it
to
continually
retest
your
hypothesis
hmm
i
think
lucky
me
was
able
to
sip
this
one
fresh
off
the
boat
it
sure
tasted
that
way
i
had
three
of
these
and
looking
at
the
abv
yeah
thats
about
right
had
this
one
at
bones
last
evening
and
it
was
yummy
heard
we
werent
supposed
to
use
that
adjective
so
get
ready
to
see
it
a
lot
from
now
on
the
color
was
munich
amber
go
look
see
what
that
could
be
topped
with
a
frothy
tan
head
nice
pour
i
even
had
rings
of
lace
left
throughout
my
glass
the
light
brown
bready
aroma
was
pleasant
tingly
carbonation
was
the
initial
impression
and
the
malt
was
slightly
sweet
which
was
nicely
kept
in
check
by
the
crispness
of
the
carbonation
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
but
again
no
syrupy
notes
detected
either
spot
on
and
a
bit
dangerous
for
me
having
three
very
very
good
the
beer
is
a
pretty
pale
orangegolden
color
and
has
a
nice
lush
offwhite
head
that
sends
a
thin
sheet
of
belgian
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
falls
the
head
is
very
rocky
as
well
a
good
sign
the
aroma
is
a
nice
solid
malt
almost
candy
like
with
a
faint
hint
of
hops
this
one
has
a
touch
of
skunkiness
its
in
a
green
bottle
i
still
dont
understand
why
they
do
that
anyway
it
isnt
too
bad
so
i
rush
in
and
take
a
sip
i
get
a
full
strong
maltiness
that
is
balanced
with
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
and
a
good
bitterness
to
keep
the
malty
sweetness
in
check
i
get
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
as
well
but
thats
pretty
much
it
the
beer
alcohol
level
6
5
by
volume
seems
pretty
well
hidden
awesome
this
one
poured
a
lot
lighter
than
i
expected
sort
of
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
soon
dissapates
to
nothing
but
a
fine
covering
smelled
a
little
bit
light
struck
but
there
was
a
sweet
malty
aroma
as
well
very
sweet
on
the
initial
taste
but
a
little
bit
of
spice
is
present
as
the
brew
warms
to
room
temp
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
is
noticable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
might
revisit
this
sometime
in
the
future
but
nothing
is
compelling
me
to
buy
anymore
of
this
at
the
moment
a
good
stronger
german
beer
gutsy
level
of
hoping
results
in
a
noticeably
different
beer
from
germany
pours
nice
rich
gold
with
creamy
offwhite
head
german
hop
nose
along
with
some
munich
malt
sweet
up
front
in
the
mouth
followed
by
some
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
pleasant
firm
bitterness
followed
by
an
almost
lactosweet
fruity
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
from
rough
carbonation
good
body
one
of
the
great
maibocks
right
up
there
with
hofbrau
and
ramstein
yes
ramstein
poured
a
deep
gold
beer
witha
finger
thick
white
head
which
subsided
quickly
aroma
was
of
light
toasty
malt
flavors
that
finished
dry
the
flavor
began
with
a
noble
hop
bitterness
which
was
completly
covered
up
with
malt
flavor
soon
after
a
clean
dry
light
malt
flavor
is
the
predominent
character
of
this
beers
flavor
the
finish
is
full
of
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
reminds
one
of
a
fien
german
pils
body
is
medium
wieh
a
bit
of
a
carbonic
bite
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
brew
as
it
seemed
more
like
an
out
of
balance
pils
that
a
smooth
bock
a
bit
too
much
hop
for
rhe
style
and
too
light
on
the
malt
flavors
as
well
it
is
hard
to
criticize
this
beer
as
einbeck
is
wherer
the
bock
style
originated
but
i
believe
that
this
beer
is
not
a
perfect
pale
bock
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
good
caramel
base
just
a
touch
of
hops
present
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
coming
through
a
toffee
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
and
thick
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
for
6
5
a
decent
maibock
a
medium
bodied
beer
of
good
complexity
very
drinkable
oy
vey
was
it
ever
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyable
probably
my
2nd
favorite
maibock
of
the
season
after
penns
fantastic
offering
a
nice
hop
presence
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
after
the
super
honeysweet
offerings
of
most
others
quite
good
and
certainly
one
that
ill
have
again
the
beer
after
separating
from
the
12
ounce
green
bottle
set
in
the
glass
a
translucent
deep
gold
color
the
head
is
portly
in
size
the
texture
semicreamy
and
the
color
a
very
light
tan
white
with
the
residual
lace
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
to
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
fresh
and
crisp
to
the
senses
start
is
ambrosial
nice
malt
presence
the
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
brisk
acidity
with
a
mild
hops
presence
very
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
nice
mild
and
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
nicely
drinkable
the
occasional
euroskunk
aromas
probably
result
from
the
end
bottles
in
the
six
pack
being
lightstruck
in
their
green
glass
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
this
is
a
beer
thats
worth
trying
at
least
once
and
it
might
surprise
the
taster
not
a
top
50
beer
by
any
stretch
but
good
enough
that
its
a
decent
choice
if
youre
at
your
favorite
beer
store
and
having
trouble
deciding
what
to
get
this
beer
sure
looks
nice
a
deep
caramel
tinged
golden
with
an
attractive
just
off
white
head
is
accented
by
lace
that
kind
of
just
sits
there
looking
pretty
aromas
are
deeply
malty
with
some
residual
sweetness
this
is
a
mouthfull
of
beer
chewy
in
texture
it
is
perhaps
a
tad
syrupy
and
somewhat
cloying
but
a
very
distinct
hop
bitter
is
on
hand
throughout
and
evens
things
out
to
some
degree
the
beer
went
very
well
with
homeade
pretzels
on
its
own
without
food
though
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
be
happy
with
just
one
the
aroma
sucked
but
perhaps
it
was
a
bit
skunked
otherwise
it
was
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
im
turning
into
a
hophead
so
id
prefer
something
with
hops
but
this
brew
is
very
well
refined
for
the
style
i
will
ding
this
beer
for
the
smell
right
now
ill
have
to
try
it
again
but
the
smell
is
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
on
the
whole
this
is
not
a
great
standout
beer
but
a
drinkable
one
nonetheless
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
leaves
no
yeast
residues
in
the
green
0
33
liter
bottle
drinkability
doesnt
show
the
8
5
abv
at
all
very
drinkable
chill
hazed
pale
golden
yellow
in
color
thin
whitish
head
not
withstanding
any
staying
power
thin
collar
remains
and
very
minimal
whispy
strings
of
lace
stick
aroma
has
a
sweetish
bread
malt
tone
thats
sort
of
pale
or
dull
a
bit
candyish
too
in
its
sweetness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
mild
subdued
presense
of
pale
sweetness
lightly
breadish
a
bit
of
an
acute
bittering
with
a
slight
herbalness
to
its
hops
pleasingly
mild
taste
feel
is
about
medium
bodied
with
a
light
frothy
texture
and
finish
that
ends
a
bit
dry
a
reserved
in
pale
sweetness
overall
with
this
maibock
makes
it
a
bit
bland
but
its
actully
quite
tasty
and
becomes
better
as
it
warms
where
some
of
the
breadish
tones
float
in
more
drinkability
was
high
but
probably
dangerous
given
relatively
high
abv
i
dont
reviews
beers
often
but
this
beer
is
not
bad
pours
a
nice
head
but
shortlived
head
has
a
nice
malty
if
thats
a
word
smell
a
nice
smooth
flavor
only
a
11
2
oz
bottle
but
at
6
5
kick
your
butt
you
can
drink
more
then
one
of
these
and
it
is
worthwhile
getting
a
few
bottles
when
available
this
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
basically
no
head
but
left
lots
of
lace
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
pale
malt
and
i
couldnt
detect
much
else
the
flavor
in
this
beer
comes
out
and
attacks
your
tastebuds
it
is
intense
at
first
it
threw
me
off
but
i
really
began
to
like
this
one
once
i
got
used
to
it
i
can
definietly
tell
this
is
a
german
beer
with
the
german
malts
and
it
seemed
yeasty
earthy
hops
are
strong
too
but
not
too
bitter
a
strong
beer
that
will
kick
your
taste
buds
ass
pours
a
solid
off
white
head
that
holds
up
pretty
well
hazy
light
amber
in
color
the
aroma
is
a
mildly
malty
and
just
a
little
sweet
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
taste
is
held
in
check
by
smooth
spicy
hoppiness
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
and
alcoholic
an
interesting
mildly
strong
beer
definitely
a
good
beer
for
a
lounging
around
on
a
cool
sunny
breezy
day
drinkability
crisper
than
the
big
malt
taste
and
feel
would
suggest
very
drinkable
and
consistent
straight
marks
a
nice
bock
overall
impression
was
hoping
to
educate
myself
about
the
maibock
style
with
this
but
never
really
got
a
feel
for
the
style
seemed
like
any
other
lager
ill
keep
looking
it
did
hide
the
alcohol
well
poured
with
a
pale
orangy
color
with
a
nice
thick
dense
head
spicy
hop
aroma
or
maybe
a
little
skunky
because
of
teh
green
bottle
sweet
maltyness
is
poking
through
in
the
background
very
smooth
balanced
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
to
cut
through
the
malt
in
the
aftertaste
excellent
beer
definetly
worth
trying
again
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
very
active
carbonation
aromas
are
sweet
caramel
and
grassy
first
sip
is
grassy
with
a
slight
metallic
finish
metal
fades
and
gives
way
to
a
balanced
grain
profile
and
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
this
was
a
medium
bodied
pale
bock
with
a
moderate
drinkability
light
straw
colored
bock
with
lots
of
hops
seemed
odd
for
a
mai
bock
it
is
very
floral
and
has
a
nice
appearance
with
good
carbonation
and
some
malt
in
the
finish
it
is
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
thse
who
enjoy
hoppy
bocks
mouthfeel
is
good
just
the
flavor
had
me
shocked
with
the
hoppiness
skunky
nose
to
start
and
remains
throughout
green
bottles
may
be
the
culprit
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
with
this
brew
it
was
crisp
and
tingly
the
bready
malt
flavor
really
overpowered
any
chance
of
a
nice
hop
flavor
to
this
brew
it
was
definitely
a
good
beer
and
was
very
drinkable
but
it
was
not
what
i
wanted
definitely
a
much
different
brew
than
other
maibocks
sampled
to
date
cheers
sweet
malt
aroma
with
german
hops
wafting
up
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
and
alcohol
hops
play
a
supporting
role
adequate
but
always
at
the
back
of
the
stage
malt
takes
the
spotlight
with
some
herbal
sweetness
alcohol
flavors
are
just
one
step
behind
wrestling
with
the
hops
for
second
stage
my
bottle
was
about
7
months
beyond
the
best
before
date
didnt
think
to
check
until
i
got
got
home
but
the
beer
seems
to
have
held
up
well
no
oxidized
or
sulfur
flavors
even
in
a
green
bottle
drinkability
high
this
beer
has
more
drinkability
that
its
score
would
lead
you
to
imagine
the
sweetness
brings
the
glass
back
to
my
lips
initially
this
brew
comes
across
as
a
tad
unruly
with
alcohol
the
dominant
presence
both
in
aroma
and
taste
by
the
second
third
and
forth
gulp
the
hops
begin
to
assert
themselves
and
take
center
stage
the
amberorange
color
stands
alone
in
the
beer
world
i
had
to
keep
looking
at
it
and
holding
it
to
different
lights
and
upgrading
my
initial
appearance
rating
the
taste
is
extremely
complex
that
too
required
a
raise
in
points
the
ample
malt
body
never
achieves
a
platform
of
its
own
it
instead
plays
a
wonderful
supporting
role
to
the
competing
stars
the
off
white
heads
performance
is
marvelous
though
brief
einbecker
by
the
way
is
the
inventor
of
the
bock
style
because
i
was
unsure
of
my
ability
to
accurately
rate
this
unusual
style
beer
with
one
bottle
i
found
it
necessary
drink
a
second
a
hefty
brew
for
sure
but
not
among
my
maibock
favorites
even
considering
this
bottle
was
clearly
past
its
prime
i
never
had
a
bock
with
so
much
structure
an
average
beer
thin
white
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
quite
good
malty
taste
very
nice
body
in
deep
copper
color
quite
acceptable
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
if
you
get
the
chance
try
it
einbecker
urbock
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
where
it
is
the
beer
of
the
month
3
00
for
a
pint
deep
copper
color
with
a
heavy
aroma
of
vienna
malts
not
much
head
at
all
the
taste
lives
up
to
its
aroma
with
strong
malts
that
dominate
this
brew
not
too
bad
and
very
easy
to
drink
and
on
the
wallet
very
good
better
than
the
dunkel
quite
a
sticky
pale
malt
flavour
with
a
herbal
hoppyness
towards
the
end
quite
bitter
and
salty
i
really
like
this
a
lot
strong
and
assertive
yet
subtle
in
its
flavour
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
with
the
grain
aspects
adding
to
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
i
had
this
one
a
bit
warmer
and
think
it
would
benefit
from
being
colder
which
may
mask
the
alcohol
better
dark
copper
color
with
an
orange
cast
and
light
ruby
highlights
topped
by
a
firm
1
head
that
receeds
but
holds
at
116
and
leaves
an
excellent
lace
as
well
the
aroma
is
solidly
malty
balanced
by
a
grassy
hoppiness
also
lightly
skunky
green
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
obviously
a
full
bodied
beer
the
flavor
starts
with
a
solid
maltiness
lightly
sweet
and
caramel
tinged
which
becomes
increasingly
bitter
as
it
crosses
the
palate
ending
with
dry
and
unfortunately
metallic
flavor
from
oxidation
finish
obviously
an
excellent
beer
but
a
damaged
bottle
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
remember
it
without
defect
its
a
solid
onetwo
punch
of
malt
and
hop
that
expresses
itself
in
slightly
different
ways
throughout
the
glass
probably
because
as
the
malt
sugars
build
in
your
mouth
they
retain
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
therefore
although
it
is
not
complex
per
se
it
is
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
that
keeps
your
attention
slight
metallic
spoilt
taste
could
be
due
to
green
bottles
or
travel
freshness
date
not
notched
on
label
decent
cold
but
i
liked
it
better
warm
as
the
malts
come
to
forefront
chewy
slides
across
the
tongue
delicious
bready
malts
are
the
crux
of
this
brew
some
slight
tangy
hoppiness
perfect
finish
small
sips
are
the
way
to
go
and
swish
it
around
for
a
while
in
your
mouth
wasnt
wild
about
this
beer
at
first
swallow
it
grows
on
ya
pours
a
nice
copperish
color
it
has
a
thin
white
head
good
lace
the
aroma
is
that
of
malt
mainly
toasted
light
bread
maybeit
has
a
nice
full
body
initial
taste
is
alcohol
and
a
sweet
malt
base
then
a
nice
notes
of
spicy
hops
a
little
fruitiness
as
well
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
warming
in
the
finish
overall
a
nice
german
bockand
also
a
cool
looking
green
bottle
on
tap
redbones
this
brew
has
an
amazing
lace
thin
but
simply
amazing
and
seems
to
stick
just
about
everywhere
bright
tawny
golden
hue
quite
aromatic
with
an
herbal
hop
presences
and
a
double
sweetness
of
alcohol
and
malt
very
clean
palate
with
a
bite
from
the
hops
as
well
as
the
alcohol
malt
holds
a
solid
medium
bodied
base
and
is
sturdy
enough
to
keep
things
in
balance
real
easy
to
drink
and
went
very
well
with
the
jerk
beef
sandwich
partly
cloudy
dark
copper
color
pours
a
rocky
head
which
disappears
quickly
soft
euro
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
exquisite
sweet
caramel
and
doughy
malts
with
a
lemonyhoney
background
on
a
solid
malt
backbone
slick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
until
well
you
know
that
warming
feeling

this
beer
really
suprised
me
clear
to
amberish
in
color
not
to
much
of
a
nosebut
when
you
get
it
in
your
mouth
you
know
they
use
alot
of
malts
and
very
little
hops
when
making
this
lager
so
i
grabbed
an
individual
bottle
again
last
summer
and
tapped
it
what
a
wonderful
malty
aroma
and
palate
to
this
spring
bock
its
got
a
springlike
flavor
too
like
the
soil
and
the
greens
hitting
your
nose
while
im
an
avowed
ale
guy
for
the
most
part
this
brought
back
the
memories
and
the
reminders
to
keep
tasting
em
all
notes
this
is
a
big
bock
try
it
cold
as
it
warms
it
tends
to
bring
out
characteristics
that
most
people
may
not
find
enjoyable
in
general
the
warmer
a
beer
gets
the
more
pronounced
the
natural
flavours
become
very
tasty
bock
nice
hop
notes
for
a
bock
undated
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
with
an
eggshell
white
head
moderate
carbonation
malty
slightly
bitter
almost
a
perfect
balance
between
malt
and
hops
neither
dominates
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
really
nice
clean
finish
i
wish
this
werent
a
seasonal
im
not
a
fan
of
the
darker
sweeter
bock
beers
but
this
one
is
wonderful
the
flavor
profile
is
near
world
class
it
is
intense
rather
complex
and
fairly
well
balanced
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
would
yield
a
world
class
flavor
rating
it
begins
with
herbal
hop
flavor
over
a
mild
biscuit
sweetness
as
the
middle
approaches
light
caramel
notes
emerge
the
middle
brings
a
mild
bitterness
over
a
slight
mineral
like
note
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
into
biscuit
and
bitterness
over
a
mineral
note
that
is
somewhat
dry
and
crisp
o
cultivator
is
a
good
brew
which
could
use
a
little
more
careful
fermentation
to
miss
that
midpalate
fruitiness
and
this
would
be
superb
as
it
is
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
drinking
very
good
no
bite
at
all
d
overall
a
very
tasty
helles
bock
blond
malty
enough
hops
to
provide
presence
and
bitterness
overall
outstanding
beer
and
forerunner
of
a
not
so
common
style
too
bad
this
isnt
a
year
round
offering
great
blend
of
maltcitrushops
flavors
a
must
try
spring
seasonal
here
taste
is
crisp
and
color
is
great
smells
like
a
frog
pond
mmm
tasty
not
surprised
but
always
amazed
by
troegs
for
me
they
are
one
of
those
breweries
that
never
seem
to
disappoint
terrific
spring
seasonal
good
job
guys
and
keep
the
new
stuff
coming
cheers
overall
an
excellent
maibock
the
fruit
spiciness
light
bitterness
make
the
beer
very
drinkable
feel
really
good
mouth
feel
i
wouldnt
describe
it
as
especially
smooth
or
creamy
but
it
was
more
thick
than
thin
and
definitely
pleasant
to
drink

good

brew
taste
is
bready
light

and
the

finally
comes
through
but
a
little
more
bitterness
would
have
been
nice
some
sips
i
got
a
little
hops
bite
in
the
back
of
my
throat
but
not
others
not
sure
what
to
really
think
comparing
to
other
bocks
i
have
had
its
easydrinking
but
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
and
alcohol
to
really
bring
out
the
flavor
overall
a
good
session
beer
but
not
really
a
ton
of
flavor
going
on
would
be
a
good
breakthrough
beer
to
offer
your
millerbudcoors
drinking
friends
pours
a
nice
deep
gold
effervescent
with
a
longlasting
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
with
biscuit
notes
and
backed
up
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
robust
with
all
the
aroma
factors
present
but
a
little
more
distinct
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
this
is
a
delicious
maibock
this
may
not
be
the
boldest
style
out
there
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
recommend
picking
up
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
an
excellent
beer
as
some
others
have
said
you
get
a
lot
of
pilsner
flavor
with
some
citrus
as
well
mostly
lemon
to
me
solid
beer
pretty
refreshing
for
something
that
has
little
hop
profile
o
expected
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
very
good
none
the
less
taste
of
fresh
baked
bread
with
yeasty
undertones
up
front
lively
carbonation
keeps
flavors
moving
it
has
a
bitter
lemon
citrus
hop
middle
rounding
out
with
a
biscuity
malt
mouth
feel
and
ends
dry
with
a
floral

not

verdict
a
very
nice
spring
lager
from

quite
refreshing
and
enjoyable
the
balance
is
nice
and
the
hop
character
even
after
a
few
months
since
release
is
impressively
balanced
without
being
too
bitter
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
golden

body
with
a
small
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
floral
hop
smell
to
it
with
a
little

also
the
taste
has
the
hops
coming
first
with
a
lightness
floral
flavor
then
a
little
maltyness
comes
to
the
party
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
really
nice
spring
beer
one
of
the
things
that
i
like
about
really
pale
and
really
dark
beers
is
how
well
the
pseudocascade
can
be
seen
thanks
to
the
contrast
the
liquid
roiled
and
rolled
around

slowly
began

you
dont
notice
at
all
reslly
enjoying
this
nice
spring
beer
overall
this
a
great
interpretation
of
an
german
style
beer
and
a
great
beer
in
general
bravo
simple
beer
that
is
good
for
its
style
and
hit
the
spot
clearish
gold
body
with
wellcarbd
fizzy
two
finger
head
that
dies
quick
with
minor
lace
patches
on
top
of
aroma
that
is
a
little
bit
of
soapy
dirty
hops
and
some
grainy
malts
with
that
breadcracker
edge
that
seems
to
be
a
familiar
descriptive
term
the
basic
taste
is
a
dry
crackerlike
graininess
but
the
balance
is
there
from
some
floral
hops
so
this
doesnt
turn
into
some
american
macro
crap
the
hops
give
off
minor
citric
and
the
malts
seem
to
have
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
them
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
and
you
cant
ask
for
much
more
o
another
winner
from
troegs
i
wish
this
one
would
go
into
the
anthology
pack
in
the
spring
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
troegs
its
ultimately
a
pretty
clean
beer
just
like
most
of
their
beers
maybe
im
not
blown
away
but
i
like
it
and
the
craftsmanship
is
pretty
impressive
good
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
great
head
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
germanbavarian
hops
havent
verified
if
these
were
actually
used
but
the
scent
reminded
me
of
this
light
malts
floral
notes
and
freshcut
grass
taste
has
slight
hop
bitterness
slightly
bready
with
a
semicreamy
mouthfeel
mostly
clean
finish
theres
a
slight
lingering
hop
presence
on
the
palate
this
is
really
a
fantastic
wellrounded
beer
and
a
great
stateside
example
of
the
maibockhelles
bock
style
perfect
for
spring
i
will
be
searching
this
out
again
very
very
impressed
with
this
beer
this
reminds
of
a
good
german
helles
bock
and
in
fact
might
be
the
best
domestic
version
i
can
ever
recall
sampling
absolutely
delicios
stuff
its
good
to
see
another
wellmade
maibock
hit
the
shelves
in
the
spring
something
to
fill
the
gap
left
behind
when
sierra
nevadas
glissade
went
away
clean
helles
with
a
nice
malty
and
european
hop
feel
drinks
very
easily
as
it
should
without
any
major
off
flavors
or
flaws
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
very
floral
and
pine
like
with
bready
undertones
in
the
taste
floral
and
bitter
with
a
sweet
honey
baked
bread
malt
flavor
well
balanced
and
easily
approachable
this
golden
bock
is
best
enjoyed
in
a
warmer
climate
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
solid
carbonation
overall
this
hits
the
spot
when
youre
looking
for
a
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
firm
hoppy
finish
o
ive
only
had
two
of
this
style
before
one
was
a
sample
and
the
other
was
dead
guy
out
of
their
retail
growlers
but
that
was
ages
ago
before
i
was
actually
into
beer
since
it
was
for
a
friend
who
shared
some
with
me
this
beer
has
really
surprised
me
and
is
very
good
o
i
havent
had
many
of
the
style
its
fairly
tame
but
it
grew
on
me
glad
only
got
a
single
though
not
sure
i
would
really
love
to
put
away
several
of
these
overall
excellent
helles
bock
delicious
full
flavored
bready
sweet
robust
without
a
hint
of
alcohol
despite
the
6
9
alc
vol
a
damn
near
perfect
beer
and
absolutely
perfect
for
these
last
bitter
cold
days
of
march
overall
a
nice
spring
seasonal
fits
the
changing
of
seasons
perfectly
overall
a
simple
easy
going
beer
i
would
probably
get
a
six
pack
of
but
so
far
have
only
found
cases
of
it
for
34
dollars
damn
pennsylvania
drinkability
i
definitely
like
this
beer
since
it
is
a
nicely
drinkable
helles
bock
it
is
a
good
solid
tasty
brew
that
ill
return
to
again
and
get
another
case
of
next
year
d
an
outstanding
lager
ive
had
several
of
these
and
am
really
impressed
by
this
offering
from
troegs
not
just
a
good
maibock
but
also
a
really
outstanding
brew
regardless
of
stye
it
is
proof
that
beers
dont
need
to
be
hop
bombs
nor
imperial
stouts
to
be
really
good
beer
i
could
easily
segue
from
a
case
of
nugget
nectar
into
a
case
of
cultivator
to
start
each
year
a
very
nice
and
welcome
addition
to
the
troegs
portfolio
of
offerings
overall
this
was
a
solid
offering
clean
appearance
golden
in
color
nose
gives
off
hints
of
floral
hops
and
touch
of
lemon
some
sweetness
taste
good
would
prefer
if
i
saved
this
for
sunny
spring
day
can
taste
the
floral
hops
as
well
as
some
bready
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
citrus
to
it
good
spring
feeling
sort
of
beer
with
clean
finish
and
a
spicy
touch
smooth
mouthfeel

where
would
get
again
bring
back
next
year
troegs
has
again
made
a
flawless
and
classic
beer
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
troegs
a
well
balanced
mai
bock
which
i
will
drink
again
great
maibock
recommended
o
a
well
made
beer
and
very
enjoyable
overall
ok
a
bit
of
a
sulfury
note
decent
hops
malts
are
pretty
nice
but
not
great
lager
notes
are
nice
drinkable
but
not
great
a
real
neat
and
fun
beer
love
the
bocks
from
troegs
and
this
one
delivers
o
very
very
good
beer
troegs
continues
to
set
a
standard
yep
deadon
about
this
overall
pretty
good
really
easy
to
drink
with
nice
flavors
balanced
each
flavor
works
well
and
this
has
a
tremendous
light
herbal
finish
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
maltiness
is
present
taste
is
malts
some
sweetness
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
i
dont
quite
understand
why
this
is
called
a
bock
or
a
maibock
it
tastes
absolutely
nothing
like
a
german
maibock
the
hoppiness
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
it
is
nonetheless
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
however
i
think
it
should
be
categorized
as
something
else
the
alcohol
was
part
of
that
as
well
while
not
a
session
beer
i
could
have
easily
downed
another
bottle
in
this
sitting
it
was
nicely
hidden
and
only
when
i
finished
this
could
i
feel
a
slight
buzz
in
a
good
way
like
the
nugget
nectar
this
beer
was
made
for
the
transition
from
winter
to
spring
and
would
fare
well
in
either
season
and
also
like
that
staple
will
only
get
better
as
it
ages
and
the
accompanying
weather
outside
warms
up
another
solid
offering
from
troegs
that
fits
in
with
their
existing
portfolio
beautifully
wholeheartedly
recommended
o
a
pretty
solid
maibock
all
things
considered
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
a
traditional
example
but
that
was
what
they
were
going
for
here
i
will
definitely
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
once
it
warms
up
some
more
o
troegs
has
crafted
a
great
helles
lager
here
its
on
the
bigger
side
but
it
remains
very
drinkable
and
balanced
a
great
offering
that
fits
well
as
a
spring
seasonal
id
probably
be
enjoying
it
more
if
there
wasnt
still
half
a
foot
of
snow
on
the
ground
in
march
fluffy
and
creamy
this
beer
is
delicately
smooth
in
its
light
body
as
well
as
being
crisp
firmly
so
without
having
to
bite
too
hard
at
6
9
abv
has
the
character
of
a
larger
beer
way
to
go
troegs
they
do
a
great
bock
the
essence
of
spring
experience
from
the
pour
this
beer
reminds
me
of
spring
light
golden
color
crisp
breadlike
lemon
smell
and
taste
with
a
clean
sweet
floaral
finish
i
feel
this
would
be
great
on
a
warm
spiring
day
or
any
day
fr
that
matter
the
nose
does
seem
to
scream
german
beer
to
me
but
the
overall
taste
is
a
bit
thicker
in
sweetness
than
i
would
like
o
more
substantial
than
your
average
bock
this
would
be
perfect
for
cool
spring
days
looking
forward
to
those
still
freezing
my
butt
off
another
fine
brew
from
troegs
that
is
very
different
than
what
they
normally
do
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
a
rather
sweet
but
still
just
enough
hopped
and
balanced
helles
bock
due
to
the
thicker
body
and
big
sweeter
and
bready
flavors
it
is
a
rather
slow
drinker
all
while
only
at
6
9
abv
overall
an
enjoyable
new
brew
with
a
nice
malt
forward
flavor
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
series
o
my
second
maibock
in
three
days
not
a
huge
hops
fan
but
these
were
light
enough
to
where
it
was
enjoyable
great
drinkability
o
i
really
like
the
balance
the
flavor
and
the
drinkability
this
one
definitely
follows
the
trend
of
hoppy
lagers
but
is
very
nicely
done
and
shows
its
bock
roots
a
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
maibock
would
like
to
get
more
of
this
overall
this
is
a
pretty
unique
and
enjoyable
helles
bock
it
is
dominated
by
the
floral
hops
and
earthy
malts
which
makes
the
name
and
theme
of
the
beer
quite
fitting
i
was
excited
when
i
first
saw
that
troegs
was
doing
another
bock
and
this
did
not
dissapoint
ill
definitely
have
it
again
prost
this
beer
is
clear
bright
orange
great
head
and
retention
not
much
scents
going
on
almost
macro
smelling
dare
i
say
it
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
has
a
hells
lager
flavor
profile
with
a
little
more
sweetness
and
a
little
more
hop
finish
than
most
german
contemporaries
this
is
a
fine
beer
by
troegs
this
also
is
the
best
helles
bock
ive
sampled
to
date
i
will
definitely
look
to
buy
more
of
this
one
supercrisp
superrefreshing
and
well
balanced
this
is
an
awesome
maibock
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
notes
in
2015
ive
also
had
the
sierra
nevada
hoppy
lager
which
is
much
more
hop
forward
and
dank
than
this
brew
golden
orange
body
beautifully
filtered
with
a
big
white
head
chunky
textured
billowing
above
the
rim
of
my
pint
glass
aroma
has
bread
yeast
biscuit
malt
herbal
earthy
grass
hop
notes
this
is
a
nice
smelling
helles
bock
so
far
cereal
grains
honey
biscuit
malts
grassy
herbal
hop
finish
this
is
a
perfect
beer
borders
on
the
sweetness
of
other
high
gravity
lagers
like
malt
liquors
maybe
a
touch
of
green
apple
but
no
residual
sticky
sweetness
at
all
this
is
great
beer
tried
and
true
this
reminds
me
of
a
version
i
had
years
ago
the
penn
maibock
on
a
kick
the
keg
night
at
fuel
and
fuddle
the
drafts
of
penn
maibock
were
marked
down
to
2
dollars
and
the
whole
bar
was
drinking
this
classic
style
with
big
smiles
and
laughter
abound
everybody
had
fun
even
if
we
were
over
indulging
that
night
sugary
glazed
biscuit
malts
bring
the
flavor
together
with
a
nutty
apple
character
in
the
malt
department
again
i
love
this
beer
carbonation
is
full
on
and
built
into
such
said
beer
overall
this
beer
brings
back
memories
of
a
better
time
in
the
beer
scene
when
penn
maibock
stoudts
maibock
and
victory
st
boisterous
tuned
into
the
beer
drinking
scene
also
sierra
nevada
recently
dcd
their
famous
helles
bock
that
was
once
a
seasonal
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
a
little
sweeter
with
a
lingering
mouthfeel
but
the
malt
and
hop
mix
is
very
good
glad
troegs
came
out
with
a
great
maibock
a
good
representation
on
the
style
not
a
phenomenal
beer
but
still
tasty
and
will
be
easy
to
drink
once
spring
officially
arrives
and
some
of
the
snow
we
have
been
having
waaay
too
much
of
this
year
is
gone
overall
beautiful
looking
beer
which
certainly
highlights
the
hops
used
with
a
great
balance
finish
i
liked
it
and
i
would
buy
it
again
o
i
dont
know
this
style
well
so
i
cant
say
if
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
or
not
i
sure
liked
it
though
the
taste
is
as
good
as
the
other
qualities
mentioned
above
yet
there
is
a
smooth
grain
flavor
with
light
sweet
maltiness
and
gentle
german
yeast
flavor
in
the
middle
with
floral
hop
and
mild
alcohol
in
the
finish
which
is
relatively
dry
overall
i
consider
this
a
pretty
high
quality
helles
bock
for
the
style
very
drinkable
yet
enough
strength
to
hold
true
with
the
original
very
drinkable
example
with
nice
balance
was
able
to
try
this
before
it

a
realy
good
beer
one
of
my
fave
lagers
i
can
put
theese
back
all
day
and
at
7
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
really
smooth
beer
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
weight
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
enough
to
just
create
a
mildly
fizzy
modestly
foamy
mouthfeel
as
this
travels
across
the
palate
finishes
dry
as
one
might
expect
from
the
bittering
hop
and
ethanol
content
of
the
beer
with
modest
residual
stickiness
across
the
palate
a
very
pleasant
and
satisfactory
mouthfeel
overall
the
color
was
a
nice
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
reddish
hue
there
was
very
little
white
foam
and
not
much
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
had
a
strong
aroma
of
saaz
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
of
hops
with
a
citrus
bitterness
but
also
a
citrus
sweetness
a
little
bitter
on
the
palate
and
aftertaste
but
not
overly
bitter
overall
a
nice
balance
for
this
maibock
another
sweetheart
deal
from
the
distributors
for
bevmo
from
the
500
ml
bottle
overall
an
interesting
beer
lots
of
honey
character
but
the
bitterness
cuts
through
to
give
this
brew
a
bittersweet
quality
not
unlike
a
lot
of
octerberfest
brews
this
pours
a
light
amber
tan
with
some
foaming
that
dies
down
into
a
tight
lace
theres
a
lightly
sweet
aroma
followed
by
some
light
malty
notes
i
get
a
mild
caramel
hint
of
sweetness
which
rounds
out
the
flavor
its
honeyed
and
mellow
and
exceptionally
smooth
with
a
nice
rounded
finish
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
starter
beer
but
i
could
easily
see
having
this
one
for
dessert
an
interesting
find
at
the
local
beer
market
very
european
in
style
now
just
got
to
compare
it
to
its
american
cousin
rogue
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
like
urquell
i
can
see
the
saaz
hops
becoming
too
fatiguing
to
my
palate
i
prefer
the
german
renditions
of
the
style
better
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
this
being
a
wellmade
beer
o
a
really
wonderful
beer
suprised
me
to
find
out
how
good
it
was
overall
very
interesting
brew
with
a
very
good
taste
theres
something
offputting
in
the
flavors
almost
like
a
forced
herbal
mint
didnt
come
together
very
well
the
taste
is
initially
of
malt
but
then
a
decent
array
of
hop
flavor
steps
up
for
an
overall
balanced
taste
there
are
some
interesting
flavors
in
the
mix
some
kind
of
fruity
some
kind
of
earthy
i
liked
it
and
will
definitely
finish
the
rest
of
the
set
i
received
however
i
probably
would
not
actively
seek
out
this
beer
i
also
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pint
if
offered
hot
generic
and
rather
unpleasant
its
perhaps
not
actually
offensive
but
its
unnecessary
in
its
weight
and
aggression
ive
had
far
far
better
i
liked
this
a
lot
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
maibock
wish
i
can
get
this
one
more
often
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
at
just
about
every
part
of
this
beer
for
some
reason
i
expected
a
big
hot
lager
and
that
is
not
what
i
got
everything
comes
together
nicely
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
little
too
heavy
to
be
a
quencher
ambercopper
color
similar
to
some
ciders
modest
carbonation
and
pours
with
a
medium
sized
firm
head
smells
of
grain
malt
and
some
sweet
notes
soft
mouthfeel
round
smooth
and
balanced
a
bit
hoppy
then
some
bitterness
but
i
still
found
it
really
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
golden
orange
with
some
cloudiness
to
it
and
a
full
inch
of
a
thick
white
head
good
retention
with
light
lace
the
aroma
has
sweet
grainy
malt
and
a
subtle
fruity
notes
the
taste
is
similar
and
rich
wellrounded
and
some
nice
character
it
has
strong
toasty
grain
and
somewhat
a
dry
finish
i
felt
a
touch
of
alcohol
right
on
the
finish
im
surprised
this
rates
so
poorly
on
ratebeer
and
rates
pretty
decent
on
beeradvocate
well
im
with
ba
on
this
one
i
liked
it
pours
a
semiclear
copper
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
good
head
scent
has
some
malts
standing
out
giving
it
that
obvious
bock
smell
the
taste
is
mild
with
an
almost
nutty
flavor
to
it
a
very
long
lasting
taste
that
is
smooth
and
hits
the
taste
buds
just
right
a
great
beer
to
go
with
a
sandwitch
pours
a
clear
light
amber
bubbles
swirl
inside
the
glass
while
a
thick
offwhite
head
head
clings
very
well

is
a
sharptipped
alcohol
sugary
malt
taste
is
an
explosion
of
sweet
darkfruit
malts
and
a
lot
of
pithy
bitters
an
overload
of
ingredients
in
fact
but
they
balance
out
nicely
has
a
rich
bready
body
while
the
end
is
hoppily
bitter
and
dry
an
alcohol
feel
is
present
too
except
for
a
scad
of
alcohol
burn
everything
is
good
here
all
in
all
a
fine
example
of
a
maibock
imo
and
something
well
worth
picking
up
for
2
00
overall
impressed
for
a
lager
medium
sweet
semi
honey
like
this
is
the
second
time
i
purchased
this
beer
2
for
a
500ml
thats
7
5
seems
like
a
fair
deal
to
me
if
your
at
the
same
price
point
you
should
try
it
d
although
not
terrible
the
strange
flavor
is
offputting
and
makes
this
one
difficult
to
finish
conclusion
this
a
great
light
beer
and
provides
a
very
good
drinking
experience
not
once
were
my
taste
buds
being
punished
with
intensity
or
bored

a
dark
golden
orange
with
some
cloudiness
to
it
and
a
full
inch
or
so
of
thick
white
head
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
the
one
you
did
have
drinkability
pretty
strong
maibock
overall
in
terms
of
malts
hops
and
alcohol
not
that
im
complaining
d
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
extra
special
has
a
decent
taste
pours
pale
golden
with
generous
white
head
noes
is
somewhat
light
with
a
clean
lightly
malty
aroma
palate
is
warm
with
the
alcohol
malt
as
the
focus
and
a
clean
finish
more
alcohol
warmth
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
its
light
enough
to
enjoy
with
everyday
food
but
perhaps
too
hot
for
being
a
sessionable
beer
i
only
had
one
bottle
i
should
have
bought
more
even
thou
the
high
alcohol
might
come
back
to
you
after
the
second
one
but
with
this
beer
i
dont
care
if
i
have
a
good
buzz
after
two
pints
d
i
just
couldnt
get
past
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
if
it
would
have
been
cut
down
a
little
by
some
hops
i
think
i
would
have
liked
it
better
its
nicely
carbonated
which
makes
it
very
refreshing
a
good
beer
for
the
price
but
ill
pass
the
next
time
d
overall
looks
can
be
deceiving
the
taste
is
similar
and
similarly
rich
wellrounded
and
characterful
it
has
strong
toasty
grain
some
bread
spiceyraisinygrapey
alcohol
herbs
some
grass
it
has
a
light
but
firm
malty
sweetness
underneath
a
fairly
strong
dominating
bitterness
that
is
herbal
and
grassy
and
with
raisiny
spice
dominates
the
finish
to
linger
nicely
over
underlying
sweetness
without
being
too
strong
the
beer
is
bright
gold
with
a
huge
white
head
the
nose
is
malty
and
a
little
alcohol
fueled
at
first
i
liked
the
solid
malty
midbody
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
and
the
bigness
of
the
beer
in
general
there
was
a
little
hotness
to
the
beer
at
first
but
it
smoothed
out
fast
drinkable
and
in
profile
almost
like
a
big
octoberfest
i
didi
not
enjoy
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
labeled
as
a
blonde
doppelbock
which
is
pretty
unique
from
my
experience
i
think
its
pretty
tasty
of
course
i
am
a
sucker
for
decoction
mashing
but
its
a
bit
too
alcoholic
to
become
a
regular
of
mine
not
to
mention
a
bit
rare
in
my
neckofthewoods
ahh
thankful
for
a
strong
beer
offering
from
a
czech
brewery
not
particularly
special
as
it
is
your
usual
czech
beer
but
a
bit
stronger
nonetheless
compared
to
other
offerings
however
it
is
both
affordable
and
drinkable
tasty
and
a
great
way
to
wind
down
the
day
after
classes
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
good
layer
of
foam
which
remains
throughout
drinking
a
bit
of
a
hop
flavour
although
not
much
to
write
home
about
i
drink
this
beer
regularly
and
can
highly
recommend
it
for
those
living
in
the
czech
republic
and
feeling
at
a
loss
for
strong
tasty
beers
it
should
be
fairly
obvious
by
now
that
i
dont
care
for
primator
blonde
bock
im
tempted
to
break
out
one
of
my
shot
glasses
for
the
remainder
of
the
bottle
but
there
are
only
a
few
ounces
to
go
so
i
might
as
well
tough
it
out
heres
hoping
the
bottle
of
primator
double
bock
currently
residing
in
my
cellar
is
not
only
a
horse
of
a
different
color
but
a
horse
of
a
better
flavor
pours
a
vibrant
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
tall
white
foamy
head
smells
rich
and
malty
grassy
with
some
sweet
caramel
notes
first
taste
reminded
me
a
lot
of
my
local
gem
capital
blonde
dopplebock
robust
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
grassy
notes
but
sadly
picks
up
some
astringent
medicinal
bitter
notes
that
give
the
tongue
a
little
twitch
and
detract
from
the
overall
drinkability
though
the
7
is
wellhidden
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
this
is
a
solid
dopplebock
but
i
guess
im
spoiled
with
capital
in
town
worth
a
try
as
its
still
not
a
bad
light

nice
golden
color

also
a

this
brew
really
does
not
feeltaste
like
a
7
would
recommend
this
to
everyone
to
try
at
least
once
d
pretty
easy
to
quaff
but
a

enough

to
keep
the
sipping
to
a

d
very
nice
beer
and
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
for
spring
even
though
it
has
a
big

taste
it
has
enough
hops
and
alcohol
to
balance
out
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
complexity
about
it
overall
i
like
this
as
a
choice
of
a
general
drinking
session
beer
just
real
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
without
being
overly
complex
overall
this
is
unremarkable
but
not
horrible
i
would
not
purchase
again
might
fit
better
as

this
is
the

it

a
sharp

not

hope
lingered
throughout
but
i
didnt
get
a
strong
hoppy
feel
as
other

seem
to
have
i
wouldnt
call
it
spicy
but
there
was
a
slight
burning
sensation
after
a
while
the
carbonation
was
suffiicient
felt
reasonably
well
in
the
mouth
and
was
quite
drinkable
for
a

its
a
beer
ill
have
again
along
with

mmm
went
well
with

a
melding
of
grassy
subdued

understated

and
mild

sweetness
similarly
flavored
with
just
the
most
mild

character
perhaps
mostly
just
the
alcohol
being
its
normal
sweet
self
finishes
with
a
very
mild
but
balancing
hop
presence
certainly
appropriate
for
the
style
but
not
exceptional
primátor
is
a
good
lager
that
keeps
the
fine

well
intact
overall

got
what

the
higher

seems
to
reduce
the
drinkabilty
of
the
beer
a
passable
but
incomplete
maibock
for
me
i
am
left
wanting
for
more
carbonation
and
a
quicker
finishing
experience
not
as
spring
feeling
as
the
style
usually
delivers
either
caramel
colored
beer
rather
still
after
a
minute
sits
lazily
in
a

wine
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
from
the
grain
but
a
little
stale
too
not
as
fresh
as
it
might
be
no
hops
to
speak
of
and
a

yeast
i
have
seen
before
the
flavor
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
for
me
coppery
caramel
toffee
flavor
from
the
grain
and
thats
it
no
german
interest
no
balancing
hops
not
even
a
drying
bready
yeast
profile
to
wrap
it
up
not
bad
at
all
devoid
of
off
flavors
or
weirdness
but
not
as
interesting
or
as
tradition
as
i
like
these
to
be
the
body
is
big
enough
for
sure
but
more
bubbles
would
really
help
this
out
one
bottle
is
enough
especially
given
the
only
sort
of
disguised
alcohol
strength
not
bad

i
wont

not

it

anymore
lakefront
brewery
big
easy
imperial
maibock
35
o
about
average
brew
its
not
a
super
easy
drinker
though
a
rather
rich
maibock
with
emphasis
on
the
malt
components
fairly
sugary
with
a
decent
hop
presence
to
counterbalance
things
the
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
fairly
subdued
overall
it
looks
and
smells
decent
enough
but
i
think
the
flavors
are
a
little
overthetop
and
slightly
out
of
whack
as
far
as
balance
goes
would
i
have
another
one
sure
but
i
would
be
open
to
checking
out
other
options
if
available
brief
review
and
probably
not
a
very
accurate
one
i
was
already
three
deep
on
an
empty
stomach
but
i
feel
my
ratings
probably
arent
very
far
off
not
necessarily
something
id
seek
out
again
but
definitely
something
id
try
again
overall
despite
how
my
description
sounds
it
is
not
a
terrible
beer
i
think
i
may
have
just
got
an
older
bottle
of
it
the
nose
is
great
i
am
used
to
a
darker
maibock
though
the
hops
clean
up
nice
in
the
finish
i
think
the
slight
medicine
taste
probably
comes
from
a
higher
alcohol
content
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
in
the
slightest
i
would
order
another
but
only
in
the
tasting
room
mild
light
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
lake
but
i
give
it
an
overall
average
i
would
reccomend
to
anyone
who
likes
a
lighter
beer
or
if
you
are
looking
to
cool
off
7
abv
its
a
good
way
to
get
the
old
lady
hammered
too
idk
hard
to
come
up
with
enough
characters
for
average
brews
o
a
good
quaffable
maibock
the
alcohol
profile
in
the
taste
is
a
bit
high
but
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
overall
taste
not
a
bad
way
to
go
for
7
99
for
a
6er
i
love
maibocks
and
lakefront
brewing
when
these
two
come
together
the
result
is
quite
good
o
one
of
the
better
maibocks
ive
had
its
clean
character
sets
it
apart
very
much
worth
a
pickup
pours
a
lightly
hazy
amber
with
a
good
sized
but
fragile
offwhite
head
slighty
sweet
despite
a
generousforstyle
hop
load
and
slightly
boozy
as
expected
for
style
medium
body
with
crisp
carbonation
well
done
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
dunno
this
beer
definitely
had
its
fan
in
milwaukee
but
usually
they
werent
the
types
into
good
beer
or
at
least
not
hoppy
beer
o
big
easy
imperial
maibock
lives
up
to
its
name
piling
more
malt
into
an
already
malty
beer
wonderful
nuances
of
clover
honey
and
floral
hops
parade
around
quietly
behind
the
deep
malty
base
its
sweetness
makes
it
harder
to
drink
more
than
one
of
but
this
springtime
beer
offers
a
nice
look
ahead
to
the
warmer
days
while
subtly
warming
you
up
on
the
cooler
ones
unique
beer
here
lots
of
different
things
going
on
despite
the
spices
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
holiday
beer
and
it
remains
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
warms
and
adds
rather
than
overpower
and
distract
solid
choice
here
id
be
glad
to
have
this
again
all
right
but
lacking
that
little
something
extra
for
me
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
thin
streaks
of
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
some
citrus
aromas
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
light
citrus
fruit
flavors
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
very
simple
in
its
aromas
and
flavors
this
one
was
disappointing
this
is
alright
rich
enough
that
it
would
be
rare
to
do
more
than
one
in
a
session
also
dont
drive
if
you
do
however
dont
turn
it
down
if
offered
had
trouble
finishing
the
entire
beer
smells
fine
and
drinks
okay
if
it
werent
for
the
flavor
will
probably
have
to
try
it
again
to
assure
that
age
or
some
other
factor
wasnt
effecting
my
enjoyment
a
keep
em
coming
type
beer
o
interesting
beer
definitely
malty
and
sweet
not
my
usual
style
of
beer
but
nice
for
a
change
up
im
not
saying
that
the
weird
flavor
is
all
bad
but
it
certainly
is
different
from
anything
else
ive
tried
youll
have
to
judge
for
yourself
whether
you
like
it
or
not
certainly
an
interesting
beer
if
nothing
else
overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
not
at
all
boozy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
extremely
interesting
beer
in
terms
of
taste
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
is
of
my
liking
either
not
much
there
in
complexity
or
taste
aside
from
malts
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
absolutely
have
loved
a
few
short
years
ago
still
a
nice
brew
but
with
the
explosion
of
truly
great
beers
gotta
grade
this
on
a
curve
liked
it
not
loved
it
o
paired
this
with
hot
buffalo
wings
and
some
dry
rub
jerk
wings
it
went
quite
well
another
solid
effort
from
lakefront
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
o
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
certainly
doesnt
separate
itself
from
the
rest
of
the
herd
im
not
quite
catching
the
imperial
aspect
other
than
a
high
abv
which
is
only
slightly
noticeable
otherwise
its
nicely
done
and
one
to
buy
for
a
mardis
gras
or
carnival
party
theres
too
much
alcohol
in
here
by
just
a
slight
margin
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
taste
but
it
gives
the
impression
that
this
beer
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
dopplebock
or
a
belgianstyle
beer
while
this
wont
blow
anyone
away
theres
enough
here
to
satisfy
most
beer
drinkers
since
this
is
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
enough
to
casually
enjoy
this
one
pours
a
orangeamber
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
doesnt
retain
well
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
bready
malts
with
some
grains
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
grainy
sweet
malts
with
some
citrus
and
a
huge
alcohol
kick
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
fullbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
overall
an
alright
beer
but
probably
more
enjoyable
a
bit
closer
to
the
bottling
date
o
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
probably
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
so
lesson
reinforced
maibocks
best
consumed
fresh
o
a
nice
beer
quite
different
from
others
of
this
style
will
buy
again
the
flavor
really
does
it
for
me
first
beer
ive
had
from
lakefront
looking
forward
to
trying
others
from
them
i
think
colts
got
a
very
old
bottle
for
his
review
drinkability
is
ok
i
will
drink
the
entire
sixer
and
i
hope
there
is
more
carbonation
in
the
other
bottles
if
not
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
again
i
would
move
on
to
capitals
maibock
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
not
harsh
or
astringent
but
overall
this
beer
is
too
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
regularly
this
was
a
refreshing
beer
that
went
down
easy
good
but
not
a
must
have
its
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
12
finger
of
foam
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
citrus
but
there
isnt
much
there
the
taste
i
really
enjoyed
an
almost
even
hopmalt
mix
with
some
orange
and
flowers
it
goes
down
fairly
smooth
leaving
a
sweet
aftertaste
even
at
7
1
abv
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
that
much
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
from
milwaukee
id
have
it
again
creamy
in
body
normally
dry
from
my
past
experiences
a
good
beer
but
not
what
id
expect
from
a
beer
designated
to
be
in
this
genre
of
beer
drinkability
ehhh
dont
care
for
it
too
thick
and
syrupy
and
with
too
much
unrestrained
malt
sweetness
your
mileage
may
vary
is
it
mardis
gras
time
already
alright
this
seemingly
appropriatelythemed
brew
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
maple
syrup
and
a
slight
tinge
of
orange
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grass
caramel
and
buttery
biscuits
these
do
not
go
well
together
let
me
tell
you
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
decent
maibock
but
not
really
something
im
gonna
look
for
again
a
brew
with
short
life
expectancy
if
you
can
get
a
fresh
bottle
or
on
tap
at
the
brewery
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
a
slow
drinker
even
though
it
is
at
7
i
dont
think
id
have
a
consecutive
one
a
pretty
straightforward
maibock
i
enjoyed
the
way
they
pulled
back
on
the
sweetness
a
welcome
change
from
the
average
maibock
crisp
a
little
fruity
some
caramel
malts
midpalate
a
delicate
lingering
honey
finish
i
could
easily
drink
a
6pack
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
the
body
is
crisp
and
popping
moderate
depth
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
maibock
candylike
sweetness
at
the
onset
with
some
tart
fruitiness
lowtomoderate
amount
of
bitterness
light
alcohol
on
the
back
end
theres
a
pleasant
bready
aftertaste
that
i
find
in
many
maibocks
i
like
that
allinall
not
a
bad
beer
not
the
greatest
representation
of
the
style
but
id
have
it
again
d
a
solid
maibock
that
even
with
a
touch
of
aging
on
it
is
a
good
drinker
sweet
but
fitting
for
the
style
great
for
the
spring
time
or
anytime
one
of
lakefronts
best
in
my
opinion
btw
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
lakefronts
eastside
dark
and
cream
city
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
nice
imperial
maibock
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
for
me
all
these
light
german
styles
tend
to
just
blend
together
nothing
all
that
memorable
not
bad
to
drink
but
much
better
alternatives
are
out
there
i
like
the
other
lbs
ive
tried
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
malts
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
hops
tastes
of
hops
with
a
degree
of
sweetness
to
it
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
decent
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
tart
malt
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
maibock
helles
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
lemon
sweet
malt
and
tart
malt
overall
too
acidic
for
my
taste
dark
gold
with
a
a
white
foam
head
and
very
small
but
very
active
bubbles
of
prickle
classic
beer
nose
grainy
flavor
that
has
straw
and
raw
wheatlike
flavors
that
cause
me
to
recall
bitburger
which
i
didnt
care
for
it
is
more
mild
than
the
aforementioned
german
brew
it
seems
to
be
very
mainstream
i
was
a
little
disappointed
as
it
was
kind
of
a
clunker
for
lakefront
in
my
opinion
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
through
the
six
pack
i
just
didnt
prefer
it
to
other
things
drinkability
well
to
be
honest
it
was
actually
better
than
expected
its
smooth
its
sweet
its
mardi
grasapproved
pours
orangy
golden
with
a
great
torrent
of
carbonation
but
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
crisp
with
a
light
noble
hop
floral
sweetness
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
orange
and
clover
a
slight
hint
of
honey
and
a
fairly
crisp
hop
bite
on
the
finish
and
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
clingy
and
surprisingly
robust
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
beer
with
some
flavor
and
some
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
big
easy
imperial
maibock
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
bit
of
haze
the
head
is
bubbly
but
fades
immediately
the
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
malt
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
crisp
sweet
light
malt
with
a
nice
mild
caramel
twinge
just
enough
spicy
and
herbal
hops
balance
and
mild
but
assertive
bitterness
im
not
sure
where
the
term
imperial
fits
into
this
beer
but
it
is
good
none
the
less
so
much
carbonation
this
is
absurd
pours
with
almost
no
head
nose
has
lots
of
malt
odor
in
it
taste
is
a
little
sweet
up
front
and
this
quickly
fades
to
a
much
heavier
malt
profile
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
carbonated
and
a
good
purchase
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
wish
i
could
like
this
more
the
brewery
makes
some
fine
beers
this
one
is
kinda
blah
personal
recommendation
hey
this
isnt
my
fav
but
give
her
a
try
i
think
youll
like
what
you
find
buttery
heavy
mouthfeel
big
on
the
pallet
great
session
beer
other
than
the
abv
probably
around
78
nice
all
around
the
year
type
beer
great
for
summer
refreshing
heavy
enough
for
the
winter
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
these
lakefront
guys
keep
a
look
out
well
done
so
were
left
with
this
if
you
can
find
it
find
it
then
drink
some
drinkability
i
dont
really
get
this
beer
why
not
just
call
it
an
ordinary
maibock
but
it
is
pretty
good
just
dont
expect
anything
exceptional
overall
definatly
a
thirst
quencher
this
just
might
be
lakefronts
best
beer
to
date
and
a
damn
tasty
maibock
to
boot
appearance
the
color
golden
to
a
tint
of
orange
there
is
no
head
the
nose
is
a
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
blew
me
a
way
too
me
it
seem
like
a
cross
between
a
coors
and
budweiser
the
finish
was
clean
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
this
lager
beer
from
wisconsin
was
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
upon
pouring
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
retention
as
a
skim
was
pretty
good
and
the
lacing
respectable
the
aroma
was
a
nice
soft
blend
of
lagerish
malt
and
some
generic
hops
the
flavors
were
also
wellbalanced
a
pleasant
sweetness
of
caramel
malt
first
hit
my
tongue
that
was
soon
met
by
some
piney
hops
that
led
to
a
bitter
crisp
finish
the
body
was
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
very
soft
totally
sessionable
wellbalanced
and
well
flavored
for
something
i
picked
up
on
a
whim
i
was
quite
impressed
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
small
head
on
a
light
amber
body
smelled
very
strongly
of
a
typical
lager
with
hop
sharpness
very
present
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
some
sweetness
mixed
in
but
that
hop
sharpness
pretty
well
covers
up
anything
else
there
was
a
couple
other
tastes
in
there
that
screwed
up
the
experience
a
bit
skunky
perhaps
certainly
off
putting
nothing
worth
jumping
for
not
a
bad
beer
not
brilliant
either
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
golden
clear
color
with
some
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lacing
there
isnt
any
the
smell
is
very
sweet
a
little
husky
a
little
tart
malt
some
citrusy
sweetness
as
well
this
is
a
fairly
light
bodied
beer
with
a
very
sweet
perhaps
cooked
corn
tastes
with
a
citrusy
backbone
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
and
gets
worse
as
it
settles
there
clearly
is
a
citrus
like
sweetness
here
green
apple
maybe
with
a
tad
bit
of
sourishness
in
the
late
finish
the
carbonation
is
modest
the
aftertaste
does
linger
more
than
i
would
like
its
okay
but
not
great
d
this
is
a
weird
one
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
from
something
called
big
easy
lager
beer
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
yeasty
fruit
character
for
a
lager
and
it
doesnt
have
enough
malt
character
for
a
maibock
nevertheless
i
rather
like
it
it
is
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
a
german
pilsner
and
a
saison
pretty
drinkable
really
would
drink
this
one
again
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
crisp
although
i
dont
love
the
long
aftertaste
that
feels
slightly
slick
a
fairly
average
offering
from
lakefront
drinkability
my
first
lakefront
beer
i
picked
it
cause
i
thought
the
bottle
looked
cool
the
beer
is
average
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
probably
sessionable
worth
trying
once
im
reminded
of
a
kolsch
when
tasting
this
the
skunkiness
is
much
less
noticeable
light
malt
flavor
slightly
sour
little
hop
creamy
body
drinkability
is
decent
with
the
style
in
mind
this
is
an
average
maibock
could
use
a
bit
more
lagering
to
smooth
out
the
profile
not
the
best
offering
from
lakefront
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
one
either
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
unless
you
are
a
tart
beer
fan
overall
a
mediocre
and
rather
boring
attempt
at
a
maibock
not
awful
nor
undrinkable
but
unfortunately
thats
about
the
best
compliment
i
can
give
it
pours
a
pale
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
european
malt
sweetness
in
the
taste
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
clean
but
not
as
refreshing
as
hoped
it
leaves
an
aftertaste
of
a
sweet
maltiness
and
a
small
bit
of
citrus
it
feels
big
in
alcohol
for
a
lager
as
well
as
darker
than
anticipated
but
a
nice
beer
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
not
to
my
taste
leans
more
towards
a
malt
liquor
than
a
lager
future
travel
plans
will
not
include
the
big
easy
this
helles
bock
has
a
deep
gold
color
with
low
co2
and
minimal
foam
stand
likely
due
to
high
alcohol
the
medium
malt
aroma
belies
a
huge
malt
character
with
notes
of
apple
and
pear
prior
to
the
malty
sweet
finish
while
the
applepear
detracts
this
beer
is
still

lager
isnt
really
a
style
but
in
the
craft
brewing
world
it
has
taken
on
a
meaning
when
used
as
a
style
descriptor
most
breweries
that
produce
a
lager
really
mean
it
to
be
the
lightest
of
their
offerings
so
i
think
thats
what
many
of
us
expected
this
however
is
big
and
bold
and
delicious
if
you
had
to
pick
a
style
for
it
it
would
probably
be
a
bock
in
any
event
this
is
a
well
crafted
substantial
beer
even
if
the
name
is
a
bit
misleading
has
next
to
no

a
vague
smell
but
i
wouldnt
even
hazard
a
guess
as

what
smell
that
is
ok
i
will
its
kinda
a

it

mediocre
at
best
though
this
particular
example
doesnt
fit
the

i
didnt
want
to
slam
it

hard
it
is
a
clean

though
it
seems
to
have
some
age
on

i
would
try
it
again

closer

type

slight

taste
is
very
malty
both
roasted

carmel
the
taste
is
very
close
to
a
dopple
with
so
much
rich

it
could
be
a
maibock
too
i
guess
very
slick
mouthfeel
only
slightly
carbonated
i
served
this
at
cellar
temp
and
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
dont
know
how
the
lobster
comes
into
play
and
frankly
i
prefer
not
to
by
the
way
my
6pack
came
with
a
lace
of
beads
does
that
mean
that
i
have
to
show
my
tits

clear
bright

suds

the

never
really
gathers

starts
and
ends
things
with
this
beer
by
mid
mouth
and
certainly
by
the
end
of
the
glass
theres
a
good
amount
of
buttery
diacetyl
going
on
maybe
too
much
for
my
tastes
in
that
the
hops
could
be
spicier
more
assertive
and
the
brew
could
be
a
little
more
dry
for
me
the
esters
from
the
aroma
seem
a
little
lost
as
well
lakefront
certainly
explores
the
world
of

for

its
a

cloying

a

into
my

head
is
quick
to
go
leaving
no
lace
either
small
rivulets
of
carbonation
to
bad
for
the
head
the
body
looks
nice
i
now
know
that
the
burnt
yellow
is
also
included
in
the
nose
of
this
one
soft
smell
burnt
and
almost
sweet
smell
is
weak
but
lets
see
if
taste
overcomes
comes
with
a
tart
tongue
squisher
that
has
hints
of
dark
oranges
but
light
and
the
aftertaste
keeps
the
same
appeal
mouthfeel
was
really
limited
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
have
earthier
tones
for
a
lager
an
amber
colored
brew
with
no
head
or
lacing
i
could
see
the
is
real
good
i
could
taste
brown
sugar
giving
it
a
sweet
but
not
to
sweet
taste
it
was
also
crisp
and
fruity
tasting
of
what
fruit
i
could
not
pinpoint
but
this
is
a
good
bock
bear
i
would
defintley
buy
this
again
clear
coppery
amber
brown
with
a
showcasing
of
unfiltered
floaty
things
suspended
within
even
as
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
rises
for
a
good
while

zipped
away

whole

that
has
a
toasty

and
buttery
notions
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
in
the
malts
very
solid
malt
display
with
some
grassy
openness
floating
around
and
a
delicate

feel
is
significantly
bold
and
malty
rich
creamy
yet
favorably
carbonated
and
full
of
good
zip
one
of
the
better
paleblonde
bocks
ive
had
subtle
rich
and
pretty
flavorful
and
drinkable
with
nearly
no
alcohol
traces
except
for
what
effects
it
has
on
the
noggin
after
a
couple
nice
tasty
great
for
a

hundreds
of
tiny
bubbles
stream
steadily
upwards
helping
to
maintain

is
limited
but
generous
notes
of
rich
toasty
and
lightly
husky
munich
malt
waft
towards
the
nose
the
body
is
firm
and
the
fine
carbonation
leaves
it
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
sensation
on
the
tongue
all
of
the
rich
maltiness
displayed
in
the
aroma
is
carried
over
in
the
flavor
its
rich
without
being
sweet
or
cloying
and
its
quite
clean
except
for
the
fact
that
the
straightforward
maltiness
has
a
bit
of
a
husky
haylike
character
still
i
enjoyed
it
and
didnt
see
it
as
a
negative
in
fact
it
lends
some
character
to
the
beer
and
reminds
the
drinker
that
beer
is
an
agricultural
product
and
in
this
case
from
the
epicenter
of
the
grain
belt
milwaukee
not
something
generically
created
and
pumped
into
shiny
metal
cans
in
a
sterile
industrial
setting
although
that
is
sometimes
true
as
well
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
never
makes
an
appearance
im
not
sure
how
strong
this
beer
is
but
its
definitely
within
the
bock
range
it
finishes
with
a
wash
of
sweetish
and
grainy
malt
across
the
mouth
but
its
so
deftly
balanced
that
it
simply
fades
away
without
the
bitterness
ever
making
an
appearance
very
nice
theres
some
real
finesse
going
on
here
however
i
cant
figure
out
the
name
maybe
theres
some
local
connection
that
i
dont
get
but
why
is
a
beer
from
milwaukee
named
big
easy
lager
beer
with
a
lobster
in
a
mardis
gras
mask
on
the
label
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
is
that
its
a
big
malty
beer
that
goes
down
easy
real
easy
quite
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
copperorange
appearance
very
little
head
a
thin
rimming
adequate
lacing
a
very
delicate
pils
like
malt
aroma
some
noble
hop
scents
please
the
nose
as
well
the
maltiness
in
this
blonde
dopple
is
not
overwhelming
but
rather
firm
the
flavor
is
very
pleasant
and
unassuming
floral
hop
tones
accent
the
luscious
soft
maltiness
very
nice
the
body
is
hovering
around
weak
you
know
i
think
i
pick
up
some
very
subtle
fruity
tones
not
necessarily
what
you
look
for
in
a
dopple
but
they
arent
out
of
place
in
this
one
especially
at
the
trace
levels
that
they
are
perceived
dark
golden
in
color
great
clarity
and
clean
looking
pours
a
frothy
creamy
head
that
is
gone
in
seconds
sweet
creamy
aroma
with
some
alcohol
present
incredible
taste
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
vanilla
butterscotch
heavy
malt
load
maybe
too
unbalanced
for
some
as
i
get
zero
hop
taste
very
sweet
but
to
me
its
not
oversweet
so
there
must
be
some
hopping
their
website
calls
this
a
blonde
doppelbock
tastes
like
it
but
not
as
hopped
up
as
some
of
the
other
blonde
doppels
ive
had
if
youre
getting
picking
maybe
a
tich
syruppy
but
im
reaching
for
something
here
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
and
im
finishing
off
my
last
of
three
and
may
not
see
it
again
for
a
long
time
needs
more
heft
more
malt
depth
and
more
smoothness
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
food
ive
had
it
with
homemade
andouille
sausage
chili
i
would
guess
that
this
would
also
be
good
with
any
other
cajun
dishes
such
as
jambalaya
gumbo
or
any
other
hot
spicy
foods
this
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
with
fresh
grains
and
maybe
a
little
honey
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
again
mostly
sweet
grains
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
pretty
well
carbonated
it
has
a
lighter
body
to
it
and
is
pretty
refreshing
overall
this
beer
was
decent
i
thought
nothing
overly
special
here
just
a
drinkable
brew
the
taste
is
not
too
bad
it
lacks
a
little
complexity
and
there
is
a
mild
buttery
aspect
that
i
dont
enjoy
it
seems
out
of
place
mild
hop
spice
and
slight
grainy
flavor
with
yeast
presence
in
the
taste
the
malt
is
pretty
onenote
and
the
sweetness
level
is
high
in
the
taste
which
is
almost
caramel
tinged
with
a
moderately
high
alcohol
flavor
as
it
finishes
i
think
this
is
pretty
hohum
it
fits
the
style
enough
to
be
average
but
is
pretty
much
a
let
down
in
general
i
would
not
go
for
this
again
but
i
have
had
worse
beers
and
it
hides
the
10
somewhat
i
think
the
problem
is
i
prefer
a
lager
that
comes
off
a
bit
cleaner
as
flavors
that
ferment
out
it
seems
like
this
didnt
finish
and
is
underattenuated
drinkablityoverall
overall
i
did
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
enjoyable
flavor
a
bit
sweet
for
sessioning
and
a
bit
heavy
aswell
its
actually
very
unique
and
not
what
i
expected
for
the
style
but
actually
pretty
good
and
nice
value
for
8
99
6
pack
d
i
love
this
beer
its
right
up
there
with
a
lot
of
big
juicier
belgians
for
me
pair
with
italian
wings
or
anything
that
isnt
delicate
d
id
have
another
an
allaround
good
maibock
nothing
amazing
or
surprising
but
definitely
good
o
very
good
brew
for
us
malt
men
very
balanced
im
very
glad
it
was
not
too
sweet
as
some
others
can
be
overall
what
was
best
about
this
brew
was
how
well
the
sweetness
was
balanced
and
contained
within
the
beer
it
could
have
easily
been
overpoweringly
sweet
but
they
find
a
nice
medium
with
the
other
flavors
making
this
a
great
and
interesting
beer
for
the
style
as
a
side
note
this
beer
has
been
one
of
our
favorites
for
a
long
time
and
we
originally
bought
the
beer
not
because
of
its
prestige
or
prowess
but
because
of
the
goofy
fat
goat
munching
on
his
ram
chips
on
the
label
this
beer
is
actually
the
culprit
that
got
us
hooked
on
maibocks
in
general
pours
a
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
malty
small
earth
and
a
small
presence
of
fruitiness
in
the
taste
small
hops
and
a
fruity
maltiness
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
clean
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
blend
of
fruit
and
small
hop
presence
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
d
very
good
brew
would
go
great
with
some
smoked
sausage
and
spicy
mustard
note
i
know
for
a
fact
that
this
particular
keg
was
stored
cold
for
several
months
at
the
bar
before
being
put
on
tap
which
may
account
for
my
enjoyment
of
this
particular
batch
md
thick
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
im
not
really
happy
with
this
one
so
i
will
not
be
getting
again
cheers
great
drinkability
abv
is
well
hidden
a
nice
chewy
helles
bock
glad
i
picked
this
up
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
think
the
way
the
beer
actually
tastes
is
pretty
good
and
makes
up
for
its
many
deficiencies
had
a
12
ounce
pour
of
this
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
in
new
york
city
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
color
was
a
browncopper
darker
than
i
expected
aroma
was
good
for
a
lager
and
the
flavor
was
very
good
with
a
definite
alcohol
character
without
being
too
strong
quite
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
can
be
a
bit
overpowering
after
a
few
overall
very
good
overall
a
very
nice
beer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
citrusy
hops
jump
out
joined
by
caramel
sweetness
a
raw
alcohol
presence
earth
roast
light
fruitiness
moderately
dry
finish
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
bitter
overall
with
just
enough
sweetness
behind
there
to
give
some
depth
still
feels
a
little
raw
not
as
smooth
you
know
what
for
a
bock
i
dig
this
beer
i
prefer
some
others
but
this
is
a
nice
solid
bock
for
the
spring
pours
a
lighter
amber
almost
no
head
and
slight
lacing
going
down
this
screams
malt
it
is
a
little
sweet
and
almost
no
hop
presence
it
is
not
overbearing
it
is
not
heavy
though
it
has
a
slightly
syrup
finish
i
dig
this
it
is
nice
drinkable
brew
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
and
its
undrinkable
down
the
drain
it
goes
i
spent
9

for
sixer
ouch
had
it
ontap
at
coles
malty

big
soapy

on

then
cheesy
beery
basic

underneath
it

some
sourish

like
a

macro
not
making
the
style
and
not
my
cuppa

this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
bready
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
very
sweet
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
and
some
breadiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
with
some
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
although
it
may
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
people
outstanding
label

pours
a
light
colored
amber
with
a
huge
off

that
fades
to
spotty

the

and
support
the

bready

flavors
the
8

abv
warms
slightly
but
is
not
distracting
the
flavors
of
this
brew
hide
the
alcohol
content
but
it
will
start
to
creep
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
cloying
moderately
carbonated
this
leads
into
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
bad
at
all
d
i
hate
to
be
a
this
tough
on
a
beer
especially
one
from
a
home
state
brewery
but
the
wonderful
color
was
the
only
truly
redeemable
quality
unfortunately
this
fell
way
short
in
all
other
categories
hv
appearance
is
a
pretty
copper
very
clear
sweet
smell
nothing
special
the
taste
is
what
i
expected
from
a
bock
darker
malts
sweet
a
bit
of
hops
flavor
to
balance
the
8
5
really
isnt
noticeable
head
was
minimal
carbonation
is
about
right
if
a
little
light
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
its
worth
noting
however
that
i
prefer
a
more
hoppy
brew
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
and
toasted
grains
up
front
cookie
dough
malt
and
tropical

tidal

overbearingly

thanks
to
some
rummyalcohol
notes
and
a
vegetal
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
gets
stronger
near
the
finish
still
the
finish
is
mostly
fruity
malty
and
warming
medium
body
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
not
bad
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
the
feel
is
thick
and
milky
smooth
with
a
honeylike
consistency
its
a
strong
drink
at
8
5
thick
and
dark
malts
a
nice
springy
hop
respite
a
fine
example
of
style
thanks
for
reading
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
and
malty
with
a
special
maibock
yeast
the
appearance
is
deep
gold
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
corn
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
and
one
of
the
best
maibocks
that
i
have
had
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy

that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
munich
malts
its
a
bit
sweet
with
a
dry
edge
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
warm
pale
and
munich
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good

its
a

were
too
overwhelming
and
unbalanced
of
the
five
beers
we
tasted
on
this
occasion
this
was
the
biggest
loser
of
them
by
far
too
malty
and
not
balanced
the
erie
maibock
struck
our
tasters
as
a
beer
without
a
clear
direction
not
a
style
i
normally
would
drink
a
lot
of
good
beer
from
erie
brewing
quickly
diminishing
head
some
light
stringy
lacing
smell
is
of
moderate
sweet
grain
and
fruit
taste
is
of
honey
and
sweet
malts
accompanied
by
some
fruit
and
alcohol
esters
and
a
hint
of
apricot
and
cassis
some
light
honeysuckle
on
the
warming
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
its
hard
to
resist
temptation
to
drink
it
faster
worth
noting
is
that
while
the
statistic
on
this
page
says
7
0
abv
taste
is
creamy
bread
dough
and
grain
caramelised
raisiny
sweetness
with
herbal
grassy
bitterness
to
balance
the
feel
is
creamy
yet
lively
it
has
a
nice
log
finish
with
lingering
aftertaste
of
all
the
elements
married
nicely
overall
not
a
bad
beer
if
the
flavor
were
a
bit
more
like
the
aroma
though
i
think
id
like
it
a
lot
better
overall
a
fairly
tidy
sufficient
bock
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
strong
marzen
and
a
typical
eurobock
alcohol
is
not
at
all
hidden
lingering
bready
aftertaste
with
less
hops
than
expected
given
the
ample
hop
load
earlier
on
but
then
again
not
really
a
full
flavored
bock
serving
type
bottle
i
like
this
beer
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
nearwhite
froth
grain
green
grass
hint
of
lemon
and
orange
to
the
nose
more
flavorful
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
with
apple
sugar
grain
and
cracker
followed
by
a
subtle
hop
finish
light
to
medium
and
interesting
for
a
moment
but
mostly
forgettable
which
might
be
a
testament
to
the
par
excellence
in
good
beer
these
days
than
to
the
mediocrity
of
the
beer
itself
this
is
very
nice
i
like
the
more
assertive
graininess
of
the
hops
and
i
love
the
aroma
easily
the
best
smelling
light
bock
ive
had
a
good
backing
of
malt
to
counter
it
too
hackerpschorr
did
a
nice
job
with
hubertus
bock
its
dry
with
great
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
the
finish
lingering
bitter
actually
and
the
drinkability
is
sky
high
i
would
purchase
this
again
and
if
you
like
maibocks
recommend
you
do
the
same
pours
a
clear
light
goldenorange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
earth
fruit
and
toffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
fruit
and
toffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
swingtop

very

is

important
to
me

leaving
just

some

and
some

little
bit

mild

note
its
a
clean
bock
with
a
bit
more

than
appley
sweetness
than
expected
the
taste
has
more
of
the
same
sweet
pilsner
malt
flavor
with
that
sweet
apple
note
it
finishes
drier
than
i
would
have
guessed
based
on
the
aroma
simple
sugar
mild
grass
hops
again
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
cleaner
sweet
and
simple
breadiness
relatively
low
carbonation
round
mouthfeel
almost
a
bit
much
given
the
lack
of
complexity
fun
to
see
a
oneoff
from
paulaner
in
the
us
but
its
still
just
a
decent
bock
i
cant
complain
id
love
to
see
more
german
specials
around
overall
a
solidly
executed
maibock
its
nothing
too
out
there
but
its
good
and
thats
all
its
trying
to
be
we
so
rarely
get
these
seasonal
and
special
german
releases
here
in
the
states
especially
in
colorado
so
its
real
nice
to
have
something
like
this
even
though
the
beer
isnt
supreme
itself
the
experience
of
drinking
it
always
is
from
a
brewery
like
this
the
color
is
crystal
clear
bright
golden
visible
and
aggressive
carbonation
amassing
a
sudsy
bone
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
nose
is
sweet
odd
for
a
long
and
cold
fermented
lager
but
the
grain
sweetness
remains
true
in
flavor
too
oddly
sweet
for
the
style
but
there
arent
enough
blonde
bocks
around
so
i
appreciate
this
uncommon
mix
of
pale
grain
and
lager
yeast
good
and
sturdy
too
lots
of
body
for
the
style
and
well
hidden
but
certainly
detectable
in
buzz
alcohol
content
not
as
decisively
german
as
the
other
stuff
these
guys
make
less
intense
grains
really
but
a
well
made
beer
doesnt
get
here
quite
as
fresh
as
i
wish
it
did
i
think
its
probably
insanely
good
over
where
its
made
but
here
there
is
a
slight
staleness
that
hangs
over
it
lowering
it
to
lower
quality
beer
status
i
can
see
through
that
though
and
like
this
one
a
lot
glad
i
got
to
have
it
and
hope
to
have
more
of
the
limited
german
beers
its
a
category
we
just
dont
get
enough
of
a
traditional
german
maibock
can
be
hard
to
findits
great

see
this

more
of

rather
tasty
quite
easy
drinking
malty
and
somewhat
sweeter
bock
a
good
one
to
try
overall
the
reality
is
is
that
this
beer
is
good
but
it
is
your

not

is
something

this
goes

i
just
wasnt
crazy
over
it
what
a
treat
to
have
on
tap
anxious
to
drink
this
again
mediumlight
in
body
the
beer
is
full
of
pilsner
malt
weight
but
yet
soft
and
sweet
in
texture
as
a
light
honey
will
do
the
slight
thinning
and
warmth
of
alcohol
relaxes
the
taste
and
allows
for
a
semisweet
finish
of
absolute
pilsner
malt
definitely
different
than
any
bock
ive
had
before
the
pilsner
malt
adds
a
crisp
dry
finish
overcoming
the
typical
malt
sweetness
found
in
the
style
yet
the
malt
retains
interesting
complexity
serving
type
on
tap
which
is
the
only
way
to
do
this
beer
justice
hard
to
find
but
worth
the
effort
has
appeared
at
romans
pub
in
milwaukee
a
bready

to
have
reviewed
years
earlier
what
i
would
have
failed

appreciate
then
and
what
many
people
fail
to

now
is
that
this
may
be
simple
lager
true
but
its
clean

fullflavoured

one

beers
out
there
its
not
a
total
loser
maibock
but
it
could
use
more
grace
and
balance
1014
overall
a
very
average
bock
much
too
sweet
just
about
worth
a
try
once
overall
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
up
there
with
the
whole
hog
pumpkin
ale
not
too
sweet
yet
has
a
decent
malt
presence
a
very
tasty
bock
indeed
very
nice
malt
forward
clean
better
a
few
degrees
warmer
very
light
head
not
much
head
retention
but
nice
malty
taste
this
was
my
first
maibock
and
it
wont
be
my
last
if
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
class
then
im
going
to
hit
it
up
again
m
smooth
almost
creamy
textured
medium
body
lightly
carbonated
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
seems
quite
filling
though
a
strange
maibock
thats
more
like
a
doppelbock
with
lighter
malts
than
a
maibock
of
helles
up
the
noble
hop
presence
go
easy
on
the
malt
and
control
the
ethanol
and
this
would
shape
up
to
be
an
interesting
maibock
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
this
style
and
i
recomend
that
you
give
it
a
try
overall
an
interesting
maibock
certainly
drinkable
and
decent
but
nothing
stellar
o
all
in
all
really
like
it
granted
im
a
fan
of
the
style
but
theres
something
about
this
one
that
i
really
enjoy
definitely
my
favorite
point
brew
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
o
one
of
the
better
point
brews
this
maibock
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
enjoy
on
a
warm
spring
day
wellrounded
nicely
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
cream
soda
grape
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
some
estery
banana
and
low
level
spice
syrupy
feel
a
little
bit
sticky
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
simple
and
a
little
bit
dull
not
something
id
revisit
overall
this
was
a
good
buy
saw
it
on
sale
5
99
a
sixer
and
i
am
a
sucker
for
maibocks
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
shot
glad
i
did
might
buy
more
yellow
good
head
clear
for
the
most
part
poured
into
a
glass
not
really
my
favorite
but
it
had
a
pretty
smooth
aftertaste
surprisingly
light
flavor
and
mouthful
wasnt
too
full
more
light
to
medium
bodied
wouldnt
really
buy
again
but
im
sure
theres
people
out
there
that
would
enjoy
this
beer
feels
a
bit
on
the
crisp
and
refreshing
side
with
a
smooth
creaminess
in
the
end
to
finish
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
this
is
very
good
though
not
a
mindblowing
beer
but
its
thus
far
the
best
ive
had
from
this
brewery
pours
a
nice
rich
golden
with
a
fluffy
white

decent

is

bread
and
butter
maltswith
hints
of
nut
and
caramel
floral

really
good
d
this
is
a
nice
maibock
however
like
most
point
brews
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
d
well
i
waited
until
the

of
the
12
pack
to
do
this
review
and
let
me
tell
you
i
was
sitting
on
these
for
a
while
the
stuff
is
possible
to
drink
just
not
all
that
pleasant
the
balance
is
poor
and
the
overall
execution
is
pretty
bad
this
seems
to
be
a
theme

a

can
see
this
being
a

beer
i
would
recommend
to
try
once
and
am
sure
i
will
come
across
this
again
some
time
in
the
future

really
making
this
brew
hard
to
love
or
even
like
a
regional
brew
from
wisconsin
this
beer
probably
goes
well
with
cheese
all
beer
goes
pretty
good
with
cheese
they
need
to
take
an
apprentice
ship
in
pa
to
learn
german
styles
a
bit
better
if
this
is
their
maibock
its
note
horrbile
but
they
could
use
some
pointers
dthis
brew
definitely
makes
me
yearn
for
the
spring
as
does
the
wilderness
scene
on
the
label
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
brew
dthis
is
a
pretty
decent
maibock
good
weightiness
to
this
good
substance
good
sweetness
with
just
enough
alcohol
to
keep
it
from
cloying
but
it
isnt
far
from
that
d
not
too
shabby
its
got
the
right
flavors
for
the
most
part
and
is
balanced
well
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
simple
and
straightforward
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
kinda
filling
though
this
is
the
best
point
beer
ive
had
in
35
years
and
im
a
point
fan
its
not
like
youre
in
munich
but
its
not
bad
compares
nicely
with
maibocks
from
wisconsin

like

pint
appeared

with
a

like
most

beers
this
is
good
and
clean
but
not
great
while
its
quite
drinkable
its
not
a
shining
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
with
the
sweet
fruity
apples
and
cherries
malts
are
backed
by
a
little
wholegrain
bread
taste
but
its
all
very
thin
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
meh
not
really
worth
trying
unless
you
normally
find
maibocks
too
thick
drinkability
being
a
fan
of
the
highly
malted
beers
this
ones
right
up
my
alley
a
good
beer
in
a
great
style
from
a
good
brewery
not
a
bad
beer
would
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
consume
in
irresponsible
quantities
but
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
acceptable
and
decent
its
not
the
first
bock
id
reach
for
but
its
not
one
id
swat
away
like
an
awry
tennis
ball
either
pours

1
inch

good

of
a

bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly

carbonation
has
a
kick
which
is
noticeable
when
compared
to
the
general
sweetness
tastes
of
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
up
front
yeast
characteristics
come
through
next
hop
in
the
background
slight
ginger
is
noticeable
along
with
some
bread
flavor
overall
a
decent
maibock
not
too
watery
but
not
real
heavy
on
body
an
easy
to
drink
beer
its
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweetness
for
my
taste
but
the
flavors
are
well
blended
i
have
fond
memories
of
drinking
point
up
north
in
my
younger
days
hope
the
einbock
is
just
not
one
of
their
better
offerings
da
little
heavy
all
in
all
point
has
a
winner
with
this
one
i
picked
up
a
12er
at
my
local
store
for
11
99
thats
a
steal
for
a
maibock
of
this
quality
yes
there
are
better
maibocks
out
there
but
at
this
price
or
any
price
for
that
matter
this
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
very
drinkable
brew
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
a
good
spring
bock
would
drink
easily
and
is
quite
affordable
compared
to
other
beers
of
its
ilk
btw
the
point
web
site
says
this
is
6
2
abv
toasty
sweet
malts
dominate
the
show
with
a
smattering
of
floral
hoppiness
and
a
bitter
drawn
out
finish
maybe
a
bit
too
toasty
showing
a
touch
of
oxidation
but
overall
this
is
just
an
ok
tasting
maibock
certainly
no
shortage
of
flavor
but
somehow
just
does
not
have
that
smooth
balanced
touch
that
makes
me
want
more
than
one
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
not
bad
very
mild
flavor
worth
a
try
a
quick
rush
of
bubbles
flows
into
a
onefinger
light
tan
head
which
hangs
around
for
a
few
seconds
before
it
fades
with
no
lacing
left
behind
color
is
brown
with
hues
of
orange
smells
of
wheat
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
tastes
a
bit
fruity
at
first
with
some
more
malts
and
some
hops
which
are
very
reluctant
to
show
themselves
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
this
ones
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
tasty
i
could
get
to
a
few
of
these
any
time
drinks
easy
enough
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
much
room
for
improvement
this
would
do
in
a
pinch
too
bad
the
head
retention
lacing
werent
up
to
snuff
the
taste
is
crisp
clean
with
a
good
sweet
bock
character
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
a
good
overall
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
this
brew
is
a
distinct
miabock
that
makes
me
long
for
the
days
when
point
released
thier
bock
year
round
it
is
light
highly
carbonated
straw
colored
and
high
is
alc
it
tatses
a
bit
like
sorgum
celery
and
malt
about
what
you
would
expect
it
is
a
good
attempt
at
a
maibock
just
not
maiscene
honey
blonde
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thin
collar
of
foam
decent
looking
lace
very
herbal
smelling
somthing
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
not
entirely
unpleasant
some
roasty
caramel
aromas
tastes
a
little
thin
for
a
maibock
but
good
nonetheless
malty
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
hops
to
balance
tastes
kind
of
like
an
import
medium
watery
mouthfeel
with
sharp
carbonation
worth
checking
out
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
to
sit
down
drink
and
watch
the
game
d
i
need
to
find
more
of
this
delicious
brew
stevens
point
has
blossomed
from
my
college
days
i
wouldnt
have
expected
something
so
good
from
them
wow
nicely
done
i
tried
this
some
time
ago
before
i
developed
any
liking
for
the
style
although
it
still
isnt
my
favorite
i
have
grown
to
enjoy
bocks
a
little
and
i
may
give
this
another
go
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
i
liked
their
retired
spring
bock
better
but
this
is
no
slouch
there
is
some
interesting
stuff
happening
in
this
beer
some
striking
flavors
that
could
have
made
this
a
real
winner
are
tainted
a
little
bit
by
traces
of
astringency
if
anything
its
an
invitation
for
me
to
try
a
few
more
maibocks
to
see
if
anyone
else
can
capture
the
variety
of
flavors
successfully
its
a
bit
heavy
making
it
less
than
easy
drinking
my
take
is
that
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
plan
on
a
session
with
it
overall
a
very
solid
maibock
especially
for
the
price
i
really
like
the
malthop
balance
which
is
key
for
a
helles
bock
though
it
would
ideally
be
a
bit
more
fullbodied
its
lighter
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
that
first
hot
day
in
may
stevens
point
einbock
onebock
is
a
pleasant
surprise
along
with
cascade
pale
ale
this
is
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
from
one
of
wisconsins
lesser
known
breweries
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
a
sixpack
might
be
in
order
a
good
beer
to
have
once
in
awhile
but
not
one
to
frequent
stevens
point
has
the
start
of
what
could
be
a
very
good
maibock
yet
they
need
to
make
it
much
bolder
and
improve
the
presentation
as
it
stands
its
decent
but
reminiscent
of
a
macro
wannabebockfairly
smooth
and
somewhat
tasty

a
bit
weak

goes
down
easy
not
spectacular
but
overall
not
a
bad
beverage
this
was
a
good
smooth
beer
with
a
taste
that
seemed
to
jump
out
ahead
of
the
other
aspects
this
was
5
99
at
binnys
a
steal
it
seems
point
gets
taken
down
a
peg
for
their
basic
lineup
this
one
is
probably
their
best
give
it
a
chance
and
compare
to
some
of
the
other
wisconsin
maibocks
it
probably
wont
be
your
favorite
but
it
certainly
wont
be
pushed
around

drinkability
isnt

there
really
isnt
anything
special
about
this
one
i
had
this
after
the
2008
stevens
point
bock
run3108
instead
of
gatorade
at
the
brewery
nice
amber
color
smelled
rather
metallic
there
was
not
much
taste
and
nothing
like
a
bock
typically
tastes
mostly
metallic
tasting
but
just
really
watered
down
and
then
a
strong
alcohol
after
taste
which
was
very
unpleasant
thank
goodness
they
had
their
rootbeer
also
on
tap
post
race
to
chase
away
this
bad
beer
overall
a
decent
maibock
for
my
first
experience
from
this
brewery
the
basic
maibock
chemistry
is
here
but
its
a
bit
too
dry
overattenuated
a
good
value
for
the
price
interesting
brew
i
will
have
to
say
that
it
is
a
nice
change
for
the
bock
that
the
point
brewery
brews
and
i
am
sure
i
will
have
more
this
spring
i
plan
on
sampling
many
of
these
some
this
spring
im
always
happy
when
the
point
brewery
comes
out
with
the
bock
for
spring
this
year
theyre
just
trying
a
new
type
of
bock
after
3
years
in
germany
this
is
the
best
beer
there

o
a
decent
bock
anyone
expecting
layer
upon
later
might
be
disappointed
but
this
is
what
a
helles
bock
should
taste
like
pretty
high
carbonation
but
its
quite
smooth
and
has
no
alch
presence
at
nearly
7
this
wasnt
to
my
tastes
but
refreshing
in
a
way
for
its
maltiness
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
strength
nicely
toned
down
and
very
drinkable
i
am
neither
a
big
fan
nor
an
expert
in
the
field
of
helles
bockbier
but
i
enjoy
the
clean
taste
of
this
and
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
it
tastes
like
a
munich
helles
with
elevated
malt
sweetness
and
abv
but
i
guess
this
is
just
what
the
style
is
about
i
will
keep
researching
this
style
o
well
it
looked
kind
of
crappy
but
then
it
turned
and
my
high
expectations
came
true
a
very
nice
maibock
this
is
the
first
maibock
ive
tried
and
it
came
as
a
complete
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
variation
on
a
normal
helles
but
this
really
is
an
altogether
different
beer
its
the
perfect
blonde
lager
for
anyone
who
loves
doppelbocks
a
slightly
above
average
maibock
but
its
lack
of
availability
is
nothing
to
be
concerned
about
some
locally
available
beers
are
comparable
or
more
satisfying
overall
mouthfeel
needs
some
work
but
the
beer
has
a
nice
flavour
the
highlight
is
probably
the
scent
good
for
the
style
but
not
something
id
be
on
the
look
out
for
in
the
future

aroma
of
solid
floral
malt
notes
with
light
sugar
notes
and
some
light

taste
is
also
a
mix

floral

with

are
more

less
pleasant
body
is
full
with
somewhat
of

interesting
and
easily
drinkable
though
not
sure
such

level
is
required
and
the
buttery

are
a

strong
for

a

a

past

you
that
any

not
stray

i
did

there
though
regardless
the
kloster
andechs
is
a
beer
connoisseurs
mecca
prosit
o
highly
refreshing
for
the
abv
and
an
easy
drinker
there
is
no
complexity
at
all
though
d
very
drinkable
and
a
recommended
brew
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
medium
longlasting
head
aroma
is
moderate
with
hints
of
grassy
hops
bread
and
lemon
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
citrus
bread
and
a
slight
grassy
hop
on
the
end
bitterness
is
minimal
but
noticable
finishing
is
very
sweet
this
is
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
quite
fit
into
any
style
category
i
think
the
closest
match
is
a
modern
munich
style
oktoberfestbier
although
it
is
a
little
too
strong
calls
itself
a
bock
but
its
too
light
to
be
even
a
maibock
and
is
as
strong
as
some
doppelbocks
regardless
a
top
quality
drinkable
if
unexciting
strong
lager
prost
pours
golden
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
tint
to
it
the
initial
head
was
quite
a
few
fingers
high
though
it
died
down
somewhat
quickly
without
really
leaving
any
lacing
a
bit
of
a
light
head
around
the
edges
nose
is
some
mild
grain
with
a
bit
of
light
fruit
and
cream
flavor
is
slight
grain
and
some
very
mild
brown
a
tiny
bit
of
toffee
light
feel
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
especially
considering
the
6
9
abv
this
beer
appears
clear
and
yellow
in
color
there
is
a
small
head
that
leaves
just
a
hint
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
distinctly
german
in
style
the
beer
tastes
fresh
and
clean
the
flavors
are
very
wellbalanced
there
is
an
underlying
sweetness
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
throughout
the
taste
though
it
is
well
done
and
certainly
not
of
the
cloying
nature
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
if
you
enjoy
german
lagers
klosterbrauerei
andechs
brews
some
of
the
best
around
beer
is
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
it
seems
to
get
thicker
as
i
drink
more
minimal
sweetness
and
a
nice
clean
finish
with
only
minimal
bitterness
on
the
backend
its
not
as
good
as
the
doppelbock
imo
but
its
a
great
lighter
pilsner
without
being
watery
or
thin
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
simple
i
get
notes
of
grain
and
grassy
hops
but
not
too
much
else
the
flavor
is
better
i
get
grain
apples
and
grapes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
double
on
sunday
although
the
alcohol
content
may
be
higher
than
some
you
wont
notice
it
because
youll
be
enjoying
the
taste
so
much
for
a
brewery
that
has
existed
since
the
middle
ages
they
have
definitely
kept
up
with
the
tastes
and
flavors
of
present
day
if
you
can
find
anything
from
andechs
buy
it
and
enjoy
it
with
zeal
notes
pretty
good
beer
a
little
sweet
and
grainy
but
it
isnt
bad
all
around
a
pretty
good
beer
yet
again
another
surprisingly
good
beer
in
a
style
that
is
normally
not
my
favorite
this
is
really
a
world
apart
from
dead
guy
in
hop
profile
and
sweetness
it
really
continues
to
amaze
me
what
two
brewers
can
produce
within
the
same
style
cheers
and
heres
to
an
early
spring
d
good
despite
the
6
9
abv
this
is
a
pale
strong
lager
which
is
generally
decent
unfortunately
it
lacks
the
xfactor
that
would
make
this
beer
great
the
mouthfeel
is
smashing
and
drinkability
is
very
high
since
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
not
much
head
on
pour
aroma
nice
and
clean
malty
perhaps
a
tad
of
alcohol
in
addition
to
heavy
malt
flavor
is
good
again
clean
and
malty
a
touch
spicy
maybe
cinnamon
just
a
faint
hint
from
hops
perhaps
some
noble
hop
types
are
described
as
having
a
cinnamon
note
overall
quite
nice
the
taste
is
very
good
making
up
for
the
poor
showing
with
head
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
to
drink
many
of
these
i
like
this
beer
and
have
had
it
after
having
their
doppelbock
i
would
definitely
go
for
the
doppelbock
over
this
but
this
is
nothing
to
scoff
at
this
is
quite
the
treat
light
not
boozy
tasting
but
still
a
fairly
heavy
boozy
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
the
doppelbock
to
me
as
i
prefer
the
darker
bock
flavors
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
bocks
ive
ever
had
this
actually
feels
a
bit
on
the
fuller
bodied
side
bergbock
hell
is
definitely
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
and
thoughtfully
then
the
glasses
were
empty
and
we
cried
again
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mediumtoheavy
body
overall
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
i
havent
had
many
bocks
yet
so
its
hard
for
me
to
compare
it
to
anything
its
definitely
a
good
beer
though
flavor
is
most
excellent
its
a
helles
bier
with
balls
basically
a
fuller
mouthfeel
thanks
to
the
higher
amount
of
malts
and
an
elevated
hop
bitterness
make
this
one
a
keeper
for
me
its
a
great
beer
to
have
when
you
want
something
stronger
and
more
satisfying
than
a
pils
but
not
something
too
heavy
such
as
doppelbock
or
stout
that
said
this
stuff
is
still
pretty
maltforward
and
doughy
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
has
fine
medium
carbonation
very
tasty
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
of
large
bubbles
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
their
doppelbock
for
the
smokey
character
other
than
the
smoke
the
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
with
an
odd
peppermintlike
note
in
the
background
of
the
slightly
fruity
malts
the
flavor
has
a
sweet
applesauce
ester
character
of
the
lightly
toasted
malts
the
aftertaste
has
a
pepery
hop
bite
but
nothing
too
big
or
bad
i
may
have
had
better
maibocks
but
this
one
is
certainly
different
and
interesting
either
this
beer
is
off
or
it
just
sucks
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
andescher
bottle
purchased
at
delirium
in
brussels
after
trying
the
doppelbock
i
had
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
the
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
nose
and
the
taste
were
a
bit
earthy
and
hoppy
and
also
had
caramel
notes
to
round
out
the
beer
nice
mouthfeel
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
quite
a
session
beer
because
of
its
abv
content
but
this
one
feels
very
drinkable
had
on
tap
at
the
klosterbrauerei
andechs
served
in
a
0
5l
glass
along
with
dinner
the
beer
was
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
and
creamy
head
the
smell
was
malty
and
sweet
and
the
flavor
followed
suit
there
was
a
thickness
to
the
mouthfeel
which
was
unexpected
leaving
the
sweet
wort
flavors
coated
on
the
tongue
easily
drinkable
you
cannot
tell
its
almost
7
excellent
beer
and
highly
recommended
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
good
bitter
and
some
liquorice
it
is
all
very
clean
and
relies
more
on
the
big
maltiness
and
bitter
the
light
caramalt
gives
an
aftertaste
of
vanilla
and
honey
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
d
drinkable
enough
but
not
sure
if
i
really
like
the
idea
of
helles
bock
id
rather
go
the
full
hog
and
drink
a
doppelbock
or
the
other
way
and
have
a
munich
helles
lager
will
need
to
drink
more
helles
bock
as
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
also
this
bottle
im
suspecting
may
be
stale
for
some
reason
will
need
to
get
another
to
compare
a
nice
enough
beer
in
its
own
right

d
very
easy
drinker
considering
the
strength
im
not
particularly
familiar
with
the

but
this
was

tasty
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
maibock
this
particualr
bottle
hasnt
left
my
fridge
since
returning
from
germany
last
year
but
tastes
just
like
it
did
when
i
sampled
a
bottle
there
review
combined
from
notes
taken
when
fresh
and
my
most
current
assesment
score
taken
from
notes
md
overall
the
body
is
mellow
and
soothing
while
the
soft
carbonation
makes
a
perfect
mouthfeel
for
one
to
fully
enjoy
this
highgravity
beer
easily
but
since
this
is
only
my
second
time
to
try
this
beer
style
the
first
being
rogue
dead
guy
ale
that
is
way
too
hoppy
by
german
standards
i
believe
its
beyond
my
ability
to
appreciate
its
greatness
and
some
finishing
hop

the
smell
was
malty
with
a

sweetness
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
light
sweetness
yet
with
a
good
hoppiness
there
was
a
hint
of
floral
hops
following
the
touch
of
munich
malt
up
front
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
overall
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
maltiness
and
light
hoppiness
lingered
pleasantly
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
nice
bock
and
rather
smooth
definitely
adding
to
the
drinkability
in
such
a

a
hazy

settles

down
smell

taste
is
much
the

with
malt
caramel
and
nut
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
from
my
tasting
notes
it
poured
a
golden
amber
with
a
large
white
head
the
initial
taste
of
the
bucking
bock
was
bracingly
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
nothing
but
heavy
malts
as
the
beer
warmed
the
bitterness
faded
but
was
still
present
i
am
not
sure
if
they
were
going
for
a
hoppier
maibock
but
in
terms
of
the
style
the
bitterness
could
be
tamed
in
the
end
the
bucking
bock
was
still
an
enjoyable
beer
although
overly
bitter
for
the
style
and
the
higher
than
usual
abv
made
me
forget
all
about
the
bitterness
o
not
bad
at
all
not
necessarily
an
award
winner
about
12
in
the
toasted
barley
sweetness
really
makes
this
beer
a
solid
serving
from
beginning
to
end
its
good
enough
that
ill
definitely
try
it
some
more
and
look
for
it
when
it
first
comes
out
next
season
one
of
rahrs
better
offerings
im
bucking
the
trend
on
this
one
its
one
of
the
best
maibocks
ive
had
though
its
not
my
favorite
german
style
very
drinkable
and
just
strong
enough
when
you
want
a
more
substantial
glassful
from
the
six
pack
bought
at
depot
liquor
in
brownwood
texas

alcohol
content
is

i
wish
it
were
a
little
sweeter
since
the
maibock
is
supposed
to
be
a
paler
version
of
the
traditional
bock
still
a
great
beer
though
deep
golden
color
not
much
head
retention
and
leaves
a
fizzy
surface
smells
like

taste
hops
dominate
and
an
overall

flavor
more
going
on
here
than
a
shiner
sweet
malty

mouth
is
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
overall
the
beer
has
good
taste
7
5
abv
and
is
8
bucks
a
six
pack
o
this
is
just
an
average
beer
really
nothing
i
would
crazy
about
and
not
worth
the
9
50
i
paid
o
a
decent
rendition
of
a
bock
may
not
be
the
freshest
at
this
point
but
still
was
decent
i
will
definitely
pick
some
up
next
spring
to
compare
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
bock
beers
i
still
love
hoffbraus
maibock
the
best
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
shouldnt
be
missed
bucking
bock
is
a
smooth
bock
that
is
not
too
strong
or
too
weak
which
makes
it
a
beer
than
can
be
enjoyed
on
a
daily
basis
for
just
casual
drinking
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
grain
sweetness
and
drying
hops
light
caramely
sweetness
is
nice
pretty
true
to
style
i
am
surprised
by
the
low
overall
grade
this
beer
has
i
think
it
is
a
tasty
helles
bock
maybe
a
little
lower
on
the
hops
than
many
of
the
american
renditions
but
i
prefer
that
in
a
bock
anyway
freshness
would
be
my
major
concern
but
i
seem
to
have
a
decently
fresh
sample
here
summary
a
decent
beer
overall
good
for
parties
with
guests
who
prefer
something
other
than
the
lighter
junk
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
i
would
drink
on
occasion
but
is
basically
a
clone
of
shiner
bock
so
ill
probably
stick
with
that
this
the
first
pale
bock
i
have
had
and
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
style
it
had
a
nice
honey
color
with
medium
lacing
and
fingers
definetly
reminded
me
of
a
helles
bock
head
was
light
with
low
retention
it
had
a
nice
aroma
of
grass
lemon
and
malts
first
taste
you
get
is
citrusy
followed
with
some
earthy
tones
from
the
hops
and
finishes
a
slighty
dry
had
a
good
feel
in
the
mouth
with
light
carbonation
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
was
a
tad
thin
but
nothing
to
be
disappointed
about
a
good
overall
beer
for
my
first
pale
bock
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
picked
this
up
from
central
market
in
fort
worth
while
we
were
staying
with
a
friend
the
beer
pours
an
orangegold
coloring
with
a
thick
light
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
layer
of

of

in
the
brew
citrusy
sweet
smells
with
some
light
spicing
flavors
are
dynamic
with
slight
citrus
caramel
sweet
and
light
coriander
spice
characteristics
the
beer
has
a
semisour
aftertaste
with
a
lingering
finish
a
little
rough
at
the
end
which
is
a
hit
to
an
otherwise
decent
beer
the
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
an
average
sized
white
head
with
tight
bubbles
smells
very
sweet
lots
of
malt
with
some
lemon
and
pepper
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
lots
of
bready
flavor
with
some
bitter
lemon
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
beer
is
kind
of
heavy
the
alcohol
is
detectable
and
it
has
a
nice
lingering
finish
this
is
a
well
done
bock
i
enjoyed
the
balance
how
it
started
sweet
and
finished
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
great
beer
but
not
undrinkable
by
any
means
bucking
bock
is
an
easy
drinker
not
particularly
complex
but
rather
tasty
it
doesnt
at
all
drink
like

amber
smells
of
clean
malt
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
diaycytal
taste
is
rich
and
malty
clean
middle
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
malt
oriented
beer
that
is
quite
pale
somewhat
rare
to
find
mouthfeel
is
rich
slightly
high
carbonation
good
drinkability
i
did
not
realize
it
was
7
5
percent
abv
until
i
went
to
review
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
nearly
undetectable
i
would
get
this
again
overall
this
was
pretty
bad
drinkability
is
this
a
bock
it
was
way
watered
down
and
the
flavors
that
were
present
did
compliment
very
well
drinkability
i
went
through
my
6
in
about
2
months
so
it
wasnt
something
that
i
wanted
to
get
through
or
got
too
excited
about
they
were
nice
while
i
had
them
but
i
might
move
onto
something
else
from
the
brewery
next
time
in
texas
though
it
has
been
in
the
fridge
most
of
the
time
sitting
on
this
one
far
too
long
apparently
worked
out
for
me
slightly
above
average
flavor
with
a
crisp
mineral
maltiness
that
gives
way
to
a
prickly
smack
of
alcohol
and
bitter
hops
finishes
with
sweeter
notes
of
creamed
corn
doing
battle
with
fresh
cut
grass
clippings
great
body
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
nearly
carbonated
to
the
point
of
excessiveness
but
pulls
back
just
in
time
to
achieve
a
smooth
finish
drinkability
works
well
too
and
the
7
5
abv
is
barely
noticable
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
bucking
bock
definitely
does
the
trick
on
an
oppressively
hot
austin
afternoon
pours
a
golden
color
with
fluffy
white
head
there
are
white
chunks
floating
in
the
beer
smells
like
sweet
honey
malt
and
a
little
alcohol
there
is
also
a
slight
barnyard
odor
a
sweet
malt
buttery
flavor
and
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
flavors
are
not
very
strong
there
is
a
wild
yeast
flavor
in
the
background
definitely
tastes
better
than
it
smells
the
beer
is
watery
and
thin
drinkability
is
ok
every
single
thing
about
this
beer
is
average
living
in
texas
this
beer
did
not
impress
me
as
i
have
had
about
a
zillion
texas
bocks
before
its
about
the
same
price
as
shiner
but
a
little
thicker
and
alot
more
drinkable
nothing
special
but
i
would
recommended
it
over
shiner
and
ziegen
for
others
who
like
bocks
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
and
a
good
outside
drinking
bock
beer
hope
they
can
fare
in
the
flooded
bock
market
of
texas
my
beer
prayers
are
with
them
really
want
to
like
rahr
better
than
i
do
but
always
seem
like
a
little
something
is
missing
the
alcohol
is
masked
fairly
well
in
this
brew
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
it
unfortunately
is
it
horrible
no
is
it
great
no
pretty
run
of
the
mill
for
a
bock
this
brew
pours
up
a
rusty
orange
color
woth
a
nice
big
frizzy
white
head
the
nose
is
composed
of
orange
peel
lemon
peel
pale
german
malts
a
lttle
yeast
subtle
raspberries
wow
better
than
i
expected
it
to
taste
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
characters
as
the
nose
except
more
intense
on
the
orange
peel
the
7
5
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
crisp
beer
medium
bodied
heavy
carbo
up
front
then
low
carbo
as
the
beer
warms
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
would
actually
buy
from
this
brewery
thanks
to
the
label
i
keep
wanting
to
call
this
brew
bucking
bronc
it
might
be
worth
a
look
if
youre
crazy
about
the
style
but
this
ba
has
no
desire
to
get
back
in
the
saddle
after
this
bottle
has
been
drained
thanks
beerzack
drinkability
doesnt
taste
like
a
bock
more
like
a
weak
berliner
weiss
without
the
wheat
drinkability
easy
drinker
but
watch
out
for
the
high
abv
nice
but
ive
had
better
maibacks
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
rich
in
flavor
superb
brew
i
love
it
thanks
again
to
larry
for
bringing
this
to
oregon
this
one
was
very
all
over
the
map
in
flavor
and
aroma
and
was
a
unique
experience
as
a
congratulations
to
another
texas
brewery
placing
in
the
world
beer
cup
third
place
german
style
helles
maibock
i
figured
i
should
get
around
to
reviewing
this
one
pours
a
golden
honey
hue
with
a
light
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
film
across
the
beer
smells
great
hints
of
apple
honey
and
rounded
earthy
buscuit
malt
goodness
taste
is
spot
on
for
a
maibock
nothing
overly
offensive
even
the
earthy
malt
balances
out
with
hints
of
red
grape
juice
and
sweet
honey
such
a
nice
change
from
the
dopplebocks
of
winter
seasonal
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
finishes
crisp
and
dry
i
wish
the
abv
was
a
percent
or
two
lower
so
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
on
a
sunday
afternoon
but
a
very
solid
offering
from
one
of
texas
newest
breweries
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dusty
gold
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
smell
is
caramel
and
corn
like
malt
pleasant
taste
is
very
sweet
and
corn
like
in
flavor
with
not
much
else
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
refreshing
carbonation
but
a
bit
watery
in
the
finish
not
what
i
expected
of
the
style
but
very
drinkable
surprised
that
it
was
7
5
and
its
not
noticeable
1st
drinkable
beer
from
this
brewery
ive
had
so
far
had
this
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
it
came
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
3
finger
head
the
color
was
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
smell
was
malty
and
the
taste
followed
suit
with
just
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
very
clean
and
had
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
in
it
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
hope
to
be
able
to
buy
a
6er
of
this
for
enjoyment
at
home
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
the
carbonation
is
active
and
pairs
well
with
the
beers
overall
character
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
if
i
could
get
it
in
cincinnati
this
would
be
a
staple
beer
drink
easy
for
the
abv
not
a
great
maibock
but
a
pretty
good
quaffer
all
things
considered
drinkability
light
in
flavor
but
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
drinkability
very
drinklable
for
such
high
abv
almost
dangerous
i
think
this
is
so
drinkable
because
it
is
kinda
bland
at
8
99
or
was
it
9
99
a
six
pack
i
will
probably
not
purchase
again
its
not
that
great
md
easily
drinkable
my
girlfriend
loved
it
actually
stole
my
glass
easy
down
and
very
smooth
just
not
complex
a
nice
session
bock
well
its
wayyy
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
abv
beer
and
you
could
hurt
yourself
if
youre
not
careful
i
might
recommend
this
as
a
gateway
brew
there
are
certainly
no
off
flavors
but
this
is
probably
rahrs
weakest
effort
no
reason
to
want
another
of
these
plus
the
8
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
i
guess
that
could
be
one
reason
to
have
another
but
ill
pass
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
yearly
mouthfeel
is
moderately
creamy
this
is
a
clear
brassy
bear
with
little
head
it
smells
of
sweet
grain
and
light
fruit
it
has
a
musty
grain
imperial
pilsner
kind
of
taste
that
puts
it
on
the
brighter
and
cleaner
side
of
the
malt
liquor
spectrum
there
is
a
slight
fruitiness
and
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitter
before
it
is
pushed
out
again
by
grain
sweetness
there
is
a
slight
twang
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
weight
and
the
beer
is
pretty
flat
it
is
an
alright
beer
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
with
alot
of
booze
that
you
cant
taste
this
is
it
for
sure
im
just
not
into
this
as
maibock
a
pretty
good
beer
but
a
lousy
value
everywhere
i
have
seen
this
beer
has
it
very
expensive
and
i
just
dont
think
it
is
good
enough
to
merit
the
price
2
19
for
a
single
bottle
or
9
99
for
a
six
pack
at
the
beer
shop
i
was
at
in
austin
other
locations
ive
visted
had
similiar
prices
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
soon
vanishes
completely
nose
is
sweet
grain
up
front
with
some
fainter
notes
of
herbal
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
lightly
toasted
malty
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
a
touch
of
tart
fruit
and
finally
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
crisp
and
easydrinking
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
has
no
special
qualities
slightly
above
middle
of
the
pack
at
best
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
14
beige
head
over
the
light
amber
brew
head
is
to
a
film
in
scant
moments
with
some
bubbles
here
and
there
constituting
the
lacing
aroma
is
some
grain
with
a
lightly
tart
fruitiness
taste
exhibits
a
fuller
depth
of
malt
flavor
and
the
fruitiness
i
was
worried
about
has
moved
on
before
getting
into
my
mouth
no
evidence
of
8abv
in
the
flavor
or
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
would
benefit
from
a
tad
more
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
reasonably
good
as
well
this
brew
left
me
a
bit
wanting
for
what
could
have
been
d
very
smooth
if
i
wouldnt
get
hammered
from
drinking
more
than
two
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
very
big
beer
without
being
to
heavy
goes
down
too
easy
watch
yourself
i
started
to
lose
fealing
in
my
legs
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
definitely
think
that
it
is
the
best
so
far
to
come
out
of
the
rahr
brewery
i
am
always
shy
of
anything
that
has
the
words
bock
and
texas
on
the
same
label
as
this
is
normally
a
bastardization
of
an
american
dark
lager
at
best
this
beer
actually
fits
the
bill
of
a
maibock
i
personally
think
that
the
mash
was
a
little
short
on
this
brew
as
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
that
can
be
mashed
out
but
still
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
to
style
i
would
try
this
one
again
color
is
honey
golden
head
is
very
small
and
has
no
retention
aroma
is
weak
and
consists
of
a
sweet
grainy
smell
taste
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
lightly
toasted
malt
an
edge
of
grain
is
noted
a
mild
herbal
hop
flavor
is
in
the
mix
as
well
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
overall
flavor
here
is
pretty
good
but
a
stronger
malt
body
would
improve
this
beer
dan
d
good
drinkability
beer
is
fairly
big
in
mouthfeel
and
abv
two
would
be
sufficient
to
knock
off
the
chill
this
is
the
7
5
version
pours
a
dark
honey
with
a
foamy
thin
head
head
dispates
quickly
smells
extremely
sweet
grainy
and
malty
not
terribly
impressed
pleasant
malt
and
grain
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
honey
and
i
think
white
grapes
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dense
from
the
alcohol
and
not
overly
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
its
a
subdued
golden
color
out
of
the
bottle
little
head
light
malty
aroma
but
not
much
else
is
discernible
however
the
taste
is
quite
pleasant
deeply
malty
with
a
light
and
crisp
finish
the
high
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
is
very
deceptive
not
a
session
beer
although
you
could
easily
want
to
make
it
one
i
believe
that
rahr
may
have
finally
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
its
a
seasonal
keeper
nicely
done
thanks
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
first
run
of
the
label
i
hope
future
versions
step
up
umm
seroiusly
i
need
a
case
of
this
beer
for
further
review
wow
this
is
one
tight
lady
a
strong
bock
that
i
didnt
even
know
was
8
until
it
was
buzzing
around
my
head
amberbrown
with
a
dense
white
cap
that
laces
the
whole
glass
smell
is
a
little
muted
but
there
is
a
nice
toasty
malt
and
sweetness
there
the
flavor
is
a
kick
that
is
full
of
potent
toasty
bready
malt
flavors
and
it
has
a
little
underlying
hop
bite
that
brings
it
back
nice
melding
and
the
aftertaste
last
a
good
spell
without
any
really
noticable
boozy
qualities
nice
medfull
body
but
very
drinkable
this
brew
has
an
extremely
clean
finish
to
it
mid
to
low
carbonation
and
mild
hopping
only
further
increase
the
drinkability
factor
of
this
slippery
light
bodied
brew
this
drinkabiliy
comes
at
the
expense
of
mouthfeel
somewhat
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
nonintrusive
supple
hops
are
barely
perceivable
as
the
malt
carries
most
of
the
focus
in
summary
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
this
could
be
a
staple
in
my
session
lineup
not
a
stellar
beer
from
rahr
but
quite
drinkable
regardless
pours
a
clear
gold
color
head
starts
out
at
about
two
fingers
but
has
low
retention
and
no
lacing
smell
is
pretty
clean
sweet
malt
with
little
to
no
hop
taste
is
fairly
simple
nice
malt
that
lasts
forever
in
the
aftertaste
very
slight
hop
shows
up
near
the
end
like
paul
i
find
it
very
hard
to
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
beer
extremely
drinkable
edit
after
the
first
batch
fritz
tinkered
with
the
recipe
just
a
little
slightly
darker
more
of
a
copper
color
a
touch
maltier
maybe
a
faint
metallic
element
goodbad
balances
out
so
im
leaving
the
numbers
the
same
