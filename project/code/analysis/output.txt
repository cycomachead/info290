3 This rusty brew is intense and imposing, with organoleptics of toffee, butter, caramel and yeast layered around a minty pine-y center. Some citric hints sneak through on the tongue, to unfortunate effects as it clashes with the darker flavors. Furthermore the palate is flabby and coarse  with a premature finish. Extremely unfocused with some questionable choices made regarding the hops.

4 Quite good but not as spectacular as other beers from this brewery (Disco Soleil, Rose d'Hisbiscus, MoralitÃ©). Still, this is a decent altbier.

2 Overall: Excellent; malty and clean bittering.  Could drink this all day.  The best of a brown ale and a German lager together.  Would buy a sixer if readily available.  [My first Altbier.]

1 As I stated earlier, a unique hybrid. Nice to see a holiday-themed brew doing something besides adding spices. This beer may not truly understand what it actually is, beyond fairly delicious.

6 The body itself, almost full but sticking to a solid medium range, is pretty rich. It's dry all the way from middle to finish after starting off semi-dry, and all the more as a feel like burnt woods and an ashy feel mingle on the palate.

1 Its been a long time I wanted to try this one. Finally got my hands on one. Clear beer. Effervescent too. Amber color. Nice creamy head thrones on top of it. Malty and some burnt caramel in the nose. Tastewise, the beer is more roasted malts than anything else. Very refreshing. Effervescent too but still sweet in the mouth. Light body to medium. Refreshing and delicious. A good summer beer with lots of taste! Cheers!

5 Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 7C). AROMA: predominant malt aroma. almost absent hop aroma and absent esters. APPEARANCE: Orange copper color, clear, ivory persistent and creamy head. TASTE: well balanced flavour between moderate bitterness and complex malt. dry finish. very low esters, no diacetyl. Finishes dry. very low hop flavours. PALATE: medium to light body and very smooth. no astringency. OVERALL: a very well balanced, bitter and malty ale. requires a bit more hop aromas and flavours.

Not quite the same... I'm reviewing this as a Sticke. My rating would be quite higher if this was a regular Altbier.

Inconvenient bitter, very complex, with a distinct flowery, dry hop note amongst a bready malt body.

1 Tried this beer twice. The first one might've been an old batch because it was kinda sour but the last one I had taste great. It was malty with a nice semi sweet finish. I'll definitely be drinking more of these in the future.

6 The color is dark amber with translucent clarity and thick beige head with fine bead and some lace with good retention. The smell has a slight fruity yeast aroma with subtle sweet malt scent and gentle hop note with hint of fruity yeast ester as it warms with light alcohol. The feel has medium high carbonation with  slight spice and light sweetness and gentle toasted aspect with mostly dry bitter finish with mild alcohol influence on the palate. The feel leads to a mix of malt with toasted flavor and spicy/herbal hop with gentle malt backing and slightly bitter hops with a malt emphasis on toasted grain flavor and finish is spicy bitter and mostly dry. This is a decent alt but more emphasis on hops than is necessary for the style could use more malt to fit even though it is still very drinkable and yeast seems to be a proper alt strain based on aroma and flavor

3 Ishmael is a decent attempt at an American twist on a German-style altbier. However, the earthy hops were rather overdone for my liking. Perhaps I need to try a fresher bottle to see if the hops contribute more than just bitterness.

3 Not too sure how true to form this is for an altbier but I do know scurry is exceptionally drinkable.  The honey and molasses are very present but never overpowering.  The surprisingly crisp and light mouthfeel combine with just enough hop character to balance the sweetness.  Perfect sessionable beer for those cool summer nights.

Taste light nutty malt, mild tartness, earthy, floral, citrusy hops. Ok Alt!
4 MÃ¼nster Alt pours clean cloudy gold with a 2â off white foam cap that fairly quickly drops to a tinny hillock that leaves lines of lace with each drink. Floral aromas join light fruit and grain on the nose. The palate starts with a hint of sweetness and finishes dry with a little fruity tartness. Light grains form the backbone. Medium body and medium low carbonation. Very easy to drink and very refreshing.

Very happy with this beer at the low price!

3 Hazy amber/brownish color with a tan head that gives way to decent lacing.  Both the smell and tastes are a good combination of malt and floral hops.  Very refreshing.  The finish is neither dry nor sweet.  The mouthfeel is good as is the carbonation level.  Overall this is a great beer to have with hot wings (which I did) and with the lower ABV it is an excellent session beer.

5           (Our little red rooster).   Strong copper color. Like a shiny Lincoln penny.  Sweet floral smell.  Very smooth taste for an amber.

Maybe this bottle is a bit past its prime (expires in two months), but I don't see this being much better fresh.
6 This beer poured out as a reddish brown color with a tan colored head that was pretty thin. The aromas were of a lot of grains and malt. There isn't a whole lot of hops on the nose or much else. Perhaps a little spice but that's about it. The taste is mostly dry malt, some fresh leaves some other flavors of nature in there. The mouthfeel is medium, It's drinkable and worth trying again. I was better than I expected.

1 Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled in 11/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, light pear/apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, light pear/apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light amount herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, floral, grass, light pine, light pear/apple, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very good altbier style. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is hoppy for an altbier, but the flavors were very much what I expected for the style. A nicely enjoyable offering.

More proof that local is the way to go.

I like that it isn't one of their more hop forward, less malty, beers. It does have a great caramel malty taste, and it is very clean and easy drinking. Bring this beer to your next fall gathering and pair it with some sausages!

Great brew.

5 This 'Altbier' (German for 'old style') style brew pours a pretty copper-amber in color with close to a finger of a off-white foamy head. Some 'ring-like' lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of mostly nutty roasted malts. Pretty much is said for the taste as well with good very light bitter finish that doesn't last too long. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall a tasty brew.

5 First thoughts, wow this thing is dark for an Alt which in my opinion is a style of beer that often goes overlooked here in the states. The only thing I am sitting here wondering about is if Victor's Memoriale is really an Altbier, why did I get so much yeast flocculated in the dregs of the bottle? Enough nitpicking though, this beer is delicious and deceptively strong...really creeps up on you with that last sip.

2 Pours a copper red color with a thin creamy head.  Smell is not overly active, but can smell the malts.  Extremely smooth finish in which Carmel, malts, nuttiness and slight hop comes together very well.  Nothing overbearing.  Very drinkable.  I could drink many of these.

2 Poured a light amber color with a little head that leaves some lacing behind. Smells of malts, some hops, but mostly an ether type smell. Taste has a good balance at the presentation till the end where it starts tasting like it smells. Feel is overall pretty smooth. It's a pretty average beer with a different taste.

5            I dunno.  I remember hearing about Double Bag way back in 2005 or so--back in the day, it was possible for malt bombs to generate buzz, believe it or not.  Maybe my pallet has just been destroyed by the extremeness of the modern beer scene, or maybe this was just an off batch.  Either way, I was let down.

2 Overall : For $3.99 it's a decent beer. I wouldn't spend much more than that on it though. At this point to me it's better than High Life. It's got some toasted bread crust flavors and I like that. Try it, you might just like it.

3 The main thing going for it is price...it's cheap.  Consume it as cold as possible...freeze your taste buds.
4                            This was my first beer, sadly. Has to be served ICE COLD just to get it down now.

6 This is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It looks way better than you'd expect, and it pours a surprisingly thick and creamy head.  It actually has some flavor (tasted similar to PBR to me but not nearly as good, kind of a creamed corn taste. Tastes cheap to be sure, but it could be worse) but it could go down much smoother. It's also extremely cheap. This is the perfect beer for kids in college who just want to get drunk.

1 Pours a finger of sudsy, frothy white head, fades quickly to a thin film, and decent spotty lacing. Clear and straw colored. Smells of cereal grains, slightly skunky, very straightforward. Bland taste, with a short bitter hop bite. Slight citric tartness and notes of straw/hay in aftertaste. Feels watery, with higher carbonation. Taste does not linger at all, not that I'd want it to. Overall, I simply can't bring myself to find anything really pleasing or outstanding about this macro. If nothing else, it looks good.

4 Has craft brewing ruined the party?  Check out the legendary Bros rating. 80. Yup 80. Why? How could they? Is it because Miller High Life is, was, and always will be the best party beer on the market?  You can bet your only can of Heady Topper it is.  Try drinking 12 cans of Heady Topper. I guarantee you will puke. Not so with High Life. Light, crisp, slight hop taste with a wet finish. Easily put away 12 of these babies with no sickness or bloated feeling. No headache. High Life deserves more credit. It taught us all how to drink beers.

It has a decent amount barley graininess with some rice like malts. The tinny after taste is tempered and the bubblegum-like sweetness, that I find common in the style, is present but soft.
2 ahead of its peers, but this is a style thats hard to pay much attention too. its cool they brought back an original recipe, and i agree with others that its far less offensive than some other domestic macros, but again, not something i ever really care to drink again. a little more grainy in malt composition than others, less adjuncty ans metallic and sweet than many others, so i like it on those grounds, but it is a little oxidized in the bottle, stale almost, and the hops are almost entirely absent. refreshing enough though with a light body and fine carbonation. i would choose this one over a lot of others in its category, but if i never see one of these again, im not going to be broken up about it. a nod to history, always cool, but the beer remains woefully pedestrian.

I believe it is the best in class. I drink a lot of craft beer, but sometimes I just want a classic lager. Something that my grandfather would have drank. This reminds me of the first sip of beer I ever had. It is head and shoulders above Bud, Miller, and the rest of the competition. This and Yeungling are right at the top for the style.

4 Just really uninspiring shit. The sole resemption lies in that if youre swilling this its probably 3 in the morning, youre probably outdoors, and youre likely surrounded by the worlds most breathtakingly gorgeous humans. Vive Argentina!

6 Taste is slightly sweet and grainy with mild toasted grain and light spice with hint of floral hops and finish is crisp and dry. Overall not the best but mediocre exceeded my expectations to be honest

3 On draft at one of my favorite haunts.   Never seen it and asked ahead of time if it was any good....should have steered clear based on the barmaids response.  Maybe it will get better with this big plate of nachos that I'm about to eat but I doubt it.   I'll be switching up after this one.

2                                       A very crisp, light beer. I'm guessing all the bad reviews are from people who want a bold, slap-in-the-face taste to their beer. Sometimes you drink beer just to get a buzz. If that's what you're after, you could do way worse than rolling rock. I would rank beers like bud light, Coors light, michelob light, nattie light, etc below rolling rock.

But really nothing special, it smells like glass, which is weird because on the bottle it states that it comes from the glass lined tanks of old Latrobe - the power of suggestion perhaps? Overall, i like it but certainly do not love it

6 A most forgettable ale. Where's the flavor and feel? There is so little depth and character that it's difficult to see why this beer is still made.  One is better off with a Budweiser or a nice glass of ice water. Well, my wife goes for this...and I use to settle for this a few decades ago, but I see little reason to go for this beer if other macro American adjuncts are available...

4 Taste is very full for a cheap American lager. Can't compare to a higher quality craft, but if cash is tight Narragansett is a good choice.

1 Only marginally better than average, but still a pretty solid beer
2                                    A nice herby beer from Jamaica.
3     Great bottle for Beersbee (drinking game variation of Frisbee)

1 I have to say that to me this is like the American Heineken (which is a good thing).  You can taste the rice in it, but this will probably end up being my go to home beer since it's so incredibly cheap and it has a very similar flavor profile to Heineken.

4 The skunk mostly rears its head on the very back end.  The look is reasonable, the smell isn't awful, and it's not immediately a regretful decision to drink this beer.  I think the BABros are closer to reasonable than the overall BA score.

2 Brew pours a clear straw-yellow in color with a thin white cap. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of some grassy grains with a light hint of corn. Pretty much the same is said for the taste as well. Lighter-bodied with above average carbonation, that is why all the tiny streaming bubbles. Drinkable but that is about it. Nothing special and is cheap BUT then again you get what you pay for. Typical 'American Adjunct Lager' brew actually with some better than others. Not my type of brew style.

I think rating for look and feel is BS so I give them all 5's.

3 A smooth beer with a nice clear appearance. This is an easy inoffensive brew that will do when required

5 Well - had to try this, it was all the pub had that I hadnât already tried. Pours a clear golden amber with a fluffy and fine-bubbled wheat head. Have to give the big brews credit, they know how to make their pseudo-craft brews look. Strongly fruity and rather sweet aroma has a malty undertone. Flavor, though, is quite good - malty, fruity and hoppy, rather toothsome. Body is about average, though there is decent fizz. Coors, youâre not fooling anybody - but your Batch 19 is at least superior to your other stuff. Gotta give the devil his due. ;)

3 About par for the course. This isnât the worst American adjunct lager Iâve had, but thereâs not much to stand out here. All in all, Iâd rather have an Oly if drinking this style.

6 Pours a clear yellow color with a white head that totally dissipated within 60 seconds. Not much taste at all. I will not buy this again.

3          This is a good cheap beer. It has a very unique taste, which some love but I admittedly don't. Still, looks great and goes down smooth. It also gets points for being brewed in my home state of MN.
4 This is a classic beer, with rich flavor, and an unpretentious reputation originating in Northeast Minneapolis. I rate it so highly based on its simplicity, full flavor, and also quite if bit of nostalgia.

3 It's alright. A good choice if your choices are few. A good cheap beer. Nothing more.

1 I can't be too hard on PBR. For the price, its the best cheap beer out there, and definitely the beer of choice if I just want to get drunk with friends. Definitely outcompetes Nattie Light, Busch Light, and all that other stuff
2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
3                                              I like it as a session beer.  It's not something to sit there and appreciate, just drink it.  As a good friend of mine said, It goes great with punk rock shows and smoking cigarettes.
4         I wanted something cheap and drinkable (Steel Reserve need not apply), and this was the best the gas station had to offer.  I should have spent the exorbitant mark up and got something else.  6 tall boys were 5 too many.
5                                                                                                                      Light and crisp American macrobrewery lager, smells faintly of apples.There's a time and a place for this beer.
6                                                                                                                                                                                  It'll get ya drunk, won't taste good until about 9.

3 Overall- This brought me way back to my days in the Marines, Old Milwaukee beer tents out in the field.  It tasted better back then, but hey it isn't horrible now.

3 Gave it a 2.5 based on nostalgia only. Probably a 2.0 beer. Nothing at all stands out. Kinda musty, almost spoiled tasting. It's like buying Ocean Pacific  brand at Walmart. Not real. You are paying for the label only.
4                                                                                                                                    Pretty typical adjunct lager. Drink it fast because the off flavors show when it warms.

1 Brew pours a straw-yellow in color with a thin white head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of some yeast and grassy hops. Pretty much is said for the taste also. Goes down easy and a semi-dry finish. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. Lighter-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I actually liked this one as I never had it before. Refreshing and would be even better for the warmer months.

3 As a college student, it's been a popular pick-up for parties and for Marylanders for years. Something good for the regular folk. If you're looking for a bud light or Coors alternative, then Boh is the way to Goh!

6 Overall-  I haven't had Labatt Blue in 25 years and i remember it being more shall we say drinkable.  I don't know if my taste buds changed or if they tinkered with the recipe but this is terrible.

3 Poured a very pale straw color with inch of head. Dissipated within 2 minutes.. Smells Absolutely horrid.Slight sappy hops aroma. Hardly any taste at all, slight bitterness. Very Dry almost feels grainy on the tongue. Id drink it if i was thirsty enough.

6 This beer is hard to get where I live, and itÂ´s not that good. I know its very popular in the northern states, but here in central Mexico it has a bad rep.

3 Not realy much of anything as far as aroma or flavor except a slight grassy/grain flavor, very inoffensive but pretty much flavorless.

Weak on smell, taste and body.

3 Taste is light grain and wheat with a touch of lemon.  I would never rush out and purchase this beer as it is slightly above its competitors in the adjunct lager style.  That said, I think this is infinitely more drinkable than Corona and several other Caribbean adjunct lagers. If I was not rating to style, this would come closer to a 2.

Decent light beer though for those summer session drinking days.

3 Tastes of barley and hay. No complexity. I can see myself drinking this in the Australian outback on a hot day. Refreshing on a hot day, but otherwise very ok. I expected more from you Aussies!

1 Oh what the hell. Drank thisw for a short amount of time, wandered away from it. One of those beers that take son a different personality when doctored up with lime and salt, but unadjusted it is a fairly fizzy joint that lacks taste. What's there is corned up and barely bitter. Just not a good thing no matter how you slice it or spice it....

Rancid corn.  No smell.

1 It's flavor almost could take it one step further, leaving just enough for you to want to keep drinking.

6         A solid go to that has just a bit more than the average bear.  Tasty enough for a repeat or two.

4 Out here on Roayan it makes for a crisp, refreshing brew, but nothing I'd buy again for how pricey it is out here on the island.

4 Any beer that requires a lime wedge or salt added to it (or anything else for that matter) isn't worth the time.  If a tall corn stalk could take a piss, it would smell and taste like Corona.

2 Overall 3.25: Good beer.  I am sure this would be like finding an oasis in the desert if you could drink one (or more) of these on a hot day in equatorial Africa, where it is brewed.  This is a good lager and not everyone is fond of, or really appreciates a lager these days...with good reason.  Regardless, this is a refreshing beer and worth a try if you are at a restaurant or at a beer store.

Nothing to hate, nothing to stand out.

1 12 oz can poured into a shaker. Smells buttery and earthy, has some faint hoppy / spicy aroma sneaking in on the back-end, but the sweetness definitely dominates. Pours hazy on the orange side of amber with a thick and foamy eggshell-colored head, lacing is a bit uneven - both large and small lace is present. The taste is medium caramel sweetness with a bit of hoppy bitterness at the swallow. Thereâs also a citrus presence throughout the drink, but I canât quite place it - another review mentioned grapefruit, which seems fair. Relatively light body (considering the caramel / malty flavoring) which finishes creamy smooth with very little (if any) carbonation; however, some of the hoppiness sticks around at the finish; not overwhelming like some IPAâs, but the faint, thin grassy coating of the mouth is reminiscent; in fact, depending on food pairings, it may be beneficial. Thereâs an interesting cheesy flavor (think aged parmesan) that pops up about mid drink as it begins to warms - Iâm still relatively undecided on it, but it does give this beer a uniqueness to it.

This one blew me away. Amazing hop aroma, bright amber/golden color (a little light for an amber but thats hardly a knock). Bitterness is spot on for the abv and malt character. Fantastic!

Strngly hoppy with moderate bitterness.  Relatively dark and large malt load.

6 O: easy to drink; flavor wasn't all that complex; I liked that there was more bittering hops than in most ambers;

6 It's a beautiful amber color. Nasty bitter flavor. Tough to get through, especially for only 6 percent ABV. A buddy left this at my house in January. Maybe it's a year old? Maybe it went bad. I expected better from Rogue. And from Santa.

2 Not much in the nose, but great taste start to finish. Compared to the Ninkasi Red, this wins, no contest.

3 Best way to describe this beer.. CASUAL.. Not a hoppy Amber but it has a smooth malty after taste..

5 Amber / copper body with a thick, khaki hued, sea foam head. Aromas of bready malts, earthy hops, mineral water. Malt forward. Sourdough bread with notes of pine. Moderate bitterness. Medium bodied. Resinous hops linger on the palate. Pretty good.

4 Incredibly malty. Doesn't hide the bite well. Imperial Reds just aren't my thing.

3 Considering that this beer is one of the staples of The Bruery's lineup, it might play second fiddle to many of their seekers. Don't miss out; this one is a true gem.

2 Overly carbonated with too much of a sour bite on first taste. Weak flavors throughout with a disappointing finish. Not great.

1 I liked this. Poured it from a bottle in my  glass at home. A nice rich copper clear look with a off white nice head. Carbonation is low which is fine. A slight bread malt smell that stays with the taste with a hint of citrus for a subtle nice combination mouth feel. The foam head holds up well and provides nice lacing. Bought it with a mix and match six pack and will buy again.

Nice smell of hops but lacked the taste to back it up.

3 O: I'm a big fan of hoppy reds, but this one is kinda disappointing. A bit too malty for me despite the load of hops. My bottle was pretty fresh and had bite so I'm not sure how much has faded out, but I can imagine this being better super fresh. For now it's just ok.

3 Disappointed by this beer that really seems to be trying to do too much.

3 Tastes good, but a little uneven.  Pine up front, grapefruit in the middle, pine and a bit of yeast at the back end.  One of the most aggressively hoppy reds I've ever come across, and while it was enjoyable the lack of balance holds it back.

3 Feel is light and easy to drink. A nice refreshing beer that's not too heavy to enjoy on a hot day. Exactly what a red should be.

5 On tap at rock 'n brews El Segundo poured into nonic pint glass. Red amber in color with off-white head that clings. Smells of passion fruit and booze. Tastes about the same with good crisp pine and carbonation.

4 six pack from Winter Haven ABC - good, but I was a little disappointed after all the hype.

5 Pours an amber transparent. Light carbonation. Smells a bit astringent with malty tones.  Taste is an even throughout subtle malt with slight biscuity aftertaste. Taste gets slightly more malty with warming temps. Definite caramel finishing yet still more biscuity in my batch. Enjoyable beer.

2 This is a great beer to ease into a darker beer. The light amber nodes give the beer a toffee and caramel taste. I love this beer with a nice piece of steak with sauteed mushrooms. Highly recommend this beer...then ease into Bell's Two Hearted!

2 Had this beer some time ago entering it here just to catalog it. Oak flavor was way too strong and just plain tasted wierd to me. Have tried many Sam Adams beers but finding one I like is rare.

5 Overall:  This is a very good American version of an Oktoberfest beer.  Great balance between malt, sweetness and subtle hops.  Iâll definitely pick up a few bottles next year.

2 Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth as it slides across the tongue with ease and the mild carbonation lets it go down like a milk stout, as the body is medium with a slight chewy feel but it's thin and watery at the same time. Good beer that I'd like to try again from a glass to get the full experience.

6 Terrible. Nothing at all going on here as far as taste or smell. No hops, no malt, no alcohol, nothing. Was even a little skunky. Bridgeport is very unimpressive brewery.

3 Somehow I kept passing over Full Sail even though it's widely available and I kept meaning to try it.  So I finally did.  It's your basic amber, which at this point almost seems a little boring compared to some of the experiments that are out there, but sometimes you just want a good solid beer, and this fits the bill.  Nicely balanced, not heavy at all, very drinkable.

2 Pours a light amber hue with a white head that recedes to a ring.  Aroma of alcohol and stale grains.  The taste has faded caramel, lemon juice, and faint bitterness.  Not the best tasting beer for style fairly abrasive actually.  Has an oxidized note of sherry.  Hop flavor helps somewhat.  Light bodied, cardboard dry and not moreish in the slightest.  Overall, not too good.

5 Overall - A spot on red. Nice balance from the hops and malts. Worth a go if you stumble across this one.

4 A good to very good beer.  Red in color with a  one finger head that reduces to a film of bubbles covering the enter top of the beer throughout.  Liked the flowery hoppy backbone.  Needed more IPA type punch.  Smell of flowery hops and a bit of malt.  Solid Red IPA.  Smooth.

3 Not bad. Not my favorite style but the malty red is an easy drinker

4 Golden and light amber. Half finger off-white head with low retention and spotty lacing. Lightly spicy aroma, some maltiness, some floral notes. Not very aromatic in general. Tastes of coriander and moderate bitterness accompanied by a malty finish. Smooth mouth feel with some carbonation. Somewhat acidic feel on front of tongue. Leaves a mildly drying sensation, with very slight chewy character. Overall, good winter style ale that is not overwhelming to palate and easy drinking. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable nonetheless.

Pours brilliant copper tinted amber with a 1â finely bubbled, lacy white foam cap. The palate is creamy, fruity, with some bread, citrus and light melon. Light sweetness on entry that dries out by the finish with light traces of astringency. It has a medium body and carbonation. The carbonation is natural and not harsh. Easy to drink.

There is cheaper stuff out there that is similar (Busch Signature Copper Lager). Overall I would recommend it.

4 Notes: Clear, brown body beneath a thin, short-lived head of off-white. Lacing is average. Aroma expresses dark caramelish malt with a hint of nuttiness and some background hops. The flavor follows suit, and it's basically a straightforward lager with a solid caramel component. Light-medium in body and gently crisp. Moderate bitterness. It finishes fairly short and dry. Given the price it's hard to argue against it as a fall-back beer, at least for one or two while watching a game or cooking dinner... times when you don't want to focus on your beer, when you just want something refreshing at hand. This is a beer I'd buy for a backyard BBQ just so that the newbie beer drinkers can try something other than Yuengling Traditional.

Decent head with some lacing; slight murky amber body. Good start with crystal malt and caramel but doesn`t hold my interest. Still, for the price point, way better than a bland BMC.

1 Love the beer. The problem comes with the inconsistancy in the flavor.

4 O- Great lager to sip on while munching on a steak. Typical lager sweetness (without the corny notes of an adjunct) nicely balanced with a bit of hops. Extremely drinkable.

6 The hops shine through and make up for the fruity flavors that ale yeast would usually supply with fresher flavors.

6 Great beer, very traditional for an English style red ale in my opinion. I enjoy this brew and is a great palate builder for newbies

5 OVERALL:  sometimes I think AB wants to delve into craft brewing, this would be like dipping your big toe into the deep end of the pool.  It's a step in the right direction but does not go far enough for me.  This is a decent beer, not unlike Sam Adams Boston Lager, just not as good.  Since there are better options available I would not seek this out again.

The finish is rather bitter and tinny and there's an overwhelming metallic bubblegum taste.

3 It doesn't taste BAD, it just doesn't really taste great. A little watery for me.
4                        i had this beer with a burger and it was not a bad pairing

2 I Pop!, er, unscrewed the cap, just to show you the relevancy A-B/INBEV gives to its G-F consumers. An aggro pour netted a finger of foamy, light-tan head with lousy retention. Bye, Felicia! Nose had a musty, caramel apple smell. I thought of ice cream for some reason. Nowhere as sharp as Green's, but where would these guys be if they didn't polish the s**t out of their beers? Nowhere!

6 It's a shame this beer needs refrigerating throughout all of its life, I'd love to see it makes its way down to the deep south.  A beer I would always keep handy for sporting events and get-togethers.

1 Good Amber color.  Smooth taste with strong lager finish.  Nice compliment to Bud stable.

4 Really nice amber, super crisp from the lager yeast, some hop notes present.  Had it at the brewery and I was impressed

5 Basically an average at best beer. Nothing about it really stands out, and the funky aftertaste doesn't help matters. There are better beers out there.

3 Meh. Being organic is a selling point and this makes a nice companion to this brewery's original organic pale lager (see that review). Safe, should appeal to the masses and those just venturing forth into Sleeman's or Rickard's land from paler climes.

4 Definitely on the sweeter side but not necessarily a bad thing. Malt aftertaste

3 Schell's Dark pours a clear amber color with a nice size lacing head.  There is a weak aroma, some roasted malts.  The taste is light, nice noticeable roasted malt flavor.  Weak body, a little flat.  Overall its not great, nothing special, but it is a decent beer.

5 8/11...pours deep amber, very light layer of foam that settles out. Reddish. Rich caramel nose with malt. Taste is a higher malt concentration, lightly sweet, bready, and toffee too. Mild carbonation. Very smooth, backed with a tasty malt profile.

3 I always look for local brews when I travel. The store down the road only had Mojave Red, and I can honestly say I really enjoy it. I'm not always a lager drinker, but it's smooth and balanced. I will definitely keep this in mind for the next time I am out in the Mojave area.

6 An okay amber lager that lacks any distinctive qualities. The flavor is a let down, lacking some of the malt depth suggested by the aroma. Worth exploring but I'm moving on...

6 Overall: I love OHB they make amazing offerings for this state. However this is not one of them. I know they plan on doing more releases in the future of the more regular offerings and maybe they will offer up some of their stouts in six packs, because that is really where this brewery shines.

1 Very easy to drink with a slight hint of hoppiness that nicely balances out the sweeter honey flavour.

4 nice burnt orange color body, hoppy aroma,  good bitter pine hop forward with a little lager on the back of the tongue.  Very good, enjoyable beer.

2                     Super refreshing beer! Great for enjoying outside by the pool.
3 Spicy, malty notes on the nose, smooth feel, nice balanced flavor. Good with food.
4                                                   Love this beer and this brewery!

4 A phenomenal flavor, completely unexpected after the noise. Great Mouthfeel, and a rich dark amber color.

It's a swell brew, however, for a barley wine with a name as such it fell short. The complexity of a barley wine leaves a lot of room for creativity. In this case, the name trumps the drink.

5 22 ounce wax capped bottle, 2013 vintage.  Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a hazy ruby red/copper color with about an inch and a half frothy tan head that stuck around a long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like caramel, dark fruit, bready/grainy malt, candied fruit, and some apples.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of toffee, citrusy hops and some booziness.  Nice mix between the malty and bitter hoppy flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit syrupy and slick with moderate carbonation.  I think this is a good barleywine, I'm glad I tried this one!

This one was just too timid, neither hoppy nor sweet, lacking in flavor depth and feel depth. just kinda there. Boulder needs to go a lot bigger on this barley wine.

5 Great balance between tasty hops and solid malts, both really rich and strong, without one overpowering the other.
6                                                  Overall - Despite a lot of negativity, I really enjoyed this one.

4 Good sipper not a daily drinker heavy and the alcohol hits heavy, it is nice that they have released this in 12oz bottles now, as it is much more manageable to have one with another lighter beer.

3                            Starts out nice including the flavor, but it is boozy.  Way too boozy.

5 Caged and corked poured into tulip glass. Strong whiskey aroma and boozy flavor - a bit too much.

2 This seems to have aged well. It is smooth, well-balanced, and free of any musty or other off characteristics.  Two years seems like a sweet spot on this one, though at 10.6 abv, it could probably do 2 more and still be delicious.

Smell is pungent hops, alcohol, black licorice, strawberry, and a minor cofffe note. Taste is hoppy up front, sweet fruit in the middle, and a lingering bittersweet oily finish.  Mouthful is medium with medium carbonation.  Overall a nice beer but not what i was expecting from a barleywine.

Flavor has hops upfront followed by burnt sugar/ caramel and orange marmalade finish. Tasty. strong. A beer with character.
5 Velvet hammer here. Appearance is a large, long lasting, tan to cream-colored, thick head, plenty of lace, and a clear, dark amber hue. Aroma is leather, dark ripe fruit, dark malt, yeast, hops, and lumber. Flavorâs similar to nose, with sweet being up front and bitter heavy in the finish and just right carbonic tang to balance. Body is good, but the heavy bitter yields some coarseness. Ditto for the finish, with some off flavors, though overall, Iâd definitely have, just not right away. I'd be especially curious to try it with some aging.

1 Bottled 12-20-2012, poured 4-6-15.  Even after 2+ years, the bitterness on this is still strong.  I normally get a raisin sweetness from a barleywine, but the prevalent bitter notes made it more like honey.  Very well made, but as it warmed, the bitterness became too strong for my palate.

1 Overall good beer but at 25 bucks a pop, not worth the price. There were some off flavors that detracted from the beer reaching elite status. Glad to have tried it and always intrigued to get my hands on anything Great Divide releases.

5                       This is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. I did this beer a disservice by holding on to it this long. Im sure it was better when fresher...if you have one of these, drink it within a year or 2, dont hold on to it too long.
6 Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, malts. Taste is malty, alcohol, dark fruits, easy drinking considering the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer.

2 Thin with too much hop character and not enough malt. Dssapointing given how much I've enjoyed other HotD beers.

1 Little bit of sediment floating around. Pours  doo doo brown in color. Taste is fantastic! Malty and lots of barley character. First beer I had in Vermont on my vacation last week.

I am a Barleywine fan and a Barleywine drinker.  I can drink more than one in a single sitting, but Iâm not so sure about this one.  With my fiancÃ© not here to help me polish this bomber off, Iâm not so sure itâs going to happen.  However, it is a very enjoyable beer, especially with a little St. Agur Blue Cheese.

There was almost no head on it. The nose is pretty good. Caramel, dark fruits, perhaps some rum raisin notes. The taste is OK. caramel, raisin, some dark fruits. Minimal sweetness with a small touch of dryness in the finish. Itâs good, but just seems to be missing something I canât quite put my finger on.

6 22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a small dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. A bit strong on fruitiness, but not bad. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light amount of earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good barelywine style. All around good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.

Definitely worth a shot at $5 for a bomber.
4 Poured a clear copper body with one finger head and left a lace ring around glass.  Aroma is a little boozy, with touches of dark fruits (figs, prunes).  Hoppy beer, smooth, medium strength body, little bit of heat on the finish. a little sticky from the malts, mostly some toffee or caramel sweetness and these balance with citric, hoppy, earthy flavors and touches of dark fruits.  Pretty well built and strong, holds up and I like the extra hop notes.

6 Appearance: brilliant chestnut to garnet mahagony with a finely bubbled, lacy off white foam cap. Smell: Citrusy hoppy nose. Taste: rich, malty, some caramel, bread, cardamom to cola finishing with a big bitter hop finish balanced by the malt and alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy, big and chewy, slight warming. Overall: Reminds me of a mixed drink.

The tartness somehow works with the pumpkin and brady barrel. Not sure if this an infection or a Brewers intention but it works.
6 a strong presence of pumpkin spice is the dominant flavor with very mild brandy barrel. doesn't really taste much like a barleywine but more like a pumpkin ale.. .also this must be the mildest 12% beer I've ever had.. alcohol is not perceivable. overall this has a nice balance and mouth feel and delivers good pumpkin spice flavor... one of the better pumpkin beers out there

3 Murky craft.  Imagining unfiltered raisin/prune juice.  Very aromatic and lush.  Gummy bear, hops and raisin standout.  Taste of hop and sweet.   Soon after a peasantly sour mixed with a bitter effect and the higher abv blending in comfortably.  Mouthfeel has hop bitterness lingering in back of the mouth.  Sugars lay on the tongue.  Overall this is really a treat.  Not one component outdoes the other.  Well done.

This is much more hop forward throughout, with less sweetness than typical Barleywines. As it warms the alcohol comes out, but is masked early on. A terrific beer than I would gladly drink again!

3 Nice fruity aroma when opened.  Mine said 2013 on the label.  Overall pretty good and solid barleywine for the price.

1 Appearance: copper color very clear. Lacking a full head. Head diminished quickly. Great lacing. Smell: bitter. Almost a not so good burnt oil smell. Slightly floral but overpowering bitterness. Taste: too bitter for a barley wine. Similar to Sierra Nevada hop hunter. Floral hoppy finish but bitterness, even for a high ibu lover, was unpleasant. Feel: very light not typical of barley wine. Too much carbonation. Overall: not great. Not impressed.

4 Pours a beautiful brown coating with a very thin off-white head that dissipates rather quickly into the abyss of fine barleywine. Aroma gives off a phenomenal smell of pure barleywine - wood,  sweet figs, and slight alcohol. The flavors replicate the aromatic qualities very well along with toffee and raisins. By grace, this is a delicious beer! This is just a tad below Cigar City's Leon, but a cut above Steel Toe's Lunker - both world-class bourbon barrel barleywines in my book! Very impressive coming out of a brewery that is well known for IPA centric beers.

Having a '12 and '09 vintage, the fresher bottle was much better. A beer that really does live up to its hype.

4                         O: Overall sweet, syrupy, sticky with warming citrus-alcohol notes. Strong visual and aroma, solid flavor and a great sipper ovet the long haul that reveals layers of spectrum over warming.

6 Not sure why anyone would sleep on Ale Smith. But don't if you do . . . This is a delicious barleywine. Toffee, caramel and other subtle sweet flavors come together to make this more than another enjoyable sipper.

3 They say this is a nice one to bottle age, but who has the patience for that? This stuff is so good, so mellow & so gone in 60 seconds.

5 One of the best barley wines I have tasted in a while. Me and my friend always ask for it when we go to a store together. Plus, my buddy loves the high ABV barley wines so this one does the trick at 15%. Very tasty, not too malty as some barley wines tend to be.

4 Dark brown with thin tan head. Aroma of raisins malt and booze. Taste is boozy malty dried prunes, raisins and molasses. Finish is hint of bitter and caramel.

1 Well I remember this one, and I remember not being a big fan. Not incredibly well balanced, bitterness that didn't correspond with the nose of a hop characteristic that left an odd cloying sweet bitterness behind with a little rubbing alcohol. Just not much I could enjoy with this one.

3 Dark copper color, almost completely opaque. Clean sharp mouthfeel with a subtle hoppy aftertaste. Taste is deep and complex with strong coffee notes and hints of caramel and plum.

1 Pours a deep black with a tan head, about what I expected for this style. Smell is.....MANGO and pineapple, wow I wasnt expecting that. Flavor is malty beer with citrus and pine, fucking fantastic!

5 Looks like a thin black lager, smells like a double IPA and tastes like a pure black IPA. It is a keeper for me.

1 I didn't really know what to expect from a Black IPA. I've had a few different black beers before, and i've had many different IPA's. Never together, and now I know why. Best way I can describe this is burnt citrus. Unappetizing for me. Literally one of the only beers I've not been able to finish and found it's way down the drain. I'm glad it was just part of the 4-way IPA variety pack I bought and not a 6 pack of just this!

Very mild hop and malt aroma. Dark red cola color. Hoppy, fruity and bitter. Malt is way overshadowed by the hops. Aftertaste fades quickly for the IBU level. Not bad but would probably only drink this when I am also eating something to contrast the hops.

2 I did not like this beer. It looks good and smells alright. But tasted mildly bitter, malty and ashy. I am a big fan of Sierra Nevada. Maybe black ales are not for me.

2                                                  This beer has what I enjoy in a black IPA; crispness, slightly smoky but easy to drink without being overpowered with any of the malts or hops.

6 So thin. No foreward taste of much. It all kinda blends. I do like the carbonation of it though- it's kinda like Sri Lanka: not as latent as a stout or porter, still stays in touch with India.

2 Black in color but still somewhat penetrable to light.  An inch of tightly knit foam comprised of tiny bubbles is resting on top.  Heavy lacing is present.  Amazing aroma of citrus hops greets the nose.  There's undercurrent of dark malt.  The taste is of bitter piney hops on the front of the palate.  The back of the palate is dark malt.  It finishes with a bitter flourish of more piney hops.  The mouth is initially creamy and then very dry and lightly sticky.  There's a lot going on here.  Why is this being discontinued again?

A pretty heavy beer.

3 I really tried to like this, but it just wouldn't happen. Too bad too, as I have liked many brews from BrewDog. Just had some off-putting flavor to me. Maybe an old bottle? Oh well, going to try their Cocoa Psycho next.

1 From bottle dated 1/27/15. Second tasting of a MBC beer. This is a black IPA and the bottle should state it that way, it was described to me as such before purchase. Dark pour with a thicker viscosity, 2 finger tab foam, laced and held the glass throughout. Very nice caramelly, smoky hop smell. A piney hop flavor hits the mouth up front and the rich malt settles in the back followed by a little bitter bite. A few seconds later the rich, woody malt flavor lingers. Overall a very good, not great, offering for a dark IPA, would purchase again without a doubt but want to try the other Maine beers first.

Similar to other black ipas.  Hoppy and bitter.  Didn't care for it. Very dry.  Not a lot of complex flavors.  Just sort of there.

3 This is another delicious beer by Firestone Walker.  A darker style IPA, with some subtle Rye pepperiness...but candidly, in a blind taste test, I think most would just call it a near perfect IPA.  I love the look in the glass, and even better in my mouth!  These Brewers have established themselves as a personal favorite of mine, and I can't wait to try all their beers.  Check the dates and get them as fresh as possible.  Credit to the Brewers for making the dating so clear and straightforward...it makes a difference, IMO.

Stout-like. First sip though not nearly as hoppy as hoped.   Unexpected dry finish, only slightly bitter with heavy coffee notes.

5 Appearance: Brilliant deep dark beown with a 1â light tan foam cap that produces light lace. Smell: Smells like a light chocolate cola with races of hops. Taste: Very creamy palate chocolate, cola, anise â the hops give the chocolate a bittersweet character. Mouthfeel: Medium full body, medium carbonation, fine and soft, creamy.

2 Pours pitch black with a thin foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are mild.  Has a malty, licorice, raisin aroma.  Smooth, silky taste.  Can definitely taste licorice, maybe some slight chocolate and raisins.  You can definitely detect the booziness.  It has a slightly astringent aftertaste with some hoppy bitterness.  Good beer, but not much of a black licorice fan.

1 Some roasted malt and slight coffee.  Earthy, pine, dirt notes come through with the bitterness at a nice level.

1 Look is dark and creamy, but the feel is not creamy. Not a whole lot as far as smell goes. Expected more hoppiness. Smooth, bitter taste as expected. Overall a good Ipa!
2                                                                                                                                                                          
3           Strong aroma hops with hints of roasted malts. Dry on the palate with strong smokey toasted malts, almost on the verge of ashy flavors from off roasting temps.
4                                                                                                                                                                          
5        Black draft pour, beige head with great lacing. Hop nose. Smooth malt foundation balances hops. Medium lite mouthfeel with bitter tongue coating. Tasty black IPA.

5 Overall:  A fantastic Black IPA.  Impressive considering I am enjoying this past the best by date.  The high ABV provides some warmth but does not overpower.  All of the components are balanced  very well.

1 On tap at FFF brewpup. Pours dark brown with thin tan head. Aroma of prunes/dates, tobacco, roasted hops. Similar flavors with hints of grapefruit citrus.

3 Overall a tasty, complex beer combining some great features of a dark malty beer with the pungent bite of hops. Well balanced, and ABV well hidden amidst the flavors.

6 This pours a warming dark cola-black with cocoa foam. I get an upfront roasty malt profile with a pronounced roast on the palate cut by some bitterness and a touch of piney grapefruit hops. Itâs malty and more sweet than dry, with enough going on to place it in my mind as more âhoppy porterâ than âblack IPA.â Tasty and enjoyable even as it warms.

3 Overall, I'm not sure what to think. Racer 5 IPA is one of my favorite IPAs out there, and had high expectations for this beer. I was planning on doing a taste test between this and Sublimely Self-Righteous, but think i'm gonna save that one for tomorrow. Maybe this beer had a different, and maybe better profile a year ago. I will have to try a fresher bottle and maybe re-review at a later date.

4 I thought this ale was a mess. It looked good in the glass and that was about it. Medicinal taste, off-putting.  And I really like black IPAs.  Maybe I got a bad batch.

2 Pours to a black color with brownish-red tints when viewed against light.  The head is a pale cream color with minimal retention.  Delicate lacing left on the glass.  Some hop-like aromas up front, but with a definite malty character.  The flavor is a near perfect balance of malt and hops.  The carbonation and body are ideal.  Feels great going down.  I've had much of the catalogue produced by Lakefront, but my first time trying this one.  They do a great job with a lot of different recipes and didn't disappoint on this one.  Reasonable price too, 6-pack for $7.99

2 It was more of a dark reddish color than an IPA and the taste was not what you would expect from and IPA.

2 An extremely dark IPA, imagine a stout's maltiness with a rich IPA hop presence. Very different but delicious.

5 Beer poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours pitch black with a light brown head that disappears quickly. Smells of coffee and some hops, but weak. Tastes of some flowery hops and coffee, nice combination. Beer is light bodied, nicely carbonated, good finish. Overall, an above average beer.

4 Overall-  I was honestly expecting more hop action coming from this brew. it's bitter and has a slightly floral/citrusy hop presence but it's pounded by the malt. this beer reminds me of I think it's anger by greenbush brewery and nighttime by lagunitas. it's playyyyyed! maybe it's the style TO ME but all these black ipa's seem the same. drinkable but nothing special. if you're looking for more of a dark malt driven showcase with some slight hop action this is a beer for you. I just prefer hop explosion.

6 Very tasty. Tastes like a lighter beer even in the IPA Adventure pack.

5 This pours a semi-hazy, straw yellow color with a slight white head. The aroma is grassy/grainy. The flavor is well-balanced for the style with the prefect texture. There is a decent amount of earthy, organic flavors. It finishes with a lingering, grassy grain flavor. Interesting and yet quite simple.

2 Had at Logan, where the options are always disappointing, and this did not disappoint in its disappointment.  This has all the characteristics of a macro - so in that regards, if sales take off, they are ready.  It has little smell or taste.  I gave it a strong score for Look, as I am wearing my favorite sweater today, and I think the beer looks good next to me.  Overall, this is very much a beer, so good work Shipyard.

It's been seven years, so I guess time may have warped my memory. It seems to be skunked, but I bought it at my go to store which is reputable and has fresh product. Either I remember a bad beer as good, or it got skunked along the way.

However, it has a weak hop profile and tastes kind of like wort rinse...

I like it, but prefer Prelude from Shipyard. A pretty good beer.

5 Light, crisp and refreshing.  Could crush this all day.  Not huge in the flavor department, but on a hot day or while playing golf, it would do the trick.

2                                       They really did nail it. Probably the best non-dark spiced beer I've ever had. Well integrated and nothing artificial about the flavors. The mouth feel is velvety, lending itself well to the vanilla. Makes me want to try White Chocolate.
3 The smell is kind of awful. I don't know what I'm about to get when I stick it under my nose, but then I taste it and BAM, there's the cinnamon, rice, and vanilla that you know is horchata! Is it the best beer ever, maybe not, but did they nail what it's supposed to be? Yes.

1 Flavor is so minimal, essentially water with some beer in it. I guess I get the point

1                                        I may not be a big fan of this style, but this doesn't even taste like a blonde ale, and unfortunately doesn't taste like a very good beer at all.  Drinkable, but a beer that comes off like a bit of an identity crisis, as it just seems like something that was hastily thrown together with no plan.

4 Sweet Baby Jesus is soooo good I guess I had high hopes for the 2nd product I've found from DuClaw. I think it was just an average American Ale priced above some other average American Ales. I am having a hard time hating this because SBJ is so unique and original but I was not impressed enough to even explain my rating. Sorry DuClaw.

5 O: I would never guess this is a Firestone Walker beer, it's an introduction to craft and I could see adjunct beer drinkers digging this, definitely not for me, I like more in my beer but this would make great lawnmower beer, it's light, easy drinking, nothing overwhelming, balanced. Probably won't buy this again as I think Easy Jack is a better value.

1 Considering this a brett-ed saison brewed with corn and rice. Pours a cloudy straw color, billowing soapy whit head, settles slowly to a half inch; sheet of thick lace down the glass. Smell: floral, hay, lemony and spicy, moderate amount of barnyard bouquet, hint of dough I'm the back. Taste: lemon, pineapple note, grainy...breakfast cereal, sugar cookie note, into a dry finish highlighting a big spicy and somewhat rindy hopping. This drinks light and refreshing, but the carbonation is really dialed in well to provide heft and lasting power at lower grav. Really well done...the brett adds a lot to all aspects of the beer vs Classique.

It tastes like a mocha drink. Most who are into that style of flavor would probably love it though. It's just not my thing.

6 Poured from bottle to pint glass. Pale, pale yellow with a little head. No lacing. Smells of coffee and cream, slight bitterness, roasted sweet caramel. Taste follows, sweet coffee with a tiny bite on the end. Mouthfeel is thin, could be a perception thing since I was expecting something thicker to go along with the coffee flavor. Little to no aftertaste.

4 Rated this as a Blonde Ale, not an Extra Pale Ale as ABW classifies it as. Not bad, pretty average.

2 D: This was an interesting brew, but the scent and taste weren't super well composed. The body was nice, but the finish wasn't very smooth, so it was not incredibly easy to drink. Doesn't seem like the sort of beer you would want to age, but maybe a few years could help this one gel and mellow. Fresh is not worth having more than once.
3                                      Pours an orange like color.  White head and lacing.  Aroma of potpourri herbs and citrus.  Citrus and vanilla in the flavor blending with spicy herbs.  A clash of flavor.  Slightly acidic, though short lived and Medium bodied, well carbonated.  Semi dry.  Weird beer.  The flavors didn't really work.

5 I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I got it on tap a bit late for the season, but I thought it to be a good, crisp, tasty brew.  I'd definitely get it again.  It's very smooth going down.

4 Overall : A notch better than the average brand having a little more taste and body.

2 Overall: Light and refreshing, but with some nice hops to add character and crispness.

4 Good. Happy I tried. Would not seek again, but I've seen it in spots where if I had to make choice---it would be my buy.

1                             Refreshing taste. Best if it's almost frozen.
2 Citrus smell and taste, goes down easy.  Great beer for a hot summer day.
3                                      Great tasting beer.. Very refreshing

3 Refreshing, light beer. Enjoyed the mild hops and liked that carbonation.  Not big on mouth feel, but didn't expect it from this type of ale. Would definitely buy again if on sale for a lawnmower beer or grilling beer. And the bottles are great to save for home brewing.

6 Clear golden purity in the glass. Pours with minimal head. Tastes like cereal, a lot like wheaties or total.

4 Didn't enjoy the taste, not as sweet as it could have been. May have been an old bottle.

It is not.
4 Pours a clear medium gold,with bubbles rising long afterwards, producing slightly more than a finger of frothy, shortlived, off-white head that leaves little lace. Aroma is very thin, a little cracker & pale malts, faintly fruity, a little citrus & faint grass. The wheat is detectable as an afterthought. Taste is thin biscuit & bready malts, some light toast & fruit, yeast, some wheat in the background providing a faint hint of banana in the lemon & bitter finish which intensifies in the bitter, mineral, chemical aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not quiet watery, moderate-high carbonation, crisp, prickly & dry. Overall a little disappointing with low drinkability for a Blonde Ale, a brew style with the reputation of being thirst quenching & easy to drink.

2 Not very good. Honestly I think I would prefer a Coors light. Still like Ska though

2 This was a good beer overall. I'm not totally sure about the metallic taste, but otherwise this is a decent brew that I would be willing to drink again.

2 The smell of this can be a bit off putting, but the taste is excellent!

3 Aroma is floral, lightly citrusy, with a deeply toasted malt backbone that is accented by hints of chocolate and a touch of roast. There's a bit of caramel sweetness. Flavor reveals more floral hop character throughout, with a deeply toasted, nutty malt backbone. The finish is resiny and fairly bitter. Notes of muted grapefruit counter light chocolate initially. There's a bit of an offputting perfumey character in the aftertaste. Not quite the brew I remember. Too bitter and perfumey flavor for my liking. The aftertaste of medicinal/harsh bittering hops kills it for me.

5 Too hazelnut forward and watery on the down swing. A little too sweet as well. Just not to my liking as much as it is to the rest of the bell curve.

1 12 Oz bottle in point glass.  Medium brown with a thin team head.   Mild malt aroma.  Tastes a little sweet and caramel malty, but we'll balanced.   Not as burnt as some brown ales.   Neeson bodied. A good,  easy drinking brown.

1 Overall, the uniquness of this beer was worth the try. The combination of earthy notes with hops made it fairly interesting.

5 Pours a very deep mahogany in color with a thin beige head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of malts and burnt brown sugar. Bit more going on with the taste as there is a hint of maple and cocoa also. Very smooth and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Medium-bodied though a bit thin. Lower carbonation. Overall a tasty brown ale.

Has an earth taste that was enjoyed very much.

4 Very smooth.  Very different from anything I had before.  The color looked like a standard brown ale and there wasn't a really distinct smell from what I could gather.  Taste wasn't bad, but isn't something I would crave a lot.  Good beer to mix it up with, but not something I would consistently buy.  Worth buying if you want to try something unique.

No exception here, either I really hate the taste of hemp or this is just a bad beer. Bitter with a poor mix of hops and malt.

2 This is a real treat. Anymore, it seems that brewers like to add to many American hops to bitter their browns, but this one is well-balanced between malty goodness with just enough hops to really make it a winner in my book.

No. It is rather an extrapolation of the style. I must admit myself suspicious of the term 'double' applied to a brown ale, but this certainly justifies the term. It remains Brown Ale-like, and does not spread into the real of porter or strong ale. Nutty, malty, gorgeous. Yum.
2 Appearance: Brilliant mahogany, chestnut, 2â light tan tinted white foam cap dissipates to thick film, excellent lace. Smell: aniseed, thick dark bread, fruit cake, faint chocolate. Taste: Starts rich and malty and then dries out and gets espresso coffee astringent and lingers in the finish. Mouthfeel: Creamy smooth with an astringent background that rises in the after taste. Medium carbonation to medium low â carbonation is very fine, very soft and very well done. Medium full body.

Lots of flavor, great looking beer with a creamy head and awesome lacing. Mouthfeel is great. I know I rated this higher than others but compared to other brown ales out there I think this rating is justified.

1 Overall - Although I stated I am not much of a fan of amber or brown beers, this is a really good example of the style. I am very impressed with this beers flavor, balance, and complexity. Overall a very solid brew, I think it is a bit underrated.

6 Dark brown in color with a fingernail of beige head.  Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of hazelnuts and amber malt.  The flavor is strongly comprised of hazelnuts and amber malt.  There might be some piney hops but they are overwhelmed by the hazelnut and amber malt intensity.  The mouth is very dry and crisp.

1 It's just ok. Wouldn't get it again. If it was offered to me at a friend's house, I'd accept if there wasn't any others available.

3    This is not a terrible beer, but nothing special either. There is something off about the taste that I don't particularly like.

6 Maybe I'm just not really into Brown ales but every time I have this beer I like it a little less. Super bubbly and large head. Dark brown color. Very malty. Very very roasty. Almost a burnt ash-tray kind of finish. Has a pretty smooth mouthfeel. It is pretty drinkable but not totally impressive.

I'm not tasting any oak barreling. It's OK. My nephew sent me a bunch of these 3 months ago as part of an NFC championship wager. At the time I really liked em . now It's more like, What was I thinking ?  This last one was sitting in my fridge waiting for me to review it. Perhaps it went bad?

6 Dark brown in color with plenty of light seeping through when held up to the light.  A moderate amount of minute sediment is suspended within the body.  A fingernail of off white to light beige foam covers the vast majority of the top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of chocolate, hazelnut and dark malt.  The flavor is muted than the nose would indicate.  It is mostly dark malt and hazelnut.  I do detect a hint of the sweet bourbon in the aftertaste.  The mouth is dry and sticky.

4 This is a very nice black ale.  Malty, with a hint of tangy hoppiness, along with a  taste of black licorice.  Excellent!
5                    I like it and would pick up another sixer.  It's a Wisconsin brewery.   I like to support local brews!

3 carbonation kills it...partly. toasty/nutty aroma & taste. but overall a strange taste complexion, just doesn't work well. the sharpness of the carbonation does not help. looks nice though

6 This was a decent beer. Probably not something I would buy again, but worth trying once.

1 O - Another solid beer from Short's. The booziness is a tad strong and this could good be great with some aging.

5 Pours the color and thickness (or thin) of black plain coffe.  Head dissipates quick.  Smells hoppy.  Tastes hoppy for a brown ale, but I think it was supposed to.   Overall a decent beer but nothing I would go out of my way for.

1 O- one of the more flavorful brown ales that Iâve had in a while, sweet, malty & nutty as a brown ale should be

5                                     It is a very average brown ale. It tastes like beer but is nothing special.

4  I swear this beer is way more sour on tap. It is probably a difference in age of batch. I cannot make out the bottling date or batch number. The stamp is partially missing. i never had that problem with the stickers. Anywho, this is another quality beer from Jolly Pumpkin. They rarely disappoint. I was hoping for more sour, but I still like it a lot.

2 Review for CHAI BROWN not currently on BA but want to track all my beers in 2015. Saranac was one of my first craft beers over 20 years ago! Surprisingly liked the chai brown, more of a holiday beer. Nice dark brown flavor and strong spiced aroma. Good spice vs brown malt combo, neither overwhelms the other, taste settles evenly and lingers in the mouth. Well worth a try, this was a good,standard consumer beer.

5                 I had the chance to meet the brewer when I was there. Seems to be a good guy with great ideas.
6  O - I love this style of beer and this is worth a try. Nothing that knocks your socks off, but a decent brew.

Nicely carbonated.  Not a  bad beer  but one that also provides a check in the box for my103 beer style!!!!
2 On tap at at Molly's in Hanover NH. A dark Amber pour with a bit of head that lingers and makes for a decent pattern of lacing. An interesting scent, and I'm not sure what to expect....maltiness? Or Hoppiness? I get both. A unique combo of toasted malt and piney bitterness, with a touch of pineapple fruit. For a session ale, which I often find lacking for flavor, this stood up nicely. I would have liked a bit more carbonation, but overall this was a perfectly decent, and original beer that I would try again.

There is a solid malt foundation in both the nose and the flavor, but it doesn't seem to stand up to the hops, which come across as completely separate from the malty base, especially in the aftertaste. Hops are a bit too minerally and slightly metallic.

Nose is slightly burnt toast, caramel malts, and a faint herbal grassy hop.  Flavor follows, a bit thin up front, burnt toast, sweet caramel malt, overly bitter hop presence, herbal and hay like finish.

4 O - This beer is weird mix of a stout and Belgian dark ale. Defiently an interesting sipper for the colder months.

2 Food match: Lighter, creamier cheeses, nothing sharp, might work with this. However donât go wasting a Chimay Grand Classique on this beer.

3 Overall: I like this beer, and this brewery. One of my favorite fall seasonals of this year. I'l drink anything that says Mayflower on the label.

1 Poured a bottle obtained from a Pick 6 craft beer wall into a weizen glass. A nice looking brew, dark reddish bronze with around two inches of light khaki colored foam. Smells like classic grainy wheat spice, cereals with hints of caramel, grassy hop and fruity ale yeast esters. Unless the particular example is well-hopped I find it hard to detect much aroma in this style. On the palate, I get a strong wheat flavor coupled with nuts and delicate brown sugar, along with more vague fruitiness. A tad syrupy yet somehow watery as well, difficult to describe this seeming paradox ... Likely a diacetyl by-product, almost a buttered bread effect going on here. Aggressive carbonation that lifts up the wheat husk and spice. Someone below compared this favorably to Grasshopper and I echo that sentiment. A decent showcase for rather unadulterated lightly toasted wheat flavor.

2                       O: lots of promises, but in total a sub-par beer
3                                Overall a nice beer. Would drink again.
4

6 O - A nice refreshing beer, a bit thin in body but it has good flavor.

Interesting beer that I'm glad I forgot about, actually, as it makes a great transition towards trying-to-be-spring in the Upper Midwest. I hope they bring this one back next year.
2 Poured this into a weizen glass and boy does it look good. Solid black brown the color of dark chocolate or French toast coffee beans, with a creamy cap of cocoa colored foam. This is a showcase for malt all the way. Aroma has caramel and chocolate notes, along with a light chocolate covered banana note. It's sweet without being cloying. Pleasing chocolate malts and a touch of banana.

6 Very good beer. Lots of chocolate and coffee. The wheat mixes well with the coffee flavors. This beer features more coffee bitterness than sweet chocolate, but both are there.

4 Pours to a deep reddish-brown.  Head is off-white and dissipates quickly, leaving light lacing.  The aroma is a little corny, but otherwise decent.  Mild flavors.  The dark grain flavors really overpower any wheat taste you might get.  Usually wheat has a sweet, spicy flavor, but this drinks more like Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter than a wheat ale.  The carbonation is almost perfect, while the flavors hit the palette rather mildly.  This is better than I was expecting.  The price wasn't too bad either, build your own 6-pack for $7.99

2 Taste starts out with a very artificial chocolate flavor, sweetness throughout with a hint of vanilla, fizzy carbonation makes it seems like a chocolate cola than a a beer

Not brilliant, but multifaceted and interesting.
2 Has been an ok beer in the past if well short of spectacular. Brown in colour with a faint ruby hue. Nose is not really inspiring; faint roast and minerals. Very amber ale-like to taste; milky chocolate (mild) and maybe the faintest hint of roast. Underpinned with a slightly cloying sweet note which is not attractive. Iâve had better bottles.

It left me feeling quite underwhelmed, and not very excited.

As it warms the wheat beer characteristics become more noticeable, increasing complexity.

2 Medium bodied, reasonably smooth and with a solid warming aspect. Effervescence is restrained. It drinks like an Imperial wheat - which I've never heard of - and in that mindset this is a really good beer. As a standard wheat, it's ok. Either way, the nose is a bit off so don't take a deep whiff before you sip and it'll be good.

5 Night cap. Poured into a tulip. Everything I remembered from the first time I had this one. Great double IPA, as to be expected from Founders. Three more waiting for me in the fridge.

6 Pine and honey, accompanied by a subtle metallic hint, resulting from the carbonation, interact incredible well with the tongue numbing citrus bitterness, tranforming the taste more and more into a tropical fruit direction, due to the distinct, honeyed malts infusion. This beer is truly abrasive, while it highlights all the positive characteristics of a well composed IIPA. Its versatile in taste, while it provides a merciless bitterness, wrapped up by citraic fruits and honeyed malts.

1 Overall I think the age on this particular bottle robbed it of some of its merits. It just wasn't as intense as it presents itself to be, though I can tell the potential is there. Would like to try a fresher release in the future.

3 Pours a medium copper amber with medium white head. Smell is very unusual in that it has a grape aroma mixed in a hop forward nose. Reminds me more of a barleywine nose. Sweeter scent mixed in the nose that I can't put my finger on, almost a licorice candy, with slight sweet bread note. Taste has a distinct malt presence that reminds me of malted milk ball. Unusual for a DIPA to be so malt heavy with little hop bitterness to the palate. It's difficult to sort out the different flavors as a result. This is one I need to come back to when it comes out fresh.

1 Not a bad beer. Definitely not a go-to IIPA for me, but probably the best offering from NB I've had yet. It's plenty hoppy enough for most, with a decent amount of flavor. It's lacking body, though. Again, not a bad beer. Just slightly off, in my opinion.

6 I wish there was a bottled on date... IPAs should be fresh to fully enjoy. Certainly a malty nose with hints of orange candy and pineapple. Taste is very balanced with sweet malts and sticky resinous pine (also a hint of sweet juice). A bit of booze in the finish but the 10% is well hidden. Complex and quite enjoyable - let it warm a bit!

4 Very hopped up beer.  You get the hop aromas right off the pour.  The smell is amazing.  The taste is nice and strong you can pick up that 8.2% ABV.  The hops in this beer are nice and citrusy and give a lot of pine notes.  I liked the beer a lot and would suggest trying it.

2 Overall: I think that this is a great beer for any time of the year. I like that it has a higher ABV so that you can unload after a long hard day and at the end of the first beer you are already having a mild buzz. I think that the IBUs are not excessive as they are balanced by a malty body that makes for a very drinkable beer. Drink it nice and cold and be sure to pour it instead of drinking it out of the bottle.

Pretty standard but very excellent.

If you like dank BIG ales, this is an awesome beer.  Lagunitas is a great brewery and this is one of their finest.

1       Purchased a 5 day old 4 pack of 12 oz bottles. Thoroughly enjoyed!
2 O: Big bitterness balances big malt to produce a wonderful evening brew.

1 Pours a cloudy golden color with 2-3 fingers cloudy head with decent retention and leaving curtains of lace. The nose features hops hops hops with big floral and citrus (grapefruit, orange) notes, very dank and some toasted malts in the there also.  On the palate, again massive hops, floral, pine and citrus, dank and coating, some residual malt sweetness for balance.  It has a medium body, smooth and refreshing with lots carbonation.  Just a fantastic IIPA and dangerously drinkable!

3 Overall, another impressive beer by the boys from Munster. This one is almost as good as Cimmerian sabertooth Berzerker, which I gave a 5. It all comes down to personal taste, of course, but this one was just a little too muted for me to consider it worthy of a 5. Still an awesome, awesome, awesome beer. I enjoyed every sip.

5 Overall this is a very good double IPA. As I mentioned before, I would compare it to something like Sixpoint's Hi-Res. The price point near my house ($15.49/4-pack) makes this a few and far between type of beer, but if I saw it at a restaurant, I would certainly order it.

2 Great smell and look. Initial taste is pretty hoppy with a small bite. Great beer overall. Also, canned feb 2 2015 so not that fresh. But still good

1                    Single best nose ever for me. Worthy of all the Hype. Had it fresh side by side with Zombie Dust - different style but still a top 10 beer for me, and Heady killed it. Just super impressive.
2                                                                                                                                                             An amazing double ipa can't get much better than this

4                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5                                                                                                                                                    Overall: Good but I would put some other DIPAs ahead of Heady.
6 After all the hype, I expected more....too much?  Pretty much like drinking grapefruit juice.  I also question the instructions to drink from the can, a good beer should be able to be appreciated from a glass.

Super west coast IPA, could drink it all the time but incredibly it was my 4th Favorite beer of the day! Just a great beer, just not as good as Nelson or Duet...
3 Another good beer from Alpine. Pours radiant copper, semi-transparent, a finger of foam and decent retention. I'm getting a lot of fresh-cut grass and pine needles in the nose. A bit of grapefruit that feels like it was sprinkled with my grandpa's sugar. The taste is pretty much the same with piney notes taking center stage. I get a big wave of grapefruit on the finish, intermingled with a touch of lemon. Ample doses of bitterness, which is always good. Finishes a bit dry, and leaves that tongue smacking effect I enjoy so much. Glad to have tried this one. Don't pass if you get the hopportunity. Larrrrrrrge.

1 Poured into a tulip glass, this beer had a nice thick white head and a mango orange color. There where copious amounts of floaties probably from the whole cone hop additions, and quite a bit of haze. It smelled of citrus, earth, and hops. It had a full mouthfeel with citrus bitter, earth and grass notes. Nice dry piney aftertaste.

Enjoyed the woodsy smell but expected/wanted more hops. Felt a bit watery for a double. Would buy again if at a better price.

4 I've been on a IPA kick lately and this is my favorite. It use to be hard to find but I guess it's gaining popularity.  Hope it sticks around.

6 Overall: Expected more bursting flavors coming from a beer with an 8.2% ABV.  However, it is very easy to drink and I would recommend it as a casual summer IPA

1 Deep amber in color with a murky appearance.  There's a good inch of densely packed beige head resting on top.  Heavy lacing is on my glass.  Aroma of citrus hops and cereal grains is prominent.  The flavor is a deep citrus burn comparable to an orange that is held in check by some light cereal grains.  On the fade you get a nice citrus hop burn.  The mouth is fairly thick,creamy, and a bit chalky.

3 Beautiful golden color with a little less than an inch of foam.  Tastes and smells citrusy and mildly hoppy.  Goes down easy.  A solid IPA from one of my favorite breweries.

2 Poured from tap into 10oz flute. Pleasant and mild aroma consisting mostly of hops and grass (maybe more floral than grassy) but I could pick up whiffs of citrus (orange mostly), and mild, buttery caramel. It pours sparkling golden-orange with nice finger-width, slightly off-white, head consisting of evenly sized small bubbles. This pour had the benefit of a glass which must?ve had etching on the bottom - there was a constant stream of carbonation feeding the head, giving it a presence throughout the drink (the flute has an etching on the bottom), and leaving a nice lacing around the glass by the end. Even in a plastic glass, the head retention is generous, creamy, and fluffy and has a lot of sheet lace. The taste is a balanced medium high, citrus bittersweet. It?s a nice, medium body, a bit sticky with a mild hop flavor lingering. The constant head gives it the benefit of being creamy and frothy throughout, but it doesn?t feel fizzy at all. Itâs a medium body, a bit sticky, thatâs creamy and thick but also smooth with flavors of bread toast, biscuit, and caramel with some citrus. There?s a reason Dogfish Head gets so much credit for their beers, and this is a shining example of how to make and Imperial IPA without over-doing any aspect of it.

I can not keep my mouth shut about how much I enjoyed this beer.

Sadly ended up drain pouring it. It was not what I excepted it to be at all.

I waited one year for tasting this and it didn't disappoint!!
5 Bottled 2/17/14. Deep amber and sediment laden with off white pour. Licorice and alcohol fumes with caramel - spicy fruit as it warms. First sip tastes like cotton candy dissolved in rubbing alcohol. Hot alcohol exhale. Spicy apricot with caramel middle. Hoppy candy finish. Intense heavy alcohol laden mouthfeel. Big flavors, rich sherry like linger - very few beers compete at this level.

2 All in all, loved this beer. Gorgeous aromas of citrus and hops. Very narrow taste of noble hops, no citrus. Nice.

1 Great citrus nose, really well balanced taste. Definitely a winner, especially since I'm drinking a bottle that probably over a month old.

Tap availability only makes it taste that much better, sucks for those who do not get Russian River.

5 Ok, had to find out what the hype was all about.  Waited 90 minutes and was told I was a genius for going on a Tuesday.  The nice thing is, Russian River only allows in as many as can be seated (none of the usual madhouse, quite civilized) and they charge the normal pricing for it (and are proud of it!  Truly a labor of love!).   Background:  I'm not a hoppy guy.  Doppelbocks, stouts, porters, ciders are where I live.  This beer changed all that.  Smooth, amazingly smooth with a hoppy finish at the back / center of the tongue.  Not overpowering at all in taste but packs a punch at 10%.  Very much worth the wait.  Best beer I've ever had?  Yes.   Easily the best IPA.  Got to enjoy seven (10 oz) glasses this year and I'll be back for more next year.

3 If this beer had a vagina I'd definitely have sexual relations with it! I'm seriously considering divorcing the wife and starting a new life with Pliny the Elder.  I want to make babies with this beer and pick out window treatments on a Sunday while the big game is on and you know what I don't care about missing the game because I'm in love! And if you can't respect that then Gtfoh!!

6 Overall, interesting beer! I am not generally a pilsner fan (or lager fan generally), but I enjoyed this beer more than I expected.

2 In a blind taste test, not sure I could tell this apart from an IIPA, but it does have a bit of a hop-to-malt character with little taste in between. More malt-forward as it warms up, but IMO, it's best consumed cold. I feel like this beer was made to get you drunk on a nice, summer evening with no questions asked. 8.7%, but by the bottom of the bottle, you'll swear it was 11%. Good stuff.

2                 Aroma is crisp and malty, not strong, a subtle fruity note. Pours a luscious clear dark amber with a frothy and rather persistent pale buff head. Rich, malty flavor has a fruity undertone, mainly apple plus touches of pear and banana, and a snippet or two of hops. Smooth texture has good body, if not a whole lot of fizz. Leaves a nice malty, fruity, slightly hoppy finish. For a malt liquor, danged good!
3 Tastes very hoppy, while not being intensly bitter, with grass and hints of herbs, accompanied by orange and papaya. Malts are well integrated, pushing the taste into a sweeter direction. The malt sweetness then gets damped by a wheaty, dry finish, in which the metallic carbonation shines. The dry finish remains interesting, due to tropical fruits, playing a convincing counterpart to the typical pils-like lager finish.

2 10% imperial pale lager that pours a slightly hazed orange gold color.  The aroma is of fresh citrus zest, green tea, apricot and honey.  The flavor has more of the intense orange citrus note, substantial bready malt, but bitter.  Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% imperial pils, but it's still there.  Hop flavor is plentiful with semi tropical notes and some herbal elements.  Full bodied, carbonated lager that is damn smooth.  Another winner from Mikkeller, solid hoppy strong lager.

6 Very good beer overall. Not a Pale or IPA but close to a Pale Ale. As the name suggests, drinks like a Lager, but at 5.2 ABV, puts you in a good spot. I really wish it wasn't a limited edition, this has grown to be one of my favorites when I'm not in the mood for something heavier.

4 This is a terrific imperial pilsner, and I grab one nearly everytime I see it on the store shelf.

6 O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if youâre in the mood for the style.

5 08/22/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. A great pils. A touch spicier than most. Thoughtful brew. Only caveat is the 7.6% ABV. Session-able taste & body, but treacherous kick. God bless us one & all.

5 On tap at The Bruery, poured into taster. Hazy yellow in appearance with thin white head that settles to a persistent film. Leaves some lacing. Aroma is hop-forward with citrus, floral, and pine. There is a little grain, too. Hops carry the day in taste, too, with a moderate bitterness that is less than expected based on the nose. A thin ribbon of sweet malts is perceptible in the background. Nothing shocking in the palate: medium body, crisp texture, average carbonation, dry bitter finish.

6 I enjoyed this beer a lot - the hops were much stronger than I expected. I enjoyed the subtle, fleeting sweetness in the aftertaste. Pretty dry and bitter finish but it worked very well in my opinion. The smell was pretty thin, but I would prefer this beer over most lagers.

2 Regal Pilsner pours brilliant gold with a  1â frothy, persistent white head that produces excellent lace. . There are no big no hop aromas on the nose to season the rich fresh baked bread aromas. Malty sweetness initiates the palate with a definite lemony citrus hop presence. Excellent lacing. It has medium to medium full body - not quite chewy â and has a smooth, creamy texture. Well balanced, drinkable and repeatable.

4 O - An excellent, unique beer. Perfect as a summer alternative when you want a sipper, but don't want anything too heavy.

1 Something about evil twins strong hoppy beer that is punishingly sweet. I hated the single hop Molotov, and while this isn't quite so diabetic, it's majorly sweet, especially for a wheat lager. Not sure why, but it is. It really takes away from the mosaic hops, which smell a whole lot more alive and awesome than they taste. Goes great with the wheat malt, which is robust in both flavor and texture. Grainy but sort, with. Ice bubbles, if this were drier it would feel amazing. Nice combination of flavors, and well balanced, but so sweet as to be distracting, and not just in the finish but all the way through. Hard to tell its a lager, not much yeast flavor here and no crispness because of the sugar. I had it on tap, but have heard bottles are much better for some reason. Still love evil twin, but this had way more potential. Add Brett and give it a year I bet it would be epic!

4 My first gander into Imperial Pilsners. At 11% this beer should be boozy, but it's not. The mouthfeel is where this beer excels, and it where it wanes is its lack of hop character. Definitely a nice sipper, a little sweet for my current palate, but the lingering honey, orange, and cream soda notes are well executed. I've never tried the original -OBP, so I can't compare it.

4 Hoppy but not overly so. Has a malty sweetness that balances well with the hops.

1 O - A very intense beer, Jack's Abby has renewed my interest in Lagers.  (!!)

6 This is a really excellent effort out of Framingham: a great alchemical operation that brings the best of two burgeoning genres (New Zealand-hopped XPAs and Imperial Pilsners) and holds those qualities in elegantly coordinated concert.

1 Was at the local pub tonight, ordered this on draft. SHWEEET!!! I had no idea what I was ordering, except that I generally like all of Jack's Abbey brews. Holy cow it was good. I have to say I've never seen a beer that looks like this. Pineapple yellow, and murky as f**k. Small white head that leaves decent lacing. Smells of strong, sweet and bitter hops. Wonderful citrusy pineapple favors with sharp evergreen aftertaste. Strong. Good. Will definitely seek this out again.

Huge citrus punch and a bitter pine finish.

4 I like it because it is basically a balanced 'beer' flavor. Plus it has the coolest label I've ever seen.

3                This is a very tasty IPL. I believe the key to enjoying this beer is to allow it to warm. The complexity of the malt truly shines as the temp climbs. It is dangerously quaffable for its high ABV. Another winner from Indeed! I feel like I could drink the entire 4 pack but I need to work in a few hours.
4 I don't really get the imperial lager angle...none of the clean crisp flavors I love in lagers in this one, even though there are plenty of interesting things going on in terms of the flavor profile: honey is quite pronounced, as are some relatively complex floral and orchard notes...fairly heavy and slick mouthful.

6                                                                                                                                                           Kind of a clumsy, lager yeast/honey mash up. It doesn't come together as well as I had hoped. Maybe the pilsner yeast had some trouble finishing this 8.7% monster.

6 I really like Sam Adams Noble Pils and the double version didn't disappoint.  Pours hazy orange with nice white lacing.  Sweet, somewhat sticky.  Green apples, peaches, and citrus emerge.  Finishes with a spicy note.  More similar to a double IPA than a stereotypical pilsner.

2                                                 Mediocre. Too hoppy for a refreshing lager, not hoppy enough for a satisfying IPA.

2 Much too sweet and sticky for a lager even if it is an imperial beer. The color alone was telling of how much malt was laid down in this beer. Rather easy to drink once you dismiss this as a lager.

3 Pours hazy straw under a fine 1â bone white head that slowly dissipates to a thick film that produces good lace. Spicy nose with light grains.  Bread and grainy malt lead the palate to a drying, crisp finish with a touch of tartness. Medium body and medium to medium high carbonation.  Full flavored but well balanced with a pleasant bitter hop accent on the finish.

2 Overall OK, but not really meant to exist. I do love DFH experimenting, and Sam is such an awesome guy, but this one wasn't quite there. The lager yeast was just not meant to make a beer this big.

Rustic, grape smell. Tastes of citrus and hops. Smooth finish. Great overall beer, different than most pilsner's that I've had. Very nice.

4 I have little experience with Pilsners is general, and so I didn't really know what to expect from this beer. I was a little worried it would be too hoppy due to the label saying continuosly hopped. However I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. The hop taste was quite mild, and there was an interesting and unexpected grape flavor to the beer. This beer was good enough that I would consider buying it again.

5 I was expecting a darker beer, but it was definetly interesting.  It came out almost like a Japanese IPA.  Bitterness was there, but nothing compared to what's in the states.  Color is a dark amber, no hint of sweetness, good hoppy taste.

1 I've only had a few IPL offerings and this one is really more of an IPA. No lager finish and way heavy on the alcohol IMO.

3 Tastes of honey and grass.  Heavier and richer than it looks at first.  Enough carbonation to balance it out.

2 Number 2 of the evening. Golden glow, fluffy white cap. The smell is Northern Michigan; I want to marry it. Taste is smooth and silky, a little bite of spruce/hop. Not something to drink a six of, but a nice slow sipper on a hot day

1 After having it on tap I considered seeking asylum in Canada.  So imagine my excitement after bringing the legal allowable limit back into the states to be rationed out until my next possible visit.  Alas once having it on tap, the bottle version was a let down.  While unfair to compare it to the tap version I will forever feel that slight pang of heartache upon the first sip from the bottle ... well of the beer, poured from the bottle.

Strong, pleasant aroma. Bitter coffee aftertaste; could be more refined, but very smooth for a strong stout.

Incredible nose, the sweetness, the coffee, the chocolate. Unbelievable. A great beer to share with non beer geeks - i guarantee you will blow their minds. I have never met anyone that did not love this beer. Not saying it's the best but it's damn close for me.

Overly spicy, slightly stale, missing some body, and not very accessible. Overhyped in my opinion.

3 Bottled in 2010.  Drank it in March, 2015.  Smooth, silky.  Molasses, a slight peppery taste on the way down.  Very little alcohol noticeable despite the 11.7%.  The aging worked wonders on this beer.

Wonderful blend of cocoa and coffee with the delicious body of an oatmeal stout. Founders does not disappoint with the Breakfast Stout.

6 O - Founders proves they are one of the world's masters of dark malty beers. One of the best coffee beers going. So supremely balanced it stymies the senses into blissful chocolate and coffee submission. However, I must say I like Founders' Porter and KBS (duh) better. It's probably a deadheat between this and their Imperial Stout, too. But that is not meant as a slight - this is an awesome beer. A winter without at least one of these is a winter of our discontent, indeed.

3 O:  If you're a fan of brandy-filled dark chocolates, you will probably enjoy this brew quite a bit. Seems like a beverage that would go well with the holidays. Buy one or two in the summer, and hope they age well for the winter.

1 This beer is way overrated IMO. Too boozy with no depth of flavor. Glad I didn't pay $30 for it. It was a gift.

Not available where I typically drink and buy beer, but if I saw it in any liquor store, I'd buy it again. Definitely on par with Founders Breakfast Stout if comparing to a pillar of coffee stout style.

Also, this is the nitro version. Excellent beer. Sweet cocoa flavor with lost of espresso taste. Bought a bottle to take home. My guess is Iâll like the non-nitro version even more.

5 Some medium chocolate & vanilla espresso on the nose, but it has more of a roasted coffee flavor. Not quite as rich or creamy as you might think given the namesake.  You can certainly get fragments of the espresso as well chocolate mocha, but most of it is the roasted coffee, not that it is a bad thing.  It has a smooth feel & finishes pretty easy.

6 Excellent chocolate flavor with hints of the oak aging. Hides the abv well with a nice smooth after taste. Highly recommend.

6 O- Need I say more? Best BBA Stout I've ever had hands down. This thing is a monster, so it may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something to blow you away, this'll do it.

6 2014 bottle poured into a snifter. Inky, black as night with a deep brown quarter inch head. Smell had licorice, molasses, vanilla, chocolate and a hint of cinnamon.  Taste is very layered, and complex. Get waves of baker's and milk chocolate, red licorice, vanilla, brown sugar, and a dry cinnamon and chile finish.  Mouthfeel is substantial and oily. This beer really leaves it's mark.  Overall this is an outstanding beer. I think I might like chile kick of a Prairie Bomb a bit more, but this is a more complex treat.

1 On draft in a Lost Abbey tulip glass. Wouldn't guess that it is 11%. Alcohol very well hidden with the malt
2                         Wow! More stouts should use this as their barometer - perfect as far as I can tell.

3   Read the summary and don't taste the coffee or chocolate hints.  Flavor is still pretty good.  Color is solid dark brown with a tan head.  It sit heavy in the mouth.  You can tell it's high in abv.
4 This is a very smooth Stout, not too overpowering.  The oatmeal flavor definitely stands out and gives this beer a delightful taste.  I highly recommend this beer if you like Stouts or any dark beer.

1 O - Easy drinking beer.  Pleastant sweetness with tons of flavor and not much bitterness.

6 Bomber per Al's Whiskey Lounge in Syracuse, NY. It SMELLS a lot like Ten Fidy, but it tastes much spicier, specifically on the back end. Retains a nice 1cm layer of head. Wowâif you're a stout guy like I am, don't pass up this one.

5 Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Sweet aroma, slight toffee notes. Wonderful taste of slightly sweet coffee, very roasty; finishes with a balanced degree of bitterness. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly thick, a bit grainy, but it's incredibly drinkable for 8+% abv. Fantastic beer, definitely on the sweeter side though.

4 O - 4 - A very good stout, but definitely one to be sipped on quite slowly and on the coldest of days. Could be improved by what I would surmise as, less, if not no use of turbinado sugar.

1 Bam dark chocolate bitterness right away hard. Silky smooth in the mouth, really really pleasant mouth feel. Then the Chilli's come through. Spice. Finish is bitter chocolate with a hint of tongue tingling chili. Wow the chilli. Unique taste but I must confess i don't love it that's on me not Prairie.

Very sweet. Lots of chocolate and vanilla flavor with a mild peppery bite. Up there with the best.

5 He comes in a solid second, with the county local loping gracefully past him: honking like a goose and reminding Uncle of his huge cost.  A year rest surely helped Uncle a great deal, another year for his 2 brothers dozing in the cellar before they try to do battle on the county.  They may try to race on Black Tuesday, but lack the legs and lungs. Rather than compete, they mare retire to the realm of liqueur and leave beer world forever.

Awesome beer. Canât even tell this beer is 16% ABV. Smooth bourbon flavors meld well with the chocolate malt flavor of the beer. Had to buy a bottle to take home.

2 This on draft is so much better than bottles. It has an alcohol punch at the end that detracts a bit from the richness of the stout. But when I want a stout this is the one I drink.  @11% it gets the job done quickly. Another barrel aged brew I tend to lean towards.

At 10% it should be expected I suppose.  Flavor was good otherwise but the finish was hot and felt out of balance to me
6 This was strong in nearly every sense of the world and even though this booze wasn't a detraction here, a bit less of it and some more flavor would have made this outstanding. It reminded me  too much of the Southern Tier Choklat with a bit of the Oat thrown in for good measure. In a style crowded with a lot of big names, this one fell short because of this overlap but if you're looking for a dessert in a bottle, this would be a good a choice as nearly any!

1 Bomber from Sadie for my birthday.  Sat in the fridge for six months before I drank it.  It was very mellow and smooth...I wonder if the cellaring of this smoothed it out...I'll need to try a fresh one next year to see the difference.

A very reliable stout at my favorite spot. Thin, off white head in a 16 oz Tulip glass. Heavy toasty flavor with a sharp finish. My go to stout.
5 O: monstrous disappointment for me, possibly a bad bottle, but at the price I will not try again.  The label touts balance, carbonation and pair-ability  with food and it really offers none of this.   There are far too many other stouts that out perform this.  I'm stunned at the high ratings really, it's good, but certainly not THAT good.

1 12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 11/4/2016. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, pepper, herbal, light smoke/char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, pepper, herbal, light smoke/char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roasted bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, pepper, herbal, light smoke/char, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast and roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian imperial stout. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.

5 Overall, a well done BBA beer. Not the most complex example you'll find, but the bourbon isn't overpowering, which is a trait I particularly enjoy. If you enjoy a BBA beer where bourbon doesn't dominate, give this beer a try!

Big and bold, with a subtle honey sweetness to balance it out, well done

6 Bottle from Joe. Thanks brah. Pitch black pour, small fizzy dark brown head. Huge anise aroma with some coconut, lots of bourbon and woody oak, roast, sweet chocolate, caramel, yum. Flavor follows with lots of bourbon and anise and settles into vanilla and caramel. Roast and chocolate are there, and there's an extra sweet tang that I assume is from the honey. Surprised how well this stands up to the barrels at only 8.5%. Rich body, medium low carbonation. Even better than expected.

4 O: So far this is the best SN beer i've had. It's super refreshing and well balanced between it's hop profile with a nice slightly sweet/malty finish.

5 From bottle to snifter. Yields a finger of light beige sudsy head, with poor retention and lighter lacing walls. Pale and darker orange with some amber. Not overly aromatic, but peppery rye is present immediately, followed by spiciness. Tastes quite piney, with rye lingering for a while after sipping. Some citrus notes, and sweet malted backbone. Feels medium bodied, and slightly slick. Medium/low carbonation and well balanced. Very pleasant beer with a beautiful rye finish. I thoroughly enjoy all SN beers and this is no exception. Will buy again.

Malty aroma and taste. Nice and citrusy too.

5 Hazy pale amber topped by a clingy white cap. Nose is herbal, leafy, citrus rind, touch of grain. Faintly tropical note suggests minimal usage of some new school hop probably mixed with a bunch of oldschool hops. Taste is okay - bitter citrus rind, leafy earthiness, ear wax, grapefruit. Pretty bitter and dry, slight astringent mouthfeel. Clean fermentation. Malt backbone feels somewhat substantial, but it's buried beneath a lot of bitterness. Not a great beer by any means, but nothing particularly bad about it. Can't say I'd want to drink it again.

5 Gold in color with nice lacing. Grapefruity floral aroma hops hit the nose followed by... wait you cant follow up those massive hop aromas. This is a nice summer beer with strong bittering hops that finish subtly with grapefruit.

2 Maybe I got a bad bottle not entirely sure as the date was super hard to read. But to me this tasted like a unbalanced Carmel bready mess. Would like to try again at some point just based on reviews on here but for now one of the worse ipa I have had

6 Honestly this is one of the worst IPA's I've ever had.  Mostly because of the quality control but also because on the West Coast this is what most people try as their 1st ipa.  This is when people decide they don't like IPA's.

5 T: Definitely malt over hops on the palate. This however is not a bad thing. It is a fine brew to pickup at a Walmart where I've seen it to be one of the better craft brews in there selection. If it was between this and sweet water iPa for instance, I'd reach for the Titan.

2 Tasting notes: Light colored, fizzy, thin-bodied. Some currant/gooseberry, peach, green grass, catty flavor notes. Sweet and recalls ginger soda, much like its ESB stablemate. Dry, crisp, moderately bitter finish. An old school American hop flavor but with the volume knob turned way down. I agree that its drinkable but could get cloying and dull rather quickly.

2 Overall a very good IPA.  A light taste for an IPA not too much citrus taste but enough to know what kind of beer.  Not the neat of the IPAs but a simple uncomplicated beer.

6                                                            O - A pleasant, bright IPA, with subtle fruit, and a mild malt backbone.  Not extraordinary, but quite servicable.

1 Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is bursting with grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, grapefruit, pine, tropical fruits, bitter and dry. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good beer.

Sculpin is the darling at the Ballast Point ball, but Big Eye is the underrated hot girl that doesn't get enough press. This beer would be the flagship at 90% of the breweries out there. Well done Ballast Point!
2 As others have said, it's earthier than the Sculpin. It's also slightly drier with a heavier emphasis on the piney hops rather than the citrusy ones. Malts are present but I'd say the hood balance out nicely. Great springtime brew for when you aren't ready for the citrusy, fresh IPA's but still want some of those same crisp qualities. Overall: very nice.

5 Poured into pint glass.  Straw color, with a fluffy white head.  Moderate carbonation. I'm not sure that adding grapefruit improves Sculpin which, in my opinion, was pretty damn good to start with.  The extra citrus boost does give this brew a different character, but if I had a choice I'd stick with just plain Sculpin.

5 Outstanding IPA, I bought it once and then hurried back to the craft beer store in Mexico to get the rest of the stock. ItÂ´s just delicious and smells great, itÂ´s a pineapple citrusy IPA.

6 Hard to beat! Perfect balance, incredible smell and great price.  One of the best IPA's ever to be brewed in the south. Try it! 4.80

4 This beer is bar none the best IPA ever made.....even better from can into glass.  The look, smell, mouth feel, taste, finish, everything is spot on.  Bell's cranked it out of the park with this beer!

5 Stoked to have tried this locally. Attempted and failed at the brewery in San Diego. Small place that has awesome brews.

1                              For the price point and availability this is a more than solid IPA.  Brings a nice balance of bitterness and malt forward flavor.

5 Very good IPA. I have been wanting to try this one and I'm glad I got the chance. Not a citrus flavor. Nice and bitter but well balanced. Very good selection.

I tried this one randomly, my friend didn't like it and poured it out. I proceeded to drink the rest of the 12 pack by myself because beer is beer and beer is good! Now I know that this is just what IPA's taste like so I can't say it was horrible, it was actually one of the better tasting IPA's I've had, but I wouldn't buy it again. I drank the whole 12 pack so that says something.

5 DATE TASTED: April 5, 2015... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: second beer rating of Easter--another IPA... APPEARANCE: fresh, thick and foamy white head sits top a rather translucent body; head settles uniformly, leaving an attractive, even lacing... AROMA: grapefruit, yes--and the Simcoe provides unique flexing of hop muscle; the five hops work in unison to create an alluring swirl of pine and citrus smells... PALATE: a palpable, reasonable IPA with appropriate medium body and resinous aftertaste; thick and lively... TASTE: a smooth, mellow mix of hops mesh well with bready malts that suggest a metallic presence; still maintains the East Coast malt base that makes Sam Adams a bit different in the pale ale space...OVERALL: the floral/citric intensity makes this beer a treat; each sip provides a crunch, a bouquet, a blast of competing hops unlike any previous Sam Adams offering...

4 Wow, One of the best IPAs Iâve ever had. Not sure why Iâve always passed up on this one. Excellent example of what an IPA should be. Deep golden amber pour. Huge floral aroma. Very flowery beer. Sharp resin bitter taste, followed by hints of floral notes and strong fruity citrus notes.

6 Light copper in color.  Decent hoppiness on the nose but no real essence of rye is present.  The rye notes comes through in the flavor profile, however, and the hoppiness takes a back seat.  A pleasant fruity notes pokes through on the finish to nicely accompany the hop bitterness.

5 The second IPA I have had from Deschutes, and it definitely lives up to the expectations I had. It pours a cloudy, dark reddish amber color with a big frothy head. The smell has lots of pine, citrus, and some other fruityness i can really pinpoint, theres also quit a bit of malt aromas. The taste reflects this aswell, and has a fairly balanced taste, and it also has what I can only describe as spicy flavor to it. Overall a really tasty somewhat unique beer, I haven't had an IPA that has tasted anything like this one.

1                                                        Delicious. Sweet on the nose but very balanced in taste. Everything blends together quite well with this one. Highly recommended. Very pleasant experience overall.

3 I rather enjoyed the velvety mouthfeel of this one. Other beers should model after this ones feel. Taste is lacking a bit for me tho- not really detecting much citrus which is what I prefer. Bit of a quandary this one.

3 This was an okay beer. I was hoping for more apricot. I'm only a little disappointed, as it was still a decent beer, but as I said above, I won't be getting again.

1 EDIT:  On a plus note, if you know someone who wants an introduction to IPA's this would probably be OK.  I tend to give 2's only to beers I don't want to buy again -- doesn't mean it was bad, just I thought it was far off from good.

3 Pours a bright copper color with an ample two finger head of fine bubbles that fall quickly to leave a thin layer on top of the liquid.  The aroma is a bit subdued for an IPA as I only get some light citrus and floral character with a touch of sweet caramel.  The taste too is a bit below what I'd expect.  While there is a malty base of caramels and biscuit the hop presence is a bit light.  There is a good deal of bitterness but it comes without much in the way of hop flavor other than some floral tones.  This has a nice dose of tingly bitterness which combines nicely with a good dose of carbonation.  The body of the beer itself may be a little light however.  Overall its just ok or maybe even a little disappointing given my expectations for this.

4 I like this one slightly better than Pliny the elder. Slightly less bitter.

1 Very solid. Not my favorite IPA but a good choice when it's available. Not a citrusy taste but plenty of bitter flavor.

5               This was delicious.  Honestly not over-the-top hoppy.  Very refreshing.  Will definitely be buying again.

My Brother In Law brought an ice cold 12 pack of these and we just sort of started drinking them.  There is a slight metallic or artificial taste that sort of hinders the apple-y-ness of this beer (Is it really beer?) but... on the plus side, they go down pretty fast & after a two or three of them in the morning, who cares?
3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   However, after giving it our hardest and deciding to dump it down our semi-clogged drain, the drain is no longer clogged! I suppose it does have some use after all.
4 Found this in my local store's bargain cart (no bins, only carts...yes, shopping carts), so I figured I'd give it a shot for the hell of it.  It pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty-white foam.  The nose comprises bushels of apples: some of them seemingly artificial, some seemingly genuine; some sweet, some sour-leaning.  Cider style, baby.  The taste brings in more of the same, a hint of booze occasionally making itself evident.  There's a bit of corn syrup foundation-ing the situation as well, if you catch my drift.  The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slick feel.  Overall, not a bad vehicle for booze delivery, really; thoroughly reminiscent of a thicker-than-usual cider and totally drinkable.

1                I only drank this as part of a dare and when I had no money.
2                                             An outlier at 1?? Laughable man

1                                                              Very light in color definitely cheap by its taste but not as bad as some other malts that I've had. Very good if you want something cheap to take on a fishing or camping for the week end but is also not bad for the price
2 Not as bad as I thought going in. No reall offensiveness and the booze is hidden, it doesn't taste like much at all, but that gets boring real quick. I can see why people buy these i wonder if the others will have more flavor for better or worse, can't be as bad as stone 11/11/11.

It tastes as sweet as you would expect from an 8% malt liquor that costs under a dollar for a tall boy.  Really atrocious.  That being said, if you are going to buy something like this, it is better than steel reserve or hurricanes.

You're better off going with this, and that's all I have to say... about that.
6 Pours a golden yellow in color with a very thin white cap layer. Some very light spotty lacing was seen but not a lot. The aroma is mostly of sweet corn and alcohol for the most part. The taste is pretty much the same with the sweet corn right up front with lots of alcohol taste. Hard to drink actually. Have to drink this one very cold and probably fast but it still isn't good. Guess if you want a fast cheap buzz then this is your brew. Not a fan. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Had to pour about half of my half out after several sips.

Sucks I can't get it local, it'd be a regular easily.
5 This Ice Malt Liquor is definitely a sipper. It makes my lips tingle and is hard on the throat. After every few swigs from a frost glass I need a sip of water to continue. Sometimes it makes me gag and I spit up a little. I prefer Hefenreffer and O.E. but with the ass kicking 8.2% it does have it's place. To get wrecked! Though it's very soothing and calming in the end...

2 Its a shame most of the reviewers on this site don't understand high gravity american malt liquors, and therefore ignorantly feel inclined to stigmatize and trash them, comparing them with unrelated trendy craft beers. I ask the beer advocate community: please grow up. This is one of the best malt liquors on the market, and I've tried them all, it does everything its supposed to, and does it exceptionally well. A rational beer reviewer would put  well made strong american malt liquors in a similar category as Belgium trippels or German helles bocks: light body, light color, low IBU, delightfully strong, and chuggable! Surprisingly, V.S.L. is smoother than many expensive Belgium trippels, easier drinking than eisbocks, has no off flavors, not overly sweet or boozy, and theres no cheap beer headache hours after drinking. The body is light and crisp, the taste clean, in contrast to the often overly sweet, ester flawed, heavy bodies of many craft beer attempts at strong lagers or bocks. If you go in with preconceived notions this beer is cheap getto trash, based on the bandwagon of close minded novice  snobbery reviews, reconsider. This beer is an archetypical american classic. It doesnt matter if its low price, industrial, comes in a big garish can, or full of corn adjunct - it works, the balance is impeccable. I'll take this masterpiece any time over the endless boring heaps of over-priced over-rated craft hop bomb clones. If only craft brewers would embrace this remarkable beer style and give the hop bombs a rest already.

I poured it into a nonic pint glass and I think it tastes better out of the can. I have to say I like the old Schlitz ML Bull from the 1970's but all I can find lately are these HG Malt Liquors.

6 O - Overall, It was very average for a malt liquor of this strenght. I'd have again if with I were with my friend's ( remember, I am in fact only 23 so I go to quite a bit of college parties ) No true complains. It's $1.19 for a 24 ouncer. No it isn't a craft beer, But if I'm heading up to EMU, WMU, MSU or U of M anytime soon you're damn right I'll be picking some of these up

This brew gets a bad rep in my opinion
5 I just saw this in the store today, came home read reviews here, wnet back and bought a 12 pack, it's the 6%abv version(I was hoping for 8%)  I gave it a 4 on looks simple because I like darker colored beers. A 4 on smell because it didn't smell like corn to me. It gets a 5 for taste I really like the taste, my first impression was a fruity flavor, then it went to a malty taste, I did not find it bitter at all but thats because I drink Irish beer regularly, it did not remind me of malt liquor at all. I gave it a 2 for feel it was very watery to me, over all I rate it a 4 because of the color. The lady at the package store told me that stuff is evil! lmao! Will I buy this again yes I will, It taste very good with a bowl of chili, they paired up wonderfully! I have a strong feeling this should be used in moderation, I have a hunch a night of hitting this heavey will kick yer ass the next day, just saying!

If you already like better ales, give it a shot.

6 Gaaah! While the booze doesn't really cause any problems here, it's about the only thing that doesn't (double negatives for the win!). Minhas' inbred, insidious, and apparently thorough industrial effluent house character in on full display here, for, well, for worse only, I don't think I really gotta say. This is the brewer's best-suited 'style', and yet, this offering is nothing less than a fucking hurtful (hey - truth in advertising!) mess.

2 Oddly of the 5 people who tried it we all had the same opinion it gives you instant heart burn. It is very hard to finish even one because its extreme sweetness. We tried to chase it and mix it but we found the only thing it tastes good with is orange juice. I gave it away to a neighbor who loves those rita's and she said it was bad I would never buy it again nor try the other flavors because of how bad it was

It's okay for what it is. It is awfully sweet though.

3 Tastes more like that pre mixed soda syrup than alcohol.  Neon orange with absolutely no head at all. Smell matches the taste. Very syrupy and sticky in the mouth. Will need to brush teeth as soon as you finish to get the feeling out of your mouth.

2 I suppose once they lowered the ABV to normal-ish adult beverage levels, the fruity malt liquor associations kind of drop off.  Anyways, still not really a beer, the raspberry component completely obliterating any Bud Light [sic] graininess.  More evidence that 'Bud Light' is more brand name than actual beer.

Could go really well with a desert such as a cheesecake. Not too sure how to rate this one though since it is not really a beer

I couldn't take it.

6 Overall I'd say go with any of the other flavors in the product line, unless the idea of a cheap high gravity macro apple cider appeals to you.

2 Ok let's face it. Malt liquor is not a good nor classy beer but we all remember high school. I gave this ghetto/white trash beer a high review for exactly what it is in its own league. Fuckin awesome. Looks like piss kinda smells like it with notes of dank malts grains and crackers. Taste is about the same without as much of that malt liquor funk like steel reserve which in positive is the worse thing in planet earth other than shiner Holliday chear. Come on people if you got $1.39 to spare get rocked by the hurricane

1 Loook for all u hating and underrating this beer, just be honest and grow sum balls and call it wat it is.....bottom of da barrel brew...its a cheap beer with a pretty good amount of alcohol by volume. ..this is basicly a perfect sample of bang for ur buck.. now I could waste everybodys time and compare it like other beers but but dats not da case....

Not good for much else.

4 This is not good beer. Not at all. But its not terrible either. Well, yeah its kind of terrible. But it goes down easy. There are some decent fruity flavors there. And its cheap. So if you want some inexpensive beer, with a kick(8% abv), this is for you. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.
5                                                                                                                                                    This beer is quite drinkable and even at a mere 6 percent ABV could be dangerous.  I think I've discovered my new favorite ultra-cheap beer!
6  Overall, I live in a college town and the street are littered with these each and every Friday and Saturday night, so they must be doing something right. And at least they're cans rather than glass. I'll pass, but I'll also say that it's far from the worst malt liquor I've ever tasted.

Once the 8% numbs my tongue it becomes rather easy to drink. It is an exemplary example of an underappreciated style.

6 A little too sweet, good price for the quality. Anything is better than Bud or Coors, right? The aroma isn't bad. The name is catchy and reminiscent of upstate New York. I usually drink lager or ale warm, but this was ice cold. No way can I drink more than 4 oz. Just a bit too flavorful and I might gain weight. Italians make their beer and wines too sweet.

4 My bottle of Hayward's 5000 was overly sweet with hints honey and bananas leading the way and lingering. The head was small and white with a foamy appearance and the body was clear and gold. It felt syrupy with a small amount of soft carbonation.

2 Again: it doesn't rank up with the greatest beers, but self-described malt liquors rarely do (shout-out to Three Floyds' Region Riot).  This is imminently drinkable, however, which is more than can be said for Naty Ice or, say, Steel Reserve.

2 M/O- The rubber hit the road and it's an awfully bumpy road!  Outside of the better than expected look, this is everything I expected and less!  Thin bodied, palate scrubbing carbonation and unpleasant flavors have led me to decide that this belongs in the reject pile!  I'm sure the good people of the Philippines know full well that this is pure swill.......good for the party crowd I'm sure!

When I think 'Malt Liquor', I definitely think Mickey's, Old English, etc.. this isn't a gross farty beer - it's a smooth, malty, lager.  So while the categorization may be debated, it's quite enjoyable.

1 I feel bad giving this brew such a poor review.  I can vaguely  recall having some great times with XXX, when I wasyounger. This was the holy grail, XXX was the ultimate party beer.

4 Worst Malt Liqour i've ever tasted and i drink alot of malt liqours. Not very fizzy and the taste is reminiscent of pure failure. I keep re-trying to buy this and give it more chances and have only been able to finish it once. Not recommended. Better to pound 2 40 oz Colt 45's than this.

5 You don't get a colt 45 for the taste. But as far as I'm concerned it's not that bad. Good way to get drunk fast and cheap.

5 I began with two fingers of fizzy french vanilla-colored head that hung in pretty well in the face of the humidity that is helping to keep me up tonight. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and suddenly Croesus and King Midas were back to their fighting. Knock it off! This is not worthy of your efforts! Nose smelled like a Minhas product and I do not mean that in a good way. Plastics, pink bubble gum, dry cleaning fluid were all perceived. Could it get any worse? Yes! The taste was burnt rubber and a metallic tang that made me wonder from what kind of glass the bottle was made. Whew! Finish was bone-dry and I was afraid to breathe near any open flames. Phew! I will NOT be allowing this to warm up. It might self-combust. M'man, Snoop Lion says that his jawnt Works Every Time and I would be willing to bet that this gem will work equally well. The best example of a really poor style. Do I now taste eau de cigarette ashtray? I knew I did not want this warming!

More of the same in the taste. Pretty light body considering the abv. Fairly straight forward malt little with a bit of a funk to it. Not looking to drink this again

3 Thanks Colt 45 for taking me back down memory lane (sort of). You aren't half bad, but you got a long way to go, son...

4 Wow, a blast from my teenage years in Florida.  I bought this on the wrong side of the tracks at a gas station in southern Virginia.  When I cracked this quart bottle the first thing I noticed was the skunky aroma.  the flavor was traditional ghetto malt liquor.  which I grew up on.  with that said, the brew was ok, but lacked carbonation to match the flavor.  not completely horrible; but you get what you expected with this beer.  A cheap buzz with little complexity.

It's not a cloying malt bomb like Mickeys

2 Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a medium size white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of light cereal notes is pretty bland. Taste is also dominated by light cereal notes with adjunct barely noticeable. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing really special about that one and I canât say I would have notice this was malt liquor if it had been a blind tasting.

4 It's a cheap Malt Liquor, pretty much just a session beer. Tastes exactly like the price would lead you to assume. This is more of an I want to get drunk kind of beer than a fancy, tasty beer, but at 99 cents for a 24 ounce can, can you really argue with it?

3 I've tasted a lot of beers in my time, but this has to be among the worst.  I know some people mentioning a head, but it had very little for me.  The smell was okay, but the taste was like pure alcohol with a hint of apple to it.  If there were any hops in it, they must have floated to the top and been scraped off because I could taste none.  The ONLY reason I gave it more than a 1.0 is because you could easily hold your breath and guzzle the stuff down---little carbonation or aftertaste.  Skip it!

1 At $1.39 for a 24-ounce can with 10.6% alc/vol, I knew off the top of my head this will probably be a bad experience. I was right. For $1 and change, you're  getting the equivalent of about 4 standard abv beers. Since I don't like anything to go to waste, I will continue drinking (slowly but surely) the rest. It tastes like a carbonated watered-down cheap whiskey to me. If you are a broke college student wanting to get drunk on a budget, this is seriously a steal. I'd actually prefer Icehouse beer over the Camo as far as taste, and I don't even like Icehouse. You get what you pay for.

It has the ability to surprise, being a dryer malt liquor than others, but it doesn't take long to realize you're practically drinking ethenol-flavored beer.

Still if you buy a can of this you know it will not be BCS.

The taste is just pain awful. I got the whole 24 oz can down. I will not get this brew again. Even if it is cheap. Rot gut and death in a can. The color is a dark Amber/Yellow color. Smell of alcohol and cheap brew.

3 Nice slightly hazy golden color with a finger of foam that dissipates into very strong lacing on the glass. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, and pine. Taste is strong with pine and biscuity malts. Very strong up front, especially for such a low ABV, but finishes relatively clean and crisp. Mouth feel is  medium to high carbonation. Overall a lot more than I expected judging from its 76 BA score. Well worth picking up. Enjoyable.

4  so the citrus hop aroma and crisp flavor can stand tall.

Brilliant copper gold under a 1" white foam collar that clings to the side of the glass. Floral citrus nose with traces of fruit. Sweet malt and light fruit on the palate give way to a balancing citrus rind bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. A bold, easy to drink pale ale.

Light brown/Amber with a 1/2 inch creamy head that stayed until draft was half gone. Light hoppy nose.  Tasted as expected light malt...light hop...slightly bitter... The nitrogenized draft made for a pleasant creamy mouthfeel...some would call it flat, but again just how I expected it to be......I had two!
6 Pours an enticing golden copper with a nice foam head; good lace retention throughout. A fruity aroma hits you as well as a malt backbone and some floral esters that develop as it warms. Spicy, herbal, and bold piney hops taste as well as a slight lemon finish. Good pale malt backbone; I nevertheless would have liked some of the fruity elements of the aroma to match the taste a tad more. Medium light bodied, prickly carbonation and very drinkable; definetely a session brew. I  liked it a lot and will get again for sure.

3 Pours an orangish amber color with off-white head. Light pine, citrus, and some malt on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a nice balance between the resinous hop flavors and the malts.

3 3/22...pours copper amber, mostly clear, some white foam. Light caramel sweet nose, malty. Taste is a thin open, light body,  modest hop, fast close. Smooth. A little chewy, fruity like an english pale would be. Simple but enough of a flavor profile to stay interested.

4 O: [3.75] Really nice beer.  This was my first Hill Farmstead beer.  Maybe I was expecting unicorns with rainbows shooting out of them.  But this didn't totally blow me away.  This was a solid beer but did not overwhelm me.
5                                                                                                                                                                    Amazingly flavorful for the ABV. Sessionable and satisfying.

5 I had high expectations opening up a can of this stuff. It was recommended to me, because I wanted to try a new  pale ale. It's very boring and leaves a strange taste in your mouth. With that said, I would still drink it over alot of other shit

1 O - Overall a decent Pale Ale.  Not the best I've ever had but not anywhere close to the worst either.  I could easily down 1 or 2 of these with dinner.  3.75/5

Strong hops aroma as well as floral esters. A strong malt backbone with quite the hops kick in the finish. Smooth and creamy feel, very drinkable. I could see it as a session beer.

Smells citrusy at first - orange and grapefruit - giving way to more pungent floral aromas, leafy herbs, and raw grain.  Flavor is pretty much standard, classic APA: floral/citrus Cascade hop bitterness, light resin, and a clean malty sweetness underneath.  Medium bodied, finishing clean and dry.  Nothing memorable, but it doesn't really do anything wrong either.  Good,straightforward APA.

5 A rather nice looking beer... The big soapy near white head makes this look delectable. Lace is spotty. The beer is a nice shade of golden amber, and once the head calms down a quarter inch layer hangs on. Aroma is lightly sweet with a nice crisp and semi juicy hop aroma over a bed of grainy malt. Dank tropical fruit mixed with zesty citrus, and some grassy floral. Taste is dry and briskly hopped with doughy, slightly caramel maltiness. The hop bitterness is evenly dispersed throughout and lingers on for awhile after the finish. Good well balanced beer with a slightly forward hop presence. Very likable and also sessionable. Good stuff!

3 Nice hoppy beer that is only slightly bitter. I can see why some call it a session pale ale. Nice grapefruit smell/taste. Clean and refreshing throughout. My personal favorite from New Glarus.

3 More sweet malt as a flavour, with a little spicy and piny hops behind.

4 Reddish gold color. The head dissipated quickly. Strong hop flavor. Next complexity.

6 Looking forward to any Great Lakes beer as I am a huge Edmund Fitzgerald fan. But this one left me a little disappointed. Decent flavor, easy drinking but just not the pop I was expecting.  Too average for what I was hoping for, just wanted more flavor and bite.

2                              Great flavor.  A lot lighter than typical RR hoppy beers in a good way.
3                                                                                                     
4 A really excellent APA. I think this deserves consideration alongside the best APAs in the business.

3 Billed as a Helles lager, it lacks the malt sweetness found in some of the better versions of the style.  When speaking with Cricket Hill Founder, Rick Reed, he mentioned the East Coast Lager is pretty much all he drinks at the brewery.  It is easy drinking and crisp, so I can see why.

6 Not bad. Just didn't leave me wanting another. Seemed a bit thin. Glad I got to try it though

5 Solid pale lager.  Nothing too remarkable or unusual, but very tasty and one of their better beers.

2 Kenzinger, a nice beer when your having more than 10. Phila. Brewing Co. has a wide variety of beer. And if you stop in make your own case for only 27$$. From unfiltered Walt Wit to Newbold IPA to Kenzinger lager, something for all.

6 O: Upslope Craft Lager was a solid pale lager, probably more in the pre-prohibition lager mode than a helles or pilsner given the evenness of the malting and hopping. Nice job and I look forward to trying a few more Upslope offerings this trip.

4 Overall, this is a fresh brewery for us.  They certainly advertise this brewing company across Omaha locally enough, but we are kinda happy we got a sampling chance on this visit.  We had just finished âpint nightâ actually at a local beer bar, and were coming back to the hotel to finish out our night in the room.  In passing the snack area of the hotel lobby we came across a beer cooler, and obviously happily selected any local beverages that required rating, including this one.  This, as we expected from the description, was a simple lager.  It had a nice drinking face to it, but the flavor just wasnât there in full force.  To retract, the flavor and nose were there in simplicity, but didnât make you want to drink many more of these.  Perhaps if youâre going after a non-exclusively craft audience then itâs okay, but youâre not going to sway any IPA or stout seekers with this one.  The job is done, and one can move on from there.

2 Anyone rating this beer poorly clearly missed the american lager labeling on the bottle. This is supposed to take like a macro adjunct and I think it's a fantastic take. Puts yuengling to shame.

3                                               No head, a little dark for a pale ale. Nice bit of honey flavor, otherwise fairly plain. Not totally unenjoyable but pretty simple stuff.

6 I'm not sure why it has all the poorer reviews.  Maybe I just got a really fresh batch.  If you like light Pilsners, and you are in Florida, I'd say give it a chance.  Hope you agree.

Tons of head.
5 Classic lager look; bone white, thinish, soapy head. Mildly hazy, maybe chill haze. Glowing sunflower yellow to light. Looks great.  Aroma is a potent punch of hops oil, you can almost taste the hops, the aroma is so strong! Underneath the wall of alpha oils,you can detect pear, honey and grapefruit. The taste is appropriately hoppy for the smell; not  buzzsaw of bitterness, but is a well hopped lager, leaning toawrds an IPL. Pale lager malts are mild and add just enough countering sweetness. Sort of a blandly bitter impression, overall.

4 Wonderful hop aroma, crisp body with a distinct lager finish. Unique take on the expected IPA experience. Obviously - whether or not you like lagers will determine how much you will enjoy the overall taste, especially the end when the malt comes on strongest and lingers after the glass is put down.

Can't wait till JA starts distributing in Rhode Island liquor stores, because this lager will vault to the top of the list for any lager purchases I'll make. Yummy!

4 Grainy and floral aroma. Flavor is grainy and floral, as well, with a bready finish. I burp sulfur. There's also some light fruity character present. Clean finish, but nondescript.

2 Comes out of the can a clear, bright, bubbly solar yellow with a thick and rather persistent snow-white head. Crisp, malty aroma has a sweet and fruity overtone, mainly pear. Flavor is crisp and malty with a grassy hoppy undertone and more than a hint of fruit. Smooth texture has good body and a fine fizz. A satisfying pilsner.

Not much pilsner malt flavor

Not much aroma. Mile malt taste and feel. Meh.

Pours brilliant pale gold with a Â½â pale white head. The palate is a slight caramel, faint honey, a touch of tanginess. Medium light body and medium carbonation. A somewhat insipid session beer.

6 A simple tasty lager.  About what you would expect from a lager named supper club.  The not bad motto, as others have said, is apt.  I will say that I disagree with the reviews that state that one is better off going with a cheaper domestic. This beer is definitely of a higher quality, although I will agree a bit pricey for such a simple offering.

3 I found this lager to be very well done, drank straight from the bottle it was clean, crisp with nice hop and cereal hints. Not heavy whatsoever, a beer i could certainly drink all night.  A great intro to Moosehead Lager, my new favorite beer!  I drank 8 bottles and woke up with no headache whatsover, which tells me that clean, natural ingredients are used by the brewery.

I can't speak for how this normally tastes, but what I had was definitely beer gone bad

This is much sweeter than your average adjunct and that's not good.
3 Notes: I was under the impression that this was a Trader Joe's beer, but perhaps not. Regardless, it's one of the worst beers I've found at Trader Joe's. It's sweetish with no hops, bitterness, or malt flavor... just a thin 'corn' note. It's inexpensive, which is great, but it's not good enough that I wouldn't pay more to get a better 'retro' beer (Genesee Cream Ale is just $12.99 for a 30 pack, which equals .43 a can!).

2 Love the taste and the smaller size . Feels good to hold the fat bottle and the taste is great with steaks or a cookout like hot dogs or hamburgers.

4 Not bad for a pale light lager.  Clean and could go well with island cuisine as it has a bit of an edge and more flavor than a regular light lager.  Interesting brew from a brewery than makes solid, clean beers.

1                                         Interesting lager that is tequila flavoured. Has a hidden 6% ABV due to its sweetness and is better than the common economic lagers you find in the supermarket - the tequila taste is not at all awful.

3 It's yellow and has bubbles. The aroma is funky - there is a hint of tequila in this, I think. The taste is like a bad, flat-ish beer with a half shot of tequila in it. It is as bad as that sounds. The big can was just as bad as the bottle.
4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5                                                                                                                                                                                     Taste is too much lime for my liking, not fresh lime either.
6                                                                                                                                                                              Fanta (orange), not sure is there tequila, but isn't that bad, too.

4 Apparently, they also left out punctuation! I Pop!ped the cap and began a hard pour, which netted me ~ three fingers of foamy, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a crystal-clear Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 - 2). Nose had the honey-like sweetness that I usually associate with Lagers, but this was supposed to be G-F. WTF?!? Mind = blown. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was reminiscent of summers on the farm - honey, hay, mown grass. Clean, light, easy-drinking, this was better than many AALs that I have been exposed to and it is G-F! Holy ... Finish was clean, semi-sweet and unquestionably the best of the lot so far.

4 Similar to what Sierra Nevada tried with their Beer Camp Hoppy Lager and what Pyramid did with their IPL, I guess I crave the malt backing that a normal IPA provides to counter the bitter hops. Lots of grapefruit and citrus but no real malt presence. I think I'll just steer clear of this style- it's not for me.

3 Not bad for the lager category. Only issue is the carbonation. I would like to like more

6 Poured from bottle. Pale gold and clear with fairly good lacing. Aroma is light and fresh, florals and some lemon citrus, also a fairly nice crisp maltiness. Taste starts with some bready malts and light floral hops, crisp lager yeast, and a fairly subdued hoppiness, gets a bit tired near the finish, some stale skunky notes. Mouthfeel is light, lots of carbonation, and overall its some and easily sessionable. A decent IPL that gets a fairly boring quickly but works decently as a session option. Hops are mostly floral, with a bit of a fruity edge, and are decently robust.

1 Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of wheat, oranges. Taste is crisp, wheat, spice, a bit of orange, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a thirst quenching and enjoyable beer.

4 A great wheat ale. Was very impressed by it. Would definitely recommend to any beer drinker.
5                      Incredibly full mouthfeel. What a wheat! Drinkable and round and solid.

2 nice taste...light, with lemon notes...slightly creamy as well!

4 The honey didn't do anything for me. Not as bready and wheaty as I would like but decent taste. An OK beer in a field of a whole bunch of other OK beers.
5                                                           Feel: Very refreshing. Light-medium bodied. Very easy to drink. Perfect beer for spring/summer.

4 Overall:  Decent beer, with some nice flavors.  I wouldnât turn it down if offered, but as there are many, many better summer beers out there, Iâm not getting it again on my own.

3 Pours a hazy gold, producing a somewhat lasting, foamy, white head that leaves slim motes, streaks & wisps of lace. Aroma is sweet wheat, lemony citrus & a hint of grass. Taste is a tug-of-war between wheat, lemon & mineral water prickly carbonation with hint of grain & grass. Tongue numbing mineral/carbonation bite in the finish blocks the flavors which reappear as mineral, wheat & lemon in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with intense carbonation, crisp, very prickly but creamy among the spice bite. This pale wheat ale screams Berliner Weissbier.

4 Light, sweet, and summer-y. Drank out of the can, so not sure about the look.

1 Hard to be more refreshing than that. Who said you cannot add lots of hops to a wheat beer and still feels great? The only sin is its body; it sure could be bolder even being very light.

2 This is the worst belgian-style/witbier-style I've had out of the maybe 5-6 or so that I've tried. Definitely not recommended. Normally I find that I can give cheap beers good ratings, but it's certainly not the case here. I'm surprised others gave better reviews. Perhaps it's related to the batch I had and/or the fact that I had it just several days before it's best-before date.

3 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/3/2014. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

3 The smell is wonderful but otherwise average. Take my review with a grain of salt due to my inexperience. Please excuse my brevity.
4                             This beer is just average for me. I've had better in the style and I've had worse. Still a decent brew.
5                                                                                                                                    
6                                      My favorite wheat beer BY FAR. It is the perfect drink for the summer time with a nice orange.

4 Drank from the bottle. Could tell it was a pale ale from the smell/taste. Didn't realize it was a wheat variant at first, although subconsciously I knew it from the name. A little thinner than I would expect from either a pale ale or a wheat ale. Still, a good, drinkable beer. Wish I could say more, but wasn't really prepared to take notes or inclined to think about it really hard. And then, as I said, straight from the bottle, so not much for looks or aroma. Would like to try again some time so I can update my review.

4 Pours a clear pale gold producing almost 3 fingers of white, foamy, somewhat lasting head that leaves a streaky, webby wash of lace. Aroma is wheat, butter, lemon & orange. Taste is thin lemon, orange, mildly wheat bready, a hint of floral/herbal hops with a tiny bit of pepper & bitterness in the finish. Aftertaste is citric & slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is light bodied with with moderate carbonation, crisp but not clean leaving a phenolic presence on the tongue.

1 A damn near perfect summer/spring beer, crisp clean refreshing and delicious. Tart but not too much so, fading quickly into a wheaty beer without the unpleasant flowery taste of a european wheat beer. Smells kinda fishy though, scent is somewhat unpleasant but not so bad as to ruin or really even significantly harm the beer. a small bit of lemon comes through as well

3 Smells of sweet wheat with some light citrus. They call it an ipa but I only get a subtle piney flavor. Not an ipa.

2                        Phenomenal tasting and very smooth yet refreshing!
3                                              This beer is pretty awesome.
4 Tastes nothing like honey. There's a fruity flavor present. Like peaches.
5         Overall-  Hugely disappointing.  This is a very poorly made brew.

4 Scored some Modern Times stuff up here in NorCal courtesy of K&L Wines. This is easily my favorite among the ones that I've tried. As advertised, very tropical - pineapple, mango, papaya - in smell and taste. Tasty to the last drop. Light, refreshing, supremely quaffable.

2                                      It taste exactly like a more subtle version of White Christmas, I believe it is called, but without leaving your palate extremely dry afterwards. Excellent!
3 4/3/15 (Draft - Finley Dunnes Chicago IL) Light brown, murky appearance, minimal carbonation and head. Minimal aroma and taste, malt and fruit present and balanced. Smooth taste. Standard beer.

5 This was my favorite wheat beer for the longest time. It was also my first. I haven't had it in forever, so my points for it go to nostalgia, but I know I'd still like it if I drank one now.

1                                                   It offers yeasty bread aromas and flavors and a hint of banana. There is nice depth from the wheat but not a lot of spice. Although it does not have an immense amount of flavor, it is very refreshing and drinkable.
2 Basically an average at best wheat beer. Nothing about it really stands out as being outstanding, and that funky taste in it doesn't help. I got this as part of a make your own six pack, glad I got to try it, and more glad I don't have 5 more of the same to drink.

6    I'll give Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) - Southern Tier Brewing Company a 4.25 overall. This will probably will be a new warm weather staple for me.

2 Not my favorite.  Poured flat with very little head, which quickly disappeared. Color was a pale opaque orangish-yellow. No carbonation to speak of. Hint of hops and the slightest touch of lemon. The only thing that I liked about this beer is the fact that I only had one.....

3 In a glass from a bottle pours very pale yellow and cloudy with a nice two finger foam head. A faint piney hop smell and a little more prominent in taste. Called a Hoppy Wheat. Hops are certainly present but not overboard which I was expecting. And that's not a bad thing. Loses some head but never completely. A little lace.  Goes down nice with no bite or lingering aftertaste. Very good and at 5.50% Very Drinkable  Bartender.....I'll have one more.

3 Lots of prickly Brett character in the nose; hay and cracked pepper with a touch of funk. Kind of a one dimensional Brett showcase on the palate as well. Heavy horse blanket, clove, and pepper all but overwhelmed the light pear flavor. I couldn't find any hop or wheat characteristics. The mouthfeel was light and airy while at the same time stinging the tongue in a a good way. I liked this well enough overall, but I'm glad I split this one.

2 Pours a golden-yellow in color with a small white head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is what would be excepted which is of sweet wheat grains for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste with a very light dry finish. Different than other similar brews and close to the 'Goose Island '312 urban Wheat'. Lighter-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew.

3                                                 Definitely will be a great summer beer.

5 Not much of a smell. Drinkable, but not terribly interesting. Probably won't buy again.

2 Hocus Pocus isn't really outstanding, but it's not offensive either. It's worth drinking.

4 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/15/2015. Pours hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white grape, wheat, bread, light clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with solid balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt notes; with decent strength. A bit too fruity/slightly metallic in the nose. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white grape, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spice/wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white, grape, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a solid pale wheat ale style. All around good robustness and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

3                                                         Good but not great, and I would drink it again. Unique name and branding, but nothing really special about this porter.
4 O- A decent porter. It's up my alley but not quite in my wheelhouse- I'd prefer a little more hops note and not quite as smoky. But I'd recommend this to another porter lover.

3 O: Like the balance here, freshness and hopping with the light dry nature of toasted chipotle peppers against a sweetly roasted porter malting that is light in character allowing the chipotle peppers to be better exposed and balanced. Nice lingering peppery spicing lasts awhile, is easy drinking, very enjoyable with a good smoked nature, hopping and balance.

5 The smoke flavor was very overpowering. I just don't see the allure of this beer.  I normally really like darker beers but the overwhelming smoke flavor made this very hard to drink.

1 Taste is a combination of roasty flavors and smoke.  Lots of smoke, maybe a bit too much.  Very slightly tart.

3                                                    -  overall a good beer to pair with bbq and anything smoked

1 Poured into a pint glass. Gives about a one inch head nice and creamy and dense. The taste is as it is named. Vanilla java porter. Like it. Good job to the brewers. I'll have more of this.

4 Thin layer of head. Smells like any porter. Initial taste is of mostly coffee. I could barely taste coconut. I was excited for the coconut but was very let down. Not worth the price

1 Smells like a prairie Bomb. It tastes pretty damn good. Smooth like a porter but the burn of an imperial stout with a hint of vanilla. Only issue is that the carbonation is low

2 Dark tan froth atop a charcoal black brew.  Smells of dark chocolate, charred wood, currant and milk chocolate deep down.  Caramel sweetness up front backed by a slight toastiness, a hint of floral hops and nutty right down the middle.  The aftertaste lingers metallic.  Medium to heavy in body and smooth all the way.  A tasty ride albeit with an annoying bump or two in the road.

6 Too sweet.  Too much vanilla flavoring.   Tastes like a soft drink.  Where's the porter?

4 The sum is better than its parts.  Can't explain how easy this is to drink.  You'd never believe it was a sipper if you didn't read the bottle first.  Could easily pass for a drink for kids.

5 The aftertaste is strong with some more burn, but just a little. You don't need to do any shots if you are drinking this monster. Recommended for a taste or a treat.

4 I really enjoyed this. It wasn't overly hoppy so you get to really enjoy the malty chocolate coffee flavor it has to offer.

Subtle sweet fragrance of chocolate and coffee. Flavor is round and full with an alcohol finish balanced with a bit of sweetness.

Delicious.

4 I am embarrassed to say I had never heard of this beer before and grabbed it only to round out an assembled six pack.  But, wow, what a nice surprise!  I really enjoyed it and find myself agreeing with the BA Score - Outstanding!  The rich flavor was so well balanced, it was gone before I knew it.

6 Just finished the last growler of the bottom of the keg. Wonderfully hoppy aroma and flavor but no bitter aftertaste. the dry hopping really does come through. Reminds me of a delicious black IPA.

2 Easy drinking beer, which got a decent complexity to it, turning out a bit too thin and metallic during the finish. Also the bitterness is a bit too harsh, compared to the weaker implemented sweeter flavors of the beer, initially promising a decent balance. The beers interaction between coffee, bitter chocolate and slightly wooden coconuts is very enjoyable though, while the brew remains recognizable as a Porter.

3 Quite possibly the best thing Sam Adam's has ever made. Sweet, syrupy and thick with heavy hints of maple syrup, meaty smoke, malts, almond, marzipan and touches of coffee and chocolate. Definitely want to drink this one when you're cold.
4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5                       I thought this was a great porter. I appreciate drier more roasted porters with more hops. I can also appreciate a sweeter porter like this one. The maple syrup is easy to detect. This would be a great desert porter.

2 Pours opaque but clear. Very dark brown.Thin head of tan foam that fell quickly but left lace.  Nose is shy but malty and rich.  Caramel and bread crust. Good roast taste, nothing burnt.  Robust, smooth but with a slight edge to it.  Medium mouthfeel, slightly chewy.  Perfect carbonation, light hop bitter for balance and a touch of herbal at the swallow.

6 O â An excellent smoked beer.  Lots of aroma and flavor with a solid base robust/American porter.  Very much in balance, perfect next to a campfire or with some smoky meats.

5 Overall: For the price point it is a decent beer nothing spectacular compared to other coffee porters or stouts, but still not bad really. I enjoyed it fair enough its a shade above average in my opinion.

6 Great visual and herby aroma. Flavor seemed a little off. Somewhat bitter and it had small after taste of celery seed. It's nicely roasted, somewhat bitter but not over powering. The celery/earthy flavor note is somewhat to strong and not very pleasant.

The flavors are robust without being over-sweet or too hoppy.

6 Appearance: Pours bright opaque dark brown under a 1â light tan cap that rises slightly over the rim of the glasss. Smell: Roast and dark sugar aromas. Taste: Starts with balance of dark sugars and mild roast drying on the finish with a slight roast bitterness. Mouthfeel: Mediumn full body, medium low carbonation. Overall: Rich in flavor and very easy to drink.

5 Overall:  This is just an ok porter.  Thereâs too much hops in it which completely overpowers the traditional porter-style flavors of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate and because of that I donât really like it, however, hop heads should like it.

4 Smooth and rich in flavor. Distinct chocolate and roasted nature with a tinge of vanilla undertone. Very good balance in incorporating vanilla without overdoing it

5 This one was ok, not great. The taste was really nice, but it was a little too thin for my taste.

6 Poured a dark brown with a cream colored head. Has the typical warm smell of a porter with notes of caramel. Taste is good, not strong like some porters and goes down easy. Overall very good beer.

2                                 Black beneath a small, bubbly covering leaving some spotty bits of lace on the glass.  Smooth dark cocoa, vanilla, plums, and caramel.  A little more vanilla forward in the flavor, smooth chocolate, soft fruitiness, and dark roasty char. Creamy smooth medium body.  A pleasant, but dry stout.
3 Very dark beer with a modest slightly tan colored head. Aroma is surprisingly smokey/meaty with cocoa and, yes some vanilla. Roasty with slight bitterness. Taste is clean with meat seasonsings...hickory maybe, smoke, pine bitterness, and a little bit of vanilla comes through. Pretty decent. Definitely has smokey overtones.

6 Despite this being related to a Stout, it got as much IPA in it, and I love both sides, because they add up so well together. The long aftertaste rounds it all up, as it is defined by a hoppy bitterness, which goes along with a strong malt backbone, which, again, stand in perfect balance to each other.

3                                                      Unusual.  Coffee flavor overwhelms too much resulting in overly bitter taste.

6 Coffee is the dominant note as advertised. A bit creamy on the nose, and a nice full mouthfeel. Otherwise a run of the mill stout.

3 +1 to those who regard this as the essence of the American stout. I'm searching for beers that I call elemental, that represent ideals from which other beers are concocted as mixtures/compounds. This just may be the elemental American stout, and it's available at fantastic price for the brilliance that you're getting here. It's a near-perfect balance of smooth, creamy, and bold. I salute Sierra Nevada for the continuing great quality of the older staple beers, even as the marketing arm seems to be convinced that appealing to hop-heads is the way to go. And I'd suggest that marketing this stout as their #3 grocery store beer, after Pale Ale and [seasonal hop-heavy beer], instead of another hop-heavy variety, would be beneficial to sales in the long run.

Very easy drinking with some hops flavor noticeable.

5 Smelled like fake chocolate cake, tasted like a watered down milky brown ale (though its considered a stout, it was transparent in my glass). Just not good.

5 Blueberries add a nice subtle touch to the aroma and taste of this stout. Feel is nice as well. Enjoyable . . . Try it.

1 My personal favorite from Atwater.  Very silky smooth feel because of the low carbonation.  Sweet dark chocolate aromas make the mouth water!  Great taste from start to finish.  Your typical sweet, not bitter, dark chocolate taste turns almost into a root beer-ish middle, and finishes smooth with more cocoa tastes.  Wonderful beer from a wonderful town.

3 O â Fantastic coffee beer. I only drink my coffee dark roasted and black, this hits all the right notes, no sweetness, just great notes of bitter coffee and chocolates, just great. Though I can see how some might be put off if they are expecting something sweeter.

3 small head. dissipates very quickly. Not as deep black as I like when observing the stout in the glass. Smells unbelievable. Like a roast/coffeehouse. The aroma really is all there Taste is upfront stouty but really unoffensive. If youre ia stout head then this is very mild brew but still very flavorful and enjoyable. Very smooth and grainy. I really enjoy Hopworks and this stout was certainly no dissapointment.

2 Very rich coffee and spicy rye flavor, deep roast, creamy body in a relatively low ABV package. Totally satisfying, not the least bit thin or watery. Would work nicely with a light barrel treatment ... or as a hearty breakfast beer.

2 Nice color and aroma. Bready, caramel/toffee notes, with chocolate finish. Also great as a float but somewhat boozy

5 Nice, well made dark beer. Flavors work well together. Touches of coffee and chocolate but not much. Front of palate is hit with a sweet, almost cherry taste and the vanilla flavor settles after. Tan 2 finger foam laces the glass. Smooth but clean mouth feel lingers for a time after finishing.

4 Poured from a fresh growler into pint glass, pitch black color, a finger of mocha head that disappears quickly. Moderate carbonation, medium body. Not as thick as I thought it would be, more oily and smooth. Not a bad thing, though. Aroma is vanilla and sweet caramel, with hints of roast coffee. Taste is the opposite, roast coffee and dark chocolate forward, with sweetness underneath as a smooth balance, not too bitter. The coffee has a definite roasted note, not burnt. Beautiful balance, one of the smoothest stouts I've had.

4 Pours a thick black with little mocha head. The smell is sweet with heavy chocolate and coffee notes, with a few hints of cinnamon as well. The taste starts sweet and heavy, with the spices coming on then finishing very spicy with some heat. Almost like a chili pepper beer. It has a heavy thick mouthfeel, smooth, with very little carbonation. Overall a drinkable beer but the spicy finish deters me from liking it.

3 This tastes exactly the way it sounds.  I'd like to drink it with a big plate of beans.

5 O: A richly-flavoured, very well-made stout. Sturdy enough to suggest sippability, but silky enough to support sessionability. Versatile and recommended.

3 O- I accidentally aged this one that got lost in the back of the cellar, but it ages gracefully! All of the flavors are meshed and mellow, good stuff

2 Flavor is modestly roasty and very chocolatey at first, finishing lightly bitter and rye dominant. There's some dark fruit notes that add complexity.

5    This beer was very comforting. Started out with a strong flat cola taste (I find this to be positive), and finshed with a bunch of roasted coffee.

1 Pours dark with a small head. Smells malty and roasted. Taste like the smell. A bit bitter though on the back end. Picked up some vanilla as it warmed. Love me some Bell's.

1 It's great! It's really smooth and creamy with a malty bite to it.

1 Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: Itâs dark and thick with a light tan head. The slowly fades out leaving just a ring of foam at the edge of the glass. Lacing is mostly slick. Smell: The aroma has a light toasted grain character with hints of almond like nutty notes and cherries. Taste / Palate: The flavor has a tart cherry roasted maltiness up front. As it warms I get more roasted coffee like malt notes. The finish has a mix of light tartness and bitterness. Carbonation and palate feel right on.

I really needed to try this one fresh to get the true flavor but I can guarantee you that it should not be aged. The mouthfeel dries out too fast and there isn't enough body to sustain it in the cellar. The cherries should have stayed on the trees or gone into some nice preserves or something. Keep your cherries out of my beer please. Skip this one in the future and pay the extra money for the Bell's Expedition Stout; totally worth it.

If you like sour beers, though, you will enjoy this one.

5 Poured a rich, deep dark black body with brown highlights when held to light and one finger of thick, fluffy tan head. Overall impression of appearance is of a fantastic stout. Very nice. Scents of dark chocolate, smokey strong roasted malt upfront, medium-light black coffee up front and a light sweetness and a light fruity aroma. Overall impression of aroma is of a fantastic dry stout, very roast malt-forward and quite nice. Flavor begins lightly dry with strong notes of smokey roast malt, lighter amounts of fruity flavors reminiscent of raspberries, flavors of rich dark chocolate and strong black coffee also apparent, there is a light sweetness present as well. Middle opens up further dry roasted malt and smokey flavors along with bittersweet chocolate and black coffee. Finish is dry with notes of smokey malt, black coffee and bitter cocoa, with a smokey, ashy note. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of roasted malt, smoke, and dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee, the way I make it. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice dry stout. Deep, dark, roasty and bitter, well worth trying. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a drying, roasty feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice stout, true to form, light yet full enough, very nice. Overall this is a fantastic dry stout. If you like a good stout, that is true to style, dry and full try this one, it's a good one.

1 Coffee smell and taste cold. As it warms up the chocolate comes through and taste sweeter.

3 Dark, dark rubyish color, kinda looks like a really dark coke color. Pours a dense tan head, that dissipates quickly. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes chocolatey and coffee like. Has somewhat of a medium creamy mouth feel. It kinda feels a bit more like a porter than a stout. regardless it is one tasty beer.

Just for kicks I added a small pour of bourbon to the second half of the glass and it made it quite nice

I prefer the beer taste from the tap instead of bottled. When you open the bottle you smell bourbon. You can taste the bourbon, but it is not overwhelming.  You should try this beer
5 On tap at Fordâs Fish Shack in South Riding and served in a small snifter. The beer is a dark brown thatâs nearly opaque, but shows some cola highlights when held to the lamp. Minimal head once it got to the table which settled to a sheen. Clearly a barrel aged beer from the aroma which is deep with vanilla and oak. There are roasted malt, molasses, and char notes as well. Taste is not exciting and leads off watery. It is moderately sweet with vanilla, molasses, and a dusting of cocoa. It is also moderately bitter on the finish with espresso, oak, char, and roasted malt flavors. A weak medium body, thin texture, moderate carbonation, and a sweet woody finish.

1 DATE TASTED: April 4, 2015... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: the Easter vigil is upon us--and my Lenten sacrifice is over... APPEARANCE: dark brown, thick and rocky head; thins but stands moderately still as the pour finishes; dark black body... AROMA: some rum fragrances early; peaty and sweet, with some woody notes; some chocolate and milk as well... PALATE: soft and smooth, with some lactic qualities--holds a reasonable aftertaste but doesnât intrude; medium-bodied and subtly creamy... TASTE: a nice blend of lactic chocolate and darker, malty flavors; drinkably agreeable without being thin; good balance of alcohol and flavor; the woody hints are just that--a pleasant brew for the early spring months rife with wind and rain; just a touch of vanilla makes this end with a peaceful atmosphere .....OVERALL: I first drank this years ago from a holiday sampler, but in seeking its standalone, I find it a worthy first beer after a long Lenten journey; an all-around balanced stout with enough nuance to stand out...

2                                          Overall: Ehh it's okay...has much room for improvement. Not bad but not great either. Nice dinner beer as opposed to the dessert that i would normally crave. Salud!

4 Good beer in my book..nice appearance with a khaki head and lots of lacing..smells chocolatey and and a little roasty..taste is the same with a thin to medium mouthfeel..B to B-Depending on the mood I'm in

1 12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods. Nose of dark chocolate and roasted barley. Taste of black coffee and bittersweet cocoa. Carbonation is spritzy and refreshing. Finish is semi bitter and toasty. A lot of flavor with an exceptional dry finish that makes it very drinkable. Well done.

1 Expired (but bottle conditioned) almost three months ago, still an excellent beer. In large snifter, couldn't quite get the head to the top (unless I wanted to really overdo things, leaving the beer about only 25% liquid). Opaque dark brown to black. Frothy, lightly-creamed coffee colored head, with bubbles increasing in size as it slowly dissipates. Sticky, fast drying lace. Smells of roasted and sweet malts and chocolate, taste is somewhat similar but favors roastiness and chocolate more than sweetness, especially in the back. Like a medium roast coffee, so tangy/acidic qualities, but with a pinch of hop bitterness and spice. Seems lower than 55 IBUs, which indicates excellent balance. Thick, rich brew with perfect, prickly level of carbonation. A little oily, mostly noticeable on teeth. Warming, but not drying at all on my palate. This stout is right up there with some of the better black ales in my book.

Malt forward but not my favorite.  A bit bitter

Black body with a light brown head that quickly thins. Dark unsweetened chocolate taste that I can't identify. Roasted malt is more present than the chocolate in the taste. Mildly bitter.
4 A Stout as a session beer? That's nearly what this was as it felt weak and I couldn't taste or detect the alcohol when I finally made my way through this. Some dark fruits, booze, and maybe another chocolate malt would have taken this up another level and with offerings like the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout still on the shelf, why reach for this? It's only a go if you plan on downing a few at a time to go with your dessert of the moment.

4 On tap at Dinosaur bbq in Syracuse.  Dark, malty. Little bit of bite to it. There is a little bitterness in the after taste.  Nicely done strong ale.

3 This is a bit better than okay.  It looks good in the glass, and the bottling will have you thinking it's either incredible, or you're worthless if you find it otherwise.  I'm confident enough to call it like I taste it.  It's okay, but there are many better options, especially at this price point...IMO.  Strong flavors aren't enough to be great.  Try one to see if you disagree...

2 Overall: This is an average strong ale for me. The aromas had some promise but i was disappointed in the taste. Theres not enough malt to balance out the hops. I thinks its too hoppy and bitter for the style. I really enjoy a few of Stones' IPAs but i personally feel they are a bit overrated as a whole. Ill probably pass on this one from now on. Cant really go wrong at $5 a bomber though

Has sweet malty flavors and bitter hops for a great combo. Excellent ale.

1 O:  Fantastic complexity and flavors from this beer.  It has a lot going on and each sip is a true pleasure.  Buy it if you can find it.  The beer has a lot of good whiskey flavors going on but the components are also shining brightly.  A little more heft in the mouth would have been nice though.

1                                           Super smooth beer considering alcohol%. Nice sweetness to this. Didn't taste barrel aging , but it didn't matter. Very good.

6 Introduced to to some new craft beer guys. Lots of booze smell but super balanced flavor. Mostly caramel flavor, some chocolate and Boise but so balanced. Great beer.

6 Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, char, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, cookie dough, and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid cocoa and fruit aspects, but I am not getting any of the Belgian yeast they supposedly used in this one.

Maybe I let this one age a little too long, but I thought with the high ABV it would be ok.  This wasn't very good.  The look is awful, the taste is a bit on the medicine side, and it feels pretty bad.  I expected so much more based on what I'd read.  This missed the target on most fronts.

3                                                                                                                                                                                            Despite a nice aroma the taste and mouth feel were both surprisingly disappointing. I generally love golden ales, and the surface characteristics of this beer suggested that I would enjoy this one as well, but the actual taste did not bear that out.

With a lot of sediment at the bottom
5 I enjoyed some of their other offerings on tap yesterday, but this one from the bottle is a muddled sweet mess. I'm curious to know what the brewer was after with this one. Maybe a mistake and under attenuated due to the strong sweet flavor and lack of carbonation.  Reading the notes saying there are 10 different hops used is interesting. This may have helped lead to the muddled flavors. 10 different hops is a lot to try to balance.

6 Perhaps this style isn't exactly my thing, or the bottle was off, but i did not enjoy this. Very strong and overly sweet. Molten malt body with very little hop presence. Barrel notes overpowering.

3                                                           O: Rich, smooth, and indulgent, bordering on being too sweet, but still a hell of a beer.
4                                                    O- big and malty with plenty of bourbon flavor and aroma, it is drinking a hit hot at this point
5 Overwhelmingly warming from the alcohol. Save this as a dessert. Think dark treacle on the tongue. Very thick body with a low level of carbonation.

2             Tried this at the brewery this weekend and it's phenomenal! The Brandy barrels sweeten it up just a touch compared to the original but it didn't get cloying.

5 Plenty of licorice, cinnamon, and dried plums. The barrel aged aspect of it is its saving grace, otherwise I would not drink it. Prefer the Bourbon Barrels Aged version.

1 Pours a clear deep reddish amber producing 2 fingers of soap foam frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head that leaves a only a little lacing. Aroma is sweet with toasted malts, treacle, nuts & a hint of raisin backed a thin hint of floral hops. Taste is sweet but less so than in the nose, caramel, roast, nuts & raisin. Finish is toast, roast & metallic with some hop character in the form of a nice bitterness that's accentuated by the alcohol & intense roast. Aftertaste is metallic, lightly bitter & astringent. Alcohol presence is low for the ABV but is present in the form of bitterness and spice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, some spicy prickle, wet, slick & astringent in the aftertaste.

6 3/26....pours reddish amber. Low foam, light on the bottom. Sweet caramel nose, bready, light cherry nose. Taste opens sweet, some astringent flavors. Borders on barleywine. Sharp bitter. Boozy. Very flavorful, but almost a wine/wiskey taste.

5 First few sips were magic, but I noticed an off almost artificial taste as the beer warmed.  I love the style, but this one didn't do it for me.

3 Served in my GI tulip at 46 degrees.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a rocky, two-inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks.  Heady eventually settles into a consistent slick leaving swaths and spots of lacing as it recedes.  Nose expresses toffee, caramelized sugar and ethanol.  Taste consistent with nose - the caramel/toffee presence really pops and lingers between quaffs; it's almost sickeningly sweet.  Figs and prunes become evident as the beer starts to warm.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to medium, with a mild, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture.  Overall, quite good but not my favorite blend - best shared amongst 4-6.  A little goes a long way.

2                                                           I'm not typically a fan of fruit themed brews, but this is quite tasty.  The fruit is very aromatic, but still very balanced to taste.  Great if you're sitting down for one or two.

6 This is not your girlfriend's gateway fruit beer!  Well balanced (malty, sweetness, bitterness) strong ale that is cloudy in appearance and supports a healthy dose of fresh raspberry tart w/o being too sweet - can have more than one pint.

4 A earthy/dirt like aroma followed by a thin ale that while hiding it's alcohol well, doesn't make sense with the lightly noticeable chocolate notes. A rare miss by Boulevard in their Smokestack series.

3 The feel is this beer's worst aspect.  It's not clean, though it starts fairly smooth.  It gains a roughness and astringency.  It ends with lots of graininess, and it can't quite seem to figure out whether it's sweet or dry.
4                                                                                                                                                          If I mixed real beer with half crappy beer this is what I would expect.

5 No date on bottle, almost no carbonation and very murky. No hop bitterness and very very sweet, lots of malt for sure but pretty one noted. Mouthfeel was very cloying and sweet. I suspect it was a very old bottle.

5 This is the yellow fizzy beer Stone Brewery warns you about. Save yourself some cash and buy Coors for more of the same, or step your game up.

2 Aroma: bourbon, malt, vanilla, no hops, Appearance: Dark brown, Â¼â head that quickly dissipates. Flavor: rich malt flavors, slight chocolate, caramel, some vanilla with bourbon in the background. A touch sweet but balances the malt and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel: moderate body to moderate full, moderate carbonation. Overall: the bourbon flavor is very well done and the rich malt goes very well with the bourbon barrel aging. The alcohol is there but is not as noticeable as 9.1% alcohol would suggest. It is very smooth and drinkable.

Bitterness and pale malts and really no hint of alcohol flavor.  Deceptive.  Good stuff.
6 Oh boy, we've got a big one here. Bright tawny hue, topped with a tiny bubbled lacing. Floral alcohol, biscuity malt, & mild fruitiness in the nose. Creamy, smooth, almost cordial-like. Boozy but not hot, biscuity malt from start to finish. This is a massive brew, easy to sip but the alcohol gives a kick to the palate letting me know I should be taking my time. Beer geek delight with this one.

3 Overall: as a general thing I simply do not understand this style.  If this is your type of thing then I would suggest getting a bottle because for what it is it does a very good job.  If you don't care for this style don't expect this beer to change your mind.  Overall pretty good, great even just not for me.  Also hab11 just reminded me thus was aged in Oak barrels.  I got no barrel presence whatsoever.  No oak tannins from which this beer could have greatly benefitted.  Not for me but maybe for you.

Pours a nice head that subsides to a thin ring of retention, shows some leg. It is tart, nice solid body.  Roast is subtle, like dark chocolate covered cherries.

6 Murky yellowish-brown pour, fizzy white head. Funk and lacto sour in the aroma, sourdough. Could already tell it was gonna be an acid bomb. Upon tasting, way too acidic and sour, pretty much too much to make any fruit in there enjoyable. Toasted wheat and a metallic finish. Medium body. Not undrinkable, but I definitely wouldn't want more than a few ounces.

5 Extremely sour. Wish I had had it side by side with the other Sour in the Rye variations, but as far as I can remember I preferred the Kumquat version. Added a lot more sour with some tropical resiny citrus character. Very nice.

1                       Glorious magenta colored sour ale with subtle blueberry accents. World class.

3 Fairly sour beer. Blueberry is subtle, though blends nicely. Nice, but I would like more blueberry.

5 Really delicious. It's extremely tart, but the cherries come through on the backend and this is very drinkable.

3 This is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall nice stuff with lots barrel flavor to balance the tartness. I would drink this again if the opportunity presented itself.

2 Malty aroma has a tart fruity overtone and a hint of horehound. Pours a clear, dark mahogany with a thick wheat head. Malty flavor has woody and tart fruity notes, giving it an almost wine-like nature. Smooth texture has good fizz and rather wine-like body, leaving a tart and woody finish. Distinctive, enjoyable, tasty.

This leaves you missing big flavors. I wanted more cherry, or fruit forward sourness coming through. It lacked a big vinegar backbone. It had very little funk.

4                                             Not quite into the sours yet to appreciate this. I thought the flavors were good, but the tartness just overpowered the beer for me. I'd like to try it on draft to see if it would change my mind.
5 O: Overall this is one damn fine beer..  tart, and sour, but with a deepness of flavor that I don't often experience in other sour style beers. I almost wish I got a little more of the oak from this, but still pretty damn close to perfect.

2 Corked and caged 750 ml bottle from Tipples. Pours deep reddish orange color with a nice fluffy off white head. Aroma is muted with some metallic and cardboard notes, oak, some light sour funk, sweet fruit and a vinous presence. Flavor follows as a beautiful combination of sweet fruit, red wine, sour lacto, dry oak. Wow this is really nice. No sign of the whiskey here, but I am OK with that. The wine barrel and sour notes really take over. Medium heavy body, medium plus carbonation. Really nice beer overall.

2 Very impressive! Sort of reminded me of supplication but the Michigan peaches made me like this that much more. Despite being close to 2 years old, the peaches could not have tasted any more fresh and everything about this beer just seemed so fresh. Very nice blend of fresh peaches, oak, bourbon, leather, and supposedly horse (not a flavor familiar to me, just reading from the label). Would like to obtain another bottle in the future or if I'm lucky enough to try the elusive vsb.

1 Sanctification is a great mild sour ale.  It's got some fruit, a little sweetness, a little tart, and a little funk.  It's crisp and refreshing and extremely drinkable (if you like a little tartness).  Lovely stuff.

1                               O: This met my expectations. I have to put ddg ahead of this just on complexity but this is a solid beer worth seeking out. I'd like to try this fresh but a little age has been solid. Russian River delivers again.

5 Bottle, batch 002. Clear piss yellow pour with a hint of white head. Enticing lemon zest and funk aromas. Tart, crisp, and clean with all kinds of lemon zest, sour vinous & grapefruit, barnyard, and funk notes. Absolutely freakinâ delicious...

2 Bottle date 06/18/2014, aged about 10 months in bottle. Taken out of fridge and allowed to warm up.  Poor a bright golden colour with lots of visible carbonation. Fruity smell, and dry fruity taste. Not too sour. Surprisingly carbonation seems to die down as warm up and don't get much drinking. Great beer, would love to get more of these.

6 Bottled 1/16/15. Very much in the style of a Flanders Red. All around very tasty, with a good balance between sour and sweet, but a bit undercarbed for me. I'd happily drink this anytime I'm in the mood for a sour, but, given the choice, I'd probably pick up a Rodenbach Grand Cru before this since I could get twice as much for the same price.

5 11.2oz bottle $3.99. I remember reading this was a classic porter so why not. Black with a filmy head that laces the glass. Aroma is yeast and dough. Flavor is slightly smoky, roast malts, touch of chocolate. Not my favorite but not bad, worth a try.

1 Pours a moderate head, under a finger, mostly larger bubbles which sizzle off quickly, there is some lacing but itâs extremely thin lines with not great stickiness. The liquid is a murky brown, fully opaque, develops a yellow tint at the rims and surface, you can see a few strands of bubbles within but you are more likely to spy particulate floating about. The nose is at once compact and expressive, German chocolate cake, licorice, vanilla cake icing, toffee, kind of too sweet for real smokiness to  show, curious lack of fruit scents, quiet raisin and prune at best, lingers with minimal effort. Full-bodied, layers creamily on the tongue, however, here you get something like bitter chicory which brightens the attack. Low carbonation, more fluffy than refreshing. Licorice, pine sap, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, molten chocolate, roasted chestnuts and scone flavors keep the sweetness on parade, one could argue there is an uptick in the plum, prune, raisin, cherry fruit. The finish is somewhat flat-footed, yet no faulting the intensity of the flavors it chooses to spotlight. Does a reasonably good job of masking the alcohol.

4 Very bold taste. Strong for a porter. Definite notes of black cherry, chocolate, and coffee. Not for those just starting to try porters or stouts.

6 Overall - This has a great whiskey flavor.  The grain character of the whiskey actually comes through really nicely.

6 Pours clear, deep brown color.  Thick head that doesn't dissipate too quickly.  This is a heavy, malty-sweet beer. Creamy with a caramel after taste.

4 Overall, IMO the aroma is rather subdued, but the flavor definitely makes up for that. The mouthfeel, though true to the style, was a little thin for my taste, very good though.

2 Pours a black color.  3/4 inch head of a tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol, hops, slight yeast, and a hint of tart.  Fits the style of a Baltic Porter.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, hops, hint of yeast, and slight tartness.  Overall, good appearance, average aroma and body, (but too much roasted malt and not enough tartness), and average feel.

I have to wonder if this is an older keg, as the beers has a stake taste that I've experienced from BA beers that sit too long after bottling

Stern alcohol warmth amplifies the spiciness of the porter and highlights its oaky tannins and sultry bourbon caramels and vanillans.

5 Fine example of a nice well-rounded porter. Sweet toasty chocolate malts are perfectly balanced by a bit of cola, black pepper, some nice walnut, and a bit of spicy floral hops on the backside. Only had this beer and One Oatmeal Stout from Dark Horse but I will be looking out for them in the future. These guys seem to really know their stouts.

4 O: I will preface this by saying that I absolutely hate smoked beers, but this was really enjoyable. I'm done doubting Mr Hill, the hype is justified.

1 This has the lacing and body of an RIS. There are actually some RISs that could learn from this. Very roasty and malty, with a somewhat sweet and bitter finish. This is an impressive porter.

4 Taste is more subtle than a lot of chocolate beers, but that could be because it's a porter and not a stout. You do get the bitter crisp feeling from the porter and not the creaminess of a stout. Dark cocoa powder and burnt mocha flavors dominate. I like that's it's not in your face but definitely is still chocolatey. Maybe I'm a sucker for a chocolate beer or maybe the eaters have fallen victim to the appeal to average bias. I say try this one if you like coco, bro.

3 Outlier. Pretty noticeable alcohol and I did't get any peanut butter. A little berry flavor late. My least favorite of the framinghammers. Still really good, just more of a J than a PB&J.
4        O: This beer is one of a kind. I know there are a lot of PB&J beers this doesn't have much peanut butter but the awesome jam taste and the bourbon crank this beer to another level.

6 O: Not the best porter for me, but really close.  I certainly wouldn't ever turn one away.  Super excited to try one of the variants.. I believe some vanilla would make this thing sing.  The PB&J version sounds just crazy enough to be excellent.

3 Pours with an undersized, bubbly weak head ... and that's the end of my noteworthy complaints.  The body itself is a dark ruby-brown color.  The rich aroma is loaded with dark fruit notes, particularly raisin and dried plums, and has hints of chocolate, dark bread and coffee.  The flavor does not disappoint.  It is rich and fruity, with hints of dates, raisins, dried plums, toffee and faint coffee.  The high ABV is a bit too obvious here but there aren't really any overly boozy aspects. e.

5 Having allowed the finely corked bottle to sit for about 20 minutes, it began with a quick rush and slowly settled into a dark ruby body capped with a heavy foam crown. There is a nose heavy on spice and wood. The palate receives an intense miasma of black cherry, malt and nut, supplemented by a boozy finish that suggests a tanic red wine. The balance could be better and the mouthfeel more weighty. Add a plate of Irish cheddar and ..... yes! All in all, a nice quaff to while away a snowy March afternoon.

A floral aroma with vanilla and coconut. Flavors were coconut, hazelnut, onion, and caramel. Did not get the barrel or wine flavors that others are noting. Maybe need a second try as I was 10 beers into a tasting. Mouthfeel was nice with light body and a dry finish.

3 Middle of the road porter. Many better options out there for the price. 2.5's are proper.
4                                           Strong Baltic Porter.  Worth a try!  Drinkable.

4 Overall: a pleasant mix of attributes from a good lager, the maltiness of a porter and the saltiness of an oyster stout. Good with chicken, bbq or any grilled meats â palate cleansing and not so powerful as to overwhelm your meal.
5                                                     1/14...pours very dark brown with some white foam. Coffee nose, faint, little bitter. Strong coffee bitter flavor. Some grittiness. Smooth chocolate coffee all around. Very good.

2 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The beer is a dark deep coffee brown hue with a dark and dense, creamy-foamy brown head that retains and laces quite well. The aroma is initially a bright, sweet cherry note with a wood character and a background note of caramel that strengthens later. The taste is a balanced medium high bittersweet. Itâs thick and syrupy, with a touch of stickiness and a creamy thick head. The medium-full body has lots of chocolate and coffee notes. Thereâs some jolly rancher sugary fruits tucked away in there too that come through more at the finish which is primarily caramel syrup in flavor and texture that brings with it a subtle tabacco note that lingers mildly in the waxy, dry coffee aftertaste - kinda like smoking a mellow cigar.

1 Great beer!  Aroma was pleasant, flavor and taste enhanced by leaving it out for a while. A solid offering.

6 I'm pretty sure I have had this a few times by now and held off thinking I would get it again for the review. The time is now and my high expectations are satisfied by the great balance of deep chocolate and toasty brown things.

Taste sweet malt, caramel, cola, hint chocolate. A little light for a Porter!

It's boozy and has a bold malt presence, but lacks some of the dark malt character and taste that would make it more distinct for the style. Seems to fit more into a strong ale or barley wine category than a porter. Decent yet unimpressive.

6 Raisin caramel molasses It taste almost exactly like it smells except there is a minor discernible hop bitterness and flavor. The malts are the superstar of this beer and they are fantastic. It is medium bodied but the creamy texture almost makes it seem heavier. For such a rich beer it goes down very easily. IN some ways this reminds me of a dunkel. Roasted flavors are non existent as are fruity ale flavors. This may be bottom fermented. I high recommend this, it is sweet and delicious.

1 Overall, this is a great Baltic porter. Very complex but very drinkable. This is a solid beer, and easily the best Baltic porter Iâve had.

3 I was hoping for a bit more influence from the yeast, which makes me pay so much attention to all things Belgian. I enjoyed it enough to leave the door open to other Brasserie de Cazeau beers.

1 Oddly reddish brown in color with a murky complexion.  There's a trace of beige head mostly present around the rim of the glass and barely elsewhere.  The aroma is rather off putting with loads of malt and alcohol.  The flavor is packed with loads of malt and the alcohol is detectable.  The mouth is sticky and chewy.

5 Less fruity than I'd thought it'd be.  Pleasing, better than I'd expected.

3 Reddish-brown hue, mostly clear liquid with just a slight haze.  Blanket-like foam head.  Decent lace.  The smell is estery and malty...spice and dark fruit.  Nice complexity.  Semi-dry, with good malt and yeast flavor.  Solidly good.

3 This sound like such a good idea, but it's not really much fun. From the mercifully bottle-capped 750 ml bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquor in Denver.

2 Disappointing beer. I thought it looked and smelled nice, but the flavor is decidedly average. Maybe the worst I've had from Brewery Vivant, but this is at worst uninteresting and drinkable. Worth a look, most especially if you're looking to try out a Belgian beer that isn't IN YOUR FACE.

3 Overall- Not a very good beer in my opinion.  I am not a big fan of many of the beers from Sweetwater and this is one of them.

5 Pours a reddish black with a finger of bubbly white head. The aroma is pretty typical of a Belgian, with esters and clovex present. The taste is initially similar, but there's definitely a smokiness there. Medium-light mouth, and the carbonation gives it a nice crispness. Not a bad little brew.

1 On draft at Slater's 50/50 in Pasadena.  Really thin and medicinal (it tasted like what a band-aid smells like). Will have to try again some other time and (hopefully) re-score.

This also had a very foamy, active head, but it settled down soon to a nice light thin cover, some lace, and a dark brown color. Aroma is yeast and malt. Flavor is similar to nose, dry, and a bit gamey. Body is decent. Technically good, but esthetically not so much.

5 cheeky here, from hell, with an abv of 666, i mean, nice guys! the beer is cool but i think its the lesser of the two, still, neat to try them side by side. this isnt all that dark, somewhat of a brown ale look to it, nice froth and excellent carbonation on the feel. the nose is more belgian yeast than dark malt, and the flavor has quite a bit of hops to it. sort of a weird in between as far as styles go, with the belgian yeast in a hoppy darker beer. unique though, and real drinkable with just a subtle dark malt flavor to go with the bittering hops and fruity ester heavy yeast. seems light with the soda pop carbonation, but something is weird with the proportions of this one, as drinkable as it is. i liked this, but probably wouldnt buy it. the from heaven version though is an outstanding belgian pale, definitely worthy of being stocked in the fridge. again, cool to have these opposing brews in succession.

3 I can't believe Navette doesn't get more love here. Very nice Belgian Black Ale...tastes delicious and goes down incredibly smooth.

3 A very nice dark ale, a style which is rapidly becoming a favorite.  This is absolutely delicious and just sweet enough to be desirable but not cloying.  The price point is reasonable.  The only negative point for me is the absolute lack of head and lacing.

6 750ml Bottle - Sep 26, 2007. Strong, creamy Bosc pear flesh, perfectly ripe and imbued delicious yeasty esters. Peppery and with sandalwood. Pours a paler shade of amber, with a soapy sparse tinted head. Flavor is a lilting pale fruits and light esters. Nice sugar character, with bits of brandy, oatmeal and caramel. Mingling between caramelization backed with nuttiness and the brighter more alive fruits. Airs of scotch, foamy brine, and muskmelon. Palate is explosive and heavily carbonated, which makes it bright and brings a dancing soft air quality to it. Eventually as this beer settles and breathes and becomes familiar it reveals the heavy Munich use, making it a bit of a Belgian Oktoberfest. If that makes sense. Really not a bad beer...Thanks Rudy for an awesome extra!

6 Pours a dirty brown hue with a subtle one finger head that stays and leaves nice clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is chestnuts,dried fruits,candi sugar and a touch of milk chocolate,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated over moderate and the tastes are milk chocolate,dried fruits,candi sugar and finished with a roasty nuttiness and overall a pleasant surprise not fantastic but easy to drink.

4                 I liked this better on tap. It was much fruitier and had a nice herbal earthy profile. Kind of floral. Going to age a few bottles and revisit later on.

6 Looks like an Amber. Smells fresh, bright, like floral spring time. Dried fruit, a little salty, coriander, a little citrus zest. This was the best of my sampler pack.

5 O- certainly not a stout, with more dark fruit than chocolate, still enjoyable though

1 M/O- The mouthfeel leans towards full bodied but it's not quite there, and the carbonation is refined and smooth.....this could qualify as a desert beer and would do well with a plum pudding or with a slice of Christmas cake or Rum cake!  It warms the senses and is quite nice on a wintery day such as the one I am reviewing this on!  It's a decent beer and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy something a little more complex!

Strange brew. Not the usual sweet spices but pleasant nonetheless. Worth a try if you can score just one.

1 Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was just slightly above average for a Belgian Dark Ale, it was pretty smooth, but in the end I thought it was just a little bland and I wish the taste was as bright as the aroma.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, a little crisp, not filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one glass is a good amount for me, I could drink the whole bottle, but I think after one glass I would start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they weren't bad, but they could both use just a little work.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, but i wouldn't turn down a glass and i can't say I would recommend this as a great example of the style.  All in all I was a little indifferent about this beer, I didn't hate it,but I didn't love it either, and I wish it was just a little more complex and interesting. This beer made an Ok first impression for this Brewery and I would be interested in trying more of their beers.   I didn't mind this beer, but I think it needs a little work, better luck next time guys.

1                         Would prefer a bit more tartness or sweetness...or both. A bit weak in flavor.

1 Draught: This one pours a ruby tinged mahogany color. There was a bit of an off white head that lingered and left some lacing. The nose was nice. Notes of cinnamon, toffee, caramel, some yeastiness and some dark fruits. The taste was also good. A bit of cinnamon and other spices, but not overly done. Nice malt body, with notes of toffee, caramel, dark fruits and some yeastiness. A decent brew!

4 Final Grade: 4.15, an A-. I am really enjoying my glass of Augustijn Brune, as it hits pretty much all of the major notes that I expect from this style, in addition to tasting quite excellent. Rich tasting and full-bodied; an excellent inclusion in this Van Steenberge sampler. A very good quality ale, though not quite on the same level as some of the better Belgian-style dark ales I've had over the years. Still, that's impressive company, indeed.

4 This pours a dark, medium brown color with a slight head. The aroma is sweet with caramel malts, molasses, and sugars. The taste is sweet and smooth which is very uncharacteristic of an Abbey Tripel as it drinks and tastes more like a thin stout. This very unusual taste will probably turn you off if you are Tripel drinker.

1 Pours a medium-dark brown with a moderate head. Pleasant aromatic aroma with burnt sugar and vanilla notes. A pleasantly sweet malty taste with an abrupt slightly bitter finish with grapefruit notes. Certainly a well crafted Belgian dark , but the ABV borders on a Strong Dark. Although not necessarily a bad thing, a Belgian Strong Dark would have considerably more flavor to reward the consumption. American craft breweries like to push the envelope of every style, and this is no exception. If the alcohol content were lower, in the realm of a Belgian Dark Ale it would be exceptional. As a Belgian Strong Dark it is middle of the road.

Dark, smooth, tastes cold. No overwhelming flavors and it's 8%.  Beautiful caramel color.

3 O:  Tasty brew and very easy drinking.  Fairly expensive for the ABV.  Think I will stick to more Belgian Strong Dark Ales.

3 Cloudy yellow, nice head. Lots of bitterness throughout, not very appropriate for the style, pepper and yeast, hints of dried citrus zest, herbs, farmhouse. Rough mouthfeel. I'd have to pass on more than a sample of this.

1 Still an interesting beer, but am not sure how much of this I could drink.  The pint I had WF's was all I can handle and then some.

2 Pours a finger of sudsy white head, fades rather fast with no lacing. Cloudy and straw yellow. Some particles floating around. Smells of malt and cloves, with hints of banana and bread dough. Tastes quite malty, with a tropical fruit following, mostly pineapple. Lingering hoppy bitterness. Mouth feel is astringent and lightly syrupy, with a medium-heavy body. Higher carbonation, leaves tingling sensation on tip of tongue. Overall, an interesting beer, a little off-balance, but decently complex and enjoyable. For the price, would not buy very often.

Lightly funky in nose and flavor. Light-bodied but the flavor profile has more malt than hops - even on the finish. The hoppiness becomes more assertive halfway through the glass but a sweet note remains throughout.

1 Aroma is very interesting with spices, yeast, hops and a bit of resin. Outstanding appearance with a huge billowy, off-white, semi-permanent head, with lots of lace and a clear honey amber color. Flavor's similar to nose with resin coming out more and lingering somewhat unpleasantly in the finish. Body is on the soft side which enhances that resin finish. Otherwise it's a real good drinking beer.

Sweet fruit taste clashed rather than enhance. Also, somehow even with the big flavor, the alcohol was noticeable. This one was bottled in 2011, so maybe the age detracted.

4 Toffee sweetness, confectioners sugar, pear, green apple, and clove dominate the aroma. Great ester profile. There's a hint of must. Flavor reveals tart crabapple at the base, with notes of peach leading into a slightly sweet, toasted malt backbone. The finish is peppery and a touch bitter.  Perfumey esters add complexity. Alcohol surfaces in the aftertaste. That tart character dominates a bit more than I'd prefer, and adding in the booze makes it almost have an acetone quality.

2                                         Overall, this definitely comes across more as a pale ale or IPA than a Belgian-style ale, but it is delicious and I would definitely buy it again.

4 Overall this was an interesting beer. Tasty, drinkable and it hides the alcohol quite well. I did pick up some metalic taste in the finish but the friend who shared this with me did not.

3 With the only difference being the yeast supposedly, there are some major differences. Unlike the Stone IPA (IPA) being a hazy gold color, the Cali-Belgique (CB) is crystal clear. The smell is also drastically different, the aroma is overwhelmed by spicy, belgian yeast aromas with only hints of the pine and citrus. The taste reflects this exactly, tastes like the IPA but overwhelmed by the flavors created by the Belgian Yeast. Overall an ok beer, but I definitely prefer the regular stone IPA. I feel the belgian yeast hinders the IPA flavor instead of improving it.

6 The hops are dominant in the aroma, a mixture of floral and grass accents. It pours a nice golden beer, with a white head that vanishes rapidly. The hops dominate the taste, which makes it a medium bitter beer. The texture of the beer is thin, and the initial hop accents are completely absent in the finishing.  Overall a nice beer, which tastes better if you drink it slightly warmer than the recommended serving temperature.

5 Lovely IPA from Belgium.  Alcohol well hidden and the frothiest head that I have ever seen on an IPA

I'd avoid it. I hate that beer has become so pretentious, and now we have people rating this sour white grape flavored beer with an overall score of 91 and 94!!!! Are you kidding me?

5 Overall, this is one of the most impressive uses of wine barreling weâve ever encountered.  The chardonnay flavoring just pours off of the oak, blending with the warming, bold graininess of a surprisingly bitter base tripel.  The result is rather mixed however.  You find cloying sugars clashing with the most intensely puckering and bittering phenols around, all with this grapey wine and ethanol flavoring that never fully clicks for us.  The biggest surprise here is that nose.  It tends towards the wild side, more so than either a Belgian IPA or a tripel (itâs hard to nail this down stylistically, as so many things are mentioned on the bottle, contrasting with what we actually get).  That is probably why we felt so discombobulated through the flavoring and beyond.  You never quite know where you are with this beer, and it leaves you questioning your own basic knowledge of beer.  As our introduction to Nebraska Brewing Company, this has certainly piqued our interest.

One of my favorites. If you haven't had it, seek it out. It can be difficult to find.

4 The nose is brown sugar with dark fruit hints of alcohol and vanilla. It pours hazy amber with a thick rocky head, alowly descenting to icebergs of foam that produce thick lace. Brown chunks suspended in the beer give it a snow globe quality or perhaps a desert sandstorm. The beer is not that old and there are no hints of oxidation on tha palate. On the palate the fruit starts as caramel sweetened peach that gradually becomes more raisin-like. The flavors at the beginning feature the alcohol interacting with the malt and the yeast while by the finish the interactions between the alcohol and the hops become more prominent. Medium body and carbonation.

4 O (4) - Overall a solid beer.  I've never *loved* any of the Peace Tree beers, but they're all good.  This is no different.

5 Rich deep golden colored with an inch thick head of tightly packed off white head.  Brussels lacing. The nose is fairly subdued but I get a bit of the acidic Belgian yeast with a hint of citrus hops.  The taste is intensely bitter citrus hops in the front of the palate.  As it hits the back of the palate you get a bit of that acidic champagne like dry Belgian yeast.  The yeast also provides a nice crisp finish.

4 22oz corked and caged bottle shared at Beachwood BBQ #bottlecherwednesday. Poured into a tulip, this beer is cloudy orange-yellow with a finger or so of white foam that settles to a thin layer thatâs retained for the duration. Lots of sticky lace rings and streaks are left behind. A very complex aroma includes citrus and tropical fruit, brett funk, acidic white wine, oak, some caramel malt, and a little vanilla. The flavors are just as layered, with a great interplay between sweet and sour bolstered by bitter underpinnings. Yeasty, funky, citrusy, oaky, and vinous. Very enjoyable to sip and savor. Medium body, a bit creamy in texture, lively carbonation, drying, puckering, long finish.

I say its very well done.

4 Pours a nice yellow color with a fluffy, cloud of white head. Smell was that of fresh cut grass and citrus. Taste was a full on hoppy blast mixed with grass and citrus and some what floral. Overall a great IPA!

Hop-forward, yet it maintained the characteristics of classic Belgian brews. R E C O M M E N D E D  !
6 22 ounce bottle, bottled on 02/25/2015.  Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like stone fruit, apples, citrusy and pine hops, and bready malt.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery spice, candied oranges, citrus peel and a bit of clove noticeable.  There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick, smooth and goes down easy.  Moderate carbonation.  I liked this brew, certainly worth picking up!  $11.99 a bomber.

2 O- mostly sweet and malty with lots of woodsy notes, but not so much bourbon.  it all seems to mesh well though, I enjoyed this one

5 Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, light wheat. Taste is also strong of citrus, a bit of wheat is present, a touch of spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer.

2 I'll admit, my first Belgian IPA...my frame of reference is Trappist brews and American IPAs. The IPAness is there, but it feels like a good Belgian ale, not a good IPA...I will have to reevaluate.

6 Poured a lively orangey amber. A big foamy white head takes a minute to settle down and leaves sticky lacing as it does. The aroma is mild, with just light hints of malt and a touch of yeast. The taste has a little bit of spice, but not much funk. It's kind of bland, as it goes along. The mouthfeel is adequate, with a just little spicy bite. It can't seem to decide if it's an IPA with a Belgian twist or a Belgian Wit with an IPA twist. In the end, it's muddled and not really either..

2 White Hatter brewed by New Holland Brewing Company, an has an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a cloudy amber color, with a small white head. There is a lot going on in this brew.  The smell is sweet, grains, and malts.  Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor. You pick up on some citrus, malts, and hops. This is a nice drinking brew. The mouthfeel is bold , but clean, and relishing. Overall I'm giving White Hatter a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. New Holland Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. There is also some things floating in this brew, but it a nice drinking brew.

Great with spicy food but to hoppy by itself for my taste.

2 One of the hoppier Belgian IPA's out there. Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into my Grape and Gourmet store tulip. Hazy apricot color with a big delicately bubbly white head. Head retention is better than average and the head looks more frothy after the bubbles die down.  Aroma is citrus and  floral hops, not much in the way of Belgian beer aspects.  Flavor adds some Belgian yeast and some light fruit to the big hoppy presence.  The yeast is fairly prominent and adds the Belgian to the Belgian IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp, bitter and fairly rich.  Overall, an interesting and well crafted beer.

1 Poured amber; slightly hazy; very large and durable bone-colored head; bands of sticky lacing. A full pour still left some dark brown sediment in the bottle. Very appealing aroma with brown bread, ripe fruits and a hint of toffee. The flavor follows largely, with intensity building through the finish and into the aftertaste. Very good sweet/bitter balance with an overall slightly sweet character. High ABV is well hidden in the nose, but only partly hidden in the feel and upon tasting. Nice hints of raisins and brandied dates, along with some hop notes, in the aftertaste. Tastes considerably darker than it actually looks. O: less well known than Piraat but worth seeking out.

5 A very underrated beer. Probably the best Belgian style Imperial IPA i've drunk so far in my life.

4 Maybe I'm a little biased, being from just an hour outside of Cleveland, but this is a spectacular brew.

1 O: This is supposed to be the hoppiest beer in Belgium but the hops are there as much for flavor as for bitterness. The bitterness is rounded and not harsh. Very easy to drink.

4 A Belgium white ipa. If that sounds good to you, you may enjoy. I didn't care for the taste, but Belgium whites and ipa's are not my favorite styles.
5                        Good strong spiced fruit aroma follows into the front and turns into a good hoppy bitterness and a nice boozy kick at the end.

1 Just the right hint of orange and not overly hoppy. Nicely done.

5 Just been drinking this beer on draught in a Wetherspoons pub.It was absolutely gorgeous.Looked good and tasted superb.I didnt realise it was so strong as it does not state the ABV on the pumpclip so it made a mess of me.Recommended.

5 Reviewed from tasting notes. A spicy, malty orange nose with a little Belgian barnyard and a suspicion of smoke. Pours hazy gold with a thin white head that produces good lace. On the palate, citrus and melon, rich malts, over ripe fruit and moderate bitterness with long lingering slightly bittered malt after tastes. medium high carbonation, medium full body.

6 I'm a big fan of Belgian style beers and what I can say about this beer is that it tastes good but its missing the wow factor. It is light or liquid in its mouthfeel which just doesn't make it feel like an iconic Belgian beer but its delicious and so easy to drink. I think this is the PERFECT way to describe this beer... It is the evolution of BMC (Bud, Miller, Coors) beers. If you know someone who likes BMC beers I can't imagine that they could dislike this beer. I'd venture that this would be the best beer they ever drank. That might sound like a weird way to describe the beer but it reminds me of a light beer like (BMC) but with the outstanding flavor of a Belgian beer mixed together. So it is light and effervescent but also flavorful. It stands at a nice 6.8% alcohol too. This would be great in the summer time or warmer weather. I was able to get it for about $2.50 per bottle, which is just too much for what it is. If it was offered for $1.50 per bottle (in a six pack) I could see myself buying this beer at parties for groups of people since I know everyone could drink it. From beer snob to a BMC drinker. The more I drank it the more I liked it. The first sip I wasn't blown away, but by the end of it I felt like a monk gave me his blessing. :-)

5 Not a bad Belgian pale ale here, this has more hop flavor than many so credit where its due.  The nose is pungent and musty, body light and crisp, and flavor more or less balanced.  A beer I could session though it is slightly abrasive.

2 So,  I may be a bit biased because I got twelve packs of this stuff for $9.99 on clearance in early summer of 2014.  Didn't expect much but really hit the spot, typical belgo pale flavors nothing stood out but a good warm weather quaff.

It lacks a bit of flavor complexity for me, especially in malt presence.

4 Lovely mouthfeel, great taste. Taste a lot nicer than the aroma would suggest. At first doesn't seem that inviting. Lots of estery yeasty flavour bananas, soft stone fruit bit of alcohol warmth that is well hidden but definitely there. Nice that this is fairly easy to get hold of in London pubs with pretty much nothing good on offer, seems to have replaced Leffe in a lot of places.

2                   Great beer! Good color and great taste! Would definitely recommend.
3 Tasty Belgian style. Amazing floral bouquet. Finish is a bit lacking. Very drinkable.

6 Poured a deep clear blond with a moderately retentive white head. Nice sticky lacing left. The aroma is mild, fruity and yeasty. The taste is very similar but a little more robust. The body has a nice light weight to it, with just a little bit of carbonation on the finish.

3 O: The thin body might not have been so objectionable if the flavor profile had been more notable. I'd have this again, but I wouldn't go to a lot of trouble to seek it out. Not one of Unibroue's better offerings.

5 An average belgian ipa.  Not a lot of aroma.  Has a nice belgian yeast flavor to it.  About average overall.

1 Very mediocre representation of this style. Kind of tastes like a watered down triple.

4 Effervescent and crisp. head dissipates quickly. orange/amber borderline in color. earthy, musty, hoppy scent. horseblanket brett'ey on the nose and palate. Very brett forward. Possible age on the 4 pack I purchased. Drinks very nice. Though, would love a fresh take on this.

3 D: This was a decent Belgian ale. The scent and taste were fitting for the style but didn't do anything to stand out. The body was a little weak, but the finish was smooth, so it was pretty easy to drink. Not a bad drink, but entirely forgettable.

6 Wow there's a lot of caramel here that does not belong. I guess you can't rate against a style that is the invention of a corn busting macro.

2 Refreshing grass, sugar, spiced yeast, a bit funky. Hints of spice, especially clove. Sweet, refreshing, hay and yeast adding up well with the spices, hints of honey. Very well balanced, perfect fitting carbonation, which leads to a smooth, fresh mouthfeel. Clove is big in this, without being too present on the tastebuds. Results in a warm, yeast supported, pleasant finish.

I'll look for it again as perhaps I got a bad bottle.
2 American Trappist... all-right, I'll bite. Poured a clear, golden amber into my tulip. 2 fingers of fluffy white head and great carbonation. Spicy, Belgian yeast notes on the aromas, with some nice dark fruit and even citrus notes shining through. Classic flavors of a Belgian pale from my admittedly limited experiences. Reminded me a bit of GI Sofie. The nice citrus notes and peppery bite on the finish had me anxiously taking the next sip. Nice clean finish with some of the lingering yeast notes fading away. A nice buy. US monks, supporting charity, delicious= multi-level winner.

6 Brew pours a golden-honey in color with a small white foamy head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the glass. The aroma is of Belgian yeast along with some light fruit, maybe pears. The taste pretty much follows the nose with some light foral hops in the mix also. Very smooth and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Lighter bodied with medium carbonation. Overall a tasty brew.

5 Overall - A very good beer, but I never know what to expect from a Belgian IPA (meaning it's hard to compare against others, and hard for me to judge to style).  3.75 paws.

2 Poured into a tulip glass. Amber/orange with a large white head that lingers.  Malt smell with a little sweet/sour in the background.  Taste sweet malt with a little sour aftertaste, mild fruit taste in the background.  Medium carbonation with a nice crisp finish.

3 Overall: Not realizing that this brewery focuses on belgian style ales, i saw amber ale on the label and went for it. I dont know why this is classified as an amber ale? Its a straightforward belgian pale ale if you ask me. It has that classic Belgian spice and yeast with some fruit complexity. One of the better American Belgian style ales iv had actually. Overall a solid beer in a style i normally wouldnt seek out

3 This feels weird to type...this is the first Ommegang product that hasn't blown me away. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it tastes a lot like a handful of other summer ales I've had. It's not something I'd feel confident being able to pick out of a crowd. That said, it's still crisp like a summer ale should be and it's worth buying again when it's actually summer. I have no earthly idea why it's available in February in Pennsylvania.

3 O - Excellent beer and will most certainly buy this when I see it. Excellent example of the style.

5 The first time I tried it I hated this beer. But than I tried it again and allowed myself to enjoy it slowly. Thats how I saw how tasty it is! It's as if in each bubble of carbonation there is a spice hidden inside

5 Final Grade: 3.65, a B grade. Augustijn Blond is a decent beer, but still not a very notable one. The alcohol is well-masked, and while the flavour profile is suitable and not at all offensive, this still strikes me as a forgettable Belgian pale ale. There just isn't anything jumping out at me about this one, for better or worse. I'd certainly consider having this beer again, and would consider it at least worth a shot - but don't expect anything more than a serviceable Belgian blonde.

5 It looks like a lambic or geuze, but is a bit darker with slightly more foam on it.  The taste and smell are also like a lambic or geuze, but the sourness is somewhat milder, probably caused by the blending with a flemish old brown beer. I was not a fan of sour beer in the beginning, but this beer has me started to appreciate the sourness.

5 Had a bottle from 2011 that was still in excellent condition. This beer is not an assault on the senses it is rather a gentle complex composition of Belgian yeasts, spices and barnyard aromas. Would drink this again any time if it was more accessible.

2 750mL bottle served in a Belgian tulip glass.  Beer pours chestnut brown in color with an ample head.  Classic, yeasty aroma.  Flavor is traditional BSDA: rich, yeasty, Belgian.  It's rich but not complex.  Dark, but there's no depth of grain flavor.  Dry in the finish, hoppy even.  Very drinkable, and perhaps a great introduction to the style for novice advocates of high-octane beer.  A solidly mediocre offering of a style with great potential.

Smells of hops and spice and everything nice.  Lightly carbonated and very smooth you can taste the high Alcohol in the finish.

2 Small head, dark body.  Aromas of dark malt, plums, raisins, and some vanilla and whiskey.  Lots of oak and cola notes with a bit of burnt malt lingering in the finish.  Medium thick body, average carb and a fairly dry finish.  Not bad, but it's a mediocre base beer with a less than stellar barrel treatment, not something that really needed to be made or that I would drink again.

6 Dried fruit aromas, dark pitted fruits, spice, dark sugars and a suspicion of fruitcake, traces of alcohol and some earthiness on the nose. Pours brilliant chestnut under a 1â white foam cap that slowly dissipates to a thin whisp of a head that never the less produces lace. Also has some legs. Fruit cake components start the palate with fig to dates, a hint of toffee, prune, dark cake, a little spice (coriander and anise) alcohol and an earthy hop finish. There is also some warming but the alcohol is not solventy or hot. It is surprisingly light for all it has going on and the alcohol levels â medium to medium high on the body and medium carbonation. A big beer with the presence of a port or a bourbon.

Aroma is a bit stale and is more reminiscent of an English Ale than a Belgian.  Plum, spices and some cola flavors.

6 Reddish brown with a fine white head. The spice aroma comes in right away with a subtle sweetness that has a brown sugar tinge to it. A bit of estery yeast in the  nose, not much. Pretty mild hops, had hoped for a piney profile. Didn't get it. The flavor is spicy in the initial with some clove-cinnamon, followed by the dried fruit of what to me was fig, raisin, and date which lent a brown sugar-honey combo. Very nice. Finishes with  the sweet and yeast for the signature Belgian flavor. As expected, the dried fruit, sweet, and estery  components increase as the beer comes to temp.

4 o: sweet, rich, complex, such a wonderful brew.  be sure to let this warm up before you drink it.  often available at the LCBO at a very affordable $3.50/bottle which is great too

2 I bought two of these and had them over the course of two nights. Nice dark color with a thick tan head that goes down very slowly. It's a very nice beer that would go well with steak and potatoes. However, Beer Advocate has the ABV wrong, it's actually 10.0.

1 O - a brilliant dark ale from Unibroue. This may be my favorite offering from them and that's saying something considering all the fine ales they bottle. Pure class of a brewery and their creative brewing and style are on full display with Maudite. Fantastic Belgian style ale.

4                  Final Thoughts: Much like the other brews I've had from Unibroue, this one impresses. While it is no Fin Du Monde, it's still an awesome beer. As I said, this one I could drink anytime, anywhere but I could really see it going good with mussels. Two thumbs up.

5 This was a beer I had set aside for my 1000th beer. I change my mind because I asked for a poll on this site (which got deleted -  but the admin gave me congratulations so I don't mind) and on the League on Facebook because it got deleted. I wish I hadn't listened to the poll, which voted for Barrel-Aged Bigfoot. This beer has phenomenal flavor, a darker color than anything I've seen in this style, and it is so smooth.

1 Dark reddish-brown pour with thin tan head. Smells of raisins, toast, and alcohol. Heavy fruit flavor with some alcohol, but finishes pretty clean. Whatâs left is a nice malty lingering aftertaste.

6 Hell Hath No Fury pours an extremely dark shade of brown - it's oily, with a hint of garnet, and almost black. In the context of this as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this is too dark for the style. The aroma also does not hint at its supposed style - I am picking up roasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, a touch of dark chocolate, and only the slightest hint of fruit esters one might expect. I am going to abandon scoring this beer within the confines of this style for the rest of the review, because it's clear to me that Bells did not intend to adhere to it so much. As for the flavor, I'm getting some dark fruit elements up front along with a sweet taste that's something along the lines of a 'Stella Doro' Italian cookie. The finish consists of bittersweet chocolate with much evidence of alcohol presence. Overall, this one tastes like it's not sure if it wants to be a Belgian Stout or a Strong Dark Ale... it doesn't excel at either point of view and it's not an interesting combination. Not a bad tasting beer by any means, but I would not buy it again.

5 While more sweet than my impression of this style would anticipate, Gregorius is enjoyable. Lacking layers and complexity expected of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this could be considered an entry level, after-work, relaxing beer.
6                                            Pours cloudy dark brown beer with 0.5-finger off-white head. Smell of dark fruits, apple and honey. Taste of dark fruits, candy sugar, raisin, warming alcohol. Medium-bodied, good brew.

4 Depending on how cold you keep your fridge, this needs a few to warm up a little to let all the goodness open up. Pours a dark, murky brown with a fizzy tan head that burns off quickly. There is no lacing. The aroma starts out a little tight, with some pleasant dark fruit notes but really comes out a little warmer with some nice caramel notes and more robust fruits. The body has a nice weight, not heavy or thin and a smooth finish.

6 Smak delikatnie alkoholowy, bardzo przyjemny, goryczka wyraÅºna, rÃ³wnieÅ¼ sympatyczna. W smaku dominujÄ Åliwki i przyprawy. Z czasem alkohol staje siÄ bardziej intensywny, nie odrzuca. CaÅoÅÄ bardzo dobrze skomponowana, piwo rewelacyjnie pijalne. Bardzo polecam.

1 Chestnut brown in color with lots of carbonation problems throughout the body.  There's no head whatsoever.  The aroma is very subdued but I detect dark Belgian candy sugar and sweet dark malt.  The flavor much more aggressive than the nose implies.  There is a large concentration of dark Belgian candy sugarand sweet,dark malt. Belgian yeast gives it a tart acidic red wine edge.  The mouth is warm with alcohol and moderately carbonated.

1 An excellent ale, powerful at ten and a half percent, but smooth and drinkable. A little bit of boozy heat, but the flavors are layered and complex. I got some dark fruits, like plum and cherry, along with caramel and a yummy bready base. Lots to like here.

1 Overall it is not a bad winter warmer, smell was a little much for me, but other than that above average, would be interesting to taste this aged for five years or so

5 A bit more of a bitter bite when compared to something like Local 2. Still a very serviceable Belgian style ale. (Borderline 4? My expectations were high.)

6 Very good dark fruit and roasted flavors with some black licorice, but it had a slightly metallic taste but it could have just been because it was on cask.

5 Pours dark with a bubbly head almost like champagne. Smells like honey, citrus and apple. Tastes is citrusy but not over the top. Very refreshing and light, could drink this beer all day.
6                                The aroma reads like a champagne. Honey is subtle but somehow also the dominant note. Citrus adds a bit of acid to what otherwise reads like a sweet dubbel.

5 Golden tinge and opaque. Earthy malt, slight farmhouse, roots. Slight anise finish. Another great one

4 Medium bodied. Gotta sip this one. Pretty decent carbonation.

This is a win-win-win situation.

3                                                                                    Pours out an almost still amber body with practically no head.  Smells of caramel malts, booze, and brown sugar.  Tastes of sweet caramel, dried fruits, and warming alcohol.  Full body, subtle carbonation.  Slightly numbing on the tongue.  A solid holiday beer.
4 Overall: To sum it up in three words: pretty bloody good. I've had a few Belgian festive ales but this leads the pack by a country mile. Punches well above its weight in the ABV stakes, of course, but it has the flavour and mouthfeel to pull it off magnificently. Came as part of a case of 15 'random' beers and I'm glad it did. Excellent beer.

2 An expensive, rich, and complex brew. At an 18% ABV and a $10.00 a bottle price, you'll want to savor every sip. Enjoyed from the 12 oz. bottle, it is best just slightly warmer than refrigerator temperature to get full benefit. Obviously extraordinary, well worth the investment.

6 Flavor is a bit dulled, in comparison. Caramel malt dominates. Peach skin, pear, and tart apple accent, but fade to toasted nuts in the lightly dry and fairly hot finish.

2 Enjoyed but found it a little light bodied compared to similar beers in this style.

2 The taste is very good with nice complexity from the yeast adding some dark cherry and slight spice flavors iwth gentle malt sweetness with a mostly dry tangy yeast flavor in the finish. Overall I was glad I got to try this - a very tasty strong belgian ale.

High marks for the beer's ability to subdue any hints of burn with a great balance of flavors from cherries to cinnamon to bready malt. A seasonal treat that could be enjoyed all year.

4 This is the 3rd time of had it.  This time I taste the cherry - big, right up front.  I love cherries, but this is a bit much.  Strong  and full flavored. Syrupy sweet, and alcoholic.  A bit overpowering, and a challenge to drink.  I'm not looking for a beer to challenge me very often.  I don't think I'll look for again.  Not terrible, I don't hate it.

An absolute one and done beer. How they have 11% in such a sweet tasting beer is beyond me. Best for Holidays

5 Pours a dark, murky, medium brown producing 2+ fingers of moderately lasting, tan, frothy head that leaves nice strings & rings of lacing. Aroma pumpernickel, dark fruits, roast, molasses, faint cocoa & floral hop tones. Taste is similar but more robust with cherry, coriander, hints of anise, cloves & more cocoa than in the nose. Finishes very peppery/spicy with a chocolate cherry cordial, molasses, coriander aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, silky/creamy but with a light spice bite in the finish.

4 Overall a solid good beer.  It wasn't what I initially expected, but perhaps that's part of its charm.  Not for someone who's not used to a little sourness in a dark aged ale, this is a beer for Belgian lovers to sip, dissect, and enjoy.

6 On tap at Jolly Pumpkin Ann Arbor poured into tulip. Dark brown appearance with a finger of off white head that leaves spots inside the glass. Aroma is funky, sour, cherries, and wood. Taste is similar with almost no sweetness. Medium bodied, active carbonation, drying and crisp.

3 Sour Brettanomyces driven first impression, coated up by bready, soft malts. Also ripe, fruity orange, which goes well with the sourness. Then dry, noble hops hit the palate, which give the beer a well balanced, decent complexity. Sweet molasse becomes detectable for a glance, which soon gets swallowed by the hoppy sourness. This actually reminds me of Orval in some way, but adds a very well fitting fruit note to the beer, while it isnât very aggressive on the hops. Leads to a bitter finish, very dry aftertaste, which dries up the mouth completely.

I prefer other Mikkeller efforts in this style space. Was appreciated by my friends who would generally shy away from anything too funky. I might taste this again down the road to see if the present assessment holds up.

2 Color is amber/bronze and a bit cloudy. Huge white head with an amber accent. Smells like a sour beer, only a bit sweeter. A combination of different tastes, such as caramel, candied fruit and spices, gives for an incredible beer. Delicious.

1 I am drinking a canned version and upon popping the tab, faint bitter hops support large pitted fruit on the nose. It pours hazy gold under a very pillowy head that persists and leaves thick lace all the way down. The palate starts with fruit balancing a line between peach and apricot with citrus, very faint grapefruit, orange, bread and light grains in the background and traces of caramel. The bitter on the finish suggests earthy grapefruit rind. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium high. While the beer is very creamy, the canned version tastes artificially carbonated opposed the the natural carbonation in the bomber bottles and the dcanned versions carbonation feels a little harsher â not as smooth as the bottle conditioned variety.

1 Good for the style.  Aging fairly slowly (had this one in the cellar 2+ years - drink-by date 6/15 on label)

2 Fruit and malt on the nose. Pours brilliant orange tinted amber with a vigorous, long lasting, 3â white rocky foam cap. A fruity palate starts with orange, peach, and a hint of banana, spice, light caramel, a touch of bread, pepper and a light bitterness on the finish. Medium body and medium high carbonation. A delight to drink.

4 O: My biggest complaint, way too much carbonation, I'm not sure if the tart funk bitterness is a regular flavor in this style but it seems to not be, no bottle date, so it may be old. I would love to know the bottle date or try one fresh. It starts well but doesn't finish well.

However, it is smooth, somewhat complex, and easy to drink.  It may not be at the top of the list of Trappist ales, but you could do far, far worse than this brew.
2 Smells as rich as it looks, with some leather, prune, and strong raisin scent on it.  Taste follows the same path, with a mild bready flavor on top.  Goes down nice and smooth with a small, yet soft and fluffy head.  Not a ton of complexity, but certainly delivers where it's needed.  Nothing to complain about with this Dutch take on the Trappist.

1 A bit too funky for me.  Nothing works, lots of rough edges.  Not smooth.  Rough around the edges.

1 Finishes with an outstanding malt supported bitterness, which occupies the tongue for quite a time.

5 Overall:  Like this beer, but definitely not my favorite Belgium strong (pale or dark).  Too sweet and little too much alcohol burn.

4 Pours a very hazy orange body, musty white grape flavor with dry cork. Very nice Belgian ale.

4 Overall: 8% is totally hidden.  I can see why they named this after the devil.  Despite my appreciation for how representative it appears to be of the style, this is not my style.  I like phenols in whisky, not so much in beer. (I took note to leave the sediment in the bottle - had a bad experience with that once before, learned by lesson).

Good restaurants should have this beer and if they do, order it.

3 Favorite of the style. Comparable to Duvel, but slightly better in taste-not as carbonated, coriander is subtle but evident.

1 Pours a golden amber with a small head - and I poured it cellar temp (about 60 degrees).  Drinkable.  .
2                      My bottle has a different label and says abv is 6.9%,,none the less a decent brew,

1 Overall- A pretty good beer but it is not a beer that people will want to drink on a regular basis.  it is definitely one that beer-fanatics will want to try.

3    lot of light lemony and peppery notes, little alcohol thru the nose, really clean

6 Delicious golden Belgian tripel. Mildly lemony on the finish but not citrusy either.

3 Beautiful slightly milky yellow. Thin small head. Nice tight knit lace left on glass I am not getting much hop aroma -some is there but nothing like a dry hopped American pale ale. Hop aroma balances well with malt aroma and fruit background. Light sour smells also. It all blends together well. Contrasting broad flavor palette. Hop bitterness definitively present. Fruit, light citrus, yeast tastes. Reminds me somewhat of a good American champagne re  yeast, acid, fruit balance. Bret character is well balanced. smooth mouthfeel. After swallowing I'm left with bitterness on the sides of my tongue, minor sourness, and the smooth mouthfeel. Very interesting beer. Opening  up as it warms. Others have said tart - yes that's it, not sour but tart.

Spices remind me of a nice chai tea, really really pleasant. Wish the price point was more reasonable.

The follow-on scent is a mildly sour, funky  aroma that is distinct from the usual Strong Pale Ale presence.  Flavor is very good. The fruit malt and yeast up front are strong, slightly sweet and very tasty. The sourness and funk are  fairly mild, but an interesting change of pace from the standard BSPA flavor. The  transition is seamless and the funk in no way diminishes  the traditional flavor.  Mouthfeel is rich, alcohol presence is minimal, and the variety off flavors is just right on the tongue.  An excellent brew!!!!!

2 Food match: Ibuprofen, Panadol and Aspirin - pick your poison. Or cheese platter.

1 It's not bad but just doesn't come and grab me like the rest of the Dupont family.  It's also a little bit hot in feel and flavor strangely, and seems to hint more towards saison character, so I'd prefer the others if that's the direction for me.

5 An interesting yet rather dulling beer. By that, I mean that the mild astringency, bitterness, and over-bearing dryness makes this rather flat and one-dimensional. Drinkable? Sure. Big booze buzz? Check. Memorable and wanting you to drink more? Not quite. Fair enough for what it is, but nothing to get really excited about.

1 This one was just out there for me. Maybe an adventurous person would like it, but it just didnât work for me.

1 Decent, but not the best of the style.  Worth trying for the intense herb lovers.

3                           Very spicy when cold but improved a lot as it warmed up

5 Most of RR's brews are amazing, this one just seemed to fall short of the standards so highly set by the others I've had before it.

Bright in the glass, bright on your tongue, bright on the palate, and bright in the finish. Its got a great round mouthfeel, with a sweet yet bitter flavor. well done.

6 Let me first say that my rating is biased by nostalgia for the first time I had Ozzy, the predecessor the Beazly, in Baltimore, MD. I was at a fantastic bar and was interested in the local brews and choose the Ozzy based solely on the type of beer it was. My expectations were normal, for a beer enthusiast that is. It was poured for me out of a can.  I was surprised by how good it was! Since then, I made a trip to Brewer's Art in Baltimore and enjoyed the beer again on tap in their marvelous cellar atmosphere. It felt very right. The beer is exquisite. Even now that Ozzy has been rebranded as Beazly, the look, smell, taste, feel and might I mention nostalgia remain the same. It is a great belgian style pale ale and always a refreshing delight to enjoy. I highly recommend. Do not be turned off by its container - a can is more environmentally sound, protects it better from UV, and when poured into a glass does not take away from the experience. Overall: it is a fantastic beer.

3 O: Very mellow and well integrated flavors. Subtle overall but fairly complex. I got something new with every sip.

Refreshing tartness and dry mouthfeel. A grade new world Berliner. Nothing too special.

I might have to pick some of these up for the summer if they aren't too expensive. Overall a splendid example of the style. Should go well if you prefer to add a dash of himbeer or waldmeister syrup.

5 O- a bit of an underwhelming sour, especially at this rice point. One dimensional towards the tartness with only the mild breakfast cereal character giving any complexity. Could definitely stand some increased esters or funk. That said, it's an easy drinker and the six pack shouldn't last long as the days get warmer.

5 Normally, I'm not a fan of sour or fruit beers.  My husband ordered this at a local gastro pub and decided he didn't like it.  As someone who hates to see beer go to waste, I decided to finish it up for him.  Surprisingly, I actually liked this beer quite a bit.  Open the first taste, you get a bit of dry sourness but then it turns into a round, juicy flavor that I rather enjoyed.  I might need to rethink sour beers now.

6 Aroma of citrus zest, mango, peach, apricot, faint honey & green tea. Taste stone fruit, mild earthiness, shape citrus finish. Nice!

3 Still, brewing a Berliner Weiss takes a few special steps which require skilled hands - obviously Jack's Abby is more than adept. For reasons entirely unclear to me, the style has yet to catch on and sightings can be few and far between. As result, it's become a sort of sacred treat I reserve for those days so sunny you're happy just to be alive. And indeed this one fit the bill.

4 Verdict: A very nice Berliner Weissbier from de Garde, easy to see how it serves as a great base for all the fruited variants. On it's own though, it's refreshing and simple, very crushable, would make for a great summer stand by.

1 Pours a pale hazy gold with a white head.  Smells like green apples, lemon zest, and hay.  Taste is funky and tart.  Mouthfeel is dry and refreshing, fairly crisp, although slightly undercardbed for the style.

2 Verdict: A nice berliner from Bend Brewing, perhaps a bit too sour for my tastes, but the hibiscus is showcased well, decently balanced, but I'd like to see a bit more pomegranate in this. All in all, this is quite a refreshing and enjoyable beer, definitely would be a go to if I was local for summer sessions.

3                                                      Overall - This is ok.  Well made, but the cherry is the highlight and it isn't that fantastic.
4        Just the right amount of sourness mixed with a touch of delicious cherry.  Not too sweet with a nice amount of carbonation.  Very refreshing
5 As with all of these from Schell's I enjoy them.   The base flavors seem amazingly consistent and fortunately I enjoy them.  Glad these are around.

5                 Tart Citrus Berliner Style - could knock back a 6er of this on a summer day easily
6 O: TART: would be more refreshing on a hot summer day than with the 3 feet of snow I'm staring at;

4 O- Overall this is a nice berliner.  I'm surprised by the dryness of the body.  It gives the impression of a sour champagne.  The brett and the yeast are definitely more present in the nose than in the flavor and mouthfeel.  This is a nice sour-but its pretty simple rather than complex.  I'm definately looking for more wheat characteristics in a berliner too.

1 Scored a six pack of bombers from a friend that aged them for 2+ years (drink by date of 9/12) because he didn't like them but didn't want to throw them away...needless to say, this beer has aged very well!!!

3 I'm a fan of sours and this beer is SOUR.  Very lemony, light, and drinkable at 4.0., this beer really delivers.  A perfect summer sipper.

1 Straw color with a quickly fading white foam. Smells of peaches and wheat. The taste is just okay. I was hoping for a bit more peach flavor but you do taste subtle fruitiness upfront. Very well carbonated but the mouthfeel is lacking. I liked the second beer more than the first but I wouldn't buy this beer again.

A great beer for a summer afternoon sitting in a garden.

4 Poured a clear, golden hue with a small amount of white head (not to style as I understand, perhaps a bit more carbonation would be nice). Hint of lactic sourness on the nose, not much else. not a strong aroma. Lactic sourness on the palate right up front, some hints of white grape, and some bright lemon notes. Crisp and tangy. Effervescent with a nice, dry finish. Nice beer. One of my first Berliner-style beers. I am sure that there are some whoppers out there, but this was a nice taste of the style for a good price. Berliner-style might be making it to the homebrew queue.

2 Wow, just wow. Eisenbahn Lust Prestige kicks the shit out of DeuS, and it's well worth trying at least once. However, you'll need to come to Brazil to purchase a bottle for yourself, and if you can find it, you'll be spending at least R$80 (or US $50) for a bottle.

5                                                          D - Could use more spritz and dryness for the style, but good if you take it as a malt liquor. Still, it's overpriced at $11.99 relative to some superior offerings that are available for a tenth of the price.
6 O: Very strange example of the style as there is so little carbonation (which is not what I have observed with others in the style or would have expected). Not super easy to drink due the sweetness - definitely not sessionable for me. Alcohol is pretty well hidden.
