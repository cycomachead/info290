4.76,18.7,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.5,"Very good flavor.  Light and fruity like others have said.  I didnt taste any banana.  Very drinkable with no alcohol taste,  but with 12% abv it sneaks up on you pretty quick. At $7.99 a bottle its a great deal.","Kiserian","Mar 15, 2015"

4.2,4.7,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured into a Gavroche tulip. Pours a medium to dark bronze amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of apple and pear, overripe tropical fruit, apricot, bready and candi malt, white wine. Flavor is similar mixed fruit, dominated by light and dark stone fruit, fig, banana, clove, bready and caramel malt, finishes with bready, almost rye grain with residual semi-sweet mixed fruit and light caramel; light hop bitterness. Medium to heavy bodied with pleasant creaminess. This is a nice domestic take on a quad, rich and complex. The hops were a bit of a surprise, but this is a half-year old bottle and they may have faded a bit, which is fine, because their presence, like some of the other flavors, is deftly integrated into the whole. Very nice. Victory seems to be poorly distributed to Washington now, and I was lucky to pick up this bottle from a store I know handles beer well. Glad I got the last bottle. If I see it again, I will cellar some, this has potential for a few years of interesting change.","LiquidAmber","Mar 03, 2015"

This might not be as complex as some of the big Belgians, but still quite enjoyable.  I poured it into my St. Bernardus goblet.   Nice opaque dark straw color. Felt great on the tongue. Light on the carbonation. Not as much alcohol burn as one would expect from a 12% ABV. Overall, very impressive. I already picked up two more bombers","RobPete","0"

The alcohol was present, but not what I expected out of a 12.  For the price ($7.99 here), this Quad is absolutely going to become one of my favorites.  Worth a try, if you're a fan of this style.","Bisco42","Dec 30, 2014"

4.32,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/13/2014. Pours slightly cloudy orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, black pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, black pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, black pepper, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance, robustness, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible quadrupel style! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 02, 2014"

This is a phenomenal take on the style.  It has a great caramel earthiness up front, a slight hop twang on the finish, and just enough alcohol warmth going down to remind you to be careful.  And just enough awesomeness to make you want to throw caution to the wind.  Which advice will win out?  Only the rest of the evening will tell.","roblowther","Sep 08, 2014"

I cannot detect any aroma whatsoever, but at least it doesn’t smell bad.   In terms of flavor only the sweetness of candi sugar is noticeable – no caramel, no figs, no dates, no raisins, no alcohol – just sweet.  No hops, no malt, no diacetyl.  The palate is decent.  I last had this beer in 2008 and can’t see where it’s changed.  Whatever I paid for this bomber was too much for a beer that’s “meh” at best.","Ozzylizard","Sep 02, 2014"

The aroma is very fruity, with pineapple and apricot being dominant. I also quite strongly pick up what I perceive to be citrusy hops here. The taste is actually more balanced than the aroma suggests, with Belgian yeast and lots of candied fruit esters mingling with one another. The finish leaves a 'syrupy' taste in my mouth, which is borderline too much. Overall, I think this Belgian Inspired Ale is good, but can benefit a lot by resting it for a year or more.","Neorebel","Aug 01, 2013"

Belgian yeast provides lovely carbonation, but there just isn't quite enough body for me here. also the teeth rotting sugar finish is even more than the style calls for. this is an absolute must share bottle of beer, even with one friend we struggled with the last of it. a quality quad, especially if you like yours sweeter and stronger than the standard issue.","StonedTrippin","Mar 18, 2013"

Rummy fruits into a warming finish. Post-banana bitterness spreads, peppered by the peppery, spicy alcohol. Yeasty too. Full-bodied, with a subdued, smooth, bottle-conditioned feel.

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Bottled on December 29, 2011 indicated on the bottle. Pours a dull, burnt orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity. Head is half an inch, off-white and frothy. Nose expresses overripe figs, caramel notes and a spicy character. Taste follows nose; however, candi sugar is also present, as well as a fermented quality to the dark fruit. Finish expresses a hint of ethanol. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation that falls just short of lively and a slightly crisp finish. Overall, I have to say that this beer seems closer to a Tripel in character than a Quad. There's definitely an alcohol presence, but it's extremely well-hidden at 12%. I think this beer might be worth cellaring for another year or two to see how it opens up.","Jwale73","Nov 03, 2012"

Warm sweet smell of (no kidding) nitrous oxide and slight booziness. At least when I was a kid this is what nitrous oxide smelled like when I was getting teeth pulled. Not sure if it actually has a smell or not. What a grand and warm taste this delicacy has. Flavor is warm and inviting with caramel tops and a cherry-ish reminiscence, or maybe sweet southern barbecue that rolls around the edge of the back half of your tongue on finish. The booziness enhances this lovely combination. The just-above-non-existent carbonation makes this fine sipping brew whose complex flavors beg for sipping and resipping. Hard to call $13 for a bomber snooty, but this is dang fine ale. Note to self: buy whenever you can.","PHSCAPT","Sep 22, 2012"

This one's only 10 months old. Drat. Wish I had aged it, because this wants more complexity. Doesn't really seem like a quad, but that could be because my quad experience is limited to the abt style.

2.41,-39.9,3.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 6. It pours a clear copper topped by a frothy couple o' fingers of dusty cream-whiteness. The nose comprises light melon, tart orange, lemon zest, light white grape, a touch of pine needle, light honey, and there's a vague notion of Brett-like funkiness in there as well. The taste holds notes of rich caramel, pine resin, some sense of menthol, honey, and something akin to thick, spicy wine grapes (imagine a nice PX sherry made with chardonnay grapes or something...). It's like an overt combination of sweet and piny, with neither side knowing when to back off, always escalating and exacerbating every possible circumstance. If the world were run like this, it would consist of literal dust caught in the threads of the cosmic tapestry. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, a syrupy feel, and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, I thought this was a pretty sad excuse for a quad, one that laughed in the face of a usually tasty style, making everyone involved feel all the worse for the experience.","TMoney2591","Dec 23, 2011"

Similar in the taste, sweet malts, candi sugar and brown sugar, raisins and figs, yeasty, woody, with an obvious alcohol sensation.

Nose is complex: Syrupy sweet with cloves and spice, raisins, pepper, syrupy malt, and hints of alcohol. Smells delicious. Tastes very sweet out front, with a bit of alcohol burn. Definitely malt heavy, which masks alcohol though there’s a definite burn at the finish. Hops are hidden but come out a bit at the end. Mouth is nicely viscous, very smooth, with consistency of thin syrup. Overall: his beer seems to just be “too big” and probably would benefit from aging. Definitely big and flavorful, though could use some moderation.","jettjon","Jun 06, 2011"

Nose is as said plus a little fig, fresh nutmeats, tree bark. Flavor is similar to aroma, but mainly dominated by the caramel malt with a little bitterness in the background.

Taste: sugary black plum flesh, peppery, spicy hopping, slight plum skin tartness, soft pear. Alcohol via the peppery component, but more more in control here than the nose.

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"D - This was a much more enjoyable beer than I remember it being from my last tasting; a pleasant surprise which I suspect may owe much to the fact that this bottle was just a bit over a year old when I popped the cork. The yeast character is still quite spicy with an almost, but crucially not quite, overwhelming note of clove. There are other subtle complexities in the yeast profile, such as pear and lemon, but aside from clove the other dominant flavor characteristic is anise. These are both yeast flavors that I consider desirable in a golden colored belgian ale (which V-12 more or less qualifies as), but they are a bit too strong for my taste in this brew. Still, they are much more subtle than I remember them being from my last sample and they have moved back just enough to allow other flavors to show through. Rich, thick and syrupy malt is abundantly present throughout with a nice honey and biscuit richness that reminds me of Victory's German style lagers. This malt would be cloyingly intense in almost any other beer, but here it is just what is necessary to balance the powerful yeast and huge alcohol content. Overall, this is a surprisingly drinkable and well balanced beer, though the alcohol level seems to be bordering a bit on novelty levels and I'm not convinced that it wouldn't be a better beer at 10%.","nickfl","Beers"

Sweetness in there as well as caramel malt and hints of chocolate are evident. Touches of tropical and dark fruit are also evident although just barely.

Some lingering alcohol heat, but it is rather muted overall after almost 6 years in the bottle. The taste takes a back seat to the complex nose, but it is also not to be passed by either.

Both, in my opinion fall short of what it should for the style and as a beer but then again, I'm biased to overly hopped beers especially when the style just isnt meant for this level of IBU. In my opinion, there is too much refined sugar used to get up the IBU which should be reduced slightly and presented more in other adjunct or malt for complexity. It is a very straight forward malt profile built on light malts. I dont mind the 'hotness' that comes through on the tongue which may be offputting to others. This is really a malty imperial tripel if there was such a thing and falls short of many in the style. However; I'd rather have this over any IPA. If you like an over hopped American Belgian that packs a lot of punch this is the beer for you. It doesnt have the complexity or balance to rival the most complex category of beer on the planet.","lifeboyq","Mar 14, 2010"

The initial fruit flavors described above are muted and brief passing listlessly towards the aforementioned dry hay finish. Less rich and lighter bodied, too. The carbonation is full in all its Belgianesque beauty, but the liquid seems slightly thinner than I would have hoped. The alcohol is hidden in a drying finish, but the warming effect on the throat cannot be dismissed. This doesn't play out as a traditional quad, but is a good beer nonetheless.

4.08,1.7,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,""Victory". Seemed to be the proper beer for cheering the Americans to victory in the Olympics. The beer pours with a bright ruby hue, abundance of carbonation with great staying power, lacing, and legging. Beers just don't look any better than this. Aside from being a bit light (Dubbel-like), the beer is ideal. Aromas of cotton candy, confectionate sugars, rich fruits, rum-like alcohols, and a surprisingly large amount of pine and floral hops. The balance in the nose is of the candied fruits, alcohols, and hops. Flavors of sweet confectionate sugar, cherries, berries, apples, figs, dates, grapes, apples and pears make for a sweetly balanced brew. A burst of perfumy, floral, herbal, and pine hops fight hard to balance the sweetness and nearly dominate at times. The taste of alcohol with the hops compete too much to appreciate the delicacy of the beer. Textures are more sweet-syrupy than malty. Heat and abrassion from the alcohol-hop blend prove too much to be the drinkable beer that it wants to be. Finishes sticky sweet, dry, and with a lingering floral note. Age will surely be kind to this beer.","BEERchitect","Aug 11, 2008"

There is also a sweet honey characteristic in the aroma, probably a result of the alcohol. Taste is juicy full of fruit such as those mentioned above. Starts off very fruity and ends on a slight dry note. Either way, it is bursting at the seams with fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is heavy, but not necessarily viscous or syrupy, more slick I would say. Carbonation is just right on this one in that it is apparent, but below the sweet alcohol, balancing everything out nicely. This is an exceptional example of an American made Quadruple.

A bready smell is there as well as some sweetness. The taste is super smooth, which is especially nice given the 12% abv. It is winey, bready, and has a long malt sweetness.

The alcohol was very evident in fact and hurt the drinkability slightly. Mouthfeel was medium-full in the palate. The beer finishes with a good bit of peppery spices in the back of the throat.

The taste was a bit harsh, like rocket fuel harsh, too hot for me, and I like big beers. I really feel the alcohol really drowned out any of the subtle flavors that were there, just really overwhelmed it. The feel was good, smooth, not thin or watery and not too heavy.

Flavor of this beer is very complex. The taste has a buttery alcohol flavor to it. Spiced orange peels tickle the tounge as well. As this beer warms, a caramel apple flavor seems to appear along with a tiny bit of smokey pepper. Carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit rough, lots of continuous bubbles.

It is quite fruity on the palate, with pear, honeydew, melon rind, banana?, and green/yellow apples. In addition, there are phenols, a touch of cork, and light hops that impart a mild bitterness. Toward the end it becomes a touch too sweet, but quite nice on the whole. It is lightly drying with a medium body and a champagne-esque effervescence, leaving a medium finish.

The yeast didn't seem to fully do it's job, plus the brewer just went balls to the wall with gravity and as a result the beer is sweet, overtly alcoholic and a bit messy around the edges.

More carbonation feel than I had expected based on zero head. 12% alcohol - sure couldn't tell. This was very, very easy drinking. Not a dark tasting as Chimay, but really incredibly good.

Smells of bread, sticky sweet pale malt, the alcohol is subdued in the smell for a 12 abv. The taste is a lot like the scent, sweet sticky malt, slight apply bitterness, the alcohol is a bit more present in the flavor than the sent. The mouth feel is soft and round, but the alcohol and slight bitterness of the hops give the beer quite a bit more weight. To me this is not a quad in any way other than it's strength.

Pours a dark rusty orangish/amber color with a MASSIVE head of foam (pour this one slowly, folks) . Aroma is fruity, sugary, and candy sweet. Taste is reminiscient of sweet hard apple cider, with some maltiness and a definite alcohol bitterness. This is obviously one potent brew! Has a sparkly, bubbly medium mothfeel to it with alcohol burn on the swallow. Great beer, a little strong on the alcohol prescense, but maybe that's a good thing, since you'll know from the first taste that is one is to be sipped and savored slowly and respectfully. I've been wanting to try this for a long time and now that I read that it's being discontinued, i'll have to grab another couple of bombers to save for a special occasion.

I made a big mistake in ignoring the food pairing recommendations, but I really had to try the V-12. I found its character clashed very harshly with my dinner (a bruschetta pizza). The beer actually became very difficult to drink toward the bottom. This is not just a mistake I made however that tainted the rating, its flavor is too overpowering to be paired with almost any food. By itself, it does make a decent desert beer.

3.85,-4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"March 29, 2005 bottling...extremely charged bottle (at least it didn't gush), huge head of two inches of delicate mousse-like foam on a careful pour. Oxidized nectarine color, tons of rushing bubbles inside the glass. Wide by relatively sparse laces. Nice aroma, spiced apricots, stewed prunes, a bit of a honey quality. Body is about medium, carbonation is sprightly and effervescent. The flavor is too tinged with alcohol, some underlying senses of the apricot of the aroma, bitter orange extract, and slightly scouring hops help -- but the finish is quite bitter and overly hot at the back. Frankly, this one is a bit too much, the nice aroma and generous carbonation are what makes it decently balanced as an overall drink, but it does wind out its carbonation in about half an hour. Maybe this might age to a mellower product.","ADR","Jul 07, 2005"

Hey, its Victory V-12 and I looked forward to cracking this one  but it is not the huge classic brew I was led to believe it was. I also always thought that this would be one to age, but I guess from what I just tasted and witnessed it isnt. Cost $7.99, and given the distance from the source and strength it is not that expensive, but Im not sure I would pop the greenbacks for one of these again. Not bad, but certainly not the great brew many told me it was, it lacks complexity and definition, in fact its a little rough around the edges and worse it suffers from poor carbonation and that annoying orange syrup ending. Drink it fresh once bottled and drink it quickly once poured would be my advice.","TheLongBeachBum","Jun 28, 2005"

The nose gave off notes of cherries and melon. The drawback for me was the mouthfeel, which was simply way too hot. It also had a nice creaminess to it, but the heat and intensity of the alcohol made it difficult to really tatse much. I tried, believe me, and I will try again, but I think that this is a beer that could do with some maturation time.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2005"

Complex, lots to note. Fruit after the malt, sweetness at the end, almost sugery, but not in a bad way. This beverage got better as I drank it, and I don't think it was because it got me drunk. Dcent if not great carbonation, belieing the absence of head, this continued to stimulate after swallowing.

4.17,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a transparent burgundyish auburn color. Tons and tons of bubbles sit afloat with a small layer of foam on top. Minimal lacing. Aroma is boozy at first then becomes sweeter and fruitier then ultimately becomes drier with a little sting in there. I'm reminded of the peanut butter and strawberry jam sandwich I had an hour earlier every time I take a whiff. Taste gives me more malty sweetness but hardly any residual sugars. More just of a nice fruity flavor along with a sweet liquer taste. Alcohol esters are there but controlled marvelously. Hops are basically not providing any bitterness but I think they're holding the sweetness back and giving more of a dry fruity flavor and I thank them for giving this beer balance. But the main base flavor is a yeasty sweetness. I don't really know how to describe it but the yeast gives a depth nicely and a little spice. It could still use a little more body and viscosity and maybe more complexity. Finish lingers and lingers. Belly warming. Quite well made and quite enjoyable.","granger10","Jun 11, 2005"

No real viscosity to the deep, pure copper-colored liquid. Smells okay--not too special--like slightly sour apple skins and a vaguely white-winey grapeyness. Cordial notes come through in the finish, like brandy and lemon. The nosefeel is thin, vinous, and cutting with alcohol's cold heat. At first the flavors strike me as being simple. Like, "hm... fruit." And then, just as I'm about to stop paying attention, "fruit" becomes "dried apples, mandarin oranges, raisins..." Fruit, and overflowing baskets of it. Every flavor, from black cherry to banana, is soaked in layers of alcohol and medicine, warming to become bitter like honeyed herbal tea. Fantastically dry mouthfeel, alcoholically thin and warm, evaporates into the tongue but leaves the tastes behind to be savored. Points go to the drinkability just for the sheer polish of it all. Drink with care. After the first half of the bottle I was feeling pretty good. After the second half, I wasn't feeling much of anything at all. Great stuff.

Taste is wonderful---a big creamy malty flavor dominates There is a surprising light hops presence, along with expected cloves, sweet fruits, and alchohol. This is a thick full bodied beer with a medium/light level of carbonation that works just fine.

The nose is raisiney and spicey, with an underlying caramel and brown sugar sweetness and a wisp of alcohol playing underneath it all. Not too shabby. The flavor is pretty nice. I get a rum-soaked raisins, brown sugar sweetness, spiceyness and alcohol that play very well together. I even get a touch of orange citrusyness in there.

No lace was left on the glass. Aroma was a light fruitiness mixed with sweet malts and a touch of spice. Unfortunately the alcohol was very evident in the aroma and came to dominate as it warmed. Sweet malt, a light spiciness and ripe fruits seem to be battling with the huge alcohol here in the taste. At first the strong alcohol was noticeable but as it warmed the alcohol makes this one pretty hard to finish. It didnt seem like it was an off bottle, just that the alcohol was way to dominate. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I would expect with a big warmth due to the alcohol. Drinkability was ok but hindered by the alcohol. I will probably give this one another chance in the future.","meathookjones","Dec 30, 2004"

Well, if this doesn't warm you up on a cold winter's night, you may well be cold-blooded. Malty, sweet and thick; chockful of fruity esters and alcohol notes, undercurrents of clove, cocoa and sulfites. Warming and numbing to the esophagus. A year and a half in the cellar has mellowed the carbonation pretty good. I remembered it being a little too spritzy for the style. It's better in the warmer stages of the beer, and the brewers at Victory recommend decanting carefully as to leave the yeast behind. Good job guys!","crookedhalo","Dec 05, 2004"

Sweet candy tones and yeast dominate the profile....and nicely so. Raisin, fig and rum soaked cedar come into play as well. The heat from this 12% bad boy is really held in check on the palate and interplays nicely with everything else that is going on. I'm catching some fruits as well: melon (maybe watermelon), cantelope, etc. The mouthfeel is close to silk. The beer kind of melts away in the mouth like cotton candy. Superb.

Black licorice with notions of candied almonds and marzipan upfront in aroma, along with persistent hot, solvent twanged fusels. Mellows slightly and deepens in complexity as it breathes, with ginger snap and dark toffee hints arising. Enticing, but noticeably alcoholic aromawise. In flavor, perceived incipiently is an nutty, but boozy impression of bourbon soaked brittle and whiskey macerated dried dates. Subtleties surface after a deliberation as the beer oxidizes. These include hints of herbal, clove themed phenols, bubblegum esters and ripe fig undertones, all wrapped in an ethanol laden, middling quality liquor blanket. Distinct malt and / or sugar derived character is subdued, with deep, but integral dark caramel notes provided by both caramalt and perhaps dark candi sugar. Moderate in body, with a viscosity that is both ethanol and dextrin induced. Surprisingly, the carbonation level is perfect. Usually a gushing bottle is noticeably overcarbed. Finishes with a searing ethanol snap yielding to drying, albeit slightly astringent bitterness. Quite the intense brew, and is overtly boozy even after over a year of cellaring. Certainly not short on flavor. Tasty, but brambly.","marc77","May 18, 2004"

The aroma is very complex, each time I take a whiff, and I smell something different. The first aroma is a mild and sweet yeast bread followed by a hint of citrus fruit. Upon the second smell, I picked up a mixture of caramel and candied yams. All of the aromas were intermixed with a perfect medley of alcohol and sweet malt. Upon first tasting the alcohol makes its presence well known, theres nothing subtle about it, its extremely warming as it flows down my esophagus into my belly. The follow-on flavors were a very nice balance of spicy coriander sweet toasted malts, and just a hint of brown sugar. The mouthfeel is very nice. Its very well balanced.

The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh hops, pine needles, wood, lots of fruit (apples, pears, sugar coated berries), sweet malt, warming alcohol, yeast, candy sugar, and a hint of spices (pepper, fresh cilantro). Moderately sweet aroma mixed with a warming alcohol made the aroma a very good experience. I liked this beer already, and didn’t even take a sip as of yet. As I took my first sip I noticed sweet malts and sugars first as it eased into the other flavors that were all warmed by the warmth of alcohol. Flavors of sweet fruit (berries, apples, some citrus tones), fresh hops, some floral hops, spices (fresh cilantro, pepper –white and green), pine, some barrel wood (aging barrel - bourbon), and yeast all blended very well together. Medium bodied. Good balance of flavors. Complex and easy to drink, I was surprised d/t the alcohol content and the age. I rather enjoyed the sweet qualities of this beer though.

Remarkably sweet upfront and bitter hops are undetectable, which is no surprise. I believe the hops are there and lend to a smooth finish and somewhat cut the cloying sweetness. The nice fruity characteristics found in the nose are found in force in the flavor. Not bad. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy with small carbonation.

The body is firmly medium with a very fine carbonation that tingles the tongue before becoming creamy in the mouth. Smooth and malty! The flavor delivers a very rich, sweet, and fruity (both light and dark) malt that's well-balanced by underlying bitterness and yeasty spiciness. Some alcohol is clearly present, but it's not overbearing and should mellow with some cellaring. Rich! Supple! Excellent! 6 months of aging will do wonders for this beer. Absolutely worth seeking out. Buy it now and put it away for special occassions! It should be quite nice in time for Thanksgiving, and will make an excellent after-dinner drink shared with good friends!","NeroFiddled","0"
