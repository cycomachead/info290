The texture in particular is sinful in its decadence. The idea of a more-ish quad is a dangerous notion, but that's what we have here. Every sip is a delight to the senses.","ryan1788a5","Feb 27, 2015"

This is a beer for having one of and savoring over an evening, and yet with it being so tasty I found I finished it rather quickly.  The alcohol is dangerously well hidden, and I'm glad I knew this was 11% when I ordered the 25cl glass otherwise I think I would be in trouble later.  I will have to find this beer again.

Smell: toasted brown bread, molasses, cooked apple and cinnamon, pepper, herbal, plum skin and earth. Fairly traditional but a bit different in an odd but not bad way. Taste: sugary dates, plum skin, burnt sugar, tiny cherry and cola notes, herbal and mildly earthy. Sugary and full bodied with light and creamy carbonation, finishing sticky and earthy.

Tastes as the smell suggested it would. Unfortunately that burnt quality comes across  even stronger on the tongue. It doesn't dominate the flavor profile, I tasted sugary dark fruits aplenty, but it is impossible to ignore. It lingers along with some vaguely medicinal alcoholic heat. This falls far short of the best examples of the style. Too many readily available great quads out there, I should have passed on this one.","DIM","Dec 14, 2014"

The aroma is a good mix of typical Belgian yeast and orange along with a touch of sugar and and breadiness, with possible caramel and breadiness as well. Medium-bodied with a very slight sticky touch, the beer has a sharp carbonation and peppery spice edge that adds balance and gives a crisp finish (vanilla?). The taste is moderately sweet, with some candi sugar like malt along with toffee or caramel or bitter cocoa and a chewey breadiness, as well as having some fruit flavors beyond citric/orange like touches of dark fruit like figs or black cherry. A textbook quad with great balance and a mix of fruit and sweet flavors that is a quality example of the style that hides the alcohol well.","clayrock81","Jun 30, 2013"

While there was just a hint of vanilla that lingered after everything else slowly faded away, there's so much to like here that any Quad or even Belgian beer fan deserves to give this a go, for that matter.

Nice thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, pepper, light clove, cocoa, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy ester notes. Taste of raisin, prune, apple, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, cocoa, pepper, light clove, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, cocoa, light roast, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible flavor balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Quadrupel!

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Sold at around 11 dollars at the Giant Eagle Market District in Robinson. I love the De Halve Maan Brewery logo, big bottle 750 ml or 25.4 oz here. Pours a Deep russet, nearly opaque ruby tinted cola brown body...the head layers with a deep khaki tan head fomring large bands of Belgian style lacing with each sip. Aroma has a hint of cherry with apple/figs and other dark ripend fruits let's throw in raisins as well. Hint of alcohol tickles the nares with a heavily malt laiden mild dark roasted edge to it. Each sniff you take, you get more of a vinous character that really builds the backbone of the experience that this quadruple ale offers. Flavor wise this beer is drinking nicely, I'm excited to try other Straffe Hendrik offerings based on this big bodied Belgian beauty. Toasted dark malts brings on some mild bitterness but layers of complex malt also bring on layered fruit between dark plum tartness, deep sweetness of plump raisins burst, with an accent of tannins found in your favorite tea or big bodied red wine. More sweeetness than I can typically handle in a big bodied ale like this but I'm a sucker for well balanced big ass Belgian bier. Mouthfeel is still considered a bit effervescent even with loads of malts it doesn't seem the least bit cloying on my palate. Which is an amazing feat that true Belgian ales always seem to pull off with ease, it's hard to believe this is 11 percent abv, probably more hidden booze than any big American craft brewer will offer excecute. An artform the label states this is Bruges last standing brasserie or at least one of them. Mouthfeel is full bodied but carried so well with some lively carbonation it's pretty amazing. Overall exomplexity and flavor combined this is one of the better quads I've had in some time, a different style than my normal beer consumption is really a welcomed addition and revisit to beers I've tried in the past but either haven't had access to or just haven't desired since I've pretty much devoted myself to craft beer (typically hoppier offerings).","Stinkypuss","Jun 21, 2011"
3.47,-16.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown, off white head forms and fades. Aroma of nutty, toasted malt, sweet dark fruits and doughy bread. In the flavor, raisen, fig, toasted almond and caramel. Smooth on the palate and the alcohol is only barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, clean enough finish and semi dry at that. Overall, a very solid quad with great traditional flavor. Without a doubt this is one worth revisiting.","wvsabbath","Jun 16, 2011"
4.08,-1.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall - This is solid, but not a top of the list quad. It almost comes closer to a strong ale then a quad. The dark fruits, roasted malts, it would be hard to guess this as a quad. Pretty good but there are a few other quads that smoke this beer. If you are looking for a different twist on the style, this would be a nice sample.","AmericanGothic","Jun 13, 2011"
4.38,5.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: A pretty good beer. Not my favorite example of the style, mostly held back by the dryness of the flavor. But, really not bad, definitely worth a try.","brugge2004","Beers"
2.71,-34.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,"poured out a good frothy head that disapated slowly leaving moderate lacing. the aroma of roasted malts and dark fruit dominate the nose.Peronally I like this one altough my preference leans toward strong blonds and tripels but this could change my mind on that. alcohol well hidden not overly sweet high carbonation definitely worth a try ,I bought a second bottle after to cellar .","adamette","0"
4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I rather like this brew as it's quite unique. If you're expecting the big dark fruit and leather thing that you get from Gouden Carolus or La Trappe's dark brews, you will be surprised. Gets big points for a unique interpretation of the "Quad."","SFLpunk","Jun 04, 2011"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish in color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet alcohol, nutty, and some dark fruit. In the taste, sweet nuttiness, alcohol, and a mixture of raisin and figs. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with and dry dark fruitiness, especially raisin in the aftertaste. Dry and nutty, with a nice presence of dark fruit.","OWSLEY069","May 28, 2011"
3.8,-8.2,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Bottle shared at the May Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a dark cola color with a poofy tan head. Aromas of yeasty brown bread, candi sugar, vanilla, alcohol. Flavors of dark and red fruits with coriander, fruitcake, raisin, vanilla, licorice, and booze. A bit too hot and perfumey on the palate at 11 percent.","illidurit","May 27, 2011"

3.53,-14.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sweetness hampers this beer a bit. Finished a bit twangy and sugary. Booze thins it out. Character is a puzzle","Mebuzzard","Apr 25, 2011"
2.71,-34.5,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O/D - Not a big fan. An OK Quad but not what I look for. Too much spice and yeast and I could never have a full bottle of this.","tbeckett","Apr 22, 2011"
2.98,-28,4,3.5,3,2,2.5,"O - As referenced earlier, this beer tastes, smells and feels like a Tripel. Way off the mark for the style, and not great regardless of style consideration.","ktrillionaire","Apr 09, 2011"
4.11,-0.7,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Not my favorite Belgian quad but a nice break from the rochefort and saint bernardus I so thoroughly enjoy. The lace is truly spectacular on this guy.","Patrickbrusil","Feb 25, 2011"
4.13,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The alcolhol is well hidden and overall i have to say that this one is a very drinkable quad. I would like to see how this beer is when you age it a few years, it can only get better.","Brabander","Nov 05, 2010"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"It's a good drinkable beer. the 11% is not a big problem. It's covered well enough.","RuudJH","Beers"
3.98,-3.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"A good quad overall, and must be some special offer since I didn't even see this at the brewery.","BucBasil","0"
