Taste is similar to the smell with fruit, sugar and roasted notes but has a hoppy finish.  Mouthful is heavier with no carbonation.  A nice American quad but their are better choices out available.","Slack","Mar 25, 2015"

It leaves a warm burn in the stomach and a sweet taste on the tongue, if this is to be your first foray into quad territory better go with St. Bernardus Abt. 12 instead, there really is no good place to start with this kind of beer so that is as good as any. this is good beer and an interesting beer, take time to enjoy it and the experience will be better for you.","JackRWatkins","Jan 26, 2015"

3.1,-21.9,3.75,2.5,3,4.25,3.25,"Final Word: Unfortunately, the strong alcohol presence got in the way of the other flavors in this beer, and made the experience feel lopsided. While the black liquorice, spice, dark fruit, dark sugar and chocolate flavors could have created a nuanced drink, they felt as if they were crushed and compacted under the weight of the alcohol flavor. Had they been allowed to bloom and expand, this beer would have been very complex and satisfying, but instead it felt like every sip was dominated by booze. It was as if each sip had a 50/50 blend of alcohol flavor and ONE random flavor contained within the beer. You’d get a hint of raisin in one sip, but get only black liquorice in the next, and the flavors never seemed to mingle. The potential here was great, but the experience felt like a missed opportunity. Still some good flavors in here, but the profile is much too alcoholic for the subtle flavors within, even for a Quad.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 17, 2014"

4.34,9.3,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Excellent Abbey style quad from Sierra Nevada. Pours a dark roasted brown with a tannish brown off white head that gives a Guinness cascade when poured with a slowly dissipating head that leaves a thin tight beaded head that lightly clings to the glass. Smell of chocolate, dark plums, tart cherry, and astringent grains. Taste is of dark berries, cherries, raisins, plums and dark malt rounded by Belgian candy sugar. Aftertaste is pleasant with dark chocolate and dark fruits and a slight herbal note, yeast flavor is hard to find with everything else going on, which is a LOT----especially as it warms. Silky smooth mouthfeel and VERY deceptive of the alcohol. Another APLUS from Sierra Nevada brewing, a favorite I have had many times in bottle, but could not pass up the chance to have on draft. As a side note, I noticed a different head and more subtle flavors from tap than bottle....for what it's worth. Try it! Cheers.","Brutaltruth","Jun 16, 2014"

Smell is booze, fruity sweetness & moderate yeast. Taste is decent fruitiness up front (from the plums?) with yeast esters. Pleasantly sweet. Finish yields more yeast esters along with slight bitterness. It isn't as complex as your ideal quads but I think the plums add another level of sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, somewhat creamy but also slightly on the thin side. Overall I like it. It isn't the best quad ever but it's got enough yeast and the plums add some fruitiness that make it interesting.","foobula","Jun 13, 2014"

I absolutely loved the artwork on the label and the cork on top is such a great touch! The Beer itself has a thick dark appearance with a tan, fizzy head when poured. Nothing crazy but still looks satisfying and has a wonderful smell. The first inhale I took I was hit by a rich chocolaty scent with a slight undertone of plum finishing out with a smooth hint of sourness. Leading into my first taste I was definitely hit by the bold fruit flavor and velvety smooth finish. It was rich and round with hints of fig, chocolate and spice. I loved this beer!

The taste is very good and gets even better and smoother as it warms, take your time and enjoy sipping on this one. Overall it gets bonus points for both value, $15 a four pack I believe, and for the ABV which does not come on strong.

4.08,2.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"I usually reserve my St. Bernardus chalice, gifted to me during my only visit to Brawley's in Charlotte, NC, several years ago for special treats, of which I am hoping the Ovila Abbey Quad is one. Opens up with a light pop, as the cork is freed from the wire cage and extracted. The carbonation is light, and the beer pours very dark brown, looking like a thick cola. The smell is filled with cherry, plum, and other dark skinned fruit. There is a touch of hops upon deeper inspection of the smell. The taste has more of a brown sugar, than a dark fruit type sweetness, with sour notes becoming more noticeable mid palette, before being swept aside by the alcohol warmth. Some dark chocolate presence in the finish. If I have a fault to pick, it is the thinness of the body. It does not quite seem up to the velvet like feel of others in the style. I like the Ovila Quad for what it is, but I think the Ovila Saison is better.","rajendra82","May 18, 2014"

Aroma deep dark fruits of course with the plums added the tart ripened fruit holds over other notes. Flavor dark fruit again the plums are added to bring out raisin tart dark fruit with alcoholic notes more and more big fruit flavors with each sip this stuff is excellent, Belgian style with the higher carbonation it carries it all very well. Each sip brings out chocolate malt with high end spectrum dark fruits a mixture of dry and sweet malts add to the balance. This is a big calorie big flavored beer mouthfeel is medium to full even flowing carbonation residual sugars lie down for me. Overall it's a big beer meant to be enjoyed by the masses.","WVbeergeek","0"

I really like what Sierra Nevada is doing with these Ovila beers, both with the beers themselves and the backstory of helping the local monks with their abbey and perhaps eventual brewing. This particular beer definitely has gotten a bit plummier after a some months in the bottle, either from the fruit itself getting a bit more prominent, or the other constituent flavors mellowing a bit. Lots of juicy fruit on a fairly soft frame of malt and spice and a bit of tannin to help reign it in. The finish is long and has a touch of sweetness and then a long spice note.

Pours hazy nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, plum, prune, banana, clove, pepper, toast, dark bread, molasses, candi sugar, light chocolate, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, plum, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, plum, banana, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, molasses, candi sugar, light chocolate, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, toast, dark bread, clove, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy esters; with good plum flavor presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice quadrupel style. All around good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and plum flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 16, 2013"

It tastes like plums, bready malt, cloves, toffee, and some bananas, chocolate, and a slight medicinal taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good brew overall, but with that being said it's not one of the best Quads I've tried.

Left a thin skin on top and has alcohol legs. Nose is really sweet and I’m immediately turned off. Big heavy malt, sugar, molasses and dough. Plums, more dark fruit sweetness and the subtlest of hop floral and spice underneath. Alcohol is peeking out. As it warms it opens up vinous and with some leather and tobacco . Taste is sweet and then some. Sugar, heavy and cloying. Plums are lost to the sugary sweetness and to the taste of prune. The malt is underplayed and could have used more roast, more toast, more depth and some biscuit. There was no hop presence to balance the sweetness and it was thick and syrupy. Yeast tries to offer up spice but is devoured by sugar. One dimensional. As it warmed it developed a bitterness from the alcohol. Without much carbonation the alcohol is fully on the palate and this hits the stomach like a big sweet donut. I could live without it.","utopiajane","Jun 09, 2013"

Aroma has a roasted character, raisin bread pudding is a good descriptor, malts and dried fruit blended in a complementary way. Appearance is a dark brown-red with decent lacing and lingering residue of foam on top. Taste is a dried fruit lineup of plums, figs & raisins, very smooth despite the high abv, chocolate(?), orange zest. The main theme I picked up is that it’s all really well integrated. The wide array of roasted, citrus and dried fruit flavors work together. Palate is lively, sizzling in carbonation, medium bodied, long lasting flavor presence. Overall, this stuff is a good deal for the money and one of the few Belgian-style beers I’ve had in recent memory that’s highly recommendable.","brian60625","Apr 17, 2013"

Subdued aroma of dark fruit; particularly plums, grape juice, sweet malt. Flavor follows aroma with dark fruit, grapes, bready malt, the fresh plum flavor is remarkable. Of all that times I've used plums as a flavor ingredient in beer, this is the first time I got such a fresh, first bite plum flavor. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A bit reserved in flavor for a quad, but enough to well cover the ABV, and refreshing in the fresh plum component. I hope I can pick up another bottle of this.","LiquidAmber","Apr 11, 2013"

Beer has a rich nose of plums, molasses and a little cherry. Also some earthy notes, but those don't stand out much. Flavor is very sweet, even for a quad. I think the plums move the sweetness to the next level, and it's a little overwhelming. I taste high acidity, which hurts the balance of the beer. Flavors of tasted oats, smoke, tree bark, sweet berries, and of course plums. The body is nice and typical of the style. A little high on the carbonation. Overall, I like the beer.

4.01,1,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"It has some really nice flavors of dark grains, chocolate and dark fruit. The fruitiness is kept at a good level; it does not overpower the malt. The bready aspect is just a touch too much on the 'burnt' side, like a loaf of the brown bread from Outback that got left in the oven a bit long. Alcohol is well integrating and lacks the usual 'sting' of some beers this high in ABV. Mouthfeel is fine-bubbled and not quite chewy but full enough not to be a problem, carbonation a touch on the low side. It’s a pretty good quad; I’m glad I bought a 4-pack of this and look forward to seeing what this does over the next couple years.","twiggamortis420","0"

4.09,3,4.5,4.25,4,4,4,"Sierra Nevada collaborated with monks of the Abbey of New Clairvaux. The quad features sugar plums grown on the Abbey grounds and harvested by the monks. The beer pours a deep, rich brown with ruby highlights and is nearly opaque. A decent khaki colored head diminishes slowly, but is well retained. The nose is rich with malty flavors. Hints of the dark fruits are aided by the addition of the sugar plums, and a bit of molasses, toffee, and spices round out the complex aroma. The dark fruits are pronounced on the palate, with dark cherries, plums, and figs all playing a role. Toffee, caramel, and molasses flavors are contributed by the bold maltiness, while a touch of booze and slight Belgian funk carry across the tongue. Silky smooth, Ovila is fairly heavy in body with a moderate level of carbonation.","phishsihq","Feb 22, 2013"

I'm not a real big fan of Belgian yeast flavor most of the time but it seems like the sugar plum used in this one helps this beer lean toward a much evolved flavor. I would purchase it again, even at $6 a bottle.","brock146","Feb 17, 2013"

But boy was this a treat and did it's job. One of the best american made belgian style ales I've ever had. It's a shame this is probably the only time it'll be offered bc it's worthy of a seasonal release. The quality of dark fruit and plum flavors are spot on and overall this quad is very tasty. Grab it if you can.","BradtheGreat7","Feb 17, 2013"
3.99,0.5,4,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,"Pours dark brown - sort of a maroon-tinted mahogany - but light enough for color to be seen throughout and the beer is transparent even in a full (small) glass. Head is thin layer of fine beige bubbles. The aroma has lots of sweet malt and dark fruit notes. Lots of raisins, prunes, plums and other fruitiness. If I didn't know there were plums added, I probably would think this is just a normal quad with particularly deep fruit notes. It smells like a raisin bread pudding. Lots of doughy, bready malt with caramel, molasses, treacle and sweet booze. Very nice spice, as well. Taste starts sweet and builds in complexity and spice. The fruit comes through with a bit of tannic bitterness. Makes me think of macerated plum skin. Most of the sweetness is caramel and other doughy, toasty malt notes. The finish is a bit boozy, but there's a lot of nice lingering flavor. The mouthfeel is fine and gentle. It does get a tad sticky as the beer warms and some of the carbonation comes out of the beer. Hard to avoid that. Still, it coats the mouth nicely and that light bitter note keeps the beer from getting cloying. Overall, I'm impressed by this beer. With their fancier offerings, Sierra Nevada shows off a mastery of restraint. When it comes to adding fruit (and barrel-aging), breweries tend to go overboard. This beer uses plums to enhance its flavor, and the beer, rather than the plums, remains the star of the show.","popery","Feb 17, 2013"
3.74,-5.8,4.25,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: I have never had the standard Ovila Quad, but this version is good despite the lingering cloying sweetness. Better than the Ovila Dubbel and Saison, but still not top notch. I am not sure why Sierra Nevada can't nail these traditional Belgian styles - usually the mouthfeel seems to be the issue. But damn this is a good smelling beer.","bsp77","Feb 16, 2013"

3.99,0.5,3.75,4,4,4,4,"This poured out as a deep brown color, almost black. The head was thin and cream colored. The retention is thin and the lacing is scattered. The smell of the beer is bready and sweet with a subtle touch of chocolate malt in there as well. The taste of the beer is sweet with some chocolate and herbal spice flavors. There is some fruity elements in there as well. The mouthfeel is a smooth with a pretty solid carbonation and medium body. Overall it's a good brew, not sure what I'm supposed to taste from the plum that were added but either way it's a pretty solid Quad.","Knapp85","Feb 16, 2013"

3.59,-9.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"O – This is a decent beer. Unfortunately for it, it’s the quad category, which immediately puts it at a disadvantage (some of the best beers in the world are in this style). Every aspect of the beer minus the appearance is lacking in some aspect – the aroma and taste lack the complexity of good quads and each have evidence of phenols, the flavor is a bit cloying, and the mouthfeel is lacking in that wonderful characteristic Belgian creaminess. Regardless of all of these things, I appreciate the collaboration and originality of brewing the beer with plums. It’s also pretty tasty (albeit lacking for the style) and very drinkable for 10.2% ABV. All-in-all, it’s a decent beer, and I’m glad I tried it.","BlackBelt5112203","Feb 13, 2013"

An espresso crema cap just hangs on through the finish. Nose brings belgian yeast, bran and buckwheat, dark fruity esters and milkshake malt.
