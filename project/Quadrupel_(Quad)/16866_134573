4.38,7.4,4,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,"      This is a top tier Quad. Period. It drinks like something this strong has no right to. It's delicious. It's complex and satisfying.

4.21,3.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured into a The Bruery tulip. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transmission and a half finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma rich in dark dried and fresh fruit; dates, figs, raisins and plums with sweet candi malt, mildly earthy. Flavor follows, dominated by dates, fresh and dried figs, plums and raisins. Lightly bready, sweet malt. Flavor progresses from dried fruit to brighter fresh fruit notes before leaving a lingering brown sugar and dark fruit aftertaste with a hint of tartness. Medium bodied. A very nicely made, flavorful Belgian, although I found the profile to be closer to a Belgian dark strong ale than a classic quadrupel, although the clove and Belgian spices are faint or absent.  No matter, there is a lot to taste here. Rich and satisfying. ABV is covered well. This may be one of my favorites from the series. A great choice for Christmas.","LiquidAmber","Dec 25, 2014"

Taste is slick and oily initially and when cold but gathers some traction with warming and exposure, yeilding more Belgian yeast character and some more subtle complexities.  Feel is expected given the nose and taste, that being a bit sweet and viscous with moderate complexity.  Overall a bit one sided and somewhat limited in nature though will likely improve with a couple years of quiet time.  Personally prefer Quads a bit drier but this doesn't disappoint either.","HalfFull","Dec 17, 2014"

This is an excellent strong dark belgian ale-very smooth for the strength with excellent malt flavor and such sweetness without becoming cloying I love a strong ale like this with such rich taste and complexity.","Slatetank","Dec 14, 2014"
