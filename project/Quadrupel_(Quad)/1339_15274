4.15,2.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I employed a very gentle pour as lees were visible in the bottom of the bottle. This resulted in a dearth of head, but a very clean, deep-amber liquid with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a dried, dark-fruitiness to it, like prunes, raisins and figs, very apropos for this time of the year. There was also a yeast-driven mustiness and a definite alcohol burn noticeable on the nose. Mouthfeel was medium and my first thought was "Brown Sugar!" thanks to it s massive malt presence on the tongue. Phew! Next, I got some real heat from the alcohol and once that passed, the fruity esters really asserted themselves. Warming, the fruitiness became even more prevalent and so did the heat. The finish was extremely dry, thanks to the yeast really having done its job. I would bet that there was not much in the way of fermentable sugars when all was said and done. My my my.

4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a ruddy amber color into my Belgian glass, with a 1" off white, foamy head. Some haziness. Great lacing as the beer went down. The nose of this one is very citrusy, with tangerine, lemon, and sweet grapefruit notes to it. When drank, a huge malt flavor dominates, with sweet candy, apple, dark fruits (raisin and fig), molasses, and cherries. Very yeasty as well with only a slight spiciness. The ABV is warming, yet perceived as not too boozy. It's full bodied and it coats the palate very well. Overall, I would say this is very tasty and enjoyable, but not on the same tier as say the St. Bernadeus Abt 12 or Rochefort. Could use some more balanced complexity as this is primarily just very sweet and fruitier than the other quads I have had.","Neorebel","May 10, 2012"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, fruit, spices, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, dark chocolate, bread, wood, and vanilla. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation which gave it an almost creamy texture. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. To be honest, there were quite a few notes that I was not expecting in this one. The vanilla note was definitely the biggest surprise to me. Granted it did add a nice touch to the other flavors there, but it just felt a little lackluster overall to me. While good, it just felt a little off to be labeled as a good brew. Worth trying if you get the chance, but that is about it.","thagr81us","Apr 09, 2012"
4.3,6.4,4,4,4.5,5,4,"11.2 ounce bottle into chalice; bottle code K08E8. Pours super clody reddish brown color with a small 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass; with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big molasses, caramel, dark candi sugar, pepper, fig, raisin, toffee, and light yeast spices. Big malty aromas here with a good amount of complexity. Taste of big caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, prune, dark candi sugar, pepper, roasted nut, biscuit, and light yeast spices. Lingering notes of molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and roasted nut on the finish for a while. Great flavor balance with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Very smooth to drink but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is an outstanding quad. Big flavor, complexity, and balance. Very smooth and highly enjoyable to sip on.","superspak","Mar 28, 2012"

The booze is more than apparent, though somewhat appropriate for a Quad. Going to sip for a bit to see if it changes at all. Served around 50º, it's not making a good impression.

There are other reviews here with excellent details of the aroma & taste though. If you enjoy wines, the complexity & richness of the tastes reminded me of the first time I had Jarvis Cabernet Sauvignon, but at about 1/10th the price.

Creamy tan head displays great retention and leaves films of sticky lacing. Aroma is diacetyl and caramel. And that's it. Flavor is very similar. Old butterscotch and caramel make this a very sweet beer. There is also a whisper of dark fruitiness and alcohol. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and sticky from the sweetness.

This creates an interesting smell that I have not quite experienced before. Big and edgy malts fill the palate. The alcohol heat is present. I like to know it's there, so that's cool with me. Apples, white grapes and pears mix in well with some sour candy while a very inconspicuous hoppiness lurks in the background. Carbonation is quick, huge and excellent. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied. Drinkability is as expected in a beer of this magnitude. That is, it makes you respect it's complexity. All that being said, there is something about this beer that doesn't totally suit what I'm looking for in a quadrupel.

The alcohol is there, so if you're drinking a 750 by yourself you'll be feeling it a little before you finish it. But it is a lot easier to drink then a lot of quad's that there are. However, what is interesting about this beer is that I can't foresee a lot, if any, people falling in love with this beer. It's a little tart for quad lovers, a little too dry-sour for flemish sour lovers; I can imagine people who love Geuze's might find this acceptable, but that's a really low in alcohol style, so the alcohol might get to them.

Poured a deep, almost brown, amber color. A solid inch of thick, bubbly off-white head rose up from the glass. Awesome head retention on this beer, thanks to the very active carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Tons of thick, clingy lace was left behind on the glass. Smell was of plums, dark cherries, a touch of wood, Belgian yeast, candi sugar, and a touch of alcohol. Very fruity. Flavor was again plum, semi-sour dark cherries, some sweet malts, sweet candi sugar, and some faint yeasty notes. Finishes rather smooth, with some alcohol heat felt in the back of the throat. Tons of carbonation felt as well. A nice full bodied mouthfeel, that was somewhat thick and palate coating. Pretty good drinkability, just becareful, the big ABV will sneak up on you.

Ever since then, I've been trying to get my hands on (no, not her although Hildegard is a sight for sore eyes) her Hop It creation, but I have yet to find a store in my area that carries it in the 1 plus pint bottle. While my search continues for that precious gem, I came across this accomplishment and what an accomplishment it is. This quad with the funny name was popped from a corked bottle and instantly got me pumped to experience its flavor. Lots of fruit, particularly strawberries and sweet fruit in general, but not in an overpowering way. And this is not to suggest this headed into lambic country...quite the opposite. It pours into my Duvel tulip glass with a deep copper color and a white head that settles quite nicely. Lace draped the glass throughout the entire experience. A very abundant aroma, again strawberries and sweet fruit gushed from my deep glass. And lots of candied sugar in the aroma too, which introduced itself in the initial taste. Again, not overpowering, but the sweetness balances so perfectly with the slightly boozy finish and the silky smooth mouthfeel. I think "balanced" best describes this quad. It's sweet pleasant flavor makes this a highly drinkable treat, in fact one of the best I've ever had. Although there is some alcohol in the finish and at 11.5% abv, it's a whopper of a brew which will give you a nice buzz, the alcohol is quite subtle. Drink it with a roaring fire in the hearth and a block of room temperature Cabot's Seriously Sharp Cheddar cheese. It simply doesn't get much better than that.","jim102864","Feb 04, 2007"

Much lighter than I expected for a quadrupel, which is I assume the style based on the description "quadrium ale". OK, so also I cheated by reading the style listed here, but let's not nitpick. Smells of caramel, bubblegum, sour oranges and a hint of something oaky. Also not what I expected of the style but nothing I don't like yet. Taste? I think I'm doing the dog getting scratched in the right place leg twitch. Oranges, cocoa, lemons, a dry finish that just brings the malty start to a perfect balance. The mouthfeel is silky and oily, not really chewy at all. Again, surprises me for its style. Drinkability probably goes without saying given the review so far. No real alcohol burn a bit of warmth, so no problems there. The balanced flavor will make this whole bottle go down rather easily. In short, find this one...and fast!","roblowther","Jan 28, 2007"

The nose is yeasty, darkly fruity, raisiny, caramel, and has hints of coffee. The taste is very sweet throughout, with many of the above characteristics joining in, plus a lovely cinnamon flavor. The alcohol is hidden very well, and only shows itself when the sips are too closely spaced. Perhaps it adds a bit of a peppery taste, too.

3.6,-10.9,3,3,3.5,4,4.5,"The draft pours a deep golden amber color, with moderate haze and small whitish head, which lingers around leaving a delicate, sugary lace. Very strong aroma appears to be a gridlocked battle between caramel/sugar, fresh, bitter hops, sweet, fruity esters, and alcohol. The discreetness of the aromas was my first indication the quad might be bit unbalanced, and a few sips quickly confirmed that tastes of these aromas were indeed not well blended, albeit a bit more complex then the nose had lead me to expect. The hops, accentuated by the apparent hardness of the water, ultimately dominated the finish of this beer, which is rather unusual for the style but indicative of the brewery's willingness to experiment. There was also a very pleasant tartness from the yeast in addition to the sour apple, grape and citrus esters. Although the body was rather syrupy, the generous use of sugar drys out and balances the richness of the sweet malt, with notes of caramel, honey, toast, rum and raisins. There is a lot to the mouthfeel, but it would have done better had the overall taste profile been smoother. This quad is fairly drinkable, as it's relatively digestible in spite of such high gravity, making for a robust tasting beer that goes down easy and masks it's high ABV very well. Still, the recipe could use some tweaking, and additionally, the beer tasted a bit young. Bottle conditioned I'm sure it would smooth out nicely with age, but the fresh keg I tasted had clearly not fully matured. The Urthel is certainly worth trying for those that tend to gravitate to the more 'extreme' beers, but purists (and light-weights!) might want to steer clear.","ccrida","Jun 01, 2006"

Clear copper with a thin ivory lacing, surprisingly no yeast in the bottle. Tiny bubbles constantly cascade from the bottom of my Duvel glass, keeping the lacing intact. Spicy, slightly smoky aroma blends with bubblegum and apple cider. Taste is rather one-dimensional; the hops are ever present at the start, but nothing seems to follow but the warming alcohol finish. Highly acidic and quite dry in the finish as well. My stomach is warm. The alcohol is present both in warmth and quickness to the skull. Watch out for this one. Though I believe any beer is worth trying once, this is not one worth seeking out in my opinion. If you can find this, you can certainly find better Belgian examples of the style.","IrishRedRock","Beers"

Candyish, but also fruity (apple?), with a definite herbal hop bitterness. Sweet, candy malt flavors up front. Sugary fruits and grain that trend toward trippel-like. Some pepper in there too. Big sweetness demands and receives ample bitterness. Dries out the sweetness with some acidic, herbal bitterness. Finish is warming and nice. Full-bodied, with a thick feel. Not too syrupy though.

The beer pours a golden amber color with a thick head that stays around. The nose is light raisin and tons a spiceys. The flavor is much more intense than the nose would tell. Lots of good raisin followed by a good dose of alcohol, finishing with a really big blast of spiceyness. The feel is right at moderate, smooth and slightly creamy.

Alcohol is not particularly apparent, but that mouthful of sugar could hide just about anything. Mouthfeel and drinkability both quashed by the sweetness, which for me, even for a quadrupel, seemed over-the-top.

Of course, the proper glass made cream colored head about 10 ft tall (ok, more like 2-3 inches). Anyway, the presentation brought it all back on what lept out at me on the intitial sample I had at bones (before I ruined my pallet with another brew): Powdered cinnamon and yeast in the aroma. The beer had an orange amber glow to it. I found it full bodied, with more cinnamon spice in the taste. Yeatiness is apparent, although the alcohol sneaks in at end (at 12%, how could it not). Tasty.
