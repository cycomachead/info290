3.99,1.3,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Unlike other bourbon-barrel aged beers, Blasphemy never becomes too "booze-y."  This is still definitely rooted in the Belgian Quadrupel style, with the aging merely adding just a bit of heresy  (if you'll pardon the pun.)  A very nice example of a strong-style beer from a brewery that seems to be making such ales their trademark.","m_hall","Mar 03, 2015"

It enters with sticky sugar and a little oily growing quickly to big fruity alcohol flavors, sherry, bourbon and a little alcohol heat on the finish. A big, balsy, full bodied beer with average carbonation.","pat61","Jan 23, 2015"

I found this completely delicious and very enjoyable, and certainly holds its own against BBQ, 5 Monks, or Not the Stoic. Not in my personal top tier of BA offerings only because it's a bit one-dimensional, but for the style, it ticks all the boxes, and does so with some panache.","neurobot01","Dec 17, 2014"

The more I contemplate, if a Manhattan and a Belgian Dark Ale produced offspring, Blasphemy would be the result. Weyerbacher knows big beers and their barrel-aging program is sadly overlooked with Blasphemy topping the list. What's more, the value for a beer of this magnitude is ~$8/bottle and cannot think of a better BBA beer for that value. Now, if they Barrel-Aged Tiny and Merry Monks as well, I just may not seek out another brewery. (5.0)","threeviews","Dec 11, 2014"

Smells like nearly straight neat whiskey booze and not much else here, maybe some extra sweetness from the malts. Flavor is a bit harsh with sweet candi sugar, light spices, some caramel, vanilla, and lots of straight phenolic booziness.

4.2,6.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/9/2013. Pours moderately cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, fig, apple, pear, plum, clove, pepper, oak, caramel, candi sugar, toffee, bourbon, molasses, light vanilla, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, apple, plum, raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, pepper, candi sugar, molasses, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, pepper, candi sugar, brown bread, herbal and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark malt, and bourbon barrel flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a slick and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barrel aged Quadrupel style. All around great complexity and balance of malt, yeast ester, and barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable sipper.","superspak","Nov 27, 2013"

The booziness that detracts from the taste and smell is airy and pungent on the tongue. I'm glad I've got a few more of these for this winter and next winter.

They mingle well with the Belgian yeasty flavors ones would expect from a quadruple. This is perfect harmony, the hops keep the sweet bourbon flavors in check while the malt is all smooth and graceful. Alcohol is a little strong on the nose but it's well hidden on the tongue.

Aroma is malt, sherry, dark ripe fruit, with a little oak and vanilla. Flavor's much like nose with sweet front and center, tapered with some bitter and a tiny bit of tang. Body is good, full and round, true to style, but carbonation is a little soft. Finish is like flavor, lingering, and has no off characteristics although the alcohol give only the barest hint of the power.

Aroma is very nice, it smells like dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, sweet apples and some brandy. The taste is pretty much like the aroma, the brew tastes like dark fruit (raisins, plums, figs), caramel, bourbon, vanilla, oak, booze and candy sugar. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and thick with low carbonation. I think this is a good beer overall.

3.19,-19,2.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Weyerbacher Blasphemy pours hazy, and is somewhere between brown and maroon. There are very nice light red highlights shining through. The bone colored head is barely there, fades quickly, and doesn't leave a stitch of lacing. A disappointment all around, although I do have to cut the beer just a little slack on this count due to the prodigious alcohol level. The barrel aging is readily apparent in he aroma. Notes of caramel and vanilla immediately jump out, before fading in with some dark berry and fruit smells. The nose is balanced in equal measure by a spicy phenolic character and a warming bourbon and boozy note, which could stand to be a little more subdued. The flavor works off that blueprint, but dials up the alcoholic heat and bourbon even a bit more The plum and raisin flavors up front don't seem as dark and intense as they normally are. The peppery phenols are there, but largely drowned out by the hot alcohol aspect of the beer. The body is somewhat full (though also somewhat dried out for a 12% beer) and nicely creamy. It's aided by an expansive, yet subdued carbonation. I had high expectations for Blasphemy, as I think Belgian style beers do better in bourbon barrels than a lot of brewers realize, and I think Weyerbacher does some great barrel aging (Heresy, and especially Insanity). This one though, was definitely a bit underwhelming. I chalk it up more to the base beer than the barrel aging.","axeman9182","Oct 28, 2011"

Highly carbonated and lots of warming alcohol, viscous and challenging to push through quickly, not a session brew for me. These flavors aren't my wheelhouse, somewhat clove in the Belgian tradition, conducive to food to help cut the sharp acidic attack of this aggressive ale.

If you can get past the alcohol, there is a nice Quad underneath there, but God help you if you can find it. Full and complex on the mouthfeel.

Almost like a very sweet barleywine. Tastes like plum, fig maybe, dark cherry, all the awesome dark fruits, backed by sweet malts. True belgian in style and implementation. Almost like a belgian dark ale, except lighter in body, but a lot of the same tastes are there. Strong, full mouthfeel, flavorful and coating whilst being refreshing at the same time. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit because of the booziness, but that's only a slight hit. This is my favorite Weyerbacher so far, definitely worth seeking out.

Smell is dominated by oak and a lot of spice--I'm even getting nutmeg and cinnamon in there. Vaguely like a winter warmer. Some citrus notes in there as well. Alcohol present. Taste is really surprising, kind of aggressive on the sour cherry side, actually, especially for a quad. Alcohol is very noticeable, I have to admit. It's good, but it's quite a lot to handle. The usual chorus members show up in the taste as well: vanilla, oak, brown sugar, etc. Very thick body, moderate to high carbonation.

The mouthfeel, besides being medium-to-full, was really HOT! This beer seems to cry out to be aged. This is what I have deemed a "Now 'n' Later beer" after the children's candy that advised "Have some now, and save some for later." I might have to see about procuring another bottle for cellaring purposes. After the initial heat died down, I tasted a lot of dried fruit - raisins, prunes, even banana along with the sweet caramel and vanilla that I noted on the nose.

Make sure you're not going anywhere for a while; this is one of few beers I would recommend sharing your bomber with a friend.

I'm usually quick to fault Weyerbacher beers for having a samey, boozy, house yeast taste, but after aging this for a year, it rises above that stereotype for me.

3.2,-18.8,4,4,3,3,2.5,"Copped a 22oz bomber from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Really nice logo sticker with a monk covering his mouth with his hand... Blasphemy... According to the label, this beer is the result of aging Weyerbacher's Quad in Oak Barrels - the final product is an excessively sweet, slightly overbearing oak-aged taste with vanilla and strong caramel aftertones... pours a very nice dark-copper color with minimal head and impressive carbonation... Smell is replete with a malty, sweet, sugar-laden aroma... taste is ultra-flavorul, very rich and thick with a strong syrup taste pouring through...Strong alcoholic presence is noticeable in the tongue and nose, but is not entirely dominating, although the ABV is certainly up there at 11.8% ABV... as with many Weyerbacher brews, this one wasn't bad, but was slightly over-the-top, powerful, and should be sipped slowly... Overall, a flavorful, interesting brew... Worth a try...","dsa7783","Dec 22, 2007"

In my notes, it reads (and I quote): "Holy crap OAK!!" So, you get where I'm going with this. In addition to blow-your-head-off oak aromas and flavours, there are some quite complex undertones of butter, vanilla, and mild fall fruits, which make this more drinkable than some of its oak-aged brethren. Pretty tough to hide 12% ABV, but they do a decent job of trying. Probably one of my favourite Weyerbacher big beers so far.","crwills","0"

The green banana flavor comes out even more in the flavor, along with the super sweet plum-like malt. The mouth feel is really sweet and almost cloying. Full-bodied that finishes with a slight dryness and a little bitter. Overall, the oak barrel phenomenon is over taking beers.

It's quite difficult to put this one away, which is strange, because I've not had trouble with other high ABV beers (Dark Lord, Bell's Batch 7000, Rochefort 10).

It is close in flavor profile to some of the finer rums I've had the privilege of experiencing in my life. The sweetness of the barley with the bourbon risiduals is tantalizing and should age with grace. Other reviews of this beer view it as a last ditch effort to put another big beer in bourbon barrels, which is probably true, but this one is successful in the end. I for one, give big thanks to a brewery who puts the effort into barrel aging, while keeping their prices at an affordable level, AND producing a very complex product.

I've actually got another bottle of this in the cellar, from a trip to NY earlier this summer, that I'm now certainly in no hurry to break into. We'll see how a few years treat this.

4.27,8.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at the Blind Tier Ale Hse in NYC a few weeks ago and reviewed from notes. Pours cloudy darkish, smoky almond, minor light tan head and leaving a tiny bubble film and fine light lacing. The nose here is boldly of crisp spicing and alcohol. One sip and its obvious that this a strong, heady and complex brew. Notes of currents, rum, brandy, burnt grains, alot going on here, not for the faint of heart/palate, not for quaffing, and not for fans of pissy yellow beer. Fine night capper/late night sipper.","Billolick","Apr 27, 2007"
3.52,-10.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a deep brown, somewhat hazy, with a big, light-brown head. Smells very spicy, yeasty, with hints of ripe fruit. Taste is very powerful, yeast, spice, raisins, and a lot of alcohol, too much alcohol. Very sweet. It is medium on the tongue, with a dryish finish. The alcohol burn makes this less drinkable than I would prefer, but all in all an occassional treat.","cichief","Apr 25, 2007"
3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The oak aging seems to take a little roast edge off the standard issue Quad. So it's just different enough to be new and still comfortably old. The ABV raises a rambunctious red alert, and only a simpleton would disregard the high-temp warning. Even so, finishing the bottle could carry consequences. And yet, in spite of this, I did enjoy it, and even if one bottle, or less, is the limit, it does leave a good impression in the end.","Foxman","Apr 24, 2007"
4.35,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. I was trying to compare this to Quad, and found this one a little more interesting. It had a dark amber color with a thin head. It had a sweet, fruity aroma, with a vinous character. An explosion of taste. Fruity, some chocolate, yeasty, and wine. I thought it was very smooth and mellow. However, I don't think I'd drink this and Quad together in one sitting again. Next time, Blasphemy alone.","lordofthewiens","Apr 23, 2007"
3.9,-1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a very good looking darkish brown color. Very impressive looking beer with excellent head retention and good lacing. The nose is not huge, but one gets a sense of sweet spices and oak on the nose. On the palate this beer is quite sweet with candy, cherries, vanilla, chocolate, licorise and raisens. The alcohol is pretty noticeable in this one, making it not the most drinkable of beers. Definitely a sipper, but a good beer for all that. The beer finishes moderately well; sweet with a bit of crispness/dryness at the end. A very good beer from Weyerbacher, albeit not the easiest beer to drink given the high abv.","John_M","Apr 21, 2007"
4.36,10.7,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"Overall, I highly recommend it if you like the style. Quads, on their own, are a bit of an acquired taste, so I think the same can be said about Blasphemy.","Contra","Apr 17, 2007"
3.95,0.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours an gorgeous ruby-orange with more a 1 finger head that leaves a few leaves of lacing. The smell on this one is wonderful - candied sugars, vanilla, a hint of the oak. The taste on this one is raw -- nice dark fruit, brown sugar, followed by a nice smooth oak back and a pronounced, borderline unpleasant, alcohol bite. My bet would be that this one will be very tasty if cellared for a while to mellow out the alcohol bite. Still, this one exhibits nice flavor complexity is quite enjoyable. I'll probably go back and buy a few bottles to hide for a while.","WAP","Apr 16, 2007"
3.95,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"22oz bomber from Florian's. Tramslucent copper-brown body with under a half inch of off-white head. Banana and woodiness dominate the aroma. Wood, banana, and spice all play prominent roles in the flavor. Lighter-bodied. Little carbonation to speak of. A pretty decent beer - more mellow and drinkable than its non-barrel-aged cousin.","MrHurmateeowish","Apr 16, 2007"

4.94,25.4,4,5,5,5,5,"Drinkability: For me this is second to how amazing Insanity is (which continues to be one of my favorites). And I say that especially after really not being a big fan of Eleven at all (here's high hopes for twelve, though). The barrel aging for Weyerbacher continues to be a great experiment, and one I'll certainly continue to look forward to. I'm a huge fan of the quad by itself, but this is just beyond amazing. I'm so glad they continue to be ballsy and not only be experimental, but make great beer while doing it.","asabreed","Apr 15, 2007"
4.68,18.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Oh yeah, found a new fave. Pours dark brown, looks a bit like a brown ale, very little head. Smells sweet, way to sweet. However the taste, oh yeah how to describe. Quite sweet but balanced with the high alcohol level, sweetness is like figs, strange artifical sweetner, alcohol and spices. This combo just works and it is damn delicious. Overall this is a very serious nightcap sipping beer. I have to get more of this, love it, highly recommended.","Manosbeeroffate","Apr 15, 2007"
4.48,13.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Wow, the hits just keep on coming form this brewery that stays on style while trying to be different. Blasphemy is a BIG beer that has great drink ability even at this young age. I'm still excited about the possibilities of this beer as it ages. The 11.8% ABV does not hide itself, it attacks your tongue, throat, and senses right off the bat. When held to the light, it shows to be a beautiful light red color. The pour for me was into a large goblet that produced a fine off- white head. The early flavor is all candy sugar with a hint of vanilla. The flavors are clean leaving a light aftertaste that fades to a fruity finish. The glass is coated with the oils and tannins with each sip. Mouthfeel seem perfect for the style. Drink this bad boy with care for the alcohol can and will get you. This is another one of those beer to add to the collection for future use, some winter night to come when a good book beckons, or to treasure in the distant future as the flavors meld and mature.","NJBeerguy","Beers"

4.11,4.3,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle. Tremendous tasting beer. Chewy dark fruit flavors, with hints of vanilla and a lovely sweetness overall. The oak component is nearly undetectable. It provides an extremely light toasted wood flavor, hints of vanilla, but no bourbon. In fact, I wouldnt think this was oak aged if they didnt mention it. Unfortunately, its not the most aromatic brew, but its still great. Weyerbacher is a really great brewery, imho.","Crosling","Apr 03, 2007"
4.08,3.6,5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability - A blend of sweetness and booziness dominate this fruity and slightly spicy quad.

3.97,0.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours brownish copper, mostly clear, with a small cream colored head that fades quickly. Aroma is soft and sweet, like a nice banana custard, some spices and bread, and a dose of alcohol. Taste is at first soft and sweet up front, spiced dessert bread. A slightly tannic oak comes in and mixes into the drying finish along with a major bite of alcohol that is warming and somewhat harsh. Medium to heavy in body, the beer is easily cut through by the large alcohol presence and the dry oak character. I enjoyed this beer, I liked its large bite of alcohol although its richness and strength would prohibit too much. Will definitely like to see if age mellows this or if it thins out.","hoppymeal","Mar 15, 2007"
3.58,-9.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"This ones needs a while to settle down. It's not undrinkable as it is now, but it will definitely improve by some softening, which only age can provide. I picked up a few bottles, and I'll give this one another go next year.","cbl2","Mar 13, 2007"
3.9,-1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"We were told in the tasting room at the brewery that the barrels used to oak age this beer were from Jack Daniels. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle purchased fresh from the brewery. Poured into a snifter glass. Appears a dark mahogany toned amber with about a finger of fluffy off-white head. Smells of whiskey soaked oak, sweet caramel, and vanilla. Tastes of whiskey soaked cherries, vanilla, candy, crisp fruit and alcohol. Rich and full bodied with nice carbonation. A very warming beer that is certainly a sipper. Well done Weyerbacher.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 09, 2007"
