It went well with food (Doro Wat) and I think it would pair well with a wide range of food.  While I was not able to have this at Christmas, I think I'm going to have to pick it up again next year and see if I can make it a Christmas day beer.

The spices are not overwhelming or unbalancing, but to me they still detract from the sweet, rich flavor characteristic of the style. I doubt I will try this again, but it's not because I didn't like it.

The flavor is breadier than I expected, almost marzen like, but obviously with greater potency.  Slightly spicy character, but more related to the yeast than actual spice additions.  Quite dry finish, with barely a hint of alcohol.  Lovely beer.","Andrew041180","Dec 25, 2014"

Taste is of alcohol soaked dark fruit, sweet bread, cherry, spice, pear, burnt caramel and toffee.  Great creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry.  Light medium body and scary drinkability for a beer with 10% alcohol.  This is a great Christmas beer with a seemingly endless flavor profile.","HopBomb515","Dec 24, 2014"

It's a bit cold, and I imagine the temperature is keeping the aroma subdued. There's some breadiness and a bit of spice. Lots of dark fruit and spices on the tongue, much like a fruitcake. Sweet toffee on the end, but not a huge aftertaste. It's very creamy, but not overly thick.

The aroma is heavy of dark fruits and sweet malt, with a very light nutmeg or allspice note. The taste is very nice, with sweet malt, figs, plums, raisins, nutmeg and a touch of vanilla blending superbly - not one overpowers any of the others. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, very smooth, with just a touch of alcohol burn. I think this one would really benefit from a bit of aging.

Aroma has much more fruit character than the 12, with lots of sweet cherry notes, caramel malts, funky Belgian yeast of course, and candi sugar. Much more muted hop notes here than the 12 as well. Flavor follows the smell closely with big sweet fruit flavors--tastes like the added cherries to this one, but can’t find info on fruit additions--light spice, candi sugar and sweet malts.

I'd love to buy a case of this and see how it evolves over the course of 12 years, but every vintage is different, it seems. The 2012, from what I can gather, is going to be quite generous in its development. The '13 is drinking supremely well as well, and whether fresh or aged, this beer really knocks most spiced beers out of the park, and perhaps most of its other Belgian peers overall.","magictacosinus","Feb 11, 2014"

The aroma offers delicate malt and hints of apple and maybe even a touch of clove. Weaker than I expected but it comes through if you give it a chance. The flavor commands an unusual fruit melange that includes cotton candy mango and grapefruit. Quite odd. At once interestingly nice but then a bit off-putting. Caramel malt is definitely there but the odd fermenting fruit flavors take over and it's attention getting. There's some cinnamon and grassy grain apple to top off this interesting brew. Alcohol is not overly notable but it's a little warming. The body is easily medium with a good fizzy carbonation that gives it a slightly lighter feel for the style.

Balanced, smooth and dangerously sessionable at its entirely undetectable 9.0%+ ABV, this is a present I want under my tree every year. I know that some purists out there may complain about "Specialty Market" this and that, but if every specialty beer could turn out like this one...wow. All I have to say is, "Vive le marché spécial!!!" Also...why is this not classified as a "Belgian Strong Dark"? Seriously, get it right, folks.","BeerDocT","Jan 20, 2014"

Nose of date, cherry, fig, roasted notes, booze, and sour tannins. Flavors are tart and crisp forward, with cherry tones forming a foundation beneath old-world fruit richness of date and fig. Very layered, very rich, and very balanced. Rich cherry and fig aftertaste, with earthy and woody notes. The finish is lingering sweet, with a perfect balance.

4.2,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice; best before 7/24/2017. Pours lightly hazy very dark red color with a 1 finger foamy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, light banana, brown sugar, molasses, toast, clove, pepper, brown bread, coriander, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with balanced malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, toast, brown sugar, coriander, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, banana, toast, brown sugar, clove, pepper, brown bread, coriander, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors with dark malt sweetness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong dark ale! Great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for 10%. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 16, 2013"

Plenty of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of banana, spices such as cinnamon and clove, malt, fig, and some caramel sweetness. The malt backbone is bready and mildly sweet with banana, cinnamon, clove, and fig. The 10% alcohol is well hidden in this beer. Saying the taste follows the nose is true, but it also understates the execution of the well-balanced and complex flavors in this beer. One flavor does not dominate the other. The beer is medium to full bodied with strong carbonation. This makes the beer smooth and dangerously drinkable.

There's a bit of plum, but overall the sweetness is more caramel than anything else. The clove phenol character is a bit more potent here, perhaps just a little too much for my taste. There's also a warming (but not hot) booziness that lingers a little bit. Can't argue with the mouthfeel though, as the beer is wonderfully dried out and drinkable for 10%, and the carbonation has plenty of life to it. The Christmas Ale isn't the most impressive beer in St. Bernardus's repertoire, but it's still a fairly solid strong Belgian brew.","axeman9182","Dec 09, 2012"

It is so perfectly balanced with intense caramel and spiced sweet apple, dark fruits, vanilla and notes of banana esters with a lingering tartness similar to a freshly baked apple pie. My concept of perfection, sweet fruitiness, caramelized burnt sugar, and cinnamon spice with no hoppy bitterness to spoil the experience. On my death bed I want a bottle of St. Bernardus Christmas Ale. Then at my wake I want everyone to drink St Bernardus Christmas Ale until they pass out to remember me by. Beer Advocate is a great place to learn about beer, but they should allow pictures of beer poured into a glass which is way more important than the appearance of the bottle.","wattoclone","Sep 12, 2012"

Base on the first pour I got mostly foam so I think there may an issue with the carbonation on this one. A latticework of thin rings lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bready malt, brown sugar, and some dark fruits. Taste is very much the same with a nice flavor of dark fruits (raisins, plums, etc.) on the finish. Like I suspected based on the pour, this beer has an extremely high level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Way overcarbonated in my opinion but without any indicators of infection or the like. Overall, this is a good BSDA and a very nice beer to sip on for Christmas night but the mouthfeel brings down my enjoyment of this beer.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 25, 2011"

One of the best smelling beers I've had in a long time, pronounced stone fruit presence, plums, raisins, red currants, a little bit of pluots, balanced nicely with floral hop aromas. Taste features the above stone fruit profile with healthy dose of caramel malt or dark candi sugar which provided quite a bit of residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is well on the full side of medium, good effervescence, a surprisingly astringent mouthfeel given the inherent sweetness. This has to be one of the world's best Christmas beers especially when aged, though drinkablility is a bit impaired by high ABV.","jdense","Dec 20, 2011"

4.01,-5.2,5,4,4,3.5,4,"I've been waiting to try this beer for a while but got totally shut out last year. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in my St. Bernardus chalice. Be careful opening this one - once I removed the cage the cork fired like a shotgun blast and ricocheted off the ceiling. Pours a deep plum color with a slightly hazy clarity. Head starts off as a fluffy, two inch, cream-colored cloud of foam. As the head recedes into a quarter inch cap, delicate, textured spots and strands of lacing are revealed and exhibit excellent adhesion. This beer looks exquisite in its proper glassware. Nose expresses dark fruits with a slightly vinous character, Belgian yeast and some nutty notes (perhaps hazelnut). Taste follows nose - flavor profile is pretty standard for the style in my opinion; however, there's a trace of ethanol that overshadows things a bit, making it difficult to tease out the subtleties. I also get a little wet cardboard towards the finish, but it dissipates quickly. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slightly prickly carbonation, as well as a bit of gassiness. Overall, a very solid Belgian Strong Dark; however, perhaps a little young. I would probably sit on this vintage for a couple more years.","Jwale73","Nov 15, 2011"

Big herbal, complex nose with hints of black cherries, metal, brown sugar, dark fruits, and tobacco. The taste is complex as well. Lots of black cherries, plums and bananas with a nice herbal backbone with hints of cinnamon, cloves and vanilla and just a touch of chocolate and orange peel. The finish is crisp and dry. The mouthfeel is carbonated, but slightly syrupy. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. It's not as "christmasy" as I had hoped, but still a classic beer from a great brewery.

Taste: brown sugar, tartish apple skin, red plum, cherry. Vinous again. Feel is extraordinarily creamy, but is also massively carbonated which boots the flavors from the tongue too early. Though the high carbonation and the decent but nondescript hopping keeps it from being really sweet. It might just be me or this bottle, but this one seems like a combo of a BSDA with a mild flanders red. Interesting, but odd. Best by 7/28/15, so bottled 7/28/10.","babaracas","Apr 13, 2011"

Candied fruit, plum pudding, hint of broth, burnt sugar and mulling spices scream X-mas to the nose. Carbonation smoothes the palate, silky with a delicate but thick medium body. Malt character is on the dry side for the most part; a smattering of caramel is in the middle. A bit hoppy with a side of phenols, all of which go herbal. Alcohol is pretty tame for 10 percent--it warms but does not rake the taste buds too much. Fruity, spicy and yeasty with hints of dark sugar and some earthy yeast in the drying finish.

Fairly rich and sweet on the attack but the body isn't as heavy. Compared to the Abt 12 this is less weighty and fairly drinkable.

A rich maltiness lurks beneath the fruit (and a solid helping of booze). Cocoa, pepper, and xmas spices. Wait for it to warm up a little to bring out the best qualities.

The head is so creamy that I could almost skim it off and eat it. Medium lacing is left on my glass. Smell is huge fruit and spices. There are yeasty/bread-like notes and a tiny bit of alcohol. I get cloves, coriander and pine in the nose as well. The smell is a bit too spicy to me. The taste is also very fruity. Dark fruits like raisins attack the mouth. Nutmeg, coriander and cloves also assault the palette. There is also a huge yeast taste but no alcohol, impressive for 10%ABV. The taste is a little over the top for me in fruits and spices. The mouthfeel is a bit watery to me. Not what I expected from the huge creamy head. Lighter body than I would want for a pretty big beer. A huge coat of spicy fruit is left on a warm tongue. As far as DB, drinking a lot of this would be tough. I am very happy that I halved the bottle because the spices become extremely powerful after even one pint. The alcohol also starts to get pretty hot as it warms up.","cbutova","Jan 09, 2010"

I'm tasting lots of fruit, mostly dark ones such as cherries, plums and raisins, also a hint of banana. Lots of Belgian yeast/biscuit taste, winter spice and molasses as well.

I'll be looking out for this in the future. As a seasonal treat this is a nice one to have and to serve. If it were not for the ABV I'd have another immediately this one is gone. Based on my experience with St. Bernadus Abt 12 I was expecting a more malt dominant brew as a Christmas seasonal. However, while this beer has malt present there is a very different balance between malt and hops than in the 12. Here the spiciness is never lost in the malt. At first I was not sure I liked this beer but as I have sipped my way slowly through it I find a growing appreciation for the balance of flavors. In addition this one has shown some very nice and interesting changes in flavors as it warmed to room temperature.","drtth","Nov 18, 2009"

Hints of vanilla and chocolate along with caramel give it a balanced sweetness and there is a good fruit base with orange and pear and a little citric notes.

In the taste, cinnamon, a dry sugary feel, and small hints of plum (as sugar plums danced in my head, sorry...) A small spicey bite, and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon/ spice aftertaste. Quite smooth and not overbarring, nice spices, all around pretty good.","OWSLEY069","Dec 09, 2008"

4.82,13.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"75cL bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours a hazy but still translucent dark copper with a half inch of light tan head. Smells intensely fruity and spicy, with banana, nut, and chocolate notes. Tastes fruity, chocolatey, and spicy, with an underlying toastiness. Banana, nut, cherry, dates, and cloves all play nearly equal roles. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with ample carbonation. More of a sipper, though one sip most definitely invites another and this beer was gone long before I wanted it to be. Wow. Quite possibly the best beer this brewery makes, a phenomenal Christmas beer, and one of the most flavorful and complex beers I've had all year. Amazing!","MrHurmateeowish","Dec 08, 2008"

Aroma is very deep, with fig, overripe plum, green apple, caramelized orange peel, ginger, phenols, and a touch of saccharine cola. Flavor is a little more straightforward. Rummy raisins, orange peel, ginger, and licorice. Alcohol and carbonation are a bit too apparent and so this beer is not particularly drinkable, but it is a nice warming winter treat to share.","illidurit","Dec 07, 2008"

The heat from the alcohol makes it difficult to drink and detracts from some of the flavors that otherwise may emerge. I sampled on-tap, but I think getting a bottle of this and sitting on it for a year may do it some good.","BamaBeerBuff","Dec 07, 2008"

Aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, cinnamon, bread, yeast, pepper, cloves, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a good bit of alcohol/booze and also a slight metallic taste noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium with high carbonation. Way too much carbonation for my taste. This hurts the drinkability for me. The high carbonation makes this brew hard to drink, it feels like I'm drinking bubbles and not liquid. Overall it's a decent brew, but would be much better if the carbonation was cut down some. It looks good and tastes good, but it's not easy to drink at all.","bluejacket74","Mar 14, 2008"

Smell seemed very bready with a hint of maybe figs and...raisins? The taste had a lot of alcohol. Alcohol was the first thing that I could tast and the last. In between, were the flavors of figs, a faint taste of anise, more bread and a hint of toffee. Overall, a very nice beer to wrap up to on a very cold evening.

Head is an off-white tan in color, creamy smooth in texture, and has nice lacing. Aroma is complex with cirtus hoppy-ness coming throught the most. Allspice and a light yeasty-dough aroma is second, followed by many other smells including chocolate, apple, and possibly even red wine. Flavor was pleasent, starting on the sweetish side and over a long duration finishing ever so slightly bitter-sour with defined fruit undertones. Medium in body with a lively carbonated but creamy texture, the overall mouth feel is clearly the best part of this brew. Pretty good stuff.","BMan1113VR","Feb 07, 2008"

Great aroma - figs and prunes, apple, cinnamon, bready and yeasty, floral hops, bubblegum, pear, and mild medicinal alcohol. Sweet with some warm alcohol up front, dried fruit in the middle, with bread crust towards the end. It finished with a flash of gingerbread and lingering peppery alcohol. Medium to full bodied with very high carbonation. Palate coating with a bit of slickness and warmth. A great winter warmer with pleasing fruity notes.

Very inviting nose. Subtly, yet very pleasing to the sense of smell. Doughy yeastiness with bready malts and cinnamon spiciness blend to give the warm aroma of comfort. Biscuity malt base serves nicely for the layers of complexity on top. Spice tones intermingle with fruits and candy. Light alcoholic tones are present to create a little warmth. Body is light-medium and the carbonation lends an ever so sublte effervescence to the whole experience.

Body is slighly murky dark chocolate color with very active carbonation. Leaves bubbly, spidery lace. Rich and malty aroma with spice, herbs, and a little fruit (apple). Maybe a hint of chocolate and a bit of alcohol smell as well. Big malt IF with slightly acidic finish that is long lived, slowly mellowing to a pleasant bitterness on the tongue.

It is still a little sharp, I think a little time in the bottle will smooth out the edges. Nevertheless, it is still delicious now. Pours a beautiful dark brown with a batter like head- big, thick, and creamy and which leaves excellent lacing. Aromas of sweet malt, banana, alcohol, and cookie dough. Well carbonated with flavors of pffefernuse- black pepper, clove, cinnamon, coriander, and cookie dough. Not overly sweet, in fact there is a dry somewhat astringent bitterness throughout that nicely offsets the spice cookie flavors. Delicious! Mouthfeel is carbonated, full, spicy, and creamy.

Not sure I could wait that long, but I do think a few years would definitely reward the cellarer (cellarer?) with a more robust, full beer.It would take a very, very strong cheese to hold up to this.

The taste starts matly, fruit, brown sugar, spiced seasoning, just a fantastic array of flavors and aromas massaging the palate. The finish is slightly tart on the back of the throat, hard to make out any specific christmas spices in this brew but that doesn't matter to me.

4.3,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Murky brown in appearance. A very dense, thick off white head. Pillow like sticky lacing, that hangs around. Aromas of raisins, tons of other dark fruits, and spices. Well blended flavors of dark fruits, tart grape, candied sugar, mild chocolate, and some spices of clove and cinnamon. Finishes with some warming alcohol. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Highly carbonated, very fizzy. Drinkability is excellent and very enjoyable. Very similar to Abt 12. If you like boozy beers, then this one's for you. CHEERS!","DavidEddie","Dec 24, 2007"
4.11,-2.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"The perfect looking Belgian brew, deep, murky brown with dark ruby highlights and a great, thick retaining head. The only thing that its look is lacking is the bubbling. The aroma is very Belgian and awesome in that sense, but not very Christmasy. Makes me think of figs and sweet bread. The taste is very pretty sweet and complex. Lots of brown sugar with some with a few spices. Hints of clove and cinnamon. But just not as seasonal as expected.","scruffwhor","Dec 23, 2007"
4.06,-4,5,4,4,4,4,"Well two days till Christmas so time to pop the cork on this one. The bottle poured ruby red with a large billowy light coco brown head. Aromas of Belgium yeast, fruit and spices (cinnamon, ginger and clove) filled my nose. This ale has a full creamy mouth feel with carbonation that tickles the tongue. The first thing I noticed about the Flavors was sweet fruit figs and raisins with a nice balance of Christmas spices. A nice bitter finish that is not to over whelming, almost the typical peppery bite. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this beer will sneak up on you. Great holiday offering from St. Bernardus hope to find another one for next year.","joepais","Dec 23, 2007"

4.32,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer was dark brown with a thick head, but lacked the floaties from ABT 12 and the creaminess in the foam that ABT 12 provides. Still looked OK, just closer ot the Prior 8 in appearance. The aroma was the signature yeastie fruitiness, but with a hint of spice I haven't noticed in the sibling beers. This spice came through in the flavor as a peppery note, a little biting, I'm not sure how to record it except "cracked pepper". Very nice, definitely you'd know in a blind taste test who made it, but you'd also know it was a little different. Highly recommended, along with all their other beers.","TurdFurgison","Dec 09, 2007"
4.28,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This is another prodigious offering from St. Bernardus. This pours a deep brown with a frothy, thick, dark head that plumes on the sides of the glass and leaves tons of lacing. The beer also retains quite well with soapy head still lingering in my fluted glass well after I've had a few sips. The smell is sweet malts, candied sugars, yeastiness, Xmas spices, such as nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange rind. The carbonation of this beer will keep you burping and then some. This is a medium bodied beer that hits all the right notes. The taste is very Belgian throughout, you'll get the candied sugars, malty sweetness, spices, yeasty bite, and the sweet caramel and butterscotch flavors. The high ABV is masked over quite well, although there are some warming alcohol notes that arise towards the end. The aftertaste is very modest, all things considered. This one is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim","albern","Dec 08, 2007"

The aroma is sweet malt, dark fruits, spices and yeast. The taste is sweet malt and an array of spices with a rather dry, spicy and boozy finish. Overall, this is another good beer from St Bernardus. I am curious to see how this one ages, it should improve greatly with a little more time.","cjgator3","Nov 29, 2007"
4.26,0.7,3.5,5,4.5,2.5,4,"Poured a rich dirty brown into goblets, with a spotty dark head; lacing lasted through to the end. Piney smell, and the taste was full of spices. A touch of bitterness showed through, perhaps making it taste even more like Christmas. I poured it chilled initially and wasn't very impressed, but it improved tremendously as it warmed up a bit. Great to have by the fire during the holiday season, and the bottle size makes it nice to share with friends/family.","KiltedCulinarian","Nov 24, 2007"

Good amounts of alcohol on the finish in the chest as well. A definite winner.","mcallister","Nov 20, 2007"

4.1,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"hazy reddish brown w/ tons of bubbles and huge off white head. great belgian lace and great retention. I was surprised by the hop character that was really really present in the nose. i imagine that will mellow out with time, and i am exited to see how this will tate next year. nose was musty, earthy hops, malt, spice (cinnamon, ginger?) dark fruit and booze. taste was dark fruit, roast, spice, hops and hints of booze. in both the nose and the taste, i could detect something new every pass. i think this one needs a little time, but the full body (which seems lighter because of the heavy carbonation) is smooth, and this is another solid solid beer from one of my favorite breweries.","timtim","Nov 09, 2007"
3.63,-14.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a cloudy dark amber color and formed a very airy large head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast and candy. The flavor was of malt, caramel and candy. Fairly light compared to other styles by this brewery. The finish was quite sprite. Not a bad beer, but not up to the others from the brewery. Aging may help this one to improve.","Wildman","Nov 07, 2007"

Color is murky brown... typical, but nice. Leaves icicle like lacing around the sides. Even though the bottle suggests drinking this a bit cold for the style, I'd really recommend letting this one warm up a bit. I was SLIGHTLY disappointed when I first cracked this one,but now with a little more than a half left in the bottle, at a warmer temp... This is a fantastic beer. Glad I bought a few bottles! Nice addition the Bernardus line-up.","amiles","Nov 04, 2007"
4.4,4,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Rather carbonated, but it's the nice small bubble thick carbonation I've grown to love that leaves a velvet mouthfeel with just a bit of a bite. I rate this high on drinkability because I think I could sit around and sip on this all night long. It's not drinkable in the usual sense of the word but being so highly enjoyable you don't want your glass to ever empty.","kleffman","Nov 03, 2007"

4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer is very carbonated, maybe a little too much since it stings a bit as it rests on the tongue.
