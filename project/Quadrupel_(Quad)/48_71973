4.99,20.5,4.75,5,5,5,5,"Got this on tap at Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, PA, when I dropped my kid off at college.  Whoda thunk?  I was pretty amazed at the flavor, dried fruit like raisins and prune, good malt and very yeasty but very little hops.  Very high alcohol percentage but it doesn't show up so much in the flavor, more a warmth as it goes down your throat.  It pours a light brown, lighter than the Gulden Draak dark triple.  Carbonation is good, not too much, small bubbles like a good champagne and it has a very rich mouth feel.  I like it better than the dark triple; possibly the best beer I've ever tasted.  I wonder if it would be as good in bottles and I wish I could find it in stores.  The dark triple is now available in Wegman's but not not the 9000.","650bguy","Feb 22, 2015"

Poured a one finger white head over an amber body into a 25 cl La Trappe chalice from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle. Light, musty fruit smell. Tastes of toffee and tobacco, with a subtle fruit sweetness, and a unique ginger ale type undercurrent. Absolutely spectacular effervescent, mouth-puffing mouthfeel, a leader in the style, right up there with St. B abt 12.

Has some flavor similarities to more traditional quads like St. Bernardus Abt 12 or Trappist Rochefort 10 but has an interesting and welcome twist on the style. Not my favorite quad but still very drinkable.","AZbelgian","Dec 31, 2014"

Not brilliant but definitely not opaque. A nice cream lacing after each sip. On the nose, lots of fruits: pear, peach, tangerine as well as other citrus in addition to the exceptional yeasty breadiness as well as some carmelly toffee. Taste is excellent. Think triple hefeweizen (as pertaining to the triple IPA usage) if that style existed. The belgian yeast is at the forefront here dominating the palate. Pretty much mirrors the aroma with the addition of banana, clove, raison, dates, plum, jelly and fig but the aftertaste has a slight fruity sourness to it which is delightful. Atypical for the style but an astonishing beer nonetheless. If you like Gulden Draak this is definitely worthy. If you don't like Gulden Draak then you must not like Belgian beers and are henceforth unworthy.","Brewstradamus","Nov 07, 2014"

Aroma is rich, of peaches, or stone fruit.  Flavor is comparatively mild/neutral.  Yeasty and fizzy.  It just doesn't have the depth of flavor I want in a quad.  What it does have, however, is impeccable balance, and the perfect disguise for its massive ethanol payload.  I must disagree on this point with my fellow reviewers, apparently. Very drinkable, just not all that interesting.  But apparently I had the same complaint about St. Stefanus when I reviewed that.  I really must pick up and review the standard Gulden Draak (Tripel) as well as Piraat, which I remember quite liking.  There's just no excuse for a beer this heady and drinkable to be so middling in a category like Belgian Quad.","hreb","Oct 22, 2014"

4.25,2.7,,,,,,"As a big fan of Gulden Draak, I was excited when my local Belgian import focused bar got the 9000 in. I was a little disappointed, to be honest, as I very much enjoy the Tripel, but that said, the 9000 was still an outstanding beer. Very fruity and earthy, fans of Gulden Draak will encounter that same almost-pungent flavor that distinguishes its cousin from other tripels, but the 9000 does very little to improve on the experience, while upping the price tag slightly. I'd recommend sticking with the tripel.","higherbrow","Sep 18, 2014"

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 11/19/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, plum, golden raisin, apricot, white grape, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear, apple, golden raisin, plum, apricot, white grape, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, golden raisin, plum, apricot, white grape, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/prickly moutfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome pale Quadrupel style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 12, 2014"

I let mine hang out in the cellar for around 8 months or so before finally getting down to brass tacks this afternoon. Poured into a goblet, this brew is a dark honey amber color rather than brown, with around four inches of light-colored head that disappeared quite quickly. Aroma reminds me of a saison, with nutty, spicy, funky yeast paving the way and pungent sweet honey and cooked fruit bringing up the rear. Smells quite a bit like fermented prune juice. Palate is richly sweet and spicy, with honeyed breakfast cereal, golden syrup, cooked applesauce, pumpkin, sultana raisin, prunes, clove, coriander, and dry burlap sack/horse blanket all blending together. Unique combination of flavors yet still a quintessentially Belgian "malt bomb". Fairly thick and syrupy body, an effect amplified by the relatively tame carbonation. Hard to taste much in the way of hops. Certainly has its own charm, even if I do prefer the more traditional dark takes on the style.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 17, 2014"

Appears a deep amber bronze hue with billowing off white head forms thick fine even bubbled carbonation, Belgian lacing clings to the glass this is effervescence. Aromatics offer up deep dark fruit notes with raisins and tart apples, mild slightly spicy herbal hop notes. Flavor is tart up front with the fruit punching the palate, think green raisins and tart apple slices blending into a malty mix of alcohol and herbal hops. Big bad Belgian ale at manageable costs in a mixed six pack format, super sweet finish is almost killing this for me. They came out with new beers that are bigger or the same in alcohol with really noticeable alcohol on the palate and unfermented sugars making it overtly sweet. So one dimensional it pains me to see they did this to a great complex big Belgian ale like Gulden Draak, carbonation is solid, but the finish is a mix of alcohol heat and cloying sticky sweet malts.

I'm definitely more of a triple fan these days. BUT - just had a a Gulden Draak 9000 and it is perfect. Superb - dry -with the essence of sweet plums and brown sugar. Phenomenal.

4.45,7.5,4.5,3.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml into a tulip. Dark orange/medium amber beer with a huge number of effervescent tiny bubbles and a cream colored, dense head. Completely clear. The nose is bready, like a lightly toasted challah. Orange marmalade, toast, and toffee on the tongue, with a tad of alcoholic warming on the finish. Spritzy and medium-bodied. A bit unusual for a "quad," in that it presents very much like a trippel, in color, nose and flavor profile. An outstanding beer.","MCDuhamel","Sep 19, 2013"

4.36,5.3,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"OVERALL : After cleaning up the beer that spilled on opening - even though you handled the bottle like live nitroglycerin - and waiting a full 5 minutes for the head to shrink to something less than 5/6 of your glass, you'll have an amazing time. Well worth waiting for, and well worth buying lots of it. A very well done lighter quad that can be drunk in a wide variety of occasions.","FrostBlast","Sep 19, 2013"
4.21,1.7,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, amber-gold coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, white head that starts tall and slowly settles into a surface coating. Nose of apricot, pineapple, toffee, caramel, roast, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The different aroma characteristics come together masterfully, remaining balanced and avoiding overpowering the senses. Flavors are bold and smooth, with a solid caramel backbone supporting a warming booze character, spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice, and a fleeting highlight of bubblegum, old world fruit, and some earthy notes. Very bold, very robust, and a touch of heavy. The body is robust, but kept slightly light and effervescent through the carbonation. Rich sweetness and booze warmth in the aftertaste, with an old world fruit linger and building warmth in the finish. Great beer.","GarthDanielson","Sep 18, 2013"

I will be buying this again, in my opinion this one almost rivals the beloved Rochefort 10, AND is cheaper is by about $3.00 where I live.

It's to be expected for a Quadrupel and while this wasn't as good or as dark as the Trappist Quads that I've had, this held its own and was certainly worth a go once. I view it more as a strong Tripel than a Quad if only because the hue and styles of fruit were different but aside from my take on this, this was a Quad in every sense of the word and worth a go for anyone patient enough to enjoy all this had to offer.","JerzDevl2000","May 14, 2013"

3.97,-4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Lots of carbonation. Poured a deep gold with a huge white head. Some Belgian yeast spice and a little alcohol in the nose. Bottle conditioned. Not as boozy as the nose would suggest. Fair amount of malt sweetness with more Belgian spice in the finish. Way too easy drinking for the ABV! You could get in trouble with this.","homebrewhawk","May 26, 2012"

Intense sugar, figs & spices to the nose. Gentle sugary upfront then increasing alcohol lingers into the end. Slightly peppery in the middle, just an illusion, fluid molasses all around –no cloying even though-. Full body, moderate carbonation. Pleasant drinkability.

This beer, for me, is highly yeast driven as I picked up the aroma of spices, and somewhat of dried banana and corriander. VERY nice. A great pallet cleanser, and very enjoyable brew. A lighter SRM to its original version. Cheers.","Chinoman01","Beers"

Although it’s high on ABV (10.5% ABV) so perfect for splitting. It’s very good, and drinkable. I would buy and drink again and again and again. Lekker! Note, in Belgium the bottle is titled Gulden Draak 9000 Quadruple; in Dutch/Flemish it means golden dragon.","slammgrass","Feb 19, 2012"

I'm super excited about this one, as I love the regular Gulden Draak. The nose is Belgian yeast, fruits, raisins, dates, and spices. Not quite as complex as the standard Draak. Taste is the same- it's just not quite as amazing and complex as the regular Gulden Draak. It's still really good- just not amazing. Feel steps it up a notch. Very little of the 11.3% ABV is evident- they hid it somewhere. Overall, this is a really good beer that falls short of great. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Sep 14, 2011"

This is a scarey kind of dangerous, by the time you feel the ABV you've slammed back a couple and its too late. Will be buying many bottles of this.","rudzud","0"
