Except maybe for the lack of cherries (they're probably stirred in there somewhere with the rest of their fruity brethren), but since the brewer was up front about their subtly, Imma let that one pass.  Crazy easy to drink, and equally enjoyable, this is a worthwhile ode to the Belgian monastic greats, and from a place where they can see the dead center of Flyover Zone, USA.","biboergosum","Friday at 12:44 PM"

Tastes much like a tradition quadrupel but you pick up the oak bourbon barrels. The bourbon is subtle and smooth.  Dark fruit, cherries I think, are noticeable on the front and back end.

4.43,4,4.75,4.75,4.25,4,4.5,"Overall: This blends the complexity of a good Belgian with the power of a potent bourbon barrel nicely. It drinks a touch hot, but there are few nigh-12% ABV barrel-aged beers that can conceal that - a spot of age might take a bit of the edge off as well. I don't know that I would ever reach for this over a good non-barrel-aged quad, but perhaps trying one with some age on it might change that opinion.","UrbanCaveman","Feb 05, 2015"

Maybe I kept it for too long but I didn't think the cherry notes came through as strong and it seemed a bit strong for me.

I cellared it for a year, and decided to start the New Year, and tick off my 1,0000th beer rating on BA, with this truly excellent brew.  Upon pulling the cork, a sweet aroma of cherries and licorice arise from the bottle.  Poured from the 750 ml bottle into a Jester King goblet, the smell is intensified.  The head is thick, light brown in color, with fine lacing that traces the glass as the beer is quaffed. The body of the brew is orange-brown, with tiny bubbles rising from below, like champagne. The first sip of this abbey style quadrupel highlights the aroma, with a trace of vanilla and bourbon flavor coming through.  Despite it's 11.8 abv you can barely taste the alcohol, which is layered with all the other flavors that roll around on your tongue.  I know not many beers I enjoy this coming year will be quite as grand as this one, because it sets the bar high, but I am thrilled to be starting 2015 with such a fantastic example of what beer can be!","rorjets","Jan 01, 2015"

4.8,12.7,,,,,,"Wow, a fantastic beer!  Sometimes the Belgian style beers don't work for me ... I think it's related to the yeast they generally use.  However this one is delicious.  First, upon removing the cork you get a very strong pop ... probably the strongest of any beer I've uncorked.  I expected high carbonation as a result but that's not the case ... carbonation level is perfect.  Taste is exquisite.  There are certainly bourbon barrel overtones.  Practically no hop bitterness.  The alcohol is well hidden but warming.  My only gripe is the cherries ... I think this would be an even better beer without them.","Vierenner","Oct 18, 2014"

4.2,-1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 8/19/2013. Pours hazy deep reddish orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, tart cherry, clove, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, coconut, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity fruity/spicy yeast, cherries, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, tart cherry, clove, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, coconut, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light fruity tartness and moderate yeast/oak spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, cherry, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, coconut, toast, brown sugar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate tart cherry flavors; with a great malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly slick, and lightly syrupy/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged quadrupel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate tart cherry flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2014"

That said, the beer is pretty to look at and is a good drink. Very tasty and satisfying--I just wouldn't call it a quad. Also, the reviewer below me said it reminded him of Westvleteren 12.

The taste is big and bold with huge oak notes along with hints of vanilla, bourbon, toffee, and caramel. The cherries are a bit more prevalent and add a subtle sourness to the flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy with fizzy carbonation and a slightly sour finish. The drinkability for an 11.8% beer was off the charts. Overall, I was very impressed with this beer.

Taste is Carmel, vanilla, and candied sugar, with hints of pecan. Light body for the style which makes the mouthfeel pleasant for such a strong abv. Overall really good, just not great. Simple profile for the style. Age on this bottle, and the way Otha's smoothed out, makes me think this one could go much longer and do well.

The taste is a combination of sour and bourbon, with a bit of the Belgian yeast component in the mix. Bourbon stands out in the finish more than up-front. As a quad it seems passable but below average (not enough of an estery complexity.) As a bourbon-aged beer it's slightly above-average with a nice finish. Actually for a beer with such a light mouthfeel, it does carry the bourbon pretty well. It isn't super-complex, and I'm not sure that aging it really did anything for it. But it's nice and I'd buy it again.","foobula","May 02, 2014"

This is another beer that I'd say the bourbon barrel subtracted from what could have been an amazing cherry Quad. Too much oak and an overwhelming alcohol presence. I'm torn though because hidden under the barrel I can sense the great tart, dark fruit beer there, wish I could taste more of the yeast. A bit disappointing but still a complex beer that has some nuances, wish all the flavors were just a delicate.","PaulyB83","Dec 25, 2013"

Tastes of figs (have I ever had figs or have I just had a lot of quads?), cherries (non sour, the kind Chilli's Restaurant carries), bourbon. Lemme point out that it is a muttled amount of bourbon. You know, the warm kind that comes from bourbon barrel aging? If I'm wrong, mail me your foot so you can kick me in the teeth. Big body, easy carbo. I think I'm too far gone. I took the roller coaster. I started with the Godhead (Bud, Miller, Coors), then I went Belgium, then American craft, then only drinking insane crafts, then back to cheap beer, now at crafts again. But I can't fully enjoy great craft brew because my fondest memories are stuck in the past during my discovery stage. All of my personal beer psychology set aside, this is a good brew.

Tart cherries do come through in the aroma, as does some slightly boozy oakines and hints of dark fruits like toffee and a little bit of yeast. Smooth, medium to heavy bodied, the yeast and barrel aging keep the beer smooth and not too sharp, although there is a crisp finish as the beer has a good amount of carbonation. Great balance of vanilla, toffee, and other sugary sweetness and some figs and dark fruit and those tart cherries have some play as well. Great sipper and the booze is kept under wraps so it's not too harsh as it warms.","clayrock81","Dec 05, 2013"

I like this fresh better than aged, as the older version (2010) thins out quite a bit, loses its more tasty sweet elements, and takes on a peculiar cocktail sauce horseradish funk that just doesn't belong in a beer, at least not in a quad. fresh through, the vanilla is large, and the wood is campy and mature. there is a statesman quality about this, formal in a way, but lax enough to kick the shoes off too. a good mix. not arrogant, but certainly not laying low in the background either. this is a robust beer, with just enough carbonation and a little less body than most American made quads. I appreciate it for what it is, but would not that its overpriced and a must share bottle at almost 12% abv. get it while you can, I don't think its being made anymore...","StonedTrippin","Feb 16, 2013"

Aroma of smashed cherries, brown sugar, and a mix of bourbon and fusel alcohol. Tastes of brown sugar, vanilla, candi sugar, dark fruit notes, and oak soaked in bourbon and moonshine, with the woodiness taking an edge over the booziness. Medium body, moderate carbonation, enjoyable, but not very smooth, and maybe a bit too messy. Still a solid brew overall.","Rifugium","Jan 29, 2013"

It has a real tart nose with a slight bit of "funk." Dark and candied fruit scents mix in nicely. The bourbon isn't overly apparent at this point. The taste is more cherries. Nice and tart, but far from sour. It's so well played. The bourbon again is subtle. It's not dominant, which, is actually good. Probably one of the best examples of well executed bourbon barreling. For a person that hates sours or quads...I'm diggin' this. The mouth is nice and crisp. Good carb, a nice tartness, and a finsih that's a tad bitter. The alcohol is indeed present at this stage.

4.12,-3.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"2011 Vintage. Pours a reddish-bown, almost mahogany color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is dark fruits at first with a good amount of bourbon and sweet cherries. Somewhat of a tart aroma as well...most likely due to the whiskey. A good amount of vanilla and oak as well. Taste is not what I was expecting, with an immediate somewhat tart cherry flavor. The tartness immediately turns to sweet cherry and vanilla with nice oak presence. Lovely whiskey flavors throughout, along with a bouquet of dark fruits. A little bit of chocolate as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is high for such a rich and high ABV beer. Overall, this is another great beer from Boulevard. So lucky to have such a great friend who lives in Kansas!","DovaliHops","Jun 17, 2012"

It has a strong influence from the bourbon and the cherries. It does well to bring each flavor boldly; however I wish they were a little better blended together as the transition from bourbon to sour and funk is a little rough.","jeonseh","Jun 15, 2012"

Tastes of bourbon sweetness with some heat, again upfront, followed by notes of dark cherries and some raisins too. Great lasting finish.

That is a Quad that looks, tastes, and feels like a Quad with cherry. Boulevard is not for me for I enjoy flavor instead of wet socks.

The nose comprises light rye bread, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, and a tough of mild cherry way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some oak. The bread is stronger now, and the cherries come through as a sort of vague tart cherry-ness pervading the general backdrop of the proceedings. (Yeah, that makes nothing but sense, right?) The body is a strong medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a rather enjoyable brew, one that thankfully doesn't overdo it on either barrel or cherry aspects. Good times.","TMoney2591","Dec 18, 2011"

4.12,-3.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to aasher for this one as I have been wanting to try it for QUITE some time! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy red-orange with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, cherry, caramel, and toffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, subtle tart, fruit, slight metallic, toffee, and cherry. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. THere were a lot of complexities that I would not have expected from this brew going on. This made it quite enjoyable and kept me guessing on each sip which I like. The alcohol on this one was definitely covered up quite well. Definitely worth trying if you have not done so already.","thagr81us","Oct 28, 2011"
4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Shared at a local tasting event. Poured into snifter glass. Pours a murky reddish-brown color with a good thick tan head that fades somewhat quickly to a thin frothy layer. There’s lots of bourbon and wood in the aroma along with the cherries. Belgian yeast and candi sugar join the scent as well but are not as noticeable as expected. The flavor adds vanilla, dried mixed fruit, toffee, and light spice, that go along with the cherries and bourbon, which still stand out here. The wood shows mostly in the finish with a lot of wet barrel notes surfacing. The more traditional Quad flavors are diluted; Belgian yeast, dark fruit, candi sugar, they are here, but rather than being at the forefront they are burried beneath the strong bourbon and cherry. This shows every bit of 11.8% with a rather sharp alcoholic tang that just seems to keep getting stronger the more I drink this. Medium mouthfeel and decent carbonation throughout. Overall a great sipping Quad!","CuriousMonk","Oct 25, 2011"
4.05,-4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: The citrus was good in respect to mouthfeel but completely overwhelmed the taste and aroma not nearly as complex as other quads, kind of hard to get past the tartness.

2.18,-48.8,3,2.5,2,2,2,"This was an extra in a trade, thanks Jim. Pours cherry red with a bunch of large bubbles rising up, then receding to a collar around the edges. Nose is heavy oak, sour cherries, a light and sweet vinegar touch. Really comes across like some weird American sour. Mouth is super sharp carbonation with a palate of butter, oak, sour cherry, brett. I don't know if wild yeast was actually used with this but it has the wet sock aspect of brett. Alcohol heat and some caramel type malts bring up the back. I have to say, this is completely disgusting. Just way too much of everything, and the buttery, brett like elements clash horribly with the base beer. Could be a Cigar City sour, probably.","JAXSON","Aug 22, 2011"

I have loved all the Boulevard Smokestack beers I have had to date but I will not be seeking this one ever again. I cannot say this very often, but I wish there were more bourbon flavors in this beer and less pure alcohol burn.

Aroma has some bourbon, cherries, other pit fruit and its quite bretty. This smells somewhat like Consecration. Taste is sweet with a bit of sour. The barreling adds some depth and the is quite a bit of heat developing in the throat and chest. I don’t imagine that the sourness is intentional, but its not bad. At this point, I wish it were more sour or more sweet. The base beer at this time doesn’t seem to add much to this beer. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Smooth, but hot finish. Again, I don’t know if this is the intended beer of the brewer, but its not bad at all. As a Quad, it has a long way to go, but a good American take on it.","trappistlover","Jun 14, 2011"

Underneath there is a nice malt backbone with hints of chocolate and caramel and plenty f peppery spice and dark fruit notes. Hints of raisiin, plum, fig, cherry.

Beer is downright ugly and the nose is nothing that I'd expect from the style. After trying though, I know better. This beer is an extremely solid creation. Innovation in all the right ways, this beer is actually better than most traditional quads that I've had. Feel is to die for also. Well worth seeking out.","SpeedwayJim","May 09, 2011"

4.22,-0.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5," The taste has a good amount of stone fruit notes mainly tart cherry with some sour tropical fruit accents and highly herbal notes that verge on woody in taste, a complex flavor with light bourbon and hints of golden raisin with a mild amount of malt sweetness. The toasted and caramel flavor blends well with the light fruit in the yeast. An interesting array of fruit and flavors from the barrel and contributed by the yeast makes this a very unique and engaging beer. I am glad I got to try this. The unexpected sour tinge really brings out some quad qualities you don't normally get -thanks to Capones for the taste.","Slatetank","Apr 28, 2011"

Not a good quad, but not a bad American Wild at this point for this particular bottle.

The taste is fantastic, a perfectly balanced blend of malt, bourbon, sour cherries, wood, and spice box. Very nice, and unusually sour, not something I expected from a quad.

Complex aroma of cherries, and lightly funky wood barrel. Deep Belgian aromatic malt and light bourbon aroma. Nice quad flavor up front, Belgian malt. Mid palate I get some musty cherry, wood and just a hint of bourbon. This beer is got more basement then expected. The body made more full by the wood and cherry.

Sadly I've already finished my 4 bottles and can't find it anywhere else, but if you can find it, grab more than one so you can take a few shots at getting to the heart of it.

And he's right - it does not taste like a BMC beer. I offered a taste to my mother who is really a wine drinker and she totally dug it, but just a small glass was enough. I could have easily drank the whole thing myself - the 2.5 glasses I had were enough for the evening.

Usually there are more defined layers of flavor in brews. This particualr brew I felt the flavors were all fighting for dominance of the beer. Then I continued to sip on it letting warm gradually. Threw out the drink the flavors begain to exchange roles in this particular brew. The Bourbon, Quad Flavor, and Oak were exchanging places back and forth.

This bottle says it is No. 3459 out of 11248. This beer looks intriguing. It is a dark brown with burnt red accents. It poured smoothly and medium in body with a two finger light khaki head. The aromas come in waves. It first hits you with a cherry sweetness before going tart. It then finishes with a nice, smooth bourbon finish. The flavor too has different phases. It begins with excellent, sharp cherry tartness before heading into the bourbon and then finishing sweet. It drinks very smoothly and is soft on the palate. I'm a little surprised since this beer is so fresh. The only reason I don't give it a five on drinkability is the alcohol content. It wouldn't be as noticeable if not for the bourbon. Excellent, top notch beer.","aasher","Dec 23, 2010"

Mouthfeel is sticky and pleasantly carbonated. Drinkability is good. There is a warming alcohol finish that warns you to stay on your toes. A very good outing from Boulevard.

When held to light it reveals a beautiful ruby haze. Smell is a combination of tart fruit and alcohol. Taste is what sets this apart. I know its not your typical Quad, but with a taste of tart fruit and yeast with a slight bourbon hint, I dont think I really want a "by the book" Quad. Mouthfeel is smooth when it first hits the palate, then sharp when the alcohol hits. I looked forward to each and every sip. Drinkability is high due to the flavor, but with and 11.8 abv, better make sure someone else is driving. Boulevard hit the nail on the head with BBQ.

I was hoping for a little bit of lacing and BBQ didn't really deliver, just keeping it from earning a 5 for looks. Smell is of a typical quad, along with a heavy bourbon barrel aroma, but the cherries are imperceptible. The nose has me a little worried, I'm hoping this isn't an overly boozy mess like some barrel aged beers can become. The first sip makes me feel terrible for being a non believer, this beer tastes incredible. The expected dark fruit quad flavor is upfront, along with some vanilla from the barrels. Oak and a subtly tart cherry flavor do battle for attention in the background. There's also a slight warming alcohol sensation, but it's not harsh and melds in well with the other flavors. The only thing keeping this beer from being world class is the mouthfeel. The body is a little thin for such a big beer, it could stand to be more rich, and the carbonation is just a tad too fizzy. Despite that, the great flavor and seamless integration of alcohol make this eminently quaffable. This is my first beer from Boulevard, consider me extremely impressed.","axeman9182","Aug 14, 2010"

This character blends nicely with the malty, bready deliciousness of the base quad. Some light bourbon flavors start to come out as it warms up which gives this a nice complexity.

Pours a reddish brown, or mahogany color, with a large beige head that had excellant retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Unique aroma for a quadrupel. It is a combination of Abbey ale with yeast esters, pale malt, and sugar, part fruit beer with the cherries very much evident in the aroma, and barrel aged with bourbon and vanilla notes. The flavor somehow works with all these elements in play. Unfortunately the Belgian aspect looses the most. All that is left is some sweet malt and yeasty fruitiness. But the cherries and bourbon makes up for the loss. A cherrie-vanilla bourbon infused drink. Just slightly boozy but I would not guess it is up at 11.80%. The mouthfeel is the weakest aspect of this beer but it still pretty good. Just a little light and overcarbonated. The fizzy carbonation seems inappropriate for the style.

The balance between the oak, bourbon, cherries, is very good, however, there is a lot going on in this beer and the Quadrupel base is slightly lost. Overall, it is a good beer. The high ABV is hidden well and I'm enjoying it more as I drink and as the beer warms. The carbonation is my biggest issue. I would like for it to be slightly more carbonated.","dauss","Jan 22, 2010"

I shared it with a few friends, but honestly, I wouldn't mind finishing a bottle by myself. The aroma was an enticing fig and bourbon mixture than without a doubt, smelled better than any whiskey I'd ever sampled. The flavor is again light on the Belgian notes with mild spice and dried fruit, but it provides a great backbone for a rich and tasty bourbon candy flavor. This quad has some body, but it's still dry and not overly thick. If you ever come across this beer, buy it immediately.","tempest","Jan 08, 2010"
4.08,-4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall. A very pleasing and nicely balanced ale. The blend of wood aged and cherry notes really give this beer a nice complexity without being overbearing. The malt complexity in the flavor seems to develop as you sip and probably goes well beyond my own description. I really enjoy the hint of sour in this beer and I wonder perhaps if brettanomyces has been used somewhere in the process. Though I suspect it's really from the barrel aging. Brett would be a welcome addition to this series however. The qualities of bourbon really don't come out in this beer very well. Considering the name, I was expected a lot more.","DanOLeary","Jan 08, 2010"
4.4,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: This was my first bourbon barrel-aged beer. I was a little skeptical, but ended up very pleased. The bourbon character complements the yeast-heavy beer.

3.64,-14.6,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"OVERALL This would likely improve in the cellar, but I don't know the cherry dominance would dissipate, and that was the main problem I found with this beer. I find it too strong and overpowers the others and detracts from what could be a very smooth and complex beer. There might even be too much going on, generally. It was also too hot, but that could mellow with time. As a quad fan (whatever a quad is?), I was quite excited to try this, but the experience left me a bit underwhelmed. I definitely like Boulevard's Sixth Glass quad much better. I'd try this again, though, but would age it for at least a couple of years.","sprucetip","Jan 06, 2010"

You get a light bourbon tang while the sweetness of the flavors grabs your attention. It cleans up pretty quickly...almost dry. Full flavored, the bourbon fig harvest fruit and cinnamon tastes is quite good. It's really hard too imagine that this is 11.8% ABV...hugely drinkable.

4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a sharp brown color. The head is a firm two inches of foam which recedes slowly into a solid cap of lacing that lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of dates, figs, sweet bourbon, and hints of anise. The taste has a little less bourbon than the aroma, but what it does have is in perfect balance. It begins with dates, figs, anise, and a round sweetness that leads into a beautiful bourbon finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. I really like how the bourbon is a part of the beer without dominating it. I would love to drink this again.","KarlHungus","Feb 01, 2009"

Not much quad left in here, as the flavor is dominated by whiskey and sour fruits. Too sour, with no malt depth. The oak contribution didnt provide much nuance of coconut and vanilla, just funk. Not a beer I enjoy.","Crosling","Jan 09, 2009"

This beer really taught me how to drink quality beers. The sipping fashion. When drank slowly this beer simply glows. When guzzled it's a trademark ale.","ProfessorHops","Jan 03, 2009"
4.54,6.6,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a 750ml, corked and caged into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer poured an orangey, muddy brown with a huge beige head that left some serious lacing as the head receded into just a thin film. The aroma is really complex with oak and bourbon coming through but also vanilla, cherries, a mild citrus aroma, toffee, and some Belgian yeast spiciness. This beer definitely has the most complex aroma of any beer Boulevard has put out to date and one of the more complex aromas of the beers I've tried. The flavor is more in line with the Sixth Glass and other Quads. Fig, date, other dark fruits, brown sugar, green apple, cocoa powder and a bit of cherry are all prevalent but what really sets the flavor apart from other Quads is the oak and bourbon flavors that show up at the end of the taste profile. This is really a superb beer. The mouthfeel is nice a full with a bit of booze that lingers on the palate. This is a great beer. Boulevard has really gone above and beyond with this one.","hwwty4","Jan 03, 2009"

4.58,7.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Hands down the best Quad I have tried. This is unique to every other example I have had of this style. I can thank the fruity spiciness, funky, and sour malt for that. Funky in a good Belgian strong ale kind of way. Wonderful, and highly recommended.","champ103","Dec 30, 2008"
4.2,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and easy going. Carbonation is effervescent, yet not gassy. It's easy drinking for a big beer. The alcohol is noticeable in the flavor, but for such a big beer, it's really not a nuisance. This is pretty damn good. But for the high price tag, I'll probably not revisit this any time soon.","Bighuge","Dec 29, 2008"
3.7,-13.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall Impression - This is a good beer, but not the most fantastic example of the style. I think that with a year or three of aging that this beer would be much better. Much of the more negative qualities of this beer are simply because it's still young. My recommendation is to pick up a bottle or two, and let them sit for at least one year.","Hullabaloo2","Dec 28, 2008"
4.2,-1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The alcohol at 11.8% is powerful, but really, only in the nose and a some warmness in the swallow. First sip you get some tartness from the cherries, but it's not anywhere close to making you think this is a fruit beer. It's more of a highlight in the taste which then segues into the oakiness. After that, you get the bourbon taste. Each sip is a mouthful and this is best enjoyed on a cold winter day sipping.","baha773","Dec 28, 2008"

4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Sampled from magnum bottle, thanks to Carter at Midtown in Tulsa. This quad pours mahogany with a creamy tan head and with sheets of lacing. Pleasant raisin, cherry and vanilla/oak aroma. Balanced. Dark sugar, vanilla, oak, dominate the flavor. I love the fact that it's not too sweet like many American versions of the style. Seems like great yeast management. In that regard, the yeast character is present - a nice spiciness with some dark fruits - but those elements are restrained. Full body is made 'digestible' by a lower FG and moderately-high carbonation. Warming, but not hot. Excellent.","Bdc","Dec 15, 2008"

Smells of cherries and a little bourbon (surprise!). Tastes great, although the bourbon is less pronounced than I expected. The cherry and bourbon flavors are well balanced with the malty quad base. Medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Hides the 11.8% alcohol very well, though there is a little heat on the finish. Very drinkable.","thehand","Dec 09, 2008"
