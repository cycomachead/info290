The beer poured a rich amber...maybe dark amber (was tough to tell with the darker room I was in) there was a sudsy head that dissipated and did not leave a lace.  The scent was typical of most Quads...not overpowering.  The taste was slightly tart with good Belgian sugar to balance it out.  The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall it was decent...and I am not a quad guy.","WoodBrew","Mar 29, 2015"

The initial pour produced mostly all foam despite using a proper pour technique although it eventually settled into decent balance of body with head. The smell was really low-key although it had a nice variety of scents. The flavor and mouthfeel both seemed rather weak all-around, especially with the overly fizzy carbonation feel. Subsequent sips reminded me more of a bitter cola than a deep, balanced, and complex beer. Fair but certainly meet my expectations for a quad.","beergoot","Nov 11, 2014"

Sweet, malty, boozey nose with lots of brown bread and dark fruit along with hints of toffee, nuts, and subtle chocolate. The taste follows suit with rich dark fruit and sweet caramel malt along with hints of prunes, licorice, brown bread, tea, leather, subtle chocolate, and booze. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy with a surprising amount of fizzy carbonation still present for such an old beer. The boozey finish I remembered from fresher bottles has become much smoother with age. Overall, this has held up nicely in the cellar with only a slight criticism of a bit too much sweetness.","beerdrifter","Jul 09, 2014"

Pours very hazy extremely dark brown color with a 1 finger foamy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apple, pear, prune, caramel, molasses, chocolate, toast, pepper, clove, earth, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of raisin, prune, caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, toffee, clove, earth, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, chocolate, toffee, earth, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Excellent balance and complexity of flavors with good depth; no cloying flavors after the finish at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale! Very nice depth and complexity; and quite smooth to sip on. No idea on the age of this bottle; but I would have to say it probably is fairly old and it definitely holds up well. This is a very enjoyable sipper.","superspak","Oct 25, 2012"

Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit thinner than I would have expected for the style and ABV, but I assume the uppity carbonation level probably has something to do with that.

It tasted very sweet too, with sugary caramel and creamy yeast dominating, followed by nutty and wheat malts and prune, and a bit of cinnamon and alcohol. It was slightly thick and silky with moderate carbonation at first that subsided over time, and a sweet & sour aftertaste. Overall this was delicious, complex, and delicious. It had fantastic depth to the flavor that I'm sure I missed part of. It had a nice, smooth body too. The alcohol wasn't very strong considering the 12%, so this was quite easy to drink. This was my favorite Belgian ale while still cold, since I usually need to let them warm up and mellow out before I can fully enjoy them. But this was immediately great, and only improved as it warmed. An all-around solid brew fresh, and I could imagine this further improving with age.","Pencible","Mar 30, 2009"

4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"BB 23-03-08. Nice, ultrathick, big bubbeld yellowish head and very darkbrown beercollor. Nose is ultra malty, straw and caramel, litle roast, raisins, oak and explosive alcohol amounts. Good but IMO bombastic. Taste is also very strong malted, sweet but not overdone in this one, in composite of the alcohol that burns like whiskey together with the partly roasty genuiatly dosed bitterness. Carramellic coffee is what I would discripe this one and not high but still too high dosed carbonisation is strange in this extra stout like quadruppel. Recomendable IMO but take your time for it.","paterlodie","Nov 01, 2005"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"dark brown -- aromas of maple, oak, molasses, raisin, cherry cough drops, vanilla and sweet brown spices. Robust flavors of brandied, dried fruits, mashed nuts and old vintage port. The fizz is minor. The effect is dessert-like. I'll save this for later this evening.","putnam","Feb 10, 2005"
4.47,9.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"the color is the deepest, darkest brown wood that you can imagine. light tan head thayed throughout the whole beer. Aroma is chocolatey, alcohol, spicy, yeasty. This smells like an adult chocolate milk shake. Taste is malty, bittersweet chocolate, dry. Lots of carbonation for a 12% beer. Tough pour with a lot of yeast in the glass.","kennyo","Nov 20, 2004"

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"It is a dark ruby-brown color with a big tan head. The aroms is spicy and yeasty. It is very malty with some fruity esters and a slight bitter choclate taste. It finishes with flowery hops, though the bitterness is restrained. There is also a peppery spice that helps balance out the malts. A delicious beer.","ark57","Mar 11, 2004"
4.4,8.1,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Turbid deep bister hue. Thick, dogged, uniform beige head leaves attractive lace. Deep, dark chocolate and minty ethanol waft to the nose at first. Ensuing is a combination of mild banana esters, black licorice and clove. Cocoa presence becomes more pronounced as the brew breathes. Relatively clean, but quite seductive aromawise. Dominant in flavor is a rich, semisweet chocolate and alcohol derived black pepper presence. Actual alcohol harshness is virtually absent. Esters are subdued, but multifaceted, with seemingly equal proportions of ripe plum, banana and bubblegum complementing chocolate character. Clove seemlessly emerges after a deliberation, adding an herbal twang. Dextrinous in body, with a mouthfeel one notch shy of viscous and creamy. Toffeeish dark candi sugar hints arise late, adding additional depth to residual sweetness. Finishes simply sweet with chocolate cookie hints melding with ethanol warmth. A delicious Dark Strong with pronounced, but well controlled chocolate character and just enough yeast derived nuances to pull it all together. Ranks amongst the very most drinkable high gravity brews I've encountered thus far. Highly recommended. Props to AKSmokedPorter for the delivery.","marc77","Feb 05, 2004"

4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear but deep dark garnet with a nice cream-colored head. The smell of raisons, yeast, and light spices and alcohol bellow from the frothy foam. It has a sweetness that is obvious from the beginning and slides into the raison, fruit, spices, and light hops. What is simply amazing is that at 12%abv, it is not as apparent as you would think although there is a warming feeling that comes over you. It is light bodied and finishes quite sweet. Somewhat bold and tasty! Op uw gezonheid!","BeerAngel","Aug 31, 2003"

4.37,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Deep garnet tinged murly brown color. Fluffy, creamy dense tan head, bubbles up and fades fast. Tiniest bit of lacing around the edge of the glass. Nice sweet carmel smell matched with hints of maple syrup and vanilla. Taste is a supersmooth combination of the above with stronger vanilla notes to compliment. Sweetness is very present, almost hints of maple syrup. Streak of flowery hops whispers by, and leaves you wondering. Then a carmel and sticky to finish. Alcohol is only noticable at the very very end, with just a hint of alcohol burn. Medium bodied, slick slightly syrupy but so smooth. 12 % Abv sneeks up on you, watch out, but give it a try !","StevieW","Mar 14, 2003"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Quite a change from their other beers that are all golden to orange in color, this ones dark and brooding with a monstrous head, frothy in texture, beige in color and as it degrades, leaves a nice sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is malt sweet, plummish, hints of yeast and even some caramel, well thats the way this old honker smells it. Start sweet, loads of malt, top middling in feel to the palate. Finish is mildly acidic, hops are delectable in their spicy presence, the aftertaste alcohol bitter, dry and long lasting, quite a Belly Warmer to boot, not meant for the Light Weights, its a BA Beer.","Gusler","Mar 07, 2003"

3.53,-13.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I don't like the label, it looks rotted, but it really doesn't matter in reality. It pours deep reddish-brown with a foamy white head. The head bubbled down into a denser layer that held. It has an orange liquor smell on the nose. It has a strong bitterness across the tongue but leaves a slightly sweet aftertaste. It was thick in the mouth and I found it drinkable although you'll certainly feel it after a while. Curious to have it off of tap. I'll definatly revisit.","packetknife","Mar 06, 2003"
