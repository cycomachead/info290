Cheap rubber/plastic cork provided (which I could barely pull out) for such a highly esteemed brewery.  Surprised at how flat this is.  A pleasant quaff nonetheless.  Very easy drinking.  But has this quad fully succeeded the intention.  I was expecting more for the money spent but oh well.  Overall a ho hum quad and a basic meh!","joeseppy","Feb 08, 2015"

A bit thinner than it's counterpart, this version smells and tastes like it's heavier on the alcohol while remaining the same.

Taste is much the same with toffee, candied fruit, tawny port, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness on the palate with each sip.

The "cork" was made of some plastic that was very difficult to remove- I had to use a 16" set of Knipex pliers. Once I got past this issue I was excited about the pour. But disappointed that there was not even a millimeter of foam. This was seriously deficient in carbonation for me. I almost wanted to throw it out and drink something else. I did get through it and the taste was not so bad as it had complexity and flavor going for it. It didn't look pretty to me in a tulip glass-- Too thick, no bubbles, looked like flat cola to me. I haven't seen any Batch 11 reviews here so I thought this might add to the many reviews. Could be Batch 11 is particularly bad.","notreallyme","Jun 02, 2013"

Pours hazy and cloudy dark reddish brown color with a small dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, toast, oak, clove, molasses, light red wine, candi sugar, brown bread, vanilla, light chocolate, light peat, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity and balance of malt and fruity esters with moderate oak barrel presence. Taste of big raisin, prune, toffee, toast, caramel, molasses, clove, brown bread, oak, light wine, candi sugar, light peat, light chocolate, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, toffee, toast, caramel, molasses, brown bread, oak, clove, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big malt flavors with moderate fruity/spicy esters; with moderate oak presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible oak aged Quad! Tons of complexity and well balanced flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. Insanely enjoyable stuff; definitely worth enjoying again in the future, even for the high price of the bottle.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

Burying your nose in the tulip gives a really nice, inviting aroma that hides the alcohol of a 10.0% beer. You get the typical date, fig sweetness of a quad. Quaffing it yields an unbelievably mellow flavor, and since this is not one of the older variations, the oak aging seems to have done a trick. I didn't get any alcohol burn until it got all the way to my stomach, likely as a result of not having eaten in a while. Otherwise, this is super silky smooth. I didn't know that this was made with Malbec wine casks until I went to look up some details due to catching a tannic taste from my red wine drinking days. My suspicions were confirmed online. It has a pretty light body, and was not as thick as I thought (or wanted) it to be. However, the overall flavor was excellent, and I'm glad I popped the cork on this before the weather got too warm.","yankeepride","Apr 29, 2013"

The oak is dominant in the taste as well, but with much more of the white wine character emerging from the barrels. Also getting hints of caramel, vanilla, booze, butterscotch, brown sugar, and just a faint touch of chocolate on the finish. The mouthfeel has very low carbonation, almost to the point where it seems flat, but not in a bad way. Slightly syrupy with a subtle warming alcohol burn on the finish.

4.25,-0.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,""BATCH 7 is blended in June 2011 and is the first batch (of two) that has matured in old whiskey barrels. These barrels come from different whiskey distilleries such as Bowmore, Tamdhu, Strathspey and Laphroaig (Johnstons). The aroma's of the whiskeys have an obvious impact on the final flavor. This flavor is remarkable and clearly different from those of previous batches. Peat and burnt are more present, while wood and wood tannins are less obvious to spot. But the warming effect of the full, robust flavor the whiskey barrels passed on to our already beautiful Quadrupel, makes this batch maybe even the most tasty brewed to date."","AgentMunky","May 11, 2012"

Served in a Dogfish Head Signature glass, the beer pours a murky amber/brown color with about an inch light tan head that didn't stay around for too long. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is malty and sweet, it smells like brown sugar, oak, caramel malt, dark fruit, Belgian yeast, and port. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some banana and dark fruit flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Overall I think it's a good but not great beer. At $14.99 a bottle I probably wouldn't buy it again, but even then I still think it's worth trying.","bluejacket74","Dec 09, 2011"

Maybe the barrel was going neutral by the time it was filled with beer. This bottle is over a year old, but in my experience, barrel flavors don't really mellow over time. The yeast character and sweet malt are the primary flavors. I don't know that it delivers the goods for the price (~$15 per 375), but it is a good beer.

La Trappe quad is a very bold and flavorful brew, so itâs not surprising that the barrel had to make room for itself somewhere.

The aroma is a little bit let fruity and more wooden which makes sense but I was hoping that some of those fruit aromas would have been preserved in here. There a slightly sweet and sour aroma coming off it as well. I don't really get vanilla though. The taste has a little bit of vanilla but it's not nearly as lively as the original version.

Aromas of light oak, dark fruits (plums, figs, dates) and caramel. Medium bodied, with dried fruits, raisins and toffee.","emmasdad","Apr 20, 2011"
4.37,1.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,"(D)- An awesome Quad. A beer that is usually fairly rich to begin with, the oak aging really puts this on a whole other level of richness and strength for the style.","sweemzander","Apr 09, 2011"
4.5,4.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a damn tasty beer. Tastes like it smells but with burnt sugar, hints of maple, walnut, black truffel and black tea. Really datey and pruney. The oak is nice, adds a soft round mouthfeel to the beer as well as some tannin from the wood. A good bit of vanilla on the finish really helps the drinkability and keeps the 10% at bay. Delicious beer.","mcallister","Apr 08, 2011"
3.92,-8.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: A unique take on a quad with the barrel treatment. Takes it away from quad territory and almost into the old ale realm.","callmemickey","Apr 01, 2011"
3.57,-16.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Well, that was a bit of a disappointment. The barrel-aging adds a bit of interest, but the underlying brew just doesn't have the complexity of other top-tier quads. It was, at least, interesting with some parmesan.","Phelps","Mar 31, 2011"
4.1,-4.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Snagged this bottle up at Julios tonight on my way home. Poured in to a snifter, the color is a nice rose, with a ring of lace, and tiny chunks of yeast floating here and there. The smell is of peach nectar, honey, alcohol, and stone fruit. Taste is pretty damn close to the nose, with a nice lively carbonation. The oak barrel aging is apparent, but not too over the top. Same with the alcohol, definitely noticeable, but not overkill. Interesting to see a Trappist brewery use barrel aging. La Trappe Quad is one of my favorites from the monks anyway...wish I had a bottle of regular Quad to compare. Either way, damn tasty.","jamie2dope","Mar 24, 2011"
4.39,2.3,4,5,4.5,3.5,4,"This one is decentlyhot, like a typical La Trappe Quad, but a bit more rounded from the barrels and the length of the aging though.","crossovert","Mar 19, 2011"

4.47,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a murky reddish brown, small head that diminished down to a lingering ring. Smell actually reminds me of a sweet red wine. Very fruity, some oaky wine notes, pretty interesting and quite nice. Taste of this one is very smooth. The oak is pretty subtle, and the year in the barrel has no doubt mellowed this one out quite a bit. Definitely some tannic wine qualities, along with some fruity, estery flavors. It finishes with a slight bitterness and a lingering wine taste. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than I would hope, but the lower carbonation level works pretty well. I would say the drinkability is pretty high, but with a quality brew like this I am taking my time. Overall this beer is definitely an interesting take on the original. I would love to try all the different batches. A little pricey, but a unique and tasty brew.","khumbard","Mar 05, 2011"
4.09,-4.7,3,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer feels a little raw but the oak adds another layer of flavor and works well with the style. The oak is strong in this one.","Gmann","Mar 04, 2011"
3.5,-18.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it's a pretty good beer, though the huge banana character was unexpected and not very quad-like.","largadeer","Feb 24, 2011"
4.14,-3.5,2.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is pretty good but I can't recommend for the price, way to expensive, especially when you don't really taste a barrel aged quad.","jrallen34","Feb 23, 2011"

3.98,-7.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"For the first time (when discussing a Koningshoeven beer) can I begin to talk about some of the finer intangibles that separate Trappist Ales from most Abbey Ales. Notice that any mention of oak-aging is slight, as this character does a great job of smoothening the beer and adding subtle complexity without over-stating it. Although the alcohol could exercise some restraint in mouthfeel, the beer has the magical sweetness in taste that translate to succulent dryness late; and while offering many complexities that are difficult to describe... it is Trappist quality through and through. Definately the pick of the litter when considering the Koningshoeven portfolio. ...reminds me of a green Rochefort 6.","BEERchitect","Feb 17, 2011"
4.57,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is a Batch 1 bottle corked 07/10, serial KO3F10, procured from Tanakaya Beer Store in Meijiro, Tokyo at 2070 yen; a treasure unearthed and a clear purchase decision. This is taken shortly after my 2009 La Trappe Quadrupel and quick comparisons reveal a mellowed sweetness and phenolic nature as mentioned and the introduction of vinous, oak flavors. The fruity nature was also less succulent and felt more "matured" generally. Very interesting and will definitely revisit this batch and the other 3 batches in the 2010 vintage.","basica","Feb 07, 2011"
4.35,1.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A light oak smell and taste. Good drinkable with a very good aftertaste. I am very surprised by this one because in my opinion this abbey brews not the best abbey beers. This one however is a hit!","Brabander","Feb 04, 2011"
4.32,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D : light alcohol taste from the barrels ( little whisky touch ) very drinkable","beerpirates","Jan 10, 2011"
4.34,1.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D - This is very good, although it smells and looks more like a tripel in some ways. I'm curious to try Batch 2 or 3, as I get a sense that they are all quite different. It's a bit too boozy for mass quantities, but I'd love to work through a bottle over a few hours.","MasterSki","Dec 15, 2010"
4.31,0.5,3.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Glad I was able to lay hands on probably the rarest of all extant trappist ales, brewed in small quantities and at the time of review available only at the store of monastic brewery. 375 ml bottle, Batch 2, K28610, into 180 ml Chimay chalice. Beige, almost instantly dissipating head atop of clear amber body that gets hazier with additional pours. Honeyish aroma with oak, apple, and well restrained alcohol apart from apple brandy notes. Flavor is prevalent fruity tartness of apple accompanied by some alcohol warmth and slight astringency from oaky notes. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall, a very decent, well mellowed quad with bridled alcohol that I often find quite disturbing in La Trappe brews.","crnipeter","Nov 18, 2010"
5,16.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Looks rich in color, bronze cant see thru it. Smells like caramel apple pie. Taste is complex....has a bitter bite sorta like sour apple and coffee with honey and a tangy aftertaste. I would definitely drink another...its one of my favorites. A great addition to any cellar.","Frothboss","Nov 05, 2010"
4.89,14,4,5,5,4.5,5,"edit: just gave a higher score... I'm drinking my next one right now, after one month in 50Â° fridge... the taste is already perfect. Unbelievable! What a balance, no alcohol in there what so ever!","yapi","Oct 12, 2010"
4.6,7.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall: A very nice la Trappe beer, better than the regular la Trappe quad. As mentioned before, the sweetness in the taste was a bit too much, making this beer a bit simple. Compared to the bottled version, the tap version is very smooth and easy to drink. The bottled version is still a bit too sharp and needs at least another year before it can be fully appreciated.An interesting experiment for sure, can wait to try it again in a few years, then this beer should be magnificent!","rvdoorn","Aug 03, 2010"
4.85,13.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Had this beer while in the Netherlands. Surprisingly good! (I thought I was ordering the Westmalle) Subtle sweet flavorings of caramel, and some spices, but hard to describe. Not much to say for the smell, though. Honestly though, this one should be up there with the Rocheforts.","Machinehead","Jul 16, 2010"
