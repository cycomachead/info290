Smoke, chocolate, black berries - none of those is present in those quads. Not much of dried fruits, like in VW12, R10 and SB12. None of the honey and candies, like in La Trappe. More bitter. Also, much darker. I'd say it's something between BA Imp. Stout and Belgian strong dark ales. Very original beer, one of the best Belgian.","hansavijaticar","Jan 17, 2015"

4.69,9.1,4.25,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,"Snagged this bottle off a shelf at Dawson’s in Severna Park, hiding behind some other brews while home for the holidays. 2009 bottle poured to a Unibroue tulip on 1/9/14. The bottle says only 3,000 bottles of this made. Not a bad find! Pours a murky dark brownish purple with a small off white or khaki colored head. Beautiful aroma of plums, super ripe pears, raisins, tobacco, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, lots of beautiful mellow oak with a nice helping of booze that makes me almost think this was bourbon barrels. Flavor of raisins, plums, brown sugar, some warming booze, light cocoa, toffee, tobacco, and much more spice than would be expected from the aroma. The oak dries out the finish a bit and keeps this a very smooth and mellow brew despite the alcohol and spice present. The mouthfeel is heavy, like huge imperial stout heavy, and yet has low to medium carbonation. This was pretty freaking awesome.","BMMillsy","Jan 09, 2014"

Minimal glass lacing with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, molasses, toast, clove, pepper, oak, light roast, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy notes with moderate oak presence. Taste of raisin, prune, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, clove, pepper, oak, brown bread, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, toffee, oak, clove, pepper, brown bread, light roast, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy flavors; with moderate oak presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic oak aged quadrupel. Big complexity and great balance of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 23, 2013"

It could also be rounded out due to the age itself, but regardless, it is a bit more complex than the regular version which is saying quite a lot.

I don't get a ton of oak, perhaps a touch of vanilla in the aftertaste but not a huge barrel character from the oak. Mid level carbonation with a bit of a bite.

Raisins, plums, prunes, figs, dates, molasses, caramel, spice, sherry and wood. The taste is fairly sweet but ends with a dry oak flavor. Lush mouthfeel that, again, mostly dries out in the end. Just makes me hunger all the more for the Grande Reserva. Edit: I later tried this beer against the GR and, while my scores for this beer dropped slightly, I definitely preferred it to the GR, which was a bit disappointing.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

It pours from the bottle with a warm chestnut brown color that is light enough that the many floating specks of sediment are easily identified. A big, foamy beige head helps to redeem the appearance, though. The aroma is sadly a bit muted, but it does convey some nice notes of dark brown sugar and dried grains. The flavor is certainly more assertive, with moderately rich, dry toffee-like sweetness, some mild floral and dried herb characteristics, and some slightly tangy yeast. The medium body and light, fine carbonation do a very nice job lightening the profile without taking away substance. Overall, this isn't a standard setter for a Belgian quad and lacks the same dry, fruity depth of the best in this class, but it is mouth-pleasing and quite a bit more drinkable than it's 10% ABV would suggest.","devilben02","Jan 15, 2013"

Color is an opaque brown in the balloon part of the glass and in the narrrower part a hazy/cloudy amber orange red with some particulates and some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is malt, yeast, roast, fruit, red wine. Flavor is like nose, very nicely balanced, with bitter, sweet, and tang all pronounced, yet harmonious.

I love side-by-side tastings, as they really give you an opportunity to see how aging or barrel-aging affects a base beer. This one did not disappoint. Notes of dark fruit, molasses, honey, subtle spice, caramel, even some port. There is truly no other beer like Pannepot in the world - I love it.

Taste is of raisins and prunes, brown sugar, caramel, and malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink.

Pours deep crimson with some expected floaties, light carbonation and a thin cap of light tan head that retains throughout and leaves some lacing. Smells malty with fermented dark sugars (raisins, plums, cherries, blue/blackberries), spicy/phenolic yeast and some fruity alcohol. Tastes of spice, sweet citrus, raisins and prunes, dates?, and chalky yeast. A little sweet, with some bitterness underneath, and a light winey character that wants to contribute oak, but can't quite push it through. It is very thick and viscous, with low carbonation and a mild tannic dryness. As it warms it lightens and the carbonation increases, which is odd. Not terribly complex, but very tasty, with a pleasant, but restrained oak flavor. Quite an enjoyable brew that is very easy to drink.

It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one wasn't quite as smooth as the Old Fisherman's Ale with similar age on it, but was still quite nice. The alcohol on this one definitely made itself present on the followthrough without doubt.

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2008. Deep toffee colour with a tan cap of fine bubbles. Nice lacing, decent head retention. Great aroma. Bready and toasty malts, earthy, prunes, raisins, almost a spicy wood character, light alcohol. Nice flavour too. A little sugary but far from cloying, caramel and molasses, with more of a fresh plum fruitiness and less of a prune and fig dried fruit character. Honey, spices, and alcohol were all mild and balanced, as was a hint of oak flavour and astringency. Medium plus body with lowish, well integrated carbonation that made it feel a bit lighter. Overall this was a really well balanced beer, very tasty and quite drinkable for a quad.","DrJay","Jan 15, 2011"

Head is half an inch, loose, off-white and embedded with tiny ringlets. Head quickly disperses into a solid skim and a frothy band around the edges of the bowl. Some spots and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose is tannic, expresses some ethanol, dark fruit and a trace of oak, which was much more pungent off the cap pop, but is much more diffuse in the glass. Taste follows nose; however, ethanol character is not really present in the flavor profile and oak character all but disappears. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation and some very minor, residual alcohol heat at the finish. A very good Quad - great balance and a well-hidden abv contributes to its exceptional drinkability. Not sure how much aging would enhance the experience on this one, but it might be worth securing an additional bottle to sit on for a few years.","Jwale73","Nov 25, 2010"

Only slightly sweet, caramel malts with a touch of bitterness and milk chocolate coffee. Doesn't have the characteristic quad yeast flavor i was expecting.

This one has a soft pour, as an aged ale should, relatively calm, russet brown. Definitely picking up plenty of oak in the nose, a nice layer. All the typical Pannepot flavor is there, but the barreling and aging and wood have mellowed it out quite a bit. Very nice. Layers of sweet spiced plum, raisin, rum, cake, nice matlyness and depth. Leathery. Velvety but slightly thinned out mouthfeel from the usual version. This is an outstanding beer - quite different really from the standard Pannepot. Not necessarily better or worse, but a different beast. Having sampled the regular Pannepot, the Reserva, the Pannepeut (Danish), and the Pannepot Wild, I have to say my favorite is the old standard issue, with a good year or two of age on it.

Some brown bread and mild alcohol can also be picked up on as it warms. Big blast of candied sugar in the beginning of the taste, followed by more dark fruit nectar, quick hit of hops and carbonation right toward the finish, and a lingering dryness at the end. The body of this beer is big and in your face, and filled with complexities. Drinkability is excellent for a sipper like this. Allow this one to unfold for sure. I would also recommend pairing this with food. Last time I matched this up with a Filet Mignon, which was nice, however I would personally recommend some kind of creamy blue cheese.

There's a faint red wine-like tartness, and a odd mineral aroma beneath the surface. On the palate it's fruity and slightly tart, like a semi-ripe blackberry. A big chocolate malt flavor makes up the foundation, with subtler notes of tannins, minerals and figs beneath that. The finish is semi-dry and semi-tart with a light astringency. The full body and chocolatey, almost roasty malt profile make this an unusual quad, and a fairly good one.","largadeer","May 20, 2009"

Some phenol spices with tones of leather, wood, sun scorched soil, raisins and dark fruit all come through on the nose. With first sip you immediately take a step back and say wow!, this beer is something special. First off I have to say that this is probably the best I've ever had a 10% alcohol hidden, and that is totally a complement. Rich toffee and bready malts are mixed with dark fruits for a wonderful complexity. Creamy smooth with lengthy richness and soft spices all through the palate. Carbonation is just right and carries all the flavors well. Oak is classic in this one and really adds maturity. Mouthfeel is oh so lovely and slightly thick. You would really have to stop me from drinking this beer all night, but at some time you could remind me that it is $23 a bottle and 10% alcohol.","SPLITGRIN","Mar 20, 2009"

The taste is a little less complex than the original version with a little less spiciness and a heavy dose of grape sweetness. There's a little bit of cola flavor in there as well on top of a roasted malt base with some caramel tones. The mourhfeel is medium bodied with a little less carbonation than the original. There is a little less sour kick on this one and, for me, leads to a slightly more drinkable beer.
