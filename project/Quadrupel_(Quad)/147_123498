4.27,13.3,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"From the 22 oz bomber into a cervoise, this one is a clear dark ruby/chestnut color with lots of bubbly precipitation fuelling a solid off white head which is initially about 1-2 fingers slowly fading to a thick collar and spotty cap with nice lacing.  Nose of sweet dark fruits and sweet malt.  Mouth is semi-chewy and quite bubbly for style.  Flavors of big fruits up front, hints of sweet slightly smokey malt, a bit of alcohol burn on the back.  Finishes on a bitter, fairly strong hops note.  Feels very “American-quad-ish” and not nearly as subtle as Belgian quads and other similar styles. Not bad at all but nowhere near the level of the best in style.  No doubt would benefit from cellaring.","jettjon","Mar 01, 2015"

Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy reddish/brown color with about a half inch tan head that didn't stay around for very long.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums, figs), brown sugar, sweet spices, cloves and some dark bread.  I think the taste pretty much follows the aroma, but there's also some apple and a weird herbal bitter (kinda like a Ricola cough drop) finish noticeable.  That bitterness bugged me at first, but luckily it didn't bother me for long.  Guess I just got used to it!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall I liked this brew, definitely worth trying!  $8.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jan 09, 2015"

4.09,8.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Bomber poured into a tulip, another brew from the initial wave of Stone offerings to arrive in Alberta. I enjoy reading the wordy tangential musings on these labels. This brew is on the light side color wise, a bronze amber with a small amount of frothy beige foam in top. Does leave a nice thick lacing on the glass. Aroma is rich and sweet, Christmas pudding-like with some toasted grains, dark fruits, brown sugar, and cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger all nicely melded together. Dangerously smooth and drinkable, comes across as light-medium bodied (its easy to forget that even the biggest Trappist/abbey ales are still supposed to err on the side of drinkable, to hear the monks talk). Gentle carbonation. Malts evoke honeyed breakfast cereal and a little chocolate pudding, molasses, and a puff of dark roast wheat. Getting a decent dose of orchard and tropical fruit on the nose and palate, mango (!), orange, and poached pears. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and white pepper spice round out the flavor profile. Rich sweet taste but does not become cloying, with more emphasis on malts and fruity hops than classic Belgian spicy phenols. Certainly a unique take on the style, with west coast hop flourishes and a rounded sweetness that can be less apparent in the true Belgian examples. Bold like most Stone beers yet with a pleasing subtle complexity.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 01, 2014"

It definitely hits some totally Belgian conventions, but it's also kind of apparent that it was conceived by a brewery which generally specializes in abundantly bitter and hoppy brews, as there are some surprising IPA traits in here. In the end, I'm damn glad I tried it, because it's not only flavorful and aromatic, but distinctly different from any other beer I've sampled. It's an interesting little bastard child of traditional Belgian ales and American ales that have been hopped to hell. This is the bastard Stone WON'T acknowledge, hahaha!","Kuaff","Aug 11, 2014"

Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toast, spicy rye, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toast, spicy rye, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast/rye spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toast, spicy rye, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent specialty grain Quad style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hops flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. The spicy rye-like triticale grain added a very nice amount of spiciness on the finish which I really liked. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 08, 2014"

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a good and slightly unique example of the style, it had most of the aspect that I would expect from a Quad, but in typical Stone Style it seems like the flavors are bolder than they are traditionally, but they still retain nice balance. This beer had good drinkability it was smooth, the alcohol was hidden nicely, it was almost slightly cloying, rich, a little silky, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, half the bottle might be the perfect amount for me, but I think I could take out a whole bottle if I really wanted to. What I like the most about this beer was that it was just a good overall beer and it didn't really have any weak points. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but I do wish that the Tritcale was a little more noticeable, I think I picked it up in the aroma, but that same aspect didn't stick out to me in the taste. I would buy this beer again, if I see another one I would for sure grab it and it throw it in the cellar to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or people who just like malty beers in general. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I haven't had the greatest luck when it comes to Stone and Belgian style beers, but this one turned out to be a pretty good beer and I have to say that I enjoyed a lot more than the past few other Stone Releases. It isn't my favorite Stone beer, but it is one of the better American made Quads I've had and I would say it's my favorite beer I've had in this series since I didn't care too much for the Grapefruit beer. Good job guys, this was one enjoyable beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Aug 01, 2014"

Aroma is rather rich, suggesting plums and currants. The unique grain used here is immediately recognizable as contributing an unfamiliar flavor to this beer. There's not a lot of hops masking the peculiar grain bill in this Quad. There's not a lot of the yeasty flavor distinctive in Belgian 3s and 4s. What there is is the distinctive sweet note of Belgian Candi sugar. But I'm actually finding the flavor a little bit thin, considering there's clearly so much going on here, gravity wise, it leaves me wanting more in the middle of the palate. More that specialty barley malts, or conventional rye malts, would have provided. But this beer is actually intensely drinkable, and smooth despite it's 9.3 per cent ABVs. The carbonation is also thankfully low, which helps.","hreb","Jul 26, 2014"

I am in the midst of wondering if I should buy another bottle or two, rare for me with bombers anyway.

3.87,2.7,3.5,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured a semi-clear reddish brown with abundant ruby red highlights when held to light. No head to speak of and no lacing. An interesting look for a Belgian Strong Dark, not the best through. Scents of syrupy dark fruit, including prune, raisin and dried cherries, cherry and apricot juice notes are also present alongside smokey malt, rich, dark bread, a bit of an earthy rye spice, and a noticeable alcohol presence in the background. A very rich, boozy and malty aroma with a high amount of dark fruit. Spiciness and smokiness are the elements that arw not true to style, though the intensity of the aromas, particularly those reminiscent of cherries are greater than in the Trappists Rochefort 10 and Chimay Blue and in the abbey-style St. Bernardus Abt. 12. This creates a bigger, bolder aroma than is typical for the style, befitting Stone. Flavor begins semi-sweet with flavors of liquor-soaked dark fruit, including prune, raisin and fig alongside rich, burnt caramel-like malt, a bit of a smokiness, slight hints of burnt toast and boozy undertones. This moves into a semi-sweet flavor reminiscent of dried apricots and cherries with ample alcohol flavors and some sweet, dark bread, smoky and caramel malt flavors. Finish is semi-dry with notes of spicy rye, burnt toast, alcohol, smoked malt and dark fruit. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of burnt toast, alcohol, toasted malt and spicy rye. A very rich, complex flavor profile. In many respects it is rather true to style, though the burnt toast and rye spice are both unique twists. It is also rather boozy, even for a Belgian Strong Dark. Still quite good and very unique. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and sticky with moderate-high carbonation that is present, but not prickly and a present, though not overwhelming alcohol warmth. A very good sipping beer mouthfeel that is quite easy to drink. Overall this is a good attempt at doing something different with a quadrupel style Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The aroma and flavor are fairly true to tradition in many respects, but they add small things that change the overall character and make the beer quite unique without ruining the overall balance. The mouthfeel supports this and lends the beer quite nicely to sipping. A good twist on a classic style, well worth trying.","Auraan","Jul 14, 2014"

Flavors are heavy fruit forward, with date and fig, and an herbal overtone, dark and grassy, along with solid spice profiles, and a hint of yeasty funk. Booze notes throughout, too. Solid brew.

Sticky, thick, slow sipping, there is a touch of booze in this beer. The yeast keeps it smooth and there is a mild sugary sweetness, pretty much caramel and maybe candi sugar, with some dark fruit flavors like fig and maybe raisin, and a touch of citric notes with orange and floral, clove spiciness. The triticale has no flavor presence in this beer, at least to me, although from other reviews this could be the floral spiciness I am getting.

Aroma of mild caramel malt, apple family fruit, Belgian yeast, mild dark stone fruit; sweet. Flavor starts with dark dried fruit, coriander, rye sourness, brown sugar. Transitions to a slightly overspiced odd grain flavor, probably the triticale that kind of reminded me of the lightly vegetal flavor in gluten free beers, finishes with an interesting but somewhat unbalanced spiciness from the rye and Belgian spices. Medium, nearly syrupy body with light carbonation. An interesting experiment and a passable quad style ale, but not comparable to the traditional flavors. Works as an odd, spicy, dark fruit Belgian style ale. This grew on me as I drank it and started appreciating the flavors for the non-traditional element they represented. I wouldn't get this again if in the mood for a quad, but definitely wouldn't mind tasting it again. Pleasant way to find out what triticale would taste like in a beer. They need a bit of quality control on the process, I got a small tuft of tribble fur in my glass.","LiquidAmber","Jun 25, 2014"

A bit of spice, citrus, and alcohol were present too, along with mild bitterness, but definitely in the background (at least until the finish). Decent texture, medium/full body with moderate/low carbonation. I enjoyed it and thought it was a decent beer.","DrJay","Jun 20, 2014"

Fine speckled lacing left behind as it dwindles, smoking a big cigar from Nicaragua towards the end of this beer that I will give pairing notes to as the beer review goes. Aroma deep vine ripened dark colored grapes, raisin sweetness, very much the type of beer I like with my cigars...sweet complex and earthy. With a dark wheat base it looks like from the triticale nomenclature. The flavor is perfect vine ripened fruit, dark plums, raisins, exponential malt on the spectrum of fruit profiles, limited acidity enough to balance it out big Belgian yeast notes bready slightly spiced a perfect combination this is really good and will only get better with age. Mouthfeel is full bodied even full fermented carbonation levels, with full on fruit notes bringing out each burst of flavor with alcoholic presence available with each sip. Overall, I'm in love with the whole bottle this beer is going to age explicitly right now it's drinking just fine can't wait to try more of this one!!!","WVbeergeek","Jun 19, 2014"

The taste and smell does not betray the faithful at all. If you close you eyes and drink, you would see the truth, it is classic but only a nice different, it is a triple friend plus, well covered with a rust that never sleeps, it delivers on Taste. Thank you for thinking outside the Belgium box Stone. Of course Belgium beer were born outside the box of Germany and France. I call it a Slavic Triple Belgium beer.

2.96,-21.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Medium body with decent carbonation, a slight syrupy texture and a pleasant spicy rye character that adds life to a somewhat bland/artificial tasting beer. Strong candy sugar sweetness with cloying syrup and faint dark fruit flavor. Some bitterness up front followed by peppery spice, rye and cinnamon. This is followed by some caramel and toffee along with Belgian candi sugar, cough syrup, fig, plum and raisin. The high ABV is very well masked making this beer surprisingly drinkable. Overall, I'm not sure what to think about triticale. The spicy rye character adds interesting complexity but there is hardly any wheat characteristics in this beer and the artificial flavor stand out, taking away from the overall flavor.","corby112","Jun 13, 2014"
