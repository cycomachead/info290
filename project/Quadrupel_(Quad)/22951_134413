It is true that the bourbon barrel taste is virtually non- existant, and I understand people get hacked about that because it usually adds about $2 to the price, when declared.  But when I see ratings at the the level of piss in a bottle, it's way overboard.  This is a good, not great or unique Quad.","stortore","Mar 21, 2015"

4.26,10.4,4.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"The aroma conjures the taste of caramel, creamy vanilla, cranberries, and some nice raisin. A good balance of bourbon, tartness, brown bread, and earthiness summarizes the flavor appropriately. A sweet black cherry addition is very enjoyable. The finish is a tad herbal and sharp, with perhaps a bit of a clove element to it as well. Although the body and mouth feel are moderately light, the warming sensation is heavy... and in this case, it's quite welcome. I don't think anyone who seeks out a BBA Quad is looking for an easy- drinking beer! Overall, this is a memorable entry in the style.  A note to future drinkers and in reference to other reviewers: It's essential to enjoy this beer chilled, slightly above room temperature. If you try to have it right out of the fridge the flavors do not come through properly; you are not getting the correct experience out of it.","Neorebel","Mar 04, 2015"

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 12/16/2014. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing pretty quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, candi sugar, pepper, clove, oak, light bourbon, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark malt, and light-moderate barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, candi sugar, pepper, clove, oak, light bourbon, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, candi sugar, pepper, clove, oak, bourbon, vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of dark malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and light-moderate bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent quadrupel style. All around great complexity and balance of dark malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and light-moderate bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 02, 2015"

Don't get me wrong, it's good, and for a lot of breweries, it would be the best in their portfolio; but relative to the high bar CS have set for themselves, it leaves a little to be desired.

4.14,7.3,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"O: Surprisingly authentic belgian quad. Barrel character is not too strong, just adds a bit of caramel sweetness and perhaps a little heat. Does not feel nearly as heavy as it actually is, it drinks well for an 11.5% barrel-aged quad in fact. Warms the belly for sure though, so there's no hiding in the end. Very tasty and easy drinking. Well done Clown Shoes, to another 5 years of even more delicious brews.","Dope","Jan 01, 2015"
