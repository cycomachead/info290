4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 1/23/2017. Pours lightly cloudy pale ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, pepper, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apricot, apple, caramel, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, pepper, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apricot, apple, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, pepper, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/fruity/spicy flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, lightly slick/bready, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome quadruple style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2014"

There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

The hints of fig, and pear were big as was the nice amount of sweetness that was added in to try and pull it all together. nice spicy rum like flavor that was intermingled and laced with lots of dark fruits.

4.41,10.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 mL brown Belgian bottle, cork-n-cage, best by 12/22/14 (bottled 12/22/09 perhaps?). Brewed and bottled in Royersford, PA; 9.9%. Pours a highly-carbonated deep crimson/plum, with good clarity and a huge, pillowy three finger head that leaves lots of nice, frothy lace. That's a pretty easy five for appearance. Smells sweet, with mature malt, fruity hops and yeast, plums/prunes, raisins, figs, and dates. Sweet, warming, and candy-like on the palate, with lots of dark fruits from dark sugars or malts (or both). There are notes of candied figs, dates, sweet raisins, a touch of roast, a few phenols, cola?, clove?, pecans?, and some floral/spicy hops which impart a moderate bitterness. The body is lightish, crisp and dry, with lots of carbonation and a bitter/roasty/fruity linger. This is an absolutely wonderful beer that is quite well-brewed and dangerously drinkable. My only quibble is that it is a touch sweet, but even with that, the beer remains well-balanced. Without question one of the best quadrupels brewed on this side of the Atlantic; highly recommended.","mmmbeer","May 25, 2011"

First pour is dark mahogany with coca cola cherry red highlighst and a really big head. Hard to get a grasp of all the flavor components, but there's alot of rich, sweet mal, and dark fruits -- raisins, prunes, sweet figs, and caramel butterscotch candy. A bit of rum creeps in. The second pour is much cloudier -- as with all 750 Southamptons, thick and chewy, an elegant abbey-style quadruple.

3.77,-5.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a very dark brown, with hints of plum around the edges if held up to light. A decent, but not overly impressive tan head rises and leaves a fair amount of lacing, though head retention is a little bit weak. The nose has the expected dark fruit flavors, but there's also much more of a spicy yeast presence, which is somewhat intriguing. The taste is a little bit of a letdown, as yeasty spiciness from the nose disappears and the remaining malt sweetness tastes a little watered down (though still far from bad). There's a brief flash of alcohol warmth at the very end of each sip. The carbonation level is fine, but as the taste hinted at, the body of the beer is a little thin. Overall it's a pretty drinkable beer though, it's got a good flavor and the alcohol presence serves to add to the taste and avoids being harsh in any way. Southampton Abbot 12 is a good beer, but for my money a well executed quad is one of the best beers on the planet and this just doesn't quite measure up to that lofty standard.","axeman9182","May 23, 2010"

In terms of feel, taste, and aroma, Southampton's quad is not in the same league as Saint Bernardus or Trappistes Rochefort, but it's a good beer.

Big aromas of malt and sugary fruit. Flavor was much of the same with very rich alcohol soaked fruit, raisins and figs being the dominate notes.

Raisins and dates are very prominent, followed by caramels, booze and a syrupy sweetness that verged on overpowering. Booze and sweetness become more and more of defining characteristic with warming.

High ceilings beware as we uncaged this bottle the cork literally shot at least 15 feet into the air, I'm glad we missed the lights. That would have been an expensive quad. Appears a dark deep semi clouded mahogany with large fine bubbled head formed thick, it dwindles slowly and settles with a chunky texture with fine Belgian lacing gracing the sides of our chalices. Aromatics contain tart pungent fruit notes of vinous origin with raisin, plum, and sweet tart berry jam notes flowing with ease. All complemented by a touch of brash anise and decadent vanilla icing notes as well. Flavor is dessert sweet in the forefront of the palate with a flowing barrage honey and Belgian candi sugar. Balanced by tart trickling plum and a mild glaze of alcohol just searing the palate. Complex with multiple dimensions not sticky sweet with spice additions of clove and peppery notes coming out from the yeast utilized here. Mouthfeel is succulent with effervescent slightly prickly carbonation as it settles after the big pour a creamy effect takes over as it warms up a bit leaving just a touch of residual sugars bringing out some stickiness. Drinkability drink some more now but has so much promise to become amazing with some sleep in the cellar. A great complex quadrupel worthy of the hype and accolades Southampton is known for.

Not sure, but I imagine that vanilla characteristic is part of the 10.5% ABV; nicely done. Those bountiful tiny bubbles really lend a creaminess to the mouth feel. Full flavored and bubbly, the sweet dark fig fruit taste is complemented by a tangy almond kick. This one is coming across like one my favorite Belgian Strong Dark Ales instead of a Quad.

Fairly rich and big bodied, the alcohol strength and slightly peppery effervescence help to balance the body.

Taste was, like Eric (Turdfurgison) says, a lot like St. Bernardus...quite spicy and full bodied, lots of tasty maltiness, and caramel flavors. cloves, citrus, and tangy alcohol. finish is of capers and ethanol. full bodied and tasty beer. definitely a winner in my book.","aforbes10","Apr 27, 2007"

4.37,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"2006 vintage, 750ml bottle received in trade with cooperrip, but I saved it for a special occasion. Im drinking this to celebrate my two hundred and fiftieth-beer karma point. Chilled below room and poured rather passively into Watou goblet. Head rose to nice one finger thickness and now stands steady about a centimeter above the surface. The head is a creamy off white and the body is a dark/black cola color lightening up toward the bottom, which is a subtle rusty amber color, looks sort of like a plum as a whole. Smells of vanilla and hay (especially when its cold), wonderful dark fruit esters, raisins, rummed plums, dates, maybe some rock candy, slight sherry notes, the tiniest hints of anise, with no real hop presence. As with most quads this beer has to be allowed to warm up to grasp its full aromatic potential. Taste is slightly sweet with strong esters and malt character. I get strong date character seconded by raisins, hints of anise and earth plus a slightly boozy tinge toward the finish and an absolute alcohol warmth. The bitterness is just enough to balance the sweet malt and alcohol flavors. This is not a session beer its the sort of beer you drink slowly and if you drink the 750ml by your self its all you drink. Wonderful beer, great/interesting quad sad I cant get it here in Chicago.","mmcave","Dec 19, 2006"
3.5,-12.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle courtesy of Adrian910ss: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a big off-white foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some hints of dry fruits (figs and plums). Taste consisted of some sweet malt with some very subtle Belgian yeast and some very subtle dry fruits such as figs and plums. Body is slightly above average with no alcohol discernable. I dont know if my expectation were too high or if I got another so-so bottle of Southampton but I wasnt impressed at all and thought this was quite far from the staple of the style (Rochefort, Westy, St-Bernadus).","Phyl21ca","Oct 03, 2006"
4.47,12.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4" light tan head over the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Head is quickly down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with average to good lacing. Aroma is lightly fruity and spiced dark maltiness. Flavor is just what the nose portended, with little to no alcohol taste, but the warming throat and tingly lips tell you that, like those old pasta sauce commercials used to say "It's in there...". Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent as well. Unsurprisingly, another excellent offering for the 750 Series. Wish these were distro-ed just a little bit further out, but I'll trade and/or travel to find them.","ppoitras","Jun 23, 2006"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Shared a large bottle of this stunning brew at the Hop Devil's Belgian room in NYC. Nose is of Rum, raisins and glowing alcohol and malt. Shining and glowing dark brown in color, murky with a dark tan head, warming and tasty, big flavors of more rum, raisins, ripe dark fruits. World class sipper, go get some, but it away for awhile or enjoy right now, fine, fine creation from SHampton.","Billolick","Beers"
4.43,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured an opaque dark purple color with black and crimson hues and a soft tan colored head that dissipated quickly. The surface was covered in small and medium sized bubbles that retained their shape for quite awhile. Aromas of hard candy, roasted malt, toffee, and plums. This beer is filled with flavor; dried fruits, sweet malt, sweet candy, sublte hops, etc. Well balanced, considering the style, with just the right touch of carbonation and texture to make it easy to drink despite the high alcohol content. A mildly bitter finish seals the deal. Easy to sip and enjoy with a variety of foods. In my opinion, this beer is on par with some of the finest Belgian beers.","jaluria","0"
4.65,16.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Tastes fruity and quite complex with nice woven caramel and chocolate flavors as well. Big body, which is typical of Belgian Trappist ales. Well hidden alcohol. In my opinion this is right up there with Rochefort, Westveteren, St. Bernardus and is one of the best darker Belgian styles that is brewed in the states.","Crosling","Oct 02, 2004"

4.58,15.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep barown/garnet read color with a 1/4" head that pretty much stays for the whole drink, very nice Belgian lace. The aroma is sweet malt, raisins, yeast, some roastyness. This is a beautiful drinking beer, full of sweet malt, alcohol, yeasty goodness, fruity, warming flavors. I'd imagine that if I went to Belgium, this is what beer tastes like, makes you forget that other abbey beer, you know the one that starts with a Ch.","kennyo","Sep 18, 2004"

4.12,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,3.5,"Deep dark brown, light ruby hints. Small off-white head. Big, deep and juicy aromas of dark fruits (grapes, dates, banana, figs) and chocolatey malt (not as proeminent as rochefort 10). Sweet doughy yeast, cookie-ish in fact gets along well with the toffee or caramel ice cream reminiscent malt. Palate procures a light tartness which is not unpleasant. Very fruity from the beginning to the end, extremely malty leading even to a slight roasty bite. This may not be totally world-class, but it isnt too far, very well-built for sure, complex, but also very sweet and in need of a few years to reach its full potentials imo. This was a 2003 bottle. Mouthfeel is awesome though, creamy, smooth, well rounded big body with carpet soft carbonation. Again, 2 thumbs up for biruchan and schoolteacher!","Rastacouere","May 16, 2004"

4.71,18.3,3.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark amber color. Rich aromas of dark fruit waft from my glass as I pour it. The carbonation is quite low, with only a wispy head, when roused it shows a brown color. Fig dominates the aroma, though it is joined by dark caramel notes, almost a coca-cola type quality, earth, wood, alcohol, brown sugar. Quite a rich aroma, it is super malty almost like a strong bock. The beer itself was some what lighter bodied than I was expecting, still rich though with an almost meaty quality to it. It is fairly sweet with an astringent finish that seems to be a combination of alcohol and yeast character. Tastes like it has just started to oxidize, perhaps, this adds to the rich maltiness of this brew. This beer is redolent of dark concentrated fruit; fig, raisin, prunes, and a hint of orange in the finish. There are some banana and clove notes here as well. As this beer warms up the concentrated fruit notes really picks up. All I can say is that this is deceptively good. Rich, complex, and hearty what more do you need.","Gueuzedude","Feb 02, 2004"
3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"2003 - This is what I like. A deep, dark ruby beer with a fruity/spicy aroma. It is very malty and quite complex. It is warming from the alcohol, though I do not know what the ABV is. It finishes dry and slight tart. I wish I bought a second bottle to see what it was like in a few years.","ark57","Jan 09, 2004"
3,-24.6,4,4,2.5,3,2.5,"I've been assured that the alcohol subsides considerably with time, and it becomes quite a good beer. As for the still carbonation, perhaps I got a bad bottle, or the bottle conditioning didn't take off? I'm certainly going to wind up with another bottle at some point, and I'll re-review appropriately. I'm open to anyone who feels like sending me one!","UnionMade","Jan 08, 2004"
4.82,21.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"It was a dark reddish brown colour, pretty. It smelled great, belgian-y, sweet like brown sugar, very fruity/grapey and spicy. Tasted even better! Yep, you guessed it- it made me smile real big. It tasted sweet and fruity and spicy like it smelled, but with a nice alcoholic feel to it. It was kind of a flavor-burst, that's how I might describe it. Gosh, I could really go for some more right about now... or anytime for that matter. Mouthfeel was good, not quite syrupy, so that added to the drinkability. It felt nice and soft in my mouth and felt a little warming going down to my tummy... but it didnt taste like 12%, so if I had more I would've drank more and probably would've been late for work today. Good one!","erica","Dec 14, 2003"
