4.11,-7.8,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,"OVERALL: Really nice. This is certainly a very sweet beer with a massive OG and only 22 IBU, so it might not be for everyone. The people I shared it with all found it to be too much. I love me some malt bombs though, especially if itâ€™s got a good barrel component to go along with it, and this one certainly delivered in both departments. Lots of good flavor and a big feel to go with it. The head could use a little work, but whatever. Thanks again ScottO. Enjoyed this one.","Jeffo","Mar 16, 2015"

4.53,1.6,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2014 version. Pour is a thick brownish-black. It will be a little surprising for a Quad fan. Head forms only around the sides, but securely. Aroma is a deep bourbon-y vanilla--I inhaled several times before consuming. Feel is purely robust, with barrel sweetness dominating the taste. It's so rich, a slow drink is required, if you happen to consuming all 22 oz. alone. While both being different styles, I find the overall feel and taste to be a mix of BCBS and Backwoods Bastard. Overall, a unique pleasure to drink.","BuccoFan","Feb 05, 2015"

The nose is quite amazing. I got brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, a hint of roastiness, and dark fruits. The taste is vanilla bourbon with a prominent sweetness and subtle hints of fruitiness. The finish is full and smooth as could be. Next to no carbonation leaves a heavy mouthfeel and a thickness to the body. It's a definite sipper but more than worth the experience.","PSU_Mike","Nov 02, 2014"

The well-rounded barrel character distracts the palate away from all the sweetness enough to keep it from going over the edge. They bill this as a 'Central Coast Quad', but if you are expecting anything resembling the Trappist classics such as Rochefort 10 or Chimay Grande Reserve, you will be completely confounded. It comes across more as a huge, sticky barleywine. In the past this beer was used only for blending purposes, and with its ridiculous sweetness it's not hard to see why. However, this is one of the rare instances in which a blending beer can stand on its own two feet, even if it is teetering on the edge of drinkability. Brinksmanship at its finest.","ryan1788a5","Oct 18, 2014"

The aroma contains notes of sweet caramel and toffee malt. A slight kiss of bourbon is present across the back. The taste is reminescent of raison and plum. Caramel and toffee round things out with a yeasty spiciness. This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. A fine sipper and good representation of a barrel aged quad. Id drink it again if the opportunity presented itself.","stakem","Oct 15, 2014"

4.47,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"worth the hype, more of a barleywine than a quad though, although i suspect thats what they are getting at by calling it a central coast quad instead of a belgian one, but it exhibits a whole lot more barleywine to me. nevermind definitions and classifications though, this is insanely good beer. deep but royal red/brown in color, like good root beer in shade, but super thick and viscous, sticky as taffy, and not very carbonated, but it doesnt need to be. the nose on this is all grain, caramelized malt sugars abound, with notes of toffee and butterscotch, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, honey, and bourbon right from the bottle. its intensely boozy, but in a refined and intentional way. i get the malt layering expected in a quad, but the lack of any real belgian yeast character in the flavor puts this squarely in the barleywine world for me. scorching sugars and vanilla bourbon predominate, but it never really ends up all the sweet considering how much sugar is in here mid palate. oak mellows it for sure, and the booze cuts it well i think. layers and layers of grain nuance keep coming, i absolutely love it. i was so sad to have missed the bottles when they came around, so i am thankful to hops and pie for giving me the chance to finally try this one on tap. its worthy of its high praise, very firestone walker too, very barreled and big, just delicious big beer here. a musty try, more interesting than sucaba i think, but thats just me.","StonedTrippin","Jul 21, 2014"

It pours a clear sunset topaz-sienna topped by a finger or so of sandstone foam. The nose comprises caramelized Belgian candi sugar, mild molasses, toasted oak, toasted coconut, light Connecticut tobacco, graham cracker, clove, light allspice, and a hint of candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, the oak, spices, and sweet elements taking full command in a lovely display of cooperation. A small faction of booze enters into the equation, but it is mostly drowned out by the delicious din around it. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly-syrupy feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, well worth my investment (and anyone else's, for that matter).

Conversely I find many BA brews suffer from beer that may not be big and complex enough to withstand the Barrel Aging process, leaving an end product that's overwrought with too much booziness. To me this is one is a perfect marriage. Big flavors that aren't overwhelmed by the bourbon influence, while the normally thick and syrupy Quad body is thinned out nicely, delivering a smooth and approachable quality of drink. The end result is something like a BA blended barleywine, and it's wonderful. Glad I picked up a 2nd bottle for aging... should be fun to re-visit!","TheSixthRing","Jun 16, 2014"

Classic Firestone Walker barrel aged beer. Huge vanilla and toasted coconut notes, underlined with toffee, caramel and burnt sugar. Taste mirrors the smell, smooth as hell and decently viscous. A nice little bourbon heat that sticks with you at the end. If there is one complaint, it's that this doesn't really do much to differentiate from other Firestone Barrel Aged beers. If I was blind folded and told to guess between this and Sucaba, I'd have a hard time telling them apart.

Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a fine half finger light brown head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma dominated by oak and bourbon, with light supporting dark fresh and dried fruit and caramel, really a barrel aged barleywine profile. Flavor is sweet syrup, vanilla, caramel, dark dried fruit, light stone fruit, oak and bourbon. Full, almost syrupy bodied with little carbonation presence on the tongue. A very interesting flavor in the finish, almost like a fine fruit reduction, flavorful but indescribable. This has quad sweetness, but the heavier fruit of a barleywine, but without the heavy malt flavors. A unique and tasty definition breaking strong ale. Quite sweet and little hop presence. A perfect desert ale. World class. Lucky enough to have an extra for the basement and look forward to this with a few years on it.","LiquidAmber","Jun 05, 2014"

Dark fruits behind the booze, some big oaky notes, and lots of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and toffee. Not much Belgian Quad going on here but I suspect they weren't going for that anyway.

4.14,-7.2,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Verdict: A very tasty beer from Firestone Walker. They call it a quad on the bottle, in the past I've seen it as a barleywine and that's a bit of how I think of it, hard to find much in the way of the yeasty goodness that makes up a strong quad, but this has all the hallmarks of a great barleywine. The alcohol is hidden perfectly and is the beer's best asset. The richness and sweetness is cut nicely by the barrel aging and the complexity is right in the sweet spot where it's definitely layered but still straightforward enough to be accessible to everyone.","kevanb","May 23, 2014"

Gets different as the beer warms but the flavor profile doesn't change too much. I will sit on a couple bottles. Definitely up there on par with Parabola. Got a few at $15.99 which is very reasonable and would probably spend up to $20 on the bottle if I get antsy with my other bottles and have to get desperate. Well done Firestone.","putonyourwalkingshoes","May 23, 2014"

Flavor is more of the same, very delicious, boozy, sweet, great barrel characteristics. It really tastes more like a barleywine than a quad to me, it doesn't seem to have any Belgian characteristics at all. This is quite the fine beer and I stupidly passed on a bottle which means now that I'd like one I won't find one. Oh well, lucky to have had a taste at all. This compares really nicely to Parabola and Abacus, buy it if you see it.","ArrogantB","May 18, 2014"
