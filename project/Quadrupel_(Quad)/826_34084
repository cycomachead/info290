4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 4/2015. Pours fairly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, dark candi sugar, clove, pepper, light caramel, toast, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, light caramel, toast, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, light caramel, toast, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding quadrupel style! All around fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 22, 2014"

Perhaps my palate is just too sensitive and is over-reacting to too much of a good thing. At any rate, this is certainly one of the best quads I have had yet.

The flavor is quite fruity as well with orange and citrus mixed with some sweet cherries raisins and plums. A solid caramel and melanoidin malt sweetness provides a nice balance against the fruit. There's a warming alcohol, but its very faint and never harsh. Medium to thick body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel.

Given the ABV and the quadness, I figured that even if it really had been sitting eternally on a shelf it wouldn't be rotten and old. As it turns out, this really wasn't too bad but it leans toward being gritty-sweet, similar to the frosting on a supermarket sheet cake. Dark-brown to near-black; decent head, if a bit thin; sugary aroma mixed with a Dr. Peppery pruniness; a taste of peaches and figs and then the slightly out-of-bounds sugar. Definitely mellows out upon warming, and makes a nice winter accompaniment to beef stew, popcorn and a decent Hollywood Western. I took about 90 minutes to drink half the bottle; by the bottom of the glass my opinion had definitely risen (although that may just have been the 10.5% talking).","gfreed","Dec 08, 2011"

This beer taste great - vinous, dark fruits interspersed with a subtle spicy character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a crisp carbonation that leaves a residual bite at the back of the throat.

Some nice fruit flavor on the first sip but this is drowned out quickly by the hot nature of the booze. Really could use some time to sit down as it is just too fresh I feel.

If its 2009 that's in the future so its not bottled date and its too soon to be "drink before" for a bottle conditioned ale north of 10%. Oh well. Some things are not for the knowing. Pours absolutely perfectly black with a dense, creamy head that leaves lacing that makes me want to lick the glass clean. Smell is brown sugar, raisins, cherries, vanilla, sawdust, and lemons. :) Taste is oak, cinnamon, raisins, and cloves. Much drier than I expected, with an almost puckering finish. Very nice indeed. Mouthfeel supports the appearance, creamy with a nice tingle of carbonation to offset it. Drinkability is excellent, the bone-dry finish not withstanding. Still won't be an issue at all to polish off the whole bottle. Definitely worth the trouble to acquire.","roblowther","Mar 15, 2008"
4.28,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Aged bottle, not sure how old but says 03/10 on the cork. Guessing about 4 1/2 years old. Pretty much the same as I remember it being fresh, but super smooth, hardly any alcohol or solvent. Quite sweet, quite delicious, everything is quite integrated into one cohesive whole. Sort of like Christmas pudding. Very nice beer, it aged gracefully.","Beerzebub","Mar 01, 2008"
4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Randomly picked from the shelf with no expectations, had never even heard of it. I was immediately impressed. Pours dark as can be, not quite black but a tremendously dark brown, thick off-white head with decent retention and ok lacing. Smell is of a typical Belgian, some bread and yeast, a touch of sweet fruit and a bit of alcohol, a little heavy on the bread smell. Taste is great. It has a very sweet taste to it, very sweet sugar, almost Duvel-ish. Plenty of fruit flavors, a little grassy taste and a warming alcohol taste as it goes down. Medium bodied with low carbonation, a very smooth drinker. the 10.5 ABV is impressive, but whats more impressive is how well its hidden. This is a truely great beer and one I will definitely revisit in the future.","bunnyhustle","Feb 29, 2008"

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Medium/heavy body. Its not really that viscous but once it hits the tongue it really coats everything nicely. Very drinkable, if it were cheaper I would buy a ton of this stuff.","t0rin0","Beers"
4.72,13.7,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Wonderful Beer poured from from caged and corked 750ml bottle. Smells of raisins and fermented apples. Deep Brown color, thin foamy head with nice lacing, head diminishes over time. First sip of the dark caramel-goodness is raisin/plum with citrius and vanillla notes. Slight alcohol taste upfront, alcohol becomes more noticeable as if warms. Nice finish, apples, caramel and yeast become more prevalent as beer warms. Complex but not cloying as some other quads. Fantastic beer highly recommend if you can find. Took my bro and I 2yrs to find our second bottle!","Kraken","0"
4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Good smooth, slightly fluffy full body that is a pleasure to consume. A very good, solid Quad, that I fully recommend. Chalk another one up for Belgium.","scottoale","Feb 09, 2008"

4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: It was full bodied and had a high ABV that might limit its functionality as a session brew. It is a sipper and a wonderful treat to share with friends. I intend to add it to my stash for special occasions.","dnichols","Sep 07, 2007"

3.37,-18.8,4,2,4,3.5,3.5,"The flavours hung around in the mouth and although it is a strong beer, the thickness wasn't rich or pudding like. Can't put my finger on it, but something was missing.

3.79,-8.7,5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Burgundy color, with a full and creamy foam that lasts. Lightly aromatic, with hints of burnt popcorn, brandy, dark fruit (plum) and the attributes of Belgian Yeast.

3.43,-17.3,4.5,4,3,4,3,"Pours very dark, with very little head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is lots of malt, dark fruits, and a little bit of spice. The alcohol is barely present in the aroma and does not even come to the front in the taste. Mouthfeel and carbonation are very nice but this beer is way too sweet for me. I love quads but I think I would turn this down next time. Give me a Rochfort or Pennepot Fisherman's ale instead.","graywalker","Mar 12, 2007"

3.93,-5.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours very, very dark -- nearly black, with only shy tawny highlights that show up with the liquid at a very low level. Strong Brussels lacing, little head. One of the darkest Belgians I've ever seen. Aromas are predominantly sweet, with roasted coffee, cola, dark candi sugar, and some bubble gum leading the way. Very rich, sumptuous aroma. On the palate, cola tastes lead the way, from syrupy sweetness right down to that tarty cola tang. Nutty at the mid-palate, then creamy, before drying out at the finish. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation and thick malts. Overall, this is a big, sweet, smooth quadrupel. I wasn't crazy about the cola flavors, but it's in line with style and well executed. Very good.","geexploitation","Feb 22, 2007"
4.13,-0.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"A pretty decent Belgian Quad here. Val-Dieu's Grand Cru is by far one of the better, top notch brews to be produced by them and worth giving a try. The unique effect of body from start to never ending finish in flavor and tone is the best part(heart) of the whole beer and the main reason to seek it out.","tavernjef","Feb 19, 2007"
4.02,-3.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Taste: mmmm-MMM!!!Espresso whispers, cola hushes, dark fruits and anise, black pepper peeps in, black and chocolate malt, and delicious Belgian malt and yeast. Mmm, darkness and spice aplenty! Yu-um! That's what makes this special, this particular sparkling spiciness....a bit rough in the texture, burrs against the buds to much, methinks...but then this unique and wondrous flavor creeps in ...too much...","BretSikkink","Feb 11, 2007"

A brown color with a medium head that lingered well. Sweet, fruity aroma. A nice vanilla taste, with the dark fruit and Belgian yeast present also. Lovely beer, very smooth.
