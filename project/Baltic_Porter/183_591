I could definitely taste a perfumey, fruity sweetness with every sip.  It's almost like licorice.  It was a taste I've never had before, but after a while, it started to get to me.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, and some cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but the mouthfeel needs improvement in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 02, 2012"

The beer has a medium light body, creamy carbonation, & long finish. There is a definite sweetness to this beer, however the beer dries the palate on the finish (not bitter, just dry). Overall, I really liked this beer & would love to drink it again, but, unfortunately, this beer is way over valued at $10 a bottle.

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,4,2,3.5,"OVERALL: This is definitely Belgian in style, more like a Belgian double or strong dark ale than a Baltic porter. Given how Belgian porters and stouts come out, this is to be expected. It's enjoyable, drinkable, and tastes very nice, even if it isn't really a porter as most of us known them. In fact, the thin feel was the only thing that really hurt the beer. In the end, if you're in the mood for a good, interesting, and unique Belgian, like a strong dark or a dubbel, then give this a try. On the other hand, if you're looking for an English or American style porter, try elsewhere.","Jeffo","Jan 14, 2009"

3.05,-17.6,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Taste is very fruity with mango and other exotic fruits. A bit of a metallic taste, probably from the dark malts.

I don't know if the bottle was just very shaken up or what, but it poured with two-three fingers of thick mountainous head, almost like an ice cream soda. Rosewood color. Looks great, and the head remained all the way to the bottom of the glass (if there'd been some lacing, this would have been a perfect score). Smells richly of malts and yeast, prunes and (didn't think of this at the time, but agree with the reviewer who wrote) butter. As everyone else said -- not like any other porter you've ever had -- more like an abbey brun. Tasted good, rich and sweet, and sips of the thick head provided a bitter yeasty counterpart to the malts. A big body that goes down smooth -- if I could find this beer at a more reasonable price, I'd buy it now and again (would be a nice winter warm-up), but as is, I think it's more of a one-timer. Very cool bottle -- is it made of stone?","jbsteiny","Mar 29, 2007"
4.13,11.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is barely a porter, and probably only classified as such because it says PORTER on the label. There is not one characteristic in this beer that says its a porter. However, this one is a new category. An English Porter has a strong malt presence, an American Porter has a strong hop presence, and now a Belgian Porter has a strong yeast presence. The amount of diacetyl (a yeast byproduct) is very prevalent. There is also a fruity characteristic that is similar to the one found in Belgian Ales. If you're looking for something traditional, you may want to try something else. But if you're looking for something new, this is right up your alley.","BeerSox","Mar 13, 2007"

3.38,-8.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Fruit juice, strawberry, cocoa, pizza dough, earthy taste. Some hops but they're mainly in the aftertaste and don't contribute much to the aroma or taste.","mschofield","Mar 28, 2005"
3.67,-0.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Notes: Not very porter-ish for a Baltic porter. It's lacking the roastyness. Also the body is very thin. There are some flaws, but good flavor nonetheless.","dauss","Jan 23, 2005"
3.82,3.2,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Head is noisy, fizzy, and light tan. Second pour head is fluffy, still and dense. The beer is a rich, clear, dark walnut with ruby highlights. There are a few swoops of lacing. Gorgeous nose: sweet, bready toffee. Sweet toffee and chocolate up front. A thick, buttery, malt middle. A strange, buttery, non-sweet fruit in the finish. Really, not sweet at all, but fruity. Also: alcohol and spice. This beer starts great, but finishes a little disappointing. Still, good, interesting.","kbub6f","Dec 03, 2004"

3.68,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"750 ml bottle, ceramic with a bail top. No real complexity to note and this beer should probably not be in the Baltic Porter style, more of a regular Porter. Easy to consume.","GCBrewingCo","Sep 06, 2004"
4.13,11.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a two-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep red/amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is malty. Starts with a roasted hazelnut sweetness and finishes smooth with no bitter aftertaste or hints of alcohol. A very good porter, quite different from typical American porters - Stone, Heavyweight, Redhook etc. 750ml bottle for $10.99 at Hoosick St Discount Bev. Troy, NY.","jdhilt","Sep 05, 2004"
3.73,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a copper brown color with crimson highlights. Solid dark white head that soon faded to just covering the top of the beer. Tons of lacing. This doesn't look like a porter but it still looks nice. The smell is strongly yeasty and slightly bready, probably a little too yeasty of an aroma for me. The taste begins really sweet with caramel malts, its almost cloying but the yeast comes and stops that. There's a tart flavor from the yeast that holds throughout. More sweetness comes in with a fig newton like taste. The finish is yeasty and figgy and it holds in my mouth for a long time. Not a porter in the classic sense but I still liked it.","granger10","Jul 06, 2004"
2.65,-28.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"There is no way I am dignifying this lack luster beer a porter. It does not share any of the qualities that a porter should have. Much like Saku Porter, it does not have the porter look to it. Clear red with little head that is gone in a blink. The taste is citrucy with mild malts. This is a big let down. Don't even get me started on it.","CBFanWish","May 30, 2004"
3.63,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear amber hue under a 2.5 finger tan head that has marvelous body, great staying power and superb lacing. It is too pale for a porter, however. The mild nose features caramel. The mouth is pretty well carbonated and too light for a good porter. The taste is watery, but there are caramel flavors here, with a slight hoppiness in the finish. The sweet caramel dominates the aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer, but it has little in common with what I expect from a porter. If they renamed this a brown ale, that'd get much higher marks.","Globetrotter","Apr 17, 2004"
3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is decent. It has a malty/roasted barley scent that is very pleasant. It has a sweet aroma. The taste is good. It is a light tasting dark beer with malt character and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine porter style Belgian ale. I think I'll have another.","WesWes","Mar 16, 2004"
3.51,-5.1,2.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The malt has a wheat and edgy rye-like taste. Flavors of clove, coriander, orange zest and a lemony bitterness gain in stature as the brew warms. It also improves in drinkability. This is more a Nut Brown than a Poorter.","BeerResearcher","Feb 29, 2004"
3.18,-14.1,4,3.5,3,3,3,"A dark brown pour with ameadium tan....although, this place (Pelgrom) is so friggin dark inside, i can't even see my beer!!! A sweet chocolatley nose with light hints of dark fruit. The body is also of dark fruit such as plum and raisin but the taste fades rather quickly leaving me wanting more. It looked nice and smelled ok but the taste left much to be desired. A very average beer.","Popsinc","Nov 06, 2003"
2.5,-32.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability  This is almost like an Aprils Fools joke. The bottle is stone brown with an authentic Belgium label listing the brewerys origin as 1210, but its contents is macro-flavored, Belgium Strong Dark Ale . . . by Budweiser! It has a cap attached to the bottle . . . as if its going to fill you up with one glass and youll want to save the rest for later.

4.1,10.8,4,4,4,5,4,"Not your typical Porter as I have experienced them to be. This Porter was much to my liking as I like a very smooth beer that goes down easy with no bitterness or sharp aftertaste. This beer poured a small tan head with a cloudy body and a brown hue. There was good lacing with this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth.","hotstuff","Jul 20, 2003"
4.02,8.6,3,3.5,4,5,4.5,"This brew poured a small head of light brown fine to medium bubbles which left a nice lacing as it receded. It has a cloudy brown body with fine particulate. It has a smooth malty flavor but is a little weak for a porter. Very smooth though and I found myself liking the flavor and the taste, just hard to call it a porter.","TheDM","Jul 11, 2003"

3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The pour a cloudless sanguineous color, the head slight, and the lace patchy. The nose is mostly malt, fresh and clean smelling with the start thickly malt, lightly sweet and the top middling in its mouth feel. Finish is penetratingly acidic, the hops toothsome, also a bit vinous and lightly tart with the aftertaste exquisitely dry and long lasting. Different front the run of the mill porters, and the 6.5% ABV adds a bit of warmth to the tummy, well worth a sample, as a change of pace from the American Style Porters.","Gusler","Jan 26, 2003"
3.97,7.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"An interesting beer, may well be in a Porter style as indicated by the bottle (crock).  Clear darker ruby color, small head but pretty dense and creamy.  Doesn't last a real long time.  Yeasty and sharp citrus aromas.  Nice mouthfeel, malt dominates flavor and is in the brown-sugar and caramel range.  A little hoppy squeeze, slightly tangeriney, and helped by moderate carbonation.  Not hugely complex, could use a little more body but a unique brew from Belgium.  The thick, light brown, swing-top crock rocks!","ADR","Jul 15, 2002"
