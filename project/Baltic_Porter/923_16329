Well today, I finally turned in the rough draft for my Master's degree paper and decided that today was such an occasion. Although a big porter as promised, Nefarious let me down in a couple of ways: first the presentation was merely slightly better than your average porter. Not a great starting point when this sucker cost around $7.00 for the bomber. The flavor profile is bold and filled with roasted chocolate malt and dark fruit as expected, however alcohol makes an unwanted appearance as the beer warms beyond 55 degrees or so and at times is borderline caustic as I finished my first pint glass. No qualms with the lighter than expected, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I wouldn't buy another bomber of this simply because there are better imperial stouts and baltic porters to be had for the money. I would consider a pint of it if I found it on tap though....","Bockrules","Sep 30, 2013"

3.64,-5,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"pours dark and smooth, with one of the most absurd heads ive ever seen on a beer. looks like the froth on a good cappucino! 3 inches thick, mocha colored, and lasting the whole time. wow. full marks for appearance! nose is alcohol big time, smells like a belgian sour, tobacco notes in there as well. the flavor is less intense than the nose and quite delicious. hits of dried sour cherries and cigar smoke interchange, with a wine like alcohol dryness. mouthfeel is the perfect porter. drinkable but full bodied, nice carbonation but not in your face. my critique here is largely undefined. when looking at these categories, it scores perfectly well in all of them, but it just isnt my favorit imperial porter. there is something different about this one, really struggling to explain it. it might be that sourness is not what i am used to in this style. alcohol warmth is nice though, and it goes great with a big bowl of cheesy chilli con carne over egg noodles!","StonedTrippin","Nov 09, 2011"

Initially tastes very nice- just as you'd want a Baltic Porter to taste with fruit and a bit of roasty depth. Unfortunately the taste quickly falls off and becomes too light and loses any depth of flavor. In the mouth you get a sense of overcarbonation as well, which contributes a slightly wateriness to the beer. Could be better.","Georgiabeer","Sep 03, 2011"

It is, however, hard to score a good beer that completely trashes the style. This was an imperial porter in name only, and can be more accurately described as a Belgian strong dark ale with some porter influences. Hence the average score in smell and taste. One I would drink again, but would definitely avoid if I was looking for a porter. Thanks again boatshoes. This was an interesting and fun brew to drink.","Jeffo","Jul 03, 2011"

Smells of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, and slight coffee. Taste is of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, coffee, and cocoa powder. This beer has low carbonation with a slightly flat and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good baltic porter that is a bit of a letdown in the mouthfeel. I am glad I picked one of these up though.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 02, 2011"

It's exceptionally sweet, almost closer to an English barleywine but a few shades darker. The sweetness comprises more in the molasses than anything else, and I didn't get much cocoa or bittersweet chocolate as other reviewers did. In the mouth the molasses didn't hold as much as I thought it might, probably a good thing, and there is some roasted grain on the way to slightly balance the molasses that is always present. The mouthfeel is a bit less sticky than I anticipated. Actually I was shocked at how medium this is in body based on what came out in the nose. The finish is long with some roast bitterness balancing the lingering molasses and caramel. Overall I like this beer a good deal, though I was surprised at how tame the sweetness was in the mouth considering how pleasantly overpowering it was in the nose.","EricCioe","Apr 04, 2011"

The taste holds notes of roasted malts, dark chocolate, light spruce, caramel, and light oak. The body is a straight medium with a light moderate carbonation.

Second, I was pretty happy when I had this, my girlfriend had just finished making a fantastic steak dinner for us and it went perfectly with the steak. That said, although I have had the Ten Pin before and enjoyed it, this was the first time I had a chance to really pay attention to it and I was rewarded greatly for that.

3.67,-4.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very dark brown, maybe with some dark ruby highlights. It looks nearly black, in the glass, with a thin head, maybe 1 cm, that falls down kind of quicly to just a little ring, where it leaves inly the tiniest bit of lacing. The smell is filled predominantly with 2 things, dark chocolate and coffe - with the chocolate winning out. Deep in there, there's a bit of earthiness, maybe some burnt bready and leafy smells, and a bit of caramel. Smells interesting, but isn't exactly powerful enough to get me too exited - I think it's because of the size of the head. The tastes comes out like some weak coffee, with a bit of thick and bitter chocolate syrup poured in. The burnt, roasted bitterness almost becomes too, much, but definitely is a good flavor for an imperial porter. There is enough sweetness, but not too much, and not much in terms of fermentation off-flavors. I becomes cola-like at times, nice toasted bread. I'd say that this is good. The body is nice, about medium full, maybe a little better, just a little rush of carbonation, no real bite to it, but there's just a little bit of one. The bitter roasted malt flavor slows me down a bit. The alcohol doesn't seem to powerful, but you can definitely feel it. I'd say that this is a little better than average.","taylorhamrick","Sep 10, 2009"

The aroma was of rich chocolate, toffee, alcohol, roasted malt and hints of nuts. The flavors were of roasted malt, blackened malt, bittersweet chocolate, hints of tobacco. It tasted drier than the aroma suggested and as it warmed up the alcohol became more present in both the aroma and flavor.

There are hop flavors present, seemingly a bit citrusy upfront (although that could be coming from fruity yeastiness), and then more herbal and grassy in the finish. It's well-balanced by a bitterness that stands back at the start, and then jumps in sharply towards the swallow, cutting through the malt and bringing it to a brash, dry finish. Grassy hops and some dark malt acidity linger, compelling you to take another sip or linger with a bit of chalkiness. It's remarkably drinkable in that way.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours out black with a tall dark tan head and leaves some light webbing of lace around the glass. Aroma is full of bitter sweet chocolate and roasted malts. The flavor starts sweet with some caramel before the lightly bitter dark chocolate. Plenty of roasty malts in here with a light underlying smokiness. Pretty nice overall flavor that was a bit milder than I would have liked. Smooth feel with just enough girth to the body. Easy enough drinking that I would have another after the first. Solid example of a big porter.","meathookjones","Aug 02, 2006"

I'm not sure how much of a classic Baltic Porter it is, but it's a delicious, drinkable version that 'snow plows' its way to a strike! with each mouthful. Recommended if you can find it.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 08, 2006"
4.12,7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades pretty quick down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with plenty of lacing. Aroma is smoky yet sweet dark malts. Taste is sweet chocolate, a twinge of smoke, and not much in the way of EtOH. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good. Could be a bit smoother, which would make it go down easier, ubt a nice brew overall.","ppoitras","Jun 23, 2006"

The taste is great. Smooth and not over powered by alcohol. The coffee wrap up stays on the end of your tongue after the dark porter finish. Im not a big fan of the six packs from Ska but there bombers are a must try. If your any kind of fan of the style, give this a try.","RoBotGod","Feb 24, 2006"
3.61,-5.7,2.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear dark brown color with absolutely no head whatsoever. The smell is very nice and complex. Coffee, roasted grain, and a brown sugary sweetness make themselves known. I smell no alcohol. The taste is a bit of a letdown. The roasted flavors don't really come through much and the coffee is very muted along with some cocoa. That leaves a too sweet brown sugar/molasses taste that dominates. There is some pleasant hop bitterness which interacts with roasted malt bitterness in the finish though. This is not robust enough for my tastes. I also feel that the mouthfeel was quite thin. Drinkability was good. There's certainly nothing offensive about it.","PatYoda","Feb 09, 2006"

4.26,11.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beers gets much better as it warms. Molasses, raisins (?...or perhaps some other dark fruit) and a touch of vanilla. I can't decide if there is a cherry sour or not (this would indicate use of Black Patent), but because a bitter jumps in after the initial sweetness. The hops are more apparent and now have some webby qualities I'd attribute to Fuggles and some citrus I'd attribute to a c-hop (sometimes Goldings does this for me, too). The chocolate has taken on an even more refined wet sweet quality. Really nice. The hops and roast has risen enough to contrast with the chocolate nicely and I'm left with a dry hoppy roast finish on my tongue. An alcohol burn pierces sharly forward late in the swallow, but isn't so strong to detract, and it fades nicely. Wow, all the experiences in this beer are well-balanced and play off each other in interesting ways.","mentor","Jun 03, 2005"

Nose is toasted grain dominated with hints of black cherries and caramel, fresh and delightful to the olfactory senses, start is sweet and heavy with malt, top is middling to full in its feel to the palate. Finish is demonstrative in its acidity and the hops delectable in their spiciness with the aftertaste desert dry, the 8 percent ABV leaves a nice warming sensation it the tummy, this beer much better than their Ten Pin.","Gusler","Mar 31, 2005"
