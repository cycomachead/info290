4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, apple, raisin, coffee, toast, molasses, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness. Taste of dark chocolate, coffee, light char, roasted malt, raisin, apple, toast, molasses, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, light char, light fruits, molasses, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted malt flavors with fruity esters; with minimal cloying sweetness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Baltic porter. Very nice balance and complexity of robust roasted flavors with fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 08, 2013"

Poured massively dark brown with a very light tan half finger head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and subtle milk chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one was fairly well balanced and had quite a bit going on throughout it. However, it didn't really standout from some of the more exceptional brews I've had from the style unfortunately. It was quite easy to drink and could definitely get you in a lot of trouble if you aren't careful. Definitely worth your time trying this one if you have not done so before.","thagr81us","Jan 22, 2013"

Dark chocolate and molasses dominate through the mid-palate and finishes dry with some alcohol warmth, roasted malt, and mild espresso-tinged bitterness. Medium bodied and fairly slick and smooth. I have always enjoyed this potent brew and was very happy to see Three Floyds finally bottle it.

4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Very nice porter, dark appearance with some cascade as it formed the head, little to no lacing. Nose was nice with a coffee and roasted malt scent. Taste followed nicely to make a very balanced, enjoyable porter, ABV was very well hidden. Drank much easier than a 9% abv beer should. I would drink this one again in a heartbeat.","Franz4","May 02, 2011"
4.08,1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours as a black colored brew with a nice decent sized head. It's got some tan lacing down the glass. Chocolaty aroma and heavily roasted malts on the nose, not much hops coming off this. Chocolate burnt toast and smoke flavors on the tongue on every sip. Creamy and dry mouthfeel. This brew all around it rather good. Very glad I tried it!","Knapp85","Apr 19, 2011"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"It's hard to believe that it's been over a year since I last had this brew at the 2010 DLD. How time flies... Anyway, it pours a solid obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate, burnt toffee, and cocoa powder. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, yogurt (straight plain, y'all), flowers, pine, light mint, and balsa. Somehow, all of these components combine to form a nice, hoppy-ish Baltic porter. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, a very nice Baltic porter, one that shows that you can add some hops to the style without completely ruining it.","TMoney2591","Mar 30, 2011"

3.6,-10.9,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"I sampled this at Goose Island's Stout Fest and then again later that evening at Three Floyds brewpub. This beer poured a black with a light khaki head. It allowed a little light to pass through so wasn't as dark or thick in body as it could've been. The aromas were sweet, malty, and rich. There was some light chocolate to it with perhaps some dark fruit. The flavors weren't as prevalent as I would have liked. There was light smokiness along with chocolate and light dark fruit sweetness. It was just ok for the style. I found it to be a little thin for a Baltic Porter. This beer was ok but wasn't anything to search out in my opinion.","aasher","Mar 12, 2011"

3.45,-14.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Topless wytch had the headache dark malts (see my beerthoughts). Arrives dark brown almost black with an inch of foamy tan head that lingers. Aroma is all roasted malts. Taste is dry and sharp: bitter and edged. Served off the hand pump, it is creamy and coffee rich with chocolate far in the background. Roasty and rich toasted caramel malts and toasted barley. Not my thing but a spot-on porter enhanced by cask-to-hand-pump engine creaminess.","salvo","Oct 03, 2010"
4.37,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours near black with a bit of a head. The nose brings forward a bit of roast as well as loads of dark fruit in addition to some chocolate and coffee. The taste really brings forward some dark cherries, dates, and plums with good roasted coffee. Fairly full mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a really nice beer that I was glad to be able to try.","Thorpe429","Sep 28, 2010"

4.23,4.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to Steamhead and JoePat for delivery of a sixtel of this delightful brew for sharing at the recent Bowling Green BA gathering. Creamy mocha head and midnight liquid. Everything a Baltic porter should be - assertive but not overbearing with a big body and dense flavor profile of deeply roasted, nearly charred malt flavors and dark dried fruit notes in the background. Finish is a lingering bitterness and a hint of coffee. Very nicely done.","Brent","Aug 01, 2010"

As I poured it, i got chocolate, sense of baking dough not quite cooked. The smell was a little flat for me as in, there were not of alot of things sticking up at me. Now for the taste. Woodsey, hoppy and a spice or 2.As for the mouthfeel, this was one that was thin but chewy as well. I swished it around for awhile and it left a nice coat of tatse in my mouth after I finished.

4.08,1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark amber with about a half inch of head. I'd really appreciate more head, but with a growler fill carbonation goes down hill in a hurry. The smell is nothing special. SOme roasted malt and that's about it. The taste is unique IMO. Malty with a lot of hop flavor without excessive bittering. It tastes a little too hoppy for a baltic porter but the mouthfeel is great. It reminds me of a hoppy choclate shake. I'm not doing justice to the flavor, but it really is a great drinker.","degerbah","Feb 16, 2010"

4.13,2.2,4,3.5,5,3.5,3.5,"I've been waiting for this beer to come out again since late last summer. This was quite a delight. Pours an opaque black with no highlights. Very roasty smell. Taste is roasted malt with toffee, caramel and coffee (slight hints). Sweet and sticky mouthfeel. Barely resembles a traditional porter, but this is something I always look forward to. Now maybe they'll bring back the Sand Pebbles from last summer too!","thedrewski86","Oct 11, 2008"

4.52,11.9,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Sampled at the brew pub in a 1/2 pint glass. This beer appeared a dark brown. A scant khaki head that left hardly any lacing. Smell is fruity sugar with a giant coffee back. Taste is a chocolaty coffee punch, backed with a fair share of hoppy vanilla twang. Simply, it is VERY tasty. Mouthfeel was a nice blend of creaminess and some drying hop oils. Extremely drinkable. I had to stop myself from really going at that 1/2 pint glass. This is one brew that they should really consider bottling, there aren't many offerings of this style around. And this beer is easily amongst the best","crayphish","May 26, 2008"

Taste is similar, nice thick chocolate and coffee roast, tofee, sherry, alcohol, some dark fruits, brown sugar, wood, very rich and roasty, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied, low carbonation, super smooth, very drinkable. Excellent beer!","Viggo","May 15, 2008"

Decent beer, but the Decimator was my beer of choice.","FtownThrowDown","Beers"
