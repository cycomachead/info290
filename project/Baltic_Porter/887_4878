It's boozy and has a bold malt presence, but lacks some of the dark malt character and taste that would make it more distinct for the style.

The malts are the superstar of this beer and they are fantastic. It is medium bodied but the creamy texture almost makes it seem heavier. For such a rich beer it goes down very easily. IN some ways this reminds me of a dunkel. Roasted flavors are non existent as are fruity ale flavors. This may be bottom fermented. I high recommend this, it is sweet and delicious.","Theheroguy","May 24, 2014"

Nose had a caramel/coconut/chocolatiness, very sweet with a touch of alcohol heat lurking underneath. Mouthfeel was medium and caramel was the prevalent flavor on the tongue, followed by banana and chocolate. Talk about truth in advertising! I did not transcribe the label until I was well into my review, but they really got it right. Finish was still quite sweet and left me wondering how much fermentable sugar remained at the end of the brewing process. I'll bet that this could have been made higher in alcohol. No matter.

Not really a knockout, but pretty interesting. The taste is ok. Porter is not a favorite style of mine anyway, and Baltic Porter is not going to be either. Nothing objectionable here though.

The beer poured a slightly hazy brown, with some carbonation. The head, lacing, retention were respectable. The nose is loaded up with caramel malts, burnt brown sugars, and lots of ABV. The taste wasn't particularly creamy, interesting, nutty, roasted, or toasted malt; a bit syrupy, and it is cloyingly sweet, but in a liqueur like way.

The smell is deep malts, somewhere between a dark lager and a baltic porter. Actually closer to the baltic porter category, with evident ethanol. The taste is blatic porter, but I didn't appreciate it as much as Okocim. Still, it had dark fruits (plums, raisins) and sweetness.

As you look from the bottle to what you poured in disbelief that it came from the same bottle, a strange curiosity comes over you to try this concoction. The taste is a little more familiar to a porter and you start to relax a little. Once you can find the bitter tasting hops under the sweet, almost chocolate like malts. You realize that after the first mouthful there isn't much of a trail left in your mouth, for this is a lighter bodied porter. Before you know it the glass is half gone.

A good touch of woody sweetness is on there too. Flavor is extremely tangy sweet at first. Seems a bit too much and overpowering. That goes away and is replaced by a sweet caramel and woody character. It's almost like this is an amber ale disguised as a baltic porter. Feel is okay. Decent carbonation. Odd liquid feel that borders on syrupy and slimy. The verdict is that this one just falls short.

Its deep dark body is quite nice, though it provides little head. Utenos has a sweet taste with caramel and a molasses taste and texture to it, yet oddly enough without a syrupy mouthfeel. Its smooth taste masks the moderately high (6.8 %) alcohol count, and makes it easy to enjoy a couple. I first enjoyed Utenos with barbecued pork chops, and it complemented the meat very well. One of my favorite porters, Utenos goes great with dinner, with dessert, or just relaxing with friends. It's also equally good as a way to beat the heat, or to enjoy on the porch in the dead of winter. Very good porter and well worth trying.","Gehrig","Oct 29, 2007"

Alas the taste falls short of the initial impression. It is weaker in body than the 6.8% alcohol would suggest. Flavors open with a caramel malt and settle into a leathery raisin character. The finish is an unpleasant tangy astringent coffee ground flavor lingering along with, alas body, yes there it is a thick sweetness sitting on the back of my tongue playing with roasted malt and that bad coffee bite.

The body continues to firm up through the drink, but never gets thick. Has a mildly roasty / toasty finish with residual sweetness.

The taste is extremely sweet, with a chocolate, sugary quality. Again, not much hop flavor. The beer is a little metallic. Just a little bitterness in the finish provides a relief from the sweetness.

3.82,9.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy milky brown, not the dark brown I was expecting. Short lived tan head leaves behind sparse lacing. It has nice malty sweet aroma like one would expect for the style. Taste is sweet malt with a very short lived but pleasantly bitter aftertaste. The pricing on this beer is fair and I will have to pick up some more for the larder.","Citadel82","Nov 01, 2004"
3.15,-10,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"A large (375ml) bottle looks inviting. The beer pours a reddish brown walnut color, lighter than one would expect for this style. It had a cereal nose, bread, almost toasty, and the taste is of burnt sugar, alcohol and roasted malts. It does develop a bit over time and temperature, but there's little payoff in the end and the alcohol is apparent and poorly hidden. And although most porters will fool you and are actually a bit less full-bodied than one thinks, this one is just too light for my taste. It's not terrible, but there are too many other great inexpensive beers in this style that are readily available.","horndecker","Oct 08, 2004"
2.93,-16.3,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Orange to copper with reddish tones, decent off-white head lasts a bunch of minutes. Big syrupy smell, concentrated malt, star anise, sweet berry fruitiness. It reminds me of a baby samichlaus. Highly carbonated surprisingly. Alcohol is very obvious, especially for a beer not topping 7%. Leaves a burn on the back of the tongue. Very sweet flavor profile, a bit too much for me ultimately. Big caramel candy alone could be a pleasure for fans of sweet beers, but combined with the intense alcohol, I dont see how anyone could finish a whole bottle.","Rastacouere","Sep 12, 2004"
2.75,-21.4,2.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"This is some wierd stuff. Not sure what to make out of it. It pours a murky cherry-brown with a large beige head. Smell is of vinegar, alcohol, maybe some prunes, bourbon. Definitely strange. This is not like any porter I've yet sampled. Taste is much of the same, bourbon, figs, prunes, alcohol, and a ridiculous sweetness. I was very disappointed in this beer's drinkability. While not as bad as the horrid Black Abbot, its pretty gross as far as sweetness goes. I also had the wierdest dream ever after drinking this, so be warned!","ChrisBowers","Aug 09, 2004"

2.14,-38.9,4,2.5,2,2,1.5,"Although I like the flavor in having one pint, the drinkability is not so great. I can only have one bottle. I don't want a second and I think I might get sick if I have another. Must be the black olives in the aroma that turn me off to drinking any more than one pint.","BrewMaster","Jun 23, 2004"

3.47,-0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is too sweet for a Porter, lacks the deep roastiness and coffee hints. It's not a bad beer but it's a lot closer in flavor profile and body to a Doppelbock than a Porter. That being said, it's a decent Doppelbock but only a so-so Porter.","rkhaze","0"

4.06,16,5,4,4,4,4,"A pleasnat surprise dicovered on my weekly package store visit today. Beaytutiful dark amber copper color with a cloudy pillow like head. Smell was sweet, malty with a raisin aroma. Taste was initially sweet with fruity and aclohol undertones. Mouthfeel was smooth enough for the style and finished in a light bitterness. Very drinkable, especially as it warmed...smooth qualities. Additionally, it reminded me of a brandy...very nice. Worth a try (don't drink ice cold)","edchicma","Apr 30, 2004"
3.61,3.1,3.5,2.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability - this isn't like a regular porter, but I think I'd buy it again. Doppelbock, even a darker than average Maibock seems to be a more accurate classification, though.","brewdlyhooked13","Apr 17, 2004"

3.15,-10,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This is ok for one pint, but the sweetness is a bit much for repeated downing. I was rather disappointed in this, as I had been looking forward to a Baltic porter all day. Aldaris, from nearby Latvia, is head and shoulders above this.","woemad","Feb 14, 2004"
3.72,6.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This is an easy drinking, sweetish, version. Somewhat underwhelming and nowhere near the hallmarks of the style as it's missing a crucial element with the absent roastedness. Nevertheless, it's entirely pleasant.","cokes","Jan 30, 2004"
3.5,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear and reddish tan with a thick orangish brown head. Big doughy malt aroma with notes of caramel, licorice and molasses. Medium bodied, soft and smooth. Flavor is really sweet like a Doppelbock in my opinion. Roasted malt with licorice and noticable alcohol in the finish. Overall an average Baltic Porter.","BierReise","Jan 23, 2004"

3.8,8.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This porter comes in a completely undistinguished-looking 500 ml. bottle: brown bottle with a flat gold label and black lettering. Oh well, Lithuania has never been known as a flash country. The color is surprisingly light for a porter; in fact, the lightest porter I've seen. It looks more like Old Crustacean than Anchor Porter. The head is nothing more than a memory almost immediately, leaving behind what looks like a glass-full of bittersweet chocolate. Although the smell of roasted malt is present, it's on the light side. The most assertive flavor is a fairly strong chocolate. Hops are barely noticeable. All in all, a decent effort, but I'm really looking forward to the Carnegie Stark Porter that's sitting in the fridge.","mickeymac","Nov 26, 2003"
3.19,-8.9,5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Fairly sweet taste up front, with a corresponding medium body. Lightly bitter in the finish with notes of chocolate, a hint of roast malt and a finish of alcohol. This beer is perhaps a bit too sweet for me, this tastes like it might be intentionally sweetened at bottling time. The sweetness seems a bit one dimensional and the body of this beer needs to be thicker to pull it off. Interesting, though only 6.8% the alcohol is quite evident in this beer.","Gueuzedude","Nov 17, 2003"

2.81,-19.7,4,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Dark ruby in color with a pillowy off-white head that diminishes into a fine lace. Not very chocolatey for a porter. I am instead overwhelmed by brown sugar. That sugar sweetness hits my taste buds immediately and lingers long after my sip is finished. A tiny bit of raisen flavor, but overall just a one-dimensional beer.","dmarch","Nov 01, 2003"
3.14,-10.3,4,2.5,3,4,3.5,"This beer had a small sized tan head with fine-medium sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing.The body was normal for a Baltic Porter with carbonation observed and it had a brown hue.The aroma was mildly malty and the flavor consisted of malt and caramel.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, light bodied and somewhat thin.The lacing was fair.","hotstuff","Oct 22, 2003"
3.75,7.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall: Not a bad effort, and nowhere near as bad as Baltika say, but whilst this had plenty of toasted malts, it had very little roasted character and very little bitterness, if any. This was nevertheless certainly well worth the excursion for the experience, but probably not the price of $2.50. Now if this was bottle-conditioned it may well have been a different story.","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 04, 2003"

4.2,20,4,4,4.5,4,4,"As the others mentioned, this baltic porter pours out much lighter in color than what most of us are used to. Kinda like a bock or light dopplebock. Has a rusty, burnt amber to brown color. Nearly opaque. Once you get past the color you notice some other differences as well. The aroma is sweet creamy carmels, and slighty toasted malt. Taste is sweet, malty, and lack the bitterness and roasted flavors, indeed a completely different style of beer. Toasted and sweet carmel candy taste, with a hint of alcohol heat. Faint chocolate tastes, or did I just talk myself into that. Smooth and mellow, not roasted or bitterness. Definitly worth a try and unique. I liked it, just get out of your head porter, or read up baltic porters before trying them.","StevieW","Sep 06, 2003"
3.8,8.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"The flavor is not complex, but it is still satisfying. Roasted maltiness upfront, with fading sweetness and alcohol bite in the finish. The body seems a bit light for the style. Overall a decent representation of the style.","brakspear","Jun 23, 2003"
3.58,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This poued into the glass with an attractive rocky, long-lived cream colored head. Settles to a deep ruby-brown, very lightly carbonated brew. There was liquorice and molasses in the nose, along with a nice amount of malt. The taste started sweet with more molasses and a herbal hop bitterness that fades quickly, followed by a hint of alcoholic warmth. Finishes sweet and long, with a slight drying bitterness at the end.","beerluvr","Jun 04, 2003"
3.97,13.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I only knock the appearance down due to the fact that it doesn't resemble a porter. Lighter in color. However, if this was listed as a doppelbock, I would be quite pleased. Reminds me of a Moretti LaRossa. Sweet, smooth, and creamy. Nice taste. Nice head, good retention. Some lacing. Smells of sweet carmel, some alcohol. Really a cross between a porter and a bock. Whatever the category, this is an enjoyable beer that I will try again.","JohnnyDuvel","Apr 28, 2003"
4.45,27.1,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Stereotypes are wrong, but when I think porter, I think DARK.. This is the second time I've seen a porter that poured like a brown ale...(1st was the belgian 'Poorter' from the Sterkens brewery, but thats another tale...) my guard is up and I'm definitely not expecting the pleasingly balanced roasted flavor that entices my taste buds from the very first sip. The smell is sweet and the taste is a sweet malty start with a slightly bitter hoppy finish. Mild flavors of dark chocolate and toffee are present making this beer and excellent finisher for the evening. While it may be not as 'robust' as some of the other baltic porters, it is definitely worth trying. Kudos to Lithuania on this one!","TripelJ","Dec 29, 2002"
3.55,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer does not look like a porter at all! It's dark amber and semi-transparent. You can see some sediment in it... interesting. Pours a thick, foamy head. Looks great, but the head does not last long. Smells sweet and fruity. Tastes sweet, too. Just a little smoky. Some hints of honey in there, too. Pretty good mouthfeel. Very interesting taste, leaves you with a lot to think about, such as, "what the hell is going on in my mouth right now?"","dwarbi","Jul 09, 2002"
3.3,-5.7,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The color deep ruby red on the pour, the head monstrous in size, frothy in its texture, the lace a nice clinging sheet to seal off the glass. Lightly toasted grains, sweet like caramel candy, quite pleasant to the nose, the start quite sweet and malt laden, top is middling in feel. Finish has a pertinent hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate and the aftertaste dry and long lasting, a decent porter, not great, but quite drinkable nonetheless.","Gusler","Beers"
2.58,-26.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Porter, from Lithuania:  In a thick brown half liter bottle.  “A premium dark beer.”  A very deep ruby color when held up to light, that is surprisingly clear.  The head is a coffee with cream color, and the head dissipated very quickly.  The aroma is clean and not overwhelming. The taste is malt at the beginning, and chocolate/burnt malts toward the end with a very clean finish.  Slight alcohol warmth.  Nothing special.","jackndan","0"
