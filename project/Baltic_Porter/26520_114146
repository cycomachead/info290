The coconut flavor mixes so well with the coffee, chocolate, and bourbon flavors.  They definitely took a risk by the amount of coconut (first the smell) and then the forward tasting flavors.  Could have been a disaster but its well done.  Great work Jack's Abby.","Tbub18","Nov 05, 2014"

This however, is the opposite. Bourbon everywhere. From start to finish. Maybe even a little too much? Seems to overshadow the base beer and the adjuncts quite a bit.","Dope","Jul 30, 2014"

This beer tastes just like an almond joy; however, there is also a touch of artificial sweetener. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation; however, it all comes off a bit thin in the end. Overall, this is another exceptional framinghammer variant. Not my favorite, but quite impressive nonetheless.","Jwale73","Mar 08, 2014"
