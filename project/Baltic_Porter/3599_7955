Nice rich taste with flavors of chocolate and coffee, slightly smoky. I enjoyed the beer a lot; though I did not find myself craving another immediately - probably because I found this beer filling.

The aroma is of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and dark roasted malt. The taste follows the nose. There's some rich bittersweet chocolate and coffee with vanilla and dark roasted malt.

I've had a few of the Japanese craft brews from Hitachino Nest and was very impressed, and so far Baird seems to be an excellent brewery as well. One thing I enjoy about the Japanese renditions on porter/stouts is that they don't over do anything...just a nice complimentary blend of flavors whereas some american stouts tend to be uneven and/or too heavily hopped","Swedgin_Wu","Jan 27, 2013"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance is very dark brown to almost black in color. The only real ding I have for this brewery is the carbonation is fairly light and disappates somewhat quickly - likely due to the water. Smell is of coffee and mild cocoa - sweet aroma. Flavor is more of the same with lots of malt balance. Slight bitterness likely from the hops on the back end but the star is the up front malting.","Oakenator","Aug 19, 2012"

In the taste, a nice mellow roast, faint chocolate and a complimentary presence of tea like hops tasting pretty fresh for a bottle coming from the foot of Mt.Fuji. Roasted malt, sweet grain and a mild hop flavor, without much alcohol showing. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, somewhat smooth, but surprisingly light.

Color is a very dark brown with walnut highlights. Aroma is big malt and some roastiness plus a little caramel. Flavor's about the same but it's more sweet. A little too sweet for me.

Even slightly jammy on the nose, but not sweet. Tastes very nicely balanced with a nice roastiness, some earthy hops, a bit of ash, and some restrained dark fruit.

The taste is mild, some roasted maltiness up front and a lingering bitterness. Not much chocolate or coffee in the flavor. The carbonation seems a little high and fine, which is expected in a bottle conditioned beer. Overall, a decent beer and an average porter, but I would recommend many others over this one.","DousedInStout","Dec 13, 2008"

3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Even though Kurofune Porter is too expensive for regular consumption (and isn't widely available anyway), it's a classic English porter that is some kind of enjoyable. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Baird has up its brewing sleeve. Kampai!","BuckeyeNation","Sep 12, 2008"

4.26,12.1,5,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a frothy 2 inch tan head (the pour was a bit vigorous). Head retention and lacing are both excellent. Aroma is coffee, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some caramel malt and smoke noticable too. Very nice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit oily and smooth. Drinkability is good, the smoothness makes this easy to drink. I just bought this today, and I'm glad I drank it today too. I think it's a pretty good brew, I definitely recommend this. This is the first Baird beer I've tried, hopefully their other ones are this good too.","bluejacket74","Aug 05, 2008"

4.08,7.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Chocolate and roasty malt notes, some tobacco and mild bitterness. Even carbonation, feels very good. Fairly light, but above average in body. Overall this was very enjoyable with no flaws at all. Thanks to autumnaldave for recommending it.","emerge077","Jun 26, 2008"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark but kind of clear brown when you really look at it. Tannish/crème-ish head. Caramel malty nose. Flavor is very smooth. Caramel malts abound. Crisp and a bit dry. Very defined character, but not blazing away with things. It's nice. Feel has a lower but biting carbonation to it. Very pleasant to drink. Well done. (But not so much a Baltic Porter really)","RblWthACoz","Feb 10, 2006"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sturdy carbonation. It hits a nice stride with how I like a porter to be...not too light and not too heavy. Overall, a great smooth porter from Japan. Very glad to see this brew make it over here and I hope more Japanese beers make it this way, as there are brewers doing great things there!","orbitalr0x","Jun 16, 2004"

4.2,10.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Intense black color, with a very dense creamy head and a nice lacing. The smell shows some red fruits, oranges, chocolate, trufle like, some milk chocolate powder. The taste is of roasted coffee, with hints of smoke, chocolate and oranges, and still some red fruits. THe mouthfeel is great: the beer's almost melting in the mouth; a bit powdery with the chocolate thing, but it's not a problem, it's even enjoyable. Quite drinkable.","tjd25","May 30, 2004"
