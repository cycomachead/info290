They have other beers named similarly and they don't match style. I drank the beer and was the first craft beer I ever poured down the drain. It was weak in flavor and lacked everything a porter needs. I was more disappointed that the beer deceived me than the taste. But over all its a bad beer.","blckwiteboy","Aug 13, 2014"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, dark bread, light coffee, light licorice, herbal, and roast/toasty earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, raisin, plum, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and fairly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Baltic porter. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 09, 2014"

Putting delusions of grandeur aside, this hits the mark as a quite good porter in the American style, what once was called the "robust porter" category. Pours a tarry black with a caramel-tinged moderate head. Big roasted flavors with distinct coffee and semi-sweet chocolate notes. Creamy mouthfeel and firm hopping bat cleanup. Does not push into the harder roasted malt notes common to the Baltic porter, which is okay here. Nicely done.","Brent","Aug 05, 2010"

3.85,-2.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Feel and Drinkability: Body is much thinner than I expected it to be, kinda disappointed here. It goes down way to easy is is much too light. It needs some weight to it. The carbonation is light a fine, delicate and it works to bring out acidity, slight tartness and the implication of cherries. Followed by this is the sour mash thing, then in the finish that alcohol deal, astringency from alcohol. I like how the carbonation works here, very nice. However, I really think that the body could use some weight to it, it seems to just be to thin, I want a full bodied porter, especially if on the back of the label it's talking about deathly cold winters...I want something thick and heavy. Its easy to drink, and I find that to be a problem. It goes down to smooth, body is too light and I'd prefer to sip on it, but the body doesn't warrent that. Sure I'll enjoy the rest of it, but I'm not sure that I'd go looking for this one. Give it a go, I'm glad I did but I've had better.","becktone","Feb 14, 2010"

There is plenty of sweetish dark malts, crystal malts as well, almost a slight nutty flavor emerges. There isn't the tough boozy or chewy quality that you find with other BPs. The body is much more medium bodied than is typical for the style. There is less assertiveness here, less creaminess, just a lighter and sweeter beer than many other BPs. There is no boozy quality and the 7% or so ABV is well hidden. This beer isn't particularly warming. It is a sweet porter that is plenty drinkable but not brilliant.","albern","Dec 23, 2009"

Dark malt dominates the flavor, a mild bitterness on the finish that i wouldnt quite call a true "hop character' in this one.

Similarly, there was lots of malt in the nose though not a complex aroma. The payoff, however, was in the taste: a rich, full sample of malt, coffee, and chocolate flavors very much in line with the porter style. There was not a lot of hops but there was clearly a hopsy bitterness to the aftertaste. As they say, "It's in dere," even though the style of this brew is much more in the British mold of lots of malt, not a lot of hops. BA website says 7.5% ABV, Southampton's website says 7.8%, and some other sites say 7.0%. In any case, there is a noticable alcohol heat to the late taste, though of course nothing like a barley wine. I liked this one. I learned that Southhampton is now owned by Anheuser-Busch.

The flavours include coffee, caramel, plum and ash, all in a nice balance, although I would have preferred them to be a bit bigger. Despite initial impressions, this is not a big beer, and while it does lack the assertiveness of a higher ABV brew it does have more balance and doesn't descend into booziness. In fact, the alcohol is well-hidden, but does gradually numbs the tongue in a way that I've found unique to baltic porters.

After sampling many a baltic porter (thanks to the selection at Eagle Provisions), I have to say that this one falls short of whatever the mark may be. A little too thin in maturity. Feel is good. Nice level of bubble and that thicker liquid feel. Very drinkable of course.

While this wasn't it, it was certainly an enjoyable brew. The smell was a nice pure dark malt aroma, no hops to be found. Color was solid dark dark reddish brown like a porter ought to be. There wasn't much head though, and it didn't last. The taste was a nice, sweet mix of licorice and molasses but not much else. I was expecting chocolate, or some fruit perhaps. The mouthfeel was really nice though, a chewy smoothness with fine carbonation. No bitterness to speak of made it very easy to drink.

After a few sips the caramel and chocolate roastiness are almost exclusive in the flavor, which are rather pleasant. Relatively full-bodied, though not as full as many stouts and porters, and definitely not full enough to hurt the drinkability. This beer goes down pretty easily. It's worth mentioning too that the alcohol is virtually non-existent in the aroma, mouthfeel, or flavor. Wow, what a nice beer. I can see myself going back to this one over and over again.

The smell was too sweet, buttery, and thin for what I expect from the style. Toffee & caramel seemed to dominate, a bit of plum in there too, and a very faint coffee. Not what I was expecting. I found that the toffee dominated my tasting of it as well -- possible that this batch was heavy on the diacetyl? The sweetness is somewhat balanced by a slight coffee bitterness and a subtle earthy hop.

More of the aforementioned malts bringing thick chocolate flavors to the front of the palate and staying smooth throughout. The alcohol warmth adds to the superb finish, in my opinion the high point of this fine beer. Full body and a smooth texture that refuses to let go of the cheeks.

Taste was every bit as delectable as the smell with syrupy dark fruit, chocolate, tobacco, licorice, with a backing of mustyness that brought all of the flavors together. It seems to start off feeling somewhat light on the palate, but by the time it comes to swallowing, you realize that this is a pretty big porter...not robust by any means but still full bodied. As far as drinkability, I think i could down these until the wee hours of the morning. I like how it resembles a quality English Porter while upping the flavors and giving it a fuller body and personality. Highly reccomend this brew. It's like sex in a bottle","jamie2dope","Jun 18, 2006"

4.05,2.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a very good, classic baltic porter with few "bells and whistles". Appearance is quite dark, but a shade shy of black, with a decent head raised upon pouring that dissipates quickly. The beer smells of roasted malts, sweet malts, and a touch of dark fruits, but it's not a particularly assertive nose. On the palate, the first sensation is pinpricks of carbonation on the tip of the tongue, followed by bitter roasted malts, then sweet malts popping up on the back of the tongue. The taste isn't terribly complex, but it's quite solid. Southampton's Imperial Porter is very smooth, with the emphasis squarely on malts. It's a solid example of the style. No complaints.","geexploitation","Apr 13, 2006"

It's generally smooth enough but as it warms it starts to unevenly display its alcohol and a sticky sweetness that doesn't do wonders for the brew.

The color is exceedingly dark, a black-brown base with fleeting crimson accents. The aroma is of intensely roasted malt, with a smokey quality and a dark, ripe fruit smell. Raisins and plum, coffee, chocolate, and a waft or two of alcohol. The taste is notable dry, surprisingly so considering the aroma. Astringent and somewhat light-to-medium body (for the style). Theres a little bready-yeastiness in the taste, but the wonderful aroma gets lost somewhere between the nose and the mouth. It could certainly use a lot more body. The finish is a little bitter, and notably dry. This ones worth seeking out, but its not as good as it could be.","Suds","Mar 13, 2006"

Tasted of sweet fruity bananas and black fruit along with a nice dryness on the tongue that brought out hints of cocoa and nuts. Unfortunately there was a metallic nip in the finish, but that didnt detract too much from the over all appeal. The mouth feel was medium bodied with a light creamy carbonation.

Pours a deep brown to black with a nice khaki head which never fully recedes. Smells of a bit of roast, raisiny, and interestingly enough with a whack of scotch? Flavor echoes this and more. Initially there's a beefy roasted note, not at all sharp or bitter, but smooth and sweet, then it widens into a deep, dark fruitiness with raisins, currants, earth, molasses, dried berries. A touch of milk chocolate Then it dries a bit and becomes roastier, darker chocolates evolving in the finish. Lingers on the palate forever. Hops are barely, if at all noticeable.

The smell is of roasted chocolate and nuts, followed by a whiff on caramel malty sweetness that almost salivates your mouth. The taste finally! hits you with some slight carbonation, then the taste of chocolate with some fig fruit essence, it starts on your palate with some caramel sweetness then gives you a little bittersweet chocolate hop finish.

Velvet like smoothness is apparant from the start. Silky smooth. With a body checking in around medium, this beer is extremely drinkable. And the great flavor doesn't hurt either.

I believe I may have chilled this a bit too much, as I can tell that there is a lot more in the aromatics hiding beneath the chill. The taste is one of dark roasted cocoa bean intermingled with espresso and a touch of oak, vanilla and a hint of bourbon. The balance of acid and sweetness from the malts are superb. You would think from the menacing look of this brew that it would be heavy and overpowering, but it is naughtactually very tame and manageable, with a profound flavor profile; you will not tire easily from this selection. The mouthfeel is well balanced, moderate in weight and totally perfect for this creation.

A smooth, full bodied beer that delivers plenty of flavor without being sticky. I really like the contrast between dark roasted malts and deep vinuous flavors. I'll be picking up a few more for the cool fall days to come.","HappyHourHero","Aug 10, 2005"
3.85,-2.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This Porter pours nice and dark out of the bottle. There is an ample head. The smell is rather pleasantly malty. The taste is of a toffee-coffee combo. A smooth and relatively rich mouth feel. A Porter worth giving a try, most definitely. But nothing exceptional.","BadBadger","Aug 07, 2005"
4.5,14.2,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Poured a rich dark brown/black color, with very little in the way of a head. Faint aroma, mostly malty. Taste is wonderful; quite sweet, with a significant flavor of toffee and chocolate blending with the roast malt base. Extremely drinkable, this is a much lighter beer than it first let's on. My first experience with Southampton beers, and they certainly made a great first impression.","medic25","Aug 06, 2005"
4.08,3.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This is spot on for a Baltic style Porter, rich and malty with ample notes of chocolate and roast (but not as much as an Imperial Stout) and a smooth rounded fermentation character typical of a Lager type yeast (or at least a non-descript Ale yeast). This beer is quite enjoyable with enough complexity to keep me entertained yet not so much that I become distracted from over the top flavors, and it is just the perfect beer to enjoy in a 22oz serving.","Gueuzedude","Aug 04, 2005"
3.92,-0.5,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"The smell is very nice, consisting of strong roasted malt along with chocolate, caramel, and light hints of vanilla and alcohol. The taste comes through as well, with these flavors tasted up front before hops clean up the finish. The mouthfeel doesn't seem to measure up, not being nearly as smooth or hearty as expected.","watermelonman","Jul 27, 2005"

3.05,-22.6,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Near black pour with a lace at the edges, dark brown, but no head otherwise. The complete lack of head, not even fading head, dissapoints. Toasty malt on the nose, a bit of coffee-like tones but very subtle. A bit too subtle. Very light on taste too; generally porter-ish with nothing imperial about it that I can identify. Very smooth, good density. Drinkable but not remarkable.","packetknife","Jul 15, 2005"

A lot of chocolate in this one. Raisen like with a hint of burnt caramel. Good body-fairly smoothe with a slight alcohol burn to finish. A very enjoyable beer. I wasnt all that impressed when first poured but as the bottle went down and I could sit back and comtemplate it, it really grew on me. Nice job. Thanks a bunch to irishredrock for the bottle.","lackenhauser","Jul 13, 2005"
4.01,1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Beer pours a solid black color with a very sparse coat over top. Not much head action at all. The nose is a little light for my liking. I get a bit of fig, light chocolate, touch of brown sugary sweetness. Its good, but not as powerful as I would like it to be. Flavor is also not as bold as I would expect. Good roasted, slightly burnt character with a sweet fig character balances with a light molases sweetness. I like it. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Drinkability is very good. No hint of the alcohol. I enjoy it. Nice beer.","kmpitz2","Jul 10, 2005"
4.54,15.2,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Damn Kev, thanks for sharin' ho! 22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a dark jet black color with one finger of medium tan head. The smell is just incredible. It has this rich caramel sweetness that no other beer has been able to match. Hints of toffee and alcohol meld in there, and it just seems perfect for me. Even a hint of wood is coming out as it warms. The taste is full of coffee, chocolate, and caramel (aka awesome!). A hint of vanilla bean and alcohol on the finish. Brilliant. The mouthfeel is just a little light and oily. The drinkability is great for 7.5%. A damn tasty beer, thanks again Kev!","SheepNutz","Jul 09, 2005"

3.97,0.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Deep dark brown, red highlights, quickly disappearing head. Smells of roasted malts, alcohol hints, and I've smelled this in a few other beers, so I'm not crazy, but I smell fresh paint. Yep. Nice rich taste, almost stout-like. I'm picking up on some dark cherries and other fruit, some chocolaty malts, carmel, and that odd taste of the way paint smells, which is the most interesting thing about this beer. Decent mouthfeel and drinkability, I'll have no problems finishing off this bomber. Overall a good beer. I've never had anything from Southampton before and was surprised to see some stuff in my local store, but, maybe I was anticipating it too much, as it's often talked up on this site and their beers get great reviews, but I didn't find this to be as exceptional as I was expecting. Don't take that the wrong way though, it's still a great beer. I'd like to try more from this place.","twelvsies","May 04, 2005"

4.5,14.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was from a 22oz 2004 edition bottle with black foil wrapped cap, sampled on 12/17/04. This pours out a pitch black with a huge light tan head being fed by constant bubbles rising to the top. The head sticks around for a while leaves rings and clumps of lace around the glass. Thick chocolate covered aroma with plenty of dark ripe fruitiness underneath. Notes of roastiness, coffee and other things all mix in as well for one rich delicious smelling beer. Taste starts off with bittersweet dark chocolate cover fruitiness. Roasted malt and coffee were both present in good quantities. Ends on a chocolate covered fruit note, very pleasant. Body is a little more than medium with a creamy smooth feel in you mouth and going down. Very tasty stuff that I could put down all day, easy drinking for me. Such a tasty brew that you should definitely pick it up if you come across it. Thanks to slander for giving me the chance to sample this.","meathookjones","Sep 11, 2004"

Never too sweet. Nice cacao powder touch. Gentle roastiness. Ultra-balanced. Big fruity flavors complement the malt richness (plum-pudding, dates). Great powdery mouthfeel, incredibly smooth and moderately to highly carbonated. Superbly delicate malt, round. Light bitterness, bready and roasted nuts reminiscent.

The taste is sweet and bitter up front with some nice strong coffee notes, and some roasted malt notes in the middle. The finish is raw and hoppy with some biting booziness and some awesome bitterness as well. The mouthfeel was a bit thick, but it was medium bodied for an imperial porter. The drinkability was also quite good. This is a very good imperial porter, and an awesome beer, but i've definately had better from SPH!","francisweizen","Mar 24, 2004"
