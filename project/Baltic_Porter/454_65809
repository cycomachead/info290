4.29,2.6,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"huge fan of the style, i say that a lot, but this bourbon barrel edition has to be one of the most decadent beverages going. at 12% abv and with enough boozy sweetness to render its lager yeast past a distant memory. a half shade lighter than shiny black shoe polish, the head surges near the rim of the glass on the pour, and only relaxes slowly. it smells incredible, dry fruity must, the wood is very very prominent, and the lack of bitterness in the malt base means the sweetness of the bourbon is high. they may have overshot the grain bill just a bit, as this beastly bodied brew has enough sugar to keep on going up. good bourbon barrels i suspect, as there are no weird thin fusel notes on this, and the charcoal aspect is there all the way. ashy almost burnt malt flavor in the middle, before it gives way to traces of rum, licorice, and espresso. potting soil earthiness to it as well before the sugars come on. the alcohol is very strong, no denying that, i wonder what lager yeast they used to get it here. the science is as interesting as the final product. a bold but elegant brew on the whole, my first form arcadia. maybe not my favorite baltic porter, as the thing that makes that style awesome is paved over a bit here, but the beer is of astounding quality. id like to cellar one awhile. thanks to thebrewo for opening this one with me!","StonedTrippin","Mar 07, 2015"

3.87,-7.4,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bottle. Let it warm-up a bit from fridge temperature. The beer is a nearly opaque black-brown with red highlights. There was a scant dark brown head. The aroma is fairly typical of a barrel aged beer: oak and bourbon with a hint of sweet malt -- and virtually no hops. The taste follows, but the oak and bourbon are slightly downplayed compared to other similar barrel aged beers, letting more of the porter's character to shine through. As a result, some roasty malt is evident. The body is medium with medium-light carbonation. Overall, this is more what I'm looking for in a barrel aged beer: less of the cloying oak and bourbon sweetness that is characteristic of many others. Too bad it's so pricey, so this one will remain a special treat.","breakingbland","Beers"

This beer is an absolute treat, but at $8 a single, it makes me hesitate... but it also makes me wonder, why do I think twice about getting a 12oz bottle for $8, but I don't double take at the price of $18-$20 for a 22oz bomber?","Alextricity","Dec 26, 2014"

It seems the roasted malt character just doesn't have the same strength that it would have in a similar stout, and thus gets lost a little. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, just heavy on the bourbon flavors with complimentary porter characteristics (and not the other way around, like it usually goes). Very oaky in general too, if that's your sort of thing.","Dope","Apr 03, 2014"

Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, vanilla, bourbon, oak, clove, coconut, and roasted/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, vanilla, toast, caramel, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, dark bread, light coconut, and roasted/oak earthiness. Light earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, raisin, toast, toffee, caramel, dark bread, bourbon, oak, clove, and roasted/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible depth, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with and awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged porter! All around awesome depth and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 09, 2014"

4.2,0.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma and its flavoring. The aroma takes the bourbon barrel aged aspect of this guy all the way, to the point of boxing many of the other components out, just so it can be seen and appreciated. The flavor, while inclusive of the wonderful, warming, oaky, bourbon glory, leaves much more room for the base and the rest of the beer to blend and show through. The balance is actually great, but may be a touch to boozy for the unseasoned. This beer marks our introduction to Arcadiaâ€™s barrel program, and only makes us more excited about Shipwreckâ€™s brethren. This is one beer that certainly lives up to the hype in every category, and we are ever so grateful to have finally gotten to experience this local gem.","TheBrewo","Sep 21, 2013"

This was not a typical whiskey aroma, which should have been my first clue that something was wrong. The initial taste was the smooth yet biting sensation of alcohol. Rather than drinking beer, it felt like I had a mouth full of cheap whiskey. Amidst, the burn were hints of a bunred dark malt, vanilla, and dark fruit. These pleasant notes could not overcome the burn of the alcohol in my mouth that continued to burn in the aftertaste. There was no sense of balance to this beer.

It features a lot of sweet vanilla and sweet bourbon. The sweetness is high enough to overpower any chocolate or coffee that would normally be present. If you're looking for a lot of barrel sweetness though, this is your thing. The flavors begin with a boatload of vanilla then heads into light bourbon, sweet cream, toffee, smooth chocolate and whipping cream. Its a big improvement from the nose and features a lot of complexity. I'm quite impressed. The flavors are just so creamy and smooth and perfectly integrated. The aftertaste is phenomenal, like creamed coffee. It drinks medium in body and doesn't show the 12% at all. Overall this is a really nice beer.

Although this beer is heavy on the bourbon flavor, it's far from one dimensional with lots of rich malt flavor underneath. Toasty with hints of chocolate, caramel, toffee and oatmeal. There's some subtle heat with nice warmth in the finish but overall the high ABV is very well masked.

The nose comprises bourbon, oak, light roasted malts, and a dusting of cocoa powder. There's some minor heat in the background, but not enough to warm the nose uncomfortably. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some dark chocolate, light molasses, and a distinctive heavy touch of licorice. The licorice detracts a bit with its strength (rather than helping things by blending in better with the rest of the flavors).

Body is oddly thin and boozy also. Seems like the alcohol got a little too rampant, the barrel obliterated the nuances of the original Porter. Wafting heat rises off the palate, leaving a bone dry finish with some lingering roast malt in the aftertaste, but it lacks nuance and depth.

The taste is a combination of big oak and a small, melded bourbon heat, cocoa, malts, and a finsh of bitterness that seems like a combination of the 50 some IBUs and the tannic, oak quality. This beer isn't boozy in the same way at BA beers can be boozy, and yet the big oak and the bourbon are aggressive. It's somewhat hard to explain how this beer comes together, but it oddly does for me. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than desired, with reasonable lower carbonation.

The taste is good. a good integration of the caramel and bourbon, with the latter only mildly showing up in the aftertaste. Hardly any sweetness at all, with some bitterness in the finish.

Here goes a 12 ounce of the Barrel Aged 12% version. Pours a pitch black hue with a thicket of tan head dwindles slow and leaves chunks of scattered lacing. Aroma has a full on bourbon nose, with hints of caramel/vanilla creaminess. Dark roasted malts provide a touch of black chocolate but is pretty much overshadowed by the bourbon barrel aging. Touch of oak and strong sweet bourbon notes, I'm thinking you really have to love bourbon to drink this beer. To compare this to KBS is unfair, two totally different types of BBA beers. Flavor is full of intense booze and bourbon flavors, that 12 percent is packing some heat instead of abv I feel like I should be talking what proof this is. The base porter doesn't stand up to the barrel, it totally absorbs all of the bourbon barreal effects inlcuding toasted/charred oak, sweet bourbon, hints of vanilla/caramelized dark sugars. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is low, I'm sure alot is lost during barrel aging. Head formed nicely though I'm not calling this flat in anyway. A warming effect with each sip from the 12 percent abv or 24 proof. Overall you better like you some bourbon or your not going to care for this particular beer, I could give a non bourbon drinker a KBS but if I gave this one to them they may be a bit offended by the straight up bourbon character if their not used to it.","WVbeergeek","Apr 28, 2011"

4.32,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall - As far as barrel aged beers go, you can get much better then this. Strong whiskey flavor mixed into a porter really makes a fine beer. A total sipper at 12%, one and done for sure. A real treat and worth finding in a bottle.","wvsabbath","Apr 15, 2011"

I have the cellar stocked with 20 of these gems, and will likely reduce that number in half by the time I have arbitrarily set as what I feel will be the next time I will revisit the "aged" version of this beer a year from now. My one main hope for perfection of this brew is to tame the oak flavors that seem to be a little overpowering to the Vanilla, which is the most pleasant flavor of this beer.","Jparkanzky","Apr 14, 2011"

4.37,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!!). Pours near balck with thin khaki head. Aroma has lots of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and some wood. Taste is semi-sweet-not as much as the nose-and it has some roasty bitterness. The flavors are complex with wood, vanilla, dark pit fruit and some coffee stealing the show. The bourbon is not as pronounced as I would have thought through the aroma. Medium bodied with a dry, woody finish. This is a really nice beer","trappistlover","Apr 06, 2011"

4.47,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Medium body, with a great lighter carbonation, which works very well for this style. Alcohol is felt, but not at the expected level for the strength.

I think I may want a stronger roasted body. It may have a disconnect for me. Something more fluid and more velvet? I just find myself wanting somewhere. The flavor is off the hook, but the feeling just isn't up to par. Either way, good beer. Would gladly drink it again.","Khazadum","Mar 27, 2011"

This beer was just sent to me and I can't imagine what a year or two on it would do. It is already practically quaffable for how strong it is. I was hoping not to be let down by this, being a porter lover, and I was most definitely not. I would seek this out in the future for sure. This beer is just SO smooth...I just took a few minute break before posting this to let it warm up even more and my god does it keep getting better as it warms and with every sip.

4.12,-1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This pours a very dark brown with a small, thin khaki head that died away leaving just traces of lace. On the nose, the bourbon, vanilla, and oak are the big three notes, but underneath that is a backbone of roasted malt, some earthiness, and a big of booze. In the mouth, the bourbon takes up residence right on the mid part of the tongue and hangs around, well, forever. There is also a bit of toasted malt, and a big, oaky finish. The alcohol presence is pretty huge, but that's not something to complain about with a bourbon barrel beer. The feel is a slightly sticky medium body, not as thick as some of the bigger stouts that seem heavier on oats, coffee, and chocolate than this beer. Overall I wish this beer had just a bit of a bigger backbone as the bourbon flavors dominated the base beer pretty well, but the end result is pretty great and well worth seeking out.","EricCioe","Mar 13, 2011"

Lots of whiskey in the aroma along with a little alcohol. Chocolate, vanilla in the flavor. Not as much Bourbon as the aroma would suggest. Long, lingering finish of chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Body is a little thin. Definitely a sipper. Good beer, plenty of complexity, not just a bunch of bourbon.","homebrewhawk","Mar 12, 2011"

4.32,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The most striking part of the taste is that the bourbon barrel flavor is nearly perfect. The full, round bourbon, vanilla and wood notes are front and center, but without the heat that it usually takes to get those flavors to the fore. There is some bitter bakers chocolate and sweet molasses in a supporting role. I wish there was a bit more roast from the parent beer here, but this is as spot-on of a barrel aging process as you're going to find. You really get the full character of the barrel. Very well done.","chicagobeerriot","Mar 11, 2011"

Pours two shades shy of black with no head, just a soapy swirl and some residual suds. Nose expresses vanilla, coconut, butter and artificial sweetener on a medium-roasted malty backbone. Taste consistent with nose; however, the vanilla is much more prominent in the flavor profile than in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation. A decent beer, but the artificial sweetener present in the nose and taste are a bit too much for my liking.","Jwale73","Feb 18, 2011"
