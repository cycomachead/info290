3.36,-11.8,4,3,3.75,3,3,"The bottle opened with a very strong rush of air. Not a gusher, but it's hard to pour without excessive head. When in the glass, it does look good - a toasty brown and black color with a khaki head. There is something off about the smell, I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's a bit more acrid than I would like. The taste is moderately roasty with some nice acidic notes; tastes pretty style-appropriate to me. Mouthfeel isn't up to par, the massive amounts of carbonation are overwhelming the medium/heavy body. Overall, it's a miss.","bcm75","Feb 25, 2015"

The thing is (and here I go blowing my hot air) that it really has the taste of the other Dark Horse dark beers. There is something identifiable in the recipe that one can specifically say is Dark Horse, as it is a profile that they have in their other beers. And that is not to say it is a bad thing - it is refreshing to drink something that you know where it came from and it is a trait that they carry over from brewing to brewing - and its nice to have a consistent friend to come back to from time to time.","charadrius_cerevisiae","Jan 07, 2015"
4.15,8.9,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"This is a fairly complex porter, that disguises each note until the beer warms up. Chocolate malts and brown sugar/molasses forward. Dark fruit and anise notes come out in the back end. Think of a dried fruit covered in bakerâ€™s chocolate. Thin in body yet creamy in mouthfeel - toes the line between porter and stout quite well. The 7% is not overly noticeable here.","Barnoloid","Jan 05, 2015"

It's a total campfire, sit and roast marshmallows, cuddle up and read a book (I sound like a friggin' girl), or comfortably watch MacGuyver (there we go, that's more man-like) beer. It's very roasted, very chocolate-coffee, and very dark beer all at the same time. One of the better porters I've had.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 13, 2014"

3.52,-7.6,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A vigorous pour led to a pseudo-cascade which settled into a finger of frothy, deep-tan head with limited retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose was very roasty with a deep charcoal aspect. Say, is the Trout a Stout? Hmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very much of charcoal and dark chocolate. Finish was semi-dry with the roastiness leaving a bitter, smoky flavor as its aftertaste. This beer leaves me with a conundrum, since it is not really what I would consider a porter, but more towards a stout. I did not dislike it, but it was not really what I was expecting, either. I guess that you will have to try one and gauge it for yourself.","woodychandler","Jul 10, 2014"

I also get a lager yeast vibe, especially in the crisped up finish, but maybe my palate is playing tricks on me. a good porter overall, on par with the other quality dark horse brews, but this one didn't stand out to me the way some of the others did. maybe just a little light for the style in winter time.","StonedTrippin","Dec 21, 2013"

This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, with lots of nice roasted flavors that really held my attention and the alcohol was hardly noticeable, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these, it would make for a nice beer to have by the campfire, one of the most drinkable Baltic Porters I have tried. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was and how drinkable it was, those aspects really made this a nice beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there was nothing that I thought was out of place or needed to be improved on. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a nice and roasty beer, I consider it a bargain for $1,89 and you can be sure that I will be stocking up on some in the near future, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Porters and Stouts. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it's one damn good Baltic Porter and I would put it right up there with Bridge Brew Works Baltic Porter as my favorite of the style, they are both very good but this one is a little more drinkable. Dark Horse can make some pretty damn good beers and this is no exception, I'm glad they finally decided to bottle this, it's a great addition to their lineup and it will be a great addition to my fridge, great works guys, this one's a winner.","StoutHunter","Jan 15, 2013"

Barely enough bitterness in the finish. Just medium bodied, with adequate carbonation. The only thing preventing an excepetional in drinkability is the slight over sweetness.

The aroma is that of malted milk balls. The taste interesting. There is a definite coffee/expresso taste present that borders on burnt coffee and finishes as such, bringing down its drinkability score to the average range.","proc","Mar 09, 2004"

2.85,-25.2,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"This one was super dark in appearance and the head was almost totally absent from my vigorous pour. Where is the carbonation? The smell is intense roastiness. The taste brings about a burnt coffee/espresso flavor that I feel is too blunt. Chocolate mixes slightly as well as some earthy flavors. This one is too one sided and intense to really be enjoyed. Not a bad offering but I was hoping for more from Dark Horse here.","granger10","Jan 03, 2004"
