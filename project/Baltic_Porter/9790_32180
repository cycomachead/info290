Taste-wise it is very similar to the aroma. The body is not overly heavy and has a nice smooth finish.","delta490","Feb 27, 2015"

Beer is light to medium bodied, smooth, even a little oaky/woody, more sweet than roasted with a slight overbalance of chocolate (possible vanilla) sugary sweetness over roasted malts.  Nonetheless, well crafted beer that controls itself, has a clean finish that complements rest of beer and the ABV is well-hidden (no idea it was this high).","clayrock81","Jan 16, 2015"

It's nicely colored, but its plum, cherry, and raisin flavors are - to my palate - truly excessive, almost resulting in a cough-syrupy sweetness.

Nose of rich date, molasses, and bittersweet baker's chocolate. Flavors are rich and roasted, with bitter chocolate and black strap molasses forward, with hints of smoke and charred wood character. Rich and perfectly balanced on a smooth, robust body. The aftertaste is richly sweet, with hints of smoke throughout. Slick finish, with a roasted linger.

The beer has a smell that demonstrates its funk but mixes well with the dark chocolate notes that also have some cocoa hints in it. The beer taste resembles the smell but with a stronger funk that mixes well with the cocoa and dark chocolate notes. The funk is a bit tarty and sour that might not appeal to some tastes. The mouthfeel is slick with biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Baltic Porter and worth getting again.","HattedClassic","Jun 04, 2013"

The nose features aroma of cocoa powder and black licorice, and while the former is dominant, the latter definitely has its fair say as well. The dark chocolate that leads off the flavor profile is exceedingly smooth, I actually find myself wishing there was just a little bit of a roasty edge to it. The star anise that follows is joined by a light earthy hop presence to form the finish. The body is surprisingly not heavy for a big porter, and that combined with the lack of appreciable alcohol makes this one impressively drinkable. The modest, understated carbonation just completes the picture. Baltic Porter is just another entry in a very solid lineup from Duck Rabbit. Now, if they would just bottle The End of Reason...","axeman9182","Dec 26, 2012"

Smell is a bit tame with some notes of coffee, carmel, roasted malts and some earth tones. Subtle on the nose. Taste was where this brew hooked me. A very balanced porter that hides the 9% quite well. Initial coffee and chocolate that fades to earth and nuts with a hint of hops. Pretty complex and smooth. Comes off a bit more like a stout than porter. Feel was a bit of a letdown. A touch watery and thin. It did have a silk feel on the tongue and perhaps the 6 weeks had something to do with this. Adequate carbonation, but a little light on the feel. Overall- I really enjoyed this beer. Solid blend of malts, coffee, chocolate and earth. Well hidden ABV and tough to set down. A nice sipper for a winter evening. Again, this comes off as a stout to me, but it's a damn good beer and I will be trying one out of the bottle soon-","TheDinger","Nov 23, 2012"

Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had a dried dark-fruit scent, like prunes, raisins, dried blueberries, you get the idea. Mouthfeel was medium and the alcohol heat was the first thing that was evident on the tongue. Getting past that, it was really like a fruitcake with lots of dried fruit flavors like the aforementioned as well as cherries plus a nice maltiness.

Not as smokey or brine-heavy as Scandinavian takes on the style, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate that this comes in 12oz bottles, as that seems like the appropriate serving size - I think more would become fatiguing and burdensome for one person.","MasterSki","Jan 11, 2012"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a big one and a half finger milk chocolate head with some small bubbles and some big bubbles. I'm surprised at this, but I can hear the head fizzing, not a good sign usually. The head isn't going away super fast, but it's for sure dissipating. The body is absolutely pitch black, no light is getting through, even when held up to the light. Lacing is excellent, it just sticks to the side of the glass. Overall, an ok look, not as good as I was expecting, mainly the head was not as good as I was expecting, but the body looks solid. Nice roasted malt on the nose, chocolate is also present for sure. It smells slightly sweet, slightly bitter, I also detect a small amount of alcohol kick underneath the initial smell. It smells pretty solid, it smells like there may even be some other scents in here that I can't quite identify, so perhaps more complex, either way I can tell it's going to be a quality made and quality tasting beer. Wow the taste was not what I was expecting at all, this tastes like an oatmeal stout to me, oatmeal is very present. It's also very sweet, perhaps a little too sweet, the malts are present, but not as roasty as I was hoping, more sweet than anything. There is a little bitter/sourness on the flavor. It's a good brew, don't get me wrong, it's just a little too sweet and not as complex as I would have hoped, a little one sided. I do however get a nice taste in the middle of the drink that I can't quite identify, maybe dark fruit, it's very yummy though. So I guess it's a little complex, just not nearly complex as I would like. They do a very nice job of masking that 9% though, I can hardly taste the alcohol at all, I mean you know it's there because you can taste the sweetness and you can feel the alcohol when you drink it, but it's not an offensive alcohol taste. I keep getting this taste in the middle of the beer, it's really nice, it's like a cinnamon, candy, maybe even cake taste, it's so bazaar because it's so subtle I can barely pick up on it, but it's very nice. The mouthfeel on this beer is decent, it's thin in some areas and big in others, so that's a little disappointing, but the carbonation is just right. Drinkability is honestly better than it should be for 9%, with that being said it's still not the easiest beer to drink. Overall it's a good beer, is it the best porter I've ever had? No way, but it's good. The beer all around is too sweet, but it has some nice factors and I really liked that middle flavor I kept picking up on.","MaltsOfGlory","May 08, 2011"

It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is quite the excellent brew. If I'm honest it tasted slightly better out of the bottle I had in the past, but it is definitely no slouch on tap. The dark chocolate aspect was just more robust out the bottle from what I remember.

4.07,-0.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to BucketBoy for the generous extra. 12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a quarter inch, loose, mocha-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets. Head quickly disperses towards the shoulders before dissipating into a thin band around the edges. No lacing on this one. Big bold nose - chocolate and dark fruit reminiscent of grape juice. There's also a slight bubblegum character. Taste is a bit more subdued than suggested by the nose and there is a slightly oxidized character and some acidity in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a prickly carbonation and a slight acidity. Definitely a solid Baltic Porter, but doesn't touch my go to BP - Smuttynose. I would, however, love the opportunity to try this on tap.

Due to the higher ABV a sweet alcohol aroma can be smelled as well it gives a honey whiskey aroma to the mix. The taste is both a bit boozy and smokey. Both of those flavors in balance really make up the brew. The coffee essence is mild. This beer is a lot sweeter than I would have assumed the baltic porter would be. The mouthfeel is a bit all over the place. It's not nearly as thick as it seems to have poured and I feel that it could be carbonated a little bit more, but overall it's not that bad.

The nose comprises molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, spruce tips, roasted malts, plums, and a bit o' chocolate. The taste follows very closely, though the plums and spruce tips are swallowed alive by the brown sugar and molasses midstroke. Still, the spiciness mixes well with the syrups and roasted malts, which is what you're lookin' fer in a baltic porter.

The aroma is unremarkable, with just a bit of crisp sweetness and just the slightest touch of booze. Where this one stands out is in the flavor and texture. Richly sweet, with flavors of bittersweet chocolate and molasses, and an underlying bitterness akin to a lightly roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is silky smooth.

There is also some consistency issues with this beer...I've had a few over the years that were off, even beyond the sourness it picks up over time, as well as one that was completely flat and not very good at all (guessing it wasn't capped properly). This loses a lot of its luster as you get to the bottom of the glass. Overall incredibly flavorful, and packs quite a punch, feels like 11%, but I think it's a little over-rated.

The aroma was a little unusual in that the dominant aroma was the acidity. I thought we might be onto something with this beer. The dark malt lends hints of chocolate and some smoke. Unfortunately the taste does not live up to the aroma. Seems to be a very middle of the road porter with a high ABV. The only thing that makes this rememberable is the slight acidity in the finish. The malt just does not seem to be there. There are hints of chocolate and smoke but I want much more especially with this ABV. The body is just better than average and that is saved by the nice carbonation. Just seems a very average Baltic Porter. It definately would not offend anyone.","morimech","Dec 22, 2009"

The aroma is a dead ringer for an RIS. Huge Hershey's chocolate syrup notes with coffee, black patent malt and just a bit of toffee. The taste is just as big as the aroma. Chocolate and black patent malts dominate the flavors with hints of astringent espresso and molasses, bit of vanilla and toffee. This beer has a great flavor. The mouthfeel is the only thing that really reminds me more of a Baltic Porter rather then an Russian Imperial Stout. It's a bit thin and finishes exceptionally dry, for a big beer.

Slight alcohol warming in the finish and leaves you lingering with that burnt bitterness that lingers. Almost has that milk stout texture but with this weird underlying belgian fruit flavor(raisons and something else can't pick it out).

A very nice blend in the aroma, and I sometimes am not a fan of detecting the alcohol in the scent. Taste is what made this for me. Love the robust flavor that mixes the obvious malts, but also a mix of a coffee flavor, and the alcohol, with a sour bite after you take a sip. Sweet to sour flavor as you drink is awesome.

Smell is a deep roasty, sticky, teriyaki/soy like sweetness. I got pretty much only hearty smells and no dried fruity sweet aromas from this one. As it warms it smells more and more smoky, soy-like and like liquified smoked beef jerky. Reminds me a lot of Flying Dog Gonzo Porter. Taste is rich, with similar smoky roasty mildly tart/sweet soy flavors. Mouthfeel is perfect. Carbonated lightly, and the body is rich, thick, creamy and velvety smooth. The alcohol is also extremely well hidden for 9 %, but the almost "savory" like heartiness and the smoky, meaty flavor I got from it would keep this from being a beer I personally could drink again and again.

Flavors bring out dark roasted malts with tart raisin fruitiness and brown sugar caramelized sweetness going on, more milk chocolate malted Whoppers coming in with toffee and strong bitter black roasts as well, finishes with a touch of fruity booziness and a herbal hop bouquet. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with even smooth carbonation really velvet like in texture on the palate didn't weight me down in any way.

I think this smells more like a Russian Imperial stout than a porter, but that doesn't bother me at all. The taste is heavy on roasted grain and bitter chocolate. Secondary in the flavor profile are tastes of coffee, toffee, and dark fruits. This is a damn well crafted beer. The mouthfeel is so very smooth and full bodied with the alcohol very well hidden.

Theres a moderate about of carbonation to tingle the tongue as well. Initially the flavor is that of dark chocolate. The alcohol provides a warming sensation on the way down.

Mouthfeel is a bit rough, and drinkability is okay, both affected by my perception of the booziness being over-the-top.

There is a nice ring of tan head that is maintained by a nice stream of very fine bubbles. Clarity appears to be very good, but it is very dark and hard to see through. The aroma on this is sublime: chocolate and raisins abound, with a deeper molasses and even a bit of spicy anise playing in there as well. This one is beyond great smelling. The flavor is even better than expected. It starts with chocolate and light raisin. This makes a strong turn towards coffee and deep roast with chocolate melted in. The finish has a nice undertone of anise and coffee grounds. The sweet, fruity, roast notes all come together to make a fantastic beer. The mouthfeel is thick, almost a bit creamy as well, with a rather small to absent carbonation. Overall, I am enamored with this brew. I love how the coffee aspect of this one seems to just come out of nowhere in the flavor and then fall back behind the fruityness, with a crescendo back up on the tail. I also like how the coffee is not present in the aroma, and does a sneak attack in the flavor. There is absolutely no hint of the alcohol in this one anywhere, which makes this extremely dangerous in the long run. I have not had a beer this good in quite a while.","kmpitz2","Aug 25, 2007"

This even "smells" heavy with some very rich notes of thick, creamy chocolate, coffee beans, some dark fruit in the background, and a bit of lactic sourness. Lactic sourness is a bit more noticeable in the taste, along with a bit of booze, but not even close to what one would expect from a 9% brew. Rich, dark roasted grains and semi-sweet chocolate are also very detectable. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Very thick and heavy with a consistency nearly like warm maple syrup. A very, very solid beer.

Powerful licorice dominates the scent with dark fruits joining. Molasses mixes into the nose as well as a tingle of alcohol. Taste is so sweet. Starts with a strong chocolate/caramel malt. Hops find themselves a bit in the middle while it finishes with a nice coffee long lasting flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy with subtle but noticable carbonation. I really like the dinkability of this, I didn't look at the abv until after I drank it. So for 9%, it does an amazing job. I'm still looking for the Wee Heavy!!","BeerTruth","Jul 15, 2007"

Chocolate,caramel, espresso notes in the flavor with just enough of an understated hop presence. A little bit thinner in the mouth than an imperial stout but still smooth and silky. High gravity beers are what this brewery does best and this one is the best of those. A really great beer, one which easily stands along side any of the more famous Eastern European brands.","kwakwhore","Jun 22, 2007"

Quite bready and yeasty. Dark, bitter chocolate flavors. Great body-very full but still quaffable. This is one of the few beers I find I am gulping it is so enjoyable-and trust me it slides right down. Great, great beer all around-very drinkable.

Aroma of coffee and roasted malt is dominant and enjoyable. Taste is dominated by dry coffee notes as well as some light bitter roasted malt. I was expecting more chocolate notes then I could detect and the beer was a bit more dry then expected. Body was quite full with some medium carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. Overall, while this was a very good beer I thought it was slightly too dry for the style and I cant figure out why this rated so high but again I am probably not the biggest fan of the style to begin with.","Phyl21ca","Apr 23, 2007"

The nose is of slightly roasted malts, plenty of toffee, chocolate, and caramel. The taste is of roasted malts, toffee, chocolate, slight vanilla, and caramel. There is a slight bitterness to this brew, with a nice slightly dry finish. Medium body, ABV is hidden pretty well.

3.8,-6.9,4,4,4,4,3,"This is an interesting beer, I don't know if I would want this on a regular basis, but it has certainly shown a mix / balance of flavors that are not usual for the darker American brews; it is almost something that I would characterize as a fresh English Imperial Stout. Too bad this is not bottle conditioned, it might have been quite interesting in 20 years. There is something about this beer that does not allow me to shake the idea that I am drinking burnt prune juice (of course an exaggeration, but still). In the end this is very interesting, even a bit education, definitely good, but still not quite something I would want a big bottle of (certainly the 12oz format is more than enough, even almost too much).","Gueuzedude","Beers"

Served at cellar temperature in a 17-ounce snifter, Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter pours as gorgeously as any of the best big stouts I've tried, all glisteningly pitch-colored with a huge, creamy mocha-froth head. Vinous dark berry and boozy raisin aromas. Many dark fruits appear in the flavor, with Bing cherry, prune juice, mashed currants, and blackberry being the most prominent among them. Overall, a largely vinous taste experience with a pleasant burnt-toast finish that lasts quite a long time as it rides out a noticeable alcohol sharpness in the aftertaste. Smooth-slick mouthfeel, with 9% abv readily apparent. This one seems spot-on for the style, and to top it off, it drinks like a dream. Highly recommended.","orfeu","Jan 08, 2007"

4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pleasantly surprised by this one, I found the fruitiness to be almost irresistable; and the beer itself to be quite unique as Baltic porters are generally lagers, and fruitiness is limited. As expected, it poured an imperviable black body and frothy tan head. The retention was somewhat limited, but at 9% that's to be expected. Some nice rings of lace made up for that. The nose is rich and full, and you could easily while away a half hour or so just nosing it. Apart from the bright, juicy plum, it's also got notes of cherry and dark red berries. Beneath that a darkly toffeeish, coffee-accented maltiness rounds it out. Full-medium in body. Creamy smooth. Similar in flavor to the aroma, the fruitiness sings a siren-song that keeps you coming back sip after sip. A hint of chocolate appears, more low-key roastiness, caramel, and a spritz of alcohol; but based on my experience, a touch of alcohol is appropriate for the style. It doesn't appear particularly bitter, but it's there nonetheless, keeping watch and ready to dry the finish. Surprisingly, after such a massive flavor assault, it fades from the palate rather quickly... leaving you with no choice but to go back for another sip! I am most impressed!","NeroFiddled","Dec 12, 2006"
