3.79,3.6,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a cloudy, but semi translucent dark red brown. Half finger light tan head fizzed intensely and immediately disappeared leaving a tiny ring around the glass. Unusual carbonation behavior. Aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, vanilla and an unusual earthy fruit component. Flavor follows aroma, dark toasted malt, chocolate, vanilla with a hint of coffee. Odd fruit flavor in the finish like an herbal infusion of sour cherry. Light hops in the finish. Light to medium bodied. An unusual porter, with less opacity and body than most Baltic porters, but the toastiness and cherry flavors are good for a Baltic porter. The earthy fruit flavor in the finish does not fit as well. An interesting take on the style that I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste, but somewhat off balanced.","LiquidAmber","Sep 26, 2012"

But the taste was sweet like brown sugar with coffee and a little chocolate. Almost too sweet though on my second sip. It was on the third taste that the overwhelming amount of flavors really danced with steel toed boots over my tongue. Flavors flashed by so quickly I was unable to identify all of them. I've had the experience once before when drinking Duvel, where flavors go by in quick succession. After that it was back to a return to an almost overly sweet. A twelve oz. bottle would have been good enough for me, but it was interesting for the taste bombardment I received. I find it hard to believe that the only listed ingredients were malts, hops and water.","anglagard1","Jun 13, 2011"

3.97,8.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"So, I have come to expect a heavy, syrupy brew when I see a Poland-brewed strong beer. This was no exception. The beer is a rich, black-ish colored liquid (with a reddish hue when held to the light). It has a very interesting aroma. Lots of specialty malts and sugary malt-extract-like smells. It's like a malted shake mixed with lots of chocolate malt and a touch of black patent. The beer seems not to have been fully fermented and then the yeast activity was artificially halted. Very, very sweet and thick. Still, it gives the beer an interesting and nourishing character. It really feels full and satisfying. The sweetness is also not overdone...it is balanced quite well with the rich roasted malts. No real hop presence (maybe a bittering note, but that's all). The heaviness, though, can be a little too much. It is fantastic in the first taste, but wears a little thin after several sips, which hurts the drinkability. I did like this beer, however...very interesting and engaging.","Suds","Sep 12, 2010"
