Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, molasses, raisin, prune, nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of dark malt notes with moderate fruitiness; and good strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, raisin, prune, light roast, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, dark fruit, nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Baltic porter. All around nice balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 02, 2013"

This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and even though the flavors weren't true to style they still held my attention, but I think one would be enough for me, I don't feel the need to crack open another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was actually nice, it just wasn't true to style and it lacked the roasted aromas that I was looking for. What I liked the least about this beer was that it tasted much more like a wee heavy than a Baltic Porter, where did all the roasted malts go? I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have a Thirsty Trout Porter from Dark Horse, it's a little cheaper and it's much truer to style and tastier, I wouldn't recommend this as a good Baltic Porter. All in all i was let down with this beer, it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't what I expect from the style and it was really missing the roasted malts as a key component of this beer. So far I haven't been impressed with any of this beers from the Big Eddy series and this one is no different, I'm starting to lose hope with the series, but I hope the DIPA is better than the rest, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Mar 06, 2013"

It smells of molasses, raisins, and other dark fruits (figs/dates). Tastes like you are drinking a Fig Newton, with well hidden booze.

Nice mix of coffee, port and dark fruits, lingering finish. The carbonation is medium, no detectable booze, dangerously drinkable. I really enjoyed this, good flavor and great drinkability.","bonkers","Jan 01, 2013"

Pretty cheap (I think, I paid around $2 for the single) and definitely worth a try if you are a porter purist.","NoLeafClover44","Oct 08, 2012"

It sure doesn't smell like a Baltic. The flavors too, light for a Baltic with too much of a cola flavoring and no roast. It has some scotch ale attributes to it, also odd. It is also too light in body for the style. Overall this is a pretty bad representation of the style. It really is more like a Wee Heavy than a Baltic Porter. It just needs to be bigger and have more to it.","aasher","Sep 29, 2012"

Despite being a clean lager (which makes it dangerously drinkable for the alcohol percent) it's got ale depth and character. Don't pass this one up.","BeerFMAndy","Sep 10, 2012"
