Bourbon notes are quite forward and boozy, but they really do compliment the underlying flavors rather than overpower. Lots of layers of complexity to the flavor profile, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, sugar, nuts, earthy qualities. Excellent beer to sip and enjoy.","OrangeMen","Dec 27, 2014"

3.84,-11.5,,,,,,"Bottle as a ridiculous extra in trade. Big thanks! Pours dark brown from the bottle and settles essentially black and opaque in the glass with a small khaki brown head. Aroma is definite whiskey, caramel, vanilla, oak, some marshmallow. Flavor starts with dark fruits, chocolate covered raisins, whiskey, charred oak, long finish of char and vanilla. Pretty smooth but seemingly not a lot of rich flavor coming from the malts. Body is silky smooth, medium plus but perhaps not quite enough to handle the barrel, with low plus carbonation. Solid beer, but not sure I get all the hype I’ve heard about this and it’s variants. Certainly a good beer, but the bar is pretty high for BA stuff these days.","BMMillsy","Oct 01, 2014"

4.65,7.1,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,"O- Along with Shmaltz Brewing Co.'s Coney Island Barrel-Aged Blockhead (an Imperial Bock aged in Bourbon Barrels), this is one of the few barrel-aged lagers I am aware of (another being 'Baby Maker,' also from Jack's Abby). This is a massive beer that once again proves that Lager yeast can rightfully due the job of Ale yeast, producing a bombastic Baltic Porter (or better yet because of its roastiness, Russian Imperial Stout) aged in Bourbon Barrels creating a particularly satisfying result. The barrel-aging is significant and only enhances an already well made beer...think again BCBS and KBS! (4.75)","threeviews","Jul 17, 2014"

The beer sticks to the side of the glass, a common feature I've noticed in many bourbon barrel aged beers. Great aroma, dominated by bourbon, with notes of vanilla, dark chocolate, and brown sugar. The taste follows suit. Full-bodied, yet surprisingly drinkable despite how boozy it is. The bourbon is up front and on your face, which is ok with me but should be noted regardless.  I did get tired of this beer towards the end. Very smooth but really hurts from the lack of carbonation. Add those fizzy bubbles in and this is a winner. Without them, it's still tasty, but just falls a little flat.","Jacobob10","Apr 13, 2014"

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"i love jack abby, and its beers like this that make them one of the most unique breweries in the country. taking lager to new heights, this is special, and in some ways i like it better than the vanilla edition. it still has a ton of vanilla to it, just naturally and from the barrel, there really is not much need for additional vanilla. matte black brown in color, thick, but still holding on to a pretty solid off white head, almost grey really. the nose is rich in vanilla notes and dark barley, with earthy mineral density, but very little of the bitterness we normally associate with dark brews like this. the oak from the barrel is there, and the sweetness of the bourbon penetrates the beer a bit too. bakers chocolate and lager yeast are there too, but much more in flavor than smell. vanilla and chocolate up front, but the only real sugar in this appears to be from the bourbon. musty woodiness is picked up on by the lager yeast in the finish, giving this beer a very unique character that is both rich and complex, yet also sort of light and drinkable, certainly for what it is. lots of body through, and a longer finish than i remember on most lagers, but still rather clean for its size. the flavors here are just perfectly proportioned, not too much of anything, still grain first, but peppered in are all kinds of little twists, making this a bottle to be shared and considered carefully. very very well done, i am very keen to try the other incarnations of this now. this has to be the best american made baltic porter out there. if it isnt, enlighten me, but i would be surprised!","StonedTrippin","Mar 04, 2014"

4.19,-3.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Again, looks like Framinghammer - very dark with ruby highlights, tan/brown cap with lacing and good head retention. Slight booze and wood on top of the base beer, chocolate and malt for the most part, cocoa and roast. Nice flavour -- sweetness blends with the mild boozy alcohol and bitterness, chocolate and malt sit just underneath, a bit nutty, woody tannins follow through in the finish. Mild astringency, full bodied, moderate carbonation, not as creamy as the other Framinghammers I've had, but still quite smooth. Quite enjoyable and very drinkable for a barrel aged beer.

This beer looks good, dark brown with mahogany edges, tan had that recedes after a minute or so, solid legs as one would expect from a 10% beer. Aroma of black malt, anise, toffee, and pit fruit. Taste has bourbon out front with a solid anise and a bit of blackberry. Rich mouthfeel with a sweetness that is not cloying and little to no bitterness. Very good beer, but a bit pricy at $8. Would like to see this some day in 4 packs.","unclejazz","Feb 28, 2014"

The oats and brown sugar are what make this feel more like a light stout than a Baltic Porter. Creamy, rich, and smooth! Paired with bourbon barrel aged maple syrup drizzled bacon. Fantastic food/beer combo.","MarcWP","Feb 27, 2014"

Head eventually dissipates into an oily swirl. Some lacing is present but exhibits poor retention. Nose expresses dark fruits, ethanol, vanilla and a suggestion of the barrel. Taste is amazing! Rich cocoa, vanilla and buttery elements nicely co-mingle with the dark fruit and wood revealed in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation and a texture that falls just shy of creamy. This beer is nothing short of spectacular and is only surpassed by the draft offering. Jack's Abby is killing it with pretty much everything they put out. Prosit!","Jwale73","Feb 22, 2014"

I smell brown sugar and chocolate, vanilla, with some hops present as well. Taste is sweet with a slight bitterness at the end which balances it out nicely. Bittersweet chocolate, some bourbon is noticeable but doesn’t take over the entire beer. It has a nice chewy quality to it, smooth and creamy on the palate. Overall this is a very well crafted beer – not hugely complex, but it is very well balanced. Very drinkable for its 10% abv.","greenmtn1111","Aug 02, 2013"

Complex and well nuanced – potent but not overpowering bourbon addition…no problem identifying this as a BA beer, but unlike so many, the barrel only complements the base and doesn’t steal the show. Bourbon gives a bit more bite and calms the sweet aspects of the beer while the vanilla’y oak character really smoothes this out and adds to its drinkability.","portia99","Jun 25, 2013"

The bourbon doesn't dominate the beer, but it is definitely there, especially in the nose as it warms up. More than the other two, this one improves greatly as it warms up, and has a lot more milk and sweet chocolate to it. Overall I have this very close to the coffee version in terms of how much I liked it, giving coffee the slight edge, and with both behind the vanilla version. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the three, and think people's favorite will just depend on whether they like vanilla, coffee, or chocolate the best. Would love to have it again.","mdfb79","Jun 03, 2013"

4.27,-1.6,4.25,4,4.25,5,4.25,"The beer pours an inky black with a nice had of medium sized, khaki bubbles that settle down at about a half a finger’s width, which is surprising given the beer’s 10% ABV and the fact that it was barrel aged. In body, this beer is impenetrable to the eye, and the beer’s head leaves a curtain of lacing full of slippery, small bubbles on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of roasted black coffee and big boozy malt with touches of vanilla bourbon and slight hint of bitter hops and oak. The bourbon isn’t huge in the nose, but it is nice and blends well with the malt of the beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy-bourbon sweet with just a touch of bitter roast and some slight acidic bites. In flavor, this beer speaks of booze, bourbon, and roasted malts. The flavor begins as sweet roasted malt with a touch of chocolate and honey, but this builds into practically cloying boozy bourbon with hints of vanilla and coconut, and a very strong touch of alcohol. The finish is bourbon sweet and full of boozy heat as it runs down the throat, and the aftertaste is slightly sticky sweet with lingering bourbon, coffee and chocolate, but also with alcohol hot in the deep back of the throat. In the mouth, the beer feels smooth and velvety with just a faint bite from the carbonation. It is on the light side of heavy in body and definitely carries a clean lager feel in the mouth. Where a stout of this size would have considerable grip and a chewiness, this beer is silky smooth, almost like a fine hot chocolate in feel. The mouth is, however, left sticky and wet with a lingering heat burn from the alcohol. This beer is most certainly a sipper, in case anyone was overlooking its 10% ABV. Overall, this is a good beer. It’s really a nice sipper, and is probably prime to drink in the early winter when you are looking for a bit of a warmth from your drink. Having just had 2012’s BCBS the other day, I can actually say that there is a similarity between the two, though not definitive. Framinghammer is definitely of lager stock with a beautiful and smooth mouthfeel that helps the drinkability of this beer, and it is also about 5% less in alcohol than BCBS, but it carries a nice bourbon heat and some nice bourbon flavors mixed in with thick malty flavors similar to BCBS. Personally, I would advise sitting on a bottle of this a little bit to let the booze settle down and so that it is winter, but that would probably kill some of the bourbon flavors. Right now I’m not craving the boozy beers, but I would certainly revisit this beer come late fall/early winter and I would certainly sip it in front of a fire. It is a good beer, and fantastically cheap for a bourbon barrel-aged beer. Jack’s Abby has got another great thing here, and I can’t wait to try the coffee version of this beer.","Maxwell","May 18, 2013"

The smell of the beer gives off a good amount of barrel aged aromas. There is a subtle wooden vanilla aroma along with some roasted malt and chocolate on the nose. The taste is slightly spicy, it's males sense knowing they used Jim Beam barrels. The vanilla notes and roasted malts wok well together.

Head stays strong as it slowly recedes down the sides of the glass. First sip and there is the bourbon, not overpowering but definitely asserting itself. Wow nice flavors as the beer coats your tongue with dark porter flavors the bourbon comes in at the back of your tongue. Mouthfeel is a good silky coating of the tongue.

I have become somewhat of a fan-boy, and really enjoyed the original Framinghammer, but this bourbon barrel aging just takes it to another level. I mean seriously, this beer can hold it’s own any day with the best bourbon stouts or porters out there. I’d go as far as to say this is actually BETTER than Founders KBS or Goose Islands Bourbon Stout. Wow. The bourbon aging was like the missing ingredient to perfect this beer.
