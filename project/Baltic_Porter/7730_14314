Very dark brown, almost black pour with a one and a half finger caramel colored head with decent retention and great lacing. Earthy roastiness in the nose with a subtle sweetness along with hints of dark chocolate, coffee, and a touch of vanilla. The taste follows suit with lots of sweet roasty malt and coffee/espresso up front, followed by hints of dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, and just a touch of figs and licorice. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with very little carbonation and a real nice balance between the sweet malts and bitter hops. Overall this is a very rich and drinkable Porter. An excellent example of the style and yet another winner from Nøgne Ø.","beerdrifter","Jan 29, 2013"

Smell is tons of roasted malts follwed by lots of dark chocolate, well hopped, coffee and light liquorice as well, more bittersweet chocolate and a hint of smoke/char. Taste is initially big and roasty, lots of malt with some milk and dark chocolate, medium hop bitterness, black liquorice with a roasty-coffee finish. Medium carbonation, prickly, medium body. Really solid porter, the only way this would be better is if it had a more robust feel to match the big robust flavours, something I would gladly revisit.","peensteen","Jan 12, 2013"

At 7% I'm more inclined to consider this a lighter 'imperial porter' than a true English porter, but I'm not about to split hairs over it - the point to take home here is that this is a balanced, fairly complex dark ale with a delicious bittersweet flavour profile that I absolutely loved. A fabulous brew that is well worth sampling, and a great way to strike Norway from my aptly-named 'countries to sample beer from' list.","thehyperduck","Dec 27, 2012"

Smell and taste are dark chocolate, black coffee, barley, espresso beans, rich roasted malts, a hint of smoke, dried fruits, some sweetness, port wine, and a bold hop bitterness. As the beer warms the fruit and port flavours give off a slight tartness towards the end. Mouthfeel is fuller than medium, creamy and oily middle, prickly carbonation, spicy and astringently bitter finish with a chalky, cocoa powder aftertaste. Exactly what I want from a porter. In terms of drinkability, this beer is much thicker and more robust than others in the style, as it took me nearly an hour to finish the bottle. So it's not as quaffable as I thought it would be. But that's a minor quip - this is still a marvellously complex and warming ale that I plan to sip on frequently as the cooler fall and winter months approach.","cratez","Oct 14, 2010"

It's as though a thicker version of a baltic porter was roasted a bit more than normal. The taste is identical, though, just to be different (those crazy Norwegian liquids!), a firm touch of bitterness is added. It's interesting, I'll give 'em that. The body is a hefty medium, with light carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall, a solid porter, but a bit of a let-down.

Dark, bitter chocolate combines with bready malt, light caramel and mild English yeast. Relatively big bitter citric hops push through, despite the relatively low IBU count and at least four or five months of age on the bottle. There's a licorice flavor in there, too - no idea what that's from. Dry flavor. The beer looks great. It's black with a big head, creamy and light brown.

Metallic quality subsides as the carbonation breaks down. I also get a little bit of creaminess as well, maybe some lactose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation level.

There is a decent malt presence. Very little hops presenting itself openly. The mouthfeel is decent. Really the only part of the flavor that is speaking to me is the rawness of the grain flavor. It is not a bad thing, but I just don't really know what to think about a porter that lacks the characteristics I am accustomed to. There is a nice sweetness about the finish.

The opaque dark brown beer holds a fantastic head and laces very well as the beer fades. Deep French Roast coffee flavor is mixed with light campfire-like notes and really make the beer taste like Stouts, even down to the dry and ashy texture. Hop aromas give a nice fresh pine aroma, taste, while supplying a firm bitterness without the thread of any rising sweetness. Quite dry and clean throughout.

Toffee, ice cream scents follow that along with dates, plums, cooked oatmeal, overall more slow roasted than toasty or smoky. In the mouth it has a great deal of density yet still comes across as medium-bodied, the carbonation vibrates through the liquid to prevent full congealing. The dark bittersweet chocolate here matched more evenly by espresso bean, toffee and general maltiness. There's a nice mineral or spring water freshness below which evokes something like lemon peel or forest pine.

The beer is extremely creamy, very smooth, and a nice after dinner accompaniment. The beer has at least five different malts that add layers of complexity to the taste, and just enough hop presence to make the beer come to life in the finish.

You can almost taste it before it gets into your mouth. A mellow tingle of carbonation, the mouth feel is medium bodied.

It smells fruity with great chocolate tones in the background. The head was great, but then fell fast leaving behind a lilypad effect with a good thick lacing. The color is black with seemingly less than a millimeter of light that comes through in a purple-ish color. The smell is slightly roasty with good chocolate flavors backed up by good dark fruit. The taste is very fruity and has a burst of light fruity flavor that mellows and then has an aftertaste like a great coffee with a nose of the same. Smooth, roasty coffee flavors you find in an expensive coffee. Light mouthfeel that is very smooth, especially for such a large carbonation reaction when opened.

When uncapped, the beer formed a rapidly rising head in the bottle, but the quickness of my hands avoided any spillage. In my imperial pint glass, this formed a four finger tall beige head, which looked in stark contrast to the deep black color of the body. The hefty roastiness of the aroma indicated that this was going to be forceful porter, the kind of drink the vikings would have enjoyed before going on a berserk raid in an alternate brewing universe. Coffee and chocolate were everywhere in the nose. The taste was sharp yet soft as the astringent taste and silky body rubbed shoulders in the same glass. I did not get much of the dried fruit flavors that were mentioned on the back label, but coffee and toffee were definitely abundant. Slight sourness in the aftertaste, and a hint of bitter cocoa lingered on. Some brashness in the mouthfeel from the roast grain, but it was right at home in the style. Well done imported porter, which is not the typical case.","rajendra82","Jun 14, 2007"

4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I purchased a bottle of this somewhat randomly without any prior knowledge of the brewery or the brew itself. Having no real expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this beer. It poured jet black, as you'd expect from a porter of this strength, with a fairly minimal crown of beige foam on top. The head doesn't last long, and eventually settles into a small ring around the edges. I found the somewhat subdued carbonation ideal for the style - it lends an easy drinkability and smooth mouthfeel. The nose and flavor are malt-heavy, roasted and chocolatey, mild but delicious. The taste surprised me somewhat - at 7% ABV I was expecting a heavy porter, something closer to a strong stout. Despite its strength the beer stays true to the modern porter style with a pleasantly mellow character medium-to-thin body. Overall one of the better porters I've had - it's a shame this isn't more widely available.","largadeer","May 20, 2007"

3.58,-11.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A good porter but hard to really set it apart from a large swath of porters out there. If it were my local I'd certainly buy it frequently, but I have no plans on relocating to Norway...yet.","malcontent","May 13, 2007"
4.15,2.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark black body with a nice mahogany color around the edges. Very little head to speak of, but what was there dissipates very quickly down to nothing with no lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly toasted chocolate with a whiff of alcohol in the end. This medium to thin body porter is well carbonated and roll around the tongue perfectly. This porter tastes of bitter roasted coffee, kinda charcoal and smokey too. It finishes with chalky dry chocolate and leaves a slight roasted bitter flavor on the tongue. Very good porter that's very drinkable, and for $5 it's not a bad buy either at 7%. Great beer...","irishmoss","May 11, 2007"
3.9,-3.7,4,4,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, which is my only real complaint about this beer, and there's a bit of warming in the back of the throat. The drinkabiliity is very good as well.","RedHaze","May 08, 2007"
3.51,-13.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a three-finger brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black as midnight. Slight hoppy nose. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is roasted/bitter coffee with a slight smoky finish. $6.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.","jdhilt","May 02, 2007"
3.38,-16.5,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"A very dark black beer with only the vaguest hints of mahogony color when held up to the light. Has a very creamy dark beige head and a little bit of lace. The aroma has hint of spice and licorice with a roast malt backbone. There was a good Porter mouth feel. Oddly all of the flavor seems to land on the back of the tongue and throat. All of the roast malt notes fighting with the bitter sweet chocolate character and a hint of spicy hops.","ybnorml","May 01, 2007"
3.8,-6.2,4,4,4,3,3.5,"The taste is sweet, yet still the body is fairly light. It has a medium heft to it as it rests on the palate; it does not have the heft or rich feeling that I might have been expecting from the aroma. Dusty chocolate flavors are noticeable up front and the finish has a distinct espresso character of burnt acidity, and a suite of roast coffee bean flavors. The beer dries out considerably after the first few sips and it is not quite as rich as I was hoping. Still this is a fairly tasty tipple; one which I am quite content to finish.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

4.05,0,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The second to last Nogne we sampled the other night. This one was poured into a Duvel tulip glass. The body was a deep black hole with a small tan head that lingered for a bit. The been gave off a malty, slightly bitter bouquet that was music to my nose. The taste was a nice solid porter. Roasted malt, coffee, cocoa all mixing together to made a full bodied brew that is worth another try.","ggaughan","Apr 20, 2007"

3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"High in carbonation for a porter but I like it; adds a nice creamy quality to the mouthfeel. Roasty burnt caramel flavors with a pot of stale coffee on the end. Finish is lingering and dry. Again very roasty. Not overly complex but very balanced and palatable.","mcallister","Apr 14, 2007"
4.55,12.3,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Very nice color-deep black but with some subdued ruby highlights. Killer aroma-bittersweet chocolate with an overall malty profile. Very nice bready/yeasty quality to it as well. Extemely bold chocolate flavor. Some great black currant and burnt raisen flavors. Malty sweetness behind it all with just a trace of bitterness. The most chocolate flavor I have ever tasted in a beer that doesnt claim to be a chocolate beer. Great body-the sweetness is very prominant though it has an evenly dry finish. Just a super beer. I wish more US porters had the overall balls that this does. Along the borderlines of a stout to me. Great beer. Bring on the imperial stout I say. I am very, very impressed.","lackenhauser","Apr 10, 2007"

4.05,0,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Into a pint glass, pours a dark black brown, dark tan head of about half a finger, sticks around a bit before receding to a thin film, lacing is kind of thick in falling sheets that don't stick. Aroma is of dark, bittersweet chocolates, some ground coffee, not all too complex, but satisfying. The taste is similar to aroma, bittersweet chocolates and more coffee, a good bittering, pretty sound porter feel to it. The mouth is probably the best parth though, incredible smoothness, medium body feels right, and all in all this is a pretty solid beer.","objectivemonkey","Mar 24, 2007"
4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Very dark with deep ruby highlights. The short cap of light brown foam produced plenty of streaky lacing even after falling to a thin skim of bubbles. Nice aroma, some roast, coffee, dark chocolate and toffee, with just a hint of burnt malt and smoke. Mild, yet solid, bitterness with leafy hops running straight through the middle. Malt sweetness was mostly the chocolate variety with a little caramel filling out the end. Dark malts were more prominent in the finish, just a little burnt and roast charaacter. Lowish carbonation with a medium/full body, fine texture and just a little dry. Tasty stuff! It goes down easy and is nicely balanced. I'd definitely pick this up again.","DrJay","Mar 23, 2007"
4.6,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I expected good things from this beer, but I had no idea it was going to be this good. I should have gotten a case when I had the opportunity. Nogne Porter is an outstanding offering that I urge anyone and everyone to try. Tasting is believing. It's one of the best American porters that I've ever had... and it's brewed in Norway. What are the odds?","BuckeyeNation","Mar 20, 2007"
4.17,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a tight 1/4" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head quickly is down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with slow-falling orange-tinged brown lace. Aroma is rich chocolate, dark fuirt, and some alcohol. Taste mirrors the nose almost exactly, with the aftertaste an amalgam of all of the above, and also a bit of roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and deceptively thin, and drinkability is pretty good. The bottle doesn't say so, but if any beer is an imperial porter, this is it.","ppoitras","Mar 06, 2007"

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a big slightly off-white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of chocolate malt is quite interesting and well balance by some roastiness. Taste is a well balance mix between some chocolate malt with some roasted malt providing some bitterness. Texture is really creamy and this is appreciated considering the style.","Phyl21ca","Feb 11, 2007"
4.03,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Appears an opaque dark brown, almost black, with two fingers of dark tan colored head. No lacing to speak of. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, caramel and cocoa. Tastes of black licorice, and bitter chocolate. The bitterness remains throughout the finish along with a mild sourness. Medium in both body and carbonation. A very nice porter, but I would probably pass it by next time due to the cost. Give it a shot if you have not yet done so.","ClockworkOrange","Jan 30, 2007"

4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Rich and complex, but keeping aplpropriately in porter style. Very delicious with dangerously hidden alcohol. If I didn't know that this was an import from Norway, I would have thought that this was a domestic brew, as it is so fresh. In the style of an American Porter with a nod from English-style. If you like good porters, let this one warm up a bit and you're in for a treat!","jwc215","Sep 03, 2005"
4.03,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Very nice roasted malt and chocolate aroma but has a bit of a nose tingling sharpness to the aroma that I cant pin down. Dark brown to black body with a slowly diminshing thumb thick mocha head. Fore is slightly smokey and segues into stale coffee and chocolate. Nice roasty bitterness in the middle and finish. Doesnt quite have enough freshness to the chocolate malt asspect to it, but still a pretty spot on Porter. Some mild nuttiness in the far aftertaste reminds me of a brown ale.","Jredner","Nov 20, 2003"
4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Intense yet smooth roast flavour with some coffee, black colour. Some quality bittersweet dark chocolate. Also malt and licorice. Good porter, not complex yet satisfying pint, well carbonated, fresh from Norway thanks to trade with Madsberg. Medium mouthfeel.","Sammy","Beers"
4.53,11.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle condtioned. Pours with an excellent thick & tan head. Pitch black, even when held to the light. In a blind test I'd probably say this was a dry stout (not Guinness!), maybe even an imperial. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, cigar box, English pipe tobacco and dark bitter chocolate. Flavour is again roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate. Not too sweet, excellent bitterness where you can sense the hops as well as the roasted malts.","Sigmund","0"
