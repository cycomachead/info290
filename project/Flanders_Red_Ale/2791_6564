The appearance of this beer is interesting with a faintly cloudy reddish brown color. The aroma is less intense than expected with some cherry and fig present. The taste has similar notes with tart cherry and cola, tea and golden raisin present and typical sour fruits aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average/thin. Overall a decent offering and I enjoyed it....not Rodenbach but every style has its sublime examples.","runbirddrinkbeer","Sep 15, 2013"

4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The aroma is reminiscent of sour cherries, or gourmet/fancy maraschino cherries, with a flavor to match. I think of sweet vermouth and black cherries, like 2/3rds of an expertly made Manhattan, with a sweetness matched by a mild tartness. I get some of that vermouth/bitters aroma, a layered, aged sense of different herbs and spices coming together and mellowing out, and the taste of cherries running throughout. Terribly enjoyable and readily accessible.","elNopalero","Jun 12, 2012"

Smell is of malt, sugar, and some very slight sour aromas. Taste is of malt and sugar with no tartness whatsoever. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Very mellow, it seems like I'm going to like it more than I do, somehow. I like it, just not as much as I think I will when I hit the first sip. Mouthfeel is creamy, soft, and sharply carbonated at the same time. Drinkability isn't bad but the aftertaste is a touch metallic and doesn't make me yearn for the next sip. It has a lot of interesting things that it almost pulls off, it just seems the beer doesn't quite walk the talk. All in all a decent brew, one I'd have again.

Some harsh sourness comes in the finish in a lame attempt to balance the beer out. The mouthfeel is sweet and sickly, almost undrinkable in any quantity.
