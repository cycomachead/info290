3.85,11.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Ruby mahogony with thin egg shell head. Nose is sweet, candied dark fruits and sour notes, a bit of wood, vanilla. Taste is soft sour cherries, vanilla, light molasses. Supplication-esque? Very very slightly acidic. Mouthfeel is great, not overcarbonated, keeps smooth to match the vanilla character. Overall, I am very impressed, I haven't a clue how this has such a low score.","SDDanC","Jan 08, 2011"

1.9,-44.8,4,1.5,2,2,1.5,"Poured on-tap in downtown San Diego at the Columbia Street brewpub. The beer was poured into a pint glass, and it poured a dark copper-brown, cloudy coloring. There was a ring of filmy head on the beer. The beer smelled like spilled, dried beer, with overtones of sour malts. The beer tastes are middle of the tongue sour malts all the way. Brutal sour. The sour notes are similar to those of a cider. The sourness actually hits right in the TMJ (joint of the jaw). Not easy to drink. The flavors do not justify the wrecking ball effect the beer has on your mouth and tastebuds.","GarthDanielson","Beers"
