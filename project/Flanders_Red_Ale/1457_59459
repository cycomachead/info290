4.19,7.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Man. If only all of this beer were as good as the fragrance advertises. I mean, it's still a good beer. But the nose on this thing just screams Flemish. The flavor is amazing. Vinegar sour tones are definitely there. I get minute vanilla hints once in a blue moon. The woody tones are interesting as well. And consistent. You know the type I mean (if you've had some experience with the style.) This seems a purists interpretation of the style. Carries all of the characteristics of the style that you would expect to find, but usually wouldn't, even in Belgian productions. A difficult style to pull off. And this one seems to be doing it right. The folks at Arbor Brewing should be proud of this one. Glad I got a chance to try it out.","RblWthACoz","Jun 24, 2012"

4.32,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O - overall, excellent beer, think its better fresh, 2011 is better than 2010 imo, but 2010 is more sour.","decadance","Nov 26, 2011"
3.32,-14.7,3,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"Still, it left a tangy, light, prickly sensation in the finish and aftertaste and was decent enough to buy multiples of. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation; however, this might have potential to re-carbonate in the bottle given the small yeast dose in the bottle base.","FlandersNed","May 27, 2011"

4.22,8.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D- This was a very drinkable beer. While having funk and sourness it wasn't over the top and drinking one bottle would be easy to do. The ABV on this beer was there in the taste but nothing over the top like some of these beers.","alleykatking","Feb 04, 2011"
4.12,5.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to no carbonation. Maybe a bad cork, but the beer is pretty neat and very drinkable. Has some Flanders Red elements and a bit of American wild, pretty cool. Thanks Russ!","Viggo","Nov 15, 2010"
4.07,4.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"drinkability is pretty good. loved the smell. falls a bit flat in the taste, losing a bit of its depth. i think even a little carbonation would do wonders for it. looks like the carbonation is mixed in other reviews, so i'll see if i can find another and re-evaluate.","grub","Nov 01, 2010"
4.5,15.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It is quite interesting how wine like this beer is (definitely red wine too), the nose has a touch more malt focus than the flavor, but even it is really evocative of a fruity, oak aged red wine. My second pour sees me noticing a melding of buttery oak and slightly overly ripe, funky cheese character in the aroma. I really like the lactic acidity that is here, it is not as aggressive as would be found in a traditional Lambic, but it plays a really nice off-setting role in this beer. This is a thoroughly enjoyable beer; it has quite a bit of complexity to it as the red wine character, the oak-barrel notes, the tart / funky fermentation character and the supporting malt character all work together quite well. I feel like I should be more critical of this beer for some reason, but it is so well integrated, so complex and it drinks so well that I can't help but really, really enjoy the experience. This is one that should age very well, I really wish I had a case of this slumbering in the cellar.","Gueuzedude","Oct 25, 2010"
3.77,-3.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D: While I'm no Flemish red fan, this one has a nice nose. The tart sourness continues into the taste but it isn't as vinegary there. A pleasant surprise.","akorsak","Sep 12, 2010"
2.55,-34.4,3.5,3.5,2,3,2,"Drinkability:I was a little disappointed in this beer, I was hoping for more complex sour flavors.","fear025","Jun 28, 2010"
3.75,-3.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: My main complaint with this beer was that the flavor was not quite as good as the aroma, but such is life. Pretty enjoyable either way.","womencantsail","Jun 22, 2010"
3.8,-2.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- This is a decent Flanders Red overall-but cedrtainly not the best in the world. Its not very sour but is slightly acidic and dry. The only turn-off about this brew really is the slightly metallic presence in the flavor. Above average-decent brew overall.","PittBeerGirl","Jun 21, 2010"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is oak with some tartness and some dark fruit. The flavor is tart cherries, leather, oak, vanilla, chocolate, caramel malt and red wine. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Beers"
3.63,-6.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D-pretty tasty and improves as it warms. notes of metallic phenol in the back when it was first served but faded. balanced, not bad.","cpetrone84","0"
