The sour character and the malt bill balanced each other almost perfectly. This beer is crafted and bottled in a very traditional way, and it is evident in the product. I also appreciate the American farmhouse ruggedness it has, over the more Belgian sophistication of a traditional, top-notch Flemish red from Europe.

Scent is not too inviting. Although this one is supposed to be the most sour from the bunch, it is not the most funky, nor does it hold the most tart aroma from the Logsdon beers. Scent is more spicy, and slightly tart. Unfortunately the aroma reminds me of not-so-great breweries that make an attempt at wild ales. The taste is a step up though. The flavor is much more complex and overall better than the nose. Taste starts off immediately tart with cherries and a great amount of oak. Cherry flavors are more sweet than tart. Still tart, but not sour. Wish this beer was more sour. Drinks a little boozy as well for a 6.5% beer. I've had Cascade, Bruery, and RR sours that have higher ABV that have less booziness. Same goes for any saison I've had from Fantome. Finish is very saison-like, and probably the best part of this beer. Drinkability is okay. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic...but hardly. Very carbonated with a light body. Overall, I was hoping for something better. When I read the label and heard about the bugs being used with the cherries...I had high hopes. This beer is a solid beer...just not worth the price tag. I would much rather spend $20 on a wild ale from Cascade or Bruery.","DovaliHops","Nov 27, 2012"

Lots of funky cherries in the aroma. Tends more toward fruit sweetness than Cerasus. The funk is a bit odd, sort of cheesy. Mild medicinal note. Some tannic woodiness. The taste is a nice tart cherry flavor, but it's a bit washed out and doesn't quite pack the punch that I was hoping to find. It's not super sour, though I wouldn't call it sweet. The finish has more of that tannic oak flavor. Mouthfeel is nice, though I'd prefer it to be a bit creamier and less fizzy. So far, this is my least favorite Logsdon beer, but my expectations have grown so much with each beer that it's probably not a terribly fair scale. Still, I probably won't be picking up any more bottles of this beer. On the other hand, I'd be happy to get a glass at a bar.","popery","Nov 02, 2012"
