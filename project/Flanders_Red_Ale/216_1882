Plums and raisins make their way from the aromas to the flavors. Nice and tart. Seems a 'lighter' version of the Grand Cru, and appropriately so. Definitely more of a regular treat than the granddaddy. Delicious.","Mikus","Mar 26, 2015"

Taste is great, not as sweet as grand cru but very good and clean, nothing to complain about. This beer surprised me, not sure what I was expecting but somehow did not expect it to be this good. Not a great value but I would revisit if I could find it as a decent price. Definitely worth trying, excellent beer, and one I plan to revisit.","JamieDuncan","Feb 22, 2014"

Not bad for a toned down Flanders red, but not something, given the price tag ($10) that I'd revisit any time soon.","magictacosinus","Sep 11, 2013"

The head is thin and dissipates rather quickly, but forms a nice thin ring of lace. There are plenty a fruit aromas coming through, apple, grape, lemon and figs too, but I also pick up a very faint vinegar scent. It’s sour and sweetens up as it hits the corners of your mouth, light bodied and very refreshing. The woody flavors do come out as you swallow, but the very faintly and the sourness does linger.

Really more of a quad, dubbel, or Belgian dark. Pours dark brownish res with a thin fluffy head on top. Aroma of plums and cherry, with verry littke sourness. Flavor follows, with some additional strong malt flavor and a bit of molasses, black cherry and a hint of funk. A very good and flavorful beer but not on style here. Medium to heavy slick mouthfeel, soft and smooth on the palate.","BMMillsy","May 09, 2013"

This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, and the flavors kept me interested, but the high amount of sweetness would prevent from having another, one of these small bottles is the perfect amount. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma it was pretty nice with lots of tart fruit aromas. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, a little more head and lacing would make this beer look pretty good. I would buy this again when in the mood for a nice and tart beer, it's not too expensive, especially for a beer from Belgium, I recommend this to anyone who want something with a little bit of tartness to it. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it had just the right amount of tartness to it, and the cherry aspect was pretty nice. This beer made for a good first impression for this brewery and it has made me want to try more of the style, good job guys, this is a pretty tasty and unique brew.","StoutHunter","Jan 18, 2013"

It fascinates me how allowing a beer to become innoculated by a range of microorganisms and then aging it in wood produces such a complexity of character. The smell is just as you might expect, though the flavour seems thinner and less intricate than the aroma. The body is also somewhat watery and insubstantial. Good, but falls short of greatness (I suspect that the lack of bottle conditioning might have contributed to this). Nonetheless, a classic beer that is well worth trying; grab one if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 26, 2012"

Despite having such a light feel, the flavor is not lacking in the least. Letting it linger on the tongue amplifies the tartness to a point of over-stimulation; this ale lets you know that despite a delicate appearance, it will pack a punch if you let it. I definitely recommend, especially as a starter beer for the evening, or as a dessert beer after a meal.","TheHoppiest","Jul 01, 2012"

Exceptionally delicious beer, and while I appreciate subtlety in a brew with sour character, they don't all need to be special occasion bottles that demand constant attention and reflection. This is an outstanding go to just-felt-like-a-sour beer. What I'm trying to say is that no, this isn't a hall of fame Belgian sour, but yes, it tastes absolutely incredible and is an outstanding value. What it lacks in a depth comparison to the grand cru it makes up for in casualness. Anyway, great medium body on this beer, very pleasant carbonation. All in all, like I was saying, a totally worthwhile beer, but if you came for the funk you might leave disappointed.

The fruit elements are so dominant which says a lot for a beer that doesn't contain fruit. This was probably too much for the meal I paired it with -succotash and scallops with a chili rub, but I enjoyed how the fruit sour elements combined with my wife'c coconut curry basmati rice and firecracker shrimp. I could enjoy this red about any time it doesn't stand up to the high level of drinkability and flavor quotient of the Grand Cru, but hey for what it is Rodenbach is a decent all around beer.","Slatetank","Jul 07, 2011"

Bits of oak and acetic acid in there, really not what I was expecting. Lots of bubbles, medium to thin body, chalky sugary fruity mouthfeel.

Very mellow as far as the sharpness of the tart side is concerned. There is a chance this is almost four years old now so maybe the age has mellowed the whole thing out a bit. Very juicy tasting up front with the dry tartness rounding out the end, but not in a way that overrides the sweetness. This brew ends more balanced than I remember other examples of the style ending. All and all this is simply amazing as far as texture and drinkability go. The mouthfeel is only slightly chalky and is far from thin or heavy or watery. The drinkability is like Powerade when you're really thirsty. (I can drink Powerade pretty damn fast hungover). Super tasty.

The brew starts off tart and dry with lemon, grapefruit and oak flavors. These flavors melt away to a smooth and sweet malt, with some brown sugar and raisin. The transition of flavors is quite unique. The sour plays very nicely with the malt producing a strangely balanced beer.

The flavor is generally tart, in a fairly gentle way, with light sour cherries and oak notes in the background. There is a tiny bit of vinegary in the aroma.

It does indeed smell and taste quite a bit like vinegar. The flavor is dark fruits with some cherry and vinegar. It is a little sour but not as sour as I was expecting. There is a winey presence about it. The finish and aftertaste is a bit weird and bland. Overall it's not horrible and easier drinking than I feared but I don't really like it. The first sip I had was a little gross but it grew a little on me. Still, I would have been perfectly happy with a small 12 ounce sample.

Taste is a bit bland (as I said it is out of date by a year!) but still has a sour apple and mild oak to it. Very metallic aftertaste and virtually no carbonation. Doesn't taste skunked so this may be its true taste. The sour taste isn't too overpowering and yeilds some sweetness on the palate.

In any case, while this isn't quite as good as the Grand Cru, the 'regular' Rodenbach is reasonably close, giving you about 70% of the Grand Cru experience. A because it has a bit lower ABV, the Rodenbach makes it a better session beer. Like the Cru, this is a defining example of the Flemish Red style.","watchnerd","Jan 21, 2008"

Possible hints of oak as well. The taste is incredible. Dominated by tart cherries, some vanilla and minimal vinegar that only helps the balance. Also some ripe apple. The mouthfeel is nice and coating, allowing even the smallest sip to linger.

While I like the aroma, to me it seems to be more one dimensional than I would like. The flavor of course highlights the fruit and sour profile but to me seems to be a little more harsh with a stronger acidic note than I would like to see. Again just like with the Aroma I am not picking up the properties that I would expect from a being aged (part of it) in oak. To me this is a solid brew, like this type of brew but in my book it is not in the same book as Mestreechs Aajit, Monks or Duchesse.

It was almost more like a wine than a beer. Full, delicious, and unique. As far as the making of the beer, I learned that: 75% of each bottle is freshly made, while 25% is front a pervious batch; there are 20 types of yeast in the beer; it is aged 2-3 years in oak barrels.

This appears to be light and crisp with a very wine-like oak aroma. Beyond the sour tones up front you can smell a light sweetness in the background. Sour cherries, raisins, and grapes. The taste is tart up front with a flood of unripened cherries and a slight tweak of malt. It then drops off slightly into a very mild pure carbonated water taste. Very strange flavor profile. Not quite sure what to make of it yet. I'm relatively sure that this isn't my kind of thing. I have tried Duchesse De Bourgogne a while back not knowing that it was a Flanders Red Ale and I remember it having a more full flavor and more continuously rich flavor profile. This one sort of drops off in such an abrupt manor. Not enough alcohol for the oak aging to really do much for IMHO. Overall, I was glad I tried more than one of this style for relativity if nothing else. Quite an interesting style, maybe I'll try the Grand Cru in a couple of weeks to see if the extra alcohol brings something better to the table.","Rudgers73","May 09, 2007"

The apple and grape smells follows in the taste which is fruity with the hint of sour for which this style is named. The sour flavor is present although not overpowering or unpleasant in any way.

This one isn't devoid of character by any means, but it could be so much more. Many other examples of intentionally sour beers are out there, and many are better than this. This is mild enough, in fact, that I'd say it would be a great beer to introduce others to the style, before moving on to sour brews with more "oomph".

The nose is complex and intensely - dare I say it - almost intimdating at first: fairly heavy oak tones with numerous fruits with a fairly heavy dose of a tart quality to it. The flavor itself initially is a subdued oaked-woodiness that is followed by the substantial lactic/sourness and pocedes to multiple layers of oakiness as the flavor itself feels like it spreads outward from the direct center of the tongue. The mouthfeel is full, but it's dangerously drinkable and enjoyable. I am quite surprised that something of this quality if fairly easy to come across here in town; although, don't allow my surprise to be anything to prevent someone from trying this.

A complex aroma of cidery farmhouse yeast , some background peach/apricot fruitiness, and a musty french oak with toasted malt overlapping. Caramel taste briefly sweetens the flavor, followed by a malt vinegar bite. Aftertaste is tart and dry, with a funky belgian yeast flavor, and lingering sourness. No hops to speak of, but this balances fine without. A crisp, medium-high carbonation and medium body accentuate the acidic kick, and produces a very lively mouthfeel.

A good brew worth giving a try, if the opportunity presents. This would go very nicely with a big Thanksgiving meal revolving around Turkey. Find it and enjoy!","BadBadger","Mar 19, 2006"

The smell was tart and a little wild with some lactic overtones. The aroma faded as the glass sat. The taste was tart and lactic with flavors of sour cherries and a hint of sweetness. There was mild maltiness beneath the tartness, and a faint hint of cinnamon or spices. The mouthfeel was tart and fruity with medium body and good carbonation.

Carbonation is fairly high. Not as flavorful, rich or smooth as its big brother but those lesser qaulities make it easier drinking and still a tasty beer.","sabrills70","Mar 18, 2006"

Big-time sweet/sour acidity takes hold of the palate. It's like drinking sour candy. Wow. This tartness, while intense, stays just on the safe side of mouth-puckering.

Some red grapes on the side only help to delineate it's character. Seafood is another choice to consider, as it's acidity clearly cuts through, and mussels in red sauce is a classic. Finally, it also works well at the very start of a meal as an apertif, or with salad (think vinaigrette and soft cheese); and at the end of the meal as a palate cleanser.","NeroFiddled","Feb 21, 2006"

Just has this one tonight. The beer pours a deep redish brown color with a slight tan head with some good lacing. The aroma gives a big kick of cheeries with some earthy notes in the background. The taste is a cluster of cherry tartness with a good balance of carbonation and more of the earthy notes I got in the aroma.

The smell is a musty cellared smell. It has a very clean taste for a Flemish red ale. An initial sour berries flavor peaks in a sour mid-note and fades to an oak sour finish that lasts. It gets better as you sip it and become familiar with it. Not my favorite Flemish Red by far. The flavor isnt near as complex as my favorite beer Duchesse de Bourgogne or its sister Vichtenaar. However, I like this beer far better than Rodenback Gran Cru.","TheEclecticGent","Jan 23, 2006"

It has an intensely tart flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and sour. It has a nice mix of crystal and roasted malts along with some oak notes. I can't get enough of this tart taste; damn it's refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good beer.

Good notes of cherry and acetone sweetness (I always liked the smell of acetone) with a sharp tartness that is so nice. Flavor is very well balanced, with the sweet cherry hitting first followed by a moderate sharp sourness that turns to a light residual sweetness on the finish. Very clean and incredibly tasty. Feel is on the light end of moderate with a full moderate carbonation. Very light and clean, keeping it disappearing from my glass at a high clip. A very tasty and drinkable beer.

I like to try new things and I never drank sour ale before but I did not anticipate how sour, sour could be. To me it tasted like vinegar. I spent half an hour trying to drink the blasted stuff hoping that I would "develope a taste" for it. But that never happened.It tasted like vineagar from the first sip to the last. The bottle cost me $7 (750ml) and I consider it money well spent since I now know that sour ale is NOT for me. There are many good reveiws of this ale, apparently there are those who like sour tasting beer, but it is not for everybody.

It poured with a largely beaded, off-white, and bit inconsistent head. It has a gorgeous pure mahogany color that is incredibly inviting. Wow, the smell is very vinous, almost like a merlot. Among the odors include; sweet malt, cherry, oak, and sour grape. Its surprisingly medium-bodied and very liquid in mouthfeel. I immediately notice that this is a very different and complex beer. The sour character is evident from the first sip. I'm sensing sour cherries/grapes, prickly fruit notes that engage in a serious tug of war with the sharp sour notes that result in a highly acidic character. It finishes more tartly as the sour notes fade, also somewhat dry with a touch of grit. Wonderful oaken fruit notes remain. The complexity is amazing. Even if you're not into the style, its something you have to try once.","Hhawk06","Dec 26, 2005"

Poured deep ruby with a thin head and persistent light carbonation. Aroma was sour cherries, and some other funky aromas that I could not put into words. Taste is delightfully sour and refreshing. Tingly mouth feel is heightend by a mouth puckering sourness and persistent light carbonation. Mouthfeel is light and overall this is a very drinkable brew.","Citadel82","Dec 10, 2005"

The taste is the same with an acidic sourness and fruits (cherry? raspberry?). The body is medium, initially tingly, and fairly drying.

The sourness has a nice finish to it, but overall the flavor just doesn't do much for me. It does not have enough complexity or drinkability to make me really want it again.

And its surprisingly crisp and quenching, driving the drinkability skyward. And yes, I did indulge that asset, what with a DD in tow.

Taste is strong cherry, noticeable lime, a hint of sugar, and a nice tart dry finish. A nice balance of the tart/sweet that really makes the brew refreshing. Mouthfeel is weak. Too light, too craft soda like for me. Very reminiscent of a Stewarts Black Cherry soda. If in the mood, warm day, etc...a very nice beer, but not for all occasions by any means.

3.8,-4.8,4,4,4,4,3,"Upon pouring this beer into my Unibroue Tulip glass, a slightly tan creamy head swelled up about 2 fingers in depth. The head on this beer was absolutely remarkable with a certain frothy texture popping with blue and red micro bubbles. The beer poured a dark brown with a hint of deep burgundy when held up to a lamp. The smell was of pungent sour cherries, vinegar and grass. The initial taste was that of a malty brown ale that immediately transformed into a tart cherry and grape and finished clean with a ginger-like flavor. I sipped from this glass for about an hour and then re-poured from the 750ml bottle with remarkably similar results. This is a fantastic beverage to sip throughout an evening with company. While I am an amateur in the realm of Belgian/Flemish sour ales and lambics, I highly recommend this brew to anyone interested in the style as it has certainly turned me on to exploring other varieties.","qcitydarkstar","Oct 09, 2005"

Not one of my favorite styles of beer, but a good change of pace. Pours a hazy reddish-copperish-dark brown with a small, off-white, tight, creamy-looking head with good retention. Excellent, thick lacing. A bit sweet smelling but with a sour tinge to it as well as expected. Fruity (cherry and grape), bready and woodsy smelling with a hint of vinegar. The sour smell and taste instantly give away its style. Very typical aromas and flavors from the brets. The taste is mostly fruity with a light malt backbone. Kind of reminds me of some apple cider I recently had that I let get a few weeks old to where it has that nice zing to it. The taste seems to be a little one-dimensional, but I havent had too many flanders ales to know if this is typical of the style or not. I mean, the taste was good, but there wasnt all that much of it, nor did it last very long on the finish at all. Medium-light body, moderately astringent, and soft carbonation. An interesting ale, and good but not great, though I blame a lot of that on the style. Not my cup of tea, but probably a little above average compared to other flanders Ive had. I'm glad I tried it.","ski271","Oct 08, 2005"

Aroma is quite the funk, smells of a barnyard backed up by sweet thick figgy malt and a hint of vinegar. Flavor is like figs and sour cherries, the scales sway back and forth between sour and sweet, slightly bitter and peppery spice. Quite a complex flavor profile going on here.

The beer has a deep ruby color with hues of brown, a head of foamy tan lace and a moderate amount of carbonation. The smell didn't really impress me, with a bit of a sour note that felt drowned out by rather flat malt and some residual carmel sweetness. The first sip was surprisingly smooth, without the sharp acidic bite I'm used to from this style. This instead has a sweet brown sugar flavor, mixed with some sour cherry and fruity esteric malt. I really wasn't amazed, and yet I still liked this quite a bit. I think it's worth trying in a bottle just to see if the flavor is more defined. In any case, not a bad offering especially if the sourness of this style is a turn off. A nice, balanced version with plenty of malt and sweetness to smooth the edges.","99bottles","May 23, 2005"

A tad of other spice and is it the oak that brings this all together? A full mouth experience. Sure liked it a lot more than their Grand Cru. Just as good on-tap at Eulogy In May 2005.","Sammy","Aug 31, 2004"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"After drinking the grand cru last night, i tried a regular one today. Colour looks to be less dark but a great autum colour; no great head but a spectacular nose. Litle sour but lots of cherryfruit and overal more then plesant. Taste is full, litle sour, cherry and oak. Great beer however I think it's not what it used to be.","paterlodie","Jun 30, 2004"

3.7,-7.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Bottle drank at le Cirio in Brussels: Poured a light red/brown colored beer with a nice head with better then average retention. Aroma is mostly dominated by the oak/cherry smell but not as strong as for the Grand Cru. Taste is surprisingly more refreshing then expected with again the oak/cherry taste and some light sweetness. The end is a bit sour and watery. This is not on par with the Grand Cru but it would wonderful to drink this during a hot summer days beside the pool.","Phyl21ca","Jun 16, 2004"

4.2,5.3,4,4,4,5,4.5,"The taste off the bat brings those cherries down to bear in an almost lambic fashion. Black cherries take on a sweet and sour lemon, with balsamic edge, which is both mouth-puckering and refreshing. This tiny bottle went far too fast. Hard to locate the hops until well after the cherries have left the building. Notes of mint and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Carbonation comes out as creamy in the forefront, with a medium blast in the throat, all at the same moment. Then returns to being creamy and rolls down the throat. Pleasing.","donnebaby","Apr 07, 2004"
4.35,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drying and inviting, very drinkable. Great complexity and subdued Belgian funkiness. Light notes of sherry, vanilla, ever so slight almonds. A classic Belgian that dissapeared like a perfect spring day.","brewandbbq","Mar 31, 2004"
3.5,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pour is dark caramel, completely opaque with a medium cream dark tan head, lasting for a bit. The smell is fruity as the taste, in terms of rather 'frutti di bosco' sorta fruits (red stuff I guess), very pleasing combination within a very dense body.","Andreji","Mar 18, 2004"
4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very malty and sweet, with cherry, red grape, and a hint of alcohol. The taste is also fairly malty, with sweet fruits and a little spice. The finish has a slight tartness to it. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability is fairly good too. A solid Belgian Red.","SheepNutz","Mar 15, 2004"
3.73,-6.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark red color. The smell is winy and woody. The beer matured two years in wooden barrels, so its not really a surprise. Im kind of scared because I usually dont appreciate this kind of beer very much. Cherries, wood and fruity wine flavors come in the taste. Raspberries and blueberries. Sweetness. Definitely cherries. The mouthfeel is light. The real surprise for me was the sourness, mixed with some slightly bitter aftertaste. I didnt expect the tart but it was very deep in the brew. Good, but not one of my favorites. Too sour for my taste.","tjd25","Beers"
4.35,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Taste is much like the smell. Sour cherry and vanilla in the body followed by musky chocolate, hints of oak. Lightly sour finish. Not nearly as full-flavored or sour as the smell would indicate but nicely balanced. A bit thin with a lingering sourness on the tongue. Very smooth and pretty drinkable for the style. Not nearly as sour when I last had it some 8 years ago but I will chalk that up to a maturing palate. A real treat and a classic.","ViveLaChouffe","0"
3.85,-3.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This one changed my idea of the normal "beer" flavors. Rodenbach packs a very complex flavor different from other sweet fruit beers or Belgian ales, and I'm glad I tried it. While I respect the flavor, it's definitely not something I'd come back to  not really my thing  and the high cost in the U.S. means I'll have to stick with other Belgians I like better.","jed","Dec 19, 2003"
4.15,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"If I wanted a drink this fruity I would have a glass of wine. Gimme something with hops that bite and malt that greets me without and shyness.","Naerhu","Nov 07, 2003"
4.7,17.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pre-palm vintage, perhaps a 1993? This stuff is dark brown with a small off-white head. Aromas are of smoky malts, cherries, acidic funk, chocolate, and more. The taste is chocolate-like, with smoke, cherries, funk, and lambic-like acid all in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner thinner than usual, and the drinkability is still absolutely awesome. Wow this is so different than fresh, post-palm rodenbach. I wonder if the reciple changed? At 10 years old this stuff is starting to have the complexity of a Hardy's!","francisweizen","Nov 02, 2003"
4.35,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottom line: Most BA's present thought the age of the keg detracted from the flavor of the beer. One former brewmaster thought it improved with the age. I thought the aging changed the beer a little but in a neutral manner. Although I prefer the Grand Cru and the Alexander, Rodenbach is a great example of what is right about Belgian beer. Refreshing, unique, and highly drinkable.","skar","Oct 20, 2003"

4.62,15.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was, amazingly enough, a bottle from 1988, served at Kroegske. Appearance: Mild head, bright dark red color, very clear. Aroma: very strong sourness, still enough malt to balance it out, with an incredibly smooth balance. Flavor: Tart and very mellow. Malty is subdued, and vinous flavors. Dinkability is dominated by tart finish. The sourness wonderfully masks the age; the only way you would have any idea how old it is would be that they don't make it this well anymore!","saltydog","Aug 01, 2003"

3.95,-1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A truly lovely beer! It's a shame that I had tasted the Grand Cru before I tried this as it's kind of like a "Grand Cru lite". The oily taste of the "Grand Cru" isn't as noticeable and the mouthfeel is not as big. However the woody/cherry flavour is still there along with that wonderfull tartness. I will be drinking this again...... and again.","ALEBOY","Jun 09, 2003"
3.05,-23.6,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Originally sampled on 19 April 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This beer is a reddish brown color w/ a dirty white head. It has a slightly sour taste, but overall is well balanced. To me, sour ales are a bit of an acquired taste. This one is on the milder side. For this style, it's a middle of the road beer.","jcalabre","May 19, 2002"
4.47,12,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Lovely looking beer - a nice dark brown. Murky. Almost didn't catch the head. Very thin and fleeting. No lacing at all. Smells of sour apples. Tasty. Very clean and very light. Hardly any aftertaste at all. A perfectly neat, clean finish. This beer is turning me on to the sour types!","dwarbi","Mar 27, 2002"
