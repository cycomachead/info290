While flavorful, there is a lightness here that makes it quite enjoyable. It doesn't singe the tastebuds, it arrives and gracefully exits as the swallow indicates. I'm not sure if this is barrel aged or not, but there is a semi-sweet red wine character to this that is really nicely done. Hopefully this is a sign of good things to come for Bluejacket's sour program.","siege06nd","Aug 04, 2014"
