4.56,6.3,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"My palate is pretty intrigued by this Flanders red ale. It has excellent complexity, as well as focused and controlled intensity. Much in the same way there's an art to integrating the alcohol of high strength beers into their flavor seamlessly, I think this ale artfully integrates sourness in a way that keeps it intense yet doesn't overwhelm.","Kuaff","Apr 01, 2015"

It pours brilliant chestnut with cherry highlights and a very dense, persistent, finely bubbled, off white foam cap. It attacks with a light sweetness and then the tartness explodes with unsweetened lemon, plum, a little orange, and dark cherry. The sweet and tart oscilate through your mouth culminating in a sweet and sour finish that lingers in a long fruity aftertaste. The carbonation is above average but it has a very fine bead giving the beer a very light, creamy texture.","pat61","Mar 17, 2015"

Excellent nose of slightly sour tart raspberries (most prevalent) and cherries over a light caramel sweetness with notes of oak.  Almost light medium bodied with a nice smooth texture that has bursts of creaminess in the finish.  Well carbonated with effervescence from the middle on.  The flavor profile is World Class and hits the marks on intensity, complexity and balance.  It begins with a slightly sweet burst of raspberry with cherry undertones.  These flavors effervesce into a nice tartness in the middle with just a touch of sourness underneath.  Coupled with these are notes of oak over a balancing caramel sweetness.  As these progress towards the finish, tartness becomes prevalent and a mildly sour puckering effect sets in.  The somewhat dry finish is a fade of fruit flavor remnants over a lingering mildly tart sourness.","tillmac62","Jan 09, 2015"

It's hard to say if I'd change anything about it. I'd perhaps opt for a darker vanilla head, accompanied by a little more funk and sweetness on the nose. Tastewise perhaps a little more funkiness and weirdness. I'd love to try this beer at 10-12% just to see what the additional viscosity could do for the mouthfeel, although it's already superb. A must try.","abeeronthebeach","Sep 26, 2014"

4.76,11,4.25,5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours a cloudy mahogany red color with a bubbly reddish tan head with decent retention and nice lacing.  The nose…ahhh, the nose is just wonderful! Lots of toasted malt, ripe fruit sweetness, cherries, hints of oak, some subtle acidity, leather and whispers of some tart barniness. The taste is equally complex and yet so drinkable.  Really pronounced red fruit (cherries), but some deeper ripeness in the form of raisins; some toasted malt and caramel, white pepper, leather, oak.  The body is full and round, yet light on the tongue with lots of carbonation, but in no way over-carbed.  Wow, this is just a fantastic complex, subtle yet highly drinkable beer.  Truly delicious!","mtomlins","Sep 19, 2014"
4.32,0.7,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.25,"Overall: definitely the best sour beer I have had to date. Lots of complexity and an fantastic, smooth-yet-sharp mouth feel make this one a must have, even at a price of AU$130+ for 24 x 330mL. Maybe one every now and then as a treat.","SmashPants","Sep 18, 2014"

Not sure what to pair it with- some lighter cheeses, perhaps even blue cheese would go well, sharp cheeses like cheddar, sour fruits like cherries or raspberries, medium to light body with medium to light carbonation. Actually good at room temperature. It’s a VERY aquired taste and needs to be considered when to drink this beer. Black chunky floaties near the bottom.","patre_tim","Jun 23, 2014"

I get young grapes straight away on the nose, followed by apple pulp, a bready character, and a bit of oak from the barrels. This one starts out really sour with a lemon taste, but soon becomes much sweeter with a big red grape presence. There are slight notes of bread and vanilla, but the grape taste dominates. It gets a more puckering again on the finish with a green apple skin tanginess. The whole thing is pretty well carbonated and it's as light, dry, and easy-drinking as champagne.","itsscience","Jun 01, 2014"

So many flavors, combined with a predominantly soft and creamy wood aged texture, as well as delightful fruit and wine-like notes, this is a world class Flanders red. It won't kick the crap out of you, but its profile to be extra flavorful and yet so easy to drink (as well as easily pair with food) should be noted. Want to turn wine-only drinkers on to beer?

Poured a reddish brown body with one finger a head on top of an aroma of a lot sour and funky fruits, mainly a tart cherry aroma, a touch of wood and/or wine-like qualities and a a touch of sweetness. Beer is light bodied and smooth and not as sour/funky as it smells. The sour/tart cherry aspect is aplenty but there is a great balance of sweetness (whether it be candi sugar or fruit derived) and the funk aspect is minimal so it's not a overpowering, puckering sourness or tartness but just hits the right spot. Great carbonation so beer is lively and finishes real crisp. Just a great beer to sip with after dinner.","clayrock81","Feb 18, 2014"

4.1,-4.4,4,4,4.25,4,4,"The king of the Flanders reds perhaps, there could very well be better tasting examples of the style out there but this one is widely available and a relatively recent arrival to Alberta. A russet reddish to brown color with around three inches of tan head comprised of noticeably small bubbles. Aroma is that of red wine vinegar, grape candy, tart cherry juice, red berries, and lemon. Very sour and makes the nose tingle (in a good way). I also get some light earthy malt beneath the sour assault. Taste is dry, sour, woody, fruity, carbolic, and sour. Complex and somehow manages to juggle a bright, intense fruitiness with a strong sourness such that neither component gets trumped or dominated by the other. Tastes like dilute balsamic vinegar, sour pie cherries, lemon, tamarind, raspberry, nectarine, and tea leaf, but there are also some light sultana raisin and brown sugar notes in the background. Pucker-inducing to my palate. The ABV does put in a brief appearance here and there. Body quite thin with a moderate to high degree of carbonation. Reminds me a bit of the chokecherries you could snack on in the Northern Saskatchewan bush if you were so inclined, albeit much, much tastier. I am tempted to introduce this beer to a few wine snobs I know.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 18, 2014"

The smell is sour and tart like sour cherries and rotting pears. There are also elements of yeasty maybe baking bread scents. The taste starts with a punch of tartness and flows into sweet cherry flavors with hints of vanilla and oak in the rich finish. The mouthfeel is on the low end of being medium bodied and very silky and smooth.

Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red grape, balsamic vinegar, oak, red wine, clove, light leather, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of tart fruity ester notes with good barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of tart cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, balsamic vinegar, red wine, light leather, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart dark fruits, oak, hay, balsamic vinegar, red wine, light funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of tart fruity ester flavors with moderate oak presence; with a great malt/acidic balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately slick and acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Flanders Red ale! All around great balance and complexity of fruity/acidic flavors with moderate barrel presence; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

The age makes it smoother than the fresh bottle. The sour component is preceded by a dark brown sugary malt that is quite sweet, and just the right offset for the sour. The long finish makes it easy to sip. I'm not the biggest fan of sour beers, but this is delicious.","mmapes","Jun 14, 2013"

I'm a big fan of sour beers, and I sure do love my American Wild Ales that stretch the palate towards unobtainable levels of tartness, but this beer proves that you can be both sour AND complex, and when done properly, it's a wonderful thing to behold. The fact that it's fairly readily available may be the biggest wonder of them all.","tectactoe","Jun 03, 2013"

So layered and complex, I can hardly believe this is just water, barley, hops, and assorted bugs. There are just so many fruit flavors here, and the added vanilla/barrel character just brings it to that next level. The best part is its widely available and cheap relative to the style. I could drink this every day. If you are a fan of sours and haven't tried this one you need to. If you are wondering about trying a sour beer, this is a great place to start.

The nose belies a red-fruit sweetness, hinting at figs and cherries with a hint of plum, and when you taste, you get what you came for. Sometimes you want that Balsamic vinegar thing, and I feel this beer has enough tartness and sweetness to at least satisfy that desire without being an overpowering note. Very well-blended beer, a delight to drink, without being scary for the unprepared (my first Flanders red was way heavier than this, and might've scared me away from the style... ) all around enjoyable offering from Rodenbach, and one of my new favorites.","BigBarley","Apr 29, 2013"

The smell of the beer is slightly sour, with notes of oak and cherry. The taste is really nice, it's got a subtle tart cherry flavor with a slight sweet malt backbone. The flavors are very well balanced. The mouthfeel is light bodied, with a solid carbonation and very drinkable. Overall this beer is very good. Would drink it again anytime.","Knapp85","Apr 20, 2013"

The beer is light and refreshing with hints of cherries and a medium sourness. The flavor that is left in your mouth as you put your glass down is the part where this beer really shines.

3.98,-7.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a murky brown like melted brown sugar, and there is a nice light cream head on top that circles the glass but leaves the middle clear. The second pour produced a bigger head with some slight tanning to it. The beer is quite dark and very murky, but there are some light carbonation bubbles. There is also a nice dark rose tinge to the color. The beer smells big and sour with strong cherry leather wafting. The alcohol is also a little present at the back of the nose, leaving a slight spicy burn. The beer also smells richly caramelly, but this is over powered by the vinegar sour which stings at the nose, and the cherry leather which plays with the caramel. The beer tastes wonderfully cherry tart with terrific and strong esters coming off the yeast and suggesting green apples and slight pineapple accents. Of course this beer is mostly about the big sour taste, and it delivers beautifully, bringing big sweet fruit notes over the tongue while it puckers the sides of my mouth. The initial rush of flavor is big with sour cherry, but as the beer opens up it really highlights the esters beautifully. The aftertaste is very strong with the apple esters and the remnants of the sweet cherry. As the beer warms the apple esters also become more dominant. The mouthfeel is prickly and effervescent with carbonation, leaving it a little harsh on the tongue, but the beer is soft and chewy, leaving the palate wet with lots of dry patches and wanting more as it puckers with the sour after-shocks. Overall this is another tasty Flanders Red that is quite cheap and easily accessible making it a great introduction to the style. I liked Oude Tart a little more than this I think, as it was thicker and got a little more caramel into the sour, but this is a terrific sipper and is worth a try.","Maxwell","Sep 30, 2012"

It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I have had this one before out of the bottle and I have to say that It carries over quite well on-tap as well. The vinegar touch on this brew is what keeps me coming back to it over and over. This also includes the various Vintage versions that I have had in the past as well. Really enjoyable and definitely brings the pucker along for the ride to keep you on your toes.

Taste is of sweet and sour cherries, vinegar, funk, and a dry woody flavor on the finish. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel but with a drying quality in the mouth with each sip. Overall, this is a very good beer that is better than the classic Rodenbach but not as good as the 2008 Vintage I have tried.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 04, 2012"

The taste is very similar in profile, but a little more complex. The oak comes out more in the taste, along with other berries. Feel is tart, with a mouth puckering effect.

Smell isn't bad necessarily, just lopsidedly sour with nothing else to balance. Taste is like drinking balsamic vinegar straight up. Bottle said it's supposed to have a "sweet-sour" taste and it absolutely did not. It's also so dry in the mouth that a couple sips totally ruin the palate.

4.17,-2.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours deep, dark cherry to brown in color with thinnish tan head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving nice lacing. Aroma is vinous and fruity with apple, raspberry, cherry and grape notes. A touch of nutty or biscuity malts lurks in the background. The flavor brings out some stale malt with plenty more fruit flavors. A tad sweet but not nearly as much as what the aroma hinted at. Definite sour, earthy overtones, with a kick of moldy barnyard funk almost reminiscent of some strong blue cheeses toward the end. Medium bodied, fairly mouth-puckering feel. Nice and refreshing with just enough complexity and funk to make a lively, interesting beer.","goldbot","Nov 10, 2011"

The smell has nice oak and different dark fruits in the mix. Just a touch of the vinegar in the aroma. Very pleasant. Amazing taste. Sweet and sour are blended perfectly. You get the fruitiness up front followed by a slight acetic dose of sourness on the swallow. Very dry finish and the salivation keeps me coming back for another sip. Carbonation is there but that's to be expected. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Not overly sour or harsh like some sours.

Reddish brown, dark cherry soda appearance. Not much head or lacing although the cork popped nicely on the review bottle. Aroma is tantalizingly tart and sweet, with the faintest hint of vinegar in the background. Cherry in there, too. The flavors are the same; the vinegar note, while noticed, is small and muted enough that non sour aficionados can enjoy this one too. Very fruity, mostly cherry but maybe plum/raisin/cranberry as well? Super tart, crisp, clean, refreshing. Excellent carbonation. I had this one at the end of a very very long day of teaching, followed by a memorial service in a sweltering church, then cleaning the house till midnight to prepare for guests.

It was divine intervention, as this bottle was in its absolute prime. This beer is truly a magical blend of flavors. The young beer is vibrant, the old beer is wise, and the barrel is the time in between. After drinking this beer, I felt like I had watched a fine film. My mouth applauds.

4.12,-4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"750ml corked and caged bottle served in a Spiegelau tulip. Best before 09/04/13 printed on the base of the bottle. Pours a brownish-plum hue with a murky clarity and a loose half inch, off-white head that immediately disperses into a cluster of bubbles and ringlets around the edges with a residual soapy slick across the surface. Not much in terms of lacing; just a few spots and a thin slash here and there. Great nose - tart cherries, toasted oak and a buttery quality. Taste follows nose with the addition of citric acid a suggestion of cork and a light saltiness. Mouthfeel is medium-light and perfectly carbonated for the style - not too lively, but also not still. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands and leaves a residual presence on the back of the tongue. What can I say that probably already hasn't been said - this beer is an archetype for the style. There are definitely some distinctive variations on the theme out there but this is a great place to start if you are looking to gain an understanding of the style.","Jwale73","Sep 01, 2011"

The nose is strong of tart cherries, sweet fruits and sourness, a smell that reminds me of a barbershop but not in a bad way, its clean and refreshing. The taste is of red grapes, overly ripe cherries, dark fruits, that are sweet and tart. Mouthfeel is a high carbonation that is refreshing and a lasting tart bite.

The palate is somewhat one dimensional with lots of sour cherry and a whack of vinegar. The vinegar and acidity actually cause a sting in the throat. Everything I believe that I know about beer tells me I should hate this one, but I really like it! Guess I don't know much after all. The final result is a super refreshing and super fruity beer.

It is a complex mix of sweet and tart, sour fruit combined with earthy and dry biscuit notes. It is a completely different type of taste from many other types of beers and, because of this fact, might not be loved by everyone.

4.68,9.1,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"I used a very gentle pour so as not to stir up any lees that may have been in the bottom of the bottle, resulting in just a little bit of light-tan head that quickly fell to wisps. Color was a gorgeous mahogany with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both wood-like (oak?) and vinegar, causing my mouth to pucker. Mouthfeel was medium and my initial reaction was TART! on the tongue. Once I recovered, I tasted what reminded me of my uncle's sour cherry wine, along with the vinegar/wood combination I had noted on the nose. Each successive sip became more palatable and as it warmed, I really got the oakiness more prevalently. Finish was tart and dry, perfect for this sweltering afternoon in my A/C-less house. I am celebrating just having hung a mesh curtain across the back doorway that is allowing a nice breeze to blow through without giving access to flies and other pests. One Beer Pest in the house is enough!","woodychandler","Jul 19, 2011"

Each day you would feign the pretence to visit the shores of the recending lakeline, prod about in the muck while wondering what the glowing red countenance had to offer. The air was redolent with bluebell that fateful day you crushed the poppy flowers and closed the distance. So sweet in demeanour you introduced yourself, and were treated to a laundry list of compound curse words that would make a Press Gang blush. So sweet in appearances and introduction, you could take your new baroness anywhere, to the Salons, to the racetrack, to Tinpenny alley to bet on cockfights. She was your patient, yet offensive muse.

Whereas the Duchesse is sweet on the finish, this is more tannic/cement-like and spearminty on the finish; a bit fruity; slight sweet balsamic note. This is a blend of 67% old ale (2 yrs) and 23% young ale matured in oak casks. I prefer this over the Duchesse as well as the regular Rodenbach bottling.

The oak and wood flavors follow through in the aftertaste along with hints of vanilla. The mouthfeel is like nothing I've tasted before...kinda an awkward feel. Very airy and somewhat "fluffy."

At my second go towards a smell tart cherries and raspberries penetrate through a big vinegar nose. The fruit is very welcome company to this one. The taste seems a little more balanced. Nice and sour with a forefront of tart cherries followed by a vinegary aftertaste. Oak notes underlie fruit and sourness.

Sour and sweet, there is sharp acidity, there is sugar, a dose of oak, a depth of fruit character akin to plum, raisin, and a splash of cherry.

4.24,-1.2,4,5,4.5,4,3,"This one pours out a hazy, dark, orangey-reddish brown with about a 1/2" head that dissipates quickly into a bubbly, cream coloured film. Not much in the way of lacing is left on my glass. Aromas of sour cherries, malt vinegar and rhubarb come across very strongly with subtle notes of vanilla and rich chocolate fudge (likely from the oak) in the background. As it continues to warm, I pick up some definite cheese aromas as well (fresh Gorgonzola comes to mind). Taste is quite tart and vinegar-like throughout with a sour green apple and cherry backbone. I pick up just a touch of ripe tomato hidden away amongs the other flavours as well. The finish is very sour and almost bone dry with a peppery twang on the linger. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very crisp and leaves somewhat of a tart, oily feeling as the high acidity of this brew causes my whole mouth to salivate. This is an exceptional sour that is quite complex making it a fun beer to pick out all the different flavours that arise as it warms in your glass. Because it is so sour, I'm not sure if I could handle more than 1 of these. However, this is a beer that should be savoured in order to really appreciate what's going on inside your glass. All around, a beautifully crafted Flemish Red that will test the palates of BA's of all levels.","Graham5161986","Jul 29, 2009"

Extremely robust aroma, smells very sour with nice roast malt smell. This beer has one of the most interesting taste to it. It's a sour beer but not overwhelming. The sourness is first thing your front palate picks up but is than followed by a nice roasty malt flavor to counter-act the sourness. Slightly bitter on the back palate and after taste.

Aroma is sweet red wine (lambrusco?), vinegar, stale sweat, more vinergar, sweet plums, vinegar, raisins, brandy, and more vinergar. Taste is (surprise!) vinegar, unripe plums, astringent lemon peel. I can feel my stomach shuddering in protest. No where near as crazy as the aroma though. Rather pleasant actually, after a few sips. Phwoar! This is once crazy mofo style right here! Cherry and other dark fruits are apparent after being desensitised to the vinegar. Slightly watery, with active carbonation giving it extra tang (as if it needed it).

The taste is intensely sour, accompanied by a strong tart apple flavor as well as a less strong cherry flavor. Who would have thought this would be so light and easy to drink?

4.42,3,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"The style is my favorite, but I prefer the Rodenbach Alexander which blends both the 18 month and the 6 month ales. The Grand Cru is for purists and only has 18 month aged ales. The result is that it is a bit more puckerish, a bit more vinegary, a bit more acidic, less pleasantly sweet and vinous, a bit more oaky, and a lot less cherryish than its better counterpart. The beer pours a slighly hazy ruby brown, with some head. The smell is a delight in that you get the nice oaky, cherry, fruity, musty, and slightly vinegary aroma characteristic of the style. The mouthfeel is very good as well, and you feel as though you are having a nice aperitif, port, or other vinous after dinner drink. The style is eminently unique, unlike almost every other style of ale made, so in that sense it is a must try. Within the style, I prefer the Rodenbach Alexander and the Duchesse de Bourgogne.

It has a very dry finish, reminding me of cherries and leather. Just wonderful, really. The mouthfeel is too thin, which is surprising given the depth of this offering.

The aroma is cherries, oak and booze. It smells much stronger than the 6% ABV. Taste is similar to the aroma, although the alcohol isn't strong in the taste at all. Sour cherries is the strongest thing I can taste, along with some other berries. There's definitely an acidic tart taste, but there's also a good bit of sweetness there too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with moderate carbonation. It's a bit thin, but not watery. Drinkability is good, it's not something I think I could drink more than a bottle or 2 at a time, but it's pretty good for when I'm in the mood for this style of beer.

There's also a good amount of cherry and grape, but not much in the way of hops. Other flavors in there as well (which other reviews hint might be oak).

The malt comes through and the sourness would be pleasent but the vinegar note is sending this sideways. Maybe it might have been better colder but I thought cellar temps would be best.

It had a powerful, sour aroma more fitting to a dry cider than a beer. The mouthfeel was dry as well. In the glass, it looked like a kind of murky brew, as reddish-brown colored as the mahogany decor of the bar.

The beer came out deep amber red in color, and had a slightly hazy appearance. The persistent head was one finger thick and the carbonation was light. The aroma of sour cherries and oak combined to form a wood glue like smell, which was quite mouthwatering (and no I dont usually sniff glue). The taste was balsamic vinegar sour and somewhat spicy as well. Both of these tastes made for a very dry beer that demanded to be gently sipped and be paired with some food, so I pulled out some Irish cheddar cheese from the refrigerator to accompany it. The earthy sharp cheese cut out the peppery spiciness, but the sour flavor became even more accentuated. The oak aged notes were never quite detectable under the evident acidity. I found this to be quite drinkable, despite being very different than the hop bombs I always seem gravitate towards. The mouthfeel was naturally dry and the body was on the thin side due to a near absence of residual sugar.

An almost tart cherry fruitiness detectable along with mild medicinal spirits and vinegar. Starts sweet and almost fruity (like overripe cherries or grapes). This is followed by musty cedar/oak, a touch of vanilla, and a whiff of alcohol. However, sour acidity erases all this with a Pop-rock fizz on the tongue. Tart cherries and vinegar somehow mix as the sourness climaxes into the finish. Not puckeringly sour, but refreshingly sour, especially after the sweetness early on. I was prepared to not really like this beer much, but now I cant stop drinking it. Strange and delicious. Very lively, with champagne like fizz on the tongue that works wonders with the sweet/sour balance. Might not be able to drink pitchers of it, but better than expected!","alexgash","Mar 02, 2006"

Freshly tapped maple syrup was the initial aroma, then came oak, vanilla and finished with tart bing cherries. The beer is truly revealed after the first sip.

The tartness had a bit of edge to it. Flavor starts off with tart fruits up front. The sourness is cut a bit by an underlying sweetness and woodiness. Not as balanced as the Red, but it works out better that way. A biting sourness with a hint of cherries is how this finishes. Mouthfeel is lively with carbonation and is very crisp and clean.

Still, little whisps of lace stick to the glass. First smell is sour. Lot's of citrus, cherries, and some raw malt. First taste. Whoa, hits you unexpectedly. Sour at first, then finishes with some malt and vanilla sweetness. Second taste, the sweetness becomes a bit stronger, but the sourness does not weaken. Aftertaste is a bit strong of cherries.

The sourness shocked the tastebuds during the first few sips. But this diminishes as you drink, and some cherry flavour, some sweetness pokes through. Has qualities of a red wine.

First taste was a bit surprising and definatley pleasing. A bit sour but in a very good way, countered by a slight sweetness a la cherries. Although it may seem odd when describing a beer it truely was sweet and sour. The first swill coated my mouth and delighted my pallet as the sweet and sour played a beautiful symphony on my tongue. I know it sounds cheesy but if you have tried this beer you will know the rosy crap is from the heart. Every sip brought on a new appreciation for this beer. I was crying for more when finished and will definiatley have another go at this one. I had previously tried a "sour" tasting beer but didn't get it. After this beer I finally do.

Flavour is sour/acidic/red wine vinegar-like, with strong barnyard and ensilage elements (not that I normally eat ensilage, but still...). This was my first Flemish red ale, an exciting experience! It will not be my last beer of this style.

Sour dark cherry notes and an intricate yeast profile as well as barrel aging is evident in the nose. Further dark fruit notes as well as the malt profile bordering on a chocolate-like profile. Lavish and extravagant. I'm not trying to hype the beer up at all, but this is the real deal. The right amount of sweetness balances out the lactic sourness of this beer. Complex; changes many times on the tongue with each sip. Really plays with you as it warms, I recommend the warmer end of the spectrum. Thoroughly enjoyable.

3.93,-8.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"A totally opaque red-brwon color. The very fine head fades quickly but doesn't die. The smell is of vinegar. Sourness and tart, but with some fruity and sweet aspects. The taste is what the smell makes you expect. The tart and sour aspects are so strong that they're almost not unpleasing. I got an impression of baked cookies after a while (butter and eggs). The sourness fades as I got used to the brew. The mouthfeel is aggressive and thick. It overwhelms the palate and takes time to fade. I'll try to taste this brew again in a few months, to see if the evolution of my palate makes it more easy to drink for me.

Taste: Whopping array of tart tones but it's multilayered a tartness forms on the back of the tongue then sweet fruit grapes again the wine like tone very vinous and mild chocolate tones soften the mouthfeel by applying some sweetness to the overall profile of the flavor. Mouthfeel: High carbonation in that it's spritzy on the back of the throat but it still tends to be smooth going down a medium bodied masterpiece, a step above Petrus Oud Bruin in my opinion.

This is a darker, nearly brown coloured ale with a reddish/beige cap of foam. The aromas are just like that of regular Rodenback....but intensified to a new level. A new level of lactic, a new level of sour, a new level of cherry, and a new level of smooth.

There's a trace caramel flavor and a light sweetness to meekly counter the strong lemony citrus and acidic bitterness. Tart green apples, pear and oaky wood round out the flavors.

The beer has stinging carbonation that gradually numbs the palate. There's a crisp tartness and again the flavor is very wine-like with some sweetness.
