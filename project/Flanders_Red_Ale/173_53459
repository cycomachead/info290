Not sour... heck, not even much of a light tartness. Tasting alot of oak barrel.  Mouthfeel is watery and overall impression is bland and unwhelming.  Sad that this beer is a tribute to such an awesome historical beer figure as Michael Jackson.  Were you trying to insult the poor guy by brewing this beer? It was not much of a tribute. That is for sure.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Feb 28, 2015"

Overall I was glad I got to try this -a pretty decent flanders red with nice wild yeast character and dry quality with come complexity and mild alcohol presence with a gentle wood tannin in taste -recommended.","Slatetank","Sep 30, 2014"

3.58,-4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Bottle. 2009 vintage. Bottle opens with a pretty loud "pop" and pretty much started gushing right away. Poured into a NB tulip glass a murky brown red color with a big fluffy tan head that slowly recedes, leaving some lace. The oak is pretty evident in the nose right away along with a cider apple/fruit type note. Light mouthfeel with less carbonation than I thought given the gushing of the bottle. Slightly sweet and sour flavor gives way to a bitter oaky flavor that lingers on a bit. In all honesty, I'm not totally in love with this beer and expected more.","kbutler1","Dec 11, 2010"
3.73,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed on 3/13/2010. Bottle thanks to scrizzz. Pours a semi-hazy dirty brown with basically no head just bubbles. Aroma of lots of oak, brett/acidic notes, light sweet malts. The aroma reminds me a lot of Fred from the Wood. Flavor is more sweet, just a touch acidic with light sour notes. This isn't like other Flanders red ales that I've had -- more like an oaky, bretty, sherry-ish beer. Anyway, it was pretty tasty, well done!","LilBeerDoctor","Nov 09, 2010"
3.63,-3.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,3,"About two seconds after popping the cap a slow gush falls out of the bottle into a waiting glass. Obviously plenty of carbonation as a bubbly, dense egg-white head forms and has long lasting retention and thick, foamy clumps of lacing. Color is a murky, muddy rose amber. A small layer of sediment settles at the bottom of the glass. Aroma is strong blend of fruit, oak and vinegar. Alternatingly sour and tart with cherry, cranberry, sherry, and vanilla. Taste is at first abrupt and sharp, with the acidity of the vinegar notes taken the forefront. As the beer warms, the front of the palate starts with oak and vanilla spirit sweetness. Subtly the flavors shift to tart fruit and acidic vinegar. Finish is dry, acidic, mildly metallic and extremely long lasting. Smooth body with light carbonation this overall has a very sharp, strong and potentially off putting combination of flavors, but all things considered is very balanced. Very interesting and aging nicely I assume, I look forward to having this again.","yourefragile","Oct 16, 2010"

It's not over done, and there's a hint of sweetness to keep the sour funk in check, but this beer is definitely on the sour side. Flavors replicate the nose pretty closely, though there's a bit more of a vinegar sour component then I was expecting from the nose. There's also a hint of bitterness and fruit skin in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the finish is fairly long. Drinkability is pretty good, though the amount of sour wears me out just a bit. Alcohol is well disguised, but the sour and funk would always keep me from drinking more then just a little bit.","John_M","Dec 04, 2009"

There is a slight sherry flavor to the beer but it is abrasive to the palate. Very light and watered down. Any good flavors fade out quick and leave a tea-like taste in your mouth which equals a bad aftertaste.
