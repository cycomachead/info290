I enjoyed the the very tart cherry flavors and the mild aroma of bourbon and alcohol. Maybe not something I could drink a lot of, but the 8oz I had in my glass was just right.","kkleu357","Aug 10, 2014"

4.15,2.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a tulip glass, the beer was a murky reddish color. The color was obviously the side-effect of being soaked in the cherries. A sour cherry aroma permeates the air, giving anticipation for the cherry notes to come. The initial taste is a sour cherry flavor that certainly awakens the sour taste buds on the tongue. A mild oak flavor is present with the biscuit notes obvious in observing the texture. The cherries add something to the sour flavor of this beer which continues to the sour finish. Though released in winter, this could easily be an easy drinking, refreshing summer beer.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 12, 2012"

3.85,-5.2,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Got this beer at the occupy the local option event earlier today. Pours a burnt orange color with a bit of white head. It dissipates after a little while leaving little (if any) lacing, and a bit of film and a ring around the glass. Aroma has lots of oak with some nice funk. A bit of fruity berryish aroma as well, and a bit of vinegary acid. Flavor has more oak than in the aroma with lots of fruit, some nice funk and a bit of a vinous, balsamic quality. The oak is almost overwhelming. I would love to put a bottle down for a while to see where that big oak character goes. Mouthfeel is lower carbonation than I would have wanted, but it is dry and light regardless. If it had a touch more carbonation it would have been better.","Agold","Jan 22, 2012"
3.04,-25.1,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"In this case, it may have turned out better to not have read the label clearly. Being a fan of Flanders Red, my expectations would have been even higher. However, the beer disappoints the style, but is fine for a try tonight. In the nose, the familiar Door County cherries used famously by New Glarus are clearly there. Clear sour from the trifecta of sour bugs and the oak is there if you look for it. Take a taste and the oak is now out front with a pleasant fruity sourness. Body is thin and seems to fall off the back with little to stop it. Adequate, and my perception of Central Waters has change very little: solid, but rarely stellar.","FightingEntropy","Jan 22, 2012"

The beer has a punch of vinegar tartness, while managing to be pretty mild and drinkable. The cherries are more tart than they come off as a big cherry flavor. The funk is toned down for sure, and the beer doesn't have a ton of complexity. That said, what it does, it does nicely. Very drinkable, but a bit under-carbonated. This is definitely a solid attempt. Would love to try an aged one down the road. Nice work CW!","seeswo","Jan 08, 2012"

The sour finish does a great job of tying all the oak and cherries together with the bacteria-filled brew but I'd love to see a little rise in the flavor profile. The bugs are there and offer low underlying complexity, but almost no real malt profile comes though in this one. Regardless, this is damn close to Supplication. Great job guys! I can't wait to age some bottles and experience it's development.","BeerFMAndy","Nov 19, 2011"

3.78,-6.9,4,3.5,4,3,4,"This beer poured a dark amber/reddish color. It had a very thick off white head that was about 3 fingers tall and lingered for a long time. The smell was very much bourbon, cherries, and a little bit of funk. Taste was surprisingly smooth. Up front was a lot like the smell. A lot of cherries, dark fruit, oak and bourbon. The finish was much lighter and crisp with a lighter fruit (apple, pear) flavor. Mouthfeel was really not what I expected. It was highly carbonated, which was probably why the head was so high, but very light and easily drinkable. I would love to try this again and I would love to see them bottle this one. If you ever get the chance to try it I would highly recommend it.","StayWhatYouAre2","Sep 24, 2010"
4.4,8.4,4,4,4.5,4,5,"The body is medium and carbonation is low. Overall this beer is fantastic and will really surprise people as a superior first sour offering from Central Waters. If you are a fan of oud bruins, this one should be on your radar.","alcstradamus","Aug 17, 2010"
3.68,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Draft at the Great Taste. Pours a rust mahagony color with a nicely formed white tan head. The nose is way more sour and tart fruit notes than I expected. CW really have outdone themselves on this one and was a bit surprising to say the least. Some malty type flavors up front followed by the full force hit of the cherries that impart both a sweet and sour/tart taste to the beer. Light mouthfeel. Overall, a fairly good sour that ranks pretty well but still needs a little time to fully develop.","kbutler1","Beers"
