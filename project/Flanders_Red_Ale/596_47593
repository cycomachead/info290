3.59,1.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a muddled, cloudy, opaque reddish-brown color with no trace of head whatsoever. A subtle nose, with tart cherry highlights. The beer has a tangy, sour backbone of white grape and cherry, with a slight roasting overall. The aftertaste is puckering bitter, with a subtle tartness. A dry, astringent finish at the end. More mild than other Flanders style brews. Decent, and would make a good starter for someone new to the world of sours.","GarthDanielson","Feb 11, 2012"

2.39,-32.5,4,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"O - Pretty bad beer, although don't think I hated it as much as everyone else who was drinking it. That said, won't drink it again.","AgentZero","May 08, 2011"
2.51,-29.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,"O - Metallic, fake, and cherry Koolaid. That's pretty much how I'd sum this one up. Don't try it, even if your buddy has it on his wants and another friend brings it. Bad bad tick.","Sean9689","Mar 04, 2011"
2.17,-38.7,4,2,2,2.5,2,"D - Wow! This was terrible. Upon perusing some of the other reviews it seems there is somewhat extreme batch variation. Unfortunately my experience was largely in line with reviews by Tayner, Cedromar, and PEBKAC. I'd consider trying again on-tap at the brewpub, but another bottle would frighten me.","MasterSki","Feb 20, 2011"
3.75,5.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D- I could probably finish off the whole growler of this in a sitting and not have to worry about palate fatigue. Good flavors and a decent sour kick make this a solid offering. Not as good as some of it's Belgian counterparts but still a good interpretation.","Wisconsinality","Beers"
1.99,-43.8,3,1.5,2,3.5,1.5,"The mouthfeel is alright I guess. It's admittedly difficult to think of it separately from the rest of the beer's characteristics. I am going to try to choke this one down.","andrewinski1","0"
3.78,6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"the beer pours a copper to reddish color with a thin white head. the smell is slightly tart blackberry or raspberry kind of. the taste is pretty good, its not a funky sour like with wild ales, its more of an acidic sour like somebody just squeezed a lemon into a glass of beer and handed it to you. the mouthfeel is a little puckering but not crazy sour. the drinkablility is high as there was nothing displeasing and I like lemon sourness.","rowingbrewer","Feb 01, 2011"

3.97,12.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Deep ruby/copper pour with a thin fizzy white head. Funky, musty, fruity aroma. Green apples, sour raspberries, vinegar, and funky notes all combine into a big complex flavor. Very funky and sour finish. Flavor and aroma really open up as the beer warms up. Moderate carbonation with a dry clean finish. Had this both on tap and from a bottle. Truly enjoy this beer.","muttyd","Jan 18, 2011"
3.78,6.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Drink is decent, but not great, with some tart sour flavors, some light dry bready funk, and no real booze, so it goes down well.","jlindros","Nov 02, 2010"
3.92,10.7,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, a nice flanders red that is enjoyable and drinkable but not up there with the best of the style. Worth getting a couple glasses of though.","Gosox8787","Aug 29, 2010"
3.67,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a reddish-brown color with a slight off-white head. The nose is a bit of oak along with cherry and some mild malt. Good acetic character and some definite sourness. The taste is cherries, oak, slight malt, as well as lactic and acetic sourness. Good feel and nice sour character. Drinks fairly well but is a bit one dimensional.","Thorpe429","Jul 18, 2010"
4.1,15.8,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights, a very fine head that leaves some broken lacing. Smells clean, coppery, tart. The taste is unusually toasty for the style, but I like it. Very sour, quite metallic, and even a bit dusty in the end. In short, quite like a Flanders Red. A bit tannic and puckery in the mouth, this is a little too sharp to be perfectly drinkable. Nice for a change, though.","Georgiabeer","Jul 04, 2010"

3.29,-7.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D- just ok. I don't think I would ever seek this one out again, but I'm glad I was able to try it. We also had the Cascade Kriek that blew this out of the water.","urwithdave","Apr 18, 2010"
3.62,2.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Color is relatively clear brownish red and a hard pour produces a quickly fading foamy off white head. Aroma is tart cherries, yeasty, malty, vinegary and slightly oaky. As the beer warms the flavor turns from a slightly acidic sharp vinegar taste to a fairly sweet and mild tart vinegar. Medium bodied with light carbonation results in a lingering vinegar like taste. Occasionally there are moments of very enjoyable tart cherry and sour in the taste but most of the time it is a slightly off clash of vinegar flavors and not a great example of a flanders red.","yourefragile","Apr 01, 2010"

3.38,-4.5,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"D: I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer, and that is probably a good thing. The flavor was decent for the most part, but that slight taint of metal was a bit off-putting. I don't know if I just got a bad bottle, however.","womencantsail","Mar 11, 2010"

4.35,22.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served from a chilled growler that was filled 6 days prior. The beer was brown with a hint of orange. There wasn't much head. The aroma was both sweet and sour. I picked up some cherry, musty yeast and sour funk. The taste is of sour cherries. Somewhere between a kriek lambic and a cough drop is the Flanders Red. I think I can taste a hint of sour apple in addition to the cherry flavors and maybe some pale/light malts. There is a puckering aftertaste, but also some sugar as well. I find it to be very tasty. It has a medium body and not much carbonation (this could be because of the age of the growler), There is a good lingering tingle from the sourness. I think it's incredibly drinkable for a sour beer. I don't think the puckering reaction will get old. I could drink a lot of this beer.","ToasterChef","Mar 06, 2010"
3.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - I liked this but it still had plenty of yeast and some wierdness that wasn't pleasant and I am a fan of the style. I consider it good, but not my first choice in flemish reds - drinkable and pretty sour, fits the style w/ good fruity accents","Slatetank","Mar 03, 2010"
4.6,29.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I easily enjoyed this more than KtG, which is why I'm glad I bought a growler when I had the chance.","deltatauhobbit","Mar 03, 2010"
3.77,6.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"22oz. bottle purchased at the brewery on 2/28/10. Served in my Allagash chalice at 49 degrees. Poured a semi-translucent plum color with a loose quarter inch cap that dissipates into nothing - no lacing. The sides of the glass were coated with clusters of tiny bubbles all along the sides. Nose reveals sour cherries, a little bit of wood and a corky/earthy character (weird for a capped beer). Taste consistent with nose; quite a bit of acidity in the mix, but tartness comes across as somewhat watered down. Also a faint, but strange residual aftertaste - somewhere between bready and wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied with a lively carbonation level and an astringency that starts at the tongue, stimulating the salivary glands along the cheeks and culminating in a residual burn at the back of the throat. Really nice flanders red. I had it on draft and didn't get the weird aftertaste - nonetheless, a solid example of the style.","Jwale73","Mar 02, 2010"
3.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you're at the brewpub and in the mood for a sour beer, but there are others in the style that I would choose first.","TheManiacalOne","Feb 18, 2010"

3.96,11.9,4,3,4,4,5,"Drinkability: I could drink this all day. A very nice mid-level sour that is more complex than others I have had in the style. Amazing.","tigg924","Feb 09, 2010"
4.06,14.7,4,3,4.5,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel is light, the beer is more carbonated than others of the style, but the increased carbonation adds to the flavor profile nicely. The beer is low alcohol with very balanced flavors and a nice dry finish. This is a beer that I order several pints of when sitting at the bar, and I won't have a problem finishing this bomber.","rpstevens","Beers"
3.66,3.4,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is key to this drink. It's one of the most sessionable sours I've had that still tastes good. It's not extreme and you could easily finish a growler yourself.","BearsOnAcid","0"
3.04,-14.1,4,2.5,3,4,3,"Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to try this and it was a very generous extra. However, on the whole I find it to be a not terribly offensive but poor example of the style.","boatshoes","Jul 15, 2009"
3.59,1.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability? No alcohol to worry about here but I find the green apple tartness a bit much after some time sipping. Kind of reminds me of a cider?! Hey, I hear you laughing.;^) Still, a pretty good beer overall...","Bitterbill","Jun 10, 2009"
3.12,-11.9,2,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"It could use some work. Not really a flanders. Just an awkward sour brown as it stands.","PEBKAC","Jun 05, 2009"
3.82,7.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is quite a unique style and I'm glad to see an American brewpub tackle it. The intense tartness and viscous feel held this back a bit for me but that's more style related than anything. Solid stuff here.","Kegatron","May 20, 2009"

3.6,1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"d - the beer is no doubt slightly above average. Every counterpart comes together to make one hell of a drinkable brew. My mind runs off as i write this review and i think of a lazy summer afternoon drinking pints of this while sitting off near the riverfront. This beer could definitely be exceptional given the right time and place.","Jettanbass9","Feb 20, 2009"

3.97,12.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A brown/red color (more brown than red) with a decent tan head that disappears very quickly. Sour, fruity aroma. Sweet fruit taste up front, with a sour blast following. You can really feel this in your salivary glands. Nice dry finish, easy to drink.","lordofthewiens","Beers"
3.99,12.7,3,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, tastes like a tweaked version of their Oud Bruin from last year, which to me was much more sour and less drinkable (though I did like it). Good beer.","mbrandon2w","0"
