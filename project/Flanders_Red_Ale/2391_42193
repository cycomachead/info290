4.3,1.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"long awaited for me, the cascade kriek, what a true delight! i love the use of multiple cherry types, i think it makes a more layered and interesting beer. i also like its alcoholic strength. its uncommonly strong, which i think forces me to slow it down just a bit and appreciate every sip. its dark red, foggy ruby in color, with an off white head with excellent staying power. it smells only a touch medicinal before the sweeter nature of the cherries crashes into the lactic acidity and sourness. its intense as they get both in aroma and flavor, and the cherries never lose their authenticity in the taste. that medicinal thing is now obviously a product of the higher abv, and i like what it does here, subtle but not absent. rich beer, flush body and warming in the belly. the fruit stays after the sourness subsides on the finish, which is both unique and welcomed, my tongue is in heaven. i like the density of the fruit, the body of the beer that is never for a second syrupy or thick like these can get on the cheap end. definitely brilliantly crafted. worth the wait and the hype, i love it. takes the style somewhere new, and thats always a pleasure to ride along with.","StonedTrippin","Nov 11, 2014"

The head ends up lingering as a very small creamy bubble film on top that is really interesting. Lots of sour cherries on the aroma with some vinegar there, and dry oakiness. Flavor is super sour cherries, with a light vinegar note that is balanced out by the super dry oak flavors. Really nice Kriek that highlights the cherries without being medicinal. Miles better than the Blueberry mess I had last night. Good beer!","BMMillsy","May 05, 2014"

This is the same situation here, only it's carbonated, it's far lower in alcohol, and it's beer. Truly an excellent achievement in the realm of cherry infused beers - I cannot recommend it enough.","magictacosinus","Feb 09, 2014"

There's a hint of funk and a bit of residual brown sugar but this one is all about the tart. Tart cherries and lemons rule the palette with every sip. The flavor is quite tart with bits of sugar and funk barely getting through to provide faint hints of balance. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel.

It says Kriek on the bottle but it's only because it's brewed with cherries...otherwise, this is all Flanders Red. Funky, sour, earthy, sweet, tart, robust. The thing about sours is that they are so complex but the description I come up with is simple.

There is an immense character of cherry and acid throughout with enough rich malt to balance and even push back against the tartness at times. In the end, the beer favors the acid over the sugary notes, as it should, and this makes for a refreshing beer despite its relatively high ABV. Very nice, reminds me of a blend of Rodenbach Red and Duchesse.","nickfl","Jul 27, 2011"

Scent is profound oak with hints of vanilla. Tart cherries mix well with the oaky aroma and vinegar. Taste is initially lactic vinegar with AMAZING vanilla oak flavors. The flavors are SO complimentary of each other and blend so well it's ridiculous. Tart cherries linger on the palate as the oak and vanilla slowly fade. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and surprisingly creamy. Very delightful. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic beer.

The aroma was lightly tart, sour cherries, hints of earthy and spicy notes and even a touch of what seemed like brown sugar or something along those lines. Really very well done and quite complex.

Pops, fizzes and crackles, but fades and doesn't leave much lace. Still very pretty. Nose is fruit up front for sure. Very nice dark and sour cherry profile here. Oak, vanilla, slight hint of funk, acid, and maybe a touch of chocolate and malt. Very strong nose. Reminds me of rock 'n roll, while lambic and flanders reds/browns usually make me think art with more mellow music in the background. Taste leads off fruity (dark cherry) gets sour in the middle and slinks away fairly cleanly with some malty accents sweetening and rounding it out. medium-full body with perfect carbonation that lightens things up just enough. At times, I was actually schwilling this beer, taking multiple gulps at once. Very good sign for me. overall, awesome. cascade is really taking things to the next level if you ask me. simply delicious and enough attitude and personality to really give it a good feel with a sense of place/terroir. winner. i will be putting several of these away.","timtim","Apr 09, 2011"

Much like the New Belgium La Folie, this is a lacto-sour bomb, and that is about the extent of things. If you like that, and I do, you will dig the hell out of this beer. It is a bit thin in the mouth, but drinkability does not suffer for it. The 7.3 abv stays well hidden.

The aroma is slightly funky and tart, but with decent dose of sweetness as well. Alcohol is also present in the nose. I personally don't pick up a huge cherry aroma. It is fruity for sure, but reminds me more of apple or pear. The taste is puckeringly sour. It's a sour patch kid like acidic tartness, and is not really all that funky or musty. Much like the nose, there does not seem to be any real cherry like flavors, and it is just generically fruity and quite sugary from the malt bill. It tastes good, but on the other hand I wish that there was more going on than just an enjoyable sourfest in my mouth. As the beer warms I am able to pick out some nice woody tannins, but they are buried pretty far in the background. The mouthfeel is medium and very dry, but does not get too sticky and it is quite refreshing. It is a fairly drinkable beer, and the ABV is well hidden, except for in the nose.

The smell is pretty good. The taste, of course, starts out with cherries, and it has a bit of tartness. A nice subdued tartness, but there's enough to balance the sweetness of the fruit. The beer is not too acidic, either. The acidity is quite subdued. I can taste a little malt, and there's a slight toastiness, which is different and nice. The funkiness of the smell doesn't translate directly to the taste, but I do get some lingering funkiness, musty fruit, a little straw, and a finish that has a nice blend of sweetness and tartness. The body is medium thin, with decent carbonation. It's smooth and mellow, and the alcohol is not incredibly noticable. It's pretty good, actually a little refreshing, I'm surprised to say, and the bit of toastiness keeps it interesting, still a litle too strong and rich for another beer afterwards.","taylorhamrick","Jun 04, 2010"
