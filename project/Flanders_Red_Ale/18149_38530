Heard people age this which had me suspicious given its only 5% (and has lager blended in?) but now that I tasted it i'm even more confused. If the fruit faded anymore it would be gone altogether. If I hit the bottle shop and cant find anything else to waste money on I may just put one away for a year or two. Glad I had it but... NEXT.","Coldstorage","Sunday at 10:41 PM"

It is aggressive and may not be for all beer drinkers, or even sour drinkers.  If you dig the style go with a classic American interpretation of it.","SLubeski","Mar 31, 2015"

Pours dark reddish brown slightly murky, with a big airy khaki head on top. Aroma of lots of cherries, sour vinegar, oak, some toffee. Flavor is sour cherries, acidic tones, vinegar, and an unexpected wave of chocolatey flavors and vanilla oak tannins. Earthy spicy undertones. Interesting. Medium bodied, feeling a bit heft for only 5%, with lots of carbonation. Very interesting brew, and pretty unique.","BMMillsy","Jul 25, 2014"

What comes out is a great sour that really showcases the essence of the whole cherry; the skin, flesh, juice and even the pit. I really appreciated the strong vanilla character imparted by the oak barrels that is often missing in a lot of sour beer. Recommended.","flayedandskinned","May 20, 2014"

Im not a huge fan of cherries so I was happy when the smell of them was there, but not so much in the taste. Taste brought me back in time for some reason, very old tasting and earthy with a smooth finish once you get past the initial tart. Also tastes a little wine-like. My biggest complaint was the price of this bottle. I dont think I'll shell out the money again so unfortunately this might be my one and only red poppy. Glad I tried it though.","EveningCordial","May 17, 2014"

Funk is the primary aroma here, like well-ripened Roquefort, but a second after it smells slightly like caramel. Excellent carbonation, resonating on the tongue, but dryly. It's not as tart as I expected, considering the style, but it's very sophisticated; some flavors almost go undetected. I get tastes of lemon verbena, Merlot, blood orange, and balsamic reduction. I'm drinking this a little too quickly, but can barely contain myself.","beerloverofbham","Aug 08, 2013"

Nose of sour cherries with some hints of fig and oak with sour funkiness. Taste was verytart and sour up front with a surprising nice hop bite. Good lingering sweetness and hoppiness. Good mouthfeel, easy drinking and refreshing despite its complex flavors. Overall, this was an awesome beer that I would love to have more of. Definitely a beer to seek our if you enjoy flanders reds.","CarolinaKev","Jul 03, 2013"

The brewing process was well thought-out here, balancing the acids produced by the wild yeast with the mellowing and sweetening effects of barrel aging and cherries. I would be interested in trying this beer either from a fresh bottle or on tap for comparison. Although this is an excellent beer and worthy of much of the hype surrounding it, I don't believe it's great enough to justify the $20 price-tag.","Zive","May 22, 2013"

I was hoping for a bit more crimson on the pour, because let's face it, I like to be shallow and judge my beer by its looks at first. It was more of a brownish color, with a hint of blood to it. I used a tulip, and it foamed up right away. I had to let it sit to finish the bottle, and as it fell, it left some nasty-looking splotches on my glass. Since the looks didn't quite work out, I had to go after the personality. First off, it just blew sour cherries in my nose, followed by a tart, sour cherry flavor, and then a crisp, satisfying finish of, you guessed it - sour cherries. It wasn't that eye-closing sour, but indeed it was tart. It didn't linger too long, leave too much of a puckering aftertaste, but instead was watery enough to do its thing and then pick up and go home. I genuinely loved this beer, but for the price, I'd only have it again as a gift.","yankeepride","Apr 05, 2013"

4.05,-5.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer tastes largely sour with definite notes of sour cherries, though they are weaker than I would hope for. Caramel malts are present in the background as a faint hint, but the sour cherry funk is the dominant thing. Yeast notes give a slight sour apple and slight barnyard and hay notes, as well as slight buttery notes in the middle of the taste, and the beer is nice to sip slowly. The mouthfeel has strong under-pricklings, but overall the beer is smooth and creamy. The tongue is left slick with saliva and a slight after taste of cherries and sour apples, the middle of the tongue is also dry but sticky. The real star of the mouthfeel, however, is how the beer mellows its own effervescence out into a smooth velvety embrace on your tongue. Overall this is another tasty Flanders red. I didn’t like this as much as Oude Tart, but I think I liked it more than Rodenbach’s Grand Cru. It’s worth a try for sour lovers, and I am very happy to sample a full bottle from The Lost Abbey, though their pricing on the East Coast is a far too much for my budget. Worth a try, but not worth continued sampling.","Maxwell","Oct 05, 2012"

Pours a very hazy brown/reddish color. nice fluffy head fills the glass, an offwhite color. Smell- tart cherries, sour cherry pie, a little bit of a salty aroma as well. Layers of cherries and sugar in the aroma. Taste- hot dr pepper! a nice tart and funky blast of cherries, puckering sour at the end. The tight carbonation makes for a dry finish. Some horse blanket funk coils with the tart sweetness from the cherries. There are layers of flavor with this, its wonderful. One of the better Flanders styles I've ever had.","lnashsig","May 24, 2012"

3.83,-10.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a snifter, the beer is a deep, hazed, auburn-brown coloring that pours with a ton of carbonation. Low profile, thin, off-white head that quickly settles out into a filmy ring around the surface. Aromas of juniper and jasmine floral highlights on a dark, rich, black cherry and currant sweet backbone. The increased carbonation keeps the body thin, and gives the sour notes an extra punch. Syrupy sweet flavors transition into an earthy, wine barrel characteristic. The aftertaste is sour and sweet at the same time, with an effervescent feel. The finish is sharp, but light, with a bubbly feel left across your tongue. Tangy and puckering at the end. Good brew.","GarthDanielson","May 22, 2012"

Flavor is oaky and mildy cherry and vanilla sweet through the body before a strong acidic sourness builds long into the finish. Medium thick body with light carbonation.

Poured from corked 375mL bottle to Cuvel tulip the beer pours a dark amber brown, opaque and cloudy. The red tones of the amber are highlighted in the edges in the light. 2 finger off-white/tan head with nice retention and lacing. The nose is a blend of sour, oak, vinegar, funk, dark fruits, and tart apple. Blended well together the aroma is appealing. Similarly the flavor begins with an oaky funk at first that develops to a tart, slightly sour, vinegar cherry sweetness. Mildly bitter and well balanced. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Finishes tart and sweet with a lingering full palette sour. Very good. Overall, the price tag has kept me at bay for years but I am glad to have pulled the trigger finally.

4.12,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Big thanks to Soonami for hitting this want. 375ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash tulip at 48 degrees. I believe this is last year's vintage (2010?). Pours a brownish hue with reddish highlights; clarity is semi-translucent. Head is loose, one inch and tan-colored and eventually settles into a consistent 1/8th inch skim. I love the nose on this beer - tart cherries, vinegar, cork and a faint briny character. Taste is somewhat consistent with nose; however, the sour cherries have definitely faded, but there is still quite a bit of residual tartness and acidity as well as the merest suggestion of the barrel. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light). The carbonation is very assertive and a bit prickly; however, not gassy. The carbonation, coupled with the acidity, leaves quite a bit of residual tingle along the sides of the cheeks and across the tongue. Finish is actually quite dry. Overall, I have to say that I prefer this beer fresh as you definitely loose the tart cherry in the flavor profile. That said, this is a very good beer and for someone who really digs the sour component; it will definitely improve with some age.","Jwale73","Dec 14, 2011"

Feel is light with a fizzy level of carbonation, which adds to the experience. Red Poppy is a wonderful example of a Flanders Red. Tart, dry cherries and a light fizzy body make this a joy to imbibe.

Intense cherry aroma, also cherry-like brett. character, tart to the nose, deep roasted oak. This is like a darker malted Belgian Kriek with little to no wheat character. Low Ph, with an appealing range of acid flavors. Tartness is very enjoyable. I'm glad I aged it. Balanced perfectly. I'm really impressed, this is the best American Sour I've had.

Head retention was OK, and there isn't much lacing left on the glass. Aroma is mostly tart, the brew smells like tart cherries, oak, vinegar, and some funk. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some red grapes noticeable too. There's also a long lasting tart finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it has high but soft carbonation which eases up some as the beer warms. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, it's easy to drink and quite enjoyable. But because of the high price ($16.99 a bottle), it's going to be a very long time before I consider buying it again.","bluejacket74","Oct 20, 2011"

4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Tasted a 2008 vintage (courtesy of Jeff) alongside the newer vintage from the BIF. Both pour a cloudy russet-sunset sienna topped by a half-finger of dirty cream foam. The nose of the '08 comprises light vinegar, cherries, cinnamon, raspberries, and a rich red wine. The newer vintage, on the other hand, comprises red apple, cinnamon, maple syrup, oak, graham crackers, and light chocolate. Definitely more tart fruit in the aged version. The taste of the '08 holds notes of tart-ish black cherry, raspberries, black currant, light cocoa, graham crackers, cinnamon, and clove. The newer version is somewhat similar, with notes of tart cherry, black currant, mandarin orange, clove, and sharp raspberry. Both bodies weigh in at light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, a great beer with or without a few years on it.

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The wood characteristic of this one really added to the overall enjoyability (is that even a word???) of the beer. The sour/tart notes were spot on and not too harsh allowing the cherry and raspberry to shine through as well. Just a well put together brew that I enjoyed quite much.","thagr81us","Jul 11, 2011"

I'm not always a fan of the Flanders sours, but this tones down the creamy sweetness of a Duchess into a mellow cherry and strawberry character over biting citrus and sour tang.

3.95,-7.7,4,4,4,3.5,4," Flavour initially brings out the cherries with a touch of sweetness, but this is very quickly overcome by an intensely sour / tart follow-up, augmented with the oak barrel quality that seems to only intensify this puckering sourness. Definite red wine quality as well. This is one of my favourite style's , but this ale is more between rosso & marrone and a cantillon kriek , just to sour for the style! though I recognize the high quality in this ale.","beerpirates","May 24, 2011"

3.94,-7.9,3,4,4,4,4,"Overall I appreciate that Red Poppy is not as sweet, syrupy and acetic as a Rodenbach but there's a part of me that doesn't fully grasp Lost Abbey's approach here. It seems like some sort of weird middle ground between Flanders Red and American Wild. They've eschewed convention by making it more sour, so why not eschew convention some more and make it the best beer it can be? I guess that's what they did with Double Cherry Red Poppy.","jlb502","May 19, 2011"

I will say as a disclamer that I am not a "sour beer" guy but I found this to be a very approachable beer to the average craft beer consumer. The poppys left a distinct yet balenced aroma and flavor that lingered on the tongue pleasently as the sour notes fade from the pallet. The price for a bottle is in the "premium" category to be sure, but it is well worth it and I look forward to re-visiting this fantastic beer soon.","Hoppynanobeer","May 16, 2011"

Tasty, just sour enough. Overall a great brew","Urbancaver","May 14, 2011"
4.03,-5.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,3,"O: Overall, a great example of the style. Though I must say Im sort of getting lost in Flanders type sours. I cant exactly say what would make this one stand out in the crowd.

4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"reddish-brown (with orange highlights?), tan head. not tons of lace or retention, but wasn't really expecting much. nose has a huge cherry presence that seems to be amped up by the vanilla flavors coming from the wood. lots of fruit, leather, wood, some vinegar and vanilla seem to dominate to me. taste is all of the above with some bretty notes mixing with the cherry seamlessly, and coming off in very good balance. sweet and sour and earthy, just like i like them. medium body. almost silky. good clean finish. well carbonated with a tingling sensation as it hits the palate. overall, very, very good. the price hurts, but good things take time, and that is where the high price tag comes from I suppose. wonderful beer. highly recommended.","timtim","May 13, 2011"
3.95,-7.7,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Notes: A tasty brew, but not quite as exciting as I was hoping. I think it leans a little too dark cherry for me. Would prefer a brighter, "red-er" cherry flavor.

3.99,-6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"O - For $16? Are they nuts? While it's a good beer, it's certainly not worth that in the least. Decent and drinkable but hardly worth getting again, for me anyway.","BeerFMAndy","May 07, 2011"
4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a dark and dirty creek water brown. It has a billowing three finger beige colored, frothy head that resembles that of a rootbeer float. It smells of both sweet and sour cherries. It has a superb tartness. The flavors are sweet and tart simultaneously. The cherry flavors are pretty complex and superbly crafted for the style. This is instantly one of the best Flanders Oud Bruins that I've tried to date. The finish is both dry and sticky. Overall this beer is phenomenal. It has great flavor and isn't vinegar ridden like some FOB can be. I greatly recommend this one.","aasher","May 06, 2011"

"DONT GET CAUGHT ON THE FRONT LINE, WE ARENT HERE FOR SWEET" He had been told this many times, the initial sweet sentry tastebuds fell effortlessly under his tart scimitar. With an aerialists grace he imparted sweet blood on the front gates of the toungegrounds, charging directly to the back. This smash and grab had been rehearsed time and time again within the confines of his 6 month conditions, directly to the bitter, hit the sour and escape. With rote skill and a pike jump the bitter taste faction was seamlessly integrated, their sensory necks broken, neurons lithely hitting the ground as the tary cherry warrior continued his flay into the dark abyss.

I like that after the tartness fades, your mouth is almost as good as new; some sours will leave your cheeks devoid of moisture and tissue, but not this one. Drinkability is aided by this, along with the refreshing nature of the cherries in each sip. A tiny droplet is enough to bring about the sour beginning to the beer, and that's good since the beer is so expensive. Well worth it in my opinion though.","veinless","Apr 28, 2011"

The head has decent lacing, but this beer quickly settles as I swirl it around the glass. The very fizzy head reveals a tart cherry, slight vinegar, oak, and acidic aroma. Some apples and leather in the nose as well. This is actually one fantastic smelling beer, which is why I was slightly disappointed with the flavor. Tart cherries, oak, vinegar, barnyard funk, and slight sugary sweetness. Very sour beer. Almost feels as though the flavor is a bit held back.

Uh oh. This stuff looks like flat cola. With lots sediment. Smell is an improvement over appearance, but that isnt saying much. Has the familiar lost abbey wild characteristics, sour lactic acid, a bit spicy, sour cherries in the background. Maybe a hint of yeast as well. Taste is what I remember red poppy tasting like. Very sour with a hint of ripe red cherries, no residual sweetness, mostly just lacto sourness. Mouthfeel is pretty bad. This beer is still, the mouthfeel is medium heavy, and the sourness of the beer gives you the feeling in the back of your throat like you just ate a bag of sour patch kids.

Poured into a tulip of some sort, reddish brown, with a bit of carbonation. On the nose, I picked up red wine vinegar, oak and some tartness, but oddly (?) not a whole lot of cherry. This one was a bit funky on the palate; not a whole lot of sour going on, and somewhat lacking in cherry flavor. Again, not a huge sour fan, but this one seemed a bit restrained, almost a "training wheels" type of beverage. Pretty good, and one I'd love to try again.","emmasdad","Mar 23, 2010"

The smell is full on aggressive malt vinegar (where's my Arthur Treachers?) over sour cherries and dark grapes. The flavor and feel merge into an immediate bright tart burst that's notches shy of 'puckering'. Taste is a good mix of grape and cherries. The texture is light body cleans up quickly...almost dry, but the fruitiness lingers nicely. It's not flat, but the carbonation is hidden beneath the zip from the sour character.

This beer pours a muddy garnet with just a wisp of of a head leaving no lacing. I poured this pretty hard to try to work up a head but alas, nothing. Along with no head came no lacing. The aroma is amazing. Tart pie cherries up front, balsamic vinegar, oak, and a wicked lactic tartness. The flavor matches and exceeds the taste. Simply marvelous. Huge tart pie cherries and balsamic vinegar push up front but leaving enough room for fresh oak, lactic tang, and a sublte sweetness that lingers on the palate at the finish of the taste. The mouthfeel is exceptional. Just a light carbonation that prickles the tongue, leaving the palate slightly dry and craving another sip. This beer is exceptional.","hwwty4","Sep 30, 2009"

Taste starts out with loads of tart sour cherries that lasts the whole time. Some dank earth notes along with some oak and vanilla come into play as well as a light brown sugar sweetness.

"Red Poppy...You have my attention!" First sip is puckering sour that wakes the glands deeply from hibernating inactivity - I'm impressed. The taste is best described as chomping into an engineered hybrid fruit created equally from apricots, cherries and lemons. This is a clean sourness that bites you hard but with complete control. Red Poppy is in charge here...yes sir! I am only its lunch and I'm grateful Red Poppy picked me to attack. Mouthfeel is over the top. It first appears to be under carbonated, probably from its oak barrel rest - and it is.

Smell is mighty funky, with cherries, lactic acid, and oak. Quite sour, but not overbearing at all. The sour cherries really make themselves known, along with some lemon flavor, and that tiny Oud Bruin sweetness right at the end. Body is light, with no apparent hop profile, and less carbonation than was expected. Some might find this difficult to drink, but I love sour beers, so it was not a problem. Awesome beer from the Lost Abbey, those guys truly are great at what they do. Worthy of the hype in my opinion.

A robust leather and mildly earthy tone is present, rather umami-like. An excellent nose. The palate is a lot more robustly tart with plenty of vinegar, a blend of balsamic and red wine with a cherry skin tannins tempering and complementing the bright sourness. The cherry fruit itself has fallen off here, all that's left is the fruit pits and skin. Robustly leathery and earthy on the mid-palate, with a little vanilla for respite. There is some lactic acid that's also present, cleaning up on the finish.Light in body with supple tannins, moderate carbonation and cleaning lactic acid character. Not particularly funky, I imagine a blend of HotD Michael (at age 1) and Rodenbach vintage would taste similar. Nowhere close to what it was fresh-ish, but better than more recent batches IMO.

Some spotty, short-lived lacing clung to the glass and there was a slow, steady stream of bubbles rising to the surface throughout. Tart, fruity aroma of freshly picked berries still unwashed, cherry skins and mild vinegar. Quite earthy, with notes of tobacco and musty hay. Some bread and oak were present too. The taste was fruity and tart up front, a mixture of lactic sourness and just a bit of vinegar, with a raspberry quality yet more of a cherry flavour. This gave way to brown sugar and bread, plus a hint of toffee and chocolate towards the end. The occasional flash of vanilla appeared as well. Earthy notes of tobacco and berry skins, with just a bit of oak flavour, added some depth. Lingering, tart finish. Medium bodied with a bit of a sugary texture and lingering dryness from the oak tannins. Carbonation was average, perhaps a little on the high side. Highly drinkable, but definitely worth savouring.

The buttery oak notes really seem to dominate the aroma of this brew after a bit, though I wouldn't say that it get over-whelming, it just does overwhelm all the other aromatic components.

I guess Poppies will always be associated with Flanders after the "Flanders Field" association. Pours a murky reddish/orange brown with a slight head, but what head there is surprisingly sticks around as a swirl of light foam for a very long time. Smells quite acetic, with some red fruit, a bit of leather, and a touch of funk right at the end. Taste is marvelous, and quite complex. Starts sour with a bit of spiciness and more red fruit and plum. It becomes more minerally, funkier, and woodier. The finish is both spicy and funky with flavors of aged, runny cheese. The fruity sourness persists throughout. Delicious and very balanced. The oak contributes some funkiness, and some light tannins, but there is no flavor of new oak or vanilla. The mouthfeel is pure and acetic, but benefits from the light tannins lending some structure. A complex beer, as complex as much stronger beers. Tremendously drinkable and ebjoyable.","Georgiabeer","Mar 03, 2008"

I kind of would have liked to have just a touch more. Regardless, we are still bringing the funk here. Feel has a good liquid and carbonation to it. This is very easy to drink for a sour beer.

4.85,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Overall this one literally floored me. I have loved everything that has come out of Lost Abbey, and not being biased, but seriously, who else is this consistent with quality, I mean it seems everything new they put out is better then the one before that, its almost unheard of. This was just tremendous. A light fruity sour ale that had me literally giddy with excitement. This was something not only I would gladly have again, but that I would be actively searching for more of. One of the best I have ever had.","mikesgroove","Jan 31, 2008"
4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Pours a murky autumn brown color with a half finger head that quickly dies down to a paper thin layer of bubbles which remains throughout. Swirling the glass yields a small amount of lacing, but nothing more. Smell is tart cherries, sour apples, and slight oak notes. Some floral aromas as well. I'm not too familiar with flowers, but there is a bit of a rose scent to it. Pretty funky in the nose through and through, but not overpowering by any means. Sour fruit tartness up front of cherries, grapes, and apple with a leather like flavor as well. The fruit on the tongue isn't nearly as strong as I had expected. An interesting malt character finds its way in the mouth as well. Aftertaste is a tangy wood flavor. This one really has a wonderful feel to it. Fluffy and smooth from start to finish with a perfect carbonation. Leaves the mouth dry and begging for more. The combination of the amazing mouthfeel and low abv makes this pretty easy drinking. What a truly unique beer.","BeerTruth","Jan 30, 2008"
4.62,7.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D- If you enjoy this style, or sour in general this is a great brew. 1 bottle is definetly enough for me. I think this would pair excellent with food.","m1ked","Jan 29, 2008"
4.37,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Very good brew, and I'm very glad I got to try it, but not my favorite offering from The Lost Abbey. I got my four bottles, and have already traded one away to a nearby BA. I'll likely enjoy my bottles sooner rather than later given that Tomme says there was no brett added to the bottles, so I'm not sure that this will change much in the bottle.","srroos","Jan 26, 2008"
4.77,11.4,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Sampled in a small tulip at the release on 1-19. Tons of sediment in my glass compared with little to no sediment in the glasses around me. I though about sending it back, but decided to let it warm up and settle for 20 minutes while I waited in line. After about 2 minutes I started sipping it because i just couldn't wait. First aroma is that of overripe cherries with some brettamyces in the background. Mouthfeel was tart and slightly puckering aftertaste. Hint of green apples and caramel malt in the finish. I am new to this style but I loved the balanced effervescense which made it quite drinkable. Not as sour of a finish as its cantillon counterparts.","drewmprs","Jan 24, 2008"
4.29,0.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I was also unprepared for the taste - light but very tangy. I didn't really like it at the time. It finishes fairly dry, and it took me awhile to grow into the tartness. I was also slightly off-put by the presence of the cork floating into my mouth. I'm going to hold on to one or two of these bottles and see how they are in a year, maybe the next time Red Poppy rolls out.","aromatorio","Jan 24, 2008"
4.47,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had a taster at the release in a small port wine glass. It was suppose to be on tap but for some reason this one was from a bottle. Poured a cloudy reddish brown with white head nice lacing.( the guy next to me had a clear reddish brown, guessing I got a sample from towards the bottom of the bottle) Nose is sour cherry with Lost Abbey funk and hint of malt and oak. Taste is smooth in fact very smooth for a sour. Nice balance with cherries that are both sour and tart, malt sweetness, and mild dry oak finish. Mouthfeel is medium body with a good carbonation level and dryness. This is a great drinking Oud Bruin very easy to drink for the style and very balanced and layered. Bravo","sfoley333","Jan 19, 2008"
4.47,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, this one started to go downhill fast. I did hear from Tomme that this one should not be aged and I agree.","seaoflament","Jan 19, 2008"
4.7,9.8,4.5,4.5,5,3.5,5,"On tap and poured into a small flute glass at The Lost Abbey. Pours a pretty clear but noticeably unfiltered light brown. The smell is tart, the cherries are apparent but definitely not as strong as when we sampled at the barrel tasting in August '07. The taste is tart, slightly acidic, the cherries come in mostly at the beginning of the sip, and it finishes with a medium dryness. It's definitely not as sweet I will have to re-update this review when I try a bottle.","MiScusi","Jan 19, 2008"
4.52,5.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"There's some malt sweetness in here, and maybe a hint of lighter fruits ... maybe some plums or figs. The overriding flavor, though is a semi-acidic soury base over oak. Delicious, very drinkable. The mouthfeel is a fascinating dry, champagne-esque finish that really makes the flavors in this pop. Perfect carbonation. One of the most enjoyable "mouthfeelable" beers I can recall. I love the dryness.","Overlord","Jan 19, 2008"
4.63,8.2,4.5,4,5,4,5,"Dark reddish brown color, a hint of funky sourness in the nose, very mellow cherry sweetness and sour flavor. This one just gets better and better the more you have it in the same day. Truly amazing. I had this one with Tomme and Vince at Port Brewing after getting out of work at Stone Brewing. They told me that this is essentially Le Woody Brune with a new name. Can't wait until it is released!","EmilNoldSinclair","Nov 27, 2007"
