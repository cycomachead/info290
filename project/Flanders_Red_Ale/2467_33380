4.22,6.8,4.25,4.75,4,3.75,4.25,"The beer pours a gorgeous, muddled pink, almost like a fruited Berliner Weisse. It sits in the glass a regal, dark purple color with maroon and ruby hues. The beer pours with a head of miniscule, creamy white bubbles that form a pillow, and then quickly settles into a fat scrim around the beer. In body, the beer is dark and hazy, but clear of particles and cloudiness. On the nose, the beer smells of light vinegar, cherries, leather, and nearly vinous. Touches of grape and soft plum dance on the edges of the scent along with rich vanilla from the oak. The funky leather and cherry scents are earthy and rich with vinegar, which I adore, but they are also constrained and mellow. The nose of this beer revels in subtle complexity; it is funky, but not in a way that would kick your nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart with acidity, sweet with fruity malt, and bitter with oak tannin. The oak leaves a strange twinge to the pucker in your cheeks. The beer finishes dry and tannic. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet plum juice, tinged with tart cherry leather, this bulls head on into a wall of rich, oak tannin that blankets the middle of the sip, all but obliterating the fruity notes and bringing vanilla, earth and finally a touch of chocolate into play. Touches of grape juice and rich red wine can also be sensed in the start of the sip, while the finish is long and decadent with oak, vanilla, touches of tart grapes, and bitter herbal tannin. The aftertaste is hard to distinguish from the finish, as the beer has tremendous lasting power in the mouth. For all intents and purposes, the finish and the aftertaste are the same. In body, the beer is on the light side of medium, with a middling carbonation that gives a nice pillow to the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth, if a bit watery, providing superb drinkability until the beer hits the back of the palate. In the back, the tannin does touch with a quick bite of astringency, but this quickly fades to just leave a bit of tightness in the tongue. The mouth is left slightly dry, with just a touch of saliva oozing in to cancel the lingering acidity of the beer. Overall, this is yet another superb Flanders Red. This particular beer revels in the rich character it gained from unique Bordeaux cognac barrels. Admittedly, I have not drank a lot of cognac from Bordeaux (I thought Cognac could only be made in a region surrounding the town of Cognac?) but I think an experienced Cognac drinker would definitely find subtle hints within this beer reminiscent of that drink. This is a Flanders Red of subtle intrigue and beauty, like a fine red wine. It unfurled on my tongue like a puzzle, and I very much enjoyed that. My chief complaint with the beer comes from its thinness. I want my Flanders Reds to be medium bodied, and this one is just a little too far below this bench mark for me. It is superbly drinkable, but loses a little oomf. The beer’s tannic structure also allows it to grip the mouth quite nicely, and provides some amazing complexities, though it is a little too raw for my personal tastes. In the end though, it’s a great Flanders red.","Maxwell","Feb 16, 2014"

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like tart cherries, oak, green apples, funk and vinegar. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like tart cherries, grape juice, dark fruit, oak, green apples and vinegar. Even though it's mostly tart, there's some fruity sweetness noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and is well carbonated. I think this is a good, tart, enjoyable brew. Definitely worth a try, I'll have to get another bottle to age and see how it turns out. $16.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jul 21, 2013"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; Bottle #1048, Batch #9, 2007 vintage. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of sour cherry, green apple, red grape, pepper, clove, floral, oak, hay, red wine vinegar, funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast notes with moderate oak barrel presence. Taste of tart cherry, green apple, red grape, floral, clove, oak, hay, red wine vinegar, funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity and earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, green apple, red grape, clove, oak, floral, hay, red wine vinegar, funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity, tart, and earthy yeast ester flavors; with moderate malt, oak, and acidity; and a great sweetness/acidity balance with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders red ale. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity, tart, and earthy yeast flavors with moderate malt and oak balance; and very smooth to sip on for 8% with the moderate acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 23, 2013"

Flavor pushes those components a bit further, but also has an underlying tannic graininess that detracts a bit, especially from the mouthfeel.

Cherries and dark fruits with a nice amount of oak. A bit of sour funk and red wine vinegar. More oak. Taste is a lot better than I was expecting. From reading some of the reviews, I have always passed this beer up. Right now I'm kinda wondering why...it is quite the treat. Immediately I get wooden oak flavors...like literally licking a piece of oak wood or something...which instantly changes to tart cherries and blackberries. Just a slight off-putting metallic flavor, but it comes and goes, so not really detrimental to the overall taste. I could see why people say this beer is somewhat watery...but I think it's just more balanced and oak forward than a lot of sours we get here in the states. Could have something to do with the cognac barrels this is aged in, as I do get some alcohol flavors lingering on the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is light-medium and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a tasty beer. Not as sour as I tend to like my sour beers, but the oak flavor is great!","DovaliHops","Feb 10, 2012"

The sour oak flavor comes through even stronger in the taste. The fruit characteristics are still there, but instead this is a bit more intense and souring on the tongue. Again this from what I've been told is by design. Aside from the sourness the mouthfeel was syrupy but fairly close to the target.

The taste follows this path, along with some oak and sour blue raspberry, which all then tapers into some sweet blueberry and black grape in the end.

Aroma is full of buttery oak, acidic, some notes of cherries, apple skins, light citrus, some mustiness, Belgian yeast, and a touch of vinegar. Flavor is dry and tart. Cherries are the most predominant of the fruit character, but it's a tart cherry flavor and yet not completely sour. A little bit of caramel and brown sugar lie deep in the back of the flavor profile, but it's there only momentarily until the dry, tannic tartness washes it away. Oak is not as noticeable on the tonuge as it is in the nose, but it is there, and adds a nice touch. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, on the medium-light side, and the warming alcohol is noticeable on the finish. Not as refreshing as most Flemish Red's I've had. It's definitely a sipper, especially at 8% ABV.

The smell is a very deep and light funk. Not very strong, and just a bit less than I expected. This one comes out with a bit off sourness, quite a lot of tartness, and a pleasant sweetness. This one reminds me a bit more of beer than the average Flanders Red. Has notes of raisin, chocolate, caramel, and a tiny bit of breadiness. The sourness comes off first like sour candy, then comes in with lime juice, and finishes with a bit of woody sweetness. I like it. I've had a few which are more impressive, and I may be a sour hound, loving every one I taste, but I think it's got everything it takes, but not the wow factor. The carbonation is just perfect, pleasant great. The body is quite full. Moreso than I expected, and it almost feels warm at 50ish degrees. Very nice I'd say.

The smell is typical of the style, albeit with a less pronounced vinous aroma. The taste is where things wildly diverge. This ale is a bit too vinegary, not nearly mouth puckering sourish enough, not nearly as candied cherry tart flavored, and a bit too watery and carbonated. I'm obviously very particular in what I prefer in the style, and this beer doesn't measure up nearly enough as I would have liked. It is also quite expensive. I'm warming up to it though, and I'm not panning the beer by any measure. I just feel that if you want the real deal, go to the Belgian font and experience true heaven in a bottle, rather than an Italian imitation.

Sour grape and wine-like aromas predominated with an accent of sweet malt. After the initial sour shock on the taste buds, this Panil turned out to be quite well balanced, with enough malt presence and even some tasty hop bitterness in the far background. Very subtle taste; a connoisseurs beer. A distinctly red wine-like mouth feel and flavor predominates.

4.24,7.3,4,5,4,4,4,"D - The aroma of this beer is fantastic, but the flavor doesn't quite match. It is extremely refreshing with what I would consider a high level of acidity, even for the style, but it is a little too acetic for my taste. The oak character is also too assertive, or at least too coarse and woody for me. On the plus side, it has a great, complex earthiness, especially in the nose, and the roasted notes in the finish are an unusual and interesting touch. Overall, it is quite a good beer, but at nearly twice the price of Rodenbach Grand Cru it should be even better.","nickfl","Aug 22, 2007"

3.77,-4.6,4,4.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Because of its thin body and light sourness, this is actually significantly more drinkable than most Flanders Reds I've tried previously. All in all, quite nice, and something I'd be willing to share with a friend.... but probably not something I will seek out for $19 again.","nickss","Dec 20, 2006"
4.17,5.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fizzy up front but mellowing out, light funk, low acid, and apple lingering.","weeare138","Oct 23, 2006"
3.88,-1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Originally reviewed on November 28, 2006. 2005. Aroma lightly bold of cloying syrup and sweet aromatic brett sugars, more wild sourness and acerbic grape skins. Deep oaky mahogany pour, with a faint oliy slick of ivory. Flavors are subtle and breezy, honed well and designed with balance in mine. Independent bold and unique. First full of bright fruity cherry-skin aroma, followed by long sweet, lightly caramelized malts. So perceptively balance, and moving. Stewed apple amongst mixed coarse Indian spices in ghee. The cognac shines through and mellows with sweet alcohol notes. Graceful, delicate and well balanced. Refined.","CharlesDarwin","Beers"
3.41,-13.7,5,4,3,2.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a light beige color ale with a huge foamy head with perfect retention and lacing. Aroma is sour with some tart and oak and is also reminiscent of lambic but maybe a tad lighter. Taste is a mix between some sourness; tart some subtle oak with a long dry finish. I would probably have liked more sourness overall but I thought this was still very enjoyable. Carbonation is very lively and body is quite full with minimum filtration. I am now very curious to taste their other offering.","Phyl21ca","0"
