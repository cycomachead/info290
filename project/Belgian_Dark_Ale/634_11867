Classic Belgian dark aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit, Belgian yeast and hints of light apple juice. Flavor starts with somewhat subdued caramel malt, apple and dark stone fruit, and Belgian yeast, then the flavor quickly falls off leaving a slight metallic bitterness. A very odd flavor profile. Medium bodied. The initial flavor is light, but sweet and flavorful, but the finish is abrupt and off-putting. Puzzling.","LiquidAmber","Jan 28, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 2-3 finger billowing light khaki head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts forever. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass; with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of raisin, plum, cherry, caramel, molasses, herbal, candi sugar, biscuit, earth, and yeast spices. Some nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of plum, raisin, molasses, caramel, biscuit, herbal, candi sugar, yeast spices, and a bit of a metallic flavor; but it isnâ€™t too bad. Lingering notes of dark fruit, herbal, molasses, biscuit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Good flavor balance and complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Alcohol is hidden well with only a slight warming after the finish.

Mouthfeel is full with a medium dry finish, not sticky sweet. Drinkability is quite high, a relatively low ABV for the style.

Looks like a breakfast roast coffee with slight translucency. Mild carbonation. It smells like big chocolate malt, biscuit, and candi sugar. No hop smell, just sweetness. The taste is pleasant, yet out of balance. The sweetness tastes good, but there is very very little hop, dryness, or complex alcohol to round it out. This would be great with just a little kick of saaz at the end and maybe a slightly lower final gravity. This would be a wonderful base for something that could be amazing.

Scent of malt and dark fruit (figs, prunes and raisins) as well as a mild hint of alcohol. Color was ruby-brown/red; not quite opaque, but very dark with little light penetration. Mouthfeel was watery, flat and lacked any liveliness, which was quite surprising considering the head. Flavor was lackluster and the nose poorly translated into flavor.

The smell was more sour than I expected. I kind of expected more of a bready yeast aroma like St. Bernardus Pater. The taste was slightly sour too, which didn't meld well with the sugars and other flavors in the beer. I won't be getting this again.","TurdFurgison","Feb 28, 2006"

3.68,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours nice dark amber that's murky and very pater-ish. Head was a little cola-like, but laced pretty well for me. Smells of honey and grass, with those tastes leading the first sip. Middle bits are lemoned sweet tea, finishing off with stronger, more bitter black tea. Maybe some wheat bread down below all the rest. Very syrupy texture that is as bereft of carbonation as possible without being entirely flat. Despite, or in light of that, though - very drinkable.","ojiikun","Oct 30, 2005"
2.75,-23.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"No freshnessdate carved. Some yellowish head soon falling to just some loating leftovers at the side of the glas. Dark brown clear beer with red hint in it. Nose is very sweet and greenmalty and having a wortnose. Oxidation certainly did it's part in this one and wonder if botlefermentation was even started. Taste is very sweet and somehow also thin bodied. Is there sacharine in this product, dunno but certainly sweet. Some caramellic and slightly burnt maltyness also there but bitterness in my opinion low dosed even with the bitter yeasttaste that it also shows. Drinkable beer but not really my type of beer and IMO misses something.","paterlodie","Oct 27, 2005"

Hints of candy and apple along with some malt sweetness and a strong yeast note in the aroma. Some prickly carbonation and a light bitterness at the back of the throat. A hint of tabacco and some sweetness are washed away too quickly by the overall watery charater of this beer. Not bad tasting but not worth a second.","ybnorml","Jul 12, 2005"
3.36,-6.7,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Part of a 4 beer sample pack. A clear stained and varnished medium cherrywood color with a big-bubbled head that rises over an inch to begin with but doesn't last that long. Laces are attractive, delicate small patches with lots of pattern and detail. Bright aroma, slight yeast with a sweetened cherry back tone. Mouthfeel registers as light-medium, most of the carbonation seems spent on the foam. The flavor is not as layered as the smell, diminished, overtly sweet (as in unfermentables) with a sense of peach that fades into the background mid mouth. Doesn't generate much of a sense of change or deeper flavors, by the end of it there's a bit of an impression of the sugar water you put out for hummingbirds. OK quaffability, not a lot going on here, in my opinion.","ADR","Jul 07, 2005"
3.09,-14.2,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Het Kapittel Pater certainly looks the part of a quality Belgian ale. Unfortunately, it tastes like the poor stepchild of Belgian brewing. Not to denigrate American brewers (since they brew my favorite beers/styles), but what it really tastes like is an attempt by a less than talented American craft brewer to duplicate the Belgian dark ale style. While it probably isn't quite as bad as I've made it out to be, it's certainly disappointing.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 07, 2005"

Some honeyish and grainy light malt aromas mixed with some lighter tropical fruit aromas. Slightly musty and faintly hoppy. Delicately balanced, this beer is quite delicious. Faint fruity sweetness mixed with roasted malts and candi sugars and a moderate hoppy finish. Very faint pluminess. Wickedly drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable. Very faint metallic taste is slightly off, but not distracting.","crookedhalo","Jan 28, 2005"

On the palate it slides quickly into thin, sugary flavors that are weakly influenced by cliche flavors of spices, nuts and fruits. It's dry and short. One might argue that these are good "crossover" beers -- their merit being their blandness. I think that excellence is usually the surest conversion point, and this is not excellent.","putnam","Sep 03, 2004"

3.26,-9.4,4,3,3,3,4,"This beer poured a dark red amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. There was surprisingly very little aroma to this beer. What little I could detect seemed to be malt. A flavor of malt, caramel and some unidentifiable spices. The finish was almost metallic and a touch astrigent. Not really impressed with this one.","Wildman","Feb 02, 2004"

A metallic taste hits me up front, which is a turn off. It is malty and there are tastes of some dried fruit and it finishes with a yeast character. The aftertaste almost reminds me of iced tea. It is not a bad beer, but it lacks depth and complexity and the metallic notes are not good.","ark57","Jan 18, 2004"
3.6,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Bottle - Poured a deep murky amber brew with a nice huge foamy white head that's long lasting. ABV is bit too omnipresent but excellent carbonation. Taste is sweet with some quite complex mix of spice. I notice that some of the other review mentioned a metallic taste, which I have heard of before. If I recall well, the metallic taste is from the hops and usually goes away after the bottle is aged a bit.","Phyl21ca","Dec 01, 2003"
3.98,10.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Presentation: 33 cl Bottle with green & tan label with a monk enjoying a fine ale. Appearance: Nice light brown/reddish color- somewhat cloudy with a few small chunks of yeast floating in the mix. A moderate head that thins very quickly. A moderate amount of carbonation in the beer that feeds the head to keep it from disappearing completely. Aroma: Not a lot to say. I don't have the best nose around, but there is a weak aroma of malty sweetness and little else. Taste: A nice mix of sweetness with a slight bite. The sweetness is stronger. Alcohol shows up towards the end of the swallow. Some spice flavors, very subtle. Quite tasty and drinkability is high, if not overly complex like some other Belgian offerings.","Dukeofearl","Oct 02, 2003"

Heavily spiced nose -- plums, exotic plant roots, ginger, perhaps? Sweet, initial malt flavors are balanced by something of a hop presence but also by a masked acidic quality. Subtle and simple, I find this very drinkable. I feel as though I drank this too quickly to catch all its subtlties, but perhaps not. I'll have another in a month or so to see.","marburg","Aug 03, 2003"

Nose heavy malt sweetness, hints of plums, crisp and clean with the start sweet and loaded with malt, top is middling. Finish has a pleasant acidity, the hops pertinent to the style, dry lingering aftertaste, not sure I care much for this beer, and maybe another sample in a couple of weeks might change my mind, average at best.","Gusler","Beers"
