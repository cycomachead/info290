3.49,-9.4,4,3.75,3,4,3.75,"ABrown-yellow colored with hazy appearance, little yellow head. Plummy, sweet, brown sugary aroma with yeast and some grass here, decent one. Medium bodied. Flavor has some roasted side with still sweet plummy-chocolaty note here, aftertaste dries with yeast and same grass, little bit of carbonated in mouthfeel. Decent, easy to drink.","beerpirates","Sep 18, 2012"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml into Struise tulip. Tan head. Fluffy with high retention. Soapy lacing. Aroma spicy and sweet. Nice carbonation on the tongue.  Some peppery spice on taste, malty sweet, old banana like Belgian yeast with nice candi sugar flavor. Almost a chocolate flavor pops out at warming  also reminesent of fig newton a bit. Highly drinkable. ","KickbacksSteve","Dec 01, 2011"

3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Bottle shared at the May Santa Cruz tasting. Pours medium brown with an off-white head. Chocolate bready aromas with a spicy earthy touch and some raisiny dark fruit. Flavor is similar but with a distinct red fruit/berry note midway through the finish. There's also a rye-like element to the breadiness, reminiscent of Bruery Rugbrod.","illidurit","Mar 02, 2011"
4.08,6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall a very solid and lighter dark ale","mikesgroove","Feb 04, 2011"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Good, though not great, beer that was enjoyable, complex, and fairly balanced. The flavors didn't pop, but rather provide a nice easy drinking beer. I would gladly drink it but probably wouldn't get it due to the price.","FreshHawk","Feb 03, 2011"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Bottle from the Struise Yeast Store. Pours an amber brown colour with thin off white head. Some more hops in the smell than I was expecting, quite spicy too. Some mild chocolate roast it seems too, with the Belgian yeast. Smooth mouthfeel. I enjoyed this beer.","kwjd","Jan 27, 2011"
3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Ken's bottle from Struisse. A smooth light body and mouthfeel. An attractive quarter inch head. Lacey. Smooth drinker, though a bit of sourness that you will find in a brown ale. Unfiltered, a little hoppy,sugar and cinammon, good drinkability. Dry finish.","Sammy","Jan 09, 2011"
3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Not nearly as impressive as some of Struise's other brews, but nevertheless a drinkable Belgian dark.","dasenebler","Dec 10, 2010"
3.58,-7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"33cl bottle served in my DT tulip. Lot A Month M (May) 13 indicated on the label (I'm assuming this means best before May 2013). Pours a deep cider, almost plum color with a quarter inch, frothy white head embedded with ringlets. Nose expresses yeast and sweet, fruity esters (perhaps strawberries). Taste starts off slightly metallic, followed by dry, dark fruit (plums and prunes) and yeast. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation and a semi-dry finish. All and all, a somewhat bland Belgian Dark. Decent, but not a particularly engaging or memorable example of the style.","Jwale73","Nov 13, 2010"
3.92,1.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"also quite drinkable, good balance of flavours to mask any residual alcohol taste.","benclimbs","Nov 10, 2010"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours cloudy red with a big frothy head. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate; hints of spice like anise. A smokiness on the finish with notes of coffee, vanilla, and a certain grape element. Feel is on the thin side for a larger beer.","gyllstromk","Nov 07, 2010"
4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I find this beer to be very easy drinking and refreshing. No extreme flavors ensures I won't get tired of this one. Fans of Belgian beers and De Struise in particular are encouraged to try this beer.","ToasterChef","Nov 03, 2010"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"D: I was curious as to what this one would bring, and I did enjoy it. It seemed sort of like a Belgian take on an American Red/Amber ale.","womencantsail","Oct 17, 2010"
4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"On draught at upstanding establishment. Nice pour in a tulip glass, leaving plenty o' room for a large head to roost on top. Straight amber in color. I would call this a Belgian amber rather than a Belgian Dark Ale - it's not particularly dark in color or flavor. Moving on... nice malty aroma, very subtle hoppage, earthy. Nice round flavor to this - signature Struise fruityness and mild sweetness, pretty malty, with a slight earthy funk (not sour). Smooth on the palate. This is a nice drinkable ale from De Struise - not an over the top flavor assault like many of their others (which I love). Just a nice Belgian amber.","twelvsies","Beers"
3.78,-1.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"A decent drinkability with light bitterness, a decent dry finish, and very light boozy taste.","jlindros","0"
4.08,6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The flavor is very lightly sweet up front, but has a firm bitterness to it that nicely balances. Other flavors of red table grapes and currants are balanced by a touch of herbal hop character. This beer is quite nice, I like that it is dry overall; this makes for an appetizing, light beer that has a touch of sweetness (that seems like it is more from fruit notes than a sugar sweetness if that makes sense). The flavor also has that touch of mustiness and funky ripe cheese. This is a very nice, complex beer and I am really digging the complexity that the little touch of open fermentation gives this beer.","Gueuzedude","Sep 28, 2010"
4.15,7.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - This is a solid De Struise brew and I would seek it out again.","eric5bellies","Aug 28, 2010"

3.39,-11.9,4.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma is a mix of caramel and light spices. Taste is a mix between some caramel malt with light spices and limited sweetness. Body is average with great carbonation. Not bad but not even close to the best I tasted from this brewery.","Phyl21ca","Jun 30, 2010"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is alcohol with some cherries and caramel malt. The flavor is a lot of dark fruit with a little tartness and some malt notes. There is also a little brown sugar in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Jun 26, 2010"
4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Taste is slightly sour cherry and malt up front with almost a dr.pepper like finish. Mouthfeel is very light with an ever so slight warming alcohol presence towards the end. Highly drinkable with its light mouthfeel. I will most likely seek this out in the future.","STEG","Jun 21, 2010"
3.45,-10.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I would not have guessed this to be a Belgian Dark ale, but hey what can I say? Nice pretty deep amber color, slightly hazy with a very decent head. Smells of hops but not the overpowering kind, which was a nice surprise, some spicy yeasty oders in there as well and pale malts. Very clean tasting with an English biscuity malt flavor (not sure if that makes sense but that's what I wrote!) and some zest possibly from the yeast. Lighter bodied and easy to drink. The hops are held at bay and a nice clean palate is left. Nothing special but a very drinkable beer. I could drink more but would not go out of my way.","thepeter","Jun 06, 2010"
3.7,-3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A pretty tasty little beer, nothing over powering and nothing really sticks out at me. I would drink this again.","weissbierdrinker","May 15, 2010"
3.65,-5.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - A 12oz bottle was easy to drink, but I don't feel the need to have another bottle any time soon. One of Struise's less interesting offerings.","MasterSki","May 07, 2010"
3.98,3.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Highly drinkable beer. There is a lot here but it's not heavy and you could easily pound down a few of these in an evening.","randjuke","Beers"
4.08,6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange/brown color with a huge bubbly off white head that slowly recedes to a cap. Smells of bready malt, floral hops, and spicy yeast. Sweet dark fruits come to the surface as she warms. Taste is sweet with caramel and dark fruits up front. Hops and yeast gang up and overpower the malt for a half a second then the sweet candy, cherry and plum flavors win out. Long lingering sweetness after each sip. High level of carbonation, medium body, sweet syrupy mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this one. If it wasn't so difficult to obtain I might enjoy these more often.","johnnnniee","0"
