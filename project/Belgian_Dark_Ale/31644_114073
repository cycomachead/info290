4.09,6.2,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Dark black body with an off white head. Chocolate and pine on the nose. Really interesting scent that leads directly to the flavor. Light roast but semi sweet chocolate then a slight piney bitterness. The key to this black ale is the bitterness is very much in check. The roasted malt really adds a semi sweet chocolate rather than a bitter bakers chocolate or a coffee roast. That allows the hops to remain part of the flavor profile. There is a hint of citrus rind but primarily floral pine. Really nicely balanced black ale akin to a New Glarus Black Top rather than some of the overtly roasty or dank black ales out there.","PHBoiler","0"
