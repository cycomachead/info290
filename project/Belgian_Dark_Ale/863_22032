Shared this one the day after aasher’s wedding while the entire wedding party was hanging out by the pool in the Destin, FL sun! A growler gusher!?!? Served from growler into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a two finger light khaki colored head that subsided to a half finger extremely slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, roasted malt, bread, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, banana, fruit, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I was really surprised that this one held up as well as it did after over a year of being stored in my fridge. Surprisingly there were quite a few non-craft beer enthusiasts at this pool party and a lot of them really liked this brew upon sampling it. This was a good thing as it would have been hard for aasher and I to pound the entire 64 oz growler. There were lots of nice notes going on here that kept your palate guessing on each sip which was a nice aspect. It was also refreshing making it easy to drink out in the extremely hot weather. Definitely a must try.","thagr81us","Apr 14, 2012"

The nose is smooth and creamy with dry dark malt character and a touch of Belgian yeast. It's light and dry, somewhere between a Belgian Brune and an Irish Dry Stout. It's pretty mellow yet sessionable. It's a nice Belgian dark ale, just nothing crazy.","aasher","Feb 18, 2012"

Modest bitterness with just a touch of roast and mild apparent hops in the finish that bring a nice balance that barely leans on malty. Fruity with a definite yeasty touch, but also very clean.

It pours coffee black with a thin off-white head. There's a fair bit more candi sugar presence than expected. The flavor is mostly coffee/cocoa with some background malt fruitiness and a touch of Belgian yeast. I found the mouthfeel to be a bit grainy leading to a somewhat thin, watery finish.

Looks a nice dark brown with a quarter inch light brown head and good retention. Smells yeasty and biscuity with some vague fruit. Definitely smells like a Belgian style beer, but its not clear what style exactly. Flavor has definite fruit and yeasty veins. Strong malt undertone and a slight roasted note. Roasted flavor makes me think porter, but its not that by any means. A bit overly dry on the finish, where more fruit flavor would be welcome. Medium to full bodied with a creamy/frothy mouthfeel. A nice drinker, despite the dryness.","aforbes10","Feb 07, 2009"

3.11,-19,4.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"I was looking forward to trying this new creatively named valentine's day beer. Color was black, taste was dry, bitter, and to me, burnt, with a thin mouthful. I did not like it at all, but maybe my palette was too sour'ed out by Vinne's other masterpieces. I'm looking forward to trying it again, maybe with food, and maybe I'll like it more...","antilogic","Jan 30, 2009"
3.96,3.1,5,4,4,4,3.5,"Had low expectations for this beer. Was way better than I thought. Not sure why I felt this way but hey the beer was awesome. Awesome color, nice lacing / head. Balance with acidity coco coffee, not a long finish but very fun and enjoyable. Would go great with food. Glad to have tried this rare brew.","paytoplay","Jan 24, 2009"

3.38,-12,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap at Russian River brewery today. Described on the chalk board as a Belgian Black Ale, or something like that. And black it is, with a nice tan head. Smell and taste are essentially dark roasted notes, a little coffee, but lighter than a stout by far. Pretty drinkable brew, but with so many other delicious options at the brewery, one is enough.","waltonc","Jun 05, 2008"
3.75,-2.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Smooth and creamy, this is easy to drink if you know what you are getting into. Definatly not for those who just "like" beer.","dbONE","Jun 02, 2008"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4,4,5,"Pours an opaque, dark brown color with a tan frothy head that reduces rather quickly. Aroma is toasty malt and coffee with a touch of fleshy fruit. Flavor is of those See's coffee flavored candies with some roasty bitterness and smoke. Chewy and sticky. Really smooth and drinkable.","illidurit","May 31, 2008"
4.33,12.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep black, with a thin tan head. Smell is of belgiam yeast, dark chocolate and deep roasted malt. Taste is a dark chocolate, burnt malt (very much like a good porter), with a hint of the sweet, distinct belgium yeast flavor. A very good beer, that I have had the pleasure of having twice now and would get again when available.","jwolfie70","Beers"

4.25,10.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D: Great, I could drink a lot of these at 6% abv and they are very enjoyable. Obviously not as much flavor or punch as a RISs, but still a lot going on and an interesting beer (though I'm still not sure what beers to compare it to)","yourefragile","Apr 08, 2006"
3.75,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass, arrived with no head, pretty dark brown in color. Aroma is a bit odd, definitely some toasted malt in there, but can't pin down the odd funk to it. Taste is again kind of funky, the malts roasty, some chocolate... and perhaps smoked? Not what I expected out of a Belgian Dark, though not actually all that bad. Just, well, rejected:) Body is above average, good consistency and after I got used to it, it wasn't all half that bad. One is all I need though.","objectivemonkey","Mar 29, 2006"

3.55,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: Its a while since I had a dark brew from Russian River, but overall this one was not really to my palate to be honest. I made a point to try this one early on so I think I avoided the faded palate scenario. Not one of my favorites from Russian River, definitely unique, but I would give this one a whirl again if I get chance.","TheLongBeachBum","Jan 14, 2006"
3.53,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability- Fairly odd tasting beer. Kinda like a swartzbier, except not a lager. Not as sweet in the malt as well. Just odd. Worth a try though.","GClarkage","Feb 22, 2005"
3.98,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5," Hopefully some other soul can it describe better. All i can advise is to leave a style mindset at the door. It was pretty good, and although not as good as good as the top of the Russian River class, it was still a damn fine adult beverage. I myself will try my hardest to get back for another taste before it's gone and perhaps even get a growler next time.","pjwilson","Beers"
