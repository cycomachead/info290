The smooth, drinkable quality is this beer's strong point. It's no 'wow' beer, but something I think a vast majority will find at least somewhat enjoyable.","TheSixthRing","Jan 25, 2014"

4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"From the tap, Nice color, it is a Brown Ale for sure. Picked up a lot of flavors form the smell, a lot of dark fruit sweetness. Has a but of creaminess nice a smooth, finishes with a nice roasted malt taste. A slight bit sweeter then I usually go for but very good over all. Takes a few drinks to really pick out all of the flavors but it just goes to show that they are blended together very seamlessly","exodus1369","Jan 25, 2012"

4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I think a pretty great seasonal beer. Dark brown pour, and you can see the carbonation rush to the surface but it mellows out after being left to warm for a bit. Smell of dark fruit, oaky, and cherry. Rich taste, way more complex that I expected. Love the way the oakiness cuts through at the end of each sip. I feel like the taste is a good blend of things that I didn't really picture being together, and although I am not always the biggest fan of sweeter stuff, I think the flavors work really well together. There is a slight warmth of alcohol, and the mouthfeel is full and well carbonated. Definitely would buy this again. A pleasant surprise.","ely2000k","Jan 08, 2012"
3.59,-0.6,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - Good as an American-Belgian dark. Doesnt really hold up against anything from the namesake country but its a great all-around and I could drink a few. As it heated up more great flavor came out so give it some time out of the fridge.","neilgavigan","Jan 06, 2012"

3.55,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear dark copper brown with a 1 inch foamy beige head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, chocolate, and some Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is pretty malty and a bit nutty with a subdued yeast flavor. A subtle chocolate flavor comes out in the aftertaste. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good take on a Belgian ale but it could be developed more.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 19, 2011"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"T: Definitely a lot more complex than I was expecting. Roasted malt and some dark fruit hit first, followed by some hazelnut and brown sugar. I had two and enjoyed both of them a lot.","notchucknorris","Dec 19, 2011"

3.28,-9.1,4,3.5,2.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle pours darkish brown with a frothy beige head. Aroma is roasty with fresh wheat bread maltiness and some mild banana pith. Flavor is slightly sour with a medicinal artificial grape tinge atop a standard brown-malts-fermented-by-belgian-yeast-strain base. A little nuttiness too. Tastes almost exactly like New Belgium 1554, except with more body. Marginally better than the inexplicably overrated 1554.","illidurit","Jan 25, 2011"
3.75,3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A good brown ale with a remarkably enjoyable finish. There doesn't seem to be much that is Belgian about the sensory profile of this beer. The yeast does not stand out on its own, instead complementing the malt to bring out satisfying nutty character. Nor is it sour, with the acidity detected being carbonic in nature. Whether the yeast strain used was from Belgium or somewhere else, it is safe to say that it was the right yeast for the job, helping to yield a finished product that is better than expected.","beagle75","Jan 16, 2011"
3.4,-5.8,4,4,3.5,3,2.5,"Poured on-tap in downtown San Diego at the Columbia Street brewpub into a pint glass. The beer is a dark nut-brown color with hazelnut highlights, and a thin, dense head. The beer has a good aroma, with smells of nut, coriander, nutmeg, and malt. The beer flavors are coriander spices of a typical Belgian with the rounded malt and nut flavors of a Brown. The sweetness disappears on the transition to the aftertaste. The finish is a balance of clove and sweet malt. The aftertaste and finish are not great for an already struggling beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 08, 2011"
3.53,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Im enjoying this beer quite a bit it's pretty easy drinking I like how the Belgian yeast adds to the flavor of the brown ale base this is worth picking up if you see it around","armock","Dec 25, 2010"

2.86,-20.8,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Had this at Sally's in San Diego. Walnut color with a thin tan head that lasted a good 60 seconds. Was served way too cold, so there wasn't much aroma. In fact, there wasn't much aroma after it warmed up, either, although I managed to detect some caramel and apricots at some point. Mild carbonation was nice, and provided a prickly base for the dried fruit and light hops in the taste, but over all this was a rather blah beeah. I don't see much relation between this beer and any other Belgian dark I've had. I like the name, but I'd avoid another glass of this.","gfreed","Mar 26, 2010"
3.77,4.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Karl Strauss has recently put out a couple of their best beers in bottles; this and 'To The 9s'. They've done an excellent job and it is really promising for the future. I've always had mixed feelings about their beers... besides the generally solid amber ale, most of their beers have had something off in the flavor that irritated me. I'm glad to enjoy their new beers both on tap and from the bottle, and I look forward to more of them.","mithrascruor","Mar 07, 2010"
3.7,2.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Rich and complex, I think it was a bigger beer it would be harder to put down as the phenols and alcohol would have taken over but being it is a mid-sized beer it holds on to some drinkability. Good stuff all around.","Jason","Jan 24, 2010"
2.44,-32.4,4,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Uh, no. Poured a bright, clear brown with a short light tan head. Then it goes downhill. Dirty, old-smelling caramel malt with cocoa powder and a depserate attempt at Belgian spice. Flat mouthfeel. Bland malt monster with molasses and alcohol taking over the beer. Sickening sweet finish which I guess makes this a Belgian Brown. At least that's what its advertised as. No thank you.","magictrokini","Dec 21, 2009"
3.74,3.6,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Very drinkable. At 6.3% ABV it is still very smooth and sessionable. I'll continue throwing a few of these back.","SDbeerbum","Dec 09, 2009"
3.73,3.3,3.5,3,4,4,4,"D: Another nice cask beer from Karl Strauss after having the IPA back in August '08. While I haven't been that impressed with their bottled offerings, these cask brews are quite good, glad I got to try it.","Halcyondays","Jan 16, 2009"
2.59,-28.3,3.5,2,2.5,3,3,"Taste offers some nice roasted malt flavors and a subtle hint of coffee/chocolate. Basically an average American Brown Ale.
