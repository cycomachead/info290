4.27,18,5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"M/O- The mouthfeel leans towards full bodied but it's not quite there, and the carbonation is refined and smooth.....this could qualify as a desert beer and would do well with a plum pudding or with a slice of Christmas cake or Rum cake!  It warms the senses and is quite nice on a wintery day such as the one I am reviewing this on!  It's a decent beer and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy something a little more complex!","ChrisCage","Sep 27, 2014"

3.62,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The most over-carbonated beer I've ever experienced in my life. As soon as the cap came off, this gushered like a fire hydrant at full pressure, within 10 seconds, there was only two inches of beer in the 750 ml bottle, making this the most expensive tiny half glass of beer I've ever purchased. This is the second massive gusher in three days and I'm not a happy camper. I envy the other reviewer who had no carbonation. Poured the remainder into a Gulden Draak tulip. The massive head dissipated very quickly to a ring around the glass, off-white in color. The remaining beer is a murky dark mahogany brown. Aroma of dark and sour fruit, a hint of caramel and earthy spicing. Taste is subdued, light flavor of dark and light fruit (cherries, plum and apple), sour cherry. Finishes sour with light spicing. Much closer to a saison or biere de garde than a Belgian dark ale. The spicing somewhat overwhelms the other flavors and I'd like a bit more malt for a Belgian dark. Light bodied, but nicely carbonated once it settled down. This was a miss for me.","LiquidAmber","Dec 28, 2011"

Nose of sour berries, nutmeg and other earthy spices, toasted chestnut, and a sharp acetic acid note. Flavor starts with lots of tart cherry and berries, then has some toasted nut and oak. Hints of caramel, spiced wine, and sweet-salted peanut. Medium body is lightly carbonated and watery, but finishes with a spiced wooden dryness.","CuriousMonk","Dec 10, 2011"

Aroma has a nice pleasant fruitiness with Christmas spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, and tart tropical fruit nose really makes this beer nice in the nose. Flavor is full of carbonation and a rush of cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, cardamon almost burns the palate with spice doesn't really let the base beer shine at all. Mouthfeel is super carbonated, medium bodied but the long lasting spice factor coats the palate to the point of sickening spice. Overall, the nose was nice I liked the tropical tart fruit nose, but the barrage of harsh spice really ruins this beer.","WVbeergeek","Apr 30, 2011"

Fruity yeast esters, plum, green apple, melon, chocolate, rich berry notes, cinnamon and a mild tone of oxidation. Creamy in body at first as the bubbles invade the tongue, the beer falls off the palate very quickly, a fruity, malty aftertaste is left lingering.

4.35,20.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"75cL bottle of the 2008 release. Pours a beautiful honey orange with a billowing eggshell cap and lots of sediment. Very effervescent. The foam cap is resilient, eventually dying down to a thick film while leaving sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass. Aromas of sour apples, vinegar, lemon zest, barnyard yeast, and a faint malt background blend to give it a very nice scent. The sour character is dampened on the palate, with a pleasantly sweet, slightly fruity character balancing the a bit of tartness. Again citrus comes to mind, along with some earthiness and spice. Hops are evident in the finish. I love beers like this--very complex, lots of character, and yet a low(ish) ABV.","philipquarles","Beers"
4.15,14.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Definitely good beer! I will pick this up again come next Christmas. The sourness is appetizing, and is a nice change from all of the super-malty winter beers.","pmcadamis","0"
4.04,11.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dirty looking amber/copper with a almond head that billows a good three and a half fingers tall,very carbonated(hint:pour slowly). Not an over abundance of lacing, just enough to add some nice flare. The nose smells like cider vinegar and soured pears, it burns my nose just a little, which is surprising considering the low ABV ,this is not a bad thing. A good malt backbone is accented with spice and tart fruit flavors. Wow this is super tart! Reminds me of a thin Flanders Red with lots more fruit tartness and spiciness. The body is on the light side, carbonation is on the high side, which gives a medium feel and excellent drinkability.","orangemoustache","Jan 11, 2009"
