3.34,-6.7,4.5,3.5,3,3.25,3.5,"Pours a medium-dark brown with a moderate head. Pleasant aromatic aroma with burnt sugar and vanilla notes. A pleasantly sweet malty taste with an abrupt slightly bitter finish with grapefruit notes. Certainly a well crafted Belgian dark , but the ABV borders on a Strong Dark. Although not necessarily a bad thing, a Belgian Strong Dark would have considerably more flavor to reward the consumption. American craft breweries like to push the envelope of every style, and this is no exception. If the alcohol content were lower, in the realm of a Belgian Dark Ale it would be exceptional. As a Belgian Strong Dark it is middle of the road.","wattoclone","Feb 22, 2015"

There's a lot going on in the aroma, with caramel, bready, fig, berry, and clove aromas all easily appreciable. The first two are just a little too prominent for my taste though. The flavor profile is the same story. Yes there are some fruity esters and some clove like phenols, and I even enjoy how they're balanced relative to each other (with the former shining more than the latter). The problem is how prevalent the malt character is. There's more caramel and toasty bread than anything else. The body is headed in the right direction (dry), but it's not quite light enough. Similarly, there's some life to the carbonation, but I find myself looking for even more. Still, the mouthfeel is very close to being great. Belgian Freeze is a pleasant enough brew, but it just doesn't blow me away as a Belgian Dark Ale.","axeman9182","Dec 16, 2012"

It has flavors of banana and spices, but further drinking leads to a very alcoholic lingering bitter and drying taste. All in all, I rate this passable to OK.

It's medium-full bodied, lightly zesty, and then creamy across the palate.

In flavor, prevalent is toffeeish dark candi sugar and sweet biscuit. Yeast esters are of a subdued banana bread nature. Sweetness augments as the beer breathes, and approaches maple syrup in its character, despite the high attenuation. Thinnish in mouthfeel, but this helps offset residual sweetness. Paltry in hop bitterness, but appropriately so. Trace woody hop flavor and clove phenol complement biscuit notes. Finishes with outright notes of candied almond along with creeping alcohol warmth.

The potency is mild and the aromas are easily detectable, however they just werent saying much. The palate is remarkably similar to the nose, unfortunately. The maltiness is dry, unconnected, vague sweetness, nutty as well. There is a distant trace of spiciness in the middle, alcohol too; the finish is quick with hints of chocolate, placidly bitter aftertaste. As suggested I drank this slightly warmer than normal and as it warmed significantly I still didnt taste much improvement. Medium in body with scattered carbonation, which produces a slick mouthfeel, that lacks a little bulk. It is easy to drink and pleasant enough, the name seems misleading but Im not downgrading for that, in an odd way it reminded me a lot of Shiner Winter Ale. A decent winter ale, worth trying.

The taste is quite good, with suggestions of light candi sugar, sweet yet roasty malt that dries out after swallowing, and a balanced hoppiness...not to strong yet enough to assert themselves nicely. Finishes with a bittersweet flourish, a bit better than I had expected...just let it warm a bit before pouring or drinking as I had originally had one straight from the icebox and was none too impressed, warming definately brings out the best in this beer. River Horses' best offering, IMO.","beerluvr","Oct 26, 2003"
3.65,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4," Very smooth with a pretty rich body for a River Horse product. The flavor is more intensified than others as well. Rich malts at the start combine with nice dark roasty flavors and fruits. A bit of spice aids in balancing. It really is not an in your face winter brew, but it is a good solid drinker. This is definitely their best offering, and you should give it a whirl. The smooth and creamy mouthfeel lets it just slide right down. You could easily sit down with a few. I am happy for RH for coming out with a nice beer.","ElGuapo","Beers"
3.5,-2.2,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Poured a dark brown color with some reddish hues. Relatively thin head, but it remained for a while. Some light lacing was formed on the glass during the drink. The aroma was malty with some hints of spice. The flavor was strong on the roasted malts and yeast. The spiciness was lighter than expected for a winter ale. The body was slightly thin and the carbonation was light. Tasty, but not overly exciting.","Gavage","0"
