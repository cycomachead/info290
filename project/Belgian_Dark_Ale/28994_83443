I noticed the BeerAdvocate community tends to give this style of beer a rating that never really approaches 4 for the average, but this one is pretty good for the style.","BadgerBeer","Sep 11, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice aromas and flavors for the style.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 16, 2013"

The flavor is a little white peppery with very little, if any, phenolic clovey flavors (a good thing IMO).","KevT","May 18, 2013"
