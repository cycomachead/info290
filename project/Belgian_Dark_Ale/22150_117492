3.75,7.8,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"surprised to see this rated so low, it was a very enjoyable can of beer. i think ive seen this artwork on their beer before, but i am all for recycling. i like this one, although there isnt a whole lot that i found belgian about it, even though it is listed as such. for me this was a well hopped and well carbonated drinkable dark ale that showcases the best of both a distinct hop structure and fun dark grain that doesnt bring much bitterness to the mix but gleefully provides a roasty base. the yeast was almost nondescript for me, really unadventurous and certainly lacking the belgian qualities, but i dont wish for more yeast taste here, i like the way the grain is predominant, not chocolate or burnt barley, but somewhere in that happy dark medium. the beer is also remarkably low on the tannin front, which for me here allows for a mire drinkable dark brew, less harsh and textured than others, its actually quite light in feel with fine carbonation even though the head doesnt last long. when i first got introduced to these guys, i loved everything the made. since then, i have been let down but several, but its nice to see them continue to push in new directions. i think this one is a success, and maybe judged a little harshly on here.","StonedTrippin","Dec 13, 2014"

3.95,13.5,,,,,,"Notes: Black in color beneath a deep tan head. Excellent head retention. Very good lacing. Aroma of soft roastiness and dark chocolate. The flavor follows suit with a bit more depth, including notes of chickory, nuts (I'm thinking mainly filberts and a little bit of peanut), medium caramel, and grain. There's also a touch of plain sugar to it, mainly found in the finish. No noticeable yeast character except that it's very subtly fruity with a touch of red berry. The bitterness is moderate, and there's just a light touch of dark malt acidity. Some lightly floral, grassy, and leafy hops come through, mainly at the swallow and into the gently lingering finish. It's nice that the roastiness is kept in check, leaving it round and smooth. Pleasant, and quaffable.","NeroFiddled","Aug 22, 2014"

Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, pear, apple, anise, pepper, clove, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, light coffee, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/roasted malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of raisin, pear, apple, anise, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, light coffee, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, pear, apple, anise, chocolate, cocoa, roast, toast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant Belgian dark ale. Good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

Creamy and quite dry, which helps with the drinkability. This is not a Saison and I don't see it marketed as such anywhere, so I'm rating this as an easy-going "black ale" with a slight Belgian twist.

Aromas of slight roasted malts and some kind of yeasty breadiness. Also faint hints of coffee as it warms. The taste is the weak point in the beer sadly, there isn't much that pop out in this beer, it's definitely more of a easy to drink sessionable dark ale than a porter or a black i.p.a. - pretty similar to a black lager, very light bodied mouth feel. I wish there was more flavor to this one! trying to let it warm up a bit to see if that helps like it normally does...nope not really :(","Beerlover","Apr 20, 2014"

Nothing really stood out about this one. It was light in body, but also in flavor. The mouthfeel was the overall highlight.","ZombiesAteMyDog","0"
