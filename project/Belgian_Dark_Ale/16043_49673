4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"WOW! this is the perfect example of a beer whose total is greater than the sum of its parts. Incredibly balance of fruit, both high and low. The low individual rating do it no justice, but I can't give it a 5 as an overall to balance its real value. shame.","OF001","Sep 28, 2012"
3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A decent strong Belgian-styled dark ale, the fruitiness well rendered, and weirdly balanced, even though there seems to be little present in the way of natural offsets. Anyway, this is rather agreeable, and nicely warming - in my veins, as opposed to in my gullet, always a plus.","biboergosum","May 29, 2012"
3.59,-6.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Ok beer but a slight let down, something’s not quite doing it for me. Perhaps one of the more expensive brews in my Advent Calendar and with it not bringing up the average it’s a little disappointing","wordemupg","May 21, 2012"
3.89,1.3,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Interesting beer. Poured perhaps a touch cold, with a small to medium sized, cream-colored head that soon settles to some swirls and a ring with a tiny bit of lace. Color is a cloudy brown amber opaque in the wider parts of the glass. Aroma is a muted combo of malt, fruit, apricots, plums, yeast, wine. Flavor is a blend of those qualities with interesting interplay between sweet and carbonic tang being slightly more dominant than bitter. Very rich. Body is big, but the sweet, tang and bitter create high points that along with its richness make it a little overpowering. Carbonation is good taken alone. Finish is medium in length. No alcohol warmth. One and done.","drpimento","May 19, 2012"

4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - For a strong, borderline sour Belgianish beer, this is surprisingly drinkable. The fruit and light sourness go well together while the sugar keeps it balanced and prevents the tartness from dominating.","nickfl","Jun 26, 2011"

4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured out as a hazy brown color with a nice light tan head. As the head settles the lacing sticks really well to the glass. The smell of some sweet dark fruits and a bit of yeast on the nose. The taste is lightly toasted with some dark fruity flavors. The flavors are very good in the beer. The mouthfeel isn't overly heavy and has a pretty good carbonation. Overall I really liked this beer quite a bit.","Knapp85","May 02, 2011"
3.8,-1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O: The beer is very easy to drink because it isn’t as full bodied compared to other beers in the style.","metter98","Jan 19, 2011"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a brownish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee and caramel malts. The flavor is similar with a little bit of citrus to go with the toffee. There is also some brown sugar in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","May 31, 2010"
3.65,-4.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very malty aroma and flavor, raisons and other dark fruits. A little bit pricey but worth it.","david18","May 07, 2010"
3.83,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy light amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet caramel malt with huge caramel malt presence with just the right amount of residual sugar. Taste is also a strange mix between some caramel malt with a right balance of residual sugar with a light hoppy finish and some dry figs and plums notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Hard to categorize but well worth drinking.","Phyl21ca","May 06, 2010"

3.62,-5.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"More of a dark amber colored beer, leaning into brown territory. The head doesn't stay up very long, but granted I was drinking from a 5.5 ounce glass. An interesting beer. I get a little plum and some aspects that I'd find in the sauce of Kung Pao Chicken. Taste is interesting as well. There's the plum again, but it's light, and there's also some roastiness going on, like a Belgian Dark/Stout mix. Body is on the lighter side, which was a little surprising. Worth a go? Sure, give it a chance.","DoubleJ","Beers"
3.43,-10.7,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a brownish-amber brew, the head is thick and densely packed. The aroma has a distinctly smoky malt scent, complete with a little toast, some yeast, and a lot of spicy peppery smells. Plenty of tobacco aromas. The taste is semi-sweet, with a caramel and yeast flavor. There's a variety of malt flavors, from pale to some moderately-heavy roast tastes. The finish is a little abrupt. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. This is a decently drinkable beer, but nothing that I'd go out my way for.","Suds","0"
