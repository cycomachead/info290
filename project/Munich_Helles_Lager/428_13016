The beer had a good aroma to it, sweet malt with a hint of lemon and spice. The taste of the beer was just as good, if not better, and exactly what I would think of for this style. Nice balance with just a slight edge to the malt and still with that hint of lemon. The beer had a light body to it. The beer was clean, crisp smooth and extremely easy to drink. I could drink this all of the time.","PhillyStyle","Dec 08, 2013"

I would gladly try again if found somewhere cheaper (paid $5.49 for this 500 ml bottle - not worth it at all), but in the end, there are many better (and cheaper) Helles lagers.

With a slight crispness and light-medium body which helps make this beer very refreshing, this is one of many candidates for the stereotypical helles lager.","DoubleJ","May 09, 2013"

It was very, very smooth - almost too smooth! A little more crispiness would have been cool, but I liked it for what it was just fine. Why did the glass have to be 14oz?

It smells like it. Sharp bubbles hit first in the taste, followed by some sweetness that remains unidentifiable (more corn? molasses?), some easily identifiable malt and finally a bite from the hops that is bitter but refreshing.

There's the appropriate hint of sulfur in the aroma with light bread crust. This is a true German lager. It doesn't have the most unique or compelling flavor, but it's super drinkable and tasty.

It's a light beer with a mild malty feel and a sharp hop content. It goes down easy with some residual maltiness, but finishes bitter and grassy. It's got a fruity nature, but seems to be a little too hoppy. The malts in the aroma are not as pronounced in flavor. The mouthfeel is decent as well.

4.1,3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It's tough to tell how this one is really different from the Mahr's Bock Bier I had a couple nights ago. The main difference I think is that this is an overall lighter beer, though it shares many of the same qualities, starting with the appearance. This beer is a light orange to darkish straw yellow with a nice head, though it doesn't last long, and nice crisp clarity. Smell and taste are full of wet grains, sawdust, and a lightly sweet malt backbone. Tones of honey (I find this in almost all the Mahr's beers), and a nice crisp and spicy hop profile. I think the bock bier has a higher abv and therefore is a little spicier and sharp, while this beer is nothing but soft on the palate and uber drinkable.

Yummy with a hint of tettnanger hops. Taste...rounded rough malt mixes well with the tettnanger hops (which I consider taste a bit dirty and edgy). Just a touch of caramel. The beer is honey-ish sweet...not wet, not dry, but right in between. Hop bitter is minimal, but there is a bit of a grassy edge. This beer is a quality product that is representative of the flavor and quality of beers I had fresh on tap while in German a while back. Md-light body and mid-range carbonation.

4.03,1.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Half-liter bottle, bottled on 6-10-2003. Pours a pale straw pils color with a fair eggshell colored head. Modest malty nose with a hint of fresh hops. Very refreshing, smooth and clean tasting. Mild in its malt/hop balance, and softly mineral in the water content. Assumes a slightly citrus astringency in the malt, like it was oversparged. Just enough hops to provide a counterbalnce for the malt and provide a crisp finish. I like this Helles, I'd seek it out again. Very enjoyable.","crookedhalo","Sep 02, 2004"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at Redbones...This beer was served slightly cloudy, but not opaque, a chamomile tea color. Nice light sweet smell. I was very pleasantly surprised with this one: it had the nice flowery hop characteristic that I enjoy so much, with some light sweet malt in the background. If you enjoy a solid german helles, with a flowery hop finish, then you will enjoy this beer. Not as refined a brew as the Burgerbrau version, but definitely very enjoyable. Prost! pat","PatandDavid","Sep 28, 2003"
