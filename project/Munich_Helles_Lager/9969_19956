It was a good pour so it had a large head to whittled down to a broken film. Light carb and tiny bit of lacing. The aroma was so-so. Kinda funky, skunked smell at first then it faded to not much of anything. The taste was OK with a crisp finish. I'm not a huge fan of the style so it wouldn't get great marks to begin with but this is middle of the road for the style. As it warms, the flavor starts to get a weird tang to it so drink cold. If it had a better taste, it could almost sneak into session beer territory but just misses. Overall, it's an OK beer but with so many other good beers out there I don't see me buying another unless it was a choice between Macro and this.

3.62,8.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The yellow-gold body of Rahr's helles is just slightly cloudy beneath it's short but creamy head of bright white foam. The retention is average, and lacing is limited. In the nose it's gently yeasty over a firm maltiness that's just lightly grainy and subtly sweetish, and backed by floral and grassy hop notes. The flavor continues in the same vein, and it's nicely balanced between gently grainy and subtly husky malt and grassy and floral hops. It's delicately sweet, balanced by a firm bitterness, and it finishes honeyish with an edge of mineralish and grassy hops that linger shortly on the palate. Enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 09, 2006"

The aroma consists of a mild, clean grainy sweetness with a touch of herbal hop. The taste consists of a mildly bready malt body with grain flavors becoming a force towards the middle of a sip. The overall sweetness factor is a little high, but not out of control. A touch of German hops gives this more character. Stylistically speaking, this beer seems like it fits somewhere between a very good all-malt lager and a helles. Anyway, this is an excellent session choice.","Gagnonsux","Oct 19, 2005"

In fact, its hard to think of many superior choices than this to help battle the Texas summer.","Morris729","Apr 17, 2005"
4.08,22.5,4,3.5,4,4,5,"There's one inch of dense, clean, white foam. Nice. Beer is very clear, pure gold, and sports some racy-fast carbonation. Some smooth, small shapes of lacing. The nose is nice, schpooncky Saaz, fruity, crackers, a little soap. Saazy, peppery front. Full, foamy middle, with a touch of corn and tangy fruit. Finish is quite bitter, some fantastic grains. Nice, nutty, fresh. The slight harshness of the finish tames with temperature. Overall, a really good helles. Love the grains!","kbub6f","Mar 05, 2005"

3.44,3.3,3.5,2,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a nice yellow color with a 2 finger head that stays nicely over the beer. The nose is pretty unpleasant. Lots of skunked business going on. I don't like it. The flavor is very grassey, with a rather big noble hop that fades quickly to more grassey flavors. The feel is the light side of moderate. Overall, the nose really offends. The flavor is much better than the nose. I would like this one in the summer. Not bad at all.","kmpitz2","Jan 26, 2005"
3.53,6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a medium gold color with a proud 1/2" of creamy white head. Smell is of grassy and grainy malt, no trace of hops. Taste is very grassy, stands up with any euro lager, hops are in the background, light and floral, with some metallic flavors. Mouthfeel is full and well carbonated, and this would make a good sessioning beer. Thanks again to assurbanipaul.","TastyTaste","Dec 28, 2004"
4.04,21.3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A nice Helles, which is a style hard to judge because even the best examples have subtle flavors. It's not an exciting or bold style, but when done well, like this Rahr beer, it's very pleasant and quite drinkable.","allengarvin","Dec 06, 2004"
3.54,6.3,5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is a very nice session beer. It could stand more maltiness in the aroma and taste. Maybe a little too hoppy to be a traditional Helles but quite drinkable.","LarryKemp","Sep 25, 2004"
4.2,26.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The aroma is sweet and malty although not overpowering at any level. The real surprise here is the taste. This is a very flavorful beer...not too sweet but with enough malty goodness to blend effortlessly with the faint hops. This is one that could become a session beer for me.","kindestcut","Sep 20, 2004"
3.63,9,3.5,3,4,3,4,"Overall Impression: A refreshing brew. It was in the neighborhood of an American Macro Lager in flavor, but enough taste to keep me interested. Enjoyed on tap at the Flying Saucer: Ft. Worth after a few palate wreckers, so my review is probably a bit off. Ill look forward to trying a more mature brew, but a promising start for a Texas brewery!","HardTarget","Beers"
3.76,12.9,4,3,4,3,4.5,"Edit, 12/28/2004: Resampled from bottle, ratings upgraded slightly. Better head retention, white and frothy, cleaner aroma but still mild. Very light and attractive sitting in a glass with very fine carbonation.","assurbanipaul","0"
