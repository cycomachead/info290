4.13,1.7,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"16.9 oz bottle poured into a stein. Light gold color, excellent clarity, and a creamy white head that leaves behind spotty lacing. Sweet malts in the aroma with a touch of spice from the hops. Clean and malty in the flavor as well but great balance with the hops. Medium bodied, full of flavor, and ridiculously easy to drink. Soft carbonation bubbles rise to the surface throughout the beer. A classic Helles lager, one of the best I've had to date.","Jacobob10","Thursday at 10:48 AM"

4.1,1,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had everything that I look for in a German made Lager and there wasn't any aspects that felt out of place.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, slightly prickly, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these without getting tired of it.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had everything that I expect from a good German made Lager.  What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys a good Lager.  All in all I was happy with this beer,it was just a well crafted lager and I enjoyed it.  This is up there as one of the better beers I've had from this brewery and I think it's now my favorite German made Lager.  Good job guys, this was one good Lager, Keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Sep 14, 2014"

However, I just don't get how this beer is so highly rated. As the previous reviewer stated it has a skunky smell, much like Heineken and doesn't taste much better either. Maybe my palate isn't advanced enough to taste all the flavors people claim they pick up in this one, yet it just tasted blah. In fact I would turn it down offered it again. Do yourself a favor, if you just have to try this beer because you figure it must be good cause they have been brewing it for like 1000 years and their hefe is so fantastic, then only buy a single. Yet even that I would caution against.","Melikeydahop","May 06, 2014"

Anyway, following what VDubb referred to as a perfect pour, this stuff looks pretty solid, a clear brassy gold topped by about two fingers or so of white foam. The nose comprises hard water, straight grains, noble hops, grass, flowers, and light wild rice. The taste brings in more of the same, the noble hops shining against a backdrop of mineral-laden grains. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn tasty and extremely easy-to-drink beer.

A little too much carbonation, taste isn't the best and strange sweet aftertaste that is stuck to your palette. Overall its not the worst, but too sweet, and carbonated, reminds me of a "grain soda."","vette2006c5r","Oct 11, 2013"

3.8,-6.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a slightly hazy lightly-pinkish yellow, much like slightly cloudy piss. The head is massive and beautifully stark white, with a creamy tight texture and tinny little bubbles. Carbonation appears moderate in the body of the beer, which is the faintest bit hazy, but truthfully quite clear. Lacing is in thin sticky sheets that run little lines across the glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and spicy, much like a Czech pilsner. Sweet sticky grain malt mixes with spicy grassy hops to tantalize the nose with varying layers. Slight caramel and biscuit can also be detected in the malt, and faint citrus plays alongside the spices. The beer tastes wonderfully bready with light spices from the hops. On the opening sip the spices tingle slightly at the beginning alongside a steadily growing bready flavor which eventually explodes in the middle of the taste, drowning out the hops momentarily with its creamy biscuit qualities before mellowing light citrus and hay with spicy zest and a faint lingering taste of biscuit. On the tongue, the beer is crisp and bubbly, though not too much so. The beers holds properly thin and drinkable in the mouth and it leaves the mouth quite clean with light droplets of saliva on the tongue. Overall the beer is quite refreshing and drinkable, with some nice malty complexity, although I do wish more of the spicy hops were able to transfer over from the smell to the flavor. A terrific Munich Helles with some nice flavor to rest alongside the easy drinkability, and a great start to my Weihenstephan experience.","Maxwell","Dec 02, 2012"

It is a fizzy yellow beer, yes, but it German lagers are the paradigms of all fizzy yellow beers, and this one still has a nice, creamy head and light lacing down the glass that belies a beer with much more class and style than Americans expect from fizzy yellow beers. If all your friends could be exemplified in fizzy yellow beers, then the helles lager is your well-dressed European friend who's a very nice guy and tends to pick up surprisingly attractive women. And it smells like the south of Germany. It smells like a great vacation. It smells like summertime.","porntipsguzzardo","Jun 07, 2012"

The taste is pretty good also very crisp and slightly dry, it has some grainy malts up front with a nice hop balance.

It has nice pale malty sweetness with a touch of honey and an ever so slight, dry and hoppy finish. The finish is nice and smooth and overall refreshing. The flavor reminds me of fresh a Hofbrau Munich Helles from the Hofbrau House. This bottle drinks exceptionally fresh and crisp. This is a top notch beer for the style and a great beer for a hot day.

Nose had a pleasant grassy, Saaz hops odor underlain by a biscuit maltiness. My mouth began to water in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium with a clean, lightly grassy bitterness on the tongue. I really love drinking adjunct-free lager, especially after so many AALs on The CANQuest (TM). My FerMentor, Lew Bryson, has described lagers as the equvalent of frozen tundra with nothing to hide behind. That would sum up this beer. It was slightly dry on the finish, refreshing and very pleasant. Now, if they would just put it in a CAN ...","woodychandler","Jul 17, 2011"

A grainy aroma, reminiscent of white toast, jumps out amidst a light sweet malt base with an essence of shrubby noble hops. Very inviting. With a quite malt-forward taste, it drinks creamy smooth and decidedly full-bodied for the style - cereal grains with a touch of honey sweetness highlight what's essentially a uber-malty pilsner flavor. Brawny and hearty, surprisingly filling yet refreshing.","Bouleboubier","Jan 30, 2011"

This pours a mildly cloudy golden color with a tall white head that has good retention. Carbonation is visible floating up through my glass. The smell is as potent as other beers, but this beer still smells delightful. I caught a whiff of sweet grain, a little bit of apple or citrus as well as some hops. The fruity smell is less emphasized in the taste as what really comes through strong is the well balanced hop and malt blend. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and drinkability is off the charts. Another near-perfect creation from Weihenstephaner.","gkunkle","Dec 17, 2010"

It has a light pilsner malt flavor that goes down easy and lays a solid foundation for an excellent hop bitterness and flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It's and easy drinking with good hop character.","WesWes","Dec 10, 2010"

Light, grassy hops provide restraint to the sweetness and refreshment to the palate. Finishes mostly clean with a light sweetness lingering.

Grainy sweetness, a bit crackery, with light lemony bitterness and grassy hops throughout. Slightly spicy in the finish. Delicious. Light bodied with ample carbonation, some crispness and dryness.

That old law of 1517 was enacted on behalf of German bakers concerned about competition from brewers for wheat. Like many half-baked laws in societies the world over, why they didn't just pass a law saying "wheat is for bread, not beer" we may never know. Since then, it's morphed grotesquely into a purity law. Thankfully, German brewers managed to make good beer in spite of the law. Readers of this site probably know that the law was officially repealed in 1987. Weihenstephaner's "original premium" has a crisp, clean and light-bodied great taste. It pours light golden with a foamy white head. It's aroma and taste are good clean malt and mild hop. Drinkers of the beer axis of evil (you know the giants) should give this style and this brand a try. It's a very refreshing, every day kind of beer that can satisfy those afraid of the dark, but with enough complexity for people who find little interest in cars that only turn left.","wrightst","Mar 29, 2010"

Grading apples to apples, German beer should have a little more flavor. But it goes down extra smooth. You can chug this beer, but should a German beer be like that? Notably, it's the world's oldest brewery, though that is likely misleading since it is likely not made the same way as in the year 1040. It's more likely a marketing ploy.

Tastes were similar to aromas - lemon, pale malt, slight dried grass and a hint of hop.

Nice nibble from the hops, ever so gentle. Somewhat grassy, leafy hop presence and a splash of lemon zest. Some biscuity bread is also present.

Extremely hoppy and grassy, with some lemon piercing through on top of something sugary. A great hop presence is noticeable and there are some spices that hit the tip of the tongue. A medium-bodied beer that goes down smoothly but with a nice, dry aftertaste. There are some bread malts or something in there, plus there may have been some light fruitiness and sweetness, i.e. apples and honey.

On the palate, it comes through first sweet then hits the side of the mouth with a dry tartness. Hop bitterness is totally in check with the light toasty flavors of the pils malts and a little apple fruitiness from the yeast.

This beer opens with a hop-dominant nose of Noble hops, releasing a boquet of earthy, grassy, herbal notes. A sturdy backbone of pilsner malts offer support for the hops, while offering little in terms of sweetness or graininess. Any pilsner-type dms or acetaldahyde are swallowed by the hops. Delicate malt textures bleed well into the dryness of the hops and mild alcohols. Finishes light, crisp, and with a lingering hop flavor.

The taste is nice, I will say that though I feel that this is a good beer, I think it is probably the last favorite that I have tried from Weihenstephan.

But I really didn't appreciate how good until years later, drinking it again as an experienced (IMHO) BA. The color is nice, somewhat cloudy pale yellow; with a fresh, subtle malt/hops in the nose. Thinner mouthfeel, but very nice taste that balances the pale malt flavor with a distinctly fruity or citrus (?) hops flavor that makes it extremely refreshing to drink. According to a German wine lover I know, the taste is reminiscent (if subtlely so) of a crisp German Riesling Kabinett. Very good--and something that I've served to BAs and "macro" lovers alike, with equal rave reviews. Truly a universally popular German helles.","tugdriver7","Apr 12, 2007"

Nearly one thousand years ago it was the monastery brewery of the Benedictine monks, then the Royal Bavarian State Brewery. Today, as a regulated enterprise of the Freestate of Bavaria, it is a company run according to the precepts of private business. As the oldest existing brewery in the world, our brewery occupies an exalted site atop Weihenstephan Hill in the Bavarian city of Freising, surrounded by the comparatively still very young Weihenstephan science centre of the Technical University of Munich.

The mouthfeel is crisp and prickly from a fair amount of carbonation. It goes down easy so it's fairly drinkable. A very nice, crisp lager that goes down very easily.","Hagbard","Dec 22, 2005"

This last point may have led to the comparison - I can't remember what it's like to have fresher than the one I just had, but in any case, this and Breznak are in the same beer category in my book. In fact, I bought this thinking it was the Hefeweißbier (which I really felt like) but didn't read the label properly and realised upon the first sip (and spurious clarity) that it wasn't a Weissbier at all. And to think, I broke one of my good Weizen glasses while getting it out, and I wasn't even having a Weissbier after all!

This brew pours a pale gold with a scant brilliant white head. The aroma is a wonderful amalgam of herbal and spicy hops (Hallertau on parade!!), grain, and some light malt. Balance is the hallmark of this brew. Herbal hops, simple sugar maltiness and a slight breadiness are combined beautifully. Spot on for style...any maltier and it'd be a Dortmunder, any hoppier a Pilsener. Sign me up for a keg! Prosit!","johnrobe","Feb 08, 2004"

Taste: Good carbonation, just-right body, kept from over-sweetness by some citrus hop bite, biscuit malt and perfect yeast. Oh, my gosh! Where has this beer been? The finish features a light, perfectly dry, silk-glove slap from alcohol and a lingering hoppy finish. Did I mention this is the best Lager I have ever tasted? Why has no liquor store I have ever been in not featured this beer? And only $2.69 for 1 pint, .9 oz.! Around $7 for a sixpack. If you havent tried it  go find some now!","palliko","Jan 13, 2004"

This beer is so clean and refreshing, no trace of skunk. Pours a relatively ordinary looking, pale glass of beer. Smaller, foamy head, which dissapates rather quickly. Refreshing, almost flowery smell and taste. This may be the "softest" beer I've ever had. To me, this is the kind of beer that would have a shot at converting some of the masses if they ever tried it. Just as refreshing as an American lager or even a wheat beer, not bitter at all.

Begins with a somewhat sweet cracker-like malt flavor, which is balanced nicely by the spicy herbal hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp.

Front is lightly sweet, the top wraithish, finish minimally acidic, the hops apropos for the style, droughty aftertaste that lingers on.

4.77,17.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Clear, golden in color, with a bright white head that dies quickly. It does maintain a nice collar throughout the glass but the surface retains only whisps of foam. Outstanding aroma of bright, fresh, grainy, malty sweetness and a slightly herbal note, but without any distinct hops. The body is solidly medium and the carbonation level is moderate. The mouthfeel is crisp on the front of the tongue and filling at the back of the mouth. Starts with a bold malt note up-front - void of any hop character - that widens as it crosses the palate, then slowly reveals the presence of a gentle hop flavor. It finishes quickly at first, but creeps back in with a strong malt character and light hoppiness throughout the mouth . An interesting balancing act! A very distinct and unique beer brewed just outside of Munich. I see it as a strong version of a Munich helles rather than a Dortmunder-style export as the emphasis is on malt. It doesn't have the crispness of the Dortmunder beers. Still, one could argue it both ways. Exceptional!","NeroFiddled","Aug 14, 2002"

Soft grainy malt notes, with a mellow, well rounded sweetness in aroma.  The hop nose is mild, but green and herbal Hersbrucker is perceptible. Grainy, light bread and butter - like notes comprise the initial malt flavors, and residual pleasant and well calculated sweetness follows.  The hop bitterness is quite low, yet it provides enough foundation to prevent overbearing sweetness. This brew finishes expectedly sweet, but hop bitterness and lightly toasty Vienna malt emerge on the back on the tongue.  Weihenstephaner Original is a superbly balanced brew, and is a definitive example of the style.","marc77","Jun 16, 2002"
