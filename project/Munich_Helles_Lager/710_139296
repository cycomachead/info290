It is a departure from the style in the smell and taste.  It is ALMOST in the IPL territory.  Floral notes on top of a helles body.  worth a try.","Uniobrew31","Feb 07, 2015"

4.1,20.2,,,,,,"Beer #500!  Helles Yeah. Part of a great sampler pack found at the local supermercado, containing actually four brews of which I have tried none! That said let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice sweet noble hop waft with a malt base.  Pours to a bright pee yellow with a pillow top white foam head that recedes slowly and clings.  Taste is a nice shot of honey up front with a balanced but slightly more bitter mix of sweet malt and hops that is natural and very grassy.  Finish is a light sweetness with a quickly fading bitterness that leaves a clean palate.  A tasty brew, great for hot weather.","mooseisloose","Dec 03, 2014"
