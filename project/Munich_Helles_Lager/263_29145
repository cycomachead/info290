Compared to the original "Aecht Schlenkerla" this is the best solution because you will be able to enjoy a toned down smoke flavor with a not so heavy beer. It is unfortunate that it costs me $5.99/bottle here in San Francisco, whereas it costs $1 in Germany.","bentpages","Jul 29, 2014"

Rich sweet caramelized pilsner malt dominates the aroma. Rich dried fruit, prunes and raisins come to mind. Non existent hop aroma. Lightly spicy and almost smokey component shows up in the aroma as well. The flavor is rich with lots of caramelized sugary maltiness and plenty of dark dried fruits. There is a hint of herbal hop flavor and a bit of sweet cardboard. Medium body with a fairly dry finish. Moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Love the aroma here, but the flavor suggests this bottle my be less than fresh.

Aroma has a subtle smoke character with hints of smoked meats and a light biscuit malt grain character. Flavor has an interesting smoked nuttiness to it adds great complexity to a light classic well executed German helles. Kind of a one note flavor but a very interesting and tasty one note, makes me wish I had another bottle or two. Mouthfeel is evenly carbonated with a light but not watery body.

The nose brings a good amount of smoke along with mild lager characteristics lingering in the background. The smoke definitely overwhelms the lager, which which basically just means a lightly-smoked carbonated beverage. This creates problems for both the nose and the taste.

Nice golden, straw colored body with lots of carbonation contributing to the two-finger, off-white, foamy head. My nose is picking up smoke only. It's more than the predominant smell here. The taste is a different story. Contrary to what I remember about the Marzen, the smokiness sits back a little and though, while ever present, lets the malts do more talking. There's a fine carbonation to this beer with medium body, it's excellent. I wish I weren't on a budget, because I'd order another.

The hops are a little weak but noticable in the finish. Cereal grains in the aftertaste. Bitterness is low. Light body with abundant carbonation that stops short of being harsh.

This was a lighter bodied beer, decent carbonation, not filling at all. The taste lessens the drinkability on this beer. I was really disappointed with the overbiscuity, smoked flavor.

That leaves the helles part, and I'd say that was pretty distant, too, when compared to something like a Weihenstephan helles.

Beside that the beer is a light but pleasant Helles with moderate bitterness and is quite clean and a bit of a sweet light malt tang. Smooth and crisp and the smoke really blends beautifully.

I was surprised to read on the website that there is actually no smoked malt in this beer, but it's fermented in the same vessels in which they make their Marzenbiers, which gives it that smoky infusion.

4.33,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I love this beer. I had this for the first time at a tasting with my beer rep at the bar I used to work for. Drinking this beer made me nervous at first seeing as Rauchbier is a once in a while indulgence for me. What a surprise though - poured into a willybacher this beer was a pale straw color with superior clarity (which for some reason I did not expect being as this is a Schlenkerla brew) with a rocky head. The aroma is of spicy hops, sweet bready malt and of course smoke -but much less smoke aroma than I get from the Schlenkerla Rauchbiers. Because this is not listed as a rauchbeir on the label I was torn as to what I should think about the smoke aroma. The mouthfeel is light clean and dry with a light carbonation. The first sip is outstanding - well-balanced malt, very crisp and dry, hops don't come in until the finish and are coupled with a very subtle, very flavorful and oddly refreshing smoke tinge. Who really brewed this? Clearly not Heller-Trum whos other beers are sooo very smokey and intensely robust. The smokiness is so subdued and complimentary to the rest of the beer's flavor profile, that I can hardly believe it's not an added synthetic flavor. Each sip and the smokiness becomes less and less pronounced as my palate grows accustomed. I ended up ordering a case of this and drank half of it myself. Recently I caught up with the local guy who works for the importer and he tells me the brewery uses absolutely NO smoked malt. Apparently they just pass unsmoked malt through the same gristmill as the smoked malt and this adds enough smokey starches to the brew. He also mentioned they use the same yeast strain as the authentic Rauchbier and so these yeast may be passing on smoke flavors from batches past. Either way this is an incredible Helles and very worth your attention, and the attention of your next cheeseburger.","miskatonic","Aug 14, 2006"

Taste is great; smoke and wood notes combine with full maltiness and grain and a touch of hoppy bite. Some grassy elements as well. Very nice. Mouthfeel is rich, yet not overpowering or thick.

I couldnt get any hop aroma through the smoke. The taste, like the smell, is pinned to the smokiness. Theres also a soft and round malt quality. Finishes with just a touch of bitterness for balance. The beer is semi-dry, with a soft, lingering finish.

Anyway, it pours into the pilsner glass a clear yellow/gold with a 1 finger head that reduces to a thick and creamy layer of foam that sticks quite well. The aroma consists of toasty, pale malts with a faint smokiness and a mild dose of spicy hops.

The smoke flavor doesn't get in the way at all; this beer remains highly drinkable, albeit with a smokey twist that increases its element of interest and/or mystery. Very interesting beer.","geexploitation","Apr 01, 2006"

4.08,3.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The smell is essentially malty, with light roasted notes, a bit like roasted corn. Sweet with some burnt caramel. The taste gets quite enjoyable: a good lager, showing a round and smooth maltiness, combined with interesting notes of smoke. Some sweet fruitiness too, citrus, some orange peel, hints of lemon, with a light dry hoppy grapefruity finish. Well balanced, a more than decent brew by Schlenkerla.","tjd25","Sep 28, 2003"

3.42,-13.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Nobbad, quite enjoyed it. Lightly smoked, bacon flavour, dry-ish, slightly herbal hops finish, a bit salty aswell. Not as heavily smoky as there other beers, which on one hand makes it easier to drink, but on the other hand its less flavourfull and less complex. I think i prefer the Marzen a lot more.(Draught- GBBF 03')","rastaman","0"
