4.17,24.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours golden with a large, white head. A finger length of head is left after the head dissipates. A moderate amount of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of bready and grainy and there is a mild floral scent. It's a pretty basic, but appealing scent. The taste follows the nose. The malts bring a nice bready and grainy flavor to the beer. There are some hops in the background which help balance the flavor of the beer. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer that I would drink again.","acevenom","Jul 08, 2012"

4.32,29.3,4.5,5,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured out with a nice thick white and fluffy head and is very bubbly. Its body is a nice dark golden blonde and is pretty hazy with some mild carbonation. Its aroma is very citrusy; smells of orange, lemon and peach come through along with some wheat. This beer has some very good lacing! Its light and semi crisp on the tongue with an overall grainy flavor to it. There are some tart flavors when it hits the corners of your mouth and a slight malty aftertaste. Overall, this beer is very tasty, I look forwarding to drinking this one again.","vickersspitfire","0"
