3.48,5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"I had yet to encounter this one on tap in this city, so figured I'd take the plunge and enjoy a 20 oz. pint. This style is a bit of a rarity when it comes to what western Canadian micros usually tackle and as an unabashed Lowenbrau fan I was intrigued. A pleasant goldenrod brassy color with a few white bubbles, this brew smells like good old prairie pilsener malt with a moderate dose of noble hop green spiciness. Popcorn and cracker malts and a little toast buttress some sour green fruit (gooseberry?) and crabapple notes, some cooked corn DMS flavor, and a little green vegetation from the hops. Not particularly assertive in the latter regard, however. Is that diacetyl as well? This one is quite sweet and sour in the finish, with a fair degree of carbonation. The final assessment? This actually reminds me a bit of a kolsch or even certain Czech pilseners in terms of the malt flavor profile and the presence of subtle fruit flavors that yield a rather cidery character. Still falls within style guidelines I suppose. I prefer the European examples I have tried.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 14, 2013"

Well balanced, nothing special but my favorite session beer.","BigBry","Beers"
3.9,18.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"1516 is a typical, but healthy and attractive looking pale lager. Light browns and golden straw, light honey colours. The head is definitely better than average, however. It poured with a perfect amount of head, neither overdone nor underdone. Off-white, thick, but fairly ephemeral, as it dissipates to a thin layer, the lace leaving thin serpentine patches. On a sweltering day, the appearance screams "drink me." The aroma is grainy, lightly toasted, with subtle tart milkiness like so many German lagers. Hops are well balanced, with some delicate spiciness and grass. Again, very German aroma, fittingly enough. The taste is brisk, refreshing, and thirst quenching. Good caramel malt up front, with a definite hop burst on the finish, leaving the mouth with a balanced, not overly sweet or dry feel. The freshness of the toasted malt is superb in this beer, roasted to perfection, a true credit to barley. Light butterscotch and even subtle lemon in the taste. The mouthfeel is high carbonation, light to medium bodied, and invigoratingly quenching. The drinkability, being neither offensive, strong, or heavy, is very good: an ideal summer brew; not to indicate, however, that this has little taste--on the contrary it is very flavourful. This is one beer I buy quite consistently; if I go out to buy a "six-pack" for a hot summer day, this usually is the standard. A credit to its name, 1516 is a natural refreshing German-style lager.","Cwrw","0"

Has a crisp hay/malt smell to it, light flowery hops rounding it off. Flavour is the light average of a crisp lager, a decent balance and it goes down smooth. However not much else going on to make it stand out either. This is a decent enough lager, I'd buy it again for another patio/barbecuing session, especially in mixed company (macro drinkers, non-beer drinkers, and beer snobs alike) but I'd reserve it for hot weather refreshment, by no means would I make it a standard of mine. Still, I'd buy this hands down over any macro on the market.","IronDjinn","0"
