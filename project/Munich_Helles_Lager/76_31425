My opinion of this beer, as with so many, has evolved with each serving. To my mind, this one gets it right as a wonderful compromise between flavor and body. The grassy and herbal hop presence is undeniable yet not to the point of histrionics, while the malts provide firm nutritional and textural support and even approach oktoberfest levels yet without the likelihood of Maillard fatigue. Maybe a little more aromatics would be nice, at least as a first impression booster, but in the end they would be irrelevant and possibly even an unwelcome distraction. I will be rushing out soon to find another fresh 6 or 12-pack.","brewmudgeon","Jul 18, 2014"

A fresh smell that I can't quite place me. The taste reminds me of a Czech lager, nothing to any extreme but all very crispy and clean.

Head eventually settles into a broken skim; one delicate band of lacing was formed during the tasting. Mild nose - cereal malts, a hint of sweetness as a result, and a suggestion of citrus and skunk.

Grassy hop aromas and a touch of bready malts emanate from this brew. Additionally, if I swirl the glass and bring the beer quickly to my nose, I get a pleasing aroma of jasmine rice which is quite unique and very inviting. Flavour is grassy up front with a bread backbone, a slight touch of alcohol and some very light caramel notes with a touch of grain and light fruit (I get a bit of grape - no, wait, I think it's the jasmine rice I detected before! cool! I could be crazy, but I don't think so.) on the finish. A nice, crisp breadiness lingers on for a good while. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a subtle spicy, prickly character that cleans the palate an leaves a nice and dry sensation in my mouth. This is a pretty good helles lager that is highly drinkable and quite refreshing - an ideal summer lager. Nice and light (but not too light!) and more flavourful than your typical macro.

3.45,-6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Taste is very malty and chewy, notes of munich and crystal malts make the beer very heavy. A nice bitterness, which is clean and balances the malt. Body is actually quite thin for it's malty taste. Yeast leaves little taste, just the bottom fermented tastes.","Absumaster","Jun 17, 2008"
3.47,-5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- The after taste makes it hard for me to want more of this beer. It is decent but not a great german beer.","Dodo2step","May 29, 2008"
3.62,-1.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice beer here, but somehow I expected more. The beer begins with a medium straw color, abundance of carbon dioxide, but with light head retention and only a trace of retention. Aromas of pilsner malt set the tone, but may include some toasted Vienna malt as well. Light hints of corn, and cereal grains, but no harshness- only malty sweet notes. Flavors are more malty than the aroma suggests- impressive here. Again hints of corn (dms) hide in the sweetness. Strong pilsner flavors with a hint of maltiness found in Vienna lagers. Hops are light, maybe too light and provide an herbal flavor, but could use bolder grass flavors and bittering. No real astringency in the textures, but the beer weighs a little heavier on the toung than desired. Certainly a quality brew here, but the heavy sweetness, light hopping, and sulfide notes offers opportunity for improvement.","BEERchitect","May 05, 2008"

3.82,4.1,3,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Pours a golden sunshine, not a lot of head after a hard pour. A few bubbles coming from the bottom of my glass. The aroma is a dry, grassy malt with maybe a hint of something limey. The first taste is a sweet malt, then quickly turns into something more dry. A little mineraly, but still sweet. The palate is a weet, dry, yet smooth palate. Great combination, making for a very easy to drink beer.","scruffwhor","Jan 31, 2008"
4.05,10.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Good, crisp, clear mouthfeel leads to an equally good level of drinkablity due to the relatively low ABV and wonderful, clean flavors... A certainly good representation of the style... Recommended...","dsa7783","Jan 14, 2008"

3.71,1.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer poured a wonderful light gold with a white head. The aroma was of malt with a hint of hops. The taste was a sweet malt with a turn to bitter hop then a final bit of sweetness in the finish that was not overpowering. The feel was light and dry. A pretty decent golden lager, worth sampling again if you wanted this style.","claytri","Jan 12, 2008"
4.03,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a clear, pale golden color. The head is massive, fluffly, and bright white. The aroma is bready, with hints of minerals, and caramel. The taste is bready with a nice, but mild noble hop bit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a what session beers are all about.","KarlHungus","Dec 20, 2007"

4.17,13.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Nice darker gold color. Definitely darker and more robust than American macro "lagers". And brewed from much higher quality ingredients therefore giving this beer a pleasant sweet true beer smell. It smells like a German Lager should. The taste replicates the smell. It's slightly thick and chewy and sweet. But not too sweet. I think of a diluted Werther's Original hard candy when I taste this beer. It's quite good. Easy to drink and not too sweet to drink in any quantity.","berserker256","0"

4.04,10.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. I like the dominant malt balance and the cleanliness of the whole presentation including the hops. The finish gets a little more "harsh" on the palate as the beer warms, but this is a very subtle flaw. For the most part, this is a very drinkable and refreshing beer. I would definitely drink it again, but I don't know how much I will be seeking this beer out.","SkeeterHawk","Nov 02, 2007"

3.75,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"EDIT: It seems like they have actually simply renamed Edelhell to be Munich Gold in the US. Any who says that packaging and advertising can't make a difference! I could've sworn I enjoyed Edelhell more! After having some with a very recent bottling date, I'm now a little more confident in this beer. The nose is pretty amazing fresh. The baked bread scent reminds me of visiting a German brewery.","Domingo","Oct 07, 2007"

3.65,-0.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I just reviewed two beers back to back in hopes of discovering which was the better Munich Helles Lager. I reviewed the Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold and Paulaner Original Munich. Too be honest, I could not find a difference between the two of them. Both were very solid and good beers, nothing spectacular. Honestly, there is such subtle differences between the two beers that I ended up rating them exactly the same. So I tried to discover which is better, and I'm sorry to report, there is not much a difference, but both are good solid beers...","BDIMike","Jul 11, 2007"
3.57,-2.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Ran into the "Gold" label Hacker Helles at me favorite beeratorium. Pours a clear straw color with a rather small head that left no lacing or cap. The smell is typical helles, kind of biscuity, with a light hint of noble hops that produces a slight metallic scent. The taste is light, biscuity malt with the noble hop that sits on the tongue, nothing very distinct. The feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, not crisp, finishes very balanced. An average Helles lager, not sure how this one is different from their other Helles lagers.","Gmann","Jan 07, 2007"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Crystal clear golden. Moderate amounts of carbonation surface slowly through the body of the beer. The head is thin and off-white. Nice, solid aroma of biscuity and bready malts. A little yeast as well on the nose and a dash of hops. Nice malts on the palate. Bready and grainy and biscuity, but definitely not too sweet or grainy. Just right. A touch of dryness from the hops. The body of this beer is about medium. It's very easy to drink and quite a nice summer lager.","Bighuge","Jun 30, 2006"

3.65,-0.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"M&D: crisp and clean mouthfeel with a moderately firm body, true to Germany's high standard of lager-making. This lager tastes way lighter than its abv. (5.5%) leads one to believe, making it all the more dangerously quaffable. Although this style is by no means my favourite in the world of lager, it's a quality brew that I feel so happy to have bumped into in an English brewpub that produces mostly conservative ales~~","wl0307","0"
