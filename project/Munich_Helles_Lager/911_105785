I don't know enough about German beers to say if this is truly traditional, but a beer like this is what I think of when I think of good, light German lagers. I would happily drink more of this.","spoony","Feb 11, 2015"

There is no freshness date on the label.  I see these beers habitually being stored warm on a store shelf, with fluorescent light beating down on them.  As it is, this beer is good but not excellent, and I think freshness might be an issue here.  I paid 3-something for the bottle.","archyquaffer","Jan 01, 2015"

3.91,-2.3,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"My lone non-MF beer today, I just had to go for a nice traditional German helles.  This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises flowers, mild greens, and a hint of biscuit.  The taste brings in more of the same, the hops brighter now, and the biscuit and greens sweeter.  A tasty combination, to say the least.  The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish.  Overall, you gotta hand it to the Germans for continuing to produce solid, enjoyable, and--dare I say it?--refreshing beers like this one.  Good times.","TMoney2591","Oct 11, 2014"
