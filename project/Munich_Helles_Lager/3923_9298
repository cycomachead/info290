Henninger Premium Lager is far from the worst imported lager I've ever had, but at the same time, I can think of plenty of others that I'd rather be drinking. This is a fairly forgettable, industrial-style pale lager whose strongest feature happens to be the price rather than anything relating to the product itself - this is only 2 bucks a can, and I challenge you to find a better beer at that price point in Ontario.

I got two-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head with moderate retention. It created some nice lacing on its way down, however. Color was a slightly cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5). Nose had the typical lager honey-like sweetness and a mild cereal-like graininess. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. I would have sworn that I was drinking Heineken! I actually do not mind Heineken, but this really tasted like it and at a reduced price point. Finish was semi-sweet, very lager-like and a pleasant break from that Minhas crap from earlier.","woodychandler","Aug 22, 2014"

Henninger's lager in the pint cans is the latter of those two. The local Liquor Barn chain store had the six-packs of pints for $6. I divide beer into everyday brews and weekend specials. If you look at the price, it's about like paying $4.50 for a six of something else, which puts you in Budweiser range around here, maybe even Natty Light land. Would I rather drink this? Oh, hell yeah. Is it my favorite? No, but at this price, I'm perfectly happy given most of the things I really like are in the $9-$15 range, or more. In the end, we pick beers because we really like them, and avoid ones we think aren't worth the money. $8?

Green bottle, but no skunk (especially for an import, this surprised me). Nice (very mild) hop smell and a decently balanced (though very light), slightly sweet malt taste. Huge head (in fact the bottle poured foam when I first opened it) that disappated fairly quickly, but left a nice lace on the glass.

A skunky grassy hop rides in there with the cereal. As I sip I get some malts but they're weaker and not sweet at all. A dry grain flavor which is soon washed out by the grassy hop flavor.

It's clear golden body reveals fine bubbles rising steadily towards its short but creamy head of bright white foam. The retention is good, but it eventually erodes to a thin, creamy collar; yet it's still able to leave some sticky splashes of craggy lace. The nose is fresh with a combination of sweetish, grainy malt and floral hops. The body is medium and it's crisp across the tongue with a fine, median carbonation. It's lightly sweet and grainy malt is tempered with floral and spicy hops atop a solid bitterness that leads to a lingering dry finish.
