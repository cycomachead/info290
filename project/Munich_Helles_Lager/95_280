3.5,7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had a tall can of this well-known commercial example of a Munich helles lager in the classic blue and gold colors. This brew pours a lemon drop yellow with a massive amount of white head (unless you choose to mitigate this with your pouring technique, but this way you will get more of the aroma). Releases an aroma of pale green malt and bread yeast, smells sweet with a lot of fruity green grape character and a bit of a skunky sour tang. Palate is sweet white bread, bicarbonate of soda, apple, sour vines candy, grass, hay, and some white pepper spice. Maybe a subtle undercurrent of cherry pit which could very well be something I am inferring for an unknown reason. Fairly thin body and quite dry as per the style, but in all honesty I get a fair amount of sweetness here too that was detectable even by the non-beer geeks who accompanied me. Despite the massive billowing head, the beer was only moderately fizzy and perhaps I let much of the gas escape during the pour. Finishes fairly dry with a lingering green noble hop spicy bitterness that evokes melon rind. All in all, a pretty complex and tasty yet delicate brew that hits the right stylistic notes, even if it is a bit on the sweet side. I could detect no obvious flaws.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 24, 2013"

There could have been more of a bread/biscuit/potato chip starchy fullness to this to give the beer more body but alas, this was pretty watered-down and somewhat generic.

If it has been awhile you might be in for a pleasant surprise. Instead of the tasteless corny beer of the 1980's and 1990's, it is now the original recipe imported from Germany. The pour is a carbonated yellow with about a half-inch of fizzy, longlasting head. For a green bottle the skunkiness is muted in favor of malts, thin yeast, and a slightly hopped background. The taste is tart but clean with barley malts and light hops to wrap around your throat. If you gave up on Lowenbrau years ago it might be worth another shot. Best beer around? Hardly.

I do remember the bad old days when Lowenbrau was just macro crap, being made by some large brewhouse in the US under contract. The brand has been revived. The beer pours a fairly straw pale color with a white, thin head. Just a tad bit of lacing, not much though. This is a fairly crisp beer with a slightly lemony, slightly vinous quality. There is a bit of graininess to the beer, and it has all the characteristics of the style. It is a little bit more substantial than most macro/adjunct lagers, and it does have a nicer spiciness to it, and less blandness than its close relatives. The nose has that wonderful hay like grassiness. This is a light bodied, lightish Helles Lager, and will satisfy those seeking out a representative beer of the style.","albern","Dec 25, 2008"

It's good and it's stylistically solid, but you just can't have much room for error when compared to the other helles beers in Munich.

Sweet Malt on the nose along with a little alcohol.Some lacing. pretty nice balance here...pleasant sticky mouthfeel goes nice with those tongue tingeling grassy hops...lots of hops for a light colored lager....and that 'REAL BEER' taste that seems to slowly be dissapearing on today's market. Becomes even more flavorful at about 45degrees..all kinds of interesting stuff happening at slightly warmer temps instead of going terrible like American Lagers... .very grassy finish with that great familiar bitter, Euro Pale kick. The faintest citrus..say ...aaaa..lemon-juice/lemon-ade.. I wish this was easier to find again. An extremely solid and flavorful lager with the stuff that you should taste instead of what you shouldn't. A good sessionable brew. I want 10 more! Lipsmakin goodness....and priced rt for the quality...7.99/six....at that price it dominates the market for quality and taste. If your a hellas or a light bodied lager that maintains a good mouthfeel fan...then Lowenbrau is for you. The fruit of Edelhell...the euro skunk of Heiny...and the good sticky qualities of Dortmunder GOld...this brew is nice for the price. I'm pretty sure all of it is imported now. Harder to find than it was 15 years ago... ...a personal favorite because of high score on mouthfeel and grassy hops for an easy drinking light-colored lager. Nice bottle too. I can't beleive some here have said it's equal or just above massprolag's....not true...it's an obvious cut above. Everyone should remember this is a German Brewed, whole hopped, hellas lager that gives you a beautiful grassy hop bitter, peppery bite....to the untrained palate this could come off as skunky ...I realize the green bottles skunk easier which brings me to ask...where are some of the reveiwers here buying their beer and do they drink anything other than Bud and Miller...because Lowenbrau is A STAPLE...no other accessible lager gives this blance of Hops, Mouthfeel, Bite, and sessionablity...

3.51,7.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Tonight after work I just felt like a refreshing German lager, and so I picked up a six of the Lowenbrau, a beer I have not had in a very long time. I have always liked the classic light blue packaging, and the bottles are attractive enough, green with the blue and gold labelling. This is a respectable Munich brewer, after all, albeit one of the biggest and most commercial. The lion cap pops off and the beer pours a lightish honey hue with a snow-white cap of fine head that is extremely tight. The head has exceptional longevity, remaining full and creamy for the entire time I drank it. Very good rings of lacing too. As far as a good helles lager goes, this looks mighty tasty. Very grassy hops on the nose immediately, almost sourish. Dusty, with good malt backbone though, adding bready caramel notes. Maybe a little vanilla wafer, sourdough bread, and faint nuttiness. Not a lot going on, but nice balance. The taste is a little more malty than the aroma suggests. Sweet caramel malting, but with some nice pils-style hopping to add a little spice. Definetely not as sweet as some other Munich helles lagers. Like the aroma, the taste is just simply quenching and unoffensive. Lots of good biscuity malt with the hops a little dryness to the aftertaste. This went well with regular tortilla chips and Swiss cheese. The mouthfeel is fairly low in carbonation and easily drinkable. An amiable summer German quencher. Not overly exciting, but nothing I can pick holes in for its style. Solid.","Cwrw","Apr 27, 2006"

Gentle, doughy sweet malt with a toasty, dextrin edge dominates the aroma. Grassy, peppery hops are secondary. Trace sulfur adds slight savory twang. Stately, functional and clean aromawise. In flavor, the prevalent malt character is intially of simple, grainy, white bread like pilsner malt. Becomes progressively drier and parching on the palate, with dessicated cracker notes riding parallel with subtle hay hints that retain a vestige of Saaz derived bitter grassiness. Immaculately clean in flavor and well brewed. Lightly bodied and very well attenuated, but quite brisk and thirst quenching as a result. Finishes abrupt, with a snap of maltose like sweetness and husky grain. Quite an enjoyable, simple, well crafted Helles that seems more apt for a sultry summer afternoon, not a frigid plains winter night.

Head lasts most of the way down the glass and leaves an intricate spiderweb of lacing. Nose is predominantly that of malt resembling sweet pastry, very faint floral hop in the background. Flavour is crisp and grainy, with a dry finish, this lager is more about mouthfeel that flavour. Grassy hops make an appearance on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry.

It has a good head and lace and the taste is not overpowering. ( good table manners )","chilidog","Sep 21, 2002"
3.38,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is one of the first beers I ever tried when I first got into this whole thing.  Nice and golden at the pour with a great head on it, the aroma was a sign of things to come for me in the way of European beers.  Very nice.","goindownsouth","Jul 01, 2002"
3.1,-5.2,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Thick head, quickly settles to thin lace. A good lager, but nothing very complex and nothing really stands out. Probably not as good in bottle or can, but tasty from the pump.","IrishRedRock","Jun 18, 2002"
3,-8.3,3,3,3,3,3,"My only complaint is paying premium price for a totally average beer, even if all "better" beers should match or exceed Lowenbrau's quality.  To separate the good from the non-good, look no further.","shirfan","Jun 09, 2002"
3.2,-2.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Light amber in color, with moderate head with large bubbles.  Smells somewhat hoppy and spicy.  Taste is fresh tasting with good hop bite. Finishes off sweet than it starts. A slightly above average brew.","psugrad98","May 30, 2002"
3.43,4.9,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Not bad ... not bad at all. Surprise surprise, this brew has taken a turn for the better now being brewed in Canada under contract by Labatt. Decent use of hops to balance the malt ... enough to suffice any beer geek and not too much to turn the macro drinker away. Give it a try ...","Jason","May 23, 2002"

3.25,-0.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Nice pale gold, holds a small head. Nothing like I expected, not as hoppy. It was kinda dry on the finish. Served cold it is crisp with a hint of spice. Seems readily available up north, never saw it in the south.","packetknife","May 05, 2002"
