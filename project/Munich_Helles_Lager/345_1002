3.39,-5,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Close to 10 years of cra ft beer geekdom living in both the philly suburbs and south central PA and I have yet to try this Victory offering...  Looking around for something new and unpretentious, this called out to me today from the shelves...  An average pour yields slightly less than a fingers worth of audibly fizzy crisp off-white colored froth that displays minimal to no retention...  It leaves behind a thin veil of splotchy lacing an thin collar...  The color is an exceedingly pale golden straw...  A light to moderate bit of average paced carbonation rises randomly throughout...  The nose is simple and clean...  Loaded with rich bready malts and cereal grains...  A light euro hop presence...  On the palate this one is a bit of a subdued version of the nose...  Perhaps you can mix in a touch of lemon zest as well...  The mouthful is on the fuller side of light bodied...  A bit thin...  A very limited bit of carbonation bite...  Goes down rather uneventfully...  A simple and somewhat enjoyable beer, but in the future I'd much rather opt for the Prima Pils, Stoudt's Gold or a Sly Fox offering to itch my Pennsylvania German lager itch...","philbe311","Feb 28, 2015"

Copious tiny bubbles are seen effervescing in-solution.  Nose expresses cereal grains and a light, grassy quality.  Taste follows nose - fairly clean with a faint sour mash skunk towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and a crisp finish.  Overall, simple, refreshing and quite drinkable.","Jwale73","Jan 27, 2015"

Light medium body with light carbonation. This is a nice Helles that is to style. The taste is laid back, as is the nose, and light with the expected effervescence. A slight sweetness coupled with a bit of hop flavor and bitterness constitutes the flavor profile. Crisp and clean finish with a touch of lingering bitterness.","tillmac62","Jan 08, 2014"

Grainy and doughy for the most part, with a touch of honey, the malt character is quite nice, and nicely complements the hops. Drying, grainy and bitter on the finish with a mild mineral character that actually tastes like it might be a combination of the earthy hops and the carbonic acid. I really like the hop profile of this beer. Light in body without being watery, this beer has a medium-high level of carbonation (appropriately enough) and a drying finish that's mildly hoppy and mildly grainy. Very nice, recommended.","DefenCorps","Aug 21, 2012"

Aroma of light German malts, light floral hops, basic, no nonsense. Taste follows the aroma, pale malts, crackery grains, floral hops, crisp, clean, nothing complex or amazing, but it's a standard lager, so what more can you ask for? Light body, and goes down as smooth as anything. For the style, this is a very good beer. If you want something simple and extremely easy to drink, yet miles ahead of the macro market, look no further.","Rifugium","May 08, 2012"

The taste is clean malt, crisp hops, sweet grainy notes, some mineral tang. It's sharply carbonated, slightly viscous. All in all an excellent Helles, easy to drink and very satisfying.","gory4d","Oct 28, 2011"

4.39,23,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste is light and crisp with some biscuit grain and a fair amount of bright hops...both flavoring and bittering. I like this beer quite a bit, not necessarily a classic helles, but damn is it refreshing and tasty. I would have no problem finishing off a sixer of this in a day. Tasty, clean and interesting...just what I want in a nice lager. Excellent beer, I see a repeat purchase in my very near future.","twiggamortis420","Sep 24, 2011"
3.65,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light to medium body, slightly heavier than your average lager. Crisp, clean taste but some slight lingering of barley malts in the finish. Hops add the crispness and have a small bittering effect that balances out the barley. Definitely a twinge of citrus in the taste, adding a level of complexity that you don't find in a whole lot of lagers. Higher carbonation adds to the crispness. This is just a beer that is not overly complex, but they definitely paid attention to the details and brewed a solid lager with more flavor than most others you'll find out there. Definitely no off adjunct flavors, probably the best part of this beer. Great for a hot summer day that calls for a light and refreshing beer that tastes pretty damn good too.","chodinheaven","Sep 17, 2011"

Mouth is snappy, bright, super fresh grain and a kiss of sweet malt. A touch grassy in its hop element. This was one I overlooked for awhile but it's just fantastic. Understated, extraordinarily well balanced. Of course criminally underrated. One of the best lagers I've ever had, up there with Victory's best pilsners. They are masters with this style.","JAXSON","Aug 29, 2011"

Smells a bit more German than it appears with a little pepper and grain. The taste is so much betters than the look and scent. If I saw this beer in a glass not knowing what it was I would pass it by buy the flavor is on point. I get grainy breaded malts, herbal hop notes and that peppery feel that is necessary for the style. Carbonation is lower but very striking and the beer goes down easy buy it gets too sweet as it warms so it's a gulper. Overall a good representation but could be a little cheaper I'm my opinion for what it is.","jizfiasco","Jul 23, 2011"

And they are the best brewery by volume in my opinion so i'm all for it. Few do it like then quality wise. Mass production worldlyness isn't easy. And with that said... This is a great brew with an american yeast augmentation... Or accent. Look is good. Some subdued head but i can't tell if it was due to the humidity. Gold clear pour. Nice hay and bubble gummy esters. Export sweet nose. Palate is dry... But not pilsner. Nice balance. apple rind, bubble gum and hay. Dry nice balence and some porter grape hopping but with a brisk finish that has hints of biscuit.","rtepiak","May 24, 2011"

There might be a little wooden aromas too but not much. The flavor is pretty hoppy, there is a little bit of a earthy tone in the aftertaste. The malts leave some dryness behind as well.

1.74,-51.3,1.5,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Victory V Lager is a cloudy, pale yellow beer with a small white head that quickly dissipates. It has a soft herbal aroma. It smells a little sweet and corny and very faint. It's light bodied and foamy with a dry finish that's kind of chalky. It has hardly any flavor. There may be a touch of lemon and mint or catnip. There is no bitterness. Sorry, Victory, I've peed better beer. This is an obvious attempt to make a Superbowl beer and they nailed it.","yesyouam","Mar 02, 2011"
4.07,14,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear golden-straw color with a short white head. Carbonation bubbles are apparent. Head does not stick around for all that long. The nose is a bit grainy with some pilsner malt and a bit of floral and herbal hops. The taste brings a bit more of the hop components of the nose along with some grain in the background. Light body with good carbonation and a dry finish. Drinks quite well; very quaffable. This is a nice session brew.","Thorpe429","Feb 14, 2011"
3.77,5.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,4.5,"Beer is thin and wet with a decent finish with a mild acidity that I kind of wish wasn't there. I think this is more like a Czech pils than a Helles. It has nearly nothing between the lead off sweetness and the finishing acidity. No middle ground flavors.

I popped the cap and poured, and was instantly disappointed. Very little head, and a cheap beer color. The smell wasn't all that pleasing, and the taste was worse. easily the worst microbrew lager I've had. Thank God I didn't have to pay for it.

3.3,-7.6,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Unfortunately when i poured this beer there was virtually no head to speak of. It is straw colored and pretty clear. The nose has some grain in it, and maybe a hint of spicy hops. The grainyness in the nose carries through to the taste with a minimal amount of diacetyl butteryness, a bit of an off flavor for a lager like this, but not unpleasant. There is good medium-light mouthfeel for this one. Good enjoyable, but not exceptional beer.","Agold","Jul 14, 2010"

The aroma suggsts a slightly sour mash idea with a little leafy hop. The flavor brings a pretty watery apple cider malt with a mild hop bite. The taste isn't bad but it's kind of wimpy with carboard hints and maybe a touch of toffee. The constitution of this lager even reminds me at times of watermelon. The hop finish keeps it interesting, otherwise it's forgettable but fairly drinkable. It works.","Durge","Jul 10, 2010"

It tasted like a traditional lager but very light. The flavors were barley noticable. Overall I was dissapointed with this. The flavors needed to be much stronger, tasted like a watered down sam adams lager, but cost more money. Deffently not the best lager, or the best beer by victory.","vette2006c5r","Jul 08, 2010"

The aroma is slightly sweet and malty, herbal hops with a bit of floral perfume. The flavor is just as delicate and smooth with a bready malt base and a herbal, floral hop character. This beer is none too exciting, but very tasty with a nice noble hop character. The mouthfeel is very light and refreshing with a nice dry finish that begs for another sip.

The thin body and fairly fizzy texture makes this very easy to down, and the low ABV makes it easy to follow one with another-- that is, if you're in the mood for an uninteresting lager that has the sour smack of an adjunct beer (as far as I know there are no adjuncts used here, but the taste is still there). This is a serviceable beer squarely aimed at the middle of the road, fine for slamming at the barbecue or getting mindlessly hammered on your front porch after work. Otherwise... eh. Pass it by. Better yet, go buy a six of Weihenstephan helles lager instead.","gfreed","May 04, 2010"

Pretty standard looking lager though. Smell was a bit malty, but not much else. Taste was pretty spot on for a lager. Nice balance of flavor profiles. Mouthfeel was pretty crisp and dry. While the flavor didn't blow me away, the smoothness of this beer impressed me. Extremely easy beer to drink, a very good choice for a session beer.

The beer with thin and tasted like nothing I was expecting. Granted this is a step up from Yuengling Lager and the like, but it's not what I would expect from a Victory lager.

As the beer settles, the sweeter malts emerge and some of the less pleasing macro like aromas disappear. The taste improves as the beer settle too. It began with too much the lemony, vegetable, sweetish macro flavors and segued into a slightly better flavor with more complex malts emerging. The beer is moderately carbonated, very light bodied, a bit on the watery side, and not all that interesting. It gets a bit more husky as my palate gets used to it. This is certainly better than most macro lagers you'll find, but if has pretentions to be more, there just isn't that much here that would keep me coming back.

This is a great example of what a lager should look like - perfect clarity, straw colored, lightly carbonated, and with a small head that sticks around for a while but eventually disappears. Would be nicer I guess if the head lasted longer, but I'm not gonna nitpick here. Smell is yeasty and grainy, with a light malt backbone and a grassy but sedate hop profile. Crisp taste first of all, which is good. Followed up by some bready malty tastes and a wee bit of hops. Could be a bit more rounded off in terms of having some nicer, more robust, sweet malts, for balance.

Taste was balanced and refreshing. Short lived sweetness fading to a hoppy finish that is persistent but faint. Mouthfeel is light. This is an easy drinking beer though a tad too "euro lager-ish" for my tastes. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp.

This is like a Budweiser that doesn't taste like shit. Plain but solid. A keg of this wouldn't get any strange looks at a fraternity party, but wouldn't draw the disdain given to macro shit brews.

2.9,-18.8,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"victory really continues to disappoint me. with exception of the wonderfully tasty hopdevil, the other brews of theirs that i've sampled thusfar really seem to be below the standards that i had hoped for them. the all malt lager is easily the worst of the lot that i have had. it pours a macro looking crisp straw golden colour with no head. i was very disappointed here. the smell and taste: average to slightly below average. both are watery and malty with a touch of grass, sweetness and hops. any flavour is way in the back behind the watery characteristics that dominate here. there's nothing here, really. bland. boring. blah. the one thing i will give this brew is that it is crisp and refreshing on a hot summer day, a bit moreso than your standard macro would be/is. this one is better than those macros, but not by much. i expected more from you victory and you keep disappointing. convince me otherwise...please.","SixpointJMH","Jun 25, 2004"

There is a small hop taste in there as well but I cant detect much else. Mouthfeel is decent with good carbonation. This is a beer that would be good to give to someone who is used to macros to try and convert them. A fairly tasty lager that I would probably get again.","meathookjones","Jun 10, 2004"

In mouth, its presence is very mild without too much going on and even a feeling approaching metal in the finish. Body is rather creamy and could use a bit more carbonation I believe.

You don't have to concentrate on this flavor, because there's nothing complex about it, and maybe I see that as more of a strength than might others. Pleasant and quenching, it goes down damned smooth, and that plus the nice flavor adds up to a real good quaffability quotient.

Initially it hit me like most pale lagers do -- kinda' nothin', "fuzzy" carbonation, and very easy drinking -- but the fullness of the malt improves in the aftertaste -- making for a brew that is as easy drinking as any good session brew, but far more satisfying after it goes down. The mouthfeel leaves the palate nicely coated, and the lingering flavor is sweet malt with a bit of spiciness that reminded me of a subtle clove-like flavor.

The finish is clean, with the slightest pucker, and no filler aftertaste. The malt is well balanced, and does not sink or cloy. Hop character is subdued, and serves a supporting role. It's not in there to be the focus, it may not come through as strongly as one might like, and without it the beer would be too thin. Relax with this guy, and take it for what it is.

Aroma: Grainy and light in malt sweetness, there is just a touch of hop presence in the air, I mean I know the helles style lager is delicate but this is a beer marketed toward the masses not one I m proud to hoist from Victory at this point. Taste: Crisp refreshing grassy sweet texture from the imported malts and a good amount of bitterness here to obtain balance, overall disappointing in the flavor department whatever happened to my beloved export style lager, shame on you Bill and Ron your targeting a "Bud/Miller/Coors" crowd with this one what happened to "we brew the type of beers that we like to drink"? Okay that was harsh considering this is a difficult style to make clean tasting balanced brew, I can also fathom how Victory needs a beer on the light side, but this one borders watery for me. Mouthfeel: Is thin carbonated water like texture, just no character. Drinkability: It's alright even good and refreshing but lacking the awesome flavor profile of the export style lager that anyone who purchased the Victory sampler found as a true jewel, in one word disappointing I was at least expecting a very flavorful Helles, oh well yeah I think I could drink a six pack of this without feeling anything. Light, crisp, refreshing lawnmower beer with no off tones, well constructed but lacking flavor.","WVbeergeek","Sep 03, 2003"

Pale yellow with a slim head disappears after a few sips with tiny bubbles rising to the top. Smells like husky grains and is somewhat grassy. Taste is a decent light sweet malt flavor a tinge of hops that are herbal tasting. Does quite well on the palate and is no way extreme in any which way. A very good take on a the german light lager style while not catering to anything specifically because it certainly has more flavor then any macro pale lager and as such is a very good substitute for them. Like a gateway drug of the beer world nothing great nothing bad just plain good is the new recipe. I expect to see Victory turn more peoples head then ever before.
