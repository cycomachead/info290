Its light body and easy drinking ability helps Lux stand out from the common high-hopped IPA.","DoubleJ","Feb 19, 2015"

4.53,20.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a gorgeous clear golden body with a one finger white head that quickly receded to a cap of lace. The perfect appearance for the style. Scents of sweet Pilsner malt, light levels of floral and slightly herbal hops and a light touch of sulphur and honey. Overall impression of aroma is of a very true to style Munich Helles, light, malty and clean. Quite nice. Flavor begins lightly sweet and malty, with notes of honey and Pilsner malt lending a light sugar cookie-like flavor. Light levels of floral and herbal Hallertau hops come through. Middle continues to be lightly sweet with the same malty flavors, but picks up more hop flavors to balance, with the floral and herbal character shining through. Finish is balanced between sweet and grainy malt flavors and floral and herbal Hallertau hops, with medium-light bitterness. Aftertaste is lightly bitter with notes of floral and herbal hops and grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely balanced, crisp, clean Munich Helles lager. Quite true to style and very pleasing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth malty feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very drinkable beer, hitting the style guidelines exactly. Overall this is an excellent Munich Helles lager. It is very true to form in all respects and is a well executed, balanced beer.","Auraan","Feb 02, 2015"

Worth checking out, if this is your particular thing.","biboergosum","Jan 16, 2015"

3.96,5,3.25,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, biscuit, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and quite easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 06, 2014"

Bready,slightly toasty malts dominate the aroma..touch of grassy hop. Taste is the same but has a really pleasing smooth almost buttery hint to it that helps.. Nice smooth low to medium carbonation..Touch of hop in the end. Nice enough summer drinker. Good lager.","Reidrover","Jun 06, 2014"

3.82,1.3,3.5,4,3.75,4,3.75,"O: This is pretty stylistically accurate. Can't quit get over the grain domination, but that happens with Munich Helles. All things being equal, Ninkasi, the brewery known for fairly mediocre beers, is producing some world class German style lagers. I'd prefer they shut down the aleworks and focus on these German styles. They do it better than anyone else on the West Coast. Possibly even the country.","McStagger","May 14, 2014"
3.81,1.1,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Overall- Just a solid, good beer that really rocks the style. Since Ninkasi has expanded, they can make more lagers and if this is any indication, that is a good choice on their part. Definitely, worth a try. Maybe the problem the I've had with the German versions is that they haven't been fresh. This, I think, is pretty fresh and it shows.","artoolemomo","May 14, 2014"

Smells good, taste good, looks good, and great mouthful. This is the definition of a medium-bodied refreshing lager. Got to love Ninkasi, never disappoints me.","stephenrocha1992","May 13, 2014"
