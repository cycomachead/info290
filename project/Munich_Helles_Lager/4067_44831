Light mouthfeel but a little grainy. This is my first helles lager, and honestly this was decenlty refreshing. Honey flavor seemed to dominate and was very pleasant.

It has a nice orange gold color, and though there is some lacing, the head dissipates quickly. Smell has a light grassiness to it. The taste is solid for the style - grainy, a little herbal, not very bitter, and nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is similarly pleasant, with a pleasant malt presence.

Taste is light to medium bodied, nice hop taste upfront, well balanced. Very crisp and clean but light on flavor. Kind of a run of the mill bock that most breweries throw out there, nothing too special about this to separate it from the countless other ones.

The taste goes a different way, with notes of coriander, lemon zest, grass, a touch o' butter, rye bread, and flowers. The body is a rather light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a wet feel.

Yellow straw in the glass with a few bubbles visible. White head that disappates quickly. Hoppy malt (fairly balanced) in the nose with a thin mouthfeel. Flavor is balanced, but there is a bit of a mysterious metallic taste that permeates. It detracts from what could be much more of a positive. As Fordham goes, it's pretty good.

The nose is grainy, and slightly husky, with a touch of floral hops. The body is medium-light with a fine carbonation that leaves it gently crisp and then creamy as it warms across the palate. The flavor displays a well-balanced combination of grainy malt infused with floral, herbal, and delicately spicy hops backed by a firm bitterness that's just enough to balance. It finishes clean, short and dry with just some light residual maltiness. Very nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Jul 27, 2003"

Taste is a nice crisp and clean hop, soem dried variants with nice little herbal hints and some notes of minerals, malts are lightly breadish with a sourdough-like quality. Feel is light, close to medium, super clean and very smooth, quick crispness at first with lightly dry breadish souring finish thats niice.

Sharp tasting beer, thin with appropriate helles accessibility but not especially refreshing and not at all complex. Beer mellows and improves as it warms, and the malts come out to play. A decent US micro lager, probably better when it's absolutely fresh.","Thrasher","Beers"
3.2,-8.8,3,3,3,3,4,"Golden hue w/ excellent clarity.  Quickly receding head leaves a spotty coating of bubbles.  The grainy, bready base malt sweetness in aroma coupled w/ a lightly floral Mittelfruh hop nose.  The somewhat prosaic flavor picks up where the aroma leaves off and is comprised of grainy notes & a generic white bread sweetness.  Hop bitterness, although mild, appropriate balances the light malt sweetness.  Lightly bodied, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that lends good drinkability.  Hop flavor is expectedly subdued, but a hint of herbal / floral Hallertauer is discernible.  Finishes neutral, w/ a light residual sweetness briefly coating the tongue.  This is a decent Helles at best, and is a bit one dimensional & overly simplifed.  Subtle malt nuances characteristic of a good helles were lacking.  It's quite quaffable, however.","marc77","0"
