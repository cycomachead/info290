4.29,19.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Beautiful white-gold flaxen color; furious columnar effervescence in the center of the Sierra Nevada tulip-pint; nice, dusty-ash white ring of foam forms the head; decently robust dry-malt, strawberry-&-banana, orange-flower, and yeast-fruit bouquet arises from deep inhalation; fairly crisp, very smooth, well-bodied and mild flavors of a wheaty-sweetness—almost creamy—with prevalent notes of grass producing an almost acrid, nonetheless pleasant light bitterness that lingers alongside the residual agua-miel characteristics that melt away.  A definite thirst-quencher—along the lines of Ska's Mexican Logger—that would work quite well with hot foods or under hot suns.  Not the most complex of lagers—nor, like many a lager, does it warm particularly well—but it very much seems to achieve Cigar City's stated goals: an effective nod and effectively refreshing and consumable.","OrestesMethuon","Mar 05, 2015"

Medium-light body, just barely creamy texture, above average carbonation, and a grassy bitter finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 15, 2015"

A little more meat on this one than others, frothy and bigger in body, lots more grain base than some imports in the same style. Real low key aroma, attributable for me to a general lack of hops, which is fine, this is a session ale, consumed best in multiples. Holds a nice head and it's bubbles too, and warms up pretty well, which is a nice feature in the Florida sun. I like it feeling a little more substantial, but in terms of flavor it's very in line with style norms. Definitely not the most adventurous beer from these guys, but it serves it's purpose very well.","StonedTrippin","Feb 15, 2015"

3.93,9.5,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured from a can and into a pilsner glass. A light golden and straw color, modest head. Lacing showed some retention but faded towards the end. I believe the power of suggestion played tricks on my senses. The title hotter than hells had me believing that there were some spices. Lo and behold I thought I smelled hot pepper. However, I then noticed on the bottom of the can that it said no pepper just puns; in other words the beer's title is a reference to drinking refreshing lager in hot weather and not spice. Of course as soon as I noticed this, the pepper smell disappeared. Oh well, so much for my sense of smell. What I did notice however, was a nice floral aroma and malt sweetness. Similarly the taste contained these tones. In addition, there were some fruity elements, kind of like a sweetened lemon or hints of orange. Also there was a good bready and malty backbone. Nice feel; crisp, refreshing and light bodied. (definitely a summer drink and quite drinkable). I would have perhaps liked a tad higher carbonation but maybe this would ruin the taste. A nice beer that I enjoyed in the winter. Next time, I will seek it out in the summer when it is truly hotter than hell and make it a session beer.","Gajo74","Jan 16, 2015"
3.94,9.7,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Grabbed a can at Astoria Bier and Cheese. I love a great lager and this delivers. It's a simple, but tasty style and Cigar City nails it. The malts are toasty and crisp with a sweet doughy bread and light caramel. There's a very subtle earthy hops note in the finish, but for the most part, this is a lovely example of pale malts. I'd like to try it side-by-side with Surly Hell and Weihenstephaner Original.","tempest","Jan 16, 2015"

The nose features light grassy notes along with toasted grain, light caramel, and some light notes of citrus. Taste leans towards the sweet side for the style. Sweet grainy flavors up front with some hints of citrus and a light touch of grassy hops. It's not until the finish that there is a slight dryness. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated.

Taste is much the same with grain, grass, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip.

The loud Crack! revealed a brimful craft CAN, but IAW The Old Lady's wishes and the directions on the CAN, the Glug was as gentle as could be. I still managed to create a finger of fizzy, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow (SRM = 2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like German lager - a honey-like sweetness from the malts underlain by a grassiness from the hops. I prefer Czech-style lagers, but this will do. The CANQuest (TM) was built on a steady diet of AALs and I am very glad to have those days in the rear view mirror. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, more effervescent than I might have expected, and the taste was really sweet. In fact, it was too sweet for my taste. I would not have minded a pepper presence at all as opposed to this. Very honey-like, but I have some Blue Dog mead that will satisfy that craving when the time comes. Finish was likewise sweet and now I found myself looking forward to on of their many CANned IPAs to wash away the taste.","woodychandler","Apr 15, 2014"

4,11.4,3.5,4,4,4.25,4,"Picked this one up while on vacation in Daytona Beach. Poured from 12 oz. can into a NB globe glass. Pours cloudy, light yellow in color, thin white bubbly head. Smells outstanding, thick bready malts, banana, citrus fruit, bubblegum. The taste is light, nice balance of malt with some floral hops in there as well. Slightly fruity, hints of lemon. Mouthfeel is thin, bubbly, carbonated. Refreshing, perfect for summer. Overall a great hot weather beer, flavorful, satisfying, delicious. This brewery never disappoints.","mattsdenney","Jul 28, 2013"

Being a beer geek, I never realized that the name makes people think the beer is spicy; but I've had people ask me if it's made with peppers. When you have to explain twice on the label that the beer doesn't have any hot peppers or spices in it, I think you have a problem.","Shaw","Jul 17, 2013"

3.99,11.1,3.75,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a straw yellow with a fizzy soap bubble head that goes away quickly and leaves a little scrim. The beer’s body is quite clear with just a slight haze to it and a steady stream of lazy bubbles working to the top of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and grassy, almost like a very dry strawberry smell with touches of bread. The malt is super sweet and fruity on the nose but the grassy hop backing gives a balance to the smell and makes this beer more inviting to the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet with a finish of smooth grassy bitter hops. The flavors begin as sweet bready malt with a faint touch of fruity strawberry, this dries out slowly and becomes progressively bitterer grassy flavors with nuances of sweet malt and very slight green pepper notes. The finish is creamy sweet bread malts that linger nicely into the aftertaste and slowly dissipate onto the palate leaving grassy bitter to tingle on the tongue. In the can, the beer smells weak, with very little of its nuances escaping through the hole. It tastes less sweet when sipped from the can with none of the fruity malts, but a nice bitter grassy hop’s kiss. It tastes slightly more refreshing from the can, but not as complex or nuanced. In the mouth the beer feels slightly prickly in carbonation, which helps to balance out the sweetness of the beer. The beer also feels medium thick in body. The mouth is left clean but with a nice swath of saliva dribbling on the tongue. Overall, I like this beer. It is sweet, but balanced well with hops and carbonation, and it is refreshing and interesting on the palate. A great sessionable sipper from Cigar City.","Maxwell","Apr 10, 2013"

And considering I am only about 4 hours drive from there, it's pretty fresh (yeah its in a can but I get it closer than others..) I feel like that if there were a little more malt finish, the Helles style would be complete.

The nose comprises wheat, sweet flowers, and a kiss of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a bit more of both the flowers and the grass. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this is a nice little helles, nothing earth-shattering, but it's not meant to be. It's a pleasant session beer, perfect for those who need a lighter option when the weather turns all Floridian and whatnot.","TMoney2591","Beers"

Good retention. Bubbles. Smell is pretty pale malted up with some underlining spicy hop notes. I get some fruity scents, but that may be from the previous beer on tap. Taste is helles, than I get the fruity flavor as well, which kinda kills it for me. Rich German hop flavor and malt mixes well with a light enough body but I am unsure of the semi fruit flavor I am getting. Feel is on point, light and spritzy carb, a nice hop bite towards the end. I was hoping for more, perhaps I am spoiled by all the great German style offerings local to us in SEPA, but Hotter than Helles was a dud.","BARFLYB","Apr 29, 2012"

Biscuity sweet malt aroma with hints of floral hops and an earthy grass character. Aggressive, somewhat fizzy carbonation up front that turns buttery smooth through the middle. Biscuit malt and floral hop bitter flavors with a apple-like sweetness in the background. The hop flavors peak toward the end with a tangy twist of he taste buds.

I love the brewery and everything I have had by them until this one.","Swim424","Feb 07, 2012"
4.05,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer pours a bright golden straw color that has nice clarity. there is about a finger of white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a nice bit of lace behind on the glass. The nose is of grainy malt sweetness. There is also some fruitiness, honey, spicy hops, and some earthy grassiness. The taste followed what the nose suggested. It started off with some grainy malt sweetness. There are some nice flavors of honey, fruit, and some earthiness. Also, there is an earthy spicy hop presence. The finish leaves some lingering earthiness, hop presence, and the sweet maltiness behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down really easy, and it has a really smooth feel to it. There is some sweetness at first, and then a nice earthiness comes in and balances it out. Also, there is some spice and bitterness from the hops that is really nice. It has a nice refreshing quality to it. There is really good drinkability here. I could easily have a few pints of this in a night. It goes down really easy, has nice flavor, and is pretty refreshing. Overall, I think it is just a solid beer, and I recommend trying it out. I would buy this one again. I can see it being really nice on a hot summer day. I hope i run into it again.","JizackFH","Feb 05, 2012"
