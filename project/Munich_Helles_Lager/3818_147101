The aroma is almost non-existent, with very faint notes of bread and hops. The taste is more assertive, but still pretty mild. It's not bland but it doesn't have the depth of flavor other Helles Lagers have. It's not at all heavy, nor should it be and is light and crisp.","delta490","Saturday at 06:39 AM"

4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 1/16/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and slight yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, cracker, biscuit, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and slight yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is an excellent Munich helles style. All around great robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Maybe just slightly hoppier than I expected, but really well done all around. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2015"

I like my beers "bright" when it comes to the flavor and this felt a bit "flat" for me, even if the mouthfeel was certainly crisp enough. Sure, this would be a decent choice once the weather warms up but by itself, this reminded me too much of the Eurotrash Pilz. Not one of Southern Tier's better offerings.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 27, 2015"

Crystal clear, light golden pour with 1" foamy head that hung around for a minute or two and hung some lace on the glass the whole way down. Light hops smell maybe some bread. Perfect carbonation, and a crisp refreshing taste that you could  handle all day long. Hope I can get lots more of this as summer approaches.","classixIII","Feb 19, 2015"
