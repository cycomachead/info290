3.52,0,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Sierra Nevada shaker pint. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a quarter finger white head that dissipates to patches and wispy lacing. Aroma of sweet bready malt, grain, faint grassy hops. Flavor follows, with sweet bready malt, fairly grainy, moderate German style hop bitterness in the finish, which has a light biscuit malt character. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fairly traditional helles lager with light flavor combining grains and light sweet malt. Nothing exciting, but a solid lager.","LiquidAmber","Nov 22, 2014"

The noble hops at mid-palate mix with the malt and infuse an apple-like flavor into the beer. Very pleasant and easy-drinking, but lacks any malt complexity.

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This German lager gets all the details right: light, fluffy head floating over straw to honey slightly clouded liquid gold. The head is fluff of microscopic bubbles that fade to light lacing, a smell of bread and yeast that yields to a malty sweetness, with just a hint of herb from the hops. The taste is classic and rich; certainly won't satisfy any palate looking for a hoppy shot, but this classic lager is rich and buttery with lots of flavor for bier that's gone through laggered fermentation. Helles: full beer rather than hefe, half. Rich, buttery mouthfeel. Very drinkable; repeatable. Lovely.","salvo","Mar 20, 2010"

Semi tart character going on with very light herbal hops in the background. Flavor has cereal notes with herbal hops a mineral character going on as well. A pretty bland and straight forward light German lager. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation nothing too exciting or overwhelming here, nice packaging with pretty average beer.

Aroma is minimal, light malts and hoppiness. Taste starts with sweet pale maltiness, and is balanced by crisp hoppiness soon after. Light fleeting tartness out of place in the center.
