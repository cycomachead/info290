Tastes of chemicals and grain.  Something off-putting about it.  I got a lingering, bitter aftertaste.  I'm going to have to revisit.

Taste is also malty but with a subtle hint of grapes. Medium bodied -- good session beer and a good alternative for someone that feels like getting a lager with a little kick to it but nothing crazy.

Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of bready malts for the most part. The taste has more going on even with a sweet bread taste followed by a slight dry finish. Clean and crisp and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Lighter to medium bodied. Overall a great brew!","BeerWithMike","Aug 02, 2014"

The aroma has nice bready malt with hints of earthy hops. The taste is similar, but with just a really good depth to it. It's not complicated, it's just good. The body is not too heavy but has a satisfying weight to it and a light hops bite on the finish. Always a good lager.","delta490","May 19, 2014"

The beer smells of barley malt and some grassiness from the noble hops. The taste follows the nose to the letter. I get those flavors of the malt, which are pretty bready. Those noble hops provide some nice mild grassiness on the back end to help balance the beer. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is very high.

The aroma has a grainy, slightly spicy character to it as it enters the nose, like wheat and cloves, and one can also detect banana and European hops as well. The flavor is nice and balanced, with a sturdy malt foundation and just the right amount of hop bitterness. It is light bodied, but feels good coating the mouth and going down. The only negative I find is that there is a tiny bit of a metallic/oxidized off flavor in there sometimes. Overall, this is a staple everyday beer in my refrigerator.","Neorebel","Apr 29, 2012"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, spices, rice, fruit, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, spices, floral, fruit, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this one was definitely not my favorite of this style. However, the flavor did a pretty good job of making up for this. The flavor was really nicely balanced, but wasnât very complex unfortunately. Worth trying for sure as it is very easy to drink.","thagr81us","Jan 22, 2012"

The aromas were a bit off, they smelled quite strongly of hops that were getting close to being too old as well as a serious amount of pale malt aroma. The taste however was rather straight forward and real pleasant. The hops tasted rather fresh still on the palate and the malts were savory and crisp. On a side note, I was so happy, because I was later able to consume bratwurst which works so well with that fresh on the palate. The mouth feel was a bit syrupy, but then again this was old school from the keg who knows how the carbonation worked. It still tastes really fresh and went down so very smooth.

Overall, this is a classic over and Germany and I can see why. It is very drinkable, and would be great to enjoy in the warm outdoors while eating a bratwurst.","cjgator3","Jul 13, 2008"

Taste is dominated by a spicy hop bitterness that is never out of check. Sweet toasty malt sweetness provides an ideal balance. Hints of golden apple fruitiness add interest.

Aromas of soft pilsner malts balance well against a complementary cereal grain flavor that doesn't seem to deter. Spicy, earthy Saaz hops are undeniable-- pungent and grassy. Flavors favor the malts, but balanced once again with the raw barley flavors and spicy hop notes even deep into the finish. Clean and light on the palate; nearly airy. Thirst quenching, refreshing, crisp in the finish and a smooth spicy hop lingering. This beer begs to be sessioned on these 90+ degree days.","BEERchitect","Jun 08, 2008"

To me it is a slight step above Miller Genuine Draft in terms of taste. Mouthfeel also very average, again reminds me of MGD. Because of its similarity to MGD its drikability is just average as well.

As it warms up a bit a soft, though simple, malt sweetness becomes present as does a touch of butterscotch. The hop character opens up a bit more; it leans towards grassy notes with perhaps a hint of lemon zest. The perception of bitterness really is muted once the beer warms up as well, though it still provides a sharp backbone to the flavor profile. Somewhat light bodied, but still has a touch of structure and body to it. A decent beer, which is probably even better fresh.","Gueuzedude","Aug 07, 2007"

The smell was light and malty, maybe you could imagine honey in the aroma (could be the color of the beer or surroundings that did that to me). The flavor was simple but delicate, malt with a nice carbonation tickle and a hint of hops bite on the back-end. Just about right for the syle I think.

Really nice aroma for this style. Taste follows suit with great bready malt tones. Warm and biscuity. Rounded sweetness. Crisp and ever so slightly dry on the finish. Medium full body with an agreeable mouthfeel. This is a very solid Helles Lager.","Bighuge","Oct 06, 2006"

3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- There isn't much to say about mouthfeel except it's pretty average... mellow, light, and subtly carbonated. It doesn't necessarily improve or diminish the beer's overall enjoyment. This is the first time I'm drinking this out of an appropriate glass, and it's a much more interesting beer. Effortless and thirst-quenching, I'd pair this with burgers or common German cuisine anytime and be quite content.","yelterdow","Sep 30, 2006"
3.4,-8.6,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Overall, a nicely crafted beer that does nothing wrong. It leans more toward a Helles than a Marzen. A bit more malt, noble hops, and color would put this more squarely into the Okto category and give H-P and Spaten a better run for their money.","MillRat","Sep 30, 2006"

In a sense this is a very approachable Helles, but my palate tells me one bottle is more than enough... It simply fails to keep my interest or focus, as I simply prefer fuller, hoppy lagers like a true Pilsner. That said, this beer is well-crafted for sure.","wl0307","Sep 22, 2006"

It looks marvelous in the glass (bright, frothy yellow/amber) with a delicate hops smell as you raise the glass to your nose.

There's a slight unpleasant sharp acidic soapiness at first that mellows as the brew warms and comes into its own, but nonetheless is there. Mouthfeel is sparkly and warm, full bodied and not over-carbonated. A decent summer brew, but the taste leaves just a little something to be desired.

The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium-light body and good carbonation. The hoppiness lingered pleasantly on the tongue.

When drinking from a tall mug you first get the smell which in itself would only leaving you wanting this fine aroma of only the best barley and hops on your palate. Like any wine connoisseur would tell you the smell alone will tell you if the nectar is as sweet as the flower. With this one the statement holds true. Paulaner has its own unique pils taste that cannot be matched by any other, like a fine beer that is sweet but not a sugar sweet taste. That makes you wonder if I were a brewmaster would beer connoisseurs taste a truly unique taste that would only leaving them comparing all other beers to mine.

The nose was malt dominated with honey, sourdough bread, and a bit of graininess. There was a touch of grassy hops. The taste was just as advertised by the aroma, with mostly a grainy, sweet character, and a light dose of fruitiness (bananas and apples mostly), and a lemony sourness. The hops showed up as a spicy finish with a peppery prickliness to them. The aftertaste was just a tad bit dry, urging you to gulp down the beer faster.

The color is clear gold with a white head. Bubble streams are small and constant. When I opened the pint bottle there was a definite skunk aroma that eminated from the bottle. This carried through into the glass but lessened in a few minutes. The other aroma that began to come through was hops (Saaz?) The bottle was a pale bronze and I wonder if that lends to light passage similar to the green bottles so popular in Europe. There was a good sense of bready grains with a strong side sense of hops to balance the malt sweetness. This seems like a Pilsener style lager but is not advertised as such. Overall this is a better than macro beer, but not one of the best of the German lagers.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 27, 2003"

The taste mirrors the smell with black pepper flavored hops and a pronounced yeast background that makes for a lightly sticky light-bodied brew. Although IÂm reviewing this in the winter, today in Texas was quite warm as we top the hill of the roller-coaster temperatures that we encounter in the winter. So this beer went down quite well.

The light color is deceiving though, as IÂve said before, the Germans are masters at packing flavor into light colored beer. This is another example. The aroma is of fresh bread, lightly toasted malt. The flavor screams purity, nary an adjunct to be found. The bready, malty flavor is accompanied by precise, dry finishing noble German hops. Carbonation is crisp, prickly and steady. The perfect accent for my pesto pasta.","John","Jan 23, 2003"

It took three bottles to fill my mug, and it looks perfect the golden color and the huge thick frothy white head. That same great European lager fresh and sending nice scents of malt. Amazing, and then I took my first sip. A huge malty treat, refreshing smooth lemon grassy sweetness.

It's got significantly more body and malt flavor than a German pils, but with less emphasis on hops.  It finishes with a welcome and subtle hop bitterness on the tongue.
