2.77,-29.7,3,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a medium size off-white head with OK retention. Aroma of roasted malt is mostly dominant with some vague spice notes. Taste is dominated by roasted malt notes with light dry caramel and some distant spices notes. Body is light with medium carbonation. I thought this was short on character and not something I would seek again.","Phyl21ca","Dec 22, 2014"

While it is a decent beer, it does not taste like any traditional Sahti I have had, and I think that is what I was expecting. My wife is Finnish and every summer I wind up drinking Sahti homebrew. Arctic Circle seems harsh by comparison. Just my two cents worth, it might be a regional thing or local ingredients, but I have not had a Sahti that tastes this bitter.","polloenfuego","Nov 29, 2014"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"If this beer sounds different from anything else on the market it's because it is. Arctic Circle Ale is bound to be a true discovery for most people. A real tough one to properly assess without much experience with Sahti, the only opinions I can really share are that I enjoyed it and found it a deeply interesting ale. This one is absolutely worth the adventure and exploration.","biegaman","Nov 22, 2014"

4.07,3.3,4.25,4,4.25,3.5,4,"Final Grade: 4.07, a solid A-. Huvila Arctic Circle Ale is a stellar herbed beer, though having had no other sahtis I cannot provide much perspective on how it compares to other examples of the style. This brew manages to maintain an ideal balance between syrupy, malty sweetness and the spicy, herbal features imparted by the juniper, English hops and rye malt. Great stuff; worth seeking out if you are at all a fan of traditional herbed beers, gruits, etc.","thehyperduck","Nov 21, 2014"
