4.02,14.2,4.5,3.75,4.25,3.5,4,"Medium-thick body, Dark, mostly opaque, copper/amber with a lace of off white head. Aroma is of of roasted malt with hints of fruit and toffee . Taste is malt and tart to start fading to a malty coffee like after taste. Very thick with little carbonation it drinks smooth but leaves a thick chewy feel. Taste strengthens greatly as it warms, best at around 60- 65* as it get overwhelming as it continues to warm.","jminor92","Jan 22, 2015"

3.79,7.7,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall:  A very tasty beer.  I really like the flavors of dried stone fruit and molasses and brown sugar-like sweetness.  The herbaceous bitterness as the finish provides a very interesting counterpoint as well.","Jeffreysan","Dec 13, 2014"

3.68,4.5,3.25,4,3.5,3.25,4,"Very noticeable hints of juniper. Full body. Medium-dark color. A bit of a boozy after-breath. Delicious beer though. Ive found its best consumed @ > 50 degrees F.","brother_rebus","Oct 29, 2014"
