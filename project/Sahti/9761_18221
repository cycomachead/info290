3.17,-8.1,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,"This brew poured out as a flat looking amber color with no head on top at all. The smell of the beer was herbal with some other odd aromas coming off of it. The taste is interesting, lots of herbal juniper flavors and other things that I can't honestly say I've tasted before. I can't really describe it. The mouthfeel was flat and rather bland. Overall I think if the carbonation wasn't so low on this one it'd be easier to drink and more enjoyable all around.","Knapp85","Oct 01, 2011"

2.97,-13.9,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Served with a large bubble, sudsy head the color of the brew which was a hazy dark amber. Aroma was spice, licorice, malt. Flavor is similar but butterscotch is present also. Plus a bit of tang. Body and carbonation are true to style. Finish is like flavor and quite long. Seems to be what a sahti is all about except for the butterscotch which I’m not a huge fan of.","drpimento","Feb 16, 2010"
3.7,7.2,4,4,4,3,3,"On cask at the One Pint Pub. This is a 2 day old cask straight from the Lammin brewery. This beer pours a murky brown with almost no carbonation whatsoever. The owner of the bar (and one of the brewers of the beer) explained that traditional Sahti should have almost no carbonation. The aroma contains quite a bit of banana, caramel and just a slight bit of juniper berries. Also just a tiny tartness is starting to come through on the backside of the aroma. The flavor is a banana bomb. Wow, I always thought that juniper should take the first seat but in this, it’s definitely banana. Juniper comes through with a bit of caramel. The tartness is a bit more pronounced then in the aroma. For as much emphasis as the brewer put in telling me that it is fermented with bakers yeast and not brewers yeast, I really don’t taste that much of a difference. Overall it’s a bit to much banana for me. I wish the juniper was a bit more pronounced but it really is a experience to drink 2 day old cask Sahti","hwwty4","Feb 09, 2010"
2.88,-16.5,2,4,3,2,2,"O/D - Not a great one by any means. Mouthfeel is weird and too light. Seems like it should be a little syrupy but it comes as watery. Taste is too mild IMO. Wouldn't seek it out at all and probably not a good example of the style.","tbeckett","Feb 03, 2010"
3.5,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed on 12/31/2009. Bottle from Ginger Man. Pours a brown/amber with no head. Aroma is stewy with chestnut, pepper spices, and sweet apple. Flavor of lots of spices and some light fruits in the background. Rather quaffable. I rather enjoyed my first authentic sahti.","LilBeerDoctor","Feb 01, 2010"

3.12,-9.6,3,3.5,3,3,3,"D: Not the most drinkable Sahti ever. Lacking in most departments.","avalon07","Jan 14, 2010"
1.28,-62.9,2,1.5,1,2,1,"NOTE: Someone mentioned a freshness date in their recent review... I was not aware of such a thing, and unfortunately, my bottle was promptly disposed of at the bar where it was served... but I must assume that the beer I sampled was far-beyond the recommended freshness date.","jgasparine","Jan 01, 2010"
3.72,7.8,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall this is probably the most authentic sahti I've had (the other being Nogne O's interpretation). It's certainly not a bad beer but it's an obscure style for a reason. Worth a shot for the curious.","glid02","Dec 23, 2009"
3.39,-1.7,3,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Pepper, juniper, and what I can only describe as pitch dance across your taste buds in the finish, while a pleasant tartness clings to the roof of your mouth long after you've drained your last swig of this rustic brew. A good example of a unique style.","Keene","Dec 21, 2009"

3.49,1.2,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"11.2 ounce bottle, $4.99 @ DeCicco's in Ardsley NY, they said this only has a shelf life of about 2 weeks and they had received it just a few days ago. Pours murky, darker brown, next to no head, no lace. No carbonation, no bubbles, no nothing. Interesting nose with notes of spruce, mint, bubble gum and white wine. In the mouth the lack of carbonation is quite evident, notes of jam, more spruce, mint, white wine and bubblegum. A distinct sour notes come through loud and clear as it warms up a bit in the glass. Quite dry in the long finish. Interesting to try but I highly doubt I would reach for this one again.","Billolick","May 28, 2006"
3.87,12.2,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"My first of the style. I was told great lengths were engaged to keep this cold in transit as it goes bad quickly. Guess i have to drink it right away. An interesting look. Like an orangish ice tea. Some bubbles on the top. Quite cloudy. Smell is sweet and bubble gum like with a hefe like wheatiness. Taste is much like a flat hefe with a thicker feel. Banana and clove with a wheaty twang and more bubble gum. Some alcohol as well. There is a light tingly carbonation as it sits on your tongue. Still this has a somewhat syrupy feel to it. Goes down pretty nicely on a cold winter night. Not bad. Not what you think when you hear beer but not bad at all.","scootny",
