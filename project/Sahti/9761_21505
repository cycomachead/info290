1.5,-54.1,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"This sounded so cool with Juniper (I'm a fan of gin) and I greatly anticipated trying it, but alas it's just not to my taste. Poured only a few soap suds bubbles of head and they popped immediately. The body is a hazy apple cider brown (or muddy water, take your pick). Smells so weird, not at all like the gin smell I expected. I'd say it smells more vegetal. The taste is like pickle juice only more sour. Quite unpleasant. I don't know, maybe this is a good example of the Sahti style (first I've had of it) but I couldn't stand this. It was a pricey drain pour.","MoreThanWine","Nov 20, 2011"
1.74,-46.8,2.5,3.5,1,1.5,1,"Kataja Olut IVB is a very clear, solid, caramel colored liquid with no head to speak of. It has a sweet aroma of juniper berries and a host of herbs that my nose can't identify. There's something like soy sauce in the background. It smells like a fortified wine, not a beer. It's medium light bodied, flat and abrasive. It kind of hurts my mouth. This tastes like... beer gone bad; oxidized and infected. It's salty and it burns. I don't know if this is intentional, but I suspect not. Down the drain it goes. There's no indication as to when this was bottled, but it probably wasn't recently.","yesyouam","Nov 15, 2011"

4.21,28.7,2.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Thanks to beersack for the share. The brew pours a murky and rustic deep caramel hue and is totally devoid of head or signs of effervescence; the rustic aspect saves the score. I smell sweet caramel, oxidized vinous notes, and perhaps suggestions akin to plum wine. The flavor is surprising, as is just about everything with this brew; the first anomaly is that I do not detect any trace of juniper or spruce - I am not sure whether this is an older faded bottle or if it always tastes like this. The taste is more like an English Barleywine, as if executed by a Belgian brewer, and is replete with heavy suggestions of toffee and dark fruit, oxidized vinous notes like a Marsala wine, some concord grape sweet fruitiness that I often find in Flanders Reds, small nuances of mulled spices and tea, and a slightly lemony finish. Very complex. The feel is more lively than its appearance suggests, and is medium-bodied, silky and p√©tillant enough to carry the flavors. Overall, I am very impressed with this, my first real Sahti.","ktrillionaire","Feb 23, 2011"
2.86,-12.5,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Juniper and caramel with some copper in the background. Thick and sweet with a tangy aftertaste. Not tart, though. Not bad, think I'll do a little more investigation within this style..you know, just for shitz.","dragonWhale","Nov 15, 2010"
4.27,30.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall this is super-neat. It's kind of a sipping beer, and as a sahti, this is different than what a lot of beer drinkers would expect. Not as off the wall in terms of sourness as a Flemish beer, but definitely exciting and worth a try.","zaphodchak","Aug 30, 2010"
2.99,-8.6,3,4,2.5,2.5,3,"This beer was a little too unique for me I think... This beer pours from the bottle as a hazy brown color and it has a ton of sediment in it. The aroma is very intriguing, it's got a lot of juniper and other spices. The mouthfeel is fairly light but the flavor is really strong. The beer didn't have much carbonation at all. I just wasn't feeling this one too much.","Knapp85","Aug 22, 2010"
