3.79,-1.8,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Body seems rather thick to me, quite smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation and a malt-forward finish. Here's where I get some caramelized rye. Its an interesting brew, to be sure. Wickedly different from Wild Rose's recent take on the style (brewed with weizen yeast for a radically different flavor; insert cross reference here) and I am left wondering if anyone here in this country truly knows what a sahti tastes like. I certainly do not, not with any real degree of certainty. Doesn't really matter, if these attempts enrich our beer scene.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 30, 2014"

3.77,-2.3,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"If juniper infusion (be it berry, twig, or leaf) is what it takes to be a veritable Sahti, then a veritable Sahti this is.  More west-coast IPA or ESB (I know) in its overall bearing, the extra ingredient is like the pea to the storybook princess - not all that detectable at first, but somehow you just can't help noticing it after a strangely short amount of time.  Worthy of checking out, if you're into what native Suomi are all about.","biboergosum","Dec 05, 2014"

4.05,4.9,4.25,4.75,3.25,4.5,4.5,"O: Good beer, well-balanced, the juniper really works well with the hop flavor. Not much malt flavor in there which is fine, it seemed a little light for having 7.7% alc.","ZachT","Dec 18, 2013"
3.85,-0.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Not a typical Sahti , this is a hopped up PNW version of the Finnish style. The higher ABV and the big hops make this taste more like a DIPA. The juniper comes up in the nose and the finish but mostly this a tasty IPA that has some darker undercurrents from the Sahti profile.","canucklehead","Dec 08, 2013"
