3.78,-3.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Taste is a little more on the grainy rye end of the spectrum, with more bubblegum yeast steamrolling in. Not sure where the juniper comes in to be honest, but I trust it's a component in the mix. Medium bodied, lightly sweet at first and finishing dry. Overall worth a try, would have liked more juniper flavor, but a drinkable clean beer nonetheless.","emerge077","Mar 13, 2015"
