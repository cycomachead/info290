4.4,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"I googled to find the serving temperature recommendation and it said about 40 degrees, but based on the thick rich sweetness of it, I figured it would be better closer to room temperature. So I left he last third to warm up. For once I think I was wrong. I think it was actually a good bit better colder. The taste is so strong it doesn't get wiped out by the cold.","BrownNut","Jan 09, 2013"
4.1,6.8,4,4.5,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a pint glass, the beer was a cloudy color with a soft white head. The head dissolved rather quickly to leave a white lacing around the sides of the glass. In the aroma, one immediately notices the juniper, making me think of a gin and tonic. At the same time, the nose also reveals a strong dose of honey that puts a sweet edge on the juniper. This is not like the sahtis I have tasted in the past. On the initial taste, honey and biscuit come to the forefront with the bubbles quickly brushing this away. A mild sense of fruitiness is detectable. As the carbonation mellows the juniper sours the honey in the aftertaste. In the bigger sense, the carbonation might be too aggressive as the sweetness fades too quickly into the sour. At the same time, the sour of the juniper at the end is the best aspect of the taste. I am unable to saw that this is my favorite sahti, but it is among the best.","JohnnyHopps","Nov 28, 2012"
