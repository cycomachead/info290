4,2.8,,,,,,"O - My first experience of the style, but based on the flavour profile and mouthfeel, and the BA description (with the exception of ABV), I certainly feel that this brew lives up to the true characteristics of the style.  A pleasure to have had the opportunity to try.","andrenaline","Jul 29, 2014"
