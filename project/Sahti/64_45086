4.44,14.1,3.5,5,4.25,3.75,4.75,"O = This beer defied all my expectations.  Heavily spiced and aromatic, sweet and warming, a perfect beer for Christmas time (there's even a reindeer on the bottle).  Too sweet and heavy to be sessionable (not to mention the 9% abv), more of a dessert beer.  HIGHLY recommended.","Das_Reh","Feb 08, 2015"
