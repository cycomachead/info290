I chose the rum barrel aged beer on this cold evening because rum reminds me of the Caribbean and I needed some warm thoughts...and the alcohol warming as well.","dbrauneis","Jan 16, 2015"

May be hit-or-miss for hardcore dubbel fans, but for the curious, open-minded BA, a nice ale for sure.","Greywulfken","May 18, 2014"

4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into chalice, 2013 bottling. Pours slightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of plum, raisin, fig, pear, toast, caramel, brown sugar, light chocolate, clove, pepper, oak, toffee, light vanilla, light brandy, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, malt, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of plum, raisin, fig, pear, toast, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, toffee, oak, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, chocolate, brown bread, brown sugar, clove, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and robust malt flavors; with a fair amount of barrel presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged dubbel. All around great complexity and balance of yeast ester, robust malt, and moderate barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

3.73,-5.8,4.25,3.75,3.5,4.25,3.75,"O - The base beer is a classic example of an American-brewed Belgian beer that's clearly American-brewed, though certainly isn't bad. Unfortunately, this beer seems to have spent very little time in the barrel (probably a continuously used barrel at that) as it tastes young. It hasn't been given the chance to really mingle with the Brandy, which is more of an after thought.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 27, 2013"

4.03,1.8,3.5,4.25,4.25,3,4,"The feel doesn't translate as well in this beer. It's smooth, yes, but really seems to run thin. There's not much crispness to liven it, not that I want more than just a little. It simply seems like the brandy got to the body and brought it down some. For a heavy style, meant to be a meal, the body ought to be there. Still, this is a great beer overall.","Brenden","Jul 08, 2013"
4.25,7.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Overall, this is a very nice barrel-aged Belgian, the brandy notes blending perfectly with the Belgian notes, and setting a high standard for others to follow. The brandy barrels are inspired here, as too often Belgians are aged in bourbon barrels, which can lend far too harsh of an alcoholic kick. There is perhaps an overabundance of sugar and sweetness as a result, and licking your lips can seem like licking brandy-soaked brown sugar pops, but the beer is nice enough that this isnâ€™t much of a problem.","jondeelee","Jul 07, 2013"
