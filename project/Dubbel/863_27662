Served from growler into a Green Man snifter (I think I left my –tion glass in Florida at aasher’s wedding ). Opened with a HUGE pop! Poured a deep ruby red brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, smoke, bread, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, fruit, bread, dark fruit, subtle earth, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There was quite a bit going on in this one that definitely kept me guessing throughout each sip. I went into it based on the style knowing what to expect, but this one actually surprised me slightly. The smoke note carried on throughout the glass which was a very nice touch that brought another level of complexity to my palate that I always love to find. With a nice touch of roastiness going on with dark fruit profile this was definitely one that I’m glad I finally got the chance to try. Hopefully I will get to try the rest eventually. Get on brewing those up for me Russian River. I will be waiting…","thagr81us","0"

3.85,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Draft, Russian River. Pliny the Younger 2010 release. This is a pretty good Belgian-style ale from RR, but it's a bit boring, particularly for the brewery. It's a orange-amber beer with a foamy white head. The malt flavors bring a lot of fruitiness to the beer. There are peaches, apricots, apples, dates and figs. However, despite all that, it has a relatively simple flavor and not enough earthiness or depth. A good beer but not something to go out of your way to try.","popery","Feb 07, 2010"

4.19,9.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall: A nicely done Dubbel. Not quite as complex as some, but immensely drinkable with a fantastic nose. I enjoyed it more the second time around when I tried it on New Years Day in the company of BAs Rapapoda, Watermelonman and his Girlfriend Stacy. Nicely done!","TheLongBeachBum","Beers"
