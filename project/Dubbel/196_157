3.74,-2.1,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Tried a bottle just a few months off the expiry date. Poured into a Chimay goblet. Beer was a pleasing red/russet hue, quite sparkly with a fair amount of brown foam that held its form well. I screwed up the pour and got a decent yeast cake floating in the glass but not a big deal. Aroma very fruit-forward, fresh grapes, plums, and oranges along with sweet bread and spicy phenols that evoke anise and clove. Palate complex and includes some interesting flavors, even in the world of ester and fusel hurling Belgian yeast strains. Starts fruity, with the aforementioned grapes, citrus, and something even sweeter like classic Belgian yeast bubblegum, blackcurrants, a hint of sour cherry. Then moves into dark dried fruit territory with dates and raisins, marmalade. Cola and anise spice flavors emerge, and the whole package is back-dropped by brown sugar. Thickish but smooth body that is maybe a bit lighter than some other dubbels, moderate carbonation that allows the flavors to all peak though and overall impression is low-key sweet malts, fruit, and some unique spice flavors. Solid offering.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 09, 2013"

The dark fruits are rich but not too sweet and the brown sugar in this is terrific and restrained. The body of the beer is firm with plenty of bread and the lightness it has in the malt is deceptive to the palate. You are expecting a huge heavy sweetness and then it glides like as if on air instead. Worthwhile and smart.","utopiajane","Nov 16, 2013"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, spice, and dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid dark fruit and spice presence in the aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 02, 2013"

Aromas of raisin, prune, apple, caramel, toast, pepper, clove, banana, earth, candi sugar, molasses, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with nice complexity and balance. Taste of apple, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, clove, pepper, banana, earth, candi sugar, bread, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruit, caramel, toast, pepper, clove, banana, earth, candi sugar, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor complexity with good balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy, slick, and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel. Great complexity and balance of flavors; very smooth and crisp to drink.

It was defiantly hazelnut I was smelling because it hit the tongue like a freight train. There is some apricot and tartness on the sides of the tongue that add some balance to this sweet dubbel.

The taste is disappointing. The dubbel has a slight wine like grape characteristic and some light Belgian spice. The feel seems way off base for a dubbel. It is tart not velvety, no malt characteristics are popping through. The feel is moderate with appropriate carbonation. The finish is just wrong to me, way too tart and astringent. A sub par dubbel.

The taste is dark fruit flavor up front, followed by the malt sweetness, and ending with a hint of alcohol. Not the most complex tasting Belgian, but not bad. Good medium mouthfeel.

A quick waft of solvent - like fusels in aroma is immediately ensued by bright, citrusy fruit w/ a hint of spruce. The initial impression aromawise is that of Pine Sol, but as the beer breathes, hints of raisiny Special B and light chocolate malt provide contrast and depth. Yeast derived contributions in aroma are virtually absent, w/ bubblegum present only at a trace. In flavor, a snap of cider like tartness is perceived at first, then mellows into a somewhat understated combination of chocolate, dark, ripe fruity prune and vinous notes of fermented grapes w/ a pine undertone. Yeast esters flavorwise are very mild, and mirror the light bubblegum in aroma. Very dry, well attenuated and correspondingly light in body, w/ a spritzy mouthfeel from the high carbonation. (The mouthfeel was downright seltzer like and prickly for the first few minutes) Finishes dry, clean and a touch bland w/ a hint of yeast must. A bit of a dissappointment. Affligem Dubbel lacked complexity overall and was too "clean" and neutral esterwise. It was as if they fermented this brew with a neutral American ale yeast at a high temperature.","Maracuja","Sep 04, 2007"

Lots of apples in the nose, along with raisens, dried prunes, and a hint of hazelnuts. Mellow, slightly carbonated mouthfeel with dried fruit that lingers through to the finish. Ripe prunes, dired fruit, again apples and some pears in the mouth. More chestnutty flavor and walnuts than in the aroma. Modest alcohol, so minimal warmth as it goes down.

Mouthfeel is well carbonated, silky with a dry finish. Maybe a touch too dry but it offsets the silkiness nicely. The drinkability is good, although the dry finish may limit it a bit.

Tastes of cocoa, caramel, vinousness. Very sour at first, which makes me wonder if the bottle is a loss. I persevere, and find that the acid recedes with warming, improving the overall flavor. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but retains very nice carbonation, especially for its age. Very warming. Drinkability is average - the acidity, even as it warmed, detracted the most this, I think.

A massive pillar of spongy off-white head on the pour, large bubbles, went above and beyond the rim of the chalice, just kept rising. Serious head retention, some sticky traces of lacing here and there. The body is a deep mahogany, yet while held to the light it is a gorgeous cherry oak, intense carbonation action. Orange and coriander greet the nose at first, along with a mild malt backbone and some candy sweetness, along with rum soaked cherries and raisins. The alcohol presence is also apparent, it bombards the eyes while inhaling. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent, but watery at times, lacking in body. The flavour is incredibly mild, I was expecting so much more from the strong aroma, the malt tip-toeing through the tulips in the middle, most of the taste appears towards the finish, a rum raisin character with light fruit esters, and a wave of alcohol on the aftertaste. A light and smooth dubbel for the abv%, but flavour-wise it's more of a dud. Perhaps it's better caged and corked.

Flavor impression is fairly ordinary, sweet pear juice, brief impression of cocoa, slight vegetal leafiness and a bit of fizziness that seems a little wrong. Lightly astringent at the close, lemony.

3.58,-6.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The dubbel pours from the 330ml bottle an almost ruby coloured dark red. Very rich and full looking. The head, light brown, leaves screen lacing, or a circle of foam. The head is large bubbled at first, but becomes very creamy after a few minutes. The beer is translucent but substantially thick looking. The aroma, like Affligem's blond, is salty, with some sourness. Besides some more malt, I get very little difference between this and their blond ale. Roasted red malt aromas, aromatic spices, seasoning salt, and a hard water smell. Roasted nuts. A sour finish, like sweet bread. Red malt up front, and in the middle is the perfume taste. The phenols are there more obviously, though this is the exact same alcohol content as the blond. The subdued hops, noticeable in the aroma, are almost non-existent in the taste. The finish is dry, like barbeque sauce and spices. The lees, dark and caramel coloured, were sour and sweeter than the beer. This has a little more carbonation than the blond, which is in its favour. A little more watery than I expected, and not much of a change from their blond ale; though it does have more flavour. Above average drinkability for a dubbel. A malty offering. (Note: the 750 ml corked and caged version of the dubbel pours with a monstrous head with better retention. It is also somewhat sour, and less malty than the 330ml version. )","Cwrw","Dec 30, 2004"

3.63,-5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Half an inch worth of tightly packed, tiny beige bubbles sit atop the glass of mahogany liquid. Not much cling or lacing, but the head is bolstered by some very strong streamers. Beer is on the thin side in viscosity and sports good clarity. Smells slightly vinous and a touch sour right after opening the bottle. Out of the glass, pleasant light chocolate and almond are displaced by an off-putting smell of adhesive bandages. Nosefeel is so light as to be barely noticeable. Pouring the yeast helps to fortify the nuttiness and body, but it's just too little too late, I'm afraid. Individually, the flavors are quite nice: candy-apple sweetness at the tip of the tongue develops into a body of vinous dried cherry and butterscotch (accompanying the Band-Aid), with warmth bringing out peanut and rum raisin. However, the profile is odd--uncomposed--the flavors string out but don't tie back together. Mouthfeel is only slightly too thin but the extreme carbonation hits the palate like cola; crisp with a touch of oil. Good balance of buzz to soothing drinkability. Any flaws here aren't enough to totally defeat the brew; the worst aspect is probably its outlandish price tag.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Nov 22, 2004"

No sediment, even when held up to the light. Smell was fruity and biscuity, very good. Taste had a great deal of roasted malts, with a bit of tangy fruit as well.

Develops a bit of pruny fruitiness mid-palate, and ends with a bit of floral/herbal hop. Aftertaste is just slightly sour. Creamy mouth and pleasantly warming, with a low enough ABV to down the whole 750ml in one sitting. Not a terribly *deep* beer, but a undeinably solid one. Tasty and quite drinkable -- enjoy it with a meal and turn your non-BA friends on to some real beer.","mzwolinski","Feb 16, 2004"

Appears: This one Pours with excess foam when I popped the cork it had some umphhh to it, the actual body appears a murky mahogany tone with a massive tan head very amazing due to the head retention and massive thick chunky head just very nice lacing comes in thick evenly dispersed patches beautiful. Aroma: Of the glass without sediment poured in, vinous grapes, sweet sharp tones, mellow apple notes very complex and full of esters from the fruit scented phenols produced in fermentation. Glass with sediment poured in, glass claims a nutty aromatic profile is created let's see if I can detect it a deeper mustier but fuller scent both are exquisite but this one seems to be more balanced with the fruit still in existence I believe the yeast helps aroma here try it both though ways that's just my opinion. Taste: No sediment glass, very smooth carbonation tiny bubbles raisin, over ripened fruits like apples or figs here nice belgian candy sugar here, overall very nice and refreshing. There is definitely a difference to the one without sediment this one seems more robust to the palate with fruit not stealing the show, caramel roasted malts and deeper specialty malts make up a small percentage of the sweetness here, but there is a nut edge on the yeast profile not so much bready as usual but a very almond like flavor arises nice. Mouthfeel: Fluffy, creamy, medium bodied but light on the palate dessert like indulge and enjoy to the fullest, this is a beer that you can't believe the best before date completely b/c it's still amazing well past the suggested date.

A quick waft of solvent - like fusels in aroma is immediately ensued by bright, citrusy fruit w/ a hint of spruce.  The initial impression aromawise is that of Pine Sol, but as the beer breathes, hints of raisiny Special B and light chocolate malt provide contrast and depth.  Yeast derived contributions in aroma are virtually absent, w/ bubblegum present only at a trace.  In flavor, a snap of cider like tartness is perceived at first, then mellows into a somewhat understated combination of chocolate, dark, ripe fruity prune and vinous notes of fermented grapes w/ a pine undertone.  Yeast esters flavorwise are very mild, and mirror the light bubblegum in aroma.  Very dry, well attenuated and correspondingly light in body, w/ a spritzy mouthfeel from the high carbonation.  (The mouthfeel was downright seltzer like and prickly for the first few minutes) Finishes dry, clean and a touch bland w/ a hint of yeast must.  A bit of a dissappointment.  Affligem Dubbel lacked complexity overall and was too "clean" and neutral esterwise.
