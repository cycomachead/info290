3.91,0,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.5,4,"Small off white head on a beautiful ruby red brown body.  Aroma of toasted grain, raisins and lightly oxidized caramel.  Lots of toasty malt and raisins in the flavor with a lingering, oddly licorice note.  A fairly thin body with decent carbonation and a dry finish.  This bottle may have been a little on the old side, but nonetheless an unusually well made interpretation of the style for an American brewery.","nickfl","Sunday at 06:55 PM"

4.03,3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"To the beer: Deep brown, copper with a tight beige head that left some impressive lacing that lasted the entire glass. A subdued aroma where spice dominates the nose, some malty sweetness suggestive of dried fruit, and a hint of earthy yeast. The flavor expands greatly on the aroma. Spice becomes cinnamon, clove, pepper, with a dash of lemon zest. Dried fruit flesh out to dates, figs, and mainly raisin. Yeast maintains its earthy character. Certainly not as big as the Belgians that inspire this.","MisterGone","Jan 18, 2015"

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Got in a trade with swingracex. 750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/1/2012. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, fig, pear, apple, toast, clove, pepper, brown bread, candi sugar, molasses, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, pear, toast, clove, pepper, brown bread, candi sugar, molasses, chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, clove, pepper, toast, candi sugar, molasses, chocolate, brown bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, creamy, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel style! All around great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"a lovely dubbel, really. it pours a rich spiced rum color with a bone white head light as a cloud. the nose is straight raisins and booze, both of which I happen to enjoy. there is a nutty element to it as well, really earthy like a walnut, but mildly sweet like an almond. the flavor takes on more of a middle eastern flare than a Belgian one, with flavors of dates and figs, sweet and naturally complex, and the raisins are there too. I love the fact that this isn't as sweet and thick as some dubbels though, its quite drinkable for what it is. the body might be a little thin, but I appreciate the contrast to the rest of the genre, and the finish is fruity and quick, but not sugary or caramel heavy. the spice component is subtle, which I also like. good carbonation as well. overall an outstanding beer from the lost abbey, one im glad I got to try on tap. a very unique take on a dubbel, a welcome change.","StonedTrippin","Mar 19, 2013"

The flavor mimics the aroma quite well no surprises here. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel.

The aroma is that of malty sweetness, raisin, hint of the belgian yeast and earthy hops. The nose is sweet. The flavor follows suit with an initial malty sweetness. The light belgian character comes through as it warms. The raisin fruitiness begins to dominate the palette in the middle along with a mild bitterness. Finishes clean and smooth. Good carbonation. Overall, this is good but isn't my favorite. I had shied away from it so long due to the raisins, a flavor I don't care for. As such I found the flavor too powerful with the fruit, though this could be due to my preference.

I can tell that they spent a lot of time developing this beer, as the malt is very toffee centric, but it's not too sweet. And it definitely doesn't let the Belgian yeast turn that toffee into a tart, unpleasant taste that lingers in the back of your throat, like most other Dubbels. For this, I commend them. However, I would like to see some Belgian yeast, as that is one of my favorite flavors to enjoy. Seeing as how I didn't get that aforementioned unpleasantness in my throat, I have to overlook that. A good Dubbel, but could be a little more complex. I would reach for an Abbey Ale by New Belgium first, but this is second for American made Dubbels.","Philousa","Jan 02, 2012"

4.02,2.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"750 ml bottle, bottled on date of 11/23/10. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a murky ruby red/brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like dark fruit (mostly raisins, along with some cherries and figs), nuts, brown sugar and toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's a bit of spice noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a solid overall brew, and at $8.99 a bottle I'd buy it again the next time I see it. Certainly worth a try.","bluejacket74","Dec 02, 2011"

Early sweetness evaporates into dryness then leaving the impression of malt and fruit flavor but without the associated sweetness. A whimsical delight that finishes with the mild peppery bite of alcohol and black peppercorn. It certainly rivals authentic Belgain-brewed varieties such as Grimbergen Dubbel.","BEERchitect","Nov 29, 2011"

There are flavors of raisins, banana, fig, nutmeg, apple, chocolate, coffee, pear, malt, black pepper, lime peel, caramel, toffee, and licorice.

After a while brown sugar and cinnamon are discernible. The taste begins woody and spicy a lot like chewing on cinnamon bark sticks. Quickly the fruitier aspects of this beer make themselves known.

Dense, dark fruit tastes with caramel, however, there is a nice separation of the two and it avoids a "candy" flavor. Some occasional roasted malt and brown sugar taste pop in and out.

This is a more dusty dry spice feel though. There is a consistant dark fruit sweetness full of fresh raisens and plum on the back of the palate. This brew really does get better as it warms.

Some raisin and fig of course with a brown and candy sugar presence. Caramel and a light spice also apparent. Flavor is very rich when compared to the nose. Much more full than expected. Big and malty with the fruits and lots of caramel and brown sugar. Also some chocolate. Light yeast and spice with a slight alcohol burn as well. Creamy, full mouth with a spicy finish and a touch of alcohol again. Decent drinkability. Seems like an after dinner drink to me. Nothing spectacular here.","ncvbc","Oct 31, 2008"

The aroma is light, but there is some earthiness and a touch of chocolate. The taste is rich and chocolaty with typical Belgian yeast flavors of clove, herbal flavors, pear, and banana.

I really do wish I knew my spices better because I feel like I should be able to pinpoint this somehow. Flavor is smoothly sweet, though a tad of tang is there. Spices are clearly evident, but don't overpower. It's got some nice character to it. Feel has a fairly full carbonation and the liquid is decent. This is a pretty easy drinker. There is some good character on it and it's definitely not boring. Mind blowing? No. Nice to drink? Sure.","RblWthACoz","May 10, 2008"

4.17,6.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked up a bottle of this in light of the fact that I will be doing a trade soon for another Lost Abbey brew. Pour is interesting in that there is little to no heading, but the look of it is still worth noting. Looks very thick and murky. Color is a reddish brown. Aroma is sweet and spicy at the same time, with essences of dark stone fruits, cracked pepper, and an appealing boozy character. Taste really shows off the raisin puree created for this beer, with hints of chocolate and other fruits lingering in the background. Feel is on the medium side, and is just about right for this style. One bottle was far too easy to suck down. I like the fact that despite this is a sweet Dubbel, it is not overkill, with lots of other complexities to consider. A good American interpretation of this style. Bring on GOTM.","jamie2dope","Apr 22, 2008"

That's a good thing, just not too original (and a lot pricier from the Lost Abbey). The beer is dark brown colored, hazy, almost no head. The aroma is dark fruits (figs, plums, raisins) and some sweet esters. The taste is the same, possibly a hint of anise as well. The mouthfeel is thicker than water but not overly so, easily drinkable. Nice overall, but Ommegang is a better price and similar experience.","TurdFurgison","Mar 24, 2008"

3.65,-6.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"In both the flavor and aroma of this beer, I'm somewhat surprised to see so many distinct ingredients in other reviws. Unlike most Lost Abbey brews, I find this beer is decidedly "one-note." And that note is pureed raisins mixed with roasted malt. That's ... about it. Maybe a hint of something lighter, perhaps grapefruit or pine needles. Beer pours a pleasant enough reddish hue, but just not one of my favorites from Lost Abbey.","Overlord","Mar 03, 2008"

A faint floral perfume scent tickles the senses as well. Creamy dark fruits up front on the tongue: raisin, dates, plum, and cherries. Some biscuit flavors and walnuts as well. Caramel sweetness throughout with a mild vanilla aftertaste. Solid Belgian flavor brewed in the good US of A. Fluffy cloud mouthfeel with a smooth carbonation. Very close to the Westy 8 in texture, damn good. Amazing how this one goes down for 8%. Lost Abbey clearly knows what their doing, this is a damn fine beer.

It eventually settled to a ring and produced some sticky lace. The aroma was full of cakey, doughy malt and dried fruit - raisins mostly. There was also some yeast character and a bit of alcohol. The flavour was a combination of malt and fruit with a hint of alcohol, sort of like a fruitcake. It was quite bready with mild chocolate and cocoa notes, along with sweet prunes, cherries, and sultana raisins in the finish. Medium/light bodied with lowish carbonation, the bubbles were well-integrated and quite fine. The texture was quite good with a little warmth throughout. Very tasty overall. Even though the alcohol was always present, it was never distracting or hot. I really enjoyed the rich, dried fruit character too. Definitely a winner.","DrJay","Dec 18, 2007"

4.23,8.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a Chimay goblet. This beer pours a clear but dark brown, slightly red, with an airy but dense thick head. The head formed very easily on this. The smell is almost wine-like, probably because of the raisins. Alcohol might be there slightly. The taste is very good. Malty with a dark fruity sweetness at the start, finishing with an earthiness reminiscent of Belgian beers.","MiScusi","Aug 18, 2007"

4.28,9.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours medium to dark brown with a reddish hue. Foamy off-white head that starts off about an inch thick with very good head retention and an almost continuous lace up the back of the glass. The smell is lightly malty and sour with clear ripe fruit overtones, though I can't quite put my finger on a specific fruit. Also maybe a little bread in the nose. The taste is where this one really shines. Nicely balanced slightly bitter initial flavor that has the expected yeast sourness of a Belgian style ale. Interesting warm fruity aftertaste that reminds me of rum. The aftertaste morphs into a more sour malty flavor that is a little bitter. The only downside to this beer is the mouthfeel. It is nice and full-bodied, but I found it to be a little sudsy in texture, though it didn't bother me until I got to considering it for the review. Overall, this is a nice, complex beer that should definitely be tried. The yeast sourness and ripe fruit aromas and flavors are clear, but there is an interesting flavor/nose between initial flavor and aftertaste that I had trouble describing. Like every Lost Abbey brew I have had, this is well worth trying.","walshclimb","Aug 02, 2007"

Pours dark milk chocolate brown, moderate murkyness, with a mocha head, so so retention, minor film and next to no lacing. Seems to be quite low in the carbonation department. Nose here is of traces of chocolate, light raisins and perhaps some earthyness. Another simply delicious creation to savor. Light raisins, more chocolate, toffee, gingerbreddy malts, yum...complex, subtle,mellow, smooth, coating and highly enjoyable suds...another reason to move closer to Lost Abbey/Pizza Port and San Diego, Ca.","Billolick","Jul 24, 2007"

Simply, I wanted more of what the aroma brought to the table. The ABV is chunky and very warm, and does its part to limit the drinkability. It once was lost, and now it's found, I guess, and I'm okay with that, but I'm surely not awed.","Foxman","Jul 23, 2007"

Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt with candi sugar and some notes of dry figs and raisins are also noticeable. Body is quite full with some good carbonation and no alcohol was discernable.

3.55,-9.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The beer arrived in a 750 ml. Corked and caged bomber, and looked brownish orange in color when poured. The head atop it was beige, a little shy of two finger thick, and craggy. The smell was lighter than I was expecting, with a floral and soured fruit profile. The taste was sweet and rummy, and not quite as dry as the true Belgian examples I've sampled before. The carbonation was prickly in the mouth as result of the thinner than normal body, and the alcohol was also quite evident. Despite some of these flaws making this a little abnormal for the style, I found it was an overall enjoyable beer.","rajendra82","Apr 14, 2007"

This is one of the best smelling beers yet, with banana bread hitting you right away, followed by malts and brown sugar. This beer could be made into incense...Tasted of dark fruits (the raisin mixture they add contributes to some great flavoring) malt, and again, subtle hints of brown sugar and fresh wheat bread. The mouth feel was fairly substantial, but the beer is so good that two 22oz bottles wouldn't be a problem. Pairs with the usual dubbel suspects- mild flavorful cheeses- though it would be a great after dinner finisher...Enjoy","Greenfloyd","Feb 19, 2007"

The aroma is funky, sour, horse blanket, caramel, vanilla, some pepper, and nice herbal spices throughout the nose. The taste starts sweet upfront, caramel, malt bomb, dark pitted fruit, plums, raisins, followed by a sour unripened twang in the finish. This overall beer is good, a little alcohal strong for 7% that could mellow possible with age.","Franchise","Feb 09, 2007"

Aroma is sweet and spicy, with sedate dark fruitiness. Taste is malty upfront, with spicing coming on strong in the middle, carrying on to the close, where the fruit enters the picture as well. Mouthfeel seems carbonated to a fault, hard to get a handle on the flavors around all the bubbles on the tongue, and reasonably nice and drinkable. Not quite what I was hoping for, but still a sturdy representative of the style.","ppoitras","Dec 12, 2006"
