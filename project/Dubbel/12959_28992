3.07,-19.4,3.75,3,3,3.25,3,"Dark brown pour, with a large off-white head that retained nicely and coated the glass with lace. Mild aroma of bready yeast and caramel malts. Taste was very bland up front, cardboardy malts, yeast, light herbal hop notes, no real sweetness or estery qualities that I like in the style; it was really just pretty lacking in taste, though benign and mostly non-offensive. Could've just been that the bottle was past its prime, but I don't see why a beer like this couldn't hold up a year or two in the cellar. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Pretty average overall, not very tasty, but not undrinkable.","Rifugium","Feb 22, 2014"

2.93,-23.1,3.5,3,2.5,4,3,"Captain Lawrence St. Vincent's Dubbel pours a very dark and deep purple, with very faint ruby highlights. There's about a finger of tan foam sitting atop the beer, and its dissipation is a slow one. Lacing is essentially nonexistent though. The nose is surprisingly buttery. There are some plum and clove present, but they are by far secondary aromas. The flavor brings more of the same. If anything, there's more of a buttery, toffee presence than in the nose. It tastes like a bunch of English brown ale got poured into my dubbel. Once again the dark fruit and spicy phenol notes can be found, but they are a bit tough to appreciate underneath all the sweetness. The mouthfeel is a touch rich, but the carbonation is nice and bubbly. It's not that I didn't enjoy what was in my glass, it's just that I ordered a beer called St. Vincent's Dubbel, and what I got isn't much of a dubbel.","axeman9182","Oct 13, 2011"

Pours nice hazy reddish orange color with a fairly dense 2 finger khaki head with amazing retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap. Some bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Tons of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Aromas of huge grape juice, raisin, molasses, caramel, chocolate, nuttiness, and spices. Huge aromas here I could smell as soon as I poured it. Nice stuff. Taste of big white grape, caramel, toasted malt, pepper, spices, bread, and molasses up front; with some chocolate and nutty notes near the finish. A slight bit of tartness in the back adds a different aspect to this, with lingering notes of chocolate, nuttiness, spices, molasses, and caramel. Finish is excellent, not too dry, leaving a nice amount of linger flavors. Nice balance of flavors as well. Alcohol is nicely hidden with none noticed except for a small warming on the finish. Great drinkability. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice and creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is definitely an outstanding dubbel with tons of flavor and great balance. This improved a lot as it warmed up.","superspak","Aug 08, 2011"

3.65,-4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The palate is a bit of a strange beast. Opening fruity, tart and vinous, there's a suggestion of an accidental inoculation of souring culture, with a blend of lactic sourness and a very earthy, leathery Brett character. This renders the fruity and the malt character secondary, but it also does help in drying this beer out. There's a definite plum character, as well as a blend of spices with anise and a little black cardamom, there's also a very nice flavor of toffee, cocoa and burnt sugar. Drying and tart with a little bit of leather and spice on the finish, this is quite enjoyable. Light in body and excessively carbonated, this is highly unusual for the style, but still, very enjoyable as a beer, especially when colder. As it warms up, it does grow increasingly disjointed, but I am going easy on my scores here.","DefenCorps","Dec 17, 2010"

Nose reveals hops, nutmeg, coriander and a peppery quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, some chocolate, prunes and an earthy quality comes out, with hops bittering at the finish.

4.18,9.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a ruby brown color with a nice puffy tan head that settles into a nice cap. The aroma is sweet with candi sugar, and a bit metallic or rusty from the dark belgian malt. The flavor is a nice mix of belgian candi sugar, a slightly nutty toasted malt and some raisin/fig fruitiness. Everything is in balance, one of the better dubbels that I have had in a long while. A moderate body with very fizzy carbonation, starts off sweet but actually finishes dry. One of the better dubbels that I have had, either US or Belgian. Seems to hit the style head on. This is very nice.","Gmann","Jul 15, 2009"
3.53,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Growler from Bellport Beer & Soda (2009 batch). Pours a deep cloudy brown with no head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, spices (allspice, pepper, cinnamon, clove), and light roasted malt. Flavor of sweet malt and yeast with a roasty, spicy finish. Some smoked/charred malt notes too. From my recollection of last year's batch, this doesn't seem as complex. It's a touch sweet and weaker in the palate. Maybe it's the tap vs. bottle difference, I dunno, but I'm not loving it as much as I did last year.","LilBeerDoctor","Jul 07, 2009"

Smell is interesting, lots of apple, some brown sugar/caramel sweetness, pears, lightly yeasty, some biscuit, apple juice, apricots, very fruity, pretty cool. Taste is weird, lots of apple and pear, juice, some caramel sweetness, lots of toast and biscuit, yeast, alcohol, some sour oakiness, pretty interesting. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, a bit thin in the mouth and the carbonation is a bit tough to take. Kind of thin and lightly sour, but I didn't mind drinking it.

3.73,-2.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep brown, with a red hint to it. Large, dense tan head resting atop. A sweet malt smell with the definitive Belgian yeast providing a dark fruit hint. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there is a bit of an alcohol or tartness to the smell. This carried through in the flavor, as well. A rich caramel sweetness upfront that is followed by that tart back end. Maybe I want to say a spicy finish to it, because the alcohol is not so high to cause that sensation in my mouth. A bit tart as it rests in your mouth, that spiciness, I guess you could say. There is a nice warming effect as you enjoy it. Definitely a nice sipping beer, with a few different things going on in it. The alcohol may be a little too apparent for my taste.","bhalter8","May 18, 2009"

I was hoping to find a home brewed (Cap't Lawrence is about 15 miles away) Belgium that I would really enjoy but I was disappointed. Flavor wise it was close but something was missing - it really didn't have that rich, deep taste a true Belgim dubbel has.","DooDahDan","Aug 01, 2008"

An aggressive dark fruit and sweet earthy aroma highlighted with a spicy coriander character. Well carbonated, the tongue immediately becomes preoccupied with a spicy tingle and sense of the alcohol. For me, most of the flavor was sensed in the back and with the swallow and finishing breath. Quite a bit more spicy than fruity, but the flavor does linger well giving it a lot to consider.

While the aroma is not overly so, the flavor definitely has some heavy spiciness to it (though I wouldn't guess this is anything more than fermentation character). Fairly rich tasting, yet the overall experience of this beer remains surprisingly light. Either Dubbels are finally beginning to grow on me (Dubbels have been one of the few Belgian Styles I have not really been exited about), or this is just enough different from the typical example that I am really enjoying this right now.","Gueuzedude","Sep 04, 2007"

It has a sweet, malty flavor that boasts of roasted and caramel malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry with a nice warming effect. There is a mild yeast fruitiness that blends well with the crystal malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious beer.

The finish is a bit rough, at 8% it is not too hot and the overall mouthfeel is young and a bit raw for a dubbel.

Taste is hearty grain flavors upfront, seguing nicely into the dark fruity sweetness in the middle, and then alcohol warmth turns on the afterburners. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little lacking the carbonation area, and drinkability is somewhat limited by the alcohol, which seems to feel stronger than the advertised 8%abv.

Nose is softly of toffee and abit of musty funk is picked up. This is a smooth, tasty and well crafted Belgian Dubbel style ale. Rich notes of more toffee, rum, raisins, smokey chocolate. Complex flavors and sensations entice the senses, soft and inviting mouthfeel, with a nice warming alcohol feel in the finish. Scott does not miss a beat and this is an instant favorite.
