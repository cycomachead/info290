This one looked decent in the glass but it went downhill from there.  I have had this one in the fridge for a long time.  I kept passing it over in fear that I would not like it.  I was right.  The Belgian flavor profile just doesn't work for me.  Lesson learned.","fscottkey","Mar 29, 2015"

Add some caramel(?) & dried fruits, make it super smooth, warming, full bodied. Noticed a little spice but that seems to take a back seat after a few sips. Finishes dry, like it's supposed to. Alcohol strength doesn't show until later, and then it grabs you, so you grab another. Dang, this is good! Another great one by Ommegang.","gotweid","Dec 23, 2014"

3.5,-15.9,,,,,,"	This is the first Dubbel I've reviewed and quite possibly the first one I'll have ever tried in my life... Certainly the first of it's style since I've become more interested in craft beers, and coincidently it's also the first beer that Ommegang officially brewed... I was going to get a foreign Dubbel, but I'm much more a fan of American sbeers (at the present time) so I chose the domestic route, and having seen PLENTY of good remarks about Ommegang's Farmhouse Ale, I figured that'd be a decent choice for a Dubbel...  Also, since their specialty is Belgian style brews, it seemed fitting that they be my brewery of choice in trying this Abbey Ale... It poured what seemed to be a medium bodied beer that had an extremely vigorous 3 inch rusty colored head with some pretty decent sized bubbles within it...  The head dissipated rather quickly though, leaving behind a touch of lacing and not very much of a cap, but the hazy red hue is a beautiful tone with quite a bit of opaqueness to it... The aroma present on the nose immediately is the almost raisiny malty sweetness, with a bit of molasses and spice, as well as a  touch of bread/wheat in there also... A very strong nose on this brew, not aromatically challenged in the slightest... The first taste is full of the dark berry sweetness of malts, while the spiciness of the beer gently tiptoes on your palate as well... After a few sips and letting the beer set a moment as I wrote this, the licorice became more pronounced with the passing of time... The finish is pretty crisp and somewhat drier than the rest of the beer's elements, this is also where you'll taste some faint bread elements, but the berry flavors are still the most prominent...  The mouthfeel has a medium fullness to it, with the effervescence giving it a creamy mouthfeel... Overall, pending this is a good representation of this style, the beer was crafted well,with a decent amount of complexity to it... I would have preferred a bit more spice in place of the fruitiness that's contained within this beer, but regardless what I would have done it's far from a one note song... That being said, I wasn't overly impressed with this beer, but that could simply be that this is mores not my favorite STYLE of beer, as the flavors all worked well with each other and were in good balance... Another good brew - Cheers!!","NSXAG","Nov 01, 2014"

My first impression was a slight sourness, which unto itself was surprising. The label lists many flavors the only ones that came through were some licorice root...deep on the tongue...& some burgundy notes. Rereading the ingredients, I think I should use this in a daube de boeuf. I will say that the 8.2% ABV was undetectable. Points for effort but just not for me.","seedyone","Aug 30, 2014"

APPEARANCE: as the label suggests, dark burgundy body; thick, stable single-finger off-white head; limited lacing... AROMA: deep plum and floral hops; coriander and citrus heighten the aroma; lilac and honey hover late--delectable... PALATE: big, full-bodied and demanding of attention; creamy and enjoyable (almost like a warm milkshake) with every sip... TASTE: some iron and wine to start; soft plum and coriander; medium hops and solid malts form a balanced flavor profile; some berry accents late--complex and rewarding... OVERALL: first, the LBJ parallels: both are worth the money, both are well-built, comfortably strong (8.2% ABV), agile, and absurdly smooth, both are versatile when pairing with other food/players, and both are winners...I had almost forgotten how good this beer is...","dacrza1","Jul 16, 2014"

This beer came off as tasting like root vegetables with potato and turnip. The sweetness of the chocolate malt flavor and the twang of the licorice with vegetable notes just didn't go together. Licorice and anise spice lingered long after. There were other redeeming qualities like a great body and a nice porter-like woodiness that I appreciated, but I couldn't get past the bad parts. And I'm even a fan of licorice an anise, just not in my beer apparently.","constantine_272","Apr 10, 2014"

Smell is sweet dark fruit, raisins, booze, dried fruit, sweet bread, and some attenuated belgian yeast aroma. Taste is spicy; big sweet malt, with dark fruits. Cherries and raisins abound, with spice notes from the brewing spices (which the bottle lists as coriander, cumin, licorice, star anise, and orange peel). Very carbonated, which contributes to a huge creamy mouthfeel that is just awesome. Overall I think the carbonation mutes the flavors a bit, and I prefer Three Philosophers to this, but it's a great beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 11, 2013"

It's easy to kick back with a few of these at once, even though the alcohol would become apparent after a short while. The oily coating that this left behind on my mouth was so subtle and slick that I could have gotten hooked on that alone but there's a good reason why this has so many positive reviews on here - this was great from start to finish and worthy of its lofty rating on here. A must-try for any Belgian beer lover and those who doubt that an American-brewed offering can match up with overseas counterparts.","JerzDevl2000","Jun 17, 2013"

4.2,1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/10/2012. Pours very hazy and cloudy deep ruby red color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, fig, molasses, banana, brown bread, clove, light pepper, floral, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, apple, prune, fig, molasses, toast, banana, candi sugar, clove, floral, light pepper, light chocolate, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, molasses, toast, banana, candi sugar, light clove, floral, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel style. Great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester notes with malt balance; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2013"

The flavors aren’t overwhelming, but nicely balanced and cleverly subtle, providing new nuances with every mouthful. One of the beer’s only weak points is the massive level of carbonation; I’ve had champagnes with fewer bubbles than this, and the beer literally foams up in the mouth and fills the stomach with air. Had I a second bottle, I would let it sit open for a few minutes before taking my first sip. Other than that, you’re not going to find much better Trappist-style ale anywhere.","jondeelee","Apr 05, 2013"

The aroma holds sweet malts of caramel and toffee with a huge expression of what a Belgian yeast strain can bring to a beer. Bubble gum, bready, Vegemite, with a hint of pepper round out the nose nicely. The flavor is sweet malts up front with brown sugar, toffee, and a hint of honey. Light dark fruits with all the yeastiness provides a great balance to the sweet malt. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel.

I found the flavors played nicely off of each other and the alcohol really integrated into the beer for a smooth drinking brew.","spoony","Dec 23, 2012"

I see that this Ommegang Abbey Ale has been reviewed many times, and I hesitate to review one of our fine beverages that so many others have disected and nearly unanimously enjoyed, but this beer is special, a fine dubbel. The flavors have hints of so many real and imagined fine assets, banana, caramel, molasses, alcohol even citrus. It's all in there, waiting to be released and enjoyed. On any given day, this beer can deserve a 100 score, but that would be perfect, and until you try it I'll leave perfection at 98 and I would be happy to try again, and again, and again to find perfection, but Ommegang has found a close fly by to the magical elusive perfection.","JimTeal","Nov 27, 2012"

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A great beer! Smell is malty, with hints of caramel, banana and nuts; a bit spicy too, typical of many Belgians. Tastes boozy yet smooth. I get dark fruits, but also orange, caramel, and spices. Carbonation mellows as the beer warms. Overall, a superb dubbel brewed in the Belgian tradition by an American brewer.","BigTuna","Aug 30, 2012"
3.95,-5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall this is a good Belgian dubbel but by no means my favorite. Fairly dark fruit forward with emerging alcohol and a strong yeasty spice. I bet all these flavors would mellow out with age but there are also higher quality examples worthy of cellar space. Good, not great, worth a try to emerging fans of the style for availability and fair price point.","claspada","Aug 30, 2012"

Delicious aroma of caramel malts, dark fruit and Belgian spicing. Typical Belgian flavors, dark fruit, orange, spicy. High carbonation leaves a dry, slightly astringent flavor. Somewhat sour, dry fruit finish. A bit on the dry side for my taste in dubbles, but well made and pleasant to drink. Medium bodied.","LiquidAmber","Aug 07, 2012"

A cap of head retains forever and leaves some on the side of the glass during consumption. The beer has the typical Belgian dubbel smell. It has the smell of dark candi sugar, Belgian yeast, malt, and dark fruits. The beer tastes like an authentic Belgian dubbel. There are the bready malts, dark candi sugar, dark fruits (prune and raisin), and Belgian yeast flavors that really come through without tasting too heavy. This is superb. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste as well. The body is full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and dry in the finish. This is an excellent beer and the best American made dubbel I've ever tried.","acevenom","Jul 22, 2012"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and some spice aromas. Taste is slightly tart with toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and spice flavors with the dark fruits coming through more on the finish. There is a pretty high amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I was not expecting the sour flavor and the high spice bitterness on the finish. However, this is still a solid beer.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 04, 2012"

The head is a dark khaki, about 2 fingers, and leaves delicate lacing. The nose of this beer is the highlight of this experience. It is full of red licorice, cherries, roasted malts, and toffee. I spent almost twenty full minutes just smelling the beer. The mouthful was very full with a dry aftertaste that really clears off the palate.

Pouring a deep ruby, almost mahogany, this brew features a thin, off-white head and decent lacing. A powerful bouquet of dark fruit (figs, plums, and raisins) mixes with licorice and chocolate hints. All sorts of flavors erupt on the pallet, including Belgian candi sugar, fig, honey, licorice, and more dark fruits.

Tulip glasses not recommended go for a goblet shape. The aroma is powerful and mirrors the taste. The Ommegang bowls you over with flavor of burnt sugar and oxidized wine. No subtle mix of complex flavors here. Overall I did not like the flavors of this Dubbel, and I would prefer a more subtle presentation. The Ommegang is worth a try to experience how intense a Dubbel can be, but I will not repeat as there are other offerings which provide a more subtle array of flavors to the palate.","iSip","Feb 20, 2012"

3.92,-5.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I ate dinner with some family on Saturday night at The Elephant Walk in Brookline, and was surprised to see a decent draft lineup here. I started with an Abbey Ale. It was served in an Ommegang-branded stemmed tulip glass. Dark brown color with a slim white head on top. Aroma was rich with cherry, plum, and red licorice. Taste was also quite delicious. Ripe, dark fruit really stood out as potent flavors. It was also sweet at the end, like they used Belgian sugar to brew. Mouthfeel was a slight bit hot from the alcohol at the end of the sip. This is a surprisingly boozy beer. It's been a long time since I've had the Ommegang dubbel, and I almost forgot just how good it really is.","morebeergood","Oct 24, 2011"

Head retention was average and it produced decent lacing. The aroma was full of sweet malt, caramel and prunes. The taste of this ale has a strong malt base, it is sweet, creamy, and has a raisiny and spicy notes. The beer was sweet from start to finish. Awesome beer, best American version of a Belgian Dubbel that I have tasted thus far.","GossageBrewery","Aug 13, 2011"

The beer smells about like a I expect a dubbel to smell. The flavor is more of the same. I get some dark fruit (mainly cherries and plums) as well some Belgian yeast and some brown, candy sugar notes. There is a little bit of alcohol noticeable but the beer is still easy to drink.

4.18,0.5,5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beauty appears a deep reddish-brown color, perhaps mahogany (or the color of maple sap) under a creamy and fully committed head. A generously deep bouquet of toasted candied maple, brown sugar, and caramel cookies with notes of ginger and raisin fills the nose. Body is a full yet relatively smooth one. The malt-centric taste notes here are very much foretold by the aroma but do finish differently with a more herbal and earthy tone than the expected fully sweet one. With its ending carbonation, the finish is also slightly reminiscent to that of the caramel-noted cola finish in a soda.","albertjr21","Aug 07, 2011"

The aroma has a wonderfully fragrant combination of wine grapes, candied plums, and dark brown sugar. The flavor is likewise rich and complex, with notes of leather, rum-soaked cherries, raisins, brown sugar, and some deep underlying earthiness. The fine, active carbonation creates a texture that is both prickly and creamy.

3.6,-13.5,4,4,3,4,4,"O: This beer isnt my favorite from the guys at Ommegang. Its high notes are the texture, look and smell.

Scent is a blend of brown sugar, plum, raisin with touches of citrus, mellon and banana - a lot going on here. Taste mimics scent, with all of those different notes going on, it was really hard to appreciate as it came off as unfocused. Body is fuller side of medium, creamy but with highly active carbonation, lingering burnt sugar and alcohol flavors on the tongue.

The head is frothy and just about four fingers in size. The head stays around at about one finger and leaves a little lace. The aroma is of belgian candy, very sweet and inviting with a slight earthiness at the very back end. Very strong aroma that you can smell as you come close to the glass. The taste follows suit, there is a sweet malt backbone with a very nice candy yeast flavor. There is also a slight dark fruit presence and a slight balance of earthy hops at the back end. The mouthfeel is very carbonated.

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a cloudy copper-brown with a small beige head that dissipates quickly. Dark sugars in the aroma, with dried fruits, and sweet malts.

Complex and flavorful, well-balanced, medium-bodied, and a pleasant drink.","Rifugium","May 22, 2011"

4.03,-3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I was struck first by the head, which was plentiful and sticky. The color is a light brown with tints of orange. I did not get an overwhelming taste of caramel, but I did find a faint taste of fruit. It was somewhat sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The thing I was struck by most was the carbonation, which was noticeable and lasting. Overall, despite the alcohol content, I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I sometimes am with Say Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA.

Also some spices peaking through in the finish(i.e. cloves). Most of the flavor lingers on the back of the palate with a heavy feel and medium carbonation.

Smells of sweet dark fruits, dates, figs, lite chocolates, grapes, plum, apples. Strong pungent belgian yeast presence, as would be expected with a fine Dubbel. A taste similar to a dark red wine, very sweet and dry, extremely complex. Rich fruits, tart sugars, a hop bitterness on the end, thick heavy spice presence to boot. Very dry and sugary on the tongue, a nice sweetness that opens up all the taste buds. This is a fantastic world class beer. Cheers.","gabedivision","Apr 18, 2011"

4.7,13,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Four finger medium foam head of light brown. Lace is dense but very little cling. Color is a 29 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is a wonderful complex venue of fragrances. There are scents of plum, honey, pepper, ginger, peach, cinnamon, toffee, roasted wheat, and malt. Flavor is just as complex as the smell, with tastes of honey, roasted coffee, toffee, plum, raisins, dark chocolate, green apple, black pepper, cinnamon, and a light taste of lime. Mouthfeel is very creamy, smooth and has a snappy crispness. Great beer overall, will buy this again and recommend it to my deep beer friends.","beerprovedwright","Mar 31, 2011"

Dark fruit, caramel, and a subtle spice all play in the flavor. Light/medium mouthfeel with a pretty lively level of carbonation.

As it is, it is pretty decent as I am half way through the bottle and I can think of just about any other Dubbel I would rather have than this one. I guess this would be an alright one to follow up an Imperial Stout or something that was more roasty, but as a first beer, it was a bit of a shocker to the system for too long in the session for my taste.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 07, 2011"

Pours a mostly clear, deep reddish mahogany body with a two-finger width, fizzy, tan head that dissipated quickly leaving some nice lacing that stuck around. Very nice vinous aroma. Berry honey, raisin, a light toffee bread malt, and some softly spiced yeast. The flavor is more malt based than the aroma, but still maintains a bit of a vinous quality. Starts with some toasted caramels and a bit of bubbly berry taste. Lots of raisins and some more toasty caramels come in during the middle while still maintaining a soft, bubbly carbonation. Some candy licorice, slightly tart dark fruits, yeast, and banana bread come in during the finish where it dries at a nice pace. Sweet aftertaste that lingers with a touch of chocolate, raisin, toasty caramel, vinous fruits, and a light spicing. Palate is full and creamy with a nice, soft carbonation throughout.

4.45,7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Ommegosh, Ommegang is one of my new favorite beers. Upon pouring the beer, very nice head with beautiful yeasty smells arising from the glass. Nice dark color but the flavor isn't overwhelming as many stouts and porters. The smell makes you think it will be overly sweet but I think it offers subtle raisin and plum background with a clove-like nip on the tongue. The mouthfeel is what separates this beer from many other Abbey styles, very silky but not overly coating. The carbonation cleanses as it passes over the tongue. All in all, a delicious, hearty beer from our friends at Ommegang. Nice work!!","webdog76","Jun 01, 2010"
3.93,-5.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer pours a dark brown with a crimson/redish hue and a lot of foam to top it off (about 3 fingers worth). It is an aesthetically pleasing beer in my opinion, but that's just a personal preference and you can only do so much nit-picking in this category. On the nose, I get sort of a musty, old liquorice mixed with some dark fruits like plums or raisins, possibly cherries too. It's pretty complex for a Belgian-style Dubbel so it was rather difficult to pinpoint all the nuances in this one (in fact, a re-review may be in the works for this reason). The alcohol is definitely present, but not entirely overpowering either; there's a decent balance of taste and spicyness on the palate. There's some maltyness here no doubt, along with hints of nutmeg, caramel, and maybe even tobacco. I would say it's a heavier beer. I believe this beer would make a great pairing for a nice cut of meat, like a steak or some pork chops perhaps. The mouthfeel was slightly bitter at first impression, but this beer definitely grows on you and that bitterness quickly dissipates into a sweeter full-bodied beer. In terms of drinkability, I would like to have this beer occasionally, probably with an entrée or even a dessert, but not so much of an everyday type of beer. However, it suffices to say this beer could be had at anytime or anyplace with enjoyment, but better suited to the occasion of fine dining.","Nightwielder","May 29, 2010"

Doesn't smell as complex as I had hoped (though the nose is still good), a clove spiciness from the yeast really dominates. Thankfully, the Ommegang Abbey Ale's taste has more layers to it. The previously noted yeasty contributions are there, along with some alcohol soaked dark fruits (raisins come to mind first) and just a hint of caramel sweetness lurking in the background. The beer is nicely carbonated and has a suitably full body, though I wish it was a little more rich. 8.5%? Could have fooled me, no booziness to this beer whatsoever.

An orange taste is followed by something that's like over ripe banana and barnyard funk, and also a spice and tart layer underneath all this. Cherries seem to be pretty strong at the first hit or flavor, but subside as the profile lingers. There is also a bit of sherry red wine, but it's real slight. That being said the booze is untraceable in this which I really like. The mouth feel is full enough, I know what I'm drinking is far from watery. I want to say I also taste tea and something very like lemon as well. This is a beer that comes into focus as I continue with it; the malt contains caramel and chocolate without being overt with either of those flavors.

The aroma is an appetizing balance of wheat, caramel malts, and yeast with only a hint of alcohol in the distance. A well-bodied mouthfeel keeps me interested.

Lots of sweet dark fruit aromas, with a nice bready yeast in the background. Also picking up quite a bit of alcohol as well. Taste closely follows the nose. Nice fruity flavors, like plum and fig.

Demand became so overwhelming that in 2003 Brewery Ommegang was sold to the Belgium brewery responsible for Duvel Golden Ale and now Ommegang brews are made both in Belgium and Cooperstown. This particular brew is made in Belgium is the first beer produced by Ommegang and was inspired by the ales produced by the Belgium Trappist monks. This beer pours nicely into a dark red brown color with a nice fat foamy head. The aromas are full of Belgium yeast as well as some fruity and nutty notes.

Taste now.. great mouthfeel and body to this one, very smooth and creamy going through the mouth. Again, some raisin/fig type of flavors with a sort of spicy finish.. finishes a bit dry for my liking but for its ABV it's way too drinkable.

I really love the color of the beer, but desired a thicker head to round off the appearance. The smell was very good! Mix of a little tartness, maybe citrusy with something sweet hiding in the background. Couldn't quite put my tongue (nose) around it though. Initial pour into the mouth brought a real fruity palate. Swishing it around really changed the taste. Stronger on the tip, a little sweeter near the back. What I really liked, though, was the carbonation. This beer really danced around on my tongue, which I quite enjoyed. The alcohol felt a little too prominent, though.

Dates, raisins, and plums were most prevalent. The silky smooth mouthfeel was fantastic and carbonation was spot on. I liked that this was a little less sweet than other dubbels I've had.

There is some toffee and licorice but tons of malt here, brown sugar, sweetness in a medium body drinkable brew.

Mixture of fresh black fruits and glazed fruits in the nose, more raw brown sugar than manipulated sweetness, maybe some fresh honey, the roasted malts build as it warms, scents more smooth than invasive. Medium-bodied, very balanced for its weight, gives it a semi-relentless character. Here the red cherry, raspberry, golden raisin flavors ring more clearly, not fruity per se but you'd have to be a moron not to taste the fruit. As a result, the roast is sweeter with more caramel notes. Carbonation level is average, more upfront, dies off.

A solid brown color gives way to shafts of ruby and amber, each containing a defining characteristic of the beer. Once this ceiling is broken though, it's like biting into a piece of fleshy fruit - dry, but growing juicy, seemingly filling your mouth with carmelized sweetness.

A caramel, raisin sweetness on the nose and the initial taste was one of sweet raisins and yeast very much in the forefront, really dominating the malt and hops. Maybe a little roasted malt in there.

As the bubbles pop and the head slowly fades, a craggly lacing is left behind. Nose is somewhat unique and spicy, with raisins, sugar, and notes of taffy present. Tastes of dark fruits and a bit grainy at first with an earthy essence mixed into the equation. A slight, but lingering bitterness resolves things in the end. This one isn't too big on the carbonation, with only a slight burst of bubbles upon a good shake.

A thick lace of foam retains with the beer long after the pour. Giving the beer a swill, more volatiles are released, evoking the sweet aromas of banana and fruit pie. Taste produces a mouthful of wonderful flavor, fruits, spices and hops abound the palate with a slight alcohol-heavy aftertaste. As the beer warms to room temperature, the sweetness of the beer becomes alive, producing an entirely different feel and texture. The one downside of this ale is its 8.5% ABV on what is a dangerously drinkable beer. Overall a fine specimen and another reason why Ommegang continues to live up to all the hype.","rpgman456","Oct 18, 2008"

Its neutral the way that Guinness is neutral to an experienced drinker. If you are not a fan of the general style then its a strong flavor but i just expect more character then this from an abbey ale. There is a slight after taste of pennies, which is annoying but even that is so faint its nearly not there. Its very drinkable, because its neutral, but not actually good. Have it with food instead of diet soda.","vegasennui","Oct 15, 2008"

Feel is a tiny bit on full the side of medium and a little sticky. I am consistently impressed with Ommegang. I tried all of their beers at a festival once, but it was late and inappropriate setting experience the magnificence of this brewery. It's since I've joined BA that I've really gotten into these beers. Hennepin is a staple in my kitchen now, and I've had fun with Three Philosophers too, (had some with sweet potato fries once, great pairing!).

Complex flavors of toffee, floral hops, alcohol notes and a long finish that ends on a caramel note. Truly a layered beer. Great balance, medium/light carbonation.

Bar stocks a good selection of NY beers on tap and bartender is quite knowledgeable. Beer was capped nicely by a light tan/toffee toned head that left very appealing lacing. The beer displays a lovely reddish-amber hued tone. The nose is fantastice. Dried fruits, some Belgian yeasts, spicy, black pepper-clove like, touch of malty sweetness in there to balance the aroma out. Flavor is awesome as well. Dried fruits agains, cloves,malts, yeasty, slightly sweet on the taste, but cut perfectly by a great dryish finish of alcohol and spice.

The taste is very good, malt flavors are real clear, sweet flavor. Also there is a fruit like flavor hiding in there that seems to come out as the brew warms which ties it self to a more pronounced alcohol flavor.

The head is a craggy rocky fortress of cream-colored bubbles. The smells are like squeezed grapes, wine, alcohol, raisins and I find myself sniffing away as I sip. The flavor is strong, some raisins, long aftertaste of licorice and a slight tinge of alcohol. I think the mouthfeel is really smooth but the beer does coat your mouth thoroughly.

The taste followed afterward. It was incredibly sweet and almost unbearable to finish the whole thing.

It has a bitter component that comes on towards the end, just before a very dry finish. Interesting but not what I expected of an abbey style ale. Mouthfeel has nice carbonation and an oily texture that ties it together well. Drinkability is good, although the overroasting & the dry finish keep it from being really outstanding.

I couldn't put my finger on the exact fruit flavors in the smell and taste, but I'm thinking it was a darker berry, like grapes or cherries. A well carbonated beer, which balances the heavier tastes.

Some mild, vague fruitiness. Alcohol stands out. Flavors come out very fruity in the front with hints of banana, apple, and grape. Middle mellows out with the fruit and the alcohol comes in. Finishes dry with some astringency from the roasted malt. Aftertaste is roasted malt and dark dried fruits. Mouthfeel is not cumbersome and the carbonation makes the flavors feel lively on the tongue. Solid take on a Belgian, but really not the most interesting beer made in the Belgian vein.","goochpunch","Mar 27, 2007"

The beer is a dark brown-amber color with a thick brown-cream colored head that leaves small gatherings of lacing around the glass. The smell is quite sweet and complex, some wine characteristics; mostly malt. Fruitiness, possibly raisins or dates, Belgian sugars and alcohol are all apparent in the smell. The taste is also very wine-like, with a warming effect from the alcohol. A bit of spiciness complements the Belgian sugars and helps cover the alcohol slightly. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite a bit of bubbly, creamy carbonation. The overall drinkability of this beer is pretty good but I think I would try to stick to a single 750 ml bottle. The alcohol does hurt the drinkability of this beer slightly.","gmfessen","Mar 23, 2007"
4.2,1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a dark reddish brown with exciting carbonation and frothy head. Aromas were of sweet malts, dark dried fruits and definite spiciness. Yeasts were there but not overpowering. Brew was light in mouthfeel, though it had layers of flavor- great yeasty spices, cloves, sweet cinnamon. Malty finish, and very very dry. Carbonation was aggressive throughout, making the beer seem lighter while allowing more flavors to come through. The high abv was extremely well hidden, but after two 12 oz bottles i could feel the warming effects. Very good effort, Ommegang is on the top of the list of american craft brewers as far as belgians go.","kernalklink","Mar 23, 2007"

Sweet, dark fruit scents as well as banana. Caramel and maybe some chocolate cherries. I get a distinct buttery aroma here too. Extremely complex and well done. This smell blows me away. Taste is in line with the aroma. Rich and malty, with strong fruit flavors - plum, prune, apple, and pear. A very sweet, noticeably tart taste lingers in the front of the mouth before the hop character finally kicks in to balance things out. Don't be misled by my comments, though, because the hops are here purely for balance. They play a bit role in this production. Firm mouthfeel. An all-around quality Belgian ale from Ommegang. Very tasty. Serve with a meal or with dessert.","Atlas1","Mar 17, 2007"

Had a dark cherry almost bloodish color with a thin head that quickly dissipated - was tannish. The aroma was sweetish with a big burgundy front with a hint of the ABV. The taste was good but not as great as I'd hoped. Will need to try a non shipped sample now that they are back. Mouthfeel was good. Overall, it was a good beer in a style that I mostly like but not a major player in my rotation. Like enough to have again in the 12oz size couple times a year.

Aroma of sweet dark malt, Belgian yeast, and more than a little sour acidity, with notes of dark fruit and sour cherries. Palate is a complex blend of dark malt and candi sugar sweetness, offset by subtle notes of dark fruit and yeasty funk. Finish is slightly acidic, like a good balsamic vinegar. Body is creamy, although a little foamy when disturbed - drink carefully in small sips.

As this warmed up it got much richer and the malt was a little more present, hops about non-existant. Are there any grapes hidden in here? Very nice and it was much more inviting as it warmed up.

4.07,-2.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a deep reddish-brown tinted chestnut with good clarity. Tan head of thick fizz quickly fills the glass, showing decent retention and leaving some spotty lacing. Strong raisin aroma, also vinous and fusel are present but mellow. Toasty dark belgian malt and faint Styrian hop scent with soft lactobacillus and fruity phenols in the background. The initial taste is of dark Munich and Aromatic malt, followed by a malt-driven raisin flavor. A solid caramel malt base and appropriate Styrian flavor and bitterness. The afteraste exhibits some medicinal phenols, a lambic-esque fruit character and slight vinous alcohol. This is very well balanced ale with plenty of complexity that represents the style well, as well as abbey beers in general. The medium body is well-attentuated but retains enough malt character so as to not be too dry. The medium cabonation is extra fine, adding a level of crispness without being overly fizzy. Finishes with lots of residual raisin and ripe fruit flavor, along with a boozey warming sensation but still holds a fair drinkability. The label says it was brewed and bottled in Belgium at the Duvel brewery, apparently to meet demand. With such high quality at the affordable price, its obvious why Ommegang is becoming so popular.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 09, 2007"

Taste is of the dark fruits and caramel with some sweetnees and a mere hint of malts. The malt presence was, in my opinion, lacking. All of these flavors hit you upfront but disappear almost immediately. Good mouthfeel, carbonation is a little bit high, and is medium bodied. As for drinkanbility, could I have another?

The body quickly reveals some syrupy and cotton candy tastes; dark chocolate cherries and tinges of alcohol are there. Easy to detect raisins, caramel malts and brown sugar round out the end.

When I look at the lacing on this beer I think of sea foam. The nose is of raisons, brown sugar, plum, dark cherries, some other dark fruity esters, a little hop funk and some minor yeasty bread notes. The flavor is much the same as the smell. Tastes a bit crisp, with some carbonation, there are some nice malt characteristics in this, but it is constantly fighting for supremacy with bitter Belgian (maybe saaz) hops, which is not bad at all, but could be better.

Tastes also of darker autumnal berries..even redcurrants come to mind. The palate was not the strongest part of this beer, though some may like the drying after glow, i did not, its my preference but i like a slightly more flavourful and wet" finish.

They are high quality brews sold at a very competitive price, and I continue to pick them up in preference to many so-called Belgium style beers brewed locally, often at half the quality of Ommegang, and sold at twice the price.

Taste ends off with a burgundy wine tasting alcohol warming. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, creamy, extremely bubbly like champagne at first but dies down after 10 minutes or so.

Plenty of malty, fruity sweetness to start followed by notes of plums, slight bitterness, and licorice. There's also a bit of clove just before the alcohol warmth kicks in at the finish.

Hopped spices and vague fruitiness with a faint hint of alcohol to finish it off. Really pretty underwhelming for what I expect out of a Belgian. Maybe Ive just had too many sterling examples recently to be impressed by something thats "only" Chimay caliber.

Very smooth and balanced, the taste shields the 8.5 ABV, which you don't much feel until polishing off the first half of the 750ml bottle and standing up to get the second half.

Smell does not conceal the alcohol at all, plenty of phenols here. There is a slight grassy taste to it, similar to a saison, that seems to be a typical feature of many dubbels. Could be the hops, but I'm not positive. Overall, I'd say this is an above average Belgian style, better than many actual Belgians I've had. This is def a good deal at $5.69. Will I drink it again? Definitely. Will I seek it out? Probably not too often. All in all, recommended. It may be just what you're looking for, and is definitely worth a try.","audiojon","Apr 06, 2006"

I used a tulip glass, which supported a healthy head throughout the whole experience. The color was a nice brown with a tint of red.

After the initial alcohol burn and malt sweetness, you can detect the nutty taste as well. This is a medium-heavy bodied dubbel with high carbonation and noticable alcohol content. A good example of the style from this American brewery. Sweet and very warm, not overly spiced or cloying though. Well crafted.

I couldn't even taste any malt or hops. Mouthfeel was smooth enough but I couldn't make detailed observations as the yeast taste was rather unpleasant. Maybe I got a bad bottle, or maybe this is the style of Belgian ales. I'm not familiar with Belgian style, so I couldn't say.

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer emerged out of a twelve ounce bottle with a dark brown colour and some crimson tint where the light struck the edges of the glass. A giganstrosity of a tan head volcanoed up half the glass requiring a wait in finishing the fill. The nose was layered with some bizarre perfumed flowery scent that struck me at the onset of sniffing. After this oddity was nosed, scents of heavily candied dark fruit and caramel followed on its heels. Plum and black cherry notes came to mind. The nose was surprisingly light on yeasty character, although some was present within the quite pronounced and rather complex mix of sugary fruitiness. The taste held a sweet aspect at the front end that later tailed into some dark fruit skin like dryness from the hopping. It is always interesting to taste beers like these. So much to consider and revel in. The tones remind me of light caramel and old super ripe plum. A lingering rind quality in the finish keeps the dark fruit flavour alive as the tongue is dried out. This tastes of richness and maturity. In terms of the fruitiness that is. Mouthfeel is a light medium. Speedy and small are the bubbles that contribute to this lightness. The drinkability is good. Plenty of pondering can be had through the course of one glass, though not enough. The earth may not shatter, but there are certainly good tastes and food for thought here.","SupaCelt","Jan 27, 2006"

The first few sips were excellent but over time the spicy/alcoholic character begins to overpower the complex malt flavors making it harder to distinguish.

Taste is dominated by fruit with red wine-like grape notes followed by yeasty twang and a bit of alcohol...unfortunately the mouthfeel here isn't quite right which I think detracts from the complexity of the taste. A bit too light and watery keeps the taste from lingering long after the swallow, the only real flaw with this brew.

Not just a "Belgian-style" abbey ale, as this batch was "Brewed and bottled exceptionally in Belgium" for Ommegang by their buddies at Duvel Moortgat. Pours a clear, deep reddish brown with a fluffy light tan head, quite imposing. The nose is sweet, boozy berries and dried fruits smothered in vanilla with undercurrents of anise. The taste is dry, vinous, and fruity -- prunes, raisins, mashed banana. There's a bit of cloying sweetness at the finish with a dry and somewhat sour aftertaste, sort of like an overripe orange. Creamy mouthfeel, but a bit on the thin side, surprisingly. Also quite a lot of peppery carbonation in the mouth. Highly drinkable as the 8.5 % abv is hardly noticeable. This is a little thinner, and also a bit less complex than I remember the domestically produced stuff I had several times over the last year. That one would have rated all 5's possibly.

4.05,-2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This ale is rather carbonated, much to my surprise. On my initial pour I got at least two inches of head. The initial smell is reminiscent of burgundy and tobacco. When rolling onto your tongue, the sharp bite of the alcohol hits immediately and then relaxes into a traditional malty-sweet "dubbel" taste that evaporates quickly. While sipping this ale, notice the wonderful off-white think lace that appears on the glass almost like a cobweb. At 8.5% you must be careful with this brew, as it is extremely easy to drink, especially with a cigar; highly recommended for the price.","qcitydarkstar","Oct 15, 2005"

While the former does not apply, the latter certainly does, as Ommegang is a wine-like deep red color. It's capped by a yellowish head with good retention. The smell is of dark fruits, especially tart cherries, and not much else. A little too heavy on the cherries, I think. The taste is similar, but a touch better due to the good toasted finish. The mouthfeel is quality, but that can't save Ommegang from being one-dimensional.","battlekow","Sep 17, 2005"

I will have to rank this slightly below the 3 philosophers and rare vos beacuse i find those to be near perfect brews and this isn't quite as pleasant due to the alcohol.

The taste isn't as complex, with notes of raisins, yeast, alcohol, and lots of sweetness. The body is full and has very smooth carbonation.

It also smells fruity. It has a banana aroma. Not much for hops. The malt aroma is also lacking. The main thing I smell is bubblegum. It has a strange taste. It tastes bubblegum like, with a fruity kick to it. I dont know if I like it too much. I think it has a slight medicine like flavor. I dont know what else to say about the flavor.

The alcohol is their but not dominant. The mouthfeel is creamy and finishes crisp.

Speaking of the cork, that sumbitch required the use of a cork screw (something I've never had to do with a beer, it usually just pops right off with fairly little effort). There was a thick white fog sitting stale in the barrel full of a spicey, yeasty aroma. From the pour and presentation I could swear I was drinking a REAL Belgian. The beer pours to a dark burgandy color with a creamy tan colored foam that stays put at a quarter inch and laces beautifully. When poured, the same qualities I mentioned earlier becomes more ubiquitous also providing a hint of banana esters. The taste ranks up there with the finest Belgians I've had, seeming to have several of the same qualities of some of the trappist beers all rolled up into one. Has the yeasty/estery profile of a Chimay red, the appearance and crackling foam of a Westmalle dubbel, the mysterious tastes of Rochefort and Orval, etc. I will surely have to make this one of my staple beers whenever I return to the Omaha area.","neonbrown82","Mar 21, 2005"

Tatse is also very earthy and fruity. Flavors of plum, raisin, some vanilla slight orange. Nicely balanced - not a ton of hop flavor or aroma but that is due to the overwhelming complexity of the malts in this brew.

The fruity/sweet tastes are there, only subtle and in the background. The spicy and expecially peppery tastes overpower taste buds. A very complex taste, different mouthfuls varied from smooth to extremely harsh. I think a little too much of a good thing. I had no interest in having another of this beer.

It kind of reminds me of the winter holiday season even though I don't celebrate. It's grassy and sweet, almost like holding hands with your girlfriend while lying on a cool autumn lawn during twilight. The taste of spiced fruit, but with a strong spice backbone and that sweetness that gives it a slightly spicy body, without being too cloyingly sweet or full.

A subtle version of a strong dark Belgian that does a good job in remaining well balanced without being over the top.","Popsinc","Mar 27, 2004"

The nose first picks up huge notes of alcohol that drift away slowly into banannas and dark malts. The alcohol maskes a lot of the scents. Taste was of dark fruitiness, creamy mellow smoothness, slight chocolate flavors and tons of warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is spritzy and highly carbonated until the yeast is added then it gets mellower. In fact the whole taste gets much more palateable after the yeast. This beer has a lot of promise, but falls well short. The alcohol dominates the nose and the flavor, which is a shame because this could be a great beer.

There is a good maltieness up front and a distinct alcohol taste, this is rounded out with a viariety of fruit and spice flavors. There are traces of vanilla and a twist of hop in the finish.

Of course, at that point, thinking will no longer be an issue. I also feel that there is a certain bias against domestic Belgians but I would urge everyone to forgive Ommegangs domesticity and compare it directly to its heritage.

There was a cherry aftertaste, but who would go through all those nasty ass flavors just to get to the aftertaste? I can't see anyone enjoying this beer. Sure, this beer is strong and will put you on your ass, but if thats what you like, why not just drink Bud Ice instead? It tastes better than this crap! The only good thing going for this brew is its appearance - dark red body (the taste might make you guess it was Red #40) with a huge tan head.

Aromatics are this beer's forte, fortified with robust brown sugar coated simmered fruit namingly plums a rolling malt sweetness so gentle and perfect this beer is. Other aroma evident are the slight hop aroma delicate and light, but evident along with trace of alcohol notes to finish off the smell. Taste is just as easily a winter warmer as a summer sipper well-made and meaty this beer is packed wtih taste slightly nutty quality with cream laced fruit massive complex tones so good you just have to try it for yourself, my my hey hey Belgium style beer is better to drink than to piss away. I don't know what that was but what I meant is this an amazing example of what the American craft brewing seen is capable of it speaks volumes on so many levels of brewing textured with silky smooth qualities and a full medium body astonishing mouthfeel. Drinkability is grade A as far as after I finish this beer I indefinitely want another taste of it. 25.6 oz is enough for anyone especially 8.5% percent by volume, however this beer is to be enjoyed and paired with great food.","WVbeergeek","Jul 10, 2003"
4.57,9.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Deep burgundy hue with a trifling murk. Covered by a beige, thick, steadfast head. Exiguous, wandering near - lace remains. The aroma is a delicate, amiable melange of stately barely ripe banana, rich nutty carob, and mild herbal phenols. After a deliberation, breezy wafts of semisweet cocoa dusted, fermented prune provide a lightly sugared, fruity contrast. Mellow, rounded dark toffee sweetness incipient in flavor is ensued and complemented by a persistent, fruit driven combination of fructose rich raisin and tracely tart underripe plum. As the beer breathes, judicious cocoa and a subtle, earthy hop presence emerge, facilitating an agreeable bittersweet contrast to the residual sweetness. Dark fruit character fades late, but banana esters remain constant, and couple with the light, but perceptibly grainy, bready malt undertone to facilitate a chocolate tinged banana bread impression. After the brief initial carbonic acid bite dissipates, the mouthfeel becomes invariably lightly viscous and pleasantly dextrinous. Finishes with a brusque snap of clove phenol that yields to fleeting hints of sweet, British digestive biscuits. The cellaring has completely assuaged the light, but perceptibly phenolic edge of regular Ommegang, which was already a fine brew. Chocolate character has augmented slightly, while the dark fruity esters have diminished. The end result is a superbly balanced dubbel - esque brew, with superlative drinkabilty. It's affably soft on the palate and certainly delicious. I wish to sincerely thank Feloniousmonk for delivering bottle # 214 to me.","marc77","Jul 10, 2003"

Very rich, creamy mouthfeel is offset by a lightness at the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth. Sweet, full, malt base slowly melts away to leave a light crispness and, in the end, the warmth of alcohol.

Flavors are deep, rich, and fruity -- ripened plums and raisins leading to a an unripe plum-skin bitterness.

"Great beer derserves great food" as they proclaim on the bottle. The star anise shines through on the taste buds. It's spicy, but calm with it's darkness. The mouthfeel is heavy, but what do you expect?; Dark beer, bottle conditioned, spices.

A deep reddish brown with small traces of light through the glass. Sweet smell of ripe cherrys which becomes perfume-like as you sip. Taste is also sweet ripe cherries with a mild apple core aftertaste (not at all unpleasant). There is a medium body and very smooth mouth feel which bring increase its drinkability. Already my favorite 'domestic belgian'. I am very partial to belgian style ales and this domestic brew makes me fall in love all over again.

Where the original Ommegang lacks the "punch" other Belgian dubbles/dark ales (Maredsous, Chimay Grand Reserve, etc) have, the cave aged version just about equals them. It was much more chocolatey and smooth... almost perfect. It's almost as if this was the beer the Brewery Ommegang was attempting to create instead of the young version. The best way to describe it is it's depth. It makes the young Ommegang look simple in comparison and rivals Belgian dark ales.

Dark and dried fruits galore, raisins, grapes, and grape leaves dominate. Spicy yeast undertones are also present. I think I'm getting slight spicy alcohol as well. I'm noticing a trend with the grape aromas in Brewery Ommegang's beers. That's why I mention grape and not just raisin, it's kind of a mixture of both dried and fresh grapes. I think it's great! Not so wine-like in that it, well, doesn't smell almost like vinegar. Anyway, on to the most anticipated part. The flavor! Surprisingly big hop character here, but not at all too much. That hits first, then spicy yeast comes in. These are the two most noticeable characteristics. Fruitiness here is quite subdued compared to that of the aroma, but still present in a little raisin and plum, especially in the back. Spicy alcohol warms the mouth soon after imbibing is commenced. Maltiness is mostly caramel, but a bit bready in the finish and aftertaste. Leafy character in the quality as well. This is my favorite dubbel so far! Great combination of ingredients.

Pretty good brew but not a session beer.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Oct 04, 2002"
4.35,4.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Murky brown color, thick, bubbly tan head. Nice rich smells of ripe fruits, candied apples, bananas and spices. Taste was a very rich deep combination of raosted fruits, plums, berries, yeasty belgian goodness. Nice banana flavor, lots of sweet carmel malts. Finish has a spicy peppery snap to it. Flavors seem to dull as the bottle warms, into a sweet syrupy brown sugar taste with a faint port like taste. Very complex, drinkable and very memorable experience.","StevieW","Oct 02, 2002"
3.89,-6.5,4,5,3.5,4.5,3,"Taste: again bananas, thick sugars, and mild spices present themselves immediately to the tongue. If it ended there I'd be happy, but I keep picking up an annoyingly bitter finish that keeps me from giving this beer as high of rating as I'd like to. Still, at $5 a bottle, I'll be back.","DerKaiser","Sep 27, 2002"

Rich, thick malty flavor with a hint of spice; the beer has an alcoholic warmth going down.  Wow!  Now this is a damn beer!   Bought this beer because I heard about it on Beeradvocate.com.  That's why this site exists.","whit","Sep 16, 2002"
2.77,-33.4,4.5,2.5,2.5,4,2.5,"A great looking Belgian dubbel which looked dark and delicious with a nice creamy head, but I think the high temperature fermentation aromas and flavors seem to overpower. Smells like bananas dipped in chocolate, but the banana is so overwhelming that it smells artificial. The alcohol bite seems to mix well with the banana flavors but it still was hard to drink for me until I had finished about 3/4 of the glass. Then my mouth an tounge were so burnt out that I would not have tasted anything. Not my favorite Ommegang.","Longstaff","Sep 13, 2002"
4.53,8.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Rich chocolate brown hue with hints of auburn, great depth on the eye, the light beige head easily reached a multiple finger in height, it did not budge. Unyielding, cantankerous head retention, it is a very impressive beer visually. The nose does wonderful things to me, the first time I tried this dandy I was dumbfounded at its complexity and beauty. Bubblegum and marshmallows, alcohol, spice, light toffee-chocolate kisses, earthy-horsey-yeastiness, hints of green apple, and distant but solid maltiness. The potency is modest but the invitation is direct and simple, drink me you fool! The maltiness on the palate is more upfront that I remembered, Id say this is a good thing. In the middle, on the tongue, is a spicy, apple tartness, followed by toffee and a trace of chocolate. The finish is quickly sweet with dashes of alcohol and spice, which is rubbed out by more chocolate. This beer is sweet on the palate yet dry. Throughout the flavor profile traditional earthy flavors mingle gracefully. This is on of my favorite Belgiums, it is amazingly complex and well crafted. Medium-full body, modest carbonation that is natural and pleasing. The mouthfeel is very pleasurable and welcoming. Tremendously drinkable. This is a World Class Belgium Strong Dark Ale, brewed in New York! Highly Recommended!","bditty187","Sep 13, 2002"
4.3,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark ruby/garnet color with a thick light brown head that slowly settles out and leaves a nice clinging lace.  The smell is extremely malty with some chocolate nuttiness mixed in there as well as some subtle dark fruit presence.  Great creamy maltiness opens up the brew before going through some fruity tones with some banana and possibly some plums in there.  The rbew then mellows quite a bit and goes to a nice smooth and sweet chocolate character which fades into some nuttiness and then finally to a slightly lingering spicy alcohol flavor than warms through and through.  The smoothness of this brew makes it subtle flavors more noticeable and makes the beer that much more drinkable, it is slightly dry for a beer that starts so sweet and not as sticky or cloying as would be expected.  This is a great brew overall.","Murph","Aug 28, 2002"
4.15,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This brew is powerfull all over.  I dig the look and aroma.  I am put off by the taste.  Too much for me, but I can appreciate its complexity.  Well worth the effort to try this brew.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Aug 19, 2002"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer is a murky looking dark burgandy in color.  A slight chocolate brown head recedes to just an edging within a minute.  The aroma is alcoholic and estery.  Also some wood notes on the nose.  This is a solid tasting Belgian brew.  Very vinous and woody.  Dark fruits play a huge role.  Surprisingly, there is little to note about an alcohol presence.  There's a raw herbalness present also.  Body is pretty light.  Somewhere between light and medium bodied.  Pretty nice brew.  Personally think it is better than the Allagash Dubbel Reserve.","Bighuge","Aug 15, 2002"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy, reddish amber in color with a big fluffy head. The aroma is quite distinct: lightly candyish, dryish dark fruit, slightly burnt toffee, light spice with a bit of honey, and maybe, licorice. The carbonation level is high, but very fine, and gives a creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is bold, offering flavors similar to the aroma. It starts with sweetish flavors, honey and caramel, then moves into a darker licorice and spice as it crosses the tongue, finally drying out nicely in the finish. I find this beer (and all of their beers) age nicely, offering a tighter presentation of its flavors at around a year.","NeroFiddled","Aug 10, 2002"
4.25,2.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Dark, approaching red, with mild head and sweet candy aroma. This is a very sweet beer, with caramel maltiness really jacked up and flavors of sweet fruit. Hints of banana, licorice, and light spices shuffle up the malty sweetness a bit. At the bottom of the brew is a robust, peppery, hearty dark ale that is truly delectable and lends the authentic dubbel flavor, and makes this a great beer for a meat dinner. However it is not quite strong enough to break out through the candy and fruit qualities to make a truly exceptional beer. A lengthy cellaring time could balance it a little better, but I suspect it would just emphasize the overwhemingly sweet port-like candy qualities. Still a remarkably tasty beer, and an exceptional effort for a US brewer.","Thrasher","Jul 29, 2002"

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a very interesting brew.  The 25oz. bottle exudes a very citrus-spice aroma.  The color is a dark amber, but still translucent.  The forst sip tells you that this is something out of the ordinary.  An earlier poster said this would be THE beer if he only had one to drink for the rest of his life...I would have to try it again to be sure, but I would try it again!

4.75,14.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"12 oz capped bottle. Big foaming action as soon as the crown was cracked. Higher levels of carbonation hold the lace together as the hazy maroon amber colour throws a bubble here and there. Alcohol soaked candied fruit, mild clove, hint of anise, caramel and mild citric peel in the aroma. Dry palate with a big crisp high level of carbonation, spicy on the tongue with clove, anise and hints of black pepper. Fruity with ripe tropical fruit, faint metallic earthy flavours bug the taste buds. Powdery yeast in the nearly bone dry finish makes me want to take another sip. Esters are there but not overwhelming. To tell the truth, I prefer this beer out of the corked 750 ml bottle. I think it is slightly more complex from the 12 oz capped bottle.","Jason","Jun 25, 2002"

3.39,-18.5,4.5,3,3.5,4,3,"Deep reddish-amber color, with a thick, creamy head.  Head stays around and lasts longer than the beer itself!  Rich aroma that reminds me too much of a red wine (I'm not a wine fan).  Notes of malt and yeast keep the smell from being a turn-off.  Taste is a bit better than the aroma, with the wine-like taste less pronounced than the smell.  Nice creamy and oily mouthfeel adds to the experience, but not enough to make this a truly enjoyable brew.","Viking","May 11, 2002"
4.3,3.4,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Semi-transparent cocoa color, relatively mild charge to the head, settles to a thin yellow skin. Deep smell, a little like burgundy with the yeasty sense of warm weather in the country. Very thick and impressive initial taste, notes of raisin and grape. Trace of tartness, but it doesn't run out of control. Textured middle, estery and fluffy. Satisfying and semi-coating mouthfeel, trace of a brandy quality. Great finish, leaves a good impression at the back of the throat. A solid, solid brew from Cooperstown, NY.","ADR","May 03, 2002"

This pours with a firm off-white head, great garnet/reddish color, nose is fruity & yeasty...very Belgian.

Beautiful ruby appearance, with a nice tan head that remains throughout. The smell reminds me of fresh baked brown bread, with some honey and butter on it. The taste is malty sweet, but not overly so. It's like bread in a glass. I really want to explore Belgian dubbels now!","mophie","Mar 21, 2002"
