The flavor has fruity yeast with an herbal tinge of hops perhaps, but the malt is lacking in this for my taste.

Appearance had a cherry red raisin color with a slight blood orange hue. clarity was minimal. a big off white head that dissipated somewhat quickly in the glass. The aroma was full of dark candi sugar sweetness. some toffee notes, some dark fruit notes (def. cherry) with a slight citrus and caramel aroma as well. The flavor is not exactly the same though, Some raisin notes perk up in the front. the middle seems to present the moderately strong dark sugar character that is similar in the nose. the mouthfeel i feel is a bit in the middle for a Belgian style ale. it could either finish quicker or hang out but transits while it hangs around. I believe this to be a sessionable style Belgian beer with a higher than average ABV. its aroma really did it for me and the interesting coffee acridness which i am probably confusing for a higher than average hoppyness combined with the malt character is actually very enjoyable.","t8s8l8","Dec 26, 2012"

A hint of alcohol is ever so noticeable. The beer had a nice moderate feel to it with nice carbonation and a dry finish.

A very good dubble here, better than most american versions I've had recently. Dark fruits plus plums with dark bread. Some faint cherry notes and a touch of chocolate. Some banana and hefeweizen tastes. Feel is a step down from medium and is a tad thin, but that makes this even more drinkable.

Esters (which dominate the palate) are pear, green raisin, crisp-style apple, and green grape. Finish is a bit musty and weedy which dries is out with a lingering edginess. Light, yet somehow chewy, in the mouth with way too much carbonation. Has a concerning stomach heartburn, which suggest to me, some sort of contaminant microbe.

Head eventually dissipates into a bull's eye dollop in the center and a frothy band around the edges. Spots and slashes of lacing are exposed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose expresses dark vinous fruits, yeast and an earthy character. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a pleasant herbal quality and a light sweetness. Finish expresses a slight metallic tinge. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a touch of acidity. Overall, a very good American Dubbel.

Bready malt in the nose, followed by some mild stone fruit such as grape, strawberry and some cream in the finish. Big and juicy up front as far as taste goes, with the fruit that was mentioned above. Toward the end it gets much dryer, with a graham cracker like bite, and more full of esthers and yeast. Body is medium, and although the alcohol can be tasted, it does not take anything away from the drinkability. This is my first beer from a brewery I have wanted to try for some time. I am not the least bit disappointed, as this is a very tasty, and complex Dubbel. Looking forward to trying more from these guys. Cheers","jamie2dope","Sep 02, 2010"

My pour netted me a finger of rocky medium- tan head with low retention. Color was a ruby-reddish deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with spices and dried fruits. It smelled like a holiday fruitcake - cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest, prunes, apples, all overlaying a general yeasty mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching a creaminess on the tongue. Jeez, but this was dry! The spices were what really came through on the tongue and then translated to a breathtakingly dry finish. The fruity esters on the nose really got lost in the overall flavor, which is too bad.

It produced a beige/lemon color that was thick and creamy in nature, lasting fairly well then subsiding to a small covering and a ring along the edges. This ring helped produce a thin and spotty lace down the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, big sweet dark fruits (cherry, raisins, plums), spices, wood and some alcohol (light). The tastes that rolled across my tongue were of dark fruits (cherries, plums, sweet raisins), malt (sweet and dark  both mixing together), spices (licorice, cloves), deep wood (like an aging barrel), and some alcohol. It left behind a semi-sweet spicy flavor on the tongue that was very pleasing. This is one complete and balanced beer, from the flavors to the aromas that they produce.

4.57,19,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The body is a cloudy deep copper/ mahogany with an orange cast when held to the light, but it appears much darker and reddish when sitting on the bar. It's creamy yellow-stained ivory head holds well, eventually drops to a nicely creamy collar, and leaves some thin lace throughout the glass. The bold nose expresses lightly sweet and fruity (raisins, prune) malt with a touch of wood and spice. Some alcohol adds to its aroma, but it's really well-engrained and never imposes. The mouthfeel is lightly zesty at first due to its very fine and gently effervescent carbonation; and it becomes creamier as it warms, enhancing the firmly malty body. The flavor is rich and seductive. It starts with soft dark fruit and sweet malt up-front, including notes of raisin, plum, and cherry. It's not tart at all, and the fruity notes blend flawlessly into the sweet dark malt. As it warms in the mouth some woody character becomes apparent. It finishes dry with a mild sweet malt followed by a light spiciness (some clove; maybe a very mild touch of anise?) and then some residual oak. Extremely well-balanced, flavorful, and complex. Immensely enjoyable and highly drinkable! Well worth seeking out for the lover of Belgian-style beers!","NeroFiddled","Feb 06, 2003"
