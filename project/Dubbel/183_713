4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"16 ounce ceramic bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/15/2017. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 13, 2014"

The scent had Belgian sugar, peat and slight roast. The taste was most Belgian leaning with touches of toffee and earth. The mouthfeel was medium in body with not much carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer and worth a try for those that enjoy dark Belgians.","WoodBrew","Jul 13, 2014"

3.83,-1,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured a darkish brown (not close to black) with solid one finger head and lace ring. A mix of yeast and roasted sweet malts, like some caramel and bitter chocolate or coffee mixed with bread and char/roasted malts. Medium bodied with a solid malt base that is sturdy and bready, the beer has a dryness to it not typical in most dubbels. Still, easy to drink and creamy, almost chewey, with a nutty toffeesque sweetness along with touches of dark chocoolate. Yeast adds balance and there is a bit of sharp carbonation; citric hops and dark fruit/raisins/figs taste sensation barely noticeable as mostly muted compared to the sweet and roast malt. Overall, a good beer but just not my preference for this style, hence, my "low" rating.","clayrock81","Jul 08, 2013"

As strong as the caramel and toffee are in the nose, remains clean overall, dark chocolate covers the plum, cherry fruit scents, some oats and sweeter grains, flower and orange citrus driven dissolve. Light-bodied, very foamy in the mouth, soft and fluffs up the whole experience. The caramel, butterscotch, brown sugar notes are obvious but hardly sweet in an enduring fashion, in fact it's a fairly dry beer.

The next aspect of the beer i took notice to was the beautiful raven color of my glass. The lacing of this beer was as if someone had draped a doilie across my glass in the pour. Now to the smell a massive roasted malt caramel breath drew my face into the glass to embibe. The color of this beer being somewhat deceptive it is amazingly drinkable.

Disorganized head remnants tried to cap the beer, it did not. Sparse lacing. The nose was pleasant and typical of a Belgium Dubbel. Soft toasty malts with good amounts of bread, yeast too, the fruitiness is secondary, apples and raisins, distant earthy-spiciness. I prefer more potency but it was still inviting. I found the palate to be exceedingly dry, which I really enjoyed. This is not the most challenging Dubbel IÂ’ve run across. By know means is this simple tasting, stark crystal malts upfront, cleaner than need be, in the middle there is a mildly toothy alcohol bite mixed with a subtle hops spiciness, followed quickly by a note of fruitiness. The finish is lightly peppery, malty but clean and slick. The carbonation is almost completely absent, which is nice, medium body. Respectable mouthfeel. I think this is too easy to drink. I want to have to sip my Â“good beers.Â” I forked out $9.00 for a 16-ounce ceramic jug here in Omaha.

It poured a wonderful clear orange-brown color under a tannish-beige head that was both firm and long lasting. Mine gave beautiful lace rings all the way down. The nose was big and malty - announced its presence with authority. The mouth was a touch on the heavy side and not too tingly, although a bit more than I expected. The initial taste is very complex: caramel, citrus, grains. The finish is a tad too sour, with the lurking presence of alcohol somewhere deep down inside. Buried even more deeply were the hops - they are there, but you sure have to look for them. Hops do come out in the sweetish-sour aftertaste, leaving a mish-mash that I did not actually find all that appealling. This brew was a tad too sour, not bitter enough, for my taste.
