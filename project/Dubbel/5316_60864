Although a dubbel is usually a style that can withstand some time, this is on the smaller side of the spectrum at 7% abv, and over a year past its best by date. So it isn't a prime candidate for cellaring, nor did the brewers intend it to be. This bottle was definitely on the decline, but it's still hard to imagine it being much more than mediocre even within prime freshness. Take my review with a grain of salt, should this beer ever come back around. It wasn't intended to be consumed in this condition, so it may be worth a look.","ryan1788a5","Dec 08, 2012"

Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of balsalmic vinegar, malt, and some dark fruit aromas. Taste is pretty sour with malt, dark fruit, and vinegar flavors all mingled together. There is an acidic quality that lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is definitely having some sort of issues.

3.99,15,4.5,3,4.5,4,4,"CONCLUSION: I think the only reason to hate on this beer would be if you grabbed it out of the fridge and knocked it back without letting it warm. True to the delicate, Belgian style, this needs to warm up to about 50 or else everything will be very muted and flat. The biggest downer for this beer, for me, is it's drinkability. Basically, it's like drinking a yeasty winter warmer. And if a winter warmer is too sweet and rich it can be a challenge to drink 22 ounces--which is exactly the case here. This is an example of a beer that belongs in a 6-pack, not a 22. It tastes great but a 22oz just gets to be too rich for one person towards the end.","MadeInOregon","Jan 12, 2012"

4.17,20.2,3.5,4,4,4,5,"D- Very drinkable. Everyone. This is a great brew, it may be too sweet to pour into 6 packs. if tweeked, maybe, but I like it as it is, and Id be happy to enjoy a few 22's over the course of the evening.","coastiefish","Aug 26, 2010"
3.65,5.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 oz from Fred Meyer. S.Salem. Amber, clear ale with a thick,frothy light tan head. Nice bready,cereal aromas from the malts, a bit doughy and earthy, some bubble gum actually quite pleasing. Sweet malty /banan/bubble gum flavours dominate..gets dryer near the end of the mouthful. OK palate thin side makes this drinkable. Overall not a great Dubbel but i rather enjoyed it.","Reidrover","Aug 07, 2010"
3.53,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into snifter. Pours clear and amber with creamy head and good retention, not a ton of lacing. Smell is of some biscuit malt and some dark fruit, almost a bit of cherries. Taste has that biscuit malt with some yeast, again dark fruit with a bit of sweetness to it. Pretty dry feel to it, not too heavy nut definitely full in the mouthfeel. Overall a decent beer.","bunnyhustle","Beers"
