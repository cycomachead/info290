Aroma of raisins, figs, dark malt, caramel. Moderate carbonation, full moutfeel, overall quite tasty. Notes of raisins, caramel, dark malts, galangal root, and a subtle alcohol warmth. As it warms up more melon rind notes appear...small sediment floaties at the end. Nice complexity and flavors.","DenverLogan","Jan 06, 2013"

3.92,2.3,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Review #1900. Looks like Belgium has indeed come to the Land of the Sooners. Right on. This bit of evidence pours a deep sunset ruby-auburn topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises clove, raisin, rye bread, banana, fig, dark toffee, light nutmeg, and a nice undercurrent of cocoa. The taste holds notes of clove, banana peel, light orange peel, brown sugar, black pepper, nutmeg, dry caramel, and lightly-toasted wheat bread. The toastedness and spices really come through powerfully, taking out much of the rest. Luckily, enough remains for things to nearly balance out. Unfortunately, I don't get the cocoa anymore. Shame, really. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly grainy feel. Overall, a more-than-solid dubbel, one that Belgium would be proud to have birthed herself.","TMoney2591","Oct 17, 2011"
4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a staple December beer in my house. Bold flavors that are delicately inter-weaved. Very well done.","StaveHooks","Oct 16, 2011"
3.55,-7.3,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"O- I think this is the first Dubbel I have tasted (at least that I can remember) I enjoyed it. I don't really have another Dubbel to compare this too but I liked it, so I will give it a B.","BeerNutz324","Oct 07, 2011"
3.55,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The nose brings a bit of caramel and dark fruit. Some bread crust there as well. Faint pepper and phenolic. The dark fruit character is fairly mild, though I'd say it is the most dominant. The flavor adds a bit of sweetness and a bit more pepper. Dark fruits throughout. Medium body with fair carbonation. Light alcohol presence. Fairly dry in the finish as well after a semi-sweet palate. Pretty decent, but not something I'd seek out again.","Thorpe429","Sep 21, 2011"
2.96,-22.7,4,3,3,2,3,"O - Don't like this take on a dubbel. Too thin, malty, boozy, and carbonated. It's not like it's horrible, but I find it a poor and weird example of the style, or a bad take on it.","AgentZero","Jul 14, 2011"
3.33,-13.1,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Drinkability: Overall, drinkable, but not sure it would be my first choice. The alcohol content is 8%, but didn’t feel overpowering to me. The mouth/feel was a bit weak, but that might be just my opinion. The fruity smell and taste, while a bit strong at the beginning, grew on me as I drank it. The biggest drawback for me was the amount of carbonation. Every drink felt much too fizzy in my mouth, and made it a bit disappointing even though the taste was fine.","JoshKlugh","Jun 29, 2011"

3.23,-15.7,4,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Drinkability: The alcohol in this seems higher than eight percent to me, but, what do I know. This is an enjoyable beer, though the amount of sweetness that crosses that palate was a bit much The beer has a very nice fruit profile which I wouldn't change, but I'd lower the alcohol, thin out the body (mostly in carbonation) and I think this would be a more drinkable beer.","Ek0nomik","Mar 25, 2011"
2.88,-24.8,3,2.5,3,3,3,"O: It seems like this brew doesn't have enough of the Belgian characteristics to be a great dubbel, and it seems to lack body.","Beejay","Mar 19, 2011"
4.32,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a fine enough example of a Belgian dubbel. Its one of the better dubbels brewed on this side of the pond. While I can't say its on par with Chimay Rouge or St Bernardus Prior 8, it's a quality dubbel none the less. Props to the folks north of the border for crafting a tasty brew.","Sweasty","Feb 04, 2011"
4.05,5.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Excelent variation of a Belgian-Dubbel. Poured a good head with a good dark amber, almost Burbon color.

4.5,17.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dry and drinkable, yet semi-complex and a dry-ish malt bomb. Nice for a change to have a Dubbel that does not rely on that typical sweet alcoholic combo; it rivals its Belgian counterparts.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"
3.59,-6.3,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of alcohol, toffee and raisins. The flavor is very heavy on the dark fruit - specifically raisins. I also get some apples, Belgian candi sugar, toffee and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium to high carbonation.","Mora2000","Dec 05, 2010"

3.03,-20.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"D: Pretty average overall. Too thin, not carbonated enough, lacks the character I expect in a Dubbel. For this to have gold-medaled, it must have been a bad year for Dubbels.","Ambiorix","Nov 27, 2010"

4.09,6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a Westmalle chalice a dark amber with a very thin head. The scent is very strong of grapfruit notes and belgian yeast. The flavor is also strong, a rather nice suprise. Lots of carmeled malted front end. Some of that grapefruit flavor is in there also with some raisin after taste. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style with just the right amount of carbonation.","whoneeds8","Oct 05, 2010"
4.17,8.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours to a thin off-white head and hazy amber-red color. Aroma is complex, fruity and spicy with caramel, vanilla and fruit notes. Flavor is Belgian all the way with fruity and malty flavors dominating, with some malt sweetness balanced by the hops and the drying effect of the 8% alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium and very effervescent. Overall, this is a very good example of the style, technically flawless and totally above reproach.","EagleTalon","Sep 19, 2010"
3.1,-19.1,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Drinkability: When I think of the best an Abbey Dubbel has to offer, I seriously doubt Choc's offering will immediately spring to mind. This one just didn't have the desired body and stayed sweet til the end. Still, it's okay, I guess, and works in a pinch, especially in Oklahoma.","ChainGangGuy","Aug 11, 2010"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours an amber-brown color. The head is three inches in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of star anise, spice box, dark fruit, and plums. This is a very interesting aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma. The is a lot of nice spice, and enough malt to balance things out without getting cloying. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with vigorous carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very fine dubbel.","KarlHungus","Aug 09, 2010"
3.76,-1.8,2,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bomber as part of my haul from Midtown in Tulsa. Pours a dark ruby red with minimal bubbly head that quickly fades away. Smells of fruitcake and other spice - nutmeg, clove. Kind of like Christmas in a bottle. Taste is of fruitcake and figs. Slight malt character and sweetness in the finish with some heat from the alcohol. Further sips yield notes of brown sugar and cherry. Needs more malt character to balance out how sweet it is. It's highly carbonated but has a disappoiting body for a beer this tasty. Decent example of a Belgian dubbel, may be a little too sweet for some palates.","eclaycamp","Jun 26, 2010"
3.35,-12.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Nice to see Choc expand their offerings.","htomsirveaux","May 18, 2010"
4.18,9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Nothing too crazy about this beer, just a (for the most part) well made to style dubbel. Pours a dark mahogany/amber with a retentive bubbly light brown head. Aroma is a sweet, rich toasted blend of malts, fruity esters, yeast and sugars. Flavor is similar to nose, initially sweet with caramel malt, raisin and plum before a slightly more toasted malt and spicy finish. Medium bodied with slightly aggressive sharp carbonation producing a relatively dry, clean finish. Not quite the class of the style, but an excellent American interpretation, I would enjoy having this as a local.","yourefragile","May 17, 2010"
3.08,-19.6,4.5,4,2.5,2.5,3,"Ok, I'm starting to come around a LITTLE BIT. This beer has more to offer than metallic taste, though I still can't get past that flavor.","happilysurly","Mar 24, 2010"
3.62,-5.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This isn't a bad beer but it isn't on the same level as a true Belgian Dubbel it has a good taste thats enjoyable but not as good as an authentic I'd say its still worth a try though","armock","Mar 13, 2010"
3.75,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pretty drinkable, and solid overall. Well what do you know, a Belgian dubbel from Oklahoma and it's not even half bad. Crazy.","nickd717","Mar 08, 2010"
3.53,-7.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Very solid and worth a try. Though it is not among my favorites of the style or Choc's Signature series.","champ103","Mar 07, 2010"

4.07,6.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability? Despite the required abv for the style, this is certainly easy enough to drink and I find that the more I drink it, the more I like it. Way to go Krebs Brewing!","Bitterbill","Feb 04, 2010"
4.35,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a wonderful beer and deserves its acclaim. Only strength of flavor and conservative dryness keeps it from rivaling Chimay Red and Rochefort 6. Thanks again BlueOkie!","BEERchitect","Jan 08, 2010"
3.85,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Noted: Rereviewed the same batch a few months later and the carbonation/mouthfeel has really improved with the additional conditioning time.

4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A very good offering from Choc, was excited to pick up a bottle and this is definately going to be one I pick up often. Since it is a local, it's also a great value at around 5 bucks for a 22oz bomber.

3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Ugh, unfortunate volcano effect as I lost a good deal of the bottle upon opening. This is a 22oz bomber poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Dark brown to black color, fizzy and well carbonated (obvious after the eruption). Smell is very sweet: a combination of candy sugar and grapes. Taste is sweet as well with more sweet dark grape juice, pears, and other fruits. Fairly light bodied and pretty easy to drink, this is a pleasant surprise.","webmanspidey","Oct 09, 2009"
