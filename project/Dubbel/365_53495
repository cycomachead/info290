Smell is of malt, caramel, dark fruit, and sugar aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors for an American take on the style.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 26, 2014"

3.56,2,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep mahogany brown pretty cloudy with a huge almost out of control head that is lacing quite a bit. Smell is of caramel malt a bit of tastiness and a touch of spice. To me a little on the light side. Taste is of the caramel malt and some dark fruit. Malt may go as far as being slightly roasty. Little if any yeast notes maybe just a touch of ester but it is limited. Mouthfeel is quite lively with only a bit of hop bitterness but enough to balance the slightly sweet finish. Overall not a bad dubbel not my favorite example but it is quite accessible and enjoyable.","fank2788","May 27, 2011"
3.61,3.4,2.5,4,3.5,3,4,"O - Overall a tasty offering and worth taking for a spin. Offers some unique flavours and is quite drinkable. The bitterness that lingers alongside the spices might be a bit much for some people, but I quite enjoyed it.","andrenaline","Apr 17, 2011"
3.77,8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured this and has the look of Coca-Cola. Heavy brown that is not transparent. Thin head with a film covering. Malts and toffee are noticeable. Flavor is deep with character. Warm alcohol, toffee and an oakiness. A little bit of spiceness. A full bodied ale that is chewy in the mouth. Overall, a good, heavy beer that is worthy of another purchase.","spree92","Apr 06, 2011"
2.87,-17.8,2,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Opinion: Overall, this is unusual for a Dubbel, that's for sure. It isn't a disgusting beer or anything, and may pass for some version of an American Brown Ale in the aroma, while really just ending up as an estery unbalanced mess in the flavor. I haven't cared for this beer to say the least. I really think that it is just an American Brown Recipe stepped up with some two-row and fermented with Belgian yeast. I have been pretty disappointed with this beer. You would think that if they were going to go through the trouble of putting out a Belgian style beer like this, that they would want to come remotely close to the style. I guess this is a beer brewed for some off-the-wall category in the GABF with no intention of ever holding water to any of the real classic examples of this style. Stay away from this beer if you like Dubbels. If you like hotly/estery fermented American Brown Ales...give this a shot.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 06, 2011"

2.96,-15.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,4,"A dark brownish orange. Aroma is biscuity-malt, a little must. Flavor is more rich malt, but not much of that Belgian funk or spice you expect from a Double. There are hints of bakers chocolate and maybe some died fruits, but its more malt and biscuit. Its not a bad beer, it drinks well and can be sessioned. Just not a great example of the style.","Liverpool08","Feb 03, 2011"

3.5,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reincarnated into a Dubbel, this brew is dark and opaque. The lacing is sufficient enough to resemble a beer. My nose wafts charred wood, medicinal herbs and vague tropical fruit. It is creamy and smooth, with a big body. Unsweetened dark chocolate, highly toasted bread and a thick biscuity layer appear in the finish and really show what the malt is about. Warming fruity alcohol in the middle with an herbal phenol character throughout. Bitterness from the coriander helps to balance this beer. It ends with a bit of burnt, bitter and malty flavor. A pretty good go at the Dubbel style, but a bit Porter-like.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"
3.75,7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A decent dubbel, actually drier than the usual offerings from the old country. Nicely spiced, with the yeast kept well in check - good and drinkable, especially as the Yankee Juniors get their asses handed to them in Buffalo, Ontario...","biboergosum","Jan 03, 2011"

4.23,21.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked up this bomber at TW, it wasn't thrown to to me like a big fat salmon, but that's ok, if I would have dropped it, I wouldn't get to review it! Ok then, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a huge malt smell, not many hops, mostly fruity esters, banana mostly, and backbone. Poured into a 20 ounce chalice, the brew is a barely translucent dark red with a light tan head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is great, for this ABV, I would think so. On the taste, the big belt of malt continues, big backbone, some cloves come through, with some late caramel and still later pumpkin. The mouthfeel is excellent, good carbonation and viscosity a hint before syrup. This is a beer my friends, and for the price, it's a weener.","mooseisloose","Oct 02, 2010"
3.73,6.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Aroma is not strong, but fruity with an undertone of malt and a hint of caramel. It pours a nice dark translucent mahogany with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled, pale tan head that sticks around and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Flavor is fruity and malty with caramel and nutty hints and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is smooth but just a little fizzy, not particularly distinguished. Worthy of at least a try.","Cyberkedi","Sep 29, 2010"
3.53,1.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Tandem is supposed to be an abbey dubbel, but it doesn't really do a good job. There are the raisin, jammy flavors, and some orange, but it doesn't quite have the spicy clove, intense fruitiness and overall impact that good dubbels have. The aroma is a lacking the complexity and caramel malts, but appearance is fine and the mouthfeel good.","Soonami","Sep 28, 2010"
3.62,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not a style I go to often but I like the Pike stuff I have had to date.Poured into a goblet a slight hazed russet brown with a thinner quick to fade off white head.Dark fruit and phenolic spice are the main components in the aromas,slight sweetness from the alcohol as well after the beer warms alittle.Big dark fruit flavors,raisin and fig like others have notes are the domianate flavors,some phenolic clove-like spice and even a hint of smoke.A little prickly at first in the mouth but it settles down after a bit,its not bad but not anything to go search out in my opinion.","oberon","Sep 09, 2010"

3.87,10.9,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Taste is woody-clove fruitness, hint of toasty grain and sweet wine, slightly on the sweet side but pretty balanced. The flavours, though not too complex, hold up well and it is a lot more flaovurful and complex than quite a few abbeys that I've have had, far too many seeming rather one-dimensional.","Offa","Aug 23, 2010"
3.65,4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This guy pours a dark ruby brown topped by a couple layers of light tan foam. The nose comprises rye bread, brown sugar-cinnamon, light red grapes, and a touch of orange flesh. The taste is nearly identical, with a bit more rye bread, a dash of pepper, and a smattering of greens. The body is a fair medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel.

The aroma has a bunch of dark fruits upfront (notes of black cherry, raisin, plum, date) along with a little chocolate, some caramel and toffee, yeasty esters, and a little alcohol. The flavor also has big dark fruit notes intially (raisin, plum, pomegranate), along with some chocolate, molasses, toffee, funky yeast, burnt bread and some alcohol The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is good.
