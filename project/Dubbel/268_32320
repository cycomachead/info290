It could do with a character boost to make it stand out from its peers - goes down OK but otherwise unexceptional. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Oct 19, 2014"

Smell is of malt, dark fruit, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but the metallic quality I am getting in the flavor isn't all that nice.","UCLABrewN84","May 27, 2013"

3.87,1.6,3.5,4,3.75,4,4,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy caramel amber with a two finger white head that dissipates quickly to an active bubbly ring around the glass. Spicy aroma of orange, apple juice, caramel malt, Belgian spicing. Flavor follows aroma with apple and pear juice, mild dark dried fruit, orange citrus, caramel malt, toffee. Finishes somewhat abruptly with residual spice, slightly sour and metallic, probably from the clove or cardamom. Medium bodied with active carbonation. I enjoyed the unusual mixture of dubbel sweetness with the mildly sour finish, but the abrupt loss of fruit and malt combined with the metallic bitterness decreased the quality of the finish. Still an interesting and enjoyable take on the dubbel style.","LiquidAmber","May 01, 2013"

3.9,2.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 11/2013. Pours hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger foamy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Decent spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big apple, raisin, prune, molasses, caramel, earth, clove, herbal, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good balance and strength; big on the fresh apple aromas until it warms up. Taste of big apple, raisin, cherry, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, earth, toast, pepper, clove, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of apple, dark fruit, caramel, molasses, earth, toast, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a nice slick and lightly foamy mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a very nice dubbel. Nice flavor balance and complexity, and quite smooth. Maybe a touch too earthy, but I really have no complaints. Very well done.","superspak","Jun 29, 2012"

3.92,2.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Nose in the style characteristic of the dubbel. Fruity, with black grapes, prunes, wrapped with a touch of alcohol interesting, such as black currant syrup.

3.8,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Close to two fingers of dense dark tan foam, you'll get a swell of larger bubbles at the spot where you pour, a little above average retention, just about the same can be said for the thin streaks of lacing. Cloudy muddy brown liquid, more yellow accents to it than orange, clearer at the rims. Spicy, peppery nose, coriander, more than enough to offset the toffee, caramel, milk chocolate component, raisin and fig scents fresh, no over-concentration, a splash of rum, earthy with a leesy edge. Medium-bodied, displays good balance, the carbonation has the right level of churn to keep things lowkey. As in the nose, drier than expected with the earth, grass, peat, charcoal flavors mingling with the rich milk chocolate, butterscotch, caramel flavors. Cherry and apple accompany the raisin, fig here. Less arch spiciness than in the nose. But, conversely more resonant orange citrus. Warming brings coffee, yeast, brazil nut notes. Again, balanced, the parts fit well together, just kinda not so interesting.","BucBasil","Jul 29, 2010"
