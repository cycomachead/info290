Smells like sweet raisin bread with some caramel apple notes. Tastes sweet and fizzy, strong raspberry soda flavor that gives way to the more bready malt character that has hints of raisins, plums, dates. Tangy finish, surprisingly dry, scary drinkable for 9%. An unusual beer to me. As it warms it seems to get thicker with a dark cherry flavor and a stronger alcohol bite. The fizziness is very distracting and makes this seem almost like "beer soda".","anarchia","Dec 12, 2013"

3.91,8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Enjoyed this one in the company of the brewer himself! Bottle February 2010. Served from bottle into a St. Martin tulip. Poured ruby red with a three finger light tan head that subsided to two fingers really slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, plum, raisins, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really liked how complex the flavor was on this one for a Dubbel. However at 8% you definitely would have thought it was much higher due to the flavors of alcohol you got off of it. The aroma was a little weak in comparison to the flavor but was still pretty nice. A definite must try if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Aug 26, 2011"

3.4,-6.1,4,4,3,4,3,"750ml bottle served in my Chimay Chalice. Bottled March 2010 notched on the back label. Pours a dull brownish-purple with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head pockmarked with tiny craters. A consistent sheet of tiny bubble clusters adhered to the walls of the glass below the cap. Head eventually dissipates into a sudsy skim and a thin, bubbly band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing, but no adherence. Nose expresses dark fruit (prunes and plums) and a mild, vinous quality. There's also a slightly bready/maltiness in the mix. Taste pales in comparison to the nose - muted and bland with a trace of something metallic in the mix. There's also a bit of yeast that cuts across the flavor profile. Virtually no aftertaste - flavors just drop away between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation that offers a slight bite at the back of the throat before culminating in a pleasant, dry finish. All and all, a bit dull for style - not bad, but not something I plan on revisiting anytime soon.","Jwale73","Apr 22, 2011"

Typical dark, sweet raisin wafting, but refreshingly thin and dry on the tongue. Just a bit meaty and metallic, not unpleasant. Easy to drink more than one, despite 8% ABV.

Definite Belgian funk adding some dried fruit and spice (a bit of clove, maybe cinnamon) to a whole wheat breadiness and a bit of alcohol vapor. Flavor starts out with brown sugar sweetness that is cleansed by hop bitterness and perhaps a touch of sour. The beer tastes a lot less full that it is, probably due to the hops, touch of sour, and the significant alcohol presence. Certainly not the most complex Belgian style brew on the market, by why does it have to be? it does what it does quite well and scores a lot more points in the drinkability column than most 8% ABV beers, though trying to session this beer will fog the brain cells far faster than it will tire the taste buds.","MillRat","Jul 18, 2010"

This one's a bit hazy because of all the bubbles encased in the beverage. The nose is a bit underwhelming, but there are hints of that familiar Belgian dubbel dark fruitiness, along with some dark malt and sweet sugary characteristics as well. The flavor is a bit odd, but I really like it; it's not as sweet and fruity as most Belgian dubbels. Instead, it's more like a strong American brown ale without the over-the-top hoppiness. I admit it's very refreshing to taste this, and I clearly want more like it! It is a tad over-carbonated for my taste--sometimes I find myself fighting through the bubbles to get to some flavor.

In fact, I haven't had a legitimate Belgian brew before (aside from Stella Artois). By the way, the aforementioned "Dark Triple" was definitely a notch above this one. Would prefer the Tripel style and I'm sure there are better readily available examples of the Dubbel than this. Was a neat experience to purchase and try, though.","EbPhrygian","Apr 12, 2010"

3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I love Dubbels but there are much more desirable examples out there. I relate St Martin Brune to a lot of movies I've seen: it was worth sitting through once but not really a second time. I liked it alright, it was well worth the price of admission but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others. Final review: one thumb up, one thumb sideways.","biegaman","Mar 20, 2010"
2.89,-20.2,4,2.5,3,2.5,3,"This wasn't bad, but doesn't really compare to other Belgian beers for either taste or aroma. The beer has a nice deep copper color, but the smell borders on metallic, not yeasty like a typical Belgian. The flavor is also a bit one dimension and thin, with neither the yeastiness one expects from this variety nor the roasted sweetness typical of dark beers. This would probably be fairly drinkable, but I wouldn't have too many of them based on the quality of beer for the price. Flying Dog even does Belgians a lot better than this one (not to mention Chimay, Corsendonk, Saint Bernardus, Duvel, etc.).","HeightsEats","Mar 15, 2010"
3.48,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"330 ml bottle, now available in Norway at Vinmonopolet. ABV is 8%. Mahogany coloured beer, huge beige head. Moderate aroma, notes of caramel, brown malts, brown bread and dust, hints of marzipan. The flavour has notes of brown bread with hints of caramel, but this is probably the driest dubbel I have ever had. Dust in the finish, very moderate hops. The alcohol is well hidden - I would have guessed that this was a 5.5- 6% beer, not 8%. Definitely drinkable, but far from exciting.","Sigmund","Mar 13, 2010"

3.82,5.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cola brown color with no haze, and a large head at first that recedes to no head at all rather quickly. Nose has plenty of dark fruits and strongly suggests it will be a dessert beer for sure. On the palate the dark fruit component is center stage with plenty of carbonation, rather nice body, and some mineral-cave like must flavors in the mix. Finish is sweet and reminds me of figs.","yemenmocha","Mar 01, 2010"

3.53,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"11.2oz bottle, bought for about $3 in Columbus. The beer is dark hazy brown, nearly opaque, with a thick solid tan head. The aroma is sweet, caramel and dark fruits, maybe a little cough syrup, kind of reminds me of Gouden Carolus or an aged Belgian dark ale (which this might be, I don't see a date stamp). The taste is estery, dark fruits like plums and raisins, some ethanol too, OK but not mindblowing considering all the Belgian ales of high quality out there. Average body, drinkability is set to "slow" which is probably about right for the style. Overall average-to-middling.","TurdFurgison","Sep 29, 2009"
4.02,11,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"11.2 oz shipped from the beer motherland. Almost black in color with a thick creamy light tan head. Smells of raisins, brown sugar, and oranges. Seems much darker than most dubbels, both in appearance & smell. The taste is malty, sweet, again like brown sugar. It has a dry finish that balances the sweet up front. The mouthfeel is slick, with nice carbonation. Drinkability is good, although its a bit too dark & intense for a session beer. But this bottle and I are becoming good friends.","roblowther","May 03, 2009"

3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep brown color ale with large foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of candi sugar with good Belgian malt backbone. Taste is also a nice mix between some candi sugar and strong malt backbone with some notes of dry fruits such as raisins. Good carbonation and full body with no noticeable alcohol. Very well done overall and a bit more character would have made this even better.","Phyl21ca","Feb 06, 2009"
3.03,-16.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours a dark brown color with foamy white head. Dark fruit, spice and candi fruit aroma. Quite carbonated up front with lots of dark fruit (raisin, plum and prune), spices and candi sugar. Sweet, but not too much so, with a nice dry finish.","corby112","Nov 27, 2008"
3.97,9.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Dark brown in color-somewhat cloudy-nice head and a high CO2 level. Nutty and malty aroma-quite bready and a touch of yeastiness. Solid malt flavor with a slight spiciness reminiscent of cinnamon. Nice lingering yeasty/sulfur taste. Good mouthfeel-the high carbonation really livens it up a bit. Nice dubbel and very enjoyable.","lackenhauser","Aug 18, 2008"
3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark to the point of being almost black with a foamy tan head this beer smells like raisin tarts. The flavour favours the fruit over the dark musty side of a dubbel. Not a ton of complexity but a pleasand dubbel that is like raisin pie with a funky Belgian twist.","canucklehead","Aug 17, 2008"
3.35,-7.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D: Not bad flavor wise but certainly would not hold my attention beyond the initial first drink. Thins out towards the finish and is somewhat disappointing after a initial promising start.","beerthulhu","Jul 06, 2008"
3.45,-4.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Abbaye de Saint-Martin Brune is a poor man's Belgian dubbel.

3.17,-12.4,4,2,3,4.5,4,"Poured a dark ruby color with a thin off-white head. Very bubbly but not much flowing towards the nose. I couldn't pin down anything. The first taste is of raisins. I couldn't put my finger on it right away. I hate eating raisins and haven't had one since I was a small child so it took a minute to figure that one out. After that the carbonation took over and the flavors were muted. Of course, not really any detection of alcohol which made a very drinkable beer. Overall, the beer was good but in my experience the carbonation in this style has usually heightened the aromas and flavors and this one ended up being "flat."","CrazyMacHarris99","Feb 12, 2008"
3.9,7.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured an orangey light brown into a sampler glass, with a slightly grey fluffy head. Big thing with this one is the excellent mouthfeel. Flavour is mild chocolate and cocoa, quite deep and dark for a dubbel, but very nice. Some raisins in there, and mild sour notes as it gets warmer. Aftertaste is just a little "off" although I'm not sure if I can describe it. Really nice, although I'm biased as I've never found a dubbel I didn't like.","crwills","Dec 02, 2007"
3.74,3.3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Much lighter in complexity in the mouth which may be a culprit of over carbonation. The beer has a very prickly carbonation that blasts the tastebuds and makes things hard to comprehend. Caramel notes with very minor milk chocolate accents with much less pronounced dried fruit characteristicts. Mainly dates with a bit of prune. A floral bitterness comes through on the finish as well as some alcohol burn in the chest.","mcallister","Nov 30, 2007"
