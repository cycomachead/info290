Some are closer to a sour than an ale, and with the sour bottles the carbonation is overwhelming. On draft, it is much better and is closer to the dubbel in flavor.","Monkeefartz","Sunday at 11:29 AM"

Love the color, I will call it Deep Purple. Very little head or carbonation. Excellent smell, you definitely get the Belgian in the nose. Mixed bag with the taste. Interesting and tasty, balanced. Pretty easy to drink which gives it a little bonus overall due to alcohol content. I enjoyed the beer and would gladly drink again and would probably buy depending upon the cost.","JamieDuncan","May 27, 2014"
