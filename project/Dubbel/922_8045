4.25,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.25,"33cl bottle served in a tulip.  20/08/11 printed on the back label. Pours a mahogany hue with a slightly murky clarity and a dense, three inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a rocky, half inch cap leaving delicate, textured spatters of lacing in its wake.  Nose expresses raisins, figs, prunes and yeast.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a definite candied fruit quality added to the mix.  Also, as the beer warms, some tannic notes are revealed as well as a cold-brewed tea character at the  finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a mild, even carbonation.  Overall, this may be my favorite dubbel.  Great complexity and flavor and I almost get a cotton candy character in the flavor profile.  Truly top notch.","Jwale73","Jan 18, 2015"

Poured a deep reddish brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, fruit, and subtle spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, spice, fruit, raisin, and subtle toasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation (almost creamy). Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really like the components going on in this one in both the flavor and aroma. It was really well balanced and decently complex. If there would have been just a little more going on, this could have definitely been on a whole new level. A really well put together brew that I would suggest to anyone out there.","thagr81us","Nov 22, 2012"

Pours very hazy reddish brown color with a very nice 2 finger fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge raisin, apple, prune, banana, pepper, candi sugar, caramel, earth, and yeast spices. Damn nice aromas with a ton of fruity complexity and nice balance. Taste of raisin, prune, apple, pear, caramel, biscuit, toast, pepper, earth, candi sugar, molasses, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, bread, pepper, caramel, molasses, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance; no cloying flavors at all, very clean finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly slick and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding dubbel! Great flavor complexity and balance; extremely crisp and easy to drink.

Complex aroma of dark and light fruit, caramel, Belgian spices. High carbonation. Sweet dark fruits, spice and caramel start and middle with a somewhat bitter metallic finish, probably because of the carbonation. The bitter finish is well balanced. A very nice dubbel.

It gets better as is warms, and is a beer best drank after a meal, when you can just relax with it. The head was not anything to particularly write home about (I do own a goblet glass for these specialties). However, the caramel-coffee smell was very savory, and hard to put down after a drink. It is a strong beer, but the sweetness of it masks the alcohol content nicely. Personally, I think it is the best out of the Trappist Breweries, and is not overly expensive.","AMiz602","Jan 02, 2012"

Taste is of dark fruits (cherry, grapes, plums), grape juice, yeast, and spices. Beer is very carbonated and is very bubbly and crisp. There is a bit of an alcohol burn in the throat with each sip.

Sweets and potency in alcohol is hinted, not present. Bananas are very strong, along with fresh strawberries, vanilla and whipped cream. Despite strong malts, and a very nice and pleasant hops dry bite, the beer's age leaves a metallic mouth. Bitter chocolate and apples still come in. Very carbonated on the tongue. Very light, but at 5'C, left a strong alcoholic taste in the palate. Very warm and fizzy. Lemon and chocolate. Very sweet smelling beer. Yet does not deliver like a Koningshoeven.

This is definitely a dubbel to drink only lightly chilled. The flavor balance is different than I recall from other dubbels, but is quite nice. One way to describe the impression it leaves is that it is "austere" rather than lush. My overall impression is that this is a very well made beer that has been overshadowed to a degree by other Trappist dubbels which may be "bigger" in flavor but that are not any better.

4.75,15,5,5,5,4.5,4,"The reviewed beer belongs to a lot of bottles that came near to the expiration date declared on their labels. The beer evolves continuously with aging and so does my curiosity so lets try one while still within the limits of rapidly approaching BBE (17.01.2010). The beer is highly effervescent so needs to be poured quickly within seconds after cap removal as it literally erupts from the bottle. St. Bernardus goblet gets instantly crowned with spectacular tan head that never completely fades although its surface become dimply as it gradually subsides forming thick solid cap above the dark coppery-brown liquid. Nose pampering aromas of barriqued red wine, grape seeds, unrefined sugar, grapes, berries - predominantly strawberries, fully ripened figs, wine soaked raisins and trace of cocoa. How I wish they would make such fragrance for women... The fully matured flavor profile closely corresponds to the aroma - slightly vinous with all sorts of dark fruits and berries whose sweetness is gently balanced by grape seed and bread crust bitterness. This is perhaps the most complex beer I've ever encountered. Prickly yet velvety smooth followed by mild pleasantly warming sensation in the stomach. So good it's almost unreal. I still have a dozen bottles or so and will continue to cellar some to see how this beer gains with further aging. Based on recent experience the future seems promising. I dunno how fresh Achel would do it but an old one is the finest of all dubbels. I don't see a beer of its kind capable of dethroning this one in the foreseeable future.","crnipeter","Dec 26, 2009"

The aroma is a tad faint, some dark candi sugar and red grapes. Some medicinal notes as well. The taste is sweet from the candi sugar, some hints of chocolate and berries/grapes, and a rusty metallic twang. The feel is fairly light and well carbonation, perhaps too much so.

The flavor won't disappoint. Again, lots of sweet malts, candied sugars, some caramel and butterscotch, maybe some green apple. You will also find a rather yeasty carbonation towards the finish that is characteristic of the style as well.

The foam is beautiful and extremely consistent; it almost looked like it would be hard if you touched it. Thick rings of lace left. The first sniff above the glass gives candy sugar and some delicate hopping, almost Saaz-like. A lovely saline, metallic aroma not wholly unlike Orval. The malts are very softly roasted, giving brown sugar and cinnamon rolls, along with the tinge of alcohol which slowly increases the more you smell the beer. Rye bread, mould(extremely dusty and earthy), cream and caramel notes too. Lovely aroma, if not quite as complex as some Trappists. The taste is all nuts and whole-grain bread at first. The middle has some saltiness akin to pasta sauce, and the finish is all about the grainy malts and even the lightest of bittering hops. More hopping than some of the other Trappists, actually. A lovely aftertaste of bread and butter, with hints of roasted chestnut and white wine. Wonderful taste, balanced and extremely drinkable. Medium carbonation, very velvety.

Syrupy during the drink, tons of finely tuned carbonation sweep this away. What a fricking outstanding dubbel and if not the best it has to be one of the best.

Looks the part of a dubbel for sure, with a dark coca-cola complexion and a thick dimpled foamy cap. She's a smokin' hot looking Belgian brunette, alright. The smell is where I cease to be impressed with this beer, as was the case with the blonde. It lacks the depth and complexity of the other trappist dubbels. Smells very malty and hay-ish with a little bit of dark candi-sugar fighting its way out of the rim of the chalice. The taste is nothing short of exceptional, though. It has been too long since I had a Belgian style beer that didn't taste like bananas and cloves, and that is one hell of a refreshment, though I've actually come to like that signature Chimay taste that everybody seems to want to mimic with their Belgian style brews. The taste is very well rounded. It is not too sweet and malty, not too tart, somewhat earthy. This is what a dubbel should taste like (also see: St. Bernardus and it's selection of dubbels). The mouthfeel is somewhat light, but its about right at where I like it for this style, if only it were just slightly more full. As is the case with any of the trappist ales I've had, I would absolutely love to drink this stuff all night if I could afford it and be able to handle the alcohol level (which is very well hidden I might add... completely indetectable by my tastebuds).","neonbrown82","Mar 31, 2005"

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"A hazy russet brown body swirls particles of yeast at the base of the goblet as its bubbles rise steadily to take their place beneath its full head of dark ivory froth. The head holds well, dropping slowly as you progress through the goblet, but leaves only minor lacing. The nose is more restrained than most of the beers from the other Trappist breweries, but it does offer some sweetish, sugar-cookie like malt, red grape-like fruitiness, and delicate alcohol. It's effervescent carbonation is fine enough (from bottle conditioning) that it tingles the tongue, rather than prickling it. And there's enough body to put it solidly in the "medium" category and smooth it out a bit as well. More fruit is present in the flavor (particularily in the finish), and the malt takes on more of a doughy character which gives it a little bit more depth, but the alcohol is also more intense. It lends a distinct peppery quality which teams with the spicy yeastiness to help balance the malt, but it's also a little bit hot as well. Additionally, some banana and hints of tropical fruit due to the higher alcohol esters become apparent as it warms but don't have enough intensity to lend any more depth to the beer. Instead, they kind of detract from what maltiness is there. Overall, it's a decent enough beer, but it's slightly out of balance with its higher alcohols and pales in comparison to their just slightly stronger Achelse Kluis (as well as many other Trappist and abbaye ales). A trepidacious thumbs up on this one... there are better beers available at better prices.","NeroFiddled","Apr 21, 2004"

The appearance, as whole, is satisfactory; the dandruff in the glass is annoying. Subsequent lacing was nonexistent. The nose is malty sweet with raisins, cola, airy pepper, sea salt and yeast; every other whiff or so I could get a hint of the alcohol. If it was more potent it might have been more inviting or at least exciting. The bouquet is a bit dull. The palate is much more enhanced than the nose indicated, apples, bananas, and pears upfront. In the middle it gets a little tart and some sweetness like a cola becomes more noticeable. A bit of toasty caramel and candied sugar finishes the beer. The aftertaste is awfully yeasty. Yuck. The flavors work well enough and it has moments of tastiness but they are few and far between. However the lack of body is too perceivable, itÂs medium-light at best and far too thin for a Dubbel. The carbonation is quite massive and bothersome. I donÂt think this aspect of the beer is any good at all. In fact IÂm not really impressed with any aspect of this beer. It is quite average.

The mouthfeel felt thin to me, and the taste just didn't seem all that great.","jlervine","Aug 03, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Murky brown, with lovely off white lasting head. Smelt of yeast, raisins, and a touch of orange and citrus aswell and perhaps some toffee. The palate was definitely yeasty, but nicely soft, rounded and long. Quite raisiny, with some late citrus orange, some nice late bitterness, and some slight acid.","rastaman","Jun 16, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured out a murky light brown with quite a bit of sediment. Smell was restrained, malty and sweet. Taste was good, slightly sugary with the raisiny fruity overtones I would expect, but without the robustness of a Rochefort. Overall a nicely drinkable beer, but for the price, I'll stick with a St Bernardus..","euskera","May 26, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a nebulous deep brown color, the head portly in size, frothy in structure, the color a light tan with the residual lace a nice coating upon the glass. Nose is a bit plummish, sweet malt, fresh and pleasant to the senses with a sweet malt start and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stingingly acidic, the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste and a nice warming sensation from the relatively high ABV, Quite a drinkable beer, and much better than the blond.","Gusler","May 24, 2003"
4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a very cloudy dark brown with some sediment present. It formed a nice off white bubbly head that left circular lace. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and a touch of cherry. A flavor of malt and caramel. The finish was a touch astrigent with a bit of sweetness to it. Overall I am not as big on dubbels as other styles of Belgians. But all in all, this is another nice beer from this brewer.","Wildman","Mar 29, 2003"
3.49,-15.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Maybe I just don't get Dubbel, but I don't particularly enjoy this. Best before date of May, 2004.","Realale","Feb 05, 2003"
4.3,4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A carefull pour produced a nearly crystal clear, deep, rosey amber color and a thick and foamy, off-white head with specks of lace trailing behind. Slightly musty aroma of apples and cherries steeped in alcohol with sharp, yeasty phenolic notes. Flavor is reminiscent of toasted rye bread with rock candy sweetness and subtle hints of fruit combined with dry, grassy hops. The finish is very dry and warm with cidery tartness. Remarkably balanced and drinkable.","Shiredave","Jan 24, 2003"
4.3,4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Damn good, but it's a step lower on the ladder than the Blonde of the same strength. Again, the alcohol is hidden quite well, making it go down way too easy. Whatever the monks at Achel are doing, they're doing it right. Damn good stuff...","MJR","Jan 13, 2003"
3.93,-4.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"It poured a beautiful copper color with very good foam. The aroma was modest, and mostly malt. The taste was sweet and malty -- nice. The mouthfeel was very nice: good carbonation, smooth, and crisp. The drinkability was good. A very good dark, strong ale.","UncleJimbo","Beers"
