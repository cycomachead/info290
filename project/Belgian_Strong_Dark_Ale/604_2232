Punches well above its weight in the ABV stakes, of course, but it has the flavour and mouthfeel to pull it off magnificently. Came as part of a case of 15 'random' beers and I'm glad it did. Excellent beer.","interzen","Feb 21, 2015"

4.04,0.2,3,4,4,4.5,4.25,"found the color a little curious. I expected a much darker beer and when it poured a burnt orangish color, I was wishing it was either a little darker or a little lighter. It did pour a nice thick head though. had held up and laced nicely. The aroma is very much a strong Belgian ale with hints to break, must, cheese, raisins. Now that I think of it sort of like a fruitcake, but maybe it’s the seasonal label influencing me. First sip a full mouth-feel and a noticeable alcohol tingle. Very sweet followed by a little bitterness. Nice alcohol burn and a little warmth in the cheeks. A very good Christmas beer. One to sip and enjoy on a cold night.","lstorie3","Dec 12, 2014"

4.35,7.9,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, rich, ruby-caramel coloring that is slightly murky, and starts with a frothy, bubbly, off-white head that quickly disappears. Slow trails of carbonation bubbles throughout the body of the beer. Aromas of grape, fig, raisin, and date on the forward bouquet, with earthy notes, cherry highlights, hints of booze, and a very subtle spice blend. Very rich and robust nose. Flavors are very rich and chewy forward, with lots of old world fruit and a heavy helping of warmth flourishing the taste buds. The rich and sweet notes blend terrifically, with heavy cherry and fig notes in the forefront. Very rich, robust, and heavy bodied beer, with a building warmth at the end of the palate. There is a sharpness that cuts through the end of the beer, likely a combination of the increased ABV and the carbonation. It truly helps to keep the drinkability up. Sweet candied notes in the aftertaste combine with the old world fruit characteristics, lightening them up a bit right before the slick, clean finish. It's really impressive how a beer this big clears the palate so quickly at the tail-end. Great beer!","GarthDanielson","Jan 12, 2014"

Pours cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big cherry, plum, raisin, apple, pear, caramel, candi sugar, clove, pepper, toast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big cherry, plum, pear, apple, raisin, caramel, candi sugar, toast, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of cherry, plum, pear, apple, raisin, caramel, candi sugar, toast, clove, pepper, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 30, 2013"

A thick white/cream head that fades rather quickly into no lacing and a cafe thin layer head over a dark amber cloudy liquid . Two years aging in simi optimal conditions. Smells of everything. Tastes of everything. Dates, bananas, chocolate, coffee, kiwi, ginger, nutmeg, curry (this is amazing!). Toasted marshmallow, orange bitters, a touch of cinnamon, slightly toasted/burnt cream/salted lemon/spiced cider/flan/a crisp tart/sweet potatoes. It is not as drinkable as it could possibly be: it is an amazing beverage that expresses its spiciness too much in combination with its slightly too high of level of syrupyness and sweetness. Balanced wonderfully, yet it does not yield itself to more than four glasses. An amazing beverage that should be tried by all who come accros it.","Eisen","Dec 25, 2013"

Rich aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, Belgian yeast and spicing. Wow, flavor is sweet caramel malt, pear, light and dark stone fruit, sweet syrup, bready Belgian yeast, cinnamon and clove; both warming and a bit boozy, almost reminiscent of a fruit liqueur. Sharp bitter finish with residual sweetness. Medium, creamy body. A warming, sweet, intensely flavored dark strong ale with all the Belgian spicing and yeast elements expected. Perhaps a bit on the boozy side, but if approached as a strong, but tasty sipper, perfect for the holidays. Definitely a candidate for aging to mellow out the alcohol.","LiquidAmber","Dec 17, 2013"

I smell a ton of dried fruit and booze in this, alcohol soaked raisins and plums come to mind, as well as a classic dried cherry sweetness. the malt is darker, but not black at all, caramel and amber, bready in taste, with very little real spice flavor in this at all, just a prominent Belgian yeast strain and then the booze. its not as complex as some, but its put together well and allows the yeast to be the star here. I think this has range all through winter, regardless of when the holidays are. if its cold out, this is a fine winter warmer. it finishes a little sweeter than I want it to, which makes it a bottle to pass around. well carbonated though, and one of those beers you sort of appreciate that the booze level isn't hidden at all. a reminder of the season.","StonedTrippin","Dec 11, 2013"

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, the alcohol wasn't overwhelming, and the flavors held my attention nicely, I think one would be enough for me, I know it's a pretty small bottle, but this beer is pretty potent and it's pretty damn sweet, so one would be all I would want. What I liked the most about this beer was it's complexity, it was the highlight of this beer and the mouthfeel was pretty damn good also. What I liked the least about this beer was expensive it is, if it was a little cheaper I would buy it more often. I recommend giving it a try if your in the mood for a big beer. I would buy this beer again, but probably only one bottle to have for the holidays, it's a little pricey, but it makes for a good and strong beer to celebrate the holidays with. All in all i was happy with this beer, it was good, but it didn't blow my mind. This is my first time having anything from this brewery and it made for a good first impression and I would be willing to try more of their beers. This made for a good beer to celebrate my 500th review with, it's been a fun two and a half years and I don't see an end in site, Cheers to BA and good beer.","StoutHunter","Dec 09, 2012"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear garnet-ruby populated by floaties and topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-khaki foam. The nose comprises light red grapes, light fig, light dark wheat, very light clove, and a vague sense of Belgian yeast. In case you didn't pick up on the theme, everything is faint to my 'strils (though things intensify a bit with some time, but not by very much). The taste brings in more of the same, along with a mild vein of candied orange peel and a strong alcohol presence. So strong, in fact, that it's fairly oppressive. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, if you can get past the blast of booze, this ain't too bad a BSDA, if a touch ordinary.","TMoney2591","Nov 22, 2012"

Color was a deep reddish-amber (truth in advertising) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was hot with the alcohol really prevalent along with notes of dried, dark fruit. Mouthfeel was medium and the heat was pretty intense initially and as it faded, it tasted like liquid fruitcake. Finish was sweet, very fruity, almost vinous in its flavor profile. I am not sure just how I feel about this one. I know that the 8.48 fluid ounce serving size was just about right as too much of this could be too much. I also think that if it comes in a corked and caged format, cellaring might be in order to knock down some of the heat.","woodychandler","Nov 12, 2012"

Rich with dark fruit and malts - plum, toffee, burnt sugar, molasses, figgy pudding (just kidding). Good balance between sweet and dry/bitter. Some spice adds complexity - clove, coriander, and nutmeg flavors. Alcohol definitely flexes, but not too much for the style. This would definitely knock me out on Christmas Eve. A Belgian Dark Strong with an English Barleywine slant. Good for the occasional treat. I might pick up a few for cellaring if only it was bottle conditioned.","bump8628","Jun 18, 2012"

3.41,-15.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a multifaceted, murky amber color. Red and brown hues lurk within the haze. Cream-colored head is meager but has a nice, fine texture (probably could have used a more vigorous pour). Aroma is mainly fruit and alcohol. I think I noticed some apple up front, but the bouquet is pretty amalgamated, so who really knows. The flavor is medicinal and furiously alcoholic, with what tastes like caramel malt attempting to add some semblance of balance. The net effect is something akin to cough syrup, but not as objectionable. The warmth of the alcohol lingers for ages in the back of the mouth, while sweet malt lends a stickiness to the lips over time. Difficult to drink in anything other than tiny sips over the long haul; not for the faint of heart.","MaximalC","May 08, 2012"

The aroma is very sweet and caramelly and I also found some sediments that I am not fond of though understand it's purpose. Christmasy spices like aniseed and licorice are quite obvious. Tha flavor is sweet, caramelly, syrupy, fruitish and alcohol is warming in the finish. Very low bitterness. Caramel is dominating, but it still isn´t too sweet. The palate is almost full bodied, quite soft and slightly alcoholic. Sugary and sicky on the lips. I am going against the grain on this one with my rating.","CuriousMonk","Jan 27, 2011"

The smell is dominated by alcohol, pale Belgian malt, and spice (coriander). There's plenty of peppery, spicy phenols in the smell as well. The taste is initially sweet, followed by a serious alcohol warmth (hotness perhaps). Malt and candy...sweetness and alcohol...these are the themes in this beer.

A pleasent blend of hops. it still hasnt stopped bubbling by the way... im getting a little bit of lemon with it. for a 12 % ABV this is pretty drinkable. drink one of these and you could have a slight buzz going. after finishing this had to pull the drinkablility down .5% because this has a really bitter finish. but really not bad","IIKaRuII","Jan 02, 2011"

More flavors emerged like figs, dates, white fermenting raisins and cognac. Beer should have had more carbonation or none at all.

I made the mistake of pouring the "floaties" in this, I'll know better next time. Smells of cloves, definitely raisins, fruit, spice, & malty brown candy sugar. If this is even detectable or possible, the beer smells complex. The taste...ahhh...the taste! All I can say is, "Wow", pretty amazing. Detecting prunes, raisins, faint vanilla, a slight touch of orange (very slight), brown sugar. Medium body, creamy smooth finish and a warming down the throat from the boozy character of this high octane seasonal. I really wrestled with aging this bottle for a year but couldn't wait, I love the Scaldis brews and didn't have the willpower for the aging process. This is very drinkable and on an empty stomach, it's pretty much kicking my butt. I couldn't imagine a bottle bigger than the tiny 8.5 oz'r it came in.

Spot on candied fruit flavor, big on the honey, light butterscotch. Moderate body with active carbonation that helps cut any syrupy feel.

Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent quarter-inch skim. Thick swaths of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose is dark fruit (prunes/figs, perhaps some grapes), some brown sugar, maybe a touch of yeast. Taste follows nose with the addition of a slightly bready quality. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a light carbonation - a very nice and warming mouthfeel without being boozy. Alcohol is well-hidden at 12% I have to say - closer to 8% or 9% in my opinion if I were to hazard a guess. Very tasty, but fairly steep at $4.49 a bottle.","Jwale73","Dec 12, 2009"

The musty, dank, basement aroma, mixed with old prunes, raisins, and heavy malt, might petrify the newcommer. It's alcoholic prune flavours, mixed with butterscotch, maple, and floral hops might scare even the purest of heart. But here it is, in its purest form. A belgian strong ale for the avid beer fan.

A bit less than I expected from such a hyped beer, but it was certainly a memorable smell. The taste was good but, again, not what I was hoping for; relateively malty, spicy, and yeasty -- not as complex as I was expecting.

Aromatic and complex nose consists of dark fruits (plum?), white grapes, green apples, strawberry?, and sweet malts/grains blended well with green/spicy hops. The first sip unveils the strength with a large warming sensation, but also reveals raspberry, a touch of maraschino, light caramel, some powdery yeast, and an increasing hop presence that imparts a mild bitterness and a grassy finish.

My bottle says 13% while a lot of people report different percentages on theirs so not sure about that. If I lived somewhere where it was really cold this would be great to sip on a cold night.

Big fruity malt range; plum, dates, raisons, licorice in spots, and orange. Alcohol is pretty hot but it does warm you up inside. Some sourness into the finish and gives up a little medicinal character. Overall a consistent cherry, sherry flavor thats more distinguished in the finish, has the feel of port wine.

4.62,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Poured from a small bottle into a Westmalle chalice, the Noel is an amberish brown with a surprisingly large sized off-white head (for the ABV) with medium bubbles that left a sticky, clingy lace, but with very little carbonation. The aroma is mainly sweet malt and fusal alcohol, with a bit of grape and almond. The taste is very well balanced, and not nearly as boozy as the aroma would lead one to believe, primarily malty but with a nice sweet, nutty character that is exceptionally smooth, some caramel and grapes, with a touch of toffee. Served at about 55F, there is very little aftertaste, and an exceptionally rich, creamy, yet medium body that is highly drinkable. I was hoping for a bit more Belgian yeast complexity, but for the execution of such a strong beer, the Scaldis is really impressive. However, there is not much in the way of the traditional Noel spice flavors, so if your looking for lots of nutmeg and anise, you won't find it here. Still, this Noel is exceptional, probably more so because it doesn't rely on the spices...","ccrida","Feb 04, 2007"

Superb foam retention and thick walls of lacing coat almost the entire chalice as it drains. Aroma was pleasant, but somewhat underwhelming for a big holiday Belgian like this. Nice notes of ripe light fruits, cookie dough, biscuits, raisins and brown sugar are expereinced, but they seem quite reserved for one and the alcohol really shows way too much punch in the nose. Mouthfeel is very nice; crisply and lively carbonated with a slightly firm, thick finish. Flavor profile turns out to be a bit more pleasing than the aroma, but still a bit tame for a beer of this magnitude and style. Flavors of toffee, light caramel candies, licorice, brown sugar and vanilla wafers with a slight hint of banana are enjoyed. However, again the alcohol seems to play too much of a dominant role here as in the nose. Finish is sweet with just a touch of an earthy/herbal hop presence.

Palate is deeply complex and sweet - dark Belgian malt, raisins, figs, brown sugar, and a touch of spciy yeast are evident.

This ale has a complex aroma and intoxicating creme brulee aroma that fades away too quickly. The first slick sip is full of sugary malt sweetness. A slight fruitiness emerges towards the middle, followed by a warming, bitter, finish. Really outstanding. I'm a bit surprised by the almost over-the-top bitterness in the finish. Almost drinks like a fine, spiced liqeur. Frighteningly easy to consume for a quadrupel.

Beer is light sienna in color with near-amber highlights; possibly the lightest-colored quadrupel I've ever seen. After swirling the slightly viscous fluid, the head leaves behind a bit of webby lace, but nothing inspiring. No visible carbonation. Aroma is orangy and alcoholic... Grand Marnier with a lighter nosefeel--bullseye! Hints of cinnamon and lemon bread, with a finish of dry reeds. Very nice. Sip quickly though, because the alcohol will start to take over fast. First tastes are honeyish, alcoholic, almost mead-like; with more bitter orange peels, as in the aroma. There's an unusual aspect to the sweetness, however, that reminds me of sloe gin; and the hops seem especially grassy... fine for a Belgian Pale Ale, but here...? Again, alcohol really starts to become a flavor of its own--especially in the aftertaste--after the first few sips. Mouthfeel is full, semi-dry, and tingling with alcohol.

There is a nice hoppiness to this beer, despite the intense maltiness that defines this beer. The hops add a nice spicy note to this beer, as well a nicely bitter contribution in the finish. This beer has subtle notes of butterscotch, concentrated raisin, biscuits, caramelized malt, a hint of cinnamon, tangerine, and a grassy herbal zing.

The nose is enticing with notes of sweet dried cherries and dark caramel. It's delicately vibrant across the tongue with a carbonation that lightly tickles the tongue before allowing its light-medium body to become just slightly creamy. The flavor delivers the same cherry-like fruitiness and sweet caramel that the nose promises along with some floral and grassy hops and a decent slap of spicy alcohol that bursts onto the back of the mouth and tongue at the swallow. The caramel lingers in the mildly sweet finish with the alcohol doing more to dry it than the sublime bitterness that's present. And yet, the alcohol never overcomes or dulls the palate!

There was a nice balance of the alcohol and the fruitiness of it all. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thick side, which is to be expected with a strong beer like this, and drinkability isn't rated too high because it is 12%abv, so more than one bottle in a sitting would probably get old.

Early June and there I was ordering a Scaldis Noel, yeah it was weird in my mind to order this beer during June but it was the special. This beer poured into my snifter with a ruby amber brown color with a full caramel toned aromatic head, and the added eye candy of lace clinging to the edges of my glass. Aroma full of dark roasts, deep tones of caramelized brown sugar, and nutmeg along with some other festive spices very good aroma here. Flavor, this is a winter warmer in my book, but definitely was a nice change up from typical summer beers. Full array of spices along with sweet fruit tones that blend harmoniously together, and well this beer just works try it. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated fuller body, and this beer is not too cloying very good year round beer not just a winter warmer. Very drinkable beer just between 12% alcohol by volume and the high amount of carbonation, I will go for something else after I am through with one of these.","WVbeergeek","Jun 03, 2003"

4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall a Christmas beer worth trying but I agree with the others a bit overpriced $4.99 for a small bottle. But dummies like me buy it, so It's not going to get any less expensive.","StevieW","Apr 07, 2003"
4.04,0.2,3,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours with a virtually non-existant head, over cloudy amber liquid (lots of yeast floaters abound). The nose is predominantly havy malt with noticeable alcohol, and hops. The taste is very hoppy/bitter...pleasantly so! An alcoholic/liquor-ish warmth follows with lots more maltiness in the background. Finishes with a just-as-strong bitterness from the massive hopping they give this ale to balance out the heavy maltiness & alcoholic power. A "send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' home drunk"-type of ass-kicker! God bless Belgium.","beerluvr","Mar 30, 2003"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"However, the large grape/wine flavor, and the 12% ABV make me wonder how a glass of 14% Shiraz doesn't smack me up like Scaldis does?","feloniousmonk","Feb 06, 2003"
4.15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Nice amber colour. Spicey/sweet nose. Malty up front followed by a nice sweetness hinted by caramel & molasses and spicey, almost pepper finsh with an alcohol kick. Good sipping beer. Gets you warm fast so don't drink too quickly. Quite enjoyable. A pefect match for the christmas season.","Popsinc","Jan 07, 2003"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a garnet/brownish color. The off-white colored head is small but creamy; settles to a good lace. On the nose you first get a whiff of the 12% abv., some spiciness, peppery, caramel malt, and some dark fruits. On the palate the flavors were of dark fruits, spicy, peppery, alcohol, good sweetness, clove, and caramel. Good brew","WilliamPhilaPa","Jan 04, 2003"
4.32,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Hazy brown liquid with white suds ringing the glass. Very rich, malty aroma with some alcohol, peaches, and spicy hops in the nose. Great toasted malt flavor and some caramel somewhere in there, too. Some hop flavor provides the right amount of balance but still leaves this beer way on the malty side. Body was thinner and carbonation higher then expected, but so what. The alcohol was very noticeable (not in a bad way) and warming. A good beer overall, but I think Ill stick with Samichlaus as my big winter beer from a little bottle, for now at least.","yen157","Jan 01, 2003"
4.25,5.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A very nice winter treat (and I'll simply ignore the fact that winter is gone and it's in the 70s today...). Deep copper with a rocky white head. Aroma of orange, coriander, pepper, clove, and apples. Sweet malty taste, mixed with tart apples and spices. Moderate carbonation and high alcolhol create a spicy finish. Not a beer you want to guzzle!","mophie","Apr 20, 2002"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pleasantly semi-dark and delicious. A bit more carbonated than I expected and more so than the regular Scaldis. Ripe plums, raisins, a touch of dark roasted malt, alcohol warming and subdued hops round out the experience. One to gently sip and savour.","John","Jan 03, 2002"
4.4,9.2,4,4,5,4,4,"Creamy and deceiving, slightly sweet and peppery alcohol slowly warms the body. Big caramel and dark fruit flavours with hints of phenols that are almost bubble gum in taste. I'll have to go back to this one several times this winter being that one little bottle was not enough.","Jason","Dec 08, 2001"
