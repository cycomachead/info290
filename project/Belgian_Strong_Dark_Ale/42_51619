Nice aroma hitting on a touch of orange - I didn't pick up on the other spices listed on the label.  Taste:  another reviewer mentioned mustiness which is spot on but unfortunately it was a negative for me.  Overall this one grew on me by the time I finished but the first 8 oz were just OK-- perhaps the 10% ABV was talking down the stretch.","RossiDaMan","Mar 08, 2015"

4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it seems to be pretty inline with the style and I liked that the brewery calls this a Dark Winter Ale, it's not very dark, but for Belgian standards it kind of is and it goes well with the winter weather.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little creamy, crisp, just slightly prickly, the alcohol was hidden well, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, but with how well the alcohol is hidden i wouldn't rule out have two of them.  What I like the most about this beer was how well the different aspect worked with each other, I thought the Belgian yeast worked well with the dark fruit flavors.  What I liked the least about this beer was that more of those toasted malt flavors didn't come through in the taste, but it wasn't a big deal.  I would buy this beer again and I'm interested to see how it ages.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes the stronger Belgian Ales.  All in all I was happy with this beer, now that I've tried it on a fresh palate I think I like it just a little less since I've last had it, but it's still a good beer that I enjoyed drinking and I think it's fitting for the season.  This isn't my favorite Ommegang beer or my favorite beer of the style, but it's not bad in any aspect.  Good job guys, this was a tasty winter seasonal, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Nov 19, 2014"

It's not as complex as the aforementioned styles, and is more fruity than malty. This is, of course, the major difference in styles of Barleywine to Belgian Strong Dark, and I enjoy those styles a bit more. That being said, it's very good for the style. A great sipping beer for a cold winter night. The warming in the throat and chest mixed with the cidery spice is enough to keep me coming back for more during the season. Good spice, good mixture of flavor, and it's as smooth as could be.","Jaysauras","Nov 17, 2014"

The beer itself is an opaque brown with a hints of red and light purple. The color is close to that of a lighter plum color. The beer smell has sweet dark fruits notes and bready yeast notes as well. The beer also has a very subtle alcohol note along with a slight caramel taste. However, the dark fruit notes such as plum, a little bit of grape, and nectarine dominate the smell. The taste is similar but the taste also has some Belgian sugar notes. The yeast notes are stronger and counteract the dark fruit tastes very well. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation but is still very smooth. Overall, a good beer and one worth getting when you can. I can certainly see why this thing would warm someone up at night.","HattedClassic","May 22, 2014"

The smell is all burnt sugars, spices and an enticing booziness that is not too strong. The taste follows the nose but as it warms it takes on the character of candy canes that have a more herbal than just peppermint flavor - which might sound a little odd but was really delightful. Some banana and spicy notes given off from the yeast I suppose. Large bouquet of earthy herbal notes in the flavor. Very easy to drink and hard to find the alcohol in there - it was nice and thick but with tighter bubbles that helped it not be cloying. Maybe my new favorite from ommegang - really great stuff.","jwchestnut","Feb 18, 2014"

Pours moderately cloudy reddish copper color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and rocky light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big plum, pear, raisin, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, coriander, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of yeast, malt, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, pear, apple, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toast, coriander, clove, pepper, licorice, brown bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toast, coriander, clove, licorice, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of robust malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, crisp, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent spiced Belgian strong ale! All around awesome complexity, balance, and robustness of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 30, 2013"

Seasonal aroma of Belgian yeast, sweet bready malt and lots of spicing, primarily cinnamon and cardamom, some dark dried fruit. Flavor is rich dark fruit, orange, faint citrus, sweet bready malt, Belgian yeast, cardamom and clove, hints of alcohol. Medium bodied, slightly syrupy. A nice spiced Belgian strong dark ale, leaning towards the sweet end; the dense mixed fruit and spicing are quite appropriate for the Winter season, reminiscent of a mulled wine.

Nose is surprisingly light for a winter beer like this with so many exotic ingredients which one might normally think would lead to a very aromatic beer. The glory of this beer is solely on the palate as far as I'm concerned because it has a savory sweetness that is a little malty and a lot of caramel, but then rounded out by a nice mixture of holiday spices. There's plenty of complexity. Easy drinking, very easy drinking, and it goes down like a 6% beer would... not some 10% monster. I'm skeptical that the ABV is accurate because it is so incredibly imperceptible.","yemenmocha","Nov 14, 2013"

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, sweet alcohol, raisin, and subtle toasted bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, wood, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The notes of dark fruit going on in this one really tied everything together and made it quite enjoyable throughout each sip. There was a nice touch of sweet alcohol as well which reminded you what you were drinking. This was fairly nice for the style. Really glad I got the chance to tick it on tap and I suggest you at least do the same once.","thagr81us","May 14, 2013"

Tastes spicy up front with yeast, malt, orange peel, coriander, cinnamon and spices like a heavy Belgian that seemed unbalanced. Almost tastes skunky from all the winter spices (pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.), with mild carbonation that had an overall heavy feel to it.

Some malty notes are overwhelmed by dark fruit, clove, cinnamon, and Belgian yeast. Dark fruits are very heavy on the pallet, cherry, fig, and raisin hints blend very well with some spice and brown sugar. The alcohol, 10%, is very well masked in this medium bodied, medium-high carbonated winter warmer. Love this brewery!","phishsihq","Feb 25, 2012"

There is a small heat from the alcohol, but 10% ABV it tastes not. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an appetizingly dry finish. Overall, a fine winter warmer from Ommegang, but the presence of the Belgian yeast and traditional spices break it from the category.

Lots of yeast and spices coming through, with ample ethanol heat on the back end. Definitely hitting at a good balance but it's a little rough around the edges. Medium body, good mouthfeel except the alcohol comes in a bit strong, especially as the beer warms.

It has kind of a sweet aroma, with notes of raisins, prunes, cherries, figs and lots of spices. It's pretty full bodied and quite smooth. The finish is tidy. It tastes pretty sweet, fruity and spicy. It's kind of like a spice cake, with lots of dried fruit, especially prune. As it warms up, the cardamom really comes out. It reminds me of Trois Pistoles, but spiced.

But it was once I took a sip that everything really came together for me. A wave of cascading brown sugar and tart apples just rolled across the tongue. Enormously rich and vigorous, this was just a wonderful thing to behold. Nice touches of chocolate and rich toffee like notes were all balanced well in advance of a lovely dark fruit tone that led the charge once the yeast kicked in.

This stuff has a radiant rusty, near cherry colored copper appearance with a pretty flimsy topping that offers some modest signs of lacing. The aroma is a beautifully pungent cherry brandy with apple nutmeg sweetness, deep and near candy-like and even a touch of Dr. Pepper and fruit nougat. Really captivating. The taste buds receive bright liquid oak and brandy with ideas of nutmeg-clove, vanilla malt and light cherry-rhubarb. Alcohol is notable but not overpowering. It has peppery edges with very delicate but effective carbonation. The feel is also near brandy-like, medium-heavy bodied, fairly thick but just a bit more watery so as to invite more than just sipping despite the hefty ABV. Alcohol releases at the finish and more of the oak barrel kind of qualities seem evident. Though drinkable enough, this seems like it's enjoyed best as a single serving.

A ton of delicious apple along with spice and nutmeg. The apple smell is what differentiates the bottle from the tap. The apple smell is so different and distinct in the bottle tasting. I can't remember a belgian ale I have had that has so much fruit fragrance in it. It is just terrific. The taste is of more nutmeg, spice and cinnamon. A little bit of light fruit in the taste as well. This beer is very smooth and creamy, but there is no doubt it is a 10% beer.

But, it doesn't quite live up to a lot of other holiday releases out there (especially the Belgian styles). Its biggest problem is that it's one dimensional. For a Belgian style, that's not a good thing. The holiday spice presence tends to dominate some of the other aspects, rather than complement them. More Belgian yeast and less spices sounds like the right ticket. Nonetheless, it's pretty good. Definitely worth picking up at least once.","prototypic","Jan 28, 2011"

Medium sized tan foamy head, with good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is caramel malts, oranges, bananas, bread, cardamom, yeasty and sweet. A medium to full bodied Belgian Strong Ale. The malts are fruity and sweet, banana and clove, orange and coriander. There is a bunch of sugar like sweetness as well. The hops are earthy and spicy. The spicing is interesting, coriander, mace, cardamom, and orange peel are all noticeable and mix and match nicely with the sweet malts, if they weren't there this beer would be way too sweet. Nice lively carbonation. Nice winter ale. Meant to be sipped slowly, perhaps in front of a roaring fire (be sure you have a fireplace!). Hides the alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet with some spices.","CuriousMonk","0"

There's a bitter and slightly metallic flavor that I notice more than anything else, although it's not too overpowering. Orange peel, dark fruit, and spice flavors are also noticable.

The taste I found however to be great on my first sip, but then wildly overwhelming as the spices built upon my tongue. Even when sipping this beer the spices can sneak up on you. I personally had trouble drinking this, and the consensus of the group was that this would be better if after every sip you could clear your palate.

Just a real spicy, fruity aroma; the coriander, clove, peeper are all able to be pointed out as well as a yeast twang, orange peel and citric notes and some dry, bready malt. Unbelievably spicy yet sweet are the first words that come to mind to describe taste. That and for a 10% beer the alcohol doesn't overpower anything at all and isn't even that strong on the backbite. It's like eating a cinnamon sugar cookie; there's a real sugary sweetness that could be desrcibed as cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger and sharp/spicy as clove and coriander perk up. A thicker medium body that could be described as slightly creamy, this beer also has a dry edge to it thanks to some roasted-like malts and a very noticeable citric (orange/banana) fruit flavor. ABV more noticable as it warms and it is definitely a sipper but one that anyone should try.","clayrock81","Nov 28, 2010"

Also taste some anise and the medicinal astringency. This is a big tasting beer - nothing sublte about this at all. The most redeeming factor for me is the mouthfeel. Very thick and smooth, this lends itself to gulping. Drinkability is a toss up. It goes down easy enough, but the aftertaste lingers, and is not pleasant. Jager anyone? As a winter warmer, this beer cannot be faulted. The alcohol is prominant, and is indeed warming. It is simply a question of how much herbal sweetness you can stomach in a beer.

Well integrated while showing itself. More roasted malts and dark flavorful breads with a cocoa liqueur as it lingers on my palate. Phantom overripe banana. Spiced as well. Feel is prickly and tingly carbonation with a just enough heft to satisfy.

3.97,-2.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Thanks for sharing Jon. Great aromas, the mace abd ornange, ginger and yeast. Big head and lacey. Taste is decent, complexity of spices, pepper including black,cardamon,ginger,corriander, cloves, a littl chocolate, slows down drinkability to a sipper. Average plus mouthfeel.","Sammy","Nov 16, 2009"

4.3,5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful dark fruit and spice aroma. It has a kick ass warming crystal malt scent with bits of orange peel and cardamom as well. The taste is awesome. It has an incredibly smooth flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with an excellent selection of spices that really compliment the dark fruit flavor of the Belgian yeast esters. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good beer. It's adequately spiced as well as having a great malt bill.","WesWes","Nov 13, 2009"

4.75,16.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Ommegang's new Christmas offering is a must try for any Belgian dark ale fan. First had the chance to try this one at the sneak preview at the Craft Beer Fest and have been anxiously awaiting it's release ever since. Adoration did not disappoint. Enjoyed out of the bottle in a chalise. Pours a dark orangy amber with not a ton of head. Smell is rich and malty sweet with just a hint of sugary citrus. The first sip reminds you that this beer is 10%, but the alcohol does not overpower the other flavors. A nice sweet, spicy flavor with stronger notes of the orange peel and correander. The finish is smooth and sweet with those candy sugars. Very smooth, rich and full mouthfeel. It's definitely a beer to be appreciated over a long period of time, the flavor gets better as it breathes and warms up. The name is fitting, any belgian strong ale fan will adore this beer.","icemanrulz","Nov 10, 2009"

3.98,-2.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall this is another nice one from Ommegang. It's a little different, and that certainly makes it worth trying. Great for a cold winter's night, spicy and warming. I have another bottle of this I'll be saving for a night closer to the holidays.","frothyhead","Oct 31, 2009"
3.97,-2.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a Belgian Dark Ale brewed in the Belgian Winter style, so it is a spiced beer. Pours a hazy dark copper, light brown color with a 1/2 finger off white head with good retention leaving light patchy lacing. Spicy and fruity aromas- ginger, corriander, orange, cherry and candy sugar. The up front taste is of the spices, mainly ginger and corriander with some others mixed in which lead to some light hop bitterness and yeast with some vanilla with the spices fading out. Medium high carbonation, medium body there is a nice clean mouthfeel. Quite drinkable, the alcohol is noticeable but very smooth for 10%. The balancing of spice flavors is very nicely done.","scottg","Oct 30, 2009"
3.67,-10.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"taste is smooth, spice, prunes, raisins, red grapes, pepper, some caramel, and a touch of cocoa, ends dry and a little bitter.","froghop","Oct 30, 2009"
4.3,5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I had a taste or two of this at the recent BA Belgian fest in Boston, glad to see it today at DeCiccos's in Ardlsey, NY. $13.99 for the typical Omme. caged and corked Belgian style bomber. (w/o vintage dating BTW.) Dark brown, cloudy, darker khaki head, huge initially, slowly, slowly turning to a thicker film, collar and then respectable larger blots of lace. Sweet malty nose with hints of rum, raisins, figs, dark ripe fruit. BSDA in feel, tasty and personality. More sweet malt, rum notes, raisins, figs, light smoke, chocolate, thoroughly delicious, w/ 10% nowhere in sight. Complex, tasty and oh so wintery good. High quality sipper. Seek out and enjoy","Billolick","Oct 20, 2009"
4.62,13,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Outstanding. When winter comes, this is exactly what I want. Im going to go and raid the store and sock some away for a few more winters.","JasonA","Oct 17, 2009"
4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Pretty neat stuff but maybe a touch too spicy. I liked it though.","Viggo","Oct 17, 2009"
2.38,-41.8,4,3.5,1.5,3,2,"Sorry to be a downer, but I would avoid this one and pick up Hennepin, Biere de Mars, Ommegeddon, or any of Ommegang's other spectacular brews.","DanielClouser","Aug 04, 2009"
4.1,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"The current version is probably the most Belgain-like beer I've had from Ommegang to date.","John_M","Beers"
3.38,-17.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D - A strong dark Belgian that didn't win me over, might just have been the climate, but it has too much liquer effect with alcohol overdone, not one I would try again unless they sell it in bottles most likely.","Slatetank","0"
