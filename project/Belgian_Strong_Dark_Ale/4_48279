4.25,2.7,,,,,,"I would have never guessed this beer is as strong as it is, seems so smooth and mild. having not had the base black in awhile, I am amazed how different this seems to be. a whole lot less Belgian and a whole lot more barrel. the bourbon flavors are dominant while the mouthfeel is extremely soft and velvety and almost delicate for such a big brew. dark chocolate and caramel malt comprise the bulk of the grain character, but the bourbon is a major contributor to flavor. vanilla and charred oak compliment the beer nicely, but I am missing much of the belgian yeast character I seem to remember from black. not a bad thing, just a big difference. on tap at the farmhouse in Burlington after a recent allagash event. lucky to have tried this in that format, just beautiful beer from one of the premier producers on American soil.","StonedTrippin","Aug 13, 2014"

The nose is subtle but dark chocolate, Belgian yeast, light bourbon and oak, some dark fruits and as it warms I am picking up on the coconut. The taste is wonderful - much lighter on the bourbon character than other BA'ed beer, which was great - not overdone, but added subtlety to an already favorite of mine - sweet dark malts, dark and milk chocolates and Belgian peppery and spicy yeast but with an added layer of bourbon, oak and burnt sugars. Really enjoyed this. I found the mouth-feel was a little richer and smoother than the light body of the regular Black. All in all really wonderful and thankful to have stumbled across this.","jwchestnut","Feb 15, 2014"

The aroma is a little lighter than expected. Not too much bourbon to the nose. Bready, chocolate, roastiness, some pine and citrus hops. The taste is very good. The bourbon flavor is more subdued than some other bourbon barrel aged beers that I’ve had. Chocolate, some roastiness, somewhat bitter. Touch of sweetness in finish.

Perhaps it will in a bottle that's aged but this review is of a glass I had on tap from a not at all aged keg. Poured a brownish, almost black body, with one finger tan head that died slow and left some lace down glass. Strong malty aroma of roasted malts, some dark chocolate and there is a alcohol, bourbon like aroma with some wood in there. This is where I find this version slightly below the standard from regular black, as the strong roasted and wood type malts and flavors overpower, even while smoothing out this fuller bodied beer, the minor sweet malts (caramel, chocolate) and the hopiness and dark fruit flavors. It is more of a coffee or javalike sweetness and bitter chocolate all while going down easy than a balanced Belgian ale with sweetness and touches of yeast, hops and fruit flavors. Still would recommend this anyone who enjoyed the Black but just thought this effort was just off the mark.","clayrock81","Jun 21, 2013"

Light on the roast and no real trace of yeast. Very smooth, well-integrated flavors like Belgian chocolate, tobacco, rich malt, and creamy vanilla. I don't go crazy for bourbon barrel aged beers in general, as frequently I find them to be over the top, eclipsing the base beer with straight whiskey booze. This was beautifully done, the bourbon being subtle and working with the dark maltiness of Black, making it superior to the original in my eyes. Medium bodied and silky smooth. Not hot or boozy at all. This was the final beer I had during a rather satisfying evening of special and/or draft-only Allagash brews, and this was the surprise winner for me. I look forward to finding it again...","wedge","Mar 18, 2013"

This beer isn't about being slapped upside the head and dragged into a back alley, it's about being seduced. Each flavor seamlessly progresses to the next, and nothing is overdone. Through the artistry of the brewer, and a deft hand with barrel aging, this beer has been crafted into a unified whole that emits a siren song that keeps you coming back for another quaff. Entirely too drinkable for the abv, and altogether very pleasant.","Georgiabeer","Jul 10, 2012"

Flavors are extremely smooth and balanced, with raisin, date, and fig sweetness, bourbon and earthy backbone, and a sharp, slightly bitter tone at the end of the palate.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, wood, sweet alcohol, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, wood, subtle sweet alcohol, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had this one awhile back while at Brewvival this year and I remembered it being pretty good, so I jumped on the opportunity to try it again. The growler version of this one had quite a nice nose and flavor profile going on in it.

The smell of a nice roasted stout blended with a light vanilla aroma was very pleasing on the nose. The taste of the beer was really well balanced with the bourbon flavors and the roasted malts.

Loved the balance between the nice roasted flavors of the stout and the sweet and tangy flavors from the bourbon. A perfect melding of the two flavors.

3.55,-14.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark brown (surprising considering the name) with a creamy head. Good aromas of oak, chocolate malt, and Belgian yeast. Nice and roasty with good Belgian stout flavors, but not getting much Bourbon, which is a shame. Slightly creamy, with a medium body and crisp carbonation. Not bad, but where the heck is the Bourbon?","jsanford","Feb 12, 2011"
4.15,0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"There's not much I really have to say about this beer that I haven't already conveyed in my review of the straightforward Allagash Black. It's clearly aged in Bourbon barrels (although since I had it on tap I wasn't aware of that until I tasted it). I'd remembered liking the Black because it wasn't overdone. It was soft, and supple, and relaxed, and to be honest, this is very much the same. The Bourbon is not overblown at all, and it simply adds some Bourbon flavor, a bit of wood, and a light note of vanilla. Does it help the already complex "Black"? Probably not. If anything, it may distract you from the subtle nuances that were already there. But it IS an interesting change. And to a certain extent, it becomes almost like another beer, rather than just a beer that's been "Bourbon barrel aged". I like them both equally, and I can't choose one over the other. That would simply depend on my mood. So, with that said, I'd say it's worth trying to be sure. Especially for those who enjoy Bourbon barrel aged beers. And on that note let me add one more thought: given that it's a Bourbon barrel beer, I still found it quite drinkable, which is not always the case. Nicely done with a restrained hand. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Feb 07, 2011"

The beer smells like bourbon soaked dates and plums. It has sweet bourbon notes, along with dark fruit, vanilla, and oak. It has a warming, lingering finish. The body is medium, light carbonation.

Aroma is mild in strength and dominated by bourbon, vanilla and oak. Very smooth and subtle, but a little boring. Flavor is bourbon forward without being overly boozy or sweet. Finish is slightly bitter and astringent, with a mild dark fruit flavor and oak sweetness. Body is thick and silky smooth with minimal carbonation. Overall this isn't bad but was disappointgly boring and the base beer is overwhelmed by the barrel aging. Yawn.","yourefragile","Aug 15, 2010"

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Come for the Founders goodies, stay for the other goodies they've got assembled for your enjoyment. This one pours a very dark opaque black-brown topped by a half-finger (at best) of ecru macro-foam. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, dull chocolate, roasted malts, toffee, and a hint o' vanilla in there somewhere. The taste is very similar, with more chocolate and roasted malts and the inclusion of newcoming molasses. The body is a solid medium, with a slightly biting carbonation and a spitefully smooth feel. Overall, a very nice Belgian stout; doesn't overdo it with the bourbon barrel influences, and everything melds together very nicely.","TMoney2591","Jul 27, 2010"
3.92,-5.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"For what it is, this was a very pleasant surprise and not gimmicky at all. Served in a snifter; black in appearance, with a thin white head. Strong aromas of bourbon, oak and vanilla go along with roasted malts. It tastes very much like it smells, with the high alcohol content and the bourbon barrel flavors combining to give the impression you are, in fact, drinking bourbon. But this is not a harsh drink, because there are also complementary malt flavors and a rich, smooth mouthfeel. This works well in small quantities, with dessert or as a digestif.","malloyca","Jul 26, 2010"

4.28,3.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Reviewed from my notes, served in a tulip glass at the Great Lost Bear. The beer is a black liquid with a tan foam head. I can see foam and small bubbles rising within the dark liquid. There is a great layer of foam coating left behind as I drink the beer. I can distinguish some sweet malts in the aroma. There isn't much bourbon character here, it is more of an oak aroma. The taste of the beer begins with a a little sweet caramel up front. I can also taste creamy chocolate. A roasted coffee bitterness comes through in the finish. There is a little bit of the bourbon, but not much. What is there is present throughout. Based on the casked version of Curieux I have had in previously, I expected a lot more bourbon flavor--I'm slightly disappointed the bourbon isn't stronger. It has a medium body and feels creamy. There is just the right amount of foamy carbonation. This beer feels like a great example of a stout and a great example of a casked beer. For a Bourbon barrel-aged big stout, this beer is remarkably drinkable. Each sip is satisfying, but leaves me excited to have another. The 7.5% ABV is completely masked. I could easily drink a number of glasses of this beer.","ToasterChef","Jul 02, 2010"
4.08,-1.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Nose is lightly roasted, with hints of those vanilla beans and bourbon casks. Slightly soapy as well, lowering the score a half tick. The taste profile is great - the vanilla and bourbon mix seamlessly with the roasted malt. Some chocolate notes emanate from the roast, along with a hint of espresso. Plenty of boozy notes, along with a lighter tropical hint. The cask engine has left this one extremely smooth and creamy. Finish is so silky, and the booze barely registers in the taste. Outstanding beer.","BretSikkink","Jun 17, 2010"

4.75,14.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I am sommelier and have worked with fine wines for 10 years. I never could quite appreciate beer until after I developed my palate with wine. From my wine knowledge came my love of craft beer and intelligence to recognize the flavor profiles that are omnipresent in beer, translating to bliss on my palate. This beer to me was like sipping a '65 Margaux, only cheaper and more fun to evaluate. The bottle/label itself screams drink me and when you start to pour it you are overwhelmed with a rich, bourbon-chocolate aroma. The aroma also included a sweet cream of coconut and butter. I poured mine into a lightly chilled snifter because I wanted to evaluate the beer at different temps, and as the beer warmed the better it got. The appearance is rich chocolate brown with a steady lacing and thick toffee head. The flavor is impressive, but a little hot at first. The vanilla tones really help balance the beer on the palate, while the roasted citrus, oak, chocolate, plum, and coffee complete the journey around the tongue. Very rich and creamy, almost enough so serve over ice cream. For being as dark as it is I was expecting more body but was incredibly satisfied with its medium body and velvety smoothness that lingered delightfully for a while. Very rounded, full, and balanced beer, truly remarkable. I decided to pair this beer with a dry-aged prime rib eye, which turned out to be the right choice as the rich fatty meat complimented the deep flavors of the beer and the aged authentic balsamic I used brought out the sweetness of the brew. I highly recommend this beer and am now spoiled by yet another fantastic Allagash creation.","SteelerChris","May 12, 2010"

3.75,-9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Served in a .25cl Allagash tulip. Poured the color of cola with a mere swirl of foam comprising the head, and a tight band around the perimeter of the glass. Nose is very subdued; some brewer's licorice - nose seems closer to a baltic porter. Taste reveals a little bourbon, a hint of a medicinal quality and black licorice; there's also a slightly vinous quality (once again reminiscent of a baltic porter). Mouthfeel was light/medium with a fairly subdued background effervescence. Happy to try this, but I'm a bigger fan of the standard Black. Certainly worth a try if you have the opportunity, but not the best example of barrel-aging from this brewer.","Jwale73","Mar 25, 2009"

The nose has dark roasty malts, peppery Belgian yeasts, chocolate and whiskey. The barrel aging for sure added another layer of complexity to the nose, but I'm not sure it had much of an affect on the flavor profile. The taste is however a bit more rounded. Not quite as roasty as the regular Black. The body is not as full as I expected, but still drinks well.","rye726","0"
