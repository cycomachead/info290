Scents of Belgian yeast, some wild, sour aromas, faint candi sugar, overripe fruit, grape, plum, slight cocoa, dark chocolate and some brown sugar. A very nice, complex aroma, true to form for an Abbey strong dark, very well executed. Taste begins with dark fruit, prune and raisin with some sour funk in the background. White grape appears in the middle, along with spicy yeast and sweet spices. Towards the end of the sip better sweet chocolate and bready malt come forward. A good amount of alcohol is present in the flavor. A sweet brew, with the usual Belgian spiciness. Very well done, quite complex and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with medium low carbonation and a semi-drying, chalky mouthfeel. Very good, very much a Belgian. Overall this is a good Belgian Strong Dark. All the usual flavors and aromas are on display, the complexity is present and its a very good beer.

Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, molasses, dark bread, honey, herbal, light clove, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness.

Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish.

The flavor it a bit more typical, but I think this beer is trying to do its own thing. I've got lots of cherry and bit of fig, but that dark earth also really comes through due to the dryness of this brew. It's quite a bit different than its Trappist brethren, but that is quite alright. It also is a little untamed, as in hot.

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, dark fruit, and some earthy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with toasted bread and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it's much more earthy and slightly rough compared to how I thought it would be.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 18, 2013"

The aroma is a mix of medicinal yeast and toasty malt notes. Little bit of nail polish remover and wood. The malt has some nice things going on - toffee, dates, plums, caramel, bread and molasses - but it's still kinda simple. There's just too much sweetness mixing with those medicinal Belgian esters, and it doesn't really work. The taste is quite sweet. Somewhat cloying. Oddly vinous and still fairly toasty. It's kind of a mess. Fair bit of booze. Fairly heavy feel. Coats the mouth more than I'd like, but that might be more a flavor issue than feel. Carbonation is normal. This was a disappointment. I was pretty excited to find this beer and try a new Trappist brewery, but it's just not very good.","popery","Mar 03, 2013"

4.25,10.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured into a snifter glass. Pours dark brown to black with a two-finger length of light tan head. The beer appears to be well carbonated and the head dissipates at a moderate pace. The aroma is fruit forward, smelling a little like cherries and bananas. There are dark roasted malts and caramel. The flavor is much like the nose, which is fruit and malt forward. I get those cherry and banana notes from the yeast as well as dark fruit notes and some mild caramel with the roasted malts. The body is medium to full with strong carbonation. The finish is a little dry and there isn't much of an aftertaste. It's fairly easy drinking despite the high alcohol content. This is an excellent beer, but just so. I would recommend trying this beer if you're a completist for the Trappist breweries or you just like this style.","acevenom","Beers"

The taste brings in more of the same, though unfortunately accompanied by some musty apple/white wine grape character throughout. This flavor just ruins everything, literally leaving a bad taste in my mouth. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, it seemed as though the Local Option crew agreed with me that this beer, though well-looked-forward-to, really fell flat on its face, especially with that weird flavor in there (which is exacerbated by the alcohol level). Without any hesitation, this is the worst Trappist beer I've ever had.
