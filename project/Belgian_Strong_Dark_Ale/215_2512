Cloudy brown in color, appearing downright murky. Aroma of red wine, fresh baked bread,  dates, and a very subtle spice note. This beer definitely was aiming for more of the dark fruit notes found in quads v.s the spicy phenolic notes. On the palate the maltiness comes through more but the dark fruit hangs around too. Bready and rich on the palate. Finish is of dark caramelized fruits. Alcohol doesn't even exist in this beer. It leans on the sweet side but still maintains a nice balance. Carbonation wipes the palate clean and keeps the drinker coming back sip after sip. Maybe not enough spice IMO but none the less a great offering, easily available and  a real nice sipper.","Haydn-Juby","Nov 23, 2014"

T- it Is what you'd want out of a Belgian Trappist beer on steroids. All the hints of dates, carmel, and also has a nice spice. Overall this beer is a top five beer in my opinion. Good alcohol content and good on any occasion but preferably cold weather. I like to eat a steak and Caesar salad while drinking it. Price is the only negative","Nico4","Nov 17, 2014"

It's been a real favorite of mine since our first encounter, and one I'll grab on a few more than special occasions every year. Just a classy ale from a classy brewery. Chimay offering are all world class, but the blue is their way of showing you how talented and perfected a beer recipe can be.","BradtheGreat7","Oct 20, 2014"

The color when poured is a deep amber / burgundy with a thick tan head fizzing on top. Tasting this beer makes me feel like I am by a fireplace on a cold winter night. Its warming and has bold notes of spice and oak chips, figs and vanilla, all wrapped up with a slight dark chocolate finish. All with smooth medium body.

4.97,15.6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Words do not do this beer justice, as this is quite easily the tastiest beer ever created. The label looks somewhat nondescript, much like other Trappist beers, but it hides the one of the most complex tastes of any beer I've ever had the pleasure to drink. It's, sweet, fruity, and also slightly peppery, with the faintest hint of bitterness; it's heavily spiced and smells strongly of cloves. I had one of the larger 750 ml bottles, and with its 9% ABV, it certainly hit the spot. This pairs superbly with a juicy, medium-rare steak.","TheBeerLord","Jul 07, 2014"

4.41,2.6,,,,,,"Poured into goblet from 0.75L bottle.  Appears very dark brown with a tinge of auburn when held up to a light.  No real head to speak of, but little carbonation bubbles are pretty consistent.  Nose is sweet.  Raisin, red wine, and preserved plum are scents that I am reminded of.  Bready yeast is also in there.  Taste is not as sweet as the nose in my opinion.  Malt even comes through with some roasty, coffee like bitterness in the midst of the toffee sweetness and bready and yeasty flavors.  Mouthfeel is perfect with a nice amount of carbonation and a long lasting almost syrupy finish.  I love this beer.  This beer really helped to get me into the craft thing years ago and I know I can always go to it for a great drink and some memories.","slackattack","Jun 26, 2014"

OCCASION: saluting the Spurs for knocking off LeBron--and celebrating father's Day as well...APPEARANCE: ark chocolate purple body; one finger pale off-white head--creamy... AROMA: immediate floral yeasts pitch thee malts favorably; a wine/red grape insinuation--promising... PALATE: smooth, velvety dry as a pinot noir; soft aftertaste; warming but not overt--a body that is more than sippable, and one that demands immediate revisiting... TASTE: big yet palatable flavor, reminiscent of grape and dry wine tannins; malts are subdued, slightly toasted; well balanced... OVERALLL: a great nightcap to a great Father's Day; 9% ABV never felt so good....","dacrza1","Jun 22, 2014"

Mouthfeel is a touch light, but still smooth and complements the flavors well. To me, this doesn't come close to being as complex as a Westy 12 or Rochefort.

I imagine this would go great with a stank-ass cheese (preferably from Chimay themselves), and this is certainly worth having again to find out. Still, my favorite (non-quad) BSDA remains Gouden Carolus Classic.","ThisWangsChung","Jan 16, 2014"

The bouquet is a bit off and the taste is somewhat one-dimensional, but -nonetheless-- this is an excellent brew. So, my advice is to save up your sheckles and buy a bottle of this to try. Then once you have done so, save up some more money (less than Chimay, BTW) and buy a bottle of St. Feuillien Speciale instead. Or, go to your local Trader Joe's and buy 750ML of a comparable beer for $5.","BeerDocT","Jan 14, 2014"

The forth settles down a bit but the carbonation remains brisk. Although one's Belgian dark ale schema is screaming heavy and thick, this classic is in fact silky smooth, creamy, and of only moderate body, although the flavors are assertive enough. Aroma of cooked orchard fruit (pears and apples), raisins, dates, sweet grains, and a decent dose of cellar must. Boozy and a bit funky in the yeast sense. Although the aroma is not terribly spicy (maybe its my crap sense of smell), the palate is spice-forward ... Pepper and pumpkin pie spice, cloves, and a rather unique and very pleasing floral/herbal essence like dried basil and sandalwood. Malts remind one of rye bread and hints of toasted crust. Sweet rum, dates, treacle, a whiff of chocolate ... A fresher fruitiness as well in this example, almost like Concord grapes. Intermittent blasts of alcohol. The king of Chimay. Perhaps lighter and drier than other Belgian darks but has its own herbal/floral character paired with the yeast, spice, and dark fruit one would expect. A standby in my beer fridge and shockingly drinkable for such a heavy hitter.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 25, 2013"

Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big pear, apple, raisin, plum, pepper, clove, banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light/dark fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great crisp malt/fruity/spicy flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian dark ale. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Excellent, true to form for a good Trappist ale. Scents of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, dark fruit, molasses, raisins, prunes, a slight metallic twinge, peppery, spicy scents, grape, slight apple, banana comes forward as it warms, melding with the other aromas to make a nice, sweet scent. Very faint hints of alcohol in the background. A rich, sweet, deep aroma with an amazing complexity, as expected of a Trappist ale. Flavor follows the nose. It is quite sweet up front notes of apple, raisin, dark fruit, and slight pear. As it warms in the mouth sweet caramel malt, honey, and spicy flavors begin to emerge, melding with the fruit. As you swish spicy clove and alcohol notes emerge in the back of the mouth. Candi sugar and Belgian yeast spiciness and hints of faint herbal qualities and wood in the background are present throughout. Finish is spicy and burns the nose slightly, with alcohol, clove, yeasty spice, and some non-descript sweet spices. All the flavors meld wonderfully throughout the sip and lead to a rich, complex, satisfying flavor, warming and perfect for cold weather. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, slightly sticky, moderately carbonated and with a semi-drying finish in the mouth. Quite nice. A very good sipping beer. Quite pleasant, with maybe just a touch too much carbonation for me. Overall this an excellent Trappist ale. It is a fine Belgian Strong Dark, with all the depth, complexity and nuance of the style. It is a fine beer to sip on a cold night, strong, with a great depth of scent and flavor. Truly excellent.","Auraan","Nov 09, 2013"

Working together with the booze, it creates a bright burn that's mirrored in the gut as the 9% begins to collect. The tannic dryness of a wine offsets sweetness well and makes me reach for the glass again. Wait long enough between gulps, and buccal surfaces feel almost metal-polished--a reminder that there are hops doing their part. All these moving parts keep this fat, creamy monk from smothering you--he's jolly and round, but never too heavy. A true classic religious experience.","1sophrosyne1","Jun 29, 2013"

It is dark amber with a generous head. It is bouncing with flavour and is very, very smooth. There is a very slight bitter aftertaste. However, it is 9% ABV so I don't think I would have more than two or three bottles in one sitting as there is a definite kick off it. By the way, I don't have a Chimay Chalice glass so I used a pretty similar looking very large red wine glass instead!","skyway99","Jun 24, 2013"

Aromas of richly sweet date and grapes, giving it a wine-like characteristic. Some subtle spicing of nutmeg and all-spice, with a tone of alcohol throughout, as well. Smells balanced and rich. Flavors are very rich, with heavy old-world fruit sweetness giving a rich and robust blast to the palate. Nutmeg and clove clean up the tail end of the palate, and there is a tangy toffee sweetness that carries through into the aftertaste. The carbonation keeps the beer light and crisp despite full flavors and a full body. Clean, smooth finish, with a tangy sweet and slightly boozy linger. Very solid, very balanced, and very tasty.","GarthDanielson","May 12, 2013"

Nice plop from the cork, a strong indication of the carbonation level to come. Nice fizz with a thick head that dissipates very quickly. Very dark amber color, hints of ruby red. when held up to the light. Mouth feel is a little excessive from the carbonation. It could mellow a bit with more cellar time, like several months: I bought this one only two weeks ago and have been itching to try it.. Not real sure about this at first, wasn't at all what I expected. Starting to like it more and more with each sip. Noticing sherry, caramel, VERY mild hops, dark Belgian candy sugar. Nicely blended, well-crafted, a very good desert beer with chocolate. Alcohol content is hidden well, but still present. The only "knock" for lack of a better term would be very mild smell, and the slight over-carbonation of this particular bottle at this time. Smell would take away from the complexity of the blend. I really can see it mellowing with age and moving up a couple of notches. As the glass sits for a couple of minutes and the carbonation dissipates, the true nature of this beer comes out, especially the sherry, caramel roasted malt and the complexity of the blend..","Curtis","May 10, 2013"

A little perfume and spice are also present. The taste displays the malt profile appropriately, which is harmonized with the alcohol here. The body is medium and well-carbonated, and the hops are very discreet. The end is dry, and the aftertaste appears as a crescendo, with sharp bitterness.","HabiMendes","Apr 05, 2013"

It is still a very good beer that i will be buying again and again as i'm a huge fan of trappist beer, but i really thought the red was more balanced. Which is weird because I usually like the higher abv beers more. If you've had other trappist beers, this one is probably the most unique out of the 6 trappidt breweries i've tried. Not the best, but a great beer worthy of trying, if they are sold out of Chimay Red...","Roman5150","Apr 04, 2013"

I am impressed also at its drinkability with such a high ABV. This is definitely worth a try.","tdm168","Jan 25, 2013"

Most of it fades away, but a solid iceberg like chunk remains long after. Lacing is pretty sparse. The nose is almost perfection. Lots of plum and fig, and spicy phenols are a secondary aroma. The flavor profile still has some dark fruit esters, and they're joined by a light caramel touch. The pepper and clove spicy notes are definitely more pronounced than in the nose, and just a hair too much so for my taste. The mouthfeel is fantastic, highlighted by a very well dried out body. The carbonation is plenty lively, but there's just a slight lack of creaminess to it. Chimay Grand Reserve is an absolute classic in the craft beer scene, and with good reason.","axeman9182","Dec 31, 2012"

The flavor is rich and sweet with a full complement of dark dried fruits as well as some complex dark sugary flavors. Slight vinous quality as well as some bready yeasty flavors round this one out quite nicely. Medium to thick body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy burnt sugary mouthfeel.

The only reason I bought it was because I found a Chimay goblet for $3 and figured I might as well break it in with a bottle of Blue. I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these a night, but I wouldn't really want to. It's complex, sophisticated, and perfectly balanced. Worth a try even if you don't like Belgians.","dmatsui","Oct 07, 2012"

Upping the score on this beer as I can now really appreciate it (refined palate). Taste had a bunch more ripe fruit flavors with plum, grape, cherry, apple and a bit more caramel malt (probably due to the age). Not as sweet as stated in my initial review. Great beer, I had no problem downing a 750 over an evening. Still a sipper, but a fine one at that.","Kadonny","Sep 12, 2012"

3.91,-9.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a Chimay chalice. The color is a dark brown the color of an oak barrel with a swirling of cherry red throughout. The head was fizzy, off-white to khaki and seemed to retreat back into the beer without much left in its wake. The nose didn't quite have that usual strong Belgian yeast I expect in a Belgian strong. It was there, just muted. There are also hints of plums and dates with a lot of fizz. The taste again has a very muted Belgian yeast character. There is sweet dates and cherries, but it finishes farily dry, preventing it from becoming overly cloying. Mouthfeel is heavy on carbonation; alcohol is masked well. I have always passed by this beer because I felt it was probably priced higher than it was worth, and I am just not finding a taste for Belgians. It's a good Belgian Strong, but it's not great.","estlinska","Jul 07, 2012"

4.13,-4,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Pours a deep molasses brown with a big white caramelized head that trembles down quickly and a thin lattice work of droopy lacing on the sides. This beer looks pretty in the glass, even with the chunks floating around in it. The smell is like a caramelized biscuit, sweet and malty with some good yeasty notes and light hints of fruits, molasses, brown sugars, candy sugars, and even a little citrusy tinge at the very end. It has a rich sweet taste like caramel and molasses. There is also a lingering flavor of dark fruit and, again, an ever so slight hint of citrus at the back of the taste along with a boozy back taste that can be quite strong. The taste is a little too sweet for my palate, reminiscent of sweet dark candies. It is oozing and thick in the mouth, however, which gives it a very nice feel. It is also a little cloying in the after effects on the mouth, leaving a thick wet trail of saliva on the tongue. Carbonation is nearly negligible in the taste. This is a nice dark Belgian with a lot of nice complex flavors in it. The sweet strikes a little too high in the initial gulp and lingers almost like a tingle in the edges of the mouth, but the mouthfeel is great, and the candied hints are virulently present in the taste. Overall it is a tasty dark Belgian ale, and a great example of the style. It’s rather heavy on the belly, and sweet for my tastes, but a decent beer overall.","Maxwell","Jun 29, 2012"

Along with everything that is good about Belgian ale, Chimay has managed to stuff all the ambience of a Belgian bar into a bottle, and all at export prices. Nothing is out of balance here: the aroma is bready and heady but not overly yeasty, and the taste is so smooth and fruity and doesn't suffer from hard-edged hoppiness or overheated alcohol. This is something to enjoy at any time of the year, but especially on a colder-than-it-should-be May evening in New England. You cannot lose with any bottle from Chimay.","gfreed","Jun 05, 2012"

4.92,14.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark caramel brown with an abundant tan head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation appears to be abundant. The sediment helped cloud the beer to make it opaque. There are aromas of dark fruits, malt, brown sugar, and yeast. There are tastes of bready dark malt, dark fruits like prunes and raisins, yeast, and brown sugar. The alcohol is present in the flavor as is some hop bitterness. It's very well balanced. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is quite lively. It's very easy to drink for such a strong beer. Overall, this is another excellent beer from the abbey. This is a top notch example of the style. It's easily acquirable in most stores, so Chimay provides a great entry for people wanting to try Trappist beer.","acevenom","Apr 28, 2012"

And while standing inline one day at wal-mart a gentleman with a handlebar mustache asked me if I had ever tried Chimay before. He said if I liked dark beers the Guinness that I would really like the Chimay so I went on a quest to find some no one close carried it so I wound up in Evansville one night with my brother-in-law and we steped into a liquor store and they had a sampler pack of all 3 of the Chimays and a glass. I purchased the pack and the quest was started. I liked all 3 of the Chimays but the Grande Reserve Blue is my favorite.","Mrjwsjr","Apr 23, 2012"

Dark, ripe fruit aroma with clove, a hint of banana, and an underlying sweet maltiness. Rich, aggressive carbonation with a rather dry finish. Delicate combination of dark fruit and spicy flavors throughout with hints of banana that occasionally show through. A very light dark roasted malted backbone fights through the carbonation. A touch of bitter hop flavor is introduced at the finish with a bit of booziness too.","IronLover","Feb 11, 2012"

It was a beautifully dark brew that intimidated me at first as I had not had much experience with Belgian strong dark ales. However, once I poured it into that goblet of mine, ohhh... the magic. Easily ranks as one of the best beers i've ever had, and probably ever will have. Very strong aroma of berries and cloves. Amazing warming sensation in the cheeks and the throat. Beautiful dark head to match the hue of the brew. If you are looking for cost-performance in a beer, this is the one. Treat yourself to it! I'm a Chimay believer for life!","shigg85","Feb 09, 2012"

I am new to Chimay so I picked up a bottle based on the advice from the knowledgeable beer salesman who said this is his favorite. Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip. The beer pours a deep mahogany color with huge 3 finger tan colored head. Excellent retention and lacing. Bits of yeast sediment settle slowly. The aroma is nice, belgian yeast with it's characteristic clove aroma thought subtle is detectable. Thick malts, almost syrup like character. The taste is incredibly smooth: mild sweetness with mild bitterness, fig/plum fruitiness, thick caramel, hints of pepper. Very rich. Well crafted. I am amazed at how these Trappist brews hide their high alcohol so well. I could drink this all day long. Higher end of medium bodied and well carbonated. Very pleased with this beer. Highly recommended.","hopfacebrew","Jan 30, 2012"

Furthermore, the balance was lacking: the molasses sweetness completed overpowered the more subtle and delicate flavors: the esters, the phenols, the alcohols. And while I said that the finish was dry, it was hard to assess. The finish was big and almost cloying. The afterbirth was nice, whiskey-like as I said, but it took a long time to get there. This beer has the subtle flavors that are characteristic of this style, but the balance was not there. It took a deep patience to get to the subtle and complex symphony of flavors because of the misplaced child banging the cymbal of sweetness.","kevinjosephlee","Dec 17, 2011"

4.65,8.1,4,4,5,4.5,5,"When I first tried Chimay Blue it was like nothing I've ever tasted. It has a special "homemade" flavour that I have come to associate with true trappist beers. The flavours are subtle; earthy yeast and roasted malts with gentle hops. Fresh from the bottle it has a lot of sweetness, and I get the impression that it is designed to be aged before it is enjoyed. For a stout packing 9% ABV it is very smooth drinking, and definitely one of my favourite beers.","Raebies","Nov 22, 2011"

4.65,8.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"UPDATE: Tried a 1.3 year old 330ml bottle earlier, and while I don't think the other two by Chimay are superior when aged, this is completely true for Chimay bleue. The aromas resemble a thick raspberry-strawberry drink like nothing else, and the drinking experience is far maltier and yeastier, yet extremely smooth to the point of extreme relaxation. Highly recommended aging 750ml bottles of this for a year or two - you won't regret it.","magictacosinus","Sep 19, 2011"

4.37,1.6,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"A world class beer, although it's the most expensive beer I've ever reviewed given it's exceptionally high cost per unit alcohol volume. The cost is so high that it's almost prohibitive to drink considering the competition. Like most Belgian Strong Dark Ales, it's very malty and pours a muddy burgundy-brown with a thick creamy head. It smells great - like candy sugar, raisin, plums and spice. Up to this point it's about perfect, but on the first sip things start to go downhill a bit. The complex blend of flavor is somewhat disjointed, and the lack of carbonation makes it feel somewhat watery. Unlike a rich malty doppelbock, this doesn't feel much like a meal in a glass, but more like a seasonal cider. It's definitely sweet, spicy and delicious, but in my opinion there are better beers given the prohibitive cost. Try St. Bernardus Abt 12, The Sixth Glass or Aventinus Eisbock to get more flavor and spend less duckets.","BryanRex","Sep 18, 2011"

4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This pours a yeast fill hazy dark tea brownish color with a large tan head which foams up but then quickly dissipates down to a thin layer. The smell is of yeast esters, slightly sweet, some fruit (grapes). Feel is medium and with high carbonation. The taste is pretty sweet, lots of fruit and sugars, this is a very sweet beer, but its also very good (but I've had it many times and know what to expect).

The head fades fairly quickly and leaves no lacing. Dark fruit scents - plum, fig, raisin, and grape - are pleasing to the nose, but a bit on the weak side. A dark fruit sweetness carries through in the taste, along with a bit of nuttiness and molasses, but it's not overly sweet. Alcohol taste is barely noticeable.

4.52,5.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I was going to bow and scrape before this beer, loudly proclaiming "I'm not worthy!" until I popped the cap and it began to foam up through the neck. This is MUCH too precious a beer to allow to go to waste and so I sprang into action, decanting it into my Westmalle glass so that I could stop the foaming. I created a dense finger of light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights, but it was too dark in its color to be able to gauge clarity. I could still see the lees in the bottom of the bottle, so I would guess that I did okay. The nose on this beer is worth the price of admission! I have stated many times over that I am a self-avowed hophead and do not generally like malty beers, but this is an exception. The initial waft is of dried dark fruits, followed by a healthy smack of alcohol heat and then chocolate and nuts. I could sit with my nose buried in the glass for a while, but a) you get the idea, b) there are plenty of other, better reviews and c) I am anxious for a sip. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with an initial sugary/malty sweetness and some big heat, followed by caramel and toffee, then dried dark fruit and finally a touch of yeasty must. Finish brought the heat then settled back for a slightly dry aftertaste. Right after that, the mellow began to set in and I felt sleepy, very sleepy.

4.8,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Wow. This is one hell of a beer. Reviewed freshly bought from Monoprix, un-aged. An aggressive pour yield plentiful head, which dissipates rather quickly. Dark brown body that allows some light through. The nose gives hints of caramel and slight smokiness. Of course on the flavor, said notes of caramel and smokiness come through, in addition to a slight nutty flavour. Mouth feel is lively, complete but not overly heavy. Overall, the complete package sets this beer apart from others. Truly unique and world class Trappist product. Surely it gets knocked for its popularity and availability compared to some of the other Trappist products, but the beer really speaks for its own cause. Highly recommended.","dsprainman","Aug 13, 2011"

I guess he figured that a 22 year old wouldn't have tried that beer yet. Needless to say, I had and it was very good. The beer poured out as bubbly brown color with some red highlights. The smell of the beer is a bit on the earthy side with some sweet dark fruits on the nose and of course a hefty amount of yeast. The taste is a little metallic at first but that fades as it warms up. The dark fruits are subtle here but there is a slight sweetness from them, it's a little boozy, and has some spice in the back end too. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little thin but had enough carbonation to keep this one interesting. Overall this is enjoyable, I like to order it on occasion but not often.","Knapp85","Jul 26, 2011"

Poured a massive ecru colored head which settled to lacing and traces. Color is a deep russet, almost cider-like. Smell has malt, raisins, figs, or basically dark dried fruits. Taste has more of the same and it's quite rich. There's an acidic zing which persists in one of the longest lasting finishes I've ever had in a beer. Clearly this deserves the world class status it holds. Of course I'd prefer if it were cheaper. And what I don't get from it, which I've seen other reviewers claim, is plum, pear, honey, or bubblegum. Say what?","MoreThanWine","May 28, 2011"

Nice white head, which (mostly) lasts 'till the last sip and a dark, cloudy brown color, if put towards the light, a little reddish. Smell is nice, but not very strong... some sweetness, a little bit of yeast and dry fruit, maybe... Taste? Awesome. I think this beer masks the alcohol really well, as I can't taste it much, a little bit of bitternes at the end, very smooth. Quite a lot of carbonations at the start, warming feel at the end. A decent slow-sipping beer that's perfect for special occasions or, for the lovers of the type, even everyday beer. I strongly recommend it! Cheers.","Joplisan","Apr 28, 2011"

I don't mind the alcohol at all, in fact, I think it adds to the overall taste of this beer. Drinkability is great. 9% ABV isn't overwhelming, and this beer goes down pretty easily.

It tasted slightly bitter-sweet in the beginning with a hint of raisons and finished moderately sweet and malty and had a slight alcohol tinge at the end with the flavor only lasting a short time.

Yeasty and good. A bit sweet, almost brandy-like. Smells as good as it tastes. A hint of clove to the smell. Good, but I am thinking it would be great with some more age on it.

I also enjoyed both the Chimay Red and White which came in the same tasting pack. I just don't know what's wrong with the Chimay Blue now, it's supposed to be their flagship beer but I can quite honestly say it's just a bad beer at present. Carbonation dies down too quickly (I'm staring at the glass within 10 minutes of opening the bottle and there is 0 head left, a far cry from the Bernardus Abt where the head lasted for 50 minutes or so), flavour is muted. Maybe there's been some problems in bottling but they've occurred repeatedly and I've no problems marking down this most overrated of beers. 2.5","danieelol","Jan 13, 2011"

The malt smell is so delicious, the scent is making my mouth water just smelling it. The color of the beer is a little darker than I expected for a Belgium, however it is a strong dark ale, so it should have been expected. The beer is a little cloudy, but again, should be expected as it is bottle conditioned and non-filtered. The head retention is amazing, 3-4 minutes after pour I still have at least three centimeters. Tasting the beer I was a bit surprised. It was a lot crisper, cleaner, than I expected. It is very well balanced, to say the least, starts with a sweet/fruity twang than the malts mellow out to the end. I didn't really taste the alcohol until the finish, but it is present. The beer also has a warming effect on the finish, with a medium body. The carbonation in the mouth was around par, not overly abundant but still very noticeable. The creaminess of the beer, mixed with the carbonation, mixed with the body and warmth of the alcohol was really a nice combination.","DaveCS","Dec 30, 2010"

4.43,3,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Pours a unique murky, dark reddish brown color with a bunch of yeast sediment that floats around aimlessly within my Chimay chalice glass. A thick and creamy looking 1/4 inch head forms which recedes to some tiny clumps that seem to linger around on the top of the beer. Smells of Iraqi figs picked fresh off the tree, along with distinct characteristics of dark sun-maid rasins and a strong presence of alcohol. The taste is of sweet, bold malts with definite caramel notes that are followed by a strong alcohol presence. As this brew warms up in the glass, more fruity, alcohol soaked flavors such as the distinct figs and raisins that were noticeable in the aroma become available to the tastebuds. The mouthfeel fits into the med/heavy range and is paired with a high level of carbonation that somehow blends nicely with the beer's characteristics. Definitely a beer to share with a friend, it is bold, smooth, and highly enjoyable.","jsdunlop","Dec 29, 2010"

Kinda reminded me of this alcohol-laced fruitcake my parents used to get every year (which I loved, btw). The flavors were just as rich and complex as one would hope for in the style. I tasted things as varied as tobacco ,gingerbread cookies, plums and cherries, chocolate, caramel, savory yeast and currants. Impressive. The booze was not very well masked which might be a turn-off to some but I kinda demand it in a Belgian Strong Ale The body was full, the mouthfeel velvety and the carbonation delicate.

I poured the 0.33L bottle into a non-sanctioned chalice and was befuddled by the amount of creamy head that I was presented with. It started with about 3 fingers of head and within a minute I was left with about one finger. The smell is malty, almost caramel, but fairly intense. The flavour was very good and had tones of caramel and fruits and could taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel was warm from the alcohol-not too terribly syrupy for the darkness - and it lingered for a second gently nudging my taste buds until they resonded. It is very drinkable but due to the price (approx $3.00 US) and the alcohol content I would not consider it a session beer. Still, I will try it again-just not tonight.","jhtipton","Sep 25, 2010"

The head recedes quickly as expected and true ton the style. Aromas of caramelized sugars, Pete moss, some rich bready, raisins and some rum even come through. Sweet smelling with a slight booze kick. The taste has rich caramelized sugars, sweet raisin bagel breadiness. Alcohol esters come through but are contained with rich malts that are comforting and very smooth. Carbonated to the max, this cuts through my steak easily. Really pairs well but I bet this would be heaven with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Drinkability is perfect.

I appreciate the balance and the dryness, as well as all the great yeasty notes, but there are a few things missing here that could improve this beer, and I would have hoped and assumed Chimay would have done those things by now (maybe my tastes are just funky).

I do think the mouthfeel is a bit different for the style; on the thin side of moderate with a thin fizzy feel. A very enjoyable strong dark.

The color is a deep mahogany brown that strikes an appetizing chord. The malt aroma is strong and sweet. The fruitiness of the yeast connects with deep plum scents, along with a very small snippet of cherry, and there is just a hint of spice to tickle the nose. There is a sweet, lightly malty ride upfront with spice and lots of fruity flavors. I get cherry and plum, with sugary swirls thrown into the mix. There is a touch of roasted malt, but your palate does need to search it out. The alcohol comes across quite pleasently and there is a semi dry finish to it.

4.58,6.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"My last impression of Chimay Blue before I stopped drinking it was "Annoying, way too fruity, overcarbonated mess." I guess I have changed a bit since then, because Chimay Blue is world class. I think the carbonation, dryness, and deep dark flavors were probably a bit too much for me when I first started getting into beer. Whether I've changed or misremembered or whatever, I love it now. It's one of those all too few beers that gives you some crazy, novel combination of flavors in every sip, each one interesting, palate-pleasing, and satisfying--with real *character* in all 4 of the objective BA rating categories. It's probably time to put Chimay back into regular rotation for me.","Pahn","Mar 27, 2010"
4.2,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours dark slightly orange brown with a nice ecru head, not much lacing. The smell is spicy and full of currant and dried black sweet cherry aroma. It also has a sort of savory note that I am having a hard time placing. Taste is very similar to aroma with tons of dried dark fruit, some brandy character and herbal hop bitterness. This is definitely more sweet than bitter, but there is definitely a decent amount of dryness. The spice from the yeast is much less noticeable in the flavor. This beer seems to mask its alcohol content better than others of the style, though it is present. Mouthfeel is medium, but is lighter than I expected. Somewhat spikey carbonation kind of takes away from the mouthfeel, but the finish is quite nice. Drinkablilty is good for this style. A classic example of the style, and a solid Trappist style ale.","zoso1967","Mar 26, 2010"

Over time, it offers in its smells and tastes a texture close to the port (Maderisation) while keeping its keys spice.

The flavor revealed all of the above in copious amounts, however the alcohol wasn't very well masked, and the after-burn was a little too much.

I can't explain how, but the balance is slightly off, perhaps because this bottle is still too young?

Pours a brilliant crimson red & cloudy with a massive suede head. Its beautiful to look at against the sunlight. Showed a lot of life, surprisingly for a big beer. Okay, the smell was dark and fruity all the way. A lot of damson and caramel, and reminded me of a walnut pudding. The head retained all the while so I had my first sip of Chimay thru it - massive to say the least. Dark fruits, mainly plums and caramel are in your face. A little tart feel remains prominent in between sips. Mouthfeel is solid and heavy with medium carbonation. I would keep it down to 1 bottle a go for the ABV, which by the way it hides very well. Very easy to go astray with this one I would say.","BeerSingh","Sep 14, 2009"

Head retention is outstanding eventually receding to creamy foam that leaves nice sticky lacing on the glass. Nose is of dark fruits - cherries, raisins, dates, and distinct but not overpowering alcohol presence. Taste is of the dark fruits - cherries and raisins with some molasses in the body, there is a touch of spice as well in here, alcohol is also easily present. As the beer warms, fruit flavoring becomes more pronounced and I pick a bit of plum and apple in the taste. Medium body with moderate to high carbonation, light and airy feel on the tongue.

The taste starts of with the slightly sweet, dark fruity flavor that was present in the nose and transitions to a slightly bitter, dry, warming alcohol finish. Raisins and figs, slightly spicy. Complex yet simple and difficult to discribe. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin, whispy carbonation.

This is a complex and delicate brew with at least 2 different yeasts in the brewing process both top and bottom fermenting. This attention to detail creats a complexity and a character that rivals any malt beverage brewed anywhere at any price. The flavor notes vary from coffee, chocolate, cherry, vanilla, toffee and lemon. This wide of a flavor palate rivals a fine Bordeax wine in complexity but at less than half the price on average provides far better value for the money. The appearance, smell taste and mouthfeel are all off the charts superb. Note, cellaring this beer for more than one year can allow for some moderate level metallic notes.

The flavor is much more appealing. Chocolate, rum raisin, caramelized sugars. Very nice. The high alcohol of Chimay Blue do not cause this beer to come off as thing.

3.28,-23.7,4,3.5,3,4,3,"From a 33cl botle in Lund. A beautiful dark opaque chestnut color with a big and wild off-white head that leaves a delecate layer of foam after a few minutes. The Aroma is of brown sugar and spiced apple, with a hint of bitter orange peel topping it off. The flavor is sweet with lots of maltiness and some citrus, but the finish imparts some bitterness with the high ABV showing up to close it off. The mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, with good carbonation. This is a good beer, maybe great, but I might like Chimay Red better because of its great balance of flavors. Blue is definitely a complex and intense beer. I'm looking forward to trying another (8 4 8 4 16) - - - rerate: 750ml bottle, served in a Chimay glass. This time around, I didn't pick up nearly as much of the flavor that I remember from before. There was less sweetness and more yeastiness, and thats about it. I really wasn't impressed. It's possible that this was a consequence from coming across the pond this time, but a brew like this should stand up to that. Disappointing. Next up.

Lots of caramel and candy apples in the taste. Also got hints of fruit cake and rum? Carbonation reminds me of champagne. Wow what a great brew. It gets better as it warms I have had this beer many times and have found different flavors each time. I always have a bottle of this and the Chimay white in my fridge.

The bottle is of an unconventional shape. The smell is almost a sour aroma and smells of strong yeast. This beer has a delightful full bodied taste. You can really taste the barley, malt, and yeast with tones of carmel and is a fairly sweet beer. It has a somewhat tangy aftertaste. I drank this beer quite cold and it was very refreshing going down my throat. Smooth yet tingly at the same time. A fine quality beer, drinkable to say the least.

The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Just a light amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is a little weak but I do detect fruity esters. Not dark fruit which I was expecting but more in line with plums, grapes, and banana. The flavor is full of fruit and sugar. Dark fruit this time such as dates and figs. Sweet and floral with just a hint of alcohol. The body is surprisingly light and effervescent. One of the great beers of the world.","morimech","Mar 22, 2009"

Murky muddy brown in color, more yellow tinges than orange or red, lots of floating particulate even with a careful pour. The nose leans a good deal on cinnamon, clove like spice and brown sugar for oomph, lesser degree on raisin bread, dry chocolate powder, dried apricots and peaches, figs too, light banana esters, not as forceful as expected, you have to work at drawing out the scents even though the glass has "Chimay" written on it. Full-bodied and a touch heavy on the palate, here the flavors deliver more depth. And while no heat, you can feel the alcoholic content. Clove, allspice, cinnamon spice and orange peel comes at you first, notes of cola and brown bread as well. The carbonation is very aggressive, although not able to cleanse, more so add to the turbulence. Chocolate powder, yeast, raisin, fig, apricot, peach and banana fruit fit into the groove. Dry finish given its body and initial sweetness. Can't say I could drink more a couple in a sitting.","farrago","Mar 16, 2009"

More medium than full-bodied, but extremely smooth and creamy, with sweet malts like caramel seem to be predominant but there are some roasted malts in there to balance it and give some dryness.

The spiciness is still there, but the richness seems to have waned.

Chimay comes from a Belgium Monestary, and has been brewed by the monks since 1863 (1+8+6+3 = 18. My lucky number and Chai in Hebrew = "Life and good luck". Coincidence?) Anyways, Chimay was one of the first premium beers to my knowledge that started driving the prices of up - and made drinking beer, as sophisticated as drinking a fine wine. So - history lesson aside, this still truly is a great beer. Easy to drink - but don't EVER drink this from the bottle. It should still be cherished and enjoyed properly. This ain't no Budweiser (though - I do appreciate a quality Bud as well). Don't rush through this beer. Drink it slowly, but while it's still cold. Enjoy the sweet and malted scents and flavors. I have yet to meet a beer drinker that doesn't like this beer. It's pretty much a quality standard.","SFRider","Oct 01, 2008"

5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"	When I was checking out all the reviews I've written the other day, I couldn't believe that I hadn't yet reviewed my absolute favorite Belgium ale Chimay Grand Reserve. I figured it was my duty to pick up a bottle on the way home and pick up a bottle to write about. I remember trying this about two years ago and not liking it very much, but my palette has since grown. I popped the cork on a 750 ml. bottle and poured a good sample into a Chimay chalice that I got last year in a gift pack. There wasn't much of a head once poured; I took great care not to disturb the yeast sediment resting at the bottom of the bottle. The color was a deep, rusty orange, with very little light penetrating the chalice. The aroma was sublime with hints of dates, figs and yeast. I had read originally that this beer was once only brewed at Christmas time, which does explain why this particular ale reminds me a Barleywine. The taste is sweet, almost like port with deep fruits and a peppery aftertaste. This ale is a champion and should be enjoyed as often as possible. Grab a bottle or two and sit down to enjoy a epic masterpiece.","steelcutoats","Sep 12, 2008"

In the background lurks some esters, malts, hops, and a bready sweetness. A good hint of alcohol heat finishes things off. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied and the active carbonation makes it a bit crispier than expected, but a little creaminess still exists.

Flavors of dark, slightly toasty malt up front followed by spiciness. Very light hints of fruit later on. Strong metallic phenols lead to a tongue-curling finish.

Some say that it is a shadow of its former self- I can't say for sure one way or another, as it has simply been too long since I've had some. I will say that I think it may lack a little sweetness and depth I thought it once had, but whether that is me or the beer I simply can't say. Pours a hazy brown with a decent head. Aromas of spicebox, alcohol, cream, and dark fruit. Not quite seemless, and the alcohol heat is definitely there. The taste is a bit deper, with some breadiness added to the equation and the flavors are more flawlessly integrated than the aromas as well. Nice mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess.

Mouthfeel is smooth and moist, not harsh or bitter in the least. Finish is nice, doesn't linger any longer than necessary. This beer totally surpassed my expectations.

On the palate, there's a dense malty sweet flavor that nearly coats the mouth, while nowhere near cloying. Some spicy alcohol notes blend well with the creamy Munich malt flavors. The finish is big and malty but with just enough bitterness to keep it away from being sweet. Carbonation is medium high, could be a touch higher.

But I had this at a decent bar here in Gainesville with some fun people nearby, so I'm working off of memory. Off the start it's definitely a belgian, it looks great in the chalice in which it was poured. Dark; if you mixed purple, black and brown you might find this color. It had a tan/light brown head. Tasted as it smelled with dark aged fruits and spice, mostly clove, very tasty. This was rather drinkable and certainly wouldn't be offensive for even the unexperienced palate. A very high gravity feeling though. It wasn't quite my style. It reminded me of a lighter colored unibroue (which creates belgian style ales). Although I've seen and tried this style, this was my first actual belgian trappist ale. I have more belgians sitting in my fridge (westmalle, st. bernardus). I look forward to them but hope that belgian beers have more versatility, because this sorta gave me what I might have thought it would taste like... it did not deceive my pre-concieved notions.","joshwlt","Jun 13, 2008"

No lacing to speak of. Smells of ripe dark fruits, raisins, brown sugar, tarry tobacco, bubble gum, black pepper, and a barely noticeable alcohol note. Very carbonated and fizzes quite a bit when lightly swishing. Rich malt flavor that translates into plum, candied dark fruit, cola, caramel, with an alcoholic finish that seems to prevent any cloying affect from the rich maltiness. The mouthfeel has a bit too much carbonation for me but it doesn't seem too out of the ordinary for the style. This may also be part of the anti-cloying. The mild alcoholic finish is nice and warming. There is also some residual flavor and bittness in the cheeks after a few sips. I could have another and would love to pick out more flavors. Quite enjoyable and I would say drinkable for being a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I would love to enjoy this with a nice aged blue cheese.

It smells like dark fruit, raisins, peppery spice, roasted malt and yeast. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the fruit and pepper really stand out. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, rich and has zippy carbonation (maybe a little too much carbonation for me, but it works good in this beer). It's also very smooth and very easy to drink.

Fluffy white head subsided rather quickly settling into a thin consistent layer of foam. Ample, but light lacing with good adherence during the tasting. Immediately presents with a strong nose of dark fruit (plums, prunes, raisins). Taste similar to nose, and much more pronounced than in the Red & White. Mellow mouthfeel with just a touch of carbonation. Alcohol was very well-hidden (deceptively so), making this an extremely drinkable belgian strong.

Pours a thick, foamy head leading to a dark brown, prunish appearance... taste had hints of chocolate, prunes, figs, and other dark fruits including a slight brandy flavor... Very rich and deep taste with a good mouthfeel, and a 9% ABV that is so unnoticeable that it will certainly throw you off if you're not careful... The rich complexity of flavors and the appealing aroma really make this a world-class, outstanding brew...

Flavour is excellent and enhanced by a fantastic mouthfeel. I've had this sitting around for quite a while, but it seemed very fresh and might even have been able to use another year or so of aging.

Pours a slightly darker chestnut brown color with a loose, full finger, light tan head that fades fairly quickly. The smell is more reserved yet deeper than the Achel "Claus" product that i recently sampled. Visibly effervescent, as evidenced by small pools of surface disturbance with a bit more lacing. The mouth feel is notably creamy, in the same manor as the Achel Claus. The flavor is figgy but less pronounced than expected. The 9% ABV has a warming characteristic that is more noticeable than my favorite Strong Dark Ales. The dark fruit flavor is wonderful yet less pronounced than anticipated.

With just a touch of date and cherry. The taste was exquisite, the fruity yet malty combination was perfection.

Medium to full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, warm and clean finish. Drinkable in the sense that you could have a Belgian night and work it in, but too distinctive to mix with other styles.","joekfsu","Dec 29, 2007"

In hindsight, that probably wasn't the most responsible thing to do, but we all had a bit, so no big deal. Poured out a dark color, but more noticeable than its color was its high carbonation and frothy head. Tasted very fruity but with an alcohol and malty-sweet kick. I can't quite put my finger on what the fruits were, but it was definitely fruit-sweet with malts. It was almost wine-like in that regards.

4.03,-6.3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a very nice Belgian Dubbel. The beer pours a cloudy, dark, chocolatey color with a light brown head, some retention, not much lacing. You will find that very typical yeasty carbonation from a Belgian, along with some candied sugar fermentation. The smell is okay, not all that pronounced, but you'll get the aroma of plums, cherries, spices, malts, and very typical Belgian candied sugars. The taste is very smooth, fruity, some spices, a bit tart, like green apples, but it is mostly the caramel, plum, cherry flavors that come through strongest. The down side to this beer, and it is a relative shortcoming, is that the consistency is rather light bodied for a Belgian Dubbel. I was expecting a much more robust, hearty, more syrupy beer. The alcohol is warming, it doesn't have that strong throaty finish, and the aftertaste is just right. It's been awhile since I've had a Chimay, but since my first experience, I've had better Dubbels.

It's dryness actually accentuates the caramelized flavor quite well. All the flavors seemed to be accompanied by a sugary sweetness of molasses/ dark syrup. The Blue has a fairly full body that is nicely balanced by a surprisingly moderate amount of carbonation. Still goes down silky and leaves your mouth dry.

Either this beer is fairly bland or I just have a hard time identifying taste qualities in Belgian beers. I get a little sour tartness and a deeply hidden candied apple taste. I don't get much more.

The smell was that of sweet malts that was very pleasing. The taste was interesting. Since it was a belgian, I knew it was going to be fairly alcoholic (i.e. the 9 %). The initial taste reminded me of a green apple: a sweet yet sour taste that your palette adjusts to. Once it does, the taste becomes more sweet than sour. Towards the finish of the beer, there seemed to be a refreshing taste to it, almost like the feeling your mouth gets after you have had some mint gum. The body was nice, smooth, and full-bodied. This beer went down nice and easy, but it definitely hit me later. While being good tasting, smooth, and nice to drink, the high alcohol content is almost like a sleeper.

Alcohol kind of jumps at your nose a bit. Taste is chewy dark malts mixed with banana, orange, and grape. Phenolics are mild and allow the dark malty character thrive. Finishes slightly drier than the middle and ends with some toasty character. Hay-like hop flavor is mild in the end as well. Mouthfeel is not heavy at all, nor is it slick.

The label lacked any information as to exactly when it was brewed which might have something to do with the average experience I had with this beer. Upon pouring, I noted an active head, lots of carbonation and thus bubbles, yet the head disapaited very quickly. A bit of a disappointment. Nonetheless, some lace did web the glass and I moved on to the nose which was...modest to barely noticeable. Some whispers of aged fruit (maybe) but really nothing else. This of course had a lot to do with the taste which was very subtle. Notes of aged prunes and raisens but not much else. Sure, some candied sugar caught my attention but what a ho-hum taste. Mouthfeel was as uneventful as the aroma and taste. Watery comes to mind. No viscous blanket to the tongue. Nada. It's drinkable I suppose, but I don't think this is a beer I will seek out again.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with some tingly carbonation. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste but the effect adds up so this limits the amount. Overall, an excellent dark Belgian that I'll certainly have again.","uconnalum2","Mar 30, 2007"

The aroma didn't seem to carry much else, however I have recently quit smoking, and am only just getting some of my smell back. The taste was even, with a yeasty flavor predominate and a fruity flavor that seemed to be skirting the edge of the taste. There is that aftertaste I have noticed with Strong Belgian Ales, the sweet alcohol taste that will sometimes linger on your tongue briefly. I did enjoy the mouthfeel. It is a very carbonated beer with a lot of bubbles that play over your tongue. This is a solid Strong Ale with good characteristics. However, after trying it, I would be more likely to try something I haven't had yet. The flip side of the coin is that if I were offered this beer, I wouldn't turn it down.","JGS","Mar 18, 2007"

Sharp bite on the touch from high carbonation and the alcohol.

The taste is similar to the smell, Belgian yeast & candi sugar, hints of figs and prunes towards the end. This tastes like a dark tripel. Well bodied and carbonated, a bit silky.

It has a very fluffy tan head thats about two inches tall and doesnt fade away too quickly, it has some good lacing and its body is a dark amber color that offers you some good eye candy.

The best description I could come up with was a little fusel mixed with some banana.

There is a faint yeast flavor, which is just enough so that it doesn't take away from the flavor. It has an incredibly smooth feel, and is almost dangerously drinkable. It is 9% ABV, but the alcohol, while noticeable, does not overpower the flavor of the malt. For such a dark, malty beer, it does not even feel too heavy. This is a truly amazing beer.","CardinalBrewing","Oct 28, 2006"

A very pleasant aroma. And damn that's good flavor. Tastes very malty with some orange notes. Slight alcohol vapor on the backend, but it is 9% so that's to be expected. Very enjoyable flavor. The mouthfeel is very pleasant as well, it actually seems to foam up when it hits my tongue and create a very thick full mouthfeel.

I found the smell a bit lacking, I was a little stuffed up but very little by way of smell especially considering this beer fantastic taste. Sweet, creamy, hoppy, with a slight bitterness to chase.

Extremely well hidden for 9% abv, though a warmness does touch the face. Very flavorful, one I wouldn't get tired of drinking though the 9% abv would definitely make itself known.

Pours a gorgeous brownish black with a dense head of tiny bubbles that sits for quite a while, fed by a steady stream of "me too"s running up the sides of the chalice. The smell is lovely, the spice from the oh-so-recognizable yeast mixing with notes of raisin and chocolate. The taste is yeast up front, spicy on the tip of the tongue, then melting to a nutela-like mix and a warming alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is very good, slippery on the tongue and maybe just a whisker thin to support the strong malty/yeasty flavors. The carbonation is excellent and balances the dark character of the beer nicely. The drinkability is excellent. It goes down very easily for a 9 percenter. The brothers definitely got some divine intervention on this one.","roblowther","Aug 22, 2006"
4.15,-3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a snifter, pretyt impressive dark brown with a nice fluffy carmel head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell is of fresh ripe fruits apples with a hint of maltiness and some fresh bread. Taste is very complex tastes like warm apple cider with hints of roasted goodness maybe with some nice yeast touches in there. This was a very good drink the alcohol was very masked and this drink went down very smooth, it stated on the bottle to let it warm up a bit, but I finished it to quickly because of the smoothness of this, I guess next one I drink I will let it warm up a bit to see if another flavor comes out of it.

This pours a deep brown color and there is a lot of evervescence noticeable the entire time. The aroma is fantastic and somewhat hoppier then I expected from a Belgian ale. This beer drinks more like a wine then a beer, and I think should be sipped and savored slowly to truly appreciate it. Very complex flavors, some malty sweetness, a little sourness, and more then a hint of hops present. What I thought was particularly interesting was if you take a good sized sip and hold it in your mouth for a few seconds, you can feel the carbonation on your tongue. Almost reminiscent of the effect Pop-Rocks or champagne would have. Fantastic beer, but I find it a little pricey to drink on anything other then a special occassion.","Generik420","Aug 21, 2006"

Sweet caramel-dipped cherry flavors begin the sip with a cinnamon-roll doughiness at the middle. Allspice and white pepper shore up the back end right before an alcohol-bitter finish. Slick and actively carbonated peppery mouthfeel, medium-to-thin body. As it warms, the mouthfeel becomes fluffier, but not enough to make this outstanding for me.

Pours a dark color with an eggplant color, sort of black, purple and brown all at the same time. There was a large white head at first, that soon faded into a small white one leaving no residue on the side of the glass. Smell was of dark fruits: raisins, plums, cherries, some sweet sugars also. When i smelled this one i got a bit too close and actually snorted some by accident, oh well if there was ever a beer that I actually wanted to snort i guess it would be this one. Anyway, taste was very sweet and rich, with sugar, juicy fruit, figs, molasses, honey, literally a huge spectrum of tastes going to and fro throughout this beer. Mouthfeel was also exceptional, as it was full bodied and delicious. Let this one swirl around the palate, and notice how many new tastes come through with each taste. I would love to drink these as often as i can, it is that good. This is my favorite out of the other Chimays. Next time i'm gonna have to cellar one or two of these.

4.15,-3.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark caramel brown color, with some nice looking amber highlights. A decent oatmeal colored, half inch head forms. Quickly fades, leaving some very spotty lacing, not much. Refreshing green apple smell combined with spices, cloves, and a touch of alcohol. Taste pretty much mimics the smell and finishes with some hop bitterness. Leaves that nice alcohol warm feeling in the gut. Excellent mouthfeel, very smooth, very creamy and full bodied, a bit chewy. An easy brew to drink, even with the 9% abv. An absolute pleasure, let this one warm up to room temp. My first from Chimay, and a good impression was made!","BigDaddyWil","May 16, 2006"

My first impression was a fruity aroma, cherries mixed with plums. The pour left an excellent head that lingered for quite some time. The taste was a superb mix of sweet malt, blackberries and cherries with a slight hop finish. This a beer I love to drink as a special treat.

Taste is sweet brown sugar, plums, coriander and a meek hop presence. Mouthfeel is lively. Honestly, I'm not too thrilled with this. Sure, it's one of my favorite styles, but there are so many other beers out there that do it better imo.

The taste was very nice however, quite malty and spicy with notes of chocolate, maple syrup, dark fruit and caramel. It also had a pleasing alcoholic warmth.

The dominant characters now seem to be a pleasing caramel and toffee malt component along with raisins and figs. The yeast has receded a bit, but there's still a fair bit of breadiness. Overall, it's quite smooth and malty - to me it's improved with a bit of aging.

Pours a pretty garnet-brown color with ruby highlights, topped by a creamy khaki-colored head that dissipates a bit more quickly than I would like. Aroma of slightly sweet European malt, Belgian yeast, and notes of raisin and bread, with an underlying whiff of alcohol. Palate is understated - sweet, honeyish malt blended with a touch of Euro hops. Notes of spicy yeast, raisins, plums, and very faint caramel are present. Finish is nice and warm, so as not to let you forget the alcohol content. Body is nice and creamy, but also a tad foamy. Still, right on the mark for the Trappist style.

I am not saying it is not a good beer, it is actually quite refined in texture (crisp, medium body) and balancing of the high alcohol level but just lacked a full or deep flavor. Or, perhpas I should just say that it was a little too subtle for a Friday night at the bar. I suspect the mild sweetness and spiciness will pair well with rich and/or spicy food.

Every time I drink a bottle straight from the store or at a bar, I feel like it is an underdeveloped, uncomplicated baby of a beer. Sure its loaded with dark fruits, candied sugar, and lovely Belgian yeasts. They just arent very exciting. Liekwise, the body is reasonably depthful and lightly sour but it lacks vitality.

Taste is consistent with the style and quite good ... very earthy, rich, and complex with the yeast/malt interplay. This one (blue label) has a considerable hop profile as well, adding complexity and a balance to the sweet malt and fruits. This ale has a pleasing warmingeffect and is quite "alive" with carbonation and alcohol. Finish is silky and well balanced with a lingering warmth. I've always favored the Chimay blue for some reason, over the others. A standard in my book. If you've not tried it, try it. Among the best in the world?

Fusel alcohol in the nose, some roasted malt and dark fruit aromas, and belgian phenols. Sweet dark malt flavor, a hint of plum, and a faint grape skin taste make up a complex palate. Phenols are strong in the aftertaste, and the fusels become spicy- leaving the mouthfeel a touch dry. The carbonation is mild, and the body is medium to full- but subtle hops and spicy alcohol give it a delicate crispness.

The flavor is sweet, with too much root beerishness, probably helped by a vinous quality. Carbonation is also reminiscent of soda, and at the end there is a sugar/alcohol coating in my mouth. Overall a bit hot, yet soda-like. I have had this a few times and, while I don't remember being thrilled with it (I always preferred the red), I do not remember the blue being this lackluster.

Smells of spicy fruits with a bready overtone and some alcoholic notes as well. Tastes beautiful, raisins and cloves with the classic belgian breadiness and not even a hint of the 9% ABV, which is hidden magnificently. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and nicely warming.

It has that characteristic Belgian funk that really adds to the experience by making it taste and feel more substantial. I don't know what kind of hops were used, but they were fantastic. To top it all off, this beer is 9%ABV and doesn't taste like it at all and probably even adds to the thickness this beer exudes. After downing this and a few yuenglings I was glad I ate that steak earlier.","LordChesterfield","Dec 22, 2005"

The appearance was as expected; burgundy color with a lovely head that stays around. Aromas of plums, grapes, alcohol, and caramelized sugar come out, but they don't seem to be working together. This was my first inkling that I was in for a surprise. The taste was just too much with overwhelming sweetness upfront followed by a moist bitterness that left me not wanting anymore.

Taste was along the same lines; Flavors of earth, herbs, spices, malt and yeast are noticeable, with nuances of roasted nuts and aged tobacco. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich, giving no indication of the 9%ABV. Drinkability for some reason doesn't seem all that high, as I think this brew is one you'd only want every once in awhile.

As it moves back and you swallow it, the light, dry hops add some bite. This is the reverse to a lot of beers I've had where the dryness leads and the malt finishes.

The nose and taste is incredibly complex, just as complex as any good red wine that I have had. On the nose you get a nice sweetness, maybe figs??? Some of the medicinal phenol. man, this is some good stuff. Rasins some nice hoppiness, the question is what can't you smell, this is really complex. This goes for the taste as well. Sweetness, with a nice bite at the end. I have died and gone to beer heaven, I would love to pair this beer with some real gammy meat. Maybe rabbit, venison, or duck.

Has a fruity aroma with bananas, raisins, lemons, cloves, spiciness, nuts, and yeast. The beer tastes sweet with cloves, phenols, alcohol, and hops in the background. Leaves a warming sensation. Lots of flavor that is blended well and is slightly cloying. Beer feels somewhat thick and has a crisp carbonation at first that becomes very creamy.

Nose is of powered sugar, fresh fruit, and concord grapes.

4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The simple but attractive blue-labelled Chimay bottle with a best before of 2008 on the back right corner poured a dark chestnut liquid into my chalice, topped with a head befitting for a Trappist. A dark beer, untransparent, dense and full looking. Held to the light the red becomes apparent, as does the caramel-tinged edges. Against a purely white background though, this beer is dark rosewood or chestnut. A very light brown head, dark cream coloured. At first it was a good mixture of medium and small sized bubbles; after a few sips, the head formed up and became dense and solid, though not exceptionally large. From above, this beer could pass for the top of a moccha coffee. Swirling the glass creates a lighter-coloured swirl, like a hurricane seen from the top. Fine screen lacing that fragments quickly. The nose is all fruits and malt at first. I get some green apple peel, figs, prunes, red grapes(red wine for that matter), and raisins. The malt translates as light caramel, fresh yeast, extremely sweet chocolate, but NOT the same chocolate character as in some stouts. The mustiness of the yeast is also present, but only behind the sweet malt and yeasty esters. As in all complex beers, there are some aromas that seem to defy identification. Little hop presence in aroma, or taste. The taste is sweet, but less so than the aroma may have led you to expect. Instead, the alcohol is quite noticeable, gently abrasive to the tongue. Grapes and malty sugar at first on the tongue, the phenols in the middle, and some metallic maltiness in the aftertaste, also leaving some unexpected bitterness, but it does not taste like hop dryness--this is more metallic in nature, like iron or some wines. Indeed, the finish is slightly bitter in a red-wine manner, leaving a red wine taste on the palate quite strongly. A medium carbonation, perfect for the style, sufficiently creamy but tingling in the mouth; and for a strongly flavoured Trappist, the drinkability is magnificent. This pairs agreeably with aged cheddar, or even medium cheddar. This is a Trappist that needs to be tasted repeatedly, as all the nuances can simply not be detected on the first try. In addition, different food pairings can make this beer exciting and different almost perpetually.","Cwrw","Jan 31, 2005"
4.25,-1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a dark, reddish that is very clear and a white two inch fluffy head that subsided to a thin ring. Aroma was dry with a nice mineral character mingling with dark fruity esters. The flavor is very smooth and clean with more of the malt flavor dominating than in a fresh example. Rich dark fruit flavors interplay with a subdued dry malt flavor that is more balanced in the aged version. As this bottle aged I believe that it attenuated a bit more which resulted in an overall cleaner impression of the flavor. CO2 levels are high but the beer still remains smooth with no carbonic bite. Overall a very enjoyable ale that having been aged takes on a smoother more drinkable nature while also gaining a touch of oxidation which imparts a subtle raisin flavor. The flavor seems more round than a in a fresh example and having had this one I would recommend that all chimays of adequate strength be aged for at least a year.","RenoZymurgist","Jan 31, 2005"

The taste was warming and mellow with the very sweet fruity malt chasing the dusty yeast and powered cocoa into the background. It was not as complex as other Trappist ales, but was quite satisfying in its own way. Full bodied and sticky, with a lingering spicy dry aftertaste, and just a touch of grassy hops.

Last time I had it out of one of the small bottles, so it didn't have a chance to warm to room temp like this bigger bottle did. Once it reached room temperature, this was actually quite delicious even with the subdued clove flavor.

Taste was quite complex, starts with dark fruits, malts kick in the middle and then some hops and bitterness in the finish. Very smooth, and not as sweet as I remembered. The high ABV is rather nicely hidden, making this dangerously drinkable... Considering popping one of these of New Year's if I can find one.","tatterdash","Dec 13, 2004"

Taste is of dark fruity malt to start fading into a smooth slightly detectable alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is good, lively but not overly carbonated. Overall drinkability is good.

Appropriate level of mild carbonation. Aroma is earthy and somewhat musty. Perhaps some grape too. Flavor profile is moderate malt with that Belgian yeast character, not a strong candi sugar presence. Minimal bitterness but detectable. A little rough. Medium to full bodied. Alcohol is subtle.

The aroma is as complex as the flavor and you would need a book to properly describe it. It has a very sweet, spicy malty character that is a mind blowing experience. The only thing holding this beer back is it's price... $13 at my local liquor store. That said, I buy it whenever I feel the need to pamper myself with a great Belgian beer.

The aroma was a little more subtle than I expected. The aromatics I did pick up were mostly slight hints of grainy maltiness and a little bit of raisin and fruit. The flavor was dominated by a complex maltiness, with a hint of caramel and some slight fruitiness and an alcoholic warmth. Some hop bitterness was present to balance but overall this was a malty beer. Some herbaly, wood-like notes at the end of the tasting add a nice touch. Tasty and complex but I'm afraid it isn't as interesting to me as it once was. Still, a classic and delicious.","KroMagnon","Nov 04, 2004"

Yeasty, dark candi sugars and malty, some ripe fruit esters, and lighter, toastier malts are all traits of the nose. Dark malty taste, with a pungent yeastiness and dark fruit notes with a light astringency in the finish that is cleansing. Higher carbonation level keeps the beer feeling airy on the tongue. I feel this is the most tasty and complex brew of the Chimay line. I'm not sure why Chimay is treated unfairly; sure they may have tweaked recipes over time, but all of their beers are still world class.

Fruity malts up front followed by the Chimay spicyness and peppery notes. ( is it the yeast) Alcohol is there but not overwhelming. Nice and smooth mouthfeel-- full but not chewy.

Mouthfeel is fine to much carbonation otherwise pretty good.

While not absolutely staggering, earth-shattering good, it's a very fine brew indeed, worthy of the reputation that it holds. Regretably, however, I have a little bit of a stopped up nose at the moment. As such, my sense of smell and taste are a little bit impaired. Even still, I can easily smell the yeast and spice, so typical of this style, emanting from my glass. Quite strong. A dark ruby, murky rust colour, this stuff had a nice three-quarter inch slightly off-white head on it when I poured it. Now it has subsided to little more than a frosty haze over the surface. Excellent thick, sticky lacing coats the sides of my glass, and the smell of yeast and spices is only amplified when you take a drink. The mouth feel is quite smooth and easy to drink, inspite of the carbonation level being a little bit higher than I would have anticipated. The fact that this is a 9.0%abv is well disguised. It does have a little bit of a warming sensation as it goes down, but not even close to being unpleasant or overpowering. This is my first "baptising" with Chimay, and now I'm even more excited about having the white and red label ones. Certainly I will have this again. Very Impressed.","SilentSabre","Sep 01, 2004"

The appearance is fascinating, a darkly tan amber color that refracts the light into reddish hues. The head is thick and tenacious. The aroma is heaven - darkly sweet bread with raisins, plums and perhaps a hint of mango laced with molasses or brown sugar. The yeast is evident also, moreso as this delectable nectar warms to nearer room temperature. Taste is exquisite. The perfectly-balanced hops compliment the slight yeast flavor as the sweet dark fruit courses through your palate. The head traps the volitiles and lasts for the length of the glass. The taste becomes more and more complex as the ale warms. The mouthfeel is crisp and peppery for such a dark ale, in part due to the perfect carbonation. This beer is very drinkable because of the excellent taste, but you'd be inebriated after the second one.","kosmoraios","Aug 08, 2004"

The smell was of bananna and spice and a subtle hint of mustyness as well. The taste was so fucking good with its perfect blend of bananna, clove spices and a touch of pepper flavor in the finnish. Hops are next to nothing in here but there is much flavor to this beer regardless. My bottle was dated 07/03 so after being aged a year, I'd say it tastes pretty damn good!

I like this Blue better than the Tripel, but I can definently tell Belgian ales aren't my thing. Appearance is really dark, not quite coffee colored, but close. Head is moderate height, but quite creamy. The head never quite goes away and leaves a thin layer on top of the beer. Smell is of spices, slight apple smell. Taste is mainly of spices, reminds me of something I'd have around Christmas. Smoother than the tripel I had yesterday, but similiar. 9% alcohol is barely tasted, but noted by a warming of my stomach.

The smell is nicely yeasty with toasted dark malts and a light banana aroma; some hints of cream and butter too. The taste shows some fruity aspects, bananas and apples, but is mostly yeasty, with a very round and full maltiness that gives the beer a very nice bready aspect. Like cereal bread, partly melting in the mouth. A very warming alcohol feeling circles the mouth, and maybe some light nots of citrus.

4.27,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"750ml Corked bottle with 01/03 on cork. Poured a reddish brown with a creamy tan head that settled down to a thin film. Aroma is spicy and with lots of yeast present. Peppery and slightly floral. Body is smooth and creamy and with an even carbonation. The flavor is a fruity malty one with yeast and sugar notes. Overall a fine Belgian that is the most available one I can think of.","BierReise","Mar 11, 2004"

The taste is exceptional even for a Trappist ale. It starts with a sweet maltiness that has real grapey undertones. The taste ends with an alcohol hit that is ameliorated by the fruitiness. One of the few beers that I rate a 5 in taste. It feels almost perfect in the mouth with some real body, nice carbonation, and a lingering taste of fruit. I rate this down a little in drinkability just because of the alcohol content. It is drinkable from first drop to last, but one, even splitting one, is enough to affect the motor skills.","rdrummer","Mar 11, 2004"

Smell is sweet--ripe plums. Taste is sweet with plums and dark grapes mingled with a hint of alcohol for a nice warming effect with each sip. The mouthfeel is full is body and there is a nice crispness with each sip from the fine carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but the high ABV certainly creeps up on you quickly.

The smell was very musty and yeasty. Also quite fruity. The taste was less sweet than I expected considering some of the other strong dark ales I've sampled, but that's not disappointing in the least. Dried raisons and plums and wild musty yeast flavors filled my mouth and nose, followed by a generous amount of warming alcohol. Quite pleasing. Mouthfeel was very creamy and thick, also quite carbonated and filling. Drinkability was hampered by the richness, although I still say it's good considering I'm almost done with the 750 as I write this. An amazing offering from one of the big 6 true Trappist Abby's.

Everything blended very well together, and all I could make out were notes of alcohol and biscuity malts. A bit overwhelming. This was part 3 of a 3 part vertical Chimay tasting.

This is actually quite a bit better than I was expecting it to be. It is fairly light on the palate, especially given its strength, but it does have a slightly lingering rich malt note to it. It is pretty fruity with concentrated notes of raisin and fig, as well as some spicy yeast notes that hint at ginger, cardamom, and clove.

A new bottle leaves a slight twinge on the tongue from the alcohol, but the bottle I am reviewing is one I have been aging for 1 1/2 yrs, and let me say, it ages quite well, the overall flavors blend more, and the alcohol balances out and isnt overwhelming.

Limited nose thats short on depth and lacks potency: alcohol and rich maltiness surpasses the plums, apples and candy aromas. Still its inviting. Tasty palate with a fair amount of depth, excellent balance as well. The flavor profile is richly malty, plums and apples too, yeasty bready, caramelized candy-sugar, spiciness of figs, clove, and pepper. The alcohol is hidden on the tongue. The finish is tart and heavy on the carbonation pretty nice but its too abrupt and only the pepper remains on the aftertaste. Disappointing its hard to savory a beer that disappears from your tongue so quickly. Medium light body spritzy carbonation. The high abv is noticeable on your mind. Chimay Blue lacks a certain complexity needed to be truly outstanding. If I have this one again, Id go with the smaller capped bottle and not the corked rendition. I think this beer is highly overrated try one if you must. Yawn...","bditty187","Jul 16, 2003"

The smell was of dark malt and was not astringent in any way compared to the beers overall darkness. Tasted exceptional with a thorough maltiness and subdued hops that kept it in a somewhat balance but the malt is the predominant flavor with alcohol not being apparent at all within this elixir. All together a very drinkable beer that I find to be rewarding experience each every time I drink. Only problem I find with this beer is that it is much to drinkable given its high abv.","leeenglewood","Jul 09, 2003"

The flavors, of course, are quite complex and balanced. In attempting to grasp the predominant flavor, I bounced a sip on the front of my tongue for several seconds. The affect was simply amazing. There was an enormous sense of hot pepperiness. Not unpleasant, in fact, quite the opposite. There was an element of dried fruit in the taste along with almond oil, nuts, and roasted grain.

My tongue was alive. Flavors of a rich dark malt, apples, wood (again like it came from a wooden apple barrel) light spices to accompany the apples and the boom of the alcohol weaved itself all through the other flavors.

Same goes for the taste. It's also got some ripe bananna and apple flavors with a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's a bit harsh due to the high carbonation and ABV, but after a glass or two of this, you'll be too buzzed to notice, not that I condone using this beer as a means of getting drunk (unless you can afford to.

Flavor is malty sweet with a creamy body -- quite luxurious. Malt takes on a slightly roasted flavor mid-palate, where it is complemented by a variety of spicy notes, a slight apple-like tartness, and the warming sensation of alcohol. Finish is just hopped enough for balance, and is slightly smoky in flavor. Aftertaste is a bit sour. Reading back on this review, those descriptors (smoky, sour, apple-like, roasty) don't seem to go well together, but it is the wonder of Chimay that it manages to pull it off with style.

The lower 2/3 of the head has a medium density bubble, while the upper 1/3 has a very fine bubble density and looks very creamy. The head retention on this beer is fantastic, and it leaves an enticing lace. The aroma has a maltiness to it, but also exhibits many earthy tones, as well as a hint of orange peel. The flavor is simply an explosion of taste. Definite citus notes, very heavy on the orange peel, but followed by caramel sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable. There also seems ot be a spiciness to the beer, with pepper and maybe a hint of coriander in the finish. There is so much going on it is hard to isolate the flavors, which blend together into a beautiful kaleidoscope of taste. The mouthfeel is superb, with a slightly thick feel, yet not overpowering. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer regularly, but couldn't have many in one sitting. Having tried this, I now know what many American interpretations of the Belgian Strong Ale style are attempting to present. Where many fall short, this beer comes up big. Obviously a classic that I should have enjoyed sooner.","aaronh","Nov 18, 2002"
4.43,3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours into the Chimay goblet a deep, dark wood-stain amber crowned with a large white Belgian head, which stays beautifully like a blanket of snow. Wonderfully complex and immense aroma of freshly cut oranges with a little banana and other subtle fruit, possibly strawberry, along with some spicy dried fruit and a hint of pepper. What a flavor! First, sweet caramel with a spicy outer shell rolls in. The next wave hits in the middle of the palate, pepper rides in on the edges of fresh fruit, tangy orange, sweet banana, and berries. Alcohol warms the mouth near the end, and is noticeable in the aftertaste and with retro-olfaction. Caramel malt is again present in the finish. Due to the malty backbone, the mouthfeel isn't totally dominated by carbonation as it can sometimes be in other Belgian-style beers. However, that big backbone also makes it slightly less drinkable. The keyword there is "slightly". I'd like to stress that this is a true masterpiece of a beer that does not need high drinkability for enjoyment, especially since you'd only want to drink one or two of these at a time due to the high alcohol content. Not that you won't be thirsty for more of this mouth-watering elixir. I'd love to have some Chimay cheese to pair with this. I picked this up today in a gift pack containing this and the other two widely known Chimay offerings as well as the signature chalice for only $10.99.

The aroma is dominated by yeast with hints of fresh fruit and flowers.  The flavor is a combination of roasted malt and dried fruit.  As the beer warmed, it seemed to take on more of a woody/earthy flavor.  Very nice.  For a 9% brew, it is deceivingly smooth in the mouth.

Healthy, lively head over an earthy dark brown beer. Fruit, caramel and toffee in the aroma. As with the Westy, the flavor seemed to morph as I drank it, something like liquid Grape Nuts.

The finish is clean and slightly fruity.  The aerated mouth-feel does not at all harsh the brew.  I am really developing a love for Belgian Ales.","beernut7","Sep 12, 2002"
4.79,11.4,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"750ml bottle, corked & caged. Hazy with yeast & sediment in suspension. Dark tawny copper with reddish highlights. The slight head is made up of very fine light tan bubbles that cannot hold. Lace is limited as well (probably linked to the high alcohol and youth of the bottle). One would hope that a greater head will develop with age. The aroma is rich with dark fruit, candyish notes, alcohol and a toasted maltiness. The body is medium with a lively but gentle effervescence from tiny bubbles, giving a zesty-spritzy mouthfeel that compliments the spice and pepper notes of the beer. The flavor is sweet with a soft, fruity character that's reminiscent of all the Chimay beers, and delicately balanced by bitterness and spice. Swirling flavors of dark fruits, spicy complex alcohols and soft chocolate-like malts combine in a light, but impressive display across the palate. The alcohol is not overly aggressive but still quite noticeable in this, Chimay's strongest beer at 9%. The finish is somewhat thin with a slightly dry lingering aftertaste. At times I've considered each of the 3 Chimay beers to be my favorite, which I see as a great tribute to the monastery. This particular vintage is a bit young at present, but it's still quite unique and very enjoyable as it is. A year of cellaring should improve it greatly.","NeroFiddled","Aug 28, 2002"
4.33,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep color in color with a nice amount of tan head.  Fruit flavors are dominant, but quickly followed by the signature belgian yeast.  Very complex beer as the more you drink, the more flavors are revealed.  ABV is noticeable, but did not detract from the brew.","jreitman","Aug 25, 2002"
5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Very dark amber in color with tight cream color foam. Nice pleasant complex smell and taste of fruits and roasted nuts. Slightly on the sweet side with a tangy but not bitter finish. Just a little sourness on the after taste also. Best Belgium brew so far!","BeerManDan","Aug 07, 2002"
4.3,0,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750ml bottle date stamped 10/01 on the cork. Pours a deep rich copper color. Tight thin tan head, rather foamy and flavorful. Lots of complex smells, rum roasted plums, and other fruits along with big belgium yeasty smells. Nothing dominates, just complicates.  Nice subtle tastes however. Rich rum soaked fruits hit your taste buds, first, then some yeast middle. Lots of subtle tastes present. Alcohol is noticable, and makes for a thin feel. I would make this an after dinner night cap beer, not one to guzzle down with dinner. I expected something more spectacular, but still a very good belgian ale.","StevieW","Jul 29, 2002"
4.72,9.8,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Poured very dark, almost like a port.  Big creamy tan head with little bubbles stayed throughout most of the time.  Smells of port, with hints of nutmeg and figs, maybe.  Althought the taste is rich and powerful, it is far from overwhelming.   It is so smooth and wonderful, I seem to forget how good this beer really is.   This is a sweet beer, full of flavor, with such character, it is unique and stands alone.","AaronRed","Jul 02, 2002"
2.76,-35.8,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Ehhhhh I expected more out of this. Pours nearly black with a thin lace on top. This will kick you square in the balls at 9% and that alcohol taste is prevalent. I found the taste very similar to Duvel, but much more bitter. Duvel is good...this stuff was not.","IrishRedRock","Jun 23, 2002"
4.12,-4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Nice and evident but restrained aroma of berries, maybe strawberries. Darker, opaque brown color, mound-holding 1/2 inch head. Deep woodsy flavor, touch of caramelized oak barrel and a back-taste of brown sugary notes. Quite light-bodied and spritzy, the final impression is fuller and very pleasant. Very distinct flavor, nice. Alcohol has more of an effect on the brain than in the taste.","ADR","Jun 18, 2002"
4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"It's a nice dark red to brown with a healthy beige head. Spice and hops are noticeable in the smell. It has a slightly yeasty flavor with a fruity flavor close to raisin and a nice spicy kick. It's well-balanced and the smell and flavor of alcohol are barely detectable. A very nice beer.","mickeymac","Jun 06, 2002"
3.55,-17.4,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Pours dark ruby with a great head that melds into "rolling hills" as the head ever so gradually dissipates.  There's a pungent yeast aroma.  Slight amount of fruity esters on the nose too.  Fair amount of carbonation.  Goes down the hatch fairly smooth for a 9% a/v.  Either this beer is fairly bland or I just have a hard time identifying taste qualities in Belgian beers.  I get a little sour tartness and a deeply hidden candied apple taste.  I don't get much more.  It is a very drinkable high alcohol beer without a lot of appealing flavors in my opinion.  Blasphemy I know being such a highly regarded Trappist brew.","Bighuge","May 30, 2002"
4.97,15.6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"An outstanding beer, very close to "perfect". I agree with all the positive things said by other reviewers, and has little more to add. The spicy, oaky complexity of the aroma and flavour is "out of this world". Wonderful, lingering aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden. Simply exceptional!","Sigmund","May 29, 2002"
4.3,0,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A great beer, dry palate with decently bitter finish, hints of chocolates, cloves, caramel (quite malty). Not my favoured Chimay, but damn good non the less.","rastaman","May 13, 2002"

4.4,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Everything about this beer was great except I couldn't drink the whole bottle. Nice pour, bits of spice but mostly fruit on the nose. The Red and Blue were available in MN. I heard the Red was better but never got to it, now I can't find it. One thing though, make sure the bottle wasn't either overly cold or sitting warm. Everybody I know ended up with an inconsistent bottle or a bad tongue.","packetknife","May 03, 2002"
4.85,12.8,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is one of those beer-nirvana experiences. You can tell by the look (ruby-brown, rich tan head), and the aroma (dark fruit, spice, brown sugar, pepper), that this is special. The taste is so complex, yet so balanced, that God must be playing a part in there somewhere (and I am not necessarily a religious man!). Sweet, dry finish. This is a world-class beer!","mophie","Apr 26, 2002"
4.73,10,4.5,4,5,5,5,"This from a batch/or bottled in Jan. '01, purchased on the day of my Daughter's birth, aged with a LOT of patience for exactly 1 year in my cellar. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy ruby-ish hue, with the usual lively& effervescent Chimay head, nose is oh so slightly corky, with the "horse blanket" bouquet present. Taste - smooth maltiness followed by a nice complexity of (in order of domination)malt yeast & hops...the aftertaste just seems to evolve everytime I smack my lips, with just enough hop bitterness to make themselves known. Beautiful, a great bottle enjoyed on a great occasion! Beers of this magnitude are meant to be savored for special times.","beerluvr","Apr 20, 2002"
4.28,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Muddy brown hue, w/ hazy deep ruby when held to light. Dense, thick, creamy and smooth light tan head is well retained. Suspended aggregates of yeast from the bottle conditioning. Yeast esters are surprisingly mild, consisting of mild clove and peppermint are perceptible along with pleasantly mellow tart fruit. Nutty, dark caramel malt surface in aroma as the beer warms. The taste is initially quite sweet with raisin like contributions from the dark crystal malt (special B?) Caramelized dark candi sugar notes are also present, but aren't assertive. Mid palate dryish chocolate malt coupled w/ the light hop bitterness lend a bittersweet note and tart fruity esters akin to unripe plums emerge. Moderate in body, w/ a smooth, dextrinous and agreeable mouthfeel that helps facilitate the superb drinkability. Finishes w/ notes of maple sugar and woodiness lingering briefly on the palate. This 750 ml is quite young, being bottled 9/01. Certainly worthy of cellaring. Although not the most complex Dark Strong, Grande Reserve is refined in overall character, being both very flavorful, yet restrained enough to prevent any cloying qualities. Delicious. I'm re-reviewing this. The 750 ml bottle is much more balanced and tasty all around. A true classic.","marc77","Apr 07, 2002"

4.8,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"33 cl bottle, not dated.  An excellent beer, no doubt.  Another one of the world class beers that are so drinkable at 9% but it just didn't have the depth I was anticapating.  Maybe I drank it too young but I'd much rather have a 75 cl bottle of Trios Pistoles for the same price.","pbrian","Mar 04, 2002"
5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Presentation: 33cl (11.2oz.) capped bottle. Exceptional brew all the way around. Gorgeous dark and hazy appearance. Big malty sweetness blends with peppery yeast spiciness and pleasant alcohol warming sensation. A brew to savor on a special occasion.","John","Jan 21, 2002"
4.36,1.4,5,4,4,5,5,"This is one beer that will make you silly quicker than you would ever expect..  It's STRONG, but it tastes so good (very complex fruit notes), you'd never realize what it's doing to you..  This is made by monks?!?  They must have a wicked sense of humor..","bk3nj","Dec 05, 2001"
5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer demands respect.  To fully appreciate it, it should be drank at the proper temperature, and hope that you have a good bottle, because the quality can vary.  But if you get one of the good bottles....it's heaven.  Incredible head and aroma, with a surprisingly light, fruity complex taste for its dark color.  And some serious 9% kick.  Drinking this beer at a campground near the brewery in Chimay, Belgium (where a 750ml bottle is $2.50) was a religious experience.","mmthompson33","Oct 22, 2001"
