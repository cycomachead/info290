Tastes are the aforementioned raisins and plums, but some up front mint is on the tongue too. Maybe a bit of sweet molasses on the swallow. A good solid craft brew, but the hyperbole swirling around this one, exceeded the actual experience of drinking it.","BeerWatcher","Thursday at 06:40 AM"

The taste is dominated by that wonderful ‘Belgian’ profile of yeast, bread, candied sugar and caramel.  The high carbonation keeps this 9%’er highly drinkable.","mtomlins","Mar 23, 2015"

Smell:  very rich-- again some chocolate and sweetness.  Taste was awesome as I'm a big fan of smoothness over bitterness.  This 9%'er nailed it and had a sweet spice aftertaste that made me want more.

You'll taste the raisins or plums, cinnamon and sugars.  Not sweet though.  Very mild and abv is unnoticeable even though at 9.  Easy drinking beer you can enjoy over a long sporting event.

This is a "dark ale on lees" (meaning the leftover sediment and dead yeast - don't let that turn you off) with spices. Smell is heavy with dark fruits, like prunes and raisins, and some pepper. Nearly pitch black color with nice head. Taste is smooth and heavily malty with the same dark fruits but minimal pepper. No hops detected here even though I know they're there. Very smooth mouthfeel with a sweetness that lingers. At 9% ABV it is a true sipper.","Summerteeth","Jan 27, 2015"

If I were to do this blind I seriously doubt I could distinguish this from any of my favorite Belgian ales in this category.  Perfect balance.  Bready with dark fruit mixed in.  Nice.

P: The aroma accentuates the taste giving you a mildly carbonated dark fruit and malty smooth mouthful. Followed by a slight and pleasant alcohol after taste. O: I really enjoyed this brew.

I also get nice mild notes of vanilla extract along with some alcohol which adds another nice layer of complexity. Mouth feel is smooth and full with lots of soft carbonation.","generallee","Sep 23, 2014"

4.41,4.3,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Bucky bought a 6 pack of Unibroue's Trois Pistoles at The Beer Store for $14.95... about $2.50 per 341 ml bottle. Trois Pistoles was 9.0% alcohol by volume, with a production date of September 11, 2011 printed on the neck. This particular bottle has been sitting in my cold seller for about 14 months. A warning for those of you who have aged your Trois Pistoles for a while...about two seconds after you open the bottle a whole lot of foam will come gushing out of the bottle, so be ready with the glass. Trois Pistoles poured a dark mahogany colour, with about 2" of fizzy beige head that faded to a thin cap and collar within 3-4 minutes, leaving a little spotting down the glass. Its aroma was fabulous...plums, powdered sugar, pink bubble gum and red wine. The beer's taste began with sweet ripe plums and raisins, which gave way to powdered sugar and pink bubble gum, ending with a red wine flavour which lingered for a few seconds as an aftertaste. There's very little bitterness here, but beer's sweetness is kept under control. The 9.0% alcohol is very well hidden, both in the aroma and the flavour. The mouth feel is smooth with the carbonation being much softer than previous Unibroue beer's that I've sampled...possibly as a function of being cellared? I'll have to try a fresh bottle some time for the answer to that question. Trois Pistoles is a medium bodied brew. The verdict...yet another winner from the good folks at Unibroue, and the price is not unreasonable. Looking forward to trying the remaining bottles after they have aged even more!","BuckyBeerBeaver","Jun 15, 2014"

A nice thick off-white head settles in at about half a finger and lasts well throughout the beer. The aroma is rich with spices, alcohol esters, and dark fruit sweetness. The taste is a little less explosive, but mirrors the aroma closely, spice and fruit in the forefront and a little bit of alcohol in the background. It wasn't as heavy as I expected given its big aroma and taste, but it certainly isn't lacking. This is a delicious Belgian-style dark ale.","delta490","Apr 05, 2014"

Develops a 2cm tan head, then thick clinging lacing. Te aroma is incredible--plums, figs, malt, a bit of hops. The flavor is very rich with dark roasted malt, fruit, and hops. The mouthfeel is the only part that I an not extatic about--it's a bit too foamy for me. Overall a truly outstanding ale that I am very glad to have sampled.","Dsimenson","Mar 20, 2014"

Admittedly, they are very different takes on a somewhat broadly interpretable style, but I would choose that one over this one any day of the week.

Alcohol is extremely well hidden. The carbonation scrubs at the palate leaving a lighter body than what one may expect. This drinks easily, almost like a dark cherry soda. I would argue it stands up against classic Belgian brews and even better than Rochefort 8, comparable brew.","dar482","Jan 28, 2014"

4.31,1.9,4.5,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,"12 oz. bottle from Gator Beverage in Gainesville. Pours a deep dark brownish purple with a nearly two finger creamy off white to khaki head. Big time dark fruit aroma , candy sugar, molasses, spicy Belgian yeast funk, as expected. Flavor is sweet and fruity up front with plums, cherries, pears, raisins. The finish ends with a good bit of spices that linger and play around with the sweet fruits on the tongue afterward. Medium heavy body with medium carbonation. Plenty of body but not chewy, which makes this plenty drinkable and pleasant. Nice for dessert or for anything else. Excellent BSA and there is a reason it is up there with the best of the style. Right on with all the flavors.","BMMillsy","Jan 24, 2014"

This delivers all the goods that a spiced, dark ale of this nature should have - dried, dark fruitiness, some spices, minimal sweetness, and little bit of that unique, wild Belgian yeasty character. This isn't even from Belgium and it's more enjoyable than half of the basic dark ales that come from there. I don't usually drink beers like this anymore but this is a very welcome addition to my cellar from time to time.","magictacosinus","Dec 16, 2013"

The aroma is of cocoa with some dark fruits and some roasted malt. The taste was even better than the aroma and is very complex actually. Has a light smokey finish which is nice. No harsh or bitter aftertaste and goes down too easy. With the high alcohol, after a few of these you will be buzzin' real good. LOL! A great brew overall.","BeerWithMike","Dec 05, 2013"

4.41,4.3,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"It is a Belgian Style Strong Ale that pours a dark opaque brown with aromas of Belgian yeast and dark fruits. This is a beer you have to allow to warm a bit for all of the complex flavors and aromas to completely reveal themselves. Once it warms its deep rich dark fruit and roasted malt flavors come through the Belgian yeast tones. The very smooth and mellow flavors mask the high alcohol content and make this an easily quaffable brew. The Trois Pistoles is a great example of the Unibroue quality and an excellent beer.","brurevu","Oct 16, 2013"

Smell goes a long way for me with beer, and this one didn't really draw my attention. Belgian yeast, some earth tones and hints of apple make for a decent, but lackluster nose. But man, does this taste truly wonderful! Lots of fruits up front, green apple, cherries, grapes followed by darker dates, brown sugar, and figs. Lots of Belgian yeast, and clearly has some Tripel influence. No booze whatsoever. Body is damn near perfectly fitting, perhaps could use a touch more carbonation. Overall, a wonderful drinker, but missing some of the other elements that can make a craft brew a truly all around great experience.","Samuel906","Oct 02, 2013"

4.51,6.6,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured from 750 ml corked bottle at cellar temperature. Unique murky brown color, like dark chocolate syrup mixed with root beer and some tan froth. Aroma is a deep rich blast of dark fruits, cherries, strong Unibroue yeast, dark sugar, herbs, spice. Palate is also deep and dark, dates, raisins, dried cherries, brown spices, chocolate pudding, rum, molasses, and grassy hops. Sweeter and less spicy than Maudite. Finish is semi-dry with some hops like a Belgian dubbel; some sources consider this beer to be an example of this style. Some vanilla notes reveal themselves as the dark fruits recede. Some woody flavors recall a barrel-aged spirit but not overpowering. Stands with Maudite as one of the world's finest.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 18, 2013"

Beer is dark brown with hints of red and forms a massive head, with giant soda bubbles. Yeasty, fresh aroma. Flavor combines bright Belgian ale malt flavors with rich date, sour cherry, and plum fruit flavors. Spicy up front (cinnamon, clove). Raisiny dark fruit really comes through in the aftertaste. A healthy dose of carbonation keeps the beer refreshing and prevents the beer from getting heavy on the palate. Extremely drinkable.","hreb","Jun 23, 2013"

On the nose it’s cherries, bready yeast, strong malt undertones, sticky fruit and some horse blanket. The hops are forward on the palate with a little pepper accompanied by the yeasty sweetness and the ripe fruits. The malt is good and strong like a dark beer should be but the balance is perfection. It has a medium-heavy body but it’s practically weightless on the palate and finishes off-dry with some alcohol warming. This ale has dash and a soaring spirit.

For the most part, it is very classic, but the shift toward drinkability greatly benefits the beer overall. Based on this and La Fin du Monde alone, Unibroue is most deserving of its sterling reputation. This beer is up there, though not better than, the great examples of the style, and it is certainly cheaper. If you, like me, have been waiting to pull the trigger on this or other Unibroue beers, wait no longer: you are missing out. 17.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","May 03, 2013"

This is a big strong beer with lots of flavor and great mouthfeel. However, with lots of other big strong beers to compete against now, it may lack the complexity that the best examples of this style possess. That being said, I would happily drink this as dessert six days out of seven because the sweetness really is delicious and the 355 ml bottle is easier to justify on a work night.","spoony","Apr 23, 2013"

The flavor shares an equal profile, with some plum and fig as well as a date-like sweetness standing out. What I find remarkable is how smooth (and smoothly sweet) this is. I mean, almost velvety. While not unusual I forget. (Belgian Strong Ale is not as clearly defined a category in my mind as say a dubble or triple and the wide variation is part of the reason.) This one won over some new converts recently and I can’t wait to share some more soon.","elNopalero","Jan 21, 2013"

The aroma of this ale consisted of malted grain and grassy hops. Medium in body, this Ale has a foundation of toasted malt, spicy pepper, and dark chocolate.

Brown sugar, light fruit and lots of yeasty esters make up the bulk of the aroma. The flavor is yeasty and bready with a lot of burnt and brown sugar. Light non descript fruity flavors and a touch of alcohol round out this out quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I really liked this beer.

Pours a dark mahogany with a bit of cloud. Looks very fizzy. Thin head. Smells strongly of citrus and another fruit, possibly cherry. The mouthfeel is the kicker. Very carbonated but delicate on the pallet. Perfect mouthfeel for the style. The taste is much like grapefruit and cherry with a slight anise/licorice finish. Very complex beer with a great mouthfeel. I will definitely drink this one again. Happy New Year indeed!","Jellopants356","Jan 01, 2013"

4.1,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"all unibroue beers are awesome, but this may be their finest offering. it pours a unique mahogany color, with a touch of something dark purple even in there. a nice white head stays around awhile, leaving lovely lacing down the glass. the nose of this beer is powerfully alcoholic, intemixed with a bouquet of fresh and dried fruits. plums, rasiins, candied pears, and figs come to mind, this is a rich nose. the yeast is also a classic belgian strain that really brings the smells together in a synergistic way. the flavor is equally complex and decadent, with the fruits taking center stage. its sort of sweet and thick like a port wine, but much brighter and lighter despite its full body and sticky texture. it finished boozy, and when it warms up its very intense, but this is a beer that opens up beautifully in the glass. it gets more and more yeasty to me, and less and less sweet. the mix of fruit and spice makes this a perfect winter warmer or holiday beer, although i dont think it is intended to be such. wonderful carbonation makes it more drinkable than it should be. this pairs well with red meat, boldly seasoned seafood, and caramely bread pudding. overall a world class example of the style.","StonedTrippin","Dec 24, 2012"

There are big hits of chocolate and smokey coffee, but they are complimented by a big hit of cherry and grape. It is a dessert beer that stands as a meal in itself. There is a ton of alcohol however, which shapes the beer very differently than anything I have ever had. The alcohol pairs hand in and with the deeper fruit notes creating a sweet wine finish.

4.85,14.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Overall: While described as an "Abbey Style Strong Dark Ale," it was not as strong tasting as expected. The lower alcohol warmth - especially for a 9% ABV ale - surprised me, as did the substantial fruit tastes. At times, the taste was a bit like a fortified digestif wine (say, a port or very fruity brandy) without the syrupy wine texture, but never lost it's beeriness; it also didn't have the nose-confusing, overwhelming alcohol delivery of a digestif. While not a fan of sweet beers, this is a nice blend of fruits and dark abbey ale which balances the best of both. Perhaps an all-time favorite for blending so many distinct flavors and characteristics in such a balanced way. In the end, I'd give it a 4.75 (I've yet to find a 5), but that's not an option here.","FrankyGee3","Oct 06, 2012"

The smell has some fruit, bread, grasses and maybe some other notes. Mouthfeel is delightful. A fullness of flavor with the perfect amount of carbonation. Taste is extremely well balanced. Sweet malt with some fruit notes (not overwhelming) and some toffee. The finish is smooth. Even with the high ABV, it is well hidden. It is near perfect in every way!!","Mojo","Aug 25, 2012"

All of the great things I've heard about Unibroue make more sense now that I've tried this one. It's complex and remarkably tasty. The cherry notes are my particular favorite part. Alcohol is nice and warming. Not a beer to take lightly, but a glass of Trois Pistoles every now and then is quite worthwhile.","TheRealBigC","Aug 10, 2012"

This delivers more raw spice and boozy flavors and not as much candy sweetness. The raw character creates a complex yet balanced brew. I will have to do a blind side by side tasting of these two. It's good to see that a brewery can create two ales of the same style and have both of them be great and so different. Well done! ","Hopswagger","Aug 05, 2012"

4.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall--This was my first encounter with Unibroue's stuff, and I'm hooked. It deviates from the traditional Belgian style just enough to grab your attention, but without coming off as a genre-bending Frankenbeer. This is one of those beers that you can instantly identify as having received detailed attention from the brewer. I would classify it more as a dessert beer to be enjoyed exclusively by itself, but I'm sure it would pair well with a meal due to the complexity of flavors.","jedtheavenger","Jan 18, 2012"
3.58,-15.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It poured nicely, but had a bit horse of horse blanket on top of dates and roasted malt. Taste was also a bit dank for me, but the mouthfeel was crisp and pleasant, which makes this more drinkable. It is a bit on the sweet end for me, and would not make a good session beer. A decent strong ale for the 410 four pack price, but I would not go out of my way to pick this up.","unclejazz","Jan 18, 2012"

Aromas of big raisin, molasses, fig, chocolate, caramel, tart cherry, and spicy yeast. Very nice aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big raisin, chocolate, fig, prune, molasses, caramel, tart roasted grain, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and spicy yeast on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol presence is basically non-existent for being 9%; with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is an outstanding and highly enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale.

Medium body with interestingly high carbonation released in tiny superfluous bubbles. A little distracting but true to style. Smooth as butter and overall a pretty solid brew.

3.83,-9.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured out as a deep brown color with a nice looking tan head on top. The lacing is pretty good here. The smell of dark malts and fruits blend with the Belgian yeast aromas creating a slighty sweet aroma on the nose. The taste of the beer is lightly roasted, the sweetness of the fermented fruit flavors come through and leaves a dry finish in the mouth. The mouthfeel of this brew is a little creamy and had some light carobnation making this brew an easy going sipper that can be enjoyed for a while. Overall I found this to get better as it warmed up, this is a really nice brew.","Knapp85","Sep 25, 2011"
4,-5.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer is a dark hazelnut hue, with a half inch of beige head that leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma brings malt, yeast, caramels, dark fruit. The flavor is fairly sweet, with dark fruits and yeast. Alcohol warmth emerge in the finish. Lingering notes of sweet, dark fruits soaked in alcohol. Medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. While not as delectable as the upper tier beers of this genre, Trois Pistoles is ubiquitous and enjoyable.","Huhzubendah","Sep 22, 2011"
4.32,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"On the flavor, it is a beer that I would recommend anyone try, beer lover or not, although for those who are not fond of alcohol's flavor and heat it may be prudent to chill the bottle a bit (JUST A BIT), before serving. As I just said alcohol does come through relatively quickly but not before the chocolate flavor and malt character shine through with wonderful balance. Banana esters and spice linger on the palate with a length and mouth feel, much like that of a good Bordeaux. The finish is extremely long and extremely well balanced with a nice alcohol warmth in the belly. Overall, if this beer is available try it, especially if the prices are comparable around the U.S. as my 750 ml bottle was just over $6.00 (which is a steal in my book). A beer as refreshing as returning to Beeradvocate to write a review!","linemanrt60","Sep 22, 2011"

The smell was excellent, spicy and fruity, almost a raisin smell. Reminded me of a spiced wine. Taste was surprisingly fruity, with strong fig and prune flavors. Flavor turned a bit more spicy as the bottle warmed. Mouth feel was good, not as thick as I expected though. Overall I intend to buy another bottle and store it for bit, break it out for a special occassion.","Mumps","Sep 04, 2011"

I usually like the dark Belgians, but this one just came out of left field with all the fruit flavors and complexities. I feel the spices really throw off the balance, but the taste that lingers always begs me to take another sip. Not sure what to make of it or how to compare it with other dark, high ABV Belgians I've tried. Guess I'll have to have another...","Philousa","Aug 30, 2011"

3.53,-16.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown, close to black w/ a mountainous 3 finger head, even w/ a careful pour. Decent carbonation and good lacing. Impossible to see through this beer. The nose has prune, fig, bread, and some other spice I can't quite place. Alcohol is in there as well. Not quite balanced or strong enough for the style. The taste is exactly the same as the nose. A little out of whack and weak taste for the style w/ a massive alcohol burn which shouldn't happen at 9%. Feel is very dry, sweet and on the thin side. Overall, this is a good beer, but far from world class in the style. This is a style loaded for bear w/ outstanding world class beers, and this falls short. Still, I would have this again if nothing better was in my beer fridge.","jayhawk73","Aug 22, 2011"

Caramel and deep toasted malts on the palate with more of the green grapes adding a tartness that keeps the sweetness in check. A really nice creamy carbonation that ties everything together.

Lots of carbonation bubbles visible in the bottom of my Chimay goblet. Aroma is incredibly fruity, almost like juice and hardly reminiscent of beer. The taste is sweet and also fruity. Very good actually and not what I expected. It's light bodied and lively. Overall, this drinks very nicely. Reminds me a lot of what I liked about BSDA's when I first tried them and was introduced to what belgian beer can be all about. Classic taste. It's hard to tell how much age has improved this beer since it's been at least two years since I've had its mates and I did not take notes, but I can't imagine it hurt. i don't remember liking this one as much as I do now.","Blanco","Jun 14, 2011"

It also gives you the hint that it'll have a strong alcohol flavor. The taste is of strong spiciness, alcohol and some fruity sweetness. A combination that was hot, boozy and just didn't work at all for me. The mouthfeel was medium with more carbonation than I expect from this style.

The taste brings in more of the same, along with some red apples, black grapes, raisins, figs, and rye bread. The body is an ephemerally light yet still pretty strong medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a strangely crisp finish.

3.91,-7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass, the beer is an extremely dark, almost opaque amber-brown coloring with a bubbly, biege, airy head. On the nose, you get a whiff of the carbonation from the yeast in the bottle, as well as lots of dark fruit sweetness (plums and dates), and a little booze. The beer leaves a great lace along the glass as you move it around and drink. The beer is heavy, but crisp at the same time. Malty sweet flavors, with slight hints of spice to balance. Tastes like coriander, mostly, but it's too subtle for me to be sure. The fruit sweetness is a highlight along the molasses characteristics of the malt. Very heavy and robust flavors, but the light body does well to balance all of this. The aftertaste is extremely mild, with the slightest hint of spice and malt, but only a whisper. Clean, neat finish makes this one an easy drinker.","GarthDanielson","Feb 17, 2011"

Smell is strong, mostly of Belgian malts and yeast, some dried fruit smell too. Taste is about on par with the taste, but I think I like it a little better, it's really strong, bold. Smells of dried fruit as well, figs, maybe cherries or cranberry it's tart as well. A little bready as well, would be a great deer around the holidays. Mouthfeel is pretty good, could be better. Has sort of a medium feel overall. The yeast makes it a little bigger in my opinion. Overall the drinkablility is good can easily polish off a bottle if in the mood for a Belgian.

The aroma reminded me more of a wine with a kind of fermented fruitiness mixed in with the roasted malts and light hops.

I would normally reach for a porter or stout but I think this is so much more than most of those could bring to the table. It pours a deep, cider like reddish-brown. There was a two-finger head which quickly settled, leaving only light lacing. The nose was a blend of alcohol, raisins, cherry, clove, sweet malt and a yeasty aroma I can't describe. Carbonation is heavy. The taste follows the nose perfectly with the addition of some slight bitterness to temper the sweetness - a lovely interplay that really works.

This beer has a tartness to it that I think really brings everything together and takes it to the next level of enjoyment. Body is medium with smoothness at the start and sticky dryness rounding out the finish. The tartness lingers on the palate long after one swallows, leading one to take another sip. This leads us to the drinkability, which I think is pretty damn good for this style of beer. The first beer I tried from this brewery, and still my favorite.

4,-5.4,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in a tulip. Best by 02-18-11 indicated on the bottle. Pours a hazy brownish-maroon with a one inch loose, off-white head that begins to dissipate form the center outwards. Head eventually disperses into a tight band and some swirls - some lacing, but weak legs. Nose reveals dark fruit with a hint of yeast and candi sugar - takes on a slightly vinous quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - some acidity and carbonation level makes it taste a little soda-pop like. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a fairly aggressive carbonation that weakens the body slightly and leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat. A very respectable Belgian Strong Dark. Maybe a little too much carbonation, but not gassy by any means - another solid offering from Unibroue","Jwale73","Feb 21, 2010"

There are other dark fruits like cherry and plum, but the grape dominates. You also get a hint of alcohol in the scent. Has a grape juice/wine blast at first.

The smell is good, belgian yeast, a good amount of fruits/citrus, maybe some raisins in there too.

The mouthfeel is good here too, smooth medium body with a PERFECT amount of alcohol warming on the tongue, mouth is coated with an aftertaste of raisins and dark fruits. Alcohol in this beer is great, it is used tastefully, there is presence but it does not taste chemically or over the top.

Nice rich dark cocoa, some vanilla, some sweet banana, belgian candied sugars, and clove. Really nicely done from the homies up north.

This is a medium light bodied drink, which I always love in big dark beers. The taste is particularly fruity and spicy with a sweet malty finish.

The nose is an avalanche of ginger, cumin, clove spice, spiced orange peel, caramelized brown sugar and attractive floral musk, as it normalizes in your nostrils the cherry, black raspberry scents come through, not anything here of note by way of hops. Medium-bodied, big foaminess which initially has your mouth as full as if an car safety airbag was activated in it. After that it becomes super-smooth and fluid, glides through the mouth.

Smells like Banana nut bread with some malty notes. Tastes like caramel, figs, bread, hops, and a smooth finish. This beer's alcohol content is very deceptive as it is so mellow. It's easy to drink for a high ABV beer and demands slow sipping to appreciate it's qualities. It grows on you in a quiet way. Subtle and powerful, feline in quality.

The beer had a strong yeast flavor and some hoppy fruitness that was very sour and citrusy in nature.

4.07,-3.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown with a 1/4" of light tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is quite nice although subdued, malts, fruity esters and some light phenols. Taste is like the aroma. There is a distinct caramel maltyness the supports the other flavors (and aromas). The esters are mostly of darker fruit, think dark cherries, etc. but there is also a touch of green apple that actually melded well with the other flavors here. The very light phenolic spicyness in the aroma is a bit more amplified in the flavor. There is a distinct alcohol presence in the flavor that I initially did not find in the aroma. However as I sip this brew I begin to detect some perfumes from the alcohol that are quite pleasant. I was looking for a bit more in the way of the esters here but this "style" is open to considerable interpretation. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a bit too heavy (I prefer more highly attenuated trappist versions) with medium+ body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good. This really wasn't quite what I was expecting (it seemed to lack some complexity) but I really enjoyed it none the less.","mnj21655","Oct 11, 2008"

For Unibroue, it's the aroma. Especially with Trois Pistoles, it packs a punch that reels back and hits you in the nose. To describe it as a bouquet doesn't do it justice. Spice and fruit and floral and citrus and sugars all wrapped up in one, and that's just the aroma. The taste doesn't disappoint either. Dark and rich with fruits and roasted malts, a slight burnt molasses undertone. 9% ABV but no burn at all.

Taste is huge sweet malts intertwined with the belgian yeast flare, spices ala clove, coriander, hints of caramel, those bright red dessert cherries whose name eludes me at the moment, and an alcohol bite/warming in the finish that is more noticeable on the first sip but blends in a bit more with each sip, leaving only the warming sensation in the chest.

The nose on the beer really reminds me of a dark wheat beer mixed with the ale yeast and spices; it's very complex. The taste is filled with complexity, like this style is supposed to be. It's fruity, has the usual Belgian spice to it, and a nice roasted maltness that brings out the plum flavours. This is quite tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit thin.

Tastes fruity, with a sweet taste that lingers. Very smooth and drinkable. I found myself drinking most of a 75cl bottle without realizing it. Given I'm not personally fond of red-wines, I found this beer slightly less than amazing, but for what it aspires to be, those who are looking for this sweet, edged flavour will not be disappointed. The Alcohol is deceptive, in that it doesn't seem to hit you for an hour before it rears its head all at once.

Poured into a wine glass a very dark reddish purple with a big foamy head that soon diminished. I allowed this one to warm up a little before sampling. The aroma consisted of sweet fruits perhaps grapes, cherries, and maybe even plums. Finally it was time to try a taste and the flavors burst inside of my mouth. This dark ale is very unique in that it drinks like a beer, but finishes almost like a red wine. Good carbonation and rather smooth to drink, I enjoyed sipping on this for a good while.

But that's where the fun ends. This doesn't smell like something I want to drink. It's not inviting or malty, more a sort of twisted fruitiness that I can only describe as "rotten flowers". The taste follows the smell - it's sharp and dry in a way that defies description. I was hoping for some imperial stout-like dark fruit or chocolate or something, and all I get is... I don't know.

The body is lighter than other varieties of this style, but it marries up perfectly with the spice and flavor. This is a delicious, well-balanced beverage.

It starts out sugary (candied sugar) and spicy (cloves for sure) followed by some oak, vanilla, and earthy tones, and finishes with rich bread and malt characteristics. This brew has is full bodied and very rich. Trois Pistole is something else.","Douglas14","Apr 19, 2008"

Slightly thicker-than-water mouthfeel marked by a noticeable astringency (almost a pleasant burning). Goes down smoothly. Flavors of raisin/figs/dates and malt (as in the nose) mingle on the palate with a bit of vinous acidity. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so with hints of spice (cinnamon?).

Dark currants and citric flavors like cherry give it a sour, hoppy smell although the yeat presence is strong. The first thing that hit my tongue is the malts, which seemed sweet and maybe a hint of rosting. There are traces fruits in the beer but more importantly there is caramel (it could be chocolate) in there that gives it a very smooth, almost slick driving force down your throat. There are some spices/pepper in there, natch, that give a slightly dry feel but they are not overpowering, and neither is the high ABV.

Smells sweet and malty, with dark fruits, pear, apple and orange. On the palate, it's almost candy sweet, with caramel malts and a big nuttiness. Some yeast and banana in the mix, and fruity esters taste of green apple and melon, while the hops are spicy and peppery. The medium body is tingly at the beginning, but becomes smooth by the end, lingering nicely on the palate.

I didn't notice much of a difference between this and the Maudite, except for two main instances. While the smell was similar, it wasn't as pronounced and second, the finish was a lot different. There isn't that "champagne-like" finish that you get, which I'm guessing has to do with the yeast used to ferment.

The nose is of some spice and dark malts, but mostly grainy belgian yeast. this beer has the good flavor of a belgian, but as is common with unibroue (IMO) the mouthfeel is way too thin to be convincing. You do taste the belgian yeast and dark fruit flavors in the beer, but it does not hit you like it should. Too thin in the mouth. Not sugary enough to belgian. However, it is incredibly refreshing and is dangerously drinkable. possibly one of the most refreshing "belgian styles" there is. Very thirst quenching, not afraid to take fat-ass gulps. It has that classic unibroue taste, and is very drinkable. Any beer that has that is ok in my book.","AKBelgianBeast","Dec 25, 2007"

The cap is two fingers high of a delicate light-brown that descends slowly and leaves large, lingering lacing. The aroma is quite mellow and pleasant. Lots of yeasty breadiness with delicate notes of citrus, light fruits and a perfectly faint hint of alcohol. The taste is perfectly balanced, delicate, mellow. A harmonious blend of bready sweet and light citrus flavors, very little alcohol presence. The same characteristics linger on seemingly forever (and wonderfully) in the aftertaste. Medium and with enough carbonation to add a lightness. Trois Pistoles is a dangerously drinkable offering. It holds up to the bottle's claim of being "remarkably mellow" and is delicate and perfectly balanced. I am most impressed at how perfectly the alcohol is presented, hidden enough to be incredibly drinkable, yet present in both aroma and mouth just enough to let drinker know Trois Pistoles is a serious, sophisticated drink to be sipped and enjoyed.","BiereBlanche","Dec 16, 2007"

Tastes similar to smell, with some bananas, and lots of over-ripened fruits (raisins or prunes), maybe some fig flavors and a nice alcohol warmth in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium viscocity and mouthcoating, but as it moves back, a nice carbonated fizziness is felt on the tongue. Very pleasant indeed. Overall this is another excellent beer from Unibroue.

It almost has a cola mixed with red wine flavor, not awful like it sounds. The feel is kind of light and very fizzy. The carbonation probably takes away from the taste a bit.

Tastes is of some fruits, some alcohol, and some chocolate. A very complex drink. High carbonation leaves a slightly creamy feel and a distinct after-taste.

The smell is aggressive and interesting. There is a dark fruit base that is seriously 'kicked up' with something else. All i can associate it with right now is bubblegum which i know doesn't sound flattering, but it complements the flavor. Medium bodied, the tiny bubbles lend a silky creaminess to the entire experience. There are caramel notes in the nose and in the flavor as well. It finishes very clean.

It was a fruity scent put i couldn't place, but it tickled my nostrals. I poured it into a pint glass and to my surprise it had a color close to Guinness, but not to dark as to not light a little light through. It had a nice head to it, not to frizzy. When i took a sip, i know i was in for a pleasure. It had a taste that words can't do justice. It had at first the taste of your average Canadian beer, but the after taste was a fruity and enjoyable. It went down quickly and before I knew it i drank the 24 oz bottle in the matter of minutes. I had a good buzz for a while. I highly suggest it you try it for the first time, don't read the bottle.

The beer looked very dark in the bottle. As I poured it, the color was coffee brown. There was a big active head at first, but it quickly faded down to almost nothing. Aroma was strong, alcoholic, fruity, and a little bit spicy. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth. Flavor was malty, fruity, and maybe just a little bit smokey. With some sips I got a slight solvent flavor in the aftertaste; I didn't like that so much. The first time I tried this beer, I found it overpowering; I am happy to have enjoyed it this time. It paired very nicely with the barbecue beef I was eating and held up against the strong flavor of the food. It also served nicely as a dessert afterward.","PhiloPsych","Apr 27, 2007"

4.37,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"A careful pour, my goblet only holds 12oz, reveals a deep mahogany brown to black beer with medium clarity and a thin layer of tight bubbles on top. The smell is of sweet dark fruits raisins and plums with a touch of an oaky and peppery character along with a slight cloviness and earthy smells from the yeast. In the taste the sweet dark fruit comes through up front along with a decent alcohol flavor and port wine like complexity and warmth. There is a bit of earthy grassy flavors in the taste as well that could possibly be attributed to the yeast, I'm not sure about that though. The mouthfeel is spot on, this beer is very full but has enough carbonation to keep it active on the tongue. The beer finishes very dry with a good deal of pepper and alcoholic spice. A sipping beer but yet dangerously drinkable, it has highly complex flavors but no single flavor or aspect of this beer comes through to overwhelm the senses and make it difficult to drink. I would like to see how this changes after some time in the cellar.","fank2788","Apr 18, 2007"

Taste is mildly fruity but very yeasty, especially if you pour some of the "lees" in with it. Very mild combination and an excellent moderate mouthfeel make this an incredibly drinkable beer.

4.6,8.7,4,4,5,5,4.5,"Pours very dark, pretty much black, with only the slightest russet highlights poking through at the edges. Initially the head is thick and off-white, but it fades quickly and leaves little lacing. Aroma is thick with spices and fruits: coriander, anise, maybe some cardamom(?), dried dates. On the palate, a sharp, lightly sweet blast of fruits hits first off, along with a blast of juicy carbonation. Sweet, smooth malts kick up at the mid-palate, then the spices come out before things dry out a bit toward the finish. A final flash of fruit crops up at the very end, then there's a long, dry, buzzy finish that lasts for 30 seconds or so. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with big carbonation -- it's pleasingly un-syrupy and un-chewy. Overall, this is a fabulous strong dark ale -- one of the best, in my opinion. Great spicing, very good fruit character, and that wonderful Belgian sweet-but-dry character. Wonderful.","geexploitation","Mar 19, 2007"

Even a short-lived wispy cloud eminates from the bottle...very spooky. Poured this into my Duvel tulip glass. The appearance was deep burgandy; a suprising level of carbonation in the head which is not viscous and disappears shortly after your first few sips. The aroma is fruity from raisens, plumbs, dried apricots. Licorice too. Undertones of dates, raisens in the initial taste with carbonation in the finish...not a bad thing but unexpected.

Flavors were simply explosive in the mouth and were sweet malts, caramel, citrus like touches of oranges and grapefruits, grapes, tantalizing spices, berries and chocolate.

All of the Unibroue selections that I have tasted make me think of hefeweizen to some extent and this one is no exception. Normally I say that with a thumb downturned, a nose upturned(as if!) and no glory whatsoever but not this time. Not my favorite type of beer but this is quality like all of their brews are. There's a bockish caramel-wort taste and a little licorice? Root? Something with a black hand grabbing the tongue and stretching it to places unknown. There are minor flotilla which seem to be little more than garnish, but hell maybe they are giving off all the taste. Anyway lots of leafy and minty essence here. Almost like an icy hot peppermint stick with a candy bar rhythm jumping through a mist of alcohol sprinkler and sliding all the way to the edges of the boneyard invigorating even the dead.","thelagerheads","Nov 05, 2006"

Extraordinarily effervescent, I'm caught by surprise as the head erupts out of the bottle and all over me and the chair I'm sitting in. In the glass, the head is a light tan, and builds to a quite substantial hight before settling in, thick and fluffy. Smell is sickly sweet, with loads of grapes and berries, along with yeast and spices. Taste is better balanced, with the grapes and plum still playing a prominent role, but supplemented with vinous notes and a spicy alcohol bite. Finish lasts well, dry and woody, thanks to the spectacular mouthfeel. Clinging and thick, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, a nice brew to savour and appreciate.

The bubbles aren't the microscopic, persistent ones of some of the trappists and the dissappearing head is probably the beer's achiles heel. Beyond that, though, very few complaints. Smell is sweet, with notes of bananas and...figs? Taste is fruity, then notes of chocolate, with a warming alcohol finish and those figs again. Very smooth, satisfying mouthfeel, really lets you know you're drinking a beer without making you feel you have to chew it. Drinkability is excellent, I could sip these all night. Sip.

The taste was of course very Belgian, yeasty and bready, but very sweet as well. You can tell it's a toasted malt, but the malt is not really a bitter toast, it stays very sweet and fruity, I really like the hint of rasberry I got in the finish. The mouthfeel is very light, sweet tingle, much like a wine. This beer is so very drinkable, the bottle went down easy and fast.

It's not as "thick" as I expected it to be, but I could definitely feel the carbonation while I was drinking it. Even with the carbonation, it was very easy to drink. It tasted pretty much like it smelled, nice and fruity but not very strong at all, at least not as strong as I expected a 9% ABV beer to be. There's a fruity aftertaste to the beer too, but it doesn't last too long. I really couldn't feel the alcohol in it when I started drinking it, but it kicked in closer to when I finished drinking it.

Initially the warming alcohol was dominate in the finish but towards the end of the bottle it was not noticeable. Mouthfeel had the classic Unibroue feel to it. There is almost a champagne like feel but it is more velvety smooth than champagne. Overall drinkability is that at 9% it packs a punch which makes this a one at a time brew for me.

Attractive dark, hazy brown with a small, creamy, off-white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Wonderful wine-like aromas and flavors, dark fruit, berries, oak, spice, and warming alcohol that kicks up a little on the finish.

The spice ties things together and there's a solid malt backbone there as well. Fruits and alcohol waft in and out throughout, each character there for an instant before making way for the next. Hints of tartness and malt peek through. Sweet, spicy finish that's just off-dry, and there's a hint of lemongrass here as well. Medium bodied yet quite airy - the beer almost seems to disappear on the palate due to the full, well-integrated carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden, but shows itself in a delicate warmth.

I get some dark fruit notes like dates, raisins, and a little bit of plum, yeasty esters, alcohol flavors, and big doughy malts. Mouthfeel is slighly thick, a tiny bit astringent, and sadly, there is even some undesirable alcohol burn to the throat. The alcohol could be masked a bit better.

Full bodied, leaves a nice alcohol warming sensation. Full flavored, yet still refreshing with a long smooth finish.

The color is a brilliant deep brown with amber hues. The head is fairly thin but lasting. Lacing is decent. Carbonation is exceptionally aggressive. Texture is meaty like a rib eye.

4.12,-2.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Trois Pistoles has always been my favourite of the Unibroue labels; a true work of art, and somehow nothing less would do for this beer. Classy, elegant, with an almost sacred air surrounding these bottles of Trois Pistoles. In the glass TP is a very dark, almost deep purple colour. Held to a light it is dark brown. It looks thick and inpenetrable, appearing black from a distance. The head is light beige and brown, leaving large bubbles of lace. The head from this particular bottle was not that large, and actually I have found the head a little inconsistent for TP, but this is still a magnificent looking beer. The aroma is musty and exceptionally complex. From above the rim I can detect some maltiness mixed with charcoal and black licorice. In closer is where all the fruitiness exists, and the detectable but not overpowering phenols. Red grapes, grapejuice, black currants, figs, dark malts and alcohol, baking bread, and a great balance of sweetness; a sugariness that is always there, but very subtle and a little hard to coax out of it. The website mentions aromas of chocolate, but I get very little, if any chocolate smells. Similar yeast aromas to the other Unibroues. I get red apples and faint pear aromas as well. Swirling the glass releases some saltiness, like a seasoning. The aroma is also quite spicy if you sniff close enough, and that combined with the 9% really can tickle the nose, and numb it. As it warmed I started to smell soil in the aroma. Taste at first is dusty sweetness of dark malt. Again I get a lot of grape taste up front, more fruits, horehound candy, and mollasses. The alcohol makes it presence known fairly rapidly, and it definitely lingers in the aftertaste. The finish also gives some cream and iron metallic tastes. The taste to me is much like a fortified grapejuice, but not exactly wine-like, because it is too sweet. There are definitely some cabernet or merlot flavours though, along with a little bitterness akin to tannins. And I do mean little: even for the style this possesses very little dryness. Full bodied and warming. Despite the volume of alcohol, very drinkable and absolutely stunning as an after dinner drink with a rich, sweet dessert. A beer that lives up to its label. This is a brew I love to introduce to people as one of Canada's best craft beers.","Cwrw","Jun 21, 2005"

Further inspection reveals the hue to be closer to a very dark brownish garnet. Powerful estery aroma of blended tropical and dark fruits, a zing of citrous hops, and a little bready malt. Slight wine-like character to the nose. Taste is an interesting blend of dark and light malts, slight breadiness and yeastiness. Nice dark fruits and berries in the flavor, think red wine with lots of malt. The more this beer warms, the more wine-like qualities come out - very tasty. Zesty hops tantalize the tongue with orange peels and lemons. Hops come in big and bold, but aren't able to dominate the huge malt bill. The hops relinquish their hold on your palate; the flavor moving back to huge creamy malt with a little bread and some alcohol. Finish is has some chewy malt, and is slightly acidic, but is mostly dry and vinous. Wickedly drinkably and devilishly delicious.","BeerFink","May 02, 2005"

Mildly caramel and dark fruit sweetness remained mellow without throwing their respective weights about. The well administered spice character showed up in the latter stages of the flavor revelation. Very nicely crafted. The taste showed itself and departed without lingering or pestering. The lack of aftertaste prompted rapid sipping in an attempt to keep the flavor constantly atop the tastebuds.

If you tilt the glass you can see tiny bubbles steadily streaming upwards, adding to it's head, and helping with its retention. Lacing about the glass, however, is a bit more limited than might be expected given the head retention. In the nose dark fruits greet you (not unlike port wine in many ways). It's initially zesty in the mouth before it warms a bit, but it still leaves with a bit of a zing until it warms a bit and becomes more airy. The flavor is drenched in soft, tanninc dark fruit that's been dipped in liquid sugar; but it's not particularily complex. As it warms, however, more caramel notes and some subtle hops become apparent, as does a touch of spicy alcohol (and some actual spice perhaps?) and some very low-key notes of licorice or soft molasses. It's really well balanced, with it's spicy alcohol and delicate bitterness balancing the dark fruits and restrained sugars. It's really quite enticing in that it's flavors are somewhat restrained and "mellow" as the back label suggests. This is a beer to be savored slowly, enjoying it's subtle complexities as they emerge.

A blendy of dark fruits, mainly subdued raisin and plums. The immediate aftertaste is very crisp. The aftertaste doesn't last long though, I'd like it to stick around a bit to savor the flavor, but I'm sure this is due to the high ABV of this beer. Even with the 9% content this brew goes down nice and smooth. Perfect for sitting around one cool evening to savor the flavor and be warmed up a bit.","blitz134","Nov 16, 2004"

Dark, sweet, raisin and cherry fruit and alcohol aromas. Rich, roasted malt and dark fruits in the mouth with an excellent, slightly bitter and very dry finish that leaves you wanting more.

The aroma I could inhale all day: Molasses, figs, raisins, clove, chocolate, cinammon. It almost shares an aroma profile with a dopplebock, or dare I say an eisbock. The taste reveals a very vinous quality, but like a good sherry or port. The palate is inundated with chocolate and molasses and raisins, just a beautiful sensation that I want to envelop me. Really, this is like liquid chocolate-covered raisins. There is a slight roasty aftertaste that brings just enough bitterness to the table to keep this from being cloying. The mouthfeel is stout and the carbonation is just wonderful if not a bit filling, coating every corner of the tongue. The drinkability is exceptional as the alcohol content is well-masked.

Roasted malts, yeast, various spices (I discerned some cinnamon, ginger and cardamum), and a currant-like fruitiness are evident in the nose. Roasted candi sugar and malts are upfront, followed by a grape/currant-like fruitiness and backed with a healthy dosage of yeastiness and hops to keep it dry and palatable in the finish. Not bad; I'd like to try it in the 75 cl presentation. The alcohol is noticable, but barely. A slight bit of burnt cideriness at the end of the goblet.","crookedhalo","Sep 23, 2004"

Aromas of brown sugar, dark fruit (plums and apples?, I can't figure it out) and a bit of yeasty goodness. Dark fruits, raisins and plums, some cocoa, dark candied sugar, and possibly some other stuff. There's a bit going on in there and it's hard to seperate out. Finish is smooth and lingers for a while drawing you back for more. Moderate bodied beer is smooth on the tongue.

Big, two finger head that's thick and strong. Lace sticks to the glass like post-it notes. Big smell of cherries, alcohol, chocolate, plums, raisins, malts and dark chocolate. Taste is a bit more subdued. The above ingredients make a thick sweetness that is balanced by, of all things, the alcohol. Instead of hops for balancing the sweet, this beer relies on the kick of the alcohol. It works well. Mouthfeel is dry and has an oatmeal thickness that's a bit unexpected in anything liquid. Good drinkability. Would be nice on a winter afternoon, sipped like brandy.","slitherySOB","Sep 19, 2004"

The presence of alcohol is certainly detectable, but not overpowering. A little bit of spice and malt. Very pleasant; I couldn't wait to have a sip. The taste, too, has some spice to it and plenty of malt. There is no question that this is a higher gravity brew. Certainly not unpleasant, but there is indeed a warming affect from the 9.0%abv. Would be absolutely ideal for a cold winter night. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and it goes down easily.

3.75,-11.3,4.5,4.5,4,2,3,"Very dark ruby, almost brown. Pours with a delicate head of foam that leaves some nice lacework as it falls. The delightful aroma is full of plum and fig with a hint of smoke. A bit uneventful up front and not very complex, quite thin in body and overly carbonated (reflected in low points for drinkability and mouthfeel.) Hints of tobacco are hidden behind the sharp, prickly carbonation. The finish is powerful, laced with sugar and rum-like flavors, bit of tobacco and smoke, quite complex. There's some interesting stuff going on in this beer. Unfortunately, most Unibroue beers are way too spritzy for my tastes; I usually have to decant them a couple of times into a pint glass to release a lot of the carbonation, which vastly imporoves my ability to enoy this beer. My wife used to go to Key West each year and was astonished to find Unibroue beers at the corner liquor store by her motel. She has a theory that the champagne-like carbonation of the Unibroue beers makes them more appealing to drinkers in tropical climates.","marcobrau","Aug 12, 2004"

The beer pours out dark brown, like used motor oil, but leaves a nice but short lived head. Verry little lacing to speak of, but lots of carbonation and light fizz. Smell is fruity, fresh and floral. Taste is nothing short of remarkable. It is sweet and just slightly tangy, light on the palate and smooth. I taste some strawberry in there, some ripe plums and maybe some mulberry. The bottle says that there is "a pleasant aftertaste that lingers on like old port wine". It does leave a nice aftertaste, but it is smoother than any port wine I have ever had.

This is fairly light bodied given the intense fruit aromas that are in the aroma. The alcohol is evident in the light burn as it reaches my stomach. There is a hint of coriander in the finish. The fruit notes of raisin and fig are here in the taste as well, but they are not as intense as the aroma would suggest. The finish is fairly dry, though it is lightly sweet up front, which helps to accentuate the fruit notes. Definitely an elegant brew, pretty subtle and I can imagine that some age brings some added complexity to this brew. I'll have to stash a few to see how they age.","Gueuzedude","May 16, 2004"

Small lace remains throughout. Large sediment chunks in the very bottom, even with a slow pour. A rich malt smell rises and then wet leaves and carmel notes dominate. The standard fruity-alcohol flavors are there also, with cherries and fresh plums. Taste is very smooth with an interesting hop bite in the aftertaste. Again, uber-chewy malt gives this a heavy sweetness, but there is just enough balance to pull it through. Very much like Celebrator, with some New World kick to it.

It poured dark brown but in a Duvel tulip it was nearly black, and glowed a hazy reddish-orange-brown with backlighting. It was topped with a beautiful creamy off-white head that left very nice lacing. The fantastic nose was beaming with fruity esters, dominantly cherries, dipped in fine chocolate. Other esters were noticable just outside of the spotlight, such as cantolope and coconut. A tad of alcohol was present from time to time. The taste closely reflected the nose, but was much more complex. Again, the dominant sensation was one of sweet, dark cherries and chocolate, but this time, a whole world of other fruits/flavors danced over the palate. I imagined notes of cola, melon, pear, apple, banana, and bready yeast. All of this was presented with an active bite from the start, which contributed significantly in launching the flavor score to "exceptional". This wonderful world of flavor was followed by a sensation of warming in the throat and lingering flavors of sasparilla, cola, chocolate, and cherry. The body was fluffy, very smooth, and full.

Perhaps I had a leaky bottle but the carbonation is just not showing itself. Smells weakly candy like with some sugars and nutmeg coming through. The taste is rather flat off the top with a real nice ramp up to the spices and brownie like texture. Carbonation is a little more present on the palate. Extremely easy on the tounge with a real smoth mouthfeel. Slightly sweet and very dry. Definitely a sipping beer.","yankeeheel","Feb 05, 2004"
4.22,-0.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours out with a huge, bone-white head of small, dense bubbles that quickly fizzes out like a soft drink. Bah! (Disclaimer: I have had samples that look much better, easily worth a rating of "4.") Threre's a bit of oozy cling to the liquid itself. Color of beer is near-opaque ebony; just a little bit of light comes through at the sides. Aroma is sweet from across the room; up in the nose it suggests fresh, sugary plums and black cherries; baking spices (mostly nutmeg?); and a strong, persistent yeast backbone that is somehow not bready. It's like they took my mom's black forest cherry cake and turned it into a beer. Despite the imposing appearance, nosefeel is delicate, cool, and expansive. Sweet taste (again, fresh! plums and black/sour cherries) would border on cola but a zap of spice (cinnamon especially, but also clove/nutmeg) levels it out, getting quite spicy in midpalate. The label suggests "port wine," okay, I can see that; there's a continually developing tannic/dusty grapeyness to it. A combination of fresh fruit "plumpness" and dry fruit sweetness... Bold carbonation in a near-fudgy mouthfeel dries out to a very full, dry, powdered-chalky finish that takes its time moseying away. No alcohol detectable at any point, even at 9 abv. Superb as a digestif and bordering on decadent. Mm.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Feb 05, 2004"

Like the image on the label, this beer is dark and broody with more than a few surprises up its sleeve (like the unnoticably high 9.0% abv). From its black body arises the aroma of fruit, like unripened pears. On the tongue, it feels at once crisp and dry as well as mellow. No hops are needed for this to stand tall like the Three Towers of its name. Very drinkable, but probably not recommended for long sessions, unless you've got the liver for it.","JamesBerry","Jan 27, 2004"

Deep and complex sweetness in the taste. There's a touch a smoky caramel malt, sweet spices, fruits and licorice. Very nice. Alcohol is well hidden behind all of the strong flavors.

Now I am able to pick up more of the subtleties and this offering has some great subtleties. Appearance was like dark cherries witha beautifully carbonated head that remained, though somewhat diminished down the glass. Smell..mmmm..cherry-like IMHO, alcohol undertones, with some yeasty elements... a great blend. Taste was equally complex...fruity, alcohol, yeast, wine-like elements. Mouthfeel...medium with a beautiful astringency at the finish. For the abv (9.0) very drinkable.","edchicma","Jan 13, 2004"
3.88,-8.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Served from a 750ml bottle. Pours a dark mahogany with a decent head that disspates fairly quickly. Smell is of fruit, a little sweetness and some alcohol. There was a lot of carbonation to this bottle. I've read other people saying theirs was undercarbonated. Not this one. If anything, it got much better as the carbonation mellowed out. Flavor is of ripe fruit, spicy, a little bit of chocolate and rich malt. Just a little hops and an amazingly dry finish. There was also a little alcohol present in the taste. All in all this is a very good beer, but I think it still has a little ways to go before I'd put it up there with strong ales such as St. Bernardus Abt 12. There's nothing that I dislike about this beer... however, it didn't knock my socks off either.","ChrisBowers","Jan 10, 2004"

4.33,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep brownish-red hue, dense and murky with minimal light penetration, the beige head reached a good two fingers in height. The retention was excellent; the pack of bubbles lasted the entire quaff. Unorganized sheets of lace doted the side of my glass. The aromatics on the nose were impressive and deceiving. The bouquet was surprisingly light and airy with pleasant whiffs of pepper, traces of marshmallows, bready-yeastiness and yeasty fruitiness too. Plus there is an excellent hint of chocolate malts. While the potency is modest it is inviting and complex. The palate is light, with subtle fruitiness upfront, apples mainly, a kiss of marshmallow that is engulfed by the pepperiness and then lightly roasted, chocolate malts of the middle and finish. In the end the maltiness is pleasantly secondary, as hints of dates, raisins, and horse blanket shine more. The aftertaste is unearthly with apples, pepper, fruitiness, and maltiness, somewhat dry. A stunningly well crafted beverage, devilish really, the 9% abv is absent on the palate. I did, however, notice the beer on the brain. Warming. The body is medium; excellent levels of carbonation it is just firm enough. Wow, the ease of consuming this ale is scary, considering it is an extremely complex brew. If, for some odd reason youve failed to try this beer, you must. Trois Pistoles is simply lovely. Unibroue has sold me on their greatness. I scored this 750 ml in Kansas City.

An aroma of fruit greets the drinker with a smell of grapes and cherries, perhaps even a bit of raisin and plum. The spicy, fruity flavors are just as complex with a strong sense of vinous quality. A bit of spice and cloves carries through as well. The medium body is lasting and gives a bit of strong aftertaste, almost syrupy in its finish.

What the dark ale on lees is going on around here? In reality it is more of a dark reddish-brown than red, and one can see through it as well. It pours quite a creamy-whitish head and the aromas that dance off of this one are quite crazy. This definitely well hopped but with a spice kick of some variety. Perhaps bitter orange peel, coriander, pepper, or even ginger? I couldn't quite place it. This is truly a very unique beer that falls within the belgian variety.

Aromatics were fruit driven and complex-melon,sour cherries, botrytis-where's the blue cheese? Medium in body with soft bitter chocolate and light buttery fruitiness. A faint peach and tangy raisin note adds to the finish of this very, very complex and intriguing brew. This is a more wine like offering where the malt plays a second to the fruit. I'm thinking pear and blue cheese-seared foie gras?...incidently, my notes say "...end of the 9th..Cubs down 9-6...I need four pistoles!! all I can do to keep from throwing this glass to the floor....we got Wrigley?!"

Nose contains cherries, caramel, spices, mild herbal tones. Flavour is immediately that of sweet malt, sour cherry, some citrus, a bit grassy, a bit woody, then on to a spicy finish, some floral hops, and a boozy sherry-like aftertaste (to be expected with the 9% abv). The flavour then comes back again with a caramel/toffee taste that lingers in the mouth long after it's been swallowed. This ale is utterly remarkable, only the second time I have ever tried it.

With cinnamon I'd expect a dessert but this beer is firstly a steak beer (trust me here.... I've been drinking it for years) and then with aged goat cheese....it's a pairing to revisit.

The table had a sticky feel the next morning. It tasted malty-sweet, slightly like cherries, or even cherry flavored cough syrup.

The head that was produced wad thick, rich, dense and lasting, and was tan in color. As far as lace, it started from the top of the glass and lasted until the last sip. The aromas that came from my glass (sniffing outside in the fresh air) were as follows  dark malts, caramel, dark fruits (black cherries), alcohol (slight), baked apples, spices (black and red peppercorns), grass and a hint of yeast. Very complex. The tastes that I experienced were of dark malts, cherry wood oak barrel that might have been used to age, alcohol (slight), citrus, dark fruits (dark cherries), melted brown sugar, baked apples, ground black pepper, and a deep port wine to finish. This beer was far more complex then I would have believed. It was thick, creamy and chewy all at once. Amazing how Unibroue hides all that alcohol behind all those complex flavors.

The Unibroue is perhaps a bit spicier, the Chimay slightly smoother. Trois pistoles pours the usual magnificent head, with good retention. Very dark, looks almost identical to the Chimay. Has a quenching, yet substantial taste. As is the case with the other Unibroue offerings, almost a wheat-beer like refreshing quality, but is complex and packs a quite a punch. No alcohol noted in the taste, but certainly in the effect. With all of the varieties, I could drink Unibroue almost every night (if not for the fear of overwhelming my liver, I probably would!). This can't compare to Rochefort or Westy, but for the price and availability, you can't really go wrong. Make sure to let this warm up.

Not like a champange though. Body is roughly medium. Flavor profile is subtle yet complex. Sweet malts, biscuit and a bit of bitter hops are detected. There's a unique mustiness present that throws me into a big Deja Vu. Flavor's also a little medicinal and phenolic, a little yeasty and quite fruity.

Nevertheless, this beer is quite beautiful when presented in its signature glass. The aroma doesn't fall short of this either. Sharp and spicy with dark fruits such as plums and currants. Very reminiscent of a great dubbel. A strong caramel sweetness is present in the background, holding everything up. On the palate, it's again in the range of a dubbel. Initially it's very smooth and caramelly sweet, then in the middle the huge spice and fruit characters really kick in. The fruitiness is currant and plum again, with some grape in there as well. A sharp hop twang backs all of it up, pairing perfectly with the spice and currant. In the back, the fruitiness gets kind of rind-like, like plum skin. Finishes with a smack of spice and hops and a bit more sweetness. Malty smoothness throughout. Just a touch of pepper here and there. Some leafy hop character in the aftertaste, along with some other things that are hard to pull out of the flavor when it's actually in your mouth, making for a very pleasant aftertaste. A wonderful dubbel overall. That's what I'd call it, it fits that description more than dark strong ale, in my opinion. Very much a warming brew. I think some aging would smooth this out in a good way. I wish I had a cellar or a nice cool closet that stayed that way year-round.

She quickly reminded me that I said that after La Fin Du Monde, Maudite, etc. Pours a dark brown with a big foamy head that lasts, and laces well. Slight aroma of fruits, maybe bigger, but I have a slight cold. Wonderful dark fruit taste and smooth mouthfeel. Silky going down. Clean finish with hints of pepper and spices to go with the fruits. Just a great Belgian Dark. Big alcohol prevents me from having more than 3 or 4 or.....","HopheadEd","Dec 27, 2002"

I notice a bit of everything in the nose from vanilla, to fruit, and malt, and hops, raisins. The taste is much more simple yet great. It is sweet with a thin malt slap, followed by some alcohol kick - which is a good kick. Great finish, smooth and easy. This is a great beer, my favorite so far from Unibroue.","doho95fu","Dec 21, 2002"

I consider myself to have a wide range of tastes and I'm very open minded of beer like all of you advocates out there. I even went out and bought a goblet that is appropriate for this style of beer. Dark brown color was nice and different, however I was very surprised by the lack of lacing. Taste was full of yeast, fruit and I think clove. Carbonation a bit more than I am used to. A good beer for sipping on a cold night and maybe I'll like Belgians more someday but for now I'll try the one I still have in the fridge (Piraat) and If that dosen't do it for me, see ya.","Mark","Dec 09, 2002"
3.07,-27.4,4,4.5,2.5,3.5,2,"With me being a big fan on Unibroue, i really wanted to try this beer. I was happy to see when i was pouring a nice dark ale, or what i thought. I smelled some yeast, so i was really geared up to drink this. It took about 15 mins to pour the bottle with letting the head to settle down,but when i took my first sip, all i tasted was fruit, which made it somewhat hard for me to drink, since i am not that big on fruity beers. Very strong peppery flavour. I only sampled one of these 750ml corked bottles, right when i was starting to try belgian-style brews. I will try this again, and possibly re-do the entire review. But for the people who love fruit beers, grab this one right away.","CreamAle128","Dec 07, 2002"

4.18,-1.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,5,"Formidably thick, creamy, and stiff beige head akin to chocolate dusted egg whites beat to a soft peak. Hazy garnet hue. Sweet lemony citrus and perfume like sweetness upfront in aroma w/ a hint of fragrant pine. Pleasantly mild green apple acetaldehyde is secondary. Hints of raisin and trace chocolate emerge as the beer breathes. Trace phenol in aroma. Date like fruity fructose sweetness is perceptible at first, then is supplemented by lightly raisiny, dark caramel sweetness. The initially sugary fruitiness widens into a ripe, prune nature that melds well with the understated chocolate character. Clean in terms of yeast byproucts, with only a trace of clove present in flavor. Light in body and correspondingly light, but certainly not weak, in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is appropriately light, and only barely offsets malt sweetness. Finishes clean, w/ sweetness briefly lingering on the tip of the tongue. Although Trois Pistoles is not the most complex example of the style, its overall soft, pleasantly sweet character lend it unparalleled drinkability. Superbly masked alcohol content. Highly enjoyable. This was a 12 ounce bottle. ...Perhaps one of the finest beers with a twist off cap. I look forward to eventually trying a well cellared 750 ml bottle.","marc77","Nov 20, 2002"

I poured one of them out because I thought they were skunked.  This beer tastes similar but way better.  I'm not sure if these beers I've been getting are skunked, or is it's that I'm just not used to the flavor of Belgian beers.  Do they all have a certain sourish medicinal quality to them? Help me out here someone.  Anyway, this stuff is pretty carbonated and has the malty characteristics of a stout except this beer is not very heavy at all.  It is quite drinkable and has a decent ABV that will sneak up on you.  I've had better beers but it's still pretty good.","HossMcGraw","Nov 14, 2002"

Notes of yeast and spices are present in the nose. Taste varies from sweet to tart, acidic to spicy. Notes of fruit, yeast, spicy hops and alcohol present themselves nicely.

The aroma is very complex, with yeast, fruits, and other scents.  Reminds me of a ggod red wine.  The taste is sweet, fruity and slightly overpowering.  I did not find it to be as well balanced as some of the other Unibroue offerings.  The mouthfeel is good, but the alcohol is a little too prevalent, creating too much astringency on the finish.    Not many people could have more than a couple of these in an evening.  Another nice beer from Unibroue that I must purchase again.","aaronh","Oct 17, 2002"
