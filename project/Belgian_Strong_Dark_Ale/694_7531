Syrupy sweet, and alcoholic.  A bit overpowering, and a challenge to drink.  I'm not looking for a beer to challenge me very often.  I don't think I'll look for again.

Strong Beer's and Ales~this is not a Beer you knock back with your buddies while watching the Game or playing Poker,this is a Top Notch [IMHO]  World Class Brew,it is a Beer you Savor and take your time to enjoy it's Amazing Flavors and the brewer's Art,what a BEER!

But got one in my stocking for Christmas so here we go.  Poured a clear red with some carbonation and very little head.  Some lacing but it would slide down the glass.  Decent smell with the dark fruit and cherry but the alcohol overwhelms it, smelled a little like alcohol soaked cherries.  Taste is similar,  you pick up the cherry and malt but again it is overwhelmed by the alcohol, just kind of off.  They made it strong but not very balanced.  It gets easier to drink as I went along but was still not what I would call enjoyable.  Some lip licking from the malt which was good.  The beer is almost thin, certainly not the rich texture I enjoy in the style.  Overall, average at best.  Beer guru was right yet again.","JamieDuncan","Jan 04, 2015"

The aromas and flavors are subtle, and I think this is not a good representation of what a Belgian Strong Dark Ale truly is. It seems a bit too "mild" for the style if that even makes sense. The one thing I must say is that the alcohol is masked extremely well for 11% ABV. So much so that If you told me it was 11% without me seeing proof, I wouldn't believe you. I would drink this beer again if it was free, but I most likely won't buy it again.","TheItalianStallion","Dec 26, 2014"

At first, I didn't think I was going to finish my draft, but it slowly grew on me.  Again, not my preference, but I can see why people might enjoy this.  I kept thinking this might be good warmed.

Well, that didn't happen, and Mad Elf was a lot milder than I expected, but I will tell you, it definitely tastes like medicine.  The cherry and the alcohol both hit your tongue right away.  Even the dark cherry color reminds me of something medicinal.  There is a definite cough-syrupy finish that I wouldn't say I hate, but it didn't do me any favors either.  Overall, this is an acceptable brew in small quantities.  I wouldn't want to drink too much of it, and I definitely wouldn't want it all the time.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Dec 04, 2014"

Aromas of very rich, sugary fruit notes of cherry, fig, date, as well as notes of bubble gum, cotton candy, a blend of nutmeg and cinnamon spice, rich honey, tangy caramel,  and woody notes. There's an overall roast character dancing around in there, too. Flavors are rich and sweet forward, with an undertone of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Sweet flavors are caramel, an old-world fruit blend, cherry tart and sweet, rich honey, and earthy notes. There is a subtle booze warmth that builds as you drink. Solid. The beer is slick and light in mouth, despite all the heavy palate notes. There is a tangy fruit sweetness in the aftertaste, with some of the booze lingering around. The finish is slick, slightly oily, with a decent fruit and booze linger. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 22, 2014"

It has a slightly lighter mouthfeel than what is experienced traditionally, so if you find standard BSDA's to be too thick this might be right up your alley. For me it is a bit too light. It has a decent amount of flavor to keep me interested and enjoying the beer. I am disappointed in the distinct lack of honey and cherry flavor. For a BSDA it's a good beer but for a spiced holiday ale it lacks what people crave in a holiday beer. Drinking this early (at the end of October) with no presence of the advertised flavors, I can only imagine how it will taste in two months...","teromous","Oct 28, 2014"

It's simple and unassuming, but is having to fight an uphill battle against my expectations for the style. Just a bit more depth of flavor--maybe some bitterness to counter the sweetness, or some flavor profiles beyond the sweet would be helpful.","LambicPentameter","Jun 09, 2014"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/18/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, fig, light banana, honey, caramel, toast, candi sugar, bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, light clove, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, apple, light banana, honey, caramel, toast, light chocolate, candi sugar, bread, light nuttiness, light clove, herbal, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, apple, light banana, honey, caramel, toast, candi sugar, light chocolate, light clove, herbal, bread, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of dark/bready malt and yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong ale. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 28, 2014"

Really a nice, unique holiday ale that doesn't overdo its "holiday" flavors, while doing a really nice job of dealing with its 11abv. Drinks much closer to 9, but with a little bit of heat.

Pours murky amber colored with nearly no head at all. A nice aroma of super sweet caramel, cherries, honey, some booze, maybe some Belgian yeast influence. Flavor is bready malt with a bit of yeast spice, definite sweet cherry presence, caramel, plums, figs. Big heavy slick mouthfeel with low carbonation. Definitely on the sweet side but pretty enjoyable. A bit of oxidization has settled in but that's ok. I would have this again.","BMMillsy","Jan 13, 2014"

3.98,2.8,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,"The head is on the thin side, a semi-deep tan color, not very dense and evaporates swiftly, average lacing without much stick. The liquid is an attractive coppery red with a dark orange tint, large amount of super tiny bubbles swirl about inside, excellent clarity does not weaken the richness of hue, handsome. The nose is full but not soft, filled with sweet honey, molasses, baking spices , candied orange peel and a mix of cola and chocolate, the cherries come through clearly, consistent and unambiguous, no secrets hidden. Full-bodied, Walks at a good pacing, not brisk, but on no leisurely stroll either, the carbonation fluffs it up when needed. The citrus is mixed but helps temper the honey, caramel, chocolate stuff. The cherry fruit base pulled in opposing directions by plum and strawberry flavors. Cola, maybe licorice, there is a sweet smokiness to it as well. Not really as well spiced as one might hope for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, maybe more like a Winter Warmer. The length is so-so. In a fun and convivial environment you could easily through 3-4 of these back in spite of the ABV, alone at home, one, maybe two. There’s no intellectual hook.","farrago","Dec 19, 2013"

It also has hints of sweetness and alcohol. Almost medium body with good carbonation. Nice slick mouthfeel. A superbly balanced beer, with a flavor profile similar to the nose. Tart cherry over a nice sweetness with a chocolate background. For an 11% alcohol brew, this one hides it well - but you get the nice burn all the way through. Crisp finish with a burst of flavor from the carbonation that brings the spice flavor to the forefront. The finish is also where the alcohol becomes more evident as the beer nears room temperature.","tillmac62","Dec 17, 2013"

Very malty, as usual, but a distinct lack of the cinnamon, cardamom, anise, and other wintry spices we thought we were used to.

It's a little like cracking a coors. Tastes like fake cherries and brown sugar. Very sweet. Not too pleasing, but I'm trying to get through it. Consistency is slick, syrupy, and sticky. Pretty flat. This didn't quite work, imo. It's interesting, but ultimately a flop in my eyes.","lunarbrew","Nov 07, 2013"

Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, cherry, and cherry syrup aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but fairly syrupy and sweet.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 26, 2013"

After that I had bought the six pack once, and since it’s so damn expensive I never cared to do it again regardless of how good it is. That was probably two months ago. Tonight however my lovely girlfriend was in the mood for it so I’m drinking it at her expense (thanks baby)! Anyway, this ale is like a mead or a sweet wine and very appropriate on bitter cold winter nights to warm the blood pleasantly. It has a gorgeous color and a wonderful aroma to be appreciated for a while before you actually indulge in to the liquid itself. Its taste is kind of like cocktail cherries with honey laced in between, and a hint of liquor. The inclusion of chocolate malts leave a chocolaty aftertaste with a spiciness on the tongue that I can’t put my finger on. This is a heavy beer with a high ABV that should be consumed slowly, and enjoyed to its fullest, perhaps even shared with a friend.","RummyRedbeard","May 24, 2013"

Malts are somewhere in between a Belgian dubbel and a carmely barleywine. The yeast makes its mark and is a good choice for this beer, feels very 'Belgian' with more age. The alcohol is well disguised and well integrated with the heavy malt. I like this beer better when around the 1-2 year mark, but this was a fun experiment nonetheless. This beer seems to have plenty of detractors, but I find it to be quite delicious at any point in the aging cycle.","twiggamortis420","Jan 28, 2013"

It pours a very red amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma is sugar cane, cherries, honey and some fruity Belgian yeast notes. The taste is sweet with a somewhat cloyingly sweet finish. It’s just a bit of a mess. The flavors don’t really clash, but it’s cloying upon cloying. It’s actually a lot like what I imagine an elf would drink, a sort of fruity beer nectar. Mouthfeel is sticky but otherwise fine. I’m being a bit harsh, but it’s just too over-the-top for me. Lots of sweet flavors in this one.","popery","Jan 27, 2013"

4.4,13.7,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"O - An absolutely fantastic holiday treat, Tröegs Mad Elf is a masterful concoction of subtle Belgian yeast that produces spice nuances without the straight addition of spice. Honey sweetness never becomes cloying but adds a little something extra with the delicate cherry tartness. Just as exceptional fresh, age continues to do this strong beer favors, developing into a delectable and soothing winter sipper.","BeerFMAndy","Dec 23, 2012"

4.19,8.3,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer is the first to emerge from my cellar after a short two month sleep. The beer pours a ruddy ruby, with a light, gently cream colored head. The body of the beer is clear and caramelly with little to no carbonation coming up through. On the nose the beer smells big with honeyed raisins, slight candied sugars, bready caramel, and only the faintest ghost of cherry. Spicy alcohol, similar to what you might find in a quad, is also definitely present in the nose. The beer tastes lightly of cherries and honey, transitioning into bready caramel and Belgian yeast character, with a light alcohol spice. The beer begins with an almost framboise like cherry sweet flavor, mixed quickly with spicy alcohol and then creamy honey which opens the beer into grainier caramel and Belgian yeast notes, and light candied sugars. There is a huge cereal bread taste in the middle of the flavor which dies off quickly, but does leave a light bread lingering in the finish and aftertaste. This beer is hugely complex in flavor, and with only 2 months in the cellar it seems to have none of the huge alcohol flavors that other reviewers describe. On the mouth this beer is smooth and caramelly, sitting on the tongue at a medium to heavy body with nearly no carbonation to speak of. The only bite comes from the faint alcohol at the back of the throat, but this is really quite faint, and considering this is 11%, I really don’t taste the heavy alcohol flavor. Overall, I’m a huge fan of this beer. It is a great holiday sipper, to be had in moderation for sure. I could obviously not slug this beer back, but if you put it in a small glass, swirl it around and observe its holiday appropriate color, and then savor and enjoy it. It kisses the tongue, packs a wallop of alcohol, and seduces my taste buds with warm sweet flavors that I want in a holiday beer. A beer to have on Christmas night for sure!","Maxwell","Dec 22, 2012"

The taste is decent but did not blow me away above average for sure but not greatness same is true for the mouthfeel. The fact that blows me away and will keep me coming back to this beer is the back that the abv is 11% and its totally drinkable., the average person wouldn't even notice.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"this is the quintessential holiday brew for me, i look forward to it each year, and have been cellaring different vintages for experiment. i find a year really cools down the alcohol heat and lets the flavors develop. the fresh one im drinking now pours a rich cherry amber color, with a sexy frothy pearly white head nearly three inches tall. the nose is lots of fruity, cherries, plums, baked pears, lots going on. also some honey or molassas sugar, a lot of booze, and a curious blend of winter spices, a little heavy on the clove. the flavor is identical to the nose, if a bit less fruit forward. its very balanced, and you dont taste the alcohol as much as you smell it, but you sure do feel it. whew. belgian yeast and candy sugar work magically together, creating a velvety grog that is sure to warm up the coldest bones in the winter time. relaxed carbonation and about as full a body as you can have in a beer that still lets some light pass through it. it gets really hot in terms of booze as it warms up, but thats just fine by me. overall one beer that is not to be missed come christmas time, and one that i keep going back to again and again. if you get youself a case, put a few in the basement until next year too, youll be glad you did!","StonedTrippin","Dec 09, 2012"

Moderately sweet with honey and fruit cake. Some cherry skin tannins are present to balance the sweetness. The spices seem a little more muted on the palate, and the mid-palate feels a little watery at times. Sweet on the finish with alcohol, some honey and cherry tartness, there's a lingering yeastiness as well. Carbonation is moderate, making this beer, to my palate and given the style, average at best and not one I'd seek to revisit in a hurry.","DefenCorps","Mar 13, 2012"

A warm sensation is felt with the fruitiness and array of spices that mask the high alcohol content really well. I look forward to this beer's release every year and make certain to store at least a 6-pack of bottles for Christmas in July. A must-drink during the holidays both for its great taste and its ability to make shopping interesting after just one or two.","Louski","Mar 01, 2012"

Taste is spicy at first followed by tart cherry, some funky yeasty flavours, some alcohol in the first few sips but pretty much completley hidden after that. Medium-High carbonation, medium body, good full feel throughout. Not bad but nothing about this blew me away, dont think I would go looking for this but if it was offered its quite drinkable.","peensteen","Feb 27, 2012"

The aroma is sweet and powerful with a lot of honey, cherry, pepper, and belgian yeast character. The flavor is just as the nose let on with a tart cherry sweetness upfront together with honey and belgian yeast character. Hides the alcohol extremely well, not detectable. Rich in flavor and mildly bitter. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Finishes smooth with a lingering cherry tart flavor. Overall, this was a treat to try. Good stuff!","hopfacebrew","Feb 27, 2012"

Very intriguing aroma - has creamy, yeasty, funky & sweet tart elements to it. Sweet wild cherry dominates in the flavor. Interesting concoction in that it has a bit of a Pilsner mouthfeel that is a bit lacking in carbonation. Goes down very spicy and crisp, but it does not seem heavy at all. Later after the sip, a delayed warming sensation kicks in. Good, but there are much better Belgian Strong Dark Ales.","Neorebel","Jan 01, 2012"

This stuff pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a half-finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises cherry, honey, fig, dates, caramel, light biscuit, and mandarin orange. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a pinch of black pepper and nutmeg. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, a rather enjoyable brew, one that doesn't overdo the spices and/or fruit, which many winter brews have a tendency to do. Good times.","TMoney2591","Dec 18, 2011"

Malty and sweet but lacking any complexity. Hints of bread, raisin, cherry. A subtle, spicy yeast flavor tries to come out but is held back. There's flavor but not very much of it. Somehow the alcohol is very well hidden but I don't know how. Slight bitterness; full bodied but with a thin, watery mouthfeel. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but this beer lacks any character whatsoever.

You can see clean through one side of the glass, the beer, and out the other. Pours with the faintest of heads and disappears quickly. The nose is extremely fruity...very winey. The cherries and honey meld together to give this the nose of a mead. It's a lovely scent nonetheless. Were I blindfolded, however, I'd have said this was wine or mead with the quickness. The taste is very sweet, with a shade of tartness to it. The honey and malt tail in at the back end of a taste. This has a very nice mouthfeel to it. Not too heavy, not too thin. It's got a wonderful finish too. Overall, this is a nice, easy drinker that at 11.0%, could very likely catch up to you fast. It doesn't come across nearly as boozy as the ABV suggests it should be.

After a very aggressive pour, the white foam quickly dissipates leaving no cap or lacings. Aromas are amazing, particularly if you let this warm a bit. A solid sweet malt and belgian yeast backbone with tart cherries and hints of spice and booze. Smooth and syrupy feel with light carbonation. Sweet malt and sugar flavors from beginning to end with tart cherry flavors through the middle that transition to spice and then boozy heat at the finish. Finishes semi-dry at first but very dry over the long haul . Most definitely a sipper. The aggressive pour is a must if sampling from a bottle. Plus, don't drink this too cold.

The honey and cherry flavors really shine through, and the beer remains well balanced throughout. Being 11% ABV, the alcohol has a presence so this is a sipper for sure. A pleasure to drink, tons of complexity and tastiness to get through... will most likely be buying a few more of these before the winter season is through.","oriolesfan4","Nov 27, 2011"

3.49,-9.8,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a 12 oz. Bottle into a snifter. It pours a beautiful transparent ruby liquid with 1/2" head that quickly disappears. Smells of spice; clove is what I’m getting with some peppery accent. Tastes of sweet fruits. Clove, fig, and cherry. The cherry was not as pronounced as I imagined it. The honey adds another layer of complexity. Very smooth for 11%. Mildly carbonated and medium bodied. This is definitely a cold weather beer. After 6 oz. I can feel the warming effects.","Koufax21","Nov 02, 2011"

Somewhat clear in appearance. Nose is that of mainly cherry, honey, and some alcohol. Not as complex as the best in style- a little one dimensional for me. Taste is the same- it's not bad.. but up against the best in style, it's lacking complexity and taste. This is a tough style list though, so it's really not bad. Feel is on the lighter side, w/ a nice sweet honey aftertaste. Overall, this is a good beer, it's just missing more yeast, malt, and complexity in the taste/feel. I like the idea of it though.

3.9,0.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I have Mad Elf more on tap these days than in bottles, and the profile is similar, though perhaps they've mellowed out a bit with the recipe so that the taste isn't completely overwhelming. Pours--typically into a stem glass--copper-brown with reddish-orange hues that become more visible in the light. Typically, as with the bottle, an off-white head that retains and laces well, and perhaps is more pronounced when being served on tap. Nose of fruitcake, cherries, honey, dark malts, raisins, and cloves. Some alcohol notable. The taste follows the smell almost to a "t," with complex flavors of dark caramel malts, honey and brown sugar, cherries and raisins, and subtle spice. Some alcohol burn. Medium bodied, full-flavored, and highly desirable. I give it points off overall, because despite the fact that I do like it, it is one of the most inconsistent beers year to year as far as flavor goes.","Rifugium","Jul 06, 2011"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a darker amber orange that was nicely translucent. Head was very thin, slighty off white that left a small ring around the top.

Yeasty phenols to cherries to ripe fruit to spice, an amazing nose. Creamy mouthfeel with a bit of crispness to lift the full body. Alcohol chimes in first with lots of warmth, spice and rose water. Cherry juice, candied fruit and faint medicinal flavors hit the middle with a small tartness within. Spice picks up middle to end, making way for the alcohol to really warm. Sweet, spicy finish. This is one of those slow- sipping nightcap brews--after a long day of holiday bustling, you'll probably need one of these.","BeerAdvocate","Mar 08, 2011"

The aroma brings a eucalyptus cherry caramel malt. Very pleasant. The flavor follows suit with clove and fruit nougat and a subtle lemony hop front. It carrys a thin maltiness with some granny apple hints and yeast overtones. I think this comes off better on tap than it did from the bottle. The cherry backbone seems a bit deeper. Carbonation is kind of fine. It's medium bodied with a slightly syrupy feel. Drinkability is modest, there's a mild alcohol presence.

Still the alcohols are not harsh at all, and I wonder how this would age. Fresh it is a bit thick and sweet, and some how the flavors do nor really meld.

I think the oxidation is a bit much, more than the last time I had this beer, for sure. Mouthfeel is sticky with medium carb, probably on the low end. Drinkability is good, especially for the ABV.

I wasn't sure what I thought of it, but after I tasted it I was hooked. the beer pours an amber color with a white head about 1 finger tall. Head doesn't last long and there is no lacing, but that cones with the territory of 11% ABV beers. Smell is of honey and cherries. If it didn't say honey and cherries on the label I would have described it as a sweet malt and dark fruit smell. Taste starts sweet then finishes with slight honey taste, there are sweet malts throughout. Thickness is about right, no carbonation though (comes with the 11% territory). Overall, despite the 11% ABV I really dig this beer. I got this in a trade with slvrmon82 and will definitely have to send him some more quality beers in order to get some more of this.

It kind of has a medicinal aroma to it also. Again, cherry flavor right up front. It kind of rounds out with vanilla and oak. Again though, it's kind of medicinal; like a cherry cough drop.

Smells sweet and boozy. Cherries are predominant, but a bit complex in that maraschino cherries are discernable as well as dried black cherries. Banana, vanilla, and alcohol round things out. Taste is very reflective of the aroma, although the vanilla note seems replaced by a touch of bitter chocolate and honey. Otherwise cherries are dominant. Alcohol is far more present in the nose than on the palate. The finish is somewhat reminiscent of a cherry cough syrup, but finishes much cleaner than one would suspect.

The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, honey, cherries, bananas, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, honey, slight cherries, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. I can't believe this thing is 11%!

Some mild bitterness comes through on the back end to help cut some of the sweetness. The finish is actually fairly fast and astringent, with some hot alcohol showing up.

The beer keeps the sweetness without the medicinal/cough syrup that a lot of cherry brews have. This is just a great winter brew. There is no way you would ever guess it was a 11% ABV beer.

The esters thrown off by the yeast dominate the mouthfeel and it lingers. As that hits, the alcohol tries to take center stage and makes it feel more medicinal. This beer is sort of all over the place. The flavors come at you in waves and are not well-integrated. Is it sour or bitter? The two sensations fight it out and you're left wondering what it should be. It does improve a little when it warms up and it's possible that laying this down for a year might balance it out and make it more drinkable than it is right now.

I got a hit of effervescence my first taste then it was flat as a pancake, medium-light mouthfeel, not sticky. ABV very well hidden for this alcohol bomb, but IMHO this needs significant cellaring.

Big cherry, clove, Belgian yeast, and caramel malt aroma dominates the nose. Flavor follows the nose - sweet malt backbone with a nice yeasty spice. Cherry/fruity flavors also present, but take a back seat to the typical Belgian strong ale profile. For a beer with no head, this beer is actually pretty well carbonated. Bubbly on the tongue that leaves a sugary sweet coating behind. Very drinkable, I do not want to put this one down.","muttyd","Nov 06, 2010"

I couldn't find the stuff last season! I am not disappointed with the beer itself -- it is very unique and very good! I only question if it is really worth 14.99/six pk when I'm an hour's drive from the brewery. Perhaps I will answer that question after a couple more rounds!

Alcohol flavor is there and leaves a nice hot feel in the back of the mouth. Though the alcohol is there is does not stand out, and I think that is due to a sweet finish. Though there was not much of a head the carbonation was good, went well with the beer. This brew is a surprise as it weighs in art 11 ABV, does not have that feel as the alcohol is hidden quite well.

I was NOT disappointed!! Poured a nice red color but with little to no head that was gone in a heartbeat. The nose was heavy with the honey and cherry as advertised, as well as a background of the alcohol. Lively carbonation on the tongue and the drink itself is very smooth. The taste was very surprising, however, as I was expecting more sweetness based on the aromas. There was some sweet there, but also a nice spicy bite (nutmeg?) that lingered, giving that warm holiday feeling and a fine finish.

The ABV is apparent, but the 11% extent of the ABV is fairly well hidden. This is a sipping beer and it is surprisingly watery in body for a beer of this content.

It's a golden amber color and I notice a minimal amount of streaming bubbles. I smell cherries and banana and clove. Not overly impressive. Smells of Belgian yeast. Not picking up any hops on the nose. I have a feeling this beer would taste much better with a deep chill on it. It lacks the crispness that carries important flavors, so maybe the chill of refrigeration could help. I get a breadiness at first, and on the exhale the alcohol kicks in. Some cherries are very present as well. Mouthfeel fails here for me. Carbonation would send this beer over the edge, but without it I feel like I'm drinking a malty syrup.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some chocolate and a little bit of booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. For the most part the 11% ABV is well hidden. It does catch up to you after a while, but that's to be expected.

Very fruity and nary a hop to be tasted - well maybe a bit in the finish, but this is a big, malty, fruity brew. Color is an appropriate copper, and carbonation a bit muted. Soft, creamy body is nice as well. As for the honey... well, I don't taste it. I suppose the cherry is that much stronger a flavour. Pretty drinkable for a big beer.

Taste was very complex with dark fruit, figs, raisin, malty sweetness, some banana, and an alcohol warmth and an almost port-like smoothness to the finish. Drinkability was moderate, due to the high ABV which was balanced well in the drink but definitely had a presence in the taste. Shouldn't drink one of these too fast, as my father-in-law unwittingly found out tonight.

This bottle is over a year old, so I think what little hop it had has long gone. Body is medium to thick, Mouthfeel is syrupy sweet, carbonation is low.

It says right on the bottle "ale brewed with honey and cherries". Not typically a phrase that leads me to purchase a beer but I've had some great brews that were made with cherries. This is not one of them. The cherry flavor is weak and seems artificial, like Ludens Cough Drops. I know this is not a sour but I'm still underwhelmed. Mouthfeel and drinkability are low due to the medicine/alcohol traits. Overall,the third time wasn't a charm. Although it did get a little better each time it never turned into a good beer.

I'm now down to my last two, less the six pack I'm cellaring for next year, and figured it's time to put finger to keyboard and write a few words. I poured a 12 oz. bottle into my crystal snifter with enough force to create a nice inch thick head. It quickly dissipated, and left a nice bubbly ring around the inside of the glass. The aroma was heavenly; the bold richness of a strong Belgium dark ale with dates and figs, mixed with the tart sweetness of cherries and honey. Upon first taste there is a detection of dark fruits, such as dates, raisins, and figs. Afterwards the sweetness of the honey and the cherries tartness come through. The Mad Elf is a bit lacking when it comes down "mouthability". There is a deficiency in carbonation, which is one of the hallmarks of most strong Belgium dark ales.

It tasted like potent and succulent sour cherry with wild honey malt and lemon hops. As it warmed, the taste of wild yeast became more and more prominent. It was quite thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting tart aftertaste. Overall this was a very flavorful beer, reminiscent of Three Philosophers. It had that unique cherry Belgian flavor that takes a while to get used to, but can be fairly enjoyable. It definitely had clean taste and great body. Most notable was how well it hid the 11% alcohol, which I could barely notice under all that cherry and yeast.

Once I got passed the juicy fruits, I discovered some bitter citrus hops, a splash of banana, a touch of yeast, and a small pinch of toasted malts in the background. The juicy fruits conquered all that were in its path! The mouthfeel was slick! There was no way I could tell that I was drinking a 11% ABV beer.

The head retention was decent, with a solid ring settling into place, and the off-white bubbles were a bit sticky and spotty. The nose was a combination of fruit and spices, backed up by a rich maltiness, with notes of banana, tropical fruits, and cloves. The taste was pretty good - very fruity, mostly juicy rather than dried, with lots of banana and berry, plus a pleasant bread character and a balanced spiciness. Full bodied with lightish carbonation that was well integrated into the texture. It was palate coating, yet just short of being sticky, with a mild warmth. Pretty good stuff overall and a tasty Xmas treat. I did find it just a little too sweet though.","DrJay","Jan 15, 2008"

4.24,9.6,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Thanks to FroggyFrog for the sample! Pours a clear amber hue with a fizzy, pale tan head of two fingers. Dismal retention and no lacing but thats forgivable given the ABV. Wild berry and tropical fruit phenols; more alcoholic than Belgian. Vanilla bean and toasted malt aromas in the background, with undertones of champagne yeast and honey. First sip is sweet with toasty pale malt, a touch of caramel, and some errant dextrins. A flash of zesty marachino cherry, reminiscent of a young Kreik. Subdued Belgian Phenolics are more tart than funky, and combines with the other flavors to mask the alcohol very well. The aftertaste is a little boozey, and further dries out the palate after the mild hop bitterness balances the malts. The mouthfeel is ultimately well-balanced, dancing from sweet, to tart, to dry, and finally a clean alcoholic heat with all flavors receeding- leaving no cloying or residual sugar. The medium-light body is well-attentuated and well-carbonated- thus giving the mouthfeel a light and spritzy character- capable of lifting the powerful elements displayed. Finishes surprisingly mellow, as the malt, alcohol and yeast profile seem to apex, then fade away rapidly leaving only faint white-wine notes on the tounge for the last few swigs. Solid drinkability given the high alcohol, and an impressive interpretation of the style.","PBRstreetgang","Apr 24, 2007"

A ton of alcohol obvious in the taste at first but it ramps back a bit after a while. Cherries come through later, along with a heavy maltiness. Sticky syrupy mouthfeel. A sipper i think.

Aroma shows some cherry, some tartness and behind this a deeper light sweetness. The alcohol is present in the aroma as a fairly rich booziness. There is a dry white wine character in the aroma as well. There is a mix of tartness and a light sweetness and cherries up front in the taste, followed by a nice breadiness and finishing with a slightly dry small alcohol bite. Body is fairly light and thin. The alcohol although present is fairly well balanced for its strength and its light body. Not something I'd drink a few of back to back, but I look forward to aging some and seeing how it develops. Nice festive beer, I enjoyed the tartness which mixed well with the slight dryness and alcohol in the finish.","hoppymeal","Nov 29, 2006"

The taste does have a bit of honey to it (as the label suggests), and that same cherry that was in the smell. The alcohol is pleasantly not overpowering, even at the advertised 11%, leading to a drinkable brew. It adds a touch of bitterness to go with the tart cherry and sweetish honey. Still, the aroma is a big part of this beer, so I'm glad I waited to review it at a time I could savor it.","weasbri","Nov 29, 2006"

It leaves some sparse and slick lacing when the glass is tilted. The beer's body is a slightly transparent cherry red, tinted gold just a bit. The nose is very forward with cherry and estery fruit notes, as well as strong yeastiness. There's a note of spiciness, which I know must come largely from the alcohol, but seems to indicate hops as well. The aroma doesn't exactly leap from the glass, though. The taste is at first very sweet and cherry flavored, but it quickly moves into a characteristic flavor of Belgian yeast. It then exhibits a distinct breadiness. It lingers in the mouth with an acidic bread note. Alcohol is well hidden, so long as you don't sip too much or too often. Considering this beer's heft, the mouthfeel is somewhat light, which makes it an easy drinker. Carbonation is slight, too.","mjc410","Nov 27, 2006"

Since I like sweet, no worries, but some would probably describe it as cloying. Strong yeast character as well. Hops is listed on the website as only 15 IBUs, which seems true with no hop character, so the yeast is the main component for the spicy notes. Very cool, fun beer with lots of character and punch.

The Elf is dark, the appearance looks wonderful and the smell hints of spices of Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Albiet faintly, but they are there. From that alone I was thinking that this was going to be a treat. Alas, the mouthfeel was clean , but the taste seemed to be missing the spices. The alcholol wasn't that pronounced, which was good, but something was lacking overall. From the nose I'd be thinking of something Belgian. However, the aftertaste assures me that this is an imitation. All of that combined made me glad that I had crossed paths with this one at a local pub. I had almost purchased a case, ( Archaic Pa. LCB Law), prior to finding this one bottle. For the abv content the case cost was rather low. I should have known something was up. While the Elf is a far cry from being the worst, it's an even a further cry from being the best.

The label on the bottle states that this beer was brewed with honey and cherries, but I can barely detect these ingredients. This beer reminds me of an English barleywine/old ale because of the overall sweetness and the light hop flavor. BA lists this as a Belgian Strong dark ale, but I wouldn't know in a blind tasting.

Toward the end of the bottle when it really warmed up, I was picking up some light clove and a light woodsy smell. Flavor-wise, it starts out with rather typical Belgian flavors, mostly because I had served it too cold. it then opens to reveal a wonderful malt backbone and a complex array of flavors, but its the duo of cherries and sweet malts that steal the show. I admit at first it threw me a bit, but the second try was much better. And it kept getting better all the way to the bottom of the glass.

It is a clear, brilliant red/orange that is fit for a gemstone, but looks lifeless with no head or beads of carbonation and, hence, no lacing. It smells Belgian, with fruits (maraschino cherries?), malts, pepper/spiciness, and alcohol near the end. The taste has this plus medicinal phenols, banana, hints of clove, and perhaps some bubblegum. The body is medium and the drinkability is about what I would have expected. Not the best from Tröegs, but we'll see what the cellar will do to it.","mmmbeer","Dec 29, 2005"

The beer had a dark red hue, with a very thin head that did not retain much aroma. Something mildly fruity was there, like watermelon. The first sip was metallic and stingy. Hot alcohol abounded. Midway through, the fruit came through more predominantly--strawberry mostly, and other juicy red fruits. It reminded me a bit of Juicy Fruit gum. I could not detect the spicy yeastiness normally associated with Belgian-style beers. The pint I had felt a little thin. It was not what I was expecting or hoping for in an American-made Christmas release of a belgian strong dark.","dnrobert24","Dec 29, 2005"

There wasn't a lot of carbonation and to my surprise almost no alcohol warming for an 11 percent ABV brew. This beer was very drinkable and I haven't been able to have just one yet. I wish Troegs would add a small amount of hops to balance the sweetness of this beer which is something I would never thought I'd say about a Troegs beer.

I love the color, ruby red. Elegant, sophisticated, like the taste. Beer tastes more like a cordial, essence of berry, a warm brandy like effect. Excellent balance and mouthfeel make this beer dangerously drinkable, even for some of my non-beer friends. The big suprise being that is has a decidedly strong kick to it(11% can defintiely sneak up on you..)A wonderful, happy glass of holiday cheer, a way to keep the holday spirit alive through cold winter nights.

A good bit of bubblegum in the aroma, a touch of clove (yeast or spice?), coriander, peppery alcohol and a touch of malt.

Every time the door swung open, the whole bar iced over. Drinking Mad Elf made me welcome the cold breeze that night, warming me like a brandy by a fire. It's the best holiday beer I had this season, and I tried many. The Elf is spicy with just the right amount of sweetness. The beer's taste doesn't mask its might -- a winter-worthy 11-percent -- but the ale is nonetheless pretty drinkable. The Elf has melted this Gnome's heart.","GnomeKing","Jan 04, 2005"

Spicy-sweet malt aromas complimented by a fruity, definately-Belgian yeasty, biscuity note. Taste is surprisingly less sweet than anticipated. Triple-like in character with a pleasantly subdued cherry/berry flavor balanced out by a spicy malt and hop profile. Big mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Extremely enjoyable. I was expecting an overly sweet, cherry flavor, but this is very nice.

The cherry aftertaste though is horrid. Truely horrid. A very unbalanced beer, the alcohol is very evident and makes it an unpleasent, if warming, drinking experience.

It pours a red, slightly hazy color with a thin head. The head is slight, and disappears quickly. The aroma is intense, and predominately of sour cherries. Underneath, there is a malt-like sweetness and alcohol. The taste is fruity, malty, and fairly complex. Medium to heavy body, with low carbonation.

Tight, almost abrasive carbonation gives the tongue a heads up while a rush of tastes enliven the palette. Noble hop aromas, carmelized cherries, subtle malt sweetness, along with a complex, spicy dimension typical of Belgian strong ales combine to express qualities of licorice and bubblegum. The high alcohol content is gracefully hidden in the taste, revealing itself with a warming sensation in the chest. This is a big beer that most certainly must be consumed in moderation. I am more than impressed with the Elf, however Mad he may be. This years version easily lives up to all the hype.","tenant","Nov 24, 2004"

Aroma is sweet fruity cherry but also apples on top of honey and malt with light hints of chocolate malt but very light. Smells very good some alcohol is also present but it compliments the fruity aroma and is not a distraction. Taste is sweet fruity cherries dipped in honey that linger until light choclate picks up and adds some to the sweetness followed by lingering alcohol enhanced very light bitterness thats slightly sour like green apples maybe more so then any hops. A light spice tingle is also felt thru out the experience but very light and for me undefinable. Alcohol is evident thru out but always in the background and complimenting the experience it warms the body and the soul hard to believe it is 11% taste more like 8%. Mouthfeel is suprisingly medium was expecting something little heavier but that makes it that much more dangerous.

Seeing as it came out the same did I was picking up some other beers I decided to give it a try again. This pours out a cherry juice red with a decent beige head that eventually falls to a coating of bubbles. Decent lacing was left around the glass as this was consumed. Aroma was a bit sweet with a bit of cherries and a bit of spiciness. Alcohol was evident but it mixed well and added positively to the smell. The taste starts off with a sweet maltiness that had notes of cherries and other fruits with a touch of honey. There was a good amount of spice as well. Aftertaste was a lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel was about medium with a slick and warming feel to it. Pretty damn good drinkability here with the large alcohol being hidden really well. It did warm me up quite a bit as I drank it. Overall this is a very interesting and tasty beer that I would recommend if you havent had it already. Oh and Venoms suggestion to have it warm was spot on.","meathookjones","Nov 17, 2004"

Rather thin bodied unfortunately, low carbonation. A beer that is hard to interpret well, this could be a spicy cooler for all I know, but its not without pleasure to sip.

Taste is not the tartness one might expect from the cherry aroma, but malts upfront, combined with a deep sweet cherry flavor, which is not overdone, as could easily be a problem, but just right. Alcohol kind of creeps in at the end, in a nice kind of way. Mouthfeel excellent, just like a Belgian dark that you would expect, and the drinkability is excellent, in that even if you aren't interested in another straightaway, the character of the brew will make you return at another time.

Malty, as the beer warmed the flavors improved. The cherry tartness softened, while the dull bread was balanced out. All the time a slightly medicinal alcohol heat and flavor. Delicate carbonation, light to moderate bodied, but never watery. Held together remarkably. Got a little sticky sweet to finish. I thought this would be classified as a Fruit/Vegetable beer, but definitly can see it's Belgian dark strong ale classification as well. Doesn't have the earthyness of a belgian, but the heat, and complexity are there.

Heeding VENOM’s warning, I served this one warm (but not quite room temperature as I expected it to warm further). Great advice, but next time I will probably start drinking this a touch colder, as it warms quickly and the sweetness begins to dominate. This is an impressive achievement, combining complexity, depth of flavor, warming alcohol, and an impressive texture in one great beer. A bargain considering the product.

The most noticeable aroma was candied cherry, with qualities of dry cherry Jell-O mix...very nice and wonderfully lush despite the reference to Jell-O. Joining the cherry was a subtle and sweetish malt aroma, and just the slightest hint of alcohol, as it warmed. Tasting the beer revealed a satisfying cherry-malt sweetness, retaining the complexities of fresh cherries. Brandy-like cherry flavors washed over my palate, hitting all of my taste senses with a pleasant warmness. An appropriate level of bitterness rounds out the finish, with some cherry and subtler honey aromatics lingering. Sweetness does not remain in the finish, to its credit. Mouthfeel was full and smooth, although the carbonation level was a tad low. This could have been caused by mishandling/freezing temps on its journey to my fridge. Alcohol was very well hidden in the nose and taste, and was only noticeable by its warming qualities. I found this to be a delightful and rich winter warmer, to be enjoyed by the fire.

I would like this beer to have a bit more body, as that would firm up an otherwise great and unique product. Carbonation is light, alcohol is noticably present but quite drinkable.

There is quite a bit of sweetness (though not overly so), and it has quite the alcoholic kick in the finish (though not in a bad way, it is in no way a harsh kick). There is a mellow fruitiness that pervades this beer throughout. It is quite light bodied, especially for an 11%'er. The honey probably helps to dry it out.

Nothing is overpowering in this beer. the cherries, malt and hops blend together for a fruity wine taste that is pleasant, even for a guy who doesn't want fruit in beer. this hits the lips light and finishes full.

Slightly medicinal and herby, again I believe I detect juniper with an alcohol spiciness at the back of the nose. Flavor is of big sweet cherries (again) and a bit of bready yeast, with the honeyish flavors showing up much better from the bottle than from on tap (for whatever reason). Seems much sweeter than my previous tastings--almost a cola note--verging on cloying IMO. Mouthfeel is still respectably smooth with more alcohol tingle; I would almost say a slightly thick, yogurty (?) finish is left behind. Drinkability is a bit better than fair.

4.42,14.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The color a limpid luxurious ruby on the pour with a smallish head that is frothy in texture, light tan in color and as it disperses rather quickly the resultant lace forms a rather thin velum like sheet that just does cover the glass. The aroma of over ripe fruit, such as pineapple greets you first, hints of fusel alcohol along with the malted grains brings up the rear, bubble gum like tones also present with the start ambrosial and rich in malt with the top middling to almost full in feel. Finish is vinous, sternly acidic, the hops delectable in their spicy bite, desert dry and somewhat tart aftertaste that leaves you longing for another sip. Quite a pleasure to drink, big time tummy warmer, a great Winter Warmer, and one I wish was more readily available.","Gusler","Dec 25, 2003"

4.23,9.3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The first sip reveals an off sweetness and cherry undertones are evident. The alcohol is only faint on the swallow with some belly warming action occurring. The body is medium thickness with some vinous characteristics, maybe a little viscous. Overall very drinkable. I actually had three of the bottles tonite over a 2 hour span and definitely feel the alcohol a little by the 3rd even if I didnt taste it. this beer is definitely worth the wait. Hopefully you have tried some and if not try to get it and good luck!","sulldaddy","Dec 24, 2003"
3.45,-10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Hand delivered from the Washington area to Moscow as part of a fiver set of U.S. winter brews. Definitely not my favorite of the five, although I had entertained very high hopes. Poured clear copper under a thin tan head that fades quickly. The nose is mildly sweet, with a touch of cherry. The mouth is fairly flat and heavy with sweetness and fruit. The taste opens with mostly sweet cherries, backed by malt and a touch of honey. I could detect no hops anywhere, but there is some alcohol burn in the finish. The aftertaste is all cherry. It's OK, but I'm not thrilled.","Globetrotter","Dec 20, 2003"
4.66,20.4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Clear deep scarlet red hue. A medium sized beige head literally fizzes away in seconds. Not even a thin coating is left. Only a creamy edging that leaves sparse lace. The aroma is really quite remarkable. Beautiful belgian yeastiness, breadiness and mustiness. Sweet brown sugar. And delicate cherry notes. I love it. Oh man, this is one dangerous brew. The taste is fine. The mouthfeel is luscious. And the alcohol is nowhere to be found. This all adds up to an exceptional drinkability. The flavors are subtle, but quite discernable. Chocolate covered cherries. Bready yeastiness. Dark belgian malts. Raisin and rum. A little sweet honey. But I can hardly find a hint of alcohol here. And it's 11%?!? Damn. Maybe just a bit of a lingering bitterness on the aftertaste derived from EtOH. The beer feels like silk in the mouth and the body is medium at best. I understand the "Mad Elf" hysteria now. This is damn good.","Bighuge","Dec 18, 2003"

Anything else? I don't know, I got sick of having to work for it. Taste was sickly sweet up front, cherry juice with minimal spicy hints. Quite thin for such a high abv beer. Lots of candi sugars? Finish was a bit drier with hot alcohol hits. Overall, just an average attempt IMO, yes, even warm.","pbrian","Dec 16, 2003"
4.36,12.7,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I had this on tap at Fat Heads in the Southside of Pittsburgh. Poured a ruby red, very little head that quickly vanished. The smell was of cherries and a bit of alcohol. The taste was amazing. Cherries, alcohol, and a hint of chocolate. A very exellent beer for the holiday season, I only wish that they would have made more of it... maybe next year. Beware, that 11% abv will come back to haunt you in the morning, but it's well worth it.","soulfly967","Dec 14, 2003"

3.83,-1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Sampled this years version and not quite as impressed. Lacked the high notes that last years had. Cherry and honey present.

4.28,10.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A snap, crackle, pop accompanies the head, with bubbles bursting at the surface. Soon settles down into an off-white table top. Very nice lacing stretching across the glass. Body is a deep, clear red. Cherries shine thru the aroma, as soon as I started to pour. Taste features prominently everything mentioned on the label: cherries, honey, alcohol, and also the malt and hops don't get lost. The malt, honey, and the sense of alcohol create a sort of dopplebock quality, and the cherries are well balanced into the mix, featured but not overwhelming. I feel if you left the cherries out, you would still have a good beer. But I'm not suggesting that. I think the honey is really pulling everything together, balancing flavors, rounding the mouthfeel. I have never been a big fruit beer fan, but I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The stock is going fast, but give it a try if you have the opportunity. Tröegs continues to impress.","RonfromJersey","Dec 06, 2003"
4.29,10.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Found on draft at Mad Mex the Robinson location, I was just excited to see at tap handle from Troeg's. Appearance: Ruby tinted thin creamy white head little lacing alcohol wards this off. Aroma: Cherries soaked in alcohol with a mild tartness in the air, spices bringing more Christmas cheer, and the malts used a much more complex than bringing out a caramel / mild cocoa scent. Taste: Is comparable to a cherry liquer massive alcohol note sweeps the palate, very warming spicy with tart sweetness and a soft finish this one ties it together. Mouthfeel: Troeg's went MAD this beer has crazy amount of alcohol kicking, full syrupy mouthfeel definitely a one glass at a time type brew. Drinkability: Didn't get tired of the rich tones thought it would be overbearing I was served sixteen ounces of this fine nectar for six bucks not a bad deal.","WVbeergeek","Dec 05, 2003"

4.13,6.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a neat one. I am not a big fan of Belgian-style ales. I just don't get into the sweet stuff. But the cherries balance that out for me and this ale is nice because of that. The head is very thin but stays around for the duration of the glass. There is a nice lacing left on the glass. The first taste brings a warming feeling that is quite similar to a glass of wine. The honey adds a nice compliment to the sweet taste. The mouthfeel is quite nice. It seems to have a clean finish to each taste with a hint of spices. The alcohol is strong so you wouldn't want to have many, but there is a nice sense of winter drinkability to the beer. I live 40 minutes from the brewery and can't get my hands on any more. It sold way too fast. Ration it if you have it. Cheers","Maestro","Dec 02, 2003"
4.32,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4," This beer seems to be sucked into my tongue like a sponge. I have to squeeze it to let all the flavors come out, and they do so in great fashion. The start has a beautiful fruit flavor, which then gives you a hint of the alcohol. The warming character is excellent. Spices come in next led by clove. Slight notes of caramel are found occasionally as well. The finish is very balanced, and it leaves you with a spicy aftertaste. This is an excellent brew. The complexity is very nice, and even though it is a pretty heavy beer, it's body is not thick as to hinder drinkability to those who like something lighter. I could drink it all day. I only hope that a good amount of BAs got their hands on this one because it is excellent.","ElGuapo","Dec 02, 2003"
4.53,17.1,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability - It is very drinkable on a cold day. Reminds me of Christmas in frnt of a warm fire. Be careful...at 11% alcohol, this one will turn your Happy Holidays into 8 Crazy Nights if you aren't careful!","Edwin","Nov 30, 2003"
4.06,4.9,5,4,4,4,4,"Wow, the appearance alone is worth making the purshase for. Deep ruby color with a fluffy off-white head. Aroma is more sugary than malty, must be from the honey, Taste is much of the same. Surprisingly, the cherry isn't as distinct as you would think. It is presant though and gives this a drinkability that you wouldn't expect from a 11% beer.","dmarch","Nov 28, 2003"
3.77,-2.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a nearly clear cherry red color with no head at all. Just a thin ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Aroma is fruity and malty with strong notes of sweet cherries. I also detect yeast in the aroma. Has a nice crispness like a Belgian Tripel. Flavor is sugary sweet and syrupy with lots of cherries. Alcohol is well hidden, a pleasurable brew.","BierReise","Nov 28, 2003"
4.32,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is the best brew I have had that was made with cherries. It absolute blows away the Unibroe cherry beer, hands down. It smelled like cherries and had a very nice malty aroma with it, as well as the alcohol. The appearance was pretty nice, with the pretty amber color and a creamy head. The head was nice, but lasted a few minutes, then died out to a thin laceing. The taste was similar to the smell, but a little stronger in the cherry area(not too much though, nicely balanced), but the alcohol was barely there for the taste. I was thinking that it was going to be really alcoholy tasteing, but it was hardly noticeable. Man/woman, if it weren;t such a full bodied brew, I would be able to suck this stuff down all night.","JISurfer","Nov 27, 2003"

2.88,-25.6,4,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Its a very interesting beer, but in my opinion, should be more balanced out with a better fruit sweetness and not so harsh. This beer is way too young, and could see it aging very well. Too bad there isnt any left of it.","pezoids","Nov 22, 2003"
4.23,9.3,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"Drinkability: Not to reference my thread about mixing this and Samichlaus together, but I do wonder if one would be moved from the "naughty" to the "nice" column if I left a few of these for ol' St. Nick. A great, high-octane fruit beer.","ManekiNeko","Nov 22, 2003"
4.2,8.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The Mad Elf pours a nice red color. Not really amber, more of a ruby. The head leaves quickly, probably due to the high alcohol content. The aroma is subtle fruit and spices. The fruit is cherry and it is in the background behind the spices. The label gives no hint at the spice, but I can pickup clove and cinnamon aromas. The flavor is really nice with subtle spice and sweet malt and a semi-dry finish that leaves you with the impression of cherries. The alcohol is only apparent in the warmth you feel after swallowing.","GCBrewingCo","Nov 21, 2003"
4.3,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This pours a very nice looking clear reddish color. It has a nice cherry nose & it's taste is tart yet sweet. It was very enjoyable.

It tasted a lot like it smelled, sweet, honey-ish, fruity, but no banana, and no real taste of the alcohol either, which for me can be dangerous with something as yummy as this, because I'll just want to drink more and forget what I'm drinking, and.... become a Mad Elf myself!

The taste is big on maltiness with some slight background spicy hoppiness and candy-like sweetness. Finishes out sweet and fruity, with really no hint of the 11% alcohol contained within. It will be interesting to see how this cellars in the coming months.","beerluvr","Nov 09, 2003"

4.2,8.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This one lets you know up front that it means business, as there's a pleasant, balanced warming surge o' alcohol throughout. Rather dryish, with cherries, some hints of spice, and chocolatey flavors that are more mildly tart than sweet - really interesting flavors going on. As it goes down, some of the tartness dissipates and an oak cask sort of flavor briefly appears. It gets even better as it warms, with the alcohol heading into the background even further. Medium bodied, with a more dry than sweet mouthfeel. A very tasty barleywine.","sponberg","Jan 15, 2003"
4.45,15,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured into the glass a ruby/red/garnet color that sparkled when held to the light. The head was white no lace and did not last, only a film was left. The aroma was fruit and alcohol. Nose of cherries, spices, plums, malt and alcohol were all present at different points on my tongue. The tastes were of spices, fruit (mostly cherries) alcohol and malt. Slightly sweet and tart but not overpowering. I rather enjoyed this beer, it surprised me after my first sip, I was imagining some different flavors then I received. The flavors intensified as this brew warmed.","Jarod","Jan 13, 2003"
4.23,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours an unbelievable reddish, garnet color with a slight head that fades quickly. Very little lace. Aroma of cherries comes through right away, with a slightly tart mouthfeel. Not overwhealming tartness, but a serious alcohol taste, that tries to hide behind the cherries. Much better as it warms, which is easy to do because this is a sippin' beer! Just a guess, but the ABV has to be around 11%. Truely a "nightcap" beer!","HopheadEd","Dec 27, 2002"
4.65,20.2,4,4,5,4.5,5,"A reddish brown body is capped by a creamy tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some minor lace. The aroma is limited but expresses a soft maltiness, a light touch of alcohol, and a sharp fruitiness similar to cranberry (although cherries are actually used). The body is medium with a gentle, fine bubbled carbonation that leaves it creamy and smooth across the palate. The flavor comes alive with an exceptional balance of light spice, juicy & mildly tart cherry, and a chocolate-tinged malt. The cherry flavor becomes clearer as it crosses the palate, coat-tailed by a firm bitterness and some noticeable alcohol. It finishes dry with only minimal lingering malt notes. Well done and highly drinkable. Somewhat Belgian in character due to the fruit and spice. An exceptionally enjoyable beer that's well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Dec 14, 2002"
4.23,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Maybe a little young, but this barley wine is good. Dark ruby color looks great when held to light. Smells of sweet cherry and alcohol.
