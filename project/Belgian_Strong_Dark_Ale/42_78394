It could be that I've had beers of this style that were more complex, or maybe I'm just not a huge fan of this beer in particular. I am a huge fan of Brewery Ommegang however, and this is the only beer I've had from them that I didn't like. In my opinion, it was over carbonated and a bit too sweet for my tastes.

Taste is also a great mix of candi sugars with some dried fruits and a solid Belgian malt backbone. Body is full enough for style with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Some spices can also bed detected. Very solid offering and this is a beer I could have more regularly.","Phyl21ca","Aug 12, 2014"

Head retention is good, and there's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like dark fruit, molasses, peppery spice, and some coffee and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some tart cherries and candi sugar noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew and definitely worth trying. But it's also a bit pricey at $13.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Oct 22, 2013"

Smells of carob, raisins, hay, and lemons. I think my mom made that as a soup once. The taste is very nice, leather, bread, a graininess, and then a dry finish. The mouthfeel is substantial, slick, and lightly carbonated. Overall, this is really a nice beer.

Pours moderately cloudy extremely dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, pear, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, light roast, pepper, clove, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, apple, molasses, toast, chocolate, dark bread, toffee, floral, light roast, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, floral, light roast, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark malts with yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, moderately slick, and lightly foamy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is and excellent Belgian strong dark ale! All around nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for a the gravity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 13, 2013"

A fairly high carbonation is apparent from the first pour. The smell is yeasty and not much else. The taste is rye bread, malts, a hint of hops and very little sweetness of any kind. The beer is a bit boozie a result. Mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation, and not too thin. Basically my only complaint is it needs some sweetness to balance it out. Otherwise worth a try.","Kevin73","Jan 11, 2013"

There is a very faint alcoholic edge in the finish and that quickly faded to a sweet warmth. Bitterness is low but adding the yeast by agitating did seem to all a bit of light chalkiness to the finish while at the same time adding a smoothness. Curious. Feel is quad like in its thickness but a touch lighter and well carbonated with a gentle creaminess. A very deep and delightful brew.

Floral spicy yeast base, with dark roasted malts slightly creamy acidity almost yogurt like.

The nose is very nice, with lots of plum, raisin, and fig. There's a little bit of roasty grains and clove-like phenols present in the background. The roast and phenols come way to the foreground in the flavor profile. That combination, present in that intensity, ends up coming off as a bit harsh/astringent. Sweet-ish dark fruits are still present, but somewhat drowned out by the other aspects of the flavor profile. The body has just a touch too much heft, but it's paired with a very active, expressive carbonation. Art of Darkness seemed promising at first, but just missed the mark for being a great take on a Belgian Strong Dark Ale.

The sample I got fizzed quite a bit, so I recommend having a towel handy when you crack open a bottle. Aroma has notes of caramel and molasses plus hints of licorice and pear. Superb flavor has a malty core and fruity, caramel and molasses tones, hints of horehound, licorice and honey. Smooth, firm-bodied texture does not have a lot of fizz, but it still pleases. Let this "dark side" seduce you while you have the opportunity.","Cyberkedi","Apr 26, 2012"

3.98,0.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer pours an extremely dark brown into black coloring with a light, frothy, half an inch of foamy head on the pour that settles into a sparse filmy coating. Aromas are effervescent and very well blended, with a roasted grain backbone, earthy notes, some smokey highlights, and a light sweetness throughout. Flavors are equally dynamic, with a smoked and roasted sugary caramel backbone, hints of blackstrap molasses throughout, bitter coffee characteristics, and a dry hopping at the end that cleans the palate. Very well layered and blended flavor profile. The more you drink, the more reveals itself to you, with highlights of cocoa nib, fig, date, and more as you go. Tasty beer. The aftertaste is minimal thanks to the hops presence, with a touch of tangy caramel and booze. The finish is clean and quick. This is a beer that is heavy on flavor while light in mouth. Good brew.","GarthDanielson","Apr 16, 2012"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Where the Art of Darkness doesn't portray the breadth, earthy boldness, or assertive complex sweetness as many darker strong Belgian ales, it's relies on a simplified palate that's exquisitely balanced, more yeast-neutral, and somewhat subdued to celebrate its shear drinkability in understated fashion.","BEERchitect","Apr 02, 2012"

I love it because it had those same flavors of my Ommegang brew (abbey ale), but those flavors were very mild; the rest of the beer is big and bold. I love the appearance because it looks like a slightly watered down cup of black coffee with a lot of head on it. Plus, who doesn't like a liberal beer? Bravo!","carlton012","Apr 01, 2012"
3.55,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Served from tap into Trappe Door tulip. Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a two finger light khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, earth, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet amlt, dark fruit, bread, earth, and very subtle sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. While the flavor and aroma on this one was fairly complex, it just left a little to be desired if I am completely honest. All of the right aspects for the style were definitely present, but I just wish they would have come across a little more balanced. Worth trying if you get the chance though.","thagr81us","Mar 31, 2012"
