4.31,5.6,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,"This stuff is pretty light colored for a BSDA. Still a pretty beer to behold with a deep burnished gold and an dark off white head that leaves some nice lacing. In fairness I accidentally cracked this 32 oz bottle by accident as it was mislabeled by my vendor so it might have had a bit more carbonation and such had it remained at unopened and a bout an ounce or so fuller. Hardly flat it shows light carbonation as it sits and a leaves nice decoration as I drink. The nose is delicate and sophisticated. Lots going on. The peated malt is remarkable. A delicate smoke wrapped around sweet lightly breadiness. Hints of coriander honey and maybe a touch of citrus. Faint notes of bubblegum live in pods of anise. Taste is a great followup to the nose. Peaty malt abounds with a honey and spice cake center. Light fruits, apple and pear, maybe a touch of mellon. The anise shows itself a touch more and builds a great platform for the hops. herbal and spicy they nod back to the body of the brew while giving a clean dry finish. Notes of pepper linger along with cinnamon, graham and brown bread. Just a hint of alcohol but not enough to serve a warning. Feel is velvety with a light creaminess. Light enough to encourage sessioning with the aforementioned hidden alcohol. Just enough presence to lead you to sip and savor. This will compliment any food you find yourself near. From traditional winter to lighter fare with an artisnal flare. This is a beer that is sublime and superior. One of my new faves this year and so far my favorite from Allagash","scootny","Jan 14, 2014"

4.1,0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into chalice, batch 19(probably a few years old). Pours a hazy reddish orange color with a nice foamy 1 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass, with nice carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big prune, golden raisin, pepper, coriander, clove, caramel, candi sugar, and spicy yeast. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big caramel, prune, raisin, apple, pepper, molasses, biscuit, clove, roasted nut, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, molasses, biscuit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors with the spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Drinks really smoothly despite the slightly prickly carbonation. Alcohol is nicely hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Quadrupel style offering from Allagash. Great balance of flavors with a high amount of complexity; and is super smooth to drink as well given the 7.2%.","superspak","Feb 05, 2012"

Peach/apricot flavors mix with spices, producing a nice, light beverage (but still full on flavor!) that nicely complements the colder fall days. Hops are kept to a minimum, so the bitterness is subtle, and grain flavors tend more towards lightly-toasted Grape Nuts. Drink this one while staring at the New England foliage in October, when the leaves turn red and golden-brown.","jondeelee","Aug 14, 2011"

Taste dominated by the sweetness - carmel apple, plum and citrus, bready and lightly toasted malts, holiday like spicing more muted then the nose, slight notes of booze.

Smell is berries up front and not fake berry either, a pleasant whiff of toasted malts with bread, some caramel, and than with warming a disgusting scent that reminds me of a basement. Taste is nice though and not so in your face and sugary like alot of quads, more should be made in this vain IMO. Berry forward, plum over apple, caramel sweetner, fruity over sugar, my type of quad. No alcohol interference. Feel is superior and medium making for at least two goblets to go down the hatch, I can't say that with any other quad.

(EDIT: as the beer warms, this flavor fades away. Turns into more of that floral feeling I describe later). The spicing makes up for it, though. Definitely has that Allagash taste to it, it doesn't really seem to have a breadiness to it, not much in the way of heartiness. A medium-bodied feel all the way through. More of a hop presence than I would expect, not bitter though, more of a pine presence. A little nutty there at the end, too. Also has a floral presence, someone else said jasmine, I have no idea what jasmine tastes like (except Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, mmm) but we'll go with that. A little thin in the middle where I think it should be warming. The spicing kicks in in the middle though, and carries it along on the palate. Tastes slick and soapy, the beer slides right off the palate, but the flavor remains. Some good (spices yay), some bad (vinegaric, boo). Very drinkable, goes down like candy (that's what she said!) Overall, everything is pretty balanced, as it gradually warms, all these different parts add to a complex, delicate, delicious harmony. Not a bad way to drink off the cold winter months. Not my favorite brew, nor my favorite Allagash brew (FOUR, so far!) but I'd probably seek this out again (might grab some more to last a while before Julio's is out!) and would definitely drink this again.

The aroma is nice and mild with an earthy yeastiness. Scents of spices tickle the nose I detect the likes of nutmeg, cloves, and perhaps a touch of coriander. A smooth moderately complex flavor is present. I slowly sipped on a couple of these throughout my evening, real nice drink. A subtle presence of malts lend way to a calm spicy profile. Licorice is evident now along with the spices previously mentioned. Well behaved and not over the top in the least I really enjoy this flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit weak. I wouldn't call it thin but there is a lackluster feel to this one and the finish is somewhat odd, not unpleasant perhaps just not in line with the aroma and flavor.

3.93,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This is a very nice beer and well worth seeking out. It pours a cloudy orangy amber color, with just a bit of foam around the rim. No real lacing with this one. It is surprisingly lighter than expected. I would have tagged this for a full bodied, sweet, syrupy, candied sugar Belgian, but not so really. It is more medium bodied, less spicy, with less the candied sugar heaviness. It does have the clove, coriander, rind, fruitiness that one would expect, and plenty of spices in the allspice family. It lacks the peppery snap at the end, tends to be a bit more musty, a little less of the yeasty mouthfeel, and just more summery than I imagined. The finish and aftertaste is a bit sourish spicy, not peppery. This is very drinkable, the ABV is hidden quite nicely, and there is no lingering throaty aftertaste that is too common for the style. The aroma is the weakest link in that it is too subdued, a little more husky than I would have imagined as well. This is a good beer, enjoyable, and not as wintery a beer as the marketing leads one to believe. Have this anytime. L'Chaim.","albern","May 11, 2008"

A nice soapy head that dissipated fairly quick leaving some nice soapy lacing on the glass. The smell is of Belgian yeast, and that damn creamy-funk corriander aroma, plus some orange peel. Sorry but a big corriander profile is the bane of my beer existance. The taste is of candi sugar sweetness, caramel malt, and spices with corriander being predominate. For a "Grand Cru" there is nothing that exciting about this brew. The feel is moderate with rather soft carbonation resulting in a silky feel. Nice balance between the malt and spices. The flavor doesn't blow me away. Not sure why "Grand Cru's" need to have corriander as their main flavor characteristic.

Initial grainy hop dryness leads to a ripe pear center that explodes with fruitiness. The fruit lingers into a sweet candy sugar and light alcohol finish.

3.77,-7.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Batch # 10. Pours from the bottle a slightly hazy amber-orange hue producing a loosely bubbled off-white and quickly fading head. Aroma is predominantly fruity-sweet and floral with a faint musty/earthy background. Pleasant smells of freshly cut pears,peaches, oranges, bananas and roasted almonds are at the forefront with subtle notes of fresh bread dough, cloves, wet earth, and wheat grass lurking in the background. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and round with a slightly elevated level of carbonation. Flavor profile was a bit more reserved compared to the aromas. Taste was initially fruity and sweet with notes of fresh orange juice, peach and pear upfront with hints of nuts, cloves, caramel malt and coriander making a contribution. Found the finish to be dry but a tad harsh and perhaps astringent. Kind of a odd contrast to the overall sweet and fruity profile of this beer.

Ending is decently dry, with a suble shot of alcohol following the swallow. A tart fruit hits up front but difficult to figure. (???) Budy is refreshing, but also smooth, with a semi-dry finish.

Has a incredible well balanced mix of malt, spices and alcohol. It's 7.2% ABV and a Strong Pale Ale but you never taste the alcohol like some other BSPA's - I'm looking at you Delirium. The mouthfeel was also nice and solid with a creamy texture. Highly, highly recommend - you must try this one. It's a winter seasonal so get at least 2 now.

Very rich malty, sugary aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma although not quite as big and rich, some prune flavor and breadiness with a slight bitter snap of hops and alcohol in the finish. Medium to heavy in body, the smell predicts a much thicker, heavier body, but still fairly chewy. A low level of carbonation and a faint tingle on the tongue with a drying finish.

The tart, crisp, yeasty nature makes it drink like a witbier, but the booze can go to your head. The most disapponting bit is the smell - I can't shake the conception that this smells like overcooked high-protein grains. Most of all, though, if you do pop this bottle, do it at about 55-60 degrees - any colder or warmer and the character is lost.","ojiikun","Jan 03, 2007"

No taste of alcohol. I get some flowery flavors in there as well, along with some critrus hops. Mouthfeel is soft, fluffy, and with a nearly perfect carbonation.

Smell was almost masked by the clean smell of the glass, but the strong fruit aromas came through sure enough, with some spicy clove and other spices in there too. Taste didn't exactly jump out at me, but was quite nice, with more fruit sweetness and a buttery texture. Alcohol could definitely be detected, but was not too overpowering. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and very easy to drink. There was a definite warming factor on this beer, but even so, this beer would be great just about any time of year.

At first theres quite a strong hop bitterness, drying, then buttery, mellow malts smooth it all away before a nice whack of spice through the finish. A myriad of of constantly evolving flavors, apricot, pear, apple, slight citrus pith, faint banana and spices--coriander and white pepper, strong through the finish. Quite complex. Mouthfeel is medium full, just right, with soft fluffy carbonation. Extremely drinkable. This is the first of the allagash lineup i've tried, not sure why i've put it off so long.

Smells of fruits like apple and citrus peel, it is slightly alcoholic and has that distinct aroma of Belgian yeasts. Has a fruity malt flavor, mildly phenolic and subtly spicy, and with a delicate bitter finish. Very smooth in character, somewhat bubbly. The overall enjoyment is quite good to start, but it diminishes some over time.","bennetj17","Jan 05, 2006"

Some breadiness at the end with a peppery tingle in the finish. Low carbonation, but still with a little life to it. The texture was on the creamy side too.

Taste is a light fruity malt with a good deal of spices, apple, pear, orange, mango followed with pepper, cloves, coriander, some slight hops. Nicely flavorful and well balanced, medium/full mouthfeel with a nice refreshing carbonation, this is a really easy drinker.

The taste starts out quite spicy (curacao, clove, corriander, anise), followed by some toasted bread and biscuit malt character, white grape, orange, candied sugar, grassy hops, and a light alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is medium, with crisp carbonation, and drinkability is good. This beer improves dramamtically as it warms, so dont drink it too cold.

Theres definitely some alcohol spice running down the throat, too. Slightly minerally aftertaste  not unpleasant at all. Lingering dull-bitter medicine taste. Intriguing. Mouthfeel is full, bready almost. Increasingly complex as it warms. Drinkability is quite high, because I want to continue trying to figure this one out. A fascinating beer  Ill definitely pick up more of this next time I hit Beers of the World.

4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Served from a corked and caged 750ml bottle, batch number 4. It sits in my orval chalice a medium brown with very clear red highlights around the edges. Much darker than I think of Belgian Strong Pale Ales as this is classified on BA. A medium sized white head forms and quickly fades leaving a filmy coating that remains the whole time. It has a very complex nose filled with a wide variety of aromas that intertwine nicely. A yeast presence dominates, but there is also some spice (pepper), some fruit (plums), some candy (licorice), and a nice malt backbone. The taste is equally complex. The belgian yeastiness dominates in the beginning, but is quickly overtaken by a dark fruity taste....think plums...think candied plums. After the fruit there is a spiciness element caused both by the alcohol and yeast, plus the bottle says it is brewed with spices. I can't pick out the individual spices, but it seems peppery. It finishes with a surprisingly strong hit of alcohol considering it's only 7.2%. A sweetness emerges in the aftertaste, most likely a remnant of the dark fruits noticed earlier and the nice malt base. All of these various flavors meld into a very complex, interesting, and great tasting beer. The mouthfeel is creamier than most Belgian-styles I've tried and it has a typically strong carbonation level. The drinkability must be high because I had no problem finishing the 750ml by myself. I just recently discovered Allagash, but I'm already realizing what a great brewery they are. It's great that there are two breweries making world class Belgian-style beer in the Northeast.","Hagbard","Oct 22, 2005"

4.68,14.7,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Allagash Grand Cru pours a cloudy bronze, capped with an immense, impossibly fine white head that lasts forever. Simply gorgeous. Its smell, malty and spiced, is very good in its own right, but simply does not prepare you for the deliciousness of the flavor. The maltiness, hoppiness, and spicedness complement each other in such a perfect fashion that I'm struggling to put words to it. The mouthfeel is the icing on the cake, light and frothy.

The nose packed a enjoyable punch of citrus and spice...lemon/lime peel, coriander, mushroom, and sweet earthy malt. On the palate, I experienced well-developed flavors of earthy dark sugar malts that were integrated well with restrained spicy accents of coriander, bitter orange peel, indecipherable fruity esters, ripe plantain, and light mollases. A touch of alcohol is noticable in the nicely bittered finish. Lingering bitter orange-peel and pear flavors last past several seconds after the finish. The body was quite thick, but the carbonation countered this, resulting in a feel that went very well with the flavors. Well balanced and and not overly sweet, this was a very drinkable strong Belgian. This Grand Cru is a well done effort, and shows that Allagash is quite competent in delivering good Belgian-style brews.","HiroProtagonist","Mar 27, 2004"

It has a nice little tan head, that sits happily above its rich body. It had a suprising mouthfeel. Thinner than I expected given the smell of it. The taste is remarkable. Smooth, slick little hops peak through the rich malts and esters. The body is great! If it was any thicker, I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much ( or finished the 6 pack). It's wonderful and I reccommend getting your hands on it at any cost. I'm glad I caught it sort of pre-aged as i'm sure it was bottled in the fall.

It smells quite sweet and reminds me of fresh grapes. The taste fulfills the promise that was given in the nose. The beer is sweet, fruity, and has a hint of spice notes. This is a light bodied brew. The alcohol is evident in the finish, though this is in no way distracting. The beer reminds me of fresh sweet succulent grapes. I am not sure why, but it does.

4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle; corked and caged. Batch # 5. Even a careful pour delivers a slightly hazy, copper colored body with bronze and gold highlights. It's full and foamy head of off-white froth wants to leap out of the glass initially, but eventually settles to a creamy 1/2" lid that holds throughout the goblet and leaves excellent lace. The nose is floral with some light citrus; a yeasty spiciness; a touch of mustiness from the cork; and a candyish, honey-like and gently caramelish malt. It's medium bodied, but light and crisp in the mouth due to its very fine, natural, and lightly effervescent carbonation. The flavor is richer than the aroma indicates with a sweet, softly caramelish malt that's accented by yeasty clove and subtle, dried fruit. Notes of white pepper and spice appear mid-palate, (the small bottles are much spicier) probably due to its alchol. The hop bitterness is restrained, allowing the spiciness to balance it; and it finishes with a note of sweet, candyish malt that displays a slight touch of caramelization. This is a really enjoyable, softly malty and not overly-sweet beer that can be sipped slowly or enjoyed with a meal; but the smaller bottles tend to be a bit more abrasive with increased pepperiness and alcohol to them. Regardless, it's a very nice beer in either form.","NeroFiddled","Dec 16, 2003"

Nose is spicy with additional notes of sweetness including marshmallow and caramel. Sweet malt, green raisins and cinnamon also make their presence known. Nose, however, is somewhat restrained overall. Taste is an onslaught of a variety of flavors. At first, dark fruit, allspice, cinnamon, tangy citrus, yeast and malt are all prevalent with a mild hop bitterness present on the finish. A mild alcoholic bite also appears, but the alcohol content is well-masked overall. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and quite elegant overall. This is certainly a sipping delight, and quite easy drinking at that. This beer is quite age-worthy, as some time in the cellar would help to incorporate its complexities even further. Allagash does a wonderful job crafting Belgian-style brews.","Jon","Oct 15, 2003"

Anyways, it's definately a good beer for a cold night. It's got some spices in it that warm you from your stomach upwards. It's a murky amber color with a cream colored head. The head started off strong and went down to a laceing. I could also taste some hints of citrus in it. I like it and it's cheap, so that makes it even better!","JISurfer","Oct 14, 2003"

Batch #4 (Also a blatant attempt to suck up to JohnnyP and bennybrew!) It poured with a dark red/ coppery body, and a fluffy tan head. The aroma was mild, with malt, mild hops, cloves and a hint of coriander. The taste was complex, with malt, raisin, clove, ginger, caramel, burgundy wine, nutmeg, and mayhaps a hint of ginger. All this was overlaid with a mild hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth, with a slight oiliness. It finished with hops, grapefruit, and a hint of malty sweetness.

Varied aromas all hover around a fruity theme -- estery, orange spicy, citrusy, peachy. As it warms a bit more, the peachy/tropical fruits come out a bit more. A little gummy in the nose. A surprisingly dry, phenolic taste that encompasses so much of the flavor. Briefly sweet and almost smokey in its dryness. A distinct movement into a peppery alcohol phase. I think I could have used a little more alcohol and candy-ish sweetness in this beer; the phenolic variety (e.g., a little plastic, a little smoke) was just a bit awkward.

Id heard good things about Allagash, but this was the first beer of theirs Id had the chance to try. Lovely 750ml bottle with a wire-wrapped cork that explodes with the pent-up carbonation. The beer itself is a hazy amber, with a moderately sized, fairly creamy head. Ah, that Grand Cru aroma. Toasty malt, some nice cinnamon and coriander spices, yeast, and some very mild fruit. The beer is decadently creamy in the mouth, very smooth. Flavor starts of candi-sugar sweet, with the toasted malts developing mid-palate along with something like passionfruit. More cinnamon and nutmeg spiciness toward the end, enough so to make up for the lack of much in the way of noticeable hops. The beer leaves an aftertaste which is very husky and surprisingly pleasant. Seamlessly blended and very tasty.","mzwolinski","May 03, 2003"

The taste was great with some serious hops and fruits and subtle notes of honey and maple. It left a great, bitter taste in the back of my throat.

It's a great looking beer, deep copper-orange with a persistent white head that gives to that typical Belgian lace as you empty the glass. There's an in-your-face aspect to the taste that is a bit less subtle than other examples of this style. Is it a hint of grapefruity hoppiness? I don't know, but it's grown on me over the course of this six-pack. Definitely a bready quality to the taste, with hints of spice (a bit of coriander and clove), a little pepper, and some molasses.

Caramel malt is more pronounced that the "norm", adding a richness to the flavor profile. Malt sweetness combines w/ clove and peppery alcohol to from a black licorice mid palate impression. Spices seem to have mellowed somewhat, w/ light herbal notes of citrus peel and perhaps coriander perceptible. Fruitiness is mild, but distincitively date like in nature. Subdued banana esters as well. Becomes progressively more vinous and sherryish in underlying flavor as it breathes. Moderate bodied, yet crisp and light on the palate. Low hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness unhindered. Finishes full circle, w/ fading clove and malt sweetness. Allegash Grand Cru is a unique & delicious brew.
