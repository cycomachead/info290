Being in the Midwest....we do not get Russian River product!  The beer poured a dark amber with foamy head that didn't hang around long, but left some lace.  The scent is typical of Belgian Quads.  The taste was very evenly balanced and probably the best quad I have ever had.  The mouthfeel was full in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall this is a winner.","WoodBrew","Mar 28, 2015"

The aroma is a little more yeasty than fruity and sweet but it is still pleasant. The taste is good but a little mild for me, lacking in the big punch of dark fruit and spice that the style is known for. The body has a nice weight to it, with just a hint of carbonation and alcohol on the finish.","delta490","Mar 25, 2015"

The lightly fruity flavors are dominant but pleasant and slightly sweet. Hints of sherry, black pepper and almond/amaretto on the back end. Solvent alcohols and a slightly astringent and bitter finish. The mouthfeel is below average - thin and undercarbed. Overall, this is an interesting beer with nice belgian yeast notes.

4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/31/2014. Pours fairly cloudy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, golden raisin, banana, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, pepper, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of pear, apple, golden raisin, banana, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, pepper, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, golden raisin, banana, clove, caramel, brown sugar, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 15, 2014"

It lacks a whole bunch of flavours that typical BSDAs typically require though, and falls short in so many ways. Maybe it's the youth of the beer, but this just doesn't cut it for the style, and falls even shorter for a collab between these two breweries who are clearly game changers in the craft beer scene. An expensive letdown. While it wasn't a bad beer, you'd expect much more from this stuff.","tbeckett","Mar 18, 2014"

Heavy hops on the nose, with fruity sweet and some spice on further inhales. The beer has a bold bouqet of flavors that blend together extremely well. Sour backbone, with some spice notes to it, and a huge projection of bitter hops. The beer is forward, strong and full in mouth, but transitions to a surprisingly smooth and crisp finish.

Full-bodied, not quite "foamy" but the carbonation creates a mouthfilling sensation. Sweet, yet, achieves a noticeably dry finish at the same time. Clove, ginger, anise spice, here less overt fruitiness, more raisin, fig with touch of apricot. Yeasty, but raw not bready. Caramel, maple syrup, chocolate powder, maltiness restrained.

The lighter than expected finish certainly helps the sessionability of this beer (in spite of the alcohol content), but the body..thick at first, thin at finish...had me scratching my head.

Notes of honey were also present along with alcohol, ending with a dry finish. Overall, I found the flavor to be overly sweet and syrupy. Mouthfeel was smooth, of medium body and carbonation.

The malt overtones are exceptionally balanced with the hop finish and fruity undertones. The sweet candied hops and fruitiness is nice and made crisp with a nice floral/citrus hop finish. There is some chewy stickiness to this brew which is quite pleasant as the body stays even without too much thickness or syrup. The body of the brew reminds me of apple cider, and even more so as my pint sat and came up to room temperature. The rise in temp also increased the ease with which my pallet could detect a nice hop finish.

I can't say that it wowed me, but it's an interesting combination of styles from two distinctive and excellent breweries. Ultimately, my opinion is simply that each brewery does a better job on their own than in collaboration. This beer pours a lighter than expected though still quite dark golden brown color. The aroma is of nectarines and earthy yeast. The flavor is quite fruity but doesn't pack enough depth for me to really enjoy it. The caramel malt character is good as is the blending of yeast flavors. The flavors just come out a bit too close to a bubblegummy weizenbock for my taste in Belgian ales.

Medium in body, fairly easy to drink if you can adapt to it. I wasn't a big fan of Avery's Salvation, and this one seems to pack a little more flavor and variety in. I think it would do better being a little sweeter, but the nuttiness adds a new dimension to it. Not quite true to Belgian style, but still interesting to try nevertheless.

It tasted like salty lemons and sour orange zest and wild Belgian yeast, with a bit of cream and caramel. Sweet caramel became more apparent as it warmed. It was watery with moderate carbonation, with a smooth tart aftertaste. Overall this was a very sour beer, but it was very clean and well constructed. Definitely more of a Belgian light or tripel than Belgian dark or dubbel, the flavors just never reached that delicious level that I was hoping for. But it had good body and hid the alcohol well.

3.68,-5.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"1 pint and 6 ounce bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. Label reads batch # 3 with a bottled date of February 2009. After the pour, a very small head forms initially and disappears in less than a minute. Little bit of lacing appears as you drink it down but it doesn't really hold on the glass. Beer has a nice light brownish orange color. Thought it was interesting that the color of the beer pictured on the label looked nothing like the actual beer. Smell is yeasty with some citrus and flowery notes. Taste is very, very smooth. Yeasty bread taste dominates and reminds me of a strain of yeast that is common with many belgian brews (not sure what it is though). Beer is well balanced, the hops come through at the forefront and methodically creep away as you make your way to the somewhat dry finish. The hop bite initally appears to be strong but is restrained just enough to make this superbly well balanced. The smooth mouthfeel and well balanced taste make it a beer that you can enjoy again and again. Was hoping for a bit more in this "collaboration" given the quality of many of these brewers' standalone beers but all in all, a solid beer that I would enjoy again. Haven't enjoyed the two Salvation beers from Avery and Russian River but would be curious to see how they compare to this one.","Nick3","Mar 05, 2009"

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Special thanks to Kyle from Gary's in Madison for this one... From what I understand, this beer got its name because both Avery Brewing Co. and Russian River both had beers named "Salvation", so they decided to combine their two beers into this one special brew... The result is a very unique, rich, thick, example of an outstanding beer... Pours a purple, dark, ruby-red hue with minimal frothy head that soon dissipated... Smell was very sweet and rich, with obvious prune, figs, and caramel notes pouring through... Taste strongly complements the aroma, with rich brown sugar, malts, and a distincly sweet honey taste... the dark, dehydrated fruit flavor is really present, and makes itself very well known in this particular brew... overall, the taste was top-notch, a real stand-out... mouthfeel was ultra-rich and creamy and really enjoyable... drinkability was equally very good, and the hefty 8.99% ABV struggles to make itself known behind a wonderful cornucopia of thick and sweet flavors... Definitely recommended...","dsa7783","Feb 03, 2008"

Clarity is excellent, at least to start, and there is a modest carbonation working up. The aroma is a dichotomy between sweet and spicy. There is deep caramel and brown sugar with prevalent fruity esters in there. The spice is almost a little allspice in nature. I think this one smells nice. The flavor is more slanted towards a raisin fruityness and light brown sugar sweetness, with a solid spice that moves into a light bitterness on the finish, along with some distinct "green" flavors from the hop. It is very flavorful, with solid complexity I like the little kick from the hop on the finish that rounds the flavor out. Mouthfeel is thick, with a very light carbonation, almost none at all. This one is deceptive, as it drinks like it is about 6%, but it certainly packs more than that. This one is good.","kmpitz2","Sep 23, 2007"

It smells like sweet sugar and fruits. The smell really lets you know this beer is going to be good. This has a very good taste, with only the slightest medicinal twinge, which doesnt detract from this beer in the least.

There's some mild citrus-peel notes that lend a refreshing bittering sourness to offset the malt monster that this is. Caramel appears again, along with that mild banana flavour. Big bready flavours, yeast, it all points to a delcious piece of cake in your mouth. Belgian sugars and a peppery spiciness back all that up. Not too heavy in the mouth, which is nice and makes the brew slide down nicely, as does the not-overbearing carbonation. Dry and spicy in the finish.

Smell is of fresh malt and bread also a bit of figs and dates in the nose and just a hit of hoppy finish as well. Taste is a bit of malt of upfront with some fresh grapes and also a bit of earth, a little bit of bitterness and a bit of a alcohol burn. This is a extremly good offering and such a great idea of mixing the 2 together, awesome job and hopefully will follow with other great collaborations.","gunnerman","May 06, 2007"

The label had an interesting story of how this beer came together as a collaboration between Avery and Russian River. It had a rich mahogany color that had a 2 1/2 finger head. It slowly settled into a constant foam feed by a steady stream of carb. The aroma was sweet malt with dark fruits and strong yeast. Didn't get much of a hop presence. Had a good balance and wasn't overly sweet like I find some BSDA's. The taste was really good and again had a very great balance. It starts out sweet in the middle of the tongue than the flavor hits the sides and finishes strong without a heavy alcohol presence or too much sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice and solid with a gentle attack of carb to round it out. Overall, I really enjoyed this one which suprised me since I'm finding that I don't like too many BSDA's. This one gets the job done without overplaying the ABV or over-relying on raisins for flavoring like some. Highly recommend. (4, RB, T, Y)","TexIndy","Apr 09, 2007"

The body was a translucent honey-amber with red highlights. The nose was lightly fruity, yeasty, and malty, but not pungeant enough for my preferences. However, the true power of the beer was expressed far more so in the taste, which was rich with dark fruitiness, berries, cherries, a touch of an herbal character, some chocolate, and pepper. It hid the alcohol magnificently. The mouth was medium, with very tiny but many bubbles, which led to great carbonation. I would have liked the body to be a tad thicker, though.

The palate is zesty and light for the style, which is a welcome change from most US Belgians and highlights the strengths of US beers brewed in the Belgian style rather than the weaknesses. After the hops, some slightly sweet malts crop up, but they serve to strengthen the mouthfeel more than they sweeten the palate. Some fruits pop up toward the finish, but they're subdued compared to the hops. Overall, this is quite an interesting beer. It seems to me more comparable to an Abbey dubbel than a strong dark ale -- it's got a dryness that many strong dark ales lack, especially those made in America.

The smell was that of sour cherry, banana, clove, and mandarin orange. The taste was dry, earthy, and spicy, making this quite a departure from the typical Avery Belgians, which I usually find to be floral, and a little sweet. This was quite a yeasty beer, with dusty tongue tingling phenols. The mouthfeel was little thinner than I would have liked.

When all's said and done, the Avery/Cilurzzo detente ends up being an engaging endeavor.","Foxman","0"

This is a fun and enjoyable beer though and a great idea. Hopefully we can see more brewers coming together like this in the future.

4.03,3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer, and I think that it will really benefit from cellaring for a year or two at a cool temperature. Right now it just tastes a bit green and the flavors haven't really melded yet. It is good, and I like the fact that I am supporting Adam, Vinnie, Tomme, Sam and Rob to go to Belgium. It is some gimmick, but I think that all of us beer snobs will benefit from them going on that trip. I will probably pick up a few more to support the effort, and maybe review it again in 2009 or some such.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 19, 2007"

4.05,3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This one pours leaving a thick off white head over a half-inch and it holds well. The beer is a chocolate amber color that that is barely tranlucent with some decent clarity. Spiced aroma of corainder and yeasts, seeming very "authentically Belgian". The first sip starts out very tangy with lots of dark fruit, and then quickly changes to a strong nutty finish. At first the finish tastes like peanut butter, and its very dry, but after a few more sips I realize there is a bit of DMS flavor there perhaps, although this is only a minor distraction. Thankfully, the alcohol is not too overpowering. I enjoyed the full, silky mouthfeel of this beer. Plenty of foamy carbonation. This beer is good, but will probably seem a bit overhyped being partially from Russian River and all. Worth getting a bomber or two, and if you like it get some more...","bennetj17","Feb 06, 2007"

4.08,4.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The mouthfeel is pretty solid with upfront tones of dryness that sets the stage for the rest of its character. Beyond medium in body with barely a slice of dark sweetness to keep it backed up in balance as it stays fairly straight up dry with the yeast and earthy settings. It has a tendency to change its balanace from time to time, especially as it warms, regardless, its heavy ended towards the dry at first so be patient if that's not your thing. But its not overwhelmingly so; its quite manageable really, and a pleasing combo, or blending, of styles that most will like. Quite nice once its been breathing a while.","tavernjef","Jan 23, 2007"
4.51,15.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured a beautiful clear brown with a huge frothy head. Smell was very spicey, grassy and earthy tones with a hint of sweetness. The taste was classic belgian and very nicely done. Fruitness and spices predominate, no hint of alcohol, which at 9%abv is incredible. Really smooth and effortless in drinkability. This is a fantastic brew, way too easy to drink, honestly the easiest 9% I have ever had. This is a must get as it is remarkable.","mikesgroove","Jan 22, 2007"
