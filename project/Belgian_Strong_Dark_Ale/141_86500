3.65,-3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Small head, dark body.  Aromas of dark malt, plums, raisins, and some vanilla and whiskey.  Lots of oak and cola notes with a bit of burnt malt lingering in the finish.  Medium thick body, average carb and a fairly dry finish.  Not bad, but it's a mediocre base beer with a less than stellar barrel treatment, not something that really needed to be made or that I would drink again.","nickfl","Saturday at 02:38 AM"

The liquid is a pure brown color, fairly clear and transparent, curiously there’s a decent amount of beads with tiny, active bubbles. The nose mixes roast and sweetness, cocoa and coffee beans then cola and vanilla, some banana notes in there and has an herbaceous side as well. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has prickle during the mouth entry and then trails off. Vanilla, chocolate, cherry fruit makes it seem like a soft drink. Has that dough and banana element here too. The roast is mostly present as an aftertaste. Pleasant enough, not too sweet, overall though it comes off as flat-footed and one-dimensional.","farrago","Feb 04, 2015"

Aromas of berry fruit highlighting a rich and roasted chocolate backbone. The initial light, fruit sweetness has a great contrast on the nose with the rich sweetness of the backbone. Smells tasty. Flavors of roast, followed quickly by a fruit characteristics that I can only liken to boiling fruit down when you are preparing it for jams or jellies. It's that concentrated sweetness that still has a light characteristic. Again, the fruit has a strawberry/raspberry profile to it, and that is quickly enveloped by a dry roasted and baker's chocolate backbone, with a subtle bitterness that grows into a strong roast and bitter blend in the aftertaste. There are also some boozy qualities in the palate that slowly build, as well as a warmth. This is a dynamic brew, and the layers continue to develop as you drink. Let this one warm in the glass before you drink in order to fully appreciate it. Smooth, dry finish, with a slight bitter chocolate linger. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","May 07, 2013"

Tastes are beautifully complex and balanced with notes of toasted grain, dark fruit - raisin, fig, date, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, some faint coffee, and Belgian yeast. Mouth-feel is full with nice carbonation, while finishing just dry enough for the palate to want another sip. At 8.4%, there actually was better drinkability, as opposed to some higher ABV stouts & strong ales. Overall, I loved it! One of my favorites out of the Big Beer Series.","barnzy78","0"

The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger sense of whiskey. Not much Belgian character is to be found here, at least by my tongue's reckoning. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid beer, though the lack of any Belgian character, the relatively thin feel of the proceedings, and the general lack of complexity in general lead to a kind of nigh-disappointment on my end.

4.17,10,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A dessert beer and one of the best "Belgian" style stouts I've had. Not overwhelmed by yeast notes and carbonation.","Bung","Dec 15, 2012"
3.68,-2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a two inch, fizzy, khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly collapses into a consistent skim. Delicate webs of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses fruity esters as well as a hint of bubblegum and cocoa. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a roasty character to the flavor profile, as well as a slight metallic tinge towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a lively, even carbonation. You don't see too many Belgian Stouts out there, so kudos to Smutty for putting one out. That said, while enjoyable, it's a little bit too fruit forward in my opinion. Nonetheless, a solid effort put forth by one of my favorite breweries.","Jwale73","Dec 15, 2012"
4.39,15.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste starts sweet with caramel and bourbon and then evolves into a moderate lingering bitterness. The wood barrel is more noticeable in the taste than in the aroma. But overall this is a fine beer from Smuttynose.","puboflyons","Dec 14, 2012"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a chalice pretty much black except when held close to the light there is some deep brown that barely shows,a thinner beige head atop.Caramel and toffee notes stick out most in the nose along with some Belgian yeasty spiced notes.A nice mix of earthy roasty stout,vanilla/barrel, and yeasty spiced Belgian Dark on the palate,not overly sweet and it's pretty earthy in the finish.Comparing this to the Thirteenth Hour Stout this wins because it's more complex and not overly sweet,it's just good.","oberon","Dec 10, 2012"

3.38,-10.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not really seeing much of the barrel influence here besides maybe a bit of vanilla and tiny bit of oak.

But it does have enough alcohol and flavor complexity to make up for that and then some. Take it for what it is- a unique take on the Belgian Stout, and one of the most delicious beers around... If you ask me.","j37geogaddi","Dec 01, 2012"

2.68,-29.3,4,3.5,2,2,3,"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. Looks great, smells good, although the hint of cherry gives me a slight foreboding. I drank this while watching the SEC Championship game, and I am a Georgia fan, so that may have colored my impression of the beer, although I tried to judge it objectively. The key words that sum up my experience were thin, sour, and fizzy. These are not features I look for in a stout.","projektyle","Nov 30, 2012"

3.57,-5.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, an interesting take on a belgian style stout that feels more belgian than stout. The barrel notes are almost so subtle that I completely miss them. The alcohol is also not as mellowed as I would expect. Not a bad beer at all, but a bit of a letdown for a favorite style of mine.","Gosox8787","Beers"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a smallish tan head that shows good retention and spotty lace. Smells of roast, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, dark dried fruits, a bit of lactose like sweetness, spicy Belgian yeasty esters, and a mild bit of vanilla. The flavor is actually quite complex. Mild chocolate and dark sugary sweetness up front that is almost immediately pushed aside for some peppery yeastiness. Juicy and lightly tart dark fruits come around next and meld with a bit of chocolate and roast before a touch of vanilla, oak, and ethanol show up. Long lingering sweet tart fruit sugar and chocolate finish last long after every sip. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet sugary mouthfeel. Wow this one impressed me. It might be a hair on the sweet side, but I enjoyed the hell out of this brew.","johnnnniee","0"
4.18,10.3,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall I would like to see this beer a little heavier in body, with a larger percentage (possibly even 100%) aged in bourbon-oak. This is another solid beer from Smutty that I'll definitely buy again, perhaps even age some for half year to bring out more of the chocolate and dark fruit character. Good buy at $7 regardless!","brewtechnik","Nov 28, 2012"

I know only a portion is aged in bourbon barrels, but there really isn't too much of an influence to be found. I'd like to see how the base beer stands up to the barrel aged portion.
