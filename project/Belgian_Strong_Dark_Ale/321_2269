It dissipated to a thin off white ring like lace which retained until about 3/4 through the drink, after which it mostly disappeared. The aroma was my favorite. I first detected brown sugar, followed by chocolate malt, dry fruit and earthy and grassy yeast like aromas. The taste was malty sweet, fruity, spicy, and malty. Most evident was a boozy finish that was dry and felt like a rum and coke. For me the boozy element was a bit too much, which detracted slightly from the other flavors. For this reason I downgraded the taste. The feel was full bodied but mostly drinkable. A low carbonation that nevertheless stings the tongue.","Gajo74","Jan 28, 2015"

It pours deep brilliant amber bordering on brown under a 2” ligntly amber tinted off-white foam cap with a very fine bead. The cap gradually collapses as the bubble gradually grow and collapse, leaving gothic lace patterns on the glass.  Its spicy with a fruity malty sweetness that stops short of cloying. As it warms cherry and plum with a hint of bubble gum become more distinct and prominent with light ginger, cinnamon and a hint of anise coming into focus. The brewer has lightened the body to somewhere around medium so it drinks a lot less hefty than many 10.0% abv beers. The above average carbonation also softens this big beer. The alcohol is smooth and not hot and shows its presence with a gentle warming. An excellent choice for sitting by the fire and relaxing.","pat61","Jan 25, 2015"

Interessting for La Chouffe, reminds me of the typical belgium witbier, this one is very dark, with intense malts till the very end. Taste doesn’t linger too long, carbonation leads to a well balanced taste. Nice fruity, spicy brown character, with a complex but not overwhelming taste.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

4.1,0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/24/2012. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, clove, molasses, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, molasses, brown bread, clove, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, clove, molasses, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and big robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

Spicy and N'Ice perfect timing for an excellent brew, and with it's annual limited production this Limited Edition makes me smile. High ABV ales are tricky, often just a slight "too much" alcohol or a flatness which is often the result, then toss in some thyme and curacao peel and you get a potentially volatile disappointment, not this one. So well balanced for what I call an exotic beer! Pours a hearty bold amber, good and stable head, pleasant smell, and clean finishing taste.

The nose comprises dark wheat, coriander, light mandarin orange, white bread, clove, and light cardboard. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more bread, more orange, some light cocoa powder, some maple syrup, and more cardboard. Something tells me some oxidation had its way with the beer... The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a grainy feel.

Medium-to-full mouthfeel: good levels of carbonation; following the aroma, lots of dried dark fruits (raisins, dates), yeast, cloves, and white-pepper spiciness; a very restrained, intricate Belgian strong, although I wasn't completely taken in by the depths of the malt character; very upfront in its dark fruit character, some spice, but lacking an appropriate level of density at the core; very good, but not nearly as good as many of my favorite Belgian strong ales; still, careful in its presentation considering its youth; just a touch rough around the edges.

Lots of rasins and plums with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, corriander and just a bit of banana and bitter orange peel. It really opens up as it warms and gets almost chewy. I was surprised how well the 10% ABV was hidden. It's a sipper and in a big bottle, but the drinkability was not bad at all.

Medium bodied and a bit more carbonated than I woudl like but that can be rectified by letting it sit a minute, which is fine as I was drinking the 750 on my own with Xmas eve dinner. I was able to do this just fine, so drinkability is fine but I woudl have just had a 330ml bottle had I known it was just goign to be me drinking this bottle.

3.38,-17.2,2,4,3.5,2,3.5,"N'Ice Chouffe pours a very deep brown, with just the faintest cherry outline when held directly to light. The bone colored head is somewhat muted, and while retention is OK lacing is nonexistent. The predominant flavors I'm getting in the nose are a semi sweet milk chocolate and a bit of orange, not a bad combination. The flavor does show some variety. On different sips I find notes of mild milk chocolate and sweet dark fruits up front. On the spice end the orange peel works really well, and the thyme melds together somewhat with a kick of clove from the yeast. All in all though the spice flavors tend to drown out the malty ones a bit too much, I feel like this beer's underattenuated. That concern carries across into the mouthfeel, where the body is surprisingly thin for a 10%ABV beer. This only accentuates what I feel is a carbonation level that is a bit too high. The somewhat fizzy nature does become distracting at times. The alcohol is fairly well hidden in this beer, but all in all there's not really anything to recommend it over plenty of other Belgians.","axeman9182","Dec 17, 2010"

The aroma is sweet, vinous, with a bit of peppery spice, typical BSDA. Deep red wine, perhaps some sherry, flavors hit up front with a nice counter-balance of dark candi-sugar, some lights hints of tobacco or an earthy spice. There is a bit of a weird sourness or bitterness to this that I cannot quite place. The feel is moderate with plenty of carbonation, some fusel alcohol is present; though sweet overall finishes with a dry and bitter kick. A nice BSDA, nothing from this brewery disappoints. The brew is a bit boozy and dry/bitter for the style. Still a good pick up.","Gmann","May 27, 2009"

Carbonation is almost undetectable, a quality that fits this beer well, and something that I feel gives the impression of a heavier body. As aforementioned it slightly warms the mouth and the throat as it goes down. This brew's got a dry finish with some peppery spiciness to it. This is one that I'll have no problem finishing, I look forward to it. As a matter of fact I think that I might just add this to my line up of brews to go with Thanksgiving dinner. Its that good, this is the first time I've had it and I'd really like to see how it goes with dinner tomorrow. Very drinkable, and one of the most unique Belgian Strong Darks that I've ever drank.

The flavors were distinctly sweet and pungent, big caramel malt, toffee, black cherries, hints of coffee, dark fruits, light chocolate, hints of white pepper, some wood and at the very end I got tart yeast. The 10% was well-concealed but it did make itself present in a bourbon-like way. Generally sweet but not quite cloying.

A noticeable hotness on the nose and tounge, but it is to be expected as it comes in at 10% abv. However, unfortunately this all breaks down rather quickly into an off, highly medicinal taste that lingers. This also hurts the drinkability for me because of said aftertaste.

It does add interesting notes to the beer but also obscures some of the classic Belgian flavor. It's a good seasonal Belgian but it's compared against all BSD's, so that's a bit rough. The beer pours a lovely dark brown with a puffy head. The head dissipates a bit too quickly for a higher score. The nose is malty and earthy. It's an excellent strong Belgian flavor. There's plenty of spice and funky earthiness in the flavor. There's some interesting bitterness, which may be a product of the curacao, and is welcome.","popery","Nov 16, 2008"

The beer does not have much of a head, some retention, not much lacing. The smell is candied sugars, caramel, some roasted malts, sweet malts, caramel, some berry or orange notes as well. The beer is a lot more light bodied than I would have predicted. It is still a medium bodied beer, but not as syrupy as a Belgian 10% ABV ordinarily would be. The taste is typically Belgian in that you will get the candied sugars, the big sweet malt tastes, warming alcohol notes, and some pepperishness in the finish. There are definitely discernible spices to this beer. I'm noticing orange rind, clove, maybe some allspice or cardomman. The downside to the beer, for me, is the throaty burn in the finish. I like my beers smoother, creamier, and less alcoholy than this one. But, at a 10% ABV, some of this is to be expected.

The thyme gives the beer a more earthy note that plays of the sweetness nicely. Spicy and a bit rummy, like a good fruitcake. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated, and it could be a touch creamier.

I really enjoyed the way it started soft & full and finished in more of the typical Belgian style. Definitely a nice sipper for a cold winter's evening & a beer that can hold up to at least a few years of aging. This would pare nicely with a milder Bleu or a nice dry Cheddar, perhaps even Cotswold & the like. While I'm sure there are number of food offerings that would be nice (they would need to have some zest or spice to them) I feel that this one might be best enjoyed as a sipper. I will definitely make a point of visiting the Choufee gnomes every December. Recommended with no hesitation.","BuckSpin","Dec 26, 2007"

A fair amount of malts to the nose, with some roastiness and spiciness. The taste is quite good. Fairly full bodied with a hint of roastiness to the strong malts. Not real sweet, but nicely balanced.

At first there was a pretty good volume of foam, but it passed out quickly. The aroma was sweet malt and spicy spices (guessing thyme and curacao peel from the label). The taste was about as complex as any I've had, lots of competitions between sweet malts, tangy citrus, bitterness and sweetness and spices (maybe add coriander to the previously listed ingredients). Very very nice, and perfect for Christmas Eve.","TurdFurgison","Dec 24, 2007"

The nose is spicy and of slight dark fruit. Raisin and date. Taste is a similar to gulden, but with more spice and less strength. dark fruit flavors with some orane and spice flavoring. slight hop finish, aftertaste fades quickly.

Ingredients include sugars, thyme and curacao. Hazy reddish dark brown colour, huge tan head. Pleasant but fairly moderate aroma with vinous notes, notes of oak and spices, hints of farmhouse. The flavour is distinctly spicy and oaky, with a substantial but not overwhelming sweetness from the malts and sugars. Some yeasty notes. Distinct hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Warming mouthfeel, but the 10% ABV does not dominate. As a Christmas beer, this one is better suited to accompany an English Christmas pudding than a main course of meats or fish - but is also nice to drink on its own.","Sigmund","Oct 18, 2007"

Lacing is also quite excellent. I don't get a lot on the nose, maybe some cola/rootbeer (again) and belgium spice. On the palate this beer is very rich and warming, with flavors of sweet malt, melon, cherry, maple syrup and butter. The beer is pretty sweet, but not overly so, and the beer is quite sublime. This beer is incredibly soft and smooth on the palate, with no rough edges. The finish is quite long and the mouthfeel is pure silk.

The subtleties of dark fruit and spice emerge mid-palate, with a good bit of holiday spice coming through.

The head is a nice mocha color and maintains its shape and presence the entire session. The aroma is one that I cannot say I have come across before. A very herbal and horse blanket nose makes you wonder how it will taste. The taste is a little overpowered with the earthy, herbal presence. I like how the herbs mix with the sweetness, but it still seems a bit odd to me. The candied sugar doesn't come out until it warms up a bit. When it was just below room temp, this beer seemed to really pull together. The sweetness of the sugar balances well with the rough and earthy body. The high abv is very well hidden, but like LaChouffe, this one creeps up on you and spins your mind in circles. Drinkable....yes, but not more than a bottle here and there.

Some light spices and a big candy sweetness come out right away. A few other light scents in the background but the sugary smell seemed to drown them out for the most part. Plenty of sugary sweetness up front on the flavor with a decent bit of chocolate and spice to try and balance it out. There are also some fruity notes as well. Finishes up with a lightly spicy and sugary flavor. Seemed a bit thin at times but overall pretty solid and smooth. The sweetness got a bit cloying by the end of the bottle but it went down fairly easily. One glass of this would have been ideal the 750 tended to wear me down with the sweetness.

The first glass was a bit too cold so I let it sit. Too cold and this seems to have a little carbonation bite also. Once warmed the carbonation smooths out and the over ripened banana flavor and aroma is predominant. The the finish is a bit dry and a little bitterness attacks the back of the tongue. A spice flavor awakens as this one warms and, at 10 abv , I tought the alcohol was well hidden. I paired this with some homemade sweet dough bread and cheese and it turned out to be a good match.

Very tempting aroma features an orgy of overripe bananas, dates, apricots, and orangepeel, enhanced by spicy coriander, orangezest, thyme, and white pepper. Burnt candy sugar aromas add to the attraction. Mouthfeel is excellent, with effervescent carbonation as per style, and a smooth and creamy medium body that has both a spice and alcohol bite. Taste has the character of an orange liqueur, spiced with thyme and clove, and blended with pureed prunes and raisins. Lots of dark fruits stewed in rum, thrown into the middle. Toward the finish, it gains some dry and bitter hop and yeast character, as if some juniper flavored, Dutch Jenever was added to the mix. Very warming alcohol notes are in the dry aftertaste.

The froth is bolstered by innumerable miniscule bubbles rushing past a few particles of sediment through liquid the color of stained cherry. Garnet highlights and vinous viscosity make this a looker for sure. First impressions in the nose are of freshly chopped coriander, though not overwhelming nutmeg and mallow. Fresh and leafy/botanical nosefeel somehow ends up suggesting... root beer! Must be the candi sugar. As the beer warms, I start detecting a smell like pink erasers--not unpleasant, but weird. Tastes strongly of root beer with tangy spices--mostly tarragon at first--but later the thyme starts to dominate the entire profile. The beer gets powerfully herbal, almost like bay; very round and bitter in the finish. Rather light on the palate, considering the strength of the spices. Alcohol is so well hidden that this is practically slammable. Probably best for knocking someone out before bedtime. At least that's what it did to me.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Jan 26, 2005"

Nice dark brown colour thats red when held to the light with a ton of foam and a little lacing. Smells like brown sugar, some malt, oranges and some spices. Tastes similar to it smells with a sweetness presumably from the candi sugar coming through, with a nice spiciness to it and an orange zest aftertaste. Very fullbodied, and the 10% ABV is very well hidden. I think the drinkability on this is high, could easily finish off a 750 ml, probably another too.

The taste left me in wonder, for I kept thinking it had a cola taste. After thought, perhaps its the thyme over citric spice backed by a sweet carameled malt. That may sound complex but thats what I got out of it. The mouth is left slick with like a hop oil glaze on the lip. The drinkability is smooth for this 10% abv brew.

Some light hops also detected. This smells like a quality brew. Head settles down, leaves scattered lacing. Mouthfeel is smooth, a medium body that has a crisp finish. This may be the best Belgian winter seasonal I've had yet. Flavor is not complex yet very drinkable and enjoyable. Alcohol not detected in flavor or aroma. A malty delight with flavors of sweet malt, candy sugar, citrus and belgian yeast. Thyme comes through in aroma as the warming process continues. This is an excellent winter ale, one to try if you haven't yet.","BierReise","Jan 15, 2004"

4.3,5.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Just plain solid. From the bottle with it's Hobbit type creatures to what is within, this is a great seasonal. Cellaring? If you count my stomach! Pours brownish red. The taste is candy, orangey and malt. Not overly sweet, just the right amount. An excellent beer.","bewareOFpenguin","Dec 22, 2003"
4.55,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"2002 edition. Poured chestnutty brown with frothy tan-colored head it the La Chouffe tuliped goblet. Top notch lacing, beautiful. Pruney, raisiny, malt aroma with a mix of mandarin zest and musty, yeasty notes. Smooth texture from the subtlized carbonation. Malty and rich; beautiful, soft spicing round out a nice sweet and sustained finish. So many flavors going on in this beer it's rather hard to describe. Spiced, candied dates with orange zest on them. Quite the delicacy of a winterbeer.","crookedhalo","Dec 19, 2003"
3.75,-8.1,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"2003 limited edition. Pours a dark cloudy brownish red with persistent carbonation and a soft white head. Aroma full a fruity esters. Apples, pears, some slight biscuity malt in the aroma. Taste is heavy on the spice and alcohol. There is some malt and a hefty dose of orange peel. Very heavy on the fruity esters. Alcohol warms in the finish leaving your tongue dancing. As with other beers from this brewery, it seems a little thin tastewise. Too much fruit & spice, not enough malt. This is a good warming belgian, but lacking in the "meat & potatoes" department. Soft dry mouthfeel and fairly drinkable at 10%. Worth a try, but not the best.","avylover","Dec 16, 2003"
4.07,-0.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Flavor matches the aroma with fruitcake and spices and a growing soapy taste that leads to a finish that has a long drying tannin like a chew on a cinnamon stick with a final warming alcohol through to the gullet.","drewbage","Dec 12, 2003"

N'ice Chouffe is a dark brown colour, very nice (n'ice?) It smelled a bit fruity, alcoholic too. Tasted fruity also, I didn't taste the alcohol too much actually, just a bit. The spices were different, I thought it was a great blend of flavours. Mouthfeel was good, on the thinner side and pretty carbonated, I could've drank more than the glassfull I had that night, definitely.. :)","erica","Dec 09, 2003"
4.15,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is another lovely brew from the Chouffe brewery in Belgium. A nice x-mas scene with the people of Chouffe village adornes this 750ml brown glass bottle that is crowned, but not corked. The pour yields a lovely dark reddish/brown liquid with a tan head of foam. Aromas of alcohol, fruits, spices, and malts/yeasts abound. The taste is lovely. Dry, fruity, boozy, and complex....a fine tipple on a harsh winters evening. The mouthfeel is very full, yet not cloying...and the drinkability is very good...","francisweizen","Dec 09, 2003"
4.7,15.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Easily my favorite Chouffe beer. I just have to get some to cellar before this winter is over, I can only imagine how this would taste with a year or two under its belt.","ViveLaChouffe","Dec 07, 2003"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The 2002 is good to go right away if you see it on the shelves of your local beer store. But dont believe the label hype about Cellaring  this beer is at its best around 2 years old and starts to head south after 3-4 years, sometimes quickly in my experience. It is better "fresh" I think.","TheLongBeachBum","Nov 18, 2003"
4.22,3.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"An interesting holiday beer, and a fine artisanal creation, though not as intriguing to my palette as it was for my brain. Didnt come together as nicely as each part is well on its own. Still tasty enough to be highly drinkable.","nomad","Nov 04, 2003"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is wonderfully balanced and extremely complex. The curacao that they use in the brewing process ads a particularly inviting dimension to the ale. The fine Belgian yeast stands out in my mind as exceptional, and I really enjoy the way that the sweetness moves in and out of the flavor profile. This is an incredible beer!","RoyalT","Sep 20, 2003"

4.15,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Barlet Wine Style, really? I thought it was a damn nice dubbel. Pours a perfect reddish brown, with a tan head that slowly faded to a 1/4 inch and held. Very nice lacing. The smell was that of sour cherries and spices, and tha taste matched, with a nice alcohol finish. Very warming as it went down, but not over powering. A spicey yet sparkling carbonated mouthfeel, with a dry finish. Very nice and for me, very drinkable. I was aware of the 10% alcohol, but the taste took over, and had quite a few. One of my favorite Holiday Ales.","HopheadEd","Feb 04, 2003"
3.83,-6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This was my New Year's Eve beer, served in a champagne glass of course. A pretty good way to end the year! Pours a dark reddish-brown with a medium thin light beige head. Lacing is pretty good. Aroma of herbs and berries. Flavor is a rich medley of fruit, alcohol and a little malt. Very good!","Dogbrick","Jan 15, 2003"
4.08,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Brownish-amber in color with a huge off white head that lasts. Smell is mild with hints of something sweet. Spicy upfront then changes to something peppery in the end. Small hints of some deeper flavored berry as well. The alcohol is well balanced but still lends that warming feeling as you drink. Unlike any other Barley-Wine style ale that I have had but would like to try it again. Maybe after a year of aging.","CharlesRiver","Dec 29, 2002"
4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown with reddish hues, and somewhat hazy. Half-finger head. Aroma is subtle for the style, with mild spicy (thyme-like) and fruity (raisin, some apple) aromas. The flavor, however, is big malt all the way. Very sweet, with again some fruity notes mid-palate. Significant alcohol warming and a pleasantly hop bitterness, though not enough to stop the finish from being just slightly sweet. Medium bodied.","mzwolinski","Dec 26, 2002"
4.64,13.7,4,5,4.5,4,5,"Garnet hue w/ a light haze, covered by a light beige, fluffy, persistent, very dense head. A waft of sweetly herbal fresh thyme is perceived at first in aroma, then notes of citrus rind and mellow chocolate ensue. As the beer breathes, dark, fructose laden date and raisin like fruitness surfaces along with nostril tingling peppery alcohol. Malt becomes more pronounced as well, with dark caramel and hints of breadiness rounding the aroma out. A pleasure to inhale. Flavorwise, this beer starts out like a Belgian Dark Strong. Dryish, powered cocoa chocolate sweetness hits the palate at first, but this flavor profile takes a wild, but enjoyable turn towards herbs and citrus. Well calculated fresh thyme complements the slight raisiny, dark caramel malt foundation, and melds with both dried orange peel citrusy flavors and bitterness. Mellow chocolate malt is not far behind, then combines mid palate to leave a milk chocolate dipped, candied orange peel impression. Fruity esters are well integrated, being comprised of mild notes of barely ripe pear and plums. Light to medium in body, well attenuated, yet very smooth after the initally high CO2 level dissipates, with a deceivingly crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Hop bitterness, although paltry, provides contrast to the mostly dark caramel malt derived sweetness. Finishes paradoxically dry, yet long and complex, w/ hints of clove, bread and butter simulatenously lingering. Delicious! This is the 2002 release... I can only imagine what a couple years of cellaring could do. N'Ice Chouffe is easily the most drinkable high gravity brew I've tasted. Deceptively soft all around. It's amongst the most complex beers I've had the pleasure of drinking as well, even this young. It's very unique, creative and satiating; like many other Belgians, however, it's potentially dangerous in drinkability. It seems that this brewery can do no wrong.","marc77","Dec 03, 2002"

4.15,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a foamy light tan head that left circular lace. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and raisins. A flavor of malt, toffee and raisins with hint of other spices. A finish that is a touch bitter and has the warming aspect of the alcohol.","Wildman","Nov 29, 2002"
4.28,4.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a murky reddish-brown, with a huge, big-bubbled head. I had to wait for the head to settle on this on before beginning. Head faded quickly to a fine lace. Spicy and somewhat hoppy aroma with a big toffee malt presence with hints of grape and raisin. Vinous and bitter taste, with a spice presence and plenty of toffee and raisin flavors mixed in. Slightly dry finish, with a spicy and fruity aftertaste. Smooth and chewy mouthfeel. One excellent winter brew!","Viking","Nov 26, 2002"

4.19,2.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Just found a bottle with a vintage date of 1996 on neck of the bottle. Dane from B. United told me a while ago to open it soon because it loses carbonation. He was right, now it has no carbonation at all. A shame really because this would have been a beer of greatness if it had only held on the carbonation. Goes down like a tawny port with fruity aromas and flavours of currants and cherries. Creamy mouth feel glides over the tongue, alcohol is warming but has mellowed for sure but still with a touch of peppery spice. Oddly there is barely any oxidation from the 6+ years of aging.","Jason","Mar 10, 2002"
