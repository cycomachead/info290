Each sip had sensory distortion as the aroma coming up through my tulip glass just blasted me with herbs and kept the overall experience out of synch. Gotta support the cause and the craft beer movement, but these misses are like collateral damage in the war to keep the beer machine flowing. One and done on this collaboration.","CHickman","Feb 13, 2015"

Because of the herbs I paired it with a pesto chicken pizza with red peppers and goat cheese. While this pairing looked good on paper, I'm not sure it was really the best idea. It turns out, the flavor of the beer is so interesting that I almost forgot that I was eating pizza. I noticed the rosemary first, and then a sort of sweet citrusy flavor which gave way to an herbal/hoppy bitterness. While the flavor was unique and memorable, it wasn't so overpowering (as many of these "experimental" brews can be) that I wouldn't be happy drinking more than one of these in a sitting.","Sokool","Feb 02, 2013"

Smell is very good with a firm pale malt body and a caramel honey sweetness. Some of the usual Belgian funk and yeast esters. The signature spices are not shy here with the rosemary being the biggest player. Taste has more of the spices up front with a grassiness from the parsley and sage flowing in the malt. Strong almost grapefruit like bitterness seems to be from an equal amount of hops and spice blend that covers the aforementioned citrus. Finish is spicy and hoppy with a touch of mint. Light tingley feel is crisp and highly drinkable. An interesting take on one of my favorite styles.","scootny","Dec 30, 2012"

Pleasant aroma of bready malt and Mediterranean herbs, especially sage with a hint of saison yeast. Flavor is citrus, bready malt, nicely herbal with distinct sage and rosemary, finishing slightly dry with lingering herbs, light hops and saison yeast. Medium bodied. Very nicely made and enjoyable. Maltier and more heavily herbal than traditional for the style, but worked perfectly for me. This is the last of the three versions I've tried and I'm interested to see from past reviews how much more I like this than the first I tried (Victory). I'll have to start the cycle again with the Victory version, because the higher ratings of the last two are more likely due to my increasing enjoyment of saisons.","LiquidAmber","Nov 14, 2012"

I really enjoyed the different components, but at least on the palate it didn’t mesh perfectly—in the end it had a little too much herbal-medicinal bitterness on the finish that I think could have gone in a different direction if done a little differently. Now I just need to try the red wine barrel aged version . . .","fmccormi","Oct 11, 2012"

The aroma is very intriguing, strong herbal notes of rosemary and thyme along with other earthy and fruity notes, light citrus. Taste is equally as intriguing. All of the herbal flavor comes through right up front with more notes of pine and very slight citrus flavor. There is a lingering sweetness, as well as a slight hop bitterness, very well balanced, clearly the herbs are the star of this beer. Medium carbonation and medium body with good mouthfeel. This really is a good beer, however it's just so different. I don't know if I'm ready to commit to have this on multiple occasions, but it's definitely worth picking up just for the experience. The BUFF trio really are trying to push the envelope as far as developing new beer trends, and this is an excellent example.","scvance","Sep 05, 2012"

When I opened the bottle and smelled what was in there I knew that this would be quite different from beers I've previously tasted. It's a clear see through gold liquid that adopts the colors of whatevers behind the glass. It smells like a garden. The aroma of the herbs blend together to make this smell like a flower garden. The smell alone is relaxing and can take you to a different place. The taste is very unique. I noticed the bottle doesn't say beer anywhere but malt beverage. The flAvor of he herbs has a stronger accent on the overall taste than most recipes that you'd see them in. This is fine and pleasant in this case because they're guided by the light malt and carbonation that present the herbs to your tongue. The herbs still gently tingle on your tongue after a sip. Is a very nice beer for relaxing on a quiet day.","tilopud_rye","Jul 12, 2012"

3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from bottle to tulip the beer arrives a brilliant golden color, fairly opaque in nature, with a decent 1.5 finger white head, good retention and lacing. Fairly translucent. The nose is an aggressive blend of peppery lemon, yeast, and herbs. Similarly the flavor is a punch of lemony pepper, yeast and then an abundance of sage, allspice, rosemary spice. Different, aggressive but not overly so. Mildy bitter and fairly clean. Not much hop character. Finishes a bit thin in nature with a lingering herb flavor. Overall, glad to have tried it. Might go well with a rosemary lemon pepper chicken? I enjoyed it but likely won't be back.","hopfacebrew","May 10, 2012"

Regardless, this is a very drinkable, delightful beer that I'd like to see in bombers.

Also there is a layered hint of belgian yeast spice as well. The mouth brings all the herbs together which is impressive to taste all the flavors thats its made with though to me thats not a good thing as im not the biggest herb fan in the world. Coriander sings first, with sage coming in right behind it holding till the end - with a wisp of rosemary showing itself in the middle.

Tasty is both hoppy and herby and considering it has a spice cabinet of parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme in it no wonder. Finish is too bitter. I'm not sure where they get off calling this a saison because the flavor isn't really from the yeast or malt so much as the spices and although other saison's might have zest or peppery spicing they don't go down the savory route like this example. Saisons are supposed to be refreshing beers brewed for farm hands whereas this is more of a savory broth I'd target to the autumn.","MoreThanWine","Jun 28, 2011"

Very strong smell--a bit like Bell's Hopslam, oddly, with only a few herbal saison notes that I'm picking out. Pleasant enough. Smells like it'll get a lot funkier as it warms, and is pretty nice. Tastes good, love what they did with the style/creativity. Mouthfeel is absolutely awful and inconsistent. Drinks smoothly on a nice spring-like day.","afausser","Feb 17, 2011"

Aroma is golden malts coupled with a heavy helping of both rosemary and sage, which imparts a sweet and zesty quality. The parsley and thyme are much less forward. Flavor is very similar. Very herbal and green with a flabby pale malt baseline. Finishes dry from tannic astringency and I'd be lying if I said the high carbonation wasn't distracting.

Flavor wise I got pretty much the same thing a big old herbal mess not to much Saison flavoring going on. In other words a little bit of herbs go a long way.

Super-focused citric-herbal flavor without a tremendous amount of nuance, but what's there is delightful: tangerine and grapefruit laden with holy basil and kaffir lime, purple sage and lemon thyme, round and meandering yet somehow snappy and focused.

Huge sage presence (reminiscent of the Russian Sage growing in my garden), as well as rosemary and a suggestion of citrus. Taste follows nose - extremely herbal and slightly bitter and acidic. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands - finish is semi-dry. An interesting beer, but herbal qualities are a bit overpowering.

Poured hazy golden yellow orange with a massive four finger head that came right to the brim of my tulip and settled down to two fingers very very slowly. The head also had a nice fluffy/pillowly appearance to it. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtle hop, banana, subtle oregano, and other spices. The flavor was of spices, bitter malt, slight hops, and subtle fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall it takes a little bit for your palate to adjust to it, but once it does the flavors are very nice. The only downside is that it has too many flavors going on at once rather than having them come on individually from each other to keep changing my palate. It almost seems to explode.

Rosemary up front and thyme finishing on the back end. In the middle is lemon grass. Very herbal. Light on the hops, light on the malts but huge on the spice cabinet. The mouthfeel is a bit disappointing. It finishes really full and sweet. Saisons should finishes at least somewhat dry. This one should have fermented out just a little more.

Good lacing...Aroma is heavily loaded with rosemary, but has a real Tuscan shape to it overall. Kind of like the spice that makes a good fricasse...Some citrusy notes in there too, keeping with the style. Not bad but I'm not a huge herbed beer guy...Flavor is very herbal. Lots of the Thyme, sage, rosemary notes but I'm not getting the parsley. Very good mouthfeel, and the carbonation is nice. Very bitter, in a bad way, on the finish. The herbal notes don't diminish at all. Well-priced at $2.99/12oz. bottle, though, so that brings the drinkability up. A light-bodied and crisp ale, but not really sessionable because the herbal notes are overpowering. They likely accomplished their goal with this, but it's not up my alley.

It was a light yellow color with a big bubbled head that dissolved quickly - looked like it had some fizz to it. Flavor was nice and fruity, dominated by big herbal flavors of rosemary and possibly other. Not surprisingly there's a bit of Stone hoppiness, orange, some yeast and wheat in there.

Medium-bodied, nicely balance with same amount of fullness from start to finish. The herbs once more dominate and there is a clear, strong note of basil as well. Nothing crazy about the carbonation level but it does add to the total cleanliness factor. The tangerine to pink and white grapefruit lend a sweet and sour juiciness.

Unusual, and I kind of like it. Taste was not as overpowering as the smell may suggest. All of the flavor profiles of a well built saison were there, including hay and fresh bread. The herbs were pronounced on the palate but added to the unique flavor of this beer. Mouthfeel for this beer was also quite good, as it had the tart crispness of a farmhouse ale.

It pours an almost clear, somewhat hazy golden straw topped by a more-than-healthy couple fingers of white froth. The nose comprises a dichotomous mixture of wheat and citrus assaulted by a a horde of window-box garden spices (must be the S&G "Canticle" spices). The spices return to dominate the tongue as well, providing more than enough garnish for the dish, both literally and figuratively. Some citrus flies in behind them, but this is quickly quashed by a strong earthy/spicy collaboration. Still, though, the herbs/spices maintain their iron-clad grip on the situation. This is the first time I've experienced a sammich's filling be completely o'ershadowed by the bread. Honestly, I think I find it a bit too much. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I gotta say I am underwhelmed by this brew.

Aroma is very crisp and fresh, dominated by herbal and floral notes with mild citric hops and slight medicinal pinch. Appearance is a clear golden amber color with a massive foamy and rocky white head that leaves billowy patches of lace and a persistent thick layer of film and bubbles with a large foamy splotch in the middle. Given the description of ingredients for this beer, the flavor isn't very surprising, but certainly isn't a let down as this is very unique; but is it any good? Front of the palate is gripped by a citric, almost DIPA like flavor, though not remotely bitter. Moving back the palate a unique, musty earthiness dominated by herbal and floral flavors. Body is medium thick, mildly creamy, with strong fine carbonation that tries to clean up some of the sweet and herbal mess of the body. Very little about this beer makes me think of a saison, and I'm usually not crazy about herbal and medicinal flavors, but I'm strangely enjoying this beer. The only thing detracting from the drinkability of this is the long lingering dry aftertaste that is dominated by sage and other earthy spices.

2.5,-34.2,3,3,2,4,2,"Sure, this beer is innovative (although Right Brain Brewery did a better version last year) but the flavors just don't mesh too well. The rosemary, sage and thyme are nice, but I swear the parsley (which dominates with grassy chlorophyll) was just thrown in to match the Simon and Garfunkel song. And, while I generally love saisons, the slight sourness makes everything even more confusing.

The aroma has some fresh hay and bread dough upfront, along with white pepper, floral hops, spices (thyme, rosemary, parsley), a little honey and mineral. The flavor is similar to the aroma with biscuit and hay initially, along with some white pepper, spicy hops, rosemary, sage, cardamom, a little honey, some fruity esters and a little alcohol.

Citrus and fruit aroma, lots of oranges and grapefruit, pineapple, powdery, peppery, a little bready with mild cloves and alcohol. The flavour is cleaner than the aroma, but a little less intriguing for it. The same character is present - citrus and tropical fruit, crackery malt, light spiciness - just a little more subdued. Lingering fruit. Mild warmth as it goes down. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry, a little creamy, nice texture overall. I liked this quite a bit.

For the profile, they could have used practically any other yeast, the saison character is just whelmed here. Sweetness is (thankfully) low, there's a little honey present. Somewhere in there, there's some ripe orange. Drying and bitter on the finish, there's a fair hop character too. Carbonation is high, making this crisp on the palate. Despite the flavors, this is just a touch watery too. Very herbal. Interesting, unique, but not something I'm interested in revisiting.

3.95,3.9,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Overall: If you've never had a 'spice, herb, or vegetable' beer this is a very good place to start. The beer nicely demonstrates that herbs normally thought of solely for cooking, can be successfully applied in brewing. The hop bitterness and flavor are surprisingly high considering they're not recognizable in the aroma. In fact I wouldn't mind if the hops were backed off a little to Ellet the spices come through even more.","DanOLeary","Jun 23, 2010"

4.19,10.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured this into a tulip. Not as much head on this straw colored beer as I though there would be. About a fingers worth of head and decent lacing. Smells great. just like a fresh herb garden. The thyme is really what shines through the nose along with citrus and a bit of a spicy kick. I don't really taste the herbs as much as I thought I would but this hopped up saison hits the pallet nicely. Fresh hops and spices all across my tongue. The carbonation takes away a bit on the mouth feel for me. I guess I would like a little less but this light bodied beer is a great summer time treat. This drinks easy, especially due to the great flavor and aromas.","Bendurgin","Jun 22, 2010"

3.73,-1.8,4.5,4,3.5,3,4,"woah! weird beer, but i guess they meant to create something avant guarde... it's hard to rate because for a saison, it is completely out of the box. interesting. kind of awesome. not what i was expecting. of course. burnt gold with an off-white head that holds well and leaves tons of lace. very pretty. earth (dirt) and herbs hit me first in the nose, followed by lots of lemony, grapefruity, orangey hops that are boosted by a sweet malt, and maybe some salt and pepper in the background. taste is bitter sweet herb hop with a bitter finish that sings with pepper and lemon basil. like drinking a sweet, hoppy ipa in the garden and a little dirt and some of your cooking herbs got in the glass. well-balanced though and ti seems to kind of work. here's where it gets tough to review... mouthfeel. i like my saisons much, much, much more well-attenuated. i want them dry and crisp (it does come off pretty dry in the end, but there is sweet all over the place in this beer and the slickness of the mouthfeel is easy to misperceive as sweetness or fullness), and i want the herbs and spices (if there are any) to be subtle and mysterious. not muddy... mysterious (think fantome). the psr&t do play with the other ingredients in du buff, and they do help to amplify the desirable flavors, so this is kind of cool, they just stand out a little too much in their own little corner. mouthfeel is a little too full for me and carbonation is too low, although i guess the really old saisons were more lightly carbonated, so who knows?... easy to drink. lots of fun food pairing options here. old-school saisons are in and hopped up belgian style beers are cliche. come on guys! what happened to being ahead of the curve?","timtim","Jun 19, 2010"

I love the concept of these collaborations, but usually I find that the sum of the parts isn't as good as the parts themselves...seems more like a marketing and community thing than about making a great drinkable beer.

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy honey straw color with a tall soapy pure white head that slowly settled into a slight cap leaving some webby lacing. The aroma is strong with grassy/floral hops, light herbs, pepper, and a spot of lemon. The flavor starts off with the grassy hops, fairly strong. The herbs definitely come out in the second wave, though no specific one really stands out. The candi sugar sweetness (?) and yeasty phenols keep the herb flavor subtle. There is a strong pepper flavor as well. The feel is light but no where near watery, solid carbonation, has a bitter edge but finishes sweet. An odd saison, very hoppy for the style, which probably masks some of the other flavors. Good base saison flavor and perhaps the hops helps keep the herbs in check. I would like to see a touch less hops, though it is a nice profile, and a touch more yeasty phenols.","Gmann","Jun 15, 2010"
4.23,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours straw yellow with a haze from yeast, smells of sage and rosemary or a herb garden.

4.12,8.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a beer that opens up to new levels of flavour and smells when it warms up. The nose is spices and herbs with that sharp citrus note found in many farmhouse ales in the background.

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Served up a slightly cloudy light amber with a delicate fluffy white head. The smell is sweet and citrusy. It also has that nice "saison" smell to it that reminds me of summers living on a farm. There are also some complex herbal aromas, pepper and a clean malt character. The taste is more complex than your run of the mill farmhouse ale. Very herbal with plenty of peppery notes that are sharp and assertive. This beer has a firm bitterness, and a lot going on in the flavor department. The malt sweetness is there, but it is hard to pick up on the malt character with all the spices and whatnot. A tasty beer, but perhaps they were a bit heavy handed. The body is on the lighter side of medium with just the right level of carbonation and a nice dry refreshing finish. Very drinkable and a good beer, just not quite as good as I was hoping for.","zoso1967","Jun 14, 2010"
3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The drinkability is pretty good. Very tasty. The spices really cling to the palate. The taste lingered in my mouth for quite some time. Overall I have to say I was impressed.

The nose is decent, but fairly straightforward, as the sage and rosemary are pretty much all that come through. The taste is a bit more complex (thankfully), as the other spices begin to come through and there's some traditional clove/pepper notes that I'd expect in a saison. There's a little bit more bitterness than I usually encounter in a saison, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The body is nice and dry, and the aforementioned bitterness is crisp. There's a nice, high level of carbonation. The beer is very drinkable, as the spice presence stops just short of being overbearing.

Aroma has a bright herbal garden nose, the rosemary additiones stand out but I don't think I could pick out the others individually very pleasant. There's also a pleasant lemon/lime tone to the nos. Flavor is harsh with herbal spices, the underlyng saison is hard to determine because the untraditional brewing additions create a blanket of bitterness I'm guessing the thyme did this. It overpowers chicken when fresh and overused. Mouthfeel is medium bodied not boozey just a cast of bittering herbs sticks to the palate like Tom's organic toothpaste.

Head retention is pretty good, and there's also a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is herbs, citrus (grapefruit, lemon peel), and peppery spice. The herbal flavors in this brew overpower the citrusy and grassy hops flavors, but that's not a bad thing in this case. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think it's a good overall brew, the mix of herbs used in it work great.

Sage and rosemary are easier to pick out but it's all a pleasant muddle of savory herbs. The herbs make the malt aroma seem fresh and delicious. The flavor didn't work as well for me. It seemed oddly bland for a saison, much less a saison full of herbs. Medium sweet. Not much in the flavor really sets this beer out as a saison, and it doesn't compare favorably to the heavy hitters from Belgium. Mouthfeel is relatively light.

The flavor starts off with a large amount of geranium notes with grapefruit acidity and mild farmhouse funk and thyme, light sage. Sharp herbal bitterness in the middle and end, dry finish with mild farmhouse. Not sure if the herbs are bringing the bitterness up here or what, but it is a bit astringent on the finish, overly dry and really reduces the refreshment/drinkability factor.
