This "black Saison/Farmhouse" ale I feel is best enjoyed in the cooler months of Fall and Winter.  If you are looking for a different take on the style it is worth a try.  I for one prefer  a more traditional Saison/Farmhouse ale","bushbeer75","Mar 01, 2015"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: I can only assume that (almost) three years in the bottle has softened this beer quite a bit. I remember it having more of a peppery note, and a bit more edge. It's components stood out more. It's quite rounded at this point, and I'm not sure that that really works. I would imagine that early last year was probably its "sweet spot", so if you've got any in the cellar now would be a good time to start finishing them off.","NeroFiddled","Feb 23, 2015"
4.15,11,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Cool beer.  2013 vintage.  Pours like a stout, thick and black, with little head and virtually no lacing.  A little deceiving as it drinks very carbonated.  Pepper, leather, and yeast on the nose, but the taste is floral and bright like the saisons with the pepper present.  There's a lot interesting about this beer, from the powerful label to the juxtaposed color and flavor.  I'll drink it again for sure.  Goose Island continues to impress me.","Foxybrau","Feb 21, 2015"

4,7,,,,,,"Over 2 years old, the bottle that is being sampled for this review. Sampled using a Sam Adams special beer glass. Pours with big head that goes down quickly and becomes thin, Nose is not significant. Has brown ale overtones. Balance leans more to  the acidic side than sweet. More of an Italian style dark than a Belgian. Definitely malty, Does have a few raisin, molasses flavors. A bit peppery. Does not have much length to it. This would probably have been better after one year of aging. It has the thin qualities of a two year old Belgian. That is why I give it a higher rating than it deserves, due to the age of the bottle sampled. OK with cheeses and spicy foods.","Charliethebrit","Oct 08, 2014"

The liquid is a deep brown with yellowish rims, lots of particulate floating inside, still you can see the fat bubbles with ease. The nose is sweet, highlighting cola, cocoa, malted milk balls, vanilla and green apple to peach and cherry fruit scents, perhaps bready but not very yeasty and no citrus nor herbal/earthy notes. Full-bodied and lays thickly on the tongue, the carbonation adds initial prickle and then little much thereafter. Equally sweet here with chocolate, caramel, cola flavors, kind of like drinking an alcoholic Dr. Pepper. The fruit here more cherry to red berry in nature. Maybe, just maybe a little minerally earthiness at the end where it is also on the dry side. This beer provides pleasure, it simply leaves you a bit confused as to what its goal is.","farrago","Oct 05, 2014"

Taste reminds me of a Belgian style stout..definitely notice the 2 years of agey sweetness here. Mouthfeel is foamy and definitely sense the heat of alcohol here, although this is just stated as 6% abv on bottle. Overall, as a person who is not the biggest fan of Belgian style, highly drinkable.

Goose Island's Pepe Nero makes for a tasty spring or summertime treat, offering up an interesting marriage between dark, toasted malt notes and more traditional Belgian ale tropes. A bit more peppercorn would bump this up into world-class territory. A great beer that I would consider purchasing again, but I think I still prefer Sofie's lighter flavour (and lower price).","thehyperduck","Apr 09, 2014"

The nose is very nice, and exactly what I'd expect given the yeast and malt profile, but it seems that the peppercorns have taken over whatever may have made this more appealing. To me, this faults the most with the overly tannic, astringent, thin body of the beer - it makes it difficult to drink and I had to pair this with fatty food to cut it down a bit. By the end, however, I had to pass it on to someone else to finish for me. Here's hoping I get more out of any future GI experiments I get to try.","magictacosinus","Nov 25, 2013"

Smell is creamy with light doughy malt and a darker roasty underbelly. Taste is interestingly basic and easily enjoyable. Malty with some brisk piney hop and soft Belgian saison characteristics. A nice blend and probably a good choice even if you don't really feel like the style. A little roasted malt with some typical Belgian flavors. Mouthfeel is velvety, creamy, and perfectly carbonated with super fine little bubbles. Pretty good beer. Nicely balanced dark Belgian saison.","tastybeer","Oct 31, 2013"

Beer is smooth, easy to drink, and tasty, but I think I just am being picky about style points rather than don't think this is a great beer. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the sweet and somewhat roasted malts along with some spice and touches of yeast and tropical fruit but it just didn't come together as a whole for me.","clayrock81","Jun 30, 2013"

4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/20/2011. Pours hazy and cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2-3 finger foamy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, apple, clove, pepper, molasses, dark candi sugar, toast, light roast, light smoke, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with big malt presence; and good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, apple, pepper, clove, toast, molasses, roasted malt, dark candi sugar, light smoke, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, pepper, clove, molasses, toast, roasted malt, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with a great dark malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent black saison style. All around nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy ester notes with dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 22, 2013"

It's easy drinking, perhaps a touch too strong to be a true session beer. This would make for a great ballpark brew. One surprise for me, however, was that while I normally like most beers to be on the cooler side, particularly the lighter styles, Pepe Nero continued to improve as it approached room temperature, releasing its full flavor profile and becoming significantly more complex.","Ammertime","Mar 03, 2013"

The aroma is cola, chocolate, roasted malt, pepper and bananas. There’s very little saison yeastiness. It’s a nice beer but not particularly compelling. It smells a bit like a bland saison mixed with a stout. The taste is relatively sweet. There’s more pepper and cocoa. The cola flavor creeps up a bit much in the finish.

The flavor is not too far off a traditional saison until the finish where there is a slight roasted quality and savory finish that emphasizes some rich caramel notes that go unnoticed at first. The aftertaste is out of this world. Just a pleasant complex finish which coats the tongue. Mouthfeel is great - nicely carbonated to a point where the flavors are delivered on point. Also, just a tiny hit of spiciness from the rye (or peppercorns?) - for me, almost comes across more in the mouthfeel than the flavor. This is a pretty good saison - not too much to write home about. Not really outside of the box enough from a typical saison, which the brewery releases would have you expecting something far more interesting.

An interesting dark brown to black color, and the first time I have seen a black saison since trying De Viento at Jolly Pumpkin. This one goes in a different direction, though. Aroma has funky yeast and roasted grains, with some definite black pepper influence. A light taste here, very refreshing with some slight roast, and with slight pepper and strong carbonation. It is pretty unique, but no flavor stands out entirely. Goes down easy, and is almost refreshing. I would like to try this again.","BMMillsy","Sep 24, 2012"

It's pretty full bodied. It turns dry very quickly and vanishes upon the swallow, leaving the teeth a little chalky. Nice, dark, resiny tones mingle, staying fruity but never veering into sweetness. There's a touch of phenol after the swallow. A tangy aftertaste follows. This is just a very tasty ale!

3.81,1.9,4,3,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours like mahogany, just as their website claims, with a big beautiful sandy white cream head that leaves sticky tendrils of foam along the sides. It sits in the glass like a black French roast coffee and is very appealing. Carbonation seems to be constant and a little fierce along the edges of the glass, but the head retention is beautiful. The beer smells like a saison, sweet and biscuity with a nice yeast sweet sour funk that hints at citrus and pear. As the beer settles in the glass it ekes out touches of toffee and roasted malts, but nothing too pungent or noticeable. The beer tastes odd for sure, quite tart with the citrus saison kick. The Roasted malts and toffee dance at the back of the flavor and linger on the sides of the tongue as beautifully candied drizzling. The aftertaste is also strong with a roasty nutty coffee like fizz from the malts which is lovely but bizarre. The funk suggests some slight dark fruits but mostly a sweet bready sour citrus. The taste is really quite bizarre and I am having a hard time pinpointing it exactly. Mouthfeel is very smooth and slightly chewy on the tongue. Carbonation is light and velvety, and the beer leaves the mouth with a perfect amount of saliva and dryness. This beer seems to be a perfect fit for the cold winter months in front of a fire, and is really a bizarre take on the saison. I am very intrigued, though I can’t say whether I actually liked it or not. This beer is definitely worth a try, but I don’t know if it’s worth coming back too.","Maxwell","Sep 01, 2012"

More than three fingers of light tan foam rush up to fill the glass, coming right up to the lip before slowly edging back down. Lacing is left in a pretty solid ring at the top of the glass, but is fairly spotty below that. The nose features the rustic spiciness of rye moreso than the more intense heat of the advertised peppercorns. The peppercorns are still pretty subdued as far as flavor goes, again upstaged by the more earthy rye. There's also a big dry, roasted chocolate presence, that at best was minimal in the nose. It's just a bit too roasty for my taste. The body ends up coming across as a bit chewy or the style, between the chocolaty flavors and the heaviness contributed by the rye. Carbonation is just OK, showing a little bit of energy. There's a lot to juggle in trying to pull off a black peppercorn rye saison, and Goose Island just doesn't quite pull it off with Pepe Nero.","axeman9182","Jul 02, 2012"

This looks nothing like any saison I've seen before. The aroma is more typical of the style, however--fresh and invigorating, with coriander, citrus, pepper, and some crisp hop notes. The first thing that strikes me with regards to flavor is how supremely well balanced this beer is. As you first imbibe, individual elements are difficult discern, but you can tell they're quality. Smooth roasted malt and a mild, grassy bitterness ride a wave of prickly carbonation. Pepper is discernbile as well once the first wave has subsided, which should come as no surprise considering it's the only ingredient Goose Island took the time to mention on the label. I think I'm also catching some apple peel in there somewhere as well. The kicker for me, though, is the hint of smoky, bitter chocolate that creeps in on the back end--now that's a sophisticated finish. This looks nothing like your typical saison, and the aroma does not match the appearance at all, but none of that matters when it comes to sheer enjoyment. There's something here for everyone, from chocolate malt to zesty spice, all expertly balanced. This is one of my favorites among a stellar line-up from the adept team at Goose Island.","MaximalC","Jun 06, 2012"

Looks like a Baltic porter or perhaps a quad without carbonation as the skim is minimal with a dark tan hue. No stick on the glass. Smell is pretty pleasant with some dark Saison qualities, dark wheat with some live Belgian yeast giving bread. Some clove while the peppercorns come with warming. This saison is something different, it has a wheat quality while displaying some dubbel characteristics. Some cherry with wheat, going into a light bready yeast taste mixing in with a faint malting. Nuts in the background with light peppercorn flavor. Different for the style and very tasty stuff. Feel is less than medium with low carb so not much bite on the mouth. Goes down smooth and easy as pie. I thinks this would pair well with some cured meats and light cheese.

There were a few points where I felt this brew got a little "busy" and started to take away from the enjoyment. There's a lot of flavor here and it's hard to get you tongue into every nook and cranny.

4.42,18.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Its a very complex flavor - light and billowy on the tongue, it has an aerated feel while bringing to the front plum, pepper, chocolate malt in the middle, and a finish of cloves and white peppercorn. Delicious. Maybe it's running home in the rain, coming in soaked, and grabbing this out of the cellar, but it's really hitting the spot and I can see enjoying it regularly.","fvernon","Jan 28, 2012"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good and unique Saison, I knew as soon as I poured this into the glass that this wasn't your average Saison, the dark color threw me off at first but as soon as I smelled it I knew it was still a Saison. This beer has pretty good drinkability, I could drink a couple of these and if I had another one I would drink it, it also went very nice with the flank steak I had for dinner, one of the best dinner beer pairings I have had so far. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I especially liked the added complexity that the roasted malts imparted, that made for a Saison that was unlike any I have had before. There wasn't anything that I didn't like about this beer, I am usually not a fan of the barnyard funk. but with this beer I wouldn't have mind a little more which is very unusual for me and I think that given a couple more years in the cellar that the funk would be a little more prominent so I would like to try one with a couple more years on it. I would buy this beer again when looking to switch things up a little, it is a little pricey, but I think that this beer is worth the price. I recommend giving this beer a try, the roasted malts make this beer quite different from your average Saison. I am glad I took a chance on this brew and I am pretty surprised and impressed with how well this beer turned out, who would have thought that roasted malts would work well in a Saison, but they do, maybe more brewers will experiment with dark Saison's. I am starting to think I should give this brewery more credit, they can make some solid Belgian inspired beers and I liked the added creativity in this beer. One of the better Saison's I have had, Golden Cap is still my favorite traditional one, but when it comes to nontraditional Saison's this beer takes the cake, good work guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 28, 2012"

3.75,0.3,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"alright 12oz bottle poured into a tulip gives a big rocky off-white head that just sits on top of a deep coke brown color, showing moderate retention. the nose is very sweet with raisins, light caramel, yeast, figs and a coca-cola like scent. don't get a lot of peppercorn in the nose but its there and a good swirl helps. the taste is of yeast, clove, toasted malt, a touch of bitter hops and spiciness from the pepper is present in the finish with a touch of charred flavor. the mouth feel is just under medium with a very fizzy carbonation and is easy to drink. overall im glad i was able to try this but i enjoy more of a crisp farmhouse brew with some bitterness that is much less sweet and finishes much more dry and refreshing, this is really not a saison and i don't just say that because of the color. the balance between fruits, spice and bitterness is just not right. although this isn't the best of style it could still be enjoyed on a hot day while not confining to the typical brews. just not my favorite. thanks for the opportunity D!","JayAre46","Jan 23, 2012"

The nose is yeast, malt, peppercorn, and wheat. A little on the light side, but still very pleasant. The taste is a little surprising- it changes by the millisecond. Same profile as the nose, but it goes from sharp bite, to malt creaminess, barnyard funk, and almost a hefeweizen type finish. Overall, a good beer that has a few flaws keeping it from greatness.

There's nothing to say that you can't use darker malts in beers that are traditionally pale. It modifies the flavour - sometimes for better sometimes for worse, and this case I think it works. It just makes it a bit more challenging to review because there are no benchmarks to grade it against - it's mostly down personal preference with something as uncommon as this.","omnigrits","Aug 15, 2011"

4.08,9.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Initially it seems over-carbonated. The flavors seem in between a dunkelweizen (light malt flavors, lots of wheat) and a porter (very roasty and toasty). There's also some funk in there, which the carbonation actually helps to even out. The's a hop bitterness in the aftertaste, but there aren't a lot of IBUs here. There is an interesting dryness through the middle of the mouth, too. I might have said a Belgian-American porter. Maybe that's why it's disappointed so many as a saison?

In the middle I get a bit of the lifting sensation from the carbonation, but not as much as I have experienced with other saisons.

The aroma is mostly Belgian yeast with banana and clove, but also has some black pepper, bunt rye toast, and a dash of funky citrus. The flavor has a lot less potency than the aroma, but did pick up sweet malt, roastiness, pepper, and Belgian candi. Sweetness becomes toasty bitterness, with a touch of soap on the finish.

In addition to black pepper I'm picking up some chilies that give the beer some heat in the finish. It's also slightly earthy and funky but not as much as the aroma suggests. A good balance of roasted malt, dark fruit and spice. Hints of roasted chocolate, toast, grape, fig, raisin and plum. Slightly sweet and vinous but the dark malt notes and spicy peppers even things out. It could be to heavy on the spice for some but I enjoyed it.","corby112","Beers"

The taste is outstanding! It has such a complex array of flavors. It has a really nice roasted/chocolate malt character that does mute some of the traditional Saison character, but it also seems to enhance the experience. It still packs in a serious amount of esters as well as a bone dry finish. The black-ness really adds a layer of depth that contributes to a more well rounded malt character. The mouthfeel is fine.

First sip yields to a burst of sweet, fruit flavored bubble gum and then quickly turns over to a dry finish with a good amount of pepper. The start and finish of each sip are very contrasting. The sweetness of the malt carries over towards the back end of the beer and covers up part of the pepper flavor, which seems to work to this beer's advantage. The pepper adds a nice dynamic, perhaps even better if this were a paler beer (it still, however, works nicely in the nose).","100floods","May 01, 2011"

As given to me the head was about 1.5 fingers worth of sandy brown foam. In both smell and taste I found this beer to be light on the spice I was expecting. Really the spice taste was more in keeping with what I get in some rye based beers than in the peppercorn kick I thought I'd have. I picked up on some light hay/grassy notes with small notes of citrus, maybe some orange zest and slight lemon touches as well. I was struck by how "dry" this beer was. Nothing sticks in terms of the mouthfeel, and it almost reminded me of a dry champagne for that category. Overall this beer was very different than anything else I've had in the saison style, but it just wasn't what I would want on a regular basis.

It pours a smoky-garnet-tinted black-brown topped by a finger of sandy off-white foam. The nose comprises dark wheat, mild Belgian yeast funk, rye bread, light figs, and a hint of clove. The taste explodes the clove, adds some black pepper, lightly chars the wheat and toasts the rye, and morphs the yeastiness into a light green apple-ish flavor. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty damn dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice brew, but the dark spices are overdone and seem to o'erwhelm and lethally strangle the other flavors.

The dark, malty flavors aren't at odds with the Saison flavors, but I don't think that they add a great deal or advance the style in any degree. It's a bit like a Black IPA in that respect.

Mildly grassy and hay-like with a moderate acidity that's grainy in nature, this is a pretty dry beer. The acidity is enhanced by the high carbonation, making this really crisp (like a good saison should be). A prominent roasted malt character is present, not really what I was expecting, but given that the yeast isn't particularly expressive here, it adds a big and interesting character to the beer. Medium-light in body with high carbonation, this is not really to style, but is still an enjoyable beer.

It pours a deep, dark amber (almost black), with a nice, thick head and lacing on the glass. Hmm. A provocative aroma! I get a little heat, no doubt the peppercorns, rather than the alcohol (it's a relatively tame 6%). The taste? Wow. This is different. I get a strong malt sense in there, but it's quickly tamed down by the spice. It all finishes well with a peppery roastiness on the palate. It's all balanced and well-tasty.

I appreciate that the beer remains dry despite the addition of malts not usually found in the Saison style. Unfortunately, this expirement does not make for a shining example of drinkability in the style. It lacks depth, favoring an aggressive clove & peppercorn flavor profile, and the cooked spinach-like finish becomes tiresome in a hurry. Still, it's a fun beer and worthy of a purchase if you haven't tried it before.

Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and silky and has good carbonation. A little too much carbonation for me, but that's not a big deal. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and enjoyable.

This beer pours a silky dark, dark brown that is on the verge of black with a light half finger dark khaki head that laces the glass. It resembles a stout. The smell is very funky and earthy. It kind of smells like wet dirt after a rain, but in a good way. The aromas are a little subdued. The flavor is interesting. Comparing this to a usual saison probably isn't fair. It has a lot of funk, a good amount of yeast, but then it finishes with this slightly bitter flavor, kind of like plastic. I don't know if it's the peppercorns or what. The mouthfeel is probably the strongest part of this very fresh saison. It drinks and looks like a stout. It's crisp when it hits your palate then mellows to go down very smoothly. I'm a little disappointed yet I didn't know what to expect from my first black saison. The flavor is just very different. I'll age another bottle to see if it ages as gracefully as Goose Island's other bombers.","aasher","0"

Mild fruitiness to the middle of the drink. Also picking up some roasted malt and coffee notes. Really carries the drinkability of a regular saison.

I'd have a sofie over pepe nero any day of the week in the summer (or any time really since that's one of my favorite beers period), but this one could be a great fall beer if you are into matching beers with seasons. Today seems a bit warm for such a dark saison...I think I'll stay inside with the AC instead of bringing this one on the deck in this 95+ degree weather. I don't think I'll have much trouble polishing off this 1/2 growler. I'd have it again for sure. Great gateway saison beer for fans of darker beers.","cosmicevan","0"
4.25,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a dark black with very little head. Smells sweet with hints of fig. Taste is sweet like molasses with a hint of pepper and tobacco. Mouthfeel is thin but I like it. It's also quite sweet. Drinkability is good bit the unusual flavors detract. Overall a very good brew as it's quite different from the norm.","tegelaar","May 19, 2010"
4.2,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear amber with a decent eggshell colored head that falls to nothing after not too long. Nose is a tight pine tone. Flavor is...a bit unusual for the style, I think. A bit earthy and rough on the aftertaste and slightly stringent. And there is a bit of an unpleasant alcohol burn on the end too that stays in my mouth as an aftertaste. Seems a bit wrinkled and needs a run through with an iron to straighten things out a bit. Which I guess sums things up for this beer in general really. Not entirely a miss, but could've and should've been a whole lot more.","RblWthACoz","May 11, 2010"

3.04,-18.7,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Tasted on draft at Bad Apple. Pours almost black with a tint of amber. The head is thin but long lasting and off-white. Nose of rock candy, yeast, some breadiness, and both light coffee and coconut. Flavor is very light considering the color with citrus, candy, black pepper, yeast and bread. The dark malt comes through on the back with coffee and chocolate. Carbonation and body are both fairly light with a long, dark finish. Overall, this beer is good but not great.","wedgie9","May 09, 2010"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark semi-translucent brown with some sandy head. Leaves little lacing. Smell is a bit of funk, some fruitiness, and a bit of peppercorn. Tastes pretty good, a some more of the fruity saison flavors, but with some chocolate and peppercorn mixed in. Very interesting. Light body, not a ton of carbonation, very smooth. Very good drinkability, I really enjoyed this while I was waiting for the Cubbies to start.","LordAdmNelson","Apr 29, 2010"

3.8,1.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"M/D - Mouthfeel is a bit weak, slightly watery. Reasonably drinkable, the complexity is something that needs to be focused on to appreciate.","mwa423","Apr 11, 2010"
3.92,4.8,5,3,4,4,4.5,"d. goes down easy. just like GI's other offerings it goes down easy with loads of flavor. a dangerous combination typically, however it's $4 beer night and I think I'll have a few more.","onefiveseven","Apr 10, 2010"

3.12,-16.6,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"I dont know if I had a bad glass due to the fact that it was a new keg or a keg that was tapped wrong or mishandled or if that is the nature of the beer. Based on previous reviews I think I might need to revisit this beer.","MbpBugeye","Apr 03, 2010"
4.32,15.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall a nice beer, not something worth trading an arm and a leg for, but fans of unique American takes on Belgian farmhouse beers would love this. I dig some other GI beers more, like Sophie, but this was worth a shot!","jampics2","Mar 30, 2010"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pretty good, albeit different and interesting brew from Goose Island...was surprised at how dark it poured for a "saison" and thought the roasted malt was definitely different and unique...","hawks10","Beers"
4.48,19.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: I was very surprised to not find this listed on BA but re-checking with Ray's Place in Kent and then the Goose Island Web site I was assured that the name of the beer is correct. No word on the ABV, unfortunately.","adamette","0"
