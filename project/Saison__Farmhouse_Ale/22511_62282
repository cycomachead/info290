Super beer! I hope this is the first of many opportunities.","humuloner22","Mar 11, 2015"

4.45,2.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The smell and the taste definitely have a lemon zest quality.  There is a good amount of sourness which I'm guessing became more pronounced with age.  The sourness is well balanced by a slight sweetness from the malt.  It's a very well crafted beer that I would trade for again if the opportunity arises.","ELS","Mar 05, 2015"

Nose of barnyard from the yeasts with a hint of sourness. Taste is a refreshing saison with the late sourness but not over powering. Lemon sorbet - I'm thinking of the Lemon Ice on a hot day at the old Yankee stadium (go Blue Jays!), granny smith apple. Great acidity - eating eat with Sushi and would recommend this combo to foodys. Wish I had some oysters too. Overall enjoyed on it's own and with food. Thankfully I have another bottle which I will save for a warm summer's night.","KATCanada","Jan 03, 2015"

The saison style is a broad-ranging one, so it's hard to compare takes on the style that can be quite different from one another. That said, I can attest that this particular beer more than lives up to the massive reputation that precedes Hill Farmstead. It's the quintessential tart farmhouse ale in my mind.","LambicPentameter","Dec 31, 2014"

A lovely saison and I will look forward to seeing how this ages. Balance is pretty terrific, but you do have to crave the acidic tartness.","mick303","Dec 29, 2014"

My favorite saisons have that tart aspect yet keep a great complexity with grain and funk, and this beer has all of those qualities.","boilermakerbrew","Nov 14, 2014"

Pours a translucent straw-gold with a fizzy, 2.5 inch bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a soapy slick. A thick band of lacing encircles half the bowl of the glass and lingers between quaffs. Nose is slightly grassy and suggests green apple, a slight lemony quality and a suggestion of spice. Taste is biscuity and lemony and the green apple quality is present, but less so than in the nose; something of a Berliner-Weisse character in the flavor profile in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light in body with a bright carbonation that tickles the tongue and a slight astringency that stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a decent farmhouse but a bit too clean for my general sensibilities. Well worth a try if the opportunity presents.","Jwale73","Jul 01, 2014"

Essentially, appearance is similar- hazy straw yellow body with a nice two finger white head that lingers for a long while, leaving streaks of lacing. Smell is tart green apple skin, bready pale malt, peppery yeast spices, and quite a bit more funk than the last couple batches have had. Flavour is pretty similar, there is also a nice vinous quality to it that complements the tartness of the apple skins, which is actually tarter than previous batches, which I'm enjoying very much. Mouthfeel is medium in body, creamy and smooth. Very easy to drink. This is definitely the best batch of Arthur, versus fall 2013 (don't recall the month of bottling) and 2/2014. In particular, the 2/2014 bottling needed a good bit of time to reach the levels that 5/2014 is drinking at right now.","Stevedore","Jun 25, 2014"

It's a good saison, not perfect (I prefer more of the traditional belgian flavors like bubblegum, clove and banana in my saisons) but it's pretty damn good. That being said, I don't think that I would be paying $30 a bottle that it cost out in cali again. I'll wait until I make it to the brewery this summer.","BeerEngineer","May 06, 2014"

Poured a hazy pale yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, earth, fruit hop, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, spice, earth, and fruity spice. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. There was quite a bit of fruitiness going on in this one that definitely balanced quite well with the Saison aspect going on in it. The spicy and earthiness from the style definitely shined through and was quite well incorporated with the rest of the brew and managed to compliment the other aspects well. I just wish there would have been a little more complexity going on to take it to a new level. Glad I got the chance to try this one, but not the best Saison I have ever had to this day.","thagr81us","Mar 08, 2013"

It holds my interest in the same way a good sour does (RR Temptation), but is so refreshing and the ABV is so reasonable it could be an everyday drinker. That is if you live within driving distance of HF and have a bunch of $ to spend $10/750ml. It's worth it, IMO, but I do not drink it everyday.

The retention was impressive and it left consistent bands of lacing. The aroma was of melon, apricot, grassy hops, pepper, hints of citrus and some musty ‘horseblanket’. The flavors were also complex and impressive. Though not as well defined as the aroma it did have all the aforementioned elements built around a core of pilsner malt and toasted malt. Clean and refreshing. The mouthfeel was creamy and delicate, the body medium and the carbonation perfect.

Aroma of rustic ester and floral malt is very nice and enticing. Taste is also a nice mix between some floral malt with good attenuation and limited sweetness with some rustic notes and a lightly spicy yeast strain. Body is full with excellent carbonation. Hops are present though not overly so and provide nice zesty flavour. Another great combination between some complex flavour while retaining some great complexity.","Phyl21ca","Dec 04, 2011"

4.15,-4.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The palate opens crisp with a firm hop bite, with earth, lemon, orange peel and a mild resin character. Bitterness is moderate, and allows the malt and yeast flavors to come through. Moderate grass and pilsner malt along with a grainy flavor, the malt character is mellow and refined. The yeast mostly adds flavors of clove and phenols, especially on the finish. Drying on the finish with a crisp, clean, hoppy bitterness and the aforementioned flavors, this tastes very good. I'm not picking up much of the fruit or honey character that I got on the nose, though. The mouthfeel is surprising. Both, the body (light) and carbonation (medium-high) are spot on, but there's a mild wateriness on the mid-palate that's a little disappointing. Apart from that, this is an excellent saison, one I'm glad to have gotten the chance to enjoy.","DefenCorps","Oct 30, 2011"

3.98,-8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Arthur came out looking like a saison, golden straw colored in appearance with a bright white head up above leaving nice patterns. Smell is a semi-big Belgian yeast profile with earthy grass ridden hops. Some citrus and spice. They work together well, nothing too overpowering the other. My first Saison from the farm is a good one. Arthur starts with the earth, the grass, the yeast (bread), semi tropical fruits very muted but noted with pear slices. It's a simple saison with a american twist that's not to outragous or out there. Good for a whirl. Feel is kinda lower than medium, with a small carb bite as well, a yeasty aftertaste with some bitter hops at the end. I could probably drink more of this stuff. Another good one from the boys at the farm.","BARFLYB","Jan 06, 2011"
3.77,-13.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Chewy medium body with a lot of bready yeast which contributes to the moutfeel. There is also a lot of zesty peppery spice up front with more coriander and lemon zest. Hints of sweet citrus and crisp light fuir, especially orange peel, apple and pear. Not a bery high ABV but the alcohol presence is still felt.
