The sour notes are much more present in the smell than taste. Light spice notes dance around the light and crisp wheat flavor, but never get too out of hand. Mouthfeel is nice and even, nothing out of place in the beer. Is this a balanced beer ? Absolutely, is it my favorite one I've ever had from Jolly Pumpkin ? Not by a long shot, but its damn good.

Pours lightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger foamy and rocky light khaki head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of sour cherry, green apple, pear, grape, clove, hay, pepper, oak, toast, cocoa, light roast, leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast, barrel, and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lightly tart cherry, green apple, pear, grape, toast, cocoa, light roast, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, light leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. A touch of earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, toast, cocoa, light roast, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, light leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and oak flavors with a nice balance of dark/roasted malts; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dark saison style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 16, 2013"

For the flavor, I found it to be pleasantly sour and tart, like apple cider vinegar, and with plenty of that farmhouse funky yeast taste. It was very fizzy, light-bodied, and crisp, almost enough to make me pucker in the end. The only slight criticism I had was that I noticed a slight vegetal/herbal hint intermingled deep within the other flavors that I was not so sure about. I definitely want to have another though, and would highly recommend this to those that like sours.","Neorebel","Nov 28, 2012"

The taste is refreshingly tart, with a subdued sweetness and malt underbelly. Wine-line in the finish, which is crisp and a bit effervescent...drier than expected, given the foretaste. Not bad at all.","Suds","Apr 21, 2012"

Not that it is bad, it is very interesting with lots of flavor in a sharp profile. But it is a bit too much to enjoy drinking by itself. If you have a bottle of this that is this old then try it with some dinner. By itself the carbonation & dryness take even the low abv right to your head. (plus the intense tart/sour flavor).

However, as I am realizing with many JP beers, it tastes very much like all of the other beers they make that are barrel-aged, they just have a weird funk, with just a tinge of tartness. Bam Noire though was not good. I suspect the base beer before barrel treatment was probably very phenolic and plastic tasting from fermentation that ran too hot, because the finished beer is just not good. I can taste the fermentation flaws and combined with the barrel, it tastes like old water passed through a sun soaked plastic hose that is run through an old leather glove. I spent a fair bit of money on this beer and most people that drank it agreed that it was not good. One of the few occasions that I have drain poured a beer.","Soonami","Feb 23, 2011"

An apple seed bitterness settles onto the roof of the mouth with this beer. A very long finish. Medium carbonation with a light astringent mouthfeel. I don't know what to say about it overall. It is a very different beer from the usual lager, pales, IPAs, stouts, porters, and browns I am used to. I will give the brew the benefit of the doubt because I like the brewery.

A slight woodiness and touch of spice also manage to make it through the funky tartness as it warms, but this beer seems to be a bit one dimensional. It is almost like a mild but with funky tartness.

A bit reserved, but definitely a really drinkable beer. MF is bright and bubbly with some decent carbonation. Dry finish, lasting aftertaste.

I enjoyed it, mainly for the straw-like, horse-blanket, mineral and tart contributions of the Brettanomyces, and the oak, but it never got off the ground. So, I'd say that it's better than the Bam E.S.B., but I'll take any other Jolly Pumpkin before this one. On a wider scale... it's OK. It's at least interesting.

You can't exactly smell the dark malts underneath, but you notice it when you taste. I fell in love with this beer from the first sip. You notice this brilliant caramel sweetness, almost backed with a bit of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and almost vanilla. And it finishes wonderfully tart. The perfect balance so that the tartness, sweetness, and dark malts never come unbalanced. You know what I think this tastes like? Tamarind. I think this will be one of my 'subjective' score beers, since I've never seen anything like it. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but never unpleasantly so. That's about all I can complain about.

A mild malt presence helps cut the tartness. Moderate body with soft carbonation, a tad dry. If tart is your thing that this is one you want to pick up.

Poured a deep opaque brown with a purple hue. Rocky one-inch off-white head dissipated gradually into a thin consistent skim of algae. Sheets of lacing with good retention present during the tasting. Scents were difficult to tease out, but first impression was sour and wine-like. Flavor was also subdued; more sour, but not overwhelmingly so, as well some oakiness (reminds me a little of a cabernet). Consistency fell somewhere between light- and medium bodied, but effervescence helped round out the mouthfeel nicely, and finish was fairly clean with just a touch of sourness lingering.

Just some slight cola and hints of earthy horse infused funk in the nose. I have a hard time getting a good take on these Jolly P beers. I dont drink em that often and when I do they always seem somehow hard to figure out. Have they gone south in the bottle or are they supposed to be slightly over carbonated, then somewhat thin taste wise and then wild and funky? Anyway, I'll go with the wild and funky thing here, as this one seems fresh and in good shape. Notes of more cola, wood, tang, slight barnyard funkyness, moderatly sour, with just light malts and minor to no hops. Interesting, lively and active brew, its alive and vibrant in the mouth. Give this one a try if you like some sourness and are able to find a bottle or two in you area.","Billolick","Feb 12, 2008"

This spice notes are nice and there is plenty of refreshing sourness, but the oak is rough around the edges (quite tannic and lacking any vanilla character) and there is not quite enough residual sweetness to balance everything out. In some ways this beer reminds me of Rodenbach, but it is not as subtle or complex; I would expect that with some additional aging it might compare more favorably.","nickfl","Feb 10, 2008"

Liked it at first...nooot diggin' the plastic so much. Flavor is deep and robust. A part of it almost seems like roasted game of some sort. The plastic tone kind of comes back, and I have to say it kills the experience a bit. There is just something lacking...something out of line.

The taste is likewise, thin, lightly sour, clean and light, and has some light malt as well. Mouthfeel is relatively thin. If it had a bit more oomph it would be a lot better.

The foam was really sticky with good head retention, and very slowly thinned to a thick ring and skim of fine bubbles. The aroma had the funkyness I associate with JP - a bit of barnyard and light vinegar, with an earthy and bready center. There was a very quick, sharp bitterness up front with mild sweetness at the rear and a bit of lingering, grassy bitterness and a hint of chocolate. There were also notes of leather, earthiness, acidic vinegar, and some fruitiness throughout. Medium/light bodied with generous carbonation, it stayed fairly crisp and was on the dry side. Definitely on the mouthwatering side. I enjoyed it and it was a tasty brew, but I think I liked the regular bam biere a little better.","DrJay","Jan 10, 2008"

The aroma is heavy on the wild yeasts and gives off a tons of earthy (and even some fecund marine) smells). Underneath the sweat and salt and rot is a light toasty malt backing with just a touch of spent coffee grounds. Wonderful aroma. On the palate, hop bitterness up front, with a tart backing that grows into the mid-palate. Toward the end a slightly sweet and smooth nutty malt character comes out. Very interesting tastes here. Overall, this is a really interesting beer. It's an odd category for a beer -- a dark farmhouse ale -- but the results are, at the same time, expected and unique. Very cool.","geexploitation","Dec 06, 2007"

It may sound gross, but I find this beer to be quite tasty. Very refreshing, a nice departure from most beer styles. I wouldn't hesitate to grab another. This beer would be easy to session, and I can see it pairing real nicely with smoked pork, smoked chicken, maybe a salad, some steak. Also a nice session beer.","becktone","Dec 05, 2007"

Some vinous, cherry notes through the middle and settles in the finish with a bit of musty, husky grains and bitter, dry cocoa powder. Descent mouthfeel thats well carbonated and not too watery for a 4.3. Not bad for a dark saison, Ive got mixed emotions on this one.

It has a sweet and sour smell with aromas that I am unable to pinpoint, it is just quite odd. The Jolly Pumpkin website says that the aromas is of "worn leather and cool autumn nights. Notes of sweet plum and toasted raisin, hints of coffee and cacao." I cannot pick up those aromas, but this is different than most other selections out there. The taste has that toasted raising coming out immediately with a few sour notes following. The toasted flavor lingers at the end. The mouthfeel is good, very smooth. I couldn't see having more than a couple of these in one sitting, I would consider this more of a slow drinker. Worth checking out, different but interesting.","wingman14","Oct 27, 2007"

Aroma has tart raisins with green apples flowing with tobacco leaf qualities galore as I dig deeper it's more of the same with some cider and mild vinegar tones. Flavor brings dry dark chocolate edges with soft fruity sweetness rounding out the dry tart edges, herbal qualities from the hopping flows freely and comes out very notably here. Body is medium with very nice spritzy fine carbonation that carries the body much lighter than it actually is, much like a farmhouse schwarzbier really flows well on the palate. Really leaves a dry palate with each sip, due to the tart sourness this beer contains each sip really leaves nothing in the finish besides a dry puckering effect. Drinkability overall is great and purchased a couple standard Bam's to compare this variation side by side, I love Jolly Pumpkin this dark version a farmhouse ale is no different quality and the little doggy is sporting bat wings I guess it's the right time of year for it.","WVbeergeek","Oct 24, 2007"

(A dim recall of 20 year-old Barbe Rac or 30 year-old village Barolo). A tall topping receeds in a pattern that looks like minature sandy white ski moguls. At approximately 60 degrees F the acids are sweet and dominant. Bitterness of the dusty, moist concrete variety is easy to recognize as well. Bright fresh red and green apple fruit, damson, sour cherry, mustard and over-spiced applesauce flavors. Potentially perfect in the right context.

Taste follows suit. Tart citrus and acidic sour cherries up front. Has a toasted/roasted edge, though, which makes for a weird/unique combination. Sour stays throughout, with subtle barnyard notes.
