Very faint touch of sweet with a doughy and yeasty thing there too. Nice Belgian style ale. Love to see American breweries producing Belgian ales on this level.","RblWthACoz","Mar 15, 2015"

I don't know how to describe this beer because its not really an IPA and its not really a Belgian hopped up ale either. Its very unique really. Totally enjoyable.","humuloner22","Jan 03, 2015"

4.19,0,4.25,4.5,4,4,4.25,"I was excited to stumble upon this recently while traveling through Maryland...  A standard pour yields a voluminous three plus fingers worth of light airy fluffy snow white head comprised of mostly huge chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  Once settled, there is a mostly full veil of lacing and moderate-to-thick collar...  The color is a slightly pale mix of light straw and muted amber...  A moderate bit of carbonation some of which clings to the glass and some of which rises briskly throughout...  Some lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head starts to settle...  The nose is big and assertive...  It's equal parts Belgian yeast blast and citrusy hop goodness...  It smells like you're standing right next to the brew kettle...  Vibrant lemon and orange zest...  Some nice light earthy character as well...  Grassy and Belgian yeast to start...  A bit of an earthy hop bite throughout...  Some light peppery notes on the finish...  On the fuller side of light bodied...  Very delicate...  Limited carbonation...  Airy, but not thin in any way...  Just a subtle touch of dryness...  Quite unique and enjoyable mouthfeel...  A very unique and highly enjoyable brew...  A tremendous introduction to Prairie Artisan Ales...  The Saison character wins out by a bit, but the American hop presence add layers of complexity and dimension that make this a must try for any self respecting beer geek...","philbe311","Jan 02, 2015"

There's a half inch of eggshell colored minuscule sized carbonation bubbles.  Aroma is comprised of sourdough bread,tropical hops and grassy saison yeast. I taste a blend of sourdough bread,tropical hops and earthy saison yeas.  The tropical hops really give it a unique twist.  APA meets saison.

4.27,1.9,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"500 ml bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both very good.  The brew smells like straw, grassy and citrusy hops, yeast, mango, citrus peel, and earthiness.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery spice, tropical fruit, grainy malt and a bit of peach noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and goes down pretty easy.  I think it's a good hoppy saison, another quality Prairie brew!  It's pricey at $10.99 a bottle, but it's a tasty brew!  Definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","Nov 08, 2014"

Aroma of big funky saison yeast, grassy hops, some pine, very sweet honey notes, and some other fruits in there.  Flavor follows with very sweet fruits from the hops, a bit of zesty citrus peel bite, grass, honey.  Mouthfeel is thicker than expected, but lightened up by the high carbonation.  Overall this was very nice, but not what I had expected going in.  Definitely a good beer, but easily one of my least favorite Prairie saisons out there.","BMMillsy","Oct 12, 2014"

It is a nice and dank saison, overdone with a thorough dry hopping.  This allows for the hops to become part of the equation, without overwhelming it.  Said hops are subtle but add a definite bitterness to the taste that continually enhances and deepens with warmth.  Every component here is really well defined.  The finish is crisp, clean, and intensely drying, and is probably the most enjoyable and memorable aspect of this beer.  They really hit that stylistic point right on the head.  There has been a big outflowing of these hop-driven saisons lately, and the cultural shift is nearly palpable.  This is no doubt a product of that revolution, and it is welcomed with open arms.  We can’t wait to see what else Prairie has in their arsenal.","TheBrewo","Sep 29, 2014"

Of course, I'm a sucker for the heavily hopped saisons, but they aren't all done well--it's just that this one is. It's the kind of marriage between the two core elements of American (hops) and Belgian (yeast) styles that provides incentive for brewers to keep pushing boundaries, because when they work, sometimes they really work.","LambicPentameter","Sep 23, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, Belgian yeast, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, Belgian yeast, and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel.

4.3,2.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Got in a trade with Cyde. 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 dating stamped on the cork. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, lemon zest, tangerine, mango, pear, apple, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, hay, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pineapple, peach, tangerine, lemon zest, mango, pear, apple, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, hay, grass, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, mango, tangerine, hay, floral, grass, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hop and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, lightly slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic dry hopped saison! All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast esters; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2013"

The hops are juicy and then their bitterness rushes the funky part of the grainy-nut flavor through my mouth with ample carbonation and a medium/slightly thick creamy and refreshing mouthfeel. I also get a subtle herbal flourish, and orange rind is in there too. The slightly antique flavor I took as peanut butter sits well in the aftertaste, somehow. The finish is dry but right. The foam from the head is intact halfway through the chalice into which I poured this, appearing like cream. Nice. I dont recall having a beer that kept such a thick-top form. Unique brew. Recommended by local retailers here in north Texas, however I passed on it until now. Curiosity paid-off big time. Oklahoma is on the craft map here in a big way with in my opinion.

I like it better than Greenflash’s iteration, but the same as Rayon Vert, Hop’s hoppiness is a bit sticky and American and in some un-articulable way it just don’t jibe up with the Belgian Blondey-ness of the beer’s opening half.

Belgian character is overwhelmed by hops. Pale malts. Flavor is also very hop-forwarded. Kind of sweet up front with a drying finish. Belgian yeast plays a bit more in the flavor.

Pours a nice orange-golden color with a creamy white head. Nice lacing with a prominent ring that lasts throughout the drink. The nose reminds me of PTE ... lots of hoppy pineapple, tangerine, and citrus aromas, with just a touch of saison/farmhouse yeast. Taste follows the nose...simply fantastic! Perfect body and mouthfeel for a saison. To me, this is what a saison would be if Russian River took their recipe for PTE and made a farmhouse version.

Solid stream of carbonation bubbling throughout, also. Aromas of wet greens initially, with some citrus hops highlights and coriander spicing. Flavors are extremely well balanced, with a forward flavor of wet, peppery hops balanced with citrus and berry sweetness. There is a bready and roasted backbone that also blends and supports the spice and funk. Slightly warming, and the smooth body makes this a severely easy drinker. Wow. Candy sweet and herbal aftertaste that balances perfectly, and is subtle enough to draw you further in. Smooth, clean finish, with a hint of citrus and spice left behind to linger. Great brew.","GarthDanielson","May 23, 2013"
4.47,6.7,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Hazy, bright orange appearance in the glass with a light white head. Many tiny bubbles bounce to the surface. The scent has a fair bit going on. The yeast is very faint as the hops take over with citrus and some grassy/pine. The taste is like tangerine juice. Loads of tangerine flavor with a bittering finish. The finish is a clean bitterness though that plays well and balances. I'm a big fan of the effervescence in this beer. It makes the beer much brighter and even more enjoyable to drink. I have a hard time calling this a saison. It almost drinks like a beer-mosa. It was a pleasure and quite tasty.","PHBoiler","May 23, 2013"

Bright gold-orange, airy head of white foam that builds to several fingers and lays down some nice lace. Vibrant citrus, tropical, herbal, minty, powdery hoppiness is front and center. A rustic graininess keeps it somewhat in line with the farmhouse theme in the face of the barrage of big American hops. Other complementary flavors include black pepper, woodiness, and a grungy earthiness, but really it's all about the bright hoppiness. Dryness accentuates the hoppiness further. One of my favorites from PAA, this needs to be available in more formats.","bump8628","May 12, 2013"

4.48,6.9,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,"one of the best saisons, if not beers altogether, that ive had in some time. this pours a soft pale amber color, faintly red, with at least two inches of sturdy white head and some suspended yeast. its mysteriously pale, and is emitting scents of far out yeast, fresh and abundant citrus hops, and a medium pale malt body with the dryness of an irish red. the flavor is the best of both worlds as far as hops and wild yeast goes. its familiar like mikkellers farmhouse invasion, minus the brett, substitute spicy apply saison yeast that's got all the farm you can handle. the hops are plenty bitter, but also cleverly fruity, which makes for excellent balance. every sip is different, cascading a new part of my palate, challenging yet comforting me at the same time. the craftsmanship behind the bubbles here is so profound, I promise you the beer world will start to talking about prairie before long. before this weekend, I had never heard of them at all, and this week I was fortunate enough to get a bottle of the noir in my rare beer club, and its burning a hole through my fridge. im sure ill drink it tonight after work unless I can garner some self control. this is maybe the best saison ever made, and it takes a lot for me to say that. the way the aggressive hops and the funky yeast play off each other is pure bliss. do yourself a favor and get a few bottles of this. youll never look back.","StonedTrippin","Apr 28, 2013"

The flavors are bright and hoppy with excellent grassiness, lemon, grapefruit, and it finishes with a pineapple bomb of fruit character in the finish that dominates the after taste. I don't think I've ever seen that much pineapple in any saison. It is very unique and more importantly, incredibly good. You don't notice the 7% at all either, making this one dangerous and overly drinkable. This is my first Prairie experience and it blew me away. This is an incredibly flavorful and special saison.

Aroma is full of wonderful saison complexity. There's a big earthy note, really nice. The hops contribute grassy and floral flavors that blend into the beer without dominating it. A blend of fruity flavors also crop up - pears, grapes, apricots, plums, lemons, persimmons, pineapples. The taste isn't quite as strong as the Prairie Ale, which hit pretty much all the right saison notes for me. There's just a touch too much malt sweetness, but it's still quite good. Lots of spicy, grassy hop flavor comes across on the tongue. Also, more musty, barnyardy character than in the aroma. The malt just isn't quite as bright or crisp as I'd like, but it's still tasty. Just not quite up to the other flavors. Good grassy, herbal hop finish. Almost a bit minty. Good champagne-ish feel. Lots of fine bubbles. Full. I prefer Prairie Ale by just a bit, but this is another excellent beer from this young brewery. Very impressive work.","popery","Mar 06, 2013"
