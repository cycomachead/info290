They can call it sage but i get more clove.  Mouthful is refreshing with medium carbonation and slight dryness. Overall its a unique take on the saison.  To me it tastes like a saison and dream weaver mix.  The wheat beer is definitely present.  Gotta be in the mood for this one.","lushes22","Feb 24, 2015"

Enjoyable but I wouldn't say it shows the traditional delicacy of the style. Still a nice mix of citrusy, creamy malt and yeasty emerge over the course of this beer, and its a pleasing, if slightly rollicking, trip. Very solid.","mick303","Dec 22, 2014"

4.5,11.7,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Rolls out with a pillow head that I had to wait while it dissipated, good retention.  It had the expected saison smell, with a good bit of spice.  The flavor was very nice, the sweet, with maybe a little spiciness, very clean on the finish, outstanding.  After being disappointed with my first few tries with Stillwater this one was excellent and will have me giving them more of a chance.  Outstanding saison.","JamieDuncan","Dec 20, 2014"

The head was thin, and lacing light. When it comes to saisons, I am almost always at a loss in describing taste and aroma. In this case, the fragrance was that of herbs. I can say no more, except, perhaps, that the slightest perception of mint seemed to surface. The flavor, as well, was imprecisely and very pleasantly herbal, with a strength that was surprising. Is there some citrus? Is there a spicy piquancy? Perhaps. After a few draws from the glass, however, the need to analyze recedes. The beer tastes good--that's what matters--and, well...distinguished. Its presence on the palate is foamy and smooth. Its finish, both in taste and feel, is quite fresh.","Altrurian","May 23, 2014"

4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/5/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops, yeast ester, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, grass, herbal, floral, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy spice/bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, grass, herbal, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and spice flavors; with a great yeast/spice flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome spiced saison style. All around great complexity and balance of hops, yeast ester, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 27, 2014"

Mostly citrus - orange zest, tangerines, some grass, a bit of a funk. The taste is quite exceptional and not very subtle. Right away a sharp, lemony, intense tartness, sour citrus. Then it eases a bit on the citrus, and that's where some herbal flavors come in - sage, grass - as well as a much needed but not overbearing sweetness, . The aftertaste is almost pure tangerine oil and zest. Slightly viscous, subtle carbonation, very fine bubbles. Extremely refreshing on a hot day, or so I can imagine. Why am I drinking this in January in Alabama and not in August? Well, it was on the discount table at 2 bucks a bottle. Definitely one I'd search out for again.","kaufmaal","Jan 05, 2014"

Packaging, despite having perhaps quaint intentions, looks pretty spooky. I mean, you think cellar door, first thing I think is bodies, then bugs, then maybe an old dead cat. But no, this really is a good farmhouse ale, and the sage is a nice addition. It pours a pearlescent amber with short head, and you definitely get the sage in the nose pretty prominently, along with berry and spice. Flavor is tart, slightly sweet, a little sour, and sagey for sure. Body is medium, almost approaches thick with everything going on with the sage and...is this hopped? I don't know. Definitely some bitterness in the finish, though. Good, probably great, but I don't think I'd get it again, ONLY because of the price and the four pack format. Otherwise, it's awesome. Get it.

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and sage aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, yeast, and sage flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid sage presence that comes across slightly better in the aroma.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 03, 2013"

This definitely seems to borrow a few flavor profiles from a German Weiss. The banana leaf, cloves and accentuated wheat flavors are all blended into a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale recipe to create something slightly different. For that reason, I give it a higher rating because it's not just trying to follow a traditional recipe or do what everyone considers a "Farmhouse/ Saison." This stands out a bit more from the group, and for that I really like it.","Agent1","Sep 10, 2013"

3.81,-5.5,2.75,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a golden orange color, like a deep, dark piss. The beer forms a light head of pale white bubbles that quickly fizzle away to a thin, almost-non-existent scrim on the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is clean but murky, with just faint suggestions light and shapes coming through from the other side of the glass. Upon further examination, tiny specs can be seen floating in the beer, though none are of a considerable size. On the nose, the beer smells smoothly funky with saison yeast and a good touch of pepper that spices the nose. Pineapple and a touch of orange juice can also be sensed on the nose, along with a nice, light wheat flake scent that suggests the beer’s malt. The pineapple smell blends in and out of the funk smell, suggesting a presence of juicier hops and some nice, hay-like funk. On the tongue, the beer tastes fruity sweet and acidic with a light, tart pucker to the mouth and a very light touch of bitterness, which comes through more in the aftertaste. In flavor, the beer begins as light wheat malt, immediately exploding into huge pineapple bursts of flavor with herbal, funky side flavors and a light bitter grapefruit. The funk is deep enough that I think I detect some brett in the flavor, though I didn’t think this beer had any in it… The finish is dry, yet full of pineapple funk flavors and just a touch of wheat malt, which the aftertaste accentuates. In the mouth, the beer feels sharp in carbonation, coming in somewhere on the heavy side of medium, while the body sits on the tongue comfortably at a medium weight. The mouth is left dry except for acid cancelling saliva on the sides of the cheeks and a light stickiness on the tongue. Overall, this is a nice little saison with some rich complexity. It is delicate and very fruity with its funk, most likely due to the addition of white sage. It’s not my favorite American Farmhouse Ale though. It’s good and tasty and I would never turn it down, but it doesn’t seem like the type of beer I would drink more than one of at a sitting, as it sits in the stomach a little heavy. It’s rich and complex, but it doesn’t light up my palate like it has for others.","Maxwell","Aug 24, 2013"

The flavor and aroma of the beer are both so balanced and have so much going on, without being confounding in any way: the sage feels like such a perfect fit with the saison yeast, as do the Citra hops, but on different ends of the spectrum (sage complementing the spicy esters and the Citra complementing the fruity esters of the yeast, respectively). That’s my feeling, anyway. What’s also great about this is that it’s a top-notch saison that would be a great introduction the style for those unfamiliar. This beer is fantastic, I highly recommend it, and will absolutely be seeking it out in the future.","fmccormi","Nov 11, 2012"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spice, fruit, passion fruit, kiwi, and floral. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, spice, earth, alcohol, and passion fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really went into this one expecting to find a huge earth dominance going on, but was pleasantly surprised at how much the fruit aspect dominated this one while still having the earthiness present. All was well, but I just wish that the flavor was a little more balanced as the earthiness was the dominate factor in it. There was quite a bit of fruit but it kind of clashed with the earthiness and alcohol. Definitely a must try for any Saison fan out there without a doubt.","thagr81us","Aug 30, 2012"

The body is light and crisp, but it is also filling/fluffy from the yeast. Crispness is pleasurable, not a deterrant, as a great blend of citric/herbal hops, clove, spice, and I guess sage (can't really tell to be honest) blends with typical light saison fruits such as tropical (label says tangerine, more like pear, green apple) and there is some mild sweetness in the beer.

The sage comes through on the palate, sharp and distinct. Very effervescent. It’s piney, or perhaps more accurately, rosemary-y. Yes, rosemary, although I don’t think it’s brewed with it. I catch a little bit of chew on the finish with a residual aftertaste. (Not chew as in tobacco, chew as in chewy.) There’s some funk at the end as well.

4.12,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Cellar Door has carbonation and creaminess in spades. In fact, the flaw of its mouthfeel lies in having to much of these things. Swish the beer around in your mouth and it foams up, it thickens, into a slightly too-heafty beer, while the carbonation is slightly too overactive. The entire mouthfeel reminds me of Dr. Pepper in this way. Overall, this is a darn good Saison. It smells and tastes quite fresh and floral. Its brewed conventionally for the style, but manages to come across as quite traditional. This is one of the better American iterations of the Saison style.","Reaper16","Jul 20, 2011"
4.12,2.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a murky yellow. Not great, but fine for the style. Things take off from there. Spices abound--ginger in particular. Where did this come from? The label says it is brewed with sage. Perhaps it is the power of suggestion as more herbal notes flow...Rosemary, sage, coriander. There is a twang in the nose, like a sour, on-the-verge-of-spoiling flavor. I love it. It is not an acetic sour, but a sour-mash type aroma. Pale malts abound and the beer satisfies and still suggests more sips with each swallow. Hard to get enough. Aromatic herb garden aromas linger on the tongue. Definitely pick this one up if you see it.","dnrobert24","Jul 19, 2011"

Pours a semi-hazy honey-gold with a rocky, three inch bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a solid quarter inch cap embedded with tiny pinpricks. Some lacing, but no legs. Nose is herbal and grassy - sage presents up front followed by citrus and a trace of cut grass. All and all, fairly clean for a Farmhouse. Taste follows nose; however, citrus comes out initially, with the sage expressing itself more towards the finish. Something else is also happening towards the middle. I get a trace of sweetness (perhaps candi sugar?), in addition to the grassy quality. The mouthfeel on this somewhat kills it for me. Carbonation is extremely gassy. Body is light-medium and there's a definite prickliness that is partially attributable to the carbonation, as well as the citrus acidity. Finish is semi-dry. A quality and complex domestic Saison; however, the carbonation is way too assertive and really detracts from the taste. If the carbonation was more under control, I'd probably score this in the high B+ to low A- range.","Jwale73","May 12, 2011"

4.38,8.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a capped 750ml into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a super hazy almost white yellow with a big massive 4-inch cap that leaves heavy lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma has as nice herbal aroma up front. While I cant particularly taste sage, it reminds me of almost a basil/rosemary blend. A nice wheat tang follows with a earthy mustiness. At the very tail end of the aroma comes a nice floral pick me up. The flavor is much the same. The mustiness is a bit more prevalent then in the aroma. Nice herbal flavor but not overpower like it is in several beers. The sage is balanced with a nice floral hopping. A bit of wet grass and just a bit of aspirin. Really tasty. In my opinion, the mouthfeel of a saison is what makes or breaks the beer. You can have a saison that tastes great but finishes sweet and full and it just falls completely flat. This gets it right. It finishes nice and dry, leaving you tongue feeling like you just sucked on a piece of sandpaper. Overall, this is a fantastic saison. Glad to have another fantastic saison available in the state.","hwwty4","Apr 09, 2011"

The foam takes awhile to dissipate, and crackles down to leave a thin foam top on the beer. Awesome visual so far. Smell- lemon zest, cracked pepper, a tart fruit scent, with some really nice bready farmhouse flavors. Intense flavors. Taste- sweet bread, lemon, clove, pepper (faint), coriander.

Aroma is citrus (lemon peel, tropical fruit), and peppery and herbal spice, which I assume is partly from the white sage in this beer. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some lime and a bit of wheat. Overall taste is citrusy and herbal.

Some light herb flavors also come through on the dry finish. Mouthfeel is very foamy, to the point where I need to let the beer sit in my mouth for a while to lose some of the carbonation.

Mouthfeel is VERY Champagne-like. Crisp on my tongue and very dry. Drinkable as hell, as all Saisons should be. Looking forward to more Stillwater beers.","WestValleyIPA","Nov 22, 2010"
4.17,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Extremely delicate and openly knit head, crests at about two fingers of bleached white but dissolves faster than Carl Lewis running the 100 meters, has some lacing but this is fairly momentary too. Light yellowish color with some orange to it, looks kinda like an adjunct lager, strong beads visible within, clean hued consistently. White pepper, clove, coriander filled nose with an abundance of orange peel and blossom, a whole lot of poached apricot going on, supplemented by ripe peach, green melon and pear scents, baking glaze and pie flakes, right amount of yeastiness with mustiness, the florality remains subordinate to the spice, lavender and lilacs, more stickiness in the nostrils than lift, full and extended presence. Full-bodied, here in the mouth the carbonation able to relieve some unnecessary weight and bring tingle to the tongue. Drier feel brings the apricot back to earth, woven into the nectarine, pineapple, peach, yellow apple fruit, juicy but not possessed of tropical bite. Pepper, marjoram, sage, bay leaves there as well as something close to wasabi. The tangerine, tangelo citrus lively but dry. Too clean for substantial earthiness or yeastiness to accumulate. Cherry and a brush of honey reverberate through the finish. Can't exactly relax while sipping it, conversely not sweating you either.","farrago","Nov 21, 2010"
4.47,10.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability is certainly good, though not quite as exceptional as the flavor and aroma aspects. The complexity alone makes this an eminently satisfying beer after only a glass or two, and the mouthfeel takes a bit of adjustment. This shouldn't take away from what is clearly a great beer, however.","JohnQVegas","Nov 17, 2010"
4.57,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Wow! Fabulous beer! Look out Belgium!! This is right up there with the best. Poured with a foamy, frothy, off white head that lasts and good lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is a pungent blend of yeast, malt, fruit, grass, earth, and fresh cut hay. Flavor is similar with the carbonic acid, yeast bitterness, and malty sweetness prominant. Body is perfect for this beer. Finish has the more extreme qualities dropping off quick and the more balanced and milder qualities with a slower taper to a medium length. Session beer if I got the cash on hand.","drpimento","Nov 14, 2010"
4.35,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: It's nice to find an American made saison that's not overdone with malt, leaving it flabby and sweet; or even worse, overdone with spice or yeast character. This one shows refinement and superb balance. It's easy to drink, refreshing, and offers enough complexity and character to keep it going. Certainly worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 14, 2010"
4.63,14.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is the first beer that i have had from the stillwater artisanal ale. This is a great beer. Nice pale yellow. Foamy head. Floral notes. Not overly sweet. a slight hop. Great finish. I am also not a huge fan of Saison style beers. I have been warming up to them. I tend to like the saison styles brew in the united states rather than belgium. This beer is good.","schloozer10","Nov 13, 2010"
4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: A flavor profile this rich and only 6.6%? Amazing! This is my favorite Stillwater offering and one of the best saisons that I've ever had.","akorsak","Nov 05, 2010"

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very well crafted example of the style - though still a distinctly domestic rendition considering the hop character and use of herbs.","augustgarage","0"
4.56,13.2,5,4,4.5,5,5,"I believe this is another unique take on the saison/farmhouse style. Along with Saint Somewhere, I am starting to appreciate breweries that attempt to expand this style using unconventional ingredients. Case in point, this saison is very drinkable and I recommend it for anyone who may get bored with the usual versions of this style that are available.","Brad007","Nov 01, 2010"
4.08,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4," despite some confusion on who and what is actually brewing this stuff, it comes through as pretty damn rightous.","GratefulBeerGuy","Oct 31, 2010"
4.1,1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Another nice serving from Stillwater, solid all around with a nice and prominent touch of Sage. Not having much of an opportunity to catch it on tap or cask around the region it is great to see the bottles around now and then.","Daniellobo","Oct 03, 2010"
4.51,11.9,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"overall this was everything everyone told me it would be and more. a wonderful example of the style and just done right.","mikesgroove","Oct 01, 2010"
4.8,19.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"A great refreshing taste and crisp mouthfeel and low ABV makes this eminently drinkable. I think Brian Strumke has hit it out of the park with this one.","Beerenauslese","Sep 25, 2010"
3.75,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Hard pour into my tulip brings a five-finger head that eventually recedes down into a fairly constant single-finger layer, although it only leaves the tiniest bit of lacing behind. Nose brings forth a tiny amount of earth and hay along with a nice lemon presence. A little bit hoppy. Taste is quite the same with a bit of lemony grass and some slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite light and a bit undercarbonated. Drinks pretty well but is lacking the type of depth I expect for saisons.","Thorpe429","Sep 21, 2010"
4.37,8.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a beautiful golden yellow with a few inches of silky, fluffy head. Surprisingly little lacing. Stirring aromas of fresh cut flowers, sage and crushed mint leaves stand out, with a hint of tart citrus. Slightly sour wheat flavors complement the initial wave of pale malt flavors well. These flavors provide a solid base for the herbaceous/floral notes that follow. Black pepper, white sage, fresh cut grass and grapefruity Citra hops. The citrus notes follow through the light, spritzy finish. The mouthfeel is what makes this beer truly great. Peppery and bracing on the tongue, but soft and delicate in the finish.","DaveHS","Sep 19, 2010"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste is a nice balance of wheat, malt, some earthy herbs and grass and hops. Has a nice crisp hoppy finish, this is one tasty saison.","FLBeerGuy","Sep 07, 2010"
3.88,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"golden cloudy pour on the side of almost orange. White head that doesn't have the look of a good blonde but a hef. Not huge but sufficient. Nose of husky wheat malt and hops, mild banana and something quite dry but not clove. The white sage is quite there and leaves a nice mineral rich dryness on the tongue. Good meatiness that is misdirected by the banana quality. On the brink of american, although well placed, spiced and thoroughly hopped weissbock.","rtepiak","Sep 07, 2010"
4.19,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Very good saison. The yeast notes seemed a bit dominant only because I would have liked to taste the hops a touch more. That might have to do with the age of the keg. The herbs were a nice touch; the sage stuck out well without pushing forward too much. Stillwater's saison yeast is quite good, dry with a mild barnyard note. The hops were citric but much more subtle than in the Stateside Saison, which I prefer. The beer poured hazy and light gold with a white head. The feel was appropriate for the style, not too much carbonation and fuller than the abv would suggest. The carbonation is gentle but feels like lots of small bubbles, if that makes sense. Anyway, I look forward to trying more beers from Stillwater.","popery","Sep 06, 2010"
4.6,14.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"hazy burnt gold with a white head that holds well and leaves proper lace. citra hop stands out first, but a couple sniffs reveals all kinds of complexities. the tang of wheat, the husky sweetness of grain, the herbal pungency of sage, the spiciness of the yeast... just gorgeous. taste is an extremely well balanced mix of herbs and hop harmonizing with the grains and yeast. fantastic. quasi-spritzy mouthfeel that is far from prickly on a medium body with a long, hoppy/sagey finish that works very very well. another great beer from one of the most cutting edge brewers out there. just as good out of the bottle.","timtim","Sep 01, 2010"

4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"On tap at Raleigh Times served in a gold rimmed Gouden Carolus tulip a slightly hazy slightly dark yellow with a frothy cream colored head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is loads of spice, lemon zest and sweet malts. The taste is loads of citrus and lemon alongside a nice kick of sweet malts and spice, quite complex. The beer is very light, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable draft Saison, one I would certainly have again.","atsprings","Jul 17, 2010"

3.8,-5.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pouring a mildly hazy yellow, this beer has a nice white head with great retention and nice lacing. The nose is quite wonderful. The sage is prominent, featured front and center with a nice depth and complex aroma. The base saison appears as it warms up, with some honey, pepper and a little yeast. The palate opens with plenty of herbal sage character, prominent and spicy. Despite its strength, it doesn't get tiring. As it warms up, there's a very enjoyable honey and spice note that comes through on the mid-palate. Drying on the finish, this does feel creamy and just a hair over-carbonated. Sage lingers on the finish. Solid stuff, this is a beer I've had a couple of times already and one that I will continue to revisit.","DefenCorps","Jun 21, 2010"
3.83,-5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Had a draft tulip lass at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $6. Overall, the beer was a bit sharp and overly spicy with peppercorns, there was a lovely sweep apricot background.
