It has rewarding qualities yet parts are still challenging, especially with the ashy finish. As it got a little warmer and as I got towards the bottom of the bottle, I enjoyed it more and more.","brianmandell","Friday at 12:20 AM"

There is a little malt in the background but it has a very tart, almost cidery finish. There is also a little cidery note and Belgian yeast spice in the aroma. The tartness makes it very refreshing and combined with the body, malt, carbonation, and alcohol make it very well put together and enjoyable. Even though this comes in at 8% alcohol by volume, it is so well balanced that you do not notice it.","pat61","Jan 26, 2015"

Although some might say it is scatter-brained or unfocused, I enjoyed this quite a bit because each sip seemed to uncover something new and, interestingly, no matter what flavor crept up on my palate, it seemed to fit with the other flavors on my palate. Tasty.","spoony","Beers"

Off white head that is light and bubbly and thick (2 inch first pour, 1 inch on second). Head faded down to half a centimeter and held there. Great lacing too.

Complex even for a saison, with a wide range of flavors, all of which interact nicely with each other. I do wish it was slightly more carbonated and wouldn't explode everywhere.

This is of course stretching the imagination because when experiencing any substance, to say it is the "best in the world" you are just imagining what that would be like.

Very tart, some sweet and tart fruits, yeast and funk aplenty, but here was the one kicker that is different and it made the balance more amazing and I enjoyed the beer even slightly better than before. I bring this up as I don't know if we had a bad bottle, an aged bottle, a brand new bottle and they have tweaked the recipe since they make it "from scratch" on a yearly basis, so I've heard, but there was a musty, even smokiness to this beer. As in for a second I thought I had a German smoked beer. This taste is tucked in the background and seemed to bring out the tart and sourness, and spices, that much more.

It has some orange peel and lemon zest to it with light spicing. Wowzers the flavors are out of this world! Their are loads of every citrus fruit. There is plenty of orange peel, tangerine, lemon zest, lime zest, and funky, earthy yeast and a light tartness. They are soft and light while still being very flavorful. The most magnificent aspect may be the body of this beer. I've never seen a saison be so smooth before. It's as soft and velvety as any beer of this style could be. That makes this beer incredibly drinkable! Not to mention there isn't a hint of alcohol anywhere near this beer.

4.52,5.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"It's been a while since I've had this. It's always different every time, this time it was on the tart side. The liquid is a nice bright golden color with some trace shades of orange. Looks nice next to the candles. A good amount of off white bubbles with minimal sticking capabilities. The nose on this is straight fruit with some funky tones in there as well. Orange with lemon spritz, light spice and the faintest of baked bread. Not as crazy as some of Dany's other offerings. Being billed as 'super sour' by the bartender, this bottle had a nice tart punch, but not on the verge of sour. Has that berliner twang to it. Tastes include bright orange, some lemon twang, trace apple, light spice, thyme, baked bread and whatever else was thrown in here. All together a great mix and a very fruity slightly sour saison. Feel is spritzy with a nice twang towards the finish. Body is a nice medium. I could do a bottle of this in no time, a truely unique offering, that is different every time.","BARFLYB","May 10, 2012"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour and tart fruity aromas like apples, lemons, strawberries, honey, and some mineral/yeast aromas. Taste is sour and tart with a strong strawberry flavor up front with some spice, yeast, and mineral flavors on the finish. There is a slight acidic quality in the mouth with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good saison with a surprisingly refreshing set of flavors.","UCLABrewN84","May 01, 2012"

It tastes like apples (both sweet and tart ones), citrus, pears, white grapes, peppery spice, and a bit of funk and hay. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and easy to drink. I made the mistake of passing up this beer in the past, so I knew when I finally came across it again the other day that I had to buy it.

It coats the mouth yet finishes tart. The carbonation is a very strange experience in this brew. While it looks to be low to modest at best, it is very prickly and lively on the tongue. Maybe just a bit over the top. The alcohol is masterfully hidden in this brew, I cant believe it is 8%. This is an absolutely outstanding brew, if the carbonation was turned down just a notch it could be better. As-is, this is a must try, outstanding.","stakem","Jul 18, 2011"

4.32,0.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Fantome Saison pours a mildly hazy lemon yellow. The foamy white head comes up to about 2.5 fingers in height before slowly falling off. Substandard lacing (very spotty) is the only thing keeping the beer from looking great. The nose is pretty good, a funky brett note that only intensifies as the beer warms, and some earthy, lightly spicy hop notes are the main attraction, with a faint bit of light fruit also present. That fruity sweetness is a bit more prominent in the flavor, and it's quite good. It almost reminds me of biting into some kind of tropical Starburst. The slightly musty brett note is probably next up in terms of relative potency, and manages to take over the lead position as the beer finishes warming. That soft, noble hop character from the aroma is definitely the support player here, but adds a nice touch to the beer. The brew is surprisingly dry/light bodied for how solid that fruity base is, the mark of a truly great Belgian beer. The carbonation is similarly excellent, bubbly and lively without giving the impression of being fizzy. I've seen Fantome brews on shelves a couple times now and passed them up. After having this outstanding beer though, I won't make that mistake again.","axeman9182","Jul 01, 2011"

Pours hazy orange amber color with a 1.5 finger foamy white head with decent retention that reduces to a ring of lacing. Aromas of sweet apples, pears, strawberry, and spiciness. Very nice aromas, really fruity as well. Taste of tons of apple, pear, strawberry, lemon, and spices. Finishes with some slight tartness and tons of apple, strawberry, and spice. Some notes of fruits and spices on the finish that linger for a short period of time. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied. Very smooth drinking as well, with no alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Overall, this is just an incredible saison, and is also very interesting with the fruitiness, but is extremely drinkable and delicious.","superspak","Jun 13, 2011"

3.35,-21.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured from bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy deep orange color with a big vanishing white head. Aroma consists of light sourness and balance between malt, yeast and hops. Notes of flowers, grass, citrus, with hints of pepper too. The flavor has the same balance and acidity of the aroma and a very pronounced fruitiness (citiric and tropical fruits), and grass, flowers, hops and some peppery spiciness. Medium body, decent carbonation, very dry long finish with medium bitterness. Nice complexity and decent drinkability. I kind of expected more out of this well embraced beer. A little bit disappointing.","CuriousMonk","Beers"

It opened with a gentle pop and a gust of strawberries, honey, peach, pear and grass aromas, even before I could pour into a tulip glass. A head of light bubbles formed and dissipated just as rapidly, settling into just a scrim over the cloudy brass deceptively viscous-looking (I was wrong--it's turned out very clean in the mouth) brew. The flavor is of some dessert made with lots of yellow fruits and lightly caramelized brown sugar, with a bit of coriander or some such herb poking through. There's a wonderfully quenching and drying sourness to balance all that sweet and help the drinkability.","ManforallSaisons","Sep 22, 2010"

Initially I get citrusy tastiness (without hops) and some tasty lemon flavors. Then I get a light taste with a blend of delightful spices and delicious Belgian yeast. Finishes with a strong lemony tart flavor with a hint of alcohol. This beer has such a great mouthfeel for this style. Nice, full body with a crisp bite at the end.

Some underlying grainy/bread dough/yeast notes complete the aroma. Taste is fruits, flowers and yeast, with a nice light sour lemony finish. It tastes pretty much like it smells, a feat such a bouquet left me thinking impossible. Palate is just beautiful as well, nice lively belgian saison carbonation that is not overdone.

There is a lot going on here but I taste strawberry, peach, tangerine, and a creaminess that actually reminds me of cool whip (never thought I'd use that to describe a beer!) It's got some spiciness on the end and lingers on the palate as the flavors change. This is a beer that really transports you to another place.

This beer pours a slightly hazy straw with some yeast particulates floating around and a sizeable 3-inch head that leaves soapy lacing. As with most Fant√¥me beers, once I popped the cork, a slight sourness starts permeating the room. Under the tartness comes a slight bit of sulfuric twang, yeasty spiciness, fresh lemon zest and just a slight bit of grassy hops. The flavor is remarkable similar. Up front fresh grapefruit and lemon zest. Followed closely by spicy yeast. Just a hint of white pepper and coriander. Hay and grass underlie the sulfuric twang. A slight bit or earthy dampness. Also just a slight bit of tart green apple skins and Lemonheads candy. The mouthfeel probably is the most disappointing aspect about this beer for me. Saisons should finish dry, and for me the drier the better. This beer has just a bit of residual sweetness. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I absolutely love the tartness.

Finish is relatively dry and toasted, with lingering fruity acidic and sweet flavors. The alcohol detected in the aroma isn't apparent on the palate but this is surprisingly warming for a saison.

A touch of tart citrus is present, modestly lemon rind in character, especially towards the finish. The finish is mildly drying, though there is a definite sweet honey character, along with the citrus and tropical fruit character. Medium in body with low carbonation, this is highly unconventional and absolutely not what I expected. One could argue that the mouthfeel is a little watery too.

I have heard that the flavour of a Fantome beer can vary drastically from year to year and batch to batch, but right now I'm really digging this one. It tastes like a saison with a bit of lambic thrown in for good measure, and its drinkability is extremely high.

The aroma is tart with green apple skins and lemon. Some light barnhouse funk rounds out the aroma. The taste is of tart lemon, dry white wine, hay crushed black pepper, and light horse blanket. Not much phenols from the yeast. The feel is light to moderate, with tingly carbonation, finishes tart and dry. Must say that it is very refreshing. Not exactly what I'd usually prefer with saisons but this is very well made. I typical like my saisons a touch sweeter with more yeasty flavor but this has great balance and is very drinkable. Its tart but not to the point of puckering. Nice to finally see this available in my area and with a cork in the bottle. All previous Fantome bottles have been corkless and close to flat.","Gmann","Nov 30, 2009"

This is, I think the first funky Saison beer that I have tried. This is one beer to experience. I like the tartness and funky flavor in the beer, which give this beer a fresh vibe.

It has a nice golden body with a few floaties, a good amount of carbonation, and a two finger cap of fluffy white froth that leaves loads of lacing/sheets on the glass. It becomes more opaque with subsequent pours and foam slowly builds in the bottle as I drink. In the nose there's a soft spiciness with some light hops, citrus?, tropical fruits?, an herbal, almost woody character, a big backing of yeast and some funky, almost sour notes. Spicy yeast and perfumy hops on the palate, with suggestions of orange and honey, pear, green apple, melon rind, mild alcohol, and some distracting cork flavors. Little, if any bitterness. The body begins light, with numbing carbonation that forces it to foam up a bit too much in the mouth, but when that calms down it's more smooth and dry, approaching silky, but never losing that carbonic edge. The quality of this beer snuck up on me - it was delicious from the start, but really good by the end. The only criticism I have is the pervasive cork character, but even this seems to blend well with the rest of the flavors. A highly-recommended saison.","mmmbeer","Nov 19, 2009"

This pours a cloudy golden color, with a creamy looking white head that sticks around for a long while. Nose, as expected is beyond complex. Definite notes of grass, lemon, earth, funk, dusty horse blanket. Has a dry champagne quality to it, but also incredibly juicy, with citrus fruit such as lemon and orange. The funk adds an almost bread/onion/cheese quality to it. For somebody that absolutely detests onions, it is amazing that I really like it. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp in body. Again, swarming with complexities. Since this is not in my fridge all that often I will sip this bottle until it is gone, but alas, if this were available on a regular basis, I would be pounding this brew.

The tartness surprised me, and it seems much fruitier than other saisons that I've tried. There are some background saison characteristics with a very mild farmhouse flavor. Ripe grapefruit is also a strong flavor, but I have no idea what it's from. There are nice dry oak notes. The color of the beer is very nice, but there is next to no head or lacing. The feel is good for the flavor but a tad strange. There's a good deal of spicing in the beer, some cinnamon and cardamom. The more sediment-ridden second glass that I had verges on a very dry and wonderful orange soda. There is a significant apple flavor that I neglected to mention until now; it's close to a great apple cider in some ways.

Rumor is that the brewer changes the fruit brewed in out with whatever of his choosing. I have had the 'brewed with spices' variant so many times before and this one is more of a pineapple version. Heavy pineapple and tropical notes on the nose. Hate to say it, but the dehydrated pineapple is an upset on this one, it isn't working. I would say the labeling on the two is confusing and misleading. Stick with the 'brewed with spices' and stay clear of this one.","ballewblake","Jan 01, 2009"

Much is the same with the beers flavor, the sourness is perfectly placed atop a malty under structure and a pleasant but diminished hop bitterness, though the sour blasts appear through out the quaff it never becomes too puckering, IMO.

A good amount of sediment as you drain the glass...admittedly, not the best looking beer. Smell is very unique. Some sweet candi, ripe fruit including pears, peaches, apples and a bit of sourness to it. I can smell some yeast and a very faint hint of bread. Taste is superb. A very complex mix of ripe sweet fruits, yeast, and some tartness. The mouthfeel was very light and crisp. This is a very good beer and the ABV is hid very well.

Lemony flavors, pretty tart overall, light pepper taste, maybe some apple/juicy pear in the mix too...there's a lot happening here. On the heavy end of medium-bodied, a lot of lingering spice working overtime on the tongue, cleansing tiny little bubbles doing their thing. This is good stuff.","corey0212","Nov 05, 2008"

I wasnt expecting the nose to have such a yeasty sour tone to it with lots of fruit skins. As you take first sip you are surprised even though the nose warned of some tartness, it is subtle and crisp. A wonderful balance of bready yeast, sweet malt and crisp soured feel make for a lovely combination. This beer has tones of green apple, grape skin, fruit nectar tanins and yeasty breadieness. This really defies the style but in a good way. Mouthfeel is crisp, thick and doughy and calls for the next sip. Alchol is completely hidden. Super drinkable.","SPLITGRIN","Aug 31, 2008"

I'm tasting some bitter herb/spice jive and some yeast. There is something harsh here that I'm not into very much, but I can at least objectively identify it as some appropriately earthy/ acidic quality that some people really go for.

I know saisons are carbonated but this thing is carbonated straight up to bejesusville. Nice dry finish. Drinkability is quite good, especially for the 8% abv.

4.27,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Saw this one on the shelf of De-Vino's, an amazing surprise at a fairly irregular beer stop. Pours how a saison should. a deep orange color with a finger of white head, nice and fluffy, on top. A slow dissolve down to a thickish mass of head on top. Nice. Nose is...powerful. Huge citrus aromas, with a ton of sourness in there too, although it mixes nicely with that farmhouse, earthy yeast. Flavor's likewise. Huge citrus, yeast, and sourness. Does a good job of mixing the sourness with the citrus and yeast, not straying into the uber-sourness of the Bam Biere or other Jolly Pumpkin brews (which aren't terrible, but certainly aren't the most complex of drinks). Really a fun feel comes with the sticky sourness. There's a touch of skunky graininess in the background that keeps this one from greatness, but fortunately it goes away as the beer warms up. A delicious sour candy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lively and fun, with high carbonation and a fairly full body. Overall, a very tasty beer, one that I'm happy I tried. An unique sourness to it that melds nicely with the farmhouse funk and citrus hints.","soupyman10","Aug 01, 2008"

3.8,-11.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Fantome Saison pours into my oversized wine goblet with a hazy orange gold color and a just off white head. The head fizzles to a ring around the glass and leaves very little lace. The aroma is slightly sweet and fruity (ripe apples) with a hint of spice. The taste is rather sweet up front with a fruity touch. The finish is slightly tart, but certainly not inappropriate for the style. What is odd is the rather full body, cloying sweetness, and lower carbonation that the style would normally dictate. A bit of yeast spiciness is present and conveys perhaps a bit of a citric edge. Overall, I find Fantome Saison to be a tasty beer, but it rather misses the mark for the style. I would prefer a more refreshing and dry beer, with a strong yeast spiciness and lower sweetness. Either way, give this a try, it is a nice beer.","MSchae1017","Jun 22, 2008"

Fairly dry and clean toward the finish. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Super tasty, wonderfully rich and complex, yet light and very drinkable.

A little funk at first, then plenty of lemon and candy, with a little herbal hop kick at the end. Delicious. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, but smooth and refreshing.

The aroma is fresh, bready and citrus laiden. There's also some apparent clove and spicy notes. It's pretty complex and very inviting. Many saisons can over do the spice or have too much earthy funk, but this thing just makes you want to drink it down. The flavor starts off surprisingly tart and is warmed up with a complex spicy clove and belgian sweetness in the background. It's very dry. There's not much if any percievable residual sugars, so it's incredibly refreshing and drinkable. This is one outstanding beer. It's a bit heavier on the lactic acid than most saisons, but it works very well for this beer. Outstanding. If I could afford it, I'd add it to my list of regulars.","TheEremite","May 07, 2008"

4.33,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Served in my Ommegang brewery 10th anniversary glass. Poured a hazy gold with a frothy white head that could barely be contained in the glass. Complex scent - lemon, belgian yeast, apples and spice (maybe pepper). When I first opened the bottle, my immediate impression was chardonnay. Taste similar to nose with the addition of pear. Lively mouthfeel; pleasantly effervescent with a slightly tart, but clean finish; somewhat citrusy. Excellent saison.

4.44,3.7,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Split a bottle of this with a buddy. Extremely hazy golden brown with a thin head and moderate lacing. Looked a lot like apple cider. Smell is an in-your-face blend of spice and fruit. Fruits are both sweet and bitter. It's like smelling both the fruit itself and the rind all at once. Underneath it all is the aroma of Belgian yeast for authenticity. Taste is quite tangy. It was a pleasure for my mouth, but offered seering pain for my chapped lips. This is bad boy is complex! Spices, fruit, and yeast all over the place. It seems there is something for every region of my taste buds. Definitely a unique experience and definitely something to change people's minds about what a beer can be. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, though it fits well here. This is just an all-around solid beer, though my first for the style.","atrus138","Feb 11, 2008"

The flavor was likewise complex, probably the dominant tone was sour like a lambic, but there were spices involved as well and I can't pinpoint what they are exactly.

There is a little bit of hops present, yeast and a light sugar flavor. All in all, incredibly refreshing - very crisp and smooth with a definite pucker punch and a little bit of a warming sensation.

5,16.8,5,5,5,5,5,"After a loud pop, this pours out a beautiful brass color with tons of champagne-like carbonation, and a thick, soft whipped egg white head made up of tight bubbles. The head does not quit. When drunk, this leaves gigantic lacing all along the side of the glass. Smells like orange blossom honey, light berries, lemon, earthy funk, sweet orange, earthy, dirty hops, and herbal hops that give this almost a minty edge. Grain and alcohol are ever so slight and merely act to round this out. An acidic tartness hits the tip of the tongue initially and then washes over the entire tongue while light stone fruits, spicy yeast, and sweetbread become present. The funk doesn't jump out at you so much as it plays it relatively quiet, so as to accompany the tartness. Remains fruity all the way to the end (and on into the aftertaste) as the beer dries up and the hops come into the foreground bringing flavors of perfumey flowers, mint, and earth. Alcohol is subtle. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and very active on the tongue. This certainly does not drink like an 8% beer. It is at once refreshing and enormously complex.","goochpunch","Aug 18, 2007"

The mouthfeel is soft with a nice bit of carbonation. Again, a very balanced brew. The drinkability is excellent, with the touch of sweetness at the end making you want the next to start the dry/sweet cycle over again. The bottle is 750ml, and was difficult to get.

The aroma is outstanding. Very bright and alive with Belgian yeast and floral notes. I detect something resembling jasmine, and maybe a little lemon zest. Some spices in there too, but their identity remains unknown to me. Hmm. the taste isn't quite what I was expecting, but still very good. It's a little more restrained than I was hoping for. I wanted a bit more sourness and funk in there. But don't get me wrong, this beer is incredibly complex, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. It's very light and refreshing. Honeydew. Silky on the tongue. Incredibly smooth. Tastes mildly sweet, but finishes dry, if that makes sense. Like other Belgians I've tried, something in here is reminding me of green tea. Not sure why I keep thinking that, but it's something in the aftertaste. Leaves my tongue feeling the same way it does after drinking plain green tea. Like it's freshening my breath or something. Anyway, I am impressed with this offering, and will definitely be trying it again in the future. In just minutes, it's become one of my favorite summer beers.","jakon","Jun 01, 2007"

More echoes of that fine aroma in the flavor, but a little heavier on the aapricot and with some spritzy lemon juice and zest as well, followed by a little pleasant waxiness and apple in the finish.

Smells of citrus and some light funk hit the nose. Taste starts out somewhat tart and bitter, but a surprising lemony sweetness pulls through. Very nice. The tastes really play well off one another. Mouthfeel is smooth. If it were not for that massive head, I'd think that there was no carbonation at all. Drinkability is also grand. Like most good Saisons, this was gone in no time at all.

The head was two finger thick and foamy. The aroma was hearty, yeasty, and rustic. The taste was drier than the middle of the Sahara Desert. This moderately spiced farmhouse ale was tart, floral, and noticeably bitter. A little taste of vanilla, followed by an oak dominated finish. Went very well with some spent grain bread (from a local brewpub) dipped in Fleur de Sel butter as well as some Beemster cheese. I felt that this Saison was a little less malty and funkier than the standard bearer of the style Saison DuPont (although it does have more ABV).

Initially, I thought this would be a pain to get through, but after a while, this grew on me, as any good beer will. Totally refreshing is how I would characterize this - citrusy, apple-y, and little floral and malty. Wonderfully complex and delicious - this would be perfect on a hot day (too bad it's like 15F outside currently).

I'm willing to admit that it might have been my own taste buds that were off -- perhaps the bottle was old or I served it too cold -- but I did not enjoy it, and in fact poured it out. To me the beer was not carbonated enough (which is interesting, considering some of the other reviews). Taste was weak, insipid, dull - a pale impression of other saisons that I have had and enjoyed (indeed, Hennepin is one of my favorite beers). I may spring for another bottle one of these days, but I'm not impressed at all.","Darkale","0"

I think that this was a misinterpretation of the spices. The beer is really well attenuated and well balanced for the attenuation and spice additions. Even after it warms the strength is completely masked.

Good retention and a thick collar of bubbles that hug the glass for about a half inch above the top of the beer. Fruity nose with lemon zest, peaches, grapefruit pith, almost a sweet tart combination. There's also coriander and clove spiciness, plus a hint of funk in the yeast aroma. Big fruitiness in the flavour too, and the acidity really brings this out. There's plenty of citrus, but more like the peel and pulp rather than juice, as well as a pleasant pear flavour that's more apparent as it warmed. Sweetness is tamed by the tartness, leaving a dry finish. Spices add some depth around the middle and linger along with the citrus character. Yeast is masked, as is most of the funkiness, but a little bit of bread, grass, and earthiness peek through. Lively carbonation with a creamy texture. This is really tasty stuff. I enjoy the style overall and this is a great example of a saison. The only thing that impacts the drinkability for me is the dryness - it's fairly aggressive after a while, but still very nice.","DrJay","Sep 08, 2006"

Around 2010-11 I had one that just tasted very plain and grainy with no fruit esters, spice or anything.

Everyone who tasted it noticed a buttery flavor. Along with this are the grass and apple flavors, although the former is less pronounced than in the nose. This all recedes to a nice sweet and sour malt taste. Pouring in all of the yeast mellows the taste and makes it somewhat earthier. It's medium-bodied, mouth coating, with good tingly carbonation.

Initial sweetness on the palate is met by hop bitterness, tight spices, and then significant funk that lasts through the finish. Citrus tartness presents itself just before the hops kick in. Mouthfeel is on the thick side of medium, with plenty of mouth coating ability, refined-but-full carbonation and enough residual sugars to make this beer roll about the mouth with ease.

There is a good bit of yeast floating around in this beer's apricot body. I don't think I can pick out all of the different aromas. I'm detecting peach, grapefruit, lemon, orange, pear, pepper, herbs, Belgian yeast, and funk. Every Fant√¥me I've ever tasted has been delectable- the Chocolat that didn't taste like chocolate was the only one that wasn't amazing. The spicy bitterness, the fruity sweetness, the tart fruitiness, the funk, the floral notes- this is unbelievably delicious and it's very refreshing even though it has a dry mouthfeel.

4.57,6.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Perhaps the Godfather of all Saisons, this beer never disappoints. As soon as the bottle is un-corked, a steady flow of carbonated beer flows from the neck of the bottle and seemingly never lets up. As the beer is decanted into the snifter, it releases a dull, rusty, hazy peach color and a film of foam sustains itself atop the beer. Active carbonation puts on quite a show. Good aromas of floral, spicy, and tart. Flavors of oranges, peaches, lemons, and pears. Spiciness of cinnemon, corriander, curraco, and pepper. Vineous and almost wine-like. Remaining tartness that doesn't become astringent or sour. Tartness weaves into out out of the fresh spicy hop bitterness and flavor. Light malt with wheat sweetness and texture give a much needed breadiness and creaminess. Soft texture that is slightly scrubbed. Medium body. Dry finish with mild phenolic alcohols throughout. Well balanced and easy drinking. Generally, I can expect Saisons to show a bit more sweetness but this one is as dry as a bone.","BEERchitect","Aug 23, 2005"

The best smelling/tasting beer I've ever had. Smells very much like tropical fruit and bubblegum, with a little bit of sourness in the mix as well. It's a very sweet smell, but somehow not cloying in any way; in fact, it's downright alluring. Tastes initially lemon peels, citrusy and sour, with a sweet bubblegum finish. Again, I can't explain it--you would naturally think that a bubblegum beer would be awful, sweet to the point of undrinkable, but this was not. It was perfectly balanced by the very pleasant sourness, and had a very nice, dry mouthfeel. Fucking amazing beer.","battlekow","Jun 29, 2005"

I'm getting some freshly cut grass in there as well. Taste brings more fruityness upfront. Really fresh whole strawberries and watermelons. More of a floral element comes in with a garden vegetable taste. Yeasty depth underneath. Spritzy in the feel. I'm tasting the carbonation a bit. Finish is dry and holds well.

Fortunately it was my first beer that I had, so it was clear that I really enjoyed it, but when I woke up this morning I couldn't stop thinking about this beer and had to buy another today and try it to really give a 100% acurate rating. I was thinking of giving it straight 5's (that would have been a first for me), but wavered a bit on the appearance and the mouthfeel. Overall it's an incredible beer that I will be having many more times in my future. I am getting married in September and am narrowing down my list of beers to bring with me. This will be one of them and it may very well be the one on the main table getting consumed as everyone toasts at my wedding. It's not an everyday beer though. This to me is a special occasion beer. This falls in the same category of Stone RIS for me. It's too good to have for just any random beer craving. A most awesome crafted beer that has gained a big spot in my heart. Worth $10?? Hell yes. If any of you are wine lovers, take this into consideration. A great bottle of wine will run you typically at least $30-40 minimum. This is a truly great beer and runs you $10 on average if you can find it. This is worth the money. Seek it, buy it, drink it and savor it.","GClarkage","Dec 28, 2004"

Lemon, acid, slight pepper, grapefruity citrus. Damn. All I can say. Nirvana. The nose was great...the flavor was perfection. There is an underlying mandarin orange sweetness that is overlayed with huge lemony citrus acidity and peppery notes. There is a whole lot more going on in there, but I couldn't put pen to paper and give it justice. Suffice to say it was orgasmic. The feel was right below moderate, exactly where it should be. My only issue was that I was drinking it in the dead of winter, when I thoguht it should be a summer brew. The drinkability is second to none. I could have parked my glass under the tap all night and just drank this. If I ever find it, I will be forced to see if I can get a keg for home.

I'm just glad that I can appreciate a beer like this when apparently I used to think "it could use a little more punch." Nah, the subtleties are where it's at for this beer.

The sourness is melded with sweetness, hints of lemon and berry, maybe rhubarb are permeated throughout the taste. Somehow complex yet accesssible. Defintiely the best of its class that I have tried thus far. Will probably be a summertime favorite as I think it would pair exceedingly well with grilled seafood. A yard worker's delight.

Poured out a hazy golden color with lots of yeast floating around everywhere. Lots of fruit hit the nose, apples, pears, grapes with some hints of yeast and spiceiness, just wonderful. Taste consisted of fruity notes mixed in with some peppery spiciness with a very tart-like finish, but everything was controlled nicely.

This reminds me of some mead homebrew that I once had. It's not the roller coaster of other Saisons. It's an 8% ABV beer that hides its strength with its fruitiness. I'll give it another walk as a food beer; probably pairing it with lemon chicken. As a session Saison it is somewhat boring. I can't help but compare it to DuPont which (in its Vieille Provision of 6.5%ABV ) is more of a strong session beer for me. Fantome is more refined, stronger, and more consistent from start to finish. This is actually a boring Saison by itself.

If this is a tainted bottle, then it is just starting to show the signs. Still a great saison and definitely a testament to what saisons are all about: rustic, complex, ever-changing, volatile. The great thing about this little brewery is that they can keep cranking out this artistic little gems even if most Belgians haven't even heard of them. I'd venture to guess that the US demand for Fantome beers is a large portion of thier market. It's a shame it's not more widely appreciated in Belgium.","GreenCard","Dec 10, 2003"

Mixed aromatics; green apple, candied blood orange, mango, pineapple, white pepper, a smidge of pine, and yeasty righteousness- very impressive. Tastes light and airy, despite it's ABV. A bit of yeastiness shines through it all, along with the citrusy and tropical malt & yeast profile. Goes a little bit tart in the middle, but brings it back to the sweetness. Has a strange "wet dog" characteristic that only shows when sipping, not in the aroma (not offensive, however). Hops are there, but don't play that large of a role in this beer. I like this saison very much. Effervescent and crisp. Quintessential summer quaffer.","crookedhalo","Nov 21, 2003"

Aroma: First thing is the pineapple juice aromatics that come out here awesome, a bit tart with mild alcohol notes in the background. Taste: Very clean and estery fruits light and fluffy tones the perfect summer ale, I definitely am amazed by the fruit tones this beer produces exotic tropical juice with some peppery notes with the yeast dregs added it takes on herbal tone with spices arising and grassy semi-musty tones it's very nice I'm a fan.

4.45,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Certainly one of the strangest (in a good way) beers I have tasted to date! First off, the beer poured an awesome, hazy, very unique color-a shade of very light caramel with some orange and golden hues. The aromatics were extremely complex with peach, citrus-orange and lemon-some spice, coriander perhaps? The aromatics were so very insidious it was hard to stop smelling and take a drink! In the mouth a lovely jolt of bright citrus, especially grapefruit zest, followed by some orange and lemon. The ever present bitter grapefruit zest component was very refreshing and unrelenting! As the beer warmed a bready/ fruitcake flavor surfaced and added to the flavor profile. I paired this with beer batter catfish, and a bit of leftover fried rice oddly enough. I used a simple belgian white-witekerke for the batter. This was a nice match, and I will say that I will search out, with celerity, my next brew from this brewery. Cool stuff here!

The color was a golden-orange with a thick tan head. It has a super fruity, medicinal aroma with the hay-like qualities of a lambic. It has just a really fresh smell. The aroma is more complex than any other Saisons I have had before. The flavor is fruity and medicinal with a different spiced flavor that I have never had before. It is light on the palate, but full and sneaky. This is a complex beer in aroma and flavor. A definite top notch beer in my opinion. Excellent.","BeerBuilder","Jun 13, 2003"

It had the consistency of a sticky rich whipped cream. It lasted fairly long, ¬Ω glass, then, eventually fell to a ring around the edges. It produced a sticky lace that clinged the sides of the glass and stretched almost the whole way to the finish. The aroma was of a giant fruit market, fresh fruits everywhere. I nosed bananas, pears, apples, sharp grapefruit, fresh melons, strawberries, sweet honey, floral hops (lite as it warmed), spices (cloves, pepper), and yeast. The aroma was alittle on the tart side but not sour, balanced nicely. Let‚Äôs just say that my friend who is a macro drinker loved the aroma. The tastes that came from the glass were just as pleasing as the nose if not more. Flavors of strawberries first hit me, then bananas, then a whole cornucopia of fresh and tart fruits, then spices (pepper, cloves), herbs, floral hops, some earthy flavors, yeast, tad wisp of alcohol, and a hint of a malt. Ends fruity with a hint of hop. Medium bodied. This is one smooth and complex beer. I would never expect so many flavors out of one little glass.

3.95,-7.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Maybe an adolescence spent sucking on Warheads and chewing crybabies killed my ability to perceive sourness, but I didn't think this was sour in the least. First pour was clear dark gold with nice white fluff. The second pour was cloudy. It seems hard to keep the yeast out of the bottle, but you might as well feed me yeast as much as I like yeast in my beer so that's not a problem. The dominant flavor and aroma is the estery fruitiness. Ripe plums, melons and bubblegum make for a soft, thick front. The middle is a mild bitterness and ends with a lingering crisp malt. Reminds me of spring. It has some of the same aromas I remember from the back yard of my parents' house beside the horse pasture with the Jonquil flowers and pecan trees. The horse blanket is there in the tiniest degree but I'd say it's more like the inside of the horse shed where the hay and horse feed dominate the smell of tackle. Not an earth-shattering experience but I like this.","aracauna","Jan 21, 2003"
4.79,11.9,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"An apple juice colored brew on the first pour from this 750 ml bottle. What an appropriate color... A medium-sized but thick head forms on top, and retains well. Second pour: looks like an aquarium that hasn't been cleaned in months, even though I Ieft a good amount in the bottle. Floaties galore. If you don't like yeast sediment in your saison, leave quite a bit of this in the bottle. Wow, the aroma! Very unique and powerful. Super-tart sour apple and candi sugar, making it similar to a sour apple candy, like others have said. Some barn-like or "horse blanket" aromas are present as well. Spicy yeast undertones too, almost Christmasy. The taste, although very different from the aroma, is also unique and wonderful. First in at the front are malt and yeast characteristics. The maltiness is bready and caramelly. The yeast provides some spiciness and more of that sour apple and candi sugar, but it's much more subtle here on the palate. As the beer gets closer to the back, it gets more hoppy. That muted hoppiness that is present in many Belgian-style beers. You know what I'm talking about, right? Now I'm starting to think in musical terms describing this. You know what that means? It means that this is a damn good beer, and I love it, therefore it's influencing me to be more creative with my review. Anyway, back to the description. The tart fruitiness stays all the way through as an undertone. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, almost sticky, which fits with the sour apple theme. Smooth and thick finish. This beer says "why didn't you buy more bottles of me?" to me. It's expensive, but it's definitely worth it. I may have to cheat and forget my rule of buying only beers I've never tried before next time I'm on a beer run. Give me more, now!","hyuga","Jan 19, 2003"

There was a very fruity, tart nose, like apple Jolly Ranchers with a little bit of farmhouse funk thrown in for good measure. This was an extremely delicious saison. It was fruity and tart, but not puckeringly so. For balance it was lightly hopped and had a noticeable pale malt sweetness. That sweetness is important to me in the flavor profile of a saison, and some beers have too much or too little.

Over ripe cantaloupe or cotton candy come to mind, malt underlies it all, a real treat for the olfactory senses, the front ambrosial, the top thick and sweet.

Very spicy and tart in the mouth, but not bad.  It kind of grows on you.  A little bit of an acidic tinge.  I get a sour apple like taste.  One that makes you pucker rather than wince.  (And unlike the sour apple associated with a "green" beer.)  I'm not sure what kind of spicing they use (if any), but maybe something like cinamon or bitter orange peel (curacao).

At first pour, the head is immense, and the incredible carbonation ensures that the head never goes away. In fact, the carbonation was almost volcanic in appearance; there were three separate mini-tempests in my glass from the eruption of bubbles rising through this brew. How to describe the smell? Imagine walking through an apple orchard in autumn while holding a ripe pineapple to your nose. Farm fragrances abound. The taste? Slices of green apples in apple cider, with a healthy amount of pepper and coriander. Spicy, earthy, intoxicating, complex. Oh yeah, this is the stuff of life.","mophie","0"
4.47,4.4,4.5,5,4,4,5,"The turbid, light oranged hued brew is topped by a formidably thick, dense whipped cream like head that leaves intricate lace.  The luscious aroma is comprised of sweet apricot and peach fruit esters as the dominate components, w/ slightly tarter strawberry and citrus notes secondary. Subdued green apple acetaldehyde exists as an undertone in aroma.  Buttery malt becomes perceptible as the beer warms as well.  Bittersweet dried citrus peel is perceived initially, then yields to fructose - like sweetness mid - palate, while a combination of light sour dough breadiness and coriander round out the taste.  Curacao provides most of the bitterness in this brew, since hop bitterness is very mild.  Although highly carbonated, there's sufficient residual dextrins and protein for a relatively smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes quite clean, w/ peppery notes briefly lingering.  Fantome Saison is a highly enjoyable brew.  It's got tremendous complexity, yet remains soft overall on the palate.  Unparalled in drinkability.","marc77","Beers"

Hints of peach, tea, cinnamon, other tropical fruits but grounded so the sweetness is kept in check. Have been craving Hitachino Nest all day but this really did the trick.
