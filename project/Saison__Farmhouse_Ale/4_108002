It's highly quaffable and refreshing to boot. This would be a fine choice year round, but it would make for an especially good summer slugger.","ryan1788a5","Nov 11, 2014"

The nose comprises lemon zest, mild pineapple syrup, coriander, light cracked wheat, Belgian yeast, and a hint of cobweb.  The taste brings in more of the same, my tongue enlivened with strong veins of tropical fruits and mild spice rack denizens.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a rather tasty saison.  Straight up.  'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Aug 27, 2014"

Light yellowish liquid, slightly washed out but it has good shine, lots of active bubbles fill the glass, snow globe level fullness. While the nose has some brine and pickled aspects, opens into softer floral notes with sour white citrus and clove, coriander citrus, there is bubblegum but it never quite enunciates strongly, the peach, apricot and curiously pineapple fruit scents crushed into the whole, ends with a yeast, dough elevation. Medium-bodied, the carbonation lives up to its visual impression and churns through the mouth, especially creamy attack. The tangerine, white grapefruit citrus plays a big role. Fewer flowers, more grains and metal shavings, these push back the banana, bubblegum and lees aspects to the end. In the end it is bit too tough minded and lacking in flow, however, the basic elements are there and the funk seems to be managed for maximal approachability by the widest group of imbibers.","farrago","Aug 07, 2014"

Still, Allagash knows how to do some Belgian styles. I'm a bit surprised the only recently started brewing a saison.","LambicPentameter","Jun 25, 2014"

Allagash Saison is running on all cylinders: It smells really really good. The flavor is balanced and complex. The mouthfeel is pretty exceptional. Its a classy beer that is a great stand alone on hot day to quench your thirst or a perfect companion for snacking with cheese & crackers or your beer to go with a full course meal. I am definately grabbing another 4 pack of this beer very soon because the other 3 bottles from the 4pack will not last very long.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jun 18, 2014"

(Some may say just a little too "safe". To that barb I retort: MY LEVEL OF CONCERN IS AT ZERO.) Allagash has created of beer of exceptional balance–its tart citrus, peppery spice, herbal, and grassy flavors work in concert to produce a decently complex flavor profile. And all of these flavors are complemented by the excellent carbonation level, smooth feel, and dry finish. Very enjoyable even though it does not push boundaries.","hagbergl","May 28, 2014"

I'm usually a fairly big fan of Allagash, but this one just didn't hit the sweet spot for me. As advertised, it's quite herbal- and I think therein is the crux of the problem. It's simply too herbal. One dimensionally herbal. Herbal without a balancing citrus, or white pepper, or funk component. I like my Saisons a little more balanced, and with something a touch sour or peppery (or both) to balance them. Fantome comes to mind as one that does that well with virtually all of their Saisons- a nice balance of citrus (or funk, or both) and herbal notes- often with a peppery accent. This Allagash Saison is all herbs with just a watery slightly sour aftertaste. It lacks crispness on the finish and interest throughout. A disappointment.","Georgiabeer","Beers"

This was great at having the sugar and spice of a Belgian beer with a fair amount of American hops, making it a hybrid of sorts. Tasty and unoffensive, this was something that I enjoyed and would love to see brewed more, since it was unique enough to stand out amongst the Hefe's and Belgian Whites that are so popular this time of the year.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 31, 2014"

Lingering sweet, bitter and pepper on the finish. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a tongue piercing bubbly mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite.

Light bitterness and fine, even carbonation stir things up. Slightly dry as well. Flavors are very well integrated together. Bubble gum, lemon candy, mild sprinkling of sugar cookie, rosy kind of floral. Very nice. I get sick of the various off versions of this style but Allagash hit it just right.

Peppery, spicy citrus, lots of yeast, slight fruitiness, earthy hops. No added spices, no barrel aging, no Brett, Allagash just brews a standard Saison and lets the yeast do the talking.
