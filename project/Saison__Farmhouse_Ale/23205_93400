Much more complex taste, especially as it warms.  The mimosa-like citrus qualities and lively, champagne-like carbonation play real well with the barnyardy brett funk.  The mouthfeel is crisp, clean, and refreshing.  I would seek this out again and again.","adapt313","Mar 16, 2015"

Head manages to lace pretty consistently. Nose is first and foremost quite tart. Lemon and lime right off the bat. more tart than funky. Pale malt sweetness. The flavor is lively, crisp, and refreshingly tart. Tart lime, lemon, and cider or champagne. Brett! Atad of pale, malty, bready sweetness. Carbonation is intense and uplifting. More body and feel than I would have expected once knowing the ABV and specific style of the beer. Never will complain when I get my hands on some Vermont royalty.","VelvetExtract","0"

4.23,-4.5,4.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Bottled 05 2014 and served in a Hill Farmstead stem at 51 degrees. Pours a translucent honey-gold with a frothy, one inch, bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a film. Delicate strands of lacing adhere to the walls of the glass during the tasting and copious tiny bubble are present effervescing in solution. Nose suggests lime, orange zest and herbal/floral notes. Taste consistent with nose; however, the citrus manifests more as tart orange co-mingled with lime. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a pleasant, even acidity. Incredibly bright and refreshing. Overall, nice complexity despite lacking the rustic qualities I tend to associate with the style.","Jwale73","Aug 07, 2014"

Very light farmhouse funk and moderate yeast presence with a touch of peppery spice in back. Taste follows the nose, extremely refreshing especially on a hot day. A good bit of citrus and lime with a nice balance of the farmhouse yeast and a faint pepper in the back. A bit sweet and could use some more farmhouse characteristic.

Juicy aroma, fresh hops and lots of citrus, stone fruits, yeast. Lots of flavor, lemon-lime, peach, orange, moderately tangy, grassy funk, Belgian yeast, light crackery malts in the background. Didn't get any hibiscus at all, though there were some herbal notes in there. Medium body, prickly carbonation, nice drinkability. Very nice overall, and probably the best offering from Grassroots.","Rifugium","Aug 04, 2013"
