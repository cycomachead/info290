Every sip is a gamble, always feel like you are tasting the wonderful yeasts that make the magic happen because godisgood. I'm not saying this is a perfect beer, but each individual thing I'm analyzing is damn near perfect to make me happy! SO GLAD I took a gamble on this. For some reason Siason is kind of hard to find.","iRaven99664","Mar 29, 2015"

Pours that murky hazy pale sunset fog that makes me salivate... The aroma quickly reveals the funky characteristics I so crave. The taste delivers. Funkier, fruitier, and more delicious with each sip. Refreshing and satisfying. A must enjoyable bottle and glass to linger over. Orange and pineapple, maybe a little past ripe, dominate the finish. Velvety smooth but undefined mouthfeel. This beer makes the day better.","NateF90","Jan 04, 2015"

The nose is soft and complex with lots of floral notes, lemon citrus and hints for farmy Brett.  On the palate, this beer really opened up as it warmed; it featured again lots of floral and spice notes, lemon peel, white pepper, some nice Belgian yeast flavors and more and more Brett as it warmed.  The body was smooth with a nice carbonation keeping it light and refreshing.  A really nice version of the style, complex and enticing.","mtomlins","Sep 21, 2014"

This is a prime example of how farmhouse beers in America are only getting better, and when everything is done properly towards a beer's profile, the addition of Brett only makes everything more complex, rustic, and unique. I really wish I had another bottle to see how it's progressing, but I honestly think the sweet spot is 6-8 months. Terrific, wonderful stuff.

The farmhouse yeast of earthy mushroom and pepper comes in mid palate and plays through the back. Strong carbonation and a clean crisp body with a dry finish make this very palatable.

Aroma of saison yeast, citrus, sour apple, funky. Flavor is citrus rind, brett, sour apple, coriander, peppery spices, finishing with acetic sourness and light bittering hops.. Light bodied with nice active carbonation. A lot going on here, lots of sour citrus fruit and a moderate amount of brett. A bit too sour for me, but should please tasters who like a tart bretty saison.","LiquidAmber","Oct 06, 2013"

The mid-palate has a moderate floral character (rose hips, a little bit of jasmine). The earth/mushroom flavors from the Brett are, at this point, light, complementary and delicious. Drying on the finish with a mild oak tannin bite that works really well with the saison base, there are also flavors of lemon, a carbonic acid touch, and floral flavors. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is mostly great, but does feel a touch watery at times. Still, this is an exceedingly enjoyable beer. Refined stuff.","DefenCorps","Sep 13, 2013"

I really enjoy this style of beer from both breweries and it's clear that Shaun's vision came to fruition here, a really palatable saison that is both earthy and rustic, but a little wild. While it doesn't offer up much in the way of over the top complexity or risk taking, it's very refined for a simple, straightforward saison. I do wish that there was a woodiness to it, which is a great signature of both breweries.","kevanb","Sep 03, 2013"

Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, hazy, golden wheat coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body and a clingy, bubbly, chunky, bright white head that has a decent retention around half an inch. Nose of buttered biscuits in the backbone, with floral highlights, toasted grains, and a subtle dose of spices, including pepper, orange zest, and coriander. Flavors of sour and tart forward, with an acidic undertone. Citrus tart profile follows, with a heavier spice blend of coriander, all-spice, pepper, orange zest, and another solid shot of sour. The aftertaste is citrus and sour, with a slowly regressing boldness. The finish is tart and tangy, with a slightly drying feel and spiced linger.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours bright yellow-gold. Quite cloudy. Solid white head. Good sized layer of foam. Good retention, some lacing. The aroma has fresh grain, dusty barnyard, some light stone fruit, lemons. Lots of brett presence. Clean. The taste adds in more oak than expected. Big acerbic woodiness, particularly in the finish. It’s mostly pleasant. Lots of clean brett flavor. Some apricots and citrus peel. Mouthfeel is lively and light. It’s almost a touch thin for my taste. Very good saison but a touch boring with so many others coming out. It could just use some sort of twist to stand out.","popery","Jul 18, 2013"

4.17,2.2,4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4,"Moderate but distinct Brett flavor. Some peppery notes. Pleasant, delicate fruitiness with more of the barnyard funk. Just a little pineapple and some pear flavors. The modest bitter aftertaste is just right for the light body and dry edge. There might be a faint woodiness, but I don't taste the alleged oak tank fermentation without some imagination. Still, this is a delicious and restrained example of a Saison, and I like this Brett version rather than the often over-the-top yeastiness. From the 750 ml bottle bought for $14.10 at Bottlecraft in San Diego.","mactrail","Beers"
4.09,0.2,4,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"Remembrances from last night when consumed right after La Vermontiose. No where near as dry as Vermontoise on the back end with a more floral, fruity characteristic. The beer pours with a thin head for a Saison that rapidly dissipates for a saison without much lacing left behind. Some barnyard, but not wholly pronounced as much as a sweetness that disappears as the beer warms, switching to the more dry saison character.","N17shelfside","0"
