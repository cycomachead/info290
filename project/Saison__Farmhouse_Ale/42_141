It hides its potency easily, and the dryness and crispness of it make it very refreshing and easy to drink. Perfectly balanced too. A standout brew.

Can clearly smell the sweet orange peel but it's the taste that's gonna keep me coming back. Until I find one to better it, the Hennepin is my new go-to saison","Mikefriedman90","Jan 04, 2015"

Smell: pear, pepper, lightly grassy and lemony, with notes of unripe banana and something a bit oddly vegetal (like sprouting garlic). Checking the label I've never realized how many extras they throw in... don't see any expected offenders, but there is that odd out of place note. Taste: boozed ripe pear, mild whole-grain-bread graininess, lemon peel, significantly peppery with some really mild orange-ginger mix in the finish. Initially slick then fast growing carbonation hits, gets to be a little too much, then fades slowly into a crisp-ish but not dry, and slightly sticky, finish. Packaged 3/14, best by 3/16. This was my first "saison" many years ago and it's definitely an enjoyable beer... throttle up the gravity a bit and it's a killer BSPA... but for the style it advertises it's not great, and very reliant on the adjuncts.","babaracas","Jan 04, 2015"

4.9,18.1,5,5,4.75,5,5,"For about 3 dollars a bottle, this beer is cheap in comparison to other Belgian beers (normally 5 and up), however it doesn’t lack in complexity and character. It is owned by the same company that produces beers like Duvel (another favorite) and Achouffe, so that’s another perk of known quality! This would go well with many different food pairings. I think pairing this beer with something equally spicy would work well such as some excellent cured meats like hot coppa or soppressata.  Again, for the price, this beer is my go to! The only thing that isn't perfect is that as the beer warms up it gains a slightly more present alcohol hit (amplified by the flavor of raw ginger) that detracts from all of the other great flavors. It isn't terrible, however, I did have to mark it down for that reason.  However, I still give it 98/100 points!","DaverCS","Dec 17, 2014"

It is a high ABV (7.7%) and you could drink several easily.  They should change the name to Thor's Hammer!  Really tasty and light.  Definitely a true Belgian style saison.

Aroma and Taste is of citrus, wheat, some mild spicy hops, yeast with a light lemon twist, light fruity notes upfront. Palate is a medium body, crisp and refreshing mouth feel with good carbonation. Finish is sweet biscuit malt, citrus flavors, some wheat, yeast and mild spicy hops on the end. Overall a very good, refreshing and enjoyable summer time brew.","Samp01","Sep 26, 2014"

The taste is very vibrant in the mouth and consists of several zingy citrus fruits, a light hoppy character in the middle with a reminiscence of wheat grain, and finishes beautifully in a cascade of flavors that dance around the mouth well after swallowing. Personally, not my kind of flavored but a lot of care and attention has clearly been put into the brewing process for this one.","18CGL","Sep 08, 2014"

4.05,-2.4,,,,,,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. A cloudy golden yellow with a white head that starts large but quickly settles down to a comfortable half-finger. Very malty, fruity, spicy aroma: Fresh apples, hay, light grapefruit, breakfast cereal, pungent coriander seed, white wine, and just a touch of funk. Palate is correspondingly fruity yet quite dry. Robust rich malt backbone coupled with the fruit and spice notes mentioned above, subtle nutmeg and cardamom, citrus (lemon and grapefruit rind), shortbread, and a hint of rock candy sweetness. Body is thin to moderate, with carbonation on the low end. Quite a wonderful saison, not as tart and bitter as some, lacking that dry "burlap sack" note, and yet redolent with yeast phenols and esters plus added hop bite.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 27, 2014"

Aromas of pears, apples, peppery notes, citrusy notes, a touch of earthy and floral hops and some of that barnyard funk. Taste follows through with citrusy orange notes, mild peppery tones, floral hop flavor, tart apple and Belgian fruity yeast flavors. Mouthfeel begins creamy with ample carbonation that finishes super dry. A great saison, one to have again for sure.","HopBomb515","Jul 31, 2014"

It has malty, wheat and hops infused taste, with strong accents of orchard fruits. I t has a malt aroma that fades quickly and goes down smouth and leaves the mouth dry.

This has to be one of the most underrated saisons brewed in the country - and I'm at guilt myself, as I've spent so much time running after the more hyped or limited ones while this would gather dust on shelves wherever I'd go. Highly recommended for saison lovers - a domestic offering that's up there with my favorites from Belgium.","magictacosinus","Feb 23, 2014"

While 7.7% abv isn’t super high, it’s a good fraction higher than your average beer, and this beer carries the load with no stoop in its shoulders, a trait I must always commend. If this serves as an exemplar for saisons, then for me that means I ought expect a sort of musty, wheaty Belgian ale with a casual attitude towards carbonation. If this beer were cheaper it would be highly sessionable, but as it stands, while enjoyable, I probably wouldn’t pay $10 for a bomber again when I can get my hands on top notch Belgians, Weizenbocks and Hefeweizens for less.","abeeronthebeach","Nov 10, 2013"

Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with a couple inch frothy white head that sticked around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like bready malt/grain, coriander, cloves, peppery spice, orange peel and bananas. The brew tastes like bready malt/grain, cloves, bananas, ginger, orange peel, and some pear and sweet spices. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high but soft carbonation so it's easy to drink. I liked this brew a lot. I've had Hennepin in the past, but it's been a very long time since the last time I tried it. I don't think it will be as long of a wait until the next time I drink some! $7.49 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Sep 28, 2013"

This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, pretty refreshing, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these easily, I think it's a great summertime Saison. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it had pretty much everything that I look for in a good Saison. What I liked the least about this beer was the how little the farmhouse aspect showed up, i wouldn't mind if it imparted a little more funk and typical Farmhouse flavors. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Saison, it's a little pricey but it is cheaper than Saison Dupont, but I don't think I would buy this all the time. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Saisons. All in All i was pretty impressed with this beer, I wasn't so impressed with their Belgian Pale Ale, but this beer turned out pretty damn good and I'm now a little more interested in checking out more of Brewery Ommegang's Lineup. Good job guys, I really enjoyed this Saison.","StoutHunter","Aug 21, 2013"

I was really looking forward to this after mowing feeling like a farm laborer. Man, this hit the spot and was ever so refreshing. Thoughts kept going towards how this really compares to Saison Dupont, my first saison. I just love a beckoning saison like this on warmer summer sunny days-good memories to have.","joeseppy","Aug 07, 2013"

4.45,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Hennepin is my everyday favorite from Ommegang. It’s a lighthearted, somewhat prickly farmhouse saison. Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a great big head that lasts. Laces well. The citrus is not as prominent as some saisons but it’s there, and it’s not sour. Earthy flavors lend balance to the forwardly floral hops. The malt exudes a tender sweetness that’s somehow masculine. A great saison, easy to drink, mellow, a little peppery. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. In the glass this beer is equitable and upright. Bravo!","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours pale, golden yellow with a lot of chunks and carbonation bubbles circling around. The beer pours with a nice tight white head on it that settles to a quarter of a fingers width and leaves a thin lacing of tight, dry bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells strongly of spiced coriander with hints of orange peel, and ginger. There is also distinct bananay yeast in the background giving lovely character to the nose, while the hops and yeast are properly downplayed with lights notes of grass and hay and some wheat notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes creamy sweet and grassy bitter with lots of spice character. The flavor begins as orange peel and light wheat malt before being steamrolled away by heavy coriander spices with hints of pickling ginger. This moves into bitter grassy hops and banana yeast. The finish gives a fresh kiss of coriander infused orange juice with just a hint of sweet wheat bread before mellowing into an aftertaste of light coriander spice and yeasty banana funk. In the mouth, the beer tastes creamy smooth and medium in body with a touch of fierce carbonation that mellows into a clean scrubbing of the tongue. The mouth is left slightly dry but clean. Overall this is a solid and interestingly flavored beer. They’re a little heavy handed with the coriander spicing, which hurts the other flavors, but these flavors still show through and are beautiful and fresh in feel. This is a classic American saison in a Belgian-style. Worth a try.","Maxwell","Apr 05, 2013"

Taste is of baked bread, lemon peel, yeast, cloves, sour fruit, black pepper, and some earthy wet hay. Has a medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and a dry, slighty bitter, champagne like finish.

And while it doesn't feature anything particularly adventurous, creative, or outlandish, it's still quite a pleasant beer and a wonderful introduction to the style. That I would recommend either Hennepin or Saison Dupont to those who have never had a Belgian-style Saison is a testament to how well Ommegang's creation stands up to the imported examples of the style (Saison Dupont being a paragon of the Saison style). Good stuff and a worthy buy.","hagbergl","Jan 20, 2013"

4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O - I love the saison/farmhouse style and ive had many from its home country of Belgium. For a long time now American brewers havent truly understood this style of ale. Ommegang don't pretend to brew in a Belgian style but they actually do brew solely in a Belgian style. They give American craft junkies a true Belgian saison brewed and bottled right here in the United States and Hennepin holds true to the authentic farmhouse style. If you want the best American made saison then this is the one. American brewing has needed a farmhouse ale to give the great Belgians a run for their money and Ommegang's Hennepin is that saison we can call our own knowing it can compete.

4.7,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the Gold Standard for Saison/Farmhouse in the USA as far as mass producers are concerned. Some micro out West might have a better one, but as far as a Big Time producers, this is it. Everything is right on. Smell, appearance, and of course taste. It has the classic Belgian esters you get with the Farmhouse yeast strains. Everyone is out to make an "Americanized" Farmhouse/Saison by going big with the gravity or the hops or more unfortunately, both. True Saisons are not overly hoppy and are modest alcohol % with just enough hops to keep them from going bad too quickly. This one is a bit on the high side alcohol-wise to really be a real traditional Saison, but it is otherwise on the money. Saisons were brewed to refresh the seasonal field workers in Wallonia, and the brews were generally 3-5% so the workers could have one and still finish the job. 7.7% is a bit too high to be a true traditional Saison. Still, if you don't like this beer, you don't like Saisons.","95stategrad","Oct 21, 2012"

There are aromas of biscuit from the malts as well as those typical spiced and fruity Belgian ale aromas like coriander, lemon, and pear. The beer definitely is spicier in the taste that in the nose. The coriander is more intense and it's somewhat peppery. Those fruity flavors are more intense, being pear forward. The hops on the back end provide some bitterness for balance. The body is medium with strong carbonation. The finish is very dry. For the style, this is solid.

The nose is light and yeasty. It has nice white orchard fruit character, like sweet apple and pear. The flavors follow suit. It has a light, slightly sweet fresh fruitiness to pair with the light and off dry Belgian yeast. It's very well rounded and has great flavor. It drinks light in body with a little too much carbonation for a saison, in my opinion, but it really doesn't detract from the beer at all. This is a light, easy drinking saison and you don't detect any of the 7.7% at all. I can't believe I waited so long to try it.","aasher","Aug 29, 2012"

The beer does seem slightly more watery than the 7.7% ABV would imply, but at the same time, the relatively high ABV is very nicely hidden, creating a strange contrast. Furthermore, the banana/clove and sour notes slightly overly dominate, especially if several sips are taken in quick succession. Still, this is a very nice beer.","jondeelee","Aug 10, 2012"

There is a touch of fruit there too. The taste is great with lots of floral, spicy hops and fruit esters. I don’t get the banana some other folks talk about, more of sweet fruit.

4.48,8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by 5/13/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts. Some nice and dense soapy lacing clinging on the glass. Aromas of huge lemon, pepper, grass, clove, herbal, floral, grape, orange zest, coriander, earth, light funk, and herbal yeast spiciness. Absolutely fantastic aromas that are extremely balanced with nice complexity. Taste of big lemon, pepper, herbal, floral, orange peel, grass, earth, bread, coriander, slight funk, yeast spiciness, and slight tang. Nice herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, citrus zest, pepper, bread, floral, herbal, earth, and yeast spices and tang on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance of flavors; with a perfect contrast of the malt sweetness and peppery spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a slightly slick and fairly crisp mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with no warming noticed at all on the finish. Very easy to drink. Overall this is an absolutely world class saison. Extremely balanced with big complexities; and very smooth to drink. Definitely one of the best I have ever had.","superspak","May 31, 2012"

Though there's some raw honey sweetness as well, the taste overall is nice and dry, lemony, and herbal, all very well integrated in the mouth. Smooth stuff.

The flavors are all clean, but blend nicely towards the finish for a more robust and full flavoring collectively. Paradoxically, the flavors do muddle towards this end, but in a nice, balanced way. One negative is that the carbonation is painfully too much. This is a great representation of the style overall.","TheBrewo","Jan 27, 2012"

Smell is of grain, spices, and Belgian yeast. There is also a bit of an unknown fruity aroma. Taste is of grains, spices, fruits, and some Belgian yeast. There is a slight funky bitterness after each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel.

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from bottle into dogfish head snifter. Golden color with huge thick white head and tons of lacing on side of glass. Smells very floral with some citrus notes and cinnamon. Taste is citrus with very mild bitterness. Nice carbonation. Overall this is very nice and easy to drink. My first of this style.

Once it settled the beer is pale and cloudy in appearance due to the yeast sediment. A hoppy crisp taste pleasant to drink, the beer belies its 7.7% ABV. Overall a very good Saison, worth checking out.","Clembo1957","Dec 21, 2011"

A good-tasting beer, easily quaffable - might be one of the few beers I preferred while it was a little colder - it had a brisk character that compelled me to take real hearty swigs as opposed to, say, thoughtful sips.

3.88,-6.5,4.5,4,4,2.5,4,"The beer is a reddish amber with a cottony white head that sticks around leaving fine lace. The smell is a little herbal from the hops, spicy from the yeast, and bready from the malt. The beer tasted good, but it was definitely undercarbonated which keeps the aromas in the beer and out of my nose, but it kind of also ruins full appreciation of the beer. This was carbonated more like an English Pale than a farmhouse ale. The beer wasn't as fiesty and zippy as the bottled versions of this beer, which are perfectly carb-ed. That said I think this beer develops in the bottle a bit and it might be the micro-oxidiation (along with carabonation) from the bottling process that adds some earthy and fruity flavors I remembered in this beer that was not present.","Soonami","Aug 26, 2011"

A lot going on in the nose with this one. It is dominated by yeasty esters like bananas and cloves but there are also lemon and peppery spice as well. The taste is classic saison. Fruit, spice and clean crisp grain. For the fruit I notice lemon and other citrus the spice is mainly light pepper and a bit of clove and that is all rounded out by nice pale malts. The mouthfeel too is good. Lively carbonation with a super dry and clean finish that manages to leave a touch of sweetness that invites the next sip. The alcohol is well hidden but does sneak up near the end of the glass. Overall a very good example of an often under respected style.","fank2788","Aug 21, 2011"

It amazes me that a beer this refreshing and balanced can pack a 7.5% ABV wallop. Mouthfeel is really smooth and balanced- not much more you could ask for here. Overall, this is probably the second best Saison I've had, and the best from the USA.

I'd say the flavors are even fairly homogenized, but it doesn't really matter. This a very clean representation of the style, and it most certainly should be had with food. Stir fry, steamed greens, and light salads would do awesome here. You wouldn't even need to put pepper on your salad -- it's already in your glass.","Cavery","Jul 27, 2011"

Very easy drinking with a low alcohol impact despite the conflict of listed abv on the label. Regardless if it is 7.5 or 8.5% abv, it drinks like it is half of that. Exceptionally balanced, this brew has gone through quite a transformation I actually enjoy it more with age on it than a fresh offering. Nice.","stakem","Jul 25, 2011"

If I was stuck on an island and could only choose one beer for the rest of my life...it might be this one. The yeast flavors don't really hit Saison head on for me...and I think they might dry it out with the sugar rather then a traditional Saison yeast...but it just all works so damn good together.","nppeders","Jul 19, 2011"

Pale banana and citrus malt fill the tongue, nice mild cloves and ginger spices float around.

The taste is complicated, its yeasty sweet at first, citrus, lemon, and then it ends with a nice slight hoppy, spicy, peppery, dry finish, very refreshing.

The taste to me has a tart sour apple flavor followed by a peppery spice that adds to its complexity. I didn't expect this complexity when I first saw it poured. It finishes a little dry and has a nice and light mouthfeel. The alcohol is hidden well and I could drink more than one of these in a sitting. This is a perfect brew for this 95 degree day.

No need, these notes still capture it. Amazing that this can be brewed in two distinctly different locations with the same results.

The aroma is spot on. Ripe fruit comes to mind first, kiwi, bannana, green apple, and peach. You also get some nice bread/dough flavors in there as well. The taste follows the nose almost exactly.

Flavorful: citrus, lemon juice, wheat, some table sugar, hops come thru towards the finish complimenting the light fruit with some dry and bitter. Esters of banana and clove appear and bring subtle booze along as an aftertaste. Medium bodied with zappy carbonation and a slight cloying of flavor.

However, the flavor did not have much depth and the only aftertaste was about a second of sour on the very tip of my tongue.

Good carbonation and a nice big head top the beer. Aroma is tart and fruity with damp straw underneath. Taste is honey sweet - almost surprisingly so - followed by a refreshing lemon dryness. Crisp light cracker malt can be found in the middle of the beer, with a light peppery phonolic finish that's dry and leaves you wanting to drink more.

It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall thiswas a pretty decent and easy drinking brew. It was not overly complex, but still pretty nice for the style. I had this one a long time back and the spices just overwhelmed me. Really glad I re-visited this one. If it were more complex, this one would definitely be great.

It tasted mildly sweet and yeasty with a slight acidic tinge at first and ended with mildly bitter yeast flavor and had hints of citrus, and other spices with the flavor lingering on the palate for a nice while.

The farmhouse ale I had wasn't that great. However the ommegang hennepin isn't like the other one I tried. It's light years beyond the first farmhouse ale I tasted. It has a beautiful gold color with a hint of haze. The initial bite is like a strong german beer but it quickly wanes into a mild, smooth earthy taste.

The first sip left a strong impression of pears that receded with subsequent sips, unraveling a sparkling apple cider note with a trace of soapiness and lichen on the finish. For having so mellow a flavor, the beer was surprisingly crisp and thin. In fact, I would have preferred a slightly heavier feel, but perhaps my opinion was swayed by a craving for warmth on a chilly day in February. Well, I found it thoroughly drinkable nonetheless and look forward to sampling it again when springtime rolls around.","anap","Feb 09, 2011"

4.35,4.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bright yellow with a faint haze and some floaties. Maybe a hint of amber. Thick, frothy white head. Smells earthy, spicy (cloves), and somewhat medicinal. Hints of alcohol.

Definitely worth a try if you like this type of ale.","CaptDavyJones","Feb 03, 2011"

Peppery spice with banana and clove on the nose that leads to a nice peppery forefront and sharp bite on the palate. I just ate onions on my sandwich though. I feel a faint grape like mouthfeel in the back and finished spicy and slightly alcoholic. Overall a nice beer to have with any occasion.","jmfc8237","Feb 03, 2011"

The head leaves fantastic lacing with big clumps of head on the sides of the glass. Aroma has a slightly skunky hallertau hops note with a bit of soured fruit and a really nice farm funk.

It is still extremely drinkable and lighter, something I have come to expect from this beer. It's kind of cool to see how this beer compares to a newer vintage. On second thought, the beer has gained more of a champagne-y taste, a very delicate balance of sweetness, bubbles, and a little dryness. Very cool.

The smell is a very nice yeasty balance with some nice citrus to it. has a nice hopness aroma in it as well. Taste is an amazing acidic but nice citrus taste. has a good balance of bitter and sweetness to it. its very bubbly in your mouth so it is a nice warm feeling.

HOWEVER, I should note that I think I opened the bottle too soon after taking it out of the fridge. The second glass that I had was better than the first, and some of the things that I look for in a saison (biscuity, spicy, funky, and citrusy) came out slightly as it warmed.

Bready, sweet tones with just the right combinations of lemon zest, clove, coriander, and white grape without too much funk like many saisons. Taste was even more impressive, with all the aforementioned flavors and a champagne-like dryness, especially in the finish. Clean, light-bodied in spite of the abv, and bubbly, it accentuated the flavors nicely- I wish it came in a bigger goblet there, because I had to take small sips to really enjoy it for all it's worth.","BDJake","Oct 27, 2010"

4.11,-1,5,4,4,4.5,4,"D/O- At 7.7% the drinkability gets dinged a notch because it's such a distinct taste. I don't think anyone would want any more than one or two of these. That being said, those one or two would be the best looking, if not the best tasting beers one would have that night. Another winner from Brewery Ommegang.","Duff27","Oct 24, 2010"
4.07,-1.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer appears to be a hazy golden color with a coarse white foam head. The beer smells of pears, crisp red apples, sour white grapes, mango and slight cinnamon notes notes. The flavor is a mixture of old champagne, slight flavors of orange, and grapefruit and some peppery notes in the back. This is a nice complex beer and it's not too harsh on the sour which is one thing that I tend to avoid as far as the style is concerned. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for my liking it is quite prickly in nature. The remainder of elements for the mouthfeel are rather nice still. It drinks well, it was the right price, not a bad Saison for my money.","Vdubb86","Oct 24, 2010"
4.06,-2.2,5,4,4,4,4,"The appearance of this beer is quite fabulous. It's crystal clear and the entire vessel is teeming with effervescence. The color is a light shade of yellow. The head is huge and white, containing a plethora of bubbles. As it fades over an hour or so, it coats the glass in sticky lacing. The aroma is of spices, straw, grass, lemons. The taste is better than the aroma, with notes of lemon grass, orange zest, clove, lemon, straw. There is a subtle, spicy kick in the finish. The beer has a nice feel, with an above average carbonation level. This is a great saison, and from the United States, no less. I definitely recommend it.","Huhzubendah","Oct 23, 2010"
3.69,-11.1,3,4,4,3.5,3,"D - I enjoyed it but it was strangely more of a sipper than something i couldn't put down, which is unusual for me when it comes to saisons. I think the balance was slightly off. Overall, I enjoyed it but its not something that I would look for in the future. I think I was hoping for something else, probably something comparable to what I've had in other saisons (in terms of balance at least). Perhaps its just a different style saison, perhaps I need to branch out a little more. A good beer but not a great.","micmillon18","Oct 21, 2010"
3.83,-7.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Takin' another swing at this brew. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a solid finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, coriander, and lemon zest, with a touch of minor caramel in the very, very back. The taste follows along a similarly-landscaped path, though there's more wheat and a touch o' relatively minor funk hanging around the corners and edges and whatnot. And when I say minor, I mean AA, maybe even A (who doesn't love watching a Dunedin game, am I right?). The body is a very light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry finish.

One of the better American renditions for sure, but the malt seems a little sweet and not grainy enough, while the lemon feels more like an American wheat than a saison. Hop bitterness is spot on and provides a nice cleansing on the palate. Tough love I guess, as saisons are one of my favorite styles and tend to grade harder.

4.23,1.9,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours opaque straw gold with a dense, dense puffy white head that eagerly leaves lacing all around the glass. Initially smells like rock candy, and then the more familiar Belgian saison yeast. Fruity and floral with a small amount of farmhouse notes and vanilla. Tastes great, haven't had this in a while. Fruity and sweet with a clean malt bill and mild hop presence, dry but could be plenty more for the style...again there is a vanilla like candy thing going on and I can only imagine it is from the yeast. The more I drink this the more I think that vanilla thing is actually just some phenol type flavor. Wow great mouthfeel, awsome bottle conditioning by ommegang, other than the fact that this beer is almost 8 percent (and you can't tell it is) it is highly drinkable.

3.9,-6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Wonderfull appearance. All rocky and vibrant head and pale effervescent beauty. the smell is dominated by the malt and some alchohol with little to no contribution from the hops. The taste is sweet but not cloying, as it is wonderfully balanced by the mild hop bitterness. there is almost no flavoring hops. Just a little bitterness to keep the sweet maltiness in check. The body is pleasant and satisfying, medium mouthfeel. There is a faint hint of alchohol, but is not too astringent. this beer is very drinkable and goes down very easy. this is interesting scice this is a 7.7% beer ( a litlle to strong for a saison). It is stilla very wonderfullly balanced farmhouse ale that is a very good interpretation on a beloved style.","Trapiste389","Jul 16, 2010"

4.41,6.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Fairly long pour needs to be done in two stages. The first attempt results in a massive rocky white head that takes its time subsiding before I can continue. Haziness lends a bit of depth to its pale straw hue. Nice lace. Very pretty looking beer. Creamy mashed banana aroma; peppery, medicinal phenolics; and floral hops. I get a whiff of lemon and hay in the background. Lots of over-ripe banana in the flavour too, also quite peppery with a little bit of lemony tartness. Musty and earthy, when it gets close to room temperature. Noble hops and a mildly bitter finish. Medium bodied with a enough carbonation to keep it feeling light in the mouth. Has a little bit of warmth from the alcohol. Just a little. You barely notice it's there. Very approachable and easy drinking. I found myself having to consciously think about pacing myself as I drank it. Though it may sound odd, it reminds me of a hefeweizen in some ways and a tripel in others, and thats not a bad thing.","mintjellie","Jun 28, 2010"

Keeping with the Caribbean theme (which is very subtle)there is a creaminess which combined with the pineapple flavor reminds me of a classic pina colada.

Strong spices dominate the aroma, Belgian yeast, clove, some flowery/spicy hops. Flavor is sweet upfront and followed by more driven spices and an alcohol warmth. Its light-medium bodied with a prickly carbonation.

3.58,-13.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours out like lemonade, hazy yellow that looks very dilute. Has an explosive head that goes up to about three fingers and dies down to about one and retains at that point very well. The color is not that attractive but I think the haziness is due to me pouring in some of the sediment. Other than that the appearance is pretty strong. Smell is a mix of Belgian yeast and malts, some fruit (apples, bananas) and a bit of sour. The overall strength of the smell is a bit weak and I start to pick up more and more alcohol as I drink it. Taste is pretty much the same as smell. Belgian yeast and malty flavors, fruits (apples, bananas), alcohol and some sour. A tiny bit of hops. It is stronger than the nose and pretty much just a solid Belgian flavor. It eventually dies down to a very dry almost rye like taste with alcohol, the loss of flavor is disappointing. Mouthfeel is pretty suitable. The carbonation is medium and the body is pretty light but a bit creamy. Not really watery at all. This beer is pretty warm for 7.5%. Drinkability would be better if the alcohol did not take over and the flavors did not die. The price is not that great for how much I liked this beer. Maybe I'll try it again after I have some more Saisons.","cbutova","Dec 02, 2009"

4.35,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Just poured this from one of the 750ml bottles. It has a nice and soft golden yellow color with a strong head that slowly dissipates as it sits in the glass. Upon the first sniff I get a slight, slight malt fragrance accompanied with citrus. When drinking while smelling there is a strong hoppy aroma as well as a nice hoppy and carbonated dance on the tongue. As it goes down the hatch, I get a crisp, burst of citrus followed by a final goodbye of hoppiness. The taste left in the mouth is a battle between hops and citrus, with the victor eventually being the citrus. Indeed it should be served a tad bit out of the fridge as I think it helps battle the strong carbonation. But my goodness is this beer smooth, delicious and oh so good to the last drop. Hennepin, we will be seeing each other soon.","dougriddle","Nov 11, 2009"

4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The taste starts slightly shrp and acidic, but this quickly settles down into a lightly alcoholic fruitiness with herbal-peppery-spicey bite, yeasty dough. The herb has a juniper quality along with otherwise leafiness and grassiness. There is a light earthy hint throughout. It has light sweetness balanced by the bitter-spicey-acidic bite so ends up rather dry, but not too dry.

Its quite a bit more subtle and all of the flavors kind of meld together in a nice sequence of mouthfeel and flavor at the same time. It has wonderful looking floaties that look great when held up to the light. Has a more understated mouthfeel than the non cave aged version and is much more pleasant to drink.

Hennepin has managed to capture the essence of the Belgium brewing style. A smooth blend of fruit, sour, and muted bread flavors that perfectly mask the relatively high alcohol content. I recently had one of these while watching Rick Steves give a HD tour of of the Grand Place in Brussels - perfect.","lramsey48","Jul 31, 2009"

The taste starts somewhat sweet with the spice and fruit upfront, followed by a somewhat tart taste finishing with a malty taste. The mouthfeel is very smooth, some alcohol content detected in the aftertaste, but overall a silky beer with nice balance.

The aroma is spicy and fruity with hints of yeast. The taste does not let me down. So fruity and delicious. I love the spice mix. It's like a piece of bread with cinnamon butter spread on it. I found the mouth feel to be pleasing as well. Not too thick. Seems right for a saison. I think this could easily be a session beer.

The nose has a grainy straw-like character that I find to be pretty common in belgian style beers. There is a nice structure to the flavor. The foam on the head lends itself to really "creaming up" the mouthfeel.

I'm sure there are threads in the forum on the subject, but if I was forced to pick a single beer to be stuck on a desert island with, this would be the one. Pours a hazy, yet bright gold with a tinge of orange. The head is nice and fluffy with plenty of carbonation oozing beneath. Smell is somewhat typical to the Belgian style yeast with hints of lemon, grass, and a touch of bubble gum. I don't know how to explain it, but you do get a sense of earthiness in the smell and taste. Taste is magnificent. The 7.5 abv is unnoticeable. I think saisons were typically made in the winter to be enjoyed the following summer, but it would take more willpower than I have to wait those precious months for this beer to mature. Thank goodness for modern refrigeration! Also, I've read a few reviews perhaps complaining of too much carbonation, but I feel that it is in perfect harmony with this brew.","alkemy","Apr 16, 2009"

On first swallow, all I get is a real earthy taste, with a little green apple/pear, a little barnyardy, but it isn't until a couple seconds have passed that the flavors of the beer really come out. This is when the tart funkiness starts to come out, not so much as some beers I've had, it does't really taste like "horse blanket" or anything like that. But it is deliciously tart, and the tartness stays on the palate without the dank earthyness. Very light body, crisp and ephervescent. I'd say it's only off-dry, not as dry as some others I've had, and that is a positive impact here. After a bit it starts to stick to the tongue. I can see why this is such a well-regarded saison. Everyone should give this a go, especially when the mood for something lighter strikes.","damienblack","Mar 29, 2009"

Taste was awesome, with more of the same flavors and some wheat and bubble gum flavor mixed in. Very light on the palate. Didn't even notice the abv. Very easy to drink, as a saison should be.

A bit phenolic but not in a bad way. Tastes completely different than SD but is still out of this world. Tastes of a rich blend of green apples, pineapples. Finish is quicker and dryer than SD, and doesn't punch you with citrusy zest. Hennepin is pretty suave. I'd consider SD's equal except that its body lacks that electric tingle owing (I assume) to less carbonation. This beer is fabulous and proves once again that Ommegang is an amazing brewery.

Enough hops to make their presence known in the backdrop. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch too carbonated, though that is fairly typical for the style. Smooth and refreshing. Alcohol barely noticeable.

Some yeast and bread, typical of many Belgians, with that funky tartness (a good band name?) and sligh kiss of grassy hops. The mouthfeel was light.

And all the reviews of Hennepin are pretty accurate concerning appearance, smelll, etc. But one reviewer said "The beer finishes with sweet notes and yeast". I'd say it finishes with a bitter over hopped taste that lingers until you brush your teeth. Now you serious beer guys aren't going to like this, but in the spirit of keeping the gravity, I cut this ale with Keystone Ice rather than flush it. I'll stick with the Ommegang Abbey Ale. Like I said earlier, I can't disagree with the myriad of excellent reviews of this offering from Ommegang, if this style suits your taste.

A yeasty aroma is most dominant with light fruits (banana, pear, apple, peach) and a bit of white pepper. Taste is like the aroma but a bit stronger. At first it is creamy and mild with a light maltyness but then pears, peaches, and some light bananas take over. As we near the finish a peppery spicyness becomes more pronounced and builds through the finish. There is some occasional heat here, seems to be from the spices as it doesn't seem like any other hot alcohol I've taste. Doesn't seem too dry despite being well attenuated.

Taste is way to strong on the alcohol. Thats all you taste up front. Creamy body with a lot of yeast and a lightly hoppy and lightly bitter finish of spice. As a western take on a saison though, this works pretty well. Lingering notes of Caramel and Vanilla and a very slight sour note redeem this one.","Rootdog316","Oct 04, 2008"

The flavors are quite good, herbal hops, some balancing malts, a raw honey sweetness, assorted spices I have trouble putting my finger on, ALC esters as it warms. Complex and challenging. The dry finish has hints of almonds or roasted chestnuts. So deep and so well formed I would never have guessed it was American. Let alone so newly crafted. This beer tastes of tradition and pride.

It poured with a nice and thick 1-finger head in my St. Bernardus chalice which sustained itself, leaving some awesome looking lacing in the glass (you could even see the levels of each sip I took). The smell was straw, pale malt, and slight alcohol warmness. The taste was amazingly well balanced and smooth, which went through a series of phases before it subsided. This is the best example of a saison that I have tried yet, and I now understand why this style is so highly regarded. This stuff is great. The mouthfeel was also excellent in its smoothness and perfect carbonation. I drank a 750 by myself, and I could have easily downed another, if not two more. If you see Hennepin on the shelf, make sure to grab a bottle (or 4).","PiecefulToker","Jun 17, 2008"

The nose is similar to a Belgian Wit; phenolic with banana and cloves, slightly peppery, maybe some coriander. Taste is similar; there is a slight biscuity flavor about it with the slightly sweet, peppery cloviness coming to the forefront and being countered by a moderate bitterness of hops and alcohol. The alcohol has a slight warming effect but isn't overly noticeable in flavor. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, slightly aggressive carbonation.

Taste is upfront with sweet pale malts, switching to some spiciness and light fruits, and a crisp light close. Not really any sharp edges here, probably the cave-aging at work.

The beer poured into my 211/8th fl. Oz. snifter with an enormous head. It shortly subsided with massive lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose was heavy with hints of yeast and sweet grass.

The smell is aggressive earthy Belgian yeast, sweet and a little fruity, a banana-pear character. The tiny bubbles lend a creamy texture to the mouth feel. It has a light-medium body. Full flavored, the earthy malt and fruit character of the nose is true to taste. There is also a spicy note about it that lingers nicely. A real nice drinker.

Sweet fruity smell -- makes me wish it was a warm weekend instead of a cold January. Tasted somewhat sweet but not too sweet. Also some wheat/grain taste with some spice...maybe clove. Great flavor that isn't any too stong on one flavor but still different flavors to each mouthful. Easy to drink and a pleasure to drink. Wish it was a six-pack as opposed to a four-pack...","StoutBulldog","Jan 29, 2008"

It has an interesting mouthfeel with a crisp flavor. There are hints of spice, grain and a tiny bit of hops in a sip. The finish is dry but its light enough to be drinkable. When thinking back on my first experience with this style, I remembered enjoying Dupont more. However, I'd have to try it again to explain what I liked about that brew. Although considering the quality I was surprised to see this was a domestic beer. I have a feeling I need to try more Saisons to see if my bias is against the style rather than the brewery.","jenbys2001","Jan 27, 2008"

Clearly some strong spice in here as well. Great hard saison taste. Very pronounced wheat and yeast flavor with good peppery spiciness. This is no Dupont but it is quite good. At this point the haze is starting to fade a little bit from warmth, but is still very present. Flavors are becoming earthier at this point. The aftertaste has some nice banana notes. The mouthfeel is slightly abrasive on the tongue, but overall quite good. Drinkability is solid on this one, and is impressive.

This beer has more distant aromas then any other I've had. There is Nutmeg, coriander, earth, yeast, bread, and a plethora of others that I just can't name yet because my nose isnt refined enough yet. I definitely need to return to this beer later. Taste is spicy, lots of nutmeg along with cinnamon and allspice with an earthly, alkaline taste to boot. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a bit of carbonation. An oily residue coats your mouth with this earthy goodness. Great beer.","hwwty4","Jan 05, 2008"

It smells quite like fruits and citrus such as peaches, bananas, and oranges. It also has a somewhat spicy wheat aroma to it. The taste is sweet and fruity like the smell. Not a lot of hops with just a small bitterness to round it off. It has smooth mouthfeel that isn't real thin and watery but isn't thick and syrupy. All in all, it is a very good drinkable swill.

The taste is at first tart, but mild fruit esters and a strong phenol spicyness comes through and then diminishes to expose a lovely malty backbone. This beer is sharply carbonated with a moderate body. Despite its subdued flavor profile the tart-spicy-malty transition is infinitely interesting to my taste buds and I find it draws me to that next sip before I really get to understand the first.

The taste is very refreshing with fresh fruit flavorings coming to the palate including apples and lemon with a certain earthy graininess coming to the back of the palate, and a sweet malt profile makes itself known as the beer warms a little more. The mouthfeel is interesting due to the high carbination in the beer. Very refreshing and inviting in the mouth, and it doesn't leave a very heavy coat in your mouth.

In short, its short on foreplay, more of a quickie as far as taste. I did like it, and would pare very well with just about any cheese, some nice artisan bread, cured meats, seafood, a nice salad, etc. I'd definitely drink this again in a heartbeat, but if given the choice between this & others of the genre would probably pick the others.

I'd say a slight step above the coveted Local 1, but I am just not a big fan of the flavor or category. I hate to ruin the rating, but I don't think every beer should have coriander!

Doesnt seem to complex, but still full enough to deliver. Less than medium smooth mouthfeel. Low enough abv. and full flavor definitely makes for a few of these in one night.

Aroma is very nice and spicy upfront. I detect raisin, clove and mild apple flavors. A second sniff of the aroma brings up an apple pie flavor and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Taste is much of the same as the aroma except that the spice is more pronounced and the apple flavor seems to be dominant. Goes down very smooth. This is more of a sipping beer as well.

4.62,11.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml, corked and caged into a tulip glass. Pale honey and straw in color, with a persistent thin lacy head. A touch cloudy, to add that element of mystery. Smells of lemons, apricots, with a medicinal note in the background. Beautimous. The taste is sharp and crisp, almost bitter. There is a silky maltiness that holds it all together nicely. The finish is malty and dusty, but not too dry. The aftertaste is spiced fruit. I can only say :) The mouthfeel is slippery and tingly. Always a good combination. The drinkability? Pour me another! The alcohol is a plesant warmth as it trickles down the throat. Nothing off-puttish and the flavor balance makes you want more. And now I'll have more.","roblowther","Sep 12, 2007"

The smell is very floral-biscuit but there is a sort of caustic overtone, something medicinal, of alcohol perhaps. The mouth finds a peppery introduction, very nicely carbonated and active, but the major flavor I detect is one of licorice. Bitter but very smooth and full bodied. Yeast presence is there but I can't get past this anisette quality that isn't really my favorite, and it aggressively overwhelms the taste buds right to the back of your throat. Quite dry but generally refreshing. I don't pick up hops or malt. It is something different and definitely a quality brew but this, like many other Belgian styles I've tried thus far, isn't right up my alley. Recommended for a try, this might be really special to the right palette.","Durge","Aug 15, 2007"

2.71,-34.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"The 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass a cloudy yellow orange colour with a snow white head probably three inches thick. Looks nice. Smell was good, but rather off for the style, I thought. Smell was more akin to a tripel than a farmhouse saison. The damp, musty, basement smell present in nearly every saison I have ever had is totally abscent in this one. Taste, too was far from a saison, IMO. Also, likely the worst thing about this is the detectable level of alcohol. To me, a farmhouse saison should be smooth and easy drinking, smell like a mouldy, damp basement, and have a rather pronounced tartness. This is bereft of any of the afore mentioned traits, and again, if I were just given this to drink, not knowing what it was, I'd probably enjoy it and exlaim, "I've had better tripels, but this one's not bad.." I don't know guys, for all the hype surrounding this one, I must admit, I'm quite dis-pleased with it. Perhaps I got a bad bottle.","SilentSabre","Jul 26, 2007"

Aromas are passion fruit, pears and some berries, strawberry with a nice non-overpowering alcohol smell in there. Taste is great, the same fruits, some pineapple. Very smooth, somewhat dry and earthy, which must be the hops showing through. Saisons are a great beer, and to find a state-side brewery that does it this well is quite a treat. Go get some now!","saintwarrick","Jul 23, 2007"

The taste was extremely light with the co2 rolling around in the mouth. Slightly spicy flavors, but very subtle. Finishes very crisp and clean.

Flavor wise it is incredibly flavorful with all the Belgianness you could want: tons of funky overripe fruits, a bit of grass and hay, with a tight dry finish. This sample is a bit cleaner than Belgian saisons, especially Dupont and Fantome, a trait I find in many American Belgians.

Solid, densely-packed white head of good duration and with fine lacing, a full finger easily. The nose here is worth the price of admission, with the rare spiciness of the yeast verily prickling at the nasal passages, inviting wet horseblankets and dull fruity malt components up for drinks in the wee hours. Better than I remember in this regard. Equal parts tangy and sweet on the first sip, coating the tongue and promoting a sense of degustation; where's that sampler platter at? Pale malts sing the high notes in the background as the middle is cajoled through the wheaty-meaty bits, and the zest of the yeast parying a bit in the foreground, but not quite asI remembered from my last go-round some years back. Dry around the finish and with enough hop aromatics to make you notice them, but even for the stylistic interpretation that is Hennepin this is a rather tame component. Not a small beer by any means, it drinks so easily you'll forget where you left your car keys if you're not lucky. Some lemon rind peaking through here and there, but nothing to be overly offended by, and in the end this feels a bit tame overall. Still, this is the first time I've had it on draught, and seeing as how it's back it won't be the last. I look forward to another go . . .","Chaz","May 05, 2007"

4.4,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours out a shimmering and slightly hazed gold with lots of bubbles in the body and a thick, frothy, fluffy head that maintains its size and clings to the side of the glass, leaving elaborate lacing patterns. Aroma starts off with a sweet mix of vanilla, jasmine, apricots and sweet oranges, with underlying bready and grainy smells. Alcohol is in there but doesn't detract too much. Flavor starts with a bit of grain, but underneath it is a malty, bready, and slightly nutty body. Belgian yeast characteristics are there with the fruity esters with a definite apricot presence. Hops add a great floral touch that really expands in the aftertaste. Finishes dry and rather clean. Only thing really detracting here is a warm alcohol presence which I'd rather not be experiencing. Mouthfeel is incredible. Isn't at all weighty from the alcohol level. Bubbly in the mouth, but not overly prickly: just enough to bring out the subtle flavors. Pretty drinkable, but I just wish the alcohol presence were a bit more subdued.","goochpunch","Mar 16, 2007"

It is a lovely bronze color with a thick white head with the prevelent carbonation of any good belgian style ale. Smells interestingly sweet and sour and the same time. I got hints of candy as well as a slight musk. Upon first tasting it was apparent that this was a belgian at heart. Sweet candy malts on the front, but a bit of hops came through later. The biggest taste left with me after each sip was of a sourish funk, and I mean that in a good way. Very unique, as this was my first foray into the saison category. Wonderful mouthfeel and highly drinkable. I actually paired it with a southern style potato salad on zesty vegetable crackers and that really brought out the flavor.

The white head is nice soapy and rocky, that left some real nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is not very strong, it kind of reminds me of a pilsner, with the noble hops. The taste is of Belgian yeast, tart apple, some sweetness and finishes with a slight bitterness to balance the flavors.

Fresh green apple smell and a different sweet fruity smell also. Inviting smell that leads into similar tastes. Didn't know what to expect with taste because this was my first saison, but was impressed. Champagne-like dryness and fizziness. Sourness of like, a white grape thats not quite ripe.

When I first tried this beer before I didn't really like it, but the recent trip to the brewery changed my mind quite a bit. The beer is supposed to taste rustic and earthy, and in furthering my beer appreciation I think I respect this beer a lot more now. At a small bar in town I drank it all friday night (and it sure does sneek up on you...) I couldn't get enough of it. It changes so much with temperature being more grainy and earthy at colder temps, then warming up to a huge array of citrus, spices, and hops. This beer is awesome and next to the Ommegang it is now my 2nd favorite.","Rudgers73","Feb 04, 2007"

I poured it into my Delirium Tremens tulip glass and it was a golden yellow color. It had a tremendous head with bunch of initial carb that settled into a thin foam with great lacing. The aroma was spicy and fruity but just a little too subtle to be a 5 but it's close. The mouthfeel was perfect was for me - it had a great creamy feel with a tongue tickling from the carbonation. The taste was also perfect. It's sweeter and less dry than some other saisons I've had which is perfect for me since I favor sweet over dry.

Tastes a little sharp as well, but not necessarily in abad well- kinds a more stinky cheese flavor. Complex, with ripe, musty flavors and some subdued stone fruit. Fades to a more typical saison light yeastiness on the end. Decent body, good balance between creaminess and crispness, but finishes a little limp.

3.8,-8.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Bottled sample via trevorwideman. Gold in colour with lots of floaties (that's ok... yeast is good for you) and strong carbonation. Aromas of over ripe banana, vanilla, meadow flowers, white grape, and spicy pear. Flavors of lemon rind, soft fruit, spicy Duvel yeast, some wheat malt, and a slight metallic at the end. Smooth in the mouth with some nice lively carbonation creating some interest on the dry finish. Overall, this is a mellow and technically sound saison, but for me it lacks that certain something that makes a beer really special (like the signature funkiness of Fantome or the austere refinement of Dupont). Perhaps this sounds like damning with faint praise, but it's still a VERY good beer.","fisherman34","Dec 28, 2006"

Later in the glass fruit characters gain in strength with some honey sweetness and notes of vanilla and banana. Mild carbonation and a light, airy mouthfeel.

Plenty of carbonation left on palate for an active mouthfeel. I didnt get the alcohol notes until about 1/2 way through the glass, then my palate opened to it and I could taste it then.

The flavor has a nice malt character that well supports the hop and citrus flavors. The body is medium/light and mouthfeel is round and pleasant.

Nose is sweet and with a citrusy tartness. A bit of an earthy smell as well. Taste sweet at first, lots of fruit flavors are perceptable- perhaps a bit of apple and grape, finish is tart with spicy citrusy hops and a touch of warming alcohol. Very good and distinct. Very well carbonated. Excellent overall. Refreshing yet powerful and full bodied. I think this would be equally good on a warm summer or cold winter evening. A beer for all seasons.","burnstar","Sep 04, 2006"

Some yeast notes and citrus notes in the smell. The taste is very powerful with strong maltyness followed by citrus and yeast notes with hint of coriaander and lemon.

I don't recall the exact age, but I recall emailing the folks at Ommegang and they told me that this beer would age well... Anyway, the sedond time, I had this i in a log and it was more current... I think I preferred the first, older, version... This is just an unusual style... Sweet, carbonated and notes of honey. I dinged it a little bit for mouthfeel - I think you can sense the carbonation and relatively high alcohol... Even so, I just like it...

Pours a bright, glowing golden hue, but is slightly cloudy or hazed below the one finger foamy head. Smells Belgian (uh oh, I think), yeasty, sweetish, and only gently hoppy--not too much smelling going on here as it makes me nervous and the aroma of Belgian beers make me think of dusty cellars by association... Okay here I go...tastes fruity and complex--fruity in a white wine kind of way. Nectar like. Has waves and layers of flavor. Definite alcohol presence. Starts with the fruit-like malts, flashes alcohol, adds a flair of spice, and finishes with a juicy, fruit-zest hops lingering on the tongue for a moment or two. I'm not in love with the taste, but it's intriguing. Mouthfeel is full but on the tongue sits slightly watery--more so than expected, I expected more syrup, but it is pleasing. Not sure how I feel about the carbonation level..a bit high. Drinkability wise, this is nothing I'll swoon over and plan my day around, but it's a good beer that seems it could go well with the summer bread, cheese, fruit, and spiced meats kind of picnic.","Liquids","Jul 20, 2006"

Much like the nose, it tastes of bananas, yeast, honey dew melon, some spiciness that would be expected from this genre of beers, just party in my mouth. Mouthfeel is decent, creamy yet maybe a little too carbonated. For a 7.7% brew, this is EXTREMELY drinkable - even TOO drinkable.

Taste is a delicious sweet pungent flavor, a little bready and yeasty. the 7.5% is extremely well hidden. It is extremely smooth and refreshing, I could drink this after a run and feel satisfied. I had this beer for the first time last year around this time. It was my introduction to the style, as well as the first Belgian style beer that I truely loved, enough to go out and buy another bottle of it almost right away.

There is really little of any funk that you might expect from a "farmhouse" style. Little spice, aside from what adds sweetness. I do get a little bite from the hops, but not enough to round this out to as rich a beer as it could be. The drinkability is high.

The taste is nice, a fine balance of hops and malts give this brew an uniquley understated spicey flavor. The pairs nicely with a turkey sandwich. This would be a nice beverage to have on hand to serve up with almost any meal, as it seems to pair nicely with most foods.

Nice spots of lacing left on the glass and the beer cleared up quite a bit as it warmed. The smell is very inviting. Malt , clove ,spice , fruit , grain , yeast , and a tinge of honey are all in the nose. Flavor is pleasant and complex. Some tartness in the form of grain and citric/lemon tastes , clove, bit of medicinal phenolic qualites , bready malt , tad bit of honey , slight peppery spice, a bit of banana and herbal notes , and a yeasty dryness in the end.

It all sounds nice, except the tartness was too strong. Resulted in an extremely unbalanced flavor. Not to say the beer was terrible, it wasn't, however it could use significantly more strength from the earthy/malty notes. Tartness and acidity need to be toned down a bit.

The beer was also mildly alcoholic and was somehow reminding me of lagerish scents. The taste was somewhat "farmhouse" sour.

Theres a mossy anis-like yeast that just grooves with my palate and a green grass undertone. Theres also an obscured foundation of sweet grains that taste like oats and wheat. Light airy bubbles seem to unlock a hint of mandarin oranges and a very subtle dry piney hops. The mouth feel was medium bodied with an unobtrusive carbonation. Absolutely amazing.

I have to say, this beer gets better as it slightly warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, going down far too easy for the higher ABV that it possesses. Drinkability is good.

Bottle doesn't look any different than the regular "non-cave-aged" stuff, except there's a hangtag proclaiming that it sat 156 feet underground, etc. and there's a bunch of fuzzy cobwebby stuff and dust on the outside of the bottle. Hazy golden orange with massive, beautiful egg-white head that meringues and leaves an incredible webby lacing all the way down the sides of my Ommegang cervoise. Aroma is yeasty, bitter citrus peel, fresh apple juice, vanilla. Spicy, earthy, and fruity flavors abound. A bit vinous at the back of the palate. Granny Smith apples and newly-mown grass. Mellow ginger spiciness, yeast, and a lingering aftertaste of peach cobbler with vanilla and powdered ginger. Medium body; creamy smooth and dry for so much pronounced fruit flavor. This is one of my all time favorite beers from an all time favorite brewery. Saisons are all pretty unique (at least the ones I've tried), so it's a bit risky to say which one is "the Best." However, Hennepin, whether cave-aged or not, is absolutely one of the finest examples of the style in the world and easily the best Saison produced in the U.S. Difficult to imagine anyone pulling it off better than this.

Taste is equally complex and challenging; at first the bready malt takes center stage, then onto the spices including but not limited to: nutmeg, lemon zest, corrainder, and pepper, and then a lightly bitter hops flavor that is earthy, mineraly and slightly citrusy. There is also a fruity yeast flavor that adds yet another layer of complexity to this fantastic brew.

It's a very decent beer fresh, and I appreciate that, but I like to put 6 to 12 months on it to drop the yeast and soften it a touch. So, that said, the cave age is no different from my cellared bottles except that there's dust and tiny chunks of rock (?) on the bottle. If you don't have a cellar that holds 55-65 F during summer, you might want to try one of these; but other than that, forget the extra expense and do it yourself. It's only a few buck put away for a little while (it doesn't really improve beyond conditioning, and I think it's quite nice and ready to go with even four months under its belt).

The flavor has a nice spice character and a definite hop presence. Very interesting mixture. Blends well for a crisp taste. Finish has a bit of sweetness.

Perfect clear (no yeast in the pour at first) peach color with a totally luscious looking cream colored head that won't go away and leaves plenty of lacing.

Orange and other citrus at the front, with plenty of spiciness to go around as the brew moves around my mouth. Dry finish. Very quenching and went suberbly with the Mexican food I had for dinner.

It starts out with some candied fruits or other sweet additives (presumably the hops), and leaves a satisfying citrus in your mouth after it is finished.

Looks amazing - 3 finger head that is so close to white and pokes out the top of the glass. It is rocky and sticky, leaving big clumps of foam for lace. The body is a hazy orange/amber with a buncha stuff floating around. Aroma is outdoorsy with grapes, white wine, lemons, some tropical fruits, and a big spiciness. It is sharp and spicy on the palate with yeast, lemons, wine, and is kinda dry. It has a very distinct taste that lingers and makes you want more.

Strong aroma involving fruits, bready pale malts, yeast, a little spice, and some citrous hops. Taste is bold and complex. Bready malt jumps out quickly, before bitter lemons and citrous rinds attack the tongue. Some caramel-like sweetness dances with spice, but there is an underlying creaminess. Mouthfeel is pretty full, but crisp carbonation and the zesty hops really blast inside the mouth.

Mouthfeel is amazing--thick and full bodied, it almost taste like your chewing bread. This is one hell of a beer.

Smell is yeasty, bready, zesty, spicy, and dusty. Unfortunately, it's not as dusty and funky in the taste. Not quite a true Belgian in that sense, but it is very good, don't get me wrong. I've recently become obsessed with the best Belgian pale ales, De Ranke XX and Orval specifically. I love that dry, hoppy, grassy taste. I've been searching for a cheaper alternative that is equally satisfying and refreshing, and this is a close one. The taste is nice and hoppy, decently bitter, and with a nice soft buttery malt taste. The dusty taste I like is noticable too, a definate plus. Really smooth mouthfeel and this beer is highly refreshing, which makes it highly quaffable. Really a good beer. Really. I don't know what it is, but there's something about those beers from Belgium that are just indescribable that can't be found elsewhere. This beer is not to be faulted though for not having that quality however. An awesome beer from Cooperstown.","twelvsies","Apr 07, 2005"

The suggested serving glass call for a wide-mouth glass, (I used a red wine glass) upon pouring a swelling of orange, berries and some serious alcohol infused my nostrils. This beer taste like a summer beer, overloaded with sweetly hops that balance each other. This beer almost transcends beer at its strangest and purest points.

Pours a pale golden color with a constant source of fizz. The HUGE billowy foam cap seems to grow even after the pour is done. Smells fantastic, very spicey, but otherwise difficult to place. Tastes spicey as well, with a hint of a hop bite in the end. Taste seems to morph as the drinker becomes acclimatized and the beer warms. Seems to have a buttery banana ester quality at some point that fades into a funky belgian yeasty clove flavor. I will definitely try other saisons.","neonbrown82","Mar 19, 2005"

This beer has a nice soft sweet grain character which mixes quite well with, and in fact even accentuates, the refreshing, cool citrus notes. This beer is very good, it is just about the perfect beer to sit down and enjoy over an evening. The one flaw is that it is perhaps a little to thick in the body, don't get me wrong, it is by no means thick, it is just that I like my farmhouse ales with a nice dry, light palate.

Somewhat tart and yeasty with nicely balanced hops. Some banana and clove notes as well. Finishes dry. Crisp and refreshing.

The nose has a yeasty/doughy character up front with bright grapefruit from the hops and a mild candy character from the malt. Very layered and complex. The taste has an awakening tartness followed by a mild bitterness. The play between the sweetness and tartness is very pronounced. Light and slick mouth feel leads to a very drinkable beer.

I'm also picking up banana-ish esters, pepper, candyish fruit malts, and yeast. Yum. Spicy, almost-bitter floral hops up front, that are accenuated with a lively carbonated spritzy feel. Rounds into a yeast-accented malt tang, with the bitterness remaining. Estery fruits and light candy sweetness swell into the finish, which is long, and strong with both sweet fruits/yeast and floral bitterness. Surprisingly full-bodied ale that has just the right amount of carbonation. One of the best US-made Belgian ales I've had.","alexgash","Feb 06, 2005"

The brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a thick frothy, foamy head that had incredible retention and left chunky lacing through out. The carbonation is very active with a good deal of small (reminds me of champagne) bubbles coursing up the side. This is a very inviting looking beer; something about it just says it looks perfect! The aromas have a pronounced Belgian scent to it from the yeast I would presume (?), very earthy. Scene highlights of pepper, grapes, citrus like hop qualities, and a sweet aroma. Very drinkable brew; somewhat sweet with a fruit (citrus) like taste ending with a balanced hop ness. This is a very nice brew, over all it is highly drinkable and very refreshing.","Stimack","Feb 03, 2005"

Crisp and light, mild fruit (pears and apples) with subtle spice, clean and smooth. Very nice carbonation as well... not overly carbonated, but just enough to be refreshing. No odd flavors, nothing to make you go "wow!" or "huh?", just an extremely well crafted beer that reminds you that great beer doesn't have to be anything extreme (not that there's anything wrong with extreme beers, and I enjoy my fair share, but Hennepin proves that simple and well-balanced doesn't have to mean boring).","apintofknowledge","Jan 30, 2005"

The taste was initially sweet, with some bitterness at the end. Exceptoinal taste, it was balanced almost prefectly with some grassy and citrus undertones.

The nose is full of fruit and malt, with a touch of sweetness reminiscent of good Belgian ales. The mouth is light and very, very prickly. Good smooth if not overpowering taste, with sweet fruit and spices up front, carried by a malt backbone.

A large white head rushes to fill the space in my tulip glass. The head recedes leaving a rocky terrain of foam with lacing down the sides of the glass. The first aroma is a wet musty closet...very interesting. There's some fruitiness in the background, but it is kept at bay by the musty funk. The taste is wet blanket (cliche, I know, but still true), with oranges and apples mushed in. As the beer sits on the tongue and sails into the finish, a pronounced hop bitterness appears. Finishes fairly dry and is very drinkable. This is a great tasting beer, one I will buy often. A great example of a Saison that hold up very well when compared to Saison Dupont (the flagship of the style IMO). At $4.99 for a 750 ml., it's really a no brainer!","Hagbard","Jan 11, 2005"

The carbonation is very good-not too much or little, with a finger size foam lace at the top of a goblet. The mouthfeel is good with very slowly disapating foam. Very easy to drink but has a little alcohol kick to it. You can feel it as you drink (7% ABV) but you really feel it as it hits your head. Some beers have a delayed alcohol reaction-not this one.

The cork was a bit tougher to get out then usual. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow shade, lots of tiny yeast particles floating around. Head was fairly active, but settled to a fine film, and leaves respectable, fine, long strands of lacing. Nose is at once Smokey,spicy, with pepper,cloves, and ginger picked up. This is a fine example of the style. Earthy, peppery, fruits,smoke,yeast. Hops cleansing the tongue and making it want more of this fine heady creation.

Initial flavors start off sweet and spicy with a champagne like mouthfeel from the firm carbonation. The flavors progress to a lemony like citrus flavor with yet more spice and a slight alcohol kick to it. The finish to this brew is just as spritzy as the beginning with an almost clove like finish.

The aroma is a grassy banana and the taste complements with rolling mellow flavors. In my opinion, the mouthfeel of the Hennepin makes the entire experience. The beer is perfectly carbonated and delivers the perfect balance of earthy flavors, yeast, and CO2 to make this a delightful treat that is at home in any season.","beerattorney","Dec 19, 2004"

4.67,12.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The cork was very hard to get out, but when it went it went with an audible pop. It pours a golden orange with a huge white head that fades to a 0.5cm coating on the top of the beer. The aroma is floral, spicy (coriander and clove) with strong hints of orange peel. Taste is spicy, slightly sour, hoppy and pergaps a bit of clover honey. Slightly slick mouthfeel, with a warming alcohol finish. Extremely smooth and drinkable, and seems to have mellowed with its time in the cave and the cellar. A great celebratory drink and if you can find the 2001 edition, you'll be happy you did.","ColForbin","Dec 09, 2004"

When poured in my trusty goblet, the beer looked marvelous with clear, pale golden body, and an outrageously sized head that tried my patience as I could only get half of the bottle into the 16 oz. glass. As the head died down, there was tons of lace left behind. The smell was delicately floral, spicy, earthy, and fruity, with bananas, saffron, pepper, and horse blanket evident. The taste was tart and sweet, with flavors of lemon, banana, beet sugar, orange peel, and radishes. The aftertaste was spicy and semi-dry, and left me longing for more. Thin and delicate mouthfeel is a bit dusty. This beer has very good drinkability and offers a good value for the money. I will be sampling more beers from them again.","rajendra82","Nov 25, 2004"

Lazy cling, o.k. lacing. Beer is peach chrome in color with honey-colored highlights and enough yeast haze to make the carbonation just barely visible. Smells involve peach pie filling, cinnamon sugar cookies, beeswax and clover. A twist of saffron and the perfume of shredded violets round out a cool, floral, humid nosefeel. Fresh ginger flavors dominate over the sweetness of ladyfingers in the front palate. Must, straw, and alcohol are incorporated into perfectly level transitions between fruit and spice before ending with a well-hopped, bitter finish of fruit pits that sticks the tongue to the roof of the mouth. Burps of red delicious apple appear by the time I'm reaching for my second bottle. Mouthfeel is lightly viscous with a calciferous, magazine-paper slickness and a sharp, tingling POW! of carbonation high on the tongue.

Honey sweet malt notes, some red licorice candy-like sweetness with a citrusy, peppery, and botanical (heather and lemongrass) nose. Initially sweet and floral, like an orange blossom, and then moving towards a more bitter, hoppy finish while still maintaining a general sweetness, overall. Good carbonation. Very complex, in aroma and taste.

This beer is just fizz on the tongue and then leaves a little flavor there that is esters and spice. Not as much ginger as I remember.

Earthy doughy aroma with a bit of mild coriander and light lemon. Nice light fluffy mouthfeel on a lighter bodied beer. I don't know if it's the second glass of Hennepin but I'm noticing the warm stomach effect. A bit more flavor in this one, pale malt (or strong wheat beer) not noticing the spices or lemon, just slightly more bitter.

The singature fruity aromas were even more complex, in this sample, and the spicy/herbal hops were definately much more pronounced as well. This brew has a nice bready middle, and an everlasting spicy hop finish. The flavors melded together very well, making for an exceptionally smooth drink, that drained from my glass too quickly.

Quite fruity overall with grapes, lemon/citrus, but it could use a bit more spices to my liking. Saison-ish hay character is very well defined though and appealing. Lots of warming alcohol in mouth also, a solid hay field accompany typical cereals. Mildly acid with more lemon, yeasty with a dry bitter finish. The body is highly carbonated, a bit too much for my tastes with this particular flavor profile, it's smooth and big enough to support the warming effect nevertheless. I must say I expected more from one of the rare american Saison, the obvious alcohol at this moderately low ABV just doesn't allow for the quaffable yet feeding beverage I expect.","Rastacouere","Apr 19, 2004"

One of the first Belgians I have had, so the taste was definitely a mystery when the first drop hit my lips. Smooth taste with a sweet aftertaste that is in no way dissatisfying. When I let my girlfriend try it, she thought she was drinking a champagne or sparkling wine. The carbonation is odd, but somewhat refreshing.

3.77,-9.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"I admit that I am not all that familiar with this style though I have enjoyed Brewery Ommegang's several other worthy offerings. This pours a clear light golden color (I got the first pour out of the large bottle--the later pours got a bit of the typical cloudiness of a bottle fermented brew). There is a large white head, and the effervescence is evident right from the outset. The head receded slowly, and the lacing is tenacious but not sticky. The aroma is tart, dominated by citrus and ginger with an underlying wheat maltiness. The taste, I'm afraid, was initially a bit too rubbery for my palate, letting the alcohol reign for a moment or two, but as it moved to a finish the aforementioned aromas insinuated nicely themselves into the mix. The mouthfeel is thin to medium with lots of carbonation.","longpondbeerman","Mar 10, 2004"
4.4,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Ive had this beer several times and I finally found out that I havent reviewed it yet, so here goes. The beer pours with huge frothy head, which seems to have a certain rigidity to itself, retaining a tall lofty shape in the middle, even as it dies down around the sides. The lace patches up nicely along the glass. Bubbles float aimlessly from the bottom. The smell is wonderful, with immediately recognizable hints of the heavy wheatiness of the beer, a ton of spices, a hint of lemon and an overall yeasiness that makes me think of bread dough. There is bit of hoppiness evident, and touch of straight alcohol is also present. For lack of a better term, it smells very thick in the nose. The taste follows right along with the smell. It is very warming and thick, with the wheatiness of a weisse beer, showing a strong yeast character again, with the alcohol definatley tastable. The exact characteristics of the spiciness escape me, but its a heavy part of the taste. Mouthfeel is a light syrupy viscosity, with tons of tiny carbonation filling the mouth. Drinking this gives me a nice warm feeling. A nice throw back to the past, as this was one of the first "real" beers I ever had.","FranklinPCombs","Mar 10, 2004"
4.2,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Hennepin was served from a 12. oz bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was murky and straw colored, with a fine head that left fascinating tendrils of lacing. Very attractive. The nose was quite wonderful, with a zippy lemony acidity garnished with coriander, a rough orangy mustiness, and a touch of sweetness. The taste began with a lemony citric tinged sweetish malt base that developed accents of mandarin orange. The beer finished amazingly with an energetic smack of bitterness followed by ever lingering lemon-lime-orange notes...I loved this. However, I felt that the beer was a bit too sweet and not crisp/dry enough for a saison. For this reason I had to deduct a half-point, but I must stress that this was the only negative. The beer had the appropriate vigorous carbonation, and the body was full and smooth.","HiroProtagonist","Mar 08, 2004"

The aroma is reminiscent of honey, citrus, and that smell I refer to as "earthy" (kind of like smelling tree roots). The taste is nice, though a bit "wheaty" for me. I can definitely taste the wheat character in the beer. One of the only detractions is a hint of the alcohol comes through, (at 7.5 percent), so it detracts some from the flavor.

More ginger, orange rind, Saaz hops, ripe apple and pear are evident before a mild finish reminiscent of freshly ground pepper. Mouthfeel is smooth, lush and downright pleasing. Drinkability is phenomenal for a beer of 7.5% abv. Though it's not a true saison to the traditionalist due to its alcohol content, it's a damn good beer that is clearly worthy of your attention.

This beer makes no apology and produces a very bold flavor. The finish is stong with belgian malt and a hint of alcohol. Worth the 3.99 price tag, to be as understating as possible.

Nice crisp, somewhat fruity taste that cleansed the palate quite nicely with a subtle aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, which was good for the alcohol content...no extreme bite here.

The taste is not neraly as sweet as the aroma insinuates. It has a nice grassy hop component, atop decent malt that just seems to stay out of the way. The finish is slightly bitter, but has a strange complexity. The spices bring to mind homemade chicken soup, as they did on the nose (I just thought it odd to mention at the time.) It has a very dry finish, that is slightly smoky or something. I can almost guarantee this would go well with roasted chicken or turkey. The mouthfeel is light and airy, but doesn't leave me feeling like something is missing. The drinkability is very good. I think this is an ideal dinner drink for poultry, and less of an everyday drinker. This may find it's way to my Thanksgiving table.

4.35,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Cool bottle, which is always nice, seems to make my tongue more anxious. It pours nicely, an slight orange hue to the golden yellow brew as the cascade of bubbles make their way to the top for their obligatory contribution to a nice sized head. I smell bananas, clove, ginger, some other fruits, and yeastiness. And boy it is a nice tasting ale, with the fruitiness (banana and grapefruit) and spices making a nice balance with a decent hop presence. I found it to be a smooth beer with the carbonation action livening up my tongue, by the alcohol content makes this one to be careful with since I really couldn't tell it was that high.","BigHead","Jun 20, 2003"
4.65,12,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Served from a corked 750 ml bottle it appears a golden hue with a vibrant white head leaving trickled lace a picture perfect Belgium style ale. Aroma has some of those farm house ale characteristics of spices and yeast notes very nice along with huge tones of malt sweetness, underlying honey notes and the phenols are also producing the fruit tones characteristic of any fine Belgium ale. So, far simply amazing I love it. Taste light trickled malt, this is the perfect combination of sweetness, light hops, and exotic spices and full rich tones with a nice finish of alcohol on the palate. The mouthfeel has the consistency of a light syrup highly carbonated just full enough to coat the palate and tickle the senses. Drinkability is just wow, I could treat this like a session beer until I tried to stand up. Really too drinkable and desireable to approach too often save it as a treat. Best thing about it is the reasonable price for such a great beer, classic!","WVbeergeek","Jun 14, 2003"

4.18,0.7,5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a light gold color with a lovely white head that stands tall. The aroma is exceptional. I love belgian beers like this one. There is so much going on in here; bitter orange peels, corriander, etc. It has a sort of banana aroma. I can't say enough about it. The taste is also good. It rings of spices right from the first sip. The elevated alcohol level (7.5%) also lets you know that this is a beer to enjoyed, not slammed down. This would be great with some gourmet food. The mouthfeel is tremendously smooth for a bottle conditioned ale. It goes down smooth and is very drinkable. A great choice anytime. In my opinion, their best regular offering, only edged out by their limited edition Three Philosophers.","WesWes","Jun 11, 2003"

Forget lacing on the glass, this one left big clumps and gobs behind. Truly amazing head, bigger and fluffier than anything else I've tried. (I looked in the bottle for a nitro widget, none there...) The head was obviously inspired by the beer's namesake, Fr. Hennepin, who was the first European to see Niagara Falls. The aromas were abundant, malt, clove, leather and tobacco. The taste was mostly malt and clove, that faded to grapefruit. Faint notes of honey, caramel, and pine. The mouthfeel was creamy, and had (truly amazing, considering the massive head) light carbonation. The finish was very mellow, setting me gently down to earth with a smooth, mild hoppiness. Wow!

I broke my regular glass and was forced to drink from a green glass so I can't comment on the color or clarity (guess I need to get some more). The aroma was fruity and hoppy, maybe a bit spicy. Taste was great, ranging from sweet, to tart, to a bitterness that seemed to grow stronger with each glass. Nice lacing, and the head persisted to the bitter end, of course it didn't take long to polish off this beer. While there are better Belgians out there I must say this is a steal at $4-5 for 750ml...at that price its worth it just for shooting the cork at your friends.","Sixpack595","May 20, 2003"

3.91,-5.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Definately one of the better Saison style brews I've had, especially considering it is made in the United States. Hennepin's strongest characteristics begin to present themselves as the beer airs out and warms up a bit from its bottly confines. At first I found the bouquet to be a bit on the sour side and thought that I may have bought a skunked bottle of Hennepin, but after a few minutes I began to discover its delecate honey and hops tones. Definately a sipping beer, probably good on a hot day (I had it indoors on a 35 degree day). Overall, another excellent BC offering from Cooperstown.","ChrisBowers","Apr 11, 2003"

Hazy golden in appearance. Smell is wonderful - lemon and bubble gum? First sip reveals grassy, earthy flavor and on the dry side. I got a nice aftertaste that seemed honey like in sweetness with some sourness. I read a review after my initial notes that indicated a salty cheese flavor that I agree with.

The smell was sweet like candied fruit with some rounded maltiness. The taste was crisp, smooth a very dry with some incredible carmamel flavors and notes of slight grape as well. I cannot praise this highly enough. I can see why they call this a folk beer. I would definitely drink 4-5 of these on a hot day which is exactly what this day was.

Carbonation is moderately strong. Aroma is highly yeasty with lots of phenolic cloves and banana. Hops and malts are barely discernable. No funk, esters, diacetyl or other fermentation by-products noted. Mouthfeel is fizzy and spritzy with a light body. Retention and lacing are adequate. A simple, but relatively clean beer....cloves, bananas, autolyzed yeast, wheat spiciness, some well-hidden (in taste) alcohol, with an isopropyl-like dry citrus finish and watery mouthfeel. As it warms, a grainy pale-malt note comes out in the finish and as the carbonation dissipates, the mouthfeel improves. There is still that metallic, ruddy tang (bad water?) that I tasted in the Ommegang, but thankfully this doesn't taste like ass. Adding the yeast and letting it warm made it infinitely more drinkable. Somewhat inferior, but similar to Blanche de Chambly from Unibroue but with a more potent alcohol bite. A 750ml bottle gave me a pleasant buzz.","Mitchster","Mar 10, 2003"

However, its been tough to resist the temptation to open it before tonight on many occasions! Pours a bright hazy golden color with a monstrous pillowy white head that billows out of the glass and very slowly fades into a heavy lace and coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of lace as it recedes. Active carbonation is apparent as you can see many streams of tiny bubbles racing up the glass. Nose is sweet honey and fresh citrus with some floral notes. Similar to regular Hennepin but a bit softer. Medium in body with one of the smoothest mouthfeels Ive ever known a beer to have. The active carbonation also gives the beer a very crisp quality. Taste is very complex. Sweet and fruity at first with flavors of banana, grapefruit, melon, lemon, and honey followed (and nicely balanced) by a dry yeastiness and maltiness. Ive often been reminded of fine champagne while sipping a regular Hennepin, and this one is no different. It does have a more mellow yeasty and citrusy bite to it then regular Hennepin, though. This was simply a magnificent beer. Absolutely one of the best beers Ive ever had the pleasure to drink. A very special thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!","Morris729","Feb 24, 2003"

Wheat and lemonish flavors arive and depart. Clove and yeast knock on the door aswell. This is a beer that anyone can enjoy. Not too hoppy to scare away the unworthys (to quote Stone) and complex enough to satisfy a wine-buff.

Fluffy lace remains. Similar to Orval in the body and mouthfeel, but without the spicy, flowery taste. This goes down so easy, it could get you in trouble! Dare I say delicate?!

There's also a lot of sour fruitiness going on. Grapefruit especially. More delicate malt is detectable, which is a little bready. Even with the hop bitterness, this is very smooth. Great mouthfeel. Sourness and malt in the finish. Great beer! This could be considered a warm weather refresher, but I'm enjoying it on a cool evening, and it's working great.

I was expecting more depth and complexity to this brew, but it held back until the finish. It mellowed to a nice balance at the end and the tartness faded to sweet.

Flavors include lemon, white grapes, almonds, apples (yellow or green), spices and pepper, with a quite sour finish. Malts are incredibly delicate and hops only underscore the spices of the big yeast profile. A saison perhaps, but I found this merging into Duvel / pale / tripel territory due to its brightness and zesty lemon flavors, and almost none of the tea or peach flavors that I associate with a saison. I imagine a good meal would bring out the heartier aspects of this brew. As such it remains an excellent US version of a Belgian and surprisingly cooling and refreshing.","Thrasher","Jan 08, 2003"

Hop flavor or bitterness wasnt too prevalent, however there was some pepperiness to the beer. Carbonation was bigger than Id like and the beer was more viscous than any Saison Ive come across.

The first thing you notice is the fruity yeast followed by grains of paradise, orange, lemon, coriander, and hints of alcohol. The taste is very well balanced with the malt flavors up front. This is followed by citrus flavors and spice flavors blending in with the malt and being balanced with the effervescence of this well carbonated ale. The finish is dry with notes of apple and pear and just a hint of hops balanced against the alcohol. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness with citrus and alcohol notes.

I am sure that they will enjoy it and if you have yet to taste this great beer, you will probably enjoy it too.","MaineBeerMan","Oct 26, 2002"
4.63,11.6,4.5,4,5,4,5,"To put it simple Ommegang is one hell of a brewery!  This nectar pours a cloudy golden color with a slight head and good lace along the glass.  The scent is somewhat of a fruity one but not overly sweet like some Belgians.  The taste is perfectly balanced more toward the malty side IMO.  And it sits well on the palate, this beer is very drinkable for anyone. I think this is the one i would choose for the uneducated beer drinker to start with, it won't scare them off, and we BA can enjoy it also.  I didn't think they could beat Ommegan but I think I loke this one better.  I look forward to trying the other beers from this brewery when I can get my hands on them........CHEERS","tigerpaws","Oct 18, 2002"
4.85,16.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Cloudy golden yellow with a foamy head that pours with the deadly ability to climb with vigor right out of your glass and onto the table. (which happened to me)  The bouquet reveals musty fruit with a bit of spice and a slight alcohol presence.  The taste is strong at first with a bit of the alcohol up front and a yeasty spiciness which rounds out to reveal a strong fruit presence and some slight hop bitterness that surfaces towards the end.  Intense fruit flavors ride out throuh the very long and smooth finish enticing another swill.  Well structured with good complexity, very well balanced, and dangerously drinkable.","jmatthew","Oct 14, 2002"
5,20.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Very complex body, very complex beer. At times fuller and chunky, at other times lighter and somewhat sweet. To call it excellent is an understatement. One of the best beers I have ever had.","Mick","Oct 07, 2002"
3.98,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Nice and warm.  This beer is well balanced--the strong malt flavor blends well with the bitterness and subtle hop flavor.  Has a slight spicy/phenolic character, but not overwhelming.  Alcohol is nocibaly present at first, but fades.  Very complex, but no particular aspect dominates.  Thany you sir...may I have another.","whit","Sep 16, 2002"
4.22,1.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Initially a shiny clear yellow color, bottle swirl produces the famialer cloudy yellow. Highly charged, bubbly white head, faded fast, but left a small film of lace. Smelled everything from honey, citrus, pepper, and spices. Taste was deeply inticing, new tastes on every sip. Sweet, crisp tart citrus and honey to start. As the beer warmed, more subtle peppery tastes emerge, then noticable alcohol warming takes place. Noticable abv warms you as you drink, every sip is a new taste combination. Good beer to finish the evening. I'm very Impressed this one, and will seek it out again.","StevieW","Sep 16, 2002"

4.77,14.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a hazy golden color with a decent creamy white head that never fully sinks and leaves a decent lace down the glass.  Huge bubblegum, banana and other lighter fruits, and spicy pepper dominate the smell.  The taste starts off with some great light fruity flavors that is mostly dominated by banana with some possible peach and orange.  About half way through the brew gets nicely spicy with some good peppery qualities to it.  Excellently creamy and smooth but also fairly refreshing and excelently drinkable with a medium body to it.  This is one damn fine brew and I can't wait to get my hands on some more.","Murph","Aug 14, 2002"
4.58,10.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Coudy golden-orange, with billowy pure white head that sticks around for the long haul. Beautiful. Spicy banana aromas, very complex. Taste is herbal hops, pepper, clove, banana, candied ginger, caramelized orange rind, pear -- it's all in there! High carbonation creates a playful feeling on the tongue, and balances nicely with the spicy and oh-so-bitter finish. This is a damn good beer.","mophie","Aug 09, 2002"

4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This brew is a chill hazed golden and throws out a big pufffy white head that has nice retention.  Pretty sweet aroma with this one.  Honey like.  Almost like a braggot or that Midas Touch brew.  There's also some fruity esters perceived on the nose.  Maybe some slight herbalness too.  Nice aroma.  Now this is a style of Belgian beers I can get into.  This is really nice tasting.  It is sweet, but kept in check with the hops, herbs and spices (which I will only try to take a stab at).  There could be something like Rosemary or Marjoram throwing some pizzaz into this brew.  I like it whatever it is.  This brew really has a nice earthiness to it.  Very unique taste.  But very drinkable.  Honey also seems to be perceived on the tongue.  This is a light-medium bodied brew.  Very good.","Bighuge","Jul 24, 2002"
4.4,6,4,4,4.5,4,5,"The fluffy, thick lace - leaving porcelin - white head tops a hazy light tangerine hued effervescent brew.  Orange zest, candied ginger w/ trace phenol in aroma.  Tart, citrus rind hit the palette upfront and are followed by a mild but refreshing hop bitterness.  A light sweetness persists throughout this brew and seems to be the foundation for other flavors to build upon.  Candied fruit, honey, pear notes all intermingle in a whimiscal fashion.  The light body and crisp mouthfeel add to the flavorful yet refreshing nature of this brew.  Finishes bittersweet, w/ a mellow lingering breadiness.  Hennepin is "playful" in flavor, yet is very clean, and its drinkability is superlative.  Alcohol warmth surfaces long after the sip finishes.  Excellent, and perhaps bit dangerous.","marc77","Jun 24, 2002"
4.48,8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Fresh fruit aroma with hints of sweetness.  There is also strong yeast odor.  Very pale hazy look with a thick white head.  I also smell bannana.  Very carbonated at first taste with bannana and hops on the tongue.  Great mouth very sharp tasting also on the tongue.  lots of complexity in the yeast/hops relationship.  This would make a great starter with cheese and fruit.  Awesome American ... as usual from Brewery Ommegang!","frank4sail","Jun 21, 2002"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Orangey and opaque, 1/4 inch fine mist head replenished by ascending carbonation. Bubbles shimmer like sugar crystals on the side of the glass. Slightly astringent aroma. Good combination of fruit, a little banana, and very nice bittering at the end.  Pretty reserved and yet nice tasting.  Its hard to call a Belgian a  "session" brew to me, but this one would be for me.  Solid in most categories.","ADR","Jun 20, 2002"
4.1,-1.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured out a nice golden color.  It formed a nice white head with some lace on the side later on.  The aroma of smelled of malts and cirtus.  Good level of carbination to this beer.  Due to that, the initial mouthfeel taste of it throws me off a little, but it sudsides after the next taste or so.  Hides it's alcohol content well.  A very enjoyable beer.","Wildman","Jun 11, 2002"
4.23,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"It all starts when you pop the cork from the bottle.  A nice loud 'pop' - almost like a champagne.  The beer pours to a hazy gold, with a thick, white head.  Solid head retention, with lace clinging to the glass as you drink.  Smell is lightly fruity and spicy, filled with sweet apple, pepper, hops, and yeast.  Flavor is rich and strong with the flavors hinted at in the aroma.  I also notice a bit of citrus flavor meshing with the apple.  Lively continual carbonation give the brew a bit of zest, but not too much as to make it seem acidic on the tongue.  Wonderful brew, and a great cost effective Belgian-style ale.","Viking","Jun 10, 2002"
4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden with lively carbonation. A long-lived head displays ample Belgian lace clinging to the glass. Nose is light malt, and a wee bit lemony. Taste is again light, fruity with some hoppy bitterness coming thru. Close your eyes and you'll swear this beer was brewed in Belgium. Goes great with Wise BBQ potato chips.","beerluvr","Jun 01, 2002"
4.1,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Update: Maybe my opinion of Ommy has soured, but this is not the beer I once thought, aged or fresh. More tart than memory recalls with green apples and citric fruit taking the fore. Simplistic, light peppery and doughbal yeastiness. Good for what it is, but so many saisons surpass this. But I must say, for the price, this is still a soild belgo-quaffer.","cokes","May 29, 2002"

4.05,-2.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Cloudy and golden with lovely white head that sticks around. Very smooth and full bodied initially, followed by a bitter/alcohol/carbonation gang-bang bite at the back of the palate and into the nose coupled with a lingering bitterness with a slight tartness that leaves the outsides of your tongue somewhat numb. Taste is very similar to biere de garde style with lots of spiciness but not much wineniness.","jermar","Mar 07, 2002"
