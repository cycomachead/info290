Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, grape, ginger, grains of paradise, orange zest, clove, pepper, herbal, honey, light funk, and earthy yeast esters. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of spices and yeast esters with moderate malt presence. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, grape, grains of paradise, ginger, clove, pepper, orange peel, honey, bread, light funk, and earthy yeast esters. Lingering notes of light fruits, ginger, grains of paradise, clove, pepper, honey, orange peel, and earthy yeast esters on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of spices and yeast esters; with moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, lightly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent saison! All around great balance and complexity of spices and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 22, 2013"

Perfectly dry and tart for a saison. really nice brew, but my only complaint is the price. Its deff well crafted, but I think it was around $15+.

The smell alone is refreshing; tingly orange peel forefront with yeast and spice bitterness. A very earthy aroma that is very relaxing to enjoy. Taste has more of the yeast and spices used- but very balanced out with slight citrus sweetness of the orange peel. Feels great to drink- nicely carbonated and light in the mouth while the head foam finds its spot on the roof. The only other Saison I've ever had is Saison du Buff- the Stone collaboration. I really like that one but if I had to choose one to drink regularly it would definitely be Red Barn.","tilopud_rye","0"

Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a four finger pure white head that continued to grow throughout the glass. Yes, that’s right, GROW! It maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, spices, fruit, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, fruit, earth hop, spices, and subtle banana. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The look of this brew was what I would want ALL of my Saisons to look! Not much can be improved on that. The flavor however left me a little to want though. The aftertaste just hit you in the face with dirt if I am completely honest. It wasn’t bad, but definitely not ideal. Still a great beer to try if you have not done so before.","thagr81us","Feb 04, 2012"

This is one of two Saisons that went the super spicy route, the other being Orchard White by The Bruery and that had too much lavender for my liking.

Smell is grassy like with a hint of apple and some type of Belgian yeast imparting a light bisquit vibe. Small hits of citrus is very hard to sense, but it is there. Sweet malt, brown and the like. Pretty bold in scent off the tap at least. Taste is a saison with a hint of beire de garde flavor, kinda a mix of the two. Grassy, floral, apple over pear. Slight bisquit from the malt leaving for a well balanced saison, yet nothing out of the ordinary. As a saison, this hits the marks though, except the yeast is a bit lighter than Belgian types making this more in line with American styles. Feel is a step above, well lets say it's approaching medium, carbed up nice off the tap with a crisp finish and slightly dry.

It pours a murky beautiful golden yellow with a three finger foamy, poofy bright white head. I'd say it's a golden honey in color. The foam takes a little while to calm down. It has multifaceted aromas. Depending on the whiff you take you'll get some yeast, bread, light pale malt sweetness, spice, citrus, or even a touch of sour. The flavor is very dry, spicy, with a light citrus finish on the verge of being bitter. It's tasty and different. It's a little light on the palate and leaves a slightly bitter citrus like after taste behind. It's solid and worth a try.","aasher","Mar 19, 2011"

The beer has a crisp finish, with the slightest little kiss of hops. There is a nice, smooth finish despite the peppery tones.

3.8,-3.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Red Barn ranges in color from burnt goldenrod (ambient lighting) to bright lemon yellow (fully backlit), and has some, but not total clarity. The first pour yielded about three fingers of head, with so-so retention and no detectable lacing. The second pour though yielded a full extra finger's worth of pure white foam, and retention and lacing are markedly improved. I'll chalk the first pour up to maybe a slightly dirty glass and take most of my impressions from the second pour. Orange and citrus dominate the nose, though the grains of paradise and black pepper are certainly present. I can't really find any ginger though, and ditto that for any malty flavors. There's just the briefest flash of green apple sweetness, and a mere suggestion of bitterness from restrained hopping. Otherwise, this beer is a blank canvas for the yeast and spices to work their magic. Again the orange is the standout flavor, with solid support from black pepper and grains of paradise. I'm used to my saisons being fairly spicy, so Red Barn featuring citrus more than black pepper/clove is a welcome change. I'm a little disappointed that I still can't find any ginger though. A top of the line saison has a truly transcendent mouthfeel, and in this regard Red Barn falls a bit short. Even for what's supposed to be a dry beer it's a bit too thin, crossing the line into watery. At the same time the carbonation is a bit too enthusiastic. Thin and fizzy is not a good body/carbonation combo. That dings the drinkability, but just a little bit. Red Barn is a fine beer, with the prominent orange peel being an interesting twist for the style. Still, I view this as an occasional change of pace beer from some other saisons I'd probably opt for more regularly.","axeman9182","Beers"

Poured into a tulip hazy golden with a decent rocky white head, shrinks over time forming a ring with pretty good lacing. The smell is pretty grassy, wheat with a bit of light fruit. Fruit and tartness come out moreso in the taste. Green apple, lemon, grass, wheat, a tiny bit of cherry-like tartness, some booze taste too. A very little bit of funk and not very sour at all, I'd give it maybe a 3/10 on the sour scale. Mouthfeel was quite good considering the style, but kept it at a 4 just because of a seemingly high alcohol taste for a 6.7%. I'd try it again.","Chico1985","Apr 07, 2010"

The taste is delicious as well. Smooth, refreshing, and certifiably funky. Absolutely drinkable, could sip on this one all day. Especially during the hot Central Valley summer we've got coming up in Northern California. Lost Abbey has done this Belgian classic better than most Belgians. This is at or above the efforts of DuPont, and in IMO, well above Hennepin or any American Saisons. Overall, a fantastic effort on the part of Port/Lost Abbey.","IrieJackalope","Mar 16, 2010"

Starts with a little citric sweetness, and finishes quite dry, with alcohol stripping the tongue along with a light citric astringency. Spicy pepper lingers in the back of your mouth. Medium-light body with smooth but tenacious carbonation. The dryness and spice makes it quite refreshing, but there is a tad too much pepper in the finish.

And there is something unexpected, a mintiness that persists to aftertaste. Some wheat there too, and acidic citrus tang, and maybe some peach hiding out in the distant background.

4.33,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bottle purchased at Ledgers in Berkeley for $7.99. Pours a very nice darker golden with just the tiniest wisp of haze, a very nice head that sticks around, and some excellent lacing. Slightly sweet and somewhat tangy in the aroma, as well as a hint of spice. This smells more like a tripel than a saison, with that hint of sweetness, touch of clove, and bit of yeasty tanginess. The taste has some of those same tripel elements, but the tanginess is a bit restrained and it tastes a bit cleaner, more like a saison, and there is a fairly large hit of white pepper and lighter touch of bitter orange peel right up front. The orange builds a good bit through the taste, as does the pepper, until the finish, which has a bit more rounded yeastiness. Fairly complex, and ultimately to me it comes off as an intriguing blend of tripel and saison with a bit more aggressive spicing than most. Very nice and relatively complex summertime fare. Smooth, spicy, and relatively addictive","Georgiabeer","Jul 21, 2008"

The beer pours almost exactly like Duvel does into this glass on its bottle, sporting a huge frothy three finger head, I had to wait a bit to try this one, the head lasted throughout as a one finger layer and left decent lacing. Aroma is loads of sweetness and spice, great malt presence, sweet fruits and slight funkiness. The taste is dominated by spice and sweet malts, crisp hops provide a nice spiciness, slight banana and lemon are present as well. The beer is light and crisp with a nice bite of carbonation that provides an easy drinking smoothness. This is certainly one of the best American brewed Farmhouse Ales I've had the pleasure of drinking. I have to say, so far, all the hype I've heard about Port Brewing seems truly justified.","atsprings","Jul 07, 2008"

Head eventually settles into a light slick of foam and bubbles with a solid band evident around the shoulders of the glass. Some loose sheets of lacing evident during the tasting. Spicy nose, as well as the presence of citrus, tart fruit (green apples) and candi sugar. Taste consistent with nose with a slight pucker at the finish. Yeast and clove also expressed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with lots of effervescence tingling throughout the mouth. Good drinkability, but a little on the sweet side for the style in my opinion. A nice offering nonetheless.","Jwale73","Jul 03, 2008"

Moderate bitterness, balanced nicely with significant fruitiness, malty base and bready, yeasty middle. It finished with a bit of pepper, then grassy, floral hop bitterness lingered.

Nose is all about a bunch of fresh fruits, some light pepper and Belgian yeasty goodness. Full flavor brew, more fruityness, melon, pears, apples, spice pepper, coriander, honey, bananas, complex and interesting stuff. Lovely final pour, loaded with sediment and nutty yeast.

Into the mouth, an immediate blast of rising bright fruitiness, meeting headstrong with a mouthful of malt and mild middle eastern spicings. A seemingly classic Saison build, with gentle sweeping malt sugars, high bright and freshening yeast character melding into a pile of nose bristling spice dust. Hops round out the back with a palate closing grassy complexity. If any faults fall upon this beer its that the spices seem a little muddled and artificial, but I think the yeast help cover it. Palate is perfection with a nice light airy body to carry all of the heavenly scents and flavors, through good malt configuration. Delicious.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 13, 2007"

3.35,-15,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My first from Lost Abbey. Pours an almost too clear gold with a surprisingly short lived head. Whas up with that? Nice smells of very light citrus and pepper. Not much funk. Or more precisely, none. Taste is dominated by that peppery spiciness, and only the slightness sense of sweetness. Mouthfeels seems thin, and even at this low alcohol, that does make an appearance. A buddy I shared this with remarked that this does not seem done. Definately not a favorite in the Saison category for me. This almost seems a higher spiced and alcoholic Witte.","Onibubba","Feb 08, 2007"
4.1,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Orangey amber, topped with a thick puff of white head. Good clarity. The head settles down quickly, diminishing further into a weak collar. Not uncommon with belgian styles. The color is quite attractive, with a soft glow about it. Very spicy aroma, the yeast apparently putting in double shifts to make this thing happen. Peppery and zesty, with a creamy malt underlayer. Some woodsy notes, maybe from hops, but it's hard to tell. Soft peachy fruit, and a bit of clovey spice/phenols. The flavor opens up with a light and bouyant texture, the carbonation tingling with fine bubbles dancing wildly. Initially mild and sweet, kinda dingy in that belgian malt way, just toasty sweetness with a bit of peachy pear fruit, then the finish rides in slightly before its cue, parading about with amusingly garish spiciness. Very peppery and clovey, achieving something akin to a winter warmer in a ginger-root/cinnamon kinda way. I wonder if this is spiced, and with what? Coriander? Kinda witbier-ish too. Strange brew. Adequate sweetness, the balance mostly served through the yeast character, with little discernable hoppage aside from a vague, flowery tint. Ends off slightly dry, with enough residual sugar to keep this just to the side of sweet. Pleasing and enjoyable, if maybe a bit heavy handed with the spiciness. It's like a saison running on jet fuel.","UnionMade","Feb 01, 2007"
4.07,3.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Sampled at the Monk's Cafe Lost Abbey beer dinner a few nights ago. The beer poured a cloudy orange color with a thick, fluffy white head. The nose of the beer is citrusy (lemon, orange) and has some spice nuances also. The taste is a bit earthy and also has nice touches of the citrus and spice, maybe some corriander. This beer is very smooth and refreshing and makes for a very drinkable beer.","ggaughan","Jan 27, 2007"

4.03,2.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste: Solid, solid body that hits you right from the start, only to give way to the spicy, bready yeast flavors in the middle, and cuts dry with a resinous hop finale. Carbonation is just the way I like it, vivid and tingly. I'm a sucker for Saisons, this one hit all the right buttons for me.","Goldorak","Jan 14, 2007"
3.65,-7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Received in a trade from BA Dogfoodog, this Lost Abbey brown bomber was caged, corked, and had a painting of a red barn basking in a sunny summer day. The beer came out peach colored, and very cloudy, and the head atop it was craggy and durable. The smell was light and floral, and not a lot of spices were detected in the nose. Typical of the American versions of the style, earthy yeastiness was mostly absent as well. Taste was sweeter than most authentic Belgian Saisons, with floral and herbal flavors from the added ingredients attempting to balance things out. Delicious overall, but had they used a strain of yeast that ate up more of the residual sugars and dried the flavor up more, this would have been a lot more refreshing. I am thinking this beer is more of appropriate for fall than summer. Thicker than anticipated mouthfeel and carbonation was medium at best. A very charming, but off the style Saison.","rajendra82","Jan 05, 2007"

3.65,-7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2" beige head over the almost clear golden amber brew. Head falls gradually, with average lacing. Aroma is spicy, with fruity tartness tickling the nose as well. Taste follows the nose pretty well, spicy malt sweetness upfront, with a bit of fruit, and then some tartness enters and carries on through the aftertaste. Kind of muddied a bit for me. Mouthfeel is ok, a bit prickly though, and drinkability goes along in the same vein. Not quite all I expected here, but still a solid and interesting offering.","ppoitras","Dec 11, 2006"

3.67,-6.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: While I like a light saison to ring in the hotter seasons this seems more suited as a nightcapper. Not a knock in the slightest but just for my notes I would enjoy this more off season.","DogFood11","Nov 14, 2006"
3.58,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The taste has much of the same flavor with some fruity apple notes. It's fairly sweet and tangy overall. Light and foamy mouthfeel, with forceful carbonation. The drinkability is decent, I was expecting a more impressive Saison, however, considering the price ($9~) and Port Brewing's reputation. I would have liked it to be a little drier, with some more complexity. Not bad, and it certainly won't keep me from trying the other Lost Abbey brews...","bennetj17","Nov 07, 2006"
