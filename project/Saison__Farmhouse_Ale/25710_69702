4.34,1.2,5,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Very good Brett Saison. Appearance is a mammoth off-white, extremely frothy head that settles slowly, loads of lace, and a hazy orange amber color. Aroma is yeast, malt, pears, plums, spice. Flavor's similar to nose, slightly sweet at first, then a bit of carbonic tang, followed by rest of characteristics and finishing again with a bit of bittersweet. Body is very good for this style and is the soft side. Overall, quite a drinkable beer.","drpimento","Mar 30, 2015"

Nice crisp and dry finish with a moderate level of carbonation. I'd like to age a few bottles to see how the brettanomyces continues to develop. I feel the additional aging would help create more depth and complexity. Nonetheless, very enjoyable.","Jmamay22","Mar 24, 2015"

The flavors were of sweet malt and some hops; no unpleasant sourness to be discerned, which was in direct contrast with the nose. Wonderful mouthfeel and medium body with no indication of its 8% ABV made this go down quick and easy. It's a delicious and very interesting and complex brew, but such an easy and pleasant drink that I was extremely pleased with giving the style a shot. Will have again.","LouZ","Mar 06, 2015"

Tart is the first impression on the taste buds. Lacing is impressive. A bit of lemon/citrus starts to peek through & a lingering in the palate is both unctous & dry. Not at all unpleasant.

In fact among dry Belgians, this feels especially light for an 8% beer. The big barnyard funk aroma dominates and rolls through the flavor with a mix of citrus rind and spicy floral notes. There's a mild bitterness on par with Saison Dupont and the hops blend nicely in the bret. Hell of a beer, but I would like a touch more body to carry the flavor. Just a little more malt maybe, but it's still an excellent saison.","tempest","Nov 14, 2014"

4.35,1.4,,,,,,"Pours with a good thick head that dissipated nearly as fast as it came. Glad the bottle recommended leaving the yeast in the bottle cause there was a crapload.  Smells of sweet strawberries and tart raspberries. Starts off sweet and malty and slightly malty. Taste then drifts fruity with strawberry, blueberry and blackberry--both sweet and tart. Mild yeastiness finishes in with the tart fruit and also some lemon along with a mouthwatering saltiness. Almost gose like flavors here. As it warmed up a little, I even tasted a bit of pinot noir at the end. Definitely a tiny bit of oaky fruity wine. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the 8.0%. I really like the fruitiness at the end. Very nice!","constantine_272","Aug 26, 2014"

Aroma of rustic malt with light funky yeasty notes is quite sublime. Taste is dominated by dry rustic notes with some funky yeast notes and a dry floral finish. Dry Brett notes are clearly identifiable but are not overwhelming and keep the malt base flavours intact.

Dusty cellar, hay, berries, earth, light citrus, and a general spicy sharpness. Taste goes in a more fruity-funk direction starting off tart with a building sweetness being cutoff by a nice acidity and dry finish. Definitely more of a tart, juicy Brett character with this Saison. Flower petals, white wine, and peach pits...not as old and funky-feeling as the smell. Crisp and dry which helps conceal the strength. One of the more interesting Saisons I've had, I think.","wedge","Jul 09, 2014"
4.31,0.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Initially large creamy peach colored head made of tight foam bubbles over golden orange beer. Aroma pours in loads of fruit, wild floral, tart funky, and sunny dandelions. Really fun to smell.... Berries, apples, mango, colorful flowers, sweet orange, spice and pleasant but unusual tropical stink. Taste passes through an array of experiences. Miscellaneous fleshy fruits, dry, smacky, tart, citrus rind-like bitter, flowery and farmy. Carbonation is very fine and evenly disbursed. Juicy, bubbly, slick texture with an easy drinking medium body. Goes down very smooth even with the tart bitterness. There's enough fruit and sunny flowers to balance all that out.","tastybeer","Jul 07, 2014"

Scents of sour brett yeast, apricot, fruity esters and some spicy Belgian yeast. Despite the sour overtones there is a nice underlying frutiness that is the hallmark of a good saison. Very nice, wild, yet very much a saison. Flavor is quite sour upfront with a lemony character alongside sour green apple and green grape skin. In the middle the sourness continues but hints of pepper are also present. Finish is dry and sour with some slightly grainy notes. Aftertaste is sour brett yeast and lemon. A very good, sour saison with a large amount of sourness, yet still with the backbone of the style present. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying feel. Good, true to style and quite nice. Overall this is an excellent sour saison that provides a good wild sour ale but also an excellent saison. The flavors, aroma and mouthfeel mingle to make this one quite enjoyable. Highly recommended.","Auraan","May 11, 2014"

Pours a dull orange hue with a hazy clarity and a fluffy, two inch bright white head that exhibits excellent retention. Head eventually settles into a half inch cap with thick, textured swaths of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose is a bit subdued, but I get tangernine, zest and a hint of spice - it all comes off a bit witte-like. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a mild Brett presence towards the middle/back - it's not overly bold and has just a slightly medicinal character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a trace of acidity. Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this one a bit more than the standard Seizoen; however, I was expecting a bit more Brett. Perhaps some extended cellaring might help bring that quality out.","Jwale73","Jan 15, 2014"

I have a feeling that the Brett they are using comes naturally in the barrel, and rather, it further accentuates the fruit and spice notes, as well as the intriguing addition of pear juice that produces secondary fermentation. I'd imagine this would age very well in the bottle - it'd be a little less fruit forward and green, but the dryness and spice plethora would make it even more vinous than it even is. Every variant of their Saizoen series has been fantastic, but for the sake of everyday drinking, this is probably my favorite - and also one of my favorite farmhouse ales made in the US, period.","magictacosinus","Oct 13, 2013"

Crisp aroma, brett, fruit salad, wet grass, indistinct spice, floral hops. Taste was crisp and clean as well, light barnyard funk, citrus bringing in a very mellow sourness, essence of pear and peach, white wine, grassy, floral, light spices with a drop of honey sweetness. Not sure how old this bottle was, but regardless, it seemed at its peak.

The pear is easily picked up and adds a sweetness that makes this beer so drinkable. I didn't realize that pear juice was utilized, but you can tell right away.

Fantastic aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and brett notes, with moderate malt balance. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, peach, pear, apple, clove, pepper, floral, grass, wheat, and spicy yeast earthiness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, pineapple, clove, pepper, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and Brett ester flavors; with light-moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

3.98,-7.2,4,4,4,3.75,4,"a special treat from my rare beer club, decanted after sessioning my homebrew saison to compare how the brett affects this style of brew. the pour on this is pale straw color and hazy with an inch of white head that leaves nice lacing. the nose has a lot of funk to it, some lemon zest and wild yeast. the taste is light, just simple white wheat malt and the crazy yeast and brett, its different than most, lighter, less fruity really, and very summery, pollen heavy, honey sweetness is slight towards the finish. I wouldn't get pear juice if it didn't say so. its super dry, which is nice, but I wish there was more carbonation in this, it just doesn't have the brightness I like in the genre. plenty drinkable though, and a well hidden alcoholic strength. a solid beer overall, and I was impressed with its simplicity yet dynamic flavor profile. a little more carbonation would make this world class, and it has me inspired to do a little experimenting with brett in my own beers...","StonedTrippin","Jun 06, 2013"

4.68,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"#TBS11 and #BOTG 3. Poured from bottle into Hill Farmstead glass. Pours a very cloudy golden orange/yellow color. It may be the light in the room, but the color near the top of the glass lightens to an almost yellow color. Really nice head retention, a creamy appearance of white head. Smell- bready yeast, a little bit of funk. There's a sweetness, almost fruit pear aroma to go along with the bready yeast aroma. Really nice aroma. Taste- sweet creamy breadiness, a little bit of hop bitterness on the sides of my mouth, and on the end, the twangy barnyard funk delivers a little sharp kick with a tart finish to let you know the Brett is in play. The signature of this beer is its mouthfeel (creamy, rich) and it's yeast presence (bready, Brett funk ending) and the sweet malt presence that balances out the beer perfectly. This is one that I've looked forward to for awhile and it lives up to the hype. Well done.","lnashsig","Mar 31, 2013"

The nose comprises orange juice, potting soil, buttery toffee, and a small smattering of dark greens. So much earth... The taste tones down the earth a ways, but still continues the general trend of dominance on the part of the Brett. Here, there's more of the fruity aspect of the yeast, though the earth and cobweb remain. It's all a bit much in this department, if you ask me, but it's luckily not enough to completely sink the ship of state. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, if you're a Brett fan, you'll find endless entertainment here; otherwise, your tongue might receive something of an overdose...","TMoney2591","Mar 30, 2013"

Nose of lovely fresh-hay brett, dried herbs - sage, stone fruit skin, pear, roses, dried fruits - lemon, papaya, mango, cleanly malted and mildly hopped. Lively, palate cleansing carbonation, light bodied. The overriding flavor of cleanly funky brett does great things on a crisp pils malt body. Immediately pops into a drying, dusty vitamin-c funk with flavors of dried sage, lemon, hay, and stone fruits weaving in and out.

The flavors are just too overpowering and so less focus is left for the fruit. For a true classic in this vein, try Cantillon's Fou Foune (you might have to go to Brussels for this). Fou Foune could teach this beer some lessons - it has sharp acidity that brings out the fruit, extreme complexity, and exquisite balance. Wild yeasts all the way!!","jibbyvonjibb","Jan 27, 2013"

Like the aroma there was plenty of bretty funk with citrus zest accents, good oaky character, a touch of spice alongside a little applesaucey flavor, subtle herbs and mild sweetness. The brew was medium in bdoy with a good amount of carbonation. Which had a semi sweet, mild fruity, funky, slight spice, citrusy and tart finish.

The nose was fruity, harsh, and immensely bretty. It tasted like barnyard. The mouthfeel was citrusy, slightly tart, dry, and medium bodied. Nothing about the beer qualifies it as refined (although you can't spell refined without rind...kind of like a lemon rind at points).

Some nice, peppery aromas with other tingly spices...making this smell very fresh and crisp. As the beer warms, the pear scent really come through. Somewhat funky...not as much as I was hoping for, but some definite tart aromas. Taste is initially tart! More tart than I had expected. Tart lemon and orange peel with canned pears juice flavors. Great pepper and spice to this one...tingling the tongue and the taste buds. Although the Brett was not very noticeable in the aroma, it is definitely present in the flavor. Great Brett flavor with a mellow funkiness. Some hops in the finish. Very refreshing! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, and crisp. ABV well-hidden. Drinkability is very high. Overall, it's not every day you come across a beer from a brewery you've never heard of or had anything from and are blown away.

A bit murky. The head puffs up but fades away relatively quickly. There's a wonderful depth to the saison yeast flavor in both taste and aroma. It smells like peaches, strawberries, grass, hay and fresh grain. Mild to medium funk. Compared to the normal version, the brett is easy to spot, which I had been told was not the case. It's more fruit funk than barnyard, closer to Sanctification than a funk bomb. The taste is medium tart. There's a bit too much body to call it dry, but I'm not getting much sweetness, either. It's got lemons, apples, oranges and a lightly bitter/astringent finish. Great stuff. The mouthfeel is round, though not heavy, and the finish dries it out. It's just a really tasty beer. I guess it shouldn't really be a shock that Dave Logsdon knows his way around yeast flavor, but I'm still quite impressed. It definitely stands out, even though the regular Seizoen and Kili Wit are also quite good. I'd love to try the Peach version or any other Logsdon beers.","popery","Jul 09, 2012"

4.65,8.4,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Smelling of fresh wet hay, plenty of spicy phenolics alongside some lemony citrus esters, this bright and highly carbonated hazy orange amber brew features a complex nose and flavor profile, likely due in no small part due to a brettanomyces yeast addition and bottle conditioning. Very dry, a touch grassy, with just enough barnyard on the tongue to make things interesting without overpowering the soft malt balance amidst its peppery and lemony profile. Absolutely delicious, one of the best (if not the very best) farmhouse ale I've had the privilege to enjoy. This one is worth seeking out.","geokills","Apr 14, 2012"

4.68,9.1,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Big thanks to Beerzebub for the bottle. Bottle SB 852, best by May 2016. The brew pours an orange-amber hue and is topped with a voluminous antique-white cap that deposits copious sheets of lacing upon the glass. The nose is a delicious and tantalizing melange of tart orchard fruit including underripe peach, apple and pear. There is also a very green grassy note with some undertones of white grape tannin. The whole thing is rounded out by a Brett nuance that is somewhere between Band-Aid and pineapple, and more toward the former than the latter. Taste-wise, it is very refreshing and juicy, though not terribly sweet. There are tart tropical fruity notes to lead the way: guava, passion fruit and papaya are implied along with the aforementioned orchard fruits. There is also a bit of a lemony citrus zest note. The feel is authentically Belgian, though the beer is domestic; the expansive creaminess, the balance between refreshing and toothy; they have nailed it all. A very very good beer overall; one I definitely want more of.","ktrillionaire","Jul 16, 2011"
