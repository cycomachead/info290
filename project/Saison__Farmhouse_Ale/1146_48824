Light yellow and cloudy in color- reminded me of carbonated lemon juice.  1 finger head that faded quickly with minimal lacing.  The smell was lemon citrus with a hint of pepper that carried over to the taste.  Nice mouthfeel, tiny bubbles that danced down the tongue.  This was my first Farmhouse ale.  I wasn't overly wowed by the flavors but I could see myself enjoying the refreshing Ms. Sofie on the patio during a summer afternoon.","RossiDaMan","Friday at 08:17 AM"

These particle characteristics, the wood aspect and the slightly slick mouthfeel, become more apparent as the beer warms up from fridge temperature. I did not experience the visible carbonation levels that have been reported in other reviews. Saison yeast aromas up front, you get the grassiness and some lemon scent along with a hint of white pepper that I found appealing. Somewhat hard to nail down exactly what is going on with this beer, but it's worth trying for sure.","dd43","Jan 12, 2015"

Pears, green apples, and green grapes. The slightest hint of orange peel. Mildly tart dry aftertaste with a tiny bit of funk. Creamy and bubbly like a champagne. Immensely drinkable.

Light, but complex, nose of Belgian like yeast, sweet light fruit (pear, grape, apple) and just a hint of spice.  Light medium body with a nice smooth texture made a bit prickly from the above normal carbonation level.  Effervescence is evident throughout.  The flavor profile is quite nice.  Extremely complex, very well balanced but not overly intense, it allows all flavors of the nose to emerge.  It begins with the fruit, then develops a white wine like note in the middle coupled with a bit of dryness.  The finish is where the farmhouse character emerges with an ever so slight peppery funk that fades into a mild tart dryness.  Outstanding and an excellent entry choice for the Saison style.","tillmac62","Dec 04, 2014"

4,-2.4,,,,,,"Poured from a wine bottle into a chalice. Frothy white head about 1-finger thick settles into a nice white blanket of foam. The color is a cross between champagne and cider, with a clear effervescence and a white grape color with and orange tint around the edges. Strong orange peel and white pepper aromas with some coriander and lemon zest thrown in. A bit yeasty and bready with a brut note or two on the nose as well. Flavors of bright citrus and spice, like candied orange peels. The up-front bubbles complements the tartly dry flavors and the beer finishes crisp and sweet with a bit of a tart aftertaste. Notes of cloves, allspice, coriander, pepper, oranges, bread, and green grapes round out the flavors. The feel is marked by bubbly effervescence that is truly aggressive, but in a pleasant way. Much more of a champagne feel than beer woth a bit more juicy tartness on he swallow. Overall this is a killer take on a farmhouse ale, going all-in on the flavor and feel notes that make the farmhouse ale so different from other Belgian styles. Nice work!","TangTKE402","Nov 02, 2014"

Don't get me wrong--I'm more than aware of the incredibly wide variety of flavors beer can produce. This brew, however, felt like it was wearing TOO good of a champagne costume.

4.15,1.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"765 ml large format bottle poured into a tulip glass. Slightly cloudy lemon yellow brew with a gorgeous creamy white head that retains form well, some fizzy effervescence and yeast debris floating around. Pretty beer. Wonderful nose, too ... Shockingly tropical and vinous, loads of pineapple, white grape, pear, lemon, yellow grapefruit, Juicy Fruit gum, unripe gooseberry, and dry moderately funky horse blanket. Just a hint of fresh bread. Certainly a unique farmhouse ale on nose and palate. Very quenching, dry, and sour, but with enough pear and tropical fruit to provide some balance and keep this firmly anchored outside of Orval territory (although one is tempted to draw a few comparisons). Fresh pear and pineapple galore with echoes of coriander and orange peel. Nice easy-going but still assertive brettanomyces creates an earthy dry vibe that runs parallel to the fruit element. The sour note does develop as one sips. Body on the light side, fairly high carbonation. Finishes citric, mildly floral, and bone-dry. Any malt flavor is largely buried, but if you appreciate sours or Belgian beers more generally there is much to like here. I am appreciating the meld of sweet fruit, sour fruit, and dry Belgian funk, with no one component running the show.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 21, 2014"

What a great beer. Very impressive. This stands out in an over-saturated market of American craft beer, no doubt about it. I am rating this extra high for its precision and creative approach.","Agent1","Sep 18, 2014"

3.96,-3.4,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall: A pleasant surprise as I don't recall enjoying this beer so much in the past. The stand out note for me was the brett and it's cheesy, ripe barnyard notes. As it warms the orange peel does come out a bit more and the yeast becomes more "zesty" and peppery. The wine barrel is not super prominent but then again it's only a 20% blend. Overall, given the availability of this, I'd recommended it when in need of a modestly priced brett/fruit forward saison.","CowsandBeer","Jun 21, 2014"

The aroma is a funky refreshing blend of apricots, belgian yeast, lemon peel, and wine (reminded me of pinot grigio). The mouthfeel is light, refreshing, and effervescent; perfect for the style. The flavor follows the nose and reminds me much more of a carbonated white wine than an ale. This was very good. I want to try a fresh bottle now to see the difference.","lochef81","May 28, 2014"

Multi-faceted; lots of depth to explore here. Too much bitter citrus peel for my liking but I can still give this beer respect.","abeeronthebeach","Mar 13, 2014"

While I've never been a big wine drinker, I have a soft spot for both Belgian blonde ales and certain white wines, so this brew is scratching all of the right itches for me. This is a top shelf beer and it is priced accordingly, but you will get what you pay for. Although it is not a traditional saison, I'd rank this up there with some of my favourite Belgian examples, including Dupont.","thehyperduck","Jan 05, 2014"

I was never a huge fan of this genre, yet this this is the first beer that I have given a perfect rating! Perfect golden color, great head and lacing, aroma and flavor that are unparallelled in this genre, and incredibly smooth! I usually do not like to spend a lot of money on recreation, but this is the exception to the rule. Perfect for special occasions, and I really don't feel like the caviar eating snobs can talk crap about this one.","Isrealite","Dec 28, 2013"

Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of tart lemon, apple, pear, pepper, orange peel, pineapple, wheat, hay, floral, grass, clove, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity and spicy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of tart lemon, apple, pear, clove, pepper, orange peel, wheat, hay, grass, funk, and spicy yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, citrus peel, pepper, clove, hay, grass, wheat, light funk, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, foamy, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic wild yeast saison! Outstanding complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and orange peel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; and one of my favorite easily available wild saisons.","superspak","Sep 13, 2013"

4.15,1.2,4.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought was pretty damn good beer and a very good example of a Farmhouse Ale, the brett was pretty apparent in the aroma, but when it came to the taste it showed up just enough and it helped intensify those great citrus flavors that I really enjoyed. This beer had pretty good drinkability, It wouldn't be hard for me to a drink a few of these and I could see them going pretty fast on a warm summer day, it was smooth, clean, not filling, and the flavors did a really nice job at holding my attention. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to the style it was, it had all the aspects that I look for in a very good Farmhouse Ale. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad, but it had me prepared for a Brett bomb like Matilda was, but it was a different story when I got to the taste. I would for sure buy this beer again and I would like to have a couple more bottles of this Vintage to see how it changes over time, I also wouldn't mind trying a fresh one for comparison. It was priced nicely also. I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of Farmhouse ales. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, when I got to the aroma I started to doubt this beer, but the taste was pretty much a different story and I can't remember the last time that I had a beer that the aroma was so different from the taste like this beer was. Great job guys, I really like this Belgian Series and it's the only beers from Goose Island that I go out of my way to look for and this might just be the best one in the series so far. Great job guys, I think goose island is doing great things with these Belgian style beers, and I can't seem to get enough of them.","StoutHunter","Sep 09, 2013"

Did not taste much of the peppery or subtle spicness that I get from other Saisons. Not sure if I picked up any orange peel (as the beer said it has in 20% of the belgian ale mixed in), maybe it contributes to the lemony flavor. Overall the flavor profile was nice, very easy drinking. It had a light bodied mouthfeel. I like it, will drink again but hope to try it on tap.","Benish","Jul 23, 2013"

It offers up a little spice, a little sour and some florals. As it warms it gives some cracker, some medicinal alcohol and clove. Grainy with a touch of sweetness. Taste follows the nose all the way and pucker up because its tart. Flavors all come together, lemony citrus, bread, yeast,a little pepper. Taste doesn’t quite live up to the nose but it’s close. Sharp on the tongue at first but you get used to it . Sweet, tangy, finishes earthy, crisp and slightly bitter. This was tremendously flavorfull and off dry.

Slightly wine like acidity with a yeasty finish. The mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation and a dry finish.

I don't think I've had a Belgian style ale from Goose Island I haven't enjoyed, and this is no exception. If I had to find a fault, it's that the spiciness can become a little cloying over time, but this is a minor grievance. Otherwise, this is a crisp, complex, flavorful saison that represents the style ably.","MaximalC","May 29, 2013"

A clovelike yeasty aroma first hits me, then some more peppery spice and citric notes, mostly orangepeel, along with something akin to sour apple or pear (a touch of funk one might say). This beer is light, easy to drink although at times there is this puckering tartness that doesn't detract from the beer but makes it a very slow sipper. For some reason the not-real-word "wineish" comes up as I seem to get this sour apple/pear and white grape taste, then the Belgian charteristics come out with a spicy orange citric taste and touches of sweet fruit. The yeast keeps it smooth and the carbonation keeps it lively and it's an all around relaxing ale to sip on, but one of those rare beers that I simply would not want a second bottle.","clayrock81","May 18, 2013"

I taste green apples too, tart and sweet at the same time, although this beer adds a dry element to that flavor. wine-like fruity vibes, and a similar acidity. I view this so much more as a fall beer, rather than a spring one. its got all the leaf changing colors feel to it. really mellow on the citrus, and I don't get any vanilla at all. ultra bright carbonation and a clean dry finish. light bodied and drinkable, but I wonder if the sale of goose island has effected the recipe or the quality of this beer. I remember it being so wonderful and interesting, and now it just seemed like another half hearted saison. maybe its me, and ive had too many good beers to recognize that this one is special, but it seems somehow dumbed down to me now.","StonedTrippin","May 11, 2013"

The 6.5% ABV does not intrude at all, and the fine carbonation, though a bit too harsh, pairs with the flavor profile to create a refreshing saison that won't knock you out. A light, dry saison that's at its best during the warm summer months.","gr0g","Feb 25, 2013"

Definitely the kind of beer I was looking for, and one of the drier Saisons I've had. I would have liked to see a higher ABV to try and get a little bit of booziness and malt sweetness to really make the buttery note shine, but at 6.5% Sofie does a fine job.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly yeasty (basement, cement), with notes of gum/banana, lemon candy, and pepper. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

If you are a fan of saison/farmhouse ales this is a must experience. I am fascinated with farmhouse ales and this brings a new but nice change to a fabulous style of ales. I'm actually surprised this is available year round. Not something id drink in the cold winter months as this thing screams late spring/summer style brew for me. It has a good style and flair to it. I'll buy again without a doubt.","BradtheGreat7","Aug 10, 2012"

3.95,-3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a slightly hazy straw/piss yellow with a fire storm of bubbles escaping from the bottom of the glass and reminding me of champagne. The head lasts awhile at a finger width and is made of big and velvety bubbles that leave a lightly sticky and sliding lacing on the glass. The beer smells damp and fruity with a nice spicy kick. The wine barrels that the beer sat in also seem to be present as a ghost in the smell. There is some great citrus orange in the smell and a nice slight farmhouse funk. The beer tastes tart and fruity with an oh-so-slight biscuity malt background. The spices are subtler in the taste, though the orange peel distinctly kicks through in the fruitiness of the beer. A sweet, perhaps chardonnay flavor ghosts in the beer, and the farmhouse funk is present slightly as it plays with the biscuit malts, but the sweet orange citrus is the first big flavor in the beer. On further sips I also started detect nice bananay yeast, reminiscent of Matilda, which is quite nice. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and citrusy, but the sweet malt takes over more and leaves a nice glaze in the mouth. Mouthfeel is a little sharp from the initial sip with carbonation, but not too much so. The beer then mellows into a velvety clean caramel on the tongue and washes down nicely leaving slight saliva and the ghost of a tingle, and nothing else. Overall, I think this is a solid citrus saison. It reminds me of Le Merle from North Coast Brewing, only I like Sofie more in flavor and in the fact that the carbonation isn’t assaulting my tongue. Good saison, though I tend to like the spice-sentric ones more than the citrus ones, this beer is worthy of a try, though, and another lovely Belgian Style Ale by Goose Island.","Maxwell","Jul 26, 2012"

The nose has lots of black pepper, and solid secondary note of citrusy orange peel. For all that went into this beer though (brett, wine barrel aging), I was expecting a bit more life and variety in the aroma. I definitely find it in the flavor profile though. There's a bit of bready sweetness that flashes at the front of each sip. It's followed by the orange peel and pepper interplay that so thoroughly dominates the nose. As the beer warms a little bit though, some earthy brett funk and a touch of acidity that's very reminiscent of white wine begin to shine through as supporting notes. The body is dry, but could probably stand to be a little more light yet. The carbonation is plenty active. It took a little time to get going, but Goose Island's Sofie is a very tasty, complex take on the saison style.","axeman9182","Jul 02, 2012"

Flavor follows the nose, as all of those same elements I got in the smell come together very well in the flavor. It's very much a full-flavored saison, something I really appreciate. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with heavy carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, I think this is a highly underrated beer. For a year round, off the shelf saison, it really knocks it out of the park. It's a beer I always keep in my fridge and will drink again and again.","starrdogg","May 07, 2012"

White pepper, oak, belgian yeast, coriander, and orange peel dominate the aroma. Add some lemon zest and... viognier(?) barrels to that and you've pretty much got the flavor profile right there. It's light, aromatic, and with a nice balance of spicy, sweet, and citrus for a warm evening. It doesn't wow me the way some Saisons have (I'm looking at you, Saison L'Hiver!), but I'm certainly glad I've tried it.","fvernon","Apr 23, 2012"

Let's fix it: She pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, sour wheat, pepper, dank oak, and spicy white grapes. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, orange peel, cardamom, wheat, black pepper, and spicy white wine grapes. As nice as the flavors come across, it's not as good as the smell would have me believe. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a tasty, refreshing Belgian treat. Good times.","TMoney2591","Jan 12, 2012"

I want more funk/meat in this beer. It's too refined and sweet for my tastes. Feel is very light, with low carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Some funk again in the aftertaste.

Smell is a little funky and musky, a bit yeasty and kind of oaky in the nose. Taste is similar to the nose a little drying on the end with hints of citrus fruits, (orange peel) sweet yeast presence a touch of white grapes (chardonnay barrel aging) musky oak presence is evident but all together well balanced.

When it all settles down it pours a mostly clear golden straw color with a pillowy white head that sticks around forever. Smells sweet and fruity with lemons and green apples dominating the aroma. There's some funk in there that reminds me a bit of spoiled meat? Luckily its not to strong but its there. Taste is a bit sweet, green apples and honey mixed with a bit of funk. Spirited level of carbonation, medium body, sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. Despite the misstep upon opening, this beer isn't half bad.","johnnnniee","Sep 16, 2011"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, funk, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, wheat, slight funk, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This is the beer myself and beermeX2 used to warm up our palates while waiting for the others to arrive.

3.79,-7.6,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy golden color with a one finger white head. As I drink the beer it leaves a little bit of lacing in my tulip glass. The smell has a nice fruity sweetness to it, a smell I can't exactly place, it seems like strawberry and a touch of mango and citrus. It also smells slightly acidic. The taste starts with a fruity sweetness, in the middle of the taste I get some light malts and towards the end it tastes a little bit sour. Mouthfeel is a medium, with energetic carbonation. Overall, this is a very different take on a Saison style, but I prefer a more traditional saison.","gkunkle","Jun 04, 2011"

Nice touches of coriander, lemon, hints of pepper coming through, with a touch of pears warming up to it as it came up to room temperature. The initial taste was peppery, with a rush of lemon following suit almost immediately. A wonderful sense of light fruit really just ran all over this one. I was quite impressed I have to admit. Smooth mouth feel was more the adequately carbonated and really just kept the profile popping throughout. An easy sipper, the moderate ABV lended itself well to a warm late summer evening.","mikesgroove","Jun 03, 2011"

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I must admit...the post on the Goose Island web site mentioning this batch may be tainted got me thinking....and drinking. Here we go...pours a light yellow colored ale with a huge white foamy head with nice lacing. The aroma is fruity with apples, pears and some nice wine characteristics. Pleasing. The taste is good with some funk mixed in. Floral, dark fruits and a bit of wildness on the tail end. Lingering orange peel on the aftertaste which is actually quite nice. The wine seems to have disappeared but I carry on. Overall I think this brew really hits the Saison style. A lot of the American-ized Saisons are off the mark but this stays true to the style. Throwing in the 20% Belgian aged in wine barrels is a nice twist. A good beer on bottled on 2/11/11 but am curious to see how this would turn out in 4+ years as the bottle states it can develop. Will probably buy another to age and see the difference.","kaseydad","Jun 03, 2011"

4.45,8.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Even a careful pour yields near three fingers of loose and delicate bone white foam, looks like whipped egg whites, dimples a lot as it rapidly dissolves down to the surface, minimal stickiness to the lacing. Bright golden hued liquid with decent clarity, what is does have is a veritable maelstrom of bubbles swirling inside, light enough that there’s no discernible loss at the glass bottom or rims. The nose is a tightly woven series of jabs, mostly white grapefruit and mandarin orange, apple, pear and peach scents with an emphasis on skin, flower blossoms and golden honey, moments of clove and pepper, yeast and perhaps a slight briny influence along with moss and other forest floor matter. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is too foamy at first but does subside some with time, also churns things sufficiently to dampen overall sourness. Lemon, white grapefruit, mineola oranges a fine pair for the clove, coriander, cumin spices. The yeast and bread neither too dry nor sweet, helps anchor the whole in the center. Were there more tang and sugar there might be a tropical character to the apple, nectarine, apricot, pear, red cherry fruit. The grassiness keeps it on the lowdown, tickles the tonsils without looking to get up in your face. Factoring for the carbonation, it’s really not that sweet and the high degree of citrus keeps it on the refreshing side of things, good drinkability. (Bottled on 2/19/10.)","farrago","0"

The taste is awesome, and although appears dry upfront has nice sweetness in the background that tastes almost juicelike.

The flavor is dry and hoppy and spicy and features notes of citrus, some tartness, some pineapple, lemon rind, non descript fruit, some pineyness, and some bubblegum.

At first a tart, citrusy flavor, and follows with some sweeter oaky, vanilla flavors. Drinks very much like a wine. Light to medium body with fizzy carbonation and snappy finish.

I would prefer less carbination and a bit more sweetness, but that is totally my individual taste (I love tripels) and all the saisons share these characteristics.

As it opens up it's got more of the barnyard going on. Originally I thought there was too much orange in this, but honestly, after sitting out and open for a couple days, I like it even better. Still has its carbonation, stains dripping down on the glass, the barn door left open this time, obscuring the orange trees.

The wine is much more prominent in the taste with a good yeasty backbone. The orange peel is also very nice. The carbonation is very lively and it gives the beer a very light mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is superb, with a perfect carbonation level to complement the medium consistency and clean, bitter finish. Leaves me wanting another sip with ease.

Smells of bready pils malt, peachy/citrusy hops, and peppery spice complemented by subtle barnyard funk. In some way it reminds me of the aged manure we were given for our garden by a local farmer this spring. The aroma has a real subtlety and depth to it. Citrus hop flavour is enhanced by the addition of orange peel while the beer is aging in the barrel. Mild lemony tartness goes well with that citrus flavour. A light dusting of pepper is followed by a mild bitterness in the finish. Light-bodied and dry with loads of fine carbonation. Feels soft and velvety, like the mousse of champagne. A refined, elegant, classy beer full of comple subtelty. Delicious.","mintjellie","Jul 16, 2010"

Smells soft, flowery and yeasty. Can't detect any barrel or brett. The flavor is typical of a basic saison, maybe a little more depth. Black pepper, cloves and clover honey is what I taste from the yeast. Grassy noble hops and basic malt backbone. Smooth luxorious mouth feel, coats the tongue. Could be a bit drier for a saison.

Drying on the finish, this beer has a wonderful light body that's got just enough heft, quite wheaty, and a delicate, drying finish. This is where the Brett comes through, mildly barnyardy, mildly bandaid like, and a touch spicy. It definitely isn't as prominent as it is on the nose, something that I find surprising.

Pours a pale orange, with a huge fluffy, billowing head (maybe 2 1/2 fingers at least) which settled to a nice thin layer with great retention and webbed lacing. Smell from the bottle was initially very citrusy and fresh, and was quite the same when poured. Very floral, citrusy (lemons, orange) and a touch of spice. Taste is quite similar, crisp, citrusy. Touch of sweetness, and the malt feels quite organic and earthy. Just delightful. High carbonation on this one (initially seen with the head on the pour), but fits the bill just perfect.

Aroma has some light esters evoking fruit salad, including apple, pear, and banana. Some clove notes lead me to believe this is made with some wheat. Nice smooth spiciness, also getting some vanilla. Flavor is bright and slightly tart, some lemon now emerging with the banana pith. Distinct but very well-integrated pepper note, along with mild notes of cooking herbs. Fruity tropical hops blend well with the esters, just like in the better Belgian IPAs. Light honeyed malts provide a soft background for all the yeasty and hoppy complexity. Dry finish, but not in an astringent way, which is a very significant accomplishment for a beer partially aged in wine barrels. Crisp and clean, a little hefty to be considered refreshing.

4.42,7.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from the nice looking 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass, Sofie has a monstrously huge white head and the beer itself is a slightly hazy white grape color. Almost looks like Champagne but with more head. The nose is complex; fruit and spice stand out as what's there but there is quite a depth to both. The fruitiness reminds me of pears, apples, white grapes and maybe a touch of peach and a bit of citrus in the form of orange blossoms. The spice is slightly phenolic, a bit peppery and generally more reserved than the fruit. Very nice indeed. The taste is similar in terms of components but the spice character definitely dominates. Fruity and sweet up front, it transitions to spicy and slightly dry with a bit of funk... but in a good way. Based on taste alone, I would guess this beer had more than 6.5% ABV, it seems more present than in some well done bigger Belgians I've had before. The beer has a nice mouthfeel, fuller than I had expected, maybe medium bodied, and the carbonation while reserved is still present but not in an effervescent way. Overall a very drinkable beer but one that should be savored, it would be interesting to save a bottle of this for a few years to see how it develops, but I'm not sure I have the constitution to do that~!","gmfessen","Apr 01, 2010"

Thin, whispy white head. Smelled like chardonnay. Taste was amazing. Coriander, lemon peel, and orange flavors abound, followed softly by the aging in the wine barrels. So subtle but present. A perfect amount of blending by the brewer. Mouthfeel was so spot on for a saison. It was crisp and refreshing, but quenching all the while. About halfway through, you could actually feel the abv a bit. A great beer to have with a meal or anytime. This was a steal to pay retail price in a restaurant.

Poured a semi-translucent, slightly hazy pale yellow-gold with a loose, two inch bright white cap, that sizzles and pops as it quickly dissipates into a fizzy skim with a frothy band around the shoulders. Nose reveals lemon zest, candi sugar and a slightly herbal/grassy quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit muted, but a little more coalesced - but its the mouthfeel that hits you first with an aggressive, just shy of prickly carbonation that immediately confronts you upon the first sip. It actually took a minute for that experience to diffuse a little before I could begin to recognize the flavors. Body is light-medium, with a slightly oily quality and a bit of acidity that stimulates the salivary glands only slightly towards the back of the cheeks. Carbonation re-asserts itself at the finish with a light, lingering burn. All and all, I found Sofie to be tasty and moderately refreshing, but a little too clean for a Saison. Closer to a Saison/Belgian Strong Pale in my opinion. Nonetheless a tasty and respectable offering from GI.","Jwale73","Mar 20, 2010"

Pours quite light, yellowy and clear, the head is eggshell, initially quite impressive, slow morph to meraingue and 1/2 inch froth, leaves the expected quality, thicker and sticky lace. The nose is loaded with lemony fruit, yeasty nuttyness and general Belgian style spiced up yummyness. The final pour is yeast infused and produces a cloudy look. Notes on the tongue and mouth include more yeasty nuttyness, moderate pepper, tropical fruit, and hoppy herbaliciousness. Simply yummy. Complex, flavorful, delicate yet full of flavor and interest. Huge ups for the quality take on the style. A bargain price for this high qality brew. Wish I picked up 2 or more bottles, which sums things up..","Billolick","Beers"

The aroma was fresh, pleasant and bright. I detected citrus zest, crystal malt, an array of spices and floral hops. The flavors were very zesty with so much citrus, especially grapefruit, that it was difficult to pull much more out of it at first. The yeast and malt characters were harder to discern but I did get a general doughiness along with a pleasant yet bitter floral hops finish. No doubt a great summer beer complete with a medium body, light/medium carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. Quaffable, acidic enough to pair well with food and very sessionable. Try it, like it.","thekevlarkid","Jan 22, 2010"

Medium full body with effervescent carbonation and fruity, dry finish. Body has strong grain and malt basis with a nice balance of spice and fruit (orange peel, coriander, pepper, lemon zest, grape, etc).

The second pour from the bottle resulted in a slight haze as the yeast gets mixed in. Light vinous qualities in the aroma with hints of white grapes. Yeast phenols add some spice kick but overall the aroma is a bit understated. Things pick up with the flavor. More of the spice comes into play. Hints of cloves and pepper. Slightly fruity. Finishes extremely dry. Not a flavor that I would call rustic or typical Saison. Very clean and crisp in comparison to others in the style.

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"First beer of the night for New Year's Eve is Goose Island Sofie. Nice to see that this brewery is now distributed in Mass. Color is a hazy straw/gold with a white heading that has some serious lasting power. Very interesting smells going on such as a bit of basement must, wild flowers, orange peel, and something reminds me of lime. Very crisp and floral taste profile. I get some raw grain, green apple, pear, just a very bright tasting Saison. Mouthfeel is on the light side, and at times appears to be bordering on Witbier status. Drinkability is simply superb, and the lower ABV helps to make this an easy brew to consume. This is a top notch example of this style. Goose Island really hit a grand slam with this offering. I cannot wait till their Sour beer, Juliet, makes its way out to these parts as well. Cheers and Happy New Year.","jamie2dope","Dec 25, 2009"

Having spent a lot of time on my grandparent's farm as a kid, anything with a wheat/grain smell reminds me of grain elevators and cattle feed. So, subconsciously, I'm all ready biased against the style, although I love my grandparent's and the farm. Go figure. Anyway, This had a dark yellow coloring with no head at all. The sediment rests on the bottom of the glass as it settles. The flavor is "grainy", for lack of a better term and I think this may work well with a food pairing. It didn't do it for me as a stand alone beer. It's a little sweeter than I expected, and that only hurts the drinkability for me.

Earthy, herbal hops, grass, hay, a slight musty funk, and lemon zest. The flavor is much more complex. Basic Saison flavors come through. Grassy hops, hay, earthy mustiness, and white pepper. Orange rind comes through as does a slight vinous character that comes through on the tail of the flavor profile. Just a slight grape sweetness. The mouthfeel is light and crisply carbonated.

With clove, pepper and yeast rounding things out. The flavor follows the aroma fairly closely. Green apples and lemon are rather prominent yet thet are nicely balanced by a sweetness that caps the sourness of those fruits. Strong clove and pepper spice abounds with every sip.

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A good saison - as I mentioned above, this one's stylistically spot on, authentic, and sports the spice, the fruit, the esters, the subtle and well-attenuated wheaty sweetness. Though there are a few things that just don't click for me, this one is by and large very drinkable, and at 6.5% it's only marginally more alcoholic than your standard IPA or pale ale. Drink up, as this one's very solid.","CrellMoset","Aug 01, 2009"

4.12,0.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours golden clear and with a little amber hue. Very quick head that leaves only ring of foam after the pour. Ok bubbling. The aroma makes me think of champagne and light triple sec. Very dry triple sec. Dry champagne and riesling wine notes mingle with toasted pilsner malts. The hops add just a hint of earthy funk to the whole palate of this beer. the","scruffwhor","Jul 26, 2009"

4.22,2.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a great saison from GI and extremely drinkable with plenty of sweetness in the aroma and some earthy characteristics that come through more in the taste. A great summer afternoon beer.","gford217","Jul 23, 2009"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Goose Island Sofie poured very pale, slightly cloudy with a very good head and good lacing. The smell was full of nice citrus notes. The taste was full of crisp sweetness, with fruit flavors of apricots. Showed a slight hop bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel was good, nice carbonation. Drinkability was nice. This was a nice ale. I enjoyed a good deal. I hope they continue to produce it.","nickynick","Jul 17, 2009"
3.86,-5.9,3,4.5,3.5,3,4.5,"D - The dryness in the mouthfeel definitely leaves me wanting more, and the great aroma makes me happy to keep bringing it back. The crispness makes this smooth and easy on this extremely hot summer night in Los Angeles. Yes, this could be an everyday go-to beer for me, if it were readily available. And the lack of anything overwhelming at any stage of the game this makes this even more "drinkable."","route66pubs","Jul 17, 2009"

4.03,-1.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a lightly veiled straw with a classic, rocky head that leaves a thick, resilient lacing behind. Smell is light corriander, lemon zest, and a faint smell of oak. This beer is proof that subtlety and complexity can coexist. The taste starts with light lemon tartness and yeasty breadiness with some coriander underneath. The finish has flavors of citrus peel and some oaked chardonnay (I don't drink white wine, but it's kind of fun to pick that up in a beer). You'll do fine swapping in Sofie for white wine pairings (salads, light fish or asian flavors). According to the label, this will develop for up to five years. Looking forward to what the next five years have to offer.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 11, 2009"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Reviewed on 06/04/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a cloudy very light yellow. Aroma of funky barnyard and sweettart candies. Flavor is very similar--with more of a sour bend along with the sweet tartness. Very smooth, light on the palate, and mellow. Good stuff!","LilBeerDoctor","Jul 09, 2009"

Lots of carbonation. Coriander and orange peel in the aroma. Fairly light bodied. Spicy finish from the yeast. More citrus and orange peel. Very dry. After drinking the Juliet, this was a bit of a let down. Nothing wrong with it, but it just didn't do a whole lot for me.","homebrewhawk","Jul 08, 2009"

3.52,-14.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"D: Yes this is quite a lot to expect from a beer, to match such a specific expectation, but that self important label, the passively decant bottle design that if it were a person would probably smoke Camel Turkish Golds and speak in nothing but back handed compliments. Not quite sure why that would make the contents of said bottle any good, but I've had great experiences with Goose Island in the past and didn't think it would be any different in this case. Oh well. This beer is probably worth another try, but for now it will just have to stay how it is.","bluemoonswoon","Jun 24, 2009"
3.71,-9.5,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Fresh 22oz bomber purchased for $7.99 at Armenetti's. This beer is clear, golden straw color, thick wet foam with thin dry lacing. The aroma is exceptional, an American saison that I like for once! I'm guessing amarillo hops are the source of the citrus aromas, which contrast nicely with the spicy Belgian yeast and sharp pepper. The taste is sweet and peppery in a complementary way, I think the closest description is a tripel dry hopped with amarillo. Not sure if this matches my image of saison (i.e. DuPont) but then this style covers a wide range of topographies. The body is more or less normal, very carbonated and maybe this adds to the peppery taste. An extremely good beer overall, and I appreciate the lower price point after recently paying about $16 for Juliet.","TurdFurgison","Jun 10, 2009"
4.05,-1.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy fizzy yellow with a big 'ol three finger bright white head that falls to a thin foamy layer. Some thick spots of clingy lace holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma is crisp and spicy. Lemon zest, some cinnamon, and a touch of lime. Underneath all the fruitiness is the slightest bit of pepper. Not much funk/brett with this, but still an enjoyable sniffer. Taste begins with the zesty citrus fruits followed by some dry earthy flavors. Some funky brett, a touch of honey, and green apples midway, but for some reason the flavor fades rather quickly leading to a brief peppery aftertaste. Light and fluffy body with a lively feel from the full carbonation, spot on for the style. This is one of the better beers I've had from GI for sure, but I wish the flavor would just hold on longer. I would have no problem drinking this again, thanks again Tim!","BeerTruth","May 30, 2009"

The slight barrel aging and added orange peel has done wonders for the complexity of this beauty. It's not the most traditional of saisons but I'd have to say it's my new, favorite American saison. Good job guys!","joe1510","Apr 29, 2009"

3.82,-6.8,4,4.5,3.5,3,4,"This is a really nice blended Saison style from Goose. It's got a nice effervescence and aromas of citrus and orange. The orange peel really comes through in the flavor, my only complaint is it's still slightly young on the palate. It's a bit dry on the finish, but I think it's got some great potential to shape up really nicely!","Benjiehorn","Apr 05, 2009"

4.5,9.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: This is a fantastic Saison. While not a funky Brett bomb or a citrus explosion, it contains both of those elements, to varying degrees. It also contains a fair amount of green & grassy hops that in no way steps on anything else going on here. Everything works in concert with everything else here and is, dare I say, one of the finest examples of the style I've ever tasted...","GbVDave","Apr 01, 2009"

Dry finish with some noble hop herbals. Utterly quaffable and refreshing. I've only experienced this soft lightness before in a few Belgians, namely Fantome, Troublette, and other rustic-style Saisons & Wits. This is one i'll return to again and again.
