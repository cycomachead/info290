There is also quite a bit of tartness, lemon and light funk. The flavor is similar. The biscuit and toffee malt go very well with the wheat and a little bit of tartness. The light acidic notes work very well and add to the beerâ€™s drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","jbaker67","Sep 02, 2013"

Well, perhaps it didn't quite live up to my godly expectations, but it was still a damn good beer. I enjoyed the saison and funk flavors that come through and pound hard from middle to end - but my main complaint is that the guava (and fruit in general) was too muted, both in the aroma and the taste.

Pours hazy orange amber color with a big 3 finger fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, lemon, orange zest, pineapple, guava, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes. Taste of apple, pear, lemon, orange zest, guava, pepper, clove, wheat, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, guava, citrus, pepper, clove, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice complexity of fruity and spicy flavors; with great fruity/peppery flavor balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Very high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, very crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison style. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2013"

It caries the tropical flavors that blend nicely with a medium sweet-dry matliness with an interesting short or 1/2 bitter taste, has a sourness to it. Distinct Guava comes through as it warms.

4.08,2.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a beautifully hazy golden orange with a massive four finger mountainous head. Looks amazing! The aroma is slightly tart with tons of banana and pineapple. Guava is coming through, but banana and pineapple dominate. There is a decent amount of clove coming through as well. The taste is absolutely incredible. Slightly tart in the front, but banana and clove shine all the way through. Guava and pineapple are present, but take a backseat to the banana and clove. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is relatively high. Overall, incredible interpretation of a farmhouse ale. I definitely taste some funk, but nowhere near a traditional Saison such as Dupont. Easy to drink and bursting with juicy flavor. A very unique brew and one that I recommend highly.","hmf05","Oct 26, 2011"

3.86,-3.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thick, fluffy white head that fills almost half the glass. Aroma is almost overwhelmingly strong, to the point where it hits you the second the beer touches the glass. There's a strong acidic citrus smell with a lot of barnyard funk. The taste is extremely tart upfront with a lot of different citrus flavors coming together from the hops and yeast, a strong grapefruit, lemon, and of course guava presence. There's a bit of alcohol heat and yeast esters as well. The sour, tart flavors cover up a lot of the flavors at first, but as it warms up a lot more subtle notes come out. Carbonation is high with a super dry finish, combining with the tartness to make this one a real lip pucker-er. Somewhere between a Wild Ale and a Saison. A nice beer with tons and tons of things going on. Thanks for the chance to try it nugganooch!","charliedvrs","Sep 01, 2011"

4.42,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch fizzy orange-white head that settles to a foamy cap. Thick streaks of foamy lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is extremely funky and acidic with vinegar and sour fruit aromas. A very mouthwatering smell. Taste is of sour fruits, vinegar, and funk. A subtle guava taste comes through on the aftertaste after each sip. The carbonation level on this one is high with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is more like a sour than a saison. I have read that some of the earlier bottles were infected and I think this may be one of them. However, this is an extremely pleasant beer even with an infection in it. I am glad I got to try this "version".","UCLABrewN84","Aug 30, 2011"

Unfortunately when there is no bottle date on a beer, this can happen. I will seek to give this (among other cigar city offerings) a second chance with a trade directly from the source. I have had a mix of things I really liked, and a mix of things I was incredibly disappointed with. The latter usually being an infected or otherwise compromised bottle. I don't wish to post this review as a form of slander, but it helps me document a negative experience with the hopes of eventually redeeming it.

4.57,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer was just great. Instead of the extreme tartness and sourness the old Guava Grove presented, this one presented a great Saison funkiness that paired very well with the up-front guava notes to make a delicious smelling and tasting beer. The drinkability is probably the beer's finest hour, if this is still clocking in at around 8%, it's some sort of miracle, since it now drinks like it's a 4.5% beer! Seriously. Try the new Guava Grove. It's really, really good.","shand","Jul 24, 2011"
3.92,-1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Nice pour into a Russian River snifter glass, pours a hazy orange with a big two finger head that starts to subside after a minute or two, head never totally disappears. With the first smell, Belgian session sort of grassy but then, quickly overtaken by the smell of guava, the finish is almost like I'm standing in a citrus grove. I pick up other citrus fruits beside guava as well, oranges. The taste characteristics almost mirror the smell, farmhouse session up front with the guava coming through strong in the finish. Not like biting into the fruit itself but, the taste you would get from the juice, slightly sour with some grapefruit taste as well. Sour on the aftertaste. Citrus, orange, guava and grapefruit juices mixed together. Nice and crisp, light bodied with balanced amount of carbonation. Great beer to drink on a Summer day!","GradyS1","Jul 23, 2011"

Sour/tartness really gives this a wildness and makes it hard to think of this as a saison. It isn't bad, but certainly isn't going to blow you away either - even looking at it as a sour. Good to have tried it, but I won't go out of my way to find this again.","portia99","Jul 19, 2011"

3.97,-0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to Thirstybird for opening this one up. 750ml bottle served in a Bells tulip. Pours a hazy burnt orange with no head, just a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose is pretty fantastic - lots of tropical fruit character, a tartness, cork and medicinal phenols as the brew warms. It actually reminds me a bit of Duck Duck Gooze in some ways. Taste is tart, citrusy, salty and a bit medicinal. These qualities really overwhelm any suggestion of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly, overly assertive carbonation, acidic and astringent. Overall - if you're expecting a Saison, you aren't going to get any of the classic qualities here. In my opinion, it's closer to an American Wild. It's definitely an interesting brew, but not something I would seek out again. All and all, less sour and tart than medicinal.","Jwale73","Jul 16, 2011"

4.1,2.8,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The flavor is decidedly more tart than the aroma suggested, but the guava again saves the day with a fruity, juicy balance. Hints of acetone in the finish amplified by a spritzy carbonation level. Body is somewhat thin and, again, the bubbles are massive and numerous--a bit too soda-like for me. Still, a very tasty, very unique beer and a great summer beer despite the 8% ABV. Cigar City has a winner with Guava Grove.","wagenvolks","Jul 10, 2011"
4,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"O: I read another review here that, if I recall correctly, stated very strongly that this really disappointed the reviewer as a potential summer beer but I have to say I really disagree. This is just the sort of thing I would pop open on my lawn chair on a hot summer day (assuming it's served quite cold). Another nice thing about this beer is that I didn't see a big flavor transition as it warmed up so I feel like you can pretty guiltlessly drink this ice cold.

Much more sour than I remember this being on tap. slightly fruity, but the sourness is what really comes through here. Less of a saison than it is a sour beer. Dry as well. Not so much reminiscent of wilds as it is flemish sours. Lively and very carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, this is a strange beer and I don't quite know how to rate it.

Aromas are astringent, and robust with pepper and coriander spices, a little booze, some citrus sweetness and tangy guava. Body is slick and slightly oily, but with a decent lacing. Flavor is straightforward and tangy fruit sweetness, with orange and peach, ending on the guava again, with a boozey balance.

Earthy aroma, full of fresh fruit and spice, and a bit of funk. The taste follows the aroma more or less, yeasty, with obvious fruit in the foreground--guava mainly, with peach and apricot also noticeable. Very earthy with spicy tones of cloves and very light cinnamon, and a bit of barnyard funk.

Poured a hazy yellow orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, fruit, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonaton. Overall this was an excellent brew. I had this a long time back via a growler and absolutely loved it. Not a lot has changed since this... This is a great brew and the sour/tart aspect really shines through on this one with flying colors. I would never have guessed this was a Saison if I didn't already know. Really glad I to try this one again. Get this one on your palate, you won't regret it!","thagr81us","May 23, 2011"

Yeah, so, I'm not the most familiar with the guava taste, but now I feel like I have a pretty good idea. Very interesting flavor combination. The guava and yeast play a great game, impossible to decide a winner. A little sour, a little sweet, guava fruity. There's a bit of funk in there as well and it finishes surprisingly dry for the initial flavor. Unique has been said before, and it will be said again. Digg it.","dragonWhale","May 21, 2011"

The acetic acidity is a bit out of place, even though it is relatively soft; actually a lactic tartness would have worked really nice here (and would have been more in line with the other Saison notes). This beer is certainly enjoyable, but the acetic and the viscous body make this a bit of a departure from the type of Saisons that I usually prefer (dry, some times lactic tart); the viscous character must be coming from the Guava (or some wild bug). The label is certainly correct in that this beer has some unique flavors to it.","Gueuzedude","Mar 26, 2011"

First quality noted in the sip is the somewhat strong tart, sour and funky acidic quality, the guava is still the star but the presentation here has me questioning saison as the label states. While not as strong as say a Cascade sour, still a balance of sweet, pulpy and watery fruit and a funky tart and sourness star and overshadow much of the rest of the beer - but i want to stress all this is said in a good way.

It pours a cloudy earthy amber topped by over a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises tart blood orange (the smell set off some of my taste buds), lemon, grapefruit, and a mild helping of Brett. The taste holds notes of lemon, mandarin oranges, a vague tropical fruit that we all agree must be the guava (I've never had one, so I don't know what it necessarily tastes like); then a wave of brine and vinegar; and then nothing: The flavors just die away, leaving my tongue wondering what the hell just happened. The body is a light medium, with an active carbonation and an incredibly dry finish. Overall, what could have been a really nice experimental brew turned out to be a slight miss. The saltiness near the end, the disappearance of any and all flavor at the end, and the overt carbonation all turned me off. I'm not a fan here.","TMoney2591","Jan 16, 2011"

Though if I didn't know it was guava I probably wouldn't have guessed it seeing as I don't have much experience with the fruit in my life. There is some lemon and funk to go along with it. Has the smell of older applewine. The taste is a spicy fun light tart flavor. I think it's a rather pleasant sour when you are prepared for it due to the tartness only being involved with fruit flavors.

Malt and yeast clutch each other with a nutty, earthy, lovely mess. Alcohol warmth in the back slowly grows in the dry finish. Some controlled chaos that grew on us.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 11, 2011"

Flavor is dominated by lightly tart guava and other tropical fruit. Lightly bitter finish that is a bit too truncated. Medium-bodied with higher carbonation, a slightly sweet finish and not much alcohol warming. Very drinkable stuff though it's not particularly complex.

Retention is on the short side but there is a nice amount of lacing left on the glass. really has a burnt orange color. The aroma is very tart, almost like a sour in a way or a berliner weisse. has an acidic quality that leaves off being borderline nailpolish remover in its esthers. The flavor is bitter grapefruit pith, lemon peel and some bitter orange juice. refreshing nonetheless and probably perfect with seafood dishes but its not really too classic to the style in this sense. I get the guave a little bit, but nothing significant enough to detract from the harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, dry finish and a lingering acidity. Overall this is pretty good. Flavors arent classic saison flavors for me, but its got the backbone of a saison with the acidity of a berliner weisse. highly drinkable given the high abv. cheers!","Augustiner719","Oct 27, 2010"
5,25.3,5,5,5,5,5,"D: Cigar City has hit the mark with this one. It reminds me more of a guava lambic than a fruited saison.

A bright white cap disappears into just a thin line on top of the beer. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Great looking beer. The aroma if fairly heavy on the guava. Light pear with just a hint of ripe berries. Quite a bit of spice including some fresh ground pepper and clove. Just a mild bitterness to the very end of the aroma. The flavor profile is a bit similar. Guava up front. Fresh ripe berries and just a bit of pear. Quite a bit of spice. There is a odd bitterness that lingers on the palate. It kind of inundates the the whole mouth. Also just a hint of sourness. I dont know if its intended or a by product of the brewing. Just not a huge fan of the flavor profile of this beer. The mouthfeel is spot on for a Saison. Nice and dry, fairly yeasty. Spot on.

The guava truly stands out, with bready malts, sour citrus, and clove/banana notes. Smooth body with low carbonation and a sour aftertaste. Due to my inexperience with this style, and the funk inherent in the style, it took awhile to finish the bottle, but it wasn't too hard to polish off.

The nose is screaming with guava and other tropical fruit such as orange, pineapple, mango and lemon. More guava from the taste, with slight funk and sourness, finishing on a dry champagne note. Having had this before out of the bottle, this one comes off more sour right from the tap into the swing top bottle I received. Mouthfeel is medium bodied on the palate, coming off sweet and juicy, yet sour in many places. The alcohol can barely be felt on this brew, but the flavors make it so appealing that it should be sipped for a while. If I had this one available to me around here, I would be partaking on a regular basis. This is one of the best creations from Cigar City in my opinion.

Plenty of sediment left in the glass as well despite a careful pour. Aroma is fruity and mildy...wild? Also a slight solvent pinch in the finish. Not really picking out any particular fruit in the nose, other than sweet, juicy citrus in general. Flavor thankfully delivers on the guava right up front along with some tangy tangerine but has a fairly weak traditional saison presence (yeast, spice, mouthfeel, earthiness, etc). Mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth with light carbonation, almost syrupy. Finish is drying, with a lingering citrus rind and seed flavor.

Very fruity and yeasty, slightly funky flavored like a little hay and straw. Guava is surly there. Prolongued kinda fruity sour aftertaste but not bad. Good mouthfeel, its a dry and sour aftertaste, the beer itself is a little flat and stale in your mouth but somehow works for the flavors.

4.58,14.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Cheese pairing note: I tried this with a Bucheron, and it wasn't very successful. The beer's acidity seemed to diminish in the presence of the acidic goat cheese. This cheese needs a beer with more acidity.","Beerzebub","May 25, 2010"
4.13,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"F: Still pretty dry, more lingering barnyard funk with malty saison flavors lingering, quite spicy with a touch of alcohol burn. A touch of the tropical fruit also sticks around with some flemmy feel and taste. A touch of tangy sour fruit lingers late too.","jlindros","May 15, 2010"
3.43,-14,4.5,4,3,4,3,"Guava Grove saison is my first beer from Cigar City Brewing, and I definitely see some potential. Enough that I will check out another offering or two if I get the chance. I love the sourness and the fruit, but the off-tasting metallic finish is bad. Guava Grove is half a great beer, and half a bad one. I find myself looking forward to another sip, but also slightly regretting it as it goes down.","Hojaminbag","May 04, 2010"
3.63,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Hazy peach color with a large white head which lasted the entire glass. Pleasant aroma of tropical fruit, some grassiness, and a touch of hops on the back end of the nose. Taste follows suit. There's a nice tartness to the guava, but also gives off flavors of peach and orange. Base saison is well-made, with decent dry, yeastiness on the finish. Carbonation is overbearing at first, needed a lot of swirling of the glass. A good tasting saison, and I had no trouble drinking even though saisons aren't my favorite style.","KeefD","May 02, 2010"

3.27,-18,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Pretty good beer, but for a brewery that has pumped out fanstastic beer after marvelous beer, it's a let down. A standard saison.","maximum12","Apr 07, 2010"
4.07,2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This poured a slightly hazy gold with moderate white head. It smelled like white grapes and guava and sweet honey and grapefruit and wild Belgian yeast, with some tart green apple and a bit of mango or papaya. It tasted like tart guava and wild Belgian yeast and sour apple, with some honey and candi sugar. It was thin with lots of carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice complex scent, with a clean and sour flavor. The guava added an interesting element that complemented the sour taste well. However, the body was too fizzy for me, and made it more difficult to savor the taste. This was otherwise a nice sipping beer, with well hidden alcohol, well balanced, and generally quite enjoyable.","Pencible","Mar 26, 2010"

4.77,19.5,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Head is pillowy and fluffy and slowly vanishes after hanging around just long enough to show off. Lacing is soapy and lovely. Aroma is pungent, funky sour, some citrus (guava I assume) and some spiciness. Taste is sour, a touch sweet, fruity and just delicious. No way this is 8%. NO way. Wow.","KickbacksSteve","Nov 06, 2009"
4.57,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"What a blend of saison and fruit lambic! A dark gold color with a hefty white head. Smells of tropical fruit, especially guava, mixed in with banana and a soft belgian yeast. Taste has a light funk to it which only adds to the fruit taste. Very soft feel to it with a sweet finish. I'll definitely have to drink this one again.","ryrust5301","Oct 29, 2009"
4.27,7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This one's pretty damn contemplative. Opened it very cold, but it's getting its legs quickly. Guava or no guava, this is a solid new world Saison (not exceptionally hopped, but hops do emerge after a bit of warmth). Just a little brighter, deeper and spritelier than the average bear. I am savoring the living hell out of this.","IBUnit63","Oct 20, 2009"

4.2,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty orangey color ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention and some super good lacing. Aroma of light Brett with some fruity ester and some spicy yeast is very interesting and quite complex. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some Brett with light sour notes and some fruity ester that are well mix with a spicy yeast finish. Body is full with limited filtration and perfect carbonation with no appearance of alcohol. Very well and I must say that I am very impressed by this new brewer.","Phyl21ca","Oct 08, 2009"

I had it about three weeks ago for the first time and liked it, and this full bottle has not only confirmed my opinion, but improved it. This is a very complex and very interesting beer. The color is a little off, but who gives a shit? And this is not a clone of your dupont or fantome, but its a very nice and very unique take on the style. I am excited to have a bottle of this to cellar, as i think it will develop well for a little while. Excellent beer, and a great addition to cigar city's lineup. Highly reccomended.","AKBelgianBeast","Sep 15, 2009"

4.12,3.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Ultra-cloudy turbid blond body, looks like homebrew after a couple days in primary. I don't think I've ever seen a murkier beer. The head is dense, white and long-lasting, its only real saving grace. The nose is tart, musty, yeasty and fruity. Spicy with a subtle but plainly noticeable guava presence. Subtle but nice, these Cigar City beers aren't exactly olfactory delights. Tart and fruity on the tongue, lots of guava flavor and lots of yeast. Very dry and sharp with a ton of carbonation. Sour fruit juice mid-palate leading to a lightly bitter, peppery finish. Simple but very enjoyable.","largadeer","Sep 13, 2009"

I never would have tried to trade for anything "guava".. that said, this was not a bad "guava" beer, yet a sorta only okay saison... again.... in IMHO, CCBC has too much going on... I would certainly buy this again as it stands if I had it available, but probably only a bottle or two..","JohnGalt1","Sep 08, 2009"

4.39,10,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"D - This is definitely on the acidic side for a Saison, and may not appeal to some, but it is refreshing and complex. The guava notes could just as easily come from the yeast as any fruit used in fermentation, but they are definitely there. A very good and drinkable beer, even considering the price and scarcity of this beer I would be inclined to seek it out again.","nickfl","Aug 16, 2009"
3.69,-7.5,4.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"This is an interesting beer, i like the acidity a lot. I think it might have some kind of bug, Brett, or otherwise, but that might just be the guava adding a bit of sour , either way its good. Its fairly simple though, nothing too complex, Its a nice beer, very refreshing, easy to drink but not worth the price i think. If it was in a 4 pack for about 9 to 10 bucks i would buy a lot of it, but a 12 buck 750, is a bit much.","redneckchugger","Aug 16, 2009"

Taste is spot on for this style, nice refreshing blast of fruit with hints of pear, banana, pine and guava. Alcohol not detected in the taste but as it warms is detected in the nose. Overall a good offering from Cigar City Brewing and one that I would drink again.","gunnerman","Jul 19, 2009"
