I admit im not a big fan of saisons/farmhouse ales, but i found Brooklyn Sorachi Ace and Ommegang Hennepin to be a lot better. I think its the yeast strain in this that turned me off a bit. Victory is normally excellent, but this is probably my least favorite beer iv had from them and most likely wont return.","Bone53","Feb 28, 2015"

As it warms from the 30'sF it gets much funkier. I am very impressed and would certainly buy several more bombers of this for the price point of $4.99.

Intensely tart lemon and hay flavors mixed with some pepper and layers of base malts. Brett is there in full force. Really enjoying this one. Surprised how well this evolved considering it was over two years past the enjoy by date. Wish I didn't lose half the bottle, but I should have known it may be a gusher.","Bonis","Oct 22, 2014"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste shows the good yeast/hop relationship again in the flavor...I really like the aggressive hop flavor with the lightly tart, fruity yeast. Malts still could use a defter touch I think and just let the yeast and hops do their thing, but as it is, they add a little sweetness that is not altogether unpleasant. This is one of the better American made saisons, very good brew.","twiggamortis420","Oct 20, 2014"

Perhaps one of the best value buys out there. If you're new to Brett, go to school with this beer. It certainly isn't the epitome of the style, but it's simple, pleasant,easily crushable, and a good introduction to the world of brettanomyces. It is worth noting that this bottle kicked around for a year or two. Brett tends to dry out and funk up a beer with time, so this may be quite a different experience when fresh.","ryan1788a5","Jul 17, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy deep golden amber color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big perfumy lemon peel, orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, black pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon peel, orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, clove, black pepper, herbal, grass, floral, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, light fruits, wheat, pepper, clove, grass, herbal, bread, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent saison style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had all the qualitys that I look for in this style with some nice complexity while being very crisp and refreshing. This beer had good drinkability. it went down pretty smooth, was refreshing, and the flavors held my attention, I could see this being a great choice on a hot summer afternoon, I think a bomber would be the perfect amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, the brett gave it the earthy and slightly funky aspect that really tied everything together and doesn't overpower the beer as can happen easily. What I liked the least about this beer was that comes in bomber, this is the perfect candidate for 12oz bottles, a six pack would be great to have during those hot summer days. I would buy this beer again, but I'll probably wait till the summer to revisit it, it wasn't too expensive and it was a good example of the style, I recommend giving it a try and it might make for a good and easy introduction to brett beers. All in all this beer delivered just what I wanted from this style and I thought it was a very solid Saison. So far this is the best beer I have had from Victory and it's up there as one of the better Saisons I have tried, good job guys. I'll have to try a couple more of your beers.","StoutHunter","Nov 23, 2012"

The aroma is moderately peppery, slightly spicy and citrusy, and some earthiness (almost cilantro-like). The flavor is rather peppery and spicy up front with a dry, wine-like finish with a medium-low hop bitterness. Simple, yet complex and interesting if that makes any sense. The carbonation is medium-high and body moderate. Overall a well made, tasty brew, worth a try.","uwmgdman","Jul 13, 2012"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep yellow with a hint of amber and near perfect clarity. Poured with a big frosty white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Lemon and orange zest aromas, funky,earthy yeasty aroma with a hint of spice and hints of biscuity malt. Medium bodied with smooth but aggressive carbonation. Funky yeast flavor from the start with a hint of spice into the middle. Lemon and orange flavors from the middle transition to biscuit malt and once again the funky yeast at the end. Finshes with a lingering yeasty funt aftertaste. This is a fairly subdued saison, but very enjoyable and easy to drink. Personally I enjoy saisons, but find drinking several to be difficult. The funkiness tends to wear down my tastebuds. But the Yards saison was very drinkable.","IronLover","Jul 12, 2012"

I'm pouring it into a frozen pint glass nice and carefully and I'm getting a lot of head and about 1.5 inches of beer which subsides but leaves a nice fine thin head that persists throughout the whole experience. I see all these comments on lacing and yeah it's got it but who cares so lets get onto the smell. I saw another poster and they were getting hints of band aid. I think that's on the mark and may be a product of this type of yeast. Yeah it's there but don't let that turn you off it's band aid good in a way the smell of gasoline or a new shower curtain is good, am I right? I'm not a fan of the style in general but its better than just drinkable. I just tasted a dash of white pepper and there isn't any in here. There is nothing earthy here, all sky from the big bubbles on the palate to the lemons in the tree with more Meyer sweetness than Eureka sourness. Overall I enjoyed this one even the taste of the belches afterward. I suppose I'll have to get more schooled in this style but I'd grab another one of these especially since the price is so right.

I am glad for the experiment, and the enhanced brett qualities are very enjoyable. If you like dry brett-influenced flavors (think aged Orval), stick one of these in your cellar for a few years, just let it warm up a bit and swirl out some of the excessive carbonation before making a final judgement.","allforbetterbeer","Dec 09, 2011"

I sniffed it for quite awhile before taking the first sip, great aroma. The flavor was pretty good as well, heavy brett yeast flavor and a distinct citrus flavor.

Aromas are light and effervescent, with a strong sour component, some light clove spicing, a roast character, and some tart fruit highlights. Flavors are syrupy sweet initially, with a clove spicing joined by ginger and cinnamon. There is a roasted background, with some honey flavors, and an almost mead quality, as well.

Flavor has a carbonation tingle right upfront but transitions to yeasty bubblegum. Some of the lemon curls up for the finish but I am predominantly getting bubblegum through.

Very lively carbonation in fact I turned my back for a second just after I cracked the bottle and I had foam coming up the bottle and running down the sides. Assertive Brett aromas up front with a bit of tart lemon and a little spicy note, almost like grains of paradise. I find the Brett pretty dominant on the palate on this one, not bad for me since I like Brett, but its a bit more domineering than I want in a summer Saison. Carbonation is very high in fact tied with the fact that it foamed over on me when I opened, it leads me to believe the Brettanomyces got a little out of control on this one. Still, I am able to enjoy this beer as it offers a fair amount of complexity.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 14, 2011"

A big cap of white foam dissipated quickly. The nose contains some apple and yeast with cracker malt underneath. Nimble on the palate, the flavor begins with a touch of Belgian fruitiness but is taken over by lemon tinged sourness. The apple the yeast and the lemon combine to create a thirst quenching experience before the end drops out. A good summer ale and respectable attempt at the Belgian inspired ale.","BeardedBoffin","Jul 09, 2011"

It pours a very hazy straw color with a huge head that quickly settles down to something more manageable. Aroma is good, a bit of ripe fruit, funkiness, and yeastiness. The taste is very good as far as my tastes on saisons go, the fruitiness, funkiness, and just a hint of hops keep the yeast in check. It's just a deliicous sour. The mouthfeel is crisp and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is very good for the ABV. Overall, this is a great saison!

I get grapes and plums, with a touch of barnyard floating around as well. The taste is quite fruity as well, but with some definite funk- which is a pleasant surprise. Notes of ripe, soft cheese and a touch of barnyard complement the peach and cherry notes. A little bit tart in the mouth, and on the softer side. A bit different than I was expecting, more of a farmhouse ale take on the style. Quite nice.","Georgiabeer","0"

It has a smooth pale malt flavor; easy drinking, a solid base. The hops provide adequate bitterness and the yeast rounds out the palate with lots of earthy farmhouse funk. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average saison. It's flavorful and true to style, although the appearance seems off.

The smell is yeasty and has that bottle aged Belgium smell that stings your nose. The flavor is similar to wheat beer, but this is super crisp and fruity. The down side is that it has the mucky aftertaste that I don't love about wheat beer. Previously I haven't noticed beer tasting like lemongrass, but this beer really does have that lemon/herbal grassiness. The body is really light, even at a 7.5% ABV. This is something that I could have a few of easily. When super cold, this is refreshing goodness.

Some of the spice seems to be amplified by the yeast and alcohol is adding to the dry quality of malt and yeast in the brew. I like how it is refreshing with good flavor from the yeast and has some hop bitterness. The saison is very traditional in taste -true to the standard Dupont which is good, drinkability is ok, but I prefer a little more malt.

Pretty much no lacing left on the glass. Aroma is pears, lemon peel, peppery spice and some grassy hops. I can taste peppery spice, lemon peel, grassy hops, and some pale malt. Also, there's a bitter/sour flavor that kinda reminds me of sourdough bread. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit crisp and has good carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough.

Some alcohol flows in and while evident is quite well integrated. Nice hop blend adds the requisite balance without taking away the spotlight on the malt. Feel is kinda full and creamy with an excellent carbonation. Drinkability just makes the 4 as I usually find saisons to be a bit more quenching and lighter.

The clove and citrus qualities come out as well, along with a cheesy, aged hop taste. I wish that the beer were more spritzy, though...although carbonated, it's a bit too still.

As time wears on though it seems to not maintain the interest, it loses a bit of complexity perhaps, or more appropriately, I think it needed a bit more fermentation complexity. It seems to need a bit more yeast derived spiciness and bite. I think that the grain character, which is nice by the way, becomes a bit too dominant in the end.

A solid saison with pretty much everything you'd expect from the style, meaning a light orangy color, nice funky farmhouse nose (not too strong though), and then a generally light and drinkable wheaty-citrus-lightly sour flavor. A tasty brew for a phenomenal price. Will be getting it again.","soupyman10","Aug 21, 2010"

The nose comprises mandarin oranges, peach, grapefruit, and a light kiss of a caramel. The taste is nearly identical, with some additional mild floral bitters. The body is a heavy light, with an active carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very tasty brew, possibly my favorite regularly-available saison.","TMoney2591","Aug 10, 2010"

3.1,-19.1,4,4,2.5,3,3,"Out of a bomber this beer was a hazy, golden color with lots and lots of rising carbonation. This translated to a very vigorous head of yellow-tinted foam that was a good three fingers thick and refused to yield over time. The aroma was of crystal malt, pale malt, Belgian yeast, some mustiness, semi-sweet citrus peel and floral hops. The flavors were ...weird?! A blend of citrus peel, spicy hops, musty malt, black pepper, earthy yeast and a very herbal, very bitter finish. All these strong elements might have been desirable if they complimented one another but sadly they seemed to compete. It smelled very farmhouse but tasted very outhouse. Ouch! The mouthfeel was foamy, the body medium and the carbonation medium/high. The off notes I detected and amount of frothy head I saw leads me to believe that this beer was mishandled. I'd like to add as a caveat thusly that one's experience with this beer might likely be better than the bomber I tried.","thekevlarkid","Jul 19, 2010"

It smells very good, especially for an American Saison, and avoids being too malt-forward and sweet by simply going 180 degrees in the opposite direction. The high (for the style) levels of grapefruit bitterness and what I suspect is bottle conditioning gone weird are the only things holding this back from being a superior American Saison. Recommended, especially if you can get a new batch and drink them a few months apart. I'll surely try it again.","kkipple","Jul 01, 2010"

Murky yellow straw color, strong effulgence, a few beads visible here and there. Rye, wheat bread and white grapefruit to lemon citrus bloom biggest in the nose, soft and generously spread throughout clove and pepper spice, noticeable presence in the apricot, peach, pear scents, the slightest hint of cocoa beans. Close to full-bodied, the carbonation has an aggressive, if fluffy, churn. Friendly orange, white grapefruit citrus and that apricot, peach, persimmon fruit make for a sweet mouth entry, you get the mocha before the wheat, rye, pumpernickel bread. Some moderate grassiness.

There is pear and apricot, with clove and allspice and rosemary. Herby hops coat the tongue and give it a powerful but not overwhelming bitterness on the finish.

As the head dissipates it leaves slight lacing on the glass. Sweet malt and light fruity aromas dominate the nose. A biscuity yeast scent lingers with notes of cherry and lemon. Helios is again hits the mark in the farmhouse style with a crisp mouthfeel and medium body. The taste is malt-forward with a great ginger character and a rush of spice in the finish. Mild hop bitterness. The 7.5% ABV is hidden well which aids in superb drinkability. The label states that Victory was going for a specifically Belgian style, but it could use some improvement in the hop profile and choice of yeast before it's close to its Belgian forefathers. Overall, a great summer beer that I'll come back to.","turnstile","Jun 14, 2010"

Brett is a little musty but mostly barnyard. Taste is similar as the nose with a noticeable funk. Feels light and refreshing with some alcohol warmth.

There are lots of bananas in the aroma, with notes of lemon and phenol. It smells fruity and funky. It has a lively, medium body that starts a little heavy on the tongue and becomes very light at the squeaky dry finish. It has a very phenolic flavor overall. There is a little herbal bitterness and something earthy in there, but it's hard to notice-- Everything is overpowered by the taste of Band-Aids. A long Band-Aid finish lingers. Yech.

The palate is just as excellent, opening with a big, Brett character, just a fantastic, grass notes, blended very well with a light hop character, mildly German in nature, particularly on the finish.

The aroma has a nice mix of grass, lemon and pepper. Also maybe some green fruit? Somewhat sweet aroma as well. The flavor is nice, the grassy flavor comes to mind at first but then seems to break away to a slightly sweet lemon citrus flavor. Pepper flavor is there and adds a nice little prickle with the hop presence. Drinks quite easily and is a surprise that this one weighs in at 7.5%. Overall I would say that this brew is very good based on the flavor coupled with the price of this bomber (3.99).

The saison has an aggressive hop flavor which seems out of place for a saison. It kinds of gives the taste an asprin like characteristic. The rest of the flavors are spot on to the style. Nice horse blanket, hay, pepper, tart lemon and green apple. The feel is light and crisp, with fizzy carbonation, perhaps a touch overcarbonated. The finish isn't all that great with the asprin like bitterness. Overall, a decent saison. It has some nice flavors but the bitter asprin like characteristics kills this brew for me.

Head eventually settles into a thin cap, leaving some residual strands of lacing as the brew recedes. Light nose - lemon zest, orange peel and belgian yeast. Taste consistent with nose; however, some tartness comes out towards the middle, a little bitterness follows (maybe lemon rind) and lingers between quaffs; belgian yeast evident in the nose is pretty much masked. Mouthfeel is light and lively with some astringency coming out towards the back. Fairly decent farmhouse; however, lots of acidity and tartness. Closer to a Belgian Strong Pale/Farmhouse hybrid in my opinion. Worth a try if you like cleaner examples of the style.","Jwale73","Feb 03, 2010"

The range of aromas you find in saisons makes it difficult to rate to style, so I'll rate to my own tastes. Some lemongrass, floral hops (not citrus, more herbal), a little estery fruit in the background. The taste is a little sweet upfront, no real funk which is a shame, a little peppery aftertaste.

3.72,-2.9,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Listen, for under $4 it's good to have around. Good, standard quality - nothing really groundbreaking here but it works for those Belgio-philes on a budget.","IBUnit63","Sep 25, 2009"
3.93,2.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D- Split the bomber, but could of took it to the head. The 7.5% is a bit high for a saison, and the alcohol shows it's head only a bit during the experience. If I could cook, i would of made a dish to pair this with as that would have made this even tastier. On it's own, Helio's rock's, even if it's not a "new beer".","BARFLYB","Sep 24, 2009"
4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall this was a very, very solid offering here. I though the ABV was remarkably well hidden and it went down smooth and easy. I would have no issue at all with having this one again any day.","mikesgroove","Sep 22, 2009"
4.25,11,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Around $3-$4 a bottle for this? Are you kidding me? This will now be the best / most readily available / most affordable domestic Saison. I challenge you to let me know where I can find another with those attributes this good, especially one that tastes like an import. Bravo Victory for keeping the goodness if V Saison alive. I'll be buying a lot more of this.","asabreed","Sep 19, 2009"

3.68,-3.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"22 oz bomber purchased from Total Wine and More in West Orange... Great pour and appearance... Golden and hazy, true-to-the-style with a fluffy, thick, white head and visible carbonation... Raw, dusty, earthy aroma with faint hints of lemon and slight lime which were also present in the flavor... The overall taste lacked the bite and spritz of European Saisons but this was nonetheless a good American rendition...","dsa7783","Sep 09, 2009"
4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Hazy light gold/straw color with a steady stream of carbonation that supports a fluffy white head and splotches of lacing. Aroma is very fresh and mildy funky. Noble hops, grassy, pepper, citrus and slight alcohol presence. Medium bodied, mildly syrup like, effervescent carbonation. Sweet and funky flavor, balance of citrus (lemon) and earthy grass, yeast with some spice (pepper and clove) and mild caramel malt. Very nice, easy drinking saison, at the price and availability this will become a goto beer.","yourefragile","Sep 08, 2009"
3.4,-11.2,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Very carbonated up front with a creamy, medium body. Lots of earthy notes, hop bitterness, light crisp fruit, citrus peel, lemon zest, spicy pepper and strong alcohol astringency. Slightly dry finish.","corby112","Sep 07, 2009"

4.3,12.3,5,5,4,4,4,"It has a huge head that clings to the sides of the glass. The color is a cloudy golden. The aroma is of grapefruit, hay, and bread. The flavors really meld and taste "farmy". They don't call this a farmhouse-style Belgian for nothing. Lots of earthy flavors with hay, grass, pine, and autumn spices. Black pepper kicks in mid tongue. Under it and through the finish is grapefruit. It's really a unique combination. I don't think I've had a brew that tasted like this. It could be off putting or delicious depending on your tastes. I like it but I would definitely limit it to an occasional purchase.","skinny0ne","Sep 05, 2009"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D - Fine version of a saison with plenty of spicy and funky character. I found this to be quite drinkable while still maintaining a fairly complex flavor overall.","ffejherb","Sep 03, 2009"
3.95,3.1,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability is great a beer you'll have no problems with, share with friends don't be stingy. In fact this style of beer when done right has potential to convert most friends especially women to the craft beer movement. I was at Victory's last tenth anniversary party and I hope I'm able to have a blast at the next one. Oh yeah, Victory is supposedly coming into West Virginia in the not so distant future.","WVbeergeek","Sep 01, 2009"

3.99,4.2,4.5,3,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a glass. Very pleasant apperance, greaterbeing golden glowing color. Very frothy head, many many spirling bubbles to the top. I hope this beer makes me as happy as the sun on the label. Not a huge fan of the smell. Aromas of hops, pine, and alchol. The taste is complex and exquisite. Medley of flaovrs, grain, yeast, hops, spices, cinnamon, and a hoppy piney aftertaste. The mouthfeel is quite crisp and refreshing. The taste stays in your mouth until the next sip replenishes the flavor. I find this beer quite drinkable even with the high alchol content. Good price too, got a 1pint 6oz bottle for 4 bucks.","FrothyBeverage","Aug 23, 2009"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear pale orange with about two fingers of rocky white head. Aroma has lots of fruit, namely citrus but a good dose of apple and pear as well. There is also a nice yeatyness that lurks in the background. Taste is pretty good, complex. The beer is a bit sour and tart at first. This gives way to a yeasty and fruity complexity. Moderate hop bitterness gets lost with all of the more dominant fruity esters and spicy phenols. Mouthfeel is good with medium-light body and high carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. This isn't exactly like other saisons that I've tried but it is enjoyable nonetheless.","mnj21655","Aug 20, 2009"

4.33,13.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Relative to Saison Dupont, Hennepin, etc., this doesn't really compare in the same style, I don't think. It's a bit too fruity for that. However, don't let that stop you from stashing a few away before Victory runs out for the season. A good value for the $$, too.","gfreed","Beers"
