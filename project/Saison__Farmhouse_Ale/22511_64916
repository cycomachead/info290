4.63,6.4,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Poured into a tasting glass, Anna is glassine golden straw with a robust, rock-and-cream head and a central column of effervescence. The bouquet erupts from the glass, dominated by green apple, wet grass and honey. The taste opens with a mix of tartness and earth, but this gives way to a biscuit and spice finish. If there’s one adjective for Anna, it’s dewy. This is a sweet, pastoral ale, mixing citrus, bread, honey, apple and hints of ginger, brown sugar and pepper. Anna is full and zesty but also refreshing. This is a product that showcases the liquid component as strongly as its malt, hops and adjuncts. It’s just so damn drinkable, you have to stop yourself from swilling it down.","TheCuriograph","Mar 03, 2015"

But being a Hill Farmstead product I was excited(but not optimistic) to give  Anna a try.  This beer breaks the mold for Honey brewed beers. The mouth feel was soft not slimey, the flavor was incredible. You could taste the wildflower honey but the uniquely sour flavor brought balance and complexity. The weak link in this brew, if you can call it that is the slight sour milk aroma, but that is nitpicking. This beer was probably the best beer I consumed in 2014, and probably top 10 all time.

The flavor as a nice direction of honey, lemons and tea with some peppery taste. It's very light, sprite and bubbly on the tongue with a finish of Apple and pear.

Taste is fruity and tart, lemon and citrus fruit, dry with grassy flavours and a bit of dill also, the slightest suggestion of honey, funky with just a slight sourness to it. Dry spritzy carbonation, medium bodied. Solid stuff as was expected, however I think I enjoyed Arthur more but would certainly entertain this again wiothout question.","peensteen","May 11, 2014"

Taste is very nice, floral up front like Clara, juicy bright fruits as the well carbonated finish brings in the sweet honey balance. Very tight and balanced, nice dusty quality mid palate from the Saison yeast with an interesting sweetness of honey in the finish.","cpetrone84","Feb 04, 2014"

This bright and aromatic saison is fermented with their strain of exceptional yeast for a total sensory experience that's dangerously drinkable and quick to disappear.

Some nice floral hops, citrus hops, and sweet honey throughout and easy to drink, certainly worth getting. Would love to have it again.","mdfb79","Feb 07, 2013"

4.08,-6.2,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"kind of a funky beer, jazzy and different from the legions of mediocre saisons out there. the fact that this was in colorado, even by trade, had me very excited. arguably the best thing new england does at all is hill farmstead, in my humble opinion. the pour is a really hazy muted yellowy color, creamy white head several inches high continues to rise. the nose is obviously sweet, a honey focused brew no doubt, but the low key spice and cirtus qualities of the yeast are evident as an equalizer, and this is promising to be delicious. its an assault of flavor, coating the entire palate, polleny springtime honey is prominent, but there isnt that much residual sugar. the yeast is also just behind center stage, more peppery funk than i thought from the nose, but it does cut right through some of that sugar. there is lemon juice too, mostly in the finish. there is a very mild hop bitterness (also on the citrusy side), before everything gives way to a sort of off yeasty aftertaste, which is the weakness of this beer for me. its not quite metallic, but it is minerally and bitter and not quite congruent with the rest of the beer. creamy texture though and a nice full round body for a beer this light in color, i really appreciate its expansive properties, and the carbonation is fine, although it may contribute a granular character when combined with the unfiltered yeast. overall a nice take on the saison, im now even more curious to try their others.","StonedTrippin","Jan 14, 2013"

A hint of pepper and spice and a little bit of yeasty funk and a light tart fruitiness provide a really nice contrast. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel.

Two fingers of airy white foam crown the beer and hang around for a minute. A light dusting of lacing remains attached to the glass. The nose is very pleasant, with aromas of lemon zest, straw and a touch of freshly cracked black pepper. I take a sip, and here the malt character is more bready than straw like. Subtle black pepper comes in next and quickly transitions to a finish that features both lemon and a soft fruitiness. The body is well dried out, and the carbonation supremely lively on my palate. Just a superb mouthfeel all around. I haven't always been as impressed with Hill Farmstead's saisons and sours as I have with their porters and hoppy beers, but Anna is a fantastic brew.","axeman9182","Nov 25, 2012"

The nose is full of citrus fruits, an array of spices, dried oatmeal, lemongrass, and bubblegum esque Belgian yeast. A GREAT nose. The flavors feature a floral and citrusy bouquet of deliciousness, more bubblegum yeast, slight hop bitterness, and light funk. It has great and well rounded flavor. The bugle gum and yeast are superb. It drinks light and off dry. It is extremely drinkable and has great appeal all around.

4.17,-4.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to Thirstybird for bringing this back from his VT trip. 750ml bottle served at 51 degrees in my ST tulip. No freshness dating evident. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a rocky three inch bright white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a consistent 1/8th inch head. Some thin spots and swaths of lacing presented during the tasting. Nose is on the clean side but quite pleasant - grassy, sweet, light fruit, citrus, coriander and a trace of medicinal phenols towards the back. Taste expresses many of the qualities present in the nose, but the sweetness is a bit more downplayed - there's more citrus and rind and less coriander, but the medicinal/herbal character seems more interspersed throughout the flavor profile compared with the nose. There's also a slight peppery quality that comes out in the middle. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an assertive, palate cleansing carbonation that falls just short of prickly. Finish is not quite semi-dry, but you definitely get something to that effect at the tail end. All and all, a very pleasant and interesting Saison - perhaps a little too on the clean side, but an excellent beer nonetheless. Well worth your time if you enjoy the style. I'd be curious to see what a little age might do to this one.","Jwale73","Aug 02, 2011"

Medium bodied, soft and delicate on the palate, but doesn't finish as crisp or dry as expected for the style. Flavor is very similar to the other non-BA HF saisons and has a traditional earthy, musty and funky finish.

I mistaked it for Bullfrog Undead Ed because of the scent of brett but this is indeed Anna. Come to think of it Brett rules this one. The brett comes out in taste in full and is not messing around. It reminds me of Flora because the lemon is big as well which plays nice with the brett. Can't really pick up the honey under all of that. As expected the body was light and refreshing other than the brett aftertaste and the carb was spot on, semi tart finish but dry as a bone. I enjoyed this one but did not love it.
