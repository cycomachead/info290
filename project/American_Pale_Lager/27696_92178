Zoe is 5.2% abv, and has a deeply golden color, on the edge of amber. The head is light and small, disappears quickly with a bit of lacing. The aroma was of orange blossoms, fresh and tangy. My first sip also struck a citrusy, slightly sweet but hoppy taste, with a mildly bitter finish that doesn't linger very long - clean and refreshing! Overall - deeelicious!","rorjets","Dec 07, 2014"

Has a hint of apples as well. Malty taste with hints of citrusy tropical fruit up front, quickly followed by a grassy hoppy taste. You can discern that malty lager taste right at the end but only for a split second. Nice bitter aftertaste. I am generally not a fan of lagers, but this one definitely will do. Excellent beer.

I decided to wait a moment or so when some puffy foam began to extrude itself from within the CAN. Oooh, an active beer! When it showed no sign of relenting, I proceeded incautiously, resulting in ~ three fingers of dense, foamy, tawny head with good retention. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9), suggesting that it was unfiltered. Good! Filtration only strips away flavor and I am not a fan. Nose had a nice, malty sweetness unencumbered by adjuncts. One of the unintended CANsequences of The CANQuest (TM) has been the number of AALs that I have had to CANsume, so I know from whence I speak. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was hoppier than the nose had led me to expect! It had a honey-malt flavor intermingled with a minty grassiness and if I had been asked to guess, I might have gone with a Czech Pils. Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. I might enjoy it more on a hot, humid summer's day than on a (literally) freezing cold morning like this one, hence school being closed. YMMV.","woodychandler","Feb 05, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, peach, mango, pineapple, floral, grass, bread, light caramel, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, peach, mango, pineapple, bread, light caramel, floral, grass, and floral/yeast earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, peach, mango, bread, light caramel, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on finish. Very nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with balanced malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice hoppy pale lager style. Nice complexity and balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy sunset auburn-amber topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises light toffee, very light biscuit, mild candied orange peel, and a touch of grassy flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, eliciting thoughts of amber ales and the like. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather fluid feel. Overall, a nice beer; like I said above, it reminds me more of a nice amber ale than anything that calls itself a pale lager these days, but that doesn't hurt its enjoyment any. I could easily see drinking plenty of this as an everyday drinker, were it available 'round these parts.","TMoney2591","Sep 27, 2013"

It pours a golden orange with a bit of hops and fruit on the nose. The taste zips on your tongue with citrusy fruit and apricot flavors and a mild bitterness to give it a nice dry finish. Very crisp and very refreshing. The Zoe is a bountiful beer in a can and a total home run from Hops and Grain.","brurevu","Aug 15, 2013"

It has a tart, crisp character that reminds me of grapefruit, but it isn't a fruity beer, at all. It has wonderful, balanced hop characteristics and a fantastic finish. A perfect beer. I only buy it now for special occaisons because I literally drink it too fast. I can't sip it like many other beers, I open a can, pour it in a glass, blink and its gone.","GibbonsTheBeerGuy","Jun 08, 2013"

Aggressive pour leaves a golden color with a finger of white head that fades fast and leaves a thin white line with little lacing as the glass goes down. I love the smell on this beer, right as a pop the can I get big fresh hop scent from this pale session lager. The taste is much more mild, slightly fruity, maybe a little grapefruite and brown sugar. I can see myself having multiples of this in one sitting. This is a perfect session beer, especially for the hot summertime months we have ahead of us here in Texas. I am very thankful that this is available to me now.","StArnoldFan","Apr 16, 2013"
