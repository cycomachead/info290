Aroma is a potent punch of hops oil, you can almost taste the hops, the aroma is so strong! Underneath the wall of alpha oils,you can detect pear, honey and grapefruit. The taste is appropriately hoppy for the smell; not  buzzsaw of bitterness, but is a well hopped lager, leaning toawrds an IPL. Pale lager malts are mild and add just enough countering sweetness. Sort of a blandly bitter impression, overall.","SamN","Feb 11, 2015"

3.75,7.4,,,,,,"Poured from a bomber (Batch #20) into a big ass mug, the beer is a hazy, bright, straw gold coloring with a filmy, fluffy, bright white head, and a ton of carbonation action throughout the body.  The aromas are toasted grain forward, with a healthy dose of floral hops characteristics, tart lemon notes, and medicinal highlights.  Flavors are bitter and spiced hops forward, with a healthy dose of moss, pepper, and grass.  Lemon rind highlights, floral accents, and a cracker backbone.  Smooth, but light and crisp in mouth.  The aftertaste is tart, resinous, and bitter, with more of the hops spice lingering on.  Crisp, effervesced, dry finish.  Very drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Sep 16, 2014"

Certainly not the most authentic beer, but definitely worth a try if you like hops and are looking for a refreshing, low-alcohol alternative to IPA. Like most light lagers, it is a bit underrated on BA because too many people have hang ups about this style. Just because something is in the same family as a PBR or Bud doesn't mean it's bad!","Spider_Jerusalem","Jul 06, 2014"

Aroma of light sweet biscuit malt and citrus, light generic hops, a bit grainy. Flavor of biscuit malt, light piney and citrus hops, citrus. Starts with nice hops and finishes with citrus and dry malt. Light bodied. The flavor profile is quite similar to a classic pilsner, but with fresher hops.

Spotty soapy lacing on the glass; with a nice amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, grass, floral, cracker, bready grain, and earthy hop spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange zest, floral, grass, cracker, bread, pepper, pine, and herbal hop spiciness. Fair amount of lemony pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, grass, pepper, cracker, bread, pine, and herbal hop spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with good complexity; good hop/malt balance; and almost zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, prickly, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish.

3.33,-4.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"interesting hybrid brew from epic. what struck me first was the greenish tinge when poured into my epic logo pint. frothy white head with larger bubbles rising from the bottom, but it didn't stick around. herbal, almost medicinal aromas wafting out of this one; increased in intensity as the beer warmed up a few degrees. something grassy, too. light body as expected with a dry, dry finish. not as thirst quenching as i would have expected; those american hops really dry this beer out. taste is like a german pilsner that received an extra dose of u.s. hops. i suppose that's what they were going for in this one. certainly ok, but i wouldn't rush out to find another.","dannydetox","Jun 17, 2012"
3.23,-7.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall: This is a very hoppy, bitter lager. Too bitter for the low abv and light malts IMO. Quite simply there is not enough oomph or taste to back up the bitterness. Just as a point of comparison, Victory Prima Pils is also very bitter, but has the necessary taste to make it a world class beer.","bsp77","Jun 16, 2012"

4.03,15.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"No dating on the bottle but the description, the label, and the big greenhop on the label grabbed my attention. Beautiful looking beer it's almost glowing a neon lemon slight haziness but it's bright looking. Glistening white head with thick layers of tiny bubbles filling the top portion of the glass. Aroma has a bright lemon citrus quality, the label says their American hops with American yeast, and German pilsner malt. The smell is great I just keep smelling fresh picked ups with green, herbal, bright lemon citrus, and earthiness jump out of the glass. Flavor has a clean lemon citrus punch that brings with it layers of grassy/herbal quality, dusted with some yeast nuttiness and pale malt sweetness. Becomes a bit hop pellet focused with each sip, but I really can't hate on the hops this is a delicious hoppy lager that is their #5 relase in the Exponential series. This bottle label says 5% abv, which is still right in the sessionable level, 22 ounce bomber for 6 bucks well worth it for my tastes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with slick hop oils lubricating the palate this beer is actually making me salivate from all of the hop additions. Carbonation is dead on not overdone but sturdy enough to carry it all through with each sip. Quite the enjoyable creative hopped up lager, that I wish I had regular access to.","WVbeergeek","Feb 26, 2012"

Dry, slightly skunky, and light bodied, there's not a lot going on here, and what is happening is something I could take or leave. Better to grab a Smoked and Oaked if you're looking for something Epic.","TheHoppiest","Oct 29, 2011"

3.86,10.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O: Overall a crisp offering with its fair share of hops makes for a great summer time drink. The hops overshadow the fine german pilsner malt, but this is an American pale lager not a pilsner so much can be forgiven. Would like to see this in six packs. Very good drinkability.","beerthulhu","Oct 24, 2011"
3.98,14,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall: I think this is a solid beer. The American Pale Lager is a tough category because it is dominated by the big boy on the macro market. Many craft drinkers will hold their noses up as they walk past this one to get something a little stronger. This is a shining example of a beer that can be used to win over craft converts. It tastes familiar enough to them, and yet is still well made with a solid taste.","kagent777","Oct 05, 2011"
3.38,-3.2,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall, a nice lager, though not as big and hoppy as I expected from the name and packaging. I was thinking something along the lines of an imperial pilsner. Not bad, but somewhat overpriced.","RonfromJersey","Sep 24, 2011"

3.33,-4.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured straw-yellow, slightly hazed, with a thin white head that receded to a thin ringlet. Noticeable carbonation. Clean, light aroma, decent balance of sweet malts and citrusy hops. Basic taste of grains and sweet malts, lightly hopped for a good balance and a mostly dry finish. A little bitter. Light body, crisp, and pretty drinkable. Not bad for a lager.","Rifugium","Sep 01, 2011"

4.03,15.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"O- By American Pale Lager standards this is near the top. I would gladly pick this up for tailgating, or as my beer for over the course of a night. It doesn't push the boundaries quite so much as it advertises, but it still tastes good and that's what counts.","jsprain1","Aug 19, 2011"
3.53,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - This particular beer in the Exponential series doesn't do it for me. It's hoppier than the average lager but compared to the other beers I've tried in the Exponential Series from Epic, it seems out of place. Yeah, it's hoppier, but it's only 5.1%, I don't see how this would be classified in the same category as some of their bigger beers...maybe I'm missing something?","jzeilinger","Aug 17, 2011"
3.75,7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,5,4,"O: Once I let this warm up to about 45-50 degrees rather than the colder temperatures lagers are traditionally enjoyed at, the beer became more than just your average pale lager, yet not as hoppy as advertised. So good for the style, but falls short of expectations of a hoppy lager, and probably my least favorite Epic offering as of yet.","stimulus","Jul 29, 2011"
3.85,10.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Excellent for the style. Torn here, as it is a high dollar for an American lager but it is a truly excellent, well made beer and definitely satisfies more than most pale US lagers. A worthwhile buy, even for a style that people generally don't associate with high quality, non-adjunct laden ingredient bills.","EStreet20","Jul 22, 2011"
