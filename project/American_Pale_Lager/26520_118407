Easily my favorite Pale lager to date, which I am following up a few days after having Kiwi Rising also by Jacks Abby.  I will continue to support this brewery for sure.","alpinebryant","Feb 23, 2015"

Pine, orange, lemongrass, melon, mango and papaya  are all present. Light in body with a crisp, cracker-like malt backbone, this beer has moderate carbonation which allows the hop flavor to shine. Supple with a pleasant oiliness, this feels great on the palate. An excellent beer","DefenCorps","Dec 02, 2014"

4.06,0.2,4,4.25,4,4,4,"On tap at New York Pizza. Pours a translucent dark yellow with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of tropical and citrus fruits. Some light malt notes too, but mainly its the fruity hops. The taste is bitter citrus and tropical fruits upfront. Toasted malts with a bitter citrus peel finish.Some floral and grassy notes as well. Lots of carbonation with a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Overall, solid hoppy Lager I'll grab again.","PicoPapa","Jun 25, 2014"

Quite nice, enjoyable, good hop profile, nice light lager base with dry crisp finish that lets the hops stand out, and they don't got overboard. Although, the finish gets a bit too bitter and spicy.","jlindros","Jun 19, 2014"

The taste doesn't quite live up, but it's still very good. Like other beers I've had from them, it's only in the taste that you can tell you're drinking a lager and even then, you can forget. This tastes like a great IPA, with a bit of lagery aftertaste. Body is good and overall, a very solid beer. I'd drink this regularly if it were available.","dougfur","May 29, 2014"

It adds a nice layer of complexity and helps keep this from being a little one-note, even if it's somewhat subdued compared to the spiciness and tropical fruitiness of the citra. Tasty and refreshing. My only real knock is that the citra dominates a little too completely.","Dope","Apr 25, 2014"
