Flavor is very light and thin. Not much going on. Reminds me of another all malt low-cal/low-carb beer that is no longer brewed. For what it is it is OK.","EagleTalon","Aug 12, 2014"

Aromas of toast, floral highlights, and some funky esther. Flavors are tangy and light, with an effervescent character keeping the body crisp. Toasted grain backbone with some buttery highlights. The aftertaste is light, with a toasty character. Frothy, slightly sharp finish.","GarthDanielson","Mar 10, 2013"

This pours a pale straw yellow with a small white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are somewhat sweet and light no real hop presence. The feel is very light.
