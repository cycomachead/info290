Those also taste cleaner with more hop flavor in the finish, and are generally enjoyable to drink.  This one has a rather assertive, artificial generifruit gummy candy or jellybean fruitiness in the finish and no hops to balance things out.  Not particularly dry, and weak in mouthfeel and body.  The first couple sips were ok, but I'm wishing I didn't have 5 more of these to drink.  The carbonation starts out very lively, but gets fairly flat about halfway through, and you're stuck with something akin to a less than great apple cider.  Definitely the worst beer I've had in a while.","UnionMade","Aug 04, 2014"

The look in the glass was all-american lager a.k.a. urine. The nose was very weak malt and bananas. I poured this can into a pint glass so I could get a better look and smell at it (bad idea really - neither characteristic being a strength), and the head took less than a second to dissipate, so I might as well get to the drinking. The taste was good actually, with sweet corn and froot loops being the major notes. The mouthfeel is above average, not overly foamy and pretty smooth. The drinkability is also above average, clocking in at about 15 minutes for "first beer on a friday". Better than the big guys, and cheaper.","g00dness","Sep 14, 2010"

A very light noble hop aroma that combines with the sweetness to make it kind of fruity smelling. Wow. For an adjunct lager it really doesn't taste bad at all!
