I could drink this all night long. Taste was crisp and yummy, a little hops a little malt no corn. straw yellow looking poured into a pint glass. just the right amount of bubbles salt and flavor...light tasting but with just enough charachter to grab me and slap me and drink another! this stuff rocks!!!","wejohnsn","Aug 07, 2014"

It has a strong grassy aroma, underlined with a cooked corn note and vague grainy sweetness. Smells like an adjunct lager with extra hops. The taste, which has the character of said style, does have a vibrant grassy flavor which buries some of those less appealing flavors. Helping it are crisp bubbles, albeit with a slick base. For the money, Session Lager may be one of the better buys out there.","DoubleJ","Feb 23, 2014"

Color was sunshine-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose was grassy, biscuit malty and just as I remembered it. Mouthfeel was medium and the grassiness of the hops reminded me of fresh-mown lawn. Come on, warm weather! It is three days into Spring 2013 and it is colder than some days this past Winter. Grrr. It is a good thing that I have beer. I anxiously await the opportunity to begin mowing my backyard again after laying grass seed last summer. I digress. Man, was this beer going down quickly! I really liked the way the malt got out of the way of the hops until the extreme finish and offset them just enough to be considered semi-dry. Dry should be reserved for American IPAs while lagers should exhibit at least a little sweetness. Welcome to PA, Hood River, OR! I hope that you plan to stick around.","woodychandler","Mar 23, 2013"

The beer is nice looking and smelling, but the flavor kills it's appeal for me greatly. Although I wouldn't turn it down over many others, it's not special.","harrymel","Mar 19, 2012"

Also a slight, slight hint of citrus. The big thing about this beer though is it's smoothness and drinkability. This thing goes down super easy, very refreshing.

This might be the most see through beer I have ever seen. It pours a one and a half finger head that is a hanging around for a bit, which is surprising, giving the appearance of it. Also in the appearance - so much carbonation, wow, OMG! There are so many f-ing bubbles coming up from this thing. I hate to say it, but other than the head, this thing doesn't look too good. The smell is a little better, I don't pick up any corn or anything really offensive like that, it smells like a lager. I mean there really isn't much aroma though, you get a small malty smell, maybe a hint of hops somewhere in there, but not much. It just kinda smells like a generic lager, without the corn and other crap. Ok, well for the taste, it's not too bad. It for sure tastes like a lager, and there really isn't too much going on in the way of taste, but there really isn't anything offensive about it, it's very smooth and easy drinking. I'm torn with the taste really, because it is tasty, and there isn't anything wrong with it, it's just really really not exotic as far as the taste goes. I want to give this a 4 on taste, but I can't bring myself to do that, so 3.5. Mouthfeel is normal for a lager and the drinkability is pretty high, but that is no surprise. I guess overall it's an easy drinking lager, and it is tasty, with nothing wrong with it, but if there was a beer to define the term "nothing special about it" this would be the one.","MaltsOfGlory","Mar 14, 2011"

Mouthfeel is medium with generous carbonation. Overall, very drinkable and sessionable. Compared to a lot of other craft beer it doesn't really impress me.

Very little carbonation and lacing. Nose is slightly more complex and pleasing that the macro lagers but still about the same profile. Sweet and yeasty malted barley with dull bitter hop undertones. Light bodied and flat. Not a lot of flavor but super easy to drink. Mildly sweet with roasted malt and just a touch of hop bitterness to make it very clean on the palate. Roasted malt comes through in the finish. This beer tries to be true to style but I feel like they could have made this a lot better. Still, if you want an authentic American lager to session that is still tasty and inexpensive without supporting the giants, well here you go.

It maintains a tight, bone-white head throughout and leaves decent lacing as I go. Pale malts, nutty lager yeast and a touch of fruitiness in the nose. Similar on the palate, with apple and grape esters, mild bitterness, perhaps some finishing hops and a curiously increasing sweetness that tastes almost corny and leads to a quick finish. Mildly dextrinous body leans toward medium, but is lightened by the tingly carbonation. This is a tasty all-malt lager that is very easy to drink, although a bit of adjuncts would serve this brew well in order to lighten its body and increase its drinkability. A solid brew nonetheless, and it makes me wish there were more tasty craft-brewed light lagers like this one out there.","mmmbeer","Jan 09, 2011"

It isn't trying to be anything it isn't. It is a just a American Pale Lager which is quite easy to quaff and doesn't taste half bad.

The aroma is mainly a slightly sweet malt character with a hint of grassy hops present. The taste is much better than the appearance and aroma. There isn't too much going on, but there is a nice drinkability to the beer. The malt character is not to prominent and there is only a slightly hoppy taste, but the mouthfeel and overall drinkability make me appreciate this beer. Overall this is the kind of beer I want after mowing the yard or while I am sitting in a ballpark. It is not the greatest beer in the world, but for being an easy drinking lager it hits the spot.","ugaterrapin","Apr 12, 2010"

It's a clean smelling and clean tasting beer. There is some sweetness and some acerbic bite from the flavor and the carbonation. I like the carbonation. It's probably even more drinkable than I'm giving it credit, but the aftertaste is not entirely pleasing.

With a name like that it must be good. And the price, very reasonable. Well I wasn't disappointed. The smell of this beer is a nicely balanced malted grain and sweeter hop smell. The color (it pains me to pour it out of the cool bottle) is golden yellow. The carbonation is perfect, there is a sublime fog that exits the bottle when you open it. The flavor is exquisite, sweet yet ever so slightly hopped to balance and give a sweet dry finish. This is the beer everybody else drinks, but this one has premium flavor and is robust. A true pleasure to drink. I will be buying this in quantity. Drinkability is off the scale. For the style of beer, we may need to give out a new "Blue Ribbon."","mooseisloose","Aug 30, 2008"

No hops detectible, but a fuller flavor than expected, while remaining simple. Smooth medium mouthfeel. The beer is called a session lager, and I cant argue with that. Good abv. and decent flavoring.

This beer has a fizzy feel to it, like a macro, but no adjunct like flavors to it. However, the flavor really doesn't thrill me much more than a good adjunct macro.

Nothing too loud. T: Very light but actually very nicely balanced. Some flour, very distant hops, slightly dry finish. Very, very clean. Maybe some slight citrus in there. M: Crisp, coarse, refreshing. D: I wasn't expecting much, my mom picked up this beer when I was home in Idaho because she thought the bottle was cool. I expected a bland macro lager but I was willing to give it a chance after I saw it was full sail, and I was pleasantly surprised. Really nice drinking beer. Like a really nice version of Budweiser.

Crisp light malts and subtle noble hops dominate the nose. The initial taste is very close to the nose, malts transitioning to slight hops. Good. It is refreshingly light in the mouth without being weak. This beer is everything a light lager should be. With a tad more hops it could be a killer German Pilsner. I dig the 11oz. bottle but know that I am getting ripped off in the long run. However, underneath each cap is either a paper, scissor, or rock, so it can make for an interesting game throughout the night.

It has a very appetizing aroma that reminds me of apples and grapes; it has very sweet and mildly citrusy perfume thats clean and tempting.

3.38,-7.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Full Sail's Session lager in the stubbie bottle is a beautiful thing - it fits so nicely in the hand it's almost a shame to pour it into a glass. However, once poured it displays a clear yellow-gold body and creamy bright white head that holds seemingly forever. In fact, even three quarters of the way through the glass it's still a complete covering. The nose is clean, and expresses sweet malt and a touch of yeasty fruitiness (apple, berry). The mouthfeel is a touch fuller than might be expected with a dextrinous, medium body, but it remains fairly crisp across the palate. The flavor is basic, and not much more than might be expected of an American macro-lager except that it's a touch more malty and has some nice yeastiness to it. Hops are relegated to the background, and their gently spicy and floral character is secondary to the sweetish malt. Interestingly, as I'm guessing it's intended, there's a smear of corn-like dimethyl sulfide that clearly pushes it into the American, rather than European, realm. It's an enjoyable and nicely done quaff that seems popular with the younger crowd - probably because of the retro appearance of the bottle and label - but it's nothing spectacular.","NeroFiddled","May 11, 2007"

Clean pale malt smell (the only reason I know is that I was smelling some actual pale malt about an hour ago). It comes acoss as a mild biscuity smell. Tastes macro-like with a richer sweet. The hops are dark, like those used in Budweiser, but the hops here are stonger and blend into the malt sweet more readily. Nice aftertaste that consists of an aromatic hop floral dancing around with a rising, falling, rising, falling grain sweetness. Hop bitter is low and wet sweet carries the day. Carbonation is higher than I'd like and the acrid sting on my tongue is a distraction. Near the end of the glass, which has warmed quite a bit, I get some cardboard and a bit or tart, like raspberry. Medium body that keeps the darker hop character around. Decent beer, but not one I will purchase in the future. Many other beers that suit my stout-and-IPA palette better.","mentor","Oct 10, 2005"

I found this at QFC for $10 a halfer, and i'll definately pick up some more. It's great with BBQ chicken Thighs, and as a bonus there is either a "rock", "paper", or "scissors" logo under each cap.

3.41,-6.6,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Marketing aside, how's the beer? It's a decent, all-American golden lager, very close to what the megas make. It has perhaps a bit more ooomph, just a bit more flavor, and a cleaner profile. But it's got those mild if prickly, tangy hops in the nose to remind you of cheaper brews. The finish is succinct and keeps you coming back for more; drinkability is very high which stands to reason since that is the beer's sole reason for existing. I imagine many will love this but most BAs will probably taste this, think "hmm, ok, fine" and quickly move on to something more substantial. Bring this to a party, or on a trip where trunk space is at a premium (the stubbies take up less room than longnecks). This is a good choice if you are spending time with those suspicious of beer snobbery, but the beer tastes much better poured into a glass, hence you may need to blow your cover.","Thrasher","Jun 13, 2005"

3.72,1.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Discussion of the appearance must start with the bottle; Full Sail was reportably able to purchase the original molds from the now defunct Olympia brewery for a truly retro look that has a lot of sentimental value here in the north west. The beer its self is pale golden with with a light half inch head and a bit of lacing. Aroma is lightly hopped with hints of hay and tin. The taste is very full for an American lager. It's refreshing to be able to taste hops and barley in what is essentially a "Miller Time" sort of beer. Mouth feel is a little flat, and could use a hint more carbonation. Over all a very drinkable beer. Go pick up a 12 pack.","mrgrandefromage","May 17, 2005"
