Aroma is light grainy malt with a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is similar, grainy malt and light grassy hops, but has some nice biscuit malt flavors in the finish that redeemed it and made it a nice accompaniment to an Indian restaurant meal. Light bodied. I wasn't expecting much and so this light, slightly grainy lager was fine for dinner. The biscuity finish was more enjoyable than I expected and I would consider this again for a similar meal rather than a sweeter adjunct style lager.","LiquidAmber","Jan 23, 2015"

The flavour grew on me a little as I made my way through the glass, but not enough to give this anything more than a mediocre grade - because it is just a mediocre pale lager. If you're at an Indian restaurant  and the beer selection is limited, this would be a viable option, but I can't envision a situation where I'd go out of my way to drink this again.","thehyperduck","Nov 30, 2014"

When I drank this in India you had to up end it in water to let the glycerine fall out or it gave the runs. That said in the Thar Desert it was pretty drinkable but we were so thirsty we may have settled for camel piss. And this beer I suspect is not far removed. The flavour lingers for a good time which is always nice if you are drinking something good but in this case it is not….","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 23, 2014"

Smells of light sweet bready malt with a hint of sulfur and very light spicy hops. The flavor is light sweet bready malt with light hop and little else. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick watery mouthfeel. Straight forward macro lager, a bit on the sweet side but loaded with bland. I could drink this if I had to or if it were 105 degrees, but given the chance I would pick something else first.","johnnnniee","Nov 24, 2013"

A interesting, malty smell that reminded me very much of an American Macro (interestingly enough, while claimed to be from India, it was listed as brewed and bottled by an American company; not very pleasing to me considering it came in a "Beer from around the world" sampler I picked up). A smooth, malty taste with a sweet aftertaste. I did not know what to expect here, but it was similiar to Bud mixed with Miller Lite. It was an okay mouthfeel but wasn't overly impressed.

That said, it's a South-Asian equivalent of Heineken or Carlsberg lager, dependable but not very exciting.

The mouth is very pirckly and light. The taste starts with standard adjunct malt and skunky hops. There's a slightly sweet moment, followed by a fairly substantial metallic hoppy bite. The bite is stronger than most macros would produce, and lasts a bit longer, pushing this beer just slightly, ever so slightly, above average.","Globetrotter","May 01, 2004"

It is light with a grainy pale malt flavor on top of a dry lager yeast finish that refreshes on the way down. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation.

I am not sure, but the smell was rather pronounced, and not altogether unpleasant. The taste was thin, and had the same sweetness that I detected in the smell. There was a mild, but pleasant hop character. The mouthfeel was on the thin side, but was clean, with mild carbonation. The drinkability was OK.

It does it's duty in pairing with some really spicy Indian dishes, and according to my roomate from last year, Chaitanya it's the only thing drinkable in his hometown of Bangalore. A very sweet corn and rice filled aroma, this beer is definitely swill, but it is swill I would rather pay for than our swill here Bud, Miller, Coors. When I went to eat with my exroomate at an Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA he said it doesn't taste the same as it does back home, in fact I think it's brewed somewhere in New York. Overall, very light bodied and drinkable. It has a sweet crisp lemon grass finish that goes very well with the food I have eaten with it. So, this one's for you Chai!!!","WVbeergeek","Feb 24, 2003"

A dry, hoppy play upon the tongue and mouth, with a short, but nice finish. Light in body, texture, and just about every other way. Compared to other lagers of this type, it's one the best. Just enough flavor to make it palatable, but it's real purpose is to wash down the heat of hot and spicy food and keep those tastebuds cooled for the next onslaught.

Upon opening a skunky aroma emerges before you can even pour the clear, yellowish gold body topped by a full foamy bright white head. The head drops quickly leaving a decent collar and some spotty lace. The body is light/medium with a fine, moderate carbonation that leaves it lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor is of a clean malt that's well infused with a light grassy hop flavor and moderate bitterness. It finishes with a mild herbal hop flavor and gentle residual bitterness. Reminiscent in many ways of Heineken, but lighter all around. Actually somewhat refreshing, giving it a little bit of drinkability. Certainly more engaging than a light beer.
