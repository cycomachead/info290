This beer poured very average out of the can, with no distinct hints or aromas.  I thought it would be average, but it wasn't!  This beer has an extremely crisp and pure taste to it and a great mouthfeel as it goes down smoothly.  The taste is of malted hops and barley, and I would definitely give props to Ska for this one, even though I haven't been as kind to them in the past.

Aroma is sweet grains and grassy, herbal hops. Flavor picks up with the aroma on sweet grains, slightly biscuity note and mildly hoppy/bitter finish. It has good balance and a clean, crisp taste, Mouthfeel suffers from something. I get this rough after-feel from some canned beers that is hard to describe.

I love that marriage of feelings here. the flavor is mild, good crisp finish and flavor from the lager yeast, and only enough hops to clean up the soft malt sweetness. this is infinitely sessionable at a super low abv and a lot of interesting flavors for the style. its no bruery humulus, the standard by which I will measure every other lager I ever drink, but its a good summer session beer, and its damn good with a burrito.

It has a very light aroma, some wheat smells and mild spice comes through but not much else. Light on the tongue and light in mouthfeel too, this beer does have that skunked quality some Mexican lagers have, it’s not very powerful but the mild skunked taste is there(but is absent in the aroma).

More sweetness via honey, corn, molasses and malted milk balls, peach to apricot fruit and a splash of mixed citrus. Simple bread grains and oats, little about it seems hoppy.

3.55,6,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall Impression: As expected, this was a lighter beer. However, it was obvious that this wasn’t a watered down beer made with rice. It had a good, almost pilsner-like, bready maltiness, and the Saaz hops flavor in the finish added a nice bit of bitterness. The flavors proved the quality of the beer, but it was very drinkable, and went down very easily. Don’t let the name make you think you’re getting something watery, like a Corona.

It had a nice two-day ride from Media back to Lancaster with a hiatus in the 30th Street Station baggage room, so it may have been shaken to some extent. The Glug got me two foamy fingers of bone-white head with good retention. Color was a fizzy sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was kind of weak, as if the chainsaw was the only thing going Saaz. Instead, it was more on the malty side with some light grassiness underneath. Mouthfeel was medium with a slight malt sweetness and a mild grassiness. What I did not like was a metallic taste on the finish and I do not want to hear about it being in a CAN! I deCANted it into a glass and if you are not aware of modern CANs' lining, I am not going to explain it to you. It just was not a very tasty beer and not worthy of cooler space.","woodychandler","Jul 10, 2011"

Hops provide a snappy bitterness on the finish, but I wouldnt mind a little hop flavor here. Not really all that impressed with this one, and waaay too expensive at $10 a sixer to compete in a mundane style category.

3.4,1.5,3,3,3.5,3,4,"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a sun bleached straw color with a modest bright white frothy head that evaporates leaving a thin but concealing sheet of lace. Nose is fresh and crisp with a fair malt sweetness pretty much standard for a lager, start is mildly sweet, grain presence adequate, top is light in its feel to the palate. Finish has the customary lager acidity with the hops understated, dry and thirst quenching on this 110 degree day in Arizona, cant complain about that.","Gusler","Jul 10, 2006"
3.28,-2.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"The taste is light up front, initially dry, but quickly picks up a sweet grain note that carries through to the finish. The finish has that sort of adjunct grain thinness to it that makes me think they must have added something other than malt to this. Very light and refreshing, the hops add a nice spiciness to this beer that almost offsets the adjunct notes. I get hints of lemon zest, and an herbal sort of grassy note. They really hit the parameters for this style; darn clean, to non-existent yeast profile and it even gets the macro brew taste down. Having said that, there are a million other beers that I would rather be drinking, but that is because I am not a fan of the style.","Gueuzedude","May 08, 2006"
