3.81,7.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from the bomber into a pilsener glass. A golden yellow lager with creamy white head, somewhat milkshake-like, with a pleasantly assertive hop-forward aroma. Nose is floral, tropical, and somewhat spicy, with a subtle backdrop of bread-like malts. The tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, lychee) sweetness builds nicely and this is certainly a brew to enjoy on the aroma basis. On the palate, there is a delicate but flavorsome honeyed breakfast cereal and light molasses malt background propping up more tropical fruit and pine flavors, along with gooseberry, white grape, mustard salad green, melon, canned peach, and faint citrus rind. Finishes rather bitter and medicinal, with a little grain husk ... Dry! I am always a tad surprised by the combination of a fairly thin body, heavy carbonation, and assertive hop flavors that is unique to an "India Pale Lager". One keeps expecting to taste sweeter malts, more body, and more esters, and instead one gets naked, rather delicate hop flavor, some cereal grain, and a residual sweetness that you just can't quite grasp. This one showcases a solid array of different hop aromas and flavors, relatively unencumbered by the malts. I can dig it, not as a replacement for the usual but as a nice change of pace.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 13, 2014"

The aroma is a bit light, but the hops a present and smelling inviting. Mild apple and orange come through along with a mixture of citrus fruits. At first taste it crisp, slightly creamy and the hops are the first flavor you taste. Grapefruit and orange zest come in next and then the malts kick in. This one feels more like a lager at first but then quickly changes into a nice mild IPA. The aftertaste is all IPA, the hops are strong and the alcohol is barley tasted, but none of the flavors overpowering. Overall this is a pretty good beer and I look forward to trying their others.","vickersspitfire","Jan 21, 2013"

It may be generously hopped for a lager, but folks thinking they're getting a legit IPA may be disappointed. That said, I don't drink lagers much, and often the ones I do drink are ones like doppelbocks, so not really what people think of as lagers. It isn't that often that thinner "lawn mower" beers appeal to me. And Sword Swallower may not be lawn mower beer, but it is a lager and I like it. I guess that is because it has way more flavor, depth and character than most lagers. I like the idea, and the execution is pretty good, though there are some rough edges that could be smoothed out.

The malt come through, which I appreciate. Taste is kind of all over the place (not in a balanced way though). The astringency makes the linger very short and the alcohol is somewhat boozey and sticks out a bit. When I first heard of the concept of using lager yeast in an IPA (an IPL if you will) I thought "that's neat how come lots of brewers aren't doing this?" After tasting this I can see why.

It's a solidly medium body beer, aggressively flavored for a lager but pretty drinkable, well balanced, bright and tasty. It's smooth, and easily one of the best lagers a hop lover will encounter.

Mouthfeel was medium with an immediate intermingling of grassy hops and yeasty spice on the tongue. Now, we're talkin'!

Smell leans towards the biscuity side, with some herbal, spicy hops in the background. Taste is dominated by spicy hops, with the biscuity malt taking a back seat. The hop presence is very pronounced on this one, makes me think of oily hop resins. Feel is heavier than i expected, for this style anyway. Drinkability suffers a little bit for me with the sticky, bittering hops. It seems like they may have overdone it a bit.

The aroma is quite good, some nice citrus underneath, mild malt lagery presence in the nose. The taste is a crisp in the mid section, ample malts, but then the biting lemon hoppiness, maybe a peppery spiceness just takes over. The mouthfeel is a tad watery and tad oily on the tongue. The aftertaste is a continuation of the biting pepperishness in the finish. This isn't a particularly enjoyable lager, nor is it refreshing.

The taste was very good, it reminded me a little of some hoppy pilsners I've had, a hops cherry on a malt sundae.

4.15,16.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"22oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy, pale gold. Plenty of carbonation with a finger of fine bubbled white head. Nice noble hop aroma with malt. A hint of cardboard. Really solid malt base, almost bock like. Good dose of hop bitterness that is drying in the finish. Clean and flavorful. Another solid beer from Shmaltz.","homebrewhawk","Jul 19, 2008"
3.78,6.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"D - This was probably one of the hoppiest all-malt lagers that I've had. Pretty good.","zeff80","Beers"
3.68,3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This one's filling and refreshing at the same time. I'll tell you, it's certainly a good beer for right after a Saturday afternoon nap. Recommended.","BeerSox","0"
3.53,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Coney Island Sword Swallower pours a pale copper color witha thin white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma isn't particularly strong, a bit of sweet malt, a hint of hops. The flavor is quite hoppy up front, a bit floral and a bit spicy, the aftertaste is a bit lacking however as the flavor quickly disappears. Worth a try.","Drew966","Jul 16, 2008"
3.23,-9,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"D - This beer is a bit odd but is certainly drinkable. This would be good with grilled fish and maybe a bucket of Rhode Island steamers.","pinotboy007","Jul 11, 2008"
3.73,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"If the ABV was a little lower this would score higher. Bitter lagers do exist and this is one of them. An alternative to an IPA on a hot day.","morimech","Jul 08, 2008"

3.45,-2.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Smells of barley and grass, with some orange. Taste is quite good, refreshing hops...a mix of citrus and mild spice....on a well established...but light...malt body. Some nice complexity in the hop/malt bridge, hints of apple, rye bread. Tangy, clean and moderately dry finish. light to medium bodied. A nice lager, though one better served in 12oz bottles, methinks, to make it more accessible.","aforbes10","Jun 30, 2008"
4.25,19.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Sword Swallower is quite a good brew from He'Brew; simple, yet complexingly hopped in its dry finish and overall tone and character. Plus, I think its probably much easier to swallow then an actual sword?","tavernjef","Jun 28, 2008"
4.25,19.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The beer poured a clear honey-amber with a foamy, white head into a pint glass. The aroma was of citrusy hops and sweet malt. The taste was a very pleasant, full bodied hop flavor, dissipating into a sweet malt finish with a great hop bite. Good carbonation and lacing. This is one of the beers in their "Coney Island" series. The high ABV is masked very well, making this a surprisingly drinkable beer.","pershan","Jun 28, 2008"
4.03,13.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Final Note: This beer, as well as all of the other Coney Island beers are brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY at the Medicino brewery.","JoeyBeerBelly","Jun 27, 2008"
3.65,2.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Hop presence intensifies as it warms. Drink this one cold. I might just be saying this because it's hot as fuck now. But the flavor kinda twangs off into left field when it gets warm. Drink it cold. If you like the super bitter, let it warm.","baos","Jun 26, 2008"
3.82,7.6,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a perfectly clear straw color with a very slight, minimal head. Faintly sweet, toasty malt aroma that is very subtle. Nice citric hop flavors and bittering coupled with a solid malt profile. Slightly sticky, husky aftertaste. Quasi-creamy mouthfeel with a slick, juicy and smooth palate presence. A well hopped lager for sure, but still retaining characteristic lager drinkability. Interesting brew that's worth a try.","sinistermadman","Jun 22, 2008"

3.16,-11,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured a clear amber, like iced-tea. had a very thin head with a thick ring clinging to the sides of the glass. smelled sweet and malty, like brown sugar with a little bit of metal. tasted syrupy with the sweetness and smoothness of honey. some caramel tossed in... very reminiscent of a Polish or Russian lager... which i don't prefer. however, there was the slightest pleasant bitterness which gave it a little kick near the end, along with the smell and taste of alcohol. aside from the bitterness, it's really not very unique. i can get a Russian lager for less than half the price and almost the same taste. still, it wins points for novelty and a freaky label.","getalife2k5","Jun 10, 2008"

3.97,11.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is another well done lager from Shmaltz with tons of hops and rye notes and a great drinkibility for a 7% beer. I would definitely visit this again.","Kegatron","0"
