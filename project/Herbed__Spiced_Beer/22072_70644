3.62,4,4,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,"This one pours orangish red with an off white head that fades fast. The smell is faint, some sweet notes and malty goodness. The taste is interesting, it starts with an almost wine like flavor, then has some spice notes, followed with subtle fruit. This one is a bit harsh on the palette, a decent medium mouthfeel. Overall I thought this was a very interesting beer, decent session beer if you can enjoy it, I think it is worth a try.","wingman14","Mar 03, 2015"

3.58,2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 4/30/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of berries, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, flowers, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and herbal/floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale/bready malt and hibiscus/orange peel spice notes; with decent strength. Taste of berries, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, flowers, honey, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/floral earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness/tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of berries, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, flowers, honey, bread, and herbal/floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of pale/bready malts and hibiscus/orange peel spice flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good hibiscus spiced beer. Good balance and robustness of pale/bready malt and hibiscus/orange peel spice flavors; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 05, 2014"

3.73,7.2,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Verdict: A very interesting beer from Revolution, a very nice presentation of hibiscus, but there is little else in terms of complexity or interest. That being said, this beer is very refreshing and quite the thirst quencher, a crushable summer beer that breaks for the norm of lighter pale ales, session ales and lagers. I often find myself wondering why I don't pick this up more often in the summer months, a very worth while brew.","kevanb","Jul 15, 2014"

3.64,4.6,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"One of the first beers brewed outside of Belgium that pour a magenta hue with a pink tinged head, these Rosa Hibiscus beers don't pull any punches. Fine speckled lacing left intricately adds to the beauty of the beer. Aroma has notes of a citrus based wheat with floral notes galore, so flowery in the aromatics that it really rises up to the Rosa namesake. A nice base beer maybe some wheat in the malt bill, slightly citric tartness, bitterness derived from the hibiscus hops added color seems natural not dyed like most unique colored beers out there. This proves that Revolution doesn't really make any bad beer, it's that good. Other than the hibiscus I'm guessing there's some citrus peel and dried spices added to the mix but I can't really pick them out amongst the heavier floral forward notes. Mouthfeel has a nice dryness not overtly sweet, earthy, floral notes galore with even carbonation for the style a bit dead on and not aggressive in anyway...I'd call it lighter bodied. Overall impressive canned offering from an innovative brewer, I bet they sell a ton of this...even if it's not the most unique beer I've ever tasted out of these floral aka rose hips infused beer this is a solid drinkable version of a difficult style to make balanced.","WVbeergeek","Jun 25, 2014"

Smell is slightly sour with malt, grain, fruit, and hibiscus aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour grain and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, light, and refreshing.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 02, 2014"

3.92,12.6,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"The hibiscus adds a gorgeous ruby hue that imparts a pinkish head, which is quite fluffy with great retention. Extreme floral notes trick your nose into believing it’s in a flower shop. The hibiscus is very prominent, but lets subtle notes of white peppercorn, honeydew, biscuit, and honeyed malt show their presence. A honey-like sweetness makes up the backbone on the palate. Delicate floral notes of rose petal and, of course, hibiscus pleasantly grace and compliment the honey sweetness. Despite the fragileness of the floral notes, the body is quite strong, yet super drinkable and refreshing. If there were ever a perfect lawnmower beer, this would be it.","_YellowBird_","Mar 05, 2014"

I give points here for creativity, and for innovation, but this isn't a beer that's anywhere near my wheelhouse. the flowers were too dominant for me, this could use some refining.","StonedTrippin","Jul 11, 2013"

I was expecting a stronger habiscus influence that was not present in this beer. I truly believe that a habiscus steeped beer can be made a bit better with a greater proportion of habiscus ratio in order to be a great summer beer when you are mowing the lawn or doing some grilling.","beeroverwineguy","May 08, 2013"

No hops or anything else to remind you, "Hey, this is beer!" Another one of those beers that sounds good on paper and just doesn't work in practice. It wasn't horrible, at least it was drinkable, but I wouldn't order it again.","Bedhead","Sep 16, 2012"

3.62,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The 2011 Bachelor Party Extravaganza moves south to Sheffield's. The inaugural brew pours a clear pink-ruby topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises hibiscus (I knew it was some sort of sweet-smelling flower, and finding out which one made my mind sleep slightly easier), sweet honey, light black cherry, light red grape, and a touch of caramel. The taste holds notes of honey-dipped red apple, dark cherry, and that same bit of caramel. The hibiscus comes back in near the finish, allowing for a sweet floral character to break through. Everything comes off as very sweet, but also kinda tart. It's a strange sensation on the tongue. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, an interesting beer, to say the least; one I'm glad I got to try, but not one I plan to revisit any time soon.","TMoney2591","Jul 12, 2011"
