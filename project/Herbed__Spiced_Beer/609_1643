Tastes like a highly carbonated version of the same.  Actual ginger flavor here is, to my palate, too washed out, like all too much bad gingerbread.  And unfortunately this beer hasn't got much else going for it.  Mid-grade over-gassed molasses cookie beer.","hreb","Dec 13, 2014"

Some hint of dark malts is present, but very subdued. The body barely makes it past the light category. Very well carbonated, which helps bring forth what flavor is there. Like the nose, dark malt flavor is subdued resulting in a profile that is mostly ginger. While not overpowering, it is rather mild, the ginger needs to be balanced with a background malt flavor profile. The finish is somewhat crisp with a residual weak ginger astringency. Not a bad beer, but it could be improved upon.","tillmac62","Dec 06, 2013"

The taste doesn't just quite work. I taste the porter base, and I taste the spices, but they never come together at all. Instead, it's like taking a swig of ginger beer, sprinkling a little nutmeg in, and chasing it with the most generic porter body imaginable.

My partner drinking with me had three separate sips from the glass we were sharing before I was ready to relieve my nose from the empty bottle. Then I had my first sip...initially the mouthfeel was Christmas time all over again, but within seconds I had snapped out of my flashback. My scores reflect my excitement as I watched the ale being poured and then handed the bottle. My overall score is my confusion of how fast that taste was gone.

Nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cinnamon with caramelized sugars and a touch of dark roasted malts. Flavor is really harsh with spices, dark roasts, and a slightly burnt roasted malt coffee accent. It clashes with the base beer which is an organic porter. Wtih my next few sips I'm starting to adjust with the high level of spices and dark roasted malts, minimal herbal hops are masked by those spice additions.

Flavor is watery porter with the expected gingerbread character dominating. Doesn't taste artificial but it's just too much for me. It's like on Christmas if someone makes gingerbread cookies and you eat like 12 of them and then you never want to taste gingerbread again.

The experience is almost like taking a bit of a gingerbread cookie then having a sip of a cold dark coffee. The carbonation is ample and the mouthfeel is quite full bodied.

Very vibrant, actually. Thin head, but ehn, whatev-s. But I ended up being disappointed. The aroma was, say, from 1 to 10, a 1 when we opened the bottle because it was cold. And then it warmed up to about a 3, maybe a 4, but then it just stopped. Bitch is near room temperature and you have to swirl her and put half your face in the glass to get the scent. Boo.

4.15,22.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"After having a few standard Bison brews, I didn't hold out much hope for this brew. Glad I made the purchase. It's good beer. Begins with a maltiness that I'd expect from sweeter English and Scottish ales, but with a serious ginger addition. Doesn't really come across a gingerbread, but with a fresh ginger addition. The malts pick up on a doughy, yeasty flare, but not rounded with the nutmeg, cinnemon, or allspice. Doesn't have to; the beer is well bodied, sweet, characterful, and balanced well with English hops. Lingers a bit too long with the sweetness and a hint of graininess late. One of my favorite winter warmers of this season.","BEERchitect","Beers"

4.49,32.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Basically a gingerbread porter. Great head with strong retention atop a smokey, thick brown. Great smokey malts mixed with a much more authentic gingerbread aroma than expected. I was afraid it would be overpowering. The taste reflects the great balance of a good porter and the gingerbread. The roasty and smokey blend very well Would have gotten a five in that department except for the fact that it lost some of its balabce as it warmed up. As it warmed, it lost a little of its pleasant gingerbread quality. Smooth palate with a great linger that leaves a smaller and smaller impression of the beginning flavors.","scruffwhor","Nov 11, 2006"
3.88,14.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Bison Organic Gingerbread Ale pours a very dark brown with a thick tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is definitely spice, cinnamon stands out. I quite like the taste, it's basically a brown ale with some chocolate and coffee notes and gingerbread spicing. A nice beer for the holidays, it makes me want to get a slice of pumpkin pie to go with it.","Drew966","Oct 29, 2006"

3.53,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it is a decent spiced beer. Needs something more though to tie everything together. Reminds me too much of ginger ale at times rather then the guy who ran around trying not to be eaten. Maybe I'll give it another try around Christmas when it's colder and the spirit is gingerier.","NCSUdo","May 14, 2006"
4.05,19.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Being the season for the winter beers I like to try em all, and when this one caught my eye I had to grab it. Pour was a bit shocking, I guess I was expecting a lighter beer originally, but this poured a dark brown with a nice half inch head that slowly receded to lacing. Smell was a nice balance of gingerbread and chocolate. Taste caught me offguard, again I was kinda expecting this to be lighter, but was rather delighted by the taste, which was basically like a gingerbread porter. Really unique compared to anything i've had. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not too bad, quite enjoyable. Drinkability was pretty good for me, this is a nice beer to have with a dessert or just to sip for a festive occasion. A pretty tasty offering from Bison.","Iguana","May 02, 2006"
3.6,5.9,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"A nice spicey indulgence that was not a pain to drink, but it lacks the complexity it needs to be a super-recommendable beer. An enjoyable beer with a bit of a difference, just nothing outrageously good.","Metalmonk","Apr 21, 2006"

3.62,6.5,4,4.5,3,3,4,"While perusing the beer section at my local grocery I came across this interesting sounding beer. "Gingerbread ale", the text described it as a porter but after pouring this into my glass i realized it really isn't a porter at all, far too light. A pretty brew nonetheless, dark brown and only slightly translucent, the head was small and faded quickly with no lacing. Smell was very interesting with clear ginger scents at the nose. Unfortunately this scent doesn't transfer to the taste as well as I hoped with the ginger being noticeable but very faint. Tastes like a flat brown ale, or a very light porter without much in the way of roasted flavors. Mouthfeel was extremely light considering the dark hue of this beer, very confusing. After all this beer is interesting and worth trying, its just that nothing jumps out to make me want to try it again.","masikon","Nov 04, 2005"
4.34,27.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I guess I got a better bottle than the average of the reviewers, but I really liked this one. I actually had this one a long time ago, but luckily I found the review I wrote down. I also will never forget the taste of the beer. The taste and the smell of the beer were very similar. They both had a strong taste of ginger and spices, very much like gingerbread. It was so much like gingerbread, it was uncanny. It also had a bit of a hop bite in the end, so it wasn't all malty. I would suggest this brew to most anyone, especially ones you want to show what craft brews are like.","JISurfer","Oct 07, 2005"

3.5,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very interesting ginger flavoured beer. I was never a big fan of ginger, so obviously this won't be one of my favourites, but I'll try to be objective. Pours a light clear brown body, thin white lace. A subtle gingerbread aroma, reminiscent of gingerbread cookies. Sweet, sharp and slightly fruity. Medium bodied, easy drinking and refreshing.","baiser","Jul 22, 2005"
4.12,21.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth caramel scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It also has an awesome gingerbread aroma that is very enticing. The taste is good. It has a roasted toffee flavor that is sweet and smooth on the finish. It also has a mild, not over the top, gingerbread taste that is very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good seasonal brew. It's smooth and full of flavor; a good drinker.","WesWes","Jul 12, 2005"

4.47,31.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a brownish red color. It has a light brown head that fades quickly, leaving very few laces. The aroma is a little hard to describe. It smells like a gingerbread man. It has a spicy aroma also, but mostly, just gingerbread. It also tasted like a gingerbread man. A liquid alcoholic gingerbread man. It is better than I expected. It is quite good. It has a spicy taste also. Ginger, nutmeg, cinnimon. It also tastes a little sweet. I cant really detect any hops over the spicy flavors. This beer is mild, and refreshing. It leaves a spicy ginger aftertaste. It might be a little overcarbonated, but not so overcarbonated that it detracts from the beer. I think this beer would make a great session beer. The flavor is quite appealing, and I dont think it would get old. Also, the alcohol content, while not stated, is rather low, I think, and that means you could drink a few of them. If you see this one, buy it. Try it. You might like it.","OStrungT","Feb 11, 2005"
2.79,-17.9,4,2.5,3,3.5,2,"Surprisingly, the taste of gingerbread isn't quite so obvious. It is there, but you get some sweet and hoppiness, too. However, with the smell of the gingerbread enhancing the flavor, it makes it stronger and you either have to keep from breathing while sipping or put up with it. It gets old fast, though, and I hard a hard time finishing one.","misterscooter","Jan 10, 2005"

2.26,-33.5,4,3,2,1,2,"This beer is an utter failure. A drainpour if I ever saw one. The core of the beer's problems may be in the low quality of organic malt available - I've noticed similar failings in other organic beers I've tried. Whatever the case, this beer is woefully unbalanced, and is screaming for a heavier malt element.","Crotor","Oct 03, 2004"

4.04,18.8,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer after its extrication from the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a slightly beclouded deep mahogany with a modest semi-creamy tan head thats dissipates leaving a thick and sticky sheet of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose is like sniffing a gingerbread cookie, sweet with hints of vanilla, fresh a quite appetizing; start is sweet with a rich malt profile and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is striking in its acidity with the hops purposeful in their spiciness, the ginger noticeable in the devastatingly dry aftertaste, different for sure.","Gusler","Jan 10, 2004"
3.95,16.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Herbed/Spiced beers are hard to do well in my experience. Plenty of brewers seem to have trouble getting the flavor profile and the degree of spicing just right.

I'll also give Bison points for originality; a gingerbread porter is a new one on me.","BuckeyeNation","Beers"
3.49,2.6,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: I happen to like the traditional Ginger Beers, so a GingerBread Ale or Porter to be more specific was intriguing. I think Bison pull it off to be honest, but it will always be specialist in its appeal I feel. Unfortunately my fridge has somehow reset itself recently, and I served this one far too cool to start with. Let this offering warm up to get the very best from it for sure. Very enjoyable, and a nice twist on the Porter theme. Worth trying.","TheLongBeachBum","0"
3.88,14.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"When poured, it showed a dark brown with very little foam and there was some lace. The smell of spices and roasted malts filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had a spice and roasted malt feel on the palate. Spices like nutmeg, all-spice and cinnamom and a hint of dark bitter chocolate. Nice bitter/sweet finish that was not overpowering!","BeerManDan","Jul 30, 2003"
3.58,5.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It's extremely deep chestnut body appears black in the glass, but displays brilliant ruby highlights when held to the light; and the creamy, yellowish-tan head maintains a solid 1/4" cap throughout the glass and leaves some nice lace along the way. Cinnamon is evident in the nose along with some mild, dark fruitiness and a dry, bready maltiness. It's mildly crisp in the mouth to start-off with as its medium body releases its median carbonation; and it warms to become lightly creamy as it crosses the palate. At first its flavor is dominated by a cinnamon spice that seems to dull it's bready, lightly toasty, and even slightly chocolatey malt; and then a ginger note steps forward to totally eclipse whatever maltiness may have been there - and it finishes very dry (but not bitter) with a lingering note of ginger. The spices are there, clearly; just not the sweet malts needed to back them up.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
3.16,-7.1,4,3,3,4,3,"Yet another weird taste combo that works from Bison. Deep brown color, small head. Very slight Gingerbread flavor to this porter. Malty and spicy, not very hoppy. Nice beer, but the gingerbread flavor was very subdued, I was expecting a little more flavor. But interesting.","beerguy101","0"
