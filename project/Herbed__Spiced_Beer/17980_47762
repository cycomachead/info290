Woody aroma, bready, with hints of maple. I've learned from homebrewing that maple is an extremely difficult sugar to work with, and after the yeast noms it up, it's hard to get any maple aroma or flavor remnants, so all things considered, the maple in the nose was adequate. Taste was similar to the smell, woody, bready malts, caramel, maple was more subtle at first, but came out more as the palate adjusted, moderate earthy hops, and a decent booze kick for a dry finish. Medium body, tasty, very good overall. Just don't go in expecting to get a pure glass of gooey sweet maple syrup booze.","Rifugium","Oct 28, 2012"

I think if Lawson's were to tweak the recipe a little bit they could have an A range maple beer on their hands. Still enjoyed the bottle I had though and I would love to get my hands on some Maple Tripple.","sisuspeed","Dec 04, 2010"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This tastes unique, definitely a lot of maple syrup character, sweet but not over-the-top, with a sort of sticky mouthfeel as well. That defines it more or less, really no counterplay from malts, just clean pale malts I suppose. I can't taste the alcohol but the burn comes through in the upper digestive system, making it a sipper. Rich and delicious, a good night cap of a beer.","TurdFurgison","Nov 17, 2010"
1.59,-57.1,3,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Palate is also dominated by cardboard, really oxidized and stale with a bit of maple behind it. A little toasted bitterness comes through in the finish, and an odd medicinal flavor. The body is thin. This is pretty bad.","largadeer","Nov 15, 2010"

4.03,8.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, a touch of warmth but alcohol is really well hidden. Not really any maple character but a pretty unique beer. Thanks Alex!","Viggo","Oct 30, 2010"

3.43,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Average mouthfeel and drinkability. This one drinks a lot like an American barleywine with an added dimension of having maple. I love maple so that's a good thing.","andrewinski1","Oct 27, 2010"
4.07,9.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"I shared this bottle with three other friends. Poured into a tulip. The body is maple brown with a thin off white head that doesn't retain too long and leaves a bit of spotty lacing. The aroma is toasted malts with a bit of spicy hops with just a bit of maple to the aroma. Holy rich maple! The taste is toasty with a bit of spice and a really big maple finish. The maple is bold and rich and finishes pretty nicely. I think the maple isn't too overpowering and balanced pretty well with the toasty flavor. The mouthfeel is light but the maple makes it slightly sticky. It's still nice and the carbonation is well done. For a nine percent beer, this drinks pretty well, especially on a cool Autumn evening.","Bendurgin","Oct 11, 2010"
4.17,12.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Up front this tastes like a decent brown ale, but the maple comes through perfectly in the aftertaste. A nice pleasant sipper for a fall afternoon - I shared this bottle with a friend and was itching to crack the other, but it was saved for another day. Not sure if Sean Lawson considers this his flagship beer, but it should be - this is damn fine drinking. Well done.","ElGallo","Sep 24, 2010"
4.33,16.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Apparently you can only purchase this beer by the bottle at a small store in Warren, VT. They receive small shipments and never know which type they will get each Friday. There is a 4 bottle per person per day limit. I was able to get my 4 bottle around 4pm on Saturday afternoon shortly before they sold out. The beer pours into the glass to reveal a nice hazy copper color with a thick tan head that last a while and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is mild maple, roasted malt and light apple. The mouthfeel was medium and mildly silky. There was a slight buttery feel on the lips as the beer was tasted. The first taste is mild maple with roasted caramel followed my a mild hop bitterness and an alcohol warmth in the finish. I am more of a DIPA fan, but I really liked this beer. If it wasn't for the alcohol taste in the finish it would be almost perfect.","strengthdoc","Sep 13, 2010"
4.26,14.8,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Update: The second pour from the bottle I include some floating yeast which gives a more pronounced fresh bread and maple feel. Mr. Lawson doesn't lie as this is both smooth and powerful with the alcohol approaching as it warms. Medium carbonation; a nice, sweet, and spicy libation on an early autumn evening.","ManVersusBeer","Aug 07, 2010"
3.75,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This bomber was brought back from VT for me by joshman - thanks dude. Rare batch # 135, bottle # 32. Poured into stemmed glasses. First thing I noticed was the odd color. The best way to describe it would be a dark neon rust color. A different shade of color that I have ever seen before. Nice thick bubbly head, with some good lacing. Smell was semi-sweet, a bit like a rich caramel. Taste was good, but interesting. Had a nice maltiness to it, but on the sweet side. I did not get the maple flavor, but I think that it was added merely as a way to sweeten the beer, and not necessarily as a flavor component. Mouthfeel was on the thick side, which is what I would expect from a beer made with syrup. Drinkability was fairly good, as it was a great tasting beer and the high abv was well hidden. I am glad I got a chance to try a beer from this regional brewer, and this was a nice intro.","morebeergood","Jun 22, 2010"
3.41,-8.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is interesting. Light to medium body, medium carbonation...very sharp and boozy. Not as thick and creamy as I expected. Also, not nearly as sweet as anticipated due to the description. Regardless, not bad at all...just different. Lots of strong ale resemblances. Slight hops, yeast, and again...more booze. Glad I got to try this one!","ShadesOfGray","Beers"

4.28,15.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Pours a cloudy light apple cider amber color with a BIG stiff off white head that resists fading and leaves a nice amount of Belgian lacing behind. I really like the smell it's crazy sweet maple syrup and pumpkin or something, very slight spice thing happening. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated, velvety smooth and medium-full bodied. I'm starting to feel a little heat..very little. Not distracting in anyway. The flavor is sweet and malty maple syrup...seriously 'get the pancakes out'. LOVE IT!. I guess you've really got to be in the mood for this one because I don't understand the scores that it's getting. I could drink this all night long.

3.63,-2.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Out of Sean's 'Vault' this heretofore unnamed ale had been aged for two years before being released at the Lawson's Finest Liquids one-year anniversary on St. Patrick's Day, 2009. It was a perfectly clear golden-amber color with an off-white, fluffy, one-finger head. The retention was excellent and the lacing streaky. The aroma was of sour green apples, pale malt, floral hops and a touch of maple sweetness. The flavors were wild! Sour apples, tart esters, Belgian yeast, orange peel, a clear alcoholic bite and herbal elements. Very citric and acidic overall; reminiscent of a punchy, Flanders Old Bruin. Crisp but lacking enough malt to balance it. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation medium.","thekevlarkid","0"
