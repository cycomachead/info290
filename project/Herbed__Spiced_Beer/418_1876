I was expecting a well rounded beer but this just tastes an attempt to create something different for the sake of being different.  Though it has a strong ginger taste as you drink more it feels unbalanced and unrefined. The body feels too thin without much complexity.  If your expecting ginger you get it.  I don't really think I would try this again unless it was free.","upton7418","Mar 26, 2015"

It's missing the spices that one would expect out of a good ginger beer, maybe a little watered too. It's still a low abv beer that I don't mind saving for warmer days in the springtime, though.

The magnificent nose is of ginger over a biscuit background sweetness. Light medium body that is nice and smooth in texture. Above average carbonation with a strong burst of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is quite nice and focuses on ginger. It delivers the ginger at just the right level and balances it against a toasty slight biscuit sweetness. It finishes with a crisp effervescent burst of ginger and hop flavor over biscuit. An outstanding clean crisp use of ginger.","tillmac62","May 21, 2014"

3.68,8.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 9/7/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, ginger, honey, bread, floral, grass, light clove, light caramel, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of ginger, hop, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, ginger, honey, bread, floral, grass, light caramel, light clove, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, ginger, honey, bread, floral, light clove, and light caramel on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, ginger, and light hop flavors; with a fair amount of flavor robustness, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a nice spiced session beer. Good balance of malt, ginger, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

It just doesn't strike that balance. It's not that it's a bad beer, it's just not something I really care for. The body is way too thin and watery and there isn't any malt to back up the taste. It needs more residual sweetness and body. If they adjusted the recipe to do that, it could potentially attract some of the ginger ale crowd.","Mitchster","Apr 08, 2013"

Appearance upon arrival was golden in color with very little head that left lacing around the glass. Smell of ginger is distinct and I'm wondering if this will be ginger overload or what as I take a sip...everything is present in the front, though no where near the ginger I was expecting, clean yet flat finish. Wow, I was not expecting this to be underwhelming, mild taste of ginger and a quick crisp honey like taste and even a little hop before a rather bland drop off...I'm very surprised with the mildness of the ginger, it's like a hint of ginger more smell then taste even. This was a one and done for me, not bad, just wanted a little more.","Blueribbon666","Oct 01, 2011"

There is some ginger flavor to it along with some malt. Doesn't pack much punch in the flavor department but I guess too much ginger would be tough to take. Bit of an odd aftertaste as well. Slightly metallic. I guess this would be alright in the summer, but I can see drinking more than one of these a day due to the spice flavor.

3.5,3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I’ve thought about picking up a six pack of Good Juju when I saw it, but rather than going “all in” with the purchase of a six pack I instead decided to pick this one up as part of a mix six. I’m digging the label, but there’s not much else to go on. Looks like it was bottled on 3/30, so this beer should be relatively fresh. I love the concept of this as a ginger ale – so let’s see if the beer measures up. Pours a deep gold with a very sturdy head. Lots of carbonation in the beer helps support the frothy head. Smell is a little bit muted (that could be me – I’m always stuffed up, especially when travelling, as I am tonight). Taste has that ginger zing you’re looking for – the bottle says refreshing and that’s probably accurate. My palate is a bit beat up so it’s tough for me to pick out the nuances of what this beer has to offer. Malt sweetness starts things off, giving way to the ginger. As carbonation scrubs that away, hop character comes through in the finish. When I first started drinking this beer I wasn’t sure what type of style it fell into, which is fine, but if you’re looking for a classification I’d say it’s somewhere in the Pale Ale category. Mouthfeel is light without ever being watery, and the beer finishes somewhere between sweet and dry. The ginger helps keep things light and leaves you wanting to drink more. This is a beer that you could easily drink several of, especially on a warm summer night. Pretty good.","eclaycamp","May 04, 2011"

The taste holds notes of orange peel, nutmeg, ginger, coriander, flowers, and grass. The body is a hefty light/light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly refreshing finish.

I've always been a fan of Left Hand's brews, but this beer has me torn.

Flavor wise that finish is hardcore with the ginger tone, I'm guessing mild hops that are pretty much impossible to recognize with the ginger overpowering. A bit one sided on the ginger ample sweetness but sort of an astringent quality arises especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, carbonation level is a bit spritzy but not over the top.

Aroma is mainly ginger, with some orange, apple and hops noticable too. Taste is also mostly ginger, but I can also taste some lemon, grains and hops. Mouthfeel/body is light, with average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's easy to drink but with the ginger I don't think I could drink more than 2-3 of these at a time.

3.52,3.8,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"With a few fixes, Juju Ginger could be good. More malt, lose the Saaz, jack up the ginger and cut the carbonation by half. Now that's a beer that I'd buy in a heartbeat. Although I believe that it has too many faults as is, it may be exactly what the boys at Left Hand were shooting for. I'll happily finish the bomber however and will dream of what could have been.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 01, 2004"
3.18,-6.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This came in a 22oz bomber. This poured out a clear light amber color with a tall rocky white foam head. Not much retention as the head goes quickly leaving some sticky lace around the glass as it is consumed. Aroma is fairly weak but pleasant with a bit of ginger standing out over sweet malt. Flavor is more of the same with a sweet malt taste being slightly tweaked by the ginger and a slight earthy hops presence. Very light overall taste with a slight lingering ginger after taste. This has about a light to medium body with a clean crisp feel to it. Drinkability is all right, I do like ginger and without that this beer has little else to offer. An interesting brew that would probably pair up well with sushi though it is fairly weak in the smell and taste department. This could be an introduction to craft beer kind of beer since there is little offensive in this. Not bad but something I would only drink again with a meal that fits its flavor.","meathookjones","Sep 24, 2004"
3.47,2.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy deep orange and sports litttle to no head and only a trace of lace. Aromas are first of malt, then subtle ginger, then a splash of hop. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, though I'd hoped for more of a ginger bite. Flavors are somewhat muted as far as the ginger element. This comes off more like a light pale ale with some spice. The beer finishes sweetishly malty. A decent refresher nonetheless.","moulefrite","Aug 06, 2004"

2.83,-16.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Probably shouldn't review this one, as I didn't think I'd like it from the get go. I love ginger, but obviously not in my beer. It had a cloudy, yellow color, with a white speckeled head. The smell of ginger and hops? seemed to creep out. It was drinkable, but not for my taste. Somewhat bitter, and spicey. Also seemed thin to me. Some have compared it to ginger ale, which also wasn't a favorite of mine, but I'd rather drink that.","finepaws","Jun 19, 2004"
2.56,-24.5,4,3,2,3,2.5,"Yes this is very drinkable, but it isn't great either in the uniqueness or the overall experience departments. Not offensive, but not great either.","Zorro","May 24, 2004"
3.47,2.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer after departing the 22 ounce brown bottle takes up residence in my glass a limpid amber color with a portly light tan head that is also frothy in texture, the lace forms a nice thick sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt; a hint of ginger, fresh and clean, start is sweet, the malt acceptable, and the top fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a mild acidity, the hops personable and they become a bit spicier as the beer warms to the room, a drinkable beer, but not a big hit with me.","Gusler","May 17, 2004"
3.32,-2.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Drinakability is average IMHO. Very nice effort but one was enough for me. I'd rather have a ginger ale.","CRJMellor","May 02, 2004"
3.58,5.6,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall: This is not that bad an offering for a Ginger Ale, but I cannot see anyone who never liked Ginger Ale before taking to this. For me, I think it is a decent attempt at something that rarely seems to be attempted these days. A nice first beer after work, on what has been a hot day. Worth trying.","TheLongBeachBum","Apr 22, 2004"
2.8,-17.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Medium copper color. Faint white head, clumpy and quickly faded. For a ginger beer, really lacked any ginger smells. Nothing noticable anyway. And really nothing like the ginger ale softdrink to be sure. Taste was moderate at best. Some mild hops, faint biscuit malts underneath. Some toasty breads. No real ginger presence. For a ginger beer, it really lacked ginger flavor. Not that I am expert on these beers, but really just tasted like an amber ale. Medium to light bodied. Easy enough to drink. Just not alot of flavors here.","StevieW","Apr 13, 2004"
3.52,3.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a dark shade of orange with a quick dissapearing head,aroma of course is dominated by fresh ginger kinda sweet and and spicey pretty provacative.Taste is of ginger for sure with a toasted malt flavor that lingers in the finish,tastes better as it warms a little.A pretty unique beer not one I would get to often but not all that bad.","oberon","Apr 02, 2004"
3.23,-4.7,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Pours a translucent apricot-gold color. Despite the long-lasting effervescence feeding it, the head is minimal and quite fine. The worst part of the smell is that it is so muted. Sweet but subtle malts are there, as is the spice of ginger one would expect. This beer is crafted on a base of nondescript grains but, predictably, it is livened up with the infusion of ginger. To Left Hand's credit, the ginger is well integrated, manifesting itself first in straight ginger flavor as the initial malts fade and then as a spicy warmth in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel is good, and while this is a drinkable beer, I'm unlikely to be inspired to reach for it again.","BitteBier","Jan 25, 2004"
2.81,-17.1,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer. I like ginger, and all, but I'd never been a fan of the non-alcoholic ginger ale, and wasn't sure the alcohol would help. It poured attractively enough, a nice copper/orange color with a moderate-to-thin off white head. A good start, but the aroma was disappointing -- the ginger's there, to be sure, but apart from that, only a very light malt sweetness manages to make itself noticed. The taste, unforunately, is more of the same. Ginger right from the get-go, with the only relief to be found in a very mild slightly citric hop finish. It's not necessarily that there's too much ginger to the flavor, it's just that there's not enough else there to balance or lend any complexity to the brew. Medium-bodied with a dry finish. This beer actually might be decent if paired with the right meal -- asian stir fries or ginger-spiced chicken are the obvious candidates. I just don't think there's enough here to stand on its own, though.","mzwolinski","May 11, 2003"
3.75,10.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Came out a cloudy coppery color. Interesting aroma of ginger, with a hint of aprictos in the background. Taste has a subtle amout of ginger nicely balanced with a sweet maltiness. Aftertaste of apricots comes through very cleanly. Magic Hat should make a #9+ with a little ginger thrown in. An excellent summer refresher!","Boto","Apr 29, 2003"
3.97,17.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pleasant ginger-sweet aroma and a nice color. I enjoyed the light sweet flavor. This was a pleasantly surprising Spice Beer. I have been somewhat impressed with all of Left Hand's offerings as a matter of fact.","Dogbrick","Jun 27, 2002"
3.92,15.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Notes: This beer is brewed using a pale ale as the base with the addition of fresh organic ginger root, which has been used in brewing for ages but is quite uncommon these days. As a such, Juju is a rare treat and very unique. A most refreshing beer. I can also see this being a great "chick" beer -- no offense to all the women out there, but you know what I mean -- or a great introduction beer for those who don't really like beer.","Todd","Oct 26, 2001"
