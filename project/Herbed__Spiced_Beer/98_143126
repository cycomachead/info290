This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do a good job of holding my attention, halfway through it and I' already bored of it, one is more than enough for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was nice and it worked well with this beer.  What i liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was just too bland for me.  I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it.  All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, it wasn't bad, but I just thought it was pretty boring and it didn't really have anything that it made it stick out or be memorable.  So far this is one of my least favorite Harpoon beers and I  would say it's average at best for the style.  This beer needs some work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Feb 14, 2015"

There may have been some wheat in this, which would explain the lack of sharpness in this beer. If so, it only served to confuse me as this didn't seem like something that was herbed or spiced. Worth a go once because of the quasi-uniqueness of it but this almost seemed like a ginger ale with a bit more body and no stickiness from high fructose corn syrup.","JerzDevl2000","0"

I can't really put my finger on it, but it smelled a bit sour or dare I say "skunked".  I know I have handled the beer properly, so I am guessing the odor is true. I then noticed the unfiltered orange color which is nice.  The beer is very hazy and bright.  The taste then comes together and makes me understand the beer.  The taste is very light and refreshing, I am just not so sure the unfiltered wheat style really mixes well with the ginger and orange.  I like the idea, but this was a miss for me.
