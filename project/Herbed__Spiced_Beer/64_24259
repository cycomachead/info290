The taste was nice with first the sweet honey and fruit notes, and then the grapes coming through on the finish for a tart aftertaste. The aftertaste wasn't as clean as I would have liked but very good and an interesting beer I would try again.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 23, 2015"

4.5,19.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"poured into a snifter from the jiahu bomber; a very cloudy amber beer with a head that dissolves quickly.  nose is sweet white grape.  taste is dominated by honey and muscat grape, but not cloying.  very well balanced - interesting that the main flavors are sweet, yet it remains highly drinkable with no counterbalancing hop/bitterness profile (though there is a spicy underpinning, perhaps from the 10% abv).  aftertaste, again, is a slightly dry, warm white grape.  much like dfh "red & white", i was expecting this to be a swing and a miss judging from the desciption on the bottle, but i'll be damned if i'm not enjoying it!  =)","jopezu","Mar 20, 2015"

Smells like sourish grapes, a little musty, orange peel, tropical fruits, spice, mirrors taste very well. Taste - green grapes, spicy as hell but in a good way, orange and tropical fruits, honey brings it all together very well, great flavor. Crisp, refreshing, drinks like a 5%, not getting any alcohol at all.  Dogfish head is becoming a huge favorite of mine. 120 Minute is still my number one, but this is a valiant effort. Well done.","JTbrue","Mar 14, 2015"

Aroma is sweet with touches of grape and something akin to pear and sweet fruit and there is a hint of floral hops and oh yeah, honey. I find that the honey aspect is dominant in the sweetness of the beer, the sweetness itself being the dominant aspect of the beer. There are touches of other fruit, mostly grape, and a floral edge that I know of thanks to the label. Finally tried this after years of passing and glad I did b/c I like sweet beers and this a lighter drinking sweet beer that is not too sweet.","clayrock81","Jun 03, 2014"

Scents of sweet fruit, sweet sake and aromatic flowers. It's an almost perfume like nose. Extremely appealing, easily the finest part of the beer. Flavors were very sweet. Sweet fruit, sweet moscato wine, a hint of sweet sake and a slight hint of honey on the aftertaste. The beer is extremely sweet and reminded me quite a bit of a moscato sangria or something of that nature. At 10% ABV the alcohol was not noticeable at all. Not horrible, but I couldn't drink a lot of it. Mouthfeel was light bodied with low carbonation, hiding the alcohol quite well. It was very easy to drink because of this. Overall this is a very unique beer. It is quite sweet, and in many ways has more in common with a moscato wine than a beer in it's flavor profile. However it does have an appeal and I would drink it again if the opportunity presented itself.","Auraan","Sep 15, 2013"

This is one exotic tasting brew, not quite like anything I've had before. I am reminded of other beers brewed with grapes that I have had before, and yet the other ingredients set this one far apart from the crowd. The flavor is just that much more complex and beguiling given the relative lack of aroma. It's damned delicious, though not a beer for the faint of heart - the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you! I am absolutely loving this beer (if you want to take the risk of indeed calling it a beer)!","mevett89","Jun 23, 2013"

I am well known for being in favour of sweet beers, but this was just over the top. Amazing fruity notes, though, all over the spectrum. It had a very lagery tone to it, too. Very intense, but very light in feel. I know they used sake yeast, but I wonder what temperature it was fermented at and for how long, because it was definitely far more like a really great lager than like an ale. Thanks, Dogfish head for another great beer, but if you could lay off the sugary sweetness, that would be great.","ElCommodoro","0"
3.74,-0.8,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"I love this series, and I was stoked to see this on tap at the new renegade tap house on university. it pours a hazy orange tinted thicker color, with a colossal three inch white fizzy head on top with fine retention. the nose is very unique, and I think I smell sake yeast, although im not a big sake guy generally. lots of interesting fruits as well, and a grain blend only dogfish head could come up with. the first sip I notice the feel more than the flavor, its denser than it looks, not very carbonated despite the head, and has a bit of honey type sugars on the back end, a funny feel that I don't totally love. the flavor I do love though, floral and sweet, bright, and decidedly eastern in vibe. there are ingredients here that I am entirely unfamiliar with, but much like etrusca, midas touch, and some of the others, I like the way it all comes together in an approachable but challenging way. overall a very impressive beer, especially now that I have learned this is 10% abv, a strength one would never detect from drinking this beer.

Oily, medium body and light to moderate carbonation. This one is pretty boozy and too sweet for me. Complex and worth trying.

A tip o' the Wood to my Old Lady for her expertise in this area. Lots of honey flavor on the tongue, accompanied by whichever flowers from which it was derived.

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a foamy 1-2 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of honey, pear, grape, clove, herbal, apricot, bread, earth, bubblegum, pepper, light banana, and yeast spices. Damn nice and unique aromas; great balance and complexity. Taste of honey, grape, pepper, herbal, pear, apricot, floral, clove, earth, bread, banana, orange, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, herbal, floral, clove, earth, and light yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with zero cloying sweetness for a 9% beer at 10 IBU. Fairly clean finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is yet another damn nice experimental ancient ale from Dogfish Head. Tons of flavor complexity and balance; very smooth to sip on for a 9% beer. There are also a lot of interesting flavors and aromas I cannot describe, but they work well. Very impressive.","superspak","Aug 25, 2012"

Honey sweetness up front dominates, then a wine-like fruitiness washes over the tongue and blends with a flowery brightness. At the tail end the sticky honey flavors take back over and sticks around on the tongue leaving you with a lingering sweetness but a dry finish. This is one of the best of the Ancient Ales in my opinion.","DonDirkA","Aug 04, 2012"

It is good, if you can stand the sweetness, but you can make something equally as tasty for far less money at home. It doesn't get easier than mead and I think Dogfish Head is really pushing it to sell a bomber of this for $12+. There are some distinctions in the taste because of the ingredients they used, but overall the taste is simply too reminiscent of good ol' mead. I won't buy this again.","badun","Jul 01, 2012"

The taste has a lot in common with white wine as well. There are lots of white grape flavors, sugar, and very noticeable alcohol. Pretty odd, and doesn't have much in common with what you normally expect from beer.","webmanspidey","Apr 04, 2012"

4.25,12.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Big full flavors, sweet but spicy and a healthy hint of alcohol that sets the whole beer off. A sweetness from honey adds a layer to the beer, just underneath a big and swirling floral spiciness. Definitely some fruity esters that play off all the other flavors. The alcohol taste is a big part of the flavor profile here, adding to the spiciness but never goes over the top to affect the drinkability. For 10%, you don't taste much of it at all. It takes on a white wine quality somewhere in there but the layers of complexity outshine most wines. The sweetness is counterbalanced by a small hop bitterness, nearly perfectly. This beer is light to medium in body with a nice lingering dry finish. Both of these things make this beer pop, despite its lack for a true style. Really solid beer from DFH, but what else is new.","chodinheaven","Oct 02, 2011"

Either way, although it reminds of that beer, I feel this one has more balance to it and more depth. Scent is SO strong with sweet herbs and spices. Some tropical fruit aromas and booze as well. Taste is initially sweet honey and palate-tingling spices. The herbal notes seem to dance around through each sip, gradually changing from sweet to earthy. Alcohol is not well-hidden in this beer, although I don't think it is meant to be. The grapes dont really come through until this beer warms a bit...but still subtle. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a somewhat syrupy finish. Drinkability is fair to fairly high. Overall, this is a damn tasty beer, but I can't see myself drinking too much of this.

This is a dessert beer that should be enjoyed in sips (and a glass at a time).

The mouth feel is a bit full to medium body. I guess having such a sweet taste, but sort of balanced out by the carbonation. Overall, I like what Dogfish Head does, but this wasn't one for me.

Taste is similar, honey, sweet wine, yeast, breadiness, light fruits...very complex. Mouthfeel is pretty light with a bit of syrupy film left behind, and an alcohol bite.

The background is something more along the lines of a rice lager or happoshu, but the sweetness from the honey and the flavor of the white grapes really helps to make this beer enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a tad on the dry side and I assume the combination of sake yeast and white grapes would contribute to that, but this is still a rather drinkable and enjoyable brew.

I also get a nice dose of alcohol in the flavor, but the beer is still very easy to drink, although it does get a little bit cloying at the end due to the high sugar content.

It's in the ingredients that you really find what makes this so special. And although I do enjoy the beer, I probably wouldn't pick it over a six pack of coffee stout or barleywine.

Perhaps it's the honey and grapes that dominate the remaining characteristic nuances that set this apart, because it definitely doesn't seem to be doing it any favours in that department. Unless it's to represent that most of these beers in their day were a fermentable carbohydrate blended with fermented grapes and honey as well as a standard on par. Worth trying once, and after that it comes down to personal whim.

The smell is of grapes dominating and the same goes for the taste of this brew. It's fruity and flowery and I noticed that it has a similar berry taste to the Fort. For a 10% abv. brew this is well-crafted and the mouthfeel is a medium on a scale of heaviness. The blend of exotic fruit and ingredients is clutch as always with Dogfish Head. I have now been able to compare this to the previous year's and the only difference is that I noticed the honey a little bit more last year than I did this time around.

Those ancient Chinese had a winner here...","TMoney2591","Feb 24, 2010"

The body is very light as can be expected from the rice, a lingering sour-sweetness hides behind medium-heavy carbonation. I had this on tap at the Dogfish Head rest. and pub in Falls Church Va, and I must say I was expecting the beer to be poured slightly warmer. At close to 32 degrees, it took a while for this to warm up enough to be flavorful, and even then it was a bit light for me.

The amount of spiciness is just enough to keep me involved and interested with the kick of alcohol doing the rest of the work in the finish. As far as drinkability goes, this is a very drinkable beer with the %8 ABV well hidden behind all of these beautiful spiced properties and fruit florals.

Sweet, estery nose of banana, grapes, apricot, brown baking sugar, cinnamon powder, honey, freshly squeezed orange juice, flowery like a hothouse, a blend of many distinct smells hard to parse apart. Medium-bodied, very low carbonation almost makes it drink like a still beverage. It's sweet yet, somehow, not as sweet as expected from the nose. Has a fruit juice feel, grapes blended with pear, apricot and yellow apple. The honey more dominant, less brown sugar or caramel. The tangerine citrus juicy and lends momentary tang. Very smoothly textured with a complete grip on the palate, you feel it everywhere. The floral musk takes up more space with each sip. There's a muscular lift to it, so perfumed that as it gathers around the roof of your mouth it starts to pleasantly dry out on the tongue.

Honey is the most dominant aroma with floral notes (I'm guessing from the Chrysanthemum), a bit of toffee and just a slight alcohol burn. The flavor is amazing. This, in my mind, is my favorite beer that Dogfish Head makes. The flavor is huge wild honey, flowers, and Muscat grapes, with just a hint of the 8% alcohol. It all blends beautifully together. Magnificent. The honey hits the palate on full blast, slowly running through all the other flavors but never letting your tongue slip from that initial blast of honey.

Mouthfeel is a light to medium body- very refreshing and nice for spring/summer.

Nice light golden orange color to it that was very clear and could see the carbonation thru it. When it touched my lips I got hints of honey and at some points in time I got a Budweiser kind of taste which might have been due to the rice that was used in the brewing . The second pour yielded a very fine sediment from the bottom of the bottle and the color looked different and had more of a translucent orange look, not as crystal clear as the first pour. Taste changed a little too and I got some sort of spice to it but I cannot describe it, only that it left sort of a powdery feel in my mouth.

4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a 750ML bottle, this strange fluid pours a medium yellow color, with highlights of light honey. Active carbonation bubbles soar to the surface of the liquid in the large white wine glass Im using to review this beer. The rather thin head is tight and quite sticky, leaving spots of lacing inside the glassware. The nose is quite simply otherworldly  is this beer or possibly a complex white wine? The Muscat grapes used in this beer are present right from the start and lend a very unusual wine-like bouquet to the nose, making you think you might be drinking a sparkling white wine instead of a (technically) beer. Slightly sweet on the nose as well, the wildflower honey is evident and makes one think a bit of a mead. This is either one of the most complex beers ever, or it has a serious identity crisis. Slight floral notes, which I can only assume is from the chrysanthemum, are very inviting as well. The nose is, quite honestly, more like a wine or a mead than a beer, on first blush. The palate does not pale in comparison to the nose, but grants a fuller picture of what the nose only hints at. Again, a sparkling white wine comes to mind, but the mouth feel is obviously thicker and the initial flavor substantially sweeter. The sweetness subsides a little bit as the beer sits in the mouth, and yields to a spicier, fruitier composition that reminds me of a good Belgian tripel. Without a doubt though, the honey and the grapes are dominant on the palate. The finish is moderately dry, and the carbonation is just adequate to keep this beer from being sticky and cloying. In a nutshell, this beer has a lot going on all at once. Im a little bit torn whether it all melds together masterfully, or its just a little outside the realm of congruence. Whatever your take is, however, this is clearly a well-crafted and seriously complex beer that defies style and stretches the palate in a very good way. I think if you really like a Belgian Tripel, or maybe even a saison, youll at least appreciate this beer. For me, I genuinely like it and would like to revisit it again. Like anything new, a beer that is this unique takes some getting used to. Dogfish Head does it again.","beerphilosopher","Sep 27, 2007"

Flavor starts off with a punch of cloying sweetness and fermented rice flavors (think Bud). In the middle comes a mild yet bright tartness along with some floral notes and some fruitiness that does not taste as if derived from fermentation by-products. Finishes with a bit of dryness and a return of the somewhat heavy phenlic edge. Aftertaste is rather sugary, in spite of the relatively dry finish. Mouthfeel is rather sticky and jagged (with concerns to the carbonation). Overall, I enjoy this, in a way, but honestly, this reminds me of a boozier Budweiser with a touch of cloying sweetness, a mild tart presence, and some odd phenolics (and an over-the-top price tag).

The alcohol is well hidden in the mouth, but it is a warmer on the way down. Enjoyable, kudos; scores points for imagination. I am definitely going to snag another... or so.","jjayjaye","Aug 24, 2007"

The smell is fruity with orange, something berrylike,and a waxiness and earthiness from the rice. The taste is smooth, complicated and interesting. An underlying red rice flavor seems evident, similar to a red rice saki- waxy and earthy notes. There are also substantial honey flavors, so there is a meadlike feel as well. Some slight astringent notes from the Hawthorne. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy.

It was light and spicy in the mouth, though the taste of the alcohol wasn't very prevalent, the feeling of it was there. I wasn't nuts about this one, and wouldn't be inclined to drink more than the pint I had when I shared the bottle of this with my dad.

And while the ABV is typically Dogfish-obvious, it's not so big that it limits unduly. I finished the one bottle willingly, and while a second might be pushing it, I'd drain another any time I found it in front of me.

Taste was sweet and somewhat wine-like. This beer has a very mellow fruitiness to it. Not what I would typically drink, but good. Mouthfeel is dry and smooth with well developed carbonation, despite my earlier visual observations. Moderate to high alcohol content lends to a warming sensation.

It had a nice golden honey color with a bit of orange - slightly hazy. It had about half a finger of head and a ton of initial carb. Both settled down quickly. The smell was a strong fruity smell dominated by grapes. There was also a good spicy kick in there as well. The taste followed the smell with really good fruitiness and spices to offset the sweet. It's not what you normally expect in a beer and in my mind is closer to a sweet wine but I enjoyed it. The 750ml is too much for me.

Taste had a definite sour/winey characteristic along with flavors of honey, almond and the previously mentioned rice. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Drinkability was average. This beer reminds me of a cross between a sake, mead, wine and your typical macro.

Very fresh, effervescent aroma with some unsweetened fruit scents. Upon the first sip I got a big mouthful of bready, biscuity yeast flavors. Very delicious. As it warmed up I started to get more of the wine/sake grape flavors. Very refreshing and tastey as well. I had two small glasses of this and it left me wanting more.

As it warms the alcohol intensity gives way to a defined honey sweetness, very much like a mead now. Developing later is something like pine and unripe bananas as well as some sweeter burnt sugar and malt characters lying underneath.

It has a very strong aroma that was kind of fruity and sweet like a honey smell (duh it was brewed with honey and various fruit). The color I thought was rather orange. Not like the color, but like the fruit (lighted than the color). The taste was extremely complex with so many flavors to many to mention, but really good.

The head dissipated very fast and only lingers around the very edges of the beer, however this might not be the beers fault. Both the smell and color are unlike any other beer I've had this far. It smells of white grapes, pears, grass, it really does smell like a pino gris or a sauvignon blanc. The taste is similar to wine so different, yet very pleasing, part of me just wants to say its an extremely a-typical beer. And at the same time I feel like I can trace the roots of it back to certain varietals, one things for sure it is a very special beer. The flavor is sweet and slightly tart with lots of light fruit and a sort of crisp buttery flavor. The mouthful is nice and the strength is just right. Its not a beer I'd get all the time, but it's totally worth a try and for novelty sake, show a friend the recipe is 9000 years old.","mmcave","0"

As soon as hit the palate, I was amazed at how much flavor this beer had. There was notes of honey, peach, banana, and a bit of white grapes. The finish is amazing.

I've had various food items made with hawthorns before, but this is my first beer. very exciting. So it pours out looking like carbonated grapefruit juice and has a little tiny head that fails even to cover the entire top. really looks like a mead or melomel or something, which is essentially what i plan to think of it as (more or less) considering its origins. Smells like a cyser i drank at the Bells brewpub...hints of white wine, flowers, and, of course, hawthorns (which i can clearly pick out after working with them for so long). Taste is delicate and thin...squeezed, watered down haw juice, oranges, some alcohol noticeable. really just very delicate and wine line and not at all overbearing. if they were really drinking this back way back in the day then they were probably doing pretty well for themselves.

At 9.5% ABV the alcohol is present but well hidden, a warm feeling going down reminds you it's there. Unlike my wife who loves drinking spiced/ herbed beers, I found it hard to drink much of it.

Spices of giner, clove, nutmeg and corriander give the beer an added complexity and compliment the beer well. An earthy, herbal quality persists.

Medium-full body that is heavy and a bit thick and sticky, with a low level of fine, fuzzy carbonation.

While I wouldnt go out of my way to have it again since its not really my scene it is good and worth a try.","lackenhauser","Oct 06, 2006"
4.24,12.5,4,5,4,4,4,"I found this interesting beer to be quite drinkable. It had a very complex yet pleasant taste. A lot of layered fruits. Surprisingly Viognier like. I'm curious as to what grapes were actually used in this. I would certainly recommend this, however don't expect a typical herb/spiced beer. This is a pretty unique creation.","Ieatlambfries","Oct 05, 2006"
3.86,2.4,4,3,4,4,4.5,"M - It is like a mix between champagne and a thick hefeweisen, medium with lots of carbonation.","orsulacp","Oct 02, 2006"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is sweet, fruity, foreign, and different with a starchiness that makes you ponder it upon it's sweetly semi-dry finish.","weeare138","Oct 01, 2006"

4.17,10.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall- A happy surprise. I was not holding out too much hope for this experiment, but I do like an adventure. It is less exotic than I thought it was going to be, but very pleasing nonetheless. I think Midas Touch has the upper hand over the Chateau Jiahu just in level of complexity, but overall they are both fun and drinkable brews.","Malted","Sep 27, 2006"
4.15,10.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Drank mine with some yellow-fin tuna that I had caught just days prior to this review. This would go well with any kind of fish or a sushi meal.","Schwarzbart","Sep 27, 2006"
4.33,14.9,4,3.5,5,4.5,4,"Overall, a nice sweetness balanced with the tart bite and earthiness throughout. It went very well with my dinner of balsamic vinegar peach pork chops. A fine experiment that I hope they keep brewing. The bottle is a bit much for one person though, so I recommend sharing.","weasbri","Sep 23, 2006"
3.4,-9.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability: definitely interesting to try these ancient beer recreations, but not a beer I would buy a bunch of. One is enough to try, and finishing the bottle in one sitting was a slow process.","Gavage","Sep 22, 2006"
4.32,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a very enjoyable brew that captures the imagination and shatters the boundaries of time. The poignant, sensory experience evoked by this libation transcends the effects of great historical texts. I liken this profound discovery to procuring an obscure, long, lost scroll from the very ashes of Alexandria.","Estarrio","Sep 20, 2006"
4.2,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Currently on tap at the Dogfish Head alehouse in Gaithersburg, Maryland. $9 per snifter. The best way I could describe this is a cross between a whitbier and Dogfish Head's own Midas Touch ale. It's a shade lighter than Midas, but it has head (unlike Midas). The spices and slight fruitiness remind me of a whit, but the flavor and feel of the beer is complex and hard to describe, much like Midas Touch. The waiter rattled off a long list of spices that are used in making the beer, none of which I remember. At the finish of the beer is a pleasant little kiss of hops. Very interesting and quite outstanding. Much more drinkable than the aforementioned DFH beer, and possibly the next-best-thing to DFH's red-and-white whitbier, which I never got to try.","chOAKbarrell","Jun 15, 2006"
3.9,3.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability... well, I have to give it a little off for that, since it is a bit strong and expensive. And it had a little more wine character than I would have liked. But it was interesting and worth the experience.","connecticutpoet","Beers"
3.65,-3.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I must say I was a bit skeptical with the first few tastes, but after about the third sip, I was sold. This pairs exceptionally well with their appetizer, "The Dog Pile". This is a beer I would serve with a nice goat cheese, fish, or an aperitif. Due to its dryness it's not something I could drink all night. A very interesting addition to Sam C's ever evolving beer portfolio. Definitely worth a sampling!!","Jaynuze","0"
4.2,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Unique. I wasn't sure I was drinking a beer but a sake infused ale. Almost no head present but a nice pour. A nice smell but definitely overtones of rice? Based on a 5000 year old Chinese recipe the rice/sake taste is to be expected. The mouthfeel was good with flowery tones pervasive to the tongue. The drinkability was very nice. At almost 10% abv you wouldn't expect such drinkability as this but it went down very smootly (too smoothly). Overall, a very nice drink but I still feel that I was drinking a slightly carbonated herbed infused sake-beer. Good job DFH.","ricodewey","Jul 22, 2005"
3.13,-17,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured a hazy straw color. No head at all...maybe a bubble or two but that's it. Barely any smell at all. Slight sweet smell came through as it warmed some as it was served ice cold. The taste was more like a white wine than a beer. Sweet, tart, some grape and woody tones. No carbonation. Thin body with a slick, dry finish. I'm glad I got to try it, but I think I'll stick to "beer" next time I am there.","Imstillthegman","Jun 14, 2005"
3.34,-11.4,3,4,3,4,3,"Served in a 750ml bottle - crown cap - no label.","FoolCircle","Beers"
4.25,12.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"What can you say? This is DFH at its finest. Say what you want about their IPAs, this brewery is built on experimentation -- one of the few that legitimately pushes the boundaries. I don't know if this is a great beer, but it's unique and interesting. That, at least, counts for something.","marburg","0"
