This one is average to slightly better than average and definitely worth trying at least once. I'll probably have one more or even more later in my life.

2.73,0.7,3.25,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.5,"Overall i wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought it was a slightly below average example of the style, it had all the flavors as advertised, but the savory pizza flavors didn't go well in the beer, it doesn't keep me wanting to drink it. This didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention, the pizza spices really started to wear on me and there is no way that I would want to drink multiple bottles of this. What I liked the most about this beer was how close to pizza the flavors was, all the key tastes that I look for in a pizza show up in this beer, it just didn't work out that well. What I liked the least about this beer was the the lingering tomato and spices flavor, it just wouldn't go away. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it might be interesting to try with pizza, but it's not something I'm going to go out of my way to get, but I do recommend trying it, some beers are so unique that they have to be tried once and this beer is one of them. All in all this beer just wasn't for me, in my opinion they nailed what they were going for and it really does taste similar to pizza, it's just those aren't flavors that I really desire in a beer and I don't really have an urge to keep drinking. I appreciate the effort it took to come up with and make this weird brew, but it just wasn't my kind of beer.","StoutHunter","Beers"

3.41,25.8,2.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Okay, so I'm always game to try a gimmick beer. This one is a little stranger than usual...beer made with pizza. The beer itself is a hazy, slightly dark yellow color. No real head after a few seconds. The smell, though, is what fascinated me. It really smells like a pizza. Pizza spice (basil and oregano), pizza crust, and tomato (I'm not sure about the cheese). The pizza is backed by a very slight malt scent, but it mostly smells like a pie. I expected a beer brewed with pizza spice, but this one really surprised me. The flavor has some pizza spice to it, but otherwise is similar to an american all-malt lager beer. Hops are very restrained, and the beer is balanced slightly to the dry side. Finish is quick and the beer is very light in body. This one is very much worth a try, just for the unique flavor.","Suds","Nov 06, 2012"

It pours a lightly hazy orange-amber topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises peppery cantaloupe, light basil, cilantro, dark greens, and lemon zest. It's not very pizza-like, but it's also not all that great-smelling, either. The taste is where the pizza comes in: notes of watered-down tomato juice, basil, plenty of garlic, light biscuit, black pepper, coriander, and a hint of what seems like it could be Swiss cheese. Most of this hits in the front, but then fades away into a sort of spicy melon flavor, complete with rind-y bitterness. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, this beer could have been horrific. Instead, it comes across as muddled, watery, thin, and generally uninspired, despite the cooky idea.","TMoney2591","Aug 25, 2011"

It was nowhere near as pungent as at the Roundhouse. Mouthfeel was medium with the tomato and garlic achieving prevalence on the palate. I know that I going to get dunned for liking this and not Chelada, but this was semi-palatable while the latter was simply awful. NOT recommended for all and certainly NOT with dessert. Calling a spade a spade - it is a novelty beer. Chefs Tom and Athena of the "Original Seefurth Family" probably had it brewed as a lark. Oakle doakle! This was a far cry from a national brand brewing up some Bob-awful crap and foisting it off on an unsuspecting audience. Chelada = Blah! This = Drinkable, but not overly so. I drank it while eating a pizza. I repeat - this is NOT a dessert beer! One with my pizza was just right. Finish was strong with tomato, basil and oregano. Sorry, garlic, but you seemed to get lost in the mix, amazingly. This or the W. P. R. H. version? WPRH. This or wine? Wiine with pizza? Ooof. This or an American IPA with pizza? I have had too many Hop Devils with pizza to make that a question. Mais oui! This was simply a lark of a beer that rates "All 3s" in my book.

Well, this beer definitely smells like pizza just like it says on the label (oregano, basil, tomato and garlic). I don't notice any hop or malt aromas, just pizza. It tastes the same as the aroma, but there's some hops I can taste too. Finishes a bit bitter. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's not watery but there isn't much to the mouthfeel at all. Average carbonation. Drinkability is OK, I guess. I'm pretty sure I couldn't drink more than one bottle of this at a time, though. This is definitely a unique beer, that's for sure.

Along the way, other flavors begin to develop -- some sweetish dough here, some chiffonade basil there. Even a pinch of red pepper spiciness. Oh, and packed with fresh garlic. Ah, the power of garlic. As with any pie, it's more of the same till the end, though the spices still had legs and carried on well past the finish. As you drink it down, the various flavors really start to come together as it slowly bakes in your gut, all of it settling vaguely under the definition of "pizza", at least in terms of flavor and aroma.
