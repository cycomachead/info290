The smell seemed all over the place at first with hints of sage, the tea leaves, and other herbs before I caught the fruits. The taste was very earthy with all of the spices before sweet fruits coming out big near the end. It was very layered and complex and offered interesting insight  to ancient beer flavors. Worth a try although not an every day kind of beer.","WhiteHillsStore","Dec 03, 2014"

Thinking of it as a liquid time capsule allows me to appreciate it to the fullest extent. With no offensive flavors or smell, and a light drinkable body, I am quite pleased with this brew. It has unique flavors I have not experienced before and is quite enjoyable. Instead of "Walk Like an Egyptian" you can now "Drink Like An Egyptian". Perhaps Dogfish should have used that line on the bottle :)","armystrongmd","0"

Grassy and herbal with resinous hops, straw, damp hay and wild bugs followed by floral rose water, sweet malts, light fruit and booze. Somewhat dry, chalky and earthy with sunflower seed oil, caramel malt, toffee and biscuit toward the end of the palate. Some dark and light fruit esters and boozy sweetness as well but there's not much heat. I would have guessed higher than 4.5% but it's still pretty easy to drink. Decent complexity but some of the flavors clash with each other. Not the most flavorful beer but its an interesting experiment and they successfully captured the wild Egyptian yeast. I don't think that I would buy this beer again but I enjoyed drinking it.","corby112","Oct 27, 2013"

Scents of fruit with a lot of sweetness and some apricot notes. A good scent, sweet and fruity. Flavor is light and crisp, slightly sweet, with light apricot and fig notes, and a backbone of grain and wheat cracker with some yeasty bread. The sweetness is balanced by the bready flavors and blends quite well. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Overall it's an excellent beer, and probably the best of the Ancient Ales I've tried.","Auraan","Sep 24, 2013"

If you read the reviews no one really knew what this was supposed to taste like so I recommend trying it anyway. Pours a golden straw color and a nice thick head that doesn’t last very long. Mouthfeel is "syrupy." The more you drink the more you will notice the spices in the beer. No real hops taste in this and it has has low carbonation as well which makes it sweet in a weird way. The fruit ( whatever kind of fruit that was) is noticeable because the flavor of it seems to go very well with those spices. It’s the strangest beer I have had but I’m not sorry I bought it.

With respect to homage, one is trouble on how to define and rate this beer, by authenticity, which is hard to confirm, or by style, herb & spiced, where it is at best average.

Smells like mild chamomille dough with other floral dust ideas. A bit out of the ordinary but not bad. The flavor brings lemon tea and more of the smell theme with ideas of apple and heather and perhaps a touch of muted mint. Again, sort of odd but interesting.

It drinks very light in body. As an ancient recipe, I could see this one being quite.popular and somewhat unique. It has more flavor than English ales.

Must be the za'atar. There is a whisper of something like tuna salad. Smooth texture has slightly above-average body and some good fizz.

There is a mix of spices that I can't quite identify here. It's very light and somewhat saisony, but the spices make it less refreshing than it could be.

3.92,16.3,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in late 2011(first bottling). Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a small 1 finger fairly dense white head with poor retention that reduces to a ring of lacing. Minimal glass lacing, and a slight stream of carbonation coming up. Aromas of chamomile, biscuit, pepper, black tea, lemon, herbs, grass, light citrus, honey, and yeast funk, and spiciness. Very interesting and odd aromas; but I wasn’t sure what to expect. Taste is more pleasant than the aromas: honey, lemon, herbs, chamomile, black tea, grass, licorice, wheat, bread, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of herbs, black tea, wheat, citrus, and spices on the finish for a bit. Nice flavor balance and good complexity. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth mouthfeel. A touch watery feeling, but still has plenty of flavor. No alcohol noticed on the taste or finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is a damn nice ancient ale recreation from Dogfish Head once again. Nice balance and good complexity with easy drinking. They did a great job on this. Definitely enjoyed this one.","superspak","Mar 21, 2012"

After watching their dedication and creativity hard at work, I can truly appreciate getting to finally experience this beer. I'll be honest though, I'm not sure how the Egyptians managed to drink this on a regular basis (I assume).

Honey sweet highlights, along with some floral essences keep the palate light and interesting.

One finger moderate bubble white head that had good retention largely due to the continual carbonation. Earthy herbal aroma, probably due to the za'atar, unidentifiable exotic fruit, which is appropriate, somewhat musky. This is definitely outside the range of standard beer aroma, but it is intriguing. Definitely the most unusual flavored beer I've ever had. Light malt, wheat, oregano or thyme, somewhat nutty, and a hint of citrus; finishes with nutty sweet malt. There is a distinct flavor in the finish that reminded me of something I'd tasted before and it just came to me; a flavor very reminiscent of genmaicha, the toasted rice green tea from Japan. This is very enjoyable, the flavor combination really worked for me. Light to moderate body as expected for the ABV. No one has an absolute idea of what these early proto-beers tasted like, but this is as good a guess as any with interesting regional spices and a definite refreshing quality.

The mouthfeel is fairly light but nicely drying. Overall, an interesting beer that manages to skirt the Dogfish curse of being too sweet. It's probably a touch expensive, but it's a solid experience I'd recommend.","shand","Feb 08, 2012"

Copper orange to yellow in color, decent clarity, hue depth also adequate, like zero bubbles to be seen, kinda just looks like “beer.” The nose is quiet to subtle, brown bread crust, pretzel dough, salt and pepper, orange to lemon reduction, peach, apricot, pear and melon fruit scents, the chamomile comes through clearly, honey and then some cloves but really no one element leaps out at you here. Medium-bodied, more savory than sweet, carbonation is low but still more than you’d expect from visual inspection, salt, pepper, sage, rosemary, metallic flecks and a light pinch of clove and cumin. The chamomile more muted here, however, the orange, lemon, white grapefruit citrus lasts fully throughout. As in the nose, mildly surprising strength in the apricot, peach, apple, melon fruit, nothing too sweet but ripe and consistent. The herbaceous element rises as it warms. As with many one-off beers from this producer it very credibly feels as if it was made according to some exacting ancient recipe.

Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's moderately carbonated and easy enough to drink. I liked this brew more the longer I drank it. It's unusual (which was to be expected), but I thought it was good overall. I'd buy it again. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Dec 30, 2011"

Looks and smells similar to that of a domestic light beer, more over much like the Dfh Pearl Jam beer even a little sweet and yeasty. It's hard to judge the taste of this beer considering I don't know what "doum fruit" "emmer farro" and "za'atar" are supposed to taste like. I certainly haven't picked up on the chamomile. It has a unique taste overall, I get an almost pepper like taste during and aftertaste. sweet fruit, and yeast spice.","JustinMatthew","Dec 26, 2011"

This was something I had been hoping to try since I saw the episode of brewmasters that was about this beer. The beer poured out as a much clearer than expected gold color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer was sweet and had some earthy spice notes on the nose. The taste of this was really interesting to me, I was very pleased with the pepper like flavors I kept getting with every sip. There is a subtle sweetness in there too which I liked. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and had a light body to it. Overall I thought that this beer was a very nice addition to ancient ales the DfH puts out. I have always found these to really spark my interest. I would drink it again for sure!","Knapp85","Dec 25, 2011"
3.82,13.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Comparisons to buckwheat meads come to mind because of the smoky sweet (nearly mesquite) character, but the beer holds back on the richer molasses-like flavor and feel of those meads. Instead a licorice note of fruit and spice accompanies the lighter-than-expected body from mid palate through medium fruity finish.","BEERchitect","Dec 25, 2011"

3.82,13.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear golden color with a slight, white head, that soon disappeared almost completely. After a short waft, I could tell this was going to be a very unique one: scents of wheat bread, grains, a light sweetness, and a certain "I don't know what" that I supposed was attributable to the wild yeast and other unique ingredients--I've never had "Dom palm fruit" so I don't really know what it smells or tastes like, but presumably, that's a big factor here. Very full and in-your-face taste right up front, and the best way I could describe what I experienced was chicken boullion, which I got a strong sensation of up front. After that, flavors of wheat bread, raw grains, raw sugar, and light spice. It was hard at first for me to tell if I actually like the beer or not, because I've really never tasted anything like it. Medium mouthfeel, thick and chewy, considering how light the beer actually looks. Definitely drinkable, but I wouldn't want it in large quantities.","Rifugium","Dec 14, 2011"

Didn't help that there wasn't much malt sweetness - it drank fairly thin and dry. Such criticisms, such conditioned expectations shouldn't apply here, however. This is what I've been waiting for from the Ancient Ales. Something unique, something foreign (and I don't mean Belgium), something that truly stands out and inspires. I wholeheartedly appreciate the effort taken here do create something interesting. Thank you. Can't wait to try it again.","Bouleboubier","Beers"
