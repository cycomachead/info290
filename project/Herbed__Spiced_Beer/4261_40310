It pours a hazy light brown with specs of hops and spices floating around.  The color almost resembles an iced tea.  Right on the first taste, I noticed the crisp brightness.  It is very refreshing and the spices blended work well with the non-filtered brew.  Belgium beers never disappoint, this one is very good.  The 8.5% alc/vol is hidden well with the almost creamy aftertaste, but it warms you nicely.  I would love to drink this outdoors on a cold night.  Overall, I would highly suggest trying this one before the cold weather ends.","JPowell712","Dec 29, 2014"

3.4,-10.1,,,,,,"Bottle. Poured a semi-opaque Amber color with a proud head. Smells neutral. A little sweet, a little spicy. Malt forward; no hops. Maybe a bit medicinal. The first sip did nothing for me. The yeast brings a strong bite. The spices aren't overwhelming by any means but they also make me rear back a bit. The second sip and those following after are mostly more enjoyable. I adjust to the flavor and pick out some nuances. Almost like a spiced bread. It's not overly sweet,mwhich is a plus for my palate. The Belgian aspects of the beer aren't all-encompassing. I like that but I am also a bit confused as to what the thesis of this beer is. It's kinda Belgian, kinda spicy, kinda bland. I don't know. The best part of this one is its body and alcohol masking. The Anne Frank of alcohol. I had no idea; this one shiv'd me with its alcohol content. To finish the story, this one was not a beer I would come back to.","VelvetExtract","Dec 12, 2014"

Anyway, it pours a partly-cloudy sunset bronze-amber topped by a finger or so of off-cream foam. The nose comprises pumpernickel, clove, brown sugar, dark fruits, light candied orange peel, and toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with an increased level of dark fruits, though, make no mistake, the rest (particularly the spices, especially newly-arrived ginger and cinnamon) doesn't fade without a fight. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid spiced Winter brew, if nothing all that special. I'd certainly have another, though.","TMoney2591","Aug 17, 2013"

4.1,8.5,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a brandy snifter. The beer pours dark hazy copper with a finger and a half length off-white head. There are bubbles visible rising along the side of the glass. There are malty aromas as well as some scent of toffee, fruit, and some spice. The fruity aroma is akin to plum and fig. The spice notes are mostly coriander. The flavors are of bready pilsner malt with a stronger spice note in the flavor than in the nose. The coriander comes out, but I also get some hints of pepper, orange peel, and anise that other reviewers picked out. The sweetness is pretty balanced out with the abundant spice bouquet in this beer. The fruity notes come out a little stronger as the beer warms. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the alcohol provides a nice warming quality. Not much of the aftertaste lingers in this beer, allowing a stronger drinkability for this beer.

Color was a deep coppery-red with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had a vinous grape-y quality up front along with the chewing tobacco sweetness mentioned by the previous reviewer. Mouthfeel was very full, with a lot of huge carbonic bubbles leading the way. The taste was unique, a blend of raisin, bourbon, tobacco, and lemon zest. Frankly, it was like a cocktail more than a beer. Oh, those crazy Belgians and the crazier Shelton Brothers for importing such beers. Finish combined the lemon zestiness with the vinous quality of the nose for a dryness that would have put many martinis to shame. Phew! This begged for an H2O chaser, I'll tell you.

Beer itself was cloudy dark amber to medium blonde color around the edge when held to light. Could not see much carbonation from side of goblet, but top of beer showed signs of medium fizz action. First scent was lightly astringent and bready. Also detected slightly burnt sugary notes. Other scents detected were light caramel, malt, barley, mild orange, apple, and raisins.
