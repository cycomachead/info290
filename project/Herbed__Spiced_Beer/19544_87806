The honey comes forth in this beer more so than any other beer I have had, maybe even as much as DFH Midas Touch. The ginger seems to help that perception, as does the rich malt.

3.9,2.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/24/2013. Pours moderately cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, honey, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, clove, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, honey, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander, clove, and herbal earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, honey, ginger, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, honey, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced Christmas ale! All around good balance and complexity of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 04, 2014"

Aroma has spices for Christmas, ginger, cinnamon, etc. with a definite honey tone fermented out a bit. Strong spice character throughout each sip it's super spicy limiting the enjoyment of each sip, to how high your tolerance is to the honey, cinnamon, ginger, dry spice additions are. Mouthfeel gets cloying at times be ready to share this beer with those folks who love Great Lakes Christmas ale hell rim the glass with a mix of cinnamon and sugar if you have to. Overall I love Fathead's this beer is off my palate's radar for beers I truly love, but I consider it to be a good solid Christmas ale.","WVbeergeek","0"

Taste is sweet, with cinnamon up front and the other spices following. Honey is in there somewhere. I like this as a holiday ale, but am not overwhelmed by it.

Here in Ohio, it’s not a threat to dethrone Great Lakes Christmas Ale, but it’s a nice supplement to the Christmas season. If the strong sprucey, piney flavor could be toned down a little, it’d be even better. Easy recommendation nevertheless.","prototypic","Feb 27, 2013"

Not because I don't like it. I simply prefer Great Lakes Christmas Ale. It's a little sweeter than this one and feels a bit more festive somehow. Perhaps it's the label on the bottle.","deadonhisfeet","Dec 29, 2012"

In the taste, spices, especially all spice, but mellow in the end. A spice bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice in the aftertaste. Nice spice but mellow and faint.","OWSLEY069","Beers"

Hops are minor, fruits are mixed in with added sugars. Ginger makes up the main flavor with the buttery malts. Good, not great, worth a drink.","wvsabbath","Dec 19, 2012"
