So this is apparently an actually beer brewed with flavor added. Is it a Mike's Hard sort of scenario? I truly do not know. The beer pours dark, clear brown. Looks like root beer. The smell is goddamn root beer. I'm not going to describe specifics; its root beer, bro. Sweet Christ, it's root beer in the tongue! The only difference between this and a Barq's is a touch of alcohol after each sip. Very sugary and bubbly. Actually made my cheeks flush. This is beer? Is it? Does it taste good because it tastes like root beer? I'm confused, again. I'm not the biggest root beer guy anyway but hell, they nailed it.","VelvetExtract","Friday at 10:26 AM"

Smells similar to Dad's root beer initially with that distinctive root beer spice, but then opens up with artificial caramel and a weird take on root beer bottle caps.  It tastes like the smell of an overheating vacuum and cheap whiskey with a hint of burnt sugar.  I'm talking about a pot of sugar left on the stove way too long after some one's first attempt at making caramel.  The cheap whiskey flavor isn't the only alcohol flavor present by no means!  The aftertaste tastes like off-brand cough syrup with black licorice lit on fire with a blow torch.  Biggest disappointment in awhile.  After this and the abysmal Sprecher's hard root beer, I am convinced alcohol ruins root beer.

Then there's that cough syrup aftertaste that just bothers me plus there's not as much carbonation as in actual root beer.

Looks like a carbonated dark brown pop/soda. Very little ale like qualities to the appearance. Smells like a high quality craft root beer. also it tastes like a great root beer, more like a traditional soda pop and not an ale or stout. Beyond that I really don't have much to say about this brew other than that it is a tasty gimmick, not really an ale or stout.","EricTKole","Dec 29, 2014"

The taste brings in more of the same, the sweet and spicy nature of root beer shining throughout.  Unlike the higher ABV versions, there isn't even the slightest twinge of booze.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel.  Overall, this is damn tasty.  Straight up.","TMoney2591","Dec 20, 2014"

I don't understand the wizardry involved and maybe it's best I leave it a mystery. All I know is I'm now seeking out all variations and can't wait to try this again.","phishbfm","Nov 10, 2014"
