"By the way, don't buy it. It's the same price as other, better ones. If it came down to the aqua blue and draft one, I would have to recommend the Aqua Blue, because at least it isn't foul."
"drinkability is pretty bad. having trouble getting through my half of the can. no depth. no balance. no redeeming qualities. more offensive than water and about as interesting."
"Pours a crystal clear greenish tinged yellow, almost like pond scum mixed with urine, thin bubbly white head forms, instantly settles to nothing, few bubbles come up. Smell is pretty vile, very sweet and corny, rice, light floral, grassy, apple cider, weird beany aroma, don't know whats going on here. Taste is like a lightly flavoured water beverage, lightly sweet and sugary, grassy, lightly fruity, really weird, rice, I think my tongue is going numb. Mouthfeel is very weak, light bodied, sparkling carbonation. Not sure why anyone would drink this, but worth the experience! Thanks Robbo!"
"Bizarre game shows, karaoke, raw seafood and now Happoshu - there is a lot about modern Japanese culture I just don't understand. Whatever ""neo-alcohol culture"" Sapporo claims this ""nationwide hot-selling product"" to have created I don't really care to be part of it. That said, I was happy to be able to check it out. A huge 'domo arigato' to Bobsy!"
"avoid!"
"Overall, it's an extremely boring ""beer"" with nothing to recommend it. It's fine if you want a thirst-quencher with alcohol in it, and have no money to get anything better. It's cheap. I'll give it that."
"I cannot see why this is so popular, except for the fact that it is less than half the price of all malt beer."
"Very cheap for japanese standards and utilizing a type of green bean, this beer gets points for being interesting."
