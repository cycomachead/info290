"D - This is my second favorite cheap Japanese happoshu. It's perfect for a third string beer. It's also easy to find at most Japanese convenient stores and super markets. I would rate this higher than many Euro pale lagers, and way higher than macro-American adjunct lagers. At the same time it manages to be a step or two above many of it's local competitors in this price class. Please remember this only gets a score this high by being good for a happoshu. Most are not."
