2.09,0,,,,,,"BB 2006.04. Nice but dissappearing quiet rapid white head and a golden beer that's clear. Nose is buttery, litle maltyness like, some alcohol and very low dosed yeast esters. Overall empty and buttery reminding a lot of fat oxidation. Taste is hard to dig also being extremly oxidated annd watery, hardly any taste and even less beery notes, no body and no bitterness. Something far off from beer at all and wonder if there is malt in this at all.","paterlodie","Beers"
