2.79,0,,,,,,"At first it smells skunky. Looks like old apple juice. Doesn't retain a head. But, it's light and unoffensive, I enjoy it. Lighten up, internet beer reviewers.","Strakosch","Mar 03, 2012"

2.81,0,,,,,,"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a smallish bone white head and a persistent stream of carbonation bubbles floating to the surface. Initially smells of corn and skunk when I crack the can, but that subsides after the brew hits the glass. Bready pilsner malt dominate the aroma with a bit of earthy I guess its rice, but my nose finds a light corn aroma. Taste is lightly metallic with sweet almost honey like flavors. Spirited level of carbonation light body with a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. I'm glad I got to try this, but this is the last and probably my least favorite of the brews I got from Japan.","johnnnniee","Jun 15, 2009"
