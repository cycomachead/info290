"'Honkaku Karakuchi Mugi' apparently translates to 'dry tasting wheat', and thus Kirin pretty much nails it. Given that there is a perceptible wheat character, and no off-putting flavours, it's easy to see this being quite popular, given its presentation, price-friendly tax status, and full booze strength."
