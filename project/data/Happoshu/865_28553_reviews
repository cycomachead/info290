"I knew I had tried this style before but forgot which one until I saw this and even had a picture to along with it, they sold six packs of this stuff at the local grocery store I believe, one of the weirder beers I had over there, probably will never drink again but not too worried about it, probably better examples of this style but who knows"
"Smells like nothing, which is positive for the style. Taste is mildly sweet and impressively neutral with a touch of something chemical-like and artificial in the aftertaste, which seems to be unavoidable in these no-malt brews. Ug. Wildly overcarbonated."
"D - Went OK with food, bu once the grub was gone, there was definately no desire to drink this. I guess this is just a poor substitute for water."
"and that's about all i can say about suntory's jokki, it's not terrible. very average for the style, it has no smell or taste to speak of. think watered down bud."
