"O boy, another new beer to try here in Tokyo. Poured from a 11.2 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts. Taste is malty, slightly sweet, refreshing and easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while nothing special, is a servicable beer."

"O: Nothing really wrong with it, and better than the Japanese rice lagers that I have had thus far. Would be interested in trying more in the style actually, to see if there are any major differences, though I doubt it."
"O: Excellent water beer. I wish this was commonly available here, very easy to drink with dinner or whenever."
"Well, this seems very much like a pretty plain, inoffensive lager, and quite easy to put back, which I suppose is the whole point. If the malt bill is that much lower than actual beer, I'd be curious to know what all those much thinner, skunkier 'real' beers out there have going on under the hood."
