This is almost at Wild Blue level hangover-in-a-glass sweet. Ok, not quite that bad. But I will be damn impressed if you can finish a whole bottle of this. A experiment, but the results are pretty regrettable. Avoid, my friends.","notchucknorris","Jan 19, 2015"

The flavors and aromas are only a step up from par, but it's far from bad. And as an ingredient in the popular variety of sake, shochu, the sweet potato contributes an interesting Japanese twist.","The_Mad_Capper","Nov 15, 2014"

3.45,1.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Starts off with a minimal head presence, deep amber/brown color that is fairly translucent. Appears to be filtered and shows minimal visual carbonation. Quite a toasty nose to it, with caramel and cherries on first taste. Quite a clean mouth feel here, notes of honey emerging over time and I find this quite a tasty beer. Surprisingly, this seems to me quite different than the first time I tried it--lighter, fruitier and generally more exciting. Some alcohol emerges towards the end of the glass, along with a more distinctive sweet potato flavor, but neither of these take the beer out of balance. I certainly enjoyed this more than the last time I had it, and look forward to having it again.","solid98","Dec 15, 2012"

3.12,-8.2,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear dark copper color with a fizzy 1/2 inch tan head that quickly fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly slide into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain, caramel, and some slight sweet potato and vegetal aromas. Taste is very sweet and is of grain, caramel, and burnt sweet potato/vegetal flavors. There is a weird herbal/medicinal bitterness that lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with only a very slight crispness. Overall, this is a very interesting beer. It tastes better than it smells but the aftertaste has a very odd burnt vegetable flavor that is kind of gross.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 10, 2012"
3.89,14.4,3.5,4.5,3.75,4,3.5,"Bought a bottle of this from the Maruhiro department store in Saitama, Japan. Poured into a Suntory Premium Malts modest tulip glass. Creates a wonderful yellow custard hued head and releases a noticeable fragrant aroma of hops and sugar. This beer is partially made from sweet potato, so that sugary flavor definitely comes out (in a pleasant way) that almost seems chocolatey. With a relatively strong ABV and a sweet aftertaste, this is a great after-dinner brew. On the same note, I wouldn't probably have this with a meal, but definitely went well with the strawberries I was eating at the same time. This is my favorite of the Coedo brewery, and I would recommend it as a regular beer if you can find it.","shigg85","Oct 02, 2011"
