4.02,0,,,,,,"[Note: While previous fall seasonal offerings from Suntory have generally been happoshu (primarily in that they contained less than 25% malted barley in order to fall into a cheaper bracket in the Japanese alcohol tax code), Akiraku is actually classified in the increasingly popular, though horrifically bad, “ Liqueur (carbonated type) #1” category (I guess this is what happens when you have tax accountants/bureaucrats coming up with names to categorize alcoholic beverages). These drinks fall into a tax category even cheaper than happoshu and are beverages that are essentially happoshu to which have been added a mixture of grain alcohol derived from barley or wheat and a little bit of carbonated gas.]","pettis","0"
