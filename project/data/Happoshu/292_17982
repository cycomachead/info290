3.05,12.1,2.75,3.25,3,3,3,"It's a light body for sure, and runs a touch thin, but I have to assume that, since it holds up a good crispness, keeps pretty clean and without any grainy astringency, and has at least a modicum of smoothness, it's pretty good for the style though not overall.","Brenden","Jul 12, 2014"

2.48,-8.8,3,2.5,2.25,3,2.5,"Yay, another Japanese beer to review. Poured from an 11.2 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is virtually nothing, a faint hint of malts. Taste is light, bland and boring. Some malts, an unusual aftertaste. Feels light in the mouth and overall is not an enjoyable beer.","tone77","0"

3.16,16.2,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a crystal clear pale golden color with a huge fluffy white head that shows moderate retention and some lace. Smells grainy and a bit sweet with malt. Smells like a PBR if you asked me. Taste is a bit sweet with a grainy malt edge, light pomme fruit, floral hops provide enough balance, but leave little flavor behind. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Very clean, nothing objectionable here, but nothing exciting either. If I had a hankering for some pale lager and I was in Japan I might reach for one of these, but its certainly nothing I would go out of my way for.","johnnnniee","Nov 24, 2011"

3.25,19.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"*[As mentioned in the style summary for ""happoshu," this isn't so much a clear ""style"" as a separate alcohol tax category created by the Japanese government for malt beverages with less than 67% malted barley content or that contain adjuncts beyond those stipulated in the tax code (this includes rice and corn but not, for example, coriander--thus many imported Belgian witbiers are legally classed as ""happoshu""). Major brewers began producing these low-malt ""rice lagers"" when the tax on legally define beer was raised, thus creating a market for happoshu as a cheaper substitute. The biggest-selling happoshu varieties actually contain less than 25% malt, since this places them in the cheapest of the three ""happoshu"" tax brackets.]","pettis","Jul 24, 2011"

3.18,16.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"O - Let's not kid ourselves here, for what this beer is, to style, it's really not bad overall. It's not much different from any other malt liquor out there. Not truly offensive, just bland.","BeerFMAndy","Apr 27, 2011"
2.44,-10.3,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O - Pretty bland and non-distinct. Side by side with any number of Japanese beers...I'd be hard pressed to pick this one out. It has its place as a clean, easy drinker...and probably would complement a sushi dinner, but as a standalone drink, it is lacking a lot of character.","portia99","Feb 23, 2011"

3.33,22.4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Taste is extremely light, but very clean. Dry finish makes it disappear on the palate almost before it arrives. This makes the alcohol more noticeable than a 5.5% beer has a right to. Decent bitterness is surprising. Overall, Id say this is at least as enjoyable as an AAL, and with the different tax bracket, I would probably drink my fair share were I to find myself in the land of the rising sun.","twiggamortis420","Dec 03, 2010"
2.16,-20.6,3,2,2,3,2,"D- Overall, pretty boring and nothing really going on here. Reminded me of quite a few macros here. Probably something that I wouldn't seek out again, but glad I got to try it.","nrbw23","Nov 30, 2010"
2.37,-12.9,4,2,2.5,2.5,2,"D: This being the first time I have ever tasted a happoshu, I was thrilled at the opportunity to indulge in this very elusive beer style. While it was very cool from an experience standpoint, the beer itself wasn't that enjoyable.","Huhzubendah","Nov 28, 2010"
1.83,-32.7,4,3.5,1,1.5,1,"The flavor goes way downhill. Any fruity note is gone and all that remains is a bunch of rice and a lot of grain husks. The mouthfeel is quite thin and watery.

3.13,15.1,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"And I finally get to try a happoshu! Victory...I guess... In the boot, the pour results in what looks like a Wolverine workboot with a stark white sock sticking out of it. The nose comprises light corn syrup, rice, and a combination of air and glass (though that last one may have just been the boot...). The taste is pretty much the same, though some flowers and a slight sweetness help out a bit...just not much. The body is quite light, with a light carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, an interesting brew, ridiculously easy to drink, but not much goin' on in the smell/taste department.","TMoney2591","Beers"

2.34,-14,3.5,2,2,2.5,3,"This beer is something I was warned about in advance, but I must taste it to learn more about it. It appears to me as a pale golden straw with a frothy white head. The smell wasn't kind to me at all. There is a bit of sour rice mixed with some body odor as if sweat from Japanese laborers was used in the canning of this product. The taste isn't really all that good either. It reminds of old apple cores, but is not really all too bad. It's just really not a flavor that is desirable. The mouthfeel is rather dry for my liking, I'm unsure if that is to the style, but it's not pleasant due to my cottonmouth. This drinks ok, not really all that bad, but I really am okay with these beers staying in Japan.","Vdubb86","Nov 23, 2010"
2.58,-5.1,3,2.5,2,3,3.5,"Another not very impressive happoshu, but I guess it's fine for what it is. I have to give it to this one though: Like the labe states, it is a pretty good pairing for good times. An extra half-point for that. I like good times, don't you?","nickd717","Nov 20, 2010"
3,10.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Clear, pale, yellow. The thin head quickly retreats. Smells like apple juice, rice, lager yeast. Palate is grainy, thin, distinct apple character with a touch of lemon. Mild bitterness in the finish. Not particularly bad, this is refreshing and clean.","largadeer","Jul 29, 2010"
3.7,36,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"D: it drank really really good due to how light it was in body and flavor but will definitely be tasty paired with sushi or sashimi. I would like to try some happoshu with some japanese food one day for sure.","Gobzilla","Jun 13, 2010"
2.8,2.9,3,3,2.5,3,3,"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strong corn with some rice and grain. The flavor is very sweet corn with some grain and grass notes as well. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, this tastes about like an American Adjunct Lager, only sweeter.","Mora2000","May 18, 2010"

3.83,40.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,5,"Overall, I prefer Sparkling Hop but apparently it is no more. This one is still good though and makes me wish I could get it in the US.","mullenite","Oct 05, 2009"
2.88,5.9,3,2.5,3,3,3,"I brought back a few cans of this from Japan, basically to try a happoshu and give others in the States a chance to try the style. As so often happens with beer from Japan, the can kicks things off in style: ""Sheer refreshment! Open up the smooth taste that goes perfectly with good times"". The beer is clear, golden colored, with a thin spitty foam. Looks like a macro, about as I expected. The smell is really mild, really neutral, no hops, kind of an off aroma of sourness. Likewise, the taste is neutral but manages to be a tad offensive despite that, I think I'd honestly prefer a Budweiser. It must be tough to make a tasty beer that can still earn the happoshu tax classification, and it also must be tough to need to save money so badly as to buy this instead of any other beer. There are plenty of decent beers in Japan (Yebisu comes to mind), and life is seriously too short to drink happoshu.","TurdFurgison","Sep 22, 2008"
2.85,4.8,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"D - Drinkability is not too bad for the Tanrei. It's light and provides at least some legitimate refreshment. Kind of like an American Adjunct Lager with a little more flavor. Seems like this beer was intended for mass consumption. Moderate alcohol and mild flavors add to that idea. Along with the style description that gives it a ""cheap beer alternative"" moniker. Overall, really stoked that I got to try the style out. Probably wouldn't be something I'd seek out again.","csmiley","Sep 09, 2008"
2.92,7.4,2,2.5,3,2,4,"Worth a try if you're enduring a humid Japanese summer. Not at all worth drinking if there's a microbrewery near you that produces some kind of cold summer ale or lager.","Weizenmensch","Dec 01, 2007"
