3.5,0,,,,,,"Pours a clear light golden color with a white head. Nose is fruity with quite a bit of melon. Some sweet malt and rice notes, maybe a light citrus zest and vegetable aroma. The flavor is fruity and slightly sweet with a bitter finish. Definitely a strong rice flavor and somewhat dry. A little disappointing.","womencantsail","Jul 28, 2006"
