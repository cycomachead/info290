"Drinkablity: Alright, but nothing too special. I would not go too far for this one."
"mouthfeel and drinkability are average but this is really bitter for the style, so i like it."
"D - This is one of the better happoshu's I have had. Please note that the high ratings this beer received was because I was rating it within style. Against a Jever, or even a Pilsner Urquell, it would likely get straight 2."
