3.37,0,,,,,,"Nice dark brown body is let down by a rapidly fading off-white head. Sweet malty aroma, with some mild nut and caramel flavours going on. Taste has some cocoa and caramel sweetness and a touch of leafy hops. Fairly soft in the mouth, and with a refreshing crispness from the steady stream of bubbles. Light body and medium-high carbonation.","bobsy","Feb 04, 2008"
2.68,0,,,,,,"In taste terms, this one is reminiscent of a classic British Mild. But even though it is called Kuro (Black), it is not - its more like a very dark brown, as you'd see when you get near the end of the glass. Its nothing like a stout or porter, and is sweet, though not off-puttingly so, and carries a hint of caramel. Its 6%, and being used to Milds, I'd have guessed it was more like 3.6 % !!!","alebuff","May 26, 2007"
2.86,0,,,,,,"The big problem is that ""kuro"" is synonymous with stout, so a drinker looking for a creative low-malt take on stout will be very disappointed by the fact that this is ""usui"" like any other happoshu.","saztheorybook","Beers"
3.7,0,,,,,,"The taste is not so hot. Brings me back to earth, oh yeah, this is happoshu. But a pretty good one. Again, like the regular Enjuku, it's got a nice all around flavor, highly drinkable. Believe the hype! Check it out. We may have a winner here, best cheap ""beer"" in Japan.","davidchollar","0"
