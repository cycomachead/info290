"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but not really that enjoyable. A bit too simple and conservative, it tastes almost as if they were hesitant to put more than a drop of miso, just in case it turned people off. If it wasn't for this unusual ingredient, then it would be bland and uninspiring."

"Nice med-high carbonation suits the beer well."
"D- This beer was interesting as even though there wasn't a lot going on flavorwise at times it was still a very enjoyable beer. I would like to try some more of this style when I get a chance as it was actually quite good. The ABV is low enough to enjoy a sixer of this which I could do. Almost seems like a upgraded lawn mower beer."
"This'd probably go real nicely with Japanese or any not-particularly-spicy Asian food, and it's certainly easy to drink on it's own. It's damn expensive over here though, and I don't like it enough for another go 'round."
"this really reminds me of a dopplebock. that was part of the smell that i couldn't quite place. as i taste it, my first thought is doppelbock. it has a really strong malty flavor, with a big bitter finish. oh my god, this beer has tons of character. loads of flavor, highly drinkable. recommended!"
"Overall, an intriguing choice. A tasty, nearly flat, dark beer in a land of over-carbonated light-yellow beer-pops. Well worth a try."
"D - This is a pleasant beer. I imagine that they might make more sales of this beer if they made it more extreme and gimmicky, but I am glad they settled for a tasty beer instead."
