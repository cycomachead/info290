2.64,24.5,3,2.75,2.5,3,2.5,"I don't know why it's listed as retired. Is not hard to find in Tokyo. Poured from an 11.2 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a light touch of malts. taste is weak, bland, some very light malts, greatly lacking in flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is nothing worth seeking out.","tone77","Jun 03, 2012"

2.47,16.5,4,2,2,1.5,4,"This beer looks very good, but as a light Japanese beer, it is indeed light and lacking in what one expects of one's beer. However, it's a nice golden, sunflower color, and it is extraordinarily easy to drink. Not bad for a light ""happoshu"". The green label also makes me happy.","donnebaby","0"
