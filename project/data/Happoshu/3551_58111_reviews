"O: Impressive idea, love that Japan is getting more creative in craft beer.  Got this on Wishbeer, drank in Chiang Mai March 9th, 2015."

"T: And now we're off. We're way the hell off. This lager body with a base that tastes like MGD. Then a crapload of candied sweet potato sweetness. This is almost at Wild Blue level hangover-in-a-glass sweet. Ok, not quite that bad. But I will be damn impressed if you can finish a whole bottle of this. A experiment, but the results are pretty regrettable. Avoid, my friends."

"Overall: an interesting but overall awkward beer. I'm not entirely sure the flavour is something that feels right being added to a beer. The biggest issue is the price however, at AU$8.50 per 333mL bottle. Not worth that - nowhere near it."
"Flavorful with a visually appealing hue, this is a rather welcome variation on an otherwise unremarkable style. The flavors and aromas are only a step up from par, but it's far from bad. And as an ingredient in the popular variety of sake, shochu, the sweet potato contributes an interesting Japanese twist."

"Did not expect this, for my first Happoshu (first sweet potato beer too). Expected some kind of bland earthy/veggie beer with weird maltiness, got a really nice tasty ale instead. Nice."
"Having said all that it is unique, with malt overload and sweet hit, I haven't had anything like it before."
""
"O: A mildly sweet, boozy, and interesting style. First for me."
""
""
"Maybe there are better Happoshu beers out there, but from how little seems to be out there, probably not. Then again, I've never been to Japan."

"The most interesting thing, is I thought this was going to be an alcohol malt liquor sugar bomb but it's actually well hidden and drinks real easily. Most of the happoshu I've heard about is a canned cheap swill beverage, but this is a little different even if it's not really looking that appealing."
""
"O-I think this ""beer"" is interesting, but woulnd't seek it out again. It has cellared well for 7 months, fwiw; seems my review matches up well with most of the others here."

"best beer from Coedo I've had. beautiful copper brown appearance, but like most of their beers, a very watery texture, very flat, and zero head. The pour is fairly exciting, but the head is very very temporary. They have copied the Chimay packaging, it seems like. i enjoy the taste and appearance, and the smell and taste of the fruit and caramel is great, but the body is just too thin. Wouldn't recommend it."

""
"Actually quite decent despite the adjunct aroma and flavors in there."

"Food match: it's a bit of a given - Japanese beer = Japanese food, so I'll refrain from the obvious. What I will say is that I could see this pairing well with a good old fashioned American Thanksgiving dinner replete with turkey, mashed yams, cranberry sauce, corn and the obligatory pumpkin pie slice for dessert."

"Body feels a bit flat, need a lot more carbonation to cut the sweetness."
"Starts off with a minimal head presence, deep amber/brown color that is fairly translucent. Appears to be filtered and shows minimal visual carbonation. Quite a toasty nose to it, with caramel and cherries on first taste. Quite a clean mouth feel here, notes of honey emerging over time and I find this quite a tasty beer. Surprisingly, this seems to me quite different than the first time I tried it--lighter, fruitier and generally more exciting. Some alcohol emerges towards the end of the glass, along with a more distinctive sweet potato flavor, but neither of these take the beer out of balance. I certainly enjoyed this more than the last time I had it, and look forward to having it again."

"Bottle thanks to drabmuh. Served in a taster glass. Pours an orange-copper color with a tiny head of bubbles that falls quickly. The nose has some sweet potato and a touch of caramel. Flavor starts off with caramel, sweet potato, and bread, but then is taken over by a strange off dryness. Very odd. Body is light and off kilter. Not a big fan."
""
""
""
"The beer is amber colored with no head or lacing. The aroma is sweet, offering brown bread, biscuits, caramel, grain. Smells like a sweet adjunct lager. Malt, sweet potato and sweet breads. Virtually no carbonation leads to a light, watery feel on the palate. Overall, this was fun to try but not something I would have again."
""
"Pours a clear amber red with no head. Very sweet aroma; bready and caramel, light vegetable. Smooth body with low carbonation, medium thick. Interesting flavor, sweet and malty, with a subtle contribution from the sweet potato. Sweet, but drinkable, I'd bizarrely like to have more of this."
"Drinkable, but unexciting. It's nothing I'll revisit."
"Beer is medium in body, sweet finish, a little malty, a decent beer, by far the best happoshu I've ever had."
""
"O: A very elusive style that I am psyched I found and tried, the use of non-corn/grain/rice as the adjunct malts definitely makes it a unique experience. I very much enjoyed the beer and felt it easy to drink, one you could have many of in a session. Matches well with sushi. Some definite complexity to the aroma and flavor. I would get this one again."
"O: This beer style is definitely unique and sweet potato is more interesting as an adjunct malt compared to corn and rice. It definitely tastes a lot more flavorful compared to Japanese rice lagers."
"Pours a clear dark copper color with a fizzy 1/2 inch tan head that quickly fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly slide into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain, caramel, and some slight sweet potato and vegetal aromas. Taste is very sweet and is of grain, caramel, and burnt sweet potato/vegetal flavors. There is a weird herbal/medicinal bitterness that lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with only a very slight crispness. Overall, this is a very interesting beer. It tastes better than it smells but the aftertaste has a very odd burnt vegetable flavor that is kind of gross."
"Bought a bottle of this from the Maruhiro department store in Saitama, Japan. Poured into a Suntory Premium Malts modest tulip glass. Creates a wonderful yellow custard hued head and releases a noticeable fragrant aroma of hops and sugar. This beer is partially made from sweet potato, so that sugary flavor definitely comes out (in a pleasant way) that almost seems chocolatey. With a relatively strong ABV and a sweet aftertaste, this is a great after-dinner brew. On the same note, I wouldn't probably have this with a meal, but definitely went well with the strawberries I was eating at the same time. This is my favorite of the Coedo brewery, and I would recommend it as a regular beer if you can find it."
""
"The color is a beautiful amber and I picked up sweet, sake-like aromas. The alcohol is 7% here. I'd have liked a little more bitterness in the finish, more hops would balance the fruity qualities from the sweet potatoes. Try bringing this unique beer to a Thanksgiving dinner, it should fit right in."
"O-The best I've had from Coedo. Wish it had a little more going for it other than the sweet potato."
"O - Quite an unusual brew, and very enjoyable, I would definitely have another one"
"Overall, pretty easy to drink and worth a try. Drinkable, but not your typical beer profile. Good to try as a curiosity."
"I was hoping this beer would be much more interesting but it really wasn't anything to brag about. It had a reddish color which was nice but no head which always bums me out. The brew had a sweet aroma to it. Not much in there that made it super appealing on any level. This had a strong abv but that's about all I could really say about it."
"Drinkability: Really a different beer and one you probably have to be in the mood for. Not bad, but not great either. Worth trying."
"Drinkability: I'm surprised by this unique and tasty brew. It's only 25% malt, according to the Coedo website, but it manages to have a lot of character despite this. Good stuff!"
"This lack of balance really hurts the drinkability. Normally I don't like to waste beer, but in this case I was actually tempted to just pour it down the drain and be done with it. Coedo produces some very good beers, which makes this one all the more disappointing."
"This is a Japanese Sweet Potato beer. Poured a dark brown into a pint glass. Light smell of sweetness. The taste is sweet with a slight potato flavor. Mouthfeel has a mellow roasty taste. Drinkability is decent,not overwhelming. This is a decent beer with a sweet backend. The sweet potato flavor is not overwhelming."
