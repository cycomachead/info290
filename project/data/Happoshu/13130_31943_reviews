"It's not incredibly unusual for Japanese beers, but it's very drinkable, with everything well balanced and spot on for a satisfying summer afternoon beer."
"Overall I'm excited to say this beer has character as well as it tastes just like the Okinawan vegetable on the can. Is it good, maybe, was it worth a try, absolutely."

"Pours a clear light golden color with a white head. Nose is fruity with quite a bit of melon. Some sweet malt and rice notes, maybe a light citrus zest and vegetable aroma. The flavor is fruity and slightly sweet with a bitter finish. Definitely a strong rice flavor and somewhat dry. A little disappointing."
"Drinkability: Few beers this light on the palate are this interesting and tasty, making this exceptionally drinkable. I need to get my ass to Okinawa."
"D - Surprisingly good, easy drinking. I thought this would be a gimmicky beer, but instead its a great beer."
