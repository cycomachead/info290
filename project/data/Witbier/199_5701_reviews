"Excellent white beer. Smell and taste good."
"The feel of this beer is light bodied and pretty darn drinkable and pretty pleasant. The smooth body goes down easy and really makes for a refreshing beer."
"2.83/5: Wahoos aren't as cool as sculpins"

"Was the variety pack skunked? That's what I thought. This and the yellowtail pale were some of the least appealing beers I've had from a reputable brewery in a while. However the sculpin in the case was its usual sculpinrific self. All this beer did was make me drink it as fast as possible to get it over with. Citrus? As in a tablespoon of frozen orange juice conventrate in a gallon of water. BLUE MOON has more flavor and complexity. Granted maybe this style is more susceptible to mishandling on the voyage from CA to PA than Sculpin...or it was a bad batch. Only way I'd try it again would be if someone handed it to me....on draft.....at the brewery.....in a sample glass. Not a fan of the new label. Sculpin rules! Wahoo drools!"

"Refreshing and drinkable, but a bit on the mild side and not my typical style of choice. Nonetheless, worth checking out if you enjoy wits."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum. Aside from there being no head or lacing whatever the flavor and body are great. Nice citrus taste with substantial mouthfeel made me order a second. The lack of aroma had me concerned but it came through in the end. Just the thing with light summers lunch."

"Pours clear and pale gold with a white head. A relatively quick fade leave a bit of lace. Smell lovely with melon and light bubble gum notes. A light bit of wheat and yeast. Taste is bang on with a wheat graininess and Belgian wit level of of fruitiness. A touch of hefe like banana and clove subtly flowing. Bubble gum with sweet light malt. Finish is crisp and mild characterized by a lemony zestiness. Smooth carbonation and lighter body make this a superb summer quaffer. This is the ultimate lawn mower beer and stands head and shoulders above the usual fare. Low abv makes this a no brainer when you are busy and thirsty."

"Overall - Rather weak and bland. Super easy to drink but minimal flavors, combined with the expensive price tag, this is nothing id ever buy again, nor really care to drink again."

"Overall, a decent light wheat beer, but not the best."

"Overall: @ 4%, you really cannot expect much from this beer without the addition of orange perl and coriander. Very sessionable, but lacking flavor."

"This is New Years Eve 2013 drinking the Wahoo along side Firestone Double Jack and Sam Adams Third Voyage. I should say my wife is drinking the Wahoo, had a glass to review it. Pours delightfully light....head non existence...lacing? Refreshing light, balanced. Aroma ....Florida orange groves...no not that strong..maybe orange furniture polish after about an hour. Nice light brew ...refreshing ...Hop Heads stand down...this one is for the other 90 percent. Cheers"

"Ideally suited to a hot day. Overall just okay. I would drink it again, but probably wouldn't purchase it."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a yellowish/white color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, wheat, a bit of citrus. Taste is coriander, wheat, some citrus, very easy drinking but not the most flavorful wit out there. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/25/2013. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, banana, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, banana, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light bready tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, banana, pear, coriander, clove, wheat, pepper, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; with a good amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice witbier. Very nice balance of malt. spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall though a real solid witbier, I'd have this again easily."
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of wheat with a hint of orange thrown in. I also get a little vanilla in the aroma, which was unexpected. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of wheat notes, as well as a hint of coriander. The orange notes from the aroma don't really come through in the flavor. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Nice wit with loads of lemon and creme and a bit of stank. 4.0"
""
"O: Very well put together brew. All the typical flavors are represented. Have to say it has less spice then most of the witbiers i've had but their absence is not missed here. This is my third Ballast Point brew and I have to say they've done a great job and are def becoming one of my favs."

"Overall - pretty interesting and thought-provoking brew."
""
""
"O - A very drinkable wheat, more than perfect for a hot summer night. Like the bottle says, light and refreshing"
""
""
"Overall - I expected more from this fantastic brewer. It's very drinkable and would be great during the warmer weather but the flavours are fairly boring and it doesn't have many features that would leave me seeking it out again."
""
""

""

"I would definitely drink this if it was summer and I wanted a good session beer. Overall it's not something that I'm going to be craving, but it's pretty decent."

"Belgian style wheat, has the tart acidity on the tongue, but not a whole lot else. Not a lot of yeast or spice flavour. Okay, but not really Belgian. Would make a good session beer and pretty good for a light (4%) beer but not a great representation."

"This is a little disappointing. Overall, it's a little winey and has little in the way of substance. It's one dimensional and is lacking some of the nuances one would expect in a Belgian beer."
"O- A refreshing easy to drink Witbier. Nothing mindblowing, but I'd certainly drink another. Not overpowering, but adequate. Good mix of flavors to keep it intersting throughout-"
"This is a pretty safe wheat beer, nothing out of the ordinary, though in saying this, nothing is offensive either."
"Cloudy leon yellow with a white cap that fell quickly to a collar. A bit of spott lacing. Bready malt aroma, lemon citrus, not much else but it's clean. Low to medium bitterness with more lemon and bread, a little on the sweet side. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly dry, decent texture. A pretty basic wheat ale, solid as far as execution but nothing inspired."
"Overall: I can't recall the last time I tried this, but it's a light, refreshing, and enjoyable Wit. The 4% ABV is a plus."
"O - This was a pretty good beer nothing crazy going on here just a well made enjoyable wheat ale worth trying if you see it"
"M/D: Lighter side of medium bodied but standin tow to tow with any medium bodied ale out there. Crisp clean finish makes this one really stand out for a Witbier. Honestly one of my most cherished session beers, and having this brewery just a 10 minute drive from my pad and fillin growlers for 8 bucks makes it a regular in my rotation and definitely one of my faves."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer, very crisp with a lot of flavor for a 4.0% ABV beverage. Well worth a shot."
"hints of banana, cloves, and an almost bubble gum like aroma peeking in through the mammoth wheat smell. Same held true for the flavor, with massive amounts of wheat present right away that melded themselves into a nice banana and clove profile that seemed to continue to develop as it continued to warm. Nice balance here with a light to medium body and smooth carbonation, left with a slightly dry flavor in the mouth, I went in for a few more sips leaving a nice bubble gum flavor throughout."
"In sticky-hot weather or an afternoon at the ballpark, this is exactly the kind of beer that would make you say ""Wahoo!"". It's not only in those conditions that it could be enjoyed, but those are probably the two situations in which I, personally, would turn to it. And even then I might reach for a better example if available. If not, I'd still be perfectly happy with this."
"I must say, this one is a tops for me in the witbier style. Well done. Definitely recommended."
"After seeing this bottle and label makes you wonder where Gage Roads got their inspiration and it pours a very hazy pale yellow straw hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is spicy wheat and citrus,it has a light bodied silky mouthfeel and has tastes of candied wheat,corriander,citrus and finished with a spicy hop dryness and overall this would be a great Summer Session drop and very easy to drink."
"O: I was all set to not like this beer, but the taste came through and bumped it up nicely. It's not the best I've had of this style, but I'd have it again."
"I sampled this one on tap at the Ballast Point Brewing Co./Home Brew Mart in Linda Vista. Poured a clear pale white-ish color, with a bubbly white head on top. Aromas of lemon, light dough and a hint of spice. On the palate, this one is light bodied and refreshing, with flavors of light bread, citrus zest and coriander."
"I'd say this is a better Hefeweizen than a lot of beer claiming the style. Definitely not the typical sharp and skinny Wit. I'll have to try this in the bottle; it's definitely great on tap."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery in a pint glass, the beer is an opaque, milky yellow color with chunky, wheat residue head. The head actually broke up into parts as it floated along the top of the beer. Spicy and sweet aroma, with highlights of lemony scents. The beer has a bready taste, with peppery and clove spiced characteristics. The beer maintains a light body desspite the appearance, smell, and flavors. It is a bit acidic, and the carbonation makes the finish sharp. Decent Wit."
"Verdict: Decently priced, and it needs to be so you can drink enough of it. Good for warm weather and getting your non-beer drinking friends drunk. Worth trying."
"O: This is a really nice Witbier. A bomber of this would be quite perfect while grilling out in the summer. Very clean, balanced and refreshing."
"D: Easy to drink if you enjoy this style. While not my top style, I appreciate the quality of this beer."
"Perhaps the weakest offering from Ballast Point, being a cross between an American unfiltered wheat ale and a witbier. It isn't bad, just boring and lacklustre."
"Very smooth and drinkable beer, for the price, could be a great session beer, nice for the summer (although I drank it in the winter and it was just fine)..."
"Big 22 ounce offering pours like a banana smoothie, deep clouded yellow golden body, thick and creamy white head with specks of yeast imbedded in it. Thick chunks of lacing cling to the glass. Aroma has mild hints of citrus/a touch of banana/clove/coridander. Nice west coast style wheat, a touch of herbal hops really don't impart much bitterness low hop rates for sure. Flavor was fantastic a nice creamy texture citric/grassy wheat sweetness with a touch of banana/clove/citrus great carbonation level going on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied efferescent airy carbonation really creates a unique drinking experience. Drinkability overall was quality a wheat chock full of flavor, glad I didn't pass on this little gem of a session ale from the West Coast."
"D- A low abv and good carbonation make this a nice choice for a warm summer night. Nothing about the flavor sticks out too much but pretty good nonetheless."
"In the end, though it doesn't get me excited, it is an enjoyable and worthwhile drink."
"D- This beer as low of a score I gave it I did kind of enjoy it a lot actually. The lower ABV makes this a good session beer. The light flavors on this beer made it easy to drink and I could see myself drinking a lot of this. This is why the drinkability is so high for this beer."
"Decent beer for the summer, wouldn't be my go to. Average."
"D - Dull, but drinkable. My least favorite offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"Hazy golden color with a thin ring of white. Bottle mentions unmalted wheat and oats - I thought the haze was from bottle conditioning/not filtering the the beer, but presumably the fine folks at Ballast Point have more experience than me. The nose is grainy with light citric notes and that faint ester kick that identifies the wit. In the mouth, we've got a lot if carbonation, lending a slight metallic edge to orange peel and lemon. Backed by a slight spiciness (some coriander was harmed in the brewing of this beer), the pale malt, oats, and wheat base provides a smooth if overly thin drinking experience. The low abv and generally thin character do little to piqué my interest, but Wahoo is a fine companion for not thinking too much and enjoying a crisp, refreshing beverage on a warm, sunny day (March or otherwise)."
"Pours a nice golden color typical of the style. A bit of haze and an appropriately-sized white head. Very nice smell with some of the typical wheat scents coming through in addition to a few hefe characteristics. Taste was nice with some of the German-type yeast coming through again. Simple, but quite enjoyable. Light-bodied with ample carbonation. Drinkability was very nice, as this was quite refreshing on a hot August day."
"Drinkability: Seeing as this one came in a 22oz. bottle, but goes down so easily. You could drink a few of these out on a warm day...hands down. Not really going to test your taste-buds, but the smoothness of it makes for a pleasurable drinking experience. Take a chance on it...seems like a dependable brew."
"A nice sessionable wheat beer here. Kind of a cross between a wit and a hefeweizen leaning closer to being a full fledged hefe' than a belgian style witbier."
"Found on Topsail Island, North Carolina. Pours a golden orange with a thin lacey white head. Has an aroma of orange peel and coriander. Tastes more like a classic wheat, flavors of banana and bubble gum. Very slight bitter edge at the very end. Very refreshing on a hot October day!"
"Could've been better, could've been worse."
"Drinkability: I was all set to expect an assertive West Coast angle on the style but what I got was a Wit that tips its hat to an American Wheat"
"Bready on the tongue with some spice revealing itself mid palate and a subtle yet pronounced orange citrus close that lingers briefly. Offers a good feel and a carbonation that is good for the body of the beer, which is somewhat fuller than typical for the style. Decent drink, limited only by the general lack of pizazz in the flavor department, which does expand and improve with some warming however."
"Skip this one..."
"D-I enjoyed this beer alot, it does really grow on you. It's great out the door, and gets better as you go. I guess that applies for a lot beers though huh? It was very good, I am recomending this beer to my friends who all drink coors light or blue moon seasonals. I love the idea of supporting a local Southern California brewery as well.I picked this up at a Bev Mo' pretty far from that brewery. Good for Ballast Point, keep up the good work."
"i usually prefer the more creamier wheat beers, but this was still nice to try....i'd pass it over if there were other choices available"
"D - Very easy drinking summer beer - I could session this beer like mad. Very refreshing on a hot day due to its light palette impact, and very moderate abv."
"I had two seperate pours from this. The first looked something like watered down orange juice with some small debris seen floating, the second was cleaner and had a dark yellow appearence with some faint head on the top. WW has scents of wheat, belgian yeast and some subtle hops. Taste is the same but I also get some squeezed lemon, spices(clove), and just a bit of hop taste. The feel was good for a wit but not as crisp as others, this was rather smooth. Drinkability is great with a low abv but this style is not my bag."
"Overall, the combination of different elements make this worth a try (my girlfriend liked it), especially for a summer session beer. Compared to a lot of American takes on Hefeweizen, I would rate it a little higher, but Wahoo is simply out-classed when compared to many other witbiers."
"Drinkability: Session beer for the summertime heat. A perfect beer for Cinco De Mayo to be shared with mexican style food. I strongly recommend."
"Wahoo is easily the most disappointing beer I've had from Ballast Point. It's not impressive in any respect. I'd suggest that they remove this one from the lineup. If even they didn't replace it, their arsenal would be improved overall. I really like Ballast Point and wanted to like this one quite a bit. But, it's extremely disappointing. Can't recommend it."
"I liked this one, but didn't love it. It's an easy drinking summer session beer for sure. I wish the aroma was duplicated a bit better in the flavour, although said flavour was still pretty good nonetheless."
"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is low. Drinkability is pretty good. Very refreshing. Overall, nothing special, but a pretty good wheat beer. Not an especially good example of a wit (I think it's more of a hefe), but a solid brew."
"It's not very impressive. It borders on BMC only with a bit more drinkablility"
"D: This is a decent American example of a witbier. Not what I'd call brilliant, but okay."
"Pours a light cloudy orange with middling lacing. Minimal spices in the nose like coriander and clove. This is a light wit w/ not too much going on but passes clean and smooth with some pleasant spices and a milt tart citric flavor. Very quaffable and easy-going; nice to have a on hot day to start off a few rounds of beer drinking."
"The drink is fluffy and medium in body with lively carbonation and soda-pop drinkability. No, the taste isn't anything to write home over, but with the brew clocking in at only 4% ABV, this is a beer I could drink all day."
"M - Just under medium bodied, lots of carbonation."
"D - This could be an easy stand-by beer to go to when nothing else strikes your fancy. I wouldn't stick with drinking it all night, but it's good to give your palate a break once in a while with something that easily tastes good."
"Not much coriander or orange in this wit..."
"Poured the bottle of Wahoo Wheat into my Stone Ruination Pint Glass. This unfiltered brew had a load of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The bottle identifies this as a Hefeweizen, but it is more of a Blegian White. Anyway the beer poured with a 2 finger head which quickly dissipated. It was a nice golden cloudy yellow. The ABV is low enough that you could enjoy a few of these without going overboard (no pun intended). The wheat was a little strong but still enjoyable. Nothing else stands out about this wit beer."
"D - Decent wheat beer, perhaps a little past its prime. Still, it was pretty tasty overall, but I won't be in a big hurry to get more."
"At 4% I suppose you could drink this all day, but why? Adequate."
"Drinkability: I was all set to expect an assertive West Coast angle on the style but what I got was a Wit that tips its hat to an American Wheat; ho-hum"
"Appearance wasn't great: a clear, yellow-orange color, with a quick-fading fizzy, white head. Little of the hazy look at a great witbier. The smell was good and true to form: clear, crisp, and clean, plenty of wheat and yeast, nice and spicey, and cirtusy-sweet too. The taste was fairly average: it had all of the ingredients of a good witbier: plenty of wheat, malty and bready flavors, yeast, spices and clove (but not as much as the smell would indicate), and sweet, citrus flavors (more than the smell lead on). It was enjoyable enough, but it was just too sweet, and a bit watery. The flavor wasn't as complex or as full as I would have liked. The medium-fizzy carbonation and the thin mouthfeel only increased the feel that I could drink this beer like water. All in all, it was drinkable, but average, feeling more like a session beer than something finely crafted."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, not a bad beer but there are several others in the style that I'd pick first."
"Not all that happy with this one. Pours cloudy gold with very little head. Good spice and citrus in the aroma, but it is mixed with a dank basement odor that is supposed to be wheat. The taste is very yeasty, to the point of souring the beer. This could be pretty good if they would just tone that down."
"Notes from 5/17/06"
"T:"
"D: Drinkability is good overall. Found it to be crisp, refreshing, tart and easy enough going down. While it wont knock your socks off per style, it does prove to be a nice summer time picnic session beer that you can pass the time with."
"Pours a very cloudy light yellow/orange with a small white head that doesn't leave much lacing. The smell is somewhat strong with with the scents of clove,banana,and wheat. The taste is very crisp with wheat flavors; clove,banana,and some pepper. The m/f is light and the flavors mix well. Abit thin,but it's still a nice crisp summer beer."
"D- Really god drinking wheat and this is coming from somebody who normally doesn't drink much wheat ales."
"Beer pours a pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Nose has hints of lemony wheat. Taste is lemony wheat with a slight hint of pepper. Mouthfeel is light bodied, goes across the palate decently. Drinkability is good, this would be a very good tailgate beer the first part of the football season here in the desert."
"pours a very pale golden with constantly streaming bubbles that create a tightly beaded snow white head that quickly fades to a thin cap. The bubbles keep on coming, though. Pretty light in the nose, with some clean, slightly lemony, grassy smells, but little spice and quite faint. The taste is a little more developed and somewhat more assertive, but still a little soft. Still, pleasant tastes of lemon, light cream, an herbalness, a trace of minerality, and some light floral bitterness. The mouthfeel is soft and creamier rather than sharper. Tasty, but a bit too soft. It needs a bit more citrus and/or spice to give it some more crispness and bite."
"Drinkability: Solid drinkability, as it's very refreshing and has enough flavor to keep me going back. I went through this bomber pretty quickly and would certainly buy a six-pack if I saw one. It's better than a lot of domestics but not quite as good as a lot of real Belgians, but it's hard to find a good domestic Wit these days, one going back to, at least in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability; mouthfeel is on the thin side, and is only compounded by the lack of carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good."
"Drinks pretty easy, not quite on point for a WIT, but I'll just guess they were shooting for an American signature on the style. Much better wits out there to be sure"
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a cloudy yellow with a white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. Nose of spices, with corriander and citrus in the front, on top of wheat Smooth and crisp mouthfeel, and nice flavors of citrus and spices. Dry finish. Very easy to drink."
"D- This beer really did not do it for me. Lacked individuality and drinkability due to the watery texture. Not exactly recommended, better witbiers out there."
"A nice easy drinking Wit, good summertime beer."
"This brew had potential that soon vanishes. Seriously, after pouring the last part I walked away and temporarily forgot about it, as the orange (and lemony?) what should have been tart became sweet. This is not quite the refresher that this style should be."
"This beer is kind if boring and I probably won't buy it again. I'll waste my money on other wit beers. Reminds me of a BMC with slightly more flavor. Not impressed."
"D: An above average witbier made here buy Ballast Point, and widely available, would buy again, but there are better American wits made."
"Overall a decent, but not outstanding offering. Flavor is pleasant and unified. Worth a try."
"This beer had a nicely carbonated cloudy pour. It pours a nice light head that retained through the course of the beer. Minimal lacing involved. It is a very drinkable standard unfiltered wheat. I would like to see a draft pour. Nice wheat and light citrus taste."
"D - This is a pretty tasty beer."
"Overall- This 1 just didn't have enough of a punch. The flavors and feel were too weak. Otherwise easy to drink and could be quite refreshing on a hot day."
"We still have one beer left in the Second Unorganizied Invite, which will end tonight, and then we'll reveal the winner of this invite."
"D: A nice beer for warm weather but I would say that it would be a top choice for a wheat beer all year long. A tad expensive at $5 a bomber but worth it."
"Tasted of wheat, some light breadiness with low level citrus accents in the back. Fairly easygoing and thirst quenching. Body was a little bit thin, but passable. This would work outdoors in the summer, it's a fairly utilitarian Witbier."
"Pours quite cloudy, with a dull, biege color tinged with green. Tiny head that leaves a faint collar. The nose is quite spicy with coriander and some other spices I can't name, although the overall effect is dry and cinnamon-like. Relatively little citrus character exists in the nose. On the palate, brisk bitterness and carbonation first off, followed up by a creamy coriander note and then a light, fresh fruit note. The finish is spicy and a tad yeasty. Overall, this is a decent witbier, albeit lacking in citrus and fruitiness. Still, it's a drinkable and mildly thirst quenching beer."
"I poured Wahoo Wheat slowly, cautious of the active and massive heads often lurking in wheat beers. However head was lacking so I poured with more vigor and quickly created a moderate sized brillant white head. Wow! I've never seen a wheat beer with this color before! Pale, straw, golden for sure but Wahoo shows me a bit of lemon too! I sniff and find cloves and a hint of orange. I drink and immediately notice a thinness to the brew but at least it is very smooth. Maybe from the oats used in the grist? Thinness aside, Wahoo is very drinkable and refreshing, a bit of tartness in the finish. My lady friend liked it too, which of course skews my perception of this unfiltered Belgian style Wheat brew."
"D: Despite all of the above it is super drinkable and a good choice for a lawnmower beer. I think she paid $3 for the 22 which also makes it a regular choice if it is available."
"After its release from the 22 ounce bottle, its has a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a king sized white creamy head that ever so slowly dissolves letting the lace from a fine sheet to encircle the glass. Nose has a citrus like crispness, sweet grain aroma, also a hint of fruit, pleasing to the nose and the eyes. Start has a perfect grain presents, somewhat sweet, a minimal bite at the back, top is medium in its feel. Finish has a crisp acidity, the hops subdued and pleasant, dry aftertaste, a great beer for those bygone days of summer, heck its a good beer anytime."
"Over all this is a decent wheat beer. Not my favorite."
"Not my favorite Ballast Point offering."
"Ahhh a little better in the flavor. Rich with orange pill and candy sugar with corriander and pale wheat. Straighforward approach, very light therefore very drinkable. Not a bad wit yet much is lacking that could help benefit this brew."
"Poured into a glass and noticed the beer had a pale yellow color very little head to speak of and had a slight citrus scent. The taste is very good it went down very smooth. This is my second Ballast Point beer and I am becoming a fan of the label. I would recommend this to anyone who agrees with my reviews."
"D - Goes down easily, but the taste doesn't inspire the tastebuds to had a second one."
"Dusty, almost powdery feel. Light and refreshing. Nice spice and citrus flavor that rolls well with the yeasty malt tones. Not as flavorful as, say Hoegaarden, but still hits the mark style-wise. Worth a try, especially if you enjoy the Ballast Point line."
"Drinkability is ok. But I don't really care for this one. Don't think I'd buy it again. The last two Ballast Point beers I have had were quite good, this one however was not."
"Cloudy lemon gold. Short, fizzy, cracking head of dirty white bubbles that quickly vanishes leaving a floe of fine foam. Big bubbled, chunky carbonation streams pop at the surface. Wheaty aromas, filled with coriander, and a hint of sharp orange peel, are on the light side, but still nice. Orange peel and coriander play along a medium light body peppered with sparky carbonation. The wheat adds a gentle fruitiness while the orange peel adds some zip to the finish. There is a tingly mouthfeel from the carbonation and at times the body feels a tad thin. The finish is spiked with a dash of cloves and lingering orange rind zest. Overall, this is a nice wheat beer, adequately, but not overly, spiced and nicely carbonated."
"Pours a hazy light-yellow, like pineapple juice with a very small head that had no retention. The faint aroma of citrus gently touched the nose, I couldn't pick out much afterwards. The taste was a nice surprise. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but very refreshing. The spices were nicely balanced with the light hopiness that tingled across the tongue. Very drinkable, would be a perfect beer on a warm summer evening. Will have to search this one out next summer."
"drinkablilty: a good drinker. an interesting beer which i liked."
"Last swigs: Entry level hefe that would do any salad proud. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here."
"D: Light and refreshing. Lightly cloying but not overpowering...I think its probably from the heat (outside temperature) though."
"I don't usually think of Ballast Point when I think of outstanding craft breweries (perhaps because California is chock full of them), but I've been more than pleased with the small handful of their beers that I've been fortunate enough to acquire. Wahoo Wheat is not one of their better efforts."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with virtually no head. Smells of wheat bread and spicy lemon. The aroma is a bit yeasty as well. The taste is of spicy wheat and a very strong lemon flavor with some orange mixing in. Very light bodied, crisp and refreshing. Good choice for a hot summer day."
"There is nothing that really jumps out in the flavor of this beer, but all of the components just seem to work. This is a light refreshing beer that is a perfect tipple for the hot, 100+ degree Fahrenheit day that we are having here in Tucson. The beer was served at 48*F, and could even be a bit colder to boost the refreshing quality of this brew. I was expecting another ho-hum wheat beer here, and this beer is not that. It is perhaps not the most flavorful Witbier, and in fact seems to have some leanings towards the American Wheat side of the spectrum, but this beer is a great beer to be drinking on this warm Summer afternoon."
"Not a half bad wheat beer here it is certainly the equal of Blue Moon and far better than 90% of the uninspired wheat beers produced in the USA. Very drinkable and well worth a try for anyone who like the beer style."
"Notes: It was really about average in my book. Nothing fascinating to talk about ....it was rather mundane. A topic thats been on the boards alot is how can a brewery not put freshness dates on their beers. While it doesn't bother me that much on most beers a freakin 4% Wit needs one for sure."
"Overall: Funny how I thought Woo-Hoo when I saw this new Wahoo brew from Ballast Point in BevMo. Ballast Point is a personal favorite amongst the West Coast breweries that seem to lay low on the radar stakes. This is nice enough but it lacks a little specialness for me to pick this one up again."
"A pleasant, easy drinker. Kind of mellow for the style, which is interesting since it's a mellow style to start with."
"This was one awesome beer. I had it on tap at Dave&Busters and if it weren't $5.35 a glass I would have drank much more. It poured a medium yellow color with a nice white head that stuck around till the end and left very nice lace. The beer was very hazy, of corse, and you could not see through it at all. The smell was very crisp and citrusy. The taste was awesome, one of the most refreshing beers I've had in awhile. There was a great orange-ish tang to it along with a slight hop bite at the end. I have a feeling that this would be a good transition beer for people trying to get into the world of craft brews."
"Poured nice and pale, with a dense dense creamy tasting foamy head. Strong generic fruity nose, with a little spice. Maybe some banana. Hop bitterness is low. Not overly yeasty. Flavor is not very intense, but there are no off flavors, and it makes a nice light beer to go with really light food. My risotto and shrimp dish was a little much for it even."
"This impressive and refreshing Belgian white ale is quite a good catch.  The presenting color is cloudy and almost white with a nice head.  The aroma and flavor is a nice tangy ester with a subtle hop presence.  A very nice representation."
