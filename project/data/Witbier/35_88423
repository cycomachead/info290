3.57,5,,,,,,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a weizen glass. Hazy as per the style, a dull yellow-orange with around one finger of lacy white head clinging to the sides of the glass. Aroma bright and citrusy, orange, tangerine, lemon, and lime rinds with a little pineapple, woody seed spice, candied ginger, and faint grassy hops. These same elements echo on the palate. Minimal malt/wheat flavor here, with this eschewed in favor of citrus soda, ginger, very light coriander (Sam Adams does a good job of not overdoing this with their wits), and an odd metallic sweetness. Fizzy, with a curiously empty body and a saccharine metallic finish. Sam Adams brews a number of witbier variations and this is not one of the stronger takes. Great aroma and an OK showcase for the citrus and spice flavors but lacking in body and malt backbone.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 06, 2014"

Smell is very rich of spices citrus slight coriander. the order is someone intoxicating but I believe it is a false pretense to the actual flavor of the beer. Flavor is of sweetness and bitterness at roughly the same time definite taste of coriander right at the beginning it fades away into a gravelly carbonated finish. not feel as I said it was very carbonated and it goes down slightly gravelly. All in all it is an average beer. Not Sam Adams' best.","James_NelsonIV","Aug 06, 2014"

Now for the taste, it is smooth with some citrus. The mouthfeel is nice, clean,and refreshing. This brew has a nice balance to it, I would get this brew again.

Smooth and easy drinking. Good session beer especially for spring and summer. Similar to the original "white ale" by samuel adams. Better than I expected.

Very similar to Blue Moon, but possibly a bit more tart and not quite as sweet. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with a mouthcoating carbonation.

Pours hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, tangerine, orange peel, pear, coriander, pepper, wheat, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance of malt, spice, and yeast notes; but it is very weak. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, coriander, pepper, wheat, bread, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, coriander, pepper, wheat, bread, light clove, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice and pleasant flavors with good balance of malt, spice, and yeast esters; with a fair amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very solid witbier. A little weak on flavors; but is well balanced and very easy to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

Mouthfeel is medium on the palate carbonation a bit sluggish for how heavy the spices linger between sips, I could use something more palate cleansing.

The spicing was soft, and almost homogenized to the point it was hard to distinish individual quality. The sourness factor was turned down a bit.

I was hoping for a bit more of a Belgian yeast vibe in the flavor, but it really isn't there, as this is closer to a german hefe than a Belgian wit in a number of ways. the orange element is also pretty weak, and its too herbal from the coriander. it is refreshing, but its also a little soapy. fine carbonation and a less than medium body makes it pretty drinkable, but I just don't feel like drinking more than the two per 12er that comes in this box. its really underwhelming, especially after sam has made some pretty fun wits over the years. this is one to pawn off on your guests.","StonedTrippin","Mar 18, 2013"

In this case, it resulted in a dense, fluffy finger of bone-white head with great retention that allowed me to ensure that I had emptied the bottle. Clarity was indeed hazy, not cloudy, so I give them props for truth in advertising and the color was an orangish-yellow. Nose really gave off orange (peel) and tangerine and I was anxious to compare this to the previous beer that I reviewed of the same style. Mouthfeel was big and full, not overly carbonated, but more creamy. In fact, the taste reminded me of a Dreamsicle/ Creamsicle, which was the frozen novelty that consisted of a vanilla ice cream center enrobed by orange sherbert. I used to love them as a kid in the summertime. Ah, nostalgia while drinking beer. There is nothing better. I finally got the spiciness on the finish, but they really dialed it in to the point that it did not interfere with the orange. I have had wits that tasted and felt as though I had sprinkled black pepper on my tongue and it is not a pleasant experience. Neither is its polar opposite, in which the brewer cannot pull the trigger and it ends a bland, watery mess. This was good.","woodychandler","Mar 16, 2013"

There's a mild tart feel with floral tangerine flavor with more smooth, doughy bread. Make sure you let this one warm up for at least 20 minutes, it's much better at cellar temps.

Aromas of apricot and orange rind, with a bready and slightly buttery undertone. Very sugary sweet smell overall. Flavors of bread, first and foremost, with a blended marmalade highlight of sweet citrus and apricot. Unbalanced, and a touch cloying. The body is thin and filmy from the carbonation, and there is a sharp, frothy finish. Syrupy sweet aftertaste. This beer is a little much on the sweet for me, but I could see it being appealing to the cider population venturing into the beer world.","GarthDanielson","Feb 22, 2013"

The nose comprises light wheat, a pinch of black pepper, and a vague sense of citrus peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with less pepper and a tad more citrus. Everything still comes across as watered-down, artificially muted. It doesn't wanna be gagged, but what victim does, right? The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty meek wit, one with precious little spicing and a character so bland Michael Bay wants to replace him with something more rounded for one of his background characters.","TMoney2591","Feb 20, 2013"

It does not taste like a standard wit, it's a little too heavy on the citrus. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and a tad bit thin. Kinda like seltzer was added. It's actually a pleasant drink.

This didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, but the flavors lost my interest quickly and combined with the sweeetness they would become too much for me to drink multiples. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style the aroma and taste were, they were just what I expect from the style and a little more intense then most. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was too thick with not enough carbonation, if those were fixed I think it would help the drinkability a little. I wouldn't buy this beer again on it's own, it's a good for what it isn't but it isn't something that I have the urge to buy again, but i do recommend giving it a try if your a Witbier fan and this might make a good choice for you Blue Moon drinking friends. All in all I thought this was a solid Witbier, it had some good aspects and some bad aspects, but it sill came together alright and I would rather have this than a Blue Moon. Another solid beer from Samuel Adams, the kings of solid beers.","StoutHunter","Jan 20, 2013"

3.98,17.1,4,3.5,4.25,4,4,"A new Sam Adams brew....this one is yellow-gold and hazy. The head is bright white, but not long-lived. It's aroma is of wheat twang, citrus, and spice. It is a little muted, especially compared to the flavorful taste. Soft, sweet, and wheat. It has a subtle spice, and a fullness that is enjoyable. Very nice beer.","Suds","Jan 18, 2013"

4.15,22.1,4,4.5,4,4.25,4,"It pours a beautiful hazy gold with a white head. The head has nice retention. lacing doesn't really kick in until there is just a thin layer of foam atop the beer. The aroma is full of intense orange and the tangerine is noticeable. Corriander and malt are definitely present as well. The taste pretty follows the aroma. lots of orange and hints of malt. The corriander kind of gets lost among teh muck here, as it is slightly citrusy. It has a moderate mouthfeel, although it is refreshing. The carbonation is light and relatively gentle. I love it. It's not too simple and it's not so complex that you get lost in a jungle of aroma and flavor. This beer knows what it is. Highly recommended.","silverking","Jan 14, 2013"

I guess what my problems with this (and other recent SA selections) is that its obviously brewed for the masses, forced into stores waaaay too early (its still jan.in New England and spring beers are better in spring), and ever since SA got rid of the White Ale, every seasonal 12er has some lame attempt at originality. Stick with what git u there Jim.","drewschi54","Jan 10, 2013"

3.68,8.2,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's Spring mix pack. Pours a hazy light yellow body with nearly an inch of white head. Coriander dominates the aroma, with citrus and pith and citrus. Lemon, orange, pith, and a fair bit of spice toward the finish of the flavor. Light in body and carbonation. Not bad. A decent example of the style.","MrHurmateeowish","Dec 29, 2012"
3.63,6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"OVERALL: Not a bad beer here, the flavors are fresh and not artificial tasting. I normally don't like to draw comparisons to other beers in reviews but the flavor here is very similar to Magic Hat #9. A crafty fruit beer with a wheat base. This is a gateway beer to lead the masses to craft. Even as a seasoned beer drinker, I have to say this isn't too shabby.","Stinkypuss","Dec 29, 2012"
