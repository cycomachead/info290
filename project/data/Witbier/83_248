The true nectar of the gods.  The best part about it is that it doesn't taste like wheat at all.  Hoegaarden tastes like sweet citrus, with refreshing carbonation and a very smooth finish.

Bottle 33 cl - Batch 02222:1319 AROMA: orange and citrusy aromas mixed with coriander. mdoerate sweet wheat background. hop aromas not discernible. APPEARANCE: pale straw color and hazy. average moussy white head with below average retention. TASTE: mild sweetness with a wheat component that persists. the coriander and citrus flavours are less stronger than the aromas. low bitterness with a semi-sweet finish. PALATE: medium-low body with average carbonation. OVERALL: the traditional wit with more subtle flavours than the aromas.","titvs","Dec 10, 2014"

The head is fluffy white, the colour is exactly what you would like to see in a wheat beer - cloudy and golden with streams of bubbles - and the smell and taste is smooth, inviting and rewarding. I imagine I could sit and drink this one after another until I fell over and enjoy every minute of it. It's a really delicious and enjoyable beer that's accessible for almost everyone. It's both an easy entry beer and a beer you'll want to return to.","Markiboy","Aug 20, 2014"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 8/11/2014. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%, Overall this is a damn nice witbier. All around well balanced and robust flavors of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

It pours light and cloudy with a soft gold color and has a very thick foamy head. Tastes very smooth and thin, yet it has a rich citrus and vanilla finish which rounds the beer off wonderfully.

4.12,9,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"DATE REVIEWED: May 22, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hoegaarden tumbler... OCCASION: freshman baseball--officially over, and marking the day with the official wit... APPEARANCE: pours a pale, golden yellow, unfiltered and misty with bubbles; white uneven head rings the glass; attractive... AROMA: profound yeast and lemon zest; a suggestion of citrus, but not enough to overpower... PALATE: bubbly, refreshing almost medium-bodied; a bit fizzy too; unlike most wits, it supplies a lingering aftertaste... TASTE: tart--banana! lemon is secondary, and some citric, slightly acidic elements in the aftertaste--this is what warm nights were made for...OVERALLL: I recall being really turned on to this beer in 2003, when traveling through Europe in record-breaking heat drove Shan and I toward sidewalk cafes and alcohol that refreshed; cutting through the sentiment, Hoegaarden does indeed refresh with enough character to be sought after among the myriad of summer ales....","dacrza1","Jun 03, 2014"

The smell is full of citrus and Belgian wheat. The taste is light with a bunch of citrus flavors like lemon, orange peel, and a hint of banana that add to the wheat flavor and give it a nice crisp finish. The mouthfeel is the only problem for me as it was a little too light for the winter but I can see this being a staple of the summer. Very much enjoyed and would definitely recommend to any blue moon fans looking to step it up.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 05, 2014"

Some sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of wheat, grains, lemon with orange peel and spice. The taste is about the same with the mix of orange and lemon zest coming through first with some spice for the finish. Semi-sweet also. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation.

Bottle is appealing, has a tart and spicy taste, is quite refreshing, and very easy to drink. I could drink it every day. It stands alone or is good with food, and has the benefit of being easy to find in grocery stores. Even Trader Joes has it, and it is cheap. Well worth it.","biokid23","Jan 27, 2014"

My favorite wit that I've had so far. Would make an excellent summer beer. I would rank Hoegaarden below most hefeweizens but above most American pale wheats.

3.5,-7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had on tap for the purpose of this review. This was a grad school staple however and I am quite familiar with this classic witbier in the bottle as well. A hazy banana yellow beer with a decent amount of white head and ample carbonation, Hoegaarden smells of fruity yeast esters first and foremost, along with some dry bread and phenolic spice notes like allspice or dilute clove. I remember this beer being hugely fruity and fairly sour as well, less spicy, and my memory was indeed pretty accurate. A little dry popcorn malt and lots of bubble gum/tutti fruity esters along with some banana, the spicy phenols take a back seat but there is a sour backdrop that evokes a little raw pineapple or maybe unripe apples or pears that prevents the sweetness from being cloying. The coriander spice shows up in the finish along with a pleasant lemony sourness but is fairly downplayed, to the betterment of the beer itself (drink this and then try a Rickards White or another mainstream US or Canadian wit and you'll see what I mean ... The Europeans use this spice more strategically and do not carpet bomb the taste buds). Mouthfeel is a bit chewy and there is some residual sweetness but the body is still fairly thin and watery, I guess its a witbier after all. If there is a standout flaw, said flaw is too much carbonation that masks the fruit and spice flavors more than is necessary. Still, any wit fan should know this icon.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 20, 2013"

It's a refreshing beer with good flavor, but it's also not that interesting either. Without a doubt the best witiber that's widely available (I can find it at any grocery store and many gas stations) but it's not complex enough to be intriguing.","DeFaz","Oct 03, 2013"

Pours a cloudy yellow with nice foamy white head. Lots of noticeable carbonation and unfiltered sediment! Sweet aroma of orange and coriander. The taste meets the nose with the orange and coriander. Very smooth and light. A touch sweet, but good. Refreshing! Great Summer beer no matter how you slice it. I'd have again on a hot Summer day!","DenverHopHead","Jun 20, 2013"

4.05,7.1,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"HW is better balanced, with no alcohol feel in the mouth. Although lacking balanced flavor, LT does not taste overly alcoholic, but there is more alcohol feel in it. Both are light and, under the right circumstances, refreshing. With right foods (e.g., Thai and Indonesian curries and Indian food that is not overly saucy) LT can be a very serviceable beer, but the strong coriander flavor and odor make it unsuitable for most occasions, including everyday drinking. HW is a perfectly reasonable everyday pour, especially in the summer. Original or not, it likely would not survive a comparison to some of the better American varieties, such as Allagash, but it can certainly hold its own. Long Trail, on the other hand, has a long learning curve ahead of it as a brewery. Even their best products (pale ale and IPA) seem to offer only a single taste note, where competitors offer a bouquet of flavors and aromas. Hoegaarden does pretty much only one thing but it does it rather well.","VictorWisc","Jun 14, 2013"

The smell is clean wheat maltiness with lemon and orange citrus combined with some peppery spice pretty much spot on for a Wit. When it comes to the taste the spices come out in the front with the citrus moving to the background, a background well framed in by the wheat. Also perceivable is some yeast character but overall everything is a bit overshadowed by the coriander spiciness. The mouthfeel is acceptable with high levels of carbonation combined with a light body however I would have preferred it to be a bit crisper with a cleaner finish. Overall this is a very commendable example of the style and as one of the most easily recognized and available witbeirs it is doing the style justice","fank2788","May 11, 2013"

Moderate snow white head and lacing, continuous bubble formation. Mild wheat aroma. Wheat and citrus, spicy pleasantly peppery carbonation. This carbonation is unusual and refreshing. Somewhat dry finish with lingering cardamon and bitter spices. Interesting and different.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2012"

The only difference is, when adding the lemon slice it has a bit more tart to it. A little bubblier mouth feel and a little harder to swallow. But overall a great beer. I accidentally poured from the bottle too fast so I had to wait for the beer to ""un-fizz"" in a sense to pour the rest in. But the head lasted nicely and the aroma was very lemon-y. Like I previously said, just a great beer.","Mikala","Jul 17, 2012"

The mouthfeel is smooth enough, leaving me with the sense that this was a quality Belgian witbier. I could drink a few of these before I started to get tired of the wheat flavor.

The taste followed suit with lots of lemon peel and spiciness; coriander and kind of white pepper. The mouthfeel was a little thin but finished quite crisp and refreshing.

While the liquid is the palest of yellows, its glow and ability to hold light inside amplifies its presence, reaches a gauzy opacity, haphazard large bubbles whiz upwards. The wheat is gentle in the nose, a drying supplement to the base of orange and lemon citrus, caraway, coriander, cinnamon and dried yeasts and baking dough, apricots and pears underneath, bare whiff of banana without impairing cleanliness, subtly steady length. Medium-bodied, semi-sluggish and apt to just plop down on the tongue, even allowing for a slight prickle from the carbonation. The anise, coriander, cumin spice supplemented by vanilla bean, these elements contribute to a sweetness throughout that lemon, orange citrus. Peach and apricot pulp, maybe melon or apple too. A few bubblegum notes. Wheat and grains appear about midway to dry out the palate. Keeps a steady message without too many moving parts, user friendly and not out to overtly challenge anyone.","farrago","Apr 12, 2012"

Now that you mention it I have not had a traditional European breakfast for an extended period that very much out stretches the length of my own sausage. Its almost salty, which is not a bad thing, but very much would go with my garlic seasoned sunny side up eggs. And perhaps a piece of the toast, with the real butter from next door and not the grocery. There is a medium carbonation, and the lace is still apparent. It would be much more pleasurable if it was the morning, as it should be waiting for me whenever I roll out of bed. From now on I will only trust a German...","mndlssphlsphr","Mar 28, 2012"

Regardless, Hoegaarden no longer impresses me the same way. Sure, it still stands as the hallmark of the style and I'm not sure I've ever seen such a beautiful, pale white glow in any other beer... but now when I drink it the beer seems to be too watery and thin and the unique flavors seem to be far too muted.

The aroma is unique for a Witbier, a shot of cracked pepper and citrus lemon.The beer is light in body, mouthfeel is smooth- flavor of soft wheat, spicy pepper, and lemon zest. After some research i found that the pepper flavor originates from the yeast strain they use and the sour lemon flavor is from the hop additions. Great beer, probably the closest that youll find to the ""original"" of the style. Never a bad choice to fall back on. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 06, 2012"

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy light yellow color with a fluffy white head. Malts and wheat tickle the nose with some hints of citrus.

The yeast adds to the beer without being to full to make it feel bready which I like.

Flavor is tart and refreshing, orange tartness upfront, coriander mid palate, but a bit of a watery finish. Not much length. Decent medium carbonation. I know that this is supposedly the first Belgian White ale, but something tells me over the years of being bought out by larger companies it has lost something along the way and become a more watered down version of it's original self.

It had a great fruity/banana flavor, as well as a prominent yeasty/wheat taste. There was also a light citrus flavor that gave the beer crispness .

Subtle like a sledgehammer between the eyes! For the uninitiated, the yeast gives it a pleasant mustiness, but the black pepper and orange zest are also prevalent on the nose. Mouthfeel seemed kind of thin and it had a nice interplay of the wheat and spices on the tongue, somewhat zesty and refreshing.

This makes me sad because Hoegaarden was one of the first beers I ever really liked. I feel that its quality has dropped off since I first had it in 2006. In particular, it now has that special distinction common to mass-produced beer: it when slightly warmed, it has a chalky, artificial taste that makes it drinkable only when very cold. Overall, I still very much appreciate the seasonings added to this beer, but something has gone wrong here with the wheat, yeast, hops, or fermentation, and I see myself heavily, heavily favoring beers like Allagash White over Hoegaarden going forward.","ILessThan3Brett","May 10, 2011"

3.43,-9.3,4,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,"Hoegaarden pours a hazy straw color. My first thought was that it looked like a very cloudy glass of lemonade. A solid three fingers of frothy white foam top the beer and come up to the rim of the glass, before slowly creeping back down towards the body of the beer. Lacing is a bit spotty. The nose is surprisingly coriander forward, but has a solid orange-citrus presence as well. Finally there's a touch of sweetness from the wheat to complete the picture. Everything that should be here is, but for my money the proportions and ratios are just a little bit off. If the nose is just a little bit out of whack, the flavor takes that imbalance a little bit further. It's not quite like what I'd imagine downing a bag of crushed coriander would be like, but it's approaching that territory. It takes me a few sips to make it past that and enjoy the small citrus flourish that's present as well. There's no real support from wheat or any other malt to rein things in either. The unquestioned bright spot here is the picturesque light body and active carbonation full of small, precise bubbles. I don't recall the draft pours of Hoegaarden I've had seeming so aggressively coriander dominant, but I don't think I'll be reaching for a bottle of this any time soon.","axeman9182","May 06, 2011"

3.65,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice one finger head, looks very frothy, maybe even creamy. The head is completely white and the body is a hazy, clearish-yellow color. It's a very very VERY weird body, it looks like carbonated lemonade, I mean its cloudy, but at the same time it's see through, it's like see through for only so long, and then the cloudiness kicks in. It has hues of orange, but when you hold it up to the light it looks way more yellow. The head is also interesting, it reminds me of what the top of a mocha or latte would look like, so that's good, because it looks creamy! Overall it looks super weird, but pretty good, and the head is still hanging around a little bit. This bee also has a very unique smell, I don't think I've ever smelled something as unique as this, it's just bursting with citrus. There is clearly citrus, oranges, probably lemons, and definitely coriander. All the citruses are there, and they are pretty recognizable, but they smell a lot different than say a blue moon or something else that uses the same ingredients, maybe they use more of them, or just better quality, not sure which, but it smells really good and really unique. It also smell really clean, super clean and probably really refreshing, overall a very nice aroma. Very tasty, I don't know if it deserves a 4 for taste, but either way it is super tasty and super unique. On some sips there isn't much flavor, but on others it's just bursting with flavor, you get all the flavors that were indicated on the smell, orange, lemon, coriander. Not much in the way of hops, a tiny bit of malts, but who really cares when this beer is so tasty! The only reason I don't want to give this a 4 is because it is a little light and watery at times. It's super tasty, but I just don't think it deserves a 4. Mouthfeel is decent, nothing too outstanding there. Drinkability is pretty good, I mean it's a belgian white, so it's not going to be hard to put away. Overall the two things that impressed me about this beer is how unique it is and how well the smell represented the taste.

I don't know if it's old or what, but I'm going to skew this review slightly because usually it's great. It has a really different color than most beers, kind of like a cream soda life saver, white with some yellow for those who haven't had that particular lifesaver. Anyway, it is hazy which is befitting of it's style. The smell is very original too, kind of fruity, but I couldn't tell you the fruit. Maybe grapefruit, or some kind of grapes. I think the taste is great! It's got alot of body from the wheat, with a tart finish on the tongue. Just the right amount of carbonation too.","flyingspatula","Apr 10, 2011"

It's not a great beer but definitely better than your average beer found at your average bar, and it's definitely refreshing. Availability also lifts this beer up in my mind since not a whole lot of beers like this are extremely popular.

If pouring this from a bottle use the instructions found on the side of the bottle stating how to pour the last 1/8 of the bottle into your glass after rolling it on its side. The mouthfeel is descent. Incredible drinkability. In Rome my friends and I used to have a bar in Campo De Fiori that we called the Hoegarrden Bar as it would serve incredibly sized drafts of this delicious nector for only five euros.

It tasted quite yeasty with a mild acidic flavor at first and finished about the same except for the hints of orange on the tongue left , to linger for a nice while.

Probably a good reference point for me, in venturing past my ""safe zone"" of dark craft beers. While there were no dominant flavours of citrus and or coriander, this subtle, refreshing, yet creamy beer is the smoothest and most drinkable of its type that I know of. Perfectly balanced. Not even a hint of sourness as many other white/pale/wheat ales go. The aroma was cologne-grade pretty, of subtle citrus, with no metallic or glassy smell.

It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall it goes down very smooth. This might have been due to the lackluster intensity of the flavors and aroma present. I have had this brew quite awhile back when I first started into craft beer and have just now gotten a chance to have it again for a review.

Wheat malt pervades the flavor profile, along with the estery yeast profile. More pear than apple, and more banana that either of those. The palate is almost bubblegummy, but refreshing nonetheless.

Drinkability is low. Overall this is a mediocre beer which I did not particularly enjoy. I feel it does not exemplify the style. There was no crispness as there is in other wits I have tried, just a syrupy candy sweetness. Maybe it has something to do with it being on tap.

I expected more out of it, to be honest. I can only rate it as average for its lack of outright flaws.

Out of the bottle the liquid was a milky, straw gold color with a bright white head. The foam both retained and laced well throughout. The aroma was classic, orange zest, coriander and tangy wheat. The flavors were similar, though the first taste was floral hops and malt sweetness followed by the curacao orange zest and lemon flavors as well as coriander and cloves. The flavors were well blended with nothing dominating the others. The mouthfeel was very smooth and I found it great for quaffing on a hot summers day.

Citrus, fruit juice, yeasty, coriander, esters of banana and pineapple, faint bitterness towards the end. Thick and crisp.

For one reason or another, I have not reviewed until today. Poured into pint glass at Tracks in Penn Station Manhattan whilst waiting for my LIRR train to celebrate my Mothers birthday. After taking out the lemon the barkeep placed on the pint. Partially hazy golden with a half finger head and decent lacing that faded to a half cap very quickly. Bottom half is almost clear. Nose is mild yeast and lemon and estery dash. Taste is moderate yeasty with lemon accents. Mouthfeel has spiced crispness at the start but weakens much to my chagrin.0r more succintly, it gets watery. Kinda chewy to start and carbonation remains with the legs. Unless my pallet has matured vastly or as many others have mentioned, th taste and body are not what I remember. Do recall reading they went back to old brewry and recipe but not sure. Not to say this is not a fine brew by any means and would recommend to all geeks and neophytes alike.","Brianmerrilyn","Jul 15, 2008"

This seemed so much better than the recent version I had from a bottle. That was OK but this was really a tastey treat to me, and I don't typically go for witbiers particularly.

Head retention was light with trim around the glass, updated regularly by large carbonation bubbles. Yeasty and floral aroma, can't smell the citrus very much. Spices are supported by the carbonation and overpower the wheat. The carbonation fades, and the flavor left behind in your mouth is the citrus and banana. I find this beer to be a bit watery and high on the carbonation. A little less carbonation and more body would make for a more drinkable beer.

The glass was filled with a very pale, hazy yellow and capped off with a foamy white head. The head could have stuck around longer for a wheat, but still nice, and left a ring and and small patches along the side. The aroma is citrusy, like lemongrass, and spicy/ bready. The taste follows similarly. Light, citrus sweetness hits the tongue first, followed by a very balanced and mild bitter bite. The finish is somewhat refreshing and the aftertaste is again a sweet, malty lemon flavor. The mouthfeel is light, but not watery and the carbonation is very fitting, not very heavy. Hoegaarden is very nicely balanced, light and refreshing enough to be easily drinkable. It's a good representation of the citrusy, wheaty characteristics of the Witbier style. Very nice, sessionable macro offering. A very good intro to wheat beers.","BiereBlanche","Nov 26, 2007"

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of white beers. From what I've heard - and not like this makes much of a difference - it has won the beer cup in its category many times - a consistent winner.

The head stared out as soapsuds and dissipated quickly but only to a ring around the collar that fell with the drink. Was supprised at the mildness, expecting a more robust and forceful taste, but was not under whelmed. The orange tone comes threw very well and mixes well with the taste of other botanicals. Smell was a bit lacking to me, though present. Would recommend this beer, would consider this as an introducer into beer for those who dont drink beer often or at all, especially those who dont like beer for the bitter beer taste that can be present which, in my opinion beer has a lack of.","boothy443","Oct 27, 2007"

I tried this beer at the Winking Lizard in Canton, Ohio because it was the beer of the month and you get to keep the huge glass (can always use more glassware). The beer came with a really nice white frothy head and the liquid was a nice cloudy yellowish gold. The head stuck around for quite a while and the lacing really sticks to the sides of the glass. The first mouthfull is really interesting, it hits you with a fresh zesty, citrus hit and goes down really smooth. I hope I am describing this right but my friend and I both thought that the after-taste was very much like clove. I really enjoyed this beer and it went well with the popcorn and loaded nachos ( I know, not the most sophisticated accompaniment), and it really hit the spot on a hot humid day. I would definately order this again.","maven2k","Aug 03, 2006"

Decent head, but the green tinge is a bit off-putting. The nose is centered around coriander, with a basis of citrus (lemon/orange, some kind of hybrid)... very warm smelling and appealing. The taste is dominated by carbonation up front, then the coriander and a late, lemony taste in the back of the throat, oddly enough. The taste structure and mouthfeel is very light -- like the wine spritzer of the beer world, but in a good way. This is one tasty, eminently quaffable beer, whose reputation is justifed IMO... although I'd love to taste the older version of this beer, if it's actually different like people say.","geexploitation","Feb 26, 2006"

It's always good, but the one hesitation I have with it is I've found it to be one of the more inconsistent beers. My previous experiences with it have varied widely from tap to bottle, and amongst all the bottles I've had (dozens) I've found it somewhat temperamental to all the usual beer variables (more so than most): heat, cold, sunlight, darkness, temperature served, glassware used, amount of sediment swirled into the glass, etc. It's never been bad, just often varying a few degrees one way or another.

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice light yellow color with white cloudiness to it and a fair white head. The smell and taste of this beer are quite similar, and pretty much the standard for the style. Lots of corriander, loads of yeast, and a bit of clean citrus. I got more citrus in the nose than on the tongue, and more yeast on the tongue than the nose.

Had to grab my quadmate and show him this interesting hue.Its creamy clear with a slight yellow tinge. The smell is pretty decent, coriander and citrus dominate, smell is on par with what I was expecting. Taste is pretty good, coriander really comes through strong with a crisp refreshing aftertaste. This is a fairly smooth brew, the flavors subside quickly in the aftertaste. As far as drinkability goes, I can see myself drinking a ton of this in the warmer months to come. This is one of those beerstyles similar to a biere de garde and a saison in where the taste doesnt initially wow me, but I find myself buying it on a weekly basis because I really do like it.","Iguana","Feb 14, 2006"

Hence I can only rate it as average for taste. I do like the way it looks though. This is the first time I've had a wit in a while, and I forgot just how pale these things are.

The aroma is a yeasty bread aroma with a lemon twang to it. The mouthfeel is very light with zesty carbonation. This taste is light and refreshing with a heavy wheat flavor than ends with a slightly bitter citrus bite. The aftertaste has a slight medicine and hops flavor. This of course is the flagship witbiere. I like it but there are some serious contenders out there. Hoegaarden is better on tap in my opinion. In the bottle a slice of orange in the beer kills that aftertaste where a lemon overruns too much of the flavor.","TheEclecticGent","Jan 30, 2006"

Tasted initially of a powerful banana with a slight cherry sweetness and a little bubble gum. Some fruit flavors then made themselves noticed with some coriander and dark sour cherries. There also was a sour citrus flavor that permeated all aspects of the beer. The mouth feel was light to medium bodied with a crisp tingly carbonation.

A massive snow-white head over three fingers reduces to a tight, long-lasting cap of foam; but produces minimal lacing. Strong belgian phenolic smell; like crayons and cloves. Extra pale malt and wheat aromas in the background. The taste is sweet, lots of wheat and pale malt, with a powdery yeast character. A subtle clove and coriander spiciness provides a delicate balance without need for much hop influence; which are almost totally absent. The body is light but gets some definte texture from the high levels of wheat proteins and suspended yeast. Mild aftertaste of phenols carries into the finish, but only compliments overall mellow malt flavor. This stuff just slips down the throat.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 08, 2006"

A nice cloudy yellow pours to a quick settling head. The smell is sweet and aromatic, kinda citrusy, not skunky in the least. Unparalleled in taste and drinkability, mouthfeel is very delicate, like a mildly carbonated soda, not aggravating in the least.

Smell is a very nice clean wheat malt with strong pepper and spice notes and a delicate lemon peel twang underlying everything. Taste is light, malty, and refreshing with a spicy coriander finish and some fruity banana and orange notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, highly carbonated, and finishes dry.

There was a tiny head on it that was very white. The aroma consisted of mostly lemons and a little bit of pepper. The taste was even more lemony. It reminded me a lot of lemonade with a lot of carbonation. Very smooth, silky feel to it. This beer is one of a kind and a definite thirst quencher. Perfect for summer.

The bready, yeast aroma accented with a bit of freshly cut grass. This beer has a very delicate mouthfeel and a light body. A wheaty, bready flavor dominates with a subtle, grassy, spiciness mixed with some notes of lemon. Hops are played way down and the finish is just shy of being too sweet and accented with coriander. This is a very easy drinking beer. The spiciness is less distinctive than I remember it being, but the last time I had this beer, I had it on tap -- perhaps the reason for the difference? The wheat flavor is huge in this beer. If you don't like wheat in your beer, your not going to like Hoegaarden.","marcobrau","May 07, 2005"

Flavor comes up a bit short ,i like a little more up front in a beer like this, it seems a little watery, almost as if i was using a frosted glass to drink it .

When you begin to swallow is when the texture really comes out. The lemons are definitely at the forefront of the taste, with carbonation taking it all down.

Insanely drinkable. My only problem is the mouthfeel, its a touch thin. That may be more a characteristic of the style rather than this beer though.

In the glass it is cloudy white with a little bit of yellow mixed in. The smell is of spices. If poured correctly (a technique which I have since mastered with my own Hexagonal glass and the Hoegaarden bottles I get at my liqour store) the head just hits the tips of the glass adding about half an inch to and inch at the top.

The carbonation is crisp and the body is very thin, bordering on too thin.

Hops are kept to a minimum, other than some Hersbrucker or other low alpha hop.

I love the scent of the banana and lemon intermingling, and the flavor of them together. This has such a clean and fresh flavor to it, so very refreshing and light. Mild and mellow finish.

The fruitiness came through and the bitterness - not from the hops - bit my tongue. I was expecting more a raucous flavor palate but was good.

Citric fruits with some sweetness were upfront accompanied by a peppery spice. The middle lost its sweetness and become tartier but was still fruity in taste. Coriander seemed to come into the mix there. There is also a wheat precense that seems to come with a clove flavor that reminds of a good hefe.

Hmm, what a smell. Big aroma of bread/yeast, floral citrus, various sweet peppers and spices, barley and wheat malts. Terrific taste. The sweet malts, spices and peppers are balanced well with the citrus and hop acidity. The mouthfeel is a little chunky. One of the negative effects of the yeast, perhaps.

It was nearly impossible to pick up on any subtlety or nuance in its light-straw color through the thick wheat haze. This beer had a hoppy, clean smell with just a hint of hops and citrus. Bubbly and crisp, its mouthfeel overpowered the almost candy-like textures of the beer. Oddly, though, the aftertaste is much maltier than expected, with a fading bitterness. All in all, a fairly decent beer, though probably not worth the hype.","JamesBerry","Jan 27, 2004"

I poured the bottle into a rather large, oversize Hoegaarden glass, he also brought. It poured a cloudy straw pale color with a carbonated white head. Lace was not a factor. The aroma was of citrus lemon. The taste was fruity with a lite drying hop finish. Clearly the zest of lemon and coriander stand out most.

The aromatics are focused and distinctly fresh orange zest and coriander in a very nicely balanced package. The mouthfeel is at once refreshing and cleansing-light to medium bodied. Flavors are very much orange, especially orange zest, and malted wheat. Spice notes trail on the finish and add dimension.

I see no reason to send it back or flip out about it. You can't expect every 20 something bartender to know the customs of serving a belgian beer. anyway) Ho pours the most unique looking pint of beer I've ever seen (sadly, the bar I frequent does not carry the right glass for it, so I take it in a pint glass). It has a lemon yellow body with a very hazy efferfescent look. Atop sits a tall fluffy head of white lace. Smells of citrus immeadiately predominate. The first taste is delicately sweet with a very refreshing mouthfeel. The aftertaste allows you to notice the spices used in flavoring the brew, most notably corriander and some clove. Orange, banana, and the taste of yeast all combine to make a very interesting taste, but one that is not strong at all.

The tastes were of wheat, citrus fruits (lemons), spice (pepper), and light hops. Finished and left a dry wheat feel in the mouth. Light bodied which is perfect for summer.

Pale cloudy yellow in color with a dense creamy white head. Strong lemony aroma, which is probably mostly due to the lemon they served it with. I would have turned down the lemon, but it seemed to compliment the beer well. Taste is citrusy and coriander. The perfect beer after cutting the grass on a hot summer day,","dmarch","Apr 08, 2003"

A huge creamy, thick, foamy head grew over and beyond and was quite a thrill to see. Smells right away of the orange and lemon, extremely citrusy. Nothing out of the ordinary for this Belgian beauty, but good non the less. Tastes of a citrus brew, very citrusy with orange and lemon strongly presented and felt, with a hint of spice, coriander I believe.

Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with small yeast particles dancing around in the heavy carbonation. A thick, fluffy white head presents itself upon pouring and slowly dies down leaving a beautiful lace on the glass. Aromas of lemon and coriander are very prominent. The flavors of yeast, citrus and spicy coriander engulf the taste buds all at once. Leaving you mouth begging for more. A clean and refreshing taste is left on the palate.

Taste is zesty, with a tart start, yielding to a somewhat spicy (corriander?) mid-palate, a finish of moderate floral hops, and a gently sweet aftertaste. Finish is slightly dry, body is medium-light, and the flavors are very well balanced and blend into each other oh-so-smoothly. Very refreshing and drinkable.","mzwolinski","Feb 25, 2003"

Nice head atop and I was careful not to let any lemon touch the inside (if I use lemon at all, it is in the summer, and only after I have tasted many offerings). Taste was super, as was its mouthfeel and drinkability. Nice subtly spicy, sweet flavor. Decided to sample this one even though the bar was a chilly temp.

A staple for any true belgium beer drinkers, it pours a classic pale hazy unfiltered yellow with a superb white head carrying all of the yeasty goodness this beer has to offer. The aroma is clove and banana laced, with other spices and coriander what a treat. More refreshing than a lemonade, in my opinion. A lighter bodied beer that has citrusy tone to it and then mellows out to form a great yeasty finish. Full of so many flavors with out over doing it, this is an amazing beer that I will never grow tired of. Yes it is drinkable on every level for quantity and enjoyment.","WVbeergeek","Feb 08, 2003"

The taste is a very refreshing, slightly sweet and sour mild lemon flavor.  Its very smooth in the mouth and goes down very easily.  The only real criticism I have is that it is almost too light-bodied.

The mouthfeel is marvelous, giving the drinker yet another quality to enjoy in addition to its taste.  Its taste is a raw collection of mellow tastes of lemons and pepper.

She made a statement about Genessee Cream Ale, but it's been ages since I had that beer. Genessee may compare in mouthfeel and overall zero likelihood of having any offensive components, but I don't think it could reach Hoegaarden's taste at all. As Marty Brennaman says when a baseball player swings at a pitch waaaay out of the strike zone, 'He couldn't havef hit that with an ironing board'. That's Genessee's chance of out-flavoring this ale.

A thick head of creamy texture is prevalent unless poured badly. A spicy and fruity blend of aromas makes up the texture of the smell. Orange and apples are the two scents that come to mind.

When sipped, the carbonation and sourness come first, then spiciness, and finally wheat. The hops come in with the coriander towards the end.

Huge orangey fruity aroma with some decent peppery spiciness in there as well.  Smooth yeast flavors as well as some fruitiness that floats in the background.

The aroma gives off a bit of citrus and spice, but not nearly as much as most other Belgians.  The drinkability is a high factor here.  Without the superior Belgian alcohol kick, one could have more of this bier and get away with it.  It took me more than one of these to get a good feel for it.

Soft all around on the palette w/ a very smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes clean and sweet with mellow coriander flavor lingering on the tongue.

Well, it took me far too long to get around to it, but I finally bucked up and grabbed a bottle of Hoegaarden (Pierre Celis is the former brewer).  Golden in color, sticky glorious head, the aroma immediately tells you that this is something special.  The coriander and orange peel hit you followed by the mellow sweetness of the wheat.  Its mouthfeel is smooth and velvety with a little zip on the end.  The blending of the spices with the highest quality wheat make for an over-the-top experience.

The heavy earthy nose is mostly of malt and suggests cereal and caramel, with hints of flowers, and citrus.

Not as much coriander and orange in this as some of the others I've had and the body was still a little light for me, but not bad. Definite warm weather beer.","aracauna","Mar 27, 2002"
4.28,13.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Nice frothy white head.  Cloudy white appearance as the name suggests.  I get wheat on the nose, but surprisingly, no spice.  Nice easy drinking wheat based bevarage.  This would be a great summertime beer.  I was hoping for a little more orange/coriander/spice in the taste, but it tastes very good as is.  There's that nice zesty, tangy character that goes great with pools and sunshine.","Bighuge","Mar 24, 2002"
3.38,-10.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This is a luscious refreshing white, good for a sunny Sunday brunch. Nothing extraordinary but decent, indicative of the style. Doesn't get superb marks from me because I inherently distrust Interbrew. Their beers suffer from the enormity of the company, and their costs are prohibitive. I once paid $9 ($10 with tip) for one of these in an annoying Manhattan bar/lounge, so I decided to keep the glass.","Thrasher","Mar 11, 2002"

4.4,16.4,4,4,5,4,4,"Great citrisy flavor form the hops and orange peel. Nice head and wonderful wheaty flavor. I only put 2 other whites ahead of this one but Hoegaarden definately has the best value.","mattmaples","Nov 21, 2001"
3.6,-4.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: The original White Ale, and grandfather to many a Summer-style white ale. Seems to have less character lately, though if you have it over in Belgium it is better.","Jason","Oct 19, 2001"
4.66,23.3,5,4,5,4,5,"Anyone who's had only American interpretations of Belgian Wit(white) beer before needs to try this. A real treat with a unique texture. Very flavorful.","John","Oct 01, 2001"
