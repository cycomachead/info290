"No foam and a cloudy yellow color.  The smell is sickly sweet, and the taste is slightly better.   The aftertaste is a bit cloying.   It's not bad for about 1/2 the bottle, but then it's just too much for me.   Just not my kind of beer, as I don't care for the sweetness that lingers.."

"O - Decent offering but not one that I will buy again.  Just not my type of beer.  Definitely fruity but pomegranate fruitiness overshadows all other normal aspects of a wheat beer.  3.25/5"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pomegranate, pear, apple, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with decent balance of pale malt, fruit, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. A bit too estery in the nose. Taste of lemon, pomegranate, pear, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity tartness and earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pomegranate, pear, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt, fruit, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a solid fruited wheat ale. Good robusntess and balance of pale malt, fruit, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."

"Taste / Palate: The flavor is a perfect copy of its aroma. This comes by way of a light feeling body with balanced carbonation. As it warms and take the last few sips I get a little more of the fruity pomegranate notes mixing with floral hop notes in the finish."

"Poured from bottle, a bright clear gold beer, some initial head but it fades quickly leaves little lacing. Smell is vaguely grapefruity, pomegranate, floral, raspberry. Light but with some artificial aspects to it and a pungent fruity character. Taste is light, pomegranate is foremost, syrupy almost, raspberry, a bit sweet but not too muc actually. The wheat base is mild and it is an easy drinking refresher. Light bodied with a mild carbonation, detectable wheat creaminess to it. I'm not crazy about this but don't hate it either, the pomegranate does come across strongly and feel a bit forced and artificial but as a complete package the beer is alright, dry citrus finish, not a ton of traditional flavours but hey this is meant to be pretty off the wall. Not something I'd drink everyday but could be different one to try. Light and mild, smell isn't great but the beer itself could be worse. Some lemon and pomegranate, maybe would make a good salad dressing?"

"Picked up as part of a mixed six as a what the hell because I tend to like wheat beers, even the fruit ones. Not much on appearance, kinda thin and not much head. Not much to speak about with smell. Taste was also disappointing. Overall not a real strong beer, decent but nothing special. Probably will not buy again. Of course, may be overly rough because I drank it right after a Weihenstephaner Heffeweisbier, so tough act to follow."

"O: Not horrible, but definitely not a Witbier. It wasn't funky enough for that. Passable."
""
"Overall, I liked this beer ok once I got into it a bit, as the sorta off-putting taste sensation dissipated or I got used to it.  I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but would look to other options if available."
"O: I thought that this beer had a good balance because the wheat flavors masked out any sweetness from the fruit. The beer is quite easy to drink."

"Pours a light cloudy gold. Frothy suds top the unfiltered pomegranate wit. Aroma of wheat and a hint of fruit. Interesting taste of tart Belgian yeast and wheat malt. There is a mild note of acidic fruit but really not discernibly pomegranate. Fair amount of earthy hop bitterness. Medium bodied feel and well carbonated. Overall, this is a decent beer, different from the usual wit."

"3.0 D: It's okay, but too many better options to buy again."

"Ground control to Major Tom, get yourself a new beer."
""
""
""

"O: Overall pretty good."
"Pours light bronze, hazy, with touches of white foam. Light fruity smell. Taste opens slightly sour from the fruit. Mild wheat. Tart balanced out by some awkward closing hop. Very light. Good fruit flavor. But not a huge winner."

"Served in a shaker at The Saucer on 4/7/13. Pours an almost flat golden-yellow favoring the flesh of a mango. There was a little haze to it, but it seemed more like something dirty floating in it than really a wit or hefe type unfiltered haze. There was no head to this beer. I watched the pour and it was done by one of the bartenders that knows how to pour a beer. He didn't not pour off the head. He poured it at about 75 degrees and it just formed nothing. The smell was just flat as well. There was tons of bubbles in the glass, so I didn't think it was a carbonation thing. There was maybe a whisper of fruit syrup and some maybe banana on top of some cheap white bread. The taste was just a bunch of nothing overall. I feared a flat beer given the head and the nose situation, but it was really quite fizzy; too fizzy really. There was something that maybe wanted to be pomegranate, but only came off as flavoring syrup. There was no wheat flavor at all and there was this harsh hops flavor to it as well; no flavoring hops, just a flat bitterness. Overall, this beer was just off. Sytlistically it just doesn't work right for either a wit or a true wheat beer. It really was like drinking a budweiser with some fruit flavor to it. I may give it another shot just to be sure, but I just didn't like it."

"Review 1/24/13-Well, for some reason, I got another and thought I would try it. Pours out to a lightly hazy peach. forming a small white head with poor retention and absent lacing. Carbonation is moderate ~2.5 carbs. The aroma is of grain husk and kiwi fruit. Mouthfeel is moderately tart with a light body. The taste is just grain husk, kiwi fruit, a weird moderate metallic bitterness and more sourness. Not a lactobacillus infected sourness, but a citric sourness. The bitterness certainly seems toned down compared to my prior review, but it's still pretty brisk considering the style and body."

"O: A great fruit based beer that is still a beer overall. This beer is well balanced."
""
"M: Light mouthfeel. Nothing left on the tongue. Not too effervescent. A very good summer beer, but I don't think I'd drink this if I weren't at a BBQ or on the beach."
""
""
""

""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amout of carbonation. A nice fruity summertime offering that isnt overdone with the fruit inclusion but the buttery notes need to go. There is a time and place for every brew, i enjoyed this while sitting on the beach. Under other circumstances maybe I wouldnt have enjoyed this as much as I did."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some pomegranate. Taste has some tangy wheat notes, pomegranate is present but not over powering. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"O: Definitely not a January beer, but I wasn't really in the mood for a porter or imperial stout. I need to study tonight. Wondering what else Fort Collins offers..."
""
"meant to be a summer beer, but im not sure i would even enjoy it then. smells sour from the pomegranate juice, and a little bready from the yeast. tart and off a little. taste is a more intense version of the smell, really funky juicy vibe clashing with a wheat base, not nice at all. these flavors are just not complimentary here. mouthfeel is fine, but the tartness sort of dries out the mouth, not what i would be looking for on a summer day here on the front range. for collins makes some excellent beer, but this isnt one of them"

"Out of a bottle this beer was a bright golden color with a white finger’s worth of head. The retention was not very good and it left thin bands of lacing. The aroma was of citrusy hops, tart fruit, pale malt and wheat. The flavors were very tart with notes of pomegranate, berries, citrusy hops and a twang of wheat. It tasted off to me, however, too tart and misbalanced. I wonder if it was not stored properly or just didn’t age well. I feel it should be better than the example I had. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, the body medium/light and the carbonation average."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a reasonable sized cream colored head that dissapates to a slight film over the brew. Light lacing. Berry aroma with light wheat. Reminds me of a fruit juice. The taste definitely displays some pomegranate, I think, but has a wheat backbone on the swallow. Tangy (almost harsh) finish with some rind-like characteristics. Juicy comes to mind as well. Overall I applaud the effort to add pomegranate to beer but this (and most fruit beers) was just so-so for me."
"Maybe if it was 80 and sunny right now, I could have enjoyed a few of these. For those looking for a fruit beer, or a wheat beer, or a session beer, or a...oh, hell! Just move on to something else. You probably couldn't do much worse - isn't that right Major Tom?"
"O- its a nice effort to combine the wheat with pomegranate but i dont think it works. It is a nice beer to give a try but i wont have another."
"Overall, this is an OK fruit beer. While I can't say I love it, it's more interesting than I thought it would be."
"D ~ I long for a little hops to play second note to the pomegranate. Overall a bland experience. Pomegranate in beer is a good idea, but this one needs major refining."
"Easy to drink, but nothing impressive."
"Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a small 1/2 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Distinct rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, spices, and crushed pomegranate arils. Taste is of wheat, bread, and some bitter pomegranate flavors on the finish. The bitterness is mild and quickly fades. The mouthfeel on this one is crisp and bubbly. Overall, this is a decent fruited beer with more of an emphasis on the bitterness found in some pomegranates rather than a sweetness."
"This brew poured out as a golden color with a white fluffy head on top. The lacing was minimal on this brew and not really that impressive. The smell of the beer was fruity and had some aromas of fresh grains in there too. The taste has a tart pomegranate flavor to it. The flavor also settles into a slight sweetness. The mouthfeel is light and pretty easy to drink. Overall this beer is a decent fruit beer, I'm not big on this specific fruit so I probably won't need to drink it again."
"Final thought - Not bad either"
"O- Great for a sweet fruity beer, which are usually not my favorite. Nice fruit taste, without all of the sugary rush that goes with it"
"O: Light refreshing beer to drink during a hot summer day. Would have liked more pomegranate flavor to come through."
"Overall: Not a bad little beer. I think the first sip you take the flavor kind of shocks the palate but each sip afterwards became more and more enjoyable"
"Dr: Maybe they should use real pomegranate juice instead of concentrate. It's very affordable here in Colorado but not horribly drinkable on account of the coarseness. It's worth a try, but I won't get it again."
"Poured golden with the barest touch of haze. Up front wheat character is clean and straightforward along the American Pale Wheat style. What I suppose is the pomegranate kicks in mid-way through, although I was not able to discern any particular flavor of that fruit. What did present was a bit artificial bittersweetness with the sweet aspect almost hinting at Belgian candy sugar (or immitation Belgian candy sugar). Drinkable, but not particularly enjoyable."
"O: This is a hot weather beer, and this is the only time I'd ever drink it, however there is a ton in the 'wit' category at a similar price that's better. The pomegranate adjunct could make it a try if you enjoy that fruit."
"Overall: Well, I wouldn't say it lived up to my expectations -- as mentioned, I was really hoping for a stronger fruit presence (kind of like how DFH does the Aprihop); decent flavors though in the end and it is a pretty refreshing summer drink. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down if someone offered it to me."
"Pours a golden yellow with little head. Nose offers wheat and yeast, but I don't pick up a strong fruit presence. Little if any pomegranate in the nose. Taste offers a little more fruit but mainly in the finish. The pomegranate is overall very faint. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. I was looking for a little more in this one, but not a bad beer for the summer."
"D-Eh, not a bad beer by any means, but I'm really not enjoying this one all that much. The pomegranate is barely there and fruit wheat beers aren't my favorite style."
"Pretty refreshing and drinkable, if not unremarkable. Decent summer beer here....not much to really think about when drinking it."
"Taste-Wheat, subtle fruit tartness, refreshing. Subtle flavors, nothing overdone. A decent, different, refreshing hot weather brew."
"Overall it is lacking smell, good in flavor, great in feel. Not a bad drink. I"
"This is my first review on this site so please if you have any advice message me thanks"
"Not sure if I'm being harsh on this one but first of all this is not a witbeer, no orange, no coriander and no yeast character whatsoever. In addition that sulfite addition is not adding to the illusion of pomegranate in this. It's an average wheat beer exposed to a chemistry fair volcano. On the brightside, FCB finally proves to me they can produce a beer that is actually carbonated. * golf claps*"
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger pure white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spices, and orange zest. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, fruit, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but that was about it. It was slightly spicy for the style or at least what I'm used in this style. Wasn't really sure what to make of it, good or bad. I honestly wouldn't have guessed this to be a Witbier but rather a Spiced/Herbed style. Highly doubt I will be having this one again."
"Tasty and refreshing enough, but nothing special, and in particular no real pomegranate flavors."
"overall if you'd like to try a pom wheat, i recommend Saranacs, ive heard FCB has good beers, but this missed the cut"
"The mouthfeel is fairly nice, it's crisp and well-carbonated. The drinkability? Eh, it's decent, but there's no reason. Overall? This is a bad beer. There's really nothing here to enjoy. I might have a bad bottle, because the floaties don't seem to be mentioned by any other review. I'd try it again, but wouldn't be fooled twice. Saranac's Pomegranate Wheat is much better."
"Golden with a bit of haze and plenty of carbonation. The head quickly disappears. Sweet honey like aroma. Good amount of carbonation on first sip. The fruit comes out in the middle with a bit of sourness. Nice amount of hops in the back. In the end the sour and bitter clash making for an odd finish. Medium body"
"It's a little thin on the mouthfeel, but high marks for drinkability, this one goes down easy and I could definitely go for more."
"D- Very drinkable and goes down easy."
"Value: Pricey as heck for what it is."
"A medium-bodied brew with a watery, dry finish. Medium effervescence. Overall, a decent beer but just a middle of the road one."
"Overall this was a disappointment, Not sure how a fruity ""wheat"" beer can be sweet and bitter? This could be better, pomegranate is a wonderful fruit to brew with. I use it once in a while in my homebrew witbier, and its great. With a little work they can greatly improve this beer."
"D: Ones plenty for me thanks, even by style and not enough to recommend even a single purchase here."
"Not really sure where this beer was going, but it seemed to fall flat other than an OK American Wheat Ale flavor. As for the fruit and sulfites, the fruit missed the mark, and why are sulfites used? Keep that to wine and cider please."
"Not sure how true this is to it's wheat lable, as I don't care for wheat's and I find this one quite likeable."
"So-so. Average wit but the pomegranate did nothing for me."
"D - Well thankfully I only had four of them which were not much of a chore to consume but I really would have rather had Saranac Pomme offering."
"Drinkability - An obvious easy drinker. A bit too tart for me for a witbier, but I can see the appeal."
"D: This beer honestly didn't do much for me. A bit too harsh in the middle for me to truly enjoy it. The lightness; however, makes it go down quick."
"I feel that these guys know how to make a great fruit beer, but this one isn't my favorite. I just wanted it lighter on the grain. Great use of pomegranate."
"Either way, I've said it before and I'll say it again. When a beer is mislabeled, or improperly categorized by the brewer, it will always receive low scores from me even if it does taste good. This is because if I'm in the mood for a stout, and I buy something labeled stout, I expect a stout. Likewise, I expected a wheat ale and I didn't get one. Therefore, I'm left disappointed. I don't mean this to offend, but its the truth. I honestly adore Fort Collins Brewery. Unfortunately, they have disappointed me with this offering."
"First sip is very sweet, with a bit of husky graininess on the aftertaste. No hops to speak of, not that they would be expected. Sweetness is very powerful, but not overpowering... there is a distinction. The pomegranate barely pokes through. There is a little too much residual sweetness for my liking, but I detect no off flavors or major negatives. This is just a beer that I only tried because I had it as part of a sampler. I wouldn't buy a sixer of this on its own, both before or after I've tasted it."
"D- Bitter and tart, no refreshing wheat character, and let me just say that pomegranate has no place in beer. This is pilot material, not the breweryflagship beer."
"Pours a fairly standard clear amber with a fairly thick and fluffy white head - typical, but not off-putting. Aroma is yeasty and wheaty with a decided fruity overtone. Flavor is mainly of pomegranate, which I love, and has malty and yeasty undertones. It is slightly sweet and slightly hop-bitter. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy, and it leaves an edgy, somewhat bitter aftertaste. Not great, but worth a try."
"Overall a pleasant surprise. It's not the predictable fruity wheat beer that I was expecting. A nice bit of bitterness and tartness gives it a real balance."
"Again, not a terrible beer (not a great one, either), just terribly mis-labeled."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a nice one finger head that stays around. The smell is very weak there is a bit of wheat and a slight sweet smell. The taste is enjoyable but not over powering, the taste is of a wheat backbone with a pom note over the top. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall its a very drinkable beer, the taste is smooth and subtle."
"Overall, I feel that this beer was a great purchase at $2.00 on the single rack. I don't see myself buying the 6-pack on a regular basis, unless it's spring... it's surely a light, and flavorful beer that would be better tasted during a season other than winter, still a great beer. Cheers."
"Wheat ale with pomergranate juice concentrate. Not exactly something I would seek to drink. It is an attractive beer with a clear golden body and large head that had good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of wheat malt and some fruit than I could not peg as pomergranate. The flavor is rather mild. Had a natural flavor as I was afraid that like a lot of added flavor beers, they taste artificial. Just a hint of pomergranate which also gives some bitterness. A lighter body and well matched carbonation. Feels right for the style. A decent beer and would be a good drinker on a hot day."
"Pours a clear, golden/orange color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight wheat, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, hops, sweet malt, slight citrus, and grain. Overall, an easy drinking beer, but not well blended and the grain leaves an odd aftertaste."
"Beer poured golden with a shade of red in the undertone. Nose is good, fruity with hints of floral hops. Taste is actually pretty good. The pom flavoring plays well as a bittering element in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, decently carbonated for a refreshing finish. Drinkability is pretty good as well. This is a nice twist on the wheat style of beer, not overly sweet. This is worthy of a shot."
"D - Definitely average"
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is one inch in height, snd recedes very quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is pale malt, and pomegranate juice. There is nothing in this aroma that indicates it is a wheat beer. The taste is like the aroma, but with a little wheaty tang. Still it leaves a lot to be desired. The mouthfeel medium-light bodied with a velvety texture, and moderately high carbonation. It is actually a really nice mouthfeel. Overall, this style of fruit beer is way overdone. This particular beer is average at best. I don't think I'll be drinking this again."
"D - really good, if in the mood for a touch of sweet."
"This is one of the better fruit-wheat beers I've had. I wasn't expecting much. I even though this was going to be old and stale, but it tastes quite fresh."
"Poured from the bottle into a weizen glass, beer must be a filtered Witbier because it is perfectly clear and golden in appearance with a thin, creamy looking cap. Looks more like a macro lager than a micro Witbier. The nose is surprisingly hop dominant with a mild, slightly toasted malt backdrop and only a faint whiff of fruitiness which I will attribute to the pomegranate. It is not much more apparent in the taste other than in the presence of a tart acidic flavor but the fact that it is pomegranate is indistinguishable. There is a definite wheaty-ness to it as well as a lightly toasted malt flavor - victory maybe? The beer is also well balanced with hops and finishes neutral with the tart acidity I previously mentioned. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin yet smooth and creamy carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer and not bad. My only let down with this beer is the advertisement of pomegranate which as I mentioned is indistinguishable. If they just called this ""Major Tom's Wheat Ale"" I think my opinion of it would have been much more positive."
"Overall this was better than I anticipated although I must say it's much better before it gets much above 50 deg F - drink this one fast."
"D - I am not generally a fan of fruit beer, but this the subdued sweetness and dry finish make this one very drinkable."
"D - A pretty original take on the wheat. Not bad by any means, just not quite what I seek in a beer. Pretty refreshing and drinkable overall, although I probably wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Super easy drinker. So smooth, very flavorful, I like this a whole lot better than most wits. Really, really nice summer beer."
"drinkabiltiy is so so - while it is not a bad tasting beer and i wuld never turn down a free one - overall its just blah"
"Taste was pretty clean, slightly fruity. Finished very clean and refreshing. Just enough flavor to keep it interesting. Great beer for summertime. Extremely drinkable and refreshing."
"I am always tentative with wheat beers, but this one is outstanding. It comes off as pale ale more than a wheat and that is probably why. Very good balance and taste. I think the overall rating is a diservice to its strengths and maybe I just got a good batch. I'll report back when I try it again if it's different."
"D: Could be very drinkable, but the pom is a little too bitter for my taste.... It is worth a try if you are looking for something a little different."
"D: As you go through the hop profile fades a little bit, and mellows. Maybe I just got used to the taste. Would be good for a cook-out, or the 4th of July... Something in warm weather. Not sure if I would buy this regularly though."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination, but the alcohol was a little too present. A pretty good example of the style. However, the alcohol, despite being low, was fairly present in the taste and aftertaste and I felt that took away a little bit from the experience of drinking this one as well as your ability to drink the style during the warmer days."
"D- The drinkability for this one is pretty good, it would make a solid session beer. Worth a shot."
"Pours a light straw golden slightly hazed with chill, bright white foaming head dwindles pretty quickly leaving behind even fine patterns of lace. Aromatics are not what I was expecting, fruit beers usually equate to sticky sweet messes in the smell. This smells like an actual beer, even has some hop aroma to it, nice. Pale cereal grains provided biscuit malt sweetness with a grassy background of hops and a mildly tart fruit pomegranate character going on. Flavor has the tart earthy sweet pomegranate extract twang but again it's all built upon a solid brewed beer, sharp wheat sweetness nothing too fizzy or cloying. Moderate balanced flow to it all it's sweet slightly tart with hop bitterness in the background finishing off the beer, a really even experience. Mouthfeel is not cloying or sticky with residual sugars, crisp sturdy carbonation but a very natural feel to it light to medium bodied overall, this is quality fruit beer. Drinkability, I enjoy everything Fort Collins is putting out, they make one of the best sampler packs out there every style comes to play and they do them quite well."
"D- meh, i guess fruited wheats just arnt for me. i dont think ill be checking this one out again. it isnt offensive, its just not my thing."
"D - Not bad. At first I though this beer was fairly awful, but by the end of the glass it had grown on me. The fruit flavor is pleasant and actually blends well with the wheat. I still can't say I am a fan of fruited wheat beers, but this is drinkable."
"Enjoyed on tap at 303 Cafe in East Boston."
"Drinkability: A light wheat ale with a light addition of fruit, charge it with an ample hop bitterness and nigh fizzy carbonation and you have yourself Major Tom's Pomegranate Wheat."
"Overall: I really liked this beer and will have many again. Will be especially nice on hot summer day."
"Pours light amber with no head. Not quite what I expect from a wheat beer. Smells of artificial fruit, sugar, and some sour- like a cheap candy. Similar in the mouth. Starts bitter and artificial and progresses to thin, watery, sour, and insipid with a metallic tang on the finish. Sharp and prickly in the mouth, this one is a drain pour for me."
"D: Just a little too sour/tart for me. Has a strong grapefruit character, and I wish the pomegranate would have shined more. Not as smooth as typical wheats."
"Amber yellow with some visable suspended particles and a massive foamy head that leaves nice lacing. Smells kind of bitter & fruity, must be the pomegranate in there, also some caramel maltiness. Tastes weird as the bitterness comes from the actual fruit instead of hops tasting like grapefruit. Not terrible tasting but not true to the style at all. Are we sure this is a witbier? Seltzery slick mouthfeel. A strange brew."
"D: Easy drinking; a nice summer beer though the sweetness may get tiring. Strangely enough, not real smooth going down."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very mild kick, not a good representation of style, there just wasn't very much in this beer that I found favorable."
"Okay, i don't know about this one. the pomegranite juice is prominate in this beer. almost too overpowering. I really could deal without drinking this one. I believe my friend and I had about the same reaction to this beer. Let me try something else. Not the worst beer in the world mind you."
"I dont know what it is, but this is my second FCBC beer and both have been horrible (Summer Fling is the other). This one does not taste at all like pomegranates, nor does it have much of a noticeable wheat crispness or zing. There is a very good chance this will be my last Fort Collins beer, just atrocious."
"D- Not a beer I would buy again."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability with this is fine but not something I would seek out, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Drinkability: so-so in my book as this did not refresh nor did it excite the tastebuds."
"The mouthfeel is slick and oily. Where's the wheat? The hops are overly prominent, and the fruit is intense. This is not a witbier. It's not bad, but it's not a wit."
"The taste is crisp and typical of a wheaty beer, but where is the pomegranate? There is a slightly sweetish tint to the beer, that segues into a more dryish and crisp tartness as the beer settles, but I'm just not getting loads of pomegranate. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. The beer is a decent, slightly sweeter than normal wheat beer, with a tartness and a crispness that is its defining qualities. It's an okay beer, and that's all one can say."
"D_Too bitter and funky for immediate repeats. I appreciate this beer, but I don't want to have more than one"
"pours a transparent yellow orange color with an enormous white head. Aromas of soap and artificial fruit in the nose, pomegranate sure doesnt jump out at you, more like over ripe and sour plums, green apple and tart berry. Tart in the mouth as well, fake fruit concentrate again dominates the flavor here, tingly with a metallic taste on the tongue. No true pleasurable wheat character to speak of and an ear wax like aftertaste. Avoid this beer, if you must drink a fruit beer there are better options than this."
"Pours a clear yellow/honey color with a smallish white head. Not a really great looking brew. The smell is weak with only some sweet malt and bread yeast present. The taste is crisp with sweet malt ,bread yeast and some fruit flavors. The m/f is light with the scant flavors mixing OK. Not a bad beer,but from Fort Collins I would expect more."
"Tasted 7/30/08."
"This beers body is blonde and hazy. There is a lot of head but not much for lace. It has wheat and fruit aroma so I guess one could say it is true to its style. I thought it did not taste like a wheat beer at all it was more like pale ale in taste. It has a very sweet and tart flavor. It is refreshing and light and I would recommended it for a summer beer."
"Easy and light aroma of malts and Pomegranate (kinda of a spicy orange / mango) in this one, quaff is exactly the same. Light and easy drinking, a very nice summer brew to quaff in the heat. A very nice cross-over, ""try this"" one beer. No problem sipping on a sixer."
"D- This beer doesn't have any major flaws it is just bland. There are no real yeasty characteristics or wheat or hop flavors."
"Now this beer is not offensive but I just fail to see any upside to it. The color a golden clear beer. No wheat beer haze or large fluffy head. The scent is sour atop a whiff of malt sweetness. Not smooth or tart but oddly sour in an unpleasant way. The taste is similar with little complexity or depth of character. Mouthfeel is thin. I would not drink another."
"body seemed to be close to medium. had a hard time getting through this one."
"Pours a clear pale orange with plenty of bubbles rising quickly to the top and forming a one-finger off white and quickly receding head. The bubbles continue for a while. There is no head retention to speak of. I get some corn, straw and an aroma of biscuits and honey on the nose. Tastes malty and sweet with a bit of lemon and possibly pomegranate (makes sense) thrown in a slightly bitter finish. It's crisp, but has a certain almost indiscernible breadiness that rounds off the edges. A good wheat beer that could probably use a bit more gusto in the taste department, but will go a long way toward whetting the whistle when that's all you need."
"Cheers!"
"Golden straw colored in my SA beer drinking glass. Bright 2 fingers of luscious white froth. Definitely pick up some pomegranate on the nose, with a touch of corrainder. More pomegranate on the 1st few sips, but surprisingly not overwhelming. A good amount of wheat taste with some zesty hops. Light berry fizz in the mouth, finishes rather dry. Very light in the body, clean and refreshing."
"Medium-bodied with ok carbonation and drinkability."
"good carbonation. easily drinkable. i like the beer. i could do a session. the pomegranate designation does not fullfill. i would like to have this unfiltered also."
"I actually went so far as to visit the Brewery's site, where I can find no claim of its ""whit"" status. So - hard to dock points for straying from a style. Not necessarily ""the most unique beer you will ever try," as Fort Collins Brewing claims, but a very enjoyable beer, nevertheless."
"D: This wouldn't be a bad session beer really. It was worth a shot, and not too bad. 3.0"
"Overall, a good fruit beer. I love pretty much all the FCB beers and this one doesn't disappoint for what it is. Fruit beers are good on-offs for me but not session or several times a year. With that said, I'd be happy to get a few of these a year."
"Pours a clean yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, a nice fruitiness (pomegranate), and wheat notes. In the taste, fruity, pomegranate notes, mainly a dry wheat flavor. A fruity bite, and a light bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. A nice fruitiness in a nice wheat beer."
"D - This reminds me of tart lemonade with a pomegranate splash."
"Clear golden body with a pleasant consistent bubble; thin white head leaves appropriate tracings down the flute... spritzy, sprightly fruity scents--subtly appealing... smooth up front, with an IPA-like trail off... unique indeed--a bit spritzy upon further drinking... I still don't know what pomegranate tastes like, but this has subdued citricity that settles tartly under the tongue... refreshing and light--a good combination for summer consumption... like a light, less candified, wheatier lambic."
"D: Very high. They say on the box that this is made to be a session beer, and it certainly lives up to that. I could drink a sixer no problem on a warm afternoon."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Looks and smells like a witbier, but the taste isn't really close. Slightly sweet, but not enough of the wheatiness I look for in a wit. Lacking in just about every category. I like wit's, I like pomegranate, but I tend to not like fruity beers as they usually overdo it (see: Sam Adams Cherry Wheat). This one had a modest fruitiness, which was good, but not enough of the wheat."
"D - Pretty Nice Beer again for the Summer outdoor activities."
"Served in a glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer poured a clear medium straw, forming a 1 inch white head, creating light lace as it faded. The aroma is very grainy and only has a hint of any wheat qualities. Taste follows closely, having a very pronounced almost BMC graininess to it, along with a light wheat flavor, and absolutely no hint of pomegranate anywhere. The mouthfeel is very light and smooth, more like a lager. This beer just seemed to be lacking in flavor, and in no way resembled any wheat beers that I know of. Very dissapointed."
"Really digging this beer-especially considering it is a fruit beer. Never particularly fond of fruit beers. Heavy on the wheat flavor with just the slightest hint of pomegranate. Which is a good thing because I am not fond of pomegranate juice. Some oily flavors that really do stick well together. Medium mouthfeel that has some heft to it actually. Kind of pleasantly surprised by that. Will definitely have to buy this on again."
"All in all I'd have to say that I would get this again, especially when served cold on a hot day."
"Drinkability - not my kind of beer, pomegranate for all it's anti-oxidant porperties, does nothing for me as an additive."
"Drinkability: As there's no dating anywhere, I have no idea how idea my bottle is, the flavor could just be gone. I wouldn't drink this again, and probably wouldn't have finished this had I not had the real pomegranate juice. A disappointment compared to the others in the Brewer's Lunchbox."
"Poured clear and blonde, with carbonation rushing up the top of the beer, and a small white head that quickly left a lace around the edge. Looked good enough. The smell was wheaty, with a mixture of hops and sharp fruit tones that gave a little bit of a pleasant stinging sensation to the nose. The taste was wheat and hops (surprisingly, the latter came out stronger), and some complimentary tart fruit along for the ride, which obviously included pomegranate, but also might have had some citrus in there. The hops and the dry, carbonated mouthfeel gave the beer a bit of a crips bite. I enjoyed the taste at first sip, but as I drank more, I liked it less. The tart flavors just got more and more sour to me, the beer a bit too carbonated, and I had enough by the end."
"This one didnt do it for me. Not horrible, not a repurchase."
"Drinkability: Very good. A nice quencher that does disappoint with it's lack of pomegranate flavor. Overall a decent beer."
"Pours a very lightly hazey banana with small, sluggish bubbles rising to the surface of a well foamed beer. Very little lacing. The aroma is a very faint, yet sharp fruit. The first sip is a tart fruity, pomegranate with a bone dry hop finish. Very light bitterness overall, but its there at the end. Helps round out the whole brew. Very dry palate mixed with sharp pomegranate fruit flavors."
"This is much better than I thought it would be. It is easy to drink with some complexity. I'll buy this again."
"Can't really complain as it's not the artificial-like syrupiness that many fruit wheat beers have. Still in all, it's a pretty typical American wheat ale."
"D-A bit light and ""odd"" for my tastes....but overall nice. This is a great stepping stone beer or a nice one to have at a summer BBQ. Light and refreshing with a low ABV makes it easy to have multiples."
"The body is crisp but still has some presence. Some yeast bite but overall not had. Overall limited in flavor and would like more of a fruit nose/flavor for a fruit beer (not wit)."
"Poured crystal clear medium yellow, which surprised me. With the pomegranate, I kind of expected it to be red or pink! Nice fluffy head and great lacing. Hardly any detectable aroma. Taste was interesting. Had to take a few drinks to decide if I liked it or not. Not fruity tasting, which is good. I think the pomegranate adds a little tartness to the bitterness of the hops, and it has a kind of sharp crisp flavor, almost a little like a sweet tart with the sweet left out of it. Mouthfeel was average, with medium carbonation and medium light body. Actually a pretty drinkable beer. Might surprise somebody who's expecting a fruity beer - like me."
"Poured dark yellow with a tall bright white head. Nose of sweet tarts and sour grapes, with a standard witbier spicy wheat backbone. Taste is tart grapes, green apples and cherries, with wheat and corriander. It is a little on the thin side to me. While it tasted ok it is not smoething I will seek out."
"D - I really liked this one. I scored it a little low only because I think it's too hoppy for the style and what most would expect a wheat to have. I liked the hop level, though. Recommended."
"Not one I will be looking for on the next beer run...but might keep in mind for a barbecue."
"The taste lacks the carbonated bite, citrus and other fine characteristics that I like in this style. The malt is there, but this is mostly grainy. The only reason I gave this the grade I did was that it was not bad to drink, just didn't follow the genre."
"Feel and drinkability are both just ""okay"". I'm not a huge wheat fan, and this one doesn't help my feelings about them. A rather disappointing showing to be honest. However, I'm betting at the abv and style, this would make a very nice summer guzzler."
"D - I wasn't too sure after the first bottle, but the next day I had changed my mind and found it quite enjoyable, even in the blustery-winter weather. A unique addition to their sampler case."
"standout beer, as there's really no depth to it."
"Pours a fogged golden amber with a big head off a firm pour that falls thin pretty quickly. Nose is barely there. Seems to be a very elusive whiff of fruit, and that's all. Flavor is slicky sweet with what one would guess to be the pomegranate , but doesn't really seem like it too much. I am sure it is just another pouring of syrup into the beer kinda thing. At least this one has some decent wheat character to it. And it seems like the warmer it gets, the more even it becomes. I am actually sitting here thinking that I might give a 4 on flavor, so I will. That surprises me as most of these pomegranate wheats just end up being totally weak. This one at least has some positive attributes. Feel is a bit of a tingle on the tongue from carbonation and who knows what else. Liquid is kind of doughy. This ends up being pretty drinkable actually. Though it seems to be better warmer than cold."
"Something that I would definitely like to try more of, and would probably make a nice session beer for a ball game over summer."
"Overall I never know what to expect when I see these hybrid styles with weird fruit added in, but this one was actually very good. It was like a nice light wheat ale, mixed with a ton of bright hops and with an added little bit of fruit. Not bad at all I would have to say. I would defiantly try this one again and would actually like to pick up more then one next time I see it."
"D: Has all the makings of a good summer session beer. Light on the taste though. If this was cheaper I would pick it up regularly for friends that are not really into craft beer."
"A light colored barely hazy beer with a thin, whispy white head that leaves some lace on the glass. Smells fairly bare with some weak tinny/fruity odors. Tastes pretty good. I'd say it's a good warm weather beer as it isn't overly complex. It has some sweet flavor, but nothing really like pomegranate. The hops are downplayed significantly. In the end it's a very light, good flavored beer that I think I could enjoy more in the summer."
"d: The pitfall of most fruit beers is too much sweetness. This beer avoids it. The pomegranate is pretty mild, it doesn't dominate the beer, but instead serves as a nice accent. Overall, not too bad. Would be a good summer session beer."
"The brew was a crisp, light straw color with a slight haze to it. Like most flavored beers, the pomegranate was fairly light,but suprisingly pleasant. Mouthfeel was a little on the dry side, but other than that, this beer was very refreshing. I could see it being a great summer beer for Coloradoans, besides Coors Light. LOL!"
"Light bodied, drinkable, though maybe a bit tart for some. Worth a try, especially as a warm weather cooler."
"The odd pommegranite never makes much of a presence beyond general fruitiness, and the base Witbier flavors are lackluster and of marginal quality- both aspects leave this beer subpar and less interesting than that of Bell's Oberon or the like."
"D - This is a pretty good beer with a fruit flavor. It is one of the better beers with pomegranate."
"Hazy, straw yellow body with a small white head that leaves some skimpy lacing on the glass. Aroma is muted, with some tart pomegranate and wheat malt. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Taste is bready wheat, some bitter citrusy hops, and a sour/sweet pomegranate taste. This one is better executed than the other pomegranate beers I've tried but I'm still not convinced that the fruit is suitable for such a union."
"D- It was an ok beer but I wouldn't have it again."
"D: This is a pretty good lawnmower ale, excellent for a steamy hot August day like today."
"An alright wheat/fruit beer, but maybe I was spoiled by Southern Tier's Hop Sun this summer. An ok experience, but I probably won't be back."
"This was a really tasty session brew. Smells of some citrusy lemon. Pours nice head and laces beautifully down the glass. The edges are a little rough and somewhat unrefined. Some of the tastes don't mesh with me well(a little unbalanced, lots of flavor going on), but they all taste nice in an of themselves..if you cut me some slack..But a nice session beer that I will be having again."
"This pours a slightly cloudy yellow and slightly gaseous. During the pour, the head was fluffy and taller than I expected. The bouquet did not seem to reveal the pomergranate in the beer. The same goes with the taste. I was expecting a little more fruit. This beer is pretty easy drinkin' and sure to be a hit with the ladies. Oh well, off to the collection with the bottle."
"A nice orange beer with a fair head and some lacing. Hoppy smell with pomengranete as well. This beer favors a pale ale more than a wheat. The taste reveals the hops and more pom, and is somewhat bitter. The mouthfeel is fair. This beer is a fairly hopped brew with pom flavors that I could drink again. A nice suprise!!"
"Overall a interesting take on a wheat beer. The promogranate certainly adds to the overall flavor."
"I expected a touch more pomegranate taste added by a little sweetness. What I got was a drab beer with a hint of pomegranate, and a very low alcohol content. I like a little alcohol in my beer, and I don't think I would of bought it if it had the 4.8 % on the bottle or 6 pack."
"Not a bad beer ...this has the taste of your everyday run of the mill beer with what kind of tastes like a peach aftertaste.I wouldn't go out of my way to get another one considering price and low abv.But this is something unique and I don't want to bash it. My advice is to try it. It's not great but descent."
"This one, as it pulls the reins on the pomegranate, chokes out the beer as a whole. These guys make great stuff, though, so chalk it up to a good effort and incomplete execution."
"I find it ironic that Fort Collins Brewing brings out such a terrific Maibock in April, and then follows it up with this very unimpressive fruit beer in May. They need to take this one back to the drawing board and redesign it."
"Interesting! A refreshing take on ""fruit beer"" that's surprisingly drinkable. A great summer beer to be sure!"
"Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied with a slightly bitter, mildly tart, slick, smooth, and semi-dry."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Really nice amber-peach color, decent amount of light head. Really beautiful. S: Pomegranate really coming through with the wheat, some malt in there with just a touch of soapiness, minimal hops. T: The wheat hits you first followed very loudly by the pomegranate, a fruity-bitter finish, the hops dont really seem to jive with the overall character very well. Very citric. M: Moderate to high carbonation, fairly thin otherwise. D: It could be that I just dont like pomegranate, but I didnt really take to this very much. Its definitely interesting and the slight wheat flavor works nicely with the tartness, but the pomegranate is so overwhelming it was hard to fully enjoy. Definitely worth a try, if only for the novelty."
"Drinkability: Very high. I will definitely buy this again (I only bought a single bottle). The promegranate has a wonderfully dry finish without overpowering the beer flavor."
"Poured a hazy pale orange with a decent off white head. The aroma was a good blend of light wheat malt and strong fruit. The pomegranate was very present along with some other fruits such as banana. The pomegranate dominated the palate and added an excellent touch to the style. The beer was light bodied and decently carbonated. I'm not the biggest fan of witbiers, but the addition of pomegranate makes this one stand out."
"Good for summer."
"A true Colorado Native, Enjoy with a group of friends on a hot day!"
"A Christmas gift, I had never heard of this beer. The first one was just ""weird"" tasting to me, but the 2nd and 3rd have been all right. I think I'm getting used to the pomegranates or something!"
"I think I've only had one other pommegranate/wheat combonation, but remember it being much more flavorfull and robust. This one however is very drinkable and refreshing, and would probably make for a great yardwork/lawnmower beer."
"Body is light and fizzy, too light, and too fizzy. Soda-like mouthfeel. I guess i could see drinking this very cold after mowing or something."
"Explodes out of bottle with a five+ finger white head that fades to a shallow layer leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Fruity nose, is this what pomegranate smells like? Starts tart and fruity, different, can't really detect any wheat, tart almost sour finish. This would be a good summer beer. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"Thanks, oxymoron"
"Bottom line: An unusual, and good, enough taste to visit again and...the label is really cool looking."
"I'm surprised that Major Tom's is Fort Collins Brewing's best seller. I can't believe there are that many people who enjoy the taste of pomegranates in their beer. This bottle was enjoyable enough, but now that my curiosity has been satisfied, I won't be drinking this one again. Definite points for originality though."
"Mouthfeel is nothing spectacular. ON a warm day I could drink this all day. Defenitely an interesting take on fruit infused wheat beers."
"M/D- A great summer beer....on the heavy side of a light body, refreshing....very drinkable."
"Pours a clean yellow straw color with a white, moderately dense head. Not a lot of staying power. Sporadic lacing. Nose is not of wheat, but I do detect some fruity character here ... could be the pomegranate, I recon. Hops seem to be prominent too. Palate is interesting, to say the least. This is a wheat beer? I don't taste the wheat, and for that matter, I don't taste anything that I'd classify as a pomegranate flavor either. This is one of the strangest brews I've tried. Tastes more like a medium-bodied lager, or maybe a Kolsch, than it does a wheat ale. There is an off flavor here too, which I can't identify. Slightly sweet, with a medium/light mouthfeel. Rather high carbonation, and a slightly bitter finish. Lacks substance. I have to confess I was way underwhelmed with this beer. I managed to finish 2/3 of it and poured the rest. A Witbier classification? I don't think so. Despite this brew, I'm anxious to try some of the other offerings from Fort Collins Brewery."
"After one of these, I wanted to move on to something else. Not that it's a bad beer, in fact, it's fairly interesting, just not overly refreshing."
"12 ounce bottle with a yellow label of a bi-plane."
"Light yellow-orange in color. Seemingly filtered clarity. Subtle aroma, which is slightly tart, while yielding a base of aromatic honey and mild fruit. Equal balance between the sweet and sour flavors, while avoiding being overly cloying like I was expecting. Tastes fairly substancial for its size and its style. Their goal was to appeal to the Sunshine wheat and Easy Street Wheat fans and they achieved their goal, because this beer is better than both."
"Too swet strange and tasty to do more than one. Fruit beer lovers may think different"
"clear, yellowy drink with a big white head. looks like a hefe. smells like apples and sour wheat and i presume like pomegranates as well but i'm really just not around them enough to know for sure. tastes fruity and sweet. fruit (apple, pom) flavor is a bit cloying and distracting. very thin mouthfeel. not very good drinkability because it just didnt seem like i was drinking any kind of beer."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice tart and fruity wheat scent along with a slightly earthy yeast aroma. The taste is excellent. It has a fruity wheat and yeast flavor that is a bit tart and grainy. It goes down easy with a wonderfully smooth finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine wheat beer. I love the taste of this beer. This is another quality offering from Fort Collins."
"Edit: This is a witbier? I don't think so. Typical wit characteristics - like spicy coriander and a strong citric character - are missing."
"myself."
"For some reason this reminded me of Gumballhead. Obviously, the wheat character had a lot to do with that, but the fruit and mild hops as well..it tasted like it could be Gumballhead's little brother...if David & Golaith were brothers, I guess. Cheap and fairly unique, worth a try if you find it."
"The mouthfeel is very citric. Quite astringent on the mouth. The body is fairly light. As much as I like the taste, and as little as the alcohol content probably is (listed as unknown at time of review), I probably couldn't drink more than a few of these in a row in a single night before I got sick of the flavor. I'm sure this beer would be great in the summer, and in moderation... like an ""I just finished some yard work"" afternoon refresher."
"This is the definition of a good fruit beer. Unique, not too sweet, still managing to taste like beer. Very nice."
"A good summertime break, interesting fruit melodies that I would not have expected. I ejoyed the tartness and found this to be satifying overall, yet not completely extravagent."
"Pours an ominous Mt. Dew neon yellow/green with a tall bright white head. Smells of sweet tarts and sour grapes, with a standard witbier spicy wheat backbone. Taste is tart grapes, green apples and cherries, with wheat and corriander. As my compadre battlekow told me, kind of tastes like a carbonated sports drink with some mouth-puckering tartness. Mouthfeel is crisp and drinkable, I can see myself downing a few but after a while I think my mouth would be tired with more than that. A decent balance of sweet, spicy and tart here. Really not as fruity as you would think. This is a unique brew worth trying if you can find it."
"Major Tom's pours a straw gold color with a huge, gorgeous white soapy head. Looks very inviting. Smells wheaty and sour. I don't detect any fruitiness in the nose; however, there is some in the flavor, which I assume is pomegranate (I've never tasted the fruit itself). It's sweet but tart, and balanced perfectly with the beer's chewy wheatiness. Major Tom's tastes really fucking good--I think I've found my new favorite lawnmower beer. Seems like an APWA, though, not a witbier. Turns out that the website wasn't bullshitting."
"Nothing stands out about this beer and I would not go out of my way to try it again. There are better fruit beers out there."
"Interesting enough but one of these is all I'd want...nice stab at something a little different though...glad I tasted it..."
"Had this at the brewery yesterday. Appearance is amber with not much foam or lace. Aroma has lemon, eucalyptus, yeast and faint malt and hops. Initial taste is a like a cherry Sweet Tart. On the tongue there are hints of fruit that I could not definitely say was pomegranate, though I take their word for it. It seemed to need some adjusting to make it a drinkable beer. No reference to the David Bowie song is found on the label."
"There is a glimmer of promise here. The concept is interesting, even if the result is not. This needs some form of dryness and probably some complimentary spice notes. But with some tweaking, who knows?"
"Overall impression: Nicely drinkable beer with a twist. Interesting offering that is a bit different, but not just a novelty."
"Overall, a very fruity wit. It was very refreshing and would make a great summer drinker. It was one of the better wheats I've had (not a favorite style). I was surprised to like it as much as I did."
