A little spice (coriander?) does not really stand out but lingers.  Very tasty, refreshing and easy to drink.  Optimal summer beer.  A little thin or maybe I would say flat.  Extremely enjoyable beer that I would gladly enjoy at anytime.  If you like wheat/hefe/wit this is a good one, if you want hop move on.","JamieDuncan","Nov 27, 2014"

The carbonation looks so lively; like an alka seltzer tablet was dropped inside! Aroma is citrusy and sugary  sweet, especially orange. Not surprising considering the bottle says it was brewed with orange peel. Tasty is mostly citrusy and orange sweet. A very refreshing taste, like an orange soda. (I mean this in a good way) Feel is creamy and smooth. The carbonation really settles and there is very little left towards the end of the beer. I drank this on a super cold east coast mid November evening. I could see how this beer would be even better in the summer. However, I had it with a light and healthy meal of broiled salmon, Brussel sprouts and pear salad and they complemented each other nicely.","Gajo74","Nov 19, 2014"

There is a slightly sour component to it. Strong malty, banana taste up front, follow by moderate carbonation, with a spicy coriander taste at the end. Very refreshing beer. High carbonation. Witbiers were my first foray into craft beers (Hoegaarden), but I have moved on to other tastes, mainly hoppy IPAs and Pale Ales.

I think I would want to have just slightly less carbonation to emphasize the unfiltrated nature rather than seem to diminish its effects. As I kept drinking this and the carbonation started to come out of the beer, it started tasting more how I wanted it to.

Anyway, this stuff pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, coriander, clove, lemon zest, and a pinch of black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis placed on the spices, though the lemony wheat surely isn't mild. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish.

The taste is good and quite exquisite by the fruity estery touch leading by banana, orange peel along with some spice from coriander and clove. Hop plays behind a curtain by adding vague bitterness. Medium in term of body rejuvenating the palate with lively carbonation and dry finish, on-tap makes it much fresh, fruity, sweet and mellow, my salutation for the brewer making this thing out so simple but same time with many details to challenge the taste buds.","Everydayoff","Jul 26, 2012"

No CANsualties were reported and soon I had what CAN only be described as Lemon Meringue Pie in a glass! I was looking at a finger of flluffy, dense, bone white head with excellent retention above a cloudy pale-lemon yellow liquid. Nose was quite musty, very yeast-driven. Mouthfeel was creamy, like soft serve ice cream or instant pudding and the taste was of bananas and old newspapers, very musty. Wild! Finish was semi-dry and the mustiness really lingered, plus a lemony tartness began to come through.

Cookie dough, coriander, earthy herbal hints a very complex witbier, this may change some minds about the style. Spicy yeast complexity with a touch of acidity rising out of my glass. Flavors are bright with apricot, lemon and a creamy wheat flavor that really balances things out along with yeast esters and spice additions especially the coriander. Actually leaves ample bitterness with the spice, lingering on definitely complex. Mouthfeel is creamy texture, medium bodied tight flowing carbonation.

I think I pick up more orange/orange peel in the flavor of this beer compared to the other witbiers I've had in the past. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and pretty easy to drink.

When you take a sip, the sourness from the aroma show’s itself slightly in the taste, but isn’t overpowering. Once that fades, you get an enjoyable balance between lemon and citrus that’s light in body and leaves the tongue clean.

A very nice orange, citrus flavor at first up front with a muted hop and coriander spice flavor on a distant sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but would have to swirl the glass a few times to get that effect, otherwise is was a tad bit thin. Good drinkability.

Coriander and wheat are noticeable on the palate, with barley in the middle and orange showing up later. Very tasty, but way too mild.

Very bready and richly flavored with hints of lemon zest, acidic citrus notes, and with an earthy, pungent, herbal hop character that rounds out the sweetness but also gives a less-than-clean distraction. Heavier weighted than most Witbiers, but much maltier too with some unresolved sugars. Finishes sweet and spicy with a lingering hop, lemon, and bready note.

About 1/4 inch bright white head sticks around as well as to the sides of the glass as it goes down. Nice texture, smooth. The flavor of yeast isn't overbearing, yet it is still a big player in the flavor of the beer. Subtle coriander and citrus poke through, although it doesn't quite taste as well placed as some Wits I've had before. A good sessionable, cheap belgian wit. Not shabby.","Rudgers73","Nov 19, 2007"

Lightly perfumy aroma amidst a healthy dosage of tart citrus, coriander and unmalted+malted wheat. Lightly dusty in taste, this witbier has all the qualities of a summertime champion. Semi-sweet maltiness with the light spicing you'd expect from a witbier with a slight suggestion of vanilla nearer the finish. Citrus comes into play, but not as pronounced in flavor as some other witbiers. Nice creamy mouthfeel. I'm surprised I haven't noticed this one before.","crookedhalo","Aug 24, 2007"

Smells really sweet and fruity with a hint of Evangeline Maid white bread, which is kind of nauseating. Citrus stands out more than coriander. Tastes candy sweet and reminds me of cotton candy in the flavor (or, better yet, cotton candy flavored Bubble Yum). Coriander comes out a bit more than in the aroma, but the citrus is ever present. Really, there isn't much more I get from this, and, seriously, that cotton candy bubble gum flavor is out of control. Too much of that white bread thing is making me gaggy.

All in all the aroma is rather simple and slight. On the palate, very brisk acidity that is unbalanced with spicy softness. Some banana flavors pop up, but from the mid-palate on this beer is pretty watery and bland, and provides nothing to impress. The finish is a touch sweet and vinous.

The smell had the expected coriander and orange peel but the orange had a different smell that other wits. Not sure if they used another type of orange or what but it wasn't all that pleasing so a little hit on the smell score.

The aromas that came from the glass were of bananas, spices, light malt, citrus  lemons, and fresh baked wheat bread. The tastes were almost exactly the same. Flavors of bananas and cloves (like a creamy banana cream pie), sour lemons (light), pepper, hops, grain (like a wheat field), and a hint of alcohol all rolled over my tongue.
