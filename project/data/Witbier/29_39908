Had this at Buffalo Wild Wings and I gotta say, this beer goes perfect with spicy food. It doesn't have any really strong flavors, and it's not bitter at all. Slightly sweet and very carbonated. It goes down almost like water. It'd be great for mowing the lawn or going out on a boat, or maybe for cookouts. I like this quite a bit.","FrostyStephen15","Mar 28, 2015"

And perhaps the head retention and lacing could be a little better, but I still think it's pretty good for the style. It's a bit malty, mainly wheaty in the aroma, but there's still some coriander to it, as well as orange peel, and all of that carries into the flavor as well. It's rounded and balanced. It might be fuller than I'd expect, but there are other American breweries doing the same. Blue Moon is much heavier, and scores better, and there are a lot of brewpubs and smaller micros in the same boat. Besides all of that, it's clean and consistent. I think it's just getting a bad rap here because it's made by A-B.","NeroFiddled","Oct 15, 2014"

3,2,,,,,,"A standard you see a lot of places and it really hits the ""okay"" rating pretty spot on. Not great, but not terrible either. Appearance is a hazy light yellow with a fizzy head. The smell was a lot of orange peel and other citrus. The taste was similar with a lot of orange and then a little bit of wheat and yeast underneath. Mouthfeel was pleasant. Overall, a beer I wont say no to, but probably wont be picking up a case anytime soon.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 26, 2014"

With this beer it is important that you pour the beer into a mug except for about an inch of beer in the bottle. At this point you need to swish around the beer in the bottom of the bottle to get the sediment out and dump into your glass. You will have a much better tasting beer.

3.12,6.1,3.75,3.5,2.75,3,3.25,"Poured into a weizen glass. This is so ubiquitous I've wanted to try it for a while. Pours a hazy, light golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, light citrus and a hint of Belgian yeast. Flavor is washed out orange, mild wheat and hints of coriander. Finishes with an odd light coriander, mild citrus with a hint of hops. Light bodied. Well, the looks and aroma gave me hope and I was prepared to be pleasantly surprised, but this was as expected a washed out version of the witbier style. The flavors are there, but associated with citrus that tastes like watered down orange juice or one of those old, dried oranges that have lost their bright taste. The flavor is so attenuated that the coriander tastes out of place in the finish. I would not buy this again and don't see the point of brewing it. The nice interplay of wheat and spices from witbier are missing here. Like most AB products, harmless enough to finish, but no reason to repeat.","LiquidAmber","Mar 06, 2014"

The addition of the Shock Top in a black and tan brings about some flavors reminiscent of one of those orange chocolate candies. Shock Top alone is nothing special, with some lemony-orange, and grassy tones, and easy drinking, but nothing too distinctive. The two combined are really quite nice, since the chocolate flavor is tough to subdue, and the Shock Top quiets it down a bit while adding some citrus notes. The number ratings are for the Shock Top alone, however. If I could rate them together, I would probably add a quarter or half point in each category.","archyquaffer","Jan 28, 2014"

3.21,9.2,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"This beer gets a mention in Stan Hieronymus' ""Brewing With Wheat"" as an example of what happens when a large brewery tries to market a traditional beer style to the general public (successfully, if sales are any indicator. Of course they aren't, at least where quality is concerned). The recipe is in fact rather interesting, deviating from the classic orange peel and coriander spice formulation (although these are in there too, in spades ... Apparently they use no unmalted wheat along with lemon and lime peel). Tried on tap at a Calgary pub, certainly looks like a decent witbier, a cloudy orange-yellow with a dollop of white foam. As is often the case with North American mass-produced wits, has a huge coriander nose, a sour spicy tang along with a little raw dough. Quite crisp and dry, heavily carbonated and the coriander is too forward. One thing I will say is that there's a decent amount of citrus pith that DOES provide a counterbalance of sorts to all of that seed spice, some orange-lemon-lime (a bit like Mountain Dew soda pop) to prevent this from tasting purely like a coriander soup. You have to pay close attention though, as this brew is relatively devoid of any character from Belgian yeast or malt and leaves a relatively muted, watery impression. Alternatively, slam it back on a hot day and appreciate it for what it is.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 15, 2013"

Above average carbonation. Some spotty lacing was seen. The aroma is of some grains with some citrus and spice.

Aromas of toasted grain, a dash of citrus sweet, and not much else. You really have to go crashing in there with your nose to find anything. Flavors of roasted grain, citrus highlights, and a touch of clove spicing, all on a bready backbone. Flavors are subtle, and slightly weak compared to the smooth, mid-body feel in mouth. The carbonation leads to a quick, filmy, slightly sharp finish after a muddled, semisweet aftertaste. Not good.","GarthDanielson","Mar 31, 2013"

Taste: Pale malts swing towards a slightly tangy malted wheat with a mild, subtle sweetness. Medium carbonation. Dry finish. Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium, though airy carbonation.

It pours just fine but the lack of pleasant aromas and the sweetness make this not very drinkable. I would rather have either a soda or a beer, but not a sodabeer.","TSJ4000","Mar 12, 2012"

2.86,-2.7,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall, the Shock Top Belgian White is a ""utility"" beer, suitable for fast and inattentive drinking. There is not much complexity to the beer that makes it worth savouring. The taste, mouthfeel and aroma reminds us that it is brewed and bottled in New York, not Munich or Frankfurt. On the pour, it leaves a very thin head that dissipates quickly, with thin, spotty lacing that also absent after a few minutes. The taste provides a hint of orange and lime, with slight maltiness. The smell is a bit metallic, as is the taste, and there is also an aroma of malt that is not followed up on the palate. The texture/mouth feel is thin and slightly syrupy. The beer sports an even, golden cloudiness and a fluid spray of mild carbonation. Overall, there is nothing outstanding about the beer or notable in a positive or negative sense. It is definitely less passionate and of lower caste than German weissbier. However, when considered against its true comparators - domestic beer, it holds its own as a tasty thirst-quencher. I wrote this review as I drank the beer, poured from a can into a beer mug. Can was previously chilled around 40 degrees celcius. Thanks for reading!","Heffeweizenlover","Mar 02, 2012"

Smell was a little fruity but mostly malty and rich. It just tasted plain and empty. There was some good bitterness and the wheat taste was obvious but it wasn't rich or all that impressive. This is, I guess, supposed to be served with an orange wedge, which I didn't have. I can see how that would have helped, but in my opinion beer shouldn't need outside help.

It is infinitely better than a Blue Moon to me although the look is identical just as is the mouth feel. The difference is that A Blue Moon seemed to make me feel like I was drinking beer and giving me the feeling of a full stomach. Shock Top did not give me that full feeling even after a 6 pack.

The taste of the beer is mostly comprised of a soft wheat, sweet malt, clove and orange. There is only a faint trace of hops at the finish. Shock top is light in body, its drinkability is high but its not much more then a lawn mower beer.

This beer is almost absolute drainpour material, the only that that was somewhat promising was the look of it, it does look like a wit beer and goes completely downhill from there. The smells and the tastes are very muted and although getting both a citrusy fruit smell and taste it never really translated to anything orange to me.

It looked like your typical Belgian white, not as cloudy as some of the better ones (Allagash etc.) but it just tasted a little off. Again I've never had this beer before and probably won't again. It had a stale taste to it that wasn't very pleasing. I soldiered on and finished the beer since I had already paid some outrageous price for a 3/4 glass of beer.

The taste is somewhat weak, too. The coriander gives it a ruddy flavor on top of the macro twang, and this barely lets the fruit peels have any say. I'd much rather go without the lemon and lime and just dump more orange into it, but then it would be called Blue Moon. This is pretty bland.

It certainly looks good, it has the orangy yellow haze, white foamy head, lacing, and retention. The aroma is slight and it has the floral characteristics of the style, albeit toned down. The taste is similar in that you'll get the orange rind, coriander, floral citrus, perhaps a touch of pineapple. You won't get much clove, spice or anything else that would make this memorable.

A real wit has more delicate spices with vanilla and mellow wheat. The body here is also surprisingly heavy, with a sort of medium strength. And the mouthfeel is a bit chaulky.

That said, I know that this is an A-B effort and not aimed at the BA, but our friends and neighbors.

The smell is faint, but not what you'd call delicate. Takes some deep breaths to really get it. Smells like someone's making a good wheat beer about a block away. Non-descript citrus comes through in the taste, with a hint of wheat. That's right, a hint of the main ingredient. I like this style to have a bite and crispness like that first can of Pepsi at 6 am, but this lacks even the bite of the Dr. Pepper left over from lunch at 3:30 pm. They didn't use rice to calm it down, did they? If so, it's a shame.

Pours to a cloudy bright yellow with an actual fizz on the head. Looks like a wheat and tastes like a wheat. The carbonation is way too high (evident by the fizziness) but with that aside the flavor is not bad. It is difficult to get all the flavors through the high carbonation, but there is a wheat malt start and a nice spicy hop middle with a sweet malt finish. This is probably a good starter beer for the macro crowd to get into the craft beer scene. I'm tempted to let a bottle get a little flatter in the frig to check the real flavor. Good effort, for the crowd, should please.","mooseisloose","Feb 13, 2008"
3.53,20.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"It poured bright orange/yellowish with little head. Smelled citrusy sweet as I expected. The taste was not bad, a bit of an orange flavor even without the orange slice (I always opt out of it, it just gets in the way IMO). The beer didn't amaze me or anything, but I will most likely order it again sometime. However, I won't be rushin out to the store to buy up a sixer. One at a time is enough.","McDiddyPop","Feb 13, 2008"
3.67,24.8,3,3.5,4,2.5,4,"Being a fan of Blue Moon as a summer session beer I bought a 6 pack at my local Kroger. Orange/yellow with a small white head. It smells sweet and tastes pretty good. The spices are little different than Blue Moon. It feels a little watery when drinking but finishes very smooth. I will consider this as a session beer. Not something I will go out of my way to buy but would definetly consider a few while grilling some food.","Brew33","Feb 12, 2008"
3.01,2.4,4,3,3,2.5,3,"I saw this at my hotel bar. The bar tender knew nothing about it, but I thought I would give it a try anyway. This is really not a bad beer by AB. Nothing over the top, but every bit as good as Blue Moon.","champ103","Feb 09, 2008"
3.67,24.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"D - Quite drinkable - good American Wit. I would have another, but would not go out of my way for one, nor buy an entire six pack.","AChamberlain","Feb 08, 2008"
3.45,17.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: A sweet citrusy and refreshing summer time drink and a decent attempt by A-B. a touch to sweet to drink in multiples but much better then coor's blue moon in my opinion.","beerthulhu","Feb 04, 2008"
3.45,17.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a very cloudy yellow color with decent white head that lasted for a while. Flavor is citrusy and the flavor is as well. Pretty smooth drinking beer that is decent for an Anheuser-Busch product. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is pretty high. Not the best example of a Belgian witbier but not bad.","biggmike","Feb 02, 2008"

2.58,-12.2,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,"I tried this beer at a Gasparilla party yesterday, it was the first of what would be many beers throughout the day. I was skeptical since it is a Busch product but I was a bit taken by the funky label. It features an orange slice with sunglasses and a wheat mohawk. It's silly but amusing. Anyways my first impression of this beer was that is wasn't too bad. It has a very strong orange flavor, and a wheat-y bread taste underneath. The mouthfeel is very thin but my friends and I thought it was fairly refreshing. We didn't care for it as much as Blue Moon but it seemed to be a decent attempt by Busch. However, after two of these we all felt a little nauseous and switched over to Wittekerke. So the verdict is that the taste isn't terrible but too sickeningly orange to be drinkable.","jenbys2001","Jan 27, 2008"
3.16,7.5,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Similar to that of Blue Moon, but with a better combination of spices, but with the same malt problems as their Rocky Mountain competetor. This beer opens with a pleasant orange / copper looking hue and solid protein haze from the wheat. Although the wheat malt proves soft and bready, the pilner malt character was very timid. Where you expect to find a rich, bready, dough maltiness, this beer gives as astringent grainy texture and taste. A little more acidic than expected with less phenols and esters; subsituted with a spiciness that, although is pleasant, falls a little flat and less complex than prefered. This will be a nice summertime refresher, but the true beer enthusiest will go for a Hoegaarden or Blanch de Chambly.","BEERchitect","Jan 26, 2008"
3.22,9.5,3,3.5,3.5,2,3,"All things considered, this is by far the best brew A-B has ever put out. Celebrate from the Michelob line was close. It's a good beer in a style that would fit one of A-B's usual drinkers that might want to branch out a little bit from the more familiar lager & light lager styles.","PorterLambic","Jan 26, 2008"
3.9,32.7,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a hazy, pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a refreshingly light pale and wheat malt scent along with just a touch of orange peel and coriander. The taste is decent. It has an easy drinking witbier taste that incredibly smooth. It light and conservative. There is a nice citrus element to it. The spices are hard to detect. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable wit. Not too shabby for an AB interpretation.","WesWes","Jan 24, 2008"
3.1,5.4,3,3,3,3,3.5,"supposedly the year round offering alter ego of the ""spring heat spiced wheat"" spring seasonal from A-B. i'll have to check my reviews of that to see if my scores match up.","budgood1","Jan 18, 2008"

3.35,13.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a creamy white head that possesses pretty good retention and lacing qualities. The aroma is wheat and citrus with some spices and yeast. The taste is wheat with some spices and yeast but is watered down a bit which is a letdown after the promising smell. Overall, this is a decent witbier that is about middle of the pack. I will take this over a Blue Moon any day, so A-B did complete what they were trying to accomplish in that respect.","cjgator3","Jan 17, 2008"

But if faced between this and blue moon, i think i would choose this as it seems after changing the name, and i guess making it a year rounder, this one will try to compete against blue moon. I'm on the edge of me seat to see what happens between the two (que sarcasm). But not bad.","acrawf6","Jan 15, 2008"

Copped this singly from Total Wine and More in West Orange -first time I have ever seen this brew... ""Born-on-date"" on bottleneck reads Oct.27,2007... Was very disappointed by this macro-rendition of a water-down, pale, weak witbier... beer pours cloudy orange / yellow with no head... smell was very bland for this style, with none of the obvious orange, citrus or coriander coming through... taste was also sub-par, not much flavor going on here... weak in comparison to many other examples of the same genre... mouthfeel was decent, although a little watery and bland, and although this was easily drinkable, it definitely wouldn't be my one and only for the nite... Much better examples out there... not recommended...","dsa7783","Jan 11, 2008"

Poured a hazy golden yellow with a nice head which would probably been bigger if it had been poured into a weizen glass instead of the 9 oz sampler. Smelled of orange and corriander. Taste was citrusy with spicy, peppery notes. Mouthfeel was good. I liked this better than Blue Moon because the spices really came through (probably because it was so fresh).","clemtig76","Dec 16, 2007"
3.5,19,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Noticed this on tap at some random TexMex place when I visited Houston last week. Could tell it was a AB product by the type of tap handle - those cartoonish ""what is that brewery?"" type that becomes more obvious when all the other taps are domestics. It's not Hoegaarden, but can but up a fight for a refreshing, quenching, Belgian wit. A bit on the yellow side, lots of carbonation, some spices and citrus character. Not bad.","Backer2004","Dec 10, 2007"
3.47,18,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I tried this on the AB brewery tour this past Sunday. Reminds me a lot of Blue Moon in flavor but the color is a little lighter. Pours a nice hazy yellow with a one finger head. This was in a 9 oz. taster so, the head could have been bigger if poured in to a pilsner or weizen glass. Smelled of orange and corriander. Taste was citrus with spicy notes. Mouthfeel was good. Has a smooth drinkability. Not better than Blue Moon, but good.","bluesfan1181","Dec 04, 2007"
3.12,6.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,"D - Decent. I remember trying the spiced wheat on tap and having the same reaction. It's not bad at all, but not really my thing. Might be interesting to do a taste off with Blue Moon. If you're caught between this and Bud, take this, otherwise, it's simply take it or leave it.","PhageLab","Dec 04, 2007"
