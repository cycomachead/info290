3.46,9.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pomegranate, pear, apple, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with decent balance of pale malt, fruit, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. A bit too estery in the nose. Taste of lemon, pomegranate, pear, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity tartness and earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pomegranate, pear, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt, fruit, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a solid fruited wheat ale. Good robusntess and balance of pale malt, fruit, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

3.37,6.3,3.25,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from bottle, a bright clear gold beer, some initial head but it fades quickly leaves little lacing. Smell is vaguely grapefruity, pomegranate, floral, raspberry. Light but with some artificial aspects to it and a pungent fruity character. Taste is light, pomegranate is foremost, syrupy almost, raspberry, a bit sweet but not too muc actually. The wheat base is mild and it is an easy drinking refresher. Light bodied with a mild carbonation, detectable wheat creaminess to it. I'm not crazy about this but don't hate it either, the pomegranate does come across strongly and feel a bit forced and artificial but as a complete package the beer is alright, dry citrus finish, not a ton of traditional flavours but hey this is meant to be pretty off the wall. Not something I'd drink everyday but could be different one to try. Light and mild, smell isn't great but the beer itself could be worse. Some lemon and pomegranate, maybe would make a good salad dressing?","mick303","Mar 15, 2014"

Not much to speak about with smell. Taste was also disappointing. Overall not a real strong beer, decent but nothing special. Probably will not buy again. Of course, may be overly rough because I drank it right after a Weihenstephaner Heffeweisbier, so tough act to follow.","JamieDuncan","Mar 12, 2014"

1.84,-42,2,1.75,2,1.5,1.75,"Served in a shaker at The Saucer on 4/7/13. Pours an almost flat golden-yellow favoring the flesh of a mango. There was a little haze to it, but it seemed more like something dirty floating in it than really a wit or hefe type unfiltered haze. There was no head to this beer. I watched the pour and it was done by one of the bartenders that knows how to pour a beer. He didn't not pour off the head. He poured it at about 75 degrees and it just formed nothing. The smell was just flat as well. There was tons of bubbles in the glass, so I didn't think it was a carbonation thing. There was maybe a whisper of fruit syrup and some maybe banana on top of some cheap white bread. The taste was just a bunch of nothing overall. I feared a flat beer given the head and the nose situation, but it was really quite fizzy; too fizzy really. There was something that maybe wanted to be pomegranate, but only came off as flavoring syrup. There was no wheat flavor at all and there was this harsh hops flavor to it as well; no flavoring hops, just a flat bitterness. Overall, this beer was just off. Sytlistically it just doesn't work right for either a wit or a true wheat beer. It really was like drinking a budweiser with some fruit flavor to it. I may give it another shot just to be sure, but I just didn't like it.","estlinska","Apr 07, 2013"

Pours out to a lightly hazy peach. forming a small white head with poor retention and absent lacing. Carbonation is moderate ~2.5 carbs. The aroma is of grain husk and kiwi fruit. Mouthfeel is moderately tart with a light body. The taste is just grain husk, kiwi fruit, a weird moderate metallic bitterness and more sourness. Not a lactobacillus infected sourness, but a citric sourness. The bitterness certainly seems toned down compared to my prior review, but it's still pretty brisk considering the style and body.","Mitchster","Jan 24, 2013"

The aroma was of citrusy hops, tart fruit, pale malt and wheat. The flavors were very tart with notes of pomegranate, berries, citrusy hops and a twang of wheat. It tasted off to me, however, too tart and misbalanced. I wonder if it was not stored properly or just didn’t age well. I feel it should be better than the example I had. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, the body medium/light and the carbonation average.","thekevlarkid","Nov 04, 2011"

Reminds me of a fruit juice. The taste definitely displays some pomegranate, I think, but has a wheat backbone on the swallow. Tangy (almost harsh) finish with some rind-like characteristics.

Looks more like a macro lager than a micro Witbier. The nose is surprisingly hop dominant with a mild, slightly toasted malt backdrop and only a faint whiff of fruitiness which I will attribute to the pomegranate. It is not much more apparent in the taste other than in the presence of a tart acidic flavor but the fact that it is pomegranate is indistinguishable. There is a definite wheaty-ness to it as well as a lightly toasted malt flavor - victory maybe? The beer is also well balanced with hops and finishes neutral with the tart acidity I previously mentioned. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin yet smooth and creamy carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer and not bad. My only let down with this beer is the advertisement of pomegranate which as I mentioned is indistinguishable.

Aromatics are not what I was expecting, fruit beers usually equate to sticky sweet messes in the smell. This smells like an actual beer, even has some hop aroma to it, nice. Pale cereal grains provided biscuit malt sweetness with a grassy background of hops and a mildly tart fruit pomegranate character going on. Flavor has the tart earthy sweet pomegranate extract twang but again it's all built upon a solid brewed beer, sharp wheat sweetness nothing too fizzy or cloying. Moderate balanced flow to it all it's sweet slightly tart with hop bitterness in the background finishing off the beer, a really even experience. Mouthfeel is not cloying or sticky with residual sugars, crisp sturdy carbonation but a very natural feel to it light to medium bodied overall, this is quality fruit beer.

The taste was wheat and hops (surprisingly, the latter came out stronger), and some complimentary tart fruit along for the ride, which obviously included pomegranate, but also might have had some citrus in there. The hops and the dry, carbonated mouthfeel gave the beer a bit of a crips bite. I enjoyed the taste at first sip, but as I drank more, I liked it less.

At least this one has some decent wheat character to it. And it seems like the warmer it gets, the more even it becomes. I am actually sitting here thinking that I might give a 4 on flavor, so I will. That surprises me as most of these pomegranate wheats just end up being totally weak. This one at least has some positive attributes. Feel is a bit of a tingle on the tongue from carbonation and who knows what else. Liquid is kind of doughy.

S: Pomegranate really coming through with the wheat, some malt in there with just a touch of soapiness, minimal hops. T: The wheat hits you first followed very loudly by the pomegranate, a fruity-bitter finish, the hops dont really seem to jive with the overall character very well. Very citric. M: Moderate to high carbonation, fairly thin otherwise. D: It could be that I just dont like pomegranate, but I didnt really take to this very much. Its definitely interesting and the slight wheat flavor works nicely with the tartness, but the pomegranate is so overwhelming it was hard to fully enjoy. Definitely worth a try, if only for the novelty.","PlaywrightSam","Apr 20, 2007"

The pomegranate was very present along with some other fruits such as banana. The pomegranate dominated the palate and added an excellent touch to the style. The beer was light bodied and decently carbonated. I'm not the biggest fan of witbiers, but the addition of pomegranate makes this one stand out.","atsprings","Feb 23, 2007"

2.8,-11.7,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clean yellow straw color with a white, moderately dense head. Not a lot of staying power. Sporadic lacing. Nose is not of wheat, but I do detect some fruity character here ... could be the pomegranate, I recon. Hops seem to be prominent too. Palate is interesting, to say the least. This is a wheat beer? I don't taste the wheat, and for that matter, I don't taste anything that I'd classify as a pomegranate flavor either. This is one of the strangest brews I've tried. Tastes more like a medium-bodied lager, or maybe a Kolsch, than it does a wheat ale. There is an off flavor here too, which I can't identify. Slightly sweet, with a medium/light mouthfeel. Rather high carbonation, and a slightly bitter finish. Lacks substance. I have to confess I was way underwhelmed with this beer. I managed to finish 2/3 of it and poured the rest. A Witbier classification? I don't think so. Despite this brew, I'm anxious to try some of the other offerings from Fort Collins Brewery.","beerphilosopher","Jun 24, 2006"

Taste is tart grapes, green apples and cherries, with wheat and corriander. As my compadre battlekow told me, kind of tastes like a carbonated sports drink with some mouth-puckering tartness. Mouthfeel is crisp and drinkable, I can see myself downing a few but after a while I think my mouth would be tired with more than that. A decent balance of sweet, spicy and tart here. Really not as fruity as you would think. This is a unique brew worth trying if you can find it.","Golden2wenty1","Oct 02, 2005"

I don't detect any fruitiness in the nose; however, there is some in the flavor, which I assume is pomegranate (I've never tasted the fruit itself). It's sweet but tart, and balanced perfectly with the beer's chewy wheatiness. Major Tom's tastes really fucking good--I think I've found my new favorite lawnmower beer.
