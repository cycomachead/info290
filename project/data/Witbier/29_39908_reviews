"Not as bad as anticipated, just a rather benign wheat beer."
""
""
"A tasty refreshing Belgian white  beer."
""
""
"Before real craft beers opened my eyes this was my original ""craft beer"""
""
""
"Smells like orange/citrus and grassy.  It is kind of heavy tasting with citrus accents."
"Not my favorite, had an almost sour aftertaste."
"I'm generally not much of a fan of the taste of unfiltered beers I've had, with this not being an exception"
""
"Not sure what the problem is with this beer. Yeah, I know it's brewed by Anheuser-Busch but not everything they do is immediately terrible. Had this at Buffalo Wild Wings and I gotta say, this beer goes perfect with spicy food. It doesn't have any really strong flavors, and it's not bitter at all. Slightly sweet and very carbonated. It goes down almost like water. It'd be great for mowing the lawn or going out on a boat, or maybe for cookouts. I like this quite a bit."

""
""
"Absolutely nothing special going on here"

"Awful overall.  The taste makes me want to vomit.  It is most definitely two notches under most wheat beers on the market.  It features a complicated, medicinal, chemical blend of citrus flavors.  Poor look too, loses its head of foam quickly and looks flat thereafter.  This beer is poor at best."
""
""
"Nice color. Poor everything else. This beer wants to be Bell's Oberon and others like it but falls on its face like most Macrobrews."
""
"A good citrus flavored beer."
"essentially the same beer as Blue Moon Belgian White. Only difference is that this beer makes me sick. Idk what it is what Anheuser-Busch products but there is something they use that makes my stomach sick"
""
""
"A little darker and more cloudy than a regular Bud - so they made an attempt"
""
""
""
""
"Tasty alternative to Blue Moon. Gotta 4 pack of pint cans for 6 bucks, works for me."
"seriously an even worst rip off of blue moon"
""
""
"Slight orange flavor. Full body that can fill you up. Not at all watery. Great white ale and affordable too."
""
"beer is Great smooth had one earlier today with burrito EXCELLENT SHOCK TOP Belgium White @irnva"
""
""
""
"Nice beer, crisp and clean, not a whole lot of flavor, good for a hot day or to drink with spicy food, better with lemon, lime, orange wedge added to it. would buy again"
"They just started carrying this at the local Olive Garden.  It is tasty and I like the way it looks ...cloudy with character.   It's very smooth beer with a nice but minimal citrus taste.. if you like a smooth beer with some character, this is pretty good stuff. If you think your beer needs to taste like a hops covered shoe dipped in alcohol and with dirt added for color, this isn't going to cut it.."
"Decent Belgian white. don't love it, don't hate it..."
"Overall- Not a bad beer, middle of the road."
"Decent and completely drinkable. I kinda like it."
""
""
"Great wheat beer.  More suited to casual drinking with friends in the alley than with a meal."
"A buy from time to time"
""
""
""
"Shows a little cloudy but a nice smooth beer"
"The description provided says it all. The citrus flavors aren't overwhelming.  Light feel to it. Would be bothered to have it again."
""
"Horrible ! if you haven't found craft beer yet then drink a blue moon over this"
""
"."
""
"The best of what was available at a concert."
""
""
"Cheers"
""
""
""
""
"Just a big cup of ""meh"". It's not bad, I wouldn't call it swill, but it's certainly not special or notable in any way."
""
"Serving Type: Bottle"
""
""
"Very....very generic. A little too generic"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this with and without an orange. With the orange, I primarily tasted the orange and very little of the beer itself. It was more like a soda than a beer. Without the orange, and overall, I found the beer less than average. I could taste the citrus and coriander, which gave it an earthy tone, but, unfortunately, it just wasn't all that great."
"Love me some shock top"
"Surprise to the tastebuds.  Great all season drink"
""
"This is a decent beer for the price but it lacks something I expect in a Belgian White.  I think it's lack of yeast flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - You could easily drink 3-4 of these , can be refreshing if you didn't mind the lack of beer taste; it tastes mass produced, if that makes sense"
""
"this is so much better than some of the other beers in this category light clean tasty!"
""
"Good taste. Better with an orange"
""
""
""
""
"O: About the same as Blue Moon, but it seems to be more of a mix between a witbier and an adjunct lager. A little crisper, though. Buy whichever is cheapest."
"Not good, avoid at all costs."
"I don't get the vitriol for this beer; it isn't a bad beer by any means, it's just not a great beer. Is it a legitimate Belgian beer? Of course not, but Budweiser isn't really a legitimate lager, so I'll judge it on its taste alone: pretty good, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This beer is certainly below par, but what was I really expecting anyway?  I got it just because, and I regretted it from start to finish.  I would never order this again.  Period."

"There are MUCH better options out there."
"Well. My options tonight were the ubiquitous American Light Pale Lagers... and this. It was inoffensive and satisfying for the place I was at. It's Anheiser-Busch's ""craft"" line, and honestly feels like they tasted Blue Moon and went ""oh, yeah? Well, HERE."""

"Really not much to this one. Some grainy and citrus elements, particularly orange. Light and simple. Beyond that, little depth, flavor and complexity. I simply wanted to at least try this one. Now that I've done that, I have decided that once is quite enough."

"Pours with a small, white head. Is golden in color and very murky. Has aromas of citrus from brewed peels and wheat that combine to create and alright smell. Initial taste is strong with coriander, but not too strong. Orange and like combine to create a finishing flavor. Overall taste is alright. A right in the middle beer."
""

"This beer nearly made me quit drinking beer for ever. Had it in a can no less. Steer clear."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A fairly drinkable beer which is relatively free of the astringent corn flavour that is present in most of their other beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I usually like IPA's and I was kinda disappointed to find out this was made by ""them"". But I have to say that this has a consistent drinkability and enough flavor to make it above average."
"The first time I had it I liked it. Then the next case flavor seemed to become dull and non appeeling to me."
""
""
""
""

"I haven't liked any of the Shock Top brand beers. Taste like skunky beer."

"I wonder, however, why it has such poor ratings on BA. It's a bit dark for the style, I'll say that. And perhaps the head retention and lacing could be a little better, but I still think it's pretty good for the style. It's a bit malty, mainly wheaty in the aroma, but there's still some coriander to it, as well as orange peel, and all of that carries into the flavor as well. It's rounded and balanced. It might be fuller than I'd expect, but there are other American breweries doing the same. Blue Moon is much heavier, and scores better, and there are a lot of brewpubs and smaller micros in the same boat. Besides all of that, it's clean and consistent. I think it's just getting a bad rap here because it's made by A-B."

"Bland beer, basically water with a bit of beer mixed in."
""
"I'm a big fan of Belgian style wheat beers, but this one is just ho-hum. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not remarkable.  Taste is grainy with a slight spice/bitterness to it on the backend. Very watery and lightly carbonated. Serviceable as a witbier but not one of the better ones."
""
""
"So would I recommend it ? Sure, it's refreshing and doesn't have a bad taste at all BUT if you are looking for a Belgium style, there is much better. If you are looking for a smelly beer, this one is not for you. If you are looking for a beer that have some guts, this one is not for you either."

"Overall  : If you drink a Shock Top Belgian and think you've tried a Wit, you've been mislead. This is the second beer I feel like pouring today. It's a sad example of a great style. Try Hoegaarden or Blue Moon for a much better example of how Witbier should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The spices and and peel tastes are not very evident in this beer, but overall a good, drinkable white."

""
""
""
""
"A standard you see a lot of places and it really hits the ""okay"" rating pretty spot on. Not great, but not terrible either. Appearance is a hazy light yellow with a fizzy head. The smell was a lot of orange peel and other citrus. The taste was similar with a lot of orange and then a little bit of wheat and yeast underneath. Mouthfeel was pleasant. Overall, a beer I wont say no to, but probably wont be picking up a case anytime soon."
""
""
""
"I'm surprised at the low rating. I always thought this was a good beer. Certainly no Paulaner but it's a decent wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The smell and taste of this beer remind me of tomato soup.  I like tomato soup, but it is not what I'm looking for in my beer."

"Poor imitation of a belgian white. Watery imitation of Blue Moon even when the Blue moon white is a poor beer. I have a fondness for Bluemoon as it was my notice of the idea of Craft Beer and the existence other beers other than adjunct lagers."

"I've found that drinking ST from the bottle and following the directions on the bottle on how to pour into a glass makes a big difference. Especially if you add a slice of orange to the glass. Still a fairly weak macrobrew, but better than your typical Bud or Miller swill."
"I've had MUCH worse beers than this - some so bad that I had to pour them down the drain. This beer is disappointing as a ""white ale," but definitely NOT drain pour. I wouldn't spend money on it, but it it's hot or very warm out and it's offered to me, I will gladly take it simply as a thirst quencher."
"Shock Top taste great UNLESS you do not read the bottle. With this beer it is important that you pour the beer into a mug except for about an inch of beer in the bottle. At this point you need to swish around the beer in the bottom of the bottle to get the sediment out and dump into your glass. You will have a much better tasting beer. I also recommend squeezing a slice of orange into the beer for a more citrus flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I personally like blue moon better than this, but shock top has more of a sort of water down Orange juice flavor to it and was good for the hotter days. Less citrus out of the bottle than poured into a glass. It's like a lighter option to blue moon."
""

""

""
""

"O - Not only not distinctive, but actually a poor example of style in a lot of ways. Where is the wheat? Where's the yeast character? Or even the citrus for that matter?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Not a bad entry level wheat. Lacking of any major characteristics but not a bad go to for if you can't find a wheat with more character."

"Overall: Not too interesting but nothing offensive. Certainly a step up from the standard lagers you find at social events. Cheap, easy to find, and good on a hot day. This is one of the few beers that I can share with my friends who don't like intense beers."

"This beer was a pretty good beer. I liked it a lot, I like to put a orange wedge in it. The citrus flavor that it has is really good. The citrus flavor that it has made the beer taste even better I think. The smell of this beer was also pretty good as well."

"O: A very mediocre witbier which is pretty much what you'd expect from AB. Decently drinkable, but could get a little cloying after a few"

"Best served poured into a glass with a slice of orange, the fresh citrus compliments the beer. Without the orange, though, pouring yields a mild head, with notes of citrus and coriander. Slightly cloudy in color. More sweet and refreshing than anything else, can't really even tell there's hops in it. Good for barbecues and summer get togethers."
""
"Shock top is well worth trying"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shock Top Belgian White is something I could definitely drink on a regular basis. Definitely richer and deeper than the bland offerings by the same brewer."
""
""
""
"o - Overall not a terrible beer; not great and pretty average, but not offensive at all. Light oranges and citrus in the nose, with less in the taste. Nothing to seek out but not the worst you can do."
" but at this price point and for the style C+."
""
""
""
"So far off from the style.  Not even close.  Fresca fermented with Belgian yeast isn't a wit beer.  Sorry AB."

"Overall this beer is ok. The pub that I'm at only has 5 choices on tap so the pickings are slim. I may have it again but only if it comes between this and a macro American lager."
""
""
""
""
"not as bad as the ratings would have you beleive, it isnt typical for either styles its mixing together, something similar to like beachchair, but once again slightly more boring, I can see necking back a half dozen in the sun on the beach or something, and it would pair nicely with light food like fish and chips, but over all i must admit to slight dissapointment, not as punchy as I had hoped for. although now that I understand what it brings to the table, I may find a place for it."
""
""
""
"Pours a somewhat clear off orange color. Good carbonation and head. The smell is the least favorable thing about this beer, I really can't detect any scents. Tastes better than it smells, I like the mouthfeel. It's a little better than I expected, not a bad beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The original ""craft"" brew for me."
"This is a great summer beer. Pour a fine orange and golden color. Somewhat cloudy, but it has a fine aroma of oranges and wheat. It's flavor is strong citrus note but very easy to drink. The tart initial flavor of orange and lemon is followed by a light wheat aftertaste."

"Had this at a Premium Outlet bar in the Pocono's while the wife shopped. Bar- the log cabin bar and grill- only had 5 beers on tap, so we know why I chose this.  Pint glass... Light orange look, less than a finger head, no lacing... Smelled completely of orange and tasted similar. Lots of carbonation made for a light taste... Might be good on a hot day in the sun, but otherwise another rank and file masquerading as a craft."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice light citrus flavor with a nice citrus aroma. Goes down easy, but is a bit too sweet if you drink a few in a row. After three or four it starts to leave an unpleasant syrupy aftertaste. Overall I really like it, but no more than a few at a time."

"Had this from a tall can today at a golf scramble. And you know what? Not bad at all. I went straight from the can but have seen it before. Usually a slightly cloudy yellow with a. Frothy head. Smells like a little bit of a dirty wheaty thing, some light spice and yeast, and a little sweetness on the nose.Taste is a bit of sweet yeast funk, coriander, some orange like flavor (maybe they just add this now in the can?), light sweet malts. Light bodied and pretty refreshing with medium plus carbonation. For realz a solid golf brew. Would drink again."
""
""
"Poor imitation of Blue Moon, which is in itself a below average clone of ... something. No head, no lacing. Beer smelled, looked, and tasted flat. Poor finish with a poor aftertaste. BDubs had it as a craft/specialty brew, but it's just a crummy macro on steroids."

"I am usually a big fan of Belgian's but this was almost like drinking perfume. It tastes like what my grandmother smelled like- no offense grandma. I would have possibly enjoyed it more if it had a stronger wheat taste, more like Blue Moon or countless others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - While this is something i would purchase at a bar with limited selection, it just seems thin and flat for the style. Passable and even good for mass-produced fare, but overall pretty mediocre."
"Poured into a weizen glass. This is so ubiquitous I've wanted to try it for a while. Pours a hazy, light golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, light citrus and a hint of Belgian yeast. Flavor is washed out orange, mild wheat and hints of coriander. Finishes with an odd light coriander, mild citrus with a hint of hops. Light bodied. Well, the looks and aroma gave me hope and I was prepared to be pleasantly surprised, but this was as expected a washed out version of the witbier style. The flavors are there, but associated with citrus that tastes like watered down orange juice or one of those old, dried oranges that have lost their bright taste. The flavor is so attenuated that the coriander tastes out of place in the finish. I would not buy this again and don't see the point of brewing it. The nice interplay of wheat and spices from witbier are missing here. Like most AB products, harmless enough to finish, but no reason to repeat."

"Shock Top Belgian White brew by Anheuser-Busch. I don't like the appearance of this brew- too cloudy. This brew is not filtered. But I beleive that is how all wheat brews are. The brew pours out a cloudy amber color. Taste is good ; you can taste the wheat and the orange. Overall, I like this brew. The taste is where it's at, bold flavor and smooth going down."

"I had this beer on tap in a bar in Arizona.. So keep in mind it was hotter than hell outside.. plus I hadn't ate much... But for a hot day when your hungry, this beer is amazing... I don't like Wheat Beers very much but this was pretty good... The fruit flavor throws off the crappy wheat flavors lol.. Plus it will fill you up, which can be good or bad depending on what your wanting... I will say Blue Moon is better brew of the same style... But on a hot day when you've been working hard this beer is hard to beat..."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I remember trying this when I first got into craft a few years ago and liking it. So, seeing it in a 16 oz. can intrigued me. While there is nothing offensive here there is nothing to bring you rushing back other than the convenient packaging."
""

""

"I reviewed Chock Top by itself a little while back, and thought it one of the best chocolate beers I had sampled- I just think it works with this style, and could be emulated. The addition of the Shock Top in a black and tan brings about some flavors reminiscent of one of those orange chocolate candies. Shock Top alone is nothing special, with some lemony-orange, and grassy tones, and easy drinking, but nothing too distinctive. The two combined are really quite nice, since the chocolate flavor is tough to subdue, and the Shock Top quiets it down a bit while adding some citrus notes. The number ratings are for the Shock Top alone, however. If I could rate them together, I would probably add a quarter or half point in each category."
""
""
""
""
""
"Shock top belgian white is absolutely delicious . Everything down from the taste to the packaging. Its citrus like taste adds points. The orange slice with the sunglasses is pretty cool too. It makes you feel good when you drink this beer. I give a good score to it. I will most certainly be getting this beer in the future"
""
"O - Different but I won't be dumping the remaining three cans but not sure if I will be buying more. I actually think this could be a good introduction to ""crafty"" beers for your BMC drinking friends."

"Pours a golden straw color with a thin white head. Smells of wheat, hops, and slight hints of citrus. The taste very citrusy with mild hints of hops and wheat. The mouth feel was pleasant with slight carbonation. I tried it both without the orange and with both are good however i found with the orange the beer became a little too citrusy for me. Overall it was a decent beer."

"This beer gets a mention in Stan Hieronymus' ""Brewing With Wheat"" as an example of what happens when a large brewery tries to market a traditional beer style to the general public (successfully, if sales are any indicator. Of course they aren't, at least where quality is concerned). The recipe is in fact rather interesting, deviating from the classic orange peel and coriander spice formulation (although these are in there too, in spades ... Apparently they use no unmalted wheat along with lemon and lime peel). Tried on tap at a Calgary pub, certainly looks like a decent witbier, a cloudy orange-yellow with a dollop of white foam. As is often the case with North American mass-produced wits, has a huge coriander nose, a sour spicy tang along with a little raw dough. Quite crisp and dry, heavily carbonated and the coriander is too forward. One thing I will say is that there's a decent amount of citrus pith that DOES provide a counterbalance of sorts to all of that seed spice, some orange-lemon-lime (a bit like Mountain Dew soda pop) to prevent this from tasting purely like a coriander soup. You have to pay close attention though, as this brew is relatively devoid of any character from Belgian yeast or malt and leaves a relatively muted, watery impression. Alternatively, slam it back on a hot day and appreciate it for what it is."

" I had this on tap many times before, especially back in Orlando and was served with a orange slice. From the Shock Top Brewing Company in St. Louis (the Bud folks), their ""SHOCK TOP ~ BELGIAN WHITE"" pours a hazy orange-yellow in color with a 2-finger fizzy white head that doesn't last long. Above average carbonation. Some spotty lacing was seen. The aroma is of some grains with some citrus and spice. The taste was the same and a little 'watered down' like most Bud brews BUT is still better than most of their brews."
""
""
""
""
"The beer was in a bottle, and was inviting because it was labeled ""Belgium Ale."" It was light on the tongue and milky -- SKIM milky -- on the palate. Had a metallic after-taste that barely buzzed me. Had no idea this was an Anheuser-Busch product, but after tasting it, I realized it was like having a Bud Light Platinum with slight creamy finish."

"To put it simply, this is basically Budweiser with some orange thrown in there. That's pretty much all that I got out of this, in all aspects. Not the best of this style by any means; there are FAR better Witbiers out there...FAR BETTER. But if you're just looking for an easily drinkable beer and you're on a budget, I'd have to say this is better than most of the piss beers out there."

"Pours a cloudy orangish yellow color with small head and little lacing. Not much aroma either but I do get a hint of citrus smell. Taste is very bland like a popular light beer not really what I expected. Do not taste the citrus really don't taste anything. No bitterness detected at all and very slight orange aftertaste. Overall it's drinkable but tasteless."

"I was impressed with the good gold color of the beer. These Belgian's don't always impress me with their hue but this one looks good. Unfortunately, little to no head, and no staying power - but it was a very bright white color - I'll give it that. I also liked the soothing wheat smell mixed in with hops - it was just right. The carbonation was just right, and the taste was exactly what I smelled, which is a big plus up for me. Overall, I was impressed - it was smooth and refreshing, while packing a decent punch."
""
""
""
"I'm not a fan of this beer. Smells like OJ, tastes like watered-down OJ. Unpleasant, lingering aftertaste. It pales in comparison to other similar brews including Blue Moon, which is average at best in my opinion. Surprised to see it was over 5% ABV. Would not buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although the real reason I bought it is because Ft Sam has it for $12.50 a case and I couldn't pass up a deal like that. Keep it cold and it's a great beer for a 105 degree day here in south Texas. I wouldn't pay much more than that for it, but when it's cheaper than Pabst . . ."

"O - A pretty poor attempt by Anheuser-Busch at creating a Belgian Wit macro brew. Although that being said it's really not that bad, it's very drinkable, it just doesn't really match the style well. I will give it to Anheuser-Busch though that this is better then the Canadian macro-brewed failed attempts at a Witbeer by Rickards and Alexander Keiths"

"O- This is worse than I remember it being, and I remember really not liking it. It essentially tastes like an orange extract, mimed coriander, and almost wheat flavored Budweiser, which is very marketable but not very good."
""
""
"O: In a bit of harsh honesty, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this and Anheuser-Busch didn't do a great job of changing my mind. While it's certainly not the worst beer I've had, it's definitely low on the list. It just comes off too... I don't know... Artificial tasting. I suppose this beer is acceptable if your only other choices are light beers, or if you're trying to open to door for someone to stray away from light beers; otherwise, it's best to leave this one on the shelf."

"O - Good beer for the neophyte branching out from macros. I can think of dozens of better values for my beer money."
""
""
""
"This, again is similar to my favorite beer, Blue Moon. I enjoy this beer and have had it both from bottles and on tap. It has a light, golden appearance with a citrus style flavor. Little head, but the head that is there is a creamy light head. This beer is also great with a orange in it."
""
""

"One of the worst beers I've ever sampled. Needless to say I will avoid at all costs."

"Great for a summer day. Not too high of an ABV combined with the sweetness, makes it a good beer when the suns out and you're playing beach volleyball or at a graduation party."
""

""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a nice white head with a gold tone and cloudy appearance. The beer had a nice wheat flavor with hints of caramel, coriander, orange and lemon. The flavor dissipates quickly; therefore, the beer is too light and lacks lasting flavor. It would be a good beer for the summer with its light, slight refreshing flavors."

"Poured bottle into weizen glass. hazey yellow orange color. White foam reduces fast. Nice citrus taste. Not overly carbonated. Mouth feel is smooth. There are instructions on puring on the side of the bottle. Give it a little swirl before emptying the whole bottle in the glass. Not to bad of a beer. Nice summer party beer, I would put some in the cooler for camping. Worth a try."
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse-vase, the beer is a cloudy, pale, yellow-orange coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout and no head on top. Aromas of toasted grain, a dash of citrus sweet, and not much else. You really have to go crashing in there with your nose to find anything. Flavors of roasted grain, citrus highlights, and a touch of clove spicing, all on a bready backbone. Flavors are subtle, and slightly weak compared to the smooth, mid-body feel in mouth. The carbonation leads to a quick, filmy, slightly sharp finish after a muddled, semisweet aftertaste. Not good."

"A great beer that has a good citrusy after taste. before you drink this be sure to swirl and carefuly tip upside down to mix properly to get all the flavors ..this is a beer for seahawks fans cause this is all we drink at century link feild..let's go hawks!!"

"O - A pretty good showing, makes you wonder why Anheuser-Busch made Golden Wheat when they already had this. I'd buy it if it's cheap, but not likely to happen when there's Oberon, Blue Moon, Sunset Wheat, and Hoegaarden around most of the time instead."

"Light effervescent body. Malt sweetness with a big tangerine flavor. Tastes like orange soda with unfermented malt extract added a the faintest whisp of wheat. Really a lot worse than I remember, haven't had it in a couple years, worse than blue moon and I don't like that either. Overly sweet and reminiscent of soda"

""
""

"This beer pours a hazy straw golden colour that disipates rather quickly. Smells off. Orange zest and ketchup. Why ketchup? Tastes like Campbell's tomato soup with crackers. Aftertase is nice, though, with an orange zesty flavour. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Overall, a beer I'll never be drinking again."

"i have no idea how this got popular. its a brutal representation of a style of beer that i adore. the pour from the tap into my pint glass is cloudy and artifically orange, with a ton of thick sediment suspended within and about an inch of white head that fades fast and looks real nasty when its gone. the nose is okay, some fruity yeast and a ton of orange zest. almost like an orange juice beer, from concentrate of course. the nose and the taste are both rather floral, which i cant explain. the yeast is fruity but generic, lacking the real light bright white feel and taste i expect in a wit. way too thick in body for the style too, even though this is relatively easy drinking. enough carbonation to cut through the heavy sediment, but no equilibrium is reached, and this remains an unbalanced glass of mass produced wash. i woulnt recommend this to anyone, and it kills me that this is the witbier that bars carry and that the average drinker thinks is some sorft of craft item. its moderately better in a bottle i reckon, but on tap this is offensive."

"Looks light with a haze and almost an artificial, fizzy top. The smell is orange mist and water--memories of Walter's sprayed produce come to mind. It's edible and creamy...compared to its rice-adjunct counterparts! Far from great, but equally as far from terrible. You can definitely wash down cheap American eats with this here Shocktop. There's not much feel to speak of, but maybe a bit of effervescence off the orangey, citrusy carbonation. At least it's not a fraud!"

"I have had this beer both on tap and bottled. In both cases it has been superior to many Belgian whites brewed by microbreweries. It is certainly not Hoegaarden, but it is half the price.

"This offering pours a cloudy straw with a huge four finger head. No lacing is observed. Smell is the strongest point with oranges, grass, bread, and maybe some cinnamon detected. Mouthfeel is about average. Taste is the low point. It is extremely sweet with no hoppiness on the finish to balance it out. I don't mind a good wheat beer, but this one I'll pass on should it come my way again."

If your other options are the usual selection of macro beers, then this would be another choice, but, even then, there is nothing special here.

"O: This is another crap beer from Anhieser Busch. They cheap out on the wheat and the hops and make a beer that is way too sweet without the presence of a Belgian yeast strain. Figures"

"This beer was basically your typical cheap quasi-craft offering from a large brewing corporation. I would drink it again if handed one. I even tried pouring all the sediment in which really made no difference at all. It's just a very plain Witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent summer wheat in a pinch if there is nothing better on tap at your local pub. Two finger white well retained head on a hazy yellow body, good retention and lace. Scent and taste is wheat and orange peel with some coriander. Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Definitely one of my top favorite. It's light, smooth, refreshing and not overbearing."
""
""
"Overall – Easy drinking and affordable. It has some nice characteristics and makes for a good session brew."
""
"Overall, this might be a good introduction into the world of witbiers but I would move on quickly. There are much better examples out there."
""
"Final Thoughts: This strikes me as a good benchmark for a generic tasting witbier. Nothing here is going to wow you, but it doesn't really do anything wrong. I enjoyed it, and would do so again if it was priced similar to a normal Macro offering."
""
"Drinkability: Very simple Witbier with a ton of orange peel. Refreshing on a hot day, but can certainly do better."

"Pours a pale golden color with a fizzy white head that dissipates very quickly. There is a hint of belgian spicy yeast on the nose but it is very muted. Like someone dropped a single clove in my glass, I can just barely smell it. I also get a stale sugar aroma, it reminds me of a 7-up that has been left on the counter all day. The taste is flaccid, I get a touch of coriander but more of that stale soda flavor that I got on the nose. The mouthfeel is extremely thin and soda like, I am sure it would be really drinkable on a hot day. Overall if someone offered it to me on a hot day I would drink it but I won't seek it out."
""
""
"O - A decent beer for a change-up, but nothing I'm rushing back to."
""
""
"O: its a beer that is trying to do something different, but just doesn't quite have it just yet, no yeast so its not a real witbier, would I have again, unsure - ???"

"Appearance: Lightly hazed, pale yellow body with a tall, somewhat lasting, white head. Smell: Rather scant hints at pale malts and malted wheat before some slightly bolder, but still very, very mild notes of clove and orange peel. Taste: Pale malts swing towards a slightly tangy malted wheat with a mild, subtle sweetness. Medium carbonation. Dry finish. Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium, though airy carbonation. Drinkability: Not recommended. The best part of the beer is the aroma. But the taste is too thin and evaporates after just a second or two. Very unsatisfying."

"It's not offensive because it doesn't taste or smell like anything. I'm curious which spices it was brewed with because none of them come through."

"Overall the high carbonation and the attention to sweet orange flavor and not true citrus orange flavor make this beer more akin to a soda that a beer, let alone a Belgian Witbier style. It pours just fine but the lack of pleasant aromas and the sweetness make this not very drinkable. I would rather have either a soda or a beer, but not a sodabeer."

"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. The orange smell seemed on the verge of going ""bad"". The color was weak and the overall taste of the beer was weak. Just not enjoyable to drink. Plus, for some reason, Budwiser products seem to give me the worse H/a about half way through a bottle of beer. Honestly, I wanted to like this beer, but no go."
""
"DRINKABILITY: Repeatable all day long, this is a good summer session beer. It provides an interesting flavor shock to the tongue without being overly bitter. Easy to drink and a decent price to value ratio, I'd buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the beer that I default to if there's nothing else. It is not by any means something I would pick up on its own merit. A beer of last resort, if you will."
""
""
"O - Not the best representation of the style but not horrible. Simple and drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, the Shock Top Belgian White is a ""utility"" beer, suitable for fast and inattentive drinking. There is not much complexity to the beer that makes it worth savouring. The taste, mouthfeel and aroma reminds us that it is brewed and bottled in New York, not Munich or Frankfurt. On the pour, it leaves a very thin head that dissipates quickly, with thin, spotty lacing that also absent after a few minutes. The taste provides a hint of orange and lime, with slight maltiness. The smell is a bit metallic, as is the taste, and there is also an aroma of malt that is not followed up on the palate. The texture/mouth feel is thin and slightly syrupy. The beer sports an even, golden cloudiness and a fluid spray of mild carbonation. Overall, there is nothing outstanding about the beer or notable in a positive or negative sense. It is definitely less passionate and of lower caste than German weissbier. However, when considered against its true comparators - domestic beer, it holds its own as a tasty thirst-quencher. I wrote this review as I drank the beer, poured from a can into a beer mug. Can was previously chilled around 40 degrees celcius. Thanks for reading!"

""
"I really like this Belgian White it has the appearance of what you would expect with its style smell though, threw me a little hopping for a little more citrus notes beings it is advertised on bottle, but the beer has great taste easy to drink anytime! I would buy another 6 pack of it!"

"Overall... ugh. Barely even tastes like beer let alone a Witbier. Never would have bought this to begin with, so thank god I didn't."
""
"D - Overall, it's not bad for a macro-brew; but it's definitely not in the same class as most of the craft beers brewed today; didn't try it with an orange as I'm not sure it would enhance flavors or aromas"

"Overall: One of the more refreshing beers out there. Very drinkable but a punch of fruity flavor. It's a shame that most beers out there are either fruity or not fruity, and I have yet to find a beer that has middle-ground. This beer comes close to that medium and is an overall good beer."

"Really not that bad for a BMC product tryin to be a classic belgium style. But still has the mouthfeel of a watered down lager and the big slice of orange that i got with mine after asking for no orange did not help. Taste has some notes of wheat and good yeast because of being unfiltered but still not something that i recommend anyday."

"Overall not a beer worth paying for. Plenty of other good witbier's out there worth your money. With the staleness of this beer, it just falls short of a decent brew."
""
""
""
"This is a beer worth drinking, and one I'd probably like more if I had it more. It looked and smelled better than it tasted. Nice rich color and a good head. Smell was a little fruity but mostly malty and rich. It just tasted plain and empty. There was some good bitterness and the wheat taste was obvious but it wasn't rich or all that impressive. This is, I guess, supposed to be served with an orange wedge, which I didn't have. I can see how that would have helped, but in my opinion beer shouldn't need outside help. It felt pretty dang normal, medium bodied. Worth having, but not impressed."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very drinkable beer and sad to say ""good job"" Anheusere-Busch."
"Really not much to this beer, a shell of the style. Looks dirty but comes off too clean. I prefer my whites a bit dirty with some fruitiness and yeast flavors. Nothing of the sort here. A last resort beer if the rest to chose from is light lagers."
"Not a bad Wit. Not outstanding but worthy."
"This is very refreshing and goes down easy. No noticeable alcohol so very sessionable. This is good stuff."
"It's sort of creamy...I know it's some type of knockoff of hoegaarden or Belgian style wits and it is a poor watered down imitation and it's not as good tonite as I remembered it three years ago but with an orange slice and and hot barmaids! Pour me another lass..."
"Not bad but not good. I think this one was old."
"A bleh witbier. Typical overspiced from the orange peel and coriander and not much from any Belgian yeast strain."
"O: Coming from AB this isn't a bad offering. There are certainly better witbiers out there, but coming from a large brewer, this is a decent offering."
"I was surprised to find that Shock Top is brewed by Anheuser-Busch. I tend to overlook mega-breweries when I'm searching for a new great-tasting beer. I feel like they are all about production and not so interested in creating innovative, flavorful varieties of beer. Thank you, Anheuser-Busch, for making me drink my words. I'll be back for more."
"Flavor wise nothing exciting. Yet nothing bad. Just lemon/ orange peel spice, wheat malt, and yeast. over all just an average Witbier. Nothing offensive just average. But, it is very drinkable."
"Overall, I like Shock Top, but there isn't a whole lot there. Not one I'd hunt down, but one that I'm perfectly content with drinking. I normally pair this or Blue Moon with wings and BBQ sauce, good flavor contrast."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with slightly bland flavours and aromas."
"Overall, an average macro version of a Belgian Witt, that's about it."
"shock top isn't bad. I'd rather drink this than some watered down bud.it pura a cloud orange, similar to blue moon, looks like a wheat beer is supposed to look. The smell is nothing too special light citrus and malts, nothing outstanding. The flavor is slight citrus and ""light beer."" overall this could be a lot worse. It's not bad. The bar I drink at has it for 50 cents on tap on mondays. For that price I drink it up."
"Can: Poured a slightly hazy light orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention and some light lacing. Aroma of coriander and orange peel is more pronounced then I had expected and quite nice. Taste is a refreshing mix with loads of orange peel notes with light wheat malt base. Body is light for style with good carbonation. Better then expected though malt base is too thin and watery and coriander is overshadowed by orange peel notes."
"O - Easy to drink. It's not outstanding but it isn't a bad beer either. Average Witbier."
"O: Nothing worth getting excited over and the synthetic sweet is a bit distracting. There are worse beers out there, but I don’t ever really need to drink this again."
"I had never had this, so I bought a six to try out. Poured into a pint glass, it pours with a light head that disappears quickly. Has a pleasant light amber color. Taste is quite citrusy, which I'm not a fan of. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Overall, not bad, but not someting I would buy again. Not much more than a dressed-up macrobrew."
"I think I actually like this better than Blue Moon, and by no extension at all, Rickard's White, but damned if I'm going to organize a comparative tasting. Anyways, this is enjoyable enough, I would imagine, if it were hot and sunny, and there were no better, preferably proper Pils-based option, but it sure as hell isn't right here, right now, so, my strictly clinical assessment is: not bad for the price, but like its craft beer wannabe ilk, not worth the dumbing down hit to one's soul."
"O: Enjoyable, drinkable and refreshing. A bit surprising that Anheuser-Busch brewed this."
"The Bud of Witbiers. Not bad looking with and orange tinge to a cloudy gold brew. Sizable head recedes quickly. Smell is orangey with note of wheat malt, yeast, and spices. Taste is unimpressive. There seems to be orange flavoring as well as spices instead of the traditional citrus that comes from good brewing. Wheat malt is present and give it something to enjoy. Finish is crisp and dry with a light tartness. Feel is light and lightly carbonated. Not bad but I wont be looking for more of this. Blue moon is a much better macro Wit."
"Comments: Overall this beer is very good, it falls short in a few areas, but it makes up for it with its unique flavor. I can see how up in the north someone would try it and not be convinced by its qualities. But if you were down in Houston, Texas with me experiencing temperatures consistently over 100 degrees, it sure is a great, refreshing wheat ale to have in your cooler. You can bash it in many places, but its drinkability and refreshing flavor make it a good bet for hot summer days."
"O - this beer is nothing special, but I have to give it to AB on this one, it's simple, tasty, and easy to drink. It's a go-to at the Charlottesville Pavilion for Friday's After Five."
"Overall: A decent beer that is fairly light and quite drinkable, although there are many better summer beers out there."
"Not huge on flavor but it does quench your thirst."
"The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, a little bit more thickness would benefit the citrus tastes, the thinness here just feels a little unnatural. The drinkability is quite good, these make quite the good summer pounder, I have to admit that. Overall, a very passable brew. It's nothing jaw-dropping, but can be found for a decent price, is highly drinkable, and can now be found in cans."
"Went into tasting shock top with open taste buds and still was surprised. Not all that impressive to look at in a glass, slightly hazy, head doesn't last. Little stick or lacing. Scent is only slightly reminiscent of wheat, some citrus. Taste is of grain, just sweet enough to want more. A bit of citrus and wheat. Little if any hops. Mouthfeel is neutral. This beer is a nice drinkable beer and may ""shock"" some people. Sorry about that. Got carried away. No game changers here but a solid drinking summer beer."
"While I found this inoffensive, I also found it undrinkable. Lots of white foam on top of the light coloured body. Neutral aroma. Middling though aggressive carbonation. Something orange in the background. In the style, but nothing tasty.A bit of a gateway beer."
"For discerning (picky) palates, this will be equivalent to covering a third-rate cut of meat with extra salt and black pepper--i.e. an obvious band-aid solution. I have no doubt, however, that many will think this beer delicious. I certainly think it's the tastiest beer Michelob has ever put out, and will reach for it again on my next camping trip."
"Overall- not overly impressed. However, I would recommend this to someone that is starting to venture away from BMC and experiment."
"M: Creamy with good mouth coating. Aftertaste of wheat is good. Downfall: Over carbonated."
"A pretty lame witbier. Drinkable without much else going for it; a decent lawnmower brew. Not disgusting, just not really worth going out of your way for. I can't think of any compelling reason to get this again, especially when Hoegaarden is almost everywhere."
"i got this beer at thestoretheother day.Igotin bottleand poured into pint glass. The first thing I noticed is the color which is an intense yellow which is very pleasant. It poured nicely with a one inch head. The smell is fairly fruity and taste is also surprisingly fruity. It has a slight spiced taste with an apricote taste to it. I did not care for it that much. It is a nice attempt to making a fruity beer. I'm sure it is practical for the summer time."
"edit: I didn't even realize until reviewing here that it was a subsidiary of A-B. I actually enjoy this more than Blue Moon right now (the other major foray into craft brew wannabes that I can think of). As much as I am loathe to give them props over anything (just me being contrarian/my hippie upbringing), I have to give kudos to A-B for their entry into the 'giant Terminator robot in ipod's clothing (aka the Soundwave award)' market. Also, it makes me crave french fries. Don't ask why but it just hit me as I was finishing the last half and editing this review. Time for some Five Guys."
"Notes- A craft brew forgery. From packaging to pour, it looks and feels like a craft brew, but lacks complexity and is simply unbalanced. Coors did a much better job with Blue Moon than Budweiser did with Shock Top."
"When poured, a nice thick head forms, eventually allowing you to smell the orange and citrus flavors. The head disappears completely after a few minutes. It smells great and tastes even better. The orange flavors are powerful yet not over the top and the after taste is pleasant. I greatly prefer this over the similar tasting Blue Moon."
"Qute easily the least impressive white ale I've yet to try. Anheuser-Busch strikes again..."
"Sheesh! The Crack and Glug netted me a finger of bone-white head that fell to pieces like a novice criminal under intense questioning. Color was a very cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose was certainly spicy enough and I have got to learn to distinguish Grains of Paradise from coriander, but I am betting on the latter here. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, not outright watery, but not much better than that. The taste was kind of muted, with hints of orange peel, coriander and even some yeasty mustiness, but it seemed weak. Finish was dry and refreshing, even peppery, but I still felt like it needed more Ooomph! A CANundrum - do I take up space in the cooler knowing that I will not be drinking it, but some honey honeys might? I'll err on the side of caution and throw some in as bait. Once I have them on my blanket under my umbrella, we'll break out the Ten Fidy ..."
"Overall- I can't say I'm impressed, after having a couple of brewes from Brewery Ommegang in the past week this does not come close. Blue Moon Belgian White is a better choice for this style."
"I tried shock top because I heard it was all the rave. Then I found it was made by Bud, strike one. I drank 5 of them and had to choke them down, it had a very strong orange taste to it which actually is sickening. Bud is trying to get into the micro brew market but they cant because they simply cannot amke a decent beer."
"Surprisingly, even though I rated all of this a 3.o across the board, I would seek this beer out again due to how refreshing and smooth it was. They promote it to have a spice infuse with it but I could not taste it at all. That is my only true disappointment with this beer. It is infinitely better than a Blue Moon to me although the look is identical just as is the mouth feel. The difference is that A Blue Moon seemed to make me feel like I was drinking beer and giving me the feeling of a full stomach. Shock Top did not give me that full feeling even after a 6 pack. Being a Belgian White Ale, I was impressed but I wish it tasted a bit more like a beer and not a fruity wine."
"Got this witbier on draft in a pint glass. Shock-Top poured a hazy pale yellow color. It produced a night white head that had decent retention. There was a little lacing left behind. The aroma featured malted wheat and slight traces of cloves and orange peels. The taste of the beer is mostly comprised of a soft wheat, sweet malt, clove and orange. There is only a faint trace of hops at the finish. Shock top is light in body, its drinkability is high but its not much more then a lawn mower beer. It might be a good starter beer to introduce to a ""Bud Light"" drinker, but even at that I would suggest a Blue Moon or a Boulevard Wheat over shock top."
"I tried this beer on May 6, 2011 after purchasing at the Queen's Quaq LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer pours a hazy yellow with a huge white cap that quickly dissipates. The aroma is citrus and yeast, the spice is non-existent. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. The flavour is sour, a little wheat, and a little spice, and sourness is NOT a citrus sour."
"Overall, this is a nice beer from AB. Its surprising mouthfeel is something entirely unexpected, and pleasantly so! I could be happy drinking this. It certainly rivals Blue Moon. Very nice!"
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. nothing exceptional but not a bad buy. I bought it because alot of my friends will compare wheat beers to this one and i had never tried it. I'm not disappointed."
"Pours a hazy very pale yellow-orange color with a 1/2 inch white head that fades to a fizzy film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of wheat, spices (coriander), and a surprisingly nice orange scent. Taste is of wheat up front, spices coming through in the middle, and the orange/citrus flavors coming in on the finish. This beer has a nice level of carbonation making for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average witbier but good for coming from AB."
"Overall- I can see exactly why this beer as such an amazing rating, another quality offering from AB here, of course if you can’t read the sarcasm in that one then you have drank one too many shock tops already. This beer is almost absolute drainpour material, the only that that was somewhat promising was the look of it, it does look like a wit beer and goes completely downhill from there. The smells and the tastes are very muted and although getting both a citrusy fruit smell and taste it never really translated to anything orange to me. Would not pick this one up again and the only reason I did is because I never noticed it before at the lcbo and also neglected to notice that this was an AB beer until I got home."
"Layover at Dulles...in the Lufthansa Senator Lounge...and they have Beck's and Shock Top on tap. Started with the Shock Top...never had it before. The color is an unfiltered yellow with thin creamy head. The aroma is powered by citrus and subtle grain. The initial taste is an orange peel then turn a little tart. Certainly would compare this to Blue Moon. It is easy on the mouth and would be great on a warm day."
"The beer is light tan and hazy with virtually no head from my pour. The smell is faint, yeasty, slightly earthy, maybe a bit ""off."" The taste is rather weak/light--moderately sweet, slight citrus, light grain (wheat/oat). It's not terrible and for a macro beer, actually passable. Maybe a good beer to use to help friends transition to craft beer. I have a few bottles in my fridge that a friend left behind--maybe I'll eventually drink them all."
"So this Witbier pours out as a cloudy orange color. The head is deceit and leaves a surprisingly nice lacing. The smell of the beer has some wheat aromas and lots of citrus. The taste is citrusy also. The mouthfeel is decent, on the light side. Overall I'd never buy this beer for myself. I will drink it if it's free."
"Overall, not a bad brew. I know many in the beeradvocate world would love to bash me for that last statement. Truth is, it's time to put the hatred for AB products behind. This beer is enjoyable, especially on these hot days of summer, and priced recession friendly. Also, it is easily attainable. Don't hate, give it a shot."
"I respect Busch for trying to fit in with the craft beer scene, but I also disrespect them for trying to fool innocent beer-lovers with a neat little can with cool artwork that this could possibly be a decent Witbier!"
"Cloudy pale golden colour, 2 fingers of fluffy white head, some lace left behind. Smell is of orange, spice, yeast though most of the orange scent is quite artificial tasting. Taste is of artificial orange, spice and yeast come through but very fake tasting. Thin mouthfeel, big carbonation, light to med weight body. Pass on this, not very good, bad example of the style, half got drank the other half saw the sink."
"-JH-"
"O- not impressed."
"Overall: This is a great inexpensive summer time brew. I'm glad I tried the stuff."
"M: it is easy to drink not to bitter not to sweet, the ending is not very lasting and between dry and chewy."
"Obviously, another weak BMC attempt at brewing craft. Standard witbier flavors, but it's as if they mixed full strength beer with a portion of sparkling water."
"O: Not very enjoyable at all. I wouldn't want to have this again."
"On tap at a small WV brewpub. Served in a 20 short mug with an orange wedge. Color is a hazy straw-gold. Light with a few white bubbles, head is quick. Aromas are simple. Lemon, wheat, and straw. Flavor is delightfully tangy and fresh. Nice light malt and tart fruit. Slight sweet wheatiness on the finish, very refreshing and chuggable. Not my beer of choice, but given the choice of this or Landshark, I was very pleased with my beverage."
"Much to my enjoyment, it doesn't give you that overwhelming fake fruit taste like budlight lime or miller chill does. I would much rather enjoy the calmer and more natural notes of orange in this beer than other Anheuser-Busch citrus infused beers."
"The beer is cloudy wheat with a funky off taste. As a matter of fact that is about the most prominent flavor. It seems like just barely enough barley to take it a notch above bud wheat. Would have been a great beer for $1.75 in a plastic cup at a Blackhawks game, but give me my money back for a $7.00 beer when I thought I was buying something decent."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange-yellow body with a two finger head which dwindles to minimal foam on the body. Smells of slightly metallic orange peel and a bit of white bread. Tastes of orange-y white bread with a slightly dry bread-y finish. Overall, not a spectacular beer but I'll take one for free."
"O: I had this particular bottle at Outback Steakhouse in Avon, Indiana. I had about half of it before my steak came out. I'm sorry to say that I got my first taste of real flavor that night when I ate, not when I drank. Even though I have a special place in my heart for Shock Top, I can't shake the feeling that's it not true craft beer. Not enough flavor, not enough drinkability, not enough reasons to get it again."
"Poured a pale orange, a few shades lighter than the colour of the can itself. Fluffy head of a couple fingers forms and settles to a foamy cap, retains moderately without any lace. Nose is mild, some wheat, light orange and faint zestiness. Taste struggles to represent the witbier stlye, yet still remain under the constraints of feeling like a macro beer, containing a weak BMC lager feel throughout. Some wheat, mild citrus, grain notes and mild hint of alcohol is present in the finish. Some spice (coriander as per the can) makes its way through in the finish as the glass warms. High carbonation, and yet a surprisingly decent body with a bit of weight to it at times. Definitely not hard to put down, and ideal for a warm day, yet nothing special as a wit."
"There are few things better in the beer world than witbiers - and few things worse than Anheuser-Busch products. A combination of the two results in something predictably average: while it is pleasant and agreeable and, frankly, quite appealing, it is also a shamelessly kitschy, half-rate offering that compares poorly with honest, integral examples of the style."
"Overall – I’m not really sure why this beer catches so much hate. It’s not mind blowing but it also isn’t a typical Adjunct beer. It has a fantastic appearance, the flavour is decent, and the price is right. I could see myself drinking a few of these this summer."
"This just came to Ontario. Pours a faintly cloudy pale orange colour with thin white head. Smells of orange peel, some lemon with wheat malt. Fairly clean flavour, a little bit tart from the lemon. Fairly high carbonation level. This is an ok witbier and I wouldn't pass it up, but not going to seek out again."
"I don't give a Schlitz for Shock Top."
"Hey. It is what it is. A dumbed down version of the style. Not completely terrible. Just not particularly complex or engaging or worth ever drinking again."
"Not that bad at all as an inexpensive Summer patio beer and it could catch on with casual beer drinkers, but any real wheat beer fan will just pine for something with more body and character while drinking this."
"I could understand a non-craft drinker going to a bar and getting this thinking that they were indulging in something better than BMC, but in reality is a very short step up. If available, Hoegaarden is a much better choice for a witbier and is, as far as I know, almost as available as Shock Top. But I can't say that I was too surprised with this one."
"T: Again, a lot of wheat flavor. but it seems to be sweetened and the result isn't great. As it warms, it's straight bad news. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and not bad."
"I'll give AB a thumbs up for effort on this. It does have some pretty good citrus bite to it and it is very drinkable."
"Light mouthfeel, but easy to drink. Of course, it pales in comparison to a good Belgian witbier and is not as good as the beer it was obviously created to counter, Blue Moon. But, better than your average macro offering."
"Although i did not taste the spice in this wheat, I did however like the light refreshing taste of citrus. The drink stayed cold and was enjoyed with a crab cake. I stumbled onto this brew at outback steakhouse. When poured into a glass there was little to no head, and was a golden cloudy color, which may turn some beer buffs off. Overall this is a basic beer. I wonder if the brew was any different before A.B. mass produced?"
"O - Not a bad wit, especially given the brewer, but it was by no means a favourite of mine. Could use a bit more up front on the flavours and the lack of carbonation made it a bit sub-par."
"Overall: A good beer for a reasonable price. Great for drinking on a hot day, would recommend this beer especially to someone just starting to drink alternative beers."
"There is nothing special or unique about this beer. I really don't have much more to say except I would probably prefer something differant. For instance a Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat."
"Edit 4/6/11: I'm also picking up some apple flavors in there this time, but it doesn't add enough to merit it additional pointage."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on March 26, 2011. It pours a cloudy olive-yellow with a thin head and good carbonation. The aroma is typical for a witbier but less pronounced with its subtle malts, wheat notes and lemon zest. The body is slick and creamy. Limited to no spices in the taste but a bit better in the wheat department."
"D: Very drinkable, good for a summer day. But tastewise there is much better out"
"d- its not not a bad beer but not a great one either, better beers for the price"
"D - It took all of me to finish this."
"The beer was a murky, dark yellow color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. There was some sediment in the glass. The smell is very faint, I only noticed small traces of orange and wheat. Taste is similar, orange, wheat, lemon and a bready citrusy aftertaste. The beer is very light and the carbonation is low. This was a pretty forgetable beer."
"D - This beer is ok. It has many characteristics that would be great on a hot day after mowing the grass. However, the beer could be much more flavorful, memorable and refreshing, if it had more of the traditional citrusy and spicy witbier characteristics."
"D- Very drinkable, especially on a summer day. I could easily kick back a few of these and be off to a nice evening."
"Truth be told, not bad. Just not very complex. I could drink 4 of these like water. Drinkable - yes... Exciting... No"
"Dr: I'd have it again at this price, especially if I was just drinking casually. Don't serve it with an orange in it, lads. A beer is meant to be experienced as it is created. I have to admit, my expectations were low, but this may be the best AB brewed beer I've had (because that statement is saying a lot...psh)."
"Drinkability- It is an average beer to drink but only enjoyed one today. Some days are better than others as far as freshness with this beer. Always ask for an orange with it to finish the last 6-8 ounces after reviewing."
"Pours to a frothy white head with fine bubbles and a cloudy gold color. Aroma is a pleasant mix of orange, spice (peppery, lemony coriander no doubt) and wheat. Flavor is on the weak side but acceptable for style: orange notes with coriander finish, nice creamy wheat flavor and residual sweetness to offset the spice and citrus. Good mouthfeel and an overall decent offering from AB."
"Overall, like some others have said, if I had the choice between the usual American brews at a bar/restaurant and this one, and no other micro-brews were available, this would be my choice."
"D - This is a drinkable beer, though not a great example of a witbier if you are a fan of the style. Personally, I'd like a little more tartness, and a lot more hops. I will buy it again, because the flavor/price ratio is very good, and if I want to put some beers out for friends, this is a good one to have in the cooler."
"D: drain beer. Not impressed"
"Not as awful as i thought but it still sucks. I'll take a Hoegaarden, Harpoon UFO White or even a Blue Moon before this. Thank god it was a gift."
"The world is changing."
"D: This is a witbier that I will drink again."
"Fits the style well, not much else to say. I've had it on tap too and I think it was better on tap. Quite surprising for an A-B beer considering it's actually good. Give it a try."
"not again, i will not do this to myself again."
"Head started off good at two fingers, but didn't last long. No lace. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart and the beer is quite hazy. Smell of honey, malt and citrus. Taste is sort of bland, some wheat and malt taste, a little bit of spice come in after the initial flavor is gone. Has a mellow mouthfeel, not enough to call creamy, but better than water. I would not go out and buy this to drink, but I would not turn it down if it was in a selection to drink at a party."
"Overall: It's a beer targeted to the masses and for what I think Michelob is trying to accomplish they did a good job."
"Shock Top is another deceivingly American beer. Seems foreign, but it's nothing special, just another Bud product. It's really good for a cheaper beer, and it has a crisp wheat taste. Worth a try, but it get's a little boring and it's not a beer you can have a full six pack of in one sitting"
"I had seen this beer a few times before, but tried it for the first time yesterday. I really enjoyed it. Very crisp refreshing taste with little to no aftertaste. Seems like this would be a great summertime beer. I'll definitely be looking for it in a few months."
"Feel this would be adequate for summertime consumption. Not my fave but would definately have more if given a choice of any other AB products."
"I favor it over Blue Moon because it costs a good deal less. :-)"
"Verdict: This beer is a fair buy for some, but I've had better Weissbier and I found the flavor to be severely lacking, which amongst other minor issues (Taste and flavor based, mainly) does not draw me back to invest in any more of this brand, at least on my dime. However, for those who like Weissbiers or anything wheat-heavy, you might get some cheap thrills from this one. C- (2.7)"
"Mouthfeel is where it takes a dive here. It feels really watery and doesn't hold much substance. However, drinkability is still good. Fairly light for a beer of this type."
"More transparent than expected; golden hue, thin white head, thin retention, spotty lacing. Very slight lemon in the nose, but underwhelming overall. Ditto the flavor; thin lemon'ish taste. All-around, very thin feel, and overly-carbonated. If you don't put a slice of orange in this, it's a modest step up from a water with lemon."
"D- To be honest you can and I did drink a lot of this. The ABV is low enough and the flavor is light that makes this a easy drinker. I praise AB for trying to break into the belgian white profile but lets bump up the flavor guys!"
"Something about this beer just didn't seem quite right when I had this at the pub the other night. All aspects of this beer seemed off. The murky/muddy look of it through the glass was a turnoff. The taste was odd and despite not being very flavorful, it was a hard drinker. I'm guess not a big fan of Belgian Whites (Shock Top and Blue Moon as my only 2 reference points)."
"overall, I would not recommend this beer"
"Drinkability: Brewed by Michelob/AB as a mass-market adjuct beer, I found this to be non-offensive, yet unimpressive."
"Finally, the beer does the same thing to your stomach as budweiser. Basically a rolling squeaky loud digestion process for a whole day. I only had 5."
"It's hard to balance the score for this review since I like a number of witbiers more that this one. I'm a fan of the style, but this beer is just a slightly above average example of it."
"This beer is what originally got me into to craft beers and the belgian white style. Unfortunately there is nothing else truly spectacular about it... For a Coors product though , I'd say this is a step above the rest."
"When pouring this beer it is an orangish yellow in color with a thin white head with very little retention and not much lacing. It has little carbonation in it and the smell is of a citrus and wheat aroma while the taste has some wheat with a strong citrus taste that blends pretty well with the wheat and hops in it. The body is a medium feel that is smooth and very drinkable. I will admit that to me this is one of the better tasting belgian white wheat beers."
"The body was nicely smooth and pretty typical for the style. Drinkability was good, but lost some points because the was so bland, why would you drink more than one? Overall, this may make a good ""training wheel"" beer for the non-craft drinker. Get 'em started with this and then they can expand their horizons."
"Not much a feel in the mouth, but tastes OK. If I'm in the mood for a wheat beer and it's available I'll have it, but there aren't many wheat beers that I would reach past to grab one."
"Drinkability: Not something I'd look forward to drinking on a regular basis."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is medium light. Since I got that solvent taste in the beer it was off putting and I really did not want to finish it. Maybe I got a bad batch but it is what it is."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a decent head. relatively unimpressive smells. has a good crisp taste with a lot of citrus and very sweet flavors. decent mouth feel and pretty good drinkability as one would expect from a Anheuser-Bush product. This beer overall is just quite mediocre and i highly doubt i would buy it again. i think I would only find my self having this one again if it is offered at a friends house."
"The taste is a refreshing fruity thirst quenching. A little bit watery for my taste but very drinkable, because it feels very lite. Great summer beer, but needs to be served cold."
"D- Easy enough to drink, just boring. Fruity. Weak. Might enjoy it after working up a sweat mowing the grass and you want something light."
"D- High- if it were hot out, this ice-cold would hit the spot. But then again, with stuff like Harpoon UFO available for the same price, why would I reach for this one? Drinkable, refreshing, and mildly tasty, but I don't think I'll ever buy it."
"This beer is what it is. A slightly above average immitation wheat belgian not really worth another look considering the micro-brew wheats now available."
"this is michelobs best and yet im not a fan of michelob but they get my vote on this one.i could have a session with this.A+ in my book!!!!"
"D - Very drinkable. A little light and bland overall, but also very smooth and east to drink."
"I'd rather have this one than Blue Moon most of the time and if all they have is BMC then Shock Top is an easy choice. Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a thick white head and good lacing. Smells of wheat and orange peel. Tastes of orange peel and other citrus and wheat goodness. Mouthfeel is decent and drinkability is too."
"Drinkability is again, fine. Word of the day is, fine. I won't be buying this beer again, but if it's around, and there's only bullshit to be had, I'll be saying Hi to the mohawk orange again."
"- Not that great of a brew... drinkable.. ice cold.. on a hot summer day... and because there isn't a killer beer around. Meh.."
"Pretty good pour. I've had it a few times from draft and recently bought it on sale at my local store. Pour wasn't bad. Nice light yellow color. Head was good. Nice citrus smell. Has a bit of hop and perfume taste. I didn't add and fruit. In the end I think I would of bought a 6 pack instead of a 12 pack."
" The flavor is mildly yeasty w/ subtle citrus peel and light wheat flavor, more or less flat in the flavor dept with gentle spice in the finish. I do not generally support AB, but tried to give it an unbiased review -like a pale wheat with light banana and orange, just ok IMO."
"Pour is not too bad. Slightly hazed apricot color with a white head. Smell goes down hill with some fake orange and citrus notes coming through atop generic sweetness. Taste just brings fake fruit galore; not sure why anyone would need to put a citrus slice in this. Mouthfeel is overly thick and cloying. I think I might actually prefer Bud Light."
"Overall: Might be a tad bit better than Blue Moon. Try it."
"Finished of my glass with some barbecued tilapia. Good."
"Value: WAY overpriced at around $7.79 per sixer."
"Poured from bottle into Ikea beer mug. Light amber color with a nice white head. I actually couldn't smell much of anything. Maybe a hint of citrus but that might've been my brain imagining it, since that's what I would expect. Starts slightly sweet, which is then quickly overwhelmed by a relatively bitter taste, followed by a very light citrus finish that doesn't quite manage to overpower the bitterness. More drinkable than a lot of other macrobrews out there, I guess."
"Drinkability: Let me say, even with the beer being made by Anheuser-Busch, I was completely open to giving this beer all fives. Unfortunately it is far too watered down for any flavors to come out."
"D: Tolerably boring. That's about all I can say."
"Pours an attractive, hazy orange with a frumpy white head. Aromas are yeasty, with hints of orange pulpiness. None of the spicier notes or more openly citrusy elements that make other witbiers interesting. The first thing I notice upon sipping it is the texture, which is extremely smooth and creamy, but lacking the same level of effervescence of most other witbiers. Flavorwise, there's not much going on besides a lightly sweet wheatiness and a touch of orange juice. Doesn't taste bad, but neither is it very interesting."
"Tastes kind of like an orange, which is kind of neat, but only in moderation. It's OK to have just one, but the second does not go down as well. But it doesn't have an offensive smell, look, or taste. It's just a decent beverage, but not much of a beer."
"It may not be the Beer of the Month anymore at Finn's, but I wanted one anyway. I don't know why either. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, light lemon peel, and what seems to be coriander. I'll be honest, though, I'm not sure how much of this smell is from the orange slice (I didn't ask for it, by the way) and how much is from the beer. The taste holds very light orange zest, cardamom, orange peel, and some light flowers. The body is quite light, with an active carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a weak wit, not entirely bad, but not something I'd necessarily smile for while ordering."
"Nope"
"This is a nothing beer. Its not anything special, no special flavors, or strong hints that makes this beer standout to me. I bought a six pack just to enjoy on a hot summer day, and it was good for that. It was a cloudy beer and although some people say a hint of orange, I added a extra slice of orange."
"As the bottle shows, This is a summer beer. Taste good on a hot day or a warm summer night. While its got a good drinkability it does fill you up eventually. Not like other beers than make you have the ""munchies"" This is a good relaxing beer not really a party beer in my opinon. Has the great wheat taste with hints of orange. Beer is cloudy tho which is normal of most wheat beers ive had."
"It is available just about anywhere so if you can't find your favorite grab one of these."
"Cheers!"
"Not a bad beer, was surprised to see that it was made by AB, it's better than their other beers I've had. I could not really taste the citrus or other spices in it. It's taste reminded me of a light beer. While it's not a memorable beer and I won't buy it again I would drink it again if offered."
"It looked like beer. It had some words on the label that implied that it was of a variety that I might like. Alas, the flavor was dilute, it had a a hint of artificial citrus flavor, and weak malt extract flavor. The composite flavors held together, but they didn't amount to much."
"Had a couple of these at a friends house, which were left-overs from a party. Overall, I was put off by the very artifical aroma and taste of the oranges and spices (I don't want to think about what chemicals are in here), but when I drink it, it goes down very smooth and refreshing. In fact, after a night of 'sessioning' some higher ABV brews, this was a welcome drink at the very end. Basically this is AB's response to Blue Moon, I can see this going over well with the non-craft crowd who think they're trying a 'craft' beer. I can't really say anything else bad about this because I did enjoy it, but I definitely wouldn't buy this personally. I'd rather just have a regular Budweiser or something that I feel isn't as artifically made. At least I got a couple of pry-off bottles for my homebrew out of the deal."
"The beer is a hazy bright, almost artificial yellow-orange. The witbier smells mostly of orange, cinnamon and clove. The taste is dominated by the sweet citrus and yeast spice with a bit of wheat present. The carbonation is rough, a bit on the low side and prickly on the tongue. The beer is thin and the finish is a bit on the sweet side. Not a terribly interesting or complex beer (i.e. not really ""Belgian"") but drinkable and refreshing on the beach."
"Note: on my second pint I asked for an orange slice. I say, ""If you want to throw an entire orange in it then do it!"" Normally I don't like fruit in my beer but there was nothing sacred about this one so what the hell, orange slice it is."
"D: Pretty decent take on the style. A bit mild and thinly stereotyped, but refreshing nonetheless. Better than than Bud Light. Much better."
"D-drinkability is pretty easy to drink"
"Not one I'll search out again, but I'll never turn it down. There's something about these macro orange witbiers that just tastes like summer to me."
"D: Decent beer, much better than I expected from AB. Seems to go best with food."
"D: Not the best beer by any means. Normally not a ""fruit in beer"" person, but I think I'd take the orange in this case as it makes up for a lack of flavor."
"d- ok, it's drinkable, just not much flavor here, and i would rather drink many other different beers before i would drink this again."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden/orangey color. Head slowly dissipates and leaves a film on top. Has the traditional clove and banana smells of a wheat beer. tastes wheatey with a little bit of citrusey orange. Overall this is a nice beer to drink, it surely isn't perfect, but its refreshing. Even though I am not a big fan of AB, I think this is a reasonable beer."
"D- unimpressive. Reminds me of a slightly improved version of Bud or Miller GD"
"Drinkability - I think this is a great brew for hot summer days and cookouts. A decent beer overall."
"A good beer for the price- cheaper than Blue Moon and almost as good. Great summer brew, not sure I'd go for it in the winter as I like darker beers in the winter months here in Connecticut. I get a sixer of this at least once a month during the Summer and Fall. Nice citrusy taste. Michelob did a good job here!"
"I was pleasantly surprised at the inviting aroma this beer had, good balance of spices and citrus. Though I wasn't blown away with its taste I would recommend it as a good buy for a chain restaurant option."
"D: Its very decent. If you cant find blue moon or are just a cheap ass and dont wanna pay the extra dough for blue moon then this is good. Nice dinner beer if I may say."
"Pale yellow in color with a small film of head and alot of bubbles. Smells of clove and a little banana. Tastes ok at first with alot of spice and banana flavor up front but falls flat quickly leaving the mouth with an empty feeling. Also, I noticed the flavors get less and less noticeable as you approach the bottom of the glass. Very fluid mouthfeel with very little body. Not a great example of the style. Refreshing brew that achieves it's goal of appealing to the masses but thats about it."
"pours a murky off yellow color with a small head and some ok retention with a smallish ring..smell is of clove and fruit some spice but its faint..tatse is the same it has a Belgian look to it but the flavors are so thin and faint..its like they tried to make a great brew but just did not put enough ingredients into it..thin mouth feel as well ..not a solid attempt of the style and unflavorful"
"While surely not special, this beer offers much more character from the bottle when compared to the draft version."
"m/d- bubbly at first, then smooth. high drink-ability, its lite, so."
"This was one of the few options on tap at a weekly outdoor music series here in Boulder. Appearance is a hazy straw color. About a finger's worth of head that leaves an average amount of lacing when gone. Smell is a little lacking, nothing special. Taste starts off ok; however, about halfway through things go horribly wrong. Kinda tastes like someone went on a rampage in my spice rack and dumped a bunch of crap in my beer, way too overpowering. The spiciness is way out of balance in my opinion, but if that's more your style I could see this being a very sessionable summer beer. However, overall a swing and a miss in my opinion."
"D-its ok, i guess. id choose it over blue moon most of the time, so i guess the brewer accomplished what he set out to do."
"I bought a six pack trying to decide if I want to get a keg of it. I'm still undecided. It seems like a nice summer beer, so maybe I'll get it since it's summertime."
"This was an interesting beer. The taste was very much like that of a Blue Moon, but slightly less sweet. I had this one out of the bottle unfortunately, yet it was still a very refreshing beer...something that would go great with a summer BBQ. Taste was citrusy, slightly sweet, not much in the area of hops, and yeasty. Good summer beer."
"D- Good. I actually liked this more than my current macro favorite Blue Moon. A damn decent attempt at a classic Belgian style. Great for summer drinking."
"Pouring a hazy light orange, this beer has no head and no lace. It looks rather turbid, not really how I expect my witbiers to look. The nose is rather poor, with a lot of fruit character, quite dominated by an orange juice like sweetness that does not work when coupled with the coriander that's also quite prominent. Wheat character is dominated by these characteristics. The palate, while similar, is a little more palatable. Opening with a blend of orange juice and coriander spiciness, this is rather overwhelming on the palate. Quite a bit sweeter than I care for, this beer has some wheat flavor before drying on the finish with a lingering orange and coriander character. It feels rather over-carbonated, and isn't particularly pleasant. I couldn't care enough to actually consume the entire glass. Not recommended."
"I'm usually not a big fan of Belgian White but this was tasty. I don't like Blue Moon very much because the added flavors are too strong. (I was surprised Blue Moon has an A rating; this was much more my style.) I got this in the Michelob sampler. Don't know if I'd buy Shock Top alone, but I'm happy to add it to my menu for a little variety."
"Notes from 02.09.10 SEA-TAC"
"Drinkability- a cold one on a hot day might be more drinkable but probably not, I didn't really like it. I wouldn't drink it again."
"The fact that they even mention this as being a ""Belgian Style"" is a slap in the face to every decent Belgian beer out there. Without a doubt the bottom of the line in any Witbier I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Actually a beer you might see a person who wants to appear to be drinking smart but really is just a throw blanket on another failed attempt to persuade real beer aficionado that they might be drinking smart. Went down very clean and crisp though. I would recommand to my friend who's recently trying to spread his good beer drinking wings. Cheers!"
"D: I was unaware AB brewed this when I ordered it. I guess that explains why its just not that great of a beer. It's a session beer, if you want to call it that, though I personally wouldn't want to drink another as there are far many better beers out there. Mine was served with an orange slice, which greatly improved the flavor of this beer when it was finally added to it."
"It's definitely AB's answer to Coor's Blue Moon, but I actually think it's better."
"It's not a bad brew, but nothing compared to a really good craft beer or German pour at Oktoberfest. It's better without the stinking orange chunk that they seem compelled to add, but I'm not an orange fan. I would rather drink this than a Budweiser but it's still only just OK."
"This was no doubt a beer created in response to Coors' success with Blue Moon. The look of the beer is light straw. THe smell is not very impressive but might smell like clove if you were to try very hard. The taste is not bad for a BMC product but if I am going to buy gas station beer I will go for a Blue Moon before I buy this again. The carb was fine and this was a drinkable beer just as, I am sure, it was designed to be."
"Like the nose the orange and lemon are the dominant flavors. Some spices are vaguely noticeable. The wheat character seems to be nowhere to be found, Body is thin and moderately carbinated. Easy enough to drink, but disappointing in the end. I kinda figured that this would be similar to Blue Moon, but it seems to pale in comparison (and I am not really a fan of Blue Moon)."
"Very drinkable. I must admit I'm a bit surprised that Michelob put something out like this. It's not good enough to make it on my regular drinker list, but I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered."
"Hazy light yellow color with a large head that disappears very quickly. The aroma is watered down citrus which is barely noticeable. The taste is also barely noticeable. Some citrus flavor, but nothing special. Light bodied, over carbonated. Nothing to get excited about."
"Taste is very dry and yeasty, it's got a light orange finish it's really fresh and dry. It's not bad but not very complex or flavrful."
"Pours out to a slighty hazy, golden color in the glass. Faint yeast and citrus are present in the nose. The taste is mild, yet flavorful. Contradictory, but true. There is pronounced, but subdued, citrus flavor, that leads to a easy to drink beer. A good warm weather offering."
"I bought a 12er of the Shock Top because my wife likes Blue Moon and I wanted something different, but still something along the line of a Belgian white beer. Initially, I was impressed with the color and aroma. Very citrusy and the color looks delicious. Quite a nice shock on my first taste. A decent amount of citrus and great flavors. Even though this is an AB product, I'll be buying it again. Should be a great beer for after mowing the grass and doing outside work."
"Poured from the bottle into a weizen glass, Shock Top is a hazy, golden-white color with a nice foamy cap. The nose is sweet and citrusy with a touch of wheat earthiness. The taste follows suit with a slight spiciness that was not apparent in the nose and the citrusy character takes on a more tart, lemony note. The mouthfeel is a light medium body with a soapy carbonation and slightly drying due to the tart finish. Overall, not a bad beer and a decent try at a witbier for AB. This is definitely a warm weather beer, good for sipping on the lawn mower."
"Hey at least Anheuser-Busch, Inc. is trying something a little different..."
"D: Goes down ok, not very tasty, the artificial flavoring is a tad much. I've had better of the style and would opt for something else."
"Overall, not a great brew, but a great party drink and something that would go well in the summer. You have to know what you're getting into when you buy this beer."
"Shock Top purs a bit fizzy, with a cloudy, yellowish amber. The beer smells of citrus, not much else. Taste is the same, a bit of lemony citrus, no grapefruit from hops or anything. Finish is dry and clean. Beer gets a bit to sweet as it warms, and way too soda like. Nothing offensive here, but not worth buying again."
"the look, smell and taste of this beer tends to just average, its not a beer you would sit back and go ""wow this is awesome"" but for what it is it's not bad, the beer goes down easy and is definetly perfect for a nice summer day when you want something refreshing. i suggest you drink it with out an orange cause it already has a citrus taste to it, and if u add the orange it will be overwhelming"
"But, on the other hand, it tastes good, and goes down real easy. It is citrusy, making it a great beer for a hot summer day."
"Overall nothing special but still better than typical sporting venue beer and is a nice selection for sporting events. My favorite at sporting venues in the Michigan area."
"Somewhere in the void between good and bad, this beer will undoubtedly continue to do well in the marketplace, but for my dollar, I'd choose many beers over it, any day of the week or time of year. For style, it's too refined in the spice department to really pique my fancy and the brash, tangy malt character means nothing without the sweetish, rich pils back that I crave. For all of it's faults, it is an extremely drinkable beer, just not what I'm looking for."
"i will not be trying this beer again.... but i am sure thier are many people who enjoy this beer,,,,its just not my thing"
"The beer starts out ok but then it takes a turn and it's something i would drink. It's a better offering from AB then i thought it would be."
"I was at Jillian's on Lansdowne St, and all they have on tap is Sam, Bud, Guinness, Stella, and Shock Top. I thought I'd try ST for the hell of it. Served in a plastic pint glass (nice) with a soggy orange slice. Looked pretty average. Smelled like floor cleaner, so that was a bit of a turn off. Tasted like a weak attempt at an orange flavored witbier. Again, nothing special. Mouthfeel was the worst aspect of this beer. It was way too sugary and sticky sweet on your palate. Bit of advice: don't let this beer warm up, it only tastes worse. This brew is drinkable, but I would not order it again. Luckily we left after I finished this one."
"Despite my rating this is one of my favorite summer session beers. It's fun, it's easy, and I don't feel exhausted after having more than my share!!"
"My brew was served at what felt like 40 degrees F. As it warmed it smelled like a peeled orange 4-5 feet away."
"there's not much else to say about this. it's a OK white, and one that has my macro drinking friends want to try the new and different beers that i bring by."
" ~ I have to say thi beer is not bad by any means. I recommend it to those interested in trying a witbier brewed by one of the big boys."
"Anheuser-Busch made a pretty solid attempt at a wheat beer. Probably not quite on the level as Blue Moon or Hoegaarden but still a tasty beer. Appearance is probably not quite as dark of an orange as Blue Moon, but still smells and tastes good. Drinkability is pretty good as well. Roughly the same price range as Blue Moon. If you like wheat beers, really can't go wrong with any that I've tried, and Shock Top is no different."
"Witbiers aren't a style I usually go for so I don't have much to compare it to. Pretty weak overall though, although I don't find it offensive. Would be nice on a summer day after some yard work, etc."
"Shock Top is a refreshing non offending mild offering that I could see being quite popular in especially in the Summer. I would never turn one down if offered to me but I doubt I would be buying many. This six pack was a gift from a co-worker and I'm glad I've had the chance to try it. On a par with Blue Moon from what I remember of that beer."
"and found at plenty of watering holes."
"M&D- No bitterness, fruity and sweet on the way down with some fizz from the carb. A step below medium bodied which is bigger than most wit's i've come across. This is not something that i would consume for refreshment in the summer. Needs to take a step down in body and increase the spice/wheat and bring down the citrus."
"Overall/notes: Not too much to say about this one. For comparison's sake, I'll just call it an inferior Blue Moon. If you find yourself with only the BMC alternatives, this could be a good choice."
"D: A decent ale, much better than I expected it to be."
"I thought this wasn't too bad, though it wasn't much different from their regular american lagers."
"Smells too similar to BMC stuff as well. Taste leaves a bad clove, tobacco and non hoppy kind of citrus taste in your mouth, like someone put a cigarrette out on a lemon and then threw it in your beer. Mouthfeel, you just want to get it out, it doesn't develop, it gets worse, and thus, isn't too drinkable."
"Drinkability: I was expecting something along the lines of the other macro witbier, Blue Moon, but Shock Top was a bit of a disappointment. I didn't expect much, and it failed to reach even those expectations. This is *just* above a drain-pour from a drinkability standpoint."
"D- a very drinkable beer. Smooth enough to drink several, but refined enough to save for a desert beer."
"Poured into a stemmed pilsner glass. Cloudy yellow with little head and not much lacing. Aroma of oranges come through. You are overloaded with orange lemon and lime flavors which I was prepared for. Actually found it very refreshing on a hot day. Thought it was good but beware if you don't like fruit in your beer stay clear of this one."
"Drinkability is average."
"D- Nothing much to say about this beer. The only thing this beer has going for it is its drinkability. Goes down smooth and you could drink a good quantity of it. Maybe OK for a summer party."
"D: best skipped. Nothing remarkable about this one."
"What was that? This beer has a strong cereal flavor to it. There is a citrusy flavor in the front of the mouth. I'm really confused. Its bland, followed by citrus, followed by a wheaty flavor and then a strong aftertaste. I don't like this beer. Review done."
"Look was a murky gold color, wasn't bad looking, but not great either. Let's just say unless it calls for desperate times, I'm probably not reaching for that cool smiling orange slice again."
"Citrusy, yes, but it could use an orange or two more. Drinkable and tasty for a macro beer...but nothing to write home about. This is a good beer for people who aren't living in the real beer world yet and need to take the first step. Good in the summertime."
"Light beer. Filmy aftertaste. This is bad."
"Drinkability is about average (not because it's great, but would go down well in mass quantities from a pitcher)."
"I almost, sorta, kinda, like it a bit...but I'm hoping there's a prize at the bottom."
"Decent offering from one of the big boys, comparable to Blue Moon."
"D: I haven't drink many beers from michelob, but this one is very good!."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer, kinda like water..."
"Drinkability: If I wanted lemonade, then I would have bought that."
"This is a pretty standard Belgian White brewed on this side of the Atlantic. Crisp spiciness to the smell with some citrusy and bready notes. Taste is spicy, orangey, cerealy. Mouthfeel is nice and thick and juicy. Drinkability is fine as well. I'd put this a little higher on the list of bw's I've tried actually."
"Good orange taste. The blend is nice in the mouth, with orange hitting you first then some more subtle spices coming in next. It's very drinkable and I could see myself definitely bringing a six of this to a party... got this off of a sample pack, wish I had more than one beer to sample."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some hints of citrus and spices. Taste is flavorful and refreshing. Good balance of spices and citrus. Medium bodied in the mouth and goes down very easily. Overall this is a quality brew."
"D- Eh, it wouldn't be my first choice, I have had this on tap before at a sports bar, again, eh"
"Drinkability - high drinkability, can suck theese down all day."
"D- While I could really drink this all evening, or on the patio on a hot summer day, I just don't feel that this is on the same level compared to the Hoegaardens' of the world. It's an attempt though and I wouldn't shy away from it due to it's easy drinking character."
"Drinkability: Not impressed. Definitely don't go out of your way to try this. You could do worse but you could also do a hell of a lot better."
"Poured a cloudy dark yellow with moderate white head. Aroma of sweet citrus, spice and hint of malt. Refreshing on a hot summer day. Not up to par with other macro witbier wannabees, but much more pleasant than a pale adjunct lager. A decent session beer."
"Drinkability: I won't be buying Shock Top again, but I'll have a heart since college football started: it's inoffensive and drinkable, which it is."
"D: A pretty bland wit. Goes down and easy and it's unoffensive, but there are too many better wits to come back to this one."
"D - Very drinkable. I think that's what Bud was going for with this. Kinda bland, kinda weird feeling, but definitely sessionable."
"Drinkability...more like grossability. Avoid."
"I will say it was refreshing for the condition I was in though I would not seek this out...ever. Once I found out it was made by Anheuser-Busch when I got home, it all made sense."
"Notes: I had this on tap at the beach and I can definitely say it was better out of the bottle. For one it was colder and two I poured mine with a head unlike the bartender."
"D- High-ish because it's watery, but it's kind of a blah beer for me. Good for a summer day I guess."
"D: Although my review of Blue Moon, having taken place during my BA infancy, probably doesn't reflect it, I feel that Shock Top holds up pretty well in comparison. I can't say for sure which I'd prefer. Obviously neither is a world beater - they're both macro interpretations of an already crowd-friendly style, but for a refreshing summer beer this works pretty well."
"A good effort for a macro brewers to try and make something resembling (if in looks alone) a low level witbier. If this is the best the bar your're at has, order it. Otherwise, steer clear."
"Pours like a slightly more orange-tinted BMC offering. Smell is macro with some citrus on top. Taste = bud heavy with orange. Goes down smooth. Very drinkable if not flavorful. For some reason this tastes much better to me right out of the bottle (more hops and citrus) this one I just poured is pretty underwhelming."
"Eh, so-so. Tastes very similar to Blue Moon to me, but the coriander is more pronounced. About the same in terms of quality. Not very bad but there are so many better witbiers out there."
"This is fairly drinkable, but I would not want to buy this again."
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a one finger white head. The smell is of grain with a hint of some fruit, but it is very faint. The taste is grain up front and some orange on the back end, but the taste is slightly watery. The mouthfeel is good, the beer is smooth and lightly carbonated. The overall drinkability is okay, its not as complex as a micro, but for a macro a decent job. I will give them credit for the effort."
"give it up to the best damn beer anheiser busch makes! naw, this isn't the worst beer, just one for less sophisticated tastes. but, just like blue moon did, if it can open the eyes of an inexperienced beer drinker...lets use this one to our advantage!"
"D: very easy to drink and refreshing."
"Reasonably drinkable. I would not necessarily seek it out, but given the selection on tap on this day, it was a good choice."
"D - This is a very easy drinking beer, and I could easily have see drinking several on a hot night, but I wouldn't be buying. For the price (Like $7.50 a six) I can think of much better beers and fresca would be just as refreshing. I didn't know Anheuser-Busch made this when I saw it in bars... sneaky bastards!"
"Leave it to AB to do a great job of selling this crap via billboards. I had to try it seeing all the hype. It's even worst than Blue Moon. If you want a good BW go with Sam Adams Imperial White or Hoegaarden. This style has not been reproduced well by any of the macrobreweries and it's a shame as it is great summer beer."
"D- This is a drinkable beer, in that it is thin and refreshing, although not what you would seek in looking for flavorful Witbier."
"Conclusion: It's a decent stab at the style by A/B...it might be good for getting your macro-drinking friends to expand their horizons a bit and branch out towards craft. That being said, while it's not really bad in any way, I'd definitely take a Celis or Hoegaarden above this, which are both w/in about the same price range and annihilate this on quality."
"It is a much lighter version of a white ale. About the quality that I have come to expect from the Anheuser-Busch company; better than most really cheap beers but can't really hold its own against others in its style. I would have another but it would not be my beer of choice. I would recommend this to someone who is used to really light bodied beers and would like to transition into heavier styles."
"I guess it isn't horrible.. but I would only drink it again if it is free."
"D - Yeah, its a decent BMC summer beer if you want to escape the normal adjunct lager with out paying very much more but it certainly is a poor example of the style."
"T- The lemon came through, so that obviously changes the experience. Fairly solid drink. Nothing that really comes out. Your traditional wheat."
"smells like orange and lemon with a mix of wheat. nothing special, tastes similar. not much to either, just felt like a watered down wheat. pretty plain, not much to say."
"This brew will not offend anyone, but will not impress anyone either. A drinkable beer, that maybe would be a decent intro brew to bring to a party where macro beer drinkers dwell."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a small white head. Its got that 'yellow' banana aroma in the nose paired with a Belgian-esque yeast note. Sweet and somewhat artifical in flavor, banana, obviously is dominant, some mild spice and a small citrus blast on the late finish. It leaves a long slightly bitter, slightly spicy aftertaste. Not terrible by any means, its sweetness adds some serious weight when sitting in the stomach."
"Appearance and smell were average, but the taste had just enough citrus/spice to be better than I expected and deserving a review (perhaps only because it was on tap). Very drinkable on this hot summer day, I had two."
"I've been avoiding this beer ever since I saw it. I was afraid I would like it and have to support the BMC juggernauts. Well this was offered to me free so I couldn't refuse. It looks good outta the gate. Nice orange color with 2 inch head. The smell was very fruity dominated by orange citrus. The taste wasn't that bad ( S#%T!) I knew it. Fruity wheat beers just get me. I could see poundin a few of these but I won't allow myself to be tempted by the evil AB empire."
"It seems this is what A-B was going for...that doesn't make it that great, though."
"Beer was moderately carbonated, which gave a nice crisp mouthfeel. Good. Flavor was pretty tame for a Wit. I could sense the orange rind, lemon zest, and slight peppery finish, but it was all toned down. Because of the mild nature of this beer though, drinkability is higher in my mind. I could down a few of these at a barbecue for sure."
"Hazy, bleach blonde body with a big airy head that lasts for a while and leaves a few blobs of lace behind. The nose is lime zest,wheat malt, and coriander. Citrus peel, overripe banana and mild belgian spice flavors with a sugar cookie finish. An okay summer beer. The mouthfeel is a touch watery and thin. A lot of the summer seasonals I encounter blur the line between american pale wheat ale and witbier, this is one of those."
"D - With the above being said, I could slam these since they weren't very fizzy or tasty to me."
"Overall, worthwhile and worth the purchase. I've had better witbiers though."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. I could see myself tossing a few back without thinking twice. I didn't expect that it would be this good to be honest. I was impressed and it caught me off guard. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Not recommended. An all-out assault on Coors Blue Moon that utterly fails, in my opinion. It's just a far too thin and lacking in all its qualities, making for a rather unrewarding wit."
"Fairly good value."
"drinkability? i'd say prety good if you like the flavors, i know people that don't like citrus as much and they wouldn't drink more than one of these, but if you like it than i'd say you could drink a few of these before it get to be too much. not something i'd drink all day though."
"Certainly not a classic but hand me a couple of these after transplanting some trees in the yard and I'm a happy man.."
"I can see this appealing to young girls and crossover beer drinkers who are trying to seem worldly, but even as far as uninspired pale wheats go, this one is near the bottom of the barrel."
"D: This is an OK beer. Nice for a session and decent for socializing. It's not exactly a prime example of a Wit, but it does its job as a thirst quencher."
"Pours a hazy pale orange. Smell is faintly of citrus. Taste is watery, slightly tart, and a hint of malt and citrus. Mouthfeel is thin, very high carbonation. Somewhat drinkable, overall this is a very poor example of a witbier though. Just barely above a light lager, I would rather take a macro lager over this. For the money this is not worth it, MUCH better examples out there."
"I won't actively seek it out again, but won't turn my nose up at it either."
"D: I guess it is refreshing but more than one or two in a row I would not want. It would be too much orangy flavor for me."
"D- Very refreshing. I wouldn't buy a 6-pack, and if I had a choice of this macro and blue moon I'd choose blue moon. That said this is very refreshing and worth an order at a bar if there is nothing else to drink."
"D- I wouldn't buy it again."
"This is a refreshing beer, I can see having one or two on a hot day, it's just not interesting and there are better options to be had. I was hoping for some coriander to add some bite and sharpness. Overall not a bad beer, it's light could be a good drink with seafood."
"For what it's worth, I would take this over any other Anheuser-Busch product any day."
"Overall, a really bad witbier effort. Terrible. Don't recommend and definitely one and done for me. Why did they even bother with this one."
"Drinkability - A reasonably drinkable beer. May get a little tiresome after two beers though. I can see how this would appeal to a lot of people."
"Drank while in Hawaii. On tap, the color was a very light hazy yellow with very little foam and no lace. The smell of sweet citrus filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had the flavor of orange and a touch of lime. The finish had a little tart feel on the palate because of the citrus flavor and finish. Not a bad beer. Pleasant to have dinner with again!"
"For a Belgian witbier, this is definitely lacking. For a refreshing and easy drinking beverage on a hot day, this isn't too bad. It's definitely a step up from an adjunct lager. Hopefully it can help some people by being a gateway into craft beers."
"This beer is from the Michelob Wheat Beer Sampler. Pours a cloudy, carbonated orange-gold color. Pretty nice looking head on this one. This beer has a pleasant flavor with wheat and hints of citrus coming through in the finish. This beer, while not as complex as other offerings, is quite refreshing in its own right. While hanging out with some buds at a local pub, this beer was the best one available. Sometimes we take what we can get."
"Drinkability: Meh, not much going on here. Not bad to drink, but not great either. More like a citrus soda than a Belgian wit. Don't think it will give Blue Moon a run for its money, let alone a true Belgian."
"This is quite thin stuff, especially if it sits for any length of time above five minutes. At first it's ok, but it becomes less firm as carbonation dies down. It tastes like a sweet wit with orange. It's a little too sweet for my taste, and a bit generic."
"Yeasty aroma has a decided citrus overtone, mainly orange. It comes out of the bottle a hazy golden with not much white head. Flavor is wheaty and has a firm undertone of lemon and orange. Texture is fairly smooth and just slightly fizzy. Nothing spectacular, but worth a try."
"Keep in mind I just had an Allagash White and now I am comparing a Shock Top. I poured into a nonic to a half inch of head which quickly went away. It looked good. There is not much of a smell, faint citrus. I wish I could say that it had some taste, not much going on here. It felt watery and I guess it could be drinkable, but why when I can have Allagash?"
"Overall, pretty average. I would prefer more flavor."
"One of their better beers. But if you can't make a wheat beer, your in the wrong business. Pours a yellow color with a thin beige head. The nose has wheatish malts and the usual stale hops. Again more staleness in the taste. Watery body goes down with harsh carbonation."
"Drinkabilty- Like this one alot more then i remembered or thought I actually would, for someone whos not always a huge fan of these styles this is actually a pretty good beer of the style, a nice beer for a nice warm summer nite, a little sweet but still one i could picture as an ocassional sessioner"
"I could easily drink several of these on a warm night. A better beer from Michelob."
"D - Very light for a White. Very drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy amber with decent looking white head but not much retention. Smell: orange, lemony wheat tanginess, and...grainy Michelob pale malt character. Taste: lightly bready with vague sweet citrus and spice, very light, perhaps too light. Mouthfeel: light and fizzy. Ehh, in general I prefer my wheats of the weizen variety instead of wits, and AB certainly did wits no favors with this one."
"Did I like it? yeah I did, is it one I would try again? Hmmm don't know, but if I had the opportunity to grab a free one some place I'd probably jump at the chance."
"Credit where credit's deserved. Good brew, AB."
"Poured this into a Bud Light pint glass in order to keep with the AB theme. Hazy orange appearance with a fluffy head that disappeared quite quickly. Typical Witbier scent, though somewhat muted. As for the taste, I think most give this no chance because it's from a macro trying their hand at a craft type beer. While there are most certainly many better witbiers, this one has its niche. The flavors are obviously toned down to please the masses. It's very drinkable and I'd certainly rather down a few of these during a round of golf over Bud Light."
"D - Could I easily pound these all day? Yes. Would I like to? No. There are far better beers on the market to waste my time drinking this again."
"yes this is ""drinkable"". I was afaid of this beer because I had heard bad things. Guess what? Dont believe everything that you hear, This was the saving grace of the sampler."
"D= This beer is 97% the same as Blue Moon, and unfortunately for AB, that other 3% is not as good as Blue Moon. A bit too ""wheaty"" some how, and the aroma is just not perfumey enough for the style. Good enough to wash down pizza with but I wouldn't want to be sitting around drinking this by itself."
"The folks at Yellow Dog included a slice of orange with this beer without my asking for it. Normally I find that annoying, but in this case I was glad for the slice of orange. It was much tastier then the beer and helped to clean my palate afterwards."
"as promised,wheat ,oranges and lemon. Flavor is much the same with a moderate wheaty malt backbone,some citrus fruit(lemon&orange)and a hint of hoppy spice,medium carbonation,fruity aftertaste,quite sessionable. Overall not offensive but I drink A LOT of Oberon and this falls WAY short of that mark."
"Slight citrus aroma in the glass. The beer looks like a wheat should I guess: cloudy. As far as flavour goes it's not really my kind of beer. But for what it is I guess it's OK. One pint was enough - I switched to Yuengling."
"Got this on tap at Outback. Decided to try it. I normally do not like a beer with a fruity taste, I'm a beer that taste like beer guy. Honestly it was good, had to have a second glass. Taste was smooth, went down well. Had that hint of fruit flavor but didn't overpower me. Would order again."
"drinkability: overall not good for peopel who like beer, but a great crossover beer from macros. Especially if they like Blue Moon."
"Brew was a cloudy light yellow. A little sediment at the bottom of the bottle, but not much. Had about a half inch head that didnt last long. Minimal lacing at best. Had a slight lemon citrus smell. Also a little malt caught the nose. Tasted a little sweet and also had a lemon flavor. If not lemon, then definatly citrus. Just a slight bitter taste. Felt ok in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. I could drink a few of these, but I wouldnt want to make it a session beer. With the lemon flavor, I think that someone that drank wine coolers might enjoy this one."
"The review for this beer may have been better had the way I was presented this beer had beer better. Having any beer for the first time while it is in a platic cup is not the best way to tasts test so I will revise my review in the future."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Pretty good actually. Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to grab a six pack of this if you're looking for a cheaper beer with class (paid $8.79 a 6 pack)."
"I had it on tap a while ago (at Busch Gardens on a hot summer day, incidentally) and recall being much more impressed with it, so perhaps I just got a bad bottle."
"D - It has the same ""drinkability"" as we've come to love from Bud Light. If I was in a bind, craving a belgian and 100 miles away from a good one, this would do. Far better choices for $1-2 more."
"Its a fun beer to serve due to ""roll at the end"" pour instructions, the opaque sunny color and the pleasant nose. For the kind of beer it is -- an A-B near-mainstream beer -- I think this delivers extremely well. Have found it generally is a far better compliment to American-Mex cooking than a Corona with lime. But watch out, with some foods it can manifest its bitter notes unpleasantly."
"Overall, there was way too much orange/fruity flavor going on here. I wouldn't want to buy this, because I know I could find a good hefe instead."
"This is a mild, easy drinking white, but still has alot of the characters you look for, just a little watered down. On the appearance front, the head dwindles fast but I love the color. It is a very pale/cloudy yellow. There is zero lacing. Taste is good, it is very drinkable. I like it."
"Poured a cloudy yellow with practically no head and no lacing on glass. Unfortunately it came with and orange, so the smell was dominated by that. All I could smell was orange. And again the orange was in the beer, so the taste was very orangy and creamy with a tiny hop flavor and no bitterness. Honestly it did taste pretty good. I'm a big fan of orange creamsicles and this beer reminded me of that. Not bad, not a complex beer but tasty and very drinkable."
"Future outlook: Well, this was decent for the style, but certainly nothing to jump up and grab you. Unlike their Hop Hound Wheat, this one might actually be worth trying....especially if you are paying 1/2 price."
"It was very drinkable, I would definitley drink it again, but wouldn't think of choosing it over an Allagash White or even a Blue Moon."
"EDIT 2: Had on-tap again, still has the body of soapy water and almost no flavor. I am utterly shocked that this has a C+ average, maybe my expectations in a Wit are too high."
"D 3.5 - it's a bit sweeter than some more traditional witbiers, but it's not a bad try for AB! It's available everywhere, and it's usually a decent price. I order up a Shock Top any time as a craft alternative if a bar is cursed with all macro offerings...."
"Overall - It's a decent beer, but there's better choices out there. You won't regret it if you buy this one, and drinking this one is no problem, but you would be better served by Blue Moon or Hoegaarden, which are just as readily available and taste better."
"D- A decent attempt at a nice Belgian white, but I personally would stick with hoegaarden or blue moon."
"cloudy yellow, 2 finger head. Belgian White? really? im not getting that at all here. its an okay beer, but Blue Moon is FAR better if that tells you anything. get a bit of orange and lemon taste. But this is WAY to carbonated, and kills it for me."
"Mouthfeel is decent. Moderate amount of carbonation with a smooth finish. Overall a very easy drinker. Like I said, I didn't have many options, but this was better than the Bud Light and Rolling Rock that was offered. Had a couple and had a good time during Mardi Gras."
"Man...they almost got it."
"Drinkability is high. This is a summertime beer that quenches the thirst and doesn't go bad with citrus fruit like lemon or orange."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer is light bodied but not thin and watery. The carbonation works well with the beer. The beer is pretty smooth. This is definately lawnmower beer. I could see sucking down several of these in an evening. I am in shock."
"Extra: Again the ale had a lot of charisma in esthetics. The beer was kinda' a let down though. I love Michelob... Amber Bock is to die for. This beer had all the flavors for a good complex beer, but just was not abundant enough. A side note, the label on this beer was amazing. Totally trippy."
"Serving type: bottle poured into a hefewiessen glass."
" I don't believe that I am one to be able to properly indicate what flavors I taste in many things (although I continue to learn and try), and so I will just say that for no matter what the money you may be asked to pay for this beer, it is not worth it. Unless it came in a 30-pack of cans for ten dollars."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another Shock Top Belgian White. Very easy to consume."
"not exactly the worst wit I've ever had, but not too impressive overall. The pouring instructions are unique, especially for an AB brew, but it does add to its ""uniqueness"" i suppose. This beer really lacks a good balance, which is due perhaps to the overwhelming amount of citrus that it was brewed with (orange/lemon/and lime peels)."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is half an inch in height and recedes quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of faint tangy wheat, and caramel malt. There is no hint of coriander or orange peel. The taste is like the aroma. There is some tangy wheat, and some cardamom, but no coriander or orange peel. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied. Overall, this is a horrible example of a witbier, and it is really hard to stomach. I will not be drinking this again."
"Notes: Decent summer-type brew, if you're in the mood for fruit."
"overall I'd only get this on-tap because it was one of the cheaper beers and wasn't American Adjunct. It's pretty drinkable for the most part and is crisp and refreshing...It would make a better summer beer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is yet another attempt to take a shot at the Blue Moon market-share, but unfortunately it's just as lacking in substance, it's poundable but it's not one that I'd pick."
"Pours out an extremely hazy yellow brew with a thin head.Looks mildly carbonated.Not too much in the smell department. Smells of light spices and slightly yeasty.The taste is dumbed down,,but i enjoy it.Very subtle orange notes,,not very much else.Mouthfeel is carbonated ,,thin..A very drinkable beer. Could be an excellent lawnmower beer.Could be used to slowly convert a friend to craft beers."
"Poured into a 14 oz wheat glass. Golden hue with plenty of haze and a head that dissipates fairly quickly. Had a strong citrus notes and lime / orange dominated. Tasted slightlly hoppy and was easy to drink. Has a nice mild finish. Would be a decent beer for a sunny spring or summer day."
"Poured this beer and it appeared with a wheat colored that was cloudy. The white foam head that it first originally poured with did settle quickly and left almost no traces of lacing. The aroma that wafted up from the beer was that of a belgian style beer with hints of the oranges. The taste of the beer followed suit. Which the flavoring of a AB beer having this good of a fullness was a surprise that I am sure to recommend to others that are looking for that light beer."
"Pretty good overall. Pretty good flavor, and nose. I really like the orange hints. It pretty much tastes like it smells. Light drink, with an okay feel. Very solid quaff."
"Originally I said that I didnt think I'd stick with this one and would try something else. Now this is definitely one of the beers I will be mixing up my purchases with."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Easy to drink and would be refreshing in the summer, though not the best I've had of this style."
"Served on-tap. Looked like your standard summer brew with all the smells and appearance, repleit with the orange slice. From there it went down hill, the taste wasn't offensive, it was just virtual non-existent. Like the actual beer had been watered down with . . well water. Maybe it was because it was snowing outside and the middle of December, but I wasn't that excited by this effort. Seems like a attempt to cash-in on the whole beer with an orange slice fad. I'm sure I could drink a couple of these, I just really wouldn't want to. Wake me up when you have something interesting."
"Note: Used to be known as Spring Heat Spiced Wheat."
"If you like Blue Moon give this on a shot, if you are a Hoegraden fan, it may or may not impress your taste buds."
"Drinkability: Average beer but a sub-par attempt at of the style. I would probably just spend the few extra bucks to pick up some blue moon."
"M/D - Not a bad choice for a cheap inexpensive Belgian style, would recommend to serve it to a new beer drinker to try to turn them on to this style of brew."
"notes- i'm not apposed to anheuser-busch beers, i'll try them and give them a fair shot, but this one really missed the mark."
"Draft served in a standard pint glass, but no orange slice on the side. Pours an orangish yellow color body, chilled haze and cloudy. Has a large and creamy white head, not much lace or retentionm. Spicy, yeasty aroma, and some orange coming through. Some wheat flavor along with the yeast and spiciness. No really strong flavors, lots of citrus orange, slight hoppy finish. Thin and a bit of a watery mouthfeel. Not too bad, no complaints, and it seemed to be a popular choice from watching the bartender."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's not unpalateable, just not to style. For me, I can't see drinking more than one of these and I certainly wouldn't purchase it again. I would drink one if someone handed it to me though."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow with a single-finger fluffy head. The smell is mostly orange and spices. The taste starts off with sweet orange that gives way to some spices and bready yeast that lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is watery with some fine carbonation. It's a drinkable and tasty beer, but kind of a one-note interpretation of the style."
"Aroma is fruity, but overpowering. Pours cloudy orange with a small white head. Strong, overpowering carbonation. Flavor was a bit watery, very citrus. Overall not bad (especially for an Anheuser-Busch brew), but there are better whites out there."
"Pours clear and bright orange-yellow with a decent white head. Nice wheaty and sweet aroma, but just a little thin. The taste is the same. Leans more on the American wheat side, but spiced. The carbonation is out of control. Its like drinking a shaken-up club soda. Not great, but also not bad."
"A clear golden color with a slight to average head. Little lacing and the head quickly disappears. Strong fruit smell with a noticeable coriander mixed with the cleanliness of a lager. The fruit flavor is lacking in the flavor and it is more or less a lager. A light beer with slight carbonation. Easy to drink but the fruit flavor is to weak."
"Poured to a cloudy yellow with thin white head that lingered awhile and left okay lacing. Nose was essentially non-existent, except for a whiff of orange and bubblegum at the very outset. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, yet neither tangy nor spicy like I would expect, and the taste was bland. Not an overall bad drinking beer, but just dIdn't really do much for me in the way of a Belgian Witbier."
"Served freezing cold, and it was hard to taste anything. Waited to warm up a bit before tasting. Pours an orangish yellow color body, very opaque, can't see thorough. Has a big creamy white head, that is lasting. Spicy orangy aroma, with some wheat. Some hoppiness in the aroma too. Watery, creamy palate. Some orange flavor. Not a very strong flavor. Some sweet spiciness in the taste. Not too bad, actually. But it could use a little more flavor."
"Sample at Dave & Jacquie's in Defiance, MO. A-B continues their non-threatening foray into craft beer. Pours a lightly hazy yellow-gold color with a thin white head that diminishes quickly. Stringy lacing on the glass. Light spice and citrus in the nose. Light-bodied and effervescent with mild yeast, spice and citrus flavors. The finish is clean and fruity with a mild spice lingering. Nothing offensive or interesting going on here."
"I picked up a six pack of this from a 7/11 store. Wow, was I surprised. I was a little wary after seeing it was made by AB but wow, this turned out to be a nice surprise. Pours a light lightly cloudy amber color. Has a nice head that stayed around longer than I thought it would. Tasted lightly of orange, mango, and corlander. I do not usualy like fruity tasting beers but this one was just right. It was very refreshing and really good. I have no problem buying another 6 pack of this surprisingly good beer."
"D- These are easy to pound back but the spices in the brew could hurt your stomach later. Not bad for a BMC brew."
"(On tap at Applebees, Morgantown, WV)"
"D - I can see maybe having one of these on a patio or on a hot day when you have a thirst. But the orange flavor just seems too much. It doesn't show any character. It just tastes flavored, if that makes any sense. Not something I would look for having again."
"Cheers!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"On tap in a hotel restaurant. Poured pale yellow into a pilsner glass with minimal head and little lacing. Slight citrus hops aromas and flavors, with some spiciness. Smooth on the palate with minimal carbonation for the style. All in all, not a very impressive beer."
"Drinkability is low. This isn't a great quality to begin with, and the fact that it tastes artificial makes it worse. Save your money and try something else."
"bottle from the communal fridge"
"D: Pretty drinkable. Since the beer is so simple and goes down so easy it makes it easy to drink one after another. The flavor is sweet and refreshing. Good yard work beer. Not shabby."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast, some spice. The taste is malty/yeast, not much spice. Light body. Not drinkable, I was kinda syked about this brew with the nose, but the taste is pretty bland/watery, a big disappointment."
"D) Easy and light, some flavor to it, not bad at all. A fair summer sipper."
"Love the logo on the bottle btw, an orange with a wheat mohawk and sunglasses, very cool look."
"I won't be purchasing this beer EVER again."
"Plop me in a beach chair, stick one of these in my hand with an orange slice and I'll watch some bikinis stroll by. To bad its october, damn it."
"Had it on tap while having dinner at Applebees. The appearance was an incredibly murky yellow look with some pretty good lacing on the sides. Thin head. Aromas were ok, not too strong but also too conservative than I would expect. The taste was comfortably subtle in bitterness with a little off-metallic taste. Lemon flavors mixed with some slight biscuit hints. I did find it really refreshing, but a little on the light, watery side. Overall, not a bad drink."
"Anyway, so now I'm slightly pissed off. The reason I brought up the seasonality of the beer is because at first I thought it might have been the end of the Keg. My 2nd thought after I taste the beer is that they must not sell much of this stuff because it tasted as if it had come from a dirty tap, or that just could be par for the course for this stuff. It looked like your typical Belgian white, not as cloudy as some of the better ones (Allagash etc.) but it just tasted a little off. Again I've never had this beer before and probably won't again. It had a stale taste to it that wasn't very pleasing. I soldiered on and finished the beer since I had already paid some outrageous price for a 3/4 glass of beer. I think the favorite part of drinking a Belgian out of a bottle is the extra yummy at the bottom of the bottle. This is hard to duplicate in a tap beer."
"D - Wasn't going into this with any expectations... didn't come out with anything positive. Worst beer I've had since I started reviewing beer."
"Nothing to write home about, but a decent brew when you have limited selections at a bar and want something that goes down easy. Good on a hot day; I prefer it to blue moon."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle to Weizen glass a dense cloudy yellow gold with two inches of white foam head that settled to a quarter inch with some spotty lacing. Expected a strong orange smell from the Mohawked Orange on the label but not much in the nose, just a hint of wheat and citrus. Weak taste here of wheat and mild citrus. It had good carbonation and was very easy drinking. This is OK at best, not a solid representation of the style and the false promotion of Orange dominance did not help it in my scoring."
"It's a bit stickier at the lips than your normal beer."
"D.-fairly easy to drink, was a little heavy in the middle for my personal choice."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good and I would drink it again."
"A cloudy yellow beer with not a great deal of head. Smell was pleasantly spicey. Taste was better then Blue Moon, having alot of fruit and spices going on in the finish, but it had a bitter taste that seems to be trademark in every macrobrewed beer I've ever had. Mouthfeel was very bubbly, the carbonation got me quite bloated. Still I wouldn't have minded a second. In my oppinion it's not the greatest beer ever, but it is a pleasent drinkable white beer."
"Overall, seems to be a fairly mild entry into the style. May be good for someone trying to branch into this type of beer as they won't be overpowered by spices and/or yeast, but there is enough of these components to give a glimpse of what is possible in this type of beer."
"I wish people didn't know this was an AB product because I thought it was a great beer. Much better than other Wit's I've had from more 'prestigious' micros. So damn smooth and tasty and at a great price, wha more can you ask for?!"
"Do yourself a favor and go with a Hoegarrden or some other good representation!"
"D. Overall this is average drinking at best. Surely beats most if not all other AB products, but I will be leary of this one as well.."
"Not disgusting or offensive, but not WOW either."
"My fellow reviewers make a good point. I had this beer pegged higher, and thought folks were being snobbish at first. Then the palate adjusted, and the beer warmed a touch, and it went from ""pretty decent"" to ""entirely average""."
"Drinkability - an average wit; I'd prefer a Blue Moon os Sunset Wheat to this, but wouldn't turn it down."
"Cloudy, light orange body topped with a two-finger head, white and quickly dissipating. Thin lacing clings desperately to the glass. Nose is mellow wheat yeast, citrus, a touch of citrus zest, some mossiness, and a nearly imperceptible hint of coriander. Taste is pale wheat, orange and lemon. Goes down easy, with coriander emerging and a dry and short finish. Good carbonation but the body is thin to the point it's unenjoyable. Overall, not bad, refreshing, but lacks character and surpassed by nearly every other beer in the category."
"This beer certainly stands up to other mass-produced American white ales."
"Shock Top is Anheuser-Busch's answer to Coors popular Blue Moon. I feel that Blue Moon has a slight more flavor than Shock Top. A good [beginning] introduction to a Belgian style white ale [wit bier]."
"I actually didn't know it as AB unitll now...just FYI for myself."
"Pale, cloudy sort of yellow color. Nice aroma-somewhat spicy and a tinge of orange. Clean and crisp flavor-slight level of belgian yeastiness. Mellow spice-some coriander and orange-very minimal but it is there. Good mouthfeel-very crisp and somewhat dry. Enjoyable enough beer, not overly offensive as far as wit beers go. Training wheel beers I like to call these. Not my style to begin with but enjoyable enough on a hot day. I dont care for the slick packaging."
"Not sure what the deal is with this beer. There are plenty of adequate Wits on the market and even a few really good ones. I would not have this again. Boring."
"Drinkability> Would probably give this less if i could. I haven't felt this strongly since I had my last lightstruck beer... only this one didn't taste skunked, just super weak."
"D- not world class, but it would have higher drink points if the MF wasn't so off-putting."
"D - This is okay. Doesn't taste like a true wit, more like an American Pale Wheat."
"Because this tasted like orange soda to me, I was not impressed with the mouthfeel or drinkability. Not something I would ever go out of my way to have again, but worth trying once for the experience."
"A decent interpretation of the Witbier. The best AB ""craft beer"" I have tried thus far. Very easy to drink, great for summer/spring."
"Okay beer that I could drink when better choices are not available. I do applaud AB for trying to get some variety in their approach."
"Freshness date on the bottle, always love these and wish every bottle had one. One finger pure white head quickly faded to a thin layer atop my brew. Cloudy banana yellow color. Aromas are a little muted and the citrus is hard to detect (esp for beer sporting an orange with sunglasses and a Mohawk on the label). The flavors are a little more defined and the orange does come though along with some lime peel underneath and a little wheat. Too sweet for the style and the spices are hard to detect but it does get better as it warms up. Light body and a pleasant mouthfeel but carbonation is little too vibrant. Good effort for A-B and a good alternative for those who do drink A-B products and want some variation."
"Drinkability: I didnt know it was an AB product till I looked at the lable (which is why I picked it up anyway). I could drink quite a few of these on a hot day and being over %5 ABV I would enjoy it."
"Allagash White from Portland, ME (New England/Northeast bias aside) is strictly the best American interpretation of this style so far. I'm eager to find some others. This is worth a try on a hot summer day chilled (room temp doesn't suit this too well)."
"I didn't even know that this was an AB beer when I ordered it in CT. I had never seen it before. But AB or not, I knew that this beer was a bit of a mess. The taste slams you with its overpowering spice. This beer is to witbier as pizza filled Combos are to real pizza. It runs down a check list of elements to qualify it as a witbier, without any attention to the quality of these elements or how they work together. The best thing about this was the mouthfeel, because it was light enough on the palate to be passable for most people on hot summer nights."
"I guess I'm just turning into a beer snob a bit but I really didn't care for this. There are so many other representations of the style that are so much better. My advice would be to check the others out first if you can."
"D: Despite a poor taste, the mouthfeel makes the beer rather drinkable during the summer. I was hoping for a little more, but I was not impressed much at all. On the lighter, I can probably chug this beer or play beer pong with it, so it is not a complete waste."
"Got this one on tap at Tony Roma's at Universal Studio,tried something different,did'nt really know what i was getting into,but i was thirsty.Very hazy looking brew,cloudy off yellow,kinda like a urine sample,yeasty looking,some bubbles thin white head and mild lacing.Nose was of orange's,mild spice,Taste was not as bad as it looked,kinda tarty,with the orange flavor in there,spicey,yeasty,with wheat tinge,lite to medium mouthfeel to it,went down rather easily,thirst quencher,not really much for these wheat beers but this one i enjoyed it at the time,not something i'll go out of my way for but worth a try."
"Overall: not for relaxing and enjoying but for drinking and drinking and drinking and...."
"Pretty basic, orange and spice taste with w tiny bite on the end. Not impressive and got worse the further along I got until I finally gave up with about a third of it left in my glass. Not something I'll have again as it left a lot to be desired."
"I have to admit that I have a predisposition towards not liking Anheuser-Busch products, they've just never ever impressed me. Utterly dissapointing white ale. Completely average appearance, with dull uninspiring aroma (smelled just like Budweiser). Palate was medium to full, very dry for a wheat beer with a moderate astringent feel. Flavor was very acidic with a thankfully short finish."
"D - I enjoyed this beer, maybe even a hair better than Blue Moon though I'd have to compare them side by side. I'll probably pick up a sixer of this before the summer's out."
"This beer has one of the oddest, eye-popping taps around: a transmogrified orange with sunglasses and a mohawk. For $3 at a local bar, I took a whirl with this one. It came with an orange slice and while I typically hate fruit in beer I decided to just go with the flow. Glad I did. This beer tasted almost like a Sunkist soda. VERY orangey. I like Sunkist so I liked this beer. Not sure I could drink several but it was enjoyable. I was surprised when I got home to see that it's an Anheuser-Busch beer. You'd think it would be in more bars. It's better than most of that macro-brewery's selections for sho'. Simple, but pleasant. I actually like it better than the oddly much-lauded Blue Moon."
"Not a very good example of the style. Cloudy orange appearance was nice, but the smell and taste seemed way too sweet and overdone. Orange/citrus taste was overbearing and artificial. Medium body; somewhat crisp feel. Way too many superior Witbiers to bother with this again."
"Looks right with the cloudy yellow colour and the white head. The nose was kinda citrus but it was hard to tell. The beer is really too sweet for the style with not much of an aftertaste. I could not really drink much more than a 8oz glass which considering I love Wits for their drinkability says something"
"The rest we'll file under ""If you don't have something nice to say..."""
"But all-in-all, a pretty drinkable beer as a refresher on a hot day like today. I could easily put away a few of these unless the overpowering orange sensation started to do me in and make me thirstier than I was before."
"D- Not a bad summer beer. Decent offering from AB."
"A refreshing summer brew, for sure. A respectable effort by AB."
"D - Decent drinkability and fairly easy to put these down. I enjoyed the experience of trying a new beer that I had not had before, and would not turn this down if offered to me. Obviously not the best to style, but a decent effort at hitting the mark."
"One thing A-B does do right is the Born On Date. Too bad more brewers aren't into the full disclosure every discerning beer drinker deserves. Ironic that A-B does it, because I doubt your average Bud Light fan could give a shit. As for Shock Top: cool name and label, a worthwhile choice if you're faced with a cooler of A-B stuff in a pinch...and not their worst, by a long shot."
"Overall: good example of a classic belgian wit considering its from a domestic brewing giant."
"A-B's direct competition to Blue Moon, and they aren't discernable between eachother. This is the modern chick beer."
"Pretty nondescript, pretty harmless, not terrible, but I probably won't seek it out again."
"Lightly cloudy yellow tan in color. It offers minor white suds and similar lacing. The aroma is polite, mild lemon bread aroma, pleasant. Effervescent, light bodied bread and a hint of alcohol in the flavor. Very easy drinking and refreshing with a faint orange/lemon note. It's weak, I would prefer a little more body. Not horrible but not complex at all, not rich, just passable for the style."
"Overall- Not the best Witbier, but it's a nice switch-up from A-B. I'm not going to seek it out, but if a taplist was limited I wouldn't hesitate to order it."
"D - A Good Summer Beer on a hot day, but that's it."
"Drinkability: not bad, I find the beer more drinkable than most macro products.. and I don't generally care for witbier. As far as other big name wit's, it really falls short. I'd rather have a Blue Moon or even a can of Wittekerke. Not a bad try, and I'll be able to finish this one before heading to bed shortly, but tons of room for improvement"
"Pours cloudy and pale with a fizzy, white head. Aromas of pale malts and possibly rice syrup(?) with very faint hints of citrus and white wine. Familiar wit flavor and sourness but really only a shadow of the greats; hops are not evident. Body is a bit too weak and the finish is not pleasant. Not a terrible beer but there are far, far better wits out there. This is obviously Anheuser's Busch's response to Coors' Blue Moon. Just not good enough."
"Got this one not realizing what it was, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. Certainly not a good beer by any means, but as another reviewer said, it's definitely better than most macros. Appearance was weak, a light too-yellow color with a very small head that dissolved quickly. Mild nose of citrus and wheat, which followed through in the flavor, which was strong on lemons and weak on most other things. Again, not bad, just not much there. Body was a little thin, but not too bad. Overall, not nearly as bad as it could have been."
"The beer didn't look much different than any other AB product. There was no aroma to speak of. The label promises spices, but there were none discernible. The rating says, 1-awful; it's not that the flavor was awful but that there wasn't any. The mouthfeel was like low carbonated water. Even though the body is light, the drinkability factor is below average since there's really nothing to keep me coming back."
"This is a decent macro, not a great Witbier. I appreciated the sample, but wouldn't grab this in a beer store."
"Notes: this is a light tasting beer made (in my opinion) for easy drinking. It does not taste that good but it sure goes down easy."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer. Not bad for a WIT.Have had better."
"It had a decent head immediately after pouring, but this quickly disappeared, and like everyone has noted, there was no lacing to speak of. There was very little aroma, just some slight citrus. My first sip was fine, with orange being the dominant flavor. While drinking, though, the flavor became less and less enjoyable. Fairly weak overall. Mouthfeel was fine, not heavy but not too light. Its drinkability was obviously hurt by the bland flavor. Not a bad beer, but definitely not worth buying another 6-pack."
"Probably best described as a good choice for the novice ale drinker to try and leave the undrinkable grocery store favorites in the cooler case."
"Pours out to a cloudy, slightly milky pale gold, forming a modest white head which quickly recedes leaving not much lace at all. Moderate carbonation. The aroma is fairly weak, surprisingly. There is some subtle wheat cracker notes, some macro twang, ruddy coriander and a faint fruitiness. Mouthfeel is soft with a light body. The taste is somewhat weak, too. The coriander gives it a ruddy flavor on top of the macro twang, and this barely lets the fruit peels have any say. I'd much rather go without the lemon and lime and just dump more orange into it, but then it would be called Blue Moon. This is pretty bland. My GF likes Belgian Wits, but she didn't care for this at all, and I have to agree. This one's not even refreshing on a hot summer day. Skip it."
"All in all, not a bad offering."
"This beer poured a clear golden straw color, which threw me off since it is a Belgian White and I would say all that I have had in the past have been hazey. The carbonation level was fairly good. The head that was created was pure white and pillowy, not long lasting and no lace. The aroma was average, wheat notes, some oranges, breads and spices. The taste pretty much reflected the aromas, decent wheat, hints of citrus oranges, and a tad lime in and out and finished with a bready feeling on the back of the swallow. Not much on the mouthful, it was the first hint and reminder of who backs this brew A/B. Drinkable, well yes, better then her sisters of A/B, and if it were on tap and nothing else was available, I would get again."
"D: Not too good since it lacks flavor."
"Drank very easy, a bit more body & complexity & this would be a nice Wit. Still would be fairly satisfied, not happy if this was the best beer available"
"Pours smooth, decent head, nice color for an overfiltered-macro-wit, I assume they are using real wheat and avoiding rice. Coriander, orange peel are there... but lends like an added powder or artificial syrup."
"M/D: Light and bubbly, it was not grainy nor heavy which made it very good to drink and something that I would highly recommend."
"I had this on tap at the Bay and Main in Greenport, only because the server had no clue when I asked which brewery this beer came from. It is one of the better A-B products, although that's not saying much. What you'll get is a very mild, inoffensive, middle of the road, innocuous Belgian Wit that won't offend, but won't challenge anyone's tastes either. It certainly looks good, it has the orangy yellow haze, white foamy head, lacing, and retention. The aroma is slight and it has the floral characteristics of the style, albeit toned down. The taste is similar in that you'll get the orange rind, coriander, floral citrus, perhaps a touch of pineapple. You won't get much clove, spice or anything else that would make this memorable. It is refreshing, easy to drink, and also forgettable."
"If you want a great tasting Belgian White brew, Shock Top Belgian White isn't the answer. It isn't terrible, but it fails to impress and its flavor will frustrate most who sample it. There are tastier witbiers that cost less and taste better."
"I like that the Anheuser-Busch fancy beers taste similar to more expensive counterparts. I think other Belgian Whites are better than this beer but this is good beer for the money. It's got a hazy and cloudy yellow-orange hue and not much head. It smells earthy and spiced like orange peels. Has a decent taste. I detect orange peel bitterness and a kind of spiced flavor. Maybe clove? The label says coriander... Maybe that's what I'm picking up on. It's got a nice constistancy and texture and the right amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink."
"I didn't like this much at all. I appreciate that AB is trying to put out different stuff, but this seemd like it was trying too hard to be Blue Moon with the orange already in it."
"Straw in color. Not quite as ""white"" as some of the others I have tried. Solid white head follows the liquid down. Not too much in the way of lacing. Slight lemony smell. Maybe a little bit of a yeasty smell as well. Taste is spicy and citrusy...just as you would expect. A slight bready yeast flavor in there as well. CO2 prickles with the light body being refreshing. Not a bad effort at all for AB. I got it for $6.79 at Food Lion so I guess that isn't a bad price when compared to others. I would buy again."
"EDIT: I did not realize this was an AB product, not bad for them, beats the hell out of Natty."
"This is drinkable, but very mild. If you can get by the clumps of yeast, you may find this to be an innocent wheat beer."
"Mouthfeel is very light with a creamy body from the carbonation. This is an OK beer and a lot better than I thought it would be."
"Appeared a dark yellow with not head or lacing. So there's no complimentary foam and it's too dark. The aroma is of dry, spicy orange. The flavor has that same orange, with bland Belgian-like spice (corriander, pepper). The flavor and aroma aren't bad, certainly not normal for the style, but it's an overall agreeable experience. A real wit has more delicate spices with vanilla and mellow wheat. The body here is also surprisingly heavy, with a sort of medium strength. And the mouthfeel is a bit chaulky. Well... it's better than the vast majority of A-B's beers."
"Got to try this over the weekend, out on the river. Nice, refreshing summertime beer. Poured a hazy-colored gold out of the 12 oz bottle with a wispy, thin head. Aroma was of banana and cloves, maybe berry as well. The taste was pretty good, soft dryness from the wheat with a nice fruity ester taste. Nice beer. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Definitely worth a try."
"I wouldn't want any more than this sample."
"Mouthfeel is actually nice and creamy with that good wheaty quality. Too bad it tastes like an orange soda."
"OH MY GOD! What crap for beer especially trying to pawn itself of as a belgium white! Totally worthless tasted terrible! Bitter aftertaste! Couldn't even finish! Don't waste your money! Sorry Anhauser-Bush just stick to Bud, Bud Light, and Michelob!"
"Overall I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style but does not want to quaff a full strength brew in the middle of a hot Summer day!"
"Overall a servicable wit. Easy enough to drink."
"Wow... this is from AB? This has to be one of the best beers I have had from them. And as far as Hefe's go, this one is interesting and enjoyable!"
"I'd say this is a decent witbier, and a honorable attempt by Anhueser Busch at making a seasonal micro-brew."
"If you want a wheatbeer in this category that is accessible (at least for me they are) and priced similarly to shock top but with a decent complexity try Tucher, Sam Adams seasonal white ale, or Sweetwater's hummer. If you want something more reminiscent of orange soda... go for this. It was more watery than most wheats I've had, has less prominent spice in it, fairly sweet (very little bitterness), and definitely has orange flavor in it. Mouthfeel: way thin despite the fact that it appears unfilitered its fairly watery but with plenty of carbonation."
"Very refreshing."
"Pours a nice cloudy, golden color with a nice head. Smell is a hint of spice and some slight fruitiness. Tasted like regular Bud except unflitered with some spices tossed in and some wheat substituted. Thught it could be drier, but could not get over the Bud taste. Was hoping a better attempt would be made."
"D- Not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to get this but considering who makes it and how easy it is to find its an ok choice."
"A heat-beater for sure. Not bad, but falls short compared to others of the style because of its thinnness."
"Another boring summer brew from Anheuser-Busch. I expected disappointment and I got it. Poured a very cloudy light gold color. Smelled faintly of orange and very little malt. Tasted very thin with barely detectable citrus and hardly the complexity of a good witbier. I just tried this one for the sake of trying it."
"12oz brown bottle from Hannaford. Sounds like last year's Spring Heat Spiced Wheat... Same beer? Let's find out. Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smells faintly orangey-lemony. Tastes like lemon with some orange notes, faint spice and vanilla notes and a very clean finish. Medium bodied with muted carbonation. Very drinkable. Nothing off or displeasing about this beer, but fairly pedestrian and bland as well. In a word, safe."
"Disspointment never breaks hearts, raised hopes do. The appearance brought up my hopes, but the raised expectations from it broke my heart when I tasted it. This is one witbier that might need an orange slice to keep your interest."
"No glass on hand, review from bottle. Citrus notes a little overwhelming on the nose follow through to taste. Something very artificial here, as if they brewed this stuff with powdered tang mix as a dry-hop. Mouth a little watery for a Belgian, would have liked some more carbonation, especially in the finish. That said, I know that this is an A-B effort and not aimed at the BA, but our friends and neighbors. Could this bring more attention to craft brewing? is the real question here; does it's taking shelf space from other crafts, or from Bud light, do the industry justice? Yes and no. Certainly more drinkable than a Bud. Over emphasis on citrus hops, aka the ""9" effect, may turn off a certain demographic. I'm still glad the movement has grown to the point where the big guys are trying to co-opt it with swill like this."
"Overall: Surprised to find this was a A-B product. They stuck to the formula here. Not bad."
"OVERALL- Not bad, really. I didn't expect much, and its easy to drink. Its not impressive, but perhaps that's the point. It doesn't try to be."
"Drinkability: refreshing and light, easy drinking, I can see how this would please the masses"
"D: Well, no matter what, some will hate this because is AB. Truth is, it isn't a bad white. No, it isn't Allagash. But, it is easier to find, and a damned better drink than a Bud/Miller/Coors "" lager ""."
"Gotta follow the pouring instructions on the bottle (down the side of the glass, then swirl the dregs to scour the bottle) else you'll get a short-lived 50/50 head on it. It has a nice cloudy unfiltered color to it, and a fair lacy head, but the color is an odd orange-red, so it looks like a tall glass of orange Gatorade with 7-Up and a splash of milk. The smell is faint, but not what you'd call delicate. Takes some deep breaths to really get it. Smells like someone's making a good wheat beer about a block away. Non-descript citrus comes through in the taste, with a hint of wheat. That's right, a hint of the main ingredient. I like this style to have a bite and crispness like that first can of Pepsi at 6 am, but this lacks even the bite of the Dr. Pepper left over from lunch at 3:30 pm. They didn't use rice to calm it down, did they? If so, it's a shame. There's a pleasant sourness to the aftertaste that would be much better if it showed up in the inital kick, rather than in the lingering metallic sugariness that makes me want to take another drink just to wash it away."
"Overall: This one could pass as a micro, though the A-B ""Born on Date"" gives it away. Still, is a good, fresh White ale a bad thing just because it comes from a macrobrewer? Nay, I say. Taken in and of itself, this one's a decent representation of the style, certainly worth putting back on a warm spring day."
"Kind of a pleasant surprise. The beer was a hazy yellow/orange color with a thick white head. It had a vaguely citrus aroma. Orange and a teeny bit of spice in the taste. Not too bad a beer, but it could have a stronger aroma and taste. Still, it was decent enough to drink that I would order it again."
"Noticed lots of yeasties on the bottle bottom - that surprised me."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this first one washed down my pulled pork easy enough, but I'm not in a hurry to drink the rest of the 6 pack. I would have never bought this, a Witbier from AB, but someone brought it over my house, and I'm glad I gave it a try."
"Had never heard of this before and there is probably a good reason, bartender said I was one of the first people that ordered it after it had been on tap for over a week, one of the weakest witbiers I have ever had, would not drink again, not recommended"
"I had this on tap after noticing an unfamiliar beer I had not tried before in the line-up. The bartender even warned me and asked if I was sure I wanted a pint of this stuff.One of the worst beers on drought I think I have had and thought it was a shame it was taking up space on the lines.Just stick to bluemoon and stay clear of this beer that has already added the orange flavor in it."

" This is not a bad hot-day, mid-summer brew! Easy to drink, flavorful and well balanced but also refreshing. A good beach or pool-side brew."
"A good example of the style."
"Breweries sense the Revolution and they want a piece. There is a place for these intentions and they are not in the boardrooms of advertising & marketing firms. They are in the hearts of the Brew masters who make the beer. Build it and they will come."
"Not too bad though."
"Got home one night and found one of these in my fridge that a buddy had dropped off for me. My take on it was that it was a weak attempt at a belgian wit beer. There was just a hint of the belgian yeast but just lacking any real taste I expect from this style. Maybe on a hot summer day BBQing, but not a one and done beer. This one you could easily drink the six pack in a sitting, and still be waiting for more."
"We tried this mostly to see what AB's answer to Blue Moon was going to be, and no one was impressed. Most people agreed that this was brewed for those who thought Blue Moon was just a little too intense for them, which is kind of a scary thought. It's paler than most Belgian Whites, lacking the spice and mouthfeel that make them distinctive."
"Described to me as Bud's version of Blue Moon, but came off more to me like a Hoeggarden trapped in a nightmare. If Anheuser-Busch wasn't selling enough of their In Heat Summer Wheat, they didn't have to try and fake us out with this shoddy re-branding."
"Pours golden with a one finger plus white head. Very good retention,and a nice lacing.Body is light,and carbonated. Aroma is of sweet fruits,and spices.Nice,but a bit weak. Taste spiced fruit,with a bit of a peppery finish. Not the best version of this style,but far from the worst."
"This isn't a bad beer overall, but I can think of others of this style I'd drink first."
"Overall: Fun for a summer day but not good for much else."
"Also, for the current $2.50 price difference between this and most other 6-packs of wits, this is the one to share with someone that hasn't developed a taste for wheat beers."
"I like it, so does my bud...we'll definately buy it again."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, ok to session with (I don't get easily bored with it). An ok beer. If if is still around in the summer I may give another 6 a go."
"I didn't notice that this was brewed by anheuser-busch until I logged into beeradvocate. I'm glad about that -- I hate most of their other bland offerings, but this is an enjoyable belgian white."
"pours a hazy straw yellow with a one finger white head and a small amount of lace. hints of orange and coriander in the nose. taste is mostly of the orange with hints of lemon and line in the background. mouthfeel light carbonation ok. surprisingly not bad i would buy it again."
"Appears a hazy golden hue with bright white frothy head dwindles at a moderate pace with thin specks of lacing strung evenly around my Hoegaarden glass. Aroma sharp citrus mild sprite flow to it with coriander and really musty yeast notes. I guess they added orange, lime, and citrus peels to the mix all their missing are Clementine and pummelo peels. Flavor is present a bit mellow spice like Chamomile, persistent coriander, citrus notes and more yeasty goodness. A definite solid offering from one of the big three. Looks like a wit, smells like a wit, and tastes like a wit holy shit they can brew to style. Spices to linger for me knocking down drinkability in general but that's typical for the style in my opinion this one just seems extra spiced. Mouthfeel is light bodied spritzy carbonation with a tickling sharp citrus acidity and coriander coating stays with your palate. Drinkability is solid definitely better than the other seasonals these guys attempt to put out there."
"Shock Top Belgian White pours a hazy yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is definitely citrusy if not sour. The flavor is not pleasantl, there may be a touch of coriander, but it's not particularly noticeable. I would like a bit more wheat flavor, and although there should probably be more coriander to be true to style. Had to try it because it was from Anheuser. And like all there other beers I will not be drink it again."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy pale amber color with a lot of yeast left in bottle. Light carbonation and light bodied. Faint wheat nose. Flavor is like lemonade without the citric bite, could be a good summer beer but it doesn't have the hop backbone. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Shock Top Belgian White pours a hazy yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is definitely citrusy. The flavor is also pleasantly citrusy, there may be a touch of coriander, but it's not particularly noticeable. I would like a bit more wheat flavor, and although there should probably be more coriander to be true to style, I don't mind. Pleasant, easy to drink."
"The drinkability is ok, very cool looking bottle to be sure but the beer as a whole is worth a try but not some thing I would look for. MK"
"Verdict: I actually like this witbier. It's smooth, decent and interesting introduction to the style. I will give A-B credit for this one."
"Smells spicy and refreshing in the bottle, like a belgian should. I have to admit the A-B scared me alot after the Landshark disguise but hey, its belgian. Pours to a cloudy bright yellow with an actual fizz on the head. Looks like a wheat and tastes like a wheat. The carbonation is way too high (evident by the fizziness) but with that aside the flavor is not bad. It is difficult to get all the flavors through the high carbonation, but there is a wheat malt start and a nice spicy hop middle with a sweet malt finish. This is probably a good starter beer for the macro crowd to get into the craft beer scene. I'm tempted to let a bottle get a little flatter in the frig to check the real flavor. Good effort, for the crowd, should please."
"It poured bright orange/yellowish with little head. Smelled citrusy sweet as I expected. The taste was not bad, a bit of an orange flavor even without the orange slice (I always opt out of it, it just gets in the way IMO). The beer didn't amaze me or anything, but I will most likely order it again sometime. However, I won't be rushin out to the store to buy up a sixer. One at a time is enough."
"Being a fan of Blue Moon as a summer session beer I bought a 6 pack at my local Kroger. Orange/yellow with a small white head. It smells sweet and tastes pretty good. The spices are little different than Blue Moon. It feels a little watery when drinking but finishes very smooth. I will consider this as a session beer. Not something I will go out of my way to buy but would definetly consider a few while grilling some food."
"I saw this at my hotel bar. The bar tender knew nothing about it, but I thought I would give it a try anyway. This is really not a bad beer by AB. Nothing over the top, but every bit as good as Blue Moon."
"D - Quite drinkable - good American Wit. I would have another, but would not go out of my way for one, nor buy an entire six pack."
"D: A sweet citrusy and refreshing summer time drink and a decent attempt by A-B. a touch to sweet to drink in multiples but much better then coor's blue moon in my opinion."
"Poured a very cloudy yellow color with decent white head that lasted for a while. Flavor is citrusy and the flavor is as well. Pretty smooth drinking beer that is decent for an Anheuser-Busch product. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is pretty high. Not the best example of a Belgian witbier but not bad."
"Overall an easy drinking beer, probably not my first choice but enjoyable.."
"I tried this beer at a Gasparilla party yesterday, it was the first of what would be many beers throughout the day. I was skeptical since it is a Busch product but I was a bit taken by the funky label. It features an orange slice with sunglasses and a wheat mohawk. It's silly but amusing. Anyways my first impression of this beer was that is wasn't too bad. It has a very strong orange flavor, and a wheat-y bread taste underneath. The mouthfeel is very thin but my friends and I thought it was fairly refreshing. We didn't care for it as much as Blue Moon but it seemed to be a decent attempt by Busch. However, after two of these we all felt a little nauseous and switched over to Wittekerke. So the verdict is that the taste isn't terrible but too sickeningly orange to be drinkable."
"Similar to that of Blue Moon, but with a better combination of spices, but with the same malt problems as their Rocky Mountain competetor. This beer opens with a pleasant orange / copper looking hue and solid protein haze from the wheat. Although the wheat malt proves soft and bready, the pilner malt character was very timid. Where you expect to find a rich, bready, dough maltiness, this beer gives as astringent grainy texture and taste. A little more acidic than expected with less phenols and esters; subsituted with a spiciness that, although is pleasant, falls a little flat and less complex than prefered. This will be a nice summertime refresher, but the true beer enthusiest will go for a Hoegaarden or Blanch de Chambly."
"All things considered, this is by far the best brew A-B has ever put out. Celebrate from the Michelob line was close. It's a good beer in a style that would fit one of A-B's usual drinkers that might want to branch out a little bit from the more familiar lager & light lager styles."
"The beer pours a hazy, pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a refreshingly light pale and wheat malt scent along with just a touch of orange peel and coriander. The taste is decent. It has an easy drinking witbier taste that incredibly smooth. It light and conservative. There is a nice citrus element to it. The spices are hard to detect. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable wit. Not too shabby for an AB interpretation."
"supposedly the year round offering alter ego of the ""spring heat spiced wheat"" spring seasonal from A-B. i'll have to check my reviews of that to see if my scores match up."
"Goes down good, never could drink more than 3 or 4 though. but all in all, good stuff"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a creamy white head that possesses pretty good retention and lacing qualities. The aroma is wheat and citrus with some spices and yeast. The taste is wheat with some spices and yeast but is watered down a bit which is a letdown after the promising smell. Overall, this is a decent witbier that is about middle of the pack. I will take this over a Blue Moon any day, so A-B did complete what they were trying to accomplish in that respect."
"Definitely inferior to Blue Moon (does smell nice though)."
"Overall, i am not a big fan of the style, and this one did not change me over. But if faced between this and blue moon, i think i would choose this as it seems after changing the name, and i guess making it a year rounder, this one will try to compete against blue moon. I'm on the edge of me seat to see what happens between the two (que sarcasm). But not bad."
"D - Not offensive in any way, but not all that great either."
"From what I understand, this is a relatively new offering from the mega-giant Anheuser-Busch company... Copped this singly from Total Wine and More in West Orange -first time I have ever seen this brew... ""Born-on-date"" on bottleneck reads Oct.27,2007... Was very disappointed by this macro-rendition of a water-down, pale, weak witbier... beer pours cloudy orange / yellow with no head... smell was very bland for this style, with none of the obvious orange, citrus or coriander coming through... taste was also sub-par, not much flavor going on here... weak in comparison to many other examples of the same genre... mouthfeel was decent, although a little watery and bland, and although this was easily drinkable, it definitely wouldn't be my one and only for the nite... Much better examples out there... not recommended..."
"i'm definetly glad to see this beer back, i think its a pretty good beer to get for like 6 bucks a sixer, its a good deal."
"Edit: I thought I'd try another bottle right after the first and I *did* notice some spice this time but it didn't help too much with my overall rating for it.(taste went from 2.5 to 3.0)"
"An OK Belgian style wheat beer but I think I would go for the Blue Moon over this. No artificial flavors but not so great as the competition."
"Had this after the brewery tour of the Anheuser-Bush brewery in St. Louis. Looks and tastes a lot of Blue Moon in flavor but the color is a little lighter. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a nice head which would probably been bigger if it had been poured into a weizen glass instead of the 9 oz sampler. Smelled of orange and corriander. Taste was citrusy with spicy, peppery notes. Mouthfeel was good. I liked this better than Blue Moon because the spices really came through (probably because it was so fresh)."
"Noticed this on tap at some random TexMex place when I visited Houston last week. Could tell it was a AB product by the type of tap handle - those cartoonish ""what is that brewery?"" type that becomes more obvious when all the other taps are domestics. It's not Hoegaarden, but can but up a fight for a refreshing, quenching, Belgian wit. A bit on the yellow side, lots of carbonation, some spices and citrus character. Not bad."
"I tried this on the AB brewery tour this past Sunday. Reminds me a lot of Blue Moon in flavor but the color is a little lighter. Pours a nice hazy yellow with a one finger head. This was in a 9 oz. taster so, the head could have been bigger if poured in to a pilsner or weizen glass. Smelled of orange and corriander. Taste was citrus with spicy notes. Mouthfeel was good. Has a smooth drinkability. Not better than Blue Moon, but good."
"D - Decent. I remember trying the spiced wheat on tap and having the same reaction. It's not bad at all, but not really my thing. Might be interesting to do a taste off with Blue Moon. If you're caught between this and Bud, take this, otherwise, it's simply take it or leave it."
