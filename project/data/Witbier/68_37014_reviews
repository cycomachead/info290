"Overall – A rather decent and refreshingly balanced wit.  Rather well done and an easy drinker at only 4.8 %."
""
"M - Quite a high carbonation level, with a sharp, crisp finish."
""
""
"06/27/12 Very well balanced taste with a reasonable body. May prove a wee bit heavy, texture-wise,  for the long haul, but if you want a kick starter for a non-school night you could do worse than to start here. I'll be back!"

"White foamy head, some lacing around the top of the glass.  Hazy, pale yellow in color.  Very light aroma of coriander and the orange peel.  Taste is somewhat underwhelming compared to the smell of the coriander and oranges.  Crisp, light on the palette.  Really nice in the summer as it is very drinkable.  High carbonation, nice mouth feel.  Dry and grainy,  Finishes nicely with a tad of bitterness."

"O: I like this one, but I think there's slightly too much citrus. I wouldn't recommend adding any additional slices of orange or lemon. Still a great beer."
"BBD 232/14. Pours a pale yellow with a very slight haze. Massive head with excellent lacing and retention. Very nice Belgian nose of coriander, orange and yeast with a slight pepper note. Light medium body with a smooth texture that has some creamy feel to it as well. Slightly above normal carbonation that yields a nice effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. The flavors of the nose are all present, with coriander and orange being most prevalent. The finish is crisp with just a touch of pepper underlying the coriander. While not as flavor intensive as Allagash White, this one is still outstanding."
""
""
"D - Not a bad Witbier by any means, but not one of my first (or second) options either... The best adjective I can come up with overall is pedestrian... Average at best in most categories... The mouthfeel distracts a bit as its slightly off putting... However, this one will serve it's purpose on a hot summer's day..."

"This is a very pale, moderately clear beer. The head is enormous and brilliantly white. I expected a little more haze in the brew. The smell is typical of the style. Sweet and fruity, with lots of citrus and light herb scents. The smell is a little malty, notably sweet, and it has a slightly spice and earth flavor. Almost no bitterness of hop presence in the taste. Very light in body. It's a refreshing and nice summer brew, but is overall fairly average for the style."

"O- Sessionable and flavorful but it doesn't stand out in the sea of witbiers on the market."
""
""
""
"Great soft wheat flavors that create a base for a spicy witbier. Eggy body transfers energy perfectly in the mouth. A solid peppery bite upfront with the flavors of coriander in the finish. Middle is jammed with witte yeast elegance, orange peel, lemon, and slight grassiness. Really, on-point, especially in the mouthfeel."

"Cheers & Peace2All."
"O: There are a couple of things to fix (mainly feel with a decrease in carbonation) but overall this was a lot better than I expected and a solid beer in the aroma and flavor departments. Good but not quite great job by FD."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The sediment turned me off right away. To be honest it had a decent flavor but I had to dump this one.. maybe next time."

"Overall: I love Belgian Witbiers in the summer, and this is a good one. I drank up my six-pack fairly quickly and would definitely buy it again. Nicely done."
""
"Chugged the last few mouthfuls, and got that refreshed feeling again. Maybe this is one of those beers that is best slammed by the six pack on a hot day after working outdoors. Doubt it would give much pleasure at all if the outside temp was below 70f"

"3.75 D: Seems like most breweries who make a witbier make it well and this is no exception."
""
""
""

"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a decent beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad witbier. I find a lot of witbiers to be way too light, but not this one. Not a ton going on flavorwise, but it still tasted pretty good. Won't rush out to buy again, but it's a solid, crisp, and refreeshing beer."
""
""
""
""
"O-it looked good and smelled good. It tasted bad and felt bad. Tastes adjunct or amateur or something. Just a large amount of off flavor. Not an easy drinker. Won't get again."
""
""
""
"MF - A refreshing, light bodies beer. Carbonation very evident on the tongue."

"Overall - One of the better wits I can remember having. Not quite on the level of Allagash White, but it's a force all it's own. Will have to try again at some point down the road... maybe for a witbier side by side competition?"
"Pours a murky yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some subdued spice aromas. Taste is much the same with muted fruity, citrus flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that still tastes fine even being almost 6 months past the best before date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At 4.8% ABV, you could drink these suckers all day and be fine. Seems like a good one to drink on a really hot summer day. Other than that, there isn't much to it. Not bad, but nothing too special, either."
""
""
""
""
"D- Aside from the weird off flavor it wouldn't be bad, just far from exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly large white head that dissipates quickly on a cloudy dull golden body. Aroma of corriander, Belgian yeast, orange peel and powder sugar. Flavor is pretty mild and a bit watery with more corriander, yeast and hint of lemon and orange citrus. Light body and moderate to high carbonation. The look and aroma make this one promising but it was a little too watery and under flavored even for the style. But, not terrible."

"Not a standout but this witbier is solid for the style. I could see this as a go-to summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All that needs to be said about Woody Creek has been laid out above. It's a neat looking, zestfully aromatic, ridiculously agreeable beer that's layered with a smorgasbord of tastes and textures. And given the price point, we can add ""affordable"" to that list of 'pros' too. As for the 'cons', my only one is that this was the only bottle in the house."
""
""
""
""
""
"Would go well with a light lunch of salads, cheese and bread on a hot day."
""
""
"O: The beer is really refreshing if not uncomplicated. I wish there was a little more to it but then it wouldn't be as refreshing. All in all a good beer but one I won't get again"
""
""
""
""
""
"It poured a clouded pale straw yellow with another lackluster head performance, no lacing. But it smells of coriander and chamomile tea over pale malts (both American and Belgian). Tastes of those malts with a healthy dose of orange peel sharpness and just a little pinch of bitter at the finish. Light fluffy mouthfeel...not bad overall."
""
"This was a textbook Witbier in my opinion. I would say that DFH Namaste is probably a good comparison here. I've had others that were very similar, but the level of quality is probably what sets this beer apart from the others."
""
"The body is light and easy. The taste is vibrant with sweet malts, spice, coriander, citrus, and a clean crisp hop finale. This is a fine rendition of the classic White style."
""
"Overall kind of run of the mill for a witbier, not so much doing it for me, but nothing horrific either."
""
""
""
"highly carbonated body. Faint banana and bubble gum flavors with bready malts, a touch of tropical fruit and a spicy dry finish. Not deeply complex or overpowering but good flavors with good drinkability. Not nearly the best or anything out of the ordinary but much better than flying dogs in heat wheat . Crisp cool and refreshing. Not bad."
"O = A pretty decent example of a Belgium Wit Bier. I'll pick up some more of these for a bbq later in the week."

"Overall: aside from a bit of harshness in the flavor, I like this beer a lot. I would definitely have it again."
""
"Pours a murky straw yellow color with a fluffy thick white head. It smells of banana clove, grass and wheat. The taste is nice and lemony, it's very refreshing with grassy hop tones, banana and wheat. The beer is light with lots of carbonation and a slightly dry finish. This is a solid wheat beer, nothing spectacular but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- ok Witbier but so many others that are better this one is drinkable and refreshing just not remarkable but worth a try"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a pale, hazy, unfiltered yellow coloring with a thick, frothy, chunky, clean white head. Aromas spill forth as you pour, with a strong clove spicing amongst some bready and nutmeg characteristics. FLavors are light and crisp, with a spicing that enhances the toasted grain and bready backbone without overpowering it. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove combine to give a roasted, baked bread type flavor profile in mouth, while remaining light with citrus highlights. The aftertaste is a light spice and roasting, which is well balanced and pleasant. Smooth finish with a crisp bite at the end. Tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
"overall the beer has decent flavors but its closer to a hefe then a wit"
""
"This is a great beer. Looking forward to having it again."
""
"O: Good for the style - it's light, pretty refreshing; a nice curveball from the usual wheats or hefes that I tend towards in this (broad) style area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Have to agree with the brothers on this one - it's one of the best US made witbiers on the market."
""
""
"This beer is to style, it's enjoyable, and light. This is one you can drink for a while at any time. Honestly, though, unless I was looking for this style I wouldn't buy this again."

"No matter what the haters may say, I do enjoy me some Ralph Steadman labels. The beer behind this label pours a lightly hazy pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly musty wheat, light coriander, and a twist of lemon. The taste comprises coriander, light wheat, lemon zest, cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little wit, but nothing close to anything to write home about."

"Golden-yellow in color, hazy, with a small layer of white head. Bready aroma, spicy, with obvious citrus notes. Taste was bready and yeasty, with lemon and orange peel, peppery spice, some banana esters coming through. Pretty typical of the style all over. Light-medium body, and fairly drinkable, though not always what I'm in the mood for."
"Overall: A very good witbier, in my opinion. I've had it at room temperature and cold, and in the former case, I noticed a touch more spice of some kind --- but it didn't diminish the flavor at all."
"12oz bottle, pours a cloudy, straw color, with a tall, foamy white head that holds excellent retention.  Nice aroma of wheat, Belgian yeast, coriander, faint nuttiness. The orange rind is more noticeable in the flavor, with wheat, coriander, yeast, and a bit nutty as well. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy.  Overall, nice Belgian Wit."
""
""
"Light-bodied with good carbonation. Not bad, but one-dimensional and pretty boring. Recommended for a one time try...I've certainly had better wheat beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is crisp and sharp, with a spicy citrus vibe being most prominent. A light and easily-sessioned brew for fans of Blue Moon or Leffe. Very good."
"O: In the end, this is an excellent witbier that can stand toe-to-toe with its Belgian counterparts. It's especially welcome if you enjoy your wits on the spicy side. If not, you may find it to be a little much."
"Enjoyed from a bottle on a sun drenched 4th of July BBQ. Drank this beverage in a tasting with Ommegang Witte and Blue Moon. This beer was very close to Ommegang, exhibiting freshness and impressive quality. Yellow in appearance, Flying Dog succeeds again with this microbrew effort. Typical for a witbier though definitely as fresh as they come with citrus, banana, spices and other predictable flavors coming forth. Well done Flying Dog!"
"A little out of balance and overly spiced, but overall an easy, light, refreshing beer."
"Overall a very drinkable Witbier with a nice strong residual wheat flavor."
"This pours a hazy light yellow / straw color with a nice very large white foamy head. The smell is of herbs and spices, clove and coriander with a malty wheat. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, there are the spices, the clove and coriander along with a sweet malty flavor."
"Over all a good beer but not the best in the style. It is possibly the best looking Wit I have ever had though."
"Overall: A fairly good version of a wheat beer. Could of been a little more assertive with the flavors but whats there is pretty good. Very good use of coriander."
"Overall though, Woody Creek White just comes up a little short. It seems like the brewers at Flying Dog were on the right track, but they just didn't follow through all the way, and the resulting beer is a little thin."
"Overall it was pretty mellow and smooth, a good wit beer that's light, refreshing, and very easy to drink."
"O- Another solid brew by Flying Dog. I'd definitely pick this up to take to a summer party, or to offer craft and non-craft drinkers. It's not a standout, but recommended."
"O: great seasonal that I haven't in the past paid attention to as much as I will now. Once you have had a chance to enjoy this on a warm day relaxing instead of out of the bottle while grilling/eating/swimming you can gain a new appreciation for it."
"D: This beer drinks quite nicely and is very quenching on this 90 degree day."
"Overall an excellent wit, and I'm glad I got a 6 pack stocked in my fridge."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, dry bananas. In the taste, dry bananas and nice spice hints. A small spice bite and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry banana like aftertaste. Nice dry presence and quite easy and enjoyable."
"Overall – I found the taste of this beer to be a little subdued. I guess that makes it more drinkable, but I still would have liked a little more flavour punch. That being said, the taste that it does have is pretty good."
"Overall: A better-than-average witbier and one of Flying Dog's better beers. To me, Flying Dog's regular lineup is nothing short of terrible. However, their seasonals and stand-alone beers (Raging Bitch comes to mind here) have been impressive. This is one is definitely worth a shot if you can find it and is a decent summer seasonal."
"O: I like this beer. Recommended; would drink again. I had low expectations, and maybe that helped. REALLY drinkable."
"I'd rank this one somewhere higher than Hoegaarden and lower than Allagash White. This has a very promising smell, but the taste doesn't quite follow through with the kind of complexity and balance that the best Belgian whites deliver. Carbonation possibly slightly excessive. Predominant tastes are light citrus/malt and corn, and the corn lingers a bit on the palate. This is a passingly good representative of the style, but it's not special enough for me to seek it out again."
"Lemon zest and a slight summery tartness compliment a solid wheat flavor. The tartness is a little hidden, but so important to the whole character of this beer. That tartness makes it unique, finishing dry and clean and oh-so-refreshing. The wheat malt of this one is subtle and in the background, allowing the lemon flavor to flourish. I'm pretty impressed with the complexity of this beer on top of optimum refreshment. Flying dog does some things superbly well, like this beer."
"Coriander like crazy in the nose almost to the point where I coughed. The taste is very sappy with tons of coriander. The flavor reminds me of the smell of a hot summer day."
"This Witbier pours out as a hazy yellow color the head a a bit foamy. The smell of the beer has a light floral wheat aroma with some spice in there too. The taste wasn't the most flavorful wit out there. I found that flavors in this brew fell short of my expectations here. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a decent carbonation. I would try this one again and see if I feel differently about it."
"Pours a nice hazy straw color with an one to one and a half finger stark white tight head. The color has some visable yeast. The smell is of lemons, corriander, anise, and some yeasty sweetness to it. A nice subtle inviting aroma. The taste has a lemon and wheat taste up front with some yeasty sweetness to it and the end and the backend. There is a very slight hop presence at the end to balance out the beer. The taste is average, not the best but not the worst. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and very carbonated. Overall you could drink a couple of these, there is nothing there to push you away, but not even flavor to have you begging for more."
"A better brew than I expected. While cloudy enough to present ""Double Shine"" it lacked the transparency that gives the elegance I usually associate with this one in the glass. Yeast was dark and chunky. No lace. Aromas of wheat malt, dry cereal grains and faint lemons. An appealing yeast fruitiness. Taste is light, very dry and refreshingly clean. Wheat malt is the unabashed signature with a yeast that is an excellent counter to the malt. It brings a clean dry sourness while adding a light lemon note that develops the wheat twang. Bitterness is low but the dryness fills in the gap nicely. Light refreshing feel along with the dry finish makes this a perfect thirst quencher, lawn and grill companion. Goes down quickly and easily so drinkability is no problem. A really nice American brewing of a difficult style. Thanks Flying Dog!"
"M - zippy in the mouth, Mucho bubbly but I like it. Light with High drinkability"
"Ok effort, there is a nice subtle tartness from the wheat and orange perhaps. More wheat centric and fairly clean compared to other wits."
"O: Not exactly a traditional witbier, but it has enough good flavors to be enjoyable."
"Overall- I'm not a huge fan of Witbiers/Wheats/Hefes but I have to say that for this style Flying Dog made a very nice one. Unique compared to other beers in their lineup so don't judge this beer based on other FD's."
"Overall: I am surprised this does not get more love. Of the witbiers I've had, I think this is my favorite only behind Allagash White and its a lot cheaper. Its very flavorful, so if you like your witbier flavors strong, go for this one. It does this without overdoing it. One of the better Flying Dog beers and I wholeheartedly recommend. Cheers!"
"Well, maybe witbiers just aren't the thing for some BAs, but I can't figure out a B overall."
"Beer is thin and super super dry. This is the driest beer I've ever drank. It's a little grainy, corriander and some orange peel on the midpalate, super dry finish. Decent wit."
"Three quarter inch fizzy white head, hazy pale gold body. Head quickly dissipates with very little lacing. Refreshing citrus aroma. Initial bitter taste with a hint of toasted bread. A little more hops in the finish than expected. Light, oily mouthfeel, fizzy carbonation. Very tasty, I could drink a few of these."
"This beer was very straight-forward in nearly all aspects and really did not stand out to me at all. The mouthfeel helps this beer's drinkability but the lack of complexity and the weakness of the flavor doesn't really help my disinterest in this beer."
"D: Eh. Not a bad wit, but not a standout either."
"overall a very solid little beer. i could see myself drinking this without any issue at all."
"D - Another fairly average beer from Flying Dog, the wit doesn't offer up excitement or refreshment leaving it pretty lack-luster."
"Served from bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with sediment at the bottom with a half finger white head that subsides to a minimal amount fairly quickly. Maintains decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt and fermented bananas. The flavor is of sweet malt, wheat, and subtle fruit. It has a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this is a decent brew. Not awe-inspiring by any means, but decent. Aroma is little worse off than the flavor. Just something about the fermented banana smell puts me off. Just glad that it doesn't show up in the flavor."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the coriander with a little bit of orange peel. The flavor is a more balanced mix of orange and coriander - about what you expect in a witbier. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"After pouring the beer I noticed things floating around, im assuming their yeast. There isnt much aroma here. They say they use orange peel and coriander but im not picking up any. Smells like bananas and tastes like bananas, with a hint of wheat and oats. The mouthfeel is right for a Belgian Wit, but the drinkability isnt great. It doesnt taste terrible, but there are a lot of things missing from what I have had with Belgian Wits. Unless this is true to style from Belgium."
"Flying Dog Woody Creek White is a Belgian-style wheat that is good, better than the Blue Moons and Shock Tops, but it is lacking the aromatics and flavor that the best examples have. There is a little clove and banana, but not much else. The wheat flavor and acidity is missing. The pale straw color and the head were promising, but the smell and taste were pleasant but nothing made my tongue call out for more."
"Very drinkable...I could drink this stuff all night."
"drinkability: Enjoyed but wasn't running for the next. If there's any downside to having been exposed to Founders, DFH, Avery etc. it's the appreciation bar is significantly raised."
"Even though the traditional orange and coriander tastes here are somewhat muted, I still am a fan of this beer because it's highly refreshing on the finish, and I love the wheat that sticks around. It isn't my top wit, but it's worthy."
"Overall this was far from an exceptional beer but it wasn't all that bad either. I initially had it rated higher thinking it was an American Wheat but as a Wit it doesn't cut it as much. Not worth seeking out but if it pops up it's worth a shot."
"solid overall and above average but not really outstanding."
"A run of the mill, but still quite good, Belgian Style Witbier. Would be great on a hot summer day at the beach."
"Have been enjoying this the last two summers, finally got around to reviewing it. Pours nice orange-ish with two fingers of lace. Strong hint of orange and coriander. Good mouth, a bit almost chewy (which isn't a bad thing with this variety). Very drinkable, particularly during summer months. Good marks for Flying Dog on this one, plus, I love Hunter S. and Ralph Steadman's artwork is off the hook..."
"This finnishes with a waxy slight bubblegum flavor. It sounds off but it really works with this beer. I'd have more."
"this is a pretty decent beer. i dont know why, but i wasnt expecting much and this surprised me a little. i would buy this again."
"Taste-Coriander, clove, citrus zest. very refreshing and drinkable, would make an excellent hot weather session brew."
"Incredibly let down by the look and aroma. Sisappointed in the flavor as well. Not a terrible beer but I would pass this up for the many superior versions of the style."
"Pours with a little head which dissipates within four seconds. Light lacing around the glass that slides back to the white ring almost immediately. Light smell of hops but nothing to write home about. IBU on bottle 18, but drinks more around a 10. Color is a 4 on the SRM chart. Very clean transparency with very small carbonation bubbles. Does have a pleasing aftertaste of hops that clings to the back of my upper palette and through my nose. Not a beer for which I would spend much money, but I would not turn it down if someone offered it to me."
"This one is fine on the drinkability meter - nothing offensive, and pretty darn refreshing. Just didn't have all the elements of a good Witbier."
"My initial reaction is that this is an easy drinking brew. I think Flying Dog does a great job at recreating this Belgian style of beer. Perfect for a hot August day like today."
"Pours a hazy yellowish that has a small white head that doesnt stay long. Some lacing. The aroma is strong of yeast, lemon, and spices, as is the taste. Light mouthfeel and a beer that is a pleasure to drink. Not a huge flying dog fan but this is an all around solid witbier."
"M/D: Crisp and dry, carbonation is a little fizzy. Finish is astringent. Pretty disappointing, not up to par with other Flying Dog brews I've had."
"So, this basically sucks. It's Flying Dog's Summer ale and apparently it was made for people who don't like beer. Pours a pale yet hazy yellow, kind of like sunshine in the state of Maryland where this is brewed. Very little head, but what there is is persistent, leaving no lace however. Smell is refreshing but faint. Obvious hints of coriander to give it that Beglian ""spiciness"". It fails, however. Flavor is super-thin - almost lemonade like. It's clean and tangy, like a white should be, but it immediately finishes off, almost water-like, and has no length to the finish at all. This is what I'd imagine a hard lemonade would taste like, but without the good parts of the lemonade. Very poor effort all in all. However, at $8.99 a sixer, you can spare the change on occasion if you have friends who aren't beer drinkers."
"I would buy this again, as everything from Flying Dog seems to be safe for a repeat, but I am a little disappointed. I like a more German wheat beer taste, or something more powerful than this non-offensive light beer."
"Very easy drinking Belgian clone."
"Drinkability: Definitely a good summer beer, but also flavorful. I found the other beers I've had from flying dog rather disappointing, but this one is probably the best I've had from them."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and thirst quenching. I would definitely consider this to be sessionable on a hot summer day."
"Pours a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, slight bananna, coriander. The taste is malty/yeasty, bready, with some bananna/coriander notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew on a hot day."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy, hazy medium golden color, capped off with a decent white head. Aromas of coriander, Belgian spices, spicy yeast and wheat. Mildly tart on the palate, with a little citrus, spicy yeast and wheat. Pretty good balance, creamy mouthfeel and quite drinkable. Nice for the hot summer ahead."
"A nice example of the style, but it's just another in the long line of spring/summer Wit seasonals."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus and spices. Taste is mild, citrus and spice, less flavorful than other witbier's. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this makes for a quality beer."
"D: This is a perfect summer beer. It's light, goes down easy and has nice complexity to boot. One of Flying Dog's better offerings."
"Overall: A solid showing from Flying Dog. Nice aroma that matches enhances the citrus taste. The spice is present, but not overwhelming."
"Light bodied and so easy to drink. A great offering from Flying Dog."
"The feel of this beer is light to medium with a easy drinking body to it. It goes down well and is low in ABV so does not kick harder than expected. A nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, zesty, and carbonated nicely with a spiced bit of yeasty dryness pulling through in the finish."
"D-OK, but seems to be lacking something to me. It has the flavour profile that it should but there simply seems to be something missing. This is certainly not a go to Wit for me."
"D - Well I only seen this a 3 Sons as a seasonal but I may buy this again as forum of a new placement for the ""tire dog"" in the variety pack yet we all know they are never perfect..."
"Pours deep golden and cloudy with a very thick foamy head that hangs around all the way to the end. Smells of lemon and grass with a little bit of vegetable. Tastes about the same, grassy with hints of lemon, some spices, vanilla and a little caramel. Nicely balanced. Lighter and crisper than I thought it might be. Blue Moon was the only other Wit that I have had and I didn't care for it at all, so this one was a pleasant surprise."
"D- A good beer. The first one out of the mixed pack I got was clearly bad but the rest have been quite good. I can definitely see drinking this all summer long."
"D: A good beer for the warmer months. Nice alternative to a Hoegaarden."
"Pours clouded smoked straw with a white head that diminishes quickly into a ring. Smell is very pleasant, sweet, with an underlying base of vanilla and fresh citrus. Also some citrus vegetation notes. Taste is highly carbonated, with the coriander doing its part. I'm getting slightly less orange peel. The end is smooth - back to the vanilla malt. Nothing out-of-this-world, but a decent white beer."
"Word to the wise... if you want to try this, just buy 1 12oz bottle to test it... don't waste your $$ on a full 6'er."
"This is actually substantial for such a light beer, and very crisp at the end. Overall this is a pretty good beer. Not as strong flavored as some other wits I've had, but there is certainly nothing offensive here - a very balanced and pleasant beer to drink."
"D) A delicious wit bier. Pour another and I'll tell a friend."
"it's pretty plain for a wit. probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Drinkability: A nice example of a wheat beer. Very refreshing, and easy drinking."
"Still a good domestic Wit and quite drink able."
"M + D: Carbonation has a pleasant shimmer, but is a little on the softer side. This is a bit of a nicer representation of the Belgian styles as compared to many American takes... not so aggressively citrus, which also saves it from tasting too much like a breakfast cereal like Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles. Nice balance, easy drinking, and agreeable flavours make for a nicely done brew."
"I don't see a lot of reason to go into detail for this beer as it's simply a basic Belgian-style witbier, except that it's clear. There's a good deal of coriander flavor to it, and it's pretty dry. I prefer it to the sweeter or fuller versions of the style (Blue Moon), but it just doesn't have the depth of character of the best ones (Hoegaarden, of course). Still, it's nicely done, and pretty drinkable, and I wouldn't turn one down."
"Comes out of the tap a nice clear translucent golden with a fine-bubbled white head. Aroma is wheaty, yeasty and fairly strong with a hint of lemon (though this may have come from the de rigueur lemon slice). Rich, mouth-filling, wheaty flavor is yeasty with a decided undertone of lemon and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is fairly smooth and fizzy. Flying Dog does it again!"
"This beer poured a pale yellow, with a thin head that quickly dissipated and didn't lace well. The smell was very subtle citrus and spice; not exactly as prominent as one would come to expect from a wit. When the time came to taste it, the smell was dead-on, but dare I say dissolved quickly to an unpleasant, almost popcorn-ish finish. It felt light/medium-bodied on the palate, with decent carbonation. Given the bad finish in the taste department, even though the mouthfeel was good I wasn't reaching for another one."
"Drinkability: easy drinking beer which works well on a hot summer day. Worth a try."
"A medium mouthfeel and maybe a touch overcarbonated for my taste, but certainly refreshing."
"I enjoy this brew anytime of the year, it's so drinkable and one of my favorite witbiers."
"Drinks very well, but what wit at 4.8% doesn't? The wheat is flavorful and smooth."
"Verdict: Woody Creek White is a tasty little brew that works well as Flying Dog's Summer refesher. A solid-enough American Witbier."
"D: I really liked it. Very easy to drink; nice and refreshing."
"D: A really nice and inviting witbier. An excellent selection on hot humid days!"
"Cloudy pale brass with a creamy pock marked white head that leaves scraps of lace on the glass. The nose is true to the style, coriander spice, wheat and orange peel. Tart and dry fruitiness up front with an underlying sweet soft banana flavor and plenty of spice. Full bodied and creamy with seltzery carbonation. A nice wit."
"It's one of those beers that's best suited for drinking and less suited for thinking. As soon as I wrote down my thoughts I didn't like it as much. As Crash Davis told Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham, ""Don't think...you can only hurt the ballclub."""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy golden color with tons of rising carbonation. The white head was thin and retained as a layer leaving decent lacing. The aroma was of Belgian yeast, coriander, sweet malt and a hint of dough. The flavors were well balanced and totally on point for the style with the sweet malt and hints of cookie dough up front followed by the floral hops in the middle and the Belgian yeast at the end. The finish was a little yeast-y for me, but I appreciated the flavor arc and distinct notes within. The mouthfeel was good but a little oily, the body medium and the carbonation just touch high. Solid, but not outstanding per se."
"D-I don't have any problems with drinking this, I'm kind of bummed that it is only a seasonal offering."
"D - This is an excellent summer brew with a killer drinkablility factor!"
"When poured into pint glass, the color was a hazy golden yellow, nothing exceptional. Very little foam with some lace retention. Now, the smell of spices and a hint of yeast was getting my interest. What a pleasant aroma. The taste of spices, fruit and other components grabbed my interest. All components put together makes this Witbier fantastic. This could be one of my favorites of all time, so far. Nicely balanced and when all the flavors are put together!"
"This witbier was poured into a pint glass. The foam that orginated at teh beginning of the pouring wisps down to light lacing around the edges. The amber, brown beer gives off the aroma of sweet hops, citrus tones and slight coriander. The taste follows suit but also gives a slight wheat tone as well. Overall a great beer to enjoy during the summer months."
"Sadly the orange helped the head, but little else. This Witbier was flat, and had a nasty lingering bitterness after each swallow. I typically like everything Flying Dog has to offer, but I'll pass on this one. Their ""In Heat Wheat"" is a much friendlier Witbier."
"3.5-4 (now overall) started a bit german but ended belgian. a nice summer ale from flying dog."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy golden color with no head. Very sharp carbonation, a little too much. Very Belgian flavor, with some coriander and other spices to taste. It's a pretty a decent Belgian but it might be better bottle conditioned. I'd look elsewhere for better light belgians."
"One of my favorites for summer weather."
"Very good beer and really hitting the spot right now."
"First and foremost.. this beer is extremely robust for being under 5%abv.. really a welcome surprise while enjoying it.. appearance is an organce-yellow with small white head.. smell is more similar to belgian pales with spicy, phenolic traits and touches of wite-like citrus and such. Flavor is huge with citrust and coriander as well as some belgiany spice. The spice, though, is subtle and doesn't become unpleasant. Mouth is light yet full-bodied. Very refreshing. Again, the spice doesn't override the citrusy characters. Its extremely drinkable, and considering the low abv very sessionable as well. Tastes like a 9% abv beer, drinks like (what it is) an almost-5%."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. Something that would be perfect for summer, or whenever."
"Soft and delicate on the mouth despite a crackle of carbonation on your taste buds. The finish is slightly dry and almost to a chalky stage but maintains with a floral after taste. This beer is quite refreshing especially during those hot summer days."
"Very good compared to most American-brewed Belgian White Ales. Comparable to its Belgian counterparts."
"I found this highly drinkable and recommend it."
"Pretty drinkable beer. I think it's good on a hot summer day."
"My Bro approves."
"D - Solid example of the Witbier style with a slightly more chewy mouthfeel that some others I've had. The sweet and spicy characteristics complement one another quite nicely here."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Very dry and spicey finish. Not the best witbier I've ever had but it is worth a shot."
"D- I could probably drink several without any problem. This seems like a good candidate to drink on a hot day while I'm outside grilling. I think it would be better if it stayed fairly cold."
"This is probably the Wit Bier that got me into the style when I tried it about a year ago. Might be my favorite Wit, but I also give props to Avery White Rascal and Great Lakes Holy Moses. Flying Dog tends to make pretty good beers, but this is one of its most well crafted and sessionable. Highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability: Exceedingly refreshing, one of the better made and most balanced of all the American made Wits."
"This is a nicely done wit. No flaws, not overly spiced and hard to drink like some wits. I would like a little bit more of an interesting characteristic, though."
"One of my favorite summer seasonals, if not the best. I went looking for this today, and found it on my second stop. I want to say I prefer it on draft, but I have not had a draft serving this year yet. Definitely worth a try."
"Notes: A odd variation on the style, but props for originality! This beer reminds me so much of sitting on the white sand beaches of Sarasota, FL, I wish I were back there drinking this beer with my buddy Lenny who first turned me on to Flying Dog at Atlantis Aquariums (bar in SRQ)!"
"Flying Dog - you have really turned your act around. Nicely done!"
"I've had better wits..but this is a solid one among them. Give it a try. Brewery is only an hour away from me so maybe I'll go and try some of this fresh."
"Pale cloudy golden almost milky with yeast sediment. Awesome chunky bright white clouds of heaven form above the rim of my glass what a great looking creating. Fine lacing forms evenly with each sip, quite artsy. Aromatics offer up citrus and banana smoothie infused bread dough with sharp hints of lemon peel and light anise. Flavor goes a bit overboard on the chalky spiced anise kick but edges out enought with citrus and light banana tones to make up for it. Creamy pale malts with light herbal hops bringing in a chammomile like tea experience. Mouthfeel is light bodied with pretty effervescent head, when I popped the cap it let out some bubbly like carbonation. Drinability is solid especially when it's in the 4s as far as abv goes. Spicy yeast gets better with each sip what a nice brew to sip on this summer."
"Relative to the style, there are so many options that are so much better than this, I don't see any reason to keep this around."
"Not a bad beer. Just kind of bland. A good choice for a summer BBQ or a ball game. Which really is all right by me."
"Very good. Could use a bit more of the coriander and orange peel but otherwise, a decent example."
"After first, we felt the spice registered a bit too high, but after a few sips this one grew on us and there was none of the soapy flavor generally associated with overspiced American-brewed Belgian White Ales. Comparable to its Belgian counterparts, and certainly one of the best of its style in the US."
"D: This is my first brew from Flying Dog... I'm ready to try the other stuff they have.... This is a really good wit. Very easy to drink, and could easily drink a few in a night."
"Overall I was a little dissappointed with this beer. I didn't feel that it was really true to style, it tasted more like a hefeweizen. To me it was more heavily carbonated and hopped than most witbiers I have tried. It didn't come across as being very complex either, mostly one or two flavors masked by a bit too much carbonation."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy orangish-amber, with lots of puffy white head, that sticks around for a good while, and leaves lots of lace around the glass. It smells predominantly of banana and spicy cloves, with a bit of sweet citrus in there as well. The taste is sweet spicy cloves, white fruit, coriander, and a little yeast. The carbonation is moderate, but the medium-bodied mouthfeel is somewhat cloying, with an offdry finish. This is quite true to style, and refreshing, but it's not something I'd pursue in a session."
"Drinkability: this is a refreshing wit that's on the dryer side. Flavors are mild and enjoyable. I will seek this out again."
"D: I prefer something with a little stronger flavor, but still a good beer over all. Another great way to introduce newbies to an unfamiliar style.."
"Appearance is good, with a slight head, hazy yellow in color. Doesn't look filtered. Smell is a bit weak, some orange peel and banana. Not sure that the banana belongs here. Taste is pretty similar, put with some peppery flavor added in and coriander. Mouthfeel is decent, light to medium in body and light carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good."
"Pours a typical hazy straw color with almost no head. What little there was disappeared quickly and left no trace on the glass. Some sediments. Smells strongly citric with a lot of spice--think peppered oranges with a dash of coriander. This character defines the taste, but with an underlying, slightly cloying sweetness thrown in. Very spicy, slightly tart finish. Decent mouthfeel; the high carbonation works well for the style. Pretty mediocre, overall."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. I've had most of the Flying Dog brews, and this was probably my least favorite. It didn't have much to offer. The appearance was a lighter gold. Despite an aggressive pour, there was almost no head and no lacing. The beer smelled of oranges and grape fruit and had a few spices. The taste of the beer kinda reminded me of vitamin water. The beer was way to watery, and the citrus taste comes in almost as an after taste. The taste was dominated with oranges, but seemed to have a lemon-lime mix to it. I really didn't feel like having another beer after this one. Honestly, it would probably be best to drink this beer on a warmer day rather than a cold winter night, as I can see this beer being refreshing."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy yellow color ale with a light foamy head with minimal retention and some lacing. Aroma is dominated by loads of ginger notes with some orange peel also discernable. Taste is a mix between some ginger some coriander and some orange peel. Body is way too thin for the style with some average carbonation. A bit more wheat would have benefited and this would have been a great beer."
"Very drinkable. I think the only wit beer I've enjoyed."
"D - Refreshing, clean, tasty."
"Some high quality stuff here. Pours an almost neon yellow, lots of head. Tastes beautiful -- high fruit, citrus, some banana, and not overly carbonated like so many other macro belgian whites. Absolutely great belgian white, recommended to all."
"Typical of Witbier, it has a fruity and spicy aroma and taste. Coriander and grapefruit are present, as well as some spices I can't put my finger on. It blends well and tastes fantastic. Medium body with good balance to the carbonation. Overall, very drinkable and a very tastey brew!"
"D - Aside from the mouthfeel a good beer."
"shrug"
"Overall, the beer has a pretty light flavor and is very refreshing, which i think was the intention."
"Carbonated yet rounded mouthfeel, good texture for this style."
"this beer pours a nice hazy orange gold color with a thick white head that fades to a nice ring of lace. the aroma brings the requisite citrus and spice, and the yeast are doing there thing with the esters. the taste has a decent amount of coriander, pepper, and whatnot, but the fruitiness isn't really there. the mouthfeel is a bit on the crisp side, but pretty darn drinkable."
"A totally drinkable beer, although not the best example of a witbier out there. This is thinner and not as malty as some. But the 4.8% ABV makes it an easy drinker. I won't revisit, but fans of the style should at least give it a try."
"D: This is a smooth drinking brew. I think it would be a great introductory beer to new beer enthusiasts."
"Overall, a very well executed beer. Many breweries don't do subtle well, but Flying Dog shows it skill here."
"D - Great beer. Not the best Witbier i've had but it is really good."
"D - A nice and flavorful Witbier that loses some of its drinkability due to the unfortunately low carbonation. The spice character is balanced and quite nice, especially in the aroma. If this had been properly carbonated it might have been one of the best examples of the style that I have had."
"Overal, this a good witbier from a widely available craft brewer. Refreshing and tasty without being expensive is a good thing for a beer to have."
"D: I really like this wit. I could easily drink a six-pack of this stuff. Good flavours, well balanced, well worth the money."
"Drinkability is good, this is a tasty witbier and a good style from the Flying Dog Brewery of Denver, CO."
"The mouthfeel is lighter but in a good way. Drinkability is high due to the great flavors. A great lighter offering from Flying Dog. A bit more refined than their In Heat Wheat."
" I'm actually very impressed with this version, even if summer is long gone."
"D: Fairly low ABV and decent flavoring make this quite drinkable. Not offensive in any regard, and quite quenching."
"All in all, a very nice example of a witbier, would definitely recommend it to friends and try it again."
"Really smooth & lager like, not yeasty one bit. A very refreshing beer. Clear, smooth, & high carbonation made it seem like a lager, but taste was nice, smooth and refreshing."
"D: While this isnt't my favorite witbier ever, it did have its own charm about it. Definitely a drinkable beer. A good summer beer."
"D- very easy to drink, good beer but not one of the best whites that i've had but very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice and crisp. Drinkability is good. The low alcohol and solid witbier taste make this a winner as a summertime session beer."
"Nothing to complain about on this one. A sure winner. If you enjoy a wit, don't pass this one up."
"Fair witbier,...fairly average."
"This beer definately would not be my first or second choice if I had a good variety of whites to choose from, but its not bad either and if it was available in a store where I could not purchase other whites...Id buy it again."
"Poured a hazy yellow color with a nice white head that stayed for a while. Aroma is citrusy with a bit of spice. Flavor is tangy citrus with a bit of spice to it as well. Mouthfeel and carbonation both seem about right. Low alcohol and easy drinkability of this one make it very sessionable."
"D: Very drinkable and this could be a new session beer."
"Drinkability: I could throw back a few of these things on a hot summer day."
"D: Solid drinkability"
"Pours a murky yellowish orange with a quickly fading white head. Smels of sour grapes, some spice and coriander. Tastes tart and lemony up front with some light fruits and coriander. Light mouth-feel, and a bit chalky. This is a smooth drinker that lacks a bit in the taste department."
"Also, not necessarily the most drinkable of Flying Dog's options, but joins good company of my favorites from this brewery."
"A very smooth beer. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Nicely balanced."
"Very good. Not a style that I'm accustomed too but will be exploring more thanks to this yummy brew."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle, appearance is a pale and cloudy straw-yellow with a thin finger of white fizzy head that slowly dissipated into a moderate ring of lace. Aroma is spicy and sweet with earthy undertones, notes of clove and banana. Taste is malty, spicy and alive with citrus notes, has a ""wheaty"" flavor that falls in and out with the malt and the faintest touch of floral hop notes. Finish is light and dry, a little musty. Mouthfeel is rough given the active carbonation against a light to medium bodied brew. Drinkability is great, aside from the aroma this is the high point for me in this brew given it's low abv% and appreciable characteristics. Makes for a great session Wit, would recommend."
"I've wanted to try this for a while for several reasons. I like witbiers, I like Flying Dog, and I'm wanting to get at least one bottle of everything I can for Steadman's art. They didn't have this in singles, but I just had to have at least one so I bought a six pack for the above reasons. Though I was worried I'd regret it, I will have no problem downing these guys. Great stuff."
"D: Definitely drinkable, one of the better witbiers I've had and will definitely be looking for it again."
"If you don't mind licorice flavor, this beer is way easy to drink. It's not even that it's an overpowering flavor, just that it's there."
"Had the classic wit aroma as well. Really spicy with corriander and bitter orange peel. The taste has a little more bit than the average wit. Almost farmhouse spice. When I grab most wits, I'm looking for something tasty with a smooth finish instead of a bite so this one wouldn't be an everyday wit. But when I want a little more this one would be perfect. Not sure we get it except in the sampler pack which sucks. Overall, a really good wit and I highly recommend."
"Drink ability= It's a very drinkable, and I might want to try it again some time, but its not going to be my first choice."
"A thick and milky feel, with lots of body. Much thicker than a regular wit. Definitely more like a hefe than a wit. A tad misleading but a hearty, drinkable brew. Not very summery though, I must admit."
"pours a murky light gold with a big, frothy white head. great lacing. smells great! citrus, bananas, lemons, coriander, all the great true hefe scents. the taste is delicious! same taste as the smell but also sweet malts, slight yeast, medium bodied, smoothe carbo. Deelish!"
"Average drinkability. Not one of my favorite witbiers."
"D - A very exceptional wit. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable and refreshing nonetheless."
"Im still hit and miss with this brewery but its worth a try."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly to a thin ring, leaving traces of lace. Pale, cloudy amber color. A ton of yeast left in bottom of bottle. Light carbonation and bodied. Orange peel nose. Flavor is as advertised - orange peel, coriander plus yeast. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"D= Very drinkable if you're up for a good Witbier."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on a cloudy yellow body. Smell was ""sharp"" for a wit, kind of caught me off guard a bit. Same deal in the taste. The grapefruit bitterness was a tad high for me, especially for a wit. Wondering if it was too peppery? I'm going to give it another go if I see it, as this is one of my favorite styles from a usually very good brewery. But for now, a bit of a letdown."
"Despite a vigorous pour, not much of a head formed or lasted on this beer, though it does have a nice cloudy yellow gold color. The nose, though, is excellent, very perfumy, with plenty of curacao aroma, spicy coriander, and light wheat. The taste matches the aroma well, with a lot of peppery, spicy coriander backed with a citrus tartness. I think it could use a little more sweetness, as it gets a little harsh near the finish. Still, all the right flavors for a wit are present."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with a medium, white head. Unfiltered. Smells like raw wheat, and citrus peel. Very aromatic. I love the way this beer smells. Taste is light, refreshing, with a strong wheat flavor, slightly tart, with a hint of citrus and Belgian ale yeast. A slight amount of bitterness from the hops rounds things out. Mouthfeel is slightly watery, carbonation very high. Highly drinkable though, a great summer beer."
"Cloudy dull yellow. Lots of bubbly off white froth sits on top. It leaves plenty of lace as I drink as well. Strong aroma. Almost saison like in its lemon and leather smells. Also some evident corriander spicing. Pretty fragrant, but not overly done in my opinion. Taste is very good. Nice malted wheat base with a strong presence of orange and lemon peel as well. Corriander adds some complexity. Very tasty well done Wit. I'll get more if I see it again."
"D: Very drinkable, especially during these warm summer months. Refreshingly perfect for the deck."
"Great drinkability, good carbonation, smooth and refreshing."
"D - Nice full flavor, easy mouthfeel, and low alcohol make this witbier a true session ale. I think I could easily down a sixer of this. Definitely one of my favorites from Flying Dog!!!"
"D- Easy to drink just not my favorite of the style."
"First think I noticed was the Interesting artwork on the label. Pretty psychotic looking but pretty neat. I poured this one into an oversized wine glass producing a small beige white head. It had an opaque golden yellow color and swirls of surface bubbles lingered through the entire experience. Smelled of coriander and tasted similar with a little bitter kick at the beginning followed by wheat ending. Flying dog did a nice job on their take of a wit beer, nothing too extreme just what you would expect for a wit."
"D: Very nice drinkability, refreshing, tart and perfect for the summertime heat. Six pack worthy as you cant go wrong here."
"A really good example of a Belgian Wit, deffiently one of the better American made. Super zesty and refreshing. It matches the classic style very well. A great beer for the dog days of summer."
"I could drink a lot of these. One is doable too though"
"D : Real easy to drink and would be perfect on a hot summer day"
"The complexity of this beer compared to some Belgian Wits I've had is not equal, but this is one American wit I pleasantly enjoyed, will recommend and have again for a better sampling and one I think can hold its head up high."
"M/D: Low carbonation, sweet up front, a bit sour at the rear. Very crisp finish. This is right on the heels of Allagash. I am just in lust with this beer."
"Recommended..."
"I poured this beer into a pilsner glass. It was a hazy yellow/orange color with a thick white head that reminded me of whipped cream. There was some delicate lacing. The aroma was citrus and grain. It had an orange taste, althought there was a late tang of lemon. Some malt also, and a tiny bit of spiciness. I thought this beer was pretty robust for a wit, and really enjoyed it."
"Pours a fully fogged in straw with brown tones. Nice off white head that really shows off a pretty firm pour. Wow to the nose. Total wheat funk-a-delic. Citrusis there, but not overpoweringly so. Flavor is bloody smooth. Just a nice balanced ride of mild citrus over a fairly full, but smooth, body of wit. It gets a 4.5 for being even-keeled, and not for being some insane ride of flavor. And also for the fact that this is an American producer putting out something so well done. Feel is as expected. A bit thinner on the liquid with a nice smooth carbonation. Overall the theme for this ride is ""smooth"". That basically describes most of the aspects of this beer; easily drinkable, and totally sessionable. As I have this, I just imagine sitting on a porch somewhere, cooling myself down as the summer heat tries to ruin my day."
"Prosit, MK"
"A bit light, an easy drinker for sure, summer beer but others are better, including 312."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Gives it a great crisp taste. It's more drinkable than I expected. Overall, it's a decent beer. Worth a try."
"Flying Dog doesn't distribute much around me but I got this sixer from Purv's in Peckville, PA and I hope he continues to bring the ever-increasing likes of Flying Dog, Founders, Hopping Frog, etc. to the area as I would like to become more familiar with them."
"Pours an albino straw hue with pristine clarity before the yeast pour, and an opaque haze after. Thin 1/2 finger shows passable retention but leaves very little lace. Coriander, lemon and wheat in the nose, with generous belgian Wit phenols like band-aid, earthy yeast and banana ester. Sweet wheat and sharp pils malt upfront, followed by a dry and slightly tannic aftertaste that finishes up with tart phenolics and mellow herbal hop flavor. The hop bitterness is appropriatly light with the spice and sharp pils notes balancing the mildly sweet wheat and malt taste. The body is light and the carbonation level is very high, producing an extra crisp and refreshing mouthfeel with a hint of tart Witber phenols and suggestion of apple/banana exter twang. The finish is clean with spice and yeast tones that vanish quickly. American beers of this style seem more numerous than those from its country of origin, but as long as they hold a high drinkability like this without sacrificng flavor, I will say that the USA is the best place to look for Witbier. Cheers to Raul Duke."
"12 oz. glass bottle - color of hazy yellow, with a decent eggshell colored head - nose of honey, ginger, and lemon  taste of citrus, lemon, egg whites, and spice - body is medium, and with low carbonation  aftertaste of lemon, malt , and grapefruit"
"A light golden color, slightly cloudy in the middle, more transparent along the sides of the glass. A white puffy head forms, about two inches high, that slowly dissolves away. A lemony citrus aroma, followed up with the spicy scents, mostly corriander. The spicy fragrance does not overwhelm and blends itself nicely with soft scent of wheat. That light citrus flavor rolls across the palate, bring the spices along with it, as well as the wheat. A slight touch of bitterness at the end. A watery, thin feel, with carbonation growing as it reaches the back of the palate. For a witbier, it succeeds, the citrus and spices are there, refreshing finish, make this a summer time treat."
"I thought I had an outside chance to win the 'name our summer seasonal' contest that Flying Dog ran this past year. Thinking they'd want to continue the dog theme, I suggested names such as 'Tail Wagger', 'Leash Ripper' and 'White Hydrant', among others. I like Woody Creek White though. Both as a name and as a beer."
"It pours a murky yellow with a sparse head. Citrusy to smell, but not in an overpowering way (which is, to me, the tragic downfall of many Belgian wits), and with a briney yeast. Very nice! The taste is similarly subtle and complex without overdoing the citrus. Mellow and fresh. The mouthfeel is rich, yet playful. This is a damn good beer in my book!"
"Drinkability: A bit over-spiced for my tastes. There are better witbiers to be found."
"Pours into the Ommegang Witte tumbler a moderately hazy, golden lemon yellow body with a small, off-white head. Honey-soaked wheat bread peppered with abundant spices (clove, allspice, nutmeg?) and spicy yeast. Lightly toasted grains and soft, yeasty wheat malt. Light fruits and subtle clove and orange peel citrus notes before a yeasty, snappy, refreshing finish. Medium-bodied, pulpy wheat feel with refreshing carbonation. Nice."
"This brew is a hazy pale yellow color with a thin white head that dissipates steadily. Minimal lacing is evident. Pleasant aroma of citrus, yeast and coriander. Light, effervescent body with a mildly hoppy and spicy flavor that has touches or orange and tangerine. The finish is zesty hops with a touch of malt thrown in. Very passable overall."
"It's okay, but when Blue Moon is more of a subdued taste that I'd rather have, even the better ingredients don't save this one for me."
"A clear straw gold with a nice big billowy head. Strong smells make me think Saison. Corriander and Bitter Orange are immediately noticable in the taste - exactly as advertised, kudos. Mouthfeel is smooth, hignly quaffable. Sweetens a bit as it warms, but that is the only detractor - that and the price. 10 dollars a sixer is a bit steep for something so sessionable. Very well done."
"Truly an extraordinary beer."
"The beer is well carbonated and is quite dry tasting up front. It picks up some sweetness as the beer moves across the tongue and this tends to accentuate the orange peel contributed citrus flavors. There is a touch of coriander here in the flavor, though not nearly as much as the aroma would have suggested (this is fine by me, as I like a restrained coriander note in Wits). This is certainly a tasty example of a Wit, but it is a bit too simplistic for me. This pairs fairly well with food, which makes it seem more lemon-like and drier."
"Into a pint glass, pours a cloudy straw yellow, a nice white head with wide stringing lacing, pretty nice. The aroma is pretty stock wit, good Belgian spices of coriander, orange rind, wheat malt, and is similar in the taste, with lemon zest and clove in there. The mouth has fine carbonation, decent body, really there isn't anything wrong with this one, though nothing exceptional."
"Drinkability - I am not a witbier fan, but this is pretty good for the style to me."
"Could drink a lot of these, very light in color and feel"
"What holds this brew back is its thinness of flavor and lack of length. Across the tongue, this really just disappears, and the initial spice and malt flavors turn watery. This is not my favorite Colorado wit nor my favorite Flying Dog brew. Take a pass unless you're a wit fanatic."
"Mildly hazed pale blonde body with a small white head that leaves scant lacing. Subtle aroma of wheat, coriander, white pepper, and reen bananas. Light bodied with zesty carbonation. Taste is lemony citrus, spicy coriander and pepper, wheat, and a hint of orange. Lemony citrus finish. Nicely done and a pleasant summer sipper."
"A very good example, and rare quality, found in American attempts at a Witbier. The beer hits a home run. Very flavorful, but lightly textued, with pepery character, mild hops, and an estery spiciness that finishes very powdery and clean. But there are a few characteristics that keep it from becomming a Hoegaarten. The beer opens with a bright yellow / golden color that falls just short of 'bright', however with ideal head retention and creamy carbonation. Aromas are a characterful blend of wheat malt, clean esters, light citrus fruits, and a fresh peppery qualtity. The scent of Saison begins to make it's way into the beer after warming, with a mild must and earthy scent. Although characterful, may muddle the aromas a bit. Flavors are equally as satisfying as aromas. A bit higher hop rate separates this beer from Belgian counterparts. Picks up on more of a lime / pineapple flavor, rather than the predominant orange flavors that are typical of the style. The body may be a touch high, but does not hurt the drinkability or quality of the brew. Finishes quite clean and powdery-clean, with a solid dryness. Lightly hopped and warming late. Very good beer; it picks up on some earthy, musty characteristics that help the beer as much as it hurts. About as good as an American Wit gets."
"Drinkability: Great. I think this is the equivalent of the beer geeks Bud Light! Light in body but not in flavor. Also a great example of the style."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable despite the rather odd appearance."
"Overall: I generally think American made wits flavors are a bit rigid and don't meld as well as their Belgian counterparts, but this one is much further along than most American versions in that respect. Good appearance, a good balance of flavors, and quite refreshing. One of my favorites from Flying Dog so far."
"Quite an excellent Witbier, if it has a flaw it is maybe a little bright tasting from not be shipped over on a ship. Highly recommended one of the best Flying Dog Beers."
"Aroma contains many of the wit characteristics; corrainder, some citrus, yeast spices and malt. Things are a bit tame here, but nicely blended. Seems like a watery lemonade, but the yeast and hops liven it up. Very easy drinking, albeit a bit thin for my taste. Nice summer brew."
"Flavor is a bit weak all around. Wheat is a tad thin and none of the other spice cabinet flavors I associate with the style. Maybe a slight hint of cinnamon or cloves but I really had to dig for that. Thin mouthfeel that is just a tad watery without any wheaty heft to it. Alright enough for a summer day but not particularly a prime example of the style."
"Overall, a very normal wit. Not as full as a hoegarten, but tastes better crafted than a blue moon. I am not a fan of the style, but i would say this is a good example of one."
"The taste has good lemon flavour with some spice and wheat and there's also some earthiness. It's pretty noticeable and good until just before the finish when it drops off some leaving it on the watery side. Still, this isn't a bad brew and it's a welcome drink for the hot summer day here in Casper."
"This beer pours a clouddy pale whitish-yellow color. The head is one inch in height, fluffy, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of coriander, and wheat with a hint of orange peel, but is rather faint. The taste is vibrant, but light and short lived. Cirtus, coriander, and lemon are all present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice, lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer, but I would rather have a Summit Scandia, or even a Hoegaarden."
"back pretty hard."
"Cloudy lemonade while with a more than respectable head, leaves summer clouds and sticky lace on the inside edge of the glass. Nose is zesty, lemony, and sweet. Flavor is super refreshing, with a sweet powdery texture punctuated at the finish by lemon. Mouthfeel is clean as hell, and absolutely refreshing. Drinkability is very high on this very hot August day in Southern California."
"Poured into my Witte tumbler glass. Picture perfect witbier. Pale straw yellow with a chunky frothy head. Moderately cloudy after swirling the last little bit around to kick up some sludge. It smells like coriander, bitter orange peel, cardboard, yeast, and pale malt. It is light and refreshing with a mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Slight clove with a hint of lemon. Crispy from the carbonation and light hopping. Overall a great beer to serve cold on a swamp ass of a day as this in Rochester, NY."
"Drinkability - this is a very good witbier, and so it's perfectly sessionable, at least in the heat of summer."
"Not authentic, but a pretty nice wit beer. It doesn't have the subtle flavors of a Hoegaarden, but there's a nice spice pepper flavor to start, followed by smooth wheat with a bit of cream. I guess it was a just a touch rough around the edges, but still satisfying on a hot summer day."
"Well, its been a rainy spring here in da 'burgh and this once makes me dream of warm summer days on terr."
"Tastes noble hoppy flavor with some zing and mild bitter. Oranges with mild coriander. Yeasty and doughy. Coriander is drying, but overall malt wet wins out. Finish balanced between malt and a woody dryness. Orange peel keeps fruity character in play and the unexpected hop contribution adds complexity. A quite well done Wit and a drinkable summer quencher. Md-light body with med-heavy carbonation."
"Pours a golden yellow color with decent head, but little retention, and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Cloudy. Initial aroma is a ""sweet wheat"" scent, with some fruitiness. Good carbonation. Hints of lemon and orange in the taste, along with a strong wheat malt taste. Grainy. Has a good amount of carbonation, and a good mouthfeel overall. Light. Overall, definitely a beer to check out (as are most Flying Dog brews)."
"D: Excellent drinkability, very refreshing, a very good and well-made wit by Flying Dog."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a refreshing pale and wheat malt scent along with bitter orange peel and coriander. The Belgian yeast adds a wonderful fruity character. The taste is good. It has a crisp pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a lemony zest and a coriander spice. It's highly refreshing, which I'm sure is the point. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good wit. It's got a great aroma and taste. It's light, fruity, spicey, and highly drinkable. Great job guys."
"A bit thin. Not bad."
"Drinkability- Overall a nice american made wit. Would probably pick up again in the future."
"This beer pours a pale yellow color with a medium head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is yeasty with some citrus and a bit of corriander. The flavor was very common for a witbier. Corriander, yeasty, slightly drying, citrus. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing wrong. Nicely done witbier. Body was light/medium and the drinkability is good."
"D - very refreshing and very drinkable."
"12oz bottle from Florian's. Opaque straw yellow body with a half inch of off-white head. Body looks kind of like milk was mixed in, which is a bit odd, even for the style. Smells spicy, citrusy, and yeasty. Tastes orangey, lemony, and spicy. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Not the best example of the style, but a decent drinkable beer."
"This was a very refreshing and enjoyable wit beer on a scorching hot summer afternoon. Tradition in approach and flavor. Definitely a beer that I'll be visiting again before summer's end."
"Overall, a completely solid witbier. Easy to drink and thirst quenching, and full of flavor.Definitely recommended."
"poured a cloudy straw yellow with a good one inch white head that held well and sheets of lacing down the glass. nose is strong with coriander, clove, pepper, lemongrass. taste, wheat malt, yeast, coiander, pepper, lemongrass, peppery and tangy on the finish. light and smooth mouthfeel and carbonation is good. smell and taste are strong nothing subtle about this beer. great tasting beer from flying dog brewery."
"While you could session this one there are lots of other wit's that are better."
"Pours a cloudy straw color. Fluffy white head with good retention, and, a nice lace. Lots of bubbles. Smell is of lemon,clove,and spice. Body is light,crisp,and carbonated. Taste is of spiced fruit,and candy. Great from start to finish. I plan on having much more of this beer over the summer!"
"Drinkability - Summer grass-cutting beer. Had I not already picked the Harpoon Raspberry Wheat as my summer beer, this one may have been up there. I very much enjoyed the big nose on this one which was a lot of the appeal."
"Great Wit, spicy, herbal, fruity, delicious. Flying Dog turning it around? Will pedestrian micros flavors give way to fantastic crafts and big beers? I am surprised. I have not had a decent Flying Dog other than Gonzo, and Gonzo and this Wit break the boring Colorado trendy big cutesy micro mold."
"A very nice, soft, rounded Wit. I've had better, crisper, sharper, but this was a nice change of pace. Would pair well with a nice Mandarin Orange salad, any whitefish, lemon and/or orange chicken with a little zing, just about any lite warm weather fare. If you like a little roundness in your wheat beers as opposed to a sharper, crisper edge definitely check it out."
"There's nothing here that's horribly unique or bold or exciting or anything like that--just a solid, slightly above average example of its style. A great summer session beer that goes down as smooth as chocolate milk."
"Surprise! I said something good about a Flying Dog beer for a change."
"I'm not the only one that disliked this one. Rochesterinsider.com's June 20, 2007 review stated ""Thumbs down. The smell's unappealing, and there's a soapy taste."""
"Overall, a decent wit. It's more musty and less spicy than most."
"Got one of these in a mix a six at my local place. Pours a cloudy lemonade color, very hazy. smells lemony with yeast and a slight spicy hopness. Tastes is good, but it could of been great, needs a little more spiciness, but still good. mouthfeel is a bit watery not much body to it, but on a hot day like today, i could take plenty of these guys down."
"Drinks really easy, not one of my favorite styles, but they nailed this. I certainally liked this better than NB's organic wit, which I had twice on draft"
"Drinkability: Light and refreshing; a good effort at this style"
"The mouthfeel is full-bodied but not in a creamy sense. More of a starchy, grain-like texture with some carbonation."
"Too much black pepper for me, making it not as smooth as it should be. It hits the style in general, but only mediocre at best, IMO."
"Drinkability- This is one of the smoothest Flying Dog beers I have ever had. I could have this on a hot summer day and it would be a toss up next to Hoegaarden. A fine wit."
"Overall impression: Nice drinkable wit. Not nearly the best Wit out there, but better than average as far as a Flying Dog offering."
