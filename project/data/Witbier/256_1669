3.53,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Hazy pale color with the unfiltered residue sinking to the bottom. It has a quickly receding head that isn't big to start with.  It smells like wheat with a touch of orange at the end, but isn't very strong.  Good balance of citrus and wheat with a little spice kick at the end. Nice crisp, light body with light carbonation. Overall, it isn't complicated or daring and follows through on what it claims to be. A solid wheat I could drink in any weather. Very refreshing and enjoyable.","OKbrew89","Feb 21, 2015"

The nose comprises lemon zest, orange zest, light grapefruit zest (this is one zesty beer, eh?), coriander, confectioner's sugar, a twist of lime, and a few drops of honey. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, coriander, light black pepper, very light lime, light grapefruit, a touch of banana, and a honeydew slice or two. Nice and fruity.

As I poured it into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass, the nice faint orange haze and lively carbonation was a promising start. Little did I know just how quickly things would turn. Very thin, watery. Malts barely surface. Coriander and some ""secret blend"" of herbs? Not detectable on the nose or palate. Lost Coast categorizes this to be a wheat beer, but it goes down like a summer ale gone horribly wrong. The 1.5 mark for drinkability isn't an exaggeration.

The carbonation level was a little rough at first making this ale have a bit more carbonic bite when it is really cold and freshly poured. I prefer this one without fruit and served at a nice 45 degrees or so to let the wheat flavors balance the spices a bit more.

It seems quite citrusy. The taste is good. It has a refreshing dry wheat flavor with a fruity yeast finish. It goes down very easy and finishes a bit tart on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine wit. It has wonderful aroma and flavor; a great summer brew.","WesWes","Mar 06, 2004"
3.7,8.5,3,3,4,4,4,"Very drinkable, this is one of those brews that is good without having one outstanding attribute. This is a brew that gets all the basics right. Best American Wheat Beer I have had yet.","Zorro","Mar 04, 2004"

3.83,12.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Decants a cloudy, pale yelow with a fizzy white head that retreats immediately. The smell is heavily fruity with a surprising hop tang and some citrus that must be the ""natural flavors"" the label alluded to. The taste is very similar to the nose.A slight bitterness shows first, then mellows out into a wholly complex but mild frutiness. Green apples, strawberries and lemons come to mind. Mouthfeel is thin and refreshing with a big blast of carbonation. Drinkability is fine, but would be great in July around midday.","MobBarley","Feb 13, 2004"

3.21,-5.9,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"I don't know, on some levels this beer was appealing and quite drinkable. It made for a decent change of pace. On the other hand, the over-arching perfumey nature of this beer was rather off-putting. Try and reach your own conclusions; as for me, the jury's still out and it's heading for a hung-jury.","Boilermaker88","Nov 13, 2003"

3.8,11.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"22oz. brew bottled in August 2003, Appears a hazy golden with a white short lived head nice webbed even lacing. A pleasant citrusy spiced up wit delivers a smooth slightly bready yeast note through my senses, overall light and spiced up with some tropical fruit like annuances. Tastes, zesty citrusy zeal it with spices and syrupy textured sugar very tasty and dessert like, hold the twist of lemon for me this one's packing enough flavor. Sharp sweet tone from the malted wheat due their duty nice micro brewed wit in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium in body slightly sticky texured very nice high carbonation going on. Drinkability, definitely brings me back to the summertime, just one of those brews desigined for warm weather.","WVbeergeek","Oct 01, 2003"
3.72,9.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,5,"BEWARE!!! This stuff is very drinkable. If your Catholic roots(I'm Irish Catholic, so I can joke) don't make you an alcoholic, this stuff will! The apperance is a cloudy straw color with a very white head. I could see come sediment in the glass, guess it's the yeast, at least I hope it is. the smell is kind of like roasted p-nuts and some wheat. The taste is more wheat than anything, but not too heavy on it. It's well balanced and not all hopped up like some brews of the same genre. The bottom line is that I really like it and will get more than a single next time.","JISurfer","Sep 29, 2003"
3.73,9.4,3.5,3,4,4,4,"As far as American Wit beers made on the West Coast, this one is definitely at the head of the class. The tendency of brewers on the West Coast is to flood Wheat Beers with so much hops that they eventually taste like sierra neveda pale ale. I am not a style maven by any means, but when you try a beer and it tastes like a style that is different than what it claims to be that can be aggrevating. This beer had a great hint of citrus in the aroma and a nice sweet initial taste with a slightly dry finish. I had this in the 22oz variety and it seemed that most of the spices were down in the yeast sediment. It had a smooth mouthfeel and a mildly creamy head. My only complaint is that I did not buy another one to bring with me back to the East Coast -- I'm not sure if you cant get their beers over here.","andyj","Sep 22, 2003"

3.03,-11.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Light gold color, cloudy, medium head. An unfiltered wheat beer flavored with coriander and herbs. A lighter bodied beer, typical of a wheat beer. Taste is a little citrusy. Flavor is mild, not much hop or malt taste; most of the flavor is in the spices. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Aug 22, 2003"

Creamy, with sucrose sweetness, there is a decent lashing of dried, powdery bitterness on the finish. All the same, low-acid to a fault ...seems a little too ""designed"" for my taste.","putnam","Aug 21, 2003"

4.27,25.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I really like this wheat beer. This light unfiltered beer poured a hazy light straw gold in color with no foam. The smell was of a malty aroma with a hint of wheat. The flavor of barley malts, wheat and spice was very well balanced. The combination of malts, wheat and spice with a hint of a spritzy citrus at the end made this wheat beer a pleasant quincher. A nice bitter/sweet/tangy finish. The aroma and taste reminded me of a Belgium Style Ale!","BeerManDan","Jul 13, 2003"
3.43,0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Overall: Far from complex, indeed, simply put, this is just a floral wheat beer with strong citric elements, and a persistent herbal dimension. Still, this is nicely balanced, and a great beer for sinking whilst sat outside on a warm sticky night. Very drinkable and highly refreshing.","TheLongBeachBum","Jul 08, 2003"

Nose is dominated by grassy wheat with additional aromas of coriander and lemon zest. Light to medium in body and very crisp and refreshing. Taste starts off with sweet malts and a bit of honey followed by some spicy notes of coriander and some acidic citrusy hops. A nice wit beer and a great brew for the summertime. Thanks to Loki for the sample!","Morris729","May 29, 2003"

Flavor is pretty light, with some lemon, a touch of coriander, and some wheat flavors. Very light and crisp, with medium carbonation. Definiety not the best wit I've had, but a very drinkable beer for the summer.","zerk","Apr 12, 2003"
3.47,1.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with no head at all. Aromas of coriander, orange, citrus, and maybe some honey on the nose. The nose reveals most of the tastes of coriander, citrus, honey, and wheat. This is a very, very light beer with little mouth feel and light carbonation. Very drinkable on a hot summers day.

Traces of lemon zest and orange juice throughout. Highly charged and very bubbly. All the refreshing traits of a BelgianWit, but a little uneven, thin, and watery. No where near the complexity, balance, and flavors of an Allagash White. It did serve it's purpose and was very refreshing on the dreaded Bartow to Yeehaw Junction stretch of Florida Highway 60.","StevieW","Beers"
