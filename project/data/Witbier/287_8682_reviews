"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Cloudy, light orange with copious white head and fair amount of lacing. Smells like a solid hefeweizen, yeasty, fruit esters – pineapple, bubble gum, banana. Tastes like a pretty solid wheat beer, a lot of citrus (lemon, orange).  Absent are the spicy notes, nice clean finish. Mouthfeel is light, a little soapy and very smooth and easily quaffable. This beer is a solid beer for spring and summer BBQ, the low ABV argues against the ‘winter’ aspect of it (it’s such an enjoyable beer, it could be imbibed year round). Hands down the best US wheat beer I’ve had – love the can for convenience and portability."

"Surprisingly drinkable. The whole concept is a surprise, but it's a pleasant wheaty brew. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."

"Can. Light golden and nearly clear body - suprising for a wit. Half inch of soapy white head. Aromas of wheat, apples, oranges, grass, cracked pepper. Moderate spice / pepper character with tangy oranges. Light to medium in body with a subtle fruity sweetness. Mild coriander in the nose and flavor. Easy drinking. Pretty good."

"A bottle poured into an IPA glass. Cloudy pale yellow with a clean white head that is decent and leaves some streaks and spots of lace all along the glass. A slow fade leaves a mild covering. Nose is excellent with a healthy sourness and wheat malt twang that shows amazing spiciness considering that this is not spiced. I'm blown away by the amount of clove, light coriander, bubblegum, pepper, and faint banana and light fruit esters all from just the grains, hops, (what there is) and yeast. Taste showcases classic wit tartness and lemony citrus notes. Mild cloves and cinnamon flow to a tight, light bitterness that releases bubblegum and soap, leaving a surprising dark graininess that lingers with mild almost graham like cracker flavors. Cinnamon and cloves hang in the background. Feel is velvety smooth and light with a mild creaminess. Superb drinkability and all around deliciousness, a great wit and right up there in my top five. As a winter ale the light and drinkable nature may seem a bit of a contradiction, the flavor and satisfaction in the drinking make for an enjoyable winter brew that would also do well in the warmer months."
""
"Overall- Not a bad beer at all.  Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure what type of style this beer is going for.  The beer doesn't have a strong coriander presence so it doesn't remind me of a witbier.  The flavors are much more of a hefeweizen.  The beer doesn't have the softness of most hefeweizens.  I would say the beer is an American wheat ale that uses a bavarian yeast strain."
"Not bad... an easy drinker.  Nice change of pace beer."

""

""
""
"Wasn't paying attention when I bought a six pack and thought it was more of a winter warmer. With that aside, the beer was just not tasty. Bland and thin."
""
"Flavor is more green apple dominant, with a lightly phenolic clove and pepper finish."
""
"Overall a solid beer that is worthy of a shot."
""
"I can taste the spices, but overall the mouthfeel seems to be a little lacking. Overall solid effort."
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking and gotta love 16 ounce cans"

"Flavor is complex. Starts sweet but ends dry. Lots of spices. True to style."
"Just not my thing. Did not enjoy it at all."
""
""
"One word describes this beer: blah. Nothing particularly notable about it. Perhaps the worst beer I've had from Bell's."
""
"Rating justified with a review."
"Basic white ale pretty tasty but doesn't jump out at you but very easy to drink"
""
""
""
"Definitely tasted bananas and a bit of spice. Hazy yellow color."
""
"Solid and enjoyable.  Some citrus and spice notes.  As a winter brew, it feels out of place among the holiday selections, though.  It tastes more like a March day when spring is trying to push winter aside."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh, bitterness doesn't work, very thin"
""
"Great tasting alternative to dark winter beers....definitely one of the more underated beers out there.  A very tasty enjoyable beer...."
""
"T - Bready and fruity.  Banana and sweet citrus. Some clove and banana.  Mildly bitter citrus aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a real fan of wheat beers. Good as wheat beers go."
"O - Personally, I dont partake in a lot of white/wheat ales, but this one is enjoyable and seems above average for the style."
""
""
"Not to my liking. A style I really gotten a tast for"
""
"Light yellow pour without much head. Tastes very similar to blue moon or shock top. Easy to drink, pretty good seasonal. Not strong at 5% and not a particularly mind blowing beer but solid overall."
""
""
""
""
"This is more of a refreshing summer brew. I would like this after mowing the lawn. The smell is citrusy, with a splash of bubble gum and banana. The taste is about the same with a slight tang and is fairly spritzy. Not bad, but not exciting. Save one for summer. I probably wouldn't get it again."

"Imbibed at the Bell's Eccentric Cafe in a Spiegelau Witbier glass.  It really does make a difference.  Also, be sure not to drink this at too low of a temperature.  Overall, I have become a fan."
"I like wheat ales. I like witbier. Why don't I care for this?!?!?! Btw I very much dislike the new set up of BA. :/"

"soft golden color, it does have a cloudiness. It has a light citrus odor. This is a very tasty, easy drinking beer. It reminds me of a blend between a Honey Weiss and Blue Moon. There is a slight aftertaste that reminds me of a Belgian tripel wheat just not as pronounced. This was a winner if you don't care for real dark or hoppy beers"
"Bell's Winter White Ale brewed by Bell's Brewery, Inc. This brew has an ABV of 5.0 %  Winter White Ale pours out cloudy amber color with a nice off white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it.  The smell is sweet with some grain and malts.  Winter White Ale smell is really mild.  Now for the taste, it is sweet like fruit juice.  You pick up on some malts, but it mild. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Winter White Ale has a nice balance to it.  Bell's Brewery, Inc. did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving Bell's Winter White Ale a solid 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"Damn cool, fermented with Belgian yeast ... no spices used so this is sort of a pale lighter Belgian winter warmer and not a Witbier at all in a sense but it is none the less."

"I tried this on tap at my local pub.  The beer had a nice light golden color with a smallish white head and minimal lacing.  A slight fruity, yeasty smell also comes out in the taste.  No taste of coriander or clove, but it does have a good, crisp mouthfeel.  Overall, I would say this is a pretty solid witbier and I would order it again."
""
""
"I know this often gets rated lower than most Bell's beers, or many beers in general, but I like it. To me, it's a simple, refreshing, everyday winter beer that's goes down easy. I can drink it with dinner or while watching the ballgame. I like the fruitiness and the spices. I will admit that it borders on a summer beer rather than a winter, but I truly enjoy it.  It's one of those beers I try not to overthink -- I just like it as a solid, simple, balanced beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark and hazy gold. The white head burns off quickly. The aroma is light hit has nice light spice and wheat notes. The taste is much the same if not a little more robust. It has nice thickness and a pleasant hint of carbonation."
"I had beer at my local taproom. A/cloudy yellow glass was brought to me in a standard pint glass. S/I didn't pick up too much here, just a touch of yeast and hops. T/Not much going on here.  I got a small amount of hops, banana, and yeast. O/ Light easy drinking beer.  Not very complex but very enjoyable and non offensive.  I found that the remainder of my glass went very well with the pizza that was brought to me.  I would pick this up for a lazy afternoon where you just want something light."

"Normally don't go in for Wits but this is pretty good. Pours a very pale cloudy yellow. Heavier mouthfeel. Light and ""belgiany"" overall, slight spice (apparently just from the malts, the description says none were added) and fruity on the nose and palate. Abrupt finish."

"Where did all that head run off too? Seems under-carbonated. Banana, pineapple, funky yeast on the nose but none of that in the flavor. Crisp and clean to a fault. Not offensive, but wont cop again."
""
"The first beer I have ever had from bells that was a let down, and honestly one of the few that wasn't amazing. This pours thick and murky tired yellow with basically no head from the tap. It's got a ton of viscosity and minimal carbonation, the opposite of what I look for in the style. Banana yeast and spice and orange esters in the nose, some citrus to the taste, but way too much grain here, especially the wheat. It lacks all the delicate features of the bets wits, and warms up ugly. I'm surprised this came from bells. It's not a bad beer, but it's nowhere near their full potential. I see the winter side of it, and appreciate the attempt, but I just doesn't pan put here"
""

"Was super excited when I saw the amount of yeast at the bottom of bottle but to be honest it didn't live up to my expectations. I was on a beer tour this particular evening and had enjoyed an unibroue Blanche de chambly earlier in the evening and when compared to this other north American brew I found myself disappointed but it's not a bad Belgian white. I just found the unibroue better. Still, better than most American Belgian whites"

"I find it hard to enjoy winter seasonal beer typically.  On the other hand, Bells Winter White Ale is a wonderful exception.  Tried in a tall boy pint, it has a very refreshing taste (I imagine even more robust from a tap).  Although I didn't see color, aroma is slighty citrus, and that is the definition of the finish.  The Belgian yeast makes this an incredibly enjoyable beer!  I found a winter seasonal that I would definitely order again (hopefully on tap....)."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/15/2013. Pours opaquely hazy bright golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, banana, pear, apple, orange, wheat, bread, floral, grass, clove, pepper, herbal, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, banana, pear, apple, orange, wheat, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, banana, pear, apple, orange, wheat, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice witbier. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"A wheat beer for winter. Nice, good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: I could get nit-picky about this beer and point out everything it lacks compared to the powerhouse Witbiers but that would not be fair. This is a solid Witbier with a lot to enjoy. Cheers!"
""
"This one pours a very cloudy Orange tan color with a short lasting pale white head. It leaves little lacing and retains just a slight film of foam throughout the pour. The nose of this one is very European with a sweet funky yeast aroma. There is peach and apricot notes with a lot of fresh bread aromas. The flavor follows suit. Quite funky, almost like a saison style. Sweet and malty and tangy and slightly sour all at the same time. The mouth is light and refreshing but effervescent and refreshing. This isn't a beer I'd come to often but definitely one worth trying and enjoying."

"Winter White pours a golden color with a nice head. There is a spicey aroma, with strong wheat notes, and strong orange peel notes. The flavor is a nice wheat and malty backbone, with good spices, and nice orange flavors. Nice full body. Overall its a nice wheat beer for the winter."
""
""
"Pours a clean gold with an excellent long lasting 3 finger head. Aromas of banana and bubble gum followed by malt are present on the nose of the beer. Malt and lemon rind on the palate with a watery finish. Small bubbles and and a light body with a medium finish. An ok beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a cloudy light gold with mild white head. Belgian yeast smell is characteristic, with pale malts contributing to the mellow and light flavor (barley and wheat). Malt taste, with very slight notes of citrus/coriander. Medium body, crisp carbonation. A nice light and drinkable winter beer, especially if you aren't big on spice."

"Poured out dark orange that is semi-transcelucent. Defintely can't see through it though. The head was pretty tiny and had no retention. Smells pretty malty, pretty sweet, with no hint of hops. Taste is quite sweet and tastes like Belgian yeast -- the banana/clove yeast. Really it tastes nice for a Wit. Pretty nice. Mouthfeel is medium thick with some nice carbonation. Overall this is a really nice whit, Tastes just like I would want it too. I am a sucker for a whit!!!! Overall this is a GREAT whit. Seems to be under-rated."

"A good wheat beer. One of the better ones I've tried. I will certainly purchase this again as a fun, easy to drink beer to enjoy with a burger and fries."

"Pours a cloudy golden with a nice white head that lingers and laces well. Light aroma of wheat, spice - probably clove - and Belgian yeast. Well carbonated with a light body, which is appropriate for the style. It tastes as a wit should, with spice being the primary flavor. In this case clove, coriander and a slight citrus background. Nice clean finish. Not in the same league as Allagash White, but a fine beer."
"Have I mentioned how refreshing this is? The complexity is all in the fruits, which may sadly overpower the spice. Not quite on par with Allagash White, but close."

"O: A nice witbier, certainly better than some others on the market."

"lots of co2, fizzy, light, citrus aromas that are slightly overwhelming. leaves a little to be desired. good foamy head that persists. in addition to citrus there is a nutty flavor that is there but does not add much to the beer overall. nice to drink once but would not buy again."

"Pours golden with nearly no head. Aroma is wheaty with banana yeastiness, some sweet honey, and a hint of spicy grain. Strong banana flavor up front with a sweet finish and just a hint of funky yeast throughout. Feels like more of a hefe than a witbier. Plenty of carbonation gives a little prickle on the tongue. Crisp finish that is not normally present for me in a wit. This is actually pretty pleasant and I would be happy to have another."

"O – This is another tasty and drinkable beer from Bell’s. I like all these refreshing wheat beers serving as winter seasonals. There are plenty of big and hearty beers out there during the cold months. These are a nice change of pace and make me think of warmer weather – never a bad thing."
"Very similiar to Trade Joe's wheat beer, almost ashamed to admit that I'd like something like that but if you look at this beer and that beers ratings they are almost identical."
""

"A nice, light witbier, good flavor, easy to drink, and sessionable. Good, would have again."

"this beer pours a a pale cloudy. it has a yellowish tint- looks good. the taste is spicy with a light citrus. this is a really refreshing beer- not as dark and robust as a lot of winter seasonals. this is a really drinkable winter ale. i actually did some yard work this morning and came inside and cracked this open- turned out to be a really good choice, this is a good afternoon, lighter beer. its fresh flavored, who says you have to have dark beer in the winter anyways?"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"I've had this before in the past, but it's been awhile. Pours a cloudy tangerine color (looks almost like freshly squeezed orange juice), thinner head than expected, but it leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are yeasty, orange, wheat. Tastes are nice with fruity Belgian yeast esters, wheat, orange zest, white peppery spiciness. I thought I could taste coriander, but apparently there's none used in the brewing process. Mouth-feel is nearly full-bodied while being creamy and smooth. Overall, better than I remember, and one of the better American brewed witbiers."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is rather easy to drink but lacks any refreshing and thirst-quenching properties. However, the added flavors of spices seem to make this a nice choice to drink if you want to enjoy a witbier during the winter."

""
"D - An average at best Witbier... There's nothing wrong per se, but this one falls short of my expectations for both Bell's and the style... An interesting winter interpretation, but nothing more... I can't recommend in good conscience and likely won't indulge in again myself..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good witbier. Packed with a nice array of flavors thanks to a decent contribution from malt, wheat, yeast, and hops all at once. Nice amount of spice, balanced by a subtle wheat sweetness and a blend of citrus and hops. Not bad at all."
"Great beer that surprises me everytime. Always happy to finally order one every year without really seeking it out. 4.0"

""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable - light in mouthfeel and with pleasant flavors and aromas. Definitely able to be a session beer. Some aspects of a hefeweizen in addition to the traditional witbier flavors/smells."
""
""
""
"Hazy orange/straw yellow, finger of white head with medium retention and ok lace. Nose pops with some wheat, very subtle spice and some citrus zest. Good bit of banana as well. Taste has more wheat and pale malt, a bit of banana, light coriander and yeast flavours. Medium body with a bit of texture/chew. Medium high carb, appropriate for the style. Quite tasty, I'd session this if I had a case in the summer."

"O - Bell's Winter White might not be a hearty, rich, high alcohol brew loaded with holiday spice, but this classic features just enough heft and yeast profile to provide a witbier unlike it's summer counterparts. When you're looking for an escape from the bold and strong beers of the season, look no further."

"Overall: another solid seasonal from Bell's. not a beer that i am gonna race to get next winter, but it sure hits the spot after a bit of a burn out on heavier and darker drinks. easy to find as most MI bars have a Bell's seasonal option"

"Poured this Witbier from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a light golden color, produced a white head, retention was below average. The aroma consisted of light malted grain, banana, clove and lemon citrus. Light in body, a base of malted wheat, with yeast flavors of banana, citric lemon, and spicy clove. Overall decent beer, nice session beer."

"O - a very good wheat beer, citrusy sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice wheat with good citrus flavor. The sediment in the bottom of the glass bothered me, and the smell was pretty bland. A good beer, but was expecting more from Bell's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"No substance and all water!"

"Overall - An above average wit beer that has some nice citrus flavours going on. Its very drinkable but at times it reminded me of something like a blue moon or a shock top. Anyways, still happy I tried it but I wouldn't see it out again."
""
""
"I’ll admit I’m not the biggest fan of the style but this is a good one. Sure, I’ll have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This American-brewed wit brings a minimalist impression, seeming held back by it. The smell works, but could be more intense, while the appearance is pleasing in its luminous impenetrability. The flavors seem underdeveloped, which doesn't really elevate this beer over notables of the style. It is refreshing, but not at all memorable."
"Belgian white ales are one of my favorite styles and this is an excellent example. I am grateful that Bell's releases this in the winter as opposed to the summer. It gives me something to enjoy during the winter months when I want a break from the heavier winter beers. If you enjoy Belgian-style wit beers, do not pass this one up."

"O- Witbier is a style of beer that I dont have a lot of experience with and is sometimes quite questionable. This is the best Witbier I have had so far. For anybody who is curious about the style, I dont know of any better for a beginner. This is a good beer for about any occasion."
""
""
"Pour is a cloudy yellow. no real head from a semi aggressive pour. sweet oranges and a nice spiciness. light body. has a full yeasty body, but a nice sweet orange feel to it. Lemon rind as well. A spiciness that Im assuming is from the yeast. Finishes clean."
"Pours a pale cloudy yellow with a head that quickly fades to nothing, save for a few bubbles dotting the rim, and a frothy film. Some cloudy sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Smell is grain, skunk, some pepper, a touch of citrus-y hops, and an odd dryer sheet scent. Taste is crisp corn off the bat, fading into a peppery citrus hop taste, ending with more corn and a slightly unpleasant aftertaste of skunky grain. There's some smoke flavoring in there as well, a friend remarked it tasted exactly like beef jerky. A tad undercarbonated, finish is dry."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall – A pretty nice wit. It has a nice feel and a pretty good flavor, but is just a little weak in smell and aroma."
"O-This witbier really does it for me. Not overally spiced or flavored, but a beautiful smooth taste that is simply delicious from start to finish. It does taste a bit more like a hefeweizen (fruits present are more banana than citrus) than most."
""
""
""
""
"D - I like my veggie on a plate, but it was fun to try."
""
"I recommend this one, it is well worth trying. Has the ""big beer"" Hefeweizen sort of rich and bready flavor profile on a sessionably low ABV with the texture and easy drinking qualities of a regular witbier."
""
""
""
""
"I used to love these Belgian white ales, but it's safe to say I'm over them. One every now and then is a refreshing change of pace, but even then I'm looking elsewhere for my wit fix."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all, I'll preface by saying I'm not a huge fan of witbiers. That being said, this one is a little syrupy and has that classic Witbier taste. A good representation of the style, but overall not a great beer. It's decent, but nothing to write home about. Try this if you like the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: I am a white ale fan and I was really suprised by this one. Had a great creamy spiciness to it. Well balanced."
"Different for a ""winter"" beer. Definitely not my favorite witbier, and like most witbiers i can't figure out if i like it or not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good witbier, hard to believe this is not brewed with any spices, it is very coriander forward tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is light and mildly spicy with a nice finish. I liked this beer but it is an average not very orange-y / citrusy backing to it. Interesting but not great."
""
""
""
""
"In fairness, I drank this beer to cap off a night where I had already drank my top 2 rated beers on this site and was just looking for something that didn't leave me completly hung over the next morning. This beer tasted like a nice wheat beer with a little bit of winter spice kick. The color was really light which was a nice change of pace for a winter brew."
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a good refreshing brew and a nice winter alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a well balanced Witbier. The usual spices and fruit notes play well together and dont overwhelm."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I'd say it's pretty good. It's not the best wit I've had, but it's not bad either. I probably wouldn't buy it again but I wouldn't turn one down. I'd still recommend it, because it's a good wit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice and refreshing Witbier. Would be great in the hot summer weather."
"Very nice wit style for the winter. Great mouthfeel - very smooth and light. Flavor was right-on. I enjoyed the Belgian-style flavor; nice but not too overbearing. Overall, this is a go to beer for the winter and wish it was available year round. Will need to stock-up while its in the market."
"O - Very refreshing, good mix of flavor and not overly sweet"
""
"Overall – Not a bad-tasting brew at all, but not a whole lot of complexity to it."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a nicely sippable beer that is quite refreshing and well worth drinking. That said, it is at best a solid workmanlike witbier that I won’t hesitate to have again but which I won’t go out of my way to acquire since I prefer the St. Bernardus Wit and the Allagash White."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 6pk = Register checkout: house beer, $1 even. Meh..."
""
"Mouthfeel is light on this beer, carbonation isn't over the top either. Technically it would be chuggable, but then you wouldn't be enjoying it, would you?"
""
"Overall, a very good version of the style. Slight wheat body, slight spice flavors and fairly light bodied."
""
""
"Cloudy gold in appearance. Smell is to much like your typical Witbier. Mouthfeel is standard for this syle of beer. Falls short for a winter style beer. Taste, the spices stick in the mouth, this takes away from the desirability. Overall this beer is way to typical and the spices take away from this beer. Not our cup of brew. Drinkable, just not something we prefer."
"O: awesome drink-ability, but not very interesting, pretty basic. Definitely a spicy/winter drink. It's nice, but not great."
""
""
"It doesn’t particularly stand out from other Belgian Whites, but it’s a solid brew from Bell’s."
""
""
"O -- a fine example of the style, with only a slight departure from normal witbier prep. -- without the packaging, I would not have noticed this one is ""seasonally nuanced"". A winter ale for the tropics, perhaps."
""
""
""
"O - Nice flavors, nothing that wowed me. Almost like a hef."
"I suspect that this batch is a little old which is why it's a bit underflavors and doesn't live up to expectations of some other witbiers. It almost tastes like it's been watered down. Still definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A pretty easy drinking, if not particularly interesting, wheat."
"From a lottle to a pilsner glass. Very cludy pale yellow in apprearance with a small white head that fades. Grassy aroma. Taste is grassy with wheat and hint of citrus. This tastes like a thin Hefeweizen. Strong carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, tasty and overall a pleasant beer to drink, just don't expect a punch."
"Overall: Although the first impression is not great going by the appearance and aroma, it's one of the better Witbiers I have experienced. Well done once again, Bell's!"
""
""
"O - A great Belgian white that leaves me satisfied. Out of all the seasonal beers this year I could definitely say I really enjoy this one. Usually when I think Belgian white beer I do not associate it with winter."
"Overall this is a very good witbeer. it doesn't try to be too much, just as advertised. Nice job bell's."
""
""
"Pretty thin for my tastes, but it's still good flavor."
""
"o: There are a hell of a lot more bad wits than good ones in this country imo. This was one of the latter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I've read that this beer is brewed without the addition of any spices. Not sure if that's true but if it is it's a testament to the artfulness of the brewer; there's a yeasty complexity that really imparts the clove and coriander seed flavor. Nice alternative to the more heavy handed spiced wits on the market."
""
""
"Appearance is a cloudy gold color. The modest head fades pretty quickly, with no lacing left behind. The scents and taste are very much like a hefeweizen - banana and clove come through strongly in both, and there is a slight lemony note as well. Nothing outstanding going on, just a good solid wheat beer. Bell's ought to sell this year round as a hefe. I'd put it about on par with Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis."
""
"Overall Impression- A great refreshing White Ale from Bells but not one of my favorites from this style. Have enjoyed MANY wit biers lately and this one is just a notch above average. Wouldn't mind picking up some of the newer stouts from Bell's!"
""
""
""
""
"O - confuses me, plenty of other white ales I'd rather have"
""
"O: While I give Bell's props for creating a white beer as a winter seasonal, I find that there are some good reasons why it's not often done. As a white beer it's pretty mediocre, and as a winter seasonal I'm still confused."
""
""
"Overall - Very smooth, weak and easy to drink. Too watered down for my liking, this could be a nice beer to give a rookie or non beer drinker. Its not bad but there are alot better beers of this style out there."
""
""
""
""
"Not the greatest wit ever, but a solid offering and a nice treat every now and then during the winter months when a good, fresh wit can be hard to find."
""
""
"O - While not the best winter offering from Bell's, it's still a staple. I try to pick up a sixer at least once a winter."
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. A more phenolic take on the style, this isn't going to blow any minds, but it's definitely solid. I'm not sure how I'd feel drinking this in the dead of winter, as I seem to enjoy these beers more in the warmer months, but I guess I'll have to try it again later in the winter to find out!"
""
""
""
"O: The head was disappointing, but the nose and taste are solid. Nice alternative to other winter offerings."
"O - Not too impressed, but its not too bad either."
""
"Though it's a decent tasting beer, I think Bell's fell a little short of my expectations on this one. There are plenty of better witbiers out there, and I doubt I'll be clamoring to buy more Winter White for a while."
""
""
"Recommended. Stays with the style."
""
"Pours a cloudy deep straw color. Unfiltered and bottle conditioned wheat beer. In the taste, wheaty almost hefeweizen like flavors with some lemon and clove, and orange peel leaving a citrusy burst. Light peppery spice is also noted. Crisp, clean, refreshing witbier with solid flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, almost dry. Overall, a very nice option to have in your fridge this time of year, paired well with some chili/sesame chicken wings."
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid take on a Witbier and a nice change of pace for a winter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very far cry from your ""blue-moon-esque"" wits. This is a very complex, well balanced and flavorful witbier. This is a seasonal release from Bell's, get it while you can - and get Hoegaarden when you can't ;)"
""
"Cloudy orange-gold with a little white head that shrinks to a thin ring. Clove and subtle banana aroma. Perfumy orange and wheat. Coriander and banana with a bit of peppercorn. Tangy wheat and grain aftertaste. Smooth, floaty medium mouthfeel...prickly carbonation and fairly drying. A solid, drinkable wit from Bell's."
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft gold appearance with a hazy quality. Smell is ok. Hint of banana and lemon with a bit of clove. Taste is a nice crisp/sour spice. Very subtle compared to some other Bell's features. The mouth feel is light with decent carbonation. Overall this winter wit is very drinkable. A good beer for holiday meals as the winter spice will accent your meal and wont overpower any foods."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice, luminous straw color with plenty of haze, and small white head. Nose isn't overly assertive, but pleasantly alive with some clean orangey yeasty bready notes. Palate offers a good dose of wheaty cracker, some nice sour flavors that wind into the coriander and citrus candied qualities (but not very candied overall). Good carbonation. Easy to drink, but just doesn't dance on the palate as vividly as some other wits that I really liked over the years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is way too light to be a winter seasonal...they could have added more body to this and it would have been a little better...I wish the finishing spices would have been balanced by the lemon zest like in the middle of the beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - decent white ale. nothing is wrong with it except the lack of visible yeast but it is nothing that exciting."
""
""
"Overall: I generally really enjoy Bell's but this one didn't do it for me."

"83."
"On tap or in bottle (tap better of course), I recommend this seasonal ale while you can get it."
"The taste is balanced and mild, with sharp wheat notes and orange zest playing leisurely with a little spice for warmth. Pleasant and enjoyable."
"Overall - Actually pretty decent. It's not groundbreaking (though it doesn't taste like most wits I've had), it's less spicy but nicely balanced."
"O- This beer seems like a good merger of the American Pale Wheat with a witbier. Worth a try."
"A dilemma of a beer to rate. If this is a Witbier, it missed the mark. Simply not enough spice and off-kilter flavors. Then again, maybe it's us, and not Bell's that think it's a Witbier. Fair enough, but that leads to the next problem; As far as I can tell, Winter White is completely indistinct from Oberon. Would love to drink them together, because I think there's no more than a whisker difference. Lastly, there's really no seasonal panache to this. What's winter about it? At the end of the day, though, this is a tasty, if unremarkable beer, and that's what matters most."
"Overall, its not among the styles I prefer, but a good branch out and overall solid brew."
"Overall, a pretty good attempt at witbier I wouldn't mind having again."
"This is a decent, inoffensive and light tasting beer that isn't very complex. I'm a little disappointed because seasonal beers tend towards possessing attributes that fit with the season-- halloween gets the crop of pumpkin flavored beers, summer sometimes rustles up some sort of jalapeno-flavored creation and so on. This *winter beer* has nothing ""wintry"" about it apart from the name and the label artwork-- certainly nothing that suggests the scents and smells of winter (cinnamon, nutmeg, pine, chocolate, burning wood or even a decade-old, rock hard fruitcake.) The scents are typical average witbier: bread, wheat and yeast. There's a slight hint of citrus but it's gone quickly and doesn't translate into taste-- which is similarly average. So, why am I paying 11 bucks for a six pack of this when I could be trying that Allagash Dubbel I passed over?"
"Pours dark yellow with a frothy white head. Smell is dominated by the yeast, with a nice dose of wheat. Flavor follows suit, nice yeast and wheat flavors. A nice medium mouthfeel, smooth, well balanced and nice depth of flavor. Overall a great witbier, great flavor, and an easy drinking beer."
"Overall, it is like a good fastball: to the point, but states its purpose very well. This is an expertly-crafted wheat ale."
"O: A nice Witbier. I would definitely have again. Seems strange to have it be a winter beer, but why not?"
"O- Yeah, pretty average across the board. Won't be paying to drink this again when there are so many more flavorful witbiers out there. The first letdown I've had from Bell's."
"O - Wasn't overly impressed with this beer. Had an ok taste, but I've had much better witbier's than this."
"Overall: Very poor example of a witbier. Doesn’t seem thick enough but it does have good smell and great appearance"
"Overall - a satisfying and nicely spicy wheat beer with enough complexity to set it apart."
"Winter, though?"
"Taste - Echoes the aroma upfront with sweet wheat malt, coriander and ornage. Finishes clean with a lingering orange juice flavour and a light spiciness."
"O: A pretty middle of the road and mediocre Witbier. Not my favorite."
"This brew pours out as a hazy yellow color with a fluffy white head. There was a slight amount lacing on the glass. The smell was a little spicy and had some wheat aromas. The taste has a light spice to it with a kind of refreshing lemon zest. Mouthfeel is a little light and is a little watered down. Overall I've never understood why a white ale would be a winter release. I prefer the dark winter brews personally. This is an ok brew."
"o - kind of a blah wit overall."
"O: Decent brew. Almost a summer brew for winter. A weak sister to a Tripell as far as the flavor. Nice drinker."
"Wasn't what I was expecting, but a good beer anyway. Not so much a winter warmer as it is a Belgian. As expected from Bell's, a nice beer."
"Impressive with no spices, not great, but not bad."
"Overall: It's light and refreshing, and very drinkable. It manages to be bold enough to miss being boring, but it isn't that exciting, either. This is a decent beer, but that's all: I would drink it again, but I'd be more likely to try something else first."
"O - A very nice brew. Honestly, I'd rather have a glass on a hot summer day than by the fire, but really there's no bad time of year to enjoy a good beer : )"
"Medium bodied with a good amount of effervescence. Smoothish finish leads to a nice malty banana fade. A good brew."
"Finish: Coriander sticks with you for some time, with a small amount of hops on the back of the palate"
"Fairly drinkable. Not anything that stands out, but satisfies as a wheat beer."
"Figured I'd take this one down now, seeing that Winter is in its death throes 'round here (knock on wood). It pours a thoroughly hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises lemon zest, coriander, mint, pine, orange peel, and wheat. Honestly, the sharp bit of mint I get does nothing good for the smell, but it's luckily not enough to sabotage the entire occasion. The taste, though, does away with this unpleasantness, while straying none too far from the path already laid out by the smell. The orange peel, though, is a touch stronger than before, and a pinch of black pepper is thrown in there as well. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a nice wit. 'Nuff said."
"Good witbier; not exactly a style meant to ""wow"" the drinker, yet still Bell's provides a flavorful offering not generally found this time of year."
"Nice wheat beer."
"The drinkability is off the charts, though. This one goes down like water... or orange juice! A great session beer."
"M/D: Light bodied, very clean and crisp. Refreshing and easy to drink. Overall solid."
"D: I know this beer is not for everyone but it is one of my favorite wheats, especially around the holidays!"
"Overall: Its a decent representation of the style, just a little thin and watery. Honestly, there are much better offerings for the price. Decent beer, but not one I will necessarily buy again."
"D: Goes down easily, tasty, not filling, very mild kick, ok representation of style. It hit the spot that evening and is something I would certainly drink again."
"D - It is an alright beer. I do not think that I will seek it out, but I would not turn one done either."
"Pours a bit of a hazy yellow color, nice white head on it. Smells sweet, citrusy, with a bit of spice to it. Taste is very refreshing. Very smooth, wheat with lemon taste. Good medium bodied beer. I really enjoyed this beer. Very good drinkability, I'll definitely be looking for this beer in the future."
"D - A different twist on a winter beer. It's very much in the hefeweizen style but doesn't have the crispness in the finish you'd want in the summer. Very tasty. Could easily drink several of these in a session."
"It seems like this is one of those beers that I wasn't 100% on the first few sips, but by the end of the beer, I had completely changed my mind. A great taste. An awesome aroma. These are the traits than rang through the most for me. A little too flat looking in it's appearance, maybe. Also, I like to see the lacework on the side of my glass, and this had none. The head leaves quickly. But the smell and taste is spot on."
"Not a winter warmer but a good bear nevertheless. Could drink quite a few of these in a sitting."
"D - Nicely drinkable, but I don't get the ""winter", not really my favorite style in February. Gimme this in June and I'd be happy."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Poured a hazy yellowish color with a decent off white head. Aroma was malts, clover, yeast, bread, and spices. Flavor was spice, vanilla, and malts. Medium body, light carbonation. Smooth on the palate. I've had better winter warmers."
"My typical standard of measurement for wit beers is Hoegaarden. Bell's Winter White might be my new standard. First off, I love that they used the white winter theme to brew a beer like this out of season. Typically, wheat beers can only be found fresh during the summer. It is nice to know you can find one light and refreshing in the winter too as a six-month old wit beer sipped in January would almost certainly be stale. Not this--it had a crisp clean freshness that comes only from hefty doses of wheat played against the musty phenols of the belgian yeast. I could not smell or taste any orange or coriander, lemon or lemongrass, just nice round full bready yeast. Even the color was pale yellow, though not as white as Hoegaarden. It did not feel overly fizzy or thin, as can sometimes be the case for this style. Excellent drinker. High marks all around."
"D: Love it every year have at least a sixer."
"I have to say when I think of Winter Beer this is not it, but for a mix it up from the normal winter time brews this was nice."
"D: A very enjoyable and easily drinkable brew, what you come to expect with most Bell's products...I would definitely recommend this brew, but my only knock would have to be that a winter 'white ale' seems slightly out of place for the season, albeit delicious..."
"D- Very fun beer and easy to drink. A good example of the style and I am glad I grabbed a sixer"
"D- Haven't had a lot of winter ales, but this one is a good solid beer. Nothing over the top, but a good drink."
"D: Quite sessionable, however I'd recommend serving more chilled."
"Bells is a great brewery and its a shame that they don't distribute in MA. I recently bought a sampler case that this beer, the pale ale, best brown ale, and amber ale. A beautiful light straw colored beer that lightly greets your nose with the typical witbier aroma. Nothing too exciting or flashy about this beer, its just a well crafted ale by a good brewery."
"A well made beer that breaks the norm."
"Overall I think this beer tasted crisper than the bottle I had quite a while back and I certainly prefer it more. A solid beer that's worth a shot in whatever form."
"Overall a very solid little ale and one that I needed to take a break from the rest of the evening!"
"Libation: So this isn't a stellar example of the style, but it's certainly a great effort. It fits in very well amongst the great many offering from Bells. Flavorful, drinkable, and not too ""Big"" of a beer to overwhelm after a few sips."
"D - Good, I could drink plenty of these. Goes down very easy."
"D: it's good but I've liked others white better."
"d - A nice, above average witbier. Some nice bananas and spices in the nose and taste. Nothing about it wowed me, but I would have it again if I was looking for a witbier."
"Amidst all of the traditional winter brews - warmers, stouts...this is a refreshing change of pace brew - hellava good session brew..."
"Overall: Well balanced and something that reminds me of a hefeweizen as well as a witbier."
"Overall is this was a nice winter white. I have always been a fan of this beer and I think its a great wheat based beer for the winter. Bell's never disappoints and this is no exception."
"Drinkability: Very good and treat on w winter night."
"Pours an extraordinarily hazy yellow orange color with a thick white head that sticks around awhile. Smells of oranges and spices probably from the yeast. Tastes of clove, oranges, and other spicy yeast and plenty of that awesome wheat flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is heavy. Drinkability is above average."
"Drinkability: Slightly spicy and generally unassuming profile and easy ABV make for an easy to drink brew."
"Taste is a little sweet up front like an orange, then coriander and bit of spice to finish it off. It's really not that bad but this just isn't the style of beer for me and it seems like an odd choice for a Winter beer."
"I appluad Bell's for thinking outside the box with this winter seasonal, but my only gripe is that nothing besides the label suggests that this is actually a ""winter beer."" And this was consumed on a snowy 17 degree evening, but as far as the beer goes, it would've fit in just as well on an 85 degree summer night. Maybe some warmer spices and a little more depth would make the ""winter"" designation more fitting."
"Pours a completely murky honey straw yellow. A thin white head patches to the glass. Smell is muted; hints of fesh and harvested grass and lemon. Taste is a concoction of aromatic seeds, herbs, and peels. Wheat body is medium. Feel is very citric and tart, a bit on the thin side, with a pleasant bitter finish. Drinkability good and easy. Like most of Bell's offerings, this one is a bit off-kilter from the style ""standard."" I liked it decent, though."
"Drink- Very high, I could easily drink a 6 pack of these in a short period of time."
"Drinkability: Refreshing blend of Hefeweizen and Witbier. I have read this beer uses a blend of both yeast strains, and that really comes forth. I guess this has to be classified as a Witbier since that style is a little more loosey-goosey with the rules than the Germans are. Strange that it's a winter seasonal, and it may look like terrible, but it is a tasty brew."
"I could throw back a few of these but there was nothing special about it that I would get another 6pk. Great Taste just a little on the boring side!!"
"If you are in the mood for a light not so complex beer I think you will not be disappointed. This was exactly the beer I was looking for tonight."
"Leave it to Bells to give us a witbier in winter. Kudos"
"This is definitely not like most other ""winter brews."" Although I desired a bit more taste, Winter White Ale is crisp, refreshing, and has year-round drinkability."
"Overall: excellent example of a traditional white ale. Was hesitant to have since I associate Wits with summer but this hit the spot for a cold December day."
"D: This is not my favority Belgian style but it surpasses my typical Witbier expectations."
"This is a nice change of pace for the winter. A light mouthfeel with much lighter flavors than normal for the season."
"Like I said, I liked the beer. Just having a lot of difficulty separating this from any other wit. I would drink this in the summer and enjoy it just as much."
"D: Through the roof."
"Decent Witbier. Nice and drinkable. Typical great quality from Bell's. Worth trying, especially if you enjoy the style."
"Drinkability - Honestly, I have never been a huge fan of ""Wit"" or ""White"" ales. The peppery spice is a bit much for me, but for the style it fits nicely. This beer reminds me more of a Summer brew than a Winter warmer. I'm sure this beer has an audience and I'm glad I tried it, but I'll probably move on from this one."
"D - it goes down easy."
"Drinkability -- Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't put it in the best of the style or of the brewery; one could certainly have picked worse. Glad I tried it, but I'll likely pass next time around."
"D: It is a nice change of pace from massively malty and spicy holiday beers, but falls short of being a great seasonal."
"D: Somewhat drinkable. At this point, I'm losing interest in witbiers, but still a good summertime diversion."
"3.5 D: Aside from the mouthfeel, this is a pretty solid brew. Good nose and good taste, but that isn't always enough. I'll forgive Bell's though since they make some damn good stuff overall."
"Taste has light citrus, and is generally pretty underwhelming, but suited to the style. Smooth watery mouthfeel, and overall a refreshing beer, but I'd put it closer to Blue Moon then it would probably like."
"I would get this again if I was looking for a wheat. Would probably not get the mini keg...I had to drink a lot of beer, cause other peeps who aren't craft beer enthusiasts didn't like it as much."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a bit of lingering head. Smells primarily of Belgian yeast, spices. Tastes of Belgian yeast, your usual winter spices, coriander, anise, wheat. Lingering spice mixture, medium body, well-rounded, full flavor, amply spiced but not overwhelming, mellow."
"Drinability is straight down the middle. Meh... I've had considerably better. Lord knows.. I've had worse."
"D: The cloves are very overpowering in this beer, and it reminds me of a hefeweizen much more than a witbier because of that. I don't really think it works that well with the Belgian yeast. Another one that disappointed me from Bell's, but there are quite a few of their beers that I'd highly recommend. It seems that I either love or hate their beers."
"It has a nice wheat color. Poured to a two finger head which dissipated quickly. Banana is the most pungent scent cloves are also present. The winter wheat has good mouth feel and has a bit of inconsistency(which is a good thing). There is a nice hint of nut and banana that linger as the aftertaste. It is a smooth beer that isn't over-spiced. I suggest it. Its a tasty beverage"
"Pours a straw-colored yellow, opaque, mild carbonation apparent, with minimal head, gone entirely within several minutes. Nose is strong wheat, honey notes with lemony essence. Carbonation masks much of the flavor up front. More intense than I expected. The numbness in my tongue reminiscent of the aftereffect of cloves. Lemon rind at the back. Bananas in the aftertaste. This is the first wheat-beer I've really enjoyed. I appreciate the complexity and clear notes in this one. Decently drinkable!"
"Overall: This is a style of beer I rarely reach for when beer shopping. Bells WInter White Ale is a good version of the style. Pretty spot on for the style. This is a nice change of pace from the Imperial Stouts and dark beers I've been drinking."
"Notes: Slightly different witbier. More wheat and citrus. Doesn't really excite me, nor does it really succeed for me as a winter seasonal. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite."
"D: While this beer is uneven in spots, it's still an enjoyable, drinkable beer."
" If you're into that."
"Comes out of the tap a hazy, opaque amber with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is honey-sweet and malty with a hint of lemon. Yeasty, malty, honey-sweet flavor has a lemony undertone. Thick, smooth, fizzy texture leaves a subtle tingle and a yeasty, rubbery, citrus finish."
"D: A crisp and sweet beer - but perhaps a little too sweet to really toss these back."
"Hey its Saturday night live with a great wheat beer.The aroma is fruity with a hint of yeast. Full of flavor. With bananas, cloves,and a bit of lemon too.It has a nice golden haze.As far as drinkability I could easily drink these all night. All were missing for a winter ale is more alcohol.The label says abv. is 5.0.The label is nicely designed with trees and snow.Makes me feel like taking a winter walk through the woods to grandma's house.I hope the beer at her house is this good. Other than that this is a very smooth tasting beer.I will be buying more soon."
"Drinkability: Went well with a spicy beans and rice dish, but I can't see myself buying it again. It's just an okay beer."
"I really enjoyed this brew and bell's different take on a winter ale."
"Easy to drink and definitely a future repeat purchase. A nice witbier."
"ABV makes it very drinkable, but I'd prefer to switch to something else after a couple. Push comes to shove, I could shove these down all night."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable. Tasty and easy drinking, this is a decent witbier despite the fact it is totally out of season. Bell's did not do enough to justify offering a witbier for the winter months. I appreciate the effort, but I expect something more unique than something true to style."
"D: This was a very bright and crisp beer, which seemed better suited for summer than winter. But it had an enjoyable taste and appropriate body, and it was quite easy to drink. I have no real complaints, but the beer didn't really excite me either."
"Cloudy, bleach blonde with a small white head. Orange peel and coriander spice with wheat malt in the aroma. This is a nice Wit and it has all the classic flavors of one, wheat malt tang, coriander and citrus peel. Light bodied with fine carbonation. A good beer that seems an odd choice for a Winter seasonal and more suited to a summer lawnmower beer."
"Pours out a hazy yellow color, with a smallish white head. Left the dredge in the bottom of the bottle. Nice carbonation in my glass...smell is slightly sour, some faint fruity/esteryness, but pleasantly no spice or coriander. Ahh, the taste is crisp, and a nice dry aftertaste. I can taste some phenolics almost reminds me more of a hefe than a wit and I like it. Some nice spicy clove from the yeast, again, more like a hefeweizen than any witbier I've ever had. I think Mr. Bell is like me, not a fan of spice in his beer....and this really makes for a nice, easy drinking beer. What is weird about this style though, is I wouldn't imagine it pairing with winter comfort food classics like pot roast, or pot pie....Mmm, pot pie. Might go well with another kind of pot, lol? In the end though, this is a nice crisp beer which is a pleasant change of pace from all the big IPAs or heavy stouts of winter, you know, when you're running around the house, cooking or cleaning and getting kinda hot and you just want something refreshing, I can see this one shining through in those sort of moments."
"D - Drinkability of this is ok I guess, just not what I thought, I suppose. I will not buying this again. I'll stick to my heavy warming winter beverages."
"This is worth trying, though I don't see this being as appropriate for winter as for warmer weather."
"This was a decent beer there was good flavor, but nothing really stood out. I wouldn't mind drinking this again but would not seek it out."
"Pours a hazy golden orange that has a decent head. The head left some decent lacing as it fell. You can tell this is unfiltered. Smell is spicy. there are notes of clove, citrus, and some coriander. The taste is pretty typical for this style. There is some spiciness, wheat, citrus, coriander, and clove. this beer has a lighter body with good carbonation. I'd say the drinkability is pretty good on this beer. Its a good beer, but I just can't find anything about it that really makes it stand out from other beers of this type. It's pretty typical, but I think it's a pretty nice winter beer."
"All in all, I usually prefer wits with more bold orange flavors, but this really went down quite well."
"The beer is a light gold color, with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of Belgian yeast, strong spices, light malts and some citrus. The taste is spicy up front with flavors of coriander and clove. There's a good background of Belgian yeast and light malts along with some complimentary citrus flavor. The hops presence is mild as you would expect. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly bready. Smooth and very crisp, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, clean finish"
"Taste, you pick up much of what you smelled: coriander, banana, lemon, ginger. Those aren't really nuanced either. They're big. Mouthfeel recedes a little, the flavors get muddled. The price is a little more than what I'd like to pay for these kinds of beers. Sure, there's some different stuff, but they're saving a ton by not having to put hardly any hops in it."
"Semi thin, decent carbonation but I would expect more for the style."
"A better white ale than most American versions I have tried. Spicy and lively, easy to drink and, although not a true winter beer, a really tasty ale."
"D- This beer is highly drinkable. Lower ABV makes this a easy 6 pack beer. Flavor isn't altogether there although this does have some age on it. I will look back onto this one next season when it first comes out. I remember it being a little more tasty fresh."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - A decent brew from Bell's, makes me think of a summer sipper then anything but yet still pretty drinkable brew anytime of the year. I recommend this brew and think that it is a pretty good session beer"
"Drinkable, but not one of Bells' bests."
"Received this as an extra from gratefulbeerhead. I'd tried this a few years back and was unimpressed, so it was nice to revisit."
"Drinkability is alright, a bit too spicey for me. Could use some more carbonation."
"I look forward to this winter seasonal every winter because it is a change to the status quo."
"Cheers."
"D - Decent witbier. Could use more tart/spice."
"The Winter White pours a golden orange color with lots of carbonated bubbles that shoot up from the laser engraved hop at the base of the SN glass. A nice frothy clear white head sits atop with no visible lacing. There is a nice sweet malt aroma with a solid hop backbone. Taste isn't nearly as pronounced as the nose is. Sort of watery but still some citrus and hop notes. A little too light for me. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp and with this being a winter ale there should be a little more bit and thickness to the mouth. Drinkability is overall pretty solid. The nose is great, quaff is mediocre and with a nice 5% abv makes it sessionable."
"BTW it's 5 percent by volume not 4.5 someone should really keep track of the ABV..."
"D: Very drinkable witbier. This variety was one of the first brews I had other than macro brews when I was young. So it will always bring back good memories."
"D: Very easy to drink. Mine was gone before I knew it. Nothing to really rave about, but good none the less."
"As long as I am mentioning that horrid ad's phrase, I should reiterate that this beer falls heavily on the ""less filling"" side, although it really DOES taste great. A nice change from other monstrous, super-hopped and -alcoholic winter beers."
"Had this out of a bottle and it just left me cold (no pun intended). I'm usually the biggest Bell's cheerleader around, but this is a massively disappointing beer. The smell and taste are extremely average. That's all you can really say about this beer. It's not terrible, but the 9.99 price tag is not justified in the least bit. You can do better than this, Bell's."
"The taste is ok, nothins special. This is not a winter beer. This is a generic beer, not to say it isn't a good sessional but this is more of a summer beer."
"Drinkability? It drinks ok but following one bottle with another, if I had one, would not be something I'd do."
"This beer will satisfy seasoned beer snobs and newbies alike. The smell is my favorite part, with an almost-aggressive phenol funkiness, with sweet grassy floral notes. After that, it's solid but unremarkable. It has all the right flavors in all the right places, and a little lingering orangy citrus at the end. It's ever-so-slightly thin in a way that makes me unsure whether to knock a half point off of taste or off of mouthfeel."
"Regardless, a delicious Witbier that is well worth enjoying multiple times, as this review hopefully showed. More good stuff from Bell's, one of the very best breweries that the US has to offer."
"M/D - Had a light body with lots of small carbonation bubbles. No traces of off flavors or too much tannins either. Refreshing and easy to drink, which is a bit different than most winter beers but it works."
"Poured into a chalice. Cloudy light orange in color, sparkling with minimal head. Smell is sour lemon, musty oranges, and pepper. Taste is loaded with lemon with some mixes of other spices. Not that complicated or interesting, but light and very refreshing."
"This beer screams average."
"D: Although I still enjoy this brew more on tap, it's amazing how much freshness they were able capture in this bottle."
"D: Pretty drinkable and a solid brew, but not my favorite Bells."
"Certainly, this isn't groundbreaking, but I really enjoy it. Heartier than a summer white, it's a nice quaff on a snowy day. I like it - there's more to it than most white beers I've had."
"F: Comes off pretty dry on the finish, with a big load of banana and more spices. It has a touch of spicy heat, some acidity. The spices seem to linger for a while, with even more orange peel this time. Its not a bad beer, a decent Belgian wit crossed with winter warmer, which is starting to become commonplace. This goes a little heavy on spices but not too much to still enjoy it."
"bought this to have something to session on tonight before i hit the heavy hitters up later...hears to a new year starting"
"Comparisons: I would rather drink both Hoegaarden or Allagash White over this brew, but I would take Bells Winter White over a Blue Moon any day."
"Light and crisp, well carbonated. Easy drinker of course. Not sure what this has to do with winter other than the name, but it is a great witbier in my opinion. I would love to hit this on a hot summer day,"
" ~ This is a great beer. I recommend this brew to everyone looking for a sessionable winter style brew. It has very good aroma character that's backed up with an even better feel and collage of flavors. Give this one a try, you won't regret it."
"Overall a good witbier and enjoyable. It's nice to see one as a winter seasonal instead of summer but it probably works better in the warmer months."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but not a choice for te winter...would do more of aheavier higher gravity beer."
"Not a bad change-up from some of the heavier winter beers."
"Drinking this on Christmas night along with a couple other Bell's products. Pours hazy gold with white head. Smells and tastes of cloves, coriander, citrus peels, etc. Body is medium with plenty of carbonation. A nice spicy witbier for a cold winter night, but not one I'm going to session all night."
"D: An easy to drink beer, not something I enjoy in the winter time, but a nice offering."
"This was quite similar to Great Lakes Holy Moses. There were spicy notes in both the flavor and aroma with elements of coriander, orange and wheat. This is surprisingly drinkable for a winter white ale with moderate alcohol and a very clean flavor and finish. This would probably taste good at any time of the year."
"Easy drinker, but just not the right time of year for me to down this one. Weather needs to be warmer to truly enjoy this style."
"The feel is there and light with low but nicely leveled carb. Goes down smooth and all to easy. A bit of a grainy and hayish aftertaste. Im not a big wit guy but I would not mind having a few anytime of year. I like how this comes out in winter keeping away from the onslaught of wit's in summertime, I just wish they made another batch for the summer with a nice summer themed label."
"Golden body topped by a thin white head. Strong Coriander aroma backed by bits of herablness and a hint of honey. Flavor is immediately sweet up front for just a moment, then the coriander and hop bitterness kick in. Mouthfeel is rather smooth with just about perfect carbonation. Drinkability is good. Wouldn't mind a few of these once the weather warms just a touch."
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale ale with barely any head. Head disappears completely after a small time. Smells sweet with just a hint of spicy coriander and orange rind. Some lemony citrus too. Taste is very pleasant - flowery and delicate with hints of citrus, flower and maybe a dash of brown sugar. Almost tastes like there is sorachi ace hops even though I assume there aren't any. Carbonation is dead on for the style and very drinkable. A very enjoyable brew but not super memorable."
"Don't see myself wanting this again, because the mouthfeel is just a disaster. The flavor is decent for the style, and just spicy and fruity enough to make it drinkable."
"D: I don't think I would go out of my way to drink Bells winter white. If I want a Hefe I will look elsewhere and if I want a White Ale I will look elsewhere. I don't need both at the same time."
"Drinks pretty easy, a pretty good Wit. My problem is why do a wit as a winter release? Bell does plenty of others sooo I guess it doesn't matter..."
"Decent, interesting beer. Poured with a decent, foamy, frothy, nice sized head and lots of lace. Color is a very cloudy light amber. Aroma is malty, yeasty, wheat, and a little fruity. Flavor's about the same, fruitiness more pronounced. Great body and carbonation. Easy drinking. Can actually pick up on the qualities of the different yeasts. Could be a session."
"Drinkability is good, drinks more like a warm weather beer to me but that isn't a bad thing."
"Thin mouth feel...very drinkable and refreshing. Good example of a white beer, I would have liked a little more ""winter"" seasoning..."
"Good drinkability, a nice lighter beer for a cold winter's night."
"Drinkability: Well, for starters, it could benefit from a bit more effervescence in the mouthfeel department, but even still, it's just rather mild and bland and doesn't really deliver in terms of a fine, refreshing witbier or a winter-based anything."
"Catch this one in its sweet spot -- too cold and you'll miss it, too warm and it gets a little off track. Decent witbier."
"Has a light wheat color with a orange hue when poured. Head was thin and white. Aroma was filled with spice and citrus, which was also in the taste. Going down, it was nice and and crisp. Not watery or too thick. Definitely a great seasonal and witbier."
"drinkability - this beer is a good change of pace from the stouts i drink in the winter"
"D - Not a bad brew, and I feel it was a fair representation of the witbier style. The title ""Winter White Ale"" would lead one to think this was a winter warmer rather than a witbier. I'm not a huge fan of the high ABV in winter warmers so this was actually a satisfying change for me, though I could see where it could lead to some confusion if it were bought as a winter warmer."
"I like this beer and am not sure why it's a winter brew, heavier than most, I think not. Would be fine in summer. This beats the crap out of Oberon for me."
"Poured a hazy yellow with a modest head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was malty sweet. The taste was sweet pears and bananas. The feel was light bodied with sufficient carbonation. Drinkability was good. Winter White reminded me of a less carbonated BSPA. Pretty good brew."
"Drinkability: Nice and robust flavors; body is fairly light and doesn't sit heavily at all; the ABV is more than manageable. Nothing wrong here, and I could easily sit through several of these - a potential sessionable beer."
"Though a drinkable and refreshing wheat beer, this is an odd choice for a winter seasonal. I guess it's a nice break from the slew of spicy, malty winter warmers, porters and stouts."
"D-the creamy mouthfeel makes it enjoyable to drink; but the carbonation at the finish takes away from that slightly"
"Overall, this beer is very nice to look at in the glass, but I need something more from this beer, especially if it is going to be priced at $10.99 for a six pack. You fooled me Bells. I would much rather save $3 and get any Saison six pack."
"Drinkability, what can you say? It doesn't really do much of what the best wits do, but by the same token, it isn't exactly bad either. Really don't get the idea of this being a winter seasonal."
"Despite some flaws in concept and execution, the tingle of carbonation and the slight dry finale are reasonably pleasant enough and, although it's never original or exciting, it's a passable wheat beer and definitely capable of heavy consumption."
"CHEERS"
"(D)- A fine witbier. Good taste, body, and balance. No complaints here, just would much rather grab something else than this during winter."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some spices and citrus. Taste is good, light flavors of citrus and spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down with ease. Overall this is a quality beer."
"Drinkability is good. I could swill this stuff all night."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: A little heavier than most wheat beers but very drinkable for the winter months. It has a good weight to it and has a pleasant subtle carbonation to it."
"Poured with literally no head. The pour was an unfiltered orange-yellow typical of a witbier and I was instantly hit by a citrus aroma. Upon the first taste, it became apparent this had little carbonation, though it had a very good citrus and subtle spice flavor. Malty, clean finish. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"D- This was the first time that I have ever had this beer. After looking at other reviews it seems that I may be the only one that thought this beer poured almost completely white in color. Did this year's recipe change or were the tap lines just not very clean? Either way the beer had a decent flavor but it looked more like milk than beer."
"Drinkability: It's a great winter selection. The heavier body certainly distinguishes it from its summer counterparts. Would love to have another."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with barely any white head. Smell is wheat, spice, some citrus. Typical wit smells. Some yeast and banana as well. Taste is wheat, a little bit of citrus. For some reason I'm tasting a fair amount of copper. Some spice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good amount of carbonation. Pretty drinkable. Copper taste subsided after the first couple of sips."
"Drinkability: Loved this beer. Could have it over and over again."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours hazy yellow (mainly) with 1 finger white head. Poor retention and lacing. Smell was strong of yeast, some spice and a little bread. I thought this beer had a unique taste, I think it tasted a little like a spicy hefe. Some banana and bubblegum with some corriander and other spices. Yeast and dry malt as well. Mouthfeel I felt was a little water and slightly undercarbonated. Overall not a great beer but not bad, I should note I'm not a huge Witbier fan though."
"D- i dont think this is one of bell's best beers, buts its not terrible either. just something i wont be trying again anytime soon. thanks to whoever left this at my house, its not something i would have bought/tried otherwise."
"Notes: I enjoyed this more out of the bottle. I wonder if that is due to the bottle fermentation/yeasts in the bottle?"
"D: Great drinkability when fresh. This is a solid witbier, and fits in perfectly with a roasting winter fire."
"The beer is very drinkable - but I am partial to wheat beers. However this beer doesnt really do it for me as a ""winter"" brew. I mean it is very drinkable and good, but this is a brew that can be had on a 90 degree day in the summer. Good beer - just not really what I look for in a winter brew. I think the crispness I am detecting is where the difference is in this and a regular wheat beer. refreshing beer none the less."
"Drinkability: This is an easy sipper that can stand up to a variety of food or would be good on its on while warming up inside, but I think there are some better ones out there. For me, Allagash White dominates this one in every way."
"D: Just not flavorful enough to be worth finishing. I suppose it might be good to wash down a spicy chilli in the winter, but that's about it."
"Drinkability - quite drinkable and good. I'm glad I found this at Blue Max."
"Drinkability- Goes down easy, mild bitterness that goes a long way in terms of taste. Not to much, not to little"
"Pours out a hazy golden color. About two fingers of foamy white head that dissipates rather quickly. A bit of lacing. Smells are of citrus and spice, maybe cinnamon or clove. Taste is citrusy, a bit grainy and wheaty. Mouthfeel is very smooth and crisp, refreshing, I could drink these all night."
"I could easily settle in with a six-pack of Bell's winter offering. I doubt I'll buy any next year, but that's just because there are better wits to be had."
"Poured a hazy straw yellow into a pint glass with a sudsy white head that quickly frothed to a negligible film and left no lacing. Aroma is sour, with orange, spice, coriander, a little clove. Mouthfeel is a little slippery and very spiny with carbonation. Taste is banana, lemon, no tartness from the aroma, slightly grassy, finishing with an odd dry hop bite. Drinkability is moderate due to what is in my opinion a slightly unbalanced hop bitterness. Overall this is an ok beer, nothing more, nothing less."
"This is definitely on the sweet side, which I think is typical for the style, but the sweetness is not overbearing. A tasty beer fairly typical for the style. I could definitely have more than one."
"D - this is a pretty good wit. Nothing stands out or blows me away by it, but nothing disappoints me either. This is a pretty decent wit, but I would reach for something else by Bell's."
"Taste: More fruit and bubblegum. Really mellow and smooth."
"D - Bell's has strayed from typical wits with this offering, but this is still a remarkable beer. Winter White strikes an excellent balance between the thinner, spice-laden wits and the overly chalky, orange-sherbert-like thicker wits. I could put down several of these in no time. A stunning and unique example of the style."
"I thought that Bell's Winter White Ale was a very drinkable beer. The experience from the smell to the aftertaste left in the mouth was not great but above average. I enjoyed the slight but not overdone spicy taste, and would drink the beer again with no problem."
"poured into a small pilsner glass"
"Overall, a good but not great beer. I've loved most Bell's that I've had but this one misses for me. Would like to try again since the store I got it at is a bit questionable on their handling of beers. Had bunch of good ones but a few really off ones as well. Except for the retry, one and done as their are too many other good wits out there."
"d: plenty drinkable over a single, but lacking enough character for a repeat"
"Bell's usually produces very fine products and this one is up to their standards. I will try to get it again some time (so much beer to drink and so little time)."
"This beer smells very sweet malt. The taste follows the smell with sweet malt that makes the back of your tongue curl. Tastes of alcohol come through as well. A warm feeling down into your stomach. Not drinkable at all. This is definitely a one beer in front of a winter fire."
"D= Despite (or maybe because of?) the low carbonation level, this was very drinkable and certainly sesionable."
"I think this would have been a better beer to drink in the summer actually. Not horrible, not great."
"Overall, this is one of my least favorites from Bell's. There really isn't anything to special about this, but it is easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Extremely good. This is not a winter beer, but it should be. This style can be appreciated no matter what the season. I love it."
"Great session beer, perhaps a bit light for some. Most people would probably prefer a warmer to this but nevertheless a nice winter selection from Bell's."
"Drinkability is virtually at your personal limit - this would be a much better summer release at this ABV and in this style."
"It's what inside that counts and Bell's has a winner here."
"D- It's definitely drinkable. But, I'm not sure I'll revisit this one. There are other witbier's and winter ales I prefer."
"M/D - Not really what I was expecting, there didn't seem to be much to this one at all."
"Drinkable for the style and in general. I must say I really don't get this release. this would be a fine beer to have six months from now in 90 degree weather. in chicago tonight its single digits with six inches of snow. why would i want a light crisp refreshing beer with no complexity? i am not trashing wit, i actually love the style - in the summer. still its a good wit. maybe there will be some available in the summer."
"if you like this one, def make sure you check out Elysian Bi Frost"
"A couple of thoughts. This has to be one of the better domestic wit style beers I've ever tasted. However, I think it a bit odd that Bell's has chosen to make this there winter beer. Frankly, I would prefer to see something like this in the Summer time, when I could better appreciate the low alcohol and what I associate as summery flavors. All that being said, this is a very good beer from Bell's."
"ON TAP .A creamy hazy orange color with loads of yeast swimming around,small white fluff head.Aroma is somewhat heffish,with some mild banana,cloves,orange zest,and grassy notes.Flavor is wheaty with loads of banana, bubblegum and and spice, maybe even pineapple. Very drinkable, refreshing after a long days work. Would make a solid summer brew too."
"Overall - This is a great looking beer. It looks just like an orange creamsickle that has been melted in a glass. The flavors are great although the orange, lemon, and banana are little subdued. If the banana and Orange flavors were a little stronger this brew would be euphoric."
"D: I like it, I could possibly have 3 or 4 of these."
"This isn't a bad beer but it's definitely not one of the top witbiers I have tried. Middle of the pack in the Bell's line."
"EDIT - Accidentally reversed my Mouthfeel and Drinkability ratings. Does not effect my score."
"This beer pours a light hazy orange color with a two finger white head that quickly disappears. Smells of citrus upfront and banana at the end. The taste has lots of spice to it with banana, clove, orange and lemon peel. The mouthfeel is a bit too thin for my taste and has lots of carbonation. Drinkability is decent although I couldn't really see myself drinking more than two at a time. Overall a decent offering from Bell's."
"Soft but crisp and clean MF, only slightly buttery. An easy drinker in any season."
"D- Kind of an odd style selection for a US winter ale, but still pretty tasty."
"mouth is heavy with yeast, I can't even speak about this beer, it's just horrible. I'm pouring it down the drain."
"This was pleasant, nothing too fancy, but light, tasty and drinkable."
"I've seen some critiques of this beer that ding it for being atypical with respect to winter styles. I don't recall seeing a rule that a white ale could not be a winter beer. This kind of innovation in the winter line is very welcome. Sort of an, um, winter welcome."
"12oz bottle. Batch 8780. Served in a shaker pint. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy straw with a finger of fine bubbled white head. Yeasty, spicy aroma with some wheaty malt. Light bodied, slick mouthfeel. More spice in the flavor. Complex clove finish. Very refreshing and drinkable. I don't know why they bring this out in the winter. It would be a perfect summer time beer."
"D-Would never buy this again I stopped drinking wheats long ago and have no reason to pay 13 bucks for one."
"D: This one tastes pretty decent, but what makes it a winter beer, exactly? The mouthfeel especially seems off - too much like club soda and without the creamy texture you'd expect from a witbier."
"I might be being a bit unfair to the style I'm sure, as lighter beers generally don't satisfy me as much. I've liked bell's other beers and so I picked one of these up on a whim."
"D- light and easy drinking with mellow flavors, its odd drinking a winter brew that i normally associate with summer."
"D: Impressive drinkability. Unusual style for a winter offering, although I could see a Witbier like this being especially refreshing after a day on the slopes. (See winter wonderland on label.)"
"Notes from 7/20/05"
"I was very surprised to see that Bell's releases this as a winter seasonal as I typically don't associate wits with cold weather. Kudos for trying something different I guess though."
"Strong Ale, Imperial Stout, Spiced Ale...what's this? A winter witbier seasonal? Brilliant! Just what I needed as a break from all these big heavy winter brews. Beautiful label makes me wish the sun was out over a freshly fallen 12"" snow. Heavy wheat aroma with citrus, clove, and a touch of banana. Rich yellow pour, slightly golden in the middle. Solid white head, swirl the yeast and a nice cloudiness cascades through to the bottom. Lively on the palate there is a welcoming sourness at the end. Flavor is easily received. Modest blend of fruits and spices, the banana is more prevalent. High wheat content, nice maltiness. Flavors are a little more calm than some of the other witbiers around but they are very well blended. Exceptional winter surprise, nice treat."
"Drinkability: I like this beer a lot more than I thought I would. It's very drinkable, so much so that I could consider buying a whole sixer of these. Possibly my favorite wit, something I wouldn't have expected from an American-made beer."
"Drinkability: Could have a couple of these with ease, even though I've tasted better versions of this style. Its not bad."
"put an orange slice in there, not a good sign."
"A touch too sweet but very drinkable witbier from Bell's."
"D--Typical I suppose."
"D - This is a pretty good wit. I really liked the blend of fruity flavors with some spice and licorice flavors."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly good witbier - probably one of my higher rated ones, really. Has all the right elements and hits all the right notes without being too subdued or dull. Expertly balanced, and recommended, upside-down label or otherwise."
"M + D: Nice and dry, which is a positive. Without the sweet and spicy flavours of some, it becomes a very easy drinker. I'll be looking forward to the next release of this one to try it a little hotter."
"M/D: Think body, good carbonation level and highly drinkable. Not sure why this is a winter beer as it seems perfect for summer, but overall a very good beer and one that I will definately be picking up again."
"D- I think it is decent but nothing outstanding. I'm not sure how old this beer is so not sure if it is past its prime. I would think its a few months passed it's peak and starting to show signs of oxidation."
"T: Not sure how this ends up being a winter seasonal, tastes like an adequate wit, lots of banana flavor, with spiciness from pepper and coriander dialed up. Medium body with a lot of carbonation. Adequate beer, but not my favorite from Bell's or favorite Wit."
"On tap at the local hang out. Poured with a nice cloudy body and slight head. Aroma was nice with a definte Belgian tonality. Flavor was a bit disappointing in that it was a bit too direct on the Belgain profile of fruit. Pleasant mouthfeel as it is very drinkable and well balanced. A good recommendation for the Oberon fans that get too much of the Michigan winters and long for their ""fix""--addicts! hee hee"
"Pours a very cloudy, bright yellow with a big puffy white head that dissipated gradually leaving little lacing. Smell is dominated by sweet aromas of wheat, lemons, oranges and bananas. Big spice aroma as well dominated by cloves and coriander. Taste is primarily the big sweet wheat up front with the fruits right behind. Lemony hops are also present. The mouthfeel is light and slick with heavy carbonation. This is a decent wit and very drinkable though not the most complex wit I've tasted."
"This beer has potential, but is too unbalanced for me. For those who like bannanas a lot, it would be a winner."
"I just curious as to why this is a winter seasonal when its soo refreshing. Whos knows maybe oberon just won a coin toss. Regardless, this beer is worth checking out."
"Good drinkability although I may or may not drink more depending on whats on tap. Session beer for some although probably not for me. A good beer that I would definately rate above average."
"The taste is exactly what a wit should be. Some banana and an extra kick of spice. It really goes down easily. I have no clue why this is categorized as a winter beer (maybe the extra spiciness?) but it's perfectly suited to sitting outside on a nice day. I guess that makes it a pretty flexible beer. Another winner from Bell's."
"If Bell's labels this as a white ale, I would love to try their hefe, cuz this is a good hefe of it's own right. First Bell's I've had and it's excellent. Believe the hype!!"
"Bell's Winter White is a pretty good brew if you can get past the absurd yeast in the nose. Not my favorite Wit, but, like most of Bell's brews, it's solid."
"Medium to full body for style, there's of course lots of carbonation but it seems to work out quite well. I won't have a bit of a problem finish 6 of these."
"I've always wondered why Bell's goes with a Witbier for their Winter beer (that's why I waited for the weather to warm a bit before getting into this)? In any case though, while this isn't the strongest beer from them by any means, it is still pretty tasty and at 4.5%, very sessionable."
"Overall a good bottle-conditioned beer, I actually had two in one sitting. Very enjoyable but I don't think it is a very good example of a witbier. Definitely sweet enough to be a triple."
"D- Overall, I prefer the batch 8000 for bells witbiers, and to be honest, would rather grab another witbier as this isn't anything special."
"Pours a clear, pale bright yellow with a quickly dissipating head. Smell is citrusy with hints of bread and banana. Taste is heavy on the bread with some lemon, spice, and the slightest touch of banana. Mouthfeel is fine - crisp and moderate. A tasty winter ale - a nice change of pace from all of the heavy stouts I usually drink during the cold months. Recommended."
"The mouthfeel, although I usually mix it in with the taste, deserves a special mention here. There is something plush and velvety about this that makes me want to sip and chew a couple just for the sake of enjoyment."
"It poured a cloudy golden almost orange color. The aroma of this beer has hints of sweet citrus and bananas and some Belgium candy sugar. The taste of this beer was similar to smell hints of sweet sugars and citrus and banana notes were also present. This drinkable beer was smooth but had a slightly bitter after taste. Overall this was an average winter beer."
"Nice creamy, chewy feel to this one I could have a few of these, but admitingly I am not sure about a wit in the winter, but it is a good beer."
"D- Very nice and easy drinking."
"Came slightly cloudy gold with not too much head. Had a pinch of banana smell to it. Had some orangish hints in there too. Taste was kinda like bananas in the background too. little bit of spice as well as a light malty finish. Medium to light mouth feel. Very drinkable in my opinion because its a great brew and a lower ABV. Recommended."
"D: Solid American take on the belgian witbier.."
"It's a good beer for winter. I think my review may have been biased because I like IPAs and APAs so much. this isn't my favorite style of beer, but I'm beginning to appreciate it more and more."
"Well given the reviews and what I'd heard, this one was actually better than expected. Poured an opaque whitish-copper color with a thin white head on top. Looked solid, although no lacing. Nose was strong on citrus, wheat, and coriander, as you might expect. Quite pungent. Taste was likewise, although a little muted, particularly by the too strong carbonation. Overall, this one wasn't bad, one I'd have every once in a while. They just need to tone down the carbonation to make it a little more drinkable."
"D-Not my favorite style, but well worth the try. Another nice delivery from Bell's. Also, this one grows on you."
"Poured from the tap a hazy lighter yellow with some peach colored hue a thin quick to fade head atop.Toasted wheat clove and some bannana reminisentmore of a Bavarian style sheat than a Belgian white in my mind.Pretty standard wheat flavors somewhat clovey and toasty with a faint hint of citrus in the back end.Decent and basic beer, my wife would enjoy this, me well I thought it was ok."
"I have to say this is one of the best beers i have ever had. Hoeg used to my favorite witbier but this one tops it. I love it. I will def get a sixer of this if i can find it in my area."
"Poured into a pint glass and was presented with a light, slightly seethru oragish body with a one-finger head that quickly died (note: shake those last few sips because this beer will leave some yeast floaters if you don't). The smell was nice and floral with some citrus, especially orange and lemon, coming out but nothing major. The taste is rather a letdown. as tjere really isn't anything there except a combo of wheat/yeast with a sharp lemony feel. The excessive wheat/yeast makes a real smooth but somewhat watery, slick brew that feels a little non-descript as it passes (a tad like a light beer). I could pond a few of these easily, but I won't be actively seeking this winter beer and as far as winter beers go it is a tad weak."
"Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. One and a half finger head that quickly dissipated. Not quite what I was expecting from a white. Aroma contained cloves, citrus and wheat, nothing overpowering. Taste pretty much matched the aroma. While the mouthfeel was full and thirst-quenching, the swallow of the beer seemed thin and left a lemon water after-taste. Overall, not a bad brew, but nothing outstanding. It was nice to mix things up with a white during this never-ending Michigan winter, but I think I'd prefer this in the summer."
"I do like the Witbiers, so it's one style that I particularly look for. This one isn't the greatest I've had, but it's still good. I think the highlight for this beer was the appearance. When I poured it, it had a nice fluffy white head that quickly died down to a thick laceing. The taste was ok, but I think it would be better with a slice of orange."
"Its not my favorite style, but I could drink alot of these on warm arizona days, and epecially since it is only 5%."
"This is one of the less impressive Bell's beers I've had....could be a bad bottle also though...or that i'm just not in the mood for this style in february"
"Another good beer from Bells! I wasn't expecting much but was quite impressed with the thick creamy yellow look after being poured into a pint glass. A strong effervescence of wheat in the smell. This beer tingles the mouth with a strong thick mix of carbonation and wheat but has more of the feel of a summer relaxing in the sun beer than that of a winter. Drinkability was a little hindered by the mouthful of wheat flavor; perhaps a little too much but this is a beer I will buy again."
"M&D: Light & crisp. Mostly smooth drinkability. The carbonation was medium to light and matched very well with the style. Overall a very nice beer and refreshing for a winter ale."
"Bell's Winter White poured a light cloudy orange-yellow-brown. The aroma was slightly citrusy and fruity. Really has a nice citrusy smell. The palate appeared to be pretty smooth...a very clean taste with a hint of citrus. The aftertaste was pretty decent as well."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is good. It's smooth and crisp. Hard to believe this is a winter beer. Overall, it's a pretty good offering. Might be better during the summer, but I'm not holding that against it."
"While this is not a style I seek out, I would highly recommend this flavorful, sessionable ale as a respite from winter."
"Now I know they're calling this a winter beer, but for the style there isn't a crisp mouthfeel like you expect in a wit. Instead it's more on par with the medium body of an American amber. I guess if you're looking for a wit to warm you in the winter, this is your beer."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a fruity yeast aroma. It's refreshingly crisp with a nice citrus element. The taste is great. It has a very smooth wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a citrus edge. The yeast provides excellent character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good wit. It's light and refreshing; a nice twist on a winter seasonal."
"The drinkability is very good this is not a great style for me but I am enjoying this one. Prosit, MK"
"D: Nothing objectionable but not a home run or even a double. Bell's is a great brewery on the whole, but this isn't one of their best. Solid but under the bar for Bell's."
"Think a slight heartier and well, winter version of the Oberon in the flavor. Little bit more of a Hefe slant. It's sparkly though a bit more bready and a ginger thing not noticed as much in an Obie. A little too lemony and coriander for what I prefer in an winter beer. A creamy banana thing on the back of the throat in the finish. Good but it just doesn't seem all that wintery. Early spring or late fall maybe. Quality recipe and very drinkable stuff but nothing all that exciting. Oberon lost it's charm for me awhile back (but was more than a passing fancy in my heyday with it) and this just doesn't seem all that different or special to me."
"It finishes a bit dry and grainy. Reminded me of bread. Bell's managed to make an interesting twist on the style."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good mild beer to drink several of over the course of an evening."
"The beer pours a hazy gold with a sturdy white head of foam. The yeast was strongly stuck to the bottom of the bottle, and a lot of swirling was required to get them in the glass. The aroma is quite sweet and slightly citrusy. There is little orange character to this beer's flavor, but quite a bit of bitterness from the coriander. Mouthfeel is exceptional, enough to remind you that you're not drinking water, but not to overpowering. The carbonation is spot on too. A good beer for the winter or anytime."
"D- What I like most about this beer is that it is a winter seasonal. That makes it unique for the style. It fills the gap for a nice, light, sessionable, winter brew. Aside from that it doesn't stand out as an exceptional wit-but its still a pretty good one."
"A delicious hefeweizen crossed with belgian yeast, I typically do not like american hefeweizens (perhaps I haven't tried enough) but this one was a pleasant surprise with the scent of clove and banana nut bread, starts off sweet in the mouth with a hint of mild bitterness after swallowing, delicious. What a great twist to use belgian yeast yet not over doing the flavor keeping the delicate balance and mouth-feel that a good hefeweizen should have..."
"A yellowy gold appearance with decent head. Smells like many other wheats I've had. And the taste is very similar also. That smell and taste is bananas and cloves. Somehow the yeast (which was detectable also) creates that flavor. I like it. Good beer. Very easy to drink."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow with thin white head that fades fast, no lacing. Smells very yeasty, with bread dough and biscuits, honey, and lemon with some spice like coriander. Tastes of sweet wheat mixed with coriander with a nice citrus balance. Medium in body with nice carbonation and a crisp finish. With a good balance and nice fresh sweet wheat flavor, it's a very drinkable beer, not so sure about it being that good for the Winter season though, unless it's supposed to make us believe Spring is right around the corner."
"D_I am fairly impressed with this one. It is well balanced with the spices and fruit. Surprisingly good for an US witbier, though I have come to expect as much from Bell's. I also like how they buck the trend and release a 4.5%witbier as their winter seasonal."
"The taste again is dominated by spices such as cloves and ginger with a bit of citrus thrown in. A nice blend. The body feels light and is not a bit cloying. Very clean finish. A good beer but not a winter one. It is also not one I would make a session out of as the spice would be a little much to me after two."
"For most brewers this would just be a pretty pedestrian beer, but given that it's from Bell's it's a disappointment. Not a bad brew, but a boring one. Bell's can do so much better."
"Pours a gorgeous peachy haze with decent ghost white head. The nose is of banana and spice, wheats. The taste is very wheaty with good subtle and smooth bananaish flavors with little spice, but its present. Mouthfeel is good, but nothing special. very drinkable and a great session brew. another good one from bells. go bells."
"D- Pleasantly surprising witbier with a nice amount of flavor and texture, the whole tasting experience is better than the sum of its parts, would love to try this against some other witbiers. . ."
"D - Pretty good I guess, better than most in the style I think. If this is your style, however, seek it out. Recommended for fans of the style or of Bell's."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp at first, but has a bit of soapy after taste. This is very light and sessionable. I don't know. I guess I don't think it's ""special"" enough to really be a great seasonal, but it could be a fairly descent standard beer."
"D - Super easy to drink and well-balanced wheat beer. A bit heavy on the carbonation, but very flavorable nonetheless."
"Are there better, more complex wits out there? Absolutely. But this one is very very solid. My opinion, stock up near March and enjoy during the summer months as well."
"Pours a cloudy orange yellow. No head visible. Nose is a lot of citrus and a yeasty funk. Flavor is very true (in its own way) to a witbier. Nice spicy and yeasty tones. Seems a bit too vibrant, but not so much that it kills the whole experience. Standard feel for the mouth with a bit of a lower carbonation. I think this is a very nice witbier. Sure it is American produced, but it could stand up against others from across the pond."
"This is a pretty darn good beer."
"This is a fine example of the style. In a style that is all to often represented by beers that are somewhat watered down, this one has a depth of flavor that sets it apart from the pack. It provides a refreshing alternative to the typically heavier beers of winter. I would certainly have another."
"I would drink this in the summer over even their Oberon, I believe. Light ABV, non-aggressive flavor, just cut the citrus notes and this one would be out of the park."
"Body is slick and slippery and just a little too big for a Witte. There are big, loose bubbles when the beer is poured, but the carbonation quickly leaves the beer. My last few gulps were nearly flat. Like any Witte, drinkability is still good. Would be a better Summer release."
"I am not crazy about this beer. It's a nice change of pace from some of the heavier, over-spiced winter warmers out there, but on the whole it just doesn't do anything to inspire. I might even prefer to drink this beer in the summer, as it would definitely quench a hot summer thirst more than keep me warm in the winter. I like that Bell's is trying new things, but this might be better off being brewed with some wheat and re-packaged as a hefe-weizen. Just a thought."
"D - Good beer. Drink up."
"Overall Impression: A really tasty brew. The Belgian yeast element is the strongest taste, if you like Belgians, youll like this."
"A hazy butterscotch color, and a surprising fast dying white head. Some bubblegum, clove and nutmeg in the aroma, but hard to find. A juicy sweet orange start, with winter spices and a nice hop pop to balance it out, Its just not as strong with the flavors as I would have liked it to be."
"Nothing really separated this from a regular wheat beer except for the slight orange taste, I guess I expected a lot more from Bell's."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and has an excellent carbonation. Outstanding beer!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow/ pale orange color with a white head. In the aroma, wheaty, orange citrus, and corriander. In the taste, kind of watery for a wit and hints of corriander. A small bite, but overall smooth mouthfeel, with a dry, small bitter corriandr aftertaste. Light and easy, good all around, except for somewhat watery in the taste."
"This isn't a style I would usually seek out on my own. Hefes turned me off of wheat beers in my earlier craft days but I later realized it was the banana/clove I didn't care for. Now I'm not afraid of wheat and I must say I found this beer to be pretty good. It was crisp and refreshing. It seems like kind of an odd choice for a winter seasonal, spring would probably be more appropriate."
"Pours an almost bright golden yellow color with a thin layer of white head that slowly dies down. Smell is of spice and coriander with some orange peel as well. Taste is a muted version of the aroma, and the mouthfeeling is nicely crisp in carbonation. This one reminded me of a winter wheat version of Oberon."
"Drinkability? You could drink it all night...but why would you. This, especially coming from Bell's is a disappointing beer. I don't see how this is a winter ale (when i let my roomate sample this he remarked that it 'tasted like something we had in the summer'), nor a white ale. Nor a Bell's beer. This beer leaves me confused, about most things except my liking for this beer. Which is almost non-existent. It even starts to look like Tang after awhile. I'm almost afraid to write this, but I kind of like Tang more. Blah."
"D'ability - not too different from a regular hefe-weizen, and as drinkable as one of those. Didn't realize it was a 4.5% ABV witbier while drinking - honestly thought it was a stronger, more typical holiday type beer."
"The beer was fruity tasting and almost salty with a hint of oranges or something. Though the beer was drinkable I just did not care for it that much and will not buy again."
"overall, this is not a bad beer to have around, not typically a winter seasonal but still nice"
"Overall, this is a nice beer. However, I would not put this beer up with my favorite belgian style white ales."
"Very drinkable, in that I could drink a case of it and keep on going (okay maybe that's pushing it), but overall, i was rather disappointed. I've had better from Bell's."
"-Oelergud"
"Not bad, but nothing impressive either. If you like White Ales (Witbiers) you will probably enjoy this. Recommended."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a chalice. The beer poured a hazy orange/yellow with a very thin white head that left no lacing. The beer actually looked like a pulpless grapefruit juice. The aroma was of ripe apples and bananas. The taste is of wheat and bananas. It leaves a yeasty aftertaste in your mouth that I didnt much care for. The mouthfeel is decent, medium bodied with little carbonation. Not a bad beer, just nothing exciting to talk about."
"D = Could stand as a session beer, but probably better for taking a taste and moving on to something more savory."
"D- a solid beer, and the best choice at the bar that night."
"Overall- It's a solid beer, something different from most winter offerings, and a nice change-up. I did my review without swirling the sediment and again when swirling. I didn't see any major differences. Everything just seemed slightly amplified with a swirl."
"Mouthfeel was light with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkabilty was high if you like wheat beers. Not really my favorite style to drink in the winter. Feels like more of a summer beer except for the spices."
"D- Different for sure. Not exactly what I would think of on a really cold day outside- but it's good to know this will be at the Eccentric Cafe throughout the winter if I am in the mood for something a little different and lighter."
"The beer pours a very hazy cloudy orange hue with a very thin white head of lace. The scent is dominated by the wheat in this beer. That is honesty all I could smell for the first few drinks and then finally the bouquet opened up a little bit. I got some coriander and slight citrus notes. The flavor profile is rather unique. Blasted upfront with the sweetness of wheat followed up by a slightly bitter touch of hops on the finish. Very well balanced and kept me wanting another sip. The mouthfeel is what I wasn't a fan of on this beer. Very thin and didn't coat very well at all. The carbination is just a little to much. For my tastes I wish it was backed off just a little bit. The drinkability overall is very good for this beer, and I would order this if I saw it on tap near me."
"I have always liked this beer and it finds a place in my fridge...when in season of course"
"Smell is really amazing. Spicy and such, love it. Taste, however, is one of the bigger disappointments i have had with beer (not to the level of SA Triple bock, but still disappointing). Taste is fairly flat, not getting much citrus or spice, but it does taste a bit sour and leaves a bad aftertaste. mouthfeel is creamy and enjoyable but it needs more carbonation as it was quite flat. Drinkability suffers from the sourness and lack of carbonation."
"An easy drinking beer. More suited for a hot summer afternoon than a cold autumn day."
"Hazy light orange/peach with a thin gauzy head that disappeared quite quickly. Faint citrus and coriander on the nose.Fine but prickly carbonation brings a lemon-orange and coriander flavor to the front. Light, fresh dough malt middle with medium-light body. Finishes slightly yeasty. This is basically Oberon that actually has the spices in it that so many people pretend they can taste in that AMERICAN WHEAT style summer brew. I fail to see what is so wintery about this. But it is a really fine Belgian Witbier."
"Overall this a very nice and interesting wheat beer. Even though I am having it in the summer it's very tasty and uncommon. It reminds me of a cross between the German and Belgian wheat styles."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/golden, one finger bone white head forms, settles down to a thin ring pretty soon, no lacing. Smell is malty, some wheat, sweet, clove, banana, citrus, touch of yeast. Taste is malty, bit lemony, vanilla and banana, bit of spice, bready yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, pretty smooth, moderately refreshing, pretty mediocre example of a witbier though. Thanks Lexx!"
"D: At first I was a bit turned off by the flavor of this beer but the more tasting I gave it the more I appreciated it. With a complex flavors and aromas I have come to enjoy this. Makes a fine seasonal brew for sitting by the fire in the middle of winter. But it's great in the summer too."
"D: Good session beer. I would drink on occasion."
"Smooth with some texture. A starchy thickness. A bit of tight carbonation throughout. A bit disappointing due to the fact that I absolutely love virtually every other beer Bell's makes."
"I guess I don't usually see this style called a winter ale... Seems more like a spring/summer offering, but that doesn't matter too much. Overall a decent witbier."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured extremely cloudy whitish/yellow color ale with a nice small pure white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of medium wheat with some very subtle spice note. Taste is lighter then expected with some wheat but no bubblegum notes that I usually appreciated in an hefeweizen and some very subtle spices and therefore no coriander that I usually like in my witbier. It appears that by mixing those two I am not getting the best of both word. This is probably one of the weakest offering from this fine brewer."
"Mouthfeel is sort of dry and bread-like, pretty refreshing despite low carbonation."
"This is a good session beer and would be a great choice for having one with some seafood."
"D - It's okay. Not bad, not super great though. Reminded me a little bit of Duvel, but with half the taste and half the alcohol."
"All-in-all, I guess I'd recommend it, but not my favorite wit."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into a shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a cloudy golden color with about a finger of fluffy white head. Slight lacing left on the inside of the glass. Smell is spicy and herbal along with a faint sweetness. Tastes of mild peppery spice, yeast, citrus and wheat. A little bit thin in body with medium carbonation. I was expecting more out of this one."
"d: This is an average Witbier."
"Overall this is definately a witbier, but not really a ""winter white"". I can see what Bell's was going for here, but this beer is really an answer to a question no one asked."
"D: I have to say that this is not what I was expecting with a ""Winter White Ale."" The ABV is low and the sharp wheat flavors make this a better summer brew. Solid, but a step below some other Witbiers, like GLBC's Holy Moses"
"The taste doesn't wake up my mouth by any means. Hints of spice and bread. It's almost like Bell's tried going belgium with this beer but stopped short. Mouthfeel is under-carbonated, smooth, yet a bit bland in its smoothness. A slight aftertaste lingers for a while, but not long. All in all, this white lacks complexity and taste. I expected a bit more from the good brewer's at Bell's."
"I drank this too fast. By all means it was nothing close to exceptional but I enjoyed it just find while watching the snow fall and coat the streets in white."
"I enjoyed this one. It was almost a nice bit of summer in a land of winter warmers and stouts."
"Pale in color, with a light haze. Very little head. Smells more like a hefeweizen than a witbeer, with banana and clove overtones sticking out. A tasty beer, crisp and smooth with banana and clove like the smell, and some light malty sweetness. Not a lot of hop flavor. Nicely drinkable; wouldn't mind kicking a few of these back in front of the fire on a cold winter night."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7760 (bottled on 12/13/06). It pours an opaque yellowed orange with two fingers of white head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is lightly tart with a good wheat presence, straw, and hints of orange, with mostly just wheat on the palate, yet still tastes quite nice. The body is a bit creamy and fairly full for a wheat beer, with medium carbonation and finish. Overall a well-structured wheat beer that is quite drinkable, as it was gone before I even knew it."
"Thanks for sending this JohnnyM2002."
"Very hazy, pale straw color and a creamy white head with good retention and excellent lacing to the bottom. Mellow nose of yeasty bread, banana peel, light citrus, and a little grassy. Starts off with a limey, sprucey spritz and quickly moves to a nice soft wheat profile that is flavorful and mellow. Medium carbonation makes for a tonic water effect. Descent spice level and some fruity hops are very complimentary. Chalky to creamy at times. The smooth soft profile makes this and easy drinker although Im not buying the winter connection."
"This straw-colored, hazy beer poured into the glass and left very little retention. A strong smell of complex spices came through in the nose, but left a bit to be desired in the taste. Honestly, this tastes like a good tripel with a couple ounces of water mixed in. The watery texture dominates the mouthfeel. Interesting for a winter brew... definitely drinkable but nothing spectacular."
"Batch 7760. Never had a witbeir as a winter seasonal before, so this should be interesting. Poured a hazy diluted orange with no head whatsoever. Smell was somewhat more complex than many witbeirs, some spices present. Has some spice present in the taste. Almost like a witbeir impersonating a more heavy, darker winter warmer, just not doing a very good job at it. Definitely not as light as some wits. Mouthfeel is a little heavier than I'm used to in this style, I guess this works since it is a winter beer. Somewhat drinkable, but I'm glad I only bought one bottle."
"drinkable, warming, and refreshing after leaning heavily on the darker, higher-octane beers during the cold months."
"Heres a hazy, pale yellow-colored liquid. The head is unfortunately flat. Minimal to non-existent lace. The aroma is a refreshing mix of pepper, lemon, sweet spices, baking bread, melons, and bananna. The taste has a lot of citrus and yeast, along with a little spice. Its a moderately sweet, but very spritzy and carbonated beer. With a fairly medium body, this is actually a little more full than necessary for the style. The finish is a little tart and palate-cleansing. All in all, this isnt my choice for a winter beer, but its decent despite a few flaws."
"Its surprising to see this style released as a winter seasonal, but it certainly isnt unwelcomed. Its not the most refined wit out there, but its earthy while still being light enough and pretty drinkable. Recommended."
"Flavors include bubblegum, banana bread, and a surprisingly robust hop flavor. Mouthfeel is near perfect with delicate and full bodied sensations both in the same sip. This is a very good, authentic tasting witbier that is welcome at my home any time of year, winter or summer."
"This is a fabulous wit beer, but why, why in the hell would they ever promote this as a winter beer. I will buy this if I see it in spring, but never in winter again. This is a definite summer brew and a good one at that. Nice head and lacing, great oft wheat and fruity flavors and a more than medium body. A nice offering, just don't tell us to except this as a winter brew, this is definitely a summer brew."
"Very easy to drink. Thank goodness I only had one from a friend ... otherwise I could have easily plowed through a twelver on my own. It's that tasty. Thank you Mr. Larry Bell!"
"Drinkability: Not a classic wit as I understand it is brewed without spices, this is nevertheless a tasty wheat beer that has elements of a wit and a hefe; nice job"
"D: As I said above. It's simple, it's easy, and it's good drinkin'."
"This brew has a lighter sprity body and is quite refreshing. High carbonation give life to this brew's body and compliment the flavor. The only beef I've with this brew is that it is a winter seasonal. This isn't the type of brew I want to drink in the winter. Were it released in the summer months I can assure you I'd probably buy it again. Becasue its released now, when I want something heavy and hearty I doubt I'll buy this again anytime soon. Other than that its a great brew, not quite up there with Hoegaarden though."
"D---A little disappointing flavor wise but Im happy I got to try it."
"M&D - spicy, a little overspiced, but still very good, the lemon zest enhances the drinkability, a good witbier, wht else would you expect from Bells."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a decent white head and no lacing. Smell is nice- classic wit beer with banana, clove, and bubblegum aromas along with a hint of spice. Taste is a little restrained, doesn't really wow me. Some nice bubblrgum flavors on the finish are especially noticeable as well as hints of clove, maybe some coriander and a slight hint of bitterness that runs through the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth but a little thin. Could use a little more body and carbonation. Fairly nice, but not my first choice."
"My only real complaint about this beer is the limited availability of it. It'd be amazing to knock these back in the middle of July."
"I'd put this wit up against any other out there, including whirlwind and St. Berny's wit. Fantastic beer overall, but I have to wonder, why is this a winter seasonal? Nothing about this beer says ""winter"" to me. While it is a damn fine beer, I'd much rather see bell's release this as the ""Fourth of July White Ale"". I guess I just don't understand the wit beer as a winter beer. Damn fine beer, just not the right time of year. In any case, it is definitely worth picking up... highly recommended."
"Pours like a classic Wit: opaque, pale golden and whitish in color, and with plenty of suspended yeast. Slight pale tan-head and lacing. Nose is right on style, mildly spicy, but rather perfumey, with yeast, clove, and bubblegum qualities, all of which make a great impact on the first sip. Mouthfeel is light and creamy, almost effortless to drink, and with very low apparent alcohol. Juicy and malty (yet light), and very flavorful, this reminds me very favorably of the Saint Bernardus Wit. Wonderful stuff, and a totally unexpected approach to a Winter seasonal. The first time I was served this it was accidentally, during a rush at a local bar. I asked for a Summit Winter and I got a Bell's Winter. I drank it without knowing what it was, partly figuring that (it being a game day) I wouldn't get another beer before long. This particular bar serves a lot of draught Blue Moon, so I mistook it for that right away, but then realized how much *better* it was than the Blue Moon I've had umpteen times in the past! For five seconds I was thinking of re-appraising my view of Blue Moon! Fine job Larry Bell . . . this would be great in 12 packs in summer . . . hey, a guy can dream right?"
"Drank this from a bottle in batch 7735, packaged on November 27, 2006. Pours a hazy tawny orange. Smells of wheat, yeast, and citrus: orange and lemon. Taste begins with mainly the yeast, continues into the citrus flavors - orange and lemon again, especially the orange - and ends with a light touch of the sour citrus. Flavors travel well. Very light, fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, a very good wheat beer. I'm usually not a fan of the style, but this one makes me like it. A nice, clean ale that seems appropriate for the winter."
"It poured a slight golden yellow with a smallish finely bubbled head. Little to no aroma, maybe a very faint biscuit, not sweet at all, no esters. I tastes creamy with no hop taste of aroma. The flavor is very bland, a shocking lack of complexity from what I expect from Bells. Finishes very smooth, very drinkable, and very much lacking in flavor."
"pours out a hazy shade of gold. thin fizzy head dies quickly. minimal lacing present. spicy aroma, some pepper and clove, wheat and yeast. nice tangy flavours...orange and tangerine...some spice...and underlying malt sweetness which lifts the whole beer up and even gives it some gumption. the body is fullish and the mouthfeel is slippery; bordering on syrupy. drinkability rates high just because this tastes good and makes for a great thirst quencher. a nice changeup from the usual winter offerings."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Hazy yellow/amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Hoppy/yeasty nose. Starts with a hoppy/citrusy flavor, dry hoppy finish. Batch #7195, $1.79 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"This is a decent beer, but nothing too special. It just feels weird to drink this in the middle of winter."
"Hazy, somewhat muted golden color. Fluffy white head. Nice, crisp and phenolic aroma. Bright, crisp flavor. Slightly spicy. Nice balance of wheat and malt with the bitterness. Good body-light with a nice dry finish. Very drinkable beer. Not a wit beer fan but I could see doing a bunch of these in the summer. Another good beer from Bell's."
"I don't quite get the Winter White. It's too aggressive for your average wit. It's kind of like a winter Oberon, but doesn't hit the mark for this BA. Bell's is one of the best breweries around, but this isn't a product I'd recommend."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty easy drinking beer. It doesn't have a high alcohol content so I could probably drink a couple of these. The sweet taste can be a bit of a turn off though."
"12 ounce bottle."
"This beer is just a flavor notch up from making my shit list. This is the only disappointment I have ever had from Bells and it's a big one. It's just a step up from macro lager but considerably more expensive. A definite pass in my opinion."
"Hell yeah. I always like spicy wheat beers more on cold days than on hot ones. This is a great idea and a wonderfully brewed beer."
"What happened Bell's???"
"session brew too."
"D: I hate to say it, but this is my least favorite Bell's brew, by far. There is nothing that makes this a winter ale."
"Not my favorite bells beer."
"The body is fairly creamy. Could be much more drinkable. Kind of an odd style for a winter release, though I can see how the ""white"" would be associated with the season."
"Verdict: easily overlooked gem by Bell's. You think winter, you think dark usually, but I have spent a couple evenings at bonfires while snow was falling drinking this beer. They seemed to disappear too fast."
"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy yellow color with a soapy looking head. The smell reminds me very much of Bell's Sparkling Ale, with slightly less nose and perhaps a touch more banana smell, spicy. The taste is initially bitter, with a nice coriander and clovey finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with chewy carbonation. Overall, this is definitely a drinkable beer; I was surprised by the similarity to this and their sparkling ale... the sparkling ale being the more intense version."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a pretty interesting yeasty wheat beer, bold in flavor, although oddly bitter."
"D - OK, so I have to admit it's a little refreshing after drinking a different winter stout everyday. I'll keep it as an occasional winter beer, though, as to not tire myself of it. Maybe I'll try one in July and see how it tastes."
"D - Definitely drinkable, but it's not really nuanced. I'm puzzled as to why this is a winter seasonal...I would drink this in the summed if available."
"Not exactly the winter warmer I would have expected, not many spices or strong taste in any way, but it is still rather pleasant served ice cold."
"Quite drinkable, limited mainly by the lack of flavor depths here, this is a nice refresher after my morning bike ride, but it seems more suited to a warm, sunny day."
"Taste- The flavors is more akin to an American wheat, but with hints of Belgian wits too. A nice carbonated mostly wheat mix of crystal malts. Gives off light fruity flavors like bananas. Then some orange peel and anise."
"Pours pale golden, clouded by the yeast pour. Soapy one finger head with poor retention and no lacing. Coriander and clove nose, with a faint aroma of bitter orange peel and some wheat in the background. Pale malt and wheat sweetness upfront, followed by a wave of orange rind and coriander. Clove-like yeast flavor in the aftertaste, balance is level without any noticable hop bitterness. Crisp, medium carbonation and the unfilted texture gives it a smooth medium body. Lots of spice flavor in the finish, but comfortably drinkable for sure."
"The body is a little high for a wit or even a wheat, and no carbonation. Overall the wheat is limited and the spice note are not where they should be but clean yeast and easy drinkabiliy."
"Wounderful to look, this pour has a gradation from light lemon yellow to tangerine orange, like a slice of a citrus rainbow glowing from the glass. Its overwhelming bouquet suggested a promising bursted of falvor in the mouth. First sip hits with a full force of lemon zest, however like lemon zest, it quicks shows its bitter and oily backside, never showing a greater depth of spice. Very quaffable, yet almost unpleasantly polite."
"Attractive color of diluted tang. Far too gentle aroma and very spiratic. Hints of coriander, light wheat, dried apricot, clove and spice. Again, very subtle in the flavor. Tingling spicing but not enough. Notes of banana peel, peach and light wheat. Shows weiss and white style. An average American wheat but I expected more from Bells."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I think this winter wheat would be good in the summer time as well. If oberon were the orang juice of beers, winter wheat would be the orang julius."
"Served a little on cold side a nice aroma of wheat, coriander,orange and citrus zest combine with hints of clove and vanilla. Flavor follows with coriander, ginger, clove. Medium body with a round mouthfeel that provides a solid wheat canvas for broad brush strokes from the citrus, orange, and other spices. Finishes clean after a breif cameo of yeast, wheat, and juicy spices. Bittering hops are perfect. Although 0.3 % lower than Oberon's ABV this seems more substantial. Seek it out. If you can get it for $1 per glass enjoy your session!"
"a bottle brought back from bell's general store. a very cloudy orange beer that its one of the most opaque non-dark beers ive seen. looked even cloudier on tap at the brewpub. extreme yeast sediment in the bottle. smells nice....wheaty and sour. taste is wheaty and sour with some spiced elements (im bad about identifying which ones but im sure tehres something in there). very refreshing even in the early spring. a lot smoother than i expected it to be too."
"Overall impression: Refreshing and enjoyable. Nothing to bring me back but a nice change from the ordinary. A nice witbier."
"Cheers"
"I find this beer a little lacking and one dimensional. Appearance is fine at a yellow gold with a large white head. The nose is lemony and herbal. Coriander and orange peals are quite present. Taste follows the aromas with the addition of a strong yeastiness and a bit of ginger and cloves. All the ingredients are there but this beer just doesnt scream, Im a fun and cheerful wit to me like I like my wit beers to. Its really almost hefe like and not very wintery to boot."
"Had on tap at the Fox and Hound in Beavercreek. Cloudy dense light chamomile in color. Aroma is wheaty, some spiceyness, perhaps coriander(?). Taste was good, mouthfeel was medium. I picked up more wheat notes (not typical bubblegum or other wheatbeer notes), but more of the grain and texture in the taste. Mentally I was comparing this one with Allagash white, and I think it can come pretty close, especially if fresh."
"Overall: Solid brew, but nothing above and beyond-no Wow factor. I'd definately have again, but wouldn't specifically search for it. Worth a try."
"Very hazy very pale yellow with a big-bubbled ugly head with little retention or lacing. Smell is pleasantly interesting, with light lemon-banana, white pepper, bitter orange peel, and rubber. Taste is surprisingly similar, though adds a significant honey component. Feel is medium body with carbonation that, although it is at low levels, feels big bubbled and sizzly. Finishes sweet and coating. Pleasant."
"A decent beer."
"Even though it isn't among my handful of favorite witbiers, this is still a fine effort from the master brewers in Kalamazoo. I continue to be impressed by the excellence displayed by Bell's across the entire spectrum of craft beer. Winter White Ale is merely the most recent example and is a beer that I recommend without reservation."
"Smell got better with a move to orange spice. Taste was definitely worth the wait, but not very over powering. But, I am wondering if the deep freeze chilled things down too much? A good Bell's version of a Wit beer, but definitely not of German comparison. I could definitely sit back and drink a couple more of these."
"Goes down easily, but has a few areas to improve."
"d - There are many better witbiers available don't waste your money. Generally I like witbiers this one just did not do it for me."
"A disappointment to me. True to the style but nothing special here."
"D: I can see having a few of these, but I really want a hefe flavor and the Christian Morelien Hefe fills the bill."
"Wasn't all that impressed with this seasonal offering from Bell's. Poured out to a hazy yellow color with a big white foam head. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas were of grains, yeast and some farm straw and hay. Taste was slightly odd... overly spicy with citrus tones and minimal malt. Mouthfeel was almost biting, with some acid like qualities battling with my tastebuds. Only fair drinkability. I'd go for something else from the Bell's line-up first."
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Winter Ale pours out a pale yellow color with a foamy, white head. The aroma is very spicy, with pepper and coriander with a wheat base. Clean malt flavor with wheat and spices. Some citrus flavors, mainly orange peel. Finishes with grassy hops. Crisp and moderately refreshing. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy. This is not what I expected for a Winter seasonal, but there's no reason to hold that against the beer. Tasty and easy to drink. Another quality Bell's beer."
"Pours the cloudiest, orange-juice gold with a finger of white head on top. Nose is peppery, with hints of clove and banana esters and musty wheat. Taste is extremely dry, pepper/clove spicy and heavy on the yeast. Mouthfeel is pretty thick due to all the suspended yeast, co2 is lively. Overall wasn't too impressed with this one. I looks pretty, but is so dry it lacks any real character."
"More or less Bell's winter version of Oberon, a beer that I'm not that fond of anyway. If you want a light, easy quaffer in December you could do worse though."
"Not really crazy about this one. As the scores reflect, it's average all around. Nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing interesting or redeeming. Golden color, too many bubbles, no real head. Smell and taste have a somewhat pleasing lemony character and some typical spicing, but nothing really catches my interest. It's got a light, pale malt backdrop and a very non-descript hop profile. Still, it isn't exactly bad, just not good. Thin mouthfeel, and like I said, a little too bubbly for the style. This beer would be drinkable but it's just not interesting enough for me to have more than one. Try Bell's other stuff, this is probably my least favorite of the mixed case I got."
"overall- this was pretty much what i expected out of this beer. it has a nice clean, smooth taste that is pretty enjoyable. only thing im not a fan of is the aftertaste which could become a little annoying."
"An interesting choice for a winter brew, but I can see the spice flavors working well with some Christmas treats."
"not a bad wit, just funny timing, but thats bell's"
"An unusual choice for a winter ale, but really pretty nice and easy to drink. ."
"Pours a beautiful, light golden color, no head. Cloudy, served chilly and let to warm. Smells of wheat, light fruits, perhaps banana, and apricot. Citris smells. Plenty of flavor, it reminds me of Hoegaarden, only I like it better. Wheaty and citris dominates, with clove and peppery hints. Really good balance. This is a very drinkable beer, despite my so so ratings. Was hoping for a little more, but another great offering from Bell's"
"This isn't a bad wheat beer, but wheats are bland to me. For a winter beer? Guess I just don't understand. If you see it, do give it a try, but don't expect much."
"Overall, this hardly seems like a traditional winter ale to me. Taste is relatively weak and somewhat lacking. Not terrible, but not terribly impressive either."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is white and fluffy like freshly fallen snow. The aroma is more like a hefe weizen than a witbier. Yeast, wheaty and tagny with only faint hints of coriander. The taste is rather light for a witbier. Tangy wheat makes up the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little too much carbonation. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but I would rather have Hoegaarden or Allagash White."
"An excellent seasonal offering from Bell's."
"I would say I that I'll be in the store at least one more time to grab this before they run out. Good seasonal beer, although I usually prefer the darker beers during winter."
"All in all, an OK wheat; however, there are better options out there. This is a moderately sessionable beer; if you like bubblegum, you'll probably like this beer."
"Not so many applications for this beer drinker...though I prefer this to Oberon. Seems more summer than winter to me. Not lush or enthralling but solid, refreshing, and accessible."
"I think Bell's should rename this beer ""Wheat Zero."""
"Once again a good offering from the folks at Kalamazoo Brewing. Keep up the great work."
"This is a bit cleaner beer then I had anticipated, but it would make a good session beer when in season. Oddly enough, though, with its clean nose and finish I think I would rather drink it on a hot day than a cold one."
"Beer is good. Happy peppery wit beering."
"An odd choice for a Winter Ale. Very wheat-ey. They upped the gravity to make a creamier and more flavorful Belgian Wit, but it still lacks the punch in malt complexity and alcohol for me to consider it for a winter beer. Having said that, it's a good beer. spicy, sweet, bananna-ey, citrucy, peppery, sweet, and subtle. Little dryness or lingering. Creamy and silky to the palate. I'd put another lable on it and drink it into the spring and summer."
"Fairly drinkable. Although still way too yeasty, much better than Oberon, which I'm not a fan of."
"Witbiers are not my first choice, but I'd gladly enjoy a few of these on a day like this...in the Winter, I'd rather reach for something that warms the belly and this is not that beer."
"D: Very drinkable, unfortunately part of a mix a six."
"Medium yellow in colour with a slight amount of haze. Very yeasty aromas along with notes of sweet orange and black pepper. The flavor is very much on the sweet/fruity end of the wit beer spectrum, with a clove and yeasty hefe undercurrent. The blending of the two styles doesnt quite work, as the similar phenolic aspects of the two styles become a bit overpowering on the finish. A nice try though, and still very drinkanble."
"Slàinte!"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy light orange color with one finger of head. There's a bit of lacing. The smell is very light. The only thing detectable is just a hint of citrusy aroma. The taste, however, has plenty of flavor. It's nice and malty, just ever so slightly sweet. Wheat and biscuit malts are present. There's a nice refreshing lemon flavor as well, and even a hint of spice. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is very nice. A decent witbier."
"Overall, very nice, definitely worth a try if you can get it. I could easily drink this one on cold winter nights or on hot summer days, very quenching and just overall, very good."
"Drinkability - a tasty wheat beer from Bell's, I could recommend it as above average."
"Package this baby for summer and slap a special ""Summer Sun Wheat"" label on it and people will eat it up. Much better than Oberon."
"Mouthfeel is good with just enough body to roll over the palate smoothly..good carbonation. Drinkability here is very nice...easily sessionable. I personally think this would be better as a summer seasonal. As a side note...the label picture is beautiful..kudos to Bell's on another tasty brew."
"Cloudy and hazy bright yellow-orange color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that lasts and leaves some lacing in my glass.. Fresh tart citrus and mild spice flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes a bit sour, a very refreshing and drinkable brew."
"Bell's other wheat beer. Cloudy yellow, decent head that vanishes quickly to a thin blanket. Slight spice and orange peel aroma. Smooth taste, kinda bland. A lil full on the mouthfeel, light carbonation. Not a great beer, but not a bad one. Not something I'd look hard for, but something worth drinking."
"This one's a real winner; and if you think about it, it's not such an odd choice for a winter beer from a brewery that makes more than a half a dozen stouts year-round."
"Throws a murky dark yellow; ¼ inch decent capped head. The nose mostly attracts wheat, Belgium spices and some citrus. First impression is nice, a very decent blending of pepper and citrus, yeast and some wheat crackers noted in the body. Very mellow and contained, but very well done. The palate is well rounded with wheat, which is the dominating feature of this offering; all in all, pretty solid and a nice change of pace winter selection!"
"Hazy, wheat beer like yellow gold with a nice head of white froth. Aromas of wheat, coriander, lemon, orange, and your typical wit-like aromas. Taste is simple, one-dimensional and totally wheaty wit. Orange peel, wheat, a nice yeastiness, and citrus fruits. Mouthfeel is creamy and nce and the drinkability is good as well. A 4 star wit from bell's brewing."
"This does not seem to be just a winter packaging for Oberon. I prefer the depth of malts in Oberon to this - this beer is more in line with the Belgian White style."
"Final Thought: This beer is everywhere, better in the middle of the beer than anywhere else, a solid brew from one of the best."
"Bright, lemon yellow body with adequate yeast haze visibility. Head is cloud white, and started big, but didn't last long. Husky, yeasty wheat malt aromas dashed with lemony orange, clove, and light coriander. Smells how a witbier should, even if it is a little mild. Milky wheat malt flavors start out, but are quickly joined/overpowered by yeasty citrus. Tart, acidic lemon and orange juice refreshingly take us into the mildly candy-sweet, spice-tinged, yeasty finish. Medium bodied, with a milky, smoothie feel up front, followed by a refreshing, acidic bout of carbonation, and then back to the smoothie. Another good beer from Bell's."
"Hazy, white gold in hue, the color and appearance of the liquid is typical for a Wit. The head developed poorly; at the apex the foam was only a half finger in height. It didnt last long, in a moment it faded to a fizzy cap before almost fading away. There was some subsequent lacing but it was spotty and it clung poorly. Ive seen better-looking Wits but this offering is still improved over normal. The nose says Wit and I cant ask for much more. Wheaty-malt backbone with a yeasty undercurrent that melts perfectly with spiced citrus zest. Coriander is clear and pronounced. Orange peel is equally easy to detect. Add in hints of clove and vanilla. Modestly sharp, the potency is moderate. Id like it louder but there isnt anything incorrect with the bouquet. I like it but what is special about it? Should there be anything special about it? Typical. Pleasant. Inviting. I really like the palate; it is very lively and assertive. When I first noticed Bells brewed a Wit as a winter seasonal I thought it must be some huge, Imperial Wit. It is not. However, a Wit as a winter seasonal does make sense. OSA is spiced. Most Winter Warmers as spiced. Whats the difference? Back to this beer, if youve had a great Wit then youve had this one. It is textbook from start to finish and since it is well-done, typical works. Heavy spiced bill up front, coriander, ginger, clove. In the middle is a wheaty-malt backbone, blasts of citrus, orange, and more spice (subtle this time). The finish is soft, yeasty, wheaty, with a lovely juiciness about it. Similar aftertaste. This is a great tasting Wit. Lovely. This would be a perfect beer for a chilly Sunday brunch. A tickle fuller than medium in body; subtle, natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is very pleasant. It is extremely easy to drink, in a good way. I could imbibe in a few of these beers in one setting. It also helps the abv is low, which is something I dont see much of in winter beers. I enjoyed this beer completely. Ill get some more next year, I hope. I purchased a six-pack in Kansas City. It is worth a try, IMO."
"A bit of a different winter time offering from Bell's. Nice looking in the glass with a hazy golden color and thin, white, bubbly head. Presents a pleasant floral aroma with hints of banana, oranges, and a bit of spice (coriander and maybe a bit of pepper?). A mild overall taste with a dry finish. The spiciness present in the aroma along with citrusy flavors linger and add some depth of flavor. A light bodied beer with a crisp dry feel in the mouth. Not a bad tasting beer, but not particularly exciting--I feel like I'm still waiting for something else to emerge flavorwise."
"Still one of my all time favorites."
"A great example of a witbier. Very spicy and citrusy, with hints of coriander. Color is a beautiful golden orange hazy color that is a treat to the eye. Good hop presence, perfect carbonation for a beer such as this. An unusual selection for a winter beer, but a good one anyways."
"Finishes very clean and refreshing. Didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind another."
"A curious choice of style for this season, especially from a brewery in frigid Michigan. The Winter Wile Ale poured with a delicately pale straw colored, cloudy, fizzy body. The head was thinner than a Barbie doll suffering from anorexia, and did not stick around too long. The aroma was nicely estery with the appropriately anticipated banana, lemon, and clove flavors. Taste was creamy, tangy, and spicy with a fuller mouthfeel than the looks suggest. Very easy to drink with a low ABV, this is a very nice Witbier on its own merit, and quite a departure from the other winter seasonals that are around."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4"" bright white head over the light straw brew. Head fades down to a thin layer of bubbles, not unexpected for the style, and lacing is minimal. Aroma is slightly earthy wheat combined with a citrus sour twang. Taste is a pleasingly sedate wheat character, sharing the stage with a slight sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is a bit better. Worth a try, but not one of their best offers, in my opinion."
"This one poured a hazy yellow with a slight orange cast. It had a large white head with poor retention, but a little stickage. It smelled of banana and citrus, with a bit of cloves thrown in. The flavour was a mix of raw wheat and mild citrus, fairly well balanced and with a dry finish. Moderately slick mouthfeel, light body and medium/high carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer, but not an exceptional white beer. I think I enjoyed it more than the scores would indicate."
"An OK wheat, rating lower than this brewery's standard. Sweet with cloves, ginger and orange from yeast. Combo winter warmer spices and wheat. Reminds me of herbal tea xmas stuff. Brought by contributing Yankee to Doug Shoemaker's All Star Beer Tasting."
"The bottled version was not what I expected, but still very nice. I had thisone ( I think ) on tap with a different appearance. Thisone however poured a hazy yellow with a nice, average, soft white head that left little lace in spots. The aroma was grass like with a hint of citric. The taste carried that citric zest of lemon while a good blending dose of carbonation cut through a thick wheat base. Leaving a crisp mouthfeel alittle tart. A nice beer that is refreshing and quenching. It would be nice to see thisone, say; Christmas in July. It would fit very well that time of year as well."
"Paid $8.99 for a six-pack. Light in the glass, yellow with a slight of orange. Frothy white head on top. Taste is wheaty, spicy, and caramalized orangey. I'm not sure how the hell they do that without any spices. Overall not THAT impressive on taste, but still an enjoyable brew for it's other characteristics."
"I expect to see this style as a warm-weather seasonal, so kudos to Bell's for changing things up a bit. It is, however, a pretty typical American stab at this style. Pours a hazed gold with a minimal thin lace. Aroma is fresh and grassy, full of yeast and citrus. Flavor shows some fresh floral notes as well as some solid citrus and earthy hops to balance the cloves 'n' bananas spice. Mouthfeel is crisp with a rush of carbonation, though not overdone. All in all not mindblowing, not one I would seek out, but a pretty standard interpretation, and a refreshing one at that."
"poured a very pale hazy yello-orange color with a froathy head that lasted for awhile then dissappeared. yesty corriander and orange aroma, fruity. good amount of carbonation that cuts through the thick wheat malt body leaving your mouth very refreshed. excellent wit."
"An interesting concept for a winter ale. Not quite sure why it qualifies as such (the very white head?, or just a contrast to the summer wheat?). Anyway, nice enough."
"Another very enjoyable drinkable beer from Bell's."
"I do not especially care for oberon, and thought this would be entirely too simliar for me to bother with. I gave it a go, it's nothing like oberon. at first i thought it was worse, but now i think it is a bit more flavourful, and I guess a good way to do a wit for the winter. an alright beer, worth trying if you haven't."
"On tap at Old Bag of Nails pub in Columbus. This beer is a very hazy dark yellow color with a compact white head and very little lacing. The aroma is spicy, with wheat and citrus. Light and crisp body with a flavor that stings the tongue a bit. It is a zesty brew and a little more flavorful than the bottled version I remember. Orange and other fruits, along with spice and a touch of malt on the back end. The finish is very dry and comes back to the citrus. A step up from the Blue Moons of the world but falls a little short of the world-class Wits out there."
"This is an interesting hybrid between a hefe-weizen and a wit. I think this brew is actually much better out of the bottle than it was the few times I've had it on tap. If I couldn't find Holy Moses or Celis White, this may be an acceptable alternative."
"Not at all expected given the name, but not a let-down. Who drinks wheat beers in the Winter? Apparently Bell's and they've converted me quite easily. A nice production, this is well suited for many pours in any season."
"And it is Orwellian insanity to market this as a winter seasonal."
"from the bottle. poured a hazy straw with a white head that didnt last long. aroma bread yeast, citrus, sour orange, wheat, and straw. flavor hops, straw, wheat, lemon, bitter. this should not be a winter beer. I think it would be better suited for the summer standing at the bbq griling some steak."
"Seems to be a hybrid of some sort...very enjoyable though..not a BIG winter brew but worth a six-pack of enjoyment....no off flavors..."
"Pours a hazy yellow with some golden orange highlights and a thin white head. Some typical witbier aromas like coriander, orange zest, wheat malt and a fair amount of yeastiness in the nose. Initially starts off malt sweet and then traditional spicings kick in and a bit of citrusy zing near the finish. Not a bad witbier at all, I'm just unsure what makes it a Winter White. Pretty well carbonated. Drinkable year-round."
"It pours a cloudy pale lemony yellow with virtually no head. Aroma consists of corriander, banana and a little bit of vanilla. Medium-to-full-bodied mouthfeel with a crisp carbonation. The initial taste consist of wheat malt, corriander and some vanilla sweetness. Some lemony bitterness towards the back finishes things off."
"Bells WWA was a welcome change from the dark heavy winter beers that dominate this part of the year (winter). Beer poured a hazy yllow that left a creamy, foamy head. I can smell hints of orange and corriander. Taste is relatively straight forward, a strong wheat taste that leads to a spicy, hefe-weiss, like finsh on the palate. The drinkability of this beer is great, a perfect counterpart to the traditional winter brews."
"This beer pours a pale pale golden color. There is a finger of head taht falls to ring the beer. The nose is all about he wit. There is a lot of orange and spice from the malt and the yeast. Smells like a nice beer to me. Not my favorite style, but I do like it. The flavor is dominated with the spices initially, but hte sweet orange character comes through secondarily, with a grand finish of spice. This is a really nice wit beer. The feel is thick. More thick than others I have had in while. A really nice wit. the finish is a bit creamy and easy drinking. I am glad I have another of these beers waiting for me in the cellar. Try it if you can. Interesting take on a winter brew, but welcomed relief from the big hops and big malts."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin head. Smells of orange, with some cloves and spice. Tastes just about the same. Well ballanced beer that finished a little dry. Would rank higher if the beer wasn't as dry at the end. This has been one of the better beers I have tried in a long time. The way Blue Moon should taste. All around great beer. I just wish it wasn't seasonal. One of Bell's best."
"Hazy pineapple yellow color, slightly greenish flat head of 1/4 of an inch. Wide and thin laces, lots of small dots as well. Yeasty aroma, straw, bird's nest soup, some anise. Prickly carbonation picks up the mouthfeel. Slightly spicy, gingery and orange with a vermouth feel edging in. Sweetest mid mouth, clovey esters, and then funels to a more lemony bitterness at the close. Medium dry aftertaste, thinnish and slightly metallic in feel, usually the way the style hits me. Pretty good beer, a bit too fluffy and licorice-tinged in the finish as Wits tend to get. Actually softer and sweeter right out of the bottle."
"Super drinkable; quite smooth, and quite lovely in that respect too; one thing I've always found hard to like about Wit's is the drinkability. This is opposite of that impression, as this is quenchable for sure. A bit odd that it's a Winter seasonal cuz this would make for a great summer brew; and that's no foolin'. For me; a hard review to put numbers to. It seemingly could be better, but I like it alot, which I think the numbers might not show."
"Cloudy golden liquid with a thin white head. The head evolved into a thin white wispy ring, leaving no lace on the glass at all. Smells of citrus and spice, like corriendar. Tastes of lemon zest, with some spices, quite a bit I thought. Lots of carbonation. Light bodied. Very sparkly. Very easy to drink, and refreshing. Although a witbier is not what I think of at winter time, this was pretty good."
"Hazy orangish-yellow color with a white head that dissipates to a ring. The aroma is yeasty, and has bananas and cloves, it has a bit of black pepper to it as well. The flavor is yeasty, and again it has a peppery clove and banana taste. It is somewhat like their Oberon, but a bit more fuller and maltier. It is medium in body and smooth drinking, with a drying finish. Not bad at all."
"Pours a light yellow color and is very cloudy. Tall white head that stays around for a while and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma was very citrusy, with hints of yeast spiciness and clove. The yeast and wheat play a very large part in the flavor - gives it a thick and spicy feel. Lots of orange and lemon flavors. Very nice body. This is a little strange for a wit, but I really enjoyed it."
"Very hazy, with an unusual appearance, a cross between orange and grapefruit juice. Something funky in the aroma that was a touch off-putting at first. Very much the classic spiced Belgian witbier, substantial yeast and spice flavors. According to the bottle, this is a wheat with seasonal spices - quite frankly I was a bit let down - not that there is anything wrong with the beer, just that I don't detect anything that particularly distinguishes this beer from the rest of the spiced wit pack. A nice-enough beer, but it seems a poor choice to tout as a winter seasonal."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a tiny bone white head. Lots of wheat and bananas all over the nose. Slightly sweet palate with spice, wheat and tropical tones on the palate. Light, but flavorful mouthfeel. Long, lingering finish. A pleasant beer. Bell always does a great job. Good to see this one bottled, finally. Try this one."
"Not sure how to categorize this beer. Murky yellow orange with very little head. Aroma is slightly fruity with a touch of spiciness sneaking past the heavy, earthy yeastiness. Sweet, peppery flavor with a lot of yeast evident. I see more of the yeast in this beer than the results of the yeast."
"This beer poured a very cloudy yellow color and formed a small foamy snow white head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small but busy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, clove and yeast. A flavor of hops, clove with a slightly doughy aspect. The finish is sprite but a touch astrigent."
"Drinkability: I asked just to make sure I didn't get the bottom of a keg. Nope, was the reply. No, in fact we tapped this yesterday. You might be the 2nd person to have tried it. I think they missed their season, and I really wasn't impressed with this. Maybe try a double white instead of this murky mess. My first lackluster Bell's."
"Nice smooth and creamy feel with easy carbonation and an even nicer body. Keeps it real and makes me want to let it massage my mouth all night. Tasty brew all the way."
"A little darker, spicier, hopier, and bubblier than most Wits."
"A very hazy beer with a thin white head when served from the tap. The aromas are of banana (dominant), and a dusty spiciness. Very banana tasting in the flavor as well, it dominates the flavor. Nice wheaty-grain character in the finish. This is certainly mislabeled as this beer is quite German in character and usually a white refers to a Belgian style of beer. Light tasting and refreshing, where I was expecting a ""double"" Wit style of beer brewed at winter warmer strengths. A good beer but a bit of a let down. I did not notice any of the sour character others seemed to have notice, perhaps their samples were infected."
"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a moderate white head. The smell was very lemony and slightly spicy. The taste reminded me distinctly of an overspiced Oberon. Citric flavors are dominant and a tarty finish is there. Lots, almost too much, coriander in the body. Light in body and mouthfeel this beer is simply decent and not one of Bell's best offerings. I think this was a bad batch of Oberon with a different name!"
"Drinkability is hampered by the sheer sweetness of the is brew. In fact my buddy said it tasted like a ""Blue Moon on a night on the town, ready to put out."" I'm not quite sure what that means exactly but I think I agree."
"I had this at the sports bar in Marshall Field's in downtown Chicago, ""InField's," and found it a pleasant surprise. Prices are interesting: $3.50 for 24 oz Gooses, $4.50 for micros on tap (Summit, Bell's, Sierra Nevada), and $5.50 for imports (just Guinness and Heineken). The macro-swill is only in bottles. Not a bad deal."
"Flavor comes through with a nice yeasty character, and also coriander strength. This brew is very easy to drink and has a fairly thin body. I am not sure why it is called a winter white as it seems like a typical wit beer to me. Nice brew that I would enjoy just as much on a hot summer day as in the winter."
"This is affectionately known as ""Snow-beron", a takeoff on the summer beer, ""Oberon"". Is it better than Oberon? No, just different. Where Oberon has a fruitiness to it, this has the traditional wheat beer spice. Both are excellent. This needs to be bottled or else I am going to be spending too much time at the local Pub..."
"My first wi-fi review....quite nice to sit the laptop at the bar and write the review as I go. A nice wit, and definitely a treat to see the style in the midst of winter, even if it's not a warmer. Definitely one I'd have again."
"Strange style for a winter seasonal."
"Whatever Vecenie's did for the Pittsburgh area it's amazing setting up the deal with Bell's to bring in their products was a huge step but now we're getting a taste of their winter white ale, wow thank you? Appearance: Cloudy peach golden with a nice chunky whtie head nice full sporadic layer of patched lacing. Aroma: Spiced up, banana an excellent Bell's wit. Taste: Slightly creamy sharp sweetness of malted wheat, creamy at first but then the coriander and zest of the peppery hops takes a nice turn toward oh yeah. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body kinda beefed up Oberon ala winter white, pretty damn good I'm a fan. Drinkability: Awesome session all the way solid all around one of my favorite wits so far."
"Hazy golden orange appearance. Actually, quite murky looking. A fair sized off white head sits on top and leaves sparse lace down the sides of the glass as I drink. Aromas of clove and banana, yeast and pepper hit my nostrils. The taste is quite nice. Very nice bavarian weizen profile. Some great banana and vanilla things happening. And more subtle tones of pepper and clove. Yeasty tones are quite nice and a little bready. When I tasted this tonight, I was hoping for a big ol weizenbock or something. I didn't know what style it was, but after tasting it, I was guessing German style Hefe. It has a great full body and a luscious mouthfeel. Very easy drinking and quite tasty. After one try, I'd have to say I prefer this to their Oberon ""American Wheat"" beer. I just think it has more character and depth. I'd like to see this one in bottles over the summer."
"Drinkability is quite good, but in the final summation, this Bell's fan would sooner reach for a TwoHearted or one of their spectacular stouts. I hope it appeals to others, as it's not a bad beer in the least. Just not great."
"Pours a hazy, creamy yellow color with a light tinge of apricot orange. Topped off with a bit of fine and fleeting head. This was served way too cold, so I had to wait a bit for the nose to develop. The smell that emerged was pleasant but unremarkable--not inappropriate for this style. Clean grains and light floral scents. Taste was crisp with hints of banana and clove complementing the foundational grains. The mouthfeel was the most disappointing feature of this beer--unduly creamy and even milky. Still, this is a nicely drinkable beer but with the toned-down character that makes wits pleasant but uninteresting."
"I was eagerly anticipating this beer and it looked great as it poured a nice golden yellow with crisp white head. Aroma was very pleasant had a slight malt profle but dominated by citrus and clove notes. Little banana, little orange maybe something else that I can't quite finger. Taste was not as strong or malty as I was anticipating and left a litte sour on the palate. To me they might have been better going all out and making a strong Hefe, as someone below suggested. I was a little confused by this one and not really sure what to think. Felt good in the mouth but not as ""lively"" as I would expect. My experience with Bell's suggests they will refine this over time but not the best from this great brewery."
"Drinkability: A hefe/wit hybrid. Smells like a hefe, tastes more like a wit. Uses both Belgian Trappist and hefe yeast strains in the fermenation (according to powerpoint slide from the head brewer). Quite drinkable, but I liked Oberon better. Still, an interesting idea for a winter beer."
"ng"
"This beer is probably misnamed. I found it to be a direct competitor with the finest German wheat beers such as Paulaner and Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbiers. I was told the same thing as another reviewer about the Bell's folks being concerned it would compete to closely with Oberon. Oberon is a starter kit for people about a year away from sampling German-style wheat beers. This beer has the wonderful banana and yeast flavor of the best German Weissbiers and is the best American Microbrew version of this style I have sampled. I wish this was readily available in bottles!"
"Sampled from a limited bottle run. This beer will be available on draft only this coming fall and winter. Hazy straw color with a fizzy white head. Some sediment is present in the pour. Looks more like a hefeweizen than a wit. Nose is doughy with notes of clove, curacao, banana and a less-than-desirable egg aroma which could be attributed to the yeast. Banana, orange rind, a faint hint of coriander, graininess and an earthy hop finish characterize the flavor of this ale. I don't know if it's the yeast strain or what, but this is still quite reminiscent of Oberon. Drinks quite well overall, this will be nice to drink on draught... but I'd prefer it in the summertime."
"A highly quaffable ale from Bell's sampled yesterday at the Mich Beer Fest. It's only real ""drawback"" is that it's orange-ish, golden color is far too yellow for a witbier. Dull orange and banana aromas are potent and enjoyable but, again, it strikes me as more of a hefe than a wit. Similarly, big orange-banana smoothie flavors dull any intended coriander or other spices. It's a very tasty beer, but it's not within the style. Frankly, I'd be overjoyed if they replaced Oberon with this and stopped calling it a witbier."
"The nose of this particular beer is banana. The body is cloudy and the hue is pale yellow. I observed some yeast with this beer. I definitely was not impressed by the taste of this beer. After about half-way through I had had enough and tried another of their beers. This definitely is not one of my favorite beers from this brewer."
"This brew has a very fruity banana aroma. Its body is a weak yellow orange color that is very cloudy with yeast evident. It tastes as fruity as it smells and went down very easy, but later drinks caused my stomach to do flip flops. I didn't like it and eventually wound up getting another Porter and having them pour the rest of this beer down the drain."
