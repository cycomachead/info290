"Final Thoughts: Another good beer from Great Divide, and a style I don't typically enjoy no less. Highly recommended for anyone new to Belgians or looking for a lighter option within the genre. Would I drink it again? Sure."
"Easy to drink yet not a lot of flavor"

"Overall pretty bad, just cause you overload a beer with so much spices that you can't taste the beer itself, doesn't make it a witbier, and def doesn't make it good. This is again that ""American"" idea of candying up and spicing up a European style of beer so it fits the typical American palate, but ends up destroying the beer. Where is the wheat too? So little actual wheat, thin too."

"Mouthfeel is light and smooth, with a watery feel, a light body and a grainy aftertaste that just kind of hands around like eating a piece of dry toast with margarine. Average is the best way to describe this brew, nothing jumped out at me as noteworthy and it was just alright overall."

"O: a decent Belgian style witbier."
"Light, spritzy, and crisp. Pleasant wheaty taste with just enough spice. Modestly flavored and richly carbonated.  A great summer brew. I don't see anything wrong with this. It's a clean and sharpish Witbier. Golden color with a white cap in the Ommegang chalice. From the 12 oz bottle in the six-pack purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach."

"Beer #3 on this great divide sample night. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a whiteish/yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, light spice and wheat. Taste is also mild, some spices, a very light wheat, refreshing, but on the bland side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is nothing offensive, but a mediocre beer."
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow color with a white, creamy like head that doesn't last long and leaves barely a lace of foam on top. It has a a weak nose, barely hints  of spices and yeast. The taste is balanced, with spices and yeast, with some bright fruit. It is full-bodied and very balanced in the palate. Overall it is a nice summer, fall beer. Very bright and easy to drink."

"Pours a slightly hazed very pale yellow. There is a short-lasting creamy-ish white head that leaves just a hint of lacing. The aroma is faint, with just hints of fruity esters, spices, and yeast. The taste is equally anemic. The body is much fuller than expected given it's aroma and flavor, with a nice fullness to it and just a hint of carbonation on the finish. Not terrible, but certainly lacking. A rare miss from Great Divide."

"O-This beer is refreshing enough, but I think it tries to do too much. The mixture of hoppy, almost-IPA flavors doesn't jive well with the witbier flavors. That being said, this beer is far from a drain pour and drinks well enough on a hot summer day. I could see this pairing well with Thai food."

"Having this in a nonic pint. Pours a pearly yellow (wife said it's almost green), with no major head, light visible suspension, and kindof an oily look to the surface. Not too much to be said for the appearance, though I do give it points for some haze. Smells yeasty and funky, maybe some light lemon zest, not getting a lot off the nose, I must say. Watery, saggy mouthfeel, not much flavor, almost seems a little flat. Has a little zest to it and a medium to light sweetness, but just tastes like a watered down beer or maybe even lemonade to me. Was expecting something like a Hoegaarden but this beer does not come close. I think this is the second season they've done it and I hope it's the last. GD: give this one the boot and make a real wheat. Waste of a seasonal spot."

"Over not too bad, easy drinking, just a bit too carbonated and the finish is a bit watery."

"Overall: A nice summer wheat ale. Good citrus and spice notes."
""
""
""
""
"The body was very nice, smooth, even, crisp, and with decent carbonation. Drinkability was good, my pint was gone quickly enough. Overall, an example of the style that's missing a bit. A pleasant enough quaff, but not a particularly notable one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Other reviewers suggested different yeasting approach since yeast is so significant to this style."
"Overall- Not one of the better witbiers that I have tried. Not a bad beer but it is forgettable."
""
""
"Poured into a large tulip, Heyday sports a little bit of fine creamy head, and appears a hazy yellow/gold. Aroma is mostly of earthy orange peel/coriander and slightly milky. A few sips reveal a pleasant sweetness and yeast complexity, mingling with a nice bit of carbonation to cut thru and finish cleanly. Medium bodied, but finishes pretty clean. Not a very exciting Wit, but it's well made and I don't notice any big flaws in it. If witbier is your thing then it's worth a try."
""
""
""
"O: Although this beer definitely looks like a witbier, it lacks the refreshing and thirst-quenching properties exhibited by many of the beers in this style."
""
"O- would drink again, but not in love with this one in the Witbier style"
""
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable beer. Crisp, refreshing, citrusy, tangy."

"This is a good summer option, much like Victory Summerlove. The bittering on the end is very refreshing for this summer beer. It’s very drinkable and has a reasonable amount of flavor. I really do enjoy this beer on a hot hot day."

"I decided to try this one, even been thrown off by the low score. What a great surprise. This is a solid wit, it is definitely on my top 5. The taste is very balanced with not too overpowering combination of orange and coriander, goes smooth and smells great. Very easy drinking. I will be looking for more. Definitely a hidden gem in this style."
""
""
""
""
"Of the style"
""
""
"Overall, this is an outstanding effort from Great Divide and one worth getting over and over."
""
"The mouthfeel is probably the best part of this beer. Nothing offensive or incredibly bad here but for a Witbier it just doesn't deliver the depth and strength of flavor/aroma needed. Somewhat disappointed for the first time by GD, bring back St. Brigids. Feels watered down."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid wit, very drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
"I'll give them the effort but that recipe needs to be tweaked big time."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An unoffensive, well-executed summer wheat beer. Very easy drinking - great for a hot day. I don't think this beer is winning any awards - but it's not trying to either. It's a beer that's hard not to like, but hard to rave about."
""

"Overall I paid 3 bucks for this since I like to try whatever Great Divide puts out and I was disappointed with this one. Needs to be discontinued or even better have a recipe change."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty disappointing beer. In the grand scheme of things it wasn't bad, but there are so many witbiers that I would select before this one. Too bad, because Great Divide has an otherwise stellar portfolio."
""
""
"Notes: It's drinkable and a decent Witbier not too bad for a warm day. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"O: maybe I don't get the style, so I went with fairly mediocre ratings across the boards. If you are more familiar (than I am) with the witbier style, this may be a better beer than I'm indicating. Probably good for drinking out in the sun all day or for warm, summer afternoon sessions, but it is not representative of what I typically want in a beer. That said, came back to the beer a few days later and it vibed a little better with me."
""
"O- A full-flavored sessionable wheat beer from none other than the good people at Great Divide. Keep the good suds comin guys."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The flavor was a bit of a let down. Very mild - not much there."
""
"OVERALL: Not a bad Belgian wit from Great Divide. Makes for a good summer option, and has some good characteristics. I would drink this again with no qualms."
""
"This is a rather nice, light beer with a solid flavor profile. This is a beer brewed to style that could satisfy those just looking for a Witbier or those who are looking for something refreshing to knock back on a hot day. I enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"Had this poured into a pilsner glass. Pretty nice witbier, possibly a touch underrated. The look is a very light haze, it almost looked clear at the thinner part of the bottom of the glass. Not much of a head here either. The aroma and taste matched very well, very light cloves and soft citrus. Solid."
"Taste-Coriander note, some spicy yeast. Light and refreshing enough, but flavors are a bit muddled. A middle-of-the-road witbier in a style with a lot of excellent examples."
"Overall, it's a good witbier. It just doesn't stand out in the crowd. On a hot day this one will drink perfectly. Otherwise, you may find it lacking some character."
""
"Overall, less than average…I actually sent it back as I thought that there was something wrong with it. I hope that I was wrong. I will give it another shot just to verify."
""
""
""
"A little T.E. Lawrence action on the label? Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy brass-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, dry corn, light egg, and light puffed rice. The taste holds notes of wheat, light coriander, light corn, and very light egg. Those last couple bits really hold this stuff back. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a sad, limp little wit, possibly the biggest downer I've yet had from Great Divide."
"Over all I love the pairings listed on the bottle I do happen to agree with them gouda cheese, belgian waffles , kung pao chicken ! This is a good beer, dont let my review fool you, I would order another. I think this beer would compliment those pairing rather than stand on its own."
"O: Good at times, but never really comes together. The hops notes don't work here, there are so much better wits in the world."
"O: Heyday is not one of GD's better brews. I can't think of a time I would select this one over Hoegaarden or Allagash White or Celis White. The clove is too strong and ruins an otherwise promising malty beer. A different fermentation temp or profile would be my first try -- an alternate yeast would be my next move."
"O-Not sure what they replaced to release this beer, but they should have kept their old offering."
""
""
"O: While this isn't the worst example of Wit I've ever had, it certainly wasn't the best. Not undrinkable, but there are better examples of the style out there."
""
"The flavor is spot on white ale, and very good. A bit heavy in the malt, a little more crispness and this beer would be best in class. A very good offering from Great Divide, and may become my go to Belgian White as it is a local brew. But the Avery White Rascal is good as well. Though problem to have! Too many great versions of a hard to find style that I really like!"

"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, oats, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and spice flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but very grain forward in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a huge fan of this wit. A bit sweet and overly spiced with some flavors that didn't go well for me."
"This one was a bit hit and miss for me. I could see drinking a few of these on a warm summer day, but certainly not a beer I'd order in the cool comfort of a bar."
"An enjoyable, well done wit. It is fairly average overall, with no one aspect being particularly memorable."
""
""
""
""
"A good beer all around, nearly in the middle of the pack for the style though. Its a tough style to crack let alone perfect, great go at it though."
"Overall a solid witbier that has some nice complexity. Real easy to sip on and would be great for a hot day."
"Overall - A nice hoppy and full flavored wit perfect for the summer. The extra hop kick gives it points for being different then the norm. Easy to drink with good balance, decent price, its a winner."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Excellent retention. and laceing. Aroma is of lemon, and candy. Body is creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is of lemon,bubble gum,and spice. A bit of a tart finish. Not the best verison of this style, but worthy of a try."
""
""
"Loving the white ale trend everybody has to make a witbier these days, this one looks good in the classical since hazed lemonade body with a bright white cloud texture head. Aroma has soft coriander and orange peel zinging through with a finishing lemon notes I love it. Flavor is creamy with the wheat notes and coriander bitterness, citrus peel finish has me wanting more of this stuff. That's about it here folks, body is medium to lighter end of the spectrum with ample flowing carbonation finishes with a spicy boutique of spice and citrus peel colliding. Overall one of the beers I won't look back at next time I come across a new white ale."
""
"Overall, this is pretty good and worth checking out."
""
""
""
"one of the best wits i've ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Refreshing and flavorful witbier with nice fruity and spicy notes."
""
""
""
"Great Divide has crafted an imminently drinkable summer seasonal with Heyday. It doesn’t stray from style, so it might not be quite as impressive or memorable as some of their other beer, but it still deserves praise for being so good and easy to drink. I just wish it wasn’t $9.99/six-pack…"
""

"Pours a hazy sandy yellow with a foamy white head and nice lacing. Aroma offers a present but smooth and subtle belgian with some banana, a little hay, hints of orange, spices (clove I think), sugars from the oats alongside the wheat malt. A creamy, velvety, active mouthfeel. Overall, like the addition of the oats in this one a lot, but not a wit fan and this one wasn't able to convert me."
""
"wow 5th review, this must have just emerged. the pour is cloudy and bright, but super pale and lighter, the head is fair, white and airy, but fading all the way. the nose is mild coriander, Belgian yeast, and a curious malt bill supplemented by oatmeal, which gives some interesting weight and sugars. I taste some citrus, orange peel or pith maybe, its pretty bitter but not from hops. more than any defining flavor this beer has a defining mouthfeel. its effervescently carbonated, like seltzer water only smaller and more alive bubbles, its super happening in the mouth which is right on for the first spring feeling day weve had here. this beer couldn't have come out at a better time, and it kicks the crap out of orabelle and Colette, their last couple of weird seasonal offerings that need never come back. this is first great divide beer to impress me in some time, you know I cant splurge for the barrel aged stuff, im a student still... overall this is a beer I will happily be drinking all summer as long as it remains on the shelves. impeccably well done, thanks for this. finally, something interesting and not watery for warm weather consumption! hard to keep a 6er around long..."

"O- This is a good beer for both people who like Wits as well as someone who isn't opposed to wheat and wants a light craft offering. I 'm more the latter, so i just thought it was good. This replaces Samurai and is a better ""light"" craft beer. I didn't care for Samurai. Nonetheless, its enjoyable. Nomad, Colette, and Orabelle are better light-bodied offerings from GD, though."
"Of course, I had to taste it. Thankfully, the aroma isn't in the flavor. Maybe slightly, but the orange and zestiness come to the rescue. A bit lemony. Sweet biscuit underneath. Finishes slightly dry and bubbly. I'd have to try this side by side with Colette to get a contrast. When I first tried Colette when it was released, the cream corn aroma is strong, too. Hopefully this one will be rid of it soon."
