3.5,7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a light golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of coriander and sage is quite dominant with light sweet wheat malt notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by sage with quite a bit of coriander, light orange peel and light wheat malt with some light residual sugar notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Quite enjoyed the spice mix but a fuller malt profile would have also been beneficial.","Phyl21ca","Aug 24, 2013"

3.28,0.9,3,3.75,3,3.5,3.25,"For the style, i do not think this beer delivers anything spectacular. pours a pale golden color with a thin, white head that disappears quickly. initial pour provided an intriguing blast of sage, with citrus notes and some grain mixed in as well. across the palate i get less of the rounded wheat characteristics from other examples of this style, but it isn't substantially off. corriander spice and citurs are the primary flavors wafting across the palate as the beer goes down; would not have guessed there is rye in the mash. easy drinking and inoffensive, this beer would refresh on a summer afternoon, but won't cause revelation.","dannydetox","Aug 20, 2013"

2.66,-18.2,3.25,3.5,2.25,2.25,2.5,"12oz bottle best before December. Served in imperial pint glass. Beer is pale yellow and just slightly cloudy, with a very thin white head. Aroma is of lemon and orange peel, with a hint of coriander in the back, but nothing to blow away your senses. Ooh, very fizzy. And once I get through the intense carbonation the coriander flavor is really dominant. And past that the beer is way sweet. I find the herbaceousness is the harshest part of this beer, and along with the intense carbonation it makes for an outright unpleasant drink. I find myself wanting either higher more hops to up the raw IBUs of this beer, or simply higher attenuation to dry it out. Oh, and the label promised a rye beer, but there's only the most subtle rye flavor hiding behind all this sweetness and flavoring nonsense. I guess the idea of a rye wit was novel but I'll pass next time.","hreb","Jul 06, 2013"

Medium bodied, there is a base of spicy rye, sage, and white pepper. Crisp, easy to drink- the use of sage and rye gives a spicy twist to a classic beer style.","GossageBrewery","Jun 20, 2013"

3.14,-3.4,3.5,3.25,3,3.5,3,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, the sage seemed interesting when I read about it on the label, but when I got to the taste and aroma of this beer the sage seemed to be too overpowering which didn't give this beer the best balance. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was a little tough to finish the bottle, it was a little smooth, but the overpowering sage did not hold my attention and one would be enough for me, no way would I want to session this beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both nice and turned out to be the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how overpowering the sage was, It would have been a lot nicer if the sage was toned down and the rye shined through a little more. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not what I look for in the style, and I wouldn't recommend this beer unless you really like sage. All in all I wasn't a fan of this one, Samuel Adams generally knows what their doing, but they got a little out of hand with the sage this time and the beer suffered because of it, better luck next time guys. Blueberry Hill Lager was my favorite of this years summer pack, the rest of the beers were average at best, I think last years summer pack was much better, I don't think I will get another one this season.","StoutHunter","Jun 01, 2013"

This guy...was pretty disappointing. This is the third different wheat rye beer I've tried, and I haven't really liked any of them, so it's possible that I just don't like the genre. The citrus and lighter flavors of the wheat just make for a weird mix with the earthy, spicy flavors of the sage and rye. The smell mirrors the flavor is golden with just a bit of haziness to it, which to me shows that this beer is really just a mix of two styles trying to be something different.

There's that spiciness and earthy quality that balances out the citrus pretty well. There's also a bit of tartness in the flavor. The body is light with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.

3.5,7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma of noble hops it seemed initially though an artificial lemon/flowery nature becomes more prominent as the cap settles. Sage comes across more as rosemary on the nose while the coriander and rye escape me when cold especially. Hop aroma adds a pine character with exposure. Rye texture is quite prominent in the taste while the lemon notes return on the finish. Rye gives the feel a fullish body while the citrus keeps it in check, though it does get a bit harsh for the style with warming. Overall pretty decent brew and a bit of a different tack.","HalfFull","May 07, 2013"

A much more prominent grainy wheat element shows up mid-sip and less sage all around. Orange peel and coriander sweetness transition to a lavender-like floral note and faint ginger. An interesting take on the style for sure. I really like the fresh grain in the finish.

The taste is similar...the spice and pepper kick in quickly...not much malt...drier than I expected. I don't get rye, but there is a notable grain streak running through the beer.

Harsh spicy flavor full of a wave of coriander and sage with mixed vegetable green notes. Full bodied slick mouthfeel can't wish or wait for much more.

This stuff pours a mostly clear light brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, spicy greenery (which I assume is the sage peeking through), black pepper, light coriander, and a pinch of what seems like banana peel. The taste throws some sweetness on the orange and ratchets that citrus a couple notches, but, don't you fret none, darlin', the spices, particularly that damn sage, shine through in the finish, lingering their momentarily, making sure my tastebuds fucking SAVOR their very existence. It's not a pleasurable encounter, sadly... The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, what may or may not have been a decent wit is torpedoed by the addition of the sage. I kinda wanna know reasoning what led to that particular conclusion, 'cause it musta been in a fairly purple haze...","TMoney2591","Apr 19, 2013"
