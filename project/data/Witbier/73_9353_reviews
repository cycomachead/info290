"1st time trying from the variety pack.  Did not catch the citrus taste as much as the coriander and chamomile but overall this is a very good beer.  The label says best served at 48 degrees.  I poured this at 52 degrees and this difference was of no significance to me."
"Chuck an orange slice in and you'll be fine."
"Great Lakes Holy Moses brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co., with an ABV of 5.4%  This brew pours out a cloudy amber color, with a nice white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it. Holy Moses has the look of most Witbier brews on the market.  The smell is sweet with citrus ,some grains, and malts. Now for the taste, it is sweet with some spices and malts. There is also a nice citrus flavor in the taste. Holy Moses has a lot going on in it. The mouthfeel of Holy Moses is rich smooth and clean.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving Great Lakes Holy Moses a 4.5 out of 5. I would buy this brew again.  Thank You Great Lakes Brewing Co."
"      Overall, I'll give Great Lakes Holy Moses - Great Lakes Brewing Co. a  4.25. This came as part of the spring variety packs, and as far as I'm aware as of this review, this is the only way to acquire this choice brew besides going to the brewery itself. Pick this up in the sampler& part the waves of bland witbiers."

"Sweet and malty, wheat and honey. Reminds me IG a Belgian with more of a mouth feel. Good head and hazy, lacking in scent and overall burst of flavor."
""
""
"Overall: through and through a really solid beer. When spices are well done in a beer they add so much to the complexity and texture. This beer is a prime example. Great Lakes continues to deliver great beer."

"This beer was a nice surprise. Poured nice and clear, big foamy head that didn't last. Citrus rushed my nose and the cold crisp smooth taste filled my mouth. sweet, not too bitter with a nice dry, crisp fresh ending. This may be a mainstay at the BrewPub!"

"This beer is a bit better on tap. More body than the bottled version and the coriander and cardamom was more pronounced. One of the better witbiers out there. Good in the bottle; great on tap."

"O- I enjoyed the wit, nice and clean. I really enjoyed that there was no spent yeast in this beer. Had a hard time finding the chamomile in the beer, though I'm not familiar with chamomile."

"O: great beer, picked a case up on clearance for $20, even better deal"
""
""

"Overall: A very good wit that quickly became my go to beer after hikes in a recent western trip. The creaminess does distinguish this one from others in the style. Very refreshing, I would certainly get this again."
""
""
""
"Excited to try a different version of this style This brew looks and smells like a typical wit. Compared to some of my preferred versions of this style this one is a little too tart and heavy on the lemon and the finish is on the long side. A solid beer but not outstanding for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another really nice hot weather beer pick up the six if you see it. This beer is better and a light lager on any hot day when you just want a cold refreshing beer. Solid witbeer made by great lakes!"
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a good summer seasonal choice. Refreshing and easy to drink, classic witbier with a malty backbone."

"Light golden pour, cloudy, light very fine lacing. paper thin head. Fragrant smells of chamomile, peach, pine, and a hint of something spicy, perhaps cardammon. Taste is light, fruity, and sweet. Not quite sure if this is really my thing, its very different from what I usually drink. It reminds me an awful lot of Trois Pistoles, and at such a lower price, might be called it's cheaper relative. Doesn't quite have the same depth, and is more lightly carbonated. Very drinkable, its well balanced, but in closing, not quite my thing."
""
""
""
"Overall – A good easy drinking brew and one to go for if you have the chance."
"Overall: a very refreshing and drinkable witbier. I will definitely have this again when I can get a hold of it."

"Price point - $1.75/single 12oz"

"O - Full bodied for a wit. Nice flavor profile. An off-note floated in and out of the profile, but it wasn't terribly distracting."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by 9/2/12. Pours a cloudy dark gold/yellow. Inch-thick white head on top. Lace left behind. Nose if a bounty of yeast, coriander, lemon, citrus. Great mouthfeel - good carbonation, smooth finish. Nice tart yeasty quality starts this one off, clean refreshing citrus - orange, lemon - and a mild earthy finish from the spices. This is a refreshing Wit that I would like to revisit again and again."
"The chamomile is subtle but adds interest to what is already a very good witbier. The yeast is not quite as strong as some Belgian examples, but I'm quite impressed and refreshed by this ale."

"Overall, I bought a case for vacation to be beach after having this a few times because I loved how easy drinking and tasty this offering is. Great Lakes never lets me down. This one is great for a beer snob like me who is your typical hophead, but also great for your Hefe and witbier fanatic. I love hoppy IPA's and this beer is far from that but it has plenty of other characteristics that please the palate and it's a great summer beer. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
"O - Good taste, easy drinking, but I feel it lacks a bit of a punch when compared to some others in the style."
""
""
""
"O-Very pleasant beer. Has great flavor and very drinkable. Highly recommend"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - the mouthfeel is probably the most notable thing about it, although in general it is very pleasant and drinkable. A nice witbier!"
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a straw golden color. It was fairly clear with about a finger of a thick white head. It left a fair amount of lacing. Nose is mainly wheat. Some earthy hops, citrus and spiciness. It has a pretty smooth taste. Hints of grains, some malt, wheat and faint spices. Not bad at all."
"Overall this is a very well balanced brew that is a real treat. Definitely recommended. Thanks again Wes!"
""
""
"For those who like their Wit's expressive and full flavored, this one's for you. Big, bold clove is all up in this shit and then some. Plus it's packing one of the best mouthfeels this side of the Ol' Miss. Another accomplishment from one of the best breweries in America."
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed the lightness and parallel complexity of this beer. Casual, sophisticated, and balanced. I personally would have liked to experienced a more potent flavor, the flavor at the end felt a bit watered down. If you know someone who feels intimidated by craft beer, this could be the beer that is not overwhelming and very welcoming to the dainty pallet."

"O- A good witbier but nothing special to be honest. A little disappointing from Great Lakes but I only bought one so I cant complain."
""
"O- This one did not disappoint in the least. Way to go Great Lakes!"
""
""
"Overall, there is not a lot going on. It is on-point for style, but lacking memorable texture or flavor."
""

"O: This and Oberon always mean summer is right around the corner. Overall a well-seasoned light easy to drink beer."

"Overall, a nice easy drinking wit. Decent amount of flavor. Good beer for the hot days."
""

"Mouthfeel: This is a beer that I prefer to be a bit thinner than normal and it doesn’t disappoint my thinking easy drinking and rather smooth a very well made white."

"Overall, it was a leaning to the side of spiciness which is not really my cup of tea. I thought it was good and refreshing, but I don't expect to pick it up again."
"The Holy Moses Witbier is quite tasty!!! the appearance is a cloudy yellow beer with good carbonation that forms a nice frothy head that dissipates and laces throughout the draw. The smell includes spice, clove, and hints of citrus. The taste starts with clove, then lemon citrus, then finishes with a punch of spice which comes of the pallet clean. The mouthfeel is very good, at 5.4% it makes a decent session ale especially on a warmer day. Stay thirsty my friends."
"A style that isn't a favorite of mine, but this one is a very drinkable beer."
"Hazy straw color with a solid white head. Rather bubbly. Spicy and citrusy in the nose; some coriander and orange peel. Has a flavor of breaded malts, yeast, and wheat. Citrus less apparent than in the aroma. Slight hint of chamomile. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with the right amount of carbonation. A very well-done wit."
"Overall: Not much here to this beer, has a good feel and color but other than that it leaves a lot to be desired"
"Light bodied, a very summery beer, refreshing! The chamomile scent is quite interesting."
"Taste - Corainder, chamomile, and bread with a nice spike of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is fairly medium, even medium-heavy, but carbonation levels are a bit sluggish for this, leaving things a bit tired. Finish is quite dry."
"O: A pretty decent witbier. Light and refreshing, though not terribly complex."
"Mouth-feel is thin,beer is refreshing, leaves little other than lemon peel behind on the tongue. AN easy to drink wheat beer, this would make an decent drink for a hot summer day outdoors."
"Excellent summer beer and a good take on the style."
"Overall this was pretty good. I will be drinking this again next summer."
"Drinkability: A good summer brew, and tasted very fresh on tap. Would definitely drink this one again when offered on tap."
"A nice, unexpected find on tap, and an enjoyable brew for first Great Lakes offering!"
"This brew has a great drinkability. Its light enough that you can drink a few, and yet heavy enough for you to enjoy a great brew. Another great brew by Great Lakes Brewing Company"
"Overall: Great little summer wit! It has a nice amount of funk and complexity, but never fails at being very well balanced and easy drinking. I will definitely be picking up another sixer."
"Definitely worth a try."
"The aftertaste really makes the spicy notes shine, which is a good thing and leaves you thirsty."
"Pours a slightly-cloudy golden color with a single-finger white head that sticks around for a bit and is quite creamy. Nice spotty lacing as it falls to a thin cap. Nose brings a good dosage of wheat plus some light citrus and spice. Flavor has a bit too much spice and doesn't showcase the malt and citrus character enough. Light body with crisp carbonation and a dry bit of coriander in the finish. Pretty good brew from Great Lakes."
"Pours a hazed yellow gold with cap of soapy white head. Scent is of lightly musty dried grain, moderate amounts of white bread and peppery spice and very faint notes of lemongrass. Taste folows scent, pale dried and lightly musty grain, white-breadyness, firm black pepper and only a faint presence of lemon rind, somewhat bitter finish and only lightly sweet. Medium bodied and creamy, like many other beers from this great brewery, somewhat dry finnish to this one. A wheat beer with a very mild approach to sweetness and citrus, letting the grains and yeast to do most of the talking."
"O: Not really all that great for a witbier. Sort of lacking the typical flavors."
"First, let me say I am a GLBC fan and of witbier, but not ofHoly Moses. My nose sent off warning signals when I took a whiff, but it looked good in a pilsner glass. There was not one distinctive taste that jumped out at me, but the overall spiciness was too much. It felt smooth in my mouth and throat, but the aftertaste was not refreshing. I would never drink this again."
"Overall I thought this was an average Witbier. It was ok but not great and I feel like that is because of the heavy amount of spices in the beer, a little spice can go a long way and it seems like there was just to many spices in this beer, it wasn't as bad as Harpoons Winter Warmer but most of the flavors in the beer got drowned out by the spices. I liked the look, mouthfeel and drinkability the most about this beer. I liked the large amount of spices in this beer the least. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there are many other widely available Witbier's that have better balance. If you are a die hard Witbier fan and like your beers heavily spiced then you might want to give this a try but I wouldn't put that much effort into it. I can't say this beer is as solid as the rest of their lineup and it could use some tweaking, so far this has been my least favorite brew from them. As far as Witbiers go I wouldn't turn it down if I was offered one but I feel like Blue Moons Grand Cru was better and more balanced making that still my favorite Witbier to date."
"Overall - A good witbier, like I said, the spicyness can give a little too much kick, but it's still a tasty beer."
"I have concerns with trying new witbiers as most are subpar and the style doesn't leave a lot to experiment with. Wits are either a good or bad interpretation of a pretty well-defined flavor profile. I like the balance on this one, though I prefer them to be a little bolder."
"o - a pretty enjoyable brew overall and represents the style well. i had sworn off wheat beers after trying most of the more popular brands, but this one makes me think i should revisit this category."
"O: Overall this was a crisp and light refreshing beer that would be perfect after mowing the lawn or sitting on the deck on a nice summer day."
"O- Overall a really solid brew and very easy to drink."
"O- Just not impressed. Too much chamomile. This felt more like an experimental, than a Wit"
"Fuller bodied than expected with lots of bready yeast and a crisp, spicy character up front that lingers over the earthy and sweet notes into a slightly dry finish. Hints of coriander and pepper along with earthy, grassy hops which are balanced by sweet notes of apple and lemon. Well balanced, refreshing and it tastes better than it looks and smells."
"A lot of white ales strike me as being very mediocre. However, I would put this one in the very good category, though it is not the best version of the style that I have ever had. Just like almost every other Great Lakes brew that I have tried, this one is very well made and will not let you down."
"O: I wish the chamomile meter was a little lower on this brew, but all in all, interesting and well-crafted. But one is more than enough."
"Overall -- Pretty good. Not amazing, and I would still take many other year-round wits to this one, but it wasn't a disappointment."
"Light bodied, proper carbonation, easy to drink a few bottles of this with no problem. A good Witbeer from Great Lakes. Would have scored higher if the citrus aroma and flavor were both a little stronger."
"Overall – While it's not a spectacular beer, I really have no complaints about it. The flavour is well balanced, and it's very drinkable. I could definitely put back a few of these on a patio sometime this summer."
"Great form of a classy summer beer."
"O: I pass. One of the lesser favorites from Great Lakes"
"o: not a huge fan - the sweet wheaty, white bread character is dominant and not so delicious, lacking in the subtle balance of spice, yeast, malt, and hop that makes a great wit"
"Presents two fingers of bleached white microfoam, light and airy, delicate dimpling effect as it dissolves, decent retention and the lacing too sticks around a touch longer than expected. Pale yet bright straw yellow colored liquid, considerable amount of bubbles whirling around as well as fine particulate matter, certainly plays the part visually. Unusually thick and dewy nose, lemon to orange juice and reduction, coriander and cinnamon spice, croissant dough and fresh yeast, lemongrass and violets, apricot, peach and some banana fruit, the chamomile semi-muted. Medium-bodied plus, feels fluffy and very expansive, the carbonation helping it fill the mouth entirely. The clove, coriander, cumin to black pepper spice gives it verve and here the lemon, orange citrus drier and with more zing. There is a bitterness in the grassy element, more pronounced as it warms. Yeast, pie dough, honey comes through, finishes sweeter with elevating apricot, peach, apple fruit. The flavors are deep if not especially complex, what makes the beer is the alternation of textures, very tactilely engaging."
"Even though I feel there's something missing in Holy Moses compared to better witbiers, it's refreshing enough and at least worth a shot...especially in the raging heat of summer."
"O. Easy drinking but overall pretty disappointing. I had high expectations for this beer given the overall positive reviews. Can't say I'll be buying another 6-pack."
"An interesting beer, and a well crafted beer, just not something I could get excited for."
"I think I liked this better on tap. I'm sure the score could be bumped had there been a better pour into a better glass, and the carbonation wasn't as high."
"As I mentioned above, I've had this on tap 3-4 times already this year, and I can definitely say that this is a much better tasting beer on tap than it is from the bottle. I had this from the bottle a year or two ago, and was not that impressed. When it was offered o tap recently, I tried it reluctantly, remembering my experience from a year or two, but was pleasantly surprised. So, if you can get this on tap, do so! From the bottle, however (which is what this review is), then, eh, it is ok."
"O: A bit disappointed in this offering from GLBC, which is my favorite brewery. I expected more refreshment from a beer of this style. But instead, my takeaway here is just a watered-down Belgian. Drinkability is high, for what that's worth, but it definitely leaves me unimpressed. A rare miss from GLBC."
"Overall: A very solid take on a witbier from Great Lakes. This might be the best summer release I've had so far."
"O. Refreshing and mild. A good beer to share with those who are still getting into beer, as the flavor doesn't punch you in the face and the ABV isn't overwhelming."
"Overall I would buy this again and if in a variety case would love it. I believe I got an uber fresh bottle with a best by ""10/2/11"" must have been bottled weeks ago straight from the source in Ohio. Great Lakes does it again. Yum."
"Another solid brew from Great Lakes!"
"The body is light and manageable, with a solid carbonation level. The overall experience with this beer is about what I'd expect from an american wit: it is a palatable summer beer that any beer drinker could crack open and enjoy. Nothing special, but nothing unpleasant."
"This beer is light-flavored, easy drinking, and a perfect companion on a hot sunny Sunday afternoon. A real thirst-quencher. I couldn't drink it fast enough."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is two inches of fluffy white foam that recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is coriander, lemon, bitter orange peel, and tangy wheat. This is exactly what I want in the aroma of a witbier. The taste is a bit spicier than the aroma with a lot of coriander and a hint of cardamom. It also has a strong wheat presence, and some lemon. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately high refreshing carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this just might be the best witbier I have ever tasted. I will be drinking a lot of this while it is around."
"This is a pretty good wit, plenty of flavor. Might be a little heavy for a longer session, but putting down 2 or 3 shouldn't be an issue. A nice option to have for the summer months."
"Overall a very refreshing and enjoyable Witbier."
"O- a great witbier with alot of spice ,very drinkable"
"Overall - This beer is what summertime is all about, only problem is its released to early and done too soon. This needs to come out june-ish and finish up in august, so you could drink this at bbq's, at the beach and at summer gatherings. This beer crushes blue moon with it smoothness and fruity flavors. Very nice witbier that anyone can enjoy."
"Notes: Again pleasantly surprised by one of the most unassuming Great Lakes brews. Another quality offering worth keeping in mind for a fresh and quaffable wheat drink."
"Overall: This is a great Witbier. Summit Scandia was my favorite Wit (RIP, but I have the nice glass as a memento), but this is probably now the next best thing. My only gripe (and it is a minor one), is that it could be a tad drier."
"D - Another quality brew from Great Lakes; probably the best Witbier I've had"
"Pours a pale straw color with a very white thin head. Very light aromas of cream, lemon, orange and spice. The taste is still fairly light, but more robust than the aromas. More lemon and orange, not much spice, and a nice creaminess. Not quite as effervescent or crisp as some Wits, but some nice subtle creamsicle notes going on here. Nice summer beer."
"A great beer to enjoy after mowing the lawn!"
"This beer pours out a yellowish cloudy body with a thick whitehead that has good retention, lacing and carbonation. The smell consists of some spices, orange peel, yeast, and bread. I could picture myself enjoying this with some orange, or lemon flavored bread or muffins. The taste starts out with a biscuit like taste that quickly follows with some citrus, and orange peel. After that the spices and coriander takes over and finishes off with a nice bread taste. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and has some bite to it thanks to the spices. Holy Moses, this has got to be perhaps the best witbier I have tried and the taste is much more balanced than some other ones that either had too much spiciness or too much citrus in it. I'll gladly be drinking this one many more times in the upcoming months."
"O: Good, another fantastic style from great lakes."
"O: A zesty, drinkable summer beer."
"TRY THIS REFRESHING BREW!"
"Too bad this thing was loaded with diacetyl it just overpowered everything. It even had a veggie character to it which reminded me of melted butter on top of cooked veggies, such as brussel sprouts. In a way I don't mind it, but something is off here."
"O- A refreshing witbier that tastes pretty traditional and is a fantastic spring/summer brew."
"When poured into a pint glass it has a nice hazy orange color with a little white head that lays down to a nice thin lace around the top. The aroma is nice and inviting with some spices and coriander. The taste is nice a crisp, i taste some clove and banana. Goes down nice and smooth with not flavors that linger. Very nice mouth feel and is overall a good beer."
"This has always been a goodie from Great Lakes. Yes, they have better offerings.. but if you're into witbiers, it's a must."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours hazy amber color with a small white head that recedes quickly. Aromas of spices, floral, and citrus. Taste of nice herbal spices and citrus. Light to medium carbonation with medium body. Citrus and herbal flavors linger on the finish. This is a very good Witbier!"
"All in all, this is a good brew. Not great, but good to try once if you like lighter, less intense beers. Not overwhelming flavor, but decent flavors kicking around. Try once if you like the style."
"D-high, I was a bit put off by the date and the fact that it's November, but if I could find this throughout the summer, I'd try to always have it around...."
"M: Less than stellar. Carbonation is a bit low for the style leaving the body rather thin. Finish is fine except for a slight bitterness I don't expect from the style. I'm used to a dry to medium sweet and spicy finish."
"Really psyched to get my grubby MA hands on this one, a gift from my mid west connection. Poured into a goblet, pours an opaque, cloudy orange wiht a nice fluffy head. Smells of bananna, clove and bubblegum going on. Nice sweet taste with a mild hop profile, real nice balance. Definitely another great beer from one of my favorite breweries, if I could get my hands on it it would be in the fridge all summer."
"This would be a great summertime brew - as expected. Highly drinkable, which is no suprise. Overall definitely worthy of a case if you're looking for the style."
"A moderate pour yields a half inch of white foam that settles to a single layer. Brew is hazy yellow and fairly carbonated, ton of bubbles on the glass, but it settles down after a few minutes. Smell has a light sweetness, yeast, citrus, spice. Taste as a good bite of cinnamon/ clove and mixed hop, fairly light sweet body. Feel is a bit thin. Finishes with lingering stale cinnamon and a bit of citrus rind."
"Tatse is orange and honey followed by corriander and balanced by a bitter orange peel finnish. Tatse is good but the mouth feel is even better - good carbonation, nice pop to the flavors. A quality beer."
"Wow, what a complete exedous from other Great Lakes brews. The appearance was biblical in nature and the smell tempted me to write a letter to the Thessalonians explaining the word. The brew tastes like it used water from Nazareth and the mouthfeel was a complete revelation. As for the drinkability, I feel like I've been commanded to drink 10 of them."
"D - Good, again, from Great Lakes, it's not stand out but nice regardless. The spice seems just a touch heavy but important in the final product regardless."
"D- This beer was crisp and refreshing. Not as light as I think it should have been. A good drinking beer that has a lighter ABV so it is very sessionable."
"d was a good brew except for the after taste that kind of threw me off"
"This is a very good witbier; has a nice coriander flavor coupled with the spice. A very well done brew, and very sessionable. Great Lakes is a tremendous brewer, another great brew from them."
"As far as wits go, I approve of this one. Very refreshing. It's not so sweet as to be cloying, but still incorporates all that's great about wits."
"D- At 5.4% alc, with a great mouth feel, and lighter witbier taste make it a worthy session beer to keep in mind on a scorcher of a day."
"Quite refreshing - a full bodied Wit with a great balance of flavors"
"Bottle. Poured into a weizen glass. Pours a slightly cloudy colored straw yellow color with a 1 finger pure white head. The nose is a mix betwee the fruit of a belgian along with the spice. Surprisingly this beer is slightly tart at the beginning then transitions to the classic belgian yeast flavors. The flavor ends rather abruptly and cleanly. Light/medium mouthfeel. NOt a strong flavored beer nor heavy tasting but rather in my opinion a good everyday pedestrian belgian white that doesn't go too far."
"Drinks nicely. A couple of these would work nicely on a warm day. Personally, I would reach for a hefe, but this one would appeal to many people even BMC drinkers. A nice brew."
"The beer is a nice hazy yellow, with a nice rocky with head. The smell is floral, spicy and a touch of Belgian yeast. Ok the taste is floral and peppery with some big grassy notes. The beer is very dry and the carbonation is not quite right. The beer is not hard to drink, but reminds me of chimay white."
"Pours a cloudy, pale gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of wheat, sweet malt, hops, spice, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of clove, wheat, sweet malt, and floral hops. Overall, onyl complaint is a slight wateriness to the mouth feel."
"D: Overall, a good beer but not one that stands out for the style. I'll take a local like Allagash White over this any day"
"D: Easy drinking, the 5.4% ABV is masked well enough where you don't even taste it. I don't know if I would buy this again, but I wouldn't turn one away if somebody gave me one."
"D: Very drinkable and summery great for grilling , had mine with some grilled walleye."
"D- Overall not a bad beer, would be nice to drink on a summer day, pretty good flavor for what it is, but it is nothing to stop buying new beers because of :)"
"I drank this without food, but could imagine it tasting great as part of a hearty brunch, perhaps with a spicy omlette."
"Pours a very nice pale, with some decent head and nice lacing. Great scent, with a nice semi-sweet maltiness and a great spiciness -- some orange and a nice slight pepperiness. Excellent flavor, with the same attributes as the aroma; has a very nice lasting quality that gives the tongue a nice fresh burst through the end. Goes down decent, a very nice white ale."
"D-this is a very tasty brew, big flavors and well put together. another tasty brew from great lakes."
"A very ok vitbier, not worth drinking."
"Notes: An awesome beer that I was happy to have snagged a single of; now it is available in 6 packs around town. Going to be buying more."
"When I was a freshman in college and hell even in high school I used to drink a lot of blue moon. When a buddy introduced me to Holy Moses I was literallly blown away. I thought that this was the greatest beer ever at the time. A couple months ago I found a 12 pack and was in a very nostalgic OMG they started bottling this again. I was trully giddy like a school girl. I have had many more beers since then and I must say that this beer is still good on a hot summer day but it just doesn't do it for me anymore. I taste the coriander and the orange peel but then the rest is just an american lager feel to it. Honestly though it is a good beer and I think going the blue moon route and sticking an orange peel in it may be worth it. Nonetheless its a great beer for summer but no gumballhead."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability is good, it's a good flavored easy drinking beer. The citrus flavor makes it pretty refreshing and nice to drink on this extremely hot day."
"Overall: A very refreshing, easy drinker from Great Lakes. I'm glad they brought this one back."
"Fine Witbier for hot/humid summer days."
"This is very drinkable, and my wife likes it too. I will have a few of these this summer."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is just plain weak. It slides down the throat as aggressively as a Sierra Mist with as much aftertaste as well. This is a reasonably drinkable beer, however for the price, Hoegaarden and many other better witbiers are available."
"D: Good, clean, very easy going down. This beer is great for a hot summer day, though in the end slightly boring. A good beer, and well crafted, but not amazing. A solid beer from a solid brewery."
"Poured a deep, clear yellow with a thick white head. Although just a thin cap, very nice head retention with ample wet lacings. Although advertised to have a big floral aroma, generally the aromas were faint - wheat, sweet citrus and a very faint hint of coriander. Creamy smooth feel with very refreshing carbonation. A few different flavors are present, but none of them dominate. Sweet wheat malt beginning followed by light citrus/banana flavor and a light spicy/coriander finish. Very smooth and well balanced. I'm a rookie to this style so don't have much for comparison. Expected more spice, but appreciated it wasn't overspiced...which is my experience with pumpkin ales. Very drinkable and refreshing on a hot day like today."
"Pours an almost clear golden straw. Superfine white head. Smell is complex, fruity and floral and malty altogether. Very nice. Feels smooth and bitter. A good backing intensified by chamomile, but with a citrusy edge on the end. Easily drinkable. Quite good, and an excellent wit in its own right."
"D - Pretty solid overall. It isn't my usual sort of thing but Great Lakes pretty much nailed it for the style."
"All things considered, I thought this a pretty decent wit style beer, and one that is perfect for drinking through the hot summer months out here."
"Admitedly I am not a huge fan of the style, but when done right I am a major appreciator. I think overall this is a nice representation but is just kind of average for me. ours a nice brighter cloudy yellow with a big head. Npse is spices, corriander, banana, and yeast. Taste is a milder synthesis of those that does not overwhelm but plays with the tastebuds. Finish is somewhat dry. Drinkability isn'r great for a of these things for me. Its just OK."
"Overall: The most bitter and herbal witbier I've had. I don't particular like this version better than other ones, but Holy Moses is a good beer."
"D - An interesting Witbier offering from the folks at Great Lakes... Much fuller and richer than most of its peers... The chamomile also adds intriguing character and a certain soothing quality... Real easy drinking and a nice seasonal offering..."
"Good tasty beer for warm weather. Nice wit, not the best I've had but up there and worth trying. Would be easy enough to session."
"Pours a hazy yellow to goldish color with a one finger head which resedes to skim with spotty lacing. The aroma is of wheat malt with hints of banana and citrus. The taste has a wheat malt backbone with hints of citrus, bananas, floral hops, and i detect a little green apple flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and crisp. Overall it is a good solid beer, not the best in its class, but a solid flavor that has nothing to dislike about it. You would go back for a second."
"Pours a hazy pale straw-yellow colour with a nice white head and spotty lacing. Smells of wheat, clove and faint banana. Taste has a lot of banana sweetness to go with the wheat flavour. A tiny bit of hops are noticeable. Nice carbonation level. A very refreshing summer beer, but nothing outstanding for a wit."
"Drinkability: A ho-hum wheat beer. Great Lakes is a great brewery and honestly I expected more."
"Tastes lightly peppry and mildly bananaish, moving into a yeastier, spicier middle and ending on a kick of straight-up banana tinged OJ with alcohol and yeast lingering. Wowzers. I honestly don't remember ever having had a tastier wit."
"D - Very drinkable beer, good for the summertime. Very reasonably priced."
"Poured a hazy straw yellow with a nicely retaining white head. Spotty lacing. Delicious oranges, clove, and coriander in the nose with a touch of tartness. Very inviting. The taste was a little on the weaker side though. Was looking for a bit more flavor here, but the spices came through very well. A delicate bitterness in the finish holds the sweetness in check. Touch of honey, citrus, and spice throughout. Nicely carbonated, just a slight prickle on the tongue, with a crisp body. Pretty good overall."
"Holy Moses! Sorry, I couldn't resist. This guy pours a hazy pale golden straw with half a finger of white foamy head on top. The smell is of orange peel, coriander, wheat, banana, clove, and cracked pepper. A slight yeastiness is also perceptibly trying to squeeze through from beneath, but to only partial avail. The taste is very similar, though the grains and spices are more separated than public facilities following Plessey v Ferguson (too soon?). The first wave consists of the wheat and orange peel; the second of coriander, cardamom, pepper, clove, and even a strange hint of salt. The banana is only mildly there, as though he's got somehwere better to be, constantly looking at his watch and tweeting the time away while everyone else has the time of their lives. Some people, y'know? The body is decidedly medium, with an active carbonation that comes in briefly but strongly in a sudden burst of effervescence. I'm not much of a fan of that, but the overall taste and effect keep the drinkability from being shredded by the wanton CO2 assault."
"Drinkability: Reasonably well done, but not the best in style. Wouldn't quite hold up to a whole session, but it could be rotated in."
"D - A very good beer and one that I will definitely buy every spring."
"D - Another good work from Great Lakes. Makes for an excellent summer beer."
"D: A nice refreshing White Ale that produced pleasant sweetness but balanced it out with enough bitterness."
"Holy Moses looks good, a big bright yellow glow coming from the glass once filled, i mean this is bright, with some fainter white patches if you imagine it. The head is thick ecru ivory white dense foam that looks scrumptious in it's own right. Semi small squigglys going down. Smell is pretty much on the style, big amounts of coriander, slight clove, wheat and some small earthy floral hops. Taste is great, this is refreshing, to say the least. A nice light sweet malt along with wheat and the afformentioned spices. Like I said, on par. The feel is smooth, light, easyt going, inviting, not complex, beer in it's lightest form, easy stuff here. The drinkability on this is well, if they made 40's of this, I would buy them up, great stuff for the season. Cheers!"
"Drinkability- It goes down well but I tend to bore of the flavor after a few of these so I would be ready to grab something else. I see this being a great beer for a hot summer day."
"D: FANTASTIC. Plus an excellent representation of the style in my opinion. Great Lakes consistently produces incredible brews."
"This is very light but crisp, a very refreshing beer. Should be one of the go to beers for this summer, i've got an old friend back again."
"Not my favourite Great Lakes offering due to the slight misfire on the body, but still far superior to most other offerings in the field. Good work fellas!"
"Cheers."
"Smooth and easy drinking."
"D - Delicious and refreshing summer beer. One of the best witbiers I've had. Highly recommended."
"Conclusion: This was my first GL brew; I got to try EF up at an Indian restaurant in Kalamazoo; I must say, that was the kind of quality I was expecting with all the hype this brewery gets. Holy Moses...meh, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. $10.00 is definitely too much to pay for a sixer of this; I'd rather have Hoegaarden or Boulevard's Zon over this for 1-3 bucks less."
"Overall, quite a decent example of a Belgian style wit and a very nice summer beer. Though I know it isn't the same style, this is often compared to Oberon in the parts where I live, and I will say I prefer this over Oberon."
"overall: its an interesting beer. not one that i would think about ordering alot but it was good. Deff. a nice seasonal spring beer, light crisp, clean, and refreshing. Received as a congraduations for good grades this semseter and drank after a large meal at chipolte. It will be the first of maybe beers a rate this summer."
"The few GLBC brews I have had I have found to be oustanding. This one was good, but a notch below the first four I've had - Dortmunder, Ness, Fitzgerald, and Burning River."
"Drinkability: The high carbonation does a great thing when the beer is drank with a meal - it cleans the palate completely. When I had this in a shaker pint I think I got more of the flavor, but overall - I find this is a one a time beer. It is refreshing and goes great with a meal, and maybe even for savoring slowly - but just one. After that I'm done. I'm not complaining mind you - it's good, just not ""give me another one right now!"" or ""I wish this would never end"" good."
"Nicely quaffable. Too safe to be mentioned in the same sentence as beers like St B's and Allagash White, I'd like to see them kick this up a notch."
"Drinkability: Quite a good beer, and overall I really like it. Great Lakes has yet to let me down. The only thing that I found to be a bit of a downer is the slight metallic twinge in it, but that's easy to get by considering all the other great aspects. The ABV is pretty moderate at 5.4%, so it's not as if this beer is going to get you hammered, so one could easily get through a couple with little to no problem."
"M/D: Very creamy texture but still very easy to drink. Nice balance of good flavor and refreshment."
"D- An easy drinking witbier, although it is a little on the mild side. Well made and worth trying."
"overall this beer is very drinkable and enjoyable. I would definatly try again and think it would be a great beer to drink in the summer."
"D - Definitely a good easy drinking White Ale, I would drink this again."
"Rather light-bodied and very refreshing and drinkable. Nice warm weather brew."
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple inches of white head. It is gold with suspended yeast. The aroma is banana and clove, maybe some lemon. The taste is much the same. It has a medium body. It is very refreshing. It is another solid beer from Great Lakes."
"Taste is very fruity and bready. Lots of light sweet malt but very smooth and wheaty. Mouthfeel is full and crisp. Real light and easy drinking beer."
"D: Very good, even for the style."
"It's been a while since I've had Holy Moses. I wasn't overly excited to see it back in the lineup, but it is clearly better than than Grassroots Ale. To be fair, I'm not much of a Witbier fan. In terms of style, there's nothing wrong with Holy Moses. But, it still seems rather underwhelming in terms of overall flavor. It is easy drinking, and would make for a nice beer on a hot day. But, it's not something I'd drink regularly. If you're into Witbiers, give it a try. If not, you'll probably view it like I do...meh. I am pleased to see Grassroots Ale out of the rotation for the moment. Just sayin'...."
"I'm trying not to overrate this one, but it's simply too good to ignore. The style is generally not my first choice, but it's performed extremely well here, with alternating excitement and balance. Probably the best wit I've ever tasted, and the best one made in America."
"D- VERY drinkable. I could see myself enjoying many of these on a warm night on the patio. Delicious and smooth. Another very solid offering from Great Lakes."
"The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with an average amount of carbonation. The body is not too thick, fairly light. Definitely easy to drink, something that goes down easily on a warm spring day."
" I love all of Great Lakes offerings and this is no exception, not a huge fan of this style but have to say this brew is not bad at all, goes down super quick and easy and has a nice taste that hangs on for just the right amount of time! Definetly worth a try if ya see it."
"An odd mouthfeel for a wit. mild carbonation level."
"Poured hazy, light yellow with a modest head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma is wheaty banana. The taste is surprisingly lemony citrus with a banana background. Feel is just barely medium bodied with a tiny amount of carbonation. Drinkability is very good. You can pound these suckers."
"This is a solid wit and well worth a try."
"Great Lakes Holy Moses pours a lemon yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is spicy and citrusy. The flavor is also spicy and citrusy in classic wit fashion. This is one of the better wit beers that I've had. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Good and tasty."
"D - Light, easy-drinking Witbier with a spicy flair and fairly substantial hop bitterness for the style. I have been consistently impressed with Great Lakes recently."
"It was a nice color for a white ale but it wasn't quite as white as maybe I had thought it would be. More of a yellowish tint to it. It was a great beer it smelled just like any other witbier I've had, but the interesting spicey flavors and the chamomile that I swore I could taste gave it some interesting initial and aftertastes. Over all I think it was a great beer and as always a nice story from Great Lakes."
"A cloudy pale orange color pour with a thick fluffy white head that lasted quite a while. Pleasent Belgian yeasty aromas of banana,light pepper & coriander spice,maybe some candi sugar aromas.Flavor has all of the same characteristics of the aroma but is stronger on the coriander and has some orange peel in there as well,nice wheaty malt backbone,light hoppy bitterness is noticable in the end. The feel is light and well carbonated,flavor is quite balanced. This is a darn good brew,too bad they have retired it."
"An easy drinking wit from Great Lakes. Though the flavor tends to be a bit washed out."
"Solidly drinkable, full flavoured wit. Looks good with a hazy yellow/orange liquid and sticky crowning head of white foam. A little bit of lacing clings to the glass. Nose is spices and orange and hints of honey. Leans towards the sweet side with lots of citrus and soft banana-like flavours. Smooth body and light carbonation. Very easy drinking, balanced and tasty brew."
"Well done, Great Lakes! Bravo!"
" ~ As far as a wheat beers go this is a unique in it having a srong bitter flavor. This is not a classic wheat brew. It's not bad but it's not for me."
"Prosit, MK"
"(rated Sep 17, 2008)"
"Drinkability: As usual, another solid beer from Great Lakes. I often forget just how good these guys are."
"Overall, it is a very nice beer from pour to aroma to tasting and finishing. I drank this in the colder part of the Irish winter and it went down well and I could imagine that it would be nice on a summer day too. I'll definitely recommend this and try it again-well done Great Lakes Brewing Co."
"Pours a cloudy light gold in color. Frothy ring of head settles around the perimeter of the glass. Initial smell is yeast and spice. There's a lot more spice in the flavor. Some bittering hops and sharp spices. Not a whole lot of fruit flavor, but some floral notes are present. A little thin in mouthfeel, but it's refreshing and clean."
"D - very enjoyable, it's a shame this brew will become only seasonal but then again it's one to look forward to."
"D: I thought the strong chamomile made this a winner for me. I just love that clean, floral, grassy nose and flavor. Just smelling it makes me feel calm. I found it quite drinkable. I'd really like to try it in the summer. Seems a perfect drink for a hot day. Witbier is not my first choice in style but I am going to re-visit this one for sure. Great Lakes really does have a well rounded menu of offerings at this point in time."
"Damn! There's all kinds of flavor right off from when it first touches the lips. Lemony bite backed up with a fresh out of the banana bread like warmth. In the middle there a crisp and bold spiciness courtesy of the coriander and especially the chamomile which add a very interesting complexity to the brew. Not overly sweet like a lot of the American takes can be nor that almost artificial citrus flavoring taste that a lot of them have. The mouth feel is full and fluffy. Not thin & fizzy but not superthick either. It finishes clean and just a slight sweet tang."
"Pours a beautifully white color, probably one of the truly ""whitest"" beer I've ever had. Has a very impressive frothy white head that bubbles around with a texture a lot like whipped cream. Very hazy unfiltered look to it. Light, clean orange and grains of paradise aroma with a little pepperiness to it. Very German flavor to it for a Belgian style, especially with the big frothy head. Reminds me of sitting at bars during the summer in berlin. Extrordinarily dry base for the spices with a crisp finish. A little clove like yeast flavor like a hefe. Pretty complex but not overly delicious. Mouthfeel is very smooth from the wheat and a nice level of carbonation. Since it's so light you can drink a lot of it but I'm still looking for a little more flavor like you find in a good hefeweizen or Belgian wit. Maybe a little more alcohol or a little sweetness, either from the yeast or from a little higher mash temp. Still a nice beer."
"I thought it was funny how the side of the label said it was made from ""barley hops yeast and water"" but elsewhere on the label it said it included ""spices and chamomile""."
"D- an easy session beer. worth trying every so often."
"Mostly clear with a careful pour, but it's not necessary to avoid the sediment. Not off tastes there, just stronger. Medium-light gold with a medium-sized, pillowy, white, slowly-diminishing head. Smells of fruit followed closely behind by bready malt and yeast and some very light spice. Taste is of light, crisp, fruity citrus up front with a spicy finish. Coriander, then clove. It has a medium-light body, slightly creamy texture and moderate carbonation. This is one of the brewery's best offerings. Definitely worth a try."
"D: I could drink tons, only if it was fresh."
"Poured a hazy golden straw color with whisps of yeasty dirst swirling around and a good amount of carbonation sticking to the side of the glass. The small and foamy white head didn't stick around for long. The sweet nose is full of yeast, orange, and belgian-like spices. Fairly straightforward but there is an odd harsh wheat flavor to it and I don't believe it to be bitterness from the hops. Perhaps this is over spiced for some people but I still find it pleasant and semi-refreshing. Slick but moderate feel with a lot of tingly carbonation. Feels like your drinking an alka seltzer drink. Fairly drinkable but kinda weird?"
"D- 5.4% makes it decently sessionable. I would definitely drink this again."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy yellowish color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is citrusy, maybe grapefruit, spices, and maybe a hint of grain. Flavor is sweet initially, with a slight bitter finish. Light on the palate and very drinkable. Not a bad beer."
"Pours the typical ghostly pale orange witbier color. Has a pure white head that dissipated into a thin yet rocky cap. The aroma is very nice. Good Belgian yeast aromas, banana, and light pepper & coriander spice. Some candi sugar aromas as well. The taste has all of the same characteristics of the aroma but is stronger on the coriander and has some orange peel as well. A light hoppy bitterness is noticable in the end. The feel is light and well carbonation, finishes balanced; starts off sweet and ends bitter. This is a great witbier as it is not dominated by coriander and orange peel, which I prefer. Flavors are pretty much spot on with an added hoppiness in the end."
"D: A very refreshing beer, ideal for a hot summer day. I'm not a huge fan of the style but it seems very true to the style. Much better/more complex than a basic wheat beer, might be difficult to pass off on a BMC drinker unlike a regular wheat. Recommended."
"D= A damn good witbier, great to have a few of these on a hot summer day."
"D: Very high. I could drink this all day."
"Notes: One of the more drinkable GLBC beers."
"Now this is pretty hoppy for a white ale. Nice beer overall. It pours with a nice white head of smallish bubbles that retain well and form a nice lacing. The color is yellowish orange and very cloudy. The nose is subtle orange, and on the palate the first impression is the lively carbonation bite, followed immediately by orange spiced with coriander, but with an appreciable hop bitterness. The hops, general dryness, and high carbonation join forces to help this one to finish very crisply, with a pleasant clean bitter aftertaste."
"This is a very drinkable brew. It has a great balance between sweet and bitter. With a low ABV, I can see myself putting a few of these away on sunny, humid afternoon overlooking a large body of water."
"A beer for the mix drink makers, its too sweet for my blood for some reason."
"T: Having just drank a Hoegaarden before this beer, my opinion and score of it suffer a little by direct comparison. This is a great witbier, but comes up a little thinner and little more spicy than the Hoegaarden and just isn't as enjoyable. Strong with orange and lemon flavors with a spicy background. Not quite as much of a wheat or yeast flavor as the Hoegaarden. Very refreshing, pleasant take on witbier, but not my favorite GLBC beer."
"Great Lakes has yet to let me down so i picked up a few. This is a very good witbier. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with a thick head that dwindles down. Powerful carbonation and some really great lacing as well. In the glass this beer almost looks like honey. The aroma is thick with coriander and citrus fruits, I also picked up some bitterness from the aroma. I let the head die down before I took my first sip. This beer feels crisp and pleasant. Overall good citrus flavors complimented by spices. The first one I had on its own, and my second one had a slice of fresh lemon. Both ways were good but the lemon really added to the overall flavor. I recommend trying a few of these, make sure they are cold and you will enjoy one seriously refreshing witbier."
"Note: That nectarine taste becomes stronger as you work your way through this beer and its pretty cool to taste but the tea like flavors sort of dull my overall interest in this beer."
"PS: High carbonation, which can be a bit prickely at low temperatures."
"Light on body, big on flavor. This is highly drinkable for any occasion IMO. Playing 18 holes? Bring a sixer along. Just want a sipper on a quiet evening? Go for it!"
"D - This is a perfect summer beer, easy to drink and refreshing. I could drink a couple of these easily."
"D - Another great beer from Great Lakes. I don't know if I would buy just a sixer of this for $8.50. But getting the 12 bottle variety pack (with burning river,Eliot Ness, and Edmund Fitzgerald) for $12.99 was an absolute steal!!! I could easily see enjoying a few of these on a warm night with friends...."
"Not as good as some other wits I've had, but really quite drinkable."
"Notes: This is one of the more complex witbiers that I have tried so far. It also had a nice calming effect on me that after a long day of work. (It must have been the chamomile.) Well done, I will need to get some more of this ale."
"Very drinkable; I will probably grab a case of this."
"This poured a hazy, cloudy yellow color with foamy white head that dissipated fairly slowly. Aroma is citrusy and spicey. Flavor is also of citrus and spice. Medium-bodied and smooth. This is a non-complex but refreshing witbier that I enjoyed. Good summer beer"
"I really like this beer and its very fresh.I wish I had access to more of it.Thanks Bill!"
"Not a white ale I plan on going back to. Average at best."
"Did pair well with a slightly spicy 'curry' style dish."
"D : Really good and enjoyable"
"D = Good drinkability, goes down easily and is pretty refreshing."
"Drinkability: a very refreshing and easy to quaff wit. Definite summertime session beer."
"D: A great session beer, good for summer times. Very easy to drink."
"Personal note: my 900th review"
"Great beer, I had a few."
"D- This brew has grown on me. I enjoy it and it is easy to drink."
"Another winner from Great Lakes. I find this an extra relaxing beer to drink. Maybe because it recalls summer, or maybe because the tea is imparting some good vibes into this. Or could be a placebo effect. Regardless, I like this, and will revisit periodically this summer since the price is right."
"A very drinkable beer. This would be a great beer for the texas summers (if only we could get it here!)."
"D: A nice drinkability due to a nice combination of taste and mouthfeel. A little overcarbonated, but still a decent drinkabilty. Worth a session if you can get it."
"D-Great flavor and aroma, but body's overall light nature off-balances the mix. It is just a bit too light to carry the beer's bright character. Still, a good drink, smooth, and delicious."
"D- this is one of the beers that got me into the craft movement. nice soft flavors make for a great warm weather beer. i've had it in the summer AND in the winter and it's more appreciable when the mercury rises. the drawback, however, is that i drink it too fast to appreciate the flavor!"
"This is a really nice interpretation of the Belgian White Ale style beer. Pours a decent head with crisp carbonation. Smells of corriander, lemon, and wheat. The aftertaste sometimes lingers a bit, in a strange way. This is the only drawback. But it is a clean, smooth, crisp refreshing brew. Tastes of citrusy fruit and spices. Really great summer beer."
"Holy Moses (great name) pours a hazy, light yellow with a faint greenish tint to it. A fluffy white head fades quickly but leaves some nice lace on the glass. The nose is bright and lemony with yeast and banana. The tast is light and lemony with some sour and bitter fighting each other in the aftertaste. The carbonation is high and spritzy with fits this beer well with a medium/light mouthfeel. Not a bad example of the style, but I wasn't inspired to reach for another."
"Like I stated earlier, I was expecting a normal witbier but the darker surprise was awesome. I will definitely be buying these again."
"Uhh ... I wonder if anyone here has ever had chamomile tea? Because if you have, it's what you can expect in this beer beyond the typical characteristics of the style. The beer is interesting, but way, way too much like chamomile tea, like someone dropped a teabag into a run-of-the-mill witbier. Otherwise, this beer is pretty good, but I couldn't get past the (over)interpretiveness. Needs more of a citrus kick, less bitterness."
"A very nice beer. When compared to Hoegaarden this has slightly more body and flavor. I think this is a really excellent interpretation of the style. This will be a great summer session beer."
"D - it is drinkable in the same way that Bud is drinkable. It is smooth and not really there. I would definitely not look for this one again and have to say that overall this is so far my least favorite of all of the GL beers that I have had. Usually this brewery makes me want more and more but here they leave me not wanting another one at all."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin and the carbonation seems to be slightly low for a wit. Dry finish; really dry. Clean, crisp and citrusy. Certainly this is a wonderful session type beer. Perfect for summer, like most wit beers. Not sure if I would totally recommend this as there are plenty out there just as good or better. Overall, slightly above average."
"Overall: I'll admit it's been a while since I've had a Belgian Wit, so perhaps my palate's a bit off. However, the BJCP guidelines seem to confirm my general thoughts: that this beer is too bitter and lacks the sweet citrus notes generally associated with Witbier. I fear that an American Witbier--a neutered, more Pils-like version of a Witbier--is developing just as the boring American Hefeweizen developed here in the States. Holy Moses is a good beer on its own, but it lacks the uniqueness that generally leads me to choose a Wit over a pale lager."
"Pours an oh-so-slightly fogged straw with a decent white head that is leaving some lace on the way down. Nose is citrus and funky. And even though it doesn't show a lot of spice, I think it's what you expect from the style. Flavor has a pretty good body. Decent level of funk mixed with a vibrant citrus edge. The only detracting feature is its lack of staying power. It seems to fade just a bit quicker than it should. Feel is good. Overall though there is a biting edge that detracts from things I have to say. And also it seems to lack a balance that would make it easier to drink. Overall it is a decent interpretation of the style from an American brewery."
"D,notes: In my opinion the best American witbier. Flavorfull, filling but highly drinkable - a perfect take on the style. Well balanced - an excellently consistent thread in Great Lakes Brewing Company beers."
"D - On the whole, not bad. I would drink this under the right circumstances, but it would not be a go to beer."
"D- Light. Would make a nice brew for a hot day. Goes down very easy. Overall, a pleasing Belgian style."
"Overall this was a classic Witbier with a really nice little twist at the end. I am loving all these great lakes brews I have been able to get up here they are really great quality and this one ws no exception. A really quality little ale here I would definitly try again."
"D - Good beer. Nice beer that's easy to drink. There's a lot going on with the flavor but it works well and tastes great."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I found this beer to be very smooth from start to finish with nice citris notes and would definitely recommend it to fans of the style, as it is probably my favorite Witiber to date."
"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle with a ton of information about the beer printed on the label. Very light yellow color with a significant amount of haze. Nice fluffy head that leaves plenty of lace all along the glass. Head is a little darker than pure white, but very close. Smell is of citrus, wheat, and spices. Lemon and orange are most noticeable. Taste is very refreshing. Nice citrus zing with an abundance of spice. Lighter body and ample carbonation. This seems like a perfect beer to be enjoyed during the spring or summer, though I'm digging it in the middle of winter."
"Another excellent find at Pizza Plant, Holy Moses is very smooth, a mellow accompaniment on a sunny, very cold day. The body is cloudy and a very light golden, one of the lighter colored beers I can remember--just a shade darker than Hoegaarden, but isn't everything. Two fingers of white foam top off the pint glass, but the head isn't as durable as one might suspect from first glance. The smell and flavor are a wonderful amalgam of fruit and spice, with banana, grapefruit, and orange co-mingling with ginger, coriander, and a dash of pepper. The carbonation is a little light for me, but the smooth taste make this beer all too easy to drink. Really good find, something I'd like to try on a hot summer day six months from now."
"The head and the flavor fades too quickly in this beer. It really leaves you unsatisfied and wishing the flavor would stick around just a little longer."
"Great beer for spring. I wish I could bring this beer to Boston. It would easily put Harpoon UFO to shame."
"All and all a good beer. The earthy tones in the flavor just didn't thrill me, but otherwise a solid wit."
"Just good, certainly not great."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Nice white head, with very good retention,and lacing. Aroma is spicey,but weak. Body is light,but creamy,with just a bit of carbonation. Taste is of sweet fruit,clove,and spice.On the light side,but smooth,and refreshing. Very good!"
"I only bought one, but could surely go through three or four in a night. 4.5 on the mouthfeel as the spice is lingering nut not stick tounge causing. Good Beer"
"D: A good brew within the style. Reminiscent of Batch 8000. If I have a hankerin' for a wit(which is very and far between), I'll most likely reach for one of these."
"Recommended"
"Drinkability - This is a very likable beer in a very quaffable style. I'll take all I can get. Extra points for an amusing label. (I believe Moses is parting Lake Erie and Cleveland is the ""promised land."")"
"i left the sediment in the bottle when i decanted this. there was an initial chill haze in this straw/golden beer that became clear after several minutes. nose has some sweet bready aromas and hints of spice and resiny orange. taste is a nice balance of light, doughy malt sweetness with a spicy, crisp finish. light in body with a chewy mouthfeel. this is very sessionable."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, pale and wheat malt scent. There is a faint scent of coriander and orange peel, but much less than most wits. The taste is decent. It has a watery wheat malt flavor with some spices and orange peel in the finish. It's much lighter than most. It has a mild citrus element as well as a weak Belgian wit yeast presence. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a really average wit. It's real plain and uninteresting."
"D: Quite good. Sessionable for sure."
"Drinkability: This is a light, summer-time beer. Nothing objectionable.... refreshing and un-filling."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a fluffy white head that sticks around. Served with an orange that has some of the lacing stick to the side on the glass. The smell is almost non existent at first pour. After warming up a bit I was able to notice some spices. Taste is yeasty with some belgian type spices, such as clove. Mouthfeel is smooth but highly carbonated for a nice texture of the light flavors and strong mouthfeel creating a nice balance."
"Probably the best witbier I've had. Good for a beer that's not anywhere near my favorite style."
"One of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability: Awesome. This is the perfect summer quencher. Full of flavor and pleasant finish. I could picture myself working out on a field somewhere being eternally gratefull for a gallon of this stuff to pass the hours. Seek it out and give it a try."
"Drinkability: could do two in a night, but not back to back"
"pours a nice cloudy golden color with a mild head. hardly any aroma to it at all, some citrusy hoppiness to it, but no malt. tastes good, oranges are first noticeable, with a more predominate hop flavor. mouthfeel is average, a bit watery, but it is a pretty good beer all around"
"Pours a clean yellow with a white head. In the nose, it was floral and Czech hop presence. In the taste, sweet and a bit yeasty, and presence of a standard wheat beer. It is a bit dry in the mouth, yet smooth and easy to drink. A decent summer beer, however I still am not that partial to wheat beers in general."
""
"Drinkability: An excellent summer beer, really hit the spot after a 90 degree day."
"Pours a nice light yellow copper straw color, with soem light head and lacing. Nose is citrus, some spices, nothing much else. Taste is solid; refreshing wheat and orange flavors. It's pretty standard for a Witbier, actually, although not bad. Body is a little thin, but good on carbonation. This one was by no means bad, but it was certainly nothing particularly interesting from a brewer that does a lot of things better. I'd stick with the Edmund Fitzgerald or Elliot Ness."
"From the tap, the brew proved to be somewhat of a disapointment Upon the delivery of the beer, I noticed a clearer-than-normal opaquness and fizziness that I had not noticed in the beer before. Aromas are as soft, malty, spicy, and fruity-fresh as I remembered. The flavors, however, seemed off; getting into Lager territory and not the delicate citrus flavors that I expect. Instead a medium, tart apple flavor mixed with cereal grains and pilner malts flavored the brew. The mouthfeel was also off; not the velvety, airy, dry, clean texture I wanted, but a carbonated, 'scrubbed' feel that left a grain flavor in the finish. Not that I was a bad beer, but it was not a good Wit."
"Very drinkable, I burned through the six fast. I don't have this by the case at my store but I will be heading back for another 6er ASAP. I meant to drink the rest of this during ""Entourage"" but looking down at my glass I see it's time for another beer."
"A nice wit to have, esp. on a hot day."
"Light citrus bitterness up front. Mellow honey wheat bread and mildly sweet fruit notes. Some straw flavor too. Becomes yeastier with citrus and spice taking over. Not too spicy though. Finish is long and yeasty with zesty citrus and lingering mild fruitcake notes. Medium-bodied with a creamy, wheat protein feel. Nice, even-tempered carbonation makes for a very refreshing beer. A very nice wit, and will make a fine choice for summer evenings."
"Overall a good example of the style. I'm a big fan of the witbier, and this doesn't disappoint."
"Bottle courtesy of Jdoolin: Poured a whitish/yellow color ale with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coriander and wheat is dominant and refreshing. Taste consists of a good malt presence with a nice dose of wheat, coriander and some orange peel. Refreshing with a full body for the style. Well done and stays within the style."
"Overall, this is a decent Belgian white. It's a good example of the style, but perhaps not my favorite. Like most wheat beers, it's a great thirst-quencher on a hot day."
"Drinkability- I could drink anywhere between one and ten of these and have a good time regardless"
"Always up for a new Witte. Pours a slightly hazy straw gold with a dissappointing 1 "" head. Nothing too impressive, especially for the style. Smell is sweet clover honey and black tea. Not picking up much spice. Taste is a bit shocking. The honey is there, but there is a good bit of bitterness keeping it from becoming too sweet. It's not that the taste is bad, but maybe too strong for such a sessionable style? This competes with the high carbonation making this feel heavier than it probably should. Not what I want when reaching for a witbier. Not a repeat purchase."
"Pours to a light golden color with white head that lingered well and left okay lacing. Okay aroma of spices...mostly corriander, with a hint of clove, though the aroma was definitely underwhelming. Flavor was slightly spicy, slightly doughy, but not strong enough to write home about. Although it had a somewhat tingly mouthfeel, the finish seemed a little stale cardboard-like, and not real long."
"Poured out a light yellow (see: piss) color with a white head that disapeared instantly, no lacing. The nose was dominated by banana and spice. Shockingly, the taste was banana and spice as well. Through this all, you could detect some slightly harsh alcohol. Had a medium body with low carbonation and a slightly creamy finish."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, excellent representation of style, I can see myself drinking quite a few these, yet another very good beer from Great Lakes."
"Pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head. Smell is mostly yeasty and doughy with a hint of orange. The bottle claims that it is spiced with orange peel, coriander, and chamomile. The taste is big upfront with witbier characteristics with a bitter bite that lingers throughout. The citrus comes through towards the end with the bitter bite. This one is a different witbier but still comes through with the usual characteristics. The mouthfeel is medium/light with a decent balance and good carbonation. This one is not the best session beer as far as wits go for me, but it is one that is tasty enough to have a few."
"Creamy and crisp at once, this fills the mouth and then leaves it clean-feeling. This is without a doubt the most drinkable American witbier I've tried to date. I shouldn't have waited so long to come back to this one."
"An easy to drink wit."
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew very much. Well rounded brew in flavor and aroma. Smooth and crisp makes it a good summer ale. Enjoy."
"tastes are the same, with the addition of hints of belgian yeast, coriander, and maybe some other spices. at times it seems to drift into saison territory. nice beer, good for warm weather."
"Not super complex, but it's a good and flavorful wit. Solid 4's."
"D - Overall, nothing spectacular, but still a solid Witbier. I probably won't pick up a sixer, just because I'd rather try a new brew...but still solid."
"Well-balanced, clean, crisp & easy to drink. This makes my anticipation for deck-weather even higher!"
"Cloudy pale yellow with a thin white cap. Soft wheat notes are surrounded by coriander, chamomile florals, yeastiness, and citric grassy notes. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with larger carbonation fizz midway through the swill. Prominent spice level coriander is pretty zesty and even a little hot. Interesting chamomile addition gives it some pungent earthy herbal tea character. Notes of bitter hops, citric lemon, and underlying dryness rounds out the taste nicely. The finish is earthy and dry with notes that are floral, perfumy and a little oily on the palate. Pretty bold characters here, not shy on flavors. The pungent spice and herbal level is very enjoyable but after two of three Id have to switch up."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a best-by date of 7/30/07. Pours a cloudy straw color. Great retention on the white head. Smells very heavily of spices: coriander, orange peel... overall very leafy and savory quality. Same with the tastes... very leafy and herbal. A lot of complex spices. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I think this is quite a good beer. I'm not a huge fan of the Witbier style, but I think this is a fine example of it."
"Had this on tap at the Pizza Plant on Main,poured a hazed lighter straw color with just a thin wispy head that was gone quickly leaving nothing left on top.Quite spiced in the nose big coriander with a touch of phenolic clove the citric element to seemed to take a back seat but it was noticable enough,full mouthfeel for the style this is a pretty sturdy wit beer.Well rounded flavors between the spice and orange-like flavors with that phenolic yeast spiciness coming thru for a long finish.A good take on the style while Iam not a huge fan of the style a wit beer can go down well after a long day at work like yesterday,to me this is a slightly beefed up version of the style."
"The obvious tastes of corriander, white pepper, and orange are predominant. A very pleasent sweetness from the orange peel when it first soaks the tongue. Very filling in the mouth but not chewy. Finishes off with a nice hoppiness and smoothness. This is a very good beer in my opinion, and true contender for blue moon or the likes."
"Drank it before, will drink it again. Good stuff."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a shaker glass. Appears a cloudy pale golden yellow with about half an inch of fluffy white head. Smells of spicy yeast, citrus fruit, coriander. Tastes of peppery wheat, clove, coriander, and a hint of orange. Crisp and medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This is a beer I look forward to having again when the weather gets a little warmer. A nice sessionable wit."
"Frankly, this beer shocked me. It was kind of a random pick at the store, just as something new to try. But it's difficult for me to find fault with it. This beer will certainly keep my penchant for wheat beers going. Holy Moses!"
"Drinkability: Refreshing and very well made"
"Cheers!"
"Really, Really pale, I would say cloudy, but since its so close to being clear, who really knows. Nice yeast aroma, can almost smell the fresh baked bread. The taste was weak, nothing stood out, no citrus, no spice, no nothing. Way better beers out there, that said its really easy to take down a 6 pack of these, and I would rather drink this over macrobrew. Average at best, but easy to drink."
"I can almost transport myself into a deck chair, with my feet in a kiddie pool after mowing the lawn with this beer. (At least I don't have to mow the lawn!)"
"D: The witbier is very easy to drink, soft and spicy, tart and sweet. Well made, I'm gonna save a bottle for the summer and enjoy it in the right season."
"Eric"
"Pours a yellow color with a white creamy head. Smells of yeast, orange and maybe lemon. I am a fan of Witbiers, I would consider this as an average one. It tasted a little too light, the carbonation overwhelmed most of the tastes that go along with this brew, orange peel, bread, yeast, and other spices. Its low ABV and light taste made this brew easily drinkable."
"Got this with the Great Lakes 12 pack sampler, very interesting brew to say the least. I found the flavor to be a bit overbearing, with the orange peel being the dominant flavor with chamomile coming in at the end. Not my preferred style of beer, but I can definitely respect the complexity of this rather thick brew. I recommend it to anyone looking for a uniqe brew that isn't the everyday flavor. A slow drinker of which I'd only want one in a sitting, which is why it got such a poor drinkability rating from me."
"An interesting ""wheat beer"" without being the usual super sweet, super orange ladened beer. Lots of complexities that should keep certain fans happy."
"A very good wit, my only complaint was that it was a touch thick. It was a lovely hazy yellow, smelled of sweet coriander and spice and tasted about the same. I'm not usually a big fan of the slice of fruit thing, but this beer seemed to be asking for one. Go figure."
"Great summer time, happy hour, dinner time... well it's just a good beer. GLBC has done it again, another simply good beer."
"Drinkability- Thirst quenching, I had to take my time with it though."
"Drinkable? hell yeah, and this is by no means my favorite style. And it is flavorable and weighty enough to make you want to keep drinking it. As strong as any witbier you likely to pour into your head. Another great one from GLBC--I think I end all my reviews of their brews this way, but by Zeus' beard, it's true."
"A great Witbier for a sunny day..."
"Overall a supremely drinkable beer. It compares favorably with the Leinie's Sunset Wheat but with a bit more pepper and spice."
"The pour into my Blanch De Chambly glass raises a creamy off white head, sticking around at about one finger. Beneath, the bubbles rise in furious plumes from a hazy gold body. The nose has strong coriander and yeast notes, with a rich bready undertone. The taste is smooth and acidic, and very citric. It's not as wheaty as I would like. There's also a lot of pepper in the aftertaste. It's still nice, but I've had better Wits. The mouthfeel is quite light, and the carbonation feels much finer than it looks. This is a very tasty Wit, and an easy drinker."
"Poured into a nonic,has a nice fluffy white head.hazy looking,a golden straw-like hue.It has a bready,spicey aroma.It has a bisciut,spicey,a sort of a souring taste,citrusy.a lot of different tastes.You do get a hint of the corriander it the taste.It has a light mouthfeel,very carbinated,fizzy.Sort of like a wheat beer.A nice dry finish with a dryness,and taste of yeast and spice at the end,A nice and drinkable beer."
"D-This beer is quite drinkable. It's nicely balanced, refreshing, and goes down easy."
"Overall, I found thid brew to be one dimentional. A would have preferred something more full flavored and a little more complexity. There are better Witbier's out there."
"Pours a nice hazy light golden color. Serves up a finger size head, with moderate retention and pretty nice lacing. Has a nice carbonation to it, which helps out in the appearance and mouthfeel. Smell is mild, with some nice yeast and citrus tones, with a little spice on the side. Taste is nice and light, again with good yeast and citrus flavors. Mouthfeel has nice carbonation, light and crisp. Excellent drinkability, very nice wit."
"Drink a Holy Mo? Can do. Not a style I am crazy about, but this may be my favorite white."
"This isn't an overwhelmingly good white ale but it gets the job done outside in midsummer."
"D: Yet another exemplary brew from GL. A fine example of the style, and a pleasure to drink. Highly recommended."
"Nice drinkable witbier."
"A very nice brew from Great Lakes, glad they switched it from a seaononal to a permanent offering. I'm also lucky to be so close to a great brewery."
"Now all I need is a swimming pool to sit by and drink my Holy Moses. Santa?"
"This is a very drinkable beer and great for the summer time."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours from the bottle a slightly cloudy yellow/orange color. There's a small white carbonated head that disappears pretty quickly. It smells like citrus, bread and coriander. This beer has a lot of flavor, I can taste lemon, orange, wheat, coriander and another spicy flavor, with a small bitter aftertaste which lingers for a little while after taking a drink. It's easy drinking with a light, crisp mouthfeel. Another good beer from Great Lakes. This is definitely something I would drink more of, especially on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: Light body does make it an easy drinker. Nice crisp brew that I wouldn't mind having as a session brew."
"I would definately drink this again, which is good since I have five left. I great example of a Wit. I need to spend more time with Great Lakes brews."
"This isn't exactly my kind of beer but its the best i've had in this style. I don't know, maybe I need to try some more of this style to really appreciate it."
"Drinkability - goes down smooth, but is not as a flavorful as it could be. Would get something else for the next one."
"12 oz. bottle, best before June 28 06. Hazy yellow golden color, with a very thick white fluffy head. Great retention and lacing as the beer disappears. Flowery and zesty citrus aromas. Tart, while showing just a hint of that GLBC bready malt. Flowery and zesty. Pretty easy to drink and refreshing. Good amount of carbonation. Has a good amount of the spices that characterize the style. Overall another good brew from ZGLBC. Not my favorite style, but still enjoyable."
"Cloudy pale yelllow in color. Dulled chamomile, coriander and orange peel in the aroma, with a lack of honey, which I have grown to expect in Belgian white beer. Fresh spicing and floral hop flavors, with a light hint of butter toffee and caramel. A pretty nice white beer overall, though nothing special."
"D: All around it's OK. The only other Wit Bier I've had is Hoegarden and Blue Moon, two very different Belgian style wheats."
"Quite a superior Witbier here. Tasty and full flavored this is a beer that a BA and you mother can like equally well."
"A good full flavored brew. Defiantly a sipper not a quencher."
"A lite colored yelow, with a small white forming after the pour, that disappears quickly. The aroma has strong citrus scents and is accented by several spices. The taste of lite wheat and citrus dominate the flavor, then the twang of the spices ends on the palate. In the mouth, it is lite at the start and gains some weight to its consistancy as it is swallowed. The spices tend to demenish aby hop flavor, the wheat gives it that lite flavor that makes it easy to sit down and have several."
"I could drink this stuff all day long. One of those rare refreshing but not simple brews. It's also one of those ""I can't believe I haven't reviewed that yet"" beers. A staple at our home, my wife and I usually have a few six packs in the cellar, and it's name has been shortened to ""Moses."" It is available all year now, even at my house. Stop on by. It's that kind of a beer."
"Pours a light gold color with bone white head. Beer is clear which goes against the style. Heavy level of carbonation bubbles streaming to the top. Smell of yeast and light malts. Slight citrus orange peel smell. Spices come through in the taste, but the level of spicing is nicely done. Slightly bitter aftertaste but certainly not excessive or bad. Very crisp mouthfeel and finish to this one. A nice example of this style. Gets me in the mood for those warm summer days and a nice light bodied beer."
"Drinkability was good, but I don't think its up to the high standards of the other Great Lakes I have had."
"I may have to pick up a sixer of this again and see if I need to rereview this beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rather light with a plentiful blast of co2. This would make a great summer time brew and I could see a sixer going down quite easily. A nice wit and one I'll look for again in the future."
"Easy drinking creamy, with big initial head. Cloudy orange. Lacey.Banana wheat aroma. Good slightly acidic and herb tea, subtle clove, corriander, ginger, with lemon with orangey aftertaste. Nicely carbonated.Thanks DavidR from Toldeo. Great Lakes has another winner."
"The mouthfeel is pleasant and the drinkability is decent. I do wish I had another one of these so I could experiment a little more. This is an interesting beer if nothing else."
"Drinkability: Was way better than I expected. Will drink it again soon hopefully."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is light to meduim bodied. The taste is very crisp and finishes dry. The beer is a very drinkable brew and I look forward to more."
"A solid witbier. One of the best offerings i've had yet from GLBC. Pours out to a light gold color with a haziness to it, and some notes of sediment lingering in the beer. Medium low level of carbonation, with some notes of lacing. Smell was very nice, yeast, floral hops, sweet citrus. Taste was mildy complex yet remained on the high end of the flavor scale. Light hops and spices blended with mild malt flavor and lemon elements to create an very refreshing experience. Mouthfeel was light, like a liquid beer cloud, if you will. A very good level of drinkability. I will be back to this in the summer months. Recommended."
"drinkability: as expected, easy drinking"
"Pours a bright yellow with a bit of wit haziness and nice fine white head. Smells nice and spicy orange with flowers in the background. A wonderful spice taste. The label says chamomile and I believe it. There's just layers and layers of different spices in there and I can't identify them all. They're playing the clove a bit in this one for effect, and I like it. Really amazing taste. Feels nice and crisp in the mouth. Going down easily, but can get a bit old after two."
"Nice and easy to drink wit. I went back for seconds and thirds on this one."
"Good session beer, but not the best witbier. Could easily drink this with some good cheeses or some fall fruits."
"The lable on the bottle and its name drew me to this beer first. It pours out a golden orange color almost like a cloudy pilsner. Its an easy beer to drink; although I think I would rather have one on a hot summer afternoon, then a dreary November day. It has a floral / citrice aroma and a sweet nose and a bitter hoppy finish, good carbonation. It reminds me of Bell's Oberon. A good choice for some one who might just be getting into ""better beer""."
"The taste is lightly sweet throughout, but is balanced by a spicy astringent note and a bit of acidity / tartness. The orange character is evident in the taste, perhaps even dominant, but it is not quite as evident as it is in the finish. The beer has a full compliment of spicy notes though; with notes of spicy pepper, even a bit of hot alcohol that is reminiscent of ginger and perhaps even a bit of chile-like heat thankfully it is missing that earthy, distracting note that is characteristic of your typical American coriander, which I don't think belongs in beer except in minute notes. This beer has a slightly fuller mouthfeel to it than some Wits, but it is still quite light and refreshing."
"I like the mouthfeel of this beer. The level of carbonation in this beer is moderate and it has a full body. It is not heavy on the palate but is between light and heavy. I like this beer and think that I would definitely buy it again. This beer is easy to drink and I could drink it all night if i were in the mood for it."
"Mouthfeel is decent and the carbonation is not overbearing...a nice interpretation of the style and one more solid offering from Great Lakes."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy yellow with a white head the left a small amount of lacing. aroma floral, citrus, wheat, ripe fruit. flavor, citrus on the (orange side), spicey, ripe fruits, wheat, pepper. not to bad of a beer. not to bad of a beer. glad I bought a six pack."
"Drinkability...nothing special other than the label."
"Although I am not one for a Belgian ale, Great Lakes does a good job here of maintaining the Witbier tradition. Two main characteristics of this beer are immediately apparent. First, the excessive cloudiness of the ale leads one to think that the appearance is not the primary concern here. Indeed the positive qualities of ale are the smell and taste. With a medium head, this ale gives off a rather refreshing sent of orange and has a crisp, citrus taste."
"Murky gold with nice lace. Smell is clean saltwater with some astringency. Lemonny citrus too. Malty taste with some standard Belgian-style floral essences. Wheatty for sure--would make a good liquid for pancake/waffle batter. Somewhat of a prickly mouthfeel up front. Quite cleansing--nice."
"Cheers!"
"Not a bad beer. I'd compare it to the Berghoff Solstice but not worth the couple $ more per six. Very refreshing after an afternoon of painting a house."
"Pours a cloudy hazy yellow with a small white head. Smell is yeasty, sweet, and a little spicy and herbal. Taste is a bit sweet at first becoming tart with some herbal spicyness. Tastes a lot like it smells actually with a little less sweetness. Dry and well carbonated. Quite easy to drink and pleasant overall."
"A drinkable brew, if only to quench your thirst at the very least."
"Pours a pretty golden straw yellow with a multi-finger head and probably the best lacing I've seen. Smell is spicey with hints of citrus and olive oil, like a saison. Taste is fruity, spicey, and refreshing, again with floral, herbal, and olive notes. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but bubbly and crisp. This was a pretty tasty wit. Could use some beefing up, but overall another solid brew from GLBC. Kudos, boys."
"every sip dragged on with some lingering bitterness, and the beer was sweeter than most wits, with a slightly larger mouthfeel"
"It is a very cloudy amber/yellow beer with an slightly off white head. There is also a visual appreance of yeast sediment. The head also sticks around and laces down the glass. There is a strong aroma of floral hops, grass, cleanser, rose, and peanut butter. The taste is a hit of strong floral hops, which over powers the malt. it is also slightly holiday spicy. The mouth feel and drinkabilty of this are sumed up in the same phrase, ""easy and smooth"". Very refreshing beer."
"This was a boring and surprisingly mediocre beer from Great Lakes. It smelled and tasted like overripe fruit and had no standout qualities what-so-ever. As a beer its not too bad but as a Wit one of the worst examples that I have tasted. Im going to stay away from it and hope that Great Lakes will stop making it. Theyre one of my favorite breweries and it saddens me to know that they make a beer this average."
"One more great one from GLBC!"
"D-This beer has a wonderful smell that is very different from the taste. It would be nice if more of the smell qualities were in the taste aswell. Good wit but could use some tuning."
"For starters this beer, like most beers from GLB has a cool name. A beer is always more interesting to me if it has a cool name and story to go with. Shows the brewer thinks about the details. As for the beer I like it. the apperance is that of a good belgian white. I was able to pour a good head without any trouble and I noticed that I missed some of the yeast in the bottle. The smell is nice and even, but to be honest my sense of smell is still in training so I couldn't pick out any details. The taste is smooth but a little crisp, probably from the citrus. The wheat is present but not in the boldest of ways. The beer certainly does go down easy, I had no trouble finishing one and I felt like I could have another."
"(C. Barclay)"
"Well made. Well blended. Nice job. Kudos to the brewers on this nice summer brew."
"Pours pale gold with an orange tint and opaque after the yeast pour. Dense, two-finger head with excellent retention and abundant spotty lacing. Medicinal phenolics in the nose, with a load of coriander and citrus. Wheat and phenol flavor upfront, followed by a zesty blend of mild citrus, herbal chamomile, and faint coriander. The spices are overdone but fade, and the phenols hang on too long in the aftertaste. The carbonation is low, and the body is thin, but it gets some texture from the wheat and yeast making it smooth if not a little too tart. The phenols dry the finish and the wheat/yeast become slightly chalky effecting drinkability- but I would still consider it an above average warm-weather beer."
"Poured hazy and straw-colored, with a little head, but not much. Fine bubbling. The aroma was mostly a wheaty citrus smell. Almost a little buttery, too. The taste was just what I expected from a witbier, with just a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, quite good. I consumed the bottle without a flinch, as it went down very nicely. Overall, a satisfying summer beer (although I think it might be better enjoyed outside, not in my air-conditioned home)."
"A cloudy, dull yellow color, but with a moderate head and good lacing. Smell is primarily of malt and yeast, with some citrus and floral notes. Taste is malty more than anything. There's some lemon and bubblegum flavors, but they're in the background. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. I'm certainly not a connoisseur of witbiers--in fact, I've tried very few--but I get the impression that the fruity and spiced flavors are supposed to take prominence over the maltiness. Still, there's definitely some character here, and it's very easy to drink."
"Pale,hazy yellow color. Nice tight,white head. Slightly phenolic aroma-somewhat citrusy and lemon-like. Malty and spicy flavor. A touch of tartness. Fairly crisp considering the tartness. Good body-holds up well for a decent thirst quencher. A very drinkable beer. I dont know how many I could have in a sitting as this isnt my favorite style but quite nice overall."
"Thanks for this sample Cokes. (But moreso, thanx tenfold for the Louie Growler...)"
"O: Overall a fabulous offering from a fabulous brewery. One of the better american wits available. Definately worth a try-its one of my favortie brews for the summer."
"The beer was a hazy yellow color with a white head that strong clung to the glass. I received an excellent pour, and the beer really had some spectacular lacing. It smelled of citrus with some maltiness. A very good beer with a medium bodied mouthfeel. A lemony/citrus taste that dulls nicely as it passes over the tongue. A great summer beer. This is a great beer to drink on the deck as the sun sets and the crickets start creaking, and the sky out towards that old Lake Eerie starts turning that amber red of late summer."
"hot day beer, but a thirst quencher. Not over the head strong a taste, but that's okay here. Lawnmower beer for sure, just right on a hot day(currently hotter n hades here, with bonus humidity to boot). Honey, floral a bit, lingering soft flavor."
"Pours out a beautifully, light straw, golden with a bright white airy head. The head was not as present as I would expect in this. The small head did, however, leave some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was very fresh and spicy. Cloves, hay, and lemongrass made it a treat for the nose. The body was clear with a small amount of haziness. A spicy and crisp taste hit the tongue with a very clean finish. A wonderful summer beer that could, potentially, be a very nice crossover beer due to its smooth finish. Well done!"
"Very drinkable and jam packed with flavor. Highly recommend."
"Overall- i had been passing this beer up because i didnt want to be dissapointed, but im glad i finally got it. light, but not too light and smooth, even flavor make this a great choice for a hot day."
"A well balanced ale, great for a hot summer day when you don't want to stoop to drinking watered-down macros."
"Drinkability: This is a good style of beer from Great Lakes that would make an excellent summer beer. I think Moses Cleveland would be proud that his name is on this beer."
"Every time I crack one of these open I find myself staring at my empty glass thinking ""Gone already?!"""
"I will be buying this beer again soon."
"This pours a nice pale yellow color with 2 finger head that falls to a moderate coating over the beer. The nose is rich with coriander and creamyness from the wheat. I like it. The flavor is really nice ans well, with a healthy orangey dose of corainder and orangepeel. Very spicey and very refreshing. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. This is a find example of the style. The only thing I have against it is the color. Not quite white enough for me."
"taste benefits from a bit of citric essence, but dwells in the general belgian white world. heavier on the more berry fruit accents. typical of great lakes, this beer is average but a perfect exercise in the style. it was far, far superior on tap at the brewpub."
"Holy Moses this is pretty good! Not the best for the style in my opinion, but an overall good brew. This or the Dortmunder would be my first suggestion for those new to the craft beer scene. Very nice orange cloudy appearance. A bit grassy tasting and the unfiltering is apparent. Could be a session beer, but no more than any other one of the style."
"Ironically, the tapped version is milder than the bottled, but I may have enjoyed it more. Either example is a great representative of American witbiers, and I highly recommend this one."
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy straw yellow body with a one finger white head that retains well. Some sheet lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has a dominant yeastiness, with an assertive lemony citrus profile. Orangepeel, pepper, coriander, and clove add some spicy complexity to the nose. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with some sticky yeast, and medium carbonation. Taste is lemony citrus, with a pervasive yeast presence. Clove and pepper add more spicy bitterness to the lemony citrus and yeast backbone. Dry aftertaste. Very nicely done for an American Witbier. One of the better ones I've tried from North America, and a very nice white ale for summer quaffing."
"Pale goldenrod, with a tightly bubbled white head that rises up thickly and then settles quickly to a fine bumpy cap. Aroma of cinnamon and yeast, a bit of citrus. Flavor is yeasty upfront, followed by some spice, more yeast in the finish, and a lemony lingering taste. A little peppery linger follows after the lemon, followed next by another shot of the yeasty undertone. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but crisp, with a bubbly tingly finish. Well-made for the style, but not too complex."
"Drinkability: On a warm Summer day these would go down one after the other."
"Pale yellow with a large white head. Fruity lemon and orange peel aroma with spices, mainly coriander. Fluffy wheat flavor with fruit. Flowery, spicy flavors. The coriander takes over in the middle, but the finish is dominated by the citrus flavors. Light carbonation. Although big on flavor, the mouthfeel is light. No sign off the alcohol. Great drinkability. Great Lakes has made a very nice version of this Belgian style."
"The mouthfeel is fine with spot on carbonation. The drinkability suffers just a bit from the lack of balance. While not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, I guess I just expected more form this brewery."
"Drinkability: Holy Moses tastes good, but I doubt I would take down another one of these as a follow up. This style is typically not one that I desire a large volume of."
"Another finely crafted Great Lakes beer. Strongly recommended."
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale gold with a hige head that hung out forever and has great lace. Smells of wheat malt , yeast, orange, and a slight hop bouquet. Wheat malt is present but the first and most present flavor is the hop bitterness. The orange citrus flavors are present but not as much as the aroma would suggest. Very refreshing. This is a better than average witbier and is very enjoyable. Another winner from Great Lakes."
"Pours very pale, probably one of the most pale non macros I have seen. A very pale white head is present. Smell is of citrus peel and corriander. Tangy smelling, and crisp smelling if that is possible. Taste is tart, citrusy and of slight corriander. Very light and refreshing. I could quaff this stuff all day. So light and refreshing. This stuff is awesome, and probably my new summer quencher. This is a money wit."
"Cloudy hazy light pale golden color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fresh wheat and mild spice-orange flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, great for the style, very refreshing and tasty, one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: easily drinkable and very refreshing, maybe a bit lacking in overall character"
"Pours a cloudy banana yellow / pale gold color with a crisp white head. Aroma is fruity (especially bananas) with some spice and a little yeastiness to it, as well as citrous notes. The taste is big yet light and creamy. The dominating taste is yeast and wheat, but it is not overdone. On the contrary, the fruity taste is wonderfully balanced by clove, coriander, and orange peel, with a slight dryness. There is even a hint of hops near the finish, helping this witbier to stand out in a crowd. Mouthfeel is light and malty smooth, slightly dry. A slightly bitter (part hops, part lemons) aftertaste leaves you longing for another sip with a pleasant dryness. Although not my favorite GLBC offering, definitely the best tasting and most drinkable witbier I've had yet."
"12 oz. bottle with a best before dating of Jul 12 2005. Pours a hazed pale yellow color with a fluffy white head that dissipates into a thin sheeting of foam. Lightly perfumy in the aroma, my guess is that it is the chamomile. Other typical witbier aromas of unmalted wheat, coriander and orange zest are evident. Lightly sweet, spritzy and a good witbier. The chamomile definitely shows up it the taste with a light tea-like feel. Very flowery. Hop bite is light, but present. A friend brought me back a few beers after touring the brewery and he told me they serve it with an orange wedge in the tasting room. I think it's a mighty fine example of a witbier without it. The addition of chamomile is certainly an interesting twist, as well."
"Highly recommended."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This is everything an American Craft interpretation of this style should be. It is more bitter than most Belgian Wits, but true to the original mission: dry drinkability. I am grateful they didn't design this to be sweet and heavy like so many other New World renditions can be."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy pale amber color. Medium bodied. Nose has a very slight maltiness. Medium carbonation. Layer of yeast at bottom of glass. Starts and finishes sweet, hops stay mainly in the background. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"If this had been my first wit I might have fallen in love with the style. This would be a great beer with chicken or just sitting around with friends. Thanks Jen, I really liked this one and I'll try to find it again."
"This is one brew that really offers a lot. I recommend trying it if you can find it."
"Taste was interesting in some ways, but again ""thin"" and with a grainy mouthfeel. Very lacking when compared to one of my favorites, Oberon from Bell's Brewing in Kalamazoo, MI. I had 3 bottles from the 6 pack and gave the others away. Usually I love Great Lakes Brewing offerings (Edmund Fitzgerald, Elliot Ness) but this one left me unimpressed."
"Final Thought: Doesn't really feel like a GLBC byproduct due to the fact that the taste isn't defined like their others... still a nice showing nonetheless!"
"I must admit, I wasn't blown out of the water after looking at and smelling this beer. From then on though, look out! Holy Moses is, without question, my favorite witbier and is possibly my favorite summer seasonal as well. Great Lakes Brewing Company continues to impress."
"12oz Bottle Aug 20, 2004 Poured aslightly hazy gold color with a fluffy head that laces slightly. Aroma is a mix of yeastiness and spices. Quite peppery. Body is a bit thin. Flavor is thin also, slightly watery, some citrus but not fresh tasting. Overall this needs some work."
"Holy Moses!! Parts the waters to a good beer. It pours a hazy pale yellow with a nice white head thats fair on its lace. The aroma is great for this well balanced, moderatly carbonated wit. Your greeted on the nose by citric spice & the zest of lemon. The taste carries that bold citric zest with a touch of corriander and light wheat. The finish is slight bitter dry, leaving a refreshing mouthfeel. A very drinkable summer wit and another great offering from a Great Lake brewer!"
"Matches admirably against all the best witbiers I've ever had...good job, Great Lakes! Yum!"
"This is a nice summer beer. This is one wit I search out every summer. Tasty and very drinkable beer."
"Pours a pale golden in color with a surface-thin bubbly white head. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and crisp. Aroma consists of coriander, yeast and slight wheat malt. I can almost detect the chamomile in the nose. But it would be pretty discreet, if it wasn't mentioned on the label. So maybe I'm imagining it. Still it gives this wit a unique aroma. Initial taste of wheat malt, lemony citrus, and spice. Yeast and coriander make a strong appearance towards the back. Finish is dry with a some fruitiness to it. This is a decent witbier that serves as a fine summer refresher."
"This is a cloudy yellow with a great white head. The spicing is excellent. The coriander and orange peel brighten up the light wheatiness making for a very refreshing witbier. One of the better American takes on the style. I was highly impressed with this one."
"Wow. Exceptional for the style, wonderfully complex, while retaining all the characteristics of a great wit and maintaining an amazing drinkability. This is an exceptional beer brewed by an awesome brewery. I don't want this beer to end. Simply amazed."
"Taste - this is where I was left dissapointed, it really did not taste like a wit beer, but more like a hefe weiss minus the yeasty spiceness often accompanied with this brew. My first bad beer from Great Lakes. Not the worst, but it is not there best beer by far."
"D&N: Unreal. This is a very well crafted beer by a brewery that (for me, at least) can do no wrong."
"It remains a decent version and I sure wouldn't turn one (or 6) down on a sultry day. No sir."
"Drinkability: I just wasn't excited about this beer. It's not a bad beer, but there are certainly more interesting examples of the style out there."
"A great summer ale. Crisp, refreshing, and clean!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Super easy to drink; perfect for a warm summers day out on the porch."
"A belgian that could be a good session beer. What a concept!"
"Drinkability is decent, think this beer is meant for draught. I believe it really loses its aromatic delight in the bottle."
"Finish is all"
"I am not really a big fan of this style but I really couldn't ask for much better after mowing the lawn. Pours a light yellow color (mildly opaque) with a rather compact white head. Aroma of citrus, spice and vanilla. Light, crisp and refreshing with a nicely spiced and lightly hopped flavor. The finish is vigorously crisp (citrus) and lends to enjoying this Wit longer than I do most others of the style."
"Well, with so many Great Lakes beers I hope to review, I'm running out of shots at Cleveland, but I'll just end by saying this is an excellent summer beer and one that I'd have more of whereever I could find it!"
"This beer pours a cloudy, bright, almost neon yellow color with a small head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was full of citrus with hints of yeast. The taste was very strong and quite spicy. The wheat portion came through strongly, but it was overpowered by the spiciness. I really didn't enjoy this beer much and had a little trouble finishing it."
"Brewed in a Belgian wit style, but didn't quite get there. Aroma was yeasty and faintly floral. Initial flavor was somewhat tart and weissbier-like. Belgian wit spicing was too reserved - there was a faint floral/herbal character, but it was just too far in the background. Certainly not every take on the style has to hit you in the face with spices (i.e. Blue Moon), but they should make more of a statement than in this beer to add some depth."
"I don't know what happened here. So far this is the only Great Lakes brew that I tried and didn't love. I'm sorry but it just wasn't good...at all. Citric acid taste. Sour lemony flavors. There are tons a flowery notes to go along with it. I didn't enjoy this one and could barely finish it."
"First time in the bottle, this is just as good as on tap. The appearance is just as robust and the nose stays as aromatic as from the tap. This beer is fairly loaded with spice and fruit notes and the smell keeps the flowery sense that adds a touch of mystique to this nice GLBC offering."
"Holy Moses: another fine brew from Cleveland. Very hazy, with a nice golden color. Not much head though, although it left a nice cover over the beer. Aroma is somewhat unusual for the style, fairly floral. Light in body, somewhat carbonated, but the taste is a little hard to pin down. More sour than is typical than with most wheat beers, this is much more Belgian than German in style, and is missing the banana yeast notes one would expect, even after I swirled up the yeast on the bottom. Very nice citrus notes, with the orange family dominating, although the sourness is present throughout. Crisp finish. Easy to drink, nice for the summer, and refreshing, although I’ll take a German for my next one."
"Wow, not a big fan of wheat beer but this is a very good beer. A nice gold color with a white head that hangs around for awhile. Nice lace. Smells like a wheat not as strong smelling as some, no over powering smells. Smells clean. Taste great. I pick up a hint of lemon. A very easy beer to drink. The second one is even better than the first. My Bud light friend even thought it went down nice."
"A very enjoyable summer beer. It's crisp, refreshing and leaves me wanting more. Thankfully, I have more!"
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light golden color that is a bit hazy. There are 2 fingers of head with good retention. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a mix of yeast and fruit, very sweet smelling. The taste is a bit of sour lemon, not too tart though, with a light yeasty flavor. It is very refreshing. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and heavy. The drinkability is also very good for this awesome wit."
"This beer poured out a very pale and slightly hazy yellow color. The head was small white and creamy. Sour yeasty tones in the aroma and in the taste. Very light tasting. Not overwhelming at all. Some spiciness with a nice wheat sourness. Not much hop bitterness or presence. Nice and tasty, light and drinkable. A good Wit."
"This is to date the most surprising Belgian styled ale I've had, a wonderful mix of spices to create a unique beer within the class."
"What a good day, when you go down the liquor store a day like today in our country's drinking culture known for piss beer and lime wedged filled clear bottles there is nothing more refreshing than walking by everyone else with a six pack of Great Lakes Holy Moses. At the beginning of the pour a crystal clear gold but this is followed by the swirl of the bottle to get all of the yeast from the bottom in order to place the haze and transform the appearance into a beautiful sunrise on a slightly hazy morning. The massive foaming head glistens as I attempt my first sniff at the aroma. Wonderful hints of clove and the yeasty citrusy zest with coriander and other spices going on. When I sipped on this fine summer day treat I was welcomed with much of the same flavors and the bite of the wheat malt and a hint of vanilla like smoothness. Wow this beer ties it all together so nicely the musty yeast producing such great tones along with all of the spices added this beer deserves so much credit in the world of wits. Mouthfeel light and fluffy but syrupy in the finish just sticks to my taste buds I love it. Wow drinkability, well I'll have another what a great treat for anyday just a well constructed beers and if your aren't into wheats try this one out it may just sway how you feel about them."
"Served with a thick white head that rises above the top of the glass like a giant cloud atop a misty yellow mountain. The aroma is dominated by bananna and clove notes, but there is also a nice yeast component that lends a fresh bread note, like manna from heaven. The taste is light and fruity. Coriander spice, with a creamy bready note as well. Light apple and bananna fruits on the tongue. Decent bitterness on the finish lingers a bit on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is robust and creamy, which when matched to the fine carbonation leads to excellent drinakbility and a tremendous sense of refreshment. After searching for nearly two years for this beer, I can say it is nearly a religious experience. Another world class beer from GLBC."
"Well, this beer is finally back in a bottle for non Ohioians and less traveled Ohioians. It poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a huge foamy white head, no doubt due to the heavy carbonation present. The lace latticed the glass as the white clouds vanished and evaporated. I tickled my senses with an aroma of malt and hops with a delicate hint of spices, but not banging you over the head like some other wits do. Coriander was noticible, but my recovering sinuses dealing with the crazy Ohio spring failed to descern the other ones present. The flavor was of hops and spices with a finish that had a tangy feel to reflecting the spices and carbonation. Another fine Great Lakes beer."
"Had on tap at D's...Luminous golden color with a thin bright white head. Zesty, malty, and delicate spicy aromas fill the nose. Taste is much the same, but malts and lemony-like zesty dominate any spicy elements. Smooth and medium bodied. Drinkability was there...Interesting and not one-sided like other wits can be. This is yet another quality offering from GLBC."
"This is one excellent beer, pours a goldish yellow hue with a white head. Smells of wheat malt, coriander, and yeasty spices. This stuff tastes just as good as it smells. Refreshing spiciness mixed with wheaty maltiness. I'd recommend this to anybody who has a chance to try it."
"Drinkability: One of the best beers I've had in a long time. Quite surprising given my loyalty to the hops. I only with that this was available in bottles to take back to VA with me."
"Overall, a very good Belgian Wit."
