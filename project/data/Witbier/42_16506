Flavor is fairly earthy, with notes of menthol carrying into a wheat backbone and floral, herbal tones. There's a touch of plastic phenol that becomes lightly bubblegum-like. The finish is dry.

Light medium body with a somewhat slick texture. Above average carbonation that imparts a nice effervescence on the finish. Laid back flavor profile that is balanced and has a bit of complexity. It begins with tart lemon over orange, progresses to a bit of spice and ends with a light biscuit cracker. The finish is effervescent and leaves you with a light tart bitterness. A bit more flavor intensity and this would be outstanding.","tillmac62","Jul 01, 2014"

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"After a cheerful pop from the cork this pours a hazy straw colored gold with a bone white head of foam that fell off to a thin skin and cap that never left. Great soapy lace. This beer literally glows in the glass and is so lovely to look at. Nose is bright and funky with Belgian, citrus, and hay. Underneath is a big malt profile with wheat, honey and grain. A touch of spice and orange rind as it warms. Taste is tart with lemon and dry with a hint of hop bitter that stands up gracefully next to a big cracker malt and fresh wheat. Creamy clean, sparkling carbonation, it leaves with a touch of honey and a taste of sour not bitter . Drinks light and amiable. Ommegang has done it again with a classic wit that’s radiant and refreshing.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 3/28/2012. Pours hazy pale straw color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, orange peel, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, orange peel, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruit, citrus, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with wheat; with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice witbier! Great balance and complexity of fruity and spicy esters with wheat; and extremely smooth to drink. This is spot on to style; a very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 18, 2013"

4.02,6.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"classic belgian wit. the pour is cloudy and really pale yellow in color, lots of tiny bubbles rising hotly to the surface. still, the head is small and white, fades pretty quick from the bottle, but ive seen it last better from the tap. the nose is a lot of wheat malt and really farmy funked out yeast, also a fair bit of tartness, like lemon juice from concentrate. the flavor is about the same, with the wheat being really fresh and forward, which is such a rarity these days. the yeast is gold, super bright and spunky, with that lemon zest tart to sourness, almost like a sour beer or wild ale, its pretty far out there on the funk scale. epic carbonation, jivey feel, dances on the tongue, with a real light drinkable body, slammable at this low abv. a really fun beer, could be an easy transition to sours for people yet to get into them, there is so much of that barnyard stuff happening that a sour isnt too distant. overall a wonderful brew, one of ommegangs finest regulars. a treasure.","StonedTrippin","Nov 29, 2012"

Taste is about the same, wheat/yeasty taste, some citrus flavors and the coriander to top it off but a bit watery of a taste Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated yet smooth. Overall this is a solid witbier, and would drink this on occasion. Ommegang puts out a solid product.","stalker5","Oct 08, 2012"

The head settles slowly and maintains and nice thin cap of foam which makes some slick lace on the glass. The aroma brings nice notes of light pale malts, fresh sourdough bread, Belgian yeast, spice and citrus. This moves right into the flavor which brings all of the aromas charater to the tongue.

Lemon hits the nose up front. There's also coriander, black pepper, and wheat malt. The smell is sweet and appealing. Wheat malt and citrus flavors are forward in the taste. There is some of the spiciness in the taste that was detectible in the smell. There are some flavors from the yeast as well. The body is light and there is plenty of carbonation. It's crisp and the finish is not very dry. This is very easy to gulp on a hot day. Overall, this is a solid and drinkable beer.

A bit of yeast character is in there as well but overall everything is too weak. The body of this beer is quite light while the carbonation is moderate.

Taste is kinda bland, I know it's a simple style but the malt seems to overpower this one, basically wheat and malt. Some light lemon and orange with lighter coriander and clove. Mouth was thin and bubbly and easy going, went down like a charm, light hit of carb. I drank my pint real quick, this is a sinch, but the taste is boring and bland, a touch more balance would of did some good. Nothing touches my favorite wit that comes from the best brewery in Maine.","BARFLYB","Aug 18, 2010"
3.43,-8.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Witte is served up a cloudy bright yellow with a frothy looking white head. The head has the superb staying power one would expect in a wheat beer, and leaves lazy globs of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma is very bright and fresh with plenty of lemony citrus and slightly tart wheat. I also detect some coriander and clove in there, but this wit is less spicy than a lot of other examples I have tried. The flavor is lead by the wheat, which has a fairly firm tartness to it. It is very refreshing, with other flavors including coriander and lemon zest. One again, not as spicy as some, and perhaps a bit too much emphasis on the malt, but still tasty. The body is medium with a spritzy and spiky mouthfeel that has plenty of carbonation. I feel like I keep wanting to use the word ""bright"" to describe everything, and I think the lively, yet not overdone, carbonation is one of the main reasons. This is a very drinkable beer that is solidly made. While it is not in the same realm as beers like Allagash White, this is still a quality beverage perfectly suited for the summertime.","zoso1967","Aug 15, 2010"

The palate opens with a wheaty twang and a little tart lemon character. The coriander is definitely noticeable, but in check, working well with the lemon peel. I also get a little pepper. Yeast character is rather low. Drying on the finish, albeit a touch watery, this beer is moderately carbonated. Light in body, this is refreshing and very drinkable.

I felt the carbonation was also spot-on, which added to the refreshing sensation.","alkemy","Jun 19, 2009"

The skunk is not as noticeable in the flavor but the typical Wit flavors are not showing up as anticipated. The body is light but well developed, as is expected for the style. Except for the skunk I would have given this a 5 for drinkability. This beer did not have the level of quality I have come to expect from this brewery or of this style. I am quite fond of both the brewery & style so I believe this is a sub-par bottle.

There's a lot of fizz, which is nice on a warm day, but there's very little to note in the taste: a bit of orange and some nice bitterness, but overall it tasted like citrus seltzer water.

Not much of a hit on the corriander, which is typically found in the witbiers. Some noticable champagne characteristics as well.

4.03,7.2,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Could I drink this beer all day? Abso-frikin-lutely. An absolutely delicious witbier, it's more toned down than Hoeegarden and Allagash Wit, yet is flavorful enough to keep your mind constantly engaged on the fact that you're not drinking just another run of the mill beer. It's a little too smooth; in the summer, especially when it's hot it's possible to see this beer lacking the crispiness to be refreshing. That hurts the drinkability in the long run, because after awhile the fruit/sweet/lushness of the beer could get boring, or at least something that could prove to be a problem. I don't think this is a beer you could sit on the beach all day and drink- it IS a beer that I would kick back with at the end of the day, but this is not a beer that could be drank all day. But, if it's below summer temps, than this is a beer that you can pound two or three 750's of and feel very good about. But all and all, for a wit, a style that does not leave a lot of room to do a lot with (have a Hoeegarden and an Allagash Wit in the same, unmarked glass and try to tell the difference between them), it's a good effort and a solid benchmark in the Ommegang lineup. If Ommegang were the late 90's Bulls, this would be the Ron Harper. It'll never be their best offering, and you would never pick it over MJ or Scotty Pippen (Abbey Ale and Three Philosophers respectively) but it is a beer that can hold it's own, play solid defense and maybe drain a mid-range jumper or two. End crappy sports analogy. Solid offering none the less.","bigeyedfish","Jan 10, 2008"

Weak nose, some faint wheat, and traces of spice or Belgian yeast notes. Smack of pale malt sweetness upfront, followed by sharp Pils malt and rich flaked wheat. Earthy yeast and some very subtle and indiscriminate spice help dry the aftertaste with some snappy and tart phenols. This pairs nicely with a mild noble hop flavor and bitterness that is slightly floral and somewhat spicy but provides and excellent balancing background. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing if nothing else; highly carbonated and light in body but retaining some silky texture from the wheat and susended yeast. Finish is mild and beckons another glass, but a bit dry as the bland spice flavor becomes more pronounced.

The mouthfeel is oh so creamy with a wonderful carbonation. It is probably the smoothest beer I've ever had. However, the complexity is certainly lacking. The spices are kept well in check which is nice, but I'm missing a lot of esters in the flavor, no banana or clove. I imagine it is due to yeast strain and/or ferm. temp.

The nose has notes of lemon juice and vanilla-coconut with just a hint of the usual spices, and some warm spice notes that aren't usually found in a witbier (unfortunately, I'm not enough of a spice scholar to ID them individually). On the palate, the coconut really comes out toward the front, but the finish is all lemon/bready malts. The middle is a bit muddled and shapeless, which detracts quite a bit from the overall experience.

Flavor is solid, with a nice presence of bready malts in contrast to the wheat. Lots of citrusy sweet in the middle with subdued coriander and yeast. Finishes dry, a bit herbal, and tart. Body is light, with a little extra body given by the yeast and a good deal of carbonation. This one offers up a good deal of flavor and a refreshing tartness that keeps me drinking.

Moderate carbonation in a medium but fluffy body, with an easy going mellow wheat and sweet citrus, a bit of lemon zest, and the prevoously-detected spice seemingly subdued by the more dominant flavors. The distinct Ommegang yeast is in there, too. Goes down smooth, a little tart, with a nice dry pull in the back.

The beer poured a light golden color, a bit cloudy and with a nice thick white head. The carbonation is very active in this beer. The aroma is of lemons and corriander. The taste is very refreshing.

A two inch white head forms comprised of very loose bubbles. The aroma is fairly strong, but not terribly complex. Tangy wheat-like witha bit of orange peel in the background. Thankfully, the taste is more interesting than the aroma. It begins with a slight orangey sweetness. This quickly gives way to a wheaty tang and a belgian spiciness that twirl around each other. Add some coriander at the end for good measure. There is a bitterness from the orange peel that sits on the back of your tongue after the swallow. This is an immensely drinkable beer, which is very quenching. I enjoyed it very much, but feel it could be even better with a little more orange sweetness and a little less wheaty tang.

2.92,-22.3,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Lightly hazy, Im alarmed at the clarity and the lack of color. Faint gold in hue, no depth. The head was about a finger in height. White in color, bubbly and then fizzy. Head retention was so-so; it faded to a thin, fizzy cap. A few moments later nothing was left. I am not impressed with the appearance of this beer. Hell, it looks no better than New Belgiums Sunshine Wheat! There was no subsequent lacing either. Dull. The nose lacked potency; I could hardly smell anything. What the hell? Faint notes of citrus, spiced wheat malt, mild dough kisses, flour, some pepper too. The detectable aromas are pleasant and generally Wit-like. Too clean for me, Im not impressed with the nose. Soft. Middling. Inviting by default barely. The palate is surprisingly tart for a Wit. Its not right. I like my Wits with a healthy wheaty-yeasty/chalky flavor in the middle; this one has nothing like that. Nothing. The wheat offers hardly anything. Ive tasted more wheat in adjunct lagers! The spices are hardly noticed as well. Again, what the hell? Pepper is stronger in taste then the coriander. Tart lemon is stronger in taste then the orange peel. This beer is way out of whack. Juicy finish, it is too wet. No dryness. No spice in the aftertaste. I am not impressed at all with this Wit. It is hard for me to believe that Ommegang brewed this. Medium-light in body, slick mouthfeel because the body is thin (and a bit watery) and the carbonation is lacking. More effervesces is needed. Tacky. Sure it is drinkable but it is completely pointless. This is one of the worst Wits Ive ever tasted. It is inoffensive but horribly boring! I have no reason to drink this overly tart, under-spiced, non-wheaty, clean, White Ale again. This is a very sad example of the style. A major dud not recommended. I purchased a 750ml in Milwaukee, WI for $4.00.","bditty187","Jan 03, 2005"

The aroma reminds me of freshly cut hay, fields of clover, coriander, lemon zest, and grains of paradise. The taste is light and refreshing with notes of orange zest up front followed by a solid though not overwhelming finish of coriander. Along with the orange and coriander there are notes of lemon zest, ginger, pepper, banana, and clove. With my second glass I poured the rest of the beer, yeast and all into my glass. It becomes, obviously, a bit more yeasty, with notes of fresh bread, and it becomes quite a bit more hearty.

A very dry beer consisting of dried orange peel and dried herbs and spices in the flavor. Appropriate, I suppose. Some wits, especially some of the Belgians, seem to have a little more body, a certain hefe-like, protein-shake creaminess that really makes them sing, but this is a little thinner.

High level of carbonation overshadows the flavors. Little bits of wheat flavor, mixed with spices are all that I can get. Finishes very dry and unflavorful, with a champagne-like quality to it.

4.13,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Sweetish wheat malt smell with a pungent corriander wiff to it.. Straw yellow pale look in the goblet with a 1 inch thick persistant white head. Nice lacing and retention. Rich malt taste upfront with layers of marshmello and lemon. Smooth thickish mouth with lots of silk on the tongue. After the swallow the brew dries slightly with traces of corriander, lemon peel, and nutmeg on the dry tongue. Quite quenching and drinkable. Very nice summer selection.","frank4sail","Jul 27, 2004"
4.3,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A well made example of the style. Poured a hazy golden peach. Soft, slightly sweet citrus fruit aroma. Very fresh tasting, initially orange peel and coriander spicing were most prominent, but as I got into the beer, the spicing took on more of a clove aspect (yeast?), and that continued to dominate the spice profile throughout. The level of sweetness was just about perfect, enough to compliment the spices, but not so much as to be tiring. Ommegang's products continue to be some of the most reasonably priced I've seen, good value for the money.","Brent","Jul 22, 2004"
3.98,5.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A cloudy pale yellow brew with a bright white head that disappears quickly. A yeasty citrussy aroma with a hint of clove. Citrus at the start of the taste with a wheat and corriander middle and a clean fresh citrus on the finish. An excellent hot weather summer beer. That is flavorful but light on the palate making for easy drinkability ( more than one or two or three ).","ybnorml","Jul 20, 2004"
3.41,-9.3,4,3,3,3.5,4.5,"Turbid dark straw hue. Fluffy porcelain white head yields frothy lace. Soft notes of soured orange, grainy must and herbal phenols in aroma. Wafts of trace banana and honey as the beer warms. Tame and functional in aroma. Begins thinly, with a carbonic acid bite combined with a suggestion of underripe banana perceived initially in flavor. Becomes citric promptly, with orange peel combining with a tart lactic undertone to lend a fermented lemon juice impression. Thickens somewhat mid palate, with lightly viscous oat glucans and suspended yeast adding girth that belies the high attenuation. Becomes progressive more grainy as it breathes. Notes of Sourdough and lemon bar arise concomitantly with mellow coriander after a deliberation. Finishes mostly clean, but lightly spicy with fleeting hints of lemon pepper and must. A solid Wit, albeit shy in yeast esters and spicing. Definitely mellow. My personal preference is for a more vibrant citric presence. Regardless, it's a well crafted brew that exhibits excellent drinkability.","marc77","Jul 18, 2004"

Then this morning a box of goodies arrives from Sir McCall. This was a part of the beery package, and it was immediately fridged and super-cooled using liquid Nitrogen such was my impatience to try it. As the Sun warmed up the Apartment this one really hit the spot. As of this week, it is now available on the West Coast and costs $5.99 for a 750ml bottle - a serious bargain in my opinion. Thanks and Cheers to Sir McCall for this afternoons sample, Im going to get more of this one for sure! Excellent!!","TheLongBeachBum","Jul 03, 2004"
3.87,2.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It pours a cloudy gold with plenty of effervesence, with a nice half finger of head. It has a strong spicy smell over a base of malt. One of the best smelling beers I've ever encountered. The beer has a strong malt and spice taste with none of the fruitiness you normally get in a Witbier. The beer has a light oily feel to it that goes down easily, but has a sharp sour finish. Not a beer that I would avoid, but I'm sure I wouldn't select it over other whites on the market.","claytri","Jul 02, 2004"

The smell is fruity and spicy, with all the classic orange and coriander you would expect from a witbier. The taste is a great blend of wheat malt, citrus, and spices. A nice peppery finish and very refreshing. The mouthfeel very thick and heavy for a witbier. The drinkability is superb as well. One of the best witbiers Ive ever had.

The aroma is mild with an overall sensation of wheat and some hints of citrus and cloves. I was disapointed in the taste. It is considerably milder or less flavorful than many other Wits. There is a taste of the predominant wheat with a small citrus belly, but there is no spiciness that you find in other Wits. There appears to be less bitterness than I would have expected also. The beer is light in the mouth with a crisp cleaness. It's not a bad beer but not memorable either.","rdrummer","Jun 22, 2004"

Aroma was of wheat, yeast and citrus with spice notes of coriander. Spices were much more pronounced in the flavor. Tasted of oranges and yeast, and almost a ginger-like spiciness. Finish is far from dry, bitter hops coat the throat in a lip-smacking, thrist-quenching kinda way. I thought this was a great example of the style, and was top-notch quality. I will definetely be buying this all summer as it is perfect for the season (year round for that matter) and is my favorite Ommegang so far.","nixhecks","Jun 15, 2004"

4.05,7.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Hazy pale yellow in color with a nice thick 2"" head. Very light lacing does develop. The aroma is of spice and wheat. The flavor is different from some others in this style as the wheat, citrus, and coriander tones are more laid back but are nicely balanced. A light tartness kicks in up front and it is very dry on the finish. This is lighter in body and had nice carbonation levels that give it a light crispness in the start of the mouthfeel.

3.77,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Appearance is a very light murky yellow, rivaling the color of many macro-swill out there, but at least i know there will be flavor behind this to back up that color. Head is decent, white and soapy, leaving little to no lace. Smell has lots of wheat and banana, with some fig hints and no hops to be had. The taste is very very light, and rivaling on tart, but is a bit hard to pick out. There are some grassy wheats definatley and some malt, with some more of the starchy fruitiness. The mouthfeel is very thin yet very carbonated, with larger bubbles, much like soda water. This is my first witte beer, and I think it was a good one to start on.","FranklinPCombs","Jun 02, 2004"

Seems like more people were struck by the lemon taste but I found an orange taste more prevailing. What was really great about this beer was the mouthfeel. This wit is very well carbonated and feels good on the tongue. It was a bit dry, however, and I think could be more refreshing.

I was expecting it to be a little more dull, but that's fine by me. Smell was refreshing as well. Citrus aromas blended in with some spice and yeast. Taste is a little on the light side, but yet flavorful which is great for the summer months. Orange and lemon hit the palate with some wheat and grain flavors which blend in so nicely. Carbonation is really good in this brew. A nice amount in there. I must say, one the of top 3 wits out there. A very nice brew.","necoadam","May 30, 2004"

The taste is light and flavorful at the same time, as the spicing of this brew is very good. The spices hit up front with the wheaty opening of this brew, the middle is a bit hoppy and citrus-like, and the finish is lightly bready, crisp, and clean. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, and the drinkability is good as well. This is a damn good American witte, perhaps even better than Hoegaarden.","francisweizen","May 17, 2004"

It comes off as being dry and a bit weak and watery. There is the clove flavor, but the fruitiness is quickly lost as you swallow. The wheat flavor fine. It seems a bit bland and stale.

At this amount, I was expecting something out of this world, or at least something better than average. In turn I got something very average. Next time I will stick to my Allagash White.
