"O: A very enjoyable experience, and the first Boulevard offering I've liked out of what I've tried. Had I been able to find a case of this, it would have come home with me."
""
"The beer has a great look, is is a little hazy, kinda orange, with a decent head and carbonation.  The smell jumps out at you, very spicy, I liked it very much and was very intrigued.  The taste followed the smell.  But the orange takes the lead instead of the spice, you really pick up the citrus, mostly orange.  There is some spice but it is perfectly subdued and also just a touch of sour.  After noticing the sour I then began to notice it in the smell.  The beer is very smooth and clean, extremely easy to drink and there is no notice of the 8% ABV.  Overall I was shocked how much I like this beer.  I will have to get another one of these."
""
"Too many spices in this one.  Could have been better."

"Beer was ok. Not great"
""
""

"Great beer for the style. A cross between a saison and a wit. The beer leaves you wanting more and a slight sour feel at the back of your mouth as the beer goes down. This is a great beer with a slight crazy side. The brew masters were brilliant when they came up with this recipe."

"Overall - An unique take on the style and thoroughly enjoyable throughout. The balance is a bit off with the citrus not making way for some of the spice characteristics, but if you enjoy saisons or sours this may be one that you'd want to seek out. I would drink it again, but one glass in a sitting is all that would retain my interest."

"Mouthfeel is fairly rich and the alcohol is well masked.  Not a bad beer but not quite the ""Witbier on steroids"" that I was expecting."

"Overall: A pretty good twist on a Belgian style Wheat Beer. Good mix of spices that are big but don’t overwhelm the fruit flavors. A nicely unique and tasty Wit."
""
""
""
""
"TOTAL - 40/50"
""
"Balance is met with some tropical fruit like sweetness as well and finishes with a slightly sour kick."
"Overall:  Awesome double wit.  Love the twist between old and new.  It works for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Strongly sour with a hint of honey and coriander"
""
""
"Overall - This is a very good beer. Not having much experience with this style, I did not know what to expect and had to actually read about the style before I wrote the review. I am quite impressed with this offering from Boulevard's Smokestack Series. Condor recommended, Condor approved."
""
""
""
"Great tasting beer, especially for the style. A craft-beer-lover's Blue Moon: sweet, wheaty, and easy-to-drink. There's a lot going on in this glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – A lot more sour than I expected from a witbier. Feel like it is a bit of a hybrid of styles.  Tastes great and refreshing but the sweetness became a little overwhelming.  In the second tier of Boulevard’s Belgian-style beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
"I don't know what they're talking about: all I can see is a glass with some interesting atmospheric decorations.  Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy brass-gold topped by a finger of white foam.  The nose comprises lemon zest, light Sunny D, clove, a touch of black pepper, and a hint of cracked wheat.  The taste brings in more of the same, a healthy amount of slightly tart lemon/clementine and orange guiding the spicy wheat ship to glory in the Napoleonic Wars.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a damn tasty wit, sorry, ""Double Wit"".  I need more of this..."
""
"Overall: I really like the idea aimed for with this beer, I just think the coriander is a little too strong. it dominates the flavor and lingers behind after a sip. if it were a bit more refreshing and with less coriander this would be a great beer."
""
""
""
"As a wit it's a bit tart; as a sour, it's a bit weak; as a combination, it seems just a bit confused.  That said, there's really nothing wrong, but it didn't really work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Two Jokers pours a hazy golden color with a very small head.  There is a very big bold aroma, lots of sweet Belgian candy notes, hints of orange.  The taste has big notes of orange, various spices, Belgian candies, and finishes with first a tartness, then a creamy wheat flavor.  A little flat, but big flavors.  Overall its very flavorful, nice fruit flavors, not overly sweet.  Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very refreshing."
""
""
""

""

""

"O- Very unique flavors going on here. They've pretty much pinpointed the ideal construct of an imperial witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the more interesting takes on a witbier that I have had in a while. I get a lot of lavender in this beer and it is a taste I really enjoy. For me, this will be one of my go to witbiers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really neat beast... pours golden with sticky lacing. Loads of spice in the nose and in the taste, coriander and zest heaped upon a thin wheat backbone. Then there's the lacto-funk, which really makes this brew interesting. I just reviewed NoDa's Gose... it could've used some of this complexity. Neat brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall a very nice and refreshing wit beer. Would get some more."
""
"What an interesting take on a heavily spiced witbier, they really showed off on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy yellow pour with a one-finger white head. Very nice citrus, lemon and yeast aroma. Excellent lemony tart flavor upfront with a nice tropical fruit edge. Light body has a strong spice presence with flavors of coriander and clove standing out. Also, has very light hints of grain and yeast. Finishes tart, juicy and refreshing."
"Simply awesome. This ranks up there with Tank 7 as my favorite beer from my favorite brewery from Missouri. If you see it, grab it, and you'll be blown away!"

"nothing quite like this one on the market, a jazzed up wit with all kinds of fragrant character and depth. blonde and hazy, looks the part, bubbles are huge and plentiful, nice for hot weather. the nose is where it gets interesting. cardamom is there, and the lavender they claim is right up front, short of perfumy, but getting there. the spices seem to clash a little with the classic orange and coriander. while congruent in the nose, they seem disjointed and at odds in the taste, especially the finish, where the blooming lavender is too much. i super dig the tartness to this though, the yeast is so much more than the average wit style yeast, there is a funk here, almost saison-esque as it wraps up. wheat malt base is much larger than most, but it never gets heavy and it never gets sweet. in fact, the feel is fantastic. lively carbonation and a smoothness to it. refreshing save the high alcohol content, which is more distracting than helpful in this particular beer, but the smokestack series continues to be incredible and distinct. one of my favorite lines in commercial american brewing. worth a try for its originality."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer may be better than I remember it, but my palate has come a long way since I first had it many years ago. This was one of the earliest examples of Boulevard's new Smokestack Series offerings I ever had, and having it was a gateway into Boulevard coming into its own when it comes to Belgian styles. The reprise of this fan favorite is a welcome addition to (hopefully) their regular lineup."
""
""
"It reminds me of a hyper-evolved version of Cisco's wonderful Grey Lady--a super spicy, lightly sweet wit that tastes like a combination of wonderful potpourri and a handful of strange, Victorian-era candies."
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad it's back! Surprised that I enjoyed it so much back before I'd had much beer experience; this has a distinguishable bitterness. The fruit notes are much more obvious, as well as an inoffensive grain note. The tartness is another good step away from faceless witbiers. All in all, everything could mesh together a little better, but still a wonderful beer."
" Good Beer. I was taken back by how citrusy the beer tasted but as I drank became very accustomed to the taste. Very light. Would be a great summer beer."

"Overall a very interesting brew. I’ve never encountered a beer that accomplishes what this does, giving off an aroma that isn’t anywhere close to the actual taste. Beautiful."
"O-Yeah the bottle was older as it has been discontinued. Fresh maybe it will be better. Drink it now if you have any lying."

"Body is medium to medium-heavy, with mid-level carbonation. The beer foams up across the palate, resulting in a generally smooth mouthfeel. Still, the ethanol presence is easily felt, giving a subtle burning sensation across the tongue and into the nostrils. Finish is semi-dry."
""

"Pours out a hazy darker golden-orange color with a tall frothy head with several minute's of stability and decent quality lacing. Smells and tastes exactly like a 40-60 ratio hybrid between a Berliner Weiss and a higher-gravity Belgian Wit. (Tart lemony lactic pucker with florals, phenolics, and a touch of horseblanket funk combined with spiced citrus peel / citrus juice and garnished by white pepper.) Balanced exceptionally well in the precise middle point between dryness and sweetness. My only criticism is that the body came across as somewhat too far on the heavy side of medium thickness for my preferences, despite the valiant efforts of the carbonation, it got a bit sludgy and left a thin sort of residue / coating film on the inside surface of my mouth. But I can deal with it because the lingering film has a flavor that I actually enjoy. I just... wish it didn't cling so much."

"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber with nice carbonation. Thick white head leaves lots of lacing. Somewhat sour, citrus and light fruit start. Coriander, citrus and light hop finish with a hint of wild yeast. Nicely made, but a bit too sour and coriander forward for me."
""
"Poured into a shaker from the bottle. Pours a hazy burnt orange with globs of yeast that settles to the bottom. Big frothy head, minimal lacing. The nose is slightly phenolic, but lots of sweet citrus, banana, and robust wheat. The taste is huge banana and clove, very sweet and very tart. The tart does help balance out the sweet fruit flavors so they are not cloying. The mouthfeel is creamy with the tart dominating the finish. Overall a good wheat beer. I think the tartness was unexpected, but really helped balance the beer."
""
""
""
"O - Excellent wit, lots going on."
"Overall: This beer grew on me as I drank it. The spice was quite nice and the malt backed it up perfectly. I would have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this is a really solid beer. It's smooth and creamy to start, but finishes tart and dry. I like it. I don't think I could drink this on the regular, but if I were in the mood for it, I'd seek it out. Another impressive offering from Boulevard."
""
""
""
"D ~ Really great wit. So much attention to detail. Not much else to say, the Smokestack series has not disappointed me yet. Their Belgians especially!"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a perfect witbier for winter. A bit on the heavy side for the style, light but noticeable spicing, and a very pleasant tartness. I'd love to have this again."
""
""
"The first chance I get I'm heading back to where I bought this and cleaning their stock of 2 jokers out."

"750 ml bottle into tulip, bottled 1-2011; best by 12-2011. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big banana, pepper, clove, herbs, ginger, wheat, citrus, bubblegum, light bread, and yeast spices. Some very nice and highly complex aromas, with great balance. Taste of big banana, bubblegum, pepper, clove, apple, citrus peel, light herbs, bread, grainy tartness, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of banana, bubblegum, tart grain, bread, spices, and citrus on the finish for a bit. Medium body and elevated carbonation; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel, with some light prickly carbonation. Extremely smooth to drink; with pretty much no alcohol noticed at all for 8%. Overall this is an excellent imperial Witbier. Great balance of flavors; big complexity; and very smooth to drink for the level of alcohol. Really enjoyed this one."

"O: 1st witbier and will not be my last. Very impressed with this brew and will enjoy more in the future."
"O: The price was right, and so was the taste. Great stuff!"
""
"Tried the Two Jokers at a beer tasting last night. I think this beer should be called a ginger beer…it has a huge ginger ale taste and smell with punch of lemon/lime big carbonation white foamy head not much lace. The beer is cloudy/hazed straw yellow color with massive carbonation. The high ABV is well hidden. The mouthfeelis medium to big body. Overall I would say this is a sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not a bad beer, just something I haven't quite developed a taste for. Too many competing flavors and sensations. I guess you could say it's complex."

"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style."
"O: A very good witbier. I personally do not prefer the tartness of the citrus in the taste, but many likely will. Still a very nice wit that I will enjoy next summer!"
"O: Quite tasty, and surprisingly high in abv, but showed no sign of it at all. Nice beer, except it seemed a bit low in terms of carbonation, which is a bit odd for the smokestack series."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a cloudy, golden yellow color. There was a huge white frothy head on it. the head lingers awhile and leaves some lacing. Decent aroma to it. Wheat, citrus and some coriander and other spices. The taste is very good. Good wheat body. Definitely more than a typical wit. Wheat, lemon and other citrus dominate the taste. Some spices, other fruits (banana, other tropical?) in there also. Nice. Another keeper from the Smokestack series."
"Notes: Not a typical Witbier, more like a mix between a Wit and a Tripel. Overall it was pretty tasty with a nice amount of fruitiness but nothing overly sweet. Enjoyable beer, especially for a warm day."
"Hazy golden-orange. Zero lacing from a foamy white head that disappeared quickly. Smell was tart, along with some fruity white grapes. Somebody else mentioned Sprite in their review, that's certainly near the taste, something like a fruity punch spiked with Sprite. The mouthfeel is bright, crisp, highly carbonated. Quite frankly I wish this was 750 mL of Sprite. I could use a Sprite right now to cleanse my palate."
"Now I'm done. Drink it for a pleasant evening when the beer shouldn't be the main attraction."
"Overall, I'm not very impressed with this beer, a rare naysay for this one."
"Overall - A strong showing of an American style wit. While it may lack some of the yeast character of a traditional wit, it’s such a full, rounded flavor. The defining characteristics - citrus zest, hint of clove, and so on - can be used to describe so many beers in and out of this style, but this one’s worth spending some time with to explore all the nuances. As an added plus, the bottle (in my experience) really is just as good as finding it on tap."
"One a warm summer day, this is a easy drinking beer that could be consumed in large quantities."
"Overall Impression- Perfectly refreshing, has nice body and punch to it and nice fruit flavors added. I've enjoyed this now on-tap and bottle. Both were phenomenal and don't remember much difference between these two. Get your hands on if you can!"
"The acidic tartness was a nice touch and unexpected. A great summertime beer."
"The taste is initially a yogurty lactic beauty. Creamy and tart, it definitely delivers the goods on that end and blends perfectly with the mouthfeel. As the beer warms, the spices come to the forefront, but they are much more muted than the nose. I'd probably prefer a bit less of a potpourri and a stronger traditional Belgian White spice blend to come forth, but this does it's job of expanding my mind of what a beer can be. Can you really ask for more than that?"
"Drinkability is okay, it's a lighter, dry brew, and the high ABV is well hidden, but way to spicy for my taste. I love classic wit biers, these home-brew kitchen sink style ones, much less so..."
"Enjoy!"
"Boulevard's simple-sounding tweak to Two Jokers -- making the beer 25% sour -- has resulted in a nearly flawless beer. This is the shining example of the imperial witbier in the world. You MUST drink this beer."
"Everything about this brew screams 'extreme' & it comes close to delivering. Hits its high point in the nose, spicing is over-the-top but tasty nonetheless. Another good beer from Boulevard."
"O - A fine example of a wit-beer with a wild, spicy, fruity flavor. Well done!"
"Overall, excellent summer beer."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with two fingers of white foamy head that retains well and laces a ton. The atoms is citrusy and spicy. The flavor starts with a spiciness and then becomes tart with sweet citrus. The mouthfeel is nice clean an balanced. Overall a great wit beer."
"Nice and smooth. Not as prickly as I would have thought. Refreshing to the palate, even though it's hot as balls outside."
"Wowie wow wow! The Continental would approve. Colored like freshly squeezed tangerine juice, and it has a thin off-white small bubbly head. It smells like canned peaches and rosemary. Tastes like malty wine with a dry finish. It has lotsa stone fruit flavors and the rosemary nose is on the tongue. Some classic Wit attributes of course, but something all its own. Fantastic and I'm getting another."
"O – Has to be the best Witber I have ever had, maybe because of the addition of the funk yeast that adds the extra level. The 25/75 is perfect, anything more and it would be a little too much!"
"O: Not sure if I'd necessarily call this a Witbier, but it was good."
"Overall I really think this is a pretty good beer especially for the the summer, very refreshing! I really like the changes they made from last years version, the added sourness although subtle, its great!!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium. A pretty light body overall though. No doubt helped by the huge amount of carbonation. Very refreshing & a unique beer. A fantastic summer beer & very drinkable! Prosit!!"
"loved this double wit and would highly recommend to seek out and sample. yum!"
"Great beer, one of the best yet from the Smokestack series."
"D: Very very nice big witbier. Boulevard continues to impress and surprise with this smokestack series, and this lavender and spice is no exception."
"O: With a high ABV that is well hidden, I would drink this more often if it was available locally, and more often still if it was in a smaller format, which takes it down a bit in the overall score for me."
"Note - I initially gave this beer a 2.95, but after drinking about half of the bottle, the flavor and mouthfeel got a good bit easier to take, but the beer still didn't do much to become a drinker."
"D: To kick off either the spring or the fall, few things would be better. Encapsulates the best of a belgian wit, while retaining a fair bit of the fruity, zestiness of their flagship unfiltered wheat. Well done again, BLVD."
"This was subtly done and nice. I love the smokestack series."
"Drink- Most Witbiers are small and lack flavor. Not this one. Flavor came in waves and was a nice tasting brew. Thanks to my man Dale for the trade."
"D - Extremely drinkable and enjoyable brew. The beer is very refreshing and flavorful and has a nice strong and delicious spice character. The ABV is high but not too crazy."
"D- This is a very good brew overall. ABV is well hidden. This reminds me more of a saison than an imperial witbier (which is interesting since there are several saisons in the smokestack series)- but it definatelt falls into the pale Belgian category well. Another great brew by Boulevard."
"D: pretty good for an 8% beer, goes down without tasting like it, but I am feeling it near the bottom of the bottle. However, the overpowering herbal taste makes me wish I had someone to split the bottle with. I"
"drinkability was ok - i enjoyed this high spiced beer so close to the holiday - decent sipper on cold winter night"
"An amped up wit with a hefty dose of additional spices, this is certainly one of the more interesting versions of the style I've had. It's bigger than most though and the burn actually limits the drinkability."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy dirty beige color ale with a huge white foamy head with super good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of cardamom and coriander is incredibly well balance with some dry wheat malt notes and light fruity ester. Taste is also dominated by loads of fruity ester with well balanced spicing with clear notes cardamom and coriander. Wheat malt is solid without being too sweet which is often the case with double wit. Another beautiful beer form Boulevard which keep surprising me with the quality of their offering."
"Tasty beer and something I'm glad I tried, but it might be a bit much for me. I think a more traditional wit is more my style..."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average. Drinkability isn't good for me, I thought it was overly spiced and some of the spices like lavender just didn't work at all for me."
"D- Very smooth but a bit on the boozy side, great beer."
"Really like this interpretation. Easy to drink on a very hot day in NC in October."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Pretty full for a witbier; soft and creamy as well. ABV is 8% but I can't tell at all. Very drinkable beer from Boulevard."
"D - Once again, crisp, light and refreshing. A very enjoyable brew, but nothing to jump up and down about."
"It was a very tasty witbier. Something that goes great in spring and summer months. Had a refreshing value to it and a lot of flavor."
"Drinkability: I gotta give this brew some good marks here. It's light, crisp and refreshing, and easy to drink...but most importantly it's pretty tasty too. I would definitely recommend this brew to anybody. Thanks again, Kevin!"
"It's medium bodied. Spicy and dry. Strong coriander. Carbonation is nice in the mouth. It's drinkability is good, mouthfeel is ok."
"I liked this one quite a bit. My first Double Wit and I really enjoyed this one..."
"This beer is a joy to drink. One of the best."
"An excellent and unique tasting wit. Worth the price."
"Saw this one on tap at Oskar Blues Liquids and Solids, and wanted to try this one after really enjoying Great Divide's Double Wit the other day. This one was, sadly, not nearly as good. Poured from the tap a promising golden honey color, with a decent bit of foam. Decent herbal nose, with coriander, cardamom and a bit of orange peel. Similar on the palate, with a bit of alcoholic punch."
"Medium bodied, high carbonation, and easy to drink. Based on what I have tried so far, you cannot go wrong with any of the beers in the Boulevard Smokestack Series."
"Drinkability - An 8% ABV witbier? Wow. An amazing easy-drinking summer offering with a big beer heft and body. I would never have considered a witbier to be a ""sipper", but this is very close. Outstanding ""bending the style"" rules to show just what you can do with a wheat beer. Kudos to Boulevard for a great beer. Wish this was available locally."
"O: Solid selection, but nothing that blew me away. Pretty safe profile to introduce to less obsessed beer crowd."
"D: Easy to drink. bit to sour, and pretty strong, but a great beer, and i would buy it again!"
"Good double wit that I am so glad to try."
"All in all, this is the second brew from Boulevard that I've tried second to Saison Brett. This one definitely is a very solid brew and does not disappoint. This is not in the same category as Saison Brett, but it definitely does not fall far under. Try if you like banana bready tart beers. I'd say you should give one at least a try once. Great brew."
"D: At 8% this is a little dangerous because it is very well hidden. Really refreshing and flavorful. To be fair, I probably would have scored this higher for drinkability had it not been for the cork. I have calluses from that thing. I will never again look at a corked beer the same way. Yet, I am glad we persevered for this was an excellent beer."
"Drinkability? A very impressive Wit indeed and it's way too drinkable given the alcohol content. This is super good!"
"Overall impressions: Boulevard's Smokestack series hits another homerun with this beer. Their special releases always seem to be ""A" worthy."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while."
"Poured into glass and had very good head. Light coppery color. The smell has fruity distinctions, specifically pear and apricot. Beer is highly carbonated and is very fruity. The bitterness is acidic probably from orange peel and as mentioned on the label a lactic fermentation. No real flavor or smell of hops noted. No distinct flavor of sweetness or malt noted. I wish there would have been more flavor/spice from corriander or malt sweetness to balance the bitter fruit. Drinkability is good and beer has slight warming character. Overall not a bad beer but lacks some characteristics that I enjoy in Belgian Wits."
"D: Not one that I would finish the entire bottle, but definitely would share it with friends on a hot Oklahoma summer day."
"F: Dry, the spice flavors linger, with lots of citrus fruit zest, fruit flavors, Belgian malts and yeast, lemon, spices galore, and a slight creamy and juicy."
"Cork was almost impossible to get out of the bottle."
"Drinkability iis pretty high. I might even kill two 750ml bottles in a session. One of my favorite witbiers."
"Overall, a very nice beer, certainly worth your time."
"A very nice beer that drinks decently. This definitely drinks more like a triple or a quad more so than a wit."
"D - Here in Florida, we NEED beer like this. Super-refreshing, and still very substantial. Boulevard strikes again."
"Drinkability: 8.0%. Yep. I'm feelin' it. But it's not too noticeable or in your face, despite the lack of sweetness to cover up (maybe it's hidden in the spice). This one's a step above most of the double wits I've had - most tend to be sickly sweet, or overly spiced, or spiced in an inauthentic way. This one keeps the yeast notes at bay, and augment them with authentic earthy spices and overtones, and has a dry enough malt backbone that nothing's cloying or overpowering. Indeed, it's one of the better examples of the style I've had the pleasure of drinking. Recommended, and an exemplary standout if BA ever gives the ""doublewit"" it's own style."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is loads of orange peel and coriander. The flavor is lemons, oranges, spicy hops and a lot of coriander. Some alcohol is present in the flavor as well. Very soft, medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation."
"Drinkability is good. The alcohol is almost completely undetectable in the smell or taste."
"Poured a cloudy yellow with average head and no lacing. The aroma was spicy, with pepper,and light fruit,mainly citrus. The taste was spicy overtop a light maltiness. Some sweetness was evident and pepper was evident. A citrusy fruit was evident in the finish. Strong carbonation in the mouthfeel,which enhanced the wit flavours. Spiciness was a bit too strong to make this a very drinkable beer."
"Verdict: Kind of a wild card, think of Two Jokers as a strong Witbier with some slightly sour and menthol notes. I expected another boozy and bland ""double Wit," but found something a little more interesting."
"Taste is lemony wheat and coriander driven. Pithy, bitter citrus peel along with a hearty helping of alcohol. For me, the wit is a style that need not be imperialized, so that factors into my low rating for this beer. Not to mention there is no way in hell I could finish a whole 750 by myself. Belgian yeasties make their presence felt near the end, but it is not enough to change my feelings about the beer. I was barely able to choke down my half of the bottle. I enjoyed the Sam Adams and Southampton versions much better. Definitely my least favorite Boulevard offering, usually love their stuff."
"To me, the mentholated cough drop taste was too much and soured the enjoyment. Not one of my favorites from Boulevard."
"Good beer, one I'm glad to have toasted with as the Super Bowl started."
"D- This was a interesting beer that I had a couple glasses of. Good beer to try although I could see a lot of people really liking this then I wouldn't be able to get any..."
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a golden, hazy wheat with a big, fluffy, off white head that leaves no lacing as the beer recedes. This beer has some crazy head retention. There seems to be always an inch high hat sitting on top of my beer. The aroma is interesting. The first aroma that hits me is a slight lactic sourness that's backed up by some serious spicing. Cardamom, lemon zest, orange peel, clove all make an appearance. Also over ripe bananas and just a little bit of toast from the pale malts. The flavor is just as interesting. Its extremely spiced. Grains of paradise, cardamom, a bit of dried flowers, and clove all mashed together with some lemon peel. Also a slight toastiness to it. Unfortunately the slight sourness that comes out in the nose is completely lost on the flavor profile. I wish the Boulevard team would have sour mashed it a bit longer. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. I have to admit that I completely disliked this beer when it first came out, but it turns into a pretty easy drinking Wit. A lot of the sweetness died down which makes it easier to drink."
"Overall: looking back I gave it 4's all around. Which means good. But the least fav of the Blvd smokestack beers I've had."
"Bottle courtesy Diomede. Pours a hazy gold color with a big off-white head. Aroma heavy on spices with some apple/orange/banana esters and a bright coriander note. Fruity flavor with the same ester profile, a little tart, coriander and orange peel are apparent. Body is pretty full, carbonation is medium. Sweet but not too sweet."
"overall more of a berliner weiss than a wit."
"Very nice beer. At first I was a little suspicious of the higher alcohol content, but it works. Ditto the extra malt, which actually enhances the tartness and mouthfeel. Poured with a small to medium head and no lace. Color is a lighter amber. Aroma is citrus, spice, and malt. Flavor is malt, sour cherries, citrus, spice, and sweet sour. Body is full and carbonation is great. Very drinkable/session beer. Even with the alcohol (which is present but subtle)."
"Overall, an excellent beer and the best double wit that I've had. I'd been putting this one off as, while I love wits, I find most double wits to be too dominated by alcohol taste and not very good. Glad that I finally tried it. Highly recommend. Rotation - avail here in TX. Part of the Smokestack series so not sure how long it will be available so need to grab a few more while fresh. If stays in rotation will get a few a year."
"Conclusion: This is definitely an interesting beer and is fairly tasty. It's kind of like a cross between a Saison, a Tripel, and a really freaking boozy/heavy Wit. Which is all kind of strange. It's not something I love, or something I'd necessarily go out and get again. Something about the full body and the flavors just doesn't quite work for me."
"Pours a huge whitish head, extremely quickly diminishing. I've never seen a head form and disappear so quickly. Somewhat opaque body, light orange cloudy in color. Sweet spicy aroma, very floral, reminiscent of an Abbey Triple. Maybe coriander. Very fruity, light fruit like white grapes, pears. Not an overly strong aroma, might be related to the disappearing head. Sweet taste, orange peel, maybe clove. Not a strong taste. Diminishing aftertaste. Though a sweet spiciness lingers. Very mild tasting, almost bland. Billed as a double wit I expected more flavor. But it's not bad, just not as flavorful as I was expecting."
"Poured from 750 Ml corked bottle; herbal floral aroma, orange tan color with some cloudiness, tall tan colored head, lightly sour/tart taste, medium body, oily feel, soft carbonation, long smooth finish. I like this whole series of brews from Boulevard"
"Poured a cloudy orangish/yellow color with huge carbonation and big white head. Nose is spive, yeast, coriander, bananna. Taste is slightly spicy, banana, cloves yeast and a nice warming with subtle banana. Medium body. Balanced and damn good. Drinkable, hell yeah!"
"D: Very drinkable and a wonderful brew. Refreshing and interesting. You can tell this is still a wit...but more. I highly recommend this one and I continue to enjoy Boulevard's experimentation with this series!"
"Overall, this beer is big. I am glad I got a buddy to split it with because I would have a hard time with it by myself (just so many spice notes). But, for the abv, fairly drinkable I'd say."
"a bit darker as expected for the 'imperial' aspect. almost orange... good head but mild in retention. nose is quite herbal. palate a bit sweet and excessive coriander and orange peel in comparison to the malt, wheat, and hop qualities. a bit astringent. sour wouldn't be the right word seeing as the lactic qualities were undermined by spicing. good for american beligan... but not something i would recommend to wit fans. bottle was a bit mealy.. may been a bit off."
"D- Easily one of the best Witbiers that I have had. Nice bold flavor with a delicate feel."
"D: Very high. Delicious. I went out and bought a second right away to share. I'd definitely order another at a bar."
"Very cloudy almost luminous gold with a fizzy white head that dissipates and leaves no lacing. Sounds like that test from Kung Fu. Smells of lemons, apricots, and honey. Tastes peppery and citrus-y. Oranges and cinnamon. Very tasty, very spicy. Mouthfeel is aggressively carbonated but not so that I feel it will beat me up or steal my wallet. It is very drinkable, very refreshing and balanced. Daddy like."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. light and spritzy. delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, pretty refreshing stuff. Thanks Russ!"

"I had this beer when it first hit shelves and it was overwhelming, however trying it again several months later it has definitely mellowed into a much better beer. Still my least favorite of the Smokestack series so far."
"Served in a fat New Belgium tulip, yields a cloudy pale orange hued golden color with a loose two finger foamy white head that fades fairly quickly to spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is AMAZING. Earthy Belgian influence and aggressive strong orange peel fragrance marries well with a well balanced coriander and Midwest grains. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is lively yet smooth and creamy...wow! Full bodied and full flavored!! The earthy sweet grainy orange peel and balanced coriander taste rocks. The 8% ABV is well integrated and promises to 'get you there'. Another ""OUTSTANDING"" beverage from team Boulevard."
"Some might question the legitimacy of the style, but this is a fantastic double wit."
"Fluffy, a bit of tongue-prickle from the carbonation, and a warm-syrup finish. I'm glad this only happens once a year, this is far too sweet, too much candy corn, I've had all I can handle. Time to get on home, gotta get that song out of my head..."
"While I enjoy the powerful flavors in this, it seems to detract somewhat from the purity (and refreshing nature) of the style. Can't fault experimentation though, and overall this is a success."
"Taste kicks of with strong spiciness, clove washes it down. Some orange peel is still present. Fairly refreshing although the spices overwhelm if drank too quickly. Might be a tad too much carbonation sting, but overall this isn't too bad. I would drink again but probably wouldn't buy again just because the spices weigh a bit too heavy on my palate."
"Just as the name suggests, it's a big, fat Witbier, and a well done one. Another Smokestack winner."
"It certainly fits the bill of an Imperial Wit, not wimpy like Zon. Also it's nice to try a fresh one instead of one imported after who knows how long (Jan De Lichte, St. B). On my short list of top 5 Witbiers."
"D. Very easy drinking. A refreshing delicous beer. Complex but very well balanced."
"Very spicy up front with hints of cloves, coriander, cardamon, pepper and lemon zest and a yeasty/bread body with banana and citrus notes: lemon, orange peel, grapefruit and a subtle hop presence. Crisp and refreshing with a slight dry finish."
"Very nice. I am loving the Smokestack Series and this brew does not disappoint. Huge drinkability and amazing taste, 8% WHAAATTT? Highly recommended."
"This seems to blur the line between a Witbier and a Triple. An all around excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"HV"
"Drinkability is rather high. The 8% ABV is moderate, but well incorporated into the beer. The flavor profile for me is fantastic and incredibly drinkable. I'm really diggin it."
"Thanks, iasanlee, for the opportunity"
"Very nice strong wit, one of the best I've had, drinkability wise. All the flavors you expect from a wit, but amplified, yet still kept in very good balance with each other."
"Mouthfeel- Very medium, you could tell it had more than the average amount of alcohol in it."
"Drinks extremely easy for the ABV, I believe I've found my benchmark for this amped up take on the style! May be a bit too clean tasting for purists"
"Overall- Another phenomenal brew from the guys over at Boulevard. The Smokestack series are absolutely incredible and this one just adds to it!"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy deep orange color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice huge three-finger creamy white head, with lots of thick/creamy sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some yeast, corinder, bananna. The taste is slightly sweet, malty/yeasty, very nice touch of spices and banannas. Medium body. Very drinkable, an awesome brew, thanks Lane."
"D: Fantastic! Heather said it was a masterful combination of Wit and Saison. Awesome!"
"Pours a hazy golden colore with a huge white head. In fact the first pour was a glass full of foam. The head slowly settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Big aroma of lemons, maybe some vanilla, and alcohol. Wheat malt flavor with citrus hints, mostly lemon, and yeast phenols. Alcohol warmth in the finish. No need for people to add a lemon to this beer. Carries the alcohol well. The beer label claims tartness but I could not detect any or any other added spice. Still has a nice flavor. Bigger body than the average wit as expected. The level of carbonation is lively without being harsh. Slightly tingling. I do not think it lives up to the claims it has on the label but still has nice flavors. The high ABV limits drinkability."
"Pours a cloudy, maize/golden color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, citrus (banana/orange), hop, sweet malt, and tart malt. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is tart, crisp, and slightly thick. There is a high carbonation level. Tastes of cinnamon, yeast, citrus (banana), sweet malt, tart malt, and slight hop. Overall, a good blend, body, and great looking brew."
"D: For a double wit highly drinkable. This is one that I will definitely be seeking out again. The Smokestack Series continues to impress."
"drinkability: nice"
"Once again, Boulevard impresses me. For being a ""mediocre' brewery, I find their offerings more than impressive. Kudos, Boulevard!"
"Picked up a bottle at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove, MN for $9 or $10 and was not disappointed. This is another great addition to the Smokestack Series, I wish the regular line of Boulevard beers were this delicious. Now it's a heavily spiced beer and hits the threshold of non-beer flavors, but doesn't cross the line. The flavor, upfront, is a gentle mix of coriander (strongest flavor) followed by the grains of paradise (with a black pepper edge) and lavender. Of course in the background the yeast character comes through with mild vanilla and peppercorn, and a bit of bready wheat also pipes in to remind you of the malt bill. Certainly my favorite doube-wit to date. Very subtle, very deliicous."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes slowly into a full cap of lacing. This beer is a little darker than most traditional wit, but it's not a traditional wit. The aroma is cardamom, lavender and other soft floral notes, hints of black pepper, and very faint wheaty notes. This is a great smelling beer. It has both strength and complexity. The taste is more aggressive than the aroma. There is a lot of cardamom, hints of lavender, a lot of citrus, and a nice wheaty tang. Akin to the aroma, this is a great tasting beer. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. It is by far the best Imperial Wit I've yet taste. In fact it is the only good Imperial Wit I've yet tasted. Not because it is as close to tasting like a traditional wit as it can be, but because it is an extremely well crafted fusion of spices (some traditional, some not), and the traditional wheaty, tangy, citrus flavors of a Witbier. I really like how in the end I am tasting mostly Imperial Wit, but I can always taste reminders of the style it evolved from. Way to go Boulevard for creating such a unique, and tasty beer. Thank you."
"Not a bad Wit, not a real double in my book, especially for the ten spot it takes to buy the magnum. Overpriced, she be - better doubles are all over the market."
"Overall it was a very solid beer. I would have no issue with having this one again and I continue to be impressed with the boulevard lineup."
"Overall a fairly pleasing brew. Not sure what my buddies were expecting but it is a pretty well crafted beer. If anyone has had Boulevard ZON, don""t worry, this is actually good."
"Sampled from bottle. Pours cloudy yellow-orange with a creamy white head and thick lace. The aroma is subtle with some banana and pepper. Balanced, with bold yeast character. There's lots of pepper/clove and I'm assuming Boulevard went with another yeast for this beer other than a traditional wit biere yeast. The yeast character resembles what you'd find in a Belgian Strong Golden. There is some orange in the finish, but I'm missing the corriander's perfume. Medium bodied and highly drinkable for an 8% abv beer. This is the best 'double wit' that I've tried so far. Recommended!"
"A huge off-white head grows quickly and sticks around for a bit before fading and leaving curly chunks of lacing behind. Color is a hazy, pale yellow. Smells like a tyical wit, except all the elements are deeper, more robust. Coriander, malts, lemon, light fruit and green grass all mix well and rise pleasantly to the nose. Taste sweet and tangy with orange zest, sweet malts, lemon, yeast and a slight hint of alcohol heat in the end. Has a true medium body, and is well carbonated. This style seems to have had some problems moving into the double/imperial spectrum, but the Two Jokers hits the nail on the head. A near perfect balance across the spectrum, and a big character that doesn't sacrifice drinkability, but lets you know this isn't your father's witbier, makes for a spot on brew I will continue to seek out."
"Highly carbonated, a little thin but just fine for style. Lots of carbonation in the finish, a little biting with the citrus and herbs. Not a bad take, but not among my favorites."
"As a witbier and tripel fan, I have to admit I was really looking forward to this one. I have a mixed reaction to this beer - I really like it, but it doesn't meet the monumental expectations I created for it in my head. After the rest of the Smokestack series, I was expecting my dream beer. I'm guessing it is impossible to live up to that expectation."
"Blipped ""Hellbilly Joker"" by Hank III"
"Good stuff."
"Overall pretty surprising. I haven't been dissapointed by any of boulevard's recent beers."
"Poured this brew into a goblet. Hazy golden color with impressive head which recedes quickly with no lacing of course. Predominant scent is spicy clove. Highly carbonated mouthfeel - I enjoy it quite a bit. More spicy clove in the taste; also present is a very slight tartness reminiscent of a very mild sour. Alcohol isn't too noticeable. The third double wit I've ever had and definitely the best."
"750ml bottle $8.49. Vibrant, bright orange color. looks like a nectar, not much head when poured into a wine glass. Smells like citrus and tastes like biting into a powerful orange or nectarine, good stuff all around. This was the second American craft witbier I had today and they both deviated from the norm in a very good way."
"D: 8% ABV well hidden. Bottle went down very quick...too damned quick. Well done, again. Smokestacks rule!"
"d: when this got really warm, the flavors came out more, but unfortunately for me, nothing stood out about this beer"
"This is a very good witbier--on the verge of being great. Starts with fresh coriander, orange peel, and orange flesh. Slightly sour tartness blends with a nice backbone of crystal malt. A quick flash of boozy heat and sharp, grassy spices cut across the back of the palate alongside a spritzy carbonation level. The medium-light body finishes on the dry side, with a burst of funky sourness. All in all, Boulevard has crafted a beautiful example of the Witbier style that packs heftier-than-normal booze and spices, but doesn't over-do it and still maintains its drinkability. Bravo!"
"D - This is another great Smokestack brew. I was skeptical of a double wit, but this is really good."
"My favorite of the Smokestack's so far."
"Avoid if you dont like acidic overcarbonated beers."
"This is the first double wit I've ever had. Split four ways between me, my brother-in-law, my dad and my sister's boyfriend. Pours a hazy orange color with a bubbly head. Wheaty, citrusy in the nose. Taste is very light and refreshing for a double wit. Like the nose, it's wheaty and citrusy. A little bubbly in the mouth, but not overwhelming. Very tasty beer. Enjoying the smokestack immensely."
"Nothing left to write - smiling too much."
"Well, my concern over a double wit being put out was overrated. This is the best wit I've ever had. I shouldn't have doubted the brewmaster since I hear he is Belgian. At $7.49 a bottle this was a steal."
"d: When I heard Boulevard was doing a Double wit, I was actually disappointing. Does the world really need another wit? Couldn't Boulevard do something more exciting? Yes and no in that order. Wow, I mean...wow. Just when you think the style has nothing left to offer, Two Jokers comes around. This is a tremendous wit and this is coming from someone who isn't even much of a wit fan. I think this has Southampton, Allagash, St. Bernardus, Hitachino, and La Grande Blanche all beat. In my book, this is the new champion of the witbier category."
"Mouth is moderate and perfectly carbonated with a lingering sweetness in the aftertaste. Drinks easy and wonderfully on a hot night. Really liking the new Boulevard offerings Kepp em coming!"
"Easy to drink and I'll be happy everytime it comes around"
