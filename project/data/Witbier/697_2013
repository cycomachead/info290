I really wanted to like this beer, but honestly it was just not that good.  This is one of the few times I disagree with the Bros.  I had this beer at the Westin Inn in Napa, CA at a nice restaurant, so I figured lets give this a try! The beer started off very promising with a white color, almost the color of toothpaste. It had a very light aroma, but when I sipped it thats when it all went downhill.  The beer tasted like dirty dishwater, so bad I asked the waiter to bring me another.  I did not pour this one in hopes that maybe the soapy taste was a dirty glass, it was not. I drank the next one straight from the bottle.  It was terrible.  I don't know what spice they use in this but the spices simply do not work.  This is probably the worst beer I have ever had, which sucks because I paid $10 for it and I really wanted to like it.  I normally don't slam a beer like this, but this is putrid.","ronniebruner","Jan 12, 2015"

Let's hope that becomes a trend). A pale cloudy straw yellow with some rocky, sudsy white head. Aroma of citrus (orange, lemon, lime), spices (clove, nutmeg, ginger, coriander), and a malty depth not typically observed in this style ... Has a clear lager malt flavor as well. Interesting. Some bubble gum and pineapple notes vie with the aforementioned citrus. A brown spice flavor gathers steam over the course of sips (nutmeg, which is actually in the brew according to the label). Moderate body, seems on the thick side for the style, with the carbonation not violent but certainly assertive. Finish dry, rather earthy even. Unique wit. I enjoyed the emphasis on the malts and spice. My bottle may have been a tad old.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 07, 2014"

4.22,3.2,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"a pretty famous beer here, it has eluded me somehow until now. picked this up under 6 bucks over at colorado liquor mart, who is still chugging along with some hidden gems in the back there. a nice take on a wit, different than almost all of them because of (what i perceive anyway) this fresh ginger in here. a blonde beer with a golden flare, clear for the style, and while there are a ton of bubbles in it, no head really ever builds up. the nose is almost like ginger ale, its so potent to me, i have to believe there is real ginger in it. belgian type yeast is also fruity, while some malt other than wheat i think makes an appearance, giving some light caramel flavors as a base. ginger and cracked pepper in the finish, this could pass as a saison on the yeast character alone, less belgian than saison in that regard. super refreshing, and even though it looks flat, there are a lot of bubbles here in solution. my first beer from this operation is a winner, i like this a lot, different from the masses but still comfortably within what the style asks for. perfect hot weather refresher. super dig it.","StonedTrippin","Jul 24, 2014"

4.48,9.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"The beer pours a decent white and bubbly head before dissipating quickly but still leaves a bubbly film on the beer. The beer is a clear pale golden straw color that has slight hints of orange. The beer has a fairly complex aroma. The smells that are detected vary from hints of apricot, honey, and peach along with a slight and almost undetectable hint of citrus hops. The beer's taste is similar to its smell but not as complex. The most dominate taste is that of the Belgian yeast flavor while the flavors present in the smell are more subtle. The peach and apricot are still there but not as prominent. However, the orangish citrus hops taste is more noticeable. The beer feels smooth and a little creamy. The beer is lightly medium bodied. Overall, a fantastic beer and one that I would definitely buy again.","HattedClassic","Nov 28, 2013"

The wheat also comes through in the flavor profile along with some citrus notes. This offering is certainly light-bodied, which fits the style.

Scents of orange peel, which is quite pronounced, grainy wheat, sweetness, chamomile, allspice and clove, fruity and yeasty esters, incredibly complex for a witbier and extremely pleasant. Taste begins with yeasty wheat bread, moving into citrus peel, slight peppery spiciness, herbal hops, and finishing with wheat cracker and a strong graininess. Aftertaste is yeasty and grainy with some herbal notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, with a nice yeasty feel present as well. Overall it's an amazing witbier with a depth of complexity in it's aroma that no other witbier I've had has reached, and and an excellent flavor hitting the wibier style with a nice herbal hop character that adds some complexity there as well, the mouthfeel is standard for the style but good. It's just a fantastic witbier, with an excellent complexity to it, and it's just plain pleasant to drink. Well worth it's $5 price tag. An excellent craft beer out of Japan","Auraan","Oct 06, 2013"

Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light foamy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big clove, wheat, pepper, coriander, lemon, orange zest, herbal, earth, and yeast spices. Excellent aromas with nice strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of lemon, pepper, coriander, clove, orange zest, wheat, bread, herbal, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus zest, pepper, coriander, clove, wheat, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with solid complexity. No cloying flavors at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier.

Any sloppiness it may have only makes the drinking experience more fun! This is really worth checking out for the flavorful yeast alone... you can just taste the vitamins and nutrients they carry in the aftertaste, and the vivid tartiness is unlike any wit bier I've ever had. Despite the price tag (over $6), I'd say it's a beer that I'd revisit again. Welcoming in every way, it's guaranteed to improve your day with every sip, just as it did for me!","magictacosinus","Sep 08, 2012"

The aroma draws you in, before you bring your nose to the glass you can smell this beer. The nose is of big time citurs, orange and a big lemon part. There is also a hint of pepper. The taste follows suit with a big and smooth sweet citrus taste with orange and lemon taking the front and middle. A little pepper spice comes in at the back end with a slight tartness at the end. The mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer, the drinkability is off the charts and you want more of this beer.

Seems like coirander and some kind of candied fruit I can't put my finger on and a hint of white pepper in the finish.

Excellent beer overall, especially in the summer months. Looking forward to checking out other offerings from this brewery.","IPhantom","Jun 18, 2011"
4.08,-0.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall- Very impressed by this one to be honest, I like wheat beers where that spice flavour is not overpowering and well balanced by all the other aspects that are supposed to be in a quality wheat beer, and this one really delivered on all those aspects. There is a nice spice presence right off the bat but it is quickly balanced by that great bready wheat flavour, hints of citrusy fruits and a perfect amount of yeast in there as well, very easy drinking beer that goes down smooth and crisp.

Taste has about the same, citrus zest and abit of spritzy carbonation upfront, before a bit of softer wheat character come through with more nutmeg. Simple in most respects, but adequate proportions of the components make this a nice drinker. Carbonation is medium high, and most evident at the beginning of each sip.

3.87,-5.4,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pale yellow and turbid. Pouring produces a finger of pale white head that retains poorly and doesn't lace. Lots of nutmeg in the aroma. Less coriander than nutmeg, but still a lot of that as well. Citrus scents are muted, providing more of an underlying background for the spices. Flavour is tangy and lemony with a hint of orange, and strong spice notes. Mild bitterness. The coriander is much more assertive on the tongue than it is on the nose. Light-bodied with a tonne of tiny bubbles giving it a spritzy texture. This is a well made wit, though my personal preference is for something a little more heavy-handed with the orange and a lighter touch with the spices. I find this to be a very interesting take on the style.","mintjellie","May 21, 2011"

There is a decent bread/yeast presence that adds to the mouthfeel as well as some slight banana and citrus flavor. As the palate adjusts to the spice there is a prominent lemon juice/rind character that balances things out a bit. Slightly tart and refreshing making it pretty quaffable. A good attempt at the style but a bit too heavy on the spice for my liking.","corby112","Feb 12, 2011"

A bit of a band-aid aftertaste, particularly as it gets warmer, but not enough to be too distracting.

4.52,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"I am a devout Craft Beer drinker and have recently begun to explore some interesting Asian crafts. I was originally introduced to this beer at a wine bar and it was paired with a hearty artisan Mac and Cheese. The bottle itself is interesting but once you smell the aroma you know you are in for a treat, because it is loaded with hints of citrus, sourdough bread, and spice. It is like smelling summer. The color of the beer is what it is to be expected (cloudy pale yellow) and obviously unfiltered with a medium frothy head. The flavor of the beer is not overwhelming; notes of a ""warhead"" candy are delicately balanced with floral and yeast. The Asian flavor comes out with some bitter orange and eastern spices to create a unique profile on the palate. Although the forward taste passes quickly, the aftertaste is creamy and refreshing. This is a good beer to introduce to a woman who doesn't like beer, because the flavor is mild with hints of sweetness and sour (like a lemon drop). A few days ago I tried this beer again and paired it with spicy BBQ tri-tip and pork, which totally worked because the refreshing characteristics really cut through the spicy-fatty meat. It was a summer hit with fairly tough beer critics! Crisp, light, refreshing, and almost too easy to drink. I actually let it come to room temp as well to test its drink-ability, and was happy to find it still tasted pretty darn good at 67 degrees","SteelerChris","Jun 17, 2010"

I've never tasted a witbier like this and it's like a spritzy lemony sports drink. Nothing like a witbier that I'm looking for.

The aggressive scent does not signify the most aggressive taste... all the components from the scnet are there, but a tad more muddled. The tart, acidic and sweet notes a bit more present in the taste as well as the biscuityness. Medium bodied, slightly oily feeling and dry finnish.

I don't have too much experience with Wits as I usually don't like them and end up being a bit bland, that was not the case here.

Ginger seems pretty dominant in my opinion but there's a lot going on here. A strong carbonation makes this one nice and refreshing. A great/unique representation of the style that I think is a love it or hate it kind of beer. Personally I don't care for the flavors but I think somebody who likes the spicy/perfumy wits will definitely love this one.

Fuzzy light orange to yellow liquid, easy to see the particulate floating inside, given lighter hue it's just about entirely opaque. Clove, coriander, cinnamon stick and orange zest do most of the work in the nose, straw, meadow grasses and garden herbs right there, close to earthy at moments, apricot and peach pit all for fruit scents. Medium-bodied, the carbonation doesn't lift as much as paste the liquid to the roof of your mouth. Sour orange, grapefruit citrus an eye opener, coriander, ginger spice, white pepper, wheatgerm, develops just the right amount of rougher texture to extend the finish.

There is a certain floral grassy like smell that I have never encountered. It may be strange but it is bold and assertive which I like. The taste is not like your typical wit. It is very spicey kind of like a light tripel. There is some pepper, a strong taste of turmeric powder, cinnamon. And nutmeg flavors throughout and just enough hops to make it slightly bitter. There seems to be a lot of carbonation to this beer from the looks but it does not overtake your mouth. I would say it is a typical Mouthfeel for the style.

As soon as I started pouring I was overcome in a good way, by flowery citrus scents of lemon and lime and a kind of vegetable rhubarb aroma. Later on the smell took on a kind of cologne like presence. Tasted similar to the smell with big lemon/lime flavors up front and a more bitter taste than others of the same style.

Smells spicy, with medicinal phenolics, citrus, a touch of coriander, yeast, and a light musty character. The flavor is very much the same, with a tart sourness, sharp coriander, orange and lemony citrus, spicy/grassy, peppery and musty hops, and a background of flavorful wheat. It has a light, well-carbonated body that imparts a medium finish on the palate, and is quite refreshing. Delicious and thirst-quenching, and it tastes a bit wild - like a spicy Berliner weisse; or even a witbier spiked with Orval.

Definitely smells better than it tastes in my opinion... the aroma is full of citrus, lemon, vanilla, wheat and coriander which is very noticeable... the taste is very pepperish - almost reminds me of a lemon-flavored seltzer... much more so than the Nest Weizen which was my first sample from this brewery... In my opinon, there is too much of a pepper flavor and not enough vanilla and citrus that I look forward to when sampling a witbier... Would opt for a less expensive Belgian or German sample anyday, even though the mouthfeel was good and the drinkability on this brew is great... goes down smooth, very crisp and clean...

Shows the typical canary straw color, but without the soft, glittery hue expected. Head retention is loosely knit, unlike the creamy, foamyness expected either. Along with lemongrass in the nose, there is nice hints of corriander, curraco, and estery yeast qualities. Though these esters show in the flavor, the lemon dominates and religates the other, softer, flavors to support the citrus and not compliment as they should. The beer's lemony qualites keep the beer from becoming creamy or full on the palate, but does help the drinkability and cutting through the thirst.

I would have to say that up to now, I have not been the biggest fan of Witbiers. This one is quickly changing my mind. Citrus is not overbearing, but is definitely dominant. Coriander is present but not in too assertive of a fashion. Very well balanced. Excellent beer, highly recommended. Who would have expected an excellent witbier from a Japanese brewery?

It was a very good representation of a witbier, and if I had not have known that it was japanese I might have mistaken it for a euro wheat.

The nose is filled with spices, mostly coriander and cloves. Very fresh-smelling and appetizing. The flavor, though, is what sets this beer apart. It manages to be spciy, refreshing , and smooth all at the same time. First off, this beer nips at the front and sides of the tongues with spices and carbonation; the overall sensation is spicy, with coriander dominating and a hint of sour green apple in the background. The spices are balanced by some nice grass notes and a bit of nutty malt toward the back of the palate. It's an exceptionally light-footed beer -- I keep thinking of the word ""effervescent"" -- in spite of the flavor punch it packs.

Odd aroma of slightly sulfuric Saaz hops, orangepeel, and coriander. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Taste has spicy coriander, lemony citrus, wheaty cracker, yeast, orangepeel, and herbal hops that come together quite well. The flavors are all restrained, and the high carbonation helps them meld into a very flavorful, light bodied Wit. Very interesting flavor profile, but it works well. Very refreshing, and an excellent choice as a session ale. Based on my experience with other offerings from this brewery, this is basically a Hitachino Lite.","merlin48","Mar 08, 2005"

This would be a perfect beer for sushi or any oily fish dishes. I would think this would be great for fish and chips for those that like lighter styles. The flavor scrubs anything off the palate. Drinkability is good as well. This is light and flavourful. Belgian wits are not my favourite, but this one is to style and really good. I would put this up there with Allagash white and above Hoogarten on my list of Wits. As a side note I had a sixer of this and Hoogarten in the DBF- the wife left one of the Hitachino, and there are still 5 Hoogarten.

It really has quite a rich intriguing aroma to it. The beer is well carbonated, which in combination with the spices gives this a peppery-spicy start as I take my first sip. This is actually quite tasty, and quite a bit different (either because of the spices used, or a combination of the yeast used and the spicing) than your average Wit type beer. There is some solid spicy notes here that seem to be driven by ginger, and perhaps some pepper. It is quite dry and light on the palate. This beer must be super spicy when fresh.

It began with a orange-citrusy coriander-tinged firm and dry malt base that exuded a refreshing acidity. This acidity increased in strength through the finish, which left lingering robust flavors of bitter orange, ginger, black peppercorn, nutmeg, grapefruit, and coriander.

4.8,17.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall: After the good impression I had once I tried the Celebration Ale 2004, when I spied the White Ale I figured I would give this one a whirl also. Not exactly inexpensive, but well worth splashing the extra coin on this one.","TheLongBeachBum","Jan 02, 2004"

4.3,5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This wit beer poured a cloudy, golden color with white foam that settled to leave a thin coat. The smell was fruity (citrus and green apples) with some wheat. The taste was a bit tart and fruity (green apples) with citrus and wheat flavors and a bit of yeast coming through. Overall a very nicely balanced taste. The mouthfeel was smooth and tart (almost puckering). The body was medium with modest carbonation feel. There was a lingering yeasty and tart flavor. This was a very enjoyable beer fresh on tap.","UncleJimbo","Dec 02, 2003"

4.5,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Boy this is an in your face refresher?! The beer pours a hazy golden. There is minimal head retention yet a nice amount of sticky lace stays with the glass to the end. Some beer diamonds as this must be a minimally filtered brew? The aromas are awesome and perfect for an Asian white! Instantly, aromas of freshly zested orange peel, ginger root and Asian spices attack the nose. I am immediately transported to my favorite Japanese Restaurant and am craving sashimi and especially teryaki Sea Bass! On the palate more of the same. Refreshing to the max, orange and ginger flavors dance an asian jig, and are clean and as fresh tasting as is the cusine of the region! This is a fantastic Beer! I will ask for it to be brought in at my favorite Asian joints as I think this would be un-beatable with the cuisine of the bottles region. Expensive yes-well worth the expense, no doubt!! Drink less and drink slower if you must.","moulefrite","Aug 22, 2003"

4.08,-0.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"I definitely had some apprehension about this one. Belgium and Japan couldn't be further apart. What is more, this is a tough style to brew. It had a bittersweet palate with a citrusy aroma. The citrus seemed more lemon or grapefruit than the usual bitter orang, but I'm not complaining. As far as wit beers go this one had a unique taste that despite it's uniqueness still fits the category. The citrusy bitterness mixes with an awesome spiciness. The combination makes this beer an enjoyable thirst quencher!","andyj","Jul 22, 2003"
3.62,-11.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Ah, my first Japenese Belgian. This is probably the best Japanese beer I have sampled so far. Pours a murky light orange with a thin white head. Quick lacing, and some sediment at the bottom of the glass. Strong citrus aroma (all orange), with a pinch of spice as well. Crisp and refreshing with a decent balance of orange, ginger, yeast and peaches. Also has a fairly crisp finish. Pricey at over $3 for a 12oz. bottle but a good summer brew.","Dogbrick","Jul 21, 2003"
4.22,3.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Hello, Mr. Owl. He's funny...thus I shall keep the cap until I lose it. This beer pours out a clear golden color with a good sized white head...then the chunky yeast comes flowing out, making this baby quite cloudy. Rather large bubbles are constantly cascading from the bottom of the glass. The aroma of this beer is complex and delicious. Cloves and coriander are quite strong. I wish my car smelled like this beer. Flavor is not as complex as I had expected, but I possibly set my expectations too high. Orange peel and citrus seem to come out the most, with the clove and spices coming in right behind them. Finishes very dry. Definitely a recommended Wit, light and refreshing while still maintaining a nice flavor and decent complexity.","IrishRedRock","Jul 18, 2003"
3.7,-9.5,3,3,5,3,2.5,"This brew pours a small white brown head of finely sized bubbles. It had a transparent yellow rice brew colored body with a lot, burp, of carbonation rising throughout my mug. There were a lot of particles that could bee seen floating in the body of the brew. It has a very rice like aroma and a very fizzy, burp, taste of fruit like apples. The flavor was OK, but nothing special. It was a very average brew that I would pass on in lieu of much better brews.","TheDM","Jul 13, 2003"

If I was lookin' for a date I would put a dab of this behind the ears! Hazy cloudy pale orange color with nice carbonation in the glass and a nice persistant white head. Upfront taste of lemon zest, corriander, and ginger. This is quickly followed by a sweet wheat/marshmellow sweetness. The finish balences the brew with a hint of nobel hops. Medium body, quite a full mouth for a wit. A must try for the white beer fan. A little dab will do ya!","frank4sail","Jun 23, 2003"
3.23,-21,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Cloudy and yellow looking very true to the style. Great packaging with a painted owl for a logo. I'm a big fan of spiced white ales but this one was overpowered by ginger. Good acidity and mouthfeel was good. Surprised to see a Japanese brewers interpretation of this style. Would be better if it weren't for being heavy on the ginger.","BierReise","Jun 03, 2003"
4.15,1.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"11 oz bottle. Pours a golden yellow with a moderate head that didn't last, and leaves only a small ring of lace. Floral aroma with a hint of spice. The taste is a highly carbonated, and the spicyness and tartness dominates the finish. No real hops detected. It's not a bad beer, but I don't think its quite my type of drink.","Indybeer","May 30, 2003"

4.42,8.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Comes in the distinctive Hitachino bottle with the distinctive owl. It pours a yellowish-gold with a smallish white head, despite the seemingly high carbonation content. The smell is citrus (more orange than lemon) and spice. Although a hint of floral smell is present, a floral flavor really comes through from the first sip. It's highly drinkable and, but for the price, would make a good session beer. Good stuff.","mickeymac","May 01, 2003"
2.15,-47.4,2,2,2,3.5,2,"This brew poured a quick dissolving head with no lacing on my mug. In my opinion it had a fruity and citrusy aroma to it. It was extremely carbonated/fizzy.

4.08,-0.2,3,5,4,4,3.5,"The flavor was as intense as the aroma. Rather soft mouthfeel and not as sweet as the aroma suggested. Again, the primary flavor struck me as jasmine, like an herbal tea flavoring, and quite appropriate for a unique oriental take on the style. The beer was very interesting, but more of a novelty rather than something I would want on a frequent basis, given the innovative but almost overpowering spicing.","Brent","Apr 09, 2003"
3.8,-7.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a chalky gold, with an initial big foamy head. Head quickly settles to a fine lace atop the brew. Aroma full of spices (coriander really stands out) and citrus, with the smell of wheat hiding underneath. Spices are almost overwhelming in the flavor - tons of coriander, clove and I think perhaps ginger and hints of sage. Plenty of citrus notes as well, with a solid grainy base of wheat. Light, crisp mouthfeel. Very smooth. A very refreshing beer, for a warm spring afternoon.","Viking","Apr 04, 2003"

4.28,4.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured hazy and yellowish with lemongrass and coriander in the nose. Superfine spritzy carbonation. The nose has more spice than the taste. Very clean and a little citrus with some yeast thrown in for good measure. Medium to full-bodied, this is a thirst quencher and also a big brew to relax with. This was mu first Japanese craft beer, and I was very pleasantly surprised.","yen157","Mar 30, 2003"
3.95,-3.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a light yellow color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it subsided. Much like a float. A heavy amount of rapid moving carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, coriandar and citrus. A flavor of of malt and corindar. Fairly light beer. Not bad for this style and much better than the milk/lacto stout they make. My second venture into this Japanese brewer.","Wildman","Mar 11, 2003"

I smelled, then tasted this beer, and couldn't figure out the spice used in it... near the end of the beer, it finally hit me... ginger! Has a very intriguing aroma of ginger, citrus, and wheat. Flavor began with an upfront taste of fresh ginger and orange, with a touch of wheat and some malt sweetness to balance things out. Had a thin to medium body with medium carbonation.

The taste is wonderful, I get more orange taste than some of the other flavors described by others. I did seem to taste some ginger. It is a nice change to get some orange flavor in a white ale. A lot of the time I get blasted with a little too much coriander. A nice tangy flavor. Very refreshing.","mjohn27603","Nov 16, 2002"
4.07,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Turbid orange hue, topped by a porcelain white head that settles readily into a thin layer. Notes of candied ginger and dried orange peel dominate the aroma, with raw, fresh coriander and black pepper secondary. A snap of candy - like sweetness upfront immediately yields to curacao bitterness and nuttiness from the yeast. Mellow coriander and slightly spicy fresh ginger emerge mid palate along with a dryish, pseudo lactic grainy mild wheat tartness. Moderately bodied, w/ a smooth mouthfeel from the yeast in suspension and perhaps oats. Finishes relatively clean, w/ bready sweetness coating the tongue. Nest White is a clean and enjoyable Wit, but is a touch tame esterwise. The judicious use of spices lend excellent overall balance and drinkability.","marc77","Nov 13, 2002"
3.78,-7.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pale pineapple color, opaque with yeasties.  Head is short lasting and non-lacing.  Acrid aroma, touch of wine and strong cheese.  Maltier than I expected from the aroma, sour lemon and high carbonation dominate the initia flavor but then a sense of sweetness, nutmeg, cedar needles, and anise leaven the mix a bit.  Finishes with a peppery hopping and an aftertaste like an orange Life Saver candy.  Too astringent a White for me, not very drinkable, but there are big qualities in this beer.","ADR","Oct 27, 2002"
4.12,0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Cloudy dark golden color, some shiny colors depending on the light. Nice yeast bottom goodness makes for a great full fluffy tan head. Huge critus and floral aromas, nearly too much for me, but it settles and wears on you. Taste was a combination of oranges, cloves, ginger, coriander, and spicy peppery, almost hot finish. This would get a 5 on the orginality scale. Full of new flavors on every sip.  Crisp, light bodied, and refreshing. I liked thier hefeweissbier version better. This is also worth picking up.","StevieW","Sep 30, 2002"

Creamy white sticky head over a fluorescent orange/yellow beer.  Very cloudy, with an aroma of citrus cut only with faint yeast aroma.  Well bodied, with a very easy drinking creamy mouth feel. The taste initially hits with a flood of citrus flavors, with a noticeable sensation of hops. The aftertaste reminds me of fresh pine, with a hint of hops.  Very very nice, expensive beer from Japan.","jackndan","Aug 22, 2002"
5,22.2,5,5,5,5,5,"I used to love Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale but it is no longer for sale in MI. Belgian Wits have always left me wanting more flavor. This is the answer. Highly articulated flavors of orange, coriander, nutmeg, ginger, lemon merengue, and spice exist in perfect balance. The body is paradoxically almost solid, with aromas and flavors bouyantly rolicking in the foam, as well as vapor-thin, responding to the slightest pressure by melting and transforming into a different arrangement of sensations. Tight bead, viscous, it melts in your mouth and leaves a whistle-clean bright citrus note that goes on and on. Absolutely beautiful.","putnam","Aug 21, 2002"

Sweet & spicy, full of sugary clove, ginger, and light citrus notes as well as some whisps of maltiness. Quite unique. The body is medium light and very creamy. The flavor comes on strong but finishes oh-so-soft, starting with a bright fruitiness, followed immediately by a light-but-mouthcoating maltiness as it crosses the palate, and eventually receeding into a long lasting finish with a light fruit, ginger, citrus, and soft maltiness that is not at all sticky. A little bit of a spice bite on the front of the tongue. Fairly complex for a white ale. Unique. Immensely refreshing and very enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Aug 13, 2002"

I thought I felt some wasabe kick although it could be my imagination; the finish has a similar effect of scraping out the sinuses and the back of the throat (similar to some pharmeceuticals, too). Definite yogurt characteristics, perhaps due to yeast. Nice blend of Japanese and east Mediterranean flavors. Attack is gingery, but not as refreshing as many wits; more heavy duty and may be be best appreciated with robust Japanese-style cuisine. Bubbly on the tongue, smooth in the belly. I think I'll get the 750 bottle next time. Yum.","Thrasher","Jun 02, 2002"
