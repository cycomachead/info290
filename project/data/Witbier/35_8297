Not much aroma on this, what is there is hay and maybe a bit of light fruits. Flavor comes in as a bit watered down, some yeast, a few hitns of pear or apple. Easy drinker, with barely any real belgian yeast or spice that i would be looking for with the style. Nice to have the option from SA, but pretty mediocre.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

It's not that it's a bad beer, but I think it's an underwhelming brew for what I was expecting and I know it can be brewed with more umph!

The White ale is a yellow unfiltered beer with decent carbonation and white head that seems to be lacing nicely. The nose is very subtle, but I sensed orange peel and some spice. The taste is typical of most witbiers...there is a tingling of the buds from the spices they brewed the beer with then is ome off the pallete nice a crisp. A decent beer for after hockey.

Not much happening in the nose - faint citrus rind and a trace of coriander. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a slightly bready character.

Very light coriander as well, touch of honey. Overall aroma is delicate, but decently balanced. Flavors are well melded and coincide with the aroma, but without the metallic tones and more of the bready, cereal malt notes in the finish. Somewhat of a light/medium body, perhaps a little heavier than I'd like in a witbier, but well carbonated and crisp.

Well, not in the aroma, other than light brown sugar. I would have expected some coriander; maybe it's there, I just don't smell or taste it. Other aroma of light wheat flavor is pleasant. Taste is bursting with orange peel and wheat. No other spices tasted. Probably a good session beer for wheat beer lovers. Light-bodied beer with a dab of sour aftertaste.","ToAzwethinkweizm","Nov 30, 2010"

Smells kinda sweet with a nice citrus aroma of lemon and assorted spices. Taste like a somewhat weak wheat ale, and has the same vibe as the summer ale and coastal wheat, of which both I hate. Very clean mouth feel and taste despite all the spice going on here, the high carbonation probably helps push most of that aside. Overall a decent brew, but definatly doesn't deserve a spot in the SA winter classic's pack.

Can't really taste any sort of spices outside of the citrus peels. Mouthfeel is also a bit lacking, doesn't have the effervescent kind of carbonation I expected.

The spiced character is more pronounced in the flavor, along with more of the light banana cream and mild yeast flavors that were noticeable in the aroma.

The mouth feel was light and watery. I will have to admit at first the flavor was weak but about half way through it started to become more robust. All in all I like that Samuel Adams is not afraid to try different seasonal styles but I don't like how they have sacrificed boldness to sell to the general public.","skunk","Apr 03, 2009"

I have tried this beer twice and I find the wheat beer basis for this beer is mediocre at best, and the 10 spices are completely forgettable and musky. The beer does NOT adhere to the Witbier style and lacks the complexities that come with more suspended yeast, better malted wheat, and more interesting spices. I found this beer to be extremely over hyped. For the same price you can get Hoegaarden, which is a superior beer in every possible way and the standard for the style.

A mild but tastey bread based flavor. Very smooth with some fullness in body while providing a tangy, well carbonated refreshment. Crisp fruit overtones as noted in the aroma, even cherry perhaps.

The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with some head, retention, lacing. The smell and taste are just too subdued. You'll get some coriander, banana, some spices, lemony hints, maybe some other fruits emanating from the yeasts used in fermentation. The beer is just too watery, too safe, and too middle of the road to be of much interest. It's okay, it is fairly representative of the style, but like so many other SA offerings, this is just an above average beer.

But I swear there is a zesty, peppery smell to it. The taste is rather dull, there are light hoppy notes and the orange and lemon come out a little as do the spices, but nothing stands out in particular. There's no spice that stands out, not a strong fruit flavor and not a strong hop bit lead to a thinnish, almost watery smooth mouthfeel.

On the palate, substantial malt flavors, balanced with more citrus elements than the aroma possesses. Very smooth malt flavors and subtle spicing, but little in the way of acidity or refreshment.

I was pleasantly surprised by not only the extreme drinkability of this brew, but also the very good balance which exists between its components. I rarely find a beer that I feel has a good balance of smell, taste, ""mouth after feel", feel, drinkability, and overall balance. Perhaps a bit over carbonated, the carbonation is the first to hit the mouth, followed quickly by sugary-wheat almost powered taste, as if a ground piece of wheat was poured directly into the batch, matched equally well later on by great coriander, orange, medium grain, and light spritzer flavors. These initial tastes are followed finally by a slightly deeper and more syrupy malt taste and feel, leaving a small layer of aftertaste on the tongue and back of the mouth as the sip finishes. The during sip flavors are by far the least substantial aspect of the ale. The drinkability of this ale is superb. Having a few of these back to back would not at all be unpleasant. A great ale, definitely and especially in Spring or Summer settings. I would buy again in a heartbeat, especially to be enjoyed with food. A-.","herefordjeep","Feb 24, 2008"

My first thought was that this brew would be overkill, but it turns out to be a pretty decent witbier. The beer pours opaque apricot, and is topped with a finger of light beige head. Nice malts in the nose, along with tangy wheat, floral notes, and some anise and vanilla. It is floral and fruity on the palate, with a peppery spiciness, coriander, perhaps some berries, a mild/medium bitterness, and anise and vanilla which make a cameo near the end. The body is light and lighlty carbonated, yet manages to remain smooth, and it imparts a medium finish.

Although served in a non-chilled tumbler, it was refrigerator-standard 'cold from draught', so I wasn't able to appreciate the nose as much as I might have liked. I immediately detected a funky, off-odor, as if soured or pickled, which is the common sort of bacterial infection/infestation of the tap or line that I find in a number of bars. Aside from that, there's a natural sweet/sour character to this beer, along with the expected (Belgian I assume) yeast character which is pleasant. The nose did improve as the beer warmed in my hand (I had two in a row : ), as did the taste, and to that end the real treat is in the tasting. Sweet/sour/tangy on the first sip, which seems to be a short and dry sip. Pale, bready, and biscuity malts provide the sweetness and add to the smooth and creamy body, aided of course by the suspended yeast. Notes of banana and (light) clove . . . Not quite medium-bodied. There's great balance between the sweet and tangy, neither one pushes it's weight too much. I'll note that the 'off-nose' did not affect the drinkability. Light citrus notes of lemon rind and ripe tangerine. Only a touch spicy and a bit ""soapy"" in agood way. Would make for a good pair with lighter entrees and a better pair (as a foil) to spicy, hot dishes. The last time I had this was several years back, bottled, and I believe I only made mental notes, but it fairly impressed me at the time. I'll definitely try it again, in either format.

Nice malty tones stick around the entire time with a slight citric tinge and the only bitterness comes from what I presume would be the corriander or orange peel. Couldn't find the hops in this one.

The smell is of mild citrus and spice with a little yeastiness in the nose. Lemon, Orange, hints of coriander and yeastiness come through in the taste.

A challenge that is quite tough considering the potency of flavor coming from this beer. It pours a cloudy light orange with a white head that faded quickly. Smells mostly of citrus, wheat, and many sweet notes. It smells of a variety of fruit, I cannot pull out orange distictly, but it is in there. The taste is sweet with wheat as expected, and finishes clean with more body than expected. The carbonation adds a creamy texture, and is very subtle. The balance of the beer is done well, especially mixing all those flavors into one. This one is an easy drinker, even with the strong flavor, which usually get annoying, this one stays crisp and refreshing. Very enjoyable, another good one from Sam.

You would never mistake a Sam White for a Harpoon UFO. In comparison, Sam tastes like candy. But the same thing that attracted me to the beer in the first place, now drives me away. The low hop ratio, the odd sweetness, the diversion from style gets a bit tired. I would still order it on tap when it magically appears in the winter. But I no longer horde cases in the basement. It's a good beer but not great.","JimFalzone","Dec 26, 2006"

Typical nose of coriander and dried citrus rind over a grainy, wheatish malt. In the mouth it's crisp, smooth, and lightly dextrinous. The flavor is again fuller than some, but with more malt than spice or orange peel. Nice. Gently tangy. Nice spice profile that's more than just coriander.

The flavor is good, not as dry as desired but it does have a slight spicy tart bite at the end that is nice. Mostly I get malt on the sweet side and a little other complexity, fruity flavors like apples and lemons (the latter comes through with that tart bite I mentioned). This is OK, I don't think its complex enough or dry enough to be a witbier but its kind of like Blue Moon except better than that from what I remember. Kind of like an Americanized witbier (although maybe that would have a good dose of bold hops, that's an idea for homebrewing some time...)","KroMagnon","Jun 16, 2006"

It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. This is not an every-day, easy-drinking ale, but its wonderfully complex for the style.

Smell is odd, maybe even a bit metallic, but there's a strong wheat smell there, and a weird chemical scent. Taste is much the same. For some reason this reminds me of beer from a can, with a taste of tin and some strange chemical quiality to it. The bready yeasty wheat is there but it's not interesting enough to get the off tastes out of my mind.

The aroma of this beer is quite delicious, unfortunately a bit better than that of the beer itself in my opinion, quite sweet with a taste of spices, unusual but in a good way, I think. It tastes very wheaty, with the spices quite evident, don't ask me to name them, my cooking skills are limited to ramen and mac & cheese, but its good... it finishes somewhat sweet and spicy, but with a mild hint of hops to balance it out. It's better than say, Blue Moon, but its not on par with an actual Belgian Wit. This beer has a bit of an unusual mouthfeel; fairly slick, kind of like some sort of petrochemical product.. it could be worse, though.

The head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a foamy cap, which still had decent size throughout consumption. The subsequent lacing was spotty and sticky. It looks good in a glass. The first whiff of the nose told me that SA got the key components of the style; it was orangey with other notes of zippy citrus, coriander with a hint of yeasty-wheat-bread at the finish. The potency is modest but plenty loud enough to understand the invitation. It is a good Wit nose; it just lacks a little panache! The palate is quite juicy; I like the citrus notes upfront. In the middle a big gush of orange follows and wipes out any other flavors for a moment. In the finish I could taste the spices, they are a bit muddled and it is hard to place the individual seasoning (maybe cloves, coriander, nutmeg?). Only in the aftertaste is the malt tasted, wheaty, dull but round and tasty. If the malty taste could start early in the beer SA would have a real winner here. As is, Id say it is a bit better than Coors Blue Moon and even Boulevards ZON. It is an Americanized Wit for the masses. The sweetness grows, I cant see quaffing too many in one setting. Still I like it, as it is tasty and refreshing. The carbonation is on the bigger side, pleasant mouthfeel, medium-light in body; all in all it works for the style.

Atop was a 1/2"" head of light white fluff. The nose was immeadiately detectable as citrus, lemon, orange. The first taste was suprisingly sweet. Ugg, it almost tasted artificially sweetened. Average motuhfeel, it seemed to be a little too heavy for white ale, but maybe more aking to big hefe. Spice flavors were stock clove and corriander, maybe cinammon or nutmeg too. This beer really got worse as I continued drinking it. It had a very ppor aftertaste about halfway through. I really was very let down by this.

The taste was pretty light but very pleasant. Probably not a ""superb"" rendition of the style, but I really enjoyed this one. It had just enough tang and zest along with the breadiness and bananna-clove spiciness to make a warming Saturday afternoon very enjoyable. This was also extremely drinkable. I'm new to the style and have not tasted the quintessential WIT's and HEFE's yet, but this hit the spot and I will be buying this again throughout the summer months.

So you might be able to imagine how excited I was to find a beer produced by this brewery that I had only read about. Here is my review which was sidelined by my subjective enthusiam, so I beseech the reader to add an impartial objectivity. Boldly stated, this was something of a disappointment. The appearence is an orange, cloudy substance that retains quite a bit of a pleasant foam that is balanced by a mediocre bouquet that can be compared to sniffing a Chimay Grande Reserve through a coffee filter. Its taste is nothing to gawk at but it is noticable that its true potnetial has been undercut by commercial imperatives. The slightly creamy mouthfeel is rounded- out nicely by the sharp interruption of its dryness. Overall this is an enjoyable specimen that either suit the likes of the Belgian White Ale amatuer or that of the aficionado that never cared much for the style whatsoever.
