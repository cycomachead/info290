The aftertaste was a nice bit of wheat and slight hops to finish, that was the good part. There was something a little too sweet that I can't place my finger on. This was good, easy drinking, extremely smooth. Just not blown away by any means. But it did taste like a wheat beer and a sessionable one.","cambabeer","Sep 09, 2014"

Taste is much the same with grain, earth, spice, yeast, and slight citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with very earthy aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 09, 2014"

With that said this was a very tasty beer and seemed like an authentic Belgian. I thought it came across more as a hybrid of a Saison / Belgian Blonde ale and not your typical witbier. Perhaps the 100 degree heat changed it. Whether it did or not, its a very solid Belgian beer and feels like 7% and not 5.5%.","bubseymour","Jun 12, 2014"

I promised the ex-Old Lady, however, that if a CAN specifically forbade this sort of treatment, then I would abide by the brewer/brewery's wishes. The Crack! unveiled a brimful CAN and so a very gentle Glug ensued. It saddened me to do business that way, especially since I only got a sheen of fizzy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated to wisps as a result. Color was a hazy lemon-yellow (SRM = 4 to 5). Nose was kind of light in terms of both orange peel and coriander. My first draught gave me a fizzy, highly carbonated mouthfeel and the taste remained muted for the style. Yes, I was getting the citrus and spice flavors, but nowhere near what I am used to from other beers in the style. Finish was semi-dry and really kind of bland overall.

Aroma is yeast, citrus peel, spice, malt. Flavor's like nose, tang in front along with some bitter, then the other qualities. As it warms more citrus peel comes out. The combination of tang and bettering agents yields a reaction on the back of the tongue that isn't that pleasant; other than that body/carbonation are decent. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, and while not bad, Ike hooegardens much more.","drpimento","Dec 10, 2013"

Tried it out of the can and then tried it poured ice cold into a pilsner glass with a slice of organic orange. It's nothing straight out of the can. However, poured over the orange slice and ice cold, it beats a Moon hands down. The color meshes with the orange in the glass. Overall, this is a very, very enjoyable ale here in the Northeast Florida heat and we'll be buying it on a regular basis.","RHWeir","Jun 10, 2013"

3.61,-1.9,3.75,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"The beer pours a straw yellow with a rocky soap bubble head that collapses into a fizzy, thick scrim. The beer’s body is cloudy but clean and free of particles with a lazy and slow stream of bubbles treading towards the top of the glass. On the nose the beer smells of sweet orange peel, cuaraco with lemon sweet bread notes and a touch of bitter grass. There is also a bready sweet note that stands apart from the lemon and reminds me of a sweet cracker, which goes nicely with the beer’s name. On the tongue the beers tastes of bready sugars and citric lemon acid. The flavor begins as sweet lemon bread, opening into grassy hops and orange peel flavors with a touch of coriander spice. The finish suggests slight green vegetal apple flavor with notes of lemon and grass, then dips into a creamy cracker flavor briefly as the beer warms, but quickly washes away, this flavor really has to be searched for though and is not abundantly clear to the palate. The aftertaste is very light and clean. From the can, the beer smells nearly the same, and tastes a little sweeter due to the concentration of flavors in the tiny can opening. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a slight wateriness. The carbonation is a little sharp on the tongue, and the mouth is left slightly sticky with nice amounts of saliva from the acid in the beer. Overall, this is a nice sessionable wit with some interesting flavors. I don’t really get the cracker flavor, but I can see what the brewers were reaching for with this beer. It’s tasty, sessionable, and worth a try. A nice middle of the road wit.","Maxwell","Apr 06, 2013"

Aroma is very average and resembles most wits and hefes I've come across. In the nose I get a lot of banana, spicy cloves, and a tinge of orange. A very "yeasty" smelling brew. Taste follows the nose exactly. Nothing else really jumps out at me. Carbonation is high, but not too high and the mouthfeel is light to medium. Overall, this is a tasty wit, but nothing new or original. To me, this brew falls in the hefe category more so than a traditional wit. I say this because that signature banana smell/taste in hefes is the predominant taste in this beer. Definitely worthy of a try, but nothing life-changing like other CC offerings.

The taste brings in more of the same, along with more zest from the orange and a twinge of lemon zest for good measure. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little wit, something I could easily see drinking plenty of were I down in the Sunshine State's climate.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2012"

4.21,14.4,5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy gold color with a two finger head into my bruery tulip with intense lacing. Aroma of hops, spices(especially coriander) and orange. Taste follows the nose, lightly sweet but not overdone, bitterness of hops balances. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a little too carbonated but not crazy. I love this beer, it's the best representation of the style to me.","jcartamdg","Sep 14, 2011"

3.2,-13,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"O-i always expect a lot from CCB so this beer lets me down. its fairly harsh for a witbier. it actually reminds me of the harshness of many wits from Belgium. this style should the kind you want to drink large amounts of all night long, but this just isn't the case here.","AdamBear","Aug 27, 2011"
4.05,10.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: Very nice beer for the Florida heat. The peppery notes add flavor without taking away from the refreshing nature of the beer.","kylehay2004","Jul 10, 2011"

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"The aroma started out very light. Nice touches of light malts, grains, with a touch of light fruit mixed in. Very floral with a light earthy tone to it and a really nice touch of coriander or orange peel way in the back. The flavor was more of the same, very light, with a very well carbonated and airy feel to it. Started out with a good bit of light grain, and started to mix in some light fruit and touches of orange and lemon as you go. Nice light earthy flavor in the middle, like flower petals, or light heather almost. Clean taste, with a quick finish that really just gets started before it dries out enough that that you are going back in for another one","mikesgroove","Jun 11, 2011"
3.82,3.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Medium body and effervescence with a slightly drying aspect. Nice lingering aftertaste though. I like this brew. Probably the lightest one of CCB's I've had to date but just as good as the reputation would lead you to believe.","PorterLambic","May 29, 2011"
3.23,-12.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it poured a slightly hazy, pale gold color with no head. The nose is very muted, with floral (juniper?) smells, and very light spicing. The beer is light and smooth, with flavors of slight sour citrus and a smooth, bready spicing. Light in mouth, this beer has an aftertaste that is mostly coriander spicing. The finish is minimal and quick, making an easy drinker.","GarthDanielson","May 23, 2011"
4.09,11.1,3,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: Very good summer brew. I could drink quite a lot of this in the hot summer days here in FLA. I hope this one makes it way back on in the future. Skal.","Gtreid","May 18, 2011"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a murky light amber with two fingers of white foam, settles leaving wispy rings of lace along the way. Smell: spicy and slightly citric with light fruit esters, lightly toasted. Taste: pale sweetness, wheat cracker, a little sweet caramel, quite spicy, lemon, notes of clove and greenish banana. Light-medium bodied, active carbonation, spicy and mineral finish. More than your usual wit; amped up all around, except for the abv. From growler filled 5/21.","babaracas","Beers"
