"Not my cup of tea. Belgian yeasty flavored beer. I'm an IPA guy who can veer a little for other good brews, but not for this. Pass."
"Not a fan of pepper beers so this one was just too much.  The peppers made it seem like a mess of muddled flavors."
""
""
"Overall, worth trying!"
""
"750 ml bottle poured into pint glass. Thin head. Spicy fruity aroma. Apple cider, spicy/peppery, cracker, dry finish."
""
""
""
"As a cider this was okay. As an experimental wit this was a miss."
""
"Dry, tart, didn't taste what was advertised"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the biggest waste of money I think I've made yet on beer. NONE of the Flavors promised on the label are in this beers taste, aroma maybe, but it tastes like a sweetened, weak Duvel. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! WOULD GIVE A ZERO IF I COULD!"
""
""
"Tasty saison-like beer w/a noticeable cider peel smell.  Pleasant combination of spice (coriander everywhere) and lingering apple sweetness with clean, medium-dry finish.  This would be lovely with a stinky- soft cheese (brie, soft blue, goat...)."
"I loved this beer. It tasted a lot like a saison to me. Really light & crisp. Very easy to drink considering the alcohol content. It's a really good summertime beer."
"3.66/5.00"
""
""
""
"Bottled in 2012. A nice subtle heat on the tail end from the cayenne."

"Lightly hazy golden color with a minimal head. Spicy earthy fruity flavors with a Belgianesque character. I'm surprised how little of the ingredients I found in my sample, but I was at a brew fest. I must try this beer again."

"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a medium size white foamy head with medium retention and some lacing. Aroma of apple cider with some coriander notes is quite refreshing. Aroma of cider is quite dominant with some medium sweet notes. Coriander notes are also noticeable and are well-balanced against the sweeter malt base. Body is light with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very nice experiment and I could see myself drinking this again on hot summer days."
""
""
"O: 3.5 - ""witbier""? There's not a thing in here that resembles any wit I've ever had. I guess they just needed someplace to stick it. It's a complex beer, but it's not very drinkable, and I can't imagine ever wanting to try this again."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy golden color. There was a thin white head that doesn’t linger or leave much lacing. It has a nice nose. Some apple, spicy and earthy. The taste is very good. It has a touch of bitterness, earthy, apple and spices. Nice!"

"Pours a very pale yellow, almost throughs a tinge of chartreuse into things. Actually, coincidentally enough (ok, it’s just my willful belief) it’s almost hte same colour as the album cover (in the year 3030...). Finger and a half of white driven snow fades soon enough. You really get the cider on the nose. It’s sweet and crisp up front. Round pears and a bit of Belgian yeast. Minor light spices, not picking up much depth behind that. The cider takes front court again, spicy Belgian yeast brings pear to the party, and the Belgian spice segues nicely into the light cayenne heat at the end. The finish is surprisingly earthy and bitter; a characteristic that was not necessarily present earlier in the profile. Dunno if the cilantro and farro could be contributing to the earthiness, or if I’m just making hte connection because I was looking for them since I’d read the description, but at the very least it’s not completely without the realm of believability."

"Rich golden color with excellent clarity. There's an inch of tightly knit bright white foam and some light Brussels lacing. I get a lot of spices within the aroma but I think the cilantro and cider stand out the most. The flavor is powerfully spiced and you really get the cilantro which is a bit refreshing and gives it a vegetal edge. The cider gives a light sweetness. The cayenne gives a slight warmth and and the cider offers some dryness in the mouth."

"An interesting beer. The apple is balanced - not powerful, but enough to give it character. Sweet, but the hint of spicing balances it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a mostly clear, golden yellow color with a slight foamy head. There is a decent amount of wheat, citrus, and banana in the aroma among other hints. The taste is an interesting take on the Belgian Wit beer as you get the bold yeasty, banana taste but an interesting group of spices. Don’t let the cilantro or dried cayenne pepper turn you off as you wouldn't even know those ingredients were in there."

"A very interesting beer. The appearance was hazy yellow with a thin fizzy head. The smell was mostly apples with a little bit of herb. The taste is mostly apple, but there's a lot of great subtle flavors. Earthy herbs and a nice medley of spices mixes with the citrus hops and makes a very interesting flavor. I like the finish, very clean and refreshing. If you're a fan of spiced beers and ciders, this is probably a great fit for you."
"O- The depth of this beer is great. Many layers of flavors, and feels. Its fresh and wet, and then there's the bite and heat in the finish. Also, this will sneak up on you. So easy to drink for a 9%, and unexpected for a Witbier."
""
""

"Overall a tasty concoction. Lacks any trace of most of the ingredients however."

"O: A well-crafted beer, each flavor was distinct and pretty clear, although that earthy minerality/chalkiness took away from it somewhat. I'm surprised this one worked, the ingredients are pretty diverse, but somehow melded well. A good novelty tasting."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall not a bad beer, I had this on tap at the Dogfish Brewery, a simple beer with high abv."
""

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good stronger representation of style, this is a solid flavorful beer to drink for a while."

"This is a fantastic beer. Try it, buy more, and pray they start bottling this in six-packs because this is incredibly drinkable."

"very interesting beer, somewhat of a beer and cider hybrid, which isn't as common as it maybe should be. fuji is a great choice of apple to go with this strong blonde ale. clean looking, with a soapy inch of white head. it smells interesting, more apple heavy than anything, and i honestly don't get any cayenne pepper. maybe a little bit of spices, but more cider type than heat type for me. the taste is similarly apple driven without being sweet. i mean, its still beer first, no doubt, which i appreciate, but its most flavorful adjunct is by far the apples. juicy and fresh, this takes me to fall, with a pronounced spice finish, but again, hard to place it as cayenne at all, which i also don't particularly mind. the feel is the best feature. its so creamy, like it came from a nitro tap, its full bodied, but almost puffy on my palate, and it swallows clean. amazing. also surprisingly well hidden abv. another weirdo beer from dogfish, but this one is far more successful than others. really top quality stuff, and i can't imagine a beer/cider fusion coming out any better than this one."

"This is a fine, relaxing beer to be enjoyed with friends and hearty laughter during a hot summer afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent look upon first pour. Smell is very similar to a hard cider. Taste is very crisp and cider like as well but than followed by a punch of yeast, maybe even the slightest bit sour at the end. Still very light and drinkable for a beer of 9% ABV. Dogfish can hide their alcohol well - much like a ""designated driver."""

"Food meets beer. Literally, but no chewing required. Brewed with Dan the Automator (Deltron 3030) using Fuji cider, slow-roasted farro, cayenne and fresh cilantro, and fermented with a Belgian yeast strain. Except for being bit too sweet, this is an incredible display of collaboration and creativity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This unusual, creative beer is a success, with a nicely crafted use of cilantro, apple cider, cayenne pepper and other unusual beer ingrediants producing a complex, interesting, fruity and distinctive blend that is well balanced (given the goal of creating a cider/beer hybrid) and still lets the underlying Belgian Wit character shine thru. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall nice gentle flow of flavors and complexity. Abv% of 9.0 is very nicely hidden. Very smooth and polished drinking experinece. Again another dfh beer that is hard to define and squeeze into a confined style parameter but tasty within itself."
""
""
""
"O- Glad I had this on tap, most of these big bottle DFH brews are just too hit or miss for me to shell out about 15 bucks only to find out I hate it. I could see purchasing this again so long as I've got a buddy to split it with. This is the second beer with hot pepper in it that I've had and still not sure that it's for me. I really enjoyed apple and Belgian yeast combo though, maybe DFH should break into the cider business."
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
"Overall: PC is a beverage that desperately needs to be paired with food. Me, I was fairly neutral about this contact."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A big, complex beer that is somewhere between a saison and a wit or grand cru. Despite it's heft and obvious alcohol, it is drinkable and keeps you wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am a fan of witbiers, but there was not much that would make me want to buy this one again. Boulevard's Two Jokers is the domestic standard bearer for this style in my eyes. Positive contact can't measure up to Two Jokers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is beer is definitely worth a try. It really helps define DFH's slogan of ""off-centered ales for off-centered people."" This beer is anything but normal, and very hard to categorize."

"Pours a big, airy head, well over three fingers, bleached white, dissolves at a speedy clip, very little stickiness so not much lacing appearing. Transparent with a dilute yellow to orange coloration, quite a few fat and lazy bubbles rising within, looks as much as a cider as a beer. The nose is both crisp and sweet, the apples come through as well as cinnamon spice, there is a leafy spiciness but not sure I’d peg it as cilantro, some orange zest and peach to apricot fruit too, yeast and pie dough, no hops of note, has very good staying power which is pleasing in place of the missing complexity. Full-bodied, super creamy and coats the entire mouth. The carbonation is all fluffiness, no cleansing aspect. The apples supported by banana, peach, pear and that same cinnamon, nutmeg spice. The cayenne comes through as an afterthought, muted. Even the flavors are sweet the texture gets dry by the finish so any yeastiness becomes truncated. More enjoyable colder, not that it gets flabby as it warms but the components start to blur. No problem throwing it back but leaves you with little desire for a second or third glass."

""

"Overall: Unique. Easy to drink and refreshing, but also surprisingly complex."
""
""
"Overall I was impressed with this beer for how tasty the flavors were and how well the ABV was hidden. Wish the bottles were not so expensive I would have grabbed a few."
"Overall - pricey but a tasty bottle. Very easy to drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty take on a strong wit beer/cider hybrid. Rather refreshing and a good one to give a try to."
"Overall: This is one of the Dogfish ""misses"" for me; really don't care for what the cilantro brings - normally I like cilantro but I am certainly not picking it up in this beer"

"Color was a golden amber, almost like a apple juice. A few small streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. The head was a 1 finger fluffy white that only last 2 or 3 minutes. Initially poured similar to a sparkling apple cider. Aroma was like a sweet apple cider. Not as sweet as a juice, but the apples were definitely noticeable. A small bit of banana in the back as well. Flavor was sweet, but still a bit dry. A little bit of peppery yeast as well. Coated nicely. Not overly stickey or chewy. Not as much carbonation as I would expect on the style notes. Overall a unique beer. Not necessarily true to style notes, but well balanced with a very unique flavor."
""
""
""
"O - I think it's a pretty well executed beer considering the components, however not a beer I would add to the list to remember, skip the cilantro and I would try again ( usually hate the taste unless the peppers have enough heat to overpower it)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice example of what can be done to make a witbier stand out. Its not my favortie but it certainly stands out. The 9% is well-hidden and its very tasty. The price is a little high but it certainly wouldn't be an all-the-time beer for me. Give it a shot"
""
""
""
"D - Dogfish is known for the ""off centered"" ales and fearless experimentation... This one may be the most ""out there"" and it comes with surprising results... While this is not something I would drink with regularity, it really is something that anyone looking to challenge their palate and experience something should check out... A Witbier + Cider + Cayenne Pepper = WTF??? But you know what, it oddly works and makes for a refreshing and enjoyable brew..."
"All in all a great beer. May be too much going on to really get it all, but I like it."

"Dogfish Head Positive Contact ---4/5."
""
"I really like this beer- in fact, I'm surprised by how much I like this beer. I was pretty sure that the cider addition was going to be over done and it would be too tart and thin, or it would be over spiced and taste like potpourri. Luckily, you don't get either of those. What you do get is a perfectly balanced beer with a lot of apple flavor, but not sourness, a noticeable hint of bubblegum (particularly in the aroma), a rich nuttiness- which I'd assume is from the farro, and a substantial body. Very nice."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a dryer malt, and almost pils like. In the taste, a dry fruitiness, with a small dry nuttiness. A small hop like bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Decent, fruity and quite lager like."

"A pretty imperial witbier and a lot better than I thought it would be. I think that Dogfish head did a great job with this beer and will probably get another one."
"Pours a two finger head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber/straw color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Spicy yeast nose, flavor is spicy and herbs, not tasting any cayenne but late sweetness from the Fuji apples. $14.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
""
"Definitely not the worst beer DFH has ever churned out. Surprisingly complex, but it missed the mark a little, and ended up too sweet/close to cider. The yeast helped a bit, but just seemed to muddle things a bit."

"O: I'm not really sure what the appropriate drinking situation is...It's super-refreshing, but also quite strong. Proceed with caution."
"This pours a yellowish orange with a nice white head. Kind of lighter than a cider and darker than a whitbier. The smell is nothing remarkable. Reminds me a little of a farmhouse ale and a little like a Belgium strong. The taste was also a lot more ordinary than I was expecting. I really pick up no cilantro or cheyann or really not a whole heck of a lot of cider either. It does have a Belgium spice to it with a nice finish but was hoping for a lot more. Most disappointed in the missing cheyann since I was wishing this would have a little bit to it. Overall, very drinkable and clean. Not what I was expecting at all though. Just another me too kind of beer. Still love Dogfish Head though."
"O: A fine cider offering from DFH. If you're interested in something sweet, spicy, and hot, this is one for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting beer; a complex mix of fruit, bitterness and spice, very enjoyable at first but turning heavy and cloying as it warmed. While it was not my favorite witbier, I found it complex and challenging and worth trying to find a bottle."
"O: Solid, enjoyable, but won't necessarily be memorable. Hides its 9% abv very well"
""
""
"A tempest of bubbles violently race to the top of the glass, contributing to a crown-like white head. This is a pretty beer. The smell is enticing...sweetness...blossoms and yeast, a but of malt, candy, and spice. Wit-like, but powerful and perfume. The taste is complex, sweet, warming, and spicy. Fruit is very present, but I don't know if I would have identified cider. Exceptional smoothness, and just a touch of warmth. Exceptional."
""
""
"O: A very good beer that is an interesting take on the witbier style. pick it up."
""
""
"Pours straw yellow, pretty clear with a two finger bubbly head. Smell is amazing begian wheat, sweet slight malt. The taste is also starts with predominant Belgian yeast, plenty of apple, but not in a sweet way. The cayenne is also pleaseny present at the end. The after taste is dry cinnamon apple. This beer isn't as sweet as I expected and the texture was thicker than I figured it would be. This is a great dinner beer, but you'd be understandably deceived if you wanted to sip this on a 90 degree day. Reminded me a lot of a more complex, fruitier, slightly lighter, version of Birra Etrusca"
"On tap at Easy Tiger in Austin. Honestly a bit pricey for a Dogfish beer, but it turned out nicely. Poured in a wine glass golden with a small head. Big pear and apple aroma with some funky yeast and spice. Sweet honey pear flavor with prickly carbonation and a crisp finish. Medium-light bodied and easy to drink. A nice beer."
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is fruity and spicy, the brew smells like apples (sweet and tart), peppery spice, bananas, straw, grainy malt, pears, and cilantro. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also grape, cloves and some very light cayenne noticeable. The aroma and taste reminds me more of a Tripel because of the fruit and yeast. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this brew easy to drink. Also, the 9% ABV is well hidden. I think it's a good overall brew, definitely worth a try."
""
""
"M: Spry, medium-bodied, crisp."
""
""
""
"Shit, I was worried I'd never see this stuff, then BAM! here it is on-tap at Nellie's. It pours a lightly-hazy brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises honey, cranberry, white grape, chili pepper, and apples. There's a fairly random mixture for ya, eh? At least it's good... The taste brings in more of the same, though with more white grape, the pepper has taken on more of a curry/cumin character, and some flowers enter the picture for the sake of it. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda gel-like feel. Overall, a decidedly interesting beer, one that showcases the versatility of apples in brewing and the possibilities of sheer randomness."
"Poured a clearish gold body with two finger head that slowly receeds and left plenty of lace. I pick up citric notes and yeast as well as some peppery spice, but also get some type of apple like sweetness which I guess is the cider and there is a slight sweet malt aroma as well. This kind of reminded me less of a wit and more of a Belgian Pale only because the citric twang and spicey zip I associate with those brews is not as pronounced as one would normally find in a wit. They are in there, but there's also some plush juicy and tropical fruit notes and some sugary malt sweetness as well. Beer is light-to-medium bodied, creamy at times and sharp at others thanks to carbonation and the ABV is well-hidden."
""
"Low B-"
"Raul's brother ordered this not knowing what it was (he poured half out to me) and I sure wish that he didn't. Raul's like, yeah, he gets it, but like a floozy wearing wedges, he wishes that he didn't (get it, that is). It's palatable, and like a girl in wedges, he won't turn it away. But also like said hoochie, Raul wishes that this beer could just put some stilettos on."

"Very intense for a wit, couldn't drink more than a glass. Still, very well crafted and flavorful. Apple flavor comes off differently than expected, not as cider-y as one would think... Just wish there was less alcohol for a more enjoyable summer sipper."
"smells of apples cinnamon, lemon peel, little golden color, creamy mouthfeel,with with nice carbonation that fades quickly small bubbles, no lacing, some we wheatyness.with orange, pepper, and a mild sweet aftertaste. Overall an Imperial saison style with a nice mouth feel and a small uniqueness.cool but not over interesting."

"Hazy gold color with a small, creamy looking head. Aromas of pear and apple joined by floral, herbal, spicy qualities. Spicy, estery fruit. Sweet, yeasty flavors of apple, herbs, dried banana, flowers, pepper, coriander, and clove. A little more ""hefe"" than ""wit"". A little heat in the throat and smooth bodied. An interesting experience, but it's one and done for me."

"Overall: Coming into this brew, I would say I had some doubts, considering I've recently had bad experiences with Dogfish Head's rotating, specialty beers. But I was taken aghast. This beer actually was quite delicious. The witbier category is well represented. A mix of the wheat and bitter of the spices and even the cider is added with a slight bitterness works well. It's well-balanced. The body is quite nicely put together. I would totally have this beer again and would recommend it to a friend. Cheers!"

"Beautiful golden ale brought forth from a cider base of pressed Fuji apples, cilantro, cayenne, and roasted faro. Hazed just slightly glowing golden body with a bright white head, forms fine lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has tart apples freshly sliced in the forefront with hints of herbal spice with a peppery cayenne kick in the nares....really complex well brewed offering from one of my favorite brewers and rappers Dan the Automator aka Deltron 3030 aka Del the Funky Homosapien. No overt sweetness on the palate just tasty sliced apples, spicy cayenne and cilantro interplay, a nice mix of flavors bready yeast biscuit malt and cracker dough added to the spectrum. Nares are lightly kissed with the spice additions of the cayenne and cilantro, a really well done carbonation level effervescent fine ale carries the beer just right across my palate. It works really well for me, the type of beer I can drink by myself, with friends, or with food it's a triple threat great tasting complex and drinkable you can't hate on that. Toward the end I paired it with a spicy Nicaraguan cigar Ortega Wild Bunch series #4 Tony the Boss Churchill great spicy smoke leather in the tobacco pairs well with the spice and light apple sweetness, I'm diggin' the combo it works together so nicely."

"A good beer for the Spring time"
"This would be the recent batch #2. Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright yellow-gold coloring and a fluffy, white, tall, bright head that leaves a cling all over the glass as it slowly recedes. Settles in a solid half an inch. Aromas of all spice, cinnamon, subtle apple sweetness, and a touch of cloves. Flavors are smooth and light, with a cider sweet backbone and subtle pepper spicing. Very light and very well balanced. The all spice and clove become highlighting accents instead of main characteristics. Very light, crisp, clean body. The finish is slightly sweet, with a hint of spice. Great balance to a very unique brew. Tasty, light, and hugely refreshing."

"Overall: yes, I think the overall warrants a higher than any individual score. The experimentation warrants. Kudos to Dogfish and keep at it!"
""
""
"Hazy, pale yellow pour, with a large cap of foamy white head that receded to a ringlet, leaving a few dots of lacing on the glass. Fairly typical wheat profile on the nose, with notes of apple and grape. Taste of toasted wheat, sweet apple cider, subtle grape and yeast flavors, herbal hops; I didn't really get any pepper characteristics at all. Light-medium body, decent overall, but not too memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"The most notable thing here is the spicy finish. It's warm and complements the lighter flavor of the rest of the beer very well. It's flavorful, but doesn't go out of it's way to be an experience outside of the transition from the light fruit hints to the spice at the finish. All in all a good one trick beer that I would drink again any time. Good for all occassions."

"Another off-centered-ale from DFH."

"O: Considering its strength, this beer is rather easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"O: This beer is refreshing and easy to drink like others in the style, but the imperial nature of it makes the hidden alcohol all the more impressive. There is just a hint of hefeweizen, likely due to the yeast which contributes the very light notes of banana/cove."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"D - Not bad, it is a bit much at first but grows on me as I drink it and halfway through the glass it has become a spicy, fairly complex Belgian golden type beer."
"Overall: definitely weird as expected. Reminded me a lot of cheap, packaged fruit cocktail with Belgian character. Glad stores decided to brake these 6 packs up despite the threats."
"Clear orange, white head with ok retention and some lacing. Nose has lots of wheat, green banana, some cider character and orange rind. Cayenne is super subtle, wouldn't have picked it out had it not been on the label. Taste has banana, wheat, spice on the back. Toasty malts and a bit of alcohol in the finish. Some texture on the palate, medium body. Good enough as an imperial wit, but as with most of these DFH collab beers, I struggle to pick out any of these crazy ingredients."

"Bitter ending, nice carbonation."

"I expected to get more from the cayenne and cilantro but might not have because of the beer's age."
""

"o: i think i like this better now than when i had a sample of it fresh. cilantro is gone and the spices have blended with the cider to make this a smoother easier to drink beer."

"Taste is quite cidery with a mild yeasty wheat bite at the end. The pepper is pretty tame and I wouldnt have noticed it if I didnt know it was there...the cilantro is a bit of an enigma, as the flavors are incorporated nicely and I do get a bit of vegetal stem-y-ness. The coriander is omnipresent and is about the only thing holding this beer withinthe witbier category. Alcohol is a bit high and overall the beer is just kind of fruity/cidery. The flavors are pretty well integrated thoough and is an interesting pour. I am not a fan of the double-wit style, so take that for what its worth."

"O: If this was cheaper I would buy this again, it's a truely interesting and tasty experiment by dogfish head but the price is quite high. It throws a couple of strange ingredients together and manages to balance them well and get the flavors they wanted out of them."
""
"There's a room at Dogfish Head where they roll the big dice. Comin' up cilantro! Apples! Cayenne! It is some kind of fruit punch mixed with V-8 juice from the 30th century, but I have to admit it is very tasty and intriguing. Once of the better DF concoctions."

"Hazy pale gold with some floaters in the glass along with huge white head and tons of lace, I'm not a huge fan of the yeast which even a slow pour wouldn't leave in the bottle. The smell is quite typical of a good/great Belgian golden ale with the peppery spiciness which is backed by lemon and clean wheat bready character. The additions of cider, cilantro and cayenne may be just noticeable in the smell but they are subtle. The taste too is all Belgian ale with some additions. First you are hit by lemon and pepper. This is followed by great pale malt, biscuit and warming alcohol characteristics. The cider adds to the complexity of the fruity esters of the yeast and maybe it is just because I've read the label and I'm looking for it but it does seem as though the pepper and cilantro are also evident but only just and again to add an additional layer of complexity to a beer that is already quite impressive. The carbonation is relatively high and the peppery tingle makes this beer quite lively in the mouth. Overall this is a great twist on a great style using some interesting ingredients proving again that the guys and DFH have redefined what brewing and beer can be."
"O - Overall this wasn't a bad beer with nice witbier aspects. The cayenne doesn't really work with this beet though."
"bit of alcohol heat but its pretty well hidden for such a strong wit."
""
"Don't buy again"
""
"O: Looks good, smells good, tastes good and drinks easy. not your average witbier and a nice twist on the style. good balance of flavors with a nice complexity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good enough, but lacks the follow-through you might expect from the description. At times it drinks more like a Belgian pale than a witbier."
"O: This was an interested beer that was just right for a cool fall afternoon. It had many cider-like qualities from the light body and apple sweetness; and, the slight Belgian yeast funk and the touch of spice added a nice twist. This was definitely a different and “off-center” beer. It is not a “must try” but it is still pretty darn good."
"Overall: pretty solid for a witbier. It could be a tripel, but still tasty one way or another."
"OVERALL: A nice addition to the Dogfish Head lineup, this has an ancient ale feel, but mostly, its just a tasty beverage and definitely remains a beer."

"Pours an almost-clear golden color with a medium white head. Some floaties floating around in there as well. Scent is verry apple-forward. Some lovely fuji apple aromas with Belgian yeast and pears...a little white grape as well. I'm detecting a lot of spices, but not necessarily cayenne in the nose. Not really getting any cilantro either. It does smell inviting though. Taste is quite complex, much better than I was expecting. Initially, I get a pleasant herbal flavor, immediately followed by floral Belgian notes. Yeasty belgian deliciousness with a TON off Fuji apples and a hint of cinnamon. The cayenne peppers make their appearance mid-palate, but VERY subtle. There is a hint of booziness, but nothing you would expect from a 9% ""witbier"". Unfortunately, still not detecting any cilantro. Some more light fruit flavors...pears, green apples, white grapes. Sweet Belgian-yeast finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and somewhat refreshing. Drinkability is high. Overall, I am VERY shocked by this beer. I went into this thinking it was simply a gimmick and would not taste good. I only bought it because I am a fan of Deltron 3030. Glad I bought it...very tasty."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grape, apple, pear, pepper, clove, banana, bubblegum, cilantro, herbal, light cayenne, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of apple, grape, pear, cilantro, clove, banana, pepper, herbal, earth, grass, bubblegum, wheat, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruit, banana, pepper, clove, herbal, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with nice complimenting flavors from the herbs and spices. Nothing is overbearing. No cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial witbier! Fantastic complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on. This was very impressive."
""
"Appearance is golden with a nice creamy head that leaves good lacing on the glass. The smell on this beer is really nice - heavy apple scent and spices along with some bready malts make this a very nice fall beer. The taste is also sweet with apples and peppery spices. Smooth on the front end; on the back end there is a pop of fruit flavor maybe enhanced by cayenne on the tongue (although cayenne not specifically notable). Great brew."
""
"This is NOT your typical summer wheat beer. So much more complex, with a nice heat in the finish that works well around an Autumn campfire."

"Drinking this with my corn dog Amanda! Pours up a nice golden orange with a solid white crown. Nice lacing. This is the way a beer should look. I smell apple up front. Very sweet apples. A lil lemon, some yeast, maybe a banana ester. Taste apples, big and bold. Mayyyybe a kiss of cayenne kick up front, mayyyybe a mellow herbal finish. Wheaty and Belgium-esque fo shozy. I wish I could taste all the other ingrediates as prodominant as the apples. Regardless, tasty wit bier and you can never go wrong with 9% booze"

"Overall, a really enjoyable imperial wit for a change. Goes down dangerously smooth for 9%. I really liked it as a nice change of pace after a recent run of heavy hopped ADIPA's. High recommend and another good outing from Dogfish. Available here in TX. Rotation: I can see getting several bottles per year. It's says it's a rotating release so not sure how often it will be available. Tap for sure. Might be a good beer to share with craft newbies as well."
""
""
"O: When I saw this beer, I was completely unaware it was a part of Dogfish Head's music-inspired series; I simply picked up the beer because it seemed like an interesting list of ingredients. Although skeptical of the cider/cilantro mix, I will say that it worked in a rather pleasing fashion. DFH did a good job making the ingredients of this beer work together which made for a interesting deviation from the norm. I enjoyed the experience but at $10 a bomber, this was definitely a one time thing."

"O: If this beer were only a few bucks, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat. However, at $10, please choose your future beers wisely..."

"M -Medium body with a slight chew. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Shared by myself during BRoss242’s send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured neon yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, apple cider, wheat, grain, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, apple, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Apple cider in a beer… Hmmm, this is a big bottle of Woodchuck. Wait, shit! This isn’t my Woodchuck Cider! But seriously, I’m not really sure how I feel about this one, but the rest of the beer helped to carry it through as a decent representative for the style. Not sure if I would drink this one again though and I really feel sorry for those who bought a case of these unless you only wanted the vinyl collection."
"O - I was really impressed by this beer. I do get the Fuji apple cider, but the cayenne and cilantro are really hidden. Still makes for a crazy delicious and refreshing beer. Call me crazy, but a six pack of these along with some awesome music sounds perfect."
""
""
""
"An interesting beer, the different ingredients come together quite nicely."
""
""
"O - If you like Belgian yeast and the like, you'll love this beer on a hot day. A nice lemon flavor added to it to make a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The addition of cider to this beer doesn't do too much to change it, which I like. DFH usually does a nice job imparting the flavor of a different type of drink while maintaining the integrity of the base beer (also in cases such as red & white and noble rot with the wine characteristics), and that stays true here. I really like the complexity and depth as well. Nice job"
""

"O: This is a very good beer. The flavors is very delicious and blows me away."

"Clear amber/gold color with a bubbly pale yellow head. Lots of yeast, wheat and orange falvors on the nose, herbal tea and some spice also. Bubbly, light apple cider with a heavy yeast character onn the first sip. Creamy malt, wheat and rolled oats with orange and lemon zest. Solid finish with lots of dense malt character. Medium body with medium carbonation."
""
""
""

"Positive Contact is an interesting beer. I’ve come to expect no less from Dogfish Head. It’s good beer, but it’s not great beer. The alcohol flavor comes through a little too strong and it just seems too big for the style. Definitely worth checking out though."

"Pours a crisp lightclear golden with good foamy head; although it is gone quick, leaving a thin ring of head. Smell is really refreshing belgian meets german hefe. Banana, clove, and fruity apple aromas. Taste is really nice banana and clove again...the fruit is subtle but present and leaves a bit of heat from the cayenne pepper in the finish. Its refreshing and easy. Overall its a great brew and deff worth seeking out, especially if you are a wit fan; although I dont think id ever buy it as they intend; a six pack of bombers for ~%70...I got mine ""illegally"" as a solo bottle."
"Overall this was a nice beer, but I feel the heft/ABV hindered the enjoyability and drinkability of this beer. Beers of this style aren't meant to be this viscous and heavy on the palate. Drinks more like a Wheat Wine than a Witbier. Regardless I was glad to sample on draft over having to take the plunge and consume a whole 750ml."
""
"O: pretty intersting beer overall and was tasty as well. I thought it was worth the try."
"The overall effortless in drinkability of this imperial witbier is remarkably clean, refreshing and crisp despite its high alcohol values and the seemingly challenged spices and fruit added to the brew. But the premiere restraint of these additions give the finished beer added layers of complexity without disrupting the balance of the witbiers that we know and love. Those additions inform the usual taste but without quite being able to pinpoint its source. Putting those additions on the label takes much of the fun out of it for me."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass, in 2012. This pours a slightly hazy, light golden color with a massive tight bubbled white head which has good retention and a slight lacing. The smells are of Belgian yeast esters, some banana, apple, coriander. The feel is medium decent carbonation. The taste is different, some apple, pepper, coriander, spices."
""
"Well i was expecting more of a cider, not an average wheat beer. Love the color and fast rising bubbles. The was acutally head rentention. I was like thats amazing for a cider. Aromas were weak. Some fruit aromas and some earthy spice. The taste was disappointing. Cilantro added to the bitterness, zero sweetness and no to little apple flavor. Loved the cayenne kick. Well balanced heat. But the body and flavor of the base beer was weak and the cider aspect just wasnt there. This was nice paired up with some fish and veggies but not my favorite dfh brew. I guess expectations can ruin your thught process. I was expecting a spicy cider."
""
""
""
"Overall, a complex brew, but I was surprised the cider character wasn't more prevalent. Definitely worth a try!"
""
""
""
"O: A very complex and fun beer to drink. Like many a DFH ancient golden ale, I immediately though ""Midas Touch"" when I initially saw, smelled and tasted Positive Contact. However, this 9% ABV hybrid combines the refreshing tartness of a cider with the complexity of an imperial wit."
""

"Slightly cloudy golden straw color with a white head. Aroma has a nice Belgian character to it of banana, mild coriander spiciness, and yeast. Fruity apple character with a touch of grass and white pepper. The coriander and yeast are more pronounced on the palate. Light apple flavor, decently fruity. Banana, a bit of grass, bread, and a light herbaceous quality. Not bad, but kind of watery."
""
""
"O: This isn't half–bad, but don't know that I'd necessarily do another."
"4.0 D: Another winner from DFH, though like most of their offerings, this is too expensive to justify another purchase. Definitely worth a try though."

"An interesting and original beer from Dogfish Head. Personally, fruit/vegetable beer would be a better style because this doesn't quite work as a witbier."
"O - Yeasty and spicy. Hard to pickup any specific flavors."

"O: A nice sipping beer @ 9 % alcohol by volume. Very tasty and easy to drink."

"O: A nice beer, I wish the cider had more effect aka New Glarus Apple Ale. But this is certainly a nice beer. The cost is a problem, but I did enjoy this effort."
"Had on tap at Boulvard's in Johnstown, PA in a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy amber color, fruity nose to it. It is essentially a high powered Heffe. Medium bodied, nice mouthfeel. Actually don't get too much of a cider taste at all, but just a well balanced tasty brew with an assortment of fruity flavors and hops. Surprisingly smooth, finishes clean... was pleasantly surprised at how good this beer was... try it out if you can."
""
"bottle"
""
"It's innovative, experimental, and a redefinition of a spiced Wit, yet remains somewhat familiar with it's cider qualities and is a great drink."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GRABBING!"
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Surprisingly well balanced and the combination of witbier and cider works nicely."
"Overall not bad, interesting flavors but a bit too much going on. The hint of cayenne at the back is a nice touch, but with so much else going on none of it really seems to go together perfectly either."
"Drinkability: One of the stand out beers in DFH's portfolio. The best of the music inspired series since ""Bitches Brew"". This beer is really enjoyable because of how at one minute you taste those fruity, cider properties.. then all of a sudden you get that peppery, yeasty beer quality to bring you back down to the ground. Outside of the box is a understatement for this beer, and I also liked that Sam toned down the sweetness on this to make it more drinkable without too much alcohol burn in the finish. Excellent beer all around!"
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spices, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a very fruity flavor and the spice flavors coming through more on the aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice fresh aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."
"Overall, I can't say I'm really enjoying this beer. It's not awful or anything, but there's no reason I would buy another bottle. I just don't think all the elements are working together."
""
"So, am I really going to do this? Yeah. I'm knocking a Dogfish brew for being too standard. Way too standard, actually. Reading the label got my excited. Apple cider? Cilantro? Cayanne pepper? This is going to be a blast! Instead, it's just a slightly fruity witbier with a tiny bit of pepper heat on the finish. Gotta say, I expected more from this one. It's still a good beer, but come into it expecting a pretty standard Witbier. It's not nearly as crazy as you might expect from reading the label, there's only a touch of Dogfish weirdness here."
"O-A decent beer, one of the few with Apples I've enjoyed. Although the case with the vinyl was a silly idea, glad I was able to pick up a single."
""
"T: Opens with a lot of spicy malt flavor. Cinnamon, Belgian yeast, clove and some faint apple cider with a drying finish of white pepper, faint cayenne heat and some golden delicious apple skins. Mouthfeel is smooth and shows just a hint of the ABV. Nicely done."
""
""
"Very drinkable, careful now! So many layers to this brew, you think you've tasted it all until you take your next sip and then it peels away another flavor or goes back to one you tasted on your first sip. A lot of fun drinking this beer. Thanks DFH!!"
""
""
""
"NOTE: The cayenne heat crept up a lot later. It made my stomach warm up a lot, but not uncomfortably. My only real wish is slightly more apple taste (even though I know they stepped it up) and considerably more cilantro taste (but not enough to be overpowering). Overall though it was very good."
"Overall I would recommend this as a summer beer and I would pick up a second bottle if it wasn't soo limited."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Another good release from DFH. It's something I could enjoy a whole bottle, if I see another I'll probably pick one up."
""
"I guess I can taste some of the apples but not the cilantro or the chayenne pepper. It tastes like a witbier and a grainy witbier at that. not a favorite. Not a repeat."
"9% witbiers are never my idea of a good time, especially the ones that Dogfish Head puts out, but Positive Contact is lovely. Complex and versatile and boundary-crossing. This beer can be enjoyed by many."
"O: This beer is pretty much as advertised. A apple cider/beer combo. It's pretty good, but I don't know if I would seek this beer out. It's definitely fun to have tried."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal glass. Pours golden amber with two finger fine white head with excellent retention and massive lacing. Aroma of wheat, coriander, sweet malt and Belgian yeast, smells nice. Flavor is delicious, integrated malt, wheat, sweet cider. Finishes slightly hot (cayenne?) and lightly hopped. Spicing is present but not assertive. Perfectly balanced and tasty. Nice medium to heavy creamy body. I liked this more as the second glass slowly warmed. the only negative is that the alcohol in this 9% beer is well hidden, it's way too quaffable. I sincerely hope that DFH makes this beer again."
""
""
""
" The taste is a pretty enjoyable combination of wheat flavor with cider blend and the subtle vegetal herbal flavor comes out in tertiary with a taste of light alcohol and subtle pepper that augments the yeast flavor with mild cilantro adding the taste. The cider is pretty dry and harder to pick up to me with slight appleskin tannin which leads to the mild cayenne flavor with subtle heat on the palate. Overall a good beer, and interesting concept. I would have liked this better without the cider perhaps, it seems a little muted, but worth a try for sure as it stands apart as an original wheat."
"that being said, I drank the second half after having a decent amount of habanero hot sauce and it actually improved the taste a lot. I'd be interested to hear if others agree with that."
"Bottom Line-You gotta try this its special!"
"Overall: This is a fairly weird beer. I'm not sure that it needed the spice in the finish. I'm glad I tried it, but wouldn't pick up another bottle."
""

"Kinda straddles the definition between wit and tripel at 9%, and it's good. Nothing about it is bizarre, but it's well balanced, considering the ingredients."
""

""
""
"The taste is just as announced on the label. Very drinkable beer with good carbonation. For originality of brewing, I give it a 4.5 overall."
"Overall: A nice, albeit expensive, summer brew. Refreshing and clean. Dangerously hides alcohol amount. Wish the cayenne and apple were a little more prominent."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark gold with a creamy white head that settles to a think cap and some sudsy bubbles. Smells like...a Witbier. Maybe a bit of apple cider and cilantro, but mainly just a banana-forward Wit yeast. Bland. Taste is similarly dominated by a Wit yeast, lots of banana and clove, a touch of apple, and grassy herbs. Not getting any of the cayenne. Tastes like Namaste with some apple. Smooth mouthfeel, fairly creamy, with a medium body and good carbonation. Overall a pretty bland, uninspired beer that tastes like any other Dogfish beer."
"overall a great beer. the style says itbier but it honestly drinks more like a saison. either way, it's delicious and a very nice summer ale."
""
""
""
"O: I did not particularly enjoy this.... A wheat beer with subtle apple character and a load of spice.... Particularly Belgian yeast spice which really dominates this brew.... Maybe enjoyable to some... But not me."
"O: I have a hard time understating how much I appreciate this beer. I am not just saying this because Delton 3030 is probably my favorite album of all time and the fact that I am anxiously awaiting 3030 The Return in September (assuming the time frame is kept). I am really saying it because this beer is very well done. The yeast is not obnoxiously strong, the beer is not too overdone in any one area of Apple, Cilantro, or Cayenne, and these flavors are all distinctly different which makes this beer very good in my book. I am looking forward to the 4 beers that I have left of this. Very well done DFH."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting beer. The apple and citrus is complimented well by the spice of the pepper. I was surprised at how creamy the beer is; I was expecting crisp. It reminds me of the heavier cider (without alcohol) I buy in the fall. The flavors are subtle rather than aggressive, which is not always the case for Dogfish Head beers. I would recommend trying this beer."
""
""
""
"O: One of the more interesting versions of a witbier I've tried recently. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, this is good beer, and represents the masterful blending of strange ingredients typical of Dogfish Head’s brews. The results is a nicely balanced beverage that bears only slight reminders of the 9% ABV, and includes an excellent series of fruit and spice flavors. The tail end of the aftertaste is strange and, in some ways, unpleasant, marking one of the beer’s few weaknesses. Still, this is worth trying."
""
""
"O: I bought DFH Positive Contact as part of the distributed 6-750ml bottle case and i am not at all disappointed with the finished product. As with many DFH beers, it is not overly complex in any way and is a very refreshing summer brew. As a bonus, this one-time production beer has an interesting story behind it and how it was created and makes for a good conversation."
""

""

""

"O: Pretty good. Fairly refreshing on this hot day but perhaps a little too sweet to love or session for me. I'm a big fan of Belgians and this one, while outside the box, has it's roots in a solid witbier."
"O-I'm not a huge fan of this here beer. It has just an off quality to it. The flavors really, really don't mesh together well at all. "
"Considering everything that went into this beer, I thought the flavor profile a bit simple and one dimensional (though enjoyable). Still a nice beer, but just not worth the price tag and hassle of obtaining (IMHO)."
""
""
""
"O: a pretty decent and unique beer. The apple and spice notes are pleasant."
"I have two bottles of this beer and will try pairig the next with some indian food to help accentuate the hidden spices."
"The body is a Wit, all the way. slightly cloudy light yellow body with a decent head. The smell is, well, disappointing at best. I get a slightly sweet Wit. Not spices or adjuncts at all. The taste kind of follows suit. No real heat from the cayenne, no herbal notes from the cilantro, but I do get a crisp feeling from the cider that makes it clean. highlight of the beer for sure. Its super drinkable for 9%."
"Another interesting experiment from Dogfish Head. I love trying their unique beers, and this one was decent. Nothing in it makes it amazing, but it's not bad either. Quite different but I was hoping more of the apple cider qualities were here."
""
""
"I bought an extra bottle to experiment with. The record cover comes with recipes printed on it from top notch chefs (e.g., Mario Batali, Sean Paxton, David Chang)."
"O: I'm a DFH fan - these guys make really good and interesting beer, and I totally recommend this. But, that said, not being familiar with witbiers (or ciders, for that matter), I don't know how this beer may be received by folks coming in with a set of expectations I didn't possess."
""
"Feel is a nice medium, any more this may have been a chore to take down.Not a lot of alcohol intrusion, there is a warming quality. This beer is not bitter at all, hops don't really come into play, but I assume they are holding this one together as of now, because once they fade, this will get on the sweet side."
"O- Good solid beer. Really interesting flavors and very tasty."
"O: I was expecting bigger things from this as I had waited about 4you months to this be released and distributed. Would definitely drink this again though as I feel this has grown on me as I neared the end of the bottle."
"M: Medium bodied. Carbo'ed nicely."
"O- Another good beer from DFH. I feel the 9% ABV is well hidden and the flavors are well balanced. The apples really add to the beer, but I would have liked it to be more apple forward."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high but delicate. Overall, it was a pretty decent beer. I really liked the apple flavors to it and they balanced out the sweet, juiciness of them pretty well. It was actually a lot more normal then I anticipated given the ingredient list, which is probably a good thing."
"O: It wouldn't be a DFH beer if it wasn't weird and polarizing. Having said that though, this is certainly one of the better limited releases in their recent portfolio. There seems to have been some actual thought and care put into this beer, and it shows. I'm sure some will hate this, and I'll totally understand if they do. But for my palate, this one-off was pretty respectable. A continuing sign that things seem to (slowly) be on the up-swing at Deleware's most popular brewery."

"Had on tap at Max's in Baltimore in a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy amber color, fruity nose to it. Listed as a hybrid cider beer.... worries me a bit. Medium bodied, nice mouthfeel. Actually don't get too much of a cider taste at all, but just a well balanced tasty brew with an assortment of fruity flavors and hops. Surprisingly smooth, finishes clean... was pleasantly surprised at how good this beer was... try it out if you can."
"I have to say I did not know what to expect with this one from reading the label, but it's really good. Inventiveness has never been a problem for DFH but execution sometimes is. This one is a real winner though, just a joy to drink. I need to grab another and hold onto it before they run out."
"Overall, just a really good beer. Interesting ingredient choices and it came out alright. I was lucky enough to be at the brewery on the day they released this and I'm excited that it I had the opportunity to try this second batch before most. Good stuff DFH as always. Keep it up!"

"This poured out as a clear golden color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer has a touch of sweet and tart apple aromas to it with some spice notes in there too. The taste of the beer gives off the minimal tartness of the apple used with the mixture of spices added to give this brew some character. The mouthfeel was light and dry with a decent carbonation to it. Overall this beer wasn't much of a Witbier in my opinion but still was drinkable. I wouldn't mind having this one again someday."
