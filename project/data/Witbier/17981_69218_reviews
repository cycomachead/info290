"Final Thoughts: I finally got to visit Florida and knew I had to try Cigar City. This one was one of a couple beers I managed to snag whlile here. This is an awesome great hot weather beer. All in all an excellent Wit. Thumbs Up"

"Light day drinks my beverage.  Beach beer"

"12oz can poured into shaker pint. Hazy yellow liquid with a modest one-finger head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. Aroma is lemon and orange peel, dusty wheat, and coriander. Taste is similar with citrus sweetness and some spicy bite. Light body, thin texture, moderate carbonation, abrupt drying finish."

"Pretty descent beer for what it is"

"A nice straw colored beer with a small white head.  Poured from a 12 OZ  can into a pint glass.   Has a great citrus flavor that goes well with the  Belgian  white style."
""
"best damn white ale in fl"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and almost watery, with a light body, mild fizzy carbonation, and a clean finish that has a blend of spices and malt or yeast. Overall a good summer session brew, but not one meant for a snowy night in January."
""
""
""
"Personal favorite. Nice smooth flavor"
""
""
""
"Good white beer from cigar city"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love cigar city but this one I'm not a fan of. A bit bitter but light, a little too much wheat. Should remember to check the cans dates too from some sellers that stock them too long."
"this is a great white.. White/Weisse beers are so underrated"

"12 oz. can purchased in mid-6/14 in the greater Miami area, FL; dated ""3/20/14," poured into my Weyerbacher tulip glass, drank over 30 minutes"

"Flavorful and refreshing with a funky and curacao touch. A mix of a Saison and a Witbier. It has its own character and flexible enough for summer or even slow drinking."
""
"Sort of like a Blue Moon Belian White slightly less sweet. It is what it is. Maybe on a boat under the hot FL sun. ??? Meh."
"Food match: Those pulled pork sandwiches I salivated over at the event... mmm, pulled pork."
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredible unrated beer! This beer is perfect for being in the Florida sun in any outdoor activity. Incredibly drinkable as in you may find yourself having more.. way more than you anticipated like the entire 6 pack"
""
""
""
"Great Summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I had this beer for the first time paired with raw oysters and spicy horseradish cocktail sauce, and it was an incredible match.  Perfect for mild seafood, sushi, etc.  Probably my favorite Cigar City regular offering."

" Just what I needed for a warm afternoon. Smiles all around this BA after I finished the can."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's easy to imagine how quenching and refreshing this would be on a brutally hot and humid day. The overall crisp and dry qualities make it very easy to get to the bottom of this can. A solid pairing with feta cheese."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yeah, really not overly impressed here. There was a lot of vanilla in both the nose and taste. The aftertaste was a nice bit of wheat and slight hops to finish, that was the good part. There was something a little too sweet that I can't place my finger on. This was good, easy drinking, extremely smooth. Just not blown away by any means. But it did taste like a wheat beer and a sessionable one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Solid witbier out of a can.  Yes, a can.  Perfect for this hot Orlando weather."

"T: Graham cracker, wheat malt, dry toast and grass. Tart and slightly orange finish. Not very sweet. Sides more on the spicier and herbal side of the equation. Sulfuric pear finish. Not complex, straightforward, and one witbier I don't mind revisiting."

"a bit baseline for cigar city, who obviously makes some of the most outlandish and delicious ales on the market. this is a coriander heavy white ale, loosely belgian, and not as good as i expected it to be, although still quite tasty and certainly refreshing. the nose on it is rather floral from the yeast and the hops, cool complexion. the taste is just dumbed down a bit to me though, lacking the dramatic engagement i usually get from cigar city beers. that said, it is a clean finishing well carbonated very summery white ale, and in hot muggy florida weather, i see it as an excellent choice for refreshment. lost in a crowd of awesome craft beers i think, but a decent example of the style. wishing for more of a belgian yeast profile in the taste, and maybe a little more dryness in the feel, but overall a solid brew."

"Fairly clean tasting Wit, works in the heat, but not terribly interesting"

"3.96/5.00"

"Served in a pint at the brass tap. Pours ultra pale straw that's cloudy and hazy. Head is made of large bubbles and deflates fairly quick to a thin sheen of foam across the beer. No lacing. Smells of Belgian yeast and sweet bread with notes if lemon citrus.very clean and straight forward. Taste mirrors the aroma, sweetness is crisp with citrus mixing in a bit. Coriander shows on the pallet and the finish is clean. After taste of unbaked bread. The mouth feel is refreshing and just fizzy enough to excite the taste buds. A wonderful summer option."

""
""
""
""

""
""

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, spice, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, earth, spice, yeast, and slight citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with very earthy aromas and flavors."

"Can that was muled in a car from Florida back to Maryland and it spent a whole week in the trunk in the Florida heat of June. With that said this was a very tasty beer and seemed like an authentic Belgian. I thought it came across more as a hybrid of a Saison / Belgian Blonde ale and not your typical witbier. Perhaps the 100 degree heat changed it. Whether it did or not, its a very solid Belgian beer and feels like 7% and not 5.5%."

"Overall, this is a really good beer. Reminds me a lot of a good German hefe that I had not too long ago. I am on vacation and this beer is not available locally. Guess I need to stock up before I head home."
""
"overall; a filling, more complex take on wheat beers, i can see the appeal but i am not sure if i would ever buy it again."
""
""
""

"O- Solid white ale, nothing special but certainly a good choice for a warm summer evening."
""

"O - decent. Good Belgian style white. Not a homerun."
""
""
""

"Looks okay, smells okay, tastes okay. That pretty much sums up this beer: it's okay. Lemon thing going on with a mild bit of bread and yeastyness to it all. Pretty decent. Kind of out there a bit and not exactly well-rounded. But I have certainly had worse."
"Had this one before but a good friend had his wife bring me another up from Florida so I am doing the full review. Outstanding appearance with a billowing head. Murky but not overly so. Great smell, rocking the belgian. The flavor is outstanding, not as good as the top in the class but very good, tasty, extremely enjoyable. A beer I hope to revisit many times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great brew! Beginning to really like what Cigar City has to offer for beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks a clouded pale golden honey. Smells of coriander, orange, spice and heavy wheat. Not a huge witbier guy but this smells yummy. Taste is sweet and very smooth, lots of balance with the citrus and spice. CCB has done it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Finish: The beer finishes a little spicy but not much else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Smooth, sweet, lightly hoppy, turning dry in the end. Light bodied, crisp, refreshing, comforting. Orange and lemon flavors match beautiful with the spice and roll off the tongue with the wheat. Tastes just like a wit should."
"More character than expected. Yeast esters are nice and somewhat complex, considering some examples I've recently had. Citrus definitely dominates."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A Belgian White with the flavors turned up to eleven making for a refreshing and flavorful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real neat and fun wit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall real drinkable beer with a load of flavor. While it may not be my style this one can be appreciated for being finely crafted. A much better alternative to any of the macro wheat beers."
""
"Poured into a glass from the can, it has a hazy orange color body with a thick fuzzy head on it. The smell has a lemon and spice aroma coming off of the beer. The taste is of citrus first and let it sit on your tongue and the coriander comes out. The mouthfeel is good and overall is a nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, with very active carbonation. Goes down so easily. Overall, a good beer, but nothing that blows me away. Very refreshing, and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit too lemony and spicy overall but an interesting take on the style"
"Overall the carbonation worked quite well in this and curacao peel was a nice take on the style giving it a sharp sour bite. Worth picking up if tired of the same ho hum Witbier."
"O: A solid take on a style that is not my favorite but this is definitely another good beer from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The acidity does hurt the mouthfeel. The body's too light (appropriate, but not enough to hold up to the cutting feel) and carbonation too brisk and brief. It ends too soon, so that the finish is flat, although it does last to that point. The finish isn't as clean as it could be, either. The feel is where it falls short of great Belgians, though it's a very good beer in its totality."
""
""
""
""
"O - Simple but satisfying. Refreshing."
"Had this several times on a trip to Florida. Was pretty good for a basic white, but I stopped getting them once I found the Cigar City Jai Alais for a buck more per 6-pack. The crackers were ok, but couldn't compare to the Jai Alais; from now on, I'll get them when I'm in Florida."
"O: Could have been better, but I still liked it quite a bit, and would recommend it, especially to fans of the style."
""
"M: This is a light-medium body here."
""
""
""
""
"Another beer courtesy of the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden /whiteish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spices, wheat, citrus. Taste is clean and refreshing, lemons, spices, wheat, smooth and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
"Florida Cracker is the Witbier that you drink when the more authentic Belgian varieties aren't around. Feel free to take it down, but don't let you classy mainstay know about it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A good take on a style that doesn't typically impress me too much. Not exactly the most itneresting beer from CC, but very accessible and well crafted. A good transition beer from macros, but also probably just taking space away from better beers in their tanks. All that aside, it's a good Belgian Wit."
""
""
""
"If you like the lightness of a Belgian style and heavy citrus, you'll probably enjoy this beer."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and is very lemony, so it would make for a good selection if you want a witbier with lemon citrus, not the customary orange peel."
""
"Cracker is a pretty good beer and quite bold."
""
""
""
"The admonition to ""pour gently"" does not sit well with The CANQuest (TM), whose perfection of the inverted Glug has been an ongoing venture. I promised the ex-Old Lady, however, that if a CAN specifically forbade this sort of treatment, then I would abide by the brewer/brewery's wishes. The Crack! unveiled a brimful CAN and so a very gentle Glug ensued. It saddened me to do business that way, especially since I only got a sheen of fizzy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated to wisps as a result. Color was a hazy lemon-yellow (SRM = 4 to 5). Nose was kind of light in terms of both orange peel and coriander. My first draught gave me a fizzy, highly carbonated mouthfeel and the taste remained muted for the style. Yes, I was getting the citrus and spice flavors, but nowhere near what I am used to from other beers in the style. Finish was semi-dry and really kind of bland overall. A swing and a miss from a usually stellar brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, nice full head developed, white, with descent retention and lacing. Appearance was a light haze with a golden wheat color. Aroma had notes of citrus and yeast. Taste had strong noted of yeast and bread. Mouthfeel was medium with a dry and slightly sour aftertaste."
""
"Overall, a very tasty take on the witbier. It's a bit lighter and more apologetic than my favorite versions of the style, but one that I would love to have on a hot summer day, when too much witbier spice might come across as suffocating."
""
""
""
""
"A - golden in color, turbid/cloudy, tightly packed thick white head, spritzy. S - Banana, mild citrus and floral tones. T - Sweet maltiness, orange peel, prickly spice, decent balance. M - Med body lightens w/ high carb and spice. O - Very drinkable US weisse beer with tropical citrus tones fitting for Florida."

"Picked up a 6-pack at Triboro Beverage. Another great beer from Cigar City. This beer tastes like it's straight out of Belgium. It's a lot closer to Hoegaarden than Allagash White. The Allagash has a lot of spice and fruit, but Cigar City has a slightly sweet candied wheat with mild vanilla. Basically is a more bready beer, but undeniably a wit. Give it a shot."
""
""
""
"12 oz can. Pours hazy golden with long lasting, foamy, white head. Aroma is of spices, barnyard yeast, wheat malt and crackers. Body is medium and crisp. Spices, citrus fruit, bready malt, funky yeast fill the mouth. Finish is long, semi-dry. Interesting brew, kind of Saison meets Wit."
""
""
""
"It's ok, but not one of my fav whites. Poured at a good temperature with a smallish off-white head that vanishes quickly and no lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy yellow. Aroma is yeast, citrus peel, spice, malt. Flavor's like nose, tang in front along with some bitter, then the other qualities. As it warms more citrus peel comes out. The combination of tang and bettering agents yields a reaction on the back of the tongue that isn't that pleasant; other than that body/carbonation are decent. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, and while not bad, Ike hooegardens much more."
""
"A very refreshing beer that shows Cigar City can brew more than just high-octane beers."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale straw color with little to no head. Nice lemony aroma with just a touch of coriander. Lemon oil, rather than juice is the impression it gives. Lots more lemon in the taste, and again, just a touch of coriander. A bit light in body, even a little seltzer-like, even for the style. Not bad, but could use some more snap and depth."
"The feel was very full, bubbly and expansive but it finished very smooth and light, super easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a white, short lived head. Smells of wheat and coriander. In the taste, dry coriander, citrus zest, orange peel and dusty wheat. Little hop character, mostly spice and wheat. Medium bodied, crisp feel with a light dry yeast. Overall, a nice little wit with a good bit of spice."
""
""
""
""
"Mucho thanks to Three Fishes for the multiple cans. Absolutely tremendous lawn mower beer, hazy in color, citrusy in aroma, and goes down like water. I liked this beer immensely. I didn't drink much of it though, because I aggressively tried foisting it on all of the Blue Moon drinkers I know. That's advocacy for ya' baby. Highly recommended, and an off the chain gateway beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good witbier and very enjoyable. Crisp and refreshing as the style should be. Carbonation should be high in the style, but this perhaps pushes the upper edge...very gassy and foamy beer. Otherwise well done. Would definitely have a few of these in a session without any problem."
""
""
"Note: Canned on 10/24/13 and 'Drink Fresh' emblazoned on the can. Drink fresh indeed, just a couple weeks old."
""
"Carbonation is spot on. Coupled with the overall cleanliness and full but refreshing aspects of this witbier, the mouthfeel is flawless. So smooth and tantalizing. Perfect for hot weather or an everyday sipper. Delicious. CCB shows they can make not only some super-bad ass high gravity stuff, but the softer and easy-drinking selections as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's an okay wit. It's like Florida, a little warmer and wetter than I'd like it to be. Could be more refreshing in a number of ways, and any of those would improve it."

"Pours from the can clear and golden with decent sized head. Aroma of yeast, spice, and a bit of pear-banana. Light mouthfeel, but lower carbonation than expected. Sweet with spicy banana bread and bubble gum. A strange taste on the finish (though i seem to get this with most whites, so maybe it’s my taste buds). Probably one of my faves for the style, but not a huge fan of this style. Nice and sweet. Not bad. Also loving the CCB can designs."

"O- I'm amazed this beer's not rated higher. Cigar City is high high quality. This is an exceptional, every day drinker, outdoor drinker, just amazing beer. Sessionable. Inexpensive. I definitely recommend it!"

"Florida Cracker Belgian style ale is probably the best US made wheat beer that I've had to date!"

"O: not great, but pretty good. An acceptable pool/beach beer for the summer fl heat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really liked it. There are very few domestic wits available in New Orleans, none of which I buy with regularity. If (god willing) Cigar City ever gets its trucks here, this immediately becomes a summer regular. Sharing rarified air with the noble Allagash White."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light and hazy straw yellow, minimal head goes away quickly. Lots of wheat smell here, crisp and clean. A little bubblegum flavor with some banana. I also Get the coriander in there. Lots of carbonation working here, making it very refreshing and easy to drink. I didn't expect this to be this solid of a Belgian White, one of the better ones I've had in sometime."
"O: Nice mild, easy drinking witbier. Sweet citrus flavors, some spices and some wheat. Pretty standard but still way better than something like a blue moon. Easy drinking. Nice summer beer."
""
"O: I don't think I am a fan of this style. The carbonation is a bit strong for me and not a big fan of the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: definitely spicier than i expected. its good, but not great. a summer drinker for sure, and light enough to have with a meal"

"The comparison to Blue Moon is not possible to avoid. Cracker White is a bit lighter and more unique than a Moon. Tried it out of the can and then tried it poured ice cold into a pilsner glass with a slice of organic orange. It's nothing straight out of the can. However, poured over the orange slice and ice cold, it beats a Moon hands down. The color meshes with the orange in the glass. Overall, this is a very, very enjoyable ale here in the Northeast Florida heat and we'll be buying it on a regular basis."

"Poured from tap into pint at yard house in palm beach gardens fl. Pours a super hazy golden wheat color with a finger of head. Very mild aroma of hefe fruity meets flowers. Very delicate flavor...vanilla and citrus with a hint of spice. Really super smooth and refreshing. Great light session hefe as they can get overwhelming but this is great. Nice brew."
""

"O: A standard because it's always fresh in Florida, a great beer to get into Belgian styles, but nothing groundbreaking."

"O-A solid witbier, very sessionable and approachable."
"Overall - Great witbier all-around. It doesn't kill me that this beer isn't on shelves in California, but it'd be a welcome addition if it were."

"Had this before at a wedding in FL. It was nice there. Pours a near excellent clarity golden with a solid central dome of bone white foam, unimpressive for the style. Smells of flowers, grass, some light lemon, a little bit of sweet dough and seeds of paradise. Flavor is nice and sweet with yeast overtures and some bits of coriander. Pretty one dimensional flavor, but refreshing nonetheless. Thin bodied for the style with hi carb and a wet finish. Meh."

"The beer pours a straw yellow with a rocky soap bubble head that collapses into a fizzy, thick scrim. The beer’s body is cloudy but clean and free of particles with a lazy and slow stream of bubbles treading towards the top of the glass. On the nose the beer smells of sweet orange peel, cuaraco with lemon sweet bread notes and a touch of bitter grass. There is also a bready sweet note that stands apart from the lemon and reminds me of a sweet cracker, which goes nicely with the beer’s name. On the tongue the beers tastes of bready sugars and citric lemon acid. The flavor begins as sweet lemon bread, opening into grassy hops and orange peel flavors with a touch of coriander spice. The finish suggests slight green vegetal apple flavor with notes of lemon and grass, then dips into a creamy cracker flavor briefly as the beer warms, but quickly washes away, this flavor really has to be searched for though and is not abundantly clear to the palate. The aftertaste is very light and clean. From the can, the beer smells nearly the same, and tastes a little sweeter due to the concentration of flavors in the tiny can opening. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a slight wateriness. The carbonation is a little sharp on the tongue, and the mouth is left slightly sticky with nice amounts of saliva from the acid in the beer. Overall, this is a nice sessionable wit with some interesting flavors. I don’t really get the cracker flavor, but I can see what the brewers were reaching for with this beer. It’s tasty, sessionable, and worth a try. A nice middle of the road wit."
""
"O- A pretty good wit. Big on the orange/citrus flavor which works nicely with the yeast."
""
""
""
"a cloudy lemon-yellow pour with 2 fingers of fluffy white head, great retention and spotty lacing left behind. smells of black pepper, lemongrass, hint of celery, very bready/yeasty. a slightly funky, peppery belgian style wheat beer.. the majority of the flavor lies within the yeast. a medium (on the lighter side) body beer with high carbonation. very tasty.. i guess this would be a good step into craft beer for people that like hoeegarden or whatever the hell that beer is called.. not my favorite style, but definitely tasty."

"I would definitely enjoy this beer again and would push this on lighter beer drinkers who are searching for blue moon/shocktop type beers. It's a beer that pushes those two beers out of the water for sure. Does this style beer much justice."

"Had this from can to glass on 3/21/13, originally canned on january 17, 2013. So fresh! I was excited to try it as I've heard it was a damn good beer. Nice bright yellow color. Very refreshing mouthful. You totally taste the crackers in the beer. Another cool thing... Watch out for the messages on the bottom of the cans."

"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it poured a slightly hazy, pale gold color with no head. The nose is very muted, with floral (juniper?) smells, and very light spicing. The beer is light and smooth, with flavors of slight sour citrus and a smooth, bready spicing. Light in mouth, this beer has an aftertaste that is mostly coriander spicing. The finish is minimal and quick, making an easy drinker."
""
"Overall: This is a very safe Witbier, as it simply falls the rulebook, but the execution is fantastic. Improve the appearance and finish, and this would be world class."

"O - Overall, not a bad white ale in a pinch. That said there are much better wits out there that are readily available. Still, another unique beer."
"o: not a bad white ale, certainly a good beer on a warm spring or summer day, but the mouthfeel brought this one down."
"o - overall...cracker please. not my favorite beer and not my favorite wit, but definitely not a bad wit. actually a pretty good wit."
"Overall: was disappointed to see old Jai Alai on the shelf, but this more than made up for it. A delicious warm weather beer"

"This is a light, tasty, easy drinking belgian style beer that I can imagine being extremely refreshing on a hot summer day. I'd definitely pick up a six pack of these for mowing the lawn or laying on the beach."

"Listed as a witbier, but it drank more like a spin-off of a toned down Belgian style. Not a bad crack at the style, especially when you consider the relatively low ABV, but nothing comes close to the real thing. I could imaging this one going down well on a warm beach somewhere."

"Pretty good Wit, although admittedly not a style I normally seek out."

"Despite the can-craze this beer (not unlike Avery's White Rascal) is about a full point lower. Obviously everything is better on tap but I just don't think I'm buying into this can thing. Maybe others are different but I still feel like there's a hint of metal in the taste no matter what they tell me. Even with that I still love this brew."

"Cost: $8.99 for a six pack of 12 oz cans."
"Overall - A decent well rounded beer but nothing ground breaking by any means. The one thing I really like about it the fruity notes taste natural and not too artificial. A beer worth trying."
"8.0/10"
"Overall, this is a pretty admirable wit. Domestically, this falls behind the Allagash offering, but it does rise high up for the style produced domestically."

"Pretty good overall"

"O - a good witbier, could see enjoying this on a muggy summer evening."

"Pours a pale, hazy yellow with tons and tons of bubbles sticking to the glass. The head dissipated rather quickly. Aroma is very average and resembles most wits and hefes I've come across. In the nose I get a lot of banana, spicy cloves, and a tinge of orange. A very ""yeasty"" smelling brew. Taste follows the nose exactly. Nothing else really jumps out at me. Carbonation is high, but not too high and the mouthfeel is light to medium. Overall, this is a tasty wit, but nothing new or original. To me, this brew falls in the hefe category more so than a traditional wit. I say this because that signature banana smell/taste in hefes is the predominant taste in this beer. Definitely worthy of a try, but nothing life-changing like other CC offerings. Get it if it's available in your area, but I do not recommend trading for it."

"D - overall, this is a nice white ale. Good flavors all around and nice complexity for the style. As with any CCB beer, its definitely worth a shot."
"Overall (3.5): This is a decent wit; it’s not amazing, but it’s great that Cigar City is offering a decent wit in cans for about $8/ sixer. It’s not the best domestic wit I’ve had, but it’s a decent value. I’m guessing this will accrue quite a bit of popularity—tasty enough, juicy, and easy-drinking, at a reasonable price. And it offers more character than some other widely-available, comparably-priced alternatives. But, don’t expect a life-changer."

"I like this witbier. While it has poor head retention for the style, the flavor is far more intense and satisfying than many witbiers, and I want to follow one taste with another. I could drink several glasses of this low ABV beer, no problem. After reading the description of the beer on the can, I understood that the saison yeast is a big reason why I like this beer. I had this beer on draft at GABF this year and liked it quite a lot, and it is tasting nice out of the can as well."
""

"Hm, the only beer description I've ever seen relate a story of how ""cracker"" came into historical parlance. Right on. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, cracked wheat, coriander, and light clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more zest from the orange and a twinge of lemon zest for good measure. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little wit, something I could easily see drinking plenty of were I down in the Sunshine State's climate."
"Very good."

"O/T - With respect to the name, for those not from Florida, Florida Cracker is a good thing, not a slur."

"Overall: This one is light and summer, but not very interesting. I might have another depending on the situation."
"O - Not exciting, but a solid enough witbier to be enjoyed. Some stronger lemon flavor would help this."

"Feels wet and dusty. Light tingle."
"20 oz on tap, straw yellow clear like a light lager but damn is the look misleading! Candy sweet funky yeast and pale malt steal the nose, wow! This is a great smelling brew! Taste follows the nose - orange peel, clove, light maltiness, candy sweet yeast funk, light citric hop bite at the end. Carbonation is beautiful & so is this brew!"

"O-This one was ok, but nothing I'd seek out again. Wish I could give this one a 3.25 overall, but I can't...so I'll give it a 3.5."

"Pours a cloudy gold color with a two finger head into my bruery tulip with intense lacing. Aroma of hops, spices(especially coriander) and orange. Taste follows the nose, lightly sweet but not overdone, bitterness of hops balances. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a little too carbonated but not crazy. I love this beer, it's the best representation of the style to me."
"I had this at the Kickbacks Cigar City/St Somewhere dinner. I'm reviewing this by memory on this I had this at the Kickbacks Cigar City/St Somewhere dinner. I have had most of CC's regular beers but I have not tried this yet. not a fan of this style but this was atleast well done. spice and citrus and decent hop presence made this a decent wit."
"Nice balance, nice crisp body, and easy to drink."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Another solid offering from CCB. Would make a great summer beer. Worth a shot."
"O-i always expect a lot from CCB so this beer lets me down. its fairly harsh for a witbier. it actually reminds me of the harshness of many wits from Belgium. this style should the kind you want to drink large amounts of all night long, but this just isn't the case here."
"Overall: Very nice beer for the Florida heat. The peppery notes add flavor without taking away from the refreshing nature of the beer."
"O: an excellent choice for hot summer days, this is a very refreshing and good tasting beer."
"O: Awesome stuff, and if I lived in Tampa, I'd pick up growlers of this stuff all the time."
"The aroma started out very light. Nice touches of light malts, grains, with a touch of light fruit mixed in. Very floral with a light earthy tone to it and a really nice touch of coriander or orange peel way in the back. The flavor was more of the same, very light, with a very well carbonated and airy feel to it. Started out with a good bit of light grain, and started to mix in some light fruit and touches of orange and lemon as you go. Nice light earthy flavor in the middle, like flower petals, or light heather almost. Clean taste, with a quick finish that really just gets started before it dries out enough that that you are going back in for another one"
"Medium body and effervescence with a slightly drying aspect. Nice lingering aftertaste though. I like this brew. Probably the lightest one of CCB's I've had to date but just as good as the reputation would lead you to believe."

"O: Very good summer brew. I could drink quite a lot of this in the hot summer days here in FLA. I hope this one makes it way back on in the future. Skal."
"Pours a murky light amber with two fingers of white foam, settles leaving wispy rings of lace along the way. Smell: spicy and slightly citric with light fruit esters, lightly toasted. Taste: pale sweetness, wheat cracker, a little sweet caramel, quite spicy, lemon, notes of clove and greenish banana. Light-medium bodied, active carbonation, spicy and mineral finish. More than your usual wit; amped up all around, except for the abv. From growler filled 5/21."
"O - Great summer beer, no doubt."
