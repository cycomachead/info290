"This is the Best thing to drink at the break of Spring."
"Honestly thought the flavor was the least spectacular part about this beer. That and it was over 2 months past the ""best taste"" date."
""
""
""
"From the bottle.  Aroma is wit beer with citrus.  Taste is wit beer profile with citrus and a mild spicy finish.  Mouthfeel feel is light but satisfying.  Overall a drinkabke winter seasonal wheat beer."

"Mouthfeel is light and smooth.  Not a bad summer drink but lacking the complexity of a good Witbier."
""
""

"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a weizen glass. Hazy as per the style, a dull yellow-orange with around one finger of lacy white head clinging to the sides of the glass. Aroma bright and citrusy, orange, tangerine, lemon, and lime rinds with a little pineapple, woody seed spice, candied ginger, and faint grassy hops. These same elements echo on the palate. Minimal malt/wheat flavor here, with this eschewed in favor of citrus soda, ginger, very light coriander (Sam Adams does a good job of not overdoing this with their wits), and an odd metallic sweetness. Fizzy, with a curiously empty body and a saccharine metallic finish. Sam Adams brews a number of witbier variations and this is not one of the stronger takes. Great aroma and an OK showcase for the citrus and spice flavors but lacking in body and malt backbone."
""
"Overall:  So far this brew is ok. It is smooth with some citrus to the taste. Has a nice balance to it.  Good Refreshing summer beer."

"Poured from the 12 ounce bottle into a Hefeweizen glass. poor is a beautiful opaque golden orange color obviously unfiltered. Smell is very rich of spices citrus slight coriander. the order is someone intoxicating but I believe it is a false pretense to the actual flavor of the beer. Flavor is of sweetness and bitterness at roughly the same time definite taste of coriander right at the beginning it fades away into a gravelly carbonated finish. not feel as I said it was very carbonated and it goes down slightly gravelly. All in all it is an average beer. Not Sam Adams' best."

"Samuel Adams White Lantern brewed by Boston Beer Company with an ABV of 5.5% This brew pours out cloudy amber color with a small, white head. White Lantern is an unfiltered brew; you can not see thought it. The smell is rich with grains,spices ,and a hit of bitterness. So far this brew is ok. Now for the taste, it is smooth with some citrus. The mouthfeel is nice, clean,and refreshing. This brew has a nice balance to it, I would get this brew again. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5 ."

"Just as the label says, spices and citrus peel with an excellent aftertaste. One of my all time favorites. I thoroughly enjoyed it. How long do these comments have to be before the bros at beer advocate will accept it??? I'm not the best taste analyzer so have mercy on me ba!"

"This is an ok beer, but I feel nothing really makes it stand out. I enjoyed drinking it, and it goes well with food, but it didn't have a strong taste of its own. A pretty standard witbier, I did like the smell, which smelled a bit sweet, and went with the flavor well."
""
"This is a cloudy medium gold beer with a substantial head on top of it--really good pour in this chalice glass. The nose is sweet--reminds me of cheerios. Rather bit of an odd candy-citrus flavor, but not unpleasant. The flavor though, doesn't really taste anything like a real wit. I can't find any coriander to taste. The citrus is like the nose--odd. The yeast character is a little fruity, but barely. Not a very drinkable beer."
"O - These are delicious! Would make for a great session brew. Cheers!"

"O - Very poorly done or I had an off product but I was well within the freshness date. Not a whole lot here. Tastes like a dull malt"
"Very much a newbie sort of witbier, the spice and fruit treated with way less subtle deference than the stars of the style. That's not to say that this isn't good - it is - it's just that I get too much of that American, hit me over the head with the amped-up versions of the aspects that should duly be left as they are, thing. Dare I say, 'chick' - no, cross that, ok, 'hipster' beer?"

"The feel of this beer is light bodied and goes down pretty easy. There is a nice slight crisp feel and is nice and smooth going down."

"Poured from 355 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted 9/2/2013."
""
""
"A good beer for summer. Pour was a light yellow with a bit of a haze in it. The smell was mostly citrus and fruit, some banana which I thought was interesting. The taste is primarily that of wheat mixed with hops that have big citrus flavor. It was thin, but with the taste added for a refreshing summer beer. Found in the summer variety pack and was pleasantly surprised by it."

"OVERALL: this is a good beer but nothing special, there are better Belgian White Ales out there so I would probably not buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, but not great either. The light citrus character in the taste gives some character to a beer that otherwise is pretty ""meh."" Again, it's not bad, but I see no reason to buy this again."
"Great session beer, lemony, a great beer on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with a medium white head. Aroma and Taste is of wheat, biscuit malt some lemon and hay, mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, crisp, refreshing and nicely balanced with mild carbonation. The finish is wheat, hay, biscuit malt and some sweet lemon notes and light bitterness. I good refreshing solid brew."

"Overall: Similar to Blue Moon. A nice wheat beer, very light. Easily drinkable. Would have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a terrible beer, but way too similar to so many other Sam Adams beers of a similar style. Not worth drinking again. Lacks complexity."
""
""
"O- I've been seeing a lot of seasonal brews from Sam Adams lately and decided to give this one a try. To me it is like a Blue Moon with the orange garnish already in the bottle. Which ain't bad. This is a good example of a Belgian style white ale although could come across a little sweet."
""
""
"O - I liked it, but nothing I would crave again. might pair well with food tho, have yet to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, but not great, it's excellent for making beer batter and I wouldn't turn it down if someone offered me one, but I'm not going to buying it again."

"Overall, this is the third wit I've sampled from Sam Adams, and unfortunately, they've produced two of the least favorite wits I've ever had, this being one of them. Interestingly enough, the two I haven't cared for made me feel that way by missing the wit style on opposite ends of the spectrum. One was over-saturated and hot while this one was bland and boring. This one might be a good place to start for someone who is wanting to ease into the style, and likes lighter, crisper lagers and ales, but for someone wanting genuine witbier taste, this is not the way to go."

"Mouthfeel: i think this was the worst of all; soapy mouthfeel and when it goes down rough on the throat it really lingers in flavor"
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: Sams White Lantern has a smooth light palate with a light malt base, a hint a spice and a touch of citrusy bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A greatly refreshing, crisp witbier. The spiciness, while it does make it stand out from every other 'orange peel and coriander' wheat beer, might not be what you want for a summer thirst quencher. Still, I have to give them credit for making a unique beer, true to style, and one that works."
""
""
""
""
""
"I am surprised by the low ratings. This beer is quite good for a wit with spice. Pours a cloudy light gold with a fair head that has low lacing that dissipates quickly. Not much nose, but there is slight floral sweetness present. Balance is outstanding with a stylistic mouthfeel. It finishes with a burst of spice, as intended, with no hop bitterness aftertaste. This a very good summer ale - quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is a step up from what I expected after the aroma. Decent spicy and citrus notes mingle well with the biscuit malts and a smooth slightly lingering finale."
""
""

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and goes down easily. It reminds me a lot like a Blue Moon except that it has more flavors of orange peels."

""
""
"3.56/5.00"
""
""
"Remarks: Decent take on a Witbier overall. I'm glad to see they used noble hops in the recipe. I think citrusy hops would have been too much for the style."
""
""
""
""
"A bit unusual and off the beaten path. Perhaps for certain palates and/or certain types of days or occassions. This one is ok to accompany the recent heatwave we've just endured."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it seems very similar to Sam Adams Summer Ale, but a decent beer overall."
"Pours a nice hard copper color. Nice head but dissipates quickly. Scents of orange peel, and coriander spices on the nose. Non see through appearance. Quick burst of tingling fruity goodness on the initial sip with that same tingling moving from the front to back of the tongue. Very smooth and slightly tart. A bit thin, but true to the style. Smooth and easy drinking. Good session beer especially for spring and summer. Similar to the original ""white ale"" by samuel adams. Better than I expected. Loved the original white ale and this may be just as good. A well crafted, flavorful stab at the Belgian style."
""
""
""
""
""
"When i poured this beer, it has a hazy golden color body with a small white head, that quickly dissapears. The smell is very aromatic of orange and coriander. The taste has a nice orange flavor to is, not overpowering and the coriander and other spices come through really nice and subtle on the back of the tongue. the mouth feel is great, well carbonated and balanced. this is one of the better witbier i have had."
""
"decide to review another one of the beers from the spring seasonal pack from sam adams.poured from the bottle into a plisner glass. a hazy color thats reminds me of pear juice with a light head.aroma is a nice blend of citrus and honey. nice flavor of coriander and citrus."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, White Lantern is a hazy, peachy-wheat color with a thin, active white head. The nose is sweet and spicey, corriander is definitely noticable which complements the otherwise orangy-citrusy backdrop. The flavor is what you would expect based on the taste. Very similar to Blue Moon, but possibly a bit more tart and not quite as sweet. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with a mouthcoating carbonation. Overall, a good beer, nothing outrageous but definitely a solid beer."
""
"Overall: This was a decent brew, I drank the whole 6 pack of it my wife got me, so I guess it was good!"
""
""

""
""
""

"overall I like this beer. Honestly its pretty much a summer ale with slighty more of an orangey character. Actually , and I hate to say this, its a slightly less good Blue Moon. Coors made a better product than Sam? Is snow falling on Satan?"
""
""
"4.0 D: Pretty good beer with no real faults."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before August 2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, tangerine, orange peel, pear, coriander, pepper, wheat, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance of malt, spice, and yeast notes; but it is very weak. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, coriander, pepper, wheat, bread, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, coriander, pepper, wheat, bread, light clove, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice and pleasant flavors with good balance of malt, spice, and yeast esters; with a fair amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very solid witbier. A little weak on flavors; but is well balanced and very easy to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
""
"If you drink, please don't drive, but if you drive, then do us all a favor and don't drink...stay safe..."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a very cloudy orange yellow with a small white head. Smells of wheat and orange, very inviting. Tastes of orange and a little wheat. Beer is carbonated correctly and goes down great, very drinkable light body. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
"O - There just seems to be something off about this beer. There was no head and an almost flat mouthfeel. The taste was average at best. It is not one of the better beers that I have had from BBC."
""
""
""
""
""
"Run of the mill wit. Not quite good enough to be average, not even as good as Blue Moon. Skip this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice head, and some decent lacing. Nose is just a little wheat with some hints of orange. Wheaty, with some orange rind, and spice. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"The Rest: This reminds me more of a German-style Hefewiesen then anything Belgian. It lacks that funkier Belgian yeast characteristic. Regardless, its pretty decent and easy drinking."
"O- easy drinking and a good choice for a summer day outside, but doesn't stand up to the better examples of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fine beer for what it is, I personally would rather grab a glass of more ""authentic"" witbiers that wouldn't be too far away from this on the shelf. Sam Adams still delivers....warmer weather this brew is definitely more appreciated. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Rather like a Wit on training wheels though easy to drink"
""
""
""
"Pours an apricot golden hazy hue with a bright white head, forms fines speckled lacing. Aroma is hitting hard with grains of paradise, sharp wheat, and hints of citrus and coriander spiciness. Flavor is a bit one dimensional with heavy spice a mix of coriander and grains of paradise, with some juicy citrus and bitter apricot pit. Mouthfeel is medium on the palate carbonation a bit sluggish for how heavy the spices linger between sips, I could use something more palate cleansing. The Sam Adams house yeast weighs heavy on this one bringing out a bready, nutty character that pretty much dampers the experience for me. It was like a spring release of the Summer Ale toned down a bit."
""
""
"overall, this experiment from Sam Adams just misses the target for me. i should like it, but i just don't and that's ok."
""
""
"Though not unpleasant, this is was very average. I rarely find myself saying this about witbiers, but it could've used some more spice to liven things up a bit. Wheat beers don't seem to be Sam Adams strong point..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, and it just makes more of a statement for Sam Adams. I do not really consider Sam Adams ""craft"" beer in anyway, but most of their products are cheaper, and simply better tasting than some of the other ""craft"" beer on the market."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and Slight lacing. Smells of coriander, sweet malt, slight hops, hint of pine, slight pale malt. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of coriander, syrup-orange, sweet malt slight pale malt, slight hops, and a hint of pine. Overall, weak aroma, body has too much syrupy orange flavor, weak appearance, but feel is good."
""
"SA makes more craft beer with training wheels"
""
""
""
"Feel is a bit rich for the style and excarbated by the under represented carbonation level in the pour. Easy drinking nonetheless in a sense as the light carbonation and lack of stops on the bus route of flavor allow for a quick trip to your destination, that being the bottom of the glass."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Of the six different beers in the spring sampler pack I was looking forward to White Lantern the least. However, it has turned out to be better than some of the others. If you like Blue Moon then this one will probably blow your mind. Would I drink it again? No."
"O - like I said, good summer beer. As far as wheat beers go, it's pretty well balanced between flavour and drinkability."
""
"Overall: this is not an outstanding witbier, but it works in a pinch. It's probably quite nice on a hot sunny day."
""
"A well made wit, suitable for a warm afternoon."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent light wheat ale with some nice citrus and coriander notes."
"O: This is a very good white ale that fans of the style who enjoy a lot of citrus will like. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing."
"O) An OK beer. I'd drink another if the options were limited."
"Eh. It's been too long for me to remember, is this any different than the old SA spring wheat. Spritzier maybe? SA sure does love those Grains of Paradise."
""
"This is certainly now my favorite wheat beer, flavorful, refreshing, and brief, a burst of complexity on the tongue that doesn't leave any unpleasant aftertaste. Food recommendations include quesadillas, enchiladas, or cheesesteak sandwiches if you crave something heavy, but I find it perfect just on it's own. Cheers!"
""
"There is a light citrus and spice to the taste. The smell is that distinctive, wheat citrus. It is fairly lackluster for the type. Nothing spectacular stands out; or rather, nothing is distinctively great about it. I would not get this again."
""
"O: Overall the spicing and mouthful wasn't as sharp as i like or prefer by style (hoegarrden) is a very good example and measuring stick of both. The spicing was soft, and almost homogenized to the point it was hard to distinish individual quality. The sourness factor was turned down a bit. Overall i usually like sam adams approach to drinkability while maintaining a good level of flavor and respectability, though by style this is a hard one to do both. The flavor is a light and enjoyable one to throw back to, just dont expect a big wit style here."
""
""
"At only $1 a beer in the 12pack, this one is worthy enough."
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this one. Wheat beers aren't my favorite style but summer is on the way and this one will be a nice warm weather treat."
""
"O: Meh, just another wheat beer, nothing special. Not horrible, its ok, probably wouldn't say no to another one although I wouldn't seek this out either. Try it if you like lighter beers."
""
""
"O- Can't really say I care for this. Maybe I'd like it better if I were on a boat or something."
"Overall a strong contender in the flavor category but not the aroma category."
""
""
"White Lantern pours a cloudy light gold color. The aroma is an onslaught of citrus, with a hint of traditional witbier spicing. The citrus from the nose isn't nearly as strong on the tongue, providing a mellow orange with a low level of spices floating over it. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability is good. White Lantern is easy-drinking and surely targeted at the Blue Moon/Shock Top crowd. I'll take it over either of them for sure."
""
""
" The flavor is decent with the appropriate level of spice without going overboard, more of a lemon zest flavor and slight wheat yeast tanginess is the dominant flavor with very mild malt and the carbonation level is scrubbing away a lot after the swallow so a kind of dry yeast flavor in the finish. Overall this is an ok beer, but not my first choice when it comes to the style, I basically drank it because luck of the draw in a sampler pack"
""
""
"12oz bottle from a 12pack spring sampler. Pours a hazy greyish(?)- golden color with a fluffy, white head that sticks around for awhile. Aroma is somewhat sour with wheat, citrus,spice, orange zest, tangerine. Tastes are slightly sour and tart with soggy wheat, tangerine, mandarin orange, coriander, pepper. Thinner body with moderate carbonation. Overall, not the greatest witbier - disappointingly odd, to say the least."
"O: Overall, I think this is a good Belgian-style White Ale and kind of reminds me of my first Sam Adams which was their White Ale. Not the best beer in their Spring Thaw, but a good sipper for the season."
"White Lantern is alright in my book. If you’re looking for a pretty tasty beer that’s simple, straight forward, and drinkable, check it out. It’s not a great Witbier, but it’s pretty good. It could be improved with a stronger nose, bolder spices, and a tad more body. It’s definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent witbier that does what it was made to be. Light feeling, sessionable and with a decided spicy finish, this is a good beer to watch the temperature warm to summer with."
""
""
""
"I think that this was so light that it was able to completely hid the alcohol, as this didn't feel like beer at all. I'm sure it was there but I just never felt it and I could have had a few of these in a session, had my taste buds been watered-down a bit. This beer wasn't so much a disappointment as much as it just didn't feel like beer. This should have come with a cork on the bottle or ""Brut"" written on the side of it but I'll take it for what it is - the first new offering from Sam Adams in a while that just didn't measure up."
""
""
""
"This is definitely a Belgian wit. Compared to some others this version from SA is real heavy on the orange-especially the peel. Spicy-lots of coriander. Plenty of malt body but it is overshadowed by the heavy dose of orange peel and coriander. Carbonation is appropriately medium/high. An ok wit-would prefer it a little more naked."
"This is by far the weakest of the Spring Thaw pack. If I want a good and familiar wit, I'll go after Hoeegaarden or even Blue Moon. To me, this beer just doesn't have a very strong foundation. Meh."

"Spices and wheaty nuttiness up front. Grains of paradise and coriander are plenty strong here. Grainy wheat malt partners up with banana mid-palate. Citrus peel (orange mostly) zests up the finish. Lingering spice and banana-ish malt. Medium bodied, with a nice creamy feel. A bit of a spice bomb, but a nicely-made one at that."
"Well, much better than their White Christmas. Hazy straw with a white head that dies quickly. Notes of tangerine and orange on the nose. Taste of tangerines as well with a slightly sweet finish. Both creamy on the front of the tongue and a bit sharp on the back of the neck. Still a strain to consider this in league with Vedett and Hoegaarten, but a tasty beer if you like something sweet."
""
"probably the least impressive beer in this years spring mix. weirdly familiar though, has this been in here before? maybe under another name. I don't know. anyways, it pours a pale hazy shade of yellow, with a quickly dying white head. the nose is overly coriander and orange juice, with a lot of malted white wheat. I was hoping for a bit more of a Belgian yeast vibe in the flavor, but it really isn't there, as this is closer to a german hefe than a Belgian wit in a number of ways. the orange element is also pretty weak, and its too herbal from the coriander. it is refreshing, but its also a little soapy. fine carbonation and a less than medium body makes it pretty drinkable, but I just don't feel like drinking more than the two per 12er that comes in this box. its really underwhelming, especially after sam has made some pretty fun wits over the years. this is one to pawn off on your guests."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, White Lantern is a pretty decent Witbier but probably not something I would purchase again in the future."
"I dislike the possibility that I might have left anything in the bottom of the bottle with such styles, so I am a king of agitation. In this case, it resulted in a dense, fluffy finger of bone-white head with great retention that allowed me to ensure that I had emptied the bottle. Clarity was indeed hazy, not cloudy, so I give them props for truth in advertising and the color was an orangish-yellow. Nose really gave off orange (peel) and tangerine and I was anxious to compare this to the previous beer that I reviewed of the same style. Mouthfeel was big and full, not overly carbonated, but more creamy. In fact, the taste reminded me of a Dreamsicle/ Creamsicle, which was the frozen novelty that consisted of a vanilla ice cream center enrobed by orange sherbert. I used to love them as a kid in the summertime. Ah, nostalgia while drinking beer. There is nothing better. I finally got the spiciness on the finish, but they really dialed it in to the point that it did not interfere with the orange. I have had wits that tasted and felt as though I had sprinkled black pepper on my tongue and it is not a pleasant experience. Neither is its polar opposite, in which the brewer cannot pull the trigger and it ends a bland, watery mess. This was good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite, but enjoyable enough."
""
""

"O: This is an okay beer, I like it but I don't love it. I'm not sure I'd go out looking for a 6-pack but if it was offered to me I'd happily drink it. It's not a straight forward witbier that's for sure. The base may be in a wit but the spices are too much in the forefront for it to be faithful to the style."
""
"Label is notched by best June 2013. Man this is juicy for a wit. You know what it reminds me of? Blue Moon. The aroma has a cleaner whole-grain bread note with a dash of pepper, and the flavor does still resemble a wit, but it's closer to Blue Moon than Hoegaarden or Allagash White. There's a mild tart feel with floral tangerine flavor with more smooth, doughy bread. Make sure you let this one warm up for at least 20 minutes, it's much better at cellar temps. The fruit is still on the heavy side, along with the floral spices, but it's an interesting enough take on the style."

"The mouthfeel is bigger than expected without going too big for the style, It's got some substance to it, and it really has a nice, rolling, rich flow to it with plenty of smoothness mingling with a pleasant crisp bite off a solid carbonation."
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall it's just okay, although the appearance and mouthfeel are letdowns. Not a very good example of a wit. The flavor is good, but the rest of the beer isn't working. Drinkability is not there either, one is enough and I'm not real inclined to have another."
"O: Nothing really stands out about this beer for me - it tastes like any number of other lighter witbiers that are available on the market (in fact, I think there are a couple of other Sam Adams ones that are similar)."
""
"O - this is a nice witbier. I liked it better than some other American versions out there."

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours cloudy yellow with a slowly dissipating white head. There are lots of visible tiny bubbles visible in the beer. The beer smells of bread, orange, coriander, and pepper. The aromas are pretty subdued overall. The beer tastes pretty clean. There's the wheat as well as the orange which come through strongest. The coriander and grains of paradise provide some background flavor. While the beer has a nice clean taste, there's a good malt backbone here which helps give this a light to medium body. The carbonation is pretty moderate and the finish is clean and smooth. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer."
""
"Cheers!"

"The White Lantern from Sammy Ale is decent and reminds me alot fo the White Ale, White Christmas, etc that they have had. The beer pours pale clear yellow with white head that is not lacing. The smell has hints of citrus, orange peel and spice. The taste has a battle between the citrus and spice with a good malt base and slightly bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with decent carbonation. Overall this is good....but there are so many other great beers that this would be lost in the crowd."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A decent drinking wit but quite yeasty and a little strange/dirty with almost a melon character about it. I just wasnt feeling it with this brew and would not choose to drink this again if there were other options."
"The orange and coriander are rather distinct in the flavors. A bitterish tang at the end. Pleasant and gulpable. It's hard to find much fault with this, but it's a little on the acidic side. A 12 oz bottle from the Spring 12-pack purchased at the local supermarket."

"A beginner beer for the style. It hits the style points but they are very light. Very easy to drink."
""
"Hazy straw, white head that builds well but falls quickly, no lacing left behind. Typical sanitized American brewed version of a Wit. Lightly doughy and crackery with a whiff of oatmeal aroma. Bright orange flavor with a prominent spice - coriander and clove. Quick, insipid finish. Pretty standard Witbier, the tangerine twist gives a slightly brighter citrus flavor than many but otherwise not much to write home about. It seems like Sam Adams brews a lot of spiced wheat beers, chalk this up as another average one."
""
""
""
"Cloudy light straw colored appearance. Great fruity potpourri aroma with citrus notes. Floral, citrus, hoppy taste. Good flow over palate. Great drinkability. Would be great in the summertime, as weird as that sounds with a beer called White Lantern. Slightly bitter. Finishes just slightly drier."
"Very drinkable, not the greatest wit out there, but enjoyable none the less..."
""
""
"Aroma of citrusy spices, very pleasant on the nose. Pours a hazy medium yellow, with white but, very short lived head. Spotty lacing. Taste is crisply spicy and refreshing. Coriander and sweetgrass with a touch of lemon zest. Slightly sour finish."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a pale, hazy, yellow-gold coloring with a ton of carbonation and a sparse, filmy coating of white head. Aromas of apricot and orange rind, with a bready and slightly buttery undertone. Very sugary sweet smell overall. Flavors of bread, first and foremost, with a blended marmalade highlight of sweet citrus and apricot. Unbalanced, and a touch cloying. The body is thin and filmy from the carbonation, and there is a sharp, frothy finish. Syrupy sweet aftertaste. This beer is a little much on the sweet for me, but I could see it being appealing to the cider population venturing into the beer world."
""
""
""
"The slightly racist member of the Lantern Corps...? Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy pale yellow-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, a pinch of black pepper, and a vague sense of citrus peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with less pepper and a tad more citrus. Everything still comes across as watered-down, artificially muted. It doesn't wanna be gagged, but what victim does, right? The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty meek wit, one with precious little spicing and a character so bland Michael Bay wants to replace him with something more rounded for one of his background characters."
"I don’t know that I would seek this one out. It’s basically the Summer Ale in a different bottle."

"O - Not a bad beer, but something just tasted off to me. Just tasted like it wasnt balanced quite right in my opinion."

"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with long lasting, foamy white head. Aroma is of lemon zest, wheat malt and spices. Body is medium and crisp. A lot of spices, citrus fruit and wheat malt fill the mouth. Finish is medium and spicy. Nice Wit, I would buy it again."
"Tasty wit here. It's not groundbreaking but is smooth and goes down very easy and is pretty good all around. It is a tad watery but still good."
"I poured this yukkie beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a cloudy mess with a thin little wimpy head. The smell was like sour soup or something. The taste was sour also and just not good. It was all I could do to finish it off. Fruity flay tasting mess of a beer. They need to ditch that one. I will never buy or drink another."

"O/D-The flavor was pretty decent. It fulfills its niche in the variety pack."
""
"O: I'm a bit pleasantly surprised here - I came in expecting to dislike it as much as I do the Summer Ale, but it's actually decent. I don't think I'd buy a 6 pack of it should they be made available, though."
"Overall- A pretty nice version of a witbier, but nothing to exceptional."
"Pours hazy brownish gold. Murky with white foam layer. Minor orange peel nose, citrus. Grains of paradise nose reminiscent of the Sam Summer Ale as well. Taste is a light citrus, then wheat, finish with an orange citrus tang. Smooth and chalky mouthfeel. Tart remains on the tongue. Nice beer."
""
"Pours a cloudy medium golden with a fluffy white head. Good retention and a very nive lacing. Aroma is of wheat, orange, and spices. Body is crisp, and I would say the very light side of medium. Taste is of ale, and spice with orange & lemon zest in the finish. Very nice, although they appear to be the same brew, I liked the White Christmas a bit better...."
""
"Overall - Not a very flavorful brew, but what this witbier lacks in flavor, it makes up for in a light, refreshing drinkable quality. Maybe it's because I got a light workout in before review, but this thing is really hitting the spot. Probably would have been better mixed in with the Sam Summer pack, and not the Spring pack that comes out before the snow has even thawed."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet, best before June 2013. This pours a hazy golden yellow with an okay off white head which has decent retention. The smells are nice and citrusy, full of orange peels and spices. The feel is medium. The taste is decent, you get a little bitter orange along with mild hops and some malts."
"Easy to drink. I dig this beer. Good price too. I'd pick this up if you have a chance!"
"Overall: Minus the GoP, it's not particularly distinguishable from a Blue Moon, and, after Summer and Coastal Wheat, I'm really not sure they needed another light, wheat-based, Grains of Paradise-dosed anything."
"O - An Americanized Witbier. Similar to their Summer Ale, but with a fuller mouthfeel. I found myself enjoying it but why would I buy this over nearly identical offerings by SA, or other better Witbiers? A decent effort, but not a rebuy."
""
""
"O: Not great, not bad either, kind of good I guess? Drinkable at least. Just unimpressive."
"Not the most yeast influenced Witbier by any means but not bad at all. Expect a lot of orange and lemon peel feel here."
""
"O: Pretty good Witbier, but nothing too special. Above average."
""
""
""
"Had this in a variety pack at a Super Bowl Party. Feels like more of a summer drink but, oh well. Pours a hazy orange-gold colour with a foamy head that quickly gives way to thin lacing. Smells like fruit and citrus, heavy wheat notes. The taste is just ok. It does not taste like a standard wit, it's a little too heavy on the citrus. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and a tad bit thin. Kinda like seltzer was added. It's actually a pleasant drink. Easy to drink, but its not very memorable. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it's fine to discover in the variety pack."
"O: This wit is good for its own reasons. It won't taste like many of the other wits out there that have more Belgian phenolic tones, but it is done very nicely. It has more of an American take on the style, with more citrus and less yeast characteristics. I would have liked more carbonation and a bigger head. Despite its shortcomings, it is better than some of the average wits I've had."
""
""
""
"Taste is both spicy and sweet -- a different take on the usual Belgian wit vibe. The citrus and coriander work well together in tandem here, and this is an enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
"Poured out as a slightly hazy orange color with a white head on top. The head was white, had a thin retention and not much lacing. The smell of the beer is lightly spiced with a fruity character and some citrus. The taste is pretty good. There is a bit amount of fruit and sweetness in the flavor, subtle spice and a wheat finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied with a nice carbonation. Overall it's not a bad Witbier, reminded me of Sunset Wheat personally."
"Pours a deep orange with a foamy white head that fades. Smell is subtle sweet with a healthy dose of lemon. Taste is lemony with a slight peppery feel, subtle sweet, has some citrus before a huge lemon kick. A lighter mouthfeel slightly crisp. Overall a bit too much lemon but a decent brew."
""
"O: Too fruity for me, lacks balance. More of a summer ale. Would be better with cook out food, to sweet on its own, at-least it doesn't lack flavor. Middle of the pack from Sam Adams, at best."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it doesn't have a great flavor profile either. This comes across as a typical Americanized Witbier: big orange notes, some straw, and faint, almost unnoticeable spices. This was nice to try once, but I certainly won't be having it again."
""
"It pours a cloudy yellow/orange with low retention and lots of bubbles initially that quickly dissapate. It has a citrus aroma with a little Belgium yeast scent in there. It tastes crisp and refreshing and a little bready upfront and then it is all citrus I'm the finish. It has a slightly above average mouthfeel and good carbonation. This would be a great beer on a hot day."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head. Nose is peaches, straw, bread. Palate is very stingy, tongue lashing, with a light felt finish. Lightly sweet with flavors of peaches, pepper, light spiciness and bread. Dry finish with just a touch of umami. Like it."

"Pours a slightly hazy medium apple juice with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates to wisps of foam on top. The aroma is heavy on the orange and a bit spicy with coriander and a hint of fruity spicy wheat. The flavor is malty orange with a spicy edge. Its a bit sweet with light sugar and fruity malt and a bit of spice. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Decent beer, I could drink it, but I'm not sure I would want to it just not my thing."
""
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a prominent wheat/bready yeast flavor that overpowers the peppery spice and citrus sweetness. Slightly zesty with coriander, ginger and white pepper notes followed by hints of blood orange, tangerine and grapefruit but the bread and banana flavors are too strong for my liking, making it a bit one dimensional. Very easy to drink but could use more spice and citrus flavor."

""

""
"I don't mind this, at all. I thought I might turn on it, but I can drink it pretty easily and it tastes decent. I hate when brewers make their wheat ales undercarbonated, sticky, and body-hefty. This one drinks like a summery ale, but with agreeable cool weather spiciness."

"Edit-just realized it was a wit, not a hefe. My review is skewed, but the impression of the taste still stands. I simply may not be a wit beer guy."

"O: An easy-drinking wit with a fairly simplistic aroma and taste. Far from the complex Belgians that I'm used to. It's not bad by any stretch, but a little too simple for the style"
""

"O - The smell is inviting. The taste is fairly simple, but good. The feel would be better with lower carbonation. White Lantern is an ok wit."

"Overall it's decent but isn't my favorite wit nor my favorite from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
"Overall an OK beer. Another one of Boston Beers wheat beer experiments."
"Overall I thought this was an OK beer and an above average example of the style, the taste and aroma were very true to style and were much more intense then most, but the appearance and mouthfeel brought this beer down. This didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, but the flavors lost my interest quickly and combined with the sweeetness they would become too much for me to drink multiples. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style the aroma and taste were, they were just what I expect from the style and a little more intense then most. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was too thick with not enough carbonation, if those were fixed I think it would help the drinkability a little. I wouldn't buy this beer again on it's own, it's a good for what it isn't but it isn't something that I have the urge to buy again, but i do recommend giving it a try if your a Witbier fan and this might make a good choice for you Blue Moon drinking friends. All in all I thought this was a solid Witbier, it had some good aspects and some bad aspects, but it sill came together alright and I would rather have this than a Blue Moon. Another solid beer from Samuel Adams, the kings of solid beers."
"Might be good on a really hot day when you a light beer with some citrus to quench your thirst."

"A new Sam Adams brew....this one is yellow-gold and hazy. The head is bright white, but not long-lived. It's aroma is of wheat twang, citrus, and spice. It is a little muted, especially compared to the flavorful taste. Soft, sweet, and wheat. It has a subtle spice, and a fullness that is enjoyable. Very nice beer."

"It pours a beautiful hazy gold with a white head. The head has nice retention. lacing doesn't really kick in until there is just a thin layer of foam atop the beer. The aroma is full of intense orange and the tangerine is noticeable. Corriander and malt are definitely present as well. The taste pretty follows the aroma. lots of orange and hints of malt. The corriander kind of gets lost among teh muck here, as it is slightly citrusy. It has a moderate mouthfeel, although it is refreshing. The carbonation is light and relatively gentle. I love it. It's not too simple and it's not so complex that you get lost in a jungle of aroma and flavor. This beer knows what it is. Highly recommended."

"Overall, i guess this wobbly pop is ok, easy to drink, and easy on the wallet (unless u live in cali appearantly). I guess what my problems with this (and other recent SA selections) is that its obviously brewed for the masses, forced into stores waaaay too early (its still jan.in New England and spring beers are better in spring), and ever since SA got rid of the White Ale, every seasonal 12er has some lame attempt at originality. Stick with what git u there Jim."

"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's Spring mix pack. Pours a hazy light yellow body with nearly an inch of white head. Coriander dominates the aroma, with citrus and pith and citrus. Lemon, orange, pith, and a fair bit of spice toward the finish of the flavor. Light in body and carbonation. Not bad. A decent example of the style."
"OVERALL: Not a bad beer here, the flavors are fresh and not artificial tasting. I normally don't like to draw comparisons to other beers in reviews but the flavor here is very similar to Magic Hat #9. A crafty fruit beer with a wheat base. This is a gateway beer to lead the masses to craft. Even as a seasoned beer drinker, I have to say this isn't too shabby."
