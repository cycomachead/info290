"This is an exemplary example of an under-appreciated style.   Wheat, citrus, and coriander all present and in awesome balance."

"Go to wit on a warm day. Nice zest, not too much banana."
"Tasty interpretation. On tap. Lemony banana nose, hazy creamy yellow pour with  nice fine head that leaves rings on the shaker glass a I drink. Creamy mouthfeel. Light wit with nice coriander spice, lemon and light malts. Very nice."
""
"Overall, really nice wit."
""

"Very smooth, nice spices, nothing overwhelming or stealing the show.  Solid  would revisit."

"6-pack cans for $7.99 at my local shop, a deal that will have me going back for another 6er soon.  Smooth citrus wheat ale, very drinkable in cold and warm weather.  Nice mellow aftertaste reminiscent of a German wheat."
""
"Can pour. Have had this beer many times and it is a good go-to Wheat ale. Coriander and a hint of salt comes through amongst the bready yeastiness. Light orange comes into the mix, and makes this a refreshing beer that lends itself well to warm weather months."

"One of the better wits I've had. Pale straw color. Big banana aroma. I like that the taste is mostly spice coriander and orange. Not much banana at all."

"Excellent example of the style."

"Pale golden yellow with a bubbly, off-white topping.  Lemen and wheat to the nose.  A bit metallic.  Tastes of coriander of course, with lemon, faint grapefruit and a little orange.  Smooth but has a chalky aftertaste.  A simple, yet fairly tasty reminder that the basics can still be fun."

""
""
"Good clean finish.  Not too heavy."

"Clouded golden apricot body looks great wispy bright egg shell white head, fine speckled lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma has heavy yeast driven and spicy notes of coriander and orange peel additions. The yeast notes and spice additions combine into this chalky, citric, chamomile tea like quality. Flavor has soft bitterness that tastes floral, spicy coriander, citric notes, lavender herbal quality very complex well made witbier maybe too much spice for some witbier drinkers but in my opinion it stays balanced. Mouthfeel, I've enjoyed every Revolution beer I've tasted so far, the textures here are perfect slightly creamy edge from the wheat additions, spicy adds a nice dry finish with some upfront wheat notes, bitter orange peel levels the malt layers out as well. A great food and drink beer, this would pair well with so many different dishes rosemary/garlic braised lamb, white fish, any chicken dish. Overall a complex refreshing well executed witbier canned in Chicago."

"This witbier really got me thinking about the warm weather months ahead. Although the finish was a bit strange, I really enjoyed the intensity of this beer and would rank it as one of the better examples of the style."

"O: refreshing but a little harsh in it's delivery. Not a standout but a decent wit."

"Served in a clear plastic cup at the Chicago French Market. Beautiful golden color and good effervescence. Refreshing and easy drinking like a macrobrew but with more of a backbone. I couldn't pick out any flavor aside from ""beer"" but it was definitely hearty and satisfying. Couldn't really taste any spices at all."
""
""
""
""

"O- Not the greatest fan of wit beers; I suppose I just prefer the comparative heartiness of full-on wheat beers. As for this beer, I felt I came to enjoy it the more I drank it - refreshing and effervescent. Certainly one of the better wit beers I've tried and better than Hoegaarden in my book."
""
"O: I tend to go for Belgian Strong and Wit beers so I, no doubt, am a bit biased but I could definitely keep coming back for more of this one. That being said, there are other ones out there that I think I like a bit more."

"This Wit certainly did not blow me away, although this style will rarely do that to me. I thought it was appropriate, maybe a little soft on the Wit flavors, while that wheat malt really stands out on the palate."
""
""
"O: Good witbier, I dig the cans, but in the end not the best bang for your buck."
""

"The mouthfeel is great. Light-medium bodied, very refreshing. Carbonation slightly bites the tip of the tongue."

"Thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of lemons, a bit of spice. Taste is spices, lemons, some wheat, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and althought not the most flavorful wit out there, not a bad beer overall."

"The Crack was nothing notable, so I decided to spice things up with an inverted Glug. Oh, man, was that ever the right idea! It got everything in suspension out of suspension and the result looked like banana cream pie with meringue topping. Two fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with great retention sat atop a murky, yellowish liquid that looked like either freshly-squeezed grapefruit or banana pudding. Man, as a kid, I used to love instant banana pudding with real banana slices. I still love eating bananas. Yellow, amusing, tasty. Back to basics. The nose smelled like someone emptied the spice rack! I remember a Playboy cartoon as a kid where the guy is positioned to partake of some salmon and he looks upward with the caption being, ""I knew this was going to be good, but seeing a spice rack above your headboard ... !"" I did not get it at the time, but I do now. Gutes essen! Black pepper or lemon pepper was prevalent, but so was coriander and allspice. The first, and I hesitate to call it a sip, more like a draught, was big and full, not quite viscous, but getting there, and the spices were fantastic. I think that I caught some vanilla in the mix, rounding the edges. Man, but the spices were prevalent in this one. I used to love to cook as a teenager and I was probably better versed then than I am today, but this was like a spice melange. Finish, as you CAN probably imagine, was bone-dry. I felt like I had been licking alum this afternoon. All of that said, would I put in the cooler? Perhaps a few, depending on who was coming along. If it were just me, one might be enough."

"The Bottom Up is a decent Witbier. The beer poured a clear golden as I was careful not to pour a lot of settlement into my glass. The scent carries faint lemony citrus. The taste has some bitter characteristics that mesh well with the lemon flare. The mouthfeel is lighter in body and the carbonation is good. Overall it is a decent beer."

"Overall: Has a ton of the accents a nice summer beer should have. Nothing that blows you away, but through and through a rounded and pleasant beer."
"O-The combination of the off balance and the slight metallic taste ruined the beer."
"your classic American reincarnation of a Belgian wit. this one is a little heavy on both the coriander and the orange, but it works. bright yellow pour, almost looks like an electric hoegaarden, with similar haze and head. the nose is really herbal, and super yeasty. tons of lemon zest notes and sudsy spice from the Belgian yeast. flavor starts off with light wheat malt, followed by bitter and sweet orange peel alike, and finally a super herbal wash from toasted coriander seeds and maybe even fresh coriander, its potent. low alcohol but tons of body on this one, a little heavier than the style asks for, and isn't as sessionable as a result. good carbonation though, and a light soapy texture to its long finish. two of these was plenty, as its just a tad filling. nothing way out here, just a good American tip of the cap to the Belgian witbier. this one is more robust than most."

"As the dust settles, forget the bouquet-this, the floral-that. The authentic and rustic nature of Belgian-brewed wheat beers is alive and well in this Chicagoland rendition- and the beer world is better of for it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The slightly sweet beer has a nice perceived dryness with the spice in the finish. This beer is refreshing and has a nice taste but it is a meal in a glass."

"O: A good wit, very accurate to the style with a pleasantly appealing citrus quality. Easy drinking and rather approachable."
""

"O- very nice wit. Lovely spring/summer ale very crisp with plenty of spice. Not overly light yet very refreshing. Cheers."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is likewise soft with a nice flow to it in a light body. It doesn't forsake crispness. This is a refreshing beer and well made to style."
""
""
""
"O - this is an easy drinking, light Wit beer that has a pleasant Belgian flavor and aroma. Great summer beer that I'd gladly consume in any season."
""
""
""
"Nice color and a white head (that falls quite quickly). Nose is good; bready and bubble gum. Flavor is smooth and consistent. Nice lemon tones that are a bit high. It all works though. Smooth feel. Very easy drinker. Nice job on a difficult style to produce."
""
"Overall/Comments: A very good representation of the style with a very nice flavor profile. Very refreshing and tasty. This would make an excellent summer beer! Classified as a Witbier at 4.5% ABV. Consumed 2-18-13."

"Soft bodied brew from start to finish. Toasty, wheaty, and yeasty. Not a lot of coriander and oranger peel flavors. Some banana peel. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"Unassuming, refreshing, crisp and clean. A delicious wit I would love to serve up in the warmer months."

"12 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours very hazy golden straw color with a small 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, light bubblegum, floral, earth, and yeast esters. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, orange zest, coriander, wheat, clove, bread, floral, pepper, light bubblegum, earth, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, light bubblegum, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A touch watery, but its not too bad. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good witbier. Nice flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours clear golden. Small head. Smells grainy,banana, some coriander and clove, sweet. Taste has that nice clean Belgian yeast, on the lighter side to match the appearance. This was pretty one dimensional but solid nonetheless. It's extremely drinkable and I can see myself buying it for a group of people on a warm summer day."
"O: An entirely serviceable wit."
""
""
"O: Not terribly exciting, but not my favorite style either. Glad to have tried it, but probably won't again. On the upside, a very cool can."
"O: Like I stated from the onset, Revolution brews some good shit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is another great canned creation that I would want to have again."
""
""
""
"I'm adding this one to my already growing list of good beers from this brewery."
""
"12oz can, pours golden with surprising clarity, mild haze. Thinner white head leaves a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are bready yeast, wheat, fruity belgian yeast, orange. Tastes are fruity, juicy fruit gum, wheat, yeast, clove, orange. Medium body, moderate carbonation, finishes nice & clean. Overall, pretty average here, but well put together."
""
"(O)- Overall, I quite like this. An easy favorite over something like Blue Moon, particularly since it is made locally."
"This beer also has a really nice rich mouthfeel. its great."

"O: A very good wit beer and will def get this again"
"Revolution is a brewery you can really get behind. All their beers are very good, and they know their food as well. This is a dangerously drinkable Wit. Chugable even! Funky hay smell with a taste of bread and candied orange zest. The balance is really what makes this beer. My only gripe is the cost, because you can just polish these off! Was it Marx who said opiates are the beer of the masses??"
""

"O: This is a perfectly quaffable summer Wit beer. Can't wait to see how it fares during the colder fall/winter Chicago months."

"So, does only one person get to drink then...? Anyway, this stuf pours a lightly hazy pale brass topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises coriander, light black pepper, cracked wheat, lemon zest, orange zest, and a touch of cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, with those orange tones really pulling their weights here. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally crisp (if still a touch wet) finish. Overall, a very nice, very refreshing little witbier."

"I've heard servers tell people this beer is ""Like Blue Moon for grown-ups"". I enjoy the mild spiciness and citrus notes, but I occasionally get a sulfidic ""twang"" in the back of the throat following my first few gulps. I've noticed this more when the beer is really fresh. It's appearance when freshly tapped looks more like pale OJ than a beer, other than the wonderful froth that sticks around for quite some time. When in this state, the yeast is almost too much, and contributes to the aforementioned twang. Their beer always seems fresh (probably because it is), but this one benefits from sitting in the tank a few extra days. Ask the bartender if it's a new batch or not prior to committing to 16 oz. When I've ordered it outside the Logan Square brewpub (which it's starting to pop up in several other spots) this hasn't been a problem."
"O: A decent witbier, but I would pass on it given another opportunity. The mouthfeel really did it in for me and the flavors were kind of muted."
"The mouth is slick with midlevel carbonation. I think this a pretty good example of the style and I would have no problem repeating this one."
"Pours a very hazy yellowish color with a bit of gold to it. Nice white head and a bit of lacing as it falls. The nose is really nice and does a superb job hitting all the hot points in the style with a great wheat base along with some nice orange and a slight bit of coriander. Great balance between everything. The taste is the same, offering a bit of sweetness and the perfect amount of coriander and citrus peel to complement. Good body; a bit creamy. Drinks quite well. I really enjoyed this. One of the better wits I've had in a long time."
"Very good for the style overall. Highly drinkable."
"Overall, very good my favorite Revoltuion beer."
"D - Easy to get down and order more. Nothing overpowering that makes this one hard to drink after a while. Would definately get it again."
"Much like the other Revolution beers which I have sampled to this point, I can only describe this as unique. Someone below me said this before I could say it, but it does seem like a fairly modern twist which has a decent classic backing. Some may disagree with me, but I found the coriander to be the defining element of this beer. It makes this beer both lively and unique. It may not be for everyone, but I found it enjoyable; definately try it once if you're looking for an interesting interpretation of the style."
"Very good beer. No complaints. We had some at the brewery and then took a growler of this home. Get some."
"Flavor was more punchy with light orange peel, and a supple mellow feel from the wheat. It finished dry with a mildly tart citrus peel note in the background. Not too heavy or phenolic as some Wits can be, it was nicely balanced, and a touch on the bigger side. Mellow carbonation, with a soft mouthfeel. The flavors really shined in this Wit, and i've had a few in my day that I can say it stands out from the rest. Definitely traditional with a slightly amped up edge."
