"Uplifting spritsy taste, almost like champagne."
""
"The classic wheat beer.  There is a reason this is the standard for the style."
""
""
"Almost no better beer for warm weather. Effervescent. Cloudy. Slightly spicy phenols from the yeast and coriander and orange peel. Refreshing with a capital R"
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer for the style, easy to drink, can't wait for summer"
""
"Almost perfect Beer from Maine"
""
""
""
"The head on this beer is so dense, it's reminiscent of latte foam. The smell and lingering taste of coriander and orange make it very enjoyable to sit, savor, and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As a beer i wouldnt say its amazing, but it sure is for the style, thus the reason for my fairly high rating. Its bright and effervescent, smooth and refreshing yet somewhat full. It really could be the benchmark for an American made witbier"

""

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Light, refreshing and lightly spicy. Good session Belgian."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"White pillow like head. Bright yellow hazy yellow. Mild bitterness. Soft yeast taste. A crisp subtle and well balance. Mild banana lemon like aroma."
"One of my favorite American beers and a masterpiece of the white beer style"
""
""
""
"Overall: A good witbier, solid in every aspect. I'm a fan."
""
""
""
"One of the best out there. Try to get on draft if you can find it."
""
""
"Not a fan of witbiers, and this was no exception."
""
"Tastes a little bitter, similar to other Belgium wheat beers."
""
""
""
"Great white ale. Perfect any time of year."
"Overall: A classic brew, an interesting take on a classic style.  The added spices enhance the yeast flavors, rather than detract.  Love it.  Very refreshing as well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this on tap in philly.  This is a great tasting beer on tap.  I didn't think bottled version was as aromatic."
""
""
"Amazing.  The perfect example of an American brewed Belgian wheat beer."
"Nice golden color, smells a sweet pungent aroma but the taste is not as strong as the scent and I enjoyed that. I expected it to have a higher ABV than 5.1, but that doesn't effect it at all"
""
"Coriander, lemonade and banana, with bitter hints and a little pepper in the end, Very well balanced, refreshing, excellent Witbier, with a clean ending."
"Very good beer. I got the four pack and loved every bit of it. So good."
""
""
"""Probably the best Belgium white I have ever tasted"" - my roomate"
""
"The was a hard beer to review for me because I haven't had any in this style in quite some time.  It was  a very pale and cloudy yellow with a white head that clinged too the pint glass as I drank it. Very mild aromas, mild fruit and floral hints (not what I would describe as ""fruity"") and blended flavors, very good feel.  Finishes with a low level hop bitter that fades quickly.  Crisp and light, could easily drink these in multiples."
"This is my favorite white beer so far. Great refresher in the summer or after a hard day at work. The spices in this are unlike any other white beer i have had. This Is a beer almost everyone can enjoy."

"mouth feel was somewhat champagne-like, Though I only noticed after my wife mentioned it, so perhaps it was just power of suggestion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured in to a tall decorative tulip glass, the foam reaches 3 fingers high with a rocky white top. Exceptional lacing adorns this straw yellow wit, a fitting touch for such a good looking brew. It is remarkably hazy & totally opaque, in spite of the pale color. The scent is intoxicating, rivaling some of its finest German and Belgian brethren. Banana-like esters, coriander and clove play against a sourdough bread bouquet. Very mildly sweet, with flavors of banana candy, peppered clove, and some tart lemon citrus on the back end. Grains of wheat, orange citrus and some tangy, dry bitterness in the finish. The beer is surprisingly creamy due to the zesty carbonation and unfiltered goodness. However, the body is moderate, so it remains refreshing. This one went down in record time. It's just fantastic. Wits are typically not my proverbial cup of tea, but this one holds its own against any style. It remains true to form while imparting its own distinct character. I love to come back to this after some hearty double stouts or rich porters, to remind myself that bold flavor comes in many forms. If you're in to wheat beers at all, you have to try this. If you're not, you still have to try this."
""
""
""
"A classic. One of the first beers I got into to veer further into craft territory, and one I recommend to many others coming into it. Hazy, unfiltered on the pour with a creamy head. Lemon and fresh cut grass on the nose, with a tangy lemon curd feel on the backend."
""
""
""
""
"If you're skeptical of Belgians, try this Wit. Bready deliciousness"
""
""
""
"On tap at Le Belvedere in Newport, VT.  Hazy orange-yellow with a finger of pure white head that slowly dissipates.  Citrus and spice in aroma and taste.  Slightly thin mouth.  Overall, and enjoyable but not exceptional wheat beer."
""
""
""
"Classic tasty brew."
""
"Slightly sour taste as an honest ode to the German hefeweizen. Good spiced flavor. Good body."
""
""
"this is my go-to beer. Clear, light amber hues, light, inviting bubbles, beautiful and peaked head (pour after pour, every time)"
""
"Overall: Very polished Belgian Wheat beer. Feels light, but still has substantial flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is very good and definitely recommended for others, especially, if you're looking for something light that isn't hoppy. The beer is very refrshing and makes for a good mid-afternoon break."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good."
""
""
""
"A classic. A go-to session beer for easy drinking, for those who aren't into drinking 10% bombs, or for those who aren't into crazy and unexpected flavors."

"great witbier and one that really exemplifies the style. This is a heavily spiced beer- the spices are easily the most dominant part of the flavor in this one. It's not bad, but it takes some getting used to. Would recommend."
"Pours a light honey and blond color, with little head but good retention that remains as a thin white lace throughout.Look is also hazy.  Fruity smell that reminds me of peaches. Taste is malty, spicy, fruity, bready, with a very smooth finish. There is little to no hops bitterness. Feel is light bodied with a medium carbonation. Crisp and refreshing. A very fine wheat beer that I will definitely buy again."

"Overall (3.88) : It's not the ""world class"" beer I was expecting...that title still goes to Hoegaarden. This is a worthy option, though, and as I've said before, I'll never turn down a wit (unless it's Wasatch's offering). This one is different from the fold in that it's drier on the finish and it has some negative tin and biscuit flavors roaming around in there. Overall not a bad beer and one to enjoy in pleasure."

"One of my absolute favorites. Pours a hazy orange/ yellow with a thick fizzy head. The smell is full of sweet fruits like banana and toasted bread. The taste is great with a lot of herb flavors mixing with the more traditional staples. I always find this beer to be refreshing and very tasty."

"Great beer"
"A solid drinkable witbier perfect for any summer day"
""
"O: I've been enjoying this beer for quite a few years now and I was surprised to see that I had never reviewed it. As I stated above, this is an amazing, basically textbook example, of a Belgian Witbier and shouldn't be missed by anyone interested in the style. Perhaps the only thing missing is a touch of honey flavor, that would make it perfect in my opinion."

"O - Nice complexity here.  Piney finish was a bit of a surprise since the pine note is different than most Hefs that I have drank.  Pine works well with the banana and clove flavors.  Throughly enjoyed this beer.  4.25/5"

"Hard to find any faults here. Light in it's appearance but full of flavor.  A classic wheat beer."

"T: Considerably more complex than the aroma suggests. Banana and cloves, floral hops, scant lemongrass tartness, white pepper and coriander spicing, orange pith gives it a dry and tart character on the finish. Slight metallic, but a definite medicinal character builds as well."

"Beer appearance is a vibrant gold indicative of a white beer. Foam forms a good head during pouring. You can smell some fruity aromas coming from the beer during the first sips. It's a medium to light bodied beer with an aftertaste of signature Belgian yeast. To cut the story short, if you want a belgian beer and it's too hot to enjoy a darker beer, then the Allagash White is an excellent choice."

"Prickly on the tongue. Soft wheat character with a slow and growing dryness that really lays on the tongue. Ample carbonation leads to immediate gas. Still is a little cold, so I'll let it sit a bit and see if it opens up a little more. Softer spicing than in the aroma. This one is cleaner than most and spices takes less of a strong role in the overall flavor with more emphasis on the wheat character. To me it actually calls for a little fruit addition (something I would never have said a few years ago). A light tartness and sourness shows in time."

"O- Love this beer. Every time I finish one off I find myself yearning for more. This is flat out one of the best Wheat/Wit/White beers that I have ever had (maybe the best). It has a very complex flavor profile especially considering the style. Wish I could get it a little easier as they are tough to come by in my city."
""

"O: been many long years since I've had this... still as crazy cloudy as I remember - 'cloudy' ain't even the word - more pea soup 'murky'... it's solid, though it could be tilted a tiny touch more toward the spice, less naked yeast flavor"

Definitely a beer that I will go back to in the future. Smooth and easy to drink. Overall its a really good beer and lives up to the hype of it being one of Allagash's favorites."

""
"Allagash White pours a cloudy yellow color, with no head. There is an aroma filled with cloves and Belgian spices. The taste was similar, good clove flavors, lots of Belgian spices and candy flavors. Good full flavor, not overpowering, and good feel. Overall its a very nice drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent belgian white ale, packed with flavor."
""
""
""
"This is always a great go to. The Allagash Brewing company gets the lemon/citrus/coriander combination perfect. Made true to form all from the aroma to the soapy dishwater appearance. I only wish they would package them in 6 packs as opposed to 4s. Regardless, this is still one of my all time favorites!"

"Overall-this is a good beer. The coriander taste is a bit strong for me at first but as I continue through the beer, it's not as strong. I would recommend this beer as a fall beer as the flavor and smell fit that season very well. I prefer this beer to the fall seasonal pumpkin beers."
""
"O - I could easily go through a six pack of these, particularly in the warmer months. Normally I savor a beer for 20 or more minutes, and I drained this one in less than 10. Definitely wanted a second. Highly recommend."

"DATE TASTED: December 22, 2013... GLASSWARE: Konig-Pilsener weizen...OCCASION: Browns/Jets--a meaningless game? Not for a fan!... APPEARANCE: hazily unfiltered, tawny yellow body exhibits slow, steady carbonation; thin white head settles quickly; some tracings.. AROMA: lively lemon zest, allspice and honey greets the nostrils--more than pleasant, even (especially?) in winter... PALATE: soft as falling snow with a fizz that sounds the same; light and cleansing--highly drinkable; a satisfying, lingering aftertaste...TASTE: slightly malt; damp lemongrass with some intriguing spiciness--pepper and allspice--delicious; yeasty enough to hold attention and round complexity... OVERALL: I liked this so much, I gifted my wife's uncle with some for Christmas--and he agreed that this white is as formidable as we've encountered..."

"Over the past year, had 6 kegs of Allagash White, 1 keg of Allagash Black and a BBC Coffehouse Porter (very good) and we just can't shake Allagash White -- it's like crack cocaine!! This Christmas Eve we had family over with many wine drinkers and one older uncle who is sworn to Budweiser to the end of his days. Within an hour all were drinking Allagash White and asking for more. Need I say more?"

"O: Even though I'm slightly less amazed by this brew on my third time around, and I no longer consider it my favorite beer to date, it still holds the title of ""The Witbier to End All Witbiers"" in my mind. The flavors are borderline flawless, and the mouthfeel is one of the best I've experienced on any brew. Allagash truly hit a homerun with Allagash White, and this brew has set the standards by which I judge a Witbier."

"I can't believe I haven't rated this yet. So perfect. My go to for a perfect beer. I think the balance of wheat and citrus is perfect. Pours this typical yellowtail color with an ok carbonation and head. But the taste is so f...ing good. Allahash is one of many Maine breweries killing it. This beer is simply perfect"

"Overall for almost 4 bucks I can think of some cheaper offerings that match the quality. Kind of pissed since I ordered the Triple and got this but it's a tasty beer regardless."

"Pours light golden with a light head and lacing. The lacing diminishes in a few minutes. Light nose of Belgian yeast and spice. Average carbonation. A superb spiced beer of the Belgian wit style. Very crisp with a burst of spice - coriander and orange. Excellent hop balance to compliment the spices. Crisp finish and light mouthfeel in accordance with the style. One of my personal favorites. Appearance is slightly cloudy, as it should be. If you like spiced beer, it gets no better than this."

"Not necessarily my favorite witbier, but it is an excellent example of the style.

"the flagship beer for allagash, i have been drinking this one for as long as i can remember. i do like it better from the bottle than the tap though, an uncommon theme for me personally. it pours a real cloudy pale yellow color with an inch of soapy white head. hold the orange slice please, this isn't a schocktop. aromas of orange zest and light coriander seed waft up, but so does a nice bitter hopping and a density of wheat malt that is quite pronounced. the taste is the best of the nose, with the orange being subtle, sweet, and acidic. the body is full for the style, which i really like, and the Belgian yeast strain is just right for this brew. probably the best version of this style brewed in the entire untied states, certainly one of them. this is a staple beer for me, but i think it gets watery or contaminated via tap sometimes. the bottles are always perfectly carbonated, but the draft is hit or miss in my experience. it was epic on tap at the brewery though, so fresh and bright. this beer is an all around winner."

"o: The best of the few Belgian whites I have had, and probably the nicest of the floral/fruity summertime beers I've tasted, although this one is meant for year-round consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
"But this beer presents a dilemma. It's not distinctive enough to be ""special"" and too expensive to be ""everyday"". Hence the scores--they might have been a bit higher in isolation, but not when compared to other representatives of the style. I would prefer more yeast-forward variants and more subtle carbonation. But the mineral qualities make it particularly suitable for pairing with seafood (perhaps made with Maine lobster in mind)."

"At Avas in Easton from the bottle. Pours lemonade color with small head in a pint glass. Lemony yeasty spice aroma. Flavor follows exactly with a nice citrus and spice balance. Medium sweetness almost like some honey that gives this plenty of sweet refreshing flavor. Light easy drinking mouthfeel. Solid carbonation. One of my favorite wits for sure."

"This is legitimately one of my favorite beers to drink come summertime. I put pen to paper (actually it was on my phone notebook) at the Westin in Boston on this review in May of 2011, but I had my first Allagash in college and have never looked back. The fruity crispness, corriander, slight spice, and hazy appearance make you long to be sitting on your deck in July. The only small qualm I have with this beer is the mouthfeel, which is awfully soft, even for a witbier. Absolutely outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Wonderfully refreshing. Body makes this a somewhat substantial and nourishing beverage. Perfect for summer. For more head retention, try a larger percentage of wheat in the grist OR simply carb with more priming sugar or co2. Nearly outstanding."
""
"Overall: Given one of the first really nice days in Wisconsin, this beer was perfect to just relax on the porch with and watch the city live and breathe around me. This beer is what all other summer beers should strive to be, but it is also great enough that it could be enjoyed at any point in the year. Now the only problem is how I am going to get my hands on another bottle, since Allagash does not distribute to Wisconsin, yet. 17/20"
"Beautiful Witbier made by Allagash, with a charming orange-peel aroma, honey, coriander seeds, and, in a smaller scale, pepper and wheat ideas. The spiceness is more evident in the taste, that besides bringing the other elements of the aroma, displays a slight hop bitterness that is well-paired with the other characteristics. The light, relatively well carbonated body leaves such subtle hop bitterness at the end. I am absolutely fascinated by the quality of the Allagash White - I love it."

"O- a solid example of the style, mouthfeel was near perfect. Perhaps the best outside of Belgium."

"O - Not sure if this still the leader of the style but clearly a solid beer. A perfect beer to show those breaking in to craft beer that even the lighter styles can be eye opening."
"Cloudy, white ale with a foamy head that dissipated quickly. Left a slight lacing on the glass. Had a nice clean aroma where the spices really came through with a light fruity note in the background. Tasted matched the aroma only the citrus was more prominent. Overall this is a great, prototypical witbier that everyone can appreciate."

"Overall it's one of the better whites I've had--I'll enjoy this again."

"o a great white beer. not my favorite style but it is very well done."
"Solid, easily available and cheap."

"Pours an almost opaque color, fairly pale but pleasant looking. Lacing is light but noticeable and a film remains throughout. The smell is very sweet, of fruit - especially bananas and something else I am unable to distinguish. The smell is extremely satisfying. There is barely a hint of alcohol at all and there are notes of banana and cloves and even a little caramel. Despite the sweetness there is a fine balance with the hops. The carbonation is just right - not overpowering and not flat. One of the best beers I've had recently and Allagash White certain gives many European whites a run for their money."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – A very easy drinking and all around good witbier."
""
""

"Light to medium bodied with above average carbonation. There is a light citrus aftertaste, and this beer is incredibly easy to drink. I would definitely like to try this again if I get the chance."
""
""
"Poured nicely with a little head (less than one finger). The picture was taken about 1 minute after pouring. Appearance is cloudy, but pleasant yellow. It looks like what I’d expect from a wheat beer. I got a lot of lemon and coriander when I first smelled it. On first sip, you definitely get the coriander. It’s not overwhelming, but it’s not overly simple either. It’s a nicely balanced beer. I’m also getting a little bit of clove, and the more that I drink it and the citrus flavors definitely come out. It’s got a nice carbonation to it and I could see easily putting away a bunch of these while sitting on a patio on a summer night."

"I would say that this is the best Witbier I have had thus far. The spices and citrus fruit flavor is well balanced and the mouthfeel is nice and light. Maybe a little rough up front, but when you start to take in all of the flavors its really nice. It's a good summer beer and one that can be paired with all kinds of cuisine."

""
"Allagash White was the first witbier I ever had. I've had a number of witbiers in the past few years, but nothing has ever topped this. It's not my favorite style, but this is absolutely the best I've ever had of this style. Hence, a 5 overall."

"This pours a cloudy straw gold color with thin foam. Big yeasty and estery aroma that has some coriander, orange peel & floral notes. This has a pleasurably crisp and estery flavor that’s light and delicate with a wheated sweetness on the palate. Definitely enjoyable and a steal for the price."
""
""
""
"O-not sure if I can think of a better beer on a hot summer day. It's so refreshing, quite amazing for a witbier. Definitely much better than the others I've had. "

"Growler fill from GBX. Poured to a pint glass. Pale straw pour with with nice 2 finger white head. Interesting looking beer, very unique color, cloudy and light. Smell is mild lemon and honey. A little coriander and yeast. Taste is a bit bolder with a front end that is sweet. Notes of cloves, citrus and lemon that give way to a bit of spice and zesty pepper. Well balanced and complex. A touch of hops at the end to stablize the tart front. Feel is nice and light with a decent amount of carbonation. Overall- A very nice take on the style with the zesty finish and unique look. Like the blend of tart and spicy. A very refreshing summer brew that gets better as it warms. Like the hints of honey and citrus. Will hit this again-"

"O - This is an awesome witbier. Fits the style nearly perfectly. My only complaint is the appearance. I’m not sure if it’s because I didn’t pour aggressively enough or served it too cold, but head formation, retention, and lacing were all disappointing for a wheat-based beer. Nevertheless, this is a terrific beer. It smells, tastes, and feels great and is very drinkable and refeshing. What more can you ask for?"

"O-tasty Wit with good blend of flavors, refreshing summer brew"

"O: A good Wit, refreshing and drinkable."

"The Allagash White had everything I'm looking for in a summer beer. It's very light in color, yet almost opaque. The beer is very citrus-y, yet not overwhelmingly fruity. The taste is great but the smell might be even better. The perfect beer for cooling off on a hot summer day."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Insanely drinkable, I could easily have had another. A really great example of a witbier - deep in flavor, but still just as light and crisp and clean as you would expect in a Wit. Went really well with the pizzas I had. I cannot wait to try again someday."

"not as impressive as I hoped but holds its own weight. if you want a high end summer brew this has your name written all over it. but as for me, this is only marginally better than some of. the other mass produced summer favorites. don't think I'd get it again. bit then again I'm jot a big fan of Belgian wits to begin with. to be fair though, this is still a pretty good beer."

"This is a decent beer. It is to style, it has the better of the styles characteristics, but it doesn't have the more spicy, peppery notes that I like in my Witbier. If this is you're style then this is a good example of the traditional Belgian style."
""
""
""
"Had on tap. Poured into a pint glass. Lovely light colored straw appearance with a fluffy head. This is the perfect summer beer. It's easy drinking, but perfectly executed wit. Which is why it is so enjoyable. I could drink this all day. Thinking about swing over to the craft store and getting a couple extra bottles for home later."
""
""
""
"Overall a good rendition of a witbier, admittedly not among my favorite styles."
""
""
""
""
""

"a fine brew that's worth seeking out. i'm not crazy about wittes but this one is special, and definitely would be an instant hit among the saison lovers."
""
"O: My favorite wheat based beer still, complex, light, flavorful but not overwhelming, absolutely awesome. This beer will always hold a special place in my heart. It taste better out of a 750 (that you drink by yourself out of the bottle)."

"Overall - Very light and the flavours are fairly subdued. The mouthfeel is perfectly fitting for the style, very light and lively. I was expecting a little more taste, but the flavours are delicious. I've been wanting to try this one for a while and while it isn't mind blowing, I can see why it's one of the higher rated beers within the style."
""
"o: one of the best whites out there."
""
""
"Overall- a great beer."
""
"O: the is most definitely the best witbeer out there, easily sessionable and yet so complex and delicious"

"O: A great beer to drink as it starts to warm up for spring. Light yet complex. I wish it were distributed to Ohio."

"O: This beer is greater than the sum of parts and is a very well made example of the style. Solid, no flaws and easy drinking."

"O: An easy drinking and funky wit. Quite tasty."
""

"O: Very refreshing and super easy to drink, this beer reminds of summers watching baseball and grilling in the yard. This is a great summer session beer and a very nice example of the style. I have had this beer many times and likely will continue to have it regularly this summer as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is my ideal witbier. I compare all others in the style to this beer. I love to drink this beer. It is the most refreshing beer I can think of, and is complex and delicious as any other. I love it so much in summer time, but I'll drink it any day."
""
""
"O: This was very light and refreshing. Would make a great warm-weather drinker."
"Light body but creamy due to the carbonation and yeast. Refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is probably one of my favorite Witbiers. Bottle-fermented, this brew pours a cloudy off-white, typical of the genre. It has a yeasty bouquet the prepares you for what follows. The mouth feel is slightly chunky and the taste is bready with the distinctiveness of the wheat coming through along with fruit tones like banana. This is a very well-balanced and enjoyable wit. Highly recommended."

""
""
""
""
""

"From a growler the beer pours a light hazy yellow with a good pure white head. I used an Allagash ale glass for this brew. The smell yeasty and breadlike. The scent is subtle. The taste follows the scent and is a bit lighter than I would have thought, but this is a clean, refreshing brew that would be near perfect for a hot summer day. The mouth feel is light and bubbly. Just an explosion of tiny bubbles across the tongue. This is a very nice witbier and a must for the summertime."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a weisse vase, the beer is an unfiltered, almost opaque, pale, lemon yellow coloring with a fluffy, white, foamy, chunky head. Aromas are light and well blended, with clove spicing highlighting bready and banana characteristics. Smells really good. Flavors are smooth and rich, with a subtle sharpness from the carbonation. Bready, clove, pepper, and oregano spicing all form a solid backbone, with banana sweetness layering the flavor profile. Very well balanced. Tremendous flavors that are not overpowering. There is a low, smooth fruit and spice aftertaste, leading to a slightly spicy sharp finish that cleans the palate. You won't find many better Wits than this, especially stateside. Tasty!"

"o - a solid beer overall and enjoyable, especially on this unseasonably warm march evening. maybe lacking the depth and complexity of some of it's european counterparts. not a huge wheat beer fan but i'd certainly pick up more of this if allagash didn't pull out of michigan."
""
"Pours to a generous head and ample lacing with the pour/swirl/pour method. Cloudy yellow. Aroma is heavy on the spice with the lemony/peppery coriander coming in over all others. Flavor is tang and spicy with a soft malt and wheat finish that leaves behind the spice. Mouthfeel is light-medium, really nice for the style--not too gassy. Overall a tasty beer for those who are into the coriander side of things in witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell and taste were clean & crisp and went very nicely with my veggie sandwich. It also was great as a after lunch drink. Even the one who brewed himself thought that it was a nice refreshing beer for spring & thought it might be paired well with cheesem"
""
""
""
"O: Quite good among the Witbiers. It would be a close competition with Hoegaarden, but I'd give Allagash a slight edge."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's no wonder why so many consider this beer to be the benchmark American-made Witbier. Rated to style or otherwise - brewed in Belgium or not - this beer is fantastic."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a pale cloudy yellow with a big, fine white head and lacing. Very nice looking. Light aroma of wheat and Belgian wheat beer spicing. A hit of sulphur at first. Taste is great, wheat, yeast, clove and a hint of lemon. Finishes a bit sweet, without the residual spice astringency in many wheat beers. A very nice, pleasant witbeer. Hope to try again."
""

"O - Took me awhile to get around to this one, and it does not disappoint. A highly satisfying and drinkable witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color with a frothy white head. Big creamy mouthfeel with exceptional smoothness. Big banana and coriander nose. Almost butter like quality in texture. Tropical fruit rind bitterness with some detectable clove spiciness. sweet fruit and bread flavors balanced not by the hops but rather the spice. Refreshing but with an almost yeast bite like finish. Some detectable banana up front as well. Semi sweet aftertaste but overall pretty good. The only problem is that it comes in 4 packs. Id pay 9 bucks for the sixer but 9 for the 4? Oh well."
""
""
""
""
"Poured with a great white head and retains some nice lacing. Apppearance is that of a golden yellow that is definitely thick and hazy. Smell is the least interesting quality. I couldn't destinguish much other than a sour citrusy note. Tasted great, with all sorts of citrus notes, and a nice dry finish. The carbonation lends nicely to the mouthfeel, which helps this beer feel the way it looks. Overall I really enjoy this beer as a great casual drink. I could have a few more, easy."

"-Overall 3.5: A very good beer for this style, but ultimately I did not find it to be outstanding. I imagine it would be wonderful on a hot, summer's afternoon."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Chunky rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, yeast, and spices. Taste is of wheat, yeast, and spices along with a slight perfume flavor that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I honestly expected more from this one."
""
""
"Very good beer. Poured very good into the glass and was simply fabulous going down. A little bland opposed to a Hoegaarden. Honestly, I would say it tasted much better and fuller than a St. Bernardus Witbier. I would recommend this beer for anyone who loves Witbiers."
""
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this is a great all-purpose beer. The body is just thick enough to allow the flavors to pop and to prevent the carbonation from being too pushy. The carbonation is a bit fizzy, which is to be expected of the style, but does not seem to help much in the swallow."
"Hazy dark yellow color with a thin off-white head. Very little lacing. Aroma is very spicy with pepper, coriander and some citrus. Light-bodied and crisp with a spicy and fruity character, with yeast flavor as well. The finish is sweet, fruity and clean."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet. This pours a hazy yellow with a medium sized white head. The smells are of Belgian yeast esters, sweet malts, wheat. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is good, although this style is lighter than I like, a little wheat, some yeast esters, a hint of spice."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid witbier from Allagash. I have come to enjoy this beer more and more every year. Bottle or draft and this beer hits the spot."
""
""
""
"O- I read about this beer and spent about two months searching beer stores trying to grab a bottle or two. The beer was very impressive as well as my first Allagash. Was very impressed and cant wait to experience more from the brewery in Portland, ME."
""
"Drinkability- This was very good. I loved it. I will have more. You can bet on it!"
""
""
"O: good beer but overrated. The carbonation wasn't nearly as much as needed to create a nice creamy wit beer head. Also no corriander or orange peel taste. Would drink if on special."
"The beer is a cloudy honey yellow with ample effervescence and lacing. It smells like fruit and honey, absolutely decadent. The taste is no different, with a wheat sweetness and yeast fruit character pulling this beer up to world class witbier status. This is definitely not gluten free. There is nothing strange or unexpected with the mouthfeel compared to how well the beer has done thus far. Honey and citrus fruits predominate my palate. Overall this was an incredible find and I'm glad to have grabbed a few to both cook with and sip on. It's definitely well received by those helping me drink it."

""
""

"Overall, a solid beer and good example of the style. Another winner from Allagash."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is an awesome beer that is new tasting, and I feel it is able to be had many times while discovering new things about it."
""
"O- A classic beer as an alternative for those not acclimated with craft brews. To me this is the best ""light"" beer I have had."
""
"Came in a four pack of stubby brown bottles, for 8,99$ in Windham, ME. Worth it. What a beer, this would make me proud if I were American, even more if I were a Mainer. Pretty beer, sexy head and awesome body. A smell that is reminiscent of the best of Belgian Witbiers, and a taste that will not let you down, and a mouthfeel according to the levels of this taste and smell. Smooth and not as light as it seems. Worth every single penny I payed of this four pack. Legendary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I see where it gets it's world class label, definitely in my top 5 wits, but not at the top of the list. DFH Namaste still has it beat IMO. Prost!"
""
""
"Pours a mostly transparent yellow color with a one finger head. Head quickly receedes, lots of quickly rising carbonation visible in the body. Smell is light, but I get some citrus and phenols. Taste starts with a smooth sweetness, then I get a tickle of carbonation, a bit of orange in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit on the lighter side. Overall, a great beer, stands up will in a world of double IPAs with a nice balance between simplicity and complexity. It is certainly a refreshing change."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, this goes down easy. In fact, it goes down too easy...I could seriously down an entire 4-pack of this in one sitting. Not the most in your face beer on the market, but an awesome summertime drink."

"o – Overall great belgian wheat beer for those who tend to like mild, fruitier notes"
""
""
"I dunno how they get away with charging the prices they do for some of their beers. Outside of the massive coriander dosage, the beer is only slightly better than the BMC type of clone beers aimed at this type of market."
"o - Overall this is a great witbier. For the price and availability, I think it's even better. I like the nose a little more than the taste as the taste has a little more spice and the nose a little more citrus, but both are good. Have had this many times and will certainly have it again, I think this would also be a good beer to introduce to non-craft beer drinking people to."
""
""
"Side note: my waiter said that this is like a better version of Blue Moon. I agreed saying that Allagash has sould, and Blue Moon is made in enormous batches by Coors. I added that they sell Blue Moon as the non-challenging alternative to better made whites."

"D/O: A really nice, traditional Belgian witbier; very refreshing, smooth and easy drinking. Really good stuff. Takes 2nd place to Hitachino Nest White, but those two are head and shoulders above the rest!"
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Incredibly drinkable. An amazing witbier. Very flavourful and complex for the style. Affordable as an import considering its high quality."
""
"Overall: excellent witbier (best I've had yet) that leans to the spicy side, extremely refreshing and ""drinkable."" Session beer? I still prefer German weizens when it comes to wheat beers but I would take this over all but the top tier weizens."

"A great Witbier. One of the best. Highly recommend."

""

"Allagash White pours an extremely pale yellow color. Light aroma is rather yeasty. I like the creamy smooth mouthfeel on this beer, soft and delicate. The body is soft and velvety smooth with a delicately tingly carbonation level. It's light and extremely drinkable, with the balance tipped slightly toward the bitter side of the scale. The peppery hops character is noticeable, but not overbearing, and it doesn't hang around on the palate, which is a good thing given the style of a wit. Overall, this is probably one of the best wits I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: it seems to be getting better numbers every time I come back to this, still not 100% sold on this one, but it still fits the style."
""
""
"O: Top of the witbier category for me. Flavors are well defined but perfectly balanced. Super drinkable. As perfect a witbier as I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Despite my ratings, I have to give this a 4. There are a lot of other great beers in this category that are either cheaper, or edge this out in flavor. It's just too pricey for me to consider picking up again."
"Big thanks to Jerz for this one"
""
""
""
""
"O - Not terribly familiar with the style, but this beer is smooth, drinkable, tasty, and looks nice. I enjoyed it. Some of the best lacing I've seen yet as well."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy hazy yellowish orange, smells delicious. Lots of citrus and coriander. The taste is nice and citrusy, lots of orange flavor. Leaves a nice 2 finger head. One of the best Belgian style witbiers I've had. Can't wait to have some again to do a proper review, I did this off of memory."
""

"Allagash White could quite possibly be the best flagship beer in New England. I know some people gravitate to Pretty Things' Jack D'Or or to Smuttynose IPA, but this beer can definitely stand up to any flagship contenders. Its 5%ABV and pleasant taste make Allagash White great for any time throughout the year."

"bought a 4-pack from the spec's in downtown houston. i've been trying for awhile to find a good wit and this is by far my favorite. everything about it was perfect. the color, the smell, the mouthfeel, and the aftertaste. just a really crisp and refreshing beer, perfect for a hot south texas day, which is pretty much everyday."
"D: easily acquired and well-known wit. my biggest complaints are the head retention and carbonation level, which are nit-picky things to be dissecting. overall a solid thirst quencher."
"Comes across as a nice spicy heffe. My palate is pulling coriander and something else that I can't quite put my finger on. This is a good beer, but nothing that I could drink on a regular basis."
"Light-bodied with moderate carbonation. This is a staple brew for me though I don't drink it as much as I used to because I've been expanding on my tastings. Still, this beer is just so drinkable and clean...I always enjoy it."
"O: This beer surprised me. There was certainly a lot going on and a lot to like. This style was enjoyable but to be honest this was my first of this style so I really need to check out more to find out why this is as good as everyone says."
"93."
"I'd want to taste a few of these classic Wits together to see what really sets the apart. This one seems a little less mellow and more tart, so it might be just the thing for a big Oktoberfest stein."
"I strongly prefer the Allagash White fresh on-tap over the bottled offering. I am proud to have this example of fine brewing craftsmanship come from the USA."
"O- Good balance, great representation of the style. Nice to see such an excellent example from an american brewery."
"overall very crisp and tasty."
"O- Great brew, fantastic to behold. Great beer to sit on the porch on a sunny fall day and watch the leaves fall and the currents dance in your glass."
"Allagash white pours hazy straw, offers a generous, lingering head, and displays a beautiful bouquet of citrus and subtle spice. With a fairly mild body and a refreshing finish that leaves a hint of bitter orange peel, Allagash White is a great food pairing beer and a perfect summertime refresher."
"o - if you want a delicious belgian heavily loaded with citrus lemon, you will absolutely love this brew. goes great with meals (had it with sushi tonight) and it's a good pub beer. parents got a keg of this for my grad party and almost everyone was thoroughly enjoying killing this keg. (the few that didn't like the keg were sticking with their carbonated water, aka bud light and coors)"
"Creamier than I expected. Very mellow and smooth but the carbonation bites. Also not as sweet as many witbiers. Dry and creamy with muted spice. Very nicely done."
"As I get more experience I hope to provide more detailed reviews."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip, no bottle date or batch number. Pours hazy golden amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger whilte head with nice retention, that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Some nice lacing clings to the glass as well, with a steady stream of carbonation coming from the bottom. Aromas of big banana, clove, bubblegum, spices, citrus peel, and a bit of wheat tang. Very nice aromas here and are very true to style as well. Taste of big spices, banana, clove, citrus peel, wheat, and breadiness. Not much bitterness on the finish, but there are plenty of lingering notes of spice, citrus, bread, and clove. Medium-high carbonation with medium body; with a great and slightly creamy mouthfeel, that leads to very smooth and enjoyable drink. Alcohol is well hidden as expected, nothing other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall an outstanding witbier that is extremely refreshing, and has a great balance of flavors."
"O: Overall this is a great beer and one of the best if not the best example of a Witbier out there today. Highly recommended"
"O - Very enjoyable, I had two."
"O: Again, not really my style, but I wouldn't kick it out of bed if I found one there."
"O: Very drinkable, enjoyable witbier that was perfect on a hot day. Would have another any day."
"O: A pretty good Wit. This is the first Allagash I have had and I will certainly seek out more."
"Conclusion: This would be one of the best wits I've had to date, if it wasn't for that firm, kind of uncharacteristic bitterness, which kind of messes things up a bit, which is too bad."
"O: Such a good beer -- another success from Allagash. Recommended. Will have again when I'm in the mood for a spiced witbier."
"O- I am upset that it has taken me this long to try one of these, perfect beer to take down in warmer weather or when you are in the mood for something light and refreshing"
"O: Very well done, I must say. It's one you could have more than one of, especially while enjoying a good wedge of cheese and some cut up pepperoni. To your health!"
"The 2011 Bachelor Party Extravaganza keeps on truckin' at Sheffield's. This bit of entertainment pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of solid white foam. The nose comprises coriander, wheat, light black pepper, lemon zest, light mandarin orange, clove, and a twist of grapefruit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of banana, nutmeg, and cardamom. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice wit. 'Nuff said, frankly."
"Overall, one of the best wits that you can buy...certainly among the top tier domestic wits there is."
"This was a good beer overall. I had this almost a year ago and had to try it again, not what I’m rating. Will certainly have it again."
"O- Good wit. The malt and fruit balance is great and refreshing. Not quite as spicy as I expected, but still enough complexity in this that I don't feel it was missing anything."
"Overall: An exceptional tasting witbier that deserves the high rating it has. Delicious beer that I plan to have whenever I can get access to it again."
"12oz bottle. A great Belgian wit. Smooth and refreshing with active carbonation. Cloudy yellow color with white head. Flavor is sweet malt, coriander, lemon, yeast, and lots of spices. Smooth and easy to drink. Very well done. Pretty much the class of the style if you ask me."
"As not a fan of wheat beers this one is definitely different then the rest, more complex and frankly enjoyable."
"O - good tasting and very easy to drink"
"This beer pours a light yellow color and hazy. the smell is wheat, citrus, clove, coriander, and banana. the flavor follows suit but is not quite as prominent as in the smell. the mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. overall a good example of the style."
"The mouthfeel is very light bodied with millions of small compacted bubbles of carbonation on the pour. A beer that practically dances in your mouth. Super drinkable and very refreshing!"
"Great brew, the best witbier I've had to date."
"Note: I almost kicked the keg on my second round and won a tee shirt at Goodnight Irene's in NJ."
"Overall this is a one and done for me. Its a good tasting beer but not amazing by any means."
"I poured a twelve oz. bottle into a hand blown pint glass, back by natural light it has a beautiful, light honey hue, wispy cloudiness, and a white head. A light spice on the tongue, slight tartness to the nose, descent lacing. Very refreshing, build for a mid to late summers afternoon."
"Overall, I would recommend the beer highly in the Witbier style, but personally I would not pursue again for a while."
"Very well balanced Witbier flavor with a great citrus presence."
"Overall: I LOVE drinking this beer! I really wish it were cheaper for a 4-pack, but it's got to be the best white ale I've tried that's American brewed."
"Final Thoughts: This is the kind of beer I live for. This screams ""drink me under a tree on a warm day"" but it also says ""Sip me as the multi-colored leaves fall from the trees."" This one makes my top 10 favorite of all time. I'm not a big witbier fan at all, but this was stellar. As a wine-loving asshole use to say to me ""It's better then sex!"" Thank you allagash. The hype on this one is true."
"O- This is a fantastic beer in the style, and I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again- especially in the warm summer months."
"Terrific beer anytime especially when 90 degrees. Unibroue sets the mark for me with this one, but Allagash hits it just as well."
"T: This is probably my favorite wit. I could drink this all day long. Clean and refreshing without being boring. Lemon zest, coriander and some clove with a light and slightly creamy mouthfeel. This one is a keeper."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a nice 2 finger head that is slow to fade. Aroma is a nice blend of wheat and citrus. Flavor is a nice balance between the malt and the orange/lemon citrus flavors. Light body with a good level of carbonation. Overall, a fantastic example if the style and a great beer for a hot summer day."
"A very tasty witbier indeed. Super easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Overall: Excellent beer for its category. You can tell it is on the light side without losing the taste."
"Seemed a little flat, but I wonder if that was the tap line. Overall a good beer for the summer for sure!"
"Nice light body with somewhat sharp carbonation. Overall this one is a good lighter offering. Could be a solid go-to beer."
"This is my go to beer at a local beer bar when I'm not feeling the other varieties. It is creamy golden in color with a sweet, light and smooth flavor throughout. Not too heavy, not too light, and just sweet enough to not overwhelm. Has a bit of a hop bite, but is more on the wheat side. Overall delicious."
"Ideal wit beer, by far the most balanced I've had, first dive into this brewery and the rave reviews are well deserved. A definite staple for the fridge, very refreshing."
"overall really good beer i look forward to trying their other beers"
"O: One of the more enjoyable wit’s I’ve tried and an all-around enjoyable and highly drinkable beer. Now if we could just get this in all the restaurants and bars instead of Blue Moon…"
"Very light and dry in the mouth. Overall a very good beer not right on style compared to other wits but extremely drinkable. Another above average beer from Allagash."
"Overall, man, what a beer. Cold Allagash White, a lobster roll, a beautiful Maine day. What more could you possibly want?"
"D-Overall i liked this brew. And exspecially as this style not being one of my favs it really impressed me. Loved the spices used in this beer. WOuld reccomend to anyone to try."
"A great witbier, perhaps my favorite of the style."
"This White can hang with the French and Belgian Wits any day!"
"Highly recommended"
"This is a damn fine beer. Knocked back two pints over lunch at 121 Restaurant in North Salem NY. Sat outside on a sunny day, and was able to hold the glass up to some gorgeous sunlight. Beautiful straw coloration with one of the whitest and fluffiest heads I've ever seen. Citrus and wheat on the nose made me begin salivating. Taste was smooth and clean with that breadiness of a good wheat beer coming through in a big way. I could have sat on that porch all day drinking this beer. While they have a nice little selection of crafts at 121, I think I'll be ordering this one up again when I return."
"Appearance is a hazy pale straw, close to the color of lemonade, perhaps even lighter. A thick pale-white head sits atop, with a fair amount of lacing left on the glass. Scents are wheaty and citrusy - smells like pineapple to me. The wheat continues into the taste - reminded me a bit of cereal - with a hint of lemon. There was a touch of sweetness in the finish. This beer is an excellent example of its style."
"Pours a clody yellow, big poof of white foam, good retention and decent lacing. Scent is of fresh cracked wheat, white bread and yeast, lighlty spiced with notes of lemon and banana are present, but not forward. Taste follows scent, the breadyness of the beer (including yeasts) are the star with the citrus and spice noted being kept under wraps, the sweetness is also mild when compared to other wheats. Faint hint of tartness. Medium bodied, heftier then others in the style, lightly dry, active carbonation. A good, solid wit beer."
"O: Impressive for what it is."
"O: A very good Witbier. To me don't seem like much of a difference between this and a Hefe. Definitely will return to this one."
"O: Delightful."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer, and I was surprised. I'm not sure why, but I wasn't expecting much from this one. This is instantly a favorite of mine. Anyone who loves whits, wheats, hefes, etc will love this one."
"A superb take on the style. Light golden with perfect ""double shine"" from the yeast. Nice head and retention with better than average lacing for a wit. Bright lemony smell with a pale dry wheat malt undercurrent. Faint spiciness. Taste is right in line with a bigger spice component and a perfect dry clove tinged finish. Lovely sourness make this one so refreshing. Light feel with just enough gravity to it and spot on carbonation with a light tinglyness. So drinkable and delicious I took all I had to keep from just giving this one fives across the board. Stock up for the summer folks!"
"O: A simple, great witbier."
"O: Very interesting and sweet wheat beer. The spices give it a very interesting kick not present in most wheat beers."
"Overall: A very drinkable and crisp wit. It is a little weak, but big, bold flavours aren't the point of this style. Great beer for craft beginners as well."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer, and should give anyone who is thinking about shelling out the extra cash for an import a serious reason to pause. Drink (more) local: the Allagash brewers show themselves more than capable of making excellent Belgian style beers."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer and one of the better examples of this style that I have had. It has a clean and very well blended flavor. I like the lack of, or mild spicing, so that this beer doesn't come across like some kind of lemon cake like a lot of them do. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"O - Really nice witbier. Some good wit characteristics makes this a very easy to drink and easy to suggest offering."
"Poured a hazy straw color with bone white head and decent head retention. Streaming lace all around the glass and has a good amount of carbonation. The nose is spicy citrus and lemon. Nice balance of sweet and hoppyness. I find the mouthfeel very velvety and easy to drink The rich wheat is balanced by Belgian yeast and the spice is nice. Perfect session beer"
"O: When commericals say coors light is refreshing, they wish they had this refreshment in a beer. This is an overall amazing beer."
"O - A very nice witbier. Would likely be a good gateway type craft, while bringing a lot ofgreat wit characteristics, due to the approachable nature of the style."
"O--A great example of the style, but a bit too much watery for my liking."
"Straw color, very hazy, with rich white mousse for head. Aromas of coriander and lemon, nice aromatics. Flavor is mellow and wheaty, rich front with a spice that comes through afer a few seconds on the tongue. Flavors of orange peel, lemon, wheat, coriander, and allspice. Refreshing and mellow, very silky mouthfeel. Solid."
"O: A delicious, drinkable spiced summer beer."
"It poured beautifully. It had a great cloudy golden yellow appearance. The smell was by far my favorite part; besides the taste that is. Yeast and spices dominated the smell and was very refreshing. after smelling, I anticipated that the spices would overwhelm all other aspects of taste. However, this beer is very well balanced and was very crisp and clean. It was super refreshing! I will definitely drink this beer again!"
"great representation of a traditional witbier: light, refreshing and easy to drink. enjoying very much on this warm evening."
"Poured a pale yellow, with a finger and change of white head. Leaves a fat collar with some milder retention. Laces mildly. Nose holds some lemon, orange and general citrus notes. Taste has just as much lemon and orange, very refreshing feel. Some wheat and again general citrus notes. Spritzy mouthfeel with a fairly high carbonation. A great summer beer, would be ideal to have regular access to this offering!"
"O: Save for the insane amount of carbonation. Pretty much a spot on wit."
"O- A solid wit. It's a top notch one, but there are still things that could be tweaked, particularly a longer finish. That being said, it's quite a good beer."
"I don't know what it is about Allagash but they just sort of bore me, this one doesn't do it for me either. It's okay but I certainly don't want to have it again."
"O-Overall a very solid witbier. Good amount of flavor with nothing getting out of balance. I could easily enjoy a number of these."
"I picked this up in a very small beer shop downtown and now I wish I had at least grabbed another. It's a great interpretation of the Belgian wheat style."
"O- Hands down one of the best American hefes that I have had a chance to have. A little too heavy on the spices, which had an almost medicinal tea flavor to it, yet it works. Really easy to drink and I will grab a few next time I make a beer run."
"Overall, very glad to find it whenever I do, and cheers to all you folks across the country who are surprised and grateful to be saved by this one on your chance outings."
"O: This is terrific; it is a very rare gem in an unexciting style."
"O: Unfortunately this was another fairly underwhelming beer from Allagash."
"OVERALL: C+ / B-"
"Overall -- I REALLY like this. Witbiers are probably not on my shortlist of favorite styles, but this one is incredible, better than many of the Belgian versions I've been able to try. Crisp, refreshing, a real winner."
"This pours as a foggy looking yellowish orange color. The head is decent. The lacing is pretty good too. The smells of citrus and other spices are very much in this beer. The aroma is probably the best part of this beer. The taste is good too but I felt that it fell just a bit short compared to the aromas is was giving off. The mouthfeel was pretty good for a white ale as well. Nicely carbonated and smooth."
"Allagash White pours a hazy lemon yellow, with just a faint bit of visibility present. The first pour only yielded about a finger's worth of fluffy white foam to top the beer, but after drinking down about half the glass I swirled what was left in my bottle and poured. I was rewarded with more than three fingers of head threatening to spill out over my glass, and receding very slowly. Rings of lacing look like halos gracing the top of my glass. The nose is solid for a wit, heavy on citrus (predominantly orange, but a bit of lemon present as well), with some sweet, cracker pale malt sweetness thrown in for good measure. There's much more to this beer though, as citrus and pale malt sweetness are joined on my palate by a slight tangy quality from the wheat and a touch of pepper. I'm actually a little bit in awe of just how perfectly every flavor is proportionally represented, I couldn't come up with a better blend if I tried. The body on this beer is the very definition of effervescent. The body is supremely light, but stops just short of watery, and the carbonation is bubbly and active. I've heard it described as being almost ""seltzery", and I would agree, but in a very good way. Allagash White is a beer that makes me think that maybe American brewers can do some Belgian styles even better then the originals. It's one of the very few beers I would buy a case of, especially with the warm weather coming in."
"Poured from my growler to my Duvel tulip. Color is straw yellow slightly hazy with a fluffy head that dies quickly into a ring of small bubbles. There is minimal lacing. The smell is wheat spicy spicy belgium yeast and wheat with a hint of malt sweetness at the end. This is a very inviting smell so I proceed with no abandon. The taste of the legendary Allagash White zesty yeast on the tongue filled in with wheat graininess and a hint of sweetness such as candy sugar perhaps or maybe the sweet malts are so separated from yeast at the end of my drinks that it seems to end with a full body sweetness. This is a good example of a Witbier."
"Overall Drinkability - Enjoyable as a dry witbier. Doesn't offer enough complexity."
"O: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't slightly disappointed in this beer, yet I can taste that it is carefully crafted with skill. I guess I could sum it up by saying I appreciate the craft but find the taste refreshing yet a little plain and boring."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Great appearance. Nice cloudy golden hue, great foamy head, and lots of dry sticky lacing. Nose is grainy and yeasty with a nice balance of citrus and spice. Flavor is not complex, but a refreshing combination of yeast, hops, and spice. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall I do not like this style of beer usually because most are too watery without the proper balance of malt and spice but this one does not fail in that regard. Allagash is a highly under-rated brewery."
"I will like to try this one again when it is warmer out..."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no date or lot code seen. Sampled on March 26, 2011. It pours a very cloudy yellow with a small head and busy carbonation. Wheat and yeast on the nose. The body is quite palpable and in the medium range. The first reaction I get to the taste is that it is tart but then the wheat and yeast kick in to make it more enjoyable. Mellow to the end with a slight hop finish."
"O- Overall this was a fantastic beer, it had characteristics in common with a tripel like La Fin Du Monde and a hefeweizen. Lots of great flavor and very drinkable and refreshing."
"Overall this is a great representation of a traditional witbier. Very light, refreshing and easy to drink. I would like to enjoy this again on a warm day."
"O - overwhelmed by the yeast. Perhaps good for a summer day, but I'm still sticking with IPAs for the summer months. I would be surprised if I gave this another shot."
"Cloudy yellowish dish water look, pretty par for the course on this style of beer. White head, not huge, and goes away but leaves some down the sides as its consumed. Smell is spicy. Taste with some citrus, again par for the course for this style, but the spices and the carbonation was spot on. I like it.."
"One of my favorite WitBiers. This would be a great summer beer but I would also enjoy it as a compliment to a steak dinner."
"D: Although sometimes inconsistent in terms of intensity of its sensory qualities, at its best Allagash White is an American wit without peer. If anything, the intensity of flavors here may scare away some casual drinkers--a rare feat for such an approachable style. It makes a strong first impression with its remarkable appearance and leaves on a favorable note with the taste and feel of wheat."
"Overall, very easy to drink and enjoyable. I would have it again but I enjoy other wits more."
"I give two Schlitz about Allagash White. It gives more blanco for your bank-o."
"Poured a light cloudy yellow with a small creamy white head that was fully diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was very mild of grainy malts, light herbal hops and a strong moldy yeast with notes of coriander, pepper and citrus(orange peel I believe). It tasted moderately bitter at first for a wheat ale and ended with a light bitter yeasty flavor that had hints of spices and orange peel with the flavor not lasting long at all. Mouthfeel was light in body and creamy in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall a nice creamy wheat ale, actually nicely surprising."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean as I mentioned earlier, but can also get creamy in parts which is a nice contrast. Drinkability is very good too, with the body being full and diverse in taste and the finish being light, dry and neutral. Worthy beer that is distributed pretty well."
"I would recommend to all beer lovers."
"Drinkability - Great beer for this style. Good any time of year."
"D - Very high. Could see myself drinking several of these on a hot day on the back porch or at a cafe people watching."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a hazy pale yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount extremely quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, banana, and slight dirt. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, banana, grain, and a slight earthy note. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was definitely not a bad brew at all. Had a nicely balanced sweetness going on in the flavor here with a nice fruit aspect as well. Also a good aroma to keep you coming back. The dirt was a little off-putting but seemed to flow quite nicely. A definite must try!"
"The CPJ"
"I must say I was once in the category of being scared of the spicy belgian style beer, but now I have been enlightened by the balance and presence offered by Allagash White. Thank you Portland, Maine. One day I shall pay my respects with a visit."
"I have been enjoying wheat beer more lately and this one was very nice. I thought it had great balance and strong flavors. I could certainly have a few of these on a hot summer day."
"Definitely very drinkable, and I could easily see myself absentmindedly downing a pitcher of this if I weren't careful."
"Overall: This is a great wheat beer. It is not as sweet as some other wit beers; it is more aggressively hopped, which creates a refreshing and balanced bitter finish. I would enjoy this at any time of the year, though it would be best on warmer and sunnier days during the spring or summer."
"Smell was of light lemon and a little grassy. The taste was very fresh and light. The main flavor was form the yeast with some crispness from the carbonation. Also slight lemon zest and almost a soapy freshness that stayed with the aftertaste. This is another classic example of someone executing the Wit. Tougher than most would think. But, they certainly hit this one out of the park."
"This a beer that I'll be having a for a long, long while. Totally accessible, recommendable and drinkable for all seasons. One of these days I'm gonna have a taste off with this and Hoegaarden. Good times will be had!"
"T: Nice light body and crisp carbonation, big backbone of yeast and pale grains with coriander and slight hop notes. Lemon zest and orange peel come through more towards the finish, very slight bitterness. One of the more balanced Witbeer's, while it's nice and yeasty/malty, it isn't overpowering, nor are the citrus and spice notes. Mellow and balanced, a great summer drink."
"Usually on tap or 12oz bottle poured into snifter glass. Body appeared almost the color of orange flesh - orange subdued by white cloudiness, with a half inch of white head that eventually subsided. Aroma was sweet orange peel, grass, coriander, a dash of pepper, and perhaps cloves. Flavor was sweet clove like malt, light orange peel, with a subdued sweetness toward the back, slightly herbal, grassy and citric. Palate was very soft and sensuous, carbonation just tickled the back of the throat, and afterards a light orange peel taste lingered."
"Appearance is a slightly cloudy yellow orange with barely a little foam. Pretty good retention. Aroma is mild, but otherwise typical of wits. Spices, citrus, yeast. Taste is very creamy, with a bit of citric zest and spice. Good yeast profile too. Really impressive, actually. Mouthfeel is light, very smooth, and very drinkable. Quality wit."
"The spices are the highlight of this one for me. It's a great tasting wheat beer without the heavy body that comes with most wheat beers I've tasted."
"D - easy drinkability. its an ok beer for me."
"D: Good beer. Great representation of the style, particularly for an American brewery."
"D- Very easy to drink. So creamy for such a grainy style beer. Smooth and slight sweet edge. Flows so easy."
"The best....the best the best i got this beer at the best beer store.Francestown village store!!! a must see store has every beer you can imagine!"
"D: A very easy drinking beer, putting away a bomber of this (or maybe even a 6-pack) would be no trouble at all."
"d. pretty easy to drink, but not as exciting as i expected."
"Great choice of a belgian style unfiltered wheat. Great brewery to visit in Portland, Maine."
"Allagash White is a typical witbier. It pours a slightly hazy, pale yellow with minimal head and no lasting lace. It's aroma is largely of banana with hints of coriander and vanilla. The flavor starts with spice notes followed by lemon and a good malt/hop balance. The mouthfeel is light and it's drinkability is good. Very refreshing. Recommended."
"D - Very high. Session...got for it."
"Brilliant use of spices, great balance. Just a joy to drink."
"A+++"
"No detectable bitterness, just a little pepper to balance out the sweetness. Delicious and quenching. I'd love to drink many more."
"D - one of the best beers I've had to just sit there, watch TV and chill out with. had this in a late fall cold snap, but this would be equally great out on the porch in a dead summer heat"
"D - Great beer for any time of year and even newbies may enjoy this fine representation. Worth trying, good times."
"Overall - I would recommend trying this one if you like wheat beers/witbiers. I thought it would be a more concentrated, flavorful version of Blue Moon or Hoegaarden, which it was; but not in ways that were very enjoyable."
"Taste is very light and subdued, but also spicy and crisp. It's not too in your face but re Belgian yeast comes through well. Very good and easy drinking."
"D - this is a good drinking beer and will go right down on a humid day. While it's easy to drink, other aspects keep me from giving it a higher score."
"Very good beer made by a good brewery. I have had the pleasure of meeting the owner a couple of times and he is very committed to putting out quality beers."
"D: Highly drinkable and one of the better witbiers Ive had."
"It poured to be a light golden color with a citrus aroma. There was no bitter aftertaste. This beer is very easy to drink and you can easily drink more than one in a session."
"Not bad, but I was expecting more after seeing all the reviews."
"D- This is by far the most drinkable beer I've ever tasted. The taste is delicious and the faintness in the aftertaste almost just leaves you wanting more. Seems like the perfect beer to drink on a hot day. I actually once thought that while the mass produced beers failed in every other category, they had drinkability down to an art. This beer has changed everything about that belief."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma of citrusy hops, lemon peel, grapefruit. Flavor of citrusy light spicey hops and some yeastiness. Palate is light body with nice carbonation, crisp mouth feel. Finish is citrus, grapefruit, light hops with some spice, yeast, ending in some light bitterness. A nice and refreshing easy drinking brew."
"M/D: Extremely easy drinking. Light and refreshing. Overall a really well made beer, worthy of its status as one of the best in its style."
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with a small, short lived head. Fruity, yeasty aroma with hints of floral hops. Medium, crisp body. Flavor is of citrus fruit, yeast, sweet malt and spicy hops. Medium, fruity finish. Nice wit beer. I like it more than Hoegaarden."
"Drink well my friends."
"Insanely clear, beautiful light pale straw color. Really find myself admiring the initial presentation after the pour, even clear in the bottle. 1/2", almost pure white head at the pour, settles to a thin top with thick ring around edge. Spicy notes hit moderately hard at first sniff, not over powering though, some light citris aromas accompany and the following sniffs. High carbonation, lots of rising bubbles continue long after pour. Very light on the tongue. Spiciness not as heavy as expected, leans more towards the citrisy orange and lemon accompanied lightly by the spice of clove and others that presented themselves more in the aroma. Spices, clove and some cinnimin are found on the finish of the beer, the dryer notes of cinnimin and some grape linger on the toungue. Refreshing and light. Amazingly thick white lacing on the glass when all was done. very well balanced."
"Big bright orange/ yellowish bright pour, fluffy white head. Smell was yeast sweetness, some cinnamon/ coriander spice. Taste was clean, light, with more spice coming through. Mouthfeel was light, so if you like the lighter style coriander, you'll love this. This was a solid beer, very drinkable, will be having this again."
"Overall, I like this one. I decided I need a break from big beers for awhile and thought this would be a good place to start and I was right. Very good witbier and I'm glad I had it. I recommend it thoroughly and will check out the rest of Allagash's work as a result."
"D- Drinkability is high. The flavor sticks around and each sip is as good as the previous. Crisp, dry, vibrant flavors and ample carbonation help drive the senses and this was a great first start into the Allagash lineup."
"This beer has a huge following and it's easy to know why. Goes really well with Vegatable Lo-Mein."
"Drink-Yes please can I have some more to session with good friends and a nice pairing cheese."
"Notes: If I had to use one word to describe this beer, it would be 'soft.' An excellent interpretation of the style. This rivals anything I've had coming out of Belgium. Probably my favorite Witbier to date."
"Great brew all in all, the one problem I have is that its just doesn't look appetizing at all, other than that its excellent"
"Overall quite drinkable and enjoyable and well worth trying if you have never had it. It is a good gateway beer to get friends who only know fizzy yellow beers to try craft beers. However, if you are a BA, try Allagash's other offerings if they are available where you are as they are quite bold and many are outstanding!"
"Cloudy straw colored with small white head and great lacing. Aroma of wheat and orange. Tasty citrus and spice blend. Exceptionally drinkable. Definitely ranks up in the top 5 white beers I've had."
"Pours a nice hazy golden yellow with a white head and some small lacing that sticks around a moment. Smells of coriander and other spices mixed with orange peel and godly bliss. Tastes like an almost perfect blend of crisp spices and fresh citrus; light, bubbly, fantastic. Mouthfeel is very nice with carbonation giving the brew even more life. High drinkability."
"D- Good tasting beer, good feel, refreshing and low abv is easibly drinkable. Best in the summertime but would gladly drink any time of the year."
"A hazy, golden pour leaves a solid inch of frothy head that clings to the tulip, great retention as well. Nice floral scents, yeast, bananas, and some spiciness and wheat. Taste follows the smell, adding some citrus that i didn't pick up in the nose. Very crisp, perfectly carbonated. This is a great example of a Belgian Wit."
"I could drink several of these gems. SUPERB beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Could probably drink this all night"
"A very good wit. Lots of citrus fruits. It's crisp and refreshing. One of the best I've had of this style."
"Pours a lighter golden with a nice white head that laced nicely. Super fresh smell to it. Citrus/lemon. Smell is of fruit some hops and earth. An extremely smooth white ale that gives citrus tastes throughout. Great for a nice warm day. Very drinkable with nice taste and smell."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style, I find it a little less overwhelming then some of the others I've tried in this style so I can drink it easier than those."
"I can drink mass quantities of this brew but, sometimes price comes into play so I stick with the 4 pack for me or a couple of glasses at a local restaurant"
"A full mouthfeel and a triumphant finish. A white beer done well - 5.2 abv may be a tad disappointing, but that's alright when it tastes so clean, so lemon, so full."
"I definitely recommend this beer to anyone looking for great Belgian wit beer. You will not be disappointed."
"Poured into a tulip from a 12 oz bottle which I poured by swirling that last 25% of the beer and dumped on top. It's a very light golden color, with a slight orange color as well. medium sized head and very cloudy and opaque despite the light color. Although the head eventually dissipates, there is some good lacing going on throughout. Smells of spices, coriander, and citrusy lemon. It tastes delicious, with the spiciness hitting up front and no hint of sourness from the citrus. It's big flavored, refreshing and goes down smooth. Medium bodied with some zip that doesn't seem to come from the carbonation. This is a perfect session beer and is great for anytime. A truly great brew."
"Had a pint recently and truly enjoyed this beer. I tend to judge all wheat beers against my favorite -- Hacker Pschor. The Allagash is lighter and has more of the typical Belgian flavors of spice, especially coriander, yeast, some citrus and banana. Very crisp mouth feel and exceedingly drinkable. Overall, not my favorite style, but I'd happily enjoy this brew when in the mood. A treat on a hot day. Definitely worth a try!"
"Just tapped my first 1/6 keg at home. Being a huge fan of Hoegaarden, I must admit I think I found a new favorite American Witbier. I bought a four-pack of bottles before committing to a 1/6 keg. I will say I am not disappointed. It's twice as good on tap!!"
"This is a solid beer from Allagash, it appears as a very hazy golden straw color with a nice head and beautiful lacing. The nose is full is esters from the yeast, some citrus fruits and lots of coriander. The taste is very similiar to the smell, Belgian yeast, lots of coriander, a big citrus push with lush tones of wheat holding these flavors all together. The carbonation is on the higher side and works work wonders with these strong flavors. Overall, I could drink this beer all day. A very sessionable beer that is well crafted."
"Pours a clear, pale gold. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of wheat, hops, and slight clove. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of grain, slight wheat, yeast, slight clove, hops, and hint of citrus. Ovearll, good aroma, body, and blend."
"-Edited 4/12/14"
"Moderate carbonation and a light, creamy mouthfeel. Initial wheat profile followed by a bit more lemon, orange, and a slight sourness on the finish. Very mild and refreshing."
"I have always been partial to spiced beers and witbiers in particular, but few have struck my fancy more than this beauty. Bright yellow cloudy appearance--really vibrant in the glass for a wheat. Nose is intense but not overdone, very spicy with coriander practically leaping out of the glass. Taste is phenomenal, very much a manifestation of all the delicious smells. A classic wit with coriander, just enough lemon/orange citrus tang, very much what a Belgian wheat should taste like. Spices are dominant on the palate, and yet not in an oppressive way, still extremely refreshing and tastes like beer, not a spice rack, which is how some over-the-top wits can feel. Mouthfeel is a bit creamier and fuller than some other wits I've had, perhaps because the abv is a bit higher. For example, I'd definitely rather drink one Allagash white than a Hoegaarden, but if I had to drink a full six-pack of one, I might go with the latter. A truly excellent beer from a top-notch brewery--one of America's finest interpretation of the Belgian wit, no doubt about that."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being on the higher side. Drinkability is very good, it's a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. Very good version of the style and very good beer overall."
"Update: I did a side-by-side tasting of Hoegaarden and Allagash White. They were exactly the same color. Hoegaarden's aroma was better and more pronounced and Hoegaarden had a creamier mouth-feel. The flavors were very similar but Allagash's flavor was stronger. It was an extremely close call but Allagash won with the stronger flavor; this round at least."
"D- this is a wonderfully refreshing beer, will definetly buy again."
"D- Beside the bold taste of spice in this beer. It is very good. It's light and refreshing. I'll have another."
"Pours a hazy light orange yellowish color with a 1finger white head that leaves a soapy lacing. The aroma is of white peaches, lemon zest and some coriander. The flavor the is similar to the aroma. It's got a spicy coriander and lemon peel component. Really nice wheat characteristics and light bodied. Mouthfeel is on point with the style. Really refreshing and enjoyable in this hot weather. Easily on of the better wit biers I have had thus far."
"So, let me make sure I have this right; it's a beer that looks great, smells really nice and tastes utterly amazing. Along with that, it's smooth as anything, and barely clocks in at 5% alcohol. Yeah, let's just say this beer is highly, highly drinkable."
"D - I got two, and I normally don't drink witbiers. It was a great drink to have after a hot day on the beach paired with calamari, then a tilefish dinner."
"I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer. Allagash White was my gateway beer. I can still remember the Allagash night I went to at my college's pub, where I got a pint of White in a logo pint glass I got to keep. It started my beer glass collection. Anyway, I'm reviewing a fridge chilled 12oz bottle poured into a different Allagash logo glass (a 25cl flute). I can only fit about 2/3 of the bottle into this glass, so the appearance may change after I pour in the yeast. The liquid is a slighty tarnished yellow, with a small white head. There is a lot of rising carbonation and a bit that clings to the sides. [After emptying the bottle, I bumped this category up from a 4 to a 5. There is a huge pure white head now, great lacing, and a beautiful opaque body. It looks as a wit should.] This beer has a great aroma. It is dry and sweet, with lots of Belgian sugar and yeast. I can also smell wheat, grass and a bit of pepper spice. The beer tastes of wheat and Belgian candi sugar. It has some champagne-like flavors up front, but I wouldn't say I can taste white grapes specifically. The finish has more spices; black pepper and coriander. The wheat and yeast wrap things up in the aftertaste that lingers slightly. The white has a medium body and plenty of carbonation. There isn't much coating after I swallow, but it feels like it covers every corner of my mouth white I'm drinking each sip. And oh does each sip come easily. This is such a drinkable beer. On a warm, humid day like today, I could easily drink a number of these beers. No aspect of this beer every gets tiring. Unfortunately, I think this beer gets a slightly bad rap in its hometown. I know that a number of us Portland beer nerds (aka beer snobs) occasionally look down at people who order an Allagash White when there are more adventurous beers available. A lot of us see this beer as Portland's training wheels craft beer; its fine if your scared, but real beer drinkers will get a strong, more intense beer. Is this a side-effect of the demand for extreme, barrel-aged everything? Perhaps. Either way, White deserve all the respect it can get. This is an incredible beer and a wonderful flagship for one of the best breweries in the country. It is worth ordering, no matter what the other folks at the bar think; just don't ask for a slice of lemon with it..."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, nice kick, nice representation of style. This is one that is easy drinking for an evening."
"Tried on tap, bottled at a bar (where the server remembered to swirl the wheat at the second half of the pour), and bottled at home. Every time served into a standard pint glass. A quite refreshing summer witbier with a nice frosty texture and mouthfeel. The flavor has mild hoppy bitterness but undertones of pineapple."
"Drinkability: Perfectly balanced and spiced. Nice and light. I could sip this one all day."
"Overall - Outstanding for sure, it's perfect beer for drinking on a nice day. One of the best wit's I've had!"
"Pairing: Bacalao fritter with corn and jalapeno chowder"
"I hadn't had this beer in a long time so I thought i'd revisit it. Even better than I remember it. It's got a restrained lemon quality that doesn't overpower the yeast, and for me the yeast in a belgian wit should really shine through. There's some very nice spiciness in the smell as well as the taste. It reminds me of white pepper and of course coriander. I like that they don't overdo the spices so that the other flavors can come through. This would be a great beer with chicken francaise or maybe some friend fish."
"The smell came off as chemical-y to me. Very clean but a bit too grassy, almost. Goes down how it smells, clean, beautiful in color and very crisp. I enjoyed it but the taste was a bit too reminiscent of it's smell for me--I couldn't quite get past the chemical association I made at first whiff."
"Allagash White is very pleasant beer. It's a little pricey at $7-8 for a 750 ml bottle in SoCal stores, but the prices on-tap at bars are sometimes on par with that, so you're more likely to see me drink this in a bar than at home. Highly recommended."
"I much prefer this beer on-tap. The spices are slightly toned down, resulting in a smoother experience. For a witbier, I find drinkability to be important, and this beer goes down well on tap. The citrus, spice, and wheat have a great balance. In the bottle, the spice is too strong."
"Overall an excellent wit. Perhaps the best domestic example of the style."
"I really like this beer. It doesn't have quite the overwhelming bubble gum and banana aromas that can come from other domestic witbiers. It is balanced, complexed, and very easy drinking. I've seen this on-tap recently and really look forward to trying it on draft."
"My favorite summer brew. Glowing orange in color with a lot of cloudiness. The bitter orange peel adds a nice bite to this one, more so than the popular Hoegaarden. More flavorful, but at the same time very refreshing. Very good out of the bottle, but it's becoming more commonly found on tap in bars in my area. Worth checking out, if you haven't yet."
"Pours a lemonade yellow with an inch pearl white head which retains for most of the beer. Lemon, citrus, wheat and yeast aroma. Nice light, crisp wheat flavor to start. Next comes lemon zest, citrus and light spices. Sweet malt. Finishes with sweet bread and grains and some tang. Very enjoyable light wheat flavor profile. Not any one huge flavor but well blended. High carbonation and light mouthfeel."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The beer is cloudy but clears up after it has sat for a white. The aroma is coriander and orange peel. The flavor is more of the same with the addition of a little bit of lemon and yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D- Very nice witbier that has an excellent blending of everything that's going on."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night long. At 5.2, it's definitely sessionable, and with these flavors, why not? I think I may have a new football season favorite!"
"Can I have another, please?"
"D-The beer is well balanced and has a light and refreshing taste. It's lighter body and carbonation make this a refreshing and easy beer to drink."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Had this the other night and had to pick one up to review. A great witbier - one of the best I've ever had. This will be a go to beer for me if I am in the witbier mood."
"A solid example of the style; however, IMO Unibroue Blanche de Chamby brings more flavor to the party."
"D: It's extremely easy to consume and is thirst quenching, particularly on a hot summer day."
"D- Very easy to drink and a great beer for the summer!"
"Served on: June 6, 2010"
"Taste is soft and creamy lemon meringue pie with a topping of grated coriander seeds. So delicious and refreshing! Wheat tang is delectable and the citrus peel and mild hops make for more than enough bittering on the finish. More hop presence than most witbiers, that is for sure. Cranks the flavor profile up a notch compared to say, a hoegaarden, but I am not necessarily sure that is a good thing. Regardless, my glass emptied at an astonishing rate...a must try for any fan of witbiers. Sucks this one is so expensive at nearly 10 bucks a four-pack, as this makes a most excellent summer pounder."
"Drinkability is high, extremely easy to drink a few bottles on a summer day. Too bad you only get a four pack for nine bucks, or this would replace my summer staple - Hoegaarden."
"D - This is a nice easy drinking beer. A good summer selection. I enjoyed it quite a bit and would definitely have it again."
"Taste exhibits some light citrus, but it pairs nicely with a good portion of wheat and a little spiciness. Nice firm medium body for a white, which makes this drink all the more enjoyable. Light and smooth makes this beer incredibly drinkable in most any situation."
"Growler filled at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours fully clouded, yellowy apricot, delicate white cap resting above, fine and plentiful lace. oh so tasty and tender nose of delicate coriander, orange and wheaty malts and yeast. Simply delicious nectar of the gods..more orange, subtly lime flourishes, coriander again, drying citric hops...enjoyed on an unusually warm spring day..looking forward to the salads, bread and cheeses of summer, joined by this fine accompaniment . Delicate, yet flavorful, fine achievement in brewing going on here. Widely available, enjoyed getting a fresh sample on draft (in my growler)"
"Notes: This is definitely the smooth and flavorful type of wheat beer as opposed to the highly carbonated/very brightly flavored wheat beers, and this is a very good one at that. The flavors are pretty unique, but just very well executed. Try it and you will not regret it."
"D-I could down this all day especially on a hot summer day but the price ($9 for a 4 pack in MA) would prevent this...Worth the price though"
"D: will drink again. though, i will have to drink it before i retreat to the treat of hitachino nest's--i can't stop thinking about that beer. smooth and satisfying and probably better from a bottle. i'm skeptical that the taps were filthy, much like the service and the staff. perhaps i'm just ipa bitter that my pug-faced bar maiden didn't wish me a happy birthday after scrutinizing my id. atmosphere and attitude are always essential to this sensitive bro's experience."
"Tastes spectacular and goes down easy. The low-ish ABV% makes this a great quaffer."
"D-this is very refreshing and has a solid feel. earthy and grainy with a good balance of banana and spice. very solid wheat beer."
"D: Paired very well with a mild Indian dish of Chana Saag."
"Pleasant aroma with biscuit and yeast going with little spice. Pouring into a large wine glass left little of the white head (probably a bad poor on my part). Taste is perfect for me in a white ale. The spice note are very subdued and blend well with biscuity malt and wheat character of it. I'm not a fan of zealous use of coriander so this beer really pleases the palate. It has a nice lingering aftertaste to it as well. Definitely the best white/wit ale I have tried."
"Overall, this is a pretty good witbier. Solid flavor, solid aroma, solid mouthfeel, and I think this is my first from Allagash, so I'll give them some kudos. Drinkability is pretty high because of the well-balanced blend of the aforementioned factors and the relatively low ABV. Give this a try if you see it around."
"D- I don't love it, but that's probably because I'm just not the biggest fan of the style. This a very easy drinking wit that I could sip on for hours though if this was my best choice on tap."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and full of carbonation and is much thicker than what I expected. It is also very easy to drink, goes well with just about any meal and isn't overpowering in any way. Definitely something that I need to get more of before they leave Ohio. The whole reason I picked it up in the first place."
"D: Very refreshing and it would be easy to session with this on a warm day."
"This is a wonderfully drinkable beer. It goes down easy and is delicious to boot. This bottle was picked up for me by my wife on an out of town trip. It's a bummer that this brew isn't available anywhere close to where I live. I'll definitely buy this beer anytime I come across it."
"D- easy to put back a couple of these small bottles of this. one of the benchmarks of the style. i really like this one."
"D - This is the first time I have had an Allagash beer and this has made a good first impression, good stuff."
"Overall, Allagash is certainly a good example of a witbier. It's crisp and refreshing and is a beer I'd gladly drink again. It's not hugely flavorful, but it remains very true to style and is very drinkable."
"Kind of everything I'm looking for in a wheat beer."
"(D)- A light & crisp, easy drinking beer that I could easily put away a 6pk of this. Not a ton of flavor in this, but good for what it is. A good summer brew."
"Overall-one of the best wits I've had, nice balance, flavors, tastes great, I enjoyed."
"D - Despite the mouthfeel issues, this drinks really well, and is a great introduction to Allagash."
"Golden color with light lacing, tends to hang on glass throughout. Smell and taste --both spice and citrus come through. Medium carbonation, makes for a very drinkable beer. Not as heavy as some spicy/citrus (belgian style combinations). Makes for a very nice summer or spring beer."
"D--I could sip these all day. Absolutely perfect for a spring or summer day. Pick up a 4 pack or a 750 if you can't find it on tap. This is a must have!"
"I first had this beer at Cook's Lobster House near its ""home"" in Portland, ME. This was ~2 years ago, so the fact that my memory of the time when I first had it inspired me to do a formal review today speaks volumes as to what I think about it. I basically find it to be an excellent interpretation of a common style which is sometimes bastardized by the American macrobreweries. Some despise it for this reason, but I think that you should try it even if you hold this opinion - you might change your mind."
"D: Overall a very nice brew for warm weather drinking"
"Drinkability- this beer is certain not a bad brew but to me the spice is just a tad to much to be super high rated in this category, I really love allagash but this one just doesnt do a heck of a lot for me though bad by no means, at least to my palate slight to much spice but it does keep in dry, but still very thirst quenching overall"
"D: A nice beer to drink, especially in warm weather. Somewhat light and refreshing and what you would expect for the style."
"D: Beautiful summer day beer to just sit back with and drink all day."
"some places may serve this with a wedge of lemon - I say pass, don't really need it. this is a beer that can be very refreshing in warm weather, but the flavor is exceptional enough to warrant drinking it anytime."
"D - ABV and flavors light enough for session."
"D: Drinkable, for the price don't think I'll be seeking out again."
"Drink: Very easy to drink, nice and clean. A great example of a white beer."
"D- This might have to be one of my new summer favorites. Its up there with Oberon, Paulaner Hefeweizen and Weinhenstephaner Hefe Weissebier."
"Wow i love this beer !! Poured into my duvel tulip, per instructions on the bottle. a - magical, cloudy beer, with nice frothy head. s - yeasty, spicy, like a mellowed out hefeweizen. t - the taste is like the smell. Spot on for the style ! m - chewy, like eating the ultimate happy meal. very substantial. d - i could drink these all nite and never tire of it. todays a 80 degree spring day and this refreshes to the core."
"4.45 / A"
"Drinkability - I've had this before, but waited until I had one that I could drink along with this review. This is still the best white ale I've had after trying several others. This one strikes the best balance of good taste and pizazz...the level of citrus flavor and spice in just right in my opinion and that takes this beer above some others which have quite acceptable bases and those with too much fruit and spice."
"Allagash (Witbier) White was a cloudy yellow-gold color with a modest white head that quickly dissipated to almost nothing. The aroma was an orange fruit smell and sweetness. The taste was lightly citrus, more lemony than orange, but not sweet. Some spice too (coriander?). I also got a peppery taste late, after the beer warmed up. Nothing particularly strong about the flavors in this beer. The mouth fell was light to medium bodied, oily and decent carbonation. Drinkability was better as it warmed. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of witbiers, and this one was just OK."
"Overall, this is an excellent and extremely sessionable offering from Allagash."
"D: Easily a session beer on a hot summer day."
"D - delicious. easy to drink."
"I like the fact that there are little instructions on the side of the bottle on the preferred method for pouring it into your glass, including the need to swirl the last couple ounces. I think as wits go, this one is one of my favs. Perfect hazy color, nice sweet smell, smooth taste. Purchased in a 4 pack here in Eastern PA for $9.99."
"pours a nice cloudy yellow with a fluffy white head.slight lacing.Aromas of citrus and coriander.Very drinkable with hints of orange and lemon peel as well as coriander and floral hops.Not as watery as most white ales and finishes with a clean and crisp subtle hoppiness"
"Poured nice yellow and cloudy, overall satisfactory, probably great for a hot sumer day, I would recommend it, and get it again for sure."
"Value: Pricey. I have to wonder if, for the price, someone who doesn't really LOVE white beers would ever choose this over Blue Moon at almost half the cost...I would. But the masses wouldn't."
"Cloudy yellow beer with enough sediment to earn the ""white"" label. Great looking white head that leaves some nice dots of lacing. The nose is spicy and citric, with coriander mixing beautifully into the lemongrass notes. Extremely well-made, a flagship to be proud of. The pale malts drive the flavor with mild sweetness and a depth of body rarely found in American versions of the style. Notes of exotic spices add complexity, while the orange and lemon really add a pleasing tartness overall. Very well done on all facets of a great session beer."
"D: very drinkable - great for warmer weather, not dead of winter."
"D:. I wish there was a bottled date because I think this 4 pack may have been old. it is balanced there is no over powering flavors. Lacks the pop that this style tends to have I feel as if this has been sitting around a bit to long and lost some of volatile flavors that needed to be savored young. Quite a few of these could be drank."
"Overall: I was pleasantly suprised after the poor. I was worried it would be too light, and dull. However, the flavor was very good, with a nice sweet taste."
"D - Complex and drinkable. Great brew."
"Drinkability: the strong point of Allagash White. While I feel like it was more of a hefeweizen than a witbier, I still find it extremely refreshing and drinkable. I would session tons of this stuff were it not so pricey."
"Overall: I would highly recommend this beer. Very good representation of the style."
"This was very easy to drink, very tasty and refreshing."
"Drinkability: About as drinkable as any beer can get. Very light, no bitterness just highly carbonated."
"Body was medium, with abundant carbonation and crispness. The feel was pretty slick with a chalky finish. Perhaps I didn't sample it an ideal time of year, but it was still a good refreshing brew."
"Drinkability/Overall - A good standby beer"
"D - About as drinkable as a beer can be...light and refreshing. Great as an ultimate lawnmower beer...but one with flavor! Can have a few of these in a sitting very easily. Love this beer...a go to in the summer, and still great on a cold winter night."
"O: A great Wit, but not excellent, Witbier. A little one-sided due to the lack of crisp wheat flavor that I associate with the style."
"D - Very drinkable. Definitely sessionable, especially in the summer. Might like it enough to get it again, but I don't quite see what all the fuss is about with this beer."
"This is more of a summertime beer, it is easily quaffable. Overall it isn't bad, it is more pedestrian than some of the Belgian Witbiers, more like Hoegaarden, not a bad thing if you want a lawnmower beer in humid weather but in the winter it is rather bland."
"While not my favorite style this is among the best versions out there in my opinion. Allagash's great Belgian style house yeast is well showcased keeping this from tasting like a spiced pale wheat like some American versions of the style."
"D: I'm not usually one for Wits, but the body, smell and flavors give this an impeccable drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is very good, and this is a really drinkable beer."
"I had batch no. 66. Whether there is a difference I am not sure. Pours to a cloudy yellow, with a decent head retention, but the head isn't too crazy. To me it drinks like a pilsner. Slight tastes of barley, malts without too much spice overpowering, but the coriander, and citrus elements are there, but just enough to make it enjoyable."
"D: The light body and light, smooth taste makes it quite drinkable. This one goes down fast, and leaves me ready for the next beer to taste!"
"Quite easy to drink with only a 5.2% abv."
"D: I could drink this forever."
"Served: in a weizen glass."
"Very refreshing."
"Awesome! Best Witbier I've had, seriously good. you really have to let this beer sit and wander and set in before you swallow and enjoy."
"Light wheat and citrus flavors with a lingering light lemon zest. That odd scent translates to the flavor as well, keeping the nuances at bay. Decent feel and drink and the nose does continue to improve with exposure. Overall an unexciting beer that is too sweet and rather lightly spiced for the style and a bit watery on the finish."
"D - Good but in my opinion overcarbonated. This might have been to the keg just being tapped."
"D - insanely drinkable and refreshing. great for a hot summer day yet equally quenching on a cold winter night."
"The first flavors I get are lemon based citrus, but not in a bad way or overpowering way. It is present but not dominant. This beer has light body and finishes smoothly. Drinkability is high, mouthfeel is good. There is some mild sweetness on the front of the palate and a slightly bitter / sour lemon-peel like flavor in the mid to back of the mouth. Overall a good wit."
"But we won't argue semantics - the brewery called this a 'white' beer and they are free to interpret that vague style according to whatever attributes or ingredients or methods inspire them to. Besides, I'd say that whatever they were aiming for, it worked! This turned out well - very well. Regardless of style, all beers are meant to be at least a handful of things: appealing, tasty and drinkable. This has all those qualities in spades."
"This is a great Belgian White, and I think one of the best ones I've had. I'll admit that I thought it was a tad bland when I took my first sip, but let this beer warm up a little more before you make a final judgment."
"Buy Again? Possibly (it is possible I got a bad beer), but I’d rather try something new."
"12oz bottle (no longer being bottled in 750ml), no date - purchased at the brewery 11/5/09, consumed 11/6/09, poured into an Allagash chalice. A tight pristine white, one finger head settles on top of a cloudy, straw yellow body - great yeast suspension. The nose is of tropical fruit, citrus, spice, and some light grassy notes. Tastes of light maltiness, orange peel and spice upfront, a very pleasant dry, lightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light and zippy, great carbonation, dry. This is a great warm weather thirst quencher, goes great with food, especially spicy or fatty dishes, I could drink these all day during the warmer months."
"this was a gift at our house warming..i have had it before..dont know after this experience that ill be back"
"D - Terrific drinkability. Solid from start to finish. Easily recommended."
"M&D: The absoloute quintessence of smoothness and drinkability, refreshing and completely non-offensive ( in any way!) this beer is a nice summer session brew."
"Drinkability- I could easily drink more than a few of these on a hot day."
"Drinkability: This is a beer to enjoy, to savor and to drink again. Allagash White is very clean, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This is very drinkable beer that I'll revisit again and again."
"Notes: A nice wheat beer that has become a standard for the style in the US. It may be a touch over-hyped but it is a great beer and fantastic to have as a craft choice."
"More of a belgian pale or blonde to my taste than a witbier. Not quite as esthery and mellower than a wit. Very tasty, good belgian yeast flavor, great light gold color, great carbonation and low enough alcohol by volume to be very drinkable. Great beer."
"This is a very decent witbier, and I think its justified in being so highly regarded. Its not quite as good as St. Bernardus, but I'd be happy to have this available all the time."
"To say this beer is robust is a criminal understatement. The scents and flavors emanating therefrom are almost as intoxicating as the ale itself. Make no mistake, this is a hearty beer, but it goes well with all things; steak, chicken, pasta, relaxing after a sweaty round of golf, it just hits the proverbial spot. Its both sweet and malty with faint aromas and undertones of bitter spices. Allagash White is not the kind of beer that I could drink all night and day, but one or two really take take the edge off and just taste great while doing so. If I can think of anything bad about this beer it could only be the price. I've only seen it in a four-pack and those run around 8 to 10 bucks each. But I guess sometimes you just have to spoil yourself."
"Overall there's not a whole lot this witbier can do better - one of the more refreshing ones I've had. Definitely worth the shot."
"D - When I want to be refreshed, this is what I look for, not some ""light lager"" junk. I wish they came in six packs rather then four. It's probably for the best though, I think the six would go just as quick as four, and they are just at the price range where that could easily add up."
"This beer is the best Witbier I have had. It's much smoother than others I have tried, and I really like the hint of banana finish on the end. Will definitely buy again."
"Note: I suspect these bottles may be on their way to being old. No freshenss date, and when I asked at the counter if this was popular I was told they don't sell a lot of it (probably the answer to 99% of craft and micro beers). I had a sample of this beer another time that was a lot better and probably fresher. I'm not sure you can expect these to fly off the shelves because of the ridiculous price and four pack format. For the money, I'd rather go with hoeegarden, which is more likley to be fresh, and a lot cheaper. Allagash, start putting these in six packs and I'll regularly buy it."
"Such a fantastic beer. I wish I could by this in 12 packs."
"Very light and foggy appearance. Moderately carbonated. Small, crystal white head. Aroma guarantees a great experience. Not too strong, not too weak flavor, just right. Not extremely complex, but a damn fine flavor. Great mouthfeel and highly drinkable."
"A good beer, not great. Something that is worth a try. Not my favorite from Alagash though."
"Wow! This was really, really, good stuff. I recently reviewed Shock Top, and said that A-B got it 'mostly right'. I still stand by that statement, but the Allagash reminded me that's a there's a big difference between mostly right and all right."
"D - Good drinkability but not something I'd rush out for. A lovely summer brew that will quench the thirst in the heat. Again, really good layering of flavors in this one."
"The rich frothy collar rests atop the lemon cloudy brew and suggests a white aurora towards the bottom of the pint glass. Aromas reminiscent of lemon zest, coriander, Creamsicle, and some faint bubblegum powder in the back. Citrus (lemon and orange) flavors, toasted cracker, pale wheat, clove, and a noticeable hop profile create a wonderfully balanced beer that concludes with an effervescent carbonation."
"Spongy lacing."
"Cheers!!"
" Hats off to another great beer by Allagash!"
"Drink is excellent I couldn't see why anyone wouldn't love to have a few of these. Very sessionable and light for those hot days. I am not really a big Witbier fan but this one is easily my favorite so far."
"Had of tap at a local pub in s tall stemmed drinking vessel. Nice color.. cloudy straw yellow with a decent head. Spicy aroma, hints of some lemon and grain. Taste of yeast, citrus, some spice, with a hint of banana and orange. Crisp and clean on the palate, very refreshing. A good representation of a Wit,... worth seeking out."
"A well balanced head appeared apon pouring. The color of the beer was a hazy/cloudy light yellow.The aroma was slightly spicy with small notes of citrus. The form and flavor of the beer itself was fantastic.. The form stayed true to the classic white but the brewer added a more bitter flavor to the beer which contrasts well with the spices and citrus notes. This beer is very drinkable, it's not overly carbinated. it's light but has a strong flavor."
"M/D: Medium-bodied and refreshing; very good session beer."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is very mild, some hints of clove and citrus. Taste is delicious. There is so much going on here, spices, cloves, citrus, all blended perfectly together. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a fine beer."
"Nice example of the witbier. Well-rounded without being too spicy, maintaining a good yeast funk and thirst quenchability."
"This is just a great example of the style. Highly recommended."
"The taste is quite tart. There are nice florals underneath, and a citrus tartness that is very nice. The beer has some nice yeastiness, and bit of a floral, orange rind, lemony snap to it that really shows up on the tongue. The beer is like a lemony seltzer spritzer. There is a bit of a saltene cracker saltiness to the beer as well, with some mouth puckering acerbicness towards the back end. The clove tastes emerge here as well. This is a nice beer, very enjoyable, light, refreshing, and just the ticket when the temp gets up there."
"Very good brew."
"D: Very drinkable ale to complement lighter meals."
"This is a great crisp, light, refreshing beer. Is easy drinking and only lightly carbonated."
"D: It was very easy to drink, refreshing, and overall a very enjoyable experience."
"A Great beer, but for it will usually be priced fairly high - perhaps too high."
"D: Very drinkable, a great example of the style, probably the best I've had."
"I would prefer more citrus and less spice, but then again thats not what this is about, so i'll stick to shock top untill i can find a better beer that has a flavor more in line with my tastes"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. it has everything that a Good Belgian Witbier requires. It's appearance keeps you interested. Smell is relaxing. Taste is complex. Mouthfeel is interesting. This is my favorite Witbeir so far. Goes great with Hawaiian chicken, pineapple, or by itself on a warm late summers evening."
"D- This beer as it is is not drinkable at all. This beer from what I remembered as in the past was a enjoyable beer. Maybe if I get this beer again I'll re-review this beer. But as it stands with this bottle it is bad."
"The body was typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller. As with most Wits this is a very drinkable beer. Worth seeking out."
"D - This is a very easy drinking brew. I could see myself drinking a lot of this great tasting wit."
" summer months."
"I dont know about this one...Maybe I'm just not a Belgian White ""witbier"" kinda guy but is it me or does every Belgian White beer smell like Easter Ham? The appearance of this beer is awesome...super cloudy from the yeast..I love that...it doesnt taste bad, but I wouldnt say it was good either. Would'nt dump it but def. would'nt buy it again...sorry for the confusing review..should have left this one alone."
"This is quite the tasty wit. Its the perfect summer time quaffer. It does quite the job in extinguishing the heat from these boar sausages I'm enjoying. Nicely done Allagash."
"750 ml brown bottle obtained at McKinnon's Meat Market. Poured into an Allagash Tulip. Hazy gold with an inch of head that dissipated within a minute and a half of being served. citrusy, spicy coriander. taste of orange rind, spice, and doughy/bready aftertaste. moderate carbonation. good quality, refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. The flavor isn't everything I would like, but the ABV is pretty mild. Mediocre."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice head, minimal lacing. Smells of orange, grassy? Taste is mild and refreshing, hints of ornage and coriander, grass, pine, a nice balance. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability is high. If I had to make a short list of beers that I would want to drink if I had to drink many of one kind, this would be on it."
"The aroma has notes of spice, lemon, and grass, but is not that strong. The taste is very fresh with coriander, wheat, and a bit of citrus. A tiny bit of malt in the finish. Carbonation is strong. This beer is easy drinking and refreshing on a hot day."
"Tastes of corainder and lemon italian ice with a beatifull musty yeasty feel. Nice citrus/spice balance, it's sessionable yet full of flavor. I'm a fan."
"D: Very easy to drink. An almost perfect summer beer."
"On tap in Portland, ME. Had a white, good-sized head. Body was hazy with a dark-yellow color. Nice lacing. Aroma was strong with citrus (orange), but not at all overpowering. Nice on the palate, slightly creamy with average carbonation. Great flavor - citrusy, with a medium-lasting finish. A great witbier that was enjoyed on a sunny deck on the waterfront... quite possibly the best witbier I've had yet."
"D- Highly drinkable. Very interesting... it smelled like it wanted to be a tripel, yet tasted like it wanted to be a hefeweizen. Not really either."
"While I expected a lot from Allagash White, each category just screamed average to me. Maybe I'll try it bottled next time, but I wouldn't seek out this wit again on tap."
"An unbelievable beer to look at and taste. By far, the best wit beer in the states and perhaps the world. Makes Hoegaarden look like Bud light, well, maybe not that bad. Love it!"
"All-in-all, a very tasty brew. Recommended. My Dad brought this over to my house - believe he bought it at the Class VI store at Fort Belvoir, VA."
"Looks like some dense lemonade. Tastes like candy corn and lemon to be exact. The wheat and other spices are in the background for me. Actually reminded me very much of Alesmith Horny Devil, only lighter tasting. Somewhat refreshing on a warm night and pretty easy to drink. Good kick of carbonation that seems appropriate for the style. Don't know how much I really like this style of beer, but this one is quite drinkable and interesting enough."
"Very good witbier. Definitely the best one I've had to date. I could drink this at any time for any occasion. Great flavors and a great beer. This is a great offering from Allagash. Very refreshing."
"Small foamy white head over an unfiltered yellow to light golden. The head retains just a ring of retention. A nose of predominantly wheat and citrus. Tastes of refreshing wheat flavors, coriander and other spices at the front. A lemon citrus hop bite comes in, but it's nothing against the wheat and spices. Orange bitterness in there as well. Ripe, sugary fruit pull through with a little bit of time. Medium body crispness and oh so smooth. This is such a great beer to cool down with. Very fitting for the style!"
"drinkability- great beer, great taste, great feel, great after taste. no doubt i will buy this again and will soon, hopefully to pair with some foods."
"This is one of the nicest white beers I have had."
"Highly drinkable. If you're not into these particular spices, the finish could leave you wanting to switch after one. Its not a beer for someone looking for a bland summer lager. Its a complex beauty with a myriad of different tastes. Enjoy."
"Lively, with lots of carbonation on the palate. What I'd expect in a wit, and done well. The coriander starts to get a little heavy toward the bottom of the glass, but not burdensome. Overall a great wit, and understandably on of the top versions."
"Notes - The mouthfeel was good and this is just a solid witbier I've had it with lemon and without and its a little more refreshing with the lemon. This is an awesome summer beer."
"*EDIT: Head formation and retention was better the next day, poured more forcefully from the same bottle."
"D- Well even with this full mouthfeel it is light on the stomach, and if it weren't for the price this would be a delicious session beer."
"A real summer treat."
"Easily drinkable, especially on a summer afternoon. A crisp, light, enjoyable session beer."
"When I had this on-tap it was nowhere near as good."
"A bright golden yellow color, with a puffy white head, that laces slowly and clings every so slow down the glass. A zesty aroma of lemon with a yeasty spiciness, along with the classic scents of coriander and orange zest. The light, bread like wheat flavor comes out right away and hugs the palate. That is when the zesty citrus flavors take over, it finishes with a splash of coriander on the back of the palate. Refreshing feel, light, but not watery. The cleansing sensation of carbonation tickles the back of each taste. This is an excellent beer, great with seafood and after a hot day mowing the lawn."
"Poured a cloudy pale blonde. Fluffy head with pretty good retention. Lemon seems to be the strongest scent, then followed by banana and peppery spice. Quite a lot of carbonation, which adds to the refreshing taste of this beer. I really enjoy witbiers and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. The taste has the aforementioned lemon and banana combined with a nice hint of yeast. For me, the taste of pepper lingered the strongest after the swallow. Thumbs up on this one."
"The appearance of this beer is a cloudy yellow with a nice white head as it was poured from the bottle. Had little floaties left from the yeast. The nose was full of yeast and spice about what you should expect from a witbier. Taste was good again full of wheat and spice flavor, with a yeast note also. Mouthfeel was light and crisp, with carbonic note from the carbonation. Overall nice witbier good for summertime drinking after a liitle yard work or during a backyard BBQ. Would drink this again."
"Great for a BBQ in the back yard!"
"D- the best wit i've had in a long while (i think). tough call between allagash and ommegang for my favorite american interpretations. definitely will be seeing this one again in the hotter months."
"Smooth with fairly high carbonation and high drinkability. Not much more I could ask for from this style of beer. Excellent."
"m: Smooth and well carbonated."
"Always good, bottle-conditioned or on draught, Allagash has become a happily anticipated summer beer of choice, and one that shows that witbiers can be made well here! The pour is smooth but full-looking, wheat-yeast hazy yellow and leaves a nice creamy-dense head floating on an opaque yellow. The head is a nice solid, creamy hint of citrus & spice and the white lace clings thereafter to prove a nice point. The aroma exudes obvious lemon, but also tangerine, wet grass & spices from pepper to coriander. The body is smooth and silky like the head, although a bit more straight forward, while the spices definitely emerge in complexity. Bright, smooth and clean, this wit puts a smile on your face and settles nicely on a warm day...hope in a bottle!"
"YOU MUST TRY THIS BEER AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION TIMES BEFORE YOU DIE"
"D - Very hard to beat the taste of this American Wit. A top example for sure in the category for me. I just love the yeast flavor profile and the spices are used without a heavy hand keeping it fresh and refreshing. It refreshes to the core -don't hesitate to pick this up especially since it works for summer well."
"I poured into a nonic to an inch of head. It is pale yellow in color and cloudy. The smell is citrus and spice. The taste is wonderful. It reminds me of my vacation in Maine last summer where I discovered this tasty treat. It is great for drinking on a hot summer day or as is the case, a warm spring day."
"Wonderful beer."
"Very easy to drink. Light flavors that are well-complemented against each other and a manageable abv."
"D: One of the best witbiers out there and easily the best value of the bunch. It give a wide palate of aromas and flavors yet it is superiorly drinkable."
"D: A session beer if there was any. Would recommend to fans of all styles, foes not included."
"Hazy light yellow appearance. Visible yeast and poured with little head. There was not much body/carbonation. I got a strong yeast smell. The taste started with lemon tones and also detected banana. I was a little dissapointed. Not sure if I just got a bad bottle but the flavor and body was lacking from what I remembered having on tap. I will give this another try."
"D: This has been a go-to beer for me for a good while. I'd say this is the best wit in America, possibly the world."
"12oz. Poured a cloudy yellow with a white head that had good retention and left decent lacing on the glass. Aromas were of Belgian yeasts, spice, and citrus with faint hints of fresh, ripe blueberries and cherries. Mouth-feel is thicker than anticipated with a pleasant carbonation allowing all the flavors to coat the palate - Belgian yeast, wheat, lemon, banana, and spices. Refreshing with a dry finish - quickly asks you to take another sip. Solid brew - I need to try more Allagash!"
"Pale peach flesh goldenrod color with an off white head. Hazy body and okay retention/lacing. Aroma is wheaty with a lot of banana pith and a kiss of coriander. Flavor is again laden with banana pith, but there's more complexity than in the aroma. Coriander is still there but it's joined by a light lemony tartness and some citrus zest. Slightly sweet doughiness paired with the citrus evokes lemon bar pastries (although not nearly as sharp or sweet). Body is thin enough to be refreshing but not too flimsy to carry the flavor. Carbonation is just a touch high, but it's soft enough to avoid being distracting. Overall this is a very good witbier but it lacks the depth and variety of ester notes of the best Belgian examples."
"D: As stated above, the perfect summer beer--next time you're out in warm weather, see if you can find a small bottle of this; you won't regret it."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop. Poured into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a cloudy muted apricot color with about an inch of fluffy white foam. Smells and tastes of spicy yeast, citrus such as lemon and orange, slightly bitter, slightly sweet. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. This beer is part of my regular rotation in the DBF."
"D - Such a great witbier. I've recently become very partial to witbiers and this is definitely the best I have had thus far. It's nearly perfect in every way. If it weren't so expensive you'd probably be able to make a session beer out of it."
"Allagash White poured a nice amber/orange color. Nice white head, and very good lacing. The smell was of citrus and spice. The taste was of citrus/orange, and hints of spice. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability was good as well, easy drinker. Overall this is spot on for the style."
"I would drink again."
"so far, no disappointments, and many, many pleasant american wheat beers. rank Allagash among the top."
"Cloudy pale gold with a two finger white head. Fair amount of lacings. Aroma of floral hops and grass. Taste is mild bready, grass, wild yeast, with a mildly bitter hop flavor. Very smooth drinker and quite sessionable. The hickory or boiled ham notes are minimal which made this a pleasant beer for me."
"This is a great, refreshing witbier--the best witbier I've tried and a top choice on a hot day. I'm partial to wits, and this is no exception, so as far as drinkability goes, I could definitely go for another."
"Very refreshing in an almost impossible way... The best wit I've had with actualy great flavor.... What some other wits wish to be"
"Beer was good but not as good as some other wit beers that I have had. However, on a hot day I definitely would not hesitate to buy and drink this beer. Very smooth and refreshing."
"The level of carbonation in the taste put me off a bit: a bit too tingly to fully notice the flavors. Still, a nice American Wit."
"Got this one in a caged up 750ml. It went into the tumbler with an excellent pillowy white head the pushed above the rim of the glass before settling back down to a constant fluffy layer, a little darker than I would expect when compared to the style standard Hoegaarden. On the nose is a definite coriander and barnyard hay with the lightest cinnamon hint intermixed with some citrus notes. Taste is fairly standard; wheat and coriander dominate with light orange and yeast notes. The coriander seems to add a slight astringency that leaves the mouth dry with the hop bitterness accentuating this, which is what I would say, is the most significant issue this beer has. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, one that I will likely see my shopping cart again, but sadly not quite as good as the hype had me expecting."
"M & D, this is a medium bodied wheat beer that goes down very easy. I could drink this throughout the entire summer."
"D 4.0 cleanest witbier to date in look and taste, great subtle balanced taste, unique and respectable for the style"
"Please dont ruin these types of beers with a orange slice...please people."
"A pretty simple review here. Very refreshing brew, one of my favorite warm weather session beers. Light citrus, yeast, spice and grass. Perfect for summer evenings on the deck with the smell of fresh cut lawn all around. Clean and crisp mouth with and finishes dry. Infinitely drinkable and delicious."
"D. good beer. Could have a few, nothing too great though. But definitely a beer that I could drink through the night, considering it's low alc content. I don't see why they would price it so high however."
"Final Thoughts - Allagash scores big here. By far my favorite Belgian-inspired American made witbier. Love this one time and time again. Recommended."
"overall - Just a hair below Troublette and above Ommegang Witte and Hoegaarden in my top Witbier list. I will definitely keep an eye out for this one in the future. A delectable brew."
"Drinkability- Bud Light has nothing on Allagash White's drinkability. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I enjoyed the hell out of this beer. I think I can safely say this is the best wit I've had to date. I'll have to revisit some others, but the aroma, balance, and feel are what other breweries should be aiming for. Allagash usually turns me off with their price tags, but if they put out more affordable 12oz bottles like this, I'd gladly make them a go to brewery of mine."
"I found this beer to be a solid Witte door-opener. It was very simple in terms of the conglomerate of flavors that comprised it and thus I rated it very high on drinkability. This is the beer I would drink if I were to decide to consume a 144 ounces of goodness on a Friday night. It was very easy to consume and very flavorful."
"Pale and a little cloudy, not much retention. Smells of good Belgian yeast, wheat, butter, some citrus and spices. First taste is pretty much the same, the Belgian yeast is my favorite part and the various citrus flavors (orange, lemon and a little apricot) surface slowly and bring a pleasant complexity. Very refreshing, lighter body, very easy to drink, and a great example of a traditional Belgian Wit."
"D - Good, but I really can't picture myself having more than two or three. Of course, I generally don't drink more than two or three (of anything) in one sitting."
"I could instantly feel spring approaching when this was first sipped. It lived up to its reputation, a pleasure to taste"
"D~ Awesome brew. Allagash Brew Co, Nice Job . You have a new fan. I'm going to need more than the single I bought in my mix a six. :o)"
"Notes: What I am not sure is the price. Sure enough on tap it would be even more costly but at about $3 a bottle it is a bit extreme."
"Easily a very drinkably witbier. Good flavor, not heavy on the palate, and doesn't wreck your palate. Looking forward to more of these..."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours with a decent white head that fades into decent lacing. Color is cloudy dark yellow with little transparency. The carbination is fairly low. Smell is of sweet yeast and fruity scents very nice. Taste is slightly sweet, with yeast and some spices, just tasty. Finishes with hints of the spices but clean. Mouthfeel is very good, has some consistency to it, not too thick very easy to drink. This beer to me is a great afternoon beer, not too heavy, refreshing, and very a wonderful taste."
"Allagash white was actually the first craft brew I drank many years ago and i keep coming back to it year after year. I can't get enough of it."
"Poured a clear gold with no head.I got a lot of wheat on the nose with a touch of citrus. The taste is nice, wheaty with a little balance of honey sweetness. The sweetness was made this beer a good drinker, I could drink several of these and go on with my day!"
"cloudy, yellow pour, nice head. similar smell to many belgian beers, and this is no exception: yeasty, banana, and some mild spices. some faint banana in taste but it is really a gentle citrus flavor that defines this one. i like how spices like coriander and nutmeg are relegated to the background. fizzy mouthfeel, but incredibly easy to drink -- this is the strongest component of the beer. i find allagash white is a great introduction to more complex beers for newbies. always a pleasant surprise to find this on tap."
"D: Very nice brew. Somewhat complex with the flavors and mouthfeel. I will be grabbing more of these..."
"Drinkability - Very good beer."
"Mouthfeel is light but creamy at the same time, never watery. Delicious."
"On tap from Rattle and Hum NY. Pours with a nice thick heavy head which lasts fairly long. Thick lacing. Color is a pale dark yellow and very cloudy. Smell is pleasant with an earthy tone. Taste is also very pleasant with both hints of both wheat and citrus. As a slightly heavier beer it is filling but still maintains good drinkability. Would definitely drink this beer again."
"D- excellent this could be drunk every day and I would not get tired of it. What a great great beer."
"The best wheat beer variety I've tried to date. The mellowness of the yeast and wheat in combination with how well balanced this one is, put it in a class of its own."
"D - This would be a great beer to crack open on the beach!"
"This will probably be a staple in the fridge. I can't wait for the summer to have some shelfish and a few of these."
"this beer was very up and down. more carbonation would go a long way."
"D: I know everyone thinks this is a rock star session beer and I love spice but this isn't the one I would hang out with for a session. Even though I did tap the bottle by myself."
"D - Not horrible but not something I would reach for again"
"Holy shit is this drinkable! Had a hard time not slamming it. I normally drink bigger beers and sip more slowly, but this one goes down like keg beer at a frat party."
"Glowing cloudy yellow color, almost like it's radioactive, still you can see the tiny bubbles swim to the surface. Not much head nor lacing. Subtly fills your nostrils with sheer weight as well as clove, coriander spice, lemon peel, vanilla bean, has a lively yeastiness, some banana notes, while light of touch it's never not there. Light-bodied, fizzy and kind of skittish, never settles down on a branch. The heavier carbonation does whip up the clove led spices, lemon to orange citrus, mineral water and mild metallic flakes. The fruit mainly banana, pear, apricot, more skin and pit than flesh. Creates a lot of perfume in the mouth yet cannot persist through the finish. Goes down without a hiccup."
"on-tap at matchbox in chinatown, dc"
"D- Incredibly drinkable, if it were not such a high price I could easily finish 4-6 bottles in a sitting."
"D - extremely drinkable i dont know why ths style doesn't eventually substitute all the light crap. HAHa"
"Pours a pale orange with plenty of carbonation to form a two-finger, fluffy, off-white head. Retention is good, with a fine layer of lacing left behind. Has a aroma of orange peel. Tastes big on coriander, with some citrus notes and grain coming through as well. Light-bodied and very tasty wit that should quench anybody's thirst for a crisp, unfiltered session brew."
"D - YUMMMMYYY yummy yummy I got allagash white in tummy. good beer. didn't like too much the first times I had it it tasty beverage."
"D- Excellent. I could drink quite a few of these."
"T. Fairly light and smooth while being a little over carbonated for my liking. Slight lemon and very insignificant hints of zestier orange. This is a perfect summer time beer, not much too it, not much to think about, and pretty refreshing. Maybe a little too plain for my liking though."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Very drinkable. This is a very good beer and I think it will become one of my go-tos."
"Edited 2/4/09: I really like variety but this has become a staple in my fridge. I absolutely love this beer. The balance, the spice, everything about it. I can't recommend it too highly. Do yourself a favor and pick this up."
"a great North American versian of a witbier, very reasonably priced.. In my opinon along with Blanche De Chambly, and Victory Whirlwind the best wheat beers in North Amercia"
"Poured a cloudy yellow color with a niced head. Smell was citrusy with hint of cloves. Taste was smooth with a nice malt bacbone and with a nice lively citrus flavor. Nice carbonation, not overwhelming. I could have three of these and be very happy and not be sloppy."
"D: Good session beer, but not so impressive and flavorful that I'll seek this out over 'average' and cheaper witbiers."
"D - This is a nice brew...I still haven't worked my taste buds up to the heavy wheat beers yet...a little spicy"
"Lemon yellow pour with a medium white head and mild lacing, nice and cloudy. Soft aroma with a nice delicate flowery nose coupled with mild spices. Mouthfeel is an odd blend of creamy smooth and fizzy, weird but kind of nice. Flavor seems more delicate than the aroma, nice light citrus flavor of lemon and orange. The spices aren't as prevalent but are still noticeable. Extremely quenching and satisfying, but I prefer my Wits to be a little more assertive."
"Still a good offering for their standard."
"Overall: It was creamy with a medium to full body beer The finish was quick but subtle. This is not a bad beer has more flavor than Hoegaarden."
"The best Witbier I've had, hands down."
"A pretty good brew - worth checking out. Could perhaps just use a little more intensity in it's flavor and nose..."
"This beer is amazing. Probably the most complex beer I have ever tasted. There is so much going on in this giant bottle that I couldn't even begin to describe the taste to anyone. Truely has to be tried to be appreciated."
"A little thin on the mouthfeel but the drinkabilty is wonderful. Dry, clean, and crisp on the finish. Thanks to lithy for this one."
"Has a different spice to it than the bland one other breweries have and seems cloudier somehow? Either way this beer is delicious and I wish my local beer store carried more Allagash products [this is the only one :-(]"
"D: Overall a decent drinking wit, nice flavor and drinkability but really didn't grab my attention liked I hoped it would."
"I will have this again. I am not a big wit beer guy, but certain deliciousness transcends styles and tastes."
"Overall a fantastic witbier. Very drinkable, and the blend of citrus and spices with have me drinking this one again very soon. I am impressed enough to start moving through the other Allagash products."
"D- Not a huge fan of this beer so I don't really find it drinkable. Too much citrus for me."
"Reviewed 3/18/08. On tap at Plan B, served with a slice of orange. Pours a cloudly yellow with slight white head. Tastes of your typical Belgian witbier with a nice blend of spices in the finish. Good, refreshing beer but make sure you drink it while it's still cold. 6/4/7/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"Had on tap. Poured to a hazy golden yellow with thin white head that lingered for a short while and left marginal lacing. Nose was citrus and floral, with good spices; allthough these did not translate as well in the flavor. Mouthfeel a decent blend of the fruity hops and a touch of malt sweetness. Clean taste with a nice smooth finish. Not bad."
"It tastes like what all white wheat ales should taste like. It is somewhat crisp, and not overly sour. It is pretty easy to find in even a medium sized beer store, if you see it pick it up and give it a shot!"
"Pours a hazy pale yellow-orange with plenty of bubbles rising to form a two-finger, fluffy, off-white head. Retention is good, with a fine layer of lacing left behind. Smells of coriander and orange peel. Tastes big on the coriander, with some citrus notes and grain coming through as well. Light-bodied and very tasty wit that should quench anybody's thirst for a crisp, unfiltered session brew."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with thin white head. Citrus fruit aroma consisitng of lemon peel and peppery zest. Quaffable session beer with a lot of citrus lemon peel and orange flavor along witha nice peppery lemon zest. Soft carbonation up front followed by a citrus sweetness that lasts until the end."
"D - Only decent, driven by mouthfeel and taste, which I though were a bit lacking. This was nice to try, but I'll stick with other wits I have preferred."
"One of the most interesting beers to come out of Maine, it pours a nice amber color. The smell is very compatible with the taste, as it is possible to notice strong scents of spices, herbs and citrus. The spicy taste is easy to handle, but isn't outstanding. Has a nice full body and is certainly worth a try."
"Soft drinkable beer."
"Notes from 06/07/04."
"The aroma is bananas, cloves, lemon grass, pepper, and of course wheat. The appearance is golden with a white cloudiness. The flavor is nutmeg, coriander, citrus, banana, and malt. The palate is thin but acceptable. Overall very nice. This was my first beer for 2006 and a good way to welcome in the new year."
"The taste is light with grain, bubblegum, citrus, hint of spices, with grain and banana in the finish. It's smooth, soft, and a little oily, but with some zestiness. It's easy to drink and tasty, very good for a witbier."
"A really good Witbier. This one could become a favorite."
"This has to be one of my favorite Witbiers. Very well balanced, all around great beer."
"Bottle drank in the awesome Clark Street Ale House in Chicago. Pours a cloudy orange color with a thick white head. The aroma is full of spices; especially corriander and lemon peel. The flavor was also tons of spices, a smooth malt, some citrus and banana, and overall a easy and simple beer to drink with a nice thick mouthfeel and lots of flavor."
"Pours a very cloudy very pale yellow color, medium sized head, but it's diminishing. An aroma of citrus, spices, and some alcohol. A dry aroma. Fizzy taste, somewhat watery body. Some taste of spices, and citrus. Not a lot of flavor, I was expecting more. Somewhat watery."
"D: A thirst quencher and good representation of style."
"(From a limited, dated journal): cloudy, lemony color with a very nice head - lots of perfect little white bubbles that last. Good fruity, spicy hop aroma. Medium-bodied with a smooth and bright texture. Dry, crisp, and delicious. Got hints of passionfruit near the end, reminded me of Michael Jackson's TV series."
"D-A hard one not to like. Spices and fruit meld well with the supportive wheat body. All totaled this equates into an easy to drink and tasty brew. Plus at 5% it becomes a nice summer session beer to have on hand for those bbq gatherings."
"The mouthfeel is nice, creamy bubbles, crisp. The tangy wheat flavor is great, it's this coriander that I don't care for too much...too reminiscent of the grassy flavor that dominates beers like Blue Moon. Nowhere near as bad as that, but the type of coriander in beers like Hoegaarden works much better. Well made but not one I will personally go to again."
"D- This is a tremendous beer. It's a shame I cannot get this locally. I would love to have this with a bacon and eggs breakfast. @5% I can easily put away the 750ml bottle I received in trade with JoeyBeerBelly. Thanks man!"
"D - Unique and enjoyable... Regal and sophisticated..."
"m - good carbonation and an all around solid drink."
"Perfect beer when you are not in the mood for a heavy brew."
"Velvety mouthfeel with a tad more sticky tongue at the swallow than I expected. Quite drinkable and a viable session, though not sure how much I would want to drink a Belgian Wheat all night long. This is exactly what I look for in the style, and would send somebody to Allagash for what I think an American Belgian White should be."
"D: Overall a real good offering and a good representative of the style that I'm real glad I tried. Still, this wasn't quite in the class of Southampton, further convincing me that they are the best of the best. Still, I was impressed and will give some other Allagash offerings a shot."
"-ajh"
"If I had five more, I'd have zero in short order."
"Drinkability: Well balanced and easy drinking Wit."
"Drinkability: High. The carbonation and the mix of the satisfying malts/grains/yeast with the light and interesting finish makes me want to have another."
"Great beer at any time. Would buy again and recommend."
"D - Definitely drinkable in mass quantity, I'd definitely buy it by the case instead of the 4pak"
"Notes: Very well done!!!"
"What an excellent beer! It offers so much to the senses, is great on the palate, and leaves you craving another sip to experience more."
"A very good example of the belgian white style, probably one of my favorites, it especially gets point for the creamyness factor. Not a very unique beer but definately one I'd like to have again."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I can have more than one of these very easily, summer day or not. Pretty refreshing. Great wit."
"D - Very drinkable. Light with good flavours. Refreshing."
"D: This is highly drinkable. Perfect summer beer. I like it, but I can't say it is exceptional...not too complex."
"Mouth feel is light and refreshing. Carbonation really brightens the flavor. Drinkability is quite nice and I really enjoyed these."
"a pineapple tint with the cloud of a wheat. not too big of a head but carbonation remains within the glass, mildly. not an assertive taste for a wit. come coriander, and orange peel as expected with the style, but also much more herbs. something along the line of clove, rosemary, thyme. not sure very delicate, but surprisingly earthy. very american. very dry for a wit. crisp. easy to drink, casually or as a beer snob. haven't found a better american wit."
"Very sharp and acidic, with the carbonation stinging my tongue. Body is light to medium. Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite witbiers. Refreshing, mild and very, very drinkable."
"Good cold beer on a hot weird day"
"This is probably my second favorite witbier after the Celis White. I'll have to pick up a bottle of this sometime."
"Not much aroma. Poured with a light, fine, white head and a bit of lace. Hazy yellow color. A bit citrus. Kind of indistinct. Sort of crisp. Ok beer. Don't pick up any of the spice. Not a bad finish. What finish there is though, is short lived. Be good to cook with."
"pours up a pale golden color with a big white head. the nose consists of spices, it is chalky, musty, yeasty, notes of coriander, banana, slight lemon aroma. the taste is dry, chalky (not in a bad way), slight lemon, banana, medium body, meduim carbo. Good session beer!"
"Overall- Good sweet/sour Wit. A solid session."
"Drinkability- Very high, on a hot day this is great"
"Good against goat cheese. Great with salads."
"D- A beer I will certainly look for again on a hot day."
"Pours a light blonde, mildly cloudy, with a very thick head that had decent retention. Smells of spice, wheat and citrus. Feels very light and crisp in the mouth with mild carbonation. It's very smooth. It's got a good taste and is well balanced. Tastes citrusy with a touch of spice and has a mild bitter aftertaste. It's very easy to drink and my glass disappeared in a hurry."
"D- A great beer."
"im tellin you...try this beer if you havent."
"Pours a yellow almost cream color topped with very little head. Citrus spiced aroma, mild but pleasant. Spicy citrus flavor seemingly consisting of orange and banana. Mouthfeel is a tad thin and after the initial citrus flavor it turns somewhat bland and watery in the finish. Refreshing and very easy drinking. A nice choice in the hot sun but it's too expensive for what you get."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Bready and dry with a subtle spiciness. Light-bodied, crisp, highly carbonated. Mild malty sweetness in the middle. Spicy, faintly herbal bitterness in the finish (orange peel and sage come to mind, though more likely coriander was used)."
"overall, a very enjoyable summer session beer. one of the better North American beer of this style. I would buy this again."
"Poured out of the tap at American Flatbread a cloudy golden color. Clearly a Belgian style, unfiltered wit bier. Good white head composed of tiny bubbles. Nice retention and some broken lacing. Very inviting aromas of spices and fruit, pepper, coriander, cloves, lemon, and orange. Flavors are similarly spicy with more of a semi-sweet character that remains on the palette. Light/medium body and pleasantly effervescent. A great example of the style and one of the best on this side of the world."
"Overall, the brew is very refreshing that i would like to drink on a hot summer day."
"D- It's a little heavy for such a light beer."
"Pours closer to a lemon drop yellow with even more clouding yeast. The yeast is a bit more pronounced in the nose. The taste is much the same but with a stronger lemony, grassy taste(lemon grass maybe? lol). Carbonation isn't as good as on tap. Drinkability is still great."
"Drinkability is great, this is a world class wit, very tasty and easy drinking, perfect for summer."
"Nicely drinkable, good beer."
"Pours a pale golden with a thin white head. Not much retention and just a bit of lacing. Aroma is of bananna,spices and floral hops. Body is medium and carbonated. Taste is of sweet dark fruits and spice. Nice little bit of tang in the finish. Excellent!"
"Poured a nice orangy-yellow that started pretty clear but once the entire bottle was split between two tumblers, the color turned even cloudier with a big thicket of white foam. Aroma of malted wheat, orange zest and coriander typical of the style. Seemed to have a watery aftertaste yet that mouthfeel told me that this one seemed to have more body that most Belgian whites. Very drinkable, though. I'd buy one again."
"D: Very easy drinking beer. No problem polishing off this 4 pack, but show some restraint tonight."
"On this site it says 5.0% Alc/vol but bottle says 5.2%. Small deviation but don't know if it has changed."
"Serving type: 12 oz bottle"
"Poured a nice straw colored yellow with massive carbonation. The head was white and massive and a clean white. Nose was yeast, citrus,light matls, wheat and some spice. Taste was citrus, wheat, spice and yeast while very light. mouthfeel was light and yeast, citrus and yeast peak on the way down. Very good! Drinkability is high on a nice summer day."
"Overall a stunning witbier, with only a slight lack in the mouthfeel and as a result the drinkability."
"Incredible! My tongue is rejoicing behind an indulgent smile. Gorgeous body, heavenly color. Marzapan basted in Orange Mango juice with a runover of fresh squeezed lemon. Jasmine lets the twins hang loose on a 'vanilla wafer' magic carpet ride. The skies are cloudy but the senses remain clear. Fly on brother, fly on!"
"By far one of the finest Belgian whites I've tasted, this one is a definite must for fans of this style of beer."
"D: Top notch from Allagash. Not as pungent or tastey as other but is still very refreshing and perfect for almost all seasons."
"These go down very easy - great version of the style. A favorite."
"One of the prettiest looking beers I have seen in a while but we all know looks aren't everything so I get to know the Allagash White a little more. A sweet perfume inspires me to go in for a little more, I go 90%, it goes 10 and the sweet, carbonated taste of a Belgian wheat hits me. Pretty good kisser too. Satisfying and light, an aftertaste that makes you want more. Gorgeous looks, subtle carbonation, and light sweets that hit the tongue are what it's all about. This beer is a keeper."
"D: One of my favorite Witbiers, very clean and crisp, perfect for summer."
"not thin, relatively smooth. refreshing and lively despite gentle carbonation."
"It's still a glorious offering, I would love to try it on tap!"
"bought a single. drank. red stripe broke one, then i bought another ... pineapple, honey light aromas... a simple refreshing refined brew ... a good example of the style ...smooth ... fresh ... enjoyable .. a hit with stu and melanie on the second go..."
"Poured a very uniform cloud with a nice 2 finger at 45F with fine lacing throughout. A very nice lemon zest nose dominates....The taste is truly very wide and very balanced...it just slakes on the tongue smoothly, but seems to lack a global mouthfeel. Drinkability is exceptional."
"Drinkable? I'd say so. Delicious witbier. Can't say I've had many better."
"This was quite drinkable. No particular element of it sticks out, but together it works, and makes a nice light summer beer."
"A nice light drinkable beer. Perfect for the summer."
"White with a bite!"
"Theres really no negative about this beer. The only thing I can think of is that the spices are pretty prominent as the main flavor, But its really the style, so thats just something I like sometimes. This is something I will drink very regularly, not everyday though, like I would a German weisse bier. Something I would like to serve to guests though. Overall really really good."
"Drinkability is great. This example of a wit might be slightly off the mark on style guidelines, but is dead on for a great lunchtime brew."
"D- Phenomenal and easy to drink. I could drink these all day at a barbeque. This is a witbier done right, not too sweet, not too spicy, flavorful and well balanced."
"Served in my Harpoon IPA glass. Poured a pale yellow-gold. Lots of tiny bubbles effervesced. Solution was a little cloudy, with particles of yeast detectable. One-inch foamy bright white head eventually settled into a thin skim of foam and tiny bubbles. Some strands of sticky lacing adhered to the side of the glass during the tasting. Scent of grapefruit, pale wheat and spice. Taste consistent with nose. Spices revealed as corriander and clove. Mouthfeel is light and lively without feeling watery. Nice, clean, mildly astringent finish. Light & refreshing without sacrificing flavor or character."
"Bottom line: A *great* Witbier that would make one hell of a return to beer in the upcoming summer. I wish we had it in Casper!!"
"Although I haven't had all that many witbieren, I can certainly say that this is a solid example of one - and it's not even Belgian!"
"And as I am finishing this review and the beer, it still has a slight film of the head left. Nice."
"Thanks very much to my girlfriend for bringing this back from the US for me."
"What a great summer beer! Color is a golden hazy yellow with a light head that stands for a while. The aroma is very honeyish and light orange, although my wife says she smelled some burgers grilling in it, too. Taste is fabulous: just enough fizz to satisfy the need on a hot night, and a bright feel that is quite refreshing. I tasted much less orange than I expected based on the smell, but was in no way disappointed. Ever so slightly bitter and very clean all around. Easy to drink and hits the spot in hot weather. Another great beer from Allagash."
"d: Not my favorite style, but this seems like a top notch take on it. I am enjoying this on a beautiful summer day and this seems like the perfect beer for the occasion. What Coors wishes Blue Moon tasted like."
"D : Real easy to drink witbier. Really enjoyed it."
"Crisp and spritzy in the mouth, with some real body from the yeast. Very refreshing, goes down about as easily as any beer I've ever had. Excellent warm-weather quencher. A true classic and one of the most Belgian-tasting American beers I've ever had not named Ommegang."
"Tasty and refreshing in a hot afternoon way, though not a best in style."
"Turn up the B vitamin, and get your cloud on!"
"D: This is a rather enjoyable beer... I can't rate any other aspect that high, but something about the beer makes it an easy drink for a summer day."
"D - Excellent all around beer, perfect for sessioning if not for the rather steep price."
"A fine looking beer: poured a off-yellow, sunny color, with a cloudy center. A small white head slowly fizzled down to lace around the egde of the glass. The smell was a flurry of flavor: yeast, spice, clove, banana, citrus fruit, wheat. Each time I stuck my nose in there, I got something different. The taste was equally wonderful, and even though there were plenty of flavors, it was perfectly balanced and not at all overwhelming. Up front, there was a grassy, wheaty flavor perfectly complimented by yeast. Then, as the beer went down, the rest of the flavors came through, especially the spices (particularly clove) and the citrus fruit (particularly orange). The beer left the mouth with a smooth, lightly bitter, crisp, refreshing taste. This was a pleasant beer to drink, a great American version of a Belgian classic."
"D: A tasty beer, but in the end didn't do it for me like some of the other wits that I have had."
"D- Smooth, light, refreshing, crisp. A great beer, and a great representative of this style."
"This is loyal to Belgian Brews, and can stands its ground next to Hoegaarten and Trappist whites...really! This is a bench mark of American micro brews. It is also very nice in the little four packs of bottles."
"This beer is a very cloudy yellow gold with a bright white head in the glass. The head is very sticky and is leaving a lot of lace. The smell is of zesty orange and lemon mixed with wheat and phenolic yeast maybe a tad weak though. The taste is of wheat and malty sweetness with tart orange and lemon providing bitterness with a bunch of spice coming along for the ride, coriander leads the way. In addition there is a good deal of yeasty flavor. Overall things tie together fairly well but the yeast flavor may be just a bit too dominant. The mouthfeel is crisp and light with a fair level of embedded carbonation it leaves a peppery bite in the aftertaste and finishes a touch dry, nice and lively and very refreshing. All together this is a good example of the style, the spicing isn't overdone which tends to be a flaw of many other wits, with a touch less yeastyness this would be very good."
"Overall well crafted beer with some good flavors-the yeast flavor was just not for me."
"Like most wheat beers, not much to look at. Thin head dies away quickly. Cloudy, pale yellow appearance. Aroma is very faint lemony citrus and cloves. Taste is wonderful and refreshing. Cloves and allspice, citrusy light hoppiness combine with sweet buttery toffee on finish. All the flavors are very subtle and alcohol is nearly undetectable. This would be a great beer to have on hand for those hot summer days."
"Emptied bottle into an oversized wine glass which produced small amount of head. Didn't notice any lacing. Nice look to this one, a bright lemony yellow color that was completely opaque. Flavors of clove, banana, and dry tea leaf spices. Easy drinking beer and I would like to sample many more of these. The thing that impressed me the most besides the taste was the awesome vibrant yellow color to it, very unique"
"D - Good beer, I recommend trying it at least once. My only problem with this beer is its price. It costs more than a 6-pack of normal witbier and you only get 4 bottles. If the price were competitive with other witbiers and it came in a 6-pack, it would be perfect."
"Smooth and tingly in the mouth; could drink a bunch all day long."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a tall and medium bodied white head that sticks around for a bit before settling. It laces the glass nicely on the way down as well. The smell is of very sweet malted wheat, strong hints of citris and coriander, and some other fruity perhaps banana flavors from the yeast. The taste is very good. It has a very strong sweet wheat base with the coriander, orange, and banana and clove flavors coming through to finish it off. The mouthfeel is very light and very refreshing which makes for a very drinkable wit. Definately worth a try if you like this kind of beer."
"My favorite from Allagash thus far, highly recommended."
"This is a nice light-bodied wit with great drinkability. My first wit, many years ago in Portland. I loved it them and was glad to re-visit it today."
"D- this is a beer you could put down with ease. A nice sixer of this and you would be set. This is a good summer brew to drink on a hot day."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, extremely crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is excellent. This is an extremely drinkable beer. Considering the warm weather we've had today, I couldn't ask for much better on a nice Spring evening. Very nice offering from Allagash."
"Pours murky yellowish white a light whitish head atop. Smell is very wheaty, more so than spicy to me with hints of citrus. Taste is equally wheaty, with a lesser spiced influence which I like about it. Hearty, flavorful and drinkable, and a style I'm perhaps coming around on, a bit because of examples like this. Good witbier."
"D - This is one of the finest (if not THE finest) American Witbiers you can buy. It is so well rounded in all aspects, and offers full flavor without beating you in the head with alcohol. The only limiting factor with this beer is it's pricetag at $8.99 for only a fourpack, but given it's quality, this can easily be overlooked."
"Best american witbeer i've tried."
"This is a beer I definitely enjoy most when its warm out, but its been a long winter and I missed it. Its a super easy drinking beer with a really memorable taste."
"Notes: Perfect for both the experienced and unexperienced beer-geek. This is a great Belgian-style American brew that can contend with the offerings from across the pond."
"Drinkability: An excellent thrist quencher or session beer."
"Best Wit I have had as of yet."
"D= Awesome example of a Belgian Wit. I will definitely be seeking out more of this!"
"Overall: delish"
"I could drink this all night. It's so drinkable it's insane. A great summer time brew with the citrus flavors. Highly recommended. If you like Blue Moon, this will blow your mind."
"Drinkability - A little heavy but otherwise great, you can drink this beer all night long without feeling like you drank bad beer, this is one of the best. I only prefer this type of beer on certain occasions but when I do it hits the spot."
"Has a light body with a tingling carbonation. Finishes clean and very easy to drink. I can drinking many of these on a warm summers eve. Low ABV makes drinkability high. Just wish it was more readily available in my local area."
"A light, pale yellow that has a good cloudiness with minimal head that maintained and left lacings. A spicy, peppery smell mixes with the yeast and some fruit tones (orange and lemon mostly) make a good smell. The taste is a mix of an extremely citric taste dominated by lemon and a very zesty spicey taste mixed in a full body. The wheat in this beer holds it all together for a very smooth mouthfeel while the lemon and some orange make it sweet on the tongue. The spices complement it on the sides and give it a good finish. A great beer that I could easily session."
"Came from the tap; it had a great, murky, light gold appearance with a thin head and a nice eventual lacing. Great lemon aromas with some wheat were sensed from this drink. It had a wicked sour-sweet dynamic going on, though they were not too powerful. It had a great, light-medium body/carbonation, allowing it be very refreshing. Overall, this one was wicked good."
"Allagash makes a textbook Wit here. It does not disappoint."
"D - Very smooth drinker. One of my favorites."
"Overall: Excellent witbier. Not over-the-top. Well-crafted."
"Had a pint of Allagash White last week at a local restaurant. The color was banana yellow, and this is one of the cloudiest beers you will ever have. The smell was of spice and lemon. As for taste, this is one of my favorite witbiers made in the US. I have not found one American brewer who has made a better version. The citrus and spice notes are present with every sip. Highly drinkable. A great session beer, or an excellent beer to have with a meal. This is my favorite Allagash brew."
"Drinkability- A real pleasure to drink. Sweet and light. I have to say it was a good thing they started bottling the beer in four packs now. It really suits quantity on this quality beer."
"Overall, being a huge witbier fan, I was a little disappointed. It reminded me more of a hefe, but tasty nonetheless."
"This is a very drinkable example of a witbier. Like most beers of this style, it's not heavy and goes down easy. Very refreshing."
"Pours a glorious golden yellow color. The smell is heavy with fruit. Mostly citrus, and has that hint of wheat. Very inviting indeed. The taste is of strong citrus fruitiness and has a slight wheat and banana flavoring. There's also a bit of spice present. Goes down extremely smooth. Highly drinkable."
"D- This is a wit that's perfect for social settings... delicious."
"I'm not normally a huge fan of witbiers, but this one is definitely an exception. A very cloudy orange color with a thin, white head and a slim to fair amount of lacing on the glass. Orange peels and coriander definitely make up the smell; the taste is so refreshing and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation that this would be a perfect session beer. Worth paying the extra money if you're a fan of the more moderately priced Blue Moon. Better than Hoergarrden (I know I spelled that wrong)."
"Drinkability- An extremely drinkable beer, light and complex, truly a great offering."
"By far the best witbier I can recall. This is a real testament to how strong of a style wits can be."
"D- Highly drinkable, a great beer from Allagash, goes well with BBQ or by itself."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable."
"In the tumbler, the beer is murky tan and yellow. A finger of creamy white head blankets the top. To the nose, it smells of creamed wheat, fresh lime and orange peel. The taste tends towards a husky graininess, with cool offsetting orange peel and coriander tones. Mouth-feel is simply stupendous. Outstandingly creamy and smooth. I nearly gulped the glass before I was half through the review. Could use a little more boldness of flavor in my opinion, but it's hugely drinkable."
"Pours a great banana and orange pale amber color with little head and invisible bubbles. The aroma is a little tart, but frut and clovey. Very inviting. The taste has a few hints of bananas, cloves, even granny smith apples. A little bit dry, but very quenching and addictive. Great for a summers day on the porch."
"D - Could do a couple on a nice hot day."
"A Yellower color than something like Hoegaarden White. Also more hop and bitterness than many wit beers. I liked this a lot and we had quite a bit of this to drink around the tasting table this night."
"M + D: Quite light, maybe a bit too light for my tastes. Carbonation is light in such a way that I can't help but think more of lemon flavoured sparkling water than a beer. That said, while seemingly light on the carbonation, it managed to feel a bit bloating, even after just a few sips. Not a very big fan... maybe a dash of bitterness or a touch more spiciness would help out, but not really one I'd go for again."
"Taste is spicy (surprising ... is that pepper?) citrus, bread, yeast, and lots of lemon. Looks, smells, and tastes good, but not mind blowing. Mouthfeel is a bit thin."
"Drinkability is great, as superb an example as you're going to get with an American witbier. Great balance of flavors and textures, very refreshing, perfect with a nice, peppery cheese."
"A very balanced and enjoyable offering. Went well with my meal at Whole Foods and would certainly pickup again. Would also be a nice session beer."
"drinkability is good. nice balance to this one. fairly interesting malt presence and well restrained spice. nice example of the style."
"Drinkability: Nothing objectionable... solid Witbier. Nothing to knock my socks off..."
"It pours out a beautiful, cloudy, lemony yellow with a nice but not persistent head. Aroma is strong, the typical hefeweissen aroma - wheaty, malty, with a lemony overtone. Flavor is rich and jazzy, what one expects of a wheat beer but richer and more mouth-filling and with a hint of hops. Smooth, crisp, refreshing, it has a touch of hop bitterness in the aftertaste."
"I don't think this is my favorite wit, but it is very balanced and quite good."
"This beer was poured into a tumbler. The beer pours the classic cloudy gold color of the witbier with a soft and fluffy white head that laces down the glass and leaves a nice film over the beer. The smell is full of what I always think of as the ""soft"" smell of unmalted wheat along with yeast and some citrus sweetness. The taste displays all of the characteristics of the smell but the coriander comes out nicely as well here. The mouthfeel is nice as well medium-full and soft carbonation. I am glad I finally got around to reviewing this one. This is my favorite wit. A great mix of refreshing and complexity. Just a fantastic brew."
"Drinkability: Wonderful stuff. This is one of the best American witbiers. The perfect drink for a hot summer day."
"A very good American representation of the style. Corked and caged 750mL poured into a hefeweizen glass. Pale, cloudy egg-yolk coloured yellowish/orange body. Fluffy, tightly knit white head looked like meringue and remained for several minutes. Nice. Smell was very wheat-like with a subtle lemon aroma hiding in the back. The whole thing seemed very light, which I found very attractive given the style. Taste was very light, as well, with modest nuances of yeast, wheat, lemon, and very subtle spice. Very drinkable and just a good example of a Witbier. I'll buy again."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Yep, no surprise here. Allagash White is the wit that all others should be measured by. It speaks volumes that the epitome of a Belgian style comes out of an American brewery. Well done, Allagash."
"For some reason, I had a really hard time finding this beer, but I was finally able to score a 12oz four-pack in a store quite a distance from my house that specializes in carrying rare beers... The search was definitely worth it... Pours a nice, golden color with some carbonation visible and a decent frothy head, although it wasn't as cloudy as I expected... The smell was terrific, full of spices, like corianer and orange... The taste was above and beyond, with a flavor of spices that was rich and flavorful... Mouthfeel and drinkability were equally good... This is truly a classic example of a witbier - up there with Blue Moon and Hoegaarden, if not superior... Definitely recommended, even though a four-pack ran me $8.99... The flavor is exceptionally rich and really stands out... go for it..."
"The beer is very light and goes down easily. Best enjoyed during the summer months in Maine, but can be enjoyed all-year round anywhere."
"Smell is pretty flat, taste is similar. Very drinkable, but not a lot of flavor here. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong. I guess you could call it subtle--not exactly what i expected but i could definately enjoy this again. Almost too drinkable--I needed a reason to slow down while drinking this."
"D - Highly drinkable! A damn near flawless witbier, it just needs to smell a bit more assertive and it would be awesome."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, but the sheer sweet factor keeps sessionability down. A nice breather on a hot day."
"This bottle was only six dollars and I felt like that is a good deal on a 750 of Belgian style ale. This is a really light yellow and almost white in my snifter with a puffy white head. The smell is spicy and not unlike most witbiers. The taste is very good, easy to drink, nice citrus flavors and some subtle spicy, peppery taste. This is one of the better wits I have had, I really like how subtle the flavor is and how easy to drink it is. There is some phenolic flavor but it does not detract from the beer."
"I'd gotten my hopes up for this one. A great session brew for a hot summer's day, but not living up to its rep. Definitely disc golf beer."
"O: Refreshing and enjoyable... among the better witbiers"
"Overall, a very enjoyable brew. Very drinkable and sessionable. Great with lighter food [e.g. fish]. Nice attempt at this Belgian style."
"drinkability improved as the beer mellowed out and continued to warm up, thouroughly enjoyed this refreshing beers and look foward to sampling their other offerings"
"An absolutely solid witbier, one of the best American examples of the style. Looks great sitting in a glass, pale cloudy/hazy yellow straw with a nice foamy white head. Nose is quite spicy with vague citrus. Taste is the usual coriander, wheat, and orange, but it's very well balanced. Mouthfeel is great, and drinkability is exceptional. While this beer may not seem to stand out, it really is a high quality, well-made, easy drinking beer."
"Pale, cloudy, lemon white body with a thick, yeast-flecked, cottony white head that sticks around for a long time. Classic witbier nose of bready wheat, yeast, lemon and orange citrus, and soft spices. Bready wheat malt flavors up front. Yeasty, with hints of fruit. Spices and orange zest fill in. Mildly tart, refreshing citrus splash near the wheaty finish. Moderate body with a refreshing, yet soft feel. A classic witbier, that is always great to see in keg form at your best friend's wedding reception!"
"Allagash White pours a hazy bright yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Coriander and citrus are both very noticeable in the aroma. Coriander plays a strong role in the flavor, there is also a strong citrus component as well. I would have to say that the flavor of the coriander is more prominent however. My personal preference would to have the citrus be more dominant, but in any case this is an excellent beer. Recommended."
"D - Not bad at all, I will have to give this one a second opinion. I expected it to be stronger than it was, but it is still a great brew. Were it just a bit heavier my opinion may have swayed further to the gold."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a chalice yielding a cloudy golden color. Subtle traces of spice linger during after taste. Very light on the nose. Yeast level in the pour plays a major role in the flavor. Would qualify as a nice session beer especially during the summer months. One of my favorite American witbiers for sure."
"White papery yellow color. Sharp lemon, cracker and whey aromas. A creamy, milky texture gives persistent, oily bitterness surrounded by lemon and orange peel. I walk away from it and try to define what keeps me from ""liking"" this beer. The bitterness is a little obnoxious, but not in an absolute sense; the bitterness seems unconnected to the other flavors (and way too persistent) and for that matter, so does the light, alcohol-derived sweetness. The finish is a bit of a chore too. It felt like it took forever to dispatch 12 ounces. None of the demerits are terribly obvious, but the bitterness builds, becoming more punishing as it drains."
"Bottle poured into a tumbler. Color was a hazy yellow. Head didnt last long at all. First thing that struck me was a strange ""celery"" / vegetable taste that was persistent the whole way through, which I didnt care for. Tried it cause it is compared to Hoegaarden often. I dont think I will be trying this again."
"Standard pint. Pours a very light straw color with a 2 finger head of stark white foam. The brew is cloudy, as expected, with a few stray bubbles in the brew, but it is generally calm. The aroma is dominated by coriander spice with a very nice creamy wheat base behind it. There is a more distant orange fruityness, but the spice is the main player here. Taking a sip, it brings what is expected from the flavors: lots of spicy coriander and lighter orange with a creamy wheat character. None of the flavors are too dominant, as they blend well into each other. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. It is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation in there to make it a little lighter. There is just a hint of herbal hop on the finish that just plays lightly at the sides of my tongue after swallowing the brew. This is the first brew I have put on my kegerator, and it really was a good choice, though I should have done a half barrel and not just a sixtel, as this one will not last too long. It is very flavorful and easy to drink. I am happy with it for sure!"
"Best American Wit, hands down."
"I really don't know what to think about this one. It was good, but I feel that it was missing something. I really think I should find a 750ml bottle, or try a bottle that is a little fresher. I will pass a final judgement after I find another bottle."
"Poured a nice looking lightish yellow-orange color with a good bit of white head on top. Opaque. Nose was surprisingly mild, but of your standard corriander, wheat, and citrus. Flavor was likewise. Body was fairly full-bodied for the style, which was nice. This one was very good, although not particularly unique. Oddly enough, it actually really reminded me of Blue Moon Wit, although not in a bad way."
"Would be a good session beer, but would get prciey after a while"
"Allagash White pours a cloudy yellow with a thick white head that lingers. Aroma is dry bready yeast with some sweet orange and a hint of corriander. The flavor is crisp and refreshing. It starts off with a sharp, almost sour flavor that gives way to a nice light wheat sweetness. The spices are apparent but not at the forefront, I like wits with more corriander, but I'd rather underspiced than overspiced."
"I've been eyeballing this one for awhile.The cost was the onlything holding me back,it was $9.00 for a 12oz 4 pack.The color seemed as if I poured a watered down pinnapple juice.Head lasted,wait no head, just a miniscule ring around the inside of the glass.Has a fruity kinda light bananna yeasty smell.Good feel in the mouth,carbonation sets this beer off ok.A fruity slightly spicy taste,a very light bodied beer.Not enough ""kick"" for me.This beverage is not too bad but i won't drink it all the time."
"[ serving type: on-tap ]"
"D: fantastic for drinkability but I must say I can be partial to witbiers during summers"
"Drinkability - The alcohol level is reasonable and makes this a beer which you can drink over an extended period of time especially in the summer months. This is my favorite summer beer presently even though I believe it is available throughout the year."
"Overall, Allagash Witbier Rocks! Great job on representing a German style brew. I had it with a turkey coleslaw melt and sweet potato fries. Enjoy"
"For my money this is the best witbier I've ever had and after about 5 years of drinking this beer it's probably one of my longest going favored beers. One of the first beers that sent me down the craft brew road."
"Final Statment: First off, let it be known that I am not a huge lover of Belgian styled beers. With that being said, this is the best I've had. This was a perfect marriage between complexity and drinkability. Beautiful beer, I need a bottle of this."
"25.4oz(750ml) bottle with cork and cage. Beautiful label and very classy(classic) packaging. Beer pours a pale hazed yellow with a soapy head and great lace. Aroma of belgian yeast clove spiciness. Peppery hops, lemon and coriander round out the nose. Taste of sweet lemon, coriander which translates into a mild blueberry fruitiness, as well as clove and pepper flavors. Very balanced, superb flavors that blend and compliment. As for food pairings, Allagash White seemed made for the grilled swordfish and the first local corn on the cob of the season I enjoyed it with."
"Beef Notes: Without a doubt my favorite witbier. Nothing else can touch it, as far as I'm concerned. Sadly, I don't see it in stores as much as I used to."
"Drinkability: Its fine, but not a beer I can really get excited over. Not that I don't sincerely try to be that Excited About Wits Guy, but I'm starting to feel as though that's never going to be the case."
"Having recently tried this for the first time on tap, I had the opportunity to try out a bottle and found similar satisfaction. A light cloudy yellow brew with a thin but steady head and a vague lacing. It has a light bready smell and on this night it seems a couple of us trying this out detected a barbeque aroma which I thought blended tastefully with a doughie quality. The flavor is light and lemony with a great blend of bread and a pleasant peppery spice. It is lightly carbonated and easy drinking. This is fast making my summer hit parade!"
"have been eyeing this beer for awhile but the price has kept me away to this point, regardless, i broke down tonight and am glad i did . although i had my ""white "" out of a bottle my friend had his in a pint glass. Light in color, like a pale straw, nice head that broke quickly and retained a light lace. the most distinctive attribute that i picked up with this very drinkable and refreshing brew was a very distinctive taste of barbeque sauce, more on the start than on the finish but none the less unmistakable throughout. would definitely return to this again although i see more whites in my future to compare this to."
"DA: highly."
"Would drink this one again, but not at the top of my list. Pours a cloudly, light caramel/gold color. Large white head that dissipates slowly, leaving a small white head which stays throughout the beer. Nice amount of lacing. Aroma has a strong lemony scent. There was a bit too much carbonation, but overall a nice mouthfeel even though the carbonation gave it a bit of a bite. There was a citrus taste, a nice orange taste throughout. There was a bit of a lemon finish. Pretty good control of the taste, a nice mixture with the spices and all."
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is high leaving the mouth refreshed and ready for another gulp. I could drink this all night long if I could. Definately will purchase this again. Highly recomended."
"Drinkability: This is not quite as light as most wit beers thanks to the residual sweetness, but still decently quaffable."
"Tasty. I'm going to go finish this out on the porch."
"Overall, it's a nice mellow and pleasant summer Beer. I like it for what it is, but don't anticipate an extreme Beer with powerful flavour, cuz it's a bit muted."
"Allagash has continued to impress. This is a delicious beer."
"Mouthfeel is a hair thin. Drinkability is very good. Would be a nice summer beer for mass quantities consumption. Not an outstanding representative of this style, but a solid beer."
"Pours a hazy blond color with minimal carbonation. Nice aroma of spices with a strong wheat aroma. Taste is somewhat strong at first with a spicy finish and hints of orange peel in between. Not strong, not weak. Seems pretty well balanced to me. A decent example of the style."
"drinkability - Nice summer beer, clean and refreshing for a hot day. Enjoyed this one, would buy again."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light cloudy yellow with nice lacing, but head does not last long. Nice wheaty aroma, if a bit light. Taste is light and lemony - too light. I've always been a big hefeweizen fan and have recently been trying some Belgian witbiers, and generally being a bit disappointed in their lightness. I've been doing some reading and am learning that the lightness generally goes along with the style - along with spices, but not much spice was noticeable in this one. Personally, I'd take a decent hefeweizen over this one any day."
"Overall, a good witbier. It doesn't have the biggest flavor, but that's part of the appeal. An absolute joy to drink standing outside with friends next to the grill. Few other beers say ""summer"" like Allagash White."
"Saw in on tap for the first time in Charlotte, and at $3.50 a pint, not a bad price. Pours a much darker than typical witbier. Nice fruit and citrus notes to the smell, quite refreshing and easy to drink. Not too much spice. Some haziness and little head. Nice on a summer evening, but nothing to rave about."
"and thank god they did not put the requisite slice of orange or lemon on the rim, the map room did not do this with any of the various wheat beers our party was served. hallefuckenlujah as i forgot to tell them no garnish. this was also quite tasty, maybe even more so, enjoyed in solitude via bottle."
"Drinkability: summer is almost here and i cannot wait to enjoy summer beers like this one out in the sun."
"Pretty drinkable"
"Again, perhaps this was an off batch or had been on the gas too long. I'll give it another try as previous versions have been vastly superior to what I tried last night. What I had last night was disappointing."
"It seems so very neutral which I figure is what makes this beer so very drinkable."
"Recommended"
"Very nice brew, just had to add that first. Poured a very light pale yellow, very hazy. No real head or lace, nice carbonation. The smell was very fruity, almost sour. Hints of bread, grain and spice with a really nice pear, fig behind it. Very lively aroma. The feel was splended. Very smooth, crisp, and clean. No real aftertaste and I have to knock it back a bt for feeling a tad light, but the flavors were very nice. Lots of fruity tones, with hints of spices. Slight bit of a dry hoppiness and citrus bite, but I stress this as slight. Overall this was a totally sessionable belgian beer and an awesome hot day summer brew!"
"This is a wonderful beer."
"D- the taste and mouthfeel leave you craving more. very drinkable. easy to enjoy."
"D: Quaffable session brew. For the price, it may be the best domestic Witbier available, however I prefer the Belgian versions with more yeast characteristics. That said, the showcasing of noble hops in this beer is amazing."
"Pours a golden color. Aggressive decanting still leaves some yeast in bottom of bottle. Aroma is lemons, peppery spices, and yeast. Taste is dominantly banana with some orange, lemon, and bready yeast. Mouthfeel is on the light side, which I enjoy. Slightly bitter finish is rather unpleasant. Fine beer, but slightly overrated, IMO."
"D: Perfectly refreshing and drinkable. Wonderful flavor & mouthfeel, its only flaw was the aroma. I would love to have this one again. Many thanks to IntriqKen for sending via trade..."
"Pours an opaque yellow color into my DT tulip glass. Produces a nice, creamy looking head which eventually dissipates and leaves a nice foamy build-up along the edges of the the glass with some lace. A very pretty beer; cloudy in the tradition of the style. The aroma is delightful. Lemon and orange scents with sweet malt and a hint of spice. What spice? Admittedly, I cannot tell. Coriander, maybe, but that's only because I would expect it here, not because I can actually tell. Is curacao a spice? Taste is crisp and clean. Again, lemony with other citrus notes. Sweet and fruity up front with a vaguely peppery finish. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic example of the style. Allagash has done this one right."
"Bottle came to me from mikegroove in my B'day 07 box."
"Pours a very pale straw color that is very cloudy. There is a delicate white head that was short, and short lived. The smell is immediate yeast, with spice in the back ground. The taste is divine. extremely palatable ans smooth. There is some yeast flavor and when the beer is agitated in the mouth spice can be detected. Nothing is overpowering but they blend well to make a flavorful, crisp, wonderful taste. Very drinkable beer."
"like all of the allagash beers i have had this beer is very true to style and the flavors and aromas are very soft but present."
"This is an excellent example of the style. I used to enjoy Celis White when I was in Texas, and had friends working at the brewery. This is as good as Hoegarden I've had here in the US, maybe as good as I've had in Brussels."
"This poured a very hazy pale yellow/white with minimal carbonation and a thin head and some quality retention. Thick, murky yeast at the top. The smell is of grains and wheat with a light bitterness and smooth fruitiness. The outstanding taste is highlighted by the mild fruity citrus of limons mixed with the smooth wheat and a fantastic sweet and sour finish. Light and crisp in the mouth that leaves you wanting more and more."
"D- It is very good for the style. I am not a huge fan of this style but off the top of my head this is the best one of them. Just very well balanced and seems very traditional to the style."
"Drinkability - I cannot wait for the summer and throw a few steaks on the BBQ and savor a few of these. This will be on my list of beers for the coming dog-days of summer. Very well done for the style. Pass me another."
"D: I'm pretty disappointed with this brew, I've had others that are a lot more flavor. I can't believe this is the third best witbeir on BA-give me a Holy Moses anyday over thi. For the price, I won't be coming back."
"Certainly this is a pleasant Belgian white but not quite what I was hoping for. Worth trying but better witbiers exist."
"Listless flavor overall. Some spice and orange, needs a bit of cheese to really bring out the taste. Mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth. Fairly simple with no aftertaste. Hard to tell if I'm drinking a wine or a beer. Can't say that I would have this again."
"Pours a clowdy yellowish-gold. Nice, crisp head with very clingy lace which grabs on until the beer is done. The spices and citrus-like notes of this beer are in perfect harmony. One of my favorite examples of the style."
"Pours with a cloudy, flaxen appearance and a nice head, in the spirit of a classic white. Smell has hints of cloves, banana, and lots of sweetness. Definitely on the sweeter end of the scale for a white. The cloves and banana are also present in the flavor, but are certainly not overpowering. Very nice."
"Drinkability: Ahh, sessionable. Very easy to drink, it is the kind of beer you start drinking and you dont quite realize that youve finished it in a few minutes. 5/5"
"Solid!"
"[this is Batch #33]"
"I'll admit, I'm not a huge fan of witbiers. I had this one on draft tonight at Flying Saucer and had to put my two cents in. Poured a hazy dark yellow almost orange color with almost no head which quickly diminished to a ring leaving no lacing on the glass. Smell was mildly spicy with some fruit aspects I would expect from a witbier. Taste, I must say, was rather good. Certainly one of the best I've had of the style. Low alcohol with moderate carbonation gave this a rather summery beer feel to it. I'll likely give this another try when summer rolls around."
"Drinkability: It goes down very smooth and easy, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Again, not too heavy at all, very light but has bold, solid flavors."
"Drinkability is great with the modest ABV and ease with which it goes down."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle with a batch number (#29) but date (checked website but no batch references) into my large mug so I could get all the yeast. Had a really amazing cloudy yellow color that reminded me of beaten egg yolk. Had a good head that settled down into a constant film. The aroma was perfect - very spicy with a malt backbone. I was however a little disappointed with the taste. It was good but not great as I hoped based on the smell and some other reviews. I did buy it in Indy and shipped here so maybe it lost something and not sure how fresh so want to try again. For other reviews this sounded like it could be a 5 rating for me but just 4 for now. Also didn't like the mouthfeel as it had way too much carb that kept attacking my tongue. Overall still recommend but hoping my next sample will improve the scores (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Drinkability: I was really hoping that this beer was going to better than this because I read some good things about the Witbier. It's really disappointing because I paid $2 for this bottle and it turned out to be only worth $.20 a bottle. It's a good thing I only bought a single and not a 4 pack. I gave it a 3.5 because it is somewhat refreshing and smooth during the hot summer months. Would I give this beer another try? Not for a long time."
"Pours a hazy white head with a hint of yellow and some lacing. Swirling the bottle was essential to get the real mouth feel that this beer has to offer. Nice hints of coriander, citrus flavors, yeasts, and spices. A very good Witber, worthy of its reputation as a classic."
"12oz. bottle poured a cloudy yellow with a small white head and leaves a bit of lace around the glass. Smells a little sweet with a orange and yeast aroma. Taste some sweet fruit flavors with a bit of a wheat grain flavor. The feel is light and crisp with a touch of carbonation. An easy to drink witbier but I more of a fan of the big robust stouts and will probably try this one again in the warmer summer months."
"This is a wonder of brewing tastiness on a hot summer day, but I turned to it on a whim on a cold fall evening. I paired it with pan-seared tuna and tuna tartare, along with wasabi potatoes, and I'll tell you, it was a willing and fine companion. They go down smooth, refreshing, and swimmingly. One begets the urge for another, and time willing, they're worth however many you drink. My wife had one as well, and according to her, she has a new go-to beer. I'd better get to the store, and the sooner the better."
"The subtle, complex flavors and excellent mouthfeel render this a highly drinkable brew."
"I got this pint at Malones Restauraunt In Old Boston (Lexington, Va.) It had a nice cloudy lemon cloror to it. The head was very fluffy and I got about one and a half fingers. The lacing on the other hand was rather thin. The retention was also fast. There were hints of fruit in the aroma and the taste proved to be very hoppy. The mouthfeel was kind of rigid, but all in all it was a very decent brew."
"Drinks okay, wits aren't my favorite style & this just middle of the pack as far as I can see"
"The mouth is surprisingly sturdy. This is a great easy drinker that went well with the salmon, quiche, and pizzas that were served. Well done!"
"Taste is even more impressive, and though it feels light and springy, not watery in the least, which goes nicely with the solid wheat malt tones that support the rest. Citric lemon and orange rind even, but also very nice corriander, everything in balance, weighed just right. Very nice. Does Wisconsin get htis one? I hope so."
"Overall: A nice drinkable witbier, not my favorite, but solid."
"The mouth is light and vibrant, offerring some solid complexity. It is extremely drinkable. Good stuff."
"Had this on tap a while back, now had it in a bottle. Looks a lot better out of the bottle, hazy yellow gold, with a nice luxurious looking head, great lacing. I get lots of stuff in the nose, licorice, anise, pepper, coriander, yeqast, maple syrup. The taste is a little more straightforward, mostly malt sweetness, wheat, a little spice. Has a good mouthfeel, highly carbonted which works here makign this fairly refreshing."
"this beer is insanely drinkable.... I went throgh the large corked and caged bottle to fast for my own good. Very tasty and refreshing stuff!! Recommended!"
"A golden pale yellow with a light lacing. A very wheat smell with a hint of sweet fruit. It has a sweet yeast and grain flavor but a surprisingly little amount of wheatiness. This makes the beer seem far more balanced then other wheat beers. The beer has a crisp carbonation and a smooth clean feel. In all I would say this is a fine white and worth a try."
"Fluffy mouthfeel, sweet orange with a hint of gapefruit, fennel seed, and of course the characteristic wheat flavor. Body is rather watery and taste is relatively unlively. Nothing about this beer jumps out at me, I have had much better beers of this style and much better from Allagash. Still a better than average brew, very refreshing and drinkable."
"Doesn't really matter, this is a tasty beer that I'd be happy to have again, though I think next time I'll get it in the summer."
"A pale yellow color with a lemon smell and taste of the top. It was very smooth with a taste of barely and and a hint of lemon and orange. It went down very smooth. Not much head on it. Highly recommend it."
"Pale yellow in color. Almost zero head that completely disappeared. Clove, allspice, some banana. Expected a little more aroma. Like many Allagash brews, this one was quite carbonated. Not like the 10th Anniversary, though. Although I like most Allagash beers, I wouldn't lug these back in my luggage."
"This is an amazing beer from a style I'm not very familiar with. I would definitely work this into my rotation of my normal doppelbocks. Yay variety!"
"Pours a cloudy light orange/yellow with a medium white foamy head. The smell is full of wheat,cloves,banana, and lemon. The taste has coriander,clove,pepper,banana,bread yeast, and lemon zest. A sublte flavor that is very good. The m/f is light with the many flavors mixing masterfully. An excellant beer from one of the top breweries in America."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat creamy yet quite thin, and the carbonation seemed to be a bit overdone."
"D - Drinkable. This is a nice brew and my first Allagash at that, will definitely buy some more and others from this brewery."
"2011 draft sample: A bit soapy, thin bodied. Mild earthy coriander and earthy spice, quenching. Today I don't hold it in high regard as I used to."
"Goes good with lemon or without."
"I really enjoyed this. I recommend it to anyone."
"(Batch 27, picked up at the brewery)"
"With all my nitpicking about the palate and mouthfeel I cant knock this beer at all when it comes to drinkability! Wow, I bet I could kill a six-pack without thinking. Id love to try this beer on-tap. I want to drink this beer with brunch. I bitched a lot but I sure did enjoy my sample. Thank you hoffman!"
"Golden colour with a bit of haze and a rocky white head. Thick, clumpy lacing and good head retention. Citrusy aroma with notes of cloves, spicy hops, sweet malt, and lemon zest. Lemony flavour with a floral hop middle. Spices hit towards the end, along with a dry bitterness. Lightish body with moderate carbonation. Not bad at all and quite enjoyable on a holiday afternoon. I now expect this kind of quality whenever I try a new beer from Allagash and I haven't been disappointed yet."
"D- mellow refreshing brew, well brewed, stands out from other wit's I've had, i'd grab this one again."
"This is a flavorful beer, but the flavors just don't seem to mix well. Needs something to balance them out. Overall a decent beer, but I don't know if I'll try this one again."
"It's a very nice light beer. It's great with anything, and most of all it's refreshing. It's the perfect beer with any meal. This beer is very clean and crisp. Definitely add a lemon while drinking this beer."
"Appearance is a very light cloudy yellow color similar to that of a lemonade. Head is white and creamy about 1/4"" remains throughout the session. Smells of sweet fruit, bananas with some coriander or orange peels. Taste is sweet with somewhat of a peppery finish with an orange like taste being the most dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Drinkability is pretty high as alcohol is light but this is an easy drinking great summer beer."
"D: Very drinkable, this style is great during the summer and this particular beer does not disappoint."
"I made a note to finish off the yeast in every bottle as the directions read on the side, which is apparently a Belgian tradition of spreading the wealth or the yeast, which I found to be mild and dry. This was a great find."
"Very drinkable beer. One of the better witbiers I've had."
"Pours a hazy yellow, small white head, lots of lace and retention, great rings on the glass. Smell is sweet, citrus, vanilla, spices, yeast, a little banana, smells like a witbier. Taste is malty, some wheat, spices, citrus, vanilla, yeast and a little banana again. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, very enjoyable witbier."
"A great example of the style and sure thing at the next barbeque."
"I'd like to try this in a flight with other wheat beers. I am quite sure that it would place high on any comparison."
"Very drinkable. Wished I had popped this open during the really hot weather, but even so, there is a lot to like here."
"Great mix here with the lemon and orange taking center stage. Some cloves and grassiness bringing up the rear. Clean and easy drinking. This one had just enough carbonation to make it go down smooth and easy. Great to accompany a mix of fresh seafood."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with some yeast sediments floating around. Pour produces a nice creamy white head that leaves a lot of lacing around the glass. Aroma is spicey with orange peel, yeast and lemon. Taste is sensational. It's smooth and crisp flavors are perfect for the hot summer months. Delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is spritzy, sugary, with candy smoothness that starts at the front of the tongue and has nice balance."
"A good rendition of a Wit, all about balance and ease of drinking. I'm sure I'll return to it again."
"The taste is smooth, but citrus tangy, with the yeast in full regal form. The flavours balance to make one smooth, fantastic brew. The spice lingers on the palate."
"All in all a good beer - not outstanding, but definitely drinkable, and certainly impressive for a wit brewed stateside."
"Comments: This is a superb example of a Belgian white wheat beer. Fabulous. Very flavorful with spicy overtones while remaining light & crisp. Highly recommend...."
"This is an odd beer, no doubt about it. While refreshing and not bad tasting, Im not sure spicy celery is a flavor I want in my beer, but this one has it in spades. Overall, quite a clean and refreshing beer, but not one Id buy on a regular basis."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Allagash White is a nice example of a Belgian Wit. Plenty of spiciness with overtones of banana, clove and lemon. Crisp with a dry, subtle hoppiness definitely makes me want to take another swallow. Super refreshing and very easy to drink. A summer thirst quencher for sure."
"Try this beer!"
"The mouthfeel was spicy, fizzy, prickly but in the best possible way. Charming, to use a goofy term, because it was all fizz at first, but then rounded out nicely as I drank on."
"This is a great witbier... spicy and flavorful but goes down easy and oh so refreshing. This beer just kept getting better as I drank my way through it. The flavors just opened up just enough to be in control and balanced. Allagash sets a standard for US crafted belgian brews IMO and they have once again done it here."
"I'm not sure I would drink a bunch of these at once, but for those hot summer days this would be perfect. Drinkability would be a bit higher if I was more of a fan of this style."
"Poured into a pint glass, the beer is gold and cloudy with a thin head that seems to carry a yeast residue which remains on the surface after the head has disappaited. There is a pronounced, sweet wheat smell from the beginning. Taste follows smell as it has a sweet wheat and yeast taste to it, with fruit and light spices. Cinnemon seems to in among it. A very good beer for this style. The sweetness is unlike other wheat styles that I've had. I highly recommend this beer."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly no lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Yeasty nose. Starts with more yeast than anything, looking for spices - they are subtle, quiet finish needs more crispness. $1.70 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Had to review this beer based on recent inconcistencies I have found. In the past year, I've had this beer on tap around 3-4 times, and each time it is completely different. One time it was thin, somewhat watery and a bit bitter, another time it tasted like it wasn't finished fermenting - sweet, cloying, and fresh wort flavors dominating. Lately everthing else is up to par, but just tastes way overspiced with coriander. If I can taste coriander, its probably too much, and at this point its getting into the Blue Moon range of spiciness - not good. Overwhelming coriander in the nose and on the palate really decreases the drinkability."
"D- A shame I had to leave with only one drink. A great beer on tap in Allagash's backyard!"
" Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable experience. I would drink this again."
"Cloudy off-white appearance, 1/2 inch head with nice retention. Aroma is fairly sour, with hints of lemon and orange spice. The flavor is earthy and dry, with less of the citrus than noted in the aroma. Somewhat yeasty and sour with virtually no sweetness, it has light spice and peppermint in the finish. Alcohol is not evident. Great mouthfeel, light but with a creamy, bubbly character. The drinkablility is excellent on this one, not too strong, a good mix of flavors. A fine Witbier..."
"D- This beer was bright fruity and crisp but it could use a bit more depth in flavor if I was to drink more than one a sitting."
"A medium-full taste. Mostly lemongrass, citrus, and yeast. Nice finish, crisp and clean. I drank this one fairly quick as the lighter beers tend to feel like water. However, this had flavor that was rather enjoyable."
"Found this at Lou's in Augusta for $8.99, hell why not, new to me. Pours very hazy yellow, can't see through. Smells sweet and a bit yeasty. Tastes quite fizzy, a bit if citrus peel, slight yeasty flavor, and a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit more fuzzy than I normally like. Overall it's pretty good, not a style I normally partake of but it's good. If you have macro friends who are slightly intersted in micros it's a great intro beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Light and prickly in the beginning, it swells in such a smooth, easy way... emphasizing the spices and wheat character. Light but very distinctive and totally appropriate. What a great witbier, the best U.S. take on the style."
"Drank at USBTC Tasting, Jungle Jim's, Cincinnati. The beer does everything that you want a Witbier to do, and then some. It has the typical soft citrus, spicy, belgian, wheat characer. Has light yellow glitter color with a mild haze. Looks cotton-ey. Smells a little more wheat-ey and estery than most Wits; more Hefe-like. Tastes more than typically Belgin with extra souring, twangy, and yeasty. Alcohols seem heavier than normal and give a lightly phenolic and soapy character. Despite the mild off-flavors, the extra boldness is attractive. Still light and fresh feeling to the mouth. Finishes mostly clean and soft. Very nice."
"Overall a very good beer. Definitly a nice after dinner selection to refresh the palate. Almost could act as a sorbet between courses."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Drinkability - goes down very easy and is good. Could go for more in a session."
"Edit: Something about this beer reminds me of Froot Loops, and I mean that in the best possible way."
"This is a very good beer, especially if youre looking for something light and smooth. Its an excellent representation of the style."
"Pours a bubbly, dull yellow with a carbonated film head. Smells sticky and sweet, and does remind me of Hoegaarden in aroma. Distinct wheat scent, no distinct hop aromas. Taste is very sweet, all wheat, slightly citrusy. Hops are muted with barely discernible, slightly bittering traces in the finish. Not much detected as for spices--the sweetness dominates. This beer sticks to style. Mouthfeel is heavy as expected, low on carbonation, and just right all around, though if I were being picky, I imagine it could be a little fuller, thicker, and heavier without approaching 'syrupy.' Given the style, to me this is slightly more drinkable than Hoegaarden, which I dislike (I realize this is heresy to some). Yes, a purist I am not--I personally prefer the flavor of SA White Ale over this. This is fine in it's own right, of course, just not one I will crave. And if you are a purist and like true-to Belgian style, than why aren't you drinking a Hoegaarden?..."
"Great wheat/grainy blast upfront. Lemon finish. Sweet malts. Very good beer."
"A perfect summer brew. Another winner from this stellar brewery."
"I prefer this over the classic of this style- Hoegaarden - because it is more refreshing while retaining a delicious citrusy, spicy flavor."
"The freshest bottle I could find. Cloudy yellow/orange in color with a large and thick head of foam. Exotic aromas of mango and apricots along with a touch of coriander. A very light example of the style. Southampton Double White really spoiled me because I havent had a white beer that satisfied my desires ever since. Its a shame really. This example is fairly simplistic with notes of green apples, passion fruits and coriander combined with a fairly rich and creamy palate."
"Doesn't smell like much, but a very nice witbier. Great head, nice retention. Mouthfeel is light and wheaty, with big lemon splash. Not many hops to speak of, in the tradition of the great belgian style. Goes down smooth. You can drink 50 of these in one sitting!!!"
"Tasty goods, good looks and masterful drinkability. Looks are hard to beat too."
"Cloudy yellow in color with a moderate level of carbonation bubbles flowing to the sustain a thin film. Scattered trails of thin lacing. Smell of lemon, melon, yeast and some pepper. Taste is very mild, light malts with a peppery finish. Lively mouthfeel. A nice witbier and one I would certainly consider as very indicitive of the style. No flaws but nothing earthshattering either, just a solid beer."
"Try it if you can get it."
"D: This would perhaps make a good summer session beer, but there's no reason for me to seek this again. I'll have a Hoegaarden next time."
"Good drinks. I'll buy more of this when it gets hot."
"Poured a cloudy lemon with a minimal head and lace into a pint glass. A good bit of carbonation. Mouthfeel isn't harsh, but isn't smooth either."
"Overall = Really delicious Witbier. One of the better I've tried. Highly recommended for fans of the style."
"Pours golden and cloudy with a thick white head that disapates quickly. Very smooth with hints of floral, and citrus.There almost is a whiff of baby powder in this beer if thats possible This is a great summer witte! This will be a regular in my fridge."
"Beer poured a semi-cloudy straw yellow with little head and no residual lacing. Could be that i picked up some older bottles. The yeast is suspended so it makes for an interesting view. Nose is wheaty, grassy, and has some hints of spice, perhaps coriander. Taste is a nice complex mix of the items picked up in the nose with a fine light crisp hop finish. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated for a nice lively feel. Drinkability is awesome. This would make a fine tailgaiting beer!"
"i'm not a huge witbier guy, but i guess this is par. my girlfriend likes it. it grows on me a little, as i drink it"
"Poured a hazy yellow with no head and excellent lacing. The aroma was citrus and sweet fruits, with some honey and mild spice. The taste was much of the same, orange was very dominant, clove and vanilla followed and alcohol finished things out. The feel was rather bitter at first, some sweet and sourness whihc ended up being a smooth finish. A great example of a white."
"Bad: I wish the smell was a bit more pronounced but I may just be picky here."
"mouthfeel is buttery and creamy. nice. pretty drinkable as witbiers go. would be refreshing on a hot day."
"To me, this is one of the better Belgian-style American beers out there. It's also my favorite American witbier of the ones I've had. Excellent beer."
"D - I don't think I'm going to repeat this one."
"Pours an almost neon pale straw color with a finger of snow white bubbles. Nose is balanced between musty yeast and spice and sweet tropical fruits. Taste is equally balanced as well. starting of with a dry musty yeastiness, peppery spice, then turning mildly sweet with notes of pineapple and apricot. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. This is a nice and balanced wit. Most wits are either heavy on the clove or heavy on the sweet fruit, and this one strikes a nice balance between the two."
"Just like the scent the flavor has a nice kick of spice. Pepper and corriander up front with a wheaty orange zest undertone. Feel is sharp and acidic, though smooth and silky. My first taste of Allagash, and no doubt not my last."
"This beer pours a pale wheat color with a thick, white foamy head. When held up to light this brew is nice and cloudy, hmmm tasty looking, The aroma of this beer is great. The nose has a nice citris smell combined with plenty of spices. The first sip is primarily spicy with subtle orange flavor. Very smooth and refreshing. The mouthfeel is full due do the high level of carbonation, it's a party for the tastebuds. The finish is dry, without being overly bitter. Drinkability?....very high. This is a tasty brew that goes down easy and at 5.5% this is made for session duty on a hot day!"
"Great job with the Belgian style here. I could definitely suck down many of these, especially on a hot summer day."
"The taste is great - very light and crisp. Lemon and honey come through, with a faint hay aftertaste. I enjoy this beer, and think its probably the best in its category."
" I usually don't like beers this light..but this one is so good - looking.!!... and although the taste is mild; it's a really nice taste....it's growing on me as I drink it. Would go very well with food."
"Everytime i order this beer they refer to it 'like hoegarden,' but I definitely has a taste and presentation all its own. Presented in Allagash white glass with lemon. Great foamy head with a strong lemon/citrus zing. A little bitter on the aftertaste, but overall it is very smooth. Lightly carbonated and easy drinkability make this a very refereshing beer."
"This would be a spring/summer favorite, if it were available on a wider scale in the mid-west. Ill keep my eye out for it in the future. A very refreshing brew, and a good candidate for the session status."
" Allagash has a unique, unbelievably refreshing taste that I don't think can be topped in its class. My hats off to Allagash."
"This beer poured a hazy, light golden color with a bit of white head. There is a nice citrusy aroma of orranges, corriander, lemon that is pleasing to the nose. The taste is a nice low carbonated, citrus fest for the mouth. This is a refreshing beer with a bit of bitterness that rounds out this white beer. Very drinkable."
"Chalky straw with a nice foamy head. Lovely apricot-pepper-lemon zest nose. Taste too is peppery and loaded with citrus and coriander. Very refreshing. Solid underlying malt backbone and subtle bitterness. Spicy and thirst quenching at the same time. Very complex for the style."
"This beer came a foggy yellow with apricot highlights and a thin white head that had a big bald spot in the middle. Smells of spicy fruits with coriander and oranges and a chalky marshmallow base. Tastes super fruity with dates, melons and lemons with a fine nutty and banana yeast. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. This is a nice and easy drinking beer that has a smooth combination of flavors."
"This is a very good every day beer. It is a cloudy yellow appearance, with a small head that retains well. I think it has a predominately spicy odor, with some fruitiness also. It tastes spicy (coriander) and fruity (lemon). Good mouthfeel, not too carbonated, and quite smooth. A person could sit down and drink a few of these."
"Great. I'd buy it again. This would be something I'd trade out for my brother's Rolling Rock. I like RR because it's light, but this has real flavor, maybe I'll get him to dig this too."
"A refreshing and well-balanced wit. The spices are definitely noticeable, but not over the top and lend an interesting character."
"Drinkability- I'm hoping really hard that this bottle is past it's prime. Just not a good beer in this case. If it had some carbonation and some life to it, we may be talking a different story. Every Allagash brew I have had to date was above average, so I will try this again at a later date and re-review if necessary."
"My first Allagash beer...poured into a large red wine glass with a cloudy orangish yellow color and near perfect head retention. Smell was spicy and buttery with a definite presence of orange peel and some other light fruits. Taste was hoppy and sweet, with all of the fruit characters making themselves known. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, hoppy and incredibly balanced. What really stuck out for me with this beer was how refreshing it was. The alcohol presence is also a plus, given that it is barely noticeable, making it quite easy to drink. This is a stellar belgian style beer that I haven't really had too much experience with in the past, but will certainly be having mroe of in the future. Three cheers for Allagash"
"Great drinkability. I'll be having this again - hopefully in a 750ml bottle."
" I'm still getting used to the witbier style and taste. Hoegaarden was always one of my favorites and one of the beers that got me going away from the mass-market swills that I used to consume. The Allagash White has furthered my interest in this style, and I look forward to sampling more witbiers in the future. Very enjoyable and worth sampling!"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Love the Wit's and Allagash brews a good bunch of them."
"Bright yellow in colour and somewhat hazy. Strong carbonation. Strong lemon aromas, with more subtle hints of grapefruit and black pepper. The coriander comes through much stronger in the mouth, and theres even a bit of grassy hop flavor in there too... along with your typical citrus/banana/bubble gum wit flavors. A bit more bitter and grassy than I would like, and the body is a touch watery, but this is still a solid wit."
"After drinking and enjoying the hell out of Allagash Grand Cru, I knew they were capable of great things. Even so, I wasn't prepared for the magnificence of Allagash White. It delivers on every item from my 'witbier wishlist', combines them into one amazing package and ties it all up with a perfect ribbon of drinkability. Allagash is rapidly ascending the list of my favorite U.S. craft breweries."
"The beer pours a light golden hue. It is cloudy with bits of sediment and a medium sized white head. The aroma is very refreshing, quite citrusy with hint of spices. The taste is very crisp and refreshing with complex lemony citrus flavors along with hints of spices and a subtle hop finish. The beer is very drinkable and would probably be more enjoyed on a warm summer day. Very good beer."
"Very balance and smooth, I put the entire bottle down quiker than I wanted, it was very good."
"I recently came back to this delicious brew, having been away from it for about a year. It pours golden/yellow with some haze and a medium sized head. It's a light-style Wit, not packing a huge punch...but a huge punch isn't needed when enjoying this beer. Smells a little ""airy"" and I'm still trying to come up with just which spices are included as the label states it has some. Coriander, I think. Completely drinkable, in fact should come in a 12 pack so I wouldn't have to make another trip to the store. Ah well, off to pick up more..."
"This is an alright brew, but it leaves me wanting something with more flavor."
"Drinkability; this would be a great refreshing summer beer. If I could routinely obtain it, I would keep it in stock."
"Here's a great belgian white that'll make any Blue Moon drinking friends wonder how they've ever lived without this beer."
"Straw yellow color with white head that leaves behind beautiful lacing. Aromas of bananas, nuts, yeast, and wheat. The taste is sweet and spicey. The aftertaste is smooth with a hearty texture. An enjoyable beer that can be had, but might be too fruity to have several in one sitting. Another good selection from Allagash!"
"The directions on the bottle instruct you to pour the beer, then swirl the remaining yeast, then pour the dregs on the top. I strongly suggest following these steps. The first bottle I tried, I poured carefully....the result was a boring, transparent straw colored beer with no aroma. Following the directions yields a hazy, cloudy, light straw colored beer with white highlights along the edges...much more appealing and visually interesting. A very small head. The coolest part of the pour was watching the yeast disperse into the beer...it spreads out like a blob. Pouring in this manner also releases a wonderful aroma. I get a muted sweetness with a touch of spices that compliment it well. The taste is initially filled with a belgian spiciness, which eventually yields to a subtle sweetness. I don't pick up any orange or orange peel, but some coriander hits me in the aftertaste. I'm left with a pleasant amalgamation of these tastes on my tongue for quite a while after the swallow. This is a wonderfully quenching and tasting beer. I can't stress enough however, to pour properly to release its full visual and aromatic potential."
"I have a certain BA buddy who shall remain nameless (his BA handle rhymes with foolteacher) who says he doesn't care that much for Allagash beers. He is crazy."
"A very pleasant experience. Refreshing and uplifting, mostly from the feel of the stuff in the mouth. ABV is 5.5? Could've fooled me. Makes me pretty happy and rosey, and I've had a crappy day. Worked like a charm. Try some."
"Overall: An excellent wit that is rounded in flavor with a nice spice to it. Definately worth a try and should become a staple. A great example of an American Wit!"
"A good session beer for some however too weak for me although I just had the Whole Foods 25th which could have altered my taste buds."
"Potentially amusing disclosure: Allagash White was one of the first craft beers I ever bought, and I thought it tasted like soap at the time."
"Thanks Kevin!"
"Honestly, I could of had a Hoegaaden but it's alright for special events leaving the bottle out for marketing status."
"And, yes, a damned fine witbier."
"Drinkability is dangerous."
"drinkability: all day long"
"Body is between light and medium, right where it should be. Texture is slick, wheaty, and creamy. Carbonation is soft and effervescent. Hugely drinkable, just hook me up to an IV full of Allagash White and I'll be set for the rest of summer."
"The Allagash White is an outstanding beverage. Arrives from the tap in a slightly hazy golden color. The head is white and plentiful. The smell is a nice mixture of spices, with a citrus overtone. The taste is exceptional. A highly drinkable beer. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability was very good, especially goes down well in the summer heat."
"poured a medium amber color with modest white head that feel to a thin ring. Smell is nice and spicy with an abundance of cloves. Taste is mainly of cloves with lemon and corriander inthe background. Finish has a bit of a bitiness that I don't overly enjoy in this type of beer. Good drinker."
"Drinkability: I like this beer better in the bottle. Perhaps because I served it warmer. Regardless it is a good beer."
"I'm basing my ratings on a recent mission to submerge myself in unfiltered wheats. This is a fine brew, and very much exemplifies the American varieties of the style."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a nonic. The beer is a cloudy pale yellow that is even paler on the edges and it has a 1 finger bone white head that doesn't leave a lot of lacing. Smells delicious - oranges, coriander, banana, pepper, spiciness, and yeast, all blended together nicely. The aroma is fairly subtle but strong enough to get some good whiffs. The taste follows suit but with an addition of spicy hops and a mild bitterness that complement the other flavors. It has a medium body that is kinda tingly yet smooth, with the last sip having the best mouthfeel. The drinkability is high as it is a complex and refreshing beer but the flavors aren't overwhelming. I could easily see this being a regular in my fridge."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color with a big white head. The aroma is of orange, and corriander. The taste is very nice. Citrusy and spicy, yet still smooth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this is a great interpretation of a witbier. Very enjoyable."
"overall: there's a spice that is just totally dominant. i like it but it could get old. i wasn't overly familiar with the smell of corriander, so i grabbed the spice rack to compare. that's not it. all i can say is that with the mix of orange flavor and aroma, the spice reminds me of russian tea. i'm not a huge fan of this style, so i havn't had many other examples to compare this to. however, if this is your style, i feel i can highly recommend this witbier."
"This belgian white from Allagash pours a wonderful cloudy golden yellow. There is a slight head which disapates nicely, but leaves lacing thougthout the entire glass. The scent is smooth and fresh. The scent of citrus is what you expect and exactly what you get. I smell lemon, orange and wheat. The flavor is quite the same, with maybe a little cloves. Some spices are evident as you enjoy this beer. I think this is a great belgian white, and if you are a fan of this fresh flavor, then give this a shot. You won't be disappointed."
"Pours a creamy pale yellow with a white haze from the yeast, nice for style. Huge bubbles make up a think white head. Aroma is mostly orange peal with some spice for good measure. Taste is a wonderful mix of lemon, orange, coriander. A touch of sweetness manifests itself reminiscent of apricots. Light in body. Very easy to drink. Light bitterness in the aftertaste. Kind of like after biting an orange rind, but not as harsh. Awesome beer. In my opinion, this is a perfect summer beer. Light and refreshing but not sacrificing the slightest bit of flavor to do so."
"Drinkability: This is a very substantial wit. I personally think the flavor is a bit harsh, but the texture and and scent are fantastic. Not for everyone, but certainly one some folks will love."
"Appearance is hazy amber with a good head of puffy foam and some nice lace. Aroma contains a vanilla soft bread, some herbs, citrus and lemon grass. Initial taste is gentle, followed by yeast, barley, carbonation about right and bitter curacao orange. The flavors wash over the tongue: malt, peach, spice. Very nicely done  complex and well brewed."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a small white head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma begins with a big spice smell that has hints of corriander, orange peel and clove with a malty background of bread and crackers, very classic witbier scent. Taste malty with a nice spiced flavor, you get flavors of of corriander and clove, orange and lemon rind as well as a light peppery note, and the malt flavor and clean and simple; notes of fresh baked bread and crackers. The mouhfeel is smooth and creamy, and the finish is clean and crisp with moderate carboation. Drinkability is extremely good, probably one of the most drinkable beers around, a great summertime brew to say the least."
"Hazy appearance and darker then your average wit. The beer was highly carbonated but not as effervescent as some classic Belgian examples, instead there was a more creamy head. The spicy aromas jumped out of the glass. The beer had the classic coriander/bitter orange flavors, but with more pronounced accents then most wit. These flavors are set inside of a delectable golden ale ripe with malt sweetness and a perfect hop bite. Sorry Hoegarden.. this domestic takes home the blue ribbon!"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin bright white head that quickly fades. Aroma is wheat, orange peels, and a nice blend of spices. Taste is light wheat malt with a strong spicey finish, just a bit of citric tang--very refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium/thin and carbonation is fairly low. This is a really good thirst-quenching beer for the summer."
"The mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied and quite refreshing. Overall, it's quite enjoyable, but not quite impressive. I'm looking forward to seeing how this compares against one of my favorite brewers' (St. Bernardus) which I also acquired thanks to GCBrewingCo."
"Served in a tulip glass with a lemon. Had a nice golden hue, almost cloudy. Served with a slight head on it, which disapated fast. The smell was sensational, had a fruity or flowery smell, but this could be due to the lemon wedge that was served with it. Starts off sweet, almost a citrus orange flavor to it. It was light and easy to swallow, even the aftertase was pleasent. I would order another, maybe this time without the lemon, just so I can get the full effect of the beer. Overall a good choice on a nice summer day."
"the allagash white is a killer witbier. can't wait to go home and savor one."
" Overall a good spring-summer session brew."
"Taste is also very good being quiet bitter for a white, nice sourness, malty and cirtussy with koreander. These american hops do very good with a wheat beer, hell yes! Great mouthfeel completes the party so just want more of these!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and clean. Complex and tasty and with a well balanced spiciness and maltiness. I will gladly drink this one again. Well done."
"First this is an unfair review. I've kept this bottle around far too long. Perhaps over a year. Not fair to a beer that shouldn't be cellar. It poured out golden in color. With a thin surface level head that quickly dissipated in a lot of fizz. Smell is non-existent. Taste is actually quite good if understated. I imagine this would be quite good as a fresh beer. A bit of spiciness remains. Corrinader remains even after all this time. A bit on the dry side. I much preferred the Allagash Tripel."
"Drinkability: I'm not a big wit fan, but this was enjoyable"
"Comments - What a great interpretation of a wit! Very different from other witbiers I have tasted in terms of the spice profile."
"Had this brew last night for the first time and I must say I was impressed. This was a real nice brew, it was pored to a hazy yellow color with a fair sized white head that broke down slow and left a nice amount of lacing through out the brew. Had a very nice aroma, somewhat light with scents of lemon citrus and spices mixed with sweet malt. Taste was very refreshing, light with nice spiciness mixed with wheat like flavors. This will be a brew that I get again, especially with the warmer weather getting here."
"750ml corked bottle ( Thanks Sammy). Decanted to the tumbler a light honey-hued clouded ale with a nice puffy white cap. Moderate effervescence. Wonderful nose...spicey tangerines, sweet and musty. Substantial body for a wit. Lovely sweet malt diffusion at the front then the hops and corriander spice the palate with a tangy citrus peel taste and the yeast gives a pleasant succulent apricot pronouncement. Dryish finish...a very nice and flavorful witbier."
"I recommend this as a good crossover beer to get people accustomed to the Witbier style. For New Englanders, it's also regionally brewed, so it's nice to have a somewhat local product around."
"Pours a cloudy soft yellow, like a yellowish creamsicle, with a huge rocky white head. Lacing was large and sticky all around the footed pils glass. Smelled of lemon and peppery spice. Taste is dry and peppery upfront with some zesty lemon flavor and a wheat crisp finish. Medium moutfeel with plenty of carbonation and long finish. This was a fine beer to have with bbq chicken (which is exactly what we did.) I'll be picking up another 750 when I see one. High quality and high value. Offer this to your Blue Moon drinking friends."
"This Allagash offering pours a very hazy golden pilsner like color. Lots of bubbles rise to the top and a nice sturdy egg white head. Aroma is really yeasty and somewhat citric with a slight acidic burn. The wheat grain seems to be really dominate here with a solid yeast base backing it up. Spices are much less than other wits I have tried. Citric fruits play a nice compliment to the wheaty yeasty base. Quite acidic in the finish with some spices lingering. Definitely got better as I drank it, the 750 was no problem finishing. Overall, a solid beer but nothing more."
"Nice light zesty citrus aroma with a pinch of coriander. Bright white head pours thick, but eventually fades to a solid film leaving strings and patches of lace. Hazy, vibrant straw colored beer with swarms of tiny bubbles rising through the middle. The taste is a mix of light lemony citrus, mild spices, and a little floral hop. Barely bitter finish detracts slightly from the flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and light; the beer almost floats across my tongue. Overall a solid Witbier, but based on price there are others I'd choose first."
"No visible best before date. I wonder if this is an older batch. I may try it again."
"Edit--It appears I may have been getting a cold when I reviewed this beer. I have tried it since getting over it and there are some fairly pronounced spicy aspects that are noticeable--cardomom, anisette, banana and allspice is what comes to mind."
"Lightly bodied but very complex taste, with 5.5% alcohol. This makes for a real good session beer, and I'm glad I picked it up on a whim. Can't recommend it enough."
"One of the best wits brewed in North America. Actually, the only one I like better is Unibroue's Blanche de Chambly."
"Final Thought: One of the best if not the best white I've had. Clearly better than Great Lakes Holy Moses... and that says a lot!"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy yellowish color ale with a big head that disappeared a tad too quickly. Aroma of coriander is easily detectable with some wheat also noticeable in the background. Taste is quite amazing with a nice mix of coriander, wheat and some orange in the background. Very refreshing but with a strong full body and light carbonation. Probably one of the best north American wit I had the chance to drink."
"I actually liked it - a nice change from heavier dark beers."
"Overall, well, I've found a new favorite witbier. It has all the hallmarks of the style, and is more refreshing than my previous favorite."
"Quite a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a hazy straw colour with a decent white head. Aroma is of spice and citrus a bit of bread. Taste is classic Wit wheaty and citrusy with that lovely hint of mystery spice ( yeah i know its coriander, but who eats raw coriander) Mouthfeel is nice with medium carbonation and a clean finish. No surprises here this is what it says it is A Belgian Wit. Drinkability for the style is great. While I am not the hugest fan of the style as I like my wheats to be fluent in German, this is spot on for the style and in my opinion better than Hoogarten"
"Carbonation is perfect for the style, strong, but this beer is still excessively drinkable on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability and Overall: Damn me for only buying one. Looks like I may go back and get a case of this. This is a brilliant session beer, and one that wouldn't get old for a long time. This was my second attempt at Allagash, and so for they're kicking my ass. Up next, the Dubbel Reserve."
"Drinkability: I'm drinking this now in January, but I'm sure I could drink many around a BBQ in the heat of a summer day. At 5.5% it could easily be a session beer, and if I can ever find a case of it I'll probably be doing it in the future. Bravo, Allagash."
"This is a pretty good wit. Lots of flavors that defines a witbier, but quite soft on the palate. Good stuff."
"Very refreshing beer. Will definitely buy again. Have to try a face-off with Hogaarden."
"Oveall, this is a solid white, and a very nice way to spend a warm afternoon. I'll gladly have another!"
"Much better in the bottle. When had on tap, so many taps very much suspect it wasn't too fresh. Richer and better colour in bottle. Still spice, prticularly corriander, but carbonation rich and alive. Thanks to donator from USA at Doug Shoemaker party."
"The smell is very enjoyable, holding a great blend of spices. The taste in the mouth builds on that, bringing light malts into the picture along with more spices and touches of various fruits. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth while the drinkability is very good."
"A very drinkable white beer for sure! I had this pint on-tap at Big City in Allston (Boston). This brew is a cloudy golden yellow colour with a nice white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma consists of coriander, wheat, lemon, yeast, and more spices. The taste is lemony and refreshing up front, spicy in the middle, and smooth and wheaty in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy/smooth and refreshing so the drinkability is very, very good. Better in 750's but still a damn good brew on tap."
"This would be great on a hot day. Not my favorite style but I rather enjoyed this. Good drinkibility."
"Taste is tart, with a touch of salt. Limes, oranges--citrus! Edged with some barley grains that added body. Mint leaf after dryness mixed in the bitter hop background. I would've really liked to have 2 or 3 more of these."
"Pours a cloudy hazy pale yellow with a nice white head that leaves spotty lace down my glass. Aroma is grainy wheat bread like yeast bananas light cloves and peppery spice not bad but have had better. Taste is zesty flavored bready grains with some fruity sweet bananas coming threw. Cloves and light spice take over then pepper mingles with hops for a spicey tart finish. Mouthfeel a smooth medium but light at the same time. Drinkability is good not the best witbier but very good for the price would buy again."
"This concoction looks more like a banana smoothy than a beer. Bright almost neon-yellow color, yet thick looking and almost opaque, with yeasty dots floating up and down and a frothy head. Smells wheaty, yeasty, bready, lemony and tangy, with a hint of some spices. This beer is very flavorful, but subtle at the same time. Lots of tastes coming atchya. Bread and yeast take over, but there are still lots of noticable complexities like Belgian spices and lemon zest. This beer while being rather light, seems to have a very medium-full body, very thick tasting and smooth in the mouth. An amazingly drinkable beer - it's one of those beers that you finish before you realize because it's too hard not to take those big gulps. Yum."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Mouthfeel was thin, and although the taste was OK, this one could get old rather quickly. I wouldn't want more than two of these."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4"" bright white head above a slightly cloudy yellow brew. Head faded to a layer of bubbles rather quickly, and lacing was average. The 1/4"" of bubbles returns with a quick swirl of the glass, however. Aroma is of wheat and yeast. Taste is somewhat bitingly of wheat and yeast, in a pleasant way. Mouthfeel is just what I would expect for the style, and drinkability is excellent. Great stuff."
"This beer, compares favorably with the Hoegaarden that I had before it, a bit more golden than Hoe, also less of a head, but same citrusy aroma, and taste, a bit more sharp of a taste, but very comparable, very drinkable! recommended! I just recently started to drink these, and I find them delicious and refreshing!"
"Allagash White was the last of the summer seasonals in my fridge, and a perfect end to the season. Easily the best witbier I've had, much more flavorful than imports like Hoegaarden and the domestic craft brews I've tried. Highly recommended."
"A good deal of yeast in the pour turns this into a beer cloudy enough to be nearly opaque--I can barely see my fingers on the other side of the glass through the hay/pineapple colored liquid, let alone any visible carbonation. Nice. Small, spotty head of bright white bubbles is somewhat disappointing in terms of both size and cling. Smells come rushing right out of the bottle: candied ginger, over-ripe pear skins, and (with a generous amount of imagination) pie crusts. Nosefeel is a complex balance of powdery and moist but diminishes substantially over time. Prominent flavors of (curacao?) orange peel, coriander, and more ginger than clove. A pear-like sensation in midpalate operates as a base for this complex spice profile. Mouthfeel is very wet, wheaty, and quenching before being puntucated by a peppery dryness, especially at sides of the palate. I had a bit of difficulty describing the actual complexities, but this is most drinkable. This was from a 12oz. bottle and I'd like to compare this with the 750ml version."
"tap at blind tiger. Extremely cloudy pale yellow hue. Classy looking. Highly carbonated, but creamy mouthfeel at the same time. I love the expressive malt in here, cookie-ish and grassy. Lots of lime flavor, smooth witbier that manages to be flavorful and feel as light as can be."
"Overall a balanced and very drinkable beer. Good summer beer, but the lack of head really was disappointing. Not one bottle of my six-pack kept a decent head."
"Drinkability: About as drinkable as beer gets, especially outside in 90 degree weather at a BBQ."
"Tasty brew, not a Duvel but still good."
"The beer beer poured a golden yellow with shades of orange. The head on this one was a thing of beauty. Fluffy and white and it adorned the glass for quite a while. The nose was malty with hints of citrus fruits and bananas. The taste was smooth with the orange and spice flavors really coming through. Long, long finish turning slighty bitter as it lingers. An exceptional witbier, a real thirst quencher on a hot summer night."
"Clean, crisp and perfect on a hot summer day. Highly recommended."
"A very good offering from Allagash that is a superb thirst quencher. Had there been a touch more flavor, I would have loeved this beer."
"-Oelergud"
"No head despite a pour straight down the middle of the glass. Cloudy as fresh grapefruit juice. Smells lemony, tastes lemony with a mild spiciness and grainy background. Tart finish. I keep expecting to see lemon pulp in the glass. I'd love to have a lemonade that tasted like this, but as a beer it's a bit dull."
"A very quality example of a wit right from good ol' New England. A perfect ale for the summer."
"my first allagash in a long time...why? i don't know, because their stuff is available at many places around here. anyway, this one pours a nice cloudy golden colour with a thin white bubbly head. i would've like a bit more of a fluffier head here, but overall a decent appearance. the smell isn't bad either, but could have been a touch bolder. main notes are of citrus and some wheat. the taste is very citrusy. it's sweet up front and has a dry wheat flavour in the middle then anothe sweet and slightly juicy kick at the finish. orange flavouring dominates here. the mouthfeel is quite nice. there's almost a frosty drink feel at times because the carbonation level is cranked up rather nicely on this one. a nice summer thirst quencher and a nice representation of the style."
"Pours hazy translucent yellow. Generous head, huge bubbles, very effervescent. Smells of yeast and a hint of citrus. Nothing bad in the smell at all. Taste is extremely smooth, again yeast and a very subtle hint of citrus. I would like a little more citrus, actually. The word to define this beer is smooth. No overpowering tastes, just straight beer."
"This poured out a dull yellow that was quite cloudy and had about a fingers worth of white head. Decent retention as it eventually fell to a bubbly cap it left good lacing about the glass. Aroma is comprised of a slight lemon scent with notes of spice and yeast mingling about as well. Taste is very similar as a wheaty yeasty flavor is supported by a zesty lemon and a bit of spice. This is very effervescent and has a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good as is the carbonation and it is very drinkable. Overall a good, refreshing example of a witbier."
"Thanks to Quaffer for this one."
" Overall: This is a perfect example of an American witber in terms of flavor and body. It's one of my favorites of this style and is highly recommended"
"Slightly more bitter than it's 750 mL counterpart this is still a fine example of a Belgium White. I first had this beer in the summer of 2000 in Ongonquit Maine while vacationing with my family. It was a treat back then, as I was just beginning to branch into craft beers at the time."
"The mouthfeel is lightly crisp with a partially dry finish. The wheat and spice seem to linger for a bit on the tongue. Very drinakable as this has nice flavor and is not boring."
"This is a very drinkable well balanced beer. The flavor is not as strong as other belgian styles beers, but is quite refreshing."
"This is my first Allagash --- I'll start off by saying that Beligian style is definitely not my favorite but I do enjoy a good wit bier occasionally. The poured a cloudy peach color with a super foamy head (even with a medium pour) and left slight lacing down the glass. The smell was citrus (lemons) and spicey. The taste was very refreshing, more fruits and spices (coriander as per the bottle). The mouthfeel was slick and clean with a pleasant aftertaste. A little astringent and a fair amount of ""fizziness"" but overall a very nice wit. This was very nice after spending a few hours repainting my sunroom, but I would still grab a hefe before a wit beer anyday... that's just me"
"750 mL bottle Batch 10 - It pours a cloudy pale gold (almost white in color) with a big creamy white head. The head doesn't stay large, but it lingers as a thin covering for the beer until the end. The aroma is citrussy with some spice, a delicate hoppiness, and some sweetness. The light body is has some creamy malt and corriander seems to be present. It finishes with a nice spicey bitterness. A nice crisp, refreshing beer."
"I was pretty excited to try this one. Anything that is brewed with spices catches my eye immediately. This poured very pale colored and the head was very fluffy and white. The nose is very refreshing. As this beer heads towards the back of the mouth, heavy doses of clove show up. There seems to be a hint of cinnamon left on the tongue. This one is a pretty complex beer with tons of different flavors. Definately an advanced beer in my mind."
"Allagash suggest serving their ales served in 750ml bottles be served at cellar temp, the same suggestion should be made for this ale. The complexity comes out as it warms and the carbonation mellows. When I first had this, last year, it was the first time I had a beer that didnt taste like beer. Id suggest it to anyone who doesnt like beer because of the taste."
"This is a good white, though not exactly what I expected. I prefer a Sam Adam's White to this."
"Taste: I remember this being heavier and sweeter. This time, came across as grainy and dry. Light grass transformed into hints of light spiciness and citrus flavor. Less of those two flavors than most other wits. Dried out to a grainy finish."
"Allagash White was served from a 750ml corked and caged bottle labeled ""Batch #11"". In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a hazy pale golden and was topped by a wonderfully thick, creamy, and unyielding bright white head. The nose presented a light lemon/orange citric peel spritziness, spiced with coriander...nice but could use more flair and oomph. The taste was light on the palate as well. A quenching grapefruity lightly acidic base emited shy accents coriander as the aggresively bittered dry citric finish engages the taste buds. The finish is quite clean leaving only light traces of lingering citric peel/coriander essence. The beer succeeds in the quenching/refreshing department. While the upfront flavor is a bit lacking in intensity, the finish was very well done for the style. I felt the body was a tad thin, though it was smooth to the touch. The carbonation was fine and fluffy, meshing well with the flavors and personality of the beer. This light and crisp white was very drinkable, especially on the warm sunny day of this tasting."
"Cleanly fermented with great characteristics of the style, this one is easy to drink owing to it's subdued carbonation and it becomes more perfumy and floral as it warms. Completely gratifying, this is an excellent brew and would easily replace Oberon as my summer beer if it was available in my area."
"Drinkability: nice brew in the warmer months"
"As wheat beers go, this was strong."
"Notes: Love the cork, love the label, love the head!"
"After drinking a diet of Stouts and Porters for the past several reviews, I decided to visit one of the first styles I had tried, i.e., a wheat style brew. The cloudy, lemon yellow appearance with great lacing invites you to drink. The smell is fruity and yeasty...as my wife aptly put it, almost like pizza dough. The taste is light...with initial fruitiness, followed by a dry, slightly astingent quality that is very crisp. I like this dry, refreshing mouthfeel and could drink types like this all night. Very drinkable...would be an extremely nice brew in the warmer months (if tehy ever come agian!)"
"The predominant aroma and taste I got from this was apricot. The beer had a nice tang to it, naturally cloudy, and not too carbonated. Could have been a bit more yeasty in flavor, perhaps a little more hops. Just a bit too watery. Overall I enjoyed it."
"Pale yellow color with little head that leaves quickly. There is little lacing. This beer has a nice spicy aroma and hints of citrus. There is a hint of hops as well. The taste is a very nice blend of spices and I get a sense of grapefruit and orange flavors. This is a very silky smooth beer that leaves a strong crisp taste in my mouth. This is a quality belgian style wit beer and makes me long for spring time."
"ng"
"12 oz bottle at cellar temperature pours into a tulip glass a bright, but hazy, yellow colour. A tightlyknit white head of minute bubbles eventually settles into some sheets of lacing. Aroma is of a Belgian strong ale, minus the alcohol. Banana, lemonzest, yeast, cloves, and coriander. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, with a tonguebite of pepper and hops. Taste is pleasantly complex, with lemon, musty yeast, wheat grain, and a spice array featuring green peppercorns and coriander. Carbonation is medium and plays into the mix quite well. Aftertaste is clean, with a note of mild pepper. Malts stay subdued in this Allagash, but I can easily understand why this white ale is the flagship of this fine Maine brewery. Very well crafted and easily drinkable."
"Tart & lemony, spicy, & plenty of hops. Bone dry finish. So damn good on tap, it should be illegal."
"I don't know if I would label this is a white, so I am not going to dock it any points for stylistic impuritires. Banana, clove and citrus were quite evident in the aroma and quite balanced. I could see where some people would not appreciate the balance in the beer that is IMO it's strongest point. Soft coriander and zest are quite evident but blend nicely with the sweet wheat flavors. Color was a cloudy yellow that, depending on pour, could clear up nicely. Finish is quick and easy... on the light side but this adds to it's drinkability. High quality brew. Look forward to trying some more Allagash brews."
"Taste is lightly sour and yeasty. Citrus flavors underlying. Tasty wheat malt with a good bit of spiciness. Very light and crisp on the palate. Soft sour aftertaste. A very drinkable beer, easy to finish a 750ml solo. Damn good and it's even better as a summer beer."
"Medium-sized, white, noisy, dense, foamy head. Hazy, dirty yellow body. Citrus in the nose and just a little peanutty. Nice. Citrus and major pepper in front. Some burnt crackers. Middle turns tangy, sourish, fruity. It's almost a little milky tasting. Bitter finish, more pepper, grains and some burnt toast. Hm. Very bitter at the end. This is really good. It's better with the yeast pour, I think. Quite milky/tasty. More buttery with temperature."
"This is the best tasting wit I know. Not that I am the all encompassing wit authority, but this is just delighful. So chewy and grainy, with just the right balance of hop at the end. Lots of citrus and fruit come through with just a hint of spice. Very crisp mouthfeel and highly drinkable."
"Comments  JohnnyDuvel handed this one to me when I was down in Florida on vacation. He actually gave me two of them  BA Bros are the best!"
"I've had this before, but for whatever reason, hadn't rated it. This time I had the small bottle (as opposed to the 750). This is a wonderful, crisp, refreshing wit. As good as any I've had in this style. Ultimately, I prefer their triple, but this is nearly as good. Appearance as you would expect, light golden color, small head with some retention. Fruity, somewhat dry taste. I find that Allagash has a distinctive taste, which is there in all of their styles. Tangy, refreshing beer."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a white spotty lace head. The aroma is of Belgian pale malts and yeast. It seems a bit weak and watery. It does have a fruity scent that is appealing . The taste is decent, but again it seems to be a bit watery and weak. There is a fruity aftertaste that lingers. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinker, but I just don't care too much for Allagash beers. Ommegang is so much better."
"As I said earlier, perhaps I expected more based on others reviews. This is not a bad beer by any means, defiantly above average. But I think I let my high hopes get the best of me, and I wound up being underwhelmed."
"I finally got my west coast hands on some Allagash (dubbel and tripel to follow) and am most impressed with the first sample. It pours a hazy yellow that's reminiscent of a refreshing glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade. The foamy white head settles a bit but leaves traces on top and sticking around the edges of the glass. Going along with the lemon appearance is a very nice citrus smell with just a trace of spice. The taste is sour but not overwhelmingly sour and as smooth as silk. After giving this a try on its own, I used it to wash down some tortilla chips and spicy salsa and it really worked well. I'm looking forward to resampling this on a hot summer afternoon."
"Overall Impression: A tasty wit. A bit subtle in my opinion, I like a wit to really grab me and make me salivate. This was more pleasant and well mannered. It is a good hot weather beer, but not quite a lawn mower. No problems with drinkability, but I dont find myself craving another. Suggested, but only if you are into wits."
"Backwash: Another great effort from Allagash. I’d sought the 750’s of this for some time, and finally found them at Finger Lakes Beverage in October. Although I think of this as a “warm-weather” beer, I couldn’t stop myself from trying one. It showed all of the finesse and complexity I’ve come to expect from Allagash, combined with wonderfully executed bottle conditioning. Allagash really does this well. The spices are well-integrated and not over-wrought. Very effervescent and thirst-quenching; just the thing for a Summer day! I only wish I didn’t have to go to Ithaca to get it!"
"The taste is very tangy. Very fruity, and all around wonderful. Not heavy at all. The mouthfeel is perhaps a tad sharp, but overall this one is a good, light, fruity beer. A pleasure to drink."
"Served a pale hazy yellow straw amber with a big white head. Sweets with some citrus tones lead the flavor pack. Also the yeast and some spices come through quite strong. The flavors are not balanced to where I would like them. Mouthfeel is thin and carbed. This beer did not come close to living up to the hype which surrounds it. Drink less Maine beer."
"I can't really express how disappointed I was with this offering from Allagash Brewing Co. Described as their flagship beer, I thought this would have had a lot more character than a flat, bitter gunmetal flavor. With no markings on the bottle to give me an idea as to a ""best before"" date, I can only hope this particular bottle was simply past its prime and not the norm."
"75 cl bottle. Poured a nice orangy-yellow that started pretty clear but once the entire bottle was split between two tumblers, the color turned even cloudier with a big thicket of white foam. Aroma of malted wheat, orange zest and coriander typical of the style. Seemed to have a watery aftertaste yet that mouthfeel told me that this one seemed to have more body that most Belgian whites. Hmmm... enigmatic. Very drinkable, though. I'd buy one again."
"lumpy weird looking white head, over a nice looking bright yellow beer. very cirtrusy smell, a bit bready with a hint of cloves. the taste is also very fruity, i pick up lemon, grape, and a hint of banana with the cloves coming through bit in the taste too. this yeast provides a nice flavor as well. mouthfeel is a little thin but my no means bad, just feel like it should have a little more body. I could put away a number of these in one sitting so i'm givving it a pretty high drinkability"
"Notes: Really enjoyed this."
"Overall - A fine (and dandy) brew. Yippidee doo!"
"This beer pours a hazy dark yellow color with a thin off-white head. Very little lacing. Aroma is very spicy with pepper, coriander and some citrus. Light-bodied and crisp with a spicy and fruity character, with yeast flavor as well. The finish is sweet, fruity and clean. This is a solid Wit."
"Pours a cloudy straw-golden color with a light, creamy head. Spicy nose with a hint of banana and coriander. More spiciness on the palate, although I can't pick out any specific flavors. Progresses from spicy to bitter with a dry finish. Decent mouthfeel, especially with the tingly feeling all of the spice gives. Overall, though, I'm not really a fan. It lacks the overt coriander and pleasant spice blending of Hoegaarden or Celis White, or the subtle balance of Wittekerke. Probably not going to buy this one again."
"For some reason this was much better on tap. It was much fuller in body and the flavors worked together much better than the 12 oz. bottle version. Poured a cloudy yellow color with a sudsy, loose head with big bubbles. Smell was much wheatier without the veggie-like smells of the bottle. Tons of musty yeast worked in with a bit of a bready finish. The taste was refreshing yet filling with a harvesty wheat flavor and just a slight bit of cloves and orange/lemon to give it a proper spice for a autumn eve. Mouthfeel was much thicker and creamier with just as much carbonation. I think I am starting to see what others do in this beer. Since I was so dissapointed with the bottle version I was afraid to try this, but I'm glad I did."
"Drinkablilty: Not a beer for me. Still have not attained an enjoyment for this style."
"Yes, this beer rules. Appearance is that of a typical wit. Unfortunately, not much of a head, but I really could care less with a beer of this caliber. With a wonderfully refreshing yeast and subtle spice flavor, perfectly carbonated mouthfeel, perfect ABV, this makes a great session brew. Also would make a good ""crossover"" beer as it's virtually impossible not to like it."
"WONDERFUL! An exceptional beer. The aroma has hints of banana, corriander and orange. The combination of orange & corriander make the Belgian White one of my favorite beer styles. This is equal to the old Celis White or Hoegaarden White. It's no wonder this just won a gold medal at the GABF!"
"Murky pale golden hue. Solid, burly porcelain white head leaves steadfast lace. Vibrant combination of orange peel and sweetly herbal coriander dominates the aroma, although a tepid clove undertone adds a mildly phenolic contrast. Mellow yeast must and banana esters surface as the beer warms. Well rounded and judiciously spiced aromawise. Brusque snap of bready sweet malt initially in flavor yields to a soft melange of curacao bitterness, gentle clove, and a balmy, lemon like acidity. Residual sweetness augments as it warms as does the subtle banana ester component, eventually lending an agreeable, mellow banana bread impression late. Lightly bodied overall, but pleasantly viscous, and slightly silky from both the suspended yeast and oat glucans. Finishes mostly clean, with fleeting hints of candied lemon and freshly ground coriander. Allagash White is a superbly spiced wit that sits very softly on the palate. A bit tame in yeast derived character, but highly enjoyable and tasty nonetheless. Spot on."
"Part #2 of the Z-Test Adventure."
"Not my favorite witbier, but certainly a good one. Hopefully, this will be the first of many Allagash reviews. I may well have this wit again."
"What a nice color! A work of art-very vibrant, hazy, almost electric yellow. A nice snowy head and good stick add to the picture. Quite a citrus kick on the aromatics with heady spices as well. In the mouth the beer kicks, stings, bites, and thrusts. The body is quite robust for the style, and zippy citric acid flavors pop up and sting the sides of the tongue. Very forceful in the way of coriander with the orange influence hiding in the background, and showing its self in the way of orange zest. All in all a nice balance of flavors. The beer finishes strong with a modest touch of bittersweet. This is a full throttle Belgian white and perhaps the strongest I've had to date. A real treat that I think must have just arrived in the Chicago market. Go get em!"
"Absolutely a world class witbier. Definitely a benchmark for the style. Very drinkable, I could sip one (or three) of these every night."
"Allagash is easy to enjoy, especially if you like a little bit of spice."
"I was quite impressed - this is ne of my new favorites."
"What a wonderful find and surprise. When poured it was a light yellow hue with loads of foam. Pour very slowly. The aroma of fruit really filled the nose and with a hint of a citrus nature. The taste was smooth and fruity with a slight citrus on the palate. I really like this white and would recomend it to my friends, highly! Final say, fruity, with a hint of citrus and spices!"
"Dayton, OH AleFest:This beer's appearance was a small sized white head with fine sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was cloudy and the hue was pale yellow.The nose was fruity, citrusy and spicy.It had a light bitter flavor to it and the mouthfeel was smooth."
"This beer poured a cloudy lemon yellow with a hint of orange. The head had good retention and was snow-white. Had a very yeasty aroma, also with a strong banana presence. The taste was nicely balanced between a sour citrus and a hop bitterness, and a tiny bit of spice. Overall a pretty good white, featuring a full flavor while still being nice and light and most of all refreshing."
"An aroma of orange, coriander and an herbal citrus nose. This beer is a pale gold color that is nicely cloudy (thus the white). Lightly refreshing and well carbonated as well. Tastes nicely spiced, with fruity notes, citrusy and a bit of coriander in the finish. Ends with a bit of sharp acidity on the tongue. A good well balanced, and easy drinking wit."
"Poured to instructions on the bottle. Deep cloudy yellow with an immense white head with swirling yeasts. Smells peppery, hints of yeast, grains and some citrus--orange peel, maybe coriander? Big spices up front with a mellowing citrus and very little bitter. Superb level of carbonation. Sour yeast and wheat with orange peel, maybe some pear flavors in the middle. A nice peppery after taste. I was somehow reminded of grilled trout [not in taste] but triggered by the tastes. Awesome! Fantastic flavors and exceptional drinkability. I agree with Kluk and say that this is the best Witbier brewed in the U.S.!"
"I first had this beer on tap over a year ago at a Belgian beer tasting hosted by the Brickskellar. It was the only non-Belgian beer featured and the emcee made sure to point this fact and the fact that it was forming lace on plastic sampling cups. It was definitely the hit of that night."
"Handsome cloudy orange-yellow hues. Stickey foam head sticks to the sides of the glass. White-pepper, coriander, fennel, orange peel on the nose. Complex and subtle tones flood over the palate, anise, fennel, orange peel, and oats. Soft and subtle up front, moving to an almost robust finish. Leaves feeling creamy and delectable."
"Overall a very interesting and yummy beer. Belgian white meets american fruity hefeweizen with lots of great spice and fruit. Perfect for sitting by the fire in the dead of winter or on a warm summer afternoon."
"Saw a case of this at the distributor (one of only 3) and had to buy it. $27.99 isn't too shabby, and in the last week of July I knew I had a good month left to polish these off. First off, I tasted this while sitting on my roof in the sun, and I feel that such summer doldrums invariably help any witbier review. The beer pours a hazy golden, darker than Hoegaarden, lighter than Whirlwind, with noticeable haze and yeast. Smell of light citrus and stong spice, (corriander) sneak through a thick smell of yeast. The first taste is, well, amazing. The flavors are complex, with a certain bit of sweetness in the beginning that quickly gives way to a spicy aftertaste. There's orange/lemon zest, vanilla, clove, nutmeg, corriander, and pepper to name a few. The taste is incredibly refreshing, and this beer has a lot more life to it than other whites, as there is strong carbonation in the form of miniscule bubbles that rise to the top. Head retention is not there, as the initial 1"" quickly fades to a thin lacing, yet the lacing is immovable from the sides of the glass when drank and dissapates only after 10 minutes or so. The beer is the highest review I've given, and deservingly so. I'd prefer this to Hoegaarden or a list of other Belgians Wits any day. Great job on this one."
"This brew pours a small head of fine white mostly lasting bubbles that left an excellent lacing and a straw yellow colored body. I smelled no discernable aroma from it. It had a tingly mouthfeel and a mild bread flavor. Nothing much here and I was not as impressed with it as others seem to be."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden color, big white head, good lace, and a lot of clingy bubbles in the body. Aroma is lemon zest, other citrus, slightly tart, and some mild spices. Flavor is lemon & citric, some hints of banana (especially as it warmed), light spice, some biscuit, and some bubblegum was detected at the very end. Body is medium-full, lot's of different flavors and things happening as it warmed."
"This beer was served with a slice of lemon. It was a pale yellow color with minimal head. It had a haziness to it also. It had a citric smell to it as well as a citric taste. This beer was smooth and very easy to drink. This beer is a perfect choice for a hot summer afternoon."
"Drinkability - Pretty pleasant, an all around good pick. It contains 'all the flavors of autumn' per my wife. It's good enough for a summer brew, but I think it'll be even better come September when things cool down a bit and a bigger tasting Wit fits the atmosphere."
"This brew is heavy on the spice. I didnt think much of it over all, but I may not be a fan of the style right now. Some of the spices just seemed to strong for most of the taste, left me with an average impression."
"Oh, obviously if I'm saying that I must mean that it's not too heavy on the malts, eh? It is smooth and pleasant."
"Pours a bright hazy golden color with a creamy white head that leaves behind trails of lace on the sides of the glass as you drink. Nose is lemony citrus and spicy coriander with some underlying softer notes of yeast. Medium in body and very smooth, almost silky, in texture with a very fine carbonation. Taste starts off with flavors of grassy wheat and sweet fruit with notes of apricot, lemon, and orange followed by an herbal and earthy spiciness with notes of coriander and clove and finally a bite of white pepper. A fantastic white beer, and a great brew with which to kickoff Independence Day. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma consists of yeast, corriander and pear. Mouthfeel is a thick, creamy and full-bodied. Amazing complexity in the flavor. I initially noticed some vanilla sweetness upfront, almost like frosting. Spices follow shortly after as it glides over the tongue. Some pepper is detected in the midtones. Wheat flavor is not as dominant as the spices, sort of hangs out in the background. Finish sharpens with some bitterness as the smooth texture starts to turn crisp near the back of the tongue. Very good wit and much smoother than I expected."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a pale hazy yellow with one finger of head and ok retention. There is just a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a fruity aroma of pineapple and lemon, very pleasant. The smell also has some spicyness to it. The taste brings the spicyness up front, with even some black pepper to the taste. More fruit in the taste, possibly apples. There are just a few hops present. The mouthfeel is fairly bold, and the drinkability is awesome for this summertime hit."
"Wow. Great execution here -- a prime example of the style. Very pale yellow -- could be a little more ""white"" maybe -- with a nice, dense head and plenty of haze. Aroma is an exercise in near-perfection. Very spicy -- orange, peppery, rich, lemony. The same sensations lead into the palate. It's a little thin on the tongue, but so are a number of other wits, I suppose. Very, very drinkable, and an ideal beer for a hot summer day. This was my first exposure to this beer, and I ended up picking up a bottle after I had it so I could have it again this summer."
"This beer poured a pure golden color with a moderate white head. The lace was failry pronounced from the small residual head that settled out about two minutes into the brew. Slight clove sense in the flavor and a genuine perfume sense in the aroma. This is a fairly refined beer that gives a sense of lightness and refreshment. The mouthfeel is a bit watery. A good summer brew to be sure."
"This white ale has a very citrusy aroma that is complimented by a wonderful slightly bitter taste. Lemons and oranges ran through my palate. The appearance is a hazy white-ish color which is definitely true to style. Mouthfeel is an interesting balance of sharp tanginess and cool smoothness. In general I think this beer fits the category well and is an excellent approach to a Belgian Wit, a style that few brewers in the states attempt to mass market."
"Cloudy hazy light pale golden color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fresh wheat and mild spice-orange flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, great for the style, very refreshing and tasty."
"A hazy yellow body is topped by a pillowy head of bright white foam. It drops in height but maintains a creamy collar and some lacy surface foam. Lacing is slightly limited, but the tiny spots are attractive. In the nose, lemons and spice dance joyfully over a mild, gently sweet malt. The coriander is distinct, but you have to swirl the glass to bring out more of the orange and citrus peel. Quite vibrant! A very fine and gently effervescent natural carbonation gives it an initial crispness on the tongue before it softens into silky smoothness. The body is light and it's immensely refreshing. The flavor displays a softly sweet and lightly tangy wheat malt that's accentuated by gently acidic citrus fruitiness and delicate zesty spices that slowly build on the palate. It finishes with a flourish of yeast character and drying spice before receeding to leave some residual delicately sweet and grainy malt. It's delicate and refreshing, yet very flavorful! Most impresssive."
"Batch #7. Yellow color. Medium head. Aroma is spicy and citrusy with a touch of coriander. A medium bodied whit. Orange coriander and other spices. Somewhat sweet and balanced by its spiciness. Very tasty and extremely drinkable. Just gonna sit back and enjoy this one. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and a touch spicy."
"What's my problem? I was so excited to try this highly-acclaimed wheat ale, but other than a complex, citrusy smell, I could not find much to recommend in this Allagash. It poured bubbly and sparkling, like a deep yellow champagne. OK, that's reasonable enough. But the taste seemed out of whack--off-kilter--like there was too much ginger or cumin or something, and to top it off I found the mouthfeel thin and saucy. I gave the rest to my wife, who absolutely loved it. So, what's wrong with me?"
"Label staes ""Beer brewed with spices"""
"Poured a clear yellow color (where is the sediment) with decent foamy head,aroma was very citruisy and wheaty.Taste was nice anf tart very lemony and spicey with some faint smoky undertones.Very refreshing and easy to drink not my favorite wit beer but still pretty good."
"Cloudy, hazy yellow with a white and frothy head. The head disappeared quickly, but left some nice lacing. The aroma is of fruit and pine. Flavor is a bit yeasty, and has hints of citrus. Mouthfeel is smooth, with even carbonation. That typical wheat flavor is round and firm, making its presence felt, which makes this one less drinkable for me."
"Taste: More citrus, and the peppery, spicy flavors really shine through. Thirsty citrus-peel bitterness that draws my cheeks in and prepares me for the next sip. Creamy mouthfeel with a nice drying finish."
"pours a cloudy yellow with an excellent foamy white head. the nose is full of spice, mostly cloves and corriander. the first time i had this beer was like a revalation...this is what a wit should taste like! it's difficult to explain, but allagash seems to have hit the nail right on the head. full rounded witbeer flavors that are pleasant and quite refreshing. highly quaffable. a most enjoyable summer treat."
"This White poured a slightly hazy, golden yellow color with minimal white foam. The smell was very nice: a fruity, bubble gum aroma, mixed with wheat, orange, and hints of spice. The taste was fruity (grape, banana, pear, apple), with flavors of wheat, hops, yeast, and coriander. The mouthfeel was smooth, with a crisp, slightly bitter finish, and a coriander aftertaste. The body was medium with low carbonation feel. This was a very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: I've found the latest summer beer, folks. Super easy to drink, with such a flavorful taste that really satisfies. The realative lack of any aftertaste really makes this a thirst-quencher. Bring on the Virginia summer!"
"Great Belgian spiced white ale. Pours a orangish, yellow with a cloudy haze. Small head that stayed. Nose of spice, citrus, and wheat that promises something different that your normal hefe. The spice on the nose caries through to the taste. A great variety from your German wheat beers. The spice is such a great twist and a little eye opener."
"This is a great example of a Belgian spiced white ale. I actually believe that this one is even better than Hoegaarden on draught. It pours beautifully, an orangy golden cloudy work of art. It feels like an ultra smooth wheat ale and the flavor is a generous presence of orange and corriander. This one seems to taste better as you drink it and the best mouthful was the last one from the bottle."
"This is my first of this style. Not a bad first step. A refreshing spring and summer beer."
"*The color improved and the beer became more cloudy after pouring the rest of the bottle. (I don't have a 750ml tumbler. but there is a diner down the street frequented by giants, maybe I can swipe one from there.)"
"Poured a murky and very pale yellow with lots of carbonation, a decent foamy head, and thin but sticking lace. Nose was of light wheat, cloves and herbs - sometimes it smelled of quite a cannabis or hay funk - and a dash of a citrus peel. Overall, its scents were soft on the verge of getting crisp. Taste was mainly a soft and mild wheat, almost biscuity, followed then by a quick sweet flavor in the middle, and ending with a citrus zing that is light and quiet. Had a good body  steady, centered, and tasty - as well as decent hops. In time, it took on a creamy tasting finish that was fairly long and dry. The yeast could taste better as it leaves behind a cardboard drynes  not the natural hops, lactic, or sour kinds of dry. Good, relatively cheap, and available."
"This was only the second time I had this. The first one MUST have been bad because. This was before I started taking notes, but I remember it being downright awful."
"This is perhaps my favorite example of the belgian wit style I've had to date. Definately my favorite wit brewed in America. The appearance seems a bit off. Even after swirling the yeast, it is not as cloudy as other wheat beers I've seen, but it still has that pale color characteristic of wits. The spicy aroma mostly coriander with other spices. The taste is intense coriander as well. It seems to be one of the spiciest beers I've had, but that's why I like this style so much and Allagash didn't hold back with the spice."
"Fact is, I drink this stuff pretty often, and when I try to quantify and specify, I find the draft version to be nice but not stupendous. I see others have reviews based on the bottle conditioned product. From experience: now you're talkin'. That is what the fuss is about."
"Appers a pale golden hue with hazy clouded screen augmenting the true color. The enormous creamy head is pure white with traces of yeast runinng through it after the swirl technique was applied to the last few ounces of the pour. I must say this beer is looking very appetizing as a complement to my lunch. The aroma starts with a lemon citrus zing, followed by coriander and other wonderful spices. Floating around in the background of the aroma is a slightly biscuity aroma from the malt that only complements the beer overall. The flavor of Allagash white is a great example of the style yet they really throw in their own flavor into this beer. It combines the spices, slight lemon zing, hop bitterness, and earthy yeasty tones to form an extraordinary balance of flavors. A great session beer that is medium to light and with the addition to the yeast from the bottle is quite filling. As for drinkability very enticing, calling me back for another beer from my six pack. All I can say is that I yearn to find this Belgium style white flowing from a draught."
"Sweet. thats the way I would describe the 1st tase I had of this beer. Very light in color/apperance, cloudy enough to be a wheat, but light enought to be almost pilsner. Very light, very smooth. Clean and with a smooth bite. Nice lace, not much head. Has a definate citrus, but it is now a definate flavor to ti, more like a supporting taste, if you will. This beer is full of subtle mixes of tatse and types, so I would recomend you tast it for yourself to decide. Very good spring and summer beverage, go for it."
"A simply beautiful product from Allagash. Complex and alluring and at the same time refreshing and very quaffable."
"Taste is good, could have a little more body though, but its a good wheat style belgian, lightly lemony, a bit of spice and a very clean wheat backing. Pretty darn good. Its a bit empty on the feel, goes right into the lemony spice and just ends, no real finishing qualities. It's a lighter bodied ale, fresh, lemony, with a slightly dry citrus twinge. You can definately drink alot of this one, goes down super easy."
"Hard to think of a better sit on your deck on a sunny spring day beer."
"""Healthy"" exudes from this for some reason, a very wholesome feel. Would make an excellent hot and humid summer evening beer, preferably with thunderstorms brewing."
"Thanks to Murph for this one."
"Overall a most refreshing and wonderful American version of a Belgian Wit Beer. Perhaps a bit more malty and hoppier than it's Belgian cousin (but it is brewed for the U.S. market). The tap version is a bit crisper and fruitier than the bottle version IMHO. Also beware that servers (even in beer bars) like to serve this one with a wedge of lemon."
"Very crisp and tingly. The start is bready with a lot of yeast. Towards the end, you get a lot of bananas. I expected there to be a blast of citrus in there somewhere, but it was nowhere to be found. I found this to be unique for the style. It had enough to it as it was. Very refreshing brew that really smoothes out after the carbonation dies out a bit. Don't miss this one."
"Allagash White: In twelve ounce bottles. If you are looking for an orange flavored beer, you’ve found the beer! Cloudy golden beer. Not a whole lot of head; what there is tends to cling to the side of the glass. Initial taste is remarkably of yeast, which sweetens up to a pronounced orange flavor. Crispy and carbonated. The aftertaste is more of orange marmalde and a little bit of crispy toast. Not a bad beer, but there are better in the style."
"pat"
"A very tasty and satisfying Belgian-style white ale, mellow and smooth. In 3 words or less: yummy, yum,yum!"
"Taste. The taste is very nice. a smooooth. Again the citrus comes in on the flavor. A bit bitter at the end. Nice body a carbination. Very drinkable!"
"Cloudy yellow with a thin soapy head. Aromas of orange, spice and yeast. Taste is similar to the aroma. Nicley spicy and citric. Refeshing and light bodied. An exceptional summer beer. Less sweet than Hoegaarden to which I compare it favorably. My range of experience with whit beers is not wide but I must say that this is the best example that I have tasted thus far."
"Cheers"
"Batch #3 in 750 ml. bottle. Very pale and hazy golden color with sizable, and extremely foamy head. Very citrusy with obvious orange peel. I also detected some grape hints. Extremely crisp and refreshing. I wish I had drank it on a hot summer day. Very high amount of carbonation, but easy to drink. I certainly did fall in love with this beer, although it was good for the price."
"Overall, a very good example of a Belgian-style wheat beer."
"I have had this beer many times on draft but never out of the bottle. Pours a cloudy, glowing yellow color with a nice white head. Very effervesent with many tiny little bubbles. The smell is sweet orange, citrus and corriandor. The taste is very similar. Citrus, lemon, corriandor, pepper and some yeasty flavors. Better on draft than in the bottle in my opinion."
"A very tasty beer, even better on a hot Summer day, but enjoyable year round."

"Pours a hazy pale yellow color, with a decent lace. On the nose the aroma is slightly spicy, hints of citrus, lemon, or orange. On the palate the flavor consisted of more citrus flavors, lemon, and orange peels, spiciness, coriander, and some pear like fruitiness. The finish is sort of dry. This is very drinkable for a wit style I dont much care for"
"The pour a paradigmatic Chill Hazed golden yellow color, the head bright white in color, the size modest and the texture frothy with the resultant lace stick sheets that cling nicely to the glass. The nose citrus fresh, hints of coriander, quite sweet and pleasing to the senses, start is lightly sweet, the top skinny in feel. Finish bitingly acidic, middling on the hops and quite dry. A very nice representative to the Wit style, quite a pleasure to quaff."
"Lightly carbonated mouthfeel, but ever so smooth. Not as spicy as other Wits, but the subtle hop flavor balances very well with the spices that are in there. A very nice Belgian Wit...there is a good reason this is Allagash's flagship."
"Cloudy pineapple juice color, huge 1 1/2 inch sugar crystal head with big bubbles in the middle. Fruity smells, malty with some citrus, to be sure. Light-bodied with subtle flavors, floats in the mouth and lends some traces of honey and ginger as the carbonation works its way down. Dryish finish, fairly abrupt and brought on by light hops. This is not a huge beer, but tamer and less astringent than I expected. Works as a bubbly, lighter-flavored Wit, and lacks some of the unpleasant aspects of some, to my tastes."
"Not one of my favorets It poured nice, looking good in the glass. Nice cloudy head didn't stick around that long. A pale amber/yellow hue hazy. Good color, nice looking beer. Kind of short on taste not much going on a little spicy a bit of citrus Smokey fruit. The aftertaste was too much a little winey, I didn't care for it and found it hard to finish I wouldn't recommend this one!"
"This is my first time trying a brew from Allagash and I must that I'm extremely impressed. Outstanding!"
"Chalky gold with a big, foamy white head. Spicy, citrusy, yeasty smell. Tart fruity flavor with a big presence of spices and musky yeast. Medium bodied, with a slightly oily hop finish. Very drinkable brew, and provided an excellent start to Thanksgiving dinner!"
"Pours a cloudy pale colour which is actually quite pretty. Definitely one of the finest beers of Belgium. This beer has it all. Nice appearance, good taste and smell, strong mouthfeel and drink it all the time"
"This is by far one of my favorites. Cloudy pale, straw yellow color. Pours a nice foam, which leaves a thin lace that clings to the side of the glass. Smells of citrus, coriander and mild hops. Flavors of lemon and orange seem to entice the taste buds first, followed by the spiciness of coriander. All the while, still tasting the mild undertones of yeast and hops. Left a pleasant after-taste, which didn't seem to hang around for too long. All-in-all and absolutely exceptional brew."
"Cheers!"
"A cloudy straw yellow beer that pours with a white head with decent retention.  Leaves a nice ring of lace at the top of the glass.  The aroma is of yeast and malt, with a straw component in the background.  The taste is heavy with coriander and yeast, with some wheat flavors and a subtle sweetness.  The finish still seems to have some noticable hops as well.  The mouthfeel is good, but nothing exceptional.  This beer is enjoyable to drink, but not a truly memorable beer."
"A very traditional Belgian Style Wit beer. All the flavours and characteristics are pretty damn spot on for a US made brew. One of New England's greats ..."
"On tap at the Great Lost Bear in Allagash's hometown of Portland, ME. This is one of the first good beers I tried. Golden yellow with light orange tints. Foamy, rich, full head, laced down the glass perfectly. Smell was a combination of faint orange peels, coriander kick, and other less pronounced spices. Taste is right on for the style. Citrus, spicy, midly carbonated. Heavier than anticipated, yet very refreshing. I actually prefer this to the Hoegarrden version. Slightly more full bodied and a better finish. A very good beer, one of my favorites, and worthy of a special ocassion."
"It's the typical nice foamy, cloudy yellowish white beer you expect from the style. Big coriander and orange flavor, but not a nice as what I got from the Wittekerke. Nice wheatiness."
"A good example of a Belgian White, but not quite on par with the Hoe.  The flavors were the same (citrus, coriander, etc) but they weren't as distinct as the they are with the Hoe.  The appearance was good, maybe too cloudy?  Overall, one of the better of its type."
"I think this beer lacks what it takes to have the world class status that it has(IMHO, of course).  I've seen a better head on a Bud.  Nice aroma: coriander, orange peel, spicy yeast, very perfumey.  Tastes like it smells, with some wheaty tartness coming into play.  A bit thin and solventy though.  Like I said, not my favorite wit."
"Thank you to Cokes for the sample."
"This beer poured a light, cloudy straw color and formed a small white head that left little lace. Quite a bit of carbonation to it. A citrus and slight hops aroma to it. The taste was of citrus, spice which was probably coriander and some hops. The finish was a touch tart due no doubt to the spice element and the heavy carbonation. A good summer beer."
"Notes: This ale is fine just on its own though the spiciness can hold its own to anything on the bbq grill. A superb wit to be had."
"This is a winner.  Pale yellow, almost white brew with an initial bright white foamy head which sticks around leaving a nice lasting lace on the glass.  Hops apparent in the aroma and first sip, but then integrated into the whole flavor.  Clean tart finish.  Very good summer brew."
"EDIT: Remember when they used to sell this in 6-packs for the same price they now charge for 4-packs? Thanks anyway, Allagash; you're good, but not that good."
"Cloudy white with a tint of orange color.  White head with beautiful lace.  Scent of lemon citrus, hops, and yeast.  Taste begins with soft smooth mouth followed by a burst of orange/lemon flavor and corriander.  The finish is just bitter enough to leave you wanting more.  Lots of suspended yeast in the beer.  Wonderful."
"Recommended at any price. (here in Wisconsin, Allagash White is top dollar, but worth every penny. I can't wait until summer to get the most out of this delightful brew.)"
"Quite a complex brew. One of the best (if not THE best) Wit beers brewed in the US."
"I can't help it, this is my favorite white beer.  Unfornately it has spoiled me and made me very critical when it comes to white beers!  I love that beautiful critrus taste and the way the flavor lingers in the tongue after the last sip.  I have to give the brewer credit on this.  I haven't had an American belgian-style white that can compete."
"OK start at a witbier, but an _extremely_ heavy hand with coriander and hops destroys the thirst-quenching properties that one gets from the best examples of this style.   This beer is nowhere near the wit that Hoegaarden and (the long lamented) Celis White were."
