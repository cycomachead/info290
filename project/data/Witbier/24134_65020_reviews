"Really good version of the style.  Smells like a lemon flavored desert.  Taste is sweet, citrus with a nice little bite from the combo of sorachi ace and ginger.  Very well done."
""
""
""
""
"The best things about this beer are its appearance and flavor. Aroma was slight and body was perhaps a touch thin. They did pretty good with the flavor though and I could see having more."
"Description sounded good.  Perhaps the soriachi hops made it not work for me.  Was an ok wit."
""
""
"Hazy winter sun yellow with moderate white head.  Smells of yeast, lemongrass, light citrus.  Taste is good, a bit sharp on the front, yeat, grass, lemon in the middle, with a clean finish.  I wanted to like this one more than I actually did, but it is overall a good thirst quenching pour."

"Unique spiced flavor to this witbier - nice change of pace on a classic!"
""
""
""
"O:  A bit too much for me in the coriander department, but I'm still really glad I got to try it."
"Literally, the start of it all"
""
"This really was a pretty unique flavor.  I like it for the same reason that I like Allagash: the flavors are well integrated and the feel is quite nice."
""
"12oz can. Drank this with Jambalaya in Charleston. Greatly refreshing, I didn't pick up on the ginger much. Pours semi-hazy light yellow - a little lighter than other wheats. No head and no lacing. Aroma of citrus and some malt. Flavor is mild grass, lemon (yes, lemongrass), and wheat. Low alcohol, and a very crisp finish make this a great brew for hot summer session."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a really good idea but the mixture of the coriander addition and the belgian yeast overloads the taste quite a bit making it a par to slightly sub par wit"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - pretty good variant on a classic style. Cheers!"
""
""
"Another refreshing beer from Westbrook. Pretty standard for the witbier style."
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice different take on the old Belgian Wit. Spicier than normal plus the Sorachi hops give it that lemony appeal."
""
""
"Can from Lazy Dog in Warner Robins. Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Pleasant aroma of wheat malts, bit if yeast funk, ginger, lemon peel, and some additional spice notes. Flavor is light wheat malt sweetness, spices, good amount of yeasty notes, lemon peel, apples. Light bodied with medium plus carbonation. Easy drinking wit with a little flare. Not bad."
"This is pretty good, sessionable, I don't like ginger in my beer, so this isn't something I would drink over and over, but you certainly could if you liked it."

"O- I could probably crush a whole sixer of this stuff and still want more.  Extremely drinkable and very flavorful.  One of my new top 5 American-made witbiers.  So surprised this doesn't have a higher score."

"Elements of a classic wit with extra lemon from the sorachi. I couldn't necessarily discern any extra spice specifically, but there was a mildly unpleasant dryness at the finish. Not bad overall, but not one I would revisit."
""
"A fluffy feel on the tongue starts it off exceptionally smooth before some crispness comes in biting a bit.  It moves from semi-dry to semi-sweet with the herb translating to the mouthfeel."
""
""
"O: the beer has a good unique taste to me but I don't like the hefeweizen-style taste of honey baked ham.  Beer is true to style but not my favorite style.  Interesting take though."
""
""
""
"O-An average tasting wit, nothing offputting."
""

"Overall; if i had access to this beer in my area, this would probably be an occasional repurchase, particularly in the summer, to me this beer is what Blue Moon tries to be, a flavorful, light, casual drinking experience."

"This beer is tasty, but very muted. Good for drinking at a barbecue at an easy 5%."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not a fan of ginger, but Westbrook executed this very well. This is what they intended, and they pulled it off. Its just a question of whether you like ginger and lemongrass in your witbiers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deeply pastel yellow with a softness to a slight hint of orange hue. Milky , hazy and a scant head of white foam. Visually very appealing even thought the head does fall off fast and leaves only a think ring. Nose is lemony with a touch of ginger for a back note. It has a cracker like malt scent on the nose. Tall wheat with a perfume that is a touch sweet. A bit of spice form the sorachi ace hops but not too much. Pervading sweetness. The taste is a creamy and soft malt on a delicate hop body. The ginger is very understated but it lends a bit of lightness to the drink rather than heat or spiciness. Lemongrass uplifts the nose and this one is delicate and yet has a fullness on the palate that is all about flavor and not heaviness. The wheat is naturally sweet, crisp, dry but also soft. Yielding. Has a nice juicy middle without any real tartness and a delicate blending of the hops and the what malt finish it not dry but with a touch of sweetness."

"This was alright. Witbiers aren't my favorite style, but like most Westbrook beers, it was executed well."
""
""
""
" The taste is very good with tons of malt in the initial taste and gentle creaminess from the yeast which also adds a light fruit element with nice toasted flavor coming through and gentle tangy wheat quality throughout with mellow spice. Overall I enjoyed this -very good interpretation of the style and pretty yeasty with very good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a great refreshing beer that would pair very well with all sorts of foods. Asian food as well as backyard grill. If you see it, get it."
""
""
"It pours a golden hue similar to what one would have seen from Angkor Wat's spires rising from the green jungle. The smell of lemongrass scented stir-fries is followed candied ginger desserts. The piercing spice of the bitter hops refreshes the palate. In fact, this beer nearly nails all the peripherals of witbier. But there is no sweetness in flavor; the spiciness of the ginger is refreshing, but one-dimensional. It would be the perfect compliment to anything spicy. But the taste alone is nothing lustrous on its own."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy/milky gold. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight ginger, hint of citrus, hint of hop, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, slight ginger, hint of coriander, yeast, slight citrus, and a hint of hop. Overall, the ginger isn't too strong and the appearance, aroma, and body are good."
"Very light hazy color poured in a glass. Mouthfeel is like a typical pale ale/ipa. At first sip you get a very crisp refreshing hop flavor with minimal bitterness. A little citrusy with a perfect blend of spices. Very good and would buy again In a heartbeat."

"I picked up a 6 pack of this for my husband, since he's a huge Witbeir person. After his first sip, his comment, was ""Damn, this is good"". And I'd have to agree. I like Witbeirs, but the White Thai actually reminded me a bit of a Hefeweisen too. It's very smooth, and lightly floral and sweet. I see this as being one of my go to beers to drink at my neighborhood pool."

"Overall, this is a good beer, but not great. It doesn't quite deliver on the spices it boasts of on its packaging, but its appearance in the glass and feel on the palate are both top notch. I wouldn't pass this up if it were offered to me with some Szechuan noodles, but I doubt I'd seek it out again otherwise."

"i would have liked to see more sorachi ace hops in this. i mean, i know its not a hop forward style or anything, but they are so unique and would have complimented the flavors here really nicely, but instead they are extremely muted, just subtle lemon in the finish that might just as possibly come from the lemongrass. fun beer though, frothy and well carbonated and lower in alcohol, a nice interesting summer session. i appreciate the subtle use of ginger, usually in beer its just way too much, almost hot, defeating the purpose to some extent. here its just a little twist that marries well with the wheat malt, while the meadowy sort of grassy tones make it a nice spring seasonal. more sorachi ace character would make this one of a kind, but i still appreciate this unique take on a wit. westbrook has done a great job of tweaking classic styles to make entirely new beer, and this is a great example of that."
"O- A nice take on a witbier. Very sessionable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is hazy golden yellow with a tight white head and decent lacing. Nose is a fair bit of lemon, light yeast note, and a hint of pepper, some grassy, herbal hops in back. Taste has more spice to it, lemony up front with a hint of banana. Stronger pepper spice comes in behind, flavors thin out a little bit through the finish, grassy hop, a bit herbal. Strong carbonation and a lighter body."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is drinkable, but I'd love to taste those other flavors advertised as that would take this beer from ordinary to really great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I wanted a beer to drink all night - this would easily be it - lots of complexity, but still easy-drinking, and perfect at only 5% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A unique and interesting beer but a little too much clove and banana presence for me. I agree with others that the lemon and ginger notes could be stronger and would enhance the beer even more. Still a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unique beer. Very drinkable."

"Overall - A very refreshing and well balanced beer. The flavors play off each other nicely between the spice and citrus notes. I was able to have both this and One Claw from Westbrook and have been really impressed. Hoping to have Gose at some point soon."
""
"White Thai is my first offering from this South Carolina brewery and, although far from their highest rated beer, was still an immensely positive first impression; Westbrook Brewing have gotten a lot of high praise and it's easy to see why. They clearly know what they're doing (and seem to do it very well). Next time I'll be buying every beer of theirs I see."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer at all, it's refreshing and a bit of a twist on the Wit style. The only problem is that the Thai elements need to be amped up. While it sounds delicious to have lemongrass in a Wit, you're left wanting after a taste- everything's just a bit too muted. The beer isn't terrible. just too bland, soft, and boring. Amp up the Thai elements and add some crispness and it could be stellar."
""
"Canned 10/14/13. Hazy golden almost yellow pour with a quite nice head and long lasting lacing. Slight nose of Belgian yeast with lemon and banana notes over a spicy character. Medium bodied with a nice slick mouthfeel and normal carbonation. A quite interesting, but not overbearing, taste of ginger and lemon. As it warms, the lemon flavor takes on more of a zest quality. Crisp finish with a nice tart and bitter kick."
""
""
"Poured into sam adams glass, one finger head developed with mild lacing and retention, was white in color. Appearance was a very hazy lemon / orange color. Aroma was of citrus and some allspice with some hop and yeast notes. Tasted of spice and citrus with some grass notes. Aftertaste was a bit bitter with a medium, almost a syrup texture, mouth feel."

"O - I would definitely call this a saison instead of a witbier...and an enjoyable one. I like the spicy ginger bite against the Sorachi Ace hops...complements well. Good citrusy character too. Body is a bit heavy for style, but works if you think saison. Glad to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting flavor, the ginger is only in a hint of spice, the lemon most overpowers with a hint of bitter bright hops on the back. Worth a try, but I would like to see this with thai basil."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is pretty decent for the style but nothin outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hmmm... this one's not bad, it just very enigmatic. I think the problem is that it's a little too dry and spiced without anything there to balance it. The lemon notes are present, but don't provoke much tartness or sweetness, and so the beer suffers as a result (because the yeast and the ginger sure as hell provide some dryness and spice). Okay... but not something I'd reach for regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent wit with a definite twist. The ginger certainly keeps the traditional citrus notes toned down while stubbornly giving way to the lemon notes from both the hops and lemongrass. Probably one of the more unique wits I've had, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just different"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer in a can! I really like this Westbrook offering! Great lawnmower beer for sure."
""
""
""
"O: A great (but odd) wheat beer. Extremely drinkable, I love the strange flavors from the ginger/lemongrass."
""
""
"Flavor is also tea like with a bit of spice to it, earthy hop bitterness is light. Again, more of a pale ale impression. Light bodied with ample carbonation, finishes dry and slightly bitter. Good flavor and session potential. Would like to try this fresh on tap in SC to compare someday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark for a witbier. Nose seems almost like...clay. Flavor is quite muddled. Not the light and airy, or bright, character that witbiers typically come off as. This is definitely much more earthy. Much more. Feel is smooth. Easy to drink, but not precisely a witbier, by old world standards. Still though, this style comes off as a disaster from so many other breweries. A well made attempt. I could be convinced to try this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very impressed. This competes favorably against the nice 750ml wheat beers on the market for a fraction of the cost. If you like your wheat beers fruit-forward, not too spicy, and silky smooth, I highly recommend you check this out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a golden body with good carbonation and head on top of an interesting aroma as the typical citric/lemonzest and spice one associates with a wit are replaced with ginger (and I guess Thai). Light, easy to drink, like most wits I've had but a little spicier and bitter, so to say, and has a crisp backbite. Enjoyable and an interesting take and while not my favorite I think it's a good beer."
""
""
""
"O - Looking for something to switch up the summer rotation? This is it."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a very interesting and nice witbier. No pepper, which is a big plus to me, and a lot of fruit and citrus. Worth checking out, would definitely pick it up sometime."

"Nice pour out of a can into my bhb tulip glass... white head... nice and cloudy yellow hazy just like a wit should be. Smell is of spices, clove, banana... everything I want in this style is in the nose hopefully it translates to the taste... don't really get the promised asian spices and flavors but damn a very drinkable hefe style beer... really wanted to get the promised ginger which hurts the rating only because I don't get it though I love the beer.."
""
""
"Not the biggest fan of the style but the text on the can sold me into giving it a shot. Well still not a fan of the style but this one grows on you . Solidly refreshing after a hot day in the yard and it is definitly a twist on the style and can see this as a summer staple in many a wit lovers fridge ."
""
"O-This beer would go great with some spicy Indian food or out on the beach. I'll definitely be picking it up again, it is a very unique style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent wit. I don't love the style, but its drinkable. Not sure I'd drink more than a taster, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is hazy and pale yellow with a soapy white head. The aroma brings earthy hops, floral notes, lemongrass. Some nice citrus and pepper in the flavor. Coriander and orange zest. Really drinkable. Complex and intriguing but also something you could gulp straight from the can on a spring day. Very nice."
""
" this beer does exactly what its meant to do quench your thirst and keeps you wanting another sip. pairs very well with food and great for sunny days by the pool"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice refreshing Wit that satisfies the palate. The salty tobacco profile is a winner for me. This is something I would drink all summer long."
"O: I found this beer to be easy to drink and fairly refreshing. I thought the southeast asian influence of the lemongrass and ginger was really nice."
"O- Subtle, interesting twist on Wit. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it does have that asian influence. A really good drinker, it has such delicate qualities."
"O: I enjoyed this beer because it was easy to drink and the taste—particularly the lemongrass—was very unique for the style."

"O: Nice, but not superb. The ginger is subtle, but nice."
"O: Overall, a pretty good beer. Witbier's are certainly not my favorite style, but I enjoy this brew. Id drink again, but I doubt its something Id go to often. Certainly not going to replace Westbrook IPA as a standard in my fridge."
""
""
""
"My first time trying this beer and I'm a huge fan. It goes over and above the run of the mill Witbier and adds depth of flavor, aroma, and a great feel. Can't wait to crack one of these on a hot summer day."

""
""
""

"Had a can while staying in Charleston. Holy cow! So delicious. On phone, so I'll keep it simple: smoothest, most balanced witbier I've ever had. Lost points for lacking spicyness they advertised. At 5% abv I could see myself drinking plenty of these."
""
""
""
""
"Not a ton of Thai flavor, but enough to make things interesting, and a solid wit base besides. Nice."
"Had to have a canned beer for a friend's boat and discovered this at Frugal McDougal's in Ft. Mill, SC. Excellent discovery! I recently took a cooler of it to a BBQ festival in Charlotte, NC and it was a big hit. I'm going to Charleston in early Dec. 2012 and have wife approval for a stop at the brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Served this Witbier on tap, at the brewery, in a pint glass. This Witbier poured a cloudy yellow color, produced a small white head, poor retention and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted wheat, spicy herbs and citric lemon. Light in body, a foundation of malted wheat, banana, lemongrass, spicy ginger and coriander- there was an evident tea like quality as well. This was an interesting take on a Witbier- Outside of the box ingredients used made for an interesting session beer. Nothing exceptional here, but defiantly worth a try!"
"O – Another tasty beer from Westbrook. I like their twist on the traditional witbier style. I think the ginger adds a great deal to the aroma and a nice little bite to the taste. A very drinkable beer. Don’t sleep on Westbrook. They don’t make bad beers."
"O: refreshing and good for style."
"As it turns out, I have a tulip glass from Belgian Independence Day (21 July 2012) which I got at the celebration at the Bronx Ale House. Hooray! I used the inverted Crack & Glug and ended up with over two fingers of dense, bone-white head with great retention. Color was a very cloudy lemon-yellow and it looked like a glassful of lemon meringue pie. Nose was zesty with the lemongrass and the ginger seemingly fighting for supremacy. Mouthfeel was soft, like it was caressing my tongue and the melding of the flavors was beautiful. Lemon, definitely, but as to what type of CANdy they were alluding to, I do not know, Lots of nice ginger spiciness also and I was beginning to mull over which dishes I would order at a BYOB with a sixer of this in tow. Finish was very dry and very refreshing. This is just what The CANQuest (TM) ordered!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very drinkable brew with a great finish and awesome flavor combinations, semi complex with a good bit of things happening in here!"
"A huge thanks to woodychandler for a great package, including this one. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of wheat, spice. Taste is lemons, wheat, a touch of ginger. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique and pretty good beer."
"O: Not really my favorite but not offensive. I can't really find anything wrong with it, just didn't do anything to excite me. That said, I have a few more in the fridge, so if a second impression changes my mind, I will update the review."
"This would do very well on a hot summer day in the Holy City of Charleston."
"M -Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Somewhat higher carbonation that I would like."
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic Witbier. It's original and refreshing. I'd love to pair this with Thai food. It's also a perfect summer porch-drinking candidate. I'm impressed with Westbrook after having their two year-round beers, and I wish I could try their more limited offerings."
"O - really suited for summer. Not a full bodied beer by any stretch but enjoyable. Perhaps not for the wit purist, but enjoyable and and fun to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tastes like a witbier cut with herbal tea, so a wit that's off the beaten path."
"Cost: $10.99 for a six pack of 12 oz cans."
""
""
"I am not a wit fan, but still enjoyed this one immensely. Great aromas of bannana and lemon. Taste is yeasty, and wheat, the lemony spicy taste really works. Sorachi hops was genius. Above average mouthfeel. Lacey. Excellent drinkability, lovely summer beer."
"Palate is interesting - quite tangy and lemony, full bodied and semi-sweet. Lemongrass comes through more on the palate and pairs well with the more subtle presence of ginger. The spices are thankfully not overdone, taking a backseat to the grainy wheat backbone and floral yeast character. Pretty unique stuff, very refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall: Looking around for a summer beer with a difference? Look no further than this gem, even if you aren't a big fan of Wits"
""
""
""
""
"o - one of the best wits i've ever had. only real fault is i wish the head had stayed around longer."
"Overall, this is an excellent, very refreshing beer that seems to stay very consistent."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a nice white head, that last for a little but slowly faded. I cant see through my glass. The smell is sweet and spicy, lemongrass, orange, and a hint of hops. It tastes awesome. It says it is brewed with Sorachi Ace Hops which come through just enough to give it a nice spice bitterness, and it has some ginger too. It is still very much a wheat beer but with these other flavors it pulls in some flavors similar to a Belgian style tripel. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with a good bit of carbonation."
""
"Lighter bodied, nice carbonation. A bit thin, a bit watery, but drinks easy. I imagine much more suited for warmer weather. I think the best way to sum it up is that this has much less of the characteristics I normall dislike about a Witbier."
"This beer was really surprising. I'm not usually a fan of the style but the bigger citrus notes really added something to this one. This would be a great beer for a hot summer day."
"D: I'm not a big fan of wits, but this is pretty tasty and refreshing. A nice little beer that I'd love to come back to when I'm in SC again over the summer."
""
""
"Overall - one of the best witbiers I've ever had. Absolutely great beer with such well measured spice flavor and a nice crisp finish. Altogether fantastic. Very well done and cheers to everyone at Westbrook Brewing Company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really cool beer. I think it has somewhat of a non-threatening, mass-market potential, even among non craft beer drinkers. But at the same time, I think people who enjoy and appreciate full-flavored beer will enjoy and appreciate this beer for what it is."
""
"The mouthfeel was light and very refreshing. On a warm Charleston evening, a very nice, tasty, refreshing spin on the tradition witbier."
"This is one of Westbrook's year-round offerings and it has turned into one of my favorites. It is extremely drinkable at 5% and is a beer that I never get tired of. I cannot wait for this to be canned so I can always have a supply in the beer fridge."
"Took a growler home from the brewery. Cracked it when it was a week old. Good head retention with an average golden hue. Aroma is nothing to speak of. Very little spiciness to it. Getting a bit of wit type yeast aroma, but very low on the lemony or ginger notes. Aroma is best described as flat. The beer is clean, actually a bit too clean with an unbalanced bitterness that just doesn't fit with a refreshing wit type brew. Swampy finish with a bit of muddled earthy ginger flavor. Overall not a favorite. If you're looking for a refreshing wit in charleston mothership from new belgium and allagash white are readiy available and preferable."
"Had this one with my dinner during my birthday dinner with a few friends. Served from tap into a nonic. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, floral notes, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, bread, floral notes, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had heard lots of people in the area talking badly about this beer, so I jumped at the chance to try it for myself. I found it quite enjoyable and easy drinking. It was pretty much spot on for what you would expect for the style with the addition of a few subtle spices to give it a little kick and stand out from the rest. A definite must try if you get the chance."
"Really enjoyed this beer. Excellent representation of the style and a perfect match for food. Seek this beer out when visiting Charleston in the summer."
"Had this at the brewery. Not up to all the hype that is around Chas. Average wit. Cant really taste the ginger or lemongrass. Try their IPA. Its the best one they have. Very thin beer. Seems to be common with their beers.Color was on par with a wit. Smell was also very weak"
"Overall this was solid. Not the greatest thing in the world, but I was really not complaining after I drank it. Would not mind trying again."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Smooth, refreshing."
"D: A good take on the witbier. Drinkable."
"D - Really good drinkability, the girlfriend and I had no problem killing the growler. I think with a couple of tweaks this could be a new favorite, I'd love to see the ginger and lemongrass ramped up to play a more prominent role, like the basil in the Bruery's Trade Winds Tripel. Still, very nice first offering."
"I really thought it was a cross between a Hefe and a witbier. I look forward to trying his other beers as I've tasted many of his homebrews and know how good of a brewer he is."
"The real bottom line is, White Thai is a better Witbier than some of the Big Dogs (Avery, Ommegang) and is brewed in my home state! I look forward to putting back a few dozen more of these and seeing how it evolves. Nice work, Westbrook."
