The beer was poured carefully into a tulip glass to avoid the settlement at the bottom of the bottle.  It was golden in color with foamy head that is not lacing.  The scent was chardonnay like with hints of orange spice.  The taste was much like a Belgian white.  The mouthfeel was light in body with good carbonation.  Overall its good and I'm glad to have tried it.","WoodBrew","Monday at 04:29 PM"

Flavors are there, the look is there, but it just didn't seem executed well. As stated before, maybe a bad batch, but it was incredibly bitter up front which kind of took away from some of the flavors. I am more of a complex beer appreciator so this one might be a little bit light for my style. That being said I have tried others of a similar style and enjoyed them quite a bit.","Jaysauras","Mar 20, 2015"

3.8,-2.3,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Picked up a single fresh bottle at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC. After scoring the tin foil cap and popping the top, I proceeded to pour the dirty blonde ale in to a tall wit tulip. Exceptionally cloudy with tons of unfiltered particulates floating freely. The drink dons a  3-finger frothy foam head of fine bubbles. Most of the foam dissipated fairly quickly, but it left a nice thin layer that endured. Decent retention with no lacing. Lots of coriander in the nose, with a citrusy orange zest. Faint grassy, wooden aroma in the background. The first sip brings a distinct lemon sourness, tart, with grains of wheat in the finish. Nearly undetectable clove spice. Simple. Aside from the coriander and citrus, the beer is lacking complexity. Mostly due to the sparing use of competing spices. Ultimately I think that adds to the charm of this one. The carbonation is lively and the body is somewhat thin. Refreshing. This beer immediately makes me think of summer time. With it's fresh lemon citrus flare and easy drinkability this beer is the perfect companion for a hot sunny day. While not the best wit I've had, I'll take this over any number of the crappy shandy varieties I've sampled.","JohnnyI","Jan 12, 2015"

This is an extremely drinkable brew - I can picture it fitting with a wide variety of foods and settings. The lovely fruit flavours - apricot, organge and bit of lemon give Blanche de Chambly a tasty, but not cloying overall sweetness. C'est fantastique!","Bunman3","Dec 23, 2014"
4.38,12.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer has exceeded my expectations and I would definatley recommend for any fellow beer drinker.  It has a smoothness comparable to the greats and it goes down quite easily.  It is a full beer that has a lasting flavor.  The only annoying part is peeling the tin-foil off to get at the beer, but after that its all flavor.  I am not a big fan of white ale's but as for as they go this one is at the top.  I would even consider drinking it on a regular basis.  This is my 3rd beer rating so I could have my beer goggles on, however i feel even at this inebriated state i am capable of judging accurately.  Before I thought the french were snobby jerks but now I am starting to like them.","Jonathan33373","Dec 21, 2014"

So you can say it is not at par with other Unibroue brews (ps. Expectation is a bitch), but why not have a refreshing faithful to style wit? Lastly I noticed that when it warms up, changes completely and becomes more complex and robust. Which is common, but here it is more delayed than usual.

It was faint to begin with then it gained some tart citrus, apple and a spice. The yeast wasn't that funky on the nose and the malt was a light sweetness. There was a nice fresh orange peel and wheat. The whisper of banana and clove and maybe some coriander. As it warmed it developed a stone fruit juicy scent that was very enticing. Taste is bland and a bit plain. The malt was a light cracker on the palate. The tart citrus was very strong. The spice competed for the palate and won out over any sweet fruit. The wheat imparted dryness and it was as dry as champagne. I liked that. It lacked flavor. The banana could have been more prominent and imparted a creaminess to the flavor. The clove could have added depth. The carbonation is the lions share of the mouthfeel and except for it this beer is thin.","utopiajane","Oct 17, 2013"

The smell is pretty standard for a wit, it also has the typical Unibroue yeasty tang in there as well. Orange, banana, coriander and wheat bread round it out. Overall it may be a bit on the weak side. The taste is clean with this one with the wheat providing a solid base and the majority of the taste profile in general. Also in there are hints of spice, yeast esters and citrus. High levels of carbonation make this quite tingly, the finish is pretty clean and dry while the bitterness to sweetness ratio is fairly neutral with little of both. Overall it is another good offering from this brewery, maybe not their best but it is a good example of the style and one that I wouldn't mind having again.","fank2788","Oct 12, 2013"

An aggressive pour might leave cakes of yeast swimming in your glass, but it makes little sense to pour this beer like a sissy. You want the froth effect, trust me. Aroma is bready malt, apples, citrus, spice, a touch of herbs. Palate is a bouquet of the expected coriander, citrus pith and fruit (orange, lemon, a bit of tropical pineapple which combines with a creamy mouth feel to produce a pina colada effect), and a subtle apple cinnamon spice. Refreshing but not boring, finish is sweet and herbal, with a lingering yeasty sweetness almost like caramel corn. Almost no detectable alcohol or technical flaws I can pick out. Carbonation is lively and right where it needs to be to lift the fruit and spice. An archetypal Belgian witbier and I echo the other reviewers who feel this is the standard to which others should be compared.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 07, 2013"

This was one of the first Unibroue beers I picked up and one I would recommend to anyone. It's a good representation of the Belgian witbier style and probably the best coming from North America. Canadian craft breweries are often overlooked, but without question Unibroue is one that are excellent at what they do. Blanche De Chambly is a very good beer in an often under done style considering its Belgian. This is a worthy ale in the warm months and fairly easy to require anywhere. It's worth the purchase for anyone who appreciates class beer.","BradtheGreat7","Jan 16, 2013"

Poured into a glass mug, slowly and surely, shook the remaining 3/4 and added all yeast and sediment into the glass. Frothy, milky head that stayed all the way throughout the drinking of this dynamite beer. Smells of fresh oranges, coriander and I get a hint of the sweet Belgian yeast as well. Lacing is super intense, almost looks like I bathed this one in a bubble bath. I would say that this is one of those beers that you should point someone to who is looking for accurate depictions on the Belgian wit style. The BJCP folks out there should study this one and disregard lesser versions like Hoegaarden that, while good, just don't stand out like this great Quebec brew.

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like wheat, lemon peel, coriander, and some cloves. It tastes like wheat, lemon and orange peel, coriander, apricots, and a bit of peppery spice. The finish is sweet and fruity. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and refreshing and is also well carbonated. It would be even better on a hot day instead of on a kinda cold January day!

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/20/2013. Pours very hazy golden straw color with a nice fluffy 2-3 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, light banana, earth, herbal, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity and strength; very pleasant. Taste of lemon, orange zest, wheat, coriander, pepper, clove, light banana, earth, herbal, bread, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, pepper, clove, wheat, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice amount of flavor with good balance and complexity. Fairly high carbonation and medium body; with a very crisp and slightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian Witbier! Very nice flavor complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Aug 25, 2012"

4.14,6.4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I poured this into a goblet and noticed the thick head that formed and the golden straw color of the ale. On the nose this beer is very fruity/citrus-like in aroma which is to be expected of a beer of this style, but it had a crispness to it that was most appealing. On the first taste it was again what one would expect from a witbier..citrusy..especially to me a tangrine-like essence that was most refreshing. This beer is smooth, velvety smooth likely due to the 5% ABV, but I think also to the excellence of the brewing...just very well crafted. The best of the Unibroue range....perhaps not, but it is still an excellent brew that anyone would enjoy on a warm late spring day. As a session beer this would be one of my top choices..easy drinking, full of flavor, and high enough of an abv to have character but not so high as to be obnoxious after a few glasses.","ghampton106","Mar 01, 2012"

Light coriander, lemon and a touch of orange on the nose. Also a bit of soft wheat in the background. Lighter on the palate than many Witbiers I have had, but it has a nice dry finish and a bit of spice, more of a lemon finish for me than orange peel. Mouthfeel is pretty light but it has a beautiful fine carbonation that only comes from bottle conditioning. Overall this is a really nice beer, for me I tend to like a little richer and bigger Wit (something like St. Bernardus which is one of my favorites) but does not mean that the lightness is a fault in this beer.

3.49,-10.3,3.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Overall: Maybe it's all the imperial stouts that I've been having lately or something. This one just didn't seem to be the same beer that I remembered from trying before. Still very drinkable, but more in a Bud Light Golden Wheat than a Hoegaarden kind of way. The smell is still fantastic, but the flavor profile came across as watery. Definitely one for the summer, and one that I'll have again.","mdvatab","Jun 07, 2011"
3.65,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out as a nice looking hazy golden color. The head was pretty big with a nice white sticky lacing.

Overall this beer is quite enjoyable.","Knapp85","Jun 07, 2011"

4.23,8.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I'm enjoying my trip down Unibroue memory lane, and hopefully this stop won't be the start of any disappointment. It pours a hazy golden orange topped by plenty of white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, light lemon zest, coriander, light black pepper, and a light twinge of what seems like green apple. The taste holds notes of wheat, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, nutmeg, and, again, a very light prick of green apple. The spicy notes really set this brew apart from its wit compatriots. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very enjoyable wit from those masters of brewing from the Great White North.","TMoney2591","May 27, 2011"

3.5,-10,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Blanche De Chambly was a pale white-yellow color and hazy. It had a white head with decent retention and minimal lacing. The smell was yeast, spice and a bit fruity. The taste was yeast and light malt upfront with some peppery spice coming through towards the finish. The finish was dry and peppery. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium-high carbonation. Overall it is an above average Witbier, but not one that I am likely to go back to.","afinepilsner","May 13, 2011"

Smells like a very sweet beer, smells like a lot of fruit. Tastes very watery and there isn't any of the sweetness I expected. The finish is smooth and leaves your mouth feeling quenched.

With this unique flavor, I would not mind having another.","beerprovedwright","Feb 19, 2011"
3.67,-5.7,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass per the labels instructions. The beer pours a hazy and bubbly straw-gold coloring with a thin, white, airy head that recedes after a few minutes. Aromas of slight citrus, wheat/grain/cereal, and earthy notes. The beer has a spiced sweetness to it, mostly coriander, but also some hints of cinnamon. The spices do well riding the light and crisp body and the mellow malty flavors. The beer has a spiced aftertaste, with a smooth and clean finish. There is a slight linger to the finish with hints of the spices and sour tinge, but very mild. This beer is very light in body, and surprisingly the flavors are a bit on the light side, as well.","GarthDanielson","Feb 17, 2011"

It is not as cloudy as I expected for a bottle fermented ale. The aroma espouses a little wheat, spice, and thin hops. Subtle is the catch phrase for that. The wheat is not as prevalent in the taste as I would expect but it is offset nicely with a tart citrus element and a little hops at the end.","puboflyons","Sep 19, 2010"

It smells like a field in the best way possible...lots of banana and yeast aromas. The taste was great. It wasn't a sensory overload of flavors like coriander or lemon/orange peel.

The yeast held in suspension gives this beer a bit of body, the carbonation stops it from feeling too heavy. It's got a bit of substance without being filling.

The usual spiciness (corinder, orange) are more subdued than I've experienced in the style. Smooth and balanced with just a little tang on the finish. The body is right where it should be, light while full. Wonderfully drinkable, I can see drinking many of these during coming summer. This style is one of my warm weather favorites, and I find this to be an excellent example of the style. After finishing the first glass, I swirled the yeast up off the bottom of the bottle.

Light to medium-bodied, possesses enough sourness in the lemon, orange citrus as well as heaviness in the clove, coriander spices to be fully light-bodied and nimble.

Starts sweet on the palate and then becomes a little sour as the hops sink in. Light to medium body, high carbonation, crisp finish. Refreshing.

Billowing bright white, rocky head could barely be contained in the glass before finally settling into a solid half-inch cap. Some bands of lacing, but poor adhesion. Scent of lemonzest and corriander. Taste follows nose, but flavors are less pronounced than the aroma suggested; addition of wheat also present in the mouth. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and somewhat flat tasting considering the dense cap, with a clean finish. Easy drinking brew, but I've had more flavorful wits.

Smell is very juicy, with citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons....and also some mango and pineapple. Taste is similar to a lemon pie, the pie crust is especially apparent. Great dose of carbonation on a light body. Drinkability is also very high. Easily one of the best Wits I have had in a while.

This one pours with the typical voluminous foam of a Unibroue beer, but the foam slowly subsides, leaving a white, rocky head. The nose is peppery and more generally spicy. Bitterness is kept very low leaving just a bread-like malt character and spicy esters behind. There are hints of phenols, but the finish is quite clean. I top up my glass, adding some of the yeast at the bottom of the bottle, which seems to add a touch more complexity and slightly more spice in the finish. Blanche de Chambly seems to have more body than the last witbier I tasted, which was Hoegaarden.

Nose is somewhat lacking. Flavor is a bit light as well. The citrus flavors of a good Wit are there, just not quite pronounced enough. Once again, the lemon tartness,orange,yeast flavors are there. The mouthfeel is quite light, not as creamy as I prefer my Wits to be. The beer simply is too carbonated for my preference.

It reminded me of a blend of a Belgian, mixed with a wheat flavor to it. While this beer is brewed in Quebec it was rather a plesant drink. Nothing against Quebec, I just have not had total pleasure drinking La fin du monde, so I was a little skeptical drinking this one.","skeetermoses","Oct 28, 2007"

3.69,-5.1,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a bright golden orange color with a decent white head that dissipated into a white ring around the glass. The smell is quite good: Belgian yeast funk, candi sugar, orange peel and coriander. It has more of the Belgian yeast aroma than most wit brews. The taste is of orange peel, coriander, apple juice and light candi sugar. Not as heavy on the orange peel and coriander as most wits; which I find to be a good thing. The feel is light and way over-carbonated. The carbonation takes away much of the flavor. It kind of paralyzes the tongue. Not as strong in the witbier taste as others, probably due to the carbonation but it is still a good brew.","Gmann","Oct 16, 2007"

Smell reveals a clovey sweet witbier smell. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and leaves it hard to taste. What I got was a very light, highly carbonated witbier. The best flavor of witbier I have had in a while. Mouthfeel was overpoweringly carbonated, but nothing a quick swirl can't overcome a little bit of. Wow, still very carbonated like a fresh lemon-lime soda. Overall I did enjoy this very much, once you get past the soda pop mouthfeel it's pretty darn good.

The smell reminds me more of a saison than a witbier. Taste reveals a very refreshing lemon and grapefruit/orange peel flavors with hints of pepper and coriander. The mouthfeel is extremely light and thin, which is often the case with such a beer, although this borders on being too thin. Very crisp and refreshing finishing dry. Highly drinkable and enjoyable summer brew. I tried half the beer without the yeast and half with. I often enjoy the yeast and found this improved the beer.","Jmamay22","Aug 07, 2007"

Taste is a bit biter tartness that is not over bearing but does go down nice and smooth, with a hint of peppery finish, this I enjoyed after i finished cutting my lawn and boy was it very refreshing.

I think most beers taste better with the sediment in them (IMO) but especially this one. Now it is a cloudy yellow, nice on the eyes. Smells of delicate citrus, fruits, and the spicy Unibroue yeast is just noticeable. The taste is a clean citrusy followed by a slightly spicy yeasty finish.

Pale malt, candy sugar, and peach shnapps aromas, mabye some spices in the background. Two-row sweetness and strong steel-cut oats flavor upfront, followed by snappy Wit yeast phenols, mild coriander, and a dash of clove. Dry aftertaste, only the spices and some mellow peach esters hang around - briefly. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, a very crisp beer with the spices completing a good balance in the absence of any hop character. The flash of fruit and spice mingle with the sweet malt and ester before quickly vanishing, and this sensation remains consistent to the finish with no residual or lingering flavors. A light and effervscent ale with many intracacies but modest in girth; a nice session beer or summertime quaffer.","PBRstreetgang","Jul 05, 2007"

Mouthfeel is okay; carbonation is a bit much in my opinion. Drinks easily, but not really hitting me with enough to get too excited.

The taste is light and refreshing, like a sparkling wine. Afficionados with a more sophisticated palate toward fine wines than mine will undoubtedly enjoy the delicate nature of this beer. Mouthfeel is light - similar to that of a mass produced pilsner. This beer however is clearly light years more complex than a Miller or Budweiser. It is difficult for me to judge this style as it is not one that I'm familiar with, but I can imagine that it rates well with devotees of witbiers. Blanche De Chambly pairs well with the slice of Veggie Pizza that I'm having for lunch. Very drinkable. Give it a try!

The smell is sweet, lemony, maybe some coriander. The taste is light, light, light. It's a refreshing beer, a bit watered down, no hop taste at all, plenty of citrus and lemony overtones, maybe some oranges. It's on the dry side, and it just reminds me too much of sunflowers in summer. There is no after taste, and what taste there is is purely in the middle and dissipates towards the end. This is an interesting beer, well made, refreshing, clean, but just too transparent for my tastes. I can see this being enjoyed too easily by those who don't appreciate beer (the wine cooler crowd), as much as it being appreciated by those who do.

Citrus notes start with a soft lemon and develops into some orange and faint lime tones and ranges from pithy bitter to juicy pulp. Light coriander rounds out this delicate beer. The finish is herbal with some dryness and something a little minerally. High carbonation at the beginning but actually settles down in the mouth to give it creamy mouthfeel.

There is a big wheat flavor that is almost nutty, a substantial coriander/white pepper quality, faint clove, mild hop bitterness but almost no hop flavor, and a spiciness that isn't as pronounced as I'd like.

Aroma of light clove and bitter orange. The taste is of soft wheat, with the spices coming through on the finish. The mouthfeel is soft and light. This beer is a real quaffer; you can down two before you even notice it.

3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Slightly hazy, pale gold in hue with honey-peachy highlights. Not much in the way of animation reached the head, this didnt seem to matter much as the head reached a healthy three fingers in height. Bright white in color, for some reason I felt compelled to listen to my beer. As the head rapidly faded away it was crackling and popping. It was quite loud! This noisy chaos almost compensated for the rapid head depletion. Almost. There was no subsequent lacing. This is a respectable looking beer. The nose has all of the classic Wit characteristics but this offering seems to have one extra thing going for it. It smells fresher, lively. Pleasant. I enjoy the aromas of dried oranges, spice like coriander and maybe a whiff of ginger, wheat, vanilla, faint leather, and at the end is a hint of candied malt. The potency is small and all of the previously mentioned smells are light on the nose, this seems typical for the style so I will have to live with that. No complaints really, the bouquet is classy and inviting. I look forward to a sip. The palate is lovely; I dont think Unibroune breaks any new ground with this one though. Maybe they werent trying too. As there is nothing wrong with being dead-on for the style. I really enjoy the spirited carbonation (at the beginning), there was a million miniature bubbles dancing on my tongue. That is definitely one way to make a beer refreshing. The flavors consist of sweet maltiness, apples, vanilla, spice (coriander and I swear ginger yeasty can be tricky!), and some raw wheat flavors. I really enjoy the softness of the palate, obviously well-crafted. Once the aftertaste develops a citrus bite is found along with the flavors I mentioned earlier. It is enjoyable but not boisterous. Medium/medium-light in body, it seems a tickle thin, also the carbonation falls apart too quickly. Overall the mouthfeel is satisfying but not really that noteworthy. This is a good drinker, plus the abv is only 5%! I could kick back and enjoy a few 750ML bottles on some lazy Saturday afternoon. Of course that is predicated on me finding this beer again. Sure, there are a million reviews for it on BA but Ive never seen it in Kansas City (it sure the hell is not in Nebraska). I purchased my bottle in Burnsville, MN for $7.00. I like it.","bditty187","Sep 02, 2004"

Rather tame aromawise, with musty, mildly bready yeast tones and floral honey tones dominating. Understated orange peel character. In flavor, prevalent is an herbaceous impression of coriander and grainy, tart wheat. Notions of bitter lemon peel with a trace pith like astringency provide a drying bitterness. Dulcet cloveish phenols and trace banana esters arise as the beer warms and complement sourdough tones. Lightly bodied with a token proteinaceous viscosity from the wheat, but otherwise nearly thin. Finishes with benign citric bitterness along with an too fleeting snap of bright, ripe orange. A well rounded, albeit prosaic wit. Crafted well, but perhaps the most underwhelming of Unibroue's classic interpretations.","marc77","Aug 03, 2004"

The smell is of light citrus. The malt flavor is average, nothing offensive, same can be said for the yeast. The alcohol flavor is light as well. The flavor overall is light, with hints of clove lemon and honey. the mouth feel is light, and crisp. The body feels light and fizzy as well. This beer is good for any occasion, I don’t think this beer can do any wrong. Although if you do want to ""kick it up a notch", try unibroue's La Fin Du Monde.

The color, that perfect, nearly translucent, pale, hazy golden-almost pastel (if golden could be pastel) that just begs one to the well. The nose while a little muted offers just enough anteseptic spice especially clove. On the palate the beer acts like a sorbet, cleansing the palate and inviting another gulp or perhaps the next course. I like to drink this at a restaurant bar to get my appetite going for the good food to come. This is a clean as a whistle wheat that is tough to beat.

This is a highly drinkable beer, and a beautiful sight to behold, a glimmering golden cloud when held in the light. A very yeasty beer... especially the dregs of the cask! As far as wheat beers go, I would definitely take an Alagash White or a Hoe over this stuff. Just not as exciting as I'd hoped it would be. The taste was citric, but kind of boring. It had a bit of a novelty appeal, coming in a cask, but if I had it to do all over again I'd probably just spend my money on a few big bottles of Fin du Monde, which is a better beer for its style.","Marty","Mar 25, 2003"

Well, in comparison the 12 oz bottle this one appears a deeper golden haze with same yellow frothing head. Leaves a collar of lace around the head, but no lace is forming evenly througout the glass. The aroma is full of spices, banana, and a slightly citrus tone is also present very pleasant. The flavor is wheat based with many complements tantalizing the taste buds at the same time, such as a bubbly sharp sweetness of citrus mellowed by spices and a banana flavor created by the yeast. The mouthfeel is pretty much similar to some seltzer water with the high carbonation, but after having this mussels steamed in this the other night at Smokeless Joe's I can't get enough of it. Overall very drinkable beer that sits up there with the best witbier in the world my Hoegaarden.

The mouth feel was nice and full for this light style and drinkability is fantastic. Get me going with these on a hot summer day at a cook out and you might have to wheel me home.

This one is clearly not past it's prime. Nice hop inspired citrus smell. Taste follows, very tart, puckering snap to it. Subtle spices. Creamy sweet malt in the middle. Full bodied for such a crisp refreshing beer. Only the slightest trace of tart fruit taste lingers. Very good, way up on my list as a summer refresher.

Pepper, clove, and raisin to be exact. As for the palate, it's surprising that this beer is so flavorful, having such a light body. The spicy products of the yeast, pepper and clove, are dominant. Dried fruit is underneath. Malt is present, but quite subtle. Hops are more noticeable and add a bit to the spiciness. Just a few banana esters in there. Very well done beer. Perfection for a wit.

4.38,12.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a hazy lemon yellow, with coarse white foam that disapates almost immediatley. The smell of spices and citrus is a clean plaeasant aroma. The taste of cloves is what I first picked up. A very pleasant and interesting flavor, along with a touch of citrus. Almost a champain style, but beer instead.","BeerManDan","May 23, 2002"
4.03,3.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Part of the yeast was spilled into this sample ... it really added an other complexity to this brew. Not a bad White Ale to be had here, definitely closer to a Belgian White Ale than most American breweries have come. 5% abv.","Jason","May 22, 2002"
4.15,6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The first Belgian Wit that I have tried. The flavor is very refreshing, the ABV is low for an offering from unibroue. I could down several 750ml bottles.","weissbierhead","May 20, 2002"

2.47,-36.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"A way below average Belgian Wit style beer, no head retention whatsiever, a bit cloying and sticky, you'd expect more from Unibroue.","rastaman","Apr 05, 2002"
3.87,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a cloudy off-white, with an average sized white fluffy head. The flavor though not overwhelming is very balanced with moderate levels of sweetness and acidity with a hint of bitterness. The finish is quick and clean. Overall a very refreshing and interesting brew that I enjoyed. I dont know if it was the food that I was eating at the time, but I prefer (just by a little) a Hoegaarden over the Blanche De Chambly, but still a good White.","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 02, 2002"
4.25,9.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Just a step down from Allagash as far as North American Wit's go.  Unibroue proves once again that it can do no wrong","cokes","Mar 26, 2002"
4.68,20.3,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"WOW, Head like a fluffy white cloud, sticks to your lips like marshmellow fluff.  Bubbles engulf your tongue as the brew wantingly slides down.  Awesome white beer.  The wife loves it (who never likes MY BEER).  It is the champagne of beers. 5% ABV","frank4sail","Mar 26, 2002"
4.66,19.8,5,4,5,4,5,"An awesome white. It's hard to find flaw with any of Unibroue's beers.","John","Oct 25, 2001"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A very interesting white, not as spiced as some, and not as malty as most.  As I drank it, I kept wondering what it was that this sort of reminded me of.  Finally I was able to put my finger on it - a spumante champagne.","Brent","Aug 24, 2001"
