4.76,36.4,4.25,4.5,5,4.75,4.75,"Poured from the bottle and loved this beer. As a Witbier style it was well executed with a fair amount of alcohol. Somewhat creamy notes of coriander and spice are tasted but most prevalent was the orange flavor. When drinking this beer with a friend we joked of it tasting like orange juice. And that's not a bad thing in my opinion. I don't recall the age of the beer but it was certainly delicious. Bold flavor paired with an excellent execution makes a very good beer. Highly recommended.","barfootbandit","Jan 29, 2015"

It pours a nice orange, but the head is not impressive and quickly dissipates. The aroma is a bit weak with mostly honey and faint hints of citrus. The taste follows the aroma, but I think the honey sweetness is a bit overpowering. Overall the beer is not bad, but not great; however, I would drink it again.

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready/honey malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength.

Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, lemon zest, pear, light banana, wheat, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of spice, yeast ester, and bready/honey malt sweetness; with decent complexity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

Dark yellow to a shade before orange in the glass, would likely be clearer were it not for the spice particulate floating around, plenty of bubbles, larger and with good vigor. The nose on the whole is quiet so it does not take much for the orange zest to take a leading position, there's a sweet spice presence as well as a pinch of pepper however both fade into the fabric, the wheat notes stick in your mind via power of suggestion, turns more floral as it warms, decent peach to apricot fruit as well, the malts likewise folded into the whole. Medium-bodied, the carbonation gives it good posture and increases overall mouth presence, Firmness tends to carry it beyond simple quaffing wit, this may be for the better or worse depending on your expectations. The orange infusion does well in not overplaying its hand, same for the coriander, anise seed type spices. The honey too brings needed sweetness but within a thought out framework. The malts tastes like malt as in malted milk balls. More quinine than wheat, grain or yeast flavors, not herbaceously bitter.

2.96,-15.2,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, orange juice, with a wheat note note and spices. In the taste, dry wheat notes and a small spice, like pepper, with a orange juice like citrus flavor. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with dry wheat hints. OJ stands out, nice wheat notes and dry spice.","OWSLEY069","Sep 29, 2010"

4.32,23.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - Overall I didn't fall in love with the beer but was glad to try something new. It had the flavor and even seemed to balance the higher ABV since most Witbier's I had are around 4.4 - 4.9 it worked rather well. I may just try more from this brewery very good brew.","DrDemento456","Aug 22, 2010"
3.5,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy light orange with a small friendly white head, which falls away far too quickly. The aroma is tangy and spicy, with light clove, orange zest, and a hop zing. The flavor is orangy and spicy, with clove and allspice, and there is a good hop bitterness on the back end, but in between there is a watery thinness. This is the sweet spot that cries out for a little more something in this beer. The mouthfeel is a little prickly.","Seanibus","Aug 21, 2010"

2.91,-16.6,4,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Pours a hazy gold color with a thin eggshell head that retains OK. The aroma has some spices upfront (corriander, clove, orange peel) along with a little biscuit, bandaid, wax and some fruitiness. The flavor is similar to the aroma with spices upfront, along with a little hay, some orange and lemon, wax, bandaid and funk and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and drinkability is OK. This is a decent wit but it's astringent and has a weird bandaid flavor/aroma that is offputting.","silver0rlead","Beers"

3.62,3.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall a very quaffable beer. A nice west-coast adaptation of a classic Belgian style, though I might have called it "wheat" rather than "wit," as color and spice profile are significantly different from witbier. I would recommend giving it a try.","oldhippie247","Apr 28, 2010"
3.56,2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"F: Some bitterness, mostly orange peel and spices for the bitterness, with lingering, yep, orange peel and spices. Some wheat flavors, tangy orange lingering, coriander and spices lingering too. Weird bitterness just lingers, like I just bit on an orange peel.","jlindros","Apr 25, 2010"
4.02,15.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: Overall, it was a good beer with a nice balance of citrus and sweetness. It's not really my type of beer, but for its style, it was enjoyable. A good change of pace, though.","bgildea","Apr 18, 2010"
