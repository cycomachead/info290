The bread adds a nice texture to it that might be what makes it go down so smooth. Either the lights have dimmed or this has beer has become a bit more hazy in appearance. Still would love to have another. Not sure what the grains are, but sensing a presence of wheat (thus the haze), and maybe a light biscuit flavored variety. Good stuff !","Curtis","Aug 07, 2014"

Hoegaarden and Blue Moon are two great examples of what I look for in a Belgian White/Wheat aka Witbier style and in my opinion this brewery's take on it is less than satisfactory. There are worse beers out there but I think for a Belgian White this one has been the worst so far.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 03, 2014"

Quite nice, again true to style, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Quite easy to drink. A good, but not spectacular, example of a witbier.

Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers for a bit. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of pear, coriander, orange peel, wheat, light pepper, light clove, floral, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with decent balance and complexity; but there is not much going on here other than the spicing. Taste of pear, coriander, orange peel, wheat, pepper, light clove, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruit, coriander, orange peel, wheat, pepper, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of spice/malty flavors, without feeling watery; and no cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a solid witbier. Solid balance of flavors and easy to drink; just really not all that exciting. Enjoyable stuff.","superspak","May 05, 2013"

But either way, very little spice in this and VERY little wheat. There isn't much I hate more than a small amount of wheat in a beer. It honestly just felt like a watered down beer to me. I could tell they obviously didn't water down the beer to save money, that would have tasted terrible, but i just got that feeling, not much taste, not much anything.

The tight head fades in fairly short order to a thin rim. Smells of coriander and dusky bitter orange with some wheat notes in the background. The taste is similar, with a peculiar herbal bitterness which is not from hops. The bitter orange lingers as well and makes it quite citrusy in that dried peel kind of way. I'd say there is simply too much coriander and orange here and it kind of makes the beer out of whack. It also lacks that zingy crispness that makes the style so pleasant and thirst quenching.

Medium golden blond, with a bit of white foam that dissipates fairly quickly. On the nose I get some Belgian yeast, banana, some wheat and a little peppery spice. Very fruity on the palate, a little lemon, some apricot and maybe pear/apple. Very dissimilar to most whites I've had, but refreshing and flavorful.","emmasdad","May 25, 2010"
2.74,-20.3,2,3,3,3,2,"M/D: light feel with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is ok but the taste seems off for a witbier and seemed harsh.","Kemmerlin","May 22, 2010"
3.36,-2.3,2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I wasn't going into this with high expectations, but I was pretty impressed. The appearance is a clear-golden with a big head that disappears fast. I smell spices and some peppery notes. Slight sweetness on the nose as well. Interesting taste to this wheat beer. The wheat hits you in the face right away. This beer blows Blue Moon outta the water. Lot's of spice and very little hops, with a nice aftertaste. I would definitely buy this again as a 6 pack for a nice summer BBQ session beer.","DovaliHops","May 09, 2010"
3.15,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Taste sweetens as it warms and holds a firm spiced character, revealing a bit of citrus amongst a dense wheat feel. And while the wheat is detected in the feel it is a bit difficult to discern in flavor. A unique brew that is dry in a spice sense yet without being bitter, and offers a flash of citrus on the finish. I'm not quite sold on it however, as I find it too chalky in structure and with subtle wheat notes overwhelmed.","HalfFull","May 04, 2010"

I have also recently tried other whites and hoped this would be the sleeper and slot in maybe 2nd place. However, I did not like the taste it had and that is a deal killer despite the nice smell and agreeable mouthfeel.","NA1NSXR","Mar 23, 2010"
3.7,7.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a middle-of-the road wit that while drinkable just doesn't stand out. Mild recommend if you can easily get. Rotation - not avail here in TX so shipped to myself from CO. If here, maybe the occasional 6 pack in my wit rotation. For now, not worth shipping more but would try on-tap at least once while on the road. [O;O]","TexIndy","Mar 07, 2010"
2.96,-14,4,3,2.5,4,3,"Appearance has a nice golden color with a lot of carbonation bubbling up feeding a crisp white head. Smell of wheat and light spice and faint citrus. Taste has a light sweet spiced wheat flavor. Mouthfeel is light - medium with good carbonation. A drinkable brew, but one I won't pay for again in awhile.","Bookseeb","Feb 21, 2010"
2.9,-15.7,3,3,3,2,3,"I think this brew leaves a lot to be desired. Some more intense spicing, lighter carbonation, a heavier body, and a less filtered appearance would be required for the Alaskan White to stack up to its competition. I'm certainly fortunate to have been able to sample an Alaskan Brewing Co. beer (considering it isn't readily available out this way) but this one needs a little work.","turnstile","Jan 29, 2010"

3.33,-3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Light golden body, a bit of chill haze, cleared up for the most part as it warmed. 1 finger white head, medium dissipation, with nice lacing. The nose is citrusy, the orange peel with a bit of lemon (Meyer lemon?) some spice notes, coriander with a bit of white pepper. The taste is, unfortunately, off, citrus prominent but overwhelmed by coriander, worse yet is this aggressive banana taste-is this a bad keg, big diacytel hit-ugh. A bit of hoppiness on the back end. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. This would certainly be tres drinkable on a hot summer day, wonder what this is doing being served in winter time. OK, but not in the league of Allagash or Hoegaarden.","jdense","Jan 19, 2010"

The smell of spice and mild hops had a pleasant aroma. The taste was of spices, mild hops and a hint of malts and yeast, as in bread taste. A very nicely balance of components, without the bittness.

3.48,1.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"If you really like Belgian Wits this should appeal to you. Having said that, this is actually pretty lackluster within the style.

3.35,-2.6,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is dry, carbonated, and astringent. The body of the beer is light, and the finish is medium.

3.95,14.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Alaskan Brewing does a good job with this style. Not an easy one to nail down, this beer gets the delicate spices right. Corriander and Curraco orange peel set the stage for a silky and spicy beer. Set atop a firm malt base of wheat and pilsner malts, the yeasty phenols swirl around the peppery corriander and citrusy orange peel notes. At times the spices seem to dominated with a shakey wheat character. Wheat malts seem to give away some body and allow the acidity and minerally character to compromise the mouthfeel. The winter wheat and oat additions common to Belgian varieties don't seem to make the impact here that is needed. Still, a quality beer to enjoy during those hot Alaskan days (wait, what?). Thanks Clvand0!","BEERchitect","Jun 15, 2009"
