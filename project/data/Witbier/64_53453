If you want a good Wit to  enjoy, buy it. If you're looking for a complex and a beer with bursting flavors, don't buy a case of this...Just a six pack to expierence it lol.","dodge408","Dec 25, 2014"

I’m not getting much on the aroma either: almost smells like a grape must, though maybe just because now I have white wine on the mind. I suppose it’s probably the subtle lemongrass that I’m picking up with some of the body of the peppercorn, but not the edge. Again, not getting any of the advertised orange, but more a muted grassy fruit twinge, again likely the lemongrass taking the forefront. Don’t notice any pepper dash here, and only a vague bready note in the distance and a faint Belgian yeast at the finish, but that’s about it. Some might describe it as subtle, I am more inclined to be a little less forgiving and just say there’s not really that much going on. Surprisingly decent medium body, and a bit of a dry finish. I mean... it IS a beautiful sunny afternoon, which really seems to be the perfect venue for this beer. Though I feel like I should be in an airy white tent with cucumber sandwiches. Nope, just covered in insulation and watching the forest...","kemoarps","Aug 24, 2014"

Delicate summer-like flavors infused with the wonderful touch of lemongrass makes this a perfect mid-afternoon beverage. I was, however, fairly disappointed with the mouthfeel, which is rare for me to say about a Dogfish Head offering. I'm hoping it was just a fluke, but it's not enough for me to shy away from recommending this Wit to others. A fine example of a fine style.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 19, 2014"

Taste has a light malt sweetness up front going into a tangy citrus with a bit of a bite. A little spice but the wheat remains the dominant flavor. Rather full bodied for a wit but not heavy.

It's not too overbearing, but compared to most white beers, it's just different; however, different isn't always bad. As a pleasant surprise, the herbal esters of this beer definitely sneak up on you. They are barely detectable in the aromas, but this adds to the overall experience of this beer. This beer is a welcome (if not unusual) surprise from Dogfish Head. Not necessarily a brew that I'd keep stock of, I would definitely pick up a bottle or two again to have some variety.","MattNidiffer","Apr 05, 2014"

Pale yellow in color and not much head, not that I was expecting much for a white beer. You can pick up on the orange scent better from the bottle and out of a glass it smell more like a traditional white beer, but the taste comes out nicely for this particular type of beer. It was unique for what i have had in white beers but it wasn't astounding. Light taste, easy to drink almost fruity with a crisp after taste that lasts long enough to enjoy but doesn't stick around too long.

Nose is breaddy and cracker. There is a light grain sweetness that seems to be deep in the beer but not too strong or heavy. The fruit is subtle. A bit of lemon citrus, a very faint whisper of fresh orange. Some coriander adds earth to the nose. Taste is friendly and very drinkable. Dry, crisp and the flavor of lemongrass. The juicy orange lightly underneath and a crisp wheat dryness. Creamy body with active carbonation. A bit of earth finishes this one dry.","utopiajane","Feb 06, 2014"

The only distinction is the heavy after taste of lemongrass, which is why i give taste a 3.75. Heineken is about a 2.25 for me, but this aftertaste in Namaste is incredible. I'm not going to get more any time soon, the alcohol content is only 5% and it was I think $12 for a pint.

Light peppery and well balanced with a perfectly refreshing, lemon/ lighter orange-flavored finish. Although highly drinkable, it feels less carbonated after a fairly short while.

Creamy and birstly mouthfeel, Dry grainy husk flavor throughout, sharp wheat, some tart citrus flavors with a bit of grassyness and a super dry grainy finish with hearty wheat bread flavors lingering in the mouth. A touch of pucker, a lot of flavor, and intensely refreshing.","jtierney89","Jan 09, 2014"

Refreshing and light. Immediately, I think the body is too thin, though on the other hand, this adds to the thirst quenching on a hot day factor. Still, I'd prefer a slightly more robust feel. Mild bitterness in the finish. Floral hops and lemon grass with a dash of citrus, particularly lemons and oranges, respectively.

Aroma was a bit of wheat, mellowed nicely by orange citrus. Taste was clean, a bit of citrus up front, became herbal in the middle, with a bit of hoppy grain in the backend. Coated nicely, seemed a tad thin, but not bad. Overall, not bad. Well balanced flavor with a nice twist.","mountdew1","Apr 05, 2013"

This beer had great drinkability, it was really smooth and refreshing, I could see myself having no problem drinking the whole bottle, a great choice for a warm summer afternoon. What I liked most about this beer was how true to style and complex it was, it wasn't overdone by any means and it had great balance. What I liked least about this beer is that Dogfish Head doesn't put this in 12oz bottles, it seems like the perfect beer for that format, almost $10 dollars for 750ml of a 5% Witbier isn't a great deal. I don't think I would buy this beer again, maybe for a special occasion, but for the price I couldn't justify buying it often. All in all I was impressed with this beer, I was expecting something a little odd and different with this beer, instead I just got a really good tasting Witbier and that's just what I needed, good work guys, this is one solid and good tasting Witbier.","StoutHunter","Aug 24, 2012"

Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, clove, pepper, herbal, coriander, wheat, earth, grass, and yeast spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Very pleasant and enjoyable. Taste of lemon, orange zest, clove, grass, pepper, coriander, wheat, earth, and yeast spices. Light wheat tang on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, coriander, wheat, clove, pepper, grass, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish as expected. Nice flavor balance and complexity; with a nice level of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a slightly slick, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed at all. Overall this is simply just an excellent witbier. Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 21, 2012"

The aroma features an array of sensations including citrus, grainy malts, yeast, and something not unlike wheat. The body is about medium and fairly typical for the style. The taste had a slightly more bready flavor along with malts, pepper, and a dry finish. This one costs a few bucks so I am glad I got to try it at a brewfest.","puboflyons","Apr 07, 2012"

3.78,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"DogFish Head Namaste Witbier, 22oz. bomber: Witbiers have been one of my favorites ever since I had a Hoggarten on the Grand Place in Brussels. Aside from the ubiquitous Coors Blue Moon, you do not see many brewers pursuing this fine style of beer. DogFish Head has a good reputation, so, despite the ugly label, I picked up this bomber to see what DogFish Head could do. The thin pure white head sits atop a cloudy straw colored body, and effuses an aroma of citrus. Good witbier flavor, which stays very light. No aftertaste. The Namaste is a good effort by DogFish Head, and worthy of a try. I drink wheats and whites during the summer, and often more than one per sitting, often with fresh (for zest) or aged (for sweetness) lemon. A “statement” white beer just does not fit into the economics, and it is often the lemon that is more key to the flavor than the underlying brew. So Blue Moon will remain the staple.","iSip","Apr 03, 2012"

3.84,1.9,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"22 ounce bomber. It’s about 75 degrees and sunny outside, so to celebrate that spring has sprung I’m digging a rarity from Dogfish out of the back of the fridge. Namaste pours a hazy light gold, with a nice pillowy head that dissipates pretty quickly. Lots of little floaties remain in my glass. Not sure if that’s yeast, spice, or something else. Rustic is probably the best – and kindest - way to describe the appearance. Has the hallmark smell of a classic witbier, with notes of coriander and light citrusy orange peel the first things I pick up in the nose. I’m also getting a lemon character which I can only assume is the lemongrass. First taste is quite nice, as the beer has a certain thirst quenching impact, in that it hits the tongue and quickly washes to the sides of the mouth and down the throat almost too fast. Musky wheat malt holds up the structure of the beer from the onset, before it’s washed away by a cavalcade of spice and citrus. Yeast lends a slightly tart, almost sour note in a supporting role. The after finish is pleasant lemon pith. The beer finishes dry, with a hint of spicy carbonation, which leaves you wanting to go back to it and drink some more. Wits can often be heavy handed in the spice department, though that is not the case with Namaste, which arrives at a nearly perfect balance between the signature spices and the wheat and hops behind them. Kudos to the brewer, though the lengthy cellaring time may have had something to do with it as well. Despite the somewhat awkward appearance at the beginning, the beer is actually quite good, and certainly hits the spot on a warm spring day.","eclaycamp","Mar 16, 2012"

The aroma the label says it best you smell the floral and citrus aromas. You can taste a slight carameliness to it and it goes down super smooth. It is very easy to drink and is very light which is non typical for Dogfish Head. Another inspirational brew nevertheless. Try it its worth it to spend more when it counts.","assmandugle","Nov 07, 2011"

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I split a 750 ml bottle of this with my wife on a snowy, windy October day. The beer pours a milky, cloudy, pale yellow color with a puffy white head. It's aroma is a nice mix of pepper, zesty orange peel, and herbal scents. Lemon, orange, coriander, and white pepper are the most notable scents. These, along with some soft pale malt underneath, give the beer a solidly enjoyable aroma. The taste is a bit more peppery than expected, with a sharp spice flavor, but it also has a soft sweetness. Somewhat abrupt finish. Well balanced, and the orange character seems to give the beer a zesty, alive quality. Good beer.","Suds","Oct 29, 2011"
4.67,23.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"750ml bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Portsmouth. Pours a hazy light yellow body with a good half inch or so of white head. Smells very fruity and floral with a decent amount of spice. Oranges, coriander, lemon, pepper, and hints of caramel malt hit the palate. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Super-drinkable. Complex and unique but while flavorful, this beer is not in your face and everything blends very well complimenting each other. A great witbier. I'm quite impressed. Though at $10 per bottle, this will have to be an occasional treat.","MrHurmateeowish","Oct 26, 2011"

It goes down easy with hints of coriander and lemongrass along with a faint bitter orange peel finish. The profile is dead on. The mouthfeel is fine.

Banana taste is dominant. There is moderate carbonation and this is a light weight brew. Dogfish Head pretty much playing it safe here with a solid, but kind of boring witbier.

Picking up a lot citric, mostly loemon with some orange (banana even?) and a spicey, clove-like smell as well w/ a touch of sweetness coming from somewhere. A great witbier to drink is what follows; a smooth, fluffy body thanks to the wheat/yeast that is real smooth and there's a good amount of balance to this beer as there's a sharpness as well thanks to spices and a sharp but not overpowering citric bite. Citric consists of lemon and some orange and there's again that touch of sweetness I can't identify.

4.17,10.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Namaste pours a hazy tangerine, it seems a shade or two darker than most wits that I've had. The pristine white head rises up to about three fingers in height, and shows tremendous resilience. Lacing is a bit sparse though. The nose is very lemony, with coriander as the primary supporting aroma rather than orange. The flavor is quite crisp, yet dominated entirely by yeast/spice notes. Lemongrass's influence is still the star here, though the flavor seems a bit more citrusy than the nose. Coriander is still present as a background note again. The body is nice and light and the carbonation starts out incredibly lively but dies down by the back end of each sip and avoids being too fizzy. Lemongrass is a wonderful addition to the standard witbier flavors, and helps make this one of my absolute favorite warm weather beers.

The aroma is heavy on the spices, with coriander and lemongrass dominating and orange peal playing second fiddle. Orange, coriander and citrus on the front of the palate and than all lemongrass to the finish. The lemongrass is a huge flavor, it does however play well with the rest of the beer. Nice wheaty flavor pairs well with the spices and some fruity yeast twang can be found too. Well bodied for a smaller ale.

It reveals a bready light citrus lemon smell that includes a slight peppery quality. The flavor offers a classic white ale theme that includes a light banana-lemon subtle idea over sodabread and oak.

It's got excellent coriander and orange accents and has an orange like sweetness. The yeastiness is well contained and this beer drinks very well. It just doesn't have the same mouthfeel, same smoothness that is typical of DFH 750s, then again it is a much lighter beer. This beer is delicious and is an excellent wheat.","aasher","Dec 12, 2010"

Fresh and open nose, full but not close to heavy, the orange peel matches up with the coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon spice, maybe even a touch salty at times, the lemongrass stays in the background, nothing herbaceous going on here, by the same token the cocoa nibs about all you get for malts, as advertised citrus and spices 99% of what you find in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, foams up a good deal to increase palate coverage, little room for lift. More all of this heft, mouth feel is smooth and there's no roughness nor bitterness to be found. Orange, lemon, traces of white grapefruit citrus abound. Coriander, cumin, clove and ginger spice more sweet than zesty, hence the smoothness.

It's a fairly clean taste, but I'd really like to taste the base beer more and the adjuncts less. The body is a bit light on this one with moderate carbonation and no alcohol warming. Not overly drinkable because of the dominance of the lemongrass and coriander and the relative lack of complexity. It doesn't help either that I'm not a huge fan of witbiers.

Flavor wise this is an excellent witbier, it's rare to see any beer brewed this much to style. Other than the lemongrass there's not much stray from a typical wit and this is an excellent fresh version of one. Heavy on the coriander, for those sensitive to it this won't be your beer, but it's definitely a rounded coriander. It's complemented with orange peel bitterness and lemon grass herbal tones, soft wheat creamy character this is excellent stuff. Mouthfeel has sturdy but smooth carbonation creamy body carries itself well light to medium in girth. Clean spicy finish these spices don't sit on the palate the carbonation and citrus helps to clear the coriander.

The taste is awesome with that lemon taste and that smooth orange taste that gets bitter at the end of the sip. The bitterness is different than you'd find in most beers because of the orange taste melding together with the lemon taste. The bitterness is like licking the inside skin of an orange I like it. Also has a nice dry wheat backing to finish everything off. Excellent beer... and I was surprised to see the low alcohol content on the bottle making the drinkability awesome.

Mouthfeel is fluffy and medium thick, initially dominated by over active carbonation which distracts from whatever is going on with the flavors.

Actually, to properly describe the situation, the pepper's on Prozac, so it's still dancing about in the finish, as though all of its problems were really gone (how sad, really...). The body is light, with a light carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice wit. 'Nuff said, baby.","TMoney2591","Jul 16, 2010"
4.18,10.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Namaste pours a beautiful, slightly cloudy straw yellow with ample carbonation that produces a soft white head full of tiny bubbles. The head stays around forever and leaves some goopy lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is sweet with notes of honey, lemon zest, orange, wheat, bready yeast and a touch of white pepper. The flavor is very refined and very tasty with a very sweet, yet also slightly tart wheat malt background. It is lemony and spicy with hints of white pepper and coriander and is very refreshing. It is well balanced and all of the flavors play off of each other very well. For being a fairly sweet beer, it is impressive how thirst quenching it is. It has a fairly light and creamy mouthfeel that has a tart and refreshing finish. Very drinkable and a beer that I am glad came in a large bottle.","zoso1967","Jul 16, 2010"
3.95,4.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Very drinkable, very refreshing and a fun take on the traditional Witbier. I could easily keep drinking this beer on a nice summer afternoon. A little more citrus to this one than you'd be used to if you were into Wit's. I like it quite a bit but it won't dethrone some of the more faithful styles for me.","MikeB20","Jul 15, 2010"

3.23,-14.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Namaste pours into the glass looking bright hazy yellow with somehazy yellow and specs or squeezed orange. It gets darker towards the end of the bottle with the yeast. A nice bright white head with good retention but no stick, semi thick looking. Smells include wheat, coriander, lemongrass and orange peel. I get alot of sweet cereal like scents kinda like honeycombs. It's off putting. Taste starts off great with wheat mixed in with coriander and lemongrass. Squeezed orange makes for a push but is overpowered by the lemongrass which rules the roost. In the middle banana comes out to play. With warming things turn downhill, this gets a bit to sweet for me and the cereal comes through and a bit artificial tasting. Adding the yeast at the end did not make things better, even sweeter. The feel is above light bodied and is quaffable and refreshing to a degree, it's carbed up as well but fades with warming leaving for a thicker coat for a sec. I liked this for the 1st 12oz or so but grew tired of it and poured the rest out, it's just not my type of wit. It's to style but not incredibly balanced. Good for a gander.","BARFLYB","Jul 04, 2010"

Nice crisp beer which is another addition to the great list of session beers I have tried as of late.
