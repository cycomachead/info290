3.72,8.8,3.75,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured into a Blanche de Namur small pint glass.  Pours a golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of wheat, coriander, light orange citrus. Flavor of light wheat with strong coriander, mild citrus a hint of butteriness. Nice medium body with light creaminess and active carbonation. A mild witbier that is not quite able to support the level of coriander spicing. The light flavors of wheat and citrus are nice, but a bit underwhelming. A hint of the diacetyl that seems common in Boston Beer offerings, but at a level that add a pleasant mellowing component to this as is usually the case. I'd probably go for a more traditional witbier in the future, but this was easy and light and worked well for a warm afternoon.","LiquidAmber","Saturday at 04:49 PM"

One finger pale white head quickly fades to a thin cap with virtually no lacing.  On the nose, strong malt and spices evident.

So far, I've only had this one (Cold Snap) and I have to stay that I'm fairly happy it's now available in my area. It offers a refreshing taste that has a good spiciness to it (although maybe too much coriander), and if oyu're looking for a good Witbier, this is much better than Hoegaarden.","PorterPro125","Mar 11, 2015"

3.78,10.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,"Poured in to a pint glass, a marshmallow-like crown of finely carbonated foam graces the hazy, honey-golden ale before briskly receding to a one finger head. Thin lacing remains as the only sign of that remarkable white cap. Excellent retention. The aroma promises sweet citrus orange, and ripe purple plum. The first sip brings a bready sweet malt backbone with a balanced orange peel zest. The moderate spicing accentuates the citrus notes and gives it a peppery punch. There's a nice grassy wheat flavor that permeates the whole experience. Fairly clean finish, as the balance of flavors restrain any one of the elements from becoming too dominant. The mouthfeel is a tad watery, with tame carbonation, making it extremely easy to gulp. Refreshing and satisfying. A touch basic, but delicious nonetheless. For a mass-marketed seasonal American witbier it stands above it's contemporaries. It lacks the near-cloying sweetness of Blue Moon and the off aftertaste. It steers clear of the adjunct flavors that creep in to Shocktop, and has more nuance than the fruity pebbles flavors of Sunset Wheat. I enjoy all of the aforementioned beers to one degree or another, but Cold Snap is definitely a step above in my mind. It's no Allagash White, but it's pretty damn tasty.","JohnnyI","Jan 27, 2015"

Lightly carbonated, and tastes a bit thin but with light orange and spice flavor, like a slightly watered down creamcicle with a bit of a yeast kicker.  Wouldn't drink a bunch of these, but refreshing and enjoyable.","Columbus37","Jan 27, 2015"

Obviously, a very different beer than an IPA, but it shone through for what it is: a decent, (although certainly not top notch)  witbier. There is a time, place, and mood for this beer (for me, anyway), and it fulfills it's purpose respectably enough. Definitely don't mind having a few kicking around in the fridge for when the mood strikes.","Burnthedevice","Jan 03, 2015"

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with a half inch white head. Heaed retention is decent enough, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells like orange peel, coriander, wheat/bready malt, and a bit of bubblegum. It tastes like orange peel, wheat/bready malt, coriander, and a sweet spiciness in general. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has low/moderate carbonation. I think it's an OK brew overall. I wouldn't turn one down, but I wouldn't make a point to seek it out either. With that being said, I would like to try a fresher bottle in the future.","bluejacket74","Jun 07, 2014"

To be it was average in taste, I would not shy away from it in the future, it is a good stand-by beer, but if I have some else to choose I will go with something else. This beer is better than the larger brands, but compares well with other craft beers. It is a good beer to have with steak.","manofmanners","May 11, 2014"

Pours nicely with a good head but not so much decoration on the sides of my glass. Cloudy and golden it has a good look to it. The smell is different for the style with a large malt body that has less twang and more bread than is common. Notes of vanilla and and orange with light coriander. An almost bubblegum sweetness. Taste has a lot of fruitiness, ( the added plum ) and spices. Body is quite round and full with a lemony honey maltiness. The orange peel shows in the the finish with nice zesty kick while still being low in bitterness, just enough to refresh and clean the palate. Feel is on the thicker side for a wit with a mild carbonation. Not the home run of the Alpine by a longshot, but a decent quality beer nonetheless.","scootny","May 07, 2014"

Smells tangy, citric, almost a bit metallic or sanguine, with some light citrus and green notes apparent. Tastes like a proficiently brewed if not conservative wit, the coriander is right where it should be (i.e., barely detectable) and there is a pleasant orange and lemon water vibe running from start to finish. I get some wheat spice and a floral almost tobacco-like faint hop presence but nothing too aggressive. Maybe a hair thicker than the average witbier, with a super-clean citric finish, just a hint of woody spice seed. One-dimensional but tasty enough I suppose. Does not match the grandeur of St. Bernardus Wit, Blanche De Chambly, or the like but does not embarrass itself either.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 20, 2014"

This time it's a seasonal wit from Sam Adams, which pours a hazy tawny-orange topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose is your usual wit base, comprising orange peel, light coriander, cracked wheat, and a twist of lemon; added on is a decently strong sense of straight grain, leaving things to take on a white bread sort of aroma, luckily mostly throughout the background. The taste brings in more of the same, that same white bread bit now a bit louder, but still second tier. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda crisp finish. Overall, an okay wit, but that breadiness really holds it back. If nothing else, it's better than the Cubs' performance in St. Louis...","TMoney2591","Apr 13, 2014"

It has the appearance of apple cider but lighter. This beer is not filtered so it is cloudy. The smell of this brew is sweet with citrus , also smell rich. This brew has smell and look of other wheat beers on the market. The taste is ok nothing fancy but you can taste the citrus. I not picking up on the plum in this brew. Cold Snap goes down smooth and crisp, not a bad brew at all. There is nothing bad about the taste or smell of this brew. This would be a nice beer to drink on spring night after a long day. Over all I giving Samuel Adams Cold Snap a 4 out 5 one of the better Samuel Adams brews I had .","nicholas2121","Mar 20, 2014"

Forget that a mass marketer (or at least a large scale microbrew) makes it. It pours a hazy unfiltered golden color with moderate carbonation. Leaves slight lacing around the glass when sipping it. Gives the wheat taste with a large amount of citrus, mainly orange and if I'm not mistaken has the coriander vibe going as well. Great session beer weighing in at 5.3 abv and I'd give it the edge on Blue Moon. Worth checking out and grabbing as a party pleaser beer.","Ryanm1","Mar 07, 2014"

The light and crisp citrus plays on the smell in the forefront with a little bit of wheat on the back end. I loved the smell. Very fizzy on the first sip with many of the citrus flavors coming out. A lot of lemongrass and a little bit of coriander and spice on the end. It was a lot lighter than I thought it was going to be from the smell but I ended up liking that. It's still a bit too cold for this beer but by March or April I can definitely see grabbing a twelve pack or two. One of my only criticisms is that it's very similar to their White Christmas.","WhiteHillsStore","Feb 08, 2014"

I looked forward to that beer every spring. That being said, Cold Snap is very similar and familiar. It has a classic old Samuel Adams scent, with orange peel, coriander, lemon zest, and grainy wheat. The scent is also very floral. Where I think it does out do White Ale is the aftertaste, which is sweet, not cloying, and crisp. Anytime Jim Koch puts a light blue cap on the bottle, it's a good one!","bigdeuce","Feb 07, 2014"

I like the way you taste coriander right away and it does make it a bit snappy (pun intended) with a nice peppery aspect with the orange element taking second and that helps the wheat malt which is the foundation, not much else to comment on except I like how the taste finishes dry. Overall I enjoy what Samuel Adams does with wheat - I know we are not talking Infinium but this is pretty good as far as Wit beers go.","Slatetank","Jan 22, 2014"

Wheat, OK, but too much wheat, orange zest, meh, just weird orange icing flavors, and fake vanilla, with other spices, into a pre-digested gingerbread and orange cake with tons of orange frosting that's just not good. Even the finish doesn't know how to, um, finish, between the sticky, dry, creamy, syrupy, etc. Can't imagine why they would put this out, I can't even finish it. I almost want to order this at a bar one day, so I can spit it in their face and demand a different beer, just so I can waste it... then again it might taste better spit out.","jlindros","Jan 21, 2014"

3.56,4.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of a Witbier with spices and orange peels, it had good balance with the orange being right below the point of being too much with just enough spices to provide some balance and all that smoothness that comes with the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, refreshing, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention and I could see myself drinking a few of these once it starts to warm up outside, it's got about the same drinkability as Oberon. What I liked the most about this beer was how the spices weren't overdone, that tends to happen often in this style, but not with this beer. What i liked the least about this beer was that they put it out and promote it so early, I like the beer, just not when it's still below freezing in Michigan, but I'm sure in a few months from now it will fit in good with the weather. I might buy this again when it gets warmer, but there's good chance I'll just go with Oberon instead. I would recommend this if you like your Witbiers heavy on the orange. All in all I didn't mind this beer, it was good for what it is and I find it to be similar to Oberon, but I like Oberon more since Oberon tastes more wheaty with a nice yeast flavor. Nice work guys, this was a solid example of the style, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Jan 19, 2014"

The taste is very pleasing with the fruits and spices of a peppery-bite of corriander coming through that ends in a slight dryness on the tongue for the finish. Very easy to drink and goes down easy.

This is what Sam Adams has done here, as this is an above average take on this style. I think they finally found a Spring seasonal they can stick with, unless they decide to make it year round.","CraftyHusker","Jan 07, 2014"

I was very happy with the ""White Ale"" they had from 2004-2010, but then they went all over the place with Noble Pils, and Alpine Spring. This time, they brought back the White Ale, with a little extra.. very well done, really hope they stick with this one this time!","paladinjoe","Jan 05, 2014"
