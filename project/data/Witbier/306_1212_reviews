"Love this beer. Very nice flavor. Perfect summer beer. I think of this as a vacation beer because it's always available wherever I happen to travel. This flavor is tied to pleasant nostalgia for me."

"I'm not going to lie, but this is orse!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Well...Well...Well... Again, a beer I've been looking forward to sampling... Started off amazing... Fruity followed by a nutty aftertaste but this became an acquired taste after a few sips... We'll made beer with some strengths but not one I'd chose of Hoegaarden Witbier..."
"This is my favorite beer, and it is great with orange especially."
""
"Love this beer so much"
""
""
"The number one beer of choice for my in-laws. Dark orange color, white head. Smell is spice, yeast. Coriander. Slight citrus, very subtle. Taste is clean, smooth. Spicy coriander, subtle orange peel, yeasty. Lower side of carbonation. Almost creamy. I like blue moon a lot especially after a couple cheaper beers like PBR. Forget who makes it if hat turns you away. This is a great beer. If it was a little cheaper in my area instead of almost $12 for a sixer, and well over $30 for a case, it would be an every day beer for me. Very enjoyable."

"Great beer for a wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a beer I can find anywhere and everywhere in the Midwest, pretty damn good."
""
""
"O: Not bad. With a slice of orange it would make a pretty refreshing summer brew."
""
"a good cheap americanized witbier"
"Overall one of my favorites."
""
"I used to drink this a lot before I got into craft. I had it on a whim for ole times sake. Truly not bad for a macro. It is refreshing and I would not turn it down on a hot summer day. However, it's attempt at orange fruitiness, although somewhat tasty, nevertheless has too much of an orange soda flavor to it. Like I said, I would not turn it down, but with all the other great brews I have yet to try, I will not seek this one out."
"Not much words in this one besides the fact that it is simply great."
""
"This is a great beer. My favorite beer of all time.  This beer is great with an orange wedge. Best beer ever!"
""
""
""
"I like this beer a lot. If you add an orange to it, it makes it even better."
"A light beer with some citrus flavors in it.  Was served to me with an orange slice, which complimented it nicely.  Not the greatest beer I've had, but it was an enjoyable experience."
"This is the perfect beer for beginners who want to get into ""real"" beer. A gateway beer, if you will."
""
"My go to beer. Nothing wrong with it."
""
"Cloudy and Golden, Orange Smelling, Citrusy with Light carbonation, Creamy finish."
"Nice body and carbonation, bitterness should be higher in my opinion."
""
""
"Great wheat style beer. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side. Has typical cloudy golden look for the style. Good balance between hops malt and wheat. Hard to drink only one"
"O: [3.25] Full disclosure - I thought I had this a long time ago and didn't like it - so I have always avoided it.  That being said, I was wrong.  This is a decent beer.  Nothing spectacular - but I don't actively dislike it.  The flavors are muted and come across as a sweet corn taste.  I thought there was Belgian yeast or wheat flavor but I am getting none of that.  I owe Blue Moon and apology.  Sorry.  (There I said it)."
""
"Glass- Stein with an orange slice"
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp and golden. Swell of wheat and oranges. Has to be one of the best American Belgians other than Shiner and Flying Dog."
"Buy a real heff. This has been terrible since it was bought by Coors."
""
""
"Favourite beer to buy, and safest option when undecided about what to get."
""
""
"Smooth & refreshing.  A beer you could happily drink in any weather."
""
"Love it on tap, bottled just OK. Feel as long as they serve it with an orange slice I can call it healthy. I think one of the better citrus flavored beers."
""
"Interesting interpretation of the style. A touch thick for my preference in white ales. Good gateway beer."
"O: I really like this witbier in the summer, always with the orange slice."
""
"Keg of blue moon drank."
"As with most wheat beers the texture is fairly plain but the flavor is light and citrus."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by my revisit to one of the first beers I ever tried and liked.  I was fully expecting the ""not quite as good as I remembered"" experience so many people mention having upon making a return visit to one of their first beers, but ended up with the exact opposite.  I have to wonder if the people who bash on this beer are really just bashing on the company that makes it rather than any actual negative qualities of the beer itself... or maybe others in the style are just *that* much better that people start to mistake ""less good than this other really amazing thing"" with ""not good at all," as people tend to do? I'll have to try some of the others and see, I suppose."
""
""
""
""
"Blue moon is a sell out. Without an orange it tastes like shit, I used to think it was a good beer and now it's just ass"
""
""
""
""
"Always smooth just the right citrus flavor without being overpowering or sweet. No aftertaste."
""
"This is a good beer, however I do not see what all the fuss is about there are cheaper and better wheat beers out there. Have paid 5 GBP for a pint of this, which is quite frankly ridiculous."
""
"Overall, if there are no other respectable draught beers on tap at a given restaurant, I'm going with Blue Moon 100% of the time. Great beer."
""
""
"Not to bad considering it is available in every bar in the US."
""
"Good beer, I think it's better on tap then out of the bottle"
"Has a slightly orange flavor while still tasting like beer."
""
""
"Run of the mill and ugly."
"Not bad for an Americanized Belgian."
"Love this beer. One of my favorites!"
""
""
"Review based on Orange slice added. Perfect refreshing summer beer. Fruity but not too hoppy to my disspointment. Certianly my favourite wheat beer and one of my go to's."
""
""
""
"Pretty okay beer, tastes better with an orange peel. Good choice if options are sparse."
"Miller Coors adjunct bull shit"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my fav. Not strong enough..."
""
"Great summer beer, tasty hops and easy to drink. When having a pool party, just add some of this and it will be a success!"

"good drinkable beer, no after taste, clean and refreshing, good summer beer"
""
"This is a great beer with an orange"
""

""
""
""
""
"Great wheat beer.  This was my second try at a wheat beer and I have found a new favorite.  Good easy drink."
""
"Nice mouthfeel, but weird aftertaste."
""
""
"12 oz. bottle from BevMo. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a white head. Aroma of yeast and faint spices. Smooth malt taste. Creamier than a typical witbier. Not overly spicy. Hints of coriander and orange peel. Little hop taste. All in all enjoyable, interesting and very drinkable."
""
""
"Nice witbier with a good use of spices."
""
"was ok, had it with the orange... taste was well better with a orange"
""
"Had to rate, i wanted a true list of beers I've had. Tasty beer, but once you get into true Belgians and craft beer you probably won't drink this again."
"Poured in to a pint glass casually, there is no head or lacing whatsoever. Only a faint white ring around the collar. Very low key carbonation. The appearance is that of an opaque, bronze, spiced apple cider. Buttery banana esters are complimented by a little spice and some sour citric aromas. The taste is sweet and flavorful, with earthy spicing and a citrusy coriander that lingers well in to the finish. The aftertaste is of mild metallic mineral and grain. After a few sips, a funky yeast flavor builds on the palate and is a little offputting. The brew is mildly carbonated with medium mouthfeel and the low alcohol content helps keep the beer crisp and refreshing. If not for the borderline cloying sweetness and odd aftertaste, this would be a stellar beer. Still one of the best widely distributed American examples out there though. After all, who hasn't enjoyed a Blue Moon from time to time? It's been around for quite awhile (20 years give or take). Well before craft beer reached the fevered high that it has hit today. That said, it's stood the test of time because it's pretty good. I'm not losing my mind over this, but I give credit where credit is due."
"Good cheap beer, every place carries this stuff."
"My favorite, so I am a little bias"
""
""
"Very smooth taste for a reasonable price"
""
"Not a bad wheat beer pretty generic, good beer for the beginners or someone who isn't a beer drinker."
"Overall: decent, no off flavors."
""
"Just really good. It tastes really citrusy"
""
"only good thing about this is the look which is misleading. Tastes bland and watery with just a hint of Belgian flavor. I'll stick with actual Belgians."
""
"I wanna say I very much liked this."
""
""
"Bottle from supermarket. Poured into a sraight half pint glass which produced an unapealing bubbly head. Cloudy golden straw colour. Sweet aroma with spritzer like mouthfeel which reminded me of a cheap sweet sugary white wine. Didn't taste much better and I'm afraid I couln't finish the glass ( which doesnt happen often!)  Overal a very poor imaitation!"
""
""
"Overall? I drink this often. Amazing to know Coors does this beer. A solid drinker."
""
"Definitely one of my favorites  for sure"
""
""
"Was searching for a beer that I can always enjoy, and this is definitely it!"
"I noticed only stale yeast and blandness. I don't like to give a  bad review, so instead I'll will wait a few weeks and try another  bottle. I've read reviews on citrus which I love in my Wits and honestly say not hint of it here."
""
"O - A good wheat.  Nothing crazy here just straightforward flavor and typical wheat beer feel.  3.25/5"
""
"It wasn't my flavor. It was forgettable. I actually forgot I had it before until recently"
""
"good all around beer for all year"
""
""
""
""
"Always my beer of choice. Very citrusy with a full body."
"Standard. Not great, but not at all bad. Domestic go to."
""
""
"Nice crisp citrus taste. Great for hot days"
"Really good session beer. I think I'm going to keep this in my house.  If you haven't tried it and you like smooth beers, then give this a try. By far, Coors best offering."
""
"Not bad better than the other beers on the menu Applebee's."
"Not a lot of bite or flavor but not a bad option. You could do worse"
""
"It's been a while since I had one, not really that bad.  When choices are slim you could do much worse."
""
"Smooth witbier, very light. I would recommend it to my daughter on her 18th birthday instead of her regular orange juice. Not very exciting but good, just like Hoegaarden or Blanche de Namur. Underrated on BA, definitely."
""
"    Decent head atop a cloudy  orangey liquid. Not much retention or lacing, but some. Smell is good though,with a healthy wheat malt twang and notes of bananas and apples. A bit of soap mixed with yeast. Taste has more of the same with good flavors of cereal grains, light sugars, and powdery yeast. Light fruits and lemony zestiness. A touch of honey. Crisp feel is a strongpoint and the lively carbonation has a light creaminess. Great drinkability tries to compensate for the lack of depth flavor wise. There's taste here and it's far more that the BMC partners usual offerings but its shallowness belies its parentage. Still ill drink it and enjoy it for what it is. Decent and quaffable."
""
""
"My favorite beer and fortunately available most places"
""
"Remarks:  good session ale for a large market beer"
"I really don't feel the need to justify every poor rating with a review!!!"
"It's decent for beer, but it's outstanding for Coors beer. Cheap, available, very drinkable beer in my book."
""

"This beer is horrible!! GROSS!  I took 2 sips and couldn't drink it!"

"Pretty good beer you can find anywhere."
"I decided to finally rate this beer after having had Shock Top (which royally sucked), and while I certainly don't rate this brew highly, it is definitely a slight cut above the Shock Top.  It's a slightly less crappy crafty version of a decent witbier.  Is it a palatable option at pubs that only serve AALs?  Perhaps, but just barely.  I would only purchase this if there was absolutely nothing else I could stand on tap."
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, but the taste is different than most beers. I'm not much into wheats, so it's not my favorite."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite non-local brews. Golden in color, it has quite a nice citrus smell. Bars and restaurants tend to serve it with an orange, its taste is fine and smooth."

"Being someone who hates the bitterness if IPAs, beers like Blue Moon give a pleasant taste, while not too sweet as a hard cider would give."
"Great everyday beer for me.  Can find it on draft most places."

"In my opinion Blue Moon is the very best of the major brand's ""craft beer"" niche. The fact that Blue Moon is a main stream beer does not detract from it's obvious quality and pleasant attributes. Blue Moon is a work of fine quality and artistic craftsmanship."

"Excellent place to start with wheat beers. great texture, nice finish and a smooth taste with a heavy citrus flavor. All in all a good wheat beer."
""

"Alright fall back beer, though a good introduction to what exists out there other than your traditional lager. As a witbier it's run of the mill with a citrus background, though always decent on a hot day. I would recommend it for purchasing for a larger amount of people, or for a party. However, I could think of other witbier that is a lot better... If you are only used to very basic brews and are looking to branch out a bit, this isn't a bad starting point. In terms of the actual company that makes the brew, there is some minor controversy. Bluemoon is an example of a large corporation, MillerCoors, pretending to be a smaller independent brewer."

"12 oz bottle in a glass.   Pours orange in color, and the head quickly dissipates.  Carbonation is high.  I want to say it smells like orange or citrus, but the smell was muted, probably more wheat than anything.  The taste immediately hits on the lemon lime notes, with a wheat quality on the back of the palette.  I tasted some grapefruit and orange notes as well, mixed in with the wheat.  The label says its complex, and I will agree.  There are is lot of fruit and citrus in this brew.  Remarkably, the beer goes down exceptionally smooth and you have to be careful not too drink too many because they're so refreshing.  Blue moon remains one of the best convenience store, mass market wheat beers.  Top notch."

""
""
""
""
""

"Strong spicy savory flavor, goes great for those brisk Fall evenings and freezing Winter nights by the fireplace. Goes great with orange or even a lime."
"Great taste"
""
""
"good for a macrobrew it is a lighter than most witbeirs need's an orange tho you can also just throw a shot of oj in instead... good intro to the style."
""
"It is still a good beer. I just can't bring myself to ever buy it or drink it because of the company behind it. Definitely beer snobbery 101. If you are a light beer person looking to transition into the craft sector, definitely give this one a try."
""

"Typical of American beers trying to copy European quality brews, they don't even come close, taste like Coors and that is not a compliment.  Read some of the ratings online and on this site and it said Ok - good.  I have spent most of my life in Europe and have tried everything from Belgium to Czech, Dutch, and German.  That is where Beer tastes best.  It's not just just the taste of the beer but the glasses they serve it in and the atmosphere.  At home in America I still find that most American beers are mass produced, highly marketed and taste all the same in most cases."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. 'Not my cup of tea' (as we say in Northern Ireland) but I think if you are into Lambic style beers this is probably more for you. I approached this beer expecting something more in the lines of  a typical Belgian or Dutch wheat beer and was put off by the sour vinegar nature of this one. I feel almost guilty for rating it in the way I have but in Belfast it was either marketed incorrectly or it is not what it claims to be."

"As a new beer drinker, this is the first I've ever tried that had me saying, ""wow, I actually really like this."" Had it served in a pint glass with an orange slice, the only thing I didn't like was the slight funky odor. Until I find something I like better, this will be my go-to when available."

"I'm not ashamed to admit that this is one of my favorite beers out there. It's a joy to look at (the cloudy, straw-colored, liquid looks fantastic when thirsty) and the taste is strong enough but not overwhelming. The orange peel and coriander are easy to detect, while there is no yeasty aftertaste (which is a huge plus in my books)."

"I have a fondness for Bluemoon. It was the first beer that had flavor and added the expectation of flavor to my palate. It made me look at the ""other aisles"" other than the adjunct lager section. It was my notice for the idea of Craft Beer and the existence other beers other than adjunct lagers."

"Always one of my favorite. Golden color, solid foam, and a cloudy look once poured. Smells of citrus fruit is great. The taste is non bitter and very easy going down. I understand that Blue Moon may not be a craft beer in the truest sense, but its a favorite of mine. Always a fall back choice."

"Overall - blue moon is a fine wit beer, and something I was certainly happy to have available to me while on vacation, instead of the usual adjunct and light lagers. Nevertheless as far as wit beers go it's still only in the middle of the pack, some worse but many better, but definitely serves as a great and accessible introductory craft-like beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not amazing, but not abrasive. This was my gateway beer - it showed me that there was an enjoyable world beyond American adjunct lagers. Widespread enough that it makes a good fall-back beer when selection is limited. I prefer this to Shock Top."

"OVERALL: I’m pretty surprised at my review of this. I thought I’d be trashing this beer like it was Stella. That said, exceeding my expectations was not a difficult thing to do. This beer is certainly not what I would choose out of any lineup, even if it was a lineup of all Belgian Whites, but it is tolerable…I’m just still freaked out about this little brown blob that’s still floating in the beer. I’m sure it’s fine, but it creeps me out."

"Pours a nice cloudy straw yellow, with a head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is light on the citrus and a bit of spice. The taste is very smooth with a mellow orange flavor. Overall, this is not a bad beer, especially considering it's brewed by Coors. It's problem is that it is just kind of ""blah""."

"This beer is OK. I would not consider it in the upper echelon of brews. I can certainly think of many other brews I would like to have before I order this one. Today, with the availability of craft beer everywhere this is one I order when I do not have a choice. This weekend I was at a hotel that did not have much to choose from and Blue moon is certainly a better bet than a Coors or its equivalent. It is a decent everyday beer if and when craft beers are not an option."

"I find this beer to be reliable in taste and availability. The bitter earwax taste of many beers puts me off, and it is quite small in Blue Moon. Delicious with a slice of lemon. I like that it's not too foamy, and color is a light honey. It does not offend."

"I love wheat beers and this beer in particular. It tastes great and is infinitely drinkable - particularly in the summer time. It's smooth, has great flavor, and has balanced carbonation. I prefer it on tap to bottled, but both are fantastic. Writing this review makes me want to go get one...enjoy!"
"A standard at most bars and liquor stores (speaking from CT). The color was a midly hazy yellow with a fizzy head that left pretty quickly. The smell was a lot of citrus and a nice amount of wheat. Unfortunately the wheat was overpowered in the taste by the citrus. Very tart beer. That being said though it was pretty refreshing for a summer day and pairs well with most bbq food. If you're having a party, I don't think anyone would be disappointed by this choice."
"This beer was good I have had it a couple of times. I have had it in a bottle and on draft. I liked it on draft a little better than in the bottle. But I think it is good both ways in the bottle and on draft. If you put a orange in it it males ot taste better. At least in my opinion it makes it taste better. It is not a jeavy beer as well wich I liked. If you have not had it you should try it."

"On-tap variant slightly more smooth, but resulting joy is same."
"i drink this stuff all day and i never get tired of it. one day i took a sip of budweiser, spat it out, and yelled ""what is i this shite?! get me a blue mooon!"""
"Overall: I think this is a fine beer for huge groups or parties. It is much more flavorful than the standard BMC affair and is a beer everyone seems able to get behind without complaint. Great for gatherings and a beer I would order if nothing better was available on the menu. Enjoy it for what it is- an easy drinking crowd pleaser, not a philosophical world-class exemplification of the style."

"Pours a cloudy orange color with a thin head. Smells appetizing but doesn't taste quite as good as it smells. Mouthfeel is decent, just slightly too watery for my taste but not bad at all. Easy drinking, 5.4% gives it just a little more kick than a 5% beer. A good choice on a hot California day."

"Taste: strong orange flavor at first, then a bit spice which finishes with a bold wheaty taste. The orange flavor is so strong it makes me wonder why its always served withan orange."

"When in a college town where the local bars have at least 2 Miller taps and 2 Bud Light taps on display it's always a refreshing sight to see a Blue Moon tap somewhere in the mix. Blue moon has a cloudy golden color and light to medium body for a wheat beer. I admit that the flavor is often overpowered by the orange served with the beer but the hints of citrus and coriander of the beer itself are quite pleasant. For a mass produced product of the Coors company, this is a welcome option."

"Overall this is outstanding when served in a tulip glass after dinner when you can pay attention to its delicate nose, flavor, and mouthfeel. It is still very good with dinner at a restaurant where it is typically served in a tall glass with a slice of orange on the rim. It is fine for a backyard barbeque, but most of its virtues would likely be missed. It is very similar to, but better than Champagne, thanks to its broader body and more complex flavor. It seems that every time I drink this beer I find something new and I want to give it a higher rating; the first time I tried it in a tulip glass was a game changer; I am now liking it more than St. Bernardus."
""
""
"Pours pale gold with white head. It's fairly cloudy and produces lots of bubbles. Smell is very citrusy, grapefruit and orange stand out. The spice notes come through more in the taste. It's also fairly sweet. Haven't had one in a long time, but this will be my go to wheat beer now."
""
"Overall a great twist on a witbier, if you like spices coriander mainly. I do wish the coriander was more subtle, letting the wheat and orange notes shine through. But not bad at all. I've had this brew several times and will again. It's just so easy to find and when you are looking in a cooler at a gas station and see nothing else, its worth grabbing."

"Lately, I have been drinking Imperial Stouts and DIPAs. Today I stopped and got a burger for lunch, and decided to wash it down with an ol' Blue Moon. Boy was it bland. Not knocking the beer, just was a noteworthy experience. I've essentially ruined my palate due to the high abv DIPAs and Stouts to the point where one of my favorite standbys are no longer enjoyable. Sad day."

"This was the first beer I drank consistently. A great starter beer! The Belgian style is light enough to make it drinkable, yet it became too sweet for me as I began to experiment and enjoy IPAs and stouts. The orange and citrus finish really makes this a beer to remember and I recommend it to those who have not yet found that ""perfect beer"" yet!"

"Very hazy golden hued with orange tint. A minuscule bit of white foam covers most of the top. Strong aroma of orange along with pale wheat and a bit of coriander. The taste is a burst of orange with pale wheat playing second fiddle. The coriander is coming up in the fade. The body is a bit thin. The orange flavor overpowers."

"this beer is not my fav. i will drink when its presented to me for enjoyment but not my first or second choice when given other reasonable options. the blue moon is generally served with an orange and i prefer to drink without the garnish. the fruit adds fruity tones to the palate but it lacks the hoppy notes i tend to prefer in a beer. nothing bad about this beer though."
"This is my favorite beer by a large margin. I'm no deep beer aficionado so I can't pick it apart piece by piece but simply put it is a genuinely delicious beer that fits almost any occasion. I highly recommend tossing in an orange slice with it as well, it noticeably improves an already good flavor."

"This is my first Belgian... fell in love on the first sip at the Hooters. Always beware of this beer not tasting great on tap if its old stock - meaning not a moving product in a not so famous spot. Don't ever buy the bottle... its a good-on-tap kind."

"Blue Moon Belgian White brewed by Coors. This brew is non-filtered but pours amber with a white head. I'm not a big fan of non-filtered beers. This beer smells like citrus and beer. The taste is good with smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew. This beer goes down smooth and fresh. Overall I give this beer a 3.75 out of 5. This was a good beer."

"For the pleasure this beer has given me over the years i have to say this is one of those that i always go back for over and over again. My first serving of this beer was back in 2006, we've been friends ever since. Its not my favorite though, i am a stout drinker but in the social setting i turn to this white ale. Its not too heavy but its full of flavor and perfect with a complimentary garnishing of orange slice."

"Not a fan of wheat beers but this has to be one of the best tasting wheat beers I've had.. and I'm also familiar with this type of wheat brew with the fruit addition and this is one of the best if not the best I've had.. Again I'm not that into wheat beers so I'm sure there are many more.. but for what it is it's pretty good beer.. TBH to me it barely even tasted like beer.. more like some fruit drink beer... It's def. worth a try.."

Would really recommend this beer its very tasty and light , don't be afraid of the Blue Moon! The sweet taste is very refreshing I really was surprised at the color and non filtering of this beer it was very enjoyable! I just wondering if filtering the water would change the taste at all I know it would not change the color or appearance. Ill have to ask Keith Villa when I meet him he did a great job on this brew!"

"Overall, I like this beer. It was one of the first beers that I branched into from the generic stuff that's drank at college parties. After I found out this beer was made by Coors, and since I've got into the artful craft of beer brewing/tasting, I noticed how generic and bland this beer is. It's a nice stepping stone beer if those who are drinking the cheap, mass-produced beer made from the Big 3. It's cheap, has way more flavor than Coors, Shock Top, etc... I'd buy this beer again if I was going to a party, but not for myself."

"O: Blue Moon is the beer that got me into the craft world, so it still holds a special place in my heart and, admittedly, I still get slightly defensive when people bash it. While I admit that Blue Moon is a sub-par brew, it's leagues ahead of all the other mass-produced swill sold by the Big Three. Blue Moon remains my session beer at parties and social gatherings when it's too expensive to supply craft, and not acceptable to bring beer just for myself."

"Blue Moon's Belgian White is very, very good. I wasn't impressed at first with it's appearance out of the bottle - cloudy Belgian Whites normally do that to me. However, from that point forward I was happy with the experience. A very appealing wheat smell was followed up with a bold and refreshing tang to the taste buds. I have to say it's probably my favorite Blue Moon to date."

"Pours a hazy orange-gold with a finger of fizzy head that quickly subsides to just a film. Slight whiff of wheat/straw on the nose. Taste is bright, with plenty of orange peel and a little vanilla and Belgian spice. Taste is short-lived though; thin and one dimensional. I remember this being a pretty refreshing beer on tap, but there's a slick artificial sweetness this time that's kinda ruining things. Decent beer at best - works ok in the summertime in lieu of anything else."

"This beer may be spiced and all that jazz... too much hype for this craft brew. It's very flavorful but not in a great way. On top of that it's expensive. It's really not that good to the point where I would not recommend it. I certainly see no resemblance to wheat beer which is funny because it says on the bottle that it's unfiltered and Belgian style. Save yourself the trouble and get leff or hoegaarden."

"The Belgian White is the only Blue Moon that I know. It's one of my favorite beers because of it's distinctive character. When I have a taste for it there's no brew I know that's as satisfying. But it's not a beer that I want to drink everyday–too much character. Possibly I'm overrating it because of limited experience with other brews of this type. On the other hand, I've rated it low enough so that I have plenty of room to rate something else much higher, if and when . . . ."

"I love how the majority of the overly complex negatives reviews mention Coors as the maker of this beer. In sorry was I using two many words with over 6 letters in a row for you smucks to understand? This beer is simple, easy drinking. Of course it can not be compared to an import wit beer, because its not, and not meant to be. If you can find an import for $14 for a 24 box then by all means be my guest and go search. If you want to have a decent wit beer introduction or experience and don't want to pay $4 fr a bottle, then his is an excellent choice. Easy drinking, and smooth."

"Pours a tangerine color. Tiny head fades almost immediately. No lacing. A lot of carbonation. Citrusy wheat smell. Goes down smooth with a light fruity finish. Pretty decent flavor for a common beer. It's watered down but not bad. Overall it's a go-to domestic beer. If there are no craft options, I'd go with a blue moon."

"Overall, it’s okay. I am impressed it is from Coors, but needless to say I can tell it is from Coors. I bet this is much better with the orange, but I wanted to review the beer itself. This beer really just has a fake taste to it which I did not enjoy too much. I would recommend this to anyone who is not a craft beer drinker and wants to broaden their horizons. CHEERS!"
"Overall: This beer is trying desperately to be something it is not. The fancy smancy spiciness is just killing its ability to be considered drinkable. Underneath my gag reflex I was able to sense that this is indeed a wheaty beer looking for respect. I would drink this regularly if not for the added spiciness."

"I have had this brew many times in the past of course, both in a bottle and on draught. Actually it has been a while and tried it again this past Saturday night. Date on bottle was ""Jun1013"" so it was pretty fresh. Poured in one of my favorite glasses, a 14 ounce Vikings glass at 36 degrees F from my beer cooler in our home bar. (Appearance) Pours a hazy orangish/yellow in color with a 1-finger foamy white head with some lacing. (Smells) Of wheat and grains with orange peel and spice. (Mouthful) Very pleasant with a full-bodied feel with good carbonation. Very easy to drink with no bitter aftertaste. (Overall). This is a great spring-fall brew, especially in the summer. Very easy to drink and never be disappointed with a Blue Moon."

"Pretty tasty beer! It is the best one from the Blue Moon label (minus Grand Cru) that you see floating around in 12/24 packs. It isn't terribly exciting, but the citrus undertones are noteworthy. A nice treat that is worth enjoying--especially on a hot summer day."

"I used to like Blue moon a lot. Definitely good with orange on draft.. agree that it's a good gateway beer to craft beer. Definitely good gateway into Belgium beer. However I have tasted far superior beers and would not recommend. Although it's not the worst beer you will ever drink."

"O: This is a great beer in terms of availability, ease of drinking, and price.  It's a good beer in terms of flavor and popularity.  And it's a poor beer in terms of being a true micro brew. Haters are gonna hate, you can complain all you want that this is not true to its style or its mass produced, be a beer snob if you want. This is an enjoyable beer that is easy to get a hold of, it's not the best in the world but it does the trick for me"

"The taste is a bit watered down but the aromas come through on the palate. Orange and tangerine set to the front while coriander and light malt finishes. Very refreshing and tasty this Witbier stands strong for an American macro brew."

"O: Overall a decent beer for the price , I do like the spicey taste and silky feel around tongue."

"The main thing that differentiates this beer is a pleasantly ""toasty"" taste. It's pretty good stuff. I wouldn't choose it if there were a bunch of craft beers available, and I'd probably drink Hoegaarden instead if they had it, but it's a pleasant above-average beer with some unique characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is nice and mild, with plenty of wheat and spice (coriander). I get a definite citrus-orange tone, despite my adding no orange wedges as many bars and restaurants do with this brew. Not sure if this orange infusion is real or artificial, but Blue Moon remains a drinkable beer, and a definite ""gateway"" towards real craft beer."

"O: A satisfying sessionable wheat beer. There are a lot of wheat beers I would choose over this one if given the choice, but this beer has the benefits of being easy to find, and costing less than most micro-brews. I can't find much to be excited about with this beer, but I can't find much too complain about either. I definitely think that a slice of orange or even lemon makes it a more satisfying drink, but then, I'm just a big fan of citrus in general."

"Comments: Received as a gift so wrote up a review. I've had this beer on tap before, it's a decent last resort if I am not in the mood for a light beer but nothing craft is available. It's ok, but this bottle really had nothing going on beyond the wheat and orange, no witbier spices to speak of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: i had half of the beer ""pure"" and the other half with an orange slice as garnish, and then even dropped it inside the glass. the slice didnt improve the flavor, so for me the slice was a non significative factor to take into account."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint: glass. Pours a nice cloudy semi-transparent straw with really no head, but limited lacing. Smells of wheat and orange. Tastes of wheat with a slight orange flavor. Beer is overcarbonated, but very drinkable, with more flavor than most mass produced beers for still having a light body. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
"O - Always a treat and never gets old. Of witbiers I've had, it's a little better than Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat and is topped only by Bell's Oberon."

"This beer is perfect on a warm summer day, but refreshing even in these colder months. Food recommendations include Thai food or spicy chicken dishes, and while it's delicious on it's own, I don't recommend it as a session beer, as the flavors tend to mute and weaken if you nurse it too long. Cheers!"
""
"Best described as a Belgian Wit made by a company that never actually tried one -- just read a little bit about them in other books. Like if the Cold War was going on and Romania tried to brew one, based soley on reputation and what they could discover in libraries. It's kiinndda in the style, but it's a really bad stab at it."
""
""
""
""
"Served cold Blue Moon Belgian White in a glass with an orange slice at my favorite local mom & pop pizza restaurant. Hard to tell under florescent lighting, but I would say it looks cloudy with a pale gold color and a white lace. Definable characteristics would be a smooth wheat rich thickness, with a kick of coriander spices and plenty of citrus. I’ll be honest in that I enjoyed the orange slice more, mostly because I find the soapy taste of coriander over powering. If you like citrus wheat beers this would be a good one to try at least once."

""
"Not nearly as refreshing and interesting as the other big name in the witbier game. One of the better BMC products though. I could definitely see a slice of orange upping the drinking experience of this beer. Cold and from the bottle > warmer and from a glass."
""
""
""
"O - A good go-to beer if your high school buddies are back in town and you want to kill a few pints and catch a stiff buzz. Not something I would sit down and savor. As with all beer from colorado, if it warms up on you, dump it and pour another as its true flavors will become prominent. Sticking some fruit in your pint will save this crappy Belgian knockoff as well."
""
""

""
"If Blue Moon was the only beer on Earth, I'd be quite content."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hmmm - so so. Streaks ahead of other macro offerings in terms of character, but doesn't stand up to genuine Belgian wits. Looks OK, but the flavour and aroma are unbalanced - too much orange/spice relative to the malt and yeast. The sweetness doesn't improve things either. A decent if flawed effort - I'd have this again if there was nothing else going. However it's nothing special. No need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, orange-yellow coloring with a fluffy, light, bright white head. Aromas of citrus and bready yeast, light and balanced, but nothing special sticking out to me. Flavors are bready, with a clove spicing and citrus highlight. Well blended, but the carbonation and spicing makes it slightly sharp in mouth. Fruity, effervescent aftertaste that is bordering on overly sweet. Frothy, carbonated finish. The flavors just don't hold up enough against the light, carbonated body. Meh."

"Solid beer that I find myself in the mood for from time-to-time. I love hitting up the local bar for dollar blue moons. GREAT deal!"
"For a mass-produced beer, Blue Moon is a solid choice. Although it's far from complex or breathtaking, it's a solid witbier when you're at a restaurant that doesn't have any regular craft beer choices."

"Pours a cloudy deep straw color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of spice, sweet malts, a bit of orange and a little wheat tang. The flavor is mild with sweet malts offset with a bit of orange, lemon, and spice. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Not much of a wit beer, but certainly easy enough to drink if not just a tad on the boring side."

"This offering from Blue Moon pours a shade darker than straw. A one finger head that dissipates quickly can be observed. There is no lacing to be seen as the glass is emptied. The smell may be the best part of this beer as I could detect notes of orange, bread, and grass. Mouthfeel is pretty average with a lot of carbonation. The taste is very smooth, mostly wheat, without much of the orange that can be smelled. This would be an excellent session beer as it is very drinkable."

"Pours a golden orange in color with one finger of the whitest head I have ever seen. Leaves very trace amounts of lacing. Smells of orange peel, Lemon, And a heavy amount of wheat. Tastes very orange like. If somebody would have poured this into a glass for me and told me it was a light orange juice I would have believed them. The mouthfeel is a MASSIVE knockout punch of wheat. The wheat dominates and it loses the orange flavor. Overall, I don't like wheat ale's, But this is a good summer beer that I'm sure anybody could easily drink."
""
""
"Overall, I try, as I'm sure many of you do, to avoid mass-produced beers. But this was not that bad. Upsides to to this beer were the smell and mouthfeel, but it was severely lacking in the taste department. I am sure that this is not the last time I have a Blue Moon, and i certainly will not turn one down if offered. cheers!"

"Overall, a somewhat bland flavor in comparison to the aroma. Very drinkable, fairly refreshing beer."
""
"I think some beer snobs are quick to dismiss Blue Moon because it's a mass market, Coors brew. However, on tap I find it to be a flavorful beer that stands out in the witbier crowd. That extra orange flavor is really great and is definitely aided by adding some fresh squeezed orange. It works in the winter as well as the summer. Out of the bottle I'm less than impressed for some reason or another. The spices get in the way of the smoothness."
"Pours a murky orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, yeast, and some citrus peel aromas. Taste is of malt, grain, citrus peel, and spices. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer for what it is and pretty easy to drink as well."

"So far, my favorite beer. The color is a cloudy orange and you can see some white in it. The head is beautiful and dissipates in just the right amount of time. The smell is very light and the aroma isn't overwhelming with alcohol. You can smell a bit of the citrus. Orange slice isn't required, but definitely addes to the taste. You can squeeze it or just let it drop in a gradually absorb itself in the beer. The taste was very light on my tongue. Very smooth going into my mouth and the citrus hint comes out. I didn't have to force it down like with some beers. It glides down. Overall a great beer with great taste. If you're more of a social drinker and like wines or mixed drinks, this is definitely a beer you should try."

"Gold yellow light red in color with fluffy white 2 finger head. heavy in feel and overall, taste is good and refreshing. has lost it self over time though. used to have a more complex taste. now has a taste of big business. still a good belgian but not as good as it once was . but boy is it smooth."

"I still like this beer and will claim it as my gateway beer over Rolling Rock--unless pushed. While Rolling Rock is a cleanly brewed beer, it lacks a the craft quality to really serve as a gateway beer. However, between my lack of knowledge and the state of beer in the early 1990s, I think I can be forgiven."

"solid, all day go to beer, very flavorful, good aroma and texture. this beer appears a shade of hazy orange. not sure that it is exactly to style guidelines but is great just as it is. I like this beer best on tap, as I do most beers, but no need for the orange slice, it just gets in the way of emptying the glass and it already has good citrus notes from the orange peel"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured a cloudy yellow, with a half-finger white head that dissipated quickly, leaving no lacing. Scents of yeast, band-aids and slight citrus notes. Flavors of yeast, wheat malt, oats and a slight hint of spices. Mouthfeel is rather undercarbonated for the style and slightly slick. It's the best macro brew offering available everywhere, but it's not craft, and it certainly can't compete with the craft witbiers and hefeweizens of the world."

"This is really not a witbier. Either BeerAdvocate has labeled it incorrectly or Coors Brewing Co aka Blue Moon Brewing Co has mistaken it for a true Witbier. Where is the orange peel? It is a garnish on the glass. Where is the corriander? Non-existent. If you're going to make a Coors Light Wheat, just call it Coors Light Wheat. Marketing, I know, but come on. I guess I'm not the ideal person Coors is marketing this beer towards. The color and the look of the beer is ok. It doesn't have the cloudy wheaty punch to it though. It looks rather translucent. I find this beer rather bubbly and overcarbonated too. This is a below average beer that is below average for the style. Sometimes, it's your only option."

"Pours a cloudy orange-gold, with two fingers of white head. Smell is very sweet, with orange, coriander and hints of other fruits. Taste matches the smell, lots of sweetness, orange and coriander. The finish is extremely sweet, with mild bitterness. Overall a pretty decent witbier. If it wasn't made by coors it probably be rated much more highly."

"A great beer to have with a meal, or to sit back and drink a 12 pack with a couple friends."

"M&D: as the beer is approaching the BB date, I suppose the freshness, or the lack of it, plays a part in an overall mediocre performance. Spiciness and fruity undertones are both weak, making me feel that this perhaps can be classified as “American Wheat Ale” instead of the Belgian style Witbier? Well, classification is academic only, but I wouldn’t mind trying it again if it was fresher next time."
"pours thick and cloudy dull yellow into a hefe glass with an orange peel on the side, medium white head. smells like fruity yeast, some spice, and pale malts. the yeast aroma is overpowering and a bit off though. flavor is quite fruity and zesty from the yeast. lemons, orange peel, and some herbs are there, also some mild tartness at the end. feel is fine, if a little heavy from all the suspended sediment in there. good carbonation and a medium body. overall this beer isnt as good as it used to be. its kind of weighted down and funky in the wrong ways. has refreshing properties, but there are infinitely better choices."

"Overall – This is a solid brew all around. Good not just for summertime but for anytime, Blue Moon is an excellent “micro” which is brewed by a macro. I’m honestly impressed that Coors came up with such a product, but I even like Coors as a macro product. I would recommend this beer to anyone, and I would drink it anytime. This is a good crossover beer for those unfortunate folks who have not yet discovered craft brewing, as it isn’t too much of a system shock from your standard macro brew, but it is certainly different and unique. Good representation of the witbier style, I love it."

"One of my favorite beers next to Newcastle Brown Ale. What I really enjoy about this beer is the taste. It has ALOT of flavor. The orange hint and wheat taste is what I really enjoy. If you pour it into a glass the color is really pretty and very orange. Overall a good brew by Coors."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very average witbier, with ""average"" not implying that it is bad. It's definitely drinkable. Obviously Blue Moon gets some (and deserves some) criticism for hiding the fact that it is a Coors product, but this beer is not awful. At the very least, it may inspire some segment of the population to seek out other witbiers and other styles."
""
""
""
""
"A decent witbier, if something of a caricature of the style. This was a beer that was, back in the day, one of my first divergences from your generic mass-marketed schlock, so I salute it in that regard. It still makes a serviceable fallback if nothing more appealing is around."

"I like this beer on tap if it's available although the bottled version is good too. Although I much prefer true Belgian wheats like Hoegarten or Blanche de Bruxelles, this is a great domestic offering. Very drinkable and one of the very few decent beers offered from the Big 3."

"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is manly made up of wheat with a little bit of coriander and pepper, as well as a little bit of orange peel. The flavor has a mix of coriander and orange peel, with some wheat thrown in as well. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing too exciting, but not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: This isn't really a traditional Belgian style wheat beer. The characteristic yeast flavors just are not present. It is however as well mannered wheat beer that resembles American versions, and does a fine job at it. The flavors are all mellow and work together. This doesn't sparkle, but it does go down easy with some nice flavors and aromas along the way. Not bad for a large-scale production beer."

"Pours a hazy orange colour beer with a two finger head, quickly gone. Some orange on the aroma. Taste is fruity, of oranges of course, sweet but only enough. Medium thickness, average carbonation, high drinkability. I wish my flight was delayed a bit more."

"Didn't know what to expect when I poured into a standard tumbler. Orange zest, some bread, and some more orange on the nose. Mango, Orange peel, lemon zest and zero alcohol presense picked up by the palate. Easy to drink and cheap. Not a bad summer beer and wouldn't mind having a few during a bbq or a day at the lake."

"I have been drinking this beer for years and have always enjoyed it. It has the lightness and refreshing qualities of a true light beer, but it has real flavor and a little kick at 5.4%, though not much. Some people will say this is a summer only brew, but it is 70 degrees in my house right now on a cold March night, so drink away...far away."

""
"The orange brings out the flavor even more. Not the best beer in the world, but a very pleasant beer for the summer."
"O: For beer produced by Macro brewer (Coors) Blue Moon is awesome. This said, it is dummied down compared to beers of this style produced with larger flavor profiles. The best thing about Blue Moon is that it is always there in a pinch at a restaurant with a limited selection of beers and on a hot summer day when I am doing summer yard chores. Also, its sweetness and orange flavor make it a approchable entry level beer for those transitioning from the common fizzy corn colored stuff that dominates the land. Cheers!!"

"o - definitely an easy drinker but doesn't offer much else. this was one of my gateway beers into craft. if nothing else, it's a decent, cheap beer."

"O: I’ve had this beer a ton but never reviewed it until now. I’ve always like how easy it went down and the light citrus flavor."

"Best choice if there is nothing else to choose from."
"Light bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is very drinkable (as a witbier should be). The body is surprisingly decent for a BMC product and does a good job in allowing the flavors to come out. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but does this mainly in the background which really helps both in not hindering the flavors as well as not detracting from the experience of this beer."

"Overall this is easily the best beer I have ever had that is MADE BY A MACRO COMPANY. I think that because this beer is ubiquitous, crafted pretty well, and an extremely easy drinking beer it deserves some respect. I appreciate Blue Moon but would never buy it unless at a restaurant or bar with a very limited selection. This has been on the market for a long time and other companies like AB has tried to break into the craft beer world, but in my opinion this is the best effort by a major company. Bravo Coors!"

"Pours a cloudy orange/yellow with a thin non-lasting white head. No lacing whatsoever. Aroma is of citrus and damp hay. Taste is vile, drain pour coming up! Too much bitter citrus spice!

""

"Overall, this is a good beer to stat drinking to transition from mass production to crafts. Or i will drink this at an occasion where options are limited.

No aftertaste to it makes it one of my favorite choices."

"Bought a 22oz bottle and poured into a tall wheat glass. Deep orange with a short lived soapy head. Aroma mostly of sour wheat and a touch of citrusy sweetness. Great orange flavor, smooth and wheaty. Adding an orange slice with the peel really activates this beer chemically. It becomes brighter tasting and spicier."
"Pours a thick foggy orangey gold, generous and fizzy head, not much lacing at all. Very wheaty and citrusy scent. Crisp and smooth feel, not too watery. Wheat body with citrus. Nice bite to it. Definitely works well with an orange piece, brings out natural spices causing a fairly intense kick"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good beer, made better by the fact that you can get it almost anywhere. I feel like it is given some poor reviews due to the fact it is made by Coors. Who says they can't make a good beer? I was very impressed and am not surprised that it is so popular, it has good flavor and the reinforcement of a large corporation."

"O: not exactly up to the standards of a normal witbier, but slightly acceptable to me"
"A good economic beer. Thus far is my favorite domestic beer (US) that I have tried. I found it similar to belgium beers I have tried such as chimay or duvel. Those of course were much higher quality, but this beer does have that belgium ale feel to it which is a great buy for an economic beer. I recommend this beer."
"Decent wit. I don't care for Hoegaarden, it doesn't seem wheat(y) enough for me for this style that is not my go to. I really like the breadiness and citrus notes of this beer, and it is a good fallback for when nothing else is available in a dive, for sure. The price is good too on a budget. Good thing for wits is that I am starting to see more of them, though it's certainly not my favorite style, not by a long shot."
"Light bodied and overall, watery. Drinkable because it is so crisp. It has gotten worse lately...used to be better, though still not great. Drinkable, but I wouldn't imbibe in it simply because my taste buds and liver would like to spend their efforts elsewhere."
"Dang good beer...light tasting...with a big punch of flavor somehow...this one makes women happy too!"
"O: It's not bad. Decently flavorful and definitely very drinkable. Not something I would go out of my way to buy, but no major complaints."
"M: The feel matches, much more than other white beers I've had, the taste and smell nearly perfectly. The best quality of this beer."
"Overall this is an average beer. There is nothing that sticks out to me that I truly enjoyed of the beer. It wasnt bad, but not great either."
"O: a drinkable middle of the road brew, i frequently get it when im at a restaurant with a bad craft selection, decent enough"
"As I said... i thought I wouldn't give it another chance, but I did and it was worth it. For me, it was all about having the right amount of citrus... as well as patience... It's something that grows on you."
"Overall: When at a bar or restaurant and there is no good craft beers this is a good option. It's not overwhelming by any means. A little water downed it seems nut not bad at all. Cheers!"
"Overall- Great beer. This became my go-to beer this summer. The orange flavor compliments the beer perfectly."
"O: Surprisingly decent beer that I first enjoyed in Louisville in 2005. A good safe fallback when nothing more interesting is offered. Enjoyable and I will have again."
"O – Could use a bit more brightness up front (although I guess that’s why they drop a citrus slice in the glass… still would have liked to have seen it in the beer and not in the adjunct), and balanced a shade too sweet. Overall though, I have to say that it was better than I expected when I sat down to rate the glass."
"RJT"
"Not impressed one iota. Can't believe my scores given for the on-tap version were so kind."
"O - Not too bad considering the company its coming from. A good fall back beer when nothing else better is available."
"This is a dumbed-down version of a witbier (really? A witbier?) that makes me think of the flavor of a filtered American pale wheat ale with orange syrup added. Awful."
"Anyway, the stuff looks good from the start. Nice and cloudy pale yellow with a decent frothy head that hangs around. The smell wasn't bad, but I do not like the smell of imitation apricot extract. Imitation or not, that's how it smells. On top of that, there was a mild spiciness. There is a lot of cracker in the taste, definitely not a smooth, balanced crackery taste either. I can see why people drink it with orange, like with so many American wheat beers, it's to get that taste out of the mouth! Hops didn't make an appearance."
"Poured a golden, orange color. Hazy, no foam. Pours syrupy, thick. Aroma is off-putting, a hint of metal? Taste is off -putting as well and there’s a dull finish. The carbonation is present but it’s fizzy, overly-carbonated like an orange soda. I’m thinking Orange Crush without the carbonation and the sweetness dialed down a bit. The beer gave me a headache by the time I finished it. Really, it’s a mockery of the style, and with better options available there’s absolutely no reason why anyone should drink it. The sacrifices I have made!"
"a fair bit of additives I'm thinking but it kinda works for it, I drank a few of these in Miami and Vegas but at home in a cold climate I doubt I'd bother all that often"
"Dr: Drinkable enough. It's better on draught, but not by much. It's sad that a beer requires an orange to taste better. The price is crap on draught for the quality, but a bit better from the bottle. Only recommended for extremist fanatics of the style."
"I’ve had this plenty of times, but this was my first time rating it. I had nothing bad to say about it for the first half, but the last half was quite disappointing. Much better than the Summer Honey Wheat, though."
"Overall, it's a weak translation of a Belgian classic. For a Coors brand its really good, but for a witbier it leaves a lot to be desired."
"I've had this beer many times and I've finally given up on it. It often needs fruit to enhance it and I never liked that, anyways here's the score. A: average orangish light brown S: has a good citrus smell strong but not overpowering M: light beer mouthfeel nothing too much mainly watered down T: the taste is very fruity, especially if you take it with the fruit on the rim. A little over the top with the fruity flowery taste. O: a lot of ado about nothing, watery poorly flavored brew. Much prefer their their Honeymoon brew."
"Overall: I know its a macro brew beer but it is very good. Incredibly drinkable crisp and refreshing."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Overall I found this beer to be over-hyped. There are many people out there that swear by this brand and that is respectable. It is not awful but it is not for me. Like I said this is fine if it is a seasonal brew... the taste and feel is a bit too heavy for warm weather."
"Honestly wasnt sure what I was gonna get when I ordered this beer. Heard the name so I thought to try it. The appearance was shocking,looked like dirty soapy water,but thats good for this kind of beer?. I smelled orange,because thats what was served with it,and continued to influence the beer when I flicked it off the glass. The taste was fruity sweetness,but flat too,even though it seemed to have a descent bubbly top. I felt like I was drinking a cocktail more than a beer. Overall not a bad experience and was worth trying so I know to avoid again in future."
"Blue Moon is strong flavored yet thirst quenching. Right On!"
"Overall, I think it's not something I would drink on a regular basis on a hot summer day. I think there's other witbier beers that has better balance. Having said that, I think this is decidedly better better than Pale Moon and Honey Wheat beers."
"Belgian beer is my favorite type of beer, so I thought I would give this a try. The taste didn't remind me at all of any of the qualities I normally like in Belgian beer. It instead has that generic taste of a corporate macro beer. It's possible that this beer might be tolerable in a shandy, but it's just a little bit too bland for me to enjoy on its own."
"Summary - Very refreshing. I don't have it often, but when I do I enjoy it. I find Coors to be pretty blah, but Blue Moon's Belgian White is one of my favorite Witbiers."
"Sidenote: I have to stay humble here for one reason. I remember the way this beer used to taste before I fell into the craft scene full bore. It was so different than most of the Macro stuff I had had before that it was one of my gate way brews. I know this review might sound like I am flaming this beer, But with all of the beautiful witbiers out there it is a shame that they don't get the recognition that this beer has . So I guess what I am saying drink what makes you happy and if someone drinks something different don't talk down to them like you are better than them . This is only my 60th review and I have alot to learn. Every beer has it's place and time whether it be a Simpler times or Pliny the Elder. The old expression holds true you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink."
"O: Not offensive at all, which is an accomplishment for a macrobrewer. A very refreshing summer beer. A good baseline of what is required of a witbier."
"taste a bit creamy and reminds me a bit like a mild hef."
"O-Boring. Not very good. But not as terrible as many make it out to be."
"It was not very smooth or did not have alot of drinkability. Not something I would tailgate with or purchase on my own but I would not turn it down if it was offered to me."
"O- I was really disappointed with this beer, because I like the others of its brand. But this beer was not at all what I thought it'd be like. It was fresh, and well refrigerated; and even with all that said, I still can't say anything positive about it from a personal opinion. It's good quality beer for the price, and it's worth a try. I know a lot of people who drink Blue Moon Belgian White and love it. But this is just not for me. I don't claim this to be a bad beer, but it's not something I'd buy again."
"I am glad I tried this. But I won't go back."
"Blue Moon was the beer that introduced me to ""alternative beers"" (I won't use the word craft since it is a Coors beer :-). I have to be honest, I LOVE this beer. I love the crispness of witbier, and the orange flavor is wonderful. For a while this was all I drank, but then had to mix some things up with red beers, lagers and other whites. I am not a huge fan of Coors american adjunct, but I think they hit the nail on the head with Blue Moon!"
"I don’t know that I would ever seek out this beer. This is another beer that is relative to the situation. If I had to choose between a Blue Moon or a Bud Light, it would obviously be the Blue Moon. I also found that women gravitate towards beverages garnished with fruit. If you ever order one up for your lady, make sure they put an orange slice in it."
"This beer was probably one of the first 50 beers I had ever tried. I gave this one a try simply because I wanted to have something new. When I ordered my first glass of it the guy asked me if I wanted an orange wedge in it, I said sure because everyone else at the bar had one. I'm assuming he asked because I was a guy and perhaps ""guys don't put fruit in their beer"". Anyway though, I got the glass tossed the wedge in and gave it a look. It's a cloudy golden color with a foamy white head on top. The lacing is actually decent on this beer, I was surprised. The smell of the beer was sweet and now full of orange zest. The taste of the beer was refreshing and citrusy, makes a really nice summer beer for some people. The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly carbonated. Overall Blue Moon has never been a terrible beer in my opinion but since it's from Coors I do have a bit of an issue buying it. If it's free I'll drink it but I really don't feel the need to go out and purchase these with my own money unless it's all that's available."
"A decent American hefe that is refreshing and quite drinkable, especially on a hot summer day. A very nice effort by Coors, and a beer that has become mainstream and consistently good."
"Alot of places started serving this so I thought I would give try it. It has a nice smooth taste, it has a good feel and very easy to drink. By far the best overall Witbier for the money. This beer is easy to drink on a nice summer day by the pool or relaxing at the beach."
"its just ok."
"Not a bad beer. The light feel is enjoyable, especially on hot days."
" "
"O - This beer can be enjoyable on a hot summer day or a quality choice when you're at Applebees/Chili's/Whatever and Blue Moon is the only beer offered besides basic BMC brews. Otherwise there are plenty of beers I'd rather crack open before this one."
"I am a summertime dedicated wheat beer fan. Yes, I add lemon. I know purists will frown, but it adds a zest which can be tart with fresh lemons or sweet if the lemon has aged and mellowed. Anyway, this is a review of a Coors product, Blue Moon, which you can get anywhere. It’s not my all time favorite wheat, as Adolf Coors and company add quite a bit of spices to this brew, but it does make a nice change of pace within a wheat beer rotation. Blue Moon has a nice head, remember to swirl in the yeast! The brew is smooth drinking summer wheat with a good bit of body and more flavor than most wheat beers."
"D - Overall, this was a good drink and can definitely hold its own against other craft brews; kudos to Coors for making this enjoyable beer, why can't that make more beer like this?"
"Poured into a glass. The head was decent, but died sort of quickly and was fizzy. The color is a cloudy orange, and is semi-attractive. The fizzy head reflects the mouthfeel, which is light, crisp, and active, with orange aromas and notes. The beer gives off a great smell of orange, which was its most remarkable characteristic, but seems too light and empty in almost all regards for me to recommend it. Compared to other European Wheat Ales it feels void of real density and the flavors seem forced and artificial. The sweetness is tasty, but I don't see myself being able to drink more than a couple of them. However, in the category of fruity, citrusy, sweet beers, this is the one I would choose."
"O: I have always enjoyed Blue Moon and still do. It is quite clean and refreshing. Very suitable for a BBQ and any warm day."
"For those who aren't opposed to buying a Coors product, this is a solid offering and a great beer to buy if you are looking for something that's refreshing and/or on the cheaper side."
"Overall: I don't understand why some people give rave reviews for this beer. It's not a horrible beer by any account, but for a ""craft beer"" it's not noteworthy in any respect. The only reason why I would order one again is if I had a craving for an orange slice to go with my beer."
"Alot of carbonation, but still quite drinkable, Blue Moon is a decent in-between beer (more palatable than most macros, but not going to appease most craft-fans), but nothing special."
"O: While there are much better wits out there, Blue Moon is a good American interpretation of the style. Aside from the macro-like flavor at the end, this is a solid beer."
"I gotta admit, I really enjoy the ""Blue Moon"" movement for the most part (with the exception of their Pumpkin-version). Their brews are quaffable and the flavors are mild and easy going. I'd have this one again, and I will for sure revisit this one on draft."
"Poured a cloudy golden yellow with a quick disappearing head. Smells of orange peel and coriander... tastes like carbonated water with a faint hint of citrus...and some chemicals.. boring. I'd rather have a Hoegaarden... Originally reviewed this beer out of a bottle and gave it a D+ rating... the can is a tiny bit better."
"I had high hopes for this beer since it was recommended by many people. It's a very mediocre whit in my opinion. I agree with others that this seems very much like a macro lager just in whit form. It's appearance is fine enough. It didn't have much smell to speak of, only slight hints of fruit and spice...slightly metallic (?). Taste was a big 'meh' for me...it just tasted stale to me. All the right flavors were there for this style, just completely watered down and subdued. This is a very poor example of this style and should be avoided in my opinion."
"Upon first pour, I was excited, thinking I'd pegged this beer all wrong. But the taste instantly reminded me why I don't like it. Such a dull and uninspired version of the style. It's a shame to think so many Americans are turned on to witbiers by this thing. They have no idea what they're missing out on."
"Better than what most BMC beers can throw out but still a average at best example of style, all the parts are there but don't seem to mesh well into the whole and the beer seems dark and earthy through out."
"O: It was ok. Probably one of the best beers that Coors makes, but its not saying much. There will probably always be something available that I would prefer to drink."
"Started out good but it disappointed me at the end. I know a lot of people drink this regularly but I probably couldn't. I'll drink it if it's the only thing available but I'm not going out of my way for it."
"D: Maybe not the best Belgian wit but always a nice alternative to it macro counterparts/relatives. This beer doesn't lend itself to a lot of nuance or poetic speech but it is a good drinking brew."
"Good stuff."
"Notes: Do yourself a favor, don't add a slice of orange....it doesn't improve the taste."
"On tap at my watering hole, Old Chicago Westminster as part of the Craft Beer Week Mini Tour. Poured a cloudy straw color with a pretty decent white head. Aroma of citrus and wheat. Taste was not too bad at all: malt, citrus, biscuits and no bitterness at all in the end. A decent brew that I have no problem getting/drinking if it's part of a mini tour, a friend buys it, etc."
"Overall not a bad beer but not a good one. Maybe its the style but it seems to lack flavor."
"T- Smooth and comparatively substantial sweet malt. Coriander & citrus peel take the mid palate. Dry-ish powdery yeast takes up the finish."
"Food Pairing: Anything that would go with cola I guess. Pizza, wings, a sandwich. Bar food I suppose."
"Overall - I must confess, I always have a few of these in my fridge. It is fairly inexpensive, available year-round, and very sessionable at 5.4%. When I go to Chili's, I always have 2-3 tall Blue Moons to wash down my meal. Not nearly as complex as many of the micro-brews that I prefer, but a good, solid, impressive macro-brew that is a few steps up from all of the ""commercial beers"" that you see on tv. A great go-to beer, and especially nice to throw back a few after house work or mowing the lawn. A good beer to have in the fridge, not so much for special occasions."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty decent beer, pretty mediocre witbier."
"O: Overall, nothing special here, though it's slightly better than your typical run-of-the-mill mass produced beer. Very drinkable and it isn't at all off-putting. With a nice price tag and its availability in a can, it is certainly not the worst option, but if you're looking for flavor or complexity, look elsewhere!"
"A fair offering for the style and an appropriate party gift."
"This is one of the better beers. One of my favorites."
"Well, this poured a murky orange, cloudy ugly, no head, thin lace, not appetizing. Oh, and there was an orange in it, fun...The smell was of light citrus, oranges, earthy like dirt earthy. The taste was the same, light citrus, faint malts, earthy and grainy. Light bodied, easy to drink, comes off crisp. Overall, im not rating this based on where it was made, this just sucks. It tasted nothing like any witbier or Belgian white ive ever had. Not my cup of tea."
"O. very good summer time beer light with a refreshing feel, only problem its a little to sweet and about two is all i can handle."
"O: It's not bad, not great, and its quite affordable and widely available since its a Coors beer. I certainly don't mind having this on draft at places with a poor beer menu."
"Overall I think this is a good, middle-of-the-road beer, highly drinkable. It's nothing special but I don't think it deserves all the criticisms that it gets just because it's by Coors."
"overall: its like a coors on crack. Its not so bad, especially for free. But nothing id go out of my way to buy."
"overall: i'm not really keen on the taste but it's cool to finally be able to try it. it's gonna be hard to finish this bomber since the taste is not that enticing. the logo on these blue moon bottles is pretty generic and ugly."
"Good, affordable and surprisingly decent showing from Coors."
"Last time I had this, I had it on tap in a restaurant and I don't really care for the orange slice they put in it. I think it just gets in the way and I like the beer just fine by itself. Drinking it on tap though or in a glass, I love the cloudy, orangish look that it has to it. The taste is a mix of wheat and fruit and like I mentioned already, tastes much better in the summer!"
"I remember when this beer hit the streets - people loved that cute little orange slice they served it with. It really introduced the variety of beer to many of my friends. I love the appearance. My girlfriend once had me call Coors over the July 4th holiday because she didn't like the looks of the white sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Coors gave us the thumbs up to drink. Appearance is quite hearty. Pours with a small white head. For me this is a beer to compare other witbiers to. Not the best, nor the worst. The irony here is I drank this beer given to me by my friend ""Porter"""
"Drinkability: it goes down easily, and tastes quite nice, especially in the heat. As I'm usually a fan of german beers, the citrus takes some getting used to."
"O - Very easy to drink and tastes pretty good. If you're going to buy a beer from the macro's, this is a good pick."
"DRINKABILITY: This beer surprised me. I'm as much of a Coors-hater as anyone but this beer wasn't bad at all. It would be a good introductory offering to someone wanting to learn more about craft beer. This is a good ""middle of the summer beer"" and it's easily repeatable all afternoon long."
"This beer will always have a place in my fridge.(it's also my Brothers favorite beer)"
"I must conclude that Wit is just one of the few styles that I really do not care for. This isn't bad, but I'm not more likely to buy one of these or any other Wit over any kind of pale ale."
"Poured a cloudy amber orange color with a good amount of white head on it. Smells sweet, and wheaty. Taste is pretty darn good, sweet citrus flavor. Good light malt body with no hop character at all. Beer is very body and therefore went down smooth and easily. Pretty good tasting beer, easy to drink. Could put down a lot of these in a night."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin and highly carbonated, but not entirely inappropriate. Overall, this pour was better than my recollection and very decent. Can't imagine picking any other BMC product over this one, if nothing else is available."
"Drink - I preferred this beer on draft much more than the bottle. The draft seemed to taste better and it definitely looked much better in the glass. Still a decent beer that is suited for the warmer weather."
"one of my fiancé's favorites, and a pretty decent go-to at restaurants with a less-than-adequate beer selection. this tends to be the ""craft brew"" at most places...along with sam adams boston lager."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a two finger frothy head that retains. Decent carbonation. The pour on this is actually good.. but not much else is going on with this beer. Smell is somewhat musky and soapy but some fruits and earthy grains. Taste is nothing special. Pretty mellow flavor with some citrus fruits and wheat on the palate. Mouthfeel is thin and good carbonation from the tap. Overall this is decent. I always go to it if only macro's are available at restaurants/bars."
"Taste is the same sweet citrus and wheat flavor, not very bitter. Mouthfeel is medium, a bit Decent, it's better than a macro lager but isn't very complex compared to the better Witbiers and Hefeweizens out there. Could be an intro to craft beer for BMC drinkers. I wouldn't buy it again since I can get beers I prefer, like Sam Adams', for the same price or less."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer poured a cloudy orange color. It produced a white head. Head retention is below average. Minimal amount of lacing. The aroma was a balance of wheat, lemon and coriander. The beer was under carbonated and was light in body and was very smooth and sweet. The beer had a slight flavoring of citrus. This beer is okay. Its a good beer to introduce someone to craft beer. Granted Coors makes this beer, but I have to give credit where it's due, its not outstanding, but it is a fair representation of an Witbier."
"Not terrible though"
"Wow, this used to be a favorite beer of mine. I got stuck at a bar with no craft and this was my best option. The ber is yellow ornage with an ok head. No lace. The smell was faint, bready, not offensive. the taste was really underwhelming, with funky, out of balnce flavors. Not very good."
"D: Drinkability is right in the middle, not too light not too heavy. A good summer beer. Go with this if you are going to have 2 or 3."
"D: Good, nice progression of flavor. Refreshing, which is what I wanted right now."
"I can't seem to figure this one out. I keep sipping...maybe that's the problem. It tastes significantly different with different parts of the tongue and at different times of the sampling (ie, the initial taste vs. the aftertaste). It is definitely worth trying at least once for it's complexity and tasty wheatiness."
"Although it was a lot better on-tap, as the taste really came out, and everything else about it was better. A nice beer to start people off with getting into the crafts."
"D: C'mon! This is a sad representative of a Witbier. Why is this a B average on this site?"
"O - very average representation of the style. There are far better wits out there, but this one is everywhere. Id get this again if it was the best thing available. Full flavored, kind of heavy on the palate. It feels and tastes under-developed and somewhat cheap."
"Fairly drinkable. Not too heavy, not too light, wonderful when its warm out. Understandably, I'm probably incredibly biased because I love this style of beer."
"Overall it's a pretty good beer. I liked the color, smoothness and the taste. It was the aftertaste that I liked the least. I was surprised to see it was made by the Coors Company. Much better than their other beers. A little overpriced."
"T: Of all the mass-produced beer out there, this is one of the better ones. It's easy to drink, but it's also got a bit more flavor to it than a lot of the other stuff out there. There's not a ton of flavor here, but there's some wheat, a little lemony citrus twang, and some yeast thrown in. I still think it's funny that they threw ads for this during ""Brewmasters."" Nice try, guys."
"Drinkability is high. I could probably finish a 6 pack on my own with no problem."
"cloudy wheat beer. aromas are high on the citrus, especially the orange. same goes for the taste, lots of citrus/orange. this one has alot more orange taste then what i prefer in a wheat. still a refreshing wheat to drink while eating seafood. drinkability for me may be slightly below the average side because of it's high orange taste, but it's still a good one to have with seafood."
"D: Despite the flaws the 6 pack had dissapeared quickly."
"Pours well and looks nice in a glass, with a dark golden/orange hue with white head. The smell is rather plain and the taste is not particularly complex- strong orange and wheat flavors. I find it to be a bit sweet for my liking- it's a beer I don't mind drinking, but I generally do not seek it out."
"D- Very nice. Love blue moon!"
"A very murky golden straw with minimum head and no retention. The nose is totaly citrus orange with some nice spice, probably corriander. The taste is orange again and very prominent. The mouthfeel is dry but creamy. Overall a decent beer and on a sunny day should be ordered by the pitcher."
"D - Easy drinking, well-balanced, very very sessionable. Great gateway beer for those getting into craft beers (even though Coors produces it)."
"Easy to drink, pretty well balanced, not too heavy, and keeps me from having to drink Bud Lite (or, heaven forbid, go without). That's worth a point or two right there."
"Drinkability - Well, its smooth and light like I mentioned in the mouthfeel so it isn't hard to drink but why bother? This is the kind of by the fire in the winter-time beer to warm you up but its not that enjoyable even in that setting. I felt gassy in-between sips."
"A bar near my university has Blue Moon specials during their happy hour and Im one of many to par take because its such a delicious white ale. It is kinda of heavy alcohol wise and a couple will bring forth the buzz but its a good beer nonetheless.."
"D - I love blue moon and I think it is one of the perfect summer drinks. Great with a light dinner."
"D - Low ABV allows this beer to be highly drinkable, but the lack of flavors keeps it lower for me. Still an easy drinker and I would easily choose a Blue Moon over other BMC."
"Good brew. I'll be getting it again."
"Good beer, considering it's made by Coors. One of the better selections when you're at a small bar without much selection. Other than that, I wouldn't order many of these."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A bit over light bodied with quite a bit of carbonation, it still drinks fairly smoothly. Overall, this is a pretty decent drinkable beer, and I can lay partial credit here for getting me started on craft. That's about the extent of it though, this beer is about average or slightly above average."
"When i poured this beer into a pint glass it has a very thin white head that went away very quickly and the body is a golden orange color. The aroma is light and citrus. The taste is like the smell of citrus and taste some wheat, and some spice on the back of the tongue. It has a average mouth feel and i think it is drinkable anytime of the year."
"i went out for dinner last night and only had about 6 choices of beer to choose from. this being one of them. i tried one called la mon fondat? i think. it wasnt good so i chose this beer. i think ive had a change of heart with this beer. its actually really good. no need for an orange slice!!! smooth and no aftertaste!! with dinner it was surprisingly really good."
"I would drink it again as its very easy on the taste buds but it doesn't have enough flavor to make it better then the Pale Moon."
"Mouthfeel isn't entirely bad, as it has a decent creamy texture initially, but that watery feel and taste just kills any buzz the beer had created previously. Drinkability was ok for a bit, but then quickly spiraled into a disaster. Nasty semi-yeast taste, combined with watery malt is just yucky in the aftertaste. I think the ""belgian yeast"" is hitting near the end, instead of spicing it up near the beginning, which is weird tasting in this case, as it accompanies water and nothing else. The orange also fades much too quickly considering it doesn't have much back up. Solid offering from Coors, but judged by craft, this one falls short."
"First off, Im not much of a fan of gimmicky beers that are more often than not flavored with lime or oranges. This beer by itself pours a light orange, average carbonation, average head beer. It has a natural citrusy taste which is complimented by a nice citrusy aroma of orange peels and malty hops. This is becoming pretty popular for a reason. If you have not tried this brew yet, please do."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties."
"D: VERY Easy to drink - Just leave out the lime/orange. Very easy to drink more than 2 in a ""session"""
"I'd probably order a Bud if I were at a bar that considered this their 'craft brew.' Either that or just walk out. I consider this beer a nice bit of proof that you can't successfully brew the more intricate styles of beer if you only care about the bottom line. It's not a horrible beer, and I've reviewed to my tastes (which is what I try to do, for various reasons), but as far as the style goes, this is a very weak representation. I'll never buy this beer again, but I understand how people could like it. I just want to show them what a real Witbier tastes like!"
"Blue Moon when paired with the right food is an outstanding drink, but it is not something I would want for all occasions."
"This was my gateway beer, and I'm not ashamed to say that. This is by far the best offering that Coors has, and although I won't buy it on a regular basis, it's a decent effort to get the macro drinker to explore other styles, even if the advertising is rather deceitful."
"This brew is the best beer Coors has ever brought to the table. I could see why Smokey had to smuggle this beer across the Mississippi. Yes I just spelled Mississippi while drinking. This beer looks like a golden wheat. Smells like fruity bananas and taste like a wheat beer . The staple of wheat beers. Bell's oberon kicks this beers into last week but you can drink a lot more Blue moon than Oberon. Trust Me!"
"Really like this beer. It is only the second wheat brew I have had but I actually really like this one. It is gold in color but very cloudy. The smell is very nice with wheat and oats. The mouthfeel is great very even and smooth which gives it an superior drinkability!"
"Good witbier, spicy and sweet. Lacks the complexity or depth of flavor that many witbiers bring. Very light in taste but with a fairly creamy body. Still drinkable and decent. Nothing to seek out and nothing to avoid."
"Pours a cloudy gold/orange with a nice white head. Aroma of citrus and lemon peel, some light hints of bannana, some sweet maltiness and light wheat notes. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is light to med body with nice carbonation and crisp mouthfeel. Finishes with some citrus flavors light sweet malt ending with some slight nutty notes. Overall a nice refreshing and easy drinking belgian."
"This is a very solid wheat beer in my book. Pours a cloudy amber with very little head. What head that remains does not stay long, very little aroma, slight orange zest. Good mouthfeel, coats the inside if your mouth very nicely. Flavors of wheat and fruity orange are the most definite. Very drinkable, a good relaxation beer for me."
"This beer is golden cloudy in color, the scent is somewhat weak....but hey it is a SESSION beer BABY!!!!"
"d- overall its a good beer, for the style its pretty average but its very easy to put these down and theyre reasonably priced"
"22 oz chug into my giant snifter (the whole 22 oz at once). Pale cloudy orange-yellow. Not a bad color for the style. Has some yeasty funk in the nose. I am actually pleasantly surprised. I always see people drinking this beer with an orange. I have no idea why. None whatsoever. Witbier needs citrus? No, it doesn't. Taste is refreshing from the wheat. Goes down easy. I am pleasantly surprised by this beer all around. Does it compare with pricier Belgian wits? Nah, but at the half the price, I will probably drink this again sometime."
"Not a bad effort. I think everyone here has had this a least a few times, including myself."
"Beer is thin and sweet up front with a nice finish of some wheat aftertaste to it. The beer is easy going down and one of these fake craft beers that is forced on the masses in great supply. This is probably the first time i've ever had it and for a witbier, it was decent."
"D: Excellent! Very easy to drink and quenches the thirst. Would definitely make a good session beer. I normally drink it with an orange but I did not for the sake of this review. The orange adds a little more flavor and actually seems like it helps with the carbonation."
"mouthfeel is light and the beer is drinkable. very refreshing"
"if anyone needs me, I'll be in the den having another of this beer. enjoy!"
"This is a good beer, simply put, it's a good beer. Whoever rips on it for being made by coors needs to grow up. This beer has a nice cloudy appearance, golden in color. Smells crisp and fruity, like oranges and coriander. Taste is just the same, heavy orange presence, but its balanced out nicely with the wheat, not much hop or malt, but that's okay. It is a well done beer and nothing is unpleasing about it. I could drink it anytime, rain or shine."
"I'll be the first to admit I have this over-rated, but when I first started trying beers this was the first beer I really enjoyed and I still do today!"
"Drinkability - I would consider this beer to be average to slightly above average. It does have some ok qualities as far as ease of drinkability. Would be great in the Summer. It does, however seem a bit ""contrived"". I could still drink a few though."
"Drinkability - Not the best tasting but very drinkable, one of coors better beers but that doesnt mean much."
"D: Smoooth, light, pleasant taste. The ABV is slightly sneaky. Despite the heavy fruit emphasis it doesn't come across too sweet."
"D: My dad brought a case home today....he's already drank eight. There's certainly nothing to stop you from throwing these back, other than the fact that I'm halfway through this one and bored already."
"D: Don't get me wrong of me harshly reviewing this. This is one of the beers that got me into craft beers. Started drinking these in college because the price isn't bad and it's extremely easy to drink. I do keep this in stock for those who are tip toe-ing their way into craft beers."
"Taste, similar to smell, is primarily that of sweet malt, with additional flavors of orange, yeast, and cinnamon. Sweetness of malt lingers along with the cinnamon flavor. It has a crisp carbonation with a substantial, but not thick, body; it's very drinkable."
"Drinkability - I could kick back a couple of these on a summer night with some barbecue. I don't know if I would want more than two or maybe three due to the sweetness."
"Drinkability - Overall it's a tasty beer and it's enjoyable to have a pint every so often, especially if there's just BMC on-tap. While I could drink a lot of this at once, I would eventually grow tired."
"Really quaffable. Aided by the fact that this is on the simple side. Not a hard beer to have several of in a sitting. Sneaky 5.4% at that. For a craft style from a BMC, this is pretty good."
"Blue Moon is great with an orange slice and a glass to drink with dinner. It's good for one or two drinks, but it's not the best to drink all in one sitting. Have to remember it's not really an import, just a Coors product, similar to Bud's Shock Top"
"Drinkability: Yes, but not very many because the sweetness could hurt my stomach. I can see why some people like this beer a lot. It is very good in its category."
"The smell has a bit of clove with sweet malt. High orange presence as I said before. Taste is a very sweet, with a slight bitter finish. A very nice blend. this is a beer you could go thru a six pack and wonder where it went when you were finished."
"Poured a 2"" head which pretty quickly dissipated. Hazy straw yellow in color. Smells like Coors with a little spice added. Not alot of flavor. Corn, grass, spice. Oh come on folks, this is just Coors slightly doctored and rebottled to masquerade as some sort of craft beer, which it isn't. I expected more."
"O: Medium drinkability. Not big deal"
"Hardly any head on this one at all, thin ring of bubbles left, lace with no cling. Color is a cloudy 5 on the SRM chart. Sweet aroma of orange peel, cinnamon, and wheat. Flavors of orange, malt, cinnamon, and pepper. Much more mouthfeel than head, good body. Refreshing, crisp flavor, not heavy, but much better than ""light"" beer. Something new to drink at outings."
"D - Good in the summer. Worth drinking at bars serving only a small selection of domestics."
"It might not be the best Witbier I've ever had, but it's certainly decent and a great session beer, especially on the (relative) cheap."
"D: Not a great beer, but pretty easily drinkable."
"This beer is very drinkable. I can easily down a few of these."
"D- Watery and easy to drink . Nice hins of orange."
"Poured into a pint glass and swirled the bottom third to get the goods. Pours a hazy straw color with some apricot looks as well. Nice bright foamy head. Orange smell dominates with some light malt in the background. Taste is very refreshing. Slightly fruity taste with some bitterness and pepper on the swallow. High carbonation is somewhat distracting. Good drinkability as this could be a great compliment to a hot summer day. I didn't put the orange in as it directs, but I doubt the rating would change."
"D - Very easy to drink and could definitely have another. However, the quality is lacking and for the price tag I wouldn't say its totally worth it. I could find better wits elsewhere that are worth the price. Overall not a bad wit but there are better ones out there whose quality equals their cost."
"I finally decided to try this because I had tried everything else at this bar. I have been told this may actually be the same as Rickard's White (brewed by Molson's), but I wasn't sure if that is true or not. Pours a cloudy yellow colour with thin white head. No real lacing down the glass. Smells of strong clove, mild lemon and orange with the wheat. Overall I think this is similar to Rickard's White, but it seems to have more clove and less of the fruitiness, though I'd need to try them side by side to be sure (I don't care enough to try)."
"Drinkability is pretty high. It's not a terrible beer but is not something I will get if any true crafts are available. Average to decent overall and good for Coors standards."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color, had a fizzy white head that faded fast. The aroma smells of coriander and orange peel. The flavor is sweet, and yet light, like its almost watered down. There isnt much of a belgian yeast flavor from what you would expect from a traditional witbier. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy."
"I always tell the barmaid/bartender to hold the orange and it's good without it. I like it best from the bottle because I've had some funky tasting draft beers. Blue Moon is my current favorite house beer that I keep for friends and I like it as a regular beer and I usually drink it with dinner as it compliments a lot of the foods I like to eat and isn't overpowering or bitter like some IPAs I've had. It's an all-around good beer and it's head and shoulders over a lot of others I've tried. It's got a nice bit of spice, I like the flavor and I like the cloudy wheat beers that I grew accustomed to in Germany."
"Tough beer to review due to the fruit that dominated the aroma and palate. Cloudy, decent head, light lacing. Aromas of citrus and corinader. Feels and tastes a little bit too thin. An easy drinker when you need one."
"I have not tried Blue Moon for 15 years, but yesterday had to drink it on occasion. Pours hazy orange with a large white head. Nose of yeast, citrus fruit with hints of spicy hops and apples. Medium crisp body, with citrus, sweet malt and spicy hops on the palate. Finish is sweet in the beginning then becomes spicy and dry. Surprised and impressed by this brew."
"With a 5.4% ABV Blue Moon is a bit heavy to be sessionable. It's a dumbed down version of the witbier style but I still generally enjoy Blue Moon when I'm in the mood. However, from the can this was just a mess; I'm not sure what happened. I can't imagine wanting to put too many of these away in succession. However I will say that it was pretty tasty with Thanksgiving dinner, and my Busch-drinking family was fairly impressed. As far as macro in a can goes, I can't imagine it gets much better than this."
"overall i'd give it a B"
"You would think this would be a great beer with all the flavors put into it but really it's overwhelmingly average. For one thing, once the head disappears (in about 3 seconds) it looks like an dirty honey/orange drink of some kind. It's not really a bad beer, it just pales in comparison. Especially if had before or after a good beer. It's easy to drink and you could drink several before you know it, but you won't enjoy it very much because it's just blah."
"For a macro product, it is not too bad a copy of a good Belgian white, like Blanche de Bruxelles, but does not quite measure up to their standard."
"D-A beer that I will have occasionally. Very Refreshing"
"mug. The beer is a nice cloudy golden blonde color, just like a Hefeweizen. The smell promises refreshing fruit like tangerine, orange with coreander. The taste is confirming that promise with a pleasant prickliness which is extremely refreshing and thirst quenching. A great beer for the summer. The first one goes down easy, the second just like it. After the third one I call it quits."
"For as much hype as this beer gets, I have to say, I was bit let down to be honest. It was good but wasn't like ""wow"". I tried it with and without orange slices and liked it much more with them. It definitely does bring out the citrus flavor. Without it I found it was a bit bland. I was almost bored with it. This is also my first witbier so I wasn't sure what to expect but I guess I'm not a huge fan of the style. Fairly low carbonation and the same goes for flavor in my opinion."
"Nothing exciting or offputting from the mouthfeel, and is drinkable to a certain extent, however, the orange can be a bit overwhelming if one were to venture into multiples of this beer."
"I had this beer once before and don't recall it being anywhere near this watery. Perhaps I'll try it again sometime."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Not terribly complex, but crisp and subtle enough to make it interesting."
"D - Easy going, crisp and refreshing witbier. Would recommend it."
"Drinkability- a very dull beer. I think the overwhelming orange attempts to mask the inferiority of everything else."
"I had this beer at a sports bar. I had never had a Blue Moon before. So I thought I'd give it a try. The beer came with an orange slice. I had never seen that before. Usually wheat beers in North America come with a slice of lemon (which is an abomination... in my opinion). But the orange really set it apart. As far as the smell, the slice of orange really threw me off. So, I removed the orange and took a sniff of the beer. Had a lot of citrus. I took a sip. I got a lot of strong citrus flavor up front and not a lot of wheat on the back end. When I added the orange, I soon realized that was a big mistake. The orange simply masked the flavor of the beer and made it way too sweet for my palate. Next time I have this beer, it will definitely be without the orange. All in all, I'd say this is a decent choice when you're at a sports bar eating a basket of chicken strips while enjoying the big game."
"This is a refreshing beer and one I end up getting a lot in restaurants when its the closest thing they have to a craft beer. Not one I would seek out and purchase otherwise."
"Pours a very murky apricot-orange color. White head and a bit of lacing. Too murky as it is completely opaque and full of haze. Nose is light orange citrus with a tad bit of spicing and a bit of light wheat. Taste is wheat, orange, and sugar; definitely quite a bit cloying, which carries over into the feel. Drinks well enough, but this is a surprisingly heavy witbier."
"Blue Moon requires an orange to meet its full potential, but that's part of the fun. It makes it a treat, rather than just a beer. This is a great one to give to somebody who doesn't like beer. I'm surprised to find out Coors makes it. Coors is disgusting."
"Drink- It was pretty hard to put this one down. I'm not a fan of Blue moon. Its not bad but just not my favorite."
"In my opinion, while this isn't a great beer, it is decent and easy to find. One of the best macros you can buy."
"Pours out a cloudy orange tinted white color with a finger and a half head that fizzes away rather quickly and leaves little lacing. Smell has hints of orange but is mostly unassuming. Taste wise it is a crisp brew, not very strong on orange but coriander is evident. Finish has some decent wheat flavor but is watery. Drinkability is good, feel as though I could easily have a few more. Overall a good offering from a macro-brewery, but you'll find better witbiers out there."
"The appearance of this beer is a very cloudy pale orange color with a nice finger of white foam. The aroma is skewed a bit due to the presence of the orange in my glass, so clearly I smell that. In addition there is the distinct aroma of sour hops, coriander, and light caramel. The flavor however is rather astringent for my liking the faint sourness doesn't help matters, now I know why the orange is given with it, because it helps cut through the astringency. I also believe that I taste some cilantro/garden salad-like flavor that is really off-putting. It feels fairly syrupy in the mouth, but there is still an appropriate amount of carbonation. It isn't too hard of a beer to drink, not a bad option if your choices are limited to BMC."
"Drinkability- Reasonably average alcohol level. Reasonably light in body and texture. Easy to swallow. I do like these, and it's about the only halfway decent beer on tap @ Chilis (besides Stella), so I know I'll be swallowing many more gallons of this stuff in my lifetime, though it will never be my first, or tenth, pick."
"I started drinking this when I was 18, I thought it was cool and I got the perception that is was a good beer. Unknowing to me it was a coors product. Since then I have had many better beers in general and of the same style. Blue Moon lacks very much and is barely a Belgian White."
"D- Not an overall bad beer. Pretty good for a BMC product I'd say. there are better wits out there, but this is pretty easily found and cheap."
"i gave this beer 5's all across the board because it definitly deserves it. blue moons apperance, smell, and taste is the perfect match for me. its got that perfect dark color, with that strong taste which hints at orange at the end. also i think the best way to drink this beer is from bottle or tap, when drinking from can all the spices at the bottom dont get mixed very well."
"This is the beer I drink at the ball park. It pours with a rich, foamy head that fades away leaving just a trace of foam around the glass. I find that the malt overpowers the hops with a slight spicy nose. The mouth feel is good, full bodied and fruity, with rich flavors, just slightly spicy. It is always served with a wedge of orange, which is ok, but unnecessary. I don't need fruit in my beer, and this beer can stand on its own. It is not like Corona where you need some help to make it palatable."
"This beer is a pretty decent choice in beer wastelands. So many restaurants have this, and for many it's the best choice they have. It's enjoyable enough, and I find bottles sneaking into my mixed sixer pretty often. I couldn't see myself ever picking up a six-pack though, the synthetic orange is a bit too much. If Coors used better quality malts and orange, this could really be something special. But as it is, it's just a pretty good beer. There's no real wheat here though, not something to pick up if you're looking for a witbier."
"Very drinkable, most can enjoy from the beer snob to the mass market sucker."
"D-taste slightly obtained a citrusy bitterness to it, but the orange does stay. with that considered i can still drink large amounts of this with pleasure"
"D - Decently drinkable but ditch the orange when asked. It's already got enough in the beer, the very last think this beer needs is more of it. Not a bad commercial witbier though, I think it just sometimes gets a bad rap from being a Coors product."
"If I had only on complaint it would be that at 170 calories a bottle it can add up on your waistline in a hurry if you worry about such things. In my opinion it is the best beer offering from Coors."
"Smells like moldy orange. I like funk but mold is going in the wrong direction. Tastes like orange Gatorade. Soda-like carbonation. When I went to Ireland a few years ago they had a sports drink that was pretty much carbonated orange Gatorade. This could be one and the same."
"Of course, Hoegarrden is now owned by Inbev-Anhauser Busch, so same goes for them - at least their beer is good to quite good despite their altering the original recipe."
"This was actually far worse than I thought it was going to be. I was expecting a decent rendition of a witbier. I got something that was slightly below average in some ways and dreadful in the most important way."
"As I said up front, not terrible, just not exciting. Makes sense that this is a mass produced version of a Wit."
"D- Good session brew on a hot day"
"D- Easy to drink light beer. Refreshing and perfect after a hard days work."
"D - a very refreshing brew in flavour and feel, although the coriander spice is weighted a little heavy, almost reminds me of a beer and orange juice mix, would make a nice summer session"
"Not as bad as it could or maybe should be, but too thin and sweet to really be worthwhile."
"Drinkability: Really good, nice smell continues into the taste. Great witbier."
"D-Good for a 12 pack"
"One of the best American wheat beers on the market! This beer is drinkable in any season. You can add a small slice of orange to bring out the citrus of the beer, or drink it straight from the bottle. This beer has the right balance of spices and flavors, not overpowering or underwhelming."
"Notes: A touch too spiced, and despite questionable marketing practices it is not too bad a brew in the face of other offerings. However, it is worth every effort to stay away from it when one has a craft choice next to it."
"Even though it may not be ""cool"" to really enjoy this beer among purists since it is brewed by a large brewery, I would recommend this beer for any summer gathering. Oh, also to make the purists cringe, but a orange wedge in this one to really bring out the citrus tones."
"Tangy wheat flavors come out a bit more on the flavor and the orange peel and coriander strike a decent balance. There is a little bitterness from citrus peel and hops, lends a rougher finish than the best witbiers out there. Lacks the softness that others display and is not quite as refreshing either. Still though, I believe this is the best of the ""Moon"" series I have had so far, being the original. A quality offering from my favorite of the macro breweries, Coors."
"D- this is my go to when I am at a bar that doesnt have a huge selection."
"Has a nice light, citrusy flavor to it and is EXTREMELY easy going down. Not overly harsh in the mouth. I didn't garnish with an orange like was suggested, so I'll be sure to try that next time. A nice change of pace from higher ABV beers makes it easy to kick back more than one of these beers. Would have no reservations at all keeping this around the house just for casual drinking. Reasonably priced. Definitely one of the better (the best?) macrobrews I've had."
"I only had one on this occasion but I could have downed several; it's a very drinkable brew at 5.4% abv."
"drinkability - very easy to toss back a couple of blue moons. not a ton of flavor, but decent for a macrobrewed beer. an orange garnish (obviously) heightens the citrus flavor."
"The predominant initial taste is of a vague orange flavor, not as prominent or ""natural"" tasting as I'd like. This leads to a spiciness that has a pretty good intensity...and some wheat showing up at the finish along with some sweetness that I wouldn't necessarily classify as any particular fruit. It's just a bit vague. Finish is pretty clean, little is leftover. What strikes me is how thin this beer seems...it's low on flavor compared to some of the better wits. It's drinkable, sure, but it isn't that wonderful of a representation of style."
"A decent, if mostly uninspiring witbier, which I suppose is the trade-off for mass distribution (with the US, anyways)."
"D- I could easily have a few of these in one sitting. Very refreshing and doesn't fill you up too quick."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and all I had was a pint glass. Being a macro brew, I don't think it affected my rating, let me know if you think differently. The beer a two finger head that left the beer as quickly as it could. The beer was straw yellow that reminds one of a hayfield. The beer slightly smelled of corn without much else definitely not a very definite aroma. The beer had a distinct wheat filled taste to it like a typical witness but it was to weak for my taste. The beer is not overly complex and could be drinkable if you are in the mood for a macro brewed non complex Belgian white."
"I would drink this beer again. I am partial to craft beers so I drank this with hesitation, being from one of the big boys, but not bad. The mouthfeel was very thin, nothing like Sunset Wheat, a fave. A good stand-by beer because of the wide availability."
"M/D: light bodied a little to light in my opinion but the feel actually slightly helps with the drinkability. I would recommend as a good and cheap party beer."
"D-High. Easy to consume. Overall a quality beer with a lot of flavor. Mine was served without an orange, but either way this a good enough beer. I like how well Molsen-Coors has hidden that they make it, trying to separate from it to make is appear %100 craft. I don't care, its a good beer and from my experiences most places carry it as there only craft."
"D-Easy to drink. Overall, when several Macro companies try to make an actually tasty brew they fail. Coors actually succeeds."
"D: a good summer sipper. Skip the orange slice."
"I kind of liked it, but probably will only buy more to undre...uhh...impress a few unfortunate ladies that dare visit the man cave."
"D- Not my favorite of the style but ok. Pretty easy to drink."
"Without a CAN of my own"
"Drinkability: For a beer made by one of the ""big three"" this is actually quite good. Flavorful, but also refreshing and inexpensive enough to just have around as a ""lawnmower"" beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pillowing, fluffy head. I had no orange to garnish my glass with so I did feel a bit let down. Strong scents of orange and also some sugar cookie scents. Taste has an orange like flavor a bit dry on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and solid. This beer is very refreshing in the summer and is a good one to look for at most bars as an alternative to most BMC stuff. Overall the drinkable nature is great."
"Taste is light and wheaty, it's a bit sharp and fresh. For cheap beer it's ok but I wouldn't seek it out. Mouth feel is creamy and sharp and finish is dry. Overall decent macro."
"This is a good universal beer. It appeals to beer drinkers of all kinds, the headie craft beer drinkers, and the common mega swill drinkers. I often use Blue Moon as a bridge to ""enlighten"" people to the availability different beer in the world. Highly drinkable, delicious Belgiany. Good American craft beer."
"D: Solid go to beer when you have to please a variety of palates. Very drinkable and appropriate for any time of year."
"mouthfeel is extremely sharp and sticks to the palate, i disliked the feeling but the taste overpowers it. it has an amazing citrus and bready taste with a strong wheat aftertaste. It is extremel light and easy to drink, just like coors to put this out."
"I some times drink blue moon in my local pub and I got to say its not that bad. It looks great and does have a smooth taste and a good smell. Just get a pitcher cut up some orange slices and you'll enjoy the rich wheat taste it gives after a couple drinks. My final thought its not the best or the worst but its worth a try."
"Figured I'd revisit the past a bit and rock some Blue Moon (sans Platters). It pours a hazy orange straw topped by less than half a finger of white micro-foam (I blame the orange slice). The nose comprises wheat, coriander, and orange peel, all kinda weak, but still definitely wit-y. The taste follows along a similar vein, with notes of coriander, some cardamom, some light hoppy bitters, and a weird harsh orange/other citrus bite that leans toward lime territory. Were it not for that last part, this wouldn't be all that bad. The body is light, with a fizzy carbonation and a feel I can really only describe with the less-than-helpful term ""wet"". Overall, nowhere near a great wit, but they don't all have to be Oscar Wilde...it's still pretty drinkable...and nicely cheap."
"This by far is the best of any brewed by Coors Brewing Company. Looks excellent. Smells really fresh and crisp. Taste and mouthful are really good. No words really to describe its taste. Drinkability is good. Could go through a six pack feeling good. For some reason this beer reminds me of winter and winterfresh gum in taste and appearance"
"pours a cloudy pale orange hue. smells wheatey with a bit of orange. Has a wheatey taste, like the smell that goes smoothly across the palate. it has a medium body and goes down smoothly. Overall, its an alright beer that is pretty common at restaurants and the like, so i'll enjoy one there, but not something i'll buy for myself. there are better witbiers out there. one positive note is that it has been a good starting point for me to get my friends interested in craft beer, since its made by coors, it isn't a big risk for them."
"This was my first witbier and I thought it was alright. Overall, I'd recommend it. Now I'm looking to try its other varieties - the summer ale and honeymoon."
"D - I could drink one after another of this one."
"22 oz bomber. Hazy gold with a short white cap that settled to a collar. Short-lived spotty lace. Lots of orange zest in the aroma, mild coriander, slight yeastiness. Low bitterness with some malt up front. Orange flavour really dominated the finish, nearly juicy, and spices were very light, slightly peppery. Light to medium bodied with lively carbonation, decent texture. It's pretty solid all around and a good choice when you're in an establishment without a craft beer selection."
"D - Very drinkable. I could easily drink several of these in a night."
"Tastes a lot less like a macro than you'd expect. Golden and fairly cloudy. Strong flavor - there were strong citrus and floral flavors but it was less girly than I was lead to believe. Medium bodied and easy to drink although I didn't like the aftertaste."
"This was the first beer that I had that really got me interested in trying different beers. When first poured it pours a hazy orange with a mediocre head that dissipates slowly and has mild lacing. The first thing you notice is the citrus and spices brewed in the beer. Not to hoppy and leaves a clean finish after each sip. This was my beer of choice every Sunday last season when the saints played."
"D- very drinkable. a good session beer, for beer champs and novices alike. I really enjoy this beer on tap. I'll pass up a cerveza and a lot of IPA's to get this one with a meal."
"I regret that I never gave the beer the appreciation that it deserves. It's a delightful beer if you learn to appreciate it. I've enjoyed it with a number of dishes, but i prefer it with a strong tasting grilled chicken. I always use the signature orange peel to garnish."
"Drinkability - Relatively so to be honest. Not a horrible beer - there are just so many others I'd rather drink."
"D: As a once in a while beer, yes. However, there are a few things that you should know about it: never drink it without an orange garnish, never consume it by the keg or even buy a keg of it, and never use it to play beer pong. I realized that mistake after this past New Years."
"not recommended. every bit of flavor that could be appreciated (wheat, coriander, orange(also...orange?)) is swallowed by the adjunct grainy flavor. a poor example of a belgian wit."
"Serving type: bottle"
"loved by the ladies of texas. with more of a kick than the gentleman's beer. a beer that is essentially just two quality of sweet wheat malt and orange peel. nothing to elaborate. not subtle either. not a bad beer. i just can't stand what its done to appreciating beer in the U.S. please no more oranges. it has a decent body though i'll give it that. have an allagash wit you'll never go back."
"cheers!"

"In terms of Belgian Whites, It's 4/5. Very good for an off the shelf case that's usually in stock."
"Drinkability is better than average, but not outstanding. They do serve this in a casino that I frequent, and because of the small selection at the bar, I do wind up drinking quite a bit of this stuff. It's pretty good, even if it's not outstanding."
"D - this is a beer I wouldn'tind having if there was no craft available. It's drinkable, not bad tasting, and offers a gateway for newcomers."
"D. A good American version of a spiced Belgian Witbier. A lack of curacao in the taste leaves me preferring Hoegaarden's witbier."
"All in all it wasn't bad, fairly drinkable because of the sweetness and light consistency, but I won't buy it when other options are available. This beer is pretty much average and is one of the better offerings from Coors."
"D- Not bad when it's on sale, but seriously it is drinkable not to heavy and enjoyable so to all the fellas and ladies skying down the rocky mountains crack open a Blue Moon and howl like a wolf our of breath."
"Pours a cloudy, hazy yellow/orange color, with a nice big rocky white head. Aromas of lemons and oranges and spicy wheat. Nicely carbonated, and very refreshing, with dominant flavors of zesty oranges. Nothing great or special, but a good canned beer for the summer."
"Goes down easy, tastes good but not really my thing. Good for a beginner beer drinker."
"It has a lot of flavor, but almost too much. If wheat were a fruit, this beer would be too fruity. I've never wanted more than one of these at a time. But it is a lovely beer to relax with."
"jd"
"Better than I expected."
"I'm willing to say that in regards to ""Macro"" beer companies (AB, Miller/Coors, etc.), Blue Moon might be the best beer I've ever had from a can."
"D: Not sure if I could drink more than one due to the sweetness. This seems to be a trendy beer at the moment. Let's see where it is in 5 years. At least its a big step up from the Silver Bullet."
"The review ends here. Not good enough to bother with mouthfeel or drinkabliity. It is a good beer if you want to impress your non beer snob friends by drinking an ""exotic"" bbrew."
"Medium to light body, goes down easy. Given the ease of finding Blue Moon, this is often a go-to beer when the other selections are ... grim."
"All in all a very good beer, one of the best I've had."
"Drinkability: this one is quite drinkable the perfect refresher for a hot day easily allowing an individual to have several."
"D- Totally drinkable, best on a warm or hot day."
"I think the taste leaves a lot to be desired--to me, it's a one note song. Still though, it's the standard beer of its kind at most bars. Could do worse."
"D- Damn good,. Tasty and light, I really like drinking this beer"
"Served from tap into a Weizen glass. Poured a yellow-orange that was quite hazy, had a one finger white head, that did not produce any lacing. The aroma was comprised mainly of citrus. Flavor was citrus and sweet that was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is a nice smooth beer that makes a good way for new comers to white ales to get started. Also nice for when you are eating a large meal as it is not very filling. It is not a bad brew, but it's not that good either..."
"D: Would be easy to drink a six pack, but because of the lack of taste, and just as refreshment. Hard to enjoy as a whole."
"drinkability is so so since i dont care for the taste"
"pours a cloudy yellow with a one finger head that quickly fades a light lace. smells of oranges taste of orange and wheat malt can't really get the coriander out of it but taste is pleasant. light to medium mouthfeel good carbonation. taste the same as blue moon in the bottle. nice summer weather beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is low, lacing is decent. The aroma is nice, but a bit weak. It smells like wheat, orange, and some coriander. Taste is just like the aroma, but stronger. It's mostly wheat and orange, along with a bit of coriander. Mouthfeel/body is light, it has decent carbonation and it's quite refreshing. Drinkability is good, it wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. It's not the best witbier I've had, but it's a decent enough brew. And it's a good choice if you're at a bar and can't find anything better, since Blue Moon is found pretty much everywhere for the most part."
"Drinkability: Very simple Witbier that does not have the strong spicy and tart characteristics that I expect. I swear this used to be more flavorful. Has this been toned down or have my tastes changed?"
"Blue Moon is a great beer to have around, there are not many people who will turn one away."
"i suppose this is a belgian, but only because it says so on the label. its not that its a bad beer, its just not a great beer. best in the summer on a hot day, ice cold from a cooler, i'd guess."
"There are far better Belgian Ales out there, it's a shame this is the one that's most popular."
"Drinkability? I drink this on occasion but it isn't one for me to session on. Decent drinkability."
"Overall: Great, easy-to-find beer. A good staple wheat beer. Orange slice doesn't actually add much other than to appearance...it can actually make the beer a bit bitter and flat."
"Overall impression: Good summer beer. Not a fan of Wits and this is a pretty safe example. Still, well crafted and enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Like I said, I kind of want to hate this beer, but it's pretty solid, flavorful and drinkable; I like the flavor and spicy/peppery notes; body isn't too heavy and the ABV isn't too bad at the 5.4% mark... Dammit. A nice summer beer."
"The aroma and flavor were both nice, but it's the mouthfeel where Coors really dumbed it down. After the first sip, I imagined some suit yelling ""lighter!! thinner!"" at some poor brewer until they ended up with this. It's light and crisp, but not in the way you want a wheat based beer to feel. It seems a bit lifeless, with a fizzy, empty feeling carbonation. There is no full, wheat feeling at all and it just feels empty. This is disappointing because to me, the mouthfeel of a witbier is worth more to me than the 10% BA weighs."
"D: Would definitely drink again, it would fair well against other American macro-brewed beers."
"D - Drink it all day. Not a high ABV and not challenging to the palate."
"One of my personal favorite ""main stream"" beers. Has a nice golden color to it, with a pretty small white head, which remains for the majority of the time it took to drink it. Pretty citrusy flavor, which is best complimented by a slice of citrus fruit squeezed into the beer itself, although the beer is great without the fruit. Very drinkable, if you are looking for something that is easy to drink, Blue Moon is the way to go."
"On draft at a local la-de-da country club. They served it with an orange slice in it, which I promptly took out and deposited in the nearest available cocktail napkin. Orange color, smelled kinda sweet, pretty good head. Forgot what it smelled like, so not much. Taste was pleasant, not as spicy as some of the better wits I've had. Could drink a few of these, though"
"As many wheat bears refreshing in warm weather. This one keeps rather low profile and should fit beginners."
"Pours a orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty/wheat, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, yeasty, with some spice notes. Medium body. Slightly drinkable, would not buy again."
"However, this is a great summer back yard party beer. Its easy light and refreshing and good for hot summer BBQ's. If you can forget its trying to pass itself off as a serious wit, its and easy drinker while hanging with the friends by the pool eating a burger. But if your looking for a quality wit, this isnt the beer."
"Blue Moon pours a golden color with a good sized head. There is a citrus like order to it thats is pretty unquie to blue moon. The taste is the same, it has a cirtuis like taste, and overall is unquie, and light. Even though its lighter I find it hard to drink a few of these, the taste becomes unpleasent after a while. Overall not a bad beer, and is very easy to find too."
"They didn't even give me an orange with the damn thing...that would've been the best part."
"Very easy to drink, this beer was pretty flavorful and refreshing."
"Drinkability- I could drink a few of these although it's not my first choice. It's a little too sweet and could get boring after awhile."
"As I said, the keg was a little dead, but that's no fault of the beer's. Perhaps a bit off on this night, but as a rule, very consistent and good."
"D- Drinkable, and smooth. Good drinkability."
"Blue Moon used to be a go to beer for me when I was at a bar that was unfriendly to craft beer. However, recently the orange character of the beer has become artificial tasting and much too prominent. Also, the sweetness really makes it tough for me to have more than one or two. I don't know for a fact that the recipe has changed, but it wouldn't surprise me since it comes from a corporate brewer, and they're always looking for cost cutting moves."
"D - Blue Moon is ok in the ""middle of the road"" sense. On the whole, I think it is lacking clarity. It could be a lot better or a lot worse."
"D-its kind of funky and seems to have some weird funky yeast flavor. It is smooth and creamy with a fair amount of citrus sweetness."
"Cheers!"
"D: Since my first one, (ahh to reminisce. a beer is never quite the same after that first one, the realization and amazement of each brew tried the first time, loses some appeal) I've had probably millions of pints of this, on tap, etc. It can be sessioned, but not as easily drinkable as Hoegaarden is (I can drink that stuff like water) But at a dive bar that has MBC, or this, I'd choose this. The only exception occurred during New Years, when I chose Guinness over this."
"Mouthfeel holds steady. This really is a flavorful beer throughout, despite what any macro fearing people may prejudge as. Its not the best in this style you'll ever come across, but its aftertaste is good and sticks. Drinkability suffers as this beer is way overpriced, probably to pay for Coors Light's NFL ex coaches in their commerials."
"Notes: Used to be my favorite beer before I got into craft beer. The flavors seem a little light now, average for the style but pretty good for being an inbetweener of macro and craft."
"The mouthfeel was below average, very little if any joy. The beer was very drinkable in the sense that it slid down the throat without any effort, but it was undrinkable in the sense that there was no enjoyment to be had with this beer. Avoid."
"D/O - A pretty average, entry level Belgian Witbier. If this was the only beer available, I could definitely polish off a sixer of this. Bottom-line: It's not gonna to make you jizz in your pants, but it's not that bad. Cheers."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Nothing really disappointed me here. All in all a really solid brew that I would recommend to pretty much anyone who likes beer."
"Pours a hazy light orange, head quickly dissipates into absolute nothingness. I like the color though. Smells like orange soda. Looks like orange soda too, actually. I think this is my first time having it without the orange peel, and I can definitely say it doesn't need it. There is significant orange taste already, light, refreshing. I suppose it's faults lie in being very one-dimensional and thin, but that is the point I guess. Barely a wheat taste here, tastes more like a fruit beer than a witbier. Very drinkable but the taste I think would be a bother after a while. Definitely not bad, I'm sure this has swayed many people into liking beer. Kudos to Coors for actually making a beer worth trying."
"Got this on tap at Dicky's Wild Hare in Fort Wayne. Served with a hazy orange color. Smelled very nice, and sweet. Tasted fruity, but with a bit of the ale aftertaste. This is a good beer on tap to go to in the clutch. Easily could drink a few of these and not get tired of the taste. Really enjoyed this paired with some Shaggy Snacks."
"Drinkabity...would be easy to drink a few but if you like to challenged by you beer at all..this one isn't it."
"Overall, a good intro into craft beer and especially the style..."
"this is a good beer by all means and is readily available all over, worth a try."
"Overall a great beer at a great price that is very close to a true Belgian wit."
"It always does me in pinch when Bud Light is th eonly other choice....but the muddy bottom always throws me."
"D: This beer is probably responsible for the ""serve an orange with your wheat beer"" trend here in the US. The beer is decent enough, but an overly powerful orange flavor and aroma is just a bit much for me."
"Serving type: tap - pint"
"Drinkability: potential for session beer."
"I may be a bit biased with this report due to the fact that I am not usually a huge fan of Witbier (IPA all the way). However I was pleasantly surprised that a company such as Coors could produce such a crisp, refreshing, and even (dare I say it), high quality beer at such a huge production rate. The coriander and orange are both evident in the nose and on the palate. An easy introduction into the world of craft beers for those use to drinking cheap swill from the ""Big Guys""."
"Notes: Things start of pretty promising for this beer. It looks pretty good and the smell is actually not bad. Although these two highlights are not close to a world class beer at all, things only go down hill. The taste is much more macro lager like than I expected from the look and smell. The mouthfeel is also kind of unrefined. It's almost like they tinkered with it to try and make is seem heavier and more lager like, than super light and airy like some good wits."
"Overall- Blue Moon is far inferior to other beers of the style. It is a keeper if you are dragged to a place that only sells BMC, or it is on sale in 6 or 12 pack glass. I feel this is the best continuously made product made by Coors. If you end up somewhere that only serves BMC, there is a good chance they have Blue Moon as a drinkable standby."
"Average, but for a macro/micro I have to give them more credit than I honestly wanted to. /me concedes"
"Highly drinkable, in spite of its lacking parts. No wonder people drink this, it makes up for its lackluster flavor and aroma with a guzzleable quality."
"mouthfeel / drinkability - I thought and still think that this is the best part of this beer. There is a pleasant heft without losing the ability to quench a thirst. I am generally not a fan of watery beers, but a guinness isn't always the best solution when the throat is dry."
"Excellent wheat style beer. Very hazy look with orange tint. Smells very good and tastes very good. Probably not my favorite wheat beer but still very high on the list, and price is very reasonable compared to others. Easiest wheat beer to find for sure, many others are not available at most every store you go to."
"D: this is relatively easy drinking but it does not have the most pleasant flavor profile. All of the typical Belgian white ale flavors are there, but they are not very well balanced."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden with a medium white head. Smells strongly of raw wheat and spices. Taste is pleasant enough; quite bread-like malt character, with a big citrus and spicy finish. Very little bitterness; to style. Finishes dry and watery. Mouthfeel is also watery, good carbonation though. Good drinkability, inoffensive and appeals to the masses. A decent beer, but there are better Witbiers out there."
"This beer is decent, good head, and lacing. Great with oranges, orange peel, orange zest. This is also very good with coriander. This beer is a good white beer, made in a Belgian style, a mock-off of Hoegarden. But still a very popular beer, good taste, and good to have around on parties, tail-gating and on tap."
"You can get this brew most anywhere in NYC, but I happened to have it at Mulhollands in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It's a beer that you can't go wrong with and is a good deal better than Bud Light Wheat if you are looking for a wheat from a mass producer. Coors did a good job with this one. It's not amazing, but it's certainly a respectable effort."
"not overly complex, easy drinking, very easy drinking...witbier for the masses"
"I won't say this is amazing because it isn't. Blue Moon is too sweet and isn't very complex. As far as a Coors product goes? This is the holy grail (besides the other seasonal brews which are sometimes holier)."
"Finally tried it without the customary orange slice and was a little disappointed in how slight the flavor is. It has a nice, cloudy appearance with a pleasant wheat aroma. Subtle slightly citrusy flavor. Lots of carbonation, maybe almost too much for me. But a very drinkable beer (I think more so in summer) and a good go-to choice at places where your choices may be limited."
"(bottle into tumbler) Pours a hazy dark amber with a nice sized white head that lasted fairly well. It's a bit surprising that this is macrobrewed! Aroma had a hint of honey, but was primarily citrus, chiefly orange. Thankfully I was spared what most find the obligatory orange slice on the glass when this is served at a bar. Mouthfeel was very creamy with pleasant carbonation. The taste of the orange was rather forward, but not overpowering, and there was a nice crisp finish. This has always been one of my standbys!"
"Blue Moon is exceptional on-tap (with an orange slice, of course). It's very flavorful, but not too sweet. This beer goes down very smooth and leaves you wanting more. Blue Moon is alright from a bottle, but just isn't the same as on-tap. Definitely one of my favorite brews."
"everything about this beer screamed macro production. the body was an odd slickness and it was hardly carbonated. the body looked like a third of the contents were ornage juice, and frankly the taste suggests that too. nothing worthy to note about the nose, but it does make an easy going drinking beer, as long as it is cold enough."
"Drinkability - a low abv and a decent taste make it something I would be happy to have at stranger's summer barbeque!"
"D: Very easy to drink, except for the aforementioned."
"D. I guess this would be an OK beer to have when you are just chillin at some club, but it was a little thin and the flavor just didn't come through for me."
"Overall Impressions: Not a ton of flavor (at least without the added orange slice). Smooth and refreshing, making for a decent beer for warm weather drinking."
"D: Very high drinkability, but it's not really a beer to savor. Just something to throw back if you're in the mood for a moderately-priced wheatbeer. Its high availability is definitely a plus."
"To me, this beer is the zenith in some sort of quest for mediocrity. Enough taste and character that you can find it if you are looking for it, but still reeking of the corner-cutting indicative of mass production. Though drinkable, it is not a beer I wiil ever reach for when given a choice."
"D: Good beer."
"Has a light wheat color with a light orange-yellow hue when poured. Head was thin and white. Aroma was filled with spice and citrus, which was also in the taste. Taste overall was a bit watery, but good overall. There are better witbiers out there, but you can't go wrong with this, probably a good starter beer as well."
"very popular wheat beer available everywhere, standard setup with and orange, I have heard it referred to as a great 'beginner beer'. Very easy to drink but I can only drink a couple in a sitting. I guess it's a little too sweet to drink a lot of."
"D: I had trouble finishing the glass before it was half gone. Again, too carbonated as it comes out of the bottle. Would be very difficult to drink with out bleeding off some of the carbonation pouring it into the glass. I liked it much better after repeatedly shaking the carbonation out of the glass,"
"I wanted to keep an open mind, but now I'm on the bandwagon: this beer is a conspiracy."
"I really enjoyed this stuff."
"Taste: Lemony but with more of the maltier sweetness of the grains. The taste is subtle but very good, not at all like other whites, it lacks the spiciness (good or bad)."
"Drinkability: Where this lacks in complexities, it gains in drinkability as it does not overwhelm the palate and has a good abv for long sessions. An orange would benefit this beer greatly as it would add more complexity and I am sure its brewed to be accompanied by one."
"All in all quite a nice surprise from a very light beer. Pleasant/ proof positive that a lighter style beer can have nice flavors and some sophistication, even if brewed on a gigantic level. Nice surprise here."
"D - mildly drinkable. gets a bad rap but actually not bad at all. probably one of the first ""craft"" beers i ever had...remember thinking it tasted like sweet belgian waffles or froot loops."
"Decent beer, nothing special. Great for parties or an ok standby at a not so great bar."
"Drinkability: A solid beer and a good showing by a macro corporation. Nothing life-changing but a solid, cheap beer."
"Draft: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a small foamy had with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sugary wheat malt with light bubblegum notes. Taste is bit too sweet for the style with some bubblegum notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad too not spiced enough with too much residual sugar."
"Pours a cloudy golden oranage color with a full frothy white head, but with little retention, ok lacing. Scent is a huge candied orange whiff with hints of corriander and white pepper. Taste follows scent with an almost cloyingly sweet candied orange flavor. Spices (corriander, white pepper) are there but do littl eto mask the sweetness. Needs any presence of grains or hops to balance it out. Lighter side of medium bodied, active carbonation, big aftertaste that lingers long. Overall, it tastes slightly too sweet and candied and needs grains to balance is out (see Alagash for help)"
"Medium to light bodied beer with a nice amount of carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I know I point out above that it is a little mild for my taste; while that is true, it is still an extremely sessionable beer. It's among my favorites for band practice or watching football."
"Poured into a glass tumbler it forms a 5 mm white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. The Aroma is faintly of citrus and wheat. The color is golden orange and cloudy. The taste is of spice and citrus with some wheat coming through after a bit. Mouth-feel is good with moderate to strong carbonation. It's a fine brew, and I could knock one after another of these back in an evening. Much to be preferred over the rest of the stuff you find on tap in some places."
"D: This is a excellent Belgian Style Witbier that I can drink over and over again. I never have a piece of citrus fruit in my witbier, by choice of course."
"D: A good witbier and the price point is hard to beat. Definitely a crowd pleaser if you are having people over. Even more so in the summer sitting poolside. I have had better wits but Coors still does a decent job with this one."
"Not a bad beer at all, a little tangy with high drinkability. Won't turn this down if it's at a party or a bar downtown."
"Overall, this beer isn't all that bad. I like the spices up front but not how they die of so quick. I can see myself drinking this in the right place and time. Not something I would obviously seek out though. It is somewhat drinkable, but way too over-carbonated for me"
"The head disappeared pretty quickly. The Smell was pretty good, Wheat, citrus fruits and coriander. The taste and the mouth feel were, IMHO, a bit of a letdown in comparison to other witbiers. It felt as if they were watered down, the taste was very faint. This was a decent beer but, I'd rather have another witbier with more flavor."
"Poured into a weizen glass (with no orange slice), a hazy amber, with less than a finger of white head that collapsed quickly, and didn't lace very well. The smell did reveal the expected lemon zest and clove, but it was mild and overpowered by yeastiness and wheat. The flavor confirmed this; mostly wheat'ish flavor with very, very subtle lemon, orange peel, and spice. The feel was light with decent carbonation...certainly light enough to session. However, I'd rather grab a Hoegaarden for more flavor."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well this beer was decent I guess, it's extremely drinkable but it lacked in appearance & flavor. I though the flavor needed more zests & spice, and allot more citrus, it was just a little water as well, but not bad. I could drink 3-4, or as many as I wanted really, not a seeker though, I would pass."
"D - great session beer. great lawn-mower beer. great summer beer. Only danger I run is a headache if I've had too many."
"D: Goes down smoothly."
"d- good, pretty drinkable, witbiers aren't my favorite but this is drinkable, and it could be much worse being brewed by coors, overall pretty decent."
"Brewed by Blue Moon Brewing Co, huh? Anyways pours hazy pale orange with creamy white head. Poor retention and little lacing. Smell is fruity with some grains but kinda smells like Fruity Pebbles. Taste is about the same. No offensive by any means, just a fruity taste that seems very unnatural. Mouthfeel was fine, not too thin, smooth going down. Overall better than I expected but wouldnt purchase on my own."
"Mouthfeel is is light bodied with a good bite of carbonation."
"D- This beer is drinkable because of the watered down factor. I would drink this instead of the typical BMC offerings if I had to drink. This is a average beer to say the least but you can put them back if you really wanted to. This also is a good beer to have someone try if they want something other than the pilsners of BMC."
"Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass. Big orange hue with ample cloudiness evident. Not much activity on frothing and no lacing or very faint lacing happening. Smelt outrightly of wheat and citrus - very close to a Hoe. The taste was very funny though - lots of wheat and coriander finishing off with a distinctive bitter note, unlike a wit. Mouthfeel was medium and averagely carbonated. I would not outrightly recommend this one, there are definitely more drinkable wits out there."
"Drinkability: I mean, it's not hard to drink a lot of this. It's light, and on a hot day with some food, it's easy to go down. Even though it was another scorcher last night, can't say this really hit the spot, either. It's a macro beer in a nice dress, with a bit more character than Coors, however. I really do find this to be transition beer, as those who order and buy it tend to think they want something more than BMC, but don't really know where to go from there. For that, I've respected Blue Moon and salute it for what it is, it's just really not something I'd ever pick to buy as a mainstay to the fridge."
"D - While the style itself tends to be pretty drinkable due to how light it is, this beer does not fare too well in comparison to others in the style. The roughness of the wheat actually hinders the drinkability a bit."
"This is far from the best beer out there, but it's good. I wonder how different people's ratings would be if this wasn't a Coors product suffering from anti-big-brewery bias. It's better than (though not as subtle as) Hoegaarden, which is probably the most popular beer of this type."
"Drinkability: Do not try this, one of the worst things I have tasted for a long time, if not, ever. It doesn't taste like beer. Couldn't actually finish it!"
"MF/D: Better offering from Coors for sure. Light in body, long fruity (orange) finish. A little rough around the edges"
"Drinkability - I like this beer from time to time, but one is about all I can take. Could probably go well for a nice summer day barbecue or something."
"O: My initial review of this beer was negative. In hindsight it was probably a bad batch or something... Its not an awful example of the style"
"Hell; I don't even like the label on the bottle. I am so NOT impressed by this beer that I am shocked that so many people rated this beer at least a B."
"M & D - medium bodied and smooth. These are very drinkable and go down real easy, sometimes like your not even drinking beer...is that good?"
"I'll have another..."
"Overall, a pretty tasty, very easy to drink beer, that seems to take a bashing just because it's brewed in Golden, Colorado."
"This beer poured an interesting dark yellow, and had a distinct sweet citric aroma. This beer has a mild citric taste which is nice, the problem is many bars will place an orange wedge on the glass which completely throws off the balance of the beer. Therefore, be warned, and ask for the beer straight out of the tap. On this occasion however, I bought a 22oz bottle which my wife and I shared which we both enjoyed. When I was in college I really liked this beer because it was flavorful without being overpowering and I could have several without feeling too full."
"Overall, a solid Witbier, ironically brought to us by Coors. I prefer Hoegaarden and other micro Wit's I've had, but this is a great go-to beer all around (and a cheaper alternative to the aforementioned beer)"
"Golden Color, mildly fruity flavor, though I didn't really detect as much of one as I had initially anticipated. Decent carbonation, no complaints there. Nothing really distinguishes it from other wheat beers however. I certainly enjoyed drinking it, but it didn't really rock my world."
"Seems quite watery. Very little carbonation."
"A very good brew that even your average Joe can appreciate. Enjoy it with a slice of Orange or without, it's a great summer beer and is one of my favorite ""go to"" beers. I was extremely depressed to hear that it is a product being sold by Coors but, despite this, I will continue to enjoy it. Hey, maybe it'll put the ""silver bullet"" out to pasture forever."
"Decent for a macro witbier. Again, not the best by any means, but I'll settle for one at a restaurant or bar when nothing else looks good on the tap/bottle list."
"Drinkability: The perfect summer beer, and it would work pretty well any other time as well. A good drink."
"I had this beer after pouring into a curved wheat beer type glass. As far as appearance goes, it poured nicely with about a half finger head. The color was a nice golden orange. I could definitely tell it was unfiltered and the carbonation was good. It smelled of oranges but I couldn't pick up any other smell, maybe some malt if I sniffed really hard. The taste was pretty good as far as a macro goes. Initial taste is full of orange and it exits with a malty taste in the mid palette and a rough almost alcohol taste in the back. This is a very drinkable beer especially on a hot afternoon. Very sessionable. Overall, this is a good, cheap, macro beer."
"M/D - Light body with a little carbonation, would have like to tasted more. Very smooth and easy to drink and super refreshing."
"Poured cloudy, deep golden in color with a slightly spicy/lemony aroma. Taste is rather simple with moderate body, soft and creamy with a slightly wheat twang. goes down smooth and leaves a refreshing aftertaste that lingers. It was an easy got to beer for lunch today since I was out and my liver is demolished from a massive session of barleywine."
"The beer is hazy orange color with a 1 finger head. The aroma is slight citrus, more orange than lemon, and some spices are noticeable as well, maybe a light dose of coriander. The taste is surprisingly nice, good yeasty esters and more of the spice, not as rich as Hoegaarden but then again not bad at all for a gateway wit. The body is heavy enough, the flavors are sweet overall, maybe not overly complex but you can tell it's a wit. Not bad at all, always easy to choose in a pinch."
"(Review off of tasting notes dated July 19, 2009)"
"Overall, a pretty good witbier. Sure, there are better (St. Bernardus) but if you're on a budget this is a great brew to keep in the fridge. After mowing the lawn on a hot day I can't think of a beer I'd rather have."
"D: Overall, a pretty decent brew and would be drinkable by nearly anyone."
"This is a very drinkable brew - but not a top tier Witbier. A nice American brewed wheat beer, especially by a macro brewery. I like it, it is a nice crowd pleaser; but it is a bit lacking in flavor."
"Had it at the Hive on campus. Thin half finger head in the pint glass. Hazy yellow beer with white hue. Some lacing. Throwing in a slice of orange gives it a bit more taste. Its got a slight orange peel and coriander taste to it. Its not sweet or bitter its not much of anything. Its not a horrible tasting beer, There just isn't a hole lot to it. Disappointing for the hype I got from friends."
"Pours and orange hazy color with a decent head and some lacing. The aroma is of orange but is faint compared to others in this class. The taste isn't bad, its kinda weak, taste is of orange and some wheat. The taste is slightly watery. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy with a little watery feel to it. You could drink this beer a lot. Not as complex in smell and taste as most witbiers are. The orange taste is weak but overall a decent beer."
"Overall-not bad at all, not my favorite version of the style but sometimes in a macro bar this is the best beer you come across. Decent job, I'll give credit where it is due."
"You really can taste the orange especially with one in the beer, but there is still a nice spice component."
"Overall not bad, the strong orange taste could be the reason why, 30 something women love this beer."
"I was expecting Coors Light with lemon. It's much more than that, but it's not a great beer either."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Although I have my problems with it, I prefer it to most macros and it is a crowd pleaser among non-beer fans."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle marked OCT0509-E50861. Sampled on July 5, 2009. The pour is a kind of hazy orange with almost no head on top and really no lacing to speak of. The aroma is a weak mixture of wheat and yeast but it is vey toned down compared to an original Belgian Abbey Ale. The mouthfeel is of medium texture and the taste is a tad spicy and tart. I think it is an fair effort by Miller but it does not quite hit the mark for me."
"peace"
"Belgian White pours cloudy with little head. Color is light brown to yellow. Smells of citrus. Has a light hoppy malty taste with a hint of lemon. Not very heavy but excellent drinkability. This beer would go great with a fish dinner. Had this beer in a 22 oz frosted draft glass at Applebees."
"Poured to a offwhite head that didnt hang around very long. Ale was a cloudy yellow. No lacing was evident on the glass. I thought there would be at least a little, but no. Smelled of lemon and yeast. Tasted of citrus, yeast, and coriander. Had a slight lemon bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. Just thought maybe a little on the watery side. I didnt know that Blue Moon was brewed by Coors. I guess you learn something new everyday. I dont think I would like to make this a session beer. But once in a Blue Moon it would be ok."
"On a side note, a half bottle refrigerated retained its flavor without deteriorating sourly."
"Overall this is a decent macro pretending to be a micro. It's not going to win any contests but the kids sure do love it."
"Drinkability- pretty good, have had a few of them before, my gf loves them"
"D- this wasnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be. its certainly not the best example of the style, or my favorite, but its a great beer compared to other macros and carried by alot of chain restaurants."
"Not the best Witbier you are going to find, but it's pretty impressive for a Coors product."
"That being said, I think Blue Moon is one of the better beers widely available in the United States. A smooth beer that looks good and tastes great. Nice creamy head, orange tint, citrus flavor - an excellent way to start appreciating beers. But keep in mind: it's only a start."
"Lacks some depth. I actually think that 'Shocktop' by...gulp....anheuser busch, is actually a better witbier."
"This is a beer to drink and enjoy. I wouldn't want to down a bunch of these to get drunk."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, and refreshing to boot."
"This beer pours a light hazy orange/yellow with a one finger white head that fades fairly quickly, not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of lemon citrus, wheat, and corriander. Taste is of coriander, lemon and orange citrus, wheat, and a touch of pepper in the finish. This is a lighter bodied beer that feels rather thin, medium carbonation, crisp finish. Reasonable drinkability, though there are better of the style."
"Drinkability: A decent brew. As a newbie I thought so highly of Blue Moon, but the cloying lemon/coriander flavor is overwhelming. Not terrible, though."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink and a decent American version of a Belgian Witbier, but if given the choice I'd go for a couple of other Witbiers first, if possible."
"Very drinkable. Could easily have a bunch of these. People are very surprsied to find out this is made by Coors."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a brownish orange color with about an inch of head. There is some lacing to the glass. The smell is both sweet and spicy. The taste is most excellent. There is a slight sweetness to it with no bitterness. This is one of the more delicious American beers I have had. I will be buying Blue Moon again soon."
"Drinkabiltiy - this easily is a session beer. Not too heavy but not too light, either. Perfect for relaxing on a warm summer night."
"Very drinkable and a first choice when I go to a bar looking for a good american pitcher."
"D: very easy to drink. a good overall beer, worth a try, nothing special."
"D: Ya for sure but a little overpriced and i would rather buy local."
"This beer is easy to get along with. Its lack of distinguishing characteristics make it almost impossible to hate... or to love. Blue Moon is basically exactly what you'd expect of a BMC attempt at a craft beer.: relatively bland for the style and altogether unremarkable. It definitely tastes better than Coors Light, though."
"It was about 85 degrees today after work, and I went out with some co-workers. We went to an average bar, and since it was so hot out, I didn't want anything too heavy. This beer usually does the trick. Served in a pint glass, with a lemon that I squirted and then removed. Cloudy orange color. White head that disappeared shortly after the first sip. Has a slight smell of coriander, but very faint. Bit of a citrusy flavor to it, but very subdued. This is not a witbier that is strong on flavor. But I think that's the point. It's made for the average bar patron, or in my case, the beer that I want when I am having a beer just to have one. The one thing that it has going for it is that it's pretty easy to drink. Sip one on a hot evening, or gulp one down at then end of the night when you don't want anything too hearty. Every beer has its place, and occasionally a Blue Moon comes in handy."
"Had on tap into a pint glass. I managed to keep the fruit out of it this time. Pours an hazy orange color with a half inch white head. The head vanishes rather quickly, leaving no lacing. This is a little disappointing -I thought I remembered the beer being prettier. Smells of some citrus, and some coriander. There's maybe a bit of a grassy/grainy smell in there as well. You can taste the citrus upfront and a bit of coriander and spice. I've had easier drinking wits I think. The spices in this one could be a bit brighter. Still, it's a decent beer and is available almost everywhere."
"Drinkability- Very very drinkable beer, so refreshing and an amazing beer considering its made by coors its by far the greatest thing they have done for sure, it succeeds in being simple yet amazingly refreshing, could see this as an amazing beer on a hot summer nite with a nice smokey barbque, a good find for good price,"
"Drinkability: This is drinkable enough but not very complex. In fact it tastes more like lightly sweetened orange soda than beer. I could probably drink more than one but probably woudn't if there was a choice."
"This is a great beer to drink on a warm summer day, though I'm not sure I'd want to have more than a few in one drinking session."
"Drinkability - The smooth taste and light ABV make this a easy session beer."
"I have had it served in a glass before at a pool hall which came with an orange slice I believe, this only added to the amazing taste. I would recommend this beer to anyone that can afford it."
"D - A crisp, refreshing, drinkable beer. This will be a good summertime beverage that many will enjoy. Nice job by Coors"
"The appearance is a cloudy golden-brown. There's about a one-finger head with very light lacing. The smell is mild and pleasant, unquestionably orange with notes of spice. The taste is, citrus, wheat and spices. A sweet orange taste dominates without overpowering. The light spiciness comes through in the finish as well. It is light-bodied and smooth with some nice carbonation. The finish is dry with a little citrus and spice acidity."
"D: One after the other, it tastes great. It's smoothe and has some character to it. With the added orange it makes it even better. It's what a witbier should be."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer that well represents this style despite being from Coors!"
"Final Thoughts: If there are no other options available, Blue Moon will do."
"d: excellent, i drink this beer all the time out of a bottle, even better in a glass, and excellent with a slice of orange. i highly recomend this beer to anyone who prefers light refreshing beer!!!"
"The color is very vibrant with a translucent and hazy orange color with a thin amount of head and few lacing. The aroma is not that great, but the scents are very wheat and citrus oriented with some spiciness. The taste is pretty on-par with an orangy flavor more palpable than others. The beer coats the mouth fairly well with its carbonation. Very little bitter aftertaste - the citrus appears more, especially with the orange slice in the glass. I'd say it's very drinkable beer to just chill out with, but I'd look for other options if possible."
"T: Eh. It can't hold a candle to, say, Allagash White, but it's the crown jewel of the Coors portfolio, for what that's worth. I'd never seek this out, but it's a good enough beer of last resort if I'm at a bar with a lousy selection."
"Interesting though that without the yeast it tastes like A bad coors O."
"D: As with most versions of the witbier style, it's refreshing and exceedingly easy to drink. This isn't a great one (won't replace a true Belgian, for example) , but it's a good introduction. Just don't feel obligated to serve with an orange wedge - it's fine as is."
"Appearance is an attractive orange-gold with a weak white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of spices, hops and the slightest hint of grains. The taste is off balance, tipping to the spices and even strong alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is not to my liking, seems over carbonated. Drinkability is low because of the imbalance and the carbonation level."
"Overall, an excellent wit that I highly recommend. I think it gets a lot of backlash since people know it's from Coors and they want to bash it because of it. It this was from another name big name craft brewery, I guarantee it would be higher scores. Herd mentality definitely at play on this one. I'd still rather have White Rascal, Mothership Wit, Hoegaarden but this one earns a place in the rotation."
"This is coming up on a drainpour for me, which is surprising. Maybe I only drink these after I've had a few or maybe this bottle is bad, but it's not clicking at all."
"Cloudy golden straw color with a white foamy head. Some rising prickle. Innocuous nose. Fruit forward flavor that starts with a strong attack of banana. The fruit flavors fade towards the finish and the the beer finishes smooth. By the time the beer clears the mouth you could have been drinking any traditional/straightforward style or flavor of beer. I feel pretty confident that this used to be an independent brewer and surely Coors has tamed it and made it more predictably consistent. I didn't have many options as I had it in a restaurant that was definitely more about the food and family atmosphere than the beer, but I wanted a beer and this was good enough to satisfy me."
"-RR"
"drinkability-wise... if you looking for a spiced Belgian ale this is nice and affordable. its just not a personal favorite honestly..."
"drinkability is definitely one you could drink for a day, some like it with an orange, others don't but not a bad beer"
"Note: This review was done without the benefit(?) of the brewery suggested orange slice garnish."
"Conclusion: This is decent, a bit simple/one dimensional...good beer to get BMC drinkers into craft beer, however...this is alright, but I like a bit more tartness/funk/spice to my wits"
"After Thoughts: This is not a bad attempt at this style, and is a very good product seeing it came from Coors."
"Overall- pretty refreshing. Not as good as some higher-end witbiers but it certainly holds it own."
"Blue Moon Belgian White is our ""fancy"" beer for when my friends and I want to sit around and drink rather than sit around and get drunk. I drank it out of the bottle this time but it pours a hazy orangey color. Its smells of oranges or something else citrus. As soon as it is in your mouth orange hits your palate and all is good in the world. Blue Moon Belgian White is a delicious beer and I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"had this beer with a few years of variety and a taste for good beer, I will say, Blue Moon is very good. It has a cloudy appearance, as unfiltered wheat beers have, and which I find very appealing. There are subtle hints of citrus in its smell, very enticing. The taste is quite refreshing, with a small burst of orange at the end. Its 5.4% alcohol content gives it a little heavier feel which goes excellent with its subtle orange flavor. It really drinks nice, too. I found myself going through them really fast. This is definitely a good beer. Not the best, but a solid one that one should try."
"D) Blue Moon is an excellent, craft style American Witbier. Especially good when you are having more than one"
"D 3.5 - this is okay brew, average of the style at best. It was one of my first transition craft brews, and it's easily accesible so I give it a 3.5. It is a bit to sweet for my current palate."
"While it's not spectacular, this is a moderately refreshing, sessionable choice that rivals Hoegaarden if I want a low-priced wit."
"This is a solid example of the style. If there were nothing else good available, I would have one of these."
"Last evening we went out to watch a few of the NCAA games and I thought, heck I have never reviewed this brew - so what the heck. Brew had a nice cloudy orange color with a thick white head that broke down pretty quickly but did have a white film throughout though it lead to just a few spots of lacing. The aroma is pretty nice, citrus fruit of orange and lemon come to mind with some very light spicing. The flavor is also very good, nice mix of spicy, coriander and malts. Nice sweet feel, goes down very easy. People who really like wit beers would probably say that this one is a little light in some of its properties but it is made for the masses and is a good representation and seems very popular. We usually do not go to restaurants that have a poor beer selection but if so and they have this one I would get this in an instant."
"Overall: I had blue moon belgian white on it's own and with dinner - steak sandwich with onion and mushrooms, and it was a great experience either way. The sweetness was appreciated as was the refreshing taste following a day after walking around in the sun, I recommend."
"This is a tasty and refreshing, very drinkable interpretation of the style. I could have a 6 pack of these in the summer if that weren't considered alcoholism."
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a cloudy, honey-gold color with lots and lots of rising carbonation. The three finger head was off-white and retained quite nicely as a cap that left pretty good lacing. The aroma was pleasant and clean, orange, coriander, pale malt sweetness. The flavors were not quite as well developed but still solid. I tasted pale malt and a little adjunct (corn?) grain up front with the orange and orange peel and light spices in the middle. The finish was a little macro-ish and perhaps slightly metallic but not bad. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation the same. This is actually a solid, widely available, inexpensive example of a Belgian White and therefore it is also the best product the Coors Brewing Co makes, period. Try it, gulp it, order another."
"Not bad, but seems fairly boring for a Wit. I was honestly expecting a bit more from this beer; more fermentation complexity would definitely be appreciated."
"not a bad beer.. nice and refreshing .. it kinda has a bazzoka bubble gum taste to it..appearance is cloudy.. avaerage head and a yellowish haze to it.. smell with oranges like a fruity drink.. taste its sweet .. can taste a wheat base.. and fruity notes.."
"A totally mediocre bev. That said, one of the first ""Belgian"" style beers I ever had, so it was somewhat of a revelation at the time. I think it's great that this stuff exists, at least so that dumb high school kids can discover there's something other than Beast in this world."
"D- Not refreshing really, all thin and void of complexity with an overwhelming orange syrupy sweet note, making this a pass!"
"D-This wasn't for me, sorry."
"As many know this has become quite commercialized and is nearly everywhere, but I've found it's maintained to be a solid beer. Pours a cloudy medium orange with very slight carbonation. Overall taste has heavy presence of orange no matter if you put the generic orange nearly always served at your local chain restaurant. These things said, I can't rate this beer badly and it occasionally will beat out the standard Sam Adams. Last thing, although solid it's not a beer I can drink too many of so my drinkability rating suffers."
"Drinkability- As with most wheat beers, it is somewhat filling, but isn't unbearable"
"Anyway this is as good as Coors gets. It is a nice beer that has just enough taste and smell to make you want to drink it. I will say it is a bit yeasty."
"-Overall just not all that drinkable. What can else can I say? One day I figure out the problem."
"That's right you heard me"
"Hmmm, you know, I've tried several Belgian Whites, and I think this is going to be one of my favorites, especially considering the price. Not my favorite style, but for what it is, I really quite like it. It's got a citrus smell, and a citrus, orangey taste. It's a bit sweet, but not so bad that it leaves you thirsty. Several people say they can smell and/or taste hops, but I don't. The citrus and orange covers it up for me if it's there. All in all, a nice white, and very drinkable."
"I rated the drinkability as ""Average"" because (to me), this beer has an interesting habit of leaving my palette feeling ""slightly thirsty."" I suspect this is somehow due to the acidity of the orange and the finish produced by the spice."
"I had this on tap at a local Applebees. It was served in a weizen glass. It was a hazy orange with a small white head. The aroma was dominated by spices with a hint of citrus zest. The flavor is sweet and dominated by coriander with a citrus backdrop. The beer is light bodied and easy drinking. The style is not my favorite, but this is not a bad beer."
"Not something i would drink on a regular basis but not bad on a hot day if nothing else is available."
"D- Overall a decent Belgian White that falls short of others but is still quite drinkable."
"Served on tap with orange slice. The apperance is a cloudy golden orange color. You cannot see through the glass due to the opaque color. Minimal head and soapy lace. The smell is a very faint aroma of citrus and wheat. Not much to speak of on the smell. The taste is a blend of well ballanced flavors. There are hints of wheat, yeast, barley, citrus, and spices. The mouth feel is a major strong point. The beer has a very pleasant tingle on your tounge and is very carbonated. I find this beer very drinkable and is well ballanced. This is a good summer beer."
"Drinkable but I feel it smells better than it tastes. I do drink it from time to time, depending what else is on tap."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Easy to enjoy, great with burgers, pizza, and just plain drinking."
"Overall: I just feel that it's much better on-tap, seems to have a lot more flavor."
"Decent atmosphere. Distinctive nose and palette. Tastes pretty much like it smells. The orange is integrated without really making the brew sweet. Light and drinkable. Overall, solid quaff."
"The brew is amateur, at best. Its not terrible but its far from spectacular."
"Overall not a bad choice when there's nothing better but nothing worth seeking out."
"A good mellow beer, well-bodied and easy drinking."
"Had on tap, poured yellowish orangy color. really smooth going down. tasted a little fruity, actually it tasted like fruity pebbles cereal to me. But still I thought this was a pretty decent brew anyway, especially for a coors product! I would definitley have this again...but honestly I would have to not have the best of selections like I did tonight."
"Served in a nonic. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a half inch off-white head that quickly dispersed into a swirl of foam that coalesced around the edges. No lacing present during the session. Subtle nose; wheat, orange peel and muted spice. Taste consistent with nose. Flavors suggest presence of corriander and a light, peppery quality. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and lively. Easy drinking and flavorful for the abv; however, somewhat on the blander side of the style."
"D- A lot of people rip on this beer, but I find it to be very refreshing. There are obviously better witbier's then Blue Moon, but it's not the worst one that I've had either."
"D - It is a drinkable beer, but I won't be screaming down to the packy for it any time soon. It's on tap at a local sports bar I frequent, so I have it every now and again. I just thought I would finally review it after my friend ordered it tonight."
"D- Easy to drink, but the spices in the nose are a bit overpowering"
"D - Pretty good beer but the prickly mouthfeel is a let down."
"-The best thing related to Coors brewing... (it's easy when there is sooo many bad things..)"
"D: Somewhat drinkable. I don't know why everyone keeps raving about this beer (it is, after all, from Coors)... don't they realize there's much better Belgian alternatives out there?"
"A bit thin as far as a typical witbier would be concerned but this is surprisingly good considering the source. I wouldn't expect much from Coors but this is far from disappointing. It actually is fairly refreshing and a good find when you just want a beer at that bar that doesn't have anything else..."
"This beer pours a promising orange amber with lots of bubbles and a small white head. Strong citrus orange smell (an this is without the standard orange wedge on the glass). The taste however is just not there. I get a sense that I am drinking soda water mixed with coors light. It is very carbonated without any of the promised spice, yeast or complexity. I would not drink this by choice again."
"I buy this brew all the time. It's a decent standby."
"Drinkability: Blue Moon's always a go-to for me in bars where among other BMC brews, Blue Moon is there. And even though Coors makes it, I'll usually go with it if that's the case."
"Pours a bright orange color with white highlights, a small pure white head that settles into a ring. The aroma is tough. To me it smells like rotting vegetables with a blast of coriander and orange peel to cover the stench. I dunno it has a creamy funk aroma which I can't explain in words. This is the brew that turned me off to wit beers. The taste is a bit better but still stinks. Creamy orange peel with coriander and heavy white pepper. No malt or real yeast flavors, just a jumble of forced spices. This tastes like a beer that spoiled, should have an expiration date like that of milk. The feel is light but not watery, fairly soft carbonation; finishes sweet and grossly spicy. I hate to bash a brew but this thing has almost everything I hate. This has never tasted right to me, in the top two of just foul brews. This has literally ruined wit biers for me."
"While often-maligned, the Blue Moon White is actually a decent & drinkable offering that is readily available and nice on a summer's evening. It pours a nice opaque-cloudy yellow with a fluffy heaf that holds onto some spice aroma as well as citrus. The flavor is clean and fresh, leaning towards a mild hefeweisse without the more complex body. Lower on hops, this has more of a yeast-malt taste with lemon & hints of lightly spiced orange potpourri (not overwhelmingly sweet though). Decent, easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"Feel is OK for a beverage but not really for a beer, very odd. Decent drink. if you accept what you're drinking. More of a fancy carbonated orange drink with added alcohol than beer."
"Pour is a hazy light gold with a tiny bit of head and not much lacing to speak of. The smell is mostly yeast with a hint of lemon. Taste is like the smell with the yeast dominating the flavor. The finish is a bit skunky to me, but not offensive. This one is very light on the tongue with crisp carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable brew, but the slightly off, skunky taste is enough to prevent me from having more than one in a sitting."
"D- I highly suggest it. Not usually a fan of beer of this nature (wheats), but would try another make of this"
"So all in all, it's not a groundbreaker. It's everything you'd expect from a Witbier, and nothing to write home about, but it's a perfectly enjoyable beer. If Hoegaarden's not available, this'll be my second-string choice."
"Bottle - poured into shaker glass. Maybe it was how I poured it, but it had nearly a 1 1/2 inch white head. Yellow, orange cloudy appearance. Smooth, fruity and easy going down, almost a ""light"" beer feeling. Not heavy at all, it was alright. Probably more of a summer beer."
"Whatever its aesthetic shortcomings, this beer deserves a hattip for being a gateway beer that leads many people try more interesting microbrews. Serious beer-nerd friends aside, I don't know anyone who has tried Blue Moon and cringed. The cloudy orange color is undeniably attractive, but the white head disappears faster than soda fizz without leaving a trace. Smells mainly of orange citrus, with faint spices and yeastiness in the background. Tastes of sweet wheaty malts backed by orangey hops, but the coriander doesn't come through as well as it does in other witbiers. It's body is medium-light and with a crisp finish that could be more interesting but overall this is drinkable beer that should be shown to macro-drinkers in hopes of stirring their curiosity."
"Drinkability: It certainly has some stuff going for it. It's very easily available, rather drinkable, relatively inexpensive, and isn't altogether dreadful."
"Ok drinkable, if your into this stuff."
"D - This is a witbier I can drink until I grow up to the big boy stuff!...not a true representation but a good start"
"Mouthfeel is flat and thin. There is a little oiliness to the beer, probably from the sediment."
"Overall - I found this to be a horrible attempt at a Belgian Wit beer. If you want a representative of the style, Try Ommegang Witte, St. Bernardus Witbier, or even Hoegaarden. I was extremely disappointed in this beer and wasn't surprised to find that it is made by a macro. Effin wankers."
"D: Very drinkable all year round, especially in the summer. always a decent choice."
"Notes from 7/23/04"
"D: Great solid summer beer, especially for BBQs. Not something I really pick up otherwise."
"drinkability- a very easy drinking beer for anytime of the year."
"Very drinkable , one of my favorites, probably was the first beer that got me into wheat ales, not the best but easily available at most bars"
"Overall - A pretty good witbier (considering it's from Coors).... Nothing groundbreaking but well worth a try..."
"Taste is overpowered with spices. I can't taste hops or beer. It taste like chicken broth and kitchen spices. Horrible beer. Head is alright and appearance is good, but the taste and drinkability is horrible. Smells similar to the taste... bad. Would not recommend to drink at any time or any season."
"Note: I've also had this out of a bottle. While still impressive, on tap is definitely the way to go (in my opinion). But still, when given the choice of many brews or this out of a bottle, I'll take a Blue Moon any day."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a light head. Smells like your traditional grut: orange peel and coriander. Very citrusy with only a hint of beer in the smell. Tastes very refershing. The citrus is there in the form of orange. The hops are subtle if not almost absent. A bit of a lemony aftertaste. It obviously tastes much more like orange if you actually put the orange in it. The mouhtfeel is pretty good. Smooth but doesn't feel too light. About medium carbonation. Easy to throw two or three of these back on a warm day or with the right meal."
"In terms of drinkability, it's fair, but it's not too heavy. Pretty good stuff!"
"This unfiltered wheat ale has an apricot hue when viewed through a glass. There's a prominent citrus flavor present here - oranges come to mind. The consistency is a somewhat thin - perhaps a bit too watery. The brew is certainly easy to drink and tastes good - an above average beer that most people can agree on. As far as wheat ale goes Blue Moon isn't mind blowing, but I have yet to find a cheaper wheat ale of comparable quality."
"Overall a decent attempt at a belgian from a macro. Smells average for a belgian, nothing to strong but meets standards. Some wheat tastes there with a bit of an orange citrus, but an overwhelming carbonic sting destroys any semblance of enjoyment there. A shame, this would have been quality without it, but carbonation once again takes hold of a hopeful macro and flushes it down the toilet."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The carbonation helps with the smoothness of the beer. This isnt a bad beer but I quickly became bored with it."
"D- I had five of these in one sitting once and that was a bad idea. I wouldn't have more than two, maybe three of these in a sitting."
"Reviewed on 4/5/08. On tap at the local unnoteworthy bar. Pours orange with a small white head. Served with an orange slice, which made it hard to pick out the aroma, but I assume it was nothing special. Not many specific tastes to pick out--some spices, a hint of wheat. Easy to drink I suppose. Not really a good example of a witbier, but better than the pale lagers it's served alongside of. 5/4/5/4/12 (3.0/5)"
"very drinkable macrobrew"
"A decent witbier, but there are better once out there. I personally thought shock-top had more flavor and its usually a 50 cents cheaper a 6-pack. Like all witbiers its a good one to sit back and enjoy, and is worth trying with an orange slice in it."
"D- Quite drinkable. A good bet for bars that serve mainly BMC. Some places stick an orange in it, which kills the head, but is good in it's own way."
"I did know that this was a Coors product and for the longest time refused to buy it. However, the price dropped radically and I had to admit that the divine hand of the market was pushing me to try to see past the politics and just see the beer. I did and in all fairness I was not disapointed. The color is good, the foggy non filtered look and aroma was enticing. The flavor was fresh and crisp and the head! Nice! This is not Alagash Belgian White by any means though at 1/3 the price it is quite appealing. So there. I tried it and liked it. Beer makes for a wonderful common ground!"
"Pours a pale yellow with a slight clarity, reminding me of lemonade. Two finger white, creamy head. Not much nose, all I could gather was cereal grains. Taste was a lot of citruis and cereal grains (wheaty like a hefeweizen). Flavor was very bland. Light and crisp on the tongue, thin texture. Average beer, but disappointed as a ""belgian style."" Flavor was not there, not recommended as a session beer."
"I will always have a soft spot for this beer though, because it was my gateway beer. This was the first beer I drank and liked drinking. I very rarely drink it now, finding it way too sweet and orangey, but I do appreciate its role in my beerevolution."
"Made by Coors, which automatically drops it in my opinion, which is unfortunate. I wish it had a better label, because I might rate it higher. (Honesty is good, right?)"
"Taste: Best served really cold. I had a bottle when it was just under room temp and it wasn't a nice experience."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-orange color body, with a quickly diminishing off-white head, citrus spice aroma, (with orange slice added), very carbonated citrus flavor, spices, not very complex palate, wheaty taste."
"Blue Moon is a beer I would have no problem buying again, especially when warmer weather returns."
"not bad but when compared to southhampton double white, blanche de chambly,wittereke, St Bernardous, allagash white, and numerous others... im not gonna grab for the blue moon"
"Finish was smooth, aftertaste, barely there. I like this beer and I think is a good starter for me to learn about beer in general. its not Budweiser and while its from Coors it certainly doesnt taste like their usual offerings which i cant stand. For me its a good starter beer and worth drinking repeatedly."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Creamy and sweet, medium in body and pleasantly spiced. Very yeasty, with notes of banana bread becoming more prominent as it warms. Not a hint of bitterness, nor any dryness in the finish; this is fairly flatline and a bit too sweet for the style, though it's inoffensive overall. I can see this being a decent gateway beer."
"Wow. Where to start in my panning of this beer. I guess in a sentence I would say that this is 1) not a witbier in any sense of the word, and 2) tastes so bad that it's offensive and insulting. There is zero taste, zero spiciness, and no trace of ""coriander and orange peel"" whatsoever. Instead, I get a salty gulp of swill with a greasy, slick mouthfeel. Couldn't even finish the beer! Awful. If I could give this 0.5 out of 5.0, I would."
"I would consider this beer to be one of Coors' better products, although it really isn't close to an actual Belgian White. It has a hazy, yellowish color and has a fruity aroma, characterized mostly by orange. The taste is also dominated by orange, which makes it somewhat sweet. This beer is very easy to drink and very crisp. I usually turn to Blue Moon when looking for a decent macro beer in bottles."
"The appearance is cloudy gold/white with an typical head for the style. The aroma is citrusy/lemony, with wheat, yeast, and spice. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is thin but OK for the style. For a macro I really like this beer. It has a touch of macro twang but not too much."
"m&d: very light mouthfeel helped by slight carbonation. This is an extremely drinkable beer. I know it is produced my a Macro Brewery, but this is a refreshing beer. Defenitaly recomend."
"***This just in, had this beer the other night at a pizza joint. They included a slice of orange with the glass and that simple slice brought out and tied all the flavors together...with the orange, I'd raise the taste category to a 4.5."
"D - very good, would actually buy this beer and drink 6 pack at a social gathering. It is refreshing and does not have bad aftertaste."
"Bottom line...a quality craft brew from an American macro brewer that is enjoyable but not quite at the same level as the top beers in this style. I would strongly recommend this to someone that is a macro drinker but is starting to show more curiosity towards craft beer."
"its almost drinkable, light but not outstanding, absolutely nothing about this beer stands out."
"This could be a decent session beer. There is nothing, however, to excite the palate in the way I would want. It's an enjoyable brew but leaves much to desire."
"Goes very smooth down your throat and leaves a rich nutty aftertaste. Mild carbonation, does not distract from the taste. One of my new favorite beers."
"drinkability: It's heavy and I can't seem to drink very many"
"Smooth, although I would not say creamy. Sweet and citrus, you can taste the wheat and yeast (in a good way). Crisp and refreshing, usually served with an orange slice. Some cinnamon in there. Very drinkable. This beer gets a bad rap, probably because it is corporate, but I like it. I do get annoyed when it is listed as a more expensive ""import"" on menus. It is not a beer to study, but it is something you can order at most places when out with friends and enjoy, without requiring a boat from belgium and a glass most people will give funny looks too. At many restaurants/bars it is (sadly) the best option."
"I dislike Coors products but was pleased with this one. Easy drinkablity, better with a slice of orange, which isn't available in all bars. (lemon is an adequate substitute in such circumstances) Goes well with pizza or a burger (as long as it's not a veggie) has recently been made available as a longneck (24oz bottle) in case you don't want to invest in a 6pk or can buy it individually or sample it at your local bar. Not as good as true Belgian beers but for the price, better than expected."
"A really nice brew. Even though this a Coors brew, it is quite nice. A nice brew to serve at the summer picnics. Introduce some of your family and friends to craft brews with this one. It is easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is average at best. The only reason I didn't give it lower scores is that there are no off flavors or smells so I assume this is what Coors was shooting for. I see why it might appeal to some but in my opinion, why bother."
"D - If it weren't for the visual presentation of this, I could have this as my regular wheat ale. Visual detracts from it greatly."
"Overall, a decent beer that is quite drinkable. Not an exceptional Wit, but good choice if can't find the Belgian alternatives."
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing ale that I will definately buy again. This is ideal for a hot summer day, perhaps while on a picnic or after working in the yard. I highly recommend this to anyone into this style of beer."
"D--> I was pretty impressed with how slick this beer was and it is now one of my top 10 beer as a ""chaser"" beer after having a beer dark as oil! :-) Could be a little on the ""weak"" side...but wheat beers have that presence anyway and it serves well for its domain. :-) One thing for sure....this is the ONLY beer worth drinking from Coors!"
"D - Give me a hammock and a six-pack. Beer judges: This one was worthy of the final table, am sorry for doubting you. Their reformulation: awesome. Seriously. Puts Allagash White and others in their place."
"This is definetly one of my favorite beers. Served with an orange, it's a pretty cloudy but citrus-y in flavor as most people know or would assume. Very drinkable, very pleasantly unique taste. Far and away the best idea Coors has ever had. I would recommend it to anyone but if someone is used to a light beer, the 5.4% ABV may throw you off at first."
"Goes down smoothly, and easy to see why this is so popular in the US."
"Not that good of an example of the style, but it does show some of the characteristics of the style and is better than anything else brewed by Coors."
"For a macro imitating a micro, this is not a bad beer at all. Something I fall back on often when the picking is not up to snuff."
"Very drinkable beer, although one that left me a little unenthused. Quite pleasant for a hot day here in Northern California."
"Why do people like this? It such an uninteresting beer. Sure, its got more flavor that a Coors Light, but come on. And served with an orange? It tastes terrible that way. Aroma is almost non-existent, except for hints of malt and fruit. Taste is similar. Feel is watery, but not terrible. I'm tired of people thinking this is good beer."
"A nice orange color with a nice head, citrus odors, and hints of lemon the flavor was very nice. As I said, I had a few so it was certainly drinkable. Not bad for a Coors product!"
"A good buy."
"drinks very easy, goes down nice, i really enjoyed this beer, great with the orange slice it really adds a lot from just drinking it out of a bottle, great beer."
"Drink: I won't buy it again, but it could be an alright summer beer at a bar with no choices. Worth trying."
"Huge orange peel on the lip of course. Poured a hazed pale orange color with a nice white head. Smelled of citrus and wheat. Tasted of pretty much the same thing. The orange flavor was big but definitely back by the solid smooth wheat flavor. Went down very easy.. could of easily had another. Try it!"
"An incredibly easy-drinking beer, great as a thirst-quencher but could use a bit more body. Still, this is one of those beers from a mass-market company that you just can't knock, no matter how hard you try -- and that's a good thing, in my opinion."
"Something I would drink in the summer, and that's about it. Not too terribly excited about this beer."
"looks very nice in the glass--lovely colour, and nice head. unfortunately, let down by the taste and non-existent finish. slight citrusy notes, and a hint of bitterness as it enters the mouth, but by the time you've finished swallowing it you might as well have had a sip of water. but this does make it a very good thirst quencher after a hot, humid day as we've had today in southern minnesota."
"Overall: Not the best North American interpretation of a belgain wit but definately one I could more than one of in a sitting."
"My first attempt in not drinking a straight BMC lager and to ths day this beer still impresses me. One of the best Wit's I've had and even though its mass produced it still tastes great every time I have it. I love seeing my friends transitioning towards beers like this which have 10 X the taste of Bud or Bud Light."
"This poured a hazy straw yellow with white head. It smelled like sour lemon and standard Belgian wild yeast, and some salt. It tasted like creamy lemon and orange hops, with wild Belgian yeast and wheat malt. It was watery with some carbonation, with a faint sour aftertaste. Overall this was not bad for a generic wheat ale. It had surprisingly decent flavor and body, and therefore drinkability. Perhaps it's generic composition is better suited for me, since I'm not a wheat ale fan."
"Overall a good, drinkable beer."
"This'll pair well with food; a great summer party sipper. Not a bad offering from Coors."
"D= A bit too sweet for a Belgian style wit in my opinion, but a great beer to wash down pizza and burgers nonetheless."
"D: Very, very drinkable. Good for picnics, as a summer quencher, or with food (especially standard American fare like pizza and burgers). Can drink this all day."
"A dirty/cloudy look to it but poured with a decent head. Citrus, lemon flavor but it was pretty smooth. Pretty refreshing on a 90 degree day (which it was). They served it with an orange slice on the glass though. Why? It's already got PLENTY of citrus taste to it! My buddy threw the orange in the drink and did regret that. I can certainly see this being one that the non beer drinking females may like."
"D: Really easy to drink a lot, but I'm thinking clories wouild catch up to me."
"Poured from a bottle in to a 14oz mug. Surprisingly nice head and typical cloudy color. Actually looks pretty nice. Smells good. I like the taste and agree it's a bit better than your typical macro. This is a good beer to introduce your BMC friends to something good even though it's a Coors product."
"A decent session beer; I could enjoy several in a sitting with minimal intoxication. A good alternative to some of the standard beers available in stores and restaurants (e.g. Sam Adams, Harpoon, etc.)."
"D: A decent session beer, but nothing extraordinary. Not as complex as I like from this style."
"Drinkability: Not a standout belgian wheat, but not a terrible one either. A really easy drinking beer for sitting outside on a nice day."
"blue moon definetely deserves some respect as for many it is one of the first beers you try that actually has some taste. As far as the style goes it is pretty average. It's pour is cloudy yellow/amber with a foamy head. Flavor and aroma both have a hint of citrus but are mainly wheat. It's easy to drink, which is it's greatest strength. It may not be anything special once you learn more about the style, but, again, due to it's wide availability it is often the most interesting beer available at many bars (the only alternative to bud or such), so ts probably responsible for bringing many into the world of craft beers. Ok whatever.. Anyone reading this has tried it and knows all this already anyway."
"Guess I just don't have much to say about this one. Oh well, what's next?"
"D: Not the best witbier I've ever had, but definitely tasty, one of my favorite session beers when on tap as well. 4.0"
"I really love this beer. When I drink one of these I picture myself on the bayou eating some crawdads and corn on the cob on a calm summer night. Ok anyway. This is a good wheat beer. You can get it anytime too which makes this a winner. It comes with a nice white creamy head and had a golden cloudy color. It is nicely carbonated. It has a nice citrus aroma. The flavor is very refreshing with the flavors of the orange peel and coriander giving it a zest and a spicy like aftertaste. It is an easy refreshing drinker."
"Drinkability: We got a keg of this for a party we had over the weekend because we knew everyone would like it. Not a great wit, but definitely a great crowd-pleaser. Enjoyable for just about anyone."
"I really enjoy the Belgian style Witbiers and have been trying any that can be found. This was the third one I have had and it didn't dissapoint. It is the easiest to find and therefore I believe it must be one of the most mass produced of this style. The spices and citrus flavors balanced well, in fact I think they balanced too well. The appearance was great, I love the fact that this is an unfiltered wheat beer. I have had better from other breweries and I don't think that the high price of this beer justifies the total flavor. I will only buy this again if no others can be found."
"Pours a hazy pale orange with a thin bright white head. Decent retention. Aroma is weak, but some citrus is there with not much else. Taste is ok. A citrusy note up front with some bready malt finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a generous carbonation tingle. Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol makes this beer sessionable. However, it is a terrible example of the style."
"D - Very high drinkability. For a Coors product, this is a very exceptional brew, and probably the cheapest example of this style on the market. I could drink this stuff all night."
" My guess is this beer could not offend many people with it's simple and adequate taste."
"This one will probably remain an old standby while I search through many other styles and brands. Good, easy to find, not too much thinking involved."
"The aroma is of orange peels and spices. The taste is yeasty most of the way through. You get some decent bitterness on the back end and is a crisp beer. It is pretty refreshing but not overly complex. It would be a multiple brew day in the hot sun."
"or on the tongue some hints of citrusy stuff, a really pallid representation of a witbier. Hints of flavor, just enough to make you think that something is going to happen, but it never does. Tried this because the rest of the beer list at the restaurant was even worse. Never again."
"Overall, the bottled format gives the beer some sour notes and a little acridity that aren't desired or present in the draft form. It's not a bad beer by any means, but I definitely prefer to have this one on tap."
"Pours a very hazy golden with an actually very nice head that retains pretty well. Smells of lemon, citrus/orange, yeast, phenols, flowery, and a bit soapy too. Taste is more yeast, fruity at the beginning then gets very thin very quickly. Semi-off taste in the finish. Not bad, but not great either. Lemongrass, more soapy flavors, melon. Mouthfeel is pretty crabonated and medium bodied, crisp, and pretty refreshing. Pretty drinkable for what it's worth but I can get better for the same price."
"Poured a cloudy golden color, with 1 finger of white head that left a slight lacing. The smell was of some citrus and a little yeast. Quite a bit of carbonation, citrus, and orange peel round out the taste of this beer. Not bad for a massed produced beer. Good for a hot day, or when your looking to have more than 1 or 2."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a nice two-finger head that slowly fades leaving behind some surprisingly nice lacing. Smell is spicy and sweet. Taste is sweet, lots of wheat malt in play, backed up by coriander spice, and gets sweet again on the finish. Medium bodied, very smooth on the tongue. Probably the best macro beer you'll find."
"This beer reminds me of my intramural basketball days. Even though I tried to take on the big boys, I came up short, couldn't finish the job; nonetheless, my coach would slap me on the ass after the game followed by a suave wink. I slap this beer on the ass. I dig the tangerine peel floating on the surface of the pineapple juice. The oats provide a perfect atmosphere for the notes to suspend. Unfortunately, Blue Moon is inexperienced. He's the dude that slips the condom on when his penis is soft...he knew what he wanted to do, just couldn't execute in the end. Better luck next time, tiger."
"The look and smell of this beer is pretty damn good. A pineapple-like juice color and sweet fruity smell make you feel like you aren't at home but rather at the beach baking in the sun. With that said I think this beer is great for the summer. On a hot day, this Belgian White could be more refreshing than water, just the thing to quench a sun-burnt body. At any other time of year, this beer may not be the first on the shopping list but in the season of hot women and hotter weather this is the go-to beer. Due to the lightness of this beer don't be afraid to notice the 5.4% alcohol content. It'll sneak up on ya before you know it. So sit back in your lounge chair and enjoy."
"A nice witbier for sure. Not the best in the world but very pleasant."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, with a strong invitation to open another bottle or three."
"Drinkability is ok, while the orange peel is a bit strong, it's not overwhelming or cloying, and light enough that you can suck em down with ."
"I had this out of a keg at the Mensa AG in Denver, CO. Color is a nice golden amber. The sample I had was quite foamy, but this is probably a result of the way in which it was served. Aroma was nice with a good mix of hops and malt. Flavor, though tasty, was rather thin - there is a nice balance of hops and malt and a hint of citrus, but it seemed watery. Texture was pleasantly smooth but watery. Again, this could have been a result of the serving method."
"This is definitely a beer that you could drink all night and not get sick of it. This is one of my all time favorites."
"up to this level- they would really be on to something."
"i really didnt think i would like this beer since i first looked at it, pour it into a glass, it had a white body with a thin rice head wich tasted like bue moon didnt put any effort into there product, the smell didnt impress me either, this beer all around just wasnt up to par."
"mouthfeel is bitter, malty, seems heavier than most wheat beers gravity wise, nice texture, and the orangeish flavor is nicely complimenting."
"D - Good beer."
"Pours orange yellow with nice fluffy white head. Some spice in the aroma-coriander? No hops-not expecting any. Taste is sweet with a strong citrus orange flavor. Finishes is nice and quenching. Carbonation is medium and mouthfeel reflects this. Drinkability is very good-nice beer for the summer-wanted to hate but can't"
"Poured a cloudy orange color with a solid 1 inch head that dissipated slowly. Aroma was fruity with a slight whiff of cloves in the nose. Not bad so far. Taste was quite sweet up front with a good bit of spices mixed in. Lots of herbal flavors mixed in too. The finish was slightly tart and some more of the fruit became noticeable(orange maybe?) at the end. This is pretty good stuff coming from a macro and really hit the spot on a hot afternoon. It was also the only decent brew as the establishment I was in made light American lagers the only other draft choices available."
"D: I ordered a second"
"M/D: A bit prickly, on the lighter side of medium. Very drinkable. This is actually a pretty decent beer. Nothing to be thumb your nose at just because you know who makes it. A solid offering and probably the best of the Blue Moon series."
"interesting scent, wheat, some banana. First taste, instantly thought bananas the fruit, not the candy. Tastes like a wheat beer, not too original. Smooth and very drinkable. Far from being my favorite witbier, but not too bad for a molson-coors product."
"Drinkability is just average. I would take it over just about any macro lager, but witbier is not my favorite style. Overall, a typical brew from a large producer."
"Though a lighter beer, oats in grist as well as the wheat produce a slick, oily mouth-feel and light carbonation lighten this to a very quaffable, refreshing beer. Solid."
"This is a cloudy golden color and has a whitish head. The nose and taste are both quite light for the style, but have good balance. There is a good amount of wheat malt with some faint citrus flavors. The clean body has lots of carbonation. A decent wheat beer that goes down well enough."
"drinkability: Very drinkable. would buy again"
"Crisp and thin-bodied with refreshing carbonation. Nice dry finish."
"M/D - Medium bodied and a little chewy. Very drinkable white."
"D: Very. As far as a beer from a macro, this is a hit. A good brew that is very easy to get your hands on. Good beer for a six pack type of day."
"D- Being that this can be found on tap most places now, VERY. Not much else when out appeals to me so I drink it often. (the orange garnish makes a nice snack/bonus too, but not in the beer)"
"served sans garnish. despite being a bmc product, i can't let that lower my scores on this one. it's a decent example of a witbier. on the more colorful end for the style, this is a hazy glowing orange in color with a big creamy white head and lacing. looks like a german wheat, actually. requisite aromas of orange peel and fresh bread, with maybe a hint of spice and honey. nice bready malt sweetness is rounded out by some coriander spice and a bit of sourness. hops a very minor player here as per the style. big, chewy mouthfeel for a wit and a natural feeling, creamy carbonation. refreshing enough."
"Smell is heavy on the citrus especially orange with a touch of malt and wheat. Taste is full of malt and orange peel. Didnt linger long in the mouth. Mouthfeel was good with heavy carbonation and an overall light feeling. This is a very drinkable beer."
"this is my favorite beer, its a cloudy look means its a good wheat beer. it goes down very smooth. it had a unique smell to it so you can tell its blue moon. you get less of a head hen non wheat beers. it is a great beer for a good price. the main thing to remember when drinking blue moon is to have an orange slice with it"
"Overall a very nice one. Very refreshing and great for summer. Also surprised this is a Coors product."
"If you get a chance order up an eclipse. Its like a black and tan but with Blue moon and Guinness. Very tasty!"
"Sweetness into grain into spicy orange notes. Man I want one now!"
"I've already reviewed this beer in the bottle (reviewed on April 21, 2008). Well, Blue Moon is even better, and more delicious, on tap. Virtually every aspect of the beer is enhanced when ordering it on tap as opposed to drinking it out of the bottle. Definitely my choice of beer whenever I'm out for a drink and some eats."
"While the taste on this was okay, I felt it was too sweet for me to enjoy. Not enough backbone and way overboard on the spices."
"D - I'm always able to put several of these back. Overall the beer is smoother and the flavors are more balanced. Alcohol is kept more in check compared to the bottles as well, making it not such an intense beer."
"Blue Moon pours yellow orange and hazy. A thick and creamy smooth head forms which leaves behind some lacing that slowly slides down the sides of the glass. The texture is smooth and a little oily. Its aroma is light with orange and wheat notes. The favor is a nice mix of sweet orange peel, coriander and wheat malts. The finish is wheaty and a little dry. Blue Moon is very refreshing and drinkable. I like to enjoy it with a slice of orange. [orange slice was not used for review]"
"D - Drinkability is average. The beer has a clean taste but remains a little too bland in most categories. The spicy flavors in the aftertaste really saved this one from being a less than average beer."
"This is a very drinkable brew, one that could be a nice session beer on a warm afternoon."
"Poured a golden tan with a very foamy head. Smelled pretty pleasant being slightly fruity. It tasted like a wheaty/banana-ish hefeweizen and was pretty decent. It was my first experience with blue moon and although wheat beers aren't usually my thing, this was pretty enjoyable and drinkable."
"All and all not a bad beer,. Tastes fruitier on tap then it does when you drink it from a bottle. The color is a brownish orange. The taste is tangy and fruity almost like a ripe orange. Mouthfeel is smooth and sudsy. The smell was that ripe fruit. It'd be easy to go a couple of rounds on this beer. Shocked that something of this caliber came from Coors."
"D - Pretty good level of drinkability here. I would suggest always taking the optional orange in there. This brew needs it, too bland without it. Adds a nice authentic citrusy effect to it. Definitely better whites out there, easily, but for the availability and the price it is usually a better choice than most other macros."
"Overall, sometimes the best option when you are out at a bar. But it didn't grab me as being something that I would go out of my way to find."
"A very smooth drink with a slight bitter finish at the end. I used to not like this beer at all, but it has grown on me quite a bit. Can definitely taste the citrus, orange hint. Hence it being served with an orange slice at most bars. Definitely a good go-to beer at a bar which might not have much other selection."
"I was surprised to find out that this was a Coors product but c'est la vie. I ordered it for the first time at a cool hookah bar in Fort Myers, FL. Served in a tall pilsener glass iced cold with an orange slice. Appearantly this is the prime way to enjoy it. Looks very cloudy orangish color. Smells of mild wheat and citrus undertones. Taste of fine yeast esters with hint of orange and grains. Not a bad sipper"
"This beer pours a hazy pale orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes rather quickly for a wheat beer into thin lacing. The aroma is of orange peel and lemons with a corny, adjunct backbone. The taste has a lot of bland maltiness, with almost no orange peel or lemon. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a very poor example of the witbier. I will not drink this again."
"This is a good summer beer, but definitely not of the same class as say a St. Bernardus Witbier."
"Poured into a goblet. Light in color even for the style, with a fizzy white head that recedes without leaving behind any lacing. Aroma is lemony and wheaty, with maybe a touch of spice. Pretty average. Tastes watered down, with the predictable citrus and grain. Seriously lacking the complexity that makes, say, St. Bernardus Witbier so great. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and thin. High drinkability."
"MF&D - Thin bodied, crisp and refreshing. A good effort at the Belgian White style of ale from a macro brewery. A good summer session ale."
"drinkability - very drinkable since its light and sweet. no wonder this is the go to beer for sorority girls.."
"A decent American imitation of a Belgian Witbier. This is certainly the best thing Coors makes. The tour-guide at the brewery said it's their fastest-growing beer. Sadly, 70% of what they sell is still Coors light. Oh well."
"This is a summer beverage, one drank by the pool. I have had both with and without the slice of orange. It poors with a decent color, small head. Not a beer thats going to over impress or offend. The orange added maked it feel like that summer pool beer, which is a good thing considering the average flavor. I am looking forward to trying their seasonal ""rising moon"" which I picked up tonite for our next beer club meeting."
"D: Not bad, not great, but a decently refreshing beer, easy drinking and pretty light. A little boring but a pretty solid offering especially from one of the big boys."
"A pleasant surprise coming from Coors. The first time I had this I didn't know it was actually made by them, goes to show that they can put out a good product."
"This beer is pretty good. A better ""supermarket beer"" is hard to find. It is kind of like a beginners Oberon."
"The beer was light to medium bodied with a slightly chewy feel, with good carbonation. A decent beer that I considered my ghetto Hoegaarden. I have had it in bottle form on many occasions and found it much better than this tap. I have to get another bottle and review it. Worth trying and definitely able to be sessioned. Good summertime brew."
"Having acquired a taste for beer later in life, I like trying a wide variety. I usually find the beers I like receiving very low grades her on BA, but Blue Moon actually surprised me: I like it and apparently many other beer reviewers feel the same. It's like a very sweet dessert beer with a strong taste of Fruit Loops. Apparently that's the Corriander which is common in Belgium beer. I like it. Actually I'm sitting around tonight watching March madness and my first couple of bottles were really nice. About the therd or forth bottel the games got reely boring and it lookt like the players were in runnin in slo motien. Cents I was board of the games I de sided to go ahead and phinnish off the whole six pack. Wow, that's a nice bbbeer, but i'm typing allot ssloer now. But, at leest i can still tipe..."
"D: It may be a bit heavy for a long session but it was a nice alternative to a hefeweizen (many similar characteristics...except a lemon/citrus highlight rather than a banana/white fruit profile."
"It has a very cloudy appearance in the glass, but a nice yellow color. A very nice aroma, very citrusy -made more so by the orange slice that came with it. It is a very drinkable beer, much better than the majority of Coors products. All in all a very fine session beer, especially on a hot day in the shade."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It is a golden color with a head that dissipates very quickly. The nose is zesty, citrusy cabbage is the way I would like to describe it. The taste is malt forward followed by slight hop and sour finish. The mouth feel is a little too bubbly and harsh for the beer. It would make a nice brew for a few in a sitting."
"It is a good standard for draft beer when the resteraunt has nothing else but the standards, ""Bud, Lite, etc."""
"boy i can't tell you how many times i here people refer to this stuff as their favorite imported beer.... for shame. while not a bad beer, i certainly can't see how it could be someones favorite. the look is good, has a nice haziness to it and a nice white foamy head that laces a little bit. smell is kinda weak, but average. has some weak citrus hints to it. taste is average to, nothing jumps out at ya, but it is pretty good for something from coors. it isn 't a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, and i assume that if it gets peoples minds open about beer, then it does a good job doing that."
"Opaque yellow cloudy beer with lots of fine bubbles rising to the top and a moderate head. Smells OK... But there's an earthy sour type of smell present. Kind of grainy. Maybe wheat. Or perhaps that corriander that the label states is in there. Tastes much as it smells but slightly better and with a slight fruity presence. And a cereal-like Fruity Pebbles aftertaste. Not bad for Coors but I've had WAY better Witbiers.... Better than plain Coors or anything like that for sure, however."
"""Hey bartender, do me a favor and keep your pansy orange slice!"""
"Appearance is a great cloudy almost opaque white, spice and wheat can be seen settling. Smell has hints of orange and lavender, topped with floral notes. Wheat lingers in the background. Taste is citrusy, mostly orange, with creamy and thick wheat settling on the tongue. Micro-bubbles coat the tongue in a very pleasant way. Leaves minimal malt on tongue, and really leaves just a creamy, rich wheaty-powdery taste. Really one of my favorite all around beers. One of the most well balanced, appetizing, and easy to drink and enjoy beers I have ever had. Exceptionally great in spring and summer, but good year round. A."
"Overall, a fun beer that's a nice sideshow during a summer get-together."
"not too bad actually good from where it comes in my opinion just ok"
"The very cloudy appearance is due to the fact that it is an un-filtered wheat ale. I think the taste is splendid and very refreshing, especially on a hot evening."
"D: A nice, somewhat spicy wheat beer with a smooth feel. Easy to drink and great on a summer evening."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. One of the best mass produced beers I have had."
"If your trying to find a good belgian white beer, and i know how difficult this can be, especially when your areas stores have a small, mainstream selection, definately go with Blue Moon, you shouldn't be disapointed. Blue Moon is easily my second favorite brew to date, under Blance De Chambly."
"Pours a clouded orange. Small white head. Nose is dirty and kind of skunky. Flavor is citrus and grass. A little too dirty on the backside though. Feel has a decent carbonation to it and the liquid body is a tad thin. Overall not bad for a mass production. But certainly won't go down as my favorite witbier of all time."
"D: Much more drinkable than other wheat beers"
"This is a good beer. I enjoyed it was served with a medium white head and an orange, cloudy body. The taste was very pleasant and even with citrus and coriander giving way to fresh wheat. Is it wrong to prefer this Coors product to the less consistent Hoegaarden?"
"This is true to style, but does not have anything that is memoriable. A nice direction from the macros and not a bad beer. It compliments a meal very good and is easy to drink. There are far better wits out there, but this is still worth a try."
"D: The abv is low and the flavor is distinct enough that I could get through a pint or two."
"M&D: The carbonation is relatively light but enough to be spry on the tongue and that certainly adds additional character to the citrus and spice flavor."
"Buy it and try it."
"D - Extremely easy to drink. Easily sessionable and a great intro to non-American Standard Lagers for bad beer drinkers."
"Pours a cloudy orange juice color with a bit of head. Tastes like a slightly lighter hefeweizen with the same traditional flavors. I'm not a big hefeweizen fan, so this isn't my favorite. Has that clove spiced taste youd expect. Ok, but if I were to drink this I'd add lemon or orange to cut some of that clove flavor I don't care for."
"The best and most classic of the Blue Moon line is their witbier. Although it's become very trendy to get this at bars and have at parties, (like the Stella craze), it IS a good beer, unlike the other ""Belgian"" beer just mentioned, and this one is made in America, and at friggin' COORS no less! Give it up for Blue Moon."
"D: Easy drinkin', not much thinkin'. I'm not a fan of Blue Moon and I wouldn't recommended it to someone interested in craft/non-BMC brews, but taken for what it is I'd drink it over other Coors products."
"Update: I thought this review was funny, so i am leaving the text the same. I had another, and while I still don't like it, I don't hate it as much. I updated my numbers."
"I prefer this ale as a change of pace and to me it is better than your run of the mill - Hefe's. or unfiltered wheat brews."
"D: You can and I have drank this all day long. Good macro produced beer that non craft people are into. Give it up to Molson."
"Drinkability is better than average, and throw a slice a lemon on top and stop worrying about your image, it adds a great element to Blue Moon."
"Paid $6.99 US at a local convenience store. Well crafted brew with a subtle taste profile. Pours cloudy light orange with about 3/4 inch of head. Modest amount of lacings. Very smooth taste but little in the hop department. A good transition beer from macro to craft beer. First time for a witbier. May buy again but only occasionally."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color with a frothy three-finger head. The smell is pretty typical of a wheat beer with some grains and yeast and just a hint of spices. The taste is slightly sweet with a definite citrus quality and finishes smooth with a bit of spiciness. This isn't the most complex witbier out there, but it makes a pretty good effort. It has a fairly energetic carbonation that leads to a rather pleasant mouthfeel and the beer's light taste makes for very good drinkability."
"American version of a witbier, that in Long Island NY has become all the rage. On one hand I am glad a Begian White - non-""normal"" beer like Bud, Miller, etc - is becoming popular. On the otherhand, this is not a very good beer. I find it quite ordinary. The fruity smell/taste is a bit overpowering for me. Must be coriander or the like. And the normal serving is to put a slice of orange in it, which to me makes it even more fruity in a bad way. I find that if I drink more than 3 of these I start getting an unpleasant aftertaste. Hours afterwards I still have that fruity taste in my mouth. Again, it is an average beer, not horrible, but I would much rather drink another Belgian White, or a good hefeweizen."
"Poured out a super hazy gold beer with a big fluffy head. I poured out the sediment also,,tons of yeast floaties.Lightly scented citrusy scent. Taste is light slightly sweet with a mild lemon taste to it. Not bad. Mouth feel is pretty good. Excellent drinkabilty,,a light brew i could drink quite a bit of."
"This American witbier has a cloudy, amber appearance just like others of its ilk. It has a fruity smell, rich in oranges, though it doesn't exactly overhwelm the nose. You can taste the oranges prevalently, but it doesn't have the complexity of St. Bernardus' Witbier, to give an example. It has a vibrant mouthfeel common to this beer. Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer (surprising it's made by Coor's) and it goes down eacy, though it's not exactly cream of the crop."
"Drinkability is very nice. I could (and have) drank many of these in one sitting."
"It's not overly heavy or acidic like some similar beers, making it easy to have more than one for us lushes. It's a pretty good take on a different style of beer. Worth having around every now and then."
"This poured nicely and looked beautiful. It smelled like a wheat, with hints of citrus and wheat coming out. It tasted a little citrusy, however it was pretty watery, with a wheaty aftertaste. This was an all right beer...a little too watery for my tastes. However, it is very easy to take down."
"I have a special affection for Blue Moon because it was the first beer I drank (after my undergrad days) and thought, ""Wow, beer can actually taste good."" Tasty, refreshing orange flavor. However, I think I burned myself out on this one after way too many two for one mugs at Chili's. A good ""starter"" beer for those who aren't normally beer drinkers."
"Yes, this is a macro version of my favorite Belgian style, but it isn't bad. It has a nice body and gives a good head, and there is some yeast and wheat evident in the smell. Has a smooth body, and the taste does offer up a little citrus and some sweetness. A little watery for my taste, but some bars like to put these on special and I order one from time to time (I hate when they put the orange slice in it though)."
"The head is nice, the mouthfeel is OK but the taste is what I can't get past. I am told this is the fastest growing beer in sales. I would drink other macros first. I never thought I would say that. Especially when I am a wheat beer lover."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable, but tame. Nothing takes it over the top."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow, almost white color. It has a thick white head that sticks to the sides of the glass. It has an aroma of some wheat malts, some light hops, and some fruity aromas. The taste is OK. It has a sweet wheat taste followed by a fruity/bitter aftertaste. It is pretty good for a witbier and it has a good mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. It is a very drinkable beer and it's nice with an orange slice in it. Worth a try."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, pours a hazy golden color with a white head and a lot of little particles floating around. smell is not very strong but is definitley sweet and citrusy. taste is really sweet and citrusy. mouth is medium bodied and smooth, this beer is way too sweet for me but one or two would be refreshing on a hot summer day."
"D: Very Drinkable, especially for a Coors. smooth and goes down easy. Overall easy to drink."
"I'm really glad nobody told me this beer was made by Coors before I tried it. Otherwise, I would have probably missed out on what turns out to be a great beer that is readily available. Probably the best Coors brewed beer IMO."
"D- Very drinkable"
"D- I wanted to try this again just at the off chance the waitress brought me the wrong beer when I had it on tap. I was always hesitant to try this before since it is brewed by one of the big American micro breweries. I am very glad I did try it, and tried it again It may not be the best example of the style nor the best beer out there, but all in all it is very good. I have had a couple and I am thinking that this might be one of my staple beers during the summer. It is refreshing and very easy to drink."
"D - I was surprised with how decent this beer is coors actually has something thats drinkable"
"D I can certainly see having a few of these in an evening."
"Overall, this is a good brew with a good price."
"Note: If in Florida, a slice of fresh orange goes well in this. Unlike Corona though, the fruit isn't necessary to make it drinkable."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow, pretty hazy with a thin white head and good carbonation. Smell is of orange primarily with wheat and light spices underneath. Taste is much of the same. A little coriander in there and even the slightest hint of blueberries. Mouthfeel is basically light and a little thin as well. Drinkability isn't too poor, I could have a couple of these. Not a favorite but I'll take one if you give it to me."
"When you pour the beer into a pint glass, it shows maybe a ½ inch white head that dissipates quickly. There isnt any of that fancy lacing sticking around the sides of the glass like you get with thicker beers. It appears cloudy, and has a light yellow color. It smells like citrus, oranges, maybe coriander? It is a mild, slightly thinner beer, with the taste nicely mirroring the way it smells. Everyone drinks this with a slice or orange, and it isnt unlike the more common lemon/wheat beer combo. It just works. It is fruity, light, and often called a summer beer. Translate: chick beer."
"I like this beer well enough to drink it if its the only decent beer on tap. Gold, cloudy,and a white head it looks right but something is missing. Very heavy beer for the style and lightly spiced the main flavor seems to be orange. Overall I enjoyed it when I had it, but the only other choices were domestic lagers."
"T: A bit pedestrian when compared to the other great wits I've had in my life, but still good, would definitely have again if offered, one of the better ""psuedo-micros"" I've had from BMC."
"Not a great beer. The wife ended up drinking it."
"I'm a sucker for this beer, maybe because I'm a sucker for coriander. I prefer Sam Adams and Saranac as staple beers (Yuengling if I don't have a lot of money), but this is a nice diversion when I want something else. Pass on the orange slice unless you want to forget that this is actually a beer; there's plenty of orange taste already. It's also good straight from the bottle, but go ahead and pour it into your favorite glass if you have the chance."
"d-a favorite of mine!"
"One of my favorites. On tap at Beauregard's on University Blvd in Huntsville. Poured a nice cloudy orange color with a white head. Smell of orange and spices and a taste to match. Really smooth and velvety with just the right amount of carbonation. Very drinkable."
"This is one hell of a beer. It's unique taste of orange and coriander is really exquisite. I had first tried this beer on tap and immediately was hooked. It tastes great and has exceptional drinkability. Served with an orange peel, this just helps to bring out the distinct orange taste associated with this beer. This is definitely a great white beer - hands down, one of the best I've ever tried. If you are looking for something new and different, you should certainly try this. Great on tap or out of the bottle, and like most beers, best served really cold."
"I have never seen anything like this before. It kind of looks much like a light apple cider in appearance. Has a cloudy golden pulp that can be seen with plenty of carbonation. Has a nice silky head that stays awhile. This stuff smells good and has a hint of citrus like orange peal. Felt good in my mouth and very nice chilled on a warm day but I do not mind having it on hand at all times. This was my first try off the beaten path of the other usual suspects that got me to try new things. It will continue to be one of my favorites."
"the color is somewhat less to be desired, not really much character, but with a slice of orange (if your barkeep knows a thing or two) it can really hit the spot. if you get tired of heavy dark beers, this is one to really try for a weeknight out."
"I am comfortable with this beer and appreciate a mega brewer putting forth the effort"
"D - Not too bad I'd say, it goes down easily. I don't necessarily think this is a bad beer, it just isn't for me. If there happens to be nothing in my fridge but this, I'll throw one or two back, but I won't be looking for it in the mean time."
"Got a 22oz. glass filled with this cloudy, orangish liquid. No head retention what so ever and left no lacing. Does not look very appetizing. Almost like orange juice that has been left out for a couple of days. Not much aroma to speak of. The light bodied beer tastes of wheat and citrus. Poor carbonation doesn't help with the mouthfeel. Could definately be improved. A decent beer for the price and likely the only ""craft"" brew you will find on tap at a lot of bars."
"I have and will continue to drink this beer. A required (for me at least) summer drink."
"Something I wish was more available here. This would make a good ""less expensive"" beer to keep available."
"Drinkability: It's enjoyalbe...I'd enjoy another one. A lot like a hefe"
"It really surprised me to learn that Coors is behind the creation of this beer. Bravo, it's a respectible beer in its own right, and a good gateway for those looking for something a little more adventurous."
"Could drink a lot of these for how much alcohol it contains"
"D - A very average wit, I can take it or leave it. I am not sure if the pint I had was the freshest as I have had it and enjoyed it slightly better in the bottle. It sometimes is the best beer available where I live, so I don't avoid it. All in all a fairly average wit, okay for summer quaffing."
"It's a good beer; not stylistically accurate, but alright."
"D: I wouldn't want to let this get anywhere close to warm. No thank you on a second one."
"As I said, in a bottle, I was never very impressed with this, but if it is barely cold, it has nice flavor like that too."
"Edit: Now that I read respected BA members' reviews that aren't as harsh as mine...I doubt they were wrong; I suspect that the mass production (in Canada?) of this product has led to a deterioration of quality. I stand by my review."
"For the sometimes bad rap this beer gets around here, I find it unfair. It's not knock your socks off fantastic but neither is it crap."
"Generally not a terrible beer, although to be honest I started the review with higher numbers for appearance and drinkability: the head retention was bad and I decided that I really wouldn't care to have another Blue Moon unless I was quite thirsty, and just really wanted a drink. The mouthfeel is appropriate, a little thin but it is a wheat beer, a little too spicy, but that's a wit...nothing horribly out of line, many casual drinkers don't even realize it's from Golden, CO, and that's OK. Enjoy it if it's up your alley, but there are better Blanches, Wits, Weizens, and the like out there."
"I wouldn't want to pay a premium price, but I'd drink again."
"and I like the Blue Moon for the unique bouquet of taste and a great mouthfeel."
"An excellent beer. Pours smooth and goes down smooth. It's one of my favorites on a hot summer day. It's got an excellent color, very light. The head doesn't last long and the lacing isn't very strong, but it has a nice 'witbier' nose to it. The taste is excellent, though. It's one of the best brews I've had from a major brewer. It's also one of the few beers I occasionally ""fruit," as the infrequent lemon slice is a nice addition."
"d - i used to really like this beer, about 3 years ago, but i've since expanded my palate and this just doesn't cut it. it will do in a pinch and people will usually have this at a party or something like that. it's easily drinkable and coors could do a lot worse."
"Drinkability: I'm going to call this very drinkable. Unlike a lot of one and done micro's, this is something I could have a few of. Feels odd giving a macro such a high score, but being light on alcohol and passable in the flavor department apparently has its perks."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, good for hot summer days."
"a little on the sweet side for my tastes, but I got a case tonight and will finish it by the weekend. good beer but nothing amazing."
"Not on par with other Wits I've had, but decent enough on a nice day."
"Drinkability- This actually was a nice beer. Especially since I was outside cooking on the grill. For a Coors product I was impressed."
"This beer suprised me, Upon seeing it was a wheat beer, I was expecting the kind of smell and taste of a hefe-wiezen. But opening the bottle, there is a definate citrus smell that hits you. Upon the first taste, you definatly have the fruity/citrusy taste that isn't involved with a lot of wheat beers. Definatly a good beer, Available pretty much at every store. Recomended for somone who wants somthing more domestic, but not the bland budwieser,coors or miller taste."
"Somewhat cloudy in appearance and more closer to a hefeweizen color-wise than a witbier. Aroma has hints of wheat and spice and even coriander. Taste is somewhat interesting. It's pretty bitter and not quite what I expect in a witbier. Too much spice and maybe a bit too sweet. Just not very impressive."
"I look forward to trying this again to see if the second impression was as good as the first."
"Overall, this is a fine little blond lady. Id suggest it to anyone who wants to try an American attempt at witbier."
"This is a nice beer for the summer season. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I also like to swish the bottle to make sure I get all of the goodness in my glass."
"Pretty good beer. Kind of a poor mans Hoegaarden. Pours a cloudy golden color with decent head that it doesnt retain. Aroma is kind of weak. Flavor is a bit citrusy, but also tastes of spice. Mouthfeel is good and the amount of carbonation seems to be good. Probably the best Coors/Molson beer Ive had. Very drinkable."
"Pretty much available anywhere. Im pretty amazed that they pack 12 cases, because for a quality product, you dont usually see more than 6, but then again it is Coors Brewing Co. Attractive bottle and a cloudy, murky color with nice head. The smell is big on citrus and light on hops, and that will be very apparent and reaffirmed upon the first sip. Light, smooth ale with pretty strong citrus hints. Light, but leaves a pretty sticky taste in your mouth after a while. Overall, I could easily drink these all night. Compared to the other widely available beers, this beer is the king."
"That said, this is an OK beer. I don't like the appearance or the mouthfeel, but the taste is ok, and that's the most important part. A decent wheat beer taste, with a touch of lemon. Can't complain too much about that."
"D: The puckering finish cuts into the drinkability as well. Decent enough flavor, but I think I'd rather just drink lemonade."
"D- feels heavy due to the yeast content, yet light on the palate and relatively easy to consume. it's all the rage now in ohio, and it's a good witbier despite its coors lineage, but it has that macro taste, and i'd prefer a hoegaarden or hefeweizen to get my wheat fix any day."
"Great summer beer!"
"Pours a cloudy copper color with a decent head, retention, and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Very sweet smelling, with strong aromas of orange and coriander. Has a very sweet, citrusy flavor to it. Orange pool, coriander, and wheat flavors stand out. Medium body, not difficult to drink at all, especially with the nice, sweet flavor this beer has. Overall, a decent tasting beer, especially considering its produced by Coors. Definitely a good beer to get your friends that aren't into the craft-brew scene interested in it."
"The taste is light, with some spice, wheat, citrus fruit, and orange peel. Mouthfeel-wise, Blue Moon is very refreshing, but not much else. Medium-bodied, good carbonation, and no aftertaste despite the yeasty kick. Bottom line: not only is this a great beer to introduce others into the world of great beer, but (surprise, surprise!) it's a great beer, especially in the summer. Never will I turn a Blue Moon down."
"Medium body, not real drinkable, wouldn't want to session a beer like this."
"D: Good flavor, not too filling, refreshing on a summer eve on the deck."
"12 oz. bottle into a weizen glass... appropriately large weizen head on a sediment-rich brownish-orange body...citrus aroma with a slight grassiness...sourness and a bit of fizziness on the tongue...smooth, crisp, watery(?) with a slight malt aftertaste... a perfect summer brew and a good mainstream introduction to the unfiltered world of weizens... more complex beers are out there than this American attempt..."
"An inoffensive hot weather quaffer, but I'd go with Hoegarrden instead (and did during a sweltering hot picnic/party)."
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle. Cloudy orange/gold in appearance with good head that faded down to a permanent 1/8th inch. Hint of citrus and vanilla in the nose but very faint. I wish there were a little more here. The taste is muted. Can't really pin it down as it is ... I don't know. There really isn't much taste. It's not bad at all, it's just doesn't seem to want to offend. The mouthfeel is nice. A little carbonation up front that becomes creamy. Very drinkable if you want generic."
"This beer seems to be the American domestic of witbier, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. First of all this beer can be found in many different places and definitly trumps it's usual neighbors of coors light and bud light. In terms of being a witbier, Blue Moon comes off not as cloudy as others but maintains the classic spices and orange peel aroma and flavors that make up this style. It is somewhat cloudy with a tint of orange to it and a crisp head. This is not the feel of a traditional witbier on the tongue, but it does somehow retain a smoothness despite it lacking in body. It tastes of spices and orange peels followed by a malty finish. Some aspects of this beer really speak typical domestic, but for some reason this actually works for this beer since it retains some aspects of a white beer. Blue Moon is worth a try and has become my saving beer in many typical restraunts."
"Light,smooth,refreshing a slight tangyness. Had this beer on my draft system last summer when over big with a slice of orange in it. About the only beer I would add fruit to,it really helps this beer out."
"I respect beers like Blue Moon quite a bit because the have lead many to beer geekdom. Not bad, not great."
"Pours a cloudy, very light orange amber color with a head that holds a thin dusting over the liquid. Huge orange aroma, combined with sweet, honeyed malts and a bready note. The taste skews toward a creamy coriander note, along with some cloying sweetness from the malt and a just a bit of orange fruits at the end. Mouthfeel is thick and full, with very little of the citrus acidity that you'd expect from the style. Overall, this beer is OK. It's too sweet and some of the spices are overpowering, but it's not terribly gross or anything. Still, it's nothing compared to a lot of other wits out there."
""
"Overall, this is a fairly standard light witbier. Common and mass marketed, it's a great intro to the beer world, but nothing too excellent. Enjoyed it thoroughly though on an actual blue moon day!"
"I would give this beer another try without a doubt."
"After the second sip, I was dreading having to finish the bottle much less the other five bottles."
"As for Coors making a wit, this could be a lot worse. In Los Angeles, this can sometimes be the best beer available (and almost always served with a lemon wedge - dumb). At best it's refreshing and a poor man's Hoegaarden. At worst it tastes like Coors chemically made wit."
"Not great but solid."
"Poured from a bottle into a weitzen glass a nice clear amber with a large four-finger head that quickly turned to lace. Nice clean smell of citrus that reminds me of Earl Grey tea. Taste is the same... bergamot orange, herby, astringent. Nice clean finish with only a touch of the yeasty sourness I love in German weitzens. Overall a good beer, and probably the best American wheat beer I've had! These go down super easy and would make a great session beer."
"D-Blech. I tried to give this a chance, I really did. This is a terrible wit. The other three left over from the six will sit in my firdge until someone else comes over. This is like watered down sunkist with a ateaspoon of coriander put in."
"Refreshing and easy to kick back. It tastes okay and feels alright."
"D: Even though it is not my fav. style, I really enjoyed this brew and I was shocked it was a Coors product. This is one beer to have for dessert."
"Overall, I was rather impressed with this beer. Light, refreshing and flavorful, it would be a perfect drink for a warm summer day."
"Given this was the most interesting of the fairly mundane selection offered up at the time, I couldnt complain too much.... NOT!!"
"I hate Coors, so liking even one of their offshoots hurts me, but I have to say this one isn't bad. I've had this one a bunch of times but am just now getting to the review. It's usually the best available at most non-beer places. Pours a fairly opaque yellow with a white head that sits on there pretty nicely. Nose is mild, some melon sweetness as well as citrus. Taste is good, more of that fruitiness and very refreshing, nice amount of coriander as well. Feel is medium body with solid carbonation. Overall, a tasty beer that's a step above the rest of the crap at most places."
"this beer seems to be everywhere as the other micro brew (Even tho made by coors) next to sam adams at tgi fridays and stuff, but it is becoming one of my favorites and has made me start to love the witbier style. probably one of the easiest to drink beer's ive ever had, amazingly easy to drink alot of these in a row, especially with an orange, altho i dont think u really need one. a beer i could drink over and over but ive noticed its considerably better on draft then in bottles."
"Brewed by Molson Canada, appearance is a cloudy wheat in color with a crisp head that doesn't stick around too long. Smell is light with malts and citrus. Taste is citrusy (lemon), crisp but thin with a bit too much carbonation. Mouthfeel is light with decent amount of hops, but the carbonation makes it hard to go down and has a dry finish."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Although soft on its entry into the mouth, the beer quickly foams up and spreads itself wickedly into a frenzy. The result, though acceptable in this case, is reminiscent of a macro lager. The gassy aftermath could use some taming for a more enjoyable experience. For a Coors ""specialty"" style beer, I can see why this has stood the test of time for so long... it's quite tasty, and specific while also being widely available."
"On tap and poured into a pint glass, pours a hazy yellow with a bit of head that leaves no lace. Smell is of bitter honey and a bit of citrus as well maybe from the wheat. Taste is heavy on carbonation and a bit of bitter, this was so heavy carbonated it was hard for me to drink. It did go down smooth after I got a bit use to it. This would be pretty good on a hot summer day, not the greatest in the world though."
"This was my first experience with a witbier, and it has proven to have been a good place to start. This beer is widely available because it is brewed by Coors of Golden, Colorado. This is a very decent mass-production version of a Belgian white ale. I must say that although many bars now serve this pint topped with a citrus garnish, I much prefer it without."
"Poured a cloudy orange colour, and served with an orange slice on the rim. This was indicative of the flavour, but added a pulpy texture to the beer that was unusual. The head was slight and fast, with almost non-existant lacing. Very citrusy, both on the nose and the tongue. Overall a nice beer, representative of the style. I was very surprised to learn it was produced by a Coor's company."
"D - Not my favorite style, but good for a variety of light food pairings, especially vegetarian food."
"i too was suprised this was a coors product. pours a hazy orange wheaten. the head goes real fast. the nose is definitly orange with other citrus maybe slight clove. nice but tame. the same can be said for the taste. very nice for a BMC to put out. good flavor good price good availability. but there are better domestic versions of the style."
"overall, definatly one of the better beers i've had, especially for being made by coors."
"D: Good, especially for a widely available Coors product - that always surprises me."
"The smell is a little unappealing, too sweet. The flavor, however, was surprisingly complex with berries, orange, and corriander. It's not dumbed down like you'd expect in a macro beer of any type. The body is a touch thick for a witbeer, but this really isn't a bad beer at all."
"12 oz brown bottle brewed by Molson/Coors in Canada. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow straw color with a billowy white head that settles to leave just a little lacing. Nice citrusy aroma with a little sweet malt and a hint of peppery coriander. Tastes of yeasty sweet malt with a little orange and coriander. Smooth and balanced. Because this is made by Coors it automatically gets a bad rap by some. Are there better witbiers out there? Sure, but not a widely available as this one. Good call on a hot summer day."
"Tried this beer once before on a suggestion. I was told to try it with an orange. I wasn't overly impressed. I tried it after my buddy told me that it is better without the orange. It was better without the orange. It is a refreshing beer and easy to drink. I could drink several of these especially on a nice hot day. I would order something else before this if there wasn't much of a selection at the bar."
"This has been my standard for introducing people to Belgian-style witbiers. I can't believe it's made by Coors! (That's what I get for not reading the label closely.) Anyway, it makes sense, since it's now on tap everywhere, and it tastes a hell of a lot better than the other macros out there. I think they did a decent job honoring the style and creating something that most people would enjoy."
"This is very easy to drink. A good [beginning] introduction to a Belgian style white ale [wit bier]. I cant believe this product is made by Coors. Thanks to Dad for this tasting!!"
"This is certainly not the greatest of wheat / 'belgian-sytle white' beers you'll find, but an impressive attempt nonetheless, given its' macro-nature (you see this thing on tap EVERYWHERE now, even in Nashville!). If you order this at a bar, make sure to ask for it WITHOUT THE ORANGE - you do not need it."
"As typical of North Americans, Blue Moon suggest you garnish it with an orange slice. I avoided that temptation, and does one really need to? The flavor was complex enough to keep me going. Maybe they want us to flavor their beer so it tastes like Tang. Weird."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light hazy straw, forming a large white head, and leaving light rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is light citrus along with a medium yeast aroma. The taste is a light citrusy flavor, followed by a nice yeast thickness, and ending with a light grain. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, this beer really suprised me. I assumed that a Coors product couldnt be that great, but I was wrong. Its not the best witbier, but its also not the worst. Give it a try!"
"Left over after a party the other night, I figured I should review this beer while I have the chance. Appearance is pretty much spot on, cloudy gold with a nice frothy head. The aroma is a dry and almost vegetal, maybe some corriander or other spices. Flavor is at first slightly sharp with a cough drop like herbal flavor. Some spices are evident, as well as a light yeasty flavor. This is definitely a good start for the non beer drinker and a great alternative to macrolagers and malternatives for that crowd."
"D: This is a very easy beer to drink because of its sweet/citrus flavors."
"Pours a very cloudy orange pineapple color with a fluffy head that recedes quickly, but clings a bit to the glass. Really faint, clean wheat nose with only background spicing. No real yeast character stands out. Flavor is similar to the aromas. No real yeast character to speak of. Just a wheaty body with orange and coriander in the finish. Light bodied, mildly carbonated. Decent drinker all-around, but not such a great witbier."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, its not a bad beer and its a heck of a lot better on-tap that it is from the bottle. Although I would drink this over a regular macro, it definitely wouldnt be something I would go with if I had my mind set on drinking a Witbier."
"Very cloudy golden orage color in pint glass. Smell is severe orange. Taste is severe orange. Really doesn't taste like a wheat beer. The orange flavor is over the top. Still more interesting than other macros, so if it's the best thing on draft, I will get it sometimes. Very drinkable. Doesn't get nasty as it warms up."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Can be a good introduction to unfiltered beers or witbier, or a good choice if macros are the only things available."
"D: Overall a good ber one that i wouldn't shy away from"
"I tried this beer at a chain restaurant in a large weizen type glass. I was cloudy orange-gold in color, with decent head. It smelled of orange and citrus. It was very sweet, too sweet, with orange fruit flavors. It was very gassy, too much even for the style. I would seek out other white beers to drink regularly."
"I have been hearing a great deal of this beer, especially right after Hoegarden is mentioned. Since I enjoy Hoeegarden as a session beer (recently have seen it everywhere), I decided I would try this beer. Call me the ultimate snob, but I was put off when I saw it was a screwcap. It had an umimpressive head and the taste was less impressive than Hoegarden. Not a great beer."
"Served chilled, poured a pale yellow color, with a big frothy white head. Actually had pretty good head stability and left a thin line of lace on my glass. Smell was grainy, but with some yeast and spice. There was an aroma of citrus (more orange than lemon) and the accompanying orange slice helped rather than hindered. The taste was quite clean and refreshing. There was a bit of fruit plus some spiciness in the finish. Lots of carbonation (almost too much) gave it a foamy mouthfeel rather than the crisp clean finish in other wit beers. A decent effort, and a good cross over beer for someone new to the style. Better than expected."
"Blue Moon looked promising in the glass, but looks are deceiving. It lacked body, even for a witbier. There are much better wheat beers out there."
"It pours out a yellowish-orange color, very cloudy and with a thin foamy head. Often times it's served with an orange slice to bring out the flavor. It mainly smells of hops and yeast, but the taste is more complex - hops, but also some mild citrus flavors. I always found it refreshing and delicious."
"That being said-this beer isn't a solid example of a Belgian White. I get annoyed when I am enjoying witbier and the bartender comments that it is similar to blue moon. It is highly overcarbonated and doesn't have the typical light taste of a witbier."
"Goes great with the Peel-N-Eat Shrimp from American Tap Room."
"Poured into my tulip glass (why not) with a hazy yellowy/orange like color. A respectable foamy white head lingered a bit, adding to the nose. Of course the fact that it was aggressively swirled in a large tulip helped matters I'm sure. The nose had a nice sweet, malty, vanilla aroma, as crisp hoppy traces finish it off. The taste translated fairly well from the nose, with more pronounced hops and faint notes of wheat and orange zest (I not a user of the orange slice, by the way, but many find it tasty). The light mouth feel makes this a terrific tailgate or BBQ beer, pairing well with all the grilled beasts, side dishes, chips, dips & accoutrements that cross it's $7.99 or so a six pack path...Enjoy"
"Well here we have a macro trying out the Belgian flavors. Good intentions I have to admit. If we could get more people tuned Belgians, left would be much nicer. Poured a very pale amber with a big frothy white head, which hung around for a couple minutes, just long enough to leave a little bit of lace on the glass. Visible carbonation inside made this look lively and not bad at all. Smell was light, but did have some sublte fragrences that suprised me a bit. Of course there was a large amount of bread and grain smells to get through, but once you do there are some hints at fruitness. Maybe some plum, dark fruits definate here, and some spice. Not at all bad, could be stronger, and the huge amount of malt to get through to find it made it hard. The taste was very clean. Light smooth mouthfeel, and generous carbonation made it feel fine going down. Taste was a bit different. Hints of spices and a tiny bit of fruit trying to fight against the grain here. Low ABV and light feel made this highly drinkable. Overall this was not as bad as I thought, but then again not as good as it could have been. If they keep experimenting they may be onto something, I just hope I dont see BUD DIPA!"
"Not the greatest, but not the worst."
"Recommended, but youll find better examples of the style before too long"
"D - not bad, refreshing even, but i wouldn't have it again."
"drinkability - Refreshing beer not bad at all. Nice summer beer. Have had on tap and in bottle, many times. Made by Coors, did you know that? They should put Coors right over the Blue Moon label lol."
"Overall a good refreshing beer to have, and a decent alternative to the other macro brews."
"This brew pours a nice cloudy yellowish orange color with a nice thick white head although it doesnt last too long. Aroma is of a little fruity yeast and lemon peel. Taste is decent with a nice light wheat flavor and a little more lemony citrus; nothing offensive, just nothing strong. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, creamy almost, and pleasantly carbonated. This is a pretty easy drinker that is available almost everywhere. Definitley a decent brew, and a very good crossover beer, even if someone goes with the citrus slice. Overall a decent beer that I am not sure gets a fair shake because its Coors, and there are far worse options generally where this beer is available."
"Got a large draft at Ruby Tuesday. Was shocked slightly when the waitress brought the beer to me. Not cloudy at all, very clear, straw color, almost looked like a BMC. Very minumal head. Not much smell at all, or nothing that would define a witbier. The first sip made me think I was drinking a BMC but it was smoother. Not much of the typical orange or spice that I'm used to with the Hoegaarden, which is the only other witbier I've had. Overall, this is not a bad beer, one I could see myself drinking a few of but it's nothing spectacular."
"D - it went down pretty easy."
"At first, this beer strikes me as quite sweet and has a very clean finish. This may seem odd, but the smell kinda reminds me of cheese for whatever reason, mixed with the smell of a very sweet drink of some sort. This beer is different. It kinda like someone took a Sam Adams Boston Lager and poured sweet tea into it. As odd as all that may sound, I find it to be quite good and something I would enjoy to drink more of. Very smooth and pretty damn tasty. Cheers."
"Overall, Blue Moon is a great beer to have around. I'd choose many other witbiers over it, but if it's a Blue Moon or Bud Light decision... I think you'll know which way I'm leaning."
"A refreshing, easy drinking wheat beer. Tartness dominates a bit as continue to drink, and really lacks the distinct flavors of a fine example."
"This is one of my favorite beers. It pours a rich amber color, and the sediments in the bottom of the bottle help proclaim that the beer is unfiltered. The head is pretty decent, though going away fairly quickly, and the nose is that of a great hefeweizen. The beer is brewed with orange peel, and you can tell when drinking it. No added citrus is really needed, but it can be good. It goes down smooth, and is definitely a beer you will want to hold in your mouth for a while."
"Try it with an orange."
"Haven't had this in a while and thought I'd try it again. Pours a cloudy amber, with a quickly reducing head. Faint smell of grass and Belgian yeast. It's not fair to compare to a different style but I was expecting more of a hefe type body. Faint taste of banana and clove with a dry finish. Great for a Coors product, just ok since we've been able to get good beer in North Carolina."
"If you like this style, try it, but keep in mind, it is from Golden, CO, so it's a macro in micro disguise."
"Cloudy orange color with an average appearing white head. Fruity aroma. Taste is a good representation of the style. Not terribly complex, but aspects of citrus, coriander and pepper. clean aftertaste; this goes down extremely easily. A nice choice when there is nothing else but macro's on tap."
"The head was 2 inches high and lasted 2 seconds. It has a nice cloudy golden color, and a fruity aroma. The initial taste had the same hint of fruitiness that soon was replaced by the taste of wheat, although neither overpowered the other. The first few sips had no aftertaste whatsoever, but as I kept drinking each sip had a stronger and stronger wheaty aftertaste. By the end I wanted the citrus elements to come back, but I guess the only way I could get that is to crack open another one, which is just fine, since it was not at all heavy. Overall its a great wheat beer which works well both in the wintertime or during a warmer weather day, which to me is always a plus."
"Not a bad-tasting beer, and definitely will be one of the better tap offerings at a suburban chain restaurant, but I'm never going for one of these if there's a Celis White, an Allagash or a Hoegaarden in the room."
"Poured from a bottle into a mug. Got a decent head from a hard pour, though it doesn't retain all that well. The lacing is moderate; it eventually dissipates within 5-10 minutes. Orangish yellow opaque color (especially opaque only when the yeast on the bottom of the bottle is added). A lemony smell dominates the beer along with a faint hint of wheat. The taste is fairly good: first some mild hops, then the orange peel and coriander (with the orange peel definitely dominating!) and then some malty-yeasty sweetness before the orange peel and hops come back again. Good taste (for a Coors product especially!). The mouthfeel is decent, nice carbonation and light bodied. Altogether a fairly decent beer (which comes as a surprise since it is a Coors product!) Definitely worth a try!"
"Poured into glass mug, had a cloudy orange appearance with a creamy head. Hints of orange and corriander were present, crisp finish with yeasty undertones. A pretty good beer, but I wouldnt say its super great, it is a quality good beer though, a tad expensive though. All in all it was good, i recommend it, but I won't be buying it all the time. A nice change from the molson/labbat."
"D - Pretty good. A lot of people love this beer and I see why. It is mild and refreshing, not a lot of character, but what it does have isn't bad at all."
"Also, try other beers actually from Belgium so you can see what they are trying to emulate. Then you may see why I do not like this beer much."
"I first tried this several years ago and I was sitting there wondering if it were a real Belgian when John at Horace & Sylvias told me Coors brewed this! This is now trendy and wildy popular among my macro loving friends. That alone made me more wary of this brew. It pours a cloudy yellow color with an enormous head that fizzles down to a white ring. The aromas are very light but whats barely there is typical of Belgian Wits. Light spice, clove, anise, and some citrus in here. The taste really isnt bad and I think its drinkabilty is fairly high. But its definitely not great when compared to other Witbiers. Overall its a decent offering but not something I seek out. I do want to try their pumpkin and winter ales, which I've heard are much better."
"Drinkability: Nice and easy to drink. Maybe a little too strongly spiced with respect to most wits, but a good try nevertheless."
"This beer is moderately drinkable. I don't think three or four would be a problem but it might get boring or ""bleh"" flavored. I definately prefer it over 95% of the other beers on the shelf though. Makes a great light beer for the winter with a semi high abv of 5.4%. I like the spice and wheat combination against the tart wit yeast."
"Finally tried this beer that a couple of my aquaintances order regularly. Not again. Unique, cloudy, glowing hue (maybe not unique...I'm not sure, this is my first witbier) which begins promising, does not ultimately deliver. Very sweet, orange-juice sort of flavored malt; just a little flat with a hard-to-put-my-finger-on-it taste I ultimately pegged as piña colada. Full mouthfeel (though still flat) makes way for a gentle rise of vapors at the finish I would expect more after downing a shot of liquor. Kind of a *blech* finish to it all. I really didn't enjoy this beer all that much at all."
"A nice, orange gold color with a decent white head with good retention. A malty, bitter smell. A malty taste with a citrus aftertaste associated with a witbier. An ok mouthfeel although I was hoping for slightly thicker. Pretty good, drinkable beer; good if you are in the mood for a sweeter beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Cheap, easy to find (I picked up a sixer of this at a gas station on the way to my buddy's house after work), mellow, and smooth."
"Many people/bartenders serve the beer with an orange slice. Hold up your hand and declare: ""no fruit!"". Forget the fruit, unless you are into that kind of thing. Eeeww-yuch. Good beer does not need fruit and such things floating around in it. Just a good head in a nice glass and some great friends make this a very good beer."
"Everytime I drink this beer it tastes a little better. I originally scored this very poorly, then the next day, I gave it another try and raised it a notch. Now, months later, it's not bad and i'll even order it occassionally, the wheat beers are growing on me some...."
"I got this on tape at a Gino's East Pizza. It poured a cloudy orange yellow, with a nice white head. It had a malty citrus smell to it, and a nice matching taste. It wasn't what I expected from a Coor's product, or from a wheat bear. The bartended put a slice of orange in it, and it augmented the citrus flavor. There was good carbonation, and was quite drinkable. I might get a 6 to try with a friend, and I would order it on tap again."
"Pours a cloudy dark lemon with a substantial head, minimal lacing. Eighth inch head remains throughout. Smell is malt, slightly grassy. Taste is not as wheaty as I expected...some fruit notes...a tad hint of metallic notes and medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is creamy. Drinkability is ok...metal and medicinal notes are distracting."
"Basically Coor's attempt into the craft world. This beer isn't too bad, but it seems to lack a little bit. Try it, but don't expect too much."
"I fiirst sampled this at the Coors Brewery in Golden and I continue to pick up some from time to time. This is a good choice for a casual evening of drinking."
"This is just a nice and simple beer. It's quite drinkable, and doesn't try to do to much. A good warm weather diversion, and probably the best beer from a ""macro"" brewery I've had."
"This is very easy to drink, and for something made by Coor's, it's even better. Recommended."
" Big white foamy head that just wants to stick around awhile.Looks a very cloudy golden color that has lots of particles floating about. Not much smell maybe a bit of fruit. Tastes thick and creamy with a bite of orange. A good easy drinking beer over all with lite flavors."
"This beer is still on the fence. Great taste!!!Mild and a bit uneventful but very clean and acceptable for a masspro witbier... Aftertaste bitter. a bit heavy when warmer...a bit thin when very cold.... Pumpkin, orange, coriander taste. good carbonation ...slightly overdone. Nice frothy head that lasts about 2minutes. One of the best Macro produced beers that you can buy..the alcohol finish is almost vodkaish...kinda that warm mint with a hint of lemon citrus zest aftertaste...overall: good not great. This is a good take on the genre from Coor's. They've actually done a better job with this style than many micro's I've tried...rather had a schneider hefe but I can get this at the local grocer for 14.99 a twelve.... and the bottle design is very nice.... Great with a veggie pizza..i can attest. taste 7 drinkability 5 smell 4...out of ten. Unfairly labeled a woos beer. one of the best sub 8$ sixers at the grocery... especially if you don't count sam adam's. This beer is often bashed unfairly...you could do worse...say hummer...or widmer. As for adding orange...again...the only beer that is truly improved by fruit is corona...and that's because a corona is water...who doesn't want some lemon or lime in their water? I was sitting at a decent but underfunded microbrewery in Cbus(since shut down) when the first cases of this were rolled in....that seems like ages ago now...I'd say around 1995..96? The distributor was on his last stop and donated the last case on his truck(on his first shipment of the prod.) to our evening...I found it to be a decent mass produced representation of the style....and still do today. I'd say that today it seems a bit more carbonated and thinner but then again my palate isn't the same either."
"A very easy drinking witbier, I particularly enjoy this beer. It's good for year round consuption."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is an opaque murky yellow with active carbonation fueling a thin finger of fizzy bright white head that quickly fell back to a light white ring of lacing. Smell is yeasty, grain, mostly wheat, malt and spicy coriander notes. Light lemony aromas also present. Taste is also yeasty and spicy, malty finish to a slightly dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, goes down smooth and easy. Drinkability is excellent, lower abv with a somewhat plain flavor and character is very refreshing. This beer is easily one of my favorites from the Coors company, and although gets a bit of a bad reputation for being a macro, this beer still has enjoyable attributes and is readily affordable and available most anywhere. Not outstanding, but still worth a try, nice introduction into Witbiers."
"This is an opaque, banana color with a thin white head. Smells and taste very solid, but just super average and middle of the road for wit. I'm sure some folks would gasp to hear this, but I kind of consider this a benchmark of the style. All the elements are there, but subtley presented and very balanced. Its just really no-nonsense wit. I love Hoegaarden much as the next guy, but sometimes them flavors be wildin'."
"I poured this 12 ounce bottle into a glass beer mug. It is a very hazy straw, extra pale. It has a small head that quickly fades. You can both smell and taste the wheat in the beer, very light with little to no hoppy flavor. This is a good change of pace beer. I did not drink it with the case recommended orange slice. I might next time."
"Overall, the drinkability is above average. I will have this again but I probably won't keep a lot on hand in my fridge."
"This beer poured a nice cloudy orange colour. It's lace lingered on the glass for about 2 minutes. It smells of a distinct orange peel and various spices which is a plus to me. It's taste revealed a very hop and malty side but a nice orange spice tast as well. Although to expsensive for me and not being my favorite but I strongly recommend this beer to people who like wheat ale a very nice drink indeed."
"D-very easy to drink.this is one of my favorite beers.this is the beer that got me into becoming a conisuer.really surprised to find out it was made by coors."
"Drinkability: All I have to say its Of course! I will have another. Drinking this beer as cold as you can get it and on a nice hot day, will surely give you satisfaction."
"Not the best of brews here."
"Drinks pretty easy, doesn't say Belgium, but not bad & better than some higher browed efforts I've seen"
"Also mixes nicely as a black and tan....or black and blue"
"Not bad. I would say this is the ""new Guinness""- in a sense that the most people now a days make their jump out of Miller Light or Bud with this beer. Not sure if I'm a fan of the orange gimmic. A good Witbier shouldn't need a piece of fruit. I will admit though that the orange does increase the flavor of this beer. But what does that say about the beer then? This beer just kind of makes me shrug my shoulders and say ""enh""."
"12 oz. bottle. Freshness code on bottle states Dec 24 028 27 N 06 A. Ok then. Pours a hazy straw golden color. Thick foamy white head disappears immediately. Some citrusy and spicy aromas. A bit grainy. Tart, with some lemon zest, along with some spices. There seems to be some artificial sweetness to this. Grainy, and a bit harsh. Good body, the carbonation is not overwhelming. I still think this is a bit harsh, but could be a decent gateway beer."
"Having had this previously bottled and having found it respectable opted to have this in a new establishment since it was on tap. Of course requesting a ""large", had it served in a huge weizen glass. Could have done without the orange section garnish, but still found it refreshing and very drinkable. So much in fact, it's been the only brew I drink when returning there."
"Not as good as a Hoegaarden, but for a beer from a company like Coors, it is very good."
"If you put aside any prejudices regarding this being brewed by Coors, it is a decent example of the style. Not quite up there with others such as Hoegaarden in my opinion, but not bad."
"Drinkability: Very high. This is a beer that's fairly refreshing and due to it's more watery character can be drunk pretty frequently or in a session. Due to the lack of concentration of flavor, it's really easy to drink a lot of this in searching for more taste."
"Overall a VERY drinkable wit. I was very pleasantly suprised and will definitely reach for this one again."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"It looked to be a cloudy golden color when poured . The scent was of citrus and hops . The head was off white and evaporated rather quickly . The taste was a strong but rather nice citrus,that mixed in well with the coriander and other spices The mouthfeel it was a lil bit wet and wattery but nothing that would keep me from coming back for more. Overall I rather like this beer and would recomend it to anyone."
"D: It's easy to put a few of these back, sure. It's not my favorite wit, but it's inoffensive, refreshing, and easily available. Plus, my wife likes these, so we usually have some around."
"Okay, I bought this one on a capitalist principle. I heard recently that MolsonCoors numbers were up in general, and in double digits with this particular beer. The macros should be more adventurous... Smells sweet and citrusy. Uniformly murky orange-yellow body with initially thick but fairly quickly dissipating white head. Tastes sweet and citrusy. Some hints of vanilla or something like it. Pleasant, but rather one-dimensional. About what I expected. If Im looking for a real Belgian white, Ill go with the Allagash version made right here in Maine. Nonetheless it beats the heck out of most macro offerings."
"Hats off to Coors for producing a beer that is not ""run of the mill American Macro lager."" This is a decent beer that I will buy again."
"You can definatly tell this is a wheat beer when you taste it. It is mellow and zingy at the same time. Good for drinking with your fish fry or chicken dish."
"D: Not highly drinkable, but a good starter beer for someone looking to get into craft even though its brewed by the giant Coors. Could be a good summers drink if you had to."
"Since this is one of the few good brews at my local wings restaurant, I'll be having this one again."
"Drinkability - A pretty decent drinking beer if it is a hot summer day and you need your thirst quenched. Otherwise, I wouldn't be ordering this too often. However, it is a better choice than most macros."
"Pours a hazy golden, with moderate head. Sweet citrus smell overlapped by spicy hints of corriander and allspice. Smooth drinking, with moderate carbonation. Light in flavor with citrus notes, coupled with spicy undertones. Very little trace of bitterness, drink is dominated by wheat sweetness. Goes down super smooth; great on a summer evening listening to oldies. Good summer brew!!"
" This one is very easy to drink. I always keep Blue Moon in the fridge at home. All of my BMC drinking friends actually enjoy this one and some have actually started trying Hefes and other styles."
"Blue Moon Belgian White is certainly no substitute for any of the worlds premier Belgian ales but it still offers a good taste that beats most mass- market products and it is sold for a relatively low price. It is widely available, too, making it a good beer to offer to someone who is new to the world of craft brew."
"Hard to believe this is from Coors (Molson, whoever) Pours a hazy orange color, smells sweet in a way almost sugary. Tastes better though, sweet orange, banana, a little bit yogurty too but not too much and it balances out well. Better mouthfeel than most macros. Overall this is pretty good. In some ways it seems a little too much not like a beer but it is really nice to drink anyway. Worth checking out."
"D: It's not bad, but I didn't finish it."
"It was mainly watery with a hint of refreshing creaminess. It's nothing special, a bit weak, pretty easy to drink and not bad. Nothing special, either."
"A pretty decent Witbier. Definetly the best that Coors has to offer. Had with a lice of orange that really brings out the citrus small and aroma, or it could have just been the orange. Cloudy color with a decent white head. Mouthfeel was pretty good however i really dont think i could sit and drink a bunch of these in a row, just doesnt have that ability."
"This was poured from a 12 oz. bottle. It was a deep straw/golden color. The head was small, even though I poured it vigorously. The head dissipated quickly. The smell is a slight bit skunky. This taste is a bit on the bland side with a little bit of a bite at the end. The mouthfeel is clean and a little watery. I'd consider this a drinkable beer and perhaps refreshing if served extra cold on a hot day."
"Eric"
"Overall, a mediocre beer. It looks ok and smells so-so, but the taste is just worthless. Hardly a Belgian white ale, when it comes to smell, taste, and mouthfeel. It has none of the subtlety, spicyness, or feel. Yet somehow it's very popular. Stay away, and get a Hoegaarden instead."
"Perhaps Sam Adams will fix their Witbier recipe and put it in regular distribution?"
"CRUX: DISAPPOINTING. Maybe it's better on-tap?"
"This beer pours cloudy without a lot of head retention. It smells very nicely when you drink it, the smell complements the flavor. Taste is very nice and sweet, but lacks some complexity. Mouthfeel is light but very fulfilling. I could drink one after the other. Very nice and sweet when you feel like having a sweet beer."
"I know, I know...it's a coors product. But the beer is pretty good. Are there better wits? Of course, but on a hot day this beer holds up well. Fruity and wheaty with no hops really detected. Sweet and slightly malty, with the only bad part, over carbonated. That being said, it looks pretty average is thin in the body, but so are most wits and it is extremely tasty and drinkable."
"I first had this Beer on tap at one of those restaraunts that requires the wait staff to wear pieces of ""flare"" and later bought a six pack to try it again. The appearance is cloudy gold with a white head that is completely gone is short order. It smells, as expected, of citrus zest and wheat. The taste is sweet citrus and subdued wheat with no hoppiness to speak of. It is thin in body, but finishes crisp and refreshing. I think this beer catches a lot of negativity because it is a Coors product. However, I found it to be very drinkable and it serves it's purpose for what it is - A clean quenching Summer Beer."
"Poured to a nice golden color, hazy as expected. Unfortunately, the faomy white head dissipated alomost immediately. This was very light, with a hint of fruit, but no aroma that I could detect. My wife would probably enjoy this, especially ion a warm summer night, but I want more beer taste."
"I had this beer at a local restaurant (because there was nothing else). I was pleased with my choice. It was served very cold the waitress said 36F. It poured and looked like what I would expect from a wheat beer. Cloudy and a pale golden color. The scent was that of citrus and hops nothing that just blew my world. The small off white head ( about 1/2"") was completely gone in less than 10 seconds. The taste was consistant with the style I felt that the strong citrus taste on the first sip was a bit much but it was more subdued on the following sips. The mouthfeel it was a very watery but smooth not bad but nothing special. I would drink this beer again. It went very well with the pasta I had last night and I think it would be very good on a hot summer day."
"This is a good fallback beer and cheaper than most wheat beers. Go for this one if only BMC is available and you'll be happy."
"The best before date on this one is Oct 06. Looked just like another pale wheat beer. It has a bland wheat flavour without being creamy, and a putrid yeast taste. Slightly dryer than the average wheat beer. The mouthfeel was alright. In general, the quality of this beer is not up to the average Belgian wheat beer."
"Finnish taste is definitely that of a wheat beer. This would not be my top pick in a good pub, but it is not a bad back pocket beer when the picks are limited."
"Looks like you're pouring straw into the glass. Didn't notice much of a scent on this one. There was a wheaty flavor and slight fruitiness, but nothing distinguishable. Fairly light in the mouthfeel department. Pretty drinkable for its lightness, but not a beer I'll be ordering again unless all the other choices are worse."
"This is a questionable beer, I understand how it can be a crossover beer for some, but outside of that, I don't think it's as good as most other brews. Pours out to a cloudy yellow gold color with a large head of white foam that remained consistant. Aroma of wet cardboard and hints of citrus and wheat. Taste is acceptable, yet devoid of any truely enjoyable quality; mild maltiness and grain, mixed with artificial citrus flavors make for a fairly interesting experience, yet not an overly joyful affair. Mouthfeel is slightly bubbly, but ultimately average. Drinkablilty is fair. I don't think i'll be back for more"
"Not a great example of the style. But, not a bad beer in it's own right. Good thirst quencher and quite smooth. Average all around, and the best Coors brewing has to offer."
"Can't remember the details since this was not memorable in a favorable way. What does stick in my head was that it smelled like cheap perfume, and tasted like I would imagine cheap perfume would taste. I do recall that I could not / would not finish the one bottle I tried, something that I have never had the displeasure of experiencing with any other beer. The remainder of the six pack my sister purchased is still in my parents' fridge, and there it will remain until they pour it out on the parched turf here in GA, where there is a watering restriction. I figure the grass will drink anything about now."
"Had this beer on tap, poured into standard pint glass. The beer is a cloudy light yellow. The head is white, but fades fast and leaves no sign of lace. Thin mouthfeel. Fruity but bland, slight pineapple, orange, lemon flavors, no hop presence, no malt presence. From what I have gathered this beer is made by Coors and marketed as a microbrew, but has a lot to be desired, not worth another pint."
"Drinkability: Interesting brew, not horrible, not what I expected. It almost seems like an apricot ale attempt. Not very spicy or herbal or wheaty. I can see this being good with some fruit cocktails or something light."
"Had on-tap at Miller's Ale House in Orlando. Unfiltered cloudy orange colored with citrus peel, slight coriander and yeast in the nose. Taste is smooth and come across very sweet. Citrus peel and coriander dominate the taste but I can not get past the sweetness of this brew. Overall not a very good representation of a belgian witbier."
"Mouthfeel is nice and full. Drinkability is serviceable. I could have a couple of these without trouble. This is a beer I generally buy due to its popularity with my friends - they love that I'll buy their favorite beer for them. What they may not realize is that it is lower cost than my favorite. ;-)"
"Light and refreshing, but then, so is Corona. I could session this one if I had to, but there's much better choices out there, especially for witbiers. After I finish the 6-pack, I doubt I'll ever buy this one again."
"This is a very drinkable beer, fairly light and smooth, with a crisp thirst quenching character about it. I would certainly drink Blue Moon again, although I dont know that I would search for it."
"Perfect for a hot summer night, just like tonight."
"A good choice if it's after 9 p.m. and the liquor store has already closed, especially if you want a change of pace from Shiner and Choc beer."
"The beer is easily drinkable, probably it's best asset. There are lots of alternatives that I would choose over this, but you do get some bang for your buck with blue moon, as it's usually pretty cheap."
"Not sure what to make of this one. It was probably over 10 years since I last had it in a bottle, but I remember I did like it though it was not a favorite. I also had some on tap in the last 6 months and thought it was pretty good. Bad bottle? Taste buds just not in synch with this beer tonight? Will have to re-review it later on to see what's up."
"Orangey yellow, and cloudy (real yeast in macro beer!) with a thin, creamy, quickly disipating head that leaves a white scum coating the surface. Smells much like a true witbier, but I detect a sourish off note in the background, hmm. Taste is solid, full, definitely wheat. Not excessively sweet as some wheat beers. There are detectable, husky pale barley malt notes behind the wheat. The finish does taste somewhat macro-lager-like. Mind you, this is a Coors product. The carbonation is a bit high but still good overall. Mouthfeel is noticably light for a wheat beer. Drinkability is where this beer shines, considering it's a coors product, it's macro, and it's low price point. This is the best beer for non craft-beer drinkers to be drinking, and I can down two of these in the time it takes me to get through a bud, miller, etc. It's no competition against good craft beer, but it's head and tails above other american macrobrews. I tend to think there is hope for people who I see drinking this. Not as complex as SA White, but this will do from time to time (albeit infrequently) whenever my stock of it runs out, until next season."
"I do have trouble getting past the pecular smell, however, and am trying to not sniff with each sip I take. This one would be much improved drinking straight from the bottle"
"I've had this before a while ago but I didn't remember anything about it. I tried it again last night. The first thing I noticed about this beer was the smell. It wasn't skunky, but it was not a pleasant smell whatsoever. Maybe I'm just weird. It tasted okay. It was a bit cirtusy in that orange-like sense, but not in a great way. Kind of like Flinstone Kids vitamins. I did finish okay, so that's a plus. I don't think I'd get this again, unless my only option was like Beast or something. But I gotta give Coors props for trying though."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink - I now see why the beer is so popular - it makes the drinker appear a bit edgy without taking any risk whatsoever that an offensive flavor might pass across the drinker's lips"
"Drinkability: It's just too weird to session."
"I poured and drank this hefe weizen from the bottle into a weizen glass where it produced a straw/orange, slightly opaque appearance with a medium/large head characteristic of hefe weizens. Being a purest, I initially refused to allow an orange slice to be placed in it, but my friend insisted. The aroma smelled of wheat malt and fruity esters as well as the citrus smell of the orange. The taste was typical of an average weizen that utilized higher fermenting temperatures to produce fruity esters and this was accented further by the orange presence. The taste was refreshing and fruity, but I felt that it was a bit too much for a beer. Admittedly, I haven't tried this without the orange, but I assume it to be fairly average. I did notice a minute amount of clove esters present. The mouthfeel was medium with a medium carbonation. The drinkability was average. While this beer didn't stand out to me as being extraordinary, I still believe it is worth a try and would certainly drink it if offered. A respectable witbier."
"A fairly mild rendition of the style with the signature coriander and citric characters playing minor roles in the composition of this ale. That being said I have found this is a wonderful starting point for expanding the world of the light beer drinker. Granted, Blue Moon is brewed by Coors, but it is a great starting point for moving on to some other Wits, such as Wittekerke, Allagash White or Bells Winter White to name a few of my favorites."
"As a wine drinker I'm well aware that the type and quality of glass actually does affect taste (mainly odor which hugely affects ""taste",) so this shouldn't surprise me. But from the bottle the heavy floral taste is minimized, subdued, which makes the beer much more enjoyable. To me."
"Blue Moon Belgian White pours a hazy golden color with a one inch white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Sweet citrus aroma and a touch of coriander are present in the smell. Definitely a dumbed down version of Wit in taste, but nothing unpleasant. Like a beginners version. Some citrus is definitely noticeable, coriander is fairly minor but present. Not bad, worth a try, and as many have already noted on this site, a good beginner beer to wean people off macro lagers."
"A very smooth, tasty brew good for a hot day. Not the most complex Wit you'll find, but maybe the most easy-drinking."
"D- goes down smooth"
"Added comments: I first had this on-tap at a Flying Saucer in my city. Since then, I've purchased several six-packs from a local Total Wine and More establishment. I have seen these six-packs even in grocery stores (Piggly Wiggly, Publix, etc.) so the Coors guys have done a very good job in not only making a good Belgian, but also making it available to the ""common man"". To those ends, this has become my ""summer beer"". It is refreshing while at the same time having a bit of body to it, rather than a quick and dirty common brew."
"D - Pretty drinkable and refreshing. Decent stab at a Belgian White."
"Notes: From the Coors people, this is a great beer. I have heavily surprised like the Bro's said that it is from a micro-brewery such as that."
"Milky, light orange with a small, white, tight, quickly diminishing head. The smell is of mild wheat with moderate-heavy citrus. Orange, lemon and strawberry and some light coriander and yeast. More of the same in the taste, except its a little more malty and sweet with more coriander. Its not thin in the mouth but it tastes a little thin. Nothing great, but very refreshing and fairly enjoyable. Goes well with seafood."
"Appearance is cloudy & orange. Served with an orange slice on the rim of the glass, the beer is attractive to look at. The smell is or orange, and the taste also is citrusy with not much carbonation. This tastes almost like a mixed orange alcoholic drink than a beer, but is a nice change of pace. Enjoyed it more than Sam Adams White Ale, another Witbier. Mouthfeel is very good -- easy to drink & a nice, refreshing flavor. Glad I gave it a try."
"Drinkability- Very easy to drink. A beer for the summer and a beer that needs to be drank between 40-45 degrees f."
"It has a slightly copper color and an average size head. It really had a citrusy aroma (I know the orange had something to do with that). Being a Coors product, I was really impressed about how it actually tasted Belgian. The flavor has a little kick to it, as well. It was relatively smooth and drinkable."
"I can't believe I'm drinking a Coors product, and I can't believe a Coors product is actually decent. Gotta call 'em as I drink 'em, and for this one, I can only give Coors a thumbs up (almost makes me want to shudder...). Let it be a lesson: always look to the Belgians to steer you right on beer. Even Coors did well by doing so. Blue Moon has become less impressive to me over repeated tastings, but it has stiff competition from not only its much better Belgian counterparts, but from other U.S. micros that are more authentic. But for what it is, it's alright...I'm definitely not in the Blue Moon Hater camp."
"I sometimes forget about this one. I had it numerous times and was always slightly intrigued, but not blown away. Only later learning it was by Coors and is considered a macro. This gives it a bit of an aura as the 'better of the worst' sort of thing and for that it is admirable. A good cheap backup but not something you'd seek out repeatedly. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall, I was very impressed by this offering from Coors. I almost have trouble beleiving that they made this. I would definitely have another, in the event nothing better is around."
"A hazy canary yellow with a head that quickly fades to fizz. There were also a few chunks of darker yellow yeast clumps that poured toward the end. The smell isn't bad -clearly wheaty and a hint of lemon. Tastes not-too-strong; not terribly challenging with a hint of lemon. Not the big spicy notes that I've come to expect in a Wit. Very mild and not bad, but not too exciting."
"All in all not that bad a beer for something brewed by coors...as far as macro's go this one is pretty wonderful, beats the pants of most swill, but I wouldn't drop change on these to often and I'm glad I got a really good deal on this sixer."
"In my mind, this is a pretty average witbier. I know its sales are pretty good, and while it is made by BMC, I know a lot of macro drinkers who favor it. It is pretty mellow, even for a wit, but there is a very slight spiciness that flows throughout the sip. It is pretty sweet, but far from syrupy or unpleasant. On the whole, it is pretty drinkable and not budget-breaking, but there are other witbeers that I would purchase before Blue Moon."
"I'll probably never buy Coors products myself, choosing to support a true micro, or at least, a more regional micro (e.g., Leinies, Point), if I am feeling cheap or the selection is limited. Still, I gotta give this one it's due."
"This is a good session beer. It's flavorful, but not overwhelming. The orange added is a very nice touch. Good for a spring or summer day or evening."
" This is drinkable stuff although it would have to be a pretty weak selection for me to choose this at a bar or beer distributor."
"Very good beer. Easy to drink and equally unique. Often served with an orange this adds a little to the sweetness and also makes the drinking more fun in a corny way. This beer is quite tasty and should be explored if you like sweet brews. Taste identical to Sam Adams White Ale..."
"Had one at the Atlas Diner with dinner. Served ice-cold with a thin slice of orange laid flat that completely covered the surface of the glass. (So much for seeing what kind of head this beer has). The head was a thin covering after I removed the offending orange slice. Color was hazy orange. Not much nose. The taste was very pleasant. The sweetness is not overpowering and the fruity tastes is very mild. The bitterness in the followup taste is good, gives the beer some character. Drinkability is good, I could see myself having a few on a hot day or with food. I had a St Bernardus Witbier once and this is not the same thing. That being said, it is still a big improvement on Coor's Lite. Good on ya Coors, you can make a beer with some actual flavor."
"good mouthfeel and drinkability, its possible to drink a lot of these in a night"
"Drinkability; Easy to drink"
"This beer pours a murky orange color with little or no head. The crisp hoppy aroma is immediately tantalizing. Upon tasting, I am hit by a strong lemon flavor, and Im afraid little follows that first, rather overbearing, taste. Its also a bit too thin and watery. I would say overall that its crisp and light and not totally unenjoyable on a warm day, but it could use a lot more complexity and body."
"Notes: just too one dimensional. Not enough balance between the citrus and the coriander. As for the appearance the head retention could use some serious work. Overall, its the best mass produced wit, but dumbed down for the masses. The complexity from the yeast of a genuine Wit and that slight hint of acidic twang in the finish just isn't there. If you can't get a hold of some Hoegaarden, this would work as a substitute. The plus side that it is cheap."
"One of the best mass-produced Witbiers in the US."
"mouthfeel is light and creamy at the same time. crisp. drinkability is pretty good. overall impressed that this is a coors product."
"overall not a bad brew for a macro. not very sharp tasting, average for an ale. Not bad, and not very expensive. would go well with food, since it would not overpower. Nothing really specatular about it, but overall pretty descent. Will probably try again when the selections are few...avaliable at super market...."
"Pours easy and goes down easy not a whole lot of substance. Widely available at many bars and distributers makes it more of a beer of choice than it should be at times, but never a bad choice."
"This is a beer that is a good introduction to craft beer for people who have previously only drank light American lagers. It shows that there is a whole other world of beer without assaulting them with bitterness and caramel/roasty flavors."
"Smells and tastes fruity and citrusy, the latter probably aided by the accompaniment on the side of the glass. The waitress tried to push a Blue Moon mixed with a shot of Citron. Pretty good for drinking several in one night, especially on Wednesdays when it's on special at Po' Boys' ;)"
"Drinkability: Usually not my choice but I enjoyed it. Had one with a roast beef, potatoes and spinach dinner. Worked very well with food. Will have another."
"The body is moderate, a touch sweet for style. Carbonation is good. Overall a bit fruity for style but still good."
"DI like it. A good standby when your tap choices are limited. I had it with a big plate of buffalo chicken wings and it complemented them nicely."
"This pours a clear yellow straw with very little head. The smell has some yeast and bakery like aromas with some lemon. The taste has a wheat lemon flavor with some citrus and coriander flavors. The m/f is light,but the balance is weak with a very watery aftertaste. Not horrible, but I don't think I'd buy this again. Still for Coors,this isn't all bad."
"Drinkability: A great summer brew (why I'm drinking it in the winter, I don't know), and a crowd-pleaser at parties. It lacks the zesty kick of other wits (I long for a Hitachino Nest White Ale), but it would still be a great match for sweet-and-sour and mildly spicy foods."
"This beer is incredibly good. Just short of the Belgian excellence that Sam Adams White Ale has achieved, but just short. My number two beer for beers that can purchased at the grocery store. A thick beer with exceptional tastate."
"D  Excellent session beer. One of my personal favorites with pizza and hot wings. Bars like to put a slice of orange on the edge, which helps bring out the citrus even more."
"Just average, all around. I wouldn't buy it again. I wasn't expecting too much out of it, so I was pleasantly surprised by the good, up front flavor. It quickly dissipated, however leaving me wanting for something more than that nice approach. Toward the end of my glass, I just wanted to be done with it. The wheat taste was muted and a bit weak, so if it's a true wheat beer you're looking for, maybe look elsewhere. But the beer was by no means bad or offensive, just lacking."
"Other than that, it was drinkable b/c there was nothing else on tap other than super swill. Sort of a micro/import wannabee's kind of drink."
"I think this will be my lawnmover beer of choice this summer."
"Blue moon is just one of those beers that you can't dislike. It please men, women, the young and the old. Pours from the tap with a medium to thick head and creamy yellowish orange in color. Smells of citrus and cloves. Taste is that of ripe orange. On tap the flavor is slightly watered down which is why I rate it below 4.5 to 5 as I would the bottle. This beer goes down smooth as well. Dollar for the dollar this is one of the better beers to buy when you are partying or you are having a beer tasting session."
"Residual sugars are too much"
"Update: I continue to like this beer more and more. Its become on the easy drinking beers when I relax. It is really good and very affordable. I have bumped the numbers up. I still cant believe that this is produced by a Macrobrewery."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a typical wit color. It is a cloudy golden color with a little bit of a white head. I also noted some sediment on the bottom of the bottle. When did this become bottle conditioned? The aroma is a bit more malty than I would like. The wheat is in there, but it is not as prevalent as the norm with this style. Also, the typical corriander and orange are hard to pick out. The wheat is there in the taste, but as the aroma, it is too subdued. Too much malt body to it. Fair."
"Light and somewhat drinkable if you can get past the somewhat-annoying sweetness."
"Nose is almost non-existant. I wonder if it would be better at room temperature. Taste and mouthfeel are extremely light. There are none of the traditional aromas or flavors of a Witbier. In fact, there is little flavor at all. If I didn't pour it myself, I'd think I was drinking one of those ghastly ""light"" beers. I was not at all impressed. IMHO, save your bucks for something with more flavor and body."
"Very aromatic, almost sweet flower like, however, a little over carbonated. This beer for me goes great with fried appetizers, or cheese and sausage. An excellent choice for an ""americanized"" wheat beer."
"Pours a cloudy orange yellow with bright white head, which has some ability to stick to the glass. Smells of citrus. Lots of carbonation- so much so that I noticed the yeast particles in this beer having a hard time settling down as they were in a constant state of cycling down mid-glass only to be brough back up by bubbles. Has a creamy cheese taste to it that I haven't experienced in any other beer. One of the first non-macro beers I tried and it was one influence in opening my eyes to other styles of beer, so for that I am greatful."
"D: I do love this style of beer, this isn't the best I've had in the style but pretty darn good. You can usually find this beer even in bars that are Bud/Miller/Coors heavy cause its very popular, therefore its usually kind of a fall back beer for me."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is one of my personal favorites I have had it in abottle and on tap. If there is a beer I want with my meal it is this one. It pours a creamy yellow color and a nice smaller white head. some places serve it with an orange on the glass I prefer to throw that to the side right away. the taste is so smooth, fills the mouth with flavour but not to much, this is why it is good with food it will not overwhelm your food. this beer is common from what i have seen so if you havent had it do so."
"This has quickly become one of my favorite beers. Like the guy whose review is just below me, Coors briefly had me thinking this stuff came from a microbrewer. And let me say I'm also impressed Coors was able to make this. This was my introduction to Belgian Whites, and its quickly become one of my favorite beers. The color is a sort of light gold, but on the cloudy side. The head pretty tall and better formed than I would have expected in such a fizzy beer. The smell is very pleasant with some citrus and a little bit of spice besides. Taste is pleasant and refreshing. It's light, with some sweetness, and some sourness that adds pleasant depth, rather than a perception cheap hops. Plus there's a bit of spice in there. Mouthfeel is fizzy and fairly light, though not at all watery. Drinkability is pretty good because this is a light and very pleasant beer. But not great because of the acidity. Hop presence is rather slight since a lot of the flavor comes from spice and other flavorings. I'd definately reccomend this, although I have to admit Hacker-Schorr Weiss was definately better still. It was a surprisingly decent introduction to a new category for me, and if I couldn't find, or didn't want to pay for a bottle of that Hacker-Schorr Weiss, then this would be my choice for someone who's new to beer, or who says they don't like beer."
"It has good carbonation which is appropriate for the style, and overall I'm pretty impressed Coors came up with this. I don't think I would have ever tried it if they didn't trick me into thinking Blue Moon Brewing company was some kind of microbrewery!"
"Very high drinkability. I could have several without getting sick of it."
"Drinkability: very nice."
"Average wheat beer. Not a great head, but nice inital aroma. Has a clean finish, and has a lot of orange and a slight oily feel to the taste. Would be good if nothing else is on tap. Also distributed by Coors, which can be deceptive as its not on the box. Hate big brewers hiding their labels."
"The body was alright, and it was actually refreshing. Not something that I would really buy in the winter, but if it were summer time and not much else was on tap I could grab one or three and be happy."
"Not a bad for a beer coming from Coors. This is a great choice if they do not have any micro beers on tap. It has more flavors then other Macro Lagers that many chain restaurants offer."
"Taste is similar: spice, malt, fruit (grapefruit & banana). Nicely balanced. Though not terribly complex, way above average for a megabrew. A touch rough around the edges. Medium-bodied. A solid beer but not a great one. Considering the source, a good effort and one I purchased regularly when it was available locally in bottles."
"I know most of you belgian fans dig your chimay blue, but as for as blue moon and the wibier's go, best type of beer to form out of mainstream wheat."
"D - Nothing great but nothing offensive. Doesn't keep you coming back for more like crazy but is one that you can drink as a session brew. I get why my one friend who's basically a light beer only drinker likes this stuff as well. Not a whole lot going on, nothing complex, but a clean taste that goes down easy."
"This is a pretty good beer. I enjoy this quite often, It pours well with just little head. It didnt really lace the glass at all. It is a golden orange color and smells somewhat like oranges, I guess thats why they sometimes put an orange on the glass at bars. The carbonation is nice, not to powerful. very drinkable but It is somewhat filling, I could only drink a 6 pack or so before getting full. Its made by Coors but is a much better macro than most. I reccomend this beer to someone looking for a good macro with a pretty good rep. overall good."
"Pours out with a white fine- bubble head that dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. Interesting orange color. Smells mostly of bergamot/ orange peel. On tasting it, I can tell they found the orange peel/ coriander, but they do almost all the work in the flavor profile here. A little bread/ wheat flavor, but not as richly as I like. Drinks easy and quickly. One of the better macros, a nice party beer- but not too complex/ refined."
"The mouthfeel is is decent, a bit foamy. Drinkablility is good. Its not a bad beer, but for the price there are better options."
"Drinkability  Very easy to drink, tastes like an exotic macro. Potentially a good introduction to the style because it is so easy to drink and not very complex. No clue it was from Coors until I came to post the review."
"Pours a very cloudy golden orange. One finger of fine bubbles shows decent retention and leaves some patchy lacing. Orange peel and yeast dominate the nose, with some floral hop notes in the background. The orange flavor rushes out upfront, with a nice yeast bite, and citrusy hops in the aftertaste that balance the swettness. High carbonation and a light body leave a mildy dry finish and a marvelous mouthfeel. A little shy on the wheat flavor, and perhaps overkill with the citrus, but makes an excellent session ale for any season."
"12 oz. with Feb. '05 on the bottle. Another old one from Mike's Mart.... Pours a cloudy piss gold color that is too yellow for a witbier and a 1 finger white head that leaves some trails of lace. Smells of coriander, orange peel, bready yeast, and maybe some metal. Light body with high carbonation and a lot of orange peel, along with coriander, yeast, toasty malts, sweet wheat, fruit, and some mustiness. Actually pretty good for a macro past the freshness date and better than most other macro offerings. Will drink again but probably won't go and buy some for myself."
"Not terrible, I could see myself drinking this again, just not paying for it."
"I suggest that you try it first with nothing, then with a slice of orange or lemon. I know, I know. Scores of people think that it is a sin to put fruit in beer, but hey, ya' never know. Try it."
"The makers of this brew were able to pack a lot of flavor in there, too bad (in my opinion) it was all way too much orange and not enough complexity."
"Smell was very much of citrus like orange scents. Taste is citrus as well mostly orange in flavor. Some spice in there as well not as much as Id like to see but it was good none the less. Nice amount of carbonation and balance. A well put together afforadable beer."
"Drinkability: Yes"
"Hazy golden color. Aroma & taste are all subtle..but has soft citrus & mild spicy qualities. Bready malt qualities and not a ton of hop character, but still tastes good. A solid fallback beer, as it's made by one of the big 3. Quite drinkable and something you can get at many bars when they only offer BMC."
"Blue moon is a very affordable and readily available wheat beer, which I find to be a rare combination. In the glass it fades from the side to bright gold, to a murky orange in the middle. Its a nice effect in a pint glass. Smells like bubblegum and oranges with a little wheat. The taste has a little currant and citrus in it but theres some sour corn there as well. The body is thin, but with a complimentary creaminess with the carbonation. you get an all right taste for an all right price here."
"For what it is- available, cheap, and decent tasting- I love it. Have it with a slice of orange, and you can't go wrong. Your friends will be intrigued that you are drinking it, and you will be glad that you found a decent tasting beer among the BCM at the local bar!"
"Drinkability  This is a drinkable, enjoyable beer that is overly criticized by beer snobs, but enjoyed by those drinking and not overthinking their beers."
"I find that Blue Moon Belgian White is a crisp, clean example of style, lacking only in the subtle rustic neuonces of a true Belgian Witbier"
"Crisp and clean finish. This would be great for a tailgating party on hot summer days. I think most people would find this a good medium for beer geeks and macro geeks."
"The head on this beer is decent, not too much, not too little. This beer's cloudy appearance that gives this beer character but can be intimidating the the drinker until he puts it up to his face. The first thing that gets the drinker is the smell, it is unique and you can somewhat smell the orange peel. Don't let the weak smell fool you though. This beer has a powerful and very smooth and flavorful taste that goes down solid and lets you remember how good it really is. The drinkabilty is good and, from what I hear, a slice of orange makes this beer unforgetable. Give it shot, you won't regret it."
"The taste of this beer is very interesting. At first I didn't know what to make of the taste. After thinking about it for a while I discovered that this beer reminded me of fruit loops.To me that is exactly what it tastes like. The carbonation in this beer is just about right, not overwhelming but not flat either. It goes down smoothly and is easy to drink. As to drinkability, I like the stuff but I don't think that I could drink too much of it. After a while the taste of fruit loops would just be too much."
"Very drinkable, as it is safe enough to appeal to the masses. I won't mind drinking these in the future, although it will likely be a last resort beer when there is nothing better to hvae. It won't satisfy a craving for belgian0-style beer either."
"This is a strange sort of beer as it is billed as a Belgian Wit but tastes nothing like one. The yeast is definitely not noticeable so it can't be the traditional Belgian trappist yeast that is used in other Belgian Wits like Hoegaarden and soforth. I think the only way Blue Moon can be considered Belgian is in the spicing, which is quite good. I really don't like the funky tasting trappist yeast anyway, so this beer really caters to my unique tastes. The color is an attractive orange that is very cloudy due to the wheat and excess yeast. I have actually had a craving for this brew upon holding it up to the light and seeing the baeutiful way it glows. It may be important to note that this beer DOES NOT go well with pizza."
"This tastes pretty citrusy and fairly smooth. It isn't strong in the spice area, at all but does retain some wheat essence. Smooth and goes down easy. Surprisingly good, especially on a warm day."
"Opinion: I am surprised that this came out of the facility of a macro brew! There is actually some flavor in this one. It is light and a bit too one dimensional for my taste, but it could easily be a crowd pleaser. It's not one I would seek out, but I would sure as hell take it over anything else I have tried from Coors so far."
"I really enjoyed this the first time I had it DC9, but with several additional tastings under my belt, I can firmly say my first impression was a bad one. It pours a cloudy off-white color with minimal head. Slight buttery smell seems interesting; that's what must have caught my attention the first few times. The taste is rather unfinished; that's the best I can describe it. It seems as if the beer hasn't aged properly or was stored incorrectly. A rather bland taste altogether with just subtle flavors; but not enjoyable really. After a sip or two, my mouth was exhausted. It's one of the few 'not so mass produced' beers at DC9 even though it's owned by Coors, so I'll probably have this again if I go there unless they get some beers on-tap. It's worth a taste now and again, but not too often."
"Not an awful beer, but not something I will go out of my way to get again. It did match very well with a sweet ginger chicken dish we had for supper tonight."
"I had tried Blue Moon on tap and finally found it in the bottle. Happily, I can report that the bottled version this above-average wheat beer it is virtually identical. Pours a dusky translucent gold color with a huge fluffy head which unfortunately fades fairly quickly to nothing. Citrus/grapefruit nose typical of most witbiers Ive sampled. The first thing that strikes you upon drinking is the almost annoyingly bubbly mouth. However, that quickly fades to solid witbier flavor: predominantly citrus (I call it grapefruit) and wheat, so sweet as to be almost cloying. Drinkability is good, though perhaps too bubbly. Slightly bitter finish. Overall, this is a decent wheat beer; Id say slightly above average. Yes, this beer is made by Coors, but dont let that stop you from trying it."
"Drinkability is limited subject, I only drank the two because of my previous comment. In my opinion half of this one would have been enough."
"If someone handed me a Blue Moon... I'd drink it. If there were other choices of this style and I was in the mood... I wouldn't purchase it. Thanks."
"Pours with a three-finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Light cloudy amber color with some yeast left in the bottle. Light bodied and light carbonation. Nose is wheat. Starts with some sweetness, some cloves and a clean finish. Nice. $5.74 for a 6-pack of 12oz from Super Walmart Concord, NH. Label has it brewed by Blue Moon Brewing Co."
"Nicely cloudy, dark gold, topped with a half-finger off-white head that completely disappears almost instantly. Spicey wheat dominates the nose, slight citrus as well. Gentle carbonation up front, medium body, sweet citrus and yeasty flavors with a bit of coriander . Smooth going down, though finishes with a slight fruit acridity. Not a true Belgian wheat, but not bad either, a middle-of-the-road offering."
"Ok, so this beer is brewed by one of the ""Big Boys", but hey, at least Coors has stepped it up a little and tried something different, for them at least. Judge this beer against true belgian wit beers and it fails miserably, but judged on its own, it's not a bad beer. Pours a light golden caramel color and nice and cloudy like a wit should be. Head tends to fall rather rapidly. Aroma is nice and spicy with a hint of coriander and citrus, but very faint. Flavor is solid. It has most of the components that a wit beer should have, but just not of it. This beer was definately created to appeal to the masses who are looking for something a little different but not too far out of their norm. It's a very drinkable beer, easy to find yourself comsuming pint after pint especially in a bar where this is the farthest from the ""standards"" that you will come. My hope for this beer is that someone will drink it and be interested enough by its slightly different taste to break out of their MGD induced trance and start on the road to true beer enlightenment."
"Overall, a decent offering by macro standards, but pretty substandard for a wit."
"This is a great everyday beer. I enjoy the cloudy look the head if i could change one thing about the pour it would be the head, it is weak and does not last. The smell is very citrus and extremely enjoyable. As far as taste goes for a macro this beer stands up it isn't overly impressive but decent. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy as a witbier should be. Overall I will continue to drink this beer at barbecues, ball games, and anywhere that I need an affordable beer."
"I think that Coors Brewing company did a pretty damn good job for a macrobrewer at making a belgian white with that American microbrew flavor. This Blue Moon pours a cloudy yellow, not quite golden color. The scent is wheat and citrus. Quite a nice scent. My second one I had with an orange, which was nice as well. The flavor was sweet and flavorful. The flavors of lemon, orange, and wheat were quite present. All in all a nice smooth refreshing white beer. For the price and convienience, I would definitely recommend it."
"Pours a dull yellowish orange with a thin off white head and a slight bit of lacing. Smell is very lemony, with some faint spiciness coming through as well. Taste has a strong wheat malt presence and a weak lemon and orange peel flavor, and hardly any spices present at all. A little on the thin side, the carbonation level is high for a palate cleansing feel. Unoffending but not particularly interesting, this is probably the best beer I've had but out by one of the big 3."
"Four things conspire to make this a good thirst-quenching summer beer. The citrus adds an evident sharp cut. The wheat, by the nature of how it behaves in the mash, strengthens this sharpness with a slightly acidic touch. The fizzy carbonation puts an edge on the beer. And the coriander cleans up the beer and lends a crisp top dressing overall. The only real complaint I have is that they don't do quite enough; the beer could be lighter and more quenching."
"The taste is all orange zest coriander. Spicy and refreshing, creamy smooth. An decent wheat ale."
"A muted version of a great style. Looks murky and lemon yellow. Nice head with great retention, nice lacing. Smells lightly sweet, citrusy, and griny. Dominated by sour lemon and orange rind aromas. Not as much belgian tarness as expected. Tastes citrusy and mildly sweet. Lemons, banannas, and spices come through. Still lacks dept and sweetness. Leaves the palate a bit scrubbed and grainy. Becomes watery into finish. Fades quickly. A better beer than is expected from Coors, but still a far cry from a Hoegaardden."
"poured a nice hazy orangish ciolor with a moderate white head. Smell is spicy with a nice background of cloves. Taste seems to reveal corriander along with the cloves and is pleasant to the tongue. Aftertaste leaves the remaines ot the spiciness. Overall a good beer at a good price."
"On it's own this is a reasonable alternative to bad beer, but it falls flat for the style."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I tried this one again. From the bottle it was better than from the tap, and a lively beer and a good summer taste. Because this is more available, I could see buying this for daytime cookouts. Good wheat."
"overall- i was suprised with this since it comes from the same people that make coors. very smooth and crisp taste. easy to find and worth a try."
"Being that Blue Moon is available on tap at basically every bar I've gone to lately, and given its extremely easy drinkability, it's become my ""go-to"" beer when nothing else really interests me. This is a beer I could drink all night."
"Notes: I'm glad to see Coors branching out a bit to this style. It's not the best Witbier, but it certainly is more adventurous than some of the other offerings of the Big Three. A pleasant surprise."
"1.5 finger head that dissipates quickly. pale yellow with chill haze expected from un-filtered wheat beer. citrus and spiciness to the nose. smells great. malt sweetness ansd hop bittering very balanced. dry finish. smells get even better as beer warms. blue moon rocks. oh yeah, i'm not so fond of coors either, but this definitely is not a coors lite. if they marketed this beer with scantily clad fine chicks it could become my favorite."
"Good summer beer. I keep this stocked for my neighbor. He drinks it with an orange slice. Cloudy yellow witbier color, nice fruity and clovy aroma. Minimal head, avg lacing. Taste is refreshing, nothing strong. Good ""lawnmower"" quality. I never thought I'd say this...but not bad for a Coors product. Worth a try."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow body, with a frothy white head. Aroma of cloves, citrus and lemon. Light bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Taste of cloves, some spice, some tartness and ends dry. A pretty good product from Coors. Has ok flavour, easy drinking and a decent wit when nothing else is around."
"Not bad, I seem to remember liking this more before I started in on other great Witbiers."
"Big bubbles of quickly dyeing carbonation land to a flat mouthfeel supported by a light, watery body. In spite of all it's shortcomings, it is still easy to drink, almost like soda. 5$ a sixer...good for budget drinking or for cooling off on a hot day. I can hardly even compare it to Troublette or Ommegang Witte."
"Served a translucent yellow with a thin white head and an orange slice, the orange is nice for appearance, but I decided to remove it. A really soft and sweet aroma, slight citrus and even slighter spice. The flavor was sweet and slightly spicey, with strong malt flavors. The body was good, the beer smooth, but it seemed to be a little light on the carbonation, perhaps due to the slice of orange. Overall a good beer, but Id rather have an Oberon, a Whitsun, or a Zoomer Wit."
"I know everyone on here loves hoegaarden, but to me that was really dissapointing. This is hell of a lot more refreshing. It smells so nice and sweet, wheatey and fruity. The head is gorgeous and it looks great. It is carbonated and very hazy. It tastes great, really refreshing too. The spices are interesting. Wheaty and sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Very drinkable."
"This was a lot better than I would have thought it to be. I like the label; think it's a really nice package. However, the thought of American made 'knock-off' Belgian white ale just doesn't sound appealing to me. I am, however, very glad I gave it a go. Its smell is a bit musty with a hint of fruit and some faint malt. The taste is a little sweet but not very strong. I'd say pleasantly sweet, and with a touch of hops, too. It's quite cloudy and yellowy - orange in colour. It's quite smooth and very easy to drink. A wonderful brew for the warmer weather!!"
"Next time I'll try a six pack,or maybe a twelve!!"
"Drinkability: Decent. I wouldn't make a habit of drinking this, but it'll be a nice alternative."
"*http://www.obliquity.com/astro/seasonal.html"
"On tap at Old Chicago as part of Spring mini tour. Cloudy pour, with a decent sized head. Served with an orange as seems to be the trendy thing to do. To avoid scurvy I decided to eat the orange, but it didn't make it in my beer. Taste is not bad for a wit - hints of coriander and wheat. Enjoyable brew, but I wish people didn't call it a microbrew!"
"The taste is pretty decent. Fresh, wet mouthfeel. Blue flavors abound. Nary a hint of bitterness. Mostly sweet and wheat beer tones. Some apple and orange. Juicy and refreshing. I can drink these all day in the summertime. Taken for what it is, this one is a sure winner when faced with the common drab of beer cooler boredom. I have never had a bad one off the tap which is where I usually come into contact with this beer. Not bad."
"I find this a better beer than most people do, even better than some genuine Belgians like Sterkens. It's not my favorite wit but it's a quite drinkable."
"I paid $1.75 a glass"
"Note - I have had this both from tap and bottle and, IMHO, there is a very discernable difference. Tap is much better if you can get it."
"Hard to believe this is a Coors product. Also hard to believe I've never reviewed it as this is usually my ""go to beer"" when presented with the standard BMC lineup that so many sports bars, etc carry. Pours a murky orange amber. Scent is very fruity, slightly yeasty. Taste is very very smooth, lots of orange and corriander. Creamy in a Dreamsickle kinda way. If not consumed fresh though it loses most of its redeeming characteristics. I've also found that a lot of places will overcarbonate this stuff or maybe it's just gotten that way from being around too long in their systems. Either way, a very drinkable beer from one of the big boys. When grading for adhereance to the style though, I'd probably give it a C."
"Cloudy light orange color. Head renetion is ok. Starts ok, about one finger and then settles to a lace around the glass. Smells like lemon, coriander, and some wheat malt. No aroma too strong. Taste is average for the style. Coriander, orange peel, and some wheat malts balance well. A small amount of hops. Everything is there, but kind of weak. Medium bodied. Very tasty for a Coors product."
"On-tap, 23 oz draft at Kriegers served with an orange slice. Sort-of a cloudy dark yellow, bordering bright orange hue, decent white head. An aroma of wheat, coriander and some lemon peel. Medium in body; delicately creamy, hints of wheat, lemon and orange peel up front, sweet malts and an on-going grainy presence. Zesty hops with some yeasty/lightly peppered tastings. Imagine that  a decent offering, from one of the big 3, a good fall-back beer, pretty consistent and enjoyable for the style."
"Slàinte!"
"Pretty good overall. I""ll have to try others in this style to compare."
"Anyway, the 22oz bomber pour was a hazy amber, but the orange slice seemed to kill the head quickly. No matter, the Wit was still smooth, well balanced between the weat malts and citrus hops. Not sure if the orange aroma was from the beer or the slice. Very nice texture  could drink these all night. Oops, think I did. Have to say, a good *micro* from a *macro*."
"NOTE: Ratings may be adjusted when I have more of the style to compare to. For now I am comparing it to wheat beers I have had (I know, probably a mistake, but this is how I see it)."
"This brew surprised me. I bought it knowing full well it is a coors product. This meant I was expecting very little. Well I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. A great summertime brew while barbecuing. Believe it or not I would buy this one again! Shame that Coors cant make their other products like this!"
"I get the same stomach cramps I do from Bud and Coors from drinking this beer. Certainly not a good session ale."
"A relatively drinkable lighter brew that is widely available and almost Not a fine example of the style, but I like to buy a case of this when I have macro drinkers over to watch a game or for a party. It's not too expensive, and people seem to like it and think of it as a micro. Nicely done, Coors."
"Another beer left in my fridge. I have to try and keep off the good beers till my drinking buddy returns from work related leave. This beer pours a light peachy color with a 2 finger head that falls to a small coating over top of the beer. The nose is oriander orangey, but with a slightly creamy tone, reminding me of a orange cream popsicle. The flavor is much the same as the nose, but with a slightly wheaty undertone in there. The feel is moderate to thick, somewhat creamy. Overall, not bad for a beer made by BMC. It was always my fall back beer before I went off the deep end 5 months ago, and it is still not bad. Definately not something I will keep in my fridge, but I won't turn my nose up when people leave it behind in my fridge."
"Surprisingly decent, courtesy on tap in Orlando at Underground Bluz. Smooth enough thought it was a micro. Nice wheaty appearance, good aroma, smeet though citrusy. Refreshing carbonation. Medium of the road mouthfeel. Coors? Did they buy this brewery?"
"LOTS of carbonation! I bought a six-pack, drove two blocks over nice road, opened the bottle, and foam poured out all over my jeans. Sheesh. The appearance of Blue Moon is as one would expect from an unfiltered Wheat Ale, a pale yellow that is quite cloudy. Some lacing and an aroma that is lightly citrusy with a dash of wheat and nutmeg. Medium body, somewhat sweet with a creamy malt middle and little hops. Pepper and spice dominate, light yeast and some corn last to the nice dry finish. Perfect for people who say they don't like beer, but I miss the hops."
"A suprisingly good product from Coors. I had this one for 2 bucks a pint at the local watering hole and it was good stuff. It poured a cloudy gold color with a very nice head and nice lace was left on my glass. The beer did not have much smell but it did have was a very inviting, light and airy aroma of malt and corriander. I thought the flavor was great and very drinkable with its sweet front end that was tasty and not cloying at all. The beer was balanced out nicely with a small hop presence and a nice citrus twang. Overall, I'm impressed and would gladly order this one again."
"this is a good beer and definitely worth trying, the price makes it a beer that i will buy pretty often."
"I've never seen this beer in the Houston area so I just had to pick it up while in San Antonio. Belgian White's appearance is a hazy golden orange with a nice foamy head. The aroma is of wheat with a zesty lemon smell. Taste is similar to the aroma, wheat with a lemon taste. The mouthfeel is crisp and assertive. Drinkability is very good. A rare beer by one of the big 3 that I recommend to all."
"I'll pass and look for something better."
"The drinkability is not good and the after taste has a lingering musky sweet taste that is not desirable for me cause I know better."
"Overall- a decent beer. Very surprising knowing its from Coors?! I recommend if given 1 but don't buy it."
"Drinkability is good; not my first choice but I would pick this over any Bud-Miller-Coors available."
"Something I'd get if my choices were limited."
"Not at all bad. Easily the best Coors product I've had and given the right circumstances, I'd order this again. Cheers!"
"from the tap. poured a cloudy yellowwith hardly any head and no lacing did not put the orange in that they servered with it as a garnish. aroma, yeast, citrus, orange and lemon.flavor about the same.smooth could be one of those you could have a few of not to bad"
"Always a favorite to recommend to others not so inclined to trying out non-light beers, especially with that orange slice. This has been my final beer of the night choice, especially if I've had some heavier nut browns or porters earlier. Hazy appearance will never be my personal choice, but it is a belgian style wheat. Nothing too special about the smell or mouthfeel, but no issues with these characteristics either. Can drink this wheat all evening. Plus, Blue Moon is available more and more at nearby restauarants and is always a good option."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated DEC26 04 {edit:ohmygosh, it's a Belgian in a screw-top!} It's a dull,hazy. golden yellow. Had an off-white foamy to sudsy 1/2 finger head, despite the fact I poured aggressively into a clean glass trying for a bigger head. The head excused itself fairly quickly, before one or two sips. The nose was nice! It promised a taste of fruits, oranges, cloves, malt with some yeasts. But, the taste disappointed me some...lacking something there in the middle. The aftertaste was dry and a bit sour. I kept going back for more sips and mouthfuls, trying to sort out what I was tasting- A bit of wheat, some apricot-like sweeteness with some other fruits and spicyness. As it warmed more the wheat/malt diminished and the tartness increased. Didn't make me want another."
"Ahhhh, it figures; a Coors product. I have had a few of these and never was impressed and now the true light comes out. I had one left from the six pack, which is actually kinda old. Maybe 8 months kinda old. But, seeing that it is a Coors product, I don't think it's going to make a difference. Pours with a small head that is gone in a flash. Zero, zilch, nil lacing anywhere. Kinda of a brownish-orange color with chunks of yeast all over the place. In fact, if anybody has seen the movie Strange Brew....you know when the dog starts drinking the beer from his dog dish, then they throw him a donught to get him away from the beer because it was their dad's last beer. Then they poured what was left from the dog dish into a glass? That's what this beer looks like. Maybe not as much chunky dog food, but looks pretty nasty nonetheless. Smells at least decent. Smells of wheat, maybe a hop somewhere. Tastes like wheat, coriander, maybe some citrus in there. A little pepper or some kind of spicyness. Kinda flat also. Not awful, but pretty lame. Don't even want to look at it with all those floating things. Naaa, I'll pass on this one."
"In the first few weeks of legal drinking I ordered a Blue Moon at an Irish pub and recommended that my mom did as well. Her first comment was that the beer tasted like vegetables. I had my next sip and suddenly I was convinced my mouth was filled with creamed vegetables. This isn't the greatest beer, but it is far from the worst. While I find it hard to point out what would distinguish it from anyone other American white beer, I think that's the point. This is an intro beer. Since it is produced by Unibev you can get it anywhere. Since it isn't a weak lager, it gives many people their first taste of something different and for that cheers."
"Well, this was a pretty good session beer. It had a really nice cloudy haze to it. The taste was refreshing, albeit a bit on the lighter side. I could actually drink a few bottles of this while playing cards. It was refreshing... maybe i'm thinking this because i found out it was by Coors. I was really surprised. I guess they could make a decent beer after all."
"Appearance is well above the macrobrew average, with actual color and a bit of haze in a - hold on to your hats, unfiltered macro brew! Little smell comes through, but notes of fruit pop now and again. Taste is acceptable, this is clearly not a style-defining or bursting Belgian Wit, but it is recognizable. The relatively high score is a nod to it's coors heritage - I want to try to encourage adolph to brew more beers like this and fewer like Aspen. Beer is easily drinkable, due to it's lack of agressive traits. One could easily drink several in a sitting, if only the taste provided some justification to such behavior."
"As some the first time i found out it was a coors product i didnt buy it. Later i decided to try blue moon and was actualy very supprised at the complexity of the beer. I have had other white belgin style brews that where flat. This is a very complex and drinkable beer. I am particularly keen on wheat beers and this one is definatly a keeper."
"Blue Moon is light and tastey. It has typical wheat beer atributes; cloudy orangish yellow with a creamy head. The beer drinks well, and has a nice head that leaves a very nicely laced glass."
"Also, this beer is great on tap. If you ever eat at O'Charleys restaraunts try it with the Black and bleu caeser salad. It is a great combo."
"Pours a light pale yellow with no head and no lacing. Best looking ""macro"" I've seen in a while. Now what bothered me about this beer is the smell and the taste. For me there was one overpowering characteristic - sunscreen. I don't know why and only one other person has agreed with me, but I couldn't get it out of my mind that it tasted like sunscreen. There were other hints at citrus and pepper, but they were very deep in the background. Felt decent on the mouth - a bit too much carbonation tho. And this would be a drinkable beer for me if it didn't taste like sunscreen. Not bad for Coors though. I'd say try it when not much else is available."
"This beer is not good for this style. Infact it is not good at all.I hated the taste, and I can't finish it. Terrible!!"
"Hazing golden pour with a light white head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a nice thin lace. Light sweet malts and grains on the nose and in flavor. The body is weak and leaves a dry aftertaste. There are much better beers of this style available, but it is average by itself."
"Not offensive so I'd consider it easy to drink."
"Final Thought: I had this a few months ago before I was a BA and loved it, now it is just losing stock in my beer portfolio..."
"Pours a cloudy, hazy pale orange color, light fruity and yeasty aromas, small white foamy head that doesn't last too long. Spicy wheat and orange flavors, very sweet and tart for the style, medium body with a soft mouthfeel finishes sweet, a bit better than I expected, just a little sweeter than I like."
"Pouring this out of a keg was a real task. Even with a good poor I was left with half a cup full of head. We resulted in filling a pitcher full first then pouring that into the cups. This was not the first time I have had Blue Moon, but it was the best tasting Blue Moon I have had. The initial scent is of citrus and spice. After a drink you get the spice up front then a blast of citrus following. The beer doesn't seem as smooth as other whites I have had in the past, but for the price you really can't beat it when found on sale."
"Artificial. That's the word that best describes this beer. I must somewhat preface this by saying that if I knew that it was made by Coors, I wouldn't have purchased it. Anyway, it pours a somewhat strange, yellow-brown color. It looks, well, artificial. Virtually no head at all. The smell is perfumy, if that makes sense. It smells like artificial jasmine/honeysuckle, somewhat like an air-freshener. The taste is sort of like domestic beer with flavor added, and tastes extremely flowery, but, yes - artificial. If there is any somewhat redeeming quality, it has a decent mouthfeel, somewhat peppery and light. It is also somewhat drinkable, because of it's lightness. Don't be fooled by the ""Belgian White Ale"" label. It's domestic swill."
"After I had reluctantly finished the entire glass the bartender poured a second glass of the Blue Moon for me assuming I wanted another. I said ""Thanks but not thanks"" and moved on to another beer."
"I was very impressed with this beer. It has a great taste and is easy to drink. Not too heavy and surely not lite - just right. Try it with an orange slice to add an even better taste. I will be buying this one again for sure. Coors got a winner here!"
"-Oelergud"
"Cloudy orange/amber look. Smells like lemon flowers. Had a citrus, lemon, flower taste. With wheat. Good mouthfeel. Very drinkable, though with the orange slice, I kept thinking the lemon smell was soapy. I really liked this beer for a summer flavor. Would eat the orange slice first, then drink the beer without it. Just have the orange for it's nutrition."
"As to mouthfeel and aftertaste: not much of either. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for what I would consider a summertime quaffer. Save the stouts and porters for autumn - I want something light, refreshing, and inoffensive during the hotter months. This does the trick, giving it high marks for drinkability."
"For all kits faults its still quite quaffable..but if you want an American interpretation of a wheat..try New Belgiums Sunshine Beer"
"Drinkability: A passable summer beer, but for the style, its nowhere near the quality of Celis White or the superb Hoegarden. Far better than most Coors' products, but much better Wits can be had as well."
"Since I was not in Mass, I had a rather poor selection of beer at my local Stop n Shop. The most interesting thing tonight looked like this Blue Moon Belgian White. Since I found out it was from Coors, I wasn't expecting much. I wafted the brew once opened, it was reminiscent of Coors Light, having a very 'macrobrew' stench. It was smoother than other Coors beers (as a white beer should be), but just seemed like a Coors Light clone with a little 'unfiltered' taste mixed in. All in all, I was not too impressed."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a tall white head that fades into a creamy lace. Nose is soft biscuity malts along with some fresh wheat and a bit of a lemon twang. Light in body with a rather strong active carbonation. Taste begins sweet with a touch of candied sugar followed by some yeasty bread dough and the same lemon twang that was present in the aroma. Not a bad beer by any means but also not something Im likely to buy again anytime soon."
"not a bad brew considering coors pumps this one out, but still has work that needs to be done on it. it pours an almost too hazy yellow colour, with a surpisingly small head. the smell is quite faint, with some citrus and spice. average, at best. a moderate wheat flavour is present at first but an over spiced flavour quickly takes over and dominates the rest, including the citrus flavours typical of this style. the proper flavours are here but the balance is way off. this one is relatively easy drinking, but will usually only be found in places where there are better selections available. i remember this one being better pre-coors."
"Overall Impression: Im a wit fan, and while this may be a gateway wit to draw in people to the style, Im afraid it will just tell them a wit is just a beer with some coriander. While this beer isnt too far from style, it just lacks, for lack of a term; soul. It just came across as a bit watery and one sided, and that side was coriander. Coriander is a tough ingredient. Im thinking I got a fairly fresh sample, and if it aged a bit, the coriander would fade a bit. Its also a bit sweet, which draws away from the refreshing aspects I look for with the style, which hurts drinkability. Not a bad beer, but not a really good one either."
"12 ounce bottle, twist off top. Pours a dull soft light brownish orange color, cloudy and just a bit of lacing. Nose is a bit unpleasant, sort of a sharp solventy smell. Head dissolves to a tiny bubble sheen. Notes of yeast,spice, coriander, a hint of soap, cream cycle ice cream pop. So so wit, its so widely available, probably a good beginner beer to turn a newbie on to. I try to avoid Coors products, cuz of their politics...I'll continue to avoid this one in the future"
"Holy cow, what a shocker this was. Picked it up just to review another beer and went back for more. Pours a cloudy honey gold with a froth head that became a monster. The smell is very citrusy, lemons honey with a hop tone. The taste is impressive, could really feel a balance of apricots, lemon and hops that grabbed hold of my taste buds and wouldn't let go. Feels warm and inviting in the mouth. This has become a staple in the fridge and who would have thought from Coors."
"I'd have to call it my favorite Coors product, but what else do they have widely available?"
"It has the look and mouthfeel of a great wit. Now all they need to do is put some taste to go along with the rest to have a damn nice beer. I hope that Coors will keep trying to make a better beer."
"Blue Moon isn't offensive, but that's hardly a recommendation. I will say that it's the best Coors product--and maybe even the best BMC product--that I've had yet."
"White Ale's are my favorite beer, and this is far from the best I've ever had. Goes down smooth enough, but has an odd after taste. I couldn't even finish the six pack, the taste just got worse and worse. Your better off with a Hoegaarden or Sam Adams White for your money."
"This might be a good transition beer for macro-swillers, but it's not that great compared to the style. It's drinkable, but not enjoyable."
"It certainly reminds me of a wit, but it doesn't quite deliver. Thinner, weaker, taste and smell are less profound. Certainly drinkable, and better than the standard fare. Reminds me some of Michelob hefe. Good for what it is, but a rather pale imitation compared to the real thing. Seek out Allagash white, Hoogarden, or Unibroue Blanche De Chambly instead."
"Over all a very drinkable and fairly cheap brew."
"Hard-poured into a pint glass, formed 1/2"" of slightly off-white head over a cloudy honey-hued brew which has floaties (which was my fault, not expecting a Coors product to be unfiltered). Head didn't last very long, and there wasn't much lacing either. Light malty/yeasty aroma, and the taste is pretty much like what I would expect a watered down white from most micros would taste like, very thin in the mouth. Have to give it high marks for drinkability, would certainly go down the hatch on those nice summer days that I wish would find Massachusetts soon."
"Poured out a hazy pale orange color with a little carbonation. Smell consisted of some orange zest with a touch of lemon, but it was quite weak. Taste consists of the same as the smell, but it does start off sweet and finishes with a touch of spice that lasts in the aftertaste. Considering it's from Coors, it's not that bad of an offering from them. A step in the right direction."
"This is a very popular beer these days, as it is the most commonly available example of a Belgian White Beer (the only one you can pick up at the Shell mart). I find that it's a really shoddy example. The head pours kind of sad, and the mouthfeel is a bit harsh for the smoothness expected from this style. The actual flavor is like someone took a Hoegaarden and mixed it half and half with a bland domestic beer. There are much better Belgian White Beers around."
"Had several pints while dining on the town recently. It served as a nice compliment to the red chile fueled New Mexican style dinner I had. This unfiltered wheat was golden in color and it was unfiltered as advertised. Could detect the fruits that are used in this style of beer. Taste was heavy on the wheat with a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel was good, a little heavier than what I thought. It was a nice compliment to dinner, quenching the fire of the chilies."
"I first tried this beer on a break from skiing while in Breckenridge, CO. While I usually avoid macro brews, I have to honestly say that this is the best beer Coors has ever produced. While some may say that this beer is over spiced, I loved the orange/corainder taste of this unique brew. Considering other Belgian whites are 12 bucks a six pack, this is a nice alternative."
"Blue Moon pours out a light orange color with a moderate head that disappears VERY quickly. It smells very citrusy and tastes just like it smells. A very drinkable beer by all means. Goes down extremely smooth with no bitter aftertaste in your mouth at all. Nothing else to say about this beer really. Overall, an average beer that's easy to drink, but is a step up from most of the mass-produced domestic beers."
"When poured the color was of a hazy wheat yellow with medium foam that dissapated quickly. The smell of spices and wheat filled the nose. A pleasant aroma with a hint of citrus. The taste was of a creamy nature with spices and wheat that was pleasant to the palate with no harsh bitterness. I would say that this is the best beer that Coor's had brewed ever!"
"Drinkability: On the right day, I could probably enjoy a few of these. I'm kinda impressed."
"this came to my table in a attractive tall slender glass. hazy orange/sunset with a small tightly bubbled head. one whiff and its citrus up in here. light spices and wheat come around but the lemony aroma is the show. taste wise...slight sweetness, fruity (big lemon/orange), faint spice, all on a light wheaty body. no real hop character, the wheaty malt is what its about. clean and sharp in the mouth, bubbly...finishes dry. quenching! i really like this. i havent had this in bottles yet, but on tap, it was really refreshing and washed down some grub nicely. oh, and yea its brewed by coors...boohoo, get over it nancy."
"BM pours a yellow, veeeery faint orange color and is unfiltered. I'll attribute the relative transparency to a lack of yeast strain, but that's quite ok, because this beer isn't trying to win any awards. It's light and sweet, certainly thinner than an authentic belgian witbier. It really aint bad. I'll pick up a case every summer or so and I know they'll disappear off my shelf like they were in a magic trick. Girls especially love this beer. It's got decent flavor, good citrus flavor with sweet malty yeast, even some generic spice (mostly corriander which gives it the citrus, maybe some clove) and it's easy to throw them back. I have to credit Coors with making this brew. It's decent, tasty, and making them a fortune I'm willing to bet. Find me some numbers about recent increases in sales volume, and then think about bashing them. I'll admit I had this before I had a lot of other micros, so there's something to be said about wide distribution (ahem, SNPA). So, yeah. Give it a shot. And if you can't bring yourself to finish them, I know a bunch of sorority girls who will help you out."
"Easy going down, but overly sweet flavor makes it dificult to drink."
"While not too familiar with this style, I do have to give kudos to Coors for this. Excellent for a macro. It had a nice orange color with some lace. It had a nice fruity smell. It tasted like a wheat beer with orange thrown in. Did my server throw orange in? I don't think so, but I can't tell. I'm torn about what to give it for taste. It was really pleasant, but it was like having a soda. I have the sneaking suspicion this has artificial flavoring in it. Whatever the case, circumstance may dictate how I view the beer. If beer is food, I'm considering this a type of candy."
"I have to give Coors credit: they've made a decent brew here. If I wanted a Belgian white, I'd definitely look elsewhere. However, if I was forced to drink an American macro, this would probably be at the top of my list."
"I have had this beer a few times and until I was about to write this review, I did not know it was made by Coors. I honestly would have never guessed it. This is a good beer. It pours a cloudy light color with very little head. The smell and taste are both quite citrusy, which I liked. It goes down nice and smooth and has a good amount of carbonation. This is a good refreshing summer brew which you can find in a decent amount of places."
"Man I hate reviewing Belgian whites. I know I'm supposed to be rating this bad boy vs. the style, but most whites I've had just sicken me, for some reason. This one, uniquely, doesnt, but I blame that on a lack of flavor. Pours a cloudy golden, not white at all, so I can understand this being a wheat beer but not a white. Smell is potent of that typical wheaty ""white"" smell, unfortunately I dislike that smell quite a bit. Taste is not that complex, just wheaty and simple, and a little bit sickening. What can I say? Those who like these love them, but I just can't do it."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thin white head. The aroma is weak, but has the wit smell to it; fruity yeast and wheat scents. The taste is also a bit tame, but has all the qualities of a wit. It is sweet with pale wheat malts and that wit yeast. It is refreshing and goes down with ease. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This was a decent wit, but fails to reach the level of a true Belgian style."
"It is with a little embarasement that I find this is a Coors product. With that knowledge I now see it so clearly. It tastes exactly like what I would have expected of a Coors Wheat. I have always enjoyed Coors products considerably and find them superior to any of the other U.S. macro-brewers. I now have to remove Herman Josef's premium lager from atop my list."
"Does not compare to a real Belgian."
"As this cost $1.50 more than a sixer of Franziskaner (which I consider much superior), it won't be revisited; but I am surprised it was passable at all."
"Drinkability: I could drink 'em all night long, but I usually have them at the end of the night. I don't know why but I tend to save this beer for last. Maybe it's because it is so flavorful that it wouldn't make sense to start off with it."
"For a wheat beer, this doesn't follow the norm; and I can't figure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Pours into the glass with a healthy golden color. Head basically does not lace. I added a slice of orange before tasting. This helped bring out the 'wheat' flavor, but was unfortunately over powering to any subtleties that might have been in the beer. I'm guessing that any wheat beer that is toppled by a small slice of orange has no subtle notes, but I may retaste this beer in the future sans orange."
"The dullness of colour also cleared with time."
"When I first opened this beer I was really unsure as to what to expect, the beer itself had a very unique aroma a lot of different smells going on at the same time, a hint of fruityness, with some definite spice mixed in. Once poured I was actually surprised by just how light in color this beer was. Without a doubt one of the better light colored beers I have had in quite a while."
"After several sips it deadens all of the right receptors in my head and it begins to seem inviting, on a crude, thirsty, hungry level. Honey is observed wrapping around sun-tosted coriander still on the plant. Asian dishes involving sauteed bean sprouts, bamboo and cilantro are suggested, though never emulated in their naturalness. Iron bitterness closes it out, then explodes, leaving shards of sweetness."
"I love this style so sorry to be so harsh coors, but hey...! The color is a murky mess of an imitation. Aromatics are marketed towards the ""sweet tooth"" American palate. Damn it! Not all of us are sweet toothers!!! The mouthfeel is light and quite carbonated. Flavors are of an oversweetened, overmalted attempt at a belgian wit. Mostly malt dominates the nose and taste, while an infusion of orange and coriander makes a clumbsy appearance. Tastes like a coors silver bullet with a tea bag infusion. It would be a preferred beer to most other coors products for me though, so the drinkability gets rave reviews!"
"Coors?! Says Full Moon Brewing Co. on the bottle, but I'll take the experts word on this."
"So what that it is made by Coors? They still made avery delicious beer in Blue Moon. Pours a rosey gold color that is very intriguing. Has a very light , crisp flavor that has always reminded me of blueberries. Very drinkable beer. For less than many micros/imports you can get a very good 6'er."
"Several years ago this was my backup beer. I could get a six-pack at the Navy comissary for $3.99 so I have a bit of a soft spot for this beer since I could get nothing of this quality for a comparable price."
"I can only be glad of the popularity of this particular beer, for at least these folks are trying something different. It's a pity, though, that so many think that they're actually drinking a product of Belgium, and I hope they move on to better beers."
"Overall - Not much expectation from me because I usually despise anything with the name ""Coors"" on it. However, this was a pleasant beer with a good flavor and good personality. Easily one of the biggest surprises in a beer so far...and it was a pleasant one."
"side note: I'm now a bartender and wonder what the fascination with the orange slice in this beer is. I know it makes it cool but...nevermind."
"Good name for a wit beer; too bad it's not a better example of one. Pours a hazy light golden orange with a big frothy white head. Smells of wheat, slight adjuncts, and a little carroty fruitiness. Where's the lemon zest, coriander, etc.? Tastes much like it smells. Goes down pretty easy and I'd rather have this than many of the standard macro pale lagers."
"this is a great summer beer."
"I'm completely shcoked that a beer this decent could be made by a mega-brewer. If it's the best looking option on tap I'd go with it again."
"an active, bubbly head flares up and dies fast, it was white. the beer is a semi cloudy orange with little activity as far as bubbles commin up. there was nothing in the way of sediment in the bottle. a slight scent, nothing much here, a bit unfocused. fruit of strawberry, zest of lemon and orange, next to no malt or wheat in the scent and a scant bit of spice but it smells pretty lame altogether to me. the flavor lacks a definate wheat there is some wheat like body but the flavor just dosen't have much in the way of wheat or for that matter, much of a malt. the spice in this beer was all alone, stranded and out of balance. corriander was what i thought i noted but all the same it was a vegetable type flavor with the spice. also notable was an aftertaste from hell. it was similar to the feeling of having just drank cokeacola, it tasted fabricated. the mouthfeel was ok i suppose, bubbly and forgivably watery. i didn't like this beer but if i did it would be drinkable, i've seen alot of girls and even a few people with a palate drink this but i don't think i ever will again. i'd take a high life first (i'd also take a hoegaarden first) and only stranded on an island. sorry, i just didn't like it."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and the beer is fairly drinkable. This is the best offering from Coors and is even better on tap. Still falls behind the Point White Beer from Stevens Point Brewery."
"A solid macro offering. I finally succumbed and ordered one on tap. Nice cloudy yellow, with a lacey head. Tasted a bit off, not a Belgium taste I'm used to, but good never the less. Citris and a pugent hops taste. A good choice in a macro enviorment."
"ng"
"Overall, not a bad beer especially from Coors."
"This beer pours a yellow color with a little wheat hazy. It has a slight head that died quickly. Smells of fruit and lemons. The first sip of this you can really notice the Lemon flavor that is just to overpowering for my taste. Wheat beers are one of my favorite styles of beers but this one was too fruity for my liking. I would consider this beer drinkable but not the best beer of this style. Taking into consideration that this beer is from Coors and the fact that I could drink this if I was at a bar and they only had macros and nothing else it is not that bad."
"This Whitbier pours a bit more orange hue to it than the normal golden or bright yellow color that seems to be the norm for this type of brew. There is a thick head present after the pour but quickly reduces to nothing in a blink of an eye. The aroma is a bit malt and yeast and citrus with hints of spices mixed in. It seems to be more of an orange citrus aroma than a lemon, interesting. The taste begins with a sweet malt start; a slight mixture of spices jump in and then again, more of an orange flavor then a lemon. It is finished of slightly bitter yeast taste. Overall, This beer is very drinkable and goes down smooth. Coors eh?"
"Update - It's been seven years since my initial review so thought I'd give this one another go as a few people in the office have been talking about it. The coriander really does overkill everything else at the nose and although I wouldn't say that it overwhelmed the taste it certainly is the dominant flavor. The carbs are there but it's overly flat but I was able to get most of it down this time so bumped the rating a bit."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy yellow color with one finger of head. There is almost no lacing left on the glass. The smell is a tad bit spicy, a little fruity. The taste is malty and has lots of orange and lemon taste. There is a bit of spice, maybe coriander also. The mouthfeel is just average, a little thin. The drinkability is fair also. I didn't think they could do it, but Coors has made a decent beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow color with a medium head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma smells strongly of citrus and wheat with hints of spices. The flavor is sweet and wheaty with some citrus notes. The spices are also present in the taste, but not too much. This is a pretty enjoyable beer off the tap, but not quite as great out of the bottle."
"This beer poured out a hazy and very pale straw yellow color. The thin foamy head faded quick and left nothing. Highly carbonated without anything really discernable in the aroma except for a slight sour yeastiness. The flavor is light and overall pretty bland. Some sweet and sour wheat malt flavor. Very light and really not a bad offering from a big brewer. I like this beer. A Belgium White that isnt In your face, but is quite drinkable."
"Light amber color. Large head. Aroma is malty and a touch spicy. A medium bodied white. Malts are sweet. Hops are a touch spicy. Smooth taste. Mild flavors. Not what I think of when drinking a Belgian White, but tasty enough. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Almost the color of orange juice in appearance with a fluffy white head that retreats after a few minutes. Light aroma of wheat and I could barely detect any spices. Mouthfeel is thin with some crispness on the edges. Taste leans toward the sweet side with some wheat flavor in addition to a touch of citrus (orange). Lacks the overall flavoring of coriander, orange peel and spice along with the crispness that a good wit should have. With other better options like Lakefront White and Allagash White, in addition to others Blue Moon is something I probably won't choose again."
"Head stayed around longer than expected.Had a bubbling carbonation.Cloudy gold in color.Sweet wheat taste that is very smooth and creamy.Banana is smelled and tasted along with some spices.I find these highly drinkable and great with meals.Belgian White is my favorite beer style and I find myself going back to Blue Moon's because of the quality and availability.Balanced very well with a crispness to the mouth but also a smoothness.Faint bitterness with no real hop character.Dry finish with an aftertaste that doesnt stick around.I never knew Coors brewed this until reading a few of these reviews.Why don't they put the same effort into their other beer?"
"to try this as a draft as well."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured a large off-white head with fine-small sized bubbles that was long lasting. The body was cloudy and carbonation was observed. The hue of this beer was pale yellow and the nose was cruity and citrusy. There was good lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer. The flavor was mild and it lacked character. The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and watery."
"Even though Coors, inc makes Blue Moon this is still not a bad beer. It's a good beer to have people transition from macro to micro. Pretty sweet tasting. A lot of coriander and citrus in there. The base of the flavor is a wheaty malt taste. Not real balanced or deep. However, the more I experience other beers the more I realize that this simply is a weak, cloying beer. But it's not too bad for getting someone started into non-light beers."
"This is currently my every day beer. It's that good. The spice, combined with what I can only describe as a hint of blueberry, makes this so deliciously drinkable I had to bring some back to Toronto on my last trip home, south of the border. Blueberry isn't mentioned on the label and friends say they don't always taste it - some batches seem to have it and some don't - but whatever the flavour is it's matched perfectly with the spices of this Belgian Wheat."
"Nice hazy color, no head, light crown of bubbles. Aroma is, well, mostly orange, some yeast in the background. Tastes wonderfully spicy and fruity, orange up front, turning slightly tart/sour towards the end. Bottom of the glass tastes more of lemon. Mouthfeel is a little heavier for a Wit than I would have expected, but not bad. Though I would generally drink this style in the summer, I actually think I would prefer this in a cooler environment where it's bigger body would be a better fit. However, on any given summer's day, I'd be good for one. Coor's best offering, IMO."
"A good contender in the wit word, this cloudy yellow brew with moderate white head has its' own unique flavors. Prominent flavors of citrus, malt, and some spice along with strong coriander, I think. A strong lingering herb/spice remains after a bathing of the palate and swallowing. A soft and smooth mouthfeel with a tart finish. I was surprised at its' unique qualities and think it's a positive addition to the variety of whites."
"i was surprised to find that this was brewed by coors. Real cloudy yellow appearance, not much of a head could have been a bad pour though. i dind't notice much of a smell at all. the beer itself wasn't too bad. the lemon flavor really hit me right away. there was a peppery taste as i was rolling it around in my mouth a bit. eh... not bad. it'd probably be good on a hot summer day, seems like it would be refreshing. i feel like this would be good to marinate chicken in or something..."
"I remember when I was 14 I stole a Blue Moon from my dad, I think that this may have been the first craft beer that I ever drank, so I have to ""cheers"" to that. Poured a whitish-yellowish-orange, very cloudy with visible particles of sediment and a low-retention head. The smell was good, with a banana citrus thing definetely happening. The taste is also very enjoyable - nice an light, great for summer, and going well with a slice of lemon. The presentation could use some work ( better head, finer sediment), but a good beer nonetheless."
"The smell is a little grainsy, a little tart, with some peas. The beer starts a touch fruity, with some herbs and noticeable pepper. The middle is a bit sour and strangely oily. The finish is decently bitter, but not altogether pleasant. This is an ok beer. Drinkable, but too much peas."
"A hazy orange body is topped by a good-sized creamy white head that drops shortly but maintains a thin surface covering and leaves nice sheets of temporal lace with each sip. The bouquet is interestingly floral. Orange peel is obvious in the nose, but appears more softly lemony than orangeish. There's a very mild touch of soft coriander as well, and some gentle yeastiness. The body is medium although it appears slightly fuller due to it's smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Just as the spice is obvious in the nose, so it is in the flavor with gentle coriander and mild orange peel wrapped in lush, sweet malt. Throughout the glass the dull yeastiness develops on the palate, and some additional peppery spiciness evolves. Not a bad beer at all! It seems a bit fluffy (maybe I should say obtuse?) in comparison to most of the versions I've had from Belgium, but it's not overly done. It's flavorful, just lacking in complexity. There are better domestically brewed witbier's available, but this will do nicely in a pinch."
"A good beer with a light feel to it. The smell is fruity in its aroma. Very nice pour with a light white head. The taste has a bit more fruity flavor then I am used to but it was smooth. The aftertaste is a bit metallic but not too bad. Not a bad beer overall for its style"
"Pours a pale yellow/light golden. Appears cloudy, a thin white head dissipates rather quickly to nothing more than a veneer of small bubbles. A good looking beer. A moderately strong floral/fruity aroma, provides an inviting scent. A very mild taste for its style, slightly fruity, not overpowering in anyway. A definite aftertaste persists although this is neither positive or negative. Feels light, an easy drinking beer, although somewhat disappointing given both its very good appearance and smell. I will drink it again, although will not go out of my way to find it."
"I find this beer to be quite drinkable and is often the best beer on tap at restaurants that mostly serve macro's. I also remember what it was like before Coors bought Blue Moon and find the current version not as tasty as it once was."
"This is the best beer Coors makes that I've had. Solid, but nothing exceptional."
"I drank the first one, after fishing the damn orange out of it. I’ll review the second one. Alrighty then, it’s a bad wheat beer, that being said, I’m a big fan of wheat beers, and thus it did tend to hit the spot. Cloudy wheat beer, but missing that banana aroma and taste that is typical with the style. Again it went down well, but my lord there are tons better."
"Not a great example of a Belgian White. Head dissapears quickly and tastes a little thin for a wheat. Not a heck of alot of flavor to it either, but it washes down pizza rather well. This style should have some decent spice presence to it and is lacking big time. I'll stick with the Allagash White from now on."
" Blue moon is really good with Mussels steamed in it with garlic and butter.A bag of chips on the side and maybe some pickeled hop shoots."
"This beer is a fairly cloudy orange color. Not much of a head to notice. It tastes similar to other wheat beers, a little softer than some though. I didnt like it is much this time as i remembered liking it before, but it still is pretty tasty. Nothing amazing however."
"This was my first experience of a belgian wit so I decided to revisit this beer. I enjoyed befor because I've never had anything like it before, but now after having other belgian wits, this was very dissappointing. It has a cloudy orange color with a nice white head, but I expected the pale golden color that is characteristic of most wits. This looked more like dirty water. It was served with a lemon which in fact helped the aroma. The taste was slightly citrusy, but not enough to make this a refreshing summer beer. I only enjoyed this years ago because it was different (for me), so it looks like Coor's had a good idea. If Hoegaarden and allegash white were as widely available as this though, I don't think this would sell very well."
"This is a decent beer that really seems in place this time of the year. The color is a cloudy amber orange, rather on the light side. The aroma was a bit light but scented of fruity citrus and a hint of grain. Mostly citrus on the taste with some mixed hops sense. Overall a fairly enjoyable beer."
"Well, I am not going to give this a rating based on the if you look at who brews it then it's pretty good. I don't care who manufactured this beer, I am convinced after having in the bottle, CO2 pressured keg, and good old keg party tap. If you look at this one in the glass it pours a cloudy orangish gold hue with a creamy carrot tinted head that is rather pleasant in appearance and taste. It's aroma is primarily coriander (orange peel), but the wheat based goodness also comes alive with every inhalation. The taste is a sweet version of a classic style that a mass production company acually put some care into to bring out a decent white beer. For that reason I have respect for this beer, definitely something I would always give a tasting to. Very drinkable this is a great beer that I will enjoy again and again."
"I know this made by a Coors establishment, but I gotta say, I enjoy this beer. Usually, I have it draught from a local restaurant near our house, it cools the mouth nicely with the spicy New Mexican fare. I think it is a normal looking beer with it's light haze giving it the allure of a hefe. I find the smell a little akin to that of fake scented oranges, which is a little disconcerting. However, the flavor of the beer wins points back quickly. Granted, it is not highly complex, I enjoy the citrus undertones of this beer, especially with a slice of orange in tossed in the brew (yeah I know, but I like cream in my coffee too). It drinks smoothly and nicely, with an aftertaste of oranges. I can easily drink a few with the red chile sauce that is setting my tongue on fire."
"Color is a cloudy, pale golden yellow with lots of white foamy head about a finger high. Smells alot like most hefe/wits, very lemony, citrusy orange, yeasty, with some spices. Taste is good, pretty straight up citrusy lemon and orange, a bit of spicyness and honey. Feel is light and smooth with an overall gritty pulp grain feel with a citrusy tang. Its a pretty decent offering for an Americanized belgian wit."
"Now how some BAs are not big on holiday spice brews, I guess im just not big on unfiltered wits. For me, I sip it to get threw it, the style. Thisone was smooth & easy for this style to get through, even if myself not a repurchase product. The appearance was nice, from its cool looking label to its hazy apricot color with a light ivory head. The aroma, not so appealing. Kinda sour on the nose. The taste is of light orange spice, tart but yet left sweet as the mouthfeel is left doughy. Again im not the ""go to guy"" for this style."
"93% perspiration, 6% electricity, 4% evaporation, and 2% butterscotch ripple. Slugworth would be proud."
"Tasted: 06/02/04"
"Poured a hazy light orange-yellow -- something like a field of wheat at sunset and from afar. Almost no head which probably didn't help the fairly anemic aroma. It tastes fine -- just not 100% up to par with the style. There are but minor hints of lemon zest and perhaps coriander. But that exceedingly spiced citrus note just isn't there. I think perhaps more wheat than citrus? Anyhow, it goes down very easily, and it's by no means terrible. I've had it many times before, and I'm sure I'll have it again."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: If you're a fan of wheat beers than this one is worth checking out. I'm still shocked this one comes from Coors Brewing Company. They've managed to create a beer that is refreshing and pleasant."
"No sir, I don't like it. I tried a bottle before knowing it was a Coors product or that would have scared me off. It is much lighter than beers that I normally consume. Perhaps this disqualifies my review because I lack the experience, but this is the type of beer that I started to move away from when I became more interested in beer. Better than standard macroswill, but not much."
"Starts off nice, with a hazy golden color and decent head. Aroma is typical of belgian wit - sweet and spicy. Flavor was too strong on the spice for me, not enough of the sweet & sour characteristics I like in this style. Seems like they tried to duplicate Hoegaarden (which I like), but went way overboard on the spices."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a white hea. Tastes like a lighter belgian beer, clove/banana spicy flavors, yet not at the intensity of a real belgian beer. This is a great gateway beer. It may be a spawn of a macro. But I like it."
"I can't wait to try my next Belgian-style beer, but for now the SwillQuest continues (for an explanation of SwillQuest, beermail me). For some reason, I feel this beer would go well with Italian food, but that's just me. Overall, the best beer made by one of the Big 3."
"I know that everyone has already said this but, it is brewed by Coors? I had no idea. My girlfriend and her friends like this beer and I saw one sitting in the fridge so I tried. Pours a cloudy dark yellow color with a very little head. The aroma was a bit sour with some lemon coming through. The taste was more sweet than I prefer with a bit of corriandor and yeast flavors coming through. Not a great beer, just average."
"Pours a cloudy/pale colour with a nice white head that settles down quickly. Average carbonation with nice taste and smell. Average Belgium Wheat Style but i have to give it to them for the name. I mean there could be a Hard Rock song made out of this name"
"My girlfriend's favorite brew. Better with a lemon in the glass. Cloudy golden color and light head and lace. Flavor has elements of citrus, nutmeg, yeast. I am no fan of Macro's but say what you want, this is a good beer. By no means is this the best Wit out there, or even in the upper escleon, but is not the worst either. I would actually like to try their pumpkin if I could ever find it."
"This is one of those beers that you need to be in the mood for. Sometimes I drink this and it's absolutely refreshing and delicious. Other times, it's medicinal, watery, and repulsive. I'm drinking one right now and it's pretty damn good. Very smooth and refreshing, with a delicious aftertaste that reminds me of pumpkin pie (whatever spice is used in pumpkin pie is probably what I'm tasting). I think it's nutmeg or clove. At any rate, this is a fantastic refresher for a hot day. Forget the fact that it's brewed by Coors, this beer stands on its own."
"Pour a cloudy straw color with a white head that leaves rather quickly.  smell of citrus ring through my pallet.  A strong carbonation stings the mouth.  This is a nice belgium white that my wife really loves."
"A pretty great beer, and it is brewed by COORS! Who would have thunk it!?!? This belgian style white ale pours a cloudy golden/orange colour and has a very nice zesty lemon aroma. This tasted very good, but it is not the best example of this stlye. Still it has a nice light mouth feel and a very zesty flavour, like a white ale or hefe-weizen should, and it is a quite drinkable brew"
"Like others I too was surprised to find out that Coors made this beer.  Not a bad beer considering.  Has a slight cloudy color to it, not a great head, but there was a small one.  It left a light lace on the side of the glass as well.  The flavor was not quite what I was used to for a Belgian White, but a pretty good attemp for a large brewery.  It had a slight hint of citrus to it as well.  Drinkable.  Just get by the Coors name on it."
"Was surprised to see this is a Coors product.  While not quite the same as most belgian beers I have had, it is not bad coming from a major beer producer.  I would be happy to see this beer more widely available if for no other reason to have a decent beer available more often.  It has a nice yellow color with a hint of orange, and a somewhat creamy head.  The aromas are somewhat fruity, like citrus and a hint of banana.  The taste is rather clean with a slightly creamy mouthfeel.  While I think my buddy was expecting more from a belgium white style beer, it is not a bad beer at all.  Definitely refreshing, it is a good warm weather beer, and would make a good compromise between truly good beer and the macro stuff.   Very easy to drink a few of these."
"The beer pours a light ""Chill Hazed"" golden color with a modest in size white head that is semi-creamy in texture and as it dissipates quickly the leftover lace forms a quite thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp and the start also sweet with a fair grain presence, the top is cadaverous. Finish is moderately carbonated with meek hop spiciness and a dry lingering aftertaste."
"Nice cloudy pour, decent head. As it warmed up, the citrusy flavors came out a little more but it was never overpowering. Not my favorite style but decent."
"The taste is a bit artificial at times and that can limit the number of them you'd drink in one setting. My ranking on this beer has dropped as I have found better versions of this style but it is a good specimen to introduce a leery drinker."
"I couldn't drink more than one of these at a sitting.   Might serves as an introduction to the witbier style...but it would likely scare more people away than it would attract."
"Hazy cloudy appearance with litte head that disappears very quickly. Coriander and citrus taste with a slight peppercorn that comes in later. An ok beer for this style."
"This is not a bad beer, but not outstanding.  Cloudy golden, slight citrus nose and taste.  Very little hops.  A refreshing summer beer, that would probably be a very good choice to give a macro drinker to expand his or her horizons."
"I've had this beer before and from what I remembered it was not that good. Since seeing several favorable reviews I thought it merited another try. What I found was that it was actually worse than I remembered. I noticed some weird kind of vegetal smell, kind of like that bunch of parsley you forgot was in the bottom of the veggie drawer in the fridge, and now it's funky ass parsley soup. Sour veggie taste too. Yuk. I promptly dumped this crap into the drain."
"Cloudy, hazy straw-like color with a thin, short-lived head.  Light carbonation.  The beer has a thin citrus aroma.  Light taste.  Nothing outstanding, but not a flawed beer either.  I think  its somewhat boring for the style."
"Hazy straw color.  A little spicing on the nose.  Not much though.  This is really a sweet wit.  Light bodied and easy drinking.  Spicing is pretty evident on the palate.  Nutmeg, cinamon, bitter orange.  Very nice.  This was on of the first craft brews that really caught my attention some 8,10 years ago.  It is still a very enjoyable brew."
"I liked this one very much. It was one beer I can truly say that an air freshener should be made from the scent. The color was also very appealing to me, a cloudy yellow/amber. Very nice. Extremely smooth, with a very unique complexity unlike any other wheat I have had. I could drink many of these on a warm summer night. I let the yeast settle in the bottle, then swirled and dumped. The yeasty flavor in the glass gave it an excellent spiciness. An excellent brew!!"
"Cloudy and pale, this beer poured nicely into the glass.  You could definetely see the yeast suspended toward the end of the pour.  A lemony, yeasty aroma cleary present.   Very smooth tasting, bready with citrus flavor sneaking its way in.  A little thin for me, but I think this is what the style is.  Refreshing and made for hot summer days.  A good beer to keep around once in a while- especailly for people with whom you want introduce to different styles of beer."
"this was an interesting brew. it had a mouthfeel that was truly unique. it kind of fizzled. it was smooth and a little sweet and wheaty. i liked this one, and i will add some more when i figure out exactly what is going on with this strange brew"
"This beer was a cloudy straw color, which formed little head and left a little lace, but not much.  It had a citrus, hops aroma.  A definate citrus taste with some hops.  Not as good as other beers of this style, but for a summer beer, better than getting some other macros off the tap."
"Ther only thing that I foind worth hanging my hat on for this beer is the appearance.  It is relatively murky and cloudy.  The aroma is a little weak when it comes to a Belgian.  The flavor of this beer offers little to get excited about, although it does have some hints of spice and fruit.  Worth a try, but do not try too hard."
"Wow! Silky smooth flavor and a great aroma and aftertaste. Citrusy flavor and pours a hazy yellow-orange. This beer is becoming easier to find since being bought by Coors, and so far there has not been a noticeable drop in quality."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-peach color, with a solid white head. Aroma of orange peels and coriander on the nose. The same is found on the palate orange notes and coriander, smooth and refreshing. Wasnt expecting much, this brew wasnt bad at allnot to shabby"
"As with all Belgian Witbiers, Blue Moon's has a bright hazy yellow color. Another distinctive characteristic typical of Witbier is the spicy-orange aroma and definite coriander flavor all the way through to the finish.  Coors did an excellent job with this brew.  << THIS IS CALLED BELGIAN WHITE NOT BELGIUM WHITE >>"
"Big yellow straw color. It had a nice white fluffy head for about 10 seconds. Heavy citrus smell, I noticed alot of lemon, but it was appealing. (No need to add a lemon, please.) The taste was close to a belgian wit, but lacked the yeasty flavor I really like. Yes, a bit too watery and a little sweet.  Easy to drink, a nice introduction beer to macro drinking friends. Not nearly as tasty as the Allagash White. The bottle I had was actully better than one I had on tap a few months ago. I know Coors takes a bashing here, but this a decent beer. Give them credit for trying, but it's easy to understand this product, sweet and easy to drink."
"A good beer to bring to parties, seems to be the cool or fashionable beer to have around for some people that still think micro brew is a fad. Everyone that buys this beer that I know did not even have a clue that it was a Coors product."
"The hazy straw hue is typical for a Belgian wit, but the head is sorely lacking.  Mild cilantro, citrus and light candi sugar in aroma, but estery contributions from the yeast are unfortunately a bit too mild. The high carbonation and light body are a bit a bit of a disapointment. The wheat and oat proteins are too light and don't add enough to the body and mouthfeel. The spices dominate the flavor and are followed by sugary sweetness.  Blue Moon finishes quite sweet, almost cloyingly so.  This brew lacks the complexity of a real Belgian wit and is too sweet for my tastes.  Isn't this owned by Coors?"
"Not quite Hoegaarden but certainly a good beer. Not quite as aggressive as Hoegaarden but the spice comes through well. Color and smell are key again."
"Pours a cloudy, bright orangey gold with a head that shrinks but lasts all the way down the glass.  Smell is faint citric (lemon).  The flavor is of light citrusy lemon and almost imperceptible coriander.  The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the brew is very drinkable.  I know this beer takes a lot of bashing here but I like it.  I relate it to something like the Sam Adams Weiss.  It isn't really right for the attampted style but it is a better than average tasting, highly drinkable brew.  I find it is great for warm weather session drinking."
"I'll probably be coming back and re-rating this beer since I tried it after a having about 4 pints of stouts and porters and a full meal. I was a bit full and the spices were just two much. I tried to get it down, but after about four sips, it went to my friend."
"It's so hard for me to diss any beer at all but this one misses the mark by quite a way. The appearance is misleading. It LOOKS like a real Belgian white, cloudy wheat but perhaps a shade dark. The flavor was awful. It's very rare that I will not finish a beer. This one made it into that lonely zone. Stick to Celis or Hoegaarden."
"Coors seems to have matched the style well on some points. Its lightly hoppy and crisp to a point. Weak bits of wheaty esters, slightly stifling with cotton candy effects. Its hazy, too...I'll agree with proc that the aftertaste is long lasting but I don't find it citrusy as much as vaguely medicinal, spices may correspond with the usual coriander as well as others."
"I have to give credit where credit is due.  Coors does a nice job with this beer.  The fact that they are a big brewer does not mean they can't produce a good beer.  Blue Moon Belgium White pours out nice and somewhat semi-cloudy.  The fact that its not completely filtered, lends to its taste.  I never had the pleasure of trying Celis White, so a comparison cannot be made from my end, but the citrusy aftertaste of this one stays with you for awhile.  Nice job on the part of Coors, and believe me, its tough for me to say that."
"very cloudy, deep golden in color with a slightly spicy/lemony aroma. moderate body, soft and creamy with a slightly wheat twang. goes down smooth and leaves a refreshing aftertaste that lingers. i imagine a six pack of these would go down quick on a hot summer day."
"I like this one! Only beaten by Sam Adams White Ale (what ever happened to that?) Well made, great cloudy appearance...good stuff, but still no Celis White (which I miss dearly)"
"I will have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer the first time I tried it. Well moderated sweetness and rather fresh spices. For someone who hasn't sampled many witbiers, this is certainly a good starter version. While I'm no more a fan of Coors than the average bear, at least they have put out something other than a bland fizzy beer which will, hopefully, lead at least a few folks to explore further."
