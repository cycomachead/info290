"OVERALL:  this is a good Belgian witbier but nothing special, I would recommend to anyone who likes the style, solid but not spectacular."

"Overall, one of my favorite beers from Boulevard. I know it's not a crowd favorite, but it's one of the earliest craft beers I remember as being a game-changer for my perspective on craft beer. Finally reviewing it after all these years in order to encourage others- to give it a go."

"O - A tasty take on the Belgian wit. Definitely a great summertime brew. Worth checking out, and buying again"

"Zon pours a bright cloudy golden color with a small non lacing head. There is a citrus like aroma with a lot of yeasty notes. The taste is full of citrus, mainly lemon notes, lots of yeasty like flavors, and good Belgian candy notes, good wheat like backbone. Drinkable, good body, and drinkable. Overall a nice drinkable and refreshing witbier."
""
"Overall: a very easy to drink witbier. Refreshing and hits the spot on a warm day."

"Sampled on 9/7/13. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler and served in a pilsner glass.. Pours a hazy orange/yellow with a small white head. Some lacing is seen. Average carbonation but not overly done. The aroma is of mostly grains, wheat and coriander. The coriander really is the first thing you taste with a hint of citrus with a slight 'hoppy' aftertaste."
""
""
"An overall satisfying summer ale. Nothing mind-boggling, no new trends established. Just a solid, tasty witbier, very suitable for the dog days of summer..."
""
""
""
"O Good Summertimer. Nothing stands out. Might be a little rich for really hot days, relatively speaking. It's good, not great."

"Pours very cloudy with very little head. Could easily be mistaken for a mixture of orange and apple juice. Aroma is citrus with a nice kick of spices. Taste also citrus and spice, along with banana. Mouthfeel is medium-light. Overall very light and refreshing, a perfect summer beer."

"overall kind of boring, but easy to drink. was expecting a bit more."
"decent but overpriced for what it is. their pale wheat beer is much better"

"Trying the ZON for the first time in awhile. I found this in the reduced price bin at Binny's. The beer pours a pee cloudy yellow with almost no head and no lace. The scent carries wisps of spice and lemon citrus. The taste follows the scent fairly closely. Some decent bitterness with good balanced sweet belgium style malt. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall its OK....good fro warmer summer months."

"Summary - Not very good overall. It's really not much of a beer. It's too light and flavorless to be a Witbier. I'm not getting this one again. Glad I didn't get a 6-pack."

"O: I really enjoyed this boulevard selection, will drink again."
""

"O: Solid beer. It's a good wheat beer and would be perfect on hot summer days. The flavors are nice, but nothing about this beer really stands out. I would have liked a bit more clove punch and maybe some stronger banana esters. But overall, I dig it. I'd drink it again if it was around, but I don't see myself buying a whole lot of it."
""
"O-An easy drinking summer beer, it smells great but the rest of the beer doesn't hold up."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O - just not very good all-around"
"O: This beer is very easy to drink, refreshing and thirst-quenching. I would have no problem drinking several of these back-to-back on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, easy to drink, and very sessionable. A very nice beer for the summer."
""

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a pale opaque yellow; no head nor lacing. Aroma of light wheat, Belgian yeast and citrus. Flavor is pleasant slightly sweet wheat,tangy light coriander and citrus. Light bodied. A decent low ABV wit. Will try again."

"O- Another solid seasonal from Boulevard. Keep them coming."
""
"A wonderful example of the witbier style and the first one I've really loved. Something easy that I could drink anyday."
""
""
"Overall – I really enjoyed this beer, shockingly so. I did not expect a witbier to impress me so much, so I may need to research this style a little more (read: drink a lot). The nose and palate complexity was nice, easily drinkable, 4.4% you could session this one easily. The most surprising part about the whole deal was that the misses asked if I could get a six pack the next time I was out. She generally hates beer, and especially the porters and stouts that I like, but she enjoyed this. Kudos to Boulevard. I would highly recommend it, and I would drink and buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I understand it, this is only a seasonal beer - summer, of course - and boy what a session beer for a hot humid American summer day! I could see being at an all day 4th of July picnic knocking down a six-pack (or two, if not driving!) with no problem. I just wish it were sold outside of Missouri and its bordering states."

"pretty neat little belgian ale here. very summer. pours a hazy small headed hay color with a nose of belgian yeast, wheat malt, and citrus. sort of pollenated feeling flavor, yeasty and bright, orange and spice. mouthfeel is nice too, pleanty of bubbles and a moderate mody, this side of medium. cloudy mashy finish lends well to the experience. nice beer, more suited to july than january, but a nice brew"

"O: Not a fan! I was excited to try this since I loved the Two Jokers, but odiously this one has it's flaws. I will try a fresh bottle next time to get a fair evaluation."

"Pours cloudy golden yellow. Good haze. Light foam. Nose is wheat, slight citrus. Taste is a subtle tart, lemonym banked by a clean wheat. Easy finish. Light carbonation - smooth and balanced. Good summer beer for sure."
""
""
"Fuller bodied than expected with a nice crisp, spicy bite that lingers over the sweetness into a slight dry finish. Lots of zesty spice with hints of pepper, clove and lemon zest which is countered mid-palate by the bready yeast, citrus fruit and banana. The yeast adds fullness to the palate and along with the sweetener notes provides flavorful balance. Complex, flavorful and very easy to drink, especially in warmer weather."

"Overall: Not a bad brew, but there are better Wits out there. I bought the Boulevard sampler pack and this was actually one of the better ones from the overall weak pack."
"Overall: Great summer choice but then again this beer is representative of the ""Sun."""
"D: This beer goes down extremely easily.  This isn't one of my favorite styles, but it is a very easily approachable one.  Tasty, slightly complex, and well balanced.  Pretty solid beer from a very solid brewery. "
"O: this brew is kind of blah, some good flavors in there but they don't balance with each other"
"Would drink this again on a hot day but will never go looking for it."
"A pretty standard affair Belgian Wit, the flavors are all good but seem a bit lacking overall and the carbonation is a bit thin."
"Overall Impression- Such a nice refreshing Witbier! Awesome taste and mouthfeel! I enjoy seeing this spice and peppery feel in this one with good citrus tastes. Will be looking for again! My first time enjoying and am a huge fan."
"D/O: Full of delicious and style-appropriate flavor, this seasonal wit from Boulevard came as a pleasant and unexpected surprise. With no new moves to display, it is instead like an old friend that has returned after too long. It is capable of reminding even a jaded beer enthusiast of what they used to like about the style, before they moved on to more extreme terrain. Simply a delight."
"Overall: this beer has some flavor flaws but other than that is pretty decent. I'd give it another try if I saw it around."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with no head and no lacing. Aroma of coriander upfront with some citrus in the back. Taste follows the nose. Very pure and true to the style wit beer. Not the beat but really damn good. I like this a hell of a lot better than hoegarden. Smooth and easy drinking. I like it."
"Back to workin' my way through the Boulevard variety pack. This bit pours a cloudy pale straw topped by a finger of bright white foam. The nose comprises wheat, coriander, black pepper, salt, Belgian yeast, lemon zest, white bread, and a small current of sweet caramel waaayyy in the back. The taste doesn't change too much up, though the lemon comes through stronger and the salt is amped heavily. I wouldn't necessarily call the result ""salty", but it's far from ""not at all salty"". The body is a hefty light, with a light carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, an okay wit, but the saltiness is not too becoming. beyond that, though, it ain't too bad..."
"Overall this is a solid beer. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but a great seasonal offering that is definitely well crafted."
"O - overall a tasty beer. Nice fruity taste and medium body that makes a very enjoyable brew."
"My only regret is that I bought on 2 bottles of Zon in my mix and match 6 pack, and my wife has already drank the other bottle."
"Notes: One of the best Witbiers I've had. Just when I was ready to give up on American wheat beers, this guy comes along."
"O: A good witbier. I like Motership Wit a bit better, but this is right behind. Well balanced and doesn't knock you over with carbonation or spice at the finish."
"The liquid pours a hazy pale yellow color with a thick foamy white head that left a lot of lacing. It smells of banana clove wheat belgian yeast and hay. The taste is very similar but also has some bubblegum flavor as well. It is very soft and light with lots of simooth carbonation. This is a very easy drinking and flavorful wit, I wish the abv was a little higher though."
"Overall, an easy drinking wit. Decent flavor. Definitely enjoyable in the summer months."
"Trying this back to back with their Unfiltered Wheat and what a difference some coriander makes! Pretty strong on those notes, light and pretty drinkable. Another good wheat style beer from Boulevard although I personally would prefer the standard offering."
"Overall a very enjoyable brew, very refreshing on a hot summer day, low abv makes it very drinkable"
"Good beer for the summer still prefer their smokestack line of beer."
"This is a decent beer. The problem is that the coriander overwhelms many of the other flavors, causing the beer to be out of balance. It is refreshing, however, and very sessionable."
"Overall- Well it smells quite pleasant. Though unfortunately the rest of the aspects don’t quite stack up. And it is a fairly watery. I will have no problem drinking my other bottle, but my affair with it will end there."
"O- this is a pretty weak beer overall. not something i can see myself seeking out again. the one thing it has going for it is the weak strength, but there are more flavorful beers out there with the same ABV"
"Overall, not too shabby. I'll be down in MO next week on vacation, and I'll probably grab a sixer while I'm there."
"Has the light body you'd expect, feels almost fluffy. Somewhat watered down from what I was looking for. Comes off quite light across the palate. A nice summer beer. Drinkability is high. A good seasonal that hits the spot in the warmer months without a doubt. Prosit!"
"PRETTY GOOD, STILL NOT MUST HAVE!"
"This is a solid, above-average witbier. Nothing more, nothing less. An excellent hot weather beer."
"D: easy to drink; light flavors and crisp feel make it refreshing and easy to down"
"D: High drinkability. Good aftertaste, light and refreshing overall."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: A good start to my Sunday (let's go Ravens!). It's no Smokestack but it'll do in a pinch."
"D - I am not a big fan of this style, but the appearance and smell really had me excited to try it. However, the taste did not have any real definition to it and the carbonation level started to be annoying as I drank it. But like I always say, try it for yourself."
"It does taste a little bit old, unfiltered wheats don't taste the best if consumed after their best by dates but this is a fine beer even out of date, definitely recommend"
"not too bad overall. taste should be 3.8 and drinkability 3.5, but compensated the scores to reflect that."
"Overall a nice light wit. Not the best wit but it would hit the spot on a hot day."
"One of the better blvd flagships I've had."
"easily drinkable, low alcohol content, this is a very easy drinker for warm night. Will buy again, good stuff."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer. It is tasty and did the job i wanted it to do. Got it in the variety pack...probably wouldn't actively seek it out, but it that's no indication that i wouldn't drink it again."
"D= I liked this beer, but found myself tiring of it by the end of the glass. Could have just been me at that particular point in time moreso than the beer. I would definitely drink this again."
"Overall, a solid wit and true to the style. Fruity and refreshing. If you are in the mood for a full-flavored wit, this is definetly one to try."
"Overall: Refreshing, but some missing elements that would make it a really good beer (e.g. spice)."
"Drinkability: Good, refreshing Wit overall that could use a drier and more spicy finish."
"Boulevard showed up at our Fred Meyer. Cool lil cardboard box six pack, but I wish that put as much thought into their beer as they did for package it comes in. Pours very flat. Hazy. Some carb. Watery and very drinkable. Sad taste compared to the real Belgian wits. Not impressed at all. Buy something else from Europe."
"Drinkability? Easy enough to drink, I guess, I find it an ok Wit Bier."
"Notes - An above average witbier, this is nice on a hot summer night. I'd like to try it on draft."
"D: Nicely done. Very approachable and delicious. Good summer beer."
"I wouldn't buy this one, and would opt for the Unfiltered Wheat if faced with the choice because at least the Unfiltered Wheat version doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. This is really a bad interpretation of a witbier, and there are many other better beers that could be had if this was the style that was being sought."
"D: Very high! The low ABV make it very sesssionable while the flavors make me want to keep reaching for another. This is a cool style of summer beer- of of my favorites."
"A little heavy-handed on the coriander, but Zon is a step above the average, run-of-the-mill Spring/Summer Wits that line the shelves this time of year. And the lower ABV definitely makes it possible to drink these all afternoon long on a hot day."
"D: This isn't a great beer by any means, it's a little too unrefined and too heavy on the coriander. However, the beer tastes good, and is very easy and a great pleasure to drink. Despite its shortcomings, this seasonal will probably become an annual purchase for me."
"Finally got around to reviewing this one. Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a hazy lemon with a 2 inch head that fades into just a thin cap. Very little lacing is present. The nose is a odd mixture of a traditional hefe and a witbier. Clove and banana are therefrom the traditional hefe and coriander, wheat tanginess, and just a hint of citrus from the wit. To me, its just a odd blend of a.romas The taste is holy coriander. Note to Boulevard, please calm down with the coriander. After that its just a little sour wheat and clove. Man, I get clove and banana off my palate. Just not a huge fan of Zons flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light and mildly carbonated. Overall, I'm just not a fan of this beer."
"I should note that I really like this brewery. It's American made, available regularly (and in variety) in my locale, and it's producing good beers. This is a very solid seasonal brew."
"Pours from the bottle a somewhat cloudy, yet inviting, light straw color, with a big, rocky white head. Not a whole lot in the aroma, maybe a little lemon, some spice and a bit of yeast. On the palate, this one is a little bready, yeasty and spicy. Refreshing and simple, a nice antidote to a warm spring afternoon."
"Drinkability is great - I love this style of beer, and judging by the scores, it's obviously very misunderstood. Bummer. I can drink these all summer long (and in fact do, from a very similar home brewed version)."
"Drinkability is good. Nothing to stop you but nothing to keep you"
"Pours a cloudy, yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of clove, yeast, sweet malt, citrus (banana), and and very slight hop. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of clove, yeast, citrus (banana), and slight sweet malt. Body is lacking, mouth feel is a little watery, carbonation level is too high, and appearance is poor."
"it finished a nice warming and med. body with strong yeast flavors lingering on the tongue. a very nice example of the wit beer and drinkable to boot!"
"I found this Wit to be uninspiring. Overall flavor is bland...."
"Easy to drink, low ABV would make it a good one to sit outside on a summer day and tear through a 6er. However it's a bit chilly up here in the Midwest on a late October evening...."
"D - good."
"12 oz. bottle, best by date 10/10/09. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small, fizzy white head, disappears quickly. Aroma is yeast, citrus (orange), floral, wheat, and spices. Flavor is sweet, citrus (orange again), and wheat. Mouthfeel is pretty light, dry, and a touch of bitterness at the end. Very drinkable, not my favorite one, but good lawnmower beer."
"Decent beer, solid in many aspects - but very forgettable."
"R - Very drinkable"
"D: Drinkability is excellent. A first year sorority girl could pound these, at least for a few minutes!"
"Conclusion: Not my favorite Wit, but definitely a solid representation of the style, and not overly sweet like many American Wits."
"- Huge on drinkablility.. very light, flavorful, and can drink all day!"
"Draught: This one pours a hazy, cloudy golden color. There was a small white head on mine. The aroma is nice. There are notes of banana, wheat, yeast, breadiness, some spices. The taste is along the same lines. This one has a slightly creamy body. Overall, this is a pretty decent Wit. It was especially nice to find a decent beer at a Royals game."
"D: Excellent and very refreshing! Great summer beer."
"I bought a 6 pack of this beer after the tour and took it home. I served it in a pint glass. There are a few beers that I say you can just smell forever. And people comment to me sometimes how long i smell some beers before I taste them, this was one of them. The beer was light in color and cloudy. The smell was amazing, a mixture of yeast and the sweet ether smell associated with some belgian styles. It went down smooth and had very little after taste. This beer was excellent. Wit is not my favorite style, but there was no citrus aftertaste sometime associated with some Wit beers. It was great."
"Overall it isn't a bad offering at all. I would have liked it to be a bit bolder but it's still very drinkable and a solid beer during the summer months."
"Pours pale yellow, very cloudy. Smells of malt, yeast, and a bit of citrus. Quickly vanishing white head. Tastes of spices and citrus as well as wheat and malt. Strongly carbonated with a medium-thin feel. Overall not bad at all, good on a hot summer day."
"d: highly drinkable, solid brew with some good balance in the flavor"
"This is a refreshing but not insipid version of a Belgian witbier. It's too tart to please someone whose idea of a wheat beer is something brewed by Pyramid or Widmer, but if you want to save some coin and buy a domestically-brewed beer instead of, say, a Hoegaarden, you could do a lot worse than this. Consumed on a summer night, but it could have hit the spot in the middle of a hot day as well."
"drinkability is great - a beer with an abv under 5% that taste this good and this very reasonable $$ - i think i just found my summer session beer"
"Taste: Has good spiced flavor initially but loses it fairly quickly, I really like the taste but wish it stuck around longer"
"Overall, a very good wit that I give high recommendation. This one finds a semi-home in my wit rotational. It's a summer seasonal so works out well so not to burn out on it. Will be perfect for hot Texas summers."
"Overall, it's pretty subdued and flavorless. Otherwise had potential to be good wit."
"Very light, refreshing but a little thin an lacking character."
"Nice golden yellow color, hazy as expected with a short filmy head, looks exactly like you would expect a witbier to look. Smells yeasty and like floral soap. There is a lot more yeast in the flavor, citrus notes, spices, pretty good but not overpowering. Very easy to drink..."
"poured with a nice white head that mostly subsided and no lace. Color is a hazy medium yellow. Aroma is good with a spice tartness. Smells fresh! Flavor isgood also. I pick up some spice and a little malt, tart light lemon qualities along with some yeast. Body is a tad on the thin side and well carbonated. Finish is clean from the tartness. Don't know if I'd personally want it as a session beer, but could see as how some folks would."
"D: Pretty standard Wirbier fare, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Light body makes it go down easy. A decent summer quaffing beer."
"Pours a super cloudy yellow, with a thin white head. Smells of spices and wheat. Taste is dry, malty, hint of tartness from the wheat. The Belgian yeast strain used is very evident too. Aftertaste is of spices. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, nice low carbonation levels. Drinkability is very high, low alcohol, light, refreshing, yet not bland makes this a super summer beer."
"D: High on the list. Cool that I can just grab a sixer at the grocery store. That helps."
"this brew pours up a cloudy golden color with a small white head. the nose is a lotta yeast, bananananana, slight citrus. the taste is the same as the nose but with more citrus. medium bodied and low carbo. This beer is caliente!"
"Another solid offering from Boulevard. Not my favorite, but solid none the less."
"D - This is a decent enough witbier, but perhaps a bit average. Nonetheless, it's pretty refreshing on a spring/summer day."
"Tangy and tart, quaffable and refreshing. This is my new ""outdoor around the grill"" beer. This much solid flavor and only 3.4% ABV? That's just ridiculously awesome. I could drink a whole gang of these, and enjoy the last one as much as the first. Cheers!"
"I am trying to rehab my taste buds after burning them out on increasingly heavy IBUs. This has a pale yellowish color and I could smell citrus right away. I liked the higher carbonation than expected and was able to taste the citrus and maybe coriander? Very well balanced. A beer you could have several of."
"Overall impression: Decent session beer, but nothing I will seek out again."
"Drinkability: Huh. Very similar to their Wheat beer, except, of course, for the additions of coriander and citrus peel. As with their Wheat beer, it's just a tad too prickly in carbonation for me."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a drinkable styly that has a nice character; like Belgian Wit meets German Heffe."
"By the way, it's almost low enough in alcohol to sell in Colorado grocery stores!"
"smell:"
"Overall light and refreshing."
"Overall: Thanks go to Vancer for this beer. I really liked it. The onlt problem was the bandaide aftertaste. It is still worth drinking."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: High carbonation is good but it is a bit watery and plain."
"Finish is a nice citrus and a slight hop bittering, but very easy to drink."
"This might very well be a good beer to give to someone who really likes drinking Blue Moon, as an example of a more restrained, balanced, less oppressively orangey example of the style."
"Smell is very light lemon and not much else. This is actually, next to the Bully Porter, their least offensive beer I've had. Crisp, clean, refreshing and very easy drinking. Plenty of carbonation. Decent and would be great on a hot, sticky, summer day. I could drink this one again."
"It honestly was more like weizen than a wit to me but that was alright. I love both styles. It is not as spicy as most wits. I did not taste the coriander or other spices sometimes affiliated with wits. The orange in it is also mild. There are some good citrus tones but not the usual. It is a hazy yellow color and a little creamy looking. This beer has a great white head and lace. It smells like bananas, cloves some citrus. It is very drinkable and refreshing. I thought the taste was great just don't be expecting it to taste like other wits you have tried."
"D- This is a great summer beer, incredibly refreshing and a great wit from the midwest. Very sessionable and not too pricey."
"D: At 3.4% drinkability is not a problem. Not a big fan of wits and this did not impress me. On a hot summer day this would be awesome though. Almost October in Albany is a little out of place for this."
"This is the second beer that I have tried from the brewery, and this beer if faring better than the wheat beer. There exists the same acidic, citrus, lemony bubblegum notes but the beer seems to fit the style better, even with these strong characteristics. The beers appearance lacks the uniform, creamy haze and soft head formation / retention expected. The yeasty spices are strong, phenolic, estery notes dominate the nose and flavors and not allowing the soft malts, breadiness, or hops to balance. The grain character rises and also keeps the soft, powdery, confection notes from shinning like they should. Lightly astringent from the lemon notes and graininess hurts the beer from the taste, on through the textures and finish. the carbonation is high with a bite and tingle, but not with the expected softness. Though they are far worse witbiers available, this one struggles to compete with the Hoegaardens and Celis of the world."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a pale, cloudy yellow color with a thin milky head. The smell is typical for a beer of the style; spicy phenols, banana, clove, orange peel, corriander and some yeast breadyness. The taste almost reminds me of an orange-banana juice. The corriander and orange peel are just right, there is a slight hop bitterness but no apparent hop flavor. The mouthfeel is light in body and the carbonation has a creaminess about it. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. It tastes great, would be excellent on a hot day and the low ABV makes it a very sessionable beer."
"This beer pours a a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of mild coriander, and a little orange peel. The taste has more orange and less coriander than the aroma, but is still quite mild. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that seems a bit low for a witbier. Overall, this is a weak ezample of a wit. I don't think I will be drinking this again."
"While I could easily see people drinking many of these on a hot summer day, personally, the phenol taste throws me off. It's just a bit too much."
"D: Decent enough witbier but nothing special."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"I was surprised by this beer. I was thinking it might end up being a pretty generic Belgian Style Wit, but it was a little better than that. The look was a pale yellow, with just a little head that quickly went away. The taste and smell is of lemon and other citrus, but not overpowering. It is light and refreshing, but still has a nice bit of flavor. Not a bad Belgian style Wit. It could have a little more kick to it, but it is still good."
"D - On a lawnmower? I'll take 9. With dinner? Pass."
"This poured yellow with a small head. Smelled very citrusy with tones of wheat and yeast. Tasted as the nose suggested it would, with strong lemon/citrus at first, with a wheat/yeast aftertaste. Not too much going on, but then again it shouldn't. This was an okay beer, a great thirst quencher."
"D- This is a crisp refreshing beer with some good flavor but more fruit that malt/wheat flavors. There was a good amount of hops at the finish and the sweetness that came through as it warmed was soft but nice."
"D: this is a perfect session beer, small ABV, crisp and clean. One of the best summer seasonals around."
"Pours a cloudy medium bright yellow with a couple fingers of pilloy whie head that leaves some small amounts of circular lace as is quickly drops.The nose is mildly sweet and lemony with some spicy yeast in the background.This is a tasty Witbier,dry tangy citrus greets the tastebuds followed closly by smoothe Belgian flavors,the lemon within is subtle and not as overwhelming as some Hefes(imo) which is why I enjoy Wits over other German offerings.I don't taste the orange the label refers to,tho there is some sweetness(maybe banana)that comes through.The body is light and the finish is as crisp and clean as they come.I have no doubt I would finish a six pack in a night,or they may disappear even faster on a hot summer afternoon!"
"this beer is very easy to drink, but i've had better witbeers. nevertheless, it was a fun one to try."
"Not my favorite style but drinkable."
"This brew is a bright cloudy yellow color with a modest white head and thin lacing. It smells slightly citrusy wheat and hints of pretzel. Somewhat thin bodied but the flavor is decent with notes of your basic wheat and citrus refreshment. Very easy drinking but it has a spicey/peppery effect. A little anemic for me but it's OK for the style."
"Wish the ABV was a bit higher. Couldn't see myself buying more than 1 or 2 sixers of this a year, but a good warm weather brew nonetheless."
"In a lot of ways this is a tame version of an already fairly tame style, but in the Hot Missouri Summers.. this one really fits the bill and is near perfect in such a situation."
"Resists the overcarbonation sometimes associated with ""summer"" beers while still supporting enough of a body to make it respectable. Low ABV combined with an overall amiability makes this a nice choice for an 80 degree day i.e. today."
"Cool beer from Tim.. next time send me a few so I can share them with some other local BA's and get their take. :-)"
"Smooth and easy to drink, but a little too light. It's not bad though and is a bit refreshing."
"On this hot, sunny day, ZON is just what the doctor ordered. Not exactly complex, but certainly pleasant. What Boulevard has incorporated with ZON, it has done quite well. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a light opaque and hazey pale yellow with highlights of wet parchment. No head or foam, but good bubbling. The aroma is a papery citrus wth hints of herbal hops. The taste has a dry coriander and grains of paradise with some citrus peel noites. Very refreshing beer. Just cleanses whatever flavors that may have been lingering before you stated drinking this beer."
"Served in a glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer poured a hazy straw, forming a 1/2 inch head and no lacing visible. Basic aroma for a witbier, consisting of wheat and a lemony aroma dominating the nose. Taste follows aroma in that it again is dominated by the fruity flavor and a bit of wheat bread in the finish. Light smooth mouthfeel and good flavor make for a highly drinkable witbier. Overall, this is a great beer. Not too complex, making for an easy drinker, and full enough in flavor to crave another."
"D-Very easy to drink its a light and refreshing beer doesnt have alot of bute or anything good summer brew."
"Quite drinkable wit, not complex but reasonably tasty. One of the better of the Boulevard lineup that I've had."
"It had a very smooth taste. Lightly sweetened, and not really bitter at all. It smelt a bit fruity and sweet. The feel was kinda thick, but not syurpy."
"Cloudy, yellow, small white head with a musty yeast smell. Taste is light lemony notes and musty belgian yeast along with some wheat. The smells of these types of beer remind me of trash. So so drinkability for this beer but I opted to dump and move on to the next one as it just isn't my speed."
"j.f."
"One of Boulevard's weaker offerings."
"I could see myself drinking a few of these as lawnmower beers, but there are so many better wit beirs, it would have to be on sale for me to purchase more."
"I love supporting Blvd - a company I think fits the mold of a quality midwestern brewery. I'll certainly purchase this one again as part of my wit rotation. I have to wonder if the late date has an impact."
"Overall, nice wit. I liked it better since I had I reviewed it last, earlier in the summer. I'll use the old dating line here: It's not you (Zon), it's me. I think my taste has matured and this beer is a good one."
"Drinkability: Very good beer after a long hike. It's a good intrepretation of a Belgian wit. Not many American craft brewers make a wit, but this one is satisfying if unspectacular."
"Spicy coriander seems to be front and center with this brew, good wheaty backbone to it as well. Not much citrus. Fairly mellow, not too tart or bitter. Wheat lends a certain smoothness to the mouthfeel. Super refreshing...i'm regretting not buying a couple six packs of this."
"I keep returning to this all summer long. Cloudy pale golden color with a nice white head. The combination of citrus and spices is very nice. There is a sweetness to it and a slight banana clove flavor. Definite cardamon flavor is present in the finish, with the citrus adding a nice tang. It makes my tongue slightly numb in a pleasant way. It reminds me of biting into a delicious spicy muffin, but it's refreshing. I've never had a muffin I would call refreshing. Anyway, I could have this for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
"Competent."
"S - One hell of a summer session brew! This slakes thirst like water puts out fire."
"Drinkability: An ok beer, good on a hot day, goes down easy. ABV is ridiculously low, one could drink these all day I guess, except I would tire of the taste quickly. This is my least favorite Boulevard seasonal beer."
"overall this is a very refreshing beer very low abv with is good cause in the hot summer im not too eager to have a big beer"
"Very small white head which leaves no lacing. Hazy lemonaid color. Smell is fairly light, hops and a bit of lemon hints. Taste is also light, basic wheat flavor with a hint of coriander and lemon. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery. Still this is a fairly drinkable brew, but I would buy Hoegaarden any day before this beer. Overall this is an ""okay"" beer, my girlfriend loves it so I end up drinking it far too often. Still its worth a try if you cant find a great beligian witbier."
"D - This beer tastes pretty good. It's not really a traditional witbier but it is still drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy, pale, golden yellow color. The head is a little thin and doesnt last very long but there is a thin layer through out the life of the beer. Aroma is a very Belgian-like. There is the familiar musty, fruity yeast aroma to go along with some clove, corriander, and lemon zest. Initial taste is the Belgiany yeast noted in the aroma which gives way to some fresh grain. Good amount of spicing in this beer as well, also some light citrus. Nice sessionable, very Belgian-like Wit that would be great for a hot day, and with the very low ABV you can drink it all day."
"Flavor is similarly light in body, good spicing which is mostly coriander I think. Very faint citric lightness, light grain flavor. Carbonation is really high, mouthfeel a little watery but spot-on for the wit style. At 3.4%, you can seriously drink a lot of these."
"Boulevard Zon was a very cloudy pale yellow color. The white head quickly dissipated to a thin layer. The aroma was mostly coriander with a hint of orange. The taste was also dominated by the coriander with a little citrus over a light malt base with some wheat evident. The body was medium to light with a medium to high carbonation level. This is a good refreshing summer ale."
"Pale yellow, cloudy body. Thin, bubbly white head on the pour, half inch thick. Reduced to nothing. Strong banana in the nose, clove rounds it out. Pretty typical for a wheat beer. Predominate wheat taste, banana and clove again. This is pretty standard again but its pretty good. Nice spiciness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Crisp and fairly carbonated. Nothing outstanding flavorwise, but this is somewhat expected. I like this though. Nice and refreshing, crisp. Just what I expect."
"I like wits, so I tried Boulevard's version. I didn't pick up much spice in this so it got a little downgraded. It's better than their unfiltered wheat, but not as good as some of their other beers."
"Pours a cloudy medium yellow color with a super white, fluffy head that is mountainous. Nose is strong of wheat and citrus fruit. Some flowery notes too. Palate is soft, slightly sweet, and and has a citrusy tang as well. Coriander and a little clove, orange or lemon peel, and powdered sugar. Light/medium body with a dry finish. Moderate carbonation. A very drinkable witbier."
"Pours a cloudy off yellow with no head or lacing to speak of. The nose has a slight must to it. There are hints of orange, coriander, yeast and some bubble gum. No hops to speak of. The palate is crisp and acidic with pale malts and corriander dominating the flavor profile. Again, hints of bubble gum and yeast. The mouthfeel is light and crisp which seems appropriate for the style. Seems easy enough to drink, but I am not particularly a fan of the style so it loses drinkability points for me."
"Well I had to try this one. And before this review makes it sound like I am tearing the beer apart, I must say it is a pretty decent drink for a $6 sixer. The appearance is hazy honey gold with little if any head...it takes a vigorous pour to make the large borax white bubbles expose. The smell is faint, mostly banana yeast notes with some rough clove and weak grainy wheat. The taste is...mighty fine pretty soft up front but a bit tangy in the middle with some sour orange/lemon notes and a bit of hop character the fihish is mildy sweet and sour with some hop again and a nice yeasty bottom....pretty good. The mouthfeel is largly watery comfortably creamy, decent. Overall a very drinkable beer....not as good as Hoegaarden or Allagash about on par with Blue Moon but not quite as quaffable due to the yeasty nature. A decent drink, give it a try if you can."
"Into a pint glass, poured a pretty good whitish head at first, murky golden yellow, quite fizzy, with head fizzling out to half-film. Aroma is true to belgian wheat style, quite citric, with the yeast and wheat saying hi just for a sec. Taste is tart and citric up front, picking up orange peel, wheaty through the middle, kind of evening out, with a lively mouth in the finish, some lemon and/or orange zest as it falls away. Like the mouth from start to finish, and at 3.4 ABV, very drinkable and tasty to boot. I'll be picking up a few more methinks."
"With the 4.4% abv, this makes for a solid summer session brew, and with a easy-on-the-pocket price! A darn good cut at a US version of a witbier. Wifey really enjoyed hers, Ill be back for more of this one."
"Poured into a tumbler pint glass. Slight hazy yellow color. White head about a finger thick. Not much in the way of lacing. Nice lemon grass smell with hop notes. Pleasant lemon citrusy flavor. Not strong enough to create a puckery sensation. Very clean taste. Mouthfeel is light and a little oily. Very refreshing. this was great a cookout."
"Drinks okay, just not enough here to hold my attention. Try during the heat of summer"
"It's easy to drink and pleasant to taste. A nice summer refresher, but only average as a wit."
"The body is light but ok, and the carbonation is high which is ok. Accents some of the orangey flavors. Overall I would have like the taste to have taken it further but still a alright wit."
"Pours a hazy golden colour with a very, nice little head. Citrus and yeast on the nose. Flavors are a subdued citrus that are mixed in with a tad of spiciness and a whisp of banana. This merges into a creamy, delicious refreshing wit. I wish this were local. Great, especially summertime, thirst quencher or overall session brew. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle"
"This is a witbier with a definite focus on refreshment. It pours with a standard ""unfiltered"" opacity and a quickly dissipating head. It is very mild (and possibly a bit thin tasting) but pleasant, and very drinkable. There is a definite sour citrus tang, which is perhaps not balanced well enough with other flavors, but I can see this being a sold hot weather beer. Not much to say; if you want something yeasty and fruity but not too complicated, you could do worse than ZON."
"This beer has a great refreshing taste with a nose of coriander and a hint of orange peel. The color is a cloudy upon pouring and tends to clear up a little after settling. Not much body, with a thin fast disappearing white head. I really enjoy this style of witbier boulevard seasonally produces and is great during the hot summer months of Kansas City."
"Should be a good hot weather refresher."
"Zon is an acceptable witbier. On the few occasions that I drink beer of this style, I don't think I'll have any difficulty locating a better one. Having said that, it went down easily enough; and given the shockingly low ABV, it would make a great session beer for those who don't want to get 'in the Zon' too quickly."
"well...it's not a classic wit by any stretch of the imagination....but it has a purpose and it's pretty drinkable...or slammable. i'd buy it again to slake my thirst during the summer season. worth trying...just make sure you are thirsty!"
"Good."
"Best by 10/01/05. Obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed about a week later (April 2005). Pours a one finger pure white frothy head over a dirty light lemon colored liquid. Smells funky, bready, yeasty, oranges, and coriander. It smells pretty good, which is quite a compliment as I dislike funky belgian styles (this was sold to me as a 'summer wheat'...oops). Tastes...yup, funky. Not so bad as most--perhaps my tolerance for the style is improving. Here's what I get; candy sweetness, vanilla (actually quite strong and persistent), pears, mild oranges. The flavors seem muted and watery somehow, such that nothing really knocks me over here. There is a late spicey zing, but I wouldn't quite call it coriander. A bit of acrid carbonation sting arises upon swallowing to mix with the spice. Then some aromatic 'funk' qualities that I find dispicable rise up the throat. Md-light bodied and mildly carbonated. Well, they've got the style down pretty well, just a bit watery, perhaps. But I've had enough. I still don't like funky belgian styles, so down the drain with the last of it. I will score this according to style, of course, not my personal tastes."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but tangy on the tongue and palate, crisp and dry in the finish. It tasted of wheat/white bread, with just hints of the orange and coriander the label suggested. Because of the crisp, dry finish I found it to be rather drinkable! I look forward to trying again on a hot afternoon."
"The mouthfeel is kind of thick and creamy. Seems to be at both the perfect level for the style and at the perfect level for my tastes. Reveals an interesting range of flavors when swished around the mouth. I might just have to drink a shit ton of this stuff during the summer. This brew tends to get a fairly bad rep around here, even among Boulevard fans, but I find it to be just as good as their other seasonal offerings and even better than their year round offerings with the exception of the Bully! Porter. Try some for yourself if you can."
"Drinkability: Not rushing to get another bottle out of the fridge. Although it definitely would be a good mower beer."
"Sampled on 5/31/04"
"Yellow and hazy in appearance, this beer smells very yeasty and wheaty with a hint of orange in the background. It has a very refreshing flavor of citrus and a whole lot of wheat malt. It is a bit thin and has a low ABV, but this makes the beer a great summer refresher, when you don't want a heavy beer."
"Lightly sweet, crisp, wheat malt flavors up front. Notes of coriander, banana, and yeast accompany. Finish is tangy bitter, yeasty, and slightly medicinal, even with the low alcohol. Bubbly, champagne-like feel, yet medium-bodied (thanks to the wheat protein). A nice refreshing summer beer."
":-) Sunny Smiles and a Big Thanks to BigHuge for this one!"
"Looks alot like lemon juice, fizzy firm starch white cap, fizzes away quickly to a thin collar, not much lacing- very minimal spots. Aroma is of fresh cirtusy lemon and orange rinds, quite zesty, spicy with some lemon zip and crispy with wheat. Taste is a bit short lived and tame, not as long or sharp as most Wit's. The lemon is tame as is the wheat structure, spices are low and non lingering. Fades off pretty quickly leaving some woodish pulp, pear, and apple notes and finishes a bit empty if not watery. An OK beer at best. Still like Bully though."
"Poured a hazy copper color with a decent size white head. As white biers go, this one is pretty standard. Smelled slightly of citrus and yeast. Taste was crisp and uninsulting, but didn't do that much for me. This was fine on a humid, rainy summer night while grilling some steaks, but this is not a beer I would pursue again."
"Edit: Subsequent samples have been not quite as ""yeasty"" as my first trial! I have upgraded the smell rating accordingly! (from 2 to 3) That first bottle must have just gotten an extra heavy hit of yeast!"
"Well-sedimented pale yellow with that greenish Wit tint. Minimal head, speckly in bubble sizes. Lace is very limited to dots. Clove aroma, faintest bit of orangey notes, coriander not noticeable. Flavor comes off very uniform and non-complex, all the elements come together quickly except for that slightly medicinal sense I get late in the swallow on a lot of Witbiers. Rolling ester impressions, tinged by an almost pesto-like basil herbal botanical quality. Within bounds for the style. Well-done Wit, perhaps a bit lacking in mouthfeel at the end, where it seems to flatten and get just a bit watery."
"In tandem with their Unfiltered Wheat, the Boulevard guys have a good summer line up- though I'll probably drink more of the Pale."
"Pours a tight white head of moderate duration and minimal lacing. Color is a murky whitish-yellow. Aroma is full of fruity esters with a healthy hint of vanilla and spice. Creamy, tangy, sharp and spicy all at first sip! The creaminess really sticks with you here, with the vanilla hints lingering nicely also. Mouthfeel is smooth, punctuated by the sharp, spicy yeastiness. Malt backbone is firm yet subtle, this is not a big beer . . . I just wanna say all of your papers seem to be in order sir, well find a spot for you in First Class! One of the most approachable interpretations of the style Ive had in some years, close enough to a Bavarian Hefeweizen to make the style easily approachable/drinkable to the kids and gals cutting their teeth on the big Bavarian exports downtown. I might take Victorys Whirlwind Wit over this on personal preference, but nobody seems to wanna carry that Victory brand round town, so Ill gladly drink hell outta this one : )"
"Overall this is a very tasty, very drinkable beer. This is a mainstay in my fridge when its available."
"Kudos to Boulevard!! If you are ever in the Kansas City area, take the tour! www.blvdbeer.com"
"Really, the taste is the thing most 'wrong' with this beer and it's not objectionable."
"I look forward to this seasonal from Boulevard every year. This is some good beer."
"Pours a cloudy almost pale white in color, light fruity yeasty aromas, small white foamy head that doesn't last too long. Light wheat and mild fruity flavors, light body with a watery mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, pretty average and mostly refreshing."
"Pours an ugly, straw color, does not deter from the appearance. Has a sharp aroma of wheat and grain. Some lemon, orange peel and coriander noted off the top, blended very nicely. Crisp and zesty, clearly fits the refreshing category, lightly creamy and clean, finishes a bit thin. Regardless of wheat or wit or white, a great thirst quencher."
"There was a white head for a minute there, but its gone now. The beer is a real pale (almost white at the bottom) straw color, with lots of cloudiness throughout. There are a lot of flavors going on in here, some lemon, orange, and probably others tucked away. Very crisp and tangy. An interesting brew, obviously made for the hot sun. I like it well enough."
"Much thanks to marc77!"
"On the pour a lemon yellow, highly ""Chill hazed", the head a creamy white and modest in size with oodles of fine lace to cover the glass. Wheat aroma, like fresh ground flour, light hints of coriander and orange peel, along with that citrus crisp freshness that is quite appealing in the Wit style. The start tart with an underlying sweetness, the top skimpy in feel, the finish stingingly acidic, personable on the hops, desert dry aftertaste that is lightly bitter and long lasting, cant say Wits excite me all that much, but this one is quite drinkable."
"Like the wheat, this brew comes to you with a bright yellow color and white foamy head.  The aroma is quite tangy with a greater hint of banana than the German wheat.  The flavor is a bit lighter than the German wheat, but still tasty and refreshing.  There is a quick latent hop bitter bite.  Not my favorite white, but a very good representation."
"Hazy/cloudy brightish yellow....mainly cloves on the nose....kind of thinish in the mouth....decent flavor but far from the top wits...a slight hint of orange's on the buds, but the taste is rather subdued....Ok...nothing more....not bad but nowhere near the top of this class..."
"More cloudy than the light haziness I expected, but OK. Pours a bright white, but short lived head. The aroma is quite impressive - very authentically Belgian with a light citrus (lemon), some spiciness and a sweet fruitiness (peach, maybe a little mango in the back there somewhere?). I even pick up some bubblegum towards the end of the glass. The flavor is more subdued with a very limited malt and a light, dry fruitiness. There's some coriander at mid swallow, and the finish is dry with a light touch of acidity. The light bodied but zesty palate helps to pull this off. A-just-above-average beer with a good label and name that has no flaws but leaves me almost wishing it had some to give it a little bit of complexity. Of course, there are Belgian Wits that have the same straight-forward, non-complexity so I can't fault them for it. This is my perfect ""lawnmower beer""!"
"I picked up 4 varieties from Boulevard Brewing Co. while I was in Iowa last weekend.  I wanted to get some Stone City, but I didn't travel far enough south to find that.  These Blvd. brews were definitely a surprise though.  All 4 were pretty solid.  (The other 3 should follow tonight.)"
"Easy to drink and tastes good, but tastes more like a weak hefeweizen than a Belgian Wit.  Decent beer, but does not live up to the standards set by Pierre Celis (Hoegaarden, Celis). Goes great with scrambled eggs and sausage (don't ask...)"
"I was disappointed in this Boulevard product. Id drink it again but it is not worth purchasing a 6-pack of"
"Alcohol Content: 3.4% by weight"""
"Very hazy straw hue w/ ample bubbles, but the poorly retained head is a bit disappointing. Loads of bubblegum esters hit the nose at first, and are followed by clove and phenolic notes.  Spices round out the nose and include the typical bitter orange notes and coriander, but I swear I detect a hint of star - anise in there also.  Fairly light in body for a wheat, and unfortunately fairly light in flavor as well.  The taste doesn't continue where the aroma left off.  Upfront wheat tartness is followed by very mild phenol and green apple flavors.  Finishes dry and unexciting. That being said, the drinkability is quite good.  The trick is to not think of it as a real Belgian Wit, but a Wit / American hefeweizen hybrid."
