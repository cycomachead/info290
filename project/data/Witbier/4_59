Very mild aromas, mild fruit and floral hints (not what I would describe as "fruity") and blended flavors, very good feel.  Finishes with a low level hop bitter that fades quickly.

Exceptional lacing adorns this straw yellow wit, a fitting touch for such a good looking brew. It is remarkably hazy & totally opaque, in spite of the pale color. The scent is intoxicating, rivaling some of its finest German and Belgian brethren. Banana-like esters, coriander and clove play against a sourdough bread bouquet. Very mildly sweet, with flavors of banana candy, peppered clove, and some tart lemon citrus on the back end. Grains of wheat, orange citrus and some tangy, dry bitterness in the finish. The beer is surprisingly creamy due to the zesty carbonation and unfiltered goodness. However, the body is moderate, so it remains refreshing. This one went down in record time. It's just fantastic. Wits are typically not my proverbial cup of tea, but this one holds its own against any style. It remains true to form while imparting its own distinct character. I love to come back to this after some hearty double stouts or rich porters, to remind myself that bold flavor comes in many forms. If you're in to wheat beers at all, you have to try this. If you're not, you still have to try this.","JohnnyI","Jan 05, 2015"

This one is different from the fold in that it's drier on the finish and it has some negative tin and biscuit flavors roaming around in there. Overall not a bad beer and one to enjoy in pleasure.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 28, 2014"

As I stated above, this is an amazing, basically textbook example, of a Belgian Witbier and shouldn't be missed by anyone interested in the style. Perhaps the only thing missing is a touch of honey flavor, that would make it perfect in my opinion.","MikeB20","Oct 18, 2014"

You can smell some fruity aromas coming from the beer during the first sips. It's a medium to light bodied beer with an aftertaste of signature Belgian yeast. To cut the story short, if you want a belgian beer and it's too hot to enjoy a darker beer, then the Allagash White is an excellent choice.","beerwithbears","Jul 04, 2014"

3.82,-8,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Prickly on the tongue. Soft wheat character with a slow and growing dryness that really lays on the tongue. Ample carbonation leads to immediate gas. Still is a little cold, so I'll let it sit a bit and see if it opens up a little more. Softer spicing than in the aroma. This one is cleaner than most and spices takes less of a strong role in the overall flavor with more emphasis on the wheat character. To me it actually calls for a little fruit addition (something I would never have said a few years ago). A light tartness and sourness shows in time.","garymuchow","Jun 11, 2014"

APPEARANCE: hazily unfiltered, tawny yellow body exhibits slow, steady carbonation; thin white head settles quickly; some tracings.. AROMA: lively lemon zest, allspice and honey greets the nostrils--more than pleasant, even (especially?) in winter... PALATE: soft as falling snow with a fizz that sounds the same; light and cleansing--highly drinkable; a satisfying, lingering aftertaste...TASTE: slightly malt; damp lemongrass with some intriguing spiciness--pepper and allspice--delicious; yeasty enough to hold attention and round complexity... OVERALL: I liked this so much, I gifted my wife's uncle with some for Christmas--and he agreed that this white is as formidable as we've encountered...","dacrza1","Dec 30, 2013"

The fruity crispness, corriander, slight spice, and hazy appearance make you long to be sitting on your deck in July.

Now the only problem is how I am going to get my hands on another bottle, since Allagash does not distribute to Wisconsin, yet. 17/20","THANAT0PSIS","Apr 29, 2013"
4.62,11.3,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Beautiful Witbier made by Allagash, with a charming orange-peel aroma, honey, coriander seeds, and, in a smaller scale, pepper and wheat ideas. The spiceness is more evident in the taste, that besides bringing the other elements of the aroma, displays a slight hop bitterness that is well-paired with the other characteristics. The light, relatively well carbonated body leaves such subtle hop bitterness at the end. I am absolutely fascinated by the quality of the Allagash White - I love it.","HabiMendes","Apr 28, 2013"

The flavor is light lemony wheaty yeasty and refreshing. Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel.

The smell is very sweet, of fruit - especially bananas and something else I am unable to distinguish. The smell is extremely satisfying. There is barely a hint of alcohol at all and there are notes of banana and cloves and even a little caramel. Despite the sweetness there is a fine balance with the hops. The carbonation is just right - not overpowering and not flat. One of the best beers I've had recently and Allagash White certain gives many European whites a run for their money.","biteme398","Sep 30, 2012"

It looks like what I’d expect from a wheat beer. I got a lot of lemon and coriander when I first smelled it. On first sip, you definitely get the coriander. It’s not overwhelming, but it’s not overly simple either. It’s a nicely balanced beer. I’m also getting a little bit of clove, and the more that I drink it and the citrus flavors definitely come out. It’s got a nice carbonation to it and I could see easily putting away a bunch of these while sitting on a patio on a summer night.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

Smell is mild lemon and honey. A little coriander and yeast. Taste is a bit bolder with a front end that is sweet. Notes of cloves, citrus and lemon that give way to a bit of spice and zesty pepper. Well balanced and complex. A touch of hops at the end to stablize the tart front. Feel is nice and light with a decent amount of carbonation. Overall- A very nice take on the style with the zesty finish and unique look. Like the blend of tart and spicy. A very refreshing summer brew that gets better as it warms.

Aromas are light and well blended, with clove spicing highlighting bready and banana characteristics. Smells really good. Flavors are smooth and rich, with a subtle sharpness from the carbonation. Bready, clove, pepper, and oregano spicing all form a solid backbone, with banana sweetness layering the flavor profile. Very well balanced. Tremendous flavors that are not overpowering. There is a low, smooth fruit and spice aftertaste, leading to a slightly spicy sharp finish that cleans the palate. You won't find many better Wits than this, especially stateside.

Light aroma of wheat and Belgian wheat beer spicing. A hit of sulphur at first. Taste is great, wheat, yeast, clove and a hint of lemon. Finishes a bit sweet, without the residual spice astringency in many wheat beers. A very nice, pleasant witbeer. Hope to try again.","LiquidAmber","Mar 13, 2012"

Refreshing but with an almost yeast bite like finish. Some detectable banana up front as well. Semi sweet aftertaste but overall pretty good. The only problem is that it comes in 4 packs.

The body is soft and velvety smooth with a delicately tingly carbonation level. It's light and extremely drinkable, with the balance tipped slightly toward the bitter side of the scale. The peppery hops character is noticeable, but not overbearing, and it doesn't hang around on the palate, which is a good thing given the style of a wit. Overall, this is probably one of the best wits I've ever had.","Rootdog316","Dec 14, 2011"

Very nice aromas here and are very true to style as well. Taste of big spices, banana, clove, citrus peel, wheat, and breadiness. Not much bitterness on the finish, but there are plenty of lingering notes of spice, citrus, bread, and clove. Medium-high carbonation with medium body; with a great and slightly creamy mouthfeel, that leads to very smooth and enjoyable drink.

The smells of citrus and other spices are very much in this beer. The aroma is probably the best part of this beer. The taste is good too but I felt that it fell just a bit short compared to the aromas is was giving off. The mouthfeel was pretty good for a white ale as well. Nicely carbonated and smooth.","Knapp85","Apr 09, 2011"
4.65,12,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Allagash White pours a hazy lemon yellow, with just a faint bit of visibility present. The first pour only yielded about a finger's worth of fluffy white foam to top the beer, but after drinking down about half the glass I swirled what was left in my bottle and poured. I was rewarded with more than three fingers of head threatening to spill out over my glass, and receding very slowly. Rings of lacing look like halos gracing the top of my glass. The nose is solid for a wit, heavy on citrus (predominantly orange, but a bit of lemon present as well), with some sweet, cracker pale malt sweetness thrown in for good measure. There's much more to this beer though, as citrus and pale malt sweetness are joined on my palate by a slight tangy quality from the wheat and a touch of pepper. I'm actually a little bit in awe of just how perfectly every flavor is proportionally represented, I couldn't come up with a better blend if I tried. The body on this beer is the very definition of effervescent. The body is supremely light, but stops just short of watery, and the carbonation is bubbly and active. I've heard it described as being almost "seltzery", and I would agree, but in a very good way. Allagash White is a beer that makes me think that maybe American brewers can do some Belgian styles even better then the originals.

The smell is wheat spicy spicy belgium yeast and wheat with a hint of malt sweetness at the end. This is a very inviting smell so I proceed with no abandon. The taste of the legendary Allagash White zesty yeast on the tongue filled in with wheat graininess and a hint of sweetness such as candy sugar perhaps or maybe the sweet malts are so separated from yeast at the end of my drinks that it seems to end with a full body sweetness. This is a good example of a Witbier.","jorg2619","Apr 09, 2011"

High carbonation, lots of rising bubbles continue long after pour. Very light on the tongue. Spiciness not as heavy as expected, leans more towards the citrisy orange and lemon accompanied lightly by the spice of clove and others that presented themselves more in the aroma. Spices, clove and some cinnimin are found on the finish of the beer, the dryer notes of cinnimin and some grape linger on the toungue. Refreshing and light.

Taste is phenomenal, very much a manifestation of all the delicious smells. A classic wit with coriander, just enough lemon/orange citrus tang, very much what a Belgian wheat should taste like. Spices are dominant on the palate, and yet not in an oppressive way, still extremely refreshing and tastes like beer, not a spice rack, which is how some over-the-top wits can feel. Mouthfeel is a bit creamier and fuller than some other wits I've had, perhaps because the abv is a bit higher. For example, I'd definitely rather drink one Allagash white than a Hoegaarden, but if I had to drink a full six-pack of one, I might go with the latter. A truly excellent beer from a top-notch brewery--one of America's finest interpretation of the Belgian wit, no doubt about that.","jal30","Aug 19, 2010"

4.63,11.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer. Allagash White was my gateway beer. I can still remember the Allagash night I went to at my college's pub, where I got a pint of White in a logo pint glass I got to keep. It started my beer glass collection. Anyway, I'm reviewing a fridge chilled 12oz bottle poured into a different Allagash logo glass (a 25cl flute). I can only fit about 2/3 of the bottle into this glass, so the appearance may change after I pour in the yeast. The liquid is a slighty tarnished yellow, with a small white head. There is a lot of rising carbonation and a bit that clings to the sides. [After emptying the bottle, I bumped this category up from a 4 to a 5. There is a huge pure white head now, great lacing, and a beautiful opaque body. It looks as a wit should.] This beer has a great aroma. It is dry and sweet, with lots of Belgian sugar and yeast. I can also smell wheat, grass and a bit of pepper spice. The beer tastes of wheat and Belgian candi sugar. It has some champagne-like flavors up front, but I wouldn't say I can taste white grapes specifically. The finish has more spices; black pepper and coriander. The wheat and yeast wrap things up in the aftertaste that lingers slightly. The white has a medium body and plenty of carbonation. There isn't much coating after I swallow, but it feels like it covers every corner of my mouth white I'm drinking each sip. And oh does each sip come easily. This is such a drinkable beer. On a warm, humid day like today, I could easily drink a number of these beers. No aspect of this beer every gets tiring. Unfortunately, I think this beer gets a slightly bad rap in its hometown. I know that a number of us Portland beer nerds (aka beer snobs) occasionally look down at people who order an Allagash White when there are more adventurous beers available. A lot of us see this beer as Portland's training wheels craft beer; its fine if your scared, but real beer drinkers will get a strong, more intense beer. Is this a side-effect of the demand for extreme, barrel-aged everything? Perhaps. Either way, White deserve all the respect it can get. This is an incredible beer and a wonderful flagship for one of the best breweries in the country. It is worth ordering, no matter what the other folks at the bar think; just don't ask for a slice of lemon with it...","ToasterChef","Aug 05, 2010"

There's some very nice spiciness in the smell as well as the taste. It reminds me of white pepper and of course coriander.

Notes of exotic spices add complexity, while the orange and lemon really add a pleasing tartness overall. Very well done on all facets of a great session beer.","BretSikkink","Feb 24, 2010"

A zesty aroma of lemon with a yeasty spiciness, along with the classic scents of coriander and orange zest. The light, bread like wheat flavor comes out right away and hugs the palate. That is when the zesty citrus flavors take over, it finishes with a splash of coriander on the back of the palate. Refreshing feel, light, but not watery.

The pour is smooth but full-looking, wheat-yeast hazy yellow and leaves a nice creamy-dense head floating on an opaque yellow. The head is a nice solid, creamy hint of citrus & spice and the white lace clings thereafter to prove a nice point. The aroma exudes obvious lemon, but also tangerine, wet grass & spices from pepper to coriander. The body is smooth and silky like the head, although a bit more straight forward, while the spices definitely emerge in complexity.

Flavor is again laden with banana pith, but there's more complexity than in the aroma. Coriander is still there but it's joined by a light lemony tartness and some citrus zest. Slightly sweet doughiness paired with the citrus evokes lemon bar pastries (although not nearly as sharp or sweet). Body is thin enough to be refreshing but not too flimsy to carry the flavor. Carbonation is just a touch high, but it's soft enough to avoid being distracting.

On the nose is a definite coriander and barnyard hay with the lightest cinnamon hint intermixed with some citrus notes. Taste is fairly standard; wheat and coriander dominate with light orange and yeast notes. The coriander seems to add a slight astringency that leaves the mouth dry with the hop bitterness accentuating this, which is what I would say, is the most significant issue this beer has.

The aroma is very honeyish and light orange, although my wife says she smelled some burgers grilling in it, too. Taste is fabulous: just enough fizz to satisfy the need on a hot night, and a bright feel that is quite refreshing. I tasted much less orange than I expected based on the smell, but was in no way disappointed. Ever so slightly bitter and very clean all around. Easy to drink and hits the spot in hot weather. Another great beer from Allagash.","gfreed","Jun 08, 2008"

The smell was a flurry of flavor: yeast, spice, clove, banana, citrus fruit, wheat. Each time I stuck my nose in there, I got something different. The taste was equally wonderful, and even though there were plenty of flavors, it was perfectly balanced and not at all overwhelming. Up front, there was a grassy, wheaty flavor perfectly complimented by yeast. Then, as the beer went down, the rest of the flavors came through, especially the spices (particularly clove) and the citrus fruit (particularly orange). The beer left the mouth with a smooth, lightly bitter, crisp, refreshing taste. This was a pleasant beer to drink, a great American version of a Belgian classic.","micahgoldfus","May 13, 2008"

The smell is of zesty orange and lemon mixed with wheat and phenolic yeast maybe a tad weak though. The taste is of wheat and malty sweetness with tart orange and lemon providing bitterness with a bunch of spice coming along for the ride, coriander leads the way. In addition there is a good deal of yeasty flavor. Overall things tie together fairly well but the yeast flavor may be just a bit too dominant. The mouthfeel is crisp and light with a fair level of embedded carbonation it leaves a peppery bite in the aftertaste and finishes a touch dry, nice and lively and very refreshing. All together this is a good example of the style, the spicing isn't overdone which tends to be a flaw of many other wits, with a touch less yeastyness this would be very good.","fank2788","May 04, 2008"

The taste is a mix of an extremely citric taste dominated by lemon and a very zesty spicey taste mixed in a full body. The wheat in this beer holds it all together for a very smooth mouthfeel while the lemon and some orange make it sweet on the tongue. The spices complement it on the sides and give it a good finish.

Coriander plays a strong role in the flavor, there is also a strong citrus component as well. I would have to say that the flavor of the coriander is more prominent however. My personal preference would to have the citrus be more dominant, but in any case this is an excellent beer. Recommended.","Drew966","Oct 12, 2007"

2.83,-31.8,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"White papery yellow color. Sharp lemon, cracker and whey aromas. A creamy, milky texture gives persistent, oily bitterness surrounded by lemon and orange peel. I walk away from it and try to define what keeps me from "liking" this beer. The bitterness is a little obnoxious, but not in an absolute sense; the bitterness seems unconnected to the other flavors (and way too persistent) and for that matter, so does the light, alcohol-derived sweetness. The finish is a bit of a chore too. It felt like it took forever to dispatch 12 ounces. None of the demerits are terribly obvious, but the bitterness builds, becoming more punishing as it drains.","putnam","Oct 07, 2007"

4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Standard pint. Pours a very light straw color with a 2 finger head of stark white foam. The brew is cloudy, as expected, with a few stray bubbles in the brew, but it is generally calm. The aroma is dominated by coriander spice with a very nice creamy wheat base behind it. There is a more distant orange fruityness, but the spice is the main player here. Taking a sip, it brings what is expected from the flavors: lots of spicy coriander and lighter orange with a creamy wheat character. None of the flavors are too dominant, as they blend well into each other. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. It is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation in there to make it a little lighter. There is just a hint of herbal hop on the finish that just plays lightly at the sides of my tongue after swallowing the brew. This is the first brew I have put on my kegerator, and it really was a good choice, though I should have done a half barrel and not just a sixtel, as this one will not last too long. It is very flavorful and easy to drink. I am happy with it for sure!","kmpitz2","Sep 30, 2007"

Taste of sweet lemon, coriander which translates into a mild blueberry fruitiness, as well as clove and pepper flavors. Very balanced, superb flavors that blend and compliment.

One time it was thin, somewhat watery and a bit bitter, another time it tasted like it wasn't finished fermenting - sweet, cloying, and fresh wort flavors dominating. Lately everthing else is up to par, but just tastes way overspiced with coriander. If I can taste coriander, its probably too much, and at this point its getting into the Blue Moon range of spiciness - not good. Overwhelming coriander in the nose and on the palate really decreases the drinkability.","Longstaff","Jun 27, 2006"

It has the typical soft citrus, spicy, belgian, wheat characer. Has light yellow glitter color with a mild haze. Looks cotton-ey. Smells a little more wheat-ey and estery than most Wits; more Hefe-like. Tastes more than typically Belgin with extra souring, twangy, and yeasty. Alcohols seem heavier than normal and give a lightly phenolic and soapy character. Despite the mild off-flavors, the extra boldness is attractive. Still light and fresh feeling to the mouth.

Taste is very sweet, all wheat, slightly citrusy. Hops are muted with barely discernible, slightly bittering traces in the finish. Not much detected as for spices--the sweetness dominates. This beer sticks to style. Mouthfeel is heavy as expected, low on carbonation, and just right all around, though if I were being picky, I imagine it could be a little fuller, thicker, and heavier without approaching 'syrupy.' Given the style, to me this is slightly more drinkable than Hoegaarden, which I dislike (I realize this is heresy to some). Yes, a purist I am not--I personally prefer the flavor of SA White Ale over this. This is fine in it's own right, of course, just not one I will crave.

Smell was spicy and buttery with a definite presence of orange peel and some other light fruits. Taste was hoppy and sweet, with all of the fruit characters making themselves known. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, hoppy and incredibly balanced. What really stuck out for me with this beer was how refreshing it was. The alcohol presence is also a plus, given that it is barely noticeable, making it quite easy to drink.

Smells a little "airy" and I'm still trying to come up with just which spices are included as the label states it has some. Coriander, I think.

4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The directions on the bottle instruct you to pour the beer, then swirl the remaining yeast, then pour the dregs on the top. I strongly suggest following these steps. The first bottle I tried, I poured carefully....the result was a boring, transparent straw colored beer with no aroma. Following the directions yields a hazy, cloudy, light straw colored beer with white highlights along the edges...much more appealing and visually interesting. A very small head. The coolest part of the pour was watching the yeast disperse into the beer...it spreads out like a blob. Pouring in this manner also releases a wonderful aroma. I get a muted sweetness with a touch of spices that compliment it well. The taste is initially filled with a belgian spiciness, which eventually yields to a subtle sweetness. I don't pick up any orange or orange peel, but some coriander hits me in the aftertaste. I'm left with a pleasant amalgamation of these tastes on my tongue for quite a while after the swallow. This is a wonderfully quenching and tasting beer. I can't stress enough however, to pour properly to release its full visual and aromatic potential.","Hagbard","Oct 17, 2005"

Smells delicious - oranges, coriander, banana, pepper, spiciness, and yeast, all blended together nicely. The aroma is fairly subtle but strong enough to get some good whiffs. The taste follows suit but with an addition of spicy hops and a mild bitterness that complement the other flavors. It has a medium body that is kinda tingly yet smooth, with the last sip having the best mouthfeel. The drinkability is high as it is a complex and refreshing beer but the flavors aren't overwhelming.

Very easy to drink. Light bitterness in the aftertaste. Kind of like after biting an orange rind, but not as harsh. Awesome beer. In my opinion, this is a perfect summer beer.

Spices are much less than other wits I have tried. Citric fruits play a nice compliment to the wheaty yeasty base. Quite acidic in the finish with some spices lingering.

Nice. Small, spotty head of bright white bubbles is somewhat disappointing in terms of both size and cling. Smells come rushing right out of the bottle: candied ginger, over-ripe pear skins, and (with a generous amount of imagination) pie crusts. Nosefeel is a complex balance of powdery and moist but diminishes substantially over time. Prominent flavors of (curacao?) orange peel, coriander, and more ginger than clove. A pear-like sensation in midpalate operates as a base for this complex spice profile. Mouthfeel is very wet, wheaty, and quenching before being puntucated by a peppery dryness, especially at sides of the palate. I had a bit of difficulty describing the actual complexities, but this is most drinkable.

The nose presented a light lemon/orange citric peel spritziness, spiced with coriander...nice but could use more flair and oomph. The taste was light on the palate as well. A quenching grapefruity lightly acidic base emited shy accents coriander as the aggresively bittered dry citric finish engages the taste buds. The finish is quite clean leaving only light traces of lingering citric peel/coriander essence. The beer succeeds in the quenching/refreshing department. While the upfront flavor is a bit lacking in intensity, the finish was very well done for the style. I felt the body was a tad thin, though it was smooth to the touch.

Decent mouthfeel, especially with the tingly feeling all of the spice gives. Overall, though, I'm not really a fan.

Tons of musty yeast worked in with a bit of a bready finish. The taste was refreshing yet filling with a harvesty wheat flavor and just a slight bit of cloves and orange/lemon to give it a proper spice for a autumn eve. Mouthfeel was much thicker and creamier with just as much carbonation. I think I am starting to see what others do in this beer.

Vibrant combination of orange peel and sweetly herbal coriander dominates the aroma, although a tepid clove undertone adds a mildly phenolic contrast. Mellow yeast must and banana esters surface as the beer warms. Well rounded and judiciously spiced aromawise. Brusque snap of bready sweet malt initially in flavor yields to a soft melange of curacao bitterness, gentle clove, and a balmy, lemon like acidity. Residual sweetness augments as it warms as does the subtle banana ester component, eventually lending an agreeable, mellow banana bread impression late. Lightly bodied overall, but pleasantly viscous, and slightly silky from both the suspended yeast and oat glucans. Finishes mostly clean, with fleeting hints of candied lemon and freshly ground coriander. Allagash White is a superbly spiced wit that sits very softly on the palate. A bit tame in yeast derived character, but highly enjoyable and tasty nonetheless. Spot on.","marc77","Oct 06, 2003"

The body is quite robust for the style, and zippy citric acid flavors pop up and sting the sides of the tongue. Very forceful in the way of coriander with the orange influence hiding in the background, and showing its self in the way of orange zest. All in all a nice balance of flavors.

First off, I tasted this while sitting on my roof in the sun, and I feel that such summer doldrums invariably help any witbier review. The beer pours a hazy golden, darker than Hoegaarden, lighter than Whirlwind, with noticeable haze and yeast. Smell of light citrus and stong spice, (corriander) sneak through a thick smell of yeast. The first taste is, well, amazing. The flavors are complex, with a certain bit of sweetness in the beginning that quickly gives way to a spicy aftertaste. There's orange/lemon zest, vanilla, clove, nutmeg, corriander, and pepper to name a few. The taste is incredibly refreshing, and this beer has a lot more life to it than other whites, as there is strong carbonation in the form of miniscule bubbles that rise to the top. Head retention is not there, as the initial 1" quickly fades to a thin lacing, yet the lacing is immovable from the sides of the glass when drank and dissapates only after 10 minutes or so. The beer is the highest review I've given, and deservingly so. I'd prefer this to Hoegaarden or a list of other Belgians Wits any day. Great job on this one.","99bottles","Aug 01, 2003"

The coriander is distinct, but you have to swirl the glass to bring out more of the orange and citrus peel. Quite vibrant! A very fine and gently effervescent natural carbonation gives it an initial crispness on the tongue before it softens into silky smoothness. The body is light and it's immensely refreshing. The flavor displays a softly sweet and lightly tangy wheat malt that's accentuated by gently acidic citrus fruitiness and delicate zesty spices that slowly build on the palate.

Had a good body  steady, centered, and tasty - as well as decent hops. In time, it took on a creamy tasting finish that was fairly long and dry.

Floating around in the background of the aroma is a slightly biscuity aroma from the malt that only complements the beer overall. The flavor of Allagash white is a great example of the style yet they really throw in their own flavor into this beer. It combines the spices, slight lemon zing, hop bitterness, and earthy yeasty tones to form an extraordinary balance of flavors.

4.58,10.4,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a most refreshing and wonderful American version of a Belgian Wit Beer. Perhaps a bit more malty and hoppier than it's Belgian cousin (but it is brewed for the U.S. market). The tap version is a bit crisper and fruitier than the bottle version IMHO. Also beware that servers (even in beer bars) like to serve this one with a wedge of lemon.","purplehops","Mar 19, 2003"
4.13,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Very crisp and tingly. The start is bready with a lot of yeast. Towards the end, you get a lot of bananas. I expected there to be a blast of citrus in there somewhere, but it was nowhere to be found. I found this to be unique for the style. It had enough to it as it was. Very refreshing brew that really smoothes out after the carbonation dies out a bit. Don't miss this one.","ElGuapo","Mar 17, 2003"
3.25,-21.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Allagash White: In twelve ounce bottles. If you are looking for an orange flavored beer, you’ve found the beer! Cloudy golden beer. Not a whole lot of head; what there is tends to cling to the side of the glass. Initial taste is remarkably of yeast, which sweetens up to a pronounced orange flavor. Crispy and carbonated. The aftertaste is more of orange marmalde and a little bit of crispy toast. Not a bad beer, but there are better in the style.","jackndan","Mar 14, 2003"

An exceptional summer beer. Less sweet than Hoegaarden to which I compare it favorably.

Very effervesent with many tiny little bubbles. The smell is sweet orange, citrus and corriandor. The taste is very similar. Citrus, lemon, corriandor, pepper and some yeasty flavors. Better on draft than in the bottle in my opinion.","CharlesRiver","Feb 06, 2003"

On the palate the flavor consisted of more citrus flavors, lemon, and orange peels, spiciness, coriander, and some pear like fruitiness. The finish is sort of dry. This is very drinkable for a wit style I dont much care for","WilliamPhilaPa","Dec 23, 2002"

The nose citrus fresh, hints of coriander, quite sweet and pleasing to the senses, start is lightly sweet, the top skinny in feel. Finish bitingly acidic, middling on the hops and quite dry. A very nice representative to the Wit style, quite a pleasure to quaff.","Gusler","Dec 21, 2002"
4.22,1.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Lightly carbonated mouthfeel, but ever so smooth. Not as spicy as other Wits, but the subtle hop flavor balances very well with the spices that are in there. A very nice Belgian Wit...there is a good reason this is Allagash's flagship.","IrishRedRock","Dec 19, 2002"
4.01,-3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Cloudy pineapple juice color, huge 1 1/2 inch sugar crystal head with big bubbles in the middle. Fruity smells, malty with some citrus, to be sure. Light-bodied with subtle flavors, floats in the mouth and lends some traces of honey and ginger as the carbonation works its way down. Dryish finish, fairly abrupt and brought on by light hops. This is not a huge beer, but tamer and less astringent than I expected. Works as a bubbly, lighter-flavored Wit, and lacks some of the unpleasant aspects of some, to my tastes.","ADR","Dec 10, 2002"

Smells of citrus, coriander and mild hops. Flavors of lemon and orange seem to entice the taste buds first, followed by the spiciness of coriander. All the while, still tasting the mild undertones of yeast and hops. Left a pleasant after-taste, which didn't seem to hang around for too long. All-in-all and absolutely exceptional brew.","Scooter77","Nov 24, 2002"

The aroma is of yeast and malt, with a straw component in the background.  The taste is heavy with coriander and yeast, with some wheat flavors and a subtle sweetness.  The finish still seems to have some noticable hops as well.  The mouthfeel is good, but nothing exceptional.  This beer is enjoyable to drink, but not a truly memorable beer.","aaronh","Oct 27, 2002"

Foamy, rich, full head, laced down the glass perfectly. Smell was a combination of faint orange peels, coriander kick, and other less pronounced spices. Taste is right on for the style. Citrus, spicy, midly carbonated. Heavier than anticipated, yet very refreshing. I actually prefer this to the Hoegarrden version. Slightly more full bodied and a better finish. A very good beer, one of my favorites, and worthy of a special ocassion.","StevieW","Sep 20, 2002"
