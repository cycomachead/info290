"Excellent Beer, a Spring Classic, and well deserving of being the permanent Spring Beer for Sam Adams from 2004-2010. Thank God they brought this back in the Cold Snap they've introduced, with a little extra spices. Always loved this one, was devastated when it taken away from being the main Spring Seasonal"

"Feel good on the tongue, not too dry. Very refreshing, yet tasty at the same time. Still excellent in a bottle, but better on tap."

"Bottle while relaxing and watching the Super Bowl. Pours light yellow, slightly hazy, with a fluffy white head. Not much aroma on this, what is there is hay and maybe a bit of light fruits. Flavor comes in as a bit watered down, some yeast, a few hitns of pear or apple. Easy drinker, with barely any real belgian yeast or spice that i would be looking for with the style. Nice to have the option from SA, but pretty mediocre."

"I think this beer is okay to drink, and would be really refreshing in the summer with it's soft citrus profile and slight musty hop profile."

"O- Out of any Sam Adams brews I've tried to date, this one disappoints a bit. It's not that it's a bad beer, but I think it's an underwhelming brew for what I was expecting and I know it can be brewed with more umph! Still, it is an easy drinking wheat ale that I wouldn't have any issues with enjoying at any time and think it's well suited to anyone getting into the style."
"Bottle, pours a hazy yellow color with pretty nice head that fades into lacing on the glass as you drink. Very carbonated beer, smells of fruits, spice, malts and yeast. Tastes much the same, overall a little bready and thin with an overpowering citrus/orange peel and spice flavor that seems to be a little overbearing. Nothing special here, I’ll stick to the Belgian brews."
"O-It's nice. a good blue moon alternative if you're trying to slowly pull people away from macro"
"I think I was expecting a little more richness to the additional flavors, but I was satisfied with it as a beer."
"Poured a hazy golden brown, with moderate carbonation, and a nice frothy white head. Some sediment visible in the glass. Crisp citrus in the aroma. Crisp taste, wheat, citrus zest, coriander, and some peppery spice. A little bit stale and bitter though. Light-medium mouthfeel, somewhat drinkable; an okay wit."
"Bottle pours a golden color with a slight haze. Medium white head that doesnt stick around for too long. Sublte citrus fruit and spice aromas. Coriander. Flavor is pretty much the same. Orange and citusy fruity flavors with a slight Belgian spice and wheat flavors. Light to medium mouthfeel. Smooth and refreshing."
"Again, minimally tart and refreshing - good mouthfeel, smooth finish with good carbonation - a good beer."
"Feel is very unlike SA beer. It’s very distracting and ultimately almost ruins the beer. Otherwise it’s a fairly good tasting beer but lacks in aroma and feel."
"A decent beer, I enjoyed it"
"Its Sunday night after a tough loss on the ice....lower right back is tender from a spill....needed some bottle of healing....so I am trying hte White Ale...working off a mixed 12pck. The White ale is a yellow unfiltered beer with decent carbonation and white head that seems to be lacing nicely. The nose is very subtle, but I sensed orange peel and some spice. The taste is typical of most witbiers...there is a tingling of the buds from the spices they brewed the beer with then is ome off the pallete nice a crisp. A decent beer for after hockey. Mouthfeel is fine...not sure I would session this beer because I am not that big of fan of Witbiers. Sammy A did another fine job with this one!!!!"
"Not a lot in the way of Belgian aromas; almost pilsnerish, actually. Lightly sweet, gentle noble hops, very gentle Belgian yeast character. Tastes OK if uninspired. Kinda of a hybrid between Stella and a mildly hopped pils. Not a bad beer at all, but this style can bring a lot more to the table."
"Pours with a quickly dissipating head that leaves only a thin layer of foam in its wake. Beer is a pale golden with aslight amount of haziness. Aroma is a bit off-putting, with an odd chemically presence, slightly reminiscent of disinfectant that I have notices in other SA products. Taste reflects this odd presence as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but has a decent level of carbonation. Overall, I was very disappointed in this effort, and had a similar reaction as I did when I sampled SA's Coastal Wheat."
"Drinking this as i review it. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. not much head to speak of, and what little head there was, dissapeared quickly. The nose very malty, with a hint of smoke in it. mouthfeel is very good, its very creamy. This beer is moderately bitter, but mainly sweet. The beer's appearance is very cloudy, and golden yellow. i'm tempted to call it a mix between amber and yellow. could be more carbonation. Overall, its an ok beer, not sam's best though"
"Overall, this is a decent beer, definitely something to drink on a hot day, but nothing to really make you sit up and proclaim this an amazing beer."
"Very good brew again from the BBC."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but isn’t really that refreshing or thirst quenching."
"O – Nice flavors, but the mouthfeel could use a little work."
"A decent beer for when you want a little flavor but aren't looking for a flavor bomb. I'm a little perplexed as to why BBC are making this a fall/winter seasonal, as it seems more like something suited for spring."
"O: I would buy this beer again. It's an easy drink and wheat beers don't tend to overpower. The alcohol is barely present and the spice blend is solid"
"D - Simple and straightforward... Easy drinking and rather sessionable... Not an overly remarkable Witbier, but yet another solid member of the Samuel Adams line-up... I would have no trouble throwing back a couple of these, though it would be my first choice for a wheat based brew..."
"This white ale pours out as a cloudy opaque yellowish gold color. There a small amount of sediment in the bottle after the pour. The aromas are slightly floral and grainy. The taste of this beer is a little bit of citrus upfront that fades into the wheat back bone. There is a little bit of some wild flower type of thing in there too but very mellow. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbonated. This is a decent but very drinkable white ale."
"D/O- Pretty easy drinker here (read: somewhat bland). Label says it's brewed with ""unusual spices""...didn't get out of it, coriander perhaps. Crisp, clean..would be a great 6 pack night in the summer with some friends when the focus wasn't on the beer. Does this happen anymore? ;)"
"D - Easy drinking, but light on flavour."
"O: Not bad, not great, just in between. I could have used tons more funkiness overall. This one was a safe attempt."
"Taste is a little on the sweet end, and the orange really stands out here. Again very herbal, with a tarragon aftertaste. A good amount of carbonation makes this refreshing but doesn't take over the beer. Good springtime beer."
"Overall, a good offering. One of my favorites from SA."
"drinkability: i must really be in the mood for this one. best thing ive had from sam adams hands down."
"It doesn't seem like a traditional witbier to me, but its real nice whatever it is."
"Overall: A decent witbier, and a good offering from Sam Adams, but there are better ones out there. Makes a good session beer, feels very appropriate to Spring time, just as the weather is finally getting warm."
"d - An average witbier at best; nothing really stood out to me about it. Could drink a few of them but not sure I'd want to. Not one of SA's better beers."
"Overall: A decent interpretation of a witbier."
"overall this is a barely less than average wit - i guess i'd compare it to blue moon or something to that affect...nothing special"
"One of the better American takes on the belgian witbier."
"Tasty and an easy drinker, and better than a Blue Moon."
"I'd probably have this again if it was on sale, but I don't know if I'd actively seek it out."
"Finish: Light Grassiness and thats about it"
" P.s. my beer is gone and my glass still has pretty lacing all over it."
"D: This beer is easy to drink and is quite refreshing. It's a decent beer and I might purchase this again."
"I do not taste the exstravigant flavors that some reviewers aledge to."
"Pours a very lite golden-yellow. A white head sticks around a bit. Bunches of carb trailers. Looks good for a wit! Smell is slightly skunky, opening up to a mild potpourri of spices. Taste starts of on the bitter end, and opens up into more citrusy territory, before finishing dry and bitter again. Kind of overwhelmed by the variety of spices, but nice complexity. Tasty wit, I'd drink it again."
"M/D: Very drinkable. I would even say refreshing and its 9:30 at night!!! I think this is a nice offering for what it is...a lighter spring beer that still has some flavor. Im not hating on this bad boy."
"Overall: Like most Sam Adams brews, this is a good beer and a faithful interpretation of the style but is not necessarily the best example. Definitely an enjoyable and easily drinkable brew, I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Overall: Not the best wit I've ever had. Inoffensive enough, but just too thin and lifeless."
"Piss poor for the style, really nothing enjoyable about it. The combination of uncharacteristic sweetness and excessive spicing make this pretty hard to choke down."
"It's a good beer and decent representation of the style."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-/C"
"D: Tasty -I like it; a pretty good wheat beer -easy to drink."
"MF- Medium bodied with good carbonation with flavors that linger."
"overall it is kind of a let down. I understand it is an ""American"" version of a Belgian style. I just don't think it is well represented of the witbier its classified aswell."
"D-Why is this beer in both the Winter and American Originals packs? It is a very boring, bland beer."
"A nice beer and great in the sampler packs that Sam Adams graces us with although also worthy to but it on it's own. Sam Adams did a pretty good job trying to copy the Belgian white ale style."
"D - Quite a drinkable beer, either on its own or as a session."
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This was a very light golden color and it was very cloudy. A think white creamy head appeared, about 2 finger widths of head. Good lacing. A nice aroma that had a smell of wheat,lemon and coriander. The body and mouthfeel is light. This is a average example of a witbier. I hate to say this but I would have to give Blue Moon the nod over this one."
"Sam adams white ale is a good beer it is a cloudy golden color with white head that fades fast and ok lacing its has an aroma of citrus and spices, and taste is maltly sweet with a little bite at the end p, pretty good body to this beer to make for a little above average feel. Overall this isn't a bad brew but its definitely not my favorite or the best from sam adams but it worth a go"
"While this beer is no Allagash White, it is definitely one of the better Wits that has ever graced my palate. Honestly I just assumed this would be a throw away beer in the mixed twelve, as it seemed out of place. I am pleased to say that it is a pretty tasty beer and while it is an odd choice for a selection that bridges the gap between winter and spring, it is pretty darn tasty."
"12 oz into a snifter...Samuel Adams produces a fine lager and a fine pilsener, but once they get into ales, it seems like it is all fails. This white ale is no exception. The spicing is flat, the malt is kind of boring and there's not too much to it except a decent look. The yeast is wrong too. Was hard to finish the glass and I considered pouring it out but don't like to waste beer so finished it. Came as part of a sampler pack. Avoid this one, there are so many better white ales out there."
"Drinkability: Very light, and would be easy to drink throughout the night."
"Very drinkable spring time beer. At ~5%ABV could a have a few."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Enjoy before May notched on the label. Pours a pale, honey-orange with a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, half inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a mostly consistent skim. Not much happening in the nose - faint citrus rind and a trace of coriander. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a slightly bready character. Mouthfeel is light with a lively carbonation, a kiss of citrus astringency and a semi-dry finish. A decent Witbier, albeit somewhat lackluster. Can't touch the Belgians, but I wouldn't turn one down on a warm day."
"Taste: Starts out with a slight fruity taste that is followed by a bread and spice flavor. The flavor fades fairly quick."
"D: Very drinkable. Relatively low ABV. Very flavorful, but not overly rich."
"D: It's a white ale with no off flavors. Not especially interesting, but still quite drinkable."
"D - I doubt I'll have this again anytime soon."
"D - Very drinkable, nice change from the typical Sam Adams beer."
"No doubt about it, Sam's White Ale isn't a top example of the style -- Hoegaarden remains the kind -- but it's a solid example that manages to be very drinkable while also be somewhat tasty. Snobs will scoff, newbies will love it, and old vets will find it to be an impeccable session beer."
"D - Not bad. Very good warm weather beer."
"This white ale hits the spot. It's a style I'd expect to be very drinkable though. Once the temperatures turn up, it would be easy to spend a night with these, but I can't argue with the choice to go with Noble Pils. This was probably getting crushed by Blue Moon, and I'd probably even take that over this. Simple thirst quencher, but nothing to seek out."
"Notes: Recommended. I really enjoy this brew. The spiciness adds a pleasing and unique dimension (not that other beers aren't spiced. This combination just seems to work well)."
"Peppery grains of paradise, citrus rind coriander and a musty poundcake sweet malt aroma. Smooth, almost creamy body with a crisp, wheaty snap in back. Orange citrus and lemon shortbread with a dry finish."
"D=Definitely sits light in the stomach, very drinkable."
"D - pretty drinkable, not great, but it does taste pretty good and goes down easy."
"Drinks average. Other than the winter samplers, I certainly wouldn't seek this one out."
"Mouthfeel is light and creamy, with low carbonation and an almost watery feel from the light body. Drinkability was just alright for me as this beer was good, but nothing special as I find most Witbiers; it's just not a style I'm crazy about."
"D: Not out of the ordinary, but really well done. Not the most traditional and rustic look, however the flavor is spot on. Some might consider it a sort of entry-level or starter Wit. I actually like this far better than heavily done-up versions. Very drinkable."
"Samuel Adams White Ale thoroughly unimpressed me. Way to bland for my taste. Would not recommend or purchase again."
"Overall - As I remembered from years past, I used think this was a pretty bad interpretation of a wit, but this one wasn't bad. More phenolic than I remember and less cloyingly sweet on the finish. Is it possible that they have modified the recipe or yeast? I would say that it was much better than I had expected."
"An other un-exciting, un-inspired, par-for-the-course, brew from Sam Adams. Although they are known to experiment with some of their limited releases, this variety pack of classic styles I've been working through draws neatly between the lines. This guy is boring, but as always, absolutely unoffensive. I'd gladly drink it if it was around, but I am not going out of my way for it."
"Pours hazy straw color with a slight orange tint and a tight white head. Not getting a whole lot of smell from this one, but what I do get is grainy sweetness with only the slightest hint of tart/funky yeast. Taste is heavy on wheat and grain notes. The malt profile is cereal-like, and there are some good citrus notes in the background. There's a tingling tartness on the front and bottom of the tongue. Very smooth. It's one of the easiest-drinking beers I've ever had. Sam Adams did a pretty spot-on job with this one. I'd maybe like a little bit more of the yeast in the flavor, but that's just personal preference. All in all, a solid offering."
"A pretty good beer, and one I would drink again!"
"Pours a light golden honey color. Two finger lacing and some spider web lacing. Good looking witbeer. Smeels of citrus and malt. Ditto on the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is high. Would definitly buy this again. Very good beer. Good example of the style."
"Pretty good beer but there are plenty of better wits out there. Very approachable beer if you enjoy other Sam Adams brews."
"Overall a great utilitarian Wit. Nothing to ponder, just gulp and grin. A very good rendition of the style's texture and appearance, just wished there was a bit more presence of tart/citrus notes in the flavor. Good brew for the soft days of springtime for sure."
"Mouthfeel is rather thin but a bit lively on the tongue. Overall, I wouldn't call this the best white ale on the market, but it can hold its own."
"Don't know if there was a change in the recipe over the last few years but i'm a lot happier with this one. Overall it's not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to get this but getting a few in mixed packs is fine by me."
"It may no longer be the spirng seasonal, but it has enough redeeming qualities to remain in the BBC stable."
"D: With some other disappointments from the Sam Adams Winter Box, I'm quite ok with this. I don't think its completely true to style, but it is a good drink I'd recommend to any of my casual drinking friends."
"Poured a nice cloudy golden color with a nice head. Also kept a nice lace throughout. It was bright with just enough carbonation. I could smell the spices as stated on the bottle. I wish the taste was a little stronger, but overall it had a good taste, with the spices showing through again. Although I couldn't put my finger on exactly what the spices tasted like. It definitely was not a citrus taste, more like clove maybe, slightly bitter and more grassy tasting. Was balanced and easy to drink. Left no aftertaste."
"D- Not really my cup of tea (or glass of beer more accurately)"
"Overall-- not a bad attempt at the style, but no where near the top of the pack."
"D - I could drink several for sure, its light and non aggressive without the light-beer feel"
"Overall this is a solid white ale offering from SA. Nice and light, crisp, refreshing and easy to drink. I could drink quite a bit of this in the Oklahoma summer time, great beer to have sitting outside having a bbq!"
"D: Well done. Drinks well at a range of temperatures and is complex enough to enjoy, understated enough to serve with food, and just light enough to be refreshing."
"Good stuff, not quite a Belgian Wit but rather drinkable."
"the mouthfeel is light and drinkability is high overall a decent example of the style"
"Pours a golden light amber, head is impressive and is bright white and pillowy. Lots of lacing. Smells a little bit grainy, yeasty, smells like a wheat beer. Taste surprised me. More flavor than I thought, spices are apparent but do not dominate, yeast and carbonation do a good job of making this a very drinkable white ale."
"Overall I was quite a bit let down by this one. Would not pick this one up again, was waiting for the ""unusual spices"" and they just didn't show up."
"Taste, decent, a little chewier than expected, one of the more dense white ales. Lots of that clove spice you either love or hate usually. Lemon. Orange. Very carbonated. Not my favorite beer out of the variety pack by far."
"1 failure (White Ale)"
"D: Low. This is not very good at all. However, I could see its appeal to a mostly BMC crowd, which might excuse its inclusion in an otherwise great winter sampler pack."
"D: Easily drinkable and a pretty tasty brew"
"D) A decent Witbier. I'd have another."
"Verdict: Not a bad wheat beer. Pretty good balance of flavor and everything is light and meshes well. Another decent Samuel Adams brew."
"D-I've had better alt beers than this. Too carbonated for me. Finishes a little too dry.Not something I'ld go out of my way for."
"A pretty decent witbier, definitely has that American wit feel like Blue Moon, it doesn't feel authentic. Not bad though it seems overly sweet."
"A slightly above average Wit. Good balance between ingredients. Amazing texture. Very smooth and creamy."
"This beer is a generic white ale, nothing bad about it, nothing really that great. I will say that it is better than the Sam Adams Coastal Wheat, which was not good at all. It has a nice wheat presence, and good citrus flavor, a nice color and the drinkability isn't bad, it's just an ok beer. Nothing to really talk about other than that, it's just an average wheat beer."
"Drinkability: Medium"
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass and it has a light pale orange color body with not a lot of head but a nice lace around the edge. The smell is of lemon and coriander. The taste is of nice wheat and citrus hops. It is nice a smooth off the tongue and leaves a nice after taste and is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Purchased in the Sam Adams Holiday Sampler. I feel like this is the changeup pitch thrown in with the bocks, porters, lagers, and winter warmers. A solid beer in its style but nothing spectacular. Would be more drinkable in warmer weather, say at the ballpark."
"D-one of my least favorite sam beer's to date. not undrinkable by any means for the style but lots of flaws and extremely simple in flavor."
"Hazy orange brew. White head with poor retention and minimal lacing. Fresh citrus aromas. Big citrus flavors, mostly orange but some mango and apricot are there as well. Acidic and slightly sour. Mild wheat flavors in the background. Minimal grassy hop. Medium in body, well carbonated and a creamy texture. Pretty standard for a wit but tasty and satisfying just the same."
"D: The hot peppery spiciness gives me a little heart burn feeling. So, one at a time is enough."
"for me this is another solid offering from the people at the boston beer company"
"Drinkability: pretty drinkable, but for some of the flavor irregularities. I prefer a little bit sweeter of a Witbier with less of a grainy aftertaste. This is not a bad beer, though."
"D-A very easygoing beer but this just isn't my style. I could see drinking a couple of these some afternoon, but I would use this beer in place of an American Adjunct Lager; something not very complicated that I don't have to think about while drinking."
"One of Sammy's best regular style beers along with the Noble Pils and a couple others I am forgetting."
"Drinkability: Decent brew in a different style. Real easy to drink, but I can tell you that every time I've had it I have been left somewhat underwhelmed. Worth a try at least, particularly if you are making the circuit of Boston Beer Company brews."
"D - This had decent drinkability. I think this would be a good beer to drink in the summer. It is certainly not the best witbier I've ever had, but it's a decent beer overall."
"Drinkability - This beer doesn't seem to pull of the traditional approach/mentality that BB usually caters to. I'm not tasting enough of the Belgian history. Decent tasting, but not terribly complex."
"Mouthfeel was soft and creamy. Overall, a pleasant beer, but not an offering that would otherwise classify as 'spectacular'; sublimely drinkable, more interesting than most, a worthy witbier from Sam's."
"D - If you want a beer that is quenching and crisp then this is for you. Fans of Witbiers should enjoy."
"Drinkability - based on taste alone, I wouldn't want more than one. Other than that, it is a pretty drinkable beer."
"D - Very pleasurable to drink. Tasty and easy to imbibe."
"It's a thin beer, not creamy at all, more crisp. Super easy to drink but with the interesting flavor profiles I'm not sure I'd want too many in a row."
"A solid, pleasant winter beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - It comes from the Sam Adams winter classics. Reminds me of an orange lemonade kind of a beer which I would enjoy drinking more during the summer. Either way, its a nice taste."
"Not a bad beer, Witbiers aren't exactly my thing so I'm not the best of judges. Refreshing and would be a good choice for warmer weather I believe."
"Pours a hazy goldenrod, although not terribly cloudy. Puffy bubbly lace on top is pretty close to pure white. Aroma is orange peel, yeasty, grainy. I guess there are spices there but only because the label says so. This beer doesn't taste like a whole lot - subtle fruit flavors, banana, lemon, not very wheaty, slightly tangy. Eh, this beer isn't bad but is entirely forgettable."
"D: A very enjoyable American Style Witbier. refreshing during any part of the year. An excellent beer to introduce folks to the world of TRUE refreshing beer"
"While not a phenomenal representation of the style, I enjoy this beer and glad its in the holiday packs."
"Light crisp mouthfeel. It's not going down the drain, but definitely an average beer."
"Body is good for the style and drinkability is OK, hurt by the chemical aftertaste"
"Notes: Well it's not too shaby but it's still tasty as it usually is. Cheer."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and sweet with a medium body. And very very easy drinkin'. Don't know why it's in the winter seasonal but it kinda fits."
"It's more complex than Blue Moon. I'm also getting some floral notes reminiscent of Boston Lager paired with the citrus flavor. Slightly doughy aftertaste. It's balanced well though all around. Overall, I'd recommend you try this if you're a fan of the style and I can't wait to try the other Winter Classics beers. Merry Christmas!"
"Drinks pretty smooth with a lot of fruity citrus and it is very bubbly. This was a nice refreshing beer for the spring time but this is just as good as a winter."
"My 12-ounce glass went to capacity and threatened to spill over before creating a magnificent one-finger, mushroom-like cap of off-white head with good retention. Color was a golden yellow that was as foggy as my mind after this afternoon or Washington, D. C.'s Bottom. Nose struck me as more hoppy than spicy, although I suddenly started sneezing, which suggests black pepper, which suggests coriander. In a Winter Sampler?!? Moving on, the mouthfeel was big, full, and rather thick. Given that I have sensed this in every beer this afternoon, I wonder if it is not something to do with the proprietary yeast strain. Yum, good. Finish was vinous bone-dry, like some white wines. Phew. Still, it did not remind me of l'Hiver."
"To confirm that I didn't have a bad bottle, I opened up the second one a day later... still bad. Drain pour."
"Drinkability: A decent wit, certainly better than other mass-market witbiers, but not at the top of its class."
"d - An average witbier; nothing really stood out to me about it. Could drink a few of them but not sure I'd want to. Not one of SA's better beers."
"D: This would be an OK summer refresher. Why it was placed in the winter sampler, I have no idea."
"This beer is good. I have had others with more to offer, flavors of pepper and grains of paradise as well as lemon, grapefruit and banana. This one I like less than other craft brewers, more than all the macro versions. Tastes like a Sam Adams brew."
"M/D: a bit mellow for a witbier but considering the intended audience, I would say it has a good and light feel and improved drinkability for the mass craft market."
"All in all, a decent, but not great beer, both in style and all-around. I wouldn't be going out of my way to buy it, but it's not a bad beer. Definitely would rather have this in the spring than the winter."
"Part of the Winter mix pack. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy pale gold. A thin white head rest atop. Fair retention; left some good lace behind. The nose is pretty basic. Some light spices, wet hay, citrus zest. Smooth feel, with a crisp bite on the finish. Some faint citrus like lemon and orange in the flavor. More bready than anticipated. This isn't one of the more spicy Wits out there, but it hits the spot. Also, I'm not sure this is the season for this style, but no matter. A good beer, just not necessarily a good Witbier."
"D - Drinks easy, very bland and plain. Could easily drink a few... but not going to seeing I only got two in the 12 pack winter special."
"Overall/notes: Witbier is a relatively popular style, what with Blue Moon and Hoegaarden's success. They knew this when the brewed the beer, and it shows. I wouldn't say it's a brew for the extremists, but if you're looking for a good one to kick back with while chatting it up, this'll do."
"{Slight revision with re-tasting in Sept. 2011)"
"I got this in their winter variety case. Pours a cloudy copper orange. The nose is nice. Smell of wheat and citrus and a bit of yeast as well. The taste however, misses for me. Really, I only get citrus up front with lingering sweetness. Otherwise, the body is real thin. If it wasn't for the good carbonation, this one would be an epic fail. Not totally bad, but I would buy a whole bunch of these."
"D Solid drinkability"
"Tried it on tap in a bar. The beer is hazy gold color. Aroma is citrus, yeast and some spice. Body is light to medium. The tartness is pronounced. Flavor of citrus and spice with a touch of banana. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers but this one I would try again."
"D: Overall very drinkable. Not quite a beer to ponder but a very good American Wheat. Not overly spiced like some of the macro-brewed wheats (Blue Moon, Shock Top)"
"M/D: Crisp and easy drinking, but overall not amazing. Its not bad, but just didn't have it."
"Everything about this is mediocre. Ill drink it in the samplers, but that's about it. Definitely could be worse though."
"(D)- A decent witbier. Some off flavors, but otherwise enjoyable and easy to drink. Not really what I would want for the wintertime however, so I find the name and time of the year this is released rather odd. This is more fitting the spirng/summertime better."
"D: Crisp and smooth, light, drinks easily. A good summer quencher, a pretty good take on a Belgian classic."
"Very good white ale, I've had a few better, but this more than meets my expectations for the style and would be a great session beer."
"The beer pours a hazy golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma is orange, pepper, coriander and something that resembles cough syrup. The flavor is juicy oranges with some grass and coriander mixed in. The flavor is syrupy and is very sweet overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, but not one of the better Samuel Adams beers."
"D - would be a good summer quencher, I still don't know why this made it in the winter sampler"
"From bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy gold color. Soft hoppy/citrus scent. Tastes like a very citrusy wheat beer. Very citrus feeling to it almost like drinking a sprite. First beer I've had of this style can't wait to try more like it and can't wait to tell my friends about this one."
"A good winter beer, and very drinkable during the holiday season. This really tastes more like an IPA than a witbier."
"Overall: Good beer overall. This isn't something I would expect to be included in a winter sampler. I think it would make an excellent summer beer. Definitely worth trying."
"A good introduction beer to the wit style. The beer has the traditional flavors of a wit but quite subdued."
"Drinkability: You can drink it...but it's not a very good example of a Witbier. Too heavy, unnecessarily bitter."
"Drinkability: An good witbier. Better than many But not outstanding. My favorite aspect of the beer is the apriclot taste."
"A decent beer, but not something I would buy if others were available."
"D: Chuggable, if that's your thing ;)"
"D: Decent. Aftertaste got old after a while."
"Drinks like a champ. Only downfall is the Sam Adams patented ""CLOY""-ality."
"D - Other than the Chocolate bock I enjoyed this one second most of the variety pack. Something about citrus and yeast in an American beer that just clashes great in this. Loved it."
"D-Very drinkable, incredibly smooth, easily a session beer"
"This isn't what I'd expect from a winter beer but is still nice. Its a much lighter one and fits in nicely with the other Sam Adams seasonals."
"Slightly hazy, straw yellow to copper color; minimal, fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Bright wheat aromas, refreshingly malty and some lemony citrus notes. Flavor mostly of wheat malt, maybe a touch of coriander and citrus. Crisp and clean tasting, but lacking in any depth. Light to medium bodied, mostly dry. Good beer, but what is it doing in the Sam Adams' winter pack?"
"D - Very drinkable beer. The flavors are nice and smooth and balanced, even with the fairly light body. The finish could be a bit more balanced, but the fruity/spicy combination is nice."
"DB- Pretty enjoyable witbier. My only gripe is it does feel somewhat straightforward or cheap for some reason. The flavors feel separated rather than melded into a smooth experience."
"Drinkability- the bitter orange ending wants more."
"Not quite sure how this ended up in their winter seasonal mix pack, but I'm not really going to complain. I don't consider it a winter brew, but I love wheat beers enough to drink them year round. It's a nice change of pace from the rest of the pack, though it could stand to be more flavorful."
"D- Certainly easy to drink but I was expecting more kick to it. Overall good, really smooth beer. Probably wouldn't buy a six pack of but its ok."
"Perfectly clear grade A honey color with a 1.5"" white head that diminished quickly, leaving a scant ring, but laced very nicely while it lasted. A strong pilsner malt aroma (that characteristic breadish smell), quite a bit of metallic tones here. I could be confusing this with citrus notes, but regardless, it's a tiny bit off putting. Very light coriander as well, touch of honey. Overall aroma is delicate, but decently balanced. Flavors are well melded and coincide with the aroma, but without the metallic tones and more of the bready, cereal malt notes in the finish. Somewhat of a light/medium body, perhaps a little heavier than I'd like in a witbier, but well carbonated and crisp. I just drank both of them in about a 40 minute time span, so I'd say it's pretty drinkable. Not something I'd buy in a 6 pack. It happened to be in the variety pack so I decided to drink them."
"From a bottle with an expiration date of March 2011. The pour is a milky pale yellow with busy carbonation but virtually no head to speak of. The aroma is thin but exhibits a citrus, doughy character. There was little in the way of wheat. The body comes in at about medium. The taste is mild with more of a wheat-like base, vague spices, and thin hops. Drinkable enough but nothing overwhelming."
"D-high, if one were to session with a witte, this would be it...."
"The aroma has a bit of funk or maybe adjuncts because there is a card board quality to it. There is also some citrus and malt but they seem to be hidden. The appearance is amber gold with a medium head but not cloudy enough for a white ale. The taste is like the aroma with a better finish and a funkier taste up front. The palate is average. Overall a drinkable beer."
"D - Not bad really, the spices work better in the flavor than they do in the aroma. All I get from the smell is musty hay and a little spice, but the flavor has more citrus and some nice peppery notes. There are some hops in the finish that keep things balanced and work pretty well with the pepper. This is not my favorite style, but I have to admit that it is a pretty decent attempt. The aroma has some room for improvement, but overall it is really better than I ever gave it credit for."
"This slightly cloudy beer produces a one finger head when poured. Lacing is minimal, with moderate cling. Color is a 6 on the SRM color chart. Aromas of lime, orange, wheat, and corn. Flavors are many and seem to change with each sip. I detect orange, lime, vanilla, black pepper, cinnamon, wheat, and malt. Not bad feeling in my mouth, would like a little more, but not bad. I like the flavor, enchanting, and changing. Very refreshing and not bad on the wallet."
"Poured semi-aggressive into standard nonic for a 1-finger head that disappears into nothing. Carbonation is light, bubbles in the runny lacing are rather small. Color is cloudy straw gold with a punch of orange. Off the bat, aroma brings out an orange citrus that is found in Blue Moon, so I suppose an orange wedge would be an appropriate addition for those that prefer it. ""Brewed with spices."" Spices? Well, not in the aroma, other than light brown sugar. I would have expected some coriander; maybe it's there, I just don't smell or taste it. Other aroma of light wheat flavor is pleasant. Taste is bursting with orange peel and wheat. No other spices tasted. Probably a good session beer for wheat beer lovers. Light-bodied beer with a dab of sour aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel: Very light with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is reasonably high. It has more flavor than BMC and is incredibly sessionable, though not overly flavorful overall."
"D: This generally isn't my favorite style of beer which is why I tried this one first out of the Samuel Adams winter pack. But I was actually surprised and didn't mind it at all. There wasn't anything too overpowering. I won't mind having the second one out of the pack."
"Taste again is very classic, very well balanced and spicy with a nice yeast note to it that's crisp and quite dry on the finish. There's almost a peppery finish on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a pretty sharp carbonation that makes it crisp and easy drinking."
"A duller honey color with fine foamy head, mildly hazy. Soft bready aroma with some bananas and soft spices, aroma is faint. Taste is a little tart with a distinct spice finish, bananas and some grass apparent too. Pretty tasty overall, a totally decent winter wheat beer."
"SA White Ale from a 12oz bottle into a slender 16oz SA White Ale Witbier glass. Pours a golden hazy color thats highly carbonated with a very nice off white pillow 2 1/2"" head, decent retention and excellent lacing left on the sides. Smells kinda sweet with a nice citrus aroma of lemon and assorted spices. Taste like a somewhat weak wheat ale, and has the same vibe as the summer ale and coastal wheat, of which both I hate. Very clean mouth feel and taste despite all the spice going on here, the high carbonation probably helps push most of that aside. Overall a decent brew, but definatly doesn't deserve a spot in the SA winter classic's pack. Would recommend as a spring deal and especially to women looking for a lighter, more flavorful beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, cloudy yellow with a white head and plenty of carbonation. I love the aspect that its unfiltered. Powerful wheat, grainy, and lemon essence. It doesn't really do much for me, I cant see what makes this an ale besides that it was brewed with ale yeast, Its a step above a decent adjunct beer. I guess this is just not my style of beer, but I respect it for what it is."
"This beer pours a kinda of hazy golden color, with a small head that did stay through out the beer. It has a sharp wheat, and lemon smell. The taste is a gradual increase of the wheat flavors, and some lemon as well. Strong wheat taste. Very nicely carbondated, and easy to drink. This is how a wheat beer should taste like. Overall a really good beer. One of the better American witbiers out there. I would like to see this one maybe replace the summer ale."
"Pours a slightly hazy dull golden color with an averaged sized fizzy head. Head is white, dissipates quickly and leaves really no lacing to speak of. Scent is a bit of wheat and grainy notes with a lot of citrus peel scents. Taste is lots of citrus notes and an almost cloying sweetness with the wheat and grainy notes mostly in the background. Can't really taste any sort of spices outside of the citrus peels. Mouthfeel is also a bit lacking, doesn't have the effervescent kind of carbonation I expected. I feel like this one pretty much misses the mark in every category that defines the style."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date of Feb. Pours a murky straw color with strands of some kind of darker mass floating around the middle. Some lacing. Aromas of spice, grains, malts and lemon zest. A bit too much spice and a bit too floral for my taste. This is not a beer I will be drinking again. I guess I will have to choke it down if I grab another Winter Classics Mix Pack."
"D-A waste of time, calories, and money, considering it is such a poor representation of the style. Even outside of the classification this is a poor beer, and the worst of the winter box."
"This was part of the Sam Adams Winter Collection, and this is one that I would take to a holiday party and hope the other guests finish it."
"The spicing is spot on, but the rest of the beer could use something, namely a more assertive malt and yeast character."
"D- Love this one as well. It has no complaints. It doesn't stand out enormously, but it doesn't sit at an average brew either. I'd drink it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice in the Sam Adam's pack. The alcohol is not an issue, it doesn't add much to the conversation."
"Samuel Adams White Ale is a cloudy golden ale with a thick, dense, soft white head that has excellent retention and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has notes of lemon, fruit, spice and possibly wood. It has a pretty light body and is quite smooth and dry. The finish is dry and papery. It tastes fresh and lemony and reasonably bitter with a note of hay. There is a lingering, light grassy bitterness. It's a light and easy beer that's not entirely boring."
"I agree with the opinions that I have heard that this one is a curious addition to a winter sampler, but I rather enjoyed it. The appearance is only slightly cloudy, with a yellow-orange color and a foamy eggshell-colored head. The aroma presents a big banana character, with a hint of yeast and clove. The spiced character is more pronounced in the flavor, along with more of the light banana cream and mild yeast flavors that were noticeable in the aroma. The texture is finely carbonated but a little prickly, which doesn't quite mesh with the light, creamy flavors. Overall, I found this one light and pleasant, and I would happily have a few more."
"You know, it's fine, considering its origins (the brewery, I mean). Ain't a Hoegaarden, but I have a feeling it beats Blue Moon."
"d 3 no idea why this is in a winter sampler pack. (just to carry on the spicing theme?) a wit makes me think of summer mainly, but maybe i'm a wacko. nevertheless drinkable depending on the mood (not often in the mood for something like this though)."
"D: I cant say I'll be looking for another anytime soon. (but will finish this one!)"
"All in all, this one was a bit one-dimensional and disappointing. nothing memorable, other than the somewhat lackluster aroma and run of the mill flavor. Given most of the other Sam Adams offerings, I'm surprised by this one."
"Finally at the end of the Winter Styles pack. It pours a pretty clear amber-lemon topped by about a half-finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, coriander, wheat, light lemon, grass, flowers, very light cedar, and a touch of soil. The taste sides mostly with the citrus notes, particularly the orange peel, lemon zest, and coriander. Some earthy and floral hop notes find their way in there as well. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a partially watery feel. Overall, an OK wit, fairly solid in most respects, but just a tad too bland to really engage me, so to speak. Something like that."
"This beer wont knock your socks off, but it's a solid beer. Not sure why it's in the Winter mix pack though-it would be better off in a spring or summer pack."
"Final Notes: This should be more of a summer beer than a winter beer, so why they're doing it in the winter classics pack I have no idea. A decent witbier, but belongs in a different season."
"Taste of mostly coriander and orange peel among wheat malts and a light body. There is high carbonation and just a little bit of citrus mixing with pale wheat malts. Relatively straight forward and easily drinkable. This is a pretty good witbier, one that you could probably session if you felt in the mood for a wit."
"Drinkability: A pretty decent and flavorful witbier. Certainly not the best out there but still very enjoyable. I am a bit confused as to why BBC opted to include this in the winter mixed pack rather than the summer mixed pack but I think confusing decisions in these mixed packs are par for the course now. Glad I finally got to try it."
"This is not a bad beer, I won't go out of my way for it, but if it is in a sampler pack or given to me by a friend than I would drink it."
"D - Definitely a nice and drinkable wit. Nothing to exciting, just another very solid beer from BBC"
"Cloudy golden color with a large head that had excellant retention. Just a small amount of lacing is left behind. Aroma of orange zest and other citrus. Wheat malt really comes through in the nose as well. Not nearly as highly spiced as other wits. Mostly wheaty flavor with some faint citrus and spice. Nothing really identifiable. Quite boring by witbier standards. Light body and nicely carbonated. In the end this is a wit aimed at the masses. Nothing here to offend anyone but not enough to make it interesting either."
"D- Not bad. I would drink it again but wouldn't go down to the store to find it specifically."
"Na Zdravje!"
"2010--White Ale--Ale Brewed With Spices. (4.0 / 5.0) Wit--Unfiltered, thin sediment. Dense lacy lasting half inch rocky white head. Slightly hazy bright lemon gold color. Gentle orange peel coriander aromatic Belgian wheat ester front. Delicately sweet thin textured subtle Belgian American Wit smooth refreshing tasty body. Crisp clean mild citrus smooth tasty satisfying quenching well made nuanced Wit end. Sampled 11/17/2010 from Winter Classics Variety 12-Pack purchased for $13.99 at Fred Meyer in Ballard, Seattle.."
"The feel of this beer is light and is something of a late winter beer that gets you ready for spring and the warmer months. The spices give is a nice poppy flavor while the light body is a rest from other winter beers."
"Overall I thought this was an ok white ale, I tend to like my white ales heavier in the spice department. I wouldn't seek this beer out but would drink it if I was offered one. Overall a mediocre brew."
"D: Good drinkability, this is a nice wit. Nothing amazing but not shabby either. Better than a lot of other witbier's out there."
"Notes: Part of the 2010 Winter Pack. An above average beer that isn't a bad witbier, but there are definitely better ones. Stronger citrus for others in the style. Overall I thought this was nice, but if it were apart from the Winter Pack, I probably wouldn't get this on its own."
"Notes: Got this in the Sam Adams Winter Sampler. Why?"
"Overall, there are a lot of shortcomings for this beer as a white ale, but it's a pretty decent, totally drinkable beer."
"D: This ale exhibits nice balance, and is a nice counterweight to the overly spiced beers that appear this time of year."
"This beer reminds me of a mellow hefeweissen. It's tasty and refreshing, but a bit too fizzy for me."
"This is a solid beer."
"1285"
"SA White Ale pours with a solid inch of fluffy white head with a few minutes of retention and some nice lacing. Body is a hazy golden color. Smell is predominately zest (lemon / orange), as well as some wheat and spices I can't identify. The taste follows right in line with the nose - lemon zest, wheat, and a bit of pepper spiciness in the finish. Medium bodied, well carbonated, and a dry finish. Its a nice beer, I just wish it remained a spring release - would be really refreshing in early / mid May, but not having the same effect on me in the middle of November."
"My main complaint is that it is only in the winter pack. This is a very delicious beer...an underappreciated member of the winter pack from SA."
"I don't find this style all that appealing. I favor Hefeweizens. This particular example just doesn't pop, wow, or refresh."
"Drinkability: Just from personal opinion, I could put down a few of these on a summer day or even into fall, but this just doesn't seem to be a very drinkable brew in the winter; although it serves a great contrast to many of the seasonal beers during fall and winter. Very drinkable, I guess it would just depend on the mood I'm in."
"- The is a beer I find very drinkable and inviting to those who maybe don't get down with stronger/ more full bodied beers and styles such as imperial stouts and the like. I could drink this all day long, and would probably be happy to subside off of it for a week straight with pleasure. (Okay, that last part is a joke =P)"
"D - Pretty drinkable, would be better as a crisp Spring/Summer beer but I certainly won't turn it down now."
"D-about as close to a drain pour as possible, i just did not get along with this beer. Sam Adams, thank you for changing the spring seasonal to the noble pils, you still should've left this out of the winter package and never made this again."
"- Overall a light a refreshing brew with a nice background flavor to it.... why it's in the holiday pack I don't know... but this would be nice out on a boat fishing in the summer."
"D- Well balanced. Nothing overpowering. Its pretty tame and easy to drink. Smooth and crisp but nothing extraordinary."
"Overall: White Ale reminds me a lot of Summer Ale. Both beers are lighter wheat beers that share many of the same ingredients. White Ale tones the spice level down and seems to replace the lemon with orange. I think this beer balances the flavors out a bit better. Honestly, I wouldn't be able to tell these two beers from one another."
"Overall - It's okay, an odd choice I think for the winter variety pack, but not terrible. Standing alone, it's pretty average and I doubt I'd want another."
"Overall impression: Seems a little too spiced and ""artifical"" to be a true witbier. Still, the spice notes work well for the winter. A nice replacement to the Cranberry Lambic."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white foam head. The smell of this beer is lemon citrus, hops, coriander, wheat, and a hefty amount of grass. There is just too much earthiness for my liking. That continues in the flavor as well. The grass is toned down, but there is a pepper note that replaces it and continues to disappoint me. The feel of this beer is pretty good, crisp and bubbly on the tongue, maybe even too much so. The beer is good, but it's not nearly one of my favorites. Not the best beer from Sams by far, but it sure as hell isn't the worst. If you like earthy spice, I say go for it. If you don't I say pull something else out of the pack."
"D: This is an OK Wit in my book. The light body and low ABV make it an easy drinker."
"D- nothing I will probably buy again."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again.pretty good for a witbier"
"Nothing I'd pick out, but not a bad beer at all. Reminds me of the normal Blue Moon, although I'd say this is definitely better."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, and can be rather sessionable at times. Went good with a breaded Tilapia filet and vegetables, and I think it would be okay on its own. I could have another, but there are other witbiers I think I prefer over this one. Still, it's quite drinkable."
"The drinkability on this brew is solid. As stated above, as well as through other reviews present on thsi brew, its quite refreshing. If the carbonination isn't has strong on other bottles, this brew is a great session beer, when ever you want to enjoy it. A pretty decent brew by Samual Adams, once again."
"drinkability - this came in a winter sampler 12pack and i doubt i drink the other one"
"This beer was a huge surprise to me. Probably the best I've had of the style so far, and a beer I'd love to go back to if it were offered in six-packs during the summer."
"Orange, hop, citrus, a hint of nutmeg. A bit stale and yeasty. Little aftertaste and lightly carbonated."
"Smells like coriander with a fruity flowery smell. Reminds me of a way better smelling Blue moon. Taste way better too. This has a nice crisp bite to it with these nice spices mixing in with that cereal like wheat malt. I can definitely tell why this would be a perfect spring beer. Very light hops in the back taste of this too. Its good because although it has those spices and flower like flavors it still maintains a beer like quality to remind you its not just some straight spice drink. This sort of reminds me of Dogfish Head Namaste too but that had more orange taste fruity taste.... where this you can taste more wheat. Not complaining though its a very nice tasting beer."
"Don't let the White Ale part fool you, this witbier pours an amber color with a slight scent of wheat. It has a slight bitter taste like a pale ale but very small. The spices are very evident but blended nicely. Another great beer from Sam Adams."
"D - This is moving towards the top of my list of Wits. For me it has a good balance of flavor and goes down very easy. I'm a little bummed that it's only available in the Winter Pack."
"Overall, this really is a decent white ale. I would gladly buy it in a 12 pack if it ever resurfaces in the spring. Hoegaarden and St. Bernardus White remain my all time favorite white ales, but this is definitely one to check out."
"D: Easy drinking, although seems out of season. Probably better off during the spring where it used to be (although I do love me some Noble Pils). Like, but don't love it"
"I'm not crazy about these wheat dominant beers, but I think SA White Ale might be one of the better ones that I've had."
"Pours hazy orange peel color, with foamy white head. Nice aroma of cloves, citrus, some banana and also a bit of coriander. Nice flavor to this brew as it is typical of this style. However the strength of the flavors in this beer are not that impressive. Rather timid tastes of citrus and banana. Some clove in the taste as well but not much. Overall a nice easy to drink wheat, really easy to drink. However, it does leave a lot of room for improvement on the style, the flavors just are not quite as robust as some of the bigger wheat beers out there."
"Drinkability: Either despite or because of the subtle spicing, this is a very refreshing, balanced Witbier. Some think it is strange in the Winter Pack, and maybe it is, but it is a nice refreshing choice."
"Pours a pale yellow so clear that I can watch tv through the glass. The head is originally frothy and about an inch thick, but settles down quickly. The aroma is very citris like, with maybe some other spices present. The taste is overly citrusy. It tastes like a slightly malty lemonade more than a beer. Maybe better in a different seasonal, I'm not sure why this is in the winter mix pack with a bunch of malt forward beers. This reminds me more of the summer ale or the coastal wheat than anything."
"Pours a cloudy golden-straw color with a large white head. Scent is lightly spicy and a bit floral. A bit of lemon as well. Not a very powerful aroma. The taste is lemon zest with a bit of pepper. Light mint flavor as well. A little less complex than other witbiers. Don't get me wrong, this is still a tasty beer, it's just not super impressive. Mouthfeel is nice and not too light. Drinkability is fair."
"Drinkability: Not something I'd drink very often, but maybe twice a year. Sam adams brews are always a tad short on something. This beer is okay, but it lacks body and the complexity that I'd expect out of a witbier. This is a decent beer for the masses."
"D- not much too this brew. I know the flavor is meant to impact the brew. But there is not much to it"
"Drinkability - Very much so. Not a half bad wit and glad they ""unretired"" it, despite them putting it in the Winter pack. SA has been putting out some solid stuff lately. Can't wait to try the Chocolate Bock!"
"Recommended if you can find any remaining bottles since it's retired."
"Among wheat beers, these whites are prolific, so it's tough to stand out. This one doesn't either, but neither does it come in under the norm. That said, it drinks clean and smooth, quenching well. So maybe it could get lost in a crowd, but there are worse crowds to get lost in."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. It is an okay beer nothing stands out."
"Retired now apparently, I had thought this was coming after the Noble Pils, I guess the Noble Pils replaced it. While both are good, I'd prefer that SA had stayed with the White Ale to be honest."
"Wow, did they retire this one? Why?? It's really good. Yellow with a hint of orange maybe. Nice white head. Smells like malt and spice. Taste is a very nice wheat beer. Carbonation is just what it should be. I'm sorry they retired it. I'd like to have more of it."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, very crisp and drinkable. Very sad to see this one go."
"I'm basing my drinkability rating on the beer when it is fresh. I can't recommend keeping this one more than a couple of months past release. I've not yet tried the Noble Pils. I wasn't pleased to hear that White Ale was being replaced. I looked forward to the release of this delicious beer in the spring. I hope that it will again see the light of day and not be retired completely."
"d- gets old fast. not sure what it is, but it seems as though the ingredients just don't work together that well"
"Drinkablity: I am not a wheat beer fan but this brew from Boston Brewing is pretty tasty."
"This was a pretty decent beer, it was flavorful and refreshing. Though I wouldn't seek it out I wouldn't mind having it again."
"The smell featured a solid yeast element with undertones of coriander. The taste was spicy and wheaty with a definite yeast and coriander and clove flavor. The mouthfeel was full and mildly chewy. Overall a good drinkable white ale. Very sessionable."
"Pours burnt orange with a finger of white head that dissipates quick. Not a lot of sediment for a wit. Smells of coriander and orange peel. A lot of citrus. Taste of oranges and spice, some pepper. Nothing super special. Mouthfeel is tart and effervescent. Drinkability is good."
"Pours a semi-clowdy very light orange color with less than a finger head. The head receeds fairly quick to just a bit of lace on top of the beer and a tiny bit of lacing on the glass is evident as well. Initially the nose has a mild citrus aroma full of wheat and yeast. Carbination is a little low on this one and the mouthfeel is very light. Taste is minorly bitter with citrus/coriander up front. The finish is crisp. Very easy to drink and would be a wonderful session beer during a hot day."
"Cloudy gold color with mild prickle. Light foam head upon pouring into the glass. The head dissipates over time and leaves behind a wispy show of lacing. Malty nose with wheat like smell of grains. Refreshing attack, but flattish flavor. It really drops off once its in the mouth. Heavy grain presence in the flavor that underscores and effervescent mouthfeel. There are grain flavors at the finish and aftertaste. I think that this beer was too ""carbonated"" to fall into my wheelhouse. It just didn't sit well with me."
"As stated already, this one is light and refreshing, and perhaps a cut above the brewery's Summer Ale as far as wheat beers go, and is a somewhat decent example of the Witbier style, though perhaps a little on the sweet side."
"D: definitely drinkable, a little too sweet for my tastes but I'm just not a huge white ale guy. I did like this a lot more than ommergang hennepin or hoegaarden. Simply more relaxed than those two."
"I'm usually impressed by Samuel Adams, but I have to admit that with one sip I was a little disappointed with this beer, kind of like this website. Poured a honey Chimay glassful (couldn't bring myself to use a gay Yank glass.) It had very little head or lacing as I drank it. I enjoyed the slightly sweet lemony smell, but the taste was very bland--like a slightly mutated lager. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability was average."
"White Ale is extremely drinkable and you'll never have a problem downing two or three in a single sitting. I've done so on many occasions. I would say that I've had much better wheats but you could do much worse for your money. If you've never had it then it's worth a go."
"My wife bought this beer for me when looking for Ommegang Whitte.. she bought it by accident and i was out of a good beer to drink. I was plesantly surprised it was as good as it was. I would recomned this beer for a summer barbque or picnick with frineds.."
"(From tasting notes dated 25 Jun 2009)"
"It has a very strong flavor of cinammon, but that is way to strong to make it good."
"The taste started out with that grainy characteristic I picked up in the aroma. Then the flavor turned to lemon, orange peel, and coriander. Sweet wheat flavors in the finish with a tangy and some herbal notes. Kind of bland as well. Moderate to high carbonation at times, pretty easy on the palate. Easy to drink too. Not a bad beer but very boring."
"I don't care for the mouthfeel. It's heavy, and coats the tongue and throat -- not thirst-quenching at all. And so I find the drinkability to be on the low side. I much prefer Mothership Wit, or even Hoegaarden."
"Drinkability- Very good"
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow color with a two finger head. The aroma is of citrus fruits. You can't really smell much else. The taste is a crisp citrus flavor. The taste is very clean and very well balanced, there is more citrus than hops. The mouthfeel is on par with most sam adams beers, it is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is very high, you between the taste and the lightness of the beer you can drink many of these."
"N: good for the style, not overly citrused or spiced"
"Another Samual Adams beer I've enjoyed."
"Pretty decent brew."
"Poured a deep gold with thin white head. Nose is light with wheat, citrus. Taste is thin with grass, lemon, wheat and other citrus notes. Mouthfeel is average at best. Pretty thin but tasty. Easy drinking and avaerage comparale to other Witbiers out there."
"Drinkability - I like this beer. This seems like it would be a good hangout beer. I also think this would be good with summer type foods (BBQ, Grilling, Steaks, hot wings, etc.)"
"Pear/apple juice in color maybe a bit lighter with a solide inch of white head that lingered just long enough to remember it. Laced unevenly down the glass with this slight film left behind. Smelled and tasted thoroughly of spice and citrus. A slight hint of pepper. Plenty of bottle yeast that stayed in the glass (my bad). Medium to thick body that leaves a solid full feeling in your mouth. Very drinkable and I look forward to having it off of tap."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it is a little lacking in terms of the style. I would like more carbonation and crispness, as well as more yeast character in the flavor. I'm good for a bottle from time to time, but I don't think I would want more than one and definitely not more than two."
"Being a spring seasonal brew, this is a somewhat low body beer. It's not light by any means, but it's not a heavy filling beer. So, you can drink several at a time relatively easily. It's an easy drinking beer."
"Drinks well, is definitely refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability - If it weren't for the aforementioned dryness I get I'd probably like it. It's not quite as drinkable as the summer seasonal, and quite possibly not as tasty. Oh well. Spring is over I don't know what I'm doing with this one still."
"I like Sam's White. Maybe not the best Wit I have ever had but I will never turn it down. I may prefer it to Sam's summer and would not mind drinking this during the dog days of summer."
"This one's a good beer and plenty drinkable."
"(from old tasting notes form 3 years ago)"
"Sam Adams White Ale is the sort of beer that I'd like multiples of on a hot day. Unfortunately, one of this beer is enough. Not bad by any means, but I just feel as though they could have done better."
"Prost!"
"I enjoy this a lot more than the Imperial White."
"Samuel Adams White Ale pours a deep dull yellow. Short lived head leaves some lacing on my glass. Smells lightly fruity with traces of malts and hops in the nose. The taste is best described as safe. Nothing special and nothing offensive. Refreshing on a hot Southern day but not complex."
"A solid witbier. Definitely not up to par with the likes of a St. Bernardus wit, but definitely a cheaper alternative with decent drinkability."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color with hues of orange. About a 1 finger white head that reduces to film. Some random spotty lacing is left. Nose is of a zesty lemon, a bit flowery..not overpowering and slightly muted. Tastes sweet and lemony with a decent balance of yeast. Finishes with a hint of sweetness and the aftertaste has a grapefriut hop tones. Mouthfeel is very crisp, light bobied, decently carbonated. It's a beer for a hot summer day - nothing really stands out and grabs you, but I would so kick these back while Bar-b-q'ing."
"Drinkability? It is fairly refreshing though not what I would consider in the upper etchalon of the style so....a pretty good drinker. It isn't one that I would turn to often."
"N: this is the best of the Sam's seasonal brews in my personal opinion. I actually this this is the most balanced of all the Sam Adams beers. It may not be the best, but it seems to hit s the style it's going for very well."
"Pretty solid atmosphere. Pretty basic nose, but pleasant. Same with the palette. . . pretty simple but good balance. Pretty solid quaff."
"Just a little better than average."
"The foam was white in color, somewhat thick and not too lacey. The color was a hazy gold with a light orange highlight. The smell was a semi-fruity wheat with a small hops balance. The taste had a brazed wheat and hops balance with a hint of fruit. Mouthfeel - light to medium-bodied and smooth. Drinkability - smooth an ok session."
"Overall, this is an okay beer. I think there are several places to me that could be improved but I also find white ales to not be my favorite, of which this actually competed quite well. I could drink this and plan to enjoy the next one with a stir fry."
"Its a dry beer, but it's impressive how long the scent stays as opposed to airing out. Good spring/summer beer."
"D-Overall, I personally enjoyed this beer with the time of year it seems fitting. I don't think I would personally go out and buy a sixer of it but at the bar it's a nice fit. Nice going Sam Adams."
"D - For a spring ale it has good qualities but in the end it's kind of just above average I think. Good and goes down with ease but it doesn't present anything special."
"Pours a hazy golden color, thin frothy head that leaves a high amount of lacing. Smells citrusy, kinda sweet maybe. Tastes like more citrus, maybe berries. As it warmed it got slightly buttery -don't know what thats about. Nice enough but not remarkable."
"M-D- Easy on the mouth with only a tang to offend the way it works. Easy to drink in my opinion but would only try not buy."
"It's great to be able to drink this beer out in Arizona. It brings back memories of Spring in New England. Seems to have a clean, German taste to it. I've had this many times but for some reason never got around to reviewing it. A lot of malt and a bit of spiciness. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable. Love this style from Sam Adams."
"Lot of good things going on here. A fluffy, cloudy head floated above the hazy, golden yellow brew, and it never really settled down. Some floral and citrus notes on the nose. The crisp wheaty malt and the light citrus, lemon notes work pretty well here. There is a slight yeastiness to this, as well as a slight corinder sip. Nice creamy mouth feel. A solid, refreshing beer for spring."
"-this beer seems like it's just a smaller version of the summer ale, but i could have a few more of these esp. on a hot day"
"[Drinkability]: It's alright beer, I don't like the chocky aftertaste, it makes this beer hard to drink."
"Pale gold, very light haze, with a thick bright white cap of fine bubbles. A bit of chunky lacing, good head retention. Cereal grain aroma with lemon/citrus, faint spice. Smooth, creamy texture. More body than expected, but still on the light side. Some dryness, a little soapy. Mild flavour overall, cereal, grains, coriander, lemons. Quite an approachable brew. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"A hazy golden/orange color pour with a lasting medium white head,some spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet and fruity,with a bit of wheat and hay. Flavor is a touch sweet up front toasted caramel alt,some wheat,orange zest,butterscotch, and odds and ends of spice notes here and there.Medium body and mouthfeel,crisp fruity/spicy finish,very sessionable,better than expected."
"Overall: always a good decision"
"D: Not terribly impressed. A little too much spiciness; not the type of beer I like to have as a sipper."
"D- An interesting beer. I'm glad a tried it, but it's not a beer I see myself buying again any time soon."
"Decent beer, but if I'm reaching for a witbier I may go for an alternative instead."
"D - This is the easiest drinking beer I've ever had. The perfect summer beer (even though it's the spring seasonal.) Open mouth, pour down throat, it's as simple as that."
"I'm stopping here. I am completely let down with this. I had true high hopes for this beer, as it works great in our hot weather here in CA. And at $6.99/sixer, I might have gone back and bought more, but this is close to a drain pour. Now what to do with the other five bottles..."
"Pours a hazy orange from the bottle with a formidable two fingers of frothy, white head. Plenty of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Smell is pleasant--at first a light blend of orange, lemon zest, and clove, but a yeasty aroma soon takes over. I taste the same flavors, with the orange and breadiness magnified. The taste and body are light, just what I enjoy in the style. The finish is leaning toward crisp, with room for improvement, however. Very drinkable on a warm spring day, and one of my favorites from SA."
"Nice beer. Nothing spectacular, but a nice, mellow style. Easy drinking. Not too sharp or sweet like some whites."
"D: Not bad, but there are so many choices that are much better."
"Pretty smooth beer with a light orange/vanilla/grain taste. Decent beer to drink on a spring/summer day. Other than that there isn't much that stands out about it."
"Overall a well made white ale that is similar in style to Hoegaarden. A very good beer for the summertime."
"It has a lot of head and lace both are and off white tan almost a beige color. This was a little weird due to there not being a lot of carbonation to the body. The head is a perfect 2.5 fingers. It has a cereal grainy flavor. The fruitiness reminds be of like an off brand children's vitamin. There is a light and smooth mouthfeel. This beer is just a little above average for me."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could enjoy a couple pints of Sam White on a warm day. It's very refreshing, with some zesty, citrus flavors, and pretty thirst quenching overall. I didn't like the overall appearance of this beer though, it just looked dull, and lacking, and I would have appreciated more citrus flavors instead of zesty orange peel like flavors. All in all though it's pretty decent, I say it's worth a try. Cheers!"
"D- I can't see anything wrong with this beer unless you are looking for a strong barley malt or darkened malt taste."
"D: this is a good one and I could drink several, especially in warmer weather. I wish for a bit more flavor profile and depth but it's satisfactory and with good mouthfeel and average abv it's highly drinkable. Good beer."
"D - if served colder than I had it (it was out of the fridge for about 15 minutes) it would be a bit better. certainly a respectable presentation from Sam Adams though."
"at first look it was a nice cloudy yellow with a decent head not much to tappering off.. smells where sweet and wheaty.. taste was smooth and could tell it was hints of wheat and sweet malts.. not bad at frist taste and held its taste till end.. mouth was not over powered by wheat.. and no ingreant was overpowering.. it was very smooth"
"sam adams pulls a nice, medium bodied refreshing wit over here, worthy of sessioning due to price and quality. maybe not the best wit but a decent one anywhere."
"This is pretty drinkable. Not because it's a great witbier, but because it almost tastes like a malternative. That said, it's not a bad choice if that's what you're looking for."
"I went to Morton's Steak House and this seemed to be the best offering they had in a 12 oz. It went well with oysters."
"Sam Adams impressed me with this one."
"Drinkability: This is nicely drinkable for an evening out or to accompany a salad for dinner. While its not the best witbier I've tasted I rather like the subdued and gentle spices that do not overwhelm as happens with some witbiers."
"D..Easy to drink. Three or four go down easily with minimal impact. Again, this is just about the SA offering I've come across in all my years."
"drinkability: good quality, not my favorite, but a great crossover beer from macros. Especially if they like Blue Moon."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Very easy to drink beer. No harsh aftertaste just nothing to write home about. A fairly good beginners beer."
"Overall, I liked the beer. Would drink again, but wouldn't go out of my way to look for it."
"D(rinkability) - It's a pretty drinkable beer.. I'm just not crazy about it. It doesn't leave me hurrying for another sip."
"Taste leans toward the orange peel side of the wit spectrum and does not show much coriander or wheat flavors. It's an ok beer, but a sub-par witbier. Easy enough to drink and goes down smooth."
"Overall a lot better than I was expecting, but still nothing to exciting with this beer. Easy to drink and pretty flavorful."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. I was very impressed with the head. It was over two fingers thick. At first the aroma did not come out but after drinking half the beer I was more able to detect a hint of spice that is common for this style. The color was a dark yellow but it was a lot clearer than I expected for an unfiltered beer. The carbonation was very good and it made an alley of bubbles down the center of my tongue. The mouth feel was light and watery. I will have to admit at first the flavor was weak but about half way through it started to become more robust. All in all I like that Samuel Adams is not afraid to try different seasonal styles but I don't like how they have sacrificed boldness to sell to the general public."
"D - This beer is absolutely fantastic any time of day when in season. Morning, afternoon, night, and with any meal, I could happily put away several of these at a time. I suspect the spiciness would begin to bother after a while, but by the time that happens you'll be too toasted to care."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden yellow. A small head but no real lacing. Aroma of bananas,cloves,and spices. Very pleasant smell. Has a great crisp mouthfeel. Very clean with good cabonation. Nice flavor of bananas and spice. This is a great transistion from winter to summer. Very drinkable. Can easily drink several of these in a session. One of my favorite SA's seasonals."
"I haven't liked a lot of the recent SA offerings, but this is one of their better efforts. A nice beer."
"i'd like to find something similar/comparable that takes it up a level."
"Drinkability- Light and easy drinking, yet overcarbonated for style and also too hoppy. Not undrinkable, but nor is it memorable."
"D: This is a rock solid brew and widely available thanks to being part of the Sam Adams family. Good all around and the best of the four Sam's seasonals, definitely worth a try given how easy it is to get on tap. A brew SA can be proud of to be sure."
"A decent beer, doesn't nearly have the flavor of traditional wits. Decent sessioner."
"D: Not the best wit out there, but completely solid. Go for it, big guy."
" There are better Wits out there, but this is a solid example of the style and much better than some well known versions. Worth keeping a six-pack in the fridge."
"I think this is actually more enjoyable than the new Imperial white.. it's fairly light and easy and since it is their spring seasonal I suppose thats fitting.. Its got pretty much just all your standard wit affair, definite orange and coriander noticeable in the taste and aroma.. its also a bit bready. Its got a lighter mouthfeel and very easy to drink.. Its nothing wildly groundbreaking, but its definitely good when you are looking for say something to session or to eat with dinner at a restaurant."
"It is pale in looks compared to Sam's Boston Lager and Cherry Wheat, and has a unique taste. It is a Ale that I will drink again."
"A decent witbier taste, although the grassiness a la Blue oon creeps in rather than the crisp freshness of a Hoegaarden. Average for the American version of the style, not bad, but wouldn't choose this."
"On par with mainstream White Ales. A bit better on tap than I can remember the bottle tasting."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Honeyed straw color with a weak white head that fizzles out pretty quickly. Wheaty banana pith aroma with touches of coriander and orange peel. Flavor is pale malty with some wheat and the aforementioned spices. Body is medium-thin, carbonation is high. Drinkable but exceedingly average."
"D- Overall not a bad brew, but a little lacking in some areas that other wheat beers excel."
"D - Could drink quite a few of these, but outside temp will determine which days I'd go to this one. Overall, a fair example of the style."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable beer, will definitely purchase again, though a bit heavy, but very good."
"Not one of my favorites but for a spring seasonal, pretty drinkable. Crisp and refreshing, this is good to have on a hot day."
"Overall- Maybe my expectations were too high for this beer, because I find I was extremely disappointed. I have tried this beer twice and I find the wheat beer basis for this beer is mediocre at best, and the 10 spices are completely forgettable and musky. The beer does NOT adhere to the Witbier style and lacks the complexities that come with more suspended yeast, better malted wheat, and more interesting spices. I found this beer to be extremely over hyped. For the same price you can get Hoegaarden, which is a superior beer in every possible way and the standard for the style. I would also prefer Blue Moon to this beer as Blue Moon is more refreshing, has a cleaner wheat beer base (even if it contains more adjunct filler), and a better spice profile."
"D: I could drink a few of these. It isn't offensive, just not my bag. I had a lot higher expectations, I honestly would rather drink a straight up Blue Moon than this. A little over hyped."
"D: A pretty uninspired offering from the SA bunch. Inoffensive but weak on-tap."
"The taste is very similar to the smell. The spices can be overly prominent at times hindering the drinkability. The carbonation provides a luscious pleasurable creaminess. Hops are light and spicy with a mellow background of malt that fails to keep up with the spiciness of the beer."
"D: Great springtime beer, the spiciness lends itself to cool evenings but its overall refreshing taste is great for the warming spring weather."
"After reading a few other reviews, I'm wondering if I had a batch that had been sitting around too long."
"D - great spring beer, very good."
"It pours a smooth orange color with a nice white head. A delicious Wit Bier with many different flavors in one. I enjoy the drinkability of this beer in the spring and wish it was around all year. Definitely a beer you can enjoy from a bottle or from a tap. I highly recommend this beer and mot brews from Sam Adams"
"On tap this poured a cloudy orange color with a long lasting white head. It smelled of citrus, oranges, and wheat. The mouth feel is a little thin but not horrible. This beer would be great for a hot summer day. There is nothing really complex about the beer just a solid, easy drinking beer."
"Drink - Very refreshing"
"Very refreshing brew. It's really a shame it's not year round."
"Overall a pretty average witbier, but not bad at all. Very smooth drinking beer. Nice flavor and good balance."
"Cheers!!!"
"Pours a hazy amber/ yellow with great big white head that laces to the glass. Sweet malty and citrus aroma. Some orange and spring spices. Tastes nice and light with good wheat taste and amazing spices. I also get the taste of citrus like lemon/orange. Very thin in the mouth. Leaves nice coating and smooth flow make this very drinkable."
"Overall: Flavors are not overwhelming which makes this Witbier quite drinkable. Definitely a rock solid Sam Adams brew, and although not my favorite Witbier, absolutely worth a try."
"Drinkability: An acceptable witbier, but, by no means is it my favorite, as I find the underlying malts to be a bit bland."
"Cloudy yellow appearance. Smells fruity like citrus and Fruity Pebbles cereal. Light texture and clean finishing. Tastes yeasty, fruity, spiced, and like a Belgian white typically tastes like. Kind of thin and somewhat watery but I think that typical for this style of beer. I would sum this beer up as being a diet La Fin Du Monde. That's how I can best explain the character."
"Drinkability - Very sessionable beer"
"D- A simple beer that is quite good and drinkable. One of Sam Adams better beers imo, and pretty sessionable. A pretty simple and standard wit."
"D 4.0 - better witbier than most macro examples, excellent appearance and aroma, a nice surprise from the SA/Boston team!"
"This is another nice offering from Sam Adams. I wouldn't mind seeing it in the summer as well as spring. I won't make it my everyday beer, but it will have a regular spot in my fridge until it is gone."
"Overall - As a Witbier, it's slightly off. But as a Spring Seasonal, it does fill that role well. I'll probably pick up a 6-pack of this every spring; it's a fairly nice one to have occasionally."
"Samuel Adams White Ale is an ale that is refreshing and complements the spring season. Sure worth a revisit."
"M/D - Quite a bit of carbonation, as associated with most ales. Very smoother, crisp, and light. Nice spicy aftertaste as well"
"Fairly good carbonation, and clean finish. This is a quencher by far. A decent representative of the style, but fairly middle of the road in comparison with others. I dug it, and would buy it again, but I only got this because the tap selection was limited. Nothing that I would substitute for a higher quality beer."
"D--I could drink this all night. Period."
"A very solid Witbier that I plan on having at least once a year."
"D: Light and refreshing, yet full of flavor. Excellent use of spices for a spring seasonal. Complex, but nothing sticks out too much."
"Very slight haze to an orange body. Good carbonation feeds the off-white head. Typical spiced witbier aroma. Less crisp and fruity than I like my wits to smell. Very refreshing with a little bit of citrus. I think this would make a really good lawn-mower beer."
"Nice refreshing beer. Malty, tastie, good beginning, good end. Looks really good, pale and slightly cloudy, orangie. Good head and decent ring left around the glass. Smells fruity and malty with a bit of hops. Taste like a standard beer of this style with a long lasting nice aftertaste of citrus and malt. East to drink."
"It ain't that bad, I would really enjoy this on a warmer day."
"Cheers!"
"Cracked this one open in a weak attempt to pretend that it's spring in the middle of February. Pours a cloudy, dull yellow colour, not unlike other witbiers. Whitish head wasn't impressive- about 1/2 inch tall. The smell is mostly wheat and esther (go figure) and slightly citrusy, with a faint yet sharp lemon scent if you really take a deep breath. Mouth feel is standard and pleasant. The taste isn't dazzling but it's fine. It's a fine little drink - certainly not a standout for its style, but it's definently drinkable."
"Bottle to pint glass, this beer is a cloudy straw yellow. The head is small and diminishing, no lacing is left behind. Smells of clove and other sweet fruits. Not a great nose, faint and weak. The taste follows the smell, and just isn't great. For the taste, think Sam Adams Cherry Wheat without the cherry. There is some banana, but the sweetness gives way to an ugly finish. The carbonation and mouthfeel is pretty good. You could drink quite a few of these, I'm just not sure I'd want to."
"though the flavor was rather weak... the complexity is there, its just really hard to get at. i drank this in february (quickly), and can only imagine what one (or several) would would be like on a warm summer day"
"D- I could have another one of the these beers. Overall, not a huge fan of Sam Adam's beers, but I do enjoy there seasonal line."
"D-A great poolside diversion, which is how it was consumed. perfect for this, and a perfect warm weather quencher, if that is what you are looking for."
"D - this tasted awful. I'll stick to Blue Moon."
"Notes: This struck me as a very solid wheat beer. It is a good witbier to go as a solid example of the style. I remain partial to Hoegaarden but this remains a solid choice."
"a drinkable brew, however when it comes to the low-cost widely available beers of this style, ill take a blue moon over this everyday. i was fairly disappointed."
"Overall, not the best wit out there but tasty and sessionable to boot."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a very drinkable style."
"D - Seeing as it's still cold out...this one wouldn't work...but I could see myself drinking a few of these once it starts getting warmer"
"An interesting take on the style. Highly hopped(American) and low on the wheat as a percentage of the grain bill from what I can gather. The apple doesn't fall far.., overall too sweet in taste and too viscous for the style in the finish. Feeble. And I'm being nice."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth, with a nice amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability: Definitely quaffable, I could easily see putting back a few of these on an evening. I find the style to be quite refreshing and light, good for spring. Overall, the beer is solid and approachable, although it falls a tad short of outstanding. I'm sure I'll pick it up next year if I find it on sale again."
"Drinkability is good, but would be excellent if this was not so mettalic, a good session beer perhaps."
"Comes out of the tap a hazy honey-golden with a decent white head. Aroma is strong and wheaty with a lemony undertone. Rich wheaty flavor has lemony and yeasty tones, and is quite refreshing. Definitely better on-tap! Slippery, jazzy texture leaves behind a nice tingle and a touch of lemon."
"drinkability is ok. it's light but nothing special."
"Mouthfeel is nice and thin bodied for extra quenchiness."
"I don't really like this one, so drinkability takes a hit. I would much rather grab a Hoegaarden."
"The body is closer to moderate than light. Some chewiness from the wheat notes. Carbonation is light for style but still good. Overall there are some nice malt notes, but in the end the limited yeast and citrus notes are just lacking to really excel this beers rating."
"Drinkability: Not sure why this is a wit. Doesn't seem like one to me. More like a macro with macro taste. There just isn't much here."
"M&D--Way too chewy and thick for the style, and if it were spring or summer I couldn't manage the humidity with one of these. A miss from this brewery in my opinion."
"Not really your typical witbeer, but SA doesn't really claim it to be one as it says right on the bottle that it is an American interpretation of the style. As an American wheat this is a pretty tasty beer, but up against other witbeers it is not as good."
"Good beer over, very drinkable, not as watery as most witbiers"
"D- OK, but there is much better out there for this style."
"I still pine for the days of the ""3 cases for $9.00"" lawnmower beer. That ol' Pfeiffer and Fox Deluxe went down pretty well on a hot day! And we ""didn't need no"" wheat, coriander or orange peel to appreciate it."
"12oz brown bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale yellow straw colour with somewhat of a cloudiness to it. Their is a decent white fizzy head that quickly dissipates and leaves a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is a little grassy with some orange peel and light scent of coriander. A light taste similar to Hoegaarden with the wheat and pale malt dominated and coriander being stronger than the orange peel. A nice beer but I think they should make it a year round brew since this would be a nice beer during the summer time. The Irish Red should be turned into their Spring Seasonal."
"Overall, it's what I expected. A cloudy, light witbier - the fruit smell and taste are very appropriate for the spring season - good job Sam Adams."
"A pretty good stab at the style, this is no Allagash White but what really is? On par with the more mainstream White Ales and certainly more flavorful than Hoegaarden. A mild buttery goat cheddar is a perfect pairing with this one."
"i had this one last year and i wasnt the biggest fan...they should still call this 'spring ale' like they used to, because its definitely not a witbier (at least not anymore)"
"Very drinkable. A good witbier, but not great. I wouldn't pass this brew up but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Drinkability - Pretty good"
"Revisit on this one at a colder temp and had to upgrade. Is darn good cold and after a long days work!"
"Golden coloring with 1 finger head - good retention. Not as cloudy as described for a Witbier. Citrus orange scent, crisp clean lemon taste, that was a little tart at the back. A little heavy on the carbonation, average mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer, clean taste, nothing overpowering."
"The drink is light-medium in body with fine carbonation and very good drinkability, no matter how far out of whack the ""Seasonality"" of the beer is. Bring on Spring!"
"Sam's white is lacking in flavor even for a wit. What flavor it did have was very pleasant, with a great balance of citrus and spice. This also gave the beer a wonderful aroma, all be it subtle. Where this beer really wins out is in drinkability, it was refreshing and smooth with a nice mouth feel. It's a great good choice for a hot day."
"Mouth feel is severely damaged by hideous overcarbonation. Way too spiky on the tongue for my taste. Also a bit light bodied. No good. Drinkability suffers for this as well."
"D= pretty high. great spring beer. This one is not quite as flavorful as I expected but maybe that's what makes it so drinkable. Pretty nice brew."
"The taste is rather typical for the style. Light-bodied and somewhat tart as it hits your palate and there is a definite crispness there. You can taste the spices as coriander, orange peel, vanilla, and black pepper all come to mind. The finish is dry but slightly tangy which makes this not as refreshing as some."
"This is a pretty good witbier but I prefer Bell's Winter White and even Blue Moon to this one. It tastes pretty standard but a had a bit more sour taste to it that I just can't completely enjoy. I love Sam Adams but this one just isn't my favorite. As far as seasonals go, I love the winter lager."
"From the SA mix pack at Hannaford market. Pours a unusual golden white color, but still quite clear. Smells quite malty and sweet. Taste is quite sweet, citrusy, but not overly so, and this is from start to finish. Mouthfeel good, a bit on the thin side for me. Overall a good, if not overexciting offering, but I do like it and would buy it again. Would also recommend it to newbies who want something more than Bud or Miller."
"All in all a decent beer. Slight corriander taste/smell, nothing else really stood out to me. Lightly carbonated. Not much happening in the mouth. The whole experience left me neither happy nor unhappy - very eventful. Given the choice, for #2 I'd choose a different one."
"I am more than generous on points for a beer I really wouldnt have gotten on my own."
"This beer poured a slightly hazy yellow with quickly reducing head. Slight smell of grass and spice. Taste lingers a bit, finishing clean with a bit of spice. All in all an enjoyable brew. Not my favorite style however. Bought as a part of the Brewmaster selection."
"D: Goes down very easily. Nothing truly stands out with this brew, but that can be either good or bad!"
"Overall it's an okay beer that I could drink all night. I would just rather have one of the other wits out there."
"D - At first I did not care for this beer, but then I had it on tap, then in a bottle again, and found it quite an enjoyable experience, with lots of flavor and drinkability, and very good Witbier"
"Pours a slightly cloudy, pale yellow. One inch head with good retention and good lacing. Smells of spices (coriander) and some sweet malt. Fits the style. There's a crisp and smooth mouth feel. High carbonation levels are present. Tastes of spices (coriander mostly) with a slight malt flavor noticeable. Not near enough other flavors besides the spice concentration, overall."
"D-Pretty decent drinkability, as it's smooth and tasty, and would likely be pretty refreshing on a warm summer day."
"While not the best in its class, this White Ale is a wonderfully delicious ale that needs year-round availability (at least summertime!). It pours a nice cloudy weiss-like appearance that clears with a nice fluffy white head full of spicy aromas. The bubbly feel is not too sharp and draws out lemon-wheat and spices without becoming a Blue Moon. The lace clings as this smooth, creamy but light (not too light) ale disappears."
"D-Easy to drink as this came out extemely early I will more than likely review it again this spring in warmer weather I think it would effect my review quite a bit."
"Pours a big white head that is lasting with decent lacing. A cloudy, tan-amber colored body. Has an aroma of spices, coriander, and flowers. A nice taste of some spices, and coriander, with a clean aftertaste. Nice sweet spicy taste."
"D: A decent offering overall, spicy, with a nice crisp nature and good for a summer picnic beer with light conversation."
"Like most Sam Adams, this is above average, but nothing great. Cloudy gold pour with a slight white head. Light orange peel, vanilla, and wheat aroma. Taste is more wheat and vanilla, with some spice and a starchy mouthfeel. Like a watered down Chimay Cinq Cent."
"Not my favorite white but very refreshing and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Still a decent wit, and its refreshing enough, so I can recommend trying this, even though I'll be reaching for an Allagash or Hoegaarden."
"The Spring offering from Sam Adams, the last seasonal I had yet to try. I must say, this one is kinda boring here. Just your standard run-of-the-mill Witbier, nothing really stands out about it. I mean, it fits all the style guidelines and is tasty and drinkable for sure, but I couldn't help thinking I'd prefer a Blue Moon or Shock Top over this."
"It's a neat take on the witbier style that is worth a sixer pick up each summer."
"Pours a cloudy golden color, not a ton of head or lace but some. It's a refreshing enough beer but nothing outstanding. Sweet wheaty citrus notes with a zing of lemon in the flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. Not bad for the warmer weather."
"D - High, I could drink a lot of these, it's very easy going down. I'd recommend this to someone just starting to get into craft beer. It's a good gateway beer."
"D- Very good, I definitely will by this beer again. I think it's more of a winter beer than spring, but that's just my opinion."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium head on a slightly cloudy golden body. Smell and taste were about the same: typical wibier fruity/spicy. In fact, a tad too much in the mixture. Also came across a bit too carbonated. A good beer, but not among the best wit's."
"pour with medium to very little head. cloudy amber apperence. Flavor fell short in my opinion. It didn't have that bite that other better belgian whites have. I would describe it as a belgian white light (if there is such a thing, and I know there isn't) very good winter beer, but i could imagine myself drinking this during the summer months. Undenyably drinkable...Good beer. nuff said"
"nothing I would go out of my way to purchase,yet I would buy it again. A decent brew.There is much more to offer for the style."
"D: Um, no."
"Drinkability is ok, but the beer is fairly bland. I have had better!!!!"
"D - This wouldn't be a terrible beer to session, I could probably even look past the incomprehensible bitterness, but the mouthfeel is so damn confused that I'd probably choose something else."
"I had to pour this one into the sink and I didn't even feel bad doing it."
"D- Yes I'll be buying this one again."
"D- It's a refreshing drink. I find that it resembles an american spiced wheat more than a witbier. That being said there are many other wits that aren't as bland as this."
"This was suprisingly dark with a cloudy orangish color and a light tan head. The nose has lots of citrus fruit and some peppery spices. The taste also has a big orange or lemon presence followed by yeaty herbs. A clean light body has a crisp feel. Nothing spectacular, but a good drinker."
"Was served to me in a standard pint glass, slightly hazy yellow in color. No head. Smell was grainy. Taste was pretty mild, a hint of a Belgian yeast strain, but the taste was mostly grainy as well. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin and carbonation prickly. Drinkability was ok, but I have had MUCH better witbier's. I would classify this more of an American Pale Wheat Ale. I like a lot of Sam Adam's beers, but this one was only ""pretty good""."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer, a good brew for hot summer days. However, as I said, it's not as good as others of the style. Pleasant, though."
"D: Very drinkable, I have no problem with this beer. Its ok, nothing great."
"D: A good wit, not great, middle of the road for me in the Sam Adams franchise, easy enough to drink, a beer that has its moments."
"On Tap at Detroit Airport at Max and Emma's, this brew had a golden wheat color with a 1/4 inch white head that had decent lacing on the glass. The aroma was of strong wheat and banana with a slight hint of spice. The taste was very heavy on the wheat side, some spice and even a hint of sweetness. Could feel the carbonation more than I like. This was an ok brew, but with my pending trip to Germany (that is why I was at the airport) I expect to have better."
"Drinkability: This would make a perfectly decent session beer."
"A highly drinkable interpretation of the witbier style. Fresh and spicy!"
"It's a very cloudy yellow-gold color with modest white fuzz on top and a carpet of lace. A mild lemon wheat aroma, apple and a hint of malt. A mild but tastey bread based flavor. Very smooth with some fullness in body while providing a tangy, well carbonated refreshment. Crisp fruit overtones as noted in the aroma, even cherry perhaps. But overall the accent is on the bready edible quality. Quite enjoyable and somewhat unique, good quality. I find this to be a very drinkable choice, goes down quick and easy with decent flavor."
"Drinkability: after many years of drinking SA White Ale, it's always one beer I look forward to come springtime. All around good drinking beer."
"I've had this on tap a few times and I definitely remember it having a better mouthfeel and more flavor than the bottled version."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a murky golden orange color with a white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is wheat, citrus, corriander and orange peel. The taste features much of the same flavors as in the nose with a lot of wheat and some citrus that is smooth and crisp. Overall, this is a pretty decent stab at the witbier style. It certainly does not live up to some of the ones from Belgium, but it is a pleasant beer to drink."
"I really enjoy Sam Adams as an easily available good beer, not excellent, but still very good. This beer is not their best effort. The nose is very good, you can smell the lemon and coriander quite prominently and I even catch some cinnamon as well, but it doesn't translate to the flavor. It is a good beer after a long day at work, but I don't think it would be something I would seek out. Bottom line, it is an okay beer but not a great example of a Belgian."
"A mediocre one from Boston Beer Company. Had it on tap and was more impressed there. Pours your standard wit color, almost pure orange with a fairly nice white head. Very minor lacing. Nose is pretty good, lots of orange, citrus, coriander and yeast. Flavor was quite bland, mild spices and wheat, but not much there. Body was solid, although nothing that could save the general un-impressiveness. Overall, not great, but serviceable if you want a wit and it's the only one available."
"The smell is spices with orange peel and wet hay, coriander. It is very creamy and smooth. You get some bitterness on the finish. Good flavor on the witbier. In the mouth it was lightly carbonated. I would buy this one again if it was in better circulation out here in Portland."
"A nice quaffable brew. A solid example of the style. On par with Hoegaarden."
"D: Very quaffable, great product, not a notable wit by any means, but at least a quality product available nationwide. I find that when I'm in a foreign market and its spring time, I'll ""fall back"" to SA White when ordering at the bar."
"Taste and aroma were simply orange zest with was a touch of clove, coriander, and wheat that left a quite thin mouthfeel. Wasn't that impressed - I'll be grabbing for a different wit next time."
"This to me was an ok wit that could have had more flavour. The colour was dark for the style and the nose was not too apparent. The beer was certainly drinable but I expected more from these guys as I love their lager. I want to try again in a bottle and see if improves."
"A bit too heavy on the spices here, but that's the only complaint. Would go great with any dessert or maybe Indian or Thai food."
"Overall: a nice brew on an 80+ degree day. SA White doesn't have the floral, perfumey nose and taste of some other witbiers but that's fine by me. A beer I would happily have on hand as a summertime go-to refresher."
"Overall a tasty wit."
"Pale yellow with some haziness. Not as much as other wits, though. Scent of malts and some citrus-like fruitiness. I like the different blends of the spices. The flavors blend together pretty well -- wheat, malt with hints of pepper, citrus and fruits with a nice bitterness in the finish. A nice spring brew."
"This is a typical witbier. Nothing to existed about, but it is still not a bad beer at all."
"All and all a good beer. I have had it on tap and in bottle and both of them are fantastic. Will buy again."
"D: One is enough. It is light and refreshing, but far from inspiring. As a side note, it is interesting to see Sam Adams start recommending food pairing on the bottle."
"Overall a pretty solid white beer. Not the best thing ever, but enjoyable with dinner."
"I had this on tap at Bradley airport in CT. After looking at my beer I had to re-confirm they gave me the correct one. This didn't look like a witbier at all, it was in fact orange colored and somewhat clear (tranlucent plastic cup made it hard to tell). The aroma didn't really say ""witbier"" to me either. Mostly I smelled a lightly spiced ale, perhaps the correct spices but not the yeasty fruitiness I wanted. It was easy drinking, but not my favorite interpretation of a wit, and I probably won't get it again."
"The White Ale is on sale now as stores are looking to unload it for the summer brews. Great time to pick up a sixer or two. They've made a believer out of me this year with the White Ale."
"Drinkable but not very thrilling. Based on others' reviews, this may be a different formulation for draft or just plain watered down."
"Notes: A nice brew. I have't been all that into wits lately but this is a nice easy drinking example."
"This is a very enjoyable and easy drinking ale. Though admittedly not one of my favorite styles I admire this one. The beer poured with a lightly cloudy light orange color. the smell was of restrained wheat. The use is noble hops is restrained for a Sam Adams beer, and it balances very well with the spices that the style demands. Maybe my favorite so far of this style."
"D- Easy drinker right here. Im sure I will have this one many more times this summer as this is offered at a wide range of bars and restaurants. Good stuff."
"D: Not one of the best wits on the market, but a very good one at a good price."
"Overall- This is one of my favorite Sam Adams Seasonals. It's missing some of the ""wow"" factor of other Wits, but still holds its own."
"This was definitely a good beer, but not great. I was kind of glad to be done with it. It just wasn't as balanced as Allagash or other great witbiers I've had."
"D- having tried alot of lighter beers and springtime ales, white ales, etc. this is one of my favorites. so fruit and floral, it would go good with breakfast instead of orange juice and it probably has just as much vitamin C."
"This is another better than average offering from SA. I'm getting tired of trying their rather longish menu of different styles, most of which are a few notches above mediocre. The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with some head, retention, lacing. The smell and taste are just too subdued. You'll get some coriander, banana, some spices, lemony hints, maybe some other fruits emanating from the yeasts used in fermentation. The beer is just too watery, too safe, and too middle of the road to be of much interest. It's okay, it is fairly representative of the style, but like so many other SA offerings, this is just an above average beer. There is plenty of drinkability here, nothing offensive, nothing to challenge the palate, and nothing all that memorable either. It's an okay beer and that's all I can say."
"Another unfiltered wheat beer. Definitely not my favorite genre of beer, but I gave it a try. This one had a strange sweet and bitter combination, with a lemon/lime flavor. Pretty interesting for a few sips, but not something I would ever want to drink regularly."
"Has a dark gold color when poured. Has a fairly long lasting head, had some lacing, but not a ton. Has a citrus taste and smell, lemon stands out the most as well as some spices. It's light and smooth with a medium amount of carbonation, may taste even better as it gets warmer out."
"Taste: Peppery, with a strong coriander, with citrus notes, After a few pints the taste changes the peppery taste gives way to the citrusy splendor. I look forward to this beer's release year after year."
"Drinkability- What a nice segway from a long winter to spring. I can see this also being quite refreshing in the summer."
"I'll give it a good grade."
"d- i bought a sixer and drank it during a Pens game and they started and ended at the same time"
"Overall a nice witbier , for a warm spring day."
"D- This beer is okay in my opinion, not on par with some of Sam Adam's other choices. Would drink again if offered, but probably would not purchase of my own accord."
"Recommended..."
"D: Taste is refreshing but for some reason it seems a little fuller than its flavor would suggest. It's a good offering, but nothing especially outstanding."
"This is a really enoyable beer. The winter was spent enjoying the dark and heavy beers/ stouts. I am not much for Pilsners or light body beers. This was a nice shift and enjoyable as well. The light buttery flavors gave it more of taste than most of the ales I am used to. i'd drink this through the day; with some reds in the mix just for fun."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol makes it very sessionable, but lack of flavor is discouraging."
"Drink ability - I wouldn't buy another of these, but if someone offered a free one, I wouldn't turn it down... After all it is beer..."
"D - Easy drinking, and not too filling. Very drinkable."
"D: Well, its 40 and rainy. Going to buy another 6, and hold it for another month or so, when it gets warm here in St. Louis. My guess, be a great lawnmower beer. My style for summer, is a Wit, and, this might be the ticket."
"Overall a solid choice which is to be expected from Sam Adams. The spicy/hop flavor was a little overwhelming at first but it grows on you quickly. I could drink a good bit of these once that initial spice settles down."
"It's weird, I had a six-pack over the weekend while I was in DC and the beer tasted spicier...more like a winter beer. each beer I had, i also drank out of the bottle. the one im drinking right now which i poured in t a pint glass has more of a summer ale feel and taste....im not sure if it's what you drink out of or the specific batch"
"Very drinkable. I had this with a T-bone of all the meals I could have had. It wasn't a textbook pairing but instead a gorgeous sublime fling!"
"Very tame and quite drinkable. Nice session beer for the coming spring months."
"T: very clean and crisp. very spicy and delicious i think this is one of those underrated beers that ppl pan because its not as notable as something foreign of from a place like allagash.. do i think its as good? no, but its damn close in an available package that is well distributed. it is a great way to try the field. good times"
"Brought to the table in a 22 oz glass with a cloudy, orange body and some nice specs of white sudsy head at the top. Aroma is one of the best things about this one with a strong citrus presence, plenty of lemon, orange, tangerine? peels. Lots of coriander, and passion fruit seeds I would imagine. Taste is just as sweet and very balanced. Mouthfeeling is very creamy and paired very well with some spicy wings."
"D: very drinkable. easy drinking middle of the road wit."
"Drinkability - Pretty smooth beer, could have a 6-pack with no issues."
"D- Given the right weather this beer is great, I'm glad it's a seasonal though I wouldn't want this in the colder months."
"Overall not bad. I'd have it again on tap, but I don't think I'd buy a whole six."
"Poured a semi-dark orange color wuth one finger head that had a little constant carbonation. Left a head taht stayed for awhile and some good sheath lacing. The smell is less citric (lemon and orange) and more spices. I saw the commercial where they talk about 10 different spices or something, so maybe a little mind control on their part. But I swear there is a zesty, peppery smell to it. The taste is rather dull, there are light hoppy notes and the orange and lemon come out a little as do the spices, but nothing stands out in particular. There's no spice that stands out, not a strong fruit flavor and not a strong hop bit lead to a thinnish, almost watery smooth mouthfeel. Not the best white, but it makes for a damn good lunch beer."
"D: I really wanted to like it, but after the first, it seemed like the rest of the 6 pack was doomed. my cousin likes these so he was glad to take them off my hands"
"D = This is a pleasant enough beer and I will no doubt drink it again, but it does not ""wow"" me."
"Though not my favorite from Sam Adams, White Ale is nonetheless a good version of Witbier, solid and delicious. Recommended."
"I could drink a few of these at a time, but I'm not sure I'd want to. I was drinking this with a nice plate of jambalaya, an it was a nice way to wash it down. Of the Sam Adams seasonals, this is my least favorite."
"Not a huge fan of Samuel Adams but this is a somewhat decent seasonal offering from them, would drink it again if it was the only thing at the bar other than a macro, cannot really recommend this though"
"I've had this in the past, but never straight from the brewery. This was fantastic. Big, big surprise. Always been a fan of the brew, but this was otherworldly."
"D - Really easy to throw back several of these in one night. Light and fresh with subtle flavors and aromas."
"D- Very drinkable, refreshing, and not very heavy."
"I really like this beer. Would highly recommend."
"This beer poured a copper color with a very thin head. The smell is citrusy with some spices. The taste is mostly sweet citrus up front with some maltiness in the finish that makes for all sweetness. The carbonation makes for a rather crisp beer that's also a little dry. I can't see myself drinking more than one of these at a time, but I may pick some up for lounging around when it gets warmer."
"D- I wish I could have stayed and kept drinking this all night. Really incredible chance to try this beer exactly how the brewers want it. I am going to start drinking all my Sam only directly from the brewery."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Sam Adams White pours a hazy, slightly cloudy yellow/orange with a nice white head. The aroma is sweet with plenty of coriander and a vegetal character. The flavor is crisp and sweet with a nice soft wheat flavor. There is a nice complex blend of spices, definitely more than the typical coriander and orange peel. Flowery flavor underscores the sweetness and fruitiness of the beer. This is a really good offering from Sam Adams, and an interesting take on the style."
"People may knock Sam White Ale as being weak for the style, but I think it's one of the better crafted ones. It doesn't err on the strong side of maltiness or spiciness, but is palateable with many foods."
"This beer was poured into an Imperial pint glass at 46° from a 12 ounce bottle with a best before month notched on the label.  There was approximately one finger of white foamy head which disappeared shortly.  The beer was pale golden and hazy.Fresh citrus greeted the nose to begin with.  Later on I think I detected some hops along with spices.  The beer tasted of orange, coriander (spices) and yeast.  The taste was not sharp but seemed to be smooth and congenial.  This was not overly spicy but accommodated those tastes.This beer invited more sipping as the tastes did not linger and you wanted to drink again in order to enjoy the fruitiness and spices.There was a small amount of lacing as the beer was consumed.  I probably could have consumed a little colder but that could have deadened the fruitiness and the other little nuances that seemed to be just below the surface.  Malt was not apparent in aroma or taste."
"D - This is an okay witbier. And it makes a fine session beer."
"Easy drinking. Another? Sure, why not."
"Light bodied and very pleasant to drink. I think you could turn a lot of BMC drinkers onto this one, ala Blue Moon. Good solid example of one of my favorite styles."
"D-Very drinkable. I really enjoy this beer and wish it was available a little longer. Could easily put a few of these away!"
"Appearance was almost copper in color a bit dark for a wit and cloudy with a two finger white head that left nice lacing. Smell the spices seemed to dominate coriander orange peal and so on with nice sweet malt to balance. Taste sweet malts citrus and spices no bitterness this beer achieves balance with the spices used in it. Mouthfeel mediem to lite body high carbonation."
"Pours rather dark for a belgian witbier (a light copper color), with surprising clarity and just a collar of foam for a head. The aroma is more sweet than spicy, with coriander, flowers and... um, vanilla? Kind of weird for a wit; the lack of citrus elements is kind of a downer for me, as the aroma isn't all that bracing or refreshing for this wit. On the palate, substantial malt flavors, balanced with more citrus elements than the aroma possesses. Very smooth malt flavors and subtle spicing, but little in the way of acidity or refreshment. Overall, this is a fairly tasty beer, but it doesn't have the zest or refreshment I want from a wit."
"Recommended..."
"Poured a slightly hazy amber color with a decent sized white head. However, after a while, the head completely vanished and no lacing was left. Smell was a bit faint, but I was able to detect some spiciness and wheat. Taste was much more potent and quite tasty. Very wheaty with a lot of zesty citrus fruit. Lemons and oranges were there, but it was much sweeter than I'm used to from them. Perhaps there was another fruit that I couldn't put my finger on. Medium body with gentle carbonation. Another solid offering."
"Pours a hazy orange and straw in color, with a nice white head and some good lacing. The smell is sweet with light floral hops and coriander. The flavor is of wheat and light malts with some belgian spice. This is a very good drinkable wit. I would much rather it was releast according to season a bit more (its 10 and snowing and this has been out for weeks) but over all an impressive season offering from Sam Adams"
"A very pleasant and drinkable wit that I would not mind reaching for again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Crackly but not too sharp... smooth enough to deliver a good swallow. It's the most uneventful aspect of this tasting. I would definitely recommend this year's delicious offering in lieu of Allagash's world-class brew if it's not readily available."
"not much after taste. very drinkable."
"Overall not a bad brew from SA, their seasonals seem to all be very solid beers, nothing spectactular but a beer you can drink when out at chain restaurants and still enjoy."
"Finish is pleasant. Wheat and herbal lemon prevail again."
"The White Ale is no exception -- it is certainly not from Belgium, but it is fairer still than many other Americans in its class. A not-unpleasant coriander-and-wheat presence dominates throughout, reminding me somewhat of breakfast cereal. Not as polished or subtle as a European farmhouse brewery might create, but I'd gladly drink this one again -- especially when it's on-tap in a small-town bar!!"
"As far as a white ale goes its not my cup of tea. I would even consider it a poor mans Blue Moon, and Blue Moon ain't exactly the best around."
"Too bad that it is only available in late winter."
"Samuel Adams has done right by this tasty little ale. I have always been a fan of the Blue Moon varieties and other wheat ales, so I decided to give SA a try. I was pleasantly surprised by not only the extreme drinkability of this brew, but also the very good balance which exists between its components. I rarely find a beer that I feel has a good balance of smell, taste, ""mouth after feel", feel, drinkability, and overall balance. Perhaps a bit over carbonated, the carbonation is the first to hit the mouth, followed quickly by sugary-wheat almost powered taste, as if a ground piece of wheat was poured directly into the batch, matched equally well later on by great coriander, orange, medium grain, and light spritzer flavors. These initial tastes are followed finally by a slightly deeper and more syrupy malt taste and feel, leaving a small layer of aftertaste on the tongue and back of the mouth as the sip finishes. The during sip flavors are by far the least substantial aspect of the ale. The drinkability of this ale is superb. Having a few of these back to back would not at all be unpleasant. A great ale, definitely and especially in Spring or Summer settings. I would buy again in a heartbeat, especially to be enjoyed with food. A-."
"12oz bottle purchased from Clarendon Wines in Boston - with a thought to Sam Adams' recent hop giveaway. Consumed in Feb 08 with a June best before date. Pours a pale straw, just slightly cloudy, with a decent head. Very good lacing. Decent, lightly spiced ""white"" aroma. Sadly, the flavour is on the weak side. Can't say the label doesn't warn that it is an ""American version of a classic Belgian white ale""."
"Had this on tap last Thursday night at a restaurant. Came in a super cold pint glass that I let warm up a bit. There's a thin head and not much lacing. The color was a plain shade of cloudy yellow. The smell had a hint of coriander spice to it, but not much else. The taste was barely decent, with only a slight flavor of orange peel to it. Kind of a boring witbier. When this first came out a few years back, I thought it was good. But the more you compare it to other witbiers by American brewers, it doesn't really stand up."
"D-Good spring/summer beer. Pretty refreshing. I could see having a couple of these back to back."
"Drinkability- A good entry level witbeir."
"A decent spring beer... would be good with a salad or as an aperitif."
"The taste is a clean flavor with hints of the orange ans spices. I bought a six pack of this and easily drank a number of them without getting tired of the taste."
"Very drinkable. You could have several, but then, it's really not complex enough to make me want to have several if anything else is available. Would be great with spicy food or pizza."
"I'm not a huge fan of the style but this certainly isn't doing anything to convince me otherwise."
"Very drinkable-interesting for late winter but would be a good beach beer. Solid commercial effort."
"Poured a golden cloudy with a thick white head. Smelled mainly of spices with a little bit of floral hops. Taste was not as strong as the aroma would indicate. Overall a nice beer, not as good as some of the other Sam Adams seasonals."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a white head that laces the glass very well. It has a fruity and bready aroma that is pretty interesting. The taste is pretty good as well. It tastes of nice light malts as the backbone with citrisy fruits layered on top of hops. The mouthfeel is ok with a dry finish. The drinkability is pretty good but would be better if it didn't have such a dry finish."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a rather thick, dense white head. Smell is of pear and peach, and a touch of citrus. Taste is very fruity and with a dryness from the yeast. I was hoping for a touch more richness. A bit of--pleasant--cider taste. Nice, crisp mouthfeel. Good effort by SA, although I might actually save this for late spring/early summer."
"Another Walmart special. Picked up a six pack. This pours a clear dark yellow with a foamy head that leaves some lace on top. The nose is typical wheat/white. Spicy and wheat. The taste is pretty good. Some spice with fruit and bread. The mouthfeel is nice and bitey. Overall very easy to drink. I know, I had three of them tonight. But these are a little too sweet and a little too spicy."
"D - Nothing too special about this one, but would be nice on a hot summer day. It is refreshing. I would drink again."
"D - Very quaffable, I was glad to revisit one of the better beers in the Sam Adams lineup. This represents the style pretty well w/ an American affect. A very tasty beer, would be great in summer w/ refreshing qualities, but I could drink this year-round."
"D - I could probably drink a lot more of these if it were warmer out. I know this is their spring offering but come on; it's the first week of February for (JC) sake! Give it a try I guess, my wife can have other 5."
"The drink poured out as a light amber-like gold color with a thin head, and has an overall cloudy appearance. The smell is somewhat faint with spice and citrus aromas. The taste saves it from being a bit lackluster: really crisp citrus/mild lemon flavors wrapped around wheat. The carbonation aided the punch of the drink, making it a thirst quencher. Overall, it is average in some dimensions, but really good in others: I would recommend it."
"Pours a cloudy, yellow color, moderate carbonation. There is a strong citrus smell to this one. The mouthfeel is very smooth and there is a strong citrus, particulary lemon, present. There is some spice in the background which adds to the overall character of this beer. In my mind, a very refreshing brew. I've been waiting since last year to get this one again so it was definitely worth it."
"D:Since the body is so light it allows it to be an easy to drink beer. I didn't enjoy it too much, but it wasn't bad."
"D: This might make a better summer brew than one marketed as a spring transition brew. It is meant to be served ice cold on a steaming hot day. Short of that I doubt I would pick this Witbier up when so many other better options exist."
"drinkability is decent. the fruit and wheat malt would get to be a bit much after a couple bottles, though this is still a solid brew."
"The SA White is a good attempt at a Witbier.. but it sorta comes in steps.. never really coming together at any one time.. all in all.. I think it's pretty good, but still could benefit from a more assertive yeast and a little more dry finish."
"Overall, the beer was refreshing, and you get a lot out of it because of the complex and well balanced spice content which really makes the beer. I particularly like the hints of rose hips, which I think qualifies the beer for maybe a re-naming apart from a normal wit. Maybe something spring/valentine's day related? Still, very appropriate for the spring season whatever it's called."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt, coriander. The taste has less of the caramel notes, but they are still there. There is a faint hint of coriander. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but it is a bad representation of a witbier. There is too much caramel, and note enough coriander, or orange peel. I could drink this if it were the best beer available, but otherwise I will pass."
"I would not drink this normally but it is worth a shot with good beer flavor. If you are up to the challenge let the beer warm up a bit. If you don't mind the alcohol flavor, all the other elements really shine through."
"Easy to drink though. Won't buy again, because there are better options. But not a bad experience."
"Taste is similar to the smell, very citrusy and spicy, lots of carbonation though typical of the style but could be toned down a bit, very light hop bitterness if any, crisp and easy drinking. Always a good seasonal from Sam Adams to look forward to."
"Verdict: Obviously not the best witbier in the world. However, it's smooth, very drinkable and definitely worth a look see. You can't go wrong but if you want the best examples, you have to look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's a step up from macros."
"Drinkability - I would recommend it to anyone, and could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Lightly hazed yellow ochre color with an initially large white head that fades fairly quickly. Sweet perfumy aroma - lemon rind, coriander, and pepper. The flavor is sweet and floral with a hint of vanilla over wheat-y grain. Its missing the zestiness that I like in a witbier, but its pretty balanced and easy to drink. Smooth medium-ish body finishes surprisingly crisp. Not too shabby."
"Very drinkable for the ABV, on a spring day this is a great session beer."
"d - if it were not for the cherry wheat or cranberry lambic (maybe i have a thing against fruit beer) this would be the worst sam adams. It's not bad overall, but for a sam adams I expected more from the flavor category."
"Taste is almost nonexistent. Some citrus in there, maybe a lemony zest, but this is pretty darned close to carbonated water. Jut putrid. I'm surprised it's as highly rated as it is."
"Smooth and drinkable. Hazy almost dirty blond in color with some spices. I ordered another Sam Adams beer and they were out so they brought me this beer. I am not a huge fan of witbier and prefer Great Lakes Holy Moses While Ale. With that said I would have another beer."
"D: Not the best for the middle of winter, but probably great for a warm day. Pretty light, easy to drink, a good combination for a multi-beer session."
"Appearance is a hazy orangish grapefruit lookin with a crisp dissapating head. Smell and taste is very light in spice, citrus and malts, clean. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a good spike of carbonation that helps make it refreshing, but leaves a little saline in the aftertaste."
"Overall not a bad beer, wish it had more bite, but a good mass produced white ale. Pick up a six pack, one for grandmaster flash, the rest for the furious five."
"D - I really liked this brew I think I may have a new favorite seasonal from Sam Adams this is pretty good to the style definitely worth a try"
"pretty good witbier. lacking the ""belgian"" authenticity. could drink a few more. good for a day like today (balmy 43F). will buy more."
"When it arrived at my table it looked like a nice white beer, slightly cloudy in color, bright white head that lasted for a bit. It smelled fruity and light, with a subtle spiciness. My disappontment came when I tasted it. I suppose for a mid-summer beer it might be refreshing, but it seemed almost flat, and i don't mean the carbonation. It felt and tasted almost watery. Witbiers should have a hint of substance in the mouth, but this just tasted blah. Perhaps it was the weather, and I would have been better off with something along the lines of a Bells on that cold evening, but it just seemed to be missing some kind of kick. I know that whites are supposed to be mild, but this one just tasted bland. Definitely my least favorite offering from Sam Adams. It wasn't awful, I just think you can get a better witbier for your money (especially since they'll charge you $6.00 for a pint of this in Center city Philly)"
"D- Overall a pretty good beer. I think I would enjoy it more once the weather warms up and I'm looking for something a little more refreshing."
"d: Very refreshing, but I think I would get bored with it after a bottle or two. Not my favorite style to begin with, but this attempt isn't bad, maybe a bit above average."
"Pours a nice dark straw/light orange color with good head. Distinct scent, a nice wheat/straw scent, very clean, with hints of spice (orange and coliander?). Same with the taste, an almost crisp flavor with a little spiciness. Goes down fine, a different wheat beer, but not one I would want often."
"Gorgeous beer. Aggressive pour yields a beautiful large white head with great retention and very sticky lacing. Hazy orange copper liquid fills the pint. Orange and other citris on the nose with other sour fruits coming through. A little bit of spice shines through the end of the smell. Wheaty, yeasted, and a hint of orange. Taste is a little disappointing. It leaves something to be desired. Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated and a little creamy. Some wheaty fruitiness on the palate. This beer was worth the buy but I'm glad I got it as a single and not a sixer."
"Dark orange pour, cloudy, nice big white fluffy head, no bubbles. Sweet aroma of citrus, coriander, and malt. Looks heavy for a belgian white and smells a little of bananas...it almost seems more like a hefeweizen. Lots of spices in the flavor, almost overpowering. Not my favorite witbier, but still decent nonetheless."
"Beautiful creamy head and golden orangish color, head stayed around for a long time. Very refreshing and smooth. Can taste the orange peel in it, but has a unique taste. Thinner mouth feel than most wheat beers Ive had. Not great, but I think it is pretty high on the drinkability scale."
"D: Overall a let down. Spices seem odd for a wit beer. Coriander and crispness doesn't stand out enough. I didn't find this very this quenching either."
"This Witbeir has an appealing blonde shade and just looks quite tasteful; its hazy with plenty of carbonation and comes complete with a nice thin, almost white head on top and has some good lacing to it. The aroma is very pleasing and has some hints of wheat, oranges and lemons. This ale has a refreshing taste with a mild zing to it when it first hits your tongue, its really crisp and light with a bitter/citrusy taste overall, its mild aftertaste is just as tangy and is slightly more bitter but still very pleasing ."
"12 oz. bottle; brewed with 10 different herbs, spices and fruits (hibiscus, coriander, rose hip, orange peel, vanilla, tamarind, plum, lemon peel, anise, and grains of paradise). My first thought was that this brew would be overkill, but it turns out to be a pretty decent witbier. The beer pours opaque apricot, and is topped with a finger of light beige head. Nice malts in the nose, along with tangy wheat, floral notes, and some anise and vanilla. It is floral and fruity on the palate, with a peppery spiciness, coriander, perhaps some berries, a mild/medium bitterness, and anise and vanilla which make a cameo near the end. The body is light and lighlty carbonated, yet manages to remain smooth, and it imparts a medium finish. Fairly tasty, and sessionable for sure, but I feel it could have used a bit more oomph in the flavor department."
"Nice stab at Witbier; impressive American example. This was the first of this style I ever tried, and I really didnt like it back then. Today I really like it and would definitely have it again."
"Drinkability: A spring seasonal that would be welcome in my fridge in the summer. A nice refreshing easy drinker."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a murky golden orange color with a white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is wheat, citrus, corriander and orange peel. The taste features much of the same flavors as in the nose with a lot of wheat and some citrus that is smooth and crisp. Overall, this is a pretty decent stab at the witbier style. It certainly does not live up to some of the ones from Belgium, but it is a pleasant beer to drink. Recommended."
"Not my favorite Sam Adams - or White for that matter"
"Eric"
"D - Didn't think I would enjoy this beer as much as I did. It finds its way into the short list of Sam Adams beers that I actually enjoyed a lot."
"In appearance, it's a shade or two blonder than I expected, cloudy, with surpisingly good head retention. The spices used blend together pretty well, creating a crisp and refreshing beer. Some of the flavors remind me of fresh spring cut floral. A refeshing change of pace when you don't want an overpowering beer."
"extremely drinkable. very tasty but nothing special, but hey that's ok sometimes! Nice and simple."
"I had just had a god awful wit beer from another company so I decided to give this one a try. Surprise, surprise, this one while not as good as say hoogarden was an easy drinking wit beer without any real flaws. Not a whole lot there, not over the top in any one flavor, coriander in orange peel but was pretty was balanced. An easy drinking beer, one that would make a good lawn mower beer in the summer, refreshing."
"Hmmm... my first non-German wheat beer, and I'm not impressed. In a weitzen glass, the three finger head quickly dissipated to a thin lace. Smell was a crisp citrus; light but pleasant. Taste was about the same, very mild and with uncomplex flavors. Finishes nice. Not bad, but definitely not what I'm used to with wheat beers"
"Sam Adam's White Ale certainly isn't a bad beer by any means, but as far as the style goes, it's below average. The availability is nice because it's a far better choice than most of the chain restaurant's offerings, but I can not imagine buying this at a distributor with a good selection. Definitely not worth seeking out, but worth trying."
"Didn't quite live up to my expectations, but a pretty good spring beer."
"D: Pour me another one. Might as well... somebody's got to finish the six-pack!"
"D: A good try, but not my favorite witbier."
"Hazy, but a little clear for a wit style. Good head, but falls quickly and leaves a soap-looking cap. Aroma is somewhat lacking, there's some spicing and a yeast flavor that doesn't really fill the nose. I found the taste to be similarly light, but the spicing picks up the slack a little. It's a pretty straightforward wheat beer otherwise, just a hair watery, with maybe some dextrin character as it warms. Mouth is a little shy of full, finish turns a hint peppery, but it is easy to drink as long as the medicinal character doesn't get annoying for you."
"Don't drink and review."
"d - highly drinkable and very enjoyable. this is one i'll seek out on a hot day this spring and summer."
"Poured a pale yellow with a huge white frothy head. Nice carbonation bubbling up from the bottom. Decent lace left behind. Smell was very light, almost non existent grain and bread flavors. The taste was kind of blah, nice light fluffy feel, great outdoors in the summer beer, but for sitting down just too light and not enough character for me."
"Dry wheat finish."
"Malt seems to be more prominent in the taste, not wheat or spice. This doesn't much taste like a witbier, perhaps a light lager with lemon in it. Still, it's refreshing, but not a very good representation of the style."
"overall not a bad spring seasonal, just not interesting enough to get excited about. a nice choice to quench a thirst or pair with some food. hearty but without heart and soul. worth a shot every spring, especially when the weather is nice and the sun is shining."
"Had this at a local bar a little while ago. It poured an opaque, orange-like color tyical of a witbier with about a half inch white head that had ok retention. The head held fairly, reducing later on; nothing too impressive. The smell was a little fruity; essences were not as prevalent as I thought they would have been overall. The taste was fair; fruity and citrus like in nature with a little bit of a watery taste. Surprisingly, it was a little on the bitter side as opposed to a little bit on the sweeter side, typical of witbiers. It had a pretty thin mouthfeel, nothing very impressive that left too much of a lasting feeling in my mouth. Overall, fairly drinkable. A little more watery than a typical witbier, but still easy drinking."
"Light in color, an off-yellow transparent look to it. Very faint smell, wishit was stronger, but I could still sniff the citrus. Weiss-style taste, with various fruit flavors, including orange and some banana. Also a wheat taste to it. Overall, not too impressed with what I considered a weak taste, especially comparing this beer to other weiss beers. Drinkable, but still a bit too watery."
"Something I couldn't quite put my finger on made it tougher to drink as it progressed, enough that I wasn't getting another. Nothing really special about it, other than maybe the creaminess of the body, anyway."
"A real nice beer for this time of the year and into the summer."
"Pours a hazy yellow orange color. Head settles fairly quickly. Smells a bit yeasty, like rising bread and faint orange peel. Coriander flavor is somewhat less pronounced than other witbiers i've tried. Mouthfeel is nice and medium body. Carbonation is noticeable, but not overpowering. Has a nice texture to it. Its a very nice beer for an afternoon. I would certainly enjoy another one of these."
"I was pretty impressed by this wheat beer. It did not have an overwhelming wheat taste and was very refreshing and highly drinkable. Very mild coriander notes and the beer leaves a great aftertaste of golden delicious apple. The color was a cloudy honey with minimal head with some lacing. The mouth feel was a bit heavy with a decent amount of carbonation."
"Overall Impression: A strong example of the style. Again, low coriander flavor is a bit of a disappointment, but I could see enjoying these on a warm Spring day."
"Poured (maybe bartender could've done it better) with slight head and lace. Lace lasted all the way down. Nice hazy honey amber color. Nice carbonation. Mildly aromatic traditional white ale aromas - spicy, beery, a bit sweet. Flavor's the same but noticeable yeastiness. Good slightly sweet tangy finish."
"With Oberon & Whitsun this is one of the classic spring/summer brews. Sam Adams really has a winner here."
"Clean in the mouth, with little aftertaste. Actively carbonated."
"D - High. A great beer for late spring. I just wish they named it something a little more interesting than White Ale...I mean come on. What if the Guiness family called their beer ""Black Beer?"" And what if Bud and Miller called their products ""Colorless Swill."" That would make buying beer easy wouldn't it?"
"Cheers2beers"
"Poured a hazy light golden color with an attractive white fluffy head. Nice aromas of sweet spice and citrus with some faint dough. Delicious flavors of citrus orange peel, clove, anise, and mildy floral hops. Fine carbonation and creamy/smooth moutfeel. A definite winner from Sam Adams, so drinkable its almost ridiculous...I have yet to try a bottled version but some friends said it was not nearly as good. Either way this will be a perfect stand-by through the spring."
"All in all, a pretty good white beer."
"looks very nice. slightly darker maybe than average but nice. spicy nose with a kind of yeasty funk undertone. crisp taste, nice spice balance. definite slight yeasty malt finish. maybe orange and anise? very nice. not usually a huge sam adams fan but this one suprised me. really nice!"
"D-easy to drink and to session. Great spring beer!"
"D: DRINK DRINK DRINK!!!! it goes down SO easy you'll finish and be going for another in no time."
"Drinkability: This one isn't so bad, but it's not much of a traditional witbier."
"Overall, This is an easy beer to drink. It didn't fill me up after three. I give this an overall thumbs-up."
"Samuel Adams White Ale was a yellow-brown color and very cloudy. It had a short white head that soon became a thick collar which lasted until the beer was gone. The aroma was wheat and yeast with some spices thrown in. The taste was light malt and wheat with some spice in the backround and a dry finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkabilty was good. This is a refreshing springtime brew."
"Decent brew but not one of my favorites."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light hazy yellow, forming two fingers worth of head, and medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is sweet citrus with a hint of wheat. The taste is smooth fruit flavors, with a good amount of spices, and a light taste of wheat in the aftertaste. Light and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, I have tasted very few beers that have this smooth of a finish. I was really suprised by this one. I could easily session this beer. Another great beer from Samuel Adams."
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel with light tangyness. Goes down easily,could drink a couple no problem, just not all day Enjoyable,good taste a slight bit on the bland side a good beer overall"
"The body is relatively light and goes down smoothly."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice straw gold color, very cloudy. HUGE white fluffy head. Lacing was like soapy water that lasted throughout the entire drink. Looks are far above the taste as this thing was very nice to look at. The smell was slightly citrus with some grassy tones. Tasted the same with a slightly bitter aftertaste, but overall too mild and almost bland. Some yeasty after thoughts to it as well, nothing to write home about. It's ok, probably better on a hot day in the shade, I wouldn't seek this beer out."
"One stand out characteristic that I noted was a slight grain / tanin note that I did not expect. Not so much as to be offensive, but not quite what I would expect in a witbier."
"The color was darker than I expected for a Witbier, but the beer was appropriately cloudy. The smell was refreshing - a light spicyness and citrus aroma. The carbonation level makes the beer very refreshing. Combine that with the citrus flavors on the wheat base and you get a very drinkable beer. There isn't enough strength to the flavor to make this one outstanding, but I would definitely have it again - would be a great summer thirst quencher and something you could serve that would work for all your guests."
"drinkability - Only comes around Spring time, nice and refreshing beer. had this on tap last night. Witbier beers are one of my favorite beers."
"The mouthfeel is too watery, but still has a faint crispness. This beer is easy to drink, as are almost all witbiers, but for a white ale it could be more sessionable."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on the back label. Poured a cloudy yellow color that was much darked than most wits I've seen. It had a good sized head that settled to a thin film. The smell had the expected spices and orange peel but a lot of malt as well which hard it in my opinion. The taste followed the smell and again was hurt by the maltiness. Mouthfeel was good. Overall, it's not a bad beer but just doesn't excite me and have me craving another. For a mass market wit, I'd much rather go with Blue Moon. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"pours a cloudly golden color with a two finger white tight bubbled head and nice sticky lacing. fruity floral aromas. taste is coriander, lemon, and spices and pepper all balanced into a great taste. mouthfeel light and smooth, full bodied. great session beer definitely on the list for hot weather enjoyment."
"Pours to a hazy orange with a decent head. This White Ale really lacks in the aroma department which I expect to be powerful in a ""spicy"" Belgian wheat. Ripe, citrus fruits come through in the taste and are very pleasant. Carbonation is where it should be and the mild aftertaste mimics the rest of the experience. I would certainly drink this beer again, but I don't think I'd ever crave it."
"D: Not to sound too cheesy here, but every sip of this beer tastes just like spring. Seriously, reminds me of a nice spring afternoon when things are really just starting to bloom, very nice on this cool late winter/early spring evening. This brew goes great with a chicken and rice dish."
"I was a little disappointed. I guess I was expecting a bit more boldness, even for a summer ale, from Sam Adams"
"I found this offering to be incredibly average. There wasn't any distracting off flavors, but I couldn't find anything to get excited about either. Drinkable, but nothing to bother seeking out. There are too many good witbiers to spend much time on this one."
"Pale golden and hazy in color, with a white head skimming the top of the glass, and minimal-to-moderate lacing. Tall pour! Although served in a non-chilled tumbler, it was refrigerator-standard 'cold from draught', so I wasn't able to appreciate the nose as much as I might have liked. I immediately detected a funky, off-odor, as if soured or pickled, which is the common sort of bacterial infection/infestation of the tap or line that I find in a number of bars. Aside from that, there's a natural sweet/sour character to this beer, along with the expected (Belgian I assume) yeast character which is pleasant. The nose did improve as the beer warmed in my hand (I had two in a row : ), as did the taste, and to that end the real treat is in the tasting. Sweet/sour/tangy on the first sip, which seems to be a short and dry sip. Pale, bready, and biscuity malts provide the sweetness and add to the smooth and creamy body, aided of course by the suspended yeast. Notes of banana and (light) clove . . . Not quite medium-bodied. There's great balance between the sweet and tangy, neither one pushes it's weight too much. I'll note that the 'off-nose' did not affect the drinkability. Light citrus notes of lemon rind and ripe tangerine. Only a touch spicy and a bit ""soapy"" in agood way. Would make for a good pair with lighter entrees and a better pair (as a foil) to spicy, hot dishes. The last time I had this was several years back, bottled, and I believe I only made mental notes, but it fairly impressed me at the time. I'll definitely try it again, in either format. Another winner from BBC / Samuel Adams."
"This is probably the only spring seasonal I look forward to each year. My basement used to smell like this beer after I dropped a 12 pack and some soaked into the carpet. It's not world class, but is a nice change after the heavy barleywines of winter. I like that it is not over-the-top spicy, but has enough interesting things going on to keep me interested."
"A pretty average white, I'll probably avoid in the future with so many better versions out there."
"Overall, a decent beer, nothing spectacular though. I am generally not much of a Sam Adam's fan; that said this fits perfectly with their middle of the road philosophy."
"The nose is interesting -- a little spicy. A bit of orange. Some bittering hops. Nothing that wows you, though. Taste is actually a little abrasive on the tongue. A weird bittering things going on here, which might be due to the spices. Is there a bit of mint in there? Something green and Earthy, anyways. Mouthfeel is light to medium and drinkability is good, but not great."
"A nice beer, but I wish there was more to it. They need to make this beer just as it is -- only more so."
"Had this on tap at the Beachhouse in Cadriff. cloudy hazy yellow, minimal head which disappeared quickly. Not much smell to speak of. Taste was mildly bitter with a tiny coriander taste that you have to really strain to notice. Not a bad beer, not particularly outstanding either. This would seem like a good session beer for a warm day when you arent looking for anything too strong."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow, with a decent white head - nose of over ripe bananas , orange peel , cake , spices mainly clove , bubblegum , and some yeastyness  taste of yeast , sour milk , oats , and mint - body is smooth with some bite  aftertaste of yeast , and slight chewyness"
"Pours a hazy, unfiltered, golden orange with a nice white head and good lacing. Nose is citrusy, spicy (perhaps corriander), and of grain. Taste is lemony citrus, the aforementioned spice with a nice wheat bite to it. Spices are at a nice level where they arent overpowering but noticeable, and the citrus is refreshing making this a nice bridge from cold weather to the warmer months. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty smooth. Definitely an easy drinker. Overall this is a pretty nice spring seasonal from BBC."
"Not at all bad. Could put away several of these in a setting. I'd prefer a Hoe, but I'd gladly take this if offered."
"D: I could drink about three of these throughout the night (or day)."
"Overall, this beer was quite clean, crisp, refreshing and easy drinking, despite its lack of complexity and flavor."
"Murky light yellow body with about an inch of white head. Smells like orange and spice with a kind of peach quality to it. Tastes citrusy and spicey with some yeast a floral quality. Has kind of a slick mouthfeel to it IMO. Not my favorite witbier..."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, and drinking this now gives me hope that warmer days are coming. I'm sure I'll pick this up again at some point."
"Good Witbier to convert non-craft beer people, not too full of flavor like Blanch De Chambly. Overall, another decent beer from the mini-macro Sam Adams."
"Probably more drinkable on a warm spring day, but the drinkability suffers on a cold winter sunday afternoon."
"Samuel Adams White Ale pours a hazy golden color with a very thin head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is appropriate for a white ale, coriander is definitely noticeable. Coriander is barely noticeable in the flavor however, citrus really isn't very noticeable either. Wheat is really the predominant flavor. Not unpleasant, but not really what I expect in a wit either."
"This was the last of the Sam Adams seasonals I have had and although I enjoy the other three more I will probably have more of these this spring. I'm not familiar with unfiltered beers but after trying this I'm very open to trying some."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: This beer goes down easy. It's pretty light. If I was a bigger fan, I could drink a few these. I'm just not that big of a fan. Overall, it's drinkable. But definitely not one of Sam Adams better offerings."
"Notes--Not my style of choice to be sure, so my ratings may be a little lower than the beer deserves. It did go very nicely with a spicy General Tso's chicken."
"DA: This wouldn't be bad on a VERY hot day, just relaxing on the edge of a river...but it's February, 12 degree's outside and this beer is making me mourn for summertime."
"Leave the Witbier to the Belgians Mr. Koch."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color. The smell is sour and cereal like with some spice notes. The taste is grainy and a bit sour. The mouthfeel is medium and carbonated. This is a drinkable beer in that it is not offensive; however, it could be more flavorful."
"D - it's drinkable but I'm really not much of a witbier guy."
"I can have a few of these, and it is a good spring beer, for drinking outside when it's rainy and not that warm yet. Nothing too deep going on, not as complex as I'd remembered it unfortunately. I like the labels too (hey I'm just saying). A little pricey though. Let it warm up."
"Pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a nice white head. It certianly looks unfiltered as advertised. Smells of citric fruit and spice, slight lemon but orange really dominates the nose. Pretty much what I'd expect from a Wit, maybe a little subdued. Taste is a bit flat. Nice malty tones stick around the entire time with a slight citric tinge and the only bitterness comes from what I presume would be the corriander or orange peel. Couldn't find the hops in this one. This is fairly balanced and drinkable with a nice amount of carbonation, a nice easy and solid offering."
"The taste is similar to the aroma. Fruity, spicy, but never overpowering or bitter. Hopping is at a minimum. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth. Really this is a fine, refreshing beer that is highly drinkable and quite sessionable. A solid, thirst-quenching anytime beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It's light flavorful and refreshing. I wouldn't mind having the beer any time of year."
"D - I rated drinkability highest on the beer because I can honestly imagine myself enjoying this anytime (spring/summer)... And I guess winter too (I just finished my 2nd!)"
"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch frothy white head. It smells like orange, lemon, coriander and a bit of grain. The beer tastes mostly like orange and grain, with a bit of coriander, pretty much tastes the same way it smells. Mouthfeel is light, and the beer is smooth and crisp. Drinkability is OK, but I don't know if I'd want to drink more than 2-3 of these at a time. Overall I think it's an OK beer, it wouldn't be a bad choice to drink on a hot day."
"12 oz brown bottle with best by 06/07. Pours a chunky bright, hazy amber with a great creamy head. This is one good looking beer! Most of the yeast was already suspended in the bottle, there was no visible yeast layer on the bottom of the bottle. Good lacing with a nice, tan rocky head with good retention. The smell is of mild citrus and spice with a little yeastiness in the nose. Lemon, Orange, hints of coriander and yeastiness come through in the taste. Nothing overpowering, just well balanced and tasty. Very little in the way of hop bitternesss. This one could become one of my favorites."
"D- Pretty good. This is a great spring beer. I can really picture myself drinking this on a cool spring evening."
"Overall very drinkable, a flavorful beer that is light and refreshing. One of my favorites and the perfect springtime beer."
"This is a good beer. I haven't had many whites,but this ranks near the top of the ones I have had."
"Though not a bad beer, it is really lacking in the smell & taste deparments. To me it just comes across quite bland, and the spices are hard to notice. As a beer it works fine, but not as a witbier."
"Nice golden haze body with a peppery citrus aroma. A lot of flavor going on with a spicy aftertaste. You can add an orange slice to kick up the flavor - but if you have strong taste buds you can already taste the orange peel that was added during the brewing process. Stacks up well verse the competition that is currently out available on draft in many establishments. Try it verse Hoegaarden - the Caddilac or Witbiers."
"D: I generally put wits into one of two categories: the Hoegaarden clones, and the Blue Moon wannabes. There are exceptions, obviously, but that's where most of them lie. Sam White Ale happens to be an exception. It's a bit more fragrant than those two, and it has different aromas than they do. It's recognizable as a wit, but it's spicier. A pretty solid beer."
"The bottle boasts this brew as a brewers spice rack with ten spices included in the beer plus orange peel and coriander. It challenges you to identify them all. A challenge that is quite tough considering the potency of flavor coming from this beer. It pours a cloudy light orange with a white head that faded quickly. Smells mostly of citrus, wheat, and many sweet notes. It smells of a variety of fruit, I cannot pull out orange distictly, but it is in there. The taste is sweet with wheat as expected, and finishes clean with more body than expected. The carbonation adds a creamy texture, and is very subtle. The balance of the beer is done well, especially mixing all those flavors into one. This one is an easy drinker, even with the strong flavor, which usually get annoying, this one stays crisp and refreshing. Very enjoyable, another good one from Sam. Cheers."
"A decent witbier, however there are better ones out there (in my opinion, such as Hoegaarden). Worth a try."
"A couple years ago, I really liked this beer. It's a sweet, light colored wheat beer. It's a little different than it's unfiltered cousins. You would never mistake a Sam White for a Harpoon UFO. In comparison, Sam tastes like candy. But the same thing that attracted me to the beer in the first place, now drives me away. The low hop ratio, the odd sweetness, the diversion from style gets a bit tired. I would still order it on tap when it magically appears in the winter. But I no longer horde cases in the basement. It's a good beer but not great."
"Pretty basic witbier. Somewhat darker in color than some other examples. Good head retention and lacing - better than most. Typical nose of coriander and dried citrus rind over a grainy, wheatish malt. In the mouth it's crisp, smooth, and lightly dextrinous. The flavor is again fuller than some, but with more malt than spice or orange peel. Nice. Gently tangy. Nice spice profile that's more than just coriander. Finishes dry and refreshing with a light smear of spice and yeast. As usual, another very good offering from Sam Adams."
"Poured into a glass, is a reddish brown in appearance with a fluffy carmel colored head that stays the entire drink. Smell is very slight with hints of sweet figs and wheat. Taste is highly carbonated with sweet after finish, it is similar to the old fezzywig imo, but more carbonated. This is a good offering from Sam Adams, very refreshing and smooth."
"Drinkability/Overall: A whole lot going on, and a bit unfocused for a wit. Very much in the vein of their Summer Ale or Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. Could be worse, but not much of a wit."
"I think it works. I mean I wouldn't drink it everyday but I really is good. Lots of flavor but not overpowering and it goes great with a very cheesy pizza from Papa John's. (Don't worry I had a beer for reviewing first.)"
"Whitish colour, nice head. Spicy yeasty scent. Easy smooth mouthfeel, creamy, on sweet side though not cloying. Orange,apple, pear, allspice, only a drop of corriander. Very drinkable with good spiciness.Heres an underrated beer that In would have again."
"Purchased in bottle in Menomonee Falls, WI. Sam Adams White Ale is a citrusy, spicy wheat beer similar to Blue Moon. More golden than I anticipated, the flavor was subdued at first but grew as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was bubbly, with a touch of carbonation to add bubbleness to the already bubbliness. Too carbonated to be a true Belgian wit-style beer, but decent for the price."
"I reccomend drinking this beer soon after purchasing (to avoid clumpyness), and I also feel it is enjoyed best alone, as opposed to with a meal."
"Poured somewhat robustly, produced a nice head that dissipated slowly and a beer with a pale amber color with the obligatory cloudiness. The aroma is a bit weak, I detect a hint of spicy coriander (or maybe the label suggests it) but not much else. The flavor is good, not as dry as desired but it does have a slight spicy tart bite at the end that is nice. Mostly I get malt on the sweet side and a little other complexity, fruity flavors like apples and lemons (the latter comes through with that tart bite I mentioned). This is OK, I don't think its complex enough or dry enough to be a witbier but its kind of like Blue Moon except better than that from what I remember. Kind of like an Americanized witbier (although maybe that would have a good dose of bold hops, that's an idea for homebrewing some time...)"
"Prost! MK"
"This one is my favorite out of the four Sam Adams Seasonals, especially on-tap. Also if youre buying bottles, its definitely worth stocking up on it around late-May early June when the stores are trying to get rid of their leftovers."
"overall- i was pretty impressived with this offering from sam adams. Kind of like a more flavorfull blue moon. i went through about 10 of these over the course of a evening/night barbeque without ever getting tired of the flavors. at $12 a 12pack its hard to beat the price too."
"Pours a a hazy, almost artificially yellow color with a 1 finger head that is gone in under a minute. Aroma is somewhat weak, with traces of coriander, lemon, banana, and lightly nutty yeast. Taste is somewhat disappointing in this bottle, with the above-mentioned flavors prevalent Taste is almost somewhat watered-down. There is also a trace of a metallic flavor that I can't pin down. Mouthfeel is nice and carbonated, but again somewhat watery somehow. Pretty drinkable on a hot day. Not too bad."
" Between the Octoberfest, Holiday Porter, Dopplebock, and this, Boston Brewing has some real winners among their brewing portfolio. I always look forward to seasonal releases and this beer, along with the Flying Fish Octoberfish, the Troegs Sunshine Pils' and Oatmeal Stout, and the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, is always worth the wait. Spring just wouldn't be the same without this!"
"D: This beer is very easy drinking and flavorfull. I kind of can't believe that this beer has a score of only 82 because this is an excellent beer in my opinion. I haven't had too many Wit Beers better than this one."
"Chamomile, ginger, orange and curacao aroma, with hints of peaches and pears, fairly expressive, but not very nice smelling. Hazy orange color with a full head. Allspice and ginger flavors, with medicinal elements. Overspiced. Not much of a white ale."
"Pours golden with orange hue. Creamy head with decent retention and nice lace.Smell is of citrus, and spice. Body is medium, with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is of spice and fruit. Nice balance. The carbonation gives it a bit of an edge. Good stuff."
"This one from Sam Adams is a keeper. Definitely one of their best Seasonals. I definitely can see myself knockin' several of these back after mowing the lawn this spring."
"My only consern is that it is a little bit too carbonated. it would be so much smoother with less carbonation, but overall a very good choice."
"Pours a bright, hazy amber with a great creamy head. Most the yeast was already suspended in the bottle, there wasn't a cake on the bottom like with other wits; it was not shaken either. Very good lacing and head retention, which is expected. The smell is not strong at all, but there is some citrus and mild yeastiness in the nose. Lemon, Orange, hints of coriander and yeastiness come through in the taste. Nothing overpowering and very little bitterness. I could definitely drink a few of these in the hot Florida springs."
"Drinkability? yes, and im not going to take the mower route but rather say its a good welcome to spring!"
"Overall, not a bad beer, but it's probably not one I would purchase again."
"Some wheat beers go a bit far with the yeastiness in my opinion. However this did it just right. It had a nice foamy head too. Hmmm I wish I had one right now."
"The worse part? It's only available in the spring...That's it? This beer should be on the shelves year round. A review of 82 does nothing to tell you about how incredible this citrus delight is, and I recommend it a thousand times over to anyone who is looking for something that smells, tastes and drinks as near to perfect as I can ask for."
"Just tried this recently during the brewery tour in Boston. Looks like a typical wheat beer, but a little darker than you would expect. Mild nose with very subitle hops. Taste was very good. It had the lemon zest that I expected, but also a very subitle taste of pepper. Overall, this year's batch is very good."
"I really enjoyed this. Its like an amped up Hoegaarden. I wish some Sam Adams seasonals would make their way up to Toronto."
"Drinkability  SA almost always delivers in this category. Nothing fancy here, lots of flavor and really drinkable. Another good gateway beer from SA."
"It is in fact a great spring beer and I've been enjoying it as such plentily."
"I had this beer on tap and it had a small head that dissipated very quickly. The color was an opaque yellow/orange and had a few little streamers in it from the yeast. The aroma smelled like a classic hefe weizen and the taste was very similar with plenty of body to it. It had a citrus fruitiness to it as well and a low hop bitterness. The mouthfeel had a medium consistancy with medium carbonation. I felt that the drinkability was very good and had a crisp taste with a good finish. I usually like a little bit more spice with my hefe weizens (personal preference), but this was still a superb beer that I would reccomend trying."
"Pours a lovely hazy orangish gold under a very thick two finger off-white head that lingers well and leaves superb lacing. The nose is subdued, but the spices are there - mint, coriander, perhaps a touch of coffee. The mouth is very prickly and deceptively light yet sticky. The flavors are smooth and mild, starting with wheat and fruit, then moving through the spice (is that ginger in there somewhere?) and ending with a nice little kick of dry bitter hops. The aftertaste is dominated by the spice, with a touch of cinnamon joining the others. Overall a pleasant experience and a worthy spring quaffer."
"I am a huge fan of the Sam Adams Seasonal brews. This is one of my favorites. Pours a cloudy amber color and has a nice light head. For a widely available commecially brewed beer it has very complex flavors and aromas. The start is a little fruit follwed by some spice. Finishes nicely and is very easy to drink."
"Body is between light and medium, with a fizzy mouthfeel and watery finish. Still easy to drink."
"Amber, cloudy orangeish in color. Not much of a head. Fruity and flowery in smell and taste. A clean and easy drinking beer. Light, yet a bit of an aftertaste. Better than average, as I would expect from BBC. A decent beer, but after a couple I found that I would stick with the Boston Lager."
"Overall: An outstanding witbier, definitely recommended."
"review updated 3-2-2007"
" I wish I lived at the Sam Adams brewery! I worship the guys who work there. I highly recommend the tour. It will definately be the freshest beer you will ever have."
"It was a beer that I will most likely drink again because, like others I've had, it is my favorite among others to choose from. It's not my favorite beer, but it's not the worst to date! I would definitely not pick it as my favorite white. This was on-tap, so I might try it in the bottle to give it another chance."
"Creamy and sweet, but this one was predominantly spicy with peppar and coriander. Not bad, with some floral hops, just not awe inspiring. Those same attributes drew back on any drinkability rating."
"Cloudy straw yellow. Pours a thin, filmy head. Smells of yeast, biscuits and fruit--appealing. Light on taste yet surprisingly malty. Taste is sweetish but balanced, and it's definitely more Blue Moon than Hoegaarden (the latter of which I don't care for). Light and crisp hop aftertaste. Very creamy, thick, full, and heavy in mouthfeel, but slightly mild in carbonation--a little more wouldn't hurt. Exceptionally acessible and drinkable for a wide audience of beer drinkers--not your average swill. Possibly too tame for other craft drinkers, but I just may start stocking this at my place."
"Great Beer. Hands Down."
"D: Its an ok beer nothing special and would drink it again if offered but i dont think i would buy it."
"D: Not a great Witbier imo, don't think I would buy it again with the other choices that are out there."
"Overall, it's not all that bad ... but if they got some control over all of those tannins it'd be a much more appealing brew."
"I'm not much into witbiers, but this was pretty good. It was a cloudy orange color with a medium-sized white head and some nice lacing. It had a sweet, fresh odor. It tasted fruity with some spice, and a tiny bit of hops. Very pleasant, very drinkable."
"Poured a very cloudy golden orange colour. Head was white and thin which dissipated quickly, but left some lacing in the glass. Aroma was a little sweet, with fruit, spices and perhaps a little yeast noticeable. Lots of citrusy fruit flavours with light coriander and other spices, but without any of them being overpowering. I'm not typically a big fan of Witbier, but I certainly enjoyed this one. Very well balanced and very drinkable. I'll certainly drink it again (and already have)."
"I tried this beer last night at my favorite watering hole (Summits in Sandy Springs). It pours into a barrel mug a strange orange color with a 1/4"" head that lasts with decent lacing. Since I had just finished a AB Spring Heat Spiced Wheat, I felt a great sense of deja vu. I figured that Sam Adams would be a lot different. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The smell of this beer was far weaker and had a musty and grassy scent. The taste is of corn, stale marshmallows, earth, and has a backwash tanginess at the end that I didn't like. The mouthfeel was light to medium with a fizzyness to it. I don't think I will be drinking this beer anytime soon. This is my least favorite of the Sam Adams beers (and I love a great many of them)."
"Hopefully just a bad batch, considering everything I've read in the good reviews is what i tend to look for in a beer. Give me another, just not on tap at the local watering hole..."
"People are rating this low and I don't know why, I think they are losing sight that we comapre against style and not all of beerdom. When it comes to great tasting, drinkable wit's, this is about as good as it gets. I wish this was around for summer also and not just spring."
"Pleasant...actually nice...could session this but I think I would rather look for a Hoegaarden. Something about this felt and tasted a little too much like a Macro trying their hand at a seasonal. Close...but not really there."
"Alright. We have here a dark orange white beer that smells like corn chips and tastes like marshmallows and orange zest and is way to heavy. Sam, you missed the mark by a long shot."
"The key, as with Sam Adams' Cherry Wheat beer, to find a food that counters its sweetness with saltiness or bitterness."
"Although it lacks much, what really would've made this slightly bearable is if it would've had that certain ""brightness"" I tend to associate with wits. It's like drinking a girly cocktail, so if that's your thing, then go balls to the wall with Sam Adams White Ale."
"First witbier of the year, I was definitely ready for one, and Sam Adams actually does a really good job with this seasonal. Pours a bright but muddy orange, looks like a screwdriver almost, no real head but a nice spidery lacing left behind on the glass. Nose is a light wheat malt with some slight spices, corianders the only one jumping out. Taste starts out with this spicy coriander, gives way to a smooth wheat malt with fruity hints of lemon and orange, finishes with a burst of allspice and clove. Medium bodied, high carbonation, nice and refreshing. This is a really good beer that can be found a lot of places, a flavorful and refreshing brew, one of Sams better seasonals."
"So, absolutely not. While Blue Moon is a mild beverage that is good every once in a while, this was drinkable, but nothing I'd get again."
"As far as drinkability is concerned, well, once I finished off the glass, I reached for it again and was disappointed to find it empty; which resutled in me immediately getting another from the fridge. Two thumbs up."
"It's an interesting Wit, a nice attempt, but it's very unfocused. The odd spice flavors once noticed become very distracting. Drinkable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"Overall, I found this to be slightly underdone for the style, but it is highly refreshing and certainly worth a try--in other words, a passable but by no means exceptional wit."
"D- I had 16 oz of this beer and culd have had many more. The drinkability of this beer is as ussual where this SA beer shines. A smooth spring offering this is another triumph from SA."
"This brew is while not typical of its' genre is still very good, and very thirst quenching. This would make a great summer brew."
"Looks like a witbier should. Pale golden color, very hazy and cloudy. Nose is spicy- citrusy and wheaty. Cloves, maybe coriander. Taste is a mishmash of things... lots of wheatyness, lots of spices, lots of earthyness. Interesting- not offensive- but not really lovely either. Overwhelming bready. Mouthfeel is alright- on the watery side, but otherwise okay. Fairly drinkable- but not my favorite Sam Adams."
"drinkability: very"
"Appearance is a hazy orange, with a light white inch head. Slight lacing on the pint glass. Smell is citrusy--orange and faint traces of pineapple. The taste also continues the orange trend, with even traces of apple and apricot (?). Mouthfeel is slightly heavy, but not overbearingly so. Drinkability is good as this is a very tasty beer and would be a good 'go-to' beer if you're feeling like something with a 'fruity' flavor that's not a fruit/vegetable style beer."
"I love this beer, I do like white ales as a wholebut this is one of my favorites over all. This ale pours a yellowish brown, thick you can not see through this beer always a good sign. The head is thick white and foamy. The taste is polite and clean has what they refer to as mouthfeel, this beer will not over power foods that are by most lagers or darker ales. over all Great unfiltered Belgian white ale."
"Pretty much what I expect from Sam Adams: Clean, well crafted, true to style, enjoyable beers. Though the aren't pushing too many boundaries, they know what they are doing. Winter white is citrusy and silky smooth from sip to finish. Oranges, corriander, esters, and tropical fruits show boldly iin the nose and flavor. Very soft and velvety on the toung. Ligthly and softly spicy through to the finish. Very clean and refreshing even into the aftertaste."
"Mash comes through fairly raw. Not for me gang."
"Hazy light gold body with a very tall head with very good retention. Nice lacing too. Smells of corriander and citrus. Kind of heavy on the corriander, as is the taste, a spicey flavor dominated by the corriander but also has lemon and orange citrus. Very smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable. Not the best witbier, but great for the price compared to Allagash White or Ommegang Witte."
"Lays heavy and thick in the mouth. Its heavier and more unusual than most witbiers. One of the few witbiers I'd drink year-round. Like Vuuve, it's extra-ordinary in its style category."
"A bland and very artificial tasting beer. Not a wit that I'll return to."
"I remember I bought a case of this in college about 8 years ago. I was like ""No wonder this stuff isnt good. Its all cloudy and has dirt on the bottom. Is this like 10 years old or something?"" Funny the things we remember. I hated it then but really enjoy this beer now. Thanks Sammy!"
"Overall: I like this Ale with a snack or by itself and I can drink more than 2 at a sitting, bring it to your poker night."
"D- I'd much rather have the Winter Lager. I won't get it again."
"Pours a cloudy, vibrant, medium amber-orange with a small, slightly off-white, tight head with good retention. Attractive intricate lacing. The beer was served REALLY cold, but that didnt mute the rather full nose too much. Huge wheat aromas, strawberry, cilantro, orange. The taste is big as well, with berry battling it out with cereal for top billing. Light sweetness fades into a citrus and herbal, lightly dry finish. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. This is not an every-day, easy-drinking ale, but its wonderfully complex for the style. Good for the mood I was in at the time of tasting this beer, but possibly a bit too much if you are looking for a more traditional witbier."
"This Sam just popped up at my local vendor so I ventured a quaff. Poured into a chalice it is a beautiful translucent honey yellow. The head is tan and strong with great lacing. The smell is tantalizing with the ibiscus being most prevalent. Many other fruit flavors are present. The taste is the most ""sparkly"" belgian I have ever imbibed to date. Mouthfeel is a cornucopia of flavors with a carbonation that delivers like Fedex. Great recipe. Anything with Sam's name on it delivers. I am enjoying this brew immensely, it's a sessioner. No doubt."
"Medium bodied and nicely carbonated, a very drinkable beer, but not a witbier as far as I'm concerned."
"At a local Friday's very glad when the served it without the ctrus wedge you get with some whites and hefe's. Very cloudy muddy brown water with a delicate white hat the laces the whole 22 oz glass. Smell is of wheat and hints of sulfur and bigger notes of citrus. Jim and Co. did this one right in the taste, not to sulfury form the yeast and nice well blended taste of white and subte citrus tones and a spice from a low dose of hops. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable, in fact I am going back tonight for more."
"A bit weak for the style but this is all around a pretty well crafted brew. This could definately be an eye opener for some."
"Ok first of all the first thing that comes to my mind when I drink this beer is liquid bread. The smell and the taste is just yeast and wheat. Ok so when this beer is poured, the color is hazy slightly burnt orange. There is a sizeable foamy head that dissapates quickly but leaves a ring of foam residue around the rim of the beer. The smell is primarily yeast and wheat as said before. The taste is the same along with some bitter orange peels and maybe a few other spices that I cannot distinguish. As compared to their hefeweizen, this certainly displays a more spicy characteristic than a citrusy fruity one. The mouthfeel is a good thickness and carbonation. Overall I find this to be a pretty drinkable beer and one that I could enjoy each spring."
"This pours a cloudy orange with a large head that disappears quickly. The smell is very peppery with alot of wheat and lemon. The taste is crisp and refreshing with alot of carbonation. The flavors are dominated by the wheat,lemon,and coriander,pepper. The m/f is light and well balanced which makes this a very drinkable beer that I will look forward to each spring."
"pretty good and drinkable, best is warm weather."
"Verdict- It's my first witbier, and I like it. It's light enough to be a refreshing hot day beer, but it's also reasonably complex."
"D - This is an easy drinker that's got good flavor without the heaviness and overt sweetness of maltier fare. An excellent entry for this style."
"A tad too much alcohol (5.2) for a *proper* session brew, but what the hell  close enough for government work. Drink em up! Especially with the low American price versus an import  looking forward to getting the bottled version."
" This is what it is, but I won't go out of my way for one of these in the future, especially with Hoegaarden increasingly available out here in suburbia."
"2006 release. Pours golden, opaque with disturbed sediment and lots of tiny rising bubbles. Two finger head, dense and creamy, holds exceptionally well. Immaculate sticky lace. Mild notes of wheat, citrus, and faint clove or coriander in the nose. Lots of wheat and yeast flavor, with a slightly puckering lemon zest. Aftertaste is dry, with some acute coriander spice to balance the wheat and citrus fairly well. Full bodied, with a fine carbonation that is not quite crisp, but very smooth. Good drinkability, with a interesting tart character, another above average seasonal from Sammy Adams."
"Another good beer from Boston Brewing Company."
"poured a cloudy light amber color with massive white puffy head. Smell is mildly fruity with notes of spices. Spiciness comes throught in the taste, as does a graininess. Finish is thirst quenching, but not much else. Average at best. There are better witbiers around."
"This is a great hot summer beer."
"A seasonal brew from Sam Adams. Date of Jul/05. Pours a cloudy yellow with a very nice head and lacing. Scent of sweet, which is reminiscent of this style (White Ale). This is a nice version of the style from Sam Adams Nice light feel with a great after taste. This is a very social brew, many can be had."
"Pour is of a hazy medium copper color-darker than I am used to wwith this style. Head is very full and carries a slightly off white tinge. Carbonation level is also high and true to style. Nose carries a strong peppery aroma, no other spices detected, maybe a slight hint of yeast. Flavor picks up the peppery notes and adds some maltiness to them. Finish is long peppery intro and then a long dry finish. Drinkable, a strange spiciness for style, and somewhat one dimensional."
"Pours a very hazy shade of orange, which is to be expected for the style. Very nice medium bubble white head. Smells of sweet orange peal, but not overpowering. I very much like the smell. Somewhat heavy body. Light spicy flavor, typical of Belgians, but subdued. Maybe due to the unexpected heaviness of the body. The heaviness is almost distracting since I was not expecting it. Aftertaste is minty Like the aftertaste from eating wild spearmint and washing it down with a beer. I really liked this beer, but found it out of place in the spring and summer lineup. To me, this is a fall beer. Again, a bit too heavy for spring or summer fare but perfect for an autumn festival. I plan to buy at least a six pack to sit for the coming of fall."
"Notes: Some reason it tasted better than the first time I reviewed it. Mood? Scenario? I don't know, but tis odd. How much weight shall we put into reviews?"
"The taste is very disappointing, though. Between all of the above spicey notes, this is one hell of an overly spiced beer. The finish is very parched and dry. This is not something I would even think of sessioning on, thus it makes a shitty seasonal brew for late spring or early summer in my opinion. The spiciness is way over the top."
"This is a rather refreshing beer, and leaves a bit of a sweet taste in my mouth. Again, like I was just drinking orange juice. I could certainly drink more of these."
"Taste: Different from what I am use to, you know when you have a beer and say this isn't that bad then when you have a few more you change your mind. So this could be a two beer limit."
"for some reason this beer just struck a chord with me. maybe it's the long time i've been waiting to sample this beer that has made me throw away logic and give this beer my highest rating thus far. i don't know? maybe it's just a damn good beer. who cares, i like it alot. buy it!"
"Sam Adams does an excellent job with their ""specialty"" beers. This White Ale has a very full flavor to it, almost orangy in flavor and texture. Extremely drinkable, not much smell to it is it's only downfall but an excellent brew overall."
"While Samuel Adams White Ale is nothing that will make your jaw drop, this is a respectable, drinkable beer, which is what S.A. aims for, and always achieves. A six pack will have you feeling very toasty."
"An easy, diverting spring beer, nothing remarkable, just a sweet thing to slip down the throat and celebrate springtime."
"Impression/Drinkability: Works well enough as a refreshing summer seasonal, but uninspiring overall."
"I recommend it. It's not as bold as other offerings by Boston Beer Company, but it's worth it in season."
"It's okay, dog."
"Notes: It's bland. Think of the flavor of a Hoegaarden, cut it in half, and then add a light to moderate astringency."
"This Witbier is different in appearance than most that I have had. It is copper orange amber in color and cloudy, but sort of thick looking like all natural juice. Carbonation is present with some nice lacing. Aroma is very distinct with a definite reminder of orange Jell-O mixed with peach juice and lots of spice. The spices pull through strong with coriander being obvious and a bit of floralness and a citusy orange peel twang at the end, which is probably the wheat. Mouthfeel is a little heavy and a little to creamy for the style. I think this one would wear it's welcome quickly."
"Pours a hazy orangy ochre color with a short-lived eggshell colored head. Too dark to be considered ""white"" in my book. Orange peel mostly predominates the aroma with fleeting glimpses of pale malts, wheat and coriander. Crisp and sweet, with an almost cloying orange-laden fruitiness. Not really what I was expecting when ordering this. One of the worst Belgian-style witbiers I've ever had. Coors White is even better than this offering. Sorry Jim, if you want to brew an authentic Belgian-style witbier, you can't go overboard with similar/accentuating spicing. It should be renamed Samuel Adams Orange Ale."
"Pours a hazy amber orange with a good s finger head and nice lace. Really had to search for a smell on this one, but what I did detect was a subtle hop floralness with a bit of citrus mixed in. Flavors of a mild wheat malt with some lemon, orange followed but a nice hop flavor, more than what I thought. Leaves a grassyness in the afterteaste - possibe lemongrass in the brew? A better than average wit but nothing special - worth keeping a sixer of it around though."
"Pours hazy and light straw colored, with the large head I've come to expect from Sam Adams. Nose is full of fruity esters, sweet fruit, some malt, and some spice. Taste is subdued toasty malt with some interesting spice - coriander and orange peels mostly. Mouthfeel is lighter and thinner than I would have expected. Although not the best wit I've had, its not a bad choice for a barbeque in the summertime."
"Overall I'd will drink it again if given to me and nothing better is available."
"Yellow-orange color with a 1/4"" white head. Very minimal lacing on the glass. At first a very unusual smell.. malt and fresh mint? I'm sure it must be the hops, but it has some minty kind of quality. There is also a fresh orange smell there, a more likely and welcome smell for a witbier. It has a thin body but a big malty flavor with spices at the end. Ah, very nice taste. Pretty smooth drinking, but nothing jumps out at me.. except that odd minty note in the nose."
"Hardly a grand example of the style, but a quaffable brew that would make for good afternoon drinking."
"Pours a hazy orange tinted deep gold with a bright white lingering pillowy head. Aroma is a bit spicy and peppery with some lemon-orange notes coming through. Taste is where this one falters. There is a bit of coriander and citrus that is traditional with the style. However after that initial touch the beer falls flat. In fact it seems more like a Hefeweizen than does their Hefeweizen. Overall this was just kind of boring. Not offensive in anyway, but just blah. Mouthfeel was OK with a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability is low because well its just kinda dull and boring. I could drink a few of these, but I really dont want to. Sammy can be very hit or miss. The Black Lager was fantastic, but the White Ale just seems to go through the motions of being a Wit bier. Oh well at least I didnt plunk down a bunch of cash for it."
"A very decent beer, should be very refreshing ice cold on a warm spring/summer day."
"Not bad, but I'd pass next time."
"I miss the old Sam Adams Spring Ale. Well, not really, but it is better than this beer. I poured my first bottle and poured it out because there were lots of floaties. Thinking the glass was really dirty I poured it out and got a clean glass. Poured a second glass and still lots of floaties. The color was a sick orange, with a thin head that receded to the edges. The aroma is slightly sour, but with hops and citrus present. The flavor is sour. Tones of wheat are also there. Hops are there and iI get the impression they threw in some extra spices... cinnamon, some nutmeg. The mouthfeel is very metallic and the carbonation feels like it is burning. Somehow, this beer is not undrinkable, but I have no intentions of buying any more after this six-pack."
"This isn't one of their best beers. I've recently been reiminded that Sam Adams in general is a very good brewery, despite being fairly mainstream. I've been trying or re-trying their beers and some I'd definately drink on a regular basis. This one is lacking though. Appears a very cloudy gold orange color with a head that shinks pretty face. Smell is odd, maybe even a bit metallic, but there's a strong wheat smell there, and a weird chemical scent. Taste is much the same. For some reason this reminds me of beer from a can, with a taste of tin and some strange chemical quiality to it. The bready yeasty wheat is there but it's not interesting enough to get the off tastes out of my mind. If you're gonna get Sam Adams go for something else, this really isn't a good example of the style or a good example of what the brewery is capable of producing."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with tints of gold and a thin white head. The aroma is mildly malty with a definate sweet orange aroma with a faint spice in the background. The flavor is clean malty, not very bitter, with the orange flavor definately present and spices in the finish. I like that the new label has an educationall bit about mouthfeel on it and I felt the mouthfeel was good. Overall this is a safe well made example of the style, and like most commercially successful wits, leans to the sweet orange flavors over the spice flavors."
"Another impressive brew from the folks at Sam Adams. This poured a tad orange with nice head and carbonation. Really fizzes in the mouth and provides a nice sensation on the tongue. Typical witbier that has a grat taste. Would not be a great session beer though. Thumbs up."
"On tap at Old Chicago as part of Spring mini tour. Certainly not the best Belgian Wit available, but not the worst either. Cloudy with a nice sized head, and a spicy aroma. Taste has a lot of wheat flavor, with some spiciness coming through in small amounts. Not a bad gateway beer."
"This beer is probably more simple than this review might indicate. Overall it is refreshing and drinkable, sure enough. Don't bother with this if it is less than 60 degrees outside, or it may be totally lost."
"Cloudy orange pour with 1/2 inch white head. Citrusy odor but not overpowering. Taste was mild for a witbier, very crisp, cracker like flavors with a little zest flavor thrown in. Dry finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat light. Witbiers are not my favorites. I can only compare this to a Hoegarden, and the Sam is a lesser version of the style. Now, this is a non-intrusive easy beer to drink, but it would ultimately be a tad boring. Nice enough. I'll drink it when I get it in a mix pack."
"Nice drinkable spring time beer. Would definatlly have again."
"Cloudy orange pour with a pretty big head that fades quickly. Smell is citric and malty with some fruit rind scents as well. Taste is pretty average. There's a distinct yeasty maltiness, but it's not so great. Somewhat spicy, but not very strongly. The aftertaste is tart with some yeast. Overall, not a great beer, the sweetness doesn't complement the fruity tastes very well, and these particular yeasty flavors just don't do it for me. Not terrible, but not something that will make me want another."
"Drinkability: I don't think I'll be finishing this 6 pack anytime soon. I'm sure my mom won't mind drinking them, but I'll tell her to drink them icy cold."
"Not that I would remember what that is like living in Hawail for the past 11 years."
"In that Witbiers are my favorite, I am predispositioned to this genre. I enjoyed this mug very much."
"Easy to drink. Nothing there to put you off. Nice seasonal."
"Very creamy ½-inch of starting covering with some nice stick. Hazy yellow/gold hue; like dark straw, and no action at all. Coriander, flour, flower petals and some wheat on nose; rosehip too. Very sweet lemon and sasparilla on mouth with a fair amount of body and a pleasant wheat cloak that doesnt fall off the radar. Quality serving."
"I prefer heavy stouts and porters so this beer didn't impress. Color was cloudy orange. The head was poor with little retention. Spicy smell was a little stong. Like the smell the taste was a little on the spicy side. Not a bad beer just not what i look for in a beer. Again, not my favorite style so i wouldn't go out of my way to have again."
"overall definitely not a bad beer and worth a try, but not the best either."
"A much better beer than macro, but not up to the other recent Sam Releases such as the Dark Lager."
"Overall this was a good take on a Witbier, but nothig too impressive. The smell and taste could have been more prominent. I enjoyed the pint, but didn't come back for another."
"Really not a bad beer or interpretation of the style. Not one that I'd go out of my way to get, but if its on special or you're faced with the typical boring lineup at the bar, I'd go for this one. Poured a bright unfiltered orange. Slightly fizzy/orvercarbonated perhaps. Smell is a touch spicy. Taste is pretty much what I expected.... slightly yeasty, with some orange and spicing present. Pretty smooth, very drinkable beer. A step above your average American hefe or wit, but not up there at the top. This one weighs in somewhere in Blue Moon territory or a little better."
"Pours medium-dark cloudy orange with a nice creamy head, good retention and lacing. Wasn't a lot in the nose, slight yeasts and light alcohol notes. Tastes like an unfiltered Sam, I was expecting more straying from their standard flavors. Nonetheless, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Smooth like a Sam, just expected more."
"This witbier pours an opaque deep orange color. A big foamy head is produced as well as some slight lacing. The smell was malt and apricot. Taste was similar with a strong malt breadiness up front which yielded to apricot and essences of spices. There was a slight, very slight metallic character to this beer. The mouthfeel was a bit over carbonated, but overall it was pleasant on the tongue. This is a great beer. I'd surely buy more."
"Overall nothing spectacular as it's fairly similar to a lot of other Belgian style ales. I'd still recommend it if you're eating a big meal and want to save room for the food."
"Poured out a mad cloudy orangish hue with a nice bit of head. Smell of typical belgian brews i would guess to be esters.Taste is a bit sour no hops noticable just ok.Mouthfeel is mediocre at best. Not a big fan of this brew isnt terrible but isnt worth mentioning either."
"This beer has an interesting goldenrod sort of color, making it easy to tell its a wheat beer, as if the style didn't give it away. Being a wheat beer, and an unfiltered one, there is a bit of sediment whirling around as well, but thats not a bad thing. The head is decent, quite white with lots of lace. The aroma of this beer is quite delicious, unfortunately a bit better than that of the beer itself in my opinion, quite sweet with a taste of spices, unusual but in a good way, I think. It tastes very wheaty, with the spices quite evident, don't ask me to name them, my cooking skills are limited to ramen and mac & cheese, but its good... it finishes somewhat sweet and spicy, but with a mild hint of hops to balance it out. It's better than say, Blue Moon, but its not on par with an actual Belgian Wit. This beer has a bit of an unusual mouthfeel; fairly slick, kind of like some sort of petrochemical product.. it could be worse, though. All in all, I think this is a very drinkable beer, especially with pepper jack cheese, mmm... It certainly isn't a beer I have to struggle to finish."
"Overall: Not bad, but not great. It doesnt disappoint but fails to excite. Another one of Sam Adams so-so seasonal brews that I will always go for at Airport Bars in preference to the Big3, but given some serious Belgian Wit competition it would all by the wayside immediately."
"Light amber in coloration, sediment falls to the bottom, some remains in a colloidal solution. Cloudy. Head almost non-existent, but the lace manages to linger. The drinker can smell hops and malt. Tastes peppery, a hint of grapefruit, and I dare say a hint of mint--but very little malt in the taste. Citrus-hops flavor (chiefly grapefruit). Very little stimulation on the palate, minus the sweet front. In the mouth Sam's White Ale bubbles ferociously--to an unpleasant degree. BBC makes far better beers, from my own personal experience."
"Over all impression it doesn't smell much better than it tastes. Not a decent wit or an American Macro."
"Poured out to a cloudy orange amber color, with a touch of sediment finding it's way to the bottom of the glass. Strong odors of herbs and earth, with a slighly sweet character. Flavors of spices and citrus with a bit of bite on the finish. A fair offering from Sam Adams. Not a favorite, but a worthy brew."
"Drinkability- Not all that bad for a Sam Adams brew. Nice summer citrus taste to it. Not a Hoegaarden by any means, but not a bad brew."
"Quite good if one considers this as a generic wheat beer, but it lacks Belgian wit character."
"Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, and better than most domestic macro offerings out there, but why would the experienced beer drinker waste time with this when there's better representatives of the style out there? Use this to break your Bud Light swilling friends in gently to the world of different beer styles, but move on quickly."
"Cloudy, very pale amber-orange color with a lot of carbonation and a decent puffy head. This is a nice-looking brew. Generous wheat-like citrus in the aromalemon, orangetheres a little yeastiness and an appealing spiciness (pepper, clove). Taste is fairly light, with the wheat, lemon, and a bit of malt mixed together. Refreshing and drinkable. Its not as spicy as it could be, but is very enjoyable. Its an accessible beer as well. My brother, a dedicated macro-drinker, really enjoyed this one."
"Not a bad attempt at the style, but there is something generic about it. I will have this again, but I'm not impressed. Very drinkable and a solid offering from a brewery of this size."
"Drinkability. This is the type of beer that begs for a second. Smooth and flavorful without being too strong or overwelming. A definate session beer."
"This is a really good beer from boston beer. The taste and smell are unique. It has a deep, yet clean, fruity taste. I really cant compare it because i cant think of any beer remotely like it. I also taste some sweet spices. This is a real winner fellow beer drinkers. I don't think anyone could find disfavor with this as it is a very well balanced, flavorful and easy to drink beer."
"I go out in my town with my girlfriend and expect to drink garbage beer. Much to my enjoyment, at the local chain restaurant, they had just tapped a fresh keg of sam adams white ale. a great beer when expecting to have to setlle for a yuengling or a guiness."
"Samuel Adams White Ale is a refreshing, thirst quencher."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a tall white head that fades somewhat slowly and leaves a small bit of lacing on the glass. Lots of citrus in the aroma along with some spice from the yeast. The flavor is a little spicy with a citrus hint and a nice fruity character. Smooth to drink. Nice mouthfeel. This makes for a nice witbier and I'll probably have it again if given the chance."
"Pours a hazy, pulpy, peach with a soft whitish head. Smells of apricots, tangy yeast, metal, and coriander. Taste is crisp, tangy apricot wheat. A little lemon zest too. Turns wheat bitter with a yeasty finish. Lively, but also a little mouth coating feel. Not bad--better than Summer Ale--but still not what I would call a dead-on witbier."
"Samuel Adams White Ale is a different animal, that much is certain. I can't say that I prefer it to some of my favorite witbiers (Great Lakes Holy Moses, John's Generations White Ale, Avery White Rascal), but it has a smooth citrusiness and a combination of spices that I find appealing. I'll look for it again."
"Had on tap at Uno's. Unos is a great place for some great pizza and especially since they carry Sam Adams. Usually they have the Sam Adams ale, and then a seasonal. At the moment it is the white beer. If you are expecting a white or wit beer like I was, you will be disappointed. This is nothing like a hoegarden, blue moon, or a celis white. This seems like a robust pale ale. It's not bad, and beats the hell out of the macros on tap (Coors light and such). The flavors are subtle, nothing jumps out, the most noticeable is a mild hop finish. Again, a robust, solid pale ale, but not a white or wit."
"The beer appears an orangey white in my glass. The smell is of mild hops. The taste is, fortunately, the best part of this beer. It tasted to me sweet and fruity. The body is lighter than medium, and this beer seems go down very fast. To get the taste, I feel like I am taking bigger sips of the beer than I normally would. If the flavor of the beer were more rich, than I would be a much better experience."
" This is a very average Witber at best - not recommended."
"An all right beer, but not exceptional."
"Drinkability  Ill call this one a near miss. If they can get that flavor down this will be a good beer. That may sound stupid saying that, If it only tasted better it would be good, but the other qualities of the style are historically difficult to achieve, and here they are well along."
"Very smooth with an upfront fruit characteristic (tropical), that blends into a bitter yeasty finish. This goes down easy."
"When poured into a clear glass the color was golden with huses of orange, with a nice white foam head. The smell of hops was slighty evident and the aroma was of a weak Belgium Style Ale. The taste was also weak with not much on the aftertaste. It had a bitterness that was pleasant, but, also a sour feel on the palate, that was not of my liking. Nice on a hot day as a quincher!"
"The Samuel Adams White Ale pours a hazy orange color with sediment dropping falling in to the glass at end of pour (normal) the head is creamy and falls to a respectable froth. Smell is dull and uninviting, hints of hops and grains but nothing really there. The taste is what you would expect after the smell, rather dull with spice flavors with no pizazz in the hops. Feels rather light, drinkable for one but did not want to go back."
"Sampled 3/3/04"
"Hazy, pale yellow-gold in hue with pasty highlights. A lovely white head of more than two fingers in height topped off this Wit idyllically. The head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a foamy cap, which still had decent size throughout consumption. The subsequent lacing was spotty and sticky. It looks good in a glass. The first whiff of the nose told me that SA got the key components of the style; it was orangey with other notes of zippy citrus, coriander with a hint of yeasty-wheat-bread at the finish. The potency is modest but plenty loud enough to understand the invitation. It is a good Wit nose; it just lacks a little panache! The palate is quite juicy; I like the citrus notes upfront. In the middle a big gush of orange follows and wipes out any other flavors for a moment. In the finish I could taste the spices, they are a bit muddled and it is hard to place the individual seasoning (maybe cloves, coriander, nutmeg?). Only in the aftertaste is the malt tasted, wheaty, dull but round and tasty. If the malty taste could start early in the beer SA would have a real winner here. As is, Id say it is a bit better than Coors Blue Moon and even Boulevards ZON. It is an Americanized Wit for the masses. The sweetness grows, I cant see quaffing too many in one setting. Still I like it, as it is tasty and refreshing. The carbonation is on the bigger side, pleasant mouthfeel, medium-light in body; all in all it works for the style. Ive passed on this many times but when I seen a 12-pack on sale of $8 I caved in. SA White Ale is an average beer really."
"All in all, I like this offering from Sam Adams... not bad, not bad at all."
"A decent stab at the Belgian wit/white style. A darker than normal yellow colour with a nice white head of foam that lasts for the glass. The aromas are all coriander, orange peel, and classic witte spices, as well as a nice yeasty wheat presence. The taste is yeasty up front with a nice spiciness in the middle, and a bit of a ""too-sweet-for-me"" finish. The mouthfeel is light and that makes this brew very quaffable. Very reminiscent of Hoegaarden, but not quite as good. A good try though."
"7.7/10"
"Pours a hazy light golden amber. Smell hard to smell much light citrus, spice and grain very light in nose department. Taste better light citrus with some spiciness, no yeast taste to speak of though I poured some in? Clean refreshing light tasting brew but nothing here calling me to have another."
"The taste is light and malty, with one of the most refreshingly clean finishes I've had in recent memory. Perhaps one of the better San Adams seasonals I've tried, I'll look forward to more of this next year."
"Mmm good beer. Very light and fruity, at first I had to check that what I was given was actually beer. But nevertheless, I am still hunting this beer down to try again..."
"A pretty good warm weather beer, perfect for lounging out in the sun."
"Drinkability: One of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, but not one of the best. Bring this one back soon! When it was available, I drank it everyday."
"This beer is great! Pours almost white with little head. Very crisp taste with a clean finish. I could drink this beer all day long. This stuff was a special edition so I don't know when, if ever, they'll be brewing it again. You'll be hard pressed to find a better beer for lounging around the pool on a hot Summer's day."
"Sam Adams' seasonals continue to be their stronger beers in my opinion. None of them are below average and a couple are really good. This beer is a slightly hazy light orange color with a medium white head. Quick lacing. The aroma is lightly spiced with some citrus as well. Crisp body and very lively and easy to drink. Bittersweet spice flavors of pepper and clove, along with citrus and a pinch of vanilla. The finish is somewhat wheaty. While not on par with some of the better Wits out there, this is a perfectly nice seasonal."
"This beer pours a hazy golden peach color with a moderate off white head that held for a good amount. The smell is really spicy and yeasty with a grainy malty precense. The taste is really nice and refreshing. Citrus flavors are prevalent along with a breadyness to the base. Spices are particularly strong here and seem complex as well. Pepper, coriander, sweet orange peel, more that I can't recognize. Yeast is very prevalent and almost seems to provide a sweetness among the spices and bready flavors. The Sam Adams hoppiness comes through the further I go and provides a nice little addition to the beer. Still, this is a little unbalanced by being too sweet and it's not a classic example of a Belgian Wit. But it sure is refreshing. Nice offering."
"No thanks."
"Sam Adams White Ale is another solid offering from the Boston Beer Company. It pours out an orange-brown color with a fairly decent head. Smell is something of faint citrus and mild spice, but nothing overpowering. The taste is good, with definite hints of lemon and spice... typical hoppiness of a Sam Adams beer. Finishes with a notable yeast flavor. Mouthfeel is moderate to light... nothing to write home about, but not bad either. Slightly high on the carbonation, which definitely damages the drinkability some. A very tasty beer that I'd gladly drink again and again."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a tall bright white head that dissipates into a foamy lace. Nose is grassy with notes of grains and yeast. Moderate in body with a slightly slick texture. Taste begins with some sweet malts and lemony fruitiness followed by a blend of spices (coriander, clove, nutmeg, and a touch of cinnamon). This is followed by a bit of nutty yeasts and tart citrus notes as well as a bite of white pepper. A decent beer for a hot day but fairly boring overall."
"Drinkability- The carbonation and the oily taste in the mouth would keep me from drinking this in mass quantities. That being said, this isn't a beer intended to be a session beer. The modest spicey flavor, coupled with the lemon twang are money, and make this beer a quality brew."
"Overall, I would recommend it highly to those unfamiliar with the style, as it may open you up to something new. To wit veterans, expect a slightly more American approach to the style, with an emphasis on easy drinking. Quite impressive for a mass-market brew."
"Had this on-tap at the local BW-3's. It poured a nice orange color with a rather large foamy white head. Smell was mild but there were notes of wheat and spice. Taste was interesting, i believe i actually tasted some pine in this one. Very different but pleasant. I prefer this over hoegaarden anyday."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before JUN on label."
"Dirty peach with fluffy large white sticky top. A zesty combo of hops and spices - maybe Grains of paradise, coriander, and something very flowery. Flavor is fluffy and delicate, a bit sugary but finishes dry. Feels light and refreshing but still a good amount of flavor. Very nice, I could drink a few of these and continually enjoy it."
"This beer came to me highly recommended from the liquor store where I usually buy my beer. The person I talked to loves Belgian wheat beers and said that this was one I definitely had to try. I came expecting a bit more than I actually got but this is a good brew. Poured a golden-orangish color with a decent head. The smell was a bit citric and that was indicative of how it would taste. The taste had definite citric notes but nothing to write home about. Its a beer that you can have a few of and get tired of but at the same time, Sam Adams has better beers out there. I like Sam Adams Weiss a bit more. Also, as a side note, I have also had this beer on tap and it seems a bit more flavorful out of tap. The thing about this beer is that it is good but doesn't grab you, the taste is rather subtle."
"This brew is a hazy gold/orange colored brew, with a sizable cream-colored foam head on top. Some sweet malts on the nose, hints of floral tones as well. The taste is cereal grains for the main course, slight hop balance. Medium bodied. Theres nothing earth shattering about this beer, it is what it is sposed to be, a light refreshing drink."
"Cloudy, orangey amber color with a decent white head that lasted quite a while and left a bit of lace. Smell was mild, wheat beer with a little citrus. Taste was malty wheat with lemon-orange citrus notes, and interesting spice mixture including coriander (but also other spices I couldn't specifically identify), leading up to a woodsy hop flavor with nice hop bitterness. Very clean finish. Smooth medium mouthfeel with lively carbonation. Very drinkable. I was surprised by this beer... I like wit beers OK, but I actually think I like this better than most. I thought the taste was something a little different and it was very well balanced. I'll probably pick up some more before spring is over!"
"As far as Whites go this one is pretty low on my list. Nothing particularly wrong with it, but it sure isn't going to wow you. Cloudy amber in color with a moderate amount of rapidly fading white head. Aroma is weak and uninteresting. The malty flavor has a slightly spicy note with a hint of lemon. Drinkable, but neither an engaging nor ""out for a buzz"" type of beer."
"Simply put, this stuff smells better than it tastes. A dumbed-down cross between a decent wit and an American Macro. If I wanted a really cheap, ahem, ""Wit", I'd go with Blue Moon instead. A decent introductory to the style, but I'd much rather have an Allagash, Blanche de Chambly, Holy Moses or Vuuve."
"One-and-a-half fingers of tight, white foam. Slightly hazy orange-gold beer. Tons of carbonation. An odd, sour nose. Citrus, bread and flowers in the front. Some spice and pepper. Some fruit and malt in the middle. A touch oily. Nice, fresh, flowery, bitter finish. A little sour, but good. Flowery, tea-like aftertaste. Somewhat nutty. This isn't bad. It's fresh, floral, hoppy."
"pours a hazy light brown with slight orange tint and a thick bubbly head. Has a malty citrus orange aroma that is enticing. My first impressions was it started light and refreshing with a lemony citrus flavor and finished a bit fuller on the back of the palate with a bit of sour that ended in a bit of breadiness. The more I drank this, the less I liked it. It became more of a bland sour-like bitter with each taste. I didn't finish the moderately pricey 22 oz'er."
"Allagash anyone?"
"Poured a nice amber with nice head and decent lacing.Smelled of wheat, spice and orange and tasted very much the same. Mouthfeel was pleasant, but didn't help to add character to this brew, which it was very much lacking. One 20 oz glass of this was plenty. I was really disappointed with this one because I had heard good things about it before trying it."
"Poured a surprisingly dark amber for a witbier. Aroma was up-front with coriander and orange. Same for the flavor profile - a bit heavy-handed with the spices, and not much yeast flavors to balance. A little bit thinner and acidic than most of the style. Sweet and simple-minded, this strikes me as Sammy's entry into the Coor's Blue Moon category, going for the only mildly adventurous beer drinkers."
"I had this with some friends the other evening while out to dinner. It came in a large pilsner glass, 27 oz. The beer was a cloudy golden-yellow. Atop was a 1/2"" head of light white fluff. The nose was immeadiately detectable as citrus, lemon, orange. The first taste was suprisingly sweet. Ugg, it almost tasted artificially sweetened. Average motuhfeel, it seemed to be a little too heavy for white ale, but maybe more aking to big hefe. Spice flavors were stock clove and corriander, maybe cinammon or nutmeg too. This beer really got worse as I continued drinking it. It had a very ppor aftertaste about halfway through. I really was very let down by this. I don't think I'll ever have another, mayeb out of a bottle for comparison's sake. So many better wits and hefes."
"Nice cloudy appearance with a decent head and very nice lacing. Aroma was heavy on the wheaty side, but not unpleasant. Taste was very nice with a slightly bitter, lemony quality. Mouthfeel was decent and drinkability was not bad. I feel this would be a good offering for the summer season. Overall, a decent brew."
"The beer as it disengages the 12 ounce brown bottle a slightly hazy amber color; the head is a frothy bright white cap to crown the body with the lace a satiny sheet to obscure the glass. Sweet malt dominates the nose, fresh crisp and clean as a beer can be, start is sweet, pleasant malt profile, with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is persnickety in its acidity, the hops pleasing to the palate. Aftertaste is desert bone dry and a fine drinking beer that satisfies my B spot."
"pours with a nice cloudy amber colour and a decent sized, white head. much better apperance than expected. the smell is of wheat, spice, citrus and hop. this one is quite dry throughout. flavour starts with a bit of spice then a lemon hop flavour followed by a sweet grain finish. this one was pretty basic but pretty smooth and tasty overall. i was quite surprised as the last time i had this one was probably 4-5 years ago and it used to be much sweeter, in a bad way. the balace of flavour here is nice and this essentially now seems like a combo of the spring ale and the summer ale that the bbc offers. not bad."
"Taste is a bit biting up front. Fizzy and crisp. Some bitterness from orange peel(?). Very light hints of coriander and clove. Light fruity citrus flavors intertwined with lightly sweet wheat malt. Medium bodied with a lightly sweet aftertaste. A bit too fizzy. A decent attempt at a Belgian wit but I like my wit a bit smoother. Not bad but falls a bit short."
"Poored nice and hazy with a nice white head. Went down relatively quickly to a nice lace. The taste is solid, but nothing astounding. I haven't had too too many for the style, so keep that in mind. It had citrus overtones but nothing overwhelming. The taste is light, as it should be. Unfortunately, the beer seemed a tad too heavy, reducing its overall drinkability."
"A nice light summer time beer. Will be good on hot days, but better wits are available."
"Grabbed this one while on a regular shopping trip, not a planned beer expedition so I wasn't expecting too much. Poured a nice hazy pale yellow with orange tint and a fluffy while head that settled quickly and left little lacing. The smell was of bread, bananna, a little clove. The taste was pretty light but very pleasant. Probably not a ""superb"" rendition of the style, but I really enjoyed this one. It had just enough tang and zest along with the breadiness and bananna-clove spiciness to make a warming Saturday afternoon very enjoyable. This was also extremely drinkable. I'm new to the style and have not tasted the quintessential WIT's and HEFE's yet, but this hit the spot and I will be buying this again throughout the summer months. Good to enjoy a Sam Adams brew again, it's been a while."
"A great tasting beer. I was supprised how much I enjoyed it. Flavor is just great and mouthfeel is fantastic."
"Much more on-point than their odd ""summer ale""; in my opinion this should carry right through until it's replaced by the colder-month offerings."
"It is OK drinkable; the Winter Lager is better."
"Crisp bubbly action makes this suitable for warmer climes. Very smooth flowing across the palate. These bottles disappear very easily from my stock. I was initially disappointed that this was only available in 12-pack form at Krogers, seeings as how I'm on a beer-buying moratorium of sorts. Hmmph - glad I broke it. Very pleasant beer from start to finish."
"Note: put simply, a ""hopped/spiced Hefe"""
"Had this at the Venus lounge in Mankato. Poured it out in the glass, and it was a hazy yellow color. Lemon and malt scents. Flavor is spicy then bitter, clean aftertaste. Served with a lemon, i don't know if that was a good idea. Still not a bad beer, of an under-made style (in my opinion)."
"This is a fine beer and I, for one, am glad to see this become the ""new"" version of the spring seasonal. This could stay and be the summer seasonal too..."
"The hop is stronger than I'd expect in the taste, but the beer has a nice wheat/malt flavor. Strong citrus flavors. The beer's body features a low carbonation that brings out a certain degree of chaulkiness. Thick and malty. Overall, a predictable but tasty wheat ale."
"Sweet. Wow, so sweet. It is the first and last impression that this beer leaves. My wife would like it, but I don't think I could drink another without some insulin. It had no smell of note, and poured a nice cloudy light caramel color. Had a very nice white head, which lingered at 1/8"" for the entire glass with good lacing. Nicely carbonated, but SWEET. I followed this with a blue moon belgian white, which is a vastly superior beer of this style."
"This is a little strange for me, and that's saying a lot. It had a very citrusy taste, with some other off tastes. I'm not too sure what the off tastes were, but it was funky. Sure, it wasn't a bad beer or anything, just a little sloppy, I think. I do think that it would go better with a slice of orange though. At the same time though, I like beers that are good w/o added things."
"Not very complicated but it fits the style."
"Good-sized white head on a slightly cloudy orangy-gold hued brew. Citrus aroma, and a wheaty, citrusy taste, both parts of which are in seemingly equal proportions, making a nicely balanced flavor. An enjoyable product from Boston Beer."
"Pours out hazy orange with a nice white head. Smells of spices and bread. Tastes wonderful, nice and refreshingly sweet, very spicy as well, kinda like an o'fest with some ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg thrown in. Nice crisp finish with an overall light body. A wonderful spring beer which i would really enjoy on a march or april afternoon."
"Poured a very hazy orange color, with a medium white head - looks beautiful so far. Aroma is a citrusy, spiced, and yeasty. Carbonation is light but still present. The flavor is really impressive - spicy all 'round with a pleasant citrus bite and a soft buttery yeast flavor. The aftertaste is full of the same spice. Very crisp and refreshing, this is a great new seasonal for Sam Adam's and I am looking forward to drinking it in warmer weather."
"Huge head greats me very nicely and abundantly! It's frothy and has some staying power. The beer itself is a heavily clouded burnt orange. A nicely citrus filled aroma is a treat, mostly lemon and orange peel. Zingy carbonation makes it very drinkable. The flavors are similar to the aroma, lemony and orangey peel character. It's very refreshing and reminds me of summer instead of spring. I can't complain about that though. This should make this a summer ale so it can dominate over Blue Moon."
"$10.99 for a 12 pack."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a cloudy gold to orange with a finger of head and some lace. There is an orangey aroma with clove and a tinge of floral hops that reemerge in the finish. The malts and spices are fairly well balanced leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Citric tartness and clove."
"When poured, the White Ale has a orange-yellowish color and is very cloudy. The smell is extremely strong with lemon and orange scents very present. When tasted, the lemon dominates. I found this beer to be very similar to the Sam Adams Summer Ale, but a bit heavier. Leaves a sweet, slightly bitter aftertaste. A decent beer that would be much more enjoyable during the summer as opposed to the winter."
"Highly drinkable. Would love to have it all summer."
"I would have these if its whats being offered and in the summer after cutting the lawn. If the lemon was not so overbearing it would be excellent. I'll try it again when the weather is warm."
"All in all, not a way to start a newbie onto wit beers. Not interesting enough to drink often"
"Lots of spicy smells, coriander and others, but seemed a bit contrived. Taste was orangish, with hints of other spices, cinnamon traces here and there. Medium shot ot metallic tastes. Some coriander and other tastes, but the flavors seemed a bit forced or artificial. I think the metallic taste, might be the artificial part to it. Medium bodied, still refreshing and tasty, but something a bit odd about it. Not nearly as balanced and powerfully refreshing as an Allagash White."
"Deep golden and cloudy appearance. Thin white head. Aroma is delicate, but nice. The sweet orange curacao is evident with some lemony notes as well. The taste is thin though. It's lemony and refreshing to an extent, and there is even a lemon like tartness present, but overall, this doesn't hold a candle to the good wits out there. The carbonation is light and the body is about medium."
"This review hails from the West coast so we don't get the full range that the Boston Beer Co. has to offer. So you might be able to imagine how excited I was to find a beer produced by this brewery that I had only read about. Here is my review which was sidelined by my subjective enthusiam, so I beseech the reader to add an impartial objectivity. Boldly stated, this was something of a disappointment. The appearence is an orange, cloudy substance that retains quite a bit of a pleasant foam that is balanced by a mediocre bouquet that can be compared to sniffing a Chimay Grande Reserve through a coffee filter. Its taste is nothing to gawk at but it is noticable that its true potnetial has been undercut by commercial imperatives. The slightly creamy mouthfeel is rounded- out nicely by the sharp interruption of its dryness. Overall this is an enjoyable specimen that either suit the likes of the Belgian White Ale amatuer or that of the aficionado that never cared much for the style whatsoever. All in all not an offensive experience, nor one for the books."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a substantial thick sticky head. A nice looking Wit beer. Smell is faint but spicy of the expected orange peel, citrus, and pepper. Taste is refreshing and light bodied with a hop oil back, orange peel, lemon, touch of coriander and black pepper. Would like the spices to be more robust. This is no Allagash White, but better than a Blue Moon. I also like this offering much better than the Sam Adams Summer. Definitely worth having again."
"Emerges from the bottle with a stealthy white head settling over predictably hazy/cloudy gold liquid. Off-putting metallic aroma in the nose, with witbier spice behind that. The taste is lightly tart, prickly carbonated mouthfeel, then light spiciness and bitter hoppiness. Finishes on the dry side. Nicely made, but they should tone down the hoppiness here so it would be more true to the style and maybe kick up the spiciness."
"Anyway I digress, the brew was a deep cloudy orange color with a nice white head that stuck around for a while and had very nice lacing. The aroma had a lot of little things, little hop, citrus (mostly lemon maybe orange?), and spice. The taste was pretty good, had a wheat flavor with lemon, orange and grapefruit (?) and finished with a little spice. Over all I felt that the beer was pretty good, more of a warmer weather brew that one that I would normally have on these cold North East nights. Feel that it lacks in some areas but not a bad brew at all."
"Good beer...not great but it's ok. I had it from the Variety Pack of last summer. An ok beer but nothing to brag about. Easy to go down. Not one of the best offerings from SA. Very light color...but if you have the Summer Ale why have this one...just my opinion. One or two is enough for me."
"Overall, a refreshing alternative to the typical macro stuff."
"Pours a hazy yellow colour with a moderate head. The smell was fruity, peppery, and slightly hoppy. The taste was also fruity. Lemons gave it a sharp sour kick followed by a peppery bite and then it was finished with a hoppy bitterness. The fruity taste was too much for me, and the carbonation was too much. other than that, not bad."
"Cloudy, peach orange hue, thin carbonated head. On the nose, some lemon and yeasty notes, typical of the style. Up front, a crisp, rather sharp feel. Some lemon peel and coriander noted, backed by a wheat based body. Maintains some spicy notes, a tinge on the peppery side, bordering on being medium bodied. Some late hop detection backed up with some bready flavorings. Tarty and a bit sour palate, finishes the same as it starts. A fine change of pace from the S.A. family of brews, refreshing and tasty, quite nice!"
"Sam Adams White Ale: This is their new Spring Seasonal, and man do I like this beer. A Belgian style Wit, pours a cloudy golden, with a huge, rocky pure white head. The aroma is very lemony, nice and sweet. Leaves thick lacing down the side. The taste is light, lemony and very refreshing. This really is a terrific tasting beer. Nice bready malts and a rolling taste of hops lie nicely on top of a sweet citrus flavor base. Cripes this beer is tasty. Very nice and a huge step up from last years Spring Ale, which I liked. Seems like Jimbo is getting back to brewing."
"pours cloudy and orangy light brown. w/ a large head that dimishes to a rocky foam, leaving lace. Flavor does have some spiceness, cloves and pepper, etc. But flavors seem abit subdued compared to the classics of the style. seems it needs a bit of a more belgian style yeast flavor to push the envelope. This would be a good one to try on non-beer lover friends...a belgian with training wheels..."
"The beer pours a very cloudy gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good although it seems a bit malty for a wheat beer. There is a nice mix of wheat and pale malt scents here. The taste is above average. It is a little watery and not very wheat tasting. There seems to be a bit of spice here, but not much. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. The beer drinks well, but just like all their seasonal or replica beers, it falls short of the original. These guys could be the best in America, but they always sell out to try and please the masses instead of the BA. All in all, not bad."
"A solid, though not spectacular offering from Sam Adams. It pours a light oragneish, cloudy color with a respectable amount of laceing. The taste is certainly consistent with what you would expect from a Belgian White, but it does seem ""watered"" down to satisfy the general american public. All in all a good beer, and perhaps one of the better american take offs, but if you have a few extra bucks to spend there are certainly better."
"This was the first time I had ever seen this in the Deli where I get my beer so I picked it up,pours a deep hazy orane wich is odd for a white with medium head that left pretty quickly.The aroma was of malted wheat more than anything with some lighter spicey notes.Now the taste was decent but seemed a little heavy for the style mainly some spicines with a malted wheaty flavor in the finish,not a typical white to sit back drink a few on a hot day, but not all that horrible either."
"Appearance: Amber golden tone with a nice fluffy texture off white cream hued head, even ring of lacing very full collar sticking to the edge of the glass. Aroma: Spicy, bready, some metallic edge, citrus zest not bad just a bit tame and bland for a wit, authentic Belgian yeast strain here definitely got Samified. Taste: Zesty citrus tone with some spicy yeast and clove notes not bad, a peppery bite to it the finish is a bit harsh no where near as smooth as most wits. Mouthfeel: Medium in body nothing special can be compared to the Sam Adams Summer Ale. Drinkability: Not a fan just so many other better tasting more refreshing witbiers in the world why go for a knockoff like this one."
"I certainly wouldn't turn one of these down, but this beer doesn't register much on the excitement scale. It wasn't very yeasty, as the cloudiness was barely there, and the yeast sediment was close to nothing. A good summer drink, and I'd probably choose it over the Summer Ale."
"Part of a variety pack...sub hazy but quite dark brown/orange color, head is white and small bubbled but of only average duration. Laces well, though, nice webs. Aroma has some light yeast components, faint lemon, and non-descript spice that strains towards the coriander implied. Flavor is adequate as well as the medium fine carbonation, but leans toward lemon and black pepper in a somewhat unsettling way. Slighlty watery with a Brazil nut impression late, weakening the finish and the zen of the swallow. Not a favorite in a style that can be make or break in my book."
"This would be an okay beer to choke down one of if you are into unique beers, but rarely have I found a beer that I disagreed with so much that I had regret opening it. I will never purchase this beer again."
"This white poured a milky orange yielding an unremarkable head and nose. Average orange aroma with minor spices and malt lingering. Mouthfeel was passive but flavorful, with a citrusy-tart finish. Unremakable, and not impressive. It seems to fall into the lower ranks as most other SA's brews do, with exception to some seasonal ales. I wished I had a better opinion of SA brews, but I just can't form one!"
"Tasted: 05/30/03 & 05/29/04"
"pours a fairly dark tan for a wit...nice lasting head that left it's fair share of lacing. not much in the way of aroma to speak of. fairly carbonated. quick zap wheat followed by a lemony sourness. somewhat refreshing, though leaves an odd aftertaste. there are many better examples of the style that i would take before this one."
"AIBA 2003: Not too bad, decent amount of flavour, clove, spice, some citrus and banana. Fairly well balanced but uncomplicated. But once again with sam adams products (except for maybe the Millenium), they fail to completeely captivate me. But at least they didn't go to the completet arse end of the scale, its half deecent."
"A nice crisp refreshing brew that is a good session beer, but the flavor annoys me a bit. It has a lot of orange at the start, and it then turns grainy. It is not a bad brew, but I get a bit bored of the flavor after one or two. Other than that, it is a good summer brew."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Pour revelaed an extremely thick and long lasting creamy white head.As it reduced it left rings of lace in the glass.The color presented was orange and somewhat cloudy.Mouthfeel wasnt very crisp and seemed a bit watery.The finish left a sharp sweet or tart twist that dissapeared real quick.A bit bitter in the back of the throat with a wheaty grain taste.A spicy aroma thats not too strong but is there.Tastes of oranges,lemon,cloves,corriander,and honey are noted.Overall good with a medium body."
