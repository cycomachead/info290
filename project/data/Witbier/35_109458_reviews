"This is a good beer."
""
""
"Poured into a Blanche de Namur small pint glass.  Pours a golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of wheat, coriander, light orange citrus. Flavor of light wheat with strong coriander, mild citrus a hint of butteriness. Nice medium body with light creaminess and active carbonation. A mild witbier that is not quite able to support the level of coriander spicing. The light flavors of wheat and citrus are nice, but a bit underwhelming. A hint of the diacetyl that seems common in Boston Beer offerings, but at a level that add a pleasant mellowing component to this as is usually the case. I'd probably go for a more traditional witbier in the future, but this was easy and light and worked well for a warm afternoon."
""
""
"I like Sam Adams but this is probably one of their more boring beers.  Very mild with a hint of a spicy finish."
""
""
""
"A nice beer for someone starting to lean away from Buds and Millers"
""
""
"Very similar to Shock Top IMO. Blue Moon is better than this."
""
"One of the best from Sam Adams"
"Great early spring beer.  One of my favorites for drinking after getting my lawn ready for spring"
""
""
""
"This beer is Good. Worth a try"
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"I love Sam Adams, but this is marketed toward Blue Mooners. Alpine Spring needs to make a return."
""
"Looks hazy awe unless with a thin, creamy head.  Smells of spice and vanilla...cinnamon?  Taste...oh no, not too bad!  Actually pretty good.  Tastes of a lager with a warmer vanilla finish.  I like!  I could drink many of these.  Very smooth."
""
""
""
"Overall : Acceptable freshness and interesting craft. Very flavorful, but unbalanced, having overwhelming citrus. Could easily be called an orange beer, making this a bit hard to drink while eating for a white beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a very very average, maybe even below average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I don't really get it but I hear this beer sells really well.  For me, it was just another average wheat beer not worth seeking out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"An ok attempt, but now wow factor and not one to seek out.  Its what you would expect from Sam Adams...an above average brew that just can not compete with the quality of the micro brewers it likely inspired."
""
""
"From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, goes in hazy yellow with an unfiltered look.  No visible sediment.  One finger pale white head quickly fades to a thin cap with virtually no lacing.  On the nose, strong malt and spices evident.  In the mouth malty backbone balanced against moderate hops; hints of lemon.  Mouth is a bit fizzy but quenching and decent overall.  Really this tastes like a spiced Sam Adams Boston Lager to me.  Nothing remarkable."
"It wasn't horrible, but I'll still say ""Nothing to see here""."
"On tap,,rather bland and boring"
"Seasonal option at Red Lobster. To put it kindly, I should have ordered the cola."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On draft. Not sure if it was a bad batch but this was a huge diacetyl bomb. A huge amount of butter in both the aroma and flavor. Couldn't take more than one sip."
""
""
"O- After a few years of only having Boston Lager, Winter Lager, and Latitude 48 available, two additional Sam Adams beers became available in New Brunswick: Cold Snap and Rebel IPA. So far, I've only had this one (Cold Snap) and I have to stay that I'm fairly happy it's now available in my area. It offers a refreshing taste that has a good spiciness to it (although maybe too much coriander), and if oyu're looking for a good Witbier, this is much better than Hoegaarden."
""
"Ok, but not my type of brew"
"I am not a fan.  The combination of flavors do not go down well.  The spices are the downfall here.  Over done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good  beer try the winter lager not for me"
""
""
"Medium light bodied, crisp, was refreshing atleast."
""
""
"Not a big Sam Adams fan usually, but I like this beer. Has a great look, with good head that unfortunately doesn't last long enough. Flavors are nice and balanced. Smell is sweet. Been a cold winter in jersey. This beer feels and taste like the spring I'm longing for. I recommend it for sure."

"Overall: Good go to beer, tasty and finished off bar food very well. This brew will remind you a bit of the Sam Adams Summer Ale, might be a tweaked version of it, just this one is less sweet. Salud."
""
"Love this beer! Nice taste for a cold time of year"
"Not a fan of this one"
"A ""winter"" beer with a nice hint of ""summer"" in it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale orange with a slightly citrus aroma, but I might be reaching.  Figured I would at least get some coriander somewhere in this one, but no go.  Goes down easily though, if that's saying anything."
""
""
""
""
""
"This taste like an upgrade to Blue Moon. Nothing snappy about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I never thought the words ""Blue Moon tastes better"" would ever come out of my mouth."
""
""
""
""
"Cold Snap is a decent attempt at a witbier. Although this beer reminds me of the warmer weather to come (and that most certainly is a good thing), I think I might enjoy it more when the temperature stays above freezing."
""
"Gets way too sweet at the end. Perfect first couple drinks. Bummer."
"Sweet. overly carbed.  No real depth of flavor, no hoppyness. Not my favorite wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd stick with the Boston Lager before I picked this one out again. There are plenty of Witbiers and plenty of winter ales to try, this is just another notch on the belt."
"Hazed out golden peach hue, haze from the sediment poured into the glass. Decent head. Some faint spicing, perfume-like, honey malt, & yeast in the nose. Good crispness, odd sweetness ... perhaps from the malt and spicing, almost soapy. Not digging this latest creation so much."
""
""
""
""
"Not a big fan. It's not a nasty beer just wierd and slimmy."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy apricot orange. Lemony aroma with a sweet malt. Taste is sugary with a bit of orange and lemon hints. Finishes dry and sweet with minimal hop bitterness."
""
""
"Pretty bland taste that is mostly just a watered down orange / citrus flavor."
"Excellent beer! Very good taste."
"**(a) I am not paid by any manufacturer or distributor for any reviews. All such reviews are solely of my own opinion"

"Glorified blue moon, Sam Adams can do better."
"Very crisp white ale! Love this beer!"

""

""

"This beer tasted like Sam Adams was trying to do their version of Blue Moon but just with a bit more spices. I guess I was looking for more of a crisp orange taste without the risk of it being a Shandy. I would drink this again if it was offered to me."
"Better than I expected. I would order this again."
"Nice white ale with a smooth mouth feel.  A pleasant surprise as I am not usually a Sam Adams fan.  Recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hints of vanilla and citrus. I enjoyed the taste although the aroma was a tad overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
"Lacking flavour, and too sweet for the style. Not bad, but barely good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gold/orange pour with thick white head and very effervescent; floral and spice notes; weak orange juice flavor;crisp,clean mouthfeel with dry finish; overall, I found this odd tasting with the spice contradicting the citrus flavors rather than complimenting..."
""
""
"Fine. Nothing positive to say but nothing really negative either. Like a Blue Moon ripoff"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"murky orange color foamy head some streaky lace.  Nose is wit...soft orange peel, lemon zest. flavor is crisp and as rhe nose suggested soft orange peel. the bidy however is fairly full and a bit chewy. decemt wit but not all that memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some scent of citrus and spice.  Scent doesn't carry over much to the flavor; tastes like a regular wheat beer.  OK except for a little soapy taste on the finish.  Meh overall."
""
"Murky...not in a typical wheat way, but swamp water. Unfortunately, swamp watervwould be thicker in mouthfeel. Very thin. It also has a very funky fake flavoring. Not at all something I'll get again."
"Very much a Belgian wheat, it is reminiscent of a cross between Goose Island's 312 Urban and Blue Moon, with less citrus and more mouth feel."
"Nose of light orange peel, yeast, spice, citrus, malt. Taste light orange, citrus, crackers, bready malts, hint spice, yeasty."
"C+"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good representation of the style.   Definitely better Witbiers out there, but this is a very nice drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
"O: the artificial character of the citrus was off putting;"
""
""
"Poured from bottle in pint glass. Golden haze appearance, with two fingers of active, soapy head that dissolves at a steady pace. A white solid cap is left behind, with some spotty lacing. The aroma is of lemon and biscuit. Taste of funky citrus, some malt, some spice. Almost a peppery shandy. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, no alcohol burn, slippery. Average  witbeir, would be good outside on a hot summer day while grilling."
""
""
""
"Not a big fan of this one. It's just got an odd, over-spiced taste to it. Leaves a weird taste on the finish. Took two sips and handed it back, I'm all set for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Terrible. It's just a watered down lemonade."
"I hate almost all winter brews but this; this is great. It's almost like a Belgian with coriander only with some caramel, pepper, and cinnamon so it's not to dark but not light either."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this “seasonal” from Sam Adams.  It should probably be around all year."
""
""
""
""
"O- not bad but not good....slightly below average but much better than blue moon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour flat no head cloudy. Don't do it to yourself."
"This is very similar to a Blue Moon except I found it to be less sweet with more of a metallic taste. An easy drink that makes me long for the spring."
"Good witbier. Not the best, but definitely a one of the better attempts by a large brewery."
""
""
"Not a bad beer. Very light and easy to drink. Drank out of the bottle at a work function due to nothing else and wasn't overly impressed."
""
"For a big brewery, this one is really solid"
""
"Easy-drinking beer very typical of the style. Refreshing and easily sessionable. Nothing exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good spring beer"
""
""
""
"This beer is fuckin weird -- and not in a good way."
""
""
"Overall: I really liked this beer. The spices blend well and a nice touch of orange. I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A cloudy beer on tap, reminding me of a less sweet Blue Moon. Just OK in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Restoring my interest in witbiers. The creamy but crisp feel surprised me."
""
""
"If you like Hefeweizens and White Ales, you will like this seasonal beer.  Much better than Sam Adams' other Spring seasonal attempts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink, clean and crisp."
""
"Eh. Sweaty Gatorade comes to mind"
"Overall : the easy drinking nature of this beer makes it worth a purchase again. It is not the most flavorful beer, but you can drink it like a Budweiser and its leagues better. Nicely done, and unique."
""
""
"Overall: An acceptable Witbier, slightly above average, but not stellar.  I would order it again if I have no other good draught options."
""
""
""
""
"Gold cloudy look, light beer taste, not impressed"
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap at a nearby bowling alley. Nice Witbier.. Does not feel like it is your typical wide release beer. Looks like your average witbier with some nice lacing throughout. Smells ok, no distinction, your typical citrus for style. I like the taste. It's not too citrusy at all, which I like. I may not seek it out, but will be a go to at this particular spot moving forward."
"M: A bit full bodied for a wheat. Well carbonated."
"Poured in to a pint glass, a marshmallow-like crown of finely carbonated foam graces the hazy, honey-golden ale before briskly receding to a one finger head. Thin lacing remains as the only sign of that remarkable white cap. Excellent retention. The aroma promises sweet citrus orange, and ripe purple plum. The first sip brings a bready sweet malt backbone with a balanced orange peel zest. The moderate spicing accentuates the citrus notes and gives it a peppery punch. There's a nice grassy wheat flavor that permeates the whole experience. Fairly clean finish, as the balance of flavors restrain any one of the elements from becoming too dominant. The mouthfeel is a tad watery, with tame carbonation, making it extremely easy to gulp. Refreshing and satisfying. A touch basic, but delicious nonetheless. For a mass-marketed seasonal American witbier it stands above it's contemporaries. It lacks the near-cloying sweetness of Blue Moon and the off aftertaste. It steers clear of the adjunct flavors that creep in to Shocktop, and has more nuance than the fruity pebbles flavors of Sunset Wheat. I enjoy all of the aforementioned beers to one degree or another, but Cold Snap is definitely a step above in my mind. It's no Allagash White, but it's pretty damn tasty."
"Pours with little head and shows cloudy pale Amber in the glass.  Nose has some very light spice notes.  Lightly carbonated, and tastes a bit thin but with light orange and spice flavor, like a slightly watered down creamcicle with a bit of a yeast kicker.  Wouldn't drink a bunch of these, but refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent white ale and worth getting at least once. It most certainly isn't Allagash but it does offer an interesting variation."
""
""
""
""
"I didn't hate it, but I wasn't crazy about it either. I guess I'm not much of a hefe fan. It was a little too fruity. Kinda reminded me of watered down Mt Dew with some orange juice mixed in?"
"Wheaty, lemony, orangey, and uninspired."
""
""
""
""
"Eric"
""
""
"Very crisp with a small late bitterness."
" Overall I would recommend it to a friend."
""
""
""

"O: Not a bad take on a witbier, if a bit less complex than I'd prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! Great taste and body"
""
""
""
"Love the citrus and non filtered look"
""
"Fine example of a Wit."
"Citrusy grapefruit taste. Not my favorite winter beer but will do in a pinch. Got from draft."
""
""
"I normally like Sam Adams stuff pretty well, but I don't care for this one. Just blah all the way around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer looked beautiful and I was excited to try it after a recommendation from a friend.  After every sip, I kept tasting an overpowered spice reminding me of the flavor of root beer.  Really did not enjoy this one."
"Cloudy yolk, fine pillowy foam. Strong bread, grains of paradise, burnt orange. Light citrus front with a Bready finish. Not bad"
"Another one of my favs, snap, wish it was available all winter in restaurants."
""
"Nice smooth feel. No distinctive spice taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"S/definitely wheat beer with a strong citrus scent, mostly orange (Coriander?).  I also picked some spices but couldn't put a finger on any dominant one.  T/surprisingly good.  Wasn't ground breaking but a pretty decent interpretation on the style.  I found it to be refreshingly crisp and easy to drink.  Somehow this screamed summer to me not winter.  I enjoyed this and am glad I purchased a six pack because they are so easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Solid, easy drinking wit beer. Orange peel and plum work nicely"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not horrible, but a strange choice to me for a winter beer."
"This one is growing on me after an initial negative reaction. Gained a new respect for it after drinking a couple of Harpoon IPAs beforehand. I expected the Cold Snap to be nearly tasteless and overly sweet after that, but it held it's own. Obviously, a very different beer than an IPA, but it shone through for what it is: a decent, (although certainly not top notch)  witbier. There is a time, place, and mood for this beer (for me, anyway), and it fulfills it's purpose respectably enough. Definitely don't mind having a few kicking around in the fridge for when the mood strikes."
"Great tasting beer, but best not to drink too much as it quickly wears on you. Great for a pint or two with lunch."
""
""
""
"This product is like most sam Adams products."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spices, malts, some citrus. Taste is smooth and refreshing. Citrus, malts, wheat, spices, very easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
"Excellent take on a white ale.  I still miss Sam Adams White Ale, but this is a great replacement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I actually thought this one wasn't to bad, a decent witbier interpretation."

"12 ounce bottle, best before April 2014. A friend gave me a bottle recently, so I wasn't able to try it when it was fresher. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with a half inch white head. Heaed retention is decent enough, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells like orange peel, coriander, wheat/bready malt, and a bit of bubblegum. It tastes like orange peel, wheat/bready malt, coriander, and a sweet spiciness in general. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has low/moderate carbonation. I think it's an OK brew overall. I wouldn't turn one down, but I wouldn't make a point to seek it out either. With that being said, I would like to try a fresher bottle in the future."

"Final Grade: 3.97, a B+. Cold Snap is definitely one of my favourite Samuel Adams beers yet, and certainly one of the better witbiers available in Ontario at the moment. This is a tasty, thirst-quenching brew that I'd happily drink again, or recommend to anyone who happens to be interested in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dirty bronze - murky, touch of white foam atop. Little fruit nose, lemon zest, orange citrus nose. Bright tart fronting taste, with a little ending pucker. Spices embedded, coriander, pepper. Lemony. Overall a good spring beer. Better than recent ones (I'm looking at you Alpine Spring)."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was a suggestion of a friends while getting steaks. When it came out it had a hazy look in the glass, similar to Blue Moon, but not as bright. It had a decent smell, not as hoppy as other Sam Adams spring brews. To be it was average in taste, I would not shy away from it in the future, it is a good stand-by beer, but if I have some else to choose I will go with something else. This beer is better than the larger brands, but compares well with other craft beers. It is a good beer to have with steak."
""
""
"Taste is similar to the nose in that the sweet malt backing is the most dominate aspect, mild spicing of coriander and a slight yeasty character, carbonation is adequate although lower than it should be, finishes semi-sweet but not sticky or cloying, just not as dry as it could be."
""
""
"Overall: To me, this is just the same ""spiced ale"" the has been repackaged. How many times will Samuel Adams keep doing this?"
"O - I was excited to see this come out, figured it was a revival of Sam Adams white, but it falls short. Lacking in overall flavor, nothing really making me what to drink more."
""
""
"I bought this hoping it would be as good an early spring beer as the Alpine of a few years ago. Pours nicely with a good head but not so much decoration on the sides of my glass. Cloudy and golden it has a good look to it. The smell is different for the style with a large malt body that has less twang and more bread than is common. Notes of vanilla and and orange with light coriander. An almost bubblegum sweetness. Taste has a lot of fruitiness, ( the added plum ) and spices. Body is quite round and full with a lemony honey maltiness. The orange peel shows in the the finish with nice zesty kick while still being low in bitterness, just enough to refresh and clean the palate. Feel is on the thicker side for a wit with a mild carbonation. Not the home run of the Alpine by a longshot, but a decent quality beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad witbier. Was expecting a different style based on the name, something more typically taken in cold weather. They are making a unique twist by keeping the carbonation down and tartness up, keeping it dry in a way different than typical for the style."
"O-Sam Adams and their spiced witbiers have to go. For some reason they can not get this style done right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not really on my favorites list. It was ok, but nothing special."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: I've had a lot of white ales, and there are some that I really like and a lot that just don't do a lot for me. This one falls into that latter category. A few too many off-notes to be really enjoyable."
""
""
"Single bottle poured into a weizen glass. A cloudy yellow-orange, the standard witbier hue, with a quick-breaking but reasonably ample white head. Smells tangy, citric, almost a bit metallic or sanguine, with some light citrus and green notes apparent. Tastes like a proficiently brewed if not conservative wit, the coriander is right where it should be (i.e., barely detectable) and there is a pleasant orange and lemon water vibe running from start to finish. I get some wheat spice and a floral almost tobacco-like faint hop presence but nothing too aggressive. Maybe a hair thicker than the average witbier, with a super-clean citric finish, just a hint of woody spice seed. One-dimensional but tasty enough I suppose. Does not match the grandeur of St. Bernardus Wit, Blanche De Chambly, or the like but does not embarrass itself either."
""
""
"Appearance holds a cloudy yellow orange color supporting a dissipating head. Smell of the citrus, wheat, mild malt, hop and spice. Taste follows the aroma having a citrus spiciness to it. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Seem to make for a nice seasonal session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an OK holiday Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Scent is a citrus , soapy lemon. Appearance is hazy yellow orange with a decent white head. Head dissipates quickly, no lacing. Taste is of lemons and clove. Nothing very stimulating, neither good nor bad. Soapy aftertaste. Meh!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another day of free movies, another half-hour break, another chance to grab a pint at Beelow's. This time it's a seasonal wit from Sam Adams, which pours a hazy tawny-orange topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose is your usual wit base, comprising orange peel, light coriander, cracked wheat, and a twist of lemon; added on is a decently strong sense of straight grain, leaving things to take on a white bread sort of aroma, luckily mostly throughout the background. The taste brings in more of the same, that same white bread bit now a bit louder, but still second tier. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda crisp finish. Overall, an okay wit, but that breadiness really holds it back. If nothing else, it's better than the Cubs' performance in St. Louis..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Tastes a little like their Summer ale or maybe even a less sweet Blue Moon. Quite drinkable and somewhat refreshing but definitely nothing exciting. I wouldn't bother with this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing. A seasonal Sam Adams you'll look forward to every winter."
""
""
""
""
"I apparently enjoyed Samuel Adams Cold Snap a lot more than most other reviewers; it could just be that I really like the style (although this isn't the first time, it seems to be a trend). Hesitant at first, I was glad to have bought an entire six-pack. In fact, I'll probably buy another next spring."
""
""
""
""
"O - a fairly standard witbier offering as far as mouthfeel and appearance go, but perhaps a little too fruity in a boxed cereal kind of way for the witbier affiocionado. Good, not awesome. Pair it with wheat beer foods."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, it has a murky orange color body with small creamy head. The aroma has a peppery and coriander smell to it. The taste has spicy characters to it, pepper and coriander are the ones I pick up. I also get a little citrus on the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and overall a really tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a fairly easy drinking spring beer for the breaking of seasons. Not to bold, but an easy drinking, relaxing beer with just the right amount of sweet and spicy nature to spring into the new season with. Light, crisp, easy drinking multiple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall not a bad witbier. however much better on tap. i only rate brews at the time i drink them. since i don't have a keg at home this review is from bottles."
""
""
"The feel starts off bright but never reaches that light fluffiness and creamy texture the style strives for. In the middle, after the smoothness drops off, comes an almost pithy, chalky dryness that's a little too hard rather than lightly acidic."
""

"Samuel Adams Cold Snap Brew by Boston Beer Company. Pours out of the bottle with a small white head. The color is a cloudy amber color. It has the appearance of apple cider but lighter. This beer is not filtered so it is cloudy. The smell of this brew is sweet with citrus , also smell rich. This brew has smell and look of other wheat beers on the market. The taste is ok nothing fancy but you can taste the citrus. I not picking up on the plum in this brew. Cold Snap goes down smooth and crisp, not a bad brew at all. There is nothing bad about the taste or smell of this brew. This would be a nice beer to drink on spring night after a long day. Over all I giving Samuel Adams Cold Snap a 4 out 5 one of the better Samuel Adams brews I had ."

""

"Very easy to drink."
"O-not much depth to the flavor here, easy drinking"
"I see alot of Illinoisans and Hoosiers have tasted this one recently. We know what we are talking about when it comes to beer and Pizza. This is definitely a good pizza pub drinker."
""

""
""
"Draught: This one pours a murky yellow color. There was a bit of a white foam head that left some lacing. The aroma is OK. Some wheat, touch of orange and some coriander. The taste is OK. Some wheat, touch of the coriander and faint orange. Not the best Witbier, but not bad either."
""
""
"O: An easy drinker but kind of boring. Not the best representation of the style either. It was like they decided to mix the darker maltiness of most of their other beers and mix it into this witbier."
""
"This beer is okay, and I could enjoy a couple, but I don't want to settle for this because there are so many better beers of this style."
"overall: I enjoyed drinking this beer, it is not unlike Blue Moon and made by a craft brewer. This is probably my favorite beer from Samuel Adams so far. The ABV of 5.3% means you can enjoy one while grilling steaks and one or two more with your meal. Very drinkable, I would buy this again no problem."

"Over all I really enjoyed this beer and even bought some at the store."

"This was enjoyable. Nothing really jumps out, but all in all it's very drinkable and good tasting. The smell has a that Sam Adams holiday spice character to it with a dose of citrus mixed in; this goes for the taste as well. It's good, but I wouldn't get it again."

"on at local eatery. Very simple uncomplicated beer. HAzy but that may have been the glass. I ordered it not knowing it was called cold snap. i only knew that this was the only thing the restaurant had that was even close to craft. I though it may have been a wheat beer at first, but then couldnt think of any wheat beers from sam, until now . I was better than any adjunct lager thats for sure..."
"This was a nice surprise. It's lighter than most Sam Adams (taste, not color), but it still had good body. Interesting that they went with something like this for a cold weather beer. It almost has citrus notes, which I enjoy. Nice finish, low bitterness, so I would recommend this for people that don't normally try high hoppy beers. All in all I really enjoyed it."

"Not sure why this beer is getting tagged as such a low quality sud. As a connoisseur of wheat beer this is a better than average brau. Forget that a mass marketer (or at least a large scale microbrew) makes it. It pours a hazy unfiltered golden color with moderate carbonation. Leaves slight lacing around the glass when sipping it. Gives the wheat taste with a large amount of citrus, mainly orange and if I'm not mistaken has the coriander vibe going as well. Great session beer weighing in at 5.3 abv and I'd give it the edge on Blue Moon. Worth checking out and grabbing as a party pleaser beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden, pale, and hazy developing a very short head which quickly dissipates. The nose has notes of citrus and wheat. Medium light body with some hints of coriander and orange peel and apricot on the palate. Malty sweetness. Short. Some lace does does develop. Thirst quenching."

"I am not a huge wit fan but I’d say that this is not quite done to style."

"Overall: Not usually a fan of Sam Adams witbiers, but I found this one to be very drinkable and better than most. Refreshing and clean, it may be my favorite in this year's spring variety pack."
"While not a breakthrough beer it does the job of bringing you out of the rich winter brews heading towards the lighter beers of warm weather."

"a remarkably surprisingly good beer here, winter seasonal, not expected to be anything special, but this is darn good. like a blue moon in some sense, with out the herbal properties and the yeast intensity, i like this a lot. not that hazy, and not that pale, doesnt really look the part, but it has a robust two inches of white head that dont fade a lick. the nose is nice, a little sweet, definitely grain driven, with a light citrus hopping and fresh bread aromatics, breakfast bread. the flavor is similar, heavier wheat malt base is nice, and the leftover sugar really is too. it gives some pleasant body, but the beer stays light due to excellent carbonation. there is almost a lemongrass flavor to it, a somewhat fruity somewhat grassy element i cannot quite place, but it makes this beer stand out from the crowd. i am surprised i liked this as much as i did, a semi-macro-ish seasonal witbier. turns out is exceptional, crossing the boundary between refreshing and hearty, extremely enjoyable really. creamy and flavorful."
""
""
""

"Overall: A nice break from the typical winter brews. The 6-pack was enough though, I wouldn't get it again. Seems like they were going for a Blue Moon copy. If they were, I'd say they pretty much succeeded."

"Samuel Adams Cold Snap (2014) - Head diminishes quickly to smooth lacing. Small amounts of carbonation. Deep hazy orange yellow color. Smells of citrus-- lemons, oranges, and passion fruit. Some wheat grass. Wet mouthfeel. Wheat, cinnamon, and orange on the nose. Lemons, oranges, and some bread mid-palate. Lemon grass, spiced hops, and a little alcohol nip on the back palate. Clean aftertaste. Light hops and barley. Some oranges. Very clean and drinkable for a wheat beer. Not overly fruity. Strong classic Belgian Ale character. Smooth and well done. 3.5 out of 5. Good."

"The Cold Snap is very similar to all the other White Ales that Samuel Adams has produced. The beer pours a hazy yellow with sparse white head that is not lacing. The scent carries spice. The taste is a nice blend of spice and hops and there is a nice sweet finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer....but nothing spectacular."

"Overall: Sam Adams seems to change its Spring seasonal every year, and I'm glad they made this switch. Would love to see it as an annual, as it would work for all seasons. If you have a friend who swears by Blue Moon, slip them one of these - it's better. Also better than most Spring seasonals globally. Would drink again."
"Overall: My main problem with Cold Snap was the lack of malts. The orange and spice were good but they need malts in order to round this one out. This was refreshing but is not a beer I will run out to buy more of any time soon."

""
""

"Its light and grainy body is creamy to start but quickly fall apart because of its scrubbing mineral and grain qualities. Crystal-clean in its delivery, that also becomes the beer's problem. It's so clean that it reveals the grain flavor and texture to limit its enjoyment. It also highlights is plaster-like taste and texture to much the same malaise."
""

""

"Overall/ I am not a big fan of the witbier style but being Sam Adams I wanted to give it a try. It fits the style characteristics almost to a tee. Just not my style. It is not something that I want to drink frequently but a change that is ok once in a while."

"A decent enough version of a witbier, sort of faded around the edges, but the meat of the matter is still intact. Which is all fine and good, but this is certainly a warm(er) weather offering, so I'm thinking there's something lost in translation here - up here, a 'cold snap' is a prolonged period of sub-zero temps - I'm guessing that BBC assumes a different stress, as in 'a snap to the existing cold' i.e. springtime, y'all."

"Hazy golden hue with a crisp mouth feel; it has an aroma and taste that is reminiscent of citrus; more so of oranges. I'm a fan of these types of beers because I much rather pair my beer with a slice of orange of any other citrus. It's reminiscent other other beers like Shock Top but it has a distinction all it's own. I'm a big fan of wheat beers; the murky haze of a wheat ale makes me feel like I'm drinking something hearty and not just beer flavored water!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a weisse vase, the beer is opaque, yellow-orange coloring with a thin, whispy white head. Nose of citrus sweet, pound cake, pineapple, and toasted grains. Flavors are citrus forward, with a subtle bready backbone and some light spicing. Smooth and light in mouth, with a sweet and sugary aftertaste. Light, smooth finish. Tastes like a knockoff of the old White to me."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, dirty blonde color. White frothy head subsides to a ring and leaves little lace. Aroma of wheat, and a bit of a fruity twang. In the taste, citrus, firm malt, and mild clove all dial in. There is a lemony aspect to the brew, as well as a small, earthy bitterness. Medium bodied and easy drinking brew. The tangy citrus lingers into the finish for quite a while. Overall, a pretty refreshing wheat here. Accessible and would appeal to a wide audience of beer drinkers."

"Not sure what BBC was going for here, but it's not a good example of the witbier style. It's not bad, but it's a bit macro tasting, especially on the finish. Don't think I'll be having this one again."
""
""
""
"O - I could see this an easy to drink dog days of summer beer, but during this the great artic winter of 2014, it seems oddly out of place. It isn't terrible, but it's hardly great either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only difference between this and blue moon is that its not served with an orange peel. The taste is dominated by sweetness and oranges with a little bit of wheat. Not much worth noting in the aroma or mouthfeel department. Seems like sam adams is trying to compete with blue moon and shocktop on this rather than a serious attempt at a witbier like allagash. Overall a decent beer, but nothing to revisit.  (68/100)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I give this around the C+ to B- range. I don't think I'd buy this beer again (not that it was horrible). I wasn't a huge fan of the dark fruitiness. And it could have been less sweet. But in general, the Cold Snap was a very well put together beer that wouldn't offend anyone."

"Overall - decent crowd pleaser for those just venturing into the craft beer scene."

"Hazy yellow, almost off orange color with a very white head that was about a finger on the top of the beer. Head lingered for a little while. Smells heavy on the orange and wheat and tastes the same Very light and easy to drink. This is a beer for wheat fans who like a little extra fruit flavor in their without going all the way to a fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In my opinion this was a terrific beer. Great smell, feel, taste, I was in love with the aftertaste. Couldn't quite put my finger on what the aftertaste was though. It reminded me of the taste of buttered popcorn jelly beans. I really loved this. I got it on tap at Ruby Tuesdays and couldn't be more happy with picking it over all the options. I highly recommend."
"The appearance is pale yellow, with a white head that dissolves quickly. The light and crisp citrus plays on the smell in the forefront with a little bit of wheat on the back end. I loved the smell. Very fizzy on the first sip with many of the citrus flavors coming out. A lot of lemongrass and a little bit of coriander and spice on the end. It was a lot lighter than I thought it was going to be from the smell but I ended up liking that. It's still a bit too cold for this beer but by March or April I can definitely see grabbing a twelve pack or two. One of my only criticisms is that it's very similar to their White Christmas."
"Light to medium mouthfeel. Easy drinking. Not a ""wow"" beer but solid for sure. I'd recommend it to those who like wheat beers."
""
""
"O: I can't get the image of an old lady salon out of my head when drinking this beer. Not a winning seasonal but a decent offering to session. I wanted to like this but it's too safe and lacks creativity."

"I was pleasantly surprised when I first sipped this beer. It has a nice 3 finger head, very cloudy..I loved the White Ale and it was snatched away by Sam Adams. I looked forward to that beer every spring. That being said, Cold Snap is very similar and familiar. It has a classic old Samuel Adams scent, with orange peel, coriander, lemon zest, and grainy wheat. The scent is also very floral. Where I think it does out do White Ale is the aftertaste, which is sweet, not cloying, and crisp. Anytime Jim Koch puts a light blue cap on the bottle, it's a good one!"

"Overall worth picking up and a fairly decent Witbier. Worth picking up just to stick it to Coors."
"This beer is decent- nothing too special, but worth the $6.99 a six pack or whatever. I do like the idea of wheat beer as a winter time brew, since the spices seem to go well with it."
""
""
""
"Hazy light brown to amber in color. A quarter inch white foam entirely covers the top of this beer. I get a bit of coriander and pale wheat in the nose. The mouth is brisk and sharp. I get a faint hint of orange peel,but mainly restrained usage of coriander(which is oh so easy to overdo). This Belgian wit is restrained,but well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Originally got it in a sampler but liked it and bought more. Good cost for a sixer. Good looking beer, typical wheat that smells great, clean and sweet. Excellent tasting beer, sweet and crisp. Enjoyed it very much and will revisit regularly. But why is this a winter beer, would make a great summer beer. Sam Adams finally nailed one, this one is top shelf."

""
"Cold Snap - Decent appearance, a weird mixture of scents, but a mouthfeel unlike a brew I have had in quite some time. I did find that smell of the brew matched the taste, but I like the taste over the beer's smell, way much more. Overall, I enjoyed the brew and would definitely down a few more given the chance."
""
""

"O- I enjoyed this beer. After warming, the flavors expanded to create a nice mix of flavors. I wouldn't object to having again."
""

"O - What a weird beer. It's all over the place with off flavors, odors, and feels, like some sort of Frankenstein's Monster. The joke is on me though, as this is definitely NOT like any of SA's recent witbier offerings. NOT good, either."
""
""

"At $2.99 for a bomber, I thought it was a good price. It just isn't a very good beer."

"A very tasty witbier. The citrus flavors are very prominent yet meld well with the malt and wheat grains. Outstanding depth and complexity and very well-balanced throughout. It's been a while since I've been fire-up about a witbier or even a Sam Adam's product, but this particular brew excels across the board for this style."
"O: I used to love the original Samuel Adams White Ale and have expressed varying degrees of satisfaction and disappointment with each subsequent take on the style the company has released. Cold Snap, however, takes me back to my discovery of that beer and my early days of imbibing craft beers. If you, like me, enjoyed the original Samuel Adams White Ale, you will be delighted to know that Cold Snap is a worthy replacement. Many of the flavor components are the same, and all in all, it is probably as close to the original as we are going to get at this point."
"O: refreshing and highly drinkable."

"Poured a golden orange body with minimal head and lace with a decent witbier aroma of minor citric hops/spice and touches of yeast. Beer is smooth and easy to drink but too simplistic to be a great wit (more commercialized). The spice and coriander are minimal on the edges to add a little oomph to the citric flavors and it finishes light and with a crisp edge. Not a bad beer and there were touches of sweetness at times in the beer."

"Orange hazy ale. Wreaking head but nice lacing. Clean, citrus aroma. Big orange and tangerines right away on the palate. Hints of floral spices. Fresh, leafy, veggie like hop. Well balanced. Medium bodied. High carbonation. Crisp, refreshing finish. Great beer for end of winter or early spring."
""
"Overall: A damn good witbier. I am not a big drinker of the style, but this was a nice one to have. Like many beers from the Boston Beer Company, this would make a good gateway beer to those newer to craft beers, and it's definitely something to have those who swear by Blue Moon to try. It still surprises me that the Samuel Adams line expands at a near-alarming rate, yet the beers are consistently winners."
""
""

""
""

"O: Pretty average for a Wit... Not bad at all, but not above average. Good ABV so it is a good session beer."

"I am dismissing this beer as bad marketing."

"Not bad, quite easy drinking and gong nicely with salad, nuts and goat cheese. Respectable seasonal from SA"
""

"O: This is not something that will set the world on fire, but I can still say it's honestly quite good. I like it better than Alpine Spring, too - actually, I'll go one better, and say it's my favorite SA seasonal regular to date. It's not saying a whole lot; still, I'd entertain the notion of buying a 6-pack of this."
"Poured into my trusty Stella Artois pint glass. Clean crisp and very clear with minimal head. Went down really smooth. The taste is above average and one of the best white beers i have had in a long time. It really hit the spot on a very cold Indiana day when we were colder than the other 49 states"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is pretty much a mix of yeast and spice with the wheat playing a subordinate role and still adding enough to make the flavor cohesive, but not extraordinary. I like the way you taste coriander right away and it does make it a bit snappy (pun intended) with a nice peppery aspect with the orange element taking second and that helps the wheat malt which is the foundation, not much else to comment on except I like how the taste finishes dry. Overall I enjoy what Samuel Adams does with wheat - I know we are not talking Infinium but this is pretty good as far as Wit beers go."

"For an offering from a macrobrew, this year's S.A. excels. Light, crisp, fresh, perfect compliment to a winter evening at the lodge."

"Overall, well.... not enjoyable in the least. By far one of the worst beers from Boston Beer Co that I've had in a very long time. Wheat, OK, but too much wheat, orange zest, meh, just weird orange icing flavors, and fake vanilla, with other spices, into a pre-digested gingerbread and orange cake with tons of orange frosting that's just not good. Even the finish doesn't know how to, um, finish, between the sticky, dry, creamy, syrupy, etc. Can't imagine why they would put this out, I can't even finish it. I almost want to order this at a bar one day, so I can spit it in their face and demand a different beer, just so I can waste it... then again it might taste better spit out."

"This Samuel Adams brew is similar to Blue Moon and other macro- brewed white ales in many ways. I find it agreeable and likeable, but I know there are those who will criticize it for not being unique or full- bodied enough. It seems like a decent beer for those times when you just want a simple white ale without the pretense. Give it a try if you can- it’s easy to find and has enough going for it to recommend."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of a Witbier with spices and orange peels, it had good balance with the orange being right below the point of being too much with just enough spices to provide some balance and all that smoothness that comes with the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, refreshing, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention and I could see myself drinking a few of these once it starts to warm up outside, it's got about the same drinkability as Oberon. What I liked the most about this beer was how the spices weren't overdone, that tends to happen often in this style, but not with this beer. What i liked the least about this beer was that they put it out and promote it so early, I like the beer, just not when it's still below freezing in Michigan, but I'm sure in a few months from now it will fit in good with the weather. I might buy this again when it gets warmer, but there's good chance I'll just go with Oberon instead. I would recommend this if you like your Witbiers heavy on the orange. All in all I didn't mind this beer, it was good for what it is and I find it to be similar to Oberon, but I like Oberon more since Oberon tastes more wheaty with a nice yeast flavor. Nice work guys, this was a solid example of the style, keep up the solid work."
"Pours a nice cloudy yellowish color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, slight bananna, with some spices. The taste is malty, yeasty, with some spice notes. Medium body. Overall a tasty little brew."
""
"This beer, from the spring mix pack, is a cloudy, ultra hazy straw color. The smell is soft and subtle, with a a little wheat and some orange and lemon scents. Coriander and paper. The flavor is moderately sweet, not at all bitter, a bit citrusy, and spicy in the finish. Smooth and enjoyable, but not inspiring."

"Overall: Not being a huge fan of wheat beer, I liked this one. Picked up in a variety pack so I am hoping the other's deliver as well as this one."

"A refreshing ale, though the fruit/spice additions, while well balanced and welcome are not at all restrained, so this is almost a specialty beer rather than a true wit-bier."

"Overall - The 'brewed with spice with spice added' line on the bottle scared me, as I was expecting a nasty spice bomb, but this is actually very close to your traditional wit. In all, it's okay. Pretty run of the mill craft wit. Nothing I'd necessarily buy again, but if it finds it's way into next spring's mix pack, I won't avoid it."

"Eminently drinkable, but more like a spring or summer beer (a late April cold snap? or something to remind you of spring when its far off). Maybe a bit too insubstantial?"

"This pours a hazy dark lemonade color with a slight white head. The aroma is mild with sweet citrus, coriander, and wheat. The flavor is very similar to Blue Moon with the use of orange and spices that are mixed with wheat. The finish is a little unusual with a dry bite."

"Poured into my tulip, bright hazy yellow with an orange tint, bright white head. Very sweet smelling, clean musty, herbal aroma. I was very happy to find it tasted very similar to Alpine Spring, granted they are two different styles. Sweeter that Alpine Spring, less hop bitterness. All around great beer."
"Pours a hazy medium golden color with a huge fluffy head that persists forever. Aromas of lime and pepper dominate as well as a meringue kind of thing going on. Light wheaty spice and coriander round out the nose. The flavor is lightly sweet with honey and wow again it's like key lime pie with a bit of pepper and coriander thrown in. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. This beer surprise me a bit, but I really kind of enjoyed it."

" Pours a hazy apricot in color with a good 1+-finger white head but didn't last a long time. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip though the ring settled back to the top. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of light fruits with a slight light orange-peel. The taste is very pleasing with the fruits and spices of a peppery-bite of corriander coming through that ends in a slight dryness on the tongue for the finish. Very easy to drink and goes down easy. Sam Adam's has some great seasonal brews out there and this one will not disapoint."
"Overall, the beer is pretty drinkable (meaning it goes down easy), but it has a safe and commercial feel to it (although that may be in part due to my expectations). It tastes comparable in quality to Blue Moon. Overall, this is better than most of Sam Adams's seasonable beers, but it's not something I'd seek out."
""
""
"This is thoroughly OK. Slightly better than Blue Moon, perhaps, but well below a good Wit or Weizen. Not sure which they were shooting for, but it comes across more like the former."
""
""
""
""
"Drinks easy enough, but nothing to get excited about. Sort of a training-wheels Wit"
""
""

"Overall – Too thick and heavily spiced. Not really something that I found all that palatable."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty strong. Large head, but no real lacing. Nose is fruity and spicy. Starchy white bread, sweet fruits, citrus fruits, and spice. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Overall: Good potential in the flavor, the rest is meh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another middle of the road offering from Sam Adams. The bubblegum esters are slightly offputting to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a light, wheaty, not particularly compelling beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice easy drinking beer that is probably the most refreshing of the Spring Variety Pack."
""
"I'm normally a Sam Adams fan but this one didnt make the cut. OTOH I have never liked the Belgian style and this is a bit of that...."
""
""

"The taste is also of soft and breaded malts with a notable oat character followed by a crispy mlldly bitter lingering finish."
"cold snap is a fresh tasting little brew. it pours a cloudy straw yellow. the smell is a mix of light fruit and coriander. the taste is really light. there isnt much going on. this is a good beer to compete with blue moon drinkers. over all its not a bad beer if you are in the mood for a light citrus. i may buy some of this and save it for warmer months, i think it would be better in the summer."
""

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and floral flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice fruity presence in the aroma and flavor."

"I am a fan of big, complex beers, but sometimes it is nice to find a beer that is a good, consistent easy drinker that you can have a few of while watching a game. This is what Sam Adams has done here, as this is an above average take on this style. I think they finally found a Spring seasonal they can stick with, unless they decide to make it year round."
""
""
"The Verdict: I like it. A Belgian white ale with very good balance and a nice mouthfeel. Much better than the Alpine Spring it replaces, this could easily become a SA favorite for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, this is Sam Adams version of a Blue Moon, with maybe a little more spice. If thats your beer, you'll love this."
""
"Really tasty beer, Sam Adams seems to have had an identity crises the past several years on sticking with a spring seasonal, but this time, I think they got it right. I was very happy with the ""White Ale"" they had from 2004-2010, but then they went all over the place with Noble Pils, and Alpine Spring. This time, they brought back the White Ale, with a little extra.. very well done, really hope they stick with this one this time!"
