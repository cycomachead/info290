"Refreshing, clean tasting wheat with spices reminiscent of a Belgian blonde ale. Decent."
""
""
"A decent hefe style.  A bit sour on the aftertaste."
""
""
""
"looks good, smells good but the taste leaves a bit to be desired. I'm typically a fan of witbiers but with this one the coriander was a little overpowering"
""
""
"Perfect beer. Anytime out west, I try to find a sixer of this. One of my all time favorite beers. The spices perfectly compliment the white ale. Had it straight from the brewery and was even better than the bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  this is okay, but not great.  Even though I was hoping for something more interesting in the taste department, I still found this to be pretty refreshing.  Doesn't really strike me as a proper wit..."

"Pours a pale yellow with good clarity.  Some yeast / banana peel in the nose. Taste of some spices, lemon grass, coriander.  Low bodied mouth feel with a slight bitter aftertaste.  Meh, I probably won't be coming back to this one, but that is more due to the style is not in my wheelhouse."

"kinda plain and light, not my fave"
"Hands down my favorite White Ale."

"This is a decent, drinkable, refreshing summer ale but will disappoint if you are expecting a wit."
""
"White pours a pale straw color with a very small non lacing head.  There is a very mellow sweet and crisp aroma.  The taste is light but crisp, lots of citrus fruits, hints of orange and lemon. Weaker body, watery flavors, stronger fruit flavors.  Overall its a very light beer, with big fruit flavors, no traditional witbier flavors."
""
""
"O - Would be a good fishing beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice Summer beer that I'll put off to the side until next year. Cheers."

"Glass half empty edit: Noticing some bread flavors and still very light hops. Enjoying this one. The bread adds a nice texture to it that might be what makes it go down so smooth. Either the lights have dimmed or this has beer has become a bit more hazy in appearance. Still would love to have another. Not sure what the grains are, but sensing a presence of wheat (thus the haze), and maybe a light biscuit flavored variety. Good stuff !"

"Overall - Unimpressed. I was expecting more since I've really fallen for the Witbier style. Hoegaarden and Blue Moon are two great examples of what I look for in a Belgian White/Wheat aka Witbier style and in my opinion this brewery's take on it is less than satisfactory. There are worse beers out there but I think for a Belgian White this one has been the worst so far."

"Poured from bottle to glass. White head that quickly dissipated, hazy orange yellow appearance. Decent amount of carbonation. Smells of orange, wheat, and cinnamon. Tasted citrus, sweet, not bitter, hint of spicy notes, coriander. Crisp finish. Overall average wheat ale."
""
""
""
"Flavor: the grassy wheat flavor leads the way, there is some grape/raisin flavor in the finish. A bit of lemon and floral hops round out the flavor."

"I had never heard of this brand before, this was a blind request. Until checking in here I had no idea this was a wheat beer - I thought it was Alaskan's attempt at a North American macrobrew. More quality than an NA macro, though with little pretty lacing and no purity of opacity."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle, sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
"Overall- Average to above average. A thin representation of the style but otherwise true. It's not a bad beer at all so I would give it a try. Just don't expect much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/Palate: There is a big spicy clove and sweet lemony/orange presence up front with light wheat notes backing it up. I also get a slight astringent note and some pale hop bitterness on the back end. This all comes in a smooth feeling medium bodied package"

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It is well carbonated and leaves a little film on the tongue. It is refreshing with a slightly dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy yellow with a two finger white head. Standard for the style. Scents of coriander, yeast, wheat malt and slight orange peel. Again, nothing fantastic and stand out, but true to style. Flavors of coriander, wheat bread, slight citrus flavors with a moderate hop bitterness and a dry finish. Quite nice, again true to style, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Quite easy to drink. A good, but not spectacular, example of a witbier. Better than Hoegaarden and Blue Moon, not as good as Allagash White. Still worth having at least once."
""
""
""
"Overall: an average beer. The malty accents are probably the highlight. Light and refreshing. Nothing to go out of your way for though"
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention is mild.  Lacing is moderate.  Has a wheat aroma with banana; maybe some orange peel.  Seems a little on the stale or ripened side.  Upon sipping, you get a wheaty, bready taste, followed by a more spicy, maybe cinnamon, banana flavor.  Slightly bitter.  More of a mild banana aftertaste but not much substance."
"This was my first review, I apologize for its shittyness."
"Flavors of sweet malts, herbal medley, rosemary water, lemongrass. Overall flavorful with some body and complexity, but light on the overall malts, hops and alcohol. Tasty session or hot day brew."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/12/2013. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers for a bit. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of pear, coriander, orange peel, wheat, light pepper, light clove, floral, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with decent balance and complexity; but there is not much going on here other than the spicing. Taste of pear, coriander, orange peel, wheat, pepper, light clove, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruit, coriander, orange peel, wheat, pepper, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of spice/malty flavors, without feeling watery; and no cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a solid witbier. Solid balance of flavors and easy to drink; just really not all that exciting. Enjoyable stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"I immediately regret buying the pint glass before buying the beer. Although decent enough as a heat beater, there is nothing memorable enough about this brew to entice me to purchase it again. By far the worst of the Alaskan products I have sampled, and I suspect I would go with the ubiquitous Golden, Colorado alternative before giving this another shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - there is definitely some potential with this flavour mix, but it just doesn't quite go far enough to make it more than average"
""
""
""
""
""
"it's not outstanding but it's a solid witbier."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light golden amber, thin fine white head with good retention and slippery lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, Belgian yeast, wit spicing, light orange. Very attenuated flavor of sweet floral, bready malt and wheat, slight spicing. Flavors are all pleasant, but this tastes almost watered down. Light bodied, but that is to style. This is the biggest surprise I've had from Alaskan, not bad, but very subdued. The weakest flavored wit I've ever tasted. I'll be very satisfied to finish the bottle, but will probably not try again."
"Unfortunately thin finish lets this down. A shame since the flavours really appeal to me. Be great in the summer though."
""
"However, even with that macro flavor profile, it is much more crisp and and enjoyable. I'd definitely give this one another try at some point, and would not turn it down, especially with that cute picture on it, but I don't know, meh."
""
""
""
""
"This was enjoyable, good flavors and lots of drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just not good. I've been working through an Alaskan 12 pack mixer and this is the worst by far. Can I trade the other one for another Amber please?!"
""
""
""
"The drinkability on this is exceptional. Would make a nice session beer. Other than that, nothing too special of a beer, but very enjoyable on this hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Something I have had on many occasions. A very nice Wit. An easy to drink everyday beer with plenty of character. Something I would recommend."
"3.5 D: Not the typical witbier, but tasty nonetheless. Lots of corriander, which is my favorite part of a wit."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden murky color, darker than most wits, with a nice white filmy head. Smells nice and fruity, with a hint of citrus, banana and wheat. The taste is a lot of orange and banana with a hint of lemon and wheat. It has a medium body with some soft carbonation and a refreshing finish."
""
"o - i am a fan of ABC's beers but this was a huge disappointment."
""
""
"Ahoy hoy!"
""
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat with a hint of coriander thrown in. The flavor has quite a bit more orange peel in it, as well as some coriander and wheat. Overall, this is a basic Belgian White, with well balanced notes and easy drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Overall - An average witbier. Fairly basic. Would buy again if options were limited, but there are at least a dozen other witbiers I'd rather have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a pretty drinkable beer for a hot summer day in Texas! Not amazing but worth the try! i would go for a hoegarden!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would say this is the best Alaskan beer I've had yet. Much better than the Amber."
""
""
"O: Not the best example of a traditional witbier, just barely a step up than the US macro versions."
""
""
""
"Overall it's a nice summer session beer, but not a good example of a witbier."
""
""
""
""
"pretty standard white beer here. pours an only slightly cloudy blonde color with a nice white head. smells spiced or herbed, with fruity yeast and plenty of sweetness. taste for me was too sweet, lots of sugars in there. can taste the coriander, and a bit of hops on the back end. feel is nice, lots of carbonation and a fairly light body. it gets bogged down by its sweetness in my opinion, but the flavor profile under all that is quite nice. not my favorite beer from these guys though."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is OK, but just a bit weak/watery."
""
"although pretty average, i found this to be the right beer at the right time on a very warm and windy mid-March day here in the northland. after a day of doing yardwork instead of fighting floods and snowstorms, this hit the spot on a glorious late winter/early spring day."
""
"Compared pretty much side by side with the wheat monkey, both beers were pretty unimpressive."
"Not much Belgian quality here, more of a weak American wheat ale with a grain bill that darkens the bright wheat flavor and basic spices. Would not revisit."
""
""
"Pours a murky light orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, spices, and yeast. Taste is of sweet wheat and some subtle spice flavors. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good witbier that is easy to drink."
""
"On-tap at Old Chicago's. Served to a pint glass. The beer arrives a hazy pale amber color, light in color, with a 1/2 finger white cap. Some retention and lacing throughout. The nose is sweet and contains hints of fruity spice such as coriander, hints of orange and lemon and wheat. The flavor very much follows suit with a malty wheat sweetness, hints of lemons, orange and coriander spice. Mildly bitter. Creamy in nature. Lingers with hints of spicy sweetness and fruit. Wheat flavor is strong, though, perhaps a little much so. Good carbonation and lighter mouthfeel. Overall, not the best witbier but not bad at all. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
"O - Ljght, crisp and spicy for a wheat. Not bad."
""
"Just enough hops for me, just enough pretty fruit and spice, but can't ever imagine having more than one. But, here's to those that will!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yea, this one's only accepting applications from big fans of coriander. Fluffy wheat base and the coriander give it a sweet feel to it and a hefty body. Drinkability is through the roof, I could easily chug the whole glass in one or two sips. I am surprised at the fairly low scores for this one, I am enjoying the shit out of it. Alaskan has one of the most solid regular lineups of any brewery in the country, in my opinion. Love their beers."
""
"O - This is a very nice witbier. Yet another solid offering from Alaskan Brewing."
"D - Subtly complex, and highly sessionable. I will reach for this one again."
"C+"
"O-A boring beer. Not much to write home about. Saving grace would be that you can throw a few back if you ever wanted to."
""
""
""
"O: Its mildly enjoyable and definitely drinkable but I can think of a lot of readily available beers I enjoy more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this served at a good temperature, with a small, rapidly vanished off white head and no lace. Color is a clear amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is beery, yeast, spice, malt, grass. Flavor is like nose and is dominated by carbonic tang and yeast, followed by malt and a little spice. Barest hint of orange, maybe I'm even imagining it. Body is ok, but carbonation is very fizzy. Finish is like flavor, fairly short and forgettable."

"I was really excited to learn that WI was going to get some beer distributed from Alaska, it seemed so exotic, so far away. Poured out a translucent darker gold color, one finger of foam that dissipated in about a minute, no real lacing. I was expecting a lot more head than this. Thinner bodied, but effervescent like a soda with the level of carbonation present. Smells of light grains and orange zest with some minor murky floral hop undertones, taste follows the nose to a T. But I failed to detect as much complexity as I have had in other witbiers... I can't find any coriander, any tartness, or spice. Hopefully Alaskan Brewing's other offerings are better than this was."
"O-Nice easy drinking white. Not as sweet as most American witbiers. Nothing outstanding about this beer-just a solid drinking beer that I will be glad to have more of."
"Drinkability: Very light and thin, and the typical subtle flavors and spices of the Witbier style are overpowered by the hops in this one. Not a great example of the style. Probably wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Not impressed overall, especially since my only other Alaskan beer thusfar was the Smoked Porter. A step up from BMC lager types but besides that don't waste your time/money."
"O: Enjoyable, sweet but not syrupy or overpowering."
"In total a decent beer, but lacks the fruitiness and zestiness that I desire. I also pick up diacetyl, which I find off-putting."
"Overall, a fairly straightforward wit. Nothing out of the ordinary, but easy drinking."
"O: This wit has no balance. Too much orange peel. No yeast character. No Coriander. Its better then blue moon but not much."
"T: It's a little on the heavy side for a wit. The coriander and orange are definitely there, but it just feels a little too heavy for me."
"O-well the tastes aren't amazing but its extremely drinkable and tasty nonetheless. its something i wouldn't mind drinking all nght on any night of the week."
"O: Another reasonable crisp, quaffable summer sessionable beer, and very low priced for a single, though not something I would seek out again, I would accept if passed to me."
"O: Not bad since I'm not the biggest fan of this style. Not the most drinkable by any means."
"Very drinkable. This was a great beer for a warm sunny afternoon at the tiki bar poolside. Wish I could get it around here."
"Light bodied, average carbonation, crisp, smooth, and clean. I can see drinking this beer over and over during the summer months."
"Overall: A very tasty and interesting take on a Witbier. I really like the coconut finish. It makes this beer stand out to me among other American versions of this style."
"Murky, pale yellow. Thin white head. Lacing is moderate. Aroma is very fragrant and fresh. Great corriander notes with a little orange zest coming through as well. Flavor is very well received. Nice wheat base with great spicing accenting. Freshly crushed corriander, lemon, orange... Very refreshing a flavorful. One of the better wits I've run across. Lingering dryness begs another sip. Moderate to moderately high carbonation. Great wit."
"Overall: Overall this has a nice orange-like flavor, but it isn't really a Wit, as it lacks Belgian yeast and the crisp dryness I expect. More like an American Wheat with loads of orange. Certainly drinkable and refreshing but I have little desire to have it again."
"Overall - not a bad brew in general, but also not terribly complex, although still interesting to taste. Would go well with a Thai meal or something like that."
"O- its tasty and refreshing easy to drink good hint of citrus malts and spices"
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of oranges, with a hint of coriander. It is rather weak for the style. The taste is a little fuller and more spicy than the aroma. There is coriander, cardamom, and orange. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a chewy texture. Overall, this is a decent witbier that I would drink again. I just wish the aroma weren't so airy."
"Overall a very solid little ale and one that I needed to take a break from the rest of the evening!"
"Pours a hazy, gold color. 6/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight floral, slight pale malt, slight spice, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight hop, hint of spice, slight pale malt, and hint of citrus. Overall, good appearance, feel, and blend. The body is lacking, even for a Witbier."
"Overall- This one was great but since the day (extremely cold), I would rather drink IPA's, Barley Wines, or even Winter Ales that go more with the weather. Would love to try more from the Alaskan Brewing Co. because their 2 beers I had were A's for sure! Going to look for their beers in bottle when I get a chance."
"A drinkable enough beer that will probably be better when you need to change up styles, hot day, girlfriend beer etc. . ."
"Alaskan has done better to me in the past, and I won't let this one turn me off of a solid brewery, but I say pass on the Alaskan White."
"O: Very drinkable, which is nice, but the craftsmanship? Above average, and balanced, but not unique to bold. Could drink quite a bit, which is nice, but not a stand out beer."
"The beer looks like Blue Moon - that is to say like a pale wheat ale - and has a similar aroma but with a touch more malt and a bit of spice to it. Taste was fairly light and I couldn't really get into it. Not much here - made me wonder if they actually just had a tap running from the Blue Moon keg, which in all honesty, judging from the kind of place this was, they might have. I'll take their word for it. All in all not a bad beer, definitely drinkable and washed bar food down well - burgers and wings - but not a very good example of a wit. Disappointed, as Alaskan is usually excellent. This one was just meh..."
"I dig spiced witbiers like this, so i figured i would give Alaskan's version a shot. I find it to be adequate, but nothing compared to other spiced beer like Albino Python or Witch's Wit. Pours nice, has tons of carbonation, but flavors seem muted. I don't get the sense of earthiness or fragrance like other wits. I would only do one of these at a time because i wasn't a big fan of how it would taste towards the end of the bottle."
"D) Not impressed. I won't be having another one of these. Disappointing compared to quality of the other Alaskan brews I've had."
"This was a very disappointing beer for me, I expected much more. I didn't get much head, much lacing or anything really that impressive appearance wise. The smell and taste were just the same. I got very little spice notes and NO fruit, I assume most witbiers should have some fruit in them, maybe this one wasn't supposed to, I dunno. But either way, very little spice in this and VERY little wheat. There isn't much I hate more than a small amount of wheat in a beer. It honestly just felt like a watered down beer to me. I could tell they obviously didn't water down the beer to save money, that would have tasted terrible, but i just got that feeling, not much taste, not much anything. Oh well, it wasn't undrinkable, just not that great at all."
"Poured a hazy, yellowish-gold, with a light bubbly head. Typical citrusy nose of a wheat beer. Taste was citrusy, crisp, tart, and a bit acidic. Light-medium mouthfeel, some carbonation, a little rough going down. Somewhat drinkable and refreshing, but nothing extraordinary. Plus I'm not a huge fan of the style, so it takes a little more to get me to come back."
"While this brew is rather easy to drink, it most certainly borders on average - at least until the coriander and orange peel stop trying to beat everything else up. As far as I'm concerned, this beer is just short of the depth and complexity and missing a certain light fruitiness that is supposedly common in the witbier style. With all of the spices overshadowing everything, this almost tastes like it wants to be a holiday-type drink, and would probably be best enjoyed paired with a salad covered in rosemary vinaigrette or lemon and a white fish."
"I ended up seeing this in the store and brought home a six-pack. Not as good in the bottle, sitting in Long Beach as it is from the tap in Alaska, but still a beer that I'll buy on occassion. It's a re-do in my book."
"Kind of disappointing. Not one I'll be reaching for again."
"One of the strangest witbiers that I've come across, and very difficult to describe in detail. Almost medicinal, in its initial sweetness. Hmmm. Not something I would want to pursue."
"This is a very nice light beer for the dog days of summer, but I'm not really sure if I would call it a witbier. American Summer Wheat, perhaps, but lacking some of the dimension I expect in a nice witbier."
"Good drinking, but lacking character for the style. With that in mind, Alaskan White might be good while grilling outdoors, or if you're looking for a small beer, but there are tens of better tasting wits on the markets."
"Pours quite dark for a wit, more toward the amber side of the spectrum than the pale golden or cloudy white you'd expect. The tight head fades in fairly short order to a thin rim. Smells of coriander and dusky bitter orange with some wheat notes in the background. The taste is similar, with a peculiar herbal bitterness which is not from hops. The bitter orange lingers as well and makes it quite citrusy in that dried peel kind of way. I'd say there is simply too much coriander and orange here and it kind of makes the beer out of whack. It also lacks that zingy crispness that makes the style so pleasant and thirst quenching. Just okay."
"D- This is a pretty good summer time beer. Not the best wit out there, but it's drinkable and sessionable."
"I like this one, a very nice product."
"Overall: Perhaps this should be called American Wheat not a White. Its filtered and spice is light and yeast is probably not a white beer yeast its just a house ale yeast. They might solve a ton of problems if they changed the yeast."
"D- This beer isn't all that great. Would I want to drink another one? No."
"This is the first time I've had this beer, and I am surprised by how dark it is for a white beer. Medium golden blond, with a bit of white foam that dissipates fairly quickly. On the nose I get some Belgian yeast, banana, some wheat and a little peppery spice. Very fruity on the palate, a little lemon, some apricot and maybe pear/apple. Very dissimilar to most whites I've had, but refreshing and flavorful."
"M/D: light feel with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is ok but the taste seems off for a witbier and seemed harsh."
"I wasn't going into this with high expectations, but I was pretty impressed. The appearance is a clear-golden with a big head that disappears fast. I smell spices and some peppery notes. Slight sweetness on the nose as well. Interesting taste to this wheat beer. The wheat hits you in the face right away. This beer blows Blue Moon outta the water. Lot's of spice and very little hops, with a nice aftertaste. I would definitely buy this again as a 6 pack for a nice summer BBQ session beer."
"Taste sweetens as it warms and holds a firm spiced character, revealing a bit of citrus amongst a dense wheat feel. And while the wheat is detected in the feel it is a bit difficult to discern in flavor. A unique brew that is dry in a spice sense yet without being bitter, and offers a flash of citrus on the finish. I'm not quite sold on it however, as I find it too chalky in structure and with subtle wheat notes overwhelmed."
"Easy to drink. Good summer beer."
"Not quite to style but still pretty good."
"Overall this beer was kind of a disappointment. I am a fan of Alaska (the state) and my favorite animal is the bear. I have also recently tried other whites and hoped this would be the sleeper and slot in maybe 2nd place. However, I did not like the taste it had and that is a deal killer despite the nice smell and agreeable mouthfeel."
"Overall, a middle-of-the road wit that while drinkable just doesn't stand out. Mild recommend if you can easily get. Rotation - not avail here in TX so shipped to myself from CO. If here, maybe the occasional 6 pack in my wit rotation. For now, not worth shipping more but would try on-tap at least once while on the road. [O;O]"
"Appearance has a nice golden color with a lot of carbonation bubbling up feeding a crisp white head. Smell of wheat and light spice and faint citrus. Taste has a light sweet spiced wheat flavor. Mouthfeel is light - medium with good carbonation. A drinkable brew, but one I won't pay for again in awhile."
"I think this brew leaves a lot to be desired. Some more intense spicing, lighter carbonation, a heavier body, and a less filtered appearance would be required for the Alaskan White to stack up to its competition. I'm certainly fortunate to have been able to sample an Alaskan Brewing Co. beer (considering it isn't readily available out this way) but this one needs a little work."
"D - Relatively high given the very mild flavors and fairly low abv, not that you might really enjoy every moment of it..."
"Light golden body, a bit of chill haze, cleared up for the most part as it warmed. 1 finger white head, medium dissipation, with nice lacing. The nose is citrusy, the orange peel with a bit of lemon (Meyer lemon?) some spice notes, coriander with a bit of white pepper. The taste is, unfortunately, off, citrus prominent but overwhelmed by coriander, worse yet is this aggressive banana taste-is this a bad keg, big diacytel hit-ugh. A bit of hoppiness on the back end. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. This would certainly be tres drinkable on a hot summer day, wonder what this is doing being served in winter time. OK, but not in the league of Allagash or Hoegaarden."
"Disappointing."
"The color when poured was a medium amber brown, with very little foam but did have a lot of lace on the side of the glass the whole time. The smell of spice and mild hops had a pleasant aroma. The taste was of spices, mild hops and a hint of malts and yeast, as in bread taste. A very nicely balance of components, without the bittness. Drink and enjoy this White Ale for Alaska!"
"I was disappointed by this beer as I have really enjoyed the other offerings I have tried by this brewery, but this just reminded me too much of an adjunct lager to be enjoyable."
"Like most of Alaskan Brewing Co. beers, Alaskan White is built for easy drinking."
"Alaskan has better offerings."
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit it has a good taste thats easy to drink definitely worth picking up to try sometime"
"D=overall enjoyable beer, definitely drinkable."
"D: Sure its not crazy complex for the style or anything, but it is a decent representation for sure. This is very drinkable and refreshing. It could have a bit more going for it, but Wits are very touchy and easy to screw up (in my experience). With that said, I would absolutely have this brew again, especially during the summer months. Tasty and enjoyable."
"D: Very drinkable and a good summer beer. A good thirst quencher. A very occasional beer drinker would probably love this beer. On a hot day it could be a great, ice-cold session beer."
"D: This is an OK Wit in my book. The light body and low ABV make it an easy drinker. Not necessarily a beer I'm anxious to revisit."
"A nicely balanced thirst-quencher. A enjoyable witbier!"
"Quite drinkable but this just isn't a good example of the beer style. Try once and forget."
"Alaskan Brewing Company kicks out some pretty amazing beer. A significant chunk of their lineup, however, is merely better than average. Summer Ale, Winter Ale, Pale, Amber... and now White fall into that category. There are better wits out there for your drinking pleasure."
"D: Usually I like my wits to have a little more orange/fruit flavours in them. This one was a little to spicy and dry for me. Almost like a mix of an APWA and a wit. Just average."

"Overall impression: Not the most interesting beer, but its drinkable and has some decent flavors."
"Drinkability: it's more of a warm-weather beer, but drinkability is OK."
"Drinkability? I had 2 16 oz pints back to back($4 each) and they went down easily enough. Good brew."
"Basically I expected a Witbier, but got an American Wheat Ale w/ some spices."
"The body was light and smooth, almost average. This beer is very drinkable, but why bother? Drink this if your only other options are the BMC suspects, otherwise avoid it."
"If you really like Belgian Wits this should appeal to you. Having said that, this is actually pretty lackluster within the style. It is refreshing and quaffable and certainly hits the spot on a 110+ºF / 44+ºC day, but it is really lacking in depth and complexity (it is especially missing the fermentation / yeast derived character)."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is dry, carbonated, and astringent. The body of the beer is light, and the finish is medium. This is just okay, I feel it really lacks flavor and complexity of a good witbier. It had some odd astringent note from the hops that clashed with the spice added to the beer."
"Very drinkable and a good summer beer. A good thirst quencher and it could easily be served ice cold without losing much of the flavor."
"This beer is primarily noteworthy for it's bland drinkability. It hits the spot on a hot day the way that hundreds of run of the mill, ""lawnmower"" beers do. Not awful, but in no way memorable enough for me to bother with seeking out. Next time I'm in the mood for a U.S. wit, I'll grab a Zon from Boulevard."
"A nice drinkable summer session beer but not a lot else going on to keep my interest."
"Overall- Not very powerful in the flavor and aroma department. It's an average ale but nothing special."
"Nose has a small amount of spicy cardamom, with some gentle tangy wheat. Taste pretty much follows the nose, perhaps with more of the wheat character. Decent beer overall, but could use a little kick in the pants."
"Other comments: Not a challenger to the Belgian wits or the more notable American versions, but quite drinkable and refreshing, nonetheless."
"Pours a nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, slight spicyness. The taste is sweet for a Witbier, malty/yeasty, slightly spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little brew, I have three bottles of this, two are coming with me to Zion next weekend."
"Alaskan Brewing does a good job with this style. Not an easy one to nail down, this beer gets the delicate spices right. Corriander and Curraco orange peel set the stage for a silky and spicy beer. Set atop a firm malt base of wheat and pilsner malts, the yeasty phenols swirl around the peppery corriander and citrusy orange peel notes. At times the spices seem to dominated with a shakey wheat character. Wheat malts seem to give away some body and allow the acidity and minerally character to compromise the mouthfeel. The winter wheat and oat additions common to Belgian varieties don't seem to make the impact here that is needed. Still, a quality beer to enjoy during those hot Alaskan days (wait, what?). Thanks Clvand0!"
"Drinkability is just above average, but I still find it to be to spiced for my liking, and would prefer more fruit notes from the esters, although they definitely started to open up as it warmed. I just don't care for the bite that coriander provides..."
"This kind of reminds me of New Belgium Sunshine Wheat; very light, clean, with touch of orange. It really doesn't do much for me though. I would drink it ice cold on a hot day, or better yet, buy something tastier..."
"Drinkability: Certainly a fine choice from the bulk of mainstream US ""microbrews"". Makes for a good spring/summer brew."
"A good stab at the style, the playing field for this style has become a bit crowded these days though this one does a good job of standing out from most."
"Palate has a wheat malt focus up front to midway through, some pleasant fruity flavors, dash of sourness, and disappointing on the finish."
"D- This one is very easy to drink. I think it is an excellent addition to the lineup of beers Alaskan Brewing is putting out. This would make for a great summer time BBQ session brew."
"Drinkability is also ok. A decent wit, this has pleasant flavors, and is easy to drink. But, it needs some more complexity and a better body to be a really good one."
"overall an okay wit. a little light on the smell and a little on the watery side."
"Overall, a very good witbier. Very tasty and refreshing for a warm day. Definitely give this one a try."
