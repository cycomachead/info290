4.81,20.9,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"The beer has a great look, is is a little hazy, kinda orange, with a decent head and carbonation.  The smell jumps out at you, very spicy, I liked it very much and was very intrigued.  The taste followed the smell.  But the orange takes the lead instead of the spice, you really pick up the citrus, mostly orange.  There is some spice but it is perfectly subdued and also just a touch of sour.  After noticing the sour I then began to notice it in the smell.  The beer is very smooth and clean, extremely easy to drink and there is no notice of the 8% ABV.  Overall I was shocked how much I like this beer.  I will have to get another one of these.","JamieDuncan","Jan 10, 2015"

Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy brass-gold topped by a finger of white foam.  The nose comprises lemon zest, light Sunny D, clove, a touch of black pepper, and a hint of cracked wheat.  The taste brings in more of the same, a healthy amount of slightly tart lemon/clementine and orange guiding the spicy wheat ship to glory in the Napoleonic Wars.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a damn tasty wit, sorry, "Double Wit".  I need more of this...","TMoney2591","Aug 27, 2014"

Smells and tastes exactly like a 40-60 ratio hybrid between a Berliner Weiss and a higher-gravity Belgian Wit. (Tart lemony lactic pucker with florals, phenolics, and a touch of horseblanket funk combined with spiced citrus peel / citrus juice and garnished by white pepper.) Balanced exceptionally well in the precise middle point between dryness and sweetness. My only criticism is that the body came across as somewhat too far on the heavy side of medium thickness for my preferences, despite the valiant efforts of the carbonation, it got a bit sludgy and left a thin sort of residue / coating film on the inside surface of my mouth. But I can deal with it because the lingering film has a flavor that I actually enjoy. I just... wish it didn't cling so much.","WastingFreetime","Jul 22, 2012"

The tart does help balance out the sweet fruit flavors so they are not cloying. The mouthfeel is creamy with the tart dominating the finish. Overall a good wheat beer.

Aromas of big banana, pepper, clove, herbs, ginger, wheat, citrus, bubblegum, light bread, and yeast spices. Some very nice and highly complex aromas, with great balance. Taste of big banana, bubblegum, pepper, clove, apple, citrus peel, light herbs, bread, grainy tartness, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of banana, bubblegum, tart grain, bread, spices, and citrus on the finish for a bit. Medium body and elevated carbonation; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel, with some light prickly carbonation. Extremely smooth to drink; with pretty much no alcohol noticed at all for 8%. Overall this is an excellent imperial Witbier. Great balance of flavors; big complexity; and very smooth to drink for the level of alcohol. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jan 23, 2012"

The bitterness is acidic probably from orange peel and as mentioned on the label a lactic fermentation. No real flavor or smell of hops noted. No distinct flavor of sweetness or malt noted. I wish there would have been more flavor/spice from corriander or malt sweetness to balance the bitter fruit. Drinkability is good and beer has slight warming character.

This one's a step above most of the double wits I've had - most tend to be sickly sweet, or overly spiced, or spiced in an inauthentic way. This one keeps the yeast notes at bay, and augment them with authentic earthy spices and overtones, and has a dry enough malt backbone that nothing's cloying or overpowering. Indeed, it's one of the better examples of the style I've had the pleasure of drinking. Recommended, and an exemplary standout if BA ever gives the "doublewit" it's own style.","CrellMoset","Apr 03, 2010"

This beer pours a golden, hazy wheat with a big, fluffy, off white head that leaves no lacing as the beer recedes. This beer has some crazy head retention. There seems to be always an inch high hat sitting on top of my beer. The aroma is interesting. The first aroma that hits me is a slight lactic sourness that's backed up by some serious spicing. Cardamom, lemon zest, orange peel, clove all make an appearance. Also over ripe bananas and just a little bit of toast from the pale malts. The flavor is just as interesting. Its extremely spiced. Grains of paradise, cardamom, a bit of dried flowers, and clove all mashed together with some lemon peel. Also a slight toastiness to it. Unfortunately the slight sourness that comes out in the nose is completely lost on the flavor profile. I wish the Boulevard team would have sour mashed it a bit longer. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. I have to admit that I completely disliked this beer when it first came out, but it turns into a pretty easy drinking Wit. A lot of the sweetness died down which makes it easier to drink.","hwwty4","Jan 30, 2010"

Sweet spicy aroma, very floral, reminiscent of an Abbey Triple. Maybe coriander. Very fruity, light fruit like white grapes, pears. Not an overly strong aroma, might be related to the disappearing head. Sweet taste, orange peel, maybe clove. Not a strong taste. Diminishing aftertaste. Though a sweet spiciness lingers.

Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is lively yet smooth and creamy...wow! Full bodied and full flavored!! The earthy sweet grainy orange peel and balanced coriander taste rocks.

3.7,-7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy golden colore with a huge white head. In fact the first pour was a glass full of foam. The head slowly settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Big aroma of lemons, maybe some vanilla, and alcohol. Wheat malt flavor with citrus hints, mostly lemon, and yeast phenols. Alcohol warmth in the finish. No need for people to add a lemon to this beer. Carries the alcohol well. The beer label claims tartness but I could not detect any or any other added spice. Still has a nice flavor. Bigger body than the average wit as expected. The level of carbonation is lively without being harsh. Slightly tingling. I do not think it lives up to the claims it has on the label but still has nice flavors. The high ABV limits drinkability.","morimech","Jul 11, 2009"
4.23,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a cloudy, maize/golden color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, citrus (banana/orange), hop, sweet malt, and tart malt. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is tart, crisp, and slightly thick. There is a high carbonation level. Tastes of cinnamon, yeast, citrus (banana), sweet malt, tart malt, and slight hop. Overall, a good blend, body, and great looking brew.","Tone","Jul 11, 2009"

4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked up a bottle at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove, MN for $9 or $10 and was not disappointed. This is another great addition to the Smokestack Series, I wish the regular line of Boulevard beers were this delicious. Now it's a heavily spiced beer and hits the threshold of non-beer flavors, but doesn't cross the line. The flavor, upfront, is a gentle mix of coriander (strongest flavor) followed by the grains of paradise (with a black pepper edge) and lavender. Of course in the background the yeast character comes through with mild vanilla and peppercorn, and a bit of bready wheat also pipes in to remind you of the malt bill. Certainly my favorite doube-wit to date. Very subtle, very deliicous.","tempest","Jul 05, 2009"
4.84,21.6,4,5,5,4,5,"This beer pours a cloudy orange color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes slowly into a full cap of lacing. This beer is a little darker than most traditional wit, but it's not a traditional wit. The aroma is cardamom, lavender and other soft floral notes, hints of black pepper, and very faint wheaty notes. This is a great smelling beer. It has both strength and complexity. The taste is more aggressive than the aroma. There is a lot of cardamom, hints of lavender, a lot of citrus, and a nice wheaty tang. Akin to the aroma, this is a great tasting beer. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. It is by far the best Imperial Wit I've yet taste. In fact it is the only good Imperial Wit I've yet tasted. Not because it is as close to tasting like a traditional wit as it can be, but because it is an extremely well crafted fusion of spices (some traditional, some not), and the traditional wheaty, tangy, citrus flavors of a Witbier. I really like how in the end I am tasting mostly Imperial Wit, but I can always taste reminders of the style it evolved from. Way to go Boulevard for creating such a unique, and tasty beer. Thank you.","KarlHungus","Jul 05, 2009"

4.28,7.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Sampled from bottle. Pours cloudy yellow-orange with a creamy white head and thick lace. The aroma is subtle with some banana and pepper. Balanced, with bold yeast character. There's lots of pepper/clove and I'm assuming Boulevard went with another yeast for this beer other than a traditional wit biere yeast. The yeast character resembles what you'd find in a Belgian Strong Golden. There is some orange in the finish, but I'm missing the corriander's perfume. Medium bodied and highly drinkable for an 8% abv beer. This is the best 'double wit' that I've tried so far. Recommended!","Bdc","Jun 19, 2009"
4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A huge off-white head grows quickly and sticks around for a bit before fading and leaving curly chunks of lacing behind. Color is a hazy, pale yellow. Smells like a tyical wit, except all the elements are deeper, more robust. Coriander, malts, lemon, light fruit and green grass all mix well and rise pleasantly to the nose. Taste sweet and tangy with orange zest, sweet malts, lemon, yeast and a slight hint of alcohol heat in the end. Has a true medium body, and is well carbonated. This style seems to have had some problems moving into the double/imperial spectrum, but the Two Jokers hits the nail on the head. A near perfect balance across the spectrum, and a big character that doesn't sacrifice drinkability, but lets you know this isn't your father's witbier, makes for a spot on brew I will continue to seek out.","stephens101","Jun 19, 2009"
3.65,-8.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Highly carbonated, a little thin but just fine for style. Lots of carbonation in the finish, a little biting with the citrus and herbs. Not a bad take, but not among my favorites.","BretSikkink","Beers"

I have a mixed reaction to this beer - I really like it, but it doesn't meet the monumental expectations I created for it in my head. After the rest of the Smokestack series, I was expecting my dream beer. I'm guessing it is impossible to live up to that expectation.","katan","0"

Highly carbonated mouthfeel - I enjoy it quite a bit. More spicy clove in the taste; also present is a very slight tartness reminiscent of a very mild sour. Alcohol isn't too noticeable. The third double wit I've ever had and definitely the best.","HoppyMcStout","Jun 11, 2009"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"750ml bottle $8.49. Vibrant, bright orange color. looks like a nectar, not much head when poured into a wine glass.

4.18,5,5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a very good witbier--on the verge of being great. Starts with fresh coriander, orange peel, and orange flesh. Slightly sour tartness blends with a nice backbone of crystal malt. A quick flash of boozy heat and sharp, grassy spices cut across the back of the palate alongside a spritzy carbonation level. The medium-light body finishes on the dry side, with a burst of funky sourness. All in all, Boulevard has crafted a beautiful example of the Witbier style that packs heftier-than-normal booze and spices, but doesn't over-do it and still maintains its drinkability. Bravo!","wagenvolks","Jun 07, 2009"

Yes and no in that order. Wow, I mean...wow. Just when you think the style has nothing left to offer, Two Jokers comes around. This is a tremendous wit and this is coming from someone who isn't even much of a wit fan. I think this has Southampton, Allagash, St. Bernardus, Hitachino, and La Grande Blanche all beat. In my book, this is the new champion of the witbier category.","BradLikesBrew","May 09, 2009"
